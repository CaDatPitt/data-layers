A female Pittstudent was
killed early yesterday morning
when the car she was riding in_
struck a telephone pole on
Forbes Avenue.

Coming home * from
Mitchell's Restaurant at 2 a.m.,
the driver of the car, Michael
Brady, lost control near Shady
Avenue. The passenger side of
the car struck the telephone

, pole, killing the victim instant-
ly, according to City Police
Officer Regis Kleppic of the
Traffic Accident Investigation
Unit.

The "victim, a member’ of
Alpha Epsilon Phi, was identi-
fied yesterday afternoon by her
parents, according to Kleppic.‘

“We were going crazy all
day today trying to find out
who the girl was,” Kleppic

name because she was carry-

Brady suffered critical head,
neck and chest injuries in the
accident and was upgraded to
fair condition yesterday at

Hospital.

According to WPXI-TV,

Members of Alpha Epsilon
Phi gathered in Amos Hall last
night after receiving word of
the victim’s death from

SGB has plans to complete many
goals and projects this tern/z

By Beth Kovaly
and Christine Hanna ‘
The Pitt News

At last week’s Student
Government Board—spon-
sored open forum, SGB
President Jacob Brody said
that -it is now time to move
on and let SGB get to work.

The board members are
now concentrating on their
individual projects.

Board member Brian
Bolton is working on the
renovation of the residence
halls. Floors 14 through 22
in Tower B will be coin-
pletely renovated this sum-
mer. He is also looking into
the renovation of the
Holland Hall lounges.

He is in the process of
setting up an appointment
with Athletic Director Oval
Jaynes to discuss the acade-
mic and personal services
offered to student athletes.

Bolton said that he would
like to design a pamphlet
for first—year stumkdents to
give them a list ofacademic
services.

More student forums is
another point on his agen-
da. Through these forums,
Bolton said SGB can find
out exactly what students
want. ‘

He also said he would like
to talk with Pitt Program
Council to discuss next fall’s
Homecoming. The current
homecomings are “a waste

of time and promotion,” he

said, and next fall’s should

be “a real active week.”
Board member Joe Foner

has designed a survey to

hand out to student organi-
zations and students.
Through the results of the
survey, he said he will find
his “concrete policy goals.”
He said that any concerns
that he sees being repeated
on the surveys and are not
already being taken care of

 

by another board member,
he will _look into.

Although a month of the
term has passed, he hopes

' to start getting results by the

end of February.

He is also working with
member August Imholtz on
researching the fifth floor of
the William Pitt Union. Their
goal is purely researching
the student organizations’
process of obtaining and
retainingcubicles.

Board member Thomas
Grassia said that he is work-

ing with the committee on

renovating Bellefield Annex,
part of Governor Casey’s
Project Jumpstart.

One of her main goals,
she said, is to get input
from the" entire student

“I would like to know
what students feel should be
represented in the multicul-
tural center,” she said. “It’s
not going to be a biased
center, it is going to be very
equal”

phlet out by the end of this
term. .

The pamphlet would
include lists of scholarships
and their monetary values.

Board member Tony
Moody said he is working
on several projects this
term.

He started making
phone calls to students to
ask what SGB can do for
them but has heard no new
information. Although
response was not helpful,
he said the project is worth
continuing.

He said he is going to
work with safety in resi-
dence halls. He wants “to
alleviate the problems of
fire alarms.”

The University Book
Exchange Referral System,
Moody said, will be a pro-
ject that he will start work-
ing on at the beginning of
April with cos. ‘ B y
working together, U.B.E.R.S.

will become more successful
next semester, he said.

He said that he will also
work with the University
Book Center and its pro-
gram of collecting old edi-
tion textbooks.

Board member David Ott
has already presented
Marylin Ross, director of
Trees Hall, with approxi-
mately 20 proposed hour
changes.

“She accepted about two
of them, so I was pretty
happy. It’s going to extend
them a couple hours,” he
said.

He said the decisions are
based around the new con-
vocation center.

“Once the center gets
built, then Trees Hall will
be completely open to the
students, [Ross] says. Until
then, it all has to do with
budget constraints,” he said.

“My other plan was to try
and get athletic trainers for

the clubs, like rugby,
lacrosse, and that’s really
tough,” he said.

He would also like to
work with the bulletin
board in the lower level of
the union. The improve-
ments would include adding
the different activities that
are taking place at Trees
Hall.

“I think it would benefit
Trees Hall,” he said.

Board member Ted

Schroeder said that he wants

to improve the student
directory.
“My concern is that it

doesn’t have any off-campus
phone numbers in it. It’s
basically an on-campus
directory,” he said. “I want
to see if next year we can
try to get off-campus num-
bers and addresses in
there.”

He said that he is working
with Brody to improve com-
munications with gover-

nance groups.

“Jacob and I are going
to try and organize
monthly meetings with Dr.
Harmon and the presidents
of the seven groups. [This
way] we know where
they're at and they know
where we're at, and hope-
fully we can work better,”
he said.

He has also been working
with Bolton to look into
landlord problems.

“I sat down and talked
with the lawyer. Basically
there’s nothing concrete we
can do legally,” he said.

Even though legally
SGB cannot do anything,
he is going to compile as
many complaints as possi-
ble.

“I’d like to get something
together to take to the
freshmen, these are things
you should look for when
looking for an apartment,”

he said.

Students andsafety    

      

 
   

Safety is a very serious topic on college campuses, more so
for students at Pitt. With the crime rates between ‘91’ and ‘92
rising, we as students and residents of Pittsburgh have to be
more careful. The university can be a dangerous place if stu—
dents don’t use the facilities provided and make themselves
aware of their surroundings. J

Pitt is not like othercollege campuses in that it is barely dis-
tinguishable from the outside community. The feeling of safety
created by a college atmosphere is very misleading with
Oakland and the Hill District as our borders. We have to think
at all times in terms of what is safe and what is not, never let-
ting our guard down. Anything can happen, whether you are
in Forbes Quad, the lobby of the Towers or on Craig or
Atwood Streets. , I C

To help bring down the crime. rates at this university, Pitt

_ officials have taken steps to help us help ourselves remain

safe. First, we have the shuttle system. There is a shuttle that
goes just about anywhere you need to go — North Oakland,
South Oakland, Sutherland Hall, the upper campus and a gen-
eral campus bus. Van-Calls one and two are also available with
just a phone call to take students to locations not covered by
other shuttles but within certain boundaries off campus. ‘

Then there is the extra lighting and the escort service. Some
of the lighting around campus has already been improved, and
the escort service is in the works. Self-defense classes are also
available at Pittthrough ca_mpus police officer Curtis Smith.

As students attending school on an inner-city campus, we
should use the services that we have been provided. There is
no excuse to take risks. Use the shuttle services, especially at
night, and be aware of the area you are in.

No more Arena

It is dead quiet. The action seems far away. You are bored
enough ‘that you start counting the plentifu.l empty seats all
around. This isnot church, indoor soccer or even a Pirate game.

Welcome to Pitt basketball at the Civic Arena.

Now it is uncontrolled bedlam. Lunatics abound. You can’t hear
yourself think amid the raucous sound and explosive emotion.

. This is Pitt basketballat Fitzgerald Field House, where it
belongs. ,

Orat least until this university builds a new on-campus facility
that islarger, yet still cozy enough to retain the sights, sounds and
flavors of big-time college basketball. Arena games remove the
fans from the game. inevitably, this removes Pitt’s homecourt

. advantage almost completely.

Ask Paul Evans. Ask any player on the Panther basketball team.
They would much rather play their games at the Field House,
where opponents mysteriously lose many of their basketball skills.
Pitt is a perfect 8-0 at the Field House and 37-4 in the last four
seasons there. Not bad. Those are the kinds of numbers that earn
a national reputation for excellence and cause visiting teams to
question their chances before the games even begin.

The Panthers are mere mortals at the Civic Arena, with a life-
time record of 35-58. Their only “home” loss of the season came
there last Wednesday against Syracuse. Regardless of any reason
school officials give about Arena games bringing in more money,
there are very limited benefits, if any at all, to be gained by play-
ing there. Pitt needs to concentrate on winning basketball games.
If the team does that, money "takes care of itself because winning
breeds enthusiasm — whichbreeds fan and alumni support —
which provides this program the opportunity to recruit higher cal-
iber players. All the money in the world cannot provide that same
opportunity. '

Keystone Cops are alive and Well

It was 12:50 on Tuesday night
when my friend and I were leav-
ing the computer lab in David
Lawrence Hall. After a tedious
day of studying, we were anxious
to go home. We reached a set of
doors that read “Use these doors
only after 12:00”. So we did, or
should I say tried.

“Dave, the doors are locked,”
said my faithful companion.

“So they are,” I said after anoth-
er unsuccessfu-l attempt. “No
doubt our crackerjack campus
police are apprehending another
life—threatening criminal. The only
way to stop this menace to soci-
ety was to seal off the building,
and thus trap him inside.”
~ We then went back to the lab
to infomrthe output man that we
were locked in. He then called
the campus police and told them
they locked 50 innocent college
students inside DLH. Within 15
_minutes we were free. _

Just another example of how
effrcientour campus police actu-
ally are. Even such elusive crimi-

Students should support all teams

In the 25 January unsigned edito-
rial “Pitt basketball is hot,” Woe Pitt
News derides the student body for
showing a lack of interest inthe

-men’s basketball team, for failing to

display “unabashed enthusiasm”
even though the student section is
filled to “near capacity.”

Nowhere is the even more
pathetic lack of support for the Pitt

women’s basketball team men- _

tioned. At women’s games a crowd
of more than 150 is astonishing ——
this for an excellent, exciting team
which is having one of its best sea-
sons in recent years. These athletes

- deserve our support just as much

as their male counterparts do.
Recently, Sports Illustrated men-
tioned Pitt as a school where glar-
ing gender inequities in sports
occur; this is a situation being
investigated by the Provost’s
Advisory Committee for women’s
concerns. I call upon Pitt students
to support both women’s and
men’s athletic teams.

human rights and the environment
that it has been necessary for UA to

exemption from all U.S. religious,

tion laws. Incredibly, Chancellor
O’Connor chooses to involve Pitt in
such a controversial project without
even consulting Pitt’s own biology

experts.

How can Chancellor O’Connor
bring Pitt a legacy of cultural geno-
cide and species extinction to a
center of higher learning when
other astrophysical sites exist in the
world that would not bring Pitt
such dishonor. Pitt alumni will
think twice before donating to a

  .wednesaay, February 3, 1993

By Rob Pugliese
Sports Assistant

Being the hunted is a dan-
gerous way to live.

Pitt found that out when the
Syracuse Orangemen irrever-
ently stomped on the Panthers’
four-game winning streak last
Wednesday night.

A ft e r

t o i l i n g

for weeks

t o e a r n

respect, Pitt

fell flat on

i t s f a c e

against a scorching Orange

assault and learned a hard les-

son -— its underdog status has

all but disappeared, replaced
by a big, bold bull’s-eye.

The Panthers have had a
solid week to retool and reload
with the Big F.ast’s basement
dwellers coming to the Civic
Arena. Villanova enters
tonight‘s nationally-televised
contest struggling at 6-9 (2-7 in
the Big East).

The Cats are coming off an
82-6‘) whipping of Miami
Saturday night. Prior to that,
‘Nova had dropped seven con-
secutive conference games.
However, last season the
Wildcats dropped six straight at
one point, only to rebound
and close with six straight wins
and barely missing the NCAA
Tournament.

Among those six wins was a
78-61 thrashing of Pitt in the
last meeting between these
clubs. The \Vildcat cast remains
almost in tact. but Steve Lappas
is now the man in charge. The
transition from Rollie
Massimino to Lappas has been

a rocky one thus far — espe-
cially for senior Lance Miller.
Not many players have

Miller’s smooth skills. And after
three stellar seasons the versa-
tile 6-foot-6-inch senior for-
ward expected an offensive in
‘S92-’95. He has yet to rise to
that next level, currently aver-
aging 13 points, 4.1 rebounds
and 5.2 assists.

Miller has spent a great deal
of his career as Villanova’s go-
to guy. The problem for three
years has been a stagnant
offense that often broke down,
leaving Miller to create oppor-
tunities out of nothing.

The arrival of Lappas
brought a new system,
and with that, renewed enthu-
siasm.

Point guard Jonathon Haynes
appeared capable of blossom-
ing into one of the confer-
ence’s elite playmakers, and
athletes such as Miller and
Calvin Byrd seemed destined
to flourish this season.

That scenario has not unfold-
ed, but Haynes has made his
presence felt nonetheless. A
tremendous ballhandler and
creator, the lanky 63" sopho-
more has averaged 11.5 points,
5.4 assists and 3.2 boards.

Pitt assistant coach Joe
DeSantis said the Panthers are
concerned about matchups,
specifically the size advantage
that Haynes and his backcourt
playmate, explosive rookie
Kerry Kittles, have over Pitt’s
guards.

“I think the biggest thing that
may present a problem is their
guards. They have pretty good
si’/.e," Desantis said. “We have
good size on our frontline, but
they're pretty big in the back-
Court."

Obviously Jerry McCullough
will be overmatched size-wise,
and Haynes could do serious

Fight with Wildcats is key for Pitt

For all those sniveling souls who haven’t yet
found it in their souls to purchase a seat at the
Arena for tonight’s Pitt-Villanova matchup (sev-
eral thousand seats are still available, folks!)
take heart. You’re only missing out on the most
important game of the season.

Yeah, yeah, I hear yer yap-
ping! Every game from here on
out is the most important game
of the year for head coach Paul
Evans and company, right?
Playing it “one game at a time”
is always the way to go, huh
basketball boy? Whadda ya saying, G?

Here’s the deal. The Panthers are looking
down the barrel of a brutal-but-conquerable
four-game stretch —— with back-to-back home
jobbers vs. ‘Nova and Big East leader St. John’s,
followed by roadblock matchups at Seton Hall
and Illinois. How they respond to last week’s
debacle against Syracuse tonight -— against a
should-be sure win — will play a huge role in
how the rest of the so-far, so-good Panther sea-
son plays out.

A win against the beatable Wildcats puts the

Brian
Gallagher

Panthers in prime position to control their des-
tiny in league play — setting up back-to-back
battles against the conference-leading Redmen
and runner—up Pirates for first-place in the Big
East. They will forget about Adrian Autry and
the Orangemen zone night-
mare and start_thinking about
first place in the Big East.

But if they lose? If they lose its
trouble city, 1993. It’s “Return
of the Indecisive and Pensive
Panthers,” the “Let’s Just Try to
Finish Fourth in League Play”
Panthers.

A loss draws Pitt’s losing skid to two in many
categories -— at home, against weaker oppo-
nents and in games when they had the oppor-
tunity to leap to the top of the conference
standings. Not only will they drop to 6-4 in the
league, but they'll likely drop even lower in the
motivational category most in need of a boost
in the months of February and March —— confi-
dence.

The defensive play of Marlon Rhymes and the other Panther guards will be an important
factor in Pitt's game against Villanova tonight.

Williams returns from injury to run in record-breaking relay

By Matt Groff
Staff Writer

Following almost two years of absence
from indoor track competition, Pitt senior
Allison Williams said she was a bit shaky
before she returned to competition last
month. ,

“I knew I could still compete, but I also
knew from fall practices that I wasn’t back
in my rhythm,” Williams said of returning

after sitting out her junior year due to a
stress fracture in her shin.

“Personal rhythm is highly important in
my events, and the long layoff certainly
was a setback.”

If her January perfomiance is any indi-
cation, Williams definitely has her rhythm
back.

She is a major contributor to the recent
success of the Pitt women’s indoor track
team. The Panthers have turned in strong

performances against Big East rival
Syracuse and teams from the ACC and
SEC. Ev.en though most of these meets

have been non-scoring, Williams’ top

placements are building her momentum
heading into the Big East Championships
on Feb. 20.

Her most recent achievement was as
anchor of the Pitt 4 x 55-meter shuttle
relay team which set a world record at the
Eastern Michigan Invitational. This feat

capped a month in which she qualified

"for NCAA national championships, NCAA

division finals and ECACs in the 55-meter
hurdles while setting a Pitt record and fin-
ishing first twice.

This does not sound like the result of a
nervous return.

“I’d say that my confidence returned
once I got past that first race in January,"
Williams Said. “After competing against

damage offensively. At 6’5”,
Kittles has been a pleasant
surprise in the off-guard
slot. The combination of
Ahmad Shareef, Garrick
Thomas and Marlon Rhymes
needs to step up for the
Panthers on both ends of
the floor.

Pitt could not solve
Syracuse’s zone defense and
could see more zones from
here on out. 0

However, Desantis point-
ed out that ‘Nova deploys
predominantly a man-to-
man defense. Despite
potential mismatches,
Desantis believes Pitt needs
to stay with its strengths.

“Our philosophy here is
we try and worry about
what we do best," he said.
“The Syracuse game is over
and I think we’ve -put the
last game behind us. The
way the Big East is going in
the standings, it doesn’t take

Villanova

a rocket scientist to see that
you have to take it one
game at a time.”

The same holds true
for ‘Nova. If the Wildcats
hope to climb a few rungs
in the standings, they’ll
need to put together a
streak.

Traditionally, Villanova
has been tough on Pitt, so
the Panthers must be pre-
pared for anything.

This is a crucial game for
the Panthers. A win tonight
would move them within a
half game of first place St.

_]ohn’s. The Redmen, 7-2 in

conference play, have a
date with the Panthers
Saturday night at Fitzgerald
Field House. ,

“We’re fortunate because
our chemistry clicked right
away,” DeSantis said. “Our
guys have got to under-
stand, we went from the
hunter and now we're the
hunted.”

runners I knew I’d face at the
Big East Championships, I had a
good idea of how far along I
actually was.”

According to Pitt women’s
track Coach Steve Lewis,
Williams was well on her way.

“She had a superb perfor-
mance,” Lewis said after the
Virginia Tech Invitational. “She
certainly ran one of the best
times in the country at this point
in this season in the 55-meter
hurdles.”

Even though she came a long
way from her junior year injuries,
Williams is no stranger to record
books at Pitt. In her sophomore
year, she set a Pitt indoor record
in the 55—meter hurdle at the Big
East Championships and the Pitt
outdoor record in the 100—meter
later that year.

“Records are not something

which I pay much attention,”
Williams said. “Coach [Lewis] sets
goals for us and that is what we
shoot for, not breaking times.
Recently we’ve been aiming to
qualify for ECACs and
Nationals.”

Since Williams and several of
her teammates have qualified for
ECACS in the past three weeks,
she says she is concentrating on
working hard in practice for a
successful run at placing near the
top of the region.

“Most of the meets we attend
are invitationals, so it’s hard to
tell how good the overall com-
petition [at the ECACs] will be,”
Williams said. “In conference
championships, according to
Coach Lewis, we have a chance
at finishing in the top three in
the Big East.”

Despite her victorious personal
comeback, Williams is the last

person to take any credit for the
Panthers’ recent success.

She views her role as a steady
performer who is willing and
able to compete in several
events.

Williams points to others
who have boosted her return
season.

“There are many reasons, but I
think a big factor is the talent of
our-freshman class,” Williams
said. “Because of freshmen con-
tributions, there is no pressure
on upperclassmen to pull the
load.”

In fact, Williams describes
meets as “fun” because of the
team’s high caliber of talent in
every area.

“A lot of runners travel to com-
petitions and are successful,”
Williams said. “The key to this
team is the versatility and the
way we support each other.”
