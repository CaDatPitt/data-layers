have been notiﬁed that bids for
themes must be in by Wednes-

please the alumna who may iden-
tify their college years with cer-
tain songs of their era!”
Bender also stated that the

' committee would determine which

groups would be working together
on ﬂoats this year instead of fol-
lowing the precedent set in other
years when fraternities have‘ in-
vit sororities or other groups to
work with them. This new meth-
od is backed, strongly by SGA.
Overall Homecoming chair-

cially the idea that Homecoming
this year is to be a week long
celebration instead of’ a one-day
event. , T _

 L A Ne w Registration Plan
 ” One of the more dynamic changes instituted for this

 school year was the new method’ of registration.
Unfortunately everything’ did not go as smoothly as

 

 use. Thus, one part of ‘registration had to be shoved into
 a room much too small for its purpose. A near~record
" number of students hadto be shunted through this room
and in and out a number’ of lines. ,
However, part of the dilemma was ‘solved midway
‘through the Wednesday registration-when officials decided
J to eliminate the picking up of clear cards. The second day,
. Thursday, was relatively smooth, and it. seemed that regis-
tration was to be only a one-day problem.

But the troubles returned against last Tuesday as stu-
-dents, lined up in the Commons Room and all around the out-

- side of the Commons Room to obtain change of course cards.

Only two hours were allotted for such alterations: An

 

 ‘used because all the card ‘desks had to be staffed.

 A similar situation occurred on the second day of
 classes until those in charge of the proceedings hit upon
. ' . another change. This time , they eliminated the ‘ second
‘ _ check on changes in sections and courses.

' transitional stage from the old method of registration -

 , which saw everyone ﬁghting for class cards —— to a new
iohe which, when_ implemented, may come close-to a panacea
for all registration woes. 

The long-range plan, which calls for the elimination of
the ‘present system of registration, is ..a creditable one.
Eventually, every student will be registered for a semester
during the previous term.

When he returns to school in the fall, he immediately

 

to schedule his courses.

 

Even in this system, problems will arise, such as what.

could a student do if, during the summer months, hechanges
_ his mind about some of the courses for, which he had pre-
 ' = I registered. In time, though, we feel certain these individual
problems could be solved. A I -
We only hope that the-planners of such a system work
quickly enough and wiselyenough so that there will be no
repeat of the hiatus of the past two. weeks. ‘

Summer Report; 1. ..

August in Pari

By David Breaksfone
Attempting , to write about my European sum-

mer just a week after returning is like trying to '

count the bistros -in Paris: the result is fragmen-
tary, incomplete, because my thoughts, like Paris-
ian bistros are innumerable and disorganized.
Perhaps the very unconnected nature of my
recollections is a good thing in
terms of writing, for«I am forced
to move chronologically’ back-
ward picking up the remains of
travel. and reconstructing from
memory the events of eleven
weeks abroad.’ ,
Starting with those things
freshest in my mind, I will try
to sketch and reflect upon the
experiences which appear to
have either meaning, novelty,
or humor from thedubious “dis-

-tance” of seven ' days.

After a week in London, a month studyingthe
French language at the University 'of,Grenoble,' and
three weeks of touring Italy and central‘ France, _I‘

arrived in a somewhat ' deserted Paris on August _

22. By somewhat deserted I mean that many_ of
the 2% million Parisians were on vacation, leaving
thousands of stores and" shops closed during :the
last two weeks in August. I had been forewarned-
of this situation, but rather than. unfortunate, I
found it quite pleasant.

‘The People of Paris

At its best Paris is the most densely. populated
city of " the world, provokingly alive :’,Wlth_ its
variety of different quarters and. _a multitude of
assorted nationalities peopli'ng_ those. quarters- ith
the city normally teeming with people. and their
diverse .activities,. the stranger is. often bemused
and bewildered by this kalaedoscopic effect of
Paris. _ ‘

But at the end"-of August, life moves calmly,
even serenely, as the police refrain from racing
their scooters on the sidewalks, the Eiﬁel ‘Tower
is uncrowded at sunset,‘ and in the evenings, the
cool breezes of approaching‘ Autumn ﬂoat along
rapidly with the swift, current of the black Seine.

About the only person available in quantity, is
the “American To'urist,”_ that strange and wonder-
ful creature who manages to be everywhere 
Europe at all times ‘— in a Left Bank cave, in the
most out-of-the-way silver shop. in Florence, in
the, crypt of the long-neglected church in «Rome.

Perhaps Parisians know that the Americans are U

coming and get out of town. But, that, hardly _
seems likely when one remembers the 'Pa“risia_'n
attraction to American dollars. The [statement may

‘sound a bit harsh, but it is nonetheless. a true one. V

Janice .Finds Herself In . . . V .

 

s

In fact, that may be the only thing that the
Paris dweller likes about Americans. He cer-
tainly doesn’t like American manners, dress, or
values, and is usually not embarrassed to voice his
criticism, or even unfriendliness. But Paris is too
full of art, architecture, I and history to permit a
slightly jaded populace to spoil a short visit.

In wandering about for 12 days, I saw much
of the variety and beauty of the French capital.
I tend to overuse the word “variety” in connection
with Paris, but the fault is almost unavoidable. If
Shakespeare’s Cleopatra was blessed with “inﬁnite
variety,” then so is the tourist’s Paris.

Paris had something unique too, at the end of

this ‘particular August, because the President of"

the United States was coming to’ pay a visit. As
previously mentioned, Parisians don’t particularly

like Americans, and this animosity has‘ been rem. ‘ '

phasized during General de Gaulle’s year as Presi-
dent'.,of the Fifth Republic. ,

De Gaulle has been insistent that France’s«role
in the Western Alliance must. not be, subordinate

to that of the U. ‘S. and England. He has claimed‘

that-. France must have nuclear weapons, and has

announced that French atom bomb testing‘ will.
:begin soon in thezsahara.

‘ U.S. Bad Boys

The United States had :been_ pictured in France , .

;,as_ the selfish big brother who, won’t/ share the-

“toys,” and insists on calling the tune. In addi-

tion, Mr. Eisenhower had been caricatured as ’ a

sick, inept leader who was practically 1 ‘impossible
to get along with. . ‘ _-

But all of the antipathy began to disappear
four ‘days before’ Ike’s arrival. "I‘he--press, ' from

left ‘to right (from L’Express to L’Humanite) open-
ly welcomed Eisenhower, and pointed to7him as a

new .~ symbol of hope in the West. A municipal
proclamation ‘appeared on billboards‘ and kiosks
around the ‘city, announcing the President’s, visit to
Paris, -asking that a civic celebration ,welcome
him and proclaiming the afternoon of ,Wednesday,
September 2, a municipal holiday. _
There was.noticeable~excitement in the cit , on

the day’ beforehis arrival as the Tricolor and 48, I’
'49, and 50 star versions of the American flag ap-
peared on buildings and on, lamp posts: along the
. broad __‘boulevards,.

The Lafayette Galleries, one
of the largest department stores in Paris, produced

-a_ four-‘story, tri-colored sign, which said, in English,

.“We Like Ike.” Peddlers wer_e doing a brisk _ cor.-

ner business with small American ﬂags" that eve-‘

ning, and on more than one radio, I heard the

,“Star Spangled Banner.” " » .
p _ September 2 was" to be a -most memorable day ~
for Paris.’ ‘

 Says Panthers To Have
 6-4 Record At Finish

By LARRY HAGGERTY
« Well, its back to the -football races again after a three
month vacation, and this season, the ﬁnish line should be
interestizng to watch where the Panthers are concerned.
 Year after year the .schedu»le.gets tougher and tougher and
if, 1959 proves to be no exception. .

has tutored his team to two Bowl games with an overall
23-l7-‘2 record. Nearly all -of the losses were to teams ranked
in the Nation’s top ten. ' C

This season’s schedule, which everyone again terms
tough, -includes Marquette, Southern -California, UCLA, Duke,
West Virginia, TC'U, Syracuse, Boston College, Notre Da-me,
and ‘Penn State.

National grid experts looking over the tea-ms this season
have placed the Jungle Cats no higher than fourth in the
East, but a poll of the writers and broadcasters at the ﬁrst
Panther football luncheon _at Gustine’s differed somewhat as

to how many games the Panthers will win during the 1959?

campaign. .

, Panther publicity man Beano Cook fears the -worst and
figures his ‘boys will ﬁnish with a 3-7 record. Joe ‘Tu-cker,
Ray Scott, and __Jack Henry, however, all see the Blue and
Gold winning eight of their ten games, but George Kiseda,
Roy McHugh, and Jack Sell agreed on a 6-4 chart. Mal
Alberts and Myron Cope made respective guesses of 6-3-1
and 5-5. .

As far as I am concerned it is almost senseless to pick
the won and lost columns ahead of time, _b/ut after winning
last year’s Yogi championship I feel conﬁdent that I wi-ll
be able to outguess my boss, Murray, once again and retain

, my title. Here are my selections for the upcoming season.

The Panthers, unlike the Pittsburgh Pirates, ‘should win
at least three of their four games on the road. Victories will

Smooth orking Unit _

By JACK SMITH

The leaves are beginning to change at Ellsworth Field,
and Coach Leo Bemis’ soccer team is also changing -— from
just an 11-man team to one smooth working unit.

Bemis explains it as, “A team effort on the part of all.
The overall spirit seems very good and the squad seems to
be rounding into shape.” ’

The. booters’ first intrasquadé
game was held last weekend". Al-
though. the offense has improved.-
over last year thereis some ques-
tion as to just how strong the
Panthers will be defensively.

With. the _loss of Bill. Eisinger,
center fullback, and Ron Goga,
goalie, through graduation, Be-
mis. will be looking for someone
to fill those spots.

George Zanicopoulos seems to
have the edge on the goalie spot.
Zanicopoulos, a converted left
wing, was switched last winter
when’ he showed promise in the
North-South game held in St.
Petersburg. l ~ ‘
All Spots Open‘

Peter Karavellas and: Kal Smith
seem to have the edge» on the
vacant fullback slot. although at
this early date nothing is defin-
ate-. “All: spots are still. open,’
Bemis said.

Lettermen, however, seem to be
taking charge of all? other posi-
tions. “We do expect help from
our Sophomores,” said Bemis..
“Don Jerich, .a forward, and}
Steve Daniels a halfback have
been pushing some of our letter--
men.” -

Bemis was the return of Simon
Pestich and‘: Bob Long. Both
varsity lettermen in their soph-
omore year, they had to miss
competition last season. With
the help of these two. boys Be-
mis could have the bench help
he has lacked‘. so- often in the
past.
Wyatt Counted On
Of course Bemis will be count-
ing on Ron Wyatt, whopwas nam-
ed to last year’s all-American

lenses which should help im-
prove his head game, an area
lacking in last season’s play.

‘Over the next two weeks Bemis
will be "running his boys through
drills and holding intrasquad
games in preparation for the Soc-
cer opener on Sept. 30 with Slip-
pery Rock.

“Corky Cuthbert, along with sev-
eral others who were high school:
