Populist candidate makes run for White House

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer if

When the electorate enters vot-
ing booths on Nov. 8 in Pennsyl-
vania, it will be faced with

popular parties and the Populist

Party.
Populist Party candidate David
Duke is a former Democrat from

Louisiana who lost twice in at-_
tempting to be a member of that

state's senate. As he ran for that
office in the mid-70s, Duke was
the head of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan.

When he was a student at Loui-
siana State University, Duke
presented himself at a speech by
civil rights attorney William
Kunstler wearing a swastika and
a Nazi-brown shirt, according to
John Turner, author of Ku Klux
Klan, A History of Racism an
Violence. ~

, Duke is also quoted as saying,
”We are the modern warriors of
the white race, and we are ready
to purge the alien scum that
covers the top of America's ’me|t~
ing pot.’ ”

Referring to Duke, Turner said,
”Although he publicly preaches
nonviolence, his rhetoric in Klan
meetings is similar to that of other
Klansmen, and he himself was ar-
rested on charges of inciting to
riot in 1978.’_' A

According to Turner, Duke left
the Klan overla dispute with
another Klan leader.

Duke is presently not a mem-
berlof the Klan and despite his

past, Don Wassall, chairman of,

the Populist Party in Pennsylva-
nia, said that his party is anti-
racist and does not promote
white supremacy. -

”He quit the Klan because he
realized it was silly,” said

1/

This party hopes to fight
feminist groups and big banks, to
name a few, in order to put the
government into.the hands of the
people, said Wassall.

Wassall explained that the way
to end what he sees as minority
rule is to do away with affirma-
tive action programs, quotas and
forced racial busing. He believes
these practices inflate reverse dis-
crimination and are contrary to

He quit the Klan because he realized it was

silly.

— Don AWassaII

Wassall.

Duke was unavailable for com-
ment since he is presently tour-
ing the country.

The Populist Party's goal‘ is to
reinvigorate Thomas Jefferson's
principle of ”Equal rights for all;
special privileges for none,” ac-
cording to Wassall.

Wassall said that the majority
faction in the United States is not
being represented by the govern-
ment and that special interest
groups are receiving too much
representation.

”Democracy is majority rule,
and the values of the majority
should be reflected by the
government,” he said.

the spirit of the civil rights
movement.

”Discrimination is wrong
against blacks and whites,” he
said.

This dark-horse party sees this
country following a path which
will make it a Third World nation
somewhere in the foreseeable fu-
ture. It sees the nation falling from
grace culturally and econom-
ically.

Wassall said that Duke is na-
tionalistic and, if elected, hopes
to restrict immigration in order to
protect employment for ”Ameri-
can” workers.

He added, ”This nation is be-
coming non-white, and eventual-

ly whites will become the
minority. I
problem.”
When asked why he sees this
as a problem, he said that he feels

the majority of the people in this .

nation point to the current
governments in western Europe
and North America as being the
most successful rather than those
which presently exist in places
like Africa and South America.
Wassall said that it is despica-
ble that foreign nations, such as

Japan, are buying up large por-_

tions of U.S. land. He also point-
ed to mounting national debt as
being a catalyst in the destruction
of this country.

Wassall sees the Republican
and Democratic parties as being
ideally the same. He said they
have created atrend in moral
decline and a decline in personal
freedom. He added that if either
Vice President Bush or Gov.
Michael Dukakis is elected, these
trends will continue.

”What we need is some new
ideas,” he said. "Washington is
remote from the people. We
should promote as much local
control as possible throughout
the nation.”

The Populist Party has been
represented on voting ballots for
the past three years in Penn-
sylvania.

Z BT

accepted
as official
fraternity

By Suzanne Sabol
Staff Writer T

The Pitt chapter of Zeta Beta ‘

Tau will be nationally recognized

in a chartering ceremony this 

weekend at the Oakland Holiday
Inn.

At the formal ceremony this Fri-
day, the founding fathers of the
fraternity will be congratulated,
and the brothers will be present-
ed with a plaque that changes
their status from colony to true
fraternity. V

On Saturday, there will be a
ZBT alumni reunion. According
to brother Michael Neuman,
”this will be a chance to link our
past with the present. Also, the
alumni can see our progress.”

Two years ago, a new ZBT
chapter was formed by merging
the old ZBT, Phi Epsilon Pi and
Kappa Nu fraternities. As Neu-
man said, “When ZBT re-
colonized,rthere were a lot of ob-
stacles, due to the bad reputation
of the prior chapter. We made a

.commitment to make ZBT

respectable.”

According to founding father
Michael Pomerantz, the initial
problems were that the fraternity
”had trouble organizing and
[communicating]. We didn't even
have a house the first year.”

The fraternity, which started
with five founding members, has
grown in two years to a group of
49 brothers and 16 pledges, ac-
cording to Shawn’ Groff, ZBT
president. '

' An increase in membership is

one of the goals President Groff g

has set for the fraternity. He also
”wants toadd to a philanthropy

. something we can do every .

year for.ch.arity.”

ZBT also hopes to improve its
alumni relations after the ceremo-
ny and dinner this weekend.
Groff said, ”We’ve been updat-
ing our alumni lists. We want to
get them more involved.”

The alumni reception and the
chartering are ”a culmination of
a lot of hard work,” said ZBT
brother Sean Williams.

Neuman said, ”We’ve made
an impact on the Pitt campus and
the Pittsburgh community.”

Steven Browning was a mem-
ber of ZBT’s first pledge class. He
says that the fraternity has made
a personal impact as well.
”P|edging here was one of the
best things I've ever done.”

HARRISBURG (AP) ~ A
Democratic ”fact patrol” that in-
cluded two men who once
thought they would make a bet-
ter president than Michael
Dukakis said on Tuesday that
Republican nominee George
Bush failed in every mission he
was assigned by President
Reagan.

In a stop here, and at similar

events in Chicago, Buffalo and
Pittsburgh, five members of Con-
gress kicked off a last-ditch at-
tempt to show voters why they
think the Massachusetts governor
would make a better president
than the vice president.
, ”The choice between Dukakis
and Bush is one of the clearest
we've had,” said Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore, who sought the
Democratic nomination.

Even though most polls show
Bush with a comfortable lead in
electoral votes, Gore said he sees

Dukakis closing the gap and
poised for a dramatic victory next
Tuesday.

”These scurrilous attacks by the
Bush—Quayle Campaign had more
of an impact than people antici-
pated, but nowa backlash has be-
gun, and the momentum is
shifting,” Gore said during an af-
ternoon news conference.

Allegheny Co. judges

approved the mass registration on
Monday over the objections of
two lawyers from the Republican

About 5,000 people had been
notified by letter that they had

Testifying before the House
Education Committee, Jerry Shee-
han Davis of the Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance
Agency said students are select-

schools and depending more on
financial assistance to pay for

their burgeoning school bills.

More students from low-
income families are forgoing col-
lege altogether, he added.

”The downward trend is a real
one,” Davis said. ”And it is a very
troubling one because financial
aid programs are supposed to
help the most financially handi-
capped students gain access, and
one’s educational opportunities
in America should not be restrict-

homework for eight months.
But I did anyway.

At England's Durham Univer-

The professors naturally as-

becausethey want to learn.

Students are treated as adults,
and if I didn't attend a class, I was
not penalized by the professor.
Students wrote essays to ”prac—
tice” for the final exam questions.
They did not write them to meet
deadlines or gain extracredit.

In my literature class, I could
choose the critics I wanted to
read on the set texts instead of
reading assigned pages of a book.

In other words, I was responsi— -

ble for my own actions.

English education system helps student to like learning

Instead of cumulative grading,
my grades were determined by
one three—hour exam for each
course. This meant that nine
months of work would be
represented in one exam.

At first it was great. I could,
procrastinate when I wanted, al— L
ways saying, ”I’ve got plenty of
time!” I

No worries, no pressures and
no guilt.

Even though I attended my
classes, I also spent quite a bit of

time exploring the city or having
lengthy conversations in the pubs
with my new friends.

I also saw all of the movies,
concerts and English soap operas
that I wanted to without worrying
about cramming for an upcoming
exam.

But after a month of ”relaxing”
I realized I was bored.

Only then did I start to want to
go to class and learn. Without the
constant whirlwind of essay
deadlines and exam studying

which I experienced at Pitt, I ac-
tually had time to discover that
what I was learning was in-
teresting.

For instance, I didn't feel pres-
sured into studying the
playwright Arthur Miller's specif-
ic themes which the professor
discussed in lecture. I didn't run
to the library to check out the
suggested reading.

Instead, I scanned the library

THE PITT NEWS

Elway gets
his just
desserts
from Colts

0 Remember way back
when — 1983, I believe ——
when Stanford» quarterback
John Elway was a first—round
National Football League draft
pick of the now Indianapolis
Colts?

Remember how he refused
to sign with those same Colts,
saying he didn't want to play
for a losing team, which the
Colts were at that time?

So the Colts trade Elway to
the Denver Broncos, where he
goes on to become one of the
premiere quarterbacks in the
league.

MATT
MARTIN

What happened when the
Colts met the Broncos Mon-
day night? A 55-23
whitewashing of the Broncs.

Couldn't have happened to
a nicer guy. Anyone who turns
down a shot at playing in the
NFL because he does not want

to play for a downtrodden
franchise is an idiot.

0 Speaking of holdouts, All-
American forward Danny
Manning of Kansas, the first
player taken in the 1988 NBA
draft, has turned downan offer
from the Los Angeles Clippers
that would pay him $2 million
per year over five years.

He went on to say that he
wants every penny left under
the Clippers’ salary cap —
$1.5 million and then $2.02
million — and a 30 percent in-
crease over the next three
years before he will play-

To turn down an offer that
would make him the highest
paid forward in league histo-
ry, as well as one of the
highest paid rookies in histo-
ry, is ludicrous.

Let him sit out for the sea—
son. Los Angeles still has five
first-round draft picks from the
past two years. As good as
Manning is, no one should
have to put up with such a
”better than thou” attitude.

Pitt's kicking game improves with time

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

The Pitt kicking game has been
much maligned this season. They
have had to rely on two players
with limited experience to carry
the load: freshman Scott Kaplan
as place-kicker, and sophomore
Yusef Washington as the punter.

The trouble all started when
starting punter John Rasp quit the
team during fall workouts. This
left the Panthers with a big hole
on the team.

The coaches tried out every
viable candidate they could find
before settling on Washington.

Then Washington didn't pull

the load in the first game against.

Northern Iowa, averaging 27.3
yards per kick. The Panthers tried
Jeff Christy for the Ohio State
game, but he pulled the same
27.3—yard average. Then came
p|ace—kicker Jeff VanHorne, who
didn't last through the West Vir-
ginia game, and the job was back
in Wasington’s hands.

He has risen to the challenge.
Over the last five games,
Washington's punts have gotten
steadily stonger and higher. His
average has improved to 35.7
yards per punt. ~

”I "feel good right now,”
Washington said. ”I finally got
my drop down, and my tech-
nique has improved drastically. I
am really hitting the ball good
right now."

None of this is anything new to
Washington. While a student at
Duquesne High School, he was
a punter. But Washington is
quick to say that the college game
is much different.

”High School is a lot different,”
Washington said. ”Here you
have 11—man fronts, 10-man
fronts. There are a lot more peo-
ple coming after you. The pres-
sure is on, all eyes are on you.”

Having been thrust into the
punting job in the beginning,
Washington had a little trouble
adjusting, but nine weeks into the
season, he is doing better.

”The problem was that I didn't
have the time to put in as a punt-
er,” Washington said. ”Every—
body was getting time in practice

because the coaches were giving
everybody a chance. It was like,
just kicking the ball to get it
downfield. Techniquewise, I
wasn't doing what I was sup-
posed to do.

”Then, as time went on, I start-
ed developing my technique, and
that was when I started to get my
average up.”

Punting is not the only hat that
Washington wears for the Pan-
thers. He is also the back—up quar-
terback and has seen a lot of time

during practice at that position.
”I like quarterbacking better,
but I will do anything for the
team," Washington said. ”I don't
see a problem playing both posi-
tions. I played quarterback in the
Temple game and got a chance
against Navy. That is a confi-
dence builder, to be able to play
quarterback my first year
[Washington sat out the 1987
season due to academic require-
ments]. That really helps out.”
The Washington blood runs

deep on the Pitt team. Brother
Troy was Pitt's starting free safe-
ty before going down to an inju-
ry. He is still day-to—day.

”Troy is someone I really look
up to,” Washington said. ”He is
a leader on and off the field.”

But Yusef‘ is quick to dismiss
the idea that Troy, being a mem-
ber of the team, was a reason for
decidingon Pitt.

’’I guess he looked at it as he
made his decision, and he's go-

Football recruiting class key to Pitt success

By Matt Martin

Sports Editor

College recruitment of scholas-
tic football players began yester-
day, and Pitt coach Mike
Gottfried said this year's incom-
ing class will play a large role in
the continued success of his
team.

”This will be a very important
recruiting year for us because we
need to add a third part to this
particular class we have now,"
Gottfried said, referring to the
past two recruiting classes, both
rated in the top 10 in the country.

This month-long recruiting
period allows college coaches
and representatives to attend high
school games, visit the high
school coach and watch films
there.

By Dec. 1, athletes will be ac-
tively recruited with telephone
calls, campus visits andvisits by
the coaches to the desired play-

ers’ homes.

Gottfried said he plans to bring
in 21 to 23 players ”that can help
us make the next step where we
feel like we should be,” although
only 13 seniors will leave the
team.

Gottfried cited the defense as
the area most likely to be im-
proved through recruiting.

”There will be a smattering of
[recruiting at] every area, but
mostly at defense,” he said.

Other areas of concern are at
quarterback, the offensive line,
wide receiver and punter, accord-
ing to Gottfried.

In the past, incoming freshmen
have been nurtured until they are
ready to assume starting roles.
Gottfried sees a major change in
this philosophy, and a reason
why recruiting quality athletes
has become even more im-
portant.

”When you look around the
country, you see something you

didn't see several years ago -
freshmen are playing, not just at
the University of Pittsburgh, but
playing at a lot of places.

”The Penn State team that won
the national championship
[1986] was a very senior-

. dominated team. This football

team at West Virginia is dominat-
ed by seniors. Once you get into
the program, you've got to get
your numbers right. Each class

Q‘.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November 2, I988

Wilson near agreement;

PITTSBURGH (AP) —— Pitts-
burgh Pirates outfielder Glenn
Wilson said he is close to agree-
ing on a two—year contract and
may allow Friday’s free-agent fil-
ing deadline to pass.

. Outfielder Andy Van Slyke,

who isn’t eligible for free agency
until a year from now, said he has
received a ”fair” contract offer
but wants to negotiate a signifi-
cantly better deal.

Many major Ieaguers are being
asked to sign clauses under
which they won't be paid if the
owners lock them out. Club own-
ers, fearful of a long and poten-
tially season—disrupting strike,
reportedly may not open 1990
spring training camps if a new
basic agreement is not reached
with the Players’ Association.

’’I'm looking at everything very
positively,” Wilson said. ’’I don't
anticipate a strike or a- lockout.
But if we go on strike, I don't ex-
pect to get paid. If they lock us
out, I don't expect to get paid.

‘Van Slyke wants more

That's the American way.”

Wilson, who made $850,000
last season, is expected to take a
cut to about $700,000 a year.

Van Slyke, who earned
$850,000 last season, wants to be
”up there where Tim Raines is,”
referring to the three-year, $6.3
million contract Raines recently
signed with the Montreal Expos.

President Carl Barger said Van
Slyke ”is a cornerstone of our or-
ganization and [we] would like to
have him under a |ong—term con-
tract,” but he is not yet a $2
million-a—year player.

”I would hope the Pirates feel
that I am as important to them as
Raines is to Montreal,” said Van
Slyke, who had 25 home runs,
100 RBI, 30 stolen bases and a
league-leading 15 triples last
season. '

’’I think we can work this [con-
tract] out easily,” Van Slyke said.
”If we can't then I'll go to arbitra-
tion, sign for one year and then,
sayonara, I’ll try free agency [in
1990]."

Doughty at the top of the list
in Pirates’ search for new GM

PITTSBURGH (AP) —— The
Pittsburgh Pirates reportedly
may name a successor to oust-
ed general manager Syd Thrift
as early as next week, with in-
terim chief Larry Doughty con-
sidered the front—runner.

Pirates President Carl Barg-
er and board chairman Doug-
las Danforth plan to interview
one or two more candidates
this week, including former
New York Mets farm director
Steve Schrvver.

”We’re fairly well advanced
in our thought process,” Barg-
er said.

Among those interviewed
was Bill Bergesch, the Cincin-
nati Reds general manager
when Doughty was the team's
scouting director. Doughty
resigned in September 1987
because of budget cutbacks,
and Bergesch was fired by the
Reds and replaced by Murray
Cook a month later.

Schryver, who resigned last

Friday as the Mets director of
minor league operations, also
has been mentioned as a pos-
sible Pirates assistant general
manager should Doughty be
hired.

Schryver worked for the
Mets for eight years after
spending five seasons as the
Seattle Mariners assistant
director of minor leagues and
scouting.

Penn State in danger of losing seaso

By David S. Martin‘

Associated Press Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — Penn
State losses in the past have been
as rare as empty seats at home
games, but the Nittany Lions
have dropped three in a row and
are in danger of experiencing
their first losing season in 50
years. .

”Certainly we have not played
as well as I think we can play, but
I don’tthink I've coached as well
as I can coach,” Paterno said on
Tuesday.

inexperience/and iniuries have

combined this year to hurt Penn
State, 4-4, and Paterno and fans
alike have pinned their hopes on
developing a strong group of
freshmen and sophomores for the
future.

Penn State, upset by Rutgers
early in the season, has lost in
consecutive weeks to No. 16

Syracuse (24-10), No. 18 Alaba-

ma (8-3) and No.4 West Virginia
(51-30). J

”I really think we're close to
being a good football team. I just
want to try to make sure we don't
panic and get out of whack,”
Paterno said at his weekly news

conference.

Paterno said he wasn't sure if
such Eastern schools as Syracuse
and West Virginia had perma-
nently closed the talent gap with
Penn State. '

”Whether any team in the East
is going to dominate the way we
dominated for while there is very
debatable. Looking at it from my
end of it, I would hope we could
get back to where we could
dominate some things,” he said.

The Nittany Lions finish their
season with games against:
Maryland, Pitt and No. 1 Notre
Dame, raising the specter of the

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November 2, I988

first losing season since 1938.
Their 49-year string of non-losing
seasons is an NCAA record.

Paterno, who has won 80 per-
cent of his games in 23 seasons,
said he doesn't care about the
streak.

Instead, he has invested in

youth as never before and says he I

wants improvement from his
team. 3

Among the youngsters playing
for Paterno is Tony Sacca, the first
true freshman to start at quarter-
back in Paterno’s 23 years as
head coach.

numbers so that you get  what
you need to recruit,” Gottfried
said.

Gottfried went on to say that
Pitt can compete with any team
in the country when it comes to
recruiting.

”We feel like we have a lot to
offer here. Facilitywise we're
ga_ining. Nationally, we feel like
we can offer everything, offer a
great tradition academically and
also athletically.

”We will recruit nationally like
we did last year. We pulled Cur-
vin Richards out of Houston, and
we pulled Baron Jackson out of
Baton Rouge, La.," Gottfried
commented.

n Recruiting  

®‘~

Richards leads the team with A

730 yards rushing and six touch-

" downs, while Jackson is one of

the top young receivers on the

club.

Pitt’s location in Western Penn-
sylvania, one of the hotbeds for
college recruiters, gives the Pan-
thers an added advantage over
other schools recruiting in the
same area. ’

’’We feel that it is a good year
in Pennsylvania, that it's a good

year in the East, primarily where

we recruit.

”Western Pennsylvania is a
very fertile area,” Gottfried said.
”There are 12 to 15 players in
Western [Pennsylvania] that
we’re looking at.”

Another area that Gottfried has
had great success with is the state
of New Jersey. Fifteen of Pitt's
players hail from the Garden
State, while 53 reside in Penn-
sylvania.

Coincidentally, Pitt plays Rut-
gers, dubbed ”New Jersey's
team,” this Saturday at Pitt Stadi-
um in the Panthers’ final home
contest of the season.

Pitt's other kicker, Kaplan, was
in similar circumstances.

Coming out of fall drills, Van-
Horne had won the job. Then he
went down with a groin injury
and the p|ace—kicking duties were
Handed to Kaplan. He has been
the starter since the West Virginia

’’I was hoping to see this much

Jeff won the job, I thought that I
would be red-shirted.”

Kaplan has made five of seven
field goals so far, his longest com-
ing on a 44-yard attempt against
Boston College. Yet, the fresh-
man from Coral Springs, Fla.,
doesn't feel much pressure.

”Peop|e built up the West Vir-

Kaplan will also handle the
kickoff duties against Rutgers and
said this is a little different.

”You have more time to con-
centrate, but there are a few vari-
ables,” Kaplan said. ”First of all,
you are running a little faster on
the kickoff. Secondly, you've got
guys on the team running emo-
tionally. When they are faster
than me, which most of the guys
are, they can run on your heels.
You just have to work through
that.”

The Pitt kickers have had to
work through a lot this season,
but they seem to be coming
through it in the end.

Sacca has completed 52 of 137
passes, a 38 percent completion
rate, with four touchdowns and
five interceptions.

’’I think Sacca’s done a magnifi-
cent job under all the conditions
that have been very, very. ad-
verse,” Paterno said.

Partly as a result of Paterno
relying on his underclassmen,
Penn State has committed some
uncharacteristic blunders:

— Against Syracuse, Penn
State's offensive line was called
for illegal procedure six times.

— Against Alabama, Penn State
had a touchdown called back for
holding, and blockers failed to
pick up blitzing linebacker Der-
rick Thomas. He had three sacks,
one of them for a s_afety.

—- Against West Virginia, Penn
State was whistled for having 12
men on the field in the first half,
and later, freshman Chris Cisar
called a fair catch on the 7-yard
line.

Paterno’s youth movement
hasn't been entirely by choice.

Third—team All-America tail-
back Blair Thomas, a senior, will
miss the entire season with a
knee injury suffered before the
Citrus Bowl last year. Thomas led
Penn State last year with 1,414
yards rushing, the third best total
in the university's history.

Sophomores Leroy Thompson
and Gary Brown and senior Sean
Redman have alternated in Tho-
mas’ place. They have combined
for 965 yards on 202 carries.

Junior quarterback Tom Bill
started the first three games of the
season, but dislocated his
kneecaplate in the third quarter
of the Rutgers game. He also is
expected to miss Saturday's game
against Maryland.

Fans in an area of central Penn-

sylvania dubbed ”Happy Valley” .

don't appear perturbed by the
mediocre season.

”Penn State fans are very spe-
cial people. They love the teams.

When you love somebody, you
know there are going to be good
times and bad times,” said Dean
McKnight, vice president of the
Quarterback Club and a 1970
graduate.

Penn State's ticket sales have
never been affected by the team's
misfortunes, selling out 66 con-
secutive games 1978.

And callers to a weekly radio
show Monday night appeared
more concerned with the be-
havior of the West Virginia fans _
than their team's fortunes. Penn I
State's game with West Virginia
was stopped with 49 seconds to
play when fans charged onto the
field.

At least one alumnus isn't hap-
py about what the end of the
streak of successful seasons
represents. V

”It’s the end of civilization as
we know it. The barbarians are at
the gates,” said Dick Jones, a
public relations consultant and as
member of the Class of 1970.
