Faculty Approves F
Withdrawal Option

By BRIAN BALK

A motion that will revise the with-
drawal grade option was passed at
yesterday’s Faculty of Arts and
Sciences (FAS) monthly meeting.

The motion, which was approved
unanimously, will permit students to
withdraw from course's only in exte-
nuating circumstances after a ni_ne-
week period.

The present withdrawal policy
allows the student to withdraw from

' g a course with the professor’s permis-

sion at any time during the semester.

According to Irwin Schulman,
dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences, the number of late with-
drawals has risen steadily in the last
few years.

“We had no means of verifying
and turning back the tides of this
trend,” Schulman said. “The largest
portion of reasons for withdrawing
were intended not to be extenuating
circumstances." .

The majority of the reasons listed
stemmed from the course’s being too
difficult to not have enough time to
fulfill the requirements.

. ‘‘In effect, you’ll have an‘«A~BC-W’
“system,” Schul-man -said. Too many
students are bailing out if they see
they are going to receive allow grade,
he said. » L .

Schulman maintained that he
intends to be" “fairly hard-nosed
about this.”

Schulman examined the present

“W” grade option and discovered
that most students only withdrew
from one course rather than their
entire schedule. In most of the 855
cases of late withdrawals, only ‘one
course was affected—it was dispro-
portionate to the outcome, he said.
Several FAS members discussed
problems that could erupt _with the
advent of a new “W” system. Prob-
lems such as, since the College of
General Studies (CGS) will not
abide by the same guidelines, what.
will happen to students in CAS that
cross list into a CGS course.
Schulman said that the same
problem can occur with undergrad-
uates registered in graduate courses.
The new “W” grade option will
not go into effect until the Regis-
trar’s Office develops a new “W”
option mechanism. But, according
to Schulman, it should not take long
because the registrar is presently in
the process of developing a_new
computer grade system. ' -
A The motion was passed with the
stipulation that the CAS Council
additionally look into the audit
option. . . . j
‘The FAS Faculty also unanim-
ously approved Schulman’s pro-

‘, posed CAS-Engineering program. ,
The five-year program requires that ._ .  

students take a minimum of 70 engi-
neering and 90 CAS credits to earn
the dual degree. ‘

cient but to keep the faculty we
want, this salary increase resolution
is a necessary one,” Daehnick said.

According to Daehnick, faculty
raises have failed to keep up with
inﬂation, and the purchasing power
of faculty salaries has decreased by
20 percent.

The university, said Daehnick, is
becoming more of a private indus-
try; A certain amount of money is
necessary to run an institute the size
of a university, and the State con-
tinues to lower its funding to Pitt.

“The State used to pay one-third
of the university’s costs, now they
pay less than 30 percent; in a private
institute, all costs are covered by tui-
tion. Pitt is already at a point where
tuition is an appreciable part of the
budget. Another third of the univer-
sity’s costs come from researchand
grants,” Daehnick said.

_ An amendment to the salary
increase resolution would enable an
increase in the amount given to

logic and force ofits own accord-
ing to Todd Jailer, a member of
the Pittsburgh Peace Group
Mobilization for Survival.
Jailer spoke on “Politics and
the Arms Race” at yesterday’s
weekly meeting of the Pitt Arms
Race Study Group. The group
meets to discuss and report on all
aspects of the arms race-
“Nuclear weapons are being
developed not to fulfill any real
need in society but to fulfill their
own technological possibilities,”
Jailer said. He used British social
historian E.P. Thompson’s met-
aphor to describe the arms race;
it is like heroin addiction——the
people in the Pentagon and the
Kremlin are just asking for
another fix, Jailer said.
According to Jailer, Thomp-
son’s solution to the arms race is
a “third path” between the super
powers. This third path is real-
ized in a concept like a United
States of Europe, but is actually
more of a unification of Euro-
pean countries so that they can
use their increased leverage to
dealing with the super powers.
The arms race, Jailer admit-
ted, cannot end until the Cold
War——-two systems engaged in
constant opposition—is ended. .
Jailer cited Thompson’s posi-
tion of exterminism beyond
nuclear weapons as it is also
shared by the Greens, an alterna-
tive German political party.

visible and apparent symptom of
industrialism, according to
Jailer. Others share his view.
The Greens see the alienation
of people as basically a parallel
effect of nuclear weapons build-
up and as a result of industrial-
ism “gone cra_zy,”Ja‘iler said. The
Greens, who define this indus-
trialism as 20th centruy capital-
ism, group the Soviet Union and
the U.S. in the same category,
Jailer said, because both have
expansionist systems.
Themotive for accumulation
and constant growth is at the
heart of the systems, and the
Greens see growth as economic
expansion, a fettish common to
the East and the West, he said.
“Their position on disarma-
ment is that it is really only part
and parcel fo restoring some sort
of ecological balance and achiev-
ing social justice in the world,”
Jailer said.
The question of disarmament

is more immediate to‘Europeans .

than it is "to Americans because
Europe fears its'territory may

 Schenley Han        
  Part   Of Pitt’s Past

_ *-
43$»
\ .

By MARY ANN KRUPA

There is little about Schenley Hall
‘today to suggest that it was once a
ﬂourishing haven for the idle rich
and “the only place in town to get
fresh caviar,” but that is what the
place represented to another genera-

.tion of Pittsburghers in itstdays at
the turn of the century.

I The down-at-the-heels old ediﬁce
that now groans under the strain of
its $10 million renovation construc-
tion was, in its time, a hotel of such
palatial distinction that it inspired
Willa Cather to describe it in a short
story as, “a warm, "lighted building,

an exotic, tropical world of shiny‘

surfaces and basking ease.”
The rooms and hallways that are

now choked with ply-wood and»

building materials once sheltered a
glitterihg parade of guests that
included presidents. movie and
opera stars, politicians, gangsters
and famous athletes of the period.
Anyone with a claim to power, noto-
riety or wealth congregated at the
Schenley Hotel in the years between
1898 and 1954. But the hotel actually

'1-‘jg-,\ reached its‘ pinnacle of magnificence



ﬂuring its first 30 years, before

_ depression and war took their toll on

the opulent life styles of the nation’s
elite.

A quest book that was unearthed
during the spring of l956,just before
the hotel was sold to the university,
and closed forever, revealed the
ghosts of some of the glamorous
people who registered at the Schen-
ley in I908. ,

On April 6, H.S. Firestone, the
rubber tire tycoon, checked _in at the
Schenley Hotel for a vacation from
what was then just a growing busi-
ness. Only 40 years old at the time,
he was to become the multi-

‘ millionaire chairman of the board

for one of the world’s largest rubber
companies before his death 30 years

later. He vacationed often with
friends Henry Ford and Thomas
Edison. -

The original and eternal Peter
Pan, actress Maude Adams,.regis-
tered at the. hotel on April .13.
Adams was described as the mystery
woman of her era, never allowing
herself. to be photographed during
her entire career, and never once in
20 years talking with a reporter.
Adamsretired from the stage nine
years after-her stay at the Schenley,
maintaining her World War 1 style
of dress for the rest of her life.

In May, the most idolized ‘opera
singer on the day, the great Enrico
Caruso, stayed at the hotel just three
years after taking Pittsburgh by
storm in his debut in the city.

Four years before his election to
the presidency of the United States,
Woodrow Wilson checked in as the
president of Princeton University.

One of the most legendary of the
hotel’s guests, A.P. Moore, was reg-
istered for June 4, just four years

beforehe rocked the city of Pitts--

burgh by marrying the even more
legendary singer, Lillian Russell.
Moore and Russell together made

one of the countrv’s most ﬂam-
boyant couples. Moore was the

” internationally famous Pittsburgh

newspaperman who was later to
become“U.S. Ambassador to Spain,
Russell the foremost popular singer
of her era. Their wedding, held in the
French suite of the old hotel, was
one of the most talked-about social
events of the period.

Theodore Roosevelt and Charles
Evans Hughes were guests of the
hotel at one time, and President Wil-
liam Howard Taft once wrapped a
napkinaround his hand to prevent
injury from pounding his fist‘ on a
table during a speech in the
ballroom.

Eleanora Duse, the great Italian.
tragedian, died in the Schenley
Hotel on April 24;’ 1924, in a corner

suite on the fifth floor. She had con-

tracted pneumonia while looking for

the stage entrance to» the Syria 3
.‘Mosque in a rain storm. A plaque 
honoring her was placed in Schenley 

Hall in 1954. _
“Diamond Jim” Brady was a fre

quent guest at the Schenley and

flashed his costly sparklers under the

crystal chandeliers of the luxurious, -

mirrored ballroom.
In an interview for Pittsburgh

‘Magazine in .1974, historian James *
"Van Trump said of the old Schenley

 

“It was an important place,
socially. It also had a certain cachet.
A certain distinction, you know. It
was comfortable and cozy- and
above all, it was a glamorous place.
Magnificent.”

Van Trump said that the Schenley
was an imitation of the Plaza Hotel
in New York, and at that time in
Pittsburgh's history, a great palace
hotel was needed with what he called
“much French, much marble and
much plush.”

In the late 1900s, there was practi-
cally nothing in the area besides the
Carnegie Institute, according to Van
Trump, before architect Franklin
Nicola decided to build a palace-
style hots] as a cornerstone for a
civic center in Oakland. E

The property where the Schenley
stands was once a cow pasture
owned by the late Mary Crogan
Schenley. Allof the cultural activity
at the time was centered in the
Market Square district of down-
town, and Nicola wanted to develop
the Oakland district as part of the
civic center plan.‘

To realize his dream, Nicola
formed the Bellefield Corporation
with H.C. Frick, Andrew Carnegie,
George Westinghouse and H..I.
Heinz among the original 56
stockholders.

“Nicola bought the Schenley est-
ate and laid out a new district, just
like that," Van Trump said. “So
Pittsburgh had it—great palace
hotel. The great American pheno-

Hotel, from a cow pasture where the Chemistry Building
now stands. '

menon. And it brought the people to
Oakland. They came because of the

~— fine foods, the luxury and the glam-

our. Eventually, everything just
grew up around it.

“But that was a long time ago. The
Schenley will never be for me what it
once was. Once the university took
over, that was the end.”

In 1954, the hotel changed its
name to the Schenley Park Hotel
and it became an “up-to-date hotel
for transients.” The marble floors of
the lobby were covered with red car-

-peting and 25 more guest rooms

were added by carving up the large
corner suites. The lobby was made
into a cocktail lounge and men’s bar.
The section where.Enrico Caruso
once rented an entire wing for his
troupe was remodeled into smaller
rooms and the Continental dining
room was redecorated.

In. 1956, the Schenley Park Hotel
was sold to the university for over
$1.5 million to be used as the student
union bulding, housing the mathe-
matics department and student pub-
lications in addition to the snack bar

downstairs.

Today, according to architectural

plans by Williams, Trebilcock and
Whitehead, the building is being
extensively changed to make larger
spaces for the student publications
and other offices in the building. The
greatest changes are being made in
the basement and upper floors, and
the character of the main floor will
be the same with its grand ballroom,
white marble lounge and famous
stairway to nowhere. The grand bal-
lroom will receive a multi-color
repainting in tune with its beauz-arts
period, and the stairs to the present
columned porch will be taken away
but the porch will stay. It will be
lined with balusters like the originals
that were once there.

A new entrance featuring a neo-
classic broken pediment and bowed

windows will be placed at ground

level on the Forbes side.

In the southeast corner of the old
hotel, the architects have wisely and
fortunately retained Lillian Russell's
fourth floor suite and the mahogany
paneled area.

Work began ‘on the hall in
December of 1981 and is expected to
be completed by September.

Dr. Richard Cottam, a Pitt
political science professor, said

the Faculty of Arts and Sciences v

(FAS) bargains “extremely
badly," it doesn't think in terms
of bargaining and is inclined to
accept economic cuts as they are
handed out.

Cottam has been -a staunch

. opponent to the proposed cuts

announced at the last FAS
meeting. r
Initially, Cottam said, Pitt is

’ confronted with a situation

about which it can do nothing-—
resource reduction. With the end
of the growth period Pitt has
experiencedin the past, the ques-
tion at hand, he said, is simply
what the core and priorities of a
university are. '

Cottam described the actual

‘ growth period as affecting only

marginal areas of the university.
Now that the need for cutbacks is
inevitable, they are being made
across the board. And Cottam
said that the cutbacks include
what he regards as the “core area
of the university—FAS.”

He said that there is a feeling
among the faculty that the cut-
backs are being applied “...in a
very managerial style, across the

board and without the in-depth ‘

debate and concern the issue
deserves.” For example, a typical
management decision might be
to Vmake cuts in a department

with low undergraduate enroll-
ment, such as the history
department.

In the case of the history
department, Cottam stressed
that “a university with aspira-
tions to greatness must haveran
excellent history department
with its own integrity, even if
undergraduate enrollment dic-
tates otherwise.”

In such a case, as with all FAS
reductions, Cottam said, cuts
should be based on the issue of
educational-philosophical con-
cerns, and the reductions pres-
ently being made are based from
a managerial reference point.

The administrative “_manage-
rial” aspect of the FAS reduc-
tions has been an entirely
different issue in itself. Recently,
FAS dean Jerome . Rosenberg
independently set up a‘ commit-
tee to look into the issue of FAS
cuts. Cottam questioned the mis-
sion, purpose and instructions of
the ad hoc committee.

After being told the names of
the faculty members, Cottam
said they were the right people,
but he still was concerned about
the committee findings.

John Roberts, professor of
anthropology and a member of
Rosenberg’s advisory committee
described the group as strictly
advisory. He said the committee
had no standing, made no deci-
sions and essentially “reviewed
the possibilities with Rosen-
berg.”

Prioritiesouestioned In Cuts

~”f‘“>By ANN O'CONNOR

Roberts emphasized that the
advisory committee was made up
of people “on their way out,"and
so he believed Rosenberg had
sufficiently attempted to con-

struct an objective advisory
board.
Essentially, Roberts said,

Rosenberg was merely asking for
help in constructing a counter-
proposal to Senior Vice-
Chancellor Jack Freeman's
reduction outline. Later the
faculty would have the oppor-
tunity to argue the issue. At the
state of the ad hoc committee,
however, the panel’s purpose was
to discuss whether there was evi-
dent bias in the proposal,
whether reduction procedures
were fair and if the standards for
the cuts were too political.
“Most of us [FAS members]
think that Freeman is one of the
most competent people around
here and that his recommenda-
tions are defensible from his
frame of reference," Cottam
said. “Unfortunately, it’s the rest

—of us who don't challenge his

decisions who do him a

disservice.”

The issue of FAS reductions
basically focuses on the inability
of the faculty to bargain effec-
tively and thereby impact on
reduction distributions, Cottam
said. Until the FAS formulates
some sort of bargaining process,
Cottam warned, there will be lit-
tle, if any, resistance to cuts.

 Opinion

Oh, The
Indignityl

Schenley Hall will soon disappear from Pitt’s
campus. That venerable orange building—once a
swank Oakland hotel overlooking Forbes
Field—is slated to become the Pitt Union.

Of all the indignities. For a year now, Schenley
Hall has been tortured by renovation teams; its
once charming personality has been torn out,
only to be replaced by unwashable pastel walls
and stark metal cubicles. And now, to add insult

 to injury, Pitt will strip Schenley Hall of its name.

Before “Pitt Union” is added to the growing list

i of prestigious names on campus—including

. monickers like “Old Engineering Hall,”“Chemis-

try Building,” and “Annex”—Pitt should con-
sider some of the possible side effects.

There are several hundred student organiza-
tions and a dozen or so administrative offices
housed in Schenley Hall. The university has gen-
erously given most of these offices their own sta-
tionery, which includes their address——Schenley
Hall. When Schenley Hall becomes the Pitt
Union, Pitt will face an enormous bill for new
stationery printing. Of course, after patiently
bouncing from ﬂoor to floor to accomodate the
' renovation teams, these organizations will learn
with pleasant surprise that they can now change
their addresses without actually moving.

Of course, this is the 1980s, and nobody

remembers the past any more. The past is passed.
No one remembers that just about 30 years ago,
as the Korean conflict was coming to a close and
the government was lifting restrictions on new
buildings, Pitt considered constructing a new
home for its many student organizations. One
.plan was to erect a new structure on the lawn
between the Cathedral of Learning and Heinz
Chapel (which, by the way, might be renamed
“Little Grey Church”).

Then, as the history books tell us, Pitt decided
to buy the Schenley Hotel, instead. For the next
30 years the name “Schenley Hall” served to
remind passersby of that building’s proud past. In
the years to come, the unbecoming title “Pitt
Union” will evoke thoughts of the AFL-CIO.

Letters To I The Editor

An Important Distinction

Dear Editor:

The Pitt News is not the only pub-
lication to miscontrue an important
fact in the story of the closing of the
department of geography.

The special Senate Committee,
which I chaired, to review the
PRMS document proposing termi-
nation did not recommend “keeping
the geography department open.”
What it did say was that the case for

closing it was not sufficient. The dis-
tinction is important.

The Senate Committee was
strongly convinced that any action
as severe as departmental termina-
tion requires substantive justifica-
tion, including a discussion of
alternatives and their impact.

We did not find that kind of
thorough-going analysis in the
PRMS document. The_closing of a
department should not be viewed in
narrow terms. It entails more than
cost savings.

If any such action should be taken
in the future, it should be done on
the grounds that the assets and lia-
bilities to the affected responsibility
center or division and to the univer-
sity have been very thoroughly

assessed. The academic justification ‘

of such action is as important as the
financial.

Dear Editor:

I am an alumnus of Pitt (Nursing
’73 and Graduate School Nursing
'77). I was disturbed at a recent arti-

Dear Editor:

I was most upset at the cartoon in
The Pitt News on Monday, March
I4, picturing a judge speaking to
Dave Puzzuoli as if he were already
tried and found guilty. The preceed-
ing articles in your newspaper also
gave that impression to the reader.

I cannot believe that your car-
toonist did not know that a person is
innocent until proven guilty. Also, if
you had really been interested in

investigating this all-edged charge, ‘

you would have found 15 witnesses
who disagree with the police version
of this story and will appear in Puzz-
uoli’s behalf at the trial.

There are doctors who will testify
that there was absolutely nothing
medically wrong with the policewo-
man involved. Instead of condemn-
ing him now, why don't you wait
until the outcome of his trial when
he is proven not guilty?

This paper's tone was a little dif-
ferent toward Dave Puzzuoli when
he ran 95 yards for a touchdown this
season. This is a Pitt newspaper talk-
ing about a Pitt

“Welcome to The People's Court,” the
.announcer said, “where not only justice, but
valuable prizes, is handed out. Today Judge
Nielsen will be presiding over two cases; one

' about a coffee-stained couch, and the other,

p,.

the first one on the agenda, “The Case of the
Continuing Questioner!” ‘

Theaudience roared with approval and
applause signs ﬂashed overhead as the plain-
tiff, Charlette, walked onstage. When the
sign turned to “Hiss,” they responded ea-
gerly, booing Socrates, wearing his toga, as
he walked into the courtroom.

“Charlette,” the judge said, “tell us your
story.”

“Hi Mom! Hi Dad!” she said excitedly.
The judge frowned.

“Well,” she began, “I work at the Bell
Information Center. Every day, I answer
peoples’ questions on how to find things in
the Yellow Pages. This weirdo called me up
and asked me to inform him on what justice
was. He wouldn’t hang up and kept asking

me all types of questions. I turned to the girl
next to me and complained what a nuisance.
he was;.she said.if «I could prove that here, I
could win valuable prizes. So here I am!”

“That you do, Charlette,“ the -announcer
butted in as theme music started. “Today, if
you win a case, you win a brand new car!
[The audience cheered] and a case of Turtle
Wax. But first let’s here from that nuisance
himself, Socrates.” A

“Before answering the charge," Socrates
began, “the reason for the charge must be
examined. Is this person, or anyone else who
comes here, really concerned with justice?
Or are they concerned with TV exposure and
your valuable prizes? Are you, judge, more
concerned with ratings than with the harm
your show does to the public’s conception of
how justice really works?”

“Just answer the charge!” snapped the
jud e, to the audience's approval. Pleased
with the response, he smiled into the camera
with that fatherly smile of his.

“The charge!” Socrates exclaimed. “Since

when is asking questions a chargeable

offense?”
“This is the 20th century,” sorneone

yelled. “You don’t ask questions, you just
‘accept! Next thing he’ll want us to protest or

- something,” the man continued, much to the"

audience‘s approval.

“That concludes the defendant’s testi-

. mony," the announcer said hastily. “The

judge will now return to his chambers to
decide on a winner, while we watch a mes-

‘ sage from our-sponsors."

The judge sat in his wood-paneled office
and looked at his shelves of books. Reaching
for the one marked “Public Nuisance
Cases,” he looked through the pages. A
trend began to emerge, it seems; when a
defendant had been found guilty, the show
rose 10 points in the ratings, a verdict of
innocent meant a drop of five. After careful
consideration, the judge made up his mind
and headed back into the “courtroom.”

“And now here's your judge, Judge
Nielsenll” the announcer screamed over the
audience’s cheers.

“It is the decision of this court after careful
study of the facts that you, Socrates, are
guilty of being a nuisance.”

The crowd jumped out of its seats as Char-
lette broke down in cheers.

“And that means,” the announcer butted
in, “that Charlette wins the valuable prizes.
First, there’s the new car!"

Charlette screamed joyfully.

“And a year's supply of Turtle Wax!”

Charlette passed out in ecstacy.

“For the loser, we have a case of the new
men’s cologne, Hemlock. That's the end of
the first case; stay tuned because after these

  Socrates Gives HisFinal Farewell

messages, we’ll be back with the “Case of the
‘Coffee-Stained Couch.”

During the break, as Charlette was carried
from the courtroom, the announcer walked
over to Socrates. “Here, you can go now.”

“Go? But I was found guilty, aren't I sup-
pose to be punished? I don't deserve it, but I
did agree to play by the game's rules. So give
medwhat I've got coming to me!" Socrates
sat . .

“I gave it to you all ready, the Hemlock!

The cologne that knocks ’em dead!”
“What am I suppose to do with it?"
“Drink it! What do I care?”

“All right,” Socrates said, drinking down
one of the bottle’s contents. As he drank the
last drop, the bottle slipped from his hands
and shattered on the ground. A smoke cloud
slowly formed around his feet and spiraled
upward, eventually covering his whole body.
After completely covering Socrates from
view, the cloud began to dissipate. As it did,
an empty sheet fell to the ground. Socrates
was gone.

The announcer walked over and picked
up the vacated toga, tossing it into the trash.
“Being just was hard work,” he thought.
“Now for the Case of the Coffee-Stained
Couch.”

2 I332 JOHN TRHENTES 

It was late in the afternoon. Rush hour
was just beginning to get into full swing,
and the bus was packed as tightly as a

» bottle of Spanishlolives. I saw him wait-
ing atthe stop even before he got on.

He looked to be about 100 years old
with a Charles Lindbergh cap and a tat-

. tered trench coat. His grey whiskers had
not been disturbed from their bristly

what appeared to be the bulk of his
wordly possessions in a Giant Eagle bag,

“Hey, man. That’ll be one dollar,”
growled the driver. “You hear me?”

 

“Hack grunt snort gurgle cough,” re-
plied the man. “Harumph harumph wa
wa!”

He slowly reached into his pocket and
produced a crinkled, greasy dollar bill; he
fed it into the machine, which beeped in
its own form of gastric satisfaction. A line
of passengers glared at him from the
aisle.

“Gow grach,” he said to the people.’
“Grum grum hocch ptui!”

Some 30-odd faces of every possible

found myself in the unfortunate position
of having to extend my posterior region
into the scowling face of anioverweight,

pounds of cheap, oversized costume
jewelry.

“Sorry,” I muttered under my breath.
As he reached the back of the bus, he

woman, who stared at him with a mixture
of guilt and ‘pity on her face and piped up
with, “Oh you poor soul, here—you can
have my seat!”

“Ramgrugh gruphle bluch,” he replied
in gratitude as he plopped down in the
seat. “Burgle whuph whindcch."

The delicate odor of rotting garbage
up and piqued my nostril hairs.

For the longest time, he refused to do
much else besides grumble softly and
take an occasional swig from a brown
paper bag, the contents of which smelled
like it couldiprobably strip the paint job
off the U.S.S. Enterprise. ‘He finished
each long draught with a sigh and a fool-
ish grin. .

As the trip wore on, people began to

turn their attention away from him, turn-
ing instead to concentrate on their Wall
Street Journals and 12-inch-thick ro-
mance novels. As soon as the man saw
that he wasn’t being observed, he under-
went an odd metamorphosis: off came
the trench coat, revealing a neat brown
suit with a tie and button-down collar.
Off came the cap and the sparse white
“whiskers” that had really been pancake
makeup. Placing his horn-rimmed glases
squarely on the bridge of his nose, he
removed the. bottle of Coca—Cola from
the bag, crossed his legs and began read-
ing intently his copy of Scientiﬁc
American.

“Excuse me,” I‘ said, “but now you’ve
got me curious. When you got on the bus,
you looked like a creature, that crawled
out of my garbage disposal. Now you
look like a professor or something.”

“That’s because I am a professor,” he
enunciated ﬂawlessly. “Let’s see you get a
seat after five o'clock!”

The Great

Communicator

By DANA REED

According to our resident “Great Com-
municator,” Chancellor Wesley Posvar, tui-
tion will go up a minimum of 5 percent. Not
only does this come at a time when the
annual inﬂation rate is less ‘than four per-
cent, but it also comes in the face of some of
the most severe cutbacks in the history of the
University of Pittsburgh. .

Our Grand Poohba, Mr. Posvar, has
already brought us the closing of the geo-

graphy department, the closing of the

Women’s Center, the elimination of several
athletic teams and a host of other cutbacks
matched only by his idols in the Office of

Management and Budget. Now 01’ Wes has ‘

proposed the closing of the Internship Office
and the elimination of anywhere from 33 to
53 FAS faculty members. Add this to his
unﬂawed record of having raised tuition 12

of the past 13 years, a staggering 51 percent i

since 1978, and you have a good case for
impeachment. -

Yes Pitt students, we are getting the shaft.
?We’re getting it on the local level, the state
level and the federal level. lt’s time to put the
wagons in a circle and fightlike hell. Having
just returned from National Student Action
Day in Washington, D.C., I can say that
there are numerous students speaking out
and making a difference.

But first let us examine some of the pri-
mary contradictions here at Pitt. Ask your-
self, “Who makes the decision to raise
tuition?” Every May, the chancellor and his
corporate cronies on the Board of Trustees,
who represent the largest and most inﬂuen-
cial corporations in Pittsburgh, get together
and make the decisions affecting students.
Twelve of the past 13 years they have
brought us the gift of at tuition hike and
cutbacks. Do students have an input to this
decision? Well, tokenly they do. Students
have one representative on the Board of
Trustees, but what his capacity is, no one
really knows. In the past, they have always
been able to find a yes-man to agree with
anything they said. The aura of sitting with

the top bigwigs of the corporate world‘

would corrupt and incapacitate anyone, I
suppose, but thanks to a 25-year classiﬁed
secrecy ruling, we will never know what goes
on behind the doors of these meetings. Have
they something to hide?

Students must stand up and demand a
voice in the policies that directly affect them.
And I’m not just talking about evaluating
faculty members, either. Student input and
control of the university apparatus should
take precendent over being under the con-
trol of the top corporate heads of the city of
Pittsburgh. Needless to say, students are the
ones who pay the tuition and it is our,'and

:,| A \-cu: ( _. '

our parents’, tax dollars that fund the higher
educational programs.

A joint faculty-student administrative
control over the University of Pittsburgh

would guarantee that the priorities of educa- I

tion, and not money making adventures;
were assured. Posvar and his corporate
friends have done their best to turn Pitt into
a profit making corporation, rather thana
place of higher learning. They have sacri-
ficed the geography department and the
Women’s Center to assure that Pitt would
have a consulting firm for coal companies.
Where are our priorities?

Pitt students, in face of the worst eco-
nomic crises since the Depression and the
prospects of rising tuition and loss of ﬁnan-
cial aid, must rise to the challenge and over-
come their adversaries.

educational system that affects us. We must
encourage our student government repre-
sentatives to exert their power and inﬂuence

. to assure that there will be no more cuts in

departments or services. We must also
demand that the Board of Trustees freeze
tuition now, with no layoffs of faculty or
service workers.

It can be done. Last year, an intensive
student lobby that converged on Capitol
Hill was able to defeat the Reagan Adminis-
tration’s attack on higher education. With
the inspiration of those students who partici-
pated in the last two “National Student
Action Days,” let us create our own action in
Harrisburg and here at home at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. In doing so, we can put
Governor Thornburgh, Wes Posvar and the
Board of Trustees back in their box.

movements and society as a
whole.

Jailer said he sees disarma-
ment advocates in America
broken down into three different
constituencies that range from
liberal to conservative.

One group favors the freeze on
nuclear weapons. They see the
weapons as an aberration—a
tumor, Jailer explained. And

they see the problem as one that _

can be isolated—“system can be
saved by the system,” he said.

The second group, according
to Jailer, is made up of religious
concerns. Religious groups, he
explained, have a much broader
vision and critique of the
situation.

“They focus on the spiritual
damage the arms race has done,”
he said. '

Jailer, however, criticized the
group.

“They do not go far enough in
proposing solutions to the prob-
lem,” he said. He also warned
against the dangers of the devel-
opment of sectarian positions in
the anti-nuclear movements. The
third group is not at all homo-
geneous, according to Jailer, but
is ‘rooted in alternative, anti-
nuclear power kinds of
movements. ,

The biggest problem facing
them, he said, is a lack of analysis
of the arms race and nuclear wea-
pons from a U.S. standpoint.

“Socialists haven’t. partici-
pated in great numbers on behalf
of this cause as they have on
other areas of. social protest.”
J ailer blamed this on their lack of
“decent analysis” of the problem
and also on the sense that they

NORTHERN IRELAND - WHAT CAN I DO?

 
     
 

Most Irish-Americans and many non-Irish people of
compassion are asking our government to diplomatically
approach our ally, England, to start peace talks on
Northern Ireland involving all parties concerned. We are
not offering specific resolutions, that is up to the Irish
people.

 
   
       
    

In 1968 and 1969 Irish people in the northern Six
Counties parcipated in peaceful marches. These were
unsuccessful as was power sharing, the blanket protest,
the dirty protest, the first hunger strike, ten lives lost in
the second hunger strike, and finally, ‘elected representa-
tives were ignored. It is time to try peace forums and if the
American Government can act as a peace broker we all
should be willing to support this effort.

        
   
   
   
   
  

Please‘ help us in our efforts. We meet the fourth Tues-
day of each month at 8:00 pm at the Blarney Stone in
Etna. Please write: Irish National Caucus, Inc., 803
Swissvale Ave. Pgh., Pa. 15221, or phone (412) 243-5201

.The‘Pitt News, Wednesday March 16, 1933

Sexuality, a sacred issue that
used to hold well-protected
secrets, has been let out of the
closet. Priests, rabbis and minis-

- ters alike possess the attitudes

their faith instills and are willing
to discuss the volatile subject.
Although each denomination
is dedicated to its particular
“code,” every religion, be it
Roman Catholic, Jewish, or Pro-
testant, basically has a common
outlook on sexuality.

The consensus seems to be
that human sexuality is a gift
from God. Sexual intercourse is
viewed as the greatest bond of
intimacy by which a man and a
woman can fully express their
love for one another.

However, with this definition
of human sexuality, we are able
to better distinguish the division

_ between each religious sector

because of its concentrated .
views. .
The catholic view on sexual
intercourse and its acceptance
within the church’s canon law is .
that it is reserved exclusively for
couples who have been joined in
the sacrament of matrimony.
This fullest expression of love is
the function of procreation and
should be viewed as such,‘
according to church law.
_ The catholic view on premari-
tal sex, therefore, is quite rigid.
Father Sommers, a pastor at
Pitt, said, “When a couple
comes in for counselling and are
either pre-engaged or engaged,
we are aware of the difficulty it is '
to counsel them because they
are moving toward a ﬁnality.
“We ask such questions as

i when the tentative marriage is

and why there is a delay. If, for
example, the response is they
feel they aren’t ready for mar-
riage, then it is made clear they
may not be ready for a sexual
commitment as well. So we urge
that they remain in a state of
purity for as long as possible.”

When the situation changes
and a person chooses to have
sexual relations with someone
for purely hedonistic reasons,
counselling is much more clear-
cut because no love is involved.

Premarital sex and cohabita-
tion are viewed as promiscuous
behavior and confessable sins in
the Roman Catholic Church."

Another Christian faith takes
a more lax stance on premarital
sex. Protestantism, unlike
Catholicism, does not necessar-
ily view the prime purpose of
sexual relations as procreation.
 According to Lauren Chafee,
United Methodist clergywoman,
_ “We view sexuality as a means
of expressing and enhancing the
love between two people.

“Within the context of a car-
ing relationship where responsi-
bility is shown with regard to
pregnancy, venereal disease and
the needs of each individual, the
level of sexual intimacy is a per-
sonal decision between the two
people affected.

“The church still leans toward
the affirmation of sexual inti-
macy only within the confines of
a marriage relationship.”

realistic, is aware of the chang-
ing society, thenumber of sin-
gles, the changing roles of
women and the mobility of indi-
viduals and families.

“The church needs to
respond by encouraging po_si—
tive, responsible and caring atti-
tudes toward whatever sexual
lifestyle people choose,” Chaf-
fee said. . .

Living together, Chaffee
believes is also a personal
option. “It is not the ideal, per-
haps, but I would never say it is
sinful,” Chaffee said.

The Jewish faith views sexual-
ity as not only a strengthening of
love but as ameans of procrea-
tion as well. The traditional
members of Judaism lean in the
direction of sex within the con-
fines of marriage. -

The views of the Reform Jewsi
or more liberal Jewish people,.
however, differ.

According to Rabbi Joseph

Levine of B’nai B’rith Hillel, the
consensus among ‘young Jews
on campus seems to be “that
sexuality is regarded as sacred,_
not exploitative, and the right
attitude is needed because a
sexual relationship releases a
power passion in the human
psyche.”
a more traditional upbringing,
usually respect the wishes of
their parents and the Jewish law.
On the other hand, those who
have been raised in a liberal
manner will conduct their sexual
lifestyles accordingly, Levine
said.

If a Jewish person is able to"

express his religious identity and
does not act impulsively, his
judgment can generally be

trusted to be in compliance with

his upbringing, according to
Levine.

Cohabitation is usually
frowned upon because the Jew-
ish‘ law does not condone it.
Depending on the level of Juda-
ism, however, the sentiment
may differ.

In the Christian religions, the
“problem” of mixed marriages-
marriage between different
religions—isn’t a problem at all.
For example, in the Roman
-Catholic Church, pre-marriage
instructions» are offered so that
the non-Catholic member of a
mixed couple will learn about
the Catholic doctrines. P

intermarriage in the Jewish
faith is not permitted.

However, Rabbi Levine sited
as a recurring situation the one
generally involving graduate stu-
dents, a Jewish and a Christian,
who have gone through under-
graduate school together, per-
haps even having lived together
for a while, and are truly in love.

Both parties are bright and
educated, and they believe they
can make the marriage work.

A big issue that comes up,
however is the faith of any child-
ren the‘ couple will have. Prob-
lems with the couple’s
disapproving parents also arise,
according ‘to Levine, and there
are often incidents of bitterness
and rejection, with the students
wanting the marriage but trying

rite

to maintain their parents’ love.

Another problem is that
neither party may be willing to
convert. Both Reform and tradi-
tional Jews hold strong feelings
about mixed marriages, even
today, and unless there has been
a conversion, rabbis generally
will not perform the marriage
ceremony.

“Birth control causes little
problems for Protestants
because of a» de—emphasis on the
procreative role of sex, we do
not condemn the prevention of
pregnancy as an interference
with God’s will [as Catholicism
does].”

She said that birth control
measures outside of and within
marriage reflect a responsible
attitude towards the future.

“It frees people to explore this
expression of love and affection
without worry of unwanted
pregnancy,” she said. “The birth
of a child should be wanted and
prepared for.” _ -

Levine said the Reform Jews
believe a more ﬂexible outlook
should be taken toward birth
control.

The traditional and Conserva-
tive Jews, however, still do not
encourage birth control,
although many have come to
understand it better.. _

The Catholic Church takes a
strong stance against any con-
traceptive devices. A

“We stress abstinence or the
rhythm or Billings 'method as
means of birth control,” Father
Sommers said. The church con-
siders some contraceptive devi-
ces, such as the intrauterine
device (IUD) as abortive
factions. I P

The Catholic Documant on
Human Life is officially against
artiﬁcial birth control devices,
not the number of children a
family has, as some believe. The
use of artiﬁcial birth control is
considered a confessable sin.

The Catholics, believing that
life begins at the moment of con-
ception, also view abortion as a

confessable sin.

“Life is a gift from God, and
although the baby is genetically
different from -the mother, it is
still dependent on her,”
Sommers said.

In the case of the mother’s life
being in danger during childbirth
or pregnancy, however, mea-
sures may be taken to save the
mother’s life. If the baby should
die, it is not considered to be an
intended abortion by the
Catholic Church.

If a woman should become
pregnant as a_ result of being
raped, the church believes that
she should immediately go to the
hospital,be checked and have a
“cleaning of the inner organs.”

In general, abortion is consi-
dered a mortal sin’ in the
Catholic religion, and confes-
sion, in addition to reconcilia-
tion, must be carried out.

The Jewish religion approves
of abortion in special situations,
such as the mother’s life being in
danger or the possible case of
the baby’s being severely
retarded. - ~ - » "f

The mid-1960s are often
looked upon as that point in our
cultural development at which
young-men and women, armed
with a fresh outlook and a fool-
proof contraceptive (the Pill),
stopped suppressing their
instincts and began experienc-
ing a “sexual revolution.”

Sexuality in young people
had, up to that point, been con-
fined to furtive gropings or clan-
destine rendezvous and carried
a general feeling of anxiety,‘ not
only about the immediate social
consequences of sexual expres-
sion but about the possibility of
pregnancy as well.

Social tolerance for permari-
tal sexual activity in the ’50’s was
extended to those who
“planned” on getting married, or
at most, to those couples whose
affection for each other gave
way to the strain of physical
urgency. ’

The Pill was instrumental in
turning the standards a few
degrees in favor of women,
allowing them for the first time in
history to experience sex with-
out concern and giving them the
freedom to affirm their sexuality
in a society that favored a double

‘standard.

When has ensued in the past
20 years is not an ideal state of
man and woman approaching
sex as equals, but a state of con-
fusion for the man whose posi-
tion has been threatened by an
increasingly aggressive‘ female
population, and for the woman,
whose sexual status‘ is still not
clearly defined by society.

College-age males have tradi- .

tionally been the “sowers of wild
oats” and are encouraged to
seek multiple partners as part of
their rite of passage into
manhood.

College-age women, on the

other hand, have been encour-'
aged to select a suitable “mate,”

if not for marriage, then at-least
for social acceptance. ‘

Although women are
reminded‘ in slogan that they
have “come a long way, baby,”
they in fact have not come far
enough to escape the moral
judgment of their peers if they
behave in a sexually promiscu-
ous fashion, according to some
female students. .

According to psychologist
Ann Oakley, “Both males and
females must have some pro-
pensity for sexual behavior if
copulation is to occur, butthis
propensity is held to be different
in male and female.

“Along with the males’ greater
aggression in other fields goes
his aggression in the ﬁeld of sex-
uality: males initiate sexual
contact—they assume the domi-
nant position in intercourse.
Males ask females to go to bed
with them or marry them or
both, notvice versa.”

Oakley also said that the
female personality is one that
stereotypically brings “romantic
idealism rather than lustful real-
ity” to a relationship, and some
of the problems that crop up
among students today stem
from a breach of stereotype on
the part of the female.

Bob LaCivita, who has taught
a human, sexuality course at Pitt
since 1977, said that females

who express their desires.

College  

just a fantasy,” LaCivita said.

\

openly and honestly to men
present a threat to the males
who are more traditionally
rooted.

Some anxiety develops in
males when their expectations
are disturbed by a woman who
takes the initiative in a
relationship. . .

Many w_o_men, on the other
hand, are afraid to take the initia-

 

tive in a relationship becauseqﬂ,

they feel that society has not yet
fully endorsed this behavior in
women and that they will
frighten a man away if they come
on too strong.

Erica H., a senior, described
herself as “a fairly progressive-
thinking woman” who was
reared on the ideals set forth in
the feminist-oriented ’70s.

“I was encouraged to take the
Pill when I was. 15, and I’m not
looking for a husband or even a
steady boyfriend, but when I

meet a guy I’d like to have a rela—,,' 1:

tionship with, even just a physi-
cal one, I get the impression that
he thinks I’m sleazy if I don’t let
him make the first moves.”

LaCivita said that young peo- '

ple are exposed to models of
sexual ideals in television and
the movies that leave them with
a false set of expectations about
their own sexual identity and of
the opposite sex. ’ .

The standards of behavior set
forth by the media still feature,
to a great extent, the man as a
restless conqueror and the»4
woman as a passive recipient of
his attentions. ~

Many students, said LaCivita,
still base their expectations on
the degree of success that they
feel they’ve achieved in emulat-
ing these role models. I

“What we see presented on
television is the ultimate,- but it’s

“Egos are threatened because
this is what we are tqld will make
us appealing. Sex is part of our
egos, the way we feel about our-
selves as sexual people.”

LaCivita said he believes a lot
of anxiety is overcome by both
sexes when the problems are
freely exchanged in an honest
fashion.

One of the problems dis-
cussed by students most fre-
quently is the miscom-
munication that exists between
themselves and members of the
opposite sex. Women seek to
know what men want from-~ a
relationship and vice versa.

“Males view females as want-
ing someone who accepts-
them,” LaCivita said, “and basi-
cally, females take the same
view of men. The underlying
meaning is acceptance and love
from the opposite sex.”

LaCivita sees this as the cen-
tral themein the problems that
are brought to the forefront in
this course, and he believes that
behavior hasn’t changed that
much between men and women
over the years.

‘What is different about rela-
tions between men and women
today is their willingness to
express what their “desires and
needs are. ‘

For example, female sexuality
in the past was held to involve
long arousal and slow satisfac-
tion, while male sexuality was

believedto, involve .tlie.opp_qs_it.e_.‘.. . ,7. .

Sexual performance for both
sexes can take a confusing, and
sometimes disastrous turn when
these expectations are not met.

LaCivita said that these are
“the boundaries that end up
being deterrence fears, the fear
of impotency on the part of the
male, and frigidity on the part of
the female.”

There is pressure on the male
to perform according to these
unreal expectations, and as a
result, many men, according to
LaCivita, “begin tying their egos
into their sexual relations, and
not their emotions. '

“This kind of guy is going to
have problems dealing with
women,” LaCivita said. “He’s a
machine, and he’s not attaching
any emotional feeling to the sex-
ual act.”

Females, on the other hand,
are expected to be keyed into
the emotional aspect of the rela-

“As far as the pill’s leading to
promiscuity, I don’t believe that
one leads to another any more
than sex education leads to pro-
miscuity,” said Devoe, who has
worked with birth control coun-
selling for 15 years.

Last year, the Student Health
Center here at Pitt had 1,023 vis-
its from patients inquiring about
birth control.

These consisted of new
patients, those who wanted to
change methods and those who
wanted more information about
birth control but did not neces-
sarily want to begin any method.

“I think in most of my contact
with‘ students, the majority of
them are on a one-on—one, on-
going relationship rather than
something more casual,” Devoe
said. “Students don’t seem to
indicate that they are doing a lot

a traditional conﬂict for young women.

tionship rather than the perfor-
mance aspect, and this too, said
LaCivita, is a misconception
that must be put down.

One, male student who has
taken the human sexuality
course said, “I think a lot of guys
are confused about the way they
think women want them to act,
and it’s tough to try to live up to a
macho‘ image. You find out that
a lot of women don’t really want
that. .

“At the same time it’s scary to
meet women who are really
aggressive because you don’t
know how to treat them,” he
said.

One widely-shared view is
that the availability of almost fool
proof birth control methods like
the Pill has in recent years
encouraged promiscuity since
now the fear of pregnancy can
be so easily eliminated.

Jan Devoe, who works closely
with birth control at the Student
Health Center, does not believe
that this is the case

 

 

ever changes

be more conservative in that it is
a one-to-one relationship rather
than a series of casual
relationships.” '

One change that Devoe has
noticed throughout the years is
an increased interest on the part
of the male about whether or not
his partner is using birth control.

“I see that as.the really big
change,” she said. “Men come
along to the counselling sessions
or they encourage the women to
come in and get protection.
They don’t seem to assume that
if a woman is willing to have sex
with him, she is protected.”

LaCivita said that there is still
a degree of alienation existing
between some men and women
today because of an unwilling-
ness to accept promiscuity in
the opposite sex on an emo-
tional level.

“Intellectually, it is accepted, .

but what is given up is intimacy,”
he said. “The bottom line is that
both men and women want the

same thing, and that is love and '

acceptance. I. don’t think this‘

thereof, because of sexual or
affectional orientation any

ment, housing, credit, con-
tracting, provisions of
services, or any other matter
whatsoever. _

This statement comes

'from a Governor’s Office.

Executive Order signed by

"Milton Shapp in 1975 and

amended in 1978. It protects
homosexuals from discrimi-
nation based on sexual pref-
erences by state agencies or
state sub-contractors.

This was a big advance-
ment forlgay rights in Pen-
nsylvania, but an executive
order is not the same as the
law, and any governor may
rescind the order at any time.
So far, gay rights activists
have been unsuccessful in
their attempts to get the state
legislature to enact a gay
rights law.

Another advancement
came _in 1980 when the State
Supreme Court decided to
overturn the laws that made
certain sexual behaviors, in
which homosexuals engage,
a crime, thus legalizing “sod-
omy” in Pennsylvania.

The gay community in
Pittsburgh had‘ no’ support
groups that exclusively
catered to their needs before

1972. Gay Alternatives of '
(GAP) was

Pittsburgh
founded in late 1972. ,

They continued to grow,
sponsoring various social
activities, Gay Pride Marches
and a legal defense fund.

In 1975, GAP lost its drive
and folded. This group
“broke the ice,” so to speak,
prompting many other gay
support groups to open "all
over the city.

One such group ﬂourished
right here on campus—Gay
Students at Pitt (GSP). They
officially‘ formed in Sep-
tember of 1972 with about a
dozen members. Over the
years they hve been involved
with many activities ranging
from bringing guest speakers
to campus and sponsoring
workshops to assembling a
gay library and participating
in gay marches.

The group changed its
name to Gay Supporters at

Pitt in 1978, indicating the ,

inclusion of faculty nd staff,
and presently exists as the
University of Pittsburgh's
Gay and Lesbian Alliance
(GALA).

GALA’s president, Jon
Marx, saidthe main reason
for changing‘ the name to
GALA is because the term
gay used to encompass male
and female homosexuals, but
today the term is used prim-
arily in reference to male
homosexuals. ._ ’

The Pitt News, Wednesday. March[l6, 1933

  Homosexuality:  

Ch

The purpose of the group,
according to Marx, is to “fos-
ter awareness and under-
standing among the campus
community—faculty, staff,
and students—of the gay and
lesbian community’s political,
health, and social needs.”

The group activities

. planned for next year include

a reception for new and
returning students, two lec-
ture/ workshops, and the
maintenance of a speakers’
bureau that talks to various
classes at Pitt and a trip to
New York City during Gay
Pride Week. _

These projects are not
concrete because GALA’s
budget has not yet been
approved by the Student
Government Board.

Marx said a major acomp-_
lishment for the group is that
they are recognized on cam-
pus as a student organ-
ization.

Another gay support
group in Pittsburgh is the Per-
sad Center and its offshoot

- the Gay and Lesbian Com-

munity Center. They provide
co_unselling for gay men,
women, youths and their
families, ‘plus other social,
political and educational
services. '

Persad was funded by
Allegheny County until
County Commissioners
Forester and Hunt axed the
center's previously approved

funds in September of 1974. .

One major conﬂict affect-
ing the gay community con-
cerns the Christian Church.
Homosexuality is for the

most part condemned by

Christianity. The Universal
Church of Celebration
(UCC) was the first church

- for gays in the Pittsburgh .

area. However, UCC had
some administrative difficul-
ties and closed in September

9, of 1974.

The Metropolitan Com-
munity Church (MCC),
founded in Los Angeles in
1967, opened a branch in
Pittsburgh in February of
1977 although MCC services

had been in existence two»

years prior to the official
opening. The MCC serves
the protestants within the gay
community.

Dignity is a religious group
that serves gay Catholics. It
was formed in 1974 and has
been a pillar of strength in the
gay community ever since.

Joseph, an officer of Digni-

ty/Pittsburgh, said that atti-
tudes towards gays and,

lesbians has ‘changed greatly
over the past two years.

According to Joseph, two
years ago Dignity had a hard
time finding a priest to cele-
brate Mass with them.
Today, they have more than
enough.

Dignity/Pittsburgh is now
allowed to meet with one of
the Bishops of the Diocese,
whereas the group had never

been recognized before. The_
_ members of Dignity/Pitts-_

gradual. . L

anging  

burgh are, according to
Joseph, “people he (the
Bishop) needs to help and be
with.”

“Pittsburgh is a straight

San Francisco. It is a very cul-
tural community and a very
conservative community,”
Marx said. “As long as things
aren’t ﬂamboyant and openly
gay, you’re fine in Pitts-
burgh.”

He attributes this attitude‘
to the fact that Pittsburgh is a
corporate center, and the

corporations based here are _

very conservative.

A prominent gay commun-
ity would discourage new
corporate growth and the
existing corporations would
leave, according to Jose-pi.
He said that there does  .
to be a struggle between- gay
communities and corporate
heads——corporations don’t‘
like to settle in areas with a
big gay population.

On the Pitt campus, Marx
said that he has heard about
many problems concerning
harassment. For example, he
has heard of students being
thrown out of their fraterni-
ties because they were gay,
and students being harassed
so badly in the dorms that
they forced to move off cam-
pus. The general attitude
seems to be negative.

Both Joseph and Marx.
believe, however, the overall
attitude toward gays is
improving.

“Attitudes are improving in
the city,” Marx said. The rea-
son for the improvement, he
said, lies in public awareness.
The issues concerning homo-
sexuality are becoming more
public—-more people are
hearing about them, and

. homosexuals are feeling less

repressed. “People [gays] are
telling their friends [they are
gay]. They are coming out of
the closet more,” Marx said.
With the removal of homo-
sexuality as a psychological
disorder from the American
Psychiatric Association’s
Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual, Marx said, “In 1973,
we suddenly becamesane.”

Joseph said that for the "

first time this year, City
Council discussed at length

the possibility of a gay rights _ '

law. .

He added that the media of
Pittsburgh has given more
attention to gayand lesbian
issues lately. For example,
KDKA’s Vibrations program
discussed gay and lesbian
issues for the first time a few
weeks ago. Also, hospitals in
the area, such as Magee
Women’s Hospital in Oak-
land, are also recognizing vic-
tims of homosexual rape as
rape victirn§.

These are all
changes concerning attitudes
towards gays, Marx said, but
the change is .slow and"

  Panthers Forge Past Colonials

hf?

By MARK’ A. SINDLER

9 A slight twist of irony was evident

i”‘_\’.ast‘ evening at the J oh‘n Jay athletic

center when the Pitt volleyball
squad faced off against Robert Mor-
ris. The Colonia-ls’coach, Jeff Beav-

ers, is,a former Pitt player under

Panther coach Ray Reilly.

Beavers didn’t fare too well
against the Panthers, but that might
be understandable, considering that
Beavers just found out two and a
half months ago that Robert Morris
wanted a volleyball program. The
Colonials fell to Pitt 15-6, 8-15, 15-6
and 15-7. The victory raised Pitt‘s
seasonal match mark to 13-8-1 and
dropped the Colonials to 3-6.

 That one winithat Robert Morris

 

Yrianaged to complete was of no sur- V

prise to middle hitter Barry Gold-
berg. The team had been practicing
as of late on a new type of offense
with which it experimented last
night.

“All six players are on the court as

hitters,” Goldberg explained. “But,
only two out of the six-aresetters.”
The Panthers big setter is senior
Dave Baird, but he was only used by

Reilly for one game, the third. Oth-
erwise, the Panthers employed _a 6-2
offense with Goldberg and junior
Tony Zortea setting.

“We ran the new offense, yet we .

only worked on it for a week in prac-
tice,” Goldberg added. “We proba-
bly lost that second game because of
this and the fact that the two setters
[Goldberg and Zorteal] don’t -have
much experience. Also, the other
four players were all freshmen.”

A couple of those freshmen, Tim
Rakovan and Mike Keating handled
most of the inside hitting. That isn’t
too uncommon for Reilly's game
situations.

Overall, the squad didn’t seem to
be too affected by its recent three-
week hiatus. The ﬁnal scores indi-
cate that the point margins are
relatively impressive, although it
was a match against a foe which
more resembles an infant than a
veteran volleyball team. ’

But Beavers is ‘slowly making
something of a volleyball program
at Robert Morris. Already, his team
has squared offagainst mostly east-
ern teams, including Rutgers, Army
and Cornell.

\

“We haven’t done too bad,” Beav-
ers said. “Injuries have hurt us a lit-
tle. _Plus, I was informed by the
school around the first of January
that they planned on having a pro-
gram this year, so things have been a
little hectic.” ’

Beavers is being overly kind with
statements like those. He started
assembling players by placing an ad
in the campus newspaper. He held
tryouts for about 15-20 potential
players, he said, and worked on
team assemblage from there.

It hasn’t been that easy achieving
this, he said, considering that the
squad usually holds practice ses-
sions from 9:30 p.m. till midnight.

“The athletic department puts the
main emphasis on basketball,”
Beavers said. “That’s the big thing
around here, so_we have to sor of
play around them. Sure, practices
are late, but the kids are taking it

pretty well; there haven’t been any

real problems yet.” .
Beavers played volleyball during
all of his four years at Pitt and later
did a little coaching at Steel Valley
High School. The program isjust at
the seed stage but is being aided by
some heavy recruiting Beavers is
completing in the grassroots area.

I always thought that an
empty half-gallon bottle of Gor-

P repa re 

For
NCAAs

By SCOTT DELLETT

‘For the Lady Panther swim team,
preparing for Nationals this year

will be different from last year. _
There are several reasons for this ,7

Pitt travels to the University of
Nebraska for the NCAA national
meet, which starts tomorrow and
runs through Saturday.

First, the organization is differ-
ent. Instead of the AIAW, the
NCAA will sponsor the meet for the
first time. Also, only the top 12 ﬁn-
ishers will make All-America status,

- whereas the first 16 finishers made it

in previous years.

A second thing that makes this
meet unique for the Lady Panthers is
the number of swimmers they will
take to Lincoln. Last year, Pitt took
nine swimmers and one diver to
Texas as they finished eighth in the

nation, the best finish ever by a Lad_£._A’__

Panther team.

However, only Jan Ujevich and
Sue Heon will represent Pitt. Coach
David Belowich would like to see
some fthe freshmen in the meet, but
he’s looking forward to the
championships.

“We had good swims in Eastern
and the Big East championships, but
the National cuts were so fast, it was
hard to get in,” he said.

There are advantages and set-
backs to having only two swimmers
in a national-caliber meet.

The good part is that I’ve been
able to spend more time with Jan
and Sue,” Belowich said. “It would
be nice if a large group were goi
so that they could support each
other.

“They have been working out
alone since the end of February. It’s
not as much fun having only two
people inthe water. You’d rather
have the whole team there.

But both Ujevich and Heon will
have the opportunity to go after per-
sonal glory. Ujevich will have the
opportunity to” become a four-time
All-America, the fourth swimmer to
achieve such an honor along with
Suzanne Pulley, Kathy Stetler and
Amy Jackson, and the sixth‘ Pitt ath-
lete, as Tony Dorsett and Hugh
Green also reached four-time All-
America status. 

\

With the NCAA taking over thé"*>\'

championships and the qualifying
times the fastest they have ever been,
Belowich believes this may put a lit-
tle more pressure on Ujevich than in
the past. , :

“Everyone. in the country is get-
ting faster and faster,” he said. “But
the pressure put upon her is self-
induced.

“Jan has always been competitive
at the National-caliber level. She-’s
used to being there. If she does what
she can do——and she has been swim-
ming well—she will have All-
America honors.”

According to Ujevich, the pres-
sure on her—if there is any—wil1
help her. -

“The only pressure is the pressure
I put on myself,” she said.

The addded competition pro§:;—~

duced by having to finish in the top
12 will help in her-quest for All-
America honors. ,

It's really a positive advantage fin-
ishing in the top 12 instead of the top
16,” Ujevich said. “It gives me extra
motivation.

“The differences in time are really
slight. The meet has the best in the
country. The races will be really
close.” ’

Ujevich said she is prepared for
the final meet of her colliegiate
career. .

“I definitely feel I’m ready," she

the two week break between Eastern
and Nationals, I have had a lot of
rest, which I needed.”

irhepiu News, Wednesday March 16, 1983 

By TIM DINGER

‘ For . the second straight year,
Panther wrestler Jeff Jelic has tra-
veled to the National Championship
and missed gaining All-America sta-
tus by a single win.

“We felt that he was good enough
to be All-American,” said assistant

’ *5-:3/’.D0ach Chuck Coryea. “He had a

good year and wrestled well at
Nationals, but he had a few break-
downs that cost him.”

Jelic’, loss in the consolation
round gave him ninth place finish
‘with the first eight being designated
as All-Americas. . r

In his first match of the tourna-I
ment, .Ielic,‘who was seeded eleventh .

- at I58 lbs.-, easily handled Wyom-
ing’s Ron Whitman, 9-4.

“I beat him pretty good, but I still i

didn’t wrest1e,well,”. said Jelic. “I
wrestled really tight, and I wouldn’t
let him move [when he was] on bot-
tom. 1 should have scored more
nearfalls on him. I'm not usually a

ﬂfast starter. My first match in tour-

’_ naments are usually less than
impressive." _ *-

Jelic injured his calf muscle in this
match. ~ ’

In his second match of the tourna-
ment, Jelic fell to the number two
seeded Lou Montano of Cal-Poly,
l0-6. Montano eventually went on
to place second.

“This was the second year in a row
that I was knocked out of the tour-
nament by a national finalist,” said
Jelic. A

Jelic started the match with a four
point lead. The score changed sev-
eral times after that but remained in

' _€8}[elic’s favor until Montano hit a

‘ ‘four pointmove that put him ahead

8-5.

“Instead of relaxing," said Jelic, “I
stayed too aggressive. He waited for
me to make mistakes and took me
down to my back.”

Jelic escaped, but still trailed by
two points. He had to again go on
the offensive and was taken down
with 15 seconds left. i V

_ After ‘Jelic battled Montano, he
had another battle off the mats with
his leg, and his weight.

“By this time I could hardly walk
because of my calf. I was 8% pounds

 over,” said Jelic. “Normally two

cw’-“V ‘r-hours would have been plenty of

‘ “’4'.‘u.3*.»x

time to make weight, but I couldn’t
run orjump rope.”

Jelic made weight with five min-
utes before weigh-ins ended to put

. him up against old Eastern Wres-

tling League (EWL) rival Doug
Buckwalter of Lock Haven. Jelic
_won the EWL title this year by
defeating Buckwalter 5-3 in the
finals. This time Jelic had a much
easier time,,winning 13-5, to match
him against Murry Crews of Iowa
,State in a battle for All-America
honors.
Crews won 10-8.

Midway through the second
period, the score was tied at 3-3, but

_ once again Jelic was thrown to his

back. He lost five points. .

With the score, 10-8 in the closing
minute of the third period, Jelic
worked toward a nearfall with a
front head-lock, but Crews rolled
through with five seconds left in the
match to pull out the victory.

Said Coryea, “In thetwo years
that he’s wrestled at Nationals, he’s
lost twice. He’s faced four All-
Americas. We’re not happy because
Jeff didn’t make All-America, but he
certainly doesn’t have anything to be
ashamed of.” '

“l‘ve got as much ability as

sanyone out there,” said Jelic. “The

 

‘ only problem is I’m going to have to

change my strategy.
“Those guys didn’t score by being

4 aggressive, they just sat back and

took advantage of my mistakes. I

_\ guess itsjust my lack ofexperience. l
” need‘ more experience in big;tourna- M
_ ments like this.” ’ ' f _. c '

Jelic JustMisses

- ¥-.

Au-America Honors

Jelic ended his junior year with a
21-8 record and his second EWL
title. He’s looking ahead to next
year.

“As soon. as I can catch up on the
two and a half weeks of school I’ve
missed because of competition and
getting my leg in shape, ‘I’ll start
training for‘ the summer tourna-
ments,” he said. “I need to wrestle a
lot of bigger tournaments so that I

can learn to relax in high-pressure
situation.” '

Coryea agrees, saying, “He’s

, going to have to get more experience

in different kinds of wrestling and
change his style a little. He has to
make that committment to improve.
Our whole team has to make that
committment, too. Everyone says
they want to become an All-
America, but Jeff has missed it
twice. Now he knows what it’s going
to take."

Jeff Jelic was denied a second chance at All-America honors by losing to Cal-Poly-’s

Lou Montano, 10-6.

CUSTOMER ‘INFORMATION FROM GENERAL MOTORS

  HOW TO

  STOP DRUNK DRIVING.-

TOUGH LAWS MAY HELP, BUT WE ALSO NEED TO CHANGE OUR ATTITUDES.

Do you know anyone
who’s in favor of drunk
driving? Not likely. And yet
many people have driven when
under the inﬂuence of alcohol,
or will ‘do it at least once. 

Take a look at some
chilling statistics. One out of
every two of us will be in-
volved in an alcohol-related
accident sometime during our
lives. Last year alone, more
than 25,000 people died in
such accidents; an additional
1.5 million were injured. A
disproportionate number of
those killed were under 25
years old. .

The cost of drunk-driving
accidents amounts to over $24
billion‘ every year in property
damage, loss of wages, medical
and legal fees. Not to mention '
the emotional pain to the vic-
tims’ families and friends.

What is being done
about it? Over the years,
many different approaches
have been tried: mandatory
jail sentences, stiff fines,
license suspensions, alcohol-
rehabilitation programs, and

4 higher drinking-age laws.

No single countermeas-
ure seems to do the job by
itself. Tough laws, unless they
are supported by equally tough
enforcement and the certainty
of punishment, don’t seem to

work over the long run. Even
with all three, probably the
most effective single thing we
could do is to examine our
own attitudes about drinking

and driving. " .

How much do you reall
know about the effects of
alcohol? The facts may sur-
prise you. For example, a lot
of people believe that beer
and wine are less__ intoxicat-
ing than other drinks. In
fact, a can of beer, a glass
of wine, or a 11/2'Ol.1l’1C€ drink »
of 86-proof liquor are all
about equally intoxicating.

A lot of factors deter-
mine how quickly you’ll get

— drunk. Your body weight, how

much you’ve had to eat, and’
the number of drinks you have
over a specified time all make
a difference. That’s why it’s
so hard to know when you’ve
had too much.

A common’ legal defini-
tion of intoxication is .10 per-
cent blood-alcohol level. For

a 160 lb. person, it takes about

four or five drinks in the first
two hours on an empty stom-
ach to reach the legal limit,
compared with three or four
drinks in the first two hours
forsomeone who weighs 120
lbs. Of course, your judgment
and reaction time will be
impaired well before you reach
the legal limit. .
At General Motors, we’re
very concerned about the
effects of drinkingon driv-
ing. Over a decade ago, we
developed a device that tests
a driver’s reﬂexes and motor
responses before starting the

' car. The Department of Trans-

portation is now ﬁeld—testing
that device.

We also strongly favor
all efforts that focus attention
on the problem such as the
Presidential-Commission on
Drunk Driving. Make sure
your friends and family know
the facts about mixing alco-

hol and-driving. Drunk driv-

ing will only stop when we
all decide it isn’t socially
acceptable. Be self-conﬁdent
enough to admit when you’ve
had too much to drink to drive
safely. —
Meanwhile, seat belts
are still your best protec-
tion against drunk drivers.
They can’t prevent an acci-
dent, but they will help save

‘ your life during a serious

crash— whatever the’ cause.

the sweet side of life is now chew-
ing away at their insides.

A judge’s decisions aside, Puz-
zuoli and Atiyeh have roasted
enough. They have been blitzed
with enough wisecrack remarks

— to last through three football
careers. They are athletes in the

limelight.
But, they are individuals, too.

At issue is whether athletes
should receive more publicity
than an average person when off
the field. Perhaps, but not to the
point where football players are
categorized as monsters, as indi-
viduals misusing their talents.

Puzzuoli and Atiyeh had a
skirmish with the law. The same
can be said of about a million
other individuals during the
course of a year. They are no
different, save for the fact that
the football players are ‘sup-
posedly still innocent—still not
proven guilty. A day in court is
soon to come, which must be
particularly difficult for
Puzzuoli.

Just four months ago he was

The setting: I Champaign,
Illinois.

The plot: Pitt and Illinois are -

nooked up in a close game. Pitt
was looking for a national cham-
pionship; Illinois for some
national recognition.

The scene: Illinois quarter-
back Tony Eason lofts a pass
toward Pitt’s goal line, which is
picked off by Puzzuoli and
returned 95 yards for a Panther
touchdown. “A lineman’s
dream,” Puzzuoli explained
afterward.

Now, Puzzuoli is burning in
Hell. A rope is wrapped around
his neck and everyone is giving it

.a good yank. The sight of him

ambling down the sideline has
been replaced by visions of an
execution. The game which had
treated Puzzuoli so well until
about a month, ago has become

his worst enemy.

The people who were cheering
Puzzuoli and Atiyeh are now
thrusting a knife in their backs.

The Pitt'News, Wednesday March 16, 1983 ’

Senior Jan Ujevich has tour on her mind, hoping to attain her fourth All-
America award, becoming only the fourth swimmer in Pitt history reaching

that milestone.

Swimmers
Prepare

‘Tor  
  NCAAS

continued from page sixteen
honors behind her, Ujevich kept on
thinking about it.

“I had to remind myself so Icould»
qualify for NCAAS,” Ujevich said. ‘

Unlike Belowich, Ujevich sees a
benefit from not having a number of
swimmmers participating.

“It might be an advantage since 1

_$ can concentrate on individual
‘lyléhients, though I would have liked to

swim in some relay,” she said. “It’s
too bad we couldn’t qualify some
other swimmers orrelay teams.”

, In the past, the senior from Ali-
quippa had not been satisfied with
her performances, but this season
was different.

“I was pleased with my perfor-
mance,” Ujevich said. “In every
meet, I brought my times down. I
feel confident my times can come
down in the most important meet of
the season.”

Ujevich will swim in the 100-and

200-‘yard individual medley while _

Heon will participate in the 500-and
1,650-yard freestyle slong the 400-‘

'-’g§,)?yard individual medley and 400-

 

yard backstroke.

Belowich believes both national
and international competition will
benefit Heon, a two-time All-
America swimmer.

“Sue has a lot of competitive
experience,” he said. “I think she has
been pointing at this meet for a long
time.”

Unlike lat year, the Lady Panthers
can’t look towards a high team finish
this year. But with two outstanding
performers like Heon and Ujevich,
the trip to Nebraska may be
worthwhile. O

tournament's director decided to
invite five other women’s team and
as a result, five men’s teams had to
go. Reilly’s was one of those.

According to Goldberg, the near-
month long break may have done
the team some good.

“It might have hurt us in a way,”
he said, “but we have a long session.
We’ve practiced all week and
learned a new offense. It all comes
down to Easterns. We’re gearing for
that because it all comes down to
that one week.”

roughed up some cops several
weeks ago., 

“Allegedly?”.;Foo Baba: asked,
demanding an answer. ‘ _ '

“Yeah, well, you see there have
been more than __the usual
amount of discrepancies sur-
rounding the players’ predica-
ment,” I tried to explain.
“Probably because they are foot-
ball players, and cops and
gridders don’t usually make a

_ .433 _od mix when it comes to
' brushes with the law.”

“I knew it, I knew it, I knew it,”
Foo Baba droned. “That is’ pre-
cisely why I have completed this
missionary visit. It bothers me to
no end the stereotype with which
football players are labelled. The
practice of unfairness saddens
me to no end.”

I could sense Foo Baba was in
a deep despair; he sighed heavily
and in a resigned way. He needed
some consolation. '

“Foo Baba, gather yourspirits
and listen closely,” I said cau-
tiously. “What Puzzuoli and
Atiyeh were involved in with the

"’vg?0IICC doesn’t fit the football
étereotype. Early indications
point to the fact that both will
probably win their cases, but jus-
tifiably so.

“Consider, if you will, the fact
that both were «no handcuffed
that dismal morning when they
were arrested. If both were as
violentas the numerous cops tes-
tified they were [at last week’s
preliminary hearing], would you
not think they would be cuffed to
curb their inordinary behavior.”

“Ah, you may have a point
there,” Foo Baba said, his atten-
tion being -aroused. ' _

“But wait,” I interrupted.

._'.\.-- “Please, let me continue. You
a 0 have to realize that of the
seven: cops at the scene that
m'or'ning‘ not one of them saw
Puzzuoli pick up officer
DeVelma Coleman and throw
he’rW into the street. Of course,
Coleman testified that he did it,
but wouldn't. you think that with -
that many cops there, at least one
of the others would have seen ‘
him throw her into the street?

“They only testified that they

~ saw her just laying on the

r ground,” I continued, sensing
that Foo Baba was feeling some-
what better.

“And mull over this one, Foo

_ Baba. With seven officers there,
‘4f)I10w could it be that they suffered
all kinds of abrasions and
injuries—as they testified they
did—if they had a three-to-one

. advantage?” '

“Oooh, you do have a point
there, son. If anything, though, it
surely says something of the
ineptness of your city police
department. Seven officers? And
they put up with punches and
clenched fists, as they say they
did? Unbelievable!"

“Right you are," I said. “The

cops in Oakland don’t exactly
have a love affair going with Pitt
football players, and it seems
that they had Puzzuoli and
Atiyeh mapped out on‘ Feb. 20.
They wanted their heads.”

“So the players really weren’t_
the troublemakers, then, were

they? But I wonder when the real .

facts will come out and the play-
ers will be cleared,” Foo Baba
pondered aloud. . \ ,

“Well, the players’ trial won’t

-,commence for a while now,

probably late summer. But, once
it does, their attornies will proba-
bly have medical records show-
ing that the policewoman didn’t
suffer any critical injuries and
that the cops had no concrete
reasons for arresting Puzzuoli
and Atiyeh.”

I had started falling asleep by

The Pitt! News, Wednesday March  1983. I
Innocence Fumbled Before Trial ’siStart      _,     L _   ,

O now, chronic yawning setting in
n at an unbelievable speed. And I

was almost as sure of the evening
blackness outside as I felt the-
almost unbearable force of the
two sandbags perched atop my
eyelids.

Foo Baba, too, saw the change
through which I was going and
bade me farewell, again apolog-
izing for interrupting my
evening.

And with that, faster than I
could blink, the gaseous cloud
vanished into the smoke-filled
air. I heard it being sucked back
into the dust-covered gin bottle.

Only I‘ was left there. When I
woke up, I found my head resting
on the history book I had been
trying to decipher when the mys-
terious buddha made his
appearance. .
