Top British Educator
Lectures Next Week

One of Britain’s foremost edu-
cators, Sir Richard Winn Livings-
tone, vice-chancellor of Oxford

University, delivers the first lec-
ture of the 1948 Pitcairn-Crabbe
series, at Stephen Foster Memo-
rial Hall, Wed. April 14 at 8:15
p.m.

The title of Sir Richard’s lecture
is “Recent Educational Develop-
ments in England."

An authority on Greek and

9 Latin and a prominent world edu-

cator, Sir Richard has been the
vice-chancellor of Oxford Univer-
sity since 1933. ,

In England the position of vice-
chancellor generally corresponds
to that of chancellor or president
in American universities. The
Chancellor of a British university
is usually a purely honorary title.

In addition to being vice-chan-
cellor of Oxford, Sir Richard is
president of Corpus Christi Col-
lege, Oxford, England.

Born in 1880, the son of the late
Reverend Canon Livingstone of
Liverpool, Sir Richard received
his education at Belfast, Toronto,
Durham, and Manchester.

In 1931 Sir Richard was elevat-
ed to the knighthood by. the late

Congress Stays Silent  
On Speakers Issue

Student Congress turned thumbs down Tuesday on a Students-
for-Wallace proposal that Congress forward a resolution favoring ap-
pearance of political speakers to the deans’ committee now con-
sidering the problem. ’

The deans’ committee is preparing a report on University policy
‘ ‘V on politics after holding hearings
with students, faculty, and some
Congress members.

The completed report will be
submitted to Chancellor Fitzger-
ald.

Congress to Permit
Write-In Ballots; IF, 
Independents Line Up

‘Names of 16 men have been placed before the male stu-
dent body of the University for its appraisal and selection with
the announcement of the returns of the Student Congress nom-
inating committee action.

But a second announcement by that committee promises
to bring much more in the Way of ﬁreworks. For the ﬁrst time

in the history of the present Student Congress constitution,
the ballot will be open to all comers through, write-in vote per-
mission.

Gene Thrasher, reporting on the work of the annually ap-

pointed group at last ’l‘uesday’s Congress meeting virtually-
‘cleared the Way for hard—swinging political activities during

the next week and a half. Elections take place on ‘Wednesday,
. ‘April 21.

Missing from the list are the
names of two incumbents, Bob
Dickey and Franklin Blackstone.
Reports indicate that these men,
along with Ray Pluskey, leader of
the Pitt Independents Association,
will take advantage of the write-
in proviso.

Fraternity sources indicate that
both Dickey and Blackstone, to-
gether with Sam Simpson, treas-
urer of IF Council, will make up
the heart of the IF slate.

Pluskey, another write-in can-
didate, will team up with Stuart
Workmaster, old campaigner with
the Pitt Veterans Association and
the independents to provide the
one-two punch for the Independ-
ent slate.

The present Congress reversed
another decision on the election
when it decided last Tuesday to
place the proposed by—laws before
the student body in one complete
sweep. The voters may vote either
“yes” or “no” to the entire collec-
tion of by-laws.

The theory behind the reversal
is that the students will be able

ﬁcult for Congress to act in ac-
cord with student opinion, as he
had found a split of opinion
among students about ,whether
there should be politics on cam-
pus.

Frank Blackstone, a Congress
member, agreed with Mr. Bidd1e’s
view, adding that it would be un-
fair to submit a recommendation
to the deans’ committee now, since
its report is near completion.

Gene Trasher, Congress mem-

Congress not make any recom-

0pen Ballot

‘Announcement of the 16 candidates for Stu-
dent Congress, on the male side, brings to light
again the inadequacy of the present nomina-
tions system. The use of a hand-picked group
to pick another hand-picked group of candi-
dates is apalling. It is a break down of demo-
cratis action as far as student government here
is concerned. '

Members of this year’s Nominating Commit-
tee, along with those of the past, realize this
point. They were disgusted with the method.
But, this year’s group was the ﬁrst to at-
tempt to do something about the situation.

True, next year, if the proposed constitu-
tion revisions go through, this situation can
not occur. A man who is not nominated will
be able to petition and be placed on the bal-
lot. Such is not the case, as deﬁned by the
present constitution.

This year’s Nominating Committee placed
before Student Congress a request to permit
write—in ballots. Congress accepted. The door
is wide open now for anyone to be elected to
Congress. -

Reasons for this action on the part of the
Committee stem from dissatisfaction in two
opposing political forces. IF Council and the

fraternity boys in general, object to the ex-

clusion of incumbents Frank Blackstone and
Bob Dickey. Independent leaders dislike om-
mission of Ray Pluskey, their present driving

. force. Both organizations are justiﬁed in their

opinions. ,

Likewise, the nominations group can feel
justiﬁed. They, at least, realize their inade-
quacy. ‘ _

Fertile for A Speakers"

Prominent speakers in several ﬁelds are
invading the area of the University this week”
and next. We can only regret that this is news,
but the appearance of these nottables should
give the lie to those who say that nobody ever
speaks here. The list of dinners, discussions,
and lectures include something of interest for
each student and faculty member.

Hal Lehrman, authority on'Russia and the

Middle East, spoke before the’ Student As-

sembly and the Phi Eta Sigma banquet on
Wednesday. Next Wednesday, April 14, at
2:30 p. m., Sigrid Schultz, noted woman re-

_ porter of European affairs,‘ will address the

Student Assembly on “Rceducation of Ger-
many.” T v

R Also on Wednesday of,next Week, Sir Rich-
ard Livingstone, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford
University and President of Corpus Christi

College, will speak under the auspices of the

Pitcairn-Crabbe Foundation. The same night,

. United World Federalists will sponsor Leland

Stowe, radio commentator and Pulitzer Prize-
winning journalist, in a speech at Carnegie
Music Hall.

On Thursday, April 15th, V. K. Wellington
Koo, Chinese ambassador to the United States,
will speak at a dinner and discussion of the
Foreign Policy Association of Pittsburgh, in
the ballroom of the Hotel Webster Hall.

This is an imposing group. It stands out
especially, though, because we so seldom see
such a constellation of big-name speakers here
at Pitt. If past experience is a. guide, we may
expect seven lean years to follow next week.
Speakers like these can makeoan important
contribution to the scholastic life of the Uni-
versity. How can we get more of them?

 A News Editor Frank Davis
A Enjoys Trip to Philly
Issue

Between Other Tasks A

By Bill Veenis

The Intercollegiate Conference on Government
meets today under that trite “shadow of Indepen-
dence Hall” in Philadelphia. The meeting will be
covered by newspaper writers and photographers,
wire services, radio, and television.

Pitt’s share in the group“ amounts to a
handful of poli sci students and Frank Davis,

a news editor of the Pitt News. As state pub-
licity director for ICG, our soft spoken, en-
ergetic news editor has bombarded these news
media with letters and publicity blurbs.’

Last Tuesday Frank arose at ﬁve a. m. to board
a plane for Philly in order to make ﬁnal prepara-
tion and arrangements for today’s meetings.
Throughout the past two years he has maintained
contacts with ICG representatives from other par-
ticipating colleges in Pennsylvania, giving them
periodic encouragement and keeping close checks
on their activities.

_ Frank’s ascendency to a position of cam- A
pus prominence in following his threc—year
hitch in the United States Navy has been re-
markable. Only a. year ago he was known as the

- star reporter of the News. Today he ranks with
the top news editors in the history of this
paper. , .

Twice he has edited the Pitt Summer News al-
most singlehandedly. He is president of Pi Delta
Epsilon, honorary journalism fraternity and is
touted by R. X. Graham, head of the journalism
department, as one of the most promising ¥under’3
graduates. - —  .

w Frank incorporated a married life ‘ into“ his

crowded schedule last fall ,when he and Wynn

Swith, former associate editor on the Pitt News,
joined in a lifetime journalistic combine. ‘
His next contribution to Pitt life’s Spring
Festivars Tap Day. He was named to head the

May 7 event in addition to handling‘ his other
time consuming‘. activities. I it

The Pitt News takes this opportunity, while
Frank is away on, another job, to point. him. out
as the real reason» for the wide news coverage
we've enjoyed this year. From a journalistfs point
of view, he's tops on Que list.

Mercury Caravan
Full of ‘Names’ -
Hit of Mosque

Music
Notes

—-—- Jerry Newberg

Mercury Records’ “Mercury Caravan” made a"

one night stand Wednesday eve at the Syria
Mosque. The show began at 8:30 p. in. Leading the
“Mercury Caravan” was Frankie Laine, supported
by J an August, Helen Humes -and Carl Fisher's
All-Stars which featured Flip Phillips, Muddy Mor-
row, Alvin Stoller, Tony Scott, Buc Clayton, Mun-
dell Lowe and J’ack'Lesberg. Guest M.C.’s were A1
Noble, KQV, Art Pallan and Jan Andre of WWSW,
and Bill Brant from KDKA. I 
While‘ at the Copa in the early part of
, March Frankie Laine made a. tremendous hit
with his unique vocal stylings. A capacity
crowd for all performances is a sure sign of
acceptance by Pittsburgh music lovers. _ His.
partner and arranger Carl Fisher was on hand.
Laine just can’t do without that wonderful
man. According to Laine "that boy Fisher is
my right tonsil.” i
Another great Mercury artist featured in the
Caravan was pianist Jan August who was catapu-
lated by a song into stardom. The song, or course,

was _“Misirlou” which by .the way has been re-

corded on the Mercury label and is scheduled for
release April 15. Before “Misirlou” Jan had been
playing New York clubs as "just another piano
player.” Then fate walked in and dumped this
great tune in his lap.‘

Helen Homes and Flip Phillips who were
also on the program played at the Mosque last
October when Norm Granz presented his "Jazz
At The Philharmonic.” Helen, a great little
singer is often referred to as the original “Be-
Baba-Leba” girl because of her very ﬁne re-
cording of same. Flip Phillips, featured tenor-
man, was once a member of the Woody Her-
man aggregation. However Flip broke con-
tract to form his own combo and has been
going on at a very successful clip.

With a line up or such terriﬁc jazz artists Mer-
cury's Caravan won’t soon be forgotten in Pitts-

burgh.

Letter‘ To The Editor

In the Tuesday, March 23, edi-
tion of the Pitt News, an article
was printed concerning, Paul
Steinlauf, former IF social chair-
man, and his successor Jim
Greany. I I

In it your reporter not only dis-
torted the facts, but managed to
paint an- unfair picture of Sten-
lauf’s record, neglecting all men-
tion of the outstanding successes
of the IF social calendar. What
mention was made of the Kickoff
Dance, the open houses and pro-
gressive dances of the football
season, and the largest’ and most
successful IF winter formal ever
presented to fraternity men. Your
reporter neglects the good ‘points
of Steinlauf’s record“ to bring out
his questionable failures of last
semester. The reporter’s lack of

ing in view that the Bonﬁre Rally

Council, and not the sole respon-
sibility of one man.

Again, the Pitt News is guilty
of printing hearsay and Tuck Shop
gossip, not the facts gathered from

the competent authority. I saw no
oﬁicial quotes from the president
of IF Council or any ofthe mem-
bers of its executive committee.
The words “is reported” in them-
selves, followed without names,
are enough to make anyone stop
and take with a grain of salt any-
thing that follows. Steinlatifs res-
ignationi came about solely be-
cause he and the executive com-
mittee could not see eye to eye on
the quota and the effects of re-
ducing it. His past record had
nothing to do with the resignation.
He should be commended for
his excellent record and services

at the last regular IF meeting.‘

room and orchestra without con-
sulting one member of IF social
committee,” Steinlauf asserted.
“They ‘decided to call the meeting
late Monday evening (March 9)
for a meeting at 9 a.m. Tuesday
morning. I was unable to attend
because of class commitments, and
couldn't get in touch with any of
my committee on such short no-
tice.”

Steinlauf protested that he did
not know about the executive
committee’s actions until late
Wednesday afternoon.

The former social chairmanalso
tookzexception to the article ap-
pearing in the News following his
resignation.

Steinlauf thought that “there
was an error in the reporting of
suggestions and, I think, in the
 of the article through ref-
1-.'ence.to ‘ﬂascos’ in describing

 3 allygan otheraifairs."

Dickey -Asks
Relaxation

Of Comp Ban

Forces brew yet in the compli-
mentary ticket question pot.

Bob Dickey, chairman of Stu-
dent Congress social committee,
reported last Tuesday that dance
committees were sidestepping Stu-
dent Congress’ rule that no com-
plimentary tickets be issued for
student dances.

Dickey suggested that it would
be best to ignore these violations
at present since the present law
obviously needs modiﬁcation.

He suggested instead that dance
committees be required to submit
lists of the social committee's ap-
proval of people it wished to re-
ward with complimentary tickets.

“You don’t have to know the language,”——but it would help
if you are going to attend the Sigma Kappa Phi open house, Tues-

Spring Festival Entertainment
To Feature Prizes. Surprises

The usually staid atmosphere of the Shadyside district will be‘

enlivened on the evenings of May 4 and 5, when the Pitt Spring
Carnival takes over Ellsworth Center Field.
It will be a true old-fashioned carnival, complete with bright
lights, sawdust, barkers, sideshows, ﬁreworks, and games of chance.
Crowds along the midway will discover a variety of things to
keep them entertained both evenings, as the fraternities, sororities,

and other campus organizations¢

dress up the event with their
booths.

There will be prizes galore for
all persons attending the Carnival.
Besides the initial door prize to
be given to each person, ample
prizes will be.’ awarded to those
displaying their skills at the vari-
ous booths.

In line with the “Nationalities”
theme of Spring Festival, attrac-
_tions will range from a French
cabaret to a “hit Joe Stalin” base-
ball throw.

The carnival will open May 4
with the disbanding of the Float
Parade at Ellsworth Field and the
awarding of trophies to the win-
ners. T

One of the highlights of.the car-
nival will be the King T-Tip con-

test, a combination of Miss Hush
and the Lemac Man.

The climax of the contest will
come on May 5, when the lucky
student who decides who King
T-Tip is, will be rewarded for his
efforts.

Students Aided
By Willkie Funds

NEW YORK, N. Y. (AP)—A
donation of $38,000 to Indiana
University to establish scholar-
ships in memory of Wendell Will-
kie was announced here on the
birthday of the late Republican
presidential candidate.

According to Oren Root Jr.,
1940 chairman of the Associated
Willkie Clubs of America, the
funds were left over from the ac-
tivities of that organization.

Mr. Root stated that the schol-
arship grants decision was made

Dr. H. C. Carlson is reportedly
laying in a store of survival ra-
tions to keep his basketball Cara-
van alive next winter.

The Pitt coach is not only plan-
ning to convoy his floor squad
through the South again over the
Christmas vacation but also hopes
to lead a safari of Panthers to
California between semesters.

They plan to stop on the way
now and then to replenish the
water supply. They’ll probably
take on some of the local competi-
tion during the lay—overs.

With these voyages in mind,
Carlson began work Monday
‘teaching 30 ball players the in-

tricacies of his fundamental sys-
tem, the ﬁgure-eight offense.

Pitt’s coaching doctor and his
assistant, Tay Malarkey have a‘
big teaching job ahead of them

‘Sarge’ Combs Squad
For New Leftfielder

By Myron Kopelman

Left ﬁeld is the Achi1le’s-‘heel of Pitt’s 1948 Pitt base-
ball edition. If Coach Ralph Mitterling can produce just one

a good bet that Pitt is on its

Way to another winning season. ,
The left ﬁeld post is the only position that must be ﬁlled

last season’s leftﬁelder and lead-
off hitter, has transferred to
Youngstown College.

At the moment, the race for
the job seems to be between Frank
Papariello, Ed Valencik, and Bim-
'bo Cecconi. Papariello, a product
of South High in Pittsburgh, has
been playing with the LA squad
and has the edge so far.

He bats and ‘throws from the
left side, but if Mitterling chooses
to combat southpaw pitching with
right handed batting he can call
on Valencik, a rookie from Glass-
port. _ V ’

Little Cecconi, who turns up
wherever there is an athletic con-
test of any, type, rates only an
outside chance for the leftﬁeld
job.

Bimbo has a lot to learn about

wealth of natural ability, it is

unlikely that Mitterling will cut
him from the squad. ' ‘

Johnny Gennock’s absence in
the outer garden is expected to be
felt hard both on offense and de-
fense. Gennock, a mature and ex-
perienced player, could field and

Snyder hit .360 last season and

only catch to such a situation
would be that the outﬁeld would
then bat unanimously from the
right side. ,

Such a shift would also mean
that Mitterling would have to
gamble with an untried shortstop.

Seems Dim as
Opener Nears

By Bob Van Atta

Fourteen lettermen will pro-
vide an experienced cast of
track men for Coach Carl Ol-
son ’s dual meet inaugural with
Ohio University at the Sta-_
dium, Tuesday afternoon, Ap-
ril 20. Unfortunately, the meet
conﬂicts with the Forbes Field
baseball opener.

Most of the other performers
have at least a year of varsity ex-
perience behind them. This is the
ﬁrst campaign since the war in
which freshmen are banned from
varsity competition. One of the
‘greatest crops of incoming fresh
track "prospects suffers by re-es-
tablishment of the rule.

Four Home Meets

The four home meets carded for
the Stadium include Ohio Univer-
sity, Wayne, Western Reserve, and
Miami (Ohio). Penn State at State
College is the lone dual attraction

on_ the road. .

Herb Douglas, referred to by
Olson as “one of the nation’s ﬁve
best broad jumpers” and the ci_ty’s
leading Olympic track prospect,
will fortify the team in four
events.

Herb is the leading high jumper
and sprinter. Lettermen Gene
Heide and Bill Morton back up
Douglas in the 100 and 220. In
addition, Alan Brennﬂeck and
Clarence Crawford are looking
good.
Doak In Quarter .

Brennﬂeck, Morton and Heide
also rank in the quarter-mile be-
hind Clarence Doak. Letterman
Jay Nielson and
Sam Camp han-
dle the half-
mile.

Wilkinsburg’s
Jack Hender-
son,Neilson,
Bill Carp, and
Sam Camp , are
the lads who
will pound the
cinder t r a c 1:
over the mile
and two-mile distances.

Three letter-winners should be
heavy point-scorers in the hurd-
ling events. Bill Raney,.undefeat-
‘ed in dual meets last year, Doak
{and hard-working Evan Kisick
’ comprise the trio. ‘

‘ Kisick Versatile .

Dave Christopher, Brentwood
sophomore, is top man in the dis-
cus and shot put, with competi-

 

Mor on

grid halfback Bobby Lee has ex-
changed the pigskin for the discus.

Kisick, Thomas and Doak com-
pete with Douglas in the broad
lump, but high jump prospects are
not as good. The versatile trio of
Kisick, Thomas and Douglas jump
for altitude.

Letterman Joe Haller leads Lou
Kish and Kisick in the pole vault.
Two freshmen, Bill Valentine and
Al Yedlicka, will make this a
strong point, but not until nex
year. .

 

Football continues to be the top
sport at Pitt as far as number of
candidates is concerned. Gridiron
candidates numbered 168, bas-
ketball 53, track 23, swimming 29,
and cross country 37.

Marks Grid  Practice

By Max Scherb_
In spring, though other young men may turn their fancies
to thoughts of love, a football coach looks toward the prob-

lems of theacoming season. At
they really get one.
All Mike Milligan has to

Pitt, when they get a problem,

do by September 25, when the

season opens, is get more weight¢
-on the small men, meat off the

huskies, and make ends out of

guards. In between, he’ll have to

ﬁgure a we to teach them how
to play football.

A free-for-all ﬁghtfor all po-
sitions is on tap. According to the
coaching staff
no one has an
inside track on
any position.
Especially in-
teresting are
the battles for
fullback and
center.

Four candi-
dates are in the
race for full-
back. Bill Ab-
raham, return-
ing after a year's layoff due to in-
juries, is back. Lindy Lauro, very
much improved and Gus Rader
who had some tries at the. job
last year, are in the "running.
Freshman John Vrable also looks
good. '

The center battle has three
veterans, all lettermen, striving
for the slot. Len Radnor, Don
Fisher and Lee Ward covet the
job. In addition freshmen Stein-
graber and Radosevich are in the
muddle. '

The biggest improvement over
last year is being shown by the
candidates for the tackle position.
The actions of Mike Boldin, Sam
Haddad, Bob Plotz, Bob Mihm
and Nick Bulkovic have given

Radnor

the coaches something to grin

about. ,

Milligan and his staff have been
stressing fundamentals for the
past two weeks. Most of the time
in spring sessions is spent by the
coaches -in teaching the gridders
the ﬁner points of their positions.

Scrimmages began Monday.
From now on, more time will be

. spent in body contact. Next week,

the entire squad will put in about
an hour a -day mauling itself."

P°KA's Defend
, l ‘ . ‘
Softball Title
Approximately 45 IM softball
nines start Monday in quest of
honors which defending cham-
pions PiKA are favored to retain.

Joe Muller’s key performer, pitch-
er Corky Larson, is the reason

for optimism among the titlehold-

ers.

The strongest frat competition
may come from the Phi Eps. Pitch-
er Bruce Gilbert, who last year
hurled a no-hitter against Alpha

‘ Phi Delta, is still around.

The Bus Ad Economics, runner-
up to P_iKA last spring, have suc-
cumbed to “supply and demand”
and will have representatives on
two Bus Ad aggregations for this
campaign.

Bob Kane’s powerful independ-
ent organization, the Locals, ex-
pect to ﬁeld a strong contender.
The Locals lost both the football

. and‘ bowling ﬁnals to PiKA,' and

are anxious to turn the" tables for
obvious reasons.

Battle Prices

COLUMBUS, Ohio (IP)——Stu-'
dent wives at the Ohio State Uni-
versity have landed the ﬁrst blow
in the opening round of the bat-
tle against high prices-—a cooper-
ative bargain exchange bulletin
titled “The Dollar-Stretcher,”
listing the cheapest buys in town
in half a dozen family necessi-
ties, including food, clothing and
children’s wear.

The bulletin lists bargains dis-
covered by Dames’ members in
an exhaustive telephone shopping
tour and gives prices and Stores
where the best buys are available.
Oﬁicials of the group point out
that any merchant who can oﬁer
a lower price than available any-

ly the office of the dean of women
which has helped the Dames

abhor the chattering and shriek-

The ﬁrst Pittsburgher to learn
that Dr. John B. (Jock) Suther-
land, coach of the Pittsburgh
Steeler football team, was found
wandering in a Kentucky ﬁeld,
apparently an amnesia victim, was
H. E. Daer, assistant bursar at

Upon going through personal
papers found on Dr. Sutherland a
Kentucky attorney phoned the
University first. After hearing the
story Mr. Daer switched him‘ to
the Steeler oﬁice. Mr. Daer said
that the caller gave no particular
reason for contacting Pitt rather
than the Steeler management.

Apparently some people in Ken-
tucky don’t keep up on their foot-
ball. Otherwise they would have
known that Dr. Sutherland left
Pitt in 1938 following disagree-
ment over athletic policy. 7 A -

Concert Band
Puts Together
Varied Recital

Theatrical lighting effects and

programs of diversiﬁed music
mark the “new” University con-
cert band.

It made its 1948 debut last week
in Bellevue with a departure from
regular concert presentations.

Conductor Robert L. Arthur ex-
plained that musical productions
are being developed to suit audi-
ences of varied tastes. The band
has complete symphonic instru-
mentation.

Musical numbers will range
from the best symphonic, through
semi-classic and light opera to
currently popular tunes and mili-
tary marches. Solos, duets, and
speciality routines will be staged
in each concert.

The band is playing for various
non-proﬁt organizations in metro-
politan Pittsburgh. Bellevue and

A Avalon were on the schedule last

week.

Tonight at the Carnegie Music
Hall in Duquesne, the orchestra
will perform for the third time
this season. This performance is
sponsored by the Duquesne Wom-
en’s Club.

|FDeba+e Teams To Meet  

Conclude Tournament Series

Seven fraternities joined Saturday in a debate on the question:
Resolved: “That the Federal Government Should Require Arbitra-
tion of Labor Disputes in all Basic Industries.”

Nine Greek Outﬁts origmaiiy entered the tournament, but the
Stray Greeks and Alpha Phi Alpha dropped out leaving Delta Tau
Delta, Phi Epsilon Pi, Pi Kappa Alpha, Pi Lambda Phi, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Sigma Alpha Mu, and Theta Chi inthe competition.

At 10 a. m. the men representing tne various fraternities as-
sembled in Room 347 where they were assigned opponents, rooms,

and judges for the first round. The
debate is scheduled to run as a
“round robin” tournament with
every fraternity affirmative com-
peting against every negative. Last
series of the tournament will take
place tomorrow at 10 a.m.

After the ﬁrst round, which

ended at about 11 a.m., the meet 7

adjourned until 1 p.m. to give the

teams time for revision of their

arguments.

Affirmative and negative of in-
dividual teams discussed their ﬁrst
round to give the opposite team in
their own frat an idea of what
they might expect in future
rounds.

At the conclusion of the last
round Fred Robie, Men’s Debate
Coach, assembled the debaters. He
pointed out general weak points in
both affirmative and negative ar-
guments but commended all par-
ticipants on their attitude and ﬁne
spirit. ‘

No decisions were given in the
debates so that teams are in the
dark concerning their showings. It
was decided by IF Council that
points counting toward the IF All

Point Trophy should be given to’

the winning frats.
