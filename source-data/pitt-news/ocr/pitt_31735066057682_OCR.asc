Bill says publicize police reports better

By John B. Moore
Asst. News Editor

The Pennsylvania Senate
passed bill number 638 on
Monday, which requires all
university police and security
departments to provide public
access to daily logs.

If signed by Gov. Robert
Casey, the bill would take
effect 90 days after that date.

“I think it’s safe to assume
he will sign it,” said Casey’s
deputy press secretary, Bob
Fisher.

Fisher_said the bill hadn’t

reached the governor’s desk
yet, but would be reviewed
within 10 days by Casey and
his staff once he returns from
Philadelphia. ‘

The bill, which passed unan-
imously, amends the six-year-
old College and University
Security Information Act
which required institutions of
higher education to provide
students and employees with
information relating to crime
statistics and security mea-
sures.

According to the bill, “The
campus police or campus

security officers of each insti-
tution of higher education
shall develop and maintain a
daily log as a public record.”

The bill states the entries
should be chronologically
recorded in a manner that can
easily be understood.

Also added to the bill, ‘‘All
entries in the daily logs shall
 be public records available
without cost for examination
and inspection during regular
business hours and at all other
reasonable times.”

Freshman Council revamped for effectiveness

By David Saliba
Staff Writer

For 11 newcomers to the
University of Pittsburgh, the
sixth ﬂoor of the William Pitt
Union is a haven where golden
opportunities and leadership
come together to form the
Freshman Council.

A branch of the Student
Government Board, the

Freshman Council has been
restructured in order to pro-
vide a more efficient and bet-
ter organized system.

“I’ve been up here for sever-
al years, and the previous sys-,
tem was not effective,” Ross
Pasquale, president of the
SGB, said. “Elizabeth Mania
and I went to a conference at
Texas A&M, and they have a
very structured system.”

Though the center was originally proposed in
1980, a number of administrative changes in the

on an application and inter-

When Eric Davin
began work on his doc-
toral dissertation eight
and a half years ago at
"Pitt, he quickly found
himself entangled in a
bitter fight with the FBI
over restricted docu-
ments.

Since 1992, Davin
has been suing the FBI
in order to obtain docu-
ments of the Workers
Alliance of America, an
organization that repre-
sented tens of thou-
sands of unemployed
workers during the
Great Depression and
which has now been
defunct for over 50

years. .
Two weeks ago, and
V eight years after

Davin’s original law-
suit against the FBI,
U.S. District Judge
Gary Lancaster
reviewed 25 pages of
documents and heard
testimony from FBI
agent Robert Moran,
and then ruled that it is
legal for the FBI to
withhold and censor
thousands of docu-
ments pertaining to the
Workers Alliance.
“Even though, in the-
ory, the Freedom of
Information Act says,
‘People should have
access,’ [the FBI] does
not really know how to
act in a climate of
openness,” Davin said.
Davin began work on
his dissertation in 1986

themselves, but most impor-
tantly, for their class and

All in a days work

Pitt SGB President Ross Pasquale says making sacrifices is a challenge

By Stephanie Wright
For The Pitt News

Every political group experiences
some form of backlash, and its leader
is usually the target of criticism. For
Ross Pasquale, president of the
Student Government Board, “it’s just
the way it is,and you have to accept
it walking into this office.”

Pasquale, a fifth-year senior, start-
ed with SGB as a board member in
1992. In his fourth year ,he ran for
president on the platform of an open
student government and won.

He ‘delegated the nine-member
SGB to a. number of student groups.
Each board member became respon-
sible for maintaining open communi-
cations -between the students and the
SGB.

”I wanted [the students] to feel like
they knew someone,” he said.

Pasquale is a psychology major
taking 15 credits. His day begins on
campus at 8 a.m. His routine of
returning phone calls, writing letters
and attending meetings keeps him on
campus until 9 p.m.

Making sacrifices is a challenge,
according to" Pasquale.

“I like to have some kind of free-
dom and flexibility,” but he said he
sees it as his job. “I represent 14,000
[students]. If I don’t show up, people
will be glad to say that students don’t
care.”

Pasquale said running for president
of SGB was a great experience, but
he’s not interested in politics.

“I think politics is just a filthy
arena. It’s really sad that campus pol-

leadership honors society, and
he’s associated with the Pitt chan-
cel1or’s diversity working group,
and a freshmen studies computer
trainer.

For Pasquale, the SGB is a vital
part of ensuring students a good col-
lege experience.

“You can’t assume that administra-
tors know what the students need at
Pitt. The students are living this

“You can't assume that administrators know what
the students need at Pitt. The students are living this

every day.”

— Ross Pasquale

itics are as vicious as they are.”

Pasquale also said he thinks it’s
involvement, not popularity, that
matters in an election.

“You need to know a lot of people,
and it’s not enough to do it during
the campaign.”

According to Pasquale, involve-
ment made his years at Pitt a positive
experience. He’s also the president
of Omicron Delta Kappa, national

every day.”

He said the students need to‘

make the administration aware of
what’s being done right as well as
wrong.

Pasquale did admit the student
government is limited because of
time. A ’ ~

“It’s unrealistic of anyone tothink
that they will change or influence
14,000 people.”

He said that the changes SGB
makes are on a smaller scale, but
they do affect student life.

Contact between the students and
the SGB is very important to
Pasquale. “Students should come up
and talk to me, or any of the board
members. For us to be good at our
jobs, we have to be in touch with stu-
dents.”

“I don’t want [SGB] to be per-
ceived as a rubber stamp for the
administration,” Pasquale said. He
added that his biggest job is to nego-
tiate between the students and the
administration. L

The power of the student body is

something Pasquale knows well. 

“The students are the life of the uni-
versity. You can’t shut them up.”
Pasquale said students need to be
talked to on a financial level because
it’s their main concern.

With his college career coming to T

a close in the spring, Pasquale
said he wants every student to leave
Pitt with memories of a good experi-
ence. R

“I think the university is going

upward, and I would recommend

anyone going to Pitt.”

council members.

“A goal is to try and make it
a smoother transition for next
year’s freshman class,” coun-
cil member Tim Bruns said.
“Getting [students] going in
the university as well as in the
city of Pittsburgh.” A

Bruns speaks from first-
hand experience. A native of
New York state, he was
“dropped off” in Pittsburgh
and became very lost begin-
ning his college career in a
strange city. Through his
experiences, he has learned
and wants in one way or
another to educate those unfa-
miliar with the area.

“If there is someone like me
who was sort of dropped off
here and knows nothing, it
would be nice for them to
have some knowledge of the
area. They might feel a little
more at home,” Bruns said.

Competition and basic inter-
est is what drove these stu-
dents to apply for a position,
but now that they are together
as one group there is an air of
comraderie among them.

“Initially, I applied because .

of interest,” council member
Ryan Riehle said. “We’ll be
good as a group, it’ll be fun.”

Council member Ken
Greenberg agreed. “I wanted
to dive right in and meet peo-
ple.”

“I wanted to meet and work
with people who had the same
qualities and interests as me,”
council Business Manager
Mary Moran said. The leam-
ing experience and knowledge
that comes from being
involved in a committee such
as Freshman Council is anoth-
er factor that initiated interest,
according to the council.

“It’s an experience, and I
think anybody is qualified to
be in the position we are in,”
said Kate Freed, vice presi-
dent. The words that describe
the anticipation of the upcom-
ing year for these council
members are “historic,”
“busy” and “exciting.”

It is a new start for these
young students, and they have
the energy and the motivation
to make great strides for their
fellow classmates.

“If any [student] sees this in
the paper and they recognize
any of us walking to class or
on the street, stop us,” Billips
said. “Tell us what you think
needs done. We are represen-
tatives of the freshman class.’’

This type of enthusiasm is
exactly what SGB member
Deena Buchanan, liaison to
the Freshman Council, was
looking for.

“I think we have such a mix
of. experience,” Buchanan
said. “They are just running
with it, they are wonderful.”

‘This is something that is
going to last for as long as the
university lasts,” Billips said.

The rest of the Freshman
Council consists of Jocelyn
Cortese, Amy Achenbach,
Andrew Surloff and Erin
Belotti.

David Lasser. However, the organization kept no
records of its meetings or activities, and the vast
majority of its membership is publicly unknown.

The FBI possesses the only known source of
information on the group with over 6,900 pages of
documents, Davin said. He said the FBI told him
the documents are composed of transcripts of tele-
phone conversations, intercepted mail, notes infor-
mants had made, copies of brochures and inter-
views with members of the group.

He said it is disturbing that the FBI would not
release its files in their entirety because the docu-
ments have historical value.

“It is a goldmine of information, especially since
there are no other papers on this organization,” he
said.

When Davin first asked the FBI for permission to
review the documents, few pages were given. In
April of 1992, Davin filed a lawsuit against the FBI
because he said he received only 1 percent of the
files. ~

Following the lawsuit, the FBI gave Davin 2,900
pages of the 6,900 documents, but he said they
were all heavily censored. In addition, the Worker’s
Alliance disbanded in 1941 when World War II
boosted the economy, yet the 2,900 pages Davin

received all pertain to FBI investigations after
1941.

Typically, Davin said, large sections of the pages
were blacked out.

“They’d have a copy of a letter, and the letter
would say, ‘Dear Blank.’ And then the entire page
would be blanked out, and then at the end it would
say, ‘Sincerely Blank,”’ he said.

In the early summer of 1994, Davin sued the FBI
to force the agency to justify its withholding of the
remaining 4,000 pages and the censorship of the
rest. The FBI turned 500 pages of documents over
to a U.S. District Court, but the case was postponed
because the material would have been too over-
-whelming for one judge to review.

Subsequently, Davin and his counsel, Reed,
Smith, Shaw and McClay, chose 25 pages for Judge
Lancaster-to review, which was done two weeks
ago. At the hearing, Lancaster ruled that informa-
tion pertaining to the Workers Alliance may be
withheld from the public because the Freedom of
Information Act allows for exemptions if the mater-
ial infringes upon a person’s privacy (and there is
no privacy right for the deceased).

Davin said he received permission from Workers
Alliance president Lasser, 92, to obtain files on him
and the organization.

Yet other members of the organization may not be
dead, testified FBI agent Moran (Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, Sept. 26). However, the FBI does not
investigate to determine if people in their files are
alive or not.

Davin said these policies place the public in a
catch—22 position. Because Davin does not have

. access to the files, he can not determine who the

members of Workers Alliance were, he said.
“We can’t prove that they are dead because we
don’t even know who we are supposed to be after,”

he said.
I Davin said he is appealing Lancaster’s ruling to

- the United States Third Circuit Court.

“And if they turn us down, then the next step
beyond that is the United States Supreme Court,”
he said. . p '

Davin said he and his lawyers are excited to take
the case to a higher court because it may have rami-
fications on the interpretation of the Freedom of
Information Act.

“Actually, it goes much further than my little
case. It has implications for totally rewriting the
law on the Freedom of Information Act,” he said.

An FBI official said the agency does not com-

ment on cases with pending litigation and cannot I

make a statement now.

Holey is right

Leon Haley, the vice chancellor for Student and Public
Affairs, pulled an article on a same—sex wedding from the Sept.
29 issue of the University Times. This has caused a storm of
protest, calling the action censorship, including an article by the
Pittsburgh Post Gazette which castigated Haley. The Pitt News

I feels this protest is unwarranted and Haley was completely justi-

fied in his decision.

Haley speaking at Tuesday’s Faculty Assembly meeting, stood
firmly by his decision, explaining his reasons for withholding
the article from publication. The University Times has a policy
of not covering private events at Heinz Chapel, including the
highly attended funeral for Senator John Heinz in 1991 and last
month’s memorial service for victims of USAir Flight 427.

Furthermore, Haley said the article would have violated Pitt’s
non-discrimination policy. The only reason to report on the cere-
mony would be because the participants were gay. Haley argued
that reporting on the event would have violated “the individuals’
right to privacy because of their sexual orientation.”

Leon Haley’s actions were perfectly correct and in no way
constituted censorship. The Pitt News understands how one
could have initially interpreted his actions as such. But now that
the story is seen in its full light, we believe Haley deserves an
apology from all those who accused him of censorship.

Big Brother in NYC

“The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers,” or, for Mayor
of New York City Rudolph W. Giuliani, let’s fire them and
make sure they never work for the city again. That, strange as it
may seem, is what Giuliani threatened to do to a group of strik-
ing lawyers. ,

The lawyers returned to work yesterday without a contract,
and the mayor said he would not pay more than a 2 percent
wage increase.

The lawyers of the Legal Aid Society of New York, who rep-
resent 60 percent of the city’s indigent cases, were striking in
demand for a 4.5 percent pay -raise. They are looking for an
equal raise to the one their supervisors gave themselves.

For Giuliani, this represents the front line in his battle with
city unions over pay raises. Giuliani cites the severe fiscal crisis
in New York as necessitating a denial of all pay raises for this
year .

The striking lawyers are not actually city employees, which
allowed them to strike, and are instead paid by the Legal Aid
Society, a non-profit organization. However, the majority of the
Legal Aid Society’s funds come from the city. Giuliani does not
feel that he can afford to allow the lawyers to receive a pay
raise, believing it would seriously hurt his negotiating position
with city unions.

It is not the place of The Pitt News to comment on the correct
fiscal policy for the city of New York. However Mr. Giuliani’s
excessive and totalitarian threats, to prevent the lawyers from
ever working for the city again if they do not give in, is need-
lessly provocative as well as a highly questionable use (abuse?)
of power. ‘

Article shows anti-greek bias

One of the fundamental creeds of a journalist
is This or her duty to remain objective when
reporting a story. The language a journalist
chooses to use must be carefully chosen in
order to eliminate bias and opinion from a
story. ‘ 7

Erica Glasspool’s Oct. 3 article, “Greek 101
Educates About Alcohol” does not do this. The
piece contains the line “The event, held in
David Lawrence Hall, featured tables filled
with hats, mugs, sweatshirts and any other
accessories that a pledge’s new Greek letters
could be slapped onto.”

Whilethe choice of the word “slapped” may
be entirely unintentional, this would be far from
the first time that an underlying negative tone
could be detected in an article by The Pitt News
concerning Pitt’s Greeks.

Opinions of this nature have every right to
be, and are consistently printed in The Pitt
News (Tuesday’s editorial, “Homecoming Is
Outdated” is one example), but a little objectiv-
ity in straight news stories is greatly needed.

My intro to journalism book says: “Editors
and other newspaper employees can express
their opinions in editorials and columns, but not

in news stories. Newspaper reporters are .

expected to be neutral observers, not advocates
or participants.”

This is a fundamental rule of journalism.
When The Pitt News overlooks biased state-
ments, it fails in fulfilling its duty of providing
fair, objective reporting to the campus commu-
nity.

SGB president on vofingdrive

Dear editor,

I am writing in reference to
The Pitt News article of Oct. 4,
1994, “Students register to
vote with the Student
Government Boar .”

Your attention to this four-
day event is much appreciated,
but I wanted to take the oppor-
tunity to provide clarification
concerning the name of the
project and its source.

“Register Once” is a nation-
al event occurring Oct.) 4
through Oct.7, 1994 at nearly
500 colleges and universities
throughout the country. It is a
national campaign for student
voting rights organized by the
Lead or Leave Foundation of
Washington, D.C. Lead or
Leave is the nation’s largest
non-partisan, grassroots orga-
nization for young people,

with 130 chapters in all 50
states.

“Register Once” represents
SGB’s initiative on a national-
ly sponsored project and its
growing relationship with the
Lead or Leave Foundation.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Ross Pasquale

President Student Government
Board

SGB voter drive shows partisians/rip

After a painful and unsuccessful search at the
library and the post office (both of which are
supposed to be government document reposito-
ries) for a voter registration form, I was thrilled
to find out that the Student Government Board
was holding registration at the student union.
So of course, I merrily jumped up to the table
and gleefully said, “I’d like to register to vote.”
The girl at the table looked thrilled at the
prospect of having something to do, and even
volunteered to fill out the form for me, with me
reciting the necessary information. When she
asked me my political affiliation and I firmly
responded “Republican” I noticed a slight hesi-
tation. OK, fine. It was better than the obvious
grimace I usually get, so I ignored it. I realizel
am part of an apparent minority,_ so I’m used to
such things.

Today the SGB moved to a more visible loca-
tion. Hopefully, people will see it and take the
opportunity to do what every person over 18
SHOULD do —— register to vote. However, I
finally was pushed over my tolerance limit
when I noticed that, surrounding the signs call-

ing for students to register, were signs scream-
ing “Wofford 94.” The SGB should be ashamed
of itself for allowing such obvious bias to creep
into what could and should have been a great
service to the university community. I almost
wish I would not have registered through their
organization so they couldn’t include my form
in their statistics.

Regardless of my political affiliation, I don’t
think such blatant bias should be allowed to be
part of an activity like this. If the SGB wanted
to campaign for a particular candidate, they
should do so INDEPENDENTLY of voter reg-
istration. Stunts like this keep people who do
not agree with those particular politics from
registering. If those signs would have been
there yesterday inside the union, I would have
kept walking and found somewhere else to reg-
ister. Candidates aren’t allowed to campaign at
the polling places, so why should the SGB be
allowed to support a particular candidate at reg-
istration areas?

St. Francis
7-O yesterday

By Brett F ondrk
Staff Writer

What a difference a year can
make. Last season when Pitt
played St. .Francis, Jeff
Porter’s overtime goal proved
to be the winning one as the
Panthers squeaked out a nar-
row 2-1 win. This year, Porter
didn’t score, but almost every-
one else did as Pitt stomped
the Red Flash 7-0 at Pitt
Stadium last night.

“Last year was a real diffi-
cult time,” coach Joe
Luxbacher said. “Tonight, we
just jumped on them early, and
everything just seemed to
come apart for them.”

Six different Panthers had
goals, including two by senior
midfielder John Lopus.

Lopus spearheaded the four-
goal first-half onslaught as he
scored the first goal oflthe
contest by beating Red Flash
goaltender Brian Wirtz to the
top left corner.

“The ball just appeared in
front of me,” he said. “I didn’t

Wirtz and the St. Francis (2-8)
defenders seemingly bewil-
dered.

In fact, St. Francis appeared
to be in shock the whole game
as the Panthers methodically
dismantled the Red Flash
defense.

“We scored a few goals, and
they just got down,”
Luxbacher said. “It was a
momentum thing.”

And the momentum never
shifted as Pitt poured it on
after Lopus’ two strikes. Brett
Stezoski, Knut Saeter, J.L.
Gorsin, Charlie Wasson and
Eric Prex all chipped in with
goals while the Red Flash
defense fell apart.

By the seventh goal, which

.. was scored by Prex, the

slaughter had clearly affected
Wirtz, who bobbled a routine
ball which led to a veritable
tap-in by Prex. The play was
typical of the kind of evening
that the Red Flash had.

“They’re not as bad as they
looked,” Luxabacher said.
“They only lost to_Penn State

and they usually give us trou-

Piﬂ"s run defense will face Big East's best

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

The task is to stop a very
potent running game. Your
defense has one weak point -—
stopping the run. What do you
do?

That is the job at hand for
coach Johnny Majors and his
Panthers this Saturday at
Syracuse.

“Syracuse is an improved
football team,” Majors said.
“They are executing better on
offense than they did this tim
last year.” ‘

Execution is the name of the
game for the Orangemen.
Syracuse leads the Big East in
rushing offense averaging 206
yards per game. They are also
second in the conference in
scoring offense with 29.8
points per game.

“They have speed on
offense,” Majors said. “Their
running backs are speedy and
effective.”

The two backs Pitt must stop
in order to win the game are
senior Kirby Dar Dar and
sophomore Malcolm Thomas.
In their last game against high-
ly touted Virginia Tech, Dar
Dar rushed for 108 yards and
three touchdowns, and Thomas
ran for 145 yards with one TD.
Both totals were season highs
for the two backs.

Against the Panthers,
Syracuse will in all likelihood
run the option, which has eaten

Pitt alive in the past. Senior
quarterback Kevin Mason is
third on the team in rushing
with 101 yards on the season.
Mason is also the leader in
passing efficiency in the Big
East.

“Syracuse will challenge us

to improve our responsibili-
ties,” Majors said. “Particularly
in the option game, everybody
being assigned to the proper
people to cover the pitch. The
option is very effective in col-
lege football.”

The task of stopping this

high-powered Syracuse offense
falls on a battered and bruised
defense that ranks second to
last in the conference in halting
the run. Pitt is allowing oppo-
nents 196.4 yards a game rush-
mg.

“We have to avoid big
plays,” junior defensive tackle
Mike Halapin said. “The small-
est, dumbest mistakes, whether
it be taking a bad angle or
missing a tackle, are costing
us.”

To make the plays on
defense, Pitt needs some
injuries to heal quickly. Junior
linebacker Tom Tumulty (foot)
and sophomore defensive back
Denorse Mosley (shoulder) are
listed as questionable ‘for the
game.

One man who ishealthy and
has made a big contribution to
the defense is junior linebacker
Jason Chavis. Chavis is cur-
rently second on the team in
tackles with 52, including a
team—high 32 solo stops. He
has also recovered two fumbles
and collected two intercep-
tions.

“If we make a mistake,
they’re [opposing running
backs] going to have a good
game,” Chavis said. “It’s all
about us being a little more
mentally sound.”

The statistics do pile up
against the Panthers. Under
head coach Paul Pasqualoni,
Syracuse has a 8-0 record

The Pitt News, Thursday, October 6, 1994

Pitt linebacker Simpson destined to play football

By Keith'Pompey
Senior Staff Writer

Today in the world of sports,
one hears of several athletes
who have battled back from
injuries. But Pitt’s newest
strong safety Gerald “J”
Simpson’s story is out of the
ordinary.

Battling-back from three

' knee injuries, the 6-foot-3-

inch, 2l5—pound senior is a
walking success.

It all started back in 1988.
During that year, Simpson was
considered one of the finest
scholastic prospects in the
country, he was a SuperPrep
All-American and first team
All-Northeastern defensive
back as a junior at Warren G.
Harding High School (of
Warren, Ohio). Going into his
last season, Simpson, who was
named to the 1989 Streets &
Smith’s preseason top 50 list,

’ almost lost his dream his of

playing collegiate ball.

“He got injured the second
game of that senior year,” said
Gerald Simpson, Sr. “He tore
his interior cruciate ligament.”

After Simpson’s injury, the
Warren Tribune Chronicle said
he would never be able to play
Division I football. In its view,
Simpson would never regain
his athleticism.

However, with the help of a
knee specialist, “J” disregard-
ed the Tribune’s words, using
them instead for motivation.

“He really didn’t go in a
deep depression,” his father
said. “He was down for a
moment, but he was ready to
come back. He was determined
more than ever to come back.”

As Simpson regained his
strength in his knee, Dr.
Goodfellow wrote to various
universities, telling of his
patient’s improvement.

During that year, he signed
with Pitt. Still recuperating
from major knee surgery,
Simpson enrolled only as a

part—time student.

“It was frustrating,” Simpson
recalls. “First they said I
couldn’t play Division I. Then
I get here finally, and then it is
like I have to sit out. I was
watching everybody play. To
sit out another year, that was
real hard.”

After a year of playing on
special teams, “J” was back in
the limelight in 1992. But this
time he was a linebacker, a
position he hated.

“When they first switched
me, I didn’t like it because I
never played linebacker in my
life,” he said. “I only weighed,
at the most, 200 pounds. I had
to take on people weighing
375. I went up against people
with Rube’s [Brown] type of
talent.”

His lack of weight didn’t
hurt him. Starting in all 12
games, he ﬁnished third on the
team with 66 tackles, 2 sacks
and 2 pass deflections.

His biggest game of the year

came against West Virginia.
On that day he recorded 10
tackles.

“That was a big game for
me,” Simpson said. “It was
like a rival game.”

Not happy with his amount
of tackles, Simpson decided to
master his position.

“Since I wasn’t used to the
linebacker position, I stayed in
Pittsburgh and watched film all
summer,” he said. “I did every-
thing I thought that would
make me a better linebacker,
since I had a lot of defensive
back in me. That whole sum-
mer I did a lot of linebacker
type drills _at the stadium. I
came into the season pre-
pared.”

As the I 1993 season
approached, his teammates
expected great things from the
Ohio native.

“You take a coveted defen-
sive back as fast as he is with
the ability to make big plays
— I was happy to have him,”

linebacker Tom Tumulty said.
“I was real happy. We ran the

-4-3 defense, and he was the

outside backer.”

Racking up 14 tackles
against Southern Mississippi in
the first game of the season
last year, it looked like
Simpson was well on his way.
But tragedy struck again. This
time in a game against Virginia
Tech.

“I had a ‘good Southern
Mississippi game,” he recalls.
“Then I came into the next
game pumped up. I was ready
to have a big season. I think it
was the fifth play of the game.
I recovered a fumble, and one
of my teammates hit my leg,
and they messed up my knee.
That following Monday, [the
trainers] told me I had a partial
tear in right exterior cruciate
ligament.”

Suffering another knee
injury, Simpson missed three
straight games.

Upon his return, he roamed
the field like a man possessed,
finishing fourth on the team
with 65 stops. He also led the
team with 6 tackles for a loss.

This year, he hurt his knee
once again, but this time dur-
ing the first game of the sea-
son. Fortunately for him, it
was only a minor sprain in his
right knee. He only missed one
game. 5

“It wasn’t sense for me to
rush back during the Ohio
University game,” Simpson
said. “We got a long season.”

Last week, Simpson saw a
dream come true when he was
switched back to his natural
position. In the contest against
Louisville, he posted 11 tack-
les.

“It doesn’t seem like he had
an injury to slow him down,”
offensive tackle Reuben
Brown said. “It is just like he
kept on playing at his level.
You obviously could tell that
he was hurt a little bit. He is
still fighting through the pain,
but he’s straight.”

'Cuse LB
Conley is
”an old-
fashioned
Pittsburgh
guy”

By Sean Duncan
Asst. Sports Editor

Syracuse linebacker, and gut
of the defense, Dan Conley
possesses two of the most pro-
found numbers in all of college
football — nine and six.

Conley, who grew up in
Carnegie, Pa., redefines the
term “chronic” when it comes
to injuries. He has undergone
nine, count ‘em nine, surgical
procedures on his knee.
Consequently, Conley missed
two seasons, his sophomore
and senior years, and was
granted a rare sixth year of eli-
gibility by the NCAA.

“The fact that he’s come
back through all he’s been
through,” Syracuse head coach
Paul Pasqualoni said, “it gives
you the indication of the true
competitor this guy is.”

Talk about seniority.

“He’s an old guy,” Pitt center
Lawson Mollica, who is a
fifth-year player, said jokingly.
“Six years is a long time. It
just proves that he loves to
play the game.”

And that he does. After his
last reconstructive surgery
which caused him to miss last
season, he was unable to go to
school because his major, envi-
ronmental design, required
him to constantly be on his
feet. That is why the NCAA
gave Conley a sixth year,
which makes him one of six
collegiate players to have it.

“We were happy for Danny
and the football team that we
had another chance to be
around him," Pasqualoni said.

This year, the 6—foot—2-inch,
245-pound inside linebacker
picked up right where he left
off, just like the eight other
times he’s been injured.
Against Cincinnati he~led the
team with 20 tackles, and he
gave an encore performance
when he tallied 18 stops
against Rutgers.

Conley’s story isn’t just
about a man of perseverance,
it’s about a man with incredi-
ble talent, too.

“There’s no question, he’s a
great player,” Pasqualoni said.
“He has uncanny ability to get
off a block very quickly and
get to the football. He sees
things and feels things on the
field.”

Pasqualoni believes that his
linebacking prowess has some-
thing to do with where Conley
was raised.

“He’s an old-fashioned
Pittsburgh guy,” Pasqualoni

Dar Dar, Thomas offset weak passing attack

By Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

If one is a firm believer in
the value of statistics, the
Syracuse/Pitt game looks like
a fairly even contest.

Both teams are at the top of
the heap in the
Big East in
rushing, at the
bottom in pass-
ing, and
entrenched in
the depths of
the cellar in total defense.

However, there is one tell-
tale aspect of the opponents
that doesn’t show up on the
stat sheets, the overall records.
Syracuse is 4-1, and Pitt is 1-4.

“We feel very fortunate to be
where we are right now,?’
Syracuse coach Paul
Pasqualoni said. “We realize
that we could be 1-4 as well as
4-1.”

The Orangeman got to 4-1
by upsetting then 10th-ranked

SYRACUSE

I - 8-7 - 0

 

Virginia Tech 28-20 at the
Carrier Dome. The come-
from-behind win propelled the
Orange to a No. 21 ranking
which is their highest of the
season.

Syracuse trailed 20-14 with
less than eight minutes to go
but pulled out the win when
they ran against the Hokies
late in the game.

“We were able to get a long
run by Kirby Dar Dar and
another one by Malcolm
Thomas at the end of the game
that gave us the needed
points,” Pasqualoni said.
“Then the defense was able to
go out and stop them.”

Dar Dar, a senior, had a
career-high 108 yards and
three touchdowns en route to
being named the Big East
Conference Offensive Player
of the Week. Thomas added
145 yards of his own as the
Orange shredded the vaunted
Hokie defense for 278 yards
on the ground.

“We had tried to throw the
ball against Virginia Tech last
year and got humiliated,”
Pasqualoni said. “We felt that
if we were gonna have a
chance to be in the game, we’d
have to run the ball.___We were
just fortunate to hit a couple
on them.”

Running the ball is nothing
new for the Orange. They lead
the conference in that depart-
ment as they are churning out
an average of 206 yards a
game. Dar Dar leads the team
with 388 yards, and Thomas is
a close second with 373.

The glaring weakness of the
offense is at quarterback.
Senior Kevin Mason has never
been mistaken for Marvin
Graves. He leads the confer-
ence in passing efficiency, but
that stat is misleading as he
only has 79 attempts.

“Kevin is starting to settle
down a bit. Early in the year
we didn’t protect the passer,
and we dropped and tipped

some balls,’’ Pasqualoni said.
“Kevin was struggling a little
bit. I think that he feels more
confident right now because
the team is playing better. I
think that he’s a little more
comfortable.”

The top receiver is junior
Marvin Harrison who has 14
receptions for 361 yards. He is
a viable big-play threat who is
averaging a stellar 25 yards a
catch, including two touch-
downs. Last season, Pitt saw a
lot of Harrison, mostly the
back of his helmet as he
torched the Panther secondary
for 128 yards including touch-
down catches of 37 and 64
yards.

The defense, which most
will remember for stopping
Pitt inside the 5-yard line on a
fourth and two to seal the
Orangemen’s 24-21 victory
last year, has been the most
scrutinized area of the team

this season. Besides a 34-19

win over of Cincinnati, the
three other victories have been
decided by an average of four
points. The Orange are last in
the conference in total defense
as they are surrendering a
whopping 433 yards a game.
The strength of the unit has
clearly been the strong play of
inside linebackers Antwaune
Ponds'and Dan Conley. Ponds,
a redshirt freshman, is leading
the team in tackles with 71.
Conley, a Butkus Award candi-
date, is in a rare sixth year of
eligibility that was granted
because of an injury that kept
him from attending classes. He
has 62 tackles including a sea-
son-high 20 against
Cincinnati, despite playing
only part time and missing the
entire East Carolina game.

Last year, Syracuse defeated
the Panthers 24-21 at Pitt
Stadium. Besides Syracuse’s
41-10 blowout in 1992, the
last four meetings between the
teams have been decided by

seven points or less.
Pasqualoni expects no differ-

Conley has every one of

Head coach at the time, Don
McPhearson, immediately rec-
ognized Conley’s ability as a

went on to start all 13 games
and led the Orangemen in
tackles with 126, 70 of which
were unassisted. He led the
team in stops eight times and
sacked the quarterback five
times, which earned him hon-
orable mention All-Big East.

type of billing that he was get-
ting then — and he did. He
was really good. Probably one
of the best linebackers I’ve
ever faced.”

His sophomore season,
Conley was off to a torrid pace
when he recorded a season-
high 17 tackles the opening
game of the 1991 year. But he
went down with a season-end-
ing knee injury in the second
game against Maryland.

Still not fully recovered
from his knee injury his junior
season, Conley was listed as a
Butkus Award candidate,
which goes to the top line-
backer in the country. He
missed three games after re-
injuring the same knee, but
finished the season as the sec-
ond-leading tackler on the
team with 71.

He missed all of last season
due to injury, and here he is,
with all of his grittiness, abili-
ty and most importantly, his
attitude.

“You got to understand,”
Pasqualoni said, “I was his
position coach four or five
years ago. I love the guy to
death.

“He’s the type of guy, when
he walks into a room, the
room is going to shine
brighter. He’s the guy you’re
going to love the first time you
talk to him.”

From the kid from Carlynton
High School, to the man who
needs 18 tackles to enter
Syracuse’s top 10 tackling list,
it has been a long painful jour-
ney. But one thing is certain
when Conley steps on the
field: the opposing players had
better be ready to play, or they
will feel the true agony that he
has felt throughout his almost
mythical football career.

goalie Kirk Brodows, who
pitched the shutout. Brodows
spent much of the game play-
ing the role of spectator as the
Pitt defense kept the Red Flash
in check.

“I give our guys credit,
because I thought that we
played good team defense
tonight,” Luxabacher said.
“We haven’t done that all year.
We got back to our basic iden-
tity as a team, and that is
strong defense first. We kind
of got away from that, and
that’S something that we want
to get back to.”

Brodows also credited the

play of the defense and felt
that the win was important,
especially with a conference
game against Seton Hall loom-
ing only three days away.
V “We stepped up tonight,”
Brodows said. “We’re trying to
gear up for a big game this
weekend. We needed to score a
lot of goals. Hopefully after
this, things will star-t coming
together.”

By the 11:00 mark of the
second half, Luxbacher had

when it rushes for 250 plus
yards in a game. When an SU
back runs for 100 plus yards,
the Orangemen are 7-0-1. And
when Syracuse scores 30 plus
points in a game it is 16-0. To
beat them you have to hold
them down.

“We have to stop the run,”
Chavis said. “As a defense you
have to take it personally, it’s a
slap in the face. Any team that
can run on you is going to run
on you.”

“Dar Dar is speedy, but any
time you practice against a
Billy West and a Curtis Martin
you are not gonna see anything
better than that,” Chavis said.

Stopping the running game is
not only a task for the
Panthers. The Syracuse
defense must step up and slow

down Billy West who leads the
conference in rushing with
128.6 yards per game. Pitt’s
rushing offense is second only
to that of Syracuse.

“If we can take what we did
last week and build on that,
then I will be even more
pleased,” senior center Lawson
Mollica said. “I don’t think
anyone has ever played a ﬂaw-
less game, but we need to play
as close to ﬂawless as we can,
and if we make a mistake it
can’t be a critical one.”

“Pitt could be 4-1 just as eas-
ily as 1-4,” SU head coach
Pasqualoni said. “They have a
good bunch of guys back. Billy
West is a great, great back.
We’ve got to be ready for a
very difficult Pitt-Syracuse
football game.”

The Orangemen are led

defensively by linebackers
Antwaune Ponds (71 tackles),
Dan Conley (62 tackles) and
free safety Tony Jones (53
tackles). In the conference,
Syracuse is last in total defense
giving up 433.4 yards per
game.

Last year Pitt lost a heart-
breaker 24-21 to the Orange.

“This year more than ever,
everyone seems to be on the
same page defensively,”
Halapin said. “We all know
what the defense is designed to
do and where we fit in it. That
was a major problem the past
couple of years.”

“This year’s team is a year
smarter and wiser,” Chavis
said. “This year we do believe
we can win, whereas last year
it was like, ‘I hope we can stay
in the game.”’

hen one tries to imag-
ine what the average
stripper must be like,

the image of an overtanned,
melon-breasted, bleary—eyed
woman probably comes to
mind. She snorts coke, turns
tricks on the side and is a lost
soul — a woman with no direc-
tion who exhibits her body for
dollar bills. She has given up
faith in herself and therefore
turns to a profession which
requires nothing more than the
willingness to appear almost
nude in a public venue. An
outsider may think, “How could
she do that? Has she no self
respect?”

Because of these various
stigmata, I hesitate to discuss
my profession with most peo-
ple, though I myself am not
ashamed of it. I am only secre-
tive in order to spare myself
from being unfairly judged. But
when it comes down to how I
really feel about it  well, I’ll
tell you.

I don’t mind what I do. In
fact, I like it. Stripping has
always had a lurid sort of
appeal for me. In my early
teens, my fascination was set
in motion by movies such as
“FIashdance” and videos on
MTV in which go-go girls were
featured. They seemed to be
so in-control, hot, bad—as-hell,
bathed in the spotlight, taut-
bodied, lip-licking. They were
making cash. They were
strong, slick—skinned creatures
who wove their lithe bodies

around brass poles. Men
looked up to see them. These
men were dumpy and power-
less in comparison.

My vague fantasies of
becoming an exotic dancer
were still intact when I came
here to Pittsburgh at the age of
eighteen. I decided to to go to
an “amateur night” that was
sponsored by a local agency. I
convinced another curious
friend to go with me, and we
headed for the remote subur-
ban strip joint in a taxi.

When the two of us walked
through the door, we were
greeted by the whine of a
generic heavy metal guitar
solo. The men sat in a threat-
ening line on their bar stools,
staring us into the ground. I
mumbled a few words of regret
to my friend, who appeared as
distraught as I was. A woman
in a g-string and stilettos was
pressing her breasts together
right under a man’s nose. She
had glittery things on her nip-
ples. I wondered why she
wasn’t using the stage; she
was just shimmying directly up
to these men as they sat at the
bar. The man she was dancing
for now could have licked her
breast if he stuck his tongue
out a quarter of an inch. I
wanted to leave. I wondered if
the cab was still outside. Just
as I was thinking this, we were
greeted by a muscleman in a
white tank top, who directed us
to a tiny, weakly—Iit dressing
room.

Mevies were his passion.

Wemen were his inspiration.

Angela sweaters were his weakness.

As I sat there, pressing flow-
ery stickers onto my nipples
and listening to the quick, rest-
less chatter of my friend, I was
still unaware of what I would
be in for. I pulled the borrowed
g-string shakily over my hips
and faced myself in the mirror.
I quickly appraised my shape
(average, a little on the heavy
side), then headed for the bar.
My nervousness was height-
ened by the sound of the
mens’ catcalls.

That, my first stripping expe-
rience, did not net me a job. I
was told I was too heavy, my
hair was too short and that I
danced too fast. It took me
another year to muster the
courage to do it again, and I
still wasn’t hired. On my third
audition (a circus-like amateur
night at a downtown venue), I
was hired. For anyone who is
interested in doing this, the
key to winning an amateur
night is to pack the audience
with your friends so that you
get the most applause.

Since that fateful night eight
months ago, l’ve been a go-go

girl, stripper, exotic dancer,

burlesque entertainer, whatev-
er you wish to call it. But
before you get stars in your
eyes, I’d like to let you know
that there is very little glamor
in this life. The reality is one of
damp dressing rooms, fatigue
and pasties that won’t stay on.
I also have to deal with being
propositioned almost every
night. I have talk to these lone-

CONFESSIONS OF A GO-OO OIRI. 

Iy, insecure guys, most of
whom are sporting thick,
bejewelled wedding bands.
They tell me about their lousy

their fantasies~(which may or
may not involve me). So, I’m
basically a scantily clad thera-

described to you is an after-

bar after his nine-to-five grind
and sits there all starched and

the crowd starts to turn over.
Then the bikers drift in, along
with the laborers and college-

them into some sort of frenzy.

me, ask me to bare my crotch

and ask to buy my socks. Yes, .
they want my dirty sweat- _,

The very worst, though, is
when a bachelor party comes
in. It seems like they all get

It sounded like a ridiculous
pairing: Windham Hill, the noo-
age label responsible for that
exciting-as-watching-grass-
grow music, signed the Jazz
Passengers, one of the most
creative and humorous post-
jazz groups to emerge from
the Knitting Factory.

What do they want with the
Jazz Passengers? Will the
New York sextet sacrifice their
chops and chutzpah for the
ability to eat well after years of
meager living?

Doubt it.

Besides, I exaggerate a little
bit. The Passengers actually
hooked up with High Street, a
subsidiary of Windham Hill,
which has a pretty good track
record.

And the group sounds about
as close to selling out as I am
to buying a Kenny G album.
(Which, believe me, ain’t in the
cards.)

Instead, they took the sign-
ing as a chance to utilize a big
budget for a step in a different
direction. Their previous
albums featured trombonist
Curtis Fowlkes and saxophon-
ist Roy Nathason stepping up
to the mike on a track or two.

features vocals on all 15
tracks, with an array of guests
lending their voices to the pro-
ceedings.

We’re not talking the 173rd
version of some worn-out big
band tune, either. (Although I’d
like to hear what these guys

could do to “| Got A Gal in T

Kalamazoo.”) Members of the
band penned the music, and
the lyrics were provided by
monologist David Cale and
playwright Ray Dobbins.

Some of the music sounds
steeped in tradition, coming off
like a logical extension of the
Mr. Ellington. Other times,
things go wild and the band
flies all over the place. But in
both situations the lyrics make
sure things stay toward the
absurd.

“My agenda,” Nathanson
said, “was really always to
connect a certain kind of
downtown surrealist theatre —
the kind of character-oriented
stuff that Charles Ludlam used
to do in his Theatre of the
Ridiculous —- with jazz or
modern music or whatever you
call our music.” The attitude
prevails in their music now as

much as it did when the
Passengers formed in the late
‘80s.

Fowlkes and Nathanson met
when both played in Big Apple
Circus and, later, the Lounge
Lizards. At that time, the
Lizards also featured guitarist
Marc Ribot and drummer E.J.
Rodriquez. Lizard leader John
Lurie didn’t provide enough of
an outlet for the chops of his
bandmates, so the two horn-
men started performing as a
duo. Eventually Ribot and
Rodriquez joined up, along
with violinist Jim Nolet, bassist
Brad Ware and vibist Bill
Ware.

As the Jazz Passengers,
they sounded like a lounge
band with Tourette’s
Syndrome. The frontline of
‘bone, sax, violin and guitar
was enough of an indication

ool craz loge cats tking tTrain, iTJazz Pangers.

that something unusual was
blowing on. if they started out
along the same trail as other
like-named groups (the Jazz
Messengers and the Jazz
Crusaders), they took a wrong
turn at Lenox Avenue.

The rhythm section provided
a nice foundation, smoothed
out by Ware’s lush vibework.
But compositions featured dis-
sonant horn parts blasting into
the foreground. And if Ribot
took a solo, whoa Millicent.
You’d think his guitar got stuck
under a lawnmower.

Since 1987 the band has
released five albums, three of
which came out domestically.
A few featured a couple tracks
with vocals, which often serve
as a red herring for the cats
who didn’t. think the
Passengers could calm down.
Implement Yourself concluded

with Fowlkes’s gentle reading

of Cole Porter’s “Easy To .

Love” with nary a squonk in

Last year’s Plain Old Joe
album showed they had more
in mind than a straight croon.
The title cut was a snappy little
number that complemented
the gruff little guy on the cover,
who looked like some chap
who would sell you wholesale
fruit in the Bronx. In their take
of ‘‘If I Were A Bell,” Roy and
Curtis remained faithful to the
basis of the Guys and Dolls
standard, while tossing the
original lyrics out the window.

For Jazz Passengers in
Love, the band got some out-
side help from vocal luminar-
ies ranging from Deborah
Harry to jazz warbler Bob

Ed Wood

Directed by Tim Burton

With Johnny Depp, Martin
Landau

and Sarah Jessica Parker

Hollywood, U.S.A. early
1950s: Edward Wood Jr.
(Johnny Depp), the cross-
dressing 30-year-old failed
playwright from Poughkeepsie,
happens upons an elderly,
eccentric morphine addicted
Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau)
and begins his career as a
filmmaker and cult king of
kitsch-soaked, low bugdet, B-
movie madness.

When Wood gets in the door
of one hack producer who’s
looking to make a story about
a sex change, things get hairy
and hilarious as the young
Wood begs, borrows and
steals to produce his first fea-
ture. “ls there a script?" Ed
asks the pastrami-slurping pro-
ducer. “No, but there's a fuck-
ing poster,” and Wood pulls
“Glen or Glenda” off with a
half-ass crew that includes a
colorblind cameraman, stock
footage and props stolen from
real studios and a half-dead
Lugosi as his miscast star.

Burton’s “Ed Wood” is as
much a multi-faced farce as
his hero’s own real-life films.
“Wood” gets tossed in the
genre blender as Burton bor-
rows every B-movie conven-
tion to tell this tall tale of 503
Hollywood. The cast of charac-
ters get clad in low-key noir
lighting and fifties camp.

Wood’s girlfriend is the bud-
ding starlet Delores Fuller
(Sarah Jessica Parker) who’s
at odds with Eddie and his
growing entourage of “weirdos
and drug addicts,” highlighted
by the screamingly funny
aging ex-drag queen Bunny
Brackenridge (Bill Murray).

Burton delights in sight gags
detailing the numerous hoops
Wood had to jump through in
order to make his films. Wood,
always comparing himself to
Orson Welles, comes off as a
ridiculous but lovable fool
made good by the even
greater foolishness and pre-
tense of Hollywood and his
affection and care for the
elderly Lugosi. Bela turns out
to be a kind of redeemed
Norma Desmond in this film.

You can bet every film critic,
bright boy and probably even
Tim Burton himself will ponder
the parallel between the man
routinely referred to as “The
Worst Filmmaker of All Time”
and Hollywood’s current king
of matinee weird, Mr. Burton.
Sorry, but there there ain't
none. Burton’s too legit.

Ed Wood’s appeal is in his
hopeless inability to be legiti-
mate and the resulting struggle
just to produce any film comes
out here as the real reason
Wood would make such a
mindnumbingly goofed opus
as the infamous “Plan 9 From
Outer Space.” Burton can't
know such trouble. He’s
pawned off his talents to the
studios for some huge pay-

Stephen King’s tale of free-

to ask of one movie. “The

spins the story without an
excess of sloppy sentiment.

Andy Dufresne (Tim

never committed. From the
moment Dufresne and the

Southern Fried Rock

- This summer, the family and I, drove
through Raleigh, North Carolina and I
said, ''I wondered if Merge Records is
aroun' these here parts." Southern
dialect always fascinated me, but the
music even more. N.C.'s and Merge
Record's Polvo will be using
Pittsburgh as a stepping stone for their
tour. Their latest EP "Celebrate The
New Dark Age" confused WPTS DJ's.
Some wetted their pants from fright of
the dagger-like guitar noise and the
others said, "That's cool!" DJs, can
you really trust them? Whatever? local

noise demi-gods, Don Caballero will be-

bring their chaos to the underworld of
Pittsburgh's indie-rock, ears. They'll be
battling with electronic music pioneers,
Revo. Describe by a local as, "the
future of our sounds", I guess it means
it's the future of our sound. With both
bands playing, who will win?
Shiny Beast will be opening the
musical war that will end all wars. It's
TONIGHT! TONIGHT! Bellefield Hall.

to look high and low for that

A man wearing a blue busi-
ness suit with a briefcase in
hand peered into a glass case
filled with skull rings and orna-
mental jewelry. His briefcase
rubbed against the tattooed
leg of a man with enough body
piercings to set off a metal
detector. Both men stood side
by side soaking up the vibes in
Slacker, where ‘‘cool’’ is the
hot thing for sale.

Slacker, a true-to-life “dream
merchant,” sells everything
from clothing and bondage
gear to tobacco pipes and
nose rings. Nestled in
Pittsburgh’s throbbing cultural
artery, the South Side, Slacker
has become a mecca for any-
one in the market for the out-
of-the-ordinary.

Years ago, Randy Przekop,
the 27 year-old owner of
Slacker, was pounding the
pavement in New York City as
a picture-perfect punk. He
candidly said, ‘‘I had the black
hair, black nails, leather jacket
and boots,” describing his pre-
Slacker appearance. While
punking around in New York,
Przekop was exposed to

lay io-ac:-I-Inca-‘I
I(ers-I-inng

numerous stores selling such
items as steel-studded leather
jewelry and sadomasochistic
apparel, the basic things one
just will not find at the local
mall.

After moving to Pittsburgh, a
light bulb clicked in Przekop’s
now neatly groomed head. He
realized that he missed those
quaint little stores in New
York, so he decided to open
his own store full of unusual
goodies. “Besides,” said
Przekop, ‘‘I needed a job.” He
took the bull by the horns and
tried to open a shop in
Oakland. It did not work out,
so Przekop set up shop in the
South Side with greater suc-
cess. Slacker’s opening made
such alternative stores as
Avalon shake in their boots
according to Przekop.

Slacker has kept Przekop
from becoming a slacker. His
hands are full running the
helm of his store. If Przekop is
not shuttling through the store
keeping track of customers, he
is attending to the cash regis-
ter. Stack this on top of the
everyday responsibilities of

owning your own business,
and you have a man who is
continually on the run, even
with assistants.

Enter Pam Markle, a hip 23
year old with a zeal for retail.
She is the proverbial “queen of
cool” with her red, lush lips
and “shoot from the hip” atti-
tude. Mark|e’s hairdresser rec-
ommended the job to her. She
helps customers with their pur-
chases, telling them if that sil-
ver skull pin heightens their
already striking image. Maybe
a set of earrings to match?
Yea or nay, customers trust
her opinion.

Colorful days are the norm
when your clientele ranges
from doctors to cross
dressers. It is amazing to see
such a wide range of people
feel right at home and not give
one another so much as a
second stare. Stepping into
Slacker, stereotypes that peo-
ple normally seem to hold
against one another are some-
how left at the door. Markle
was quick to note that being
around so many different peo-
ple all the time has “really

enhanced” her social life.
What a bonus.

Things are not always so
peachy. Every once in a while,
around 11 p.m. to midnight,
drunks from the local bars
have been known to stop in
and harass the employees.
Przekop has been able to
keep these dolts under control.
He admits that a lot of people
walk by and stare in the win-
dows with curiously frightened
looks on their faces. Przekop
and Markle simultaneously
said, “Yeah, and we just stare
right back.”

A store of Slacker’s nature
may scare or even offend our
more close-minded com-
padres. People see the pro-
fane T-shirts, black leather
clothing and exotic jewelry
then instantly think something
evil or, even worse, something
illegal is going on behind the
doors. Slacker, in essence, is
no different than a Kmart.
They are both in business to
sell goods and services to the
general public. Instead of hav-
ing a “blue light special” on
lawn furniture or motor oil,
Slacker may have a special on
water pipes or bell bottoms.

There seems to be no limit
as to what Slacker has for sale
on its shelves. Just about any-
thing goes when “cool” is your
commodity. They have made a
killing supplying the Pittsburgh
area with large doses of coun-
terculture. Before Slacker went
into business, you would have

special leather whip or pair of
chrome-plated handcuffs. Now
they -are easily accessible in
the heart of the South Side.

Tapping Pittsburgh’s cultural
vein, Slacker is a feeding fren-
zy for a generation overloaded
on becoming more and more
bizarre. Where else can you
plunk down big bucks for nose
and lip jewelry? You will not
find that stainless-steel stud to
fill the pierced hole in your
tongue at any old jewelry
store.

The South Side is a prof-
itable place to own a business,
according to Przekop. He is
one of the pioneering “alterna-
tive” business owners in the
South Side. Przekop said that
all of the businesses along
East Carson Street feed off of
one another. Some guy may
shoot by Arabica for a quick
cup of “joe” and then realize,
as he sips his coffee, that he
could use a new corn cob
pipe. He makes a pit stop at
Slacker for the pipe, and on
the way out sees a cool book
on reincarnation in the esoteric
information center, The Eye of
Horus. He buys the book and
calls it a day.

So, you want a new tobacco
or water pipe? Slacker can
cover the demand. They have
a stunning array of pipes, but
do not be stupid and ask for a
nice “Mary Jane” bong.

Curtain Up!
(An overview of Pitt Theater’s
1994-95 Season)

Stacked with controversy
and variety, Pitt Theater’s
1994-95 season officially
begins this weekend with the
preview of Jeffrey, by Paul
(Sister Act, Adams Family
Values) Rudnick. This OBIE
award winning comedy has
been praised by Time maga-
zine as “a wonderful comedy
about a rancid tragedy.” lt fol-
lows the uncertainty of a gay
waiter in Manhattan who gives
up sex, rather than deal with
dating in the AIDS infected,
raped—of-innocence ‘90s. With
a little help from his friends,
Mother Teresa, and a cast
member from Cats, Jeffrey
looks at difficult social ques-
tions with a sense of humor.

The Three Cuckolds takes
the chill out of a Pittsburgh
November with former Pitt
Professor Leon Katz’s version
of a formerly improvised,
Italian Renaissance comme-
dia del/’arte. Using theater
techniques which have
inspired people from
Meyerhold to Stravinsky, the
performers will try to pull the
devil into the Studio Theater.

Just in time for Valentine’s
Day, Chemin De Fer opens to
offer its love-as-a-game analo-
gy (is it Battleship or Twister?)
in the form of Feydeau’s clas-
sic French comedy. Directed
by W. Stephen Coleman, its
amusing look at commitment
turns the season of hearts and
flowers on its ear.

In 1978, San Francisco
mayor George Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk were
brutally murdered by Dan
White, who was only convict-
ed of voluntary manslaughter
as opposed to murder.
Execution of Justice, by Emily
Mann, closes the season with
this explosive story, using
some actual dialogue from the
case, of justice in modern
America. Following a year of
daily televised trials and shat-
tered preconceptions about
the judicial process, this pro-
duction strives to make us

toned and Dethroned
Jesus and Mary Chain
American Recordings

Jim and William Reid, the
Scottish brothers who comprise
the soul of the Jesus and
Mary Chain, have been living
the past ten years in the hell of
a super—consumptive pleasure
drive. Through their twin
muses, Sex and Drugs, the
brothers have midwived four
full-length albums and more
than an album's-worth of sin-
gles, describing, through their
not-all-that-foreign eyes, the
beautiful, thumping heart of the
American Dream. With influ-
ences centering around
American demi-gods of rock
(See “Bo Diddley is Jesus”
from the Barbed Wire Kisses
collection), and the European
pop and punk traditions, the
Mary Chain spawned an entire
generation of mostly British imi-
tators and protégés, from the
bland atmospheric dribble of
forgotten faces (The High), to
the inspired evolution of the
Chain’s music in bands who
are now influential in their own
right (My Bloody Valentine,
Galaxie 500).

One group whose Mary
Chain inspired style is currently
gaining widespread appeal in
America is Mazzy Star, whose
opiate Doors-drone master-
piece “Fade Into You” can be
heard most any time of day on
college radio or MTV. The door
swings both ways, however,
and Stoned and Dethroned, the
Jesus and Mary Chain’s fifth
full-length album and legal
proof that they are the most
worthy heirs to the Velvet
Underground’s crown of nee-
dles, is first cousin to Mazzy
Star in a conspiracy of the neo-
American Junk Rock zeitgeist.

Keith Richards must be shiv-

ering in his blood as he sits

under the naked light bulb in
his cold kitchen, pressing
repeat on his CD of Stoned
and Dethroned. The less-than-
platonic relationship between
the guitars, always the central
element of a Mary Chain
recording, drop into the listen-
ers gums and swish around for
a moment, numbing everything
in a heroin—blues “Exile on
Mainline” whitewash before the
despair of the scantily clad
lyrics drop into his eyes and

nose. The words are so
sparse, on some tracks such
as “Feeling Lucky’ totaling less
than 20 words a song, as to
initially seem passable.
However, it is the sparsity and
simplicity of the lyrics which
give them their malleable
framework and their spirituality.
Even at the most damning
moments of desperation, such
as in “Everybody I Know”
(Everybody I know/ Is Falling
Apart/ Everybody I know/
Wants to Die/ Wants to Find),
the very nature of the song, the
dreamy, escapist music and
the stray lyrics, bordering on
insubstantiality, gives rise to
the possibility of discovery, the
possibility, through the burden
of excessive pleasure, of
escaping pain. The price is
dear, however, including the
probability of losing all ties to
the outside world, whether that
be good or bad. (“We've got
nothing but that's alright,”
“Scream for me baby cuz I’m
going down/ Got to get to
Heaven when the sun goes
down.”)

The music is typical Mary
Chain three-chord pop—blues,
but they have, for the fifth time
in five records, changed the
way in which the music is
broadcast. Beginning on
Psychocandy, with an encaged
chaos of noise and feedback,
the Chain moved on to intro-
spective acoustic melancholy
on Darklands, to aggressive,
untethered Euro-rock on
Automatic, and combined them
all on Honey’s Dead. Now, in
the yet unsettled wake of the
acoustic Rolling Stones and
the above mentioned Velvet
Underground,
country/folk/blues a la opium
derivatives comes into the
Reid brothers’ resumé. The
raw sexuality of their seedy
records, like Psychocandy and
Automatic, is transformed, not
abandoned, into a late night
barroom lament, a “Drugstore
Cowboy” libido, with only
slightly more subtlety.

It would be a mortal sin not
to mention the supporting cast
joining the Reid brothers on
this record. To make compar-

isons easier, “Sometimes
Always,” the first single, is a
duet between Jim Reid and
Hope Sandoval, singer from
Mazzy Star. The song is micro-
cosmic of the entire record, the
insubstantial nature of music
and lyrics, the completeness of
the framework, yet the open-
ended possibility of its narra-
tive. _ 

Perhaps the more interesting
combination on Stoned and
Dethroned is the lead vocal
tracks on “God Help Me" con-
tributed by former Pogues
singer Shane MacGowan.
Previously working with singer
Kirsty Maccoll and Enigma of
the Year Nick Cave,
MacGowan has also been
keeping busy doing sporadic
shows with new group the
Popes. On “God Help Me”,
Shane is the perfect choice,
his drunken semi-brogue
meandering through the
mantra of “God please help me
through this day.” The combi-
nation of Reids and Pogues is
strange, yet somehow
inevitable in the world of hedo-

9

  

nistic consumption-rock.

Overall, Stoned and
Dethroned is another new
move in an old way for the
Jesus and Mary Chain, per-
haps their boldest move since
Psychocandy, now straying so
far from the feedback and
anger which made them music
critic household names. As
usual for the Reids, nothing is
as important to them as them-
selves, and it is easy to guess
that they love this album. It is
the epitome of a Mary Chain
album, it is an American road
movie: it is “Wild at Heart,"
“True Romance” and “Red
Rock West”. They are honest
to God, meat and potatoes,
Natural Born Junkies.

expecting their futuristic,
orgasm-inducing guitar riffs
contrasted by their symmetri-
cally angelic voices, instead I
got The Beatles. Ride has
gone “retro”!ll What a shame! I
feel bad about giving an unfa-
vorable review about my
favorite band. But the truth is
that Carnival of Light is leisure
suits and lost episodes of The
Partridge Family. The album is
too tamed!!! Their once velvety
British accents are now
obscured by prolonged guitar
riffs and bass drum beats.
“Moonlight Medicine” sets the
precedent for an unappealing
trend of sounds. It starts out
with an extrinsic, yet unalluring
touch of a tamboura which
echoes in the background. The
verses are repetitious and bor-
ing. The electric guitar splits
through the song and does not
fluctuate. The only good things
about this song are the vocals
by Andy Bell and Mark
Gardener —— but you can
scarcely hear them because of
the silent-noise that precedes
it. The album is a retrogression
to the days of sunshine bands
and mood rings. Their “new”
sound is old. It is reminiscent
of The Byrds, The Beatles, The
Rolling Stones (in antiquity),
and possibly The Who, which
we have all heard before. ‘It is
hard to distinguish one song
from another. Their voices
never fluctuate except in “How
Does It Feel To Feel,” when
Ride attempts to quicken the
pace a bit but instead sounds
like monotone clamor.
“Birdman” has a Motown-ish
flair that is not at all flattering to
their British dialect. “Only Now”
was co-written by The Beach
Boys’ manager Jack Rieley,
and it drags on like a syrupy
lullaby.

Despite the weak songs on
this album, “Rolling Thunder”
has a strong creative quality
and soul-penetrating reso-
nance. This song seduces

me!!! It is a fantasy-stimulating
instrumental that permeates
through the body. It entails
soothingly hypnotic string
instruments that sway through
the senses like an acoustic
drug. It is definitely a diamond
in the rough in comparison to
the other songs.

I felt betrayed when listening
to Carnival of Light. I was look-
ing forward to Ride’s enchanti-
ng voices and plea%antly
unpredictable instrumentation
but instead I got a bevy of
“whining, British mamas—boys”
and a tamboura. Ride needs to
hop into their “Time Machine”
and cruise back into the pre-
sent; otherwise they will be his-
tory.

Bakesale
Sebadoh
Sub Pop

To be honest, two months
ago I was a little sick of all the
Sebadoh hype and didn’t even
bother to explore what I think
can be considered the band’s
sixth full-length release,
Bakesale. A few weeks ago,
after splurging on the CD only
because the fattest baby I’ve
ever seen graces the cover, I
am regretting all the time I
missed commiserating with the
Sub Pop boys and what is
probably their best effort yet -
even more focused and pas-
sionate than last year’s Bubble
and Scrape. In a temporary
lapse of reason, I must have
forgotten Sebadoh’s ability to
crawl deep into parts of my
psyche no one else could ever
reach. -

Nine of the songs on
Bakesale belong to Lou Barlow
and five to Jason Loewenstein,
with the remaining song being
a Bob Fay creation. This may
be a good time to mention that
drummer Eric Gaffney and his
characteristic abrasive edge
are gone, only to be replaced
by Fay who splits his time
between five, yes five, other

said, ‘‘All he did was put a dol-
lar bill on your ass. Boo-hoo-
hoo-hoo.” I said “Fuck you.”
He then said, “Ya wanna hit
me? C’mon! Right here! Hit
me!” I was really holding
myself back. I wanted to hit
him so. bad, but I knew that if I
did he would hit me back. I
walked off the stage , got
dressed and went home. I
wanted to quit forever, but I
was back at it the next week.
I've acclimated myself to mak-
ing five hundred dollars a
week, and I’m not ready to
give it up. Five hundred bucks
for fifteen hours of work is
pretty hard to beat.

However, there is more to
stripping than catering to
obnoxious men. I do get some
satisfaction out of it: it can be
a nifty little power trip at times.
And I must admit that I don’t
mind being the center of atten-
tion. Also, the nature of the
work has kept my body in
great shape. And I really enjoy
the dressing room chats I
have with my fellow dancers.
They're a tough lot for the
most part, and I don’t exactly
fit in. I do, however, appreciate
and respect them. These

themselves, taking care of
their children and taking
advantage of their strong,
curvy bodies. And I think that’s
pretty smart.

I recently asked a dancer,
who had quit after six years in
the business, what she
thought about being a stripper.
She said, “Here’s all I've got to
say: don’t ever, ever tell any-
one what you do for a living. I
never did. I was very embar-
rassed by it. Don’t ever tell
anyone. They'll never under-
stand. They’ll think you’re a
whore.” I understood where
she was coming from, but
that’s not how I feel. I think
people need to know more
about this industry so that they
do understand. We’re not all
bisexual coke fiends. The girl I
quoted was working her way
through medical school. I’m
working my way through col-
lege.

So, for the moment, this job
suits me. I don’t know how
much longer I’ll do it. I could
get pissed off and quit tonight.
But I know that a part of me
would miss the shimmery g-
strings, the stacks of bills, the
rosy, flattering lights on my
bare skin. Which reminds me,

bands. (Of course, Eric has
quit three times before, so
whether Bob is actually coming
or going has yet to be deter-
mined.) In comparison, Fay is
tighter rhythmically and as a
result, Barlow doesn’t have to
play lead guitar nearly as often,
sometimes opting just to strum
as he aspires to some level of
personal artistic freedom.
The album as a whole, while
indulging in a couple of wel-
come lo-fl moments, is gener-
ally more polished and lacking
Sebadoh’s trademark noise
texture and dissonant guitar.
But not in a negative way, for
it’s the simple melody and the
heart-wrenching feeling of
helplessness added to
Barlow’s deeply personal
lyrics, that propel the album
into the realm of wonderful-
ness.

in the first seven cuts alone,
Lou and Jason take you down
a powerful 10-minute road,
then lapse into a middle
ground and then fall off into
some dreamy spacey land.
Loewenstein’s “Careful,” one of
the album’s most redeeming
moments, is classic Sebadoh
with it’s pleading guitar and
frenzied, desperate vocals. As
he begs, “l just want to do right
by you/sitting safe beside the
truth/beside you,” you can’t
help but feel painfully self
unaware.

Soon after, they slip into

_g“Dreams,” in which the hazy
iguitar eclipses the vocals, but
ithe plea for the simple truth is
§all the same. This is followed
§by “Skull,” a song with oodles
gof single potential, which is
where Barlow starts to get a lit-
"tle flaky. All was going smooth-

as “99   -

ly until Lou started having gra-
nola visions of chasing drag-
ons through the recesses of his
cranium.

Despite “Sku|l’s” bizarre
transgression, there really isn’t
a bad song in the collection.
“Flebound,” is typical up-beat
and catchy Barlow, and when
Lou sings “Confusion turns me
upside down/lost completely as
l’m found,” he describes in one
sentence the mood of the
entire album. “Magnet’s Coil”
wins the award for best lyrics
with it’s line ‘‘It feels good just
to bitch about it/scratch an itch
until it bleeds.”

Interestingly enough, it's only
on the aforementioned songs
(plus “S. Soup” and the lead
off, “License to Confuse”) that
the three members of Sebadoh
actually play together as a
band. And since Sebadoh is
really more a group of individ-
ual musicians than a “band”
anyway, it’s amazing how well
Lou and Jason, the world’s two
most self-diagnosed individu-
als, merge both musically and
lyrically.

There’s no doubt that on
Bakesale, Sebadoh connects
with more lonely, restless and
freedom-seeking hearts than
ever before. And although
Loewenstein definitely crafts
some beauts on this one, l’m
still partial to Barlow. Lou’s
songs in particular evoke real
emotion, and listening to the
album must be something like
being the priest on the dark
other side of Lou’s confession-
al. lt’s a real saintly experience

to be, what will the Jazz
Passengers play when they
come to town this weekend?
You don’t have to be Nat
Hentoft to realize they couldn’t
tour with half the singers who
appear on In Love.

The answer is, it doesn’t
really matter. After hearing any
of their music and schtick
(which go hand in hand), any-
thing they do is enough to get
you to the Craftsman’s Guild
to check them out.

Dorough, whose soulless,
nasal voice once reminded my
sweetie of a mutant cross
between Eugene Chadbourne
and Michael “Popsicle Toes”
Franks. I find it hard to dis-
agree but Dorough really
sounds appropriate in “Ring
the Bell” which he co-wrote
with Ware.

Other songs feature gospel
singer Mavis Staples, Bernard
Fowler (the Stones’s back-up
singer currently saving Mick
Jagger’s ass around the coun-
try), Jeff Buckley and Freedy
Johnston. ....

flick predictability ceases after
this point in “The Shawshank
Redemption,” and the film
unfolds into a story that is
fresh and universal in its
scope.

Instead of remaining a tar-
get of sexual violence for “the
girls” in Shawshank Prison,
Dufresne’s capacity to hope
(the kind that supplies wily
solutions) enables him to out-
maneuver his enemies.
Humorously enough,
Dufresne quietly survives
Shawshank by giving free
banking advice to the Bible-
beating Warden Norton
(“Christ is my Savior. His
Judgement Cometh and That
Right Early.”). The warden’s
financially struggling lackeys
also employ Dufresne’s ser-
vices and set up a full-time
office for him. Bob Gunton’s
schizoid sweaty-nosed por-
trayal of the warden works
well in the film. The depiction
of the prison guards (the lack-
eys) is less effective. Each
guard falls into one of two cat-
egories, Nazi or Dagwood
Bumstead.

Dufresne eventually
becomes a hero of mythic
proportion to the other
inmates because of all he is
able to accomplish within the
confines of the penitentiary.
My favorite example of
Dufresne’s persistence: He
writes weekly letters for six
years requesting prison
library funds and books. He
finally receives a check for
two hundred dollars, “some
spicy and some scholastic”
books and a letter from the
senator's assistant begging
him to not write anymore.

Freedom’s complexity is
another thread in “The
Shawshank Redemption” that
is handled particularly well.
Freedom is not always the
desire of the confined; Brooks
