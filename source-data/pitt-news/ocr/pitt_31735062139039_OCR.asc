BOARD HOLDS
MEETING  

Committee on Student Activi-
ties Holds Session in State
Hall.

 

MILLER IS PRESIDENT

The new Advisory Board on Stu-
dent Activities met Monday night in
State Hall. This Board was organized
by the trustees of the University upon
the recommendation of the faculty. It

. ‘is the object‘ of the organization to

supervise, co—operate and promote all
student activities. It is not the inten-
tion to interfere -in any.manner but
rather to assist and advise in order to
promote such activities. The adjust-
ment of the ﬁnancial affairs will prob-
ably be the greatest problem for the
new board to solve. It is hoped to
formulate a plan to secure advertise-

‘ ment for all student organizations in

‘a budget and thus do away with
bothering the same business man sev-
eral different times. On account of
the responsibilities _and work of this
new body it will probably become one
‘of the most important organizations
in the school. The advice and con-
sultation of all student organizations
is earriestly requested. A combined
meeting of the board and the man-
agement of student activities will be
held in the near future.

This Advisory Board is Composed
of three members of the faculty, three
‘members of the Alumni Association
and three members of the Student
Senate. The members are as follows:

Mr. C. S. Miller, President; Mr. C.

 Murray, :’l4, Secretary; Dr. S. B.

Linhart, Mr. T. R. Williams, Dr. A.
F. Judd, Dr. J. H. McCullough; Mr.
L. J. Affelder, ’94; Mr. W. J. Allen,
".14; Mr. Wm. Smith, ’13.

DR. DAVIS SPEAKS

Dr. H. B. Davis, principal of t-he
Southwestern State Normal School,
was the speaker at the regular School
of Education (chapel) assembly Mon-
day morning. Mr. Davis spoke on

 

the value of Selﬂexpression and in: Hamilton, one of Pitt’s greatest men,

this connection he emphasized the
need of the right sort of teachers to
give inspiration and help in the things
that pupils as individuals are inter-

‘ested.

T0 BLIND SCHOOL A

 

A trip through the Pennsylvania In-
stitution for the‘ Blind was the pro-
gram for the class inISocial Problems
on last Friday afternoon. A complete
inspection of the school was made
and every phase of the work of the in-
sititution was taken in. Dr. Crafer,
who is'the instructor of this class,
had made preparation before hand‘
with the superintendent to take the
class through and every courtesy was
shown the visitors.’

From the point of v-iew of human
interest, it was the best trip ‘the class
has taken this year, according to vari-
ous members of the class,

FENCING CLUB. -

The German Club and the P. A. A.
are the first teams that "Pitt fencers
have met up to the present time.

Last Friday night, May‘31, the meet
was held in Room 107 Thaw Hall. Age
and experience told against the
youthful aspirants and the German
club took ﬁrst honors, with P. A. A.‘
a close second. Instructor Postgate’s

untiring efforts are highly commended.

for getting a team of the excellent
quality displayed from a crowd,of
green material in three months’ time.
The class displayed by the boys shows
that there will be some hotly con-
tested matches next year with the
eastern league, of which Pitt expects
to become a member.

Y. N. 0. A. HOLDSiFlN1lL
MEETING or THE YEAR

The last regular meeting of the Y.
W". C. A. was held on Monday in the
chapeL
ing and spoke on the opportunities
and responsibilities of the college
woman. Miss Frost then gave an ac-
count of Bishop McDowell’s talk on
“Missions,” which he gave at the As-
bury M. E. Church on Sunday even-
ing, June 2. He laid special emphasis
on the great success of missionary
work, and on the tremendous oppor-
tunity and responsibility of the Chris-
tion church on the foreign ﬁelds.

The girls feel that the work of the
association this year has been very

successful considering very unfavor-

able circumstances, but they hope to

. do much better next year, with the

added inspiration of the summer con-
ference. -

FRESHMEN-—ATTENTION!

 

_ The Freshmen will. hold a meeting
after chapel Friday morning. It is
the request that all the Freshmen be
present at the meeting, which will be
held in Room 105 Thaw Hall.

MR.iCHOWEY MAKES ADDRESS

Mr. Paul Clhowey, President of the
Cosmopolitan’ Club, made an address
before the East Liberty Branch of the
Y. M. C. A. on last Sunday afternoon.
His subject was the.“National Awak-

. ening in India.”

 

LE CERCLE FRANCAIS

 

The Cercle Francais held its ﬁnal
meeting for" the year Monday after-'
noon, '»June third. The main feature
of the program was an illustrated loc-
ture on “Paris” by Dr. Harry. The
rest of the time was given over to an
informal tea.

This is the initial year of the Cercle

Francais and it has proved very suc-

cessful, pointing to.bigger things. in
the future.

To Do Practical Work In Vacation Is
Now the Aim of‘ the College Man

In speaking the other day of.the
change in the attitude of the college
man in_regard to the manner of spend-
ing the vacation months, Mr. A. R.

said:

“There was a time when the college
student thought it necessary to spend
the entire summer vacation period in
loaﬁng around and having a general
good time with no thought of doing
some practical work during the sum-
mer months. Time was when the stu-
dent that did any work in the summer
was a conspicuous exception, but
things are,ve1_‘y‘much changed now.
Now the student that ‘does not do
some kind -of work in the vacation
time is the exception to the rule. The
college man has come to realize the

fact that the summer months are too
precious to be allowed to be wasted
in idleness; he has come to see that
the value of going out in the world
and doing some kind of work during
vacation is very great, and, having this
fact in mind, he has gone "out to get
the beneﬁts to be derived ‘from work-
ing in the summer months.

‘.‘In our own Universityithere has‘
been established an employment bu-
reau to secure positions for the stu-
dents of the University in the summer
months, and also to place men in
permanent positions as soon as they
are through school. The fact cannot
be disputed that the college man is
more and more coming to appreciate
the value of some good, every day
knowledge to supplement the theo-
retic principles learned in‘ college.”

Miss McBride led the meet— '

MUSIC BY CHAPEL CHOIR E

The University Memorial Day exer-
cises were held last VVe-dnesday in
accordance with the usual custom in
the banquet room of Memorial Hall._

The hall was the scene of ‘the largest
meeting held there since the Pitt‘
Alumni banquet back in the winter.
Tech students were invited to attend
to hear the speakers of the morning-

PRICE 5 CENTS ,

The chapel choir, under'Prof. Berger, ‘

rendered several interesting selec-
tions in ,harmony with the occasion.
Patriotic songs were sung by the

"combined student bodies.

One of the speakers was Mr. Oliver
McClintock, who said in part:

“It is especially beﬁtting that these
reviews be held in this building.” Then
he gave a very interesting description
of the withdrawal of the Senators
from the National Senate. I

He dwelt up-on the duties of the cit-
izen in time of peace and appealed to
us that we live" with an eye suited to
the building of character. 

The next speaker, Captain Smith,
the patriotic instructor of the Grand
Army of the Republic, said in part:

“I, am proud Qf what the men of
the ‘Civil War have, done since that
time in the work of’ peace.” As a tes-
timony of Dr. McCormick’s character
Captain Smith presented him with the
Lincoln medal of the Grand Army of
the‘ Republic. _ . I

Dr. Riddle was the third speaker
and made the statement that the ﬁrst‘
cavalry ofﬁcer killed in the Civil War
was a studentof the old University.

The concluding speech was made.
by Captain McKee, who recalled
some of the interesting events of the
war.

 

On Memorial Day'Pi Theta Nu en-
tertained a number of its friends at
an outing held in the vi=cinity of Oak-
mont. The affair was a success in
every way. Only those who were so.
fortunate to be present can appreciate
thefull signiﬁcance of this remark.

CHAPEL CHOIR MAKESG _
A HIT WITH TECHITES

The chapel choir sang last Wednes-
day at the weekly convocation and
were greatly appreciated. They sang:
some patriotic selections that were
well rendered. The visitors present
were very enthusiastic in their praise-
of the professor’s choir. — ’

“Entered as second class matter
October 24, 1911, at the Post Oﬂice
at Pittsburgh, Pa., under Act of

THE BLIND SCHOOL

Many of the greatest blessings that
we enjoy are not appreciated by .us
for the simple reason. that we have

'9never been deprived of them for any

length of time and, thus, we have but
a vague conception of their true
value. But if by some :chance we
should be deprived of them we would
quickly realize their true Worth.

One -afternoon last week the class
in Social Problems madena trip to the
Blind School. Every member of the

.class that made the trip came back

with a much deeper sense of What a
blessing it is to be able to see and en-
joy all the beneﬁts derived from hav—
ing this faculty faultless. Visiting
over two hundred people that are un-
able to see and watching them as they
Went about their work left an inef-
faceable impression upon every
visitor.

. Too much credit cannot be given to
the people engaged in -the work of
making the life of the blind happier
by devising systems by -which the
blind may learn to take part in some
of’ the activities of life. 1 By their work
they are making life as broad as pos-
sible for those that must go through
this life in total darkness. ~
