». Women Plan A

To Finish
12th Floor

At a mass meeting of women
students last Friday Miss Helen
Poole Rush, dean of women, in-
troduced a plan by which women
students will raise $100,000 to
complete the twelfth floor.

When'the arrhy moved in two
years ago, women students gave
up their activities floor, but now
that the situation is less serious
there are hopes of returning and
making the floor more complete.

Each girl has been asked to
solicit ten people for ten dollars
each, so that each girl will be re-
sponsible for $100. White tags
will be worn until $100 have been
turned in, and then red tags will
be worn. The girls have been ask-
ed to try to get their quotas done

" by March 4.

The proposed layout of the
twelfth ﬂoor contains conference
rooms, work rooms, dressing
rooms, a check room, quiet rooms,
a roof deck, a kitchen, and a so-
cial room. A drawing room as a
memorial to the late Thyrsa W.
Amos, former dean of women, is
also planned.

The floor has been planned to
uphold the traditions of beauty at
Pitt, in order to augment the
Chancellor’s work. .

S-peakers at the mass meeting
representing each of the four
classes were Betsy Briant, C, Jane
Ambrose, C, Hope Calman, C, and
Dodie Hurrell, C. Lou Morgan, C,
was in charge of the meeting.

WAA Plans Dances

Every Wednesday, from 12:30

* to 1:30 o’clock, the Women’s Ath-
P letic association holds a co-recre-

ational dance in the girls’ gym-
nasium. Music is supplied by
popular recordings.

2 So far,. perhaps through lack of

' publicity, these dances have not

been too well attended. At any
rate, the Women’s Athletic asso-
ciation hopes to see more people
attending them this semester.
Everyone is invited.

All girls interested in partic-
ipating in the dancing for the
Pitt Players’ Spring Musical
should -come to a meeting ‘in
124 Cathedral at 3:30 o’clock,
Wednesday, February 28. Pre-
vious training in dancing is re-
quired.

Rushing Begins

For Women

Women’s social fraternities will
open spring rushing tomorrow
evening with progressive par-
ties. Additional parties have been
planned for Friday and Saturday
evenings; all affairs carry out
novel themes and have an element
of surprise to them.

Each fraternity’s headquarters
will be the scene of the parties

tomorrow from 6:45 to 8:15 o’clock
and from 8:30 to 10 o’clock.
Women are permitted to attend
two different parties and must
stay the full length of time at each
place.

Invitations for Friday and Sat-
urday night parties may be obtain-
ed by freshman women in Miss
Harriet Glasser’s ofﬁce Friday
morning, February 23 from 10:30
to 12:30 o’clock. Answers on the
en-closed cards must be returned
to the same oﬁ’ice by 2 o’clock.
Friday and Saturday night par-
ties are from 7:30 to 9:30 o’clock.

Silence period will begin at 9:30
o'clock Saturday evening and will
continue until 7 o’clock Monday
evening. During this «period,
alumnae as well as active mem-
bers, must refrain from contact-
ing rushees. There will be no coke
dates, luncheon dates, or lengthy
conversations.

Any girl who received an in-
vitati-on to any rushing party must
fill out a preferential ballot in
the Syria Lebanon room Mon-
day, February 26 from 10 to 1
o’clock. Rushees will call for no-
tiﬁcation of their pledge at 6
o’clock ‘Monday evening.

Ribbon ceremonies will take
place Monday evening at 7:30.
Pledging ceremonies will take
place Tuesday, February 27.

We of the Engineering and
Mines Schools are giving you, the
student body, the chance you’ve
wanted. You have asked for an-
other dance, so we’re giving it to
you. The annual E & M dance
will go ahead as planned and will
be held on April 7.

We have considered the situa-

A tion governing school dances from

every angle. From this, we have
come to the conclusion that the
only drawback to the success of
this dance will be in the lack of
school spirit by your support. We
are endeavoring by this dance to
regain the school spirit we have
temporarily lost. With cooperation
on part of the studentbody, we
can fully accomplish this and
bring together group social ties
with the University. The E & M

association is in full chafge of the

affair, and all we ask is your un-
reserved support by your. attend-

/ GTLCQ.

didn’t have enough support. We
never had a dance that lost money,
and we didn’t want to start them.
This semester, however, there
seems to be a goodly portion of
Pitt men and women who want a
dance. So we intend to show the
college we can have successful

dances.

Roy Reinhard,

Treasurer of the Engineering
and Mines Association.

Petitions for the chairmanship
and business managership of the
Engineering and Mines dance, to
be held on April 7, are now being
considered by the Engineering and
Mines cabinet.

Only students enrolled in the
Engineering and Mines school are
eligible for these positions. The
proper petition forms may be ob-
tained at the ofﬁce of the dean of

A memorial service for the late
Dr. W. T. Root, dean of the Grad-
uate School and head of the de-
partment of psychology, will be
held in the Heinz Memorial
chapel this afternoon at 4:15
o’clock. The time of the service is

All friends of Dr. Root from both
campus and community are invit-
ed to attend.

Pitt Observes
Charter Day

“The board of trustees of the
Pittsburgh Academy will meet to-
night in Mr. Morrow’s tavern.”
Such an announcement might
have appeared in a Pittsburgh
newspaper prior to 1787. For in
those days, environment was sub-
ject to ambition. From these
meetings and through the efforts
of Mr. Hugh Henry Brackenridge
came the Academy charter.

On February 28, 1787 an odd
group of professors and students
dressed in doeskin and velvet,
furcaps and felt caps, silk stock-
ings and leather leggings, troop-
ed into the log cabin academy,
conﬁdent of state support.

Next Sunday, February 25, a
group of metropolitan Pittsburgh-
ers will gather in Heinz Chapel to
bless the energy and fortitude of
these pioneer trustees, instructors,
and students——the godfathers of
the University’ of Pittsburgh.

‘Th Reverend Raymond Britain
will lead the Vesper service of the
University’s ‘Charter Day. Dr.
William Farmer will speak, and
the Heinz Chapel choir will sing.

Thursday, February 22,
Washington’s birthday will be
observed, and classes in all
schools except Medicine, Den-
tistry, and the ESMWT division
will not meet. The University

Final pep rally of the current
basketball season will take place
today ..l 12:30 o’clock in Stephen
Foster memorial, and will end

by 1:15 o’clock. A program is
being planned by chairman James
Ludwig, C, which will include a
prominent sports ﬁgure as master
of ceremonies, and speeches by
Dr. H. C. Carlson and members of
the ﬂoor squad. '

Dr. Carlson will end his twenty-
third year as Pitt court coach and
Tay Malarkey an-d Phil Marder
will be bidding their goodbyes to
Pitt fans since they both graduate
from Dental school. Farewell will
be due Dodo Canterna, breaker of
a scoring record in his freshman
year, who will be on his way to
the Air Corps next month. The
cheerleaders and the Pitt Panther
will be doing their share on the
stage. ,

Pep rally leader James Ludwig
says, “This is our last home game
of the season. Let’s all turn out
for the rally and show the team
we’re behind them all the way.”

Student Congress

Sponsors Dance

“Dutch Victory Dance” with the
slogén “Show up or Shut Up” will
be sponsored by Student congress
after the game tonight. Twenty-
ﬁve cents per person will be
charged for admission to the
dance,, to be held in the Women’s
gym.» ‘The dance will not be a
date affair.

The Tuck shops may be open

for the dance, but if they are
closed, other provision will be
made for _refreshments. Music

will be provided by recoridngs.
Larry Burwinkle, C, together
with the Appointments committee
of Student congress is responsible
for the idea for the dance. Ac-
cording to Bob Dixon, C, vice-
president of Student congress, the
dance is an answer to the clamor
of those who objected to the can‘-
cellation of some school dances by

 

 

9 As chancellor, Dr. Bowman cre-

ated our 42-story Cathedral of
Learning, and during his tenure of
office he changed the University
from the scattered group of 20
buildings on the upper campus to
the Gothic tower which has be-
come Pitt’s symbol throughout
the world.

He also added a School of Ap-
plied Social Sciences, a School- of
Nursing, the Research Bureau for
Retail Training, the Bureau of
Business Research; and a Division
of Research in the Natural Sci-
ences, making a total of 20 schools
and divisions, all of them accred-
ited on the highest academic
levels.

Of more importance than build-
ing, he said, was ‘what he had tried
to bring into the minds and lives
of people. “I would rather be
known for making headway in

pose in life than in having built
any buildings. I would sooner
have taught people to be patriotic,
to be good citizens, to be trust-
worthy, than to be known for any
of this other.”

Executive Committeeman Floyd
Rose, explained that the duties of
the president, in general, would
“be related to the growth of the
University and to the maintenance

Dear Edi-tor:

I have just ﬁnished reading to-
day’s copy of the Pitt News. On
page one are the announcements
of the “Hello Week” activities,
the mass meeting of women, Ash
Wednesday chapel, Customs Sing,
“Y” dinner, Phi Eta Sigma meet-
ing and the Freshman Chapvel'\.
Page two contains the announce-
ments -of the ECAAUW meeting
and _discussion. Page three tells of
the sophomore women’s variety
hour and the Freshman council
dinn-er. Page f-our reports the'Pre—
Social club meeting, Phi Eta Sig-
ma meeting and Quax meeting.
The sports events are announced
on page six.

By tomorrow, I will have lost
to-day’s copy of the news. As a
matter of fact, now that I have
ﬁnished treading the paper, I can’t
remember all that I have read
about the activities. If these ac-
tivities were printed in block form,
I believe they would be m-ore
effective. The information n-ow
spread out in one or two inches
on five or six pages could be con-
densed to two or three lines per
item in one block answering the
vital how, where. when, who, a-nd
what. .

I realize that we have, a bul-
letin board, Vade Mecum, and
Pitt Comp-ass, and the column “On

Pinky . . .. Pat
And Pitt

During the past two weeks,
Pittsburghers have been fortunate
enough to witness the Army Air
Force production, “Winged Vic-
tory.” With the exception of 40

actresses, the men on the stage
and those behind the scenes are
strictly GI. The “trite” (bless our
English department) words stu-
pendous, colossal, magniﬁcent! are
the only ones I can think of to de-
scribe this production, so I think
I’ll leave that part to Monahan
and Parry.

I’m deﬁnitely not a bobby-soxer,
but there is a certain Freeport, Pa.
soldier in one of the leading roles
who makes me yell for smelling
salts! I refer of course to Staff
Sergeant Don Taylor, or Danny
(Pinky) Scariano. As I waited
my turn‘ to ﬁre questions at Pinky,
I was ﬁnally, rewarded when he
looked up suddenly and yelled,
“Where’.s that Pitt girl?” I col-
lected myself and my pen and
ﬁred away.

Don was graduated in Penn

State College Dramatics in 1942
and went out to Hollywood imme-
diately. After 9 months at MGM
he got a part in “Swing Shift
Maisie.”
/’ He has dark brown eyes and
sandy hair. He is almost six feet
tall, a ﬁne actor, and a very
friendly guy. You can have
Frankie; I’m a ‘Pinky’ fan myself.’
OK! So I am a bobby-soxer!

ticles on campus activities. The
one--inch articles could be elimi-
nated under the block system and
longer articles of University in-
terest could be printed.

The University cry is that Pitt
lacks school spirit. How can you
have spirit about events that pass
without student interest being
aroused? For example, the bulle-
tin board on Wednesday, Febru-
ary l2, ‘had an announcement of
an orchestra meeting to which
new members were invited. Wed-
nesdayis issu-e of the Pitt News
had nothing to say about the
meeting. Probably other events
take’ place without the students’
knowing about them. Information
about activities is as hard to ﬁnd
as a pack of cigarettes. Unless he
has time for daily consultation of
the bulletin board (and how many
remember every -day that we have
a bulletin board?) the average
student is at a loss to know what
is going on. Often, by the time
the bulletin has been glanced over,
it is too late to make plans to
attend the activity.

‘A coniposite table of activities
for the week could be_cut out and
‘pinned, in our lockers.‘ There
_should be no «excuse for lack of
school spirit, because of lack of

The sports boys were in a little"
huddle in The Pitt News oﬁ"ice last
Thursday, Ed Citron, the fastest,
typist on the staff, propped his
feet on the desk and grinned
cheerfully.

“The enthusiasm,” he said, us-
ing one of his college words, “at
the V Pitt-Westminster basketball
game Wednesday evening was
wonderful. The stadium was just
bulging with Pitt kids.’’i [

Then J ism Ludwig burst into the
ofﬁce Monday afternoon to put a

notice in the paper about a bas-

ketball pep rally

To add to that, an-d I do mean
add, Bill Ross, presid-ent of the
Engineering and Mines associa-
tion, clamo,red in with a notice
that the engineers are going to
have a dance . . “a reallygood
dance,” he said.

There isn’t much of a basket-
ball season left, but if we have

the same attendance at the rest of ,

’£h_€. games. that we had at the
Pitt-Westminster game, it .Will

mean a lot. If the "students attend!

the engineers’ dance, it will mean
just as much, and plenty more."
Pitt men and women have no-
ticed that The Pitt News has been
campaigning, but hard, in the past
few months. The school paper has
been voicing :the opinion of a

great many students concerning

“nogood times” here. Now that
results. seem to be coming. in,
we’re starting to rub our palms“
together and guffaw gleefully.
But the big results, what we

really want, are still in the dim A

and hazy future of the n-exttwo
months. One of the most import-
ant. of these will be the success

of the Engineering and Mines»

dance. The seriousness of the out-i
come of that dance cannot be:
stressed too greatly. For the engi-
neers and for the student body
we’re hoping there’s a great turn-
out. i l

The dance isn’t until April 7.
But believe me‘ when I say. that
this isn‘t too early to start writing
about it. It’s going to be a big
deal. ‘Future dances and social
aﬂairs at Pitt may depend on its
outcome. Amen.

  Donating Blood Not Art;
Procedure Very Simple

Donating your blood to the Red Cross is not an art. It means in-

dict’ convenience, but there is nothing painful involved.

Prerequisites for giving blood are very few: the donor’s health

 must be good; he must not have eaten for 3 hours; and he must be
If a donor is between the ages of 18 and 21, he

Each blood donor receives a thorough examination before giving

 his plasma, for the protection of?
C ,, both the donor and the receiver

of the blood.

The examination is short and
consists in taking temperature,
blood count, pulse, and the asking
If
the donor has a temperature higher
or lower than 98.6°, he cannot give
blood because he may have a dis-
ease which might have a bad ef-

* feet on his blood.

' A blood test is made by jabbing

—a «ﬁnger and matching the speci-

men obtained on a color chart.
This is done as a check for anemia.
In the donating room the donor

‘ . lies in a prone ‘position while his

arm is swabbed with alcohol or

,i I iodine and punctured with a hol-
" low tube. The donor then clenches

a wooden handle which makes the
‘veins stand out, and the needle

‘goes through the tube into the

vein. The needle is attached to a
rubber tube that is taped to the

. arm; the other end of the rubber

-‘tube is in the small jar where the

5 blood is collected.

~After a pint of blood is given,
the needle is removed and gauze
is placed over the “wound.” The
patient lies still, holding his arm

4 higher than head till the blood
clots.

Then an aide bandages the
wound and the patient sits on the
side of the bed for a moment.

Because the loss of a pint of

ﬂ blood weakens the donor, a can-

teen serves sandwiches and bever-
ages. He has his choice of a ham

 -or cheese sandwich and coffee,
a coke, fruit juice, milk, or water;

however, he must drink three

Exceeding its quota for the fourth

Cross Blood Donor service in 1944
procured 5,371,664 pints of blood
for the armed forces, or 371,664
pints more than their estimated
requirements, it was announced
today by Basil O’Connor, ‘Red
Cross national chairman.

The .1944 record represents an
average of ten pints of blood a
minute. day and night throughout
the year and brings to 11,024,015
pints the total amount procured
since the inception of the project
in February, 1941, Mr. O’Connor
stated. He said that the Army and
Navy have requested the Red
Cross to continue procurement in

000 pints a year.

Hailing the four-year record as
an “outstanding testimonial to the
determination of the American
public to back up the men over-
seas,” Chairman O’Connor said
that 31 Centers and 43 mobile
units are participating in the pro-
gram, and called. on the people in
those communities to continue
their support of the project.

“Despite this magniﬁcent record
-.'W€ must not let down,” he said.
“The drain on supplies is enorm-
ous and numerous cases have been
reported. in which twenty or more
pints of plasma have been requir-
ed to save one man. We must ob-
tain approximatly 100,000 addi-
tional pints -o-f blood every week to

‘Mr. O’Connor cited four princi-
pal reasons for the success of the
program: the response of millions
of individual donors; the co-opera-
tion of business ﬁrms, labor
unions, and other organizations in
sending in a regular number of
donors each week; the co-opera-
tion of the-radio, the press and
other publicity media; and the
support of thousands of Red Cross
workers.

The inauguration of the “whole
blood” program was the year’s
outstanding development, Mr.
O’Connor said. This whole blood,
collected in ﬁve centers on each
coast, is ﬂown daily to Europe and

Blood, yours and mine, is one of
the most essential commoditiesin
this war. It is the easiest thing to
give and, seemingly, the hardest
thing to get. ‘Good news from the
Various fronts is usually bad news
for blood donations.

Red ‘Cross oﬁ‘icials have tried
their best to impress on the
American public the fact that
there is still a long, bitter strug-
gle ahead and that the need for
human blood plasma is increasing
rather than decreasing. From time
to time, the Red Cross puts on a
campaign to increase blood dona-
tions, complete with blazing pos-
ters and special programs. Then,
the public responds nobly and
everybody is happy ab-out the
whole thing.

'The source of the trouble is
that the time in between these
campaigns is usually always
marked by a decrease in dona-

After being in this war over
three years, Americans should not
need -constant reminders of the
need to give blood.’ Every war
headline, whether good or bad,
and every passing service ribbon
should keep this vital need con-
stantly before us. Blood plasma
has saved thousands of lives and
paved the road home for men
whose lives would have been lost
in past wars———wars when the mir-
acle of plasma was as yet un-
known.

We should be extremely grate-
ful for the discovery of plasma.
Through it, we, here at home, can

Pitt Students Drop In

On RCBB for Lunch

By Ursula Halloran

and Dick Barnhzlrtv

This week Pittpourri goes to the Blood Bank. .

The ﬁrst good thing that happened to us Thursday was a free 

parking space for blood donors only. We’re saving the ticket stub for

future use.

As we went into the Wabash building an. electric meter ’
clicked off the number of blood donors.

The meter read 56, but when

Bob Buell walked past the thing jumped {to 58.

Since Pittsburgh is featuring

Nonchalantly I made my grand
entrance into the “Wabash build-
ing. I regret not having been able
to take due advantage of the
teeth exposed in friendly smiles
’cause I was preoccupied with a
squadron of butterﬂies that had
just made a forced landing in the
pit of my stomach. Man, those
B-24’s were coming in at top
speed. Well, the following scenes
resemble a usualU.niversity regis-
tration day. Writing your name
plus writing your name plus writ-
ing your name. (I know now there

Then came the famous pre-

oped an acute case of St. Vitus

I’m disappointed ’cause the haemo-

We went upstairs in a luxurious
elevator with all the comforts and
conveniences of a death cell. Up-
stairs, Mike Kravchak cast a side-
long glance at a chute in the well
and asked if that was how they got
rid of the casualties. When the
girl at the desk asked Buell, “Did
you come to donate a pint of
blood, Sonny?” he irately replied,
“No, I came to make a with-
drawal.”

Another of Bibbie’s Bright Bon-
ers was, upon seeing the lights
hanging on long wires from the
ceiling to the tables on which the
“Gracious, they even
have the Body Jack to get me up
on the table.”

From behind a closed door came
the voice of June Thomson pro-
testing, “But I’ve got only one
corpuscle.” To which the nurse
snapped crisply, “We’ll take it!” 4

While our little friends were be-
ing assembled on the hard tables
a la fraternity house beds, we
dashed back to the outer ofﬁce to
get some serious material from
the nurse.‘ When we asked how
many donorsthey had each day
she gave us a cold quizzical stare
and asked, in a voice reminiscent
of Scarlett O’Hara, “Is yo all re-
potahs?” .We assented with a
gesture combining the best fea-
tures of a Half—Gopher and a
headstand. She then looked at us
with the soft light of love in her
eyes, saying, “Aaaaawww, youse
can’t fool me,” and with a quick
shove of her meaty arm she pushed
us down he elevator shaft.

So we climbed the stairs hand-
over—head and hobbled back to our
friends. A, As we strolled past the
line of tables where our suffering
donors were lying we heard the
following comments:

Jean Mostoller moaned, “It’s
not giving a pint of blood that
bothers me—but don’t you think

from across the room 0

Arnie Steinman, who
nurses’ hearts with his ye;
maroon suspenders, said, “I
they havenlt forgotten he
shut this thing off.”

Mike Kravchak said, “I knew I
was rugged, but I didn’t think
they’d need a battering ram to
drive the needle in.”

Bob (Back Room)‘ Buell prom-
ised to faint for us, but he couldn’t
quite manage it. He compromised
by turning a gangrenous green at
three second intervals. He came
out of the ordeal with a new man-
ufacturing scheme—to make neon
blood donor buttons.

Afterwards they forced food
upon us. They offered ham or
cheese sandwiches on white or rye
bread, coffee, milk, coke, or water.
Buell ordered a combination and
a cup of tea. Steinman drank
water and said, “This is a cheap
drunk.” (Unquote.)

Incidentally, if you get stuck
downtown without any money and
want a free lunch, do what June

Thomson, Bicky Feldman, Mildred 
and Pearl Weiner did.’

Shagam,
Down at the printer’s the other
day with a nickel among them,
they dropped in, donated blood
and had a free lunch, thereby solv-
ing the food problem.

Those giving blood last Thurs-
day were Bob Buell, Jean Mos-
toller, and Mike Kravchak. Arnie
Steinman’s do-nation came out sloe
gin.

Howard Lupovitz did not give
blood. However, he wanted to see
his name in print,

of those spiritual ideas which have
always had a central place in Dr.
Bowman’s thought for the Univer-
sity.

The board of trustees were act-
ing upon Dr. Bowman’s recom-
mendation of 1941, when he dis-
cussed his eventual resignation, in
choosing Dr. Fitzgerald for the
new position. The board said that
it had created the post of presi-
dent for Dr. Bowman because it is
eager to keep his active interest
in the advancement and progress
of the University.

Theibuilding of the Cathedral
was only one of Dr. Bowman’s tre-
mendous projects. He also under-
took the creation of the Univer-
sity’s Medical Center, composed of
six hospitals and the Falk clinic.
Heinz chapel and the Foster me-
morial were constructed during
this tenure, as was the highway
engineering lab. All in all the
total cost of buildings constructed,
debt-free during the chancellor’s
regime, reaches 32 million dollars.

For the future, Dr. Bowman en-
visions a $5,000,000 ﬁne arts group
of buildings on the campus, front-
ing on Forbes street,-a $2,250,000
science building on Fifth avenue
near Belleﬁeld, opposite Mellon in-
stitute, a $2,000,000 medical labor-
atory in the Medical center, and
the completion of the Cathedral
‘at a cost of $1,000,000. Our sky-
scraper has cost $10,000,000 to
date. -

Dr. Bowman was born in Dav-
enport, Ia., May 18, 1877, and was
graduated from the University of
Iowa‘ in 1899. Five years later he
took his master of arts degree.
After studying at Columbia Uni-
versity and spending two years in
newspaper work in Chicago, Dr.
Bowman returned to Iowa as an
instructor. Later he taught at C0-
lumbia, was secretary of the Car-

/ negie Foundation for the Advance-

ment of Teaching and became
president of his alma mater. Be-
fore coming to Pitt as chancellor,
he was director of the American
College of Surgeons for six years.

Dr. Fitzgerald was born in Pel-

was graduated from the Univer-
sity of Tennessee. He was a fac-

In his speech Mr. Fernbaugh

will give special emphasis to the

Following the formal address,

who will conduct an open" forum.
“All students and faculty who are
interested in the current labor sit-

tend the meeting and submit their
questions,” said WSA President
Scavriel.

This meeting is the ﬁrst of a

Among the topics to be consid-

Penn Shatters
Cadets’ Streak

. , The University of Pennsylva-
V ’°nia, newly crowned Eastern Inter-
gcollegiate champions, handed Ar-
imylits ﬁrst basketball defeat in
two years Saturday night with a
61-52 victory before 11,500 fans in
the opener of a Convention Hall
doubleheader.

Penn’s triumph snapped a 27-
"game winning sereak compiled by
the Cadets who hadn’t lost a game
since a setback by Fordham early
in 1943. Army currently was rid-
ing a crest which gave it top-
notch ranking among the nation’s
teams._

Won the game early in the second
half when they held the Cadets to
one point in.seven minutes while
rolling up ﬁfteen of their own.
This spree wiped out Army’s 29-25
halftime edge and reinforced Penn
for a late Cadet surge.
’ Penn gained its triumph in a
great display of teamwork. Capt.
Howard Dallmar, former All—Am—
erican at Stanord university, play-
ed a‘ superb game on the back-
boards, both offensively and de-
fensively.

‘Play Here Tenite, End Season

;nThers Meet Mountaineers In Two-Game Finale

At Mergantown Saturday; Pitt
Five Gunning For Clean Sweep

By Larry Bondy

The Panthers bow out of the
local basketball picture tonight at
8:15 o’clock on the Pavilion ﬂoor
when they tackle the West Vir-
ginia Mountaineers. On Saturday
night, in Mountaineer territory,
the ﬁghting Phantoms will end
their 1944 season.

The Panthers hope to make a
comeback after their pitiful ap-
pearance at Penn State where they
suffered a 53-36 setback, their
third of the season. The Carlson
tootsies have lost all hope of a
post-season offer to appear in the
Gardens, but, if they trim the
Mountaineers twice, they will be
tri-state champs.

Coach John Brickel’s squad
comes here with a Saturday night
win over Bethany and a record of
11 victories and 4 defeats. Beth-
any’s defeat marked the end of a
3'-game West Virginia losing streak
suffered at the hands of Army,
Temple and Navy. West Virginia
gained fame as they trampled their
ﬁrst ﬁve opponents before being
polished off by Penn State in a
return engagement. By defeating
NYU in the Buffalo Gardens 41-40,
West Virginia was marked for a
post-season bid but the State de-
feat set them tumbling down the
ladder of the great eastern teams.

West Virginia floors a freshman
squad. Leland Byrd, a 6—foot-3,
left-handed forward from Ma-
tooka, is a scoring threat as well
as being tough under the bank-
boards. Paring oﬁ with Byrd at
the other forward post is Bob Car-
roll a 5’ 11" boy from Wheeling.

wood as on the gridiron.

Dr. Carlson intends to start a
revamped lineup against West Vir-
ginia. Dodo Canterna, the Free-
port plebe who broke all scoring
records at the Stadium against
Westminster, will be gunning for
another skyscraper ﬁgure. Dodo’s
37 points are the highest any col-
lege player recorded in Pittsburgh.
With the aid of his teammates he
will be the biggest threat to the
Mountaineers. Nate Apple will
again be at his customary forward
spot. At the center will be
“Smiley” Hank Zeller. Hank
spelled the diﬁerence between
a total rout at State, and
merely the mediocre contest which
.took place. Hank was everywhere
:on the -court Saturday night as
he intercepted passes, controlled
"the boards, and ran up 20 points.
Mar-der will be at a guard post
and Tay Malarkey, who will be
appearing in his ﬁnal game at
the Stadium, will be at the other
guard. '

‘The Mountaineers are a pretty
rugged bunch, but the Panther
quintet will be favored tonight
because of the advantag-e of play-
ing on their own court. Saturday
will be a different story. They’ll
be down in Morgantown, and
they’re plenty rough down there.
The Hill Boys haven’t dropped a

he can do it.

istration here, wish to get in touch

‘Riﬂes Win In

Three Matches

Through the AST program and
ROTC units, Pitt is able to boast
of two riﬂe teams that are far bet-
ter than average.

During the past week the ROTC
riﬂe team ﬁred against a total of
seven teams including: Pennsyl-

vania, New Hampshire, Montana, .

Idaho, Virginia Polytechnic, Get-
tysburg, and Maryland. Of these,
only the results of three encounters
have been tabulated and these in-
clude three victories over Penn-
sylvania, Virginia Polytechnic, and
Gettysburg. 7

In these-meets our boys ﬁred a

total score of 1794 out of a possible
perfect score of 2000 which is ﬁne
shooting in any man’s language.

At the time of this printing the
inter-collegiate matches, sponsored
by the third service command,
will be under way. In these
matches Pitt will meet many of the
college teams it has already shot
against (and in many cases has
defeated), so our chances of a
ﬁne showing are somewhat better
than average.

These inter-collegiate matches
are the highlights of the riﬂe sea-
son. If Pitt should place in the
inter-collegiate matches we will
be able to compete in a national
ﬁring event made up ofthe win-
ners of the collegiate matches
sponsored by the other service
commands.

Following the same pattern on¢

the basketball court that gained
them prominence on the gridiron

last season, an underdog Phi Ep
team rose from obscurity to dump
the PiKAs from the ranks of the
unbeaten. This 30 to 22 victory
served to throw the I-F basket-
ball race into complete chaos as
most of the strong teams in the
league have now been beaten.

The Phi Eps dominated the
game throughout, leading 14 to 7
at the half and 20 to 12 at the end
of the third quarter. The PiKAs
tried hard to ‘cut down the Phi Ep
lead; however, the sharpshooting
‘of Dick Seewald and Marv Silver-
blatt managed to stave them off.
Both Gallagher and Valincik
played brilliantly for the losers as
they garnered a total of 17 points
between them.

Phi Eps beat Phi Delts

In the preliminary game to the ‘

Pitt-Westminster fray, the Phi Eps
defeated the Phi Delts 39 to 26.
With a large crowd on hand both
teams exhibited some ﬁne basket-
ball play. Trailing by only one
point throughout the first half, the
Phi Delts were forced to succumb
when they no longer had any re-
placements who could match the
speedier\ Phi Eps.
SAE’s trounce Phi Kaps

Exhibiting a surprisingly strong
team, the SAEs overwhelmed the
Phi Kaps 50 to 32. With Payton
scoring 30 points, the SAEs won
easily. The Phi Kaps’ inability
to stop this star proved their
downfall. Shining for the losers
was Bill Boyd who continually
outguessed the SAE defensemen.
This one-sided victory decidely
classiﬁes the SAEs as one of the
stronger teams in the league, and
throws the basketball race into a
three-way affair between the Phi
Eps, the PiKAs and the SAEs.

almost everything he threw Whip-

personally accounted for Pitt’s
ﬁrst victory over Westminster-L
a 75-56 rout—-in their last eight 5

When the ﬁnal tabulations were

a late supper ended the dance.

Then to put aﬁnishing touch to
