Students compete
for rooms in lottery

By Michele Quinn
For The Pitt News

Throughout this week, Pitt stu-
dents who wish to live on cam-
pus next year will be participating
in the ”Lottery,” a numerical

selection process, in the Tower A

Conference Room.

The ’’Lottery’’ consists of each
student drawing a number from
a bowl corresponding to his or
her gender. If the number drawn
falls in the range of 1 through 769
for males and 1 through 940 for
females, the student will receive
a housing contract for next year.

Bob Robinson, director of
housing, said that approximately
3,000 students will participate in
this selection. For upperclassmen
who now reside on campus,
there are. 1,709 beds available.

The remaining 613 are already
committed to resident assistants,
athletes, scholars, international
students and physically impaired
students.

’’I think they should definitely

‘ invest in building more housing

for the non-scholars and non-
athletes. The athletes and scho-
lars are guaranteed hous'ing, and
that's not fair like they said the
lottery system is supposed to be,”
said sophomore Jim Whitford.

Those students who select
numbers which do not fall in the

‘designated ranges can be placed

on the waiting list at the end of
March. Students who are ar-
ranged on this list according to
their ”Lottery” number will
receive housing after cancella-
tions within the quota occur.

The Pitt ”Lottery” was estab-

lished eight years ago after many
unsuccessful attempts at other
systems. '

”We used to have a first-come,
first-serve basis, but then the

problem was that people would_

be camping‘ out three days be-
fore,” Bob Robinson said.

The housing office also tried to _

place applications in students’
mailboxes. The first 2,600 com-
pleted and processed would be
accepted. However, this also
failed as the students with mail-
boxes at the end of the mailroom
would wait for hours to receive
their application. .

”The lottery allows us to serv-
ice more people,” Robinson said.
"It gets rid of the long lines. 
The odds are the same on any
day, so it doesn't matter when
you draw.”

Pitt is not unlike many large,

schools with housing shortages.

Daniel accepts post at
University of Illinois

By Beth Froelich
Staff Writer

Director of the University Child
Development Center, Jerlean
Daniel, has accepted a position
as an associate professor at the

University of Illinois at Chicago ,

and will leave Pitt at the end of
this term.

Daniel's new position as an as-
sociate professor will include
some teaching responsibilities;
however, the majority of her time
will be directed towards the col-
laborative advocacy of child care.

”There are many issues in child
care today which need to be
voiced,” said Daniel. ”One of
those issues is. state and national
subsidizing of child care.

”Generally our society has not

valued child care in the past,”

continued Daniel. ”Child care
employees, those with bachelor's
degrees included, are not paid
very well. Recently, there has
been a nation-wide push to rec-
tify this situation.”

Daniel played an instrumental
role _in the establishment of the
Child Development Center here
at Pitt. The center was adopted by
the university in August of 1 984.
It was an offspring of a similar
program at _Carl_ow College,
which Daniel directed." _

”I still marvel at the fact that the

center exists at all, much less its ’

being financially sound,” said
Daniel. ”It was not easy starting
the center, but we received a lot
of positive support from the
university.” , -

The UCDC‘ cares for 100 tod-
dlers andinfants and is open to
the general public. It specifically

provides child care to parents
. who are either employees or stu-

dents at Pitt.

Daniel not only serves as the
director of the program but also
as the chief administrator and
child developmental specialist.

Daniel will not makethe move
to Chicago alone. Her husband,
Jack, Pitt's assistant provost, will

Reagan names new CIA chief

By Terence Hunt
AP White House Correspondent

WASHINGTON — Robert
Gates, a CIA official who report-
edly urged disclosure of secret
arms sales to Iran before they
were revealed, was picked by
President Reaganon Monday to
replace the ailing William J.
Casey as director of the agency.

The 73-year-old Casey,
recuperating from surgery he had
seven weeks ‘ago for a brain
tumor, was invited to become a
counselor to the president when
and if he can return to work.

Gates, 43, has been the No. 2
official at the CIA since 1982 and

has been running the agency in‘

Casey's absence.

A 20-year veteran of service in
the CIA and the White House Na-
tional Security Council “ as _a
Soviet affairs expert, Gates is
widely respected-on Capitol Hill
and should not have difficulty
winning Senateconfirmation.

However, he is certain to be
grilled about the CIA’s role in the
secret sale of arms to Iran and the
diversion of profits to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels. A
report by the Senate lntelligence
Committee stated that Casey, in
testimonyabout the affair late last
year, ”was general in nature” and
left many questions unanswered.

’’I particularly look forward to
working with Robert Gates, who
is a professional in this field and
for whom I have high regard,”
said Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.)
chairman of the Senate Foreign

‘Relations Committee.

A long-time friend of the presi-
dent, Casey became director of
the CIA in 1981 after managing
Reagan's White House
campaign.

He suffered a seizure last Dec. .

15, a day before he was to appear
before the’ Senate lntelligence
Committee and underwent sur-

gery three days later for removal _

of a cancerous tumor.
According to an associate,
Casey's last words before being
wheeled into surgery were, ”I
hope Dave Durenberger doesn't

. It was Mr. Casey's
decision to resign.
— Marlin Fitzwater

think I'm copping out on him.”
Durenberger (R-Minn.) was the
chairman of the Intelligence
Committee at the time.

The committee's report,
released last week, said a CIA
analyst went to Gates last Oct. 1
and said he was‘ concerned that
money from the secret arms sale
to Iran were being diverted to
Central America. ‘

”Gates was surprised and dis-
turbed and told the analyst to see
Casey,” the report stated. It quot-
ed the analyst as saying he and

Gates did not discuss whether or '

not a diversion would be illegal.
Gates on Oct. 15 directed the
CIA’s general counsel to review

all aspects of the Iran deal to
make sure nothing was being

done that was illegal. The coun.- _'

sel later reported there was noth-
ing amiss from the CIA
standpoint. .

According to Gates’ testimony ’

in the report, he and Casey urged

. the national security adviser at

the time, John Poindexter, to
have Reagan make the Iran ini_tia-
tive public, rather than have it
leak out ”in'dribs and drabs.” At
that time, they warned there

- might have been some diversion

of funds, the report stated.

Casey testified to the Senate ln-
telligence Committee on Nov. 21
but did not mention the possibil-
ity ‘of funds being diverted.

‘ Gates said later information
about the diversion ”was based
on analytical judgment of bits
and pieces of information by one
intelligence officer and that they

[Casey and Gates] didn't consider.

that very much to go on, although
it was enough to raise our con-
cerns to the point where we ex-

pressed them to the, White_

House.” _
, Casey offered his resignation
during a meeting in his hospital

room with White House Chief of ,

Staff Donald Regan’ and Attorney

General Edwin Meese last Thurs- .

day. A day later, Reagan talked
with Gates in an unannounced

meeting in the Oval Office,’offer-

ing him the job.

”It was Mr. Casey's decision to
resign,” said Marlin Fitzwater,
the president's new chief spokes-_
man. . .

Chief officer of FAA resigns in midst of overhaul

WASHINGTON —- The Feder-
al Aviation Administration's top
medical officer resigned his post
amid criticism that he had certi-
fied commercial pilots who were
not medically fit to fly.

At the same time, the FAA said
it would ”revamp the personnel
structure and  procedures” in
the federal air surgeon's office be-
cause of findings by a special in-
dustry panel of inadequate record
keeping on pilot certification
cases.

FAA administrator Donald En-
gen said in a written statement
that Dr. Frank Austin, the federal
air surgeon, was being reassigned
at his own request ”in an effort
to end polarization in the aviation
community over the medical cer-
tification process.”

Aquino constitution
receives endorsement

MANILA, Philippines — Presi-
dent Corazon Aquino won a
decisive victory as Filipinos over-
whelmingly endorsed her pro-
posed constitution and another 5
years of her leadership, unofficial

_r_eturns showed. ,

Filipinos backed the draft chart-
er by a 4—to-1 margin nationwide,
according to the unofficial count
by the private National Move-
ment for Free Elections. Only in
the northern Luzon Island stron-
ghold of former President Ferdi-
nand E. Marcos did a majority of
voters appear to have rejected the
proposal.

Final, official returns from the
Commission on Elections are not
expected before next week.

Guerillas make deal
with government

SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador
— Leftist guerrillas freed an army
colonel held captive for 15
months in exchange for the
government's release of 57
prisoners, government and rebel
sources said.

Col. Omar Napoleon Avalos,‘

the director of civil aviation, was
turned over to the archbishop of
San Salvador, Monsignor Arturo
Rivera Damas, in the north-
eastern village of Perquin, ac-
cording to the rebel sources.
The sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity for secu-

rity reasons, said guerrilla leaders
Joaquin Villalobos and Roberto
Roca released Avalos to Rivera
Damas and delegates of the Inter-
national Red Cross.

At the same time, government
spokesmen who also demanded
anonymity said authorities had
freed the 57 inmates named by
the guerrillas from the Mariona
prison in northern San Salvador.

The government spokesmen
said Avalos, 47, appeared to be
suffering from acute anemia and
would be taken for medical ex-
aminations ata hospital in El Sal-
vador or another country.

Opposition leader to
keep ties with allies

LOS ANGELES —— The leader of
South Africa's biggest black op-
position group pledged that his
followers would establish a mul-
tiracial society if they succeeded
in overturning the present white-
dominated regime.

Oliver Tambo, who has head-
ed "the outlawed African Nation-
al Congress for 20 years, said his
organization wouldn't disavow
ties with socialist and communist
nations that have been its stron-
gest allies.

Tambo made his comments at
a news conference here as part of
a U.S. trip that also included a
meeting with Secretary of State
George Shultz.

WASHINGTON — James C.
McKay, a Washington lawyer,

Nofziger‘violated federal ethics

company get a defense contract.

McKay, a trial lawyer and a
partner in the firm of Covington

Court of Appeals.

The tasteless joke follows a

don't feel so bad about these
jokes because Dwyer was sick
enough to kill ‘himself in a

him a hero in her eulogy. I
think he was just a little too

At any rate here are some of
the latest on Dwyer:

maybe I shouldn't run the
jokes in the paper.

But a couple weeks ago,
several of us on the editorial
staff were invited down to the
set of Pittsburgh 2-Day at
KDKA to listen to four news
directors from the Pittsburgh
media.

Tragedy leaves behind wake of tasteless jokes

Maybe the jokes arise from 2 '
fear of what we don't know. I
don't think» it's apathy or a
case of misunderstanding. The
space shuttle disaster was a
very sobering thing, as is the
horrific life in Ethiopia and the
useless deathrof Budd Dwyer.

It only takes a few moments
for the jokes to begin forming
inlour heads though. We.ra-
tionalize what we don't under-
stand, using humor in the best
way possible. I _

We can't change what ‘Budd, '
Dwyer did. All the talk of a -
man trying to martyr himself
through death doesn't really
workfor any of us.

He said he hoped to show
himself as an example for a
flawed justice system. He be- __ _
came only fodder for jokes.

Allocations plan

needs some help

Among the duties of the Student Government Board is the

- responsibility for the allocation of funds to various student or-

ganizations. The annual allocations process is outlined in a pub-
lication titled Allocations and Operations Manual for Certified-
Student Organizations, distributed every year to each organi-
zation. Failure to proceed according to these guidelines will
result in a denial of funds.

When the American Chemical Society of Student Affiliates
requested funds for a trip to Washington, the SGB was forced
to deny the request because of a failure to comply with the
procedures outlined in the manual. Representatives from the
organization complained that they knew of no such manual

‘and didn't know the guidelines. The Allocations Committee
:maintained that it was the organization's
’ -all members aware of the guidelines.

When the Allocations Committee recommends the denial of

nging for short os?

Q. Where can I get those mini-
condoms? The standard kind
reduce the sensation ‘too much.

A. Your druggist can probably
order them for you from a
manufacturer. I think you should
ask yourself why they are hard to
find. I suspect that experience
with them has been unnerving,
and that is why there is not much
demand for them. I have heard
that they are. easy to lose in the
excitement of lovemaking. Also,
let me point out, they are less ef-
fective than the full-length ones
for preventing the spread of sex-
ually transmitted diseases.

And I think you have talked
yourself into believing that the
standard devices reduce sensa-
tion drastically. There is some
loss of sensation, but very little.
To a sensible person, this loss is
amply compensated by the peace
of mind in knowing he is being
responsible.

Q. I am writing in response to
the letter from the girl who was
just about to marry the only man
she had ever had sex with and
was wondering if she ought to
have that experience with other

Us vs. them vs. we vs. they

I am so glad to have been treat-
ed to such a complete correction
of an obviously flawed editorial

_ on abortion [The Pitt News, Jan.

30]. It really surprised, me. Of
‘course, had the correction itself
not been so flawed, it might have

. I
I Impressed me.

Ms. Hecker’s first correction
wasto clarify that a woman only
has a limited and partial right to
control her own body. Gee, that's
comforting to know. And who
has the remainder of the right to
control her body? According to
the remedy suggested by Ms.
Hecker, the reversal of Roe vs.

I Wade and similar decisions,.that

right would be turned over to the
individual state governments.

' But I thought we had a Bill of
Rights that forbids the federal and
state governments from passing
laws that interfere with their
citizens’ individual rights. ls Ms.
Hecker suggesting that we allow
states to interfere -with their
citizens’ individual rights? Would
you like to see all doctors", with

state approval, be able to tell ev-
ery mother what she could or
couldn't eat, drink or smoke dur-
ing pregnancy to protect the un-
born? Would you like to see
genetic scientists assert

_government—approved rights to

subject expectant mothers to var-
ious tests and operations? . I
thought a government that al-
lowed that was called Nazi Ger-
many, not the United States.
Maybe I was_wrong.

Then, in the next paragraph of
her critique, our learned educa-
tor states that ”abortion is the des-
truction of a separate human
body." Wow! I hope Webster
hears about this because those sil-
ly dictionary editors honestly be-
lieve that ”separate” means not
connected. I'm sure they'll be
happy to know of their error.

I was ‘also very happy to hear
that pro-lifers ”_are the ones who
really care about both the mother
and the baby.” Of course, failure
to put the word ”rich” in front of

» ”mother” must have_been a cler- '

|.£mans

iical oversight. After all, the rever-

sal of Roe vs. Wade will simply
mean that rich parents will be
able to send their teen-age daugh-
ters to Europe to safely protect the
girls’ social and economic [fu-
tures], while the rest of America's
women will return to the days of
the back-alley clinic and the coat
hangen

I'm certain that Ms. Hecker
would deny that pro-lifers want to
see that kind of result. [...] I would
rather see people control their
lives than appoint myself to con-
trol it for them.

In seriousness, I think people
like Ms. Hecker should stay out
of the debate. In fact, Idon’t think
those who haven't experienced
an unwanted pregnancy should
even think about deciding the
fate of those who will have that

-traumatic experience.-And when A

men. And, if she didn't, wouldn't
she always look back and feel

some regret? You told her not to

and to stick to the man she loves,
and you were right on target.

I wa's’in' her position a couple
of years ago, and, to satisfy my
mind, I had_sex with two other
men. I“t-hought the others would
be different and exciting, but I
found out that it was merely un-
familiar. The experience showed
me I was missing nothing, ‘but it
left me feeling terribly stupid and
guilty. I see one of these men
almost daily," and it is a painful
business. I would have been bet-
ter off with a mildly unsatisfied

- curiosity.

A. Thanks "for endorsing my ad-
vice. I love being told I am right
on target. But I am forced to say
that not every woman who de-
cides to satisfy that curiosity has

exactly the same experience as
you. Some women who are
about to marry, or have been
married for a while, have decid-
ed that sometime in life they must

. try sex with at least one another

man to see what it is like. They

"try it and find it much more exit-

ing'th'an what they were having
with their husbands or fiances.
Maybe tasting the forbiddenfruit
enhances their enjoyment.
Maybe the other guy is technical-
ly a better lover than the
husband. '

The bad thing is that the fling
with that other man interrupts the
growth of mutual trust, love and
sensuality between the commit-
ted couple. In her mind, there is
always that other man. I have so
often heard the woman say, ’’_I
love my husband more; he is a
-finer person and more interesting.
But the other man is more excit-
ing and satisfying sexually.” For
the woman who is building long-
term intimacy with her husband,
it is much easier to bear a little
unsatisfied curiosity than it is to
rid her mind of that destructive
comparison.

vs. Roe vs. Wade

Hecker, all 200 of us have no
right to speak from a position of
no experience to decide some-
thing. that may never affect us per-

sonally. Leave the choice with

those whom it will affect by con-
tinuing to uphold Roe vs. Wade.

You expressed in your article
”Are they covering the news 
” (Monday, Jan. 26, The Pitt
News) that the news editors of the
three major news networks here
in Pittsburgh violate thepeople of
Pittsburgh's ”freedom of choice”
when they decided not to show
the "gory details of R. Budd
Dwyer’s suicide. That if people
did not want to watch the suicide

they could have turned their TV '

set off. But for the rest of you
sadistic people who really get
thrilled by this sort of thing they
should have shown the suicide in
its entirety.

[...] If you and’ all you other
sadistic people who really ”get
off on” or are ”thrilled” by see-
ing others blow [their] heads off,
why don't you all hold your own
news conference (possibly in
The Pitt Newsoffice) and blow
your own heads off with .357
Magnums. Have someone tape it
to be shown on ‘all the major net-
works, and let your families judge
how right or wrong it was to have
the networks show such blood
and gore while they are grieving
over [their loss.] I'm sure Mr.
Dwyer’s family appreciated the
fact that [his]. suicide was not
shown to further embed the gori-.
ness of the tragedy in their
memories. [...]

 PITT NEWS, Wednesday, February 4, I987‘ "

Platoon.

You've seenthem.

The war movies. The ones we
all say we hate, the ones that we
sit aghast at, claiming to be
stunned. I have noticed, though,
that no one goes to the bathroom

_.during the most violent ‘parts.
There must be something really
provocative about the blood.

Another specimen of the war
movie genre was released, and I
imagine there won't be many
trips to the can. It has everything
we've come to expect from a
"good” war movie,

We have blood, split heads,"
live people on fire, co|d—b|ooded
murder (as if there is any other
kind) and, best of all, we have
people on the screen enjoying
the whole thing.

What more could you-want?

You want heros? We got heros.
The heros in this movie are the
people who get out alive. You
want bad guys? We got bad guys.
They're all bad guys. You want
good guys? Sorry, we got no good
guys. Watch the A—Team if you
want to see killers glorified. Pla-
toon has nothing to say in
defense of killing; As a matter of

S MATTHEW
THORNTON

POINT

‘fact, it. has nothing to say in

defense of anything.

Everybody’s a murderer, every-
body’s wrong. That's a damn
shame, but that's the way it was,
or so the many l_iving vets would
have us believe. The vets no
longer living say the same thing,
only louder. .

Platoon gives us something so
rarely seen on the screen. It gives
us reality. Hard, cold reality. The
reality in which men kill each
other not for the glory of their
country or for the progress of
their revolution, but so that they
aren't killed themselves. They
also kill for fun sometimes. Yeah,
it's sick, but it happened. The
whole war was sick, but it
happened. A

We, as a society, need to be
reminded that the Viet Nam War
was more than the college pro-
tests and Nixon's speeches.
Those are the pretty and accept-

a tragedy 

able parts of the war. Those are

‘the parts we don't mind sitting

around with our grandparents
watching. Pretty and acceptable,

maybe, but criminally far from -

the truth.

Such coverage and historical
treatment makes war seem OK,
maybe even an all-right thing to
do again. Hell, we can take a war

when the movies tell us that only _

the bad guys get killed. Every-
body knows they deserved it.
Right?

Wrong.

People die in war. All kinds of
people. The ‘bullets don't care
about the color of skin, the
gender, age or religious convic-
tions of their victims. They don't,

believe it or not, stop to ask about I

the political convictions of their
targets. —
When a filmmaker has the gu
to remove the judgments from
the scriptand to paint the charac-

ters as dark and cold as they real— '

ly are, the film should be shown
to every person in the country.
No one should be denied the
chance to see our base —.and our
real — sides.

 Platoon: a travesty?

There was a movie released last
week that may very well be the
most controversial film in recent
memory. I

It's called Platoon, and it tells
the story of the Viet Nam ex-
perience "like it really was."

I saw the movie on Sunday

night. Anyone who's already

seen it will wholeheartedly agree
— the movie is gut-wrenchingly
powerful. It's graphically violent.
A 10-year-old girl gets raped by
three Gls. American soldiers die
at the hands of other American
soldiers. American soldiers kill
old women and children. Old
women and children kill Ameri-
can soldiers. Viet Nam vets had
‘war everywhere; they didn't
know who was trying to kill them
or where they were hiding. The
anxiety and fear that these men
experienced is well portrayed.

The movie tells the same story
we've heard many times —- one
we can never hear enough of.
War is hell, and there are no ifs,
ands or buts about it.

But.

Do we really need another Viet

The blind students on this cam-
pus need to have things labeled

side of the elevators (to show
what floor one is on) and num-
bers on offices and classrooms.

I had an embarrassing ex-

perience once that speaks clear-
ly of the problems facing blind

students. I didn't know that it was .

the men's room — I accidently
went in.

How is a blind person sup-
posed to know what is what if
things aren't in braille or raised
numbers or letters? There are a lot
of things that could be done for
the blind students on this cam-
pus. I ought to know because I
am a blind student at Pitt.

What are the other things need-
ing to be changed? Well, as-

Also, Roy Rogers in the

‘Cathedral of Learning doesn't

have anyone to assist the blind or
other handicapped students.

The elevators in the Cathedral
of Learning don't have braille
labels on the inside or on the out-
side. That doesn’t make any
sense to me. If you have any con-
sideration for blind and ban-
dicapped students, please at least
put numbers outside the elevator
on the wall.

The book store needs more as-

Right now, the Viet Nam War
gets little coverage _in American
schools. Because it happened so
recently, and history is taught
from the past to the present, the
topic doesn't come up until the
end of the school year. It gets
about a week of coverage, and
then school's over. If a class is be-
hind schedule, Viet Nam may
never be discussed. The kids
know all there is to.know about
the French Revolution, the
American Revolution, the War of
1812 and" even the-Spanish Civil
War. But why don't they know
anything about a war that still

- haunts us? Viet Nam is still touch-

of students who have never
studied it. It's touching all of us.
War is a tragedy we can learn
from. If we come to understand
what starts them, we can learn to
eliminate them. That lesson must

I've noticed that the vending
machines don't have braille
labels on them, also the micro-

’ wave in the Cathedral doesn't

have raised numbering on the
one side. I don't want you to feel

sorry for the students who are A

blind, just to help them.

I know that the other blind stu-
dents must feel the same way. I
don't think it would cost the
university much money, and it
would make things a lot easier for
the blind students “on our
campus.

To all the students who ride the

campus bus, please let the blind
riders sit in the front of the bus.
With a little more considera-
tion from the sighted students,
this university would be an easi-
er and better place for the blind
to learn. And we do want to
learn. -' I

 

'vation of Red M&Ms. The ti-

 

20rniIIion reds
born every

Paul S. Hethmon is feeling
likeachampion these days. As _ I, . _. ._ _
well he should —- how many 5,: ‘___ 4‘  f  , «
among us can say that we've I ‘  
changed the world?

Hethmon, 23, of Knoxville,
Tenn., is chairman of an or-
ganization called The Society
for the Restoration and Preser-

  

tle of the group is

day 

self-explanatory.’

In 1976, the M&M/Mars
Co., based in Hackettstown, N.J., announced that it would no
longer produce red M&Ms. The reason, the company said, was -
”confusion and concern over Red Dye No. 2," which had been
banned by federal regulators as a health risk. '

Now, red M&Ms didn't even contain any Red Dye No. 2.
The red M&Ms got their coloring from red dyes nos. 3 and 40,
which are considered safe. But apparently, the company thought
that its customers might be spooked by the very sight of red '.
M&Ms, assuming them to be dangerous. So, begnning in 1976,
when you ripped open a pack of M&Ms, you could find tan
ones and brown ones and yellow ones and green ones and
orange ones — but no red ones. ‘

In 1976, Hethmon was only 12 years old. "But I noticed that
the red M&Ms were missing right away," he said. ’’I grew up
on-red M&Ms. The red ones were my favorites. I would always
save the red ones till last, so I could savor them.” a

As soon as the red M&Ms disappeared, Hethmon’s life be-
came duller. ”You would open up a bag of M&Ms, and your
immediate impression would be that there were about 40 bil-

lion brown ones in the package,” he said. "It was a really It

depressing sight without the red ones.”

It wasn't so much a matter of taste '— all M&Ms,taste alike,
regardless of color. "How can I explain this?” Hethmon said.
"It was like the difference between seeing The Wizard of Oz
in Technicolor and in black-and-white. That's what M&Ms were
like without the red ones." .

For six years, Hethmon stewed over the situation. The
M&M/Mars Co. was making no move toward reversing its po-
sition; millions of bags of M&Ms continued to be sold, with
nary a red one to be seen. ’ »

But in 1982", when Hethmon became a student at the Univer-

sity of Tennesee, he lept into action.

”There wasn't much to do in college," he said. The age of
student activism was over. "So I decided to start my own or-
ganization."

Thus was The Society for the Restoration and Preservation
of Red M&Ms born. It began with a simple letter from Heth-
mon to the M&M/Mars executive offices. '

"I got a letter back saying that they had enjoyed my letter,"

Hethmon said. ”They also said they had no plans to bring back ‘

the red M&Ms."

So Hethmon put the heat on. He started recruiting members
for his organization, and he organized letter-writing campaigns. ‘
Everyone he met, he urged to write to the M&M/Mars Co. He
went on raido talk shows; he agreed to newspaper interviews.

”The pressure started to build,” he said. ’’I would hear from
children — I got one letter from a 4th-grade class. They said ’
they'd never seen a red M&M. Something like that kind of gets
to you. It kind of chokes your heart." '

It must have choked the heart of the M&M/Mars Co., too. This
month, the firm announced that red M&Ms were being rein-
troduced. Notjust in regular M&Ms, but in peanut M&Ms, too.
From now on, approximately 20 percent of the 100 million
M&Ms made each day will be red.

Hethmon was one of the first to find out about it. "I received
a letter from an M&M/Mars executive named Hans Fiuncyzn-
ski,” Hethmon said. ”The letter began, ’I thinkl have some news
you'll be delighted to hear ...'"”

"I was really elated," Hethmon said. "And very surprised.
I never hadany hint that they were thinking about bringing back
red M&Ms. This came totally out of the blue."

He knows that other people have accomplished more globally
important achievements. But this is good enough to him.-

"Every time I buy a pack of M&Ms, from now until I'm 100
years old, I can tear open the bagand see the red M&Ms pour
into my palm," Hethmon said. ”And I'll know that if it wasn't
for me, those red M&Ms wouldn't be there.”

Lottery—— Nixon fights releaseof Watergate papers

”Practically every large school
has a lottery system in some form
for upperclassmen,” Robinson
stated.

Some colleges use a computer-
ized lottery system. Computers
randomly assign numbers to stu-

,dents, who desire on-campus

housing for the following year.

- ”We’re kind of unique in that
we still have the students draw

the number. You know it's fair‘

and that you had your chance,”
Robinson said.

 However, many people said
that the lottery system is not fair.

ed altogether. There should be

WASHINGTON — Former

his attorney told a federal court
Monday.

”There will be ‘claims of
presidential privilegelodged by

against the entire process,” said
Herbert J. Miller.

The National Archives "gave

A Nixon. lawsuit would be
another in a long string of legal
actions that have blocked the
release of most documents and
hundredsof hours of tape record-
ings, a release ordered by the
Congress more than 12 years ago.
To date, -only two batches of
material have been released by
the archives. Neither involved
sensitive documents. '

Miller was before U.S. District
Judge George H. Revercomb to
support a 1986 Justice Depart-
ment ruling that would force the
archives to accept automatically
every claim of executive privilege
asserted by Nixon against the
release of files. _

Although not mentioned in the
Constitution, executive privilege

ZZZPZPE7

ITHE l>n'r News, ‘Wednesday, February 4, i987

has been claimed by presidents
dating back to George Washing-
ton. By invoking it, a president
claims the right to withhold infor-
mation — including testimony
from key aides —— from public or
congressional scrutiny. The
Supreme Court has refused to
recognize any absolute privilege

in which a president may with— ,

hold information under all cir-
cumstances.

Miller argued that neitherthe
1974 law nor the regulations for
access to the papers drawn up

under that law spell outstandards .

for evaluating Nixon's claims of
executive privilege. He also said
archivists are not competent to
judge such claims, that only the
president or a former president
can do so‘.

But Eric R. Glitzenstein,
representing a public interest
group and a reporters’ organiza-
tion, said, ”Congress did not in-
clude those kinds of processes”
in the law seizing the materials.
”Congress was saying we want
the archives as experts; we want
them to make initial judgments
on disclosure,” he said.

In papers filed with the court,
Glitzenstein said, ”The Justice
Department directive allows
President Nixon, in effect, to
regain primary control over all
the tapes and documents. He can
bar the archives from making any

or all of the materials available to ,

the public merely by asserting ex-
ecutive privilege.” C

Revercomb took the arguments
under advisement.

also accept a position at the
University of Illinois at Chicago
as the associate chancellor and
associate vice president of aca-
demic affairs. ’

”The decision to make the
move to Chicago was a joint one
between my husband and I,’’ said
Daniel. ”We wouldn't have
made the decision to leave if both
of us didn't have satisfying work
to look forward to.”

The Daniels will be leaving be-
hind a lot of personal -history
when they leave Pitt.

The University of Pittsburgh is
where they both attended as un-
dergraduates and where they met
for the first time. That first meet-
ing in the Tuck Shop led to‘23
years of marriage and two chil-
dren for the Daniels. '

Daniel has seen the university
change over the years and said
she will miss it when she's gone.

”The university is certainly a lot
larger now than it was then,” said
Daniel. ”What impresses me
more though is the increased en-
rollment of black students at Pitt.

’’Although I am excited about
the change of careers, it will be
hard to leave Pittsburgh,” said
Daniel. ”The university has
played an important role in" my
life which I will never. forget.”

The university has not yet con-

sidered anyone‘ to fill Jerlean

Daniel's position.

 

”The BigGuy” holding thefortatthe’O.’l

By Niki Harrison
For The Pitt News

”The bigguy in the ’O’ " is one
way of describing Al Mann, secu-

rity ‘guard for the Original Hot

Dog Shop. The ”big guy” is a
comfortable sight, and Pitt stu-
dents feel that Oakland's ”O"
just wouldn't be the same
without him.

Mann said he feels the same
way: ’’I love Oakland — it's the
most exciting place. The ‘O’ is
my life. Pitt students are some of
my best friends.”

Mann has been employed by
the Original Hot Dog Shop for
four and a half years. Previously,
he was in the Navy for eight years
and served in the Military Police.

Mann works Monday through
Sunday, 6:30 p.m. to 4:30 a.m.,
and although any night of the
week in the ”O” is hopping, he
said the most troublesome times
are between 110 p.m. and 4 a.m.
During these hours, Mann has
seen many disagreements, but
few fights;

’’I don't have any fights,” he
said. ”Fights don't start with fists,
words are exchanged first.” Ac-

cording to Mann, most of these —

”litt|e problems” can be resolved
with a few words of persuasion.

He insists that being a good ob-
serverand stepping between the
people and their problems before

Although he said almost any
bad situation can be resolved
with words, he agrees that when
things begin to get rowdy, being
the biggest man present does
make his job easier. —

Pitt and local students sometimes ‘ _ .
”blend in together.” This mixing 

causes the conflict between the
two groups.

THE PITT NEWS

By Matt O'Hara
Staff Writer

Good things come in small
packages.

Standing at only 5-5, junior
point guard Valerie Halesworth is
the shortest member of the Lady
Panther basketball team.

However, she stands tall
among her teammates, as evi-
denced by her being selected as
a team tri—captain.

"I'm comfortable with my role
as a leader," said Halesworth. "I
just wish I could lead the team to
more wins.” The Lady Panthers
are a dismal 5-15 overall, 0-10 in
the Big East.

Statistically, Halesworth has
had a fairly successful season.
She leads the Lady Panthers in
shooting at 51.1 percent, while
hitting over 75 percent of her
free—throw attempts.

Halesworth leads the team with

84 assists, just over four per
game, and her 37 steals place her
among the top in the conference.

Unfortunately, though, she is
one of the league's leaders with
97 turnovers. "I’m getting better.

At the beginning of the year, I

averaged about six [turnovers] a
game, lately I've been around
three or four,”
added.

These turnovers are not entire-
ly her own doing. The team has

Overall, Ha|esworth’s stats are

head coach Kirk Bruce is interest-
ed in more than points and as-
sists. "Valerie could run the team
much better than she has been.
She's playing at about _5O percent,
which is scary,” said Bruce, who
feels his point guard hasn't real-

ized her potential.

Halesworth agrees, "Coach is
100-percent right. I don't think
I've been hard enough on myself
or the rest of the team. '

”I need to take charge on the
court. It's my job to be an exten-
tion of [Bruce] on the floor. I real-
ly like the responsibility — it
makes me tough,” she said.

Halesworth is aware that Bruce
hasn't been altogether pleased

Panthers

By Thomas Danyluk

Assistant Sports Editor

It's hard to believe, but there
are only eight games remain-
ing on the Pitt Panthers’
basketball schedule. Go ahead
and subtract tonight's match-
up with Rollie Massimino’s

Villanova Wildcats in
Philadelphia from that grand
total.

Still, a look from the basket-
ball purist's point of view re-
veals a league to be
conquered — the Big East, of
course. And Pitt, finally, has
placed itself in a position _to
take a cake that has been out
of even Charlie Smith's reach
for the past few seasons.

This isnot a laughing mat-
ter. Pitt has compiled an im-
pressive 6-2 conference record
and currently stands tied for
first place with Syracuse and
Providence. Paul Evans has
taken this perennial blunder-
bust and turned it into a can-
non directed at the league title.

It's Tuesday's practice.
_Evans is absent from the scene,
away on a recruiting mission.
His assistant and right-hand
man, Norm Law, is in com-
mand of the workout. And he
makes damn sure nobody
takes the day off.

While working five—on-five
drills, the starting unit casual-
ly blows two consecutive fast-
break opportunities.

So Law, casually, sends
them to the baseline for a
winding suicide. (suicide — a
zig—zag; a series of sprints
which vary in length; a real
pain in the blank.)

Flying
h

"We've really worked hard a

ope to

“to get where we are,” stressed

Law. "We've been going at it
since October, and there's no
room for letdown/" After a
quiet outbreak of huffed
curses, the players seem to get
the point. .
Can you remember that Il-
linois game, a disappointing
but typical Panther defeat?

. "Just like old times,” everyone

secretly said to themselves.
But aside from a get—it—out—of-
the-system loss to Brigham
Young, Evans’ team has been
on a tear. Only stingy St.
John's and Georgetown have
outscored Pitt in 1987. Those
rematches loom on the
horizon. And although the
coaches are openly concerned"

with only Villanova at the mo-

ment, no one forgets where
the hatchet is buried.

Here's a debatable question:
Who exactly is Pitt's toughest
opponent in the schizophren-
ic Big East? The Panthers have
proven themselves dominant
to justabout everyone. Well,
Law has an interesting answer.

”To tell the truth, the tough-
est opponent is [ourselves],"
he said confidently. "We've
gone out and proven ourselves
to a lot of people. Look who
we've beaten. If we do the
things we're capable of doing,
we can play with anyone. It's
been our own mistakes that
have hurt us."

On that note, let's take pre-
postseason inventory and
what the club's starters have to
offer.

Superstars — Jerome Lane
and Charles Smith have ar-
rived as top—notch ballplayers.

 Penguins’ Berry in danger of losing coaching position

PITTSBURGH (AP) — According to pub-
lished reports, Bob Berry's job as coach of
the Pittsburgh Penguins may be in jeopardy
following an 8-6 loss to Hartford in which

the Penguins allowed three final-period’

goals in less than three minutes.

Paul Martha told the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette that club owner Edward J. DeBar—
tolo "is not happy" about the Penguins’
nose dive into last place in the NHL’s
Patrick-«Division despite their 7-0 start.

"The full impact of our owner's feelings
and impressions have been felt in Pittsburgh
— the full impact,” Martha said.

Martha said he could not assure Berry that
he would still be the coach for Thursday's

game at Boston.

"You never know about that,” Martha
said, acknowledging that Berry's status is
"day-to-day." -

Berry, the former Montreal Canadiens
coach, said he is aware of his precarious sit-
uation. '

"[Sunday] night, I went to bed feeling like
an elephant on the edge of a cliff tied to a
dandelion," he said. "

DeBartolo, who lives in Youngstown,
Ohio, called Martha on Monday morning
to complain about the Hartford defeat. The
phone call was followed by meetings
among Berry, his players, Martha and
General Manager Eddie Johnston.

However, both Johnston and Marthatold
The Pittsburgh Press that no coaching
change is planned, at least for now.

”We’re not looking to change coaches,"
Johnston said. "We lost Sunday on a cou-
ple of late errors at the end of shifts. Coach-
ing did not play a part."

"We are planning no change," Martha
said. "Not that I'm aware of. We've had a
tough road,'now we've got to go about the
business of making the playoffs.”

The Penguins, who haven't made the
NHL playoffs since 1982, remain four
games behind the fourth-place New York
Rangers in the Patrick Division. They have

lost seven of their last nine games and have

only four victories in their last 22 games.

Martha said the Hartford defeat, in which
the Penguins rallied for a 6-5 lead after trail-
ing 4-1, might have' been the worst of the
season.

"There are losses, and there are |osses,"
Martha said. "That was a difficult loss to
take. We came back from a big deficit to
take the lead. Normally, you win those
games at home.” ‘

Berry, who was hired in June 1984 fol-
lowing his firing by the Canadiens, has a
77-113-21 record in Pittsburgh. He has a’
nine-year record of 300-2 78-96 with the Los
Angeles Kings (1978-81), Canadiens
(1981 -84) and Penguins.

faction from proving his former
boss wrong. For one of the few
times in his career, he finds him-
self on a team that doesn't appear
to be good enough to survive past
the first round of the playoffs.

The Bullets recently went
through a streak of six losses af-
ter reaching the .500 mark, a lev-
el they have danced around all
season.

The inconsistency of the Bullets
is frustrating to Malone, who just
four years ago was on a Philadel-
phia team judged to be among
the greatest of all time.

”We’ve got to come to every‘
game prepared and get a six- or

‘ seven-game streak going,” Ma-

lone said. ”Whether you play
one minute or 48, everybody’s

got to work hard.

”We can't keep getting to .500
and then losing. We've got to get -
overthat,” he added.

Malone isn't sorry his days of

"feuding with Katz are behind

him, but he certainly misses the
76ers’ winning ways.

”We refused to lose two games
in a row,” he said. ”Here we just
seem willing to go out and try to
win one. I want to be there [in the
playoffs] in June again. I've been"
there, and I know what it's like.”

So far, the Bullets have not
done well with a Twin Towers
alignment, a concept so success-
ful at Houston and Boston.

Manute Bol, 7-6, who set a
rookie record for blocked shots
and threatened the all-time,
single-season mark last season,
rarely sees action at the same
time as Malone,

”They have not played well at
all when they've been in there
together,” Bullets coach Kevin
Loughery said. ”We always seem
to lose_ground when they're in
there at the same time. Conse-
quently, the one who loses play-
ing time is Manute”. '

Malone’s intensity, always im-
pressive, was raised another
notch in Washington's two meet-'
ings with the 76ers this season,
both won by the Bullets.

He had 28 points and 21 re-
bounds in the first game in
Philadelphia on Christmas Day;
then he had 39 points and 17 re-
bounds in a rematch at Landover,
Md., Jan. 10.

Two nights later, he had a
seasoh-high 41 points and 20 re-
bounds in a victory over
Sacramento. .

”My game is hard work and
pride,” Malone said. ”On the all
hard-work team, I'd pick myself

centration. It's a thinking game.
Be wise. Study them [opponents],
what they do best. If I get too
Hollywood, I might lose it.”

Washington's fortunes seem to
rise and fall with Malone.

In a five-game stretch early in
the season, his lines showed:
38 points and 21 rebounds, 31
points and 11 rebounds, 34
points and 13 rebounds, 17
points and 14 rebounds and 32
points and 11 rebounds.

The only game the Bullets lost
of those five" was the one in
which he scored 17.

Malone, in the fifth year of a
six-year contract that pays him

more than $2 million a year,‘

shrugs off the notion that he's the
highest-salaried person in
Washington.

”Not me,” he said. ”That’s my
wife.”

Some believed his poor rela-
tionshipwith Katz had soured
Malone on playing in Philadel-
phia, but former 76ers teammate
Maurice Cheeks said Malone
could have flourished with the
76ers‘.

' ”He didn't need the change of
scenery,” Cheeks said. ”He’s
such a competitor that he would
play anywhere.”

AirJordan not only key for

By James Litke
AP Sports Writer

CHICAGO — Doug Collins
was mugged by a Russian play-
er, slugged by a teammate and
bugged by reporters — all for the
sake of the game.

He absorbed more punishment
on the court than a playground
basketball. As a coach,.he’s had

to deal with a different sort of
, pummeling.

”lt’s been frustrating at times;
winning still feels way too good,
losing way too bad,” Collins said
as he assessed his first half-season
as an NBA head coach. ”But I
honestly don't think there's too
many things I'd go back and do
differently, even if I could.’’

Collinsalready has fulfilled his

prediction to raise the lowly Bulls
to the .500 plateau _— a
pronouncement reporters used to
chide him about.
‘ ”I’m not an impulsive person.
I usually don't do things I'll end
up regretting,” Collins said,
smiling.

Collins is the 11th head coach
in the franchise's 21-year history,
the seventh in the last six seasons
and the third since owner Jerry
Reinsdorf bought the club in
March 1985.

”Doug knows the grind, the

low spots  what it's like to have
an injury end your career. He
knows hovv to get respect, and he
knows how to give it. That's what
makes guys play for you,” said
Jerry Krause, the Bulls vice presi-
dent who axed Stan Albeck last
May and then hired Collins out
of the CBS broadcast booth.

”Peop|e figure, ’He’s got
Michael Jordan; he just pencils
him in, and the Bulls win,’ ” said
Krause, ”But that's nonsense.”

At 35, Collins is rail-thin and
looks as fit as he did during an
eight-year playing career with the
Sixers. He rarely runs the floor in
practice, but his ballplayers don't
doubt he could. I

"His enthusiasm has carried
over into the way we've played,”
said Bulls guard John Paxson, an
overachiever in the Collins mold.
”I remember watching him play,
and he was aggressive and hard-
working. This team has the same
attitude, and it's a reflection of his
personality.”

Collins was an unremarkable
athlete through his junior year of
high school, which he ended as
a chunky 5-9 reserve on the
basketball team.

But a summer bout with
mononucleosis ”had some

. strange effect on my metabolism

and shot me up to 6-2,” he

recalled. ”I also became totally
committed tq_becoming a good
basketball player.”

He averaged 26 points per
game his final year of high school
and chose Illinois State over 100
other suitors. By the time Collins
arrived on campus, he had grown
to 6-6 and had the skills to match.

After a 32.6-ppg season as a
junior,.Collins made the 1972
U.S. Olympic team and headed
to Munich for a much-anticipated
showdown with the Soviets.

It came early on - Sept. 10,
1972. The Soviets had the ball, a
49-48 lead and needed only to
protect it for 10 seconds more to
snap the Americans’ 62.-0 Olym-
pic record — seven consecutive
gold medals dating back to 1936.

But Collins intercepted a Soviet
pass, tipped the ball upcourt, ran
itdown and closed in on a layup.
Sako Sakandelidze caught him
from behind and rammed him
into the basket support.

Collins was unconscious for 15
seconds, and woozy kwhen he
made both free throws with three
seconds left. The Soviets in-
bounded the ball, and a desper-
ation 40-footer by Sasha Belov
missed as the horn sounded.

But a protest from Soviet Coach
Vladmir Kondrashkin restored
three seconds to the game clock.

Before the buzzer sounded a se-
cond time, a- length—of-the-floor
pass and a Belov layup had end-
ed Collins’ Olympic dream.

The 76ers made Collins the
No. 1 pick in the next collegiate‘
draft, and three years later, in the

- 1975-76 season, he earned the
first of four consecutive All-Star
team selections.

The addition of Julius Erving
made the 76ers finalists for the
NBA title in the 1976-77 season.

Philadelphia never hit those

» heights again during Collins’
playing days. By the end of the
1977-78 season, “he began ex-
periencing back spasms, what he
called ”the first of my chronic
health problems.”

Over the next "two seasons,
stress fractures in his feet forced
Collins to miss 81 games. Just 12
games into the 1980-81 season,
with seven operations behind
him and an uncertain future, Col-
lins called it quits.

He moved. into the broadcast
booth, then put in two stints as an
assistant coach under Bob Wein-
hauer at both Penn and Arizona
State.

Collins’ broadcasting career
with CBS was taking off when the
Bulls‘ called. .

”It’s a challenge,” he said.
”Even as a high school kid, I was

thing Pitt hasn't done much of
this season. According to '
Halesworth, though, the Lady
Panthers could be tough in the
Big East Tournament. ”We’re
really struggling this year, but
we're always tough at tourna-
ment time,” said Halesworth.
”Teams are scared of us because
they can't tell how well we're go-
ing to play." ‘

Halesworth is no stranger to,
success. While attending high
school in Oyster Bay, N.Y., she
attained All-/Long Island and All-
New York status in both field
hockey and basketball.

She looked at several schools,

including Missouri, Southern

Methodist University and Old
Dominion, but, Pitt was the place
for her.

”l came to Pitt for two reasons. i
The academic program was at
least equal to the other schools,
and I knew it would help me to
be able to graduate in four
years,” said Halesworth. ”But,
the main reason I came here was '
because of the people. When I
visited, everyone was so friendly
and sincere. I loved it.”

LADY PANTHER NOTES: Pitt
freshman guard Jen Shingler was
named Big East Freshman of the
Week for her play last week.

Shingler scored a total of 32

- points in losses to Providence

and Connecticut.

The Lady Panthers travel to
Philadelphia tonight to play the
Villanova Wildcats. Villanova
defeated Pitt at Fitzgerald Field
House earlier‘ in the season
92-73. ’

Brookin cookin’ off the bench for. Evans

By Chistopher Sepesy

Assistant Sports Editor

Rod Brookin has become the
kind of player every coach
dreams of having — tough, talent-
ed and dependable. -

And his presence lately as th
Panthers’ sixth man is not going
unrewarded. After‘ scoring 38
points in the three games last
week against Syracuse, Seton
Hall and Connecticut, Brookin, a
6-5 forward, was named Big East
Freshman Player of the Week.

Brookin has ‘averaged 8.5
points in Big East games and has
scored in double figures in six
games, including a career high of
.19 against Chicago State.

Not bad for someone who,
coming into the season, "wasn't
sure” if he could keep up with his
teammates. c‘

”I had heard of Charles Smith
and Demetreus Gore and had
watched them on _television,”
said Brookin. ”The thought of
playing on the same team as
them really kind of scared me.
But now that I know what it is
like, I couldn't ask for anything
better. We’re'al| family on this
team, and nobody likes to let any-
body else fail or get down. I think
that is why we all work so well
together in a game.”

Brookin came to Pitt from the

. Harrisburg suburb high school of

923% DER?

Stee|ton—Highspire, where he ba-
sically broke every basketball
record in the school's history. As
a .four—year starter, he averaged
23.6 points per game and is the
school's all—time leading scorer
-.w.i th...2.,.C).49. . poi.r1ts.,. as .wel I... as i.ts
all—time leading rebounder with
1,186.
But he knew college ball
would be different.

”It really was a big adjustment
for me, but I really knew that it
would be,” said Brookin. ”I knew
I wouldn't be scoring as much as
I did, so I committed myselfto the
idea that I would help my new
team out as much as I could.”

No one could ever accuse
Brookin of not helping his new
team. While he seemed a little in-
timidated by some of the oppo-
sition at the start of the season, he

 

has developed his anxieties into
serious, no—frills, dependable
play.

”Rod has improved so much
that I have a hard time believing
what I'm seeing sometimes,” said
Pitt head coach Paul Evans re-
cently. ”He really goes out and
plays his heart out every time I
put him in a game. He has fit
himself into the team extremely
well.”

Brookin is the only Pitt recruit
out of four not victimized this
year by Rule 48. This is the new
NCAA ruling which prohibits any
freshman athlete from playing un-
less a C average is maintained in
high school as well as a com-
bined score of 700 on the SAT.

Brookin attributes this to his
mother, who stressed academics
while he was in high school. But
the new driving force in his life
is Paul Evans.

”Coach Evans is the kind of
coach we all need,” said
Brookin. ”He tells it straight and
is really hurt when you mess up.
I will go out of my way to do
things his way because I know he
always is telling me the right
things to do.”

With more than half of the sea-
son over, Brookin is not looking

I for any breaks or easy routes.

Even though the team is on a roll
lately, he knows it still has a long,
hard climb to the top — and he
is prepared.

”I think I've worked hard to-
, receive the things I have so far,

and I intend to keep doing the

13

same,” commented Brookin. ’’I
really am happy right now, but I'll
be at my happiest when we win
the Big East title, and I have that
big, fat ring on my finger!”

Sanchez was tops on the high
bar. On the parallel bars, Gonza-
lez and Powanda finished second
and third, respectively. '
”The meet was a complete

team effort/’.said Sanchez. ”We 

stuck together and hit our

- routines.” ~

For the past several years, an
all-around from Pitt has won the
individual title at meets. This year

, was no different. The all-around

winner was Gonzalez, a fresh-

. man, who’ beat out his closest

competitor by one—tenth of a
point, with a total score of 52.].

Despite the victory, Pitt con-
tinues to be plagued by injuries.

Panther freshman al|—arounder ,

Brock Freehling who sprained his
ankle last week,'made finals but i‘

didn't compete. ”My ankle was
swollen, and I didn't want to fur-

”Besides, we had already won
the meet.” Another all—arounder,
Pat Pollaci, injured himself while
performing on the rings. Pollaci,
a freshman, slipped off and in-
jured his back but remained in
the meet.

The Panthers next meet is this
Friday at Kent State, and the gym-

nasts are confident. Sanchez said,-

’’If we perform like we did last
Saturday, we should do well.”

THE PITTNEWS, Wednesday February 4, 1937 .

By Beth Froelich

Staff Writer

The Lady Panther swim team
posted a big 140-120 win over
the Ohio State Buckeyes in an
away meet thispast weekend.

"Ohio swam well, but we
swam better,” said Pitt Coach
David Belowich. "We really
wanted to win this one. Ohio
State provided tough competi-
tion, and our girls had to race to
the wall in order to beat them."

Senior Jodi O'Neil was one of
the outstanding swimmers of the
day. She swam consistently to
three first-place finishes in the
100-yard breaststroke, 200-yard
breaststroke and the 400-yard in-

dividual medley.

O'Neil was also part of the
winning 200-yard medley relay
team consisting of freshman San-
dy Albright, freshman Laurie
Walczak and ‘senior Sue
Hickman.

. "In regard to where we're at
right now in our season, l_was
very pleased with my perfor-
mance," said O'Neil. "At this

2 point in the season, our times are

starting to come down as we pre-
pare for the Big East Champi-
onships."

"This was a good win for us be-
cause Ohio is a tough team to

FRIDAY the 13th
Come see
Circus of Death,    

beat," continued O'Neil. "This
win sets us up nicely for Brown
next week, which will also be a
tough meet."

Coach Belowich counts, on
sophomore Tricia Rickert to be a
versatile asset to the Panther
swimming program.

Rickert came through with a lot
of versatility this weekend, swim-
ming two very different and
demanding events.

First the grueling long-distance
1,000—yard freestyle, in which she
placed second to Jonelle Bosse of
Ohio State. Rickert hadn't swam
the event competitively in over a
year. ' 1

Next, Rickert had to compete

in the fast-paced .100-yard
freestyle, in which she took first
place. '
8, Freshman Laurie Walczak also
had a good day, capturing a first-
place finish in the 100-yard but-
terfly and second place in the
50-yard freestyle.

ln diving, the Lady Panthers

faced heavy competition from the '

Buckeyes, recognized as one of
the strongest programs in the East;
9 Ohio State's Karen Laface
edged out her Panther competi-
tion, winning both the 1_- and
3-meter diving competitions.
Pitt's divers proved themselves
none-too-shabby regardless.

 

Freshman Candy Yackmack
placed second on the 1-meter
board, followed by junior and
sophomore teammates Cathy
McDonald and Margie Paulick.

In the 3-meter diving competi-
tion, Paulick tooksecond while
Yackmack took fourth.

”Ohio State has some really
good divers," said Yackmack.

"Brown will be, tough too. I was

very pleased with the way I dove
on the 1—meter board."

"On the 3-meter board though,
I wasn't comfortable at all and
therefore didn't dive well,” con-
tinued Yackmack. ’'I think we'll
all be diving better by the time
the Big East Championships roll
around."

thers will .f_in.i.sh their dual meet

 

 O’Neil '5 three fi rst—Place finishes lead Pitt

Brown is the defending Eastern

Pitt swimmers will have to swim
especially well to win.

"The Brown meet will be too
close to call," said Belowich.
"Win, lose or call, it will be good
preparation for the Big East
Championships."
