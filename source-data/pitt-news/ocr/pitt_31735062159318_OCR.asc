hest Drive Opens at Center;

‘C’ Day is here!
‘C’ Day, Contribution Day

for the Pitt Chest Fund Drive,

today at Ellsworth Center and tomorrow in the Cathedral.
Rounding out a concentrated publicity campaign that kept

the Fund Drive in the campus limelight for three weeks, stu-

dent speakers will bring it to a climax when they distribute

the collection envelopes. At
will oe taken during all English
classes today. In the Cathedral
speakers will visit classrooms dur-
ing the third and sixth hours to-
morrow.

The speakers met last Thursday
in Stephen Foster Memorial‘ for a
box luncheon. Dr. Demas Barnes
and committee members briefed the
volunteer speakers and a movie
was shown explaining activities
of agencies included in the Fund.

Andy Schurman, chairman of the
speakers division, reported a hi
enthusiasm shown by his volunte
brigade. About 290 students h
offered their services and thos
tending the luncheon made

vided for the entry of the amount
of any donation during the collec-
tion or a pledging. All or part of
the amount may be paid by Dec. 1
for the Fall drive or by March 1 for
the Spring drive.

Conbined Drive

Committeemen are emphasizing
that this Drive includes all the
benefit organizations that would
normally draw on the student body
in numerous separate appeals. It is
the only such drive to be held in
the entire school year. Almost 100
organizations are represented, 92
of them being grouped under the
heading of Community Chest. Other
agencies supplied by the Fund are
Men's CouncilLoan Fund, Women's
Loan Fund, World Student Service
Fund, Red Cross, March of Dimes,
CARE, and the United Negro Col-
lege Fund.

It is hoped by the committee that
every student will be wearing an
‘I Gave’ button, which are to be
given out by speakers to all who
contributed. To those students who
may find it difficult to meet the $4
individual goal, committeemen send
an appealfor any possible donation.

Small Donations Acceptable

Smaller donations will be needed
in view of the several obstacles
the drive faces this year. Contribu-
tion Day comes atatime when most
of the veterans will have not yet
received their checks. Although
the checks usually arrive on the
first of the month, they often are

ill the Chest?

its ,
The Pitt Chest committee 1S on sort of a spot today and to-

: morrow as it seeks to fill its‘ coffers.
J J The one crack it has at the student body this year comes at
 »a time when the dollar supply is shrinking amid the rocky eco-
 , nomic... situation threatening us today. While the constricting fin-
- ancial condition hasn’t, in most cases, touched the student
, ‘directly yet, it does caution him to take a little tighter hold on
 op ‘his wallet and cut down his luxury spending.
'3 Let’s hope he doesn’t include the Chest in this category. If
p  he does,.he will be hurting a worthwhile campaign at a time when
7" it, more than ever, needs to succeed. The present unsettled sit-
uation, although providing a stumbling block that the campaign
must thrust aside, heightens the demands made on some of the
\ charities the drive helps to support. .
In urging student support of the Chest, we have already pub-
P lished a series of articles illustrating the uses your contributions
-are put to some of the organizations participating in the drive.

 
  

Repetition is unnecessary.The worthiness ofeach member agency
was considered ina screening that preceded incorporation as a
' sharing member of the Chest proceeds.

The student might, however, bear in mind that the Chest’s
invasion of classrooms will be the only touch placed on him this
school year. This putting of all the eggs in one basket has made
giving more pleasant the past three semesters. '

The student who can afford the two-buck contribution request
the Chest has made can shell it out, knowing that his money will
be divided among beneﬁcial agencies and that he’s made his char-

I City offering for the year.

C-day, as you undoubtedly guessed long ago, stands for Con-
tribution-day. It could have a double meaning tomorrow. That is,
it could designate "Character-day,” when the traits of the Pitt

A‘ population can be examined to see if generosity toward the less
fortunate part of its makeup.

The Play’s the Thing ,

The Pitt Players make their bid for student interest this
week. They open their first production of the year, "Arsenic and
» (Old Lace,” Thursday night in Stephen Foster Memorial.
 Here at Pitt, the dramatic organization is strictly an activity,
’ ‘yet the Players have consistently Selected popular plays and
p  I presented them with an air of professionalism that has been appre-
it ciated by their audience. Over at Carnegie Tech, drama is part
J’  of the school curriculum. The Tech plays should be handled with
" the expected perfection, and, we understand, usually are.
The Pitt actors, nonetheless, have drawn favorable compari-
, sons with the Skibo dramats in the past and should continue to
 do so in the future. The four-presentation schedule laid out for
this year, which follows this week's run with "Caste,” “Julius
Caesar,”.and a musical, along the lines of a now-defunct Cap
and Gown show plus coeds, should attract the student playgoers
: in rewarding numbers.

.Not So Small
I Who said the University has one of the smallest, in area,
campuses in the country? Well, maybe they aren’t too far wrong.

If it takes a bus to get students to, the far-reaches of the
campus, it must be a king-sized campus. With the additions of

campus has spread. ‘It used to be just the Cathedral and the

Flashbacks

12 Years Ago 

A no smoking rejgulation was put
in effect. “All persons entering
the Cathedral of learning are re-
spectfully asked to preserve the
atmosphere of dignity and of good
manners which students and fac-
ulty here desire. In particular, they
are requested not to smoke in the
Commons Room or in any class
room, laboratory, library, corridor
toilet, or elevator in the building.
Rooms for smoking are provided on
the second and eighth floors.”

The no smoking rule was sup-'

posed to be an air-conditioning
measure.

rated professors from four stars for

ceived mixed criticism from assor-

How’s That Again Dept. From the
Penn State Collegian comes this
fascinating news note. “Larry
Cooney has succeeded in adding a
new twist to the usual jewelry ex-
change system. During his past
week-end date the conversation got
around to the practice of pinning.
Said she: "I don’t want to be pinned;
I want to be ‘watched’ -— by you,”
and she proceeded to relieve him
of his wrist watch. Quite a timely
gesture.

This bit of by-play occurred in
‘an economics class at Temple:
A professor’s biting boxer was re-
sponsible for the uproar in his econ
class. The prof looked slightly be-
wildered as he called his class to
order -- because of the absence of
his spectacles. Explaining the situ-
ation, he said,, "Class, this morn-
ing something different happened
to me -- I woke up....(barrage of
laughter) '. and heard a crunching
sound.”

Wiseacre: “Crackers in bed?"

Prof: “No, not that, ‘but worse.
My pet boxer chewed up my glasses
and I can’: see a thing.”

Two students, grasping the situ-
ation, made a fast getaway. The
professor claims that this is not
the first time that his mutt engaged
in these tactics. He once caught
the dog chewing on his pocket watch.
"It still keeps good time, though,”
said the prof.

who had done it before they re-

I am a student at the University,

face the same situation every morn-

that no matter howearly you arrive,
there are no places to park. Of
course there are many illegal
places which one can take a chance
on; or pay an exorbitant amount to
the parking lot. My peeve is; why
doesn’t the University do something
about the parking problem for stu-'

should have its own lot,and charge

°Arse11ic and Old Lace’ Opens

Three-Night Stand Thursday 

By CLAIRE BRACKMANN
Homicidal mania isn’t much fun unless it’s in "Arsenic and
Old Lace,” the comedy being presented by the Pitt Players this
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at the Stephen Foster Memorial.
The play by Joseph Kesselring is about the Brewsters of
Brooklyn. The two Brewster sisters, Abby and Martha, plump

elderly women with Victorian charm,
and a mania for murder, are played
by Anatalie Gefsky and Cecelia
Boodman.

Charles Mitchell Waterman plays
the part of their nephew, Teddy,
who thinks he is Theodore Roose-
velt. In keeping with the family
trend toward insanity, Jonathan
Brewster, played by Ben Tatar, has
escaped from a sanitarium and come
to call on his relatives.

The only sane member of the
family is Mortimer Brewster,played
by Don Sommers. As a drama critic
for the local paper,he is constantly
being bothered by Officer O'Hara,
a frustrated playwright, played by
Dan Gardner.

Robert Fogg has the role of Rev.
Dr. Harper, rector of the nearby
church. Jeannette Tambelici plays
Elaine, his attractive daughter.

DEAN THEODORE W. BIDDLE

   

The clean received a bachelor’s
degree from Pitt in economics in
1929, intending to go into indus-
trial labor relations. When he was
offered a position as assistant to
the Dean of Men, however, he
couldn't turn it down. "My associ-
ation with the university had been
such a pleasant one that I couldn’t
resist the urge to continue it,” he
says. He did every manner of work
as an assistant, working with dif-
ferent student organizations and ad-
vising fraternities. In 1936, he re-
ceived his master’s degree in edu-
cation. ‘

Ohio, 27-8

3)’ STANLEY SKIRBOLL

The Pitt frosh ran their grid vic-
tories to two straight Saturday, by
defeating the Ohio University, 27-8,
before some 200 fans at the Stadium.

Coach Ted Schmitt now has two
weeks in which to prepare his
charges for their toughest game of
the season, the Cadets of Army.

The undefeated Panther first-year
men were never behind in their sec-
ond contest, although the Fighting
Bobcats did scare the Pitt team
when they came within five points
late in the third
quarter.

Much better pass-
ing protection and
better downfield
blocking, coupled
with the excep-
.3 tional Pitt de-
fense, kept the
Ohioans from cap-
italizing on their
 tricky offense.
 There were times
that all four Ohio
backfield men handled the ball on
a single play, but they were never
able to get off the long runs that
featured the Pitt attack.

Capp Stars '

it was a native of Ohio, but a
Pitt player, that kept the Bobcats
winless in their second consecu-
tive start. ]oe Capp ofNewton Falls
was the Pitt sparkplug this week,
scoring twice and passing effec-
tively.

Capp’s first TD, and the initial
tally of the game, was a beautiful.
twisting run of 36 yards on a fake
pass play. His second score came
on a lateral from Frank Guadagninq.
Capp took the ball on the 25, but
only after the fullback had advanced
the ball from the 42.

Guadagnino’s Third

Guadagnino kept up his splendid
play, scoring on aseven-yard plunge
through center. It was his .third
touchdown of the season.

The final Pitt score came on an-
other brilliant run, a 70-yard dash
by Warren (Rabbit) ‘Walton. \lalton’s
return of an Ohio punt came with
only 45 seconds left in the game.

Ohio’s eight points came on a
blocked punt for a safety and a
80 yard return of the safety kickoff.

Slow Game

The game itself was slowed up
with continual penalties and fre-
quent fumbles. Sustained drives
were,'on the whole, impossible with
every drive started set back by rule
infractions or bobbles.

Spearheading the Blue and Gold
defense was Merle l)eLuca, who,
except on a few occasions, played
line-backer. Gabriel Gembrowsky,
Joe Kurtick, and Norman Chizmar
were also stalwarts on defense.

Side Lines--

Not one of the 200 spectators pre-
sent at the game left until about
five minutes after the contest ended.
(Reason: all were listening to the
thrilling varsity win on radios.

    

.Joé capo

There were times that the frosh
looked up in amazement at the
crowd. Nothing spectacular was
happening down on the field, but
the fans were cheering. Reason:
Pitt had just scored against Penn.

Joe Scalzo kicked three extra

points for Pitt, missing only on one
attempt.

JAYVEE FIND"—The junior

Bill may find himself in varsity
esota, and Penn State contests.

Bill takes great pride and pleas-
ure in pasting an enemy ball car-
rier with one of his sharp, forceful
tackles. Life wouldn’tbe worth liv-
ing if you couldn't mix defensive
duties with offensive ones, is the
outlook of this young varsity aspi-
rant.

Has Varsity Potential

So far this year Bill's lineback-
ing alone has labeled him potential
varsity material. If he continues
at this pace his name is sure to
appear in the 1950 Pitt program.

I-lis hard tackles were very in-
strumental in the jayvees first win
over Geneva. \

Bill rapped his speciality on the
Geneva fullback in the third quar-
ter, causing him to fumble. Pitt re-
covered on the Covies 30 yard line.
From there he engineered the tie-
ing touchdown in five plays.

Affection for Frosh

Bill gai_ns almost as much en-
joyment out of scrimmaging the
freshmen, constant sparring part-
ners of the junior varsity, as he
does playing the regular jayvee op-
ponents.

He seems to have a very austere
feeling toward the frosh. On one

Should you hear some freshman back complaining bitterly about a

‘Poison   Ivy’  Panthers Up Again

Gridders Notch Fifth Win;
Tough Bucks Loom Ahead

B3 JOHN MEGELLA
PHILADELPHIA, Pa. —- After being the poison among the Ivy
by defeating unbeaten Penn, 22-21, at Franklin Field Saturday,
Mike Milligan’s Panthers look with an avenging eye to this week’s
game with the Buckeyes of Ohio State.

Last

year Coach Wes Fesler’s
T eleven trampled the Panthers,
41-0, at Columbus. And the 1949

edition of the Ohio State team has
the same scoring potential aslthat
of last year. To date, OSU has
beaten Missouri, Indiana, Wisconsin,
and Northwestern wh.le losing to
Minnesota and tying Southern Cal-
ifornia.

The Buckeyes have an ever-threat-
ening passing attack. Quarterback
Pandle Savic and llalfbacks Jim
Clark and Jerry Krall all pass and
have more than a capable receiver
in Ray llamilton, a speedy halfback.

O hio State's passing attack should
be just as menacing as the Penn
variety.

To stop this attack the Panther
defense will have to be more effec-
tive than it was in the Quaker game.
Penn completed 14 passes out of
26 for 161 yards. One, from Red
Bagnell to Bill Rhoads, was‘ good
for a T1), and two others by Bagnell
to Warren llorton led to TD’s.

Penn found the airways more to
their liking after being held in check
by the Pitt line.The Quakers gained
a net of 80 yards rushing. Bulwarks
of the Panther defense up front were
Nick Bolkovac, Bill Samer, Len
Radnor, Bernie Barkouskie, and
Bill Gasparovic.

Doctor Jesse Quatse, line coach,
said that he was more than pleased
with Saturday’s line play. Referring

to Guard Bernie Barkouskie’s block-

of Ray Uooney’s punt, which ac-
counted for Pitt's victory, Dr.
Quatse said, "That shows you what
a fast charging line can do. They
had been playing ball like that all
afternoon.”

The Panthers loosened an aerial
barrage of their own against" the
Quakers. Among others, Bimbo Cec-
coni threwa 48 yard touchdown pass
to Jimmy Joe Robinson late in the
first quarter. Nick Bolkovac failed
in his conversion attempt.

The second quarter was only four
minutes old when Cecconi threw a

(Cont. on Page 6)

Bolkovac Blocks;

Cecconi Rolls

PHILADELPHIA, Pa, — Nick
Bolkovac, who could very easily
have been the goat of Saturday’s
game because of his miss on the
first extra-point try, came through
when the chips were down.

It was Nick’s block that shook’
Lou Cecconi loose on his 53 yard
punt return in the final Pitt drive
which eventually set up the safety.

Cecconi took the punt on his
own 18, faked one Quaker out on
the 25 and came straight up the
center to the 30 where he cut to
the North sideline. Here's where
Bolkovac made his key block on a o
Penn man and Bimbo was off for
points west.

Nick and the rest of the squad
thought that the game was awful
rough but not dirty like the West
Virginia contest.

Asked what he thought of John ‘
"Bull” Schweder, Penn guard,
Bolkovac said, "He wasn't too
good, just a drifter.”

Told that Schweder was last
'week’s “Lineman of the Week,”
Nick said, “Well he wasn't ‘Line-
man of the Week’ this week.”

Theirs F or Keeps

PRECIOUS OBJECT -- That football, which Bimbo ‘Cecconi, Equip-
ment Manager Bill Haynes, and Carl L)ePasqua (left to right) are clutch-
ing so tenaciously, .was a mighty elusive object on Saturday. The Pan-
thers were in hot water constantly because of their fumbles. Penn’s
Quakers always seemed to be on the recovering end. But in the last

analysis, Pitt owned the football,

as the above dressing room photo

will testify. Cecconi and DePasqua were the stars of the Panther running

attack.

By DAVE POLLOCK

PHILADELPHIA, Pa. -- Instead
of blocking Ray Dooney’s punt for
the winning safety against Penn on
Saturday, BernieiBarkouskie could
very easily have been warming the
bench at the time.

Shortly before Barkouskie turned
the tide he was very nearly ejected
from the ball game for arguing with
an official overia fumble.

Pitt fumbled on its own 18 and

in the end zone, where DiFonso
was tripped by Dave Coulson, Penn
quarterback. The resulting penalty

_put the ball on Penn’s one yard line.

Soupy Campbell plunged for the TD.
iBolkovac’s try for point-after-touch-
down was good.

Cecconi threw again to set up

”Pitt’s third touchdown. A 24 yard

pass to Earl Sumpter put the ball
on Penn’s six yard line. Fullback
Carl DePasqua ate up the remain-
ing yardage in three plays to score.

Pitt’s last and winning score

T - came in the last quarter with 35 sec-

onds of play remaining. Barkouskie
blocked Ray l)ooney’s punt in the
end zone for an automatic safety,
and the Panthers moved ahead of
the Quakers for the first ttirne since
early in the second quafter.

RED BAGNELL, Penn offensive
threat, was no stranger to Frosh
Coach Ted Schmitt. Schmitt coached
high school teams that played

5' against Bagnell when he was at

West Catholic and Friend School
in Philadelphia.

’iHero Barkouskie Almost
 Sat Out Crucial Play

Penn’s Herb Agocs being rewarded
the ball, the donnybrook began. 5

Bernie who claimed he had re-
covered the pigskin became so en-
raged he picked up the ball and
slammed it to the turf and began
arguing with one of the arbiters
before he was dragged away by
teammates and play resumed.

In explaining the blocked punt
later, Bernie said, “I just charged
through the line and threw my hands
over my face. I don’t even know
where the ball hit me. It felt like
it hit my arms and chest.”

The veteran guard was holding
a private "'Homecoming Day” at
Franklin Field, for he was showing
his home folks what he could do.
He hails from Kulpmont, an eastern
Pennsylvania town, and it was the
first time in his college ‘career that
he was performing in that area.

Barkouskie crashed furiously all
afternoon and capped off his big
day by blocking the punt for the
game-winning safety.

Dr. Jesse Quatse, Panther line
coach, called Barkouskie "the
best lineman on the field” with

Bill Gasparovic, starting his first"

game, running a close second.

In fact, nobody in the Panther
camp will be surprised if Barkouskie
gets the Associated Press "Line-
man of the Week” award. The Kulp-
mont veteran was quite a ball player
on Saturday. i

 

 

Harriers Edge

Penn,Too

Pitt’s harriers completed the sat-
urday conquestof Pennsylvania by
edging out the Quakers for second
place in a quadrangular meet at
Van Courtlandt Park, N. Y.

Penn was expected to finish sec-
ond behind the powerful Armysquad,
but the undenied harriers of coach
Carl Olson surprised the Quakers
and finished second.

Army Wins Easily

The Panthers were runner-up to
a heavily favored Army squad that
captured first place with 18 points.
Pitt had ()9 followed by Penn with
72 and Columbia with 101.

Ted Zatkovich paced the locals,
crossing the finishing line in tenth
spot. llis teammates followed in
order, giving Pitt tenth to sixteenth
places. Jay Neilson and Frank Kuz~
ma tied for eleventh with John MC.
Mahon, Ed Berman, lied \Xeigel, and
Ken lviahanna finishing in that order.

Shea First

Army’s fast-stepping Dick Shea
finished first, touring the 5-mile
course in 26:15. Zatkovich’s time
was 28:55.

Pitt is expented to enter its full
squad for the lC4A meet at New
York, Nov. 14, because of the Van
Courtlandt showing. This Saturday
the Panthers engage Case in adual
meet at Schenley Park. The meet
is scheduled for 11 a.m.

JV’s-Weak
On Scoring

Lack of scoring punch once
again proved costly to the Pitt
Jayvees in their loss to the un-
defeated Army Jayvees last Friday,
29-2. The Jayvees have tallied
only 14 points in their three games
played to date. .

The Panther Cubs got off to a
good start when early in the first
period a host of Pitt linemen smo-
thered Army punter Bill Ritter in
the end zone to register a safety.

The 2-0 lead wasn't safe enough
to stop the Black Knights. From
there on in the Generals were in-
vincible, scoring a touchdown in
each period plus a safety in the
second quarter.

If the Jayvees hope to finish the
season on Friday afternoon with a
five hundred average, they will
have to play their best ball of the
season. For the Ohio State Jayvees
will furnish strong opposition for
the Panthers.

Last year the Buckeyes laced
the Panther Cubs, 22-6, with
a shutout being averted in the last
two minutes of play.

With the IM football boys marching toward playoff lane, only
three teams can claim unblemished records. There is a represent-
ative of this select group in each of the three major IM circuits.
Stiff-arming all contenders Paul Turosak’s YMCA Eagle ag-

Cedars Billed Strong

The Cedars, a segment of last

the Civil Engineers, last season’s
Engineering League titlists, made
the independent League a potential
pre-season hotbed.

However, with allfeathers intact,
the Eagles can claim the 1949,111-
dependent League Crown and
playoff ticket.

Broke Record

Besides their undefeated and un-
tied record, the Psi 0's broke an
IM scoring record this season in a
71 —- 0 romp over the Pharmacy Jun-
iors.

Delta Sigma Delta, a rival dent
fraternity, and a darkhorse Medical
Junior sextet, may cause the Psi

guish in the Pro League playbffs,

,Sparked by Larry Brem;’s pre-
cision passing, Phi Delta Theta’s
Dragons own a 6-0 record to be
the only unmarred outfit in the al-
ways powerful fraternity league.

The Dragon’s chief roadblock in
their quest for a section I frater-
nity league title is the Phi Kappa
warriors who clutch a S — O-1 slate.

A darkhorse possibility in sec-

tion I is the everfeared PiKA force

who now card a 5-1-1 record.

Pi Lamda Phi with a S --0-l
slate is resting in firstplace in sec-
tion II. However the Pi Lam charges
must face two rough opponents in
the Delta Tau Delta and Delta Sig-
ma Phi forces.

lnspite of a Theta Chi upset vic-
tory, the Delts, holding a 5-1 re-
cord, are favored to cop the section
II laurels. Delta Sigma Phi’s Green-
wave upstarts are the season's most
improved six. Their 5—- I ——l record
makes them a threat for a fraternity
league playoff berth.

°Y’ Women
Attend UN

United Nations delegates are
friendly enough to talk to outside
of official sessions, a group of Pitt
YWCA girls admitted,‘ but during
session, they ‘advised, it’s best to
keep your distance. '

The girls were part of a large
delegation of Pitt YWCA members
who visited New York last week.
The part of the trip that impressed
the girls most was their visit to
UN headquarters.

Lois llager, president of the Pitt
YWCA, felt that the UN session was
a constant battle. Polish delegates
declared that the United States had
no right to interfere with the ques-
tion of whether or not Bulgaria and

Rumania should be allowed to enter '

the UN. "We saw,” said Mary Park-
er, a member of the Pitt group, "that
members of the UN are real people
too.” , I

The girls were supplied with radio
microphones which could be tuned
to any of five different languages.
"It made us feel a lot closer to

many of those countries,” said an-
of the Pitt girls. "It really was a
wonderful experience,” another
added.

The girls also visited Columbia
University, the Empire State Build-
ing, Rockefeller Center, the Statue
of Liberty, and Greenwich Village.

Engineers ‘TV Trot ’

Slated November 11 a

The Engineering and Mines Association has christened this
year’s dance the "TV Trot” and scheduled Ben Benack and his

"Collegians” for the affair.

An annual event, the E&M dance will be in We stview Park's
Danceland from 9 p.m. until l.a.m. on Nov. 11.

Grid Finale
Dance Set

Both Pitt and Penn State close
out their football seasons when they
meet at Pitt Stadium on Nov. 19.
This cessation of hostilities will
be carried over to the "Grand
Finale,” a dance for Penn State
as. well as Pitt students in the
Schenley Hotel starting at 8:30 p.m.
that evening.

Marie Homisak was namedchair-
man of the dance by the Student
Congress Appointments Committee.
Assisting her are Earl Jacobs, bus-
iness manager,.and Bill Moltz, pub-
licity chairman.

According to Chairman Marie
Homisak the "Grand Finale” will
symbolize the spirit of this last
big game of the season as far as
football is concerned and will in
addition, give the rival students a
chance to meet each other in more
amicable surroundings.

Brad llunt’s orchestra will be on
the bandstand to supply three and
a half hours of music. Dance com-
mittee members have not yet de-
cided on entertainment for the in-
termission.

in the refreshment line will be the
of ten cent cokes.
Both ballrooms of the Schenley will
be opened for dancing and promise
plenty of room for an overflow crowd.

Tickets have been priced at $2.50
with the usual penalty of an in-
crease in price if bought at the
door being absent.

Coed Group Gets

Four members of the Women’s
Speech Association will take to the
airwaves Friday, Nov. 4 at 2:45
p.m. over station WPGH.

Judy Sinclair, Babette Lenzner,
Doris Lyda, and Dolores Bernstein
willdiscuss ‘A Scientific Approach
to Courtship.’ The discussion will
be led by William S. Tacey, of the
speech department. .

Future programs slated for dis-
cussion by members of the asso-
ciation include 'School Spirit’ and
'Vocational Guidance in Colleges.’.

IF Council Sponcers
Frat House Dances

A ‘Progressive Dance’ sponsored
by IF Council will be held at the
various social fraternity houses on
Saturday ni,ghtNov. 12, according
to Howard Hirsch of Sigma Alpha

Mu fraternity, publicity manager for 

the affair.

Each house will have a dance
that evening and the idea ofthe
affair is to have each member of
the various fraternities visit fra-
ternity houses other than his own.

The name of the dance, TV Trot,
springs from the door prize, a table
model TV set with a built in aerial.
This year the winner's date will not
be forgotten when the prizes are
awarded. She will be presented‘ with
a smaller gift which has not yet
been announced by Dance. Chair-
man Larry Eisenhauer.

E&M is attempting a new "con-
centrated” membership drive this
year. Memberships, at $2.50, may
be obtained on the ground floor of
State Hall on Nov. 3, 4, and 7.
-The dance is free to all members.
In addition to the TV Trot member-

ship includes an invitation to a

smoker later in the semester.

E&M studentsican also purchase
membership cards at the Student
Desk of from any E&M cabinet mem-

One minor but startling innovation-

Friday Radio Spot

Chest l)riv~e

(Cont. from Page 1).,

The great strikes in and about
the city have temporarily halted the
income of many employed students

and the families of many others.
A ruling of faculty members of the
Pitt Chest Council forces the stu-
dent committee to conduct one drive
only instead of the two separate
drives held in the Spring and Fall
ofprevious years.

The 1949 Spring Drive was the
best in the history of the campaign
in the amount of money subscribed.
A total of $3,299 was taken in sur-
passing the expected goal by $300.
