posed amendments

V today’s referendum.

At the farcical-little Student Government meeting
held Monday afternoon,..C-aro__ll "‘.G1__issie” Smith, Vic?‘ ‘
president of SG, stood up and’ had the’ audacity. to de- .
clare before a reporter from this newspaper that the .
fourth amendment to the SG constitution was not
designed speciﬁcally so thatione person presently not

' eligibleiwould be permitted to’ run for the ofﬁce of

Miss Smith claimed, asldid Marty Landy, presi-
dent of SG, that the amendment has been needed for_ _a
long time and that this was the only. reason for its
inclusion in today’s referendum. This 1S pure swill.

If this amendment was such an important piece
' of legislation ‘as both Miss Smith and Landy claim,
then why havetheyiwaited so long to propose it? Why
did they bring it up just before the election and‘_not
sooner? Why do. they refuse to consider any Suggestions
that this amendment not go into effect until nextcyear?
Why did three senators walkout of the .SG meeting on
Monday to stop a vote on a motion which ‘would have
put’ back the referendum until after elections? _
A The amendment was brought up at this time be-
cause of one person’s ineligibility to run in this one
election, and all motions which would have made his
running impossible were shelved. . V
,j_' ‘ This is just plain dirty .politics_an_d should be _ab- .
Jaorred by all students at this University. The amend-
ing by SG of an entire‘ constitution just to make one
person eligible for an_ election is about as low as any
group on this campus has yet stooped. , .
In a hastily prepared. “explanation” of the pro-
which has
throughout the campus, it is claimed that this amend-
ment will make those students who come to the Oak-
land campus from the regional institutions eligible to
-.__run' for SG, and that they were not eligible before.
_’ ,This'is a complete lie concocted by the authors of
‘ thepamphletlto hide their own shoddy motivations.
Students from’ the regional campuses have always’
been eligible for SG because the regionals are consid-
ered part of the University and this is the only stipu-
lation outlined in the present SG constitution.
The entire basis-for this amendment has a o_dor ‘
to it which should repel all intelligent, students. lt is a
move by the framers of the amendments to retain the
power of government in their own hands and in those
of their appointed successors. .
Why shouldthe student body at this institution put
up with such tactics? The answer is that they don’t
have to, they can vote “No” to theamendments in

entertain any other business."

, V _ Defends Amendments
The SG president spoke brieﬂy in defense of the four proposed
amendments to the constitution. He lashed out at critics of proposed
amendment one, noting that bylaws, such as one calling for three
preliminary meetings, discussions and votes “will prevent anything
from being railroaded through the Senate at the expense of the
. student body.-"’ . - _ '
Amendment three, which will chisel Senate membership to
twenty it passed, was applauded by Landy, who favors informal
T meetings with group leaders pared from the Senate by such an
amendment. ‘» T ‘ '

Landy passed lightly over amendments two and -four, noting in
the latter case that “I in no way favor one person in the race.”
“Weak Senate” .
Carroll (Gussie) Smith urged the senators to quit quibb_ling,_cit-
- ing merit in amendments three and four. “The reason we’ve_had a
weak Senate this year,” said Miss Smith, “is because, as you can see,
people ‘aren’t here.” There were 15 members present for the session.
Privilege was granted to Joe Seiger, who stated that it was
not the Senate that was weak, but the leaders. “Pin afraid of
what's going to happen before the election is over,” said Seiger.

“I’m fed up with all the lying, shame and hatred that’s going
on here.” . '

Susan Druckemiller voiced opposition to the way in which the
amendments had been approved by SG. “I don’t think that two hours
isssuﬁicient time to make a decision to accept either theamendments
or a University Council proposal,” she said.

— Motion Defeated .

A recommendation by Cardin to discuss a tabled motion, intro-
duced by Miss Druckemiller at a previous meeting, followed resolve-
ment of -the Committee of the Whole. That motion, requiring that a
proposed amendment be read at three consecutive meetings before it
is discussed, was defeated, 6 to 5.

By Stan Stein

The University will very seldom go in to something knowing that it will be a money-

losing proposition, so the question now is “Will there be another Winter'Weekend?”

Members of Student Union Board have assured me more than once that there will

‘be another Weekend next year, despite the ﬁnancial pounding the project took this year.
' But is it really worth it?
I attended Winter Weekend, and for me it was worth it, well worth
it. I couldn’t have found that kind of entertainment and fun for that kind

”News’ ” Taste

Questioned
By Soph U

Editor, The Pitt News: .
First of all, The Pitt
News acted in questionable
taste when it accepted a
letter signed with a pseu-
donym — Gene Davenport.
As for the letter itself, I
don’t wish to refute Mr.

Davenport (S o f a B e d?)- ‘

point by point. I wish to
say only that I was amused.
Those students who feel
that ﬁghting - for Negro
rights is the constitu-
tional moral duty of every
American and who cheer
each advance in this ﬁght,

. must on occasion laugh as

I do at the hysterical panic
of the Davenports.

Theirs must have been.

the attitude of the citizens
of Jericho as they felt the
rumblings and shakings of
the walls of their - city.
I for one will feel no pity
when the walls come tum-
bling down around them.

lEIl|ER . . .‘ ~

Negro. ‘Do.m,inance_'.i
Refuted by Seniorsﬁ

Editor, The Pitt News:
Whoever thinks that the

Negro has dominance over

the White man is “off his

rocker.” The person who
wrote the (letter to the edi-
tor appearing in the Feb.
14’ issue of The Pitt News)’

either can’t write or hopes_

that people can’t read. It is

faulty to assume. that the

Negro has “neither the re-
sponsibility nor the compe-
tence for a new way of
life.” In this regard Mr.
Davenport, “I can do any-

‘ thing you can do — better.”

It is at least stupid on your
part to try writing on a
subject that is completely
“over your head’ (multiple

‘m e a n in g) —- apparently

you are not Negro.

‘With respect to compe-
tence ' and responsibility,
the article you wrote dem-
onstrates _
both: It is strictly a per-
sonal affair, which is ‘not to
be construed to apply ra-
cially. —

To—assume that the white
Americans have become
“so fearful’ is unfair to peo-
ple of the country at large.
If you are afraid of the
“painted devil,” speak for
yourself.» Many of" my
white associates are -not
fearful’ because they are
thinking individuals whose
abilities and cultures make
“fear” unnecessary.

At the root of your ap-

‘proach is ‘the belief that

you .know how to deter-
mine‘ “competence and re-
sponsibility” -—_ you don’t.
Your criteria for trying to
qualify people for decent
treatment are , just like
most —— all wrong. If an in-
dividual is breathing, then
that individual qualiﬁes —-
the other qualiﬁcations are
simply defense mechan-
isms. ‘

One could argue that
you, Mr. Davenport, don’t
qualify as awriter, for you
contradict ' yourself. You
state explicitlythat “by the

V__I1eXt-,_,day ‘one ._o_:_t the men. _

your ‘need for-

  

had been ﬁred as totally in-
competent”; yet, in the
very next paragraph you
say it is a -fact _“that these
particular people cannot

either be ﬁred or made to .

work.” The two statements
don’t support one another.

More signiﬁcant islyour
implication that Negroes
tend to let their neighbor-

hoods run down. Hopeful-_

ly, you might be enlight-'

ened to know that the slum
dwellings in which I grew
up were owned by white
landlords. You probably
dislike learning of this, but

these same landlords sim-

ply refused to keep these
houses in a proper state of
repair.

Realistically, I’ll simply

_say that the Negro in this

regard has been, and still is,
exploited by greedy white
landlords. When it rains
these dwellings leak and, of
course, the plaster__ falls -
when it’s cold, the water
pipes freeze —- not to men-
tion that the wind whistles

through, making, heating‘

difficult." ,
This is the general pic-

ture. The point is that these '

discrepancies are permitted
to exist because it’s proﬁt-
able to these same white
landlords who own whole
blocks of houses. The ex-
orbitant rent precludes any
real attempts at repair by
the tenants, and getting a
car ﬁnanced becomes easier
than getting a bank to loan
money to‘ repair a rented
house.

. The tragedy of the‘ whole‘

affair is that thechildren of
these white landlords get
to go to college, and learn
how to write articles in the
school newspaper about
the people whom their
parents have exploited ﬁ.-
nancially. I suggest that
you would do better to
write about lung cancer_
and smoking.

‘l-Bob Smizi:
Lehigh Remembers
Upset In 1961

Saturday’s wrestling match between the Panthers
and Lehigh has attracted wide scale interest ‘among
wrestling fans in this area basically because of the two
competing teams. The Pitt-Lehigh rivalry has develop-
ed into the biggest in the East in recent years mainly
because both are the most consistent powers in the East.

The interest in Saturday’s meet is mainly due to

‘ this rivalry, because both teams
i have their weakest squads in re-
cent years. Thefact that the entire
East is weak this year makes this
match important, however, be-
cause despite the caliber of the
two‘ teams, they still rank among
the best in the East.
The rivalry between the two
schools began to reach its height
in 1961. That year a heavily favor-

 

 

Panthers at Bethlehem, 16-14.‘

BOB SMIZIK People who saw the match
will not soon forget it. Not only was it adorned by per-
haps the greatest collection of wrestlers ever to appear
in an Eastern dual meet, but it also saw some of the
weirdest and most successful strategy ever used in a
collegiate match. ’

The factlthat _the 18 wrestlers appearing in that
meet went on to win a total of 17 Eastern and three
National titles speaks for the caliber of wrestlers in the
match. Even further proof of this is the fact that a
future National champion and a future two-time Eastern
champion were beaten, the latter by a fall.

Panthers Had Top Lightweights

t Pitt had probably the greatest corps—of lightweight
Wrestlers in the country and scored heavily in the early
bouts. Panther 123-pounder Rich Martin, an Eastern

champion, pinned future two-time Eastern titlist Pat"

Smartt. Future two-time Eastern. and National champion
Larry Lauchle won fortthe Panthers at 130-pounds as
did Eastern champ John Zolikoif at 147-pounds. Future

Eastern champ Daryl Kelvington of Pitt and Curt.

Alexander battled to a tie at 137-pounds. Pitt took a

‘13-2 lead into the 157-pound match.

" Now began the strategy which Lehigh fans call a
disgrace to wrestling, but which Panther fans call
brilliant. 1 ~ .

Lehigh’s wrestlers in the‘157, 167 and 177-pound di-
visions were unbeaten and were to go on to win seven
Eastern titles. Coach Rex Peery’s representatives in these
weights had won only one match all season.

A win by any Pitt man would have been the biggest up-
set since David took Goliath. But the Panthers didn’t need

' ' awin, they needed to avoid a fall and Lehigh’s threesome

were pin-experts.
Peery never tells a wrestlers to avoid a pin. He be-

- A lieves it destroys their conﬁdence. Fortunately, the Pan-

 

 satisfy any wrestling. fan.

thers, three wrestlers, Augie Arrigone, Bill Robb and Paul
Wilson, were realists. They knew they had ‘no chance to
win. ' ’ - I

Managed to Avoid a Pin

For 27 minutes Lehigh fans showered boos on the
Panther ‘wrestlers, but it meant nothing to Arrigone,
Robb and Wilson as they crawled, stalled and ran to avoid
the pin. And they were all successful, although Robb
almost defaulted due to an excessive number of stalling
points called against him.

Lehigh trailed by only one as Jim Harrison met
Dave Angell in the 191-pound match. Peery moved Har-
rison up from 167-pounds because he felt he had a better
chance to win against Angell. Harrison led for two
periods, but Angell’s extra weight proved the difference
and the Lehigh grappler, a future Eastern champion,

scored heavily in the ﬁnal period and won, 9-5. Harrison .

went on to win an Eastern and National title two years
later. '

Panther footballer Bob Guzik met another future
Eastern champ, Chuck Moore, in the decisive heavy-
weight match. Lehigh now led, 14-13. After two periods
Moore, led, 1-0, on an escape. However, inthe third period
Guzik escaped almost at the buzzer and later scored a
"take-down. Moore escaped late in the period, but Guzik
had enough riding time to pick up a point and win, 4-2.

_ Lehigh had its ﬁrst loss of the season and Pitt had its
biggest upset in its short wrestling history.

This Saturday’s match won’t live up to the 1961 meet,

but just so long as it’s Pitt vs. Lehigh that’s_ enough to

Day-Off Means

Hard Workoltt
For Wrestlers

Although the schedule call-
ed last Saturday an off-day for
the Panther wrestlers, -many
of the teamimembers wrestled

their toughest ‘matches of the ‘
season in an intra-squad dual _

meet at Fitzgerald Field.House.

'Assistant coach Jim Harrison
prepped the team for Saturday’s
meet with Lehigh as coach Rex
Peery was off scouting Penn State.
Peery wasr_1’t forgetting about Le-
high; former assistant coach Dave
Johnson was scouting the ‘En-
gineers. ._

Mike Johnson’s team soundly
beat Lee Hall’s team in the in-
tra-squad matches, with Frank

.0’Korn and Tom Heniff scor-
ing important personal ‘wins for

Johnson. , -

O’Korn decisioned. Don Caslow,
6-1, and thusinsured his spot in
the lineup for the Lehigh match.
The day before Caslow had beaten
O’Korn and if Caslow had won
Saturday he would have been
wrestling against Lehigh. But
O’Korn scored all six of his points
in thirty seconds of the second
period, with an escape, take down
and near fall, to insure his posi-
tion. ‘

Heniff decisioned Duff "Killian,
3-1, totake the ﬁrst step towards
winning back the 123-pound spot
which he held last season. The
two will meet later in the week
to determine who starts against

Lehigh. Under Peery’s system a

challengermust beat the incum-
bent twice to win a starting spot.
If Heniff succeeds in winning
back his position he will have
done just what Killian did last
year. Last season Heniﬁ‘ wres-
tled in eight of the nine dual
meets, missing one due to in-
jury, but was beaten out by
Killian for the Eastern cham-
pionships. Now it is Killian
who faces the prospect of los-
ing his season-long starting job.

In other matches Johnson de-
cisioned freshman Terry Sulli-
van, 9-1; Dino Boni decisioned
frosh. Al Traunsteiner, 10-0, in
the only win for Hall’s team; Tom
Baily shut out freshman George
Huson, 5-0; Hall and Ken Barr
tied in an overtime match, with
Barr having a ten pound weight
advantage; and Bill Beck deci-
sioned Bill Bodle, 2-0.

The Panthers will be after their
ﬁrst win in three years when they-
meet Lehigh Saturday at 8 p.m.
at the Field House.

Frosh Hoopstc1's
In Action Tonight

The freshman basketball team,
which scored its ninth win of the
season last Saturday by beating
Washington & Jefferson, goes af-
ter win number ten tonight at
Fitzgerald Field House when they
take on the Youngstown junior
varsity at 6:30 p.m. .

The Panther juniorvarsity was
scheduled to play W & J, but
at the last minute it was decided
to send the frosh. ‘

Both the freshmen and the jun-
ior varsity are nearing the end
of their seasons. After tonight’s
game the freshmen meet Du-

Tonight’s Clash Pits
Participants Of Both

Maj or Tournaments

Tonight’s contest at Fitzgerald Field House between
the Panthers and Temple features an NCAA team against
an NIT participant. After Saturday’s 63-57 Win over La-
Salle, the Owls automatically qualiﬁed for the NCAA
as the winner of the Mid-Atlantic Conference, with an 15-5 record.

On Monday morning ‘athletic director Frank Carver received
a call from Johnny Bach, head of the NIT selection committee.
Carverwas on another long distance call and so Bach spoke to
' Panthercoach Bob Timmons. Bach in-
formed, Timmons that Pitt was invited
to the NIT. Timmons accepted. _

As soon as he finished the long‘ dis-
tance call, Carver called Asa Bushnell,
Secretary of the Metropolitan Inter-
collegiate Basketball Association, spon-

officially accepted a bid to the Nrr.
Bushnell also informed Carver
that New York University and De-
Paul had been invited to the NIT
and both had accepted. Carver
JOHNNY BACH said, “Because we were one of the
firstiteams chosen, there is a chance that we might be seeded
among the top four teams.

“We are happy to take the NIT bid. The players areiglad
and I’m sure they’ll do well in New York. I didn’t receive any
feelers at all fromi the NCAA and so I accepted the NIT bid
as soon as I received it." ' .

Timmons said, “The team is interested in going to the NIT.
We set out" at the beginning of this year to make "a tournament,
and we’ve accomplished it. Now that we are in a tournament
we’re half-way to our goal —— to win it.” .

are only 3-6 on the road- . _

The Panther track team will have

to be at its best if they are to defeat
, Notre Dame at South Bend Saturday.
_ The Irish have a balanced team
and are strong in the dashes, middle

and long distance runs, and the pole .

vault. The shot put is the only event in
which they show a weakness.

In the 60-yard dash the Irish have a
ﬁne runner in Johnny Martin, and since
the Panthers’ star sprinter Bill DelVec-
chio is injured, Martin will probably have

' an easy win.

The 60-yard, hurdles will feature a
personal duel between the Panthers’
Joe Friend and Notre I)ame’s Pete
Whitehouse. In their previous two meet-

. ings they have one victory apiece.
In the quarter and half—mile the Pan-

' _thers’ chances are also slight. Notre Dame’s

The Panthers will also face stiff com-

ur

Frank Carver has a 9:11 time in the two

John Bailey will run the mile and two

’mile, respectively. Bailey’s best time in

the mile is 4:2l.8.'

The Panthers’ Mort Stanﬁeld will
have trouble in the high jump from
Whitehouse who has iumped ‘6-feet-5,
and Dave McNamee in the pole vault
who has cleared 14-feet-3. Stanﬁeld will
have to improve on his Kent State marks
of 6-feet inthe high jump and 12—feet
in the pole vault if_ he is _to win.

The shot put and the broad jump are.
the weak spots on the Notre Dame team.
Al Thommassy will toss the shbt for the 7
Panthers, while Luddy Hayden will broad
jump for the Panthers. .

‘Coach Carl Rees says, “The loss of Del-
Vecchio has hurt us in the dashes, but
if Bailey keeps improving in the two mile
he could give Carver a good race. We only

y

have a chance if everyone does his best.”

The Seniors moved into a ﬁrst place tie

Lack of Glory  
Fails to Deter
Gymnast Team

“Very few sports offer as
much opportunity for person-
al satisfaction as does gym-
nastics.” ’So_ spoke Warren
Neiger, who has coached that

snort here for ten years._

.Neiger went
on to explain.
“In a sport like
football, prac-
tice can often
be drudgery.
For those kids
the game is the
b i g ‘p a y o f f.
Gymnastics is
different. Each
5 day a boy gets
Warren Nexger the opportunity
to learn some new skill or to add
to his routine. It’s seldom" the
yell of the crowds that elates him,
rather it’s a sense of real indi-
vidual accomplishment.”

Neiger singled out a couple of
competitors on his present squad
who became interested in the
sport just because’ of its intrinsic
rewards. “Neither Ed Stim nor
Bill Shenefelt had any high school
experience,” he stated. “Both are
real good workers, though They-ve
become devoted to gymnastics, and
by sticking with it they’ve come
a ‘long way.”

As far as coaching the spor‘; is

    

~ concerned Neiger had this to say:

 

“The difficulty here is knowing
how far to push. If you ask a
boy to go all out at the wrong
flime he’s in danger of suffering a
serious fall. A gymnastics coach
has to know how much to demand
from each kid and when to ask
it.--By. FRED BERLIN. I A

Planning Office Sets
New Withdrawal Plan

The Ofﬁce of Planning and Policy Coordination has an-
nounced a revised undergraduate student resignation proce-

. dure. Staff Associate Dr. Leslie W. Ross, in announcing the

new policy, emphasized thatthe. new setup is for students
who withdraw from a total program of the University and
not from one or more courses which do not constitute the

trimester’s total credit load.

He said: “We feel we’ve great-
ly simpliﬁed the withdrawal
system. In the past students had
to go to “x_” number of offices in
a complicated procedure. For this
reason many students didn’t even
bother to notify the University
when they resigned but just left.
Now the system is simpliﬁed to

ya two—stop procedure for liberal

arts students and a one-step op-
eration for all other.”

Under the newly-adopted pro-
cess liberal arts students must
report ﬁrst to the Office of the
Dean of Liberal_Arts (917 CL).

All other students must report
directly to the Office of the Dean
of Men (505 Schenly Hall) or
Dean of Women (1209 CL) for
an interview and completion of
a resignation form. ,

Students who complete the pre-
scribed resignation p r 0 c e d u r e
shall in most cases be granted an
official resignation. Those who
merely stop attending c I a s s e 5
without notifying the proper
authorities shall be granted an un-
official resignation. In such in-
stances failing marks will be re-
corded and charged against them,
and they will not be entitled to
a refund of the $50 matriculation
deposit if such deposit was made.

In addition to completing either.

the one or two—stop procedure,

ﬂresigning students must:

Return all library books and
pay all ﬁnes due.
Return all keys, equipment and

' uniforms.

Settle all ﬁnancial obligations
with the University.

9

If living in residence halls, re-
port to the head resident.

These steps are to be completed
before the student leaves the Uni-
versity. Transcripts will be with-
held for non-compliance.

The resignation procedure shall
be required of all full—time and
part-time undergraduate students
in the schools of Liberal Arts,
Engineering and Mines, Educa-
tion, Pharmacy, Nursing, and the
four regional campuses.

It shall not be required of grad-
uate students enrolled in any
school of theUniversity, students
in the School of General Studies,
students in professional schools
other than those listed above, and
students who are obtaining a
baccalaureate degree and who
have been certiﬁed by their aca-
demic dean for graduation.

session “the worst display of

He stalked out of the chamber,
