Rutherford not charged

JOE MARCHILENA
‘Sports Editor

Charges stemming from an‘

altercation outside of a Station
Square club early Monday
morning have'no't been filed
against Rod Rutherford.

A 19-year-old woman filed
a criminal complaint against
the Pitt starting quarterback,
claiming that he assaulted her
and shattered her car window
in a parking lot behind" Philthy
McNasty’s, a bar near Station
Square, around 2:30 a.m.
Monday morning.

According to the complaint,
the woman said she and two
friends were in a car with
Rutherford when he began to
make advances toward her.

A’

She said he became angry -

when she rejected his
advances, causing him to get
out of the car.

Rutherford then grabbed
the woman’s arm, trying to pull

her out of the vehicle, and
kicked in one of the car’s win-
dows, according to the com-
plaint. " '

Rutherford
met with police
and gave a,sta’te,—

South Side prac-
tice facility on
M‘ o n d a y .
Rutherford _ said
the .woman pro-
voked him by
throwing -a glass

at him in the
parking lot,
according to a

source close to
the situation.

“He certainly
wants to tell his
side of the story,” police Lt.
Mark Romutis «told the Tribune-
Review on Monday. “He claims
he has some witnesses. We’ll
take all statements and discuss
it with the district attorney and

 

determine whether criminal
charges are warranted, just like
any other case.”

No charges had been filed
as of Tuesday
night.

Rutherford’s
status remains in
question for
Saturday’s sea-
son—opening home

State.

When studentsilook at the Cathedral of ’

Learning, many think, “class.”

Administrators might look at the Cathedral
and think, “work.” V L .

To others, though, nothing compares to the
artistry that is enshrined in the -Nationality
Rooms at Pitt. ‘ t

For those who are able to identify with a
Nationality Room, the building stands as a

proud reminder of the ethnic and national roots‘

of Pittsburgh families.

To receive a Nationality. Room ‘in the
Cathedral, an ethnic group with a history in
Western Pennsylvania can form a committee and
apply for the school’s approval‘.

The group also must raise the necessary

‘funds to build the room.

. The price tag for a room- usually
ranges from $150,000 to $250,000.
The time from the beginning of
fund—raising to completion of the
room also varies — the Indian Room

took about five years to complete,

while the Israel
Heritage Classroom
took 20 years.

The nationality to
most recently receive
the school’s approval
follows the leadership
of Seija Cohen, chair
of the Finnish Room
Committee.

The group may
have captured the last
nationality room up
for grabs, at least on
the third floor.

“This will com-
plete this generation,”
E. Maxine Bruhns

said. Bruhns, the director of the

Nationality .\ Rooms and
Intercultural Exchange Programs,
said that, with the additional plan-
ning of Danish, Swiss, Philippine,
Turkish, Latin American, and Welsh
Rooms, there will be no more
Nationality Rooms available on the
first or third floors of the Cathedral.

Does this slam the door on any
future rooms?

 

“Well, the secondyﬂoor has no
elevators,” Bruhns said.

Elevator access is necessary, in‘

order that Nationality rooms be
available for disabled and elderly
visitors.

Bruhns feels that a new genera-
tion of rooms might be established

by immigrant groups whose num-_

bers have increased
inrecent years. If
new groups decide
to apply, they might
establish 1 more
-Nationality Rooms
on the basement
floor, she said.
Cohen said
the desire to have a
room is simply
I explained.
“Finland sur-
vived,” Cohen said.
The Finnish
committee, ' which
consists of between
, 30 and 40 people,
will.be proud that, among countries
once threatened or conquered by
the U.S.S.R., Finland will be repre-
sented on. the third floor of the
Cathedral. ‘ K
In‘ September, the Finnish
Minister .of "Finance, Antti
Kalliomaki, will come to Pittsburgh
for a tea, by which means the com-
mittee hopes to raise funds for the
room.

EDITORIAL

College students are a powerful Voting bloc

Senator John Kerry, D-

, Massachusetts, announced his candi-

dacy for the Democratic nomination
for president yesterday.

Concurrently, the Associated Press
reported a poll that found only 5 per-
cent of registered voters recognized
Kerry’s name. When polled about
other Democratic candidates, 10 per-
cent of the voters could identify
Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, while 11
percent recognized Missouri Rep.
Richard Gephardt and 14 percent had
heard of Connecticut Sen. Joseph
Lieberman.

Dean, unlike Gephardt and
Lieberman, had virtually no name
recognition before the nomination race
began. Now he exceeds Kerry, who
was considered the favorite, and his
success is mostly due to Dean’s cam-
paign strategy, which targets the
youngest voter demographic — 18- to
25-year-olds.

This strategy is clearly working,
because Dean now enjoys twice the
recognition Kerry does, and recogni-
tion leads to votes.

But if college students are such a
lucrative market, why aren’t more can-
didates pitching to us? And further-
more, why aren’t more students find-
ing out about candidates?

As one of the major population and
voting demographics, we can expect to
be wined and dined by other candi-

dates, and not just Democratic ones.
Now that Dean has shown the force of
marketing to us, others will follow.

Therefore, as voters — and if
you’re not registered, it’s time to get
on the big, red party wagon — we have
a responsibility to be informed about
candidates and the issues they espouse.

This especially applies if a single
issue is your litmus test for candidates.
For instance, if you can’t imagine vot-
ing for someone with a pro-life or pro-
gun control platform, ’don’t.

But that doesn’t preclude learning
about each candidate’s complete agen-
da, because several candidates might
support what you do. Highlight each
candidate’s platform using a series of
bullet—points, if you must. 4

It’s time that we, as college stu-
dents, started doing our political
homework. This race looks to be a hot
one. The decisions we make now set
the course, not only for one presiden-
tial term, but also in other arenas. The
next president will probably appoint
several Supreme Court judges. What
we choose will echo in history. This is
not a choice to be taken lightly. The
drama surrounding the primaries
should be seen as a call to action.
Learn what people have to say, decide
based on issues — not just superﬁcial-
ities — and prove that we, as a voting
bloc and a generation, have something
to say.

Duckies: one of high seas’ many terrors

Sunken treasure, it appears, is now
passe, replaced by the much more conve-
nient ﬂoating treasure. Thirty thousand Nike
running shoes —- which run a ﬁstful of dou-
bloons per pair — have been loosed upon
the high seas, and theyare accompanied by
29,000 bath toysfnom a separate shipment
— including rubber duckies —-manufac-
tured under First Years Inc.

According to an Aug. 31 article in The
Washington Post, First Years offered a $100

U.S. savings bond for every »~

ducky found around Iceland or
on the American or Canadian
Atlantic coast

Not just any ducky will do,
though. The ducky must be a
conﬁrmed member of the
washed-overboard cargo of a

  

  

creating danger for unsuspecting boaters.
Beyond that, even when the duckies
perish, their non-biodegradable, plastic
corpses further pollute our oceans. I remem-
ber the ﬁrst time I heard uproar about plastic
six-pack rings killing dolphins. The rings
seem downright harmless next to a Nike.
And the ducks are only a small part of
the 10,000 cargo containers that fall off ships
each year, a situation that has earned the ire
of environmentalists, according to the Post
article. Itcomes as no surprise,
then,thatthereisabountyon
the heads of these so—called
* “children’s toys.”
Yet perhaps the duckies,

are, get a bad rap. After all,
they were washed overboard

1992 ship en route from China V. by a severe Paciﬁc storm,
to Seattle. Marty Flaheﬁy whereas the rings were trans-

T‘hat’s right: the reward is C°"”ib“ti“g Edi”? , ported to sea quite intentional-
for ducldes that have migrated ‘ ly, with other trash, in huge

from Paciﬁc to Atlantic. Moreover, accord-
ing to oceanographers Curtis. Ebbesmeyer
and James Ingraham, the duckies probably
took the route least traveled

“Wind moves ice frcrn the Bering Strait
[between Russia and Alaska], over the North
Pole, and down to eastern Greenland at
about a mile a day,” Ebbesmeyer said ‘Ice
and, apparently, bath toys.

. The duckies are only 94 years behind
humans — Robert Peary’s 1909 expedition
was the ﬁrst recorded trip to the North Pole
— and are substantially hardier than us, hav-

I ing made the voyage while frozen in ﬂoes of

ice. If plastic ducks are capable of such a
feat, what might our prized computers, so
villainized by ﬁlms like “The Terminator”
and ‘The Matrix,” prove capable of?

My computer, I can safely say, is capa-
ble of being hit with a tire iron by me. But
rubber duckies, I can attest, are far more
resilient in the face of bludgeoning.

Moreover, the toys, like other products
washed to sea, tend to come in steel shipping
containers. The containers often stay aﬂoat,

garbage barges.‘Rage about the shoes, if you
must. Make the shipping companies clean
up their steel containers. But let the rubber
duckies — and their frog, t11rtle and beaver
ﬁiends, brought to you by the same compa-
ny — swim free. '

So ﬁnd a weekend and make a trip to
the beach. New England is probably the best
ducky-hunting spot in the States. You might
ﬁnd a ducky, thus making up the cost of your
trip and helping to save humankind for our
children. I will be staying right here. My
complexion’ means a day in the sun leaves
me burnt, if not molten. Moreover, I fear the
tenors of the sea, such as the Portuguese
man-of-war, which is a small: ﬂoating airbag
with long, cuddly, death tentacles.

I learned from Ebbesmeyer and V

Ingraham that there are onions, to which I
am ﬁercely allergic, ﬂoating unchecked
throughout the sea.

The horror. The honor.

An experience south, of the Equator

Waking up and thinking. it was summer, I turned to
the windowsill and saw the snow—covered Andes,
which sent a chill crawling up my spine. I rolled out of
the bed topped with four wool blankets, walked to my
door, and opened it to my 5 8-year-old host mother who
said, with bright eyes, “Buenos dias, Ashley!” I smiled
and answered, “Si!” O

The ﬁrst few weeks, I still woke up in shock. I had
been accepted into a program to travel to Chile through

the Center of Latin American Studies with a group of
14 undergraduate students, one graduate student and a
professor. I was conducting independent research" on
Augusto Pinochet and his dictatorship’s inﬂuence on
visual arts. I still was confused as to where “las micros”

(the buses) stopped and how to ask for food to go.
“Para llevar...para llevar....,” I said, as the lady
behind the counter at the bakery smiled with sympathy
and put my fresh roll in a paper bag. It was the accent.
I ’ The Andes lined the

window sill, tips of moun-
tains peaking . into my
blurry, morning view. The
Paciﬁc Ocean was a 15-
minute walk from my
front door in Vina del Mar.
“Within weeks, the Spanish
language wasn’t just a
bunch of words, but a
form of expression and
living. ’ _

‘From Chile, I ven-
tured with ﬁve other
“companeras” to Buenos
Aires, the land‘ of the best
beef, the friendliest taxi

orful ‘streets, where

drivers and the most col-.

vibrant tango dancers twirled in unison. The state of the
economy was supposed to, frighten us away, yet we
ventured on, continuing to roll our R’s and eat dinner at
1 a.m., as the Argentinians did. ‘ .

Dancers in Buenos Aires hold each other close.
“Me llamo Ashley” sounds like “Me jamo Asjjley.” I
could walk around the town and, by paying ten dollars
for a leather skirt, make a merchant’s day. It was one of
the most beautiful and friendly cities I had ever visited.

From Argentina, I went north “sola.” Three hours
from Monterey, Ca., I planted my feet in Torreon,
Mexico, the land of the watchtower. In the city with an
approximate population of one million people, the cor-
ners were covered with Baskin-Robbins and Pizza Hut
chains. There were more North American investments
than I had seen all summer long. I spoke with Mexicans
and found them to be friendly and warm, yet they spoke
English, too. I was getting an'gry.iHow come ever-yon
was speaking English? ‘

. Many stated that their relatives now reside in
Texas, Chicago and even Canada. The borders are all
blendingtogether, and, soon, it won’t feel so foreign to
go or to come back. And hearing Spanish won’t make
me tum_ my head, but hearing mariachi music or danc-
ing the tango will transport me back to those summer
days. I ’

Oh, those summer days.

what’s new in popular music. That time,
unfortunately, is gone, but there are still
great music videos being made. This is
evident in. the DVD collection of
Radiohead videos titled “7 Television
Commercials.” ' '

Music videos can be viewed as televi-
sion commercials for albums. The seven
television commercials included on this
DVD are. singles from two great
Radiohead albums: 1995’s The Bends, and
the 1997 classic, OK. Computer They are
the result of the band collaborating with
different directors in the production of a
visual representation of their music.

Each music video is both unique and
innovative while still expressing the idea
of the song. The animated clip for
“Paranoid Android,” directed by Magnus
Carlson, is based around a character
named Robin. Many unusual things hap-
pen to him in the video: He goes to a bar
where Radiohead is playing and gets
drunk, then watches a politician chop off
his own arms and legs, and later plays
ping—pong with an angel. ’

Inpthe clip for “No Surprises,” lead

singer Thom Yorke is featured wearing a
glass helmet on which the song lyrics are
reﬂected. The helmet slowly starts ﬁlling
up with water until Yorke is submerged for

57 seconds. The end result is very effective ‘

in conveying a feeling of suffocation.
The most interesting video, “Karma
Police,” features the viewer in a car with

Yorke in the back seat The car is chasing»

, As great as this video compilation is,
it could have been better. The biggest com-

containing only seven music videos.
Radiohead has released several excellent
videos that could have been included in a
second edition of this compilation, such as
those for “Go to Sleep” and “There,
There.” Let’s just hope that Radiohead
blesses us with a second volume of televi-
sion commercials in the future.

Dashboard Confessional leaves a mark

A MarkA Mission A Brand A Scar CD
Dashboard Confessional

' Far From Home Movies DVD

Vagrant Records
7i‘r79r7i‘r

In the radio-unfriendly, peach—fuzz genre of emo,

' Chris Carrabba’s Dashboard Confessional has quickly

become the poster boy for blending commercial and
artistic merit. His third studio album, A MarkA Mission
A Brand A Scar, stands proud as a testament, not only to
his evolution as a musician, but also to his acceptance
among those atop the emotional music ladder. Despite
his “Aw, shucks, I’m famous” public character,
Carrabba buckles down hard on A Mark with sharp pro-
fessionalism, like he’s finally become willing to accept
himself as more a credible rock songwriter than a cult
hero.

The truest barometer of Carrabba’s career has been
his smooth transition from “man with his guitar” on his
debut The Swiss Army Romance to “loose drums and
bass are OK, too” on the follow-up The Places You
Have Come To Fear the Most to, now, a fully—certiﬁed
band with A Mark. The full outﬁt not only supplies addi-
tional musical mirth, but also greatly ampliﬁes the
heart-string pulling of Carrabba’s tear-jerk lyrics. That’s
quite clear when you compare A Mark’s opening track
version of “Hands Down” to its acoustic predecessor.
Carrabba has both hands clenched tightly into fists this
time around.

And with those, he comes out swinging. Never V

before has Carrabba sounded so sure of himself, as he

now crafts lyrics of much—increased
maturity. Almost as if the full band gives
him increased conﬁdence, the songs are
just screaming “Don’t piss with me any-
more, I’m here for a reason.” Whether
he’s cracking open fresh bottles of beau-
ty on “Carry This Picture” or smothering
a shipwreck relationship on “Bend and
Not Break,” he’s got the whole gig
going on with bravado.

As any of his fans know,
Dashboard’s proof is in the pudding, and-
that pudding is of the big,‘ gloppy, lyrical
variety. There’s no letdown here,
although Carrabba’s playing more of the
twenty-something than the college ‘boy.
The smirks run straight across lines like
“You’ve -got your new ties/I’ve got my
old knots” or “You look better when out
of sight.” Even thetitles of the songs are
huge emo sledgehammers. Pillars
include “Carve Your Heart Out

Somebody get this boy a Kleenex.

Better save yourself a couple, too. All the pain, joy,

up in buffet form on A Mark, so be prepared to take in
as much as you can muster. The complementary DVD
is a welcome treasure» chest for both die-hards and new-
comers. It’s nothing fancy —— it’s basically just a short
jumble of cheaply recorded, live, acoustic performances
showcasing old and new material.

The emphasis falls on his older works, especially

songs from Swiss Army, and this serves as a great recap .

 it

for the casual Dashboard fan who most likely doesn’t
A have that LP. The rest of the DVD amasses some from-
V tl1e—studio conversation, providing the legions with

what Carrabba’s words always have: a look inside.
Don’t let  fool you on “Rapid Hope Loss,”
when he sings “Now, that I can ﬁnallywsee you/I don’t
think you’re‘“vvorth a second glance.” A MarkA Mission
A Brand A Scar might just do to you what you do to it:
wear things out. Don’t ‘worry: with emo, that’s a good
thing .

Harrisannos Getsy as backup

115"’

JOE MARCHILENA/SPORTS EDITOR

Pitt head coach Walt Harris named redshirt freshman Luke Getsy (No. 11) the

Panthers’ backup quarterback on Thesday.

DAVID SHEAROUSE
For The Pitt News

After a summer filled with
adversity and controversy, Pitt head
football coach Walt Harris is ready

to start the 2003 football season.

“It’s_ exciting to finally be in
game week,” Harris said during his
weekly press conference on
Tuesday.

However,’ before the season
opener Saturday night against Kent
State, Harris has once again been
forced to deal with controversy on
his football team. This time, the
storm centers around starting quar-
terback.Rod Rutherford’s encounter
with a 19-year-old woman at

Station Square early Monday morn— ‘

mg. -
“We’re in the process of gather-
ing information so we know what
happened,” Harrisisaid. “When we
know what happened, we will make
a decision.”

Rutherford’s situation is the
third in a series of off-field inci-
dents that have presented problems
for the Pitt football team this sum-
mer.  '
At the end of spring practice in
April, sophomore wide receiver

Larry Fitzgerald was compelled to
leave the team to attend his moth-
er’s funeral. Additionally, in June,
sophomore‘ wide receiver Billy
Gaines died after falling through a
church ceiling in Homestead.
Gaines, in addition to kicker David
Abdul, tight end Steve Buches,
guard John Simonitis and linemen
Neal Tracey and Joe Villani, had
been drinking that night at a church
cookout '

Despite these issues, Harris
believes that his football team is
ready ‘for the challenge that Kent
State will present to them on
Saturday night.

Kent State comes into Heinz
Field fresh off a last—second win
against Akron last Saturday. Junior
quarterback Joshua Cribbs, who
completed 25 of 43 passes for 340
yards and-three touchdowns last
week, leads the Golden Flashes
against a Pitt defense that Harris
has praised for its quickness.

“Joshua Cribbs is an outstand-
ing quarterback, [Antwan] Smith is
an outstandingslot [receiver], and
Alston is -a good “runner,” Harris
said.

Pitt moves into regional and national rankings

JOE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

In his first collegiate start, Pitt men’s soccer
goalie Justin Lowery shut out defending Big East
champion Boston College on Saturday, 1-0.

For his efforts, the redshirt sophomore goalie
was named Big East Goalkeeper of the Week.
Lowery made five saves in helping Pitt upset the
Eagles, who were ranked No. 13 at the time.

Also receiving-recognition was senior defend-
er Clay Haflich, who was named Big East
Defensive Player of the Week for the first time in
his career. A

The win also helped Pitt return to the national
rankings for the first time since Sept. 16 of last
year. , J .

The Panthers jumped up to the No. 18 spot in

- the Soccer America national poll and are also

ranked No. 4 in the Middle Atlantic region by the
National Soccer Coaches Association of America
poll. _

Pitt is one of five Big East teams ranked
among the top 25 by _Soccer America. The

Panthers return to action on Sept. 6 against No. 17
Hartwick College, in the opening game of the

Mayors Cup tournament hosted by Oneonta State. 3

The award’s preseason list will be narrowed

winner will be announced Dec. 11. '

Also receiving preseason honors last week
was quarterback Rod Rutherford, who was named
to the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award watch
list. The award annually commends the nation’s
top senior quarterback.

Rutherford became the first quarterback since
Alex Van Pelt in 1989 to lead Pitt to a bowl vic-
tory in his first season as a starter. He also
amassed »a school-record 3,181 total yards on
offense last season, a total that also ranks third in
Big East history.

The Golden Arm Award winner will be
announced on Dec. 4. Rutherford is also a candi-

Rutherford’s status should not effect early season games

Rod Rutherford’s recent brush with the law in
Station Square has spawned many rumors and is the
talk of the town among sportswriters and fans heading
into Pitt’s season opener against Kent State.

I’m not a priest, rabbi or district judge, so'I‘won’t
pass any moral judgment on Rutherford; there will be
plenty of knee—jerk outrage among said sportswriters
and fans over the next few weeks, whether justified or
not. 4

But as a coluirmist, I am interested in how
Rutherford’s off—the-field activities will affect the
Panthers on the ﬁeld and in the polls.

The details involving the Monday morning alterca- '
tion between Rutherford and a 19-year-old woman are
still sketchy, but if Rutherford faces criminal charges, it
is likely that the Panthers will suspend him for two or
three games. The scope of the effect that l$umeﬂord’s
potential absence willlhavelion ‘thetearn remains to be
seen, as it is based largely on timing.

If Rutherford avoids charges stemming from the c
altercation, or if a suspension begins with this‘ week-
end’s game against Kent State, then the Panthers won’t

A be greatly affected by Rutherford’s absence — at least

not in the short term.

Rutherford’s absence would likely give sophomore
Tyler Palko the nod at starting quarterback. And
although Palko hasn’t seen much playing time in his
collegiate career, he shouldn’t have any problem lead-
ing Pitt to victories over the Panthers’ first two ragtag
opponents, Kent State and Ball State.

How bad is Kent State’s defense?

It merely gave up 38 points and 447 total yards last
week to Akron. Kent State’s Golden Flashes forced no

  
 

t u r n o v e r s
against the
Zips and
Akron’s 407
p a s s i n g
yards made
Zips quarter-
back Charlie
Frye look
more like Carson Palmer. Add to this equation the fact
that the Panthers are 6-0 in season opening contests

    

under Walt Harris, and that the Golden Flashes are 0-6,

against Pitt al1—tirne, and you get a Pitt blowout — even

with Rerun from “What’s Happening” at quarterback.
Ball State provides even less of a roadblock for the

Panthers. The Cardinals will meet Missouri, a team that

_ifushed.for 22 lyards against them last year, this week-

end. Lookfor that number to go down slightly this sea-
son. Ball State returns three starting defensive linemen
from last, season, but still doesn’t boast a formidable
run—stopping defense. ’ 4 . . ,
With this lack of ability to stop the run, all Palko
will have to do to secure a Pitt victory against Ball State
is hand the ball off to tailback Brandon Miree 30 times."
Pitt’s third opponent, Toledo, may prove to be
more of a problem. The Rockets’ dink-and-dunk
offense proved to be effective against the Panthers last
season at Heinz Field, particularly in the first half. That
doesn’t bode well for Pitt’s defense on the road, as it
returns only one starting linebacker from last season.
Pitt may have to put a lot of points on the board against

fTo1edo in a game featuring two athletic offenses. But

that shouldn’t be a problem, as the Panthers scored 37

   

9 Ti new.‘

points and exploded for 469 yards against the Rockets
last season. The presence of Miree will once again
relieve Palko of some of the scoring burden, and Larry
Fitzgerald’s ability to smoke Toledo’s comerbacks
downfield will resurface and give Palko an easy target
to throw to. -

This isn’t to say‘ that a Rutherford suspension
won’t cause major, long-term problems for the
Panthers. Pitt’s coaching staff had hoped to redshirt
Palko this season, allowing him three remaining sea-
sons of NCAA eligibility. Starting Palko against Kent
State will render him ineligible for redshirt status this
season, barring injury.

Another potential problem for Rutherford is

rhythm. Rutherford used some extremely shaky non-'

conference performances last year to establish a rapport
with his receivers. and emerge as one of the most pro-
ductive passers in the Big East. If Rutherford has to
come in and start cold against Texas A&M on Sept. 27,
he will face a hostile Kyle Field crowd and a brutal
linebacking corps that chased him all over the ﬁeld last
year. That could spell trouble for the Panthers, who
aren’t used to facing Big 12 opponents on the road. *
If Texas A&M comes into the picture for Palko, or
if the Aggies face a cold Rutherford, then things could
get ugly for the Panthers. But don’t expect Pitt’s 19-‘
game winning L streak against Mid—American
Conference foes to come to an end against Kent State,

Ball State "or Toledo, regardless of who plays quarter-

back.

Harris appreciates elite status,
but says team is still untested

Harris, page 9

When Pitt faces off against the
Golden Flashes on Saturday night,
it will look to maintainits perfect
record against teams from the Mid-
American Conference.

-“We have great respect for the
MAC,” Harris said. “The entire
league is filled with good teams and
good coaches.” S

In order for Pitt to win on
Saturday night, Harris said, his
team must take care of the football.
Harris expects running back
Brandon Miree to be a dominating
runner and looks forward to watch-
ing junior wide receiver Princell
Brockenbrough in his first game.

“[Offensive coordinator] J.D.
[Brookhart] has done a real nice job
with Princell,” Harris said. “We’re
looking forward to watching him

‘ play when it counts.”

Harris also took Tuesday’s press
conference as an opportunity to
announce who would be the backup
quarterback. The announcement is
especially relevant, given
Rutherford’s current predicament.

“Luke Getsy is our backup
quarterback,” Harris said. “We feel
he gives ‘us more as our backup
quarterback.” ,

The announcement generates
yet more controversy, given the
presence of much-touted sopho-
more quarterback Tyler Palko on
the team. However, Harris said that
Palko took the announcement in
stride, and praised theyoung man
for his team spirit. -

“Tyler is a tremendous competi-
tor,?’ Harris added. “His goal is to

become a better football player, and
his goal is my goal.”

Harris is unsure about what to
expect from his team in the first
game on Saturday night, saying that
he has been ﬂattered by all the pre-
season attention his team has gar-
nered, but also noted that his team
has not won a game yet and has not
proven anything.

“We’re proud of being an elite
team,” Harris added. “But we’re
going to find out some things
Saturday night at 7, and beyond.”
