U-All Can Come,
States McQuade

First SFA Tea Dance Of Semester
Scheduled For February 17

“All-Uze guys and gals ’ll want to
come when you know what we got”
says William McQuade, CE36, SFA
Social Chairman in announcing the
ﬁrst SFA tea dance of the year.

This opening afternoon affair will
suffer the title “All-U” even if, Mc-
Quade admits, the “youze” belongs to
the bowery and not his tea dance. As
it was told, the All-U blessing bloom-
ed from a promising argument be-
tween one Charles Ebert, C36, Vice-
chairman, andla local representative
of the Dental school.

The argument itself was perfectly
on the level, but when the erstwhile
boxing manager shook a ﬁnger and
said ‘‘All you Dents do is . . ."
That started it. VVil1iam Hughes, C36,
business manager, got the idea, and
now we have the All-U Dance. In -.1
normal condition, however, they ad-
mitted that All-U also means a dance
for everyone.

Earl Mellen and his Hotel Cham-
berlain orchestra will play for the
dancing from 3 to 6 o’clock, February
17, one week from today. The Schen-
ley Ballroom, checking faci'ities, and
foyers have been secured for the at-
fair.

Britton Will Prepare
For Engineers’ Dance

 

 

William Britton, ChE36, has been
chosen as chairman of the Engineer-
ing Association Dance, the highlight
of the technicians’ social season,
which will be held on March 6.

Tickets priced at $1, according to
Chairman Britten, also will permit
the holder to attend the smoker which
the association will present later in
the year.

While the outcome of Governor]
George H. E-arle’s demands upon the
University administration still hung
me, a resolution backing wholeheart-
edly the stand taken in the contro-
versy by Chancellor John G. Bow-
man was passed Saturday by the
Alumni Council of the University.

The resolution, stating a resent-
ment for “any injection of political in-
ﬂuences in University affairs” and ex-
pressing conﬁdence in the Chancellor
and the Board of Trustees, was under-
signed by Harold Obernaurer, presi-
dent of the council. speaking for more
than 60,000 alumni and former stu-
dents of the University. The com-
plete text of the resolution follows:

Whereas, the members of the
Alumni Council of the University
of Pittsburgh resent any injection
of political influences into Univer.
sity affairs,

And whereas, more than sixty
thousand alumni and former stu-
den’s of the University, most of
whom are residents of Pennsyl-
Vania, are vitally interested in all

And whereas, any curtailment of

munity would impose great hard-
ship on large numbers of students
who are dependent upon the Uni-

servity for an education; to the fam- ‘
ilies of such students and to a large 1

and loyal faculty; -

Be it -resolved, that the Alumni
Council express to the Chancellor
of the University and to the Board

University in the great service it is
rendering to the citizens of the
Commonwealth and this community.

And be it further resolved, that
the Alumni Council call upon all
alumniand friends of the University
to oppose actively any political inter-
ference in University affairs.

YM-YWCA Plan
‘Religion Week’

Combined Group Gives Tentative
Arrangements For Meetings

Tentative plans have been released
from the YM-YVVCA headquarters for
the Religious Emphasis ‘Week, which
is to be held at the University during
the second week of the new semester,
from February 17 to 21.

The central ﬁgure during the meet-
ing of the week will be Dr, Henry
H. Crane from Scranton. Dr. Crane
was selected to take charge of the
proceedings because of his ability to
get his subject across to the student
body as a. whole. He is no stranger
to college campi, having spoken at
Penn State, Duke, Ohio Vvesleyan,
and other universities of this district.

To aid Dr. Crane, prominent men
in religious circles of the city have
also a large part to play in making
the undertaking a success. Such
men as Dean ‘Moor, Dr. Garth, Dr.
Muir, Dr. Clausen, Dr. Freehof, and
Father Pauley, are among the lead-
ers.

It is expected that in addition to
the assemblies to be held in Memorial
Hall, some of the leaders will ad-
dress smaller groups such as the Pit-
kin Club, Group X, Engineers’ Club,
and some of the freshman groups. The
joint YM-YWCA Association Night, to
be held during the middle of the
week, will feature some of these
speakers during its program,

ably appoint someone this week.

Beryl Rock Crystals
Donated To University

Geology Department Receives: Second
Gift Of Minerals From Student

 

Two curious hexagonal crystals of
beryl, the rock in‘ which aqua-marine
is found, have been presented to the
geology department of the University
by David Seaman, graduate student
in geology, according to Henry Leigh-
ton, professor and head of the depart-
ment.

The crystals were found in Bow-
doin, Maine, last summer by Mr. Sea-
man, and are considered ﬁne speci-
mens. One weights 26 pounds and
the other 24. Both are almost per-
fectly shaped hexagonals.

This is the second time Mr. Seaman
has presented the geology depart-
ment with beryl, the ﬁrst contribution
having come from Portland, Connecti-
cut. Beryl is found in quarries, often
with feldspar which is used in the

'l‘rackmen’s Fun,
Olympics’ Funds
Assured Saturday

Tickets For Pitt News Meet Sell
Rapidly As Track Performers
Prepare To Crack Records

By Edwin H. Beachler
V-Vhen some 81 of Pitt’s ﬁnest track
; and field performers take their marks
-in the track house Saturday at 2
o'clock, the opening shot in the col-

legiate campaign for the Olympic
Fund will be fired.
The Pitt News Olympic Fund

Track and Field Meet has made the
University a leader in supporting the
campaign to raise funds for the Amer-
ican Entry.

Saturday’s track show probably
breaks precedent again in that even
competitors and officials will pay to
participate. The extreme is reached
when Coaches Olson and Potts admit
"they “have each bought at least four
tickets for the privilege of coaching
the boys who will attempt to crack a
few existing records.”

According to a report received on
January 31, two weeks following the
édecision to stage The Pitt News bene-
-ﬁt, Major J. L. Griffith, president of
the National Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation, suggestedto members of the
NCAA that “since some of the teams
will be composed almost exclusively
of college undergraduates and recent
graduates, it is ﬁtting that college
sportsmen lend their support to this
worthy cause.” ,

Continuing, he urged that “the re-
sponse of not only those who are in-
terested in the Olympic movement,
but also all who are likewise inter-
ested in college athletics should be
very generous.”

In the same report, District com-
{mittee chairmen were appointed for
‘territorial units, corresponding to the
eight districts of the NCAA in order
to systematize the collection of funds
from educational institutions.

W. ‘D. Harrison, director of ath-
letics, received the District 2 ap-
pointment. Schools under his super-
vision for the drive include those in
¥]ie states of Delaware, New Jersey,

ew York, Pennsylvania,
Virginia.

Officials Are Important

Letters have been written to se-
cure adequate officials to handle the
meet. This department will be quite
important since only once a year does
Olson recognize records for the In-
door boards as official.

6

Several of the recognized marks
have been unofficially bettered, indi-
cating that in Saturday’s races many
standards will go tumbling by the
boards.‘ _

In the Invitation AMA champion-
ships last. month, Walter‘ Good leaped
to 44 feet, two inches, bettering his
former record by nine and one-half
inches in the hop, step, and jump.

Sol Menaker looks like a sure bet
at least to equal Arvel Fleming’s 5.4-
second hold on the 50-yard dash. Dick
Mason, however, will press Sol to the
limit in this varsity race,

Perhaps the biggest upheaval is
expected in the half mile. Charley
Groa.t, outdoor title-holder, and John-
ny Vt-Ioodruff, freshman sensation,

Dr. King To Lecture
On Chemical Subjects

Vvithin the next two months, Dr.
Charles King, professor of chemistry,
has ﬁve lectures scheduled before
groups in Michigan, Ohio, Maryland,
and Toronto, Canada.

Dr. King will speak before sections
of the American Chemical Society in
Lansing, Michigan, today; Detroit,
Michigan, lOlllOl‘l‘OW;= and Toledo,
Ohio, Wednesday. His subject at each
of these meeting will be “The Anti-
scorbutic Vitamins.”

At the School of Hygiene and Pub-
lic Health of Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, Baltimore, Dr. King will speak
on "The Pre-Scorb-utic State,” on
March 10. The Chemical Association
of Toronto has asked Dr. King to ad-
dress its meeting at Toronto on
March 19. His subject will be “Syn-
thetic Glycerides.”

Pitt Players To Give ‘Candida’ Twice
Next Week On Civic Playhouse Stage

 

The new Pittsburgh Civic Play-
house at 222 Craft Avenue will play
host to Pitt Players Vvednesday and

— Thursday nights
of next week,
when the Players
give “Candida,” a
sophisticated play
by George Ber-
nard Shaw, at
that location.

The old Ger-
man Club former-
ly occupied that
part of: the build-
ing which is now

 

t h e Playhouse.
The room has
been completely

remodeled, and is

Maura" equipped with
the latest and ﬁnest in little theater
accoutrements. It has a seating ca-
pacity of 250.

Pitt Players and the Playhouse

group have been cooperating with
each other for several years in the
borrowingpof equipment and proper-
ties. Numerous members of the Play-
ers group, too, have “graduated” into
roles with the city organization.

There will be no preliminary per-
formance at the Irene Kaufmann Set-
tlement House, contrary to custom.
Eleven opening performances have
been given there by Pitt Players over
the past few years. The Settlement
has banned “Candida” because of
moral implications.

Louise McKirdy, C36, Herrymon
Maurer, C36, and Marquis Patterson,
C36, handle the three leading parts
in the Shavian drama. This will be
Miss McKirdy’s second lead role in
Pitt Players shows. Patterson has ap-
peared previously in offerings of the
organization, but Maurer makes his
debut as another “ﬁnd” of Director
Carl B. Cass.

Spitz Quadruplets Born
01': Alumni Hall Landing

Rivaling in publicity the famed
Dionnes of Caiiada are the four
pups and their mother, a Spitz,
who startled a student audience
at the middle stairway in Alumni
Hall last Friday at 12:30 o’c.ock.

The report, issued by Julius
Falcs, janitor in Alumni Hall, is
to the effect that mother and pup-
lettes are doing well. Following
the spectacular birth in the middle
stairway ward, the pups and their
grinning mother were photograph-
ed, stared at, and congratuatetl.
This is the first event of its kind
in University history.

Two of the pups have been taken
into the Medical School, where
they will receive expert care. The
other two and their ‘bother were
taken by the Animal Rescue
League.

School Of Mines
Gets $10,000 Gift

Graduate Stipulates Fund Be Used
For Oil And Gas Department

Acknowledgement has recently been
made of an agreement made last De-
cember by which the University re-
ceived a gift of $10,000 from George
M. Bevier, internationally known oil
geologist. Mr. Bevier is a graduate of
the University School of Mines. He
received his bachelor's degree in 1913.

Provisions of the agreement state
that the donation known as the

“George M. Bevier Fund,” shall be in-

vested by the University and the in-
come used for the beneﬁt of the
School of Mines. The donor desires
especially that the oil and gas depart-
ment of the school be the chief bene-
ﬁciary of the endowment. He intends
that the fund will be increased to
$100,000.

While serving a.s chief geologist and
geophysicist for the Gulf Coast Divi-
sion of the Pure Oil Company,'Mr.
Bevier discovered several important
oil ﬁelds in Texas. Among them are
the Van and the Conroe oil ﬁelds
which have a combined potential pro-
duction of 1,150,000,000 barrels.

Panther To Issue
Result Of Polls

Surveys In Cramming, Fashions
To Feature February Number

The Pitt Panther appearing here
and there on Vilednesday will be full

of polls. Three, to be exact.
One canvass, conducted by the
Panther staff, concerns the relative

merﬁs of cramming on ﬁnal exams
and the number of students who em-
ploy that method. The tabulation has
been kept so secret that no one knows
whether the results are startling or
not.

Gene Burkhart, C36, has gone to
some lengths to compile and analyze

the views of men-about-campus on
clothes and style trends. And, to end
the cycle, Robert Saffron, C39,

satirizes the opinions of ﬁve contem-
porary newspaper columnist on the
question “Is There a Constitution?’

Harry Robinson, C36, and Edwin
Beachler, C37, discuss the University’s
preparation for track entries and
participation in the Olympics in "On
to Olympia.”

A short story by Helen Rose Gib-
son, C36, with a department store
locale, and a punny article on cam-
pus romances by Irene Matveak,
Ed3'7, round out the features.

The funniest of the exchange car-
toons will also be shown in this issue,
promises Editor Russ Connolly, C36.

Book Exchange
Moves Quarters
Into Cathedral

The Student Book Exchange spon-
sored by SFA is now in operation in
the center of the second ﬂoor hall of
the Cathedral. Books “wanted” or
“for sale” may be catalogued there
from 10:30 to 2:30 o’clock every day
until Friday.

The committee wishes to emphasize
the fact that all books will be cata-
logued alphabetically by author; that
it is imperative for all students to
know the author’s name before at-
tempting to locate any book in the
ﬁle. Students a.re also requested to
remove cards from the ﬁle as soon
after making the transaction as possi-
ble. This will eliminate unnecessary
overloading of the drawers and will
particularly relieve students from the
bother of answering or making use-
less Phone calls.

Committee members in charge of
the’ exchange include: Elinor Scott
and Chalmers Brown, Co-chairmen,
Mary Jane Beachler, Francis Devlin,
Arthur Kelly, Harriet Lewis, Ray-
mond Maclntyre, Charles McLain,
Marion Messer, and Eleanor Sand-
burg. Mr. J. Howard Dice, Univer-
sity Librarian, is faculty adviser.

Executive Committee Meeting
Does Not Reach Problem

Following a meeting Friday of the
body's Executive Committee, the en-
tire University Board of Trustees is
to convene today, according to Dr. S;

sity.
VVhether or not the Board will
take up the question of Governor

George H. Earle’s “ultimatum” in re-
gard to certain "libera£izing” measures
be has set down for the trustees to
follow is uncertain, Dr. Linhart told
The Pitt News Friday evening.

The Governor, in a letter to George
H. Clapp, president of the Board,
stated Vvednesday that “unless the
full recommendations of the Investi-
gating Committee of the Legislature,
with the exception of the reduction of
two of the number of appointments
to the Board to be made by the gov-
ernor, are carried out by March 1,
1936, all future appropriations of
state aid for the University of Pitts-
burgh will be disapproved.”

In a. meeting Friday, the Executive
Committee of the trustees met for a
discussion solely of ﬁnancial and bud-
get matters, as had been previously
planned.

Members of the committee are: Mr.
Clapp, Chancellor John G. Bowman,
Howard Irish, Joseph C. Trees, C. W‘.
Ridinger, and Ernest T. VVeir.

Bureau To Make
Property Survey

Long-Period Real Estate Records
Will Be Analyzed For Study

A real estate survey, designed to
conduct an analysis of the records in
reral estate activity over a fairly long
period of time, will be supervised by
the Bureau of Business Research of
the University. The project is spon-
sored by the Department of City Plan-
ning and will be ﬁnanced by the
Works Progress Administration.

Theodore A. Veenstra, instructor in
statistical research and statist.icia.n
for the bureau, will direct the survey
in conjunction with the VVPA director,
Scott Keyes, graduate of Penn State
and graduate student at the Univer-
sity.

According to J. P. VVatson, assistant
director of the Bureau of Business Re-
search, the survey will include in its
data a study of the subdivision of
land, deeds recorded or land transfers,
mortgages recorded, mortgages fore-
closed a.nd new buildings.

Information for the survey will be
obtained principally from public rec-
ords of both city and county. The
bureau hopes that the project can
be carried through far enough for
suflicient data to be compiled to pub-
lish monograph reports. Such analysis
of data would be similar to the recent
coal study of which Veenstra was co-
author. Also to be published would
be “data books” which‘Watson de-
scribed as great sets of tables of .in-
formation.

Owl To Hold Contest

The Owl, University yearbook this
year sponsors a snapshot contest.

The photographer of the picture
concerning campus life which is ad-
judged best in the opinion of the Owl
staff will be awarded a copy of the
1936 Owl with his name engraved on
the cover.

Entries should be submitted as soon
as possible to the Owl oiﬁce, Room
709, Cathedral.

The Big Stick
OVERNOR EARLE, who usually steps pretty
giiigcrly in territ.or_v where the attitude of
possible constituents is concerned, appears to
have made something of a misstep in his “ultima-
’ to the University. Even the most astute
“liberals,” whose particular delight seems to be in

:ﬁn_din‘g fault with the Univei'sit.y’s administration,
_must, in the line of policy, rally behind that admin-

isti-ation’s ﬁrm stand in keeping politics out of the
school.

i“\‘Ieaiiwliile. developments in the controversy

‘have "found the protessional press right on the spot

with accounts which, in a ludicrous manner, have
almost reached “inning by inning” proportions.

Harrisburg corner have been set forth. daily in or-
derl_v alterna-tion, with a referee’s decision expect-
ed soon.

The demands of the governor insist upon a revi-
sion of ineniliership in the Board of Trustees and
iiu'ii.‘.'e security of tenure for the University ’s fac-
ulty. Steps dealing with these proposals, ﬁrst ad-
vanced by the legislative investigating committee
last spring, are already being taken by the Univer-
sity." The one step the administration refuses to
take is that of allowing two (.i:'ormerly five were
(lemancled) trusteeships to be allotted to guberna-
torial. appointment.

Suggestionsadvanced by the Board of Trustees.

t_lia.t'tl1e Speaker of the House and the President of
‘l.-li'e_ Senate be made ex-ofﬁcio members of the body
and that they should assume like positions .in all
other state-aided institutions didn’t strike Earle
as being at all favorable. He claims that the inat-
ter of his two appointments is not so important,
but on Friday he wa_s still insisting upon that part
in his demands.

V\7here all this will end nobody knows. The Uni-
versity has made its stand unswervingly and will
continiie whelihcr or not the governor chooses to
wave the big stick of cutting off the school ’s state
appropriation. If he does that,_there will be many
voters who will not i?o1',9;et it the next time they see
the name Earle on a "ballot.

_ The Missing Card
, lTR-ING THE PRE-REGISTRA’l‘IO;\' and be-
tween-semesters 1’9§),'l,Si.I‘al«lOl1 periods, every
uppcrclassinau went througli the business of
sli.ii't'flin;z' a sizeable pack of cards and i'requeutl.y
complaining‘ about tlie bother of it all. Yet tliere
\=..'ere but a :-‘:'ew who realized that there was one
less card to handle than they had last year.

That card was the one thrust into the registra-
tion scheine then by the Student Faculty Assem-
bly in an attenipt to form a basis for more honest
voting procedures in campus elections. The card
held a st.udentw's signature, which could be used
for identiﬁcation by polls officials, and spaces for
clicckiiig off the student as he voted at each elec-
1,.io:-1. For some reason or other, a similar card
d?dii’t get .into the registration proceeding‘s for
ihis seiiiester. There have been a few people in-
terested enough in campus governing affairs to
ask, why not? '

The SFA group is now faced with the problem
of finding a. substitute for that system, which. ad-
mittedly worked very smoothly last year. Finding
the substitute system is not an inipossibility, for
there are several. And truly enough it is not the
method, but the integrity of the polls officials
which makes the voting procedure a success or
failure. ~

The fact remains that a lot of unnecessary
bother could have been avoided if someone had
remembered to add the voting “rider” to registra-
tion. But maybe everyone was too busy thawing
out his feet then to look ahead towards elections
in the sweet spring.

  

It seems that every once in a while the down-
town papers forget and leave Pitt out of ‘the head-
lines.

Graduates Urged
To File Teaching
Applications Soon

 

eFebruary graduates in the School
of Education and in other schools
who are preparing to teach in Penn-
sylvania, should ﬁle certiﬁcate appli-
cation forms promptly, according to
Theodore A. Siedle, assistant to the
dean of the school.

Forms, and information about ﬁll-
ing‘ them out, may be obtained in
Room 210, State Hall. Since it takes
time to prepare records at the Univer-
sity and to review these records and
prepare certiﬁcates in Harrisburg,
Mr. Siedle pointed out that it is de-
sirable to ﬁle applications early with
the University registrar.

June graduates may ﬁle their cer-
tiﬁcate applications at any time dur-
ing the second semester.

Dukes Topple Panthers
As Malackney Sparkles

Carlsonmen Hold Bluffites Even In Second Half,
But Winners’ Start Brings 54-42 Victory

 

By Harry E.

Robinson, Jr.

All the nice things that people said about Duquesne’s cage team
were true, but they didn’t say enough about a slightly bald sopho-
more nained Malackney. The Rankin redhead scored 21 points to

help t.he “perfect ball club” turn
the Panthers on Saturday night.

in an amazing 5-1-42 victor_v over

Nothing short of covers over the baskets could have helped the
Pitt boys to stop Malackney. In the ﬁrst half he accounted for 14 of
the Duke ’s 29 points on ﬁve field goals and four fouls, but he slowed
down a bit in the last half and made only seven markers.

With a partisan crowd of 5.0009

watching the battle, the I-Iilltoppers
took the 1ea.d at the outset, and from
that point until the ﬁnal whistle
sounded they were never seriously
threatened. Within the ﬁrst ten min-
utes of play, they had piled up a 20-5
lead and coasted to a 29-17 margin
at half time.

Malackney started the ‘ﬁreworks
with a long shot that clickedto give
the Dukes a 2-0 advantage. Kweller’s
penalty ﬂing and four more points by
the redhead widened the gap to sev-
en. Captain Roderck entered the
game and counted with a ﬁeld goal,
followed by a foul shot by Jesko, and
the Panthers trailed by 8-3.

Two-plyers by Dresmich, Malack-
ney, and Miller and fouls by Bonn,
Miller, and Malackney soon built the
lead to 20-5, Roderick having added
to the Pitt total with a couple of foul
shots. The Panthers’ attack improved
in the ﬁnal minutes of the ﬁrst half
to allow them to narrow the differ-
ence to 12 points, Jesko and Zeleznick
ripping iii the points.

Airhart and Kreiling raised the
Duke total to 32 shortly after the sec-
ond half began, and Malackiiey and
Kreiling made the score 35-20, Noon
and Spotovich having countered with
a ﬁeld goal and a foul. Dresmich’s
three points and another bucket by
Malackney, who by this time Was as
dangerous to the Panthers as “M”
was to the Germans, gave the Dukes
a comfortable 40-25 lead.

The Cats dug in to narrow the gap
to 40-30 on points by Radvansky and
Jesko, but the Red and Blue machine
paced by the Rankin sophomore add-
ed four more points, and wlth Seven
minutes remaining to play held a 44-
33 lead.

Cats Narrow Gap

Coach Davies returned three of his
ﬁrst stringers, Miller, Bonn, and
Kweller to the ball game, each having
been temporarily shelved because of
three personals on thém. but that
didn’t keep the Panthers from coming
to within nine points of them at 45-36.
Airliart, who spent most of his eve-
ning on the foul line, tossed in three
free throws, Miller, Dresmich, and
Bonn got ﬁeld. goals, and Malackney
got his 21st point via -the foul line
route to close the Duke stock market
at 54.

Jlesko turned in his ﬁfth’ -andsixth
ﬁeld goals of the evening.-and Joliiisoii
got one to wind up the scoring for
Pitt. - V . '

Bill Jesko dropped in six ﬁeld goals
and four fouls to help the Pitt team
stay in the running and was probably
the outstanding player for the Panth-
ers. Zeleznick, with eight‘ points,
took second scoring honors for the
Blue and Gold. '

The boys from the Bluff excelled in
foul shooting, making 18 in 22 tries.
Pjtt players fell down in this depart-
ment, sinking only 12 out of 21.

Vvith Co-captain ‘Walt Miller guid-
ing his team on the ﬂoor, the Hilltop-
pers put on one of the ﬁnest exhibi-
tions of basketball ever staged on the
Stadium pavilion.

The Panthers, badly off in their
shooting on Saturday evening, get a
chance to revenge this defeat on Feb-
ruary 18 when the two. city rivals
meet again. In the meantime all that
Pitt supporters can hope for is that
Davies doesn’t have any more trumps
like Malackney to throw in when a
regular goes down with injuries.

Little Panthers Win, 28-26

A trio of ﬁeld goals thrown by
Lawry, Fabel, and Sheiding in the last
few minutes of play gave Coach
Dockey Kowallis’ freshman quintet a
28-26 victory over the Duquesne frosh
in a fast preliminary struggle.

Holding a 17-11 advantage at half
time, the Panther yearlings went into
reverse in the third period to allow
the Little Dukes to forge ahead. How-
ever a last minute ﬂurry of ﬁeld goals
by Fabel, Lawry, and Sheiding turned
the tables.

Fabcl and Lawry, with six and sev-
en points, respectively, were high-
point men for Pitt, while Weitzel and

Penn State Lions
Prove Too Tough
For Pitt Matmen

It was. a mighty lean day for the
Panther wrestlers when they grappled
with the Penn State team at the Lions’
lair Saturday. All that the Nittany
ﬁghters did was to score a complete
whitewash victory over Pitt and run
their string of consecutive match tri-
umphs to 11, the Lions not having
been defeated since niidseason of
1934.

Rudy Tomarelli, ﬁghting at 126
pounds, and Alex Kodashov, Panther
heavyweight, were the only Pitt
wrestlers able to avoid being thrown,
although both lost by time advantages.
Five other bouts were won on falls
by the experienced Staters, while
Pitt’s Captain Bedillion was forced to
forfeit the 135-pound match to Cap-
tain Light, of State.

The summary;

118-pounds — Frederick Stegmaier, Penn

State, threw Bernard Babcock, with a crotch
and half Nelson in 3:36.

126-pounds—Samuel Wolfson,
defeated Rudy
6:19.

135-pounds——Capt. Light. Penn State, won
by default from Russell Bedillion.

1-15-pounds—Richai‘d W'aite. Penn State,
threw Albert‘ Noble with a forearm and body
press in 3:05.

155-p3unds4—John Calvin, Penn State, threw
Harold Neibel with head hold and wrist lock
in 7 :10.

‘I65-pounds——-Joseph Krupa, Penn State,
threw George Simonoff with a bar lock in
7 :46.

175‘-pouiids——Ross Shaffer, Penn State.
threw Luke Richards with a. body hold in
3:05.

ical education, the faculty bowling
league is entering its fourth week of
team play. Eight teams make up the
loop. ' .

"This evening, the Engineers, cap-
tained by ‘Bill Brinker, will roll the
VVild Cats, a team composed of Mellon
Instituters. The second encounter
brings together the historians, phil-
osophers, and English teachers whose
composite group will tangle with the
-Printers.

Another match ﬁnds the Business
Administration ' economists, account-
ants, and others meeting the Deans

have both cracked the accepted stand-
ard. Coniielly has also lowered his
recognized title of 2 minutes, 2 sec-
onds for this middle distance event.

Virtually all the yearling titles have
been threatened by a freshman crew
under Coach Potts, that promises to
be the ﬁnest in history at the Uni-
versity.

In a trial meet, Cooper ran a 5.5-
secoiid 50-yard dash, trailed closely by
Parsons, oiie-teiith of a second under
Browii’s mark. Parsons, sharing lioii-
ors with W'oodruff as the outstanding
prospects in the class of 1939, knock-
ed foiir-tenths of a second from the
highs, and two-tenths from the low
hurdles.

Coach Olson plans to allow only
three entries in each running event,
with the exception of the distance
runs. This will offer every opportu-
iiity'to the outstanding boys who hope
to crack a few of those indoor rec-
ords. It should be easier for the
spectators to follow the individual
performers.

Twelve laps equal a mile on the
banked, cinder track in the track
house. The sprints can be run off
on a 50-yard straight-a-way on the
east. side of the track.

Approximately 300 chairs have been
placed in the ﬁeld house and even
more will be secured depending on the
ticket sale by meet time.

Plenty of Competition

A tentative list of the lineup in
the various events calls for three
dashmen to be chosen from the var-
sity group of Meiiaker, Spitz, Mason,
Thomas, Hood, and Lasky, and a sim-
ilar number from Glenn Cooper, Ed-
son Routch, Joe Menske, Charles
Poole, Ralph Parsons, John Moffett,

Freshman Boxers
Face Allegheny Y
Mittnzeraz Today

Freshman boxers who heretofore
have had to be content with getting
rid of surplus energy on either the
punching bags or their fellow class-
mates will now have a chance to un-
lea.sh their fury and skill on outside
opponents. Today the freshmen trade
punches with the ring representatives
of the Allegheny YMCA a-t the Alle-
gheny Y.

Tod-ay’s match will inaugurate a
series of freshman matches which is
aimed to give experience and develop-

ient to the potential University ring-
men.

In the 115-poiind class, Fred Bo-
narati will receive his ﬁrst baptism
into competitive ring warfare. Bob
Gray in the 125-pound class will also
be throwing his punches for the ﬁrst
time in this type of competition.

Intramural champion Ralph Ca-
rouso will be entered in the 135-pouiid
division with another intramural
champion in 155-pound Steve Horton.
Horton also has a year of Golden
Gloves ﬁghting behind him and looms
as a bright prospect.

In the 145—pound match the Pitt
yearlings will have Mike Iannuzzi,
while Emil Halley will be in Panther
trunks for the 165-pound match.

Rounding out the brigade of Pitt
ringnien will be George Lupinacci in

Lambda Chi Captures League A Lead 1
In Interfraternity Bowling Tourney

First place berths are still insecure
as both leagues of the Iiiterfraterni-ty
Bowling Championship reach the last
frame tomorrow and Wednesday even-
ings at the Center-Neville alleys.

The biggest ﬁreworks will ﬂare in
League A, where Lambda Chi Alpha,
Phi Kappa, and Delta Tau Delta are

still very much in the running. At ,

present the Lambda Chis, who added
three more markers to their win col-
umn Wednesday by virtue of a forfeit
from the Sigma Alpha Mus, have
edged Phi Kappa. out of the top posi-
tion for the ﬁrst time since the tour-
iiament began.

However, only 17 percentage points
separate the League A leaders, and to-
mori'ow’s match which b-rings them
together will go a long way in decid-
ing the title—bearer.

In League B Phi Delta’s most dan-
gerous contender is Pi Kappa Alpha
who they meet on Wediiesday in the
match that will produce the league

Sigma Chis and I.--‘-lEs, respectively,
Pi Kappa Alpha took two and drop-
ped one to the Kappa Sigs. Standings:

To Speak Before
Parlance Unit

Forum Discussion To Follow Talk;
Student Debaters From Local
Schools Will Also Attend

Under the sponsorship of the Pitt
Parlance, freshman women’s public
speaking unit, Attorney John Henry,
authority on the Supreme Court, will
speak in Room 801, Cathedral, ’l‘hurs-
day evening at 7 o'clock, on Congress
and the Supreme Court.

Mr. Henry, author of the recently
published book about the Supreme
Court, “Nine Above the Law,” was
chief speaker on Dr. Clausen’s radio
forum on the Supreme Court last
Tuesday night. Last year Attorney
Henry spoke before the Hungry Club
on the Court’s usurpation of legisla-
tive power.

An open forum discussion will fol-
low Mr. iHenry’s address Thursday,
which will be open to all students of
the University. In addition, debaters
from Pennsylvania College for VVo-
men, Mount Mercy College, Duquesne
University, and the Carnegie Institute
of Technology have been invited to
attend.

Both the Men’s and Women's De-
bating Association on the campus
have been working on the Supreme
Court question for the past few
months prepara.tory to a series of in-
tercollegiate debates on the subject:
“Resolved, that Congress should have
the power to over-ride by a two-thirds
vote decisions of the Supreme Court
declaring acts of Congress unconstitu-
tional.”

The men have already started their
intercollegiate season, one team at
present debating the question on a
two-week tour of colleges and univer-
sities in the South. On the southern
trip the University is being represent-
ed by Israel Goldberg, C36, and Albert
Brandon, C36.

The VVomen’s Debating Association
will present its ﬁrst extension debate
on the Supreme Court on February
18. Preliminary to this, members are
submitting written speeches on the
question, holding group discussion
meetings and practice debates, and
having individual drilling on their
speeches.

Thursday night, WSGA appointed
Virginia Luckhart, C, to the position
on Senior Court left vacant by the
resignation of Ruth Seitz, C. The

nounced. New appointees were not

ed the problems of committee chair-

the reports of the last year's chairmen
to guide them, but representatives
have no such guide. The old methods
of attack were discussed and new
methods were suggested.

A report was submitted by the
chairman of the women’s reading
room committee,’ Nancy Metcalf, C38,
concerning plans for the women’s
room of the new library on the fourth,
ﬁfth, and sixth ﬂoors of the Cathe-
dral. No outside help is being asked,
so all contributions must come from
the organizations on the campus. All
organizations are asked to contribute.

Among other business, a new hous-
ing plan was discussed. This new
plan includes planning of campus life
for those women living in student
houses, and those living away from
homes with relatives or in rooming
houses. Anne June Elmer, C36, will
head the housing committee. The
other members are being chosen from
among the women whom the new plan
would affect.

Guests of WSGA at the meeting

ler, members of WSGA at PCW, and
Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of men.

YWCA:—Cabinet Plans
Program For Semester

The visit of Dr. Henry Crane. of
Scranton, to the campus on Feb-
ruary 17, will be one of the items con-
sidered by the YWCA cabinet when it
meets tomorrow. This meeting held
at the Heinz House at 12:30 o’clock,
is to discuss the program of the
spring season of the YWCA.

The silver jubilee banquet, cele-
brating the organization’s 25th anni-
versary in April, will be one of the
topics for discussion. Plans will be
ma.de for student Industrial Day,
when young women who are in the
business world visit the campus and
attend classes.

It has been decided that the West-

How may coeds revive their “winter
weary” wardrobes? The latest edi-
tion of the Fashion Reporter, the bi-
monthly publication of the Retail Re-

search Bureau of the University, tells
that a crisp white pique collar or
vestee, dainty nosegays, colorful ker-
chiefs, and mannish Waistcoats will
make any costume fresh looking.
New styles in accessories have been
prompted by the Gay Nineties period.
Frilly jabots that help to feminize
tailored costumes, dainty nosegays of
flowers, vegetables, and fruit, and
the increasingly popular pastel doe-
skin gloves were inﬂuenced by this
period.

Fashions Spurn. Winter, Show New
Accessories That Breathe Of Spring

National inﬂuences in our fashions
may be seen in the borrowing of
striped scarfs, bangle jewelry, tassels,
braids, and fringe from the Spanish.
The Chinese gave us charm bracelets,
vivid colors and prints, and the em-
broidered motifs that will be seen on
dresses and blouses. From the Mexi-
can and Tyrolean peasant we got our
idea for lacing on belts, bandana bags,
and colorful kerchiefs.

Fashion designers have even gone
so far as to copy from the men's de-
signs for our coed’s new fashions.
Fob watches, tailored shirts, waist-
coats, smooth belts, and brief case
hand bags all show the mannish in-
ﬂuence in women’s clothing.

"Can you really talk through a wire?” people still asked
