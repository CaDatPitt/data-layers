Nationality rooms 
increased by one

By Mark R. Brown
Staff Writer

Last Sunday, Pitt dedicated the
first nationality room in 30 years.
The Israel Heritage Classroom is
now room 337 in the Cathedral
of Learning. / .

The room was blessed by
members of the Jewish clergy.
Joseph M. Katz, chairman of the
Israel Heritage Room Committee,
presented Pitt President Wesley
Posvar with an ornamental key’,
symbolizing the transfer of the
room from the comm_unity to the
university.

Upon completion’ of construc-
tion of the room, Katz said, ”The
symbols in the I 'ael Heritage
room reflect the culture of every
member of the Jewish communi-
ty._ We are proud to present this
gift to the University of
Pittsburgh.” - '

The Israel room, like the rest of
the nationality rooms, was fund-
ed by members of the local eth-
nic community. Twenty—one
years in the making,-the Israel
Heritage room is designedin the
style of first to sixth century A.D.
Israel. , .

Unique aspects of the Israel
Heritage room include a frieze,
which was carved from molds

‘ made at the site of the ancient
_ synagogue of Capernaum by the I

   

fseia of Galilee,‘ ‘This is ill?"

Capernaum. To secure the molds,

The Israel Museum also provid-
ed a seven-foot replica of a seg-
ment of the Dead «Sea Isaiah‘

in quality to the one displayed in
Jerusalem's Shrine of the Book.

The floor mosaic in the classroom . I A "

is identical to the one in thesixth

bols surrounding the Ark of

Maxine Bruhns, director of the

Nationality Rooms Program,'said, I ‘I I
”The cost of the Israel room is 5

unknown, as a lot of artifacts are
not in yet. Construction was ap-
proximately $230,000, and the
total cost hovers somewhere
around $350,000.

”Several designs for the room
failed over the last 21 years. We
also had problems when Israel
went to war during that same
time period [Six Day War, Yom

THE P|'|T NEWS, Wednesday, November 4, I987

 

WASHINGTON — The Rev.
Jerry Falwell said Tuesday he is
resigning as president of the
Moral Majority and will no
longer play an active role in
stumping for political candidates
or lobbying for causes of the reli-
gious right.

”I am now re-dedicating my

life to the preaching of the

gospel,” he said at a news con-
ference.

However, he said his views on
issues will remain well known
through his television ministry.

He said he continues to favor
Vice President George Bush for
president but will take no active
role in any campaign.

Falwell, 54, said he also would

be closely involved with Liberty.

University, which he founded
near his church in Lynchburg,
Va., a.nd with a developing pro-
gram to provide a national phone
number through which people in
crisis — pregnant teens, drug ad-
dicts and others —— could receive
counseling and other help.
Falwell, who founded the
Moral. Majority in 1979, said,

”Eight years is a long time.”
He said conservative Christians
have gotten used to being more
involved in politics and secular
issues in those eight years and
that he felt confident they would

stay involved.

He had told his followers near-
ly a year ago that he would be
limiting his role in the ministry.

”There’s no need now for Jer-
ry Falwell to walk point and be
the lightning rod,” he said.

”Sometimes you get tired of be-.

ing the lightning rod.”

bery, burglary and conspiracy,

Shrager said. /-

Former LaRouche aide testifies

By john King

Associated Press Writer

BOSTON — Lyndon LaRouche
and his top advisors believed a
Pennsylvania man hired as a
security consultant had CIA
sources who could provide valu-
able information to the political
extremist, a former LaRouche
aide testified Tuesday.

LaRouche and consultant Roy
Frankhauser frequently would ex-
change memos discussing pur-
ported intelligence information,
former LaRouche aide Charles
Tate testified at‘Frankhauser’s trial
on charges he helped cover up
credit card- and loan fraud by
LaRouche’s 1984 presidential
campaign.

. Frankhauser would frequently
brief members of LaRouche’s
security staff, using code names
such as the ”cookie farm,” the
”farm” and ”the agency” to
describe the CIA, Tate said.

Although LaRouche considered
Frankhauser a valuable infor-
mant, he frequently criticized
him for not getting more out of
his contacts, Tate said.

”Mr. LaRouche said Mr. Frank-
hauser had not done enough to
get the agency to pressure the
White House to provide him with
Secret Service protection for the
1984 presidential election,” Tate
said.

‘ ”Mr. LaRouche’s vocabulary is
rich with epithets and words con-
noting various acts of violence,”
Tate said, adding that he over-
heard LaRouche tell Frankhauser
’’unless he killed two FBI agents
he was a sodomist. He_ was rant-

ing and raving about the need to
obtain Secret Service protection.”

LaRouche, a conspiracy the-
orist who is seeking the 1988
Democratic presidential nomina-
tion, believes he is the target of
assassins.

LaRouche, six aides and five of
his political organizations are to
stand trial after Frankhauser, who
likely will be a witnessat the se-
cond trial. Six additional aides are
charged in the indictment. Three
are to be tried later, and three are
fugitives. --

Mr. LaRouche’s

vocabulary is rich with

epithets 
— Charles Tate
P 99

Tate, the first prosecution wit-
ness, spent much of his testimo-
ny detailing the hierarchy of the
LaRouche organization.

He also identified handwriting
in the notebooks of three top
LaRouche aides. The notebooks
contain numerous references to
orders allegedly given by Frank-
hauser instructing LaRouche
aides to destroy records and leave
the country to stymie a federal
grand jury investigation into the
alleged fraud.

Prosecutors and Frankhauser’s
attorney told the jury in opening
statements Monday that Frank-
hauser lied about having CIA
sources so he could impress
LaRouche.

Tate said Tuesday he doubted
that Frankhauser had CIA sources
but said he did not relay his-con-

    
     
   
       
    

_cerns to superiors. ”They don't

understand doubt,” he said.

Assistant US. Attorney John
Markham said he would com-
plete his questioning of Tate on
Wednesday, with cross-
examination by defense attorney
Owen Walker to follow.

After Tate, the government will
call as witnesses several victims
of the alleged credit card fraud,
Markham said. The LaRouche or-
ganizations are accused of getting
unauthorized cash advances on
the credit cards of people who
used them to buy materials from
the groups.

Frankhauser, 48, of Reading,
Pa., faces up to five years in pri-
son and a $250,000 fine if con-
victed of conspiring to obstruct
justice. He is a former Ku Kulx
Klan leader_and American Nazi
Party member convicted of sup-
plying dynamite used in a 1971
Michigan school bus bombing.

Tri-Si gs to sponsor sock hop

By Ugochi Oyoyo
Staff Writer

The Tri-Sigma sorority, along
with the Lambda Chi Alpha
fraternity, will spend Wednesday,
Nov. 11, with the children of
Western Pennsylvania's School
for Blind Children when they
sponsor a sock hop.

The children will be able to en-
joy healthy food, good music and
interaction with other members
of the community.

Jodie Fine, president of the
sorority, explained that their or-
ganization’s motto is ”Sigma
Serves Children,” and the sock
hop would ”give the children a
break from their everyday ac-
tivities.”

Fine said the dance has been a
tradition. ”An old [Tri-Sigma]
member's son died of polio. So
a fund was set up from which
money would be donated to the
building of play rooms and other
things for terminally ill children.

Some of this money would also
be used to help educate people
who can help terminally ill
children.”

Rose Ann DiCola, public infor-
mation officer at Western Penn-
sylvania's School for Blind
Children, said that approximate-
ly 50 children would attend the
function, ranging in age from 10
to 21 years.

Students to travel
with peace group

By Chih-Cheng Yen

Staff Writer

In the summer of 1988, stu-
dents and senior citizens from
North/Xmerica, calling them-
selves Soul Force, will travel to
Northern Ireland in the effort
of promoting peace.

Soul Force is a peace group
recently formed in Ottawa,
Canada. Its present member-
ship numbers at less than 50,

comprised mostly of profes—-

sionals in, Canada.

” A group of us were just sit-
ting around taking about
Ghandi’s philosophy. We
thought of taking this
phi|osophy_and putting it into
action,” said Barry Randall,
co—director of Soul Force. ”At
present, there are 47 wars go-
ing on. We decided on
Ireland. Some people thought
of Nicaragua and South Africa,
but we wanted to choose a
country that spoke English.
And it is a small conflict as in
relation to the Iran-Iraq war.”

Randall said that Soul
Force's aim is to encourage
the peaceful resolution of con-
flicts through persuasion, de-
bate, discussion, questioning,

public opinion and other non-
violent tactics. It also hopes to
act as a facilitator to end these
conflicts. In its statement of
purpose, Soul Force claims
that it will never take sides in
a conflict and neither will it
align itself with any country,
political party or a religion.
The name ”Soul Force” was

borrowed from Ghandi who -
defined it as ”the moral or‘

emotional strength of a group
of people with similar beliefs.”

Randall went on to say that
most of the responses for

volunteering have come from .

students and senior citizens.

”We started ‘out reading
Ghandi and liked his
philosophy,” said Randall.
”Than we found out that he
got his philosophy from Tol-
stoy.” Tolstoy, in his later life,
also advocated non-violence.

Soul Force is now receiving
applications from volunteers
who wish to work in Northern
Ireland for two-week periods.
Soul Force will pay for all ex-
penses, including airfare.
Volunteers, however, will not
be paid salaries. Interested stu-
dents should call Barry Ran-
dall at (613) 237-0424.

Swiss release key lran-Contra records to Walsh 

GENEVA, Switzerland — Swiss
bank records that would be a
central piece of evidence in any
criminal prosecution of principals
in the lran-Contra affair were
turned over to U.S. investigators
Tuesday, the office of indepen-

dent counsel Lawrence Walsh

announced.

The Swiss Ministry of Justice
supplied the records to Walsh's
investigators, who went to Swit-
zerland to get them.

The records, which concern ac-
counts controlled by former Air
Force Major General Richard V.
Secord, his partner, lranian—born
businessman Albert Hakim, and
arms dealer Manucher Ghorbani—
far, are one of the most important
pieces ofthe lran-Contra puzzle.

The records concern several ac-

counts ‘set up in 1985 and 1986'

by Secord, Hakim, Ghorbanifar,
fired National Security Council
staffer Oliver North and other in-
termediaries.

Secord, Hakim and Ghorbani-
far had challenged the release of
the records and, without them,
Walsh's office has been reluctant
to make a final decision on
whether to seek indictments in
the scandal.

The bank accounts involved in
the case include one under the

‘name of Lake Resources, a

Panama—based company con-
trolled by Secord. Investigators
have said the account was used
to channel funds from the Iran
arms sales to the Contras and that
North helped set up the Lake
Resources account.

I Under Swiss treaties, Switzer-
land supplies banking documents
to a legitimate criminal investiga-
tion. Lawyers for Secord, Hakim
and Ghorbanifar argued that the
American investigators were
looking into political offenses
rather than criminal ones and that
Switzerland should not provide
the documents. Switzerland's

highest court rejected those argu-

ments, however..

MANAGUA, Nicaragua -4 A

A foreign military officer who

lapan trade penalties

eliminated by Reagan

WASHINGTON —— President
Reagan will lift an additional $84
million in sanctions against
Japanese products based on a
government report that Japan has
stopped flooding world markets
with low—cost computer chips, his
spokesman said Tuesday.

The action ‘will likely come’ by
week's end, said Marlin Fitz-
water, the spokesman. In June,

Reagan lifted $51 million of the  J

$300 million in sanctions im-
posed last April.

Fitzwater said that $165 mil— A
lion in retaliatory tariffs will still’

be in place because Japan has not
given U.S. chip manufactures
sufficient access to its markets.

Reagan imposed the tariffs on T

Japanese televisions, power tools
and small computers after U.S.
officials determined that Japan
had violated a 1986 agreement
on semiconductor trade.

The commerce department
said Tuesday that Japan, which

earlier had ceased ’’dumping’’— ’
computer chips at bargain-,

basement prices“;

Art mirrors life in comedy and drama

By Susan Washburn

Entertainment Editor

For the second season, the
University of Pittsburgh Depart-
ment of Theatre Arts has chosen
to include a play that mirrors the
atmosphere in which it is
produced. Last year, it was Who's
Afraid of‘Virginia Woolf. in the
current season, the department
has chosen another play that
takes place in an academic set-

ting,.Educating Rita.

The character Rita is played by

 

Sting
 Nothing Like the Sun
A & M

When Sting’s new album, ..
Nothing Like The Sun, came out,
i was a bit fearful that it would be
another driveling album of Cryba-
by songs about political and eco-

nomic problems that don't

deserve to have songs written
about them. instead, Sting has
come out with an album chock-

Can ex-Policer Sting swing a second solo album?

Nona Gerard, whose characteri-
zation will fullfil a thesis require-
ment. The play was directed by
MFA candidate Rick VanNoy.
Also appearing in the production
is Alex Coleman, the head of
Pitt's graduate acting program.

The play is a touching come-

dy/drama that follows Rita's road
tovself-discovery. Starting out as
an uneducated beautician, she

enters college — a choice that.

changes her life.

While attending the university,

she meets Frank (played by Alex .

Coleman), a professor struggling
to comprehend this zany
hairdresser. Coleman plays a role
that is quite close to him; he is a
professor in reallife, too. He also
choreographed several scenes for
last summer's Shakespeare
Festival.

Nona Gerard is an actress with
numerous credits to her name.

With an undergraduate degree_

from Point Park College, she has
appeared in several productions
at Pitt and created the role of'Sis

for the Christian Arts Company's
production of I am the Brother of
Dragons.

Director Rick VanNoy brings
the two together on stage. He be-
lieves the significance of the play
is for Rita's quest not to be mere-
ly an effort of obtaining
knowledge but, rather, the stu-
dent should ”be able to apply this
wisdom to life.”

_ Educating Rita previews Nov.
6 through 8 and runs Nov. 11
through 22. A

full of pleasant songs about emo-
tions, almost.

Mostly, the songs seem to be
about loneliness and getting
away from it all. ”Be Still My
Broken Heart” is the archetypical

song about a lonely -man who’

tells himself not to rush too quick-
iy into a possible relationship lest
his heart be broken.

”An Englishman in New York”
isrperhaps one of the worst Sting
songs ever, next _to his last al-

bum’s ”We Work The Black
Seam Together.” Sting tries to
paint atportrait of an Englishman
who is ”trapped” in New York
and who is too ”mannered” for
American society.

If anything, the song conveys
all too well the stereotypical
stuffiness inherent in all English-
men, agmood which traps the
listener unfairly into a boring
song.

Sting, however, has once again
confused the real world with the
idealized Earth of his recording
studio. ”History Will Teach Us
Nothing,” while sounding
moderately pleasant, shows
Sting’s ignorance of what's actu-
ally going on in the world by as-
serting that if you ignore the past
you will be better off and that you
only need to know your ”human
rights,” something that has yet to
be defined. A

Perhaps if Sting wouldn't have
failed historyas a kid,. he would
have learned that ”he who fails
to learn from history is con-
demned to make the same mis-
takes of the past” to roughly
paraphrase. .

Sting’s best song, and one un-

doubtedly written to sell the al-

bum and ensure that ‘Sting earns

no venom

some money, is ”We’ll Be
Together.” Sting proves here that
he can actually write songs that
don't deplore things specifically.
”We’ll Be Together” is the catchy
upbeat song needed to get the
listener out of his slumpgthat the
end of the first side leaves him in.
”Straight To My Heart" keeps
the the mood going as_Sting sings
about how science will eventual-
ly try to categorize emotions and
be able to reproduce them
through chemicals. Fortunately
for Sting, he sees through this and
tries to get to the ”heart” of a
woman whom he loves.

”Little Wing” continues the
mellowness of the middle of side
two by easily flowing together
with ”Sister Moon.” The Jimi
Hendrix cover is done perfectly,
conveying the imagery of floating
excellently, while not trying to
copy any Hendrix guitar—work
that would have marred the song.

The album could easily have
been titled With a Little Help
From My Friends, as Sting solicits
the talents of Branford Marsalis,
Mark Knopfler and Andy Sum-
mersto help him out. Perhaps the
only real problem with the album

Ballet reaps
good fruit
of Pittsburgh

By Cathleen Karlsson
For The Pitt News

Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre con-
tinued its season at Benedum
Center with the performances of
three ballets Oct. 29 through
Nov. 1. included in their reper-

" toire were Serenade, Tabula Rasa

and Coursings — three diverse
approaches to the art of dance.
The program began with
Serenade, a lyrical ballet
choregraphed by the legendary
George Balanchine in 1934.
Serenade was the first ballet
choreographed by Balanchine in
the United States and has a
modern style of classical ballet
dancing worked into it. The piece
is set to Tchaikovsky's ”Serenade
for Strings,” one of the com-
poser’s most prominent works.
Perhaps the most impressive
aspects of Serenadewere the ‘var-
ious rippling effects and forma-
tion changes the dancers created.
if viewed from an upper—|eve|

seat, audience members could‘

observe the whole ambiance and
mood the choreography exhibit-
ed — constant change, without
leaving any emotions behind.

The second performance was
Tabula Rasa- — a modern concept
of dance, choreographed specif-
ically for the Pittsburgh Ballet
Theatre in 1985 by Ohad Naha-
rin. ”Tabuia Rasa” is a Latin term
meaning ”clean slate.” it is used
to describe the human being at
birth, not yet defined by ex-
periences.

Naharin stated, ”My work
originated in the possibility of
that philosophy  [but] it should
not really matter whether one
[knows of this philosophy] or not

[to comprehend the perfor-

mance].” After experiencing the

emotions created by the dancers ~

of this piece, it is obvious that Na-
harin’s choreography shows what
he set out to express. Tabula Rasa
is a moving piece, emphasizing
the emotions of ’’love, despera-
tion and survival.”

As a finale, Coursings,
choreographed by Pittsburgh
Ballet Theatre's Ballet Master
Rick McCullough, was per-
formed. It was a cross between
the classicism expressed in
Serenade and the sharper, more
contemporary movements of
Tabula Rasa. This piece was ef-
fective as a finale, blending the
two earlier ballet styles together.

McCullough said, ”When I
made this ballet, I drew upon my
own sense of movement  and
I did a lot of shapes and positions
that are not strictly classical

_ ballet.”

..forward motion. ;

The music for Serenade and
Coursings was performed by the
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre Orches-
tra, conducted by Ottavio De
Rosa. Although the music for
Tabula Rasa appeared‘ to be
provided by a tape, the acoustics
in Benedum Center did not
hinder the expressions of the per-
formance. All of the ballets were
received with much applause
from the audience, guaranteeing
that Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre's
season will continue in a strong,

THE PITT NEWS, wednesday,

Videoman prowls thedregsof another MTV—filled week  

By Nancy Quick
and John Young
Friends or foes?

I was nice last week. I allowed
Nancy the last word, allowed all
of you the last laugh.

. Not so, this week. I listened to
too much Alice Cooper in
celebration of Halloween and
had to conclude that there's no
more Mr. Nice Guy, no more Mr.
Clee—ee—ean.

Richard Marx — ”Shou|d’ve

Known Better”

Nancy: In this voyeuristic

. video, we all watch the married

object of Marx's desire walk
around his studio, pouting in the
shadows.

Cut to the flashback affair:
Marx watches her take her
clothes off, obviously seducing
him. They fall in love. He plays
his guitar for her in bed. Again,
he watches her disrobe, this time
in front ofa movie screen. In the
climax image, Marx takes her in
his arms, and they bring the
screen down to the floor with

How
Can You
Worship  

in Silence?

He entered the church and sat
in silence. In the encompassing
quiet, as the petty cares of the
day dropped away, he sought
to reach God directly. Another
seeker rose and spoke of love,
of human cruelty and injustice,
of Jesus, of other peacemakers,
of things she was deeply moved

munion with God. His mind
enfolded the words, and in the
following reverential stillness
his thoughts cleared, his con-
victions strengthened, his un-
derstanding deepened.

And afterwords, everyone

There was no creed, no priest
or minister, no prearranged or-
der of service. Every Quaker
meeting for worship is a quiet,
search for the peace of mind to
hear the message of that still
small voice within.

Do you, too, suspect that there
may be something of God
within every person -- includ-
ing you? If so, perhaps the be-
liefs of the Friends will be
useful to you. We have some

them. Cut to the movie projector

A crashing to the ground and to a

single gold band, falling among
the tangled film tape.

The song behind this video is
really pretty good. But the sym-
bolism is cheap. And the female
representation is annoying. Not
only is she the seducer, breaking
the sacred bond of marriage to in-
itiate the affair with Marx, she is
also the foresaken woman who
wants only to have Marx back,
now that he realizes he should’ve
known better.

It's too bad that a nice guy like
Marx has to get his heart broken
by an evil seductress. He'll know
better next time, I guess.

John: This song is ”pretty
good?!” ”Pretty good?!"

I swear I heard this tune I0
times before I found out it was ac-
tually Richard Marx and not Ken-
ny Loggins singing this lame
piece of drivel. Blech!

As for the video, it reminds me
of 97/2 Weeks. I liked 9V2 Weeks.
You probably wouldn't, Nancy.
And that's half the difference be-
tween us right there.

Bruce Springsteen — ”Bri|Iiant

Disguise”

Nancy: Videos are a lot like
commercials. Image after image
in rapid succession, attempting to
affect a subliminal reaction in the
viewer. Think of the number of_
songs you ’d never hear on the ra-
dio if it weren't for the visual aid
of MTV. Or the videos that have
nothing to do with the song.

That's what I dislike most
about videos.

And that's also what makes
Bruce's new video stand out as

0 Cart T all

a brilliant piece of film.

Like his ”Atlantic City” video,
a series of shots of the jersey
shore in which Bruce and the
band refused to appear, the new
video for ”Brilliant Disguise”
breaks every convention of the
video age.

Its a single shot. lust Bruce in

MILK QRaTe THeFT... a New FORM OF PeeR PR‘essURe  

   

Turning over the reigns, at long last

I received a few letters this
week (one of which you will see
_ momentarily), a short play and a
series of poems. The people
whose material you will be read-
ing today are now officially fa-
mous and official members of
The Naked City. Perhaps I'll draw
up membership certificates, or
maybe I'll just start handing out
gold stars. What do you think?

A letter

Dear Paul,

I read you pretty often in The
Pitt News, but I wouldn't say I'm
your greatest fan — nor am I your
worst critic. I just read the paper,
think and use the pages for some
slam-dunking. Yesterday, I was
wondering -what kind of people
would actually sit down and
write to you. At first I thought that
anyone who wrote to you had to
be a lonely basket-case. Either
that or they were just pissed
about something.

Well, I'm different. Your mail
comes from those who are hdme-
ly, hot-headed or horny. Perhaps
I best fit into the last category.
But, I just wanted to let you know
that I'd love to run around in Your
Naked City!

See ya!
Oreo in May

P.S. Why did you really put
those leaves in the paper? I think
you were trying to "hide some-
thing” about your Naked City!

(Maybe I’ll write again, it beats
studying for calculus!)

Thanks for your letter Oreo in
May. I'm at a loss for the mean-
ing of your signature, perhaps
you can explain it in your next
letter. Feel free to run through
The Naked City anytime, as hor-
ny people are welcome most
anywhere, ‘and we're no ex-
ception. _: V 3 : ‘

Psychology to blame in the market

 

El.I.ENl
  GOODMAN

In the week of the crash, Arthur _

Kane was not the only one in
America looking desperately for
a culprit. The demented man,
who walked into a Merrill Lynch
office in Florida with a six—shot
.357 Magnum in his briefcase,
blamed his own stockbrokers for
the debacle. But the shooting
didn't clear up the economic
mystery.
Who dunnit? What dunnit? A
\ cast of experts, not one of whom
predicted the crash, has spent the
past days playing detective. They
have produced a lineup of sus-

pects. The deficit dunnit. The .

computer dunnit. The interest
rates dunnit. The trade imbalance
dunnit. Somewhere, there's prob-

. ably a contrarian who. insists that

the miniskirt dunnit. _
But the best_and brightest of
those seekig clues have said it

but that's another matter al-

- together.

Let_me get something cleared
up right away. I'm not sorry about
what I've done. There isn't the
littlest bit of remorse trickling
through my psyche. I have
broken the law, I have commit-
ted crimes against my fellow hu-
mans, and I don't wish to_change.

The law, the place where poli-
ticians hang their hats when their
heads get too big, has never been

was "psychology" that killed the

«bull market. "This summer while

the market was rising,” remarked
John J. Phelan Jr., the man who
chairs‘ the New York Stock Ex-
change, "I'd never seen so many
antsy people in my life.''

In the days since Oct. 19, most
financial analysts have turned
psychoanalysts. The study of the
market has become a study of the
collective mind. A study of antsy-
ness. Have we gone from morn-
ing in America to the morning
after? From optimism to pessi-
mism about the future?

Traveling west last week while
the market was tumbling south,
I kept encountering perfect
strangers on airplanes who talked
freely, and with a good deal of
black humor, about how much
money they had lost. The veil of
privacy that normally surrounds
the subject was lifted. Money had
suddenly become a shared, pub-
lic property. .

I met no one who claimed
prescience. Only Donald Trump
obnoxiously gloated to the pub-
lic of his street smarts, his Wall
Street smarts. The man next to me
on a Northwest flight out of Min-
nesota was typical of the ironyl
heard. With self-deprecating wit,

he explained to me how he had ~

prudently kept out of the market
until exactly two weeks before

' the disaster.  ‘
At the same time, in all‘ my trav-"

els, I encountered no one who
was fundamentally surprised.

ridiculous. If I see a need to sub-

vert the law — because Ineed to I
. or because the state of things in_

general calls for it — ‘I do s_o
without regret. Someone has to.

We've created a huge system to -
_ ensure our collective safety from’
undesirables, and I like to apply .

Christian reasoning to that piece
of lumbering social architecture.
Christian reasoning has taught

’ me that evil is‘ necessary to the

understanding of good. I want
everyone to understand good as
well as they can.

But enough rationalization. I

break the law because I like to."

I revel in the heady excitement of

living outside the will of our

governmental oppressors.

whole -stack of them. ‘Orange
ones, gray ones, black ones and
even. a green one. I have them
stacked in a pile, collecting, dust
and books I've read.

Some of them are put to no use
at all. They merely wait, serving
as a gentle reminder that owner-
ship is nine-tenths of something.
I've had the habit for nearly six
years, six years of unabashedly

. hedonistic pleasure of subverting

the bovine juice empire.

It was easy to start. I saw one
lying among some cardboard
boxes, misplaced for its color in
the sea of brown. It looked lone-
ly. I took it, and my life hasn't

been the same since.

Shocked, yes, but surprised, no.
It was in the "psychology" of the
thing. Everyone more or less
thought it was coming. Maybe, in
a peculiar way, they thought they
had it coming. 

One traveling companion, who
had lost three years of profits in
eight days, put it this way: "I hate
losing money, but it was just
paper money, I never thought it
was real. I never really earned it.”

I don't want to put too much
stock in psychology at this vola-
tile moment. It's not good for the
portfolio. But along with the op-
timism that's part of the American
character, there is also a puritan-
ical streak, especially about
money. Especially about money
that hasn't been won by labor. To
Rosabeth Kanter, at the Harvard
Business School, "There has al-
ways been this psychological ten-
sion between Wall Street and
Main Street." It's one that exists
inside our own heads: a tension
between "honest hard work” and
"getting rich quick.”

To many, the market came to
look like an unseemly racetrack
frequented by a pin-striped
crowd of high-rolling gamblers.
Even those who were winning
weren't necessarily comfortable
with the crowd. Or the climate.
They kept an eye on the exit.

In the past few years, many of
the "haves" in this country have

‘cometo wonder if they "have"
it too easy. ,We have grown un-

comfortable 'with‘ the gap be-

enough -- I need more. There is
a strange peace in their presence,
much like an unread, unruffled
Sunday newspaper. There is a

feeling of safety in a milk crate.

I reason thus: should I have some-
thing I need to store, and I don't
have something in which to store
it, I begin feeling nervous. My life

feels cluttered. I steal for my

peace of ' mind (piece of my
mind?). I Q

But, alas, like the freedom to
ride a motorcycle with an unco-
vered head,_my vice is soon to be
curtailed. Someone in the legis-
lature has decided that I am a
menace, that I can no longer
practice my version of rebellion.
I can now be fined, I can be im-
prisoned, locked up and forgot-
ten for 90 days for the possession
of one of those plastic orange
delicacies. ,

And there doesn't appear to b
a way out. Stealing is wrong; en-

joying the act of stealing is cer-

tainly worse. I can't come up with
an argument to combat the law.
I haven't a logical leg to stand on.
That I enjoy the ownership of
milk crates, or that I enjoy the
stealing of them is not enough.

' Pleasure is never a valid argu- _
ment in the court system. The

reader is referred to the fights to

Lee Ritenour produced it,
utilizing an Atari STl040 com-
puter for the purpose of compos-
ing, arranging and structuring the
pieces. He composed most of the
album on the computer, using
Hybrid Arts software. Ritenour
also made use of a Takamine
acoustic guitar with MIDI in-
terface.

According to Ritenour, ”it ena-
bled me to write basslines, coun-
terlines, melody lines  to
orchestrate, by putting the MIDI
data into the computer. Once it
was stored, then I could alter it
any way I wanted to. It's like

, drawing a blueprint. Once the

piece is set, then I turn it loose

’ with the real guys in the studiO.”

Anative Of Los Angeles, born
in 1952, Ritenour began playing
the guitar at age six and began
formal lessons four years later. At

age 13, he studied with~Duke

Miller, who taught him technique
and theory in addition to turning
him On to the importance Of be-
ing a studio performer in Los
Angeles.

At ageVl6, Ritenour was play-
ing at popular LA clubs such as
The Baked Potato and Donte’s. In
1974, he played in Brazil on gigs
with Sergio Mendes. When he
returned to LA, Ritenour worked
in studios assisting on recordings
with such artists as Steely Dan,
Johnny Mathis and Diana Ross.

At the peak of his studio ses-
sion phase, Ritenour was playing
up to 20 gigs a week, compiling
almost 2,000 Sessions in only a
few years. Guitar Player maga-
zine awarded him ”Best Studio
Musician” for 1977 and I978.

He has at least 20 albums to his
credit here and in Japan, where
he is very popular.

By Michele Kiraly
Assistant Entertainment Editor
Those of you who look diligently

for an occasional photograph or illus-
tration to break up the copy in text-

books or even if you just enjoy-

reading comic strips, plan a visit to
the Carnegie Museum soon.

Why, you ask? The museum of art
is currently exhibiting a collection of
drawings by the master of French il-
lustration and portraiture, Maurice
Boutet de Monvel. The 19th century
artist is recognized as a progenitor of
modern book illustration, and his in-
fluence has been felt far into this
century.

Boutet de Monvel is credited with
the beautifully vivid pictorial biogra-
phy of the French patron, Joan of Arc.
The book, entitled /eanne d’Arc, was
completed in 1896 and is considered
one of the most important children's
books of all time. Several of the mag-
nificent watercolors from this book
are included in the exhibit.

Many of the drawings in the col-
lection were originally done for
another children's book, 5aint‘Nicho-
las. These works show children
eavesdropping on adults and en-
gaged in other diverse activities such
as fighting each other and visiting the
zoo.

The artist was originally a portrait
painter who often exhibited with the
Paris Salons. This continued until a
painting that dealt with a political
theme was rejected, thus causing
Boutet de Monvel_ to abandon the
mode. Hethen devoted his time to
develop his own style of portraiture
and illustration.

Much of the collected work is com-
posed entirely in pen and ink or
graphite. Severalpieces are painted
in watercolor. The work ranges from
the early 1880s to the early 1900s.

A graphite—on-paper work, entitled,
simply enough, ”Portrait of a Lady,”
is a faintly sketched composition of
a woman with a solid composure.
One notices carefully" drawn details,

like the character's wavy hair. This '

piece was done late in the artist's

career, around 1913.

The artist is widely recognized for
his portraits of children. Several

sons are exhibited. These works are
composed in watercolors, mainly
pastel shades, and date from the
18805.

Other works, such as a portrait of
a child from Chicago, is done in sub-
dued tones of ivory and pale blue. -
The child's blue eyes and white skin
match the colors of the wall paper in
the background.

”Mephistopheles” stands out with ,
its vibrant red and black hues. The
piece of 1878 features two figures,
probably of mythological origin, rid-
ing black stallions. This work marks ‘
the artist’s transition to the lighter
work of children's illustrations.

dren at the sea shore carrying woven

. baskets looking for none other. The

drawings are almost like caricatures,
with simple lines and not much de-
tail. The work is included in the book
Songs of France for the Little French.

A hilarious sequenceof pictures of
children at play is the subject of
”Story without Words,” a composi-
tion done with brush and pen and
ink. This series resembles present-day
comic strips such as ”Henry," in
which there are no words, and exag-
gerated expressions convey the ideas.

The works for ]eanne‘d’Arc are rich
and vibrant. They are by far the best
work  the exhLbit.

THE PITT NEWS

einer is more than just a collegeathlete

By Beth Froelich
Staff Writer 4

Recruiting is a tough guessing
game that coaches play.

A coach envisions an athlete
who will come into a program
and be all that a coach could ex-
pect a recruit to be —— _a leader,
excelling on the field as well as
in the classroom.

Once in a while, one such out-
standing recruit comes along, as
senior Bob Weiner did four years
ago for Pitt cross country and
track coach John Vasvary.

”What Weiner has done for
this team has shown much more
than in just meet results,” said

Vasvary. ”He is everything you
would like to see in a college ath-
lete. He is a fantastic athlete on
the field, a great student and a
real leader.

”Weiner gave the team assur-

ances when they needed them A

and acted to pull everyone
together when it counted,”- con-
tinued Vasvary.

”He. is one of our top runners,
and we will miss his athletic con-
tributions next year, but he has
contributed something more last-
ing to the program. The time he
has spent with the freshmen and

all that he has taught them is.

something that we will reap the

full benefits of in the coming"

. . :

years," Vasvary said.

Since the time Weiner entered
the Pitt running program as a
recruit from Mount Lebanon
High School, he has earnedtwo
All-America titles, helped lead
the men's track team to a nation-
al ranking, been a member of
Pitt's winning American 2-mile
relay team (which set the NCAA
collegiate meet record) and re-
cently lead the men's cross coun-
try team to a third-place finish at

the competitive Big East Champi-

onships.

Reflecting on the accomplish-
ments of the past four years,
Weiner feels he has come away
from the Pitt's program with a lot.

Wednesday, November4,1 1987* 

”You learn a lot, especially

' how to deal with the highs and

lows of athletic performance,”
said Weiner. ”This acceptance
carried over into my personal life,
too. I learned no matter how far
behind l was, whether in a‘ race
or with school work, never to get
discouraged.”

Although this is Weiner’s last

season, his work is hardly done.
Capitalizing off the momentum
gained from an eighth-place fin-
ish this season at the Big East
Cross Country Championships,
Weiner hopes to qualify for the
Olympic trials in the 1,500
meters.

”Qualifying for the Olympic

For junior wide receiver Bill
Osborn, playing at Rutgers this
weekend will give him an ad-
ded incentive. ‘

’’I played witha lot of guys
there,” said Osborn, referring.
to Rutgers players he played
against in high school. ”|’l|
have 50 to 60 friends and fa-
mily there. Everyone from my
hometown will be there, so
hopefully, I'll be ready to
play.’’

Osborn is just one of 14
Panther players who hail from
New Jersey. A ,

Osborn pulled a hip muscle
during last week's game
against Syracuse, but Pitt
coach Mike Gottfried feels Os-
born will get the chance to
play before his hometown
fans. -

”The doctor said he'll be
able to play.‘ He's a competi-
tor, and he'll be there,” he
said. » ~

”He’s a primary receiver
who always finds a way to get
open. He's competitive and
gives good leadership. He's
good at all of those things,"
Gottfried added.

Osborn almost didn't come
to Pitt, due in part to Rutgers
head coach Dick Anderson.
When Osborn was a senior at
Wildwood High School in
Wildwood Crest, N.J., Ander-

son was ‘an assistant coach at
Penn State and tried to recruit
him. .

”He sat down, with me and
said he was recruiting for Penn
State, but that he was up for
the Rutgers head coaching"
job... He was very honest with
me,” said Osborn.

Anderson called Osborn

gers head coaching job, ad-
ding if Osborn wanted to play
at Rutgers, he would give him
a full scholarship.‘

Osborn was already interest-
ed in Boston College, Penn
State and Pitt.

Needless to say, Osborn
decided on Pitt and doesn't
have any doubts onhis deci-
sion. ”l’m fortunate enough to‘
be a part of Pitt and have no
second thoughts about it,” he
said.

Osborn made his presence
known last year as a sopho-
more, leading the Panthers
with 33 receptions for 414
yards and three touchdowns.

Through eight games this
season, Osborn has 19 recep-
tions for 243 yards (13.1 yard
average) and two touchdowns,
but he had five receptions for
64 yards last week despite
playing less than three quart-
ers due to his injury.

ry because I hardly played in

Dickerson to starthis first collegiate game

By John Enright‘
Editor in Chief

Sal Genilla is out, and fresh-
man Darnell Dickerson is in 
Pitt's starting quarterback ~—- at
least for Saturday's game at Rut-
gers -- according to Pitt coach
Mike Gottfried.

Dickerson replaced Genilla, a
senior, on the last play of the first
half in last _Sa_turday's 24-10 loss

to Syracuse, andrheplayed them”

entire second half.

Gottfried said he made the
switch because the team needed
a spark, and although Dickerson
didn't lead Pitt (5-3) back to vic-
tory, he did inspire the team.

Dickerson drove the Panthers
74 yards for  touchdown on

their first possession of the se-‘

cond half, and Pitt had the ball in-
side Syracuse's 20-yard line on

two other occasions butgfalilehd to

"You could see how excited
everyone was when Darnell went
in. When wescored that touch-
down (‘a ?-yard pass from Dick-

could see it in Darnell jumping
up and down,” said Gottfried.

Dickerson completed eight of

touchdown and one interception.

Gottfried emphasized that he
was pleased with Genilla’s per-
formance but felt the team need-
ed a spark.

”[Darnell] doesn't care what '

the situation is. I saw that in him
in high school when he was play-
ing basketball  when it was
down to the last shot with 10 se-
conds left, he wanted the ball.
He's a take—charge guy. He has
that air about him — confi-
dence,” said Gottfried.

Added Gottfried, ”He can run

I like the wind. He gives you

another dimension when he goes
back to throw. Teams know he
might take off and runfln terms
of speed on our team, he has to
be in the top five.”

Pitt won't be the only team

.with a new quarterback this

Saturday.

Rutgers (5-3) lost to Vanderbilt
27-13 last week, and the Scarlet
Knights also lost their regular
quarterback. ,

Scott Erney went down with
damaged ligaments in his knee
and will be replaced by junior
John Murphy.

Murphy did see limited action

against Vanderbilt last week.
- ”We’re both playing guys who
came off the bench last week, so
I don't think there's an edge
either way,” said Gottfried.

PANTHER NOTES: Gottfried
said he's not concerned about the
bowl picture — a picture he still
sees his team in. While many feel
Pitt has to win its last three games
and finish 8-3 to garner post-
season action, Gottfried thinks a
7-4 record could land the Pan-
thers in a minor bowl.

Said Gottfried: ”The only thing
we have to worry about is Rut-
gers. lf you're meant for post-
season action, you'll go. If you're
not, you won’t.”

Cross Country Osborn

teams do well in
BigEast tourney

By Beth Froelich
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's and women’s
cross country teams exceeded
their expectations at this year's
Big East Cross Country Champi-
onships, by improving on their
performances of last year.

The men's team made a big
jump to a third-place finish this
year, up from a fifth-place finish
last year. While the young wom-
en’.s team, which finished eighth
at last season's Big East Champi-
onships, moved up to seventh
place. _

Pitt head cross country coaches
Jim Lear and John Vasvary en-
tered the championship meet
with high but realistic expecta-
tions for their teams.

”Coach Lear and I thought we
could finish well if we ran very

well,” said Vasvary. ”We did run’

well because even though some
of our runners had a bad day, the
others picked up the pace and
made up for it.

”Third place was a nice step
forward for the men's cross coun-
try team,” continued Vasvary.
”They are definitely heading in
the right direction. I think our per-
formance showed the rest of the
conference that the Pitt running
program is not just made up of
hurdlers and half—mi|ers.”

Nationally ranked Georgetown
captured the men's title with 33
points followed by nationally
ranked Providence with 61
points. Pitt finished with 85
points.

The Panther’s had two Top 10
finishes: senior Bob Weiner with

— eighth place and junior Joe

Daniels with 10th place.
Following the upperc|assmen’s

lead were strong freshmen Keith

Dowling and Craig Woshner,

V who took 16th and 24th place,

respectively.

Coach Vasvary was pleased
with the improved performances
‘of the freshmen throughout the
season.

’’It is a big adaptation that fresh-
men runners have to make com-
ing into a college program,” said
Vasvary. ”The race distance is
doubled from 5,000 meters to
10,000 meters. _ Dowling and
Woshner have made that adapta-

tion rather well. Both ran super
at the Big East Championships.
They show a little more maturity
and experience every time they
run a meet.” .

Finishing next for Pitt was
Waddie Freeman in 27th place,
Paul Friedrich in 42nd place and
Glenn Rhines in 50th place
overall.

The men's third-place finish
was good enough to qualify them
for the NCAA Championship
Qualifier meet to be held on
Nov. 14 at Lehigh University.

”We are going to the NCAA
qualifier with the outside chance
of making nationals. It's not total-
ly out of the realm,”said Vasvary.
We will have to run super well
though.

’’I think the Big East Champion-
ship was a bigboost for our
team,” continued Vasvary. ’’If
there was any question whether
our team could run with the best
of the Big East teams, the ques-
tion has been answered with a
very positive yes. I think our top
finish will give the team a lot of
confidence going into the NCAA
qualifier.”

Vasvary is equally pleased with
the performance of the women’s
team at the Big East Champion-
ship meet.

Pitt sophomore Robin Hubauer -

led the Lady Panthers with a
29th-place finish. Senior Debbie
Riley followed with a 40th—place
finish.

The Lady Panther’s began to
finish in a closer pack with fresh-
man Keisha Demas taking 43rd
place, followed closely by fresh-
man Cathleen Chrissos and
junior Gloria Azeke who finished
44th and 45th, respectively.

Vasvary is encouraged by the
women’s performance at the
championship.

”We are a very young team,
and I think our runners respond-
ed well to such a big meet,” said
Vasvary. ”The important thing is
that now we have the experience,
we need to move further ahead
next year. We will have seven out
of eight runners returning next
‘year. They will have more confi-
dence and will be able to help‘
the incoming freshman. All and
all, I think we had a great
season.”

Swim teams keep
Duquesneat bay

By Kelly Witt
Staffwriter

The Panther swim teams got
their seasons off to a- promising
start in an exhibition meet against
Duquesne on Friday night at
Trees Pool. _

Both the men's and women’s
teams dominated Duquesne,
which didn't win one event in the
entire meet.

Women's coach Dave Belo-
wich felt that his team had some
good swims but could have done
better if they'd had any compe-
tition.

”lt’s hard to keep focused and
keep pushing yourself when no
one’s next -to you,” Belowich

said.

Belowich was still happy with
the performance of his team. One
person he was particularly
pleased with is senior co—captain
Cindy Rose in the 50-yard
freestyle.

”She had a time of 25.0 sec-
onds. They took three consecu-
tive jumps off the blocks because
of fall starts, but when the time
came to get up and go, she did,
and she looked very good,” said
Belowich.

He was also pleased with Laure
Walczak’s and Terri Ziegler’s

swims of the 100- and 50-yard

freestyle. .

starting his first collegiate game,
he thinks the Panther receivers
will have to be alert.

”You have to go and do your
pattern, and hopefully he won't
have to scramble. Even if he

500-yard freestyle, Celeste Mak-
iel in the 200-yard freestyle, Liz
Sari in the 1,000-yard freestyle
and Kara Moxie — all through the
meet, I was very pleased with all
their performances,” said Be-
lowich. A

This season, the men's and
women's teams will have a lot
more meets together, and they
think that will help their morale.
”More meets have been sched-
uled together this year, and we're
more like one big team. We all
support each other. Swimming

. doesn't draw a whole lot of fans

as it is, so we really have to rely
on each other,” said sophomore
Terri Ziegler. ‘
The men's team also had a
good meet winning all the events.

The 100- and 200-yard
freestyle were both won by Bill
Folger with times of 48.3 and '
1247.2, respectively. Jim Emore,
Scott Jeffries and Chuck Lersch-
came in 2-3-4 in the 100, and
Geoff Rife and Steve Goth got se-
cond and third in the 200-yard
event

In the _ 1,000-yard freestyle,
sophomore Charlie Fry won with
atime of 9:45.08, and junior Dan
Langan came in second with a
10:08.00. This was Dan's best
swim so far at Pitt.

Jeffries was the winner of the
50-yard freestyle with a time of
21.6. Jeffries feels that the team

is doing well for early in the sea-
son. ’’I think that the meet was
pretty good overall. It gives us an
indication of where we are in the
season. Some people need to im-
prove, and some are right on
track,” Jeffries said.

Sophomore Tim Adams, who I

also swam the 50-yard free with
Jeffries, won the 100-yard back-
stroke.

Seniors Geoff Rife and Jody
Pfister swam the 200-yard butter-
fly. Rife won with a time of
2:03.36.

Mark Dombrowski won the
200-yard breastroke with John Ar-
kens coming in second.

Folger, Adams, Rob Monte and
Bob Smethy won the 400-yard
freestyle relay. According to
senior co—captain Chuck Lersch,
Smethy had a goodswim. ”Bob
Smethy had one of his best splits

in the relay. It is one of his best g

times," said Lersch.

Overall, the men's team is op-
timistic, despite the lack of in-
coming recruits this year. ”We

‘have great expectations for the

season," said Bill Folger.

Both the men's and women's
teams will be away this weekend.
They both swim at Syracuse on
Friday. On Saturday, the men will
take on Cornell while the wom-
en take on St. Bonaventure.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November 4, I987

Chargers making a run for the playoffs -

be his starting quarterback this
weekend against Kansas City?

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer

Table scraps from The Pitt
News sports desk:

0 Everybody is making a fuss
over the shockingly improved
play of the 6-1 San Diego Charg-
ers. So what, they've topped Kan-
sas City twice and squeaked by
St. Louis, Tampa Bay, the sliding
LA Raiders, Cincinnati
Cleveland. Six wins is six wins,
and the team's schedule doesn't
get much more difficult, aside
from tangles with Denver and
Seattle. Super Charger Dan Fouts
looks to be. making one last run
at the Super Bowl before calling
a fabulous career quits. -

0 Alas, the demise of the Lo
Angeles Rams is upon us. With
the recent trade of running back
Eric Dickerson to the Indy Colts,
there is nothing left to fear about
the team, except a few future
draft picks. The once highly rat-
ed pass defense is now fluttering
last in the league, QB Jim Everett
is having a difficult time adjust-
ing to coordinator Ernie Zam-
pese’s new offense, and the
whole attitude of the squad reaks
of dissension. Rumor has it that
the team's new fight song sounds
incredibly similar to ”Mary Had
a Little Lamb.” ~

0 Okla ”Wimp Schedule”
Homa continues to crush oppo-
nents. Saturday's 71-10 squeaker
against Kansas typifies the ludi-
crous method of madness that
Barry Switzer employs in insuring

andy

his team an annual major bowl

bid. At least Big Eight rival

Nebraska has been challenged by

the likes of UCLA, Arizona State

and South Carolina this season.

The two teams meet Nov. 21,

and I hope the Cornhuskers
pound the hell out of Switzer’s

Twizzler Eaters.

Temple beat Pitt this year. Tul-
sa beat Temple. Central Michigan
beat Tulsa. Ball State beat Central
Michigan. Fine. Now Pitt beat
Notre Dame this year. Notre
Dame beat Michigan, Michigan
State and Southern Cal. What is
proved by all this? An Owl—in—
hand is somewhat opposite and
equal to leprechauns_in the bush.

0 Speaking of the Panther foot-

ball team, chances of attending I "

any of the Edi-Bowls (i.e., Sugar,

PeaCh,.Orange, Florida Citrus, or 

if you're a boll weevil, the Cot-

ton) have finally been spoiled by =

0 The playful New York Giants
are 1-6, the worst start ever for a
defending Super Bowl champion.

0 Has Steeler coach Chuck

Saturday's loss to high—flying 

Syracuse. Now if there were a
Weevil Bowl 

0 Does anyone care that NBA
action starts up real soon?
Awww, Come on — there's usual-
ly one in every crowd.

0 The talented Cincinnati Ben-
gals are 2-5. It's now a foot-race
to the chopping block between
Cincy head Coach Sam Wyche
and Darryl Rogers, fearless lead-

‘er of the 1-6 Detroit Lions.

Wonder if Yankee manager-to—’
be-_or—not—to—be Billy Martin
studies nickle defenses and duel
tight end sets as his off-season
hobby?

   
 

 ~.: .

Has he finally realized that he is
currently the proud owner of the

worst starting QB in the Nation- -

al Football League? Finally?
