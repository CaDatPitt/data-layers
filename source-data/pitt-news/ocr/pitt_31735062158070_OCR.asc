Pep Rally Today in Memorial

Student Congress will announce
the winner ’of the Pitt—Penn
State poster ~contest today, ﬁfth

only to stir up enthusiasm for the
game, but to honor graduating
football lettermen,” said Paul
Petro, SC assemblies chairman.

According to Petro, each stu-
dent should try to meet the vari-

ous players and tell them he
is backing the team’s efforts. SC
will write person-al lettersto each

player congratulating him for the '

spirited efforts he has displayed
during the football season. .
Today’s- -rally will feature the

that class sponsorship would keep

The opinionof this meeting and
the SC meeting was that tradi-

years, but that ‘an initial break,
such as the one proposed, has to
be made. . _

The date of the Spring Dance

Freshmen Plan School Dance

As Landy‘ Enthusiasm Spreads

By CECY LINCOFF 9

Freshman men may sponsor
an all-school dance on Jan.

l 14. At their initial meeting on

Wednesday, frosh class offi-
cers set up a committee to
look into dance details.

Arnold Landy, class president
of business administration, was
named to head the committee. He
originally suggested that the class
sponsor a dance as their ﬁrst
project. ‘

Enthusiam ran high at the ﬁfth
hour meeting. Not only was the
dance idea unanimously accepted,
but another committee was de-
tailed to look into other possibil-
ities for class projects.

v Class‘ Treasury Suggested

‘Landy felt the leaders should

in “do something as class officers.”

It was suggested that a class
treasury might be started from
the proceeds of such functions.

Assistant to the Dean of Men;
Jack Hardman, orientated the
class officers as to their rela-
tionship to other student gov-
ernment organizations. He ex-
plained that the scope of MC,
S SC, and WSGA are to “exist as
bodies , to beneﬁt students and
administration.” ,

'He'added. “the student govern-
inﬂuence but have no
authority over the students.”

Student Groups Explained

I-Iardman went on to explain
the various “differences between
the structures of the three bodies
and their purposes.

A Brieﬂy, Hardman said that the
group before him has, if it stays
active in Men’s Conference, an

opportunity to evaluate, set up, _

and administer future conference
programs.
All of the oﬁficers attending the
meeting were very anxious to

 

learn of the differences in gover-

ning functions and structure of
the various student governing
bodies within the University. '
Review Given
A review of the past history of
the men’s class ‘oﬁicer program

was given by Hardman, as well
as its connection to Men’s Coun-

cil.

Repregenmﬂves at the meeting
included’ the ﬁve men elected
from their classes in the College,
business. administration, phar-
macy, and engineering.

Heading the committee to in-
vestigate other class projects is
Ed Lesser. His committee in-
cludes Fred Grossinger, Harold
Shapiro, and John I-Iusher. Dance
planning committee members are
Bernie Sobol, Bill Gannon, ‘Ells-
worth Bowser, Virgil -Rizzo, and

Reports have been coming in from Pennsylvania State ~
Universityfor the past three weeks in an ever increasing
ﬂow regarding that school’s feeling with regard to the_im-

“pending clash at Pitt Stadium tomorrow.

n “They"

By Joan Thomas’
When something is to be done people speak too
often in terms of “they.”' And “they” never does
come to the stage to unmask and bow as does the

phanthom of a mystery thriller when the velvet ~

curtains swing shut. after the last act.

And people very seldom form even one wrinkle
in their foreheads to consider who “they” 'migh
be. They just plod ignorantly ., ‘ ~.;
along, slipping problems on to
“they’s”, back as it sprints along
on thickly padded feet.

But perhaps 'when “they”
visits’ Pitt it becomes too ‘ex-
hausted to function, tired~iby the
long frequent moans of “I wish
‘they’ would do something about
it.” Maybe it _disgustedly joins« 
students‘ in comfortable 1oung— 
ing chairs, inhaling cigarettes’ over
"They" Slackingy ' .

At any rate, “they” does -not seem to be do-
ingits expected duties at Pitt. In exchange‘ for. 16
dollars a credit and sundry fees it seems that Pitt

o i was up in ym‘

By Irv R'othman
In a week Thanksgiving will be

here; respite from school work

and activity will certainly be
welcome. The vacation period

comes atea time when it behooves
take a

us all to settle down,
b r e a t h and
evaluate that
for which we
can be grate-
ful.

We live in a
world where
d i f f e r e nces
lend them-
selves to con-
troversy. Yet
our div e r s e
v i e w p o i nts
seem to create '

enough interest so that we want
to explore them more and ﬁnd
out the “whys.” Knowledge re-
sults—sometimes.

Forgive me for oversimplifying
matters. But it seems that this
troublesome age has been brought
about by small people on both
sides of the ocean who feel that
their way of life, their ideas are
‘best. Their only goal is "to get
others to see the li1ght———others
who may be Satisﬁed with their
existence; who may feel secure

‘under another government; who

feel that their countryiis pro-
gressing. »

Goals ‘ Include Others

Our eventual goals, however,‘

should not be to change others to
our way of life,,but rather to de-
velop an. appreciation and un-
derstanding of what they have to
offer. Americans who have the
perverted idea that a study of
languages is not -necessary in a

worldthat is learning theirs, have»;

lost half the battle across a con-
They’ve also lost
a valuable lesson in sematics, for
other languages often express
ideas more eloquently than we
do.  .

A few semesters ago, in one of
my classes, a student raised her
hand and fearfully said, “I read
where someday the yellow race
may ‘take over the whole world.”
The instructor replied, “If they
do a better job than we are do-
vin'g, I shouldn’t mind it at all.”
Others Blamed ,

In our efforts to attain success,
to mount obstacles which seem
paramount, we sometimes feel
thwarted by the elements—una—
voidable mites of men composed
from many races and many reli-
gions and many nationalities. For
our ‘failings we blame others; for
our rewards we give little credit

. to those who have helped. Con-

troversy results from differences.

i found more people than ive
ever seen before in that bi

they were all sitting down

a sort of platform and they
kept gett-ing up .

and talking and sitting
down again

two of them really had
‘something to say and they said

. it too

in fact i guess that they all
had some worth while

things to say but most of

them talked too long

but this one young guy and
this other older guy seemed to
know just what they had to say
and they really put it down

in verbs and nouns

i was rather confused in one

kept referring tothat big

proven. dire results for those who
lack ' consideration for -others.

Understanding Needed

Therefore an__understanding of . .

mores and iolkways is important.
Though We may thankthe good
Lord forbread ‘and water, for a
roof and for a ‘ government in
which we believe, I ‘think our
greatest thanks should be given
for our differences.‘ .

_Most collegiates have heard the
Bible story of the Tower, of
Babble. A king who had. con-
quered the world desired to con-

-quer even the spiritual powers.

His ziggurat rose higher than
any had ever before. Those he
ruled followed his everywhim

and under his lash staunch walls I

grew taller;

But (the story relates how God
transformed the unity into a con-
glomeration of languages and dis-
persed workers throughout the
globe—,that,neither a single per-
son nor a single ideal could ever
govern all minds again.

Instead we have many ideas, '

m..ny thoughts, many viewpoints
and _many standards. We should
be thankful.

Lions One Prerequisite:

Get Ready for Panthers

By JOEL MERENSTEIN
Many teams have been accused of looking forward to

next week’s game while

playing the one at hand, but when
_ even the coach participates in this preoccupation, then next

Week’s team must be pretty important.

In last week’s Rutgers game,¢

Penn State Coach_ Rip Engle re-
turned ‘Lenny Moore,°State _star
hurt earlier in the contest, to the
fray with the following explana-
tion: “Well, you see we play next
week and I wanted to be sure he
was okay.”
Engle wasn’t
kidding either;
His teams have
begun making
a habit of look-
forward to the
Pitt game and
, making it pay
elf.’ The past
t_wo seasons, ;
the Lions have 
accepted th e 3
victory from a
weak Rutgers
foe without though: and then
proceededthe following week to
outclaw the formidable Panthers.

This year the Nittany Cats are
looking forward ‘to triplicating

 

    

rig.

. that pattern. They havenot only

tamed the Panthers but have
trained them to stay away’ from

‘the goal line shutting them out

17-0 in Red Dawson’s two seasons

‘ here.

The last loss for the Staters to
a Pitt team was in 1951* when the

.,Panther’s present mentor, Tom

Hamilton, was guiding the Sky-
scraper U. team. That --13-7. loss
has been the only one inﬂicted on
a Rip Engle eleven by the Pitts.

The present version of the Lion .

attack is similar to that of the
1951 season with the ground

at Morgantown this afternoon.
-The Blue and Gold is anxious
to end the year’s festivities on a
winning note and nothing would
please‘them more than a victory
over their traditional rival.

Steve Petro’s squad, still ham- »

pered by injuries, is neverthe-

"less in its best condition since,

Still suffering from the lack of
an adequate aerial game, the 10-
cals will endeavor to spring their
hard-hitting backs loose. Counted
on to carry the burden of the of-

‘ fensive attack is a backﬁeld con-
. sisting of Dick Bowen at quarter-

back, Tony Capparelli and Bill Hill
at the halfback slots, and jarring
Chuck Abrachinsky at fullback.

“Abrachinsky, a rugged 200—pound

performer from Shenendoah has
been improving steadily and last
week rambled 16 yards for a Pan-
ther. score.
The Panther defensive line
took a terriﬂiq beating against
the Middies and Petro is hope-
ful they can regain the form
they displayed earlier in the sea-
son. . ‘ \
West Virginia has won four and
lost only one, that to a strong Cin-
cinnati team. The Mountaineers
enter the contest the favorites to

hand the Panthers their second i

Well, Jim, that’s what the lawyers call a leading

bined mechanical and electrical engineering course.
So I had what you might call a double reason for
wondering about my future with a chemical ﬁrm.
I soon learned. that the success of a large-scale
chemical process is vitally dependent upon mechan-
ical equipment. And the success of this mechanical
equipment——especially for a new process--depends
on (1) Research, (2) Development, (3) Plant Engi-

This Was
Quite a Season

By DAVE MAZER
Sports Editor

 

 

This sure has been a helluva year in football. Big things
were expected of this season’s gridders and while they have come
through to some extent, it is this coaching business that’s set every-
thing whirling.

Red Dawson, in particular, who never was real colorful coach
in the sense like some other mentors who are always popping off
to the press about their team, stepped into the spotlight and became
the most-talked°about personage in the grid situation.

After a vote of conﬁdence the second week of the season,
Dawson entered the hospital for observation of a heart ailment
the third week, and now he comes along ﬁve days before the big
clash with Penn State and bursts the bubble that he decided to
drop the grid sport before this fall’s games began. r

This last decision to quit was not surprising but the reason to
announce it last Tuesday was the unexpected. Dawson claimed he

was “being ‘kicked around” so it was time to talk back, but to this"

observer there’s something more to this incident.

What it is I don’t know, but one story that’s passed by here
says that Dawson announced it now with the season still on rather
than wait till next week at this time because he knew it wouldn’t
have the same effect after the ﬁreworks were all over, but‘would
sure surprise some people if it came out now. Who these
people were and what effect it“ would have on them were left to the
listener.

Anyhow, the coaching. job here is open for the umpteenth
time and speculation as to the new man is coming from all parts
of the country. New York reports Eddie Erdelatz from Navy,
Lincoln, Neb., says Biﬁ Glassford is coming back to Skyscraper U.,

and by tonight some other little
burg will clamor for attention
by announcing their candidate.

Personal opinion on this is
that the athletic committee will 
wait quite a while before doing
anything and that they will try
to choose a Panther alumnus. -
.Of course, it can be said that _:
they would naturally select a
Pitt man if possible, btit I think

Michelosen they might make a concentrated
push this time to secure someone who knows his way around here.

One possible prospect is Johnny Michelosen, at present the back-
ﬁeld coach. Although considered a single wing man because of his
background, Michelosen ._has ‘indicated that he can teach the T for-
mation because he did just that as a coach in the Navy during World
War II. '

But before picking next year’s coach, there’s still the.matter of
Penn State on this autumn’s list. And, a win for the comebacking
Panthers, who now stand at 4-4, would just make it a little bigger
plum to offer when the committee starts ‘reviewing the candidates.

Now that the football season is nearing a conclusion, '

several other intramural sports are coming into their own.
Among the new sports is handball. Any student or
faculty member interested in playing on an intramural
handball team should contact the‘

The ping-pong season also is

Proof of the fact that basketball
is here again is found in that
there will be a meeting for all

' entering the Intramural Basket-

ball League. The meeting will be
held on Thursday, December '2,
during fifth hour in the Cathedral
Gym. If a team manager cannot
attend, he should send another
representative in his place. Entry
blanks for teams will be provided
at this meeting.“

In the ﬁnals of football, Pi Kap-

As for the passing attack of
each team, the Lions and thrower

Don Bailey probably hold an
edge in this department in that
they have scored seven times via
the air route to the local’s foul‘.

Corny Salvaterra’s 33 per cent
completion average is nothing
phenominal but the Wilkes-Barre
sophomore has a strong running
game to his credit, having churn-
ed up 255 yards.

In the latest starting lineup
which Hamilton has indicated
will start tomorrow’s fray, three
major changes were made. Start-
ing at right end will be Junior
Fred Glatz, at center will be Bal-
lock, and Mc-Cabe is slated to be
back at the right halfback post.

Harriers in NCAA’s Monday
For 2nd Try at National Spot

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

After placing second in the IC4A’s in New York, Coach
Carl Olson’s deserving harriers will close another successful
campaign when they vie for the 16th annual NCAA cham-
pionship at the Michigan State College course in East Lan-
sing, Mich., Monday afternoon.

“If we’re able to get in the ﬁrst ﬁve, we will be real
lucky,” prophesized the veteran "mentor.

Confuses Readers;

Fight On for First-_

Maybe it was the closeness of
the air in the News oﬁice as they
made their selections but never-
theless, the result was that the
yogis made their ﬁnal choices of
the year with eight 3-2 charts
popping up. I 

Evidently they gave great

Fifth place, by the 'way, is:

where last year’s unbeaten squad
finished. And, with the loss of
five runners with tournament ex-
perience, the burden becomes
heavier on the shoulders of the
inexperienced sophmores.
Level Course Again

In addition, another flat course
confronts the hill and dalers from
Skyscraper U., one that on the
surface anyhow, appears to give
them the most ‘trouble.

“We’re not sprinters, we’re
cross-country runners,” stated the

' wily coach as he surveyed the

rolling ,four—mile course in the

Wolverine state.

The only returning ‘Panther
with any accountable NCAA ex-
perience is Captain Alan Gunder-
son who finished 24th in last
year’s tournament, behind winner
Wes Santee of Kansas.

Task Goes to Sophé

Thus the task of going after
the E. C. “Billy” Hayes travel-
ing trophy; which is awarded an-
nually_ to the winner of the team
title, falls on sophs Jack Schubert,
Jim Moore, Arnie Sowell, Thor-
ton Smith, and Tom Jessup, along
with the veteran campaigner, Bob
Cherry.

What with the return to sound

form of flashy Arnie Sowell, after l

a splendid effort to the IC4A’s,
the local’s chances of at least
duplicating ‘last year’s finish
appear to be somewhat improved.

In effect, a real battle for indi-
vidual honors seems inevitable
with the chief participants being
