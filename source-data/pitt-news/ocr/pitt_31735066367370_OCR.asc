New ‘Jimmy Proof’

Phone Plan Offered

Schenley House

‘ Council To Vote

011 Telephone Co. Suggestion
BY JACK SIVIITH

A plan will go before the Schenley House Council to-
night to accept or reject the telephone company‘s offer to in-
stall 10 “jimmy proof" telephones in the dormitory.

Should the Council, composed of ﬂoor presidents and
members of the house’s judiciary council, refuse the tele-
phone company’s offer, residents will be without the use of

Student Tickets
For Steel Bowl
Now Available

Students may obtain tickets for
the Steel Bowl Basketball Tour-
nament at the student desks in
the Cathedral and the Health Pro-
fessions Building today and to-
morrow.

The tournament will begin this
Friday with Pitt opposing Col-
gate, and Duquesne opposing Ten-
nessee. The winners will play
the following night for the first
place position. ’

University students will receive
only one ticket for either of the
two nights by presenting their
stamped invoices at these desks.
In attending the game, students
will not be permitted to enter the
student section unless they have
identiﬁcation along with the
ticket.

Any student desiring to attend
both nights may purchase reserve
tickets at $3, $2.25 or $1.50.

Last year the Panthers defeat-
ed Duquesne to capture their sec-
ond consecutive title. Duquesne
and Pitt are tied for the all-time
lead with three victories each.

Duquesne and Tennessee are
favored to win this year’s round
ball tourney.

On the other hand, if the coun-
cil decides to accept the offer, the
250 residents in Schenley Hall
will be required to pay the $30
installation charge, which will
come to about 13c per resident,
reports Jerry Whalen, head resi-
dent counsellor in Schenley.

The offer from the telephone
company came after an investi-
gation into the breaking of tele-
phone coin boxes.

“The response has been good by
students who have confessed to
making long distance «calls on
broken phones,” Whalen said. The
investigation, however, will con-
tinue. The telephone company

seemed appreciative of the Uni-
versity's cooperation.

Students need telephones but
we feel the University should
not have to carry the cost of
the installation. We hope that
if the council decides to accept
the telephone company's offer,
that the students will cooperate
in paying their share of the ex»
penses.” Whalen said.

Floor presidents will then be
required to collect the 13c from
each resident. No decision has
been reached as to what the coun-
cil will do to students who ac-
cording to Whale-n, “fail to meet
their obligation.”

To help in Campaign
For Reduced Rates

The University will be the first
of the five members of the Pitts-
burgh Intercollegiate Council to
present a questionaire to com-
muters in order to determine their
willingness to participate in a
program to obtain reduced rates
on public transportation.

The questionaire will be print-
ed this Wednesday in the Pitt
News. Dr. William Crafts, dean of
men, helped considerably in the

cording to Phil Williams, vice
president of SG and student rep-
resentative to the PIC council.
Williams emphasized the need
for all commuting studc-nts to co-
operate in this endeavor. He said,
“The success of this venture will
depend on the number of students
who fill out the qucstionaire and
deposit it in the boxes placed at

 various places on the campus.

He explained that because of
Vadministrative ditliculties, a few
of the schools would not be able
to participate at this time. “The
response to the questionaire at

Chatham, Carnegie Tech, Du-
quesne and Mount Mercy. Previ-
ous plans called for the Univer-

‘The (Sihild Buyer’

Dr. Calvin E. Gross, superin-
tendent of Tdttsburgh Public
Schools, will review “The Child
Buyer" by John Hersey this Wed-
nesday in the Fine Books Room
of the Book Center at 4:15 p.m.

“The Child Buyer” is an imag-
inary. record of the investigations
of the Committee on Education,
Welfare and Public Morality of
an unnamed state senate.

It is a commentary on some
aspects of American education,
on the uses of high intelligence,
and on the means of defending

democracy.

When George Washington was
a boy, his favorite foods were
beef and apple pie.’ The 1300
dormitory student; at Pitt have
proved that American eating
habits have not changed despite
the years’ pressures from gour-
mets.

According to the Saga Food
Company which provides food for
the University dormitories, the
five most popular food items are
milk, beef, potatoes, eggs and hot
dogs.

Religious Miracle

they present “The Miracle Play

and 17.

‘.‘The play is of a religious na-
ture and was probably presented
by the clergy of the middle’ ages,”
commented Colin Sterne, profes-
sor of music. “The Chapel with its
Gothic architecture and stained
glass windows is a perfect back-
ground for the play.”

“We have two purposes in pre-
senting the play-—entertainment
and education,” Sterne said.
“Most people today understand
very little about the middle ages.
The temper and philosophy of the
play is ‘simplicity and faith.”

The music for the play was
copied from photostats of the
original script in Orleans, France.
The notes had no rhythmical
value, and the poetry of the Latin
words had to be scanned for
rhythm patterns.

The story is about a little boy
who is kidnapped by a pagan king
and is restored to his home by a
miracle of St. Nicholas. A nar-
rator will describe the action, and
then the players will sing it in
Latin. The music was used during
the actual mass on St. Nicholas’
Day, Dec. 6.

The Players will use musical

THE SLOPES on which the engineering buildings are located have
been undergoing a face-lifting these past months. This retainer
wall, just recently completed, is part of the project of transforming
the colorless hill into a place of beauty.

U11-sightly Hillside Transformetl

I11to Beautiful Green Landscape

By AL JOHNSON

The once ugly, erosion-scared
hill side behind State Hall is now
slowly being transformed into a
“green paradise” shaded by hem-
locks and ﬂowering crabapple
trees.

Since February the University’s
buildings and grounds crew, un-
der the direction of Richard Barn-
hart,, who is the University’s
architectural engineer, has leveled
humps, ﬁlled in gullies, and re-
shaped slopes. p

What was once rocky, rain-
washed, barren soil on which even
weeds were afraid to grow is now
covered with a rich green coat of
Kentncky bluegrass mixed with
Penn dawn fescue and a small
percentage of other grasses to
give it added strength. _

Presently, the area which
runs from the foot-bridge
leading into the back “of State
Hall down to the sidewalk is
being ﬁlled in and walled up.
This little slope which once
served as a weather beaten
short-cut to the sidewalk below
will eventually be planted with
grass to match its counterpart
on the other side of the steps.

“Eventually, all of the area be-
tween State Hall and Alumni Hall
on the lower side of the walk will
undergo a complete face lifting,
making the area something Pitt
students can be proud to say is
part of their campus,” Barnhart
said. '

Since no extra help is added, no

not increased even though the

ly. .
This increased area in the last

ommuters Overlooked
*ln9Expans|or_1 Planning
Editor, The Pitt News:
oiﬂarely a week goes by in
which the local papers do not
carry an article on the acquisi-
tion of more land by the Uni-
versity. It may also be added
that a, substantial part of this
land will be used to construct
new dormitories upon, in which
out-.of-town students will live.
In all this expansion one
group is thoughtiessly overlook-
ed. This is the group of com-
muter students. With the acqui-
 of so much new land, and
with the commuter students
comprising a very large part of
the student body, it seems to me ‘
perfectly logical and reasonable
to ask the University to build
better parking facilities for the
corninuting students. _ .
The commuter‘ student is pay-
g just as high a tuition fee as
“the resident student, yet he is
reaping no beneﬁts from most of
the expansion.
It is true that the resident
students pay for their living
quarters, but this money goes
lmost entirely for maintenance '
of ‘the dormitories, not for the
construction of them.
» Someone will probably ~cQm-
{cent that a commuter student
can park at the new lot on.~O’-
Kara Street for forty cents a
day. However, this adds up to
about sixty dollars for two tri-
mesters, and this is to much for

Students Too Lazy
To Get Dressed Up

Editor, The Pitt News:
‘What is the matter with the
Pitt students? Are they too lazy

Most colleges have at least one
formal dance’ on campus -during
a semester, but the University
of Pittsburgh just discontinued
its last dance to which students
are requested to don tux and
gown. A , A

The Christmas Ball has always’
been my favorite campus event
these past two years, partly, I
think, because formal attire was
required. . . .

Now it is to become an in-
formal gathering such as Home-
coming. It is most disappointing
to me that at such a gala sea-
son the student body ﬁnds it
difficult to dress up.

Perhaps it is because of ﬁnal
week, and time will be taken
from studies to prepare for the
Ball. This reason sounds rather
foolish‘ when you consider that
the girls will spend almost as
much time on hair-do‘s, nails,
etc. as they. would for a formal,
and the boys may have to press
that good suit anyway. Besides
they did not have to rent a tux
many times this semester.

later she stands before the mirror, at stalwart ﬁgure
braced against the icy upswooping winds of winter.

With the tights smoothed along her legs, she
looks like an urchin just extracted from a mud

puddle. Taking long high stiff-legged steps‘ she
struts proudly once around the room_ and feels
with her hands, the ease with" which the cloth
stretches in the rear. 0

Now she vwraps on a tiny daisy-shaped plaid
skirt and slips into a yellow crew neck sweater.
’With cheerful determination she stalks over to her
dresser and sits down. After removing a handful
of bobby pins from her hair, shecarefully brushes
the tender globs of hair -into sweeping waves

leases the pressure and applies the same treatment

to the lashes of the other eye. Finished and T61 ‘

Pitt-— 1940 

. By Jim O'Brien

If one should care to take the time and energy
to wind the microﬁlm of the Pitt News of 1940 in
the Recordal machines in the school library, he
would uncover. some interesting bits of history
from that primitive era. »

These newspapers were printed two, decade
ago, yet their themes are re- '
hashed constantly and unknow-
ingly in the current editions of
this newspaper, yet still fresh.

Would you believe that stu-
dents didn’t have any school
spirit in that period? Well, the
editorials were thrashing the
apathetic students unmercifully
about ‘their stoic manner con-
cerning university activities.

Chancellor John G. Bowman
met with some resistance when
he proposed a $6,000,000 expansion plan. His dream
called for additional laboratories and research fa-
cilities for chemistry, engineering and-rmedicine.
He also wanted to build a student union, a ﬁeld
house, a skating rink and some more playing ﬁelds.

"He planned ‘to. increase the salaries of faculty
members who were ' earning less tmn $5,000 a
year. The present chancellor, Dr. Edward Lifeb-
ﬁeld, still encounters some of these same expansion
and budget problems. a i’
Steps Are Cleaner

In 1940 the Tuck Shop was on the eighth. floor.
It was overcrowded, and the student organizations
who loafed in the eatery were blasted for making
the dining place so dirty. Some of the students
even were regularly chased by the marshal] for
eating on the steps in preference to the designated
area. . '
A Socialist leader Norman Thomas spoke at the
Hotel Schenley that year too. This txzimester,
Thomas spoke to thestudentsiat the Midday Series

Now for the crucial moment of her whole pro,-'
cedure. She opens the drawer to her left, revealing
nine cans shaped like shoe polish containers. Her

the adventure, the mystery, the romance, the ex-

pastes a thick coat above and below each eyelid.

The WAA proposed intramural sports for co-eds"
that term. “They probably didn’t forsee the fact
that the girls would abandon their badminton rac- ;
quets one day and start tackling one another in 3

Forbes Field in a Powder Pu1f,Bowl.’

N V There was a’ big. parking problem ‘ too. Such, 
" drastic measures as constructing a parking lot
under the Cathedral were being proposed. The .i

students complained- loudly about the 2;-hour park-
ing limit directed at them in that year, but I

.wonder how they would react to the present strict ':

enforcement of 15-minute restrictions. There is
also a possibility in the near future that com-
muting students will be asked to leave their cars
at home.

AIESEC sponsors a unique
training program through which
American and- foreign students
are provided with the opportunity
to improve their knowledge of
actual business operations in each
other’s countries through a re-
ciprocal exchange of training po-
sitions.

The international AIESEC
program was established in
Europe in 1948 by student rep-
resentatives of 12 universities
in seven countries. Now active
at 198 universities in 24 coun-

tries throughout - the Western

world, AIESEC attained an ex-

change volume of almost 2700

students last year.

The local student committee
must solicit traineeship offers
from business ﬁrms in the Pitts-

Falenski, Maloney
Lead Cat Scorers,

Sager Gets 35

By JIM O’BRIEN

The city’s roundball en-
thusiasts responded to the at-
tractiveness of a marquis
highlighting a bargain bill
with the Panthers clashing
with arch-rival Army in the
opener, and the intra—city com-
petition between Duquesne and
Carnegie Tech.

Skyscraper U. disappointed a
heavily partisan gallery of 4,980
fans in bowing to the Black
Knights of the Hudson, 84-80. Af-
ter a see—saw first half in which
the score was deadlocked eight
times, the Cadets launched a full-
scale attack with _7:30 left before
intermission, and swished 11
points before the C‘ats responded
with a marker. They led 43-36 at
the half.

The Jungle Cats staged a" short-
lived rally at the start of the next

period, pulling within three points
on baskets by Ben Jinks and Paul
Lazor. Following in a distingush—
ed line of ﬁrst captains including
John J. Pershing and Douglas
MacArthur, Harold Hannon re-
fused to retreat under the high-
pressured uprising and directed
his forces to a 13 point lead at
61-48, adding three scores him-
self.

Dramatic Play
Timmons’ squad tried to re-
enact the dramatic play which
they had staged against Purdue,
but found Army a stronger antag-
onist. With less than a minute to
play the,Pan,thers bewildered all
present by c'a'1"itiously working for
a sure shot with the Lrecious time
dwindling. 1

They closed the gap to 82-78,
but 6’5” Lee Sager pumped in
his ﬁnal marker to ‘enhance his
high-scoring total to 35 for the

evening. Dick Falenski added a
ﬁnal basket, but the curtain had
already fallen. Falenski was
high man for the Panthers with
20 points.

The contest was decided at the
foul line where Army sunk 30 of
42., while the hosts converted 22
out of 32. The visitors were out-

ﬁeld.

Leads Experienced Squad

If there were a poll taken
at the University to find out
who was the best coach on the
Panther athletic staff, the an-

swer would have to be Rex
Peery, Cat wrestling coach.

Peery came to Pitt 12 years ago
and in his inaugural season he
complied a poor 0-10 record. This
was his only losing season. Next
year the matman climbed to 7-7
and the following year they were
on the winning trail with a 9-2
chart.

The Panthers under Peery have
an overall record of 88 wins 27
losses and two ties. They have
won the Easterns four times (last
year they ended up in a ﬁrst place
tie with Penn State), and ﬁnished
second once. The lowest the
Peerymen have ﬁnished in the
Easterns has been ﬁfth place in
their seven year tenure.

Never Won Nationals
A Peery?-coached team has never

 

ished second twice and third on
two other occasions.

Last year Peery probably
turned in his best coaching job.
The pre-season brochure had
this to say about the 1960 mat-
men, “Pitt’s wrestling team faces
a rugged nine meet schedule this
winter with the most inexperi-
enced material in the past eight
years.”

The result was a 7-1-1 record
with a first place tie in the East-
erns. They also boasted four un-
defeated wrestlers in dual meet
competition. 7

Undefeated Wrestlers

This year the matmen will not
be suffering from inexperience.
Dick Martin, Larry Lauchle, Daryl
Kelvington and John Zolikoif, last
year’s undefeated wrestlers, form
a strong nucleusfor 1961.

Bob Guzik will be around to
handle the heavyweight division

a game last season and was cited
as an honorable mention candi-
date for All-American, netted
only seven points.
John Fridley scored only
four points and was humilated
under the boards in the re-
bound department. “They beat
us on the boards,” Timmons ex-
plained. “Fridley’s timing was
way off. Fridley isn’t scoring
because he is not used to play-
ing against the big man. ‘
John Mills always played the

Jinks was erratic again and

Timmons said, “but he came on

more shakes at times and he
‘tightens’ up.”

“We have played all ‘ tough

Darling Honored
As Outstanding
Gymnast.

By LARRY HAGGERTY
Ever since gymnastics be-
came an intercollegiate sport

at Skyscraper U. some seven
years“ ago, the Blue and Gold

gymnasts of Coach Warren

Neiger have usually presented
a candidate or two for All-Amer-
ican consideration each season.
"Without a doubt the greatest
gymnast that Neiger has turned
out in his coaching career has
been Tom Darling. Darling won
All-American honors for two con-

secutive campaigns, 1958 and 1959,
for his feats on the ﬂying rings.
He captured both the EIGL and
NCAA ring titles during those two
years.

Besides Darling, other outstand-
ing Jungle Cat gymnasts of the
past ﬁve years have been Jim
Mulvihill, Dave Hirst. Don Neeld.
-Don Shima, John Cacolice and
Don Kasner.

The 1961. Panther gym team
also appears to have a candidate
for either Eastern or National
recognition, and‘ this would be
Earl McConnell who specializes
in tumbling and free exercise.
McConnell is a junior from
Pittsburgh’s Connelley Trade
School.

.McConnell had a very ﬁne dual
meet season last year, but had the
misfortune of being a double
bridesmaid in the Eastern cham-
pionships at Temple. He ﬁnished
second to Navy’s Joe Marshall, by
1/2 point, in tumbling and also
was runnerup to Greg 'Weiss, Penn
State’s outstanding star, in free

/ exercise.

Both Weiss and Marshall will be
on hand at the Easterns next
March at Navy and as Coach
Neiger stated recently, “I am quite
conﬁdent that Earl can reverse
both those decisions then.”

Ben Grady’s swimming team
held Eastern swimming suprem-
acy or ﬁve years, 1952 through
1956, but the Panthers will never
get an opportunity to own the
Eastern Crown again. The spon-
sors of the title meet have decided
to abandon the festival because of
conﬂicting tournaments in that
area which have cut participation
heavily in the past few years.

In its place they are holding the
ECAC Relays on December 17,
but the Cat mermen won’t be able
to compete because of. the up-
coming examinations. Instead,
they must be satisﬁed with im-
proving on last year’s poor 2-8
mark. '

The team is-“pretty- fair?’ ac-
cording to Grady. “Nobody is ex-

‘ Schmitt didn’t win a match last
year, his ﬁrst in wrestling. He
improved throughout the year and
Peery expects to see a winning
Schmitt out on the mat this year.

Harrison, called “Jungle Jim”
by his friends, should be one of
the best 157 pounders in Panther
history. Last year he -was uncle-
feated as a freshman. One time
he won two matches in one meet.

Shaffer will round out the team.
He too is a sophomore but will
have a rough time stepping into
the varsity position.

Grady Boasts

Balance for ’6l

Coach Ben Grady claims that
the 1960 edition of the Panther
swimming team will be stronger
than last year’s contingent be-
cause of a better balanced squad.

Last Winter Grady’s mermen
scored a second place ﬁnish in the
Eastern Collegiate championships
despite a poor 2-8 meet record.

For five years, 1952 through
1956, the Panther narrators held
Eastern supremacy. The next year
they slipped off the top spot, but
still managed .to ﬁnish second.

schedule any meets this month
because of the new trimester sys-
tem, but the team has been im-
proving in practice.”

“We don’t want to risk los-
ing anyone because of scholastic
diﬁiculties,” Grady added. “But
we’ll be ready for our opener.”

The opener poses a real stumb-
ling block for compiling a good
record. They inaugurate their
season schedule with a meet with
North Carolina State. The Wolf-
pack recently bested Maryland
59-39, and the Terrapins were
rated a solid outﬁt.

The only real deﬁciency in the
balance of the squad is that there
is a depth problem in the sprint-
ing department. Otherwise Grady
is conﬁdent that his men will in -

Hennon. Generalovich, on the
other hand, is a strong rebounder

with fine moves under the basket.
His scoring in the last two games
shows that he is handy at putting
the ball through the hoop.
“Generalovich is a good man ~ 
to have under the boards,” com- ’
mented Coach Bob Timmons.
“When he is working against the
varsity he gives them a lot of
trouble under there.”

“We could sure use him this
year on the varsity because of our
lack of board strength,” concluded‘
Timmons.

Coach Carl Peterson commented
on Sheﬂield, “He has the makings
of a real ﬁne basketball player.
He has some of the‘ moves that
Hennon had when he was a fresh-
man.”

The Panthers ﬁrst loss to Slip-
pery Rock was due to ﬁrst game
mistakes and the Cubs feel that
they can go the rest of the way
undefeated.

Whistlers' otr: This paintingby an unknown artis.

    

depicts the housemother of a college sorority patiently
waiting for a dance to break up in the next room. Note
how the artist has captured the anguish and devotion of
this lonely woman as she frets over her young charges
(who were nicknamed “The Whistlers" because of the
way in which they obtained dates).

The Venus de Milo: Sculp-
tured in the second cen-
tury B.C. on behalf of a
Greek-pencil manufac-
turer, this great statue
has won fame through
the ages as the symbol of
beauty parlors, bowling‘
alleys, upholstery firms
and reducing pills. Today
it is used primarily as a
vivid warning to small
children who bite their
fingernails.

The Thinker: What is The Thinker think-
ing? This has been as baffling to scholars
as the riddle of the sphinx and “Who's
on first?" But now it can be revealed
that this statue is actually a Roman

_ warrior who had been asked, “Remem-
ber how great cigarettes used to taste?"
when he failed to answer, “Luckies still
do," he was turned to stone.

 

Woman in Water: Here is the original
of a great "lost" masterpiece which
I was able to acquire for the ridi<_:u~
lously low price of $8,500. l mention
this only to show what great bargains
you can find in art if you know your
subject. I determined the authenticity
of this priceless original by proving
that the small stain, upper left, was
made by Renoir’s favorite coffee.

AT LEFT: “MASTER OF ALL MASTERPIECES"! “Here, in my opinion,"
says Dr. Frood. "is the greatest work of art. Note the bold, clean
strokes in LUCKY STRIKE, conveying the wisdom and pride of the
manufacturer. Note the perfect circle, representing. of course, the
perfect product inside. And in the product itself we ﬁnd a truly mag-
nificent expression of quality, good taste. pleasure and contentment.
Surely, there is no work of art that, over the years, has brought more
aesthetic joy not only go all of us in the art world, but to millions of
people in all walks of life."
