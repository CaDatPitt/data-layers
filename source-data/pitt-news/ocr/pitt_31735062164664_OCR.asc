 iiiiliicline Purchased by  
 University for Eng. Hill

The Duquesne Incline has been purchased by the Uni-

.3

versity in order to -facilitate the transportation of engineer-
ing students between Pennsylvania Hall, the Electrical En-
‘gineering building at the top of University Drive, and the
Fifth Ave. entrance of the Cathedral of Learning, announced

Lawrence Monnett, vice-chancellor of business affairs.
For the past few years, a group of Mt. Washington
residents have been putting forth a major effort to raise

sufficient funds to save the in-
cline and to keep it operational.
The managers of the Incline how-
ever, have claimed that it has de-
generated into little more than
a tourist attraction and a spot
for Boy Scout Troops to get a
view of the city.

In explaining the purchase of
the Incline for use on “Engineer-
ing Hill,” Monnett remarked,
“The Incline is a tradition that
is an integral part of the city
of Pittsburgh. T
0 “While the management of the
Incline is, correct in its assess-
ment of the Incline’s present ﬁ-
nancial position, they are shirk-
ing from their ‘duty as members
of the Pittsburgh business com-
munity in neglecting the cultural
and tourist value that remains in
the Incline. ‘

 “Our students have complain-

‘ about the long wait for buses

the gross inconvience and

, ort that results from.the long

walk up ‘Engineering Hill’ and
‘Cardiac Hill.’ Our ﬁrst concern
at the University is, naturally,
with the students.

“W_'hen the Incline was put on
the chopping block, we, the Uni-
versity as‘ part of the Pittsburgh
cultural community, felt that we
could perform a dual service by
purchasing the Incline.

“Not only will our students be
able to ride up the hillier areas
of the University campus in com-
fort, but parents of students and
other tourists will be able to see
and ride the Incline which has
long been a part of Pittsburgh’s
extensive cultural tradition.”

In reply to questions concern-
ing ﬁnancial arrangements, Mon-
net had a straightforward answer.
“It is actually very simple. We
will pay for the Incline with the
$50,000 a year which we will
save when we close down the
Allegheny Observatory.”

University Plans to Study Course
Discrimination, Advising Center

The University is reconsidering the efficacy of the current curriculum, announced 

Dr. Charles H. Peake, vice-chancellor in charge of academic disciplines, at a conference

last Wednesday.

,\A‘ committee composed of administrators _and professional students with a mimi-
um quality point average of 3.87 will be set up in 1968 to present a report at the 1969. 

Board of Trustees meeting, considering possible alterations for 1984.

The delay is due, explained Dr. Peake, “to the need to iron out certain administrative prob- 

lems, i.e. possible Student Government interference, for, after all, this is not its proper area.”

When asked as to what some ﬁndings of the committee might be, Peake answered: “Pd rather C 

not speculate, but I suspect that, among other things. the recommendations will be concerned with great-

er educational equality.

‘ i . “Some of the more glaring faults are: (1) intellectual discrimination resulting from the mul-
tiplicity of courses offered, (2) individual attention of some professors to their students, (3) the re- 
lations of the library to the curriculum. Also, (4) changes in the g ‘

Board Wants

Octamester
Chancellor Edward H. Litch

ﬁeld announced that the

Board of Trustees have

agreed to the adoption of
the octamester system at the
University starting the fall,
1965 term. ' -

“This new system allows the
student to complete his under-
graduate education in one year,”
said the Chancellor. Noting that
the tempo would probably in-
crease, Chancellor Litchﬁeld ad-
mitted that problems would arise.
One problem, he revealed, was
that there would only be four
hours before the end of classes
and ﬁnals.

“After all, our -main goal is

.applicability of the curriculum to the needs of the individual stu-

dents in context of the socio-economic pressures of modern society, ;: A
i.e. through a transformation of the Liberal Arts Advising Center.” . 

Explaining his second point, Dr. Peake stated that individual 5,,
instruction is not an efficient use of the professor’s time. “And mod-‘ 
ern techniques of management eﬁiciency have been disregarded toog _

long at the University.

When asked if he had any special courses in mind which might ‘ 
fall into these categories, Dr. Peake listed: History 114, 116, 120, 128, , -.
132, 134, .138, 156, 162, 166, 173, 180, and Speech 11 and 81 (“Argu-. "
mention” and “Speech in a Free Society,” respectively.) The Philo- 

sophy Department is also to_ take a large ‘loss.

Thirdly, Dr. Peake said that he found the “present system of ' '
information dissemination” (the University Library) “cumbersome 

and anachronistic.” Instead, he explained, he would prefer the es-
tablishment of a team of highly specialized experts backed up by
computers to man a booth in the Cathedral, The new system will be_
called QUIRC (Quasi—Uutra-Intelligent Relational Computers).

Lastly, the Liberal Arts Advising Center will slowly be phased" 

out and replaced by a set of computers programmed with the in-

dividual needs of the student. The loss of human relationships will ' 
be more than offset, according to Dr. Peake, by an increased grant  
to the History of Religion Department for use in their efforts to es»  '0

tablish a feeling of human totality in the students.

Commenting later in the day, James Watson, chairman of the_

The Ford Foundation withdrew a forty million dollar

“the main aim of the Founda-

The spokesman added that it

Vice Chancellor - of - ablutions

“The Langley Hall washrooms

“A theoretical entity is a

S. Tottle in his Philosophy
of Science lecture Saturday
night. Professor Tottle, who

currently holds the post of
Visiting Graduate Recitation
Instructor and Director of
the Westminster College
Center for the Philosophy of
Science, spoke on “Seductive No-
mological Explanation: The Sex
Life of Bare Particulars.”
Author of the best-selling ex-
pose of featherbedding, Philoso-
phical Problems of Waste and
Time, Professor Tottle also wrote
Everything’s Relative Anyhow:
The Significance of Einstein's
Physics for College Morality.
Professor Tottle said, “Epistem-
ic evidence tends to more-or-less
corroborate the probabilistic as-
sertion of counterfactuals as a
truth-functional system of modal
operators equivalent to .any deon-

. tic physical functor. At least cas-

ually,” he added with a chuckle.
He. employed partial differential
equations and Boolean algebra to
further clarify his point.

Then, for a moment of comic
relief, he quipped, “The hypothe-
tico-deductive account of aniso-
tropic universal predication-pros-
cesses for inductive theory-for
ma.tion, such that for all states
of affairs of both necessary and

Philosopher Lectures

Frequent bursts of applause
and appreciative laughter inter-
rupted Professor Tottle’s raptur-
ous monotone. He precipitated
cries of objection, however, by
his cybernetic dream-analysis of
Schrodinger’s solution to the free-
will problem.

“In short,” Tottle concluded
much later, “the thrust of my
argument stems from the self-
evident validity of p-horseshoe-q;
q; therefore p.”

In the question period follow-
ing the standing ovation, an
emaciated gentleman sitting at
the rear of the room stymied
Professor Tottle by demanding a
deﬁnition of “philosophy.” Then
the man came forward and en-
sured the 1ecturer’s Gotterdum-
efung by demonstrating Tottle’s
fallacies in an awesome display
of Mosaic and Nietzschean logics.

The well-attended lecture,
which ﬁlled the Irish Classroom
almost to capacity, was picketed
by a group of bearded students
representing Young Americans
for Fundamentalism and Escala-
tion (YAFE). Proceeds from 1_:'.1e
lecture went to a pension fund
for technologically unemployed
philosophers.

Athletic Publicity Direc-
tor Beano Cook ponders his
future in athletics this week
after Athletic Director
Frank Carver announced
four openings in the athletic
department. Cook has been
offered the positions of head
trainer, wrestling coach, fresh-

man football coach, and Dean of
Custodial Aﬁairs (janitor).

“Beano has extreme devotion
to the University,” said Carver
‘in a special release. “We can not
allow a man of such talents to
go unrewarded.”

Cook is known to his more
intimate Madison Avenue asso-
ciates as C. Hoff Cook, and has
gained national acclaim as the
playboy of public relations. He
also won honors as one of the
ten best-dressed men in the Orig-
inal Hot Dog Shop’s 1965 Fash-
ion Contest.

“With all my honors,” said 0.
Hoff, “I prefer to deliberate my
ﬁnal decision until all the facts
are available. I always do a thor-
ough investigation of a matter,
and follow the motto of the ath-
pletic department: When in doubt,
hesitate.”

Despite his hesitation, Cook ap-
pears to want the head trainer
position vacated by Frank Wie-
chec. “I’m leaning towards that
position, because of my expert
knowledge in anatomy,” said
Cook, chugging a stale glass of
Schlitz’s in Gustine’s dining hall.
“Of course, -I must brush-up on
the male aspect of the subject.”

Horse Czarnecki’s job as Dean
of Custodial Affairs ranks second

' with Cook. “It’s the prestige of

the job that I want,” he said.
“I’m basically a man of meager
means, and money is not essen-
tial to me,” said Cook as he
stoically downed another Schlitz’s.

“I've decided to let my phil-
anthropic side shine through, and
will even stop wearing my Brooks
Brothers wardrobe, if I could
have Horse’s job.”

. However, as the discussion con-
tinued and the beer ran freely,

-~C. Hoff became more eloquent.

“I really don't know what the
---11I want. I put in a 50
hour week at the dungeon (Field

,. House) now, and I’ve really been

physically exhaused.”

“Besides, my intellectual en-
deavors have been suffering since
I began working as PR man. I
feel I should let the school bene-

ﬁt from my intelligence, and may »
_ even run for Student Govern-

ment.”

Cook hesitated, then tears came
to his eyes and a lump formed
in his throat. “Give me another
Schlitz. I can’t stand it any
more,” he said. Fat Mary, the
rose of Gustine’s elite corp, fev-
erishly brought a supply of beer
and chips.

“The tension is just too‘ much,”
gulped Beano. “All these athletic
oﬁers, and not even one offer
from my hero, Eric Stern. I'd
gladly sacriﬁce everything and
become a beatnut, if only I could
join his following."

Hayes Comes Here

By RON SHEARER

Athletic Director Frank Carver
announced today the addition of
two transfer students to the track
squad.

Bob Hayes, world record hold-
er in the 100—yard dash, has de-
cided to complete his one remain-
ing year of eligibility here. Hayes
has already torn up his contract
with the Dallas Cowboys of the
NFL, and has promised to return
his bonus money so that he might
retain his amateur standing.

Three factors swayed Hayes’
decision to tr.ansfer. He wanted
to attend an Ivy League-type of
school, he wanted to test the tri-
mester system, and he was im-
pressed by the importance of the
track squad at the University.

The other addition to the track
squad is Valerie Brummel, So-
viet and world high-jump record
holder. Naturally the Soviets have
required that an exchange be
made for the services of Brum-
mel. The athletic department
must send them the blueprints
to the Fitzgerald Field House bas-
ketball court and Horse Czarnicki
to interpret them.

When questioned on the new;
acquisitions, track coach Carl
Rees said, ‘‘I think our record
may improve in the next year.
But these two must remember
that they must start at the bot-
tom just like the rest of my boys.
Therefore, I have decided to
make them co-captains for the
coming year.”
