A  Cold From :Moscow

VVherein The Writer
Worries About

By SIDNEY KALWARY
One of the;.world"S mysteries
 the source « of the . heavy
streain of gold that flows from
Russia. The volume is so great
that it has diisturbied those who
handle and buy the metal.

When they liave "asked where
it came from they have re-
celved the customary official ex-
planations, which means. that the
answers were such as only the
most credulous could believe.

RusSia’s Story  that new dis-
coveries and increased operations
in Siberia account for her 7,350,-
000 ounces in 1936 and her 10,350,-
000 ounces expected for this year.
Wherl it is considered that her
rate in 1932 was about 2,000,000
ounces it is no wonder the market
is curious.

Cold Sources

Wherever mining engineers ap-
ply mathematics to the situation
they break down the story that the
stuff is coming out of the ground,
either in quartz or in the easier
and more rapid placer. .

Natives of northwestern China
-have for centuries worked placer
mines in a primitive fashion, and
there is no record that they ever
did much with their gold except
shove it down in whatever they
-use for socks.

The Soviets have been taking
over that area in the last few
years, a fact which may have some
connection with the golden flow.
Another suspicion is that the gold
stored in Madrid at the outbreak
of war in Spain has been removed
through Russian channels.

All investigations, formal and
"informal, have revealed nothing
but puzzling and impractical in-
formation. Russia has the gold.
Where they got it, or where they
are getting it from remains un-
answered. Perhaps it is Russia’s
gold supply that is staving off a
European conflict for the present.

Possible Solutions

(1) Investigating engineers, ma-
thematicians, and scientists are
wrong in their calculations.

(2) Russia is receiving gold
from their allies. (Very unlikely,
for gold shipments are made pub-
lie.)

(3) Russian chemists have dis-
covered a method of transmuting
metal. (Transmuting baser metals
into gold was the dream of the
medieval alchemists.)

Editor’s Note: Would you sug-
gest an investigation by SFA, Mr.
Kalwary?

Panthers

Irish Tomorrow

Game W111 End

Pitt-Notre Dame

Grld Relations

Stomping into the midlands
of South Bend, Indiana, Pitt’s
football Panthers will face at
determining point in their 1937
gridiron campaign when they
confront Notre Dan1c’S_revivi-
ﬂed Fighting Irish tomorrow
afternoon on Rockne Field in one
of the nation’s headlined football
conflicts.

For the sixth time in as many
weeks the Rose Bowl rulers will
be matched against a team‘whose
season’s objective is to “Beat
Pitt.” When spring training be-
gan in Notre Dame last May,
Elmer Layden issued the Irish
Alamo. And since that time, the

Panther game has always been in
the back of the Irish mind.

PEP RALLY

This was evident, even in the
Minnesota-Notre Dame encounter
last week when the Laydenmen,
playing football of unexpected
proportions, stiﬁled the Gophers,
7-6. In doing this Notre Dame
used only a mimimum of offensive
stratagems. It scored early and
drifted in by hearty defensive
play.

This evening, on the South
Bend campus, there will be a gi-
gantic pep rally in typical Notre
Dame style. Tomorrow, Andy
Puplis will have Layden instruc-
tlons to shoot the works.

It all goes back to that bright
November afternoon last fall,
when the Panthers handed out the
most decisive drubbing a modern
Notre Dame has received, 26-0.
On that day the Panthers were in-
vincible, spurred by the spirit 0
self-vindication. 

PITT TEAM

While the personnel of the
Panther team has changed only
slightly, the play of this year’s
team while good enough to get
by, is not the same as it was at
that time.

The Panther has lumbered
around with a lethargic step, play-
ing good football, but not playing

the football that it seems to have,

latent. Incessant fumbling, con-
spicuous in the past three games,
has greatly hindered the team.

But, boys, this is November.
And that means this is the time
of the year when Pitt football
teams become ripe.sDefeat in No-
vember is as frequent to Suther-
land teams as a Republican vote
is in Allegheny County.

This game will be the ﬁnal
meeting between Pitt and Notre
Dame in a series that started in
1930 and has developed into one
of the juciest clashes on the au-
tumnal football bill. "

In the modern series, the Panth-
ers hold an advantage of 4-3. Pitt
lost the first two games held in
the days of Knute Rockne. In

Group Debates

Women debaters will meet
Thursday in the ﬁrst of a series
intramural debates. T h e
question for discussion will be,
“Resolved: That the several states
should adopt the unicameral leg-
islature.” ,

Florence Hiller, BA38, and
Sophie Nelson, Ed38, will uphold
the. argument. Margaret Byrne,
C39, and Lorraine Simpson, C39,
will present the negative" side.
Following the debate, the speak-
ers will be interrogated by other

AAA Advises

Routes To Game

Motorists traveling to South
. Bend tomorrow are advised
by the AAA "to take the follow-
ing route: U. S. 30 to Lisbon;
State 45 to Salem; State 14 to
Edinburg; State 18 to Nor-
walk; U. S. 20 to Fremont; U.
S. 6 to South Bend. This
route is recommended because
of the shorter detours. There
are no speed traps and the 369
miles may be covered in Very
good time. ,

An alternate route--U. S. 30
to Fort Wayne, State 2 to
South Bend-—-is 379 miles, with
slightly longer detours. Neither
route has bad roads at any

_point.

Health Service.
Sets Blood  
Test Deadline

Wasscrmann Tests
Not Given Free

After Wednesday

Deadline for taking the free
Vllassermaiin tests has been set
for Wrednesday, Novernber 10,
according to an announcement
from the student health serv-
ices.

“Men students will be given
the tests any time up to and
including this Wednesday,” said
Dr. H. C. Carlson, head, of the
men’s student health service, “but
beyond that, whatever tests are
given will be handled under our
former policy of paying $1.00 for
each test, the money to go to the
City laboratories for analysis.”

FACULTY INVITED

‘Dr. Auleene Jamison, head of
the women’s health service, said:
“The women will be permitted to
make appointments to take the
test up to Wednesday, even if the
appointments carry beyond that
day.”

A reiteration_ of the invitation
made to faculty members to take
the free Wassermann tests was
made by the health service, after
they received a poor faculty re-
sponse to the invitation in last
Wednesday's News.

All Wassermanns taken up to
Wednesday will be done free of
charge, the health services and
the City's Department of Public
Health cooperating with The Pitt
News in an effort to have every
student in the University take the
syphilis detection test.

RESPONSE OVERWHELMING

The student response to the
campaign has been overwhelming.
First week’s ﬁgures numbered 567
students, in spite of bad weather,
lack of test tubes at times, and
a late ﬁrst day start.

The second week of the cam-
paign has also been moving at a
better than 100-a-day clip. The
Tuesday report showed that 805
students had taken the test, and
the late Thursday report is ex-
pected to advance the figure close

to the thousand mark.

Dr. Reiser  
Discusses
Telepathy  

SFA F orum; ,  
Schedules s Third
Program Today

Analyzing current experi-
ments and attitudes on mental
telepathy, Dr. Oliver L. Reiser,
associate professor of -~ philoso-
phy, will address the third ses-
sion of SFA’s Student-Faculty
Forum today at 1. olclock in
24 Cathedral on “Extra-Sensory
Perception?” ' ~

According to the speaker, his
address will be an objective pres-
entation of recent attitude and dis-
cussion of experiments in the
field of thought transference. Dr.
Joseph Banks Rhine’s “New Fron-
tiers of the Mind” — will be re-
viewed. 7 '
RIIINE DISCUSSES PROBLEM

Dr. Rhine of Duke _"fUniversity,
formerly worked under Dr.’ Mc-
Dougall, noted behaviorist in the
field of psychology. His book, pub-
lished recently, discusses at length
the problems of extra-sensory per-

. ception.

Current experiments by means
of radio programs under the spon-
sorship of the University of Chi-
cago have helped to increase the
popularity of the controversy.

s Many scientists claim the theory

to be the result of the over-em-
phasis of coincidence:

Others take credence in mental
telepathy as a possibility, -and base
their assumption upon certain ex-
periments which have indicated a
greater frequency of “coincidence”
than pure chance would allow.

OPEN TO ALL

Dr. Reiser includes a question-
mark in the title of his address.
He will proceed-along psychologi-
cal and popular lines in his ana-
lysis.

The meeting will be open to all
students and faculty members at
the University, who will be invited
to join in an open forum discus-
sion following Dr. Reiser’s presen-
tation. The speaker will lead the
forum and will attempt to answer
questions.

Today’s assembly is the third in
the series of bi-weekly forums.
Previous speakers were Dr. Carrol
R. Daugherty, professor of econ-
omics, speaking on, “Current Labor
Problems;’’ and Philip C. Elliott,
associate professor of fine arts,
who discussed ‘.‘The International.”

C & G Grads

Choice of the Cap and Gown
script for the 1938 all-male mu-
sical comedy will be announced
November 22, according to Theo-
dore W. Biddle, assistant to the
dean of men and member of the

uscripts submitted by Leo Caf-
ferty, C38; Nick Spanos, C38; and
Bob Saffron, C38; and Bill Colker,
C39; and Stanley Markey, C39.

According to Mr. Biddle, all
other plans for the annual Show

deﬁnite has yet been decided on
the director, the date of the pro-
duction, or the theater to be used.

Free Tests Still Available

See The Lovely Pictures!

HOVVING currently at the Art Cinema is the

war ﬁlm, “Spanish Earth,” lately releas-

ed from l’ennsylvania’s Censor Board’s ban-
ning by Governor Earle.

The Pittsburgh Bulletin Index’s comment in
part says:

“Predominantly consisting of actual shots
of battle, its making entailed, the daily risk-
ing .-of its photogra.pher’s life, and as if to
prove the fact, in one scene two-thirds of the
‘actors’ are killed before the watchers -'
eyes.”

. By Robert Saffron
My freshman’ friend named Legion, he of the
gravel vbice, has been grumbling” about The News
not printing a “conservative” column. .
I can’t understand his oversight"; this corner IS
the most conservative The Pitt News has ever found
room for." Whenla f1‘eshn1ah tallies to talking like
that-—it hurts. A ' V '
Pe1*haps he doesn’t understand what a conserva-
tive is. According to my Webster dictionary, such
a person is one who wants to conserve, to preserve
what we have. I am thoroughly in favor of that.

I want to preserve private property; in fact I
want more of it. A few people are grabbing off
most of this country’s private property; we don’t
own our own homes, farms, tools any more. If the
institution of private ‘property is to be ‘preserved
we'll have to have a redistribution of the national
wealth and a fairer sharing of national income.

‘Preserve The Constitution’

i And if we must keep up the sham of free com-
petition, we may as well make the rules the same
for both sides, give the employee the right to organ-
ize as the employerhas done. Each man can’t call
signals for himself.

I want to preserve our national resources and our
business. If industries like coal mining and textiles
continue to exploit or cut the throats of (1) Amer-
ica's natural wealth. (2) their employees (3) them-
selves—-the government will be forced to take them
over to keep them and the country from going to
hell all together.-,7 '

The Constitution should be preserved, especially
the razzle-dazzle “due process” clause,’ which
means, "incidentally, that no person shall be sen-
tenced without ”a_ "fair. trial and conviction. It
ought: to bepreserved if onlyfor the sake of Tom
Mooney, the California radical who has wasted
away in prison for twenty years even "after the
judge! and prosecution "witnesses admitted perjury.

Opposes Propaganda

Also guaranteed are the rights of free speech and

’ assemblage; these amendments shouldbe recognized

as applying to gadﬂy groups like the American Stu-
dent Union. , . - . A
Like all true conservatives, I emphatically oppose

dissemination of propaganda by a governmental,

agency and control of education by VVashington.
That’s why I look askance at the ROTC, which is
taught by the war department, in material selected
by the war department—-over all of which the
separate universitieshave nothing to say.

It's time that the student body realized that The-

Pitt News is not run by subversive elements at all.
And if our radicals don’t like it——there are boats
leaving for Russia any day now.

A general liking for America, a particular liking-for the
Cathedral, and a mild but pleasant surprise at the fellowship of
‘Pitt students are the three’ things which have a.t.tra.cted Erich
Fisclieié, Swiss exchange student from the University of Zurich.
America, in Mr. Fischer’s mind, centers a.t present about
Pittsiburgh. Since he llaisispest 91112’ one night in NW 3’01'k City

"V “LIKES AMERICA ,
Mr. Fischer is 20 years old, and
is from the German section of
Switzerland. He’ attended six
years of what would be our pri-
mary school, six and a half years
of “gymnasium,” and thus far,
two years of university. Upon
completion of his work at the
University of Zurich, Erich will
receive his doctorate. '
"‘Pittsburgh,” Fischer says, “is
not nearly as dirty as I had been
told. New York seemed to have
far more smoke. Traffic conditions
here are bad, though, probably
because there are many more cars
here than in Switzerland.” Mr.
Fischer likes the new street cars.
American women appeal to Erich,
although he does not think they
should wear so much makeup.
The Americans spend far more
on clothes than do the Swiss, and
change styles every year, while a
Swiss dress of 1930 is still in
style today. '

ARMY TRAINING
.- Although Switzerland is noted
for its peace, it still believes in
military preparedness, and every
male must ‘spend at least six
months in the army, Fischer re-
vealed. After. “being discharged
he must also keep upehis military
practice. Switzerland,. never-
theless, is an ardent - believer in
Internationalism, as is~-proven by
her three official languages: Ger-
man, French, and -Italian.
Fischer expects to do little
skiing-this winter, for he is in-
terested in his work and prefers
to ski in the Alps. What little
time he has extra he spends in en-
joying America. and in improving
his gymnasium English by actual
practice. _ --

In its monthly summary of‘bus-

both in Pittsburgh and elsewhere
in the United States has failed to
show its usual fall expansion.

Noticeablecarly in September,
the industrial activity retrench-
ment which began moderately has
assumed severe reductions. The
large lead in automobile registra-

first six months of 1937 held over
the same period in 1936 has been
substantially reduced in the past
two months.

Stephen

By William Colker

 

Stephen Foster’s name has become so associated with the
idea of home or se.nt11'nent'al‘love that fit. is surprising to many
persons to learn that one of the composer’s most vital interests

was politics.

Although his political songs are of little signiﬁcance, his

activity in this ﬁeld forms an interesting episode in his life.
Everyone knows tliat‘ his Oh! Susanna was used by the Re-
publicans as their theme song last year in a vain attempt to put

Alf!Landon' in the White House.
A staunch Democrat like Foster
would have rolled over in his
grave if he had known that one
of his most popular works has
been used by the arch-enemies of
the Fosters’ the Republicans!
Hardly a presidential campaign
from 1865 to 1936 has failed to
make use of Foster’s music. Often,
both sides would «borrow his airs,
in the effort to defeat the other.
Thus we find Abraham Lincoln’s
backers singing the praises of the
Republicans to the tune of Old

Folks at Home, while their Dem-,

Hamilton, a friend of Foster’s, and
one‘ of the members of the Eu-

formed to sing Democratic cam-
paigri songs in Allegheny‘ County.

He states that more enthusiasm
was shown in Pittsburgh,‘ and Al-
legheny, perhaps, than in other
cities of their size in the "country.
Feeling between the adherents of
the different political bodies was
not altogether amicable and this
sometimes led to disastrous results.

Giant,” also with Old Folks at  there were few scraps between po-

Home.

The bitterness of the dispute be-
tween Hayes and Tilden over the
number of votes polled by each
was aggravated by Republicans
singing a stirring campaign song
to the melody of Old Black Joe——
the Democrats retalliating with
Ma.ssa’s in~de Cold Ground.

A CAMPAIGNER

Even the minor‘ political parties
used his songs and“ various de-
greesof the left wing organiza-
tions, ranging from a ‘dull pink to
a bright red, have borrowed Fos-
ter’s songs of home or fun in their
efforttov “build a brave new

world.” Socialists, communists, and

IWW’s have all made use of his
melodies. -

The 1856 campaign found Foster
and his family particularly inter-

ested. The Democratic candidate

was James Buchanan of Pennsyl-
vania, a brother-in-law of Foster’s
sister, Ann Eliza Foster Buchanan,
So their natural ardor as loyal
Democrats was increased by fam-
ily ties.

This campaign ‘ was bitterly
fought. The chief issue was the ex-
tension of slavery in the territor-
ies (rather than the abolition of
slavery, as some Democrats at-

tempted to make the Republican
platform read.)

An example of the intense feel-
ing during the campaign was re-

A AMEL’S use of choicer, costlier tobacccs has

The way smokers feel ‘gives the answer! Camels are

Harriers
Meet    
Penn State

S \_7arsity, Frosh
Run In ’ Two
Races Today

If mountain air is really as
beneficial as health resort experts
claim there should be a whale of
a good" cross country race at State
College, Pa. this afternoon when
the Panther varsity and freshmen
cross-country teams ‘chase the
State College varsity and fresh-
man harriers -all over Mount Nit-
tany. ’

’ Carl Olson, Carl Ulrey, and Her-
man Bearzi, coach, manager, and
trainer, respectively, and both the
freshman and varsity harrier
squads left last night for the
mountain school.

Olson took along Captain Al
Zamborsky, Ben and Casimir Ko-
pec, John Emens, Bob Cogswell,
and Bill McKee to make up his
varsity squad, while Nurmi, Bou-
langer, Ammerman, Sterner,
Standish, and Hahnel composed
the freshman squad.

TROUBLE EXPECTED

To date the Pitts have had com-
paratively easy going against their
first four opponents this year, but
they are anticipating plenty of
trouble when they come up against
the Lions this. afternoon.‘

Penn State can always be count-
ed upon’ to furnish stiff cross-
country competition. Coach Char-
ley Werner’s boysthis year make
up a traditional Lion harrier squad,
a hill and dale team that is plenty
tough for all comers. ’ S
, Leading the Lion pack is Cap-
tain Pete Olexy, who was defeat-
ed last week in a crosscountry
meet against Syracuse, the first
timethat he had been beaten in
an intercollegiate dual meet. Olexy
placed second last fall in the IC4A
cross country championships.

MANY SOPHOMORES

Supporting Olexy are Pearce,
Clark, Maule, Gordon and Tipton,
all hardened cross country veter-
ans, and a whole flock of sopho-
more stars who composed the
championship Penn State fresh-
man harrier squad last year.

A significant point that may
have some bearing upon the out-
come is the fact that the Penn
State veterans have been replaced
this year by the sophomores from
last year’s Lion yearling team. The
Penn State freshmen team last
year defeated the Panther first
year men who now compose the
greater part of Olson’s varsityhill
and dale outfit.

In a meet to be run. off before
the varsity run, the Pitt freshmen
will run against the Penn State
freshmen. This meet is expected
to be a_Very"close affair as both
the Panthers and Lions have un-
usually strong freshman cross
country teams.  ,.

Daddio’s legwas put on the bum.
Daddio played against Duquesiie
and Fordham, but the action did
him more harm than good. He
was withheld entirclyfrom the
Tech contest last week, and after
the game he__eiitere_d the hospital
for a 48-hour rest cure.

DADDIO OUT
Despite this careful rest, Dad-

kdio is not in good playing condi-

tion yet. Marshall Goldberg, the
other key man given a rest,
worked out with the team Wed-
nesday, and indications are that
he will be in the lineup at the
opening whistle.

Other injuries to turn up this
week affected Johnny Chickerneo
and Tony Matisi. Chickerneo has
a bad limp, caused by a bruised
kneecap, and Matisi was given a
severe jolt in the head last Satur- 3
day. It is C" reasonably certain,
however, that Matisi will be ready
to start Saturday. He has been
taking things easy this week. 

TWO GOOD ENDS '

Pitt’s lineup will show little
change tomorrow from that which
hasbeen used all during the sea-
son. Frank Soucliak, playing one
of ‘the greatest end games in the
nationitoday, wi].l be playing op-
posite Notre Dame’s Sweeney. The
meeting of these two brings back
memories , of _ the day when Joe
Donchess played opposite Wes
Fesler in the Pitt-Ohio State game.
The present two have yet to fully
prove All-American status. Satur--
day’s gamewill go a long way in
determining which will receive
the honor. _ -
Fabian Hoffman will be at Pitt’s
right end, with Paul. Shaw on
deck. The tackle positions will be
well cared for by stalwarts Matisi
and George Delich. The game will
be a sort of homecoming for Delich
whois a native of Gary. .

Don Hensley, almost fully re-
covered from the back injury he
sustained when the Badgers were

in town, will take over the center -

duties. Besides Don at guardsiwill
be Al Lezouski and Steve Petro,
both juniors.

Johnny Michelosen will be call-
ing the signals. At the halfback
posts will be Marshall Goldberg
and Curly Stebbins. Frank Pat-4
rick has been given official notice
that he will be at fullback. Pat-
rick, who hails from East Chicago,

Swill be the acting captain Satur-

day. — ., .

gineering are: the American So-
ciety of Civil Engineers, American
Society of Mechanical Engineers,
American Institute of Electrical
Engineers, American Institute of

in 319 Cathedral, Dr. Nita L. But-
Iler, professor of Latin at Pcnns: —

lprlsed her audience by prefacing
her speech with praise for the

Dr. }3utl»-er pronounced the tiles
the exact shade. of the famous
Pompeian tiles discovered in the

world’s most famous student of
the shades used in ancient tiles.

exciting career as a journalist. He
was a native of Martins Ferry,

iy and a member of Delta Sigma
Pi, which has since become Phi
Delta Theta. Before graduation
he joined the staff of the Tri-
state news bureau.

WAR CORRESPONDENT

During the World War he went
to France, and in 1918 jrined the
Associated Press. He covered the
French war office. and on Armist-
ice day interviewed Clemen-

of the Treaty of Versailles and
President Wilson’s attendance at
the peace conference.

In 1919 he went to Italy to cov-
2r the Red riots in Florence, and
when Gabriele D’Annunzio seized
«'.<‘iume for Italy, Morgan secretly
entered Flume by hiding under
:oal in a tender.
