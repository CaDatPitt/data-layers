Tucked into a small niche
on the first ﬂoor of the

Cathedral of Learning is a‘

room that is 155 years older
than the Cathedral itself.

The room was constructed
in 1781 in Damascas, Syria
and originally served as a
library and prayer room for a
wealthy Darnascan merchant.
It had to be torn down when
the French built a highway
through Damascas in the
1920s.

Instead of allowing it to be
destroyed, the room was dis-

~mant1ed piece by piece and

sold to a New York art dealer.
Pitt formed a Syria-
Lebanon Room Committee in
the 1930s, which determined
the room to be a great repre-
sentation of their culture. After
two years of bargaining, they
purchased it from the art deal-
er for less than $10,000,

reassembled it in the Cathedral

dedicated it on June 28, 1941.
Since then, only people on
guided tours of the Nationality
rooms have seen it.
Until this past Sunday.
The Syria—Lebanon room
was rededicated Sunday and
opened to the public eye via a
glass door that replaced the
original thick wooden door. It
will still only be entered by
guided tours, but anyone who

beauty and culture of the room

Half-percent tax increase
debated bylocal big-wigs

James Maude

Staff Writer

Oakland Thursday night witnessed
an oﬁicial debate on a hotly contested
local issue — the proposed 0.5—percent
regional sales—tax increase. The debate
was sponsored by the William Pitt
Debating Union and was held in David
Lawrence Hall's main auditorium.

Arguing in favor of adopting the
sales tax were Steve Greenberg, vice
president of communications for the
Pittsburgh Pirates, and Barbara McNees,
executive director of the Pittsburgh
Chamber of Commerce.

Arguing against the tax increase
were David Levansky, state representa-
tive for the 39th District (D-
Monongohela Valley), and Jerry Bower,
president of the Allegheny Institute.

The two sides criticized each others
contentions __ with supporters of the tax
saying its opponents were using scare
tactics, and those opposing the increase
saying that local taxes are high enough
already.

The issue —— which the aﬂirmative
called the “Regional Renaissance
Initiative” and the negative termed the
“stadium tax” —— will be decided in a ref-
erendum in 11. southwestern
Pennsylvania counties on Nov. 4.

During the ﬁrst stage of the debate,
each speaker gave a six—to—eight—minute
speech detailing his argument.

Greenberg criticized the opposition
to the "initiative" for placing emphasis on
the stadium construction.

"This is not a stadium tax; stadiums
are a part of the initiative," said
Greenberg.‘

He said that through this plan, the
region will generate an additional $1.3 to
$1.4 billion in personal income, and cre-
ate up to 30,000 jobs during the initia-
tive's tenure, refening to an independent
study carried out by economists at Pitt,
CMU, Duquesne and Price Waterhouse.
Greenberg challenged the opposition to
develop a plan instead of criticizing
theirs.

"We have a plan; they have no plan.

Pitt's chapter was the first one

To celebrate the organization's

Beth Lodderhose, the Pitt Lambda

rrrately 50 other Syrian and
Lebanese Americans from the
Pittsburgh area.

Antioch Orthodox,
Maronite and Muslim clerics
blessed the roorrr before a rib-
bon in front of the door was
cut, and the room was opened
up to everyone in attendance.

Pitt Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg escorted Chatah
and Al-Moualem into the
room first, for an informal
tour.

The small room’s intricate
18th century woodwork con-
sists of hand-carved linden-

chalked and glued and deli-
cately laiden with color.

A gray marble ﬂoor bor-
ders the brilliantly crafted car-
pet, along with the blue and
yellow striped satin-covered
sofas that line the walls of the
Danrascan room.

Gold vases and urns,
which sit on the shelves, help

highlight the beauty of the

room.

Al-Moualem said the
room is one of only a few like
it in the world. He said it
reﬂects the strength of the

Syrian people, who have been
through many years of oppres-
sion.

“The Syrian wood is
resisting [decomposition],” he
said. “It’s over 200 years old.”

Al-Moualem added that

the celebration “reﬂects that
Pittsburgh is famous for
bridges."

“We [Syria] are building
bridges to Pittsburgh,” Al-
Moualem said, refening to the
relationship between Syria and
Pittsburgh. .

Chatah agreed with Al-
Moualem's sentiments, adding
that the Lebanese people pride
themselves on culture.

He noted the room’s his-

torical impact on the past, pre-.

sent and future of the Lebanese
people. It shows the arts,
thoughts and expressions of
the region that have con-
tributed greatly to human civi-
lization.

Both Chatah and Al-
Moualem were in Pittsburgh
for the ﬁrst time and said they
were impressed with the cul-
tural diversity of the city.

Chatah added how
impressed he was with the
University.

“I would even consider
Pitt for my two sons,” Chatah
said.

result of the celebration, Lodderhose said,
every Lambda Sigma member was given
the chance to attend.

"We turned out with 100 [representa-
tives] coming in and 20 Pitt Lambda
Sigmas," Lodderhose said.

Lambda Sigma delegates came from
as far away as Massachusetts, Florida and
even Texas, according to Lodderhose.

After the delegates and advisers
arrived in Pittsburgh, they headed to the
William Pitt Union via shuttle to partici-
pate in icebreaker activities and work on a
service project. Participants made
Halloween treat bags for children at
numerous institutions in Oakland, includ-
ing hospitals and the School for the Blind.

hours in a van with bad music" to attend
this convention.

They enjoyed the initial icebreaker, in
which each person had to take off one
shoe, put it in a pile, pick up someone
else's, and find that shoe‘s owner.

"I expected this to be more awkward,
but the icebreakers helped me to meet
other people," said Estella, who is treasur-
er of his chapter.

Other delegates felt that this conven-
tion could expand their knowledge and
ideas about Lambda Sigma.

"I think it's a great opportunity to
share ideas from different chapters," said
Drew Pistilli, from Northern Illinois
University.

Commuting: the lesser of Iwo evils

James

 

Humans and computers:
Keep ‘em separated  

Researchers are now combining rat brain cells
with electronic computer chips in an effort to better
understand how animal brain cells communicate
and'process information. Some say this research
may lead to the eventual integration of electronic
and organic thinking technology. One day, they’ll
bring together our most advanced electronic com-
puting technology with nature’s masterpiece of
evolution, the human brain.

This is really stupid.

Why would anyone want to pollute computers
with human brains? Computers are so much faster,
so much more efficient at mathematical and logical
computations than brains generally are.

Computers know better than to do stupid things.
They don’t look at a watch, and a second later for-
get what time it is. They don’t forget someone’s
name as soon as they walk away from that person.
Computers never turn right when they meant to turn
left.

Humans, on the other hand, do all of those
things. We also forget our anniversaries and our
mothers’ birthdays. We say “yes” when we mean
“no.” We lie to ourselves. We lock our keys in our
cars. We stick our feet in our mouths (sometimes
we stick both feet in one mouth).

It seems ridiculous to think that adding organic
brain cells to electronic technology could possibly
improve it.

On the other hand, why would anybody want to
pollute his brain with a computer chip?

Can you honestly imagine electing to have a sil-
icon chip inserted in your brain? How fun could it
be to always know the probability of winning or
losing when you’re playing a friendly game of
cards? How enjoyable could music be when you’re
calculating the exact frequency of each note?
Would love make any sense to you if you’re con-
stantly analyzing the rate of your partner’s breath
to know if she’s aroused? And could you enjoy get-
ting drunk if you knew how stupid you really
looked?

It seems that humans and nature have indepen-
dently developed two pretty amazing technologies
that work incredibly, separately. Each is better suit-
ed than the other for certain tasks. Perhaps leaving
things that way would be a wise decision.

Maude
I’m going to be a bastard and

, steal an idea first brought up by a

fellow Pitt News reporter. While
she removes the hatchet from her
back and ﬁnally gets around to
ironing her sorority T-shirts, I’ll
answer her question: Why do
some students choose to live off-
campus?

I’m sure I can speak for
many off—carnpus freshmen here.
While resident freshmen are hav-
ing problems with stress,
cramped rooms and other oddi-
ties, our adjustment to the col-
lege process has been a lot easier.
I also saw how students live on
campus before I applied, and
somehow, I didn’t fancy living in
one of the AA-battery-shaped
towers, or any other residence
hall. The interiors don’t look
much better than the exteriors,
either. My French cat, Sterling,
said, “James, how can people
live in such a cramped area with
another person? Sacre bleu!
There’s not even space for a wine
rack!”

I’ve also heard numerous
roommate horror stories, like
roommates who feel the need to
invite 20 percent of Pitt’s female
undergraduates in the space of ,a
semester for a session of close
inspection and probing late into
the night. Then there are the
transsexual Satan worshippers,
backwoods child molesters,
“Star Trek” fans — there’s
always a risk one will end up
with a weirdo. Sterling com-
plained, “But what if I moved in
with someone who called a

croissant -a crescent roll and
thought chardonnay is Buick’s
newest-model car?”

And security is always an
issue. I’m from Joharmesburg,
South Africa, the city of choice
for muggers, murderers, rapists,
hijackers and hundreds of cate-
gories of criminal, so I should
not really be worried about life in
the comparatively safe neighbor-
hood of Oakland.
Sterling is a little paranoid. “I
don’t like the look of that Justin
DalMolin. He looks like the sort
of man who’d steal my litter
tray!”

And the meal plans. I’ve
heard complaints from students,
and I’m glad I don’t have to put
up with the meal plans. Sterling
criticizes Sodexho’s policy on
wine. “What!? No wine!” She’d
be concerned by the food as well.
“Hrnrn, I don’t think they’d be
able to make food the way I like
it; Iarns sauteed with garlic and
herbs, served in a white wine
sauce.” She is disgusted by the
fact that baguettes are rarely seen
in the cafeterias, and that
Sodexho doesn’t offer everyday
necessities, such as escargots and
french onion soup. But I’m sure
resident students don’t need a cat
to tell them that the food is not
quite up to scratch.

But living off-carnpus with
my parents is not ideal, either.
Choosing this option is choosing
the lesser of two evils.
Transportation is a key issue, and
a frustrating one at that. Public
transport or one’s own car?

Either way, especially com-
ing from the South Hills area,
getting to Pitt is a long, slow

THE PITT NEWS

I guess-

process. One can go by car, if
one feels like being stuck in a
half-mile-long tunnel for half an
hour every moming and evening.
PATransit is not exactly the trans-
porter of one’s dreams, either.
Fellow passengers are often
strange, outright weird, smelly,
psychotic medical assistants.
Some look like they belong in
the Russian urban slums of a
Dostoevsky novel. Others_ are
Pitt students wishing for an easi-
er way in.

Having been away at board-
ing school‘ for about half of my
high-school life, I have_not had
as much time living with my par-
ents as have had the majority of
entering freshmen. My father
runs the household like he runs a
corporate boardroom, and I
swear my mother is trying to
outdo Martha Stewart at every
turn. This irritates me to a small
degree at times, but I don’t feel
the urge to bludgeon my parents
to death as do other students I
know.

My parents let me do my
own thing anyway, but after two
years, I’ll consider moving out. I
don’t feel like earning a bache-
lor’s/master’s/doctorate while
living with them. This eagle
wants to ﬂy, and not look like a
pigeon doing it.

But for now, I’ll take advan-
tage of good food and a laundry
service, and learn to grin and
bear the disadvantages of staying.
at home.

James Maudeis warning to sex-
crazed bachelors: Living with
one’s parents can be considered
a form of contraception.

You oughta be

Ever have one of those weekends?

Sometimes, from Friday night to
Monday morning, things just don’t
seem to work out right. Plans fall
through, phone calls go unretumed
and sports pictures vanish.

Well, maybe you haven’t had one
of those exact weekends, but the only
people who had a worse stretch than
yours truly were the Rutgers defense,
Tony Fernandez and any poor
Philadelphia pickup artist who
thought, “Gee, with a million gals
walking around, I should have a great
chance!”

As that poor soul surely learned,
numbers can be deceiving. For exam-

' ple, if you score 55 points, you would

think the game was a bit of a blowout.
If your quarterback breaks yardage
and touchdown marks, you would
think that the team he captains was an
offensive juggernaut.

You’d be wrong. Very,
wrong.

The Pitt football Panthers won a
ball game Saturday, but they may have
lost some prestige in the eyes of the
at-large bowl committees and the rest
of the college-football community.
Walt Harris said after the contest that
the Knights were better than their 0-8
record suggests, but they aren’t as
good as the Panther defense made
them out to be.

A near disaster was averted, but
not even Pete Gonzalez’s record-set-
ting performance will be enough to
erase one simple fact: We almost lost
to Rutgers.

That’s not supposed to happen.
Not to a team with an outside chance
at the Liberty Bowl. Not to a team
with a “new attitude.”

Near—peril in Piscataway.

That was the headline on the front
of the sports section.

The picture on the front of the
sports section was a beautiful shot of
Jake Hoffart leaping over a Rutgers
defender to make one of his 12 amaz-
ing catches. If you would like to see

Two's cl charm for Panlhers

Brett Slmon

Staff Writer

The recurring theme for the
Panthers football game this past
Saturday at Rutgers was the number

two.

It took two receivers gaining over
100 yards, two single-game passing
records and two overtime periods to
beat the Scarlet Knights of Rutgers.

Not to mention the use of two tail-
backs in the backfield at the same time
during Saturday’s contest, the two more
wins that are needed for a Pitt bowl
birth and the return of two of the
Panthers’ top defensive players.

Oh, and as a result of the win this
weekend, Pitt stands tied for third in the
Big East standings at two and one.

“That was as wild as any game I’ve
been involved in. I wasn’t sure what
kind of attitude I’d have here because
of the ball game,” Harris said at

Monday’s press conference.

The positive tone of the news con-
ference was mildly surprising, consid-
ering it took two overtimes to defeat the
winless Scarlet Knights 55-48.

Rutgers. Gonzalez threw for 470 yards,

es for 155 yards and two touchdowns.

“Terry Murphy and Jake Hoffart
really stepped it up. The offensive line
really made it possible,” Harris said.

     

The offensive line allowed only one

sack on 42 pass attempts and paved the
way for 175 yards rushing.

The Pittsburgh Lady
closed out a
month-long road trip this
weekend by splitting
matches against West
Virginia and Kent State
Universities.

Friday night, the Lady

Panthers upended the Lady .

Mountaineers in the vol-
leyball version of the
Backyard Brawl 15-13, 15-
12,12-15 and 15-12. _

Freshmen Melissa
Alpers and Marcia Thiesen
led Pitt’s attack with a
match—high 16 kills apiece.
Thiesen also notched 22
digs. Jessica Van Der
Mallie had 13 kills while
Paula Zemrowski accumu-
lated 10.

Tara Haefner con-
trolled play with 57 assists

and'2O digs.

“We came up really
strong,” Head Coach Cindy
Alvear said. “Sometimes
you think you know what
you’re doing but during the
match you have to make
adjustments; and we were
able to do that.”

“We put Melissa
Alpers in the middle, and it
was a case of finding a
team's nemesis, something
that they just couldn’t stop.
It was a critical. part of the
win.”

West Virginia was led
by Brooke Hudson, with 13
kills, and Meghan Porter,
who had 12 kills and 13
digs.

On Sunday, Pittsburgh
traveled to Kent State and
lost to the host Golden
Flashes 6-16, 5-15, 15-3
and 11-15, thus falling to
11-9 on the year.

“We had a great warm-
up,” Alvear said, “but it
wasn’t a case of them start-
ing out very fast. We just
got off to such a slow
start.”

“In the third game we
switched up the lineup and
won [15-3], and we did the
same thing in game four
but just couldn’t find a way
to win. We don’t have a
dominant player like in the
past that can do things well
all the time. We’re still
very inexperienced at the
Division-I level.”

R o o m m a t e s
Zemrowski and Peggy
Meinhart led Pittsburgh
with 13 and 10 kills,
respectively. Tara Haefner
continued to play solid vol-
leyball, notching 42 of the
Lady Panthers’ 44 assists
and a team—high 15 digs.

The Golden Flashes,

who upped their mark to
15-9, got 14 kills from
Becky Neglia and 12 from
Jennifer Maibach. Nicole
Collias notched a match-
high 43 kills for Kent
State.

Pittsburgh returns
home this weekend to face
Providence Saturday and
Boston College, Sunday.
Both matches begin at 2
p.m., and Sunday’s match
marks the return of the
Athletics Department
Spirit Contests, in which
student groups attending
the game can win cash and
prizes.

“The girls don’t know
yet about the Spirit
Competition Sunday,” said
Coach Alvear, “but we’ll
let them know so they
understand the situation
when the match rolls
around.”

COLUMN

Even before the pictures, though,
the weekend was lovely. Working
backwards, we start with the
Cleveland Indians-Florida Marlins
Game 7 matchup. It was a great game,
and a great win for a former Pittsburgh
manager.

For a baseball traditionalist like
me, it was painful.

On one hand, there are the
Indians, a team that traditionally never
wins anything.

On the other, there are the
Marlins, a team that built itself on free
agency and ugly teal uniforms and, for
tradition’s sake, shouldn’t even exist.

So, to play it safe, I rooted for for-
mer Philadelphia Phillies (my home-
town team) who currently play for the
Marlins.

Jim Eisenreich had a chance to
win the game in the ninth and didn’t.
Then he walked in the 11th before the
game-winning hit. Darren Daulton
was already out of the game, after
reaching base on a three-base error for
his only Game 7 highlight.

Not exactly the storybook ending
I had originally hoped for.

The day before, I was careening
with the newspaper crew through
northern New Jersey, attempting to
navigate the swamp—bridge—swamp—
bridge—swamp—off-ramp terrain sur-
rounding Rutgers University. A series
of U—turns shaped more like Etch—a—
Sketch doodlings done by toddlers
finally led us to the game, which we
figured would be a blowout.

A short blowout. Not that we were
shirking our journalistic duty, mind
you, but driving eight hours, staying
in a motel with thin walls and loud
partiers, and getting carded in a
restaurant after the waitress already
gave us the beer menus (“Um, I’ll just
have a Diet Pepsi, thanks”) is enough
to tire anybody out.

Thanks to television time-outs,
tons of incomplete passes, and home-
coming activities, the game was
already almost four hours old with
five minutes to go in the fourth quar-
ter. As the clock ticked down, it
looked like the long ordeal for the
football team and its reporters was
almost over.

Two Brendan Edmonds drives
later, and we were in for about a half-
hour of bonus football. Figure in press
conferences, player interviews, and
discussions with the photographers
(not—very-productive discussions, in
retrospect), and we ended up in north-
ern New Jersey for a total of 43 years.

What a way to spend a weekend.
It’s a shame you couldn’t be there.

But we took some great pic-
tures....

PRESS CONFERENCE

Dwayne Schulters provided his
own fuel, igniting for 150 yards on 25
carries.

“Dwayne had a great game. He
really provided a spark,” Hanis noted.

Late in the second half, Schulters’
backup, Billy West, was called on to
play fullback for a winded Tony
Thompson.

“Billy West stepped in at fullback
at the end of the first half. He’s never
played that position before. I love citing
examples of unselﬁshness, and that’s
what we stress as a team. He really did
a great job,” said Harris.

Schulters shared Harris’ admira-
tion.

FROM PAGE 6

“Last year Billy West stepped in at
fullback, and he did it again this year.
Billy knows what to do,” Schulters
said.

Although the offense shined on
Saturday, the defense was almost
nonexistent as it allowed 48 points
against Rutgers.

“We have got to come together on
defense. Some guys still aren’t hitting
the holes. We have to dot our ‘i’s’ and
cross our ‘t’s,”’ Harris said.

The lack of defense wasn’t caused
by the absence of Rod Humphrey or
Frank Moore; both returned from
injuries to play in Saturday’s game.
This was Humphrey’s first action of the

7

season, after he was hurt in the presea-
son and had surgery.

Humphrey recorded eight tackles,
including one tackle for a loss, and one
sack. Moore added three tackles and
broke up one pass.

“I really don’t even know the score
of the game. You just have to give it
your best every p1ay,” Humphrey stat-
ed. Humphrey credited Strength Coach
Buddy Morris with his play on
Saturday.

“We call Coach Morris the ‘X’ fac-
tor. I think we work harder than any
other team,” Humphrey said.

Harris was impressed with the
team’s composure even though the
game was against a lackluster foe.

“I thought we showed a lot of heart
and poise,” Harris said.
