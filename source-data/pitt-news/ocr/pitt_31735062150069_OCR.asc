On the Constitution

Fraternities and Independents
buried the hatchet after last
spring’s rainy election day, but
they dug it up Wednesday eve-

ning at the SFA meeting and
swung it vigorously.

The immediate occasion for
the outburst was the reincarnation
of the “Hoeveler amendment,” de-
feated at the ﬁnal meeting of the
1939-40 assembly and providing for
the election of association oﬁicers by
the executive committee rather than
by the assembly.

Flare-Up Smoothed Over

Chief stated reason for the de-
feat of the amendment last spring
was that the new assembly should
be given the chance to decide rather
than have the proposed election sys-
tem put into effect by the outgoing
group.

Fred Robie, Ed41, Independent,
brought up the amendment under
old. business, and vice-president
Dave Tucker, C41, also Independent,
immediately moved its adoption. At
this point there was a slight tieup
while president Joe Roberts, BA41,
Phi Gamma Delta, suggested that
the boys were trying “to rush things
through,” but the matter was
smoothed over and the motion sec-
onded by Jack Brady, C42,

Half -hour Discussion

There ensued then a brief half
hour discussion on how the motion
should be considered and after fre-
quent references to various parts
of the constitution by several as-
sembly members, faculty members
Roy Umble and Theodore Biddle
(so far as is known, neither Fra-
ternity nor Independent) got to-
gether and pointed out that, under
the by-laws, the amendment would

‘have to be acted upon as a new pro-

posal.

This meant that the amendment
had to be discussed by the assem-
bly and either be rejected complete-
ly or be turned over to an investi-
gating committee for further study.
The next few minutes were occu-
pied by Independents, led by Tucker
and Robie, getting up and saying
nice things about the amendment,
and by Fraternity members, led by
Virginia Halen, C41, Theta Phi Al-
pha getting up and condemning the
proposal.

Defer Appointing

Eventually the assembly voted by
a better than two—thirds majority
to refer the matter to a special com-
mittee, appointment of which was
deferred by President Roberts un-
til the executive committee should
have a chance to meet.

Only other important develop-
ment at the meeting was. the suc-
cessful motion, entered by D. J.
Bailey, C42, that a block of tickets
for the Pitt-Duke game be trans-
ferred to the office of the dean of
men and made available only to stu-
dents. Robie then made a motion
which was passed, that Bailey head
a committee which would meet with
director of athletics James Hagan
and arrange for the transfer- of the
tickets from the stadium ticket of-
ﬁce.

Most important committee report
was that by Rae Young, BA41, who
announced that the Pitt-Tech goal
post trophy would be placed on the
plot of ground between State and
Thaw halls and that should Tech
win, there would be a 15-minute
presentation ceremony on the Mon-
day following the game. No action
will be taken in the event of a Pitt
victory.

By Anita Pat Barone

Last night in the Survey of Am-
erican Paintings, Carnegie Institute
took the lead in presenting an all-
American exhibition with paintings
from the early colonial periods up
through the present time.

The present survey marks the
ﬁrst occasion in which Carnegie
Institute has sponsored an “Ameri-
can Show” as its annual exhibition.
It replaces the Carnegie Interna-
tional which for the second. time
in its forty-four year history is sus-
pended because of a European war.

There are no prizes, as there were
in the International, for the major-
ity of the painters in this exhibit
are artists of the past.

The ﬁner arts committee of Car-
negie Institute, however, has set
aside a sum of $5,000 for the pur-
chase of paintings from the exhibi-
tion for their permanent collection.

The exhibit p-resents the most
comprehensive survey of paintings
by American artists ever assembled
in this country, covering as it does,
approximately 270 years of the na-
tion’s art history from the early
days of the colonies to the present.

It traces the development of Am-
erican painting from its ﬁrst prim-
itive works, based naturally on
European traditions, through the
various later inﬂuences, bo-th for-
eign and indigenous, to which it
was subjected, down to the ﬁnal
development of a native American
art.

Assuming special historical sig-

Institute Shows U S Paintings
To Replace Annual Exhibit

niﬁcance, the exhibition features
portraits of famous ﬁgures in the
early life of the Republic. Other
canvases include amsurvey in Am-
erican sidelights from beginning to
present.

The land itself, from Maine to
California and from Canada to the
Gulf of Mexico, its natural beau-
ties, its countrysides, its towns and
cities, furnish inspiration for anoth-
er large group of paintings.

Two distinct sections will divide
the retrospective paintings from the
contemporary paintings. The form-
er covers the work of deceased ar-
tists from colonial times to about
1920. The latter includes living arg-
tists active from 1900 to the pres,’-
ent.

Of the Pittsburgh artists repre-
sented in the contemporary show
there are: Virginia Cuthbert Elliot,
Clarence Carter, Everett Warner,
Malcolm Parcell, William Singer,
Jr., and Samuel Rosenberg.

Homer Saint-Gaudens, director
of ﬁne arts of Carnegie Institute,
who organized the survey spent
three months in visiting museums,
private collections, public institu-
tions, artists’ studios, and homes
with the intention of obtaining out-
standing examples of the work of
each artist represented in the ex-
hibition.

During the period of the Survey
of American Painting there will be
a series of Tuesday evening lectures
on subjects related to the material
contained in the exhibition. The
ﬁrst of these talks will be given by
Homer Saint-Gaudens on Tuesday,
October 29.

Panther Announces Winners
Of ‘Girls’ Nicknames’ Contest

S Beauty

Band Boys Break
From Boiled Collars

“Best thing that ever hit the
campus.” That is the opinion of
the Pitt band boys on the passing
of the old choker-neck ROTC
monkey suits! After much delay,
the new band uniforms were sched-
uled to make their initial appear-
ance last Saturday at the Pitt-
Fordham football game, but old
man weather thought different.

The days of red and itchy necks
are no mo-re as far as the Pitt
band is concerned. According to
Jim Hunter, BA42, assistant drum
major, the new uniforms “Are
the nuts.”

Players To Dance
In Gym Tomorrow

Instead of doing the entertaining
themselves, Pitt Players will be en-
tertained tomorrow night at an in-
formal dance in the Cathedral gym.

Members will dance to record-
ings from 9 till 12 o’clock. Bill Mc-
Elwain, C41,-president, and Louise
Smith, C41, vice president, will co-
chairman the affair.

Invitations have been sent to Pitt
Pl.ayers, but all others who are*in—
terested may come, according to
McElwain. Admission is 25 cents a
person.

Bureau Reports Sales

Increase this Year

Bureau of Business Research re-
ports that gross sales of department
stores in Pittsburgh for the week
ended October 19 were 8.5 per cent
greater than in the corresponding
week of 1939.

Coincident with the belated ar-
rival of the Panther, rumored to be
the campus humor magazine, win-
ners of the “What Do You Call Your
Girl” contest were announced to-
day.

Although men usually have girls
whom they may nickname, strange
(as are other portions of the Pan-
thers) is the fact that the ﬁrst prize
winner and two other winners in
the contest are women.

Phillis Weiner, C43, w'on ﬁrst prize
by submitting: “I call my girl Hinge
because she is something to- a-door.”
The second award was given to
Paul J. Glantz, C43.

Other prize winning slogans were:
“I call my girl Hitler because she
is sh-Nazi,” Daniel J. Mash, C43;
“I call my girl Calibre because she
is such a bore,” Jean Anderson,
C44; “I call my girl Sugar because
she melts right in my arms,” Helen
Harris, C43, and “I call my girl
Hash because she is a mystery to
me,” John A. Kelso, C42.

It is also rumored that the purpose
of the contest was to add some hu-
mor to the Panther.

Editor Frank Miller wrote .
“we’ve decided to go on calling our
girls by her right name.”

minister of commerce who is now
a refugee from his own native
land, will be the featured guest
at next Wednesday ’s Pitt Town
Meeting to be held in 244 Cathe-
dral at 1:30 o’clock.

This will be the second Town
Meeting of the week. A Monday
session in 244 Cathedral at 2:30
o’clock will be led by Lewis W. H.
Johnston, instructor in political sci-
ence, who will speak on “Evading
the Mud,” a discussion of evasions

law degree and a doctorate in poli-
tical science and economics played
an important role in French poli-
tics for twelve years prior to the
German occupation of his country.

He was a member of the Cham-
ber of Deputies, afterwards a
French delegate to various interna-
tional conferences, then the French
under—secretary of state, the min-
ister of aviation 1933-34 and 1936-
37, and ﬁnally he took the job which
he held until the defeat of his
country, as minister of commerce.

Dr. Cot taught political sci-
ence at the University of Rennes
and also taught at the School of
Law and Political Science.

Mr. Johnston, who will address
Monday’s Town Meeting, is a grad-
uate of Yale and is an authority on
the national political situation in
the University political science de-
partment. '

Both Town Meetings, under the
direction of Fred Robie, Ed41, and
Esther Marcuson, C41, will have
question periods at the end of each
talk so that the students might car-
ry on an informal discussion with
the speaker of the day.

St. Sava Medal
On Chancellor

Awarded to only one other
person in the United States, the
order of St. Sava II medal, high-
est‘ Yugoslav honor in the ﬁeld
of education, will be presented
to Dr. John G. Bowman, chan-
cellor of the University, at 4 o’clock
this afternoon in the chancellor’s of-
ﬁce.

His Excellency Constantin Fotitch,
royal minister of Yugoslavia to the
United States, will present the
award.

The medal will be given in recog-
nition of Dr. Bowman’s work in
connection with the nationality
rooms in the Cathedral and his in-
terest in all nationality groups in
western Pennsylvania.

Dr. Michael Pupin, professor of
physics, Columbia university, was
the only other person in the United
States to receive such an award.

Members of the Student-Faculty
association, the Senior Court, the
Board of Trustees, the Faculty coun-
cil, and the Yugoslav nationality
room committee will witness the
presentation in the chancellor’s of-
ﬁce.

“The award” explained Mrs.
Ruth Crawford Mitchell, advisor to
nationality room committees, “is
the European way of recognizing
distinguished work in the educa-
tion.al ﬁeld.”

Saint Sava was a great Slavic
educator who lived about 600 years
ago. He was one of the founders of
the Greek Orthodox church and did
much to advance the education of
central European countries.

Hull Will Lead

Drama Project

The Sunday Night Supper club
of the First Baptist church has an-
nounced its project groups for the
near future. Spahr Hull, teacher
at Perry High school and paciﬁst
leader, is in charge of the project
labeled dramatics.

The formation of a class, to edu-
cate paciﬁsts in the art of avoiding
conscription, recently brought Mr.
Hull into the news. It cost him his
position at Perry until he was re-
instated by Dr. Ben G. Graham, su-
perintendent of Pittsburgh schools,
upon affirming his loyalty to this
country. Thereupon the -class of
anti-conscriptionists which had been
scheduled to meet regularly at the
Jane Addams Peace center, was dis-
banded and told to take counsel
elsewhere.

The Supper club meeting at 6
o’clock Sunday evening, will fea-
ture a saxophone solo by Max Ad-
kins, leader of the Stanley theater
orchestra. Price of the dinner will
be 20 cents.

Sociologists Study
Rural Family Life

An opportunity to observe nature
at ﬁrst hand will be given to the
class in rural sociology, led by Dr.
David B. Rodgers, associate profes-
sor of sociology. Washington coun-
ty is this year’s choice for study.
Arrangements for the ﬁeld trip have
been made with the local authori-
ties and religious leaders.

Each member of the class will
spend the day in the home of a rural
family where he will observe
“country life.” In the evening, aft-
er comparing notes, the students
will summarize the rural situatinn

Easing the crowded condition of
the social calendar, the Undergrad-
uate Cap and Gown club and Pitt
Players will combine to give Pitt
students a chance to get more than
their money’s worth with a “Scotch
Weekend” November 8.

Presenting William Saroyan’s
“My Heart’s in the Highlands” in
Foster Memorial and a Highland
Fling in the Cathedral gym for a
combined admission price of only
$1.50 per couple, the two dramatic
groups claim to have the solution
to the problem of where college
students can ﬁnd entertainment on
a. budget.

“The weekend will be completely
Scotch,” Martin Schlesinger, C41,
chairman of the C&G dance, declar-
ed. “After the show there will be
the Fling and then the Pitt-Tech
game. Monday is Armistice day
and everyone can recuperate.”

Individual tickets for both the
dance, at $1 a couple, and the show,
at 50 cents a person, will be availa-
ble. Tickets for the dance can be
obtained from Cap and Gown club
members, and for the play from Pitt

Players. Both groups are selling
combined theater-dance tickets.

Survey Americana:
Another Milestone

Historic milestones in America have become as common and as
numerous as the proverbial ants at the proverbial Sunday picnic.

Famous last words, inaugural addresses, peace treaties-all
have gone down as separate turning points in the growth of our na-
tion.

Vvle should like to limit ourselves to a speciﬁc growth of mile-
stones

Cultural reaction has long been a hobby with the artistic set.
At the turn of the nineteenth century, American authors were de-
ploring the inability of native writers to create an original style
completely divorced from that of England and the continent.

In Concoul, a group of men got together. Later, one of them,
Henry David ’l‘l1oreau_. wrote a story about a pond. Simple, clearcut,
devoid of social signiﬁcance, beautiful.

Other ﬁelds came into their own. The visual arts grew. Paint-
ing took in the American scene. Sculpture blended with science,
and new techniques were born overnight. Architecture adapted it-
self to the principles of perpendicular structure, and the skyscraper
combined precisional beauty with utility and efficiency.

Our own Stephen Foster brought to the new land a collection of
folk songs. Gershwin stepped in, adapted the spiritual to a modern
mood, gave it meaning, gave up—to—date, sophisticated expression to
the blues, which were, in reality, only the polished version of every
love chant since boy first met and lost girl.

All this boi_ls down to a single point; that independence of cul-
ture is as important to American self—sufﬁciency as is the control of
the rubber market and the preservation of the tin supply.

This year the Carnegie Institute will not hold its annual In-
ternational exhibit. VVar strikes at art, indiscriminately, tellingly.
Out of this, as out of all evil, we have salvaged some good.

Today, the ﬁne arts department of the Carnegie Institute opens
its Survey of American Painting.

This, we believe, is a signiﬁcant milestone, a turning point. It
is the climax of a new era which has seen us design our own dresses
without ﬁrst consulting Paris. It overshadows the production of
moving pictures made solely for home audiences.

We do not believe in aesthetic isolation. The world has pro-
gressed through the interblending of ideas and ideals. 'We do be-
lieve, however, that the American Survey will reveal the idea upon
which we have always insisted, that America need borrow from none.

Higher Education

And National Defense

Entitled “Higher Education and National Defense,” a bulletin
issued by an American Council on Education has come to our atten-
tion.

Although the purpose of the announcement is to help college
and university administrators to develop “whatever degree of uni-
formity of attitude and practice may be possible and desirable re-
garding the administration of selective service,” the bulletin par-
ticularly interests us because of its analysis of the student ’s position
in the conscription.

We quote the bulletin:

In the case of students, two decisions are necessary:

Is it d.esirable to request postponement of training and service
until July 1, 1941‘?

Is it desirable to request deferment because of occupational
status‘?

For the ﬁr-st question it seems clear that the student who will
receive his degree before July 1, 1941 should request deferment
and continue in college. The student who is twenty-one but will
not complete his course before July 1 will need to evaluate all
the factors involved including his own personal plans and the na-
tional need.

Under normal circumstances he might well continue his studies
for the current year.

>)(= ‘it

If the student’s number in order of call is such that he will
probably receive his call during the school year 1941-42, it may be
wise for him to request the local board to advance his number so
that he will serve, for example, from July 1, 1941 to June 30, 1942,
and avoid the possibility of being interrupted in his studies in the
following academic year.

9% =)'.= $’.=

Future developments may very much alter the present situa-

tion. V
I =.‘I= it #4

The second question is one that must be considered now. Even
though the individual may postpone his service, the local board is
required to classify him at any time that his number is called, either
in Class I—D or I-E (students eligible for service not later than July
'1, 1941), or in Class II (occupational deferment).

If a. student, due to his specialized studies leading to a. pro-
fessional career in which shortages of trained men exist, has shown
exceptional ability, then, the local board, upon proper evidence
from a responsible oﬁicial of the college or university where the
student is registered, may place him in Class II as deferred for oc-
cupational reasons.

Certain students of engineering, medicine, pharmacy, dentis-
try, and other similar special courses may come in this category.

=%’ 5)? =l(=

In some instances individual students not necessarily in-
cluded above may be carrying on such distinctive work that it
may be wise to make a request for their occupational deferment.
The number of such requests will vary in any one institution but to
be most effective they should be limited.

To the Editor

‘Avid Denzocrat’
I s Puzzled

Editor, the Pitt News:

I can"L just ﬁgure out how to ex-
press it.

I think I’d like his dad too. May-
be even like this guy FDR Jr.

But your 24 column—inches of the
students’ newspaper devoted to- Bull
was about as subtle as the Old
Man’s national defense tours, and
just about as effective. Or do I
stand corrected after the ﬁrst Tues-
day of November?

Partisanship is OK and so is the
Senator under a byline, as they
were of course, but you didn’t say
anything except that “I liked this
guy.” So what?

Oscar offered me a Phillip Morris
once, but I refused it. I’m like
Uncle Appie. He chews tobacco.

Don’t get me wrong. I’m an avid
democrat, a third term-ite, and a

Explains Issues
Of Campaign

Editor, the Pitt News:

Disregarding the hazy generali-
ties of the third term bugaboo, the
fundamental issue involved in the
present political campaign is a “cru—
sade” by big business to regain con-
trol of government where it left off
in 1931. ,

Let us not be fooled by cries of
dictator . . . and propaganda of the
Republican press. Dictatorship
does not come from a popularly
elected executive; it is ﬁnanced by
big industrialists “crusading”
against another hypothetical evil. It
came to Germany and Italy as a
fight against Communism . . . Mus-
solini was ably ﬁnanced by (even)
American industrialists . . . with a
loan of $100,000,000 from Morgan
partners. This is the same group
ﬁnancing Willkie’s million dollar
bandwagon . . .

. . . Let us not get tricked by the
“barefoot boy from Wall street,”
who could hardly be called one of
the masses. He has spent his life
as a power utility lawyer lobbying
against bills . . in Congress; you
could hardly picture him going to
work with a “dinner pail.”

ANDREW B. MCCARDLE, C41.

Another ad lib by an unpr_omis-
ing freshman: Ed Hutchinson tells
us that girls with low shoes never
need heels to support them . .
We might add that other girls who
think they are being taken out are
often just being taken!

Night Work—A Study

And for the beneﬁt of people
who think school is hard Work,
you might ask Jack Frew, Joe
Murphy, Jack Nesbit, or Harry
Holt what it feels like to run a
steel mill on the side.

Clair Malarkey, of Bridgeville,
having suffered from a. broken
back in a fall from a derrick in
1931 from which he was never ex-
pected to recover, is one of Dr.
Carlson’s most promising looking
basketeers this year.

The football men have more
than tussling on their minds
Any worried looks on their part
are due to the sudden realization
of the terriﬁc number of streets
to be memorized prior to getting
their post ofﬁce jobs at Xmas
time . . .

A Complaint, Request
Frank “Delay” Miller, as usual,
"ms a complaint and a request .
He dislikes crowded hayrides and
asks for a guarantee of enough room
per couple on future events .
We want to know how much room
is enough! Another Miller
flash: The Newman club may not
rave a good grid club this year, but
they sure have a right smart pub-
l.i.citty agent playing way back in
the guise of this game Frankie.
Among the celebrites at tonight’s
Premier will be Bill Colvin
and Charlotte Harris Dick
Harmon and Betty Toddie
Mary Bowen and Karl Eagle .
Joe Roberts and Rhoda Plummer
. Bob Goodwin and Nancy
Sundstrom Nancy Crawford
and Tom Hodges . . . And, oh yes,
Bob lVliller’s frat pin is again adorn-
ing Toni Nesbitt’s sweater . . . The
only constant thing in the world is
change .

Pitt Scrubs Prepare
To Clean Up on Navy

Saksa-Fitchko Pass Combination

Gives Panthers Scoring Threat

By Bob Stodgell
It ’s “sink the .\'av_\'” day for the Panther B team this after-

noon Wlien they

grapple with the Middie reserves at Annapolis.

The Pittsburg'hers aim for their ﬁrst Win in ﬁve years.

l’itt’s B squad is a rare mixture.
except for one week in the fall.

Panther Injury
List Decreases

During Layoff

With the B squad momentarily
grabbing the Pitt grid spotlight, the
Panther varsity marks time during
.a two Saturday rest period in prep-
aration for the annual Pittsburgh
Civil War involving the Jungle Cats
and the Tartans.

The mid-season layoﬁ gives coach
Charley Bowser’s cripples a much
needed rest. The senior fullback-
ing sensation, George Kracum, gives
an ailing shoulder a chance to mend.
‘The big line plunger suffered a
‘shoulder separation in the snow
"ﬁght with Sleepy Jim Crowley’s
Fordham eleven.

Junior Johnny Gates may be
ready to take his customary second
-string guard berth by the time the
Tech clash falls, November 9. A
‘torn knee cartilage received in the
Southern Methodist fracas is slowly
responding to treatment.

In addition to th-e aforementioned
"injuries, several minor hurts among
the Panther gridmen keep head
trainer Harold Waite’s arnica bottle
from collecting dust. Special De-
livery Jones is still taking treat-
inent for his injured back, and
guard Ralph Fife and center Steve
Sinco require rub downs for body
bruises every day.

In reality the open dates in the
Pitt schedule gives the Panthers a
break for the strategy board can
revamp the team entirely in the next
two weeks.

Captain Ted Konetsky and Tiger
Jack Benz, the tackles who have
been doing close to 60 minute serv-
ice, also get a much earned respite.

It may be signiﬁcant that Bowser
kept second string quarterbacks
Tommy Murphy and Walt West be-
hind, for in most cases he sent the
third team men to Annapolis. Both
lads are very capable quarterbacks,
and are well worth experimenting
with to spell off Mike Sekela more
often.

They seldom play together,
Every October those guards,
get together and
practice for the annual Navy game.

The center of this year’s squad is
George “Poke” Allshouse, a pre-
dentist from Duquesne. “Poke’s”
father played for Pitt way back in
.1916 along with Dr. John Bain Suth-
erland.

Andrews at Guard

To the left side of Allshouse Will
be Melvin Andrews, and to the
right Dwight Emrick. Mel, the B
team casanova, is a member of Phi
Delta Theta and hails from Etna,
Pa. Dwight Emrick is a sophomore
Biz-Ad. You will know him on the
campus by his 1940 red Mercury se-
dan. Dwight played quarterback in
high sch.ool, but switched to guard
after his freshman year.

Crissman and Ward is a familiar
sound “up on the hill,” for both
names come in the same breath
when they call for tackles. Walt
Ward is a sophomore tackle, lately
shifted from guard position. Hard
charges are what he is noted for and
the Navy will realize this today. Bob
Crissman, another Phi Delt, is a
junior in the School of Business
Administration. Standing six feet
four inches, blond Bob is a Butler
product.

Fitchko’s Back Again

At the terminal position, Carl
Sardi and Bill Fitchko will answer
the roll call. Sardi, a senior and
also a pre-dentist, is a veteran on,
the B squad. He has played end
against the Navy for three years.
Right winger Bill Fitchko is a
smooth pass receiver and also does a
bit of drop kicking. Bill is a Theta
Chi.

Ralph Hammond, converted quar-
terback from Missouri, will direct
activities against the Navy from
the signal calling slot.

Frank Saksa and Lou Sleber will
do most of the ball toting. At left
half sophomore Frank will be toss-
ing bullet like passes to Fitchko.
Sl.eber, a senior, is a swift runner,
but has always been hampered by
injuries.

Malloy at Full

Irish Bob Malloy will be running
at fullback and endeavoring to kick
the ball into the Chesapeake bay all
afternoon. Bob is also a sophomore.

The entire party making the Navy
trip will include 25 players and two
coaches, Bill Daddio and Dick Ful-
lerton.

Players on the B squad are:

Centers? Allshouse, Jack Heister;
guards: Andrews, Emrick, Marty
Martorelli, Al Sampson; tackles,
Ward, Crissman, Allen Gartner, Bob
Stodgell; ends: Sardi, Fitchko, Bill
Lohmeyer, Larry Klotz, Tex Hinte;
backs: Malloy, Hammond, Saksa,
Sleber, Joe Adamchic, Bill Dutton,
Walt Fridiey, John Ross, Ray Rab-
inek.

That’s My Pop 2::

Mrs. Robert Thurbon, wife of the
Panther right halfback, presented
the Pitt star with a bouncing baby
boy last Sunday. Thurbon himself
could not be located for comment,
but teammates of the proud papa
claim that the right halfbacking sit-
uation for 1960 is well in hand.

Harriers Face

Five Tomorrow

After losing their ﬁrst three meets,
the University of Pittsburgh cross-
country team will attempt to swing
into the win column when it meets
a strong Carnegie Tech squad on
the Schenley Park course tomorrow.
In spite of the disappointing start,
the Panther harriers have shown
promise of better things to come.

Number one man in the lineup is
co-captain Walt Sterner, who has
performed brilliantly thus far. The
only other athlete to come up to ex-
pectations is sophomore Marcus Al-
lias. Co—captain Frank McCabe

.,.

WALT STERNER
doing nicely

has been slow in rounding into form
but should be ready for the Tartan
meet.

Against the Techmen, coach Ol-
sen w'ill start. the same squad that
performed against Purdue, Michi-
gan State, and the Army. Harriers
who are being counted upon to bear
the brunt of the burden in the quest
for victory number one are Sterner,
Allias, M-cCabe, and John Brosky.

Lack of suiﬁcient training was
one of the reasons advanced for the
poor showing of the Panthers,
against their ﬁrst three opponents.
Olsen also cited the exceptionally
high quality of competition this
year as a factor in the Panthers’
three setbacks.

Following the meet with the Tar-
tans, the Blue and Gold will turn
to the strong Penn State outﬁt which

will be here early in November.--

From all indications the Lions aim
to give the Cathedral aggregation a
hard battle.

WAA Plans to Ride
On All Hallow’s Day

Women’s Athletic association will
hold its ﬁrst horseback riding social
Thursday afternoon. The affair is
open to all freshman women and
WAA members who are interested
in riding, according to chairman
Ruth Mendoza, C43.

Special rates have been obtained
from the Fox Chapel Riding acad-
emy where the affair is being held.
Assessment will be 80 cents.

Transportation will be provided
for all women attending. Those in-
terested must sign up on the bulle-
tin board in the Cathedral gymna-
sium.

Assisting Miss Mendoza with the
arrangements for this event are
Aileen Kaufman, C43, and Harriet
Harris, C42.

Bazell Takes Over Yogi Division
And Co-Expert Lynch Laughs Last

By Sheme Bazell

With three major football aggre-
gations battling to preserve un-
blemished records, the job of pre-
dicting winners becomes more dif-
ﬁcult each week. For some reason
-or other gridiron schedules always
manage to have four or ﬁve tossup
‘contests on tap every Saturday. But
it’s always fun to stick your chin
«out, so here goes!

Michigan 21, Penn 19

This contest has been classed by
the “experts” as the Harmon-Rea-
gan battle. Both teams are unbeat-
-en and untied so far this year. It
will be a battle but the team that
doesn’t have Harmon is going to
lose. ‘
Stanford 14, Southern California 6

Stanford is the third member of
the undefeated trio for the week.
Although the Trojans have what it
takes to oﬁer plenty of competition,
.a victory for Stanford almost as-
sures them of a Rose Bowl bid.
‘That’s something to ﬁght for and
the Indians won’t disappoint.

Notre Dame 27, Illinois 6

Carnegie Tech can testify as to
the power of the ﬁghting Irish, and
since they are meeting a team that
has just recently had the Harmon
treatment, this should be another
easy one for Layden’s boys.

Fordham 19, St. Mary’s 7

Local fans should be convinced
-of Fordham’s power. The Rams are
a little weak on defense but What
they lack in this department, they

more than make up for offensively.
Cornell 13, Ohio State 6

Cornell’s offensive will be a little
too much for the Buckeyes.
Big Red has been taking it easy
while scoring 112 points and gaining
1.400 yards from scrimmage against
Colgate, Army, and Syracuse. Ohio
State will deﬁnitely show the ef-
fects of ba-ckbreaking battles with
Pitt, Purdue, Minnesota, and North-
western. ' _'

Tulane 21, North Carolina 6

This isn’t the consensus opinion
but the Green" Wave has ﬁnally
found itself after suffering three
setbacks earlier in the season. Foot-
ball forecasters predicted big things
for Tulane at the beginning of the
campaign. At the expense of North
Carolina, Tulane is going to prove
that it’s better late than never.

Minnesota 26, Iowa. 0

Minnesota won’t have any trouble
with Eddie Anderson’s lads. Unde-
feated and untied in competition
this season, the Gophers will still
have a clean slate when Saturday’s
contest goes into the record books.

Duquesne 21, Manhattan 0

The boys from the Bluff‘ lost a
tough one last week but the team
which will suffer for it will be Man-
hattan. Buff Donelli has a good
team and a few breaks last Satur-
day would have probably given the
Hilltoppers another undefeated sea-
son.

Mississippi 20, Colgate 0
Vlfhile on the subject of Duquesne,

The i

we might as well say something
about the team that beat them.
Mississippi is rated as one of the
strongest squads of the south. Con-
sidering Colgate’s record to date,
Mississippi should ﬁnd this one easy
pickin’s.

Oil & Gas Club Smothers Industrials,
Ca1'“9gieT"/"h Chem E J rs Top Civil Engineers

In a fast, free-scoring game, the
Oil and Gas huskies defeated the
lndustrials Tuesday, 24-6, in an En-
gineering league feature.

John Murphy scored the ﬁrst of
his three touchdowns early in the
ﬁrst half as he pulled one of Larry
Spenc-e’s long passes out of the air
in the end zone to put the Oil and
Gassers in ie lead, 6-0. The con-
version failed, as did all the other
attempts for the extra point
throughout the game.

Murphy scored again a few min-
utes later on a pass thrown by Wal-
ly Arnold. stepping across the last
white stripe to make the score read,
12-0.

The second half had just begun

when the Oil and Gassers again
scored on a long pass. This time it
was Frank Gacnger who took

Spencc’s long heave for the touch-
down and made the score 18-0.

The Industrials ﬁnally came out
of their lethargy and scored their
lone touchdown of the game on a
pass from Pete Krane to Ed Edge
in the end zone.

Arnold and Murphy combined on
another “air raid” to score the ﬁnal
touchdown of the game for the Oil
and Gassers and drive the score
to 24-6.

The Chem E J rs took the measure
of the Civil E’s in the ﬁnal game
of the day, 14-0, as they scored in
the opening minutes of play on a
short pass into the ﬂat from Fred
Evans to Joe Wilk, after a Civil E
fumble deep in the opposition ter-
ritory. The conversion failed.

Early in the second half Bert Ber-
ta-ccini was trapped behind his own
goal line by the Chem E3 and the
score rose to 8-0.

Wilk’s long pass to Jones Sipe
ended the scoring for the day, as
Sipe evaded the safety man and
crossed the goal line to make the
score, 14-0. As was the case
throughout the other game of the
day, the conversion again was no
good.

The ﬁrst two games of the day
ended in forfeits, when the New-
man club failed to make an appear-
ance for their scheduled game with
WWW, and the Political Science
boys didn’t show up for their game
with the Cherokees.

 Four
Grandson

Of Artist Is
Now at Pitt

By Georgia Shuset

In 1889 in Rome, Italy, Phillipe
Trovaioli was the object of the art
world’s acclaim.

His magniﬁcent sculptured repro-
duction of the Egyptian Temple of
Edfu had won for him the Grand
Prix de Paris, one of the most cov-
eted of all artistic awards, at the
Exposition Universale de Paris.

Now, 51 years later, his grandson
is enrolled at the University of
P-ittsburgh—with art as his interest
and the achievement of his grand-
father as his inspiration.

Dark-haired August Trovaioli,
C43, a Penn State transfer, reveal-
ed some of the experiences of his
colorful grandparent, on Wednes-
day afternoon, against an unartistic
background of eighth floor Cathe-
dral brick walls.

The work of art which won for
him the applause of innumerable
critics, took Phillipe Trovaioli eight
years to complete. But the remark-
able angle is that he was conﬁned
to his bed with malaria while he
worked on his masterpiece——only
able to move his hands.

“My grandmother would sit be-
side his bed as he worked, and as
he ﬁnished each miniature piece,
she would place it where he in-
structed,” August explained.

The piece, now on exhibition at
the London museum, was sold to
Thomas Cooke and company after it
received the award.

Carrying out the scheme of things,
August’s father is also an artist by
profession, and studied at the Royal
Technical academy at Rome.

The Pitt student was born in
Rome, but came to this country be-
fore he was a year old.

His grandmother, who was once
a lady-in-waiting to the then queen
of Egypt, lived in the family home,
“Belle Forte,” in northern Italy, un-
til her death last May, 38 years after
the death of her husband.

“My grandparents were guests of
the late king and queen of Egypt. at
the initial performance of Verdi’s
‘Aida,’ which, incidentally, was
written for the king,” the young art-
ist-student went on.

August, whose ambition is to come
near the artistic perfection of his
famous grandfather, has, at his
home in Uniontown, Pa., the original
plan of the sculptured piece which
won the famous prize.

He also has the original molds of
the reproduction and a plaque de-
scribing the sea battle between the
Ethiopians and the Numi.dians.

“Anyone is welcome to see them,”
he invited, “but I don’t think my
dad would allow me to bring them
away from home.”
