The University Band played to two
large Pitt crowds last week-—the four
thousand: or more spectators ‘an’. the
Penn State basket ball game, A and
the four or ﬁve hundred Evening
School etudsents who packed the Ho-
tel Schenley ballroom for the an-
nual .LEvening School Association
smoker on Saturday night- ‘

The performance of the band. at
the Motor ‘Square Garden : drew much

contests with the representatives: of
that institution. On Saturday night,

director, the band‘ was in charge of
As:s=ista.ntA Director Davis. V

In anticipation of the ‘band's home
concert, to be held on April 5 in
the Carnegie Music Hall, tickets. were
placed» on sale at the smoker, with
the result that a generous‘ number
was Atak-‘en by! the Evening School
men. Ticketsi-A are now available for
the April ,affair;A which will be the
first public conclert work of the Pitt
Band. and they may be procured at
Room 1, ,State.Ha.l:l, for $.75 and $1.
The price was purposely made mod-
erate in order to permit the event
to -be entirely within the reach of
every Pitt s-tVudentL.V ’ L’

The managers or the ,baVnd7are ar-
ranging several out-of-town perform-

the concert. sVacAh{eAduledA for 1A.px-Lu 5.
WithV these: 'eventL'.s to look forward
to, the players are beginning to ‘re-

feature. of the band’s‘activities. Mr.
Rooereto, coach of the band-, has ar-
ranged a A concert program which
will include music or ,every type.’
Lsvpedial stress is being placed at
present on the effective classical}
numbers being Lprepared.  ,4

Harvey Harman to

Coach Haverford

The Haverford College athletic au-
thorities announced last week the ap-
pointment of Harvey Harman, Pan-
ther tackle of the past year, as ‘head
coach of their football team for the
coming fall. Haverford is located,
about nine miles out from Philadel-
phia on the main line, and is one of
the best and most exclusive schools
in the east. She has never won great
fame, however, on the gridiron, so
that. Harvey will have his work cut
out for him, and will bring -a lot of
credit on himself if he can produce
a winner.

Harvey will graduate from the col-
legethis June. He has played on the
varsity four years, the ﬁrst being
the S. A. T. C. year of 1918, when
the freshman rule was temporarily
abrogated. He has played tackle all
the time and has been a tower of
strength on the line. His po-sition
on the varsity will be hard, to ﬁll
next year. ,

In campus activities Harvey is
president of the senior cla.ss, and last
year was presi-dergt of the junior class.
He is a member of Phi Gamma Delta,
0. D. K., and Turtles. He is one of

"the best known and best liked men

in Pitt and everyone wishes and pre-
dicts ‘great success for him in his
new venture.

mission to Junior dances and’ other
events.

The annaual class banquet, to be
held in the spring months, will be
another topic for discussion at the
next cabinet meeting. The success
or the ’23 banquet held last year
was such that the officers are desir-
ous of holding a.' banquet this year
that will at least equal it and, it
is hoped, be even a. greater success.
A committee to handle the banquet
will likely be appointed at least six
weeks‘ before the event takes place
in order to assure that the arrange-
ments will be complete and that the
aﬁair may hold an important place
in the plans of the Juniors.

" BAND CONCERT APRIL 5

Faculty Adviser Gustav L. Schramm
of the Pitt Band, has called at the
Alumni Office and asks us to correct
the article appearing in the "last issue
regarding the date of the Band's
Home Concert. We gave it as April 2,
whereas the correct date is Wednes-
day, April 5. Schramm says that the
band management is going to make
this the “biggest musical event in
Pitt's history,” and they are figur-
ing on a lot of support from the
alumni. The concert will be held in
Carnegie Musical Hall and, being the
first band concert ever given by the
Pitt musicians, will be an epochal
event at Pitt. The band is an organ-
ization‘ that the “grads” are mighty
proud of and it is pretty certain that
they will back the concert to the
limit.

THREE STUDENTS NAMED‘

inasmuch as contracts for favors and
programs had been let prior to Mr.
Hoehl’-s appointment as ﬁnancial su-
pervisor. It is announced that all
ﬁnancial transactions of the Prom
Committee subsequent to the ap-
pointment of Mr. Hoehl must .be ap-
proved by him. It has been further
announced ‘that the Prom Committee
will ﬁle the ﬁnancial report for this
function, the details of which report
were outlined in the “columns of The
Weekly last week. A conference
between the ﬁnancial supervisor ‘and
the Prom Committee will be held
within the next few days, at which
conference all plans; for the Prom
will be thoroughly discussed. . .

Regarding the dance to“ ‘be held
Friday evening under‘ the direction
of the 1Student Senate, Mr. Hoehl
announces that due to all arrange-
ments having been made prior to
his appointment and therefore, the
right of cancellation not having been
reserved-, the dance will «be held’ as
scheduled. As in ‘the case of the
‘Prom, financial statements will be
rendered for the Senate dance, the
new system -being applied to this ex-
tent. All future dances of the Sen-
ate are to be held under the same
rules as will be applied to social
events held by other organizations.

EVENINII Sﬂlllllll
0 SMIIIIER

The Evening Association held a
smoker in the Schenley Ballreom
last Saturday evening. Over 400 of
the Evening School students and
faculty, University officials, the Pitt
Band, and Pitt Weekly and- the Owl
staffs attended’. ,

The entertainment was furnished by
the SI'.lLd‘eIl:I’.aS and Prof. _ Gustav
Schramm had the band there to play
a number of -selections and the Twi-
light Students tried hard to drown
out the music with their singing.

C’u{I‘I'Y’. l\lg‘c;Laugh._lin, P.a.zrkb4ill,, J.
Roberts: and Crawford, the ballet
dancers, ﬁitted hither and thither,
through the modern cabaret steps,
passing “kisses”_out to the men.

George Nay and L. Joseph then
made the preliminary attack of the
evening on the “-blues” in an effort

"to locate the funny gone of the other

numbers to follow. Then came that
Evening School Quartet, led by Ken
Wilson and supported by Pilleter,
Bauer and Wehe. _

Russ‘ Hamilton then came breezin'
in from Podunk with all the chatter
a. monologuist should have and that
incidents of his trip were all that
one could expect of such a character.

Art James and Mal Cherry ‘came
on the program with their black
face dialogue. They told the truth.
Professor Umpf then disapproved
the theory that the eye was quicker
than ' the, hand by some mystical
passes of his wand.

The Evening School Banjo-Mandolin
Club then played some tunes which
sounded the strains of Evening
School o-rigin. Then they had the
cats. Lots of ’em. Apples, dough-
nuts and drinks.

'Curry and MacLaughlin then claim-
ed attention while they showed what
a real ventriloquist could do. And

requirements for a college degree” he

not only made a confession of the

loose administration ofhis and other

0 colleges, but he gave many ccilege

and university faculties and adminis-
trators something to think about.
The curriculum of an institution rests"
chieﬂy on the shoulders of the fac-
ulty; the assignments of study, refer-
ence and research rest entirely on the
shoulders of the faculty; the grading
of the work done by the students is
entirely in the hands; of the faculty-;
it is only the spirit of the institution
and the general reputation of the, in-
stitution that the student body con-
trol. The standard of scholarship in
any college and the value of the de-
gree it confers are entirely matters of
faculty and administrative control
and responsibility. , _ A ”

"In the Pitt Weekly for January..11,
R. Kay Miller inhis letter to the

iportance. His criticism was fine as

.far as it -went and we m_u‘stagree that

“courtesy and‘ respect are the marks:
of. agentleman.” But why apply this
test only to the students? . .
Since students are to be judged by
their ..respect and courtesy, why not

apply the same test to those whose

business ‘it is to set”f‘an eiiainplé and
are paid for their services? Students
are not alwayspto blame for their dis-
respect. They. show respect only
where respect is due. _ ' , 

‘ Courtesy “is-bred of courtesy, ‘and:
disgust and ‘disrespectare ‘likewise
perpetuated of themselves. Let the
instructor be‘ courteous to the stu-T
dent and inreturn he will receive re-
spectand courtesy. _- _ ».

If a larger number of men pursuing
college work, whether students« or
faculty, are to qualify under the
f‘ma.rks of a gentleman,” there. T-must
come about a feeling of sincerity and
responsibility toward each, other. ,

Yours sincerely,  0 i

THE GRAND .

 

it which drives a ‘man
on to success canot be subdued by ,
superﬁcial means, is one ofthe, ideas
brought out in George Arliss’s big
United Artists’ photoplay, “The Rul-
ing Passion,” which has been booked
to head the program‘ at the Million
Dollar Grand, Pittsburgh, throughout
next week, starting Monday morning,
“The Ruling Passion”
is a comedy drama of moderndlife,
dealing principally with as’ business
and the man who makes it. The
basis of the picture is Earl Biggers’
Saturday Evening Post story, “Idle
Hands{’ and it has been producedin
a way that makes it one of the year’s
Mr. Harry Davis, who
saw it in New York before pecuring‘
it for the Grand, considers it a splen-
did Qffering. and the;New York news-
paper critics "have been‘ unanimous, -
in acclaiming it a “perfect photoplay.”
One of the curious facts in connec- “
tion with the ﬁlm is that in it”Mr.-
achieved his biggest screen“
success with a role entirely foreign ,
to anything he has performed, either‘
on screen or speaking stage, in twen-
ty years. During that time the star,
who is known. as America’s ‘greatest 
characteractor,‘ has ‘devoted himself . 2
to the cynical, crafty, satirical,‘ sinis- *
But in “The Ruling Pas-
sion” he. is/‘seen as James Alﬁden, a

  SUBSCMPTIIIN Burns

Although through the columns of

 

The Weekly, ‘Pitt students have
been advised that, due to apparent

- lack of interest therein, it has been
-deemed. advisable to discontinue pub-

lication of the Pitt Review for the
gurrent academic year, _the graduate
manager of Student Activities re-
ports that only two requests- for re‘-
fund have «been made by subscribers.

fstudentgs who subscribed. for the

Pitt Review in’ September are urged
to ca.ll_.at_R.oom 1, State Hall, and
upon surrender of subscription blank,
receive the proper refund. This
-should ‘be done without delay so that
the books ' of the Review can be
closed and a ﬁnal ﬁnancial report
for that publication made, to the
Advisory Board on Student Activi-
ties.

During the school year * 1920-21,
the Review was published at a slight
proﬁt: » The graduate manager an-

nounce‘s‘ that the books -have been _

audited, that all -bills have been
paid and that J. BL. Nicklas, Jr., who
served as manager of the publication,
has sent -a. check for the entire sur-
plus to Dr. S-. .B. Linhart, treasurer
of the Adzvisorry Board. Mr. Nick-
las, in his letter’ enclosing the check,
recommended‘ that the surplus" of
the -Review‘ be applied toward the
support of other student activities.

Avoid Unproﬁtable Moods. A

Angry moods and “gro11vc=‘-m-.s" and
their twin sisters, “grudges,” serve ab-
solutely no purpose. If some one
hurts or wounds us generously forget
it. Time heals the deepest cuts and
makes us braver and wiser for the
experience- Letus love life and its
worth-while things and avoid all un_-.
proﬁtable moods. Otherwise happi-
ness will never come our way, and if
we search for it, it will ﬂee from us
like a phantom, for after all it is the
state of our mind.

  Benjamin G. Lemme

. . ‘ VISITORS at the Chicago World’s Fair, in
 ~ 1893, saw the ﬁrst extensive use of alternat-
ing current ever undertaken, when Westinghouse
lightedithe entireA.grounds with: this type of‘cu‘r-
rent. This achievement marked the beginning of
thecommercial development of alternatingcurrent
for power purposes, and brought the induction
motor into‘ a prominence which it has never since
relinquished. Great and rapid have been the de-
'.velopments since that day, but the most impres-
‘ . sivevaspect of this progress is not to befound in
the spectacular evidences that are visible to
everyone, but rather, in the vision and funda-
Inental soundness and determination thgt have
. been Aquietly at work blazing andclearingtlietrails
Whichgthe electrical art has followed.

 I There is, for instance, the synchronous con- A
verfter-_.. This machine is the most efﬁcient and A
-economical means for changing alternating to
d.ire'ct current, I which. the operation of most
street railway systems and many other processes
zrequire. Without it, the development of
Anating current to its present universal usefu ness
would Akave‘ been tremendously retarded.

ter-

A [The synchronous converter, in its present per-A
fection, is but one of Ctheggreat contributionsato
electrical progress that have been made  Ben-
jamin G. Lamme, Chief Engineei‘ of the Westing-
house Electric &.Manufacturing Company. Mr. -
Lamme, in. 1831 when. he was Chief Designer,

‘conceived  'deve-lcyéed the converter, which,
first used commerciallyin connection with the

great N iagarapower plan, has since come to be
indispcnsible to. large producers of power.

‘— When a man  played so vital a part in elec-
trical progress tbat his knowledge and vision
have contributed to practically every forward
engineering step, it is perhaps misleading to at-—
tempt to identify him particularly with any one
A development. His work on the induction motor,
.A the turbo generator, the singIe—phasc railway
motor, and the synchronous -converter is but
typical of the constructive ability which Mr.
Lamme has brought to bear on practically

phase of electrical development.

' A man of foresight, Visioning the ,alternatives

man Whose mind combines great power of analy-
sis with the gift of imagination. Aproliﬁctechnical
writer, whose style is unequalled in clcarness and

simplicity of expression. Few

thoroughly predetermine the results they actu-
ally achieve. Few men capitalize their experiences
so completely. And few ingeed have at once his «
thorough technical equipment, his commercial
understanding, and his broad human interests.
An institution which has builded its success
largely on engineering achievement pays Benja-
V min G. Lamme affectionate loyalty-and respect.

most seasoned co-worker, ﬁnds ‘in him under-

No.: 7-CHUCK BOWSER
C There are few more versatile men
in Pitt than “Chuck" Bowser. “Chuck"
played varsity led:'t:end on the grid-
iron this year, but he has played al-
most every other position. On the
freshman team in 1919, “Chuck”
played a guard. Last year on the
varsity at different times he played
in regular games end, tackle, center.
and quarterback. This year -helstarted
at center but later switched positions
with Herby Stein arid from then o-n
played end, at which position he
seems to be most at home and to
have really found himself. “Chuch”

Pitt has ever had. Veryefew gains
were registered around «his end last
season and he was prominent time
after time in smearing the opponent’s
plays. ” - . ~

,“Chuck’s" versatility is‘ not con-
ﬁned to the  alone but ex-
tends to other branches of athletics
and to everything in general. In
Sum, he is good at anything he
tackles. “Chucks” plays a good game
of basketball and especially of base-
ball, although «.he has never gone out
for the. varsity teams here.. He ex-
pects howeverhto report for baseball
this year and those who have seen
him play predict that someone will
have his work cut o-ut for him to
keep him off the nine, for. he is a
hard hitter, has a great throwing
arm, and can play almost any posi-
l‘.l'0Il. I’;

“Chuck” shines in the class room
also, as any student in the School
of Economics can tell you. He is
just a junior and there are very few
better scholastic records» in the junior
class of Economics. His grades last
year were the best of these made by
members of the football team. “Chuck”
is a fellow of ﬁne character -and
pleasing personality, -and is universal-
ly popular with all the fellows around
school. Another good ‘thing about
him is that he doesn’t allow himself
to be bothered very much by the
women. “Chuck” is a member of
Phi Delta Theta. 1

No. 8--“RED” BYERS”

Franklin E. Byers, far better
better known as “Red,” is a junior
in the School, of Economics, letterman
in both football and basketball, and
at the present time is shining at the
latter sport. On the gridiron, “Red”
isa half—backL and came into particu-
lar prominence in the State game of
1920 when he played a whale of a
game and showed his real ability as
runner... Prior‘ to that,
“Red” hasplayed a nice game on
the freshman team of the year be-
fore. “Red”, ~ however, probably
shines better as a basketball player
than as a grid hero. Last year

.‘fRed” stepped right into the breach

at guard, left by the retirement of
John McLean,‘ and made good from
the start. He is fast, hangs -onto his
man in great shape, and is awonder
at breaking -away, dashing up the side
of the ﬂoor, and tossing -them in from
the L1 corner of the court. Some of
“Red's” shots, especially those from
the side ‘are beautiful to?" behold.
Many‘ look upon him as one of the
most accurate shots that ever stepped
on a basketbali ﬂ.oor. V

“Red's” home is in Turtle Creek,
Pa., at the Union High of which town
he starred in fathletic-s‘before coming
to Pitt. “Red” is a very popular
young man and has made a host of
friends at Pitt.‘ He is a member of
Phi Gamma Delta and of the Turtles.

of the Sporting Editor on the football situation d_ev-eloped through t e sign-

star tackle, Claude Thor-nhill, of contracts with Leland Stanford University,
“Pop” to assume the coaching ‘reigns there at the expiration of his contract
here, yet because the situation is probably one of the most acute in the his-
tory of Pitt athletics, because student opinionwas not had an opportunity
to express itself, because of the many angles to ‘the situation, and because
new developments are apt’ to take place at any time. and especially tomorrow
night ‘at the meeting of the Athletic”
comment should be postponed until next week. The students are reminded,
however, that the football team is theirs and that the Athletic Council de-

have participated this season’, the Pitt
Freshies went down to defeat ‘before
the irresistible vattlack of the Penn
nSta«te Freshmen in the preliminary
to the* Pitt-State contest at Motor
Square Garden on last Friday night.
The game was played before the larg-
est crowd of the season and although
the Blue. and Gold did not emerge
victorious they still managed to put
up a 'ﬁg;ht' that did themecredit and
made their opponents realize that
they had been playing against one
of the best teams in their class in the
East. S c

The Penn State boys; deserved to
win. They took the lead at /the be-
ginning of the contest and were never
headed. Despite the fact that our
Freshies put up what was probably
their best game of the season they
were fairly beaten. The N-ittany team
guarded our forwards so closely that
the Froshdiad to be content with long‘
shots from the middle of the floor,
and this style of play proved to -be
"disastrous, for while the Panther
guards kept State's forwards as far
away from the basket as theirs kept
ours, they made many more long shots
which registered than we? did. ‘The
play was fast" at all times, with the
visitors generally forcing the pace.
Their team-work was slightly better
than ours also; as they had the ball
near their basket uch more. than we
-did. is S

‘The visitors scored first when
Stuckmain dropped a beautiful free
throw through the basket, without
eventouching the ring. They rapidly
ran this lead‘ up until when the Frosh
ﬁnally did score they had. run-up -a
lead of seven points. ' ‘

-The score stood at 17-12 at the end
of the ﬁrst half. At the opening of
the second half the F/reshies -started
a rally that looked like a?sure‘win-
hing streak and at one time they had
the score 18-16, but the _. pace Awas
too fast and during the closing mo-
merits of the icon-testl the visitors ran
up a commanding lead. _

There was very little individual
playing, but of that little the men
who stood out most prominently were
Hartman, the visiting captain,_ and
Flanagan, Buchanan, and ’Fawcett. for
the Frosh. The summary follows: L

PANTHERS LIJSE Tlllllill
E HAME Tl] PENN sun;

The Penn State basketball team
surprised everybody last Friday _even-
ing on the Motor Square Garden ﬂoor
when the usually strong Mount Nit-
ta-ny ﬁve handed the Panthers-a 30-27
defeat. '

The result of this game was [ex-‘
pected by very few,-_-—-in fact, even the
Nittany Lions themselves came here
expecting to be the possessors of__rthe
short end of the score. But the Penn
State aggregation played wonderful
basketball and lengthened its long
string» of victories over‘ our L floor
teams. . 

Pitt played ‘with its. entire regular
‘team for the ﬁrst time in two weeks.
This‘ was very evident for quite a
while in the game. In the first ‘half
they could hardly get’ started, only
two field goals ‘being ‘scored by the
Panthers. .

However, although Pitt scored only
two goals from the ﬁeld during the
first half, she was leading at half
time. Jordan and Levenson had each
scored a ﬁeld goal, and the latter had
been successful in; ten out of thirteen
attempts from the foul line, thus giv-
ing Pitt 14 point-s. Penn State, in
the meantime had scored only a dozen
points. ’ W

In the second half, our team still
failed to get started. Penn State mow

penetrable. Only on one or two oc-
casions were we able to get the ball
in the immediate vicinity of the‘ bas-
ket. Penn State, in the meantime, hav-
ing been re-enforced by the injection
of itslstar, McCol1um, was strength-
ened also ‘otfensively. At least it
looked that way, for -the ﬁeld goals
dropped through their basket at the
critical stages with alarming regular-_
ity.’ . ' . '
But our boys stim fought. -Byers,
Jordan, and Funk each managedto
score a ﬁeld goal, and Levenson con-
-tinued his steady foul shooting, with
the res‘ t that Penn State never had
a ‘big -lead. The only time Penn-State
looked like a’ sure winner was near
the end of the game, when Reed and
K-oehler made‘ some serns-ational goals
from the ﬁeld.‘ Yet their lead was
no Lgreater -than ﬁve. However, in

After*a.two-weeks’ lay-of, the fra-

this Friday afternoon at the Indoor
Track when the intermediate medley
relay will be run. ‘ This '-relay will
consist of two ‘two-l.aps,. two three-
laps or ‘quarter-miles, and one six-lap
or half-mile. LWith the standing of
the teams so close and practically
every fraternity having competed in
one or more events, it is likely that
