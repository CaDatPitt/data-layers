Share

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Governor Milton Shapp has un-
veiled a new tax bill which calls
for a 2.5 per cent state income
tax.

At a joint session of the State
Legislature Monday. Governor
Shapp warned that “a tax reform
is needed now. or the Common-
wealth will run out of money by

\ Ste end of August." He threaten-

d— to veto all stop-gap appropria-
tions after July 31 if his tax pro-
posal is not enacted. This. he
said. would suspend all State
services.

The proposal affects income
classifications such as wages.
profits. capital gains. interests
and dividends. Exemptions are
granted for low-income families.
and the disabled. while veterans’
payments. social security and
welfare payments are not count-
edas income.

Credit would be given for pay-
ments already made under the
graduated income tax, ruled un-
constitutional by the State Su-
preme Court.

The Governor also revealed "a
cut in the States budget to $890
which is $120 million

    Pitt   Announces

Tuition Hike  

For the fourth consecutive year. .
the University has announced a
tuition increase f'o_rgraduate and
undergraduate students.

Announcement of the increase.
effective with the fall term. 1971.
contained in a letter sent
Monday‘ to Pitt's 132.000
dents by Edison Montgomery’.
Vice Chancellor of Finance.

Full-time graduate and'under-
graduate students who qualify as
Pennsylvania residents will pay
$60 more per term in tuition un-
der the new fee of $485.

Part-time undergraduate Penn-
sylvania students will pay $35 per
credit this fall; previously, they
had paid $30 for each credit. Part-
time graduate students from
Pennsylvania will ‘pay’-$44 per
credit, a $6 increase over the $38
per credit fee previously‘ levied. 1

in the School of Law. full-time

Pennsylvania students will pay

$5223. - an“ increase of $100. over
last years per term rate. Full-
time out-of-state students in Law

a will pay $1.020 each term; last‘
year th_eir'tuition was $980.

-‘The Schools of Medicine and
Dental Medicine will charge $600
per term for full-time students
-from Pennsylvania. up from last
years charge of $510.

Tuition, for out-of-state stu-
dents, other than those in the
School of Law, will remain the
same. Montgomery explained that
since the primary reason for
Pitt’s financiallsqueeze was the
failure of the State to come up

jects and legislative district of-
fices.

Dick Parti. assistant to House
Majority Leader K. Leroy Irvis.
told the Pitt News that lrvis
"liked the last tax better. The
new one would hurt the low-in-
come groups. and many Demo-
crats. especially those represent-
ing low income areas are deeply
concerned."

According to House Minority
Leader Kenneth B. Lee, “The
Governor has submitted a budget
prior to submitting a tax pro-
gram. A cut of $120 million isn’t
enough,” Lee maintained, “$200
million is more acceptable.”

The Republican Party. ‘Lee said.
will refuse to consider a vote un-
til the Governor agrees to the
following provisions: equitable
school subsidies. which are con-
trary to the Governor's proposal
of funding mainly Pittsburgh and
Philadelphia schools; the passage
of a welfare bill which would give
the Legislature the power of dis-
pensing welfare tAccording to
Lee. the Republicans will not ac-
cept any tax reform unaccom-
panied by a welfare reform as
well»; and changes in the unem-
ployment compensation law.
which Lee insists “goes beyond
the necessity of providing income
for the increasing cost of living.

Instead it creates a burdensome

business tax. which forces indus-

tries to make lay-offs. rather than
hire more workers."

Vice Chancellor of Finance Edi-
son Montgomery. discussing the

implications of the proposed tax
for the University. said that ‘he
doesn't know how Pitts budget
will be affected. “Governor Shapp

with - sufficient funds, it was
thought to be unfair to tax‘out-of-
state students for the added bur-
den.

"We felt that our out-of-state
tuition is covering virtually all of
the costs of education.“ said
Montgomery.

In his letter to students. Mont-A

gomery advised them that "every
effort is being made to keep-costs
at a minimum and to secure as
much support as possible from
sources other than the student."

However, h_e noted, in the ab-
sence of “adequate public and
private” funding, Pitt -has “ne-
other recourse than to lll(‘l'L".-i*..U.f
tuition." »

The of'f'icial announcement of the
tuition hike dashes the slim hope
that the State would increase its
grant to the University. Although
the State Department of Educa-

tion justified an allotinentof‘ $55.6 \
_. million for Pitt. Governor Shapp

recommended $43.2 "million in
his budget proposal.

"Chancellor Wesley Posvar

warned students in a June 21 let— '

ter that unless more State aid

was forthcoming. tuition would.

have to be raised. Posvar noted
that the Commonwealth was re-
luctant to offer added funds des-
pite increased enrollment and
services by the University.

The new $970 per year tuition
fee equals Temple University’s
tution level, but falls short of the

“ $1,000 fee suggested by the State

Master Plan for Higher Educa-

tion.

‘The tuition hike also means
that. for thefourth consecutive
year. Pitt students must dig
deeper into their pockets to fi-
nance their higher education.

A University professor has filed
suit against the University. charg-
ing discrimination against wom-
en as a class.

The class action suit has been
filed by Dr. Ina Braden. assistant
professor of Dental Behavioral
Sciencein the School of Dental
Medicine. Braden. who claims her
employment here will be termin-

ated because of her affiliation

with the University Committee
for Women‘s Rights (UCWRL fil-
ed suit -in her own behalf and for
all women employed in a profes-
sional capacity by Pitt since Jah-
uary 1. 1968.

The plaintiff is asking damages
in excess of 3510.000.

A summons from a Federal Dis-
trict Court was served the Uni-
versity Monday; Pitt must reply
in writing by Aug. 1.

In the civil suit. Pitt is charged
with effecting policies and prac-
tices of unlawful. systematic ex-
clusion of and discrimination
against women as a class. Pitt is
also accused of the following: 0

volved in the search for dis-

crimination and inequality of_

employment at the University.

The University was recently
cleared on seven -of nine similar
charges during a Department of
Health, Education, and "Welfare
investigation. It has made recti-
fication where it was found guilty.

Braden in the suit said that she
has been informed that her con-
tract. which expires in 1972. will
not be renewed. A University
spokesman said that Braden was
notified of this before she became
active in the women‘s liberation
movement.

Braden was unavailable for fur-
ther comment.

°’-Crisis: Women In Higher Education’

Institute Probes Institutional Sexism ~ «

by POI-ILA SMITH
News Editor

Approximately 30 men and
women are sitting around a large
table, sipping coffee and listening

intently to an older woman dis-'

cuss sexism in the Church.

The woman is a Roman Catho-
lic nun. Sans traditional habit,
she is on leave from her order to
study at Yale Divinity School.

Both men and women laugh as.

she describes the “sexist" doc-
trine of the Roman Catholic faith,
as described in a Catholic ency-
clopedia written in the early
1900’s.

Women, she says,cannot be part
of the clerical hierarchy. Once.
women were defined as being in-
ferior to me because they were
simply “ambulatory recepticle s"
of pre-natal children, while men
were superior because they were
"sowers of the seed.” the propa-
gators of more Roman Catholics.

Wary, lest the audience find
dilly Roman Catholic theologian
sexist, she attacks Martin Luther
fdr depriving women of their only
chance to hold positions of au-
thority in cloisters, and Jews for
once considering members of the
faith,» only those who had been
circumcized._

The group also hears reports on
ways to develop affirmative ac-
tion plans and other legal re-

courses forinnovating programs in
women‘s equality in institutions
of higher learning.

The occasion is the wrap-up of
the Feminist Institute. a four-
week seminar sponsored by the
United States Office of Education
and housed at the University. Nia-
tionwide participants directed
themselves to the topic “Crisis:
Women in Higher Education."

FEIG DIRECTOR

Dr. Konnilyn Feig, director of
the Institute and director of Spe-
cial Programs at Pitt. first pro-
posed the Institute to meet what
she considered last July a need
for recognition and change in the
area of sexism in institutions. The
Institute, as defined in the pro-
gram. would “assist institutional
representatives who are concern-
ed about action programs in de-
veloping employment and educa-
tional opportunities for women."

The participants would ex-
amine such areas as the women‘s
movement. the law and legal pro-
cedures. case studies of success-
ful action against sexism. and the
study of such special programs
as women‘s studies and child care
centers. After receiving the go-
ahead from the Office of Educa-
tion, Feig and her staff advertis-
ed for interested applicants in 40
national journals. She said~they
were looking for a wide cross-
section of participants—people

from private and public institu-
tions, from two-year and four-
year schools, from all geographic
areas of the United States. They
wanted both men and women of
all races and all ages.

“Specifically,". Feig said, “we
were looking for people who would
be able to change their institu-
tions. People with the experience.
the position. and,or the energy
to get things done.“

Those interested were required
to fill out detailed applications

"How do you anticipate using
your position and expertise to af-
fect institutional changes with re-

gard to women during the next‘

year?" and “What steps would
you like to see your institution
take within the next two years to
improve the position of women
faculty. staff, and students?"

There were over 800 inquiries.
A panel reviewed the applications
and chose 25 government parti-
cipants, seven men and 18 women,
who received a small stipend
from the government for attend-
ing. They came from such diverse
places as Norfolk University.
Tufts College. San Francisco Col-
lege. Radcliffe Institute. and
Cornell University. They were
students, faculty members. and
administrators. They ranged in
age from early twenties to late
sixties.

SPEAKERS, WORKSHOPS

Nearly 40 part and full-time fac-
ulty members spoke and conduct-
ed workshops in their areas of in-
terest. For example Gloria Steinem
national spokeswoman for the
movement and contributing editor
of New York Magazine, led dis-
cussions on the national women's
liberation movement and the rev-
olutionary impact of women‘s
liberation.

Nancy van Vuuren, director of
Research, Pennsylvania State Hu-

man Relations Commission, spoke
on the role and procedures of the
State Human Relations Commis-
sion. Two black administrators
from Pitt, Drs. Donald Hender-
son. Associate ‘Provost, and
James Kelly, Associate Dean of
the School of Education, discuss-
ed power politics and institutional
change.

As one participant pointed out,
“She (Feig) did everything to
bring in the top women from all
over the United States. She
tried to find out who all of the key
people were.”

/.

In addition the members work’(:l

ed singly and in groups on pro-

jects such as the sisters study on
theological sexism.

The participants were enthu-
siastic about the Institute. One
woman from Florida said it was
“one of the most organized and
well-planned institutes" she had
ever attended. “This will go down
in history—the Pittsburgh Insti-
tute."

Asked what had been the most

important thing learned at the‘

seminars, most found it difficult

to specify. Several agreed, how-

ever, that they learned the most
from each other’s experiences.
“Every person is involved in a
big way on his own campus.”

Plans for a book and a film on
the Institilté are being completed.

Commnnity Interaction

by MICHELLE PILECKI

The interaction of a major.
urban university with the sur-
rounding community is the sub-
ject of investigation the Univer-
sity-Urban Interface Program
(UUIP). conducted under the
office of the Vice Chancellor
for Public Affairs.

Financed federally by the Of-
fice of Education tUSOE). the

Eﬁrogram is part of a three-fold

‘\

thrust involving Pitt. the newly
institutionalized Federal City
College of Washington D.C..
and the Bureau of Research of
the USOE. The purpose of UUIP
here is to study. chronicle and
evaluate the efforts of an estab-
lished major urban institution
during a time of change. The
program incorporates five maj-
or priorities: Minority and Com-
munity Services. Campus Devel-
opment. Communications. Em-
erging Goals and Governance.

Under Minority
munity Services is “Operation
Outreach,” four programs con-
_ducted by various schools and
departments within the Univer-

Chancellor

and Com-

sity. One of these projects; is
the Hill District Psychology
Center for Primary Prevention,
under the direction of Dr. Jer-
ome Taylor of the Clinical Psy-
chology Center. This program
deals with the prevention and
treatment of handicaps in ghetto
children.

Another Outreach program
that has met with neighborhood
success is the Student Consultant
Project. run by the Graduate
School of Business. Originally
the idea of a business grad stu-
dent. the program offers the ad-
vice and expertise of students to
businessmen in the Hill.

Director of Research Programs
Dr. Robert Brictson emphasizes
that UUIP is not involved in any
of these service programs, but
is directed more toward the stu-
dy of these community-focused
programs. He ‘explained that
their study is “to help other uni-
versities be a ‘good neighbor,’
and be ‘involved,’ not just ‘in’
their communities.”

The Pitt study is to show the
effects on the surrounding com-

munity of various university pro-
grams and policies. The results
of the study will be made avail-
able to policy-makers here are
elsewhere to further determine
"how the objectives of the uni-
versity can be reached within
the community."

Brictson pointed out that the
universities are no longer "ivory
towers where study of philoso-
phy. the arts and science are
nurtured and passed on." but are
expected to change roles and be-
come involved in solving the
communitys problems. The pur-
pose of UUIP. he adds. is to stu-
dy the possibilities for urban-
university involvement.

Included among urban prob-
lems is that of university expan-
sion. Project Research Director
Paul Shaw, working in the pri-
ority area of Campus Develop-
ment, has met with members of
People’s Oakland and the City
Planning Commission to research
the effects of possible Pitt ex-
pansion.

He pointed out that it is not-
able that such an organization
like Peoples Oakland has been
formed. and adds that the com-
munity can affect university
policy. as well as vice versa.
He said that he sees the pro-
gram as "an investigation of
how the universitys resources
are being used to fulfill the
communitys needs."

Petition Presented In

M cF mlrlen ’s Defense

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

A petition commending Dan
McFadden and bearing 35-40
signatures has been presented to
the Chancellor.

The petition. originally signed
by Dale Gill and Richard Box.
Secretary and Chairman of the
Undergraduate Orientation pro-
gram respectively. takes excep-
tion to the recent discrediting of
McFadden by the Advisory Coun-
cil on Women‘s Opportunities
tACWO) and the Black Action
Society tBAS>.

The petition suggests that a
University-wide survey be taken
to assess the credibility of Mc-
Fadden.

McFadden, Executive Assis-
tant Vice Chancellor for Student
Affairs, came under fire in two
letters received by Chancellor
Posvar several weeks ago. One
memo, sent by the ACWO, said
that McFadden had no credi-
bility among women and blacks
of the University community.

Contents of the second letter.
from the BAS. were not reveal-
ed.

McFadden had been under
consideration for the post of act-
ing Vice Chancellor for Student
Affairs when the present Vice

Saga and Szabo:
.S’za&a,/1/tom’ ,7/4. 

 

 

  

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

Szabo has come. like the fog. on little (at feet. ‘

Few in the Towers Cafeteria Saturday afternoon
seemed to notice that their lunch, for the first time in
11 years, had not been prepared by Saga Food Service.

“There haven‘t been any changes yet. except in
the menus.“ said a student employee.

“We haven‘t had any problems." said Ken lick-
holm. General Manager of Sza bo Food Service.

“Food is food." said an indifferent. diner.

For the record Szabo Food Service of Lyons, Illi-
nois, offered hamburgers and .french'fries, miniature
hot-dogs and sauerkraut for its initial meal. (Yes, Sza-
bo did serve breakfast. Breakfast, however,‘is not a
meal, Breakfast is a punishment.)

The luncheon fare. if it did not earn Szabo imme-
diate Kudos provoked no known cases of indigestion.‘

Opinions of the new food services debut were gen-

’ ~~»—~-ergaiiy ea.u_tious.-- — .. -- ~ ~ - - - --

W s Among the guilty few who repented with break-
fast, the consensus seemed to be that the scrambled
eggs were tastier, “less metallic,” as one put it.

‘Although satisfied with the food and service. one
diner said she felt that the  . . help, was a little on
edge around the top brass."

   Page Of Opinion I

Eckholm. topmost of the brass. was pleased with

' the way Szabo had taken over the University‘s food“

ser..vice‘ operation from Saga._

“There have ‘been no disruptions in service what-
soever,” said. Eckholm. He added that student employ-
ees had been “most cooperative” in abetting Szabo’s
transition .

 The only visible chink in Szabo‘s opening-day pan-

oply was the absence of individual meal tickets usually

sold at the» Main Towers Desk. Smiling checkers. how-
ever. were more than willing. eager in fa_ct. to admit
anyone who plunked down a dollar and aquarter.

I Eckholm said that it was really too .early to eitpect
to receive student. uh..feedback about Szabo’s opera—.

tion, He probably will receive none until the fall. The
scattered few-who-sampled Szabos meals Saturday can-
not compare in size or capriciousness to the bustling
crowds of the regular terms. A '
September will bring Szabo’s acid taste test, -and
.. the food service is preparing some innovations for it.
Planned are several “nationality nights," such as Roman
Nigh_t and Parisian Night, when thefood and decor
will match a cosmopolitan theme. . .
Szabo i's"~ also devising a gala inaugural for the
first day of the fall term. "It's something the kids are
all going, to like." promised Eckholm. who preferred
to keep the details a mystery, ‘

FOOD FOR THOUGHT: After 11 years, the Saga saga
has ended. The food service chores will now be han-
dled by Sxabo Food Service of Lyons, Illinois. Above
and below. diners sample the last supper, Saga style.-

The as yet unconfirmed rumor floa-ting around the
Housing Office is that Szabo’s grand opening will
feature a Kwakiutl. Night. The Kwakiutls Indians. as you
may know. used to throw potlatches. friendly gatherings
where the host would donate all his worldly possessions
to his guests. - '

Of course. one could only celebrate a potlatch ev-
ery so often. and should Szabo decide to hold a Kwa-

kiutl Night. the first evenings‘ potlatch‘ will probably

be followed by a week of potluck.

After eleven years at- Pitt. Saga Food Service serv-
ed its last meal here last Friday night. to be replaced
by Szabo Food Service the following morning.

The Friday night atmosphere at the Towers Cafe-
teria was one of almost solemn respect. Student din-
ers spoke in hushed tones, and were reluctant to offer
adverse comments about the_quality of the food offer-
ed. ’

A senior. E. P. Morgan. saidthat "Normally. it's
lousier than hell—but today it was good."

Other students nostalgically related fond meiiior-Q

ies of Saga: "Sloppy Joes without buns." and "gelatin
containing chunks of glass;‘‘ One student commented‘
that eating Saga food had been an adventure. like open-
ing a box of Cracker Jack: "You never knew what you

' might find."

 

’I‘he

A small group, who preferred to "remain anony-

-mous, announced that they had even held their own
 miniature. version:of .'the” last supper-,.. “complete” with -aif‘ i

candle and a bottle of wine. -

A member of the group elaborated on the farewell
ceremony. a candlelight dinner. “We lit the candle
with Chinese fortunelmatches for health—just to be on
the safe side.“ -

One girl in the group. a temporary student here.
said that shehad also eaten Saga food in Detroit. “and
hated every minute of it." ~ ,

Yet there were a few eager eaters in the crowd. .

One student helped himself toseconds, and even thirds.

There was also a small group of students who stole
into the cafeteria without paying. Other diners were
shocked at theoccurence: why would anyone be so
anxious . . .7 A few even questioned their sanity. One
student pointed out. however. that "At least that way
they get their moneys worth." ‘

Would‘ Saga be missed‘? Most students responded
to this question with general hysteria. Yet perhaps
the feeling was summed up best by one student who
simply smiled and said. "Aloha.“ ‘

'Summer of ’42’ Bittersweet Memory

by I<.}\'AN PATTAK
Associate Editor

The sexual awakening of the
adolescent is a frantic. frighten-
ing hell. a lonely limbo liatinted
by nightmares. pliantasms. and
the awful reali/.ation of ones
self.

The sexual awakening of the
adolescent is an enlightening.
beautiful dream. the joyous af-
firmation of humanity.

Thesexual awakening of’ the
adolescent is both of tliese-
night—mare and dream; that. for
better or worse. signals the end
of childhood.‘

Each of us can recall his own
coming of age. Herman Raucher
has shaped his youthful hopes
and fears into Summer of "42.
a lyrical, hypnotic, touching
picture that, for the most part,
duality
of the loss of innocence.

Fifteen-year-old Hermie ttjary
Grimesl spends the summer of
‘42 at the shore. straining to
hear life's secrets whispered on
the waves.

He and two fellow seekers en-
list the aid of a medical ency-
clopedia but cannot decipher
the cryptic Latin terms. (Come
to think of it. coitus interruptus
does sound vaguely like a Rom-
an military hero. l

Hermie suffers all the abomi-
nations of growth: the skeptical
pharmacist who won’t sell him
that first box of rubbers; the
art of the pick-up; derision from
his friends, faux pas before the
love of his life.

That summer for Hermie is

close. he
lleriiiie irre-

apocalypse. At its
leaves a part of
trievahly behind.

Summer of ‘+12 is not the first
film to plumb the ineasureless
caverns of the adolescent psyclie.
Sonic years ago. a movie called
Blue Denim portra_ved the loss
of innocence. but it refused to
he candid about the process.
Thus. a baby was somehow cre-
ated. an abortion was somehow
aborted. and all was somehow
made well. The film was inaud-
lin and naive. and its explana-
tion of. the mysteries of sex
would have outraged any self"-
respecting stork. -

If Summer of ‘42 must be
faulted, it is in this regard. Her-
mie’s hegira is a bit less stormy,
a bit more leave-it to beavery
than was yours or mine. We are
left to guess at Hermie’s sleep-
less nights, hopes and fears. I

Raucher might have taken us
inside Hermie for a glimpse of
his torment. rather than force
us to infer it from the plot. His
more gentle approach and the
too lush music of Michel Le-
grand suggest not enough of
Hermie's anguish or isolation.

The film. in fact. does little
to merit its "R“ rating. The pro-
fanit_v is perfunctory and mild.
and the sole love-making scene
is decidedly unerotic. though it
is perhaps the most intense.
mesmeric encounter of any con.-
temporary film.

In a‘ more profound way,
though, the film is unsuitable
for the whole family. Only those
who have left their own Her-
mies behind will understand it.

l)irector Robert .\lulligan
makes excellent use of sea mists
and selzery waves to bathe

the summer in streaiiis of rever-
ie. These shimmering shots of
sand and sea coupled with the
anonymity of the cast suspend
the .picture in time and place.
allowing each of us to read his
own past into the script.

Rancher. .\lulligan. and cast
have returned to us a piece of
ourselves. Summer of '42 is ex-
quisite pain. a shaft of bitter-
sweet memory illuminating for
.a moment our own kingdoms by
the sea. where we played out the
days of childliood_ and became
men.

Following a review of the
People’s Oakland Plan, the ar-
chitectural firm of Dee/ter, Rit-
chey and Sippel, developers of

Some vague mention of

from that. his character lies fal-

tatives asserted that Forbes Field
was salvageable and said that
several private developers had
expressed interest in their pro-
posal. They also askedfthat an
independent architect review
their proposal and the Forbes

And that flaws the film con-
siderably. We are told at the
outset that much of the dia-

Smith In, Johnson Out As Assistants

By VINCE DiNARDO

_ Albert E. Smith. who was
 appointed as the first black ad-
ministrative assistant to Casmir
— Myslinski last week. has appar-
 ently found a home here in Pitts-
 burgh in both Monroeville and

with Pitt's Black Action Society.

Richard Utley. chairman of
the B.A.S. seemed eleated at
'Smith's appointment.

"I feel that the athletic de-
partment needed Al Smith.“ he
said. "I'm sure Al can do the
job. if they let him do his job.

 Now the black athlete has some-
 one to relate to in the adminis-
 trative end of the department. I
 think it's more than a step in
the direction."

It was the B.A.S. in the first
 place, in conjunction with some
' alumni‘, and students (both black
and white). This group took at
least ten interviews then made
 four recommendations to Mys-
 linski, who finalized the deci-
‘ ’.sion.

 

Speculation as to Smith's spe-
cific duties still looms. but a
reassignment of duties ‘could
( take place before Smith assum-
g; es his office.
"I think what he (Myslinski)
 has in mind for Smith is to
'-"..l.’.‘carr_\' out his projects." said
~~-Dean Billick. the schools sports
--. information director. "He will
'1 not be a figurehead. but will
"N-Wserve in administering Myslin-

  

ski‘s decisions. Basically. he will
be concerned with the funda-
mental duties of the athletic de-
partment." continued Billick.

Mel Cratsley, who is one of
Myslinski’s administrative as-
sistants at present, also seemed
content about Smith.

"I meet with Al on a couple
of occasions." he said. "I was
very impressed. He seemed to
be a well rounded individual
in the field of sports."

Smith was in Pittsburgh last
week. but spent most of his
time house-hunting. "I think he
found a house in the Monroe-
ville area." Billick related.

Utley continued by saying
that Smith could present a new-
image to the department.

‘‘I think Al could change the
old image in the athletic de-
partment here,” said Utley. “The
athletic department still has an
old image carried over from the
forties and fifties. At least,
Smith provides a different im-
age.”

Just as Smiths appointment
was becoming news. Pitt's part-
time assistant graduate assistant
track coach Dennis Johnson told
the Pittsburgh Courier. a local
black newspaper. that he was
resigning from Pitt‘s coaching
staff because as he put it: "The
other athletic department people
were very aloof and sometimes
even slanderous to me. Their

 

 ‘Athletic Director Casmir Myslinski has announced Pitt will hold
 its annual fall football camp this year at the University of Pittsburgh
i_‘f_Johnstow'n campus.

  
 
  
    
 
 

 Pitt will open fall drills at Johnstown on Aug. 20 with an afternoon
 session. The squad will drill twice daily through Aug. 31 and then re-
turn to the main campus for drills in Pitt Stadium. Sept. 1.

For a number of years, Pitt has heldrits fall camp drills at Alle-
gheny College in Meadville, Pa. The Pitt-Johnstown campus, however,
offers newly completed dormitories and two large playing fields. In
4 addition, Pitt officials view the move as an excellent opportunity to pro-
‘mote one of Pitt's branch campuses.

Approximately 75-80 athletes will be on hand. including 21 re-

L turning lettermen from last years 5-5 team.

opinions of black athletes was
negative especially if a black
athlete didn‘t stay in his place."

Johnson also charged that he
was underpaid compared to oth-
er assistants. and that Myslinski
was not sensative to the needs
of black athletes.

B.A.S.’s Utley went on to say
that; “I can understand what
Dennis meant about others be-
ing aloof towards blacks, I've
experienced it sometimes—Ut-
ley is a black track athlete—but
as far as the other things, I
don't know the facts.”

The facts. according to Billick
and the athletic department. are
that Johnson didn"t resign but
that his contract ran out and
wasn't being renewed.

"Johnson was hired last Oc-
tober for an eight month per-
iod." said Billack. "His contract
ran out at the end of May."

The facts bare Billick and
the athletic Department out.

ROGER McG|l.L, associate trainer at Pitt, has been chosen to serve
on the United States team competing in the Pan American Olympic
Games being held in Cali, Columbia, later this summer. He is
the first trainer in Pitt history to receive such an honor.

McGill, a past president of the Eastern Athletic Trainer's Associa-
tion, is among nine trainers elected from across the country to ac-
company the team, which begins competition on July 30 running
through August 13. His chief responsibility will be handling the

A veteran trainer, McGill has had 21 years of experience both
on college and on the professional level. He was head trainer of
the Pittsburgh Steelers for five years, worked with the Pirates in
spring training and handled the Los Angelas Lalrers and other pro-
fessional basketball teams that came to Pittsburgh.

 

   

On March 3rd. Johnson wrote
Myslinski that he would like to
be retained. Johnson was noti-
fied March 8th that he would
not be so. and ten days before
his contract ran out. Johnson
sent a letter of resignation to
Myslinski. and went to the Cou-
rier.

"I thought the story was very

misleading and . innacurate."
said Billick. "He wasn't paid
commencer with other assis-

tants. That‘s like comparing or-
anges and apples. He was a part
time graduate assistant—As Rod
Fedorchak is in football—whi1e
the other assistants were full
time assistant coaches. He was
paid equally with the other
graduate assistants."

"I'm not trying to say that
Johnson didn't do a good job.
he did according to Banner. but
it's just a matter of position. A
black track graduate of the Uni-
versity is being considered pre-
sently for the position on either
a part or full time basis. When
Johnson was hired. other
thoughts were already being
given to his position."

“The whole thing was a mis-
leading picture of a racial prob-
lem here that doesn’t exist,”
Billick went on to say.

This past week. athletic dir-
ector Casmir Myslinski has been
attending a meeting of the Big

Four (Pitt. Penn State. West
Virginia. Syracuse) at Syracuse
University. The meeting is the
third in three years and also has
the head football and basketball
coaches of each university pre-
sent. Among other things they
will dlSCUSS problems that the
athletic department has. as well
as a possible forming of a six
team conference. including the
four teams. Also. more func-
tions among the four schools will
be discussed. 4

During the past year. Big
Four competition was held in
track. Golf. and Tennis. A wid-
ening of thecompetition to all
sports will also be discussed.

For example, Pitt meets both
West Virginia and Penn State
twice on the basketball schedule.
It is possible that soon, Pitt will
also meet Syracuse on a home
and home basis.

Discussion will also be lent to.

limiting the number of athletic
scholarships to 100 in football
and 24 in basketball over a four
year period.

There has been a lot of talk
in the N.C.A.A. about this late-
ly about scholarship limitations
and it could become a reality
soon. , /

There is talk of permitting
freshmen to compete in var-
sity sports, which would further
cut down the number of neces-
sary scholarships.

Pitt Squads Score

Winning Year Again

For the last two years. Pitt
sports have been on the upswing.
For the first time in 12 years.
Pitt‘s 13 intracollegiate teams
have put together back-to-back
winning seasons.

Last year. the 13 teams com-
piled 81 wins. 63 losses. and
two ties. This year. the effort
was slightly less productive. but
a winning season nonetheless. To-
gether. the teams amassed 77
wins. 72 losses and one tie.

All the teams. it seems, have
had outstanding years. Coach Bob-

by Lewis‘ baseball team has

led both the winning years in total
number of victories. This year.
Lewis‘ mitters compiled 18 of the
77 wins. Besides having a fine
year. the mitters boasted a per-
fect game from their pitching
staff. Also. Ken Macha finished
in the nation's top ten hitters with
a .415 batting mark.

Both Macha and Mike Fedoris
will be back next year. Fedoris
pitched the perfect game.

Coach Buzz Ridl and his basket-
ball team turned in their first
winning record since the 1964
team. The Cager's 14-10 mark top-
ped by two games last year's
mark of 12-12.

Ridl will have a lot to look for-
ward to next year too. He is count-
ing heavily on the return of Cleve-
land Edwards to the court. Ed-
wards. two years ago. set and
holds the all-time Pitt record in
assists. Unfortunately. he missed
last years action with a back in-
jury.

Kent Scott, Paul O’Gorek, Ed_

Harrison, Carl Norris, Bill Sul-
kowski; Chris Jones v and L Marv

Abrams all saw action ‘last year
and will be back again this year.

Bill Knight. Mickey Martin. Jim
Bolla. Sam Fleming and Ken
Wagoner will also move up
from the highly successful fres-
man team coached by Tim Gur-
gherich.

The wrestling team. torn apart
by injuries most of the season still
managed to gather eight wins
with only three losses and one
tie.

The rest of the breakdown
goes like this: football. 5-5; cross-
country. 2-0: soccer. 8-4; gym-
nastics. 2-8: swimming. 3-7 : in-
door track. 1-0; rifle. 5-9; tennis.
2-13; and golf, 8-5.

Pitt Rated
6th Most

Imp roved

A recent article in Basketball
Weekly Magazine ranks Pitt the
sixth most improved basketball
team in the country. as a result
of last years 14-10 record. It also
gave the Panthers a final ranking
of 74th in the country. putting
them ahead of such schools as
LSU 176). Maryland (83) and
West Virginia (86). At the begin-‘
ning of the season. Pitt was rank-
ed 150th.

Under Coach Buzz Ridl. the
Panthers have shown steady im-
provement. going 12-12 two
seasons ago and having their first
winning record since 1964 last‘

Credit Card Education:

No Sale, Char,2*es Pitt

by MARLENE ZNOY

In recent years, credit cards
have successfully invaded the
fields of commercial sales. din-
ing. travel and transportation.
Some innovators are currentl_v at-
tempting to introduce credit sys-
tems into another area: the col-
lege campus.

Credit cards are already be-
ing used at a number of colleges
throughout the country. includ-
ing Ohio State University. Stu-
dents at these institutions use
school identification cards to
charge such expenses as tuition.
housing fees. books. and concert
tickets.

Edison Montgomery, Vice Chan-
cellor of Finance, feels that the
concept of using credit cards at a

JIM MORRISON, the lead sing-
er of the Doors, was found
dead in the bathtub of his Par-
is apartment July 3.

There were no signs of vio-
lence nor any indication that
drugs were involved, said Par-

university is a “terrible idea"
from the standpoint of both the
university, which must pay a fee
to the organization running the
credit card system, and the stu-
dent, who must begin repaying
the charges within 30 days at an
interest rate sometimes higher
than one per cent.

Albert Kirk. assistant manager
of the University Book Center.
recalls that the installation of a
credit system at the book store
was considered a few years ago
but was not regarded as feasible
atthe time.

Kirk noted that the adoption of
such a system would be not only
costly. because of the collection
charges, but time consuming as
well for both the Book Center and
the students.

l

“It's bad enough just taking
checks and cash,” he commented.
“can you imagine what it would
be like in September if we had to
look up accounts, too?”

Kirk said that at the present
time the only books sold on credit
are to those students with student
loans. The Office of Student Ac-
counts guarantees the credit for
these exchanges.

The newly founded position of

MARTI MOORE
New Career Information Specialist
Her duties include counseling
those who have no definite plans
and to advise undergraduates on
their careers.

Moore, who has received her B.A

ment Service for two years. Her
former duties included aiding
graduating seniors as well as grad-
uate students in finding jobs,
writing resumes and interviewing.

“Too many students walk into
the Placement Office after four
years of college not knowing yet
what they want to do.“ Moore
said.

The new advisor designated a
"career planning newsletter“ as
one of her goals. It would feature
various careers. provide new
ideas to “lost" students. and it
would inform students of tthe
character and types of jobs avail-
able.

In conjunction with Teddi Fak-
les, counselor-librarian of the
Center, Moore will be planning
more Career Seminars similar to
those traditionally held in Octo-
ber and February and hopes to ex-
pand the center’s library resources
as well as its graduate school
counseling.

Several career encounter
groups are being planned and or-
ganized by Counseling Center
and College of Arts and Sciences
Advisors.

“If Harrisburg cuts appropria-

accordingly,” Montgomery said.

Should a delay in passage of
the tax forces the State into bank-

"Pitt would continue to borrow
money as it did last year." =
