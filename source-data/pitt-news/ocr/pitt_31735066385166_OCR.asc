Playboy photographer seeks campus models

By Mark Brown

Contributing Editor

Although many American men»

don't know it, David Chan has
been bringing them beautiful
women for over 20 years.
Chan is a centerfold pho-
tographer for Playboy magazine.
He is in Oakland for the rest of
the week to interview and select
three or four women from Pitt to

appear in next April's ”Girls of
the Big East Conference” photo
feature.

”|’ll meet a hundred or so
women. Of them, three or four
will get photographed,” said
Chan, who has been on the pho-
to staff of Playboy for the past 22
years.

Chan explained that 500 to
600 photos are taken of each
woman in order to get one shot

that makes her look her best.
Retouching on a photo can
eliminate scars, birthmarks,
stretchmarks, or make a woman
appear slimmer. Chan told how
changes in lighting, angles, drap-
ing and lenses are used to make
a woman more attractive. ”The
first hour, most women are a bit
nervous. Then they relax,” said
Chan. i
Chan's fiancee travels with him

on photo assignments and per-
forms the make-up work and hair
styling. When asked where the
shots would be taken, he joked,
”Your apartment.”

Fees paid to women whose
photos appear in Playboy are
$100 for a clothed photo, $250
for a semi-nude, $500 for a nude,
and centerfolds receive $15,000.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon celebrates 75th anniversary

By Adam W. Richter

For The Pitt News

In celebration of its 75th an-
niversary, Sigma Alpha Epsilon is
planning an alumni event to coin-
cide with Pitt’s homecoming.

Dave Vaxmonsky, the current
SAE president, said a banquet
was held in March at the LeMont
restaurant at which over 100 ac-
tive members and alumni were
present to honor the fraternity. In-
cluded were William Chapman,
the eminent supreme warden of
the fraternity, and Jack Freeman,
the executive vice president at

Pitt. Freeman, Vaxmonsky said,
helped in getting the fraternity
houses built up on the hill away
from the neighborhood where,
Vaxmonsky claims, they would
be subject to vandalism.
According to Vaxmonsky, the
brotherhood of SAE is very
diverse. ”You can't really place
a label on our house,” he states.
The fraternity currently has the
third-highest QPA and «the
second-largest membership.
SAE is also involved in many
community services. They
worked on the'Phipps Conserva-
tory Fright Night last year and this

year and are very active in the
Special Olympics.

Vaxmonsky feels that SAE is a
respected fraternity and is very
visible on campus. ’’All of our
brothers wear their letters, and
they wear them proudly,” he
claims.

In addition, SAE is a respected
fraternity nationwide, Vax-
monsky said.

”We set precedents that are fol-
lowed by other fraternities.”

SAE was originally founded
March 9, 1856, at the University
of Alabama by Noble Leslie

DeVotie as a social fraternity. In
1913, Marvin E. Holderness start-
ed a chapter at the University of
Pittsburgh, according to Vax-
monsky.

Vaxmonsky joined SAE be-
cause, according to him, ”they
bestow a lot of leadership on

I!

you.

Every year, SAE celebrates
Founder's Day on the weekend
closest to March 9. This year, the
banquet was held March 19 to
coincide with the 75th anniver-
sary of the founding of the Pitt
chapter.

City Council puts final veto on gay-righ ts Iegisla tion

By Jason Hillman
Contributing Editor

Despite an impassioned plea
by sponsorMark Pollock, the City
Council rejected gay-rights legis-
lation yesterday in a final vote on
the proposed bill.

The council was deadlocked
4-4, with Pollock, Michelle
Madoff, Michael Coyne and, Jim
Ferlo voting for the bill; and Ben
Woods, Eugene DePasquale, Jack

Wagner and Otis Lyons against it.‘
Pollock opened up discussion .

of the bill by saying that in a Pitts-
burgh media that usually ignores
council meetings, ll editorials

were written on this particular 7

bill.

He addressed what he said
were the seven main objections
to the bill. Pollock, who said he
was the only attorney on the
council, said that legal objections
were nothing but “excuses,”
pointing out that Harrisburg and
Philadelphia already have gay-
rights laws on the books.

”A person couldbe told by city

employment ‘I don't hire faggots,’
and nothing could be done about
it legally,” Pollock said, address-
ing the need for the protection of
gay citizens.
. Pollock also praised the people
who publically supported the bill
and testified at the public hear-
ing. ”They are heroes, true free-
dom fighters,” he said.

Stating that his own religion
was against this bill, Pollock ex-
plained that although he is very
religious, he separates his reli-
gious and political life in this in-
stance. -

Pollock attacked fellow Coun-
cilman Lyons, saying, ”A black

man who says homosexuals don't —

deserve equal rights is like pull-
ing up the ladder on a lifeboat af-
ter he was already saved.” »

Lyons defended himself by say-
ing that he was following the
wishes of his constituents. Wagn-
er argued that there was‘still no
pattern of discrimination against
homosexuals in Pittsburgh. ’’It
hasn't been proven that gays have
a higher [rate of] unemployment
than the general public,” he said.
Wagner also said in the Oct. 6 is-
sue of The Pittsburgh Press that,
”To the contrary, the homosexu-
al community has shown itself to
be quite affluent.”

The lack of viable evidence of
discrimination makes the bill un-
necessary, Wagner said. He also
contested Pollock's belief thatthe
bill was legal.

The board was sharply divided
on this issue. Michelle Madoff,
who said said she attended the
meeting with the flu and a
l01—degree temperature, was re-
buked by acting President Woods

Tractor trailer and bus collision leaves 18 injured

EVERETT, Pa. (AP) —— A tractor-
trailer truck hauling brewer's
grain slammed into the back of a
school bus Monday, injuring 16
students and the two drivers,
authorities said. Four students
were injured seriously.

The bus carried 20 students
aged five through 17 years on
their way to the Everett Area
Elementary School and Everett
Area High School, authorities
said.

Ritchie's 1984 Kenworth
tractor-trailer collided with the
school bus at 7:40 a.m. while
both were traveling north on the
Pennsylvania 26 Bypass, a
modern, two-lane highway in
West Providence Township,
north of Everett and the Pennsyl-
vania Turnpike, state police said.

Edward A. Vollbrecht, superin-
tendent of the Everett Area
School District, saidthe bus was

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -
Communist authorities put more

unspecified ”urgent measures” in
Montenegro’s capital Monday,
but protests fed by economic cri-

Protest has swept much of
southern and eastern Yugoslavia

Investigations lax in
illegal foreign trades

WASHINGTON (AP) —- The
Securities and Exchange Com-
mission has failed to investigate
most reports of suspicious foreign
trading of U.S. securities, despite
a growing number of illegal
trades originating from abroad, a
House panel said Monday.

A report by the Government

rOperations Committee said the

SEC had actively investigated
only 61 of 229 reports from stock
exchanges of suspicious foreign
trades — mostly those appearing
to involve insider trading — in
1986 and 1987.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, October ll, l988

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP)
— New electric, rolling chairs
are a hit with tourists who, un-
til now, were using the tradi-
tional hand—pushed wicker
versions. But angry locals say
the electric carts are causing a
"random riot" on the
Boardwalk. A

The King La Corbliere Elec-
tric Rolling Chair Co. has
proven to be an instant suc-
cess with the public, who find
the chairs a quick and inex-
pensive way to get from one
end of the Boardwalk casino
strip .to the other.

After just three weeks in
operation, the carts are pulling
in as much as $4,000 a day.

But they have also made a
lot of enemies. ’

Atlantic City's two tradition-
al rolling chair companies
have been all but pushed out
of business. Angry merchants
say the chairs endanger pedes-
trians and roll customers past
their doors. Police have issued
speeding tickets to the carts,
clocking them well over the
Boardwalk speed limit of four
mph. (

''It has hurt us bad," said
Larry Belfer, owner of Atlantic
City Famous Rolling Chairs,
the traditional wheeled, wick-

Carts a jackpot in Atlantic City

er contraptions made famous
on the Boardwalk. "Although
these electric carts are a great
source of transportation, there
are other people and liveli-
hoods concerned.”

In July, King La Corbliere
partners Ernest English and
Stuart McGinnis purchased all
100 of the mercantile licenses
under a forgotten ordinance
regulating motorized rolling
chairs. The permits were grant-
ed before city officials found
out what type of vehicle the
partners had in mind.

"They’re golf carts. They're
not rolling chairs," said city
Councilman Arnold Orsatti Jr.

City officials wanted to re-
voke the permits immediately
but decided that arguing over
the ordinance’s vague defini-

T tion of a rolling chair was a

losing proposition.

King La Corbliere started
rolling over the Labor Day
weekend. The company now
puts 60 carts on the boards ev-
ery weekday and 100 on the
weekends. The fare is $1 for a
short ride, $2 for a medium
ride and $3 for the trip from
Showboat Hotel Casino to
Bally’s Grand Hotel & Casino‘.

A ride in a traditional chair
costs $5 to $7 and takes twice

as long. ,

The drivers, who lease the
carts from the company in
three—hour shifts, have little
trouble attracting passengers.

”You can do $300 a day,
easy," said English, who form-
erly pushed the antique wick-
er chairs.

The electric carts move at a
steady clip, fast enough to pass
even the motorized tram. The
carts make no noise and carry
no horns, and English said the
drivers are not permitted to
blow whistles.

"I don't think they're safe,"
Orsatti said. "The Boardwalk
is - mainly a pedestrian
thoroughfare.”

Merchants have complained
to police and City Hall offi-
cials. They say a number of
carts have narrowly missed
pedestrians.

"lt’s a random riot running
all over the Boardwalk every-
where,” said Frank Glaser,
president of the Boardwalk
Merchants Association.

. Meanwhile, the Atlantic City
Famous Rolling Chairs compa-
ny is perhaps the hardest hit.
Many of the men and women
who pushed the historic wick-
er chairs have defected en E
masse to the new operation.

that's why people read Playboy.

Chan, a third-generation
Chinese-Canadian from Vancou-
ver is in love with taking photos.

rHe said that he'd enjoy pho-

tographing food or weddings as
well, but photographing beauti-
ful women is much more fun.

He said that a cross section of
women at Pitt would be sought
to represent who's here. Group
photos on campus with the wom-
en in their clothes will be shot,
while the nude photos are taken
in secluded wooded areas or
apartments. Chan's fiancee —
whom he's been dating for the
past 12 years — or another wom-
an always accompanies him dur-
ing these assignmentsto make
the women feel more comforta-
ble and to dispel negative
rumors.

think the members who opposed

can be discriminated against and
they have condoned it. It's an ab-

The final decisions on who ap-
pears in Playboy is made at its
headquarters in Chicago. Some
women photographed go on to
be Playmates. ”One Playmate of
the Year was 33 years old and

mentioned that women with
large breasts seem to be remem-
bered better than others. "One
woman had hair down to her feet
but [had] small breasts. People

Chan.

Playboy Enterprises has had its
financial ups and downs over the
past few years. Chan said that
most of the clubs operate for only

" Impact of Brawl ey

bad for civil rights

Having found no evidence to support Tawana Brawley’s claim that
she had been kidnapped, raped and abused by a gang of white men
last year, a grand jury officially closed the Brawley case on Thursday
after seven months of investigation. However, the effects of this case

on attitudes about race and justice are likely to linger.

On Sunday, National Islam leader Louis Farrakhan said that
Brawley’s alleged assailants should be killed and dismembered. This
attitude is not only unreasonable, it is dangerous.

Brawley’s attorneys, Alton H. Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon Mason,
contended that the legal system is biased and used the press in an
irresponsible manner to sensationalize this perspective. Maddox and
Mason may now face disciplinary action due to the manner in which
they conducted Brawley’s case. Punitive action would do little at this
point to resolve the damage which has arisen from their lack of profes-

sionalism.

If Brawley did, indeed, fabricate her allegations, her age and im-
maturity could explain her actions. How might her attorneys account
for their behavior? Rather than seeing justice served, these attorneys
seemed more concernedwith gaining publicity for the case and

themselves.

It is important that the public be made aware of racial prejudice
and subsequent violence. However, to take advantage of the sensi-
tivity surrounding the issue in order to legitimize unfounded testimony

is inexcusable.

The manipulation of the media by Maddox and Mason serves to
distract public opinion from other cases of racial violence in which
the victim's allegations are proven valid. In these instances, the
Brawley case might serve to incriminate an actual victim in the public

Charging for speaking on ethics

When former presidential aide
Michael Deaver was indicted on
charges of perjury in connection
with alleged influence peddling,
the independent prosecutor,
Whitney North Seymour Jr., ex-

pressed outrage at what he be-_

lieved to have been the primary
reason for Deaver’s rush to em-
brace temptation: ”There is too
much loose money i in
Washington.”

Apparently Seymour felt com-
pelled to tie up some of those
loose monetary ends. It has been
revealed that this summer, prior
to Deaver’s sentencing, Seymour
sent letters to colleges and univer-
sities offering to speak on
”Washington’s ethics” for fees
ranging from $2,500 to $5,000.
He described his asking price as
”way below market.” The New
York Times editorially suggested
that it was below something else.

The letter, written on his New
York law firm’s stationary, said in
part, ”As a result of my indoctri-
nation [into] the ways of
Washington as independent
counsel, I have developed quite
strong views on how to achieve
a higher standard of ethics in

government.”

When Deaver was indicted,
Seymour also expressed some
”quite strong views” on Deaver’s
ethics and what he viewed as
Deaver’s impropriety. In a ser-
monette delivered to ‘reporters
outside the federal courthouse on
the evils that some men do in the

CAL  
THOMAS

capital city, Seymour said, ”Vast
sums of money are on call to
representatives of major corpora-

tions, defense contractors and for- I

eign governments to buy
influence and favors. Much of
that money is paid to consultants
whose stock in trade is their
friendship with persons in high
office.‘ Washington money men
will continue to undermine pub-
lic confidence in government un-
til lawmakers, business and
community leaders and individu-
al citizens decide to cry,

‘ ’enough.’ ”

OK, ”ENOUGH!”
While he technically has not
broken any laws or violated any

legal ethics code (what this says
about legal standards is another
question), Seymour has violated
standards of propriety. The least
he could have done was to wait
until Deaver was formally sen-
tenced or even until his appeals
have been exhausted. By trying to
cash in on his own notoriety, he
has diminished the strength of his
moral outrage and has shown that
he isn't all that different from
those he has criticized.
Seymour should have been
more sensitive to people's cyni-
cism about the headlines of the
last 18 months which have in-
volved ethical blindness among
politicians and government offi-
cials, Wall Street greed‘ mongers
convicted of insider trading and
a few ministers who use televi-
sion appeals to bankrupt the peo-

ple they are supposed to be ’

serving. I

In his defense, Seymour said
we should look at his fee solici-
tation in another light. ”This is a
way to get a message out to the
future leaders of this country, that
they ought to be doing something
about improving the level of
ethics in the nation's capital,”

Subject of nuclear power needs more explanation

William Young's op-ed piece
on nuclear power (”Don't be
afraid: nuclear power is safe and
economical," Oct. 5) brings up
several good points, but misses
the source of many anxieties on
nuclear power. ,

Undoubtedly, Mr. Young had
seen the reports that the Savan-

. nah River nuclear facility in South

Carolina had developed many
(30) minor‘ to severe problems
over the last 25 years or so which
were unreported to the Depart-
ment of Energy. DOE later re-
vised this stance to state that they
had received reports of the many
hazards, they just sort of mis-
placed them and told the press
otherwise before thoroughly
checking. Human error once
again. Granted, ‘most of the inci-
dents were not life—threatening,
but some had the capacity to be-
come quite fatal for all surround-
ing residents. 

Mr. Young also states that ”...
France has the largest number of
nuclear reactors per square mile,
and no Frenchmen are around
complaining. ...” which is entire-
ly true, and points a finger direct-
ly at the problems eating away at

the nuclear industry. People and
money. In order to turn a profit,
the managers hire fewer people
at cheaper rates and ask them to
work longer hours. If an example
needs to be seen, look at the sto-
ry of Karen Silkwood, who at-
tempted to bring the problems
with the management at the
nuclear plant where she worked
to the federal government's atten-
tion but died in a car accident be-
fore she could do so.

Mr. Young is also correct in
stating that it goes ”...without say-
ing that if Americans were better
educated on the subject of
nuclear energy, they would be
less afraid of it. ...” But if people
were better educated on it, they
would also be far more question-

ing. The same goes with such.

travesties as South Africa. If peo-
ple were better educated on
nuclear waste, they might begin
to wonder what happens to the
people who live here after this
generation kicks off.

Ahh yes, waste, the subject
skirted around by Mr. Young with
the flippant ”...the space shuttle
could send such material on a
collision course with the sun. ...”

LETTERS

We have enough of a problem
‘even getting the space shuttle up, I
period, notwithstanding the fact
that they would have to be going
up far more often to get rid of all
the waste we put out now. And
this still doesn't mention the
waste which is in the ground at
this time. The people of Love
Canal are_fina|ly able to move
back into their homes, if they so
desire, after 10 years of intensive
cleanup from the waste of 210
chemical dumpsites within 50
miles of their city.

The problems in the nuclear in-
dustry exist, not so much in the
atoms being utilized, or in the
equipment being used, but in the
people manipulating each.

What about Dukakis?

Editor's note: The following let-
ter is in response to lessica Co -
vi/Ie’s column, “Disturbing facts
abOUt Quavle,” in the Wednes-

day, Oct. 5 issue of The Pitt
News. .

This article amazes me! Are we
supposed to be impressed by the
fact that you and your friend were
discussing the candidates in the
honors college, Jessica?

Let me guess, you were mere-
ly a visitor there. Any reasonably
intelligent person would see that
you used the typical Dukakis ap-
proach [to] politics, and avoided
discussing his platform. Instead
you have resorted to the childish
technique of ”Bush is bad. I don't
like what Reagan did. So any-
one’s gotta be better, I guess; let's
give Dukakis a try. He speaks En-
glish.”-Be serious for a minute
here; it was never mentioned in
your article what Dukakis stands
for. What Bush and Quayle stand
for was addressed at some length:
this says quite a bit about them
doesn’t it?

Tell me something, is Dukakis’
expertise at evading the issues
and lack of answers what we
need in office? And as for your
comment about what will we do
if Quayle is president, it is a little

premature. First, you'd have to
cast your vote for Bush as presi-
dent. Then he'd have to leave the
scene, not likely.

The Pitt News has commented
on Bush's support of saying the
pledge of allegience [sic] in the
schools. Wouldn't we all rather
elect a president who will reduce
military spending; hence some
government makes it so we aren't
even allowed to say the pledge of
allegience [sic]?

I, for one, can't see where I'd
trust someone who wouldn't
pledge their devotion to our
country's founding ideals. What's
Du(tax)us going to do if he is
elected,’ refuse to say the oath?
With these thoughts I leave you,
and request that The Pitt News
better represent all of the views
of the community it serves, and
whose support keeps it in publi-
cation. The media, I feel, is
responsible for presenting the
facts and the issues, and leaving
the bias to its readers.

  Pitt soccer team moves
to 4-4 after last week,
getting ready for CMU

By Mike Rampa
Staff Writer
The soccer team is 4-4 this

week after last Wednesday's 1-0
win over Canisius College, and

_ Friday's loss to'Ca|ifornia State

University in overtime 2-1.

The Cal State contest resem-
bled Pitt's last overtime game
against Bucknell + 90 minutes of
intense defense. ,

The lone Panther goal was
scored by Heinz Pak, his third of
the season, on a bullet into the

. upper corner of the net. Pak is the

team's leading scorer, and he has
proven to be an extremely versa-
tile player.

.Pak started the season as a mid-
fielder, as Coach Joe Luxbacher
hoped touse Pak’s natural left-
footed kicking ability to produce
a more potent attack.

Recently, Pak has shifted to
sweeper as Dan Liberati has
moved up to the midfield. Pak fits
in well with the Panther defense,
the team's strongest area, ‘be-
cause he played sweeper for
Community College of Alleghe-
ny County last season before
transferring to Pitt. He has
produced on both offense and
defense, and Luxbacher is reap-
ingthe benefits of this 21-year-old
recruit.

Against Canisius College, Scott
Armstrong scored the only Pan-
ther goal which proved to be the
game winner.

1 Tomorrow night, the battle of
Oakland gets underway at 7:15
in/side Pitt Stadium as the Pan-
thers take on Carnegie Mellon
University. The Panthers bowed
to the Tartans last year by a score
of 1-0. CMU currently has a
three-year winning streak against

Pitt.

CMU’s most dangerous offen-
sive threat is Ed Park, a junior for-
ward out of Roanoke, Va..
Already, he posts impressive stats
after 10 games with 10 goals and
three assists. With 23 points, Park
leads the President's Conference.

In their last game, the Tartans

, downed Grove City by a tally of

4-1 as Park scored all four goals.
That puts him atop CMU’s record
book for most goals and most
points in a game. Stopper Jon
Ascher and the rest of the Panther
defense will have their hands full
trying-to shut down this scoring
machine.

Also providing effective offense
for CMU is midfielder Rob
Schaeffer, who has 12 points
(three goals, six assists). Freshman
Young Kang, also a midfielder,
also has 12 points going into
tomorrow night's contest.

CMU-V keeper Glenn Hloger-
werf will try to hold down the fort
in goal in an attempt to improve
his already impressive 1.41 goals
against average.

Nick Gaudioso is in his eighth
year as head coach of the Tartans
as he brings his team to the other
side of Fifth Avenue. 1

The Tartans are 5-4-1 in the
season.

Luxbacher hopes to accom-
plish something that has been
plaguing his team all season,
scoring. The Panthers have had
problems finishing on goal all

”The Cal State game was a
clear case of a team playing ex-
cellent soccer and losing,” Lux-
bacher said. ”We should have
scored five goals in that game.

Women ’s swim team very happy
with incoming recruiting class

By Kelly Witt
Staff Writer

The 1988-89 Pitt women’s
swmming and diving team has
one of the most talented incom-
ing freshman classes that Coach
Dave Belowich has ever seen.

”l believe they're as talented a
freshman class [as] we've ever
had here at Pitt, and that says a
lot,” Belowich said.‘

”They’re definitely dedicated
and very hard working. They
have gotten themselves together
very quickly, and the whole team
works well together.”

Freshman Janine Atiyeh agrees.
”lt’s working out really well. It's
hard, but you have to hang in
there. It's fun though, very team-
oriented,” she said.

Atiyeh is a backstroke recruit
from Allentown, Pa., and some-
one Belowich said he's glad to
have on the team. ”She’s had a
tremendous summer at Junior
Nationals, knocking six seconds
off her time,” he said. .

Atiyeh was also a state finalist
in the backstroke.

Another freshman recruited for
her backstroke, as well as her in-

dividual medley and breast
stroke, is Laura-Lee Sullivan of
Rochester, N.Y. ”She’s as talent-
ed an individual as we've had in
any stroke,” Belowich said.

Belowich also has two other
new swimmers with similar
qualifications. One is Mary
Caspero, a transfer from Towson
State in Michigan, who also
swims the individual medley and
breast stroke. W

”Mary is working hard and do-
ing a good job,” Belowich said.

The other is Debbie Bardzil
from Peter's Township. Bardzil
swims the individual medley,
breast stroke and butterfly.

"Debbie's very versatile; she'll
add some good depth and a lot
of potential,” Belowich said.

The highlight of the incoming
class, however, is breast stroker
Karin Masal, who participated in
the Olympic trials. ”She’s obvi-
ously a very talented individual.
It's good to have her,” Belowich
said.

Masal is glad to be here too.
’’It’s going pretty well. I'm enjoy-
ing it. It's completely different at
first. It's hard to adjust. Your
teammates are there to encourage

you. It helps a lot,” she said.

Coming in to fill the open spots
in butterfly are Sue Baker from
Baldwin and Noelle Barry from
Charlotte, N.C. Belowich said
both women have good tech-
nique and a solid stroke.

Barry also swims the individu-
al medley. ”She’s a good talent.
She's young; she'll only be 18 in
December. Noelle is developing
and has already done quite well,”
Belowich said.

Caroline Day from Milford,
Conn., will be helping out with
distance freestyle. ”She has not
even come close to reaching her
potential. Her times stabilized in
high school and she always
swam the same way, at a very
consistent speed. Not any more.
She picked up the system really
well. Often, a change makes you
free to start over and get better,"
Belowich noted.

In the freestyle sprints,
Christine Gallagher from Park-
side, Pa., and walk-on Kate Gan-
non will be helping out.

Gallagher is a state finalist in
the 50- and 100-yard freestyles,
and she was the fastest sprinter in

Men '5 swim team gets
ready for '88 season

By Andy Gould
For The Pitt News

The Pitt men ’s swim team is
looking toward another Big
East title for the seventh year
in a row. Ever since Pitt has
competed in the Big East con-
ference, it has taken the title.

This year, with the likes of
promising freshmen and many
returning superstars, the Pitt
team is looking toward the
Eastern Seaboard Champion-
ships in the spring.

in the past three years that
the team has entered the
Eastern Championships, they
have received only fourth-
place honors. This year, they
are looking to become cham-
pions but must get past
defending champion, Ivy
Leaguer Harvard.

The 1988 team has many
bright points that weren't
found on the team last year.
Head coach Dick Bradshaw
and his colleagues did exten-
sive recruiting over this past
summer. They gained sprinter
Matt Porter from New York

and backstrokers Fred Con-
stentini from Florida and Eric
Mattsen of Delaware. Other
hopeful freshmen include dis-
tance swimmer Dave Schep-
ner, who is from the Pittsburgh
area, and breast strokers Carl
Valentine from Philadelphia,
and Allentown’s Brian De-
terick.

Assistant coach Rob Ready,
a graduate student, said,
”With these young swimmers,
our team will be very hard to
beat in the Big East.”

Along with Ready, Brad-
shaw has by his side assistant
coach Bob Clemorand gradu-
ate assistant Charles Learch.
Bradshaw has been with the
university since 1971, and has
guided the team to six straight
Big East titles. He has been
regarded by many as the most
knowledgeable aquatic coach
in the country. As he begins
the 1988 campaign, he has a
total of 24 returning upper-
classmen, seven divers and 17
freshmen.

_Gibson puts Dodgers up one game in series  

n

t0

By Jim Donaghy

AP Sports Writer

NEW YORK — Rookie Tim
Belcher won his second game of
the playoffs, and Kirk Gibson hit
his second straight game-winning
homer, as Los Angeles beat the
New York Mets 7-4 in Game 5 on
Monday to move within one
game of their first National
League pennant since 1981.
The teams now fly to Los An-
geles, where the Dodgers can
wrap up the best—of-seven series
Tuesday when former Met Tim
Leary opposes David Cone, the
losing pitcher in Game 2.
During the regular season, the
Mets won 10 of 11 games from
the Dodgers and won 56 games
at home, including their last 11
at Shea Stadium. But the Dodg—
ers came into New York to win
two of three and take a 3-2 lead.

The Dodgers won Game 4 in .

12 innings on Gibson's homer

shortly before 1 a.m. EDT. A lit- 1

tle less than 12 hours later, the
two teams were back on the field
for the fifth game with the series
tied at two games apiece.

The Mets and Dwight Gooden F

were three outs away from taking
a 3-1 lead in the series when
Mike Scioscia tied the score with
a two—run homer.

Gibson, who ended a 1-for-16
slump with his game—winning
homer in Game 4, hit a three-run
shot in the fifth inning for his sec-
ond homer in a little over 12
hours. 1

With two outs in the ninth,
Gibson beat out an infield hit,
then appeared to reinjure his left
hamstring stealing second and
left the game. Jose Gonzalez ran
for Gibson and scored the Dodg—
ers’ seventh run when Mike Mar-
shall tripled to right-center.

In all five games, the Dodgers
have scored first, this time break-
ing through for three runs off
loser Sid Fernandez in the fourth
inning on 39-year-old Rick
Dempsey’s two—run double and
an RBI double by Alfredo Griffin.

Belcher, who won Game 2, set
down nine straight before Len

' Dykstra led off with a walk in the

fourth and Gregg Jefferies singled.
Belcher, who won nine of his
last 11 decisions, allowed seven
hits and struck out six as he be-
came the first rookie to win two
games in the playoffs since the
format was adopted in 1969.
In Game 2, Belcher allowed
five hits in eight 1-3 innings as the
Dodgers beat the Mets 6-3.

ties. With an open net, we hit the
post from three yards out. There's
no excuse for that.”

There may be a few minor
changes in the Panther |ine—up,
simply to try and get the guys up
onto the line who are capable of
putting the ball in the net. There
have been countless breakaways,
shots and penalty kicks that have
not been netters all season.

Luxbacher does not plan to do
anything drastic or special going
into the game. He plans to try to
nullify their dangerous offensive
players (which is done every
game), let the line create chances
(which has happened every
game), and he would like to see
controlled soccer (which has oc-
curred at different points in every
game). He would really like to
see some goals.

 

Marshall led off the fourth with
a single and, after a walk to John
Shelby, Dempsey doubled down
the left-field line on a high
fastball.

Dempsey was signed as a non-
roster player last spring by the
Dodgers after hitting .177 for
Cleveland in 1987. He missed
the last half of 1987 after suffer-
ing a broken thumb in a collision
at home plate with Kansas City’s
Bo Jackson.

As a catcher for Baltimore in
1983, Dempsey was the World
Series MVP and is 20—for-61 in 21
postseason games.

Griffin, a .167 batter hitting
right-handed, followed Demp-
sey’s hit with a double to left-
center field.

Steve Sax led off the fifth with
a single and moved to third on
Mickey Hatcher’s hit—and—run sin-
gle to right field. Gibson led the

Dodgersvwith 25 home runs, then
hit a drive into the right—fie|d seats
to chase Fernandez.

Fernandez, who won his last
six games to; finish 12-10, al-
lowed seven hits and six runs in
five-plus innings. During the sea-
son, he was 8-4 at home with a
1.83 earned-run average.

Fernandez was given a start in
the playoffs because of an injury
to Bob Ojeda, whose left middle
finger was almost severed in a
gardening accident 10 days be-
fore the end of the season.

The Mets got back into the
game in the fifth when Howard
Johnson led off with a single to
snap an 0-for-14 streak in this ser-

I ies and O—for—22 overall in post-

season competition. The slump

tied pitcher George Earnshaw's
mark for postseason futility.

Wally Backman followed with
an infield single and, one out
later, Dykstra homered into the
right-field bullpen.

New York chased Belcher in
the eighth. Dykstra led off with a
double and scored on Jefferies’
single, his seventh hit in 19 at-
bats in the series. Left-hander
Ricky Horton relieved Belcher
and struck out Keith Hernandez,
‘then yielded a single to Darryl
Strawberry and right—hander Bri-
an Holton was called in to face
Kevin McReynolds.

McReynolds hit a slow ground-
er to short, and Jefferies’ was
called out when the ball hit him
as he ran to third. McReynolds

wasncredited with a single, but i

the out cost the Mets a scoring
opportunity. Gary Carter ended"
the inning by_flying to left.

Holton pitched the ninth for
the save.

The Dodgers used seven pitch-
ers in Game 4, including
23-game winner Orel Hershiser,
who got the final out. Hershiser

warmed up in the bullpen in the

eighth, when Mets

the
threatened. '

Monday's game was the sec- .

ond for the Dodgers without their

relief ace, Jay Howell, who was

suspended for three days after be-
ing ejected from Saturday's game
for having pine tar on his glove.
The suspension was reduced on
Monday by a day, making
Howell available for Game 6.

Matheis is easily recognizable:
she is the player with the ever-
present smile.

It seems contagious. Her play
over the last two years has
brought smiles to her teammates
and her coach, Shelton Collier.

Matheis has shown" remarkable
improvement in her playing abil-

ity since coming to Pitt in 1986:

from North Hills High School,
where she was a two-sport stan-

vania Interscholastic Athletic
League first team all-star in
volleyball, Matheis was not
recruited by an NCAA Division-I
school

”Kel|y’s final choices as far as
continuing to play collegiate
volleyball [were either] being a
star at Carlow or making an at-
tempt to play big—time volleyball
at Pitt,” recalled Collier.

For Matheis, the decision to at-

play. It was really exciting, and I
thought, ‘Wouldn't it be awe-
some to play here,’ ” she said.

Matheis’ freshman year was
one of transition. She played very
little for the Lady Panthers. In-
stead of getting frustrated and
quitting, Matheis became more
determined than ever to prove
herself as a player.

”The summer before my
sophomore year, I worked really

She had improved to the point
of being a starter on last year's
37-6 team at the outside hitter po-
sition. Matheis totaled I67 kills
for the season and at the end of
the season was selected by her
teammates as the Lady Pan-
thers”’most improved player.”

One of her teammates, middle-
blocker Nora Mulvihill, reflected
on her improvement as a player:
’’Kelly is 150 percent better to-
day. She came in as a freshman

The dramatic improvement by
Matheis’ earned the praise of her
coach.

”Kelly has shown as much im-
provement and determination as
any player I have ever coached
at Pitt. She's progressed from a
frail high school player with lit-
tle confidence to a strong, highly
respected team leader and often-
times a dominant collegiate play-
er,” observed Collier.

the state to graduate. Gallagher
was one of the first recruits to de-
cide to come to Pitt.

”|t’s nice to have a good
sprinter to build a recruiting class
around. Christine is one of
those,” said Belowich.

Although Belowich didn't

Decruit Gannon, he said he is
delighted to have her on the
team. ”Kate is one of the most
together people I have ever met.
She's proceeding very nicely as
a sprint freestyler and will add a
lot to the program. She will
definitely be a contributor," Be-
lowich said.

In addition to the swimmers,
there are two new divers, one a
recruit and one a transfer student.

The recruit is Mindy Hennon
from Oakdale, Pa. She has been
a part of diving coach Julian

Q<rug's club program. ”She’s very

good and very solid,” Belowich
said.

Krissa Ratliff is a junior transfer
from Eagan, Minn. Ratliff is a
world class trampolinist, and ac-

cording to Belowich, one of the
best divers to have bounced on
the boards at Pitt.

Belowich’s incoming talent is
sure to raise some eyebrows in
the swimming circles of the east.
But will they gain notoriety this
year, next year, or four years
down the road?

”Overall, this makes us very
young,” said Belowich. ”The fu-
ture of the program is in really
good hands.”

Although Belowich is pleased
with his freshman class, he stress-
es that it is not four separate class-
es, but one team.

”The senior captains, Tricia
Rickert and Maureen Cleary, are
doing a fine job in showing the
freshmen what to do. The four
classes are meshing together very
quickly,” Belowich said.

Atiyeh agrees. ”|t’s a big
change being a freshman again.
This is more team—oriented. The
upperclassmen support us a lot
and help when we have trouble
adjusting,” she said.

Sacca not just a regular
freshman at Penn State

I» .
By Ralph Berstein _

AP Sports Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — Penn
State coach Joe Paterno gets an-
noyed when the media try to
make a star out of freshman quar-
terback Tony Sacca.

Sacca, one of the most highly
recruited high school players in

' ‘he country, directed Penn State

to a 35-9 victory Saturday over
the Cincinnati Bearcats.

It was the 6-foot-5-inch Sacca’s
second victory since succeeding
the injured Tom Bill three weeks
ago.

He completed 11 of 33 for I 78
yards and two touchdowns as
Penn State boosted its record to
4-1. He also was sacked four
times.

After the game, the media
pressed Paterno to talk about his
young passer.

"He's just a kid," Paterno said.
”He’s not Superman. There's no
‘S’ there unless he's got under-
wear marked Sacca.

0- "He learned a lot today [Satur-

day]. He learned that he's got to
concentrate when guys are open.
”He learned he's going to be
knocked on his rear end when he
runs out of the pocket and
doesn't have to.
’’That’s the only reason I left
him in there as long as I did,” said
' Paterno, whose team led 35-2 at
halftime. "I wanted him to get as
much work. We repeated passes.

awe wanted to make sure he gets

the feel of a couple of more plays
each week. I think he made
progress. It was a good game for
him."

If it's October, Paterno's foot-
ball team is usually winning.

October has been the most suc-
cessful month in Paterno’s
23-year career at State. His suc-
cess rate in October is 86
percent.

The victory over Cincinnati‘,
was the Nittany Lions’ second

one this October. Penn State
scored all its points in the first
half, then leaned on its defense.

’’I think [in] the second half we
were erratic. We had a lot of peo-
ple open and we missed them. 
You [have] got to start making
some of these catches if you're
throwing the ball as much as
we're throwing.”

The Penn State defense, 19th
best in the nation, shut down the
Bearcats with 123_ yards on the
ground and 129 passing. A lot of
the Cincinnati yardage came late
in the fourth quarter when Penn
State had the game in hand.

The Lions’ defense turned in six
sacks, recovered a fumble and in-
tercepted two passes, converting
both into touchdowns.

The only scores for Cincinnati,
2-3, came on blocked punts, the
first turned into a safety and the
second a TD recovery in the end
zone.

”We made a couple of stupid
mistakes,” Paterno said of the
punt blocks. ’’I think we might
have had the wrong personnel on
the kicking team.

”We kicked the ball and pro-
tected the punter just the way we
practice it.”

The Cincinnati punting game
buried the Bearcats in the first
half. Penn State got possession six
times after punts anywhere from
the Cincinnati 47 to the Penn
State 40.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, October II, 1988

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

PITTSBURGH — The Pittsburgh
Steelers have experienced tough-
er times than these.

For example, financially
strapped owner Art Rooney was
orced to sell two of his best play-
ers, Frank Filchock and Tom Bur-
nette, to meet his payroll. That
was 50 years ago Monday.

The Pittsburgh Steelers, 1-5, are
paying their bills these days, but
they aren't winning any games.
They've lost five in a row for the
first time since they were 1-13 in
1969, and they are in the midst
of playing eight consecutive op-
ponents with winning records.

Coach Chuck Noll said Mon-
day he’s not selling his players
short, but he called the losing

Qstreak ”an embarrassment.”

Team President Dan Rooney
used harsher words during Sun-
day's 31-14 loss in Phoenix, say-
ing, ”We’re pretty close to
bottom right now.

"I thought there were a lot of
guys who tried.  We tried and
didn't look good, and that may
have made it worse,” Rooney
said. ’'I don't know if I'm ready
to be more patient or less patient.
I thought we had a pretty good

'p'.team in training camp, and we've

gotten progressively worse.”

Noll, at his weekly news con-
ference Monday, said the Steel-
ers continue to ”self-destruct with
mistakes, with blown assign-
ments  things we've been [prac-
ticing] for three years.

”|s it embarrassing? Yeah, and
it's no fun, either,” Noll said.

l"But that's the way it is right now.

You live with embarrassment or
maybe do something about it.”

Noll didn't promise any radical
line-up changes —-— the Steelers
are down to reserves at many po-
sitions because of injuries — and
said, '’I don't question the effort,

C the intensity, the way these guys

work.”
”These things have happened,
and I wish I could put a finger on

them,” he said. ”The injury
problem is a factor. But we're go-
ing to dress the 45 guys we've
got, and they can get the job
done!’

One who didn't dress in Phoe-
nix was quarterback Bubby
Brister, who has a chipped bone
on the middle finger of his pass-
ing hand. The finger remains bad-
ly swollen, and Noll doesn't
expect Brister to play in Sunday's
home game against Houston.

Noll hasn't decided whether.

Indiana's Hoosiers, ranked in
The Associated Press college foot-
ball poll for the first time this sea-
son, welcome the national
exposure ' but can't forget the
years of struggle it took to get it,
Coach Bill Mallory said Monday.

Indiana, improving each year
since Mal|ory's winless rookie
‘season in 1984, earned the No.
18 ranking Monday after a 41-7
victory over Ohio State.

Miami, UCLA and Southern
California remained the top three
teams, while Notre Dame moved
from fifth to fourth. The Irish
replaced Auburn, which fell eight
spots to 12th after a 7-6 loss to
Louisiana State.

LSU, 3-2 and ranked 19th after
a one-week absense from the
poll, was the only other new-
comer besides Indiana voted into
this week's Top Twenty.

”The way I look at it, it's good
exposure. It's important, but the
big thing is we have our minds on

.yards against Phoenix in his first
Steelers’ start and Bono was three
of 11 for 27 yards.

”We’ll divide the time between
them again in practice and go
from there,” Noll said.

But where do the Steelers go
from here? They already trail AFC
Central Division-leading Cincin-
nati by five games and appear to

' be headed for their worst season
since 1969, Noll’s first as coach.

The Steelers not only haven't
developed their trademark run-
ning game, they have se|f-de-
structed by committing 18
turnovers in their last four games.

"We've have had a lot of guys
play well for part of a game, then
turn around and make a glaring
error that hurts your whole foot-
ball team,” Noll said. ”We’ve got
guys who are playing good foot-
ball, but the errors have hurt us.
We have to eliminate mistakes in
the running game, eliminate mis-
takes in the passing game  and
get the whole thing going.”

”We’ve got 10 games left, and
we've got to salvage something,”
center Mike Webster said.

"We just can't ship 45 guys out
and ship 45 new ones in," cor-

The Steelers have let a number of teams get away from them on their way to a 1-5 record and last place in the AFC Central.

nerback Dwayne Wood ruff said.
"We have to keep working and
play through it."

The Oilers, who beat the Steel-
ers twice last season for the first
time since division play began in
1970, are 4-2 but are down to
third-team quarterback Brent
Pease because of injuries.

Pease completed only three of
14 passes for 26 yards and three
interceptions, but former Pitts-

the job each week, and the poll
will take care of itself,” said Mal-
lory, whose Hoosiers are 4-0-1.

The only blemish on Indiana's
record is a 28-28 tie with
Missouri.

”It's good, but it boils down to
what we do on Saturday, and
that's where our focus of atten-
tion is,” Mallory said of the na-
tional ranking.

It's also important, he said, that
his players remember it wasn't

Matheis’ positive attitude has
rubbed off on her teammates. ”I
really admire Kelly's intensity and
dedication, not only in games but
in practices as well. Seeing her do
really well really motivates you,”
said freshman Sue Zonneville.

One of the aspects of Matheis’
game that has improved since last
year is her defense, particularly
her digging skills.

"I played a lot more volleyball
this summer than any other. I told
[assistant coach] Sue Hoover I
wanted to be known as defensive

queen,” stated Matheis.

With her improving defense,
Matheis has emerged as one of
the top players in the east. Al-
ready this season she has been
selected for the-all-tourney team
at the Ball State Classic.

The personable Matheis
posesses a keen sense of humor
which runs the gamut from
Church Lady imitations to her
ritual of wearing her uniform a lit-
tle differently for every match, a
manuever which has led to her
teammates jokingly referring to
her as the team's worst-dressed
player.

The esteem and admiration in
which Matheis is held by her
teammates is shown by her selec-
tion as co-captain (along with
Denise Frawley) on this year's
team.

”Kelly is the hardest-working,
most determined person I've met.
She is so enthusiastic; every day
she looks as though she is having
fun,” said teammate Lori Silk.

”She [Matheis] is concerned
about everyone else on the team
as well as herself,” added Mul-
vihill.

Mallory succeeded Sam Wyche

Since the start of the 1987 sea-

best among all Big Ten teams,
and the Hoosiers no longer are
sneaking up on their opponents,
Mallory said.
