Professor Alexander Silverman;
head of the Department of Chemistry,
will deliver the first lecture of a new
series on “Popular Science,” which
has been arranged by Director Doug-
las Stewart of the Carnegie Institute.
The opening electure on “Glass.
Throughout the Afges,” will be a ful-
ly illustrated story of glass making

since ancient times, andis scheduled
for the evening of January 9, in Car-
negie Lecture Hall. »EXhib"its from
the Carnegie Museum, ‘manufacturers
of commercial and art glass, and Pro’-
fessor Si1verman’s private collection
will be shown, ‘ ' - -
‘One of the most interesting devel-
opments in the glass ﬁeld in recent
years has been theinvention of a ma-
chine for the production of. continuous
sheet- glass for window lights." A
number of continuous sheet machines
--are in "operation, each of which pro-’
duces in excess of three million linear
feet, or ﬁfteen million square feet of
glass per annum. Eight. of these ma-
chines now. operating in the United
States and Canada, annually produce
a strip of glass ﬁve feet wide anrllong
enough to encircle the earth. As a
continuous sheet, this would cover a
tract of over three, thousand acres.

on Wednesday, January 10,-Pitt stu-

‘dents and alumni will know which

department, which class and which
fratennity y-'¥possesse,s the greatest
amount of Pitt spirit, Sidney S. Hbehl
in cliargeof the sale of banquet tick-_
ets to students‘, declared when an-

campaign. «
“For many years,” Mr. Hoehl
stated, “various individual groups

have laid claim to possessing. more
Pitt spirit than_any other group"'at
the University. Iibelieve tha_t the at-
tendance at the football" banquet will

1 deﬁnitely determine who is entitled to

this boast and that ‘after the banquet‘
is over, certain organizations, unless
they work hard until January 10, will
ﬁnd that when it comes to Pitt spirit,‘
they possess but little in comparison
with others. A contest to decide this
question will be held. Each student
attending will sign a card atthe ban-
quet giving his name, his class, his
school ‘and his fraternity affiliations

’ and .from the information. secured,

charts will’-ifbe preparedand published

- in the Pitt Weekly showing what per-

centage of each class, department and
Greek letter society-was present. The
relative standing ofqa, particular group
on-one of these charts _will reveal
quite clearly how.’i-it compares with
others in Pitt spirit. Since all com-
putations will .-be made upon" a. per-
centage basis, small groups will have
an equal chance with. those of larger
membership.” ‘ _ ' _ _

C’ To, stimulate the interest -of fra-
ternity men in the banquet, a com-
mittee consisting of a representative

 of ‘each Greek-letter society has been

organized. C. H. Fleming has been
appointed’ chairman‘- of the commit-
tee and has already issued instruc-
tionsto his associates, -urging them
to .commence work at once and ‘em,-
phasizing1_ the importance of securing’
results. In his letter of instructions,"
Fleming" sta.te'd that a ca-mp'a.ign. was
under way among the "non-fraternity-
men‘ on the campus to have. a larger
attendance at the banquet than could’
be developed ' by . the fraternity groups

and urged each ..member of his com-

mittee ‘to do all ‘in his power to‘ se-
cure .100 per cent 'atten'dance.‘ He
stated that a _chart showing the per-
centage of attendance of each frater-
nity group ’would befprepared and
published in the Pitt-Weekly and that
this .ch2'ii1‘;t' would .show, quite deﬁnitely

should. hold» t]1e~conv_ic_tion that the
activities are «theirs, that the"; success
or. failure‘ of a student ' organization
-depends primarily upon their own’ ef-
forts. I have attempted to bring home‘ ,
to student _managers -the realization‘
that the appointment ofya Graduate -
Manager of-Student Activities has not ._
diminished their duties or responsi- .
bilities in the least, has not decreased

their opportunity to serve. _ _  . ’
' “The establishment of the oﬂice has
merely ‘provided ‘a guardian of the-
students-’ interestswhere (none had ex-
isted before, has placed. within» reach.
of student’-leaders a deﬁnite person in,‘
whom ‘. they ‘may conﬁde, from whom

they are responsible." But the actual‘
work connected’ with thezfiiiictioning

formed by —those1‘to:whon_1' ‘the activi-
ties belong—the ‘students. , My job, as
I view it, is to ‘see that theydo their

which ought to ,be:_:done,’ that they; re- >

likely to; be detrimental to the .repu- ‘
tation ‘ or interests _-‘of A themselves or‘ '

He ' also explained ‘the ‘ measures be-

a gr.eater_’numb’er of st'u__dents in extra

of participation _in activities. upon a_
purely, competitive basis wherein each .
student contestant .w_ill_. receive equal
consideration. and merit alone’ will re-

~ﬁgure_sT's‘howing that the __adopt_ion[. of
such  policy has resulted '. in the ‘de-
velopment of greater‘, interest‘ on the -
part. or students,’ stating" that "more,
candidates tried out"',‘for'the Cap and‘
- Gown Club last year-’t'han”.atany time.
in the past; that in excess of 100‘ stu-

-the Musical Clubs‘ this year as: con-
trasted with less than ‘half that"nu‘m-
ber last year;' that more students ‘are
interested in other organizations than
[ever before. , -. .  " ' _

The Graduate -Manager of, Student
Activities spoke at length concerning
the principles I of business manage-
ment which he had introduced. in. the
conduct’ of student. .activities—the
elimination of graft and of padded ex-
pense accounts, adoption‘ of better
bookkeeping ‘methods, the prevention
_of the mingling .-oflorganization and

tinned,’ the ‘purchase rather than ‘re-
peated ‘rental of essential equipment’
was ordered, ’ the mutual use of ‘the
equipment of one organization
-others prevented an‘ unnecessary du-
p1ica.ti_on,, of expense, the _s_ubmi_ssion

Mr. Hoehl stated that many organi-

office, had failedto secure competitive

Instructions were issued to student
managers that competitive bids must
be secured whenever I and wherever
possible andthat -no contract_ should
be: let-0 without the approval -of the
Graduate~'Manager. Examples were
cited showing that the adoption of
this sound business policy" had. re-
sulted in "vast amounts of money be-.

"-‘It is ‘generally agreed that Pitt student spirit reached its high-,
est point right after the disastrous reverses of the first part of the
season just closed. The soli.d backing that the team received was
subject to comment all, over the state, especially in Philadelphia-
where the daily papers "constantly referred to it. Few teams; would

' have railed to respond to such conditions, and few teams could have

been able to respond so effectively asfdid the one that will be hon-'
cred on January 10. . . r ‘ 0‘ c . V " C, _

ﬁcation.‘ W, &. J. has! been flattened, State has been trounced and
success followed the most discouraging setbacks. A coi1'certed»drive

‘ to insure a big attendance is allthat is needed. , The committee. prom

I The score wasnow 10-0g‘\~in, Pitt’s fa-
vor and the prospects seemed bright
of Pitt’s scoring many more points.

No more, however, were to be scored 5'

during the .-first half or in. the third
quarter, although Pitt came "near
enough to .Stanford’s goal twice to al-
low Williams to try for placement
kicks, both of which were unsuccess-
ful. ' .
Exchanges of punts took up the
greater part of the time during the
third quarter. Pitt was gaining in
the punt exchanges, and by the time
the fourth quarter arrived the ball
was deep in Stanford, territory. The
quarter opened with the ball instan-
ford’s possession on her own 18-yard
line." Cleveland of Stanford punted
out of bounds on the Stanford 41-yard
line. On the following play, Ander-
son threw a forward pass to Flana-
gan, who raced 41 yards for a touch-
down. Williams missed the try for
goal this time. ‘
Stanford, 16 points in the ‘rear, de-
cided that she would make the score
lookmore "respectable. She opened
up‘ an aerial attack which, for quite a
few moments/be'Wild,ered the Pitt de-
fense. ‘The ball was advanced to the
Pitt 29-yard line. 0011 a fake place-
ment kick, a forward pass was at-
tempted, but it-was intercepted ‘by
Shuler who had beeninjected into
the game. Stanford was soon in.p'o_s-
session of the ball again when Flana-

gan punted to Stanford on the.Sta'n-

ford 45-yard line.— But the forward
passing game was resumed-until the
ball was advanced to Pitt’s two-yard
line from‘ where Dennis plunged it
over the goalline. Cuddeback scored
the extra’-Tpoint with a placement kick.

Pitt received the kickoff which fol-
lowed and managed to work the ball
down to Sta.nford’s ten-yard line. But‘
the ball was lost on Stanford’s nine-
yard line when a forward pass was
intercepted. Stanford then tried a
couple of forward passes

gained 30' yards between them, but a '
third pass was intercepted at mid-
ﬁeld by Anderson as the game ended.

- _ V ' ,» PlTT IN THE WEST ' .

- Well, it‘s all over! The Panthers put‘ the ﬁnishing touches to agr-and
and glorious season when they trampled over Andy Kerr's team last S,.«'=Itur~
day out in sunny California. .The. Panthers have, from all reports of the
game, created a favorable impression in the West. The smashing type of
game displayed was something new to the Westerners.‘ Hewitt immediately
became a popular idol by reason of his wonderful line‘ plunging.

In spite of their victory the Pitt team did not display the same powerful
and irresistible attack demonstrated against We & J. and State." The long
Iayoff and journey to the coast apparently took the edge off the Panthers’
greatwork. It is almost humanly impossible for-a team to cross the con-
tinent and retain its former condition after days of travel in a stuffy Pull-
man. . .- _ _

In addition, Leland Stanford displayed a brand of football that took on
to a large extent the appearances of an Eastern. team. Coach Kerr has
worked wonders in the coast school. The Western players possess individual
strength but seem to lack a thorough knowledge of the fine ‘points, of the
game. When Coach Kerr completes his instruction to these men, watch
out! —

 

- . THE BASKET BALL SEASON
The basket ball season opens with a bang Friday. The Panthers have
splendid material this fall and should present a ﬁrst-class team. The floor
game has been rapidly coming to the front the last several seasons neces-
sitating the Ieasing of the large ‘auditorium at Motor Square Garden. All the
Panther, home games are to be played on this floor. The one thing that

‘has really madethe great teams at Princeton, Pennsylvania "and Cornell has

been.the.support given by the student body. Nuf ced. Let's go! All out
too the Motor Square‘ Garden Friday to watch the Panther squeeze the
range.

THE ALL-AMERICAN

Walter Camp’s* choice for the All-American is at last out. Bowser has.
been given the center berth on his second team. Garbisch, of Army and
formerly "of W. & J., received the first choice. Sack, together with several
other Pitt men, have been given «honorable mention.

A word ought to be added about Mr. Camp’s teams and his selections.
His teams have long ago lost the prestige carried by .them several seasons
ago. The. rapid growth of the football sphere throughout the country has
made it practically impossible for one man to pick one teamfto represent the
whole country. We rather favor sectional teams if the choosing is to bel
indulged in at all. ,

Along this same line, it must be said, it is just about time some steps be
taken to eliminate the .~“eight year” man from collegiate competition. In
allowing a man to participate.four years in regular college football then
permitting him to play for a government institution, it is decidedly unfair
to the opposing players ‘and teams. It is our contention that these men be
restrained fromvmtercollegiate competitions.

Includes Many Hard Games 

 

Carnegie Tech, and Grove

‘ City Are ‘' Added to »-the
Panther Program - Buck-
nell is First Game—Six
Hard Games Are on" the
Schedule

 

Graduate Manager of Athletics, K.
E. Davis, l1as announced the football
schedule for the Panthers for the
season of 1923. The only changes in
opponents named are. the addition of
Carnegie Tech and Grove City, and
the elimination of Geneva and_ Ci'n-
cinnati. The two year return game
contract with Bucknell will be. played
at Lewisburg instead of Forbes Field,
and the annual clash with Syracuse
will be held at New York in the big
stadium there. The initial game with
Bucknell will inaugurate their new
stadium. _Following Bucknell, Lafa-
yette will make her yearly visit to
Pittsburgh under the command of the
renowned “.l’oick” Sutherland» The
lads from Easton have two victories
over Pitt and this is to be one of
the most popular home contests, as
the Panthers are out for “blood,” and
the Lafayette students will be on
hand to root their team to a third con-
secutive victory. - _

‘The Saturday following Lafayette,
the West Virginia University will be
on hand to give Pitt another battle
as they did last season. Following
the Mountaineers’ trip to the Smoky

~ City, the Panthers will journey to

Gotham where they will meet Syra-
cuse in the annual tilt with the Salt
City team. Saturday, October 27, Pitt
will meet her ancient rival and city
friend, Carnegie Tech in a, game at
Forbes Field. This is the ﬁrst time
that the University of Pittsburgh has
met the Tartans for‘ two years.

The management is looking for a
record crowd. that day,vas the popu-

‘lus of the city of Pittsburgh is much

interested in the two schools, and
the fans are talking up the game al-
ready. = '_

The Saturday after the Tech game
they will go to Franklin Field in
Philadelphia to have the regular year-
ly game with the Quaker gridders.‘ It
is estimated that a crowd of 50,000
will be present. Then comes Grove
City, the team that won the Class

“B” championship this season, in the '

place of Geneva. The Crimson should

make a. ﬁne dra-Wing card. as there are
many‘ followers -and alumni of the
Grove CitY_ College in ‘ Pittsburgh.
This team IS coached by “Chalky”
Williamson, an alumnus of Pitt. Next
comes. Washington and - Jefferson.
This will be a ﬁne game, although
Pitt ‘did give the Washingtonians a.
trouncing this year. The Red and

Black expect to come back at the ,

Panthers with much vim and the

Presidents cannot be looked on light- .

ly.
' The Saturday before Thanksgiving
1S now open, and the usual method is
to leave this date vacant and let the

team rest up for the Turkey day con-

test, but it is likely that a game will

be secured for this date, so as to keep,

the team going right along. Penn
State College will make its appear-
ance against the Oakland grid ers. on
Thanksgiving and the Nittany ollow-
ers are in for revenge for the defeat
handed to them by Pitt this year.
This will be the closing struggle of
the football season. The
now has nine teams to be played, and
it is likely that another will be added
to take the vacancy left in the Satur-
day prior to Thanksgiving.

Six of the opponents of Pitt will
have the one year residence rule next
year. Up to this time, Pitt was the
one of the only three colleges in Penn-
sylvania to have this one year resi-
dence rule. West Virginia, Lafayette,

and Carnegie Tecl_1_ will adopt it, and

the following year, W. & J. will en-
force it. Syracuse, Pennvstate, and
Penn are already in line, a I Grove
City will not use players who have
taken part in a game of football at
another college the year before.

The schedule for the Panthers is
by no means easy and it will mean
hard work for the squad and students
to win the majority of the games
played, Six of the games next sea-

son will be at home, while three are

abroad.
