 

.- R

the, ﬁrst two “cores” of a four subject program to integrate
students into university studies and to develop a broader
general education. Sections will be scheduled in the humani-

ties and social sciences.

Core curriculum is a compara-
tively new concept in education
which integrates phases of learn-
ing in order to develop a well
rounded person and to bring about
a more realistic approach. toward
subject matter.

The program will eventually
consist of four “cores”: communi-

cation skills, introduction to the '

humanities, social sciences, and
physical sciences (or biological
sciences.) Two faculty commit-
tees which have been studying
curricular for social sciences and
humanities,_ expect to have gen-
eral plans ready for faculty ex-
amination by April.
Individuals working on course

planning committees have been ‘

-released from a portion of.
teaching to work on the new
system. At‘ the present time,
members are attempting to
establish the content of the
courses and the form to be fol-
lowed in their administration. ’
Eventually students will be re-
quired to take all four “core” cur-
ricula. They would provide one-

half of the student’s credits earned ‘

during his first two years at the
university.

Each of the courses will prob-
ably be three credits, with the. ex-
ception of sciences which requires
lab hours. They all will be intro-
ductory in nature. To stimulate
thinking, core will encourage stu-
dents to find out, “How do we

» know what we know?”

Clases in the humanities will
involve an A integrated study of
modern literature, philosophy,
music, fine arts, and religion to

— introduce students to the term-
inology. and concepts which it
encompasses. Studies will cen-
tersaround a theme of the na-
ture and conditions of man,‘as
he himself has expressed them.
Elements of’ history, political
science, sociology, geography, eco-
nomics, anthropology and social
psychology will be combined in
the social science _curiculum. Em-
phasis will be placed on the prob-
lems and principle’s of man’s
social institutions.
' Concerning the other courses,
Dr. Jones who is also general co-
-ordinator of the core program,
said, “We hope in the near future

- to get -started on planning the

courses in communication skills
gnd a course or courses in the
natural sciences area.” ‘
Plans for the “test run” for
first courses are being deter-
minedby two faculty commit-
tees which began a study of the
‘new culiculum at the beginning
of the present term. They have
contacted 0 th er universities
where core has already been
effected.

Dr. Putnam AF. Jones is chair-
man of the humanities committee.
Other faculty representatives
serving are. Robert “Alexander,
instructor, fine arts; Hary Goldby,
assistant professor, modern lan-
guages; Dr. Robert Griswold, as-
sociate professor, music apprecia-
tion; Dr. Wm. C. Panetta, instruc-

A new plan was sought after
it was discovered that the fresh-

of this time problem, the plan
was developed to give freshman

Benefits from Drive

This year’s Pitt Chest Drive, which begins Monday,
Dec. 6, and ends Friday, Dec. 11, is unique in that two-
thirds of the money raised will remain in the University to
be appropriated to__;student charity organizations.

Pitt Chest chairmen believe that a substantial gain can
be made on last year’s total of $1500, since 6000 full-time
students are registered in the University and 'promotion has

been planned.
Student organizations to

beneﬁt from the drive are

World University Service, United Negro College Fund, Negro
Scholarship and Service Fund for Nego students, Men’s Loan

. A
Association, and Women’s Loan‘

Association.

Community Chest, Cancer So-
ciety, Red Cross, CARE, American
Heart Association, and March of
Dimes will benefit from the re-
maining third of the donations.

On Dec. 6 and 7, speakers from
the Chest committee will solicit
donations and pledges in the class
rooms during fourth hour.

Members of the committee, ad-
vised by Charles Elliott assistant
to the dean of men, are Jane Pick?-
ering, Col. ’55, chairman; Meade
Beers, Col. ’57, and Don Pollock,
Col. ’-58, publicity; Clarence Ky-
lander, Col. ’56, vice-chairman;
Ray Blackham, Bus. Ad. ’55, and
Marvin Lieber, Bus. Ad. ’55,
finances; Paul Balles. Col. ’56,
special events; Bill Truby, Col.
’56, speakers, and Rose Damian,
Col. ’57.

Among projects planned are
auction- and tape-recorded radio
programs. Discussing the merits
of Pitt Chest over radio sta-
tions WMCK and WLOA will be
Meade Beers, Jane Pickering,
Clarence Kylander, Marvin Lie‘-
ber, and Paul Balles.

As an added attraction, the
Carnegie Museum is lending an

1th Century German treasure
chest to be displayed in the
Cathedal.

Characteristic of the enthusiasm
being put into the Drive by the
committee is Jane Pickering’s
plea: “Just one dollar will de-
liver two packages--28 pounds-
of surplus food to a needy‘fam-
ily.” .

The entire Pitt Chest Committee
hopes that .Pitt students will ful-
fill their obligations to their
school and society by giving next
week to the 1954-55 Pitt Chest.

’ British Archaeologist to Lecture Here

As Discoverer of Early Greek Writing ' .

By GERRY BENKOVICH
Dr..Arthur M. Young, headof the classics department,

said that an ancient languag
Greeks even farther back into
been instrumental in bringing

e recently found “dates the
civilization.” Dr. Young has

the discovery of these writ-I

ings, Prof. Alan J. B. Wace, to Pitt for a lecture.

Wace, an outstanding British archaeologist, found the

clay tablets in 1951 while excavating at Mycenae in southern

Greece. He and many other scho-6
lars were unable to translate them.
They believed the Mycenae civili-
zation must have been non-Greek
since no Greek codes tanslated
the writings.

‘Nobody’ Translates
The ancient writings, found on
terra cotta clay tablets, were espe-
cially interesting to Dr. Young for
he spent some time touring Greece
and “walking through their cities.”

‘The mysterious writings were

pert in the British army cracked
the secret. His ability shown in
translating was especially re-
markable because “a so-called
‘nobody’ in the archaeology ﬁeld
was able to acomplish more than
the experts,” said Dr. Young.

‘ The language was Greek but
it was written in an alphabet
different from the usual Greek.
This gave evidence that Greek
civilization dates back to 1500
B. C. —
Dr. Young has 'made arrange-
ments for the Cambridge scholar
to speak in the Fine Arts lecture
hall, 324 CI., Friday, Dec; 3, at
8:15 p.m. ,
Author and Lecturer

“Professor Wace has been as-
sociated with the Greek world as
a student and scholar for a half
cenutry,” commented Dr. Young.
He will speak to the Archaeologi-
cal Institute on “Excavations at
Homeric Mycenae, 1954—New
Discoveries.” .

“The whole ﬁeld of Homeric
studies has been affected by ex-_
plosive. discoveries at Mycenae,”
said Dr. Young.

Although the classics head is
concerned with the excavations in
ancient cities, he is interested
mainly “in the literature of arch-
aeology.” A member of the Pitt
faculty since 1946, he is a profes-
sor of Greek and archaeology. He
received his Ph.D in Rome after
graduating from Harvard. .

In 1948 Dr. Young wrote “Troy
and Her Legend” whichgwas voted
the best book in the Pittsburgh
area for that year. He is also the
editor of “Lanterna,” a Latin pub-
lication. ' ‘

 Anti In tellectualism

:7 Freedom of speech, one of the basic keystones of this
nation, is once again being threatened with abridgment. But
this time the threat springs not from a subversive group
but rather from two of the primary seats of learning in
these United States, Annapolis and West Point.

Both of these schools have issued formal statements
to the effect that they will not participate in intercolle-
giate. debates on the question of diplomatic recognition of
Communist China by the United States. The Department

. of the Army maintains that cadets should not “debate on
such a controversial subject on which . . .
has already been formed.”

Several minor problems are unearthed by this state-
ment along with the major consideration of suppressed
opinion. The question of recognition has been oﬁicially
designated as the topic of the year for intercollegiate de-
bating competition. Thus ‘neither academy will be able to
participate in official intercollegiate‘debates. In addition
to thisvfact, West Point has been ‘scheduled as the host
school for the national debating championship. In the light.
of the ban, West Point is in a rather embarrassing, posi-

national policy

The Navy has said that since one of the debating teams
must argue the affirmative of the question thereby condon-
ing recognition of Red China they would be, in effect,
upholding “the Communist philosophy and party line.” The
« Navy also stated that this question would provide the Com-
munist party with a “tremendous propaganda device.”

' They ‘apparently have failed to take into account the
‘fact that the ban on debate will provide the Reds with a
wedge of_ even greater size in that they will be able to
attack the entire country on the question of freedom of
speech. Basically they would be dangerously close to fact‘
in accusing -the United"‘States of curbing the vdice of its

Why then must the debate question be censored by
the two" military schools when it has been accepted by the
colleges and universities of the nation as a suitable, timely, ,
and highly debatable question? Any barrier to knowledge
which blocks the minds’ of America’s students is actually
‘blocking the growth of this country as a democracy and
as‘ a recognized leader in a free world.

,nor has there ever been one who,

By Jim Deweese _ .
Much is being said in this age of specializa-
tion with regard to the insigniﬁcance of the com-
mon man if indeed “there is such an individual. I
propose that such a person does not exist.

But on a larger scale I propose that the term M

insigniﬁcance is not one. which may be used to
relegate a person to the archives of obscurity. For
there is no person living tpday

when viewed it in relation to his
fellow men, could be considered
insigniﬁcant.

Each person, indeed each liv-
ing thing, is signiﬁcant in not
orﬂy the lives of the peoplebut
in the much larger sense of the
vast and encompassing universe
whose limits man has yet to

' deﬁne.

There are those who deride the man who seeks
not to attain greatness but rather to live his life-
span basically for himself. These critics scoff at
such a person just as they scoff at his aspiring
counterpart who seeks to attain the elusive heights
of greatness above his fellow men even though
he may present a detriment to the society in which
he lives. and of which-he is a part.

The Earth's Autobiography

‘But it is because he is a part of that society

that he is‘signi.ﬁcant. Even those who are branded
by law as enemies of society must in time assume
their place in the autobiography of the world.
An autobiography to which veachday brings a
new chapter. _ ‘
Within the chapter are included all the ‘sup-
posedly insigniﬁcant peoples of the earth. The
housewife who ‘cans tomatoes once at year and

‘washes diapers once a day, the ofﬁce worker who

never deviates from his nine to ﬁve schedule,
the incoherant derelict who sprawls in the gut-
ter’s refuse. Each appears in his assigned order

The Significance of Being

 

  

     

,and in his respective role. If they were to be
omitted not even the greatness of the contemporary
geniuses could ﬁll the gap for just as the genius
hold his place, so the illiterate, confused, little
men- of the world hold theirs.
Recognition of Limitations

Upon every man rests the burden of his limita-
tions. One of the marks of a man—i_s his ability to
recognize those limitations and live accordingly.
And most men do. ‘ U

Very few of us are capable of the works of
men such as Charles Lindbergh, or Ernest Heming-
way, or Jonas Salk or Sinclair Lewis. For each
of these men and the thousands like them there
must be millions who appear to donothing when
bathed in the light of their brilliance. And yet
someone has to make Hemingway’s breakfast.
Someone has to launder Salk’s shirts. Someone
has to change the oil in Lindbergh’s car. And some-
one has to read the works of Lewis or all has
gone for naught.
A Common Failing . \

And yet it seems to be one of man’s most com-
mon failings, this pointing to the other fellow and
calling him a do—nothing. It is with the ﬁnger-

'pointer that a bitter irony rests.“ For by his point-

ing he has done nothing for those whose limits
have been reached. He has done nothing for the
genius who is dedicated to his chosen path. And
he has donenothing for the person who is capable
but has failed to begin his ‘climb. For, when the
right opportunity unfolds before him,‘ he will go
or he will remain static. But ‘he must not be
pushed, for a man pushed is a man working
against his will and such work has proven want-
ing since the beginnings of recorded history.

The greater the man, the closer to insigniﬁ-
cance he can feel when-the turns his gaze to the
heavens and considers the limitless expanse of

, the galaxies. And yet the magnitude of the uni-

verse demands that man, by his very existence,
is a signiﬁcant factor in a scheme of being which
is beyond the comprehensive limits of his brain.

Schools Within a School

. By Cecy Lincoff

enough information.

Debaters
Editor, PITT NEWS

In view of the controversy sur-
rounding the use of this year’s
intercollegiate debate topic, Re-
solved: That the United States‘
should extend diplomatic recog-
nition to the Communist Govern-
ment of China, perhaps your
readers would be interested in
knowingthe reactions of Pitt de-
baters and audiences.

No member of the Pitt squad
has voiced the feeling that the
topic is undebatable, and no one
has refused to take the Affirma-
tive side. No member of faculty
or administration has ‘suggested’
that we not debate it because of
unfavorable publicity, or because
it will play into the Communists’
hands, or because Afﬁrmatives
may some day have their words
used against them. In fact, Vice-
Chancellor Nutting has agreed to
make a major policy statement
about Pitt’s position on the topic
at the banquet following our Sev-
enth Annual Tournament on De-
cember 11--and I can assure you
it will differ from the statements
made by the Dean at Roanoke,
the Presidents of the Nebraska

-Teachers Colleges, andithe Com-
mandants of West Point and An- S

       

 

perien'ce' in all phases of retailing.

I felt thatjymy trudge up the hill
to.-Municipal Hospital was well
worth the exertion when I sat
spell-bound listening to ‘the op-
portunities in -public health as
listed by Dr. Parran. Though
only able to give me a limited
amount of time, the "dean had a
well organized summary of in-
formation on the Graduate School
of Public Health. ,

I had one of those all-over
good feelings after speaking with

medical school and I could not
get together. Although three ap-
pointments were made,‘ some-
thing came up each time. I know
that from them, a /very important
question of hopeful M.D.’s ‘could
be explained, the much talked
about quota system of medical
schools all over the country.

I wish I could have taken all
of the Pitt students with me to
see the ﬁne facilities and meet the
people" who make Pitt’s ‘schools
outstanding across the n-ation.

Pen Letter, of Protest

napolis. '

, Further, we have debated this
topic at six high schools, four Ro-
tary Clubs, four Lions Clubs,
three“ Kiwanis Clubs, at a teach-

: ers meeting, and on television-—
and no one has suggested that

the Afﬁrmatives sounded like
party liners, or that the topic was
in‘ any way inappropriate. If
timidity prevails elsewhere, it
does not prevail in Western
Pennsylvania. ‘ '

The exact number of schools
who have shied away .from this
topic is hard to- discover. Cer-
tainly the vast majority have not

~ suffered intimidation; twenty-ﬁve

leading Eastern institutions are
coming here to debate it, and
tournaments elsewhere seem to
be ﬂourishing. Only Roanoke, the
Service Academies, the Nebraska
-Teachers Colleges, the College of
Steubenville, and Mt. St. Joseph
in Cincinnati. are on record as
withdrawing. Against them are
Harvard, .Yale, Princeton, Dart-
mouth, ‘Fordham, Georgetown,
Notre Dame, and, of course, Pitt.
I do not myself believe thatvob-A
jectors’ to the question have any
ground to stand on.i Theoreti-
callrs debate... is  an exercise 

argumentation. iTeams are in- “

terested in learning. techniques,
becoming familiar with the sub-
ject, and practicing -thinking un-
der ﬁre. Mr.
Post-Gazette has quoted me cor-

rectly: taking the Affirmative side «

of such a debate is roughly
equivalent to belonging to the
“enemy” during a major military
maneuver in which your set out
to test the defenses of Ft.tDix.
In such a situation, it is com-
pletely irrelevant whether the
soldier “believes” that Ft. Dix
“should” be taken, or whether
Red China “should” be recog-
nized. He is playing a role, usu-
ally in preparation for playing
the role of prosecutor or defense
attorney in later life. Do we not
require both, even when the de-
fendent is guilty? ,

Practically, the best Affirma-
tive case so far is based on the
contention that recognition would
provide the only opportunity for
us to further a Titoist break from
Russia and thus weaken Com-,
munism by division. If this is
party-lining, let us have more
of it. .

DECEMBER AND MAY: ACT II

, Synopsis of Act I: A middle-aged English Professor, named Phipps
has fallen desperately in love with a rosy-kneed coed named Mc-
Fetridge. Phipps doesn’t know how to go about courting Miss
McFetridge, for, after all, he is a professor in the autumn of his
life, and she is a coed with rosy _knees. Professor Twonkey, who
shares an oﬁice with Phipps, proposes the following plan: Phipps
will ask Miss McFetridge to come to his office for 9. conference late .
in the afternoon. He will be urbane and charming and make fright-
fully witty remarks about English lit, and Miss, McFetridge will
laugh and laugh. After an hour of this high-type hilarity, Phipps
will look at his watch, exclaim at the lateness of the hour, and insist
on driving Miss McFetridge home. On the way home, he will pass a
theatre that shows French movies. They’ll see the movie, then have
an ex uisite French dinner, and Miss McFetridge will be so enchanted
that s e cannot but yield to his suit.

So at the beginning of Act II, we find Phlipps in his office. awaiting
poor young innocent. _ C _
as new leather patches on his elbows. There is
a knock on the door. He opens it and admits a gorgeous creature with

Booters Return  

For Exhibition‘

With Heidelberg
Coach Leo Bemis’ booters re-

turn to action ‘this week for an
exhibition game against the

‘powerful Heidelburg team Sat-

urday, Dec. 4, at 7:310 p.m. on the
Springdale High School field.

The Pitt eleven, even though,

they compiled an enviable 8-1

' record during the past collegiate

season, will be decided under-
dogs against thg. former National
Open Champs from Heidelberg.
However, Coach" Bemis thinks
that his squad has an excellent
chance to spring an upset if all
of the key_ members of the team

will be able to play on Saturday‘
, night.

The game is being played in an
effort to promote interest in
soccer throughout the Pittsburgh
area and to encourage the spread
of soccer in high school sports.
Students from several schools in-

terested in organizing soccer
teams will be guests at the game.

Six in Playoffs

The Interfraternity Bowling
season ended Monday for all but
the six teams which qualified for
the playoffs. The top three teams
in each section will vie in the
playoffs at the University Alleys
next week.

Only two quintets in each
section compiled better than
.500 marks. Section A leaders
were Kappa Nu (12-3) and Phi
Gamma Delta (14-1) while Del-
ta Tau Delta (14-1) and Phi
Epsilon Pi (13-2) set the pace
in Section B. '

The battle for the third-place
spot in each. division had to be
decided on the basis of total pins
as a result of ties in the won-lost
standings. Although Sigma Pi lost
two of three games to. Theta Chi
in this week’s bowling, they man-
aged to cop the third playoff spot
by over 300 pins.

Boastin;g the loop’s top kegler,
Milt Emery, Pdii Delta Theta won
five of their last six games and
edged Sigma_Chi for a place in the
playoffs.

The Delt’s Jack Brown and
Don Dalton with 146.1 averages
tied for second place in the indi-
vidual standings behind Em-
ery’s 158.3. Sig Chi’s Bill Furrer
had the season’s single-game
high of 210. .

Rounding out the league’s top
eight bowlers are Ernie Rohrer of
Phi Kappa, Furrer, Lee Silverman
of Phi Ep, and Tom Kay and Dick
Swanson of the Delts.

 

hio State First Foe As
T immons Lists Starters

By GENE AROMATORIO
With little more than a chance .to kick the mud from his
cleats and step into gym shoes, Coach Bob Timmons will un-
veil his second model of the Panther cagers tonight when the
Blue and Gold meet Ohio State’s Buckeyes at the Field House
at 8:15 p.m. .
Timmons, who in the fall is end coach for the grid eleven,
has stepped indoors to resume his head coaching duties of the
basketball five. - 6

lopll-Ooh. nmupomn noun; a... tuning: no. 2..

In the way of a nucleus with
which to build this year’s team
around, Timmons has only five
returning. lettermen and just two
of those were regulars.

Ready to hold down one of the
forward slots is 6-3 team captain
Ed Pavlick who
last year led in
rebound
d e p a r t in ent
and was second
in scoring with
308 points for
an average of
13.4 per game.

T e am ing
with Pavlick
at the other

f o r wa r d is

senior Frank

Zimmovan who last year earned
‘ his monogram mainly as a sub

but toward the close of the sea-

son saw action as a starter.

The other regular back from
last year is 6-0 junior Joe Fen-
wick who will move back into his
old guard post from where he
tossed in 223 points last year to
rank third among the scorers.

Opposite Fenwick, manning the
other guard, will be 6-2 Joe Resu-
tek who saw action as a sub in 14
games last year but didn’t'win a
varsity award. -

Topping off ’the Panther hoop-
sters at the center post will be
6-5 sophomore Bob Lazor who
was a standout last year on the
freshman quintet.

In discussing his team’s

Timmons

    

chances against the Buckeyes
tonight, Timmons thinks that
“If we can stop Robin Freeman
we stand a good chance of up-
setting them.”

Freeman is the 5-11 junior who
last year led the scoring parade
with 22 markers when the Bucks
dumped the Panthers 74-55 at
Columbus. The flashy guard had"
a scoring average of 21 points per
game last winter.

Who will guard Freeman is a
good question. As’ things stand
right noiv it looks like the job will
go to either Zimmovan or Resutek.

According to Timmons, the local
fans can expect to see a faster,
better-shooting, and generally
better all-around club in action
tonight than last year’s squad.
The hardwood tutor feels that his
team will have more depth this

year enabling them to play a
much faster game. -
As Timmons sees it, “Last

year, I only had five men I
could depend on, so they had to
play almost_the whole game. As
a result they tired in the second
half and we bogged down. This
year I have eight or ten men
that Tm sure of, so we should
be able to play a faster game.”
Making up.most of the" depth
will be the second team which

consists of 6-4 forward John Riser, ‘

6-3 forward Suttbn Tait, 6-5 cen-
ter Dave Duessel, 6-2, guard Bob
Show, and 6-1 guard Dick Lep-
kowski. '

Previously, the one-and-one rule had the shooter with
two tries to make one point as he got a second if he missed.
Now the initial attempt is very important and it is believed
that this will improve the_calibre of shooting.‘

Coach Bob Timmons Commented that this “isn’t much
better than last year. It slows the game up too much.” The’
second-year mentor also poked out at basketball rule mak-

there’s less whistle blowing.”

National magazines, which hit the stands about ﬁve
weeks before the season. started, have this year’s Panthefs
tabbed not much better than theisquad which rolled up a
9-14 record last winter. Their basis is that the. cagers played
almost as tough a schedule as the footballers and they pre-
dict that this season’s listing isn’t any easier.

And, speaking of football, Line Coach Bill Bevan, who
came here at Red D°awson’s request, left for his home in Min-
nesota last week: He is not expected to return, no matter
who the new coach is, since his stay at Pitt was only to
‘assist his old friend Dawson. *

Quick > quote from Frosh Grid Coach Steve Petro
on the prospects of the varsity for next fall—“We’ll know
at the end of spring drills how we stand for the season.”
Petro feels that it is in the spring that football is taught.

varsity but morefor the regulars to learn,’’ says the

Originally planned for Friday in the Commons Room,
it was felt that lack of support in the past when better teams
were had, would bring about an even less, attended aﬁair
this year. Well, it all matters how you look at it! .In my
book, when four teams you’_ve met end up in bowl games
and you’ve beaten two of them and another, Notre Dame,
would go if permittedgand when six of the teams on the
schedule are in the national top twenty,,you’re pretty lucky
to escape with. a 4-5 chart.

The shirt was sure to go.

He’d wear it first to English class
From thence to Physics Lab 1
He found himself, like most young men

Quite fond of his VAN GAB.

A real darb!)

“ He’d wear it when he went to bed

Becausehe liked nice things,

And Van Gab’s special “ﬁnish’?
Makes it soft as angel’s wings.

He’d wear it in the shower

And his roommates thought him daft
But he knew that it was washable

And so he merely laft.

(Certiﬁed completely washable, even
for commercial laundries, by American

He loved its Sportown collar,
Fine with tie and ﬁne without.
