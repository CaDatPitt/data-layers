  First threat A
‘ received at
  dorm

. By The Pitt News Staff

. On Tuesday, Pitt evacuated ﬁve cam-

pus buildings because of general
bomb threats.

Pitt Emergency Notiﬁcation Sys-

tem alerts notiﬁed students about the
threats at the Cathedral of Learning

and Chevron Science Center, while the ‘

Litchﬁeld Towers dormitories were
evacuated early in the morning with-
out a campus-wide alert. Tuesdayis
threats brought this semester’s bomb
threat total to 12 and the total for the
week to ﬁve.

Early Tuesday morning, the Li-
tchﬁeld Towers complex becamethe
fourth building on campus to receive

a general bomb threat — the 10th of '

the semester. ENS alerts went out for
Chevron and the Cathedral at 10 a.m.
and 2:30 p.m., respectively. A
, Shortly before the general bomb
threat at the Cathedral Tuesday af-
ternoon, Chancellor Mark Norden-
berg sent out an email that evoked
the memory of the March 8 Western
Psychiatric Institute shooting on Pitt’s
campus. . ‘
“Particularly givenlast month’s
shootings at the Western Psychiatric _
Institute and Clinic and recent re-
minders of violence ‘on other cam-
puses, those responsible for these
threats not only lack basic respect’
for the thousands of people whose
lives have been disrupted by them but
must possess a heartless streak,” he
said in the email. The email went on
to say that the University would seek
to prosecute those responsible to the
“fullest extent of the law.”
NeitheraUniversity spokesperson
nor someone from the Pittsburgh’s
FBI office was available for com-
ment.

By Em Maier
Staff Writer .

Pitt will help students looking to ﬁll their
resumés - and their pockets«— this summer
by holding a job fair aimed speciﬁcally at the
summer months. ‘

The Career Development and Placement
Assistance Oiﬁce will host the third annual
Summer Survivaljob Fair today from noon to
3 p.m. in the William Pitt Union Ballroom.

More than 75 companies from a wide range
of disciplines, including retail, restaurant, en-
tertainment and education, will set up tables
with the aim of recruiting students. A

“Many companies are seeking both ﬁ1ll-
time and part-time employees for the summer,
and depending on the needs of each company,

‘ jobs do have the potential to carry over into

the fall semester,” said Amanda Sell, the spe-
cial events coordinator for the Career Devel-
opment and Placement Assistance Office.

Jobs in the paralegal field are
growing faster than average.

Sell said students have typically been
very successful at ﬁnding employment via
the fair.

The companies originate from all over
the Pittsburgh region and include local busi-

nesses, such as the Carnegie Science Center,

as well as larger nationwide chains.

While the dress code is more relaxed at the
summer fair than at the Fall and Spring Career
Fairs, Sell said she encourages students to
don professional apparel. She urged students
to make good impressions,- which canibegin
with appearances.

The application process for most featured

businesses will be faster than is typically V

found on the job hunt. Sellsaid applications
will be available on site, and many employ-
ers_ will be doing on-campus interviews to
select students in order to quickly ﬁll open
positions, allaying anxieties of students and
employers alike. . '

Not all of the visiting employers will be
offering jobs. - l V '

Board votes
to fund dance

marathon

By Michael Ringling
Staﬁfwri ter

In line with previous years, Student Gov-
ernment Board approved funding requests
by Pitt Greek Life for the 2013 Pitt Dance
Marathon.

But the measure faced some opposition,

and the Board president said one Board
member shouldn’t have voted at all.
At Tuesday night’s Student Government

. Board meeting, the Board voted to approve A’

the Interfraternity Council’s previously'de—
ferred request of $29,630.56 for PDM. In

a 6-2 vote, Board members Halim Genus.
- and Zoe Samudzi voted against funding the

event. A
’ After the meeting, Board Presidentjames
Landreneau said that while a number of

Board members are involved in Greek Life, ’

only Board member Megan McGrath “abso—
lutely should have abstained” from the vote
due to her role in Greek Week. .

McGrath, Vice president of logistics for
the Greek Week Executive Board, said that
she wasn’t directly involved with the plan-
ning board for PDM. _

“Just beinga‘ member of Greek com— '

munity is not a’ good reason to abstain,”

McGrath said. “I felt comfortable voting 

I don’t think all Greeks should abstain from
[voting on] all Greek events.”

. While'PDM involves non—Greek organiza—.

tions, it is a part of Greek Week, according

« to the Student Affairs Web page for Greek

Week.
Board member Natalie Rothenberger

i moved to approve the line item in full, and

a lengthy discussion followed the move-
ment. . . V, A

— Board member Halim Genus said he
didn’t think the Student Activities Fund
should go toward an event that was designed
to raise funds. But after giving his short
testimony, he shot the discussion back to

. the ‘IFC representative. - t _ __
“I’m looking to be swayed,” Genus said.

Lauren Jentleson, a representative for
Pitt Greek Week, vice president of Greek

Sing and former _SGBmember, said that Feel- ,

Good, the student groupthat sells grilled
cheese sandwiches in Nordy’s Place on
Thursdays, also receives funds from SGB for

.its fundraising activities. She said that there .

is not enough money in the IFC budget to pay
for the event without help from SGB.

She said IFC is working to involve more
non- Greek organizations and that the event

~ is the largest fundraising event on Pitt’s cam-

pus. But the event is still in the planning
stages. 1 » - .
“There area lot of kinks that need to be

. worked out,”Jentleson said.

Bonn THREATS

FROM PAGE l

Following the threat to the Cathedral, the
University posted on the my.pitt portal that they
have opened classrooms for Saturday classes on
April 14 and April 21, and that students should be
aware of their make—up schedules by April 7.

Enrico Mazza is one of the more than 1,800
students who live in the Towers dormitories. At
around 3:30 a.m., he woke up to the sound of
alarms telling students to evacuate. A Pitt ENS
alert was not sent out about the evacuation. .

“It’s getting annoying,” the biology major
said inTowers Lobby at 10:30 a.m., stillwearing
pajama pants. ‘5I don’t want to do it anymore,

especially when I’m asleep.” , V

Buses brought some Towers residents up to
the Petersen Events Center, while others waited
in David Lawrence Hall for Towers to reopen
two and a half hours later.

Several hours after residents reentered Tow-

ers, Pitt evacuated Chevron. The building was
reopened nearly an hour and a halflater. This is
Chevron’s third bomb threat of the semester.

' The Cathedral of Learning’s evacuation

‘caused freshman Alexis Scott to miss her cal-

culus class for a third time due to threats.

_ APitt ENS alert sent around 2:30 p.m. alerted
people to the general bomb threat received at
the building.

“At ﬁrst it was like, “We can all go outside
and tan.” Now, with ﬁnals coming up, missing
class is crucial because we don’t have as much

This was the seventh bomb threat the Cathe-
dral of Learning has received since March 14.

Pitt senior Erika Zimmerman was standing _

outside the Cathedral following the afternoon
threat. . _ .
“I don’t know what else they can do,” Zim-
merman said. “You can’t stop taking it seriously
because one of these times it might be some-
thing.” ‘ -
At 5 p.m., the Cathedral reopened, in time
for the evening’s night classes. .
After the two bomb threats on Monday, Pitt
posted amessage on the my.pitt homepage no-
tifying students that the award had increased

from $10,000 to $50,000 for anyone who has

Pitt’s Schoolnof Medicine, will present A

on FutureDerm, the blog about skin care
and health that she has run for ﬁve years.

Zevola entered the competition to get

closer to her goal of gathering $300,000
in seed money for her new product, UV

. Pods.

Zevola intends to launch UV Pods, non-

resealable containers with the recom— .

mended four ounces of sunscreen for a
user’s facial protection,’ this June.

She said her idea — -on which she
already holds a provisional patent that
grants her one year of protection while she
ﬁles a full patent application ~— is simple
and meets a market need. Zevola said that
most consumers use only about half of the

recommended portion of sunscreen.
“I’I_n not interested in reinventing the
wheel. I’m interested in inventing things
that are new and innovative,” she said.
Zevola said that her blog through Fu-
tureDerm has already proved “very proﬁt-
able,” and describedthe process of enter-

ing the contest as a great way to refine ,

communication with investors.
Lehman also emphasized that net-

working is an important component of '

the competition. .

“My goal is that every student, wheth-
er_a finalist, a Wildcard entry or a past
winner, will leave there with at least one
contact that they can useto leverage their
business forward,” he said. I »

THE MOUSTACHE CLUB OF AMERICA

One bro’s
  totally  

factual,
awesome
essay. on
American
  history

‘Oliver Bateman
Columnist

 

[Editor’s note: The Moustache
Column of America, which is near-
ing the end of its three-year run
in The Pitt News, has been pre-
empted this week so that we might
present this (completely ﬁctional
but totally realistic) ﬁnal exam es-
say written by a freshman in the
U.S. History survey course who,
owing to how busy he was, never
attended a single class.]

1. Analyze the extent to which
TWO of the following transformed

American society in the latter half '

of the .20th century: the civil rights

movement, the antiwar move- »

ment, the women’s movement. .

OK, time to get down to some
real sh*t here. I’ve been Googling
history stuff all night, so you can
rest assured that I’ve got it down
cold. Plus, did I mention I took
AP U.S. History? Yeah, I was in
there. Abraham Lincoln, Eman-
cipation Proclamation, Constitu-
tion  you name it, I’ve probably
heard of it. Got a 2 on that test and
a 2 on some other test,‘ so that’s
4, which looked pretty good on

I ' my transcript (I also got into Vil-

lanova and La Salle, FYI). So I hope
you understand that with my AP
background and all the colds and
ﬂus and other injuries I have in-
curred, I just didn’t feel the need
to come to class'as much as some
other people who are healthier

and weren’t in as many APS as
me. You will soon see this is “no
problemo” grade—wise, and it will
all work out for the best.

- Anyway,_ for the starter (the-
sis), one of the big movements
in the United States of American
history was the movement for the
rights of civilians as well as sol-
diers (this is the thesis). As you

and I both -know (you, being the A’

teacher, should know it as well as I
do), there are many of these in the
United States of America. Some
of the rights, such as the right to
bear arms, come directly from
God. Others, such as freedom of

speech, are good commonsense. _

Can you imagine what life would
be like if we were never able to say
what we wanted to say? How could
I even write this exam?It boggles
the mind. Look it up if you don’t
believe me. .

‘In other words, there are so

‘many rights, and they are con-

stantly on the move. Where are
they going? I don’t have a clue. I
might be a little superstitious, but
I can’t tell the future. However, I do
believe that one of the big rights
that’s coming down the pipeline,
if you’ll excuse my little pun, is
the right to be 42o—friendly. This
is supported by, among otherlbig
names, Ron Paul, the candidate
for president. It is also supported
by me and my bros, since it is a
nice alternative to drinking Old
Milwaukee and doesn’t give you
such awful headaches and explo-
sive diarrhea (just the munchies

LOLI). Another right that is in the
works is the right for gay mar-
riage, which is OK just as long
as the government doesn’t try to
force that on me (no homo srslyl).

, I was told after a recent arrest that
I had the right to silence, which is ‘

another right that is often so easy
to take for granted.

Now, along with those rights
comes the antiwar movement.
I think this is either a misprint
(typo) or maybe you mean we’re
moving away from-how great we
were when we “ran a train” on all
those other punk nations (China,
Europe) when they tried to take
down the rights the way the Un-
dertaker is going to try to take
down Triple H at the upcoming

4WrestleMania (undefeated streak

FTWI). Back before the “move—
ment” to antiwar, the United
States of America was constantly
warring.'These wars, as seen in

.“V\_Iar Horse” and “Band of Broth-

ers,” were undoubtedly some of
the most important historical
events imaginable. In fact, when
I think about history at all, I think
about the big wars and how much
of the history of the United States

Senirs help tortrlansform club lacrose  

Courtesy Pitt Club Lacrosse

junior Tyler Novotny (N0. 14.) transferred to Pitt from St..]ohn’s, where he playetl NCAA lacrosse.

' By_[asper Wilson
Staff Writer

Four years ago, the Pitt club lacrosse ,
V team wasn’t committed to winning. ‘
Instead, senior captain Chris Gor-

ham said, the Panthers seemed to
play for fun. - . ~
But during the past four seasons,
Gorham and his classmates have
worked to change that mentality,
and now, in his ﬁnal season, Gorham

said he has seen the club’s transfor— -

mation from a team in shambles to
a successful program.

He wants to see that progression
continue. ' ' .

“We wantthis program to be
serious,” he said. “We’ve set the
example. We’ve said this is what
Pitt lacrosse is.” «-

Head coach Alex Perry said the
team’s players are “light—years ahead
of where they were last year.” The

Panthers — a Division I club‘ team ’

— are 7-1-1 overall with a 4-1 record
in the Central_ Collegiate Lacrosse
Association, which consists of eight
Division I teams and 19 Division
II teams from Indiana, Michigan,
Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Club sports teams compete with .-

teams from other universities, but
their athletes aren’t on athletic

-scholarships, and the teams aren’t I

governed by the NCAA.

Pitt lacrosse’s only loss this sea-
son came against then-No. 12 Mich-
igan State, 17-16, but Pitt scored
three goals in the last two minutes
ofthe game "to force overtime. The
close score was a change from past
meetings against the Spartans.

Michigan State ended Pitt’s sea-
son in the conference. playoffs last

year. During the 19-3 defeat, Perry.

said that the Spartans ran up the
score and left their starters in for
the entire game.

“They disrespected us last year,” ‘

Perry said. “Plain and simple.” A
. Senior captain Nick Ruff said
the team’s performances against

‘Michigan State and 12-10 win

against No. 10 Buffalo the night
before show how the far team has
come in four years. 7 _

Pitt hasn’t beaten Buffalo in
10 years and Michigan State also
defeated Pitt two years ago in the
playoffs by the lopsided score of
18-3.

Senior captain Nick Ruff said
that during his freshman year the
team lacked chemistry, which hurt

the Panthers when they played

tough opponents or tried to earn

a come-from-behind win.
He said that the close-knit na-

ture of the team off the ﬁeld this

seasonldeserves a large amount of.
credit for its improved performance

' on the ﬁeld.
V “A lot of the team did not hang‘
out outside of playing [before],”

Ruff said. “However, now the team
is extremely close, and we don’t
need to make-it a point to hang out
outside of playing because we are
all really good friends, which makes
for great team chemistry.”

Despite the improvement on the
ﬁeld and off, team members said
that they will only View the season
as a success if they [qualify for the
Men’s Collegiate Lacrosse Associa-

tionnational championships. The »

MCLA is a national.organization
consisting of more than 200 club
lacrosse programs.

In order to qualify, the team
must win either the CCLA confer-

_ ence playoffs or receive an auto-

matic bid from the MCLA. Auto-
matic bids are given out on the basis
of a team’s record, victories over

Choosing a favorite team 
from the Premier League  

By Greg Trietley
. Senior Staff Writer

I know nothing about the Eng-
lish Premier League, and I don’t
pretend to. ‘

But there’s no denying that the

‘ league’s popularity in America
_ has grown to the point where I, as

someone who can name maybe 10

V players, feel like an outsider.

So I need to adopt a team. '
I have a list of the 20 EPL
teams in alphabetical order,

‘along with a few historical facts

about each_. I have this season’s
standings and rosters, although
I want to avoid selecting a team

bracket. The

I’d like to drive,
defeats Wigan,

time soon and read “The Hunger”

Games” trilogy next summer.
In my next first-round battle,

Aston Villa, which sounds like

a car I’d like to drive, defeats

‘ Wigan, possibly the fifth Hog-

warts house. _

‘My third matchup presents‘ a
problem: I like the ring of both
“Blackburn” and “West Brom-
wich.” Therefore, I’m abandon-
ing my alphabetical bracket and
selecting both the Rovers and the
Albion. 

The other four teams I want in
my Elite_Eight with Aston Villa,
Blackburn, West Bromwich and
Wolverhampton are the Queens
Park Rangers, Everton, the

I understand, an option —

most Ameri-

or ManchesterAUnited, as these
franchises have hefty payrolls

and, therefore, win more often _

than not. The three teams com-
bine for 57 wins, 16 draws and 15
losses this season.

These teams seem like the
Yankees and Red'Sox of soccer.
The fan bases bicker — “Chelsea

is a bunch of divers!” or “Arse- 7

everyone else quietly‘ pulls for the

At this point, I should reit_e_r-

cause the team is called freakingm

singer or"‘Off_‘1ce Space” charac-
ter, plays some role in the Bolton
Wanderers franchise.

Time for arbitrary seeding:
Aston Villa vs. West Bromwich,‘
Blackburn vs. Bolton, Tottenham
vs. Wolverhampton and Everton
vs. Queens Park.

My EPL knowledge largely
stems from the movie “The
Damned United,” which focuses 7
on Leeds United and Derby Coun-
ty in the early 1970s. Both these

- franchises, though, have since

been relegated to the Football
League Championship, which .

Pitt sophomore pitcher Ethan Mildren
received College Sports Madness Big East
Player of the Week honors on-Tuesday.

College Sports Madness is an indepen-
dent website that reports on college sports
teams from across the country.

It’s the second award for Mildren this
week, as the Big East Conference named
him Pitcher of the Week on Monday. Mil-
dren pitched a complete-game, 6-0 shutout
against Cincinnati on Saturday.

He allowed four hits,.collected seven"

strikeouts and walked just one batter in the

Panthers’ win. His performance led Pitt to

Pitcher Ethan Mildren received College Sports Madness Big East Player ofthe Week. .

its ﬁrst Big East Conference victory of the

season.

“Ethan had a great outing. We really need-
ed it,” Pitt baseball head coach Joe Jordano
said in a Pitt news release. “It was a must-win
game for us, and he did a tremendous job.
Acknowledging his performance was well-
deserved and appropriate.”

Just two Bearcats reached scoring posi-
tion in the Panthers’ win.

Mildren —— who leads Pitt’s pitching ro-
tation with a 3.65 ERA — has thrown 16
straight scoreless innings. On March 24,
he started against Notre Dame and allowed
three runs in the ﬁrst inning, but the Fighting
Irish_didn’t score for the rest of the game.

He’s the ﬁrst Pitt player to be awarded
Pitcher of the Week this season. 3

to travel also play a factor.
Sixteen teams qualify for-the MCLA tour-

nament, which will be held in Greenville, S.C., _

this season. i . ,
While Ruff said that chemistry between
€~,,_team members has greatly improved Pitt’s
‘ chances of reaching the MCLA tournament,
' Gorham said that discipline has played a de-
ﬁnitive role in the team’s success as well.
A 24-hour “no alcoholic substances” rule
before games 4 not in place during his fresh—_
man year — has increased clarity onthe ﬁeld,

Gorham said, and has provided opportunities
for team bonding.

Transfers have also helped the team .

improve, as they have aided the group’s re-
structuring efforts by bringing an element
of seriousness. ‘

_ Junior captain Tyler Novotny played Divi-

sion I NCAA lacrosse at St. John’s for a year

before enrolling at Pitt the spring semester
of last year. Novotny has amassed a_team—

high 36 goals and averages 5.88 points per

game. -
He said he’s seen a marked improvement
in the team’s work ethic over the past year.
‘ “This year we’ve reallyptaken everything a
lot more seriously,” Novotny said. “Everyone’s
not cashing in for the summer like they were

last year goingginto the playoffs.”

- The team practices four times a week:
Mondays and Wednesdays in the Cost Sports
Center on upper campus, often going from
midnight to 2 a.m., and Tuesdays and Thurs-
days on the intramural ﬁelds behind the Cost
Center. . .

. The team has ﬁnished league play, and a
likely rematch with Michigan State in the con-

ference tournament awaits. The match will

decide who wins the conference’s automatic
bid to the MCLA national tournament.

' “We havethe skill anddepth to beat Michi— '
