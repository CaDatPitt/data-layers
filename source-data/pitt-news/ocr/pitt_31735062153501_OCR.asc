DISTRICT mums MAKES?
ADDRESS T0 ASSEMBLYI

I
Last Friday morning at the regular 
weekly assembly Hon. W’. H. S. 
Thompson of the United States Dis-§f
trict Court spokeon the subject of the 
“Defendant and the State.” The prin—i
cipal theme of his address was thel
reason for eliminating capital punish-
ment. '

Judge Thompson said in part:

_‘‘Man has now reached a civilization
which we believe is the highest yet
attained. This is a civilization where
truth is preserved and where the best
lives live on after death. The Roman
Empire has long ago been buried and
the inquisition is still felt. In fact the
presence of all wrong continues to be
felt throughout the ages.

“The question which confronts us
in this civilization in which truth
plays such an important part is
whether or not man is capable of self
government. It is true that men are
created equal and endowed by the in-
alienable rights of life, .liberty,. and
But the affairs
of thousands of men must be regulat-
ed and this furnishes thousands of
problems.

“Heredity and environment are the,
forces which determine the good andﬁ
bad members of society. AThe bad
members of society must be checked
and this is done by the other members
of society. The legal objects of pun-
ishment are to punish the criminal
and to prevent others from slrifering
from crimes. In the past the methods
of inflicting this punishment were ex-
tremely cruel. Slow death in an iron

cage, the burning of the criminal’sl

feet by compelling him to walk bare-
footed on red hot coals, the guillotine
and the breaking of bones on the
wheel were common forms. The elec-
tric chair and the_ scaffold are but;
modern forms of inflicting this pun-
ishment. I declare that this is com-
pletely out of harmony with our mod-
ern civilization. And as the ball and
chain, the dungeon, the wheel, and
those other terrible instruments of
death which were well known in past
ages have all passed away, so are -the
electric chair and scaffold doomed
because they have no place in our
modern ci,vilization.- V
“'W.”nen the human race advances
further up the inclined plane of civil-
ization men will realize that such pun-

Dr. mum TALKS 
TO NEW mu cuss

......_—.........‘

Last Sunday morning in the Church
of the Ascension, Ellsworth avenue
and Neville Street, a men’s Biblel
Study class was organized. Twenti-
ﬁve men, including many Pitt students
were present at its ﬁrst meeting.

Dr. Francis Newton Thorpe, Pro-
fessor of Political Science and Con-
stitutional Law in the University, is
the teacher ‘of the class. He has a
very wide knowledge of the Bible,

his listeners in an original manner.

The class is non-sectarian and its
aim is -to supply the need of the com-
munity. The work will be conﬁned‘ to
the relation of the Bible to our every
day life, so that -the comforts and
blessings in the Book of books might
be more fully realized by those who

The «class starts promptly at ten
o’clock every Sunday morning and
lasts “for forty minutes, so that those
who wish to go to the morning service
at another church may do so.

Following the close of the talk last
Sunday’ morning, William T. Canan
was elected Secretarygof the class.

PENN STATE ,
DEFEATS PITT’S .
NEW MAT MEN

(Continued from Page ti

Reilley managed to keep the State
man of the 125 class on his head for
the period of ﬁve minutes, but at the
end of that time he fell into a trap
and lost out to the State man. Huff
chased Long through six minutes of
gruelling work but ﬁnally was caught
and ﬂoored by the State 1315 pounder.
l\/l'cNvamee, Pitt’s mysterious marvel,
lost his encounter in the 145 class

to Dale, of the opposing aggregation.

“Jimmie” Jones put up a fast battle
with his man but died a game
death after four minutes of gruel-
work. _‘Stahl, the new Juan

made himself solid by staying
with his man to within ﬁfteen seconds
of the final whistle. Jock Sutherland
could not be thrown but lost to his

man on a close decision.

Coach Renicke has been on thejob
but a few weeks and announces that.
considering the time that he had the
men in charge, he was well satisﬁed
with the results of the meet. ’Wrest-
ling is an art in the athletic sense of
the word and can be acquired only by
years of hard toil and experience.
Consequently the loss of the team to
the State men cannot be laid to the
superiority of the State men except in
the Department of «experience and the
length of their coaching.»

The Navy Meet.
The Pitt men will have their mettle

tested to the very limit when they

meet Navy at Annapolis next Saturday
afternoon. Some weeks ago the Mid-
dies defeated the State men in almost
as decisive a manner as the State ag-
gregation hung it onto Pitt. It will
be seen by this comparison that the

' _Blue and Gold grapplers will have a

full schedule when they stack up
against Uncle; Sam's Maryland
charges.

It will be a different team that
meets the navy men from the one
which went down to the complete de-
feat ,at the hands of the Nittany
crowd. Renicke will have had a week
in which to reorganize his forces to

dmeet the assault of the future Ad,-

mirals and all are in’ full hope of ‘be-
ing able to make a better showing
against the sailor men than they did
when matched with the agriculturists.

The «tall and angular Mrs. Marshall,
in the person of J. M, Miller, caused
an unending amount of amusement-
among the feminine portion of the au-
dience. Another who got a ‘laugh near-
ly every time he appeared was I.
Spottem as -this supposedly crazy‘ man
was presented by S. E. Armstrong.

.Belle Ringer proved a rather noisy

«telephone operator as she crocheted
and posed to carry across the fem-
inine idea to her sisters in the audi-
ence. In this part P.“ D. Allen proved
that all are not girls‘ who are graceful.

Wilda Marshall was well played by
Alvin, Johnston who in the last {two
years‘ has mad.e quite a name for him-
self as a female impersonator.

Mlle. Nimblefoot, the dancer at the
Opera Comique was very gracefully
played by G. H. Gurley. And ﬁnally,
Latch Keyes in the person of E. P.

never losing his head.

Of the chorus, the only one who
got a chance to shine individually was
Foster Del-lart who did it with a ven-
geance in the Danse'de Bizarre.
