Kaufman Wins; Election Contestecl

/,

by SHARON SEXTON
’ News Editor

Rege Kaufman, a junior in the

School of Engineering, won the
election for Student ‘Government

A president, taking 30.2_ per cent of
the vote.

l

Kaufman was both “elated and

nervous” over his victory. “I'm 1

really excited about it. I cam-
paigned hard among the engi-
neers, the fraternities, and the
nurses, and I guess it paid off.”

Two petitions contesting the"

election threaten to invalidate
his candidacy and render the elec-
tion void.

Several students have filed a
petition with the Student.Govern-
ment Elections Committee con-
testing the election on the grounds
that Kaufman did not have the
necessary 300 signatures on his
petition to qualify him for candi-
dacy. They contend that Kaufman
should never have been placed on
the ballot, that his candidacy
should be revoked and that Ken

Steinberg, as runner-up, should

be named in his place.

of the Student Government Elec-
tions Committee, said, “The com-

Outlines Ecological Future

Ward Makes Predictions

“V by ANDREW J. SOPKO

Barbara Ward, one of the great
scholars of the world and one of
the most influential writers of
England, spoke this past Wednes-
day at the Carnegie Music Hall in
the Carnegie Institute’s continu-
ing series devoted to “Man and
Ideas.”

Her talk, entitled “Basic Con-
ditions for Tomorrow’s World,”
brought a sense of English ambi-
ance and oratorical wit to the
Music Hall audience. As an au-
thor, editor, and economist, Miss
Ward was one of the first schol-
ars to deal with the ecological
problem on an international scale.

Quite convinced that “we
haven’t changed all that much”
since the l830’s, Ward outlined
her rather optimistic view of the
world-to-come invregard to the
ecological problem.

In keeping with her humani-
tarian interests, Ward discerned
that “the risks of the future are
not physical but moral.” Pointing
out that there has been-a down-
ward trend in population growth
and an increasing reliance upon
substitutibility for exhausted ma-
terials, she‘ predicted that these

problems would not be limits to
man’s advancement.

“If there is anything by which
we will be limited, it will be by
our own lack of heart and soul,”
she stated.

Devoted especially to the devel-
opment of the emerging nations,
Ward stressed that it is our hu-
manitarian duty to provide for
these nations, perhaps by such
means as the allotment of sea
areas rich in resources. With such
allotments, according to Ward,
the burdens of the emerging na-

l tions would be lifted and the gen-

eral good of mankind advanced.

Suit Halts

by RICK INFANTE

With the decree for pare/liminary
injunction of Traffic Court being
drafted, the Legal Awareness
Committee (LAC) and Robert By-
er seem to have an important foot-
hold on the verification of their
claims that Traffic Court prac-
tices areinequitable.

In an open court hearing held
Wednesday in Judge Weir’s cham-
bers. Bob Byer. Wendell Free-
land. and Harry Scott strengthen-
ed their contention that substan-
tial reform in the city’s handling
of traffic prosecutions is needed.

The original complaint filed.

against Traffic Court accused the
agency of practicing “rubber
stamp” justice, issuing overdue
and illigitimate notices to ap-
pear, and excluding the basic civil
rights of confrontation and pre-
sumption of innocence. Wednes-

‘ day's proceedings attempted to

verify these claims.

Wendell Freeland, acting as pri-
mary counsel for plaintiffs. pre-
sented the main purposes of bring-
ing the class action; specifically,
to prevent lawless government.
Jeff Pasek of the LAC explained :’

mittee has received ‘the petition
and a meeting will he sailed to dis-
cuss it within the next ‘ew days.”

The petition which students
filed with the Elections Commit-
tee several days ago in regard to
the committee's decision that a
monetary transaction between
presidential candidates Rege
Kaufman and Dave Bluey was “an
untimely transaction between
friends” is still pending. That pe-
tition charges that the transaction
was not a gift or a loan but a
“bribe.”

In reponse to the petition con-
cerning the bribe, Kaufman ex-'
plained, “It is an absurd accusa-

tion.” He maintained that he was
not alarmed by the petition, “My
conscience is clear.”

Kaufman was unavailable for
comment on the petition concern-
ing the signatures.

If the Elections Committee
rules that Kaufman's candidacy
was invalid, according to the
Election Code, two options are
open to them: they can name

Steinberg president, by default,
or order a new presidential elec-

2 Suspects Apprehended

Woman Shot in Robbery Attempt 2  

by JOHN A. CAPITMAN ,

Carl Whitson, 21, of 339 Bur-
rows St., was arrested Wednes-
day afternoon and charged with
the armed robbery and murder of
Beverly Moore on Tuesday night.
Moore, a mother of four, was shot
on Fifth Ave. across from Tenny-
son St. in what police termed a
purse-snatching.

Robert Fulton, 20, of 1106 Mon-
tezuma St., was arrested later
that evening and is suspected of
being the «driver of the getaway
car.

The arrests were based on des-
criptions and a partial license
plate number provided by wit-
nesses of the crime.

Moore was enrolled in anon-
credit course in real estate devel-
opment held on Wednesday eve-
nings at Pitt. “

Joseph Gil, Superintendent of
Campus Police, reported that
Moore had been seen “walking
with the assailant, west of Fifth

Ave., with his arm around her
waist and his other hand across
her face.”

Eyewitnesses saw a flash and
heard the gun, according to Gil,
when the victim “fell into the
hedges bordering the Cathedral
lawn.” The witnesses reported
that the assailant ran down Fifth
Ave. and got into the passenger
seat of a car driven by a second
male. Police reported that the
car used in the robbery was regis-
tered under Whitson’s name.

The car headed down Fifthwith
its lights off, then turned up De-
Soto St. onto Terrace St. where
Gil reported it “almost hit the
car of an off duty campus police
officer, who pursued the car to
Robinson.”

There it turnediright and was
lost by the officer, who was driv-
ing a small compact.

The Campus Police received
telephone calls about the incident
from an anonymous male stu-

Traffic Court Practices

"The worst thing that a citizen
can suffer, even worse than being
a victim of crime by another citi-
zen, is to be the victim of a crime
carried out knowingly by the very
agency of government designed to
protect civil liberties.”

Freeland examined various of-
ficials and clerks connected with
-Traffic Court and pieced their
testimonies into a fabric support-
ing the, plaintiffs’ allegations of
inequitable treatment. Under-
graduate Robert Byer and third-
year law ' student Harry Scott
(husband of plaintiff Elain Scott)
successfully‘ argued the various
procedural points. i

After attempts trying to estab-
lish legitimate legal grounding for
the Traffic Court’s actions, defen-
dants’ counsel, Dan Curtin, Assis-
tant City Solicitor, capitulated to
the plaintiffs’ claims and asked
Judge Weir only to recognize that
the city was acting in “good
faith.” -

The preliminary injunction
against Traffic Court will most
probably have the effect of ‘sus-
pending the court’s arresting cap-
ability’ and its capacity to call

hearings. Bob Byerexpects def-I

inite corrective action. Between
the issuance of the preliminary in-
junction and :the real possibil-
ities of a permanent injunction, he
sees the city’s Traffic Court man-
agement scrambling to plan ma-
jor reforms. ’

Reflecting on the impact of this
class action complaint, Byer felt
that his petition prevented “the
city from acting in flagrant dis-
regard to people’s rights and mak-
ing a buck on it.”

Sokoloff said Tuesday. "We
thought that this would be a cere-

because of the Vietnam War sit-

the country.

very sensitive to lines like these.”

The composer said the 11-min-

pleted and only made a general
reference to war.

the beginning of construction of a
new Nationality Room, the Israel

ning since 1965. It has been co-
ordinated by a committee in Is-
rael, a committee in Pittsburgh,
and the University. it

Tarajan, a Hungarian immigrant
to Israel, were chosen for the
room.

The Israel Room will be found
on the first floor in the Cathedral,
off the Commons Room. Its win-
dows will overlook Fifth and
Forbes Aves., in an area which is
presently a suite of offices. The.
room will be the same size as the
English Room, with a capacity of
60-75 people.

The main concept of the room
is the contrast of the desert and
its flowering. This will be repre-
sented in the decor by a ceramic
wall abstractly depicting the des-
ert and Hebrew quotations. On an
opposite 16' by 16? wall, a tapes-
try will depict the third day of
creation. »

Created under the direction of
Heddi Tarajar. The principal sym-
bolgwill be the Menorah, a candle-

The committee in Pittsburgh is

composed of interested commun- -

are sponsoring a concert to-
night at 8 p.m. in David Law-
rence Hall in an attempt to raise

Marga Society to raise money for
the Nicaraguan Relief Fund.

Featured in this concert will be
Glass Harp, a well-known Cleve-
land group; the Stocker Brothers

at the door.

However. "not only will money
be supplied as a result of this and

A “Pershing Rifles" Unite People

by DENNIS P. MCMANUS

At Woodstock in 1969. Country
Joe and the Fish sarcastically in-
structed the crowd to “Throw
down your books and pick up a
gun. we're gonna have a whole lot
of fun.“ A similar suggestion was
made in 1891 at the University of
Nebraska by Lieutenant John J.
Pershing (later to be a World War
1 general. affectionately called
simply “Blackjack"). a profes-
sor of military science.

Seeking to "develop profession-
al officers.“ he initiated a drill
team which in 1894 was officially
named "The Pershing Rifles" in
his honor. The main activity of
this organization was, to conduct

1 drills and "foster a spirit of co-

operation between the military
department and the drill team. Af-
_ter the Second World War these
limited objectives were consider-
ably broadened. The expanded or-
ganization allow-ed civilian mem-
bership and sought to "develop
leaders.” In 1951. the Pershing
Rifles came to the University.

has steadily grown.

Consisting of 11 active student
members and numerous associate
members (including 2 members
of the Department of Military Sci-
ence and a long haired, bearded
graduate student) the Pershing
Rifles fulfills its threefold func-
tion. First, the Pershing Rifles is
a military fraternity. It draws
its membership from all branches
of ROTC plus other members of
the University community with
similar ideas. At the present
time. roughly half of the mem-
bership is civilians while the
other half is cadets.

Secondly, the Pershing Rifles
serves a socia-l function. Along
with their co-ed affiliate, the
“Pershing Blues,” they sponsor
various social events, including an
annual dinner-dance. Finally, the
Pershing Rifles is a service or-
ganization.

In service to the University. the

PR’s sponsor the “University
Drill Team." The team has an im:
pressive record in intercollegiate
drill meets, winning a trophy at
every one they have attended this
year.

In service to the community, the
PR’s and the “Blues" help with
various charity drives and at the
Veteran’s Hospital.

Bill Robinson. an officer in the

PR explained that there is "no
formal link between the drill

team. the PR’s. and ROTC. Mem-
bership is open to anybody." In _ . '~

an age when rifles are used ,to
kill thousands of innocent civil-
ians in Southeast Asia, patrons of
Howard Johnson’s in New Or-
leans. student protesters, and
bunny rabbits (in protesters. it is
encouraging that here at Pitt,

"Rifles” are being used to bring. 1

‘The Doughnut Clause

by GEORGE ZRUST , ‘
It seems that in about the past

 year or so, there has been a no-

ticeable increase in the number

7 of chain~operated doughnut shops
" in the Pittsburgh area. Naturally.

-doughnut-lovers such as myself
‘will hail this as one of the few

 , positive trends in the American‘
. society_which is so often called
 sick, corrupt, and generally on

the skids. But aside from the fact

 _that they benefit local sweet-teeth

 both -groups are on the road con-

and employ area teeny-boppers.

-ll‘.-__the'doughnut shops perform a

much more important social func-

‘ tion.

V This function. which is well-
known to the casual. keen-eyed
observer, is that of keeping city
police and Port Authority Transit
(PAT) drivers wide awake and
happy, so that they performtheir
vital jobs at optimum. '

Havingon occasion spent long
hours behind the wheel of a car,
I can easily understand why po-
licemen and bus drivers gravitate
to the doughnut shops. Men of

stantly for eight hours or more a_
day, and pay the price in bleary
eyes and saddle sores. And things

certainly don’t get ‘any easier
when the officers are called upon
to cool a “cooking” high school,
or the_bus drivers are forced to
answer the same stupid questions
repeatedly. The doughnut s_hop,
with its shelves of sugary dough
and gallons of resurrecting cof-
fee, provides a welcome respite
from the rigors of a workday.

There are. to be sure. many
other patrons of doughnut shops

besides police and PAT em-,

ployees, but these are two of the
most visible types. I can think of
several local doughnut shops that
are often guarded by one or two
prowl cars or paddywagons. Not
too long ago I was riding a bus

when the driver pulled the ve— ‘

hicle into a shop‘s lot. set the
parking brake. and ran in for a
cupof coffee. Even on streetcars.
motormen have halted the cars on
busy streets, leaving them to mo-
mentarily tie up traffic. and have
done the same thing as the bus
driver. While I don't. honestly

know how widespread this type of
activity is. I should think that if it
is very popular, it should all be
formalized in order that unneces-
saryqconfusion and problems don't
arise.

Sorry, they were out of the jelly ones. '

For example. there is the prob-
lem- _of fellow employees who
might also wish to have a starchy
snack. but have non-traveling
jobs in thepolice station. bus ga-

__ rage. or carbarn. Since all police

cars have radios, and PAT ve—
hicles as a rule have them. this
means that drivers must take or-
ders over the air. There are so
many numbers involved in this
procedure. however. that it may
get unduly complicated. To dem-
onstrate. think of a voice crack-
ling over the radiophone and ad-
dressing a bus driver:

“Calling route 6_l-Charlie, num-
ber 2398, come in Charlie.” The
unsuspecting driver responds:

f‘Two-three-nine-eight here
reading you loud.and clear.” Then
the radio voice hits him with this:

“Seven of us guys here want
you to pick up 12 doughnuts for us ‘
before you come into the garage
tonight: five glazed. four choco-
one cinnamon. and two
cream-filled. Ten-four. over and
out." The driver. if he. hasn‘t,
crashed in the meantime. is left‘
wondering which numbers being’
where. and perhaps will end up

-buying 61 doughnuts. including ten

glazed and four cinnamon. He also
might just give up and concentrate
only on the little number behind
the counter at the shop. thereby
depriving the other men of their
snack.

With possible problems like
this. and others concerning job
time permitted for doughnut-
dunking and allowances for dry
cleaning to remove stubborn jelly,
stains from uniforms. it might be
wise for the respective unions to
bring up the matter at contract
time. Who knows. perhaps Pitts-
brugh will score a labor first by
successfully negotiating a Dougli—
nut Clause with transit operators
and policemen. I

meeting a request of the Univer-

more and better means of escap-
ing modern reality and its dread-
ful consequences to the students’
karma.

by JOHN AMSON CAPITMAN

A week ago Friday. the Pitt
News received a letter written.
apparently. in blood by a highly
literate possessor of a syringe
needle. Unhappily enough. the

letter was not only written in Ear— ‘
ly Sanskrit. but it was also left'

unsigned. The letter. which re-
quired the assistance of at least
three members of the Linguistics
Department to translate. was.
however. on the stationary of an
organization called YAFH (Young
Americans for Heroin) and was
accompanied by a cover note writ-
ten in Arabic. which requested
that the letter be published in its
entirety or not at all.

Though it is usually not the po-
licy of this newspaper to pub-
lish unsigned letters. 1 personal-
ly felt rather challenged by this
epistle‘s style. More importantly.
the letter seemed to contain so
many socially redeeming com-
ments that I felt the Pitt com-
munity would suffer’ greatly were

‘it to beheld down by its journal-

istic formality. So with these
thoughts in mind. I present as ac-

curate a translation as was possi- ‘

ble of the YAFH letter. and sin-
cerely hope that the community
at large will benefit from its gold-
en prose.

Dear Editor (or more closely:
Most highly honored newspaper
chiefs):

We the‘ members of Young
Americans for Heroin would like
to applaud the recent (in the near
pasti action of the University
Pharmacy in regard to the sale
of paraphenalia for- the aid of
consumers of our most profitable

product. canibis sitiva. We. how-

ever. feel that this action de-
serves ' better coverage by your
paper as well as some discussion
of its implications in terms of the
Oakland consumer and his needs.
First of all, we feel the need to
more clearly establish the usefull-
ness of the Pharmacy’s action—as
you may know they have over the
last several days sold approxi-
mately 150 waterpipes of various

suggests that the Pharmacy is

We strongly maintain. however.
that the Pharmacy's action must
be seen in a broader perspective.

..Simply this move may be seen in -\

the perspective of the American
free-enterprise system which is
based upon the healthy competi-
tion of equals. Such organizations
like U. S. Steel. the Mafia. and
the United States Government.
which serve the needs and desires
of the American people. were
‘built on just this kind of competi-
tion that the Pharmacy‘s action
will necessarily imply.

However. as in all such situa-

tions. we. the larger and better
established organization will
’make very legal attempts to buy
out the fledgling firm. Our line is
more extensive. not only do we
sell dope-smoking paraphenalia.
we also sell needles. spoons. bun-

son burners. and a wide range of
carefully quality-controlled intoxi-
cants——the Pharmacy‘s line as
yet only includes pipes. papers.
roach—clips. posters. and a small
assortment of mild amphete-
mine. So in short. like all good
American business men. we con-
gratulate the competition and will
continue to do so until itseriously
interferes with our market.

The members of YAFH would»
like to add a few further notes to
these basically positive remarks.
Firstof all, since the Pharmacy
is located in a University owned
building, it seems natural that
the money gained in this new en-
deavour will certainly be well
used in paying for the rent of the
space—money which we presume
will go back into the University
coffers, from whence it will
probably" be passed on to the stu-

' ‘dents in the form of University

training, the pre-requisite for en-

trance into the more lucrative

fields of American business life
-—it is only hoped that the Phar-
macy will include in every sale a
warning that studies must come
first and that such amusements
as drugs provide are nothing com-
pared to the pleasure of counting
money.

Finally, we would like to add a
word about quality control. We be-

. lieve that the consumer must be

told what the effect of using a
product will be. Our products. for
example. include very clear state-
ments which notify the consumer
as to the quanity of manure per
volume of canibis, or the quanity
of stricnine per volume of LSD.
We sincerely hope the University
Pharmacy's admirable entrance
into this exciting new market will
not be marred by failure to do the
same. ’

The Studio Theatre willpresent two plays from a woman‘s point
of view. opening this weekend. Written by Megan Terry. a woman and
author of Viet Rock, both plays fall into the category of transformation-
al drama. a form which utilizes switches in time. character. and sit-
uation.

Nicolette Gramatikos and Cathy Sakin. each directing for the
first time. have chosen Ms. Terry‘s plays. The Gleaming, Oh My Dar-

ling, and Comings and Goings, respectively for their debuts as direc— A

tors. They have been working with casts that include new and exper-
ienced actors. ' -

Both women termed their first outings at the Studioia success be-
cause of their satisfaction in having experimented with new techni-
ques and styles, and in getting people to work together. I ‘

Gleamingis more structured than Comings and Goings, dealing
with the relationship between two women living in a home for the aged.
Comings and Goings is built around improvisations describing differ-
ent interactions between women and men. They both use a comic ap-
proach to make serious points.

The productions are scheduled to run‘ this Friday. Saturday. and
Sunday, and next Thursday. Friday. and Saturday/in the Studio Theatre.
located in the basement of the Cathedral. People are advised to be
prompt since no one will be admitted after the curtain time of 8 :30.

Latest Release

America--Not Original

by BARBARA GERAUD
Rock Columnist

Last January. riding out of the
easton a "Horse with No Name."
three young expatriate Ameri-
cans surfaced out of England with
the year's smash single and
promptly rode their album to the
top of the charts.

Now America has gotten togeth-
er again for a second go—around.
aptly entitled Homecoming (War-
riors BS 2655).

Unfortunately, this album does-
not quite measure up to the stan-
dard set by their first effort. And
since they said the songs on that
first album were done six years
ago, it seems that in the interven-
ing time they could have come up
with something better than..this
one. »

Dewey Bunnell still sounds
more like Neil Young than Neil
does. and the group‘s harmonies
still have a (regrettable?) tenden-
cy to sound like the early Buffalo
Springfield. It's nice. but it‘s
copying.

"Till the Sun Comes Up Again."
“Cornwall Black." and "Do '
Cross the River” all sound Il?(e
something off the Buffalo's first
album. "Moon Song.“ especially.
sounds so much like Young’s “Ex-
pecting to Fly" that I keep expect-
ing to hear the’ rush of violins on
the fade-out.

They even threw in another enig-
ma of a line, a la “the heat was
hot” from “Horse with No
Name”; in “To Each His Own”
appears this line: “I’m gonna
miss you/yes I will; No matter
who you are/I love you still.”
Right.

\ .

Don‘t get me wrong. though,
this is a pleasant album to listen
to—nothing terribly profound in
the way of lyrics. and the arrange-
ments are mostly similar to those

on the first album. but it is nice to .»

relax to. '

But. shame of all shames.
they've even copped from the Bea-
tles — "Only in Your Heart"

sounding a lot like the Revolver- .

era music. features a cut-off fake

ending. then a sort of tape—loop re- -

verse fade-out. like “Rain." Then
they take Carole King's line from
"So Far Away"—“one more song
about movin' along the highway"
—and make it the center theme of
"Saturn Nights.“ Can‘t they do
anything original?

Another major complaint, the

album is only 33 minutes long.

There has been a trend lately to
make albums shorter and shorter

,,

while raising the prices on them,“
but this is a bit much. Despite the '

super-duper fold-out cover with
the mass collage of “America”-
type scenes, there should be more
music inside. 

Oh well. we’ll have to see what

they do live to know if they're ' 
worth anything without all the - 

studio techniques to add so much
sound to a three-man group.
They‘ll be at the Syria Mosque on
Feb. 21. another of Pat DiCesare's
Winter Festival concerts. I‘m

looking forward to seeing what ,  

happens.

 ; Last Tuesday at 6 a.m. the majority of the Pitt Hockey Club
arrived at the Alpine Ice Chalet for their regularly scheduled
practice session. When they stepped inside. however. they found
jtlia"-t»they were not going to have a practice session at all.

 It seems that Cliff Wise, proprietor of the Alpine. had chos-
'e_ri,to begin repair work on the boards——a new paint job. In short.
’.th"ose Pitt players that had dragged themselves out of bed at the
ungodly hour of 5 a.m. to be there were not permitted to take
the ice because Mr. Wise did not have the decency to contact
anyone on" the Pitt team to tell them about the repair work. A

Avenue High’s Dwight Clay hit on
a 25 foot jump shot, to send the
game into overtime, where Notre
Dame ran off with an 85-76 vic-
tory.

The game started out beautiful-
ly for Pitt. and with Billy Knight
paving the way. the‘ Panthers
broke a 4-4 tieinto a 12-4 lead.
The margin continued to expand.
and Pitt had a lead of better than
10 points throughout the first
half.

The screaming crowd didn‘t
bother Pitt. and neither did Notre
Dame's full court press. The Pan-
thers were repeatedly breaking
the press into two on one breaks.
and easy scores. Pitt coach Buzz
Ridl only used seven players in
the first half. so depth wasn‘y
hurting at that time.

Knight wasn’t hurting at that
time, or any other, for the entire
game. “Mooney” poured‘ in 22
points in the_ first half, along with
11 more in the second to lead all
scorers with 33. Pitt’s first half
shooting was 63 per cent.

turn in the second half. The Irish
whittled away at the Panthers
lead. but could not cut it below
five until the final minute. If the
clock had been run properly. Pitt
may have pulled off the victory.

Midway through the second

.half. the Irish brought the ball in

from the sidelines. but the clock
didn't start. “Tiger" Paul. an
avid Pitt fan sitting near the
bench. noticed it first. and by the
time he alerted the officials. 15
seconds had-elapsed. The offi-
cials took 10 off the clock. Re-
member Clay ..scored with four
left to tie it.

Soon, all of Notre Dame’s ad-
vantages began to be realized.
The full court ‘press was forcing
Pitt into turnovers; Knight could-
.n’t get open as much. And then
foul trouble set in.

Before the game ended. Keith
Starr and Jim Bolla had fouled
out. and Kirk Bruce. who had 14
points. as well as Ken Wagoner.
who had four. '

And the players Bidl would have

normally put. in as substitutes
were not there as he looked down
his bench. Carl Morris and Willis
Cardot were back in Pittsburgh
with the flu. Mickey Martin was

back in the hotel with the same"

ailment.

“Any one of them probably
would have made the difference,”
explained a dejected Ridl. “Willis
is good against the press. He does

_a lot of intelligent things. Some of
our players tried to make the .

proper choices, but they'didn’t.”

Complicating" matters was the
fact that Pitt ran out of timeouts
with 3:50 to go.. With 40 seconds
left. the lead was still seven. but
John Shumate. who finished with
24 points, drew a foul from Bolla
while shooting. and made the

three point play.

to the flu bug.

PSU Nittrmy Lions
In Home Event Sat.

by YAIER LEHRER

Sickness may play an impor-
tant part in Pitt’s swim meet
against Penn State at Trees Hall
pool tomorrow at 2 p.m.

With »Mark Winters. Jerry
O‘Leary, and Jim Howell. the
Cats‘ distance swimmers being
hit by the flu, it's going to be an
uphill battle against PSU. Dave
Natali was sent home from prac-
tice for being sick and it appears
that Dave Simeone and Jack Gar-
row may have also been bitten by
the bug.

George Hawes will be "back for"

this w_eek’s meet /in the srpint
events. The abysence was felt
against Bucknell and his perform-
ance in the meet should be a big
plus for them. -

Penn State is coming into the
meet with a 1-1 record, having de-
feated Lafayette and losing to Vil-
lanova. Penn State, as did Villa-
nova, finished behind Pitt in the
Penn State relays earlier this

i year.

Penn State has a very strong

freestyle relay and also has some .

good distance swimmers, such as
Lane Schuckers and Ray D’Ar-
dene. John Piatt is a strong con-

tender in the individual medley-

and the 200-yard butterfly. The

Lions also have a good diver by T

the name of John Iskat and the
sprint events are dominated by
Will Metzger in the 100-yard free-
style’ and Bob Morrical in the 50-
yard event.

Pitt’s outlook can be consider-
ed less than hopeful. With most of

‘the team being hit by the flu. it’s

going to be a tough job to put to-
gether a winning combination this
weekend. If the teams remains
healthy. then the outlook can be
considered good with Pitt favored
to win the meet.

The team has an almost unbeat-
able 400-yard medley relay, and
the divers are expected to put in
good performances. George Haw-
es’ return to the lineup could help
put the Cats into strong conten-
tion in the sprints, which would
make the meet a lot closer and
could give the team the winning
margin it needs.

Says Coach Bradshaw, “This

will be an exciting meet. Penn

.. T The “revolving door” substitution antics employed by
?*“;P__anther basketball coach Buzz Ridl this year has raised so
 much attention that perhaps the real reason for the hoopsters
 failure to pull off the big play and the big win has lingered un-
 noticed. "
 ‘_’ A look at the 1972-73 roster will, almost surprisingly, re-
[Tl-I-veal that the Panthers are an extremely young team and des-

I ‘perately lacking in overall team maturity.

'_ Before Wednesday’s near win at Notre Dame, Ridl’s young
uns had shown their inexperience at the opening of every game
-—methodically falling far behind in the opening minutes of ev-
 ery contest. At South Bend, the jitters worked the other way.
. The Cats found themselves with a high shooting percentage and
57 a substantial lead, but choked.

The only Panther that played all of last year and has played
all “but a handful of minutes this year has been Bill Knight, After
that, where is the continuity?  3‘ ’

After Knight, the team experience is owned by Mickey Mar-
 tin, Bill Sulkowski, Carl Morris, and Ken Wagoner. To remem-
‘;j,.-ber last year’s games is to conjure up images of these four ath-
 letes spending much of the time on the bench. -

 - Martin wasn’t discovered until the Syracuse game, near the
i ’ T end of February. He was injured early and missed a lot of prac-
}:’'tice. Sulkowski shared the center post with Paul O’Gorek and
9 [in .1971-72 and this year is sharing it with Morris and Jim
-Bolla. ,

g Morris, a senior, who played well until succumbing to the
._ flu, has almost been absent from the picture of late. He too play-
-"fed .less than half the time last year——as he is doing this season.
';A Bolla, the starting center has very little court time behind him.
.7”He was hurt (broken arm) in the fifth game last year and has
 gained his playing time the first half of the current schedule.

A  Kirk Bruce and Willis Cardot are sophomores and had no
yfprevious varsity experience. And, Tom Richards and Keith
 Starr are mere freshmen.

V  Also, Wagoner and Sam Fleming. never accumulated much
 5 playing time between them. I
 This overall lack of experience has had to take -its tool. Iron-
ically, one of the most seasoned players on the team is Lucius
 Keese—he played two years of junior college ball—and every-
 body knows where he has spent most of his time this year.

  A Few Notes

Ernie Webster, Pitt’s former star offensive lineman is

[anxiously waiting for the professional football draft at the end
of this month. ‘ .

 ‘ . “Hell, the suspense is killing me. I’ve talked with a lot of

-éteams and I expect to get drafted. But, I've learned about ex-
pectations the hard way.”

  Webster was referring to the fact that he had been ignored

Fall Short OI’ ND

Cats Cool In Clutch

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

It seems almost impossible for a basketball
team that goes into the locker room at half time
with a 13 point lead, that for three-fourths of the
game can’t do anything wrong, could possibly turn
around and in a dramatic fashion lose the contest.

It does seem impossible, but then, Pitt has a
knack for doing impossible things like this.

In one of the Panthers’ most brilliant perform-
ances this season, they fell short in overtime to
finally drop the hard fought game to the Fighting
Irish of Notre Dame by the score of 85-76.

But that final score. could in no way describe
how the Cats played throughout most of the game.

The Panthers jumped off to their quickest‘
start of the season. They overpowered Notre Dame
with their fast running game, their topnotch shoot-
ing and expert ball handling. Pitt did everything the
Notre Dame basketball coach Dick Phelps feared
they would do and they did it well. I

No reins could be put on the Panther guns."

Pitt’s All-American candidate Billy Knight time
after time scorched the Irish defense in the first
half, burning Notre Dame for 22 points, before the
halftime buzzer sounded (by the end of the game
Knight racked up 33 points).

As Notre Dame’s sports information director
stated during the game, “Billy Knight is the best
player to play here this year.” He also couldn’t
say enough about a Pitt team that shot 63 per cent
during the first half.

The Panthers drove the Irish into the ground
and by the half were ahead by 46-33. This is the
farthest Notre Dame has been behind at the half all
year. Even against the mighty UCLA Bruins, they
were only behind by 12 points.

The Pitt squad continued to dominate the ac-
tion early in the second half and then suddenly went
flat.

The top shooters for the Panthers, Knight and
Kirk Bruce (who in the first half scored 10 points)
went cold and the Cats began to lose control of a

~ game they had had completely at hand.

The youth and inexperience of the squad fin-
ally showed through and the Cats succumbed to the
pressure.

The Panthers showed that they didn’t like to
work overtime but not the Irish. Overtime basket-
ball for ND is its forte—the overtime against the

Cats was its third this season.

The Pitt Squad can’t be denied the credit for an
outstanding performance. It was a sweet taste in a
sour season. But a victory would have been sweeter.

Pink Panthers Debut

The Pink Panthers, Pitt’s var-
sity women’s gymnastics team,
