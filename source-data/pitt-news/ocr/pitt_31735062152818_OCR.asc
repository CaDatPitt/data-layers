THE OFFICIAL STUDENT

Numerous Changes Result

-Fro m Return to Semesters

 

A P sent Group System to. be

Abandoned in College; Fresh-
man English Required.

TO ‘RAISE THE STANDARD.

Students! Now Registered in the
College May Use Either Ne
or Old System. ‘

Important changes in the curricu-
lum of the University, and more
especially of the College, will be an
accompanying feature of the proposed

- return to the semester system. Under
~ the new rules, the old plan of groups

in the classical courses will be abol-
ished and the only required subject
will be freshman English. In the new
system, there will be distribution
ﬁelds. The changes in the system are

, based upon a close study of those

now used by Harvard and Chicago

' universities.

In addition to a major subject of
thirty-six credits in one department,
and a minor of eighteen, twenty-seven
credits must be secured in each of the
distribution ﬁelds, exclusive of the re-

-quired entrance subjects and of the

courses counted in satisfaction of the
major requirement". These distribu-
tion fields are four in number, langu-
age, literature, ﬁne arts, and music;
mathematics, philosophy, and psychol-
ogy; history, economics, political and
social science; and natural science.
Twenty-seven credits are required in
some modern foreign language, sec-

'ondary school courses to be included.

Where Latin or Greek is offered at en-

« trance, eighteen such credits may be

submitted, and ei hteen others in
some other foreign anguage, ancient
ern.

Before the end of the ﬁrst year,

. each student must submit a tentative
.plan of study for the rest of his

course. As soon as his major has been
‘selected, his advisor is to be a mem-
mf that department.

e 've courses of the school of Ed-
ucation available for college students
‘will include household economy, and
industrial. arts. .. Other
courses in the other schools may be

elected upon approval of the advisor

and Dean, provided that not more than
forty-ﬁve credits are in vocational
‘subjects.

Another important change is the
provision placing a’ strict limitation
upon the number of credits per term.
Students desiring degrees in. 1916,
1917, and 1918, are permitted to em-
ploy either new or former system in
their courses, providing that they "do
not offer more than sixteen credits
per term towards graduation. Such a
provision requires twelve terms work
for a degree, but it is preﬁmed that
such a limit can be imposed only after
thesummerterm of 1915, when the
new system goes into effect.

Two important changes are also
proposed in theentrance requirements
of the University. The ﬁrst is the
requirement of three units of foreign
language from all entrance candi-
dates. The second change is the pro-
Vision for more advanced standing in
physiography, Greek, civics, econom-
ics, Spanish, domestic science, and
other approved subjects, a limit of
four units being placed on vocational
subjects.

, PROF. GIBBS DISCUSSES

“DRAMAS OF ROSTAND.”

Speaking on the “Dramas of Ros-

ltand,” Prof. Lincoln R. Gibbs, head of

the English department addressed the
fhilo-Dramatists Sunday afternoon at
3 o’clock in the Hotel Schenley. Prof.
Gibbs has made a special study of
Rostand’s work, and in his talk he
analyzed the brilliant technical qual-
ieies and poetic charm that make the
French dramatist’s work so delight-
ful. The Philo-Dramatists will hold
their . annual banquet in the Hotel
Schenley in May.

WILLIAMSON ON ‘ 
ROAD TO RECOVERY.

Latest advices from the West Penn
Hospital relate that fact that G. M.
Williamson, known to all the inhabit-
ants of the University as “Chalky,” is
fast recovering from the effects of the
operation of some three weeks ago
and will soon be able to return to his
work.

Williamson spent a very hard day
last Friday, but has since improved so
that he is now able to be up for a
short time each day and will probably
berhome by the end of the week. Some
three and a half thousand of his‘
friends, associates, and admirers in
the University will be on the job with
the glad hand to welcome him back
wllilenlhis health permits his return to
so 00 .

THE FORTY-SEVENTH
WONDER or THE WORLD.

 

Ye gods and little ﬁshes!!! Whom
have we here? We've heard of Noah
and the Whale, Jonah and the Ark,
Columbus’s discovery of Rome, George
Washington in the Maxixe Girl, Abe
Lincoln and George _Cohan in their lat-
est comic specialty, the PITT WEEK-
LY sporting Editor, the Board of
Control and all sorts of other ‘queer
things, but here is something that is
absolﬁtely, scintillatingly new!!! Some
aspiring young god, in the freshman
class of the School of Engineering,
scorning the time-honored and vener-
able customs of that ancient institu-
tion, has so desecrated the sacred tra-
ditions of his beloved Alma Mater as
to walk away from a course of eight
genuine studies, including Math,
Graphics, Chemistry, and the rest of
the tortures preferred for his daily
exercise by the master of the under-
world, with eight solid toil-besmeared
A's. Nothing can surprise us now. A
joke in the Panther wouldn't even pro-
duce a good-sized jolt. Nor is that
all! Another member of this proper
and decorous institution of learning—-_-
and one who ought to have known
better—-has also declared himself an
enemy of ‘peace and progress by cap-
sizing_ six more A’s, with no other
members of the alphabet attached.
The ﬁrst answers to the whistle of A.
Mason Morris, of Elizabeth, Pa. when
noe one of his sacrilegious visits, and
is the first freshman in the history of
the school to commit such a crime.
May his piety forgive him!!! The

after thou shalt be known as Zeke,

Boys Will Make Another At-
tempt to Defeat the Debat-
ing “Jinx.” _  ‘

  

 
 

With the loss of the Geneva con-
test and both ends of the triangular
debate with W. & J. and Penn State,
the debating teams representingcthe
University passed the most disastrous
week in their history and also sustain-
ed the ﬁfth straight defeat of the
season._ While the teams in all cases
made hard ﬁghts, the ﬁnal ptunch
necessary to secure a decision seemed
to be lacking and Pitt secured but one
vote in the three debates, the decisions
being unanimous at ‘home and at
Beaver Falls, with a two to one ﬁght
at Washington. '
. . Last Tuesday evening, the ﬁrst girl’g
debatingteam to represent Pitt jounr- I
neyed to Beaver Falls to meet the
men’s team from Geneva. After a
hard struggle, which the girls are said
to have won, the judges surprised the
audience, vexed the young ladies, and
dumb-founded their opponents by
awarding the latter the decision. The
judges of this debate were Attorney

AUTHORITY nus   
or PRISON l|FE

“Thomas Mark Osborne, and what
he has done for the Prisoners at Sing
Sing,”!was the subject for discussion
by S. C. Schmucker, Professor of Bi-
ological Science in West Chester State
Normal school, at the assembly last
Friday. - if 

Mr. Schmucker spoke of the’ im-

provements that Mr. Osborne had seen
ﬁt, to install in this prison of Sing
Sing which containssome of the worst
criminals in the world. He gave the
students a resume of the conditions
that existed at the jail situated in
Auburn, N. Y., before Thomas Osborne
took charge, and traced the develop-
ments down to their present‘ condi-
tions. ,
Mr. Schmucker said in part: “At the
time Mr. Osborne took charge of this
jail the prisoners were treated like a
bunch of animals. The men were not
allowed” to talk to each otl er. They
were tied up together day 1" ,7 day, and
could not say two words to each
other. The officials believed that the‘
prisoners would conspire if left alone.
To do this, the men penned up as they
were in these iron walls, had learned
to talk to each other in «such a way
that the guards could not understand
them. Nature had found a remedy so
that these men could converse with
each other, although restricted.”
He then went on to tell of the many
‘trials and hardships that the present
warden of this great institution had to
undergo in order that he might be able
to learn some of the truerconditions
existing at the penitentiary.

“He was set to hard work, and was
required to make baskets. He was
sent to the ‘dark.’ This word is hated
by every inmate of the institution. It
is a dungeon with no windows. One
cannot see the light of day, only if
perchance it is opened to admit
another prisoner to this hell. After
he came out, he said: ‘These plans
had to be changed. These fellows
have to have a chance to have
the honor system among themselves.”
They adopted a plan drawn up by
some of the men considered the worst
criminals in the institution. Four
days after the proposal 1100 of the
fourteen hundred men who had signed
the scrollof honor could be seen play-
ing around freely. ‘

“It was the next Sunday'that I vis-
ited the institution, and the thing that
struck me when entering was the song
they played, namely ‘Hail, Hail, the
Gang’s All Here.’ This is the spirit
that prevails at the institution today.”

CONTEST ON FOR
SWIMMING TITLES.

 

The University contests for the
swimming championships will be held
the week of April 12th, in the gym.
The. events include the short dashes
and also fancy diving and the plunge
for distance. The 100-yard title has al-
ready been won by W. W. Swope, when
he made the distance of 1:01, at the
Varsity Club meeting. These events
are open to all the students in the
University and include numbers -for
novices only. Last year was the most
successful meet that has ever been held
and an equally large number of en-
tries are expected this year.

On the same evening that the Uni-
versity championships are being held
the annual interscholastic swimming
meet will take place. Many of the
high schools and-prep schools of west-
ern Pennsylvaniahave already entered
teams in this meet. The winners of
the different events will receive med-

COLLEGE HOLDS
  ns ANNUAI.
   F§_I_\_§T

.  and ‘Earnest Combined by
Speakers in Honor of College:

and University.

OLD ALUMNUS PRESENT.

- Decorated with penants and the
vari-colored dresses of the coeds and
those who were not coeds, the balcony
of the Rittenhouse was last Monday
night the scene upon which nearly a
hundred College representatives met
to enjoy the profusion of good‘ speech-
es, the intermingling of fun and sat-
ire, and also the production of the
East Liberty cookery. For the oc-
casion was the second annual banquet
of the College department at which
both faculty and students met to
show that the curriculum does not
compose both the alpha and omega
of a University education.

One of the features ofthe evening
was the presence of one of ‘the oldest
alumni of the College, George E.
Whitney, of the class of ’64, who came
as he expressed it “just to see how
things.were going on.” Such an oc-
ca_sion reminded him he said, of the
days when the ‘whole student body was
smaller in numbers than the present
department faculty.

‘ J. P. Heiner, of the class of ’15, was
the toastmaster of the occasion and,
although presented with a large cab-
bage head as an indication of his
prowess, proved himself to be a new
and better variey of that well-known
species. Owing to the absence of
Chancellor McCormick, Secretary S.
B. Linhart spoke on behalf of the Uni-

substitute for what: he characterized
his “accustomed position of speaking
in place of the Chancellor.” Dean J.
C. Fetterman represented the faculty
of the-College. He refrained from
telling the well-known “phenomena”
story, but handed his corps of teachers
so many boquets that Professor Per-
rin was compelled to carry his hat
when he left the building-

“Dick” Ahlers was scheduled to tell
“What it’s about,” but most of the
audience is still asking that same
question. The college quartette with
Gould, Hurrell, Cook and Franklin,
“made visible the invisible” by pro-
ducing some excellent music. The
sophomore representatives, Alma Mus-
ser and Morrill Cook, “came together
side by each, following one another,”
the former disclosing the mysteries of
dormitory life, and the latter present-
ing the bright and shinging stars of
the nineteen seventeen ﬁrmament and
proving himself by the way he dis-
covered these great planets, to be
quite an astronomer. ,

As a change from the literary ef-
forts, Irene Garrisonsturned the at-
tention of the audience to the phrase
that “music hath charms to soothe
the savage beast.” Although “Noth-
ing Much” was the unimposing title
of the next selection, the speech per-
petrated by J. D. Stark proved to be
the longest and most-inclusive effort
of the evening, ranging from gentle?
satire of the class senators to a sar-
castic accusation of all those mortals
whb come to. school for mere studies
without any attention to the student
activities. “Vanity Fair,” with a mix-
ture of complimentary, insulting, and
satirical’ remarks, was in honor of the

versity and proved himself a worthy

Edith Matthews, and Geneva by"Rob-
ert M. Isaac, Charles Carson, and
Sloan Martin. ‘

In the Penn State contest here last
Friday night, the aﬂirmative team was
again forced to bow in defeat because
of the prejudice in favor of the Mo
roe Doctrine. The State men, W. .
Diem,‘ W. R. Skillman, and B. F‘.-
Swartz, gained a «unanimous decision
from B. M. Selegman, F. W. Glaser,
and E. B. George, the judges being C.
D. Sully, Frank Flood, and R. L.
Thompson. V   _  
‘ The Pitt negative team. was like- 
wise ‘defeated at Washington’ by the A’.
W. & J. affirmative team composed of
King Alexander, Harry Dumnire, and’
Clyde Orr. Earle Reed, the original‘
captain of the team, had withdrawn
on account ‘of sickness, but was able
to aid his teammates by his presence
an dadvice. The judges were Dr.-C.
E. Snyder, H. G. Wasson, and because
of the failure to_ secure a third man,
Judge Irwin of the Washington ‘county
court. No alibis are offered for the
loss of this debate, a splitdecision be-
ing allowed to testify to the closeness
of the ﬁght, but the men are unani-
mous in declaring that nothing could
have surpassed the courteous and
sportsman-like treatment accorded to
them in their invasion of the home of
the Red and Black. The Pitt men to
make. the trip were L. M. Cook. Ben
Leucher, R. L. Spence, and E. C.
Kirker. _

Another attempt will be made to de-
feat-'the “jinx” of Pitt forensics. next
Friday night, .when an affirmative
team composed of J. C. Porter, Ben
Lencher, and B. M. Selegman will
meet the negative team from West-
minster. This debate will be held at
eight o’clock in 107 Thaw hall. The
Pitt men were defeated at,Westmin-
ster last year in a debate on the
question of immigration. This year's
debate is the same as in the others:
“Resolved, that the Monroe Doctrine
Should be Abandoned.” .

PITT PLAYERS CHOOSE
PLAYS"FOR SPRING WORK.

Three plays, “Dierdre,” “King
Archemenes and the Unknown War-
rior,” and “Esther,” were selected for
the ﬁrst work of the Pitt Players, at
a meeting of the club held last week. ~

The ﬁrst of these plays is a one act
drama by Wm. B. Yeats, and “King
Archemenes” is a drama by Lord
Dunsaney. Both of these plays be-
long to the Irish school and are com-' 
paratively easy to produce. “Esther” 
is a one act tragedy by Mr. G. M. P.  4:1.
Baird of the English department and"
organizer of the “Pitt Players.” The
scene of action is laid in Russia, and
the play depicts life of the Jews in
a Russian village. » g V.

The club will be divided into three . A
groups, each group to work on one of
the above plays. Those showing the
most ability‘ will be chosen for the
cast. However, even those that will
not be in the cast will have plenty of ’
work to do, as the mechanical side of
the performance will require careful
attention. - ‘ . .

WHAT'S THE ANSWER?

We have atended two debates with-
in the last week, which offered an in-
teresting comparison, and in some im-
portant respects, a contrast. One was
the Varsity debate between State and
Pitt last Friday night in Thaw hall.
The other was between two rival lit-
erary societies fro In Washington
Square and the Irene Kaufmann
Settlement. The former was attended
by a crowd liberally estimated at 150.
The latter attracted a gathering of
twice as many people, which packed a
good-sized room, both upstairs and
down. The audience at one‘ was com-
posed of faculty members, personal
friends of the debaters and a small pro-
portion of students. The other audience
contained practically all the members
of the rival constituencies, and the ad-
herents of both clubs. And the atmos-
phere! It was like going from a cold-
storage plant into a Turkish bath.
The spirit of those present at the

‘Settlement auditorium was efferves-

cent with cries of encouragement to
their respective representatives, which
could not even be curbed long enough
to admit of a musical intermission. It
only lacked proper direction to make

 it reminiscent of Forbes ﬁeld in No-

vember.
The debaters for the rival societies

'were, for the most part, experienced"

and seasoned men, making not their
maiden effort, but a well-planned and
unfaltering presentation of their reso-
lution.‘ It is far from our thought to
disparage any of our own valiant de-
baters, but the forensic record of the

OF KNOWLEDGE.

Opposition to the raise in tuition
announced recently and scheduled to
. go iiito effect next September, is more
thansever apparent in many quarters,

since the WEEKLY took up the sub-

ject last week. Letters which have

 been received indicate a strong feel-
, mg of indignation against the inequal-

ities of the proposed change. Speciﬁc
instances of cases where students will
be compelled to stop school temporar-

it ily or to go to other colleges, have

been mentioned. If an such will
state their grievances in etters to the
WEEKLY, they will be given atten-
tion. One consideration which should

-' be borne in mind when passing upon

the question is that the raise in ex-
Reuse is entirely independent of and

as no organic relation to the change
The $105

gestion has been made that if a raise
in tuition is absolutely necessary for
the health of the University treasury,
the raise should be made a pro rata
one, by schools, instead of being im-

'_¥:osed equally upon the School of

conomics, Education, and certain
courses in the College, as well as the

. schools where the new amount will not

be felt so keenly. This strikes us as

j being altogether more equitable, as
 well as practically worth considering.
.. Let’s hear from you!

CONGRATULATIONS!

 

And now what we have ‘exhausted

our destructive proclivity for the time

being, let us turn to a more congenial
subject,_ and offer our most -hearty
felicitations to the students of the

. College department, who attended the

Banquet monday evening at the Rit-
l5911l19i1?8e; and in especial, to the mem-
 Senate, who plan-

long to a school that can produce such
an occasion, and to a University which
has such a splendid nucleus at its
heart. V

GROWING PAIN S.

 

Almost coincident with the an-

nouncement that the PITT WEEKLY

willthereafter be published on Wed-

nesday of each week instead of Fri-

day, comes an increase in the size of

the paper, which it is believed will be

for the best interests of the publica-

tion as well as of its readers and all

concerned. It -was only a question of

time until the rapid expansion of the

University would force the student
and alumni organ to a corresponding

development. For a while It was'de-

bated whether the time was ripe _for

a more frequent rate of publication,

say for instance, that of a semi-weekly.

Taking all the circumstances into con-

sideration, however, it seemed most

feasible to make the advance in the

size of the single issue, rather than

in the frequency of appearance. The
WEEKLY has therefore been en-
larged to six pages with the present
issue, and will probably continue so
throughout the remainder of the year.
The extra inserted page is made pos-
sible by the ﬂourishing ﬁnancial con-
dition of the paper, and 3“ Inﬂux 01
new advertising. It has alwaY§ be?“
the policy of the WEEKLY to_ give its
readers the maximum _ possible for
their money’s worth, and the Present
instance is no exception. If the
WEEKLY were guilty of the indict-
ments that are sometimes heard made
against it, of being merely a private
gold-mine and source of graft for a
closed corporation of students ‘who
line pockets from the activities fees
of their fellows, such an_ action as the
present would be unthinkable. As
Billy Sunday so often remarks In
answering his bromidic critics who
hurl the mercenary charge upon him.
the best proof that we are not com-
mercialized, is in our staying in our
present business, which is that of
evangelizing the benighted _s’0I1dent
body of this grand and glorious in-
stitution. The increase In size simply
neutralizes the proﬁts that would
neutralizes the proﬁts that would oth-
erwise accrue to the_staif. It would
be possible, though difiicult, to keep on
with four pages. and by a process_of
unmerciful boiling and condensation
of the reading matter in our news c_ol-
umns, make allowance for the dimin-
ishing space which remains after all
our advertisers are taken care of.
With the extra two pages. however.
the WEEKLY will be enabled  offer
the students, faculty and alumni more
and better special features, with an
increase in art work, which has been
hampered during the present year bY
the restricted space. especially_ in the
domain of sports. The Alumni Asso-
ciation allotment will be increased to
almost a page, making possible many
new improvements andrfeatures of in-
terest to the grads, which Alumni Sec-

retary Davis has been revolving for
some time, but has not been able to

put into effect on account of lack of

room. The chronic croakers who have

seen, in the deference the WEEKLY

pays to the sporting page and its con-

tents. a discouraging symptom of the

deteriorating culture of the college

student, wil lbe given a measure of

satisfaction, in the fact that. although

the sporting department will now be

enlarged to practically a full page,

the proportion will be in that of one

to six, instead of one to four, as hith-

erto.

And so we are building for the
future, and we can conﬁdently forsee
in the not far‘ distant future, that
dream ideal of editors——THE PITT
DAILY.

Editor, PITT WEEKLY:
Dear Sir:

In regard to the recent action of
the Board of Trustees raising the tu-
ition for next year, I think the fol-
lowing points are in order. ‘

1. When a man is deciding on a

, college he considers the expense an

important item. It often decides
where he shall go. It is not a fair
proposition to offer a man a college
course at one price and later raise
that price. This is virtually a breach
of contract. » «

2. This University is asking the
state of Pennsylvania to give a large
sum of money for its use. In giv-
ing such funds, the commonwealth ex-
pects this University to serve the com-
munity and its people in an impartial
manner. By raising the cost of an
education, this institution tends to
make education for the wealthy class.
This is not only a return to a medieval
idea but it is betraying the trust
which the state and community have
placed in the University.

3. To speak plainly this University
is not offering value received for this
proposed raise in tuition. Very few
schools in'the country have a higher
rate than $150.00 per year. Pitts-
burgh is growing rapidly and we are
all proud of her but we do not have
the prestige, faculty, nor physical
equipment to warrant an increase.

4 If the receipts must be in-
creased and the enrollment cut down
is this not a left-handed method of
proceedure? Should not the Univer-
sity have high ideals for itself as well
as standing for public ideals?

A JUNIOR.
_ .
- April 12, 1915.
To theEditor of the Pitt Weekly:

The University’s debating teams
have taken part, this year, in ﬁve in-
tercollegiate contests, winning none;
out of ﬁfteen judges we have won the
vote of one.

There have been few men out for
debate, at any time, other than those
ﬁnally chosen to represent /us. It
has been almost necessary to place
on the teams any man presenting him-
self, this not being intended in dis-
paragement of the men who did make
the teams and who did their best work
for the University. The majority of
the men taking part in the debates
have been Freshmen; almost all have
debated for the ﬁrst time in the Uni-
versity, at least, there has been a not-
able lack of experienced material.

There are several men now in the
University who took part in debate in
previous years, including men who
last year were members of our suc-
cessful teams, who have this year fail-
ed to come out at all. There are a
great many other men eminently qual-
iﬁed. naturally, who have given no at-
tention to the subject. We have stud-
ents who could readily become debat-
ors of the ﬁrst rank, but they have so
far failed to exhibit any interest.
There is a great" deal‘ of general
complaint on the subject of lack of
interest and support on the part of
the student body. It would appear,
further, that there is more than a
little dissatisfaction on the part of
former and present debators with the
debatingsystem at Pitt, or with the
way in which debate matters have
been handled. There has been much
private discussion of the subject, and
the indications are that the men who
have participated in this activity are
for various reasons displeased with
the existing policy.

What are the real causes of this
dissatisfaction? ‘Is there really a lack
of interest in debating? The num-
ber of students who have recently dis-
cussed» the subject would point to a
contrary belief. The spirit of this
year’s student body, as a whole, has
been better than in past years. Is
there a’ debating enthusiasm of which
we have not availed ourselves? Are
we doing all that we can to bring the
best material, and all the good mater-
ial into service? Does not debate
offer a suﬂicient reward‘ for the time
and effort put into it? Is it not of
an eminently practical nature? Is
there any just cause for complaint as
to the present management and the
present coaching system?

Surely there is no other university
activity which so accurately indicates
the real eﬂiciency of the University as
debate. Certainly none ‘gives a train-

more permanency. Debate ought to
bring out the men who may be fairly
classed as the real leaders in thinking
and doing power, of the student body.
If, as many believe, we have not ac-
complished what we should have in
this 1 important ﬁeld, just ‘what is
wrong? It ought to be a matter of
concern to students and faculty alike.
Any Pitt man who can suggest a rem-
edy, or who believes that he knows
how conditions may be improved,
should make a real effort to bring his
ideas to the front at this time. 1916
can and should be a banner year in
debate, and we can, by beginning now,

in ’em.

Editor of the Pitt Weekly:

The loss of the debate at Geneva
was more than recompensed by the
vision of the ﬁne spirit of courtesy as
shown by our boys in the midst of our
defeat. All through the debate they
lent such encouragement as to make a
failure on our part seem impossible.
The manifestation of their belief in
us, their conﬁdence in our ability,
awakened all the more zeal and spirit.
We felt that we could not disappoint
that loyalty. But it was their atti-
tude in our defeat which we apprec-
iate most. Their splendid tact took
away the‘ sting, and on the return trip
their continued merriment dispelled
all gloom. In contrast with Geneva
men they shine! Truly we have learn-
ed to appreciate Pitt men.

THE GIRL’S DEBATING TEAM.

SOCIAL WORKERS I
MET AT INSTITUTE.

The April meeting of the Social
Workers’ club was held in the Assem-
bly hall of the Mellon Institute. Dr.
Samuel R. Scholes, Assistant Director
of the Mellon Institute, spoke on “In-
dustrial Chemistry as a Factor in So-
cial Progress.”

In his talk, Dr. Scholes developed -

the general thesis that the increase of
a nation’s\wealth is one of the most
important factors in the well being of
its people. He said in part:

“Too often we are inclined to take
the inventions and discoveries, the re-
sults of which we all enjoy, for grant-
ed, as though they were matters of
happy chance or mere coincidence. It
is well to call attention to the fact
that more often they are the result of
deliberate, painstaking research. In
like manner, we often regard the
sciences as well ordered collections of
facts and laws, interesting from an in-
tellectual standpoint-—an end in them-
selves. Therefore, it is also advisable
occasionally to point out that the
sciences are forever proving to be the
most eﬂicient tools by which man
alters his environment for his own
lasting, material good. For it was
not until the sciences, especially the
physical sciences, were actively called
into use that any of the great modern
inventions came to be‘. Until men
proceeded by logical processes to
group the facts of _nature into the
organized structures of the sciences,
invention proceeded with slow and un-
certain steps. Especially is this true
of chemistry. that century-old infant
among the sciences. The last one
hundred years have witnessed wonder-
ful forward strides in the arts, and
the wealth of the world has increased
enormously. It is signiﬁcant that the
rapid growth of the wealth of the
nations dates from the same period
as this growth of the science of chem-
istry. When the nineteenth century
began, our great grandfathers did
their scanty reading by the aid of
candle light and believed, if they took
thought of the matter at all, that the
candle burned because it contained
mythical element they called phlogis-
ton. Today we have the luxurious
comfort of modern chemistry, the
tungsten electric lamp, and ou_r chemi-
cal books alone would outnumber the
entire libraries of that early day,
while the true explanation of ﬁre is
known to every school boy.

So valuable a part is played by
chemistry‘ and chemical manufactur-
ers today, that we sometimes estimate
the relative importance of nations in
the industries,by"their production of
that very important chemical, sul-
phuric acid, which we may call the
most important substance in the in-
dustries, next to pig iron.”

Dr. Scholes went on to show that
the United States has been content to
take the cream of its natural re-
sources, disregarding to a great ex-
tent the utilization of waste, and has
exported quantities of raw materials,
allowing other more pains-taking

people to work them into «useful pro-’ .

ducts. -

He said that it was this condition
of industry that lead Dr. Robert Ken-
nedy Duncan to establish the Indus-
trial Fellowship System, under which
the Mellon Institute operates. It was
Dr. Duncan’s ambition to do some-
thing toward the permanent improve-
ment of American industry, to bring
science and chemistry more and more
to the direct aid of manufacturing.

Dr. Scholes then pointed out how
the Mellon Institute, through its work
on bread-making, on vegetable oils,
on the utilization of low.grade copper
ores, on the manufacture of glass
and on the production of gasoline from
low grade fuel oils, and in a number
of other ways, had contributed to Hie
development of industrial chemistry
and in turn to national progress.

that line the Commission has deferred

In the meantime Frank Jones is act-
ing as temporary secretary. He has
been the private secretary of Com-

THE ANNUAL ELECTION.

The list of nominations for officers
of the General Allumni Association
and members of Alumni Council, as
well as the alumni representative on
the Board of Trustees, as published in
the last issue of the PITT WEEKLY,
brought about much favorable com-
ment from the “grads.”

It is the general opinion that the
Nominations Committee has done its
work well and that, as a result, the
Alumni Council will be developed into
a very eflicient, hard working body
and that the attendance at all Council
meetings in future will be almost one
hundred per cent. For the 25 vacan-
cies on Alumni Council, there are 31
men nominated. These nominations
cover men for all departments and the
committee was careful to select those
who it was felt would devote much
time and energy to the oﬂice, if elect-
ed. The General Secretary can say
to the voters that no mistake will be
made in voting for any one of these
31.
The older alumni who have always
been loyal to Alma Mater in alumni
affairs but who have not had the time
to get to meetings, are taken care by
the honorary vice president positions.
The Nominating Committee has pre-
sented the names of nine men for

_, these positions and all of them are

prominent graduates who have made
their mark in the business and profes-
sional world. ‘We honor the Univer-
sity by honoring them.

._.o._.

For the beneﬁt of those who may
not be entirely familiar with the elec-
tion system, we give below a brief
resume of it: -

Nominations for the officers of the
Association and for’ members of
Alumni Council are to be made by the
Nominating Committee appointed by
the Chairman of Council and consist-
ing of ohe representative of the fol-
lowing nine schools: College, Engi-
neering, Medical, Law, Pharmacy,
Dental, Mines, Education and Eco-
nomics. This Committee to prepare a.
list of nominations containing at least
one name for each vacancy. The list
of nominations to be published in,THE
WEEKLY at least 60 days before the
annual meeting in June, and each
week thereafter until within 15 days
of annual meeting. Other nominations
may be made by petition of ﬁve or
more alumni, same to be placed in the
hands of the Secretary at least 15
days before the date of the annual
meeting. Names of additional candi-

dates contained in such petitions to]

and to be printed in THE WEEKLY
from week to week as received. Con-
ditions governing methods of adding
names to the ballot by petition to ap-
pear in THE WEEKLY with each list
of nominations published.

The Council to be composed of
ﬁfty members of the General Alumni
Association—32 members at large and
two from each of the nine schools
above mentioned. Council is composed
of two classes, one-half being elected
each year and each class serving for
period of two years.

The Constitution‘ also provides for
the election of not more than ten hon-
orary Vice-Presidents, who graduated
at least 10 years previous to the date
of their nomination, no speciﬁed dut-
ies being assigned to these officers
and they being, as the title implies
merely honorary.

By action of the Board of Trustees,
the Alumni are entitled to a repre-
sentative on that body. The term of
A. R. Hamilton, ’94, who has been this
representative for one year, expires
June 15, 1915, so that the nominations
cover that office also.

All paid up members of the Associ-
ation will receive a ballot, setting
forth all candidates for the various
offices, this to be sent out at least 10

CLASS REUNIONS.

 

We expect to have some interesting
news in the next » issue of THE
WEEKLY regarding class reunions at
commencement time. According to
the official Reunion schedule, the fol-
lowing classes are to meet in June:

1849, 1850, 1851, 1852, 1868, 1869,
1870, 1871,. 1887, 1888, 1889,. 1890,
1906, 1907, 1908, 1910, 1912, and 1914.

We have heard already from a num-
ber of these classes and they will have
reunions. 1910 and 1912 men are
busy and 1914 will be in line sure. The
younger classes should set the pace in
this movement.

L. W. McIntyre, 1912 class presi-
dent, is now working with the General
Secretary and has avcomplete list of
all men of his class. Letters will be
sent out by him in the very near fut-
ure. The 1912’ers are planning a.
banquet and also will erect a class
memorial on the campus during Com-
mencement week. A fund has been
in existence since that class graduat-
ed and now amounts to over $200.00.

We will have a regular Alumni Day
during the Commencement week and
the reunions should be held at that
time. .

Watch THE WEEKLY for full de-
tails. Alumni who belong to classes
which are due for reunions should
write the General Secretary at once
if they do not hear from the “boost-
ers” in their class.

A LETTER FROM PATTONA

 

The Alumni Secretary has received
the following letter from Roger K.

' Patton, Econ. ’13,‘ who is now located

at Savannah, Ga. His address is “care
Y. M. C. A.” The letter is in re-'
sponse to an inquiry from him as to
whether he ever hears of the Univer-
sity in thestate of Georgia. He en-
closed a clipping of an editorial in a
Savannah newspaper relating to the-
paper by Judge E. H. Gary, which Mr.
Seovel read at the Charter Day Ban-
quet. ’

The letter follows:

“Your letter received and I am very
sorry that I have never answered be-
fore this time, but ﬁrst one thing and
then another has retarded me.’

“I /am always glad to hear from
old Pitt and that the friends and
alumni who are back at home are so
much interested in the fellows who
are scattered all -over the country. It
not only does me lots of good to re-
ceive the PITT WEEKLY which ar-
rives every Monday, but also to be
asked questions from people who are

. not from Pennsylvania at all about

our University.‘ I have had a great
many questions asked me especially
about athletics, research, and ‘the
Schools of Mines, Education and Eco-
nomics. Football is giving us a.repvu-
tation all over the southeast. Last
fall, Pitt’s football had the promi-

,, nence of Harvard and Yale in the At-
lanta and Savannah papers.

versity in the Savannah papers. I am

“I am very much pleased to hear of
the rapid strides which our Univer-
sity is making and when I see Pitt
I shall
always be a loyal Pitt booster.”

Sincerely yours,
ROGER K. PATTON, ’13.

 

ESTABROOK IN ‘FAR  CHINA.

.Aluinni will be interested in the fol-
i lowing letter receivedfrom  Esta-
ebrook, Mines ’11, who ‘is.now located
in China. _Hi§, U._.S. address is Platte- ‘

    

ville, Wisconsin, and his China ad-
dress is “Care Standard Oil Company,
of New York, Pekin, China.” '
“My dear Davis:

I have your letter of December 19th
and the campaign for 2,000 members
has my full sympathy for I consider
it. a privilege, as well as a duty, for
_every graduate to belong to the
Alumni Association, that being cer-

J. tainly one of the least things we can

do for our University, and a good start
toward something better. Unfortunate-

H.’ ly there are no Pitt graduates in this

vicinity among whom I may campaign
for members, as Pitt has not had many
Chinese students in _the past. There
are several Chinese graduates of Am-
erican colleges with the parties in the
ﬁeld, most of them being Columbia
men. _ -

As far as I have been able to learn
I am the only Pitt man in China at
present, although there may be some
in Southern China that I have not heard
from. The American college men of
Pekin and Tientsin have a college club
which holds semi-annual banquets,

usually in Pekin, since the greater
number of the men are connected with
the college and missionary work there.
I had the privilege of attending the
November banquet that was held in
Tientsin where a hundred and twenty-
ﬁve men gathered and refreshed them-
selves with the familiar sounds of col-
lege yells and songs. It was one of
the bright spots of my last visit to
civilization. .

My work over here is on geological
exploration of Northern China in
search of oil and gas. It takes me far
into the interior, two to ﬁve hundred
miles from a railroad in a region part-
ly farmed by a poor and primitive peo-
ple and partly wild land, where few
people besides ourselves ever go and
where game of many kinds roves un-
disturbed. Deer are so tame that it
ceases to be sport to shoot them, and
even the leopard I got the other day
permitted me to approach within a
hundred yards. A

The climate is very much like that
of Pittsburgh in temperature but is
very much dryer,Aand we are ﬁnding
it very pleasant and‘ satisfactory to
live in tents during the winter. All of
the Americans out here are enjoying
the best of health and good spirits.

The last I heard from Geo. T. Halde- r

man was when he was working for
the Lehigh Valley Coal Company‘; at
Wilkesbarre, Pa. As far as I know he
is-still with them.

My best wishes to our mutual
friends in Pitt Circles;

Sincerely, .

, E. L. ESTABRO0K.”

.With the letter he enclosed a photo.-
graph of a group of Chinese soldiers-—
cavalry from a Chihli regiment, the
province in which Pekin is located.
Estabrook states they escorted his
party through a bandit infested region
last fall.

“JIM” FLEMING HEARD FROM.

J. R. Fleming, Mines ’11, whom wg
all knew as “Jim,” and who, in’ addi-
tion to many other compliments,
possessed an ever-present smile which
made him hosts of friends, Writes the
Alumni Secretary in an interesting
way of some of the undergraduate
customs at the University of Illinois.

Fleming is located with the Bureau
of Mines at Urbana, Ill., as was noted
in the “PITT WEEKLY” recently.
‘He is investigating coalmining
methods in Illinois, in co-operation
with the University of Illinois and the
State Geographical Society. With the
letter is sent a postal photo showing
the Illinois students ready for the
1914 sack rush. Fleming’: letter,
which among other things describes
this class rush, follows:

Urbana, Ill., Feb. 23, 1-915.
My Dear Davis:

I am receiving the PITT WEEKLY
regularly now, thanks to you. Tried
myself out the other day to see
whether or not I had deteriorated any
on old “Allegenee-gene-gee nae,” and
ﬁnd that I am in good condition. Am
sorry that I am unable to attend the
Big Banquet as such an invitation al-
was hits a responsive chord.

No doubt Pitt has improved in all
departments since I graduated. Not
that I admit that. I was a handicap in
anyway, but I know the forces of Pitt
are developing. _ .

I am not fully posted as to the
changes that have been made at Pitt
in the class scraps, you see that is
one reason I need the PITT WEEKLY,
but as I remember in the “old” days,
not more than six years ago, there
was no fully established custom. Of
course there was plenty of “scrap.”
Get three or, four hundred fellows
piled up together and there is always
a little friendly rivalry. But we all
appreciate that these scraps are
events for “fond recollection” and
should therefore have some distinct
features, in keeping with the Pitt
propaganda. .

The pillow scrap always appealed
to me as a source of great ﬁun. I
have no special suggestions to make,
but want to tell you about the scrap
at the University of Illinois, adopted
in 1913. The same has been in vogue
at Wisconsin for some time, I under-
stand. The enclosed pictures will give
you a good idea of the carryingout
of the scrap.

The football ﬁeld is used and sacks
as shown in picture are placed on the
line ‘in the middle of the ﬁeld. Then
sacks are cigar shaped, made of can-
vas ﬁlled with excelsior, and are eight
feet long, eight inches in diameter at
the ends, ‘twelve inches diameter in
the migidle. Sacks are placed at in-
tervals of ﬁfteen feet across the field

_and opposing sides are lined up.
Sides are then divided into squads, so‘

many for each sack, of course the
freshmen will be in the majority. Each
squad has a captain to direct the work,

» each member of this squad may have

a generous dwub of paint to be dis-
tinguishable to one "another. Students
are required to wear rubber sole shoes.
Classes ~are_then~ lined up ten‘ feet

from the center line. The aim then
is for each class to get the sacks back
over its own goal line, ﬁfty yards
back. This makes a better scrap than
moving the sack, forward over the
other line, a method tried the first
year. Two halves of ﬁfteen or twenty
minutes are allowed. The side getting
the most sacks bver their own goal

lino wins. It is a good all around
scrap, and satisfactory from tho
spcctator’s standpoint. Of course

gencralship counts to a great extent,
but it requires some brawn, and the
sack will move in the direction in
which the greater force is acting. This
is a scrap in which a large student
body can engage. '
Probably I have related something
to‘ you with which you are entirely
familiar. If this is so, then I shall
have to resort to some original idea:
later, .

' Very cordially,

  PROSPECTS 
AHE BRIGHT

Making up for a late start, the
Varsity baseball nine are practicing
hard every afternoon on Trees Stadium
for the opening game with Tech, a
week from ‘today. The men are show-
ing remarkably good form for this

9 ‘ time of the year, and this holds good

promise for the season. The Plaid

A team has been practising indoors for

r

several weeks and are looking well.
Reports from the Schenley Park insti-
tution claim a ﬁne team for the Tech-
nical boys this season. _

There are three candidates for the
catching department. Beatty with his
knowledge of the game, of course
leads, but the others are showing up
strong. Matson, who caught for Shady-
side last year, is showing up well and
should make a good understudy for
Beatty. Austin, substitute catcher of
last year, is also on the job. With
Langdon, Hart, Kennedy, and Riehl
on the job the coaches are not worry-
ing about the ﬂinging department.
Peck is showing his old time form at
ﬁrst and has things all his own way
at that station. Hastings and Gray
are ﬁghting it out for the guardian-
ship of the middle sack with honors
about even. Both are classy perform-
ers and no matter who wins the other
will be carried as utility inﬁelder.
Healy at short and DeHart at third‘
complete the inﬁeld. The present in-
field is full of pepper and keeps things
going all the time. The announcement
has been made that Johnny Hays, last
year’s third baseman, will not be out
this year. The hard work of the med-
ical course keeps him off the diamond
this spring.

In the outﬁeld, Jim Morrow, Engle-
hart, and Dillon’ seem to have the edge
on the other candidates. All these
men are hard hitters and with these
men to back up the inﬁeld things
should roll along smoothly. If Will-
iamson is able to get into the game
this spring, he may be used in the
outer garden, but it is hard to see how
a sick man can beat out any of the
present players.

T.‘-HAMPIUNSHIP GUP
PRESENTED

The time was eleven thirty, on the
morning of Friday, April 9. The place
was Memorial Hall.

 

Captain Norman C. Ochsenhirt, the
doughty, Dutch dribbler, of the past
season's Varsity basketball team, ac-
cepted the championship basketball

‘ cup from the Chancellor and made a

most wonderful memorized extempo-
raneous speech of acceptance. Then,
much to the dissapointment of the
audience, he replaced the cup on its
pedestal and left the stage without
favoring the assembled multitude with
the much-heralded and widely-famous
yodel..The gathering felt, and rightly,
that they had been buncoed.

But the cup was a dandy and what
it represented meant even more to the
student body, for it was the trophy
that was awarded Pitt for the cham-
pionship of the State in basketball.
The students are justly proud of last

»season’s quintet and all look forward

to another championship team next
year. The record made by the ﬁve this
year is one that will be hard to equal,

A ' but the students, and the players are

looking forward to next year with
high hopes. Three times must the cup
be won before it becomes the perman-
ent property of a school. The loss of
Ochsenhirt and Graham will be severe-
ly felt, but with the material from this
year’s Freshmen class and with the
pew material of next fall these holes
should be at least partially ﬁlled.

BLUE AND GOLD
GIRLS WIN AGAIN.

Keeping up the fast gait that they
have been maintaining all season the
Freshman Girls’ sextet downed the
Allegheny High Girls’ team to the
tune of 30 to 13. The game was fast
and exciting throughout. and was
marked by the close guarding of the
college girls’ guards. The Allegheny
forwards were only able to cage four
ﬁeld goals. Wehmeier, playing for-
ward for Pitt, led the ﬁeld with 7
goals from the ﬂoor and 6 out of 13
from the foul line. Vohr followed with
5 ﬁeld goals. : McClenahan and Beck
scored all the points for the high
school girls. The lineup: --

Hart from ﬁelding bunts over on the
ﬁrst base line.

 

Word comes from Perry Graveal,
end on Pitt’s 1911 football team, and
shortstop the following spring that he
has again cinched a job on the Illinois
nine. Graves has made both football
and baseball teams two years in suc-
cession, being popular choice for All-

Mississippi,- which Illinois visited on
its Southern trip.

Bob Peck is the commander-in-chief.
Our ﬁrst baseman will lead a forlorn

‘Reports of Captain Ochsenhirt’s
forensic ability have, evidently become
widespread. The noblest German spoke
before the North Side Y. M. C. A.,
last Monday night, on clean living,
while "Babe” Graham covered the sub-
ject of fair play. We don’t know
whether Pitt’s representatives were on
the program as glorious illustrations
or as horrible examples.

 

“If you really want to help me win

Peck, last Monday, after Bob had

mouth with a wet sponge, “go try that

if they keep on playing basketball?

A certain heavyweight boxer, who
was until recently hailed as a future

the opinion that Jock Sutherland was
about six hundred years late coming
into this lower mundane sphere, and
that, encased in a coat of mail and
topped off by a helmet he would have
made Richard C. Lion, Roland, Charles

BIG AQUATIC MEET
SATURDAY NIGHT.

 

An annual event of unusual interest
will be staged at Trees Gym on Satur-
day evening of this week in the form
of the Interscholastic .?Swimming
Championships of Western Pennsyl-
vania. held under the guardianship of
the University of Pittsburgh.

Teams from all the leading high
schools of the. city and section will
be entered in this event, including the
representative aggregations from
Peabady. Sewickley High, Allegheny,
Shady Side, Ralston, Fifth Avenue
High. and Central. , The strongest
splash squadrons will be placed in ac-
tion by the ﬁrst four contesting insti-
tutions named, that of Shady Side be-
ing especially formidable. The team
from Shady Side will have a marked
advantage over their rivals in the fact
that they number V among their men
Lovejoy and Born, both of the P. A. A.
swimming team, and their‘ individua‘
work should do much to brighten the
prospects of their squad.

The prizes for which the contest
will be waged should be enough in

to their best endeavor. To the hold-
ers of the ﬁrst three places in each
of the events will be given gold, silver
and bronze medals. To the team win-
ning the relay will be presented a
handsome silver loving cup engraved
with the event and the name of the
institution represented.

The remarkable thing about this
epoch-making affair is that it is abso-
lutely free to any one who desires to
attend. This is one of the rare occa-
sions upon which the students of ‘the.
University and the people of the city
are offered something for nothing and
it is foretold very freely met there
will be a record breaking crowd in at-
tendance at the championship meet of
Saturday evening. 1

BASKETBALL
CAPTAINCY

Ben Lubic, star allaround man on
the last. two years’ basketball teams,
was unanimously elected captain of
next year’s ﬁve, at a meeting last
Thursday. He was one of the main-
stays of the championship team this
year and led the teom in the number
of points scored. Lubic is now a ﬁrst-
year law student, having spent one
year in the School of Economics. He
prepped at Braddock High, where he
was the star of the basketball team.

Lubic started the past season at

 

zkuard, and along with Captain Ochsen’.

nirt -made a‘ pair of guards that was
hard to beat. Later in the season he
was moved to a forward position
where he continued his star work. His
floor work is as good as the best, but
it is from the foul line that he par-
ticularly shines. His record of the
past season, of over seven out of ten,
is hard to beat. In one_of the Tech
games he broke all local college rec-
ords when he shot the ball through
twenty straight times. His clean, hard,
conscientious work has made him
well-diked by the student body, and
his election is extremely popular
with the students.

Tonight the Athletic Council will
award the Varsity insignia to the
members of last season’s squad. Those
who are eligible are Captain Ochsen-
hirt, Lubic, Matson, Carlson, Hast-
ings, Graham, Healy, and McCullough.
Of the eight members of this year’s
team only two will be lost for next
year. These are Captain Ochsenhirt
and Graham. As previomsly announc-
ed, S. D. ‘Flinn is the manager‘ for
next year’s team, and he has already
started on his schedule. '

The election of next year’s captain
was held in connection with a dinner

Flint and the members of the Varsity
squad. Coach Flint will entertain the
players at his home, on Thursday
evening of this week.

YET

RELAY TEAM
' TO BE SELECTED.

The track and ﬁeld meets at Phila-
delphia are the really big things of
the track year as far as Pennsylvania
is concerned. They are held under the
auspices of the University of Penn-
sylvania, at Franklin Feld, and the
honor which comes to the winner of
any event there scheduled causes a
double amount of interest in the oc-
currence. ’

Earlier in the year it was thought
that no team would this year be sent
to the Big Glow at-Franklin Feld un-
less something promising appeared in
the line of quarter-mile material.
Some very valuable men have been
discovered by Coach Kerr, and they
are fast developing into the most
promising sort of quarter-milers, so

Pitt to the margin will be handed an
unpleasant surprise unless something
goes wrong with some of the Blue and
Gold speeders.

In the preliminary heats held last
Saturday the showing made by the
men engaged was of the most ﬂatter-
ing character. Running in the first
instalment of the relay, DeHart had
the better of Carlson; in the second
chapter Burwell bested Cook, and
Mays punctuated the conclusion by
ﬁnishing a step ahead of Grumbling.

tion of the team which will represent

Trees Field next Wednesrday and’ the

same place one .week later. The rivalry
outs are likely to assume the aspect
of the most desperately contested
meet. » .

In addition, the University swim-
ming championships will be decided,
with the single exception of the 100
yard event, which has already been
won_by Swope.

MEET ON SATURDAY

ing centered on the athletic meet be-
tween the different departments of the
University, to be held --Saturday, on
Trees Field. This affair has ever been
one of the annual events of the insti-
tution in which an abnormal amount
of rivalry was exhibited. It gives the
students of the various schools of the
Universityan opportunity to give vent
to a strong feeling of competition.

In this athletic meet samples of
everything from a _ relay race to the
swimming contest will be presented,
with the assurance of a great amount
of enthusi sm from those in attend-
snce as we as from the entries them-
selves. The trials for the ﬁeld events
of . this contest will be held Saturday
morning, and on Thursday and Fri-
day afternoons. The task of each
school in picking out the men to repre-
sent them on the ﬁeld ‘ will be an
arduous one. '

‘On Saturday afternoon the ﬁeld and

~ track events will draw all attention.

The big oval is being put in the best
possible condition for the affair, and
the track is sure‘ to be in condition to
warrant more consideration than the
spurning it will receive from the
spiked slippers of the numerous high

steppers.

The evening will see" the crowd in
the Gym attending the aquatic part
of the progra.m. Then all the splash
events from the plunge for distance
to the hard-churned ﬁfty yard -dash
will be enacted over, in conjunction
with the interscholastic contests of
the evening.

TENNIS TEAM TO .
- BE PICKED SOON.

 

Last Saturday the ﬁrst trials for
the Varsity tennis team were held at
the Trafford City Courts. The lack of
local courts ‘is hampering the team,
and is making it hard to get men out.
Only ten or a dozen men were on

go on for several weeks so that a good
line can be secured on the new ma-
terial. The four winners in these
rounds of elimination will meet the
four men‘ of last year’s squad.

This week “June” Wilbert and Wal-
lace Ebe, members of the team of two
years ago, came out for practice and
will try for positions. Both these men
are able wielders of the racquet and
have had much experience on the
courts. Their addition to the squad
should aid the team greatly. An-
nouncement has been made that the
winners of the matches from now on
will receive racquets presented by a
local store. _

Arrangements ‘for local courts are
being made and the chances that Pitt
will have courts of its own this year
are very bright. This will be due to
the students themselves who have
formed the Tennis Association, -and
who propose to have the courts pre-
pared for the opening of the spring
season.

THIS IS THE
WAY IT All
  HAPPENED

If. William Charleston’s ﬁghting
record is ever published, it will show
an item something like this‘: “K. 0.,
3 rounds, "by Jock Sutherland, April
6, 1915.” And William probably thinks
that that is sufficient; but we know
better. It ought to be: “K. 0., 3
rounds, by Jock Sutherland, Bob Peck,
Pat Herron, April 6, 1915.” That's
what Herron says, anyhow, and he
ought to be an authority. A little

slow music while he tells his story:

’ “Jock was entered in the heavy-
weight division in the A. A. U. boxing
tournament, at McKeesport, last
Week,” says Herron. “Just like a regu-
lar boxer, he had to have a manager
and seconds. Bob saw him ﬁrst, so
he got the manager’s job, and I land-
ed as chief second. There were no
assistant seconds. Jock objected to
signing us up, because we wouldn’t
furnish. him with references as to
character and previous experience;
but we compromised by promising‘ to
pay our own carfare. '

“Well, we got‘ into the hall _all right,
each of us carrying one of Jock’s
shoes, so the doorkeeper would know
we were officials. We sat around
while the lighter ﬁghters polished
each other off. Every once in a while
we’d give Jock some advice about how
to ﬁght. Most of the time, though,
we spent in watching the seconds, so
we’d know what to do. Even at that,
I'm afraid our technique wasn’t all it
might have been.

“Finally the time came for the
heavyweight bouts. Only three men
were entered in this division, and Jock
was drawn to ﬁght some fellow from
Duques‘ne, the winner to ﬁght Charles-
ton for the championship of the divi-
sion. The Duquesne entry looked at
Jock’s shoulders, and the length of his
arms, and then went over to speak to
the doctor who was in attendance.
‘Doc,’,he said, ‘don’t you think I’d bet-
ter drop out of this tonight? My
heart. isn’t very good, and I’m afraid
to take chances on it.’ The doctor
gave ‘him the once over, and decided

that his heart was weak, all right.

Besides, the fellow claimed his life
wasn’t insured, and he had a family
depending on him. So that left just
two entries, Jock and this Charles-
ton. ‘

“After the 'x,Duquesne boy"s feet
froze, Bob and I though Jock would
have easy sailing, but we hadn’t
seen Charleston. When he came into
get weighed Bob asked Jock if he
could afford to miss classes for a few
weeks. You see, Charleston wasn’t
so very tall, but he weighed two
thirty, and his arms were like der-
ricks, and his hair was clipped close,
and his upper front teeth had left
him, and taking it all in all, neither
of us envied Sutherland a bit. "

“We marched in on either side of
Jock, and he hopped up into the ring
and the referee took him and
Charleston and gave them a long
talk about the rules. Bob and I did
our best to look digniﬁed, like regu-
lar seconds do, but it was no use. We

were too much excited to play the

The current week will witness the
close of the girls’ basketball season,
the success of which has been equaled
only by the Blue and Gold Varsity. By
Saturday ‘evening the ecords and
achievements of this remarkable Co-‘ed
sextet will have passed into history

they are encountered by the Pitt sex-

contested game is sure to result. The
ﬁnal contest is -with the team from
Margaret Morrison, which holds a
shade the better of the argument be-
tween the different girls’ schools of
the city and section. The Pitt Co-eds
will be handicapped in the fact that
they will be forced to play this game
off their own ﬂoor. Undaunted by this
handicap, they are determined to end
their ﬁrst and exceedingly successful
season with a brace of victories, one
of which they are conﬁdent will be

corner, and the referee_looked over
to see if we were ready. Just then
Jock asked me, ‘How am I going to
get this bloody bothrobe off?’ and it
wasn’t «until then that I found that,_
in the excitement, I'd put ms gloves

to come off. That took more time,
but we ﬁnally got through, and hop-
ped back down on the floor, and the
gong rang for the ﬁght to begin.
“We’d told Jock to stand off as far
as he could and swat Charleston at
long distance, but he’ got warmed up
and forgot all about our advice.
Charleston was too heavy and too

‘didn’t have much chance to yell that
ﬁrst round. Jock came back to his
,corner and sat down on the stool, his
ihead bent over, and puffing like an
lengine. Peck started to sponge and
{rub him, while I grabbed a towel and
Efanned him. It didn’t seem to do
much good, till somebody in the
audience yelled, ‘Stretch him out, lay
his head back.’ I guess my fanning
hadn’t done much but part his hair.

“Then the bell rang again, and
Jock got up. Bob left the stool in
the ring, and the referee howled at
him to take it out. ‘What for,’ Bob
said, ‘what will he do if he wants to
sit during the ﬁght?’- But the ref-
eree made him take it out.

“Jock was cooler this time, and
kept away from Charleston. Two or
three times he landed good punches,
and the crowd got up and whooped
like mad. -Charleston swung back,
but Jock had a stiif guard, and held
him off. The round ended with some
lively swatting. Jock came- over and
sat down again, and this time we
knew how to lay him out. Bob near-
ly queered things, though, when he

sponge which was soaked in cold
water. It nearly laid Svutherland out.

DAVIS.

 

 

The play which will be presented
at the Davis Theater for the week of
April 19 will be “Kindling.” This
play was played for about three
seasons by Margaret Illington, one of
the best known actresses associated
with the stage at the present time.
The play is one of deep human inter-
est, having for its background the
less fortunate though honest and
industrious people who are compelled
to live in houses which are illy suited
for human occupancy, while the owner
reaps a handsome reward from re-
ceiving excessive rents and giving
little, if anything, in return. The play
serves as an object lesson, upon the
theory that one-half of the world
does not know how the other half
lives. There is a romantic story per-
meating the play, which has its be-
ginning with a young physician whose
patients are among the poorer class.

GRAND.
._Q__

At the Grand Opera House begin-
ning next Monday afternoon, April 19,
Mrs. Leslie Carter and her players hold
the position of honor. In the fourth
act of “Zaza,” the emotional actress
promises a dramatic treat. Selecting
her supporting company, Mrs. Carter
had recourse, too, to the group of
players who had been associated with
her in the legitimate, and so she chose
for the role of Bernard Dufrene, Mr.
Hamilton Revelle; for that of Gas
cart, Mr. William Lorenz and for the
maid, Natalie, Miss Dolaro Belasco.
Critical opinion credits Mrs. Carter
with having done a most exceptional
thing for vaudeville and having, in-
deed, added signally to her theatrical
prestige. The Philadelphia “Inquir-
er” declared that she had given even
greater force to the situation than she
did in the longer play.

ALVIN.

 

Marie Dressler, in her clever farce
“A Mix Up” will return to the Alvin,
week of April 19. This is the ﬁrst
play in which Miss Dressler has ap-
peared without music, for, though the
celebrated comedienne has heretofore
been identiﬁed with big musical ex-
travaganzas, she decided this year to
assume a role which is perhaps a
shade more ambitious than anything
she has hitherto undertaken. The
cast will be the same as was seen
during the former engagement and
will include Bert Lytell, Miss Evelyn
Vaughn, Robert Ober, Sarah McVick-
er, Albert Reed, Julia Blanc, Carlyle
Harris, John Doherty and others.
There will be the regular Wednesday
and Saturday matinees.

SHERIDAN.

 

Sheridan Square Theater during the
week beginning Monday afternoon,
April 19, will offer its patrons a group
of vaudeville attractions of the best
class. Players are coming whose acts
have never before been presented at
popular prices. They will range the
whole catalogue of variety. A play-
let depicting life on the East Side of
New York will be offered by a com-
pany of legitimate actors under the
title of “Liz.” It is a story of tense
lruman interest but with a comedy
phase as well, for “Liz” is a typical
Bowery girl with a slang vernacular
that is immensely funny and yet with
a heart that beats responsively to the
tenderest emotions of humanity. The
play is full of color and has at least
one big dramatic moment. Moreover,
it offers a ﬁeld for speculation on the
subject of the influence of environ-
ment. One of the most attractive
musical specialties on the stage is
promised in the act of the Berrans,
who, besides playing the violin and
piano very artistically and singing
sweetly, offer a surprise impersona-
tion. The act is one of the most re-
ﬁned artistry and has headlined the
most important bills in Gotham.
Harry Lester Mason will deliver a
monologue in German dialect. It is
entitled “The Janitor” and humorous-

of the board of the Pennsylvania Col-
lege for Women, and the Sustentation
Committee of Pennsylvania. Late in
1894, he was called to take charge of
First Presbyterian Church of
Omaha, and remained there for three
years, when he became president of
Coe College, Cedar Rapids, Iowa. In
1896, he received the degree of D.D.
from his Alma Mater, and at the Cen-
tennial of the College in 1902, the de-
gree of LL.D. was conferred upon
him. a ~

While he was at the head of Coe
College, Dr. McCormick was very suc-
cessful in developing the resources of
the institution. The growth of the
college under his administration was
so marked that he was singled out and

account of the life of Chancellor
Samuel Black McCormick.)

Samuel Black McCormick, Chancel-
lor of the University of Pittsburgh
since May, 1914, was born at rwin,
Westmoreland county, Pa., on May 6,
1858. After a boyhood spent at his
studies, in the mercantile business,
and as a teacher when seventeen, he
entered Washington and Jefferson Col-
lege in 1877, graduating in the class
of 1880. Later he taught in the Can-
onsburg Academy and in the Wash-
ington and J efferson College, where he
was an assistant in the department of
Greek. While he was still a student
in college, he passed the preliminary
examinations as a student of law, reg-
istering inthe office of his uncle. He
was admitted to the Allegheny county
bar, July, 1882. The next year, Mr.
McCormick removed to Denver, Col.,
where he beganvto practice law with
R. D. Thompson.

While practicing‘ in the West, Mr.
McCormick decided to enter the min-
istry. He returned to Alleghany and
entered the Western Theological Sem-
inary in 1887. In April, 1890, he was
ordained as a minister and installed
as the pastor of the Central Presby-
terian Church, Allegheny. During his
ﬁve ‘years’ pastorate at this church,
Rev. McCormick was a member of the
board of directors of the Seminary, a
member of the Freedman’s Board, and

called to take charge of what was then
the Western University of Pennsyl-
vania. During his regime here, Chan-
cellor McCormick has had the pleasure
of seeing his institution develope from
a small second rate college into one of
the country’s leading educational
centers, and the removal from the
cramped quarters in old Allegheny to
the p_resent location in Oakland, and
an increase from a few hundred to
over three thousand students.
Chancellor McCormick is prominent
along varied lines of activity, being’ a
trustee of the _ Carnegie Foundation
for the Advancement of Teaching; a

‘member of the revision committee of

the Presbyterian Church, 1901-2; a
member of the College and University
Council of Pennsylvania; director of
the Western Thedlogical Seminary;
Extension Society of Pittsburgh; and
president, 1913, of the College Presi-
dents’ Association of Pennsylvania.
Along the lines of social, literary,
and scientific organization, Dr. Mc-
Cormick isa member of. the Duquesne,
University and Athletic Clubs of
Pittsburgh, the University Club of

New York, Phi Gamma Delta, and the ‘

Naval Institute of Social Science. He
is a life member of the American As-
sociation for the Advancement of
Science, and a member of the Sons of
the American Revolution. Chancellor
McCormick takes pleasure in both
golf and motoring.

THE WAY IT ALL HAPPENED.

(Continued from page 3)

“When the third round opened,
Jock had blood in his eye, and he
went after Charleston for fair.
Charleston came in on a rush, and
Jock laid him down with a swingto
the jaw. Charleston got up and
clinched, but Jock broke away and
knocked him down again. The ref-

eree started to count, but Charleston

said,-l‘Oh, you needn’t count. 'I’m go- ”

ing to quit now.’

“Jock didn’t wait for the referee
to ﬁnish counting, but came over and
started taking his gloves off. As
soon as the referee got through,
Charleston got, up and turned a
handspring, to show the crowd he
wasn’t hurt. ‘Then he walked across
to Jock and shook hands with him.
‘I’m glad you won,’ he said, ‘I have
three watches, anyhow? Then Jock
collected his ‘watch, for ﬁrst prize,
and he felt so good he paid our fare
back home.”

THE BENEFITS TO SHIPPERS.

“Do you know that a manufacturer
in Burlington, Iowa, can ship his
goods to New York, load them on a
steamer, and send them around to San
Francisco by way of the Panama
Canal, at a cheaper rate than it would
cost toship directly by rail,” was the
double-barreled information given to
a newspaper man by. anoﬁicial a few
days ago. Yet it is true, and the

illustration serves to illustrate the ad-

vantages of the canal in a clear, un-
derstandable manner.

The old system of using a heated
iron and dirty cloth presses the grime
and. dirt into your garments. Our
sanitary machine steams it all out,
and removes permanently the dirt,
perspiration, odor and grime. See

TUFT’S GLEE CLUB
TO PERFORM HERE.

 

The musical organization which,
more than any other one agency,
helped to popularize that well-konwn

will be seen in Pittsburgh for the ﬁrst
time when the Tuft’s College Glee
and Mandolin Clubs visit ..this cit
April 22. Mr. Bullard is the brother-
in-law of L. R. Lewis, professor of
music and director of the glee club at
Tuft’s, and the Tuft’s club, which was
the ﬁrst to give the song a place on
its program, included it on its reper-
toir for a number of years before the
song attained its present popularity.

The musical clubs representing the
Boston institution of learning have
made a practice of giving concerts
throughout the country since their
foundation in 188.6. This year the
total number of concerts will reach at
least ﬁfty. On the present trip, which
is being taken during the spring va-
cation, performances are given at New
York, Schenectady, Buffalo, Detroit,
and Pittsburgh. About 'thirty men
comprise the “team” on these trips.

The concert which will be given in
Pittsburgh on April 22, at 8:15 p. m.,
will be held at the Unitarian Church,
corner of Morewood and Ellsworth
