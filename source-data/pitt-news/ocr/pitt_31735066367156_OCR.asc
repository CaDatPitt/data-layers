Over one hundred transactions were made by Student

brisk on the ﬁnal three days, Fin—O

lie Coed Years’ by Walter Lord

‘Rather Bland’ Subject

By ALVIN M. RESNIK

“The Good Years from 1900 to the First World War” by
Walter‘Lord (Harper & Brothers, $4.95) is a hearty stew
" in which chunks of historical meat are immersed in a nos-

talgic broth which exudes the ﬂavor of the times.
Chef Lord takes what is basically a tasteless recipe—a
chronological history of human endeavors from 1900 to 1914—

dotes and revealing asides which
give his book body and the auth-
entic old time flavor.

The basic ingredients of any
stew, of course, is the meat. And
for this meat Lord selects nothing
but the juiciest incidents of the

.‘ times: The Boxer Rebellion, Mc-
Kin1ey’s assassination, the San
Francisco Earthquake and Fire,
and Wilson’s nomination. Each
one of these chunks of historical
meat comprises a chapter in the
book.

Lord’s Subjects Live,

“A Good Man’s Death,” the

,chapter describing President Mc-
Kinley’s assassination, typiﬁes

Lord’s detailed use of documen-,

tation to bring his subjects to life.
V In his description of McKinley,
Lord . says: “To s h 0 W that he
meant what he said — and that
he was really the same as every-

one else — the President liked‘

nothing better than to shake
hands. 2

“He never seemed to miss a
of ﬁfty a_minute. The secret was
the McKinley. grip. As the line
approached fromthe left, he seiz-
ed each extended hand . . . gave
xit a quick downward jerk . . .
then a hard pull sideways, send-
‘ g the astonished greeter spin-
ning oﬁ to the right. Everyone
who passed got an automatic
‘Glad to see you’ and an.equally
automatic but magniﬁcent smile.”

For the broth of his stew,
Lord borrows a cup of extrava-
gance from the Astors, a hand-
ful of poverty from the sweat
shops,‘ an apronful of exhuber-
ance’ from the Suﬁragettes, a

-fhatful of daring from Teddy

Roosevelt, and a dash of inven- ‘

tion from the Wright brothers.

Lord’s particular culinary gen-
ius lies in his ability to blend
these warm, human ingredients
with the cold, material ingredients
of history in a way which allows
the human element to predom-

inate, bind the stew, and make it

meaningful.

Campaign Notes . . .

By Rodger D. Yeager and
John C. La Rosa

Richard Nixon’s personality will
certainly be one of the decisive
factors in the November election.
A great many voters, when asked
to comment on Nixon, simply say,
“I don’t like the man.” They are
usuallynot able to qualify their
opinions with speciﬁcs, and they
are never able to justify such

‘ labels as “tricky Dicky.”

‘ 7-

'Republican image—makers, capi-

‘ talizing on the short public mem-

ory, have launched a “humaniz-
ing” campaign to change the free-
wheeling, callous “old” Nixon im-
age into the smoother, experienc-
ed, diplomatic “new” Nixon im-
age. Their standard pitch is sim-
ply that the “old” Nixonwas a
myth which existed only in the
public utterances of ,Democratic

V propaganda mongers. All mycthse

have a basis in factghowcver, and

"’M_r.'Nixon’s is no exception.

The highlight of the campaign

L was a series of anonymous tele-

‘Curiously, Nixon’s 1950 cam-

From the outset, the Democratic

a Philadelphia lawyer. (Among
Chotiner’s other clients were a

 - I -The Facts About Nixon

{Pink Journoiism
The pamphlet itself, an unsign-
ed document printed on pink sic
paper, purported to be an accurate
resume _'of Mrs. Douglas’ voting
record in Congress as compared
with that of a supposedly Com-
munistpaffiliated New York Con-
gressman, Vito Marcantonio.
_ Marcanconio, who disliked Mrs.

Douglas intensely, read the “pink
sheets” and told a friend of Nix-
on’s to “tell Nicky to get on this
thing because it’s a good idea.”
“Nicky” followed Marcantonio’s
advice and 550,000 of the anony-
mous pamphlets were distributed
in California before the election;
Nixon won. ‘

Although the 1952 campaign ca-
tapulted Mr. Nixon into the na-
tional spotlight,‘i't did not altar
his A political strategy. He still.
characterized his opponents as left
to the point of being “pink.”

‘ One particularly interesting
piece of inuendo was his .state-
ment that ‘V‘th_e'onlyiway’t-0 save

ism or Stevensonianism or ‘what-.

Learning» became literally a‘
Tower of Babel.
M Students wandered all about
the building for days ironing out
schedule mistakes, standing in
lines, ‘getting signatures, standing
in lihes, paying fines, standing in
lines, and standing in more lines.
This confusion was focused ‘at
the Oflice of Student Records on
the 18th floor.

The principle causes of this largenumber of
schedule changes were: poor departmental planning
of basic courses,~stude_nt decisions to switch classes,
and‘ administrative errors made in both the Stu-
dent Records Otlice and other offices. And the
reason why things got all snarled up at registra-
tion was because not enough facilities were pro-
vided to handle the thousands of people who want-
ed to make schedule changes.

This disorganization arose from the change in
the registration system. I’m not referring to'the
new mail-in/procedure; that is an excellent im-
provement over the old system of registering in

A Senseless Policy
It’s hard to ﬁnd any rationale behind the Uni-

versity’s decision to discourage class changing.

No More Changes _

The mess on the 18th ﬂoor was the result of a
new policy made, as far as I can understand, by
the Director of the Office of Student Records, Mr.
Hodges, the Dean of the School of Liberal Arts,
Dr. Martin, and a couple of other deans. These
administrators came to the conclusion that it is

needed.
ﬁll them‘?

dents to change their schedules, evenbefore classes
begin. .

To enforce this policy, the Director of O.S.R.
decided to throw out the previous system. Under
the old system the O.S.R. adjusted schedules in
the Commons Room where adequate space, desks,
and personnel were provided to process a large
number of people quickly. Now, all schedule
changes had to be made by a couple of people up
in the O.S.R. ‘ 4

When asked why schedule adjustments were no
longer being made in’ the "Commons Room, the
Director gave an interesting answer. He said that

.. if they were, everybody and his grandma would
have wandered in to mill about and change their
schedules just for the thrill ' of it. Schedule-
oswitching, I am sure, certainly gives some sort of
stimulation to Mr. Hodges. .But it‘ doesn't, the
students. ' "

"Changes Are Necessary" .
The Director said that most of the changes"

Room. He said, .. further, .that those changes» which '

While many people spend long hours trying to get one
job, the staff of University Placement Service must find sev-
eral hundred every year.

Located on the second floor of the Schenley Hall, the
Placement Service aids graduating seniors and alumni in
locating employment.

Dr. Walter Ritenour, dir‘ector,¢
urges students graduating in De-a
cember to register as soon as pos-
sible. Commenting on the employ-
situation for the coming
year, Ritenour said, “In all prob-
ability, opportunities for technical

Grid Experts Pick Cats

High Despite Schedule

By JACK SMITH

The Panther football team appears to have the material;
if they’re hungry, “watch out,” this could be the year.

The Blue and Gold have been given a fourth place pre-
season rating by grid experts. Evidently feeling is running
high that the Panther are due for a big year despite their

usually heavy schedule.

With only one week of prac-
tice remaining Coach John Mich-
elosen’s forces are beginning to
perform like a smooth working
machine. The second team had
been lagging behind the first unit
but the gap in development is
beginning to disappear.

Best In County

' There is no question about the
material in the backﬁeld. Toward
9-the end of last season the Pan-
ther backﬁeld, the C-Boys, came
along to pick up 70% of the team’s
yardage.

' Halfbacks Bob Clemens, Fred
Cox and Fullback Jim Cunning-
ham comprise what could be
the best backﬁeld combination
in the country.

Dave Kraus seems to be in the
driver’s seat. Kraus, along with
Ed Shrockman and Jim Traﬁcant
will handle the quarterback
chores. Traﬁcant, a sophomore, is
the Paﬁther’s best passer. In re-
cent ~.scrimmages he has been
threading the needle, hitting as
high as 10 of 11 passes.

Along with Reinhold is John
Yaccino. As a sophomore he
showed promise. Yaccino has
tacked on a little Weight but
still possesses an’ abundance of
speed.

One back who seems to get
overlooked when talent is being
rated is Ray Tarasi. Tarasi is one
of the best in the Panther’s sec-
ondary.

Both Andy Kasic and Mike
Frasca might see some action.
Kasic is a little speed merchant

ther cross-country team for;

Coach Carl Rees has only)

two years, and already his}
of i
achieving an impressive rec-i

cord. His third team appears set‘
to compete with a high degree of
excellence in the coming season.

Rees is banking on the sopho-
mores to blaze the trails of the
course woods and come home with
a good share of victories. The 1960
edition of Panther harriers cover-
ed a three-quarter mile run over
the Schenley Park Golf Course
on Thursday in a better time than
was recorded all last season.

Rees is quite satisﬁed with his
charges and calls them the best
conditioned crew that the’ school
has had in a long time: “Without
a doubt,” he remarked, -“we are
much stronger than last year.”

Rees was born in Yonkers,
New York, where he completed
high school in three years. Be-
tween high school and college,
he spent three years in the Navy
as an aerial gunner and bom-
bardier. Most of his tour of duty
was spent on the North and
South Atlantic.

Coach Rees has a good back-
ground in track, enabling him to
pass along valuable information
to his charges. He has participated
in the shot put, hammer throw,
discus, and javelin events. He
graduated from Springfield Col-
lege in 1950, receiving a BS. in
Physical Education, along with
four letters in football and track,

team is showing signs

In 1947, he was the Eastern

 

intercollegiate javelin champ,
and in 1949, he won the Easte-
ern hammer throw title. In 1950,
he lost the Penn‘ Relays title in

the hammer throw by a few
inches.
After graduation, Rees spent

two years at Johns Hopkins as
football line coach and head coach
in wrestling, track and cross-
country. At Columbia University
the next twd years he was as-
sistant track and cross-country
coach. After coming here in Sep-
tember, 1955, Rees was assistant
track coach until 1958.

Three years ago a pot belly freshman decided he wanted to go
out for the frosh cross—country team. His credentials were three

years of unsuccessful mile running for a local high school and a one .

year lay off during which time he acquired the pot belly.

After two days of practice he was informed that he would make.
the trip to Annapolis on Saturday because several of the frosh run-
ners had been taken ill with the virus and would not be able to
compete.

That weekend he found himself at the hallowed halls of Annapolis
where he was served steak and eggs for breakfast, a tasty turkey
meal for dinner and he was extended many other courtesies that he
enjoyed. . .
As for the meet, well, our pot belly youngster came in 17th.

Now this may not seemed to be much of an accomplishment to

many, but considering that there were 18 runners in the race,

both the coaches and our hero were elated.

Dreams of a great running career began forming in our fresh-
man’s head and for the rest of the year he could be found on the

cinder path furthering his skills.

No we are not talking about Arnie Sowell, Ron Delaney or Herb
Elliot. As a matter of fact our hero didn’t even make the varsity; he
was sidelined by other school interests. But he did get his freshman
sweater ‘and was offered a chance for a scholarship, ifhe had stuck it
out.

The above example is not a meaningless story. There are
several thousand boys entering the University this year as fresh-
man. Out of these frightened frosh there is without a doubt
many who are athletically inclined. .

If presented the opportunity some of these freshman lads could
go out for a sport, make the team, and someday earn their varsity
letters. .

Frank Carver, Athletic Director, is anxious to get as many of
the non—scholarship athletes out for sports as possible. “Last year
we lost track meets because we didn‘t have enough men in the events,”
Carver stated.

“We need mo-re athletes on both our freshman and varsity
teams. Many of the students are under the impression that if he
doesn’t have a scholarship‘ the coaches will not even look at
him,” Carver continued, “But this is not true.” A

“We have never out a. man off the squad in any sport except

freshman basketball.”
” hilt/Ir. Carver’s statements can be backed up by these Dointsiﬁhe
varsity and frosh soccer teams are non-scholarship; there are only
36 freshmen that have scholarships on the frosh football team; a
new varsity riﬂe team has been started; there are also positions open
on the gym, wrestling, swimming and other athletic teams.

The Panthers will need men to ﬁll the spots on these teams, and
Mr. Carver emphasizes, “Everyone is welcome, we have the facilities
and we would like to have the students take advantage of them.”

’Last year is a good example of how the non-scholarship
student can make a name for himself at Pitt. Bill Lindner; co-

_captain of the football team, did not have a scholarship when he

came here. He went out for the football ‘team and made it. By

his senior year he was elected co-captain and now has a success-3
ful job with a large business firm in the area.

Bill Mauro, who sparked the Cats’ basketball team last year, is
another example of a non—scholarship boy making good. When Bill
ﬁnally did get his scholarship he was playing behind All-American
Don Hermon. But Bill stuck it out and last year he was elected co-
captain and voted most valuable player by his teammates. .

Indeed these two are the exception and not the rule. But
neither was an outstanding athlete with All-American potential,
they were just good‘ath\letes with average skills.

“We are still looking for the Lindners, Mauros and Chadwicks,
but we can’t ﬁnd them unless they come out for a sport,” Carver
related. ‘

“I believe that there are at least 20 non—scholarship boys in the
freshman class right now who can win a varsity letter.  also believe
that going out for a sport builds character. When a person plays as
part of a team he gets more out of school by depending on, and being
depended on by his teammates. He also will make many lifelong
friends from his association in sports,” Carver concluded.

‘ So there you have it. A personal invitation from the head of

the athletic department to come out for a sport. I can’t think of a

better reference to put to a coach than, “Mr. Carver told me to

-report.”

In conclusion I know you are dying to know who our cross-
country hero is. Well he is still around the University. His belly is-
a little bigger and he is now pounding a typewriter instead Of 3

After seeing the squad in

“It looks like we have more
depth this year than in previ-
ous years.

“This is a young team with only
seven seniors, but it appears that
the sophomores. can be good var-

some rugged opponents.

Coach Lou “Bimbo” Cec-

coni’s fine group of freshman
football players are running

through their drills every day :

at Tree's Field.

Cecconi is not mwithout
problems however, as the ma-
jority of the squad are backs.
Many have made the transition to
the line and the coaches seem
elated over their tremendous
progress. »

Two scrimmages in the past
week have helped the coaches
choose the line—ups. The second

team has the ability to move into
the limelight, Cecconi reported.
Leading fullbacks are Rick
Leeson, Ray Pop and Chuck Al-
horn, although one may be

switched due to weaknesses.
Paul Martha. and Phil Pulsi-
nelli have the inside track on
the quarterback slot.

“The ends seem to be the best
j_at their positions because of the
similarity ‘of pass patterns in high
school and college. The backs on
the other hand have ‘had to learn
new techniques and formations,”
Cecconi/_said.

He is trying to put the boys at
positions that will be best for
themselves and the team. Right
now there is a deﬁnite weakness
in the line, but with the first game
a week’ away, there should ‘be
enough time to settle most of the
team’s problems.
