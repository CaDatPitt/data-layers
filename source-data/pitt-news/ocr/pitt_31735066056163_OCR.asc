Remarks by BAS political action
Chair spark student concerns

By Jenna Ferrara
The Pitt News

Black Action Society political action Chair
Oscar Eybers’ comments about Jewish and gay
“predominance” on The Pitt News’ editorial
board have provoked outciy as well as invita-
tions to dialogue by the campus Jewish and
gay communities.

Students said they were offended by other
statements Eybers has made, such as,
“Homosexuality is evil,” and, “If you ask many
African people, a lot of people point to the
Jewish community as one of our greatest ene-
mies.” _

In The Blade Panther, a BAS Political Action
Committee publication, Eybers said The Pitt
News is “failing” to. represent its black con-

stituency, in part because the paper “appears to_

be predominantly staffed by Jewish and gay,
lesbian and bisexual individuals.”

In a later conversation, Eybers said, “Jews
have always had rights, always  In fact even if

Eperjesi is not alone among

When asked why he believes the editorial
board to be dominated by Jews, Eybers
responded, “I’d rather just leave it at that.”

B’nai B’ritliHillel Associate Director Cindy
Goodman—Leib said, “Hillel, as a Jewish cam-
pus group, is and has always been open to

communication with the Black Action Society.” -

Goodman—Leib also extended an invitation to
dialogue. “Especially in light of the BAS
Political Action Committee’s recent statements,”
she said, “the campus Jewish community wel-
comes the opportunity to meet and engage in
efforts to improve intergroup relations and
increase the visibility of all ethnic, cultural and
religious groups on campus.”

Pitt News fails black
students, says BAS

By Jenna Ferrara
The Pitt News

The Pitt News is “failing” because there are no black students on
its editorial board,» “which appears to be predominantly staffed by
Jewish and gay/lesbian/bisexual individuals,” according to an arti-
cle by Black Action Society Political Action Chair Oscar Eybers in
the BAS newsletter The Black Panther.

“The editorial board is not representative,” BAS Chair Keith Davis
said. “I amgblack. I come from an African-American perspective.
It’s clear and straightforward. We are not being represented.”

“Simply because we don’t have black editors doesn’t mean we
don’t have African-American staff writers,” said The Pitt News edi-
tor in chief Julie Sabol. “I didn’t choose the editors on the basis of
their color.” -

Black students cannot be represented by an editorial board with-

Jew, you’re coming from a different perspective,” Davis" said.

Over the summer, CWO
asked Director of Student

thing more than a cubicle on
the fifth floor of _the William

Cavalla said he and union
manager Chris Chergi

‘‘I think they want to put the

by putting us both in a cor-
ner,” CWO co—President Shira
Hassan said in June.

But Cavalla said taking one
of BiGALA’s offices was the
only option and the adminis-
tration was not trying to hurt
either group in any way.

Layos said that although the
situation was not ideal,

Edward Stricker, founding
chair of the department of
behavioral neuroscience, loves
the “variety” of his work: “I_ have
three jobs and I wouldn’t want
to give up any of them. I teach, I
have a lab  I design experi-
ments  and I’m the chair of the
department. These are the main
three things that I do. I enjoy
doing all of them. They each
give mea great deal of satisfac-
tion. I like having a mixture of

0 things to do,” he said.

Stricker grew up in the pro-

_jects of the Bronx, N.Y. He left

the Bronx at 16 for the
University of Chicago, and he
said he was “a bit afraid. The 22
hours on the train from New
York to Chicago  were the
hard part. I’d never been more
west than New Jersey. Once I
got there, it was no problem.”
He completed bachelor’s and
master’s degrees at the
University of Chicago in chem-
istry before attending Yale

<University for_his doctorate in

psychology.

“When I was an undergradu-
ate, I had a very strong idea
about what I liked and didn’t
like. I was conscious when I was
an undergraduate of what I
would have done differently as a
teacher. There were things I
loved about particular teachers
and I thought, ‘That’s exactly the
way it should be,’ and there
were others that made me think,
‘That’s exactly what you
shouldn’t do.’ It’s not a surprise
that 15 years later, when I was
teaching, that I knew exactly
what I thought was appropri-
ate,” Stricker said.

Stricker’s ideas about what is
appropriate are exemplified by
his Chancellor’s Distinguished
Teaching Award, which he
received from Pitt in 1992. His
skill and interest in teaching is
evident in his pedagogy.

“There are general things that
I want students to learn. I want
them to learn how to learn. The
facts are simply examples of
how someone goes about learn-

Late Tnigbt
wars keep
students’
eyes open

By Steve Kozarovich
Staff Writer‘

1 Dave. Chevy. _Conan. jay.
' Arsenio. Who are these people?

They are the people hoping stu-
dents will tune into their shows
when it gets late, and when stu-

dents get sick of staring at their '

chemistry textbooks.

The battle for late night has
finally begun, and it looks to be
a pretty good season for insom-
niacs and college students
across the country. ‘

For years Johnny Carson’s .

“The Tonight Show” on NBC
dominated the airwaves. When
he retired a year ago, he turned
the reigns over to formerfill-in
host Jay Leno. At Pitt, Leno has
received mixed reviews from
late night faithfuls. -

“I don’t like Jay because he
tries to act like he’s best friends
with everyone,” first-year stu-
dent Greta Dietrich said. “I like
Dave.” -

In some ways, Carson’s popu-
larity has also helped Leno. The
show has remained popular
among students due to their
familiarity‘. with the show.

“I grew up on ‘The Tonight
Show.’ It’_s sort of a tradition.
‘The Tonight Show’ is late night
television to me,” Pitt student
Kristen Sukolac. said. .

Leno’s toughest challenge is
expected to be the man who
made his mark following “The
Tonight Show,” David
Letterman. After Leno was
selected for “The Tonight Show”

job, Letterman signed a deal

with rival network CBS to host a
show opposite of Jay’s. The deal
will reportedly pay Letterman
about $14 million a year.

Letterman has developed a
large following of Pitt students
withhis self—described “wacky”
brand of humor.

“I’ll watch Letterman wherev-
er he goes; His top—10 lists and
viewer mail are the best,” ﬁrst-
year student Shannon Wright

said.

Financial aid assistance available in many forms

By Jack Finn

Asst. News Editor

Part of the process of seeking help in
paying for a college education is figuring
out the alphabet soup of student loans,
grants and scholarships. And this year
many of the familiar names and letters
have changed.

Of the approximately 12,000 under-
graduates at the University of Pittsburgh,
10,000 receive some sort of financial
assistance, according to executive associ-
ate director of Admissions and Financial
Aid Kevin Altomari.

The assistance may be in the form of
Pell Grants, Stafford Loans, SLS Loans or
Plus Loans through the federal govern-
ment. They may be Pennsylvania Higher
Education Assistance Agency loans sup-
ported by the state.

They may be grants or scholarships
from private foundations or even the uni-
versity itself. A '

“Forty to $50 million in financial aid
passes through this office each year,”
Altomari said. “Some is money we direct-
ly control and some isn’t.”

“The application process [for ﬁnancial

aid] was difficult for me. I would have
appreciated help from the school,” CAS
senior Patty Pologruto said.

“I really learned from my mistakes. I
wasted a lot of time because_I didn’t
know what to do.”

The frustration of figuring out which
types of aid should be applied for, how
to fill out the forms and what the guide-
lines and deadlines are can be reduced
by any of the 15 admissions and financial
aid counsellors at Bruce Hall, according
to Altomari. L

“Dealing with financial aid advisors at
Pitt has been a very positive experience
for me,” ’ CGS senior Rebecca
Bergstressen said. “They are very under-

standing and are concerned about getting '

you the financial assistance that you
deserve.”

The counsellors can take a student step
by step through the process, outlining
the requirements of each typeof assis-
tance. They also must stay current with
the continuing changes in the various
programs. For example, the Higher
Education Amendments of 1992 changed
many of the loan limits, capped interest
rates and changed the basis for need

analysis. -

_“The government estimates that 85 per-
cent of your adjusted gross income is
applicable to financing educational
needs,” Altomari said.

But most people have other needs
such as housing, transportation and food
to think about as well as their higher
education, he added. .

“The well of funds available for stu-
dents isn’t bottomless either. The difficul-
ty we have is limited funds,” Altomari
said.

“The ﬁnancial aid that this office hands
out to students, whether its the federal
campus—based funds or the universities’
hard dollars, is like anybody’s check-
book. -

"When you get to zero you’re at ‘zero,
and there isn’t a whole lot you can do.
Many times we sit down with families
knowing there is a need, but we simply
have no more money.”

The financial‘ aid counsellors must go
through each line item on all statements
submitted by students and their families.
If a mistake, even a small discrepancy
appears, it can void the process or at

Brody said, “I’m pretty shocked. I
wouldn’t have expected that from Oscar
or from BAS  to condone that.

“I’d have to disagree with him as an
African, born in Africa of mixed race,

part Jewish,” Brody said. “These kind of '

words  are meant to incite anger, fear
and misunderstanding.”

Brody said Jews have historically sup-
ported the civil rights movement. “If you
are oppressed and you want a friend,
you can’t go about it by slapping a friend
in the face." .

‘Anti—Semitism in the black community
stems from “losing track of the group
effort to gain the common good,” said
Brody. _ '

Campus \X/'omen’s Organization co-

President Shira Hassan said that as a
Jewish student she was “repulsed, threat-
ened and frightened” by Eybers’ com-
ments. ’

Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs
William Harmon said concerned students
are welcome to discuss the matter with
the Office of Student Affairs.“I’m not
quite sure what we could do, other than
make a statement that we don’t support
those views,” he said. “I don’t share his
views, nor would I support any state-
ments whatsoever in that regard  [but]
he has a right to make those statements.
It’s unfortunate. I wish he hadn’t.”

Eybers also said he is “against homo-
sexuality  I feel as if black people can’t
afford to engage in such activity.”

He said African-American gays, les-

bians and bisexuals are welcome in BAS
“as long as they don’t try to force that
evil behavior on our people.”

BAS Chair Keith Davis and BAS Vice
Chair Michael Barge declined comment.

“Homophobia from the African-
American community hurts me more
than from white people,” said BiGALA
member Brian Broome. “There’s an extra
sense of rejection, an extra hurt when
you’re told you’re evil It’s like being
pushed out of your family  You would
expect [discrimination] from those you
don’t have a kinship with.”

Afrocentrism often involves homopho-
bia and the philosophy that homosexual-
ity is a disease of the white man, Broome
said. “A lot of young black people find it
hard to be pro-black without being anti-

white  To find true pride is when
you’re accepting of yourself without
being anti-someone else,” he said.

Eybers’ statements alienate a “valuable
and intelligent segment of the African-
American population,” said BiGALA co-
President Sacha Layos. “You. aren’t black
or gay  you can be both,” she said.
“Why does [he] assume gay, lesbian and
bisexual issues aren’t black issues? Issues
aren’t that clear-cut.”

“[Eybersl has no right to judge me or
any African-American gay, lesbian or
bisexual and say that what'I do in the
privacy of my bedroom or anyplace else
is evil,” Layos said.

BiGALA business manager Todd
Kinavey questioned Eybers’ tactic of
“taking potshots at other people.”

least delay it until the reporting

is corrected by the student.

This often makes a six to
eight week process drag on for
months longer, according to
Altomari. His suggestions for
easing the tedious process are:

-Meet deadlines, whether
institutional or program dictat-
ed. _

For example, the PHEAA
deadline is May 1, Pitt ﬁnancial
aid deadlines are generally
March 1 for incoming first-year
students and April 1 for upper-
class students.

-Talk to the financial coun-
sellors at the institution where
you are enrolling. Each institu-
tion may have different forms
to fill out.

°Check resources outside of
school such. as your parents’
company-sponsored scholar-
ships, civic group suppon and
“The Scholarship Book” which
lists academic opportunities.

News staff,” Sabol said.
“Honestly, it does not really
matter to me. I want this to be a
comfortable atmosphere for
everyone. Honestly, I’m quite
offended by the fact that he
states ‘predominantly Jewish,
gay, lesbian and bisexual?”

The white-run media in gen-
eral is being disregarded by the
African-American community,
Eybers said.

“The problem that The Pitt
News is having is the problem

that all white media is having A

now,” Eybers said. “A lot of
people are turning off the white
media. Alot of people realize
the lies and the propaganda that
is going through the white
media.”

The BAS is no longer relying
on The Pitt News as a news
source, according to Eybers.

“I think that if we, the BAS,
see all the things improve that
we pointed out before, then I
think our relationship will
improve, but until then we’re
not relying on The Pitt News at
all,” he said.

Other students questioned the

paper’s coverage of African-
American interests.

President Jacob Brody said he’s
heard complaints from both
black and white stud.ents that

African—American concerns dur-
ing Black Week in November.

“That should be changed,”
Brody said. “Students ask, ‘If
[events] are" happening every
day for 12 months out of the
year,  why do I only read
about this now?”’ he said. “What
about thelrest of the year? Are
they cutting the year up into
pieces?”

The Pitt News is quick to pub-
lish negative articles about
crime in the African—American
community but does few arti-
cles on positive themes, such as
top African—American students,
said Sydney Lewis, a member of
the Caribbean and Latin
American Students Association.

“Hey, how about a pat .on the

‘back and some recognition?”

asked Lewis, a junior black
studies and Spanish major with
almost a perfect 4.0 QPA.

Vice Chancellor for Student
Activities William Harmon said,

“I get comments all the time
about The Pitt News regarding
articles and representation  I
think The Pitt News, to the
extent possible, ha_s done a
good job.” Harmon responded
to student allegations that the
paper is not adequately repre-
senting African—American stu-
dents.

“If that’s true, then I think it’s
something that needs to be
reviewed,” he said.

Harmon said he willbring it
to the attention of the Student
Publications Board at the next
meeting.

According to Lewis, The Pitt
News’ recruitment techniques
are ineffective.

“I don’t know where they’re
trying to recruit,” she said.
“After they misrepresent us and
we complain, they say, ‘Well,
why don’t you join?’

“I really like Dave. His style of
comedy is much funnier than
Jay’s,” senior Bob McNabb said.
“I like his sarcasm.”

Replacing Letterman in NBC’s
12:30 a.m. slot will be Conan
O’Brien. After comedians Garry
Shandling and Dana Carvey
both turned down NBC’s offers
to succeed Letterman, the 30-
year—old unknown O’Brien
grabbed the job. O’Brien has
worked as a writer for “The
Simpsons” and “Saturday Night
Live.” H

“I will probably watch Conan
at first just to see what he does,”

.junior Michelle Lee said. “I

know the others but I don’t
know him, so it could be

refreshing.”

Others hosting late night talk
shows this season are Chevy
Chase, Rush Limbaugh and
Arsenio Hall.

Limbaugh’s political, conserv-
ative—based show is both adored
and loathed.“Rush is misunder~
stood. Everyone thinks he’s a
jerk but he cares about this
country,” senior Mike Flanagan
said. .

“His attitude and views
repulsed me. I watched ‘his
show one day, and I swearwl
wanted to kill him,” Dietrich
said.

“The Arsenio Hall Show” has
grown from a failed Joan Rivers’
talk show to a parade of super-
stars like Eddie Murphy,

‘Madonna and Tom Cruise. But

now Arsenio will be competing
to stay on Fox, since Fox is now
promoting its new talk show,
“The Chevy Chase Show.”

Chase’s familiar face has
drawn interest from many Pitt
students.“I think Chevy Chase
will be pretty funny. I like his
style of comedy,” junior Michele
Mulhall said. “He was really
funny on “Saturday Night Live”
and in most of his movies, and I
think that will carry over to his
show.”

Chase is trying not to become
a member of the failed-talk-
show_-host list which includes
such notables as Whoopi
Goldberg, Dennis Miller and Pat
Sajak.

do professionally is solve prob-
lems, and what I. do as a teacher
is talk about phenomenon and

"ask people how they try to

understand it. Learning how to
think clearly and how to use
data, to make data-based deci-
sions, ‘there’s a way of describ-
ing that so as soon as you get a
hold of it, you can generalize
and use it to solve all sorts of
problems.“iIf you want to know
what scientists do, you shouldn’t
read science fiction; you should
read detective stories. That’s
what scientists do. They figure
things out. First they have to
determine if something is a clue.
That’s what I want to do in a
classroom. I eliminate more of
the dead ends, of course. People
may forget the facts, but they
won’t forget the process,” he
said.

Stricker said one of the most
exciting things about neuro-
science is that a lot of the most
fundamental questions haven’t
been addressed yet so it’s possi-
ble to make signiﬁcant advances
on your own.

“In chemistry, all that great
stuff was clone 200 years ago,”
Stricker said.

“Although it’s nice to make

additions now, they’re not core
additions. What people do in the
lab is not going to end up in an
introductory chemistry course.
But what people are doing in
neuroscience ends up in the
introductory course, and that’s
very, very exciting. Twenty years
later, it’s still possible to get in
on the ground ﬂoor.”

Stricker’s interest in teaching
also extends to his job as the
department chair particularly
when hiring decisions are
made.“We have a first-rate facul-
ty in terms of their research, but
they are also wonderful teach-

ers,” he said. “This is a new

department. It didn’t exist six
years ago. We’ve hired 17 peo-
ple in six years. Do I worry
about teaching? Sure.”

The issue of hiring minorities
and women faculty members is
also important during the
recruitment process.

“The Society for Neuroscience
has 20,000 people, and if you
want to ask how many black
people, the answer is less than
200. If you want to hire a black
person in the department, it’s
very hard to find one. The very
academically successful minority
students go to medical school to
become physicians because it’s

he told BiGALA that he would
help find space or conference
rooms if needed. “Right now
space is tight,” Cavalla said. “It
does not seem like anyone _is
leaving floors one through
seven.”

Currently, the eighth and
ninth floors in the Union are
used for other university groups
not student activities.

He said that when new space
opens on campus through
Operation Jump Start, these
floors will be returned to the
William Pitt Union for student
groups.

“Nobody’s kicking people
out,” he said. “It’s if and when
they’re given back to the
William Pitt Union.”

Cavalla said that both groups
now seem to be “in their own
little worlds.”

Layos said that she hopes the

two groups will meet to discuss
future plans for the year.

CWO co—President Bianca
Stonersaid she is also looking
forward to the upcoming" year
and that she has ideas of what
events. CWO wants to sponsor,
but hasn’t yet decided with
which group to ask to co-spon-
sor.

“We’re really glad the waiting

finally hav.e a place of our
own.” I

The new office is good, but
CWO still will look to expand in
the future, while remembering
the troubles it has already been
through, she said.

In the past, CWO and BiGALA
have co-sponsored events. Last
spring they co-sponsored a safe
sex seminar.

Stoner said CWO members
are currently waiting for the
locks to be changed on the
office so they can officially

The Black Action Society has repeatedly claimed to
support the entire black community and has stressed
unity among African Americans.

Last week, BAS political action Chair Oscar Eybers
called Jews an enemyto blacks and said that homosex-
ual behavior ‘was evil.

“Jews have always had rights, always. If you ask many
African people, a lot of people point to the Jewish com-
munity as one of our greatest enemies,” said Eybers. He
also said that he was “against'homosexuality.”

Perhaps Eybers fails to realize that a person can simul-
taneously be Jewish and black or gay and black. Not to

’ mention the possibility of someone being all three. Or

maybe he does realize this, but doesn’t want to consider
such a person a member of the black community.

Last March during the BAS inauguration ceremony,
BAS Chairperson Keith Davis and Deputy Chairperson
Michael Barge both took oaths saying that they would
_“uphold and continue the struggle of the black commu-
nity here at the university.” .

Davis and Barge both refused ‘to comment on Eybers’
remarks. But as the leaders of a very active organiza-
tion, they need to decide on what they believe defines
the “black community.”

If this group is to include all blacks regardless of race,
religion or sexual orientation, then they should say
something and in fact owe the people they claim to rep-
resent an explanation. "

Student Government Board President Jacob Brody
was shocked by Eybers’ comments. He said, “I’d have
to disagree with him as an African, born in Africa of
mixed race, part Je_wish.” I

Brody also said that oppressed groups should work V

together. “Everybody’s now into their own efforts and
has lost track of the group effort to gain the common

Eybers did say that gays, lesbians and bisexuals are
welcome to join BAS “as long as they don’t try to force
that evil behavior on our people.” But this can surely
never be considered a welcome. ‘

“Homophobia from the African-American community
hurts me more than from white people,” said Brian
Broome, a member of BiGALA. “It’s like being pushed
out of your family.” i . .

While Eybers is only one member of BAS, he. is an
active leader of the organization. If the other BAS lead-
ers refuse to address his comments, then we can only
assume that they do not disagree with them.

B’nai B’rith Hillel associate director Cindy Goodman-
Leib welcomes discussion to improve intergroup rela-
tions, and BAS ‘needs to decide whether they would,
E00.

Members of BAS deserve to know whether the BAS
definition of the black community is an exclusive one
and whether or not they are truly being _represented.

Guns too easily reach adolescents  

The relative ease with which guns are procured

‘by adolescents is upsetting. Recently, a World
News Tonight undercover television crew was

able to purchase an alarmingly high number of
semiautomatic weapons without any form of
identiﬁcation at a gun sale held in a warehouse.

Horror stories fill print and television media
with the gut-wrenching aftermath of gang war-
fare, the L.A. riots and domestic

Despite the obvious link between guns and
violence, little progress has been made concern-
ing the control of guns. This is due in great part
to the efforts of the National Rifleman’s
Association; According to the NRA, contributions
to its political-action committees and to cam-
paigns for members of Congress totalled 5.9 mil-
lion dollars in 1988.

The NRA’s political-action com-

violence all made possible by
guns. The glamour of these phal-

mittees are undoubtedly among
the most powerful in the nation. It

lic symbols fades quickly when R055 is little wonder that the Brady Bill,
one considers funeral caskets which, advocates national gun-
filled with dead teenagers, dead P35qU31€‘ control measures, has yet to be

senior citizens, dead 25-year-olds
and dead 11—year—olds. Survivors
have the inspirational options of daily life rituals
which include wheelchairs and colostomy bags.

The rise of gang violence is staggering. Social
scientists studied groups of teenagers who
encourage their peers to commit crimes in order
to be’ initiated into a gang. Newsweele (August 2,
1993) reported that 1,600 guns were used in 1991
by juveniles under the age of 18 to commit homi-
cide. In Reseda, Calif., a 17-year-old male was
gunned down in the hallway of his high school
for giving another teenager a  look.”

Guns end lives and-guns are as relatively acces-
sible as a driver’s license. '

The primary difference between cars and guns
is that the use of cars is more regulated. Car
insurance, having a driver’s license and the high
price of cars are factors regulating when and how
often the public can buy cars. In comparison, the
time and hassle needed to buy guns pales. .

passed by a Congress with mem-
bers under the heavy influence of
the NRA. ,

It is important, then, for those who believe in
gun control, who believe that misguided youth
and dangerous adults have taken the lives of too
many of the innocent, to address this issue by
writing and calling their senators and con-
gresspersons. ¢ J a

Hospital emergency rooms across the countiy
are filled every day with the victims of violent
crime aided by guns. Many more will die until the
American public does everything in its power to
counter the inﬂuence of the NRA and find more
effective ways to control the sale and rampant
use of guns.

Violence in the streets will manifest itself as
bullet wounds just as the NRA manifests itself in
Congress as long as not enough is done to
enforce much—needed change.

day. It's sad to relate that American-Catholic
bishops failed to provide specific moral direc- V
tion about voting for pro-abor-

about abortion as proclaimed
by Pope John Paul Hbut chose

tion candidates. This inaction
was truly the “silence of the
shepherds.” Their sin of omis-

to ignore papal declarations
because of economic considerations, especial-
ly employment.

The consciences of most Catholics were not
troubled by casting a vote for pro-abortion
politicians; such as Clinton and Perot. The con-
sciences of too many Catholics have become
lax and corrupt because of the commission of
repeated mortal sins never sorrowfully con-
fessed toa priest. Catholics didn't realize,

sion was mortally grievous! _
. We Catholics have forgotten that God is per-
fect love and perfect justice. If He ‘did not
chastise us for the horrible sin of abortion,
God would contradict his nature. He can
never do this. We will be punished. Only
prayer, particularly the rosary and penance,
can reduce the tribulations.

Mississippi Miracle
Majors—led Panthers beat favored Golden Eagles, 14-10

By Brian Gallagher
Sports Editor

HATTIESBURG, MISS. —
Twenty years later Johnny’s
magic lives on.

Adding to his a1ready—leg-

lendary reputation for resuscitat-

ing dormant football programs,

head coach Johnny Majors led’

the underdog Pitt Panthers to a
14-10 victory over host
Southern Mississippi last
Thursday night:

Much like his first debut as
Panthers’ head coach in 1973,
Majors travelled down south to
pit his underdog team against a
talented southern school. But
instead of returning from Dixie
with a tie, as he did two
decades ago versus Georgia, 7-
7, Majors came flying home
with an improbable win over
the USM Golden Eagles.

-The Pitt win spoiled a grand
opener in the muggy suburban
college town of Hattiesburg,
which literally closed up at

noon to gear up for the ESPN

nationally-televised game.

A raucous crowd of 25,516,
USM’s largest in four years, all-
but—fil1ed Roberts Stadium,
anticipating a blowout victory

_ that would never happen.

‘After the game, an emotional-
ly spent Majors reacted to the
shocker of a victory

standpoint, this was one of the
most exciting games to watch
and be part of,” Majors said
after the game. “I’ve never had
a team ﬁght harder in my life.
It’s a big win against a great,
well—coached team.” '

HATTIESBURG, MISS. —-3. football team.

Amidst crawfish and gumbo,
nudie bars andporn shops,
and hurricanes and beer, a
proud Pitt fan stood.

Make that four Pitt fans.

It was Bourbon Street, New
Orleans. Friday, Sept. 3, 11 at
night — day two of Johnny's
triumphant return —— and two
couples were reliving the
fresh memories of their teams’

. upset win the night before. _

. We were a story above -

nl photo boy and I — downing

crawfish and Cajun fries at a
place called Sammy’s. It was

here that we determined that A

contact should be made with
our fair Pitt alums (make that
future — pray — alums).

“Hey, Pitt! Hey, Pitt! Pitt!
Pitt!_”

There was an electricity in
the faces of the quartet as one
by one they looked up at us.
.It was an electricity oft created
by a common beverage

This shining happiness,
though, was no direct ‘affect of
an alcoholic cause (well, at
least not totally). It was pride
spurred by the heroics of
Johnny Majors and the Pitt

“Last night was great,” said
the man with the “PITT” hat,
when askedlby one nosy and
semi-intoxicated writer about
the Pitt game. “They were
unbelievable. Johnny’s back!”

Midway through the two-
minute interlude (a.k.a. shout-
fest), the man with the “PITT”
hat divulged his identity.

“My son is number 71,” he

I said, talking of one Dave

Kristofic, Jr. “I_’m Dave, Sr.”

Gallagher

The conversation ended
shortly thereafter — there’s
only so much balcony-shout-_
ing one can do — and we
returned to our fish. But the
memory of a proud Pitt parent
remained.

Here were Pitt faithful 
partying in New Orleans
after a big win!

Sounds familiar, huh?

Better yet, here were Pitt
fans proud to be anywhere in
America  showing off their
Panther Pride to anyone who
cared to see.

Tailback Curtis Martin led the
Pitt offensive attack with a pair
of touchdowns (one rushing,
one receiving). He led the
Panthers in both rushing and
receiving — grounding out 68
yards on 21 carries while catch-

johnny works fast, don’t he?

The other couple present at
the anything-but—historic Pitt
meeting on Bourbon was
even more intriguing. See, this
duo couldn’t change flights
after the game was switched
 yet they still came down
Big deal, right? Right. They
seemed more thrilled than the
gameday-present Kristofics
And they were ecstatic.

It was more Pitt pride than I
saw all last year. Or the year
before. ‘

All in two minutes.

And you thought Superman
was the “Man of Steel?”

After witnessing the
immense drawing power of
the ever—magne_tic, ever-
omnipresent Johnny Majors —
via partying in New Orleans,
post-game celebration in
Hattiesburg or on every billy
board in Pittsburgh, it -has
become more and more
apparent that Pitt is going
“Back to the Future” after all.

That taste of Bourbon pride
will rear its beautiful head in
Oakland this Saturday  and
throughout the 1995 season.
Sure, it may not result in a
national champion-esque

Pitt Volleyball suﬂers tbrouglo tzzrmoil, goes 1-2 at PS U Invite

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staff Writer

UNIVERSITY PARK, PA. —
The Pitt volleyball team spent
much of Friday in doubt of
whether or not it would even
play its season opener against
Penn State University at the
PSU Classic. I

The road into the campus
was closed as police hunted for
an ex-Marine who had
squeezed off a few shots from
a semi-automatic weapon at a
construction site before going
into hiding at about 8 a.m. He
was later found dead and the
road was reopened at 5 p.m.,

two and one half hours-before

the match.

Pregame warm ups turned
out to be more hazardous for
the Panthersas outside hitter
Ann Marie Lucanie twisted her
right ankle, an injury that
would limit her all weekend.

With Lucanie hobbling and

Pitt’s defense having problems, A

the Lions were able to control
the match and sweep the
Panthers 15-12, 15-8, 15-5. Pitt
put together its best match of
the weekend in a four-game
loss to Nebraska Saturday, fol-
lowed by a 15-11, 16-14, 15-10,
win over Southern Illinois.

The Panthers charged out to
a, 9-2, lead against Penn State
behind the solid attacking of
Carrie Thornton (four kills in
the game) and several Lion
errors.

“[At that point] I was think-
ing, if we ,don’t have the pre-

season injuries, we beat this 1

team,” Panther head coach
Cindy Braziel said. -

Penn State got its attack on
track and scored eight of‘ the
next nine points and tied the
game at, 10-10, on a tip shot by
setter Salima Davidson. Penn
State scraped out the win
though, with junior middle
blocker Saundi Lamoureux
closing Pitt out with an easy
kill into an open court.

“I thought that once we start-
ed to play [well], Pitt started
making some mistakes and it
snowballed in a positive way
for us," Penn State head coach
Russ Rose said.

Pitt was never able to get its
defense straightened out as the
Lions controlled the rest of the
match, keyed by the hitting of
Lamoureux‘(nine kills) and
1992 all-Big 10 selection Laura
Cook (12 kills).

“Overall, our offensive game
was much better than our
defensive game, which I am
kind of excited about because
our defensive game is some-
thing we can control a lot
more,” Braziel said. “You either
have attackers or you don’t,
and you can train the defensive
aspect. It’s our ball control and
defense which is not where it
needs to be.”

Lucanie and setter Annemarie
Mernagh were not where the
Panthers needed them to be in
the Nebraska match. They were
on the bench resting injuries.
Mernagh had been struggling
with shin splints during the
preseason and could not play
every match this weekend.

.,..,k. . ,

Lucanie’s ankle was sore and
could only play one of
Saturday’s two matches.

Thornton took up the slack
again, filling in as Pitt’s go-to
attacker. Rookie Laurie
Fernandez moved over from
outside hitter to setter. She had
not set in two years.

“Given the circumstances that
she was. basically thrown into
she did a great job,” assistant
coach Brian Begor said.

Pitt continued to press the
Cornhuskers with balanced
attacking and excellent serving.
After losing the first two games
15-8 and 15-10, the Panthers
charged back from a 7-1 deficit
to win their first game of the
season 15-11 to stretch the
match to four games.

“To win [a game] against
Nebraska  that was neat to
take a game off them  my
first collegiate game win,”
Braziel said. i

Braziel would have to wait
for her first match win. The
Cornhuskers took an early lead
and held on to win game four,

“We probably played our

Illinois. Fatigue was Pitt’s major
enemy in a sloppy win.

“We played a long match

against Nebraska,” Begor said.
“More importantly, to play at
the level we did against
Nebraska, we had to be at an
abnormally-high level emotion-
ally. We did that for one hour,
45 minutes and turned around
and played [such a short time]
later.”

Lucanie and Mernagh both
returned for the match. Lucanie
made the difference with 16
kills, 13 digs and five service
aces despite the ankle injury.
Braziel said Lucanie might have
had to come out if the match
had gone beyond three games.

“She’s tough,” Begor said.
“She knew the team needed

. her to be out there.”

Fernandez, back at outside
hitter, chipped in 11 ‘kills while
Thornton contributed eight to
go along with 11 digs. Braziel
was able to get her first match
win as head coach against
friendly rival Sonya Locke,
Southern Illinois’ head coach.

“[Lockel and I are both from
South Bend, Ind.,” Braziel said.

Asst. Sports Writer

Greg Beatty scored the first
of his two goals at the 39-
minute mark of the first half,
leading host Bucknell to a 3-0
victory over the Pitt soccer
team in the season opener for
both schools.

“It was a helluva goal,” Pitt
defender Bob Dyer said of
Beatty’s first tally. “The guy was
marked really well. It was a
cross, and he got a foot on it
before I could get to him.”

Beatty’s scored his second
goal at 16:23 of the first to put
the Bisons up 2-0. Ryan Buccer
added his first of the year at
5:26 of the second.

“They physically dominated
the “game,” Pitt head coach Joe
Luxbacher said. “They scored a
couple of weird goals but they
really dominated us  which I
didn’t expect.”

Pitt goalkeeper Adam Spitzer
had a rough outing in his first
game since a remarkable rook-
ie season last year, stopping
only six of nine shots, while
Bucknell counterpart Mark

Wrigley stopped all of the 19
Pitt shots on goal.

“[Wrigleyl was outstanding
but he wasn’t the reason [they
wonl,” Dyer said.

“The reason was that we
didn’t play like we can. Our
team needed defense to win,
and it didn’t show ups There
wasn’t any individual that
played very badly, but the
defense as a whole was bad.”

“We had some guys that we
thought gave a good effort but
didn’t make the plays,”
Luxbacher said.

“But then we had others that
didn’t give the effort needed in
a game like that.

"We were Very disappointed.”

Pitt also fell to the Bisons last
sesaon, losing 2-1 in their
secod game of the season. The
Panthers then ran off seven
straight victories and finished
second in the Big East.

The soccerlteam will next
play on Sunday at home

Sports Editor

HATTIESBURG, MISS. —
Twenty years ago Johnny
Majors opened his first stint at
Pitt by leaning on a swift,
young tailback to carry hi
offense. ‘

Last-Thursday night Majors
did it again.

Mirroring the cumbersome

workload given to Panther 

great Tony Dorsett versus

Se“t’embe" or '9 r-“7‘"‘~i-‘1993

Georgia in 1973, Majors put the \ \

bulk of Pitt’s inexperienced 
offensive attack on the back of .

Curtis Martin.

And like the 1976 Heisman -
, ‘Trophy

winner, - Martin
responded in spectacular fash-
ion. .
Running and receiving with
equal aplomb, the junior tail-
back single-handedly sustained
Pitt’s offense in the Panthers’
stunning 14-10 upset over
Southern Mississippi —— rushing
for 68 yards and a touchdown
on 21 carries.

“[Martin] did a great job for

us tonight,” Majors said of his ‘

star tailback. “Whatever it takes
to win, [Martin] did.”

Showing his versatility out of
the backfield, Martin also
accounted for a team-best
seven receptions for 84 yards

and a touchdown.

With young sophomore quar-
terback John Ryan struggling in
his first start ever and backup

tailback Tim Collichio out with 1

a shoulder injury, S Martin
picked up the «slack for the Pitt
attack from the beginning —
frequently touching the ball on
four and five plays at a time.

“I’ve never really worked or

Martin credited his new

too many turnovers,” USM head
coach Jeff Bower said. “Credit
coach Majors and his staff. Pitt
has some good skilled offen-

us tough.”

Pitt jumped on top, 7-0, early

Starting from the Golden

Tech. Southern Miss (0-1).gets
a week off before facing
Northeast Louisiana Sept. 18.

PITT NOTES: Tumulty was
named Big East Conference
Defensive Player of the Week
yesterday for his monster effort
against USM.

Ryan, the first person other
than Alex Van Pelt to start at
quarterback for Pitt since
Darnell Dickerson in 1988, was
12-for-18 passing for 118 yards
and a touchdown. He was
sacked seven times.

Kevin Leon, named starting
punter just before kickoff, had
a stellar opener ——- eight punts
with a 48.9 yard average

—- or the next five (Though
several rookie Panthers beg to
differ.) — but it will be there.
Like it was last Thursday
night at approximately 10 p.m.
Central Time, when a classic-
looking Pitt football team
pranced off the field to the

the 450-plus Panther fans.

Front and center in the love-
fest was the man who made
the Mississippi Miracle possible
— a drenched and spent 58-
year coach from Tennessee.

As he sat in a dank, smelly
weight room following Pitt’s
14-10 upset win, Majors magic
kicked in.

“This game really, really
touched me,” Majors said. “I’ve
never had a team fight harder
in my life.”

He was about to cry, the stur-
dy, tough coach was.

 

  

He "could barely contain the
sincere pride he had for his
players —— men he knew less
than a years’ time.

“I’ve never been more proud
of a football team in my life,”
he said.

There will be no national
championship in Pittsburgh in
1993—— the dream of Southern
Miss will slide into emphatic
reality when an Ohio State,
Miami or Notre Dame comes a
calling.

But this inaugural season has
already been a sure—fire success
for one reason: where three
coaches couldn’t build it in 10
years, Majors brought back Pitt
Pride in one night. i

Just remember that night in
Hattiesburg. Or my night on
Bourbon Street.

  Martin  

Continued from page 13

"He motivates the team 
everybody going until the
last second,” he said.

Majors’ influence was
never more evident than at
halftime, . according to
Martin, when Pitt trailed the
Golden Eagles, 10-7.

“It didn’t feel like we were
down [at halftimel,” Martin
said. I

“If you were outside the

- locker room looking in, you
would’ve thought that we
were winning the game. No
one was getting on each
other  having attitudes,
arguing.

“The attitude that Coach
Majors has impressed upon
the team is ‘we’re never giv-
ing up.’ We didn’t.”

Majors’ “never—give—up”
attitude must have left a dis-
tinct impression on Martin.
Thursday night, he‘ rarely
gave up on a rushing
attempt — carrying the

pigskin on 21 of Pitt’s 27
carries. ‘

“Actually, that’s what I
hoped for. That’s what all
running backs hope for  to
get the ball all the time,”
Martin said. “I’m not a self-
ish player, but it happened
that way and I’m thankful
for it.”

And so is Pitt.

PITT NOTES: Despite
Martin's 68'yards on the
ground, Pitt officially gained
35 yards on 41 carries — an
average of less than one
yard per cariy. Most of that

came via the hem Miss.

defense, which sacked John
Ryan. seven times.

The Golden Eagles rushed
for 164 yards on 46 carries.

Pitt came home with the
victory despitelosing the
total yards battle, 296-151.

Martin had the longest run
from scrimmage — 15 yards
—— on Pitt's opening offen-
sive series.

THE PI'IT NEWS, Tuesdaz, September 7, 1993

Continued from page 11
“It’s kind of strange to get to

that point, coaching against _

people you’ve played with.”

Before the weekend, Begor
said that playing top teams like
Penn State and Nebraska would
give Pitt a chance to find its
weaknesses.

“To a person, we have to be
better disciplined defensively,”
Begor said. “We will address
that immediately when we get
back. There were a lot more
positives than there were nega-
tives. ‘

“I think right now we might
be better offensively than
defensively.

"That’s the good news and
it’s the bad news. Given our
size, to be a great team we
need to be great defensively.”
