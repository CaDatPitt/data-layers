Univgrsﬂy Dams CMU conference to

host state rep
Greg Fajt  

By Christopher Lawrence
Senior Staff Writer

Despite the Republican tide that swept
across the g.overnment in 1994, all is not lost
on the Democratic front.

Educational reform, socioeconomic changes
and Gov. Ridge’s budget were among the
issues raised at last night’s meeting of the
University Democrats.

State Rep. Greg Fajt spoke to the group and,
in addition to answering questions, discussed
his ideas on how the Democrats need to
respond to the recent Republican swing in the
government.

The American people want ‘fless taxes and
less government,” Fajt said. This is a simple
solution"that the Republicans have overem-
phasized and made into an art form.

“There’s nothing wrong with Democrats
wanting fewer taxes and a more efficient gov-
ernment,” Fajt said.

University Democrat President Dan Corle
agreed with Fajt on that point.

“Democrats need to be able to look at things
and realize that they need to be changed,”
Corle said. “Too often Democrats are seen as
a bastion of protecting programs. Rather than
just protect those programs, they need to find
a way to change them.” _

Fajt came to the meeting directly from
Harrisburg, where he was looking over Gov.
Ridge’s proposed budget. According to Fajt,
the budget does not call for an increase in
appropriations to state-funded universities,
such as Pitt.

address police brutality

By James Ruffin
For The Pitt News

A conference aimed at stopping
police brutality and discussing the
death of Jonny Gammage is being
held at CMU this Saturday at
Porter Hall 100 from 1-7 pm.

The “Jonny Gammage and the
Fight Against Police Brutality”
conference is being put together by
Pitt and CMU students and staff as
well as community activists. It’s an
effort to gain public support for
justice in the Jonny Gammage case
and to educate students and the
surrounding community about the
case and the issue of police brutali-
ty- _
Organizer Pete Shell said the
idea for the conference came from
Richard Lyons, a juror on the coro-
ner’s inquest into Gammage’s
death.

Shell said the conference orga-
nizers put a letter on the Internet
and “got people who were interest-
ed in Gammage’s case, because
nothing was being done.”

Originally the jury in the

Gammage case voted unanimously ‘

that the five Brentwood police offi-
cers should be charged with crimi-
nal homicide, but later the charges
were lowered to involuntary
manslaughter.

“We think the Brentwood police
should be prosecuted in order to

prevent police brutality,” Shell
said.
The conference will feature

- keynote speaker Lorenzo Ko_m’boa

Ervin, an anti’-police brutality
activist who has experienced police
brutality himself. _

Ervin, a former Black Panther,
ﬂed the country in 1968 on charges
of gun-running and faced shoot—to-
kill orders from the policeand FBI.
He was forced to return after being”
captured and beaten by U.S.
agents. He served 15 years of two.
life sentences before he
was released in 1983.

The conference will feature sev-
eral other notable speakers such as

‘City Councilman Sala Udin:

Khalid Rahim of the Million Man
March Organizing Committee: the
director of the Western
Pennsylvania Committee to Free
Mumia, Jamila Levi; Ishmael
El’Amin of the Coalition of‘
African—Americans for Justice; and
the director of the Pittsburgh
American Civil Liberties Union,
Vic Walczak.

The conference will also feature
eyewitness testimonials, including
testimony from Stevenson Bey, the
father of Maneia Bey, who was
murdered by the police. Workshops
will also be held on combating
police brutality, legal issues and
rights, political repression and
police, and the police and racism.

BAS celebrates its heritage

By Isis Prior
For The Pitt News

The Black Action Society, one of the
largest student groups with 1,500
undergraduate members, is celebrating
Black History Month with a full calen-
dar of lectures, discussions, workshops,
demonstrations and discussions
designed to educate not only black stu-
dents about their own culture but the
entire student body as a whole.

“The most important thing is to edu-
cate others about black history and why
we should have a month,” said Keyne
Johnson, deputy chairperson of BAS.

In February 1926, ‘G. Carter
Woodson, a Harvard Ph.D., initiated
“Negro History Week” as a way to
remind people of their ethnic heritage
and promote understanding and mutual
respect among different racial groups
in the United States.

February was chosen because both
Frederick Douglass and Abraham
Lincoln have birthdays in that month.

During America’s 1976' Bicentennial,
the Association for the Study of
African-American Lifeand History,
Inc. expanded the week’s celebration to
include the entire month of February to
give more time for programs and cele-
brations.

BAS kicked off its programs on the
first with a “Black History Month Kick-
Off Rally” and has activities scheduled
nearly every day until the end of
February.

The programs include voter registra-
tion, several lectures by keynote speak-
ers, a demonstration of capoiera (an
African danceand martial art form) and
workshops dealing with relationships.
Also planned is the second annual

B-lack Leadership Conference, to be‘

held on Feb. 23.
This conference will take a look at

lAS VEEA

the problems of the past, what is hap-
pening now and how students can learn
from both in order to make the future
better.

“I am really looking forward to the
Black Leadership Conference. It
encompasses a lot of important areas
that black students need to concern
themselves with because we are moving
into the 21st century. It is going to be
exciting,” said Leslie Burrell, executive
secretary for BAS.

The month is about celebrating the
history of a culture which has been vir-

Everyone can benefit from informa-
tion about being better prepared in soci-
ety and how to be more effective lead-
ers in an increasingly diverse world.
Those are some of the issues that will
be focused on in the student panel dis-
cussion on Feb. 24.

Some black students are pleased that
there is a month for the observance of
their history, but they are displeased
that there must be a time designated.

“Although I am looking forward to it,
it means very little to me,” said Oronde
Sharif, BAS member and graduate stu-
dent. “You can’t celebrate thousands of

“The lTlOSt important thing IS years of history in one month. You can

only touch on things.”

lar month to learn about black culture

history and why we should allows students to neglect learning

about their heritage until February.

“I am not happy that there is just one
month,” said Burrell. “It is an ongoing
process of learning that should take
place every day, especially for black

-Keyne Johnson, deputy chairperson of students. Just one month makes stu-

dents complacent towards their own

the Black Action Society history, but I am looking forward to it.”

“Black history should be recognized

tually ignored by many history books.

“We have earned this through the tri-
als and tribulations that we have passed
through,” said Johnson.

Woodson created this period of time
in the name of education and under-
standing. What that means and what
BAS wants to stress is that Black
History Month is for all students, black
or not.

“[The goal is the] promotion of unity
as well as seeing not only the black stu-
dent body benefit from all the events
but also the whole student body,” said
Johnson. “Everything will apply to
everyone. I think that everyone, black
and white, should participateein the
activities because it is an education.”

Although students may be disappoint-

History Month is still important for
black students.

-“[The month] provides hope for us,
something that is ours because we were

" Regardless of race, all Pitt students

month, everyone can find something

niques to create unity,
despite differences,”
Yukihiro Goto, the guest
director for the production
and trainer in the
Suzuki Method, said.

Goto, a tenured professor
at San Francisco State
University, has spent the
last month in Pittsburgh
directing the production.
His Ph.D work was done
with Tadashi Suzuki, the
adapter of “Clytemnestra”
and creator of the Suzuki
Method.

Stylized movements in
the form of dances, fight
scenes and maintaining
completely frozen positions
while delivering strong
speeches are part of the
elements that make up the
action in “Clytemnestra,”
Goto said.

Suzuki training includes
an exercise called sitting
and standing statues, where
a position is picked and
held while yelling out a
rehearsed speech. The
actors also learned nine
types of walking which
included variations on
marching, stomping and
walking on toes. During

tion is chosen and held.
While the movements are
strong and forceful, there is
a certain grace that comes
from the precise execution.

Though the training was

“[Through the training]
you become more aware of
where every part of your
body is,” she said.

Ray Burtoff, a psycholo-
gy major who plays one of
the citizens, agreed that the
discipline and focus
learned in the training was
essential to his perfor-
mance.

“The training requires a
lot of focus and disci-

high degree of stylization,
if a position is to be frozen,
there can be no loss of bal-
ance.

“One move could wreck
the ambience of the scene,”
Burtoff said.

Goto said that Suzuki
training is a basis for the
actors to «build on. It
requires grounding, bal-
ance, strength, coordina-
tion, stamina and focus,
applicable to any perform-
ing art form.

The intense training also
united the actors, Burtoff
said, which helped increase
the quality of the perfor-
mance.

“Shared pain is always a

said.

that Goto stressed was unit-

duction’s run, he asked that
the cast continue to nurture
the bond they have created.
Before each performance
he asked for then to form a
circle and recite a Japanese
passage. When translated,
it carries the meaning of
“Please look out for me. I
will look out for you.”

Historically, according to
Goto, the myths of
Agamemnon, Clytemnestra,
Orestes and Electra still
have a profound impact on
us. But to reinforce the
power of the play, Goto
updated it for today’s gen-
eration.

Grotesqueness and spec-
tacle, particularly in the
feast scene where the citi-
zens vomit on stage, will
add to the visual imagery
painted on the stage, Goto
said. Music by the industri-
al rock band Ministry
accentuates the tensions
and power of the story.

“The audience feels it get
into their heart,” Goto said,

"‘and the image is seen on

the stage.”

“Clytemnestra” opens
tonight at 8 p.m. in the

Theater.

“The state government
sends Pitt $138 million to
help keep tuition costs
down,” Fajt said. “Unless
Pitt cuts costs to counteract
inflation, your tuition will
go up.”

Members of the
University Democrats hope
that» state-funded universi-
ties will be able to success-
fully lobby against the bud-
get in Harrisburg and keep
the tuition increases to a
minimum. The group urged
Fajt to vote against the
budget '

“I think that funding edu-
cation is one of the wisest
and best uses of govern-
ment,” Fajt said, “and 1
think that Democrats need
to stand for that.”

Othertopics raised at the

. meeting included the possi-

bility of volunteering in
various campaigns in the
area and the importance of
voter registration. Members
also had the opportunity to
sign a petition to put Bob
Casey, son of the former
Pennsylvania governor, on
the ballot for auditor
general.

Opinions
Who's the real idiot?

“Three generations of idiots is more than enough.” These
words of one eminent member of the United States Supreme
Court in the decision of Buck v. Bell were madelmany years
ago. The case was about whether or not someone could force
a mentally retarded woman to be sterilized, since she was the
third generation in her family to be mentally handicapped.

Most people would have expected this kind of statement to
have gone out the window decades ago. But along with
racism and sexism comes a special breed of people who dis-
criminate against mentally retarded people.

Everyone can remember the old Archie Bunker shows,
with comments like “There goes the neighborhood” when a
black family moved into ‘the area. This kind of thing, unfor-
tunately, has not been limited to the bigoted world of Bunker.
Today, in real life, there are people saying things just like
that.

North Huntingdon, a little community in Westmoreland
County, _is the site of the latest display of stupidity. A group
which runs supervised living homes for mentally retarded
citizens established one of its homes in a Westmoreland
neighborhood, and some neighbors are up in arms. They
have called the place a halfway house and claim it is going to
lower the property values in the area.

Technically, the neighbors are right. It is a kind of halfway
house. But that is the only thing on which they are even
close. This is not the kind of halfway house which shelters
drug addicts and ex—convicts while they ‘perpetrate their next
crimes. It is not intended to be a drug rehabilitation center or
a base for convicts on house arrest. It is a place for people
who are mentally retarded. They have committed no crime,
and they have done nothing wrong. '

Secondly, if the existence of a supervised group home low-
ers the property value in the neighborhood, it is only because
people are willing to let that happen. If,_because of this
home, you are so anxious to leave the area that you sell your
house forless than it is worth, you don’t deserve what you
got, let alone anything more.

Mental retardation has always been misunderstood by soci-
ety. Until just a few decades ago, the mentally ill were com-
mitted to insane asylums and given barely enough food to
survive. Treatment of mental illness onlybegan in earnest
over the last 30 or so years. But, fortunately, modern science
and caring people have made huge strides in helping mental-
ly retarded people live and function as normally as possible.

It is a shame that there are still people who would rather
see mentally retarded people put back intoasylums or sana-
toriums. They are the ones‘ who throw the names “idiot” or
“moron” at a mentally handicapped person. But maybe they
need to think about what names they are throwing around so
casually; the names might suit them better.

eaTeN’?!

So, once again the university
has formed a TASK FORCE to
combat potential relationships
that would be improper between
teachers and students. I think
that this is yet another example
of a good idea gone superintru-
sivepthrough University Policy.
Read on, and as they say during
half-time, you make the call.

Gerald Massey, the sub—com-
mittee chair, said, “We’re mak-
ing sure that the student—faculty
relationship is not corrupted in
any way, or compromised would
be a better word.” The word
we’re all dancing around here is
SEX. Yes, that’s right campers,
Big Brother is here to safeguard
the students from improper
SEX. Hey, Gerry, I applaud your
desire to prevent students from
being taken advantage of, but
your methods of execution leave
much to be desired.

This is not the classic, “she
said if I came to her office after
5:00, I could improve my grade”
complaint. This is the more

insidious complaint of a student

who thinks “that [the student in
the alleged relationship] is going
to get extra stuff [get your minds
out of the gutter and keep read-
ing], and that’s not fair.” I will
forego my diatribe on the “it’s
not fair” whiners outthere,
except to say that isn’t it scary
that the fact those words were
used to implement policy could
destroy a teacher’s career?

Well, now tl1ere’s the rub, as
my grandfather would say. Who

is going to decide if there is an ~

“improper relationship” taking
place? How exactly will the
Inquisitors investigate the parties

. involved? What if I receive the

A that I deserve and another stu-
dent wants to hurtme or the pro-
fessor? Can we all see the poten-
tial for abuse here by the dis-
gruntled students among us? Are
professors now to be monitored
during their office hours by a

.'university “facilitator” to ensure
there.has been no impropriety,

consensual or otherwise? What
if _the accused are of the‘-same

gender? Is this university really
planning on asking tofadults
whether or not they are involved
in a homosexual ‘relationship?
The Supreme Court ruled that

the government can’t do it, so‘

why ‘does the university feel it
can intrude on the faculty’s and
students’?-lives in such an illegal
and obviously unconstitutional
manner? Are we really going to
expect teachers to indulge the
love of their lives (teaching, that
is — keep your minds out of the
gutter) if they think that they are
risking their careers to spend
time with their students who
come to them outside of class?
For instance, if I think that a
teacher_and a fellow student are
spending too much time together
outside of class I am told to

report "them to the Powers That .

Be. Then Big Brother empanels
the Inquisitors to “extract the
truth” from the defendants who
are (by default) GUILTY of
moral turpitude and must defend
the amount of time they spend
with students. Sound too bizarre
to happen here?

“Professor X, isn’t it true you
and Student Y were seen smok-
ing together after class every day
outside of the Cathedral?” '

“Yes, but we both smoke.”

“Is it not also true that you
were seen SMILING, LAUGH-
ING, TELLING JOKES and
TOUCHlNG!?!”. .

“Uh, yeah. I handed him a cig-
arette, held the lighter up to it
and burned my hand. Ask him if
there was anything improper
about it.” I I "T .

“Is it not true you also were
seen in the same establishment
having lunch _together . ”

“Yes, my department head i.

“Rights? Rights? You signed a-
contract with this business  er
 university. Therefore you are
here on a ‘voluntary basis.”’

“Thanks. I’ll just be on my
way now.” '

' “If you leave now we will
consider it an admission of guilt

and act accordingly: This is the L

can ruin a teacher’s career and
damage the university -as a
whole. I’d hate to think that the

and spies in Hemingway’s —

me if I’m mistaken here. but

Wallace admitted

that former Syracuse
great Derrick Coleman was
his idol. All the way down
to the same No. 44 jersey,
Wallace has done his best
Coleman impersonation in
his four-year stint as an
Orangeman. _

But it wasn’t until this

Wallace, who almost made

the fatal mistake of going

boards, but even those num-

Panthers lose by six to No. 16 Syracuse

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

In the first half it was all
Syracuse’s big men, John
Wallace and Otis Hill. In the

second half, Syracuse looked _

more to its backcourt, which

almost proved fatal for the
Orangemen. .
But in the end, another Pitt
comeback fell short, as
Syracuse squeezed past the
Panthers, 73-67 last night.
“It’s unbelievably disap-
pointing,” said Pitt forward

Chad Varga, who finished

with a career—high 26 points.

“You’ve got to want to win.
We need to sustain pressure
for 40 minutes, not when
we’re down 15 points.”
Wallace scored 25 points
and grabbed 11 rebounds,

Notre Dame ramps

Lady Panthers, 90-51  

By Kevin Lilley
Staff Writer

The Pitt Lady Panthers traveled to South Bend «yesterday to play the
Notre Dame Fighting Irish for the first time in history. Their hosts
greeted them with ‘a 90-51 blowoutvictory, starting the series off in

style in front of the home crowd

The Irish dominated on both ends of the court all night, out-
rebounding the Lady Panthers 38-19 under the defensive glass while
hitting 54 percent of their shots for the evening. Pitt could only muster
a 30 percent clip from the ﬂoor, including a 6-32 shooting effort in the

first half.

6 Notre Dame capitalized on Pitt’s errant shots, streaking to a 24-2
lead and coasting intothe locker room with a 50-15 halftime edge.
The Irish were led by forward Beth Morgan, who scored 26 points
while playing only 21 minutes_the entire game. Morgan and fellow
starters Katryna Gaither and Mollie Perick combined for 51 points,
enough to equal the Panthers’ offensive production. A
The offensive production of the Irish left nothing to the imagination,
with the Notre Dame squad ballooning the lead to 78-25 at the 11:54
mark of the second half. Pitt managed to outscore the Irish 26-12 for
the remainder of the contest, with both teams going to their bench.
Reserve forward Kelly Senneca led all Lady Panthers with nine
points and center Latia Howard led the Pitt starters with ﬁve points
and four rebounds. Starting guards JoJo Guzman and Stephanie Pedro
went a combined 2-16 for just four points. V -
The Lady Panthers drop to 4-17 on the year with the defeat, includ-
ing a 3-9 mark in the Big East Conference. The 24th-ranked Irish
improve to 15-5, with a 10-2 mark in their first year of Big East play.

and Hill finished one point
shy of tying his career—high,
with 21, as ‘Syracuse
increased its record to 17-6
overall and 7-5 in the Big
East.

The Panthers stand at 9-10
overall and 4-7 in the con-
ference. Pitt drops below
.500 for the first time since
it was 1-2 after losing to
Boston College Dec. 6.

A crowd of 15,016 specta-
tors at the Civic Arena saw
Hill score_18 points and
Wallace 12 in the first 20
minutes, as they tore apart
the inside of Pitt’s zone
defense the entire frame. The
duo scored 30 of Syracuse’s
37 first-half points.

“Two things were evident
this game,” said Pitt Coach
Ralph Willard. “The inside
play hurt us. Wallace and
Hill just manhandled us.
Then down the stretch we
had the opportunity to win
and it didn’t happen.”

Pitt switched between its
1-3-1 and 2-3 zones for most
of the half. Instead of rely-
ing on 3-pointers from the
perimeter, Syracuse looked
tofast break,-and if that
didn’t work, penetrate the
zone and pound the ball
inside to its big men.

When Wallace got the ball
down low, the Panthers tried
to double team him. But they
forgot to cover Hill, and
Wallace took advantage of it.

From Dusk Till Dawn
Directed by Robert Rodriguez
With Quentin Tarantino,
George Clooney,
Keitel and Juliette Lewis

Two brothers start on the
voyage of From Dusk Till
Dawn with a liquor store
shoot-out, some snappy dia-
logue and a flaming teller who
is hot enough to pop popcorn.
The two havoc-wreakin’ broth-
ers are Seth (George
Clooney) and Richard Gecko
(Quentin Tarantino). Clooney’s
character is a superbad situa-
tion-handler with some bad
lines lifted from some of
America’s best heroes and
Dirty Harry’s .44 Magnum to
boot. On the other hand (with
a hole in it), we have
Tarantino’s character —— we're
told by his police description
that he’s a bank-robbing sex-
offender, which is inevitably
played out very well on one of
the Geckos’ hostages.

The task at hand for the
Gecko brothers is to high-tail it
out of Texas, for the mere rea-
son that they have killed and
robbed their way through the
state. The border is no easy
task, especially if you are
wanted. This is where the
Fuller family rolls in, literally in
a Winnebago. Jacob Fuller
(Harvey Keitel) is the ex-
p_reacher god interest with the
Geckos’ ticket to Mexico and
his children Kate Fuller
(Juliette Lewis) — better
known as “app|e-pie pussy,”

. courtesy of Cheech —- and her

brother Scott (Ernest Liu). It
ends up that the Geckos and
the Fullers bump heads in a
shitty motel on the way to the
border. By way of force,
Magnum Force that is, the
Geckos convince the Fullers
to do the-hide-the-convicts-in-

Harvey

-~ /3;

The

the-Winnebago-gig.

After making it across the
border, the Geckos’ next stop
is this hell-bent-for-leather bar
in the middle of the desert
called the Titty Twister. This
place is a character onto itself,
all equipped with the bikers,
fire and one bad-mouthed
whorehouse barker (Cheech
Marin). Cheech has one of the
most memorable scenes in the
picture where he has a little

  th  

sing-song with the word
“pussy” being said over and
over. its an absolute gut
buster. The Titty Twister is the
meeting spot for the Geckos
and some of their hoodlum
cronies. The only catch is
(hence the title of thepicture)
they have to meet in the morn-
ing. So holy hell, guess what
the bar really is, a front for
some blood thirsty vampire
motherfuckers.

e Bloods

The final conflict takes these
bad-guys-turned-good, who
now got a preacher with fami-
ly-in-tow, a couple of B-movie
stars and a sex machine on
their side, to battle with a thou-
sandcreepy crawlers of the
night. In a head-Iopping,
blood-sucking battle for‘

Spike Jonze) and a more mel-
low approach to the world
that's moving somewhere
beween J.J. and Raj in the
“hyper” spectrum. The rhymes
of Labcab are midnight excur-
sions of the mind to Bizzare’s
invitations to mischief, and
beats are chilled, jettisoning
the smart-ass playground in
favor of sweet harmonies and
showing that the four can
carry a tune as quick as they
can drop a rhyme. The beats
have simplified, the produc-
tion slowed down and where-
as voices are a bit disjunctive
on Bizzare Ride, the
Pharcyde sticks with verses til
the completions on Labcab
and rides them through silk
loops that their debut didn't
have.

Lyrically, Labcab is a more
mature, reflective album than
the previous, as the group
raps about the ‘responsibili-
tites of life, love and the road
with but a passing interest in
the sophomoric that dominat-
ed Bizzare Ftide. They never
hesitate to drop the (sur)Fleal,
and their rhymes move from
cosmicbraggadocio (“The
crew definitely is back
again/So just tell a friend/T hat
l’m still/Twisting and bend-
ing/Minds and rhymes until
the very end”) to regretfully
ownin’ up to shit they high-
fived about on Bizzare Hide
(“Oh I suppose I guess I got
myself to blame for turnin’/her
out into a hip hop freak/Now I
seek counseling for a thera-

their Fat Albert van into
Metropol tonight at 7:30 for an
evening of quiet conversation
and mama jokes that’re sure
to rival the best playground
banter you've never heard:
“Your mama's got a glass eye
with a fish in it.” Don't under-
stand? They’re sure that
that's the point. As they
demonstrated on ‘92’s
Bizzarre Fiide /I The
Pharcyde, their Delicious
Vinyl debut, it’s not what you
know but what you remember:
smackin’ off, bustin’ on
mamas and longing for the
girl whojust ain't to be.

lmani, Booty Brown, Fatlip
and SlimKid3 are fresh off
their second album, the
acclaimed Labcabincalifornia,
with a hit vid (directed by

 

pist twice a week”) to eventual
artist-as-victim philosophising
(“‘Cause/Everytime I step to
the microphone/I put my soul
on 2" reels/T hat I don ’t even
own”).

It might not be as fun as
their debut (read as: you
won’t be bustin’ your rom-
mate's shit in new and inven-
tive ways), but in the end, it’s
probably more artistically
worthwhile and, withthe help
of Jonze and a pair of moder-
ately—roated videos (“Runnin”’
and “Drop,” on which the
B’Boys’ “New Style” is sam-
pled), a more commercially
viable album than their debut.
That’s for the better, because
success can only equal stay-
ing power, which can only
equal more shows —— some-
thing that spawned as
dancers in a Herb Alpert
video and was cultivated at
AIDS benefits (complete with
drag queens) and on
LoI|apalloza’s second stage.
And, with cornermen in Mike
D and Ad Rock, and damn-
near perfection in “Bizzare
Ride’s” “Passin’ Me By,” it’s
lookin’ to be a smooth ride for
the crew of Sanford-and-Son-
junkies-made-good. The
Pharcyde comes crossin’-
over like Van Exel tonight at
Metropol with Seventh
House  and leave your
Celtic shit at home. 7:30

Sirius Sounds

Children of the Bong
Planet Dog/Mammoth

I always seem to find myself
happily traipsing in the out-
reaches of the elite stellar
music world and this time l’ve
found something for the more
earthbound electro-junkies,
who always want to know if
you can dance to it. A stupid
question to answer for those
of us who can do a kickstep to
the pendulum sound of a drip-
py faucet. A more important
indicator of the value of elec-
tronic music is if it can suffi-
ciently equip you for space
travel. Children of the Bong
can't. But their wire-splitting,
stellar—spitting modest bass
echoes launch you safely into
the stratosphere — but that's
as far as it goes.

Alright, enough with the
space talk. “Po|yphase” catch-
es your attention and throws it
back to you with a circular
reverberation of synthesized
bubbles rising to the surface
of your speakers, but the
sound is a bit too synthetic for
my taste. There’s not a suffi-
cient interplay of sounds or
rhythms to keep your atten-
tion away from the here and

now (which great music can '

often do). “Interface Reality” is
similar in that the beats are
too rigid, raunchy and defi-
cient in soul,
Thursday night crowd at
Ze|da’s after they’ve lost their

inhibitions. (Well, maybe not 2

that bad.)

I wouldn't take Children of
the Bong too siriusly because‘
their sound is too.produced
and falls short of the plush
psychedelia needed in
orchestrating a sonic seduc-
tion which is characteristic of
good trance. “Squigglasonic",
for example, attempts a
smooth landing of turbulent
trip-hop, but instead crashes
a typical, overly computerized
sound which only Judy Jetson
can appreciate. '

The residents of Planet 12
(Friday nights from 5-7) would
politely reject the adoption of
Children of the Bong into
their Saturday night society
because its sound has lost its
soul and naturalness in the
translation. And what would it
profit an album to gain an
audience and lose its soul? Its
good, but l’ve been higher,
and as my ingenious, home-
body best friend Johnas
would say, “Why go bowling
when you can stay home and
have an orgasm?”

Mercury Rev
See You on the Other Side
WORK

Building their reputation
from two indescribable albums
and devastating live shows
(and holding the distinction of
being the only band booted
from Lollapalooza for being
too “weird") Mercury Rev,
along with their parent band,
the Flaming Lips, defined the
sound of American psychedel-
ic acid-drenched damage
throughout the late ‘80s/early
‘90s. Now with the release of
their third disc, and first with-
out head weirdo David Baker,
See You on the Other Side
marks a subtle but significant
change in sound and vision.

With guitarist Jonathan
Donahue taking over vocals
and primary songwriting

"duties, in effect driving the

   

ll

 

freakmobile known as Mercury
Rev, they find a sound only
slightly less self-consciously
bizarre than previous incarna-
tions and focus more on (com-
paratively) traditional songwrit-
ing values. Combining dreami-
ly orchestrated passages,
fuzzed-out jams, free jazz-
influenced freakouts and
melodies that could have been
fictitious ‘70s kiddie TV show
themes, Mercury Rev possess
the uncanny ability to simulta-
neously lull the listener with
childlike naiveté and deeply
disturb with unsettling under-
tones (note the back cover
photo of Donahue contemplat-
ing his revolver).

Shamelessly employing, in
addition to the standard con-
figuration of
guitar/bass/drums, string
arrangements, horn sections
(indeed the band boasts a full-
time flute player), piano,
organ, bowed saws, “mojo
stick,” tablas, “guitar shapes,”
and most likely anything else
that would make noise, in
order to fully realize their
skewed musical vision, the
band also seemingly fills every
musical inch with a mind-bog-
gling richness of multi-textured

- sound.

The Revs breeze through
eight songs such as “Young

Man's Stride," which begins
with a dub bass groove and
turns into a garage rock work-
out, and the near-disco instru-
mental “Close Encounters of
the 3rd Grade,” which sounds
as if it were lifted from
Manchester circa 1990, in just
under 40 minutes. On
“Everlasting Arm,” over a bed
of lilting pianos and saxo-
phones, Jonathan Donahue
proceeds to liken himself to a
“great big theater curtain” and
“Puerto Rican kids in a sum-
mer rain, breaking open
hydrants and going insane.” (If
anyone knows just what
Donahue’s been ingesting and
can get some more, please let
me know.) On “A Kiss from an

5

Old Flame (A Trip to the
Moon),” the band compose a
modern ballroom waltz, at
once elegant and cartoonish,
and succinctly sum up their
appeal in the lines “with the
wink of a starlet’s eye / a
string of pearls come to life /
who knows what black and
crazy thoughts / swim inside a
girlfriend’s heart?”

With See You on the Other
Side , Mercury Rev may have
finally delivered on the
promise they’ve been hinting
at for two albums by produc-
ing a work that proves not only
challenging in scope and
sheer quantity of sound but is

Canvas is a great zine that
has been going for over three

..years. I've read it off and on

and enjoyed it for most of that
time. A while ago, issue #95
showed up in my mailbox with
a note asking for a review. The
problem was, although the
issue was better than the
majority of zines I've gotten for
review, it doesn't really stack
up all that well when com-
pared to earlier issues in the
run. The editor himself says as
much in the intro.

Anyway, the zine consists of
a bunch of personal slice-of-
life type columns by different
people, most of which are real-

There’re also a bunch of

you’ve never heard of the

The problem is, these are

me stress this: I like this zine, l
have just come to expect more
from it. Actually, for all I know,
#10 may be out by now, so
hopefully these problems have
been dealt with. This issue is
$1 cash or stamps to: 2176

more issues available as well.
Check out the editor's band,
Rail, if you get the chance.

In case you haven’t noticed
yet, a good way to get a
review from me is to mention
masturbation in your zine.
Well, provoCATive #2 does,
in a satirical article about dif-
ferent methods of female mas-
turbation (“remember  left-
overs should never be thrown
out”). The rest of the zine
reads pretty quickly, with stuff
like a trip to Lollapalooza that
went on a page longer than it
should have and excerpts from
real letters sent to the editor.
The zine’s free, so you could
probably send a stamp to P.O.
Box 1636/ Auburn, Ala. 36831-
1636. Or you could start going
to local shows, and if you’re
lucky, the editor will press a

copy into your sweaty palms
(as happened to me).
ENDNOTES

-I am thinking about expand-
ing my area of coverage,
maybe writing more about the
local scene in general (as well
as continuing to write about
zines). If anyone has any
ideas, or something that they
would like to see, write to me
at: jjcst25@pitt.edu or in care
of this newspaper. ‘

-I am compiling a resource
list of all local zines, with plans
to run it either as a future col-
umn and/or put it on my web
page (|’ll tell you the address
when there’s more stuff on it).
Please send names and con-
tact addresses if known for
any and all zines and distribu-
tors. If I get enough info, I
might do a Pittsburgh scene
report for MaximumFlockNFtoIl
as well.

Shale
Shorn b/w To//cutter‘
Pop Bus

Pittsburgh’s own Shale have
been playing shows for a while
now, perfecting their skills as
indie purveyors of refined riff
rock. This 7-inch represents
their first attempt to capture
their brand of noise and may-
hem on disc. For those who
haven’t seenthem live, it
proves that Shale can stand up
as more than guys with ugly
glasses, baseball shirts and
distortion pedals — they know

- how to piece together hard riffs

into logical, precisely coordi-
nated four-minute train wrecks.
The Ieadoff track on the 7-

. inch is “Shorn,” an instrumen-“
tal sampling of the Shale»

sound. The song starts slow,
with a repetitive, hypnotic riff
that builds as all five of the
five-piece get into it. Drumming
is tight and precise, with
increasingly hard fills that lay a
groundwork for the impending
explosion into a pure hardcore,
headbang riff. Just as you get
used to the new melody, the
band shifts into high gear, tak-
ing off into metallic, treble-rich
dementia with hints of
Breadwinner influence. You
may start to wonder if you
haven't somehow bumped the

‘record player to 78 rpm. Then,

after two_measures of stop-
action-groove, the original
theme returns to close out the
song. -

“Tol|cutter,” track two of the
disc, starts ‘with a brutal
Deadguy-like assault, then
switches to trebly midtempo
hooks over a smooth and pre-
cise bass line. This song
includes vocals, but only about
three lines’ worth. In any case,
they're nicely done in a Shellac
style and add to the flavor.
Later, the tempo ups and the
band launches into a stop—and-

go, steel-'mangling‘ rhythmic

hit-fest guaranteed to get your
head nodding, even if you’re
sitting in your La-Z-Boy with a
cold drink. Just when you think

the train has ground to a mer-
ciful halt, the boys hit a quick
four-count and spin off into
more bassy bludgeoning until
the song ends.

Overall, Shale serves up
quite a nice noise-rock offer-
ing. Melodically, the songs are
a nice mix of diverse riffage
united by the toughness of
their themes and their frenetic
rhythms. Technically, the tight-
ness of the time and riff
changes tie up the diverse
melodies with their precision.
The result is music with the
power of a ConRail freight and
the impact of that train as it
jumps the tracks.

Viva! La Woman
Warner Bros. .

To convey the richness of
this intensely innovative, intri-
cately woven synthesis of
sounds would take at least four
columns, of space, and would
sound like tangled strands of
verbal spaghetti. For example,

a description of “Theme,” the
10-minute creative climax of
“Viva!” in terms of its perfect
integration of original instru-
mentation, sampling and weird
noise wizardry, could be con-
veyed like this: “Industrial
hammering noises play see-
saw with zig-zags of scraping
zithers  softened by the
cloud-like voice of a whisper-
ing Japanese angel.” And this:
“The jungle roar of an ele-
phantine trumpet is juxtaposed
by the eerie heartbeat of a far-
off Cuban kettle drum, while
layers of sound snowflakes
melt into lakes of Indian
beats.” Now, do you want to
read shit like that? Of course
not. But “Viva! La Woman” is
so well-composed, so musical-
ly colorful, so fucking great

that I feel obliged to describe it p

in this ridiculous, adjective-
laden poetic praise, and you
will too if you go out and buy
this record. So go out and buy
this record.

seas. But viewers take note:
that rousing climax doesn't
take place until about three
quarters of the way into the
picture. You’ll have to wade
through a heavy serving of
-male-bonding, coming-of-age-
type scenarios first (although
the vicious, aquatic phenome-
non almost makes it worth the
wait). , —

Based on a true story, the
movie takes place in 1960
aboard an Ocean Academy
brigantine called the Albatross.
During a long year at sea, a
group of teenage boys fight,
joke and bond with each other
as they learn the importance
of friendship, teamwork and so
on. This process takes up abit
more time in the film than it
needs to, although it does
deliver a few endearing —
albeit rather generic
moments.

The big payoff, of course, is
the massive “white squall” into
which the Albatross lunges,
and it is at this point that direc-
tor Flidley Scott (Alien, Blade

  
  

 
 
  

Runner, Thelma & Louise)
redeems himself. This cata-
strophic sequence is true
edge-of-your-seat material: a
wild, violent battle with nature

‘that can only be truly enjoyed

on the big screen. Its after-
math, in which skipper
Christopher Sheldon (Jeff
Bridges) is brought to trial, is
just as commanding, but that's
mostly due to Bridges. The
lines he’s given are nothing
new, but Sheldon’s burdened
soul is clearly visible through
Bridges’ portrayal of the man:
a strong-willed hard-ass who
must come to terms withthe
deathly debacle at sea.

Among the teens along for
the ride, Scott Wolf (TV’s Party
of Five) stands out the most.
True, his character, Chuck
Gieg, is the film’s narrator, but
Wo|f’s portrayal is a very effec-
tive one. White Squall is a
rather satisfying piece of
entertainment although not
wholly original or entirely
enjoyable.

Goaltending, power play, prope

 

Connie Nigro
Staff Writer

Third period power—p1ay goals propelled IUP to a
come-from—behind 5-3 victory over an injury-
plagued Pitt Panther hockey team Saturday at Neville
Ice Rink in South Side.

Ryan Kelvington’s garne-winning power-play goal
with 5:16 left in the third period gave IUP a 4-3 lead
for the first time that night. Kelvington also beat Pitt
goalie Jeff Haduch 10 seconds earlier to tie the game
3-3, after being down 3-1 going into the third.

IUP’s Dan Hestin also scored two goals on
Haduch. Hestin opened the Indians’ scoring with
2:29 left in the first period. He scored IUP’s final
goal to secure a victory with only 36 seconds left in
regulation.

The loss drops Pitt’s record to 8-3-1, 7-1 in their
division.

The Panthers’ three goals were scored in the first
two periods by Chris Bickel, Dan Woodbury and
Ryan Moore. IUP held Pitt scoreless in the third peri-
od. ‘

The Panthers were forced to make some line
adjustments for the game due to injuries. Pitt’s entire
first-line offense was out of the game.

“It was poor playing, but it’s not everybody’s

fault,” team captain Matt White said. “People are
playing with new line-mates and everyone was
banged up from the night before.”

Among the injured are Bill Elliott, Pitt’s leading
scorer, who’s out indefinitely after suffering a knee
injury two weeks ago against Duquesne. Brad Rizzo,
a major goal-scorer, missed the game after receiving
stitches. Brad McMullin is out for another two to
three weeks with a blown MCL. Bickel left
Saturday’s game to get stitches and White missed the
entire second period with a knee injury, but returned
for the third period.

Not only are the Panthers plagued with injuries,
they’re plagued with penalties as well. IUP’s come-
back goals were on the power play in the third peri-
od.

“IUP got to a point of ridiculousness and the refs
wouldn’t call penalties on them,” White said. “Most
stupid penalties are from retaliation.”

Panther Head Coach Dick Rizzo has given up on
pressing the penalty issue.

“It’s like a joke in the locker room,” Rizzo said.
“Whether I say it or not, we’re gonna get penalties. I
just told them if you’re gonna get penalties, make it a
good one. Get your two minutes’ worth.”

At 14:31 of the first period Hestin opened the
scoring, giving IUP a 1-0 lead. Twenty-one seconds

. i 7
Is IUP over Pitt hockey, 5-3

later, Pitt answered the Indian’s goal as Bickel beat
the IUP goalie to tie the game at l.

Pitt had a two-man advantage at the beginning of
the second period, but failed to score. Pitt struck ﬁrst
two minutes into the second period on a goal by
Woodbury to go up 2-1. ’

Eleven minutes -later, a Moore goal put Pitt up 3-1. ,

Just as the second period belonged to Pitt, IUP
owned the third period. IUP came out scoring and got
four unanswered goals in the third period. Early in S
the third, Jeff Ohmer scored a power-play goal to
make it a one-goal deficit for the Indians.

Just over three minutes later, Kelvington scored on
the power play to tie the game at 3-3 and set up his
game-winner.

Pitt had the opportunity to tie up the game as they
got a power play with 3:30 left in the game, but they
couldn’t capitalize. Moore also applied the pressure
with a solo-effort scoring chance that was stiﬂed by
the IUP goalie.

Any chances of a Pitt comeback were gone as
Hestin scored his second goal of the game with just
36 seconds left-in regulation.

“We just didn’t play as a team,” Rizzo said. “This ‘
game wasn’t too important, but the CMU game is.
We need to win by two goals to pull ahead in the
division.”

“When playing powerful players like that, it’s an educa-
tion,” Willard said. “It’s painful one.”

Hill hit a 4-footer on a break and then Wallace broke
through the lane, scoring on a finger roll at 12:41 to give the
Orangemen a 17-8 lead.

Those baskets came in the middle of a 14-4 Syracuse run
over a seven-minute stretch. Jerry McCullough stopped the
game from getting out of hand, finding an open Michael Gill
underneath for a dunk which cut the Orangemen’s lead to
25-14 with 6:15 left in the half.

It also started a 6-0 Panther run, until‘ Wallace and Hill
stopped any threat of a comeback. The two combined to
score Syracuse’s next 12 points, and carried the Orangemen
into halftime leading 37-24.

“Hill and Wallace were really looking for each other in the
first half,” Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim said. “That’s prob-
ably the best they’ve played together this year.”

Their presence under the glass was also prevalent from a
rebounding standpoint. The Orangemen outrebounded Pitt
44-31 in the game.

After only scoring six points in the first half, Varga came
alive in the second half for Pitt, scoring nine .of the
Panthers’ first 12 points of the half. Along with his 26
points he grabbed nine rebounds, one shy of his third-
straight double-double. .

Varga’s offensive outburst in the second ignited a new
intensity as the Panthers threw man-to-man strategy into its

bag of defensive tricks.

This caused Syracuse’s guards to handle and shoot the ball
more. Point guard Lazarus Sims finished with nine points,
all in the second half, and eight assists. Todd Burgan fin-
ished with lO points, scoring five in the second half.

“The second half we didn’t play with the same intensity,”
Boeheim said. “We need to be more consistent in the back-
court. The inside guys ‘have been there all year.”

Pitt worked its way back to a five—point deficit at the
14:36 mark after McCullough picked up a steal from Jason
Cipolla and went in for an open layup. McCullough finished
the game with only eight points, shooting 2-of-13 from the
field.

Wallace answered on the other end, driving through the
lane for a monster slam, giving Syracuse a 48-41 lead.

The Orangemen then worked back out to a double-digit
lead, until Pittwhit another run that eventually fell short.

Down 11 with 7:03 left, Garrick Thomas, who finished
with 13 points, hit a 3-pointer and Vonteego Cummings
came back for Pitt with a 12-footer, cutting the lead to 61-
55. .

After Sims hit two free throws, Varga drew a foul from
Hill. Varga hit both shots, pulling Pitt within five. Then
Gerald Jordan hit a foul shot of his own, making it 63-59
with 4:47 left to play.

But, as it did against Massachusetts and Connecticut, the
Panthers didn’t come up with the big plays when it counted
most — in the last five minutes.

“The talent difference is not that big,” Varga said. “It
comes down to confidence and, the last five minutes inthis
league.”

“Their crowd was getting
into it, and I wanted to shut
them up a little bit,” Wallace
said as he tinkered with his
walkman in the Syracuse
locker room. “What better
way to shut up a crowd than
with a monstrous dunk.”

Good point. The only other
way is to follow up that dunk
with some more yolk. After
that slam, Wallace kissed a ‘
pretty turnaround jumper off
the glass and then split a pair
of free throws on the next
possession.

But it wasn’t just Wallace
who tore apart Pitt’s front-
court. Hill, a 6-8 center,
scored 18 of his 21 points in
the first half. Hill also fin-
ished with 10 rebounds.

To give a proper gauge on
how bad Wallace and Hill
butchered Pitt, the two com-
bined to outscore the
Panthers by six at halftime,
with one less rebound than
the whole Pitt team. For the
game, they finished with 10
less total boards than Pitt and
shot a combined 50 percent
from the field. '

Wallace even tied Pitt’s
leading assist man with
three. Needless to say,
Wallace made a good deci-
sion to play out his senior
year. Averaging 22.4 points
and 8.8 rebounds a game, A
Wallace is sure to jump up to
Syracuse’s second all-time

leading scorer before the sea- ,

son is through. Take a guess
who is second. 5

Wrestling

°From page 6
Pat Wiltanger (ninth at heavy-
weight) for Pitt.
Both teams are undefeated in

the Eastern Wrestling League’

(pending the outcome of
Clarion’s ‘match ‘ against
Edinboro tonight). Thewinner

will remain at the top of the ‘

standings.

For Pitt Assistant Coach Dan
Payne, there is more-than that at
stake. Payne was an All-
American heavyweight wrestler
at Clarion, and he has been look-
ing forward to facing his old
teammates and friends for a long
time.

“From right when I took this
job, people wanted to know how
I would react,” Payne said.
“Some of the best friends I’ve
made in my life are on that team.
You want to look good against
them. It would be so sweet to
beat them.”

Having been on the same
team as many of Clarion’s cur-
rent wrestlers, Payne knows
some inside information, and
he’s not afraid to share it with
his new team.

“Those guys would be foolish
to think I won’t tell these guys
about it. That’s part of the
trade,” Payne said. “But the bot-
tom line is «whoever wants it
worse will win.” V

As a service to our
readers, here is a brief
guide to wine choice,
offered by Phil Domski, an
eight—year faculty instruc-
tor in wines and mixology
at the Pennsylvania A
Institute of Culinary Arts.

Domski said the first
consideration when choos-
ingwine for a meal is the
cooking method for the
entree."

“Some cooking tech-
niques, like broiling or bak-
ing, produce a lighter
effect,” Domski said. “By
contrast, grilled or fried
will have a heavier effect.”
In the same way, wine can
be light or heavy.

White wines can

either be dry or sweet, and

within each of these orders"
are light, medium and
heavy wines.

T Red wines are simi-
larly categorized.

Domski said textures
and sauces of foods are just
as importantin choosing.
the most palatable vintage.

~“Lighterland white
sauces will take a lighter-
bodied white wine,” he said.
“Red sauces should be
accompanied by heavier
and more full-bodied wine.’

Choosing wine mir-
rors life: finding a ‘balance
is the key to contentment.

word,” he said. Diners
should strive to match the
weight of the wine to the
weight of the meal.

I For a variety of
meals, Domski suggested
the following wines:

Porterhouse steak:
“Red burgundy or a
California Cabernet
Sauvignon.~”

Grilled salmon: “White
burgundy or a California
Chardonnay.”

Cajun or jerk chicken:'
“The more you increase the
pepper or the spice, the
more difficult it becomes to
find a good choice of wine.
The more you turn up the
heat, so to speak, the more
the food can overpower the
subtlety of the wine.”

Red pasta sauces:
“Chianti or Zinfandel will
cover 95 percent of red
saucesf’ _

White pasta sauces:
“For something like
Fettucini Alfredo a dry,
crisp white wine, [such as]
French Chablis or Orvieto
(an Italian wine).”

For dessert wines,
Domski said, “As a rule,
drier wines work better
than sweeter wines.”

He said dishes with
fruit, like an apple tart, or
cheesecake are desserts in
