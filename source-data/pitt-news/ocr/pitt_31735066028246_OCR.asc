That’s one reason why Boyd
says student gambling is at the

for the police department.

“Unless the student is run-

not breaking any laws,” he
says. “The vast majority of stu-

Mini-station enhances community safety

By Jackie Duggan
Asst. News Editor

Sitting in the mini station
last week, Pitt Police officers
watched as two different men
tried. to guzzle down forties
of beer while waiting for
their bus. Immediately the
individuals were cited and
the beer confiscated.

This is just one advantage.
of opening a satellite mini
police station on Forbes

Avenue and Bouquet Street.
“We are trying to make
sure everyone is keenly
aware of the police presence
on campus,” said Rick Boyd,
Pitt police chief. “Already
we have had a significant

number of students stop and

say it makes them feel good.”

The station is on a highly
visible and busy section of
Forbes Avenue —- diagonally
across the street from the
Original Hot Dog Shop.

Boyd feels the station will be
useful for crime prevention
and other practical reasons.

“It will be a positive influ-
ence in that vicinity,” Boyd
said. “It is known as a mas-
sive gathering place for peo-
ple in general.”

The office also serves as a
central location where offi-
cers can write reports and
citations rather than go to the
main station under Forbes
Quad.

In addition, Pitt Police are
making use of a building that
otherwise would have been
unoccupied.

mally occupies the office

exhibits until April. A

Family work ethic influence administrator

Leon Haley, vice chancellor for student and public

affairs relaxes in his office.

 

By Julian Neiser
Senior Suﬁ‘ Writer

When Leon Haley became the first person in his family of 12
brothers and sisters to graduate college, he didn’t succeed because

he simply wanted _to.

And when he was drafted in 1956, during the first year of his
master’s degree, he could have stayed in school to avoid service. _

But he didn’t.

The 62-year-old Homewood native was always expected to do
the right thing, and he usually did.

Despite his education and experience as Pitt’s vice chancellor for
student and public affairs, Haley says the way he conducts busi-
ness is a direct reﬂection of the traditionally strict and positive

upbringing by his parents.

“In my family we all knew life was a struggle,” Haley said, sit-
ting next to his Phi Eta Sigma honor society certificate. “All
around you there. were poor people, and the only way out was to
work hard and keep your mind clear.”

Growing up, Haley said his influence was the 10
Commandments and his family’s work ethic.

In 1951, while supporting a large family of brothers and sisters,

Haley’s father managed to ﬁnance his son’s college education.
After 35 years of service to the same company, Haley’s father was
given an award for never missing a day of work.

“How could I see something like that and not work hard
myse .” Haley said. “This is what we saw every day in my house,
and that’s what I remembered when I was on my own.”

After graduating cum laude in 1955 with a degree in political
science, Haley worked through the summer as a busboy and head-

Colin Powell related to British royal family

% World Events

LONDON — Ties dating back
200 years show potential presi-
dential candidate Colin Powell is
a relative of Queen Elizabeth H
and every other royal family in
Europe.

His link to the crown dates
back to when the British gover-
nor of Jamaica impregnated a
slave named Sally around 1800,
according to Burke’s Peerage, a
blue-blood family tree that
researches royal families and all
presidential candidates.

The director of publishing for
Burke’s says that if Powell does
decide to take a run for the presi-
dency, he may have fate on his
side because in every presiden-
tial election since George
Washington, the victor has
always been the one who has the
greatest number of ties to the

New Hope improves conditions in El Salvador

By Beth ML Laughlin
For The Pitt News

Hope brought a 17-year-old to Pittsburgh.

Marvin Ulises Morales Martinez doesn’t speak
English. He is a shy boy from Nueva Esperanza, El
Salvador. He has come to America to learn how to run
the complex water ﬁltering system in his village.

New Hope is the Pittsburgh organization that
helped get him here. They have been helping
Morales’ village with fundraisers and expeditions to
El Salvador for three years. Bernie Colligan, coordi-
nator of New Hope, was on the first trip to El
Salvador in 1992.

“It was a village of mostly tents, and we went down
to help them build houses,” Colligan told a journalism
class at Pitt last month.

Except there was a mix-up and no supplies were
there. Instead, the people on the expedition ﬁnished a
bakery that had been started but never completed.

This was also when the organization noticed the
water people were using. It was unclean and con-
tained animal excrement. Bill Keller. one member of

gested installing one in Nueva Esperanza. It took time
because there was another mix-up, and the well the
villagers dug was two inches too small in diameter.
After a new well was dug, the plans were set.

That’s where Morales comes in. Once the funds
were set, the village held a meeting and asked for vol-
unteers to run the water system. Morales and two oth-
ers were interested. Morales was chosen because the
others could not go to Colorado for two weeks.

“Before, the water was contaminated and people
were getting sick,” said Morales, with the help of a
translator.

Now the 450 people of Nueva Esperanza can travel
to the water tower in the center of the village and get
clean water. Morales, along with another person, will
run the system as their village job, while the other vil-
lagers work with their corn, rice and sesame crops.

Nueva Esperanza was founded on March 21, 1991.
It is made up of former refugees who ﬂed the country
during its civil war. The group had originally settled
in another place.

“The place was too rocky, not good for crops,”
Morales said. “People were sent to look for a better
place.” ‘

The village now has houses and a middle school.
The conditions have improved. and New Hope has
been asked to help sister villages in El Salvador and is
working on other projects.

“Now we are raising money for a school bus."
Colligan said.

New Hope is made up of a diverse group of volun-
teers ranging from lawyers and constructors to Mayor
Tom Murphy, one of the founders.

“Right now [Murphy] plays a low-key role in the
group,” said Colligan, “but he helps us out with things
like the roast.”

New Hope held a roast with Murphy as the roastee,
which means he was the brunt of all the jokes they
told that evening. According to Colligan, they sold
about 80 tickets at $50 each. Other fundraisers include
concerts, private donations and a mailing list of 400
friends of New Hope, including some Pitt alumni.

“If we think a certain organization would be inter-
ested in helping a certain project. we ask them for
donations,” Colligan said.

As Morales boarded his plane Monday for his flight
home, he could thank USAir for donating his ticket
and New Hope for caring.

Haley

°Fr0m page I
ednorth to Boston College in pursuit of a
master’s in government

But only one year into hisvstudy, an
important letter came in the mail. .

“I was drafted in 1956,” Haley said.
“All the Haley men had been in the rrrii? »
tary, and now it was my turn.” .

Two years of service with the Army sig-
nal corps took him all over the United
States and to Tokyo. After that, Haley
unsuccessfully applied to the U.S. foreign
service.

Haley started looking for a political sci-
ence teaching job, but in the late 1950s,
few universities were hiring African-
American teachers.

“I really wanted to be a foreign ambas-
sador and work in an embassy,” Haley
says. “I don’t know why they turned me
down, and though I was qualiﬁed, the uni-
versities weren't hiring me either.”

During this time, a friend of his became

African—American school in Texas. As
fate would have it, they needed a political
science professor.

Haley remembered one student who he
took under his wing at Wiley. The student
was from Jackson, ‘Miss., and had a poor
educational background.

The student went on to earn his master’s
degree and Haley was asked to be the
godfather of the student’s child.

“That was such an honor for me to help
with his education and then to be the god-

. father of his child,” said Haley.

In the early 1960s, he came back to the
Pitt in pursuit of a doctorate. ’

He wrote a dissertation about housing
problems that were plaguing the urban
areas of large cities. Haley compared
urban housing in Pennsylvania to New
York's. .

His dissertation adviser was Ray Owen,
who teaches political science at Pitt. After

‘30 years, Owen still remembers Haley’s

dissertation.

“This was a well-written, timely paper
that was a huge issue at the time,” said
Owen. “Though itis impossible to mea-
sure immediate impact. I’m sure some
legislators were inﬂuenced by his find-
ings.”

Owen remembers Haley as an extreme-
ly mature academic student with a strong
sense of moral values and organization.
Owen called him a “gentleman” as well as
an excellent student.

John Funary, Rhodes scholar and dean
of GSPIA from 1974 to 1984, worked
with Haley.

“We had an extraordinary trust,” Funary
said. “He was a fantastic teacher that was
thought to be eminently fair by the white
students, and depended upon by the black
students.” "

Funary said the early ‘70s was a racially
charged time on most college campuses,
and conﬂicts between blacks and whites
could be openly tense and violent.

He said one white faculty member once

referred to Haley’s position as associate
dean as a “hankey head," a derogatory
comment made in reference to headgear
worn by black ﬁeld workers in the South.

Funary said Haley went on to control
the situation with mental force, correcting
the situation by confronting the faculty
member and ensuring the incident
wouldn’t happen again.

“I went off like a rocket,” Funary said.
“He had to restrain me on the grounds that
it would dignify the racist comment. He
was right, and the way he handled that
faculty member was a lesson to us all.”

As he reﬂected on his life experiences.
Haley pondered the problems that face
today’s youths. He said that there is an
obligation to respect others because we all
have fundamental rights as people.

“There are fundamental core values that
deﬁne us as a community,” Haley said. “If
we don’t enforce this. what is there to sep-
arate us from being a pack of animals,
devouring ourselves?”

And this destruction could
take years of slow gambling

Opinions

Give yourself a raise

The land of opportunity  that’s America. Nowhere else in the
world can you enjoy the freedoms and opportunities you can enjoy
in this country. But there are some groups of people in this country
who enjoy even more opportunity than most of us.

How many of you have been in this situation? You’ve only been
working at your present job for a little while, maybe a year or two.

‘The cost of living is skyrocketing around you, and interest rates are
soaring. Your boss doesn’t quite understand that, and you haven’t
seen a pay raise since you started working. -

Well, if your boss. is the people of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and your job is that of a legislator, you can solve your
problem in an instant. Just vote yourself a pay increase.

That is exactly what a committee of six Pennsylvania legislators
did Monday night. The vote, if it is signed into law, will raise legis-
lators’ salaries from $47,000 to $55,800. A quick computation
shows that this is not just any pay increase: it is an 18-percent
increase. The committee also voted substantial increases for the
governor, attorney general, auditor general, treasurer, lieutenant

‘ governor, cabinet members, judges and district justices.

The legislators who voted for these increases have taken great lib-
erties with the power they were given when they were elected. In
the real world of working for a living, it is hard enough to get a pay
raise of any kind. An 18-percent increase is something few of us
will ever see (unless we run for office.) It is unlikely our bosses are
going to let any of us choose our next pay raises. Perhaps the legis-

lature should ask its bosses (the people of Pennsylvania) if they

deserve the raise they so graciously gave themselves.

Take it all off,baby!

Take it all off, baby! That is exactly what they are doing at the
new Club Erotica on Route 51 in Rostraver. And a lot of people are
not too happy. Residents and officials of Rostraver have been peti-
tioning the courts to order the club to close, but have not been too
successful yet.

Good.

The people who are trying to close the club’s doors are standing
on their holier-than-thou pedestals, dictating the morality to which
you should adhere. (Hmm  now how would those people know
what went on inside this kind of club unless they had been in one?)

Yes, Club Erotica features nude dancers. Pennsylvania law dic-
tates, however, that alcoholic beverages cannot be sold in establish-
ments which feature all—nude dancers. Club Erotica has not violated
that law. I _

Yes, Club Erotica is not somewhere you would go for a quiet
night out with your new girlfriend or mother-in-law. But it provides
a relatively harmless means of entertainment for anyone who
chooses to go there. The dancers there choose to do what they do,
and the people who patronize the club chosse to go there. No one
held 'a gun to anyone’s head and forced the dancers to take it all off.

The point is that people have a right to entertain themselves how-
ever they choose. Club Erotica provides a form of entertainment
which is hardly different from what you can see on cable television.
If you don’t want to see it, change the channel. If you don’t want to

, see it, don’t go to the club. But keep your morality to yourself.

Matt reintroduced
Mills ‘O the

___._,_.__._ nuclear pro-
liferation controversy. The
big-"hearted members of the
media were horrified that a
civilized country such as the
United States would cause
such destruction. Let me take
this opportunity to say that
anyone getting teary-eyed
about Hiroshima should be
deported. War is supposed to
be about destruction, and we
perfected the art. Besides,
they started it. ’

Some have argued that we

should have fought Japan in a
more “humane” fashion. A
conventional invasion would
have cost an estimated 1 mil-
lion U.S. lives. Anyone
favoring that method is obvi-
ously anti-American.

Having gottenthat off my
chest, let’s take a look at the
benefits that nuclear weapons
have brought us. In addition
topthe hundreds of thousands
of lives that nuclear war
saved in World War II, it has
saved even more since. It is
not a coincidence that there
has not been a world war
since 1945. It’s a concept
called deterrence. If, for
instance, the old Soviet
Union had wanted to attack
their evil capitalist enemy,
they were deterred by the fact
that we could have created a
mushroom cloud in Moscow,
Kiev, Leningrad and
Stalingrad all at once. Thus,
nuclear capabilities have cre-
ated a measure of peace
among the great powers of
the world.

There are also less obvious
benefits fromour nuclear

capabilities; Less than a
dozen countries have nuclear
arsenals. Because building a
nuclear threat is costly, many
smaller nations have
improved their relations with
countries such as the United
States in order to be protect-
ed. Two such nations are
South Korea and Taiwan.
They both have security con-
cerns due to the presence of
China, but neither has
acquired nuclear weapons
because it would have dam-
aged relations with the
United States.

Some people still hold on to
a dream of a demilitarized
world. They argue that when
countries have weapons, they
use them. This is only some-
times true. Switzerland, for
instance, has maintained a
strong military and neutrality
for decades. So unfortunately,
not everyone wants to get
together and put flowers in
their hair and smoke weed.
Countries (and people, for
that matter) have always
hated other countries. The
United States is the prime
recipient of such hatred. Even
our friendly neighbors to the
north hate us. So, given the
fact that the whole world
hates, us (even the countries
we pour money into), why
should we feel sorry for our
military might?

I have heard arguments that
since the “Cold War is over,”
there is no longer a need for
nuclear weapons. This might
sound strange, but who said it
ended anyway? Was it with
the fall of the Berlin Wall?
Was it when Gorbechev was
given a Nobel Peace Prize?
Or was it when the Soviet
Union split up? If we have
won the Cold War, then why
don’t we have a “Victory over
the Cold War Day” on our
calendar? The fact is, if
Russia is no longer commu-
nist, it is also not far removed
from it. And it certainly still

has a potent nuclear arsenal.
The Russians are not even the
greatest of our military con-
cerns these days. Come to
think of it, we would be bet-
ter off if they were. The
Soviets were more rational
than the Islamic dictators and
terrorist groups that we face
today.

We have long been con-
cerned about lesser countries
getting nuclear weapons. The
United Nations. in the
process of trying to feel
important, has been keeping a
close eye on nations like Iraq
and North Korea. Four other
countries — Israel, South
Africa, India and Pakistan -
are capable of becoming a
threat within weeks. You may
be thinking, “First he acted
like he was in love with
nuclear weapons, and now he
seems worried.” To a certain
extent, this may be true.
However, there are a few rea-
sons to be glad that nuclear
arsenals still exist. First of
all, the concept of deterrence
will continue to exist among
powerful nations. And even if
countries like Iraq had
nuclear capabilities. they still
might not kill any more peo-
ple than they do now. In addi-
tion, nuclear proliferation by

such countries might yield a

response in kind from a
stronger nation. thus'extend-
ing the concept of deterrence
globally.

So regardless of your politi-
cal leaning, we should all be
thankful for the invention of
nuclear weapons. Let’s go
ahead and print some mush-
room-cloud stamps, bronze
the Enola Gay and put it in
the Smithsonian and celebrate
Aug. 6 every year. For any-
one horrified by that notion.
keep in mind that we have
most likely saved millions of
lives because of nuclear pro-
liferation.

 » ~ » 1 a family, the edu-
Evan cational system
Gallahou is failing our
__________ children and a
general paucity of ethics and
values, has encompassed our
society. While America’s
weapons and money keep it
firmly entrenched on the world
stage. there are few American
leaders left to guide Americans
on a path of goodness and
decency. American heroes with

- whom our children can relate

are fading quickly.

Real heroes give Americans
something to dream about. We
can emulate their actions, thus
giving, our lives guidance and
meaning. We can live our unat-

tainable dreams through their

wondrous lives. They give us
inspiration. In our attempts to
emulate them, we push our-
selves beyond a limit where
we’d normally concede defeat.
We attempt things that, to the
uninspired, seem foolish. We
contort our tight, uncoordinated
bodies in twisted ‘shapes so we
can “Be like Mike.” We push
ourselves because we know it’s
within the limits of human
endurance. Our role models, our

heroes, have made that clear to
us.

Mickey Mantle was a true
role model. The Oklahoma boy,
with blonde hair, muscular build
and musical Southern accent
was the man who replaced Joe
DiMaggio as the Yankee center
fielder. He was a mythical figure
who ran like Mercury and hit
mammoth home runs like Babe
Ruth. Before people wanted to
be like Mike, they wanted to be
like Mick. They wanted to talk
and hit like him. Billy Crystal
joked that he was the only kid in
Brooklyn I who had an
Oklahoma accent at his bar
mitzvah. Many children display-
ing na‘1've affection and loyalty
actually limped like him, copy-
ing his famous home run trot,
tainted after numerous knee and
leg operations. Mick had that
effect. .

But it wasn’t his hitting or
running that made -Mantle
famous. The Mick was a class A
drinker. Hell, hitting a baseball
is extremely difficult, and only a
few kids can actually make the
big leagues, so"why pursue it?
However, anyone can drink.
And no one drank better than
Mickey. He and Billy Martin
(who died in a drunk driving
accident in 1990) were known
to indulge and indulge.

It takes time to build up a tol-
erance to alcohol that one can be
proud of. The Mick pushed
thousands of kids to their limit

(Thefollowing is aﬂyer which was placed in campus mail

boxes recently.)

AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MY PEOPLE ,

A body in motion tends to stay in motion; a body at rest

_ tends to stay at rest. The Black community has not performed

a mass movement in 30 years. Nor triumphed collectively in
30 years. The time has come for new approaches,inew
philosophies and innovative, uncompromising solutions to the
problems we face.

I am calling to your attention “The Million Man March,”
held in Washington on Oct. 16, 1995. It comes down to this:
If America chooses to wage war, then we must send our sol-
diers to the front line, and we must work collectively in this
effort. " A

I ask my brothers if you have not already decided to go,
consider this: When will you decide to remove the foot off of
your neck? Has it become so much a part of your person you

can no longer feel the pain? Seize the opportunity! Accept‘

your responsibility! And join your brothers in a march that
will affect our existence in America.
To my sisters: The issues that are being addressed are also

. your issues. The strong Black man you desire and the respon-

sible Black man you ask for isthe frame of this march.‘ It is a
positive step against injustice for the Black man as well as the

 Black woman. An all-man march is the effort toward accept-

ing their role in the Black community. And showing the rest
of the world that our Black men are strong and responsible
individuals; not the shiftless, lazy, criminal images mass
media puts forth. V _ « ’

What can you do to show support?? As men are petitioning

‘ - the issues that affect all of us, women are asked to stay home

from work, school, stores and anyother places of business (if,
as a« man, you do not participate, then please do the same).
REMEMBER:.Demonstrating our collective will can have a
deleterious effect on" this nation. Please support it and help
resurrect the Black Community.
A Thank You. '

as drinkers. He was the inspira-
tion that made the kid about to
vomit from alcohol then drink
two or three more beers before
he collapsed on the bathroom
floor. By playing baseball hung
over, he inspired millions to put
on their suits and ties and go to
work hung over, or downright
drunk. So, through headaches
and nausea, Americans gave it
that extra effort —— even if that
extra effort meant getting sick
on the bus, or in the office. If
Mickey could wrap his legs in
bandages, throw up and then hit
a home run, then anyone could
sit in an office chair all day.
Mickey deserves credit for
bringing the most out of his
fans. ’
Jerry Garcia is another man
whose recent death saddened
the nation. Without Garcia, the
world has one less role model,
and one less ice cream ﬂavor to
guide them through their trying
hours. Jerry proved that despite
being only a fair singer, his
songwriting abilities could
touch people so deeply that
they’d follow him around the
country for years. His band was
not just a favorite group for the
millions of Deadheads; rather, it
was a religion. John Lennon
once claimed that the Beatles
were bigger than Jesus, and per-
haps he was right, but, the
Grateful Dead were not bigger,
they were other. They were an
entirely new religion, conceived

Dear Ms. Manasseh,

I am concerned; I am very
concerned! I came across your
piece entitled “An
Announcement to my People,”
and I was struck with sheer
dread! I was amazed that

something like this can be pro-'

duced by someone in an acad-
emic environment. I write to
you now in an appeal, to recon-
sider the language you chose
to use. ‘

My questions for you are
these: Am I not your “brother”
because I happen to have skin
pigmentation that appears
“white” —— though it is more
pink or red? Am I not your

“brother” though my grandfa-'

ther comes from Africa? (I
would like to point out that he
was a “pied-noir” and has suf-
fered more oppression than
most of us know.) Am I not
your “brother” ‘by the sole fact
that we reside on the same
planet, and should you not also
be calling for my support —
maybe even more so than
other “African-Americans” —
in this crusade of yours? When
one human being “suffers” do
we not all “suffer collective-
ly?” (I call to your attention
the Oklahoma bombing.) Do
all Black women “desire
strong Black men” or do some

__ desire other Black women? Is

there no room in your scheme
for “altemative” lifestyles?
Ms. Manasseh, though I am

in San Francisco, and confirmed

around the world. They were a,

religion of tie-dyes and peace.
Each concert was a baptism of
music, which converted many,
enthralled many more. Their
followers were wanderers in the
American desert, lost souls who
found themselves willingly
trapped within the blues/rock
wailings of the Dead.

Despite the amazing music
that marked Garcia’s life, he
won’t be remembered for his
fluency of major and minor
chords. Nor will he be remem-
bered for “Uncle John’s Band”
or “Truckin’.” No, Garcia will
be remembered as a man who
took an extraordinary amount of
drugs, ate like a pig and still
managed to tour the country for
25 years. What a message for
second and third generation
Dead Heads! If one ‘sniffs,
smokes or drops chemicals for
30 years, one can still lead a
productive life. This is a great
message to send to teenagers
around the world. It’s a message

.of hope. No matter how many

drugs they’re taking, they know
they could probably take more

and still live to the ripe old age’

of 52! In a'.world where crime
and disease challenge people’s
hope of immortality, Jerry
Garcia brought a positive mes-
sage, otherwise absent, into the
minds of America’s youth.
Furthermore, in a world which
worships the magazine pullout,

Your people, my people... what about our

white (an Italian-French-
African-American), I have
won a writing competition on
“Cultural Awareness,” I am a
graduate student in Religious
Studies (focusing on Chinese
religions) and I feel I am
rather sensitive to humanity’s
needs. Indeed it is because of
humanity’s needs that I decid-
ed to study “other” peoples’
religions. It is solely on these
terms that I base any credibili-
ty that I may have with you
and on this I would like to

suggest the following:
If you continue to refer to
“African—Americans” as

“your” people and not “our”
people, then youautomatically
set up a barrier between
“your” people and the rest of
the world. The role in which
you place women in your
piece sets them back 30 years;
it makes women subservient to
men. The very language and
tone that you use perpetuates
and contributes to a “white”
person’s feelings of alienation
from the “African-American”
individual.

, Though I would never sug-
gest that a “white”pperson can
understand what it means to be
“Black” (I also believe that
one person cannot know what
it means to be another);
though I would never suggest
that there are not bigots in this

' world, I will, and do, suggest

that your tone aids in perpetu-

where thin and in shape is chic

the non-model type. He’s an
inspiration to all middle—aged,
drug—dependent men. 150
pounds overweight. His popu-
larity lets them feel good about
themselves. while his death at
such an old age tells them to
stay the course and enjoy life to

America has lost two of its

Through these superstars,
Americans hit home runs in

ever, they proved that it’s possi-
ble to work through adversity,
no matter how bad the hang-
over, or how pure the cocaine. I
can think of no better message
to send our youth. If Jerry
Garcia could move his fat, thick
fingers over the guitar while
seeing small, green dragons
jumping at him from some dark
comer of his mind, or if Mickey
Mantle could hit a baseball into
the stands despite seeing three
balls thrown at him, then any-

one can accomplish anything if-

they put their mind to their
objective. America’s youth will
be hard pressed to find role
models with the same message
that Mantle and Garcia took to
their graves.

hit the fan at
Saturday's Midnight Madness
adventure.

Coach Ralph VV1llard and his
much-heralded men’s hoops
squad got around 20 minutes of
exposure — shooting threes,
slarmning and taking lay-ups ——
having a grand old time.

Coach Kirk Bruce and his
women’s team got about four
seconds of exposure, and that
was with the lights out.

I don’t believe men’s and
women’s basketball are equal in
level of skill, and obviously, they
are far from equal as far as the
cash register is concerned.

— But here is where Pitt opens
its mouth and spits out a bunch
of hypocritical rhetoric.

It drops two men’s sports and
adds a women’s sport, in the
interests of equality and playing
by the rules. What it really did
was create a facade in which
men’s and women’s sports are
equal. Maybe they are, if you
exclude football and basketball. ‘

As a member of the local
media, I had the privilege of
attending some meetings where
around 20 people discussed
plans for Midnight Madness.

At one meeting, coach Bruce
basically pleaded for his team to
get an opportunity to at least run
some drills.

It didn’t happen. And the Pitt
athletic department proved while
it can be politically correct, it
isclueless when it comes to
doing what’s right.

Over 6,000 people packed the
Field House for Midnight
Madness, the largest crowd ever
for the event here. A perfect
opportunity was set to show a lot
of people what the women’s
team could do.

Nope. All we saw was two
Lady Panthers in a shooting con-
test. _ V

The real problem here is the
athletic department preaches
equality, but the bottom line is
whatever the men’s basketball
team and the football team want,
they get.

I know women’s hoops will
likely never reach the popularity
that men’s has at this school, but
it doesn’t even have a ﬁghting
chance if Pitt continues to treat it
as second class.

Stajf Writer

The Pitt soccer team kept its three-game
winning streak alive by defeating Carnegie
Mellon 3-1. The Panthers canied the momen-
tum from Friday’s huge upset over Rutgers
into Tuesday’s game.

The Panthers picked up right where they left
off. From the opening minutes of the game,
the Panthers posed an offensive threat by
immediately challenging the CMU goalie.
The CMU fans in attendance at Gesling
Stadium were silenced by Pitt’s immediate
attack

The only sounds resembling cheering came
from a group of youngsters who lined the
sidelines and shouted “CMU” when they felt
daring enough. Considering that the game was
scoreless for the ﬁrst half, neither CMU nor
Pitt fans in attendance had much to cheer
about.

Despite a scoreless ﬁrst half, Pitt did man-
age some pretty passing plays in front of the
ClVIU net Senior midﬁelder Jeff Porter tested
CMU goalie by putting a shot right on goal,
but it went off the hand of the Tartans’ goalie
and sailed over the net.

Pitt had another great scoring chance, but
once again it was the hand of the CMU goalie
in the way of a Pitt goal. The ﬁrst half of the
game was mostly played inthe CMU end of

the ﬁeld as Pitt kept the pressure on.

Although the scoring chances were there,
the goals were not. Despite Pitt’s offensive
attack, coach Luxbacher was still disappointed
in the Panthers’ ﬁrst—half play.

“We didn’t play well as a group,” said

. Luxbacher. “The effort was disappointing.”

Rugby loses to Slippery Rock, but is appealing

The second half started the same as the ﬁrst:
Pitt had all the scoring opportunities. The only
dilference was that the Panthers ﬁnally cashed
in on a goal three minutes intothe game. At
42:04 Pitt scored on a head shot. The play
started by Pitt having a comer kick. The kick
went off a Pitt player’s head, onto another and
ﬁnally into the net for the score.

The Tartans refused to give up. Down by a

goal, ClVIU picked it up a notch. Ten minutes
later, with a lot of confusion in front of Pitt
goalie Adam Spitzer, CMU managed to score.
The ball was rnisheaded by a Pitt player in
front of Spitzer and ended up behind him and
in the net

With the goal, the Tartans gained the
momentum of the game. For the next 30 min-

Pitt rugby dropped its third
straight league game last
Saturday, losing 17-10 to
Slippery Rock in the middle of
a downpour. The game was not
without its moments, most
notably an on-field brawl and
an off-field protest that may
result in a Slippery Rock for-
feit.

But first, the game itself.
Slippery Rock scored twice
early and took a .10-0 lead into
halftime. Pitt bounced back
immediately, with a score from
Jeff Durdah shortly after the
second-half kickoff. Rob Lewis
scored later in the half for
Pittsburgh, tying the score at 10

apiece.
“For some reason our intensi-
ty picked up 100 percent,” said

'club president and starting prop

Dave J aegar.

The club’s intensity was quite
visible after Slippery Rock net-
ted another score and a two-
point conversion kick to take
the lead 17-10. Some taunting
and a few shoves later, all hell
broke loose.

“Luckily, it didn’t really turn
into a full-scale brawl,” Jaegar
said. “People try and break it
up, but  it’s a very physical
sport —people get understand-
ably upset.”

As upsetting as the final score
was, the team still has a chance
at the Midwest" rugby tourna-
ment, despite its current 0-3

league record. Not only does it

‘A have one more league game
left, this Saturday against West

Virginia (site and time TBA),
but they may still have a shot at
winning the Slippery Rock
game. '

According to Jaegar, the team
has ﬁled a protest with the local
Allegheny Rugby Union,
accusing the Slippery Rock
team of playing graduate stu-
dents in the contest. Amazingly,
the grad player inquestion was
the older brother of a Pitt rugby
player, leading to the discovery.
If the protest is upheld, Pitt will
enter the West Virginia game
with a 1-2 league record and an
outside chance at the Midwest
tournament.

The team has had enough’

troubles this year, besides play-
ing against grad students. _
“We’ve had some problems
with injuries,” said Jaegar, who
also added that “a lot of our
guys in our back line were very
inexperienced” at playing in the
rainy conditions. Damien
Galeone was one of these back-
liners, playing his ﬁrst game at
scrum-half in the downpour.
J.D. Groff, the team’s regular
scrum-half, was injured in an
earlier contest, receiving a con-
cussion from a kick to the head.
Also injured earlier in the
season was Heath Jones, an
experienced junior ﬂy-half who
went down with a bruised lung.
Jones was responsible for the
two-point plays, both of which
missed for Pitt last Saturday.

"Strong si/enf one," Kuntz, keeps team focused

By Geoff Moak
Staﬂ Writer

Among the lighthearted banter and jok-
ing that goes on during the stretching peri-
od before the Pitt cross country team
heads out for a run, there is one constant
voice of stability, always calling out the
next stretch for the team to do.

The voice belongs to senior co-captain
Dennis Kuntz. Like everyone else, he
laughs at the funny stories that are told,
but he primarily listens and keeps the rest
of the team focused. Kuntz is what coach
Dave Sobal described as “the strong silent
one’? on the team.

‘A.

“Where someone else might take forev-
er to say something, Dennis needs about
three words,” Sobal said.

On the other hand, many of those stories
heard before practice come from the
mouth of Frank Nesko, also a senior and a
co-captain of the team. Those are two of
the few similarities between Nesko and
Kuntz. Kuntz just smiled when further
comparisons were drawn between the two.

“Between the two of us, we get every-
thing done,” Kuntz said. “I just try to do
what we’re supposed to do and not let
anybody get way out of line.”

Considering Kuntz’s schedule, it would
seem hard enough for him to do what he’s .

supposed to do without having to worry
about keeping anyone else in line. Kuntz
is in the pharmacy program at Pitt, and his
classes often conﬂict with the team’s prac-
tice times. That means he often has to do
his running alone. Not having the team
around to run with doesn’t bother Kuntz

very much. It certainly isn’t anything new A

to him. -

“In the summer, ‘I run alone a lot. I have
to,” Kuntz said. “There’s nobody else
around.”

In fact, that’s precisely the type of run-
ning Kuntz would like to continue with
after his college career ends.

Fans gather
at old wall to
remember

Maz's homer

By Nichole Gantshar
Staff Writer

They gathered by the old wall on a sunny,
Indian—summer afternoon to tell a story. A story of
once when there was a championship baseball
team in a city along the banks of three rivers. The
team played in a park on the grounds of a universi-
ty where the students would climb to the top of
their cathedral tower and watch the games until the
seventh inning. For the students knew that after the
"seventh inning, the baseball team would open up
their gates and let them into the magic field of
green.

The story was about a mythic day: Oct. 13, 1960.‘
A 24-year-old player, Bill Mazeroski, hit a home
run in the bottom of the ninth inning to win the
World Series for the Pittsburgh Pirates. The ball
park was now gone. Students walked over the ball-
park’s home plate as they ran to classes, often
oblivious that it was the
home plate of Forbes
Field.

The only other part of
the park that remained
was the left field wall.
Except for a small sec-
tion of brick with a paint-
ed mark 436 ft. peaking
out from under the ivy,
many people might not
have known the signifi-
cance of the wall.
Baseball fans

, came to the wall to cele-
—Rob Gormley brate baseball’s legacy
Pittsburgh native — perhaps to catch a lit-

tle of the World Series
fever that has eluded Pittsburgh for several years.

Rob Gormley from the Katz Business School,
who grew up in Pittsburgh, said, “A lot of people
look back at baseball and it’s like ‘a song. You can
remember what was going on that year just by the
memories.” He’s nostalgic for when baseball was
more popular, and he said he believes back in
1960, “the World Series was a big deal kind of like
the Super Bowl now,” and that the World Series is
“like a milestone that represents different parts of
life.” '

Gormley came to the event because “it’s just

at Forbes Field. “This used to be a ballpark”
his tee shirt says.

something that’s Pittsburgh history  of course it
happened way before I was born, but I’ve heard
about it.”

Another student from the Katz school, Rich
Smith, echoed Gormley when he said he was there
because Mazeroski’s home run was part of “local
lore.”

Bob Brandenstein, who had been a Pitt student in
1960, jogged down — on what he called “an
extended lunch hour” — to be part of the com-
memoration. He had played the national anthem, as
part of the Pitt band, for one of the games.

“We were not allowed to stay. There were no
seats for us,” Brandenstein said. “So we played the
Star Spangled Barmer and turned out and marched
back out the gates.”

Later that week, he watched “the first few
innings from the top of the Cathedral, and then on
the television in the student union until they opened
the gates and let students in for the seventh inning,
as they always did for Pirate home games.”

Brandenstein remembered, “I sat down with my
math book. Rocky Nelson hit a home run in the 7th
inning, and then Bill Mazeroski’s home run disap-
peared over the left ﬁeld wall over Yogi Berra’s
head”

Most in attendance were Pitt
staff, but even a few tourists,
visiting Pittsburgh from
California, joined in the remi-
niscing. People ate lunch on the
grass next to the wall. In front of
a sign marked “1960s prices,” a
concessions worker sold pop-
corn and peanuts.

Other fans asked for auto-
graphs from local sports writer
Jim O’Brien and former Pirates
player Nellie Briles. Mazeroski
was in Florida, but Briles, a
pitcher in 1971 World Series,
signed autographs for fans.

‘ Briles, now director of corporate

relations for the Pirates, was
only 10 when Mazeroski hit the
home run, but Briles, who con-
siders himself a Pittsburgher,
said he believes “this is part of
my transplanted legacy.” He
added, “If you don’t know about
the 1960 Pirates and Bill
Mazeroski’s home run, you
aren’t really a Pittsburgher.”
Briles said he sees commemora-
tions such as this as playing an
integral role in keeping the
Pirates in Pittsburgh.

“Baseball’s personal, intimate
 this is something you want to
do,” Briles said. Briles
explained the importance of the
Pirates history, saying, “The first
World Series was in 1903
between Pittsburgh and Boston.
Baseball can’t let a franchise
with that kind of history move
somewhere else where the past
doesn’t mean anything. So it’s
important that this is passed on
generation to generation.”

utes, both teams struggled to get
the go—ahead goal. Now it was
CMU with the scoring chances.

“Things fell apart,” said
Luxbacher of the Panthers’ play.
"They played harder.”

As the game came down to the
wire, tempers were on edge, and
nerves were hanging out. Both
teams were annoyed and com-
plaining about every call made by

the officials. The comment “only '

in America they make that call”
was yelled from the CMU bench.
Luxbacher said the refs didn’t
affect the outcome of the game.

“Our play was much poorer
than the refs’ ,” Luxbacher said.

As the final seconds ticked
away, overtime was inevitable.
Both tezuns took a break before
the beginning of overtime.
Luxbacher said that the first 90
minutes were not good. His
advice to his team before over-
time got underway was to “forget
the first 90 minutes.”

With 11:03 left in the first 15-
minute overtime, Pitt freshman
Drew Kopp scored to put Pitt
ahead 2-1.

Before it was all said and done.
Pitt added another goal to put the
game out of reach.

“We're happy with the win,”
Luxbacher said.
