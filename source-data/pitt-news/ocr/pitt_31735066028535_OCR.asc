The British National Debate
team visited Pitt yesterday to spar
against the Wﬂliam Pitt Debating
Union as part of its 10 week, 31
city tour of the United States. The
team has been touring the U.S. for
the past two-and—a—half weeks.

The British team —— Dan
Neidle and Andrea Sloan — faced
Maxwell Schnurer and John Butler
of the WPDU in the English

of Leaming. Their topic: "This

Gordon Mitchell, WPDU’
director of debate and event chair-
man, said it was an honor to have
the British team come to Pitt.

The parliamentary—style
debate, a format that deviates from
the normal set—up the WPDU uses,
was divided into three stages.
During the ﬁrst stage both sides
presented their arguments during
seven—minute speeches and then

an opposing—team member could
ask the speaker questions.

Carl Lewis leaps into Pitt Stadium to give organ transplants a boost  

Hillary Stevenson

Staff Wrlter

At the age of 18, Carl Lewis
was already on the mark for a career
in which he would claim nine gold
medals and one silver medal while
representing the United States on
ﬁve Olympic track teams.

But on a late autumn day in
l989,_ when he met Wendy Marx,
his life began a course on a new
track.

Marx, then in her early 20s,
was suffering from hepatitis B and

needed a liver transplant.

Her struggle wasn't for
Olympic gold. It was for life.

After joining his good friend
and Wendy's brother, Jeffrey, in an
ongoing vigil for her recovery,
Lewis became committed to the
mission of encouraging people to
become organ donors.

Yesterday morning, while
standing in the middle of a sun-
drenched Pitt stadium, Lewis urged
a crowd of 300 area high school stu-
dents, Pitt students and several Pitt
officials to join him in the advance-

ment of organ donation.

"It's about choices," Lewis told
the crowd of students, teachers,
members of Pitt's medical commu-
nity, and several people whose lives
have been saved by organ trans-
plants. "You can make the right
choice and advance yourself or you
can make the wrong choice and suf-
fer the consequences."

The UPMC Health System and
the Oxford Development Company
sponsored Lewis‘ visit, dubbed
"One More Victory Lap for Organ
Donation." Lewis retired from his

track and ﬁeld career three weeks
ago during the Pitt—Houston foot-
ball game in Texas. '

According to Dr. John Fung,
the chief of transplant surgery at
UPMC, 70,000 people in the
United States needed transplants
last year. Nationwide, however,
there were only 5,000 donors.

"One person can affect the lives
of so many, so [organ donation] is a
good thing," Fung said in his open-
ing remarks.

upcoming programs, as well as a review of

Pitt's technological needs. Also targeted is ‘

the implementation of student suggestions
gathered during meetings throughout the
year and increased efﬁciency within individ-
ual academic programs.

"There is a resolution to make all pro-
gramslookatwhattheyarcdoingandstate
clearly what needs to be done for the success
of the program 10 years ﬁom now," Maher
said. "This is all coming out of the chancel-
lor setting the right climate for change. He
wants to see improvement. "

While much of the academic authority
within the University is delegated to -the
provost, Nordenberg must deal with many
external constituencies, Maher said
, Developing relationships with federal-,
state- and city—govemment officials and with
the corporate business community is a
responsibility that the chancellor primarily
holds, and one that has not been overlooked
by the trustees.

VVrth Nordenberg at the helm, donations
to Pitt totaled $55 million this year, a $15-
million increase from last year.

"Nordenberg is very etfective in this
capacity," Pitt «spokesman Ken Service
noted He added that "$15 million is a very
substantial amormt of money for a universi-
ty that was not involved in any major fund-

. raising campaignlastyear." .

DJ. Oshry, assistant vice chancellor and
campaign director for the Oﬁice of
Institutional Advancement, the oﬁice
responsible for securing private donations,

"Hehasbeenvery active, andasaresult
the University has seen an increase in
funds," he said.

Aside from fund-raising, the trustees
highlighted the quality of student life as
something they want to see improved.

Nordenberg attacked this problem by
moving the Oﬂice of Student Aﬂ°airs under
the direction of the provost, said Bob
Gallagher, vice chancellor for student affairs.

"We always felt a little outside of

things," he said "Now we are clearly aligned
with the academic area of the University, and

more resomces are being put into student‘

services than ever before."

These resources are being used to
increase resources in the counseling center
and learning-skills center, add stall“ in the dis-
ability-services oﬂice, and promote changes
in the job-placement center to enable stu-
dents to relate their education to career inter-
ests. »

And athletics haven't escaped
Nordenberg's eye, either.

"He has complete oversight responsibil-
ity on all areas of athletics," said Pitt
Athletics Director Steve Pederson. "He
decides our voting positions on Big East
Conference rules and NCAA rI1les which
deal with things like ﬁnancial aid and
recruiting."

Because Pitt is often regarded as a
research institution, the trustees also sought
anincreaseinboththesizeandthequalityof
its research programs. .

While recovering from a drop in the
quality of research programs during the
1995-96 ﬁscal year, Pitt's Oﬂice of Research
is experiencing an increase in the amount of
research activities, said Research Director
Michael Crouch.

"University leadership is certainly
important, but the expertise and excellence
oftheresearchersandthenatnreoftheir
research also contributes," he said

VVrth three-quarters of research dollars
coming from govermnent agencies and pri-
vate organizations, many universities,
including Pitt, are being hit hard by the
recentdecreaseinfundsfromthesesources.

This presents new challenges to

research institutions and creates a greater

need for effective leadership, according to
George Klinzing, vice provost for research.
"Administrators must make the best
decisions possible," he said. "As the chief
responsible officer of the University, the
chancellor needs to ﬁnd those officers and
administrators best suited for the job."

DEBATE

The second stage involved 20 minutes
of audience participation in which anyone
in attendance was able to ask questions of
either team.

The third stage featured a speaker
delivering a three—minute summation of his
argument.

Neidle said that debating in America is
very dilferent from debating in England.

"Generally, English debates will start at
8:00 p.m.," Neidle said. "There'll be wine,
and the audience will be drinking all the
way through the night, as well as the speak-
ers."

While American debaters nonnally
argue in front of a panel of judges or fellow
academics for a deﬁnite win, Neidle said
English debating style is more a struggle to
convince an audience to support your argu-
ment. He said British debate is comparable,
in a sense, to a "popularity contest."

FROM PAGE 1

Sloan agreed, and said U.S. debate is
based more on technical evidence and a pro-
gression of facts, while British debate
requires the use of good audience relations
skills.

All the debaters present agreed that
debating is a fun, mind-opening activity.

As for the tour, Neidle and Sloan say
they're having a great time.

"It's all paid for, it's great fun, and a fan-
tastic opportunity to see half of America. ",
said Neidle.

"We've been all over the Northeast,
we've seen the beautiful fall, we've visited
Boston and we've seen the famous [com-
ﬁelds] of Iowa," said Sloan. (The cornﬁelds
of Iowa are a popular image associated with
America in Great Britain.)

As for the popularity contest in this
debate, the audience voted in favor of the
House.

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center was rated one of the
top 100 best employers in the
United States for working mothers
in the October issue of Working
Mother magazine. The UPMC was
also the only Pittsburgh employer
included in the top 100. ’

"Obviously, our employees are
our most important resource," said
Susan Manko, assistant director of
the UPMC's news bureau.

In making its selections for its
annual top-100 list, Working
Mother chose the country's work-
places that best provide support for
child care, opportunities for women
to advance within the company, pay
compared to ‘competing organiza-
tions, adoption counseling, time
ﬂexibility, and leave for childbirth.

"The UPMC is very proud of its
commitment to helping working
mothers and fathers maintain a
healthy balance between work and
home," said Sidney. Seligman,
director of human resources at the
hospital.

The magazine selects 100 busi-
nesses and corporations for its list
but does not rank them.

THE PITT NEWS

UPMC selected among top lOO working-mother employers

In addition to being the only
Pittsburgh company to earn the
honor, the UPMC is one of only
three hospitals in the nation to make
the top 100. In fact, hospitals rarely
make the list because many of them
are not for profit, and, unlike the
UPMC, most are not large enough
to gain grants and donations to fund
employee family programs, said
Manko.

Employee family programs are
abound at UPMC, including the
professional day-care center, Small
Wonders, in which 100 children of
employees are enrolled. The center
is run by Corporate Family

Solutions, one of the country's.

largest providers of employer—spon-
sored child-care programs.

"We let them do it because
they're the experts," said Manko. ‘

Although her child is not
enrolled in the day-care center,
Manko is the mother of a 2-year-
old. She said the UPMC was very
cooperative in giving her maternity
leave and a ﬂexible work schedule
after her baby was born. Manko
also noted that in her seven years at
the UPMC, she has always been
happy with her benefits and the
employee services offered.

LEWIS

from the crowd, Lewis jokingly told the
students, "I got you out of school for the
day and you can't even say 'Hello' to me?"

Lewis then took a serious tone and
urged the students to stay in school and
strive for excellence. He also asked them to
consider the importance of organ donation.

"You can't achieve" success without
education. My parents were teachers and, if
I forgot for one second the importance of an
education, they were right there to remind
me," he said.

Lewis said education can also destroy
the fears that many people have about
organ donation. «

"There are myths to organ donation,
such as taking an organ before a person dies
or that if they take someone's corneas

r=RoM PAGE 1

they'll have to bury the person with sun-

glasses. The myths come from a lack of
education," Lewis said.

"Understanding organ donation is
about understanding responsibility," he
said. "Becoming a donor won't change

your life tomorrow, but it'll change some-
one's life one day."

One of the people whose life may be
changed by .Lewis' message about organ
donation is 14-year-old Ordell Reynolds.

Reynolds, who has been on a waiting list
for a transplant for two years joined Lewis
in addressing the audience.

"There are others like me, some sicker,
who need a new organ to live," he said in a
quiet voice before the crowd.

Lewis said he believes it's important to
talk to kids about organ donation, because
they go on to spread the word to their fam-
ilies.

"If we get the kids passionate about it,
they'll go home and tell their parents and
the parents will tell their co-workers,"
Lewis said. "The word will eventually
spr ."

Lewis went on to say that teenagers
should decide for themselves about becom-
ing an organ donor and then make their
wishes known to their families. '

If 16-year-old Michael Eddy had not
conveyed his wishes to his family, he
wouldn't have helped save someone else's
life after he was killed in a car accident a
year ago. His mother, Jan, was at Pitt
Stadium to convey the success that arose
from her family's tragedy.

"The decision was our family's, but the
direct, ultimate and unselfish gift was
Michael's," said Eddy.

Pausing to regain her composure,
Eddy's voice cracked as she explained how
difficult organ donation was for her to con-
sent to, even though it's what her son want-
ed.

"We struggled in making the decision,
but now more than a beautiful memory
lives on," she said before embracing her
husband.

Dedra Croll, who received a liver
transplant in UPMC during 1993, knows
first hand about receiving the gift of life
from someone unknown.

"Because of the kindness of a total
stranger and because his family said yes, I
was given a second chance," said Croll, a
38-year-old native of Vernon, NY.

Following Lewis’ speech, the students
and their teachers joined him on the field.
In a scene like reminiscent of the Olympic
ceremonies, Lewis, holding an American
ﬂag, and the crowd, wearing green ribbons
and carrying green and white balloons,
jogged one lap around the stadium. As they
slowly made their way around the stadi-
urn's track, the percussion section from
Schenley High School pounded out a
melody.

Green, a color that often symbolizes
life, also represents the organ donation
advocacy.

Lewis was also promoting his new
book, "One More Victory Lap," which
chronicles his experiences in the 1996
Olympics. He co-wrote the book with
Jeffrey Marx. Lewis donated 400 copies of
his book to Pittsburgh—area school libraries.

After the event at the stadium, Lewis
signed autographs and toured the transplant
units at UPMC and Children's Hospital.

As for Wendy Marx, her brother said
she is doing better. She needed another
transplant in 1992, but today she is healthy.
And most importantly, he said, she has a
tomorrow to move on to.

Where the chancellor can
put the money he's raised

Everybody seems to be in agreement that
Chancellor Nordenberg has been doing a great job
of fund-raising in the past year. So, with all of this
money, he has the opportunity to make some
major improvements in Pitt. Here are a few things
he can do that would make this a first-class uni-
versity: .

° Everybody seems to equate the quality of
Pitt’s graduate programs with the quality of
research being done here, but there are many pro-
grams that simply can’t be graded that way. Isn’t it
about time the law and business schools were
ranked in the countryls top 10?

- Give some of that money back to the students
in forms that will benefit them most directly, like
new dorms. Pursuit of undergraduate excellence is
supposed to be one of the five major goals that the
trustees have set for Nordenberg, but it is really
hard for undergraduates to pursue their own excel-
lence when they live in substandard housing.
Studying for finals can’t be easy when you’re
crammed into a suite with eight other people.

0 A lot of fund-raising comes from Pitt alumni,
so it makes sense that the more alumni who are
financially successful, the more money will
become availablein the future. To ensure success
for its graduates, Pitt needs a first-class job—place-
ment program. When more students aren’t looking
at financial ruin because they built up outrageous

debts while in college and while waiting for a job, ~

then the more alumni donations Pitt is liable to
find in the coming years.

0 The single most important thing Pitt can do
to directly help its students is to provide more
need- and merit-based scholarships. With the cost
of an education here going up every year, and
many students are already coming here because it
was the best they could afford, Pitt should show its
appreciation and try to ease the financial burden
that many of us will have to live with for years to
come.

Fitness fads are just running in circles

After you climb 114 ﬂoors,
you’d think that you’d get a great
view of something really beautiful,
like a city skyline, a nifty sunset or
maybe the space shuttle Atlantis. All
I got was a blinking light and a digi-
tal “CONGRATULATIONS” from
a pencil-sized digital display.

Besides the fact I had spent the
past 21 minutes working really hard
to get absolutely nowhere, I realized
ifl died right then and there my
tombstone would probably read
something like “Another victim of
the technological revolution” or just
simply “Ha, ha.” A

Every year, the “health indus-

who brought you such great things
as pain, suﬂ’en'ng and Powerbars —
introduces new and more interesting
gadgets for us to expend enough

Aimed with nothing more than
some money and thefour “perfectly

advertisers have managed to con-

that, yes, we too can look like those

plastic models‘ they used in high

Hopefully, however, our skin
doesn’t pop off as easily as the mod-
els and we actually have the repro-
ductive regions that my teacher, Mr.
Walbridge, used to lock in the closet
so we wouldn’t leave them arranged
on his desk in compromising posi-
tions by the time he arrived in the

don’t fall off in the middle of class

So in an advertising campaign
slightly better than that of the Chia

working people lined up to stand in
a small tributary of other people’s
sweat, waiting to use machines that
are conceptually based on designs
from the Spanish Inquisition. Not

I only that, but they’ve got us paying

to wait in those lines.

These same ﬁtness marketers
are a species closely related to the
television marketer. Just turn on the
television after a long day at what-
ever you hamien to do every day that
leaves you with just enough energy
to collapse in front of the television
after pressing the “on” button, and
you’ll see what I mean. Right in the

there’ll be a commercial for either a)
some sort of ﬁtness machine b)
some sort of ﬁtness center or c)

these individuals manage to keep a

POINT/COUNTERPOINT

Joe
Ciprietti

When you think of the term “capital
punishment,” what are some of the
thoughts and images that immediately
pop into your mind? Do words like
lethal injection, electric chair, ﬁring
squads, and hangings all ring a bell?
Americans should be familiar with these
methods of destruction, because they are
the legitimate methods for disposal of
human life within our country. These

inventions created by our society are

designed to eliminate those people who
have been convicted of a crime for
which the only way to achieve so-called
justice is through the termination of that
individual’s life.

Does capital punishment achieve
justice within the United‘ States? This is
the main question that must
addressed. Capital punishment is inte
ed to rid society of individuals who
committed crimes that are so hein;
that they must be paid for with that 
son’s life. Who really has the powei‘
take life away from individuals? The 1
time I checked, it was originally meant
to be God.

Supporters of capital punishment
are dealing with life, not just the law.
When we give the state the right to exe-

_ cute our fellow citizens, we place a great

deal of wet in the hands of ale al sys-
tem th  " ' 

    

   

 
 

life away fr 
to satisfy the victirrrs is not a very logi-
cal way to deal with society’s problems.
The death penalty will not create a bet-
ter world. A bad seed will be replaced by
another, and crime will never go away.

While other nations around the
world are abolishing the death penalty,
states such as New York are reviving the
use of this savage method of punish-
ment. Gov. Pataki of New York signed a
law extending the use of the death
penalty for seven categories of homi-
cide. This trend is sweeping the nation.
A total of 37 states have reinstated the
death penalty — a sad commentary for a
nation that places such a high regard on
human rights. The government is quick
to attack nations such as China on
human-rights violations, yet our nation
leads the world in executions of juvenile
offenders (six since 1990).

At this time, 57 countries have abol-
ished the death penalty for all crimes. If
you examine the speciﬁc countries that

  

:13 W O -9:

Kill the death penalty!

have done away with the death penalty,
you will notice that nations such as
South Africa, Cambodia, Romania, and
Hong Kong all make the list. If nations
like South Africa and Cambodia realize
that the death penalty is inhumane, what
does that say for our nation? Not too
much!’ Americans talk the talk on
hurrran-rights issues, yet we support and
enforce capital-punishment laws in our
own backyard. Maybe the United States
should examine itself before it passes
judgment on nations that we feel are the
so-called human-rights abusers.
Defenders of capital punishment
and the death penalty within the United
States claim that the death penalty is a
deterrent to crime. But there is no scien-

' tiﬁc evidence that the death penalty

deters crime. Homicides in the United
States have not, sto ped due t ' °

 

to maintain and operate.

There is not much sympathy in this
country of ours for people accused of a
capital crime. The emerging attitude
ong American 's very cl

   

 

 
 

   

 ' th id c _ 5'hen
the news media prints this kind of sick
and twisted garbage? McVeigh is still a
human being! Who gave the media the
right to play God and pass judgment on
a fellow citizen? Revenge is not going to

bring the dead back to life. How can you —

get satisfaction from watching a human
being fry in an electric chair? -

Capital punishment is not the solu-
tion to deter crime within the United
States. We, as Americans, need to take a
closer look at ourselves and really think
whether killing is the answer to society’s’
problems. Capital punishment is a bar-
baric system that needs to be disman-
tled. No government or state should
have the authority to take human life
away. This power should be in the hands
of a higher being, ‘not society and its
laws.

Joe Ciprietti believes that murder is
wrong,. no matter what side of the court-
room you are sitting on.

  

 

All murderers must try!

Carrie
Hager

For such a heinous crime as mur-
der, the death penalty is the only fair
punishment and should be more wide-
spread in use. Unless killing is in self-'
defense or is involuntary manslaughter,
the taking of human life should not go
unpunished. '

The methods of execution have _

changed throughout the years, but from
beheadings, to hangings, to the lethal
injection, one thing has remained the
same. Justice. When a murderer is exe-
cuted, justice is served, for the victim,
the victim’s family and for society. The
punishment has to ﬁt the crime.
Deterrence is an important point
with the death penalty. If every mur-
d rer ted '

      

   
 
   
  
   
    

er.
Those against the death penalty
seem to value the life of the murderer
more than the lives of innocent victims
who could be saved through deter-
rence. If a person knew for a fact that if
  . d  . e,  e

   

 

crimes are committed because the pun-
ishments are not only more severe but
are always followed through. For all
the murders that are committed in this
country every year, there are very few
executions. There is. a lesson to be
learned from the treatment of murder-
ers in other countries that the United
States just can’t seem to understand.
Now this brings up another point:
brutality. Those against the death
penalty say that it’s too brutal. But the
United States currently uses the most
humane forms of executions.
Obviously, executing someone will
always be seen as brutal, but isn’t it
supposed to be? Most of the time, the
victim suffered much more than the
murderer who is executed. Execution
isn’t brutal when the victim deserved
none of his suffering and the murderer
deserves any suffering he has coming.

I’ve heard enough about protecting the

   

murderer’s rights. If someone takes a
life, then he deserves to suffer, plain
and simple. ' i

As for objections on religious
grounds, "consider that the Bible says,
“Thou shall not kill,” and goes on to
explain that if someone commits a
murder, then he will be put to death.
So, religiously, the death penalty is
just. ,

The most important point in favor
of the death penalty is the administra-
tion of justice. If a person takes a life,
it seems fair that he should pay for it
with his own life. Too often, though,
justice is not served. Instead, the pun-
ishment doesn’t ﬁt the crime, and those
who commit such a heinous crime as
murder get off easy. »A

Some say that the death penalty is
unjust. But when a person commits a
murder, he willingly takes the risk that
if he is caught, he might be put to
death. The death penalty is a risk that
the murderer willingly takes, and a risk
that could have been avoided had the
murder not been committed. Any pun-
 htrent the murderer gets is a punish-
the consciously risked receiving.
If a murderer is executed, he gets
what he deserves, and justice is served.
It is very important that justice be
served for the victim, whose life was so
unfairly taken.

It does say in the Constitution that

61‘

 

I punisent like to use is the risk of

innocent people being executed. This
happens very infrequently, and is not a
good enough reason to abolish the
death penalty. Our justice system isn’t
perfect, and perhaps once in a while an
innocent person is executed. This is
sad, but is a necessary evil, because
almost all who are executed do deserve
it.

If you are still against the death
penalty, here is something to think
about: If someone close to you was
brutally murdered, can you honestly
say you wouldn’t want the murderer to
die? I know I couldn’t. In fact, I’m sure
most of you out there couldn't say so
either.

Carrie Hager is much in favor of the
death penalty and believes every mur-
derer, rapist, and child molester should
be put to death, for such people don’t
deserve to be in our society.

  

Beware the
Irish invasion

Prepare for the invasion.

Just when you thought it was safe to
root for a team with gold helmets and navy
uniforms, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish
are coming to Pitt Stadium.

Pitt and Notre Dame may be color-

coordinated, but the two squads have been '

heading in different directions ever since
the start of the season, when the Panthers
replaced legendary J ohrmy Majors with the
young, energetic Walt Harris and the Irish

_ replaced legendary Lou Holtz with the

young, energetic Bob Davie.

Youth and energy have been served at
Pitt; youth and energy have turned the
Notre Dame program into a 1-4 disaster
area, with the most recent embarrassment
coming last weekend at Stanford.

The Irish dropped the contest 33-15.
They have been outscored this season by a
total of 48 points. Their lone win came
against Georgia Tech — a 17-13 squeaker
at Notre Dame Stadium. _

So why worry? Notre Dame has lost
its magic, and the Pitt Panthers, despite that
little snag at the Vet last week, have a “new
attitude.” Right?

Wrong.

There is something to be said for old
attitude; Notre Dame may prove that to the
Panthers this weekend.

Despite the record, despite the fan out-
rage, and despite the downgrading of Notre
Darne’s famous religious mural to “Field
Goal Jesus,” the Irish will still pose a num-
ber of problems for the Panthers.

First, there’s the little matter of fan sup-
port. While Pitt will pack the student sec-
tion and bring in some alumni, the South
Bend contingent will more than assist the
Panther faithful in ﬁlling the stadium wiﬂi
Blue and Gold.

Instead of playing without a crowd like
last week, the Panthers will face a loud,
near-sellout throng — a mix of inebriated
students and devout Catholics screaming at
anything that moves.

Should be quite a culture shock — the
football equivalent of attending a matinee
perfonnance of the Pittsburgh Opera, then
stopping in at the Civic Arena to catch
OzzFest.

Some might scoff at fan impact on a
squad, but remember this — every home
win this season has been attributed to fan
support by both the players and the coach-
es. After the Miami game, Walt Harris
thanked the fans so much that it seemed
like he’d just won a People’s Choice
Award.

The mixed crowd will not help Pitt’s
chances. Neither will Ron Powlus —— the

With a 17-13 loss to the Temple Owls

I still lingering in the air, Tuesday’s practice

served as a wake-up call for the Pitt
Panther football squad.

“Practice was a little more intense for
a while today. It was a big learning day,”
said Head Coach Walt Harris.

Coach Hanis seemed pleased with
the overall effort of the practice, which is
a good sign considering the lack of emo-
tion this past Saturday. Harris cited wide
receiver Teny Murphy as an example for
the rest of team, which is attempting to
reclaim its intensity before squaring off
against Notre Dame this weekend.

Murphy was hurt in the Temple
game, and Coach Harris said he “looked
dead” after nmning the difficult practice.

‘Terry grew up today. He came out
and pushed himself in spite of his injury,”
Harris said. ’

Harris hopes that the same intensity
will carry over to the Notre Dame chal-
lenge. - _

Pitt hockey starts new year in new league

It’s aseason of new tidings for the Pitt
ice hockey team. New players, new
coaches, a new conference and a new
strategy.

“Depth-wise we’re a little thinner
than last year,” said goaltender Dave
Ciarletta “We’re being optimistic, though.
It looks like we’ve got a better coaching

staff this year and the players all together V

seem more dedicated.”

Despite key losses and coaching
changes, Ciarletta cites the Panthers’
offense as the primary element of a poten-
tially successful season. .

. But the team’s attackers won’t be des-
ignated simply as ﬂie offense; the strategy

for the new-looking, offensively dominant _

Panthers will incorporate defense ——
almost stress defense to a fault, as a matter
of fact. .

“In spite of the defensive losses, you
think that if you have a good offense,
you’re going to play the oﬂ°ensive part
stronger. But actually, we’re going to be
playing in ‘a more defensive mode,”
Ciarletta explained. ’

“Which doesn’t mean that we’ll be in
our own zone this whole year, but what
we’re going to do is use our offense to

pressure the opposition and to keep them
in their zone.”

Defense not withstanding, the other
offensive focus is to strategically use the
strong core players in their respective roles
as forwards and defensemen. This tech-
nique will allow them to remain competi-
tive against top area teams the Panthers
haven’t faced in previous years. ‘

Returning forwards include center
Anthony Muﬁi and wingers Kris Getzik,
Ryan. Moore and Jake Polachak. The
youngsters on the front line include Dan
Lenza and Bill Maclean.

The Panthers lost some key players
on the defensive side, including captain
Matt White (who is recovering from off-
season ankle surgery) and Toki Barron,
Bob Hoehn and Dan Woodbury —- all
three of whom graduated last spring. Tony
Hennankevich returns to the blue line and
will pair up with multi-purpose ‘player
Mark Hoehn — the younger brother of
former Pitt defenseman Bob. 1

“Mark played with us last year but
didn’t play defense all the time,” said
Ciarletta. “I have a feeling he’ll be playing
a larger defensive role this season.”

Dave Konn and Tony Elder will man
the blue line as well, adding to the pool of
talent that the Panthers‘ gained over the
summer. Returning in the nets  be the

goaltending trio of Ciarletta, Patrick

' Kenny and Ian Lebwohl, but a decision on

the starting keeper won’t be made until the
beginning of the season.

Another key gain for the Panthers was
the new coaching staff. Former Head
Coach Richard ~ Rizzo departed for
Chicago this summer and was replaced by
Jim Brown, whose 15,years of coaching
experience includes stints heading the
Amateur Penguins and several Pittsburgh
select teams. T‘wo assistant coaches join
Brown behind the bench —— Wally Sheide,
who played for the Panﬂiers last year, and
Wade Chouinard.

‘Joining the American Collegiate ‘

Hockey Association will also be a tremen-
dous hurdle for the Pitt hockey team. The
ACHA consists of over 200 schools
around ﬂie country and is a step up in cal-
iber from the Western Pennsylvania
Collegiate Hockey teams the Panthers
have traditionally faced.

The Pitt hockey team will face pri-
marily ACHA competition this season,
including Penn State, University of
Maryland, West Virginia and Drexel.

The Panthers face-off against
Shippensburg University at 8:30 p.m.
Friday in IUP’s season-opener tourna-
ment. They then play Saturday afternoon

Tribe, 0's set for American
League pennant showdown

John Abernathy

Staff Wrlter

The 1997 American League
Championship Series begins tonight, with
the Baltimore Orioles and the Cleveland
Indians making the ﬁnal cut.

The Orioles come into the series off an
impressive win against the Seattle Mariners,
having needed only four games to win the
best-of-ﬁve series. The Indians, however,
needed a little more effort in putting the
New York Yankees’ lights out.

Here’s how the squads match up:

Starting Rotation - Good pitching has been
the key to Baltimore’s success thus far this
season. This was proved in Mike Mussina’s
performance in game four against the
Mariners, where he threw a gem of a game
on only three days’ rest against the best
pitcher in baseball. , 1

Cleveland has an impressive rotation
with ﬂue likes of Charles Nagy and Orel
Hershiser, but its pitching still doesn’t match
up to the consistency of the Orioles.
Advantage: Baltimore

First Base - This is a strength for both
teams: The Indians’ Jim Thorne (40 homers
and 102 RBIs on the season) and the
Orioles’ Rafael Palmeiro are both all-star
performers, but the edge here goes to the
younger Thorne.

Advantage: Cleveland

Second Base - At second base, Baltimore
features one of the best overall performers in
the game. Roberto Alomar can get it done
on the ﬁeld or at the plate. C1eveland’s Tony
Fernandez is mediocre at best.
A no-brainer here.
Advantage: Baltimore

Shortstop - Not the highlight position for
either club, both Omar Vrsquel for the
Indians and Mike Bordick for the Orioles
provide ﬁne defense. Both have been hitting
well in the postseason, but Vrsquel had a
career series against the Yankees, clubbing
his way to a .500 batting average.
Advantage: Cleveland

ThirdBase-MattW1lliams isaproven
offensive threat. He smacked 32 homers and
reeled in 105 RBIs during the regular sea-
son, but he has not come through in the post-
season. On the other hand, Cal Ripken is on
ﬁre in ﬂre post-season, batting .438 so far.
Advantage: Baltimore

Left Field - The Orioles have platooned
several players at this position, including
BJ. Surhoﬂ" and Eric Davis, but Jeffrey
Harnmonds isthe most regular. C1eve1and’s
Bip Roberts had an impressive series against
New York, plus he provides plenty of speed
in the ﬁeld and on the bases. Hammonds’.
deep-ball threat doesn’t make up for the dif-

ferenoe.
Advantage: Cleveland

Center Field - Brady Anderson is one of the
top players on Baltirnore’s impressive roster.
Aside from this, he is hitting well in his post-
season campaign (.353 for the series).
Marquis Grissom is a solid player with less-
than-irnpressive regular-season numbers,
hitting .262 with 12 home runs and 66 RBIs.
He did not make up for it in the wild—card
series. V

Advantage: Baltimore

Right Field - Baltimore can again platoon at
this position between Harmnonds, Surhoff
and Davis. Surhoff’s numbers on the year
are impressive (.284, 18 homers, 88 RBIs),
but he saw limited play with minimal pro-
duction against Seattle. Indians right ﬁelder
Manny Ramirez did not hit well in the New
York series, but his .328 batting average, 26
home runs and 88 RBIs show that he is
always a threat.

Advantage: Cleveland

Catcher - Cleveland all-star Sandy Alomar
is a consistent player who was one of the
American League’s top hitters this season,
posting a .324 batting average to go along
with his good defensive skills. Baltimore’s
Chris Hoiles did little in terms of run pro-
duction, or any kind of offensive production

1 for that matter.

Advantage: Cleveland

Designated Hitter - Cleveland has been
using David Justice in this spot for much of
the post—season. He is an offensive jugger-
naut, slarnming 33 home runs hitting for a
whopping .329 average. Baltimore has two
options —— either the experienced Harold
Baines, who continues to produce, or
Geronimo Berroa, who is a nice comple-

ment with 26 homers and 90 RBIs,

Whoever is in there will not compare to
Justice.
Advantage: Cleveland

Bullpen - Randy Myers was the best reliev-
er in baseball this year, throwing his way to
a league-leading 45 saves and a microscop-
ic 1.51 ERA for Baltimore. However,
Myers’ supporting cast is weak Cleveland
can send out either Paul Assenrnacher, Jose
Mesa (16 saves, a 2.40 ERA) or Mike
Jackson, just to name a few. It’s close, but
Baltimore gets the edge despite having little
depth.

Advantage: Baltimore

Cleveland has the talent it takes to win,
but it was not consistent in regular-season
play; thereis noreasontothinkthatthiswill
change now. The Indians will provide an
exciting series, but look for Baltimore to win
this one to set up the inevitable Orioles-
Braves rnatchup in the World Series.
Prediction: Baltimore in six games

 

Panther rugby club still in    

search of year’: first victory

Patrick Robertson
Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh men’s rugby club had a
brief lead against a nationally ranked Penn
State club in the Panther ruggers’ ﬁrst game
of the season, nearly one month ago.

They would go on to lose by nearly 40
points. The season hasn’t gotten much bet-
ter since — they are 04 after a 38-11 loss
to sixth-ranked Indiana University of
Pennsylvania last weekend.

The Panthers were outsized and out-
played in the ﬁrst half versus IUP, accord-
ing to Head Coach Dan Talbert. They could
do little against the powerhouse from
Western Pennsylvania.

IUP came out and made big plays
early, giving it a 27-3 lead at the half.
Pittsburgh’s only points came‘ on a Kyle

Hubbard penalty kick.

At the half, the Panthers made some
adjustments and came out strong when
play resumed. They held IUP to only one
try and scored one of their own — the hard
way.

Pitt’s Alan Bunteman got the ball ﬁve
yards out ﬁom the try zone, lowered his
head and banged his way in for a try. He
broke ﬁve tackles on his way to a well-
deserved score.

Unfortunately, that was all the Panthers
were able to muster in another defeat;
putting this one play aside, the team has had
a lot of problems with intensity this season,
according to Talbert.

“We played with a lot more intensity
today, and we learned a lot that will help us
through the rest of the season,” Rosensteel
said. »

After the rugby team’s crushing defeat
at Penn State in the ﬁrst weekend of the
season, the players did a lot of rtmning and
hoped to be much more prepared for the
rest of their season.

They started by playing the Maryland

club team of the Uniﬁed Health Services

—— a part of the military health service, not
a college squad.

Uniﬁed Health scored ﬁrst to make the
game 7-0. It played with a very high level
of concentration for the rest of the game,
Talbert said. I

Pittsburgh got on the board very late in
the game, when it scored its second try of
the year with about 15 minutes remaining.
The Panthers then missed the conversion,
which left them with a 7-5 loss.

Pitt did not seem to have the fire that

Coach Talbert thought was needed to win

the game.

“There was no enthusiasm in the
pack,” he said. The Panthers were inside
their opponents’ ﬁve—yard line three times,
but could not punch the ball into the try
zone.

The next weekend, Pitt played the
Ohio University Bobcats. The Bobcats
came in intense, and once again, the
Panthers did not. Ohio took home a 24-0
victory. ,

“Once you start pedaling backwards,
there is no way to stop yourse ,” Talbert
said. _

Two weeks ago, the Panthers took on
the Mountaineers of West Virginia. Once
again, the intensity was lacking, and Pitt
suffered a big loss, falling 20-0 to WVU.

“It sucked!” exclaimed Coach Talbert
when asked about the loss. ”We’re making
stupid mistakes, and everybody’s doing it.”

The rugby team will start its quest to
restart the season this weekend at the
University of Pennsylvania. Penn is one of
the worst schools Pitt will play this year -
the Panthers scored a 72-0 win over the
Quakers last spring. The team expects -a big
win this weekend to get some conﬁdence
back and give it something to build on,
according to Rosensteel.

senior; he’ll be ready,” said Harris.

‘Senior Billy West is not listed on Pitt’s
injury report, but he has been nursing an
unspeciﬁed injury he suffered at Temple.
West’s jersey had to be cut off after the
Temple game for trainers to treat his injury.

The second—stn'ng rusher was running
the stadium bleachers most of practice
Tliesday, missing out on early action with
the Panther offense.

Quarterback Pete Gonzalez wasn’t"

sure about West’s status, but said it would
be a big loss if he can’t play.

If Billy West can’t play or sees only
limited action on Saturday, it will seriously
weaken an already depleted Panther run-
ning game. Backup running back Hank
Poteat switched to starting comerback

. against Temple, and the depth at that posi-

tion now consists primarily of the fresh-
man duo of Kevan Barlow and Rickey
Mendenhall. Barlow has only one carry
this year — in the opening game against
Southwestern Louisiana, he fumbled early
in the second quarter.

Despite the troubles in his backﬁeld,
Gonzalez was optimistic about playing
against Notre Dame again.

‘*I’ve gone against Notre Dame
before. I’ve thrown a touchdown against
them. I’ll be ready,” Gonzalez said.

“We’1l‘go out and scrap and win,” he
added. '

Harris cited Gonzalez as a quiet leader
on the ﬁeld. “His leadership is by example.
The guysplike being around him,” Harris
said. *

Gonzalez said that the Panthers will be
‘emotionally ready and intense for
Saturday, despite their problems with the
Owls.

- Pitt trouble.

The Irish senior from nearby Berwick
was picked ’ by legendary sportswriter
Beano Cook as a possible candidate for the
Heisman Trophy in his freshman season,
and in every season after that.

To say Powlus has come up a bit short

would be like saying the Tampa Bay ‘

Buccaneers have just barely exceeded pre-
season expectations. While his numbers
have been solid for the most part, Powlus
has yet to have his breakout year. _
This just in: This season isn’t it, either.
Dwelling on the senior’s subpar per-
formance is one way to boost conﬁdence

THE PITT NEWS

(and get a nice chuckle), but thinking that
he’ll continue such horrible play in his
hometown is borderline lunacy. _

If Ron Powlus has any ability to rise
to a situation, this will be the game to
prove it.

Sad to say, I happen to think he does.
I mean, this guy has the support of Beano
Cook, for crying out loud.

Ifhe needs help in his efforts, he’ll get
it fromthe Irish fans, his family, and the
third element of Notre Dame’s invasion ——
tradition.

Sure, laugh. Tradition at Notre Dame
has fallen from grace so fast that you’d
think Marv Albert was somehow
involved. Still, it exists — a certain aura, a
powerthat the team can draw fromintight
situations. ,

It might be religious. It could be luck.
It could be anything. But if you’ve ever
been to the Notre Dame campus, if you’ve
ever sat in a stadium with nearly 60,000
screaming fanatics, you know it exists.

If you remember the 60-6 debacle last
season at South Bend, you know it exists.
Pitt took the Irish to the limit in a scoreless
ﬁrst quarter, then watched as Notre Dame
changed gears and obliterated the Panthers
with a 40-point, second—qua1ter onslaught.

Thanks to Coach Harris, that kind of
embarrassment is nearly an impossibility.
But just because they have had a rough go
of it so far doesn’t mean the Irish are inca-
pable of ﬁnding their magic again.

“Facing those three teams will tell us if

this season,” said Ciarletta. “We don’t
know a whole lot about Shippensburg but
we understand that tl1ey’re a solid team, at
