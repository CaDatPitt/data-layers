As the 10th anniversary of the
Three Mile Island nuclear acci-
dent passes,—no significant im-
provements to deal with health

problems from radiation have

is

been made, according to Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Professor Gor-
don MacLeod.

MacLeod, of the Graduate
School of Public Health, was
Gov. Richard Thornburg’s secre-
tary of health at the time of the
accident. He said that the Penn-
sylvania state government was
unprepared to act at the time of
the accident, and little has
changed.

”The irony of the situation is
that the state government has no

jurisdiction over land used for

nuclear power plants,” MacLeod
said. ”As state employees, we

ecouldn’t go down to the plant. It

took us fivedays to get a physi-
cian at thesite because we had
to go through the federal
bureaucracy.” T ' '

According to MacLeod, there

were. no physicians in the‘

Nuclear Regulatory. Commission,
sothe organization had to locate

one in another federal agency.

the Department of Environmen—_

“The first thing I did when I heard

about the accident was to ask my
deputy to contact the Bureau of
Radioactive Health. He told me
there was no such organization:

ment and the Department of En-

the liaison had left the job six
months earlier and hadn't been

had been closedfor two years

MacLeod also said that the '

research done on the people who
were exposed to the radiation
was not sufficient to make ac-

long—term effects of radiation ex-
posure. -

Valdez harbor reopens; tanker on its way

VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) ~ A vi-
tal harbor reopened Tuesday to
tankers lined up to load North
Slope crude oil, and cleanup offi-

.-cials said they had abandoned

hope of controlling the nation’s
worst oil spill by mechanical
means.

NEWS BRIEFS

Coast Guard officials planned
to resume burning the spill to
slow the rapid spread of the
10()-square-mile ‘stain on Prince
William Sound. Only a tenth of
the 10 million gallons of oil has
been recovered by booms and
skimmers.

President Bush said at the
White House that the federal
government would consider tak-
ing over the cleanup and he sent
three top officials to Alaska ”to
take a hard look at where this dis-
aster stands."

Tea tankers led by the ARCO
Sag River were waiting to enter
port and load at the Alyeska Pipe-
line Service Co. marine terminal,
Coast Guard Lt. Ed Wieliczkie-
wicz said.

Tankertraffic was halted Friday
after the crack-up of the Exxon
Valdez, and flow through the
trans-Alaska oil pipeline had
been reduced to 80(),000 barrels
a day from 2.1 million. The ter-
minal had about 5 million barrels
of unused capacity by early
Tuesday.

Coast Guard Cmdr. Steven
McCall will decide whether to al-
low other ships to pass after see-
ing how the ARCO Sag River
negotiates the ice-choked water,
said spokesman Todd Nelson.
Tanker traffic will be limited to
daylight hours, and the huge ves-
sels will not use normal traffic
lanes so they can avoid spilled
oil.

Khomeini successor
resigns under order

NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) —-
Ayatollah Ali Montazeri resigned
on Tuesday as the heir-apparent
to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
and said he did so at the bidding
of the 88-year-old revolutionary
patriarch himself.

Montazeri was the most promi-
nent casualty so far in a fierce
drive by Khomeini to return Iran
to the roots of its fundamentalist
revolution.

Iran's U.N. ambassador, Mo-
hammad Jaafar Mahallati, also
resigned Tuesday, two days after
the deputy foreign minister, Mo-
hammad Javad Larijani, handed
in his resignation. Both were
U.S.-educated.

Khomeini last month harshly
attacked those who would
rebuild links with the West and
denounced lagging revolutionary
fervor. =

Montazeri’s resignation came
after Khomeini sent him a letter
on March 26 asking him to step
down, reported Iran's. official
Tehran radio, monitored in
Nicosia.

Sludge awards trophy
to alternate yacht

NEW YORK (AP) ~ A judge

I Tuesday disqualified the San Die-

go Yacht Club as the winner in

last year's America's Cup
challenge and awarded the inter-
national sailing trophy to the
defeated New Zealand club.
State Supreme Court Justice
Carmen Ciparick said San Diego

”violated the spirit” of the race-

by using a 60-foot catamaran to
defend against the Mercury Bay
Boating Club's single—hulled
yacht, which is about 90 feet at
the water line.

San Diego's catamaran is the
Stars and Stripes, a multi-hulled
boat that is lighter, faster and
more maneuverable than the
New Zealand.

Skippered by Dennis Conner,
the San Diego crew sailed to easy
victory over the Mercury Bay
club in waters off San Diego la
September. ‘

Calling the contest a "gross
mismatch,” the judge ordered the

138-year—old silver cup turned"

over to the New Zealanders.
Tom Mitchell, a spokesman for
San Diego, said he was surprised
by the ruling and that his group
would review the decision and
decide what action to take next.

Zia on Kos villagers leery of German tourists  

- head in disgust and turned away.

German tourists had invaded
the small mountain village of Zia
on Kos, a Greek island off the
Turkish coastline.

An island local had advised my
friend Jeff and I to visit the small,
quiet village which was located
on the top of Mt. Dikeos, one of
the highest mountains on Kos.
We couldn't resist the temptation
to visit the village when we heard
about the scenic views of the

_ Mediterranean and the Turkish
coast.

When we arrived, Jeff and I

' were disappointed to see a bus-
Ioad of fashionably dressed visi-
tors. They were sitting under the
village cafe's shaded terrace eat-
iing yogurt and honey and drink-
ing bitter coffee — the island
specialties. Others walked along
the white stony paths, peeking
into alleyways and backyards,
trying to catch glimpses of the vil-
lagers who seemed to disappear
when they" heard the “tour bus
roaring up the mountain.

We walked throughthe crowds
waiting to board the bus. Parents
shouted after children who were
trying to open the heavy lid of the
cafe’s ice cream freezer because
they were tempted by the differ-
ent pictures of ice cream bars
pasted on it. Older tourists rest-
ed against the stone walls, crush-
ing the small mountain wild

" flowers along the edges.

3 Many were attracted to the

in

_ small tourist shop which exhibit-

ed handwoven blankets and cer-
amic gifts. An old woman with a
‘ brown weathered face stood out-
side the shop, watching the Ger-

mans walk by. Around her head, _».

she wore a dark handkerchief
which matched her brown knee-
high socks. I was surprised to see
her wearing a bright floral dress
since most older women on the
island wore the customary colors
of black or brown. I waited out-

Debate-—°—  

Continued from page 1

At the tournament, each team
must debate eight times — four
times in favor of a resolution and
four times against one. The‘com-
petition starts with 32 teams and
goes through an elimination
process similar to that of the
NCAA basketball tournament.
Last year the Pitt team made it to
the final 16.

Dauber is optimistic about the
teams’ chances this year.

’’I think we have a chance to
do very, very well,” she said.

For Craver, the tournament is’
especially important because he
is a senior. _‘

”I’ve been debating eight
years. This year it is a sort of do
or die situation. If I am going to
win it, this will be my year,” he
said. '

side the shop while Jeff looked at
a handwoven blanket.

As soon as Jeff approached the
table, the old woman quickly
walked over and stood directly
behind his left elbow, trying to
open up a blanket or rug.

”NiceI Nice! Very nice!" she

I repeated as her crooked index

finger pointed at different designs
in the blanket. Jeff nodded. The
woman smiled a toothless grin
and began folding it up.
‘’‘You buy! Yes?”
demanded. *

When Jeff nodded his head,
deciding to buy a small blanket,
the old woman speedily folded it
up and disappeared inside the
building, motioning for him to
follow with the words "’Pay!
Pay!”

She came out of the shop, leav-
ing Jeff to pay the cashier inside.
She stood next to her pile of
blankets and posed for tourists as

two more times before Jeff reap-
peared carrying his purchase, and
we made our way up through the
village to the top of the mountain.
As we walked up the uneven
stone steps, I watched groups of
small children peeking out
through wooden shutters and
thick bushes lining the path. They
didn’t smile, but stared at us cu-
riously as Jeff and I dodged the
goats and chickens which
roamed through the village.

Jeff and I approached the top of
the mountain. We had passed
most of the tourists as they made
their way down the path toward
their waiting bus. A few still lin-
gered, trying to take pictures of
villagers’ backyards by standing

‘ on their toes and holding their

cameras over hedges and be-
tween trees. One young German
man was making a commotion as
he tried to take a aicture of an

    
 
 
      
   
   
   
     

older villager sitting in his side-
yard sunning himself. The tourist
shouted, waving his camera at
the man, who quietly ignored
him. '
An old village woman by the’
sideyard stopped scrubbing her
laundry in the trough of running
spring water along the mountain
path and watched the tourist try
to take a picture. She looked on
in a tired silence as the young
man failed to take the picture,
crushing a group of flowers in the
process. '
When the German man saw
the old woman with her laundry,
he smiled and pointed to her,
then to his camera. She shook her

The German stuck his tongue out
at her and then snapped a picture
of her back as she hunched over
the water again."

As we stood looking over the
crystal blue Mediterranean, I
thought of theold woman at the
tourist shop and compared her
reaction to the tourists to that of
the woman doing laundry.

I wondered if they were
friends, if they grew up together
in the small" mountain village'-
and as we descended_ the path
through the village once. again, I
wondered if the tourist shop
woman had ever been an
"authentic" villager.

The SGB’s spending

The student activities fee accounts for $32 of every
full--time student's tuition at the University of Pittsburgh.
This fee pays for Student Government Board, Pitt Pro-
gram Council and other activities. So far, so good.

Some of the surplus funding amassed by the collec-
tion of this fee goes into a fund called the Student Ac-
tivities Capital and Program Reserve —— again, nothing
amiss here.

This reserve is used for projects that the SGB may
want to fund. For instance, the neon sculpture that
graces a wall of the William Pitt Union was funded from
this account, at a cost of about $30,000. Here we find
ourselves moving into doubtful territory. But art is sub-
jective. It was a beautification project. It still falls, just
barely, within the realm of acceptability.

A few years ago, the reserve account was used to buy
a bench for the Fifth and Bigelow bus stop. Sound nice?
That bench cost about $12,000, and was made of im-
ported African wood. Still sound nice?

There seems to have been some excess exhibited in
past years by SGBs that apparently couldn't think of
worthwhile things to spend their money on. So how
is the current administration planning to use the approx-
imately $42,000 currently sitting in the reserve account?
When asked about the reserve account, this is what Kent
Baldauf had to say:

”What the hell is that? Oh, that must be the 80 grand
we've got tucked away somewhere. I'm not really sure.
I think they use it for stuff like theneon sculpture. I only
know about stuff like that from what they tell me sec-
ond hand.”

These were the words of the only man who present-
ed himself as a candidate for the office of president of
the Student Government Board. At least the Duquesne
Student Government Association president, Happy
Meltzer, for all his other problems, kept an eagle's eye
on where the money was. r

And so $42,000 sits in an account, administered by

_ the SGB, and the SGB president doesn't even know
‘what it is. This is definitely not good.

Asa community, we at Pitt have a very strong ten-
dency to discount the SGB as being an unimportant or-
ganization. This is evidenced in the low voter turnout
at SGB elections, and, as noted above, the lack of a
choice of candidates for president. But these people
have control of our money. Next year, SGB will be al-
locating $395,815 of our money (not counting the
reserve account). This is a matter worthy of our atten-
tion as students. .

’ $42,000 is enough to fund a four-year scholarship.
It is enough to pay for two or three prominent speak-
A ers. It is enough money that there should be some con-
cern toward spending it on something that the students
want, rather than letting it sit in a bank account, serv-
ing little purpose.,At this rate, by the time it is spent,
the students whose money was deposited into it will ‘
have long graduated. They will never receive the serv-
ices that they contracted with the university, by paying
their student activities fee. But maybe, somewhere down "
M the line, future Pitt students will get a nice bench, made
of imported African wood, on whichjto rest their weary
bodies. _. ' —  .3 1 . . ~ . ' T

The debate on who should
own guns and who shouldn't is
not going to go away tomorrow.
It's becoming very emotional,
and George Bushwould like us
all to calm down and not throw
the baby out with the AK-47‘.
The thing we must do is look at
both sides of the argument, and
then make our_ decision on
whether banning guns is a plus or
a minus for the country.

ART
BUCHWALD

I am prepared to make my alr-
guments for guns, and leave it to
some bleeding heart liberal to

V give the other side.

Here is why you should bite
the bullet...

President Bush enjoys hunting
and has been using guns all his
life.

The main source of food in this
country is provided by hunters. If
you took their guns away, the
people of America would starve
to death. .

Matt Martin's Belie

First it was handgun control.
Next came the‘ disputed use of
AK-47 assault rifles.

Now, with only two weeks re-
maining before the opening day
of trout season in Pennsylvania,
Comes the most important step of
all —— the banning of fishing rods.

That's right. Those poor,
defenseless fish are again about
to be attacked by a multitude of
Berkeleys, Brownings, Daiwas...
and let's not forget the Ugly Stick.

Pitt's own ubiquitous Jay Katz
is leading the pro—trout troops in
their battle against the evil empire
of fishermen.

Katz, who is ubiquitous, is also
president of the Student Action
..Union and a contributor to the
”Free University Press"~ at Pitt
and has become a fixture in ral-
lies for the homeless in the Pitts-
burgharea.

Apparently, the omnipresent
Katz likens the plight of the rain-
bow, brook and palimino trout to
that of the homeless, in some-
‘what of a reverse fashion.

The Katz Foundation for Free

area before opening day. Should
any money remain, he'will begin
combing the same area for any
remaining nightcrawlers, craw-
dads or live minnows that have
yet to be purchased by the tyran-
nical anglers.

To date, Katz has comman-
deered a Zebco 303 pole and reel
from a hardware store in Kit-

The importance of giving support to the Contra rebels

On March 18, a march down
Fifth and Forbes Avenues was
conducted by a group of univer-
sity leftists.

Their original purpose was to
protest US. government interven-
tion in El Salvador, but, of course,
it went further than that.

° PAUL G.
KENGOR

The shouting that alarmed me
was the slogan, "Down with the
Contras; up with the people!”
This statement illustrates the in-
conclusiveness of liberal ideolo-
gy. In essence, it suggests that

‘ these protesters oppose U.S. aid
to the Contras. However, as so

5' often is the case, their caprice that

the U.S. government cease aid to
the Contras would only backfire
in its good intentions if carried
out. ' ~ '
'Personally, I'm appalled by the
fact that so many people argue
against Contra aid. V\/hy? Well,
first let's establish what the inten-
gtions of Contra aid are: '

land apartment on Easter to dis-

My skin became clammy and
my mouth was dry as I stood in
front of the small circle of com-
plete strangers and said,"Hi.A My
name is Mark,‘ and I am a
procrastinator." Everyone in the
small, dank room applauded, and
I felt choked. up as-I held in my
tears. It was my first Procras-

Contra aid was started by the
Reagan administration and is one
of the utmost priorities of the
Bush administration. Its purpose
is to provide the Nicaraguan
freedom—fighting guerrillas (the
Contras) with whatever is neces-
sary to remove their Marxist San-
dinistan government from power.
The Contras don't want a com-
munist government, and we're
helping them. ‘ *

Why would liberals oppose
this pursuit of freedom? Maybe
they're just confused and need
proof of the effectiveness of this
type of assistance — so, how
about this one? In 1947, Presi-
dent Truman enacted the Truman
Doctrine. This doctrine provided
$400 million in aid to Greece
and Turkey, in order to strength-
en them in the event of a possi-
ble Soviet invasion. As a result of

"our assistance, these nations‘sur-

vived that scarezand have en-
joyed freedom. Of course, these
countries weren’t fighting their
own governments, but they were
combating communism.
Another example: Through the

things on the floor when she got
back. A

I walked into the living room
and found it completely ran-
sacked. The couch cushions were
thrown across the room. Drawers
were pulledrout, and their con-
tents were scattered all ovef the
floor. The television was gone.

My stereo was gone. The
microwave was gone. My room-
mate was missing a telephone
and answering machine, a
camera, a walkman and a gold
bracelet.

Needless to say, we'd been‘

robbed.

The police arrived and I filed a
report. They naturally assured my
roommate and me that we would
"never see any of that stuff
again.” ’ -

After cleaning up most of the
mess, we sat around for therest
of the evening, afraid to go to
sleep, mulling over our parents’

comments — "Welcome to the

real world." We tried to feel bet-
ter by joking that we'd probably

me, only to find that I was not

cleaning, but doing things like '

stapling the cat to the dog, Morse-
coding profanities out of the win-
dow with my bedside lamp, glu-
ing my toenail clippings to the

A ceiling, beating the crap out of

my imaginary friend and a varie-

ty of other things. Back then, my '

mother would get very upset and
would‘ say, '_’Mike, Matt, I mean
Mark, you had better stop

procrastinating. Someday it is go- '

ing to catch up with you.’ I
laughed it off then, but now I am

' out of control. Now I realize that

I've got a serious procrastination
problem." -

When’! left that P.A. meeting,
I felt like a new man. And ever
since, I have made progress. For
instance, I no longer feel that it
is necessary to have-all of my

first five years of the war between
the Soviets and Afghanistan, the
Reagan administration pumped
$625 million in aid to the
freedom—fighting Afghans. This
helped lead to an eventual Af-
ghanistan victory and a humiliat-
ing withdrawal by the Soviets.

In contrast, perhaps the oppo-
sition would like for us to follow
the policies of past administra-
tions and start sending troops to
help the rebels in their fight for
democracy. Sorry, but I don't
think American citizens want
another Vietnam. We've already
been involved in two major-mili-
tary conflicts to stop the spread of
communism; let's do our best to
avoid another.

What if the U.S. government
took the advice of the protesters
and abandoned our aid to the
Contras? This would lead to a
forced surrender by the Contras,
and as a result", communism
would prevail in a country that
had a shot at democracy. Further.-
more, this could lead to a perma-
nent expansion of communism
throughout Central America and

become exceptional conversa-
tionalists without a television,
stereo or.any other distractions.

But it was useless. We felt
lousy. It took about a halfan hour
to get over the loss of our things.
The hard. part vrtasaccepting the

facfthat someone could enter our.-

apartment at any time, rummage
through our things and take
whatever he wanted. And there
are intruders far worse than
thieves. .

We called the landlady to re-
quest new Iocks, but to say that
she was less than helpful’ would
be a masterpiece of understate-
ment. After arguing at great
length with my roommates
mother, our landlady said she
would have a new lock installed
eventually. We offered to put one
in ourselves and deduct the cost
from the rent, but she refused.
(Journalistic ethics prohibit me
from printingthis woman's name,
but if you give me a call, I'd be
glad to let you know. Trust me,
you don't care to rent from her.)

me get to work or class on time.
I now know that it is a losing
game. Soon, five minutes wasn't

enough, and ll would need to

have things set 10 minutesahead. »

Then, 10 minutes wouldn't be
enough, and I'd be doing 20, 30
minutes. Next thing I'd know, I'd
be completely out of control as
I'd suddenly slip into California's
time zone. « '

' vz

Although I've beaten what’

procrastinologists refer to as

“Time-Wa_rp Facade Syndrome,"' .

I am still caught up with other
aspects of procrastination. For in-
stance, I cannot beat what the
doctors call, ”Partying and Sleep-
Instead of Studying
Phenomenon.”

perhaps farther. This would hurt
U.S. trade with these nations and
thus our economy — then we all
would have something to com-
plain about. Is this what the pro-
testers want? _
Additionally, if Nicaragua,re-
mains communist, there's always
a possibility that the Soviet Un-
ion -may install military bases
there. Cuba is a perfect example

of the credibility of that hypothe-

sis. You argue that the modern
Soviet government would never
do something so detrimental? Ask
the Afghans if they agree. (A few
footnotes: the Sandinistas were
provided with aid from Moscow
and Cuba during their initial over-
throw of the T979 Nicaraguan
dictator, Somoza. Also, the Soviet
Union is annually providing
$300 million in military aid to the
Sandinista government.)

Has our aid to the freedom

_ fighters helped? The Bush ad-

ministration and Congress are
close to their goal of the volun-
tary re-integration of the Contras
into Nicaraguan society "under
safe and democratic conditions."

The following morning, some
sort of custodian arrived to take
a look at the locks.

"What's wrong wi_th these
locks?" he asked my brother,
who was visiting. I

The Nicaraguan government, in
a Feb. 15 peace accord,’ has
agreed to seek democratic
changes and have free elections.
in I990. Also, the government
has agreed to release 3,300 im-

In summary, the U.S. support
for the Nicaraguan freedom fight-
ers has been a fine idea which ap-
pears to be working successfully.
Two hundred years from now,-
when Nicaraguans are pledging
their flag of democracy, they'll be
shocked that there were actually
trials and protests in the United.
States against our supporting their -
quest for freedom. Consequently,
in Nicaraguan history books,
I’residentsReagan and Bush, and
especially Col. Oliver North, will
be recognized for assisting in the
revolution which saved their
country from communism.
Perhaps our protesters should
consider some of this before

number of babies born with seri-
ous thyroid problems,” as the
anti-nuclear power group Three
Mile Island Alert, Inc. asserts.

”The governor told me it was
because of a ‘difference in institu-
tional styles.’ He referred to the
fact that I had expressed concerns
that some of the informationwas
incorrect to Secretary of Environ-
mental Resources Clifford Jones.

”Jones _ became angry and
defended his people. Some might
call it a cover up, but I just saw
someone who couldn't take
criticism.’’ '

He added that the thyroid
studies were not released until af-
ter he had left office.

MacLeod has since lectured all
over ‘the world about his con-
cerns for' safety in the nuclear
age. He talked to people in India
after the Union Carbide chemical

accident and spoke to four Soviet
physicians after the Chernobyl
nuclear incident. The Soviets told
him that potassium iodide, an an-
tidote for radiation poisoning of
the thyroid gland, was available
at Chernobyl because Soviets had
learned of his efforts to make it
available in the United States.

MacLeod said that he has three
reforms he feels are necessary for
nuclear power plants:

0 The availability of potassium
iodide at all of the nuclear pow-
er plants in the United States. In
some states, this has already hap-
pened. Pennsylvania is not one of
them. »

0 That one of the three NRC
commission'ers be a physician so
that medical concerns about radi-
ation are addressed. Currently, all

llTl’€€ commissioners -are en-‘

gineers.

’’I would like to make it clear

that I am not opposed to nuclear

power,” MacLeod said. ’’I see it
as potentially safer than fossil
fuels. I'd just like to have more
health input before we develop _
it further.

”The engineers are good. I'm
not belittling them. But the med-
ical field currently has little
input”

MacLeod compares nuclear
power to experimental drugs or
medical techniques.

”By law, in order to have a
doctor perform an experimental
procedure or use an experimen-
tal drug on you, he must have
your consent. I feel the same
should be true for nuclear power
plants," he said.

”Nuclear plants are also ex-
perimental. We don’t know the
full effects of radiation yet. I feel
we s_houId inform the public be--

ponent of the larger universi-
ty,” said Pitt President Wesley
W. Posvar. ’’In Dublin, we"
shall be representing Pitt as a
great academic institution with v
a powerful international
dimension‘."’

Pitt head coach Mike Gott-
fried added, ”We are very
pleased to have a chance to
take our football team to Dub-
lin to play against Rutgers...It
will be something for our play- ‘
ers to look forward to through-
out the 1989 season, and I

St._ Louis, _St.
WI” meet in

By Rick Warner

AP Sports Writer

NEW YORK —- All Saints’ Day
is coming early this year.

St. John's and St. Louis, Cathol-
ic schools with proud basketball
traditions, meet Wednesday night
for the championship of the Na-
tional lnvitation Tournament at
Madison Square Garden.

St. lohn’s is playing in its 25th
NIT and St. Louis is appearing for
the 14th time, but it has been
years since either school won the
championship of the country's ol-
dest postseason tournament.

”Easy” Ed Macauley led St.
Louis to its only NIT title in 1948.
St. John's won the last of its four
NIT championships in 1965.

”Tradition is good for histori-
ans,” St. John's‘ Coach Lou Car-
nesecca said Tuesday, ”but it
won't help us tomorrow night.”

St. lohn’.s, 19-13, reached its
low point after losing to last-place
Boston College in the game to de-
termine the last berth in the Big
East tournament. But the Redmen
have rebounded with four victo-
ries in the NIT, including a 76-65
semifinal win over Alabama-
Birmingham on Monday night.

”|t was very depressing after
the BC game,” Carnesecca said.

    

   GR

The Test Is When?

"A lot of people thought we were
dead, but we stuck with it and
we’re still playing.”

Because they start three fresh-
men - guard Jason Buchanan,
forward Malik Sealy and center
Robert Werdann — the Redmen
are considered a team of the fu-
ture. But Carnesecca would
rather talk about today than
tomorrow.

”The future is now,” he said,
echoing the phrase made famous
by George Allen. ”You never
know what's going to happen in
a year or two. You've got to grab
it while you can.”

St. Louis, 27-9, reached the
championship game by beating
Michigan State 74-64.

”We may be a surprise team to
a lot of people around the coun-
try, but we felt we were pretty
good all along,” Billikens Coach
Rich Grawer said.

"It's kind of mind-boggling, but
someone told me there's only 10
teams in the country with 27 wins
or more, and we're one of them.”

Despite their record, the Bil-
likens didn’t get much national
publicity until they arrived in
New York.

CLEARWATER, Fla. — It
went down to the last tendon
in order for catcher Darren
Daulton to clinch a platoon
role with the Philadelphia
Phillies.

General Manager Lee Tho-
mas and Manager Nick Leyva
said Daulton just edged Tom
Nieto in the spring training
competition for two catching
jobs.

Leyva left the impression he
might have gone with Nieto if
the catcher hadn't suffered a
throwing hand injury.

Nieto is headed for the Phil-
lies’ Triple A farm at Scranton-
Wilkes-Barre, where he'll be
insurance against injury to
Daulton or his platoon mate,
Steve Lake.

Daulton, 27, admits that he
never envisioned a struggle for
a catching job. He came to
camp assured that he had it
made.

’’I was told to come to
spring training and not worry
about anything,” he recalled.
”Just get ready to play the sea-
son. Relax and play ball. Don't
put any undue pressure on

Daulton catches on
as Phillies reserve

yourself. Have a good spring.”

But Daulton, who has spent
an injury-spotted four years
with the Phillies, found that
the Thomas—Ley\'i spring
camp was not laced with com-
placency.

Lake, who came from
St.Louis in the trade for Milt
Thompson, and Nieto, ac-
quired in a deal that brought
second baseman Tom Herr,
battled Daulton to the end.

The thing that may have
tipped things in Daulton’s
favor, even after the hand in-
jury was weighted, is that
Daulton is a left-handed hitter.
The Phillies need left-handed

- hitters. Nieto is a right—handed

hitter.

Daulton had already placed
himself in a win or out of the
game situation by taking a
strong stand against minor
league assignments.

”That’s completely out,” he
said before a camp game. ”l
will not return to the minor
leagues...There is no reason

_for me to go to the minors.”

He started 1987 in the
minors, was recalled and
played in 53 games with the

Phillies, hitting .198.

Sutter admits career may be over

By Tom Saladino

AP Sports Writer

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.-
Bruce Sutter admitted Tuesday
that his chances of ever pitching
again are remote because of a se-
verely torn rotator cuff. But the
former king of the bullpen still is
not ready to announce his
retirement.

Sutter, who last year became
only the third relief pitcher in
baseball history to record 300
saves, was told Monday by
Braves’ physicians that the rota-
tor cuff in his right shoulder was
torn badly.

’’I wouldn't anticipate that he
would play any more baseball,”
said team physician Dr. Robert
Wells after being shown results of
the examination.

”There’s probably a 99.9 per-
cent chance I won't be able to

pitch again,” Sutter told a hastily '

called news conference at the
Braves" training camp. He
returned to West Palm Beach
Tuesday morning from Atlanta,

   

iuiciilsi‘

where he was examined Sunday
by another Braves physician, Dr.
Joe Chandler.

Sutter said he would rest his
arm for three to four months and
then decide whether to undergo
surgery on the shoulder, which
had been operated on three times
previously.

”Dr. Chandler found a rotator
cuff tear —- a pretty good-sized
tear — and he thinks Bruce
should do nothing for three to
four months,” said General
Manager Bobby Cox. ”We’ll look
at it then and see if it needs to be

cut on and go from there. .We '

don’t expect Bruce to pitch this
yean _

”Bruce is not going to retire,”
Cox said. ”We’re not going to
release him. We'll put him on the
21-day disabled list, then proba-
bly move him to the 60-day DL
later on.” ‘ '

Sutter, who signed a $10.6 mil-
lion, 6-year contract with the

”l don't feel too good right
now,” said Sutter, 36, who met
with Cox and team president Stan
Kasten for about 15 minutes be-
fore answering questions from
the media. .

’’It was a long, hard fight to try
to get back,” he said. ’’I felt good
at the beginning of the spring, but
about two to three weeks ago it
started hurti_r),g and it gradually
got worse and worse.

’’It got to a point that I had to

in his 13th season in the major

”l tried to throw as long as I

(AP) — North Schuylkil|’s
three PIAA Class AA state
champions — Chris Rickard,
Randy‘ Reidler and Mark
Cesari — will wrestle for the
Pennsylvania team in Satur-
day's Pittsburgh Press
Wrestling Classic.

The Pennsylvania team,
which includes no Pittsburgh-
area wrestlers, will face a U.S.
all-star team in the 15th annu-
al match at the University of
Pittsburgh.

Cesari, a two-time PIAA
champion with a 138-8 career
record, will become the se-
cond Cesari brother to wrestle
in the Classic. Joe Cesari, the
son of Spartans coach Joe
Cesari, wrestled in the 1984
match.

Proposition 48:

Editor's Note: Proposition 48
was intended to smooth the road
to an athlete's college education.
Instead, in its third year, the
NCAA ’s controversial rule is an

‘obstacle that affects blacks most

enrolled in school and found that
58 of 60 Prop 485 were black in
1987-88 and 80 of 90 were black
in 1986-87.

That's an even higher percen-
tage than the NCAA found in all
sports combined, with blacks six
times as likely as whites to fail
Prop 48 standards. That 1987-88
study showed one in seven black
recruits was a Prop 48, compared
with one in 45 whites.

school year.

”lt’s a disappointing maldistri-
bution of disqualifiers,” said
James Zumberge, president of the
University of Southern California
and one of the Prop 48 founders.

Nevertheless, he said the num-
bers indicate that too many
recruits ”were totally unequipped
for any college work beyond the

test courses? is it because they're
taking Mickey Mouse courses
and not really getting any educa-
tions?” she said.

Damon Patterson, a reserve for-
ward at Oklahoma, is one Prop

‘48 who made a dramatic turn-

around. After sitting out the
1987-88 season, he had a 3.13
grade—point average on a scale of
4.0 and was named to this sea-
son's Big Eight all-academic

third, and Sierra capped a three-
run rally in the fifth with his home
run.

Sierra is two home runs short
of the Rangers’ spring record of
seven by Pete lncaviglia in 1986.

The Rangers on Tuesday sent
pitcher Mike Jeffcoat to the
minor-league camp for re-
assignment. That ‘move, along
with three roster moves earlier in
the day, leaves the Rangers with
27 players on their spring roster.

Earlier, the Rangers released

vited player in the big-league

with his spring performance.

’’I don't think camp has
been all that bad for me,” he
said. ’’I’m swinging the bat
pretty well. I feel healthy. I'm
ready to catch every day. I
couldn't feel better.”

Health is also most in the
minds of Thomas and Leyva
when they evaluate their deci-
sion to keep him. His past his-
tory includes:

° Losing most of the 1984
season with a shoulder injury.

0 Missing half of the 1985
season with the shoulder
problem. _

0 Starting the 1986 season
as the Phillies’ starting catch-
er, taking a blow on the knee
in June, undergoing surgery
and missing the nest of the
season.

Last season, as backup to
Lance Parrish, he was in 58
games and hi_t .208. He missed
the last month after breaking

wall in anger after striking out.
Parrish since has been traded.

ing ball again.

”This is my time."

Because of the knee injury,
suffered in a collision at home
plate, Thomas and Leyva are
accutely interested in Daul-
ton’s reactions blocking the
plate.

Leyva says this facet of a
catcher’s game is very impor-
tant but not fatal.

”A lot of such plays make or

break a game,” the manager
said. -
Leyva said that there have
been a couple of plays at the
plate on which Daulton wasn't
aggressive.

”He’s got to show that he
can do that,” L_evya said.

Daulton said blocking the
plate is no ”big issue. I've
been in a couple of plays here

where I could have mixed it-

up.”

But, he said, ’’I'm not going
to” because ’’I don't want to
get hurt and have to end my
career over something like

that.

’’I think I would be more
valuable to the team staying
healthy and playing the next
10-15 years of baseball, rather
than getting hurt on one play."
