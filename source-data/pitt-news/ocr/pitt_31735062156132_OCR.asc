Panthers Favored y 3

Touchdowns Over 

By Russ FRANKE »

The biggest ground gainer tabbed for action tomorrow
at the Stadium is a West Virg.inian,,but Panther partisans
needn’tfear, for he’ll be wearing the familiar Blue—and—

Gold.

Billy Reynolds, currently pac-
ing the ball-carriers with an av-
erage of 6.3 yards per try, hails
from St. Marys, W. Va.,’ but is
expected to show no mercy to-
wards his fellow countrymen as
the senior- right halfback and his
teammates go after their fourth
victory of the season.

Johnny is gaily Whistling, A
Happy Tune. as he notices’ that

June Is Busting Out All Overﬁ

To the strains of this tune, the

band will break formation and

_form a ﬂower pot, ﬁrstvempty

then with ﬂowers in it.

The ﬂower pot leads J ohnny' to
Falling In Love With, Love, and
the band forms a heart pierced
by the traditional arrow as
Johnny jumps iiito Oh, You
Beautiful Doll. '

The band here does some waltz
steps and forms stick ﬁgures of
Johnny and his girl. He asks her,
Shall We Dance? and the band

does a dance step to the lyric .

song. Finally Johnny ends a per-
fect evening by Walkin’ His

Offensive Mights of West Virginia Line

 

tioli’s .630 passing average, and

,Fullback Paul Chess’ recent ﬁne

showing are sutﬁcient offensive
grounds to rate Pitt a three
touchdown favorite over. the
Southern Conference visitors.

30.000 On Hand

An estimated crowd of 30,000
will be on hand to view the
clash at 2 p.m., one of the largest
to take in the annual aﬂfair.

Coach Red Dawson, always
fearful ofa letdown, spent a busy
week working replacements into
his lineup to keep the squad in
the best possible shape until
the swollen injury list returns to
normal. '

Defensive backs Henry Ford,
Ray Ferguson, and Bob Wrabley
are all getting a crack at offen-
sive duty, with Ford scheduled
to start at 1eft“?‘half. Wrabley, a
170 pound sophomore, may be
used to spell Reynolds at half-
back while Ferguson is ready to
back up Chess and Bobby Epps,
who is recovering from a bad leg.

way back into Line Coach Bob
Friedlund’s forward wall. Merle
DeLuca, manning the other
guard spot, and Tackles Lou
Palatella and Eldred Kraemer
are slated for both offense and
defense.

Defense Coach John Michelo-
sen has been occupied withpthe
task, of smoothing out the de-
fensive battery which allowed
Army to stage a comeback in the
ﬁnal quarter Saturday.

As for the Mountaineers, their
offense is centered around Quar-
terback. Freddy Wyant, Half-
back Eddie Dugan. and End Paul
Bischofl, who may see limited
action due to an injury incurred
in last week’s victory over
Washington & Lee.

Bischoff has caught 12 passes
but has yet to score a TD, al-
th0U£,’h his. yardage totals more
than any Pitt receiver.

_So far, Coach Art Lewis’ Mor-
gantowners have chalked up two
wins and two losses and, al-
though made up largely of rook-
ies, are expected to be "up” for
tomorrow‘s contest.

Schmidt Still Out

At least their runners will not
have to face the Panthers’ star
linebacker, Captain Joe Schmidt,
who will be on the sidelines in-
definitely. Dawson does not
choose to take a chance on the
blond s'enior’s head, injury until
the doctors give the okay.

By now, Dawson should
used to working -with a short-
handed squad, and has proved
his team can win in spite of it.

For this the reserved red-
head refuses to take credit. When
congfatulated on being named
as Coach of the‘Week following
the Army win, he explained,
“That’s what comes of having a
good coaching staff and a ﬁne
bunch of boys, I guess."

 IH Serum
CPitt’si Dr. H ammon Directed
F ieldTests on 55,000 Victims

 

  

October’ 24, A 1952

By BARBARA SCH“’ARTZ
Pitt’s /Dr. William McD. Hammon has succeeded in ﬁnd-
ing a serum which is effective in preventing human paraly-
tic polio, it was announced Wednesday.

It is the ﬁrst time a material has been scientiﬁcall
proved to work in combatting the¢- _ _ _ a : ‘  a

deadly paralysis. The_announce—
ment of the discovery was made
by Dr. Hammon at the annual

meeting of the American Public *
, Health Association. '

Results of a human polio ﬁeld
test involving_ 55,000 children in
-epidemic areas show that injec-
tions of’ gamma globulin contain-
ing anti-bodies against the three
known polio viruses gave _marked

protection against paralytic polio _
-3"

for at least ﬁve weeks. .
Red,Cross Aids Trials

The gamma globulin used in the 

trials, the largest ever conducted
in ﬁeld history, was‘ furnished by
the American National Red Cross.
‘It was prepared from. blood col-
lected during World War II years
from thousands of blood donors in
diiferent areas of the country.
Three viruses cause human po-

lio;. they are known as‘ Brunhilde, ~
‘ Lansing and Leon types. Infection

by one will not lead to"immunity
against either of the other two but
gamma globulin was proved ef-
fective against all three types.

_ Controls Used

In the test, half of the 55,000
children were injected with gam-
ma globulin. Tthe other halfwere

_injected with, similar-appearing

gelatin, known to be harmless and
without beneﬁcial effects. The
latter group, served as ‘controls
against which the eﬁectiveness of
gamma globulin could be meas-
ured.

During the ﬁrst week-following
the gamma globulin injections,
there was little protection ob-
served. Nearly as many polio
cases occurred in the gamma glo-

bulin group during this ﬁrst week

as occurred in the control series.
However, the cases were mild and

within 30 days half had complete-_

ly recovered as compared to none
in the control group.
' _ Results Good

In the second week, a sharp rise
in protection occurred in the gam-
ma globulin group and vgas main-
tained through the ﬁfth week, ac-
cording to Dr.‘ Hammon.

The most important factor yet
to. be determined, Dr. Hammon

Prof’s Story

has accepted a story, The
Desperate Comedians, by
Lawrence.Lee, associate pro"-'
fessor of English at Pitt.

Charactersin the story, accord-
ing to Mr. Lee, are entirely ﬁc-
tional. They are a mother, father
and daughter who constitute the
"cast of a play, touring remote
areas of the south, and-a village
boy a few years older than the
girl.

“The essence of the story,” Mr.
Lee says, “is the loneliness ‘of hu-
man beings in general and the
loneliness of actors in particular.”

“Interdependence of People”

, The tale itself is concerned with
the results which follow the ap-
pearance of these actors in a small
Alabama town and with their
evening of illusion in this lonely
provincial town. “In effect,” Mr.
Lee summarizes, "‘the story deals
with the interdependence of peo-
ple.”

Drama of the story had its germ.
'in a medicine show which enter-
tained a country crowd from a
platform rigged up in front of a
corner drug store in the author’s
home town in Alabama.

Well-known Author

.'Previously, Mr. Lee‘ had three
volumes of poetry. published .-by
Charles Scribbner, and several
short stories published in The Yir-
ginia Quarterly Review and other
magazines of specialized circula-
tion.

His short stories have been men-
tioned in the introductions of 0.

, other parts of the Martha -Foley

‘for not,’ doing this, the most: logical being that we

have no choice. _ . _
We ‘are, howevekr-, presenting below the views of I
the two editorial factions concerning their own in-

"dividual choices. In next week’s issue, Dan Purdy

and Ross Reese, who head up the two opposing po-
litical-camps at Pitt, will occupy this same space
for presenting their arguments in behalf of Eisen-

remnants of the name everyone
expects the old Panther.”

gone 'from_ one extreme ‘to the‘

other;- It has nothing much that
anyonewould want to read.”_

is at least accomplishing its aim of
showing the student side of life.”

games. The entire left side of the"

line, from left end to center, Cap-
tain Paul’Bischoff, Ben Dunkerley,
Phil Canton and Chuck Donaldson
are natives of the Keystone state.
Right End Bill Marker and Half-
back.Eddie Dugan, both offensive
threats have left their home state
for .West Virginia.

A Bischoﬁ Top Mounty

Bischoff, an All-American candi-
date from Beaver Falls, is de-
scribed as,-the best pass receiver,
tackler, blocker and runner on
the squad. A 60-minute ‘man,
Bischoff assumes the role of safety
man on ‘the’ defensive platoon.

After setting the Eastern Intercol-

legiate record for pass catching last
season, he has accounted for over
half of the Mountaineers pass com-
pletion total this year.

Marker, from Uniontown, who ~
along with Bischoﬁ has been la-
beled by Coach Art Lewis as the’
“ﬁnest pair of ends in the country," .
is the Mountaineers’ leading scorer.
He will see both offensive and de-
fensive action in tomorrow’s game.

Glassport’s gift to West Virginia
is 225-pound Tackle Ben Dunker-
ley, who played. a tremendous
game against the Panthers last
year. He was selected on the all-‘
Pitt Stadimn eleven last year for
his- Gibralter-like performance on
defense. ,

Dugan, a ﬂash, has averaged'12.3‘ 1,;
yards per carry this season. Only 
a freshman, Dugan beat out two,
regulars for the _post and has
turned in some spectacular runs
including a’ 90-yard sprint against
Waynesburg.

Center Chuck Donaldson from

gridder in the Mountaineer lineup. 
He has been a standout linebacker “
the past four Saturdays.

Ari Lewis Tries 
Ancient Trick

By BORIS WEIN STEIN
Sports Editor

  
 
      

 

-nr. .

 

West Virginia Coach Art Lewis, a clever coach who be-
lieves. in starting from scratch and building skyward," has,
nevertheless, stooped to an old-fashioned stunt.

‘Lewis’ originality stems from. the fact that his varsity
squad is probably one of the youngest teams in the nation.
Only Paul Bischoif, an end, will graduate from this year’s
team. Every A'Mounty has the _  .

Lewis touch and when his team 
ﬁnally attains a high national
ranking it will have his patent.

,_ But it’s in his strategy that
the young pilot retreats to foot-
ball’ ancestry. ’

The trick that Lewis has bor-
rowed, though, hasn’t alarmed
the’. Panthers at all. At the same
time, C3ach Red Dawson contin- ' C ' ' U »

 

'~u.es to ‘regard’ the Mounties as a potential threat _in .the traditional

rivalry.

Panthers by Four TD’s
5 Dawson, a clever coach, ﬂtoo,'_has been ﬁghting opposing coaching
tear for tear each week since the season -began. The crying towel
belongs to the aRedhead just as much as Lewis. 4 “‘
Reports circulated from the Mounty camp indicate that Pitt
shouldjwin by at least four touchdowns. In fact, “anything short,”
a_' .West Virginia release states, “would constitute a moral victory
for the Mountaineers.” -  V '
"The reason, if true,‘ is justiﬁed. But it’s ‘hard to believe that ﬁve
‘of seven offensive linemen are,‘ benched with football -pains. Oppos-

-q

. ing oﬂicials also doubt whether their ace ball-carrier, safety man. and

a- couple others” will see "action at the Stadium tomorrow; "

(.

New Twist Tomorrow »_ , ~  .
There’s another twist to the _Pitt—WVU game? Unlike the two

previous years when .Pitt welcomed the foe for its ﬁrst grid win, -
‘ down one of IE Tom Dillias’ pass-

the Panthers are eyeing their fourth.

The chant “Welcome Mountaineers” hasn’t echoed in the Ca-
thedral halls this week, and after tomorrow’s game, rooters won’t
be hoping the Mounties "stay around longer. They once did, you
know. * '
