Traditional Ceremony

The award, made to honor note-
worthy juniors, grew out of a former
tradition in which each graduating
class passed on a large wooden
spoon to the junior class as a re-
minder that college students should
need no ‘spoon-fed discipline.’

The spoon was originally pre-
sented by a former Chancellor as
a warning to a particularly ram-
bunctious senior class.
