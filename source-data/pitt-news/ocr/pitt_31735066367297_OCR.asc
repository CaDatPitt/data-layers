Unique Structure
Expected to House
Nearly 1,868 Men

By JOANNE DOLINAR

The University’s unique $13
million circular-tower dormi-
tory should be ready for oc-
cupancy in the Fall of 1962.
The building will house 1,868
men.

The three-towered building will
be located facing Fifth Ave.,
bound by Bouquet St. and the
Schenley Quadrangle. There will
be a common base of three floors
joining three towers.

Deeter & Ritchey, designers of

decided upon the unique cylin-

drical shape for several reasons. 

Space Used
First, it provides for maximum
utilization of space within each
building. Second, it permits more
open space between structures on
the limited site available; Third,
the circular floor area allows effi-
cient, economical arrangement of
partitions for rapid conversion of
rooms to either single or double
occupancy as dictated by enroll-
ment or other factors.
The largest of the structures
will be 21 stories, and will house
‘ 767 undergraduates. An 18 story
tower will be occupied by 666
men. Bedrooms in these two
towers will be double rooms.
The 15 story structure will house
435 graduate students in single
rooms. All rooms will be air-
conditioned. -

Dorms Divided

The undergraduate dormitories
will be divided in “houses" of
three stories, each comprised of
110 students and a couselor. Thus
one tower will contain six houses
and theother, seven. ,

The diameter of the'building
will be 88 feet. The bedrooms
will be 115 square feet for 3

William Ruhe to Assume
Executive A. M. A. Post

By TRUDY VVEISS
Dr. C. H. William Ruhe, associate dean of the School of

Medicine, has been appointed

to a position with the Amer-

ican Medical Association at AMA headquarters in Chicago.
As of Nov. 1, he will serve as assistant secretarv to the Coun-

cil on Medical Education and

Hospitals.

In this capacity, Dr. Ruhe will be helping to determine

the needs for graduate education-%

in medicine and to develop such
a program.

“The AMA feels it has a re-
sponsibility to the public of being
able to guarantee that any prac-
ticing physician is competent,"

said Dr. Ruhe. “We will try to,

e n c o u r a g e existing medical
schools and hospitals to/develop
programs to meet the need of edu-
cating physicians to the ways of
modern developments in the ﬁeld
of medicine.”
Project Entails Evaluation

The project also entails certiﬁ-
cation and evaluation of post-
graduate courses and accreditation

of the institutions which offer
them.
After graduation from the

University’s School of Medicine
in 1940, Dr. Ruhe interned at_
West Penn Hospital and return-
ed to the University the next
year as an instructor in physi-
ology and pharmacology. He has
since become associate professor
in this ﬁeld and in 1959 was ap-
pointed associate dean of the
School of Medicine.

“What I regret most about
leaving is that I have made so
many friends in my 20 years with
the University. I think I have en-
joyed most my association with
medical school students. This is
the thing I,will miss in working
with the AMA: I will no longer
be in an academic atmosphere,”
D‘;-...1.l.‘%13Fi.°_".“‘.’l‘C}‘..t€E‘l; _. - . N- —

Participant in Campus Affairs

The AMA is the professional
society which speaks for and re-
presents about ninety per cent of
practicing phys_icians.

Dr. Ruhe has participated in
many general University affairs
as a representative of the medi-
cal school. He took part in the
development of the Inter-pro-
fessional Seminar which is now
in its sixth year at the Univer-
sity.

Dr. Ruhe is currently chairman
of the medical school admissions
committee, has membership in the
American Physiological

Pittsburgh Society for Biological
Research.

He is also on the Board of Man-
agement of the YMCA, and on

the Board of Governors of the §

Past ‘Punch’ Editor
Pulls No Punches
In Noon Program

By PAT CHERKIN

Malcolm Muggeridge made
sport of world problems in his
Midday Series talk, diagnos-

‘. mg a “spreading disease of
 solemnity.”
‘ “No society can be free un-

it is constantly laughing."
editor of

less
declared the former
** “Punch.”

l\~lug‘geridge said, “humor is al-
most the only thing about which
the English are completely seri-
ous." But. he added, “the British
expect to hear something funny
in every political speech.”

Humor Admitted

The speaker intimated that so-
ciety should admit to the humor

' in world affairs. Muggeridge re-

‘ ferred to “Mr. Lumumba, that
r great parliamentaiian.”

He also suggested that those
students who have a taste for
music write a national anthem
for some small section of Africa
which has an “unpronouiiceablc
name.”

Muggeridge chided: “Take home
Sigmund Rhee and give him
homilies about the world of the
people, by the people, etc.”

Speeches Compared

Muggeridge compared the pres-
""“»-idential candidates’ speeches to
' ’/those of an after dinner speaker
who stands and “pours forth a
"stream of bromides and banali-
ties, with the guests so ‘drunk’
that the whole thing passes oﬂ.’
painlessly.”
iie'a_iso noted that there is
“no witticism in the recent TV
debates.” In our present gov-
ernmental situations, he said,
“the difficulty is that what is
happening is often inﬁnitely
more ridiculous than anything
you can imagine.”
Muggeridge recommended that
«vcandidates wear masks, and that
the people choose between the
two masks. He added, that “this is
not so remote as it might seem.”

Pitt won the big one. Breaking Syracuse’s 16 game winning streak
set well with ..the “ﬁghting” Panthers. You might say the Pitts were

up for this one. '

‘Not only did the Céts end up on the right side of the 10-0 score
but they literally pushed the Orange all over the ﬁeld.

First of all the main “burden” of the win must be borhe by
Coach John Michelosen. All season long Michelosen’s criticshave been
. having a ﬁeld day. But alas, they must be silent for a week.

Big “Mike” did a tremendous job in defensing the Orange-
men. Everywhere Syracuse turned there was a Jungle Cat wait-
ing. As a matter of fact Syracuse only penetrated Pitt‘ territory

01108.

Offensively Michelosen came up with an unbalanced line, and
a new double wing formation which completely caught Syracuse by

surprise_.

All week during practice Michelosen had the, Panthers working
on kickoffs and punt returns. Twice the Cats almost went “all the way

on- this same play.

“Michelosen is the best defensive coach in the count-ry,”‘stated

Scout Daryl Lewis.

The second explanation for ‘the. win will havegto go to Mr.
Lewis. For he handled the scouting of the Orangemen. And what
a job he did. “We knew ‘everything they were going to try,” com-

mented Chuck Reinhold, who had quite a day himself bringing
down All-American Back Ernie Davis.

“Give Lewis a lot of credit,” shouted Quarterback Ed Sharock-
man in the dressing room.

The third explanation must be an intangible one. There is no
love lost between the Pitt and Syracuse coaching staﬁs. The Panther
brains would. rather beat Syracuse than anybody else on the sched-
ule. This, weﬂare sure, they impressed upon the players during the
past week.

And to complete the win the Cats”'needed one more element.
Namely an over-all team effort. This they received. Pitt came up with
its best game of the year. Michelosen would not single out any one
Panther. He said it was a team effort. And certainly so.

But there are several players who must be mentioned: All-
American Mike Ditka, Ed Sharockman, Andy Kuzneski, Fred Cox,
Jim Cunningham,” Jim Traﬁcant, Chuck Reinhold, Ron Delﬁne
and Paul Hodge. ,

=l= * * I * - *

John Yaccino, who was about to break away for a TD on a punt
return when he was accidentally upset on a vicious block by Cat
Tackle Gary Kaltenbach had this to say about the freak play:

“I saw the clear ﬁeld in front of me and had visions of a touch-
down. All at once everything started spinning when I was hit."

“I ﬂew up in the air and hit the ground pretty hard. After the
play was over I kept wishing I would have landed on my feet and
cbntinued for the score‘.

Now that the end of the soccer season is just around the

corner, the Panther booters are beginning to look like the

team they were built up to be. Although the Blue and Gold

_ All of the scoring for Howard was, done in the ﬁrst half.
,The better conditioning of theO A ‘

Panthers allowed them to domin-,
ate the entire second half. The
Cats played a 300d d.€fenSiVe
game as two ‘of the Bisons’ goals
were supposedly lucky shots.

This was the ﬁrst game that the
Panthers were really able to move
the ball well,,but only once were
they able to get that all important
pay,-off punch. -

“This and the game against St.
Louis were the two best games

Coach Bemis. “We moved the ball
beautifully and we should have
had more goals. The game was
much closer than the score indi-
cated. We were constantly press-
ing the Bisons in the second half,
but we just don’t seem to have
that scoring Punch-”

“The Little Leprechaun,” Pete
Smith, scored the only goal of
the contest for the Panthers.
Smith maneuvered the ball
around in the penalty zone and
scored on a 20 yard blast. This
was the ﬁrst game that he was
able to play in top form. «

Crush Mighty Syracuse, 10-0

By JACK SIVIITH

Right now the Panthers
feel elated over their stunning
10-0 win Saturday, and why
not? As a team they saw the
job that was cut out for them;
then proceeded to beat Syra-
cuse as a smooth working unit.

“It was a team victory,” Coach
John Michelosen said./‘I don’t

want to single out any particular

player. Everybody played well.
Again I say, it was a team vic-
tory.” ,
“Syracuse Coach Ben-Schwartz-

outstanding iplay. “Pitt played

voted as top lineman of the game.
Players Meet Challenge

Many of the Panthers took ad-
vantage of the occasion to turn in
their best performances of the
year. The players felt that their
line play was noticeablystronger
than it had been in any previous
game.

All-East Guard Larry Vig-
nali, who interecepted a pass,
played ‘the game of an All-
American, players said. Regis
Coustillac nailed down the other
guard slot despite a sprained
ankle. They were supported by
Paul Hodge,,who hurt his knee

To Stay Unbeaten

Panther Cub gridders came up

at the practice ﬁeld. Although
scored upon for the ﬁrst time, the
Little Cats breezed to a 34-6 win.

_ The ﬁrst Panther touchdown
came as Pete Billey scampered 16

The State score came in the

Ed Sharockman 3rd
Cat Ground Gainer
With 3.7 Average

By JACK SMITH

No quarterback in the coun-
try displays more conﬁdence
as a runner than Ed Sharock-
man, number three ground
gainer on the Panther football
team. R

In 22 carries this year Sharock-
man has picked up 192 yards for
an average of 8.7 yards per carry.
‘His favorite play, the rollout,
sprung him loose on a 76-yard
scamper against TCU. v

“Actually the play was suppos-
ed to go to the fullback," Sha-
rockman said, “but when I saw
the lineman clogging up the cen-
ter I decided to run.” To run with
the ball is not a new convention
for Sharockman.

ED SHAROCKMAN, Panther quarterback, has regained his soph-
S C h 0 01 Sharockman distim omore form as a runner in the past two games. Against TCU he ran
76 yards but failed to score, and last Saturday he sparked the Cats

guished himself as a. running
quarterback. He made the All-
State football’ team and also
gained All-American recogni-
tion. He lettered three years in
football, basketball and base-
ball. He received eight profes-
sional baseball offers along with
offers from colleges all over the
nation.

Like many other Panther stand-
outs, Sharockman hadn’t been
contacted by Pitt until after grad-
uation. After seeing the campus,
and discovering the educational
opportunities, Sharockman decid-
ed to join the Panthers whom he
felt had one of the best football
teams in the nation.

As; a freshman there Weren’t
many plays that called for a run-
ning quarterback. So Sharockman
decided to make up some of his
own. “Fullback you run for the
hole and I’l1.fol1ow you,” Sha-
rockm-an said. His plays netted
him three touchdowns against
Kent State.

After gaining recognition ”as
a sophomore he dropped out of
school for a year. Starting out‘
slow this year Sharockman has
picked up momentum both run-
ning and passing.

“I was never considered to be
much of a passer,” Sharockman
said. “but I ‘do think that my
passing has improved.” His favo-
rite targets are Ends Mike Ditka
and Steve Jastrzembski.

His team mates and friends call
him “the buzzard.”

As a freshman, Sharockman
went to the barbers and asked
for a flat top. “The barber darn
near shaved me bald,” Sharock-
man said. “When I came back to
the dorm my roommate said my
head looked like a buzzard, I’ve
had the name ever since.

“The buzzard” also takes part
in intramural basketball and is
a member of the Panther Club
for letter winners.

There are few athletes- on the
Panther squad as genuinely funny
as Sharockman.

When asked what he calls his
mother and father he causually
replied, “Mom and Dad.”. “N0,”
the reporter said, “didn’t you ever
call them anything else. “Nothing
I could repeat,” Sharocknian
answered. It was learned however
his parents names are John and
Elizabeth. Sharockman. They re-
side in St. Clair, Pa.

Recently there has been some
talk about Sharockman being
shifted to halfback. “It’s not that
I would mind playing halfback,”
Sharockman said, “but I’m not a
good plocker and I feel it would
take me too long to learn the
position. However, I’ll' play
wherever I can help the team
best.” .

But "you can make a bet that no

;Sd_roy,an:’s. ‘The Time of Your Life’

Opening Night Performance

Proves Success for Mc-Hale

By CHUCK

DUNBAR

Opening night at Pitt Players production of William
Saroyan’s “The Time of Your Life” proved to be another
success for director Michael McHale. Starting slowly the
acting soon achieved a momentum,_worthy of Broadway.

Herb Margolis and Murray Susser were outstanding and

could have carried the play by

themselves. Margolis as Nick

the bartender was as much at¢
home on the stage as he would be
in the living room.

Susser, appearing as Joe the
philanthropist, was close to per-
feet, never over or under-playing
his role.

Drama Follows Theme

“Living is an art,” according to
William Saroyan, and accordingly
his drama follows this theme. The
scene is Nick’s Saloon in San
Francisco in the year 1939. Here
in this one little bar passes a con-
densation of life in the form of
drunkards, prostitutes, policemen,
slumers, and philosophers.

Actually every character is in
his own way a philosopher. Each
is caught in the undeﬁable net
called life. Saroyan feels that
life is basically good, and the
good life is what his characters
strive for, but never attain.

Tom and Kitty, very aptly por-
trayed by Steve Gordon and Bar-
bara Goodstein, are misguided pa-
trons of Nick’s bar. Kitty is a

Joe attempts to bring the two to-

gether so that they may know

happiness, and in the end does so.
Nothing Resolved

But really nothing has been re-
solved by the play. It leaves only
the impression that we indeed are
merely actors in “the human com-
edy.” At times he has made his
characters so dynamic that they
obscure the message oflthe play.

Highlighting the production
were the ﬁne portrayals by Ron
Caplan, Tony Lufrano, and
David Harding. Their charac-
terizations are an example of
excellent casting. Caplan ap-
peared as Dudley, a zealous
lover, Lufrano as Harry, a flop
of a comedian, and Harding as
Kit Carson, a phony Texan.

Paul Boas appearing as the pint-
sized newsboy was a show-stop-
per. But ﬁrst place in show-stop-
ping must go to Technical Director
Al Wagner for his light-ﬂashing
and ﬂag-waving pin ball machine
that is equaled only by Bill
Veeck’s exploding scoreboard in
,Chicago’s Comisky Park.

For a college production the
show was above par. For an even-
ing's entertainment it could have
been “the time of your life.”

national laboratory active in virtually all
phases of the atomic energy program.

ON NOVEMBER 7

Lawrence Radiation Laboratory staff members
will be on campus to answer your questions
about a career’ in nuclear research.

They will interview outstanding:

chemists electronic engineers
physicists mechanical engineers
metallurgists ceramic engineers
mathematicians chemical engineers

Call your placement ofﬁce for an appointment.

Tory HA is the first of a series of test reactors
being developed under the Lawrence Radiation
Laboratory’s nuclear Ramjet program.

A reactor for ramjet propulsion must operate
at high power levels yet be of minimum size
and mass. Its design must consider the very high
pressure drop across its length, the stress loads
due to ﬂight maneuvering, and the extremely

high radiation ﬂux level which itself leads to
severe heat transfer and radiation damage prob-
lems. Because the operating temperature exceeds
that at which most conventional structural ma-
terials fail, the core itself consists of bundled
tubes of sintered uranium and beryllium oxide
fabricated with central holes for continuous air
passage. ‘
