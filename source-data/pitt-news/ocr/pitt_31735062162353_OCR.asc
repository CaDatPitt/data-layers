Key Democrat Predicts , Tax Cut Debate Splits Capitgg
Aug. l Impeachment Vote    

WASHINGTON AP--House Ma-
jority Leader Thomas P. “Tip”
O’Neill,_D-Mass., said Wednesday
that a full House vote on the
impeachment of President Nixon
will take_ place‘ about Aug. 1.

“There is going to be a vote,”
O’Neill said. “There’s no question
about it.” I

O’Neill also said that portions of
the edited White House transcripts
which he has read have convinced
him that the President was guilty of
obstructing justice in his attempts
to thwart a 1972 investigation by
the House Banking Committee into
campaign irregularities. However,
O’Neill declined to say whether he
thought the President’s action

constituted‘ an impeachable of- ‘

fense.

O’Neill also told interviewers on
the CBS radio program “Capitol
Cloakroom” that the President was
in contempt of Congress and the
Constitution for failing to turn over
the actual tapes'of the conversa-
tions to the House Judiciary
Committee. '

In outlining the projected sche-
dule for the House proceedings,
O’Neill said a‘ vote would occur
regardless of whether the Judiciary
Committee votes for or against.
impeachment. _

O’Neill predicted it wouldtake

six weeks for the Judiciary
Committee to complete the public
hearings expected to begin next
week. After that, he said, it would
take the committee about two
weeks to draw up and vote on a bill
of impeachment.

If the committee votes in favor of
impeachment, O’Neill said, theibill
would be sent to the floor via the
House Rules Committee, asis the

House could still bring the bill up
for debate on the floor, he
explained.

In either case, O’Neill said, the
impeachment bill probably would
be sent_to the House ﬂoor either
immediately before or after the
July 4 holidays and that the debate
would begin in the “third or fourth
week in July.” There would be no
limit on debate.

_ O'Neill said he expected the
debate to last about two weeks, at
which time Judiciary Chairman
Peter Rodino, D-N.J. would offer a
motion to shut off any further

BY ANDREA ZIPF ‘

The controversy’ between‘ the
Nixon administration and some
Democraticxmembers of Congress
concerning tax cuts is not to be
taken as. a mere political dispute
according to Pitt economist Reubin
Slesinger. .

Slesinger said in an interview
that he argues the split over taxes
is more a difference in economic
philosophy than a split between
Democrats and the Administration.

A split exists, however, between
those who favor inﬂation over
unemployment and those who favor
unemployment over inﬂation.

“If you want to reduce inﬂation
you must suffer the consequences
of high unemployment,” Slesinger
said. “At the same time if you
attempt to reduce unemployment
you must, suffer with higher’
inflation.” '

According to reports in the New
York Times, Democratic leaders in
the Senate including Edward
Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey
called for a tax cut, “following
reports of the steepest rate of
inﬂation since‘l95 la and a decline in
the gross national product.”

In a prepared staternenttothe
Times Humphrey said :“a tax cut is
needed for low- and middle-‘income
families” who are suffering the
most from high taxes and inﬂation.

By CATHY TUTTLE

A drunk, with a fifth of bourbon
in her coffeethermos, had been
_waiting since 4 am at the
Government Printing Office in
Washington, D.C. to get a copy of
the Nixon transcripts.

“I want to see what the
_ (expletive deleted) is up to now,”

‘she confessed to me when I sat
" down, second in line at 5:30.
By 6 am, 2 hours before the GPO
bookstore opened, 20 people were
, seated on the long bench at the
i -entrance. The pile of day old New
York Times and Washington Posts
on a table were soon evenly
‘ distributed among the early risers.
“Would you look at that,” said a
well-dressed HEW lawyer in a
. checked London Fog raincoat said
to his friend, another lawyer.
“That nut (Nixon) is trying to win
4 back public support by going orra
speaking tour.
What kind of fools does he take us
for?"

A young sewage worker and his
little brother were laughing at what
turned out to be a press release
from the White House, which
urged the public to have open-
mindedness in reading the tran-
script and reminded Americans
that the President was in no way
‘ involved in the Watergate scandal.
1 “Thank-you," a little old lady
beamed to two bus drivers (who
were on strike), as they helped her
to an empty seat. She carefully

opaque plastic boots covering her
spiked heels and avidly began to
read The New York Times editorial
page.

By 7 am, it was light and the rain
outside had stopped, ushering in
another 100 or so people; a civics
class from Georgetown University
whose teacher had made them all
buy a copy of the $12.25 blue book,
an ice-cream vendor, and num-
erous minor government officials.

Nixon jokes were in the air.
Some rotten: “The only President
to have a worse Vice-President
than Nixon was Eisenhower.” And
some good: the ice-cream vendor
said his newest and hottest ﬂavor
was impeachmint. One of the
Georgetown students sang a
version of “Auld Lang Zyne,"
where the words. “for auld lange
zyne," were replaced with, “if only
he’d resign." Try it, it works.

By 7:55, close to 400 people were
impatiently milling about the
entrance. As the 1000 copies of the
transcripts printed that day and
rationed. one per customer were
wheeled into the bookstore a sigh
of almost desire rose from the
waiting crowd.

At last, at precisely 8, ten people
at a time were allowed to enter the
store. There. they were, stacks and
stacks of books, bound in stiff
construction paper._ “This is a
historic moment,” whispered the
tipsy woman in front of me as she
reached for the first book.

 

Next to the sky blue volumes
were lime green copies of The
Investigation of President Nixon’s
Tax Returns. “Oh! Marvelous!
What a find!" squealed the little
high school teacher behind me as
he scooped up 3 copies of the Tax
Return as well as his Watergate
book.

Because of the bus strike, a
woman who worked for the
Maritime Commission drove me
back to the bus terminal. “I don't
like Nixon. I don't like him at all,"
she told me at a stoplight. “Don’t
tell anyone," she said, lowering
her voice, “but I voted for him.”

Washington at 8:30 was alive
with activity. It had a feeling of a
city about to make a monumental
decision. It was the city that
housed a leader that nobody liked,
or trusted. Not the cabdrivers, not
the bus ticket sellers, not the
soldiers waiting to board a bus.

The only semi-favorable res-
ponse to my question of , “do you
trust the President?" was a fat
security guard, usheri_ng a drunk
out of the terminal. To that simple
question, he gave an enigmatic
reply I have been puzzling over
ever since. He said, “Let's just
say, he is the President."

Ban On ‘Secret Police’  

WASHINGTON AP--The Senate
Watergate committee staff has
urged creation of a permanent
special prosecutor and the passage
of strict laws to prevent any
President from creating a secret
police.

Prepared mainly by chief counsel
Samuel Dash, the 170-page draft
report details the committee’s
findings in its probe of the
Watergate break-in and cover-up
and makes several legislative

recommendations. These focus on‘

the creation of a permanent public
attorney who would act as an
ombudsman but would be able to
probe allegations of high-level
corruption and conflict of interest.

A copy of the draft report sent to

' all seven members of the Water-

gate -committee, was made avail-
able by a source close to the
committee.

“The potential for new abuses of
power and failure of law enforce-
ment are now known to be too
dangerous to our free society to not
take precautionary steps while the
wound of the Watergate scandal is
still fresh," the report said.

The draft also recommended that
Congress make it illegal for any

federal official in the President’s

executive office to engage in any
form of domestic or national
security intelligence gathering.

.Th_e recommendation was aimed
at preventing another White House
plumbers unit similar to that which
carried on investigations for
President Nixon.

“The mark of every totalitarian
state is a secret police responsible
only to authoritarian power," the
report said.

“The evidence the committee
received concerning the estab-
lishment in the White House, by
direction of the President, of a
special investigator's unit, known
as the ‘plumbers’ illustrates the

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Emergency phones enabling
people to summon University
Police for assistance within one
minute are now, operational at 44
locations around the Pitt campus.

According to Health, Safety and
Parking Director Joseph Gil, one of
the designers of the new systems,
merely taking the phone off the
hook alerts an officer at the

fsswitchboard, and it is not necessary
to speak to anyone at the other end
of the line.

Emergency phones located out-
side main buildings are equipped
with a mast and a glowing amber
light to help people locate them
easily.

There was a slight delay in the
activation of the system, according
to Gil, “The weather hurt us, but
we put them as fast as they can be
sunk.

Gil said that on-the-site inspec-
tion of the proposed locations
resulted. The system is designed
so distribution of the phones serves

-ri‘g,reas of high density usage, or as
Gil, said “pedestrian corridors. ’ ’

“In most places,” Gil said, ‘_‘you'
are going to be no more than a
minute from some sort of help.
When we started this thing, we
picked 24 locations, there were
changes made and a lot of that was
the result of student input.” '

The system is based on many

3 already in operation throughout the
country in college communities,
including a similar emergency
phone system designed by Gil for
Carlow College.

 ,  Campus Police Sergeant William

Cavazza said the system had the .

support of the entire University.
“Ideally, we would never have to
use it,” he commented, “We want

 

to by—pass normal channels of \
communication which may be
closed, providing instant access to
the police department.”

“If we got a call from Hillman
Library our response would be to
answer the call and also to seal off
the exits,” Cavazza added.

Gil said the system includes
options for expansion into the
Professional Quadrangle and any
other new building the University
may complete in the future.

Along with expansion, Pitt is
testing an alternative device which
uses no telephone receiver.

‘‘I’m confident,” Gil said, “that
the University will commit funds to
the system for several years.”.

The campus security phone
system is also part of a general
internal security and survelliance
network being implemented by the
Univeristy, according to Gil.

On lmpudence

The reaction of the Senate Committee on Athletics to discussion of
the future funding of the Pitt Hockey Club was a blatant disregard of
students’ rights andobligations to seek resolution to legitimate student
grievances within the appropriate University bodies.

The question of Hockey Club funding was on the agenda of the April
11 meeting and the discussion was led by Student Government Board
member Pat Kablach. The Board has cut its support of the Hockey

Club and is presently engaged in seeking funds from the University. ‘

e The reaction of the Athletic Department to the request made to the
committee was not a positive one. Athletic Director Casmir Myslinski,
said the Athletic Department was not capable of funding the Hockey
Club, but refused to supply a rationale for the decision. Kablach
termed this unacceptable and the Pitt News must agree.

After the meeting Dr. Harry J. Werner, chairman of the committee
called Kablach an “impudent student” and implied the members
of the committee were not open to any other argument except that
promoted by Myslinski.

As an elected representative Kablach was speaking on behalf of all
students at Pitt. Students have a right to expect the faculty and
administration to approach mutual subjects of concern with open
minds. A dialogue must exist among the three groups for the
University to ﬁuiction effectively for the students.

Students should expect reasonable explanations for administrative
decisions. When they are not forthcoming elected student
representatives have no alternative but to question the legitinncy of
the decision. -

 Students are not token representatives of university committees.

They deserve the same treatment as their faculty and administrative
counterparts. Otherwise, student participation is meaningless. A
Calling elected representatives “impudent” and failing to maintain
open minds on important campus-wide issues which are the subject of
discussion, is not conducive to maintaining the open channel of
comrruinication among students, faculty, and administrators that
allowed Pitt to escape the tragic and turbulent campus uprisings of the

liattling the House...

President Nixon’s adamant refusal to supply the House Judiciary
Committee with additional tape recordings threatens to further delay
impeachment proceedings in Congress, and more importantly,
indicates the President is willing to provoke a constitutional crisis over
the perilous question of impeachment. ‘

James St. Clair, the President’s coimsel, announced Tuesday that .

Nixon had decided not to honor any further requests for tapes by the
House Judiciary Committee. St. Clair said the President thought the
committee had all the information it needed to conduct and complete
its investigation. /

The House Judiciary Committee which is entrusted with the

 responsibility of impeachment as provided for by the Constitution is

being challenged by the President. If more tapes are subpoenaed by
the Committee it is clear the President does not plan to comply. The
Committee, unable to enforce its subpoena, could judge the President

=’ to be in contempt of Congress setting off a most serious constitutional

confrontation between the executive and the legislative branches.

Ihenationhas-nootherrecotuseIruttodermndﬂ1attheJudiciary
Cormnittee determine and obtain all the evidence it deems necessary
for the immediate resolution of the impeachment issue.

The American people must be certain of the President’s irmocence or
guilt, both criminally and ethically, in the numerous scandals which
have rocked his administration. Only then can conﬁdence be restored
in a government that has wallowed in Watergate too long largely
because of the President’s attempts to delay and impede the
impeachmant process.

...And Leon Jaworski

Not only is the President provoking yet another constitutional crisis,
but he is also risking the prosecution of seven of his aides indicted in
the Watergate scandal by rejecting Special Prosecutor Leon J aworski’s

attempt to seek a compromise solution to his request for additional _

tapes of White House conversations.
Through St. (lair, President Nixon announced he would not release
any more tapes to Jaworski because the President contends the full
. story on Watergate is out as the result of his release of the transcripts.

« To avoid a confrontation with the President, Jaworski proposed a

compromise which was rejected by the White House.

By agreeing to appoint another special prosecutor after the ﬁring of
Archibald Cox, the President admitted the need for a special
investigating force independent of the Justice Department. Nixon
pledged his cooperation to Jaworski at that time, as he had to Cox
before him, but has reneged on that committment.

According to J aworski, the tapes are essential for the prosecution of
the Watergate defendants. The Special Prosecutor has pledged to seek

‘ cometoanend,perhaps

the tapes in the courts, a procedure which forced the dismissal of his
predecessor last fall. As with the House Judiciary Committee, the
President is challenging the authority of the Special Prosecutor’s
ofﬁce.

Jaworski, in doing justice to his case, is obligated to return the
President’s challenge and we urge him to do so. The Watergate
defendants must not be excused without the beneﬁt of a fair and

judicious trial. Fin-thermore, if the charges in the Watergate case are

dropped because of a lack of evidence, it would do severe injustice to
the defendants themselves, the American judicial system, and
Americans’ sense of their own political system. ,

Scott’s Comment

Senator Hugh Scott’s denunciation of the‘ contents of the Watergate
transcripts is a crucial change of position by the Minority leader of the
Senate which indicates he may have been mislead by the White House,
when defending the Nixon administration.

After reading two-thirds of the transcripts, the senior Senator from
Pennsylvania characterized them by saying they portrayed
“deplorable, disgusting, shabby, immoral performances” by those
who participated in the discussions, including President Nixon.

In expressing his moral indignation against the White House, the
Senator said his supportive role tor ‘the Republican President would
since he did not wish to assume a position in
sympathy with the “immorality or criminality” the transcripts

This is both a sudden and remarkable change of position by a nun
the President would nomially depend on to garner the votes needed to
escape a guilty verdict on impeachment in the Senate.

Senator Scott has deplored the Watergate incident in the past, but
had expressed his conﬁdence in Nixon’s innocence. In January Scott
went so far as to say that the White House had evidence that would
prove John W. Dean 3rd to be a liar. He maintained the evidence
would “exculpate” the President. He also implied that the American
people would realize the President’s innocence if the material were
released.

Eight days after the release of the transcripts of White House
conversations, which would presumably include the evidence on which
Scott had based his original defense of the President, through his press
secretary, he no longer asserts that the transcripts “exculpate”
anybody. Evidently, even Scott is questioning the innocence of the
man he has so vehemently defended in the past.

Senator’ Scott’s sudden reversal indicates he no longer ~-has
conﬁdence in the President. It also infers that the Senator was not told
the complete truth about the Watergate scandal by the White House.
The idiocy of the Senator’s expressions of support for an embattled
President have returned to haunt him. ‘

More than anything Scott’s reactions to the transcripts reveal the
White House was content with ' ' to the Senator only that
information which would nmke it possible for the Minority Leader to
defend the president-information that did not involve either criminality

, or immorality to which the Senator now refers. Apparently, President

Nixonwaswillingtouse Scottasanunwittingbuffoonﬁghtingthe
battles of a’ defenseless administration. "
Tragically, however, Scott was more than willing to play the role.

Fuclging
The

Principle

The Federal Government no
longer provides the tools necessary‘

to support “life, liberty and the‘:8;"

pursuit of happiness" for those
who cannot adequately function in
our technological society.

The poor, the ignorant, the
young and the old struggle to
sustain life. They have no time to
exercise their freedoms or to
pursue happiness. They are
concerned only with surviving in
modern society. /

The attentions of the Federal
Government have been focused on
ﬁscal and foriegn policy, neglecting
the concern for human services
which characterized the 60’s.

.Presidential tapes and transcripts

are overshadowing the developﬁ

ment of such programs as National
Health Insurance, Model Cities and
Comprehensive Day Care Centers.

Legislation to alleviate the high
cost of health care, to provide
monies for day care centers for the
lower working class families, to
help correct the overcrowded
conditions in the cities has fallen by
the wayside. In fact, such
legislation fails to be reported out
of committee.

Society has neglected its primary
goal. This nation no longer

provides minimum care for the -"9-

needy. Those who do not possess
the capacity to take care of their
daily needs are being ignored by
the federal government.

The greatest asset of this nation
has always been its care for the.
people. Providing human services
is a fixed responsibility of
government founded on the pre-
mise “of the people, by the
people” and ’ most importantly

' “for the people.” Apparently this

is inoperative. The actions of the
Federal Government indicate a
disregard for the welfare of the
American people.

The emphasis has
become one of revenue sharing and
cash grants directly-to the poor so
they may purchase services they

deem necessary. Programs such as '

OEO, Manpower, Community Ac-
tion and others are in danger of not
being funded after this ﬁscal year.

The responsibility for these
programs will shift to state and
local governments. However, the
state and local governments do not
possess the resources needed tb
develop expertise in the area of
human services. The Federal

Government does possess these "

resources. Local ' governments

’ should not be forced to pick up

human services it can not maintain
at current levels.

It is imperative that federal
funding be available for human
service programs which benefitthe
people. Then, these services will
be able to meet the needs of the
people they are intended to help.
. The United States is on the verge
of it’s‘ 200th aniversary as a nation.

from a fledgling confederation of 13

‘colonies to a highly developed

It is indeed unfortunate that on
the eve of this anniversary, the

In a recommendation aimed at

“The committee finds that the
weight of the evidence tends to
establish that Mitchell did approve
the Liddy intelligence plan with a
q_uarter million dollar budget in
Key Biscayne on March 30, 1972,"
the draft report said. Mitchell has

‘ Convicted Watergate conspirator
G. Gordon Liddy is alleged to have
used large sums of money provided
by the Committee for the Re-elec-
tion of the President to finance the

quarters in the Watergate hotel
and office complex.

The draft report also said the
staff has found no evidence to
support President Nixon’s claim, as
reported in his statement of May
22, 1973, that he withdrew his
approval of a widespread and
covert intelligence gathering plan
authored by White House aide. Tom
Charles Huston.

But the staff report’ said that the
Huston plan, which called for
creation of an interagency domestic

commit break-ins, open private

was never, according to committee

announced a plan in which Senator
John Stennis would review the
tapes and when Cox expressed dis-
satisfaction, he was fired.

Now the same stage has been set
again. St. Clair announced that the
President -will not release further
Watergate tapes and Jaworski
announced yesterday his decision
to “continue the court ﬁght.” If
the two courts once again rule in
favor of the special prosecutor, the
President will again have to decide
whether or not to risk a Supreme
Court case which, if lost, would add
another load to his burden perhaps
in the midst of televised impeach-
ment hearings in the House
Judiciary Committee.

As for the consequences of
Nixon’s refusal to give additional
evidence to the prosecutor’s office,
it could jeopordize the cases of
several Watergate defendents, and
in the process, in the words of Pitt
Constitutional Law Professor
Richard Seeburger, constitute an-
other impeachment article against
the President. A

“Insofar as the (Jaworski)
subpoena runs against the Presi-
dent,” Seeburger said citing the
doctrine of executive privileg,” I
think he is immune. It is a fact that
the President cannot _be compelled
to respond to it - that much is
clear."

However, referring to a possible
Nixon refusal to yield to Jaworski’s
subpoena and give up the evidence
needed in the prosecution of

 

 

 
 

. /1

alleged Watergate conspirators,
Seeburger said the President
“would be interfering with the
enforcement of the law. That in
itself would be an impeachable
offense.’,’

   

The law professor who studied
under former Prosecutor Cox at
‘Harvard Law School said that the
Executive does have a claim of
privilege from" some processes of
government, but the issue involved
is whether or not in this case there
is an abuse of that power. “It
seems to me that in studying
impeachment Congress could say
this is an abuse of power,”
Seeburger said.

But the crucial matter ahead, as
Seeburger pointed also out, rests in
the White House confrontation
with the House Judiciary Com-
mittee, and whether it “will stop on
the floor of the House of
Representatives” in a vote for or
against impeaching the President

Confrontation 

as Counsel St. Clair indicated

Tuesday.

9 Unlike a prosecutor’s subpoena,
Seeburger said, the President is
nor immune from a Judiciary
Committee request. “The power
under the constitution was made
into the three branches, but it is
ultimately in’ the impeachment
process. That’s the last step.”

‘‘It seems to me that the
Constitution gave the House the
power of conducting the investi-

gation. ,And it goes back to what

(Vice-President) Ford said about ‘

impeachment--that it is whatever
the Congress says it is. Then once
the committee goes ahead to seek
information-—that’s it.”

~ Technically if the President does
not respond to the House unit’s_
subpoena, the Committee has the
authority to hold him in contempt
of Congress. More likely, however,
the Judiciary committee will draw
the President’s refusal into another
article of impeachment.

Crime in Oakland Community Examined ,1

BY RALPH HAURWIT Z

The number of major crimes in
Oakland dropped from 1947 in 1972
to 1399 in 1973, a decrease of
28.1%, according to statistics
compiled by the Pittsburgh Bureau
of Police in their “Annual Report of
Major Crimes By Census Tract.”

The most dramatic decrease was
in burglaries, down 36.4%, from
593 to 377. Also down were
robbery, 26.9%; larceny, 29.3%;
and assaults, 7.3%.

. Rape increased 46%, from 17 in
1972 to 25 in 1973, while the
number of murders and man-
slaughters remained the same at
four. .

These statistics are for crimes
reported to the Pittsburgh Police.
The University of Pittsburgh
Campus Police also keeps records
and statistics.

Their statistical report which
includes theft, robbery, burglary,
narcotics, sex crimes, and assaults,
shows 1165 crimes for 1971, and
1089 for 1972. The ﬁgures for 1973
are not yet fully compiled.

Some overlap exists between the

city statisticsand the campus
statistics, according to Captain,
Edward Patterson of the Pittsburgh
Police Records Section.

“Some of the Campus Police
crimes might be processed through
us (the City Police), and some
might not be,” Patterson said.

He added it would be “very
difficult” to get an accurate picture
of crime in Oakland by adding
together the city and campus
statistics.

Some law enforcement officials
doubt the_value and accuracy of
statistics in reflecting crime. Some
crimes--many rapes, for example--
are never even reported, and
administrative procedures for re-
cording crimes can change, further
confusing the statistical evidence.

Campus Police Officer Kolesky

‘‘I don’t believe in statistics,”
said Inspector William Moore of
Station No. 4, which covers
Oakland and Hazelwood. “It's all
relative. You can do anything with
statistics.”

Campus Police Officer Arnold
Tarr said, “Crime goes up every
year.” His colleague Bob Kolesky
claimed “serious crimes have
increased in the past 10 years, but
they haven’t increased proportion-
ately with the student buildup.”

However, a statistical evaluation
of the Campus Police Department
from 1971 through October 1973
claims an accurate comparison
between present and past campus
crime statistics would be'impos-
sible and states in its report: “A
statistical study previous to Janu-
ary 1971 would be misleading
because of the drastic change in
Department structure and philoso-
phy which occurred previous to this
period.”

overall crime picture is considered
small by Inspector Moore who has
been at the Oakland station four

"months, and was previously In-

spector at East Liberty for 2‘/2
years.

“Oakland is not a high crime
area," he said, “like the Hill
District or East Liberty. In terms of
other areas, it compares very
favorably.

“In East Liberty, a day’s crime
reports stack three or four inches
high, but_in Oakland I only get
about ‘/4 inch of reports per day."

As an explanation for Oakland's
relatively low crime rate, Moore
suggested its stability as a
community, its concerned com-
munity groups, and the involve-
ment of Pitt, Carlow College, and
the hospitals.

Moore said however, that the
presence of Pitt in Oakland has a

great deal to do with its« crime,
since the University brings many
thousands of people into the
Oakland community every day.

The resident population of
Oakland is only 24,152, according
to the Bureau of Police Census
Tract. Acting Chief of Campus
Police Kurt Graham estimated the
University draws some 31,000
students and 6000 employees and
argued a certain amount of crime is
to be expected.

“This is an urban center with'a
high concentration of females. Our
incidents of theft, rape, and other
crimes are bound to be quite
different from rural schools,” said
Graham.

_Off1cer Tarr considers crime a
social problem, and feels citizens
must take a more active role in
crime prevention before the situa-
tion will ease..

“Law enforcement is only as

good as the citizens. People have -

to understand the usefulness of law
enforcement, know ‘its shortcom-
ings, and demand that police be
good and honest,” said Tarr.

“The'University is a big market
for crime--this is where it’s at.”

Tarr chided people in the
University for their ignorance in
crime prevention and cited numer-
ous examples of thefts resulting
when naive students leave doors
unlocked.

“The Towers is a stupid place,”
he said. “Most kids don’t know
that you shouldn’t even go to the
bathroom without locking your
doorf’

In 1972, 788 thefts and 163
burglaries were reported at Pitt.
To combat this, Tarr advised
students and staff to report
seemingly unusual or abnormal
activity to the campus police. He
cited one incident when six to eight
males walked through the Towers
trying doors and were able to steal
at leisure, since no one had
bothered to report their presence.

Street crimes--particularly rapes
--are on the increase in Oakland,
according to Moore. “This is
partly because of the transient kind
of community Oakland has become.
It’s not so much students who are
doing it, but visitors--people who
come in for a couple hours.”

Moore called rape a “big
problem,” estimating that eight
have occurred in the last month,
two of which took place within two
blocks of the police station, which
is located at Semple and Louisa.
He feels one man is responsible for
most of the attacks.

Most street crimes are commit-
ted at night, when attackers can
hide easily and fewer people are on
the street. Moore advised women
to avoid going out after dark.

‘‘If you do go out,” Moore said,
“Go in groups, or travel by car or
cab. Carry a preventive weapon--
but the best weapon is a nice loud
scream. You run the risk of

panicking the attacker, though, in

which case he might become very
vicious."

Moore believes much thievery--
purse-snatching and auto theft--is
perpetrated by persons 18 and
under.

“There is 5' steady rise in auto
theft," said Moore. “Youngsters
are attracted to the cars and steal
them for a joy ride. Then they strip
them for parts.

“I don’t think we have organized
rings, though: Most are recovered
in 24 hours--98% are recovered."

Acting Chief of Campus Police Kurt Graham

Moore expects a rise in
robberies, assaults, vandalism, and
bike thefts during the summer.
“With school out and the warm
weather here, there will be alot
more kids on the street,” he said.

Acting Campus Police Chief
Graham does not expect a marked
rise in summer-time crime, rather a
shifting to bike thefts. Bikes are
stolenethree or four at a time by
organized rings, he said.

Graham estimates that juveniles
account for one-fourth of all arrests
by the campus police, mainly for
theft, vandalism, and trespassing
in restricted areas.

Another 25% of those arrested
are University people, both stu-
dents and staff. “We’re the
largest employer in the city of

Pittsburgh, and with over 6000

employees, we’re bound to have an
employee problem,” said Graham.
“But it’s hard to estimate the
amount of stealing that goes on.”
Tarr feels thefts of articles like
dictaphones, typewriters, univer-
sity supplies, and surgical instru-
ments are often not by outsiders,

but by University people--workers,

graduate students--with access to
such equipment. .

“Things are replaced too eas-
ily,” said Tarr. “Each department
should be responsible for their
equipment, and supervise their
security."

The job of the Campus Police is
“to deal with general investiga-
tions of all crime that occurs on
campus,” according to Graham,
whose three-month-old post as
acting Chief is to “stabilize the
department during the present
study of their operations.”

Training and legal aspects,
including the exact jurisdiction of
the Campus Police, are being
examined.

“In the past," Graham said,
“we had jurisdiction over all
university property and property
adjacent to it. But what is adjacent
property? That's now in the courts
being decided."

The Campus Police force is the
second largest_police agency in
Allegheny County, consisting of 61
males and four females. A

weekday shift numbers 15 to 18;!)-

-weekend shifts increase up to 21 or
25, according to Graham. Three
vans patrol on each shift.

“The four women on the force do
the same work as men,” said
Graham. “Two walk beats, one
patrols inside a building, and
there’s one female sergeant.”

Three detectives work. on thefts,
burglaries, and robberies, but for
some specialized investigations,

‘ the city police, is called in.

The elaborate communications M.
equipment of the campus police is '

undergoing expansion. The
University has installed 44 police
call-boxes within University build-

ings and installed .17 more
throughout the campus. The
system is in effect for the

beginning of spring season.

“These phones are for emergen-
cy use only,” stated Graham. “All
you have to do is pick up the
receiver, and our panel lights and
an alarm rings. We’ll know exactly
where you are. ‘

“Making a false police report is
an indictable offense, ‘so phony
calls won't go on long,” cautioned

Seven .

Poco (Epic Records)

This is Poco’s first album since
the departure of Richie Furay,
former focal point of the group and
writer of their best-known material.

The remaining four have success-'

fully compensated for his loss and
‘have produced an album that
retains the distinctive Poco sound
and even manages to cover some
new ground. 1

Steel guitar and smooth, precise
harmonies still abound, but the
overall sound has become some-
what heavier, ’ particularly on
“Skatin”’ and “Just Call My
Name.” In all, a good album by

one of America’s ﬁnest and least
recognized bands.

Melanie
cords)
Melanie’s new album is her best
since Lay Down (1970). The songs
she has written for it are lyrically
more mature than most’ past efforts
and at times recall the bittersweet
quality of Joni Mitchell’s work.
The arrangements support the
material without drowning it;
practically everything ‘on the record
sounds like it should be there.
There are ﬂaws, however, and
Melanie’s greatest one remains her

(Neighborhood Re-

   

tendency to over-use her distinctive
vocal mannerisms. JaggelRich-
ard’s “Wild Horses” starts out
well, but the haunting mood
initially created is spoiled by
massive over-orchestration and a
histrionic vocal at the end.
Madrugada is a pleasant album
which will surely delight those who
have loved Melanie in the past, and
perhaps surprise a few who had
written her off as insignificant.

  
 

Son of Dracula (soundtrack)
Harry Nilsson and friends (RCA
Records)

If you’re a compulsive follower of

the ex-Beatles, Nilsson and the

various musicians and hangers-on
who surround them, you’ll probab-
ly want this ‘album. It has a lot of
Nilsson songs (not all his best, and
only one new one) and campy
dialogue excerpts from the forth-
coming Starr/Nilsson movie.

Best of‘ all, a charming iron-on
Dracula for your favorite t-shirt is
included at no extra chargel,

   

Whirlwind

Deodato (MCA Records)

Eumir Deodato is the man who
unmercifully mutilated the opening
them from Strauss’s Also Sprach
Zarathustra and received a gold

    

 

    

record for his fiendish efforts. This
album contains another atempt to
bring classical music up to date, as
well as a lot of iazzy sounding stuff
that wouldn’t make bad Muzak.

If he keeps at it, Deodato could
be the Lawrence Welk of the
seventies.

tion for this band.
they’re bad; they’re simply undis-

strong hints of John Mayall and J.

BY HARRIS LEVY

Thought you were done with lists
for the summer, didn’t you? »
Thought you were through with
books too, eh? Well, you’re wrong
because you are now about to read
about the National Book Awards for
1974. The '74 award,-winners are,
as expected, interesting and
worthy books.

As was the case last year with
Chimera and Augustus, the fiction
award was shared by two books.
Pynchon’s
Gravity’s Rainbow, an ambitious
difficult novel which is the best-new
book that I have read in several
years. Pynchon, author of V. and
The Crying of Lot 49, has achieved
the recognition that he deserves.

The other fiction winner is A
Crown of Feathers by Isaac
Bashevis Singer. Singer’s latest
book is a collection of 24 stories.
These two are but a few of the
many fine fiction books published’
in 1973.

The winner in the Arts and
Letters category is Pauline Kael’s
Deeper Into Movies. The fourth
collection of reviews by one of
America's finest reviewers, the
book includes Kael’s reviews from
September 1969 to March 1972.
Malcolm Lowry by Douglas Day
was the winner for biographies.

The Poetry award was shared by
Allen Ginsberg and Adrienne Rich.
Rich’s Divinglnto the Wreck:
Poems 1971-1972 is her seventh
book of poems and concerns the
quest for truths about the powerful
and the powerless and about
women and men. Ginsberg’s latest

For the session starting July. 1914,
Euromed will assist qualilied Amer-
ican students in gaining admission ..
to recognized overseas medical
schools.

And that's just the beginning.

Since the language barrier constitiites
the preponderate difficulty in succeed-
ing at a foreign school, the Euromed
program also includes an intensive
12-16 week medical and conversa-
I tional language course, mandatory for

 
   
     
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
  
  
  
 

all students. Five hours daily, 5 days
per week (12-16 weeks) the course is
given in the country where the student
will attend medical school. '

In addition, Euromed provides stu-
dents with a 12-16 week intensive cul-
tural orientation program, with Amer-
ican students now studying medicine
in that particular country serving as
counselors.

Senior or graduate students currently
enrolled in an American university are -
eligible to participate in the Euromed
program.

Summertime for ﬁlms is tradi-

One of the better recent films is
The Supercops. [Groan not another

but one that really, should have
been done a couple years ago
before because the phrase» “cop

nauseous.

IT'S TIME TO REFORM
CAMPAIGN FINANCING

John W. Gardner, Chairman
Common Cause

Former Secretary
of Health, Education and Welfare

‘‘wouldn’t it be great if you didn't have to take a single
dime from anybody?" said Senator Philip Hart of Michi-
gan. He had in mind the uncomfortable, som’etimes de-
grading, experiences that political candidates have when
they go hat-in-hand to potential donors for contributions.

The costs of political campaigns have gone sky-high.
And monied special interests are always glad to meet

those costs in behalf of the candidate. The inevitable ,

result has been corruption., scandal and public mistrust
of the political process.

Today in most districts and states, candidates can't
run for public office unless they are rich, or unless they
are willing to put themselves under obligation to sources
of funds. That isn't the kind of country we started out
to be. ' '

There are honest contributors .who' give out of con-
viction, and there are honest politicians who don't repay
gifts with political favors. But let's face it: most large
political gifts are made with the intent to buy influence,
buy votes, buy politicians. ‘

The first principle of free self-government is account-
ability of government to the citizen. Elections are the
chief means through which‘citizens enforce that account-
ability. But if the winning candidate feels ’that his first
obligation is to his big campaign donors, public account-
ability is destroyed.

Here are some of the necessary ingredients of reform.

1) There must be low ceilings on individual or com-
mittee gifts.
2) There must be limits on spending—a|though

these must not be set too low or they will handicap‘

challengers.

3) There must be full public disclosure of all gifts
and expenditures. One of the most powerful forces for
clean government ever discovered is the light of day.

4) There must be an independent enforcement com-
mission with subpoena powers and the power to go to
court. It is shocking but truetthat no federal campaign
financing law has ever been seriously enforced by the
Justice Department.

Many are now beginning to see that there is one further
necessary ingredient if we are to have a responsible and
competitive political system —— namely, an element of
public financing in campaigns. '

Money for campaigns need not come totally and ex-
clusively from public funds. The bill recently debated in
the Senate permits a role for money from private sources,
although it places a ceiling on the size of gifts. It encour-
ages small private ‘contributions by providing th'at they
will be matched up to $100 each with public funds at the
primary level.

No candidate in the primaries will receive any federal
matched funds unless he or she has demonstrated the
ability to raise small private gifts up to a specific thresh-
hold amount. This will screen out frivolous candidates or

. candidates with no constituency.

There are legitimate questions as to the mechanics of
public financing, but these questions can be dealt with.
The real question is whether we intend to put behind us
once and for all a system of campaign financing in which
money can buy political outcomes.

There is much more to do. And the time to do it is now.
The American people are tired of being bilked and manip-
ulated. lt‘s time to give this country back to its people.

versy (their non-conformism dis-
pleased the brass and caused some
to suspect corruption) led to the
book The Supercops, which in turn
led to the flick. , '

By the way, the real Greenberg
and Hantz have small roles as two
hard-ass detectives in the heroes’
home precinct.

There‘are a lot of comparisons
with Serpico, a book/movie about

another controversial, non-con-. "

formist cop. Serpico is mainly a
serious character study of the guy
so troubled by police corruption
that he became the main impetus of
the idealized Knapp Commission.
Supercops, on the other hand, is an
exciting, comic_book tale of two
policemen caught up in the turmoil
after the Knapp Commission
showed itself to be a collection of
witch-hunters.

At first glance Supercops seems
like a good “kid-ﬂick.” The
acrobatics and flamboyance of

'Greenberg and Hantz (played by

Ron Leibman and David Selby,
respectively) fill, the screen ‘with
enough action to satisfy kids and
adults. There’s hardly enough sex
to make a preacher blush and
(more importantly) no gratuitous
violence. The only time anybody
gets killed the heroes are so upset
that the scene affects its nice
simple moral with some strength.

Okay, so why the -R-rating,
meaning that the perfect audience
for the movie isn't old enough to
get in? Probably because of the
“rough” language, which ﬁts
perfectly’ in with the story and
makes for some good laughs. But

why not let the kid go and see a film
about two cool cops called Batman
and Robin, even it the language is
almost as strong as what they hear
at home?

the New York policemen known as Batman and Robin, as two

I The kind of movie parents will
drag their young innocents to see is
Where The Lilies Bloom, a tale of

the bravery and fortitude of as

14-year-old girl striving to keep her
family together in the hills after her
father dies. Yawn.

' Lilies suffers from overly quaint

falling on the ears, sounding
humorous or stultiﬁed at all the
wrong times. Or maybe it’s just
Northern prejudice against South-
ern accents that makes an audience

girl successfully straining herself to
the limit. I

Probably the biggest disap-
pointment on film is The Conver-
sation, billed erroneously as “a
great mystery.” ,The mystery is
trying to figure out the plot after
the movie ends. _ A .

It starts out well enough with
Gene Hackman as a guilt-obsessed
surveillance expert. _ He has
successfully bugged a private,
seemingly innocent conversation

that is repeated throughout the
film. Hackman’sv work had
previously caused the murders of
three persons (as blasted in the
ads), and his anxiety rises over -the
well-being of his buggees.

The suspense is well drawn--to a
point--and Hackman is superb as
the obsessed man seeking to
prevent a crime he suspects will
happen. But the climax is so
muddled that it is quite difficult to
ﬁgure out exactly who did what to
whom, who was involved, and what
was the real purpose of the initial
conversation. The ending is a nice
touch of irony, even though unfair
to the character, but not too well
appreciated after expecting a
mystery. , '

Conrack is another idealistic-
teacher movie thatpati first seems
like To Sir With Love all over again,
this time with a white teacher and
black disadvantaged students. But
Conrack is not quite as saccharine--
its main character is more ﬁnely
detailed, with a large portion of
rambunctious young idealism and

60s-type rebellion against ‘authority .
‘borne out rather well by Jon'Voight

as Pal Conroy.

Conroy is the new teacher for
fifth to eighth graders on a small
South Carolina island that seems
lightyears away from the modern
town just up the river. His

"students can’t read the alphabet,

count from one to five or even
pronounce his name correctly (thus
Conrack for Conroy), and‘ are
physically as well as mentally
abused by the dispassionate school
system. Naturally Conroy succeeds

. in reaching his students with some

highly -, irregular methods, and is
rewarded with the inevitable boot
to those who try to work outside the

. system.

i Director Martin Ritt wisely kept
all the. kids (and Voight) from being

too cute, a rampant problem with A

films of this type. The story is kept
lively with sharp dialogue and
rhythmic, fast-paced editing.
Voight’s Conroy is quite easy to
warm up to, and his off-beat
character takes the would-be
stickiness out of this highly
idealistic ﬂick.

’ black outlaw.

Turning from do-gooders to the
“baddies” of life is Thomasine and
Bushrod, yet another episode in the
“they’re young, they’re in love,
they rob banks” saga popularized
by Bonnie and Clyde. Actually,
this ﬂick is a combination of B&C
and another great bank-robbing
duo, Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid, with an overall

‘black Robin Hood ﬂavor.

action from Butch Cassidy, and

does not rely on the gore that ran
through Bonnie. The characters
are more human than Bonnie's,
with the same sort of antiheroic
jocularity that carried Butch
Cassidy. In fact, if Thomasine had
the “names” of Butch Cassidy
connected .to it, it might have been
the same kind of cultist hit.

Obsessed by guilt and paranoia, Gene Hackman stars as the

surveillance expert whose outstanding “bugging” techniques have
already caused the murder of three persons, and he fears, will cause
the deaths of even more in The Conversation. V '

The story centers on ‘Thomasine
(Vonetta McGee), headstrong black
woman who survives ﬁrst by
bountyhunting, and Bushrod (Max
Julien, who also wrote and
co-produced the ﬂick) a_ gentle
They team up,

playing on the white prejudice that
\doesn’t think blacks "are “bold”
enough to rob banks, and distribute
most of the loot to poor people.
The action takes place between the
eras of Butch Cassidy "and Bonnie,‘
in 1911 Texas when the posse is
_ just as likely to pursue its quarry in
a truck ‘as on horseback.
The film’s style takes interplay-
ing dialogue and catchy music

However, the plot is a bit lighter,
and Bushrod’s occasional philoso-
phizing only weighs 'it down.
Director Gordon Parks Jr. has
softened his abrupt style, but he
still inserted his Superﬂy image
with a larger than life Jamaican
Jomo , ‘(Glynn Turman). But
Thomasine and Bushrod is a fairly
interesting flick,_ with some people
you may be able to dig.

A But for a really strange collection
of characters in an almost equally
weird plot, there’s Arnold. \_ This
ﬂick has a very effective, intriguing
ad campaign to lure the public to
the theatres. But the promotion
has one slight drawback: it gives

(away almost the entire plot, a

definite drawback for this genre.
— Arnold is the ultimate of the

spooky, haunted house murder
movies. All the favorite elements
are there: the monstrous Gothic

mansion in the English country-
side, the ubiquitous ground fog in
an ancient graveyard, a dead
millionaire eccentric with greedy
heirs, and a profusion of corpses

-meeting their ends through various

ghastly means.
There is very little to be taken
“seriously" in this" half-minded

title of one of the ﬁnest plays

stands as proof that the Well Made

The story involves a divorcee and
her two daughters, trapped in their

there is the feeling they will remain
there--not strong enough to choose

Mutants Survive In ‘Morigolcls'

marigold seeds that have been
bombarded with gamma rays.
They are not expected to grow, but
they do, in mutated forms.
Beatrice and her daughters have
also been bombarded with misfor-
tunes--poverty, divorce, break-
downs and the constant threat of
madness. Somehow they too
survive, in a mutated form.

The play, itself is a strange
hybrid. There are moments which
tower with all the stature of a Greek’
tragedy, translated into a more"
contemporary idiom. Mixed with
this is a bizarre black humor,

creating a precarious balance of
elements. The production main-
tains this balance successfully.

Doris Hackney chainsmokes her
way through the role of Beatrice
with a frightened desperation and a
boozy charm that gives depth and
substance to the character. is
Epstein and Amper, as the
daughters, have mastered the
pathology of their characters.
Stephanie Fitzgerald gives an
amazing performance as Nanny,
the invalid. Her movements are
agonized and laborious, coming
across as totally realistic. Although
she does not have a speaking part,
her mere presence dominates the
stage picture.

Director Norman Rene has
wisely chosen to let neither the
cruel nor the sensitive elements
over-run each other. They exist

.coincidence

side by side,.as in real life. The
viewer will begin to empathize with
the/mother, until she comes out
with a tasteless joke about her
invalid charge or her children.
Then she becomes as frightened
and uncertain as her daughters and
we are pulled toward her once
more.

The settings look frail and out of '

balance, as though threatening to
cave in on the characters. This is
consistent with the script--the
characters are just waiting for
things to crumble totally for them.

Alimon Depicts ‘Reel Life’ in ‘Thieves’

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

Robert Altman has an original,
fresh way of directing movies. His
ﬁlms give audiences new outlooks
for routine movie plots. Altman’s
ﬁrst big hit, M*A*S*H, was a
satirical comedy that poked fun at
the military. McCabe and Mrs.
Miller, his second smash ﬁlm was a
bizarre western concerning an
ambitious and amoral rogue. Both
ﬁlms distinctly stand out among
“war movies” and “westerns."

Both Altman movies in their own
way duplicate real life closer than
any other war film or western to’
date. Gone were the cliches,
caricatures, stereotypes and same
old plots that characterize war
movies and westerns.

Similarly, Altman’s newest ﬁlm,
Thieves Like Us, stands out among
gangster movies with an identity of
its own. Director Altman gives
movie audiences an opportunity to
view crime capersin a new light.
Again as in M*A*S*H and McCabe
and Mrs. Nliller, his .new ﬁlm
comes the closest to depicting real
life--this time in gangster movies.

In short, Thieves Like Us is a

Keith Carradine and Shelley Duvall in scene from Robert Altman’s
latest film, Thieves Like Us.

picture about a trio of criminals
who escape from a prison in the
Deep South during the Depression.
Once out of prison, they go on a

bank robbing spree. In between
holdups, Bowie (Keith Carradine)
romances the lonely, meek Keetch-
ie (Shelley Duvall):

In the ﬁlm, Altman doesn’t

, concentrate on action, high speed
chases and bloodbaths which-

characterize ﬁlms like Bonnie and
Clyde and The Getaway. In
addition, he leaves out the careful
planning sequences and the actual
execution of the robbery scheme

~ that dominated movies like The Hot

Rock. _ /
Instead, Altman concentrates on
the personal lives of the pro-
tagonists and the forces that guide
them and society during the time
period. The Depression South in
contrast was a dull, static society.

_Vividly, he portrays the.boredom
and emptiness of the Deep South.

Altman would have you believe
the bleak future and hard realities
of poverty drive the trio to robbing
banks and the robberies give the
trio a sense of pride they can’t ﬁnd
by going clean.

When they aren’t robbing banks, 4

the three fall into a humdrum cycle
of dull, aimless living--that is until
one of the trio, Bowie, starts his
romance with Keetchie, the moth-
erless daughter of a drunken
father. Bowie’s notorious bank
robbing serves to doom ' the
romance. _ .

The movie’s powerful climax
comes when a group of redneck
Dixie sheriffs spray Bowie’s motel
room with a volley of shotgun ﬁre
while the pregnant Keetchie, held
back by the motel manager, looks
on.

He also holds all the school records
for rebounds, percentage shooting,
assists and steals. He had a single
game scoring high of 45 points in
his career total of 1,662.

He was named Scholastic Maga-
zine All-American, Associated

Playoffs

“They are a much improved hockey
club. They just made it into the
playoffs but they won the seventh
game in each series on the road."

Dineen said the Cougars are
similar to the Aeros. “They have
three strong lines and they are a
good penalty killing team,” he
said. '

The second game of "the series
will be played May 15 in Chicago
and the -next three will be in
Houston May 17, 19 and 20. A
sixth game, if necessary, would be
in Chicago May 22 and a seventh in
Houston May 24.

Chicago wrapped up its semiﬁnal
series with Toronto Monday night
but the Aeros will have had a
12-day break by the time they play
Sunday. Dineen said he would give
the Aeros today off.

“It's difficult to keep the players
sharp with such a long layof ,"
Dineen said.’ "I told them to come
back Thursday ready for three hard
days of work leading into Sunday's
game."

Dapper Dan Roundball Classis in
Pittsburgh.

This weekend Harris will be a_
member of the. United States
All-Star team which will play in the
Kentucky Invitational -Classic
against the Indiana-Kentucky All-
Stars. '

Besides basketball, Harris starr-
ed in football and track. He was
named All-State in both sports last
year, but gave up football this
season to concentrate on basket-
ballf

“Larry was one of the top
prospects on our list,” a pleased
Pitt coach Buzz Ridl noted. “We
were hoping to get a forward who is
an offensive threat and has great
jumping ability. He is outstanding
in both of those areas, plus'he
possesses the talent we like in our
defense."

Harris’ high school coach, Bob
Walsh, was also pleased with the
decision. Walsh is a former
Bellvue [Pa.] resident and played
his high school basketball at North
Catholic High in Pittsburgh.

“All the recruiting and work with
the college coaches is over, but it
really didn't seem like work or a lot
of bother to me," Walsh said. “It
never is when you're working with
a person like Larry Harris. He gave
us a lot of his time and effort."

“Such schools as Notre Dame
and Pitt wanted to talk to him about
football--he‘s_a wide receiver. He
thought about playing both sports
last summer, but decided to
concentrate on one--basketball.

“I think Larry was impressed
with the atmosphere in Pittsburgh.
I-Ietold me that he just felt at home
there. Here at Clearview we're
pretty close and he saw the same
thing there in Pittsburgh. When
Coach Grgurich recruited Larry, he
always spoke to Larry Harris the
person, not Larry Harris the
basketball machine. I think that
played a big part in Larry's
decision."

event: Eleven of the competitors in a

this event have been time in less
than 22 seconds. the best being
Burton and Alfred Daley of Seton
Hall at 20.6.

In the distance races, the milers
appear capable of a
minute effort. Four runners from
Villanova top the list of entries in
this event, headed by John Harnett
with a 4:00 personal best. Brian
McElroy owns his’ team’s worst
time at 4:04.

Pitt’s own Bill Rea highlights the
field events with his world class
efforts in the long jump. He’ll be
challenged by Purdue’s Jeff Bolin
who has jumped 26-6 1/2 this
season. Rea’s personal best is 26-7
1/2. Also two 7-0 high jumpers are
entered--Panther Tim Riley and
Kent State’s Robert Francis.

“Overall, this is the best
competition we’ve ever had,” says
meet director Jim Banner, Pitt's
head coach. “We will~have fewer
teams this year, butmore quality.
Our goal in the meet is to provide
top competition so that athletes can
qualify for their conference or
national championships. But most
importantly, we’re out to build up
the sport of track in the‘ Pittsburgh
area.”

Sprinters like Purdue’s Burton

‘can help do that job. The junior

from Milfa, Va., began his track
career in 1972. With no‘ previous
experience, he ran to the NCAA
200-meter title, earned’ a spot on

the U. S. Olympic team, and then

ﬁnished fourth in the 200‘ at
Munich.
At one time Burton shared the

indoor 60-yard dash record a 5.9

ittlnvrtational ’HostsAll Star Cast 

and last year he won the Big Ten
100-yard dash title at 9.4. He will
be challenged in the 100 this year
by such runners as Daley [Seton
Hall, 9.4], Harry Blake [West
Virginia, 9.5], Artie Owens [West
Virginia, 9.5.], and Mike Sands
[Penn State, 9.5.].

Another Olympian, Jacques Ac-
cambray of Kent State, will
compete in the hammer throw. He
was a member of the French,
Olympic team and is an NCAA
Champion. . *

So when teams like Villanova,
Purdue, Kent State, Penn State,
Seton Hall, West Virginia, Syra-
cuse, and Cincinnati get together
this weekend with,Pitt, the result of
several events will be the best
times and distances ever recorded
in the Steel City.

Competition will begin at 6:30
P.M. Friday in the Stadium with
trials in the ‘100, 440, 220, 880, 440
relay, 440 intermediate hurdles,
pole vault, and high jump. Finals

-will be held Friday evening in the

six-mile run, ’discus, and the triple

Saturday morning additional
trials will start at 11 A.M. in the
100, 120 high hurdles, 220, javelin,
shot put, and hammar. The main
part of the meet, Saturday
afternoon's ﬁnals, will start at 2

advantages or not, the Boston
Celtics are taking nothing for

’The Celtics, with Dave Cowens
and John Havlicek each scoring 28
points, beat the Milwaukee Bucks
96-87 here Tuesday night for a 3-2
lead in the [National Basketball
Association championship playoffs.

They can clinch their ﬁrst title
since 1969 by winning in Boston
Friday night.

Hockey

Meeting
The Pitt Hockey Club, three-time
championsof the Western Penn-
sylvania Intercollegiate Hockey
Association (WPIHA), will hold a
players’ meeting on Monday, May
13, from.7:30 to 9:30 pm _in room
130 Trees Hall. The purpose of the

meeting is to plan for the 1974-75
season and present WPIHA All-

Star awards to Dennis Browne-

(Baldwin), Charles Hagins (Johns-
town), Glenn Hyde (Lexington,
Mass.) and Rick Vernon (Pitts-
burgh). Vernon will also receive
the Most Valuable Player Award
from the WPIHA. All new and
returning players are urged to
attend the meeting. For further
information contact:, Mr. Len
Barcalow 364-0693 or Dr. Michael
Sherman 624-4383.

“It’s a strange, strange series,”
said Boston guard Jo Jo White.
“There’s just no such thing as a
home court advantage. But make
no mistake. We’re glad to be going
back to Boston.”

Visiting teams have won three of
five games in the series so far, a
fact of some consolation to Bucks’
Coach Larry Costello.

\

“I like to think in my own mind .
' that we will be back in Milwaukee

to play on Sunday," Costello said.

“I hope it’s in the players’ minds,
too._ You can't expect to have two
performances as bad back-to-back

in playoff competition.”

A Bucks’ victory Friday would
return the series here for the
deciding game Sunday.

The Bucks appeared to have
shifted momentum their way with a
n 97-89 victory last Sunday in
Boston. In that game, they
neutralized Boston’s pressure de-
fense, by starting 6-foot-7 backup
forward Mickey Davis at guard,
creating a height mismatch in the
backcourt. Davis frequently took
the 6-3 White to the baseline and
shot over him for 15 points.

There had been speculation the
Celtics would adjust by switching
the 6-5 Havlicek from forward to
play Davis at guard. But White

again was matched with Davis .

Tuesday night and held him to
seven points.

Irish Working To Remain On T

Throughout his college coaching

career, Ara Parseghian has been
‘quite fond of the old cliche that it is
much more difficult to stay on top
than it is to get there in the first
place. No one would know more
about this than coach Parseghian
who has led Notre Dame to an
85-15-4 record and two national
championships over the past ten
years.

The Fighting Irish are just now
coming down from one of their best
seasons ever, an 11-0 record which
was easily good enough to capture
the national title. They battered
there for over 4900 total yards and
382 points while giving up just 2000
yards and a little over one
‘touchdown a game. So Notre Dame
has once again risen to the top and
Parseghian is directing all his
energies into keeping them there.

At first glance the Irish appear
pretty well set for next year with 33
lettermen returning, including the
most outstanding backﬁeld in the
history of the ‘school. This

‘All-American backﬁeld is led by

senior quarterback Tom Clements
who was responsible for 1242 yards
last season, an average of 8.3 yards
per play. He completed over 50 per
cent of his passes for 882 yards and
eight scores while adding 360 yards
and four touchdowns on the
ground. After leading the Irish to a
19-3 record in his two years as
starting quarterback, Clements will
be considered a deﬁnite Heisman
Trophy candidate in 1974.

The remainder of the returning
backﬁeld consists of Eric Penick,
who combines speed and size to
tear holes in the opposing defense;
Art Best, .’a junior who totaled 700
yards and a 5.9 average last
season; and Wayne Bullock, the
team’s leading ground gainer a
year ago with 752 yards. It was
Bullock who destroyed the Pan-

only tight end Dave Casper and
guard Frank Pomarico will have to
be replaced. Defensively, there are
more holes to fill -with’ the
graduation of defensive backs Mike
Townsend and Tim Rudnick,
middle guard Gary Potempa, and
tackle George Hayduk‘.

“We’re going to employ multiple
defense, utilizing both even and
odd fronts," explains Parseghian.
“And we'll be working very hard
on defensing the option. The
noseguard position vacated by
Potempa is a crucial spot and we
hope we can find someone that will
be just as effective as Gary was."

Perhaps the only weakness in the
Fighting Irish attack will be found
in the kicking game. Both punter
Brian Doherty and placekicker Bob
Thomas ranked in the top ten in the

nation in their specialties last’

season but have since graduated to
the NFL. Parseghian has always
placed special emphasis on a good

kicking game giving it top priority «

in his overall plans. He will not
only have to find two new kickers
but also a center to handle the
snaps of departed Joe Alvarado.

With the type of talent that the
Notre Dame football program
attracts, coach Parseghian should-
n't have too much difficulty in
keeping his team at the level of
success that they have achieved
over the past ten years. He has his
priorities set for the spring and
began drills with a note of caution
which he considers the most
important lesson to be learned
during the preseason.

“Just because,we were success-
ful last year, and a player had a

good year won't mean he will be

last-minute goal gave the Boston
{Bruins a 3-2 victory over the
Philadelphia Flyers in the opener of

Cup ﬁnals, says “Philly played a

“We know they're a good team.
Bums don't get this far," the star
 ‘fenseman said Wednesday. His
30-foot shot with 22 seconds on the
clock Tuesday night kept the game
from going into overtime.

..The Flyers meet the Bruins again

night, with Philadelphia Coach
Fred 'Shero pondering the Flyers’
'8 straight losses in Boston.

‘:‘I think having lost to Boston so

somewhat,” Shero said. “We have

that we can beat them. We have to
believe it.”

Shero ﬁgures if Philadelphia

“can even the series after four
games, we'll have a lot more
conﬁdence. We’re as good a club
as Boston--I know that. We'll just
have to convince ourselves.”

For a while, anyhow, Boston
almost seemed convinced.

Until the last minute, the Flyers
held the Phil Esoposito--Ken
Hodge--Wayne Cashman big line
to only four shots on Philadelphia
goaltender Bernie Parent.

But Esposito said Philadelphia's

,, defense around the goal ultimately

cost the Flyers the game. “Every
time I went near the slot, they had
someone come in the slot to take
me out of the play."

In the last seconds, Ross
Ionsberry “came over in the slot
and took me out of the play on

said. ‘ ,

the play. Bobby was his check.”
But what happened to the
ﬁghting Philadelphians, the sea-

son’s most-penalized team, who

brawled their way to a 4-3 semiﬁnal
series victory over the New York
Rangers?

Perhaps the Flyers were tired
after their grueling, seven-game
series against New York. Or

perhaps they are whistling a
different tune. .

Said Philadelphia’s Dave Shultz:
‘‘I don’t think it will be a big
ﬁghting series.”

But Shultz isn't ready to play
patty-cake.

"‘I think we're going to do a little
hitting," he said, “but no more
than we have to."

 

KEN HODGE, being restrained by the officials, let his temper loose

in a better form Tuesday night by feeding Bobby Orr the puck from
behind the Flyers’ net with just 22 seconds left in the game and Orr

ﬁred it home.

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. AP - As
if Penn State's football team
doesn't give opponents enough
trouble, the Nittany Lions have a
potential secret weapon lurking on
campus - hypnotism.

Dr. G. Thomas Tait, assistant
professor of health and physical
education, said Tuesday he has
successfully used hypnotism 'to
help increase athletes’ self-
confidence.

The Lions have not tapped Dr.
Tait’s talents and they are not
likely to since the NCAA frowns on
hypnosis, he says. Not that the
players should have any reason to
lack confidence in their perform-
ance on the ﬁeld. Over the past
seven years Penn State has rolled
up a 70-8-1 record and ranked in
The Associated Press Top Ten six
times.

_ But if Coach Joe Paterno has any
laggards lurking on his squad, Dr.
Tait says hypnosis could help them
play up to their abilities.

- “It can also be used for those

SYRACUSE, N.Y. AP--The
Syracuse Eagles of ‘the American
Hockey League announced today
the purchase of -two players from
the St. Louis Blues’ organization.

Bill Charles, general manager of
the new Syracuse club, said the
Eagles purchased Gary Gresdal,
27, a left wing and defenseman,
and forward Pete Slader, 25. Both
played for Denver of the Western
Hockey League last season.

players who perform well in
practice but who freeze or choke up
during competition," he said.

He emphasized that hypnosis

‘can help the most in sports that

require many psychological factors-
sports like baseball, basketball,
and foorball. He said these team
sports require complex co-ordina-
tion, which increased self-confi-
dence can help.

“Most people view hypnosis in
sports very negatively,” Dr. Tait
said. “Many ‘major sports
conferences and athletic associa-
tions, including the National
Collegiate Athletic Association and
the Olympic Committee, have
hypnosis on the same taboo lists as
certain drugs."

He admits that hypnosis can be
misused in sports by allowing an
athlete to participate under hyp-
nosis, or using it to ward off
fatigue.

“But hypnosis is a tremendous,
positive, powerful force, if used
correctly,” Dr. Tait said.

HOUSTON AP--A couple of
hometown boys--Homero Blancas
and John Mahaffey--rank high
among the list of favorites in the
$150,000 Houston Open Golf
Tournament. .

The 72-hole event gets underway '

field. of the famous going after a
trimmed-down purse.

This tournament . offered
$205,000 in total prizes last year,
one of the richest on the tour. But
it failed to attract the glamour
names and very unusually in this
area of sky-rocketing purses--the
sponsors cut back on the money
this season.

Most of the great names still are
missing from the 144-man ﬁeldthat
includes 51 qualifiers.

The Houston event immediately
precedes next week's Colonial
National--the first of the newly
designated tournaments in which
leading players must compete.
Many of the game’s top attractions
are taking off this week to rest and
attend to business commitments.

Johnny Miller is in"Japan on
