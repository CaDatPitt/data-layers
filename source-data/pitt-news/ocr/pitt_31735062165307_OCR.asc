_A'relatively quiet campaign has brought forth
speciﬁc and positive party platforms for this year’s
student elections to be held today. in the Commons

Three planks in each platform are alike  pur-
pose according to the previously published state-'

The establishment of year-round political parties to
replace the weaker, pre-election parties, now pro-
vided for by election committee rules; re-'eva_lua-
tion and revision of the present student'government
system, and the slating and support of both inde-
pendent and fraternity men by all three parties.

All planks in this year’s’ platforms are more .
speciﬁc than those of last ?ear’s campaigns indi-
cating a trend toward stronger party responsibility
’ -and promising a more active administration regard-

Last year, the ﬁrst for political parties at Pitt,
all platforms "promised “to work toward” or “to
press for” such things as “improved co-educational
activities” and “the construction of a -swimming
pool for University students.” This year the planks
offer “to provide positive improvement in govern-.
ment” by recognizing ﬁrst the need for “re-evalua-
tion of the fundamental duties of student govern-
ment” rather than the “attempt to-improve govern-
ment by slating more qualiﬁed candidates.” -

Pitt’s Student Congress was
established to promote_ the
extra—curricular education of
the undergraduate student
body. It tries to establish co-
operation between students
and members of the faculty
by means of major University
committees and to provide an
outlet for-student interest outside
the classroom. It contains repre-
sentatives of both WSGA and
Men’s Council and is the overall
spokesman for students? on cam-
pus.

The members of Studen’; Con-
gress must be full time undergrad-
uate students. They must have a
1.5 Q.P.A. for the semester pre-
ceding elections’

Eighteen students, ten men and

"eight women will be elected by the‘

entire student body . today for
Congress. while eight students

serveas representatives of various 4

orgafﬁzations.

Of the men, four _are seniors,
three are juniors and three are
sophomores. Of the eight women,
there are three from the Junior
and Senior Classes and two from
the Sophomore Class.

In ordei to vote at today’s
elections which began at 9:30
this. morning, students must
present student I. D. cards.
Elections are being held in the
Commons Room and New En- ‘
gineering Building. Polls will
