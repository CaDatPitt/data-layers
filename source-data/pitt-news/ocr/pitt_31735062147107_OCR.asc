Regular Edition

Undivided Faith
1 In 0ne’s Country
Seen Out Of Date

Carl I-Iambro, Delegate To‘ League,
Tells Assembly, “Nations Must
Cooperate Or Disappear”

By Sydney Horovitz

Is it possible for the international
world to have a rule of the people, by
the people, and for the people?

This is the
League of Nations must solve, accord-
ing to Carl Joachim Hambro, who ad-
dressed the general assembly in Me-
morial Hall during the fourth hour
ye'sterday.

,Mr., Hambro, Norway's principal

‘delegate to the League, insisted that
_.we must demand the
' principles in the international as in

same mental

the national world. “Under modern
conditions” he declared, “civilization
must work in solidarity or disappear.
The slogan, ‘My country. right or
wiong,’ must be abandoned. ~We must
come to expect from statesmen
throughout the world the will to think
and feel and act for nations every-
where rather than for one native con-
stituency.”

The promise for the future lies with
the young generations to move their
goals onward unceasingly and to_
reach the state previously considered
impossible, the speaker revealed.

The League of Nations faces a mo-
ment of supreme importance because
it is acting up to its obligations, ac-
cording to Mr, Hambro, member of the
executive ' committee,
The League has gradually succeeded
in getting the 57 member nations
marching together, and its difficulty
lies in keeping them in step, he as
serted.

Danger in Lethargy

Mr. Hambro pointed out that the
present action is not being forced by
any particular nation, since unanimous
approval is necessary for all decisions
of the group. , Declaring that the dan-
ger lies not in rashness, but in lethar-
gy. he said: _

“The proposals for blockading the
seaboard of recalcitrant nations and
cutting off their food supply are not
rash decisions of the present moment.
They were adopted by the League in
1921.”

Turning hack to 1910, the Norwe-
gian parliamentarian read a resolu-
tion of the United States appointing a
peace commission of ﬁve members.
The commission was authorized to use
any existing international organization
in order to help preserve the peace
of the nations, and to diminish the ap-
propriations for military preparation.

“At present there exists such an
international organization.” Mr. Ham-
bro pointed out. “It operates on a to-
tal budget of nine million dollars a
year. Only three per cent of the to-
tal sum of military appropriations
which t-he United States expends for
the year would be sufficient to pay a
possible American contribution to the
League for a far distant future.”

Expenses Exaggerated

The speaker decried the exa.ggera-
tions of the expenditures attributed to
the League, insisting that it.s hospital-
ity was chieﬂy “moral and mental.”

“The League of Nations is the most
wonderful international organization
which has ever existed,” Mr. Hambro
declared. “Wherever its experts have
been allowed to work out their own
decisions unhampered by political
prestige or by powerful nations_ it has
had complete success. The Council
and Assembly, having no power to en-
force their decisions, have been able
competently to give advice and rec-
ommendations to various govern-
ments, But the Council and Assembly
are merelyshow-windows. The ex-
pert work is chieﬂy done not by ‘the
distinguished leaders, but by the zeal-
ous underlin'gs.”_-

“We are. apt to forget that the
League accomplishes humanitarian

vwork other than that for »pe,'ac'e," the
"speaker warned.

“The Health Sec-
tion was the first to start international
work, by helping to check diseases
which were spreading all over Asia,
Europe, and surrounding sections.
There are at least one million people
in.Europe today without official coun-
try or citizenship, and with no politic-
al right to existence but that of a
League passport. ‘Controlling the dis-
tribution of narcotics and drugs, laws
for the solution of transportation dif-
ﬁculties are also international prob-
lems of the League.”

The League of Nations has needed
Americans to advertise it, decided
Mr. fHam'bro, who, ranks officially in
his own country as second only to the
king.  "

\OnIy 19 Days Remain
For 605 Owl Portraits

VVe don’t know how many
shopping days are left until
Christmas, but only 19 days are
left for seniors to have their
pictures taken for the ’36 Owl.

And out of 650 seniors, just
45 had posed by Monday morn-
mg.

Mr. Babit is still sitting. The
camera is collecting dust and
ﬂy specks. But nothing hap-
pens.

Not only are the Pitt students
to have their pictures taken
there, but also the Carnegie
Tech students, which should
make a merry riot at the end
of the allotted time.

orary tappees, men not necessarily
connected with the University, and
not more than four faculty members,
who will become associates of the
circle.

Men named at the tapping will be
inductedat an initiation immediately
preceding the Founder’s Day banquet
the evening of December 2. A ban-
quet committee consisting of N. Rob-
ert Seidle, chairman, and Fred Kiger,
C36, and Israel Goldberg, C36, are
preparing for the event.

At two meetings _this month, mem-
bers will vote upon candidates for
entrance. A student nominating com-
mittee led by Ellis Tumpson, BA36,
and the associate-honorary non1inat-
ing group headed by Herrymon
Maurer, C36, are reporting their rec-
cmmendations.

Following the annual tradition, a
large-scale reproduction of the ODK
key will be placed on the lawn near
State Hall the day of tapping. Each
half-hour during the morning, a new
name will be posted on the key.

syncopation of Archie Bleyer’s music,”
said Schultz when asked the reason

' for the cancellation of a grand march.

100 Coed Hostesses~-Chosen‘
For Dance Honoring Army

 

West Point Cadet Corps Invited To Ball Saturday Night;
Upperclass Women Named As Dancing Partners

A gentleman from the United States Military Academy, West
Point, wrote to the Chamber of Commerce the other day. He said
he lived in the Mid-west, didn’t know anyone in Pittsburgh, and
would be very happy if the boys ﬁxed him up with a date for the,
Army Ball. In a straiglitforward, crisp style that would do credit to

any English theme, the cadet described himself
ﬁve feet, seven inches, good dancer, and

brown eyes, and excellent morals.

the meeting and the commission’s
preceding dinner, scheduled for 5:30
o’clock.

At the open session, to start at 7
o’clock, committees will make their
reports, plans for the year’s new
women’s projects will be discussed,
and a program featuring a series of
‘skits on campus activities leaders
will be presented.

room committee and the poster com-
mittee. ' . '

The organization’s part in the com-
ing Campus Chest Drive, preliminary

Technical Staff
Prepares Props
For ‘Show-Off’

Vi-"itli November 14, the date set for
presentation of “The Show-Off” by
Pitt Players, only a week and a. day
oh‘, members of the technical staff are
sweating and fretting overtime in
their shop on the second ﬂoor of the
old red brick house below the Sta-
dium.

Although scenery and props being
used for the show are, with one ex-
ception, those that have been accru-
ing through 15 years, a complete
renovation is necessary in most cases,
according to Charles Foreman, gradu-
ate assistant in drama.tics. This in-
volves scraping off old paint, apply-
ing sizing (a glue and water mixture),
and applying several coats of new
paint.

Technical staff workers have been
on the job every da.y from 3:30 to
5:30 o’clock. No diﬂiculty is antici-
pated in having everything ready for
the performance.

Engineers Insure
Rides For Dance

Shepherd’s 'I'ra.nsportat.i.on B%u.re:a.n
Will Solve Dancers’ P'roble1o's

The ﬁrst Eiigincering Asr.-'oc.’iai.ion
dance comes one week from l7rida,y.

The Grotto is the place, with Baron
Elliott providing the music. ~

E-(lwarcl Sl1e;)he_rd, IE36, is chair-4

man.
All of which is entirely irrelevant
and immaterial to the fact that the
engineers have organized a. ride bu-
reau. Froin now on every engineer
who has no car or ride to the E./X
dance has merely to see his junior
representative, and a ride will be ob-
tained, for him. , p .. .
 Concerning the ride bureau, Shep-
“T_hos.e.;-ride arrange-

of the greatest undertakings on the
_University campus, especiallysince
it’s being engineered by engineers.
W'e engineers used to put on the onlry
one-dollar dance on campus, but since
other groups have adopted tliaif idea.
we had to think up something new.
and here it is!” .

At any rate the dance will be held
Friday, November 15, at the Grotto,
and Baron Elliott will play, whether
or not.

Spirit In Costume
TIIERE Is SOMETHING UNUSUAL at Pitt

- ._-about those posters, tacked up on campus bill- _

 boards, which start off to read, “Maul the
Mule.”—- -The “Mule,” to be explicit,'designates
the Army team and the “Maul” appears to be
nothing more than an alliterate brainchild.

 I't*h-asalways seemed the case that when stu-
dents of one school plaster their billboards with in-
spired slogansand bedeck their fraternity houses
with challenging words and symbols, or crowd
t=h'e_i_r newspaper with fervent “Beat Whosis”
plea-s, then you- may well conclude that the foot-
b‘a~ll,team from that school doesn’t stand a cha.nce
in the world of winning that particular game.

._ All the fervor to “Beat Somebody” vanishes
very‘ quickly after the game and leaves the stu-
dents happy that the team held down the score.
Stuff like that doesn’t seem to ﬁt into the scheme
of-_;things at-Pitt. -These Panthers are nobody’s
pushover, they’re going to show the Army boys
the -‘battle of their lives. In every Pitt heart there
is]-lal strong feeling that this time the Panther i
reallygoing to do. some marauding. - -

'_It’s somewhat unfortunate that we ’ll have the
mule all mauled long before the boys get down
there on the ﬁeldto settle this business actually.
Vlfe. can hope that the Panthers won’t interpret
the signs about campus as the gestures of only
a slightly hopeful student body, to whom a vic-
tory over the team being played would mean a
football holiday, undying glory, and another pig-
skin fo.r the trophy case.

This does not mean to detract in any way from
the spirit being shown already in ‘regard to.Fri-
day’s pep meeting. Pep meetings are good things,
if only because they bring the cheering student
body together at close range and enable it to fa-
miliarize itself with the techniques for the school
songs -and -cheers: These, then, may be run off
without the disconcerting inﬂuence of an engi-
ncer’s knee in your back or-a mustard-dripping
hot dog passing along the row. 1 _ .

The Student Faculty Association is anticipating
a .big turnout for its aﬁair Friday. Elaborate
preparations have been made; all that is necessary
now.-, is for the student body to turn out en masse
and" to cooperate whole-heartedly in delivering
those songs and cheers. Vast improvements will
have to be effected if the Pitt rooting sections are
to stand -much of a show Saturday. -

"Without a doubt, the odds against Jock Suther-
land’s -charges in the Army game are not nearly
so long asthe odds against the Pittsburgh- students
outcheering the ‘West Point Cadets. A good pep.
meeting Friday will be a start. - '

That Band Again

Although the Panther gridmen came away from
New York Saturday with a slightly disappointing
scoreless tie in their game with Fordham, the day
was not altogether lost. Reports indicate that the
University Band _1nade an impression second .to
none among bands appearing in New York this
year. 1 ', .
According to the Herald-Tribune: “The fanciest
marching. of-_ the day was done by Pitt ’s 120-piece
brass. -band in blue and gold uniforms. No ba.nd
visiting here this year willoutdor Pi-tt’s musicians.
They, marclied; and counter—marched, spelled tout
Pitt and ‘Rfor Fordham, and played ~thj'e stirring
‘Hail to-Pitt’ song.."’” - - I ' ,‘ - . — . -.

Several other New York papers took space on
tl1eir'-sport--pages to heap, laurels upon the Univer-
sity musicians. Joe \Villiams, ace columnist for
the ‘World-Telegram, acclaimed the band as one
of th‘c‘ﬁne"st‘organizations that he has ever seen.

University ‘observers at the game stated that
after the ﬁnal whistle had blown, many of tl1’e.38,-
000'-spectators remained in their seats tosee what

 

ithe.Blue and Gold Band would perform as its ﬁnal

maneuver. All overthe Polo Grounds --were heard
favorable comments. A . V A 1
In addition, University oiiicials received ﬁne
comments from the managers of two-of New
York ’s leading hotels for the manner in whichthe
boys conducted themselves during the short stay.-
All this amounts to high praise for those‘ 120 fel-
lows who make up the University Band. - It also
amounts to high praise for Captain Donald C." Tre-
dennick, whose‘ patient ‘coaching and thoroughly
prepared innovations have been responsible for
making the marching unit what it.is. Lee M.

‘Hovde, Kirkpatrick Discuss

City’s Future Before Forum

 

By William Stark
Speaking to a capacity audience -of

the Community Forum at Schenley

High School on Monday night, Dr. B.

J. lHovde, associate professor of his- -

t0I‘Y, and Mr. H. P. Kirkpatrick, presi-

dent of the Pittsburgh Chamber of
Commerce, participated in a symposi-
um on “Has Pittsburgh 2. Future?”

Both men considered different ap-
proaches‘ to this ‘subject: Dr; Hovde,
the sociological side, and Mr. Kirk-
patrick the industrial side. Mr. Kirk-
patrick opened his address by tracing
the industrial development of the
Pittsburgh district; and proposed the
theory of a planned industrial devel-
opment, its effects on and beneﬁts to
the ‘City.

Dr. Hovde considered the less aes-
thetic sides of our community life,
and suggested plans for a reorganiza-
tion with the present political frame-
work. '.He suggested a development
of the Pittsburgh waterfront along
the lines employed by the City of
Chicago, mlunicipal ownership. and
control of all means of transporta-
tion. ,

In speaking of the progress made
so far in housing plans, Dr. Hovde
said, “VVord houses rather than brick
houseshave been constructed up to
the present time.”

In speaking of public health admin-

istration, Dr. Hovde offered county
i,c'onso'lid,ation as a means of aiding
gadmlnistration of public health, and
‘the removal of the system from the
hands of politicians.

In concluding, Dr. Hovde reaffirmed
his belief in the ability of the City to
settle its problems in the American
Way, Democracy. “If advantage is
not taken of this opportunity to read-
just our local problems," D-r. Hovde
concluded, “the denial of the use of
the schools for meeting purposes, the
use of the police, and other restrictive
bodies might be useless-." , . « .

Panthers, As Well As Coeds,
Prepare For Army Invasion

Soldiers Bring Powerful Eleven To Pittsburgh Saturday;
McClure May Start At Quarterback For Pitt

 

 

-\Vhile there a.re approximately 100 Pitt coeds who are more con-
cerned at the present time with thoughts of meeting their cadet es-
corts for the military ball on Saturday evening, up at the practice
ﬁeld there is a slightly smaller "group of the opposite sex‘ who are
primarily interested in getting up a good line of defense to throw
before the future generals when they are formally introduced at the
gridiron‘ affair earlier.‘.ir'1*‘;-the“ day- ' . ’ -

_. The Panthers will have=;pIeI1;ty to
worry about, too, because the 'West
Pointers still cherish bitter memories
of a couple of sad Saturday afternoons
in 1931 and 1932, when Pitt represen-
tatives won decisions .over them. - In
addition to that reason, Coach Gar
Davidson’s forces lost a tough en-
counter to Mississippi State last Sat-
urday. and the cadets would like to
get back the winning complex by tak-
ing the Panthers into camp;

‘Up to the Mississippi State game,
the Cadets-boasted an undefeated
record of four victories. They beat
Vvilliam and Mary, 14-0, Gettysburg,
54-0, Harvard, 13-0, and Yale, 14-8.
Then along came Mississippi State to
blot their cha.rt with a 13-7 triumph.

In preparation for the invaders,
Coach Sutherland will probably spend
a lot of time this week perfecting a
defense to, stop the vaunted aerial at-
tack of the visitors. Army completed
seven passes in last Saturday’s game
to pile up a considerable number of
yards. - » ~

Another shift may be made at the
quarterback post for Pitt. At the
beginning of the season Arnold Greene
seemed to have the edge over Michel-
osen and McClure for -the ﬁrst call,
but in the Waynesburg contest Michel-
osen’s work boosted, him to a. va-
sity berth. Against the -Army, Bob
McClure, who was converted into a~
fullback and later returned to his old
post at quarter, may call the signals;

Otherwise Same Lineup

With the exception of‘the quarter-
back position, the Panthers will line
up_ the same eleven that started last
week, with Sites and Shaw at ends;
Matisi and Detzel at tackles; Glass-
ford and Dalle Tezze at guards; and
Kliskey at center. In the backﬁeld
LaRue, Randour and Patrick, in addi-
tion to McClure, will begin.

Both LaRue and Randour played ex-
ceptionally well against Fordhain,
especially on the defensive. It was
LaRue who stopped Maniaci twice in
the last period when the Ram captain
looked like he was going to break
loose. Hub has been going great guns
all season, and when All-American
pickers start mentioning backﬁeld
candidates, it might be a good idea to
keep in mind this Panther back.

Coach Gar Davidson will bring a
colorful eleven to Pittsburgh, headed
by the new backﬁeld sensation of the
East, Charles “Monk” Meyer. Meyer,
the son of an Army colonel, broke
into the spotlight against Harvard. In
that game. he gained a total of 83
yards which was more yardage than
the whole Crimson team could garner,
and he also tossed four passes which
hit the mark. Against Yale and
Mississippi State, he continued his
brilliant work. ,

The cadets have two of the ﬁnest
ends in the East in Captain Bill
Shuler and Woodie Stromberg. Both
a.re adept pass-receivers and deadly
tacklers. At tackles Coach Davidson
has a pair of big husky lads, Hal
Wolf and Erik Eriksen; and Stan
Smith and Conrad Necrason, both let-
termen, ﬁll the guard posts. -Tom
Clifford, veteran pivot player, handles
the center duties. ‘

Bill Grohs, letterman, calls signals
for the cadets, Whitey Grove and
Monk Meyer share the halfback posi-
tions, and Carl Goldenburg does the
full-backing for the soldiers.

The third man in this group at the
Akron training -plant is Robert-.Wei-
tershausen,,.me_m.ber of the Pitt Riﬂe
team -for two gyears. .  .. .. 

Munjas, .-.who_=.-captained the All
Star, ag_gregation=, and.Shotwe1l stand in
the-ﬁrst ﬁve as a result of their. high
weekly test grades. They have fallen
below the required mark of 93 only
once, both having scored in the 80's
on a make-up exam following the
Chicago grid classic. Some of the
pointson the quizzes are: personality,
initiative, cooperation, behavior, lead-
ership, and intelligence.

At times, their work is even quite
dangerous. On one occasion, Shotwell
reported he was pinned to the wall
by a heavy conveyor. On stillanother,
a car loaded with heavy tires slipped
the rails, headed for his “cubby-hole”
position in the stone wall; Leaping
quickly, he narrowly averted the mov-
ing car as it crashed into the wall
sending a spray of rubber tires
bounding off the walls and tracks.

Shotwell, in town for the Pitt-Penn
Statetclash, commented that he saw
just what, he expected‘ from the
“sophomore team” in this early stage.
Quite convinced that Dr. Sutherland
will again have a ball club tough to
whip in November and for the re-
mainder of the season, George reg-
istered--a big grin of contentment
while mentioning “1936 and 193.7, rel-
ative to the current Panther crop.”.

When interviewed, Shotwell claim-
ed, concerning Sutherland, "You don’t
realize how exceptionally good the
old boy is unti1..you see. other college

coaches. The more coaching I observe

since graduation, the greater he be-
comes in‘. my estimation.” Munjas
shares this opinion, George added.
Commenting on the All Star game
with the Bears, Shotwell‘ termed pro
ball “the biggest loafing game in the
world”~as~a result of his experience
with the game. It is quite different
from collegeball, he believes, being a.
great deal easier. While running
down a punt early inithe game, a

blocker in the pro secondary told him

“to take it easy,-the receiver won’t be
in.too much of a hurry.” . .. .. -
“The only man you hit hard," he
continued, “is the ball-carrier.‘ And
blocking was of the cream-puff
variety, just a matter of resting your
hands on the other man.” As to the
players, he found Hutson a ﬁne pass
receiver, yet not too. strong defensive-
ly-. Purvis, though injured, impressed
him among the backs. ~
However, he emphatically stated
“I would not trade one man on last
year’s Pitt varsity for all the All-
Americans and stars assembled and
in action at Chicago.” Kostka‘(re-'
member Minnesota?) was “good of-
fensively, yet his blocking, tackling,
and defense were weak.” .
Shotwell urges college students,
and football men in particular,» to
narrow their college study to a par-
ticular. ﬁeld, with a deﬁnite job in
mind,.if possible. From his own ex-
perience, he pointed out that the spe-
cialist had greater opportunities and
easier going than one not prepared
particularly for work in that scope.

ﬁrst time this year at a University _
event when campus women bring out‘

their formals tonight for the Pan-
hellenic reception in honor of fresh-
man women.

8 to 10 o’clock at Heinz House. Betty
Kelley, C37, vice president of Pan-
hellenic and social chairman, is in
charge of arrangements.

ing are: Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women; Helen Poole Rush, assistant
dean of women; Margaret Chalmers,
Ed36, president of Panhellenic; Jean
Lawson. C37, secretary; and Louise

Miss Elle11 M. eeyer, professor of
English and education; Miss Blossom
L Henry, assistant professor of mod-
ern languages, and Dr. Lotte Lohs-
toeter, assistant professor of modern
languages, will pour.

The University trio consisting of
Helen Meeker, pianist; Geraldine Gal-
lagher, violinist; and Frank Crispen,
cellist, will play.

Ten members from each women’s
fraternity on campus including men-
tors and Panhellenic representatives
will act as hostesses.

Committees for the reception in-
clude: Group 1. Marion Messer,
Ed37, chairman, Dorothy Miller, C36,
Marcella Leyton, C37, Dorothy Zim-
merman, C37, Grace Seifert, Ed36,

Refuses To Talk
About Its Brunch

won't

 

The Customs Committee
talk!

Plans for the Football Brunch to be
given before the Pitt-Nebraska game
by the Customs Committee of W'SGA
in Heinz House are being kept a se-
cret. About the only thing the in-
quiring Pitt News reporter could drag
out of several members of the com-
mittee was a promise that the fresh-
man women will probably like the en-
tertainment.

The ﬁrst Brunch for freshman
women took place on campus last
year. Heinz House was decorated
with college pennants, footballs, and
festive '-ornaments. Even the Pitt
Panther made his appearance, had his
picture drawn by Cy Hungerford, car-
toonist, and in general entertained the
ladies handsomely.

Invitations for this year's Brunch
will be distributed to the freshman
women by their senior mentors.

Camels

S'oMalé! You CAN

SMOKE All. YOU WANT

Q There's a bit of friendly guidance
for others in what men like Lott and
Harrison, Buster Crabbe and Sarazen,
say about Camels. They have tested
for mildness -—found that
Camels don’t affect sound wind or
jangle their nerves. So turn to Camels.
You'll ﬁnd real hit-the-spotiﬂavor. 0 C
A distinctive, pleasing taste. Smoke
Camels freely, fopathletes ﬁnd Camels
don’: disturb their "condition.” Cost-
lier tobaccos do ‘make a difference!

Freshmen End Balloting,
Choose Executive Board

for the year.

The executive board consists of
Alfred Barry, M39, and three assist-
ants, Albert Kairys, Ed, Bernard
McKenna_. C, and Robert Culp, Jr., C.

Q If you have searched for cigarette mildness, mark the words of
George Lott, the tennis champion, and the 7-goal polo star, Cyril
Harrison. "Camels,” says Mr. Harrison, "are so mild they don’t upset
the nerves or affect the wind. And when I’m tired I get a ‘lift’ with
a Camel.” And Lott adds: “I understand that more expensive tobac-
cos are used in Camels. Theyiare gentle on the throat. And Camels
never get my wind.” Turn to Camels and enjoy to the full the pleas-
ure that comes from costlier tobaccos. '
