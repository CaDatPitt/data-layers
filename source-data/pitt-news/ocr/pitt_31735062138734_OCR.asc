Our Bonds Will
Buy LST Tank

Pitt is going to buy a medium
tank to mount on the deck of the
landing ship for tanks (LST) pur-
chased by Allegheny County war
bonds: The goal is $45,000, and is
the highest ever set here, exceed-
ing the last goal of $26,000 by $19,-
000. ~

This drive was brought close to
home last Friday at an assembly
where two soldiers ,both wounded
in battle, spoke. Pvt. Charles A.
Rowland, a former Pitt student,
spoke of his experiences in Hawaii,

Independents Meet,
Plan Reorganization

“Why d-on’t we revive the Inde-
pendent Association?”

This question, proposed in an in-
formal Tuck Shop discussion, was
the beginning of the latest develop-
ment in student government. Thus
a formal organization again seeks
to represent the interests of non-
fraternity students. '

Co-chairmen of the new.organiza-
tion are Gerald Stern, C, and Her-
man Feldman, C. In explaining his
‘decision to work for an Independ-
ent organziation Stern said, “I was
greatly shocked to learn that of the
ten men recently nominated for
men’s student government repre-
sentation, nine are fraternity men
——despite the fact that the majority
of students have no fraternity athl-

When questioned on his views on
fraternities, co - chairman ’Feldman
replied, “I believe in fraternities.
However, it is economically impos-
sible for many students to join, and
they should not be excluded from
campus activities for that reason.”

The new organization, which is to
be sponsored by Dr. J. Stanley Gray
of the psychology department met
for the first time on Wednesday at
12:30 o’clock'in room 122 Cathedral.
Polciies on representation and the
proposed constitution for student
government were discussed. Grant
Lee, C, was elected temporary pres-
ident of the new Independent group.

The body.expressed objections to

the constitution. It was termed;
“vague and inadequate.” All inde- 
pendent students, men and women, =

have been invited by the organzi-

ers to join the society. There will E

be a meeting before the elections.

Everyone on campus is invited to ,

CounciLVote
Postponed

Men’s Council decided at its last
meeting to advance the deadline for
petitions for membership to Coun-
cil, and to select the new members
itself.

It had previously been planned to

elect new members for Men’s -Coun- .

cil in the general campus election
next week. However, due to the un-
certainty. of the draft situation, it
was considered best to postpone the
election of new members for two
weeks. The general election system
cannot be used at a later date be-
cause of the difficulty in prepara-
tion and the length of time required.
The ESGC election will, of course,
be held at the planned time.

Because those who had 2-A de-
ferments are now doubtful as to
their draft status, the two-week
delay will allow better considera-
ti-on of the men.

The rules for petitions remain the
same: all properly registered full-
time men students, other than be-
ginning freshmen, in the Schools of
Engineering and Mines and the Col-
lege are eligible for application,
though the draft status of each ap-
plicant will be taken into consider-
ation.

Petitions may be obtained in the
dean of men’s oﬂice from Mrs. Dor-
ﬁeld, to whom the properly complet-
ed petitions should be returned. In
addition to the required information
requested on the petition, applicants
should also state, as accurately as
possible, their draft status, expect-
ed length of future attendance at
the University, and such pertinent
draft information as they can sup-
ply.

Those petitioris already handed
in will be considered together with
any new ones. Those students who
have not ﬁlled a‘ petition, and are
eligible, are. urged to do‘ so, and,

through selection and election, try’

to represent their school in Men’s
Council. There are four vacancies
be ﬁlled: two by men in the

S-chools of Engineering and Mines ;.

two by men in the College.

The deadline for these petitions
is Tuesday, May 2, by which time

Highlight of Spring Festival

will be the Spotlight Bands broad'- V‘

cast featuring the music of Ted-
FioRito and his orchestra, from
the dance floor of Syria Mosque,
May 6. A

Dancing will start at 8:30
o’clock, and the doors will be
closed promptly at 9 o’clock, in
order to prepare for the broadcast
at 9:30 o'clock; no one will be per-
mitted to leave the floor or enter
it between 9 and 10 o’clock. The
band will give a warmup perform-
ance before going on the air.

Coca Cola is sending a script
writer to Pitt this week to work
on the script for the broadcast,

 which will be concerned with Pitt

at war. All students are urged to
be present for the air show. There
is a likelihood that permission may
be granted to extend ldancingu

 Congress  Politic;

from the standpoint of fraternity politics.

~_tual gain.

, This dark side on a somewhatbrighter student govern-
» C: ; menti outlook made itself evident as early as the nominations
 a committee meeting. ESGC ruled that this committee select,
with unbiased intentions, ten men to place before the student
, body. We can see, of course, how the manpower situation
 would affect these selections. Allowances for the war must
' always be considered. But why should the war affect the
length of time which the committee deliberated on possible
candidates? Why should the war permit whispered ﬁrst-
'_“ --choices to be passed around -the nominating table?

But this is only the beginning. '

Last Wednesday afternoon, a grouplof independents, ir-
ritated by the nominationresults, met in one of the first floor
rooms of the Cathedral to map out plans to defeat, not only
the candidates they oppose, but the Student Congress idea
as well. .

g It is doubtful whether the independents can muster
enough votes to smother the student government proposal,
ff  but they will certainly gain enough support to affect individual

' election results. - ~
* =0! *
ESGC worked four weeks on the constitution of this Stud-
’ ent Congress trying to ‘develop a government set-up free of
all fraternity bickerings. At first glance, the emergency
 'group’s clean politics goal seemed to be in sight. Their three-
, vote for the five oflices seemed to have the organized vote
 ‘licked. Events of the last few weeks has proved otherwise,
 ,5 and politics enters the Pitt campus picture again.
i ,_ Perhaps, if the Student Congress is adopted,,we can look
for a gradual clean-up in crooked politics. The Congress idea
of representation of all factions grew with this purpose in
‘mind. We hope it succeeds, but, from past records, they are
“hopes” and nothing more.

Opinion Poll
On War Problems

A post war settlement poll re-
ﬂecting student opinion will be
conducted this week by the Uni-
versity Young Women’s Christian
Association and Women’s Speech
Association. This is being done in
cooperation with the Public Affairs
Newsservice of Washington, which
is interested in the reactions, of
college students on problems of
post war planning.

Opinions are asked upon such
questions as, "After this war, do you
think lasting peace is: probable,
possible, unlikely or impossible——
Should the United Nations (a)
abolish the Nazi party, (b) demo-
blize German army pedmanently,
(c) occupy Germany for several
years, (d) divide. Germany into
small states, (e) prevent rebuild-
ing of German chemical, steel,
automotive industries or (f) make
German labor rebuild devastated
countries at prisoner of war wages
—Would you be willing to con-
tinue rationing to aid Allied and
liberated nations or to aid de-
feated nations. 4
The YWCA chairman is Jean
Swope, and Penn Burke is serv-
ing as the leader for WSA. All
students are invited to participate
in the. poll. They’ may do so at
either the YWCA or YMCA oiﬁces.
A panel discussion will be held
by the groups following tabulation
of the results.

 iMay We Present
Miss Blossom L. Henry

‘By nonomr RUMBAUGE

Other people were taking their daily afternoon siestas, but Miss
Blossom L. Henry, assistant professor of modern languages at the
University, was energetically exploring the city of Manila.

This is quite typical of the gently smiling, popular teacher. She
likes to be “on the go" constantly, as her six visits to France and those

to England, Belgium,‘ Italy, Japan,

and China will verify. (And just

ask her how many times she has <9

crossed the United States from
coast to coast!)
Of the many experiences in Miss
Henry’s travels, one of the most

» memorable occurred during her sea

voyage to Manila. The ship on which
she was traveling was caught in the
tail of a hurricane, and she remained
on deck throughout the worst -of it.
"‘It was a wonderful experience to

A ‘watch the huge waves wash over the

deck,” said Miss Henry. (P. S.—She

_ -.wasn’t even sea-sick!)

The many years she has devoted
to study prove her love for it. She
graduated from the University of
Denver, received her Master’s De-
gree there, studied at Columbia Uni-
yersity a year and a half, and spent
many months in Paris studying. On

 sidlines, studying music has
- been her hobby.

A Ernie Pyle Sees

Pitt jeep In Italy

Nomatter where you are, the odds
are that in some way you’ll hear
about Pitt. This time, the results
of a student drive were brought
home to the University by Roving
Reporter Ernie Pyle in his daily
column.

This time Pyle was roving in It-
aly where he saw one of the “Pitt
Panther” jeeps bought with the War
bonds and stamps subscribed by
students. It seems that Pyle’s hemo-
globin is down to 20 points below
what is required to keep a man
alive so he’s had to have regular in-
jections of liver essence. His latest
pricking at that time was done by
Capt. John R. Grant of Pittsburgh,
who drives one of our jeeps some-
where in Italy.

A year and, four months have
gone by since the stamp and bond
drive committee iniitated their
“J eep-A-Wee ” slogan withkthe ap-
pearance of four jeeps on campus.
Every $500 that was spent for war
bonds or stamps meant another jeep
was marked with the insignia of
the University.

Divide the $45,000 grand total of
last May for the entire drive and
you will ﬁnd that the University's
drive bought 90 jeeps, far surpass-
ing the goal. ,

The University's jeeps appear on
all the war fronts. As a result of
the fourth war bond drive, the com-
mittee was able to purchase thir-
teen “ﬂying jeeps” (a ﬂying jeep is
a $3,000 low ﬂying airplane used
especially by the artillery).

In all of the war drives, student
totals have exceeded_ the commit-
tee's goal. Each jeep that appears
on the War fronts means that stud-
ents on campus are backing the at-
tack.

Grad Gets Award

Among the 91 students to be
awarded"fellowships to the Univer-
sity of Chicago for the year 1944-
45 was Pitt graduate Guy Edwin
Swanson of Erie, Pennsylvania, who
received both his bachelor of arts
and master of arts degrees here.

The award given to Mr. Swanson
was the Marshall Field fellowship
in sociology, which carries with it
the highest stipend of any fellow-
ship conferred.

Mr. Swanson has been a student
at the University of Chicago since
September 1943, making an investi-
gation of the relationships in fam-
ilies of delinquent boys, with em-
phasis on the boy's deﬁnition of
home life.

The fellowship will enable him to
work toward the degree of doctor
of philosophy.

Field Sketches Exhibited
An exhibition of paintings by
Ottmarf}/'on Fuhrer, stall’ artist of
the Carnegie Museum, will be on
display in the department of fine
arts, University of Pittsburgh,
throughout April. The collection is
composed of ﬁeld sketches for dior-
amas, poster designs and other sub-
jects. ‘
The exhibition, in the seventh
ﬂoor gallery of the Cathedral of
Learning, is open to the public.

“How do you ex ect us to be in

_ P _ g
out?” ThlS cry from a prisoner of
the men who, perhaps after only a

major problem is what to do with

New York with a plea direct from
the war prisoners, “Give us some-
thing to do with our minds and
hands!"

In response to this plea, Pitt’s
war activities committee, co-chair-
maned by Virginia Volkay, C, and
Phyllis Rosenﬁeld, C, are planning
an inter-collegiate book drive with
Tech, Mount Mercy, Duquesne, and

 

Pennsylvania College for Women.
Pitt’s drive for text books, stand-
ard works in English literature,
standard detective stories, and lan-
guage books will begin on Monday,
May 8. All books which have pencil
marks erased and labels and book-
plates removed will be accepted a‘
the Book Booth that will be set up
on the Cathedral's ground ﬂoor
through Saturday, May 13. The
World Student Service Fund said
all markings must be removed from
the books because the books are
thoroughly examined by censors be-
fore they leave this country and be-
fore they may enter another coun-
try. The books must be free of all
but the printed word.

“2 Books and a 6" is the slogan
for the “Victory-Book Ball” that
climaxes the book drive on Sat-
urday, May 13. The co-chairmen
of the Ball, Virginia Volkay, C,
and Jean Swope, Ed, explain the
jingle: “ ‘2 Books‘ means that
each couple must bring at least
two volumes for admission to the
Victory Book Ball in the Schen-
ley ballroom. ‘A 6‘ stands for the
six cents worth of postage each
couple going to the ball must
bring with their books."

The Ball co-chairmen further ex-
plained that no tickets will be dis-
tributed at the Schenley. All books,
and postage to pay the shipping
cost of the volumes to New York
will be collected at the Cathedral's
ground floor booth.

Interviews to decide upon the
editor and business manager of
the “Pitt News” next year will
take place next Friday afternoon.
Anyone interested in trying out
can make application in the
“News" Ollice before next Tues-
day.

vested in the U. S. Treasury or war
bonds. .

At Stanton University, Miss Ling-
fu-Yang, Chinese food researchist,
is teaching girls to turn out chry-

abotka Book
[J In .Demzma’

When Professor Walter Sabotka

of Pitt's Bureau of‘ Retail Train-
ing completed his 55-page booklet
in January of 1942 entitled “Identi-
ﬁcation of Fibers and Fabrics,” he
didn't expect the public demand for
it-.to. become as -great and as far-
ﬂung as i-t has.
.. Some..14.foreign companies has
well as many American ﬁrms have
sent orders to the University for the
manual. Most distant customers
have been the Indian Jute Mills As-
sociation in Calcutta, India, and the
Inspectorate of Military Explosives
in Bombay, India.

The Margan - Hinton magazine
agencies of Sidney, Australia, and
a ﬁrm in Wellington, New Zealand,
have requested copies. In addition
there have been requests from Eng-
lish and Canadian, and South Afri-
can ﬁrms. . _

“I wrote the manual -to provide a
simple, readablework on textiles,”
says Mr. Sabotka. “It is a glossary
of textile identiﬁcation facts. This
was the first attempt 6f many tex-
tile books to make a ‘digest of the
facts.”

After completion of the work, Dr.
Jules Labarthe and Dr. A. Frank
Tese, workers in the Commodities
Standards Fellowship maintained at
Mellon Institute by Kaufmann’s de-
partment store, reviewed it and of-
fered corrective suggestions.

With every booklet, the Bureau
of Retail Training sends out a Tex
Test Kit. This is a compact box
containing various liquids, a pair of
scissors, a needle, and other mater-
ials for use in identifying textiles.

Pre—Med Students Urged
To Take Test On April 28

All pre-medical students who
have not taken the medical apti-
tude test are urged’ to take this
test to be given at three o’clock
April 28 in the auditorium of the
Western State Psychiatric Hospi-
tal. It is one of the prerequisites
for admission to medical school. The
fee of $1.00 must be paid at the
treasurer’s oﬂice before the date
of the test. The receipt will be re-
quired as a card of admission to
the examination.

ternities. So best_.of,1uck,to_.you, '

 By HERMAN FELDMAN

    Rllmbzzngkeuzews  I

..E'riEIay,-April 21', 1944.

My judgment of Junior Miss has been. shaped by circumstances

which will~have no effect on the average theater-goer. Earlier in the

season I saw Janie and Kiss ‘and Tell, both -of whichwere attempts to
cash in on the popularity of Junior Miss. It was inevitable, therefore,

that my enjoyment would be lessoned at the performance of the original
adolescent-girl comedy. There were remarkable similarities in the struc-

tainty that Junior Miss makes
Janie look like the stinkeroo of the
season. If you have not seen either
Kiss and Tell or Janie, you cannot
fail to rhapsodize over Junior
Miss. The play has enough in-
trinsic value that even a knowl-
edge of the characters and the plot
will be‘ fatal detraction.

The dialogue by the brilliant
‘team of Chodorov and Fields cre-
ates an adequate stream of laughs.
The plot ‘moves’ at"a* steady pace
and never, except in the ﬁrst scene,
does the action lag _, for more than
a moment or two.’ The characters
-— fabricated stereotypes for the
most part. But these, stereotypes
are rather refreshing, neverthe-
less. Judy Graves,vplayed by Pa-
tricia Peardon is new, or was new
until the imitators got to »work’.
Fuffy Adams, played by Peggy
Romano, nearly steals the show.
(She is a fourteen year old who
says “Hell” and “Crap” and
worse.) The long suffering father
is played by Eddie Nugent. (I am
inclined» to think that he is the
most important. member of the
cast; much of the humor is
wrenched from his woes.) Hal
Conklin is charming as Uncle
Willis. '

Next week the sensational Chi-
cago play Good Night Ladies!
comes to the Nixon. This farce,
about sex of course, was the great-
est success in Chicago theatrical
history.

Now that the legitimate drayma
is out of the way the “corruption
of an art,” the moving picture, is
free to rear its sinister head. Last
Friday I noticed a volume entit-
led Twenty Best Screen Plays. The
editors of the collection make the
claim that the scripts of the best
sound movies are now apart of
our literature. Undoubtedly they
are correct. Art, if my interpreta-

than a medium for human expres-

ties. But he did iiot take the easy
way out. He stayed and served in
the only way he could—by treat-
ing the sick and wounded‘ of all
countries and religions.

If we at home think We are sacri-
ﬁcing too much_ by going without
that new pair of shoesor our tra-
ditional Easter ham, just let us

stop and think a moment. When‘

that small tattered band of men and
women marched, not rode in a car
propelled by. “bootleg” gas, from

Burma to India, they didn’t tell of ’

how much they were sacriﬁcing—
leaving, behind them homes, famil-
ies, friends, and more it had taken
years, to build up. Their only
thoughts were “God, I hope I can
get a chance to hit back at those
Japs.” They marched; we ride. They
starve; we eat. They died because
even the basic necessities were
lacking; we live in comparative
comfort.

Who has sacriﬁced? Not we. Ev-
en today, at this very minute, they
are at work saving lives. After
their historic march, they could
have rested and relaxed for the dur-
ation. That, however, is not the way
Dr. Seagrave and his staff worked.
As soon as they felt well enough to
work again, he (went to General
Stillwell and said: “We hope when
new action develops against the
Japs, you'll save the meanest, nasti-
est task of all for us!” The general
turned on him like a flash with a
real sparkle in his eye and said, “I
can certainly promise you that!”
And he kept his promise, for today
Dr. Seagrave is attached to the
Chinese 6th Army ﬁghting “some-
where in China.”

For','jhis work Dr. Seagrave re-
ceived" no medals or awards; his
work is not glamorous; but with-
out him and men like him their
would be no American Army. No,
his" work is not romantic — it is
merely indispensible. ~

By Kappa Ph1s
Officers for the coming year were
elected at a recent meeting of the

Xi Chapter of Kappa Phi, national
organization for Methodist college

’ women. The chapter is composed of

girls from both Pitt and Tech. Those
Pitt women elected to office Were:
vice president from Pitt, Edna Ha-
den, C; program chairman, Betty
Ryckman, C; chaplain, Marguirete
Ward, C; corresponding secretary,
Betty Haffly, C; social chairman,

Although it uses the Greek plan
of organization, Kappa Phi is not
aﬂiliated with the National Panhel-
lenic Council, and i-ts members may
be fraternity women as well.

‘At Plane Plant  

Shirley Whippo, who was chair-
man of the war activities “commit-
tee at Pitt last year, is now taking
an even bigger role in the war ef-
fort. She has joined the engineer-
ing section of the Curtiss - Wright
Company’s big plant in Columbus,
Ohio. ’

After completing a special ten-
m o n t h aeronautical engineering
cadet training course at Purdue
University, Shirley undertook the
job of checking and approving draft-
ings and designs in the Columbus
plant, before they are blueprinted.

At'Pitt, Shirley was in the School
of'Education and ﬁgured promin-
ently in school activities. She was a

Heinz Chapel Choir, and received
the Dean Amos Memorial Fund
Award for outstanding woman at
the end of her Sophomore year.

Red Cross Asks
Pitt Girls’ Help

Red Cross has requisitioned sur-
gical gauze for 104 million dress-
ings from U. S. Army medical sup-
ply depots and it is now being
shipped to chapters throughout‘ the
country for processing. The Pitts-
burgh chapter surgical dressings
workers have been asked to make
200 thousand ‘large dressings, 18 x
26 inches, within the next month,
and Mrs. Wallace DaSef, chairman
of the department, is asking for as
many volunteer workers as possible
to help_f_ill the quota on time.

Mrs. DaSef said: “This call is al-
so for the women of Pitt. Here is a
way that you can help the war ef-
fort by helping make these urgent-
ly needed dressings. To be eligible
as a helper, all you need is a large
white apron or uniform to cover
street clothes. Those interested
should report to either Horne’s sur-
gical dressing rooms which are open
from noon to four o’clock on Mon-
days, and from 9:30 to 3:30 o’clock
Tuesdays through Fridays; or the
East Liberty headquarters of the
Red Cross, 401 North Highland
avenue, which has hours from 9 to
3:30 Monday through Friday, and
on Monday and Wednesday eve-
nings from 7 to 9:30.

“It takes more than three million
dressings daily to provide stock
wherever United States’ troops are
in action. Our soldiers can’t receive
eﬁicient medical care without the
necessary supplies and these sup-
plies cannot be supplied without the
help of all. So ﬁnd yourself a white
apron, report to one of the two
workrooms and help the Red Cross
come through with the dressings
needed.”

Red Cross Needs Women

T-he Personnel Recruitment Com-
mittee of the American Red Cross‘
needs young women to serve as staff
assistants in clubs, clubmobiles and
recreation centers overseas. The
age limit is from 25 to 35, and ap-
plicants should be college graduates.
There are also some openings for
Red Cross Hospital staff aides for
Army and Navy hospitals in this
country and overseas. Information

THE SIDELINE COACH I

By LEN TANNENBAUM
sports editor

It’s Spring A gain
, With the 1944 Panther baseball season only three days
off, now might be an opportune time to consider the possibili-
ties of Coach Ralph Mitterling’s third war-time group of dia-
mond performers. They are certain of accomplishing their
primary objective—keeping the sport alive. Just to what ex-
tent they _will prolong its existence, however, is the matter
of immediate concern.
For one thing the Mitterling men will be called upon to
face, in the course of their abbreviated eight-game schedule,

R some of the nations most polished and well stocked schools,

who in addition to the incalculable edge in experience have

._ the additional advantage of a twenty-game schedule with

breathers tossed in along the way. Their rosters read like an
all-star collegiate aggregation, composed of players from coast
to coast, many of whom in addition to college participation
have played organized baseball, too.

_ The Panthers.themselves have not yet had a chance to
prove themselves. If the age old proverb, “A chain is only as
strong as its weakest link,” holds for this season’s- Panthers,
the skyscraper fans are in for another dissappointing season.
For the Mitterling men at this date appear to deﬁnitely have
too many weak spots. Their twirlers are untested in actual
battle and their power at the plate is as yet only a matter of
speculation. The inﬁeld appears to be Coach Mitterling’s great-

"- est salvation but it too is untried. A look through the records

will show that it was an average of ﬁve errors a game that
contributed in no small way toward making last year’s effort
a total flop.

-W What the Panther diamond representatives lack in exper-

‘ ience and ability, however, they more than atone for in ﬁght

and spirit. Come what may, though, Coach Mitterling’s war-
riors will be carrying on in the manner of all Panther athletic
squads, and although inthe role of underdog throughout, will
prove that Pitt, handicapped or not, can hold its own. A little

’ encouragement and support from the student body for a

change would go along way toward boosting the 1944 Panther
spin s.

‘lire You Kidding?

. Fortunately for most college baseball mentors they are
not confronted with the grave problems that are facing Great
Lakes Naval Training Station’s coach, Lieutenant Gordon S.
“Mickey” Cochrane. A Great Lakes press release reports that
{with the ﬁrstgame of the season less than three weeks away
‘the former Detroit great is faced with the problem of build-

.»ln'-,»aa£Juﬁ.' .: -...v»

. .

7ing a brand new baseball club, since all of last year’s team

have been sent out for sea duty and advanced base duty.
Johnny Mize will not be back in the clean-up spot and the out-

I ﬁeld of Joe Grace, Barney McCosky, and Glenn McQuillen is

gone.

, All that poor “Mickey" will have to work with is a pitch-
ing staff that would do proud to any major league club, an in-
ﬁeld in the same category, and a catching staff of the same
class. The outﬁeld situation is not quite as rosy with only two
men with any major league experience on hand!

Pitchers who have reported are Virgil Trucks of Detroit,

 “Schoolboy” Rowe, Junior Thompson, and Bill Brandt of the
Pirates. In addition there are a large number of promising 

minor league players. Behind the bat will be either Clyde Mc-
Cullough of the Cubs or Bill Baker of the Pirates. Johnny
McCarthy of last year’s Giants is at ﬁrst, Billy Herman at

second, Albie Glossup in the shortﬁeld, and Merril May is on ;
.the hot corner. ;

Who has to worry about putting a team like that to- :_
gether? All you have to do is give them a ﬁeld. “Mickey” must I

be very much worried about the opener, too, for it is against

, a stellar Western Michigan University team!

The Pitt News

By MAX SCHERB '

When Coach Ralph Mitterling’s
Panthers leave the ﬁeld this Mon-
day after the Juniata game, they
will have answered a multitude of
questions, all concerned with the
outlook of Pitt’s third wartime
diamond campaign. For the Pan-
thers at present loom as one big
question mark, there being noth-
ing outside of last year’s disap-
pointing record upon which to
judge their merits. Man for man,
they are a potentially powerful
team in some departments, while
noticeably lacking in others. Their
practice tilts have shown them to
be more or less of a hot and cold
squad, and woe to the team that
should happen on to them on one
of-their good days, which we sin-
cerely hope may occur often.

The pitching stall’ is the biggest
of a great number of question
marks. The only mound holdover
being “Big Jim” Reber, whose dent
school studies have been keeping
him from attending as many prac-

will undoubtedly be one of the
Panther starters. Rounding out
the stall’ are George Pierce, Jack
Citron, and Jim Davis.

Most encouraging of any of the
departments is the backstop posi-
tiop. Joe Kielb and Al Wettingale,
both veterans of past campaigns,
are back and Coach Mitterling has
shifted Jack Itzel, one of Clark
Shaughnessy’s gridiron stalwarts,
behind, the bat.

From all indications the inﬁeld
too should well. give Panther fans
cause for enthusiasm. At the key-
stone position is a left-handed new-
comer, John Lozar, who in addition

‘, ing, providing they can ﬁeld at

least seven men on the mushball

feit the game to the opposing team-

This year, the mushball campaign

ny Goodman, who is having trouble
with his booking agency, and Har-
ry James, who is leaving for the
service soon.
Even though bands are "break-
p ing up, new bands are forming.
Some of the exceptional new
bands are Benny Carter, Boyd
Raeburn, Georgie Auld, Jess Sta-
cy, and Frankie Carle. Artie
Shaw, recently discharged from
the service, may or may not form
a band. .

Lionel Hampton was in Pittsburgh
last week at the Stanley, and in
my opinion he ranks second only to
Duke. The band was terriﬁc in all
ways. Hampton has recorded four
sides for “Keynote” with his sex-
tet.——Don’t miss them.

This past week brought Charlie
Spivak, and although he played
good ballad numbers, it wasn’t the
’S'pivak of the past. The band had
no drive on the jump tunes and
wasn’t the least bit inspiring except
when Spivak took some of his beau-
tifully phrased solos. It was a let-
down after Hampton’.s really ter-
riﬁc band.

FLASH: Be sure to listen to the
Spotlight Band (broadcast on Sat-
urday night, May 6) when the Coca
Cola Company will broadcast from
the University of Pittsburgh at
Pitt’s Spring Festival. Ted FioRito’s

band will be in the spotlight.

Sweet and Low--down

Today let us look first at the record situation. There are only two
record companies that haven’t settled with the musician’s union as yet,
Victor and Columbia, but the other companies are pulling ahead of them
so fast that these two will have to settle in the ne-ar future. Decca  ‘
in front of the ﬁeld now and is cutting records as fast as they possibly
can. Two other comparatively new companies, Hit and Capitol, are also
coming along fast. People are buying more Commodore records, and it
is encouraging to see that jazz records are becoming more greatly ap-
preciated. Since band recordings have been resumed, better tunes are
on the market, and “Tin Pan Alley” is working full time.

The band situation is very indeﬁnite. Many of the leaders are in the
service, and the ones remaining are having trouble keeping their bands
together. Their chief troubles are transportation and hiring suitable
men. The work has never been better than it is now, but band leaders _4
‘are watching the new tax to see how it will aﬂ"ect business. The two 1at- '

est big outﬁts to break up are Ben-(tr
