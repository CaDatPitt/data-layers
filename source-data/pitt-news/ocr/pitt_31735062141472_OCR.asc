of the death ., of one of the ‘members
of the trombone section, a vacancy
has occprr-ed. This place -must be

sals will be missed. I In all probability
two new trombone players will. be

Some Reiifiniscences of Old  

w. U. P. Back in 1905.ays

, J. M.‘(“Red") Grier, Ex. Col. '08, of Avalon, sends a letter to the
Alumni Office which recalls some of the happenings at the University
(then W. U. P.) in.the'"days of 1905. His recollections of the “pep" ‘
meeting held before the'W. & J. game that year are very interesting
as they recall to the mindof the Alumni Secretary a similar gathering
in 1906 which was held, as .we recall, in the auditorium of the Alle- .
gheny High School. In those '-days the departments of the University
were so badly scattered throughout the city that a man in the Dental
or Medical Departments very seldom got "in touch with the fellow in
College and Engineering. .In fact, it was very easy for one to go
through four years of college and. notknow any'students at ‘W. U. P; .
other than those in’ his particular department. » _

.- The College and Engineering departments were located on Obser-
vatory Hill on the North Side. The Dental ‘School was at Pride and
Bluff streets, where the Pharmacy School is now located, and the

Medical School was at Brereton avenue, just above the Twenty-eighth
street yard of the Pennsylvania Railroad, adjacentto the Old West
Penn Hospital.» It -was quite an occasio whenthe students of all
departments got together for a ‘.‘pep" mee ing, and the W. '&. J. game
was always a signal for one of these gatherings.’ ‘
A THE BAND

_ Grier, in his article, refers to the Pitt Band. In those days the D.
band at the football game was usual-Ly furnished by ‘_‘Danny" Nirella,
the students "chipping in" ten cents each in order to pay him. On“ _
several occasions bands were organized by the students, and evi-
dently there was one in .1905, although it did not last. ‘The "present
Pitt band was organized through the efforts‘ of Dr. D. 1. Kirk, Med.
'16, and it.came into existence around‘ 1910. ‘ '

Reminiscences, such as those furnished by Mr. Grier, are _mighty
interestingto Pitt Readers and we quote his letter in fi.ill:

“Talking about old days at the"University on Perrysville avenue,
or better known as Observatory‘ Hill, reminds meof several old
timers that were used in 1905. (Fall.)' I wonder how many of the .
‘old grads"remember our assembling at old Kenyon Hall on the after-,
noon before the W. &. J. game of that year. A large number of boys
were present from all departments and we'we_re~taught to sing an '
Alma Mater song that ran like this: . ' 1'

. ALMA MATER

“Have you heard the old refrain?

*We will sing it once again, '

Singing for Western Pennsylvania

With our hearts so brave and true.
‘A We'will cheer the’Gold ‘and Blue

Cheering for Western Pennsylvania.

- Chorus: '
“Hail, Alma Mater, every son cheers thee now.
To thee, W. U. P., all foeman will bow.

Victorious forever thru colors shall be , V
And ever shall wave in victory. » _ ' l

 

“I don't remember who the other three of the quartet were, who
led our singing in the packed hall_, but I do know that ‘Red’ Copeland,
now of Jones & Laughlin Law Department, was one. . _

CHANCELLOR THERE

. “Chancellor McCormick ‘and other prominents made rip-roaring
speeches, and we practiced our old yells, particularly our Alle-ge-nee,
and also four or five songs of the popular variety, but worded to wish
all dire distress on our foemen. We then. went down to Exposition
Park and cheered the team. ’ ‘ - '

‘‘I wonder how many people remember the Pitt band in which I
played a' drum. ‘Our uniform consisted of light pearl grey egg-friar

' ‘lids’_ for which the.Athletic Association paid one dollar a piece.
“This, however, is enough of your time at present, but will write
you some time again about that band and the stuff we pulled in our
.. parades in order that we ’could make a showing.” ‘

ATHLETE AT lllll W; U. P.

A letter from Dr. J. Q. (“Quince”)
Banbury, Dent. ’08, of 609 Orpheum

Building, Wichita, Kans., in which he

orders a varsity letter pin, sort of
stirsup old memories with the.Alum-
ni Secretary. Dr. Banburylewas .a
great athlete at the University when
Pitt, then W. U. P., was young-in an_
athletic way. He won his letter in"
football in '05, '07, and "08, being cap-
tainof the '08 team. ‘He also won
his letter in track in ’,06,7.’07 and '08.

“Little Ban,” as he was called to
distinguish him fromrhis brother Dr.
V17. F. Banbury, "Dent. '07, known as
“Big Ban," was -one of the speediest
halfbacks that ever played football
at the University. His thrilling runs
were always a feature‘ of the ‘big

6 games‘ at. old Expo Park’ and there

was no telling when he was liable to
get loose for one-of them.

In track “Little Ban" was just as
«great astar and his individual work
was responsible for some great victo-
ries. The secretaryrecalls onein a
dual meet with Carnegie Tech.
was held at Friendship Park, where
the West Penn Hospital isnow lo-
cated; This was around "08. Ban-
bury, who was good-in the hurdles,
sprints and broad jump had already
competed. in several trial heats and
ﬁnals of these events, and he was
pretty well worn out when the broad
jump came around. 1 

The result of the meet hinged on
whether Pitt or Tech, would" take first
place in the broad jlump. Lon Grif-
ﬁth,-a bigfellow from Tech had “Lit-
tle «Ban"‘ beatenCuntil' the very last
leap, when, displaying the grit and
speed which made him such. a won-
derful athlete, “Little Ban" pulled off
a winning jump, beating Griffith by
an inch. - _ ' _

A good ‘afternoon's work for “Lit-

_,_tle' Ban" on the track was trial and
‘ ﬁnal heats of the 100, ditto of '-the

220 dash,‘ ditto of the low hurdles, the
broad jump and, possibly a ﬂing at
‘one of the other events. Track ath-
letes were rather! scarce in those
days, and the burden usually fell on
a few stars.

Dr. Banbury is doing well with his
dental practice in Kansas. He has
also found time to do ‘a little coach-
ing on the sidefwith the local high
school teams of that section. Vvhen
Dr. George W. McLaren was out in
Kansas as coach of the Kansas State
Normal College, Emporia, Kansas, he
advised the writer that he frequently
got in -touch with “Little Ban.”

PLAN EIIRIIPEAN Tllllli

S. S. Fitz-Randolph of the Modern
Language Department is planning to
conduct a tour to Europe during the
summer vacation. The nature of- the
trip will be determined by those tak-
ing it. In general the tour will com-
prise an extended visit to France,
Germany, Italy, or England with the
purpose of studying the language, the
art, and the inhabitants of the coun-
try visited.‘

The length of the trip will vary
from thirty-four days to twelve
weeks. The expenses Involved will
depend upon the special tour chosen.

the prices rangingfrom seven hun-
dred dollars to ﬁfteen hundred dol-
lars. All students interested are
asked to see Professor Fitz-Randolph
in Room 107 Alumni Hall, where any
literature or information on the pro-
posed tours may be secured.

llEl’AllTlIlENT HE_AIrSPfAKS:

Prof. H. D. Fish,lhe‘ad of the De.
partment of Zoology of the Univer-
sity spoke at Carnegie Museum Lec-

 

 

.ture Hall, Thursday, February 15, at

8:15 p. in. “My Pets, and Why I Call
Them Mine.” '

Prof. Fish said that the same es-
thetic sense inspires both the artist
and the naturalist. “Painters and
sculptors,” he said, “express their
feelings by creating material inter-
pretations of concepts of beauty.
Botanists and Zoologists express
their feelings by gaining the most in-
timate knowledge of plants and ani-
mals. Both are prompted by an in-
ate love of nature.”

The basket ball team will engage

Gymnasium where the ﬂoor team
representing West Virginia Wesleyan
University will be met-. This game
will be the last-home contest or the

tonight Pitt will play a return. game
with Washington and Jefferson in
Little Washington, and a week from

EVENINGESCVHOOL
‘ HOLDS SMOKER

 

(Continued From Page One)
Taylor and “Jim” Parkhill, could
make some of Ziegﬁel'(i’s best work
for their places.

“Doc” -Curry, the seemingly bone-
less wonder of the century, and “Art”
McLaughlin, the ventriloquist without
equal, provoked much mirth with
their “Spring Dance as It Should Be

Sprung,” their acrobatic feats of
strength and skill, and witty side-
play. .

“Art” James ‘and Zareh Yardum as
“Mr. Shallegher and Mr. Ghean, etc.”
brought forth gales of laughter and
insistent applause with their rapid-
ﬁre dialogues and their clever use of
the “Gallagher and “Shean” song in
connection with various members of
the faculty, the band, the football
team and others.

John Arnold and Bill Taylor were
very much put out that the time al-
lotted them would not permit of their
playing all the instruments which the
scope of their ability embraced.

Alex Colledge, the multitudinous
“blushing bride,” about whose health
“Mal” Cherry was so concerned, pre-
sented a problematical ‘appearance un-
til his; beaming face shown forth.
This pairiwas responsible for a num-
ber of new and snappy bits of dia-
logue.

The ﬁrst part of the program was
completed by a ﬁgurative interpreta-
tion by “Zira” in the person of
“Junie" Roberts ‘after which the as-
sembled multitude betook themselves
to the eats.

The program was resume_d after a
short intermission the second part
being taken up by “The-Annual En-
tertainment of the Seedy Hollow
Skule.” This was in two scenes, the
ﬁrst, the schoolroom in the morning,
and the second, the schoolroom on
the night of the entertainment.

“Art” James, as the teacher proved
himself quite capable ;' he was solici-
tons for the well-being of his scholars
and his casual remarks put in a. droll
and natural way were entirely in
keeping with his "part.

John Arnold was just “adorable” as
“Susie Swallow” and his ﬂaxen curls

and rufﬂes made him a vision of love- '

liness. His_ delicate voice was well
suited to his recitation “Spring Has
Came.”

“Bill’ Roberts as “Percival Sun-
shine” was the personiﬁcation of a
Fauntleroy and the acme of the per-
fectly bred and courteous child,
though at times the teacher found it
necessary to "curb his desires. 'His
’celo selection was well rendered and
appreciated as indicated by the ap-'
plause. . '-

“Hiram Dolittle,” the lad‘ of invol-
untary and impetuous actions was
well taken bv “Russ” Hamilton. His
recitation implied his lack of free-
dom to accomplish great things,
though he seemed c'apa.ble in two in-
stances. May he have a speedy recov-
ery and the" accompanying peace of
mind. ‘

The country school boy of the ﬁd-
gety, rough and ready type, who feels
his importance on such an occasion
and is anxious that his "friends may
see him, was well handled by “Art”
McLaughlin as “Bert Blurt.”

Demure “Gladys Canby,” the
“Vamp” of the school room and Hi-
ram Doolittle’s best girl was nor-
trayed’ by “Junie” Roberts in a highly
commendable manner.

The last. but by no means least,
of the scholars was “Antonio Gui-
seppe Pasquale Garbage Luca Gar-
ter,” generally recognized as Zareh
Yardum» and his revelations as to the
early acts of “Georgie da Wash” pre-
sented the “Father of Our Country”
in a new and startling light. His fur-
ther selections on the mandolin were

enthusiastically received ‘and his
work was well applauded. .-

BASKET BAIL BANIIIIET

Herbert McCracken and George
Carson have been delegated to arouse
alumni interest in the basket ball
banquet to be given under the direc-
tion of the University Y. M. C. A.,
.March 13. Many of the guests at
the banquet last year were alumni
and the committee .hopes for a. larger
representation at this year’s banquet.
A special effort‘ is being made to
have as many former Pitt basket

The general‘ banquet committee,
made up of the social and Open
Forum Committees, has been unable
as yet to secure a deﬁnite place in
which to hold the banquet, but ne-
gotiations now pending promise to
clear up the matter by n-ext week.
Last year, the banquet was held: in
the church ‘at Thackary street and
Fifth avenue. As the church proved
too small, efforts are being mad-e to
hold this year’s banquet in a larger
room. ‘

This will be the second annual

basket ball banquet under the direc-
tion of the Y. M. C. A.
- ‘The captain of next year’s basket
ball team will be elected at this ban-
quet as is the football captain at
the football banquet. The basket
ballbanquet will be carried out on
lines similarqto those of the football
-banquet, with as many additional fea-
tures as is possible.

The Y. M. NC. A. reels that it is
‘doing a real service to both the
-basket ball team and the school by
holding this public manifestation 01
their appreciation for the Work of
a, team which has a strenuous season
and but little reward to compare with
that of some of the other teams.

up their tenth straight victory of this
season on its home court at the ex-
pense of the Panther quintet. _ The
ﬁnal» score was 38 to 11 and‘ was the
worst beating handed a. Pitt_ basket
ball team for a longtime. .The
State guards held the Pitt forwards
to three ﬁeld goals; while their own
forwards dropped 15 through the
hoop's from every V possible . position
of the court. Pitt managed to cage
only two goals from the ﬁeld in. the
ﬁrst half while their "rivals counted.
for eight. 9 The Nittany Lions took
the lead‘ at the start with Koehler’s
goal from the side and the half end-
ed with Pitt ‘on the short end ofia
20.,to 8 score. , ~

The second half was even "less en-A

The Pitt swimmers split even on
their. easterninvasion, defeating Le-
high 41-30, and being nosed out by
Army 36-35. Lehigh was met at Beth-
leliem on Friday night; and‘ the S01-
diers were met at*West,P_oint on Sat-
urday evening. The P-sw}imm'ii_1g of
Kistler, Clark, Kern and Steele who
won ﬁrst places in both tmeets fea-
tured the trip. ' ' V ’
The Panthers won the Lehigh meet
in handy fashion by taking 5 ﬁrstsv
and enough second and third places;
to have an 11 point advantage atithe
endof the -meet. The best event of
the night was the 50-yard. dash in
whichischaffer of Leh-igh, and Steele

to the ﬁni-sh when Steele spurted
ahead and won the race.. Corr, of
Pitt, nosed out Schaffer for" second
place bya beautiful burst of speed.
Captain John ‘Clark showed’ good
form in the plunge by doing 68 feet
to capture the event. Kistler won the
.back str‘oke‘with Steele a good sec-
ond. , -“Pat” Corr won the 100-yard
‘free’ style by again nosing out Slcl1af-
fer. Lacy took third in this event.
Le-‘high showed to advantage in the
200-yard‘ relay by winning in the fast
-timeiof‘ 1 minute. 49 4-5 seconds. ~
‘ Inthe hardest fought meet held in
the West Pointtank hi this season,
Army nosed out Pitt by one point.
The meet was not decided until the
last event, the 640 feet relay, which
the Soldiers won only by inches. The
end was similar to the Naval Acad-
emy meet when the Panthers lost the
‘last race and the meet by inches.
At the ‘start of the ﬁnal event the
Panthers had a comfortable lead, the
score then .re'ading 35-28 in ‘Pitt’s fa-
vor. Wonderful work by Dearmond,
who swam _well in other events, won
the race for the Cadets when-l1e_ led

The Freshman basket "ball team
won‘ two games and lost one last
week. "On last Tuesday evening
they defeated the ‘strong 'W'ilkinsburg
High School team at Trees Gymna-
sium, 37 to. 20, in the preliminary
game to the W. & J. game. 'Frev
.quent- penalties on both sides kept
the game from being as fast--as it
might have been. Through the ﬁne
work of the Panther’s big center,
_Cha_se, the Panther Cubs were able
to jump into the lead at the start.
He scored" four -baskets before any-
one else dropped the bal-l through
the ringt, Thoreson broke loose in
the last quarter and ran the score u;.‘-.
For Wilkinsburg, Duvall was the
high scorer. Love of Will<insbuI'g
also played agood’ game at guard.
'On Friday night the Yearlings
journeyed to Bellefonte to play a
return engagement with the Academy
team. Bellefonte has been defeated
three times this season and the
Panther Cuibs turned the trick twice.
Sometime ago they defeated Belle-
fonte at -Trees Gymnasium, 33 to 30,
in an extra period .ga.mc. On Friday
night the Freshmen had a re-al en-
gagement on their hands. ' Bellefonte
started off like a whirl wind and
never let -up the whole first half and
, as a result the Yearlings were trail-
ing 15 to 14 when the half ended.
When the second half istarted Belle-
fonte increased their lead to three
“points by a long ﬁeld goal. Within
ﬁve minutes they had made up their
three point disadvantage and had. a
comfortable margin to work on.
Hawkins found himself in this _half

goals. !Captain Parsons playing
‘guard, allowed his man only one ﬁeld
goal. Captain Ash of Bele-fonte,
, played a good game. A

- «Saturday night the Freshmen went
J90 State College and played the
Penn ‘State Freshman team. Earlier
in the season the Panther Cubs de-
feated the Nittany Lions. at Pitts-
burgh, but they could not turn the
trick again, losing 26 to 115. Rich-
man was the high score-r for State
while Chase played a good game at
center for Pitt.- Tome-rrow night the
Freshmen play Bellevue High School
in the preliminary game to the W'est
Virginia. Wesleyan-Varsity game.

A In the first half, Byers bagged”',a..'.

colleague, Carr added another. ‘Lev-"'
inson made most of the ’_foullgoa1s_"_:
in the initial half, while his .op‘p’oi,
nent foul shooter, Cecil Conn, made
a miserable" showing. The half ﬁn} 
ished with ‘Pitt on the long end by la.
big margin, 13 to 7, ‘brought about? -
by the inconsistent foul shooting’ of]
C. Conn. ' 1 1  

At the start of the second -stanza...”
the same story was to be told by-C. ?:i,.-
'Conn at the fOllil line, and the Presfi-,_7-71

of»:"oul shooting, but after sinkinglf

style‘ that Conn had displayed previ-
ously, -Cecil was again injected in-
to the fray, and placed some long‘ 1,
shots from the middle of the‘ ﬂoor
which soon had the Little Washing-, ',
ton lads in the ra-ce ‘again, when the‘ 
scoreboard told the tale of 18 to S15-.711
At this point of the game, Herb" 
Saunders, the stellar guard for the 
visitors, took a reces period from y'‘:;:
guarding Lloyd Jordan, and this short ..
vacation put Pitt into a wonderful ‘5.
lead which the latter held until the 6 it
ﬁnish of the contest. Near the end
of the game‘, Kemp Conn of the visi- . K
tors, was knocked‘ out by running
into his team mate, Lyle. 

The game was a very close guard-V
ing affair, and Saunders and Kemp .
:Conn showed their wares in a fine 
manner with their guarding of they‘
Pitt forwards. The Panthers guards. ‘
may also receive some commendation . J.
for their splendid work at defense,
and eat all times the VI, & J. ‘men
were forced. to make long shots, sel-__ it
