  As Center
For Morale

Pitt, continuing its part in
the war effort, has been select-
ed as one of the eight key cen-
ters of War Information and
Training in Pennsylvania.

These key centers have been es-

tablished by the Federal Security
‘ agency, Office of Education, Civil-

ian Morale service, to supply their

surrounding t e r r i t o r i e s with

speakers, discussion leaders, and
“~ bands, in order to build and main-
s tain high morale. '

In charge of the center at Pitt
is Dr. John Oliver, head of the De-
partment of History. Dr. A. L.
Robinson, associate professor of
Chemistry is in charge of receiving
material for the War Information
library.

Dr. Oliver, who represented Pitt
at the state meeting of directors
of key centers at Harrisburg, last
‘week, states that Pitt has pro-
gressed considerably in comparison
with reports from the other key
centers.

’ In the belief that an awakened
<morale will mean everything in a
crisis, the members of the confer-
ence attempted to point out ways
in which high moral may be ob-
tained.

Dr. S. K. Stevens, of Pennsyl-
vania Historical Commission, em-
phasized the value in stressing
state and local history. Others
stressed the value of regular town
meetings instead of unimpressive
printed material.

Candidates for degrees in the
Graduate School and the School of
Education in August must make
application for graduation in the
officers of their deans not later
than July 6. _,

Assistant Registrar.

Fully trained college men are in-
dispensible to the nation in time
of war as well as in peace, the
army and navy have decided and
as a result college men have been
given every opportunity to receive
their degrees prior to entering the
armed forces.

The latest release issued jointly
by the war and navy departments
grants almost every college man
who would be eligible for the draft
the chance to ﬁnish his college
years by joining the Army Enlisted
Reserve Corps. ,

Professors Do Overtime

As Estimate Falls Short

Two—hundred andﬁfteen men in the 18-to—20 age group
were registered by 4 o’clock with many still to come on the

Fifth R-Day last Tuesday.

 Local draft board number four advised the University
that no more than 150 men would register in this district or
25 per cent of the previous 600 registration ﬁgure. P

In accordance with these

instructions J. G. Quick, Uni-

versity registrar, asked nine faculty members to assist him in

Rumanian Archaeologists Design New,
University Nationality Classroom  

By LOIS ROWBOTTOM

The Rumanian room, most re-
cently started nationality room, is
a room with a history.

It was designed originally by
Professor Chica-Budesti, an archi-
tect in Bucharest, best known for
his archaeological studies of an-
cient Rumanian churches and
monasteries.

Later when the Rumanian Pav-
ilion and Rumanian home at the
World's Fair in New York were
dismantled, Pitt was given ﬁrst
choice of the art objects and the
marble and alabaster of which the
pavilion was built. '

This gift necessitated modiﬁca-
tions in the original plan; modifi-
cations which were made with skill
and strict adherence to Rumanian
style by A. A. Klimcheck, Uni-
versity architect.

And the Rumanian Room will be
a beautiful room.

One of the most decorative fea-
“tures of the room will be the
’ lemosiacwhieh will stretch 

 “em other     T

mosiac depicts Constantin Bran-
coveanu, Prince of Wallaichia, who
refused to recant his Christian
faith, even at the cost of the lives
of his nine children.

The windows in the room will be
romanesque. The four large ones
will form an alcove, shut off from
the main part of the room by a
plaster archway and wrought iron
gate. Blue silk draperies embroid-
ered with silver and gold threads,
which hung in the banquet hall at
the World Fair pavilion, will hang
at these windows.

This alcove will be like a shrine.
It will hold a collection of ﬁfteenth
and sixteenth century icons which
were sent to the World's Fair but
not exhibited.

Furniture in the room will be of
dark oak with characteristic Ru-
manian carvings. The professor's
table and chair are originals from
the World's Fair. The student
chairs will have carved backs from
the restaurant chairs used at the

   

And the Rumanian Room will be
impressive.
Even if the colorful mosiac, the

striking windows, the unique ﬂoor,
and the typical Rumanian furni-
ture fail to impress you, there will
be an inscription over the massive
doorway which cannot be read
without some thought of the kind
of people that made this room
possible.

The inscription Wlll read, “The
Rumanian is unto the mighty rocks
which amidst the waves of the
stormy and haughty sea forever
unmoved remain.

Penn State Coach

Teaches Session Here

John D. Lawther, professor in
physical education and basketball
coach at Pennsylvania State Col-
lege, is teaching three courses dur-
ing the summer session at the Uni-
versity.

the registration. They, were to
work in three shifts. These three
men would have been sufficient to
meet the needs of the estimated
number of registrants.

However, the number of students
that reported at the close of each
class period was so great that it
taxed the ability of the registrars
to keep up with their work, Mr.
Quick said. In addition to this, the
supply of registration forms
threatened to give out. Mr. Quick
made two calls for more forms.
When the supply diminished to 20,
50 more registration forms were
sent by the local draft board.

The situation was relieved when
the local draft board informed the
University unit that registrars at
the Bcllefield school were not busy.
At various periods during the
peak hours, students were asked to
go to the Belleﬁeld school head-
quarters.

Mr. Quick stated that the entire
staff was kept busy at maximum
speed from 7:30 to 4 o'clock.

Freshmen, whether they have
pledged or not, may take residence
in fraternity houses beginning
Monday, July 13.

There will be no silence period.

Reserve 

Unlike the other special reserves

;. .:

V such as the ROTC, the naval re-

serve, and the marine reserve,
which have high standards of
physical requirements and re-
quired subjects, the enlisted re-
serve presents nearly the I same

qualiﬁcations that must be met by '

a draftee.

Under the plan, seniors, juniors, 3 or

sophomores, and freshmen can en-
list in the reserve under certain
quotas for each class and remain
fairly certain of completing their
schooling. As yet the deﬁnite
quotas have not been assigned to
each class.

Quotas will be. ﬁlled by those
students who are "best ﬁtted,
scholastically. Physical examina-
tion, it is understood, will be less
strict than any given for the other
reserves.

In the University, the ROTC has »_ S

preference in choosing students for *
the corps over both the naval re-
serve and the enlisted reserve.
Each student who enrolls in the
reserve does so with the following
reservation: namely, that if for
any reason he must leave school
he will be automatically inducted
into the army as an enlisted man
and that ifhe fails to maintain a
scholastic record which shows that
he is interested in the reserve he
will be inducted. Under the exist-
ing provisions, the secretary of
war may, in case the necessity of

\. war demands, call to active duty

members of the enlisted reserve at

any time.

. Procedure for the enlistment of
students at the University has
not as yet been permanently estab-
lished. Full particulars concerning
the quotas for the classes, required
scholastic standards, place of en-
listment, and other details will be
printed’ in Tuesday's Pitt News.

Rushing To Begin
Monday Morningx

Pitt's fraternities have already
started rushing upperclassmerr.
They will begin the rushing of new
freshmen Monday. .

In an effort to eliminate th
formality and expense of a regular

rushing program and to give V"

upperclass transfers the oppor-
tunity to be pledged quickly, fra-

ternity olllcers this week made

recommendations for s e v e r a l
changes in fraternity rushing rules

for the summer.

Here are the revised rules ac-
cepted by the Men’s Fraternities
committee:

There will be no formal rushing
period. An informal period will
begin Monday, July 6, at 8:30
a. m. Before that time, no new
freshmen may be contacted.

This rule does not apply to up-
perclassmen or transfers, who may
move immediately into fraternity
houses, and may immediately be
pledged by submitting bids through
the office of the dean of men.

Beginning 8:30 a. m., Monday,
fraternities may entertain new
freshmen as they wish. However
no freshman may be the guest of
the fraternity or a fraternity
member over night. Furthermore,
no musicians may be employed for
rushing events. Dancing shall be
to recorded music only.

Fraternities may submit bids to
the office of the dean of men any
time. beginning Tuesday, July .7.

Builds A Cathedral

In the ‘middle ofﬁ the nineteenth
century, German composer Richard

Music to Die Valkyrie. In the
middle of_I_ the nineteenth century
the University ‘suffered one ﬁre,

was rebuilt, again burned down.

Thus began the strange relation-
ship of Wagner’s “Valkyrie” to
the University of Pittsburgh, a
relationship which reached an
amazing culmination in a Philadel-
phia drawing room almost 100
years later.

It came inthe middle 1920’s, at
the time when Chancellor John
Bowman first thought about build-
ing the Cathedral. Radical was
the Chancellor’s plan to depart
from the accepted Oxfordian uni-
versity layo,_ut—-—many low-storied
ivy covered buildings, spread out
over a multi-acred tract of .ground.

Unconventional too was idea to‘ A

build upward-——to construct a sky-

' scraper as a school inrthe heart of
.a city. Opposition to the plan ran

high-citizens committees of Oak-
land residents formed to ﬁght the
idea, the town’s civic and indus-
trial lead.ers hesitatedto go along
with Dr. Bowman and his Ca-
thedral. ‘

Chief drawback, though, lay in
getting plans and sketches for the
building. Dr. Bowman knew what
he thought the Cathedral ought to

' look like~——no one else did. Dr.
Bowman sent out speciﬁcations to 

dozens of architects all over
America—-he -got back plans for
apartment houses, for oﬂice’ build-

ings, for everything except a,

Cathedral of Learning.

Finally Dr. Bowman went to the
Philadelphia home of architect
George Klauder, to supervise per-
sonally the drawing of rough plans
for the Cathedral. After hours of
drawing and erasing and tearing
up sketches and beginning again+-
Dr. Bowman was ready to give up
trying to get Klauder to under-
stand what he .wanted.

The two men quit talking about

.architecture and buttresses ‘and

foundations. Conversation turned

transfer to another participating institution.

(2) Students not taking advanced ROTC

they would normally graduate, except as
recommended by the institutional authorities
subject to the approval of the War Department.

(3) Students who fail to meet the prescribed
level in the qualifying examination as provided
in 5 b or who are deemed by the Army not to
have shown the necessary qualiﬁcations to be-
come probable oiﬁcer material.

“b. Students coming under" the provisions of
paragraph 10 a (1), (2), and (3), above, will be
reported to the Corps Area commander by the
school. authorities and will be ordered to active
duty in an enlisted status provided they have no
valid reason for deferment. These students will
have an equal opportunity for competing for a

number of college students possessing superior
qualiﬁcations, such students to remain for the

time being in an inactive status in order to con- 1

tinue their education. .
“3. The Army and Navy alike appreciate the
spirit of patriotism and self—sacriﬁce which has

led an increasing number of young men to fore- »

go, in whole or in part, a college education i_n

order to be immediately available to the armed 3
A forces -throughenlistment. The Army and Navy
recognize, however, that it is imperative to the j ‘

success of the war effort that there continue to
flow not merely into industry but also into the
armed forces numbers of men having the requi-
site educational background for rapid assimi-
lation into certain increasingly important and
increasingly technical ﬁelds of industrial and
military service.

“5. The country can no longer afford to have
young men proceed with their education, at a
moderate tempo. Extracurricular activities not
superﬁcially directed toward physical or mental
preparation for participation in the war effort
can no longer be encouraged. In war time,
recreation in college life must be limited to that
necessary for a healthy and well-rounded exis-

tence. In other words, the colleges in war time -

must be places of intensive effort.and accom-
plishment. For those colleges which are pre-

pared to proceed. with education7 along these \
lines, and for those young men who ‘are pre- '

pared to enter or remain in college with these
purposes and who have the qualities of mind
and character to carry them out, the Army and

Navy urgethe continuancei of college education.”
The Army and Navy will enlist a siibstantiai‘;

number of such men in the appropriate Enlisted

reserve Corps, and under present conditions ' ’

will,1eave themon an inactive status to con- ’
tinue their education, subject to immediate call,“
of the Secretary of War or the Secretary of the 5‘

Navy if for any reason this should thereafteir
be deemed necessary. Appropriate examina-
tions will be given in the second year, and any
men who do not meet the required educational
standard, or who otherwise are not deemed to
be carrying on their education with promise of
developing capacities of leadership will be
called to active duty at once.

“6. Men who accept the opportunity of enlist-
ment in the Army or Navy Reserve and who
conscientiously devote their efforts in college in
the manner indicated and those teachers in the
colleges who are necessary for the education of
these men may feel assured that they are doing
the job their country wants them to do and are
performing their full duty, in the war effort.
