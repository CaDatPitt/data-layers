' Two Pitt deans submitted their resigna-

fourth deans to resign or retire since J.

ignation in April. .  . h ‘ ' 4

Mary Briscoe, dean of the College of
Arts and Sciences, and Mary Lou Soffa,
dean of graduate studies of the Faculty of

effective summer of 1996. A’ ' 1 '-

The other two deans to resign since the

of the medical school. 1'

“The fact that you’re having a turnover
in deans doesn’t signify anything nega-

. tive,” said Ken Service, director of com- ~

munications. “The resignations have all
been for differentreasons.” '
Zoffer had indicated earlier that he was
thinking of retiring, and Bernier decided
to leave Pitt to take the position of dean of

‘medicine and vice president for academic

affairs at the University of Texas Medical

‘Branch.

Provost James Maher said that Briscoe
and Soffa based their decisions to resign
on the desire to return to teaching and

research, according to a campus update

issued by the Office of the Provost. n
Service said this isn’t the first time that
the deans at Pitt have had such a great

turnover. In 1986-87, nine deans were-*

appointed.

“Some of these things tend to goin
cycles,” he said. .

A Pitt faculty member since 1972,

Briscoe served as director of the Women’s 1

Studies Program and chair of the English
Department prior to becoming dean.

CAS is the largest single unit in the uni.-
versity. Most undergraduates have CAS

"We had lots of input, both
positive and negative, from all
the Student organizations. —We
kept the parts of the plan
which were deemed the most
important — mainly the flexi-
bility — and changed what we

had to to meet ‘the mandate to_
,_ break even.”

Despite all the complaints
voiced by students on being
forced to dump'BLOCKs at

the end of last semester in.

order to avoid losing money,
at a Food Service Committee
meeting in mid-March, the
consensus of students spoke
loud and clear: Make changes,

-. but keep the plan.

Sallade—Farina said she went
into the meeting with an
entirely new proposal for a
meal plan, but the student
response caused her to re-
work the BLOCK system in a
way that would meet student
needs as well as cover
Marriott’s financial loss.

After researching the eating

habits of college students both“

nationally and here at Pitt,
Sallade—Farina found that the
average student eats only
seven to 10 meals per week’ on
campus. At Pitt, most students
eat Monday through Thursday
lunch and dinner, Friday lunch

and Sunday dinner.
“Last year the number of _

unused meals at the end of the
semester fostered’ a BLOCK-
dumping frenzy which finan-

cially destroyed the program,
which had been priced to have
a lower percentage of
BLOCKS used,” she said.

“This year we_anticipate
100 percent of the BLOCKS
will be used by students, and
have priced the program to
break even at the participation
level.”

The new system breaks

down as follows: 135
BLOCKS for’ $750, 155
BLOCKS for $850, 180
.BLOCKs for $925, 195

BLOCKS for $975.

Each BLOCK will cost
$5.50, but students who
choose to eat outside cafete-
rias, in retail locations like
Eddie’s, will only receive
$4.50 worth of food.

Some Students, including
Andrew Roeth, find that to be
ridiculous.

“I’d think it would make
sense to charge more when
you get all—you-can-eat,”*says
Roeth. “It doesn’t make sense
to get less food for more
money when you go to
_Eddie’s.”

Members of the Resident
Student Association also
voiced complaints about the
price hike.

RSA President Andy Miller
told The Pitt News at the end
of last term that he felt
Marriott was using resident
students "as a safety net.” He
said the only fair plan would
be the option of having-all

choice dollars.

In response to Miller’s sug-
gestion of an all-choice dol-
lars option, Sallade—Farina
said that during the summer
that option is available but
that students complain that
they miss the cafeterias.

“Over 30 percent of the stu-
dents we hear from want the
nutritionally—balanced meals
and all—you-can-eat option the
cafeteria provides. There is
currently no option in
Oakland to replace the variety
and quantity of food the cafe-
teria offers the students,” she
said. .

Student Government Board
members were among those
who favored keeping’ the plan
with a few changes to be
made.

Board member John
Callahan asked students and
Marriott to give the BLOCK
Meal Plan “another shot” at
the meeting in March, ensur-
ing “all the bugs could be

_ worked out.”

The BLOCK Plan was orig-
inally introduced to meet the
needs of the student body, said
Sallade—Farina. It was devel-
oped through both oral and
written surveys given to stu-
dents. ‘

Under the pre-BLOCK plan,
if you didn’t show up for
breakfast you lost the opportu-
nity to eat breakfast; if you

with a dinner, there were no pro-
visions made for youto obtain
that meal at a different time. If
you went home for the weekend,
or were an athlete who travelled,

you lost all the meals you missed. 9

Under the old plan students lost
over 40 percent of the meals they
purchased. The price for a meal
eaten in 1993 was well over $5.00
for that reason, according to Food
Services.

The BLOCK system allows stu-
dents to use their BLOCKS any-
time, and they will not lose them
until the end of the semester.
Students can now also eat meals
from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.

Students also complained about
the lack of variety in food choic-
es. With the BLOCK system
came Eddie’s, and along with the
new retail location came selec-
tion. Students can choose from
Baskin Robbins, Burger King and

Wholey’s to name a few.

The BLOCK system also per-
mits students to bring food back
to their rooms and to treat a friend
to a meal, two options that were
not available without BLOCKS.

Sallade-Farinaadvises all stu-
dents: “Exercise your right to an
all-you-can—eat meal in the cafete-
ria, particularly for lunch and din-
ner, and use the retail operations
as they were intended — as a
change of pace.”

you can do things more effec-
tively, you take it,” he said.
Service said the changing
environment has given Pitt
that opportunity.

The committee members
will be appointed and elected
within the next two months,
and the committee recommen-
dations are expected by the
end of the current academic
year

Another review committee
came to Pitt last month. J.W.
Connolly, the chair of the
board of trustees, appointed
an expert on transformational
leadership to lead a team that
will. among other areas, make
suggestions about appropriate
characteristics for the next
chancellor and improving
public relations.

But, according to two rank-
ings in national publications,
Pitt’s image doesn’t seem to
be hurting much. It was
ranked 93rd in Money maga-
zine’s listing of the top 100
schools in terms of best buys
for the money. Pitt ranked
above both Columbia and
Northwestern.

Pitt also ranked in the top
50 schools in its -category in

U.S. News and World Report. ’

But the committee will
review more than just Pitt’s
image.

“The committee is looking
at all aspects of the universi-
ty,” Service said. Although
there is already internal
review and analysis, “it
always helps to get an‘ objec-
tive outside opinion.”

“The other issue is that even
though we are doing things
well in a lot of areas, there’s
always an opportunity to do
things better.”

intrigued her.

“I like a challenge, and I
know that it’s going to be a
lot of hard work,” she said.
“I was very active in high
school, and I feel like I’m

not doing anything in col-

lege.”

According to Lauren
Farrell, internal vice‘presi—
dent, rush is the best way for
these women to interact.

“Rush is a great way for
these girls to meet people
and see who they feel com-
fortable with,” she said.
“Although they only choose
one house in the end, it’s a
great opportunity for them to
meet everyone.”

The rush process is much
more complex for sororities
because it is strictly bounded
by certain guidelines format-
ted by the Panhellenic
Association. The fraternities
follow the guidelines of the
Interfraternity Council,
which are less formal and
more relaxed.

“The girls have to limit
their choices from 12 [down]
to two ‘houses, but the guys
get to look at the houses that

they are only interested in.” she said.

This may sound like a drawback
because the process is so time-con-
suming. However, Farrell said that it
actually enables the girls to make a
much more thorough decision.

“By the time they get down to their
last few houses, they have a good
sense of where they belong,” she
said. -

, Cyrus Zolghadri, vice president for
member recruitment, said that there
are differences but there are also sim-
ilarities as well. He said that it is
much more difficult for the male
rushees to closely associate with all
of the fraternities, because there are

24 fraternities and only 12 sororities
on campus.

According to Zolghadri, previous
surveys revealed that these rushees
actually prefer only rushing the hous-
es that they choose.

“The surveys that were done last
year showed that the majority of peo-
ple that rushed only looked at an
average of three houses,” he said.
“It’s more convenient for both parties
[rushees and fraternity members] to
meet and greet people from prospec-

. tive houses.”

However, Zolghadri said that men
and women can share similar benefits
if they choose to join the Greek sys-
tem. “It’s a period when both men

and women can find their niche on
campus,” he said. “It can be their
home away from home.”

Zolghadri said that the Greek sys-
tem is not just a social program.
“Every chapter has a special bond
that links its members together,” he
said. “It’s a_group of men working
together, striving together, in order to
reach a common goal — that’s what
brotherhood is.”

One of the rushees who wants to be
part of that unity is Steve Schaar, a

freshman from Baltimore. “You get

the chance to share life-long bonds of
brotherhood,” he said.

Schaar said he is leaning toward
joining Sigma Chi. “They seem to

have a good head on their shoulders
and a good moral up-standing,” he
said.

Tom Weir, a freshman from
Levittown, said that he also hopes to
build lasting friendships. ‘‘I want to

future job references,” he said.

Other rushees weren’t so sure if
they would even end up pledging.

Eric Schutz. a freshman from
Bethel Park, attended the event with
his roommate. “I’m not sure if I’m
going to pledge.” he said. “I don’t
know ifl want to be controlled by a
group. I heard that you get kicked out
if you don’t do certain things.”

Maybe our students are
smarter, or maybe they‘re just
better prepared. The Princeton

. Review is the nation's fastest

growing GRE course. And for »
good reason.

We keep our classes small (8 to
15 students) so you‘re
guaranteed plenty of personal
attention. If there’s a concept
that you don't understand, our
teachers will work with you
until you do. And four practice
exams help get you ready for
the real thing.

Look at our students’ average
final test scores, and you’ll see
how we measure up against the
competition.

Give us a call if you’d like your
score to climb off the charts.

Greeks ——

°From page 6

Mike Aspite, a freshman
from Langhorne-, said that
most of these stereotypes
originate from ignorance.
“You can’t say that unless
you’ve been there,” he said.
“You can’t be sure that it’s
true unless you come down
and see for yourself.”

Chris Fideli, rush chair-
man, said that meeting the
Greeks is important_ because
it gives independents the
opportunity to form an unbi-
ased decision based on their
own experience.

“Stereotypes stem from
fraternities’ histories,” he
said. “We learn from ele-
ments from history and
make ourselves better
today.”

Opinions

Heim|ichccm'i help here

Here we go again. We hope none of you had any real desire to
eat during the last few weeks of the semester, because Food
Services has been brainstorming again. Ithas come up with a
wonderful new plan to make money, at the expense of anyone
who has a meal plan. ‘

If you bought a meal plan last year, you may have been (and
probably were) left with a lot of unused BLOCKS by the end of
the term. That isn’t the case this year, though, since Food
Services has finally lowered the number of BLOCKS in each
plan. This is good, because you probably won’t be faced with
dumping the leftovers or losing the money at the end of the
semester. ‘ .

However, if you use all your BLOCKS before the end of the
semester, don’t plan on eating anything. The reason is because
although you can buy fewer BLOCKS, you will pay more for
them. Typical of Pitt’s latest financial—wizardry trend, when all
else fails, raise the price (enrollment drops,’raise tuition).

Marriott claims the increase in prices is necessary to make up
for the loss incurred last year. According to the Director of Food
Services, the BLOCK system had been priced according to an
estimate that not all BLOCKS purchased would be used. When
students actually got their money’s worth by using the BLOCKS
they-had purchased, Food Services went into a frenzy. How dare
you think-you can use the money you spend? ~

It seems a bit ridiculous torequire students to buy these meal
plans and then expect them not to use them. It is not the stu-
dents’ fault that Food Services made poor financial decisions,
and yet they are being forced to pay (literally) for those mis-
takes. It might not be a far cry to wonder if all this has some-
thing to do with why prospective students choose not to go to
Pitt. ' —
. There are two possible alternatives to this latest of meal plans
which might help both students and Food Services from losing
money. First, the entire meal plan could be changed over to a
program like Choice Dollars. Using a debit system, students will
be more aware of exactly how-much money they use on food.
That would be better than having to waste a $5.50 BLOCK to

‘ get a can of pop. The Second suggestion is that the money or

BLOCKS left over at the end of ‘thesemester be allowed to carry,
over to the following semester. ,
Either way, it would not be necessary to race the calendar in
order to dump hundreds of BLOCKS during finals week.
Students’ wouldn’t stand to lose- as_much money, and Food

‘Services wouldn’t risk too great a percentage being used.

Whatever is said or done, do not expect this to be the last time
the meal plans at Pitt change form. However, maybe it is time
that someone in the administration (Since last year proved that
Food Services has no interest in the opinions of Student groups)

_ step in and speak for the students’ interests instead of allowing

Food Services to choke every person who has a meal plan. isn’t
it enough punishment that they might have to eat cafeteria food‘?

Marianne  peo
Graham p 16
- a_re reading
plays by Shakespeare, they
often try to ﬁnd a deeper, hid-
den meaning. In The Tragedy
of Macbeth, a person can find
many things that have hidden
meaning such as blood, sleep,
weather, paradox, etc. It seems,
however, that in this workthere
are a few things which have a
deeper meaning that-have been
overlooked. If we assume, for a
moment, that Shakespeare was
really a soothsayer, then (like
Nostradamus) his predictions
seem to -have become
metaphors through time.
Reflecting on this, we can now
analyze some of the characters
in The Tragedy of Macbeth that

could relate incredibly closely _

to politicians living today.

Macbeth was determined to
be king and actually thought he
would make a good one. In
1992 there was a man who also
felt the same way.
(Coincidentally, they were both
wrong about their ‘ability to
lead.) His name is William
Jefferson “Bubba” Clinton.
Like Macbeth, Clinton
achieved his first goal of
becoming emperor with the
help of his glutton-charged
wife.‘Neither man could have
.done the evil deeds needed to
acquire his goal without a dia-
bolic force (i.e. their wives)
pushing from behind.

However, because of today’s
advance crime-solving tech-
niquesand the United States
Constitution, it was not as easy
for Clinton to become leader.
He could not just kill the presi-
dent (although if he had I’m
sure the liberal media would
have helped acquit him, and
probably make Clinton look
like the victim); “Bubba” actu-
ally had to campaign, which
reminds us of the titles and
awards Macbeth had to gain in
order to attain the consent of
enough unsuspecting kinsmen
to, in a way, elect him king.
Coinciding with Macbeth,

Clinton also had to continue his
evil deeds to remain in the
White House. Macbeth had
numerous people killed. Has
President “Bubba” Clinton
done the same? Does the name
Vince Foster ring a bell? The
probability that he committed
suicide ranks about as high as
the chance that King Duncan
did the same.

Moving on to Lady Macbeth,
we notice that her wretched
desire to become queen match-
es that of Hillary’s yearning to
become First Lady. ‘Lady
Macbeth was once revered by
King Duncan, and similarly
First Lady Clinton was once
idolized by the American pub-

lic. Both pushed their husbands J

for their own gluttonous suc-
cess. They even sacrificed
themselves so that their hus-
bands would not lose their
positions. Lady Macbeth tried
to convince people that she had
ki_lled King Duncan by making
them think the murder had dri-
ven her insane. When it came
to the Whitewater scandals,
First Lady Clinton (with illuso-
ry pipe dreams that good old
Bill could get her health care
reform bill passed) heroically
took the blame. However, in
both cases, it has become obvi-
ous that the wives have little or
no control over their husbands.
Macbeth continued to kill with-
out the knowledge of his wife,
and Bill Clinton continues his
embarrassing rampage of extra-
marital affairs. . A

Eventually, Macbeth lost his
Supporters because he was a
dishonest and cruel leader.
Clinton has also lost supporters

because of his poor leadership

ability, becoming most visible
on Nov. 8, 1994, when the
American voters retaliated by
putting Clinton’s worst ene-
mies, the conservative
Republicans, in control of the
House and Senate. The grateful
and distinguished conservative
Republicans celebrated as they
began to march from Great
Birnam Wood toward high
Dunsinane Hill. Clinton’s

approval rating continues to
diminish like the sanity of
Macbeth.

These frightful and astound-
ing coincidences between the
Macbeths and the Clintons help
support four interesting theo-
ries. Initially, Shakespeare (like
Nostradamus) could predict the
future, as The Tragedy of

Macbeth becomes The Tragedy ,

of Clinton. Secondly, history
does repeat itself. Thirdly, the
Clintons Shall suffer a Similar
fate as that of the Macbeths.
Their fate may not be a physi-

cal death but more‘ presumably

a political one. And finally, we
have proved that four years of
the Clintons does wonders for
the Republican Party.

AS the ‘96 elections and cam-
paigns begin. it is becoming
convincingly clear that the
American people will avenge
the harm that Bill and Hillary

Clinton have done to our coun-

try. Shortly, American citizens
will become Clinton’s

Macduff. The American people‘
shall slay Clinton with the vote

(which, of course, is much

’ more powerful than the Sword).

Subsequently, the few support-
ers the President still has
(mainly the liberal media) will
suffer the fate of Seyton
(Macbeth’s last Supporter
before his death). Yet there is

‘still another question to answer.
C 1 i n t o n ‘s-

Who will be
Malcolm. taking his rightful
place as the head of the coun-
try? Will it be Lord Dole‘? Or
Sir Perot? Could it be General
Powell? What about the Thane
of Texas. Sir Gramm‘? The
Thane of California. Pete
Wilson? Who among humanity
shall Stand, replenish our coun-
try, and restore our faith in
(‘‘Scotland, 0, Scotland!")
“America the Beautiful?" The
choice is no longer that of royal
blood but that of American vot-
ers. Register to vote. draw your
sword and restore your country.
Vote well my friends. our
future depends on you.

p o s t g a m e
press confer-
ence with a
smile from
ear—to-ear.
He couldn’t
Sean hold it back.
Duncan He was
ecstatic, and

  

rightfully so.

After all, Ryan was the
man who orchestrated two
Panther touchdowns within a
five-minute span in the
fourth quarter to give Pitt a
17-13 upset win over

, Washington State. But

Ryan’s happiness appeared '
deeper than simply landing
an opening-game victory
against a team that possessed
the second-best defense in
the nation last season.

There appeared to be a

glimpse of optimism in his

eyes. A sense of hope, like
something special was final-
ly spawning in Pitt footba1l’s
recently stagnant program.

Anyone who attended
Saturday night’s game can
attest that something weird
was happening. There was
indeed something different,
something very different
about the game.

At first I couldn’t quite put
my finger on it. I knew it
wasn’t the new digitalized
scoreboard that resembled a
giant Lite Brite, or the fancy
new tunnel that leads to the
new state-of-the-art locker
room. It was something big-
ger than that. ,

And then it hit me. There
were _fans there. Real fans.

fans who sit on their hands
until halftime and then

Nope. Almost all of the

efforts, they were rewarded
with a last-minute, game-

When Ryan connected with

strike, an unfamiliar noise
shook the stadium. Yep,

crowd going berserk, and it

players celebrated on the
field.

What’s going on? The fans

Panthers win opener, lose West I

 

By Mike Kovak
Asst. Sports Editor

In front of 35,513 screaming fans (for
the first time since approximately 1982),
the University of Pittsburgh football team
rallied late in the fourth quarter to upend
the favored Washington State Cougars 17-
13. _

Although the occasionwas joyous, Pitt
paid the price for the opening victory.

“It was great to open the season the way
we did,” head coach Johnny Majors said.
“But it was very costly." V

Reminiscent of last season’s second
game when Curtis Martin was injured,
star running (back Billy West suffered a
separated shoulder at the 7:29 mark of the
second period.

West will miss 3-4 weeks. '

Starting cornerback Denorse Mosley
suffered a strained lower-left leg muscle.
His status for Saturday is day—to-day.

After West was left to watch from the
sidelines, quarterback John Ryan and the
Panther_passing attack took over the
game. ‘ '

Using primarily slant or hook passes,
Ryan connected on_ 28 of 47 passes for
266 yards and two touchdowns plus three
interceptions, which usually hurt a quar-
terbacks efficiency rating.

“We made ‘a lot of dumb mistakes,”
Ryan said. “I made a lot of bad passes.”

There were a few dropped passes, too.

. Recently crowned Big East Offensive
Playerof the Week and Pitt’s all-time
receiving yardage leader with 2,345 yards
Dietrich Jells caught nine passes for. 131
yards and two touchdowns.

“I was excited about getting the yardage
record,” Jells said. “It wouldn’t have
meant much, however, if we wouldn’t
have won.” .

Jells’ hands, however, failed him more

than once, including a probable touch-
down on a wide open slant pattern.

‘-‘Our offense made enough mistakes to
lose three or four games,” Majors said.

Luckily, the Panther defense stepped up
with a marvelous performance. The
Cougars only managed 199 yards through
the air and 99 on the ground.

“Our defense did a magnificent job all
night-long. It was one of the more enjoy-
able defensive performances I’ve seen in

 

a long time,” Majors said.

The defense allowed the offense to
make as many mistakes as possible in a
coma-inducing first half that saw the two
teams trade one field goal a piece.

The score at halftime was deadlocked at
3-3.

The fans were once again bored into
slumber during the majority of the third
quarter as well.

The Lady Panthers‘ middle hitter, Jennie Driscoll, made the all-
tournament team at last weekend's George Washington
Tournament. She led all players with 14 kills in Friday's match
against Akron, and followed up with 17 kills against Maryland
and then 20 kills in the final match against George Washington.

olleyball iqk second at GW tournament

By Matt Grove

Two thumbs up this weekend for the University of
_ "Akron Lady Zips, led by Michelle Ebert, as they blew by
the competition at the George Washington Invitational

Akron shocked nearly the entire tournament field by
I going 4-0 and taking home the title. Lady Panther coach
' Cindy Alvear was surprised, but not shocked.

‘ 1‘ “Akron is a team of almost all juniors and seniors who
; have been playing together for the last few years, and it
E is starting to show,” Alvear said. ‘

The Lady Panthers went up against the Lady Zips in the
first match on Friday and lost three relatively close
, games, 15-12, 15-10 and 15-10. Akron was led by Ebert
C and Mandy Futchi, each with 13 kills. Chris Garrison
:  chipped in with 12 for the Lady Zips.

; Pitt’s Jennie Driscoll, who would eventually make the
 All-Tournament Team, led all players with 14 kills.
 Pitt looked to bounce back later that evening against
1 Portland, but once again the Lady Panthers could not find
 the rhythm. On the other ‘side of the net the Lady Pilots
 of Portland were soaring. S
- Alvear said of the Lady Pilots,“‘They came out fiery
1 and aggressive; they were definitely ready to play.”

Portland sent the Lady Panthers reeling to their second
loss of the evening in five games. A 16-14 Portland win
was sandwiched between a pair of Lady Panther wins,
15-9 and 15-4. Pittneeded only one win to seal the victo-
ry, but the Lady Pilots stayed in the cockpit and pulled
off two huge 18-16 wins to send Alvear and the Lady
Panthers plummeting to 0-2. Driscoll was the bright spot
for Pitt, recording a career-high 22 kills.

“Friday was just an ugly day for us all around,” Alvear
said. “The loss to Portland was rough because it could
have gone either way. We just had to put the losses

The,Pitt soccer team finished third
out of four teams in the inaugural
Pitt Soccer Classic, held last week-
end.

In the consolation game on
Sunday, the Panthers were able to
notch their first victory of the sea-
son against St. Francis (Pa.) College
on a goal by junior Brett Stezoski.

“It was a win,” coach Joe
Luxbacher said. “It wasn’t a pretty
game for either team. We didn’t

play real well. We played hard, but
not real well. Both teams may have
been a bit tired from yesterday, but
a win’s a win. To come out of the
weekend with a split is -what we
were looking for.”

Only a minute after the Red
Flash’s Bill Turner tied the game at
1-1 off a penalty kick, Stezoski
broke down the middle of the field,
past a defender and launched a shot
from 2-5 yards out. The ‘ball found
the upper-left corner behind goalie
David Godfrey, giving Pitt a 2-1
lead.

“Brett always plays 100 percent,”
Luxbacher said. “The goal was
purely effort. It was a great shot,
but he lost the ball, won it back off
the same guy he lost it to, and then
shot. He has that drive that we hope
all our players have, but they don’t.
Brett is always going high gear, and
that’s why he’s a good player.”

“We came back right away,”
Adam Spitzer, Pitt’s starting goalie
said. “That’s what we’ve got to do
because we’re not the kind of team
to keep putting them in. We’ve got
to take our chances and just put

them in that one time.” .

Mark Kopay got the Panthers 0}
the board with the first goal of th
game at the 20:00 mark of the firs
half off a Todd Graf pass.

The Panther’s defense was th
story, allowing the Red Flash I
only get off four shots on the da;
Spitzer had three saves to get hi
first victory of the season.

“We had to win thisto get on
roll going into the next couple c
games, because after that it’s all Bi

harder than it is now,” Spitzer said.

tion — after the game? I didn’t even know the fans could
stand. I just automatically assumed each fan was carted in
before each game and carted off after the game.

It actually resembled a Division I football game. Imagine
that, in Oakland. .

Jells, who has been stuck in this apathetic environment for
five years, noticed the difference, too.

“It felt great to finally have some fan support,” Jells said.
“It felt great to look up in the stands and not seeing anybody
leaving. That’s what the game is all about. When they sup-
port you, the feeling in the game just-changes.

“As long as we keep winning, the fans will keep coming
and supporting us. I know they were sick of coming and see-
ing games we got blown out in. I hope the fans keep support-
ing us.”

Wheaton, Ill., stepped u;
with 17 kills and led Pitt to 2
win over the Lady Terrapin:

13-15 and 15-8. At l-2, thc
Lady Panthers moved on tr
meet host George
Washington in the battle f0]
second place.

These two teams battled tc

 the limit, but once again

Jennie Driscoll stole the
show with 20 kills, a .395
hitting percentage, 10 digs

nd five blocks. This victory
was especially sweet for
Alvear and the Lady
Panthers. George

Washington knocked Pitt out
in the first round of the
NCAA tournament two years
ago, as well as defeating the
Lady Panthers in five games
last year, also at George
. Washington. 1

Alvear was excited abou
the performance from not
only her leaders, but also a
handful of newcomers during
the weekend.

“Freshmen Tara Haefnei
and Annemarie Tarara have
begun to.come into their own
early. Annemarie was excit-
ed to play GW, especially
because they recruited her
very extensively and it final-
ly came down the Pitt and
GW for her,” Alvear said.

“The younger girls playec
great, but with freshmen it is
always a matter of consisten-
cy. ‘Can they keep it up psy-
chologically?’ will be the
question. I hope they can.”
Alvear said.

The Lady Panthers will
travel to the great Midwest
to tangle in the Ball State
Tournament Sept. 8-9 along
with Kansas and Pacific.

“I think that when the end
of September rolls around,
we will have half of our loss-
es coming from the first day
of the season. I honestly feel
we can go 2-1, if not 3-0, in
the next two tournaments.
Because Ball State and
Akron are in the same con-
ference, a win over Ball
State next weekend would be
huge if they end up beating
Akron down the line,” said
Alvear on the Lady Panthers
upcoming matches.

“Hopefully, everything
will work out and these early
losses will be irrelevant
when it comes NCAA time,”

- Alvear said.
