 Commuters Thumb For Rides Medical PF01‘ Alleges
Admission Policy Bias

4.

BY MARK CELENDER

As the Port Authority Transit
(PAT) drivers’ strike stretches into
its third day today, Pi—tt’s commut-
ers are riding, biking and hiking to
school. ,

Almost 1,000 of the 18,719
commuters have participated in the
emergency carpool formed by
Student Government, according to
Joanne Levison, chairman of the
Emergency Carpool Committee.

Levison said during the PAT
drivers’ strike, Pitt's Emergency

L Carpool Committee, in conjunction

with Carnegie-Mellon students,

is trying to bring together
commuting drivers and riders that

share the same route on their way to
and from the Oakland area.

"We try to match them on the .

spot,” Levison said. “For instance,
if you're from the South Hills and
you need a ride, we give you all the
South “Hills” participating carpool
drivers’ names, addresses and
phone numbers and the routes they
take to Oakland. Then it's upto you
to get in touch with one of the
drivers and make arrangements.”

Levison said the committee's
main problems are ﬁnding drivers
in the Mt. Washington, Sheriden
and Mckees Rocks areas. They are
also having difficulty forming night
school carpools. “The night school
situation is bad because most
students are going home when the
night school people are just getting
here," Levison said.

For those students unable to find
rides, the bus strike is proving to be
costly and inconvenient. ‘

One student who wished to
remain anonymous, said, “Every-
one I talked to that owns a car in
East Liberty is asking three dollars
tor a ride into Oakland".

Board Lifts Freeze On
Programming Budget

BY MAGGIE MCKAY

The Student Government Board
(SGB) lifted a freeze on accounts of
the Student Government concert
and lecture programming commit-
tees at the SGB meeting Wednes-
day night, and agreed to give
concert programming a show-by-
show ﬂoating budget.

. A show-by-show ﬂoating budget
means the allocations committee
approves speciﬁc funds for a
concert but within that sum, the
concert committee has the ﬂexi-
bility to spend it as it sees ﬁt,
except for monies designated for
advertising and honorariums. The
limits set on these monies will be

. those designated in the original
budget. 1

While their account was frozen,
the concert committee was alloca-
ted money for speciﬁc events and
spending limits were set strictly
within each category—such as
equipment rentals and entertain-
ment costs.

Programming’s budget, frozen
the past several months has
generated many complaints and
problems concerning scheduling

and producing concerts, according

to committee members.

“A ﬂoating budget will give us
more ﬂexibility,” said Tim Stoops,
co-chairman of the Programming

committee. “As it is now, we have

to modify the budget for any little
thing. If we overspend on the
hospitality for any event or
underspend for equipment rentals,
we have to go to allocations and
give a rationale for a ‘budget
modification . ’ ’

Allocations froze the accounts,
according to allocations committee
member Josh Baylson, when the

lecture and concert committees:

showed deﬁcit spending for the
ﬁscal year which ended June 30.
The lectures committee deﬁcit
amounted to approximately $1,500,
while the concert committee went
over its budget to the tune of
$4,300, Baylson said.

“Neither one of the committees
approached us about the deﬁcit or
made provisions to recover the
money before the end of the ﬁscal
year," he said. “There was
deﬁnitely a lack of communication
between the groups and their

BY CRIS HALL

A former member of Pitt’s
medical school admissions com-
mittee has charged that admissions
practices in the School of Medicine
are unfairly biased in favor" of
children of that school’s alumni,
making it “three times as easy for
those students to gain admission.”

Dr. Robert H. Glew, an associate
professor of biochemistry who
resigned from the admission
committee a year ago because of
the alleged discrimination, said
Medical School alumni’s children

This, he said, means that some
“third-rate” applicants gain ad-
mission because of parental "links
Glew pointed to
statistics later conﬁrmed by the
Medical School that showed alumni
children’s MCAT scores 145 points
lower than those of all other
applicants, on the average.
Glew presented his allegations in

a letter to Chancellor Wesley‘

Posvar dated September 21 and
Posvar, after ordering an investiga-
tion, responded in a letter to Glew
dated November 9, stating:

“I think it is reasonable that I

alumni are provided courtesies not
extended to the general public and
I do not ﬁnd the data on admissions
confirms your allegations of
abuse.”

Thedata to which Posvar
referred was included, in a
memorandum from Dr. iusbert F.
Schuck, assistant dean for admis-
sions and medical education, to
School of Medicine. Dean Gerhard
Werner.

The memorandum, prompted by
Posvar’s inquiry, stated: \

“During the 1975-76 year, 45
alumni children were interviewed
as a part of the admissions process.
Alumni children accounted for 6
acceptances which is an acceptance
rate of 13 percent. Of the 697 total
interviews in 1975-76, 244 appli-
cants were accepted for an
acceptance rate of 35 percent.
Therefore, the acceptance’ rate
among alumni children was approx-
imately one-third of that of the
general pool of applicants inter-
viewed.”

Glew called the Chancellor’s
response “obscene,” claiming that
during his two years on the
admissions committee, he found
the children of alumni were
extended several unfair advan-
tages. .

“Almost all alumni children are
interviewed,” said Glew, “and this
puts’ them in an extremely

Posvar OK's Police Changes

BY PAUL MATHEWS

Chancellor Wesley Posvar re-
cently endorsed numerous recom-
mendations to improve the future
operation of the campus police
lorce and called for implementation
as soon as possible.

lhe recommendations deﬁne the
mission of the campus police, the
limits oftheir jurisdiction, the range
ol their services and their methods
ol enforcement. -

Posvar said the proposals are the
result of a lengthy investigation» by
the Chancellor's ad hoc task force
on campus security and a subse-

quent review by an administrative
study group into charges made by
internal and external critics of the
campus police.

“lhe Ad Hoc Task Force on
Campus Security's investigation
was prompted by criticism from a

specific community group concern- T

ed with the Campus police's arrest
procedures of juveniles, minorities
and others, as well as their concern
tor improving the relations between
the Oakland Community and the
campus police," he said.

Posvar also said criticism from
students over alleged incidents
involving the campus police and

suggestions through the years from

various other internal groups

supported the need for

investigation.

an

lhe final report from the
administrative study group said the
mission of the campus police is “to
protect university students and
personnel, their guests, and visitors
to the university and to protect
University property" and expanded
the mission to include such ancillary
services as the prevention, detec-
tion and investigation of crime;
parking control; and emergency
ambulance service .

Year ’Round Carpools

The Port Authority Transit drivers’ strike is now in its’ third day and
everyone is getting -used to a rush-hour Oakland whose streets
resemble a four-lalie parking lot.

Riders, forced to fend for themselves, have found the Golden
Triangle Association’s carpooling attempts a dismal failure. People
have  forced to wait on streetcomers for more than thirty minutes

‘ before offered a ride.

One solution that is working is Student Government’s carpool system
that has served 1,000 students so far. JoAnn Levinson and her
co-workers have done the impossible on short notice, much nlore than

organizations have accomplished. ,

Students can still participate in the program by seeking rides or
offering them. A i _
Perhaps the strike was a blessing in disguise. There is no reason

A whythis organized carpool system’ must disappear after the strike is

settled. ,
It took an emergency to force them to it, but drivers have learned the

A convenience of carpooling. If continued carpooling is encouraged,

Oakland parking problems can be alleviated. Bus riders canbeat the
inﬂated PAT fare. It offers beneﬁts galore for the commuting student.
A An organized carpooling system is needed twelve months a year, not
just whenthe bus drivers’ contract runs out. '

Faculty member charges

In the Preface to the Handbook
for Faculty of the University of
Pittsburgh, our current Chancellor,
Dr. Wesley, W. Posvar, expresses’
the thought that the contents of the
Handbook should reflect the
broader aspirations and philosophy
of the University and he encour-
-ages the faculty to exercise its right
to contribute to the _decision-
making process. In the next few

. pages we are cautioned with regard

to the matter of nepotism, and are
urged that University personnel
should never use their inﬂuence to
“get relatives hired” or to obtain
special consideration for relatives.
These remarks clearly inspire and
exhort us to respect the powers that
we possess as faculty members and
to conduct our professional lives in

a manner that will guarantee equal L

access to all citizens of the

' Commonwealth to the educational

services of the University of
Pittsburgh.’ Recent events, how-

ever, cause me to challenge the
sincerity of Dr. Posvar’s state-
ments. Several month_s ago, I
brought to the attention of our
intellectual leader and benefactor a
questionable policy that is cur-

rently being practiced by the

Admissions Committee of the
School of Medicine. As I described
to Dr. Posvar, it is the practice of
this Admissions Committee to
grant a formal interview to medical
school applicants whose parents

-are alumni or faculty of the

University of Pittsburgh, School of
Medicine. Dr. Posvar responded to
my letter by not only acknow-
ledging the practice but by stating
that:

“I think it is reasonable that
alumni are provided courtesies not

‘extended to the general public.”

I view this as the most arrogant
statement that I have ever seen
attributed to the president or
chagfellor of a public American,

Jennikins on experts

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

There have been some pro-
They
were a dependable bunch about ten
years ago, but it seems they are
less and less trustworthy. V
For every study expert A can
cite, expert B comes up with one

equally satisfying’ and, in fact,

convincing. Of course, as long as
they struggle and bite each other in
the safety of academia there are no
problems. i The problems arise
when they are carted off to
Washington to tell the administra-
tors of this country what to do.

You can see them in their long,
drab robes, squinting at this sheep
gut, or that knobby stone, snarling
and spitting at each other like a
pack of hyenas in a closet.

The economy is just one incident.
Our experts make nice, vague
statements in their own little
vernacular about this policy versus
that policy, taking time out to place
a tack on the seat of the ‘opposition.

'l‘he‘(.‘ongress or the President
listens attentively, seemingly ig-
norant of the scufﬂing and
shin-kicking under the tables. But
of course, they’re only bringing in
these ﬁne, expert gentlemen to
hear what they believed in the first
place. A

One view of the degenerating
situation was provided by a
professor Jennikins, a world-
famous expert in his discipline
who, when not sleeping in his
Department ofﬁce, can be found in
the seedy and irreputable confines
of a bar on the edges of the
Oakland campus.

university or one with extensive
state-relatedness. It is immediat-
ely repulsive and after some
reﬂection can only be interpreted
as a calous and ﬂagrant expression
of disregard and lack of respect for
the rights and aspirations of the
children of the parents whose tax
dollars support this University.
Rather than taking the position
outright that the practice of
granting interviews on the basis of
blood and birthright is disgraceful,
Dr. Posvar goes on to defend this
practice by stating that this type of
selective interview policy has no
ultimate impact on the decisions
reached by the Admissions Com-
mittee. Anyoneof the few faculty
members who have served on this
Committee and who appreciates
the complexity, subtlety, subject-
iveness and uncertainty of the
review process of the School of
Medicine would be less than candid
if they were to accept this patently

Jennikins had been privileged
recently to make a trip to
Washington to‘ testify before a
Congressional Committee about a
new ‘government policy.

Jennikins was in full support of
the new policy, since it meshes
nicely with his last publication in
the area in question.

.“It would have been a ﬁne trip if I

those stinking rabble-rousers from
Rutgers hadn't shownup,” Jenni-
kins said, breathing. through a
small, burning and ill-smelliing
German cigarette.

Jennikins took a philosophical
gulp of his » chilly beer C after
carefully removing his burning
butt. A A

“Everytime this issue comes up
in Washington those scum turn up,
waving their illegitimate studies
around like some kind of ﬂag. I’d
like to know how many statisticians
they blackmailed to their results.”

The Rutgers bunch were familiar
of Jennikins. _At the last Society
convention in New Orleans, Jenni-
kins and a colleague poured lighter
ﬂuid under the Rutgers contin-

‘gent’s door, hoping to burn the

entire crowd once and for all.

“A decent man can't even make
a point without some snotty junior
Congressman asking the Rutgers
crowd what they think about it,”_
Jennikins said, disgusted. “So of
course they get up and babble
about how everything my people
said is full of crap and howyit will
wreck the nation." A

“How?” Jennikins said glumly. ,

“You make statistics say anything
you want. ‘Everybody knows that.
Those tight snots at Rutgers can
perpetrate anything they want, and
go away scot free. Beats me how
they got tenure, some of them.”
“Don’t the Congress know you’re

wiping his fingers on his green-grey
apron.

“Of course they know I'm an
expert. But the damn fools think
the Rutgers people are experts too.
All they see is Nobel Prizes, science
awards and degrees.

“I tell you now,” Jennikins said,
swaying back and forth on the

barstool, “the existence of this
nation hangs by a thread. A W

thread! "

He sank into a sullen, silence.

“Aren't you guys supposed to,

'work these things out before you go

around telling people what to. do?”
the mailman asked. Unwittingly,

he struck a nerve.

Jennikins, a spark in his eyes,
dropped off his stool to face the

mailman, quite nearly erect even if

slightly to one side. ,

“Wise up friend,” Jennikins
said solemnly. “Academic, de-
bate's fine in discipline publica-
tions. But we’ve got to make a
decision here. The new policy is

for friendly chats...," he hiccup-
ped.

“The Rutgers people have a few
points; admittedly, but right now
my people are right, and we need
to act now. Before it’s too late,”
Jennikins said dramatically.

‘‘Well. I’m behind you, Jenni-
kins," the mailman said.’-

“Count on me, Jennikins,” the
bartender said.

“Kick ass!" wailed the drunken
Trotskyitc at the back of the bar.

“Gentlemen, let us hope the
Congress sees it in the same
light," Jennikins pronounced, and
heaved himself out of the door,

fully. ‘

Undercover Under Fire Braves Maneuvers

   

BY KEN GORMLEY

One thing our generation has
missed out onr_.is wars. There just
haven't been any for a while. Sure,
we’ve all heard tales of Vietnam and
Korea, but few of us have charged
through the jungles with riﬂes in
our hands.

Of course, there are still a few
people in the University who know
what it’s like to be in the army. You
know-—those funny looking guys
with hair cropped down to their
skulls and silly green uniforms.

Lots of students give the
R.O.T.C. boys a hard time when
they see them around campus.

But I never make fun of the poor
blokes. I’ve always considered
them harmless buffoons. So when
Bob from the R.O.T.C. invited me to
go on a day of maneuvers with the
Army Reserves, I couldn't resist.

Did I have any doubts that I could
hackthe army life? Of course not. I
had been a real sharp-shooter with

Greeny-Stickum’ caps in my
younger days.
YOU’RE IN THE ARMY NOW...

Somewhere in the back of my
inebriated mind, I heard ' the
doorbell ringing. Instinctively, I
rolled out of my bed onto the ﬂoor of
my apartment, and tried to stand
up.

Aarghl ‘My head was spinning,
and my stomach felt like an old
washing machine ready to overﬂow
from too many soap_suds. The clock
on my desk came‘ slowly into

focus-quarter of seven in the
morning. ‘
“Who am I,” I gasped,

scratching my aching head.
“Where am I?”

And then I remembered. I was
me.‘ And I was suffering from two
illnesses: a hangover from a
whooping-good party the night
before, and side-effects from that
blasted Swine-Flu shot (which I had
foolishly gotten just because it was
free).

The doorbell rang again. “Who
in the devil can that be this early in

r the morning,” I cursed. Stumbling

down the hallway, I threw open the
door. It was Bob from R.O.T.C.,

_dressed up in his battle outfit.

“Oh no,” Imoaned. “It can’t be
time already."

Bob nodded his head enthusias-
tically. “Yep. Grab your stuff and

you can get dressed in the
Cathedral. We're running a, little
late.” ‘

Late? 1 had just gone to bed. But
I had no time to plead for another
half hour of sleep. By the time I
opened my eyelids again, we had
pulled up in front of the Cathedral of

‘ Learning.

Bob handed me my Army
fatigues, and went to buy breakfast.
My stomach did triple-somersaults
as 1 stuffed myself into the small
green pants and straight-jacket-like
shirt.

Gasping for breath, I waddled
back into the hallway, just as Bob
returned.

“Eat these," he said, handing
me some cinnamon- donuts and
black coffee.

“I don’t know if I should. I don’t
really feel..."

“Go ahead and eat them. They’ll
do wonders for you.”

Reluctantly, I picked up a donut,
staredat it suspiciously, and took a
smallbite out of it. It fell down into
the pit of my stomach like a lead
weight.

“That sure is a good donut Bob,”

1' Isaid. “Can you save this for me?

I'll be right back.”

I handed him the rest of my
pastry, stepped into the lavatory,
and vomitted violently into the
commode. \ »»

“Let’s go,” Bob said when I
returned, slapping me on the back
and almost. jarring . loose what
remained in my gut. “We have a
war to fight.”

I sucked in my gut, puffed out my
chest, and swayed in the early
morning breeze, doing my best not
to throw-up on the Colonel's shiny
boots.

When it came time for lunch, my
head was still aching and my
stomach still in knots, but I had
worked up a powerful hunger. So I
grabbed a box of C-rations and sat
down to eat with the other men.

Hmmm-it all looked pretty good.

There were separate cans of
chicken, peanut - butter, and
crackers. And what was this? A

surprise package ﬁlled with tooth-

After picking up my weapon,
(an M-16 riﬂe with a little safety
device over the barrel) Bob and I
headed for Settler’s Cabin Park.

Still in a daze, I crawled out of the
car. There were about 50 other guys
dressed in army outﬁts milling
around the place.

Some ofﬁcer wearing a green
beret stepped out of the crowd.
“Attention!” he yelled. “Fall into

came close to it. Thick, muscular
strands of pink gooey meat...it

didn't even look good enough to

serve to an alley cat.

Starved as I was, I ate some of the
less-offensive chunks, and threw
the can down on the table.

“Don’t you want the rest of
that?” the guy next to me asked,

drooling, as he shoved crackers and
slop into his mouth. I shook my
head.

The man deserved a Purple
Heart. He shoveled down the rest of
my chicken, belched contentedly.

Shortly after I polished off the
rest of my grub, the Colonel called
us to attention. It was time for the

commander said with his teeth
clenched, pointing to a heavily-
wooded mountain in the distance.

“You have your directions men,”
he concluded. “Now move out.”

Out platoon sneaked quietly up a
small hillside, and down the other
side to a row of thick jagger bushes.

“Down on your bellies,” our
platoon leader whispered tensely.
“We have to crawl up to. the

Lunch at “Peter ’s ” Idea

BY PETE BUTCH

Fancy gourmet cooking in a
stuffed-shirt atmosphere—that’s
the last thing one needs when
looking for a place for lunch.
"Instead, the ideal is a place like
Peter’s Pub on Oakland Avenue. A
good, quick lunch for around two
dollars, just what the common
person needs. ,

The tavern has a warm, cozy,
atmosphere that's just right for the
cold months ahead. It features a
menu of hot and cold sandwiches
and salads prepared in its own
kitchen.

.We got there around 11:30 a.m.,
and no crowd was there yet. The
waitress, who was very cheerful
and courteous, promptly took our
order.

'Brel' Marred By Blackout

BY LEN ROMBERG

Jacques Brel is famous for his
songs of love, sex, death, war and
people. L They are serious yet
humorous, sarcastic yet straight-
forward, but most often pessimis-
tic.

These qualities have been
effectively maintained in English
adaptations, making the musical
“Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well
and Loving In Paris” worthwhile
seeing.

The French songwriter became
popular throughout the 1950s and
60s for his witty lyrics. In January
of 1968, the musical consisting of
his songs rewritten in English
opened in New‘ York off Broadway,
eventually moving to Broadway for
a brief time. ’

The musical consists of approx-
imately 24 songs, presented one
after another with noldialogue in
between. The opening song,
Marathon, sets the themes for all
following numbers. It is a musical
trip through time, from the world of
the roaring twenties until the end
of the century which is presented
as a world of mechanical men.

“If We Only’ Had Love,” the
concluding and only optimistic
number, summarizes his music by
wishing for everything the world
lacks. Brel’s music is very
emotional, sensitive and at points
even eyebrow-raising. He will
have the audience laughing one
minute and crying the next.

But the Studio Theatre’s produc-
tion is disappointing, suffering
from many overt problems. They
cut the show’s potential consider-
ably \by eliminating [some ten
songs, many of which are strong,
important numbers. The audience,
though, had no way of realizing this
because the basic essentials for any

‘ shoiiv, a program listing the musical

numbers and credits, were miss-
ing.

With only 60% of _a show
presented, the songs looked more
like 14 individual units rather than
one coherent show. This was not
because of a poor performance, but
due to the blackouts between each
number/.

Blackouts were long and unnec-
essary. A multi-platform stage
looked great but worked against
the actors, making entry and
exiting difﬁcult for them. Costume

changing, which also was not
needed, compounded the scene

Though certain numbers appear-
ed underchoreographed, they were
nevertheless effective. Three
outstanding songs were Made-

which featured an effective light-
ﬂickering to simulate the slow-
motion action of a turning carousel.

Mastro and Barry Brunetti—per-

superior in loudness and quality.

This production displayed great
potential and could have easily
been made into a success by
dispensing with blackouts, keeping
the actors and actresses on stage
and simply by doing more of the
show. ,

lhe blackouts the reviewer refers
to,were due to a malfunctioning
sound system the night of Nov. 30.
Because of this the tapes that would
have provided the background to
the play could not be played. The
equipment has been fixed and the
tapes are being played, "giving the
stage action the necessary context

Patti Smith: Beatnick,  
Poet, Prophetic Artist

Radio Ethiopia
Patti Smith Group
Artista Al4097

BY JIM F ARERI

Brevity may be the soul ofwit, but V

a discussion of Patti Smith's Radio

Ethiopia could end up somewhere in ’

the classifieds.

This sliver ofa girl has been billed
as everything from‘ counter-culture
rip-off to street-punk princess to
Serious Artist of the Decade. Her
name and mug have been bantered
around in a plethora of contexts, but

seldom does talk of her music‘

appear in print.

Despite the confusion that shroud
her public image, Smith knows the
artist in her well and is sure about
what she’s doing. Much of her
inspiration comes from the nine-
teenth century French poet Rim-
baud. Like him, Smith views art as a
release from an external order that
is imposed on the individual; the
artist is a rebel _and iconoclast who
creates and lives his own view of
existence.

Thus Smith is a ’70s beatnick,
very much a poet, but swearing by
her Fender duo-sonic as the
ultimate poetic device of the atomic
age.

l-ler band is made up of the
classical rock instruments, helped

by some synthesizing and advanced ”

production techniques. The rhythm
in her music is usually strong, and,
in the harder numbers, pounding.
Lenny Kaye plays a sharp lead
guitar in the nonchalant spirit the
band works under. Patti sings like
she's tripping, often fast, inaudible,
muted, full of shifts and fluctuations
like the flickering wave‘ of an
oscilloscope. I ‘

The overall effect of the band's
style is to induce the listener into a
state of semi-consciousness and

liberate the rebellious and spontan-
eous elements of his spirit.

Smith believes that hard rock is
one way artists gain new freedom,
and there are two excellent
exhibitions of that genre on Radio
Ethiopia. “Pumping (My Heart)”
is the kind of tour de force in
nastiness that made her the patron
saint of many avant-garde rock
circles. p

‘‘Ain’t It Strange" is Smith's
brand of rock-reggae graced by her
twisting; vocal and Kaye’s tasty
imitation of eastern string instru-
ments on his Fender Stratocaster.
Beginning like some familar Stones’
piece, but ending in a surrealistic
description of being high, “Pop-

pies" is the most intresting piece on‘

this L.P. _
The last track on the album is
“Radio Ethiopia/Abyssinia," a

twelve-minute mess of vagrant’

sounds. it can't be appreciated as
music or poetry, and even fails as
the experimental mood piece that it
tries to be.

But putting aside the title track,
Radio Ethiopia is not just the most
progressive album of the year, but
alsothe finest. Smith is one of those
prophetic artists who can advance
their craft by leaps while everyone
else creeps along.

Pitt Players, Coaches,

Dad Reflect On Win

BY STEVE SYBERT
\ Sports Editor

Not surprisingly, people are still talking about lhe Pitt Panthers’
dramatic 24-7 victory over Penn State a week ago at Three Rivers
Stadium. And why not? When that long-awaited conquest ﬁnally
comes, people SHOULD be jubilant, especially the players, who went
out on the field with only one objective in mind--to get Pitt its ﬁrst win
over State since the narrow 30-27 victory in 1965.

“This was our biggest win here,” said Head Coach Johnny Majors.

‘ ‘Fantastic. lt’s the greatest thing that’s ever happened to me,” said
an understandably ecstatic Carson Long. “Greatest. Greater than
anything else I've ever done, period. Except sign here.”

“I feel like standing on thehighest mountain in Pittsburgh and
saying, ‘.We‘re number one,’ ” defensive tackle Don Parrish said after
the win. “Although [want to be the national champion, this might be, if
not more, as equally important as the national championship, because

it's something we've been working for a long time.”

Four years is a long time, especially for the 41 Pitt seniors, who,
despite contributing towards Pitt’s winning seasons, suffered through
losses- of 35-13, 31-10 and 7-6 during the last three frustrating games
with arch-rivl Penn State.»

Was it the biggest win for the Pitt seniors--even bigger than the
victories over Notre Dame and the great Sun Bowl showing last season?

“I think so,’ ’ said senior center John Pelusi, ’ ’because it was the only
team we hadn't beaten in the four years I've been here that we’ve played
in a continuing series." ‘

‘ ‘I realize there are other people on this team who have played against
Penn State four years,” offered Heisman Trophy winner Tony Dorsett,
who ran for 224 yards against the Lions, ’ ’but there's no way any of them
can feel any better about this win that I do.”

Important as the Penn State game might have been as a single game,
the win also meant an undefeated season and a possible national title for
Pitt, if they can hold their number-one ranking by knocking off Georgia
in the Sugar Bowl on New Year's Day.

“This is probably the tops," junior quarterback Matt Cavanaugh
enthused. “As each game goes on you try to look at your performance
and you try to rank it, but when you go undefeated and you’ve got a
chance for a national championship, that’s got to be the top thrill.”

And what about the coaches, who have done almost everything with
the team save getting into the action on the field?

Said Assistant Head Coach Joe Madden, ‘ ‘It's just the happiest day of
my life. I couldn't be more elated. lt_’s just a great, great victory for our
squad and the culmination of a heck of a lot of work by everybody and I’m
just extremely happy for our players."

“It's just probably the biggest win in the history of this school, to be
honest with you, " suggested Assistant Coach Dave Cox. ‘ ‘You can’t say
anything but cliches in a situation like this, but this is a team of destiny
like Coach Majors says and I think we'll win the national title.”

(Continuedion Page 14)

 

Pitt coh Johnny Majors, pondering whether to jump to Teessee, '

here," Jennings said--unofficially
of course. "The players feel sure he
is coming. It looks like he is here
from everyone down here. They've
done everything but change the
nameplate on Battles door."

Bill Battle, remember, is the
now-ex-'l‘enne_sj;§§e*?-coach who re-
signvaiijltflovenifbfer 20 under pres-
sure opeiningiti/ie door for all this
speculation that Majors would leave
Pitt for his alma mater and all the
blessings of home sweet home,
including a lucrative salary ar-
rangement reported to consist of a
$48,000 base pay, $20,000 for the
rights to football playbacks and
$32,000 for endorsements.

I ennessee folks are treating the
situation “like the Messiah is
coming back," Jennings said, and
even have begun to sport bumper
stickers reading “Bring Majors
Back" and “Johnny Come Home.”
And they already are talking about
Majors’ debut in the annual spring
Orange and White game, when
80,250 people are planning to fill the
Volunteers‘ stadium to welcome
back their favorite son.

:What are the people up here to
think? Is Majors gone? If no, then
what? '

A decision must soon be
reached--whether it will be this
weekend is still uncertain. Slowly
creeping up to all this confusion is
the very important December 11th
Southereastern Conference signing
date for recruits. At Tennessee, ior
example, Jennings said 17 recruits

have been tabbed, but 16 have been_

in a waiting period since Battle's
resignation. All along, Volunteer
recruiters have been proposing to
prospects that Majors would be
coach.

“All Majors has to do is say that

similar situation must be present at
Pitt.

According to reports, Tennessee
Athletic Director Bob Woodruff
flew to Pittsburgh to talk with
Majors on Saturday, the day after
the Panthers won their eleventh
game of the season, over Penn
State, and maintained their hold on
the nation's number-one ranking.

With the Pitt team staging its
banquet last evening, there was
speculation that Majors might
reveal his decision. But, with a
crowd of Golden Panthers, financial
supporters of the football program,

(ff-lo last season) were paced by

right time and place to say he was‘

staying, not that he was leaving.

"Now is the time for me to settle
on what I want for a long career,"
Majors said early this week. \ "But it
has not always been on my mind to
return to»'l'ennessee, It's never been
 lifelong ambition‘ of mine to
return." '

"I will decide later this week, I
hope so." ‘ K

Majors was to have met with Pitt
officials also this week, then talk
with his family and the Panther
squad before arriving at his
decision.

GRID NOTES: Ara Parseghian,

said to be a prime candidate for the 7

head coaching position at Pitt
should Majors leave, is reportedly
going to the Atlanta Falcons for
$125,000, according to a reliable
source of Jennings, though the
former mentor at Notre Dame had
insisted he would never coach

Dorsett and middle guard Al

and 12 rebounds but had little help

inconsistent, as they had been in
previous home victories over

game) and West Virginia Wes-

consistency. We seem to play well
for about five minutes, and then
have a five minute lapse and that's

Pitt jumped off to an early
nine-point lead, la-0, as Harris was
hot early, but Grgurich was
wliistled for a two-shot technical

and the Panthers suddenly seemed
to lose the momentum they had
built in the early going.

Skaggs put the Bobcats ahead for
the first time, 16-17, on a jumper
from the corner at 3:14, after which
the lead changed hands four times
before Harris hit a baseline jumper
with 1:29 to go for a 27-26 Pitt lead.
frank Boyd converted a foul shot at
the conclusion of the half to give Pitt
a 26-20 lead at intermission, but
both Harris and Rice carried three
fouls to the locker room, a result of
some tight opening-half officiating.

Pantherettes Prepare For Pitt Invite

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

Pantherette basketball begins
this weekend with the third annual
Pitt Invitational. Last season, Pitt
finished second to Cheyney State,

_ but with the defending champ

-cancelling, it could be anyone’s
ballgame. ‘

The competition will include East
Stroudsburg (who Pitt beat out in a
close contest in last spring’s
regionals), Slippery Rock, ' Edin-
boro, Penn State and West Virginia.

Unlike the case. in previous years,
the finalists will be selected from
pool play instead of the traditional
block style--this means each team
must play two games before the
final competition, instead of being
divided into quarter-final play.

“In a way, it's to our advantage
because we know when we're

playing, " said head coach Pat
Wallace. She added that the
competition in the field ‘ looks

strong, particularly Penn State,
which has added speed this season

Tankers ldo|ize”Rout

  Of Temple

BY JIM GEFSKY

For the tankers, it was,a great.
way to get their feet wet. ‘ Last
Satu.rday at Trees Pool, Pitt routed
Temple, 74-39, winning almost
every event and placing swimmers
third or fourth only four times all
day. .

Panther victors included Dale
Pflaumer in both the 500-yard and
1000-yard freestyle, Jerry DeMuro
in the 200-yard freestyle, Steve
Leach in the 50-yard freestyle, Bill
Wagner in the 200-yard individual
medley, Tom Fatyol in both the one
and three meter diving, Bill Moser
in the 200-yard flystyle, Dave Civis
in the 100-yard freestyle, Neal
Wallace .in the 200-yard backstroke
and Mike Connor‘ in the 200-yard
breaststroke. .

The tankers would have fared
even better had they not chosen to
run several exhibitions, such as the
400-yard free relay that Pitt also

4 captured.

“It was a «fairly easy match,”
said head coach Dick Bradshaw,
“and we were able to review our
freshmen. Although the match was
no, challenge, from it we believe
more so than ever that we have
excellent depth.”

a. Tomorrow, the Panthers travelto
University Park for the Penn State
relays, a mini-version of the
Easterns. This will be the first real
test for the tankers, with the
presence of such schools as
Bucknell, Maryland, and East
Carolina. Pitt won the relays last
year, and the Panthers are favored

, to repeat.

The divers had already seen
some action before the Temple

In Opener

match. Several weeks ago, they
won the Penn State International
Diving Championship by almost

200 points over Ohio State, their

closest rival, and Fatyol won the
three-meter dive for Pitt in the
Clarion International Diving Meet"
earlier this year.

The tankers have every reason to
look forward to the entire season.
Last year Pitt was 10-1, and won
the Easterns.
just as promising, if not more.
DeMuro, Wagner, Wallace, Civis
and Orlando Catinchi' are strong
returning performers, and will be
joined by freshmen Connor and
Pflaumer. Pitt has also acquired
Mark Schman, a junior transfer
from Drexel. \

Bradshaw is very optimistic.
_“We have the potential to better
last season's achievements," he
said. “We have strong depth and
excellent talent in every event. Our
only problem is a tough schedule,
which includes dual meets with
Ohio State, Maryland and a
much-improved West Virginia.”

Diving coach Al Coffey is quite
pleased with the diving. “With the
return of Fatyol and Dave Reeder,
plus freshman Scott Winkler, we
will have one of the top teams in
the nation,” he claimed. “I’m
trying some new‘ training techni-
ques this year, the divers are inthe
water earlier than ever and we’re
increasing the amount of ﬁlms.”

As of now the tankers have high
hopes, but after the relays
tomorrow, the Panthers will have a
far better view of just how good
they really are.

This year appears /

and Edinboro, which has a transfer
in from lmmaculata.

lhe quality of competition is not
only better in the tournament, it is
significantly better in terms of the
season. Pitt-(16-8 last season) will
take on Federal City College, the

University of Maryland (new school

of former Pitt super center Debbie
Jones) and lmmaculata, the UCLA
of women's basketball.

"The schedule is considerably
harder than it was last year,"
Wallace said. “As far as I'm
concerned, lthiiik we're going to be
better this year. To be ateam on the
national level, you have to play‘
teams like we’re playing this
season."

Pitt doesn't have the advantage
of home court often this season.
Due to the expense of road trips,
they will go play several teams in a
span of a couple of days.

"One trip is four games in five
days. We'll take on lmmaculata and
Maryland. About all we can hope is
that we don't have any injuries,”
Wallace said. “Because of the
expense, we only have ’a traveling
squad of twelve. If we want to play

the big ones, though, we have to
travel."

Speaking of injuries, the Pant-
herettes haven't been spared in the
preseason. Wallace has yet to
announce her lineup for Friday’s
contest with East Stroudsburg.

"Right now, it's going to depend
on who's healthy. Matter of fact,
this is the first week we've had over
15 healthy players," Wallace
revealed.

Of the three juniors on the squad
(they also serve as tri-captains), all
are injuried. Most notably, 5-11
forward Kim Raymond, who is
suffering from a knee injury.

Forwards Dianne Zaken and Mimi.

Senkowski are doubtful starters for
the tourney.

"Once we get Kim back, we’ll
have help under the boards,”
Wallace noted.

"1 think the biggest thing we
have to work on is consistency," she
continued. “We had patches where
we played extremely well last
season, but than we’d start making
mistakes."

Consistency may be a hard
attribute to come by. There are

many new faces on the team. The '

top prospect for the Pantherettes is
6-3 center Wanda Randolph, whose
fine showing in the preseason
massacre of Robert Morris College
indicates the loss of Jones is not all
that crucial.

"She'syoung," Wallace said. “I

look fora lot of improvement from.

her, from all ofthem, lthink that as
the season goes on, they'll get into
their roles." A

Wallace sees Pitt's fast break as
the strong point of its offensive
attack. Sophomore forward Barb
Welsh is returning with a 10.2
scoring average to pace the team
and Senkowski, who garnered 6.8
during the last campaign, gives the
team a strong one-two punch.
Preshman guard Kathy Paczkowski
is expected to be a big help, also,
when she is off the injured list.

Defense, however, was always
the strong point of Pitt's game.
Wallace emphasizes balance-—
“We can't rely on one or two
people"—and the need for more
aggression.

"1 think that when it jells, we're
going to be an ‘exciting team to
watch," Wallace said.

    Pitt Pricks Akron, 36-16

BY JIM LEWIS

You’d swear it was black magic.

The Pitt wrestling team practiced
voodoo on helpless Akron Satur-
day, sticking pins into their hosts
and emerging with an easy 36-16
victory in their season debut. A

The pins were provided courtesty
of freshman Ed Bredniak (1-42 lbs.)
and juniors Skip Bolin (167), Bruce
Huggler (177), and Bill Bailey
(190).

Bredniak started the Akron
pin-cushion rolling by stopping
Denny Brady in 4:36. Bolin took as
little time to pin his opponent, Bill
Talcott, using up only 4253.

Huggler outdid everyone in the
very next match, however, halting
Ron Betz in a fast 2:43, while
Bailey finished off Tom Prokopchuk
at 6:28 to help secure the win
against the hapless Ohioians.

Akron isn’t a spectacular team;
the fact is, they hardly measure up
to the Panthers this year.

“-I can’t say they were a good
team,” coach Dave Adams recall-
ed. “They’re about a class below
us.”

And if Akron didn’t get that

  Bobcats Bite ‘Bounders

( Continued from Page 13}

Uhio U. remained in a tight
man-to-man defense when play
resumed and the Panthers were
having difficulty finding the hoop.
lhe Bobcats slowly widened the
niai'gin,.outscrapping the Panthers,
who at one point missed three
cgiisecutive layups.

',:Rice'and Lewis then found the
range, however, and led the
Panthers to within one, 43-42, at the
midway point of the second half.
Pitt turnovers and freshman
mistakes proved costly, though, as

~ the Bobcats went on a 16-7 tear to

lead by ten, 56-48, with 5:12 to go in
the game.

lhe Panthers decided to make
things interesting at this point, as
they again battled back to trail,
02-60, with 2:13 showing on the
clock as Scott Nedrow scored on a
steal and a layup. Ohio U. went cold
alterslowing their pace to try to use
up the clock.

But in the final minutes, the
pendulum swung back the other

~ way as the Bobcats hit 10 of 10 "at the
foul line, while Pitt could muster
only a pair of free throws from
Wayne Talbott in the lineup.

And so the Panthers went down
the drain for the first time in the new
season, with the only bright spots
being a strong inside game by Rice
in the second half and spurts of
brilliance from Sonny Lewis.

Overall, though, Urgurich's
young Panthers just haven't put it
together yet, andilace a very stiff
test at the l-ield House Saturday
when the Atlantic Coast Conference
deleiiding champion Virginia
Cavaliers come to town for an 8 p.m.
tipoll.

Ranked lath in the nation last
season after being eliminated in the
first round of _the NCAA Tourna-
ment by l)ePaul, 69-60, the Cavs of
coach lerry Holland bring in a very
impressive lineup with eight of last
year s nine top players returning.
lhe only iioii-returnee is Wally
" W onderlul" Walker, presently

employed by the Portland Trail-
bla2ei's ol the NBA. lhe Cavs are
currently 2-0, having recently won
their own lip-off lournament by

besting Roanoke and VMI. Leading -

Virginia will be big men 6-8 senior
Marc lavaroiii and 6-11 sophomore
Utis Pulton, and backcourt aces.
Billy Laiiglohaiid l)a-ve Koesters,

rulton has been bothered by a sore
knee, however, and there is some
doubt as to whether he will play.

AlFAmerican Kathy Stetler and
Puerto Rican Olympic team mem-
ber Angie Lopez will be just two of
the many talented Pantherette
swimmers competing in the Third
Annual Pitt Invitational Swimming
and Diving Relays at Trees Hall
pool tomorrow, with preliminaries
set for 10 a.m. and ﬁnals at 4 p.m.
Thirteen teams will be vying for the
title the Pantherettes captured last
year, including powerhouses In-
diana, Penn State, Pitt and Ohio
State.

' point after Bredniak, Bolin, Hugg-

ler, and Bailey were through, they
they found it out after Bill Clark,
Steve Carter, and Mark Stepan-
ovich dealt with their foes.

Clark (118) and Carter (126), both

freshmen, were impressive as they

opened the meet with victories.

Clark defeated Leon Allen 10-1,

while Carter followed with a 3-1
squeaker over Dan Bricker.

In the ﬁnal match of the day,
Stepanovich (heavyweight) stuck
Akron with yet another setback,
destroying Eric Porosky 20-3.

All in all, it was a good showing
for the Panthers (1-0), although
Adams wasn’t totally pleased.

“I was hoping we’d win more.

matches,” he said. “But overall, it
gave us a bit more insight as to
where we are. It gives us
information about ourselves, and
that was what we were looking
for.”

And the information Adams
received was good and bad.

First, the bad informationl.
Greg Soergel, senior 134 pounder,
suffered a knee injury in his bout
which requires an operation, a task
that will put him out of action the
rest of the season.

Second, the good information:
All three starting freshmen (Bred-

niak, and Carter) were outstanding
in their ﬁrst exposure to collge
wrestling.

“Any time you 'win with 2

freshmen, you’re happy," Adams
claimed. “But we are lacking
experience right now. Some things
that happened to us happened
because of lack of experience.”
Hopefully those “things" will be
corrected in time _for Friday, when
Pitt travels to the Penn State
Invitational Tournament. The
two-day tournament features some
of the best teams in the east, with
such notables as Michigan State,
Clarion, Syracuse, Lehigh, Navy,
Virginia, and the host Nittany Lions
participating. 1

“All of the teams are nationally
ranked, except ourselves and
Virginia,” Adams said. “This is a
good way to start the season off. It
will tell a lot about ourselves—how
far we have to go in relation to
these teams. The better the
competition, the better you be-
come, if you’re any type of a
competitor at all.”

And Pitt is a competitor. If the
Panthers do well at University
Park, then a lot of teams had better
learn needlepoint in self-defense.

Victory Over Nittany Lions
“Greatest” For Panthers

(Continued from Page 13).

But the proudest person in the Pitt locker room was neither a player
nor a coach, but Anthony Romano, father of Outland Trophy candidate

Al.

“It's a great win for Pitt,” Al began. "How many teams get to go
11-0? Really--we’ve got the first and the last and allthe ones in

between.”

“Hey. You want his father to quote him?" butted in Mr. Romano,
despite Al's pleas to leave. “No, really. They blew Notre Dame off the
field the first game and they blew Penn State off the last game. Who

could be number one?”

“Are you really his dad?" I ventured.

“Sure l’m his dad."
“Is this some kind of a..."

"He's had a long day," explained Al.
“I look like his brother, don't 1? Sure I'm his dad.”

“Let's get out of here dad."

"I'm just telling him we're good.

How can you say anything

different? The first game we blow Notre Dame off the field and the last
game we blow Penn State off the field. They’re the two greatest teams in
football, I don't care what anybody thinks. I'll bet even money that

Notre Dame beats Southern Cal.”

Notre Dame got beat, 17-13, the next afternoon.

A few shotsblasted out fromgthe

loaded my M-16 full of blanks, and
let them have it.

“Let's go men,” our platoon

All of our forces came pouring out

By this time my head was

While the other soldiers re-loaded

"That's right. You're platoon

The enemy had moved to the top
of the next small mountainside. I
led my men to a clearing right

heads bobbingaround.

While we opened up fire on the
enemy to divert» their attention, the
rest of the good-guys snuck up on
them from the sides. Brilliant
strategy. But I wanted in on the
action. Those other platoons
weren't going to get all the glory of
capturing the enemy.

Besides, this horseplay had gone
far enough. I was tired of crawling

ALEX HALEY

ROOTS is the long-awaited, magnificentauthobiography
of Alex Haley's family, from his ancestors Kunta Kinte,
who in 1750 was captured just outside his tribal village
in West AFrica and brought to America as a slave, down
to the birth of Haley himself. Kunta eventually married
and taught his heritage to his daughter, who taught it to
her children. Thus the story of Kunta Kinte and his horhe
in Africa was passed from generation to generation. Alex
Haley shares it with us in ROOTS—he moves us with his
research, his discoveries, and most of all, the rich saga of
one American black family that is representative of all.

Alex Haley has spent 11 years trying to find the key to
his‘ past, and by extension, the past of all black Ameri-
cans (”We all came here the same way.") The author of
The Autobiography of Ma/com X, he has been awarded
five honorary Doctorates for his work on ROOTS. Dav-
id Wolper is producing an 11-hour film series based on
this book to premiere on ABC one week after pub.

TRINITY

LEON URIS

First. the next time you see those
funny looking guys with hair
cropped ‘down to their skulls and
silly green uniforms—don’t make

snide remarks about them. Give '
. them your admiration.

It takes a. rarebreed of humans to
go through army drills, eat
C-rations, and devote a life-time to
protecting those of us who aren't cut
out for Army life. ,

The second lesson to be learned is
this. If there's another war, put on
your army jacket, grab your canteen
and knapsack, slip on your boots.
and head for Canada. I'll be right
beside you. I

Leon Uris has selected the period from the famine of the
1850's to the Easter Rising of 1916 to tell the story of
lreland in a novel delving into her past, explaining the
troubles of the present, and giving insights into what her
future may be. This Trinity consists of the Larkin family
of Ballyutogue, generations of Catholic hill farmers fight-
ing for survival against the harshness of the land and the
injustice of British rule. The Hubbles,'representing three
centuries of British aristocracy, who ventured to lreland
to conquer, colonize, and exploit. And the"MacLeods of
Belfast, a family of shipyard workers whose Scottish-
Presbyterian ancestors were planted in Ulster to secure
the Crown's interests. This is the Trinity of the Irish epic
that would never mix, their inter-relations of love and
hate in a terrible and beautiful drama spanning over half
a century. .
Leon Uris, the author of Exodus, Mila 78, and Topaz,
stands acclaimed as one of the master novelists of this
century. With his wife, photographer Jill Uris, he has
told yet another story oflreland in words and pictures—-
/reland: A Terrible Beauty.

IRELAND: A TERRIBLE BEAUTY
JILL and LEON URIS  
385 photographs, including 107 in full color.
This is the impassioned and beautiful story of Ireland as
it is today. It is full of love for the land, the towns, the
islands, and the people; it is full of sorrow for the mur-
lg derous situation in Ulster, and it is full of anger at those
1 elements——past and present—in England, in the Church
Catholic and Church Protestant, and in the North who
have brought hateful confrontation to so high a pitch.
Vi Many of the photographs show the fighting in Belfast.
and Derry, yet with a special magic Jill and Leon Uris
have also portrayed in stunning picutres and text the
castles and ancient beehive churches, the soft landscapes
and a people at work, at play, at worship. A total portrait.
Jill Uris studied photograph at Harvard, New York Uni-
versity, and Colorado College. She was born Jill Peabody
in 1947. 
33 Leon Uris is the author of 03 VI/, Exodus, Amageddon,
