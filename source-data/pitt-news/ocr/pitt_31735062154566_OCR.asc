Fraternity rushing will remain
materially as it is at -present next
fall. A joint committee, composed
of the University fraternity coun-
cil of officers and the fraternity
committee of interfraternity council
so decided last" Tuesday at the Pi
Lambda Phi house, when it rejected

"three of four major changes in-
dorsed Vby interfraternity council on
March, 26. The committee, whose
approval was necessary before the
suggested changes should go into
effect, accepted only the recom-
mendation that the rule prohibiting
contact "between rushees and , fra-

~ ternities after 9‘-~o’.clock in the*’= eve-
ning be abolished- - 3

At the same timexthe-committee
voted down the proposal for‘ rushing
in November instead of in Febru-
ary. .It then kill-ed=th'e resolution to
abolish preferential bidding through
the dean of men’s office, -together
with I-the so-called" “silence week.”
Finally it dropped the .proposed
modiﬁcation permitting freshmen to
be pledged regardless of-grades and
_requiring twelve quality points with
twelve; credits only before initiation.

5 Hill c1imbing,_ as an exercise, is
all wrong and "does more harm
than good, in the. opinion of ‘John

"Dambach, director of the 4depa"rt-

ment of" physical education, who
mourns the. fact that the. students
of the 4- University must scale steep
hills to get to their classes. ‘And

VWith the completion of  -,Ca.- 

thedral of Learning, hill ' climbing
will no longer be .necessary- for
most students, but the freshmen
who -are required to take physical

education and the‘ upper_ classmenV

who desire to use the gynr for rec-
reation. will still have--to t1re_.them-.
selves, by the ascent, .that_1s, un-

less Dambach’s dream.» of a new

recreation building-jcomes true.

‘-This new building, as Mr.-' Dam-_
bach visualizes it, will be laced
on Frick Acres near the V , athe-
dral, and will be called the “Stu-
dent Welfare Building.”

According to Dambach‘ a ‘great
need for such all recreation build-

ing will be felt as soon as the stu-
dents ' begin to use the Cathedral..

They will be conﬁned in one build-
ing almost all of the. day,‘ elevator
facilities will ‘do away with all
step climbing, and everything will
be so convenient that the only e_x-
ercise most of them. w_ill'get*w1ll
be their walk from the st_Vreet_ car
to the entrance ofthe building.“
Dambach V believes '-the proposed
recreation building should contain
several gymnasia, two ‘swimming
pools, aydozen handball courts, two
bowling alleys, a pool room, a
lounging room, doctorsﬁ oificesﬁfor
men and women, and _-offices. of the
Y. ‘M. and Y. W. C_.  All de-
partments‘ of the building would
be open to the entire student body
and to members of the‘ faculty, and

Dambach estimates‘ that 90 per’

cent of the students using the ca-
thedral would use the recreation
building. ’ '

Sufficient lockers -would be,
stalled sothat one could be as-

signed to‘ every student, and, each-

could use ‘the gymnasium, the
swimming pools, or_ any other
room at any time during the day.

HELD ASKS AID
  FORASSOCIATION

iLowl ‘Treasury May Prevent
Holding Of College ..
Informal Dance. ’

 

“Unless more students in the col-
"lege support the College Associa-
tion, and unl=ess students’ ‘loans are
forthcoming, we will not be able to
hold the spring informal ‘scheduled
for April 16,” said Omar. C. Held,
faculty advisor to the organization,
Mferfflesday afternoon. ’ _ .
 S_ince-- its: inception;-I--in -the fall of
1926,, under the*ad'visership/of John
R; Johnston, the association has
dwindled down from a membership
of 750 to less than-‘200.

That the students in the college
have not been supporting the as-
sociation was. affirmed by Mr. Held.
“Last year we had over 400 mem-
bers; this year we have, about 200.
The membership money from this
semester’s -group, subdivided into
loans and social expenses, is n-otvsuf-
ﬁcient to cover, the three affairs
‘which we o1‘.igi;nal1y,planned,’? he.
said. .

On the question’ of the loans which
the; association has made to stu-
dents, Mr. Held stated that many
loans which were to~have- been paid
back by the students by February 1,
1929, were still outstanding. A meet-
ing of the association will be held
today to discuss the financial situa-
tion.

Appointed To Draw
New Social Calendar

George Frey, Col. ’29, and
Sarah Barr, Col. ’31, have -been
appointed by Student Relations
Committee of Student Council’ to
serve with Walter Rome, gradu-
ate manager of activities, in draw-.
ing-_up-the social calendar for the
‘school year of 1929-30. The ten»
tative social‘ schedule as proposed
by this committee, must be- sub-
mitted to Student Relations Com-
mittee for ﬁnal ratiﬁcation. Work
on formulating next. year’s social
program will begin immediately
and ‘must be completed within the
next month and ahalf, announces
Mr. Rome.‘

Because of the criticisms directed
against the" -present calendar and’
the recent investigation of Student
Council into what it ,-termed “a

 

endar,” the present‘ social program
will undoubtedly be subject to con-
siderable revision for next year,
was the opinion of Rome. ’

Many Ideas Which
Enoble ‘Man

What would you say if you were
askedthe question, “What ﬁve ideas
have most enobled man?”. This
question was asked of students in
the art of living course, conducted
by Miss Thyrsa_W. Amos, dean of
women, and this’ question, too,
caused the students more worry and
consternation than any other idea
taken up by the class. .

Rather than offer ideas, many
members‘ of ‘the class presented
whole, Systems of thought, customs,
skills and instincts. T-hose which
were suggested by the ‘class as be-
ingienobling ideas were the concept
of God, cooperation, love, democ-
racy, tolerance, aim in life, study of
man himself, freedom of individual,
religionand truth.

Other enoblinggideas were sug-
gested as writing, language, scien-
tiﬁc method, scientiﬁc investigation,
economic organization, the ultimate
triumph of- good, brotherhood of
man,
loyalty. Several of the students who
leaned towards a pessimistic philos-
ophy indicated that there were‘ no
enoblingf ideas but that everything
"contributed «toward . the ignoble.

Miss. Amos ‘stated that in answer
to. the question, as a group the class
failed to agree upon ‘anyvﬁve ideas,
since our modern system of educa-
tion emphasizes the economic life.
In-' answering the question, the-« indi-
viduals were not held to their _own
opinions but were permitted to con-
‘sult anyone they so desired. In
many instances instructors were
asked to comment.

Miss Amos would answer . the
question: the desire of man to dis-
cover his maker, relationship of man
to his own kind, ‘scientific "method
of approach,‘the idea of life after
death, and communication which in-
cludes.‘ art _or the‘ transmission of
one’s experiences. ‘ ' -

By Grace D. -Ely

Art Consultant, Research Bureau

This spring there will undoubtedly

be two distinct "color trends notice- ti

able in the dress of smart co-eds on
the Pitt campus.

The_ ﬁrst and more familiar color
harmony to be carried .out by the
fashion wise_wi1l be the use of re-
lated colors. Many ensembles‘ will
be built around two‘ or more shades
of one color. For, example, the
brunettes will undoubtedly favor the
still popular combinations of brown

and beige, with perhaps a dash of.‘
orange, which belongs to the same,
color family. . .
'4 For the blonde, navy, blue, com-
bined with the lighter, brighter
blues. And for the in-between, who
is neither blonde nor brunette, the
wide range of soft and brighter
greens. The girl with auburn hair
and fair complexion is particularly
fortunate this spring as the very
-fashionable purples and yellow-
greens. are becoming to her. How-
ever,' these colors are not as prac-
tical‘ to build a whole wardrobe
around as theimore easily matched
and harmonized blues, greens and
browns. ' - -
The-. second and newer color ten-
dency shows less matching and more
contrast in the costume. This is
achieved in three ways. First,} the

contrast of two color families, such
as light navy and chartreuse in
carefully adjusted proportions. Sec-
ondly, contrast may be obtained by
going to extremes in light and dark,
ie most successful examples of
which are the popular black with
Erhite and brown with yellow out-
ts. ‘

I’ The third type of contrast is seen
Sn costumes which use a neutral
ibackground against which bright
‘-colors may be used successfully.
Black‘ with red, nasturtium -shades
or bright greens and blues illustrate
this type of contrast.

summer it will be considered smart
to have a sun-tanned complexion
has had quite an inﬂuence on the
color mode. It is now possible to
obtain ‘shoes, hose, gloves and even
jewelry in sun’-tancshades; however,
these should not be any darker than
one’s own particular tan. -

,,,In choosingvcolorful items of ap-
parel, no matter how becoming each
piece may be separately it is folly
to buy a single thing whichis not
“-becoming” to or will not harmon-

Even though elected national
president of Cwens, women’s_
sophomore honorary activities‘
fraternity, at ‘the convention of
the national organization at
Penn State college last week,
Margaret Hall, Ed. ’31, dis-
covered on her way home that
she must still obey traffic reg-
ulations. ‘

She was driving an automo-
bile ‘occupied by several Pitt
co-eds when a motor patrolman
drew up and bawled out, “Do
you know which side of the
road you are supposed to drive
-on?” After Miss Hall ex-
plained that she was not ac-
customed to driving on crowd-
ed- roads, theoificer smiled and
directed the party to the
shortest road to Pittsburgh.

But to prove that he wanted
no more foolishness he drove,
in front --of the Pitt girls for‘
approximately t h i r t y miles,
causing them to arrive at their
destination, considerably later
than they expected.. .

OLD COLD CIGARETTES, win
, ~FIR_ST iNTEsTs AT YALE

In the recent cigarette test made at ~
the University, OLD GOLDS Were‘ -
chosen by the students as the. best.

‘The lcigarelttes were masked by

black labels so that the names of
the brands were concealed. Each

label was numbered. “ This was

judged to be the most sporting way»
of. testing the merits of the four

leading brands. Some 208 Yale

students were asked to smoke ‘the.
-four disguised. brands. without
knowing their identity.

They were merely to choose, by

number, the one that was most
appealing to the taste. ’

The NEWS supervised the test
on January 18 at various fraternity
houses and in the News oﬂice.

‘ When the votes were recorded ‘
it was discovered that OLD GOLD
(Cigarette .No. 3) had won. Old ’
Gold was "given -63 ﬁrst choices,
which was 11 per cent ahead of
Cigarette No. 2, 34 per cent ahead
‘ of Cigarette No. 1, and 53 per cont .
I -ahead .°.f.<Ci83¥°“°.’.N°éV4»' .

The” primary" purpose of the

this ‘end, industrial ‘and business
leaders areinvited to address‘ the

Though this is the first year it has

Panther varsity track squad will
turn its attention to the outdoor
meets, the first of which will be
with" —Ohio-" State‘ at-' Columbus, on
April 20.

If the two indoor meets failed to."

to go to the‘ bigmeet butthey will
have to. score the majority of the
points, in the dual meets...»

Gwinn In Form
 Now that the team will‘ meet all

tracks, Don: Gwinn will have. an op-
portunity to display his wares‘. The

‘little West. Virginian is the best

hammer" thrower ever to appear in

that "goes one of the three best in
the entire country. Of the three
Panthers who will be out to set up

best-chance’, of anyofthein. He has
been training since‘. last October, and
expects to ‘have the best season of
his" career. , '

Don didn’t get many‘ first places
lastyear, butwhen the hot summer;
days. came’ along he took himself up
to vB'ost‘on and won himself a place
on Uncle Sam’s- Olympic team, and
then. in Amsterdam. he tossed the

ﬁfth place.’ Ithas been said by» many
who. saw the Panther‘ midget in ac-
tion‘ over there, that hadit not been
for the fact that the ring was. some-

would have stood. a fine "chance of
copping the Olympic title. With this
his last. year of competition, Don
ought to go over big, and if the well
wishes of his teammatesmean any--
thing he really going to town.
‘Les Cohen Reports

There will-_ be" plenty» of boys» to
help the Pitt. clan, out in the dual
meets, however. Alberts and Caesar
are two good: -distance men‘ who will
be big]; helps. Then there is Grosset
who as run‘ some mighty good
miles; but hasn't proved to be, very
consistent. Chuclc Yoigt-1 and Clar-
-ence Goodwinare. two good. hurdlers"
who should have_ good ".s'eas_'_'ons'.
Voigt especially looks‘ like" he is in
for a good year; This is his last
year ‘of varsity, competition,-and he

-is being counted on to give Knobby

and. Lewis a lot of support in the

hi-gh and low hurdles. The addition

of Des Cohen to the weight‘ squad
has added a lot of strength there.
The Uniontown boy ‘is a "good shot
putter and discus thrower, and he
and Harry Robb should come in for
their share‘ of points‘ in these two-
events. ‘ ‘ 1

" Tennis has been‘ ‘making rapid

most interesting part "of it all ~'is‘
that college players are getting

The Phi Kapps copped the
Wednesday division by defeating
the Delta Sigma. Phis 21-14’ in«a
slow game that featured Getto, Mc-
Mahon and Braddock." Sherako, the].
Phi" Kappstar center, was sick in»
his home._A Undaunted by this -hand-
icap, the Phi Kapps got together
after the end of.‘ the __ﬁrst.half and
decisively defeated A the Delta Sig

team ‘fought back until the end of

the half, -and then were completely.

shortlyafter the Phi Kapp battle.
Tuesday’ night the Theta Delta
Psis whipped the Phi Delts to win
the title of. the Friday division and
to gain entrance in the semi-ﬁnals.
The Theta Delta Psis, who have
gone through the season with sen-‘
sational victories over all their op-,
ponents, showed their true strength
against the Phi Delts, one. of the
strongest teams of . the league, as
they defeated them .22-12. The
teamwork that was displayedby
both «squads would do credit to
varsity squads. Donchess starred

for the losers but the ﬁve-man de-'
