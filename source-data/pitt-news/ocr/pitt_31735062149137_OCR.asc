22 Get Keys At Annual Banquet
On Saturday; Biddle Predicts
Show’s Financial Success

 

“Out for the Count,” the Cap and
Gown show of the year, ended with
its fourth and last performance last

Saturday night, and this morning 70-
odd show men and numerous techni-

‘cal assistants are back in classes.

Financially, “Out for the Count”
has not yet been analyzed, but judging
from the size of the audiences that
viewed the four performances, ac-
cording to Theodore VV. Biddle, grad-
uate manager of Cap and Gown, the
29th annual show has been more suc-
cessful than it has been for years

past.

At the Cap and Gown banquet,
given Saturday evening before the
ﬁnal performance of “Out for the

Count,” 22 men were awarded keys for
service either in the show or with one
of the technical staffs.

Award Gold, silver Keys

The show men who received‘ gold -

keys have spent two years in Cap
and Gown productions. They were:
J. Bernard Block, Stanley Rosenbloom,
James Thompson, Robert B. Luskin,
John P. Baker, Leo J. Cafferty, Eugene
L. Burkhart, John W. Parks, Albert
J. Barr, Joseph Madden, Thomas
Steele, and Bernard Siegal.

Silver keys were awarded to Michael
Pejnovic and Charles L. Keenoy,
seniors, for participation in this year’s
show.

Three-year service requirements for
staff positions have been completed
by eight men. Milton,Brown, Charles
Bucher, Nicholas Vellis, Wilson A.
Griffiths, O. D. Montgomery, Raymond
Scheib, Howard Schweppe, and Wil-
liam Brosius who received gold.keys
for their staff work.

According to campus comment,
credit lines are still in order for di-
rector Theodore Viehman, who made
as smooth-running a show as Cap and
Gown audiences have been, and dance
master Gene Kelly, who limbered the’
legs of the “gals” and men in the
choruses and taught them their steps.

__ ,Spanos. Saffrpn Score

Nicholas Spanosv and Robert Saffron,
accordingto «downtown critics, had
just one fault in their script—an ex-
cessive number of ideas with which
the boys ﬁlled the show. That does
not appear to be keeping congratula-
tory handshakes away, however.

Other men who have received little
mention, but who played important
parts in the production were: Robert
Kaufman, business manager, and
Raymond Scheib, his assistant; Wil-
son Griffiths, production manager, and
William Blum, assistant; property
manager, 0. D. Montgomery; costume
manager, Charles Bucher; technical
manager, Jack S. Robson; and Charles
W. Foreman who directed the make-
up.

Glee Club Quartet To,Sing
AtBredkfast Club Thursday

“Oh How I Hate To Get Up In The
Morning” won’t be on their program,
but the four lads in the Glee Club
quartet" will probably be in that mood
next Thursday morning when they ap-
pear at the Breakfast Club in the Fort
Pitt hotel at 8 o’clock as guest artists.

The foursome composed of William
Cover, tenor, Frank Engel, C38, tenor,
John Clark, C36, baritone, and Robert
Euwer, C36, bass, were invited by Dr.
John B. Sutherland, head football
coach at the University. They will
sing a group of six numbers.

School Library Moves
To Cathedral Thursday

One more step in the develop-
ment of the Cathedral appears im-
minent in the following notice from
J. Howard Dice, University Libra-
man:

The General Library in State
Hall will close at 3 o’clock Thurs-
day, April 30, in order to facilitate
the transfer of the University Li-
brary to the Cathedral.

It is expected that the new quar-
ters on the fourth, fifth_ and sixth
floors of the Cathedral will be open
for use commencing 9 o’clock Mon-
day, May 4th.

We regret that it. is necessary to
close the Library, and hope that
it will not cause great inconve-
nience to students and faculty
members.

 

New Men’s Group
Meets Tomorrow

Council To Elect Officers; 13 Men
Will Inaugurate New Group

 

 

The Men’s Council will meet for the
ﬁrst time tomorrow afternoon. At -this
meeting, called for Room 801, Cathe-
dral, at 3:45 o’clock, the newly elect-
ed group will select officers for the
coming two semesters.

Composed of 13 student members
and a representative from the office
of the dean of men, the Council will
have charge of “all activities pertain-
ing strictly and particularly to men.”
Represented proportionally are the
College with six members, the School
of Business Administration with
three, the School of Engineering with
two, and the Schools of Education and
Mines, withone each. --

The new organization, according to
its constitution as approved by SFA six

weeks ago, is in pa.rt~self—perpetuat-'

ing, since certain of its sophomore and
juniormembers may bereelected by
internal election. Included among its
more important activities will be the
regulation of men’s customs and the
supervision of intramural athletics.
Political. Lineup Hazy

Political lineups in Men’s Council
hazy, but certain, authorities report a
comfortable majority of 8 to 5 held
by the Beta-Independent coalition.
Conﬂicting statements make this lit-
tle more than an intelligent guess.
Although ten men were nominated for
both Men’s Council and SFA, only
Alex Leggin was successful in being
elected to positions on both organiza-
tions, and of the other nine, only three
were elected to SFA.

Those members who were elected
and who will meet for the ﬁrst time
tomorrow include Leggin,__ Charles
Rogers, ’37, Robert Prince, ’38, Paul
Jennings. ’38, Willia.m Hoeveler, ’39,
and Leo G. ‘Griffith, '39, from the Col-

‘lege; Elmer"Schriber, ’37, John Glass-

er, ’38, and Robert Dannies, ’39, from
the School of Business Administra-
tion; Florian Ma.jchrzak, ’37, and
Charles Thatcher, ’38, from the School
of Engineering; Chalmers Brown, ’37,
from the School of Education; and

Weather Brings Budd Roads,

Diefendorfs

Paper Explains

 

Easter drivers have remarked with
some degree of alarm that the condi-
tions of the highways leading in and
out of Pittsburgh are particularly
poor. Broken axles, cracked gasoline
tanks, and crippled chassis have been
the toll taken by Old Man Winter in
his recent siege on the roads.

Adelbert Diefendorf, associate pro-
fessor of civil engineering, has writ-
ten a paper which attempts to explain
the road conditions. Flood and snow,
Mr. Diefendorf concludes were re-
snonsible, but the ﬂood in particular.
“Water,” Mr. Diefendorf claims,
“either liquid or frozen. and traffic
wear coupled with the impact of heavy
vehicles are the major enemies of the
highway engineer.”

The water. it seems. managed to
seep through the road surfaces.
Even the most satisfactory surfacing
jobs were taxed by the water that
roared six and seven feet above the
highway. If you drove east last week
you must have noticed the broken tele-
phone poles, their wires beaded with
dea.d leaves.

The paper presents the problem:
“first. we need a structurally sound
foundation support or subgrade, and.
second, a satisfactory surface rigid
enough to support traffic and resilient
enough to absorb vehicle impact. At
the same time, it should develop no
holes or cracks to admit water. It
would soften the subgrade or freeze
and expand, thus doing further dam-
age to support and surface.”

Pittsburgh’s streets are construct-

ed with the latest engineering methods
and best materials, Mr. Diefendorf as-
sures us. But he adds “like anything
else. these materials are perishable
and despite any story to the contrary
are not permanent unless given ordi-
nary maintenance.” The author con-
cludes that a budget must be set
aside for that maintenance if we are
to be assured of constantly condition-
ed roads.

He continues with a technical dis-
cussion on the ways and means of
road building, pointing out the three
types of municipal pavements. One
type, termed rigid, has been little
used in Pittsburgh but the Boulevard
of the Allies is of that construction
and has withstood admirably the win-
ter seasons of two years.

Then he answers the question of
Fifth Avenue and Forbes Street driv-
ers, “VVhy the tire-catching ruts be-
side the street car tracks?” The trol-
ley tracks, it seems, are laid on wood
ties 011 a stone ballast. Concrete ﬁller
is placed between the rails with block
or asphalt laid between tracks. Be-
cause the tracks a.re built on a sep-
arate foundation, the pavement ad-
jacent to them suffers when water
seeps in. The solution is iii a united
track and pavement arrangement,
Diefendorf asserts, ‘

The paper ends with the expressed
hope that ﬁnancial support will be
given the proposed paving problems.
“Thus," the-professor believes, “our
streets will be-. returned to their once
normal condition.”

Plans Announced
- For 12th Poetry
Reading Contest

The twelfth annual poetry reading:
contest to be held at the University.’
will start this year with preliminaries,_;
open to all students, on May 4 and:
5 at 2:30 o’clock in Room 220, Alum-
ni Hall. The winner of ‘the contest,=
first started by Dr. W. M. Parrish,
professor of public speaking, receiv-_;
es a copy of the “Oxford Book of Eng-
lish Verse” from Percival Hunt, head
of the department of English.

An innovation this year is the re-‘

quirement that contestants shalli
limit themselves to poetry written»
since 1890. Poetry selected should be;

about 40 or 50 lines, and may be from;
any representative modern American
or English poet. ’

Members of the public speaking de-
partment will judge the preliminaries,"
and select ﬁve or six students to com-
pete in the ﬁnals, to be judged by
members of the English department.

Last year Marquis Patterson won
the contest with his reading of Brown-
ing’s “Up At A Villa_ Down In The
City.” . ‘

Advanced Corps
Plans To Encamp

Fort Monroe Will Be ‘Summer
Home’ Of 67 University Men

Sixty-seven members of the Coast
Artillery Unit of the advanced ROTC
corps have been ordered b-y the mili-
tary department to attend camp at
Fort Monroe, Va., this summer.

When camp opens on June 12 all of
the senior and junior members of the
University ROTC corps‘ are‘ expected

‘camped with the ROTC members from
the University will be units from Mass-
achusetts Institute of Technology,
Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Univer-
sity of New Hampshire, University of
Delaware, and Fordham University.‘
These units will be required to remain
in camp until July 23, when camp will
be broken.» ‘

This will be‘ the seventeenth season’
that the University will be represent-
ed at Camp Fort Monroe, It was in
1920 that the ﬁrst delegation of Uni-
versity students was sent there.

All the expenses incurred by the
students, including passage to and
from camp, are defrayed by the United
States government. In addition each
attending member of -the corps re-
ceives a daily sa.lary of 70 cents.

At camp the corps will put into
practical application the theoretical
knowledge received at the University.
They will work with various types of
artillery used in coastal defense aside
from receiving instruction in infantry
maneuvers.

The advanced students to be present
at Camp Monroe will be: F. T. Adams,
J. E. Arthur, H. S. Auld, B. E. Babcock,

Band To Present  
Classics, Novelty
Wednesday Night

Goldman, Noted Leader, To Head
ROTC Group’s Annual Concert
At Carnegie Music Hall

In thepast season, University stu-
dents a.nd faculty have been able to
see the University ROTC Band per-
forming complicated maneuvers on
the football ﬁeld. They may also have
basked a triﬂe in the reputation the
band established at the For-dham game
when New York sport writers gave as
much publicity to the musical organi-
zation as they did to Dr, Sutherland’s
boys. Next Vvednesday evening at
Carnege Music Hall, the band again
steps into the limelight, this time as
a well trained musical unit led by Lee
M. Lockhart, director of instrumental
music at the University, '

For its guest artist of the evening,
the band will present Dr. Edwin
Franko Goldman, composer, lecturer,
and conductor of the famous Goldman
Band. In .addit'on to leading some

- special arrangements of several of his

own compositions, Dr. Goldman will
conduct the band in numbers by other
composers.

It is the aim of the band to present
a concert that will appeal to all per-
sons. In view of this fact, the program
l1as been arranged into three sections:
classical, theatrical, and campus works
and songs. Rossini‘s “Overture to VVil-
lfam Tell,” will appeal to all those
who like complicated part arrangement
and technical difficulties in their mu-
sic; Stephen C. F0ster’s songs are pop-
ular wherever they are heard; and for
those who hold that compositions on
the order of “A1exander’s Rag Time
Band” are the epitome of musical
achievement, the band has prepared
clever arrangements to some of the
University songs.

Tuba Section Features

Then, there are to be specialty num-
bers. In one of these, the tuba sec-
tion will have a chance to struggle
with a devilish compound of runs and
low notes known as “Pomposa." It is
expected that the saxophone sextet
and the trombone quartet will offer
several selections. The arrangement
of the Foster songs calls for dancers,

’-to be supplied by the department of

physical education in the University,
and a harp accomp-animent, to be play-
ed in this case by Miss lRuth Boyer.

The management of the band is in
the hands of student leaders. Adolph
Kahl, C36, drum major and cadet cap-
ta‘n; George Gehres, C36, assistant
director; William Jarratt, BA37, as-
sistant drum major: and James Ear-
hart, C36, student director. Stephen
Tracey is drum coach, a.nd Roberta
Nern. C36, is coed captain. '

Tickets for the concert may still be
secured at the office of the military
department, Room 1101, Cathedral.
They will be exchanged in return for
the proper token in the student activ-
ities book. After Wednesday after-
noon, the tickets will be on sale to the
general public at the Carnegie Hall
box office.

Lederer, Dean At New Schooi, '
Says U. S. Dictator Unlikely

 

By Chester Harris

Concluding a two-day stayin Pitts-
burgh in which he found time to ad-
dress meetings of the Economic Club,
American Statistical Society and Dr.
Francis D. Tyson’s class in Contem-
D01‘&1‘Y Economic Theory, Dr. Emil

EL-ederer, dean of the Graduate Facu.l--

ty of Social Science of the new School
of Social Research in New York,
agreed to answer several questions
dealing with the current political sit-
uation in Europe.

Beginning with Germany, he describ-
ed what he thought were the only two
courses open to the country. First
war, in which he believes Germany
may ultimately be conquered. Second,
to be let alone on her present policy
until such a time as she will gradually
expand by swallowing some of the
other central European nations, such
as Austria, and then forcing her will
on the other dominant powers of Eu-
rope to acquire possessions in other
parts of the world.

This, he pointed out, answers the
proponents of the statement that "Ger-
many is seeking war. “No nation wants
war,” he stated, “that can gain its
particular Wants by other means.”

“But,” he added, “there is in Ger-
many a class peculiar to that country
who might be termed ‘professional
soldiers.’ ” To explain this term still
further, Dr. lLederer alluded to a (1110-
tation by the writer Volkmannwho
described the class as thinking.
“Death on the battleﬁeld is the fulﬁll-

ment of every man.”

These men, he said, want war, but
he remarked that they were in his
opinion restricted to Germany and not
in evidence in- such -countries as
France and England.

Dr. Lederer discounted the query as
-to whether Germany was still behind
Adolph Hitler and his Nazi program
by pointing out that the German peo-
ple have no choice in the matter.
“The program is simply suggested to
them, he said. “and they are raised
from childhood to believe in it.”

" Referring again to the German ex-
pansion policy, he stated that the Ger-
man position might be still further
enhanced by a treaty with Italy which
was not at all unlikely.

Italy, he believes, will remain aloof
until she ﬁnds “which way the vic-
tory is going” before throwing in her
lot with any nation. This was her
policy in the World War.

He also discounted the recent un-
derstanding between Italy and France.
- Soviet Russia,’ Dr. Lederer believes,
due to her isolation can never rival
Germany if Germany becomes the
dominant power, of Europe. In addi-
tion he seemed impressed by the un-
derstandings between Germany and
Japan, holding that these would also
be a check on Russia.

He described as "unlikely” that a
dictator would be set up in either
"France or England and even more’ so_
in the United States. Yet he was

Encores Are In Order
' TUDENT-WRITTEN CAP AND GOWN shows should
be here to stay.

Those who saw the 29th annual production of the Cap
and Gown Club last week will vouch that the show Was
worth hanging from the Nixon's chandeliers to see. And
that, by the way, is what additional patrons might ha.ve
had to do, judging by the size of the audiences which
turned out for the play.

Nothing better has been done bY Cal) and GOWI1 Since
anyone wants to remember. Trite and dull themes of
the past seemed pitiful in comparison t0 the I'011iCkiI1g
action of the Nicholas Spanos-Robert Saﬂron piece. Ad-
mittedly there were spots where the show slowed down
to a walk, but in all three acts there was less drag
man that which is generally accredited to a campus
politician. .

The success the show enJ'0Yed should serve only to
give impetus to student authors, who in the past have
met disappointments with monotonous regularity. Now
is the time to start work for next year and the more
boys who take up the torch the better possibilities the
show will have. A

With the great start that has been made regarding stu-
dent-written script potentialities, all that remains to be
done is to swing a new deal in regard to music for the
show. We're conﬁdent that the collegiate tunesmiths
have a lot of songs buzzing around in their heads that
could have surpassed some of this year's music even if
played on an organ grinder.

Plaudits galore are due to Directors Ted Viehman and
Gene Kelly along with every member of cast, chorus
All they need is something to
work with.

Typewriter stocks should hit a new high this summer.

1* - Another Point On Peace

" ITTLE REPERCUSSIONS are still bumping around
in regard to last VVednesday’s Peace Assembly here.
'Some students have taken stock of the whole business

and candidly insist that out of all the speech-making of

‘that hour they received not one constructive idea point-
ing toward the achievemnt of a lasting peace.

That attitude may be just :1 triﬂe harsh. True, no one
stepped forth that day with sharp, concise, and fool-proof-
guaranteed plans which led the children of the Univer-
sity out of the Commons Room shouting: “Eureka! I
have found it!” But it does not seem that the speakers
that morning were merely disturbing air currents in the
Commons Room.

The speakers seemed to smack one nail on the head
pretty consistently, that being the business of placing
war at the doorstep of capitalist proﬁt-seekers who de-
light in lending money and selling supplies to belliger-
ents. ’And the student speaker, who stuck to his guns—-
or, it might be more appropriate to say, his subject—
more than the others, presented remarkably well his
case there is no going around the mountain in this
business, rather we must go right 011 through.

Maybe There's Something Else

Undoubtedly ideas were there, comment to the con-
trary notwithstanding. But an idea, coming from a fel-
low who says he sat up front and took an hour's look
at the gathering. suggests another point. This fellow
looked around, he says, and tried to decide just how
many in that audience would, if he were in trouble,
peel off their coat and pitch in to help him. His sur-
mising amounted to the result that a great majority of
those assembled would, if they found him down, be just
as glad to step on his face.

No matter what the worth of that fellow's thought, it
does bring up a point which might bear an airing. In-
asmuch as the hope for permanent peace. seems to be
built upon individuals_ it might not be a bad idea to
turn a few thoughts to the individuals.

If by some development, individuals could live with
those about them in closer harmony, with respect and
kindness for the other fellow no matter what his view-
point or ideas or creed, then there would perhaps be a
better chance to achieve that feeling among nations.

Likewise, those individuals could be led to realize
that before their lungs are eaten out in some muddy
‘ditch during a next war they will likely have had a
hand in ripping off someone’s head on the other side.
If everyone could instill in himself, rather than the
horror of having his own legs shot off, the conviction
that he will have no part of dealing death and destruc-
tion to others_ he might have a ﬁrmer platform to stand
on when the passionate war bugs begin to shout,
“Coward.”

The Pitt News

F our-Night Stand Completed,

Word Of Welcome

E HAVE WITH US today and hereafter the host of

Pitt sons and daughters who have been attending
Downtown Division classes and the University's School
of Law. Any move to bring separated branches of the
University under the wing of a central location is a
good thing, and the additional facilities aiforded by the
campus here should prove a boon to the newcomers.

It won't be too much of a change for these students
who have been doing their work downtown. Going to
class in elevators won't be anything new to them, and
virtually the only thing they'll miss will be the drug
store downstairs.

For a. time, the future lawyers may have some little
diﬁiculty in separating base hits from case books when
they take a look out of the window once in a while, but
then the Pirates don't play ball every day. There are
some, in fact, who maintain that the Pirates don't play
ball at all.

Whatever may be the nature of necessary adjustments
which these students will have to make, it’s up to the
original campus folks to help out in any way possible.

The Pitt News extends a hearty welcome to the new-
comers here and hopes that their being in the vicinity
will be an inﬂux to news that it may carry regarding
them and their organizations.

Prominent Actress Gives
Library Two Italian Books

Ruth Draper, the dramatic artist who appeared at the
Nixon recently, has presented the University Library
with two books_ “Icaro” and “The Story of My Death,”
wi-th the following letter of explanation:

“I am venturing to send you these two books in the
hope that you will place them on the tables of the Col-
lege Library.

“Five years ago “Laura de Bosis, the author of ‘Icaro’
and ‘The Story of My Death,’ conceived and carried out
a plan to arouse hlS countrymen to the dangers of
Fascism, to awaken their social conscience to the princi-
D188 and traditions of liberalism, and to the need of sav-
ing it from extinction.

“Lauro de Bosis was an idealist, who with a great love
of life, risked death for his -ideal. He has left a message
not only to his countrymen but to all youth, and it is
my hope that in this translation of his play and in the
forceful document which explains the purpose of his act,
young men may read his message.

“These books have a peculiar signiﬁcance at this time.
For in the cdnfused issues and conflicts of the day there
is still to be found inspiration and a stiffening of moral
sinews in the example of a young man who followed his
convictions to the end.” '

Lauro de Bosis was born in 1901. The son of a dis-
tinguished Italian poet, he was graduated from the Uni-
versity of Rome in 1922, and in the years that followed
he undertook to translate i-nto Italian several Greek plays
as well as Fra.zier’s “The Golden Bough.” Between 1924
and 1930 he taught literature and philosophy at Harvard
University.

At the beginning of the Fascist movement in Italy
Lauro de Bosis had ardently supported it_ but after-- a
while he came to regard it as dangerous. As 3. result
of his change in belief, he organized the Alleanza Na-
zionale to ﬁght Fascism.

“The Story of My Death,” telling of the author’s anti-
Fascist campaign, was written in 1931. Bosis gave the
manuscript to a journalist friend in Marseilles just be-
fore setting out by airplane to Rome, where he dropped
thousands of pamphlets. After ﬂying over the city for
a half hour, his plane headed back toward Marseilles and
was never seen again. It is believed that he fell into
the sea, either from an attack by Italian planes or for
lack of fuel.

The poetic drama, “‘Icaro,” was written in 1927 and
was given the Olympic prize for poetry at Amsterdam in
the same year. The present volume contains both the
original Italian text and the translation by Miss Draper.

In his preface to the book, Gilbert Murray, of Oxford

University, has written:
_ “It belongs to the high Italian tradition, and seems
lll many ways to constitute almost a deﬁance of present-
day fashions in poetry. It rejoices in a severe class-
icism of form; it takes an old Greek myth for its ground-
work; and in the manner of Attic tragedians it uses the
myth as a vehicle for great living ideas.

O. K._ Oklahoma!

lVhen asked what she would rather be, one University
of Oklahoma coed said she preferred Eve, not because
she didn’t have to wear clothes, but because whatever
she wore was i11 style.

“In Memoriam” In War, Too
At the University of California at Berkeley plans

were made for a peace demonstration to be held on the

campus at 11 o’clock, April 22 but 24 hours before then,

the executive committee of the school withdrew their

support. The next clay the daily paper carried a little

box “in Memoriam” of the demonstration against war.

Dinner For Two, Please Gals

Sixteen coeds at the University of Oregon, armed with
beauty and a basket containing supper for two, will be
auctioned off to the highest bidders. It is only for the
evening tl1ou§:;l1. The girls will accompany those who
buy them to a dance to be held at the school soon.

The Power Of The Press

An editorial appeared in the paper of the University
of California at Berkeley 21 day before Berkele_v"s annual
open house in which the “city manager” for the day de-
clared that all tickets for parking would be “ﬁxed.” But
hard-l1ea1'ted officers refused to recognize the power of
the press and issued tickets that were supported by the
courts and the city of Berkeley collected $40.

Carl Knight, freshman at Texas Technological col-
lege is "'raising" his way through school.

An uncle gave him $15 for Christmas in 1929. Carl
bought a pllg. He raised the pig; she had a family of
six, He sold five; the remaining two presented him
with 10 more.

He sold his pigs and bought a registered cow and
calf. He accumulated a herd of 16 registered cattle,
sold two for $200 and enrolled in college. The other
14 he values at more than $1,000_ and he thinks the
calves will put him through school.

Alphas Betas There, Also
The committee for the interfraternity ball at Columbia
split over the question of whether to have a grand march
or not.

 

Cheaper To Pay
Grove City College has signed Tommy Tucker to
play for their May Dance on May 9.

A Suggestion, Ebert

The committee for the Junior Prom at Duquesne has
worked up a new publicity stunt. It is running a contest
in the “Duke" called Prompuzz. It is a series of eight
scramblegrams which with the letters properly arranged
spell the name of a member of the committee. The stu-
dent who ﬁrst turns in the full set of names properly
unscrambled to the Prom chairman will receive a free
ticket to the dance.

Veterans Etiquette
The local post of the Veterans of Future Wars at
the University of California at Los Angeles has been
named Emily Post.
Budgeted Dance Time
The WSGA at Purdue made some rules for the women
to observe during the weekend of the Coed Prom. Some
of the points covered were that all women must return
to their houses one hour after the dance closed and men
must leave at once unless there is :1 chaperoned break-
fast, in which case the men may remain one hour longer.

Cap, Gown

"Places. ﬁrst act!”

“Where's a safety pin? The hair on
my chest is showing!”

“Who stole my brassiere?"

Amid such excitement and hurry,
we thread our way through hordes of
managers for the last performance of
“Out for the Count.” One of the chorus
boys canvasses everyone, begging
each to give his all because his par-
ents are in the audience tonight,

Ho hum. After three nights, every-
one acts bored—except those in the
“Red, Vvhite, and Blue” number. This
is their last chance to get the dance
right.

Someone comes backstage. trying
to sell us a ticket, half price. We make
him get in line, along with about 12
others.

With a last warning, “Keep your
feet together, girls," Gene Kelly
leaves us to bite his nails nonchalant-
ly as the curtain follows the asbestos
up into the rafters.

As soon as we slide off set, every-
one runs for the elevator. “Manager,
manager, help me into this dress, my
girdle’s slipping.”

In the ﬁnale of the ﬁrst act even
ﬁve managers and Mr. Viehman
march in the parade, carrying signs
lettered: “Investigate Mae West,”
“Jean Harlow for Chaperone,” “Get a
Good Team, Tech.”

Index Continues
To Reﬂect Gains

Rapid Rise In Steel Mill Activity
Accounts For New High Mark

 

Continuing to gain, industrial pro-

duction for the week ended April 18
boosted the index of general business
activity in the Pittsburgh district to
a new high level for the recovery
period, according to the Bureau of
Business Research, The index increas-
ed from 83.8 in the week ended April
11, to 85.4 in the week ended April 18.

Nearly all the gain in the index re-
sulted from the pronounced rise in
-steel mill activity. The operating ra.te
of the steel industry in the Pittsburgh
district reached appoximately 65 per
cent of capacity. This rate means
that the industry was working at
about 86 per cent of normal for the
week.

In the week ended April 20 last
yeargthe industry was operating at
less than 55 per cent of normal, while
in the week ended April 15, 1933, it
was operating at approximately 25
per cent of normal.

A continued demand for nearly all
kinds of iron and steel products is
given by the Bureau as the reason for
the increase in the industry.

In addition to industrial production,
the total volume of originating freight
shipment increased appreciably. This
holds despite the fact that freight car-
loadings declined somewhat because
of a decided drop in the loadings of
coa.l.

A gain in river shipments, how-
ever, more than offset the decrease in
rail traffic.

Of additional interest in this in-
dex, is the fact that total shipments
in the district were nearly 50 per
cent greater for this week than in the
same week for 1935.

The more than seasonal decline in
electric power sales and coal produc-
tion was believed due to the lessened
demand which resulted from the re-
cent warm weather.

Volume of trade was practically un-
changed; department store sales de-
cl'ned decidedly after Easter.

Panther Netters, Golfers Top Grov_e___ City

Tee For Two

O’LoughIin’s Net Squad
Trounces Grovers,
8-1, In Opener

While a teeth-chattering group of
spectators (including a mascot, a
small freckled boy, ‘ Coach David

O'Loughlin, Manager Gene Cohen, and
:a few other people) roamed up and
down the Stadium ﬁeld Friday from
«one court to the other, the Pitt var-
sity tennis team opened its season
‘by taking over the Grove City Col-
lege netters, 8 to 1.

Interest was centered ﬁrst on those
two pals of the court, Champ Bob Mad-
den and Ralph Bald, the “Mount Leb-
anon Cannonbald.” Madden, although
starting out slow and losing the first
game of the ﬁrst set, soon rotfzd his
touch and whipped balls across the
net in long, hard drives and zipping
serves that disrupted the defense of
Larry Faibre, Grove City ace. The
two sets ended in a score of 6-1, 6-1.

Meanwhile, Bald, number one man
on the freshman team last year,
whizzed through his ﬁrst varsity en-
counter and defeated Jim Moorhead
by a 6-1, 6-2 margin. Balds “kills”
found the corners as Moorhead gradu-
ally weakened under the hard drives.

Next up, were Grove City's basket-
ball star, Johnny Chatham, and Roy
Heckler of Pitt. “Heck” took two slow-
action sets, 6-1, 6-0, by Heck!

Solow Shows Form

Another freshman star of last year,
irvin Solow, exchanged volleys with
Stanley Peterson and showed excel-
lent form in his intial varsity match.
The score was 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.

Bob Bingham, Grove City, defeat-
ed Tom Locke, Pitt, 6-3, 6-0 to score
the only Grove City tallyof the after-
noon.

Captain Joe Madden, displaying
steadiness in his driving game, took
over Jim McMillen 6-0, 6-4. This
match completed the singles play.

Funsters Bald and Bob Madden, be-
tween much cheerful heckling of each
other, nonchalantly disposed of Moor-
head and Fibre 6-0, 6-4 in the ﬁrst dou-
bles match. Funsters Heckler and
Joe Madden whipped out a 7-5, 6-2, vic-
tory over Chatham and Peterson, be-
cause Madden was hungry. And the
final match of the day was a closely
contested battle between the Solow-
John Mogan Pitt combination and
Bingham and Diehl of Grove City. The
score was 2-6, 6-2, 10-8. 1

Regular tennis pratice for the var-
sity and freshman teams will begin
today on the Stadium courts.

‘Irish Jinx’ Faces
Pitt Track Team

Frosh Tackle Altoona Wednesday;
J ayvee Schedule Announced

 

Coach Nicholson's high—riding Ramb-
lers blow in from the mid-west to con-
tribute to the general Spring Festival
celebration and take another crack at
Coach Olson’s squad on the Stadium
track Saturday.

Notre Dame will be the top-heavy
favorite to repeat a decisive victory
scored over the Pitt crew in the Cen-
tral Intercollegiates at the South Bend
ﬁeld house early in the indoor cam-
paign. The Irish team shows power
in virtually every event, and has
practically the same gang that took
the measure of the Panthers last year.

‘Three meets have been carded for
the Pitt jayvees, according to Head
Coach Olson. Jack Pfaff has been ap-
pointed student coach of the squad
that meets Slippery Rock, Grove City,
and Bethany on successive Saturdays.
Every dual clash involves a short trip-,
with Slippery Rock scheduled for the
opener on May 6.

Grove City Comes Next

On the following Saturday, Grove
City's varsity campaigners offer stiff
competition to the junior varsity.
Then one week later, May 18, the Jay-
vees ﬁnish the season against the
Bethany varsity.

Coach Pott‘s squad, with a victory
over Erie Academy to its credit,
makes its second start Wednesday at
Altoona where the crack Altoona High
trackmen promise to make things in-
teresting.

Penn State’s Cubs drop in on May 9
along with the varsity Lions to share
half of the spotlight on that day in a
double feature, marked by the con-
clusion of the spring training drills
with the annual alumni-varsity grid
classic.

On May 16, the Panther Cubs trade
shots with the little Mountaineers on
the West Virginia track in the sea-
son’s ﬁnale.

Yearling Track Squad Strong

The Pitt yearling squad is reputed
to stack up to the old high standards
of freshman teams. Charley Parsons,
hurdler, sprinter, jumper, weight man,
and just about two events short of a
whole track team, shapes up as one
of the best all-around prospects in his-
tory. He may develop into a ﬁrst-rate
decathlon performer before winding
up his collegiate competi_tion_

Chuck Poole is one of the fastest
“new” men in the country at 50 yards,
combining a lightning start with tre-
mendous leg drive. Ken Ryden and
Poole both can step the low hurdles
in excellent time. Ryden looked like a
“comer” in the high-hurdle event.

John VV00dI‘I1ff in the middle-dis-
tance hold a national scholastic rec-
ord in the mile, and has several state
titles to his credit. His long-striding
steps carry him over the “quarter”
distance in the low 50's.

Dr. Lowy In Cincinnati

 

Dr. Alexander Lowy, Professor of
Organic Chemistry, left Tuesday eve-
ing for Cincinnati, Ohio, to attend the
convention of the Electrochemical So-
ciety. Dr. Lowy is vice president of
the Society and Chairman of the Pub-
lications Committee. '

in

Bob Mease. left, and Sam Musico, right, are two of the mainstays on the
crack Panther links team. Musico, varsity letterman for two years in track
and cross-country, makes his first and final appearance for the Golfers this
year. Mease, also a senior, played No. 6 man on the 1935 outfit.

Gala Track, Field Program Arranged
For Spring Carnival Meet Thursday

 

High athletic point of Spring Festi-
val week will be reached Thursday,
April 30, when the annual Track and
ﬁeld meet send a cavalcade of jersey-
ed athletes down the lanes of the Sta-
dium track for the opening pistol
shot at 3 o’clock.

In the words of Martin J. Feely, di-
rector of Intramural athletics, and
Milton Margolis, chairman of the
Spring Festival track meet commit-
tee,. the events are open to everyone.
Both fraternity men and unattached
entries will compete. This means that
the bronze, silver, and gold awards
that go to the winners will go to
either Greek men or those with no
affiliations.

Fraternity trophies will be given to
the chapter that scores the highest.
Points for winners will be distributed
in the 5-3-1 manner. Only restrictions
on the entries are the taboo on var-
sity competitors and the fact that one
man will be limited to entrance in
four events, whch leaves plenty of
leeway.

Eleven events will ﬁll the after-
noon’s program. A relay race, 100-
yard dash, 440-yard dash,\ 220-yard
dash, three-legged race, high jump,

Linksmen Score Second
Consecutive Victory
By 9-0 Count

Shooting near-par golf, Pitt's crack
golf sextet came through with its sec-
ond whitewash victory of the week,
taking Grove City into camp by a 9-0
margin on Friday at the Alcoma
course.

Pat Symonds, No. 1 player, led his
teammates for medal honors, crack-
ing out a 75 score, three over the con-
ventional ﬁgures. Symonds won his
match from George Henderson, Grove
City star, 3 and 2.

Varsity end Frank Souchak had his
drives working in ﬁne fashion despite
the breeze to bag a 36-40-7-6 and van-
quish Charles Jenks. 5 and 4. Sou-
chak and Symonds, paired in the best
ball play, scored a 5 and 4 victory over
Henderson and Jenks.

With a brilliant comeback on the
home nine after a poor start, B6b
Mease shot a 78’ to wallop decisively
Brunton by a 6 and 5 margin. Mease
went out in 42 but netted a par 36 on
the in-nine.

Jack Wasco with a medal of 79
scored the most decisive triumph of
the afternoon with a 7 and 6 margin
over Firm of Grove City.

Other single matches found Bob
Baughman beating Swaney, 4 and 2.
and Sam Musico taking over Cross, 3
and 1.

Wasco and Musico Win

In the four-ball competition, Wasco
and Musico teamed to beat Firm and
C_ross, 6 and 5, and Mease and"'Baugh-

Panther freshmen, with only one
regular in the fold, took a shellacking
from Turtle Creek high’s niblick-wield-
ers in their opening match of the sea-
son. The score was 4-1.

Bonaroti, No. 1 ace, scored a medal
of 76 but lost to Nonnenberg who
chipped and putted to a 75 score.

At no time did any of the Panthers
trail their opponents. each of the six
being up on their Grove City rivals at
the end of nine holes.

This marked the second victory of
the season for Coach Snyder’s Pitt
lads, having swamped Tech earlier in
the week. The showing in last week’s
matches indicates that Pitt will make
a strong bid for the Eastern Intercol-
legiate Conference crown. Play in
that league starts next Friday.

Pitt Team Gets Fourth
In Penn Relays Event

 

It was not the fault of Art Thomas,
Dick Mason, and Ed Spitz that the
Panther sprint-medley relay team did
no better than fourth Friday afternoon
in the Penn Relays at Franklin Field,
Philadelphia, for on the last leg
Charley Groat took the baton with a
lead over Charley Beetham of Ohio
State, Gene Venzke of Penn, and sev-
eral other crack half-milers.

However Reetham and Venzke were
just a bit too speedy for the Pitt
anchor man, and as a result, the
Panthers lost their early lead as Ohio
State missed the carnival record. by
four seconds. New York U. placed
third, ahead of Pitt.

Jim Fassinger scored a ﬁfth in the
discus throw with a toss of 131 feet,

quarter-mile relay team failed to qual-
ify for the ﬁnals, placing fourth in the
ﬁrst heat.

Postponed To May 7, 8

Postponements have been the key-

note of school activities during the
last month. Although the cause can-
not be traced to the ﬂood. Leaders
Institute will also come under the list
of postponed activities.
_ The Institute, originally scheduled
for last,Thursday and Friday, has
been pushed back to Thursday and
Friday, May 7 and 8. The additional
two weeks will give organization ex-
ecutive committees an opportunity to
select committee chairmen judiciously
rather than in a hurried, hit—or-miss
fashion.

The 14-day grace will also give
Mary Frances Brice, Ed36, and her
committee, which is in charge of the
affair, an opportunity to make more
detailed arrangements. ‘

Polish University
Sends Greetings
With Philospher

Greetings were brought to the Uni-
versity from one of the oldest Euro-
pean schools on Friday afternoon,
when Dr. Andrew Krzesinski, profes-
-sor of philosophy at the Jagellonian
University of Cracow, Poland, spoke
before a group of students and faculty
members.

At the informal tea which was held
in the Nationality Room, 1309 Cathe-
dral, under the sponsorship of the de-
partment of philosophy, Dr. Krzesin-
ski spoke on “The Tragic State of
Modern Materialistic Culture.”

Dr. Krzesinski has been in Amer-
ica. since February of this year,
studying its religious, social, eco-
nomic, and cultural phases. At the
end of June, he will leave for Japan,
China, India, and Tibet in order to
sound the status of culture of these
gountries. Afterwards, Dr. Krzesinski
will write a book on the culture of the
East and West.

In an informal discussion after the
regular speech, Dr. Krzesinski ex-
pressed his opinion on American col-
lege students. The desire ‘to have
high spiritual culture was one of the
qualities of the American student that
impressed the lecturer most.

Dr. Krzesinski was astonished at
the tempo of American life, and stated
that the Americans were a ﬁne group
of people.

As for our own University, the
Polish teacher marvels at the height
of the Cathedral. In Poland, the tall-
est building is only 18 ﬂoors high.

 

Russian Group Plans
To Finish Room Soon

In all probability the Russian Room
will be the ﬁrst of the nationality
rooms to be built. Plans are now un-
der way for its erection on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor near the Belleﬁeld Avenue en-
trance. With the exception of the
bench and chest, the furniture for the
[Russian Room is ﬁnished and has been
in use for several years.

Just recently, the University re-
ceived the carved oak frame for the
vishivka in the Russian Room. The
vishivka is an applique embroidery
portraying St. George and the Dragon.

The frame is decorated with orna-
mentsthat are peculiarly characteris-
tic of. the CarpathoJRussian art. It
is told that 1,000 years ago a group of
Russians migrated from the Russian
Plains to the Danubian Plains. In the
ninth century the Hungarians came
and drove the Russians to the Carpath-
sian Mountain valleys. And it is the
peasant art of this group of people
that the frame is decorated with.

Mr. Jan Luhowiah, talented Russian
word carver, did the work on the oak
frame.

Eek Ladies Turn Stylists,
Interpret Nursery Rhymes

 
 

 

Greek ladies of the campus frater-
nity world are having Mother Goose
trouble these last few days. They are
all trying to get a ﬂoat ready for Fri-
day’s parade.

This year, each house has a Mother
Goose rhyme to develop into a ﬂoat
for the competition, consequently the
animal, ﬂower, bird makers‘, the car-
penters, and costumers of the frater-
nity world are busy with their tools
again executing-the brain children
the sisters have thought out.

This latest scissor grind started not
even one week after the -interfrater-
nity sing, when each fraternity had
to have an original skit.

The Kappas came home from the
sing with a nice shiny cup for their
mantel. They gave a melodrama
called “What happened to Bluebeard
in Panhellenic.” Theyhad ladies in
medieval dress, representing various
fraternities, each one being married,

was a little Alpha Epsilon Phi puppet
show with original words, sung by
two ladies with lovely voices.

Phi Mu chose to make shadow pic-
tures of their sweetheart girl; four
swaggering Delta Phi Epsilon pirates
sang to the audience about a treasure
chest opened on a shadow screen. Beta
Sigma Omicron bid for the cup with

,a skit called “We Saw the Sea” which

the audience did—a blue sea with two
ships which later by tricky arrange-
ment became red sails in the sunset.

Phi Sigma presented “Around the

ding of a Tri-Delt girl. Wltll an 1890

Delta Zeta had four girls, represent-

Research Worker
Tells Of New Dye

Recent Chemistry Body Tappees
Initiated At Ceremonies

“The problem of dyestuffs is as
much a psychological and physiolog-
ical as a chemical matter,” declared
Robert E. Rose, director of duPont’s
research laboratory, in his lecture last
'Th11l‘Sd‘<1Y evening at Engineering
Hall, Carnegie Tech.

The past ten years, which have seen
dyestuffs develop into a. huge industry,
have also recorded many new devel-
opments not only in the increased
number of dyes but in the matter of
their application. One important im-
provement has been the development
of a dye which will take 011 cellulose
acetate popularly known as rayon.
This will be a great boon to the ar-
tiﬁcial silk industry.
