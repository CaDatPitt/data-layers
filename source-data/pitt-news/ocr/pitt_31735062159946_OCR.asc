1500 Students Get

TB Chest

X-Rays

An estimated 1500 Pitt students have taken advantage
of the free chest X-Ray test which goes into its third day
today, according to Jack Burwinkle, chairman of the drive.

Sponsored by Student Congress, the tuberculosis tests
started ‘a Monday and will continue until tomorrow after-
noon. Today and tomorrow, the tests will be given from

9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Yesterday

and Monday the tests were

given until 10 p.m. so that evening students could get their free

X-Rays.

The equipment is set up in 47
student desk.

Dr. H. C. Carlson, head of the

,.

Cl. on the ground ﬂoor near the

Men’s Health Service who helped

Student Congress obtain the nec-¢
essary equipment, pointed out that
it only takes 12 seconds to take the
test.

Carlson also stated that TB
“can only be cured when noticed
in its early stages. Advance cases
of tuberculosis can often mean
death, and certainly every Pitt stu-
dent can spare 12 seconds to ﬁnd
out if he has this disease.”

By Health Department

The tests are being given by the
Pittsburgh Department of Public
Health, in co-operation with the
Tuberculosis League of Pittsburgh.
The X-Ray equipment is being‘ op-
erated by city technicians.

The simplicity with which the
tests are given eliminates the nec-

=1: :2: a:

essity of‘ undressing, yet the cam-
era can detect the slightest trace of
tuberculosis, said Carlson.

Test results will be mailed to
students before Christmas vacation
begins.

Contagious Disease

A spokesman for the Pittsburgh
health department pointed out that
TB is contagious and “can be com-
municated easily to members of
the family and friends.”

Carlson and Student, Congress
hope to have 3500 or more stu-I,
dents take the test before the

equipment leaves Pitt. The Men’s

Health Department head said that
he hoped “every Pitt instructor
will urge his students to take the
tests, and that they take it them-
selves.”

THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

‘WED, DEC. 5, 1951

Opposed vehemently by

the American Legion".

The Oath Bill, passed by .the
State Senate last April, was re-
written by the House Committee
on State Government, and comes
up for its third reading in the
House Dec. 10. A vote could come
the next day.

Legion For Bill

A r t h u r Varney, Allegheny
County Commander of the Amer-
ican, told the News that “we’re
one hundred per cent for the bill,”
and that he sees “no reason why
any loyal American would hesi-
tate to sign an oath.”

Both the Legion and the Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars are lobby-
ing for the measure. ,

Groups of teachers at Pitt have
reiterated their opposition to the
Bill. Professor John Honnold_ of

According to Dr. T. S. Danowski,
professor of research medicine,
the grant will be used to study a
hormone which stimulates the thy-
roid gland. The hormone is called
thyrotropic and the study will be
in conjunction with the Addison
H. Gibson Laboratory staff.

New Discoveries

The laboratory recently an-
nounced two new discoveries, one
a treatment for cancer in the chest
and lungs, another a tool for work
on brain tumors.

The lab is under the supervision
of Dr. Campbell Moses.

The Gibson Laboratory, set up
in 1948 from funds of Addison H.
Gibson, a western Pennsylvania
oil man, has reported that a way
to combat the complication of can-
cer in the lungs and chests is its
most outstanding accomplishment
to date. ,

Panther All-American

Humor Mag Gets First

The Panther magazine has been awarded the National
Scholastic Press Association’s All-American rating for last

year’s issues.

The receipt of the honor rating
was announced by Dr. Denton
Beal, publications director, who
stated, “Winning the All-Amer-
ican rating from the NSPA is a
real feather in the cap of the Pan-
ther and the whole university.”

Won Professional

According to Don Horowitz, ed-
itor of last year’s award—winning
Panther, “The Panther won its top
rating in competition with many
college magazines having paid
staffs, school appropriations and
other aspects of professional jour-
nalism. I think the award can be
credited to the Panther’s policy of
covering the Pitt scene with an
originality in humor and near-
professional work by editor and
staff members.”

This rating, highest given by

the NSPA’s critical service, was
for the 1950-51 school year, and
was based on such aspects of mag-
azine production as editorial con-
tent, art work, photography, ed-
iting, makeup, typography, and
mechanical considerations.
4 Out of 78

Four college magazines out of
78 entered received the All-Amer-
ican rating.

The Panther rated particularly
high last year in “original humor
of each issue;” editing and make-
up arrangement; typography con-
sideration; and editorial content.

Superlatives Lavished

On “Kiss Me Kate”

By DICK
Send out for superlatives.

SNYDER V
‘Kate’s’ back in town-—“Kiss

Me Kate,” that is-—and it’s time again to dust off all the
happy adjectives, like bright and breezy and beautiful.
If you missed this girl when the Civic Light Opera had,

her a couple seasons ago, put hei¢
down as a must on this week’s
budget. For this is a joyful com-
bination of Shakespeare, Spewack,
and Porter, and a dazzler of large
dimensions.
Top of Ladder

Briefly, “Kiss Me Kate” is
Shakespeare’s Taming of the
Shrew elevated to a top rung in
the laughs department by Sam and
Bella Spewack’s lively book, and
spiced with some of the freshest
Cole Porter music and lyrics in
years. Only Porter could have
rhymed Padua and “cad you ah”,
“puberty” and “Schuberty”, put
it to music, and ‘gotten away with
it.

The hands at work here are al-
ways exhilarating and affection-
ate. Mr. Porter’s score, which has
been bruited about by most of the
country’s third-rate songsters, is
in jeweled company now, and the
sounds are tinsel to the. ears.

Spirited Performers

Too, you are not likely to catch
a more attractive or spirited group
of performers at the Nixon this
season. I thought Holly Harris’s
‘Kate’ a sheer delight, and Robert
Wright’s ‘Petruchio,’ and Marilyn
Day as Bianca hardly less entranc-
ing; that Hank Henry and
Sparky Kaye cut two hilarious
valentines as the protectors of a
ﬂoating crap game; and that of
Porter’s music, “Were Thine That
Special Face” was ﬁrst—rate, with
the now poular “So In Love” and
“Wunderbar” hummable seconds.

In fact everything about “Kiss
Me Kate” is so (gbviously top-

reportedly pointed out “specific
defects”, in the revised bill.
S “Deﬁnes” Subversives

The Bill calls a person “subver-
sive’f by reason of what he “ad-
v o c a t e s , abets, advises, or
teaches,” and if he “is knowingly
a member” of a subversive organ-
ization. Concrete standards of loy-
alty are not deﬁned. \ ,

Opponents of the Bill claim
that the loose wording of the term
“subversive” may lead to the sup-
pressing ofunpopular ideas. They
also object to alleged withdrawal
of procedural safeguards of spec-
iﬂc notice of charges and court
review.

‘.9 Using these records for recrea-

tion of the blind is of great help
in their education. Druids asks for
any kind of records, "classical or
popular, and any speed. They re-
quest that these records be

brought to the school before
Christmas vacation.

ual students have at least two or
three records which thef no long-
er use.’ Although they consider
them useless, they will be of great
aid, for the relaxation ‘of the
blind,” says Ludwig Lippert, pres-
ident of Druids.

Students can leave the records
in the Information.Room, Student
Desk, or the eighth ﬂoor. Boxes in
which to deposit the records will
be placed at all of these locations.

Congress Bucks CR

 

 

Noise in Open Meet

A transient audience of approximately 200 looked on as
Student Congress competed with the hum of the Commons
Room at an open meeting last Friday.

As students scufﬂed through the halls and across the"

Commons Room SC members had:

to raise their voices to discuss bus-
iness and give reports.

Results of the Pitt Chest Drive

A and Dad’s Day were aired as well

as the plans for the Chest X-Ray
program now in operation.

No Devision
The question of women cheer-

leaders was discussed but again

no decision was reached.

At the close of the meeting, sc
members answered questions from

‘ the audience.

The concensus of opinion from

the observers was that SC could ,

well have used their PA system to
drown out the bustle of the Com-
mons Room. They were not mer-

‘ mitted to use it ho\Never,. because

of classes in session during the
meeting.

Students polled ‘gave various

opinions of SC’s first attempt at
such a meeting.

Paul Kachlis, Law School, “Im-
pressive in that students may
openly express their opinion.”

Good Idea

Elaine Masamed, Col. ’55, “Now
that the Commons Room is at last
being used for something, I think
this is one of the best uses I've
heard of yet.” <‘

Betty Roulf, Co. ’53, “I think

it’s a nuisance, if they wanted -to

‘do this they should have used

Stephen Foster Memorial.”

Sylvia Zasofsky, Col. ’53, “An
impressive attempt, but the stu-
dents aren’t co-operative.”

However many ‘of the students
who came in, gazed curiously, and
moved on would have agreed with
Henry Daubner, Col. ’54: “I didn’t
listen to it.”

Somethinglnew has ‘been added to the old Greek way of

“In the Pitt Players’ produc-
tion of_ “Oedipus Rex,”, which
will be ‘staged in Foster Memo-
rial on Dec. 13, 14, 15, the old
standby or Greek drama," the
chorus, will be used---with vari-

’ations.

Originally, the chorus was used
to keep the dialogue between the
two or three main characters from
becoming monotonous. It also
served to interpret the action to
the audience.

Chorus Acts As Unit
Used primarily to reinforce the
moods or speeches of the leading

, character, the chorus responds as

a unit, emphasizing the moods

I through gestures and movement.

The ‘Players’ version of “Oedipus
Rex” willykeep the same classical
ﬂavor but will add innovations to

~ suit the taste of the modern audi-

 

ence. Two’ choruses, both male and
female, will replace the traditional
single chorus.

In the early theater, all female
roles were taken by men. But
Players’ have followed modern
practice by using women to por-
traym the feminine characters.

A Ne w Tradition

When one tradition falls another usually rises to take
its place. Last spring the old taboos against dancing in
the Commons Room toppled and the ﬁrst dance in the Uni-
versity’s history was held under the arches.

. The second dance, which takes place Dec. 14, will de-
termine whether this new tradition will continue or die.
Its success or failure rests with the student body.

With tickets selling for two dollars per couple——the
cheapest formal ever held on campus—-attendance should
easily reach the maximum of 600 set by the "Christmas Ball
committee. ‘ » ’

If you plan to go to any formal at all in your four
years here, you couldthardly select a better one than the
Christmas Ball. Then the Commons Room will be decorated
for the Yule season and all of its intrinsic beauty will be

* enhanced by holly and fir and soft lights. '

. You couldn’t wind up the 1951 social season in a better
way. For two dollars, you can’t go wrong.

The Open Meeting

The open mee,ti_ng«of Student Congress last Friday was
a success and a failure. .
A It succeeded in that the legislators were able to give
a ﬁrst hand demonstration of their procedure, anvexcellent
debit and credit summary of the year’s activities and an ex-

A planation of somecof the problems they wrestle with each

Monday in 239 C1. The program was well planned and
admirably executed. * .. .

But the meeting was_a failure because the attendance
was miserable. There are" probably just as many people in
the dark about Congress today as there were before Friday.

Even though the ‘meeting was held in ,a central loca-
tion and given a large amount of advanceipublicity, those

'1 students who hang out ,-in the Commons Room were not

interested enough to interrupt their conversations and listen.
Congress still faces an apathic electoral public. But
you can’t say they aren’t trying. ;j

  Joiners on the March

There are signs that an evangelistic movement:

is underway on campus. The missionaries are out
to convert the indifferent student to the more
abundantilife offered in student activities. Their
battle cry is “salvation through participation.”

These zealots feel that the heathen student, who
is now largely unconcerned about their labors in
the activities world, will become
a better “man for joining them.‘
On a loftier level they hold that
greater participation by more
students will make this a better
University to live in.

The New Jerusalem they so
fervently picture is admirable.
Perhaps those lost souls now
ﬂoating about in the limbo of :
the Commons Room and the Red .  
Tuck will ﬁnd the educational process In e tis-
fying if they are persuaded to sink their teeth into
an activity; perhaps the old school will become a
more congenial place. It is difficult to question the
beneﬁts they predict.

But these Jesuits of the active life have based
their campaign on some rather broad and, possibly,
fallacious assumptions. They hold that those stu-
dents who are not now taking part in activities want
to do so; that they should take part whether _they
want to or not and that these activities are worth-
while. M
They Don't Want To ‘

It is highly possible that many of those heretical
individuals want no part of activities. Certainly
there are few restrictions on joining.

Many students just don’t have the time to at-
tend meetings and rallies and clubs. They have
jobs, families to support, live‘ at inconvenient dis-
tances. Some of them probably think that classes
and studies are more important.

The argument that anyone should be anything

  

Actions Better Than Words

“Brotherhood, its wonderful,” is what differing

‘campus groups seem to be, saying to each other.

Like virtue, everybody’s for it. ,

Last week at Pitt, students from district
colleges sat in on a “Rumor Clinicf’ sponsored by
the college age division of the National Conference

. of Christians and Jews. February 17 the parent

organization will back a national Brbtherhood
Week. - ’ t A y ,

Most of us still are able to recall the provocative
Pinky, LostlBoundaries, Gent1eman’s Agreement—
all a far cry from the conventional motion picture
of a decade ago. Sinclair Lewis’s best seller, Kins-
blood Royal, also dealt with problems arising from
inter-racial contacts. 1 ‘

Some of the best of the foreign policy analysts
have claimed that the success of our far-Eastern
policy hinges upon our treatment of racial minori-
ties at home. - 1 ‘

Point With Pride

Pitt students can point with pride to certain of

their groups who practice, on a local scale, demo-—

cratic living. The man on campus at the Cathedral
has also met up with some of the rotten apples in

Letters To The Editor’ . 
Prejudice Is Real Issue

Editor,
The Pitt News »

You are undoubtably aware of the mimeo-
graphed letter criticizing The Pitt News which is
being widely distributed. by the Interfraternity
Council. This letter points out that a_ columnist
seriously misquoted a fraternity man . V.
Council claims you refused to publish their letter
of correction . .

If this is true, your action is . . . regrettable
. . . because a good newspaper—— and The Pitt News
is on the whole a mature, serious and stimulating
paper—-only adds to its stature by freely admitting

and correcting mistakes which are bound to creep

into a newspaper.

. . . your alleged action . . . is even more un-
fortunate because it has given IF a screen to hide
behind and thus confuse the real issue. The real
issue is racial and religious discrimination on the
part of too many social fraternities.

The IF Council . . shamelessly defends its
discriminatory policy. They excuse their discrimi-
nation on the grmmd_ that “several organizations
such as the Lutheran Student Association, Newman
Club and others foster a social and educational life
for speciﬁc religious groups.” The inference is that

or a part of anything is hard to defend. It is de-
batable whether you get as much’ from an activity
as-you put in it. When you compare an activity
with the relative possibilities of some other oe-_
cupation, you are even more hard pressed to defend
it.

_It has never been proven that activities build ’
character or instill responsibility any more than .-

doesdriving a truck or clerking in a grocery store."
Like football, the net effects may be commendable ,
or they may be disastrous. If the potentialities are ‘
latent ‘in the individual, then almost any situation/”
will call forth his abilities.

When most people refer to activities as being
educational, they usually do so at the expense of
formal education. True, you can learn a lot about
people in the activity world, but you could pick u
the same knowledge in other areas. ‘
Book Learning Now —

The four years we spend here are allegedly the

years in which we receive the wisdom of the aggc
and the lore of science. We get this information
from books and from men paid to pass it on to us.
After we leavehere a few of us will have the time
to hit the books. «

Many students believe this to be the proper ob- .. A
jective of their stay here. They want to read and ..

listen and study. They want to ﬁnd out what the
thinkers and doers'of the past have to say; they

are not concerned about the utterances of our states- if 
men in Student Congress, nor in those of the em-- "

bryonic Garden Club leaders in WSGA.
Much of this soul searching about the poor

student who is not in activities is needless. They‘ 
a§en’t worried and they don’t want us to worry. ‘

We set up a premise that they want to be leader‘:
without consulting them and then act as though we
did. We are probably wrong. A h

Both Inter-fraternity Council and the Inde-

pendent Association claim they oppose discrimina-

tory practices. Both, then, should be willing to take

concrete action to wipe out tracesof Jim Crow at 

the University. I

i A committee, composed of members’ of the two
rival groups, as. well as delegates from the
YMCA and Student Congress, Women's Self
Government Association and Men’s Council, could

probe into the situation, bringing’, pressure to beat,‘ x

on offending parties. ‘

rather than words, where they stand. The results . 1

may be more

project. ‘ P‘

The committee could proﬁt from an examina-‘ii’
tion of the working of the YMCA. Over the lastm
three years the Y has had a Lutheran, a Catholie,g

and a Jew as president. Students of all creeds
and stocks are active and welcome in the. Y.

The Pitt college age divisibn of the National:

Conference of Christians and Jews has explored .
various avenues leading to brotherhood. Kappa
Beta Phi, a non—sectarian social fraternity here, 5
has rushed Negro students and cut freely across
religious lines. The athletic teams, unlike fthe”
medical school, do not care about race or religion.

There are groups at Pitt practicing brotherhood
all year,‘ not for just one week. There ‘could be
.more.

groups are—as everyone knows--open to anyone 
who wishes to attend. More than that, they  _

doubtably ‘seek members. They are inclusive. Too if

many fraternities are exclusive. As such they are 

patently undemocratic and unfraternal in the true
senses of the words. It was a mistake not to pub-
lish their letter because IF Council’s own words‘
condemn their position eloquently.

Lauds Chest Speakers .

Editor «

The Pitt News , ,
The success of the recent Pitt Chest ‘drive is

attributed to many factors. Good management, ad- 

vertising, and student support were important. As “

in past years, though, the success or failure of the

drive hinged upon the work of the individual

speakers. This year the speakers were exception-
ally co-operative, energetic and able. We would ,
therefore like to takethis opportunity to publicly 
commend and thank all of them for their help in«*

Swimmers Loosen Up

By RUSSELL FRANKE

Coach Ben Grady’s tankers
are preparing for their ﬁrst
test of the season against
Franklin and Marshall Dec. 12 at
the YM&WHA pool.

This meet, the ﬁrst on the
schedule of twelve, will mark the
return of ten lettermen, an indi-
cation of a bright future for the
local crew. Five additions from
last year’s frosh ﬁgure to bolster
the team even more.

Big gun and captain for Pitt is
free-styler Jim Zentgraf, who has
continued to turn in record per-
formances meet after meet. Jim’s
knack for piling up points was a
big factor in last year’s 6-2 record.

Crack Diver Lost

The only big loss for the Pan-
thers is ace diver Al Ciocca, who
graduated, but Tom Blosser is ex-
pected to ﬁll his spot adequately.
Tom was considered the finest un-

diving circles.

On the basis of experience and
past performances, this should be
the best Grady team in a long
time. But the elongated schedule,

Along with

Six; Rookie
Outwrestle

By DON SCHURMAN

With the season-opener less
than two weeks away, Pitt’s
rookie wrestlers, outshining
their more-experienced mates in
practice, threaten to dominate the
starting lineup.

Competing in their ﬁrst year on .

the varsity, four sophomores and
two freshmen won six of the eight

weight-divisions in the ﬁrst intra-
squad tournament held at Trees
gym last week.

There will be two more such
tournaments, based on the ladder-
ranking system, before Rex Peery
takes his grapplers to Indiana
State Teacher’s college on Dec. 15.
The winners of the ﬁnal tourna-
ment will then form the starting
lineup. ,

Cappelli Beaten

“Such tournaments will be held
throughout the season,” said
Peery. “They will determine the
starting lineup for each meet.”

Top upset of the ﬁrst tourna-
ment, runoff on single eliminations,
was a 5-0 defeat of senior letter-
man Ray Cappelli by sophomore
George Matthews. Cappelli, how-
ever, has missed several weeks of
practice because of an elbow in-
jury.

The only two veterans who did
win top positions were juniors
Harold Miller in the 130-pound
class and Joe Kane as a heavy-
weight.

Sophs, Fresh Click

As was expected, sophomore
Hugh Peery, undefeated since his
second year in high school, easily
took the 123-pound title and soph-

Pitt Faces Penn Rebels
Of Gator Bound Miami

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Pitt’s Northern Yankees charge into the Southland Fri-

day night to close out their

ten—game grid schedule with

the Pennsylvania rebels of Miami. .

Miami’s Hurricanes, who have already accepted a Gator
Bowl bid to meet Clemson on New Year’s Day, boast a 7-2
record thanks to their Pennsylvania imports.

Seven of the starting eleven gridders originally settled‘
in Pennsylvania and six other var-‘A’

sity performers also hail from the
Keystone State.
Old Home Week

Of course the reason for the
steady enrollment of backyard
talent to Miami can be traced to
the athletic family at the Southern
school.

Head Coach Andy Gustafson,
former Pitt fullback and assistant
coach under Jock Sutherland in

1933, knows football talent when"

he spies it. Hart Morris, Hurri-

cane line coach, also played at Pitt

in 1936-38 as did Jack Harding,
director of athletics.

Friday’s night game will be the
ﬁrst Florida engagement for a Pitt
grid team and also marks the ﬁrst

147-pound class.

Another sophomore, Bud Wise,
captured the 177-pound division.
The two freshmen that made good
early were Canonsburg’s Joe Solo-
mon, PIAA champ last year, in the
157-pound class and Willard Mc-
Marlin of Shaler as a 167-pounder.

Gail Ellis, heavyweight letter-
man last year, was unable to com-

pete because of a dislocated

him out of action indeﬁnitely.

“Not Big, But Fast”

Contrary to this, Miami hasn’t
lost a night tilt in two years. The
last arc-light setback was in 1949
to Maryland.

Pi/tt line coach Steve Hokuf, who A.
latest victory ‘

scouted Miami’s
against Nebraska, 19-7, was im-
pressed with the ’Canes.

“They’re probably the fastest
team we’ve faced, except for
Michigan State,” Hokuf admitted,
“and they're not big at all, but
awfully fast.” ,

Last For Capt. Tom

Hokuf veriﬁed what grid ob-
servers have said all season about
the exceptional Miami defense.

“You don’t exactly know what
their line is going to do. Some-
times the ends crash and at times
they drift.” The Pitt line coach
cited Jim Dooley, defensive back,
Jim Shiver, linebacker, end Leo
Martin, a Westinghouse product,
and halfback Frank Smith for
their outstanding showings. ’_

Eleven grid seniors bow out
against Miami as does Head Coach
Tom Hamilton. Hamilton, serving
as interim coach for a single sea-
son, returns to his post as athletic
director.

The Panther company leaves by
plane-for Miami tomorrow morn-
ing at 10 p.m. and will not return
till Sunday.

Contrary to ppre-season thinking television did not hinder
Pitt’s Stadium attendance this season.

Latest ﬁgures released by the Athletic Department show

‘an almost 50 per cent increase in attendance over last

year. ,6

The first game—against Duke
-—was televised in Pittsburgh
and Johnstown. The Notre Dame
contest was played under NCAA
blackout rules;
would have probably been
played before a capacity crowd
regardless of the blackout.

Ohio State drew a large follow-

ing despite the fact that the Notre f _

Dame-Michigan State ‘big game’!
was on TV. 7

29,000 Per Game Average
The poor attendance at the
Mountaineer game can be account-
ed for by the weather conditions.
The same is true for the Penn
State game. But these two games
drew 5,000 more than last year.

The Panther-Hurricane meeting
on Friday night looms as an all-
important affair for the Pitts. Not
since 1949 when the Panthers built
a ﬁve-game winning skein has Pitt
come close to three straight ver-
dicts. That streak was eclipsed by
an ill-fated venture to Indiana.
For Pitt to defeat the Gator Bowl-
bound Miamians, the three-game
streak would be an added incen-
tive for next year’s ball club.
Hurricanes Storm This Area

Coach Tom Hamilton, who will
be known as Athletic Director Tom
Hamilton after Friday, has used 23
freshmen and eleven sophomores
in Blue-and-Gold uniform this
Season.

A victory over Miami would
be just ducky, since it would
mark a win over a Western
Pennsylvania raider. It would
be the ﬁrst, if accomplished,
over a constant district-talent
stealer. _

Field House Hits
Purse—$1 7,000

Pitt’s brand-new indoor play-
ground will be officially opened
Dec. 15 with dedication ceremon-
iesﬁpreceding the season lidlifter
against Columbia.

This is the inauguration of a
new era in Panther sports, ending
the cries for a decent ﬂoor to host
the visiting schools -and giving
Pitt that much-needed big-time
touch.

Sports Shorts

Two more names have been‘
tossed into the ring as nominees-
for the Pitt football coach of 1952.
One is Harry Stuhldreher, former-
ly of Wisconsin, and the other is
Earl Blaik, Army’s coach.

Don’t count Johnny Michelo-
sen out, however. If the Uni-
versity wants an alumnus, the
Steeler coach will be in the
running.

Congratulations to Jim Marks of
the sports staff for leading all
Yogis with a .685 average. Only
the Pitt-Miami score is needed for
ﬁnal tabulations. Gentleman Jim
was last seen burying the crystal
ball in Panther Hollow.

Yanks Display Hoop Skill
In Downing M erts, 49-43

By STEVE PASSAMANECK

A little experience and skill
mean a lot in a fast game of_
basketball. The Pitt Yanks
had just enough of both to defeat
a tall rangy Mert Five, 49-43.

Floyd Ho1stein—formerly of the
Pitt varsity basketeers-was the
Yank sparkplug and the evening’s
high scorer with 18 big points.
Holstein zeroed in the Mert Five
hoop and proceeded to sink a bar-
rage of ﬁeld goals from the out-
side.

Andy Zeedick took second place
scoring honors with 11. George
Ranovich ‘was high point man for
the Mert Five, connecting for 12.

Smooth ba1l—handling and sharp
defensive work stood out on both
sides. Zeedick was especially
tough to stop under the boards.

HOW MANY TIME

DO YOU

 

‘Although the hassle was nip-
and—tuck down to the wire, the
Yanks hung on to a narrow mar-
gin. From the opening whistle on
the Stadium court, the Yanks
squeezed out a lead which they
stretched to 22-16 at the half and
to the ﬁnal 49-42 edge.

Just to show what a little var-
sity experience can do for a hoop-
ster, while Holstein was scoring
his 18 Yank points, he committed
not a single personal foul.

a Hard Work Marks Nurses’ Training

By CLARK SUTTON
Male members of Pitt’s student body
are sure to ﬁnd that the most pleasant

‘place to visit on the University’s far-

flung campus is Elizabeth Steel Magee
Hall, home of the student nurses.

The only drawback is, it’s a rather
diﬁicult job to get to'see the nurses.

You can only visit them when they’re
not busy working, and that's a very rare
occasion. Between classes and daily
chores in the hospitals, the student
nurses don’t have much time for a
pleasant afternoon talking with Pitt men
who have nothing better to do.

As one nurse put it, “The one advan-
tage of working in hospitals is that they
can take care of us if we collapse from
overwork.”

Nurses Start at Cathedral

The student nurses’ academic career
starts at the Cathedral where they take
two years of college work. Mixed’ with
their‘ courses in chemistry, psychology,
and other studies applicable to their
work, they take general courses in Eng-
lish, speech, and other electives. After
these two years of “liberal” education,
they move to Magee Hall at Forbes and
Halkgt streets where they start three
years of constant classroom work and
rotation from hospital to hospital.

September marks the beginning of
this training, and they are on six months
probation. During this time they spend
two hours on the floor in the morning,
and some time in the afternoon engaged
in hospital duties. The rest of the time
is spent in classes.

Student nurses are “capped” in March,
and in their ﬁrst summer they begin ro-
tating to the other hospitals in the Uni-
versity Medical Center. In these insti-
tutions they have practical work in
medicine, surgery, work‘ in the diet
kitchen, and, in short, get pracgtice in all
fields of nursing. ' ‘

Fees Not Abnormal

During their ﬁrst six months as stu-
dent nurses, they are required to pay
room and board of $50 a month. After
that, it’s free. “Why not?” said one.
“We’re actually working in these hos-
pitals, and it’s the only compensation we
receive.”

The matter of costs is not generally a
‘touchy subject for the nurses. They are
charged, in the three years of actual
nurses training, a basic fee of $220 a
calendar year. Their ﬁrst year costs, in-
cluding books, an ees, about $370. The
second and third y rs cost $290 and
$268, respectively., In their ﬁrst two

years at the college they are charged at
the same rate as other Pitt students.
Curfews Are _Sorespots

When the student nurse rotates to
other hospitals, she generally stays in
that particular hospital’s nurse’s home.

Nurses get a month’s vacation each, year,
and, after their probationary period, un-
limited midnight dating privileges. Dur-
ing probation they are permitted two
midnight privileges a week. But in all
cases, they must apply for overnight
privileges, and permission to stay out
until 1 a.m.

That’s where the rub comes in. The
student nurses feel that they should
have 1 a.m. privileges at their discre-
tion, contending that if they are capable
enough to care for the sick they can
take care of themselves. At least, until
1 a.m.

Overnight privileges are generally
granted providing the student does not
have classes or hospital work before 10
a.m. the next day.

Of themselves, the nurses say, “We
work as hardas student nurses, but we
enjoy every minute of it. There’s al-
ways some griping going on, but it
doesn’t amount to much, and when it’s
all said and done . . . we have a heck
of a lot of fun.”

cancer of the lungs and chest.

He also said, “It should be noted
that it was possible to develop
this new method of increasing the
comfortable and useful life of
patients with this type of cancer
only because the research funds
provided by the university and
the Addison H. Gibson Foundation
Trustees were unrestricted.”

The other development of the
lab is the scintillation counter ap-
paratus for use in the localization
of brain lesions. It was built and

THE DU PONT

DIGEST

M.E.’s AT DU PONT [31  

Plant engineering. and production supervision
offer interesting careers for science graduates

In the past two issues of the Digest
you’ve read of the broad opportuni-
ties that are offered mechanical en-
gineers in research and development
work at Du Pont.

This month let’s look at oppor-
tunities for men interested in any
of the branches of plant engineering
—-such as maintenance, power, design
and construction——or in production
supervisiqn.

Efficient maintenance is an i.mpor-
tant cost factor in the continuous
processes of a modern chemical in-
dustry. The M.E. is called upon to
diagnose troubles, workﬂout correc-
tive measures, and supervise repairs.
Frequently he increases produc-
tion by developing preventive main-
tenance .measures. So vital is this
work that in one division of the Com-
pany, 500 men of all crafts, along
with a routine maintenance group.
spend almost all their time on it.
One example of‘ the problems fac-
ing Du Pont engineers is the main-

 
 
  
 
   
   
  
  

  
  
 
   
 
  

tenance of pumps made to tolerances
of 0.0001” and operating at pressures
up'to 6000 p.s.i.

In power work, also, problems re-
quiring application of mechanical en-
gineering principles arise. For in-
stance, a metal required in one chem-
_ical process is melted at 800°F. by
immersion heaters ﬁred by butane,
which is expensive. Conversion to
fuel oil presented the problem of
complete combustion in the immer-
sion chamber. Du Pont M.E.’s re-
designed the heaters so ‘combustion

sdreduled for minimum disruption of output.
could be complete and the hot gases
recycled in water to use all the avail-
able heat.

In design and construction of
chemical plants, mechanical engi-
neering again is of majorimportanoe
because of the wide variety of plants
built and intricacy of their equip-
ment. Engineers collect basic data,

State '51, and D. A. Smith, B.S.M.E., Pur-
due '40, discuss a change in feed wheel design
of nylon spinning machine. ,

 

‘ Production supervision attracts many

mechanical engineers. Men who “have
the ability and interest usually move
into it by one or two routes: they ac-
quire background on all stages of a
plant’s operations by helping design
the plant, or” by operating on the job.‘

MAINTENANCE TEAM making a speedy change of
a methanol valve to minimize production loss.

Sometimes students of mechanica1en-
gineering feel that in a chemical com-
pany they will be overshadowed by
chemical personnel. This is not the case
at Du Pont. Here, hundreds of adminis-
trators and supervisors, up to the rank
of vice-president, started as M.E.’s.
