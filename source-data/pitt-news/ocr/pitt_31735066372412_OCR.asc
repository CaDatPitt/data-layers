Geography Future

The future of the geography

the FAS Ad Hoc Committee on the
Geography Department have been
appointed to ‘study

department and FAS Dean Jerome

the elimination of the department.

claims it has encountered only “pro-
cedural confusion. delay and unwil-
lingness on the part of the faculty
and others to resolve the matter.”

I cautioned. however. that the salary

increase was tentative until the state
decides how much Pitt will eventu-

The salary increase “is even less
than tentative.”'he said. ‘‘It’s just a
suggestion (to the state) that says
we’d like to beable to give salary

The survey. based on. data from

also found that salaries for faculty
members in engineering and compu-

be taking three general things into
consideration when it plans for
faculty and staff salary increases:
inflation. the competitiveness of
Pitt’s salaries in relation to those of
other universities. and how much
money will be available in the
budget to provide salary increases.

The university has usually

money targeted for salary increases

the other one-third for salar)’
increases on merit.

hikes of 7 percent for last year and 6
percent for this year..

The conflict resulted from a posi-
tion paper recently released by the
Social Sciences Council. Wasser-
man admitted that the report is a
“good one underthe limitations they
were working with."

The limitation Wasserman
referred to is the fact that the com-
mittees were asked to make a bud-
getary evaluation although they
didn’t have access to budget figures.

The report states that the council
is “not in a position to make bud-
getary feasibility judgments."
Instead, itgrecommends that the
matter be taken up by the Ad Hoc

Committee which should “closely
review the budgetary feasibility of
the position taken by the depart-
ment ofgeography. and question the
dean on his programatic priorities.“

The Ad Hoc Committee has not
yet ‘met. though a meeting is sche-
duled to take place in the near
future. , A ,

The council supported the depart-
ments proposal. which calls for:

0- appointing as chairman Ted
Muller of history and urban studies;

0 appointing two additional
faculty members, to be paid out of
the retiring chairman’s salary;

0 limiting the scope ofthe depart-

scribed as the “highly competitive"
nature ofthe salary increases for Pitt

“We've gone out of our way in the
last couple of years to give increases
which are significantly above the
average being given in other institu-
tions around the country. I think we
are quite competitive," he said.

ment to environmental studies and
urban geography.

“We recognize the clear academic
desirability" of the department's
proposal. the report reads, “and
further we commend the department
of geography for a proposal that
seems itself cognizant" of special
budgetary constraints. 

The council agreed with the
department that the financial gain to
FAS would be minimal ifthe depart-
ment is terminated.

Because of the struggle between
the dean and the department, the
council recommended that“through
some regular administrative
procedure whether through a peri-
odic internal review process culmi-
nating in a frank oral evaluation
communicated by the dean. or a
periodic written assessment by the
dean the departments of FAS
should be apprised of where they
sta’nd."

future eliminate cases similar to geo-

Monty Python Star Chapman
 Explains Why He’s So Funny

By MARGARET ATTWOOD

“To begin. l’d liketoask nicely for
two minutes of real abuse.“

The audience booed louder and
louder and as crumpled papers
began flying through the air. Gra-
ham Chapman of Monty Python
fame applauded. saying. “I like that
....well done....more...._more. That’s
some of the finest abuse that I’ve
ever had. Thank you very. very
much. I mean that sincerely.‘f_ He
then I bowed Moslem-style after
someone gave him the finger.’

The Graham Chapman lecture.
held last night at David Lawrence
Auditorium and sponsored by the
Pitt Program Council. was not the
usual campus lecture affair. Chap-
man claimed that he is lecturing on
American campuses as a free way to
see the country.

Interlaced between TV and film
clips. Chapman answered questions
from the audience about his role as a
comedy writer and actor. his movies.

his problems with alcohol. and
about the other five writers who
form the Monty Python team.

Chapman said that Monty
Python was created when the five
writers for the David Frost show
realized that they were contributing
most of the show‘s material.

Chapman said. “A lot ofthe mate-
rial we wrote was good but didn’t get
printed because it was too filthy or
too silly.” Eventually theydecided to
create their own show and incorpo-
rate some of these ideas.

The name of Monty Python‘s Fly-
ing Circus came about. according to
Graham because “the word circus
was attributed to our group ofwrit—
_ers in an informal way and it some-
how was put down on paper by the
BBC head of comedy.” I

Instead of going through a
bureaucratic tangle to remove the
name. they added the word “flying"
to make it sound like a WW II ﬂying
show instead of an animal circus.

They all agreed that the name
Monty Python sounded like a really
bad theatrical agent. and all liked it
so the name stuck.

Chapman spoke about his former
drinking problem.‘He said. “At 7:30
in the morning while we were shoot-
ing the Holy Grail. I got the DT‘s.

That’s when I decided to quit.'I

haven’t had any alcohol for four
years. although I used to drink quite
a lot. That‘s an understatement. I
drank about o0 ounces ofgin a day. I
began to fear for my liver. brain. and
several other organs. There was no
difficulty quitting other than the
decision to stop."

About his television show and
public response to it. he said.“‘Onc‘e
a lady wrote a really angry letter
saying one of the group was secretly

a homosexual. The letter got angrier

a_nd angrier. saying that he deserved
fire. brimstone and damnation. It
was really terrible.

“One of our group wrote a nice

letter back to her that said we've

discovered who this person is and.

we’ve killed him. We had one ofthe
writers not appear on the show for a
few weeks after that."

Chapman ended the lecture with a
song about a bird who couldn't sing
because it had a beak up its rear.

As he was leaving he said.“Thank
you very much. now p--- off.“

Before fame and fortune des-
cended upon Monty Python's‘
Graham Chapman. he was a doc-
tor. with a degree from Cam-
bridge University. But being a
doctor meant knowing what he
would be doing for the rest ofhis
life. and Chapman had no desire
for that. so he went on to become
part _of England’s funniest
comedy troupe. making movies.
records and television shows.

Somehow the idea of a doctor

becoming a comedian doesn’t
seem so incongruouswhen you
talk with Chapman.

“I went to Cambridge to read
medicine and qualified as a doc-
tor. Meeting people like (Dr.)
Jonathan Miller and Peter Cook
from Beyond the Fringe made
the rest of us at university realize

I that comedy was a credible thing

for postgraduates to go into. Not-
only did it show us new ground.
but it was an intelligent kind of
comedy." said Chapman. Hegis
on the last leg ofa 22—city tour of
college campuses. whichwill end

this week in Florida.

Very British in a red-striped
rugby shirt. and smoking a pipe.
Chapman looked tired’ as his
whirlwind tour of America came
to an end.

“This lecture tour seemed like
a good way to see the States. for
free. which is always nice. I‘ve
lived in New York and L.A.. but
the rest ofthe States. particularly
the Midwest and the Bible Belt.
always seemed like amystery to
me. In chatting with people I am
always surprised at the liberal

‘nature of the people.” said

Chapman.

“There is really very little dif-
ference between American and
English audiences. They appre-
ciate the same kind of things;
situations are the same every-
where. We get quite a bit of TV
from the States in England. I
especially like Hal Linden in Bar-
ney Miller. Taxi. and the early
Saturday Nighi Live. M/ISH is

the material. We've always
worked that way. The more
material we have the more we
can reject," he said.

The Python material is gener-
ally written in short sketches
which are then connected by
“skeletons” later. “This is how
The Holy Grail was done. We
would connect things after-
wards, The Life of Brian less so,"
said Chapman.

Commenting on the contro-

,versy The Life of Brian stirred

up, Chapman noted that “while
it was banned in about nine
states the publicity helped the

film. People who never ‘saw it,

who could only assume what it

‘ was about, were criticizing it.”

That experience has made
Chapman less willing to talk
about the next Python film, but
he did state that they will proba-
bly continue making films
together as a group every two or
three years, “until we’re dirty old

‘ men."

There is little improvisation

I when the Python troupe goes
' before the cameras. ‘

“Everything is written out

 beforehand. We prefer to be
i actors, not writers, when we’re‘

performing. Besides, we are on a
low budget, so we can’t really
afford to improvise all that
much,” said Chapman.

 Last year, though, when the

Python troupe played at the Hol~
lywood Bowl, improvisation did
get into the act.

“The whole atmosphere at the
City Center was like a pop con-
cert. People would be chanting
out lines from our sketches, and
it did become enjoyable after a
time. During the parrot sketch
(in which an angry consumer
tries to return an obviously dead
parrot to the pet storg) John
forgot his lines and he turned to
the audience for help. It was
quite a joyous atmosphere,"
laughed Chapman.

Their famous parrot sketch.
like many of the Python
sketches, is an exaggeration of
real life.

“That came out of a true-life
experience with a second-hand
car salesman. Our humor might
have an odd view to it, but it all
stems from everyday life. My
view is, in all things be true to
yourself,” commented ’Chap—
man.

According to Chapma_n,_/the
rather odd name, “Monty
Python's Flying Circus.” was the
only “name the troupe could
agree on. People suggested
names like Owl Stretching Time
and Horse, Bucket and Spoon,
but none of us could agree on

anything. Then the BBC told us ..

we had to have the word “circus"
in the title, so we added “flying”
so that it wouldn’t sound like a

three—ring affair. Monty Python
sounded like a bad theatrical
agent, so we added that," said
Chapman.

Chapman was born intoa nor-
mal family in Leicester, England,
where his father was a police-
man, but normalcy was never his
desire.

“I was always a bit odd, never
wanted to fit in. I liked making
people laugh, especially when
they shouldn't be, like in church,
or in front of a severe master at

  Mandatory Teaching   Evaluations

By CHRIS CLINTON

When registering for classes.
many students-would like to know
more about the course in general
and more about the instructor who
is teaching the course. You’ve heard
his tests are hard. You§ve heard her
classes run overtime. But that’s all
you’ve heard.

When choosing courses and
instructors. most Pitt students can
only base their choices on rumors
and word-of-mouth. Aside from the
course description book. little is
known about Pitt’s courses. There is
no substantial evidence to support
the rumors about the instructors.

Several candidates in the recent
Student Government Board elec-
tions have cited mandatory. pub-
lished teaching and course
evaluations as one of their goals.
Many of them said that with Pitt’s
high tuition and the proposed cur-
riculum reform. students should
have the right to choose the best
teachers and the best courses. 0 _

Currently. there are evaluations
conducted bythe Office forthe Eval-
uation of Teaching. Sara Strouss.

the assistant to the director. said that
the evaluations are done on a mainly
voluntary basis by the instructor and
the results are strictly confidential.

Sara Strbuss, Office for
the Evaluation of Teaching;

In most cases. if the instructor
does not request that an evaluation
be done. ne will not be conducted.
Strouss said there is “no way that
someone can request it from some-
body else.” in effect. a department
head cannot ask the office that an
evaluation be done on one of his or
her teachers.

Strouss said the evaluations’ pur- ’

poses are “formative and summa-
tive." The formative is for an
ongoing basis. it's for teachers who
want to improve their teaching for
the following term. The summative
purpose is done in decision making
terms. she said. She said many
teachers use their evaluations when

university.

lrwin Schulman. dean ofthe Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences. said he is
in favor of mandatory. published
teaching evaluations. but said that
he is probably in the minority.

He doesn't think. he said. that the
issue canpbe passed with the curricu-
lum reform package.

“lfwe're going to require students
to _take courses. we have to make
sure they‘re damn good courses." he
said.

Bill Abraham. Student

Government President. A

Student Government president

Bill Abraham favors mandatory’

teaching evaluations and said that in
an institution such as Pitt. which is
noted for both its research and
undergraduate study. it is necessary
to have mandatory teaching and
course evaluations.

Abraham cites three reasons for
having the evaluations. He said.it is

    
 
  

Stort ot

   
   
     

     

 
     

the only way for there to be a“check
and balance“ system on the teachers;
teachers themselves need the feed-
back from the students; and it would
aid the students when it came time to
register for classes.

The Student Government Board

did fund a published list ofteaching
evaluations for several years. which
was ‘called The Undergraduate Aca-
demic Review. Abraham said the
review. which hasn’t been published
since the winter of i980. reported
only the teaching evaluations of the
“Cream of the crop."

Abraham said the student govern-
ment was “two steps away from eval-
uating the professors we wanted to
evaluate." ~
* “First.” Abraham said. “the eval-
uations were voluntary. Second. the
professors had to give permission
for it to be published. so if he was
evaluated unfavorably. we couldn't
publish it.“ ,

In an earlier meeting this fall. the
SGB reapproved a request that
would put the publication out again
as early as January. Abraham voted
against the reinstatement ofthe pub-

I.

lication saying that it would “send
inconsistent signals to the
administration."

“On one hand. we're saying we
want mandatory teaching evalua-
tions but on the other we're saying
‘we‘ll print whatever you give us.”
he said. '

Abraham said administering the
mandatory evaluations is a problem.

He said he is not sure if the re-
sources to publish the evaluations
are available but if the university
community as a whole thinks the
evaluations are valuable. then the

university would ‘make sure the I

resources are available.

“If it's just the students pushing
for this. the university won’t find the
resources." he said. ,

The students have to work with
groups like the University Honors
Program. he said. which requires
teaching evaluations. in orderto pull
the mandatory evaluations along

. with the curriculum reform.

“if we unite as many departments
and schools and get the support of
the university. then we could do it.“
Abraham said.

Anyone’s
  ‘Guess.

Now that new course requirements have been
approved, all that remains ofthe lengthy battle of
curriculum reform is for the faculty to agree on
methods of implementation.

Judging from their performance at the last four

curriculum meetings, however, it’s hard to pre- ~-

dictiwhat, if anything, the faculty _will decide.
College of Arts and Sciences Dean lrwin
Schulman had predicted, perhaps wistfully, that

it wouldn’t take long for the package to be

P approved.

But what has happened is that faculty are get-
ting caught in a battle between departments and

definitions, and are still trying to reach some sort
of consensus on the document.

While the greater issue of what constitutes a

"liberal arts education is being carefully ignored,

P the faculty have found the need to concentrate on

such pressing issues as: _
0 Exactlywhat the term bilingual means. A
fascinating, heated debate on this topic came

' down to whether speaking Pennsylvania Dutch

or having conversations over tea with a Russian
grandmother qualified a student as bilingual.

O Exactly what the term non-Western means.
Definition fights are in vogue here. One professor
termed the Curriculum Reform .Committee’s
definition of a non-Western culture as the most
bizarre he'd ever heard. Schulman saved the day

‘by helping the faculty to distinguish between

“foreign” and “super—foreign,” but, finally, one
amendment was introduced that changed all the
terms to “_European”and “non-European,” there-

by eliminating the entire argument.

I Exactly what any of the proposed amend-
ments mean. For faculty who stress preparation
to their students, the meetings have been a case of
doas I say, not as I do. Deep, insightful com-
ments such as “What are we voting on”, “What
does this mean” and “What did he say?” were

some of the more frequent contributions. One

faculty member even submitted a written amend-
ment, only to find out that the amendment was
already included in the original report. Never
mind. . ’

In all fairness, this issue ofcurriculum reform is
a complicated one,‘and the task of defining a
liberal arts education difficult. And it has been
encouraging to see the amount of faculty partici-
pation in the discussions.

But it isn’t fair to the curriculum committee’s \

efforts for the faculty not to make an attempt at
seriously considering the proposals placed before
them. For an entire faculty to agree on a defini-
tion of a liberal arts education is an enormous
undertaking, but it doesn‘t help matters when
faculty deliberately confuse the issue to the point
where no one’s quite sure what they’re voting on
anymore. i P

It Can Happen To You, Too

By REGINA: KVITKOVICH

As a couple walks down a street.

five teenagers follow them. Armed

with wooden chair leg, the youths
hit the man twice on the back ofthe
head. They then grab the womanis
purse, hitting her once on the arm.
Then they run off} laughing.

Whata crime, right‘? Crime has
been on everybody’s mind lately. An
armed robbery took place on Forbes
Avenue recently, and commuters_
daily face ca_r thieves. We all agree

that it's terrible out on the streets.

Most societies contain the idea of
personal property. lt is ironic that in
America, a landdedicated to per-
sonal property. some fundamental

rules which govern property arev

being ignored.

Oh. we still have it. but will we be
allowed to keep it‘? There is a corol-
lary to the concept ofpersonal prop-
erty which states: lf 1 want another
person’s property, l will exchange
something of value for it. Not fol-
lowing this rule is called stealing.

But luckily, we civilized folks all‘

know that’s wrong, and that people
who do that are bad.

Or do we‘? U nfortunately. stealing
has lately been in vogue. Every-
hod_i"s doing it. you know, Of
course, most people we know do it
under the guise of“getting it over on

- the system.”

A/_'ter dinner, a group 'o_f'3()-ish

couples continue their conversation

in the living room. Someone sa_i's
that the cost of Home Box Oﬂiee
(‘able .S‘_t‘S!(’H1 ($8/ month) is reasona-
ble, considering the price ofmoiiie
tickets and gas. Smiling, a woman, a
dentist ’s wife, ’ explains that she
/\'I’I()lt‘S a man who it'ill't‘nstal/ a box

in her TV‘/or $15, and then she will i

be able to get HBO for free. The
('()II\’(’I‘Salf()I.1 moves on.

I wonder what that woman would
have called it‘ when someone “gets“
some free bridgcwork from her hus-
band by avoiding or “forgetting“ his
bills. Wouldn‘t that too be getting
around the system‘?

.Oh, we all do it occasionally.
Methods of cheating coin washers
are passed around as though they
were maps to Sierra Madre. We all
have a fast-food restaurant or hotel
“souvenir."\but it‘s not supposed to
matter if itls from a business. Those
corporations. as we all know, make
bundles; they won’t miss it.

To carry out the logic of the last

statement, we would have to request t

the business’ last profit/loss state-
ment to make sure we're stealing
from someone who won’t miss it.
Also, we should check to see if
there’s an individual owner and

garner a look at his l04O form. In

addition, a prospective thief should
look for extenuating circumstances.
Perhaps the owner has $30,000. out-

standing in medica.l bills because his A

daughter is afflicted with spina

bifida.

So the next time someone tries to

excuse their greed by pointing to

another’s affluence. ask them for
these basic financial facts. See what
was more important in their decision
to steal: their need -or, as they would

like to think, their victims affluence.

This sad situation stems from one
fact. in the sentence. “I want your
property”, our egotistic society pla-
ces more emphasis on the pronoun
“l" than on ‘‘your.’' C

All this would be so much exposi-

tion ofa lamentable fact if it weren‘t

for one thing: the“l“ i.n one situation
can quickly become the “you” in
another. “We have met the enemy
and he is us." P

So the next time, you're‘ walking ,

down an Oakland street at night and
you hear footsteps. behind you
DON'T LOOK BEHIND YOU.
You may see yourself.

Nursing Students  
Advertise Problem,

Dear Editor:

.On Tuesday November 3rd. the
Nursing Student Organization
placed two (2) ads with The Pitt
News, one for Friday/Novemberbth.
and one for Monday November 9th.
t/o advertise our Career Day
Seminar. We were told at the time
the ads were placed that everything
was in order and the ads would be
run. However. on the day before our

"ad was to run. and a day after the
deadline for ads we were'told our

Pitt News contract was missing a
signature.

The fact that the ad would‘ not
run. and the money for the ad which
was allocated to us by the Student
Government Board would belost.
was very upsetting. Realiring there
was nothing we could do. we went to
the Student Activities Office for the
needed signature and to the Student
(iovcrnmcnt Board Office to modify
our budget. This was done by
increasing the sire ofthc Monday ad
so as not to lose any funds and to
hopefully make up for our loss of
advertisement on Friday. Our per-
fectly complcted forms were hand
delivered to The Pitt News office.
where there was a promise made that
the ad would run.

Upon opening M ond.ay’s
(.'\'ovcmbcr 9th) Pitt Neil's and find-
ing no ad. I put in a call to The Pitt
.\'eit's office and was told the adv cr-
tising contract had been placed in

the wrong pile. An advertisement for
our Career Day Seminar, on the

l()th of November. was going to‘he-.

run on November llth.

,Much hard work went into mak-
ing.our Career Day Scminarthe suc-
cess that it was success which came
despite the loss of advertisement.

In its appeal to advertisers. The
Pitt News heralds itself as a news-
paper with a large readership.
Shouldin’t a paper which tries to pro-
mote professionalism be profes-
sional in its dealings’? For the hours

‘ that we spent obtaining signatures

and filling out forms. The Pitt News
spent minutes: first. in rejecting our
ad for lack of a signature.’ and
second. to file the contract paper for
the ad in the wrong place. ‘

I feel our organilation has been
slightcd; and l write this letter pub-
licly so that perhaps a newspaper
which l) by virture of its student
support receives ads funded by our
activity fee. and 2) has a responsibil-
ity to this large university commun-
ity as its main outlet of
communication. will be more recep-
tive to the needs of students and
more professional in its business
transactions. We hope to deal with a
more responsible Pitt .’\/eivs in the
ftl/llll‘C.

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Pitt's leap up to Big East bas-
ketball Wednesday gave'the sub-
stance and means to something
Pitt‘s "athletic officials have
harped on almost since the day

second—vear Coach Roy Chip-
man took up residence in Fitz-

gerald Field House—commit-
‘ment to making Pitt a top-notch
basketball power.

The “why" behind the decision

"is found largely in the benefits-
and there are many ‘that Pitt
can safely expect to accrue from
its marriage to the (now) nine-
team Big East when the Panthers
join league play for the I982-83
year.

Not surprisingly. a list ofthose
benefits is preceded by dollar .
signs. ‘

The‘Big East. with teams now
located in five ofthe nation’s top
ll television markets. offers Pitt
a chunk ofits $l.8 million televi-
sion contract. That comes down
to $200.000 per member. and
should rise when the league beg-
ins holding its post-season_tour-
nament at Madison Square
Garden in I983.

The Big East. through a com-
plex arrangement with four net-
works, including CBS and
ESPN. /has television coverage
slated this year for 52 of 56 con-

‘ ference games. with the potential
to ~.\ reach “25 percent of the j
nation’s TV sets.‘”, according to
Big East Commissioner Dave
Gavitt.

That's more exposure than
Pitt received in its five-year asso-
ciation with the ﬂoundering
Eastern 8 league. the outfit to
which Pitt still is committed for
this l98l-82 season.

Though Pitt won the l98l
Eastern 8 championship and
advanced to the second round of

Pitt Nieves up, Joins Big

Pitt will run into battle on the basketball «court under a different banner—the Big
‘East’s— beginning with the’ 1932-33. season. ‘

the NCAA Championship tour-
nament. the university actually
lost money on the Panther bas-
ketball program after doing its
share to help underwrite the
Eastern" 8’s latest ill-fated
attempt at a television pact. You
remember it—-the package with-
out a sponsor.

The Big East knows no such
problem. Never has. In its three-
year. short-but-sweet existence it
has risen to a prestige parallel
with the more established Atlan-
tic Coast and Big l0
Conferences—as much for its
lucrativeness as for its high qual-

ity of competition.

Beginning in I982, Pitt’s
schedule will include the full I6-
game round robin league sched-
ule. a gantlet that’s comprised of
Syracuse. Boston College. Provi-
dence. Georgetown. Villanova.
St. John‘s. Seton Hall. and Con-

» necticut.

Against competition like that.
it‘s no wonder Gavitt can boast.
“In two years. we can make Pitts-
burgh basketball tickets impossi-
ble to obtain."

And he‘s not just talking-at
five league schools. tickets for
home games have been unavaila-

Weinschenker photo
ble for two years. P
Pitt also figures to enter this
year’s recruiting wars with con-
siderably better fittings. includ-
ingbone feature that has been
absent in recent years--prestige.
The Eastern 8 doesn‘t have it. the
Big East oozes'it. especially to a
18-year-old k_id who’s always
dreamed of playing in Madison
Square Garden. Or the Syracuse
Carrier Dome. Or the Boston
Garden. Get the picture? Chip-
man does. and he loves what he
sees on the recruiting horizon.

Pitt‘s decision to leave the
Eastern 8 basketball league. veto
the proposed Eastern all-sports
league and join the Big East
Wednesday sent ripples through-
out Eastern collegiate athletic
circles. ii

Had anyone thought to attach

choice. they could‘ve seen the
effects graphically. T

While some members of the 

Eastern 8 openly voiced their‘
“disappointment" with Pitt’s
decision to jump ship for the Big
East. Paterno. who fancies him-
self the watchdog of the greater

trying hard not to seethe.

In one fell swoop. his brain-
child. the all-sports Eastern
league was pushed from the
brink offormation back tojust a
hazy. Happy Valley daydream.

Syracuse and Boston College.

Paterno. after first hearing of
Pitt‘s decision Wednesday. said
he was not upset. just “disap-

statement. he showed why he was
upset. '

- “We were willing to make
some sacrifices and”some contri-

the Panthers who. according to Pitt
Coach Jackie Sherrill. face their
most important contest of the sea-
son tomorrow at Veterans Stadium.

All that teeters on the line is a
major bowl bid. a cool. coveted S I .5
million and a potential national

Must Beat Temple

championship- three good reasons
Sherrill_has mentioned to his team.

“I told our players in the locker
room last Saturday that Temple is
now our most important game ofthe
year.“ Sherrill said. “There’s too
much hinging on it to take it for
granted." g

Temple. to be sure. will not be

taken for granted. As Pitt defensive V

tackle Bill Maas said. “We realize we
have a chance to win the national
championship. and we don’t want to
lose it. I think the team realizes what
we have to do."

One of the tasks of Pitt’s defense
will be to stop Temple’s potentially
explosive offense. manned by a trio
of “skill" players with some impres-
sive statistics.

Halfback .lim Brown has aver-

aged over I00 yards per game this
season and needs I29 yards rushing
against Pitt to hit |.000 this year; he
is averaging a robust 5.5 yards per
carry this season. Brown should be
working on some extra incentive
against -Pitt since Temple plays
just l() games. not the usual I I. this
will be his lastchanceto get his l.()O0
yards.

L_ewis Becomes 
Pitts All-time Scorer

By MARIE HUFF

Milestone accomplishments were
achieved Wednesday night as the
Lady Panther basketball team rolled
over the Lady.Falcons of Fairmont
State. 65-29. Senior sensation Deb-
bie Lewis sunk a laylup off a fast
break at the l4:39 mark in thefirst

L half to become the all—time leading

scorer in Lady Panther basketball
history. surpassing the prior record
set by Wanda Randolph. Lewis went
on to score 2l points in the game.
which was Coach Judy Saurer’s
200th career victory.

“This wasn’t a goal I set for
myself." said the 5‘-2" ball-
handling wizard, “I used to play with
Wanda Randolph when I first came
to Pitt. and it was fun to pass to her
and watch her score.“ V

Of her 200th victory. Saurer said.
“l‘ve been coaching for 17 years. the
last two at Pitt. and I still say the
most important game is every game.
You just take one gameiat a time.
and you try to win it. That‘s what
we’re doing right now."

Freshman Jennifer Bruce put in
four of the first five Lady Panther
buckets to give Pitt a l()-4 lead after
five minutes of play. Pitt extended
its lead to 25-9 with seven minutes
remaining in the half. andwthen held
the Lady Falcons scoreless for the
next six minutes to go to the locker
room with a 39-I5 lead.

The Lady Panthers offense goto‘
to a sluggish start in the second half.
and the Lady Falcons scored ten
unanswered points to come within
fourteen. 4|-27. Pitt then countered
the attack with an aggressive defense
and an intense press that held the
Fairmont State women to one
basket in the remaining eight min-
utes of the contest.

Gail Aughburns scored the final
shot at the buzzer. giving Pitt its first
win of the new season 65-29.

“We had our good moments."
said Saurer. “We didn’t have the
shooting game I wanted. and our
defense was weak at times. but we

won. We got those first game jitter}:

out of the way.“ '

Lewis led all scorers with 2l
points. Jennifer Bruce contributed
If» in the win. Aughburns played an
excellent all-around game. scoring
I0 points and grabbing 7 rebounds.
Aughburns also picked up seven
steals for the Panthers and blocked
six shots. Pam Miklasovich led Pitt
in the rebound column with ll.
Vicki Huffman led Fairmont State‘s
scorers with nine points.

Lady Spikers Open Regionals with AW‘

«.

By JOE KELLY

The Pitt Lady Panthers opened
the l98l EAIAW Regional Volley-
ball Championships with a sound
win over Providence, l5-l0 and 15-3
yesterday afternoon.

The victory put Pitt one game
closer to a berth in the AIAW Di-
vision I National Championships,
which will be held at Utah State in
December.

“We played good enough to win,
but we didn’t play really well,”
remarked Pitt coach Shelton Collier
after the Lady Panther victory. “We
want to win every game that we play,
so in that sense we achieved some-
thing this afternoon. However, we
will have to play much better if we
hope to win the regionals."

The Providence match was the
1 first of two played by Pitt on Thurs-
day, the second being against Tem-

a (left to right) Freshmen Chip Watkins, Andre Williams and

pie, a team which Collier feels has a
good chance of winning the tourna-
ment. “George Washington,
Rutgers, Georgetown, and Temple
are the teams to watch for, but we
don't count Providence, Maryland,
and Princeton out of it."

In other top volleyball action on
Thursday afternoon, No. l-ranked
Rutgers soundly defeated Princeton
l5-3 and I5-6, second-ranked
George Washington cruised past
Temple 15-3 and l5—3, and fourth-
ranked Maryland defeated George-
town in a close match, l5-I2 and
l6-I4.

As for his team’s outlook. Collier
said, “Volleyball is a sport full of
emotion. Very often teams win on
momentum. In a tournament such
as the regionals it is important for
the team to pace itself. They must be
ready to excel at the right moment.

that we have seen the best ofany yet.

“There is going to be some really
exciting volleyball when these teams
explode. The playoffs especially will
be hard—fought. If Pitt plays their
best, then we have the capability of
winning this tournament.”

The Lady Panthers are 3|-I3 on
the season.

Pool play will continue today with
Pitt facing a tough George Washing-
ton team at I l a.m. Quarterfinals are
scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. and 4

exhibition against an Austrialian National team.

Exhibition Key to Chipman

By AMIN GHOSSEIN
Itching for a chance to see his
young team perform, Pitt basketball
coach Roy Chipman finally gets that
chance tonight when his Panthers
ake on the Australian National

~-v i-{Team at 8 p.m. in Fitzgerald Field

House.

Having nothing but practice after
practice to gauge his players’ abili-
ties, the second-year coach is anx-
ious to see how his team. so young
and so inexperienced, will do in a
game situation. even though the
contest is just an exhibition.

To Chipman, tonight's game will

give him an opportunity to observe
and to experiment.

“A win would be nice, but I‘m
going to use a lot of players and see
how they perform in a game-type
situation,” Chipman said.

Tonight will also be Chipman’s
first chance to view his highly-touted
recruiting class in game action for
Pitt.

With the first regular-season
game only one week away and on the
road, Chipman is still unsure of his
starting lineup, but tonight's game
should help to clarify the situation.

“Right now my lineup is Dwayne

Wallace at point, Darrell Gissen-
danner at shooting guard, Clyde
Vaughn, Roosevelt Kirby and Steve
Beatty up front, but there is still a lot
of competition, and things can still
change," he said.

One thing has already changed for
Pitt basketball. With Wednesday’s
announcement that Pitt would drop
out of the Eastern 8 and join the
prestigious Big East Conference,
Pitt players and coaches were all
smiles.

Smiles were especially broad on
the players from New York, who

flanker Gerald “Sweetfeet” Lucear.
Lucear leads the team with 43
catches for 462 yards, while
Murphy, operating out -of a short-
to-intermediate zone passing attack,
has completed over 50 percent of his
passes this ye-airfor l,544 yards.
Temple is averaging 278 yards per
game passing.

Throw in a few Wayne Hardin
gimmick plays and “they‘re capable
of putting on a big show," according
to Maas.

Though much has been made of
the two weeks Temple has had to
prepare for Pitt. Hardin scoffed at
the idea that time has given the Owls
any advantage.

“Absolutely none. We could take
four or five months to prepare and
we still wouldn‘t have the advan-
tage," Hardin maintained.

The Owls try to create advantages
on defense by using an eight-man
front, varying their pass rush and
employing frequent blitzes.

Pitt has already faced an eight-
man front once this year, against
Cincinnati, and promptly shredded
the defense through the air.

Such an alignment places a team‘s
defensive backs in precarious man-
to-man coverage, a gambit that
more teams figure to win than lose
against the likes of Pitt's Julius
Dawkins, Barry Compton, John
Brown, and Dwight Collins, when
he is healthy.

Cincinnati, history proves, was no
exception. Pitt walloped the Bear-
cats 38-7.

With a quarterback such as Dan
Marino, who regained the nation’s*
No. l passing-efficiency rating this
week, it remains to be seen how long
Temple will stick with an eight-man
front. The decision will likely rest on
how well Pitt’s offensive line can
protect against the pass.

Success against the eight-ma_n
front also depends on a quarter-
back’s ability to read impending
coverages at the line and then, if
necessary, audibilize. Marino has
shown conclusively that he's as cap-
able of recognizing defenses as he is
at riddling them with completions.
At least Sherrill is optimistic that
‘this will hap_p_en tomorrow.

-“They (Temple) blitz an awful lot. .

I like when people line up and blitz
against us. I think we're good
enough to protect and get the
receiverin single coverage,” Sherrill
said. “Someone will be open.”

Hardin hopes not. And if man-on-
man coverage doesn’t work, he’s
counting on a bigger reservoir of
strength. _

“This country is built on the
underdog. And, if that's the case,
we'll have everybody in the country
rooting for us," he said.

Maybe. But the Panthers, with
their ears cocked toward a major
bowl invitation, don’t want to hear
it.

A n d wit h o ut
schools- namely Pitt. Syracuse
and Boston College-- there is no

chance of a new East league.

something Paterno sought espe-
.. cially rabidly. hoping to ease the
woes of an independent basket-

ball team that has resembled lit-'

tle more than a white elephant
and the burgeoning costs ofnon-
revenue sports program.
' Syracuse and Boston College.
both original Big East members.
had long balked at an all-sports
conference. which would mean
their defection from the demon-
strably profitable Big East.
Syracuse. especially. refused
to waver. and later the talks
among the seven prospective

_ -league’s schools--Pitt. Penn

State. Boston College. Temple.
Rutgers and West Virginia-
reached an impasse over sticky
issues like revenue sharing.
Enter Big East. which seven
weeks ago came knocking on
Pitt’s door. sensing an “in.” With
Syracuse and Boston College‘s
help. they got it. And got Pitt.
As Big East Commissioner
Dave Gavitt admitted Wednes-
day. Pitt's hasty adoption into
the fold was prompted as much

by a desire for Pitt as a longing to

“those"'

save his league‘s skin against the
loss of prestigious members like
Syracuse and Boston College.

"It was a defensive move. but
only in the timing." Gavitt
admitted. “We had been holding
conversations about expansion
almost in the first six months of
our existence. Pitt was No. l on
our list.

“But. candidly." Gavitt con-
tinued. “our timetable was
stepped up by the University of
Pittsburgh looking intothe other
league and two of our members
looking into other options for
their programs. We didn‘t feel it
was wise to wait a year." '

And so Pat'erno‘s juggernaut
must wait several years. at least.

“I felt an all-sports conference
was the right thing at the right
time for the East.” Paterno said.
“Pitt has to do what it thinks is
best for its program.” But...

‘‘It‘s a shame we lost an oppor-

.tunity for something the East has

never had- an all-inclusive. all-
sports league."

If there. is any shame. Pitt_

.doesn’t feel it. Neither does Bos-
ton College or the Big East. or
Syracuse. whose athletic director
Jake Crouthamel was in Pitts-
burgh Wednesday and on the
dais as Gavitt’s symbolic right-

hand man when Pitt's Big East .

announcement was made.

“Let me say. from the first day
we formed. it was never our
intention to lure or draw schools
away from another conference.”
Gavitt said Wednesday as a pre-

face to welcoming Pitt to his
league. Pitt becomes the second
addition. and second former
Eastern 8 team. to join the Big
East Villanova. in I980. was
the other.

Pitt’s Jack Freeman. senior
vice chancellor for public affairs.
then explained why Pitt decided
to make a thr'ee—year commit-
ment and not to wait for the new
league to solve its problems in
the shadow of the Big East‘s
“extremely attractive offer.“

“There were different prob-
lems posed by different members
of the proposed group.” Free-
man said. listing television cover-
age. revenue-sharing. scheduling
and travel problems as the stum-
bling blocks. I

Two members ofthe Eastern 8
and two other Eastern confer-
ence advocates. West Virginia
and Rutgers. expressed their
“disappointment" with Pitt's
decision. while others like
Duquesne’s Athletic Director
Red Manning say they see the

logic.

“It didn’t come as a complete
surprise. I knew they were leav-
ing for one of the leagues. I cer-
tainly wish them well." Manning
said. “There may be some back-'1
lash with the football people. I
got the feeling West Virginia
thought the football league was
imminent.”

“None of these decisions affect
our position as a major inde-
pendent.” Paterno said.

Joe wishes it weren’t so.

bit of a problem keeping the best

basketball players in the area."

Chipman said. “Our entrance
into the Big East is a challenge to
Western Pennsylvania athletes
to stay home and compete in one
of the'best conferences in the
East.” '

It‘s also a challenge to Pitt to
keep up with the rest of the
league. The Panthers. currently
in a rebuilding stage with four
new starters and six new team
members this year. figure to take
their lumps in their maiden sea-
son. at least. in the Big East.
Chipman went to great lengths to
admit as much at Wednesdays
press conference.

“It isn‘t going to happen over-
night. lt‘s'a big step for us. We
lost a lot ofplayers and we have a
lot of younger players this year.
But we're going into the’Bi_g East
at a good time. and. with a cou-
ple of good recruiting years
(being in) the Big East will help
us have....” -

He didn’t have to finish. Chip-
man had already revealed his
feelings about thejump up tothe

Big East earlier: “This (l2l_\' is one
of the most important days in the
history of our basketball
program."

Actually. the most important
day came two days earlier when
the official invitation to join the
Big East came from Gavitt Mon-
day. It ended six months ofnego-
tiations that accelerated in the
last month and a halfof confer-
ence calls.and shuttle diplomacy
involving Pitt officials and
Gavitt. Pitt took just one day to i
say yes after spending months
wrangling with the issues around
the proposed Eastern'all—sports
league.

“It represented an opportunity
simply too good to pass up,“ said
Jack Freeman. who is Pitt senior
vice chancellor for public affairs.
and a powerful man when it
comes to heavy decision—making
about Pitt’s athletic affairs.

Or. as Gavitt put it. “We can
provide Pitt with a vehicle to
reach the same lofty goals in bas-
ketball as in football.” ‘

Author's note: Mickey Tho-
mas, lead singer for Iefferson
Starship, has a list of credits that
most singers would he proud of. I
Past conquestsinclude the Elvin
Bishop Band {he sang on'the
Strutting My Stuff album),
Power (a gospel unit fronted by
Gideon), and numerous no-
name projects. Thomas is now
secure in his job as lead vocalist
for Starshipand his solo career is
in the early stages. On Friday,
Novemher 6, I talked to Mickey
about his solo effort, fefferson
Starship, and his personal,feel-
ings on various other subjects.

Our conversation
started on Alive Alone,
Mickey's solo album on the
Electra label. "It's defi-
nitely rock and roll, but it's
less hard-edged. There are
less" effects, sparser pro-
duction, and the album is
. more vocally-oriented."
 The solo album isn't on the

f charts, but there is still

By GEORGE HOLZER

hope; as Mickey put it,
"The jury is still out.”
We then turned to the

feelings of touringwith

and being a member of the
Jefferson Starship, Mickey

said seriously, "It's a lot of

fun. There's a little pres-
sure to try to give a great
performance every night;
the people expect that. It's
hard to be your best every
time, but when things are
going well, I really enjoy
it."

Mickey then told me
about the first album and
tour. "Putting Freedom At
Point Zero together was
pretty easy; we had done a

lot of rehearsing so it all .

fell into place. The tour
was pretty easy also. The
older stuff, a lot of it, was
group sing-a—longs. So
Paul Kantner,‘ David (Frei-
berg), and myself did a lot
of those. But, I never
viewed myself as trying to
replace anyone, or filling
anyone else's shoes. I...we
considered it as new
band."

We then moved on to
the Modern Times tour and,
of course, the addition of
Grace Slick. Mickey had a
good .deal to say. "When
Grace joined, that made
me feel real good. I was
real happy; not many guys
get the chance to sing
along—side Grace Slick. It's
easier now that she's back.
It feels more complete; it's
like she's where she should
be. She's_ also probably the
biggest reason the attend-
ance is up at the concerts."

I asked if there was any
question of job security.
Mickey told me, "No, no.
There was never any ques-
tion of that."

The next subject was
the song "Stairway To
Cleveland." This is a per-

sonal favorite from Modern '

Times. The song has. a
strong message,.part of it
aimed directly at the Rea-
gan administration. Mick-
ey's comments took me
partially by surprise.
”Yeah, "Stairway' is about
the band and its feelings.

It's over-exaggerated; that .

 

Iefferson Starship/Solo Artist Mickey Thomas.

was to get the point across.
The point is this: Don't let
your life be governed by
people who are always tell-
ing you what to do. We
refuse to accept all ‘this
insanity in the world. We
disagreed with some of the
government decisions.
We're trying to make peo-

ple think, instead of being‘

blindly led along like

~ sheep/'

I commented that this
sounded like the sixties, to

I which ‘Mickey shot back, "I

think Ronald Reagan will
bring back the sixties. This

is the first time in a long.

time we have something to
protest against. I think

"Reagan being elected is

probably the most tragic
thing ever to happen to

this country. It still baffles I

my mind. I think we have
to get Ronny and the boys
out of there as soon as
possible."

I steered away from this
and brought the interview
to a close by asking Mick-
ey's view of the rock press.
He answered as most rock
performers do by saying,
"You get both good. and
bad. If you pay attention to
the good, you've got to
listen to. the bad. Person-
ally, I ignore all the
reviews." ‘

I said good-bye; and, as I
walked away I was sure
that Mickey Thomas’ suc-
cess hadn't gone to his
head. I hope that his
efforts, both with Jeffer-
son Starship and as a solo
artist, work out for the
best. He deserves it.‘

—Do you love your movies to be

If the answer to any of the above is
yes then you are just the person the
producers of The Pursuit of DB. Cooper
have been looking for.

D.B. Cooper was the man who ten
years ago jumped out of a plane over

' the Grand Tetons with $200,000 of

the airlines’ money never to be seen
or heard from again, thus becoming
the ultimate good ole boy hero, the

By GLENN FERGUSON

We have had plenty of statements
on Vietnam in films of the past few

‘ years and now we have Walter Hill's
statement, or attempt at a statement,‘

on the subject in Southern Comfort. But
what is different about this film is
that we never see Vietnam, nor do
any of the characters in the film. In
fact, Vietnam isn't even mentioned.
Instead, Hill gives us weekend sold-
iers, National Guardsmen carrying
out an exercise in the Louisiana
swamps. And instead of Vietnam

guerrillas, we get a band of Cajun)

hillbillies who inhabit the territory.

Problems arise when the small
group of guardsmen encounter a lake
that isn't on the map. Thereis no way

for them to get around this lake so .

they must steal a few boats from the
Cajun in order to arrive at their des-
tination on time. When the Cajun
discover the boats missing they
become angry and this anger deepens
when one of the soldiers fires blanks
at them. The Cajun then proceed to
pick off the guardsmen one by one
in various gruesome ways.

The parallels to Vietnam become
obvious as the film progresses. These
are young and inexperienced soldiers

‘thrusted into a strange territory
where they face a foe that they can-
not see or predict. But whatever
. statement Hill might havebeen try-

ing to make becomes lost. The plot-

  
   
 

. line becomes nothing more than an
excuselfor displaying various ways of
killing a human being. 
No suspense develops from the
soldiers predicament.‘ It becomes

  

‘A

Carlos Brown, Lewis Smith,

Franklyn Seales  Powers Boothe

  will be killed. The only thing we

don't know is how they will be killed,
but you can be certain it will be in
some gruesome and explicitly ren-
dered manner. ’
There are two soldiers (Keith Car-

-5- K ........    .~._  , _.,§*(~: -‘Q

  
  

  

radine and Powers Boothe), the only
two with common sense, who

developba. sort of comradeship and}

predictably they are the only two to
survive the ordeal. But these charac-
ters,.as well as the others, are hollow
and unsubstantial. One of them
becomes mentally unstable at the
beginnning of the ordeal, but we
have no idea what caused it. Like-
wise, we do not know why any of the
other characters react the waythey
do in certainpsituations. We never get’
to know them andtherefore we can-
not care for them. It does not affect
us emotionally at all when one of

them, is killed.

This film has often been compared “ ’

to Di'lim'rmm' for, indeed, it is based on’
the same sort of situation. But Soul}:-

mi Comfort does not have any of the
suspense or unpredicability of Delia’
vrmu‘x'. It is no way on the same par.

Thereis one good thing about this
film tHough—-Ry Cooder's music. It
‘is eeryand hauntingland very effec-
tive. The photography and direction
are also done well. Hill has displayed
a talent for directing adventure in
previouslfilms such as The l-Vm'rior~’

an_d Tlli’ Long l{lilt’r‘5. But neither 

these films had any substantial char-
acters in them either. A little bit of
characterization in Hill's next film
would be good advice.

because Marlow and his close cam-
panion George Hastings (Douglas
Krizner) have been duped by the
house's mischief maker, Tony Lump-
kin (Tom Medicino), into believing
the Hardcastle home is nothing more
than an inn, Marlow becomes more
and more confused about where he is
and what is going on around him.
 The asides that _ Kate's father
1 (played by Alex Coleman) gives to the
audience as young Marlow mistakes
his future father~in—law for an
innkeeper are gracefully carried off.
The performances by Tom.Medicino

as Lumpkin, Alex Coleman as Mr."

Hardcastle as well as the wit and
charm of Tammy Bouzos as Kate,
Maria Barney as Katefs best friend,
David Kuhns as Marlow, and Dou-
glas Krizner as his sidekick all con-
tribute greatly to the success of this
production. ’
Elaborate costumes, sharp scenery,
/A,“ and the-frivolous servants and pub‘
is ‘roustabouts are also admirable. The
frantic action between scenes is per-
haps a little exaggerated and, at
times, very annoying to watch, yet
V the action works in much the same
way the three witches in Shakes-
peare's MacBeth worked: to prepare
the audience for the next set of cir-
cumstances and perils with just a hint
of what to expect.

a like watching Sarah Bernhardt in a

unnatural and in fact, "downright

In all fairness, Thomas Babe's
script does not provide much inspira-

pointless, rambling monologues, and

are almost totally without interest.

The scenes change with very sim-
ple placing of props, and lighting.
tage crew for this playiwere dressed
in ”native" attire: barefoot in most
cases, culminating with a tribal dance
that helped offer more in the way of
setting in a very short period of time.
There are no intermissions in the 90-
minute production, and just as the
tension builds to exceedingly hot
heights, humor or a cooling off period
between characters serves as release
instead of the curtain. In the final
analysis, this play about apartheid is
not really a ranting, raving angry ser-
mon, rather, an entertaining conver-
sation, a dialogue delivered to expose
the hostility and fatalism which so
many black South Africans carry

. . around with them everyday. It's well

worth seeing, if just for the anger
expressed by Bansi when he roars
that he is a man. it is a believable cry
for justice against injustice as per-
formed by this strong triumvirate
formed between McElroy, Wana-
maker, and Chambers.

Tom'Petty appeared here in

Pittsburgh this past August. I *

had seen him ayear before at

"the Stanley and he -and the.
L Heartbreakers peeled the paint?
‘off therwalls. Before this latest , i

show, -I hear that Joe. Ely is the

i ' opening act. Never heard of him

but Ifigure, not to worry, a

repeat performance by ' Petty -

insures the night a success.The

I showstarts and Ely comesout

with his pants shoved inside his
bootssand I'm thinking anyone
who comesout in front of 8,000
city rats (with their pants
shoved inside their boots has
got to be cool. ‘Ely proceeds to
deliver a spastic performance
which only myself and maybe
three others inthe house appre-
ciate. Petty comes out and does
/an hour and one-half of "look
what success will do to you" and
everyone loves it. Confused and
yet re-affirmed, I am ‘happy to
escape the collectionvof pre-

pubescent monkeys who were:

, in attendance to, as usual, get
stoned, walk around saying
"really," and hope that a concert
might break out.

Suddenly I am a Ioe Ely fan
and no one understands or even
cares why! This is. yet another

example of the failure of Amer- I

ica‘s white youth to support an

ethostof any substance. Instead
r they continue to wait on ideas
once used and now disposed by
[blacks or as in this situation,
they let the "blahey” boys in,

England do the hard work. You

see, Ely has gotten respect in  I

England, not to mention air-
play, and an "Album of the
Year” award. Conversely, here
in Pittsburgh, our self-
proclaimed effort at progres-
sive radio, WDVE, has never
heard of Joe Ely.

Ely's problem is that helooks,
sounds, and IS Texan. Sadly,
too many of the east-Coast's
music appreciados consider
themselves too hip and too
addicted to the newness or
extremeness of an idea to look
past, or through their wrap-
arounds long enough to
accomplish anything. Quality
is no longer a determinent; too
many have forgotten the ideals

V and thepurpose behind rock’n

roll. It's people like Joe Ely that
remind us. So take off your silly
disguises and listen up!

SHOWCASE: How about sim-
ingoff with some background

' on yourself. *

ELY: Iwas born in the panhan-

dle of Texas, in Amarillo, raised

in Lubbock, ‘Texas. I couldn't
make it through high school; I

By Todd Erlcel

was in a band in high school, so ‘

we hit the road, played around
Texas and then started wander-
ing coast-to-coast, joined the
Ringling Brother's Circus for a
while, then came back to Lub-
bock and started making
records. That's it in a nutshell.
SHOWCASE: This was during
the sixties; were the things we
now associate with that time-
the drugs, the protests—~were
they evident in Texas? .
ELY: It was the late sixties, but
no, those things weren't really
evident. Where I grew up it's
mostly cotton farms, so people
weren't really confronted with
all that. But I was doing some
heavy travelling then, and I
would hit New York City and

spend 6 or 8 months there then»

hit San Francisco or L.A., sol
would see both coasts and all of
middle-America and there is

always a,, difference between

them. , pi , ‘
SHOWCASE: ‘Where there any

influences on your music from

that time spent on the coasts?
ELY: I can't say any one person,

It ' Vs»     "'i‘--ﬂm‘   .
STRAIGHTFROM   THE '01-‘ TEXAS

but probably allot of people did.
Especially New York City, just
from hanging out in the night
spots, mostly down in ‘ the
Village. A

SHOWCASE: What about
black music, was that an
influence? 6

ELY: I was always influenced  W

black’ music. 
SHOWCASE: Did that _ ever
present a conflict being‘from
the South? , '
ELY: No that never was a con-
flict in fact I think black music
was universally accepted in the
South. People like Bob Wills
were influenced by black‘ music
and Hank Williams. But there
were things when I was_grow-

L ing up that were a real dichot-

omy to me, like water fountains
in Sears stores labelled "black"

g and "white" and I remember I
would go up and taste the water“ . 
in each one to see if it tasted“  3'

different.
SHOWCASE: Do you find your

_music difficult to categorize?

ELY: I don't find it difficult to
categorize it at all, but other
people do simply because it
doesn't fall neatly into the for-
mats of radio stations. I never
had geared my music toward

» what radio stations are playing,

I've geared it toward my taste
and my influences.,gAmarillo

way to 

SHOWCASE: Did those coun-
try influences include the
whole Nashville scene?

A ELY: Yeah, in the mid-seventies
ljthought that country music, ‘

during that time when Waylon
and Willie were first getting

‘recognized, was some of the
. most exciting music. I felt the

rock stuff had completely
becomea hybrid and lost direc-
tion music and nothing moved
me in that field. So Nashville
‘seemed real interesting to me
until l recorded two albums
there and kind of saw the whole
Nashville world and I realized l

__ didn't fit into that world either.

lt's a real hard,-core, main-
stream world. _
SHOWCASE: What about
country music today, .do.you
think it too has lost its course?
ELY: Yes, l really do. l think it
has LONG lost its course! lt’s
gone "uptown." You can't turn
your damn television on with-
out seeing someone up there
singing about satin sheets’ and
glitter all over the place. Coun-
try music to me represented the
plight of the working man and
no_w it's talking about Cadillacs
and limousines. l can't see any-
thing vital in that. A
SHOWCASE: ls there much of
a transition for you between
the studio and performing?
ELY: I used to hate the studio
because l felt it was confining
and I didn't feel the energy was
there. But lately I have learned
to work with the studio and the
things you can do there but
can't do live.

SH()lN’CASl'L: The live album

in .’..";. /in *~J':u:~. was done while

you were touring with the

Clash: how did that all come
about? ’

ELY: We were playing over in

England in '79 and Joe

. Strum mer and Mick Jones came

backstage after a gig in London.
l wasreally surprised that they
knew all my songs because they

were asking why didn't you
play this or that. They were fix- '

ing to come over to -America to

do the tour before they did f.Ill1"'

dun Calling and Texas was going
to be one of the places they were
going to, so we got together and
did all the dates there and the
ones in California.

Right after the tour here, The

Clash brought us over to Eng-_

land for the "London Calling”
tour there and then after that

we did a couple of weeks on our ‘
own. We had decided to lay

down some tracks while we
were over there, but MCA in
the states thought it was a terri-
ble‘ idea so we went to MCA in
England and they backed us all
the way!

. SHOWCASE: How were you .
» received over in England?

ELY: Well we had been over
there in '78 and twice in '79 and
we have alwaystbeen received
well in England. The first
album we didcalled ."\lt’lmly

..\1z11u'r was a big hit there. ln
fact, it made Record Of The_

Year there.
SHOWCASE: You‘ appeared

 llInamn-----

here in Pittsburgh recently
opening for Tom Petty. How
didthat come about?. _ _
ELY: We were playing some
dates out in LA: and some of
l’etty’s people‘ saw us and

‘approached us" about doing

some of the dates that they had
planned. So after’ we were fin-
ished with our own swing out
west we’ ended up doing the
northeastern dates with them
and (we) just got done doing th

southern dates. ‘

crowd was OUR crowd. l felt

was a little hard to get through

LAW AND ORDER _
Lindsay Buckingham
Electra Asylum

I used to think Lindsay Buck-
ingham was innovative——even
brilliant, but that's all changed
now. It s.eems that his Fleet-
wood penguin suit has some-
how cut off the air supply to his
creativity making Buckingham
just another casualty/member

. of the "LA. Mafia" (Move over

Henley, Frey, Felder, and
Walsh)". _

When Buckingham Nicks
(Stevie and Lindsay) merged
with Fleetwood Mac during the
early seventies the effects
would not surface for several
albums. Bob Welch had just left,
leaving some of his best work
behind (Bare Trees, Heroes...) and
no one knew what.to expect.

" Fleetwood Mac was released and

people started to listen-with
all those melody hooks who
couldn't? Rumours had an
unbearable amount of the same
polish but the albumcame off
more like waxy buildup (even
though it's still unmercifully
played on the radio).

Back To The Drawing Board...

Then cameTusk and it was the
best thing that hit Fleetwood
Mac since Peter Green. It was

still polished but it was fresh,_

innovative and addictively
offbeat. Most of the credit for
Tusk was placed on Buckingham
and everyone said "I knew it."
During the Tusk tour the Mac

' was boring as hell—except for

Lindsay Buckingham. He was
energetic, unpredictable, and
even on stage—innovative«.
That's when everyone started
saying "I told you so.”

With Law am10riiereveryone's
just mumbling. Some are prais-
ing it; some say it's tongue-in-
cheek....l think it's insane.

A first glance at the lyrics
sheet may evoke a, "Oh, he's
trying to write like Garland Jef-
freys now," from the cerebrum,
but upon listening to the album
that assumption is quickly
proved wrong. The lyrics carry
nowhere near the intensity of
]effreys' and are about as insipid
as luke-warm water. The music
is just as generic and tends to
leave no impression whatsoever
on the listenener. The end
result is very disappointing and

   

V LINDSAY BUCKINGHAM

has approximately the same
impact as the fuzzy snow on the
TV set after the "Star—Spangled
Banner" and "Sermonette."
This album is, well, for
nobody. Fleetwood Mac fans
might want to try it, but they'll
probably never listen to it
again.The only mentionable cut
on the album is "That's How We
Do It in L.A." and after this

albﬁTdor,1'twhaT_t_oknow any-
more. Really kids, this one
should be titled "Songs From
the Garbage."

Ah but don't give up hope too
soon. Lindsay may still pull a
fast one with the next Fleet-
wood Mac project. If not, well,
then we'll just blame it on Stevie
Nicks...

BLITZ
Various Artists
RCA

There are so many great
songs on this sampler by so
many great bands, and it would
take so long to talk at length
about all of them (though many
are worthy of this dubious
honor), so, a short description
of the album's highlights will
have to be sufficient.
1) "Chihuahua"—-This song is
by Bow Wow Wow, Malcolm
McLaren’s (the man behind the
Sex Pistols) latest trend—setting
prodigies. But don't let the hype
surrounding Bow Wow Wow—
mainly that their lead singer,
Annabella Lwin, is a 15 year-old

Burmese refugee who McLaren
discovered in an English
laundromat—keep you from lis-
tening to them. "Chihuahua" is
a great song complete with silly
lyrics, tribal drums, semi-
classical guitars, and the cute-
tough vocals of Annabella
which pull it all together
beautifully.

2) "Spring In Fialta"—This song
is vaguely political, but its fast
pace keeps you too busy dancing
to have time to think about deep
meanings. A female singer (Pal
Shazar) fronts this band knows
as Slow Children, but there's
nothing "slow" about them.

3) "White Noise" and "Call The

Uh-Oh Squad"—-—Both of these
numbers are by someone named
Robert Ellis Orrall, and though
he's unknown now, my_bet is
that he won't be for long. His
music's powerful, loud, and
very catchy. "White Noise" has
the potential to be a killer single.

4) "Tips For Teens"—By the
veteran brother band called
Sparks, "Tips For Teens"
achieves that eccentric pop-
operatic style that Queen only
grasps at. And besides, Russell
Mael can hit higher notes than
Freddie-poo Mercury can——so
there!

There's other songs/bands on
BIitz—Shock, Landscape, and
Polyrock—that are good, but
not on the same level as the
above. It doesn't matter,
though, because there's enough
good material here to make it a
"must" record for those who
have the need to listen to super-
ior music.

DREAMTIME
Tom Verlaine
Warner Brothers

Tom Verlaine, guitarist. Tom
Verlaine, songwriter. Tom Ver-
laine, founder of the now-
defunct post—punk group
Television. He wrote "Kingdom
Come" for David Bowie's
haunting Scary Monsters and Super
Creeps lp. Verlaine is a cult hero,
no doubt for all his weirdness
musically and otherwise. Thing
is, his album Drenmlime is per-
haps the most fitting example of
how a small cult hero can draw a
larger cult following. He suc-
ceeds in presenting himself as a
big cult hero here.

Verlaine. The name is so
poetic. Many critics point out
that just as he sings into his

chest on most‘ of the songs

offered here, the mystery of

garbled words and phrases con-
tributes to the melodies and
harsh dirge—like post-new wave

material that, seems to more
often than not, just lay there on
the tracks.

There are very few things
that stand out on the album for
wider audiences. Each track

' gives us a new twist or wide-

open-spaces textures from Ver-
laine's guitars that make
listeners think, 'Hey that's
really sharp.’ But when the next
track "comes on there is very lit-
tle difference in composition, so

‘one track seems to sound like V 
another. Too bad. "Penetra— 

tion," "There's A Reason," and
"Fragile," all have guitar styl-
ings similar to Hendrix and Led
Zepplin's Jimmy Page. Even
bluesy riffs combining King
Crimson's Robert Fripp and
B.B. King, with fiery chords and
lean mid-range lines on solos,
take on a persona all their own.
The damage is done when this
man tries to sing along with his
music. Sameness doesn't hurt
Joni Mitchell, but it nearly kills
Verlaine. The album's only
instrumental, "The Blue Robe"
works fine; it picks and grins
with a heavy blues bass line that
walks, that marches. In con-
trast, there's a tune which hints
of suicide, reminiscent of '50's
and '60's rockabilly ("Without A
Word"), which makes one wish
that this album had been done
with lesssinging and more mid-
tempo danceable ditties, dark
and more daring than the B—52's
would ever attempt.

When the last song on the
first side fades with Verlaine

"singing" in his creaky, irritat- 

ing voice, "Without a u>ord/without
n word/zoithouf a word..."you wish
most of the songs had been.

EAST SIDE STORY
Squeeze
A&M

Pop music has its own philo-
sophy. Don't demand too mu.ch
from it, and it can be completely
satisfying. East Sia'e Story, the
latest release from Squeeze, is
just that: good pop music with
nogpretentions.

You won't find any political
statements here; surviving this
week's fight with your boy-
friend/girlfriend is s‘ubject mat-
ter enough. Within this
framework, East Side Story offers
quick glimpses of everyday life,
no strings attached. It's not
necessary to understand all the
words, the point is to enjoy the
simplicity of the songs.

Co-produced by Elvis Cos-
tello, this is an -album full of

potential singles. ”In Quintes— l

sence" and the rockabilly—ish
”Messed Around” are two good
examples. "Tempted," the’
record's best song, offers some
vocal trade-offs between key-
boardist Paul Carrack, Glenn
Tilbrook and Elvis C. It's inter-
esting, refreshing, and totally

‘ addicting.

Sure, you'd die a quick death
if pop were the only music on
earth, but taken as an alterna-
tive once in awhile it feels fine.
Don't be too intellectual for East
Side Story. It'll be your loss.

GREATEST HIT
Queen ‘
Elektra

Greatest hits albums don't
leave much to say. Everybody

‘has heard most of the tunes on

the disc, sothey can make their
own decision to buy or not to
buy. Queen's Greatest Hits is no
exception. ”Under Pressure" is
the only new song on the album.
A collaboration between Queen
and David Bowie, "Pressure"
has a heavy base line (a la
"Another One Bites The Dust,"
also on the album) and
extremely weak vocals'(Bowie's

voice is lost under the chorus);

Favorites on the fourteeh—song
disc include ”Killer Queen,"
"Bicycle Race," "Fat Bottomed
Girls," and "Keep Yourself
Alive." To those of you who
don't have any Queen albums
and like Top Forty program-
ming, this album is a must; the
rest of you will make up your
own minds.

ENT SEX
Au Pairs

‘ Human Records

Two things make Bir-
mingham my favorite musical
birthplace in England: The Eng-
lish Beat and The Au Pairs. The
Au Pairs’-debut album, Playing
With A Different Sex, breaks new
ground for American listeners
searching through the vast Brit-
ish collection of post—puﬁl< crea-
tivity. Like the English Beat, the
Au Pairs make you want to get
up and dance, but the sensation
is complicated by the powerful
delivery of the vocal tracks. This
combination immediately
embodies both the sensory and
motor aspects, robbing the con-
trols from the unwary listener.

The bass line (Jane Munro) is

. awesome; more than a back-.

bone it seems, to replace the

1 ‘Ti
I. ‘\
.

absence of a lead guitar. Lesley
Woods, lead singer and guita-
rist, combines her talents with
guitarist Paul-Foad proving the
limitless versatility of a well bal-
anced guitar line—up. The two
guitars sear in and out, neither
one dominating the other, but
each complimenting the finely
executed bass line.

This even—gendered band
equally shares the vocal respon-
sibilities. Although Lesley, as
expressionistic as Chrissie
Hynde, delivers the lead vocals,
the use of harmony and
counter—melody by the other
members heighten the intensity
of each song. You have to hear
the result. "Armagh" is a good
example of how these qualities
are blended into a powerful
vocal display of human compas-
sion. Listen to the ending.
"Unfinished Business" has sort
of a funky beat and proves the
danceability of this group.

You may have to travel as far
as Squirrel Hill or Bloomfield to
find this imported album, but
the sacrifice will be worth it.

ANGING HEARTS
-Polyrock
RCA ‘

The publicity blurb for this

A band , stresses Polyrock's

"danceable" qualities. And sure‘
enough, you can move your feet
and body to most of the stuff on
Changing Hearts, but it does
nothing for your-head.
Polyrock's music is based on
repetition and minimalism—it
lulls you into a strange state of
consciousness, one which can be
very pleasant if you just want to
blank out the rest ofthe world.

, No one song especially stands

out here, in fact, the problem is
that they all seem to run
together in an unfocusable blur.
(If you can distinquish Side A
from Side B you ought to win a
prize.)

Changing Hearts isn't a bad

.album, just monotonous. A

good purpose for it would be to
brainwash people—lock 'em in a
room and pipe this in for a cou-
ple of hours and——pfft!—instant
zombies! Besides, if you want
lulling rhythms done up in an
electronic style, Duran Duran

does it better.

DISCIPLINE
King Crimson -

. Warner Brothers

After seven years of various
slol explorations and collabora-
tions with Brian Eno and The
League of Gentlemen, Robert
Fripp has finally reformed the
legendary King Crimson. Bill
Bruford is backon drums or, as
the album puts it, "batterie.”
The newest members of the
band are Adrian Belew on vocals
and guitar, and Tony Levin who .
plays the stick and suppies the
basswork.

Side one closes with "Indisci—_
pline," in which the protagonist
develops a strange attraction to
some unidentified object. He
carries it around for days and
tries not to look at it, yet still
finds himself irresistibly drawn
to it. Side two conversely closes

with "Discipline" in which
Fripp’s meticulously con-
structed circular patterns are

‘interwoven with complemen-

tary runs from Belew and Levin.
The sound is tight, disciplined,
and distinctly Fripp. Between
these two songs, the other five,
and the quote on the back cover,
is probably some hidden theme
on discipline, but I must confess

' that it escapes me. The music,

however, is so good that I

"For You" and

"They Came Crawling”
‘Carsickness

T.M.I.

Listening to this, it's easy to
understand why Carsickness is
Pittsburgh's favorite under-
ground band. The music's an
undefinable barrage of fusion:
pop crossed with folk crossed
with electronic crossed with
reggae crossed with heavy
metal crossed with...’well, you
get thepicture. What's so amaz-
ing is that this hodge-podge of
styles doesn't come out sound-
ing"messy,- in fact, Carsickness
sounds downright smoth, but
not smacking of the slickness
that mars so many of today's
newer groups. A

"For You" and "They Came

Crawling" are totally different, '

yet the same jue to the undenia-
ble Carsickness musical scrawl
written all over, notably, the
singer's style. Karl's voice has
that rare quality of being ableto

. sound raw-emotional one min-

ute and dead-mechanical the
next, which gives thelsongs a
sort of schizophrenic feel.

This single is definitely worth
buying, both for the reasons
listed above, and because it's so
much better than at least 75
percent of the other garbage

I presently churned out on vinyl.

t"For' You"/"They Came Cra-
wling" should be available, along with
other Carsickness material, at
National Record Mart, ]im's, and

Heads Together in a few days.)

IEFI-‘ERSON STARSHIP/RED
RIDER

Stanley Theater

November 3, 1981

By GEORGE HOLZER

The anticipation of seeing one
o.f rock and roll’s true legends
overshadowed almost every-
thing on this night. The legend
was Grace Slick, singing with
the Starship. The legend lived’
up to all expectations. V
The concert started strong
and hardly let down all evening.
Opening the set were "Some—
body To Love" and "Ride The
Tiger," a brave move that could
have been fatal for a less power— 
ful band. These two songs were
the perfect choice, though, for a
band like Starship. The tunes
got the SRO crowd on their feet
and rushing the stage, but the
Stanley Theatre security force
got everyone back to their pla-
' ces and the concert continued.
The band Twas extremely
tight. Sli'ck's voice blended well
with that of Mickey Thomas,
Starship's lead vocalist since the
Freedom /it Point Zero. album.
Aynsley Dunbar and Pete Sears
‘ laid down a solid rhythm with
great work on drums and base
guitar. Craig Chaquico and
David Freiberg added fine gui-
tar and keyboard performances.
Lastly, Paul Kantner seemed at
home, whether singing, playing

I--jefferson starship—-I

guitar.

Most of Starship's material

was from the /\/iozlern Times and

Frmlom albums, but enough

older material was thrown in to
satisfy the fans from the days of ‘

Real Octopus, and even I. Airplane.

.2 Best songs of the set were
"Somebody To Love," ”Ride
The Tiger," "Jane," "Find Your

Way Back," and "Stairway To

Cleveland." The only musical
lull came when the band slowed
down to do Elvin Bishop's
"Fooled Around And Fell In

Love" (which Thomas originally
recorded with Bishop's band).
The two encores were "White
Rabbit," which had Slick singing
solo, and a whipped-up version
of "Rock Music.”

Starship's performance did

-have two flaws, though. One

was the volume, which was
much too loud for a hall the size
of the‘ Stanley. The other flaw
was the lack of Marty Balin

material; but then, I wonder ifit

would have been the same with-
out Balin.

The opening act, Red Rider,
didn't impress me at all. Rock
and roll didn't come naturally to
them; they were obviously
working, andtit took away from
their performance. What Ithink
they should work on is being

Wmore at ease.

/By the end of the evening,.I
was sure of one thing: the
legend lives on, as Grace Slick

and Jefferson Starship rock on. S

RICK SPRINGFIELDI
ROBBER’S ROOST
Stanley Theater
November 7, 1981

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

Poor Robber's Roost, they
couldn't do anything right.
Every time they’d,end a song, a
"million (it sounded likeja million
anyway) squeaky teeny-bopper
voices would erupt in chants of
"We want Rick!” that wouldn't
stop until the next number
drowned them out or their par-
ents told them to shut up.
Which was a shame, because
Robber's ‘Roost is a good band,
especially if you like country
music in the vein of Charlie
Daniels or the Outlaws; But the
audience, though there were a
few scattered fans, would do
nothing more than politely clap
at a song's finish before the
"Rick" chants began again. So
much for_ fairness.

all the kiddies ran out to the
lobby for popeorn and Coke, or,
if they wore lots of make-up or
had premature facial hair, plus a
fake l.D., they drank beer
instead. Actually it seemed like
more parents than kids were
chugging alcohol; an attempt to
escape this adolescent night-
mare perhaps? (Imagine 3000
pre-fabs wearing shirts that
said things like. ”I Want To Be
Rick's Girl" and screaming

‘ every time the curtains moved.)
And who ever said that parents
were dumb...

After R.R.'s set was finished, A

rick springfield——-I B

By the time Rick Springfield

0 bounced on stage, thejkiddies'

blood sugar levels had risen con-
siderably, as evidenced by their
somewhat odd, and amusing,
behavior. They screamed,
swooned, threwclothes on to
the stage, (training bras?), blew
kisses, waved roses, and I swear
this happened, one girl even
fainted in adoration!

And was the performer

/‘ worthy of all this commotion?

No, but you have to admire
someone who can take all of this
fuss and still appear to be sin-
cere. Not that Springfield's a
bad performer—on the con-
trary, for what he does, he's
quite good. He knows how to
work his crowd (he even man-
aged to get them to stop scream-
-ing for an entire song!) and he
does so energetically, enthusi-
astically, and with a good sense
of humor; he even did a self-
mocking song, "She Called Me
Bruce," about the similarity
(between his own name and you-
know—who’s.
Yeah, Springfield's a "bubble-

gum" rocker so to speak; but he_

did record "Jessie's Girl," which
is one of the best all-time pop
songs, destined to become a

classic, he does work hard '

(besides singing, he's also a cast
member of General Hospital), and
he does seem to be a truly nice
person. It's just that one tends
to emerge from one of his con-
certs hating the entire popula-

tion of under-16 year olds, and

somewhat deaf...

TOM VERLAINEISVTI
CARSICKNESS
CMU-Sikbo Hall
November 8,1981 ’ .

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

Not many of music's rare cult

heroes ever come to this town, 1

so when Torn Verlaine and his
band came to CMU, the Pitts-
burgh underground was ready.

Oakland's boys—about-town, .

Carsickness opened the show
with their usual rousing set that
got the sold—out crowd on its
feet and dancing in a matter of

’ minutes. (For a review oftheir latest

single, "see page 11.)
SVT,’a trio composed of guit-
arist, bassist and drummer, fol-

lowed’ with a powerful‘

aggressive style, as musically

economic as the Police's.i

Though the crowd had a few

‘ rude—types in its midst (scat-

tered boos as they warmed up),
SVT soon won them over. Their
music was tight and clean and
their‘playing was inspired--
nothing sloppy here. A rela-
tively unknown band (the only
"name" member is Jack Cas‘-_
sady, former member of Jeffer-
son Airplane, Hot Tuna,et al.)
with only one album to their
credit, I can't tell you much
about them, just that they're
good and if you ever get the
chance to see them, don't pass it
up.

I'd like to say that the best was
saved for last, but it wasn't.

Which isn't to say that Verlaine
was bad, just a trifle disappoint.-
ing. Those of us who had
admired him from afar and
turned. him into a bigger than
life hero after we heard Televi-
sion, especially Marquee Moon,
found out that he's a human
‘being, albeit a talented one, with
imperfections like the rest of us.
But the crowd was facile, and
he unwittingly had them
wrapped around his pinkie from
the start. He played old favor-
ites, lesser—known ones from
his post—Television days, and
new ones from his recently-
released Drgamtime album like
”Penetration," ”The Blue
Robe," and ”There's A Reason."
His band, and of course Verlaine
himself, are a guitarist connois-
seur's delight,'and sure enough,
not a note was out of place all
night. ~ ‘
So what exactly was wrong?
Well, technically Verlaine and
crew can hardly be beat, but
they fail to generate much

excitement. Maybe cult heroes I’

are supposed to keep their per-
sonalities to themselves, but a
fl'ash~ of what's underneath
every once‘ in a while wouldn't
hurt. All we got was his.trade—
mark garbled lyrics and a man
who seemed tocenjoy what he
was doing, but didn't seem to
care about his audience. Not a
mortal sin, but maybe cult
heroes should be heard but not
seen.
