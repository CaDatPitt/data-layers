Efforts to unionize Pitt faculty
members will hit a peak today as
hearings begin downtown which
could ultimatelylead to the election
of one or more faculty collective
bargaining agents. *

Conducted by the Pennsylvania
Labor Relations Board [PLRB] at
the State Office Building in the
Golden Triangle, the hearings,
slated to last seven days, involve
Pitt’s administration and six faculty
rganizations bidding to represent

 various factions of the faculty.

At stake is the determination of an

' appropriate bargaining unit--a
group of workers with a community _

of interest who bind together for
purposes of collective bargaining.

Once _the composition of the
appropriate unit is determined by
the PLRD, the members of the unit
can vote for a collective bargaining

,x_i‘_agent to represent them.

The administration and the six
faculty.groups--the Pitt Profes-

sional Union (PPU), the American”

Association of University Profes-
sors (AAUP), the Pennsylvania
State Educational Association
(PSEA), the Pitt
Association (PLFA), the Faculty
Association for the School of
Medicine (FASM), and the Faculty

_ __'fl-,_l_\ssociation of the Graduate School

of Public Health (FAGSPH)--all
disagree on the appropriate com-
position of a collective bargaining
unit. ,

For example, the AAUP believes
all full-time faculty should be
considered one bargaining unit,
whereas the law faculty group says
it should be separated for various
reasons from liberal arts faculty.

Among the many other conflicts -
between the six groups is that’

while Pitt’s administration main-
tains all full-time faculty should be
included in the unit, the PPU

7.. argues that liberal arts faculty do
 not have a community of interest

with faculty in professional schools,
such as the School of Medicine.

Three faculty organizations are’

bidding to representthe general
Pitt faculty--AAUP, PPU, and
PSEA. The remaining three,
PLFA, FASM, and FAGSPH,all
professional school groups, entered
the unionization process attempt-
ing to be excluded from a large and
general faculty unit, where it is
feared their voices will not be
heard.

All parties will present arguments

_and witnesses to support their
«' ‘iv espective interpretations of the
7 rappropriate unit tb the Board's

Sidney Law-
of the

hearing examiner
rence. Upon receipt

evidence presented, he will make a
recommendation to the PLRB on
the‘ proper composition of a
bargaining‘

units-

 

Law Faculty»
— the FAGSPH followed

L3V.VTenC‘3-Ii, the Hen-on ',Avenue area behind

however, may conclude that there
should be more than one bargain-
ing unit--one for all full-time
faculty under the provost’s direc-
tion and one for medical school
faculty, for example.

In the event one or more of the
parties does not agree with the
examiner’s recommendation, an
appeal can be made directly to the
Labor Board. If the party disagrees

, with the Board’s ﬁnal decision on

technical grounds, the case could
wind up in court. 1 ‘

Most persons involved in the
unionization process predict the

‘hearings are likely to be long and

complicated, but some optimistic
estimates report an election for a’
collective bargaining agent by the
members of a unit to be designated
by the PLRB could take place as
early as April 1975.

The organizing of Pitt faculty for
collective ‘bargaining purposes
began in March 1973 when the PPU
began soliciting authorization cards
from Pitt‘ faculty members who
declared they were interested in
having a union represent them.
For various reasons, the AAUP, the
PLFA, the PSEA, the FASM, and
suit’ in
bidding for faculty support.

Under Pennsylvania Act 195, a
group of workers can petition for an
election once the ‘proposed group
has the support expressed by
“a11thorizati()n cards” for 30% of
that group. For example, if the law
school faculty decide they want to

'form a union, they must under

Pennsylvania law, have the author-
ized support of 30% of the entire
full-time law faculty. ’

The "hearing phase of the
unionization process was sparked

, in June by the PPU when, claiming
' 309; of a group’s

A support, it
petitioned the Labor Board for an
election of a bargaining agent
among the members of the group
they proposed. The PPU contend-
ed that at Pitt, an appropriate
collective bargaining unit should be

.pressed by William

comprised of all full-time faculty in
the provost’s area, ‘teaching fellows
and assistants, and librarians.

Immediately after the petitioning,
other faculty organizations, for
various reasons, ﬁled motions to
interveiie in the hearing and
election process.

Although the positions are tenta-
tive, and the Labor Board will make
the final decision, most of the
parties in the hearing process
maintain slightly different views as
to the propercomposition of an
appropriate bargaining unit.

Contrary to the PPU position, the

AAUP _and the administration
contend that the appropriate
bargaining unit should consist of all
full-time faculty.
‘~“We oppose fragmentation,”
explained Ray Richman, president
of the Pitt chapter of AAUP, which
has been for many years a
traditional faculty organization on
campus. “Why should_,a__~chart"er
member of the AAUP be forced to
drop out of the organization simply
because his school--the law school
for example--is not in the appro-
priateiunit? We have members all
through this university and they
should all be in the bargaining
unit." V

Richman_’s position is similar to
the administration's, aptly ex-
Hannon,
Director of Employee Relations."
“One university--one faculty,”
Hannon said ‘concisely, indicating
that the University should not be

C     Of Student Union Annex

BY KEN GORMLEY

Alleged misuse of the Student
Union Annex (old Bimbo's)-led to a
clash between Pitt and Oakland
Development Incorporated (ODI).
The building has become a
nighttime haven for trou-ble makers
according to ODI. "

Dan Stickler, chairman of the
two-block committee responsible
for. Bouquet Street Area and
Administrator at Presbyterian
Hospital, summarized the opinion
held by the rest of themembers of
his committee. “Old Bimbo’s just
isn’t being used for the purpose we
originally agreed upon, and we
c.-‘.n’t tolerate what goes on inside it
any longer.” I

Vice Chancellor for Studen

Affairs Alfred L. Moye disagreed.
-“From the standpoint of the
Student Affairs Office, it is being-
used as it -was intended,” said
Moye. “I don't understand why
there are objections to most of the
activities going on."

Committee member Bob Casciato.
responded that old Bimbo’s is

nothing more than a university

nightclub attracting neighborhood
hoodlums.

_“Since when are the parking lots
and walls of the building supposed

to be used as urinals?" Casciato

demanded. “Since when is the
front of the street supposed to be
used as a saloon? Community

really think they can help clean up
politics. It doesn’t seem as
helpless as it did four or five
months ago.”

The registration will take place in
the Student Union Art Gallery area
Tuesday from 10 am to 4 pm.
Anyone 18 years old or over,
residing in Allegheny county for 30
days prior to November 5 is eligible
and the event is open to the general
pubhc. _

“Our party has really cleaned
house,” Yauger said, “We got rid
of a lot of upper level corruption.
But I still think the Democrats will
out-register us.”

College Young Democrats Presi-
dent John Rohe agreed. “We

. usualiy out number the republicans

  

/I.

at Pitt betweeen 5 to 1 all the way
up to 9 to 1. But this really won’t
be any change. It almost always
turns out that way.”

Rohe said he didn’t see a large

‘ number of registration changes due

to recent political events. “If

see some of it, but whatusually

to see you walk down the/«street ‘

‘Moye recalled reports that the hall i"
had been used to house a dance for
Schenley High School Students--.
several weeks ago, “Ridiculous.” "
It was charged that the dance was 
publicized in the high school, and a 
large crowd appeared, resultingjn 
a public disturbance.

Moye said the reports hadbeen
greatly exaggerated.

“I think everyone should realize,“
that for some people everything we 
do is a public nuisance,” said
Moye. “For instance,‘ a few weeks
ago, I was called and told there was
a .rock concert going on in the,
Annex, attracting hordes of young’-
hoodlums. When I called up, I
found out there was one guitarist
playing in front of a mo\derate-sizedf
audience. This dance thing is just "

Lyel Wood, representing Alpha
Phi Alpha Fraternity, which spon-
sored the dance in question agreed"
the circumstances of the event. )

“To begin with, the only 
advertising done for the dance was 1
within the University, and this has ﬁ_
been confirmed by adminis/trators V‘
both at Pitt and Schenley High,” 

‘(Continued on 1’a_’(/ie 5)

Yauger and Rohe agreed there ‘,i
would be between 400 and 500,_,.f

registrants on Pitt campus this?‘
year. -“It mightnot seem like‘,-.
much,” Yauger said, “But last I

year we had less than .300." .
Citizen Information Center Direc-
tor Vic Papale, whose organization
is sponsoring the voter’s drive
‘along with the League of Women 
Voters, said registration would if
reach a median.  .
“It should be an ‘in between’ type .-

‘73, but it won’t be as high as ‘72,”
Papale said.

“Voter registration ﬁgures de-
pend on the kinds of races. They’ll
be higher in a presidential election
year than in a congressional 
election year. And they’ll be '
higher in a congressional .election
year than one where just local‘.
officials are running. This year is a ‘
congressional year so it won’t be ,
like last year when we only had’30O : 3 *
registrants and it won’t be like .‘72 _v 5'

its 1974/75 season with the exhibi-
tion, "Henry Koerner, Drawings in
Retrospect," from Saturday, Sep-

-‘tember 21 through October 13.

Koerner, whose provocative
paintings caused a sensation in the
art world in the late, 1940's and
early 1950's, is also one of the '
finest contemporary draughtsmen
in America. Consequently, the
Kingpitcher Gallery. decided to
emphasize his drawings in a retro-
spective which includes works dat-

ing back to 1945 when Koerner--
then with the army in Europe--
covered the Nurenberg War Trials
and pen and ink drawings done as
late as in Spring 1974 in Pitts-
burgh. .

The show also contains many of
the sketches made on the artist’s
annual travels to his native Austria.

Simultaneously with his drawings
exhibition at ‘Kingpitcher, the

Pennsylvania State’ University, 

New Kensington Campus, is fea-
turing a one-man show of Koer-
r:er's paintings. Another large
painting will be included in the

fragmented into many different
faculty bargaining units.

The PSEA, who in January
became the last organization to bid
for support among the general
faculty, claims there should be
three separate units--one for
faculty under the provost's direc-
tion, one for faculty in the health
professions and one for graduate
teaching assistants.

_Three other groups are attempt-
ing to become separate collective
bargaining agents in themselves.
The PLFA, which includes 100% of
the full-time law school faculty, ha§
separately petitioned the PLRB,
since the ﬁling of their motion last
summer, to become the collective
bargaining agent for law school
faculty. Richard Seeberger,
vice-chairman of the PLFA ex-
plained law schools have been
excluded from a large general unit"
in most unionization cases when
the law school faculty has asked to
be a separate unit.

In addition, the FASM, recently
organized in August, also seeks
exclusion from a general faculty
unit, such as the administration
advocates. According to Frances

_F‘{D1'€W, the group’s chairman, an
"overwhelming majority ofthe

medical school faculty have joined
the effort.

“Actually, we are joining in a
position allied with that of the PPU
and the PSEA--that the medical

school does not have a commonality
of interest with other faculty, and
should therefore be a separate unit
into itself.”

Finally, the Faculty Association of
the Graduate School of Public
Health formed two weeks ago and
quickly ﬁled a motion to intervene
in the hearings which begin today.

Strangely enough, there is no
unaminity among the faculty
groups as to the purpose of
creating a union. Essentially, the
PPU and the AAUP agree on two
factors.

“Certainly, the developments of
the past few months confirm our
feelings as to the need to
unionize," said Van Beck Hall,
former PPU president now on
sabbatical. “First, there is the big
problem of inflation. This is
especially. sticky when faculty
salaries are financed by the state,
as they are in this case. We have to
protect our interests as profess-
ionals economically."

AAUP president Richman added a
second fundamental reason. “We

must put an end to this problem of

tenure and security. In effect,
there is an abuse of power by the
administration here, real or illu-
sionary. The faculty simply believe
the administration's actions are
arbitary. There has to be some due
process and more faculty input into
this kind of decision making."
Although salaries in the law
school are not equal to those in

comparable law schools, Seeberger
did not find economics and tenure
control to be issues in the law
faculty's decision to petition the
Labor Board. ’

“We are accredited by the
American Bar Association," See-
berger explained. “And there are
many imposing restrictions. As a
law faculty, we’ have to protect
those restrictions and our interests.
If we end up in one overall unit, we
would certainly be swallowed up
and not recognized as we are to
some degree now.

“We as lawyers, have certain
obligations to the profession--like
maintaining high admissions stan-
dards--and we must take these
obligations seriously. So we must
protect our rights in these areas for
the good of the profession. If we
ever lost control, it would be very
damaging.”

Seeberger thought the mood of‘

the hearings would be like
something between a trial and an
investigation. Lawrence will

simply be collecting all the facts, he
said, to present them to the Labor
Board at the hearings conclusion.

But Hall, of the PPU, said “We_’ll
probably be cutting each others
throats down at the hearings and
then all through the election.

Yet, this year the conflicts have
multiplied, and the style and
function’ of the committee has
changed. In fact the committee’s
recommendations indiciate that SG
could function more effectively
without the services of the Alloca-
tions Committee. ,

As the representative body of
undergraduates, SG must remain
an organization dedicated in prin-
ciple at least, to serving the needs
of Pitt students. Student Govern-
ment representatives are charged
with the responsibility of present-
ing the student viewpoint on cam-
pus issues to the‘t faculty and
administration. ‘

It is essential, then, that our
‘representatives be aware of stu-
dent opinion and be able to
mobilize that opinion when neces-
sary. ,

The existence of student organi-
zations, which also work for the
common good of students, solves
the potential problems of a repre-
sentative governmentj—the inabi-
lity to identify student problems
and also the inability to resolve the ’
problems once they are indentiﬁed.

A classic example occurred last’
winter, when the University ad-
ministration attempted to impose a
$.25 time schedule fee on students.
Objecting to the proposal, the SGB
asked for and received the support
of many student organizations re-
cognized and funded by SG. g

SG President Mike Furick re-
requested organizations to write to
various University officials and ex-
press their dissatisfaction with the

Many students mistakenly as- I confl-Omatiom ‘
sume the $12 activities fee attached
to their tuition invoice paysttheir
entrance to varsity football and
basketball games.

The fee, however, is paid directly
to Student Government (SG),pand
the revenue earned from the fee
usually amounts tonearly $300,000
per year. These monies are used to
defray the operating expenses of
Student Government, which in-
clude the funding of more than 100
student organizations recognized
as such by SG and housed in the
Student Union. ,

Though the Student Government
Board [SGB], comprised of seven
representatives elected directly by
undergraduates, makes the final
decisions on all funding matters, it
is the responsibility of the eight
members of the Student Govern-
ment Allocations Committee to
collect the funding requests of the
many organizations, research the
validity of those requests, conduct
interviews with the organizations’
representatives, and make funding
recommendations to the SGB.

The committee's actions are a-
mong the most controversial in
Student Government. This is
undoubtedly due to the nature of
the committee. The eight members

members. It ceased publication last year due to disagreements
between Student Government and the UAR staff over the
publications’s format. _

‘These disagreements centered around the inadequate methods used
in the evaluations.‘ , '

In the past the decision to allow evaluation of a course was left to the
discretion of the faculty member. teaching the class. Many faculty
ji refused to allow evaluation of their classes with the result being that
few course evaluations actually appeared, in the publication to
,. jsuliicicritly assist students in course selection.

I Once the courses were evaluated, though, a faculty member again
could determine if the results were to be published. This made it
 possible for a teacher receiving a poor evaluation to prevent those
 results from seeing the light of day. S A
i ' Additionally, a decile system developed by the Center for the
,;Improvement _of Teaching was the statistical method used in the
‘H evaluation. Many students and faculty found this system confusing.

, The allocations Committee char-
acterized by its arbitrary decisions

has been responsible for nurturing

a relationship = between SG and ‘
organizations which is more com-
bative in nature. I

This is expecially evident in the a
allocations recommendations for ' "
three student organizations, the
Black Action Society, the Pitt
Young Socialist Alliance, the Pitt
News, and another committee of
Student Government, the Home-
coming Committee. »

The pettiness of the eight mem-
bers of the Allocations Committee
inhibits and eliminates any possibi-
lity,of developing the‘ naturally
cooperative relationship which
should exist.

Student Government‘ and student
groups should be willing ,to com-
municate with each other through-

problems and work together in 7>i""—“"
bringing those concerns to the
attention of the campus commun-
ity, and untimately resolving them
with the support and assistance of
the faculty and administration.

But, instead, the government
considers itself the master of

‘T student organizations. The Alloca-
tions Committee, obnoxious and
intolerant seeks not only to rule bUIC\‘<s..-745'
also to redicule. And this indicates
unequivocally the committee mem-
ber's failure to recognize their role
and that of SG as a representative
body. v

Private Funds Sought in
Hill District Renovation

(Continued from Page 1')

The existence of worked-out
mines under Herron Avenue pre-
sents the problem of mine subsi-
dence, which eliminates any possi-
bility of government funding. The
Urban Redevelopment Authority of
Pittsburgh commissioned the En-
gineering Firm of General Analy-
tics, Inc., of Monroeville, to study
the problem. '

The firm’s report estimated the
cost of stabilizing the land to
prevent subsidence at $160,000 per
acre. Anderson said the firm
recommended the area be devel-
oped for commercial, recreational,
and residential use. I

Realizing that federal funds will
not be forthcoming, Anderson is
relying on private ﬁnancing. In his
presentation of the proposal, sche-
duled tentatively for the 27th of this
month, Anderson hopes to suf-
ficientlyinterest several New York
ﬁrms to elicit a definite commit-
ment for financing. Beside the
possibility of Kidder Peabody

funding Anderson has already re-

quested aide from other sources.

“I submitted a grant application
to The Buhl Foundation to com-
plete market analysis and to make a
‘formal presentation of the conclus-
ions,” Anderson explained. “The
total budget I submitted was
$11,020, but I hope to eliminate two
staff positions, which would drop
$4,000 from the total.”

Eric Holmes, of the Pittsburgh

Department of City Planning, said, ”

“If he [Anderson] can demonstrate
financial backing, he would be
given land, as would anyone,
provided he can show us that his
resources are sufficient for the
project.”

Holmes stressed the difficulty of
obtaining such ﬁnancial backing
and noted that “Chatham Center,
the Civic Arena, and. Washington
Plaza are the only real examples of
someone’ doing something along
the scale that Mr. Anderson’s
planning.” -

come down because their own
schools don’t provide them with
anything to do. We have no control
over the people who gather

Wood admitted that the situation
on the streets of Oakland at night is
bad, but could see no reason for
trying to pin the blame on the SU
Annex. He also added that old
Bi'mbo’s is used for a variety of
other constructive purposes, such
as a practice room for choral

and private fund-raising fraternity

Wood said something must

indeed be done to alleviate the

worsening situation in Oakland but
the solution was not to. close old
Bimbo’s, which would add more
college students to the ranks of
aimless weekend streetwalkers,
but to find something to do for
those in the area who already fit
into that category.

City Councilman’ Bill Coyne, an
ODI member expressed similar
views. “I really don’t think it’s our
concern to consider ‘what goes on
inside the building,” Coyne said.
“With a little more policing outside
andin Oakland in general, I think
we can solve the problems.”

BY LYNN SCHEIDHAUER
. Iwatched as Susanne Smith, a

‘ Pitt graduate student, sandpapered
my skin, applied electrode contact

jelly and attached the electrodes
over my legs, between both collar
bones and ‘shoulder blades, and
over my heart.

I was preparing to experience
what hundreds of cardiac patients
have felt at the Human Energy
Laboratory in Trees Hall. Many of

' these people have dragged them-

selves into the Lab only to walk out
with a new outlook on life.

The Human Energy Lab, founded
in 1965, is a program which tests

I ’ human responses to exercise.

“We have the first method in the
country and, as far as we know, in

‘ the world to scientiﬁcally control

exercise dosage,” said Dr. Bruce
Noble. director of the Lab.

The testing room held a stationary
bicycle and a treadmill. In the
middle of these stood an electro-
cardiograph to record heart beats.

After being hooked up with-

electrodes, the lab’s teaching
fellow, Wesley Sime, instructed me
to step up onto the treadmill and
‘attach to my waist a belt suspended
from the ceiling. The belt was in
case I should fall.

Sime then attached the arm band
cuff and stethoscope to measure
and hear my blood pressure-

First was the warm-up where I

walked two miles an hour for about

two minutes.

During the test, Sime checked my
blood pressure and“ heart rate.

Tests such as this one are given to
cardiac patients before prescribing
individual exercises to stimulate
the cardiovascular system.

“We have found in our patients
an improvement of their cardiovas-
cular function as a result of
exercise,” said Noble. “There is no
evidence _as yet that exercise has
improved the condition of the heart
disease in the first place. But most
people find they can work at higher
work loads.” -

Referred to the Lab by their family

physicians, cardiac patients are

then given a physical by one of the
Lab’s two cardiologists, Dr. Law-
rence Adler and Dr. Frank Griff.
Because of certain variances in the
‘cardiogram, some people are not
accepted by the Lab.

“There are two factors we look at
to determine whether or not to
accept the patient,” said Noble.
“One is’ what level of exercise the
individual can tolerate-and still be
safe. And the other is what exercise
-provides a stimulus to the
cardiovascular system. '
“We have evidence that a person
has to exercise at about 60% _of
their maximum heart rate in order
to attain beneﬁts to the cardiovas-
cular svstem. _
‘rue “predetermined level” is
until the patients work 85% of their

Your Life

maximum heart rate.

During the test, if the patient’s
cardiogram shows no abnormali-
ties, they continue to this point. If,
however, patients show signs of
abnormality the doctors stop the
exercise.

“In this way, we know how high
we can exercise the patients
without endangering them,” said
Noble. “We then prescribe exerci-
ses that will work them just up to
this critical point.”

The Lab has three different
locations--the Golden Triangle
YMCA, the Oakland YIKC, and
Beulah Church in Churchill.

Cardiac patients go to these sites
on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday from 5 to 6 pm. There,
under supervision of exercise
physiologists, nurses and tech-
nicians, ‘the patients go through
their individually prescribed exer-
cises, mainly runningand walking.

\ -
“Three days a week is the
minimum time that you need to
provide help,” said Noble. “You
would improve more if you exercise
ﬁve days a week; but since most of
our patients are businessmen, ﬁve
days a week is not practical.”

.

I’ Pitt’s Human Energy] Resource Lab uses exercises to test human I
reactions to stress, and save lives.

Right now there are about 60
heart patients from ages 25 to 65
working in the program. About 200
more have been tested since the
program began.

“Our ultimate objective,” Noble

‘said, ‘ ‘is to return man to work. We

have had -people who have been
able to return to work as a result of
exercise.”

Off—Broodwoy Comes to. Chofhom

BY TOBI ROSEN
Preconceptions, more often than
not, prove to be correct. Therefore,
it was much to my delight when
Dear Nobody, which recently
played at Chatham College upset
all my notions regarding a
“one-woman” play. _ g
I deemed it inevitable that this
“play” would transform itself into
an over-elaborated lecture. Such is
usually the case, for the viewpoint
of a one-person play remains static.
Also, the physical theatrical
setting resembles a lecture hall,
with one individual on stage while
the rest listen attentively.

Films in Review

And yet the success story of Dear
Nobody is really quite twofold. The
playwrights, Jane Marla Robbins
and Terry Balanger, stumbled onto
an unpolished literary gem: Fanny
Burney’s letters. More importantly
were her journals which she .
addressed as “Nobody.” With
seemingly great ease, Robbins and

Old Trash   Replaces New I

BY M. C. PILECKI

These are the times that tr

movie persons’ souls. -
With the quality of the new ﬂicks
such that they open right in the
drive-in circuit [the cemetary for
the real lasers], and the good stuff

_ not yet coming to Pittsburgh, the

big box office numbers of the past
are being recycled.

One of the more notable re-
releases is «the rather unlikely
double bill of Butch Cassidy and

, the Sundance Kid with The

Poseidon Adventure. The latter,
more recent release is destined for
TV this year (whoopee), while the
former is still going great guns in
the revival houses.

There’s a reason for that of
course. Quite simple, Butch
Cassidy is by far the better m'ovie.
And in one humble opinion, it’s far
superior to its highly lauded
successor, The Sting. The 1973
Academy Award movie of the year
did have the two biggest esta-
blished box office stars, excellent
music and a fascinatingplot, ie,
everything going for it and no
reason to fail.

The 1969 western was a shaky
enterprise from the start, with only
one top draw star to give the
producer some breathing room.-

Director George Roy Hill had to.
V shoot one sequence in monotone‘

stills only, as he was using the set
of a much bigger budgeted [and
considered safer gamble] flick [the
subsequent bomb Hello Dolly].
Nobody expected the cultist reac-
tion that Butch Cassidy generated
and, in fact, still does.

The reason for its success is the
reason why The Sting doesn’t
measure up to it: the almost
perfect interaction between the two
central characters. Rarely‘has any
movie achieved such perfect
chemistry between two actors,
especially when one is the great
ham that Paul Newman is. The
Sting had to content itself with a
focus on Robert Redford with only
an occasional glimpse of the older
star, and only twice was there even
a hint of the old chemical reaction.

Butch Cassidy of course doesn't

 

have. theivplot: twists as does its

sequel: the ending is obvious from
the start. And behind the sparkling
dialogue, Butch Cassidy had -a
deeper, more foreboding air about
it of two tragic heroes. It was not
the “old-time entertainment” of
The Sting. And the music is not as
stylish. Burt Bacharach was not
(and is not) the accomplished
movie musician that Marvin
Hamlisch is. Still, director Hill
made ‘-‘Raindrops Keep Fallin”
much more memorable in its one
brief scene than he did by using
ragtime as mere backdrops for
scenes of Redford running around a
set. The Sting had to succeed
because it had every big name in
the biz working on it. And those
names became big because of
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid.

But-you might want to pass up the
second half of the bill, the

the male roles, especially that of
King George, her female charac-
ters added vibrant excitement to
the stage. Excellent mannerisms
and gestures helped to create that
spark of realism. Not since Charles
Grodin’s remarkable execution of
Lenny have I been so taken by a
solo performance.

Robbins’ arduous task of main- A

taining audience attention for
approximately two hours was made
easier due to the solid material she
co-authored. The play concen-

,trated on the important years of

Burney’s life--from her 15th
birthday until the happy content-
ment of middle age. During that
time span, she published Evelina
which acted as a stepping stone to
her success. From that point on,
she. hob-nobbed with the cream of
London’s literary society--the likes
of Richard Sheridan and Dr.
Samuel Johnson.

Other notable incidents were her
service at the court of King George
III and courtship with a French
general whom she eventually
married. But one of the most
insightful tales centered around
her father, musicologist Charles
Burney. Their perennial verbal
battles revealed themselves
through the prism of her engaging
personality.

Robbins captured complete eye
focus as a minimum of props and
handsome costumes unobtrusively
served their purpose. It is
interesting to note that costume
designer,‘ Patricias Zipprodt, has
enjoyed much notoriety with
costuming for Pippin, The Grad-
uate, and Fiddler on’ the Roof
among others.

“Butch Cassidy" Tops Releases

last ‘two decades are. I Anthony
Burgess originally wrote a book by
the same name in which he created
what had to be the lowest character
on earth: he raped, maimed, killed
even the cliche cute harmless
puppy without A a twinge of
conscience.

And the violence he’ wreaked on
the world was matched by what he
did to the language. _ He was
uncultured and uncouth, without a
saving grace in the world, unless
you can count that he accorded
some respect to composer Bee-
thoven and his music. Anyway,
Burgess,created this lowest scum
of the earth type to show that even
he had basic human rights, and no
one has the right to interfere with

College football would be much
more interesting if‘ the faculty
played instead of the students, and
even more interesting if the
trustees played. There would be a
great increase in broken arms, legs
and necks, and simultaneously an
appreciable diminution in the loss
to humanity. '

his free will. .

Well, when Stanley Kubrick (he of
the great snowjob of 2001: A Space
Odyssey) got hold of it, he made
the main character Alex a new sort
of dashing Errol Flynn type hero,
who sings cutely while beating ‘a
man senseless. Alex was a
sympathetic hero now, not some-
one to be despised from the start
but someone to be applauded and
emulated (a gruesome pheno-
menon that happened widely in

England and in many parts of the

US).

In other words, Kubrick blew it.
He missed the whole point of
Burgess’ character and instead
used the screen as a forum to show
off his now famous’ gimmickry and
to glorify violence in its crudest
form. The idea of human rights,
even for the worst of humanity, was
lost completely‘ in the 1972 movie
and, turning "around the original
idea completely, was made into a
might-makes-right. idea [whoever
has the most might at the moment],
exactly the opposite of what
Burgess’ book was talking about.
You blew it, Stanley.

There’s some more recent mater-
ial around, too, like the double bill
of Cinderella Liberty and Paper
Chase. The former is. an uneven
flick wavering between sticky
schmaltz and heavy “adult” stuff.

Yellow Jacket ballcarrier in Saturday’s 27-17 Pitt victory.

Back On

llllllllllllllllllllIllllllllllllllllllllllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE

Atlanta, GA. After a disasterous pre-season camp and an
unimpressive first game victory, the Pitt Panthers are right on ,
schedule, according to head coach Johnny Majors. And if that sounds
paradoxical--it is. «

Saturday’s win over Georgia Tech answered a lot of questions and
undoubtedly shut the mouths of Pitt’s most ardent cynics. With Navy’s‘
upset _of Penn State, the Panthers are now Number One in the East and
that fact combined with two games of experience makes Pitt a 100%
better team. , _

“Going into the F lordia State game we were not that enthusiastic,”

' Majors has stated several times. ,_“In a way it’s a blessing in disguise

we barely came away a winner. It was good because we didn’t bring
back a feeling of false security.” « -

Going into the Georgia Tech encounterjthe Panthers knew they had
their work cut out for them. All week prior to.the game, practice
sessions were wildly enthusiastic; the enthusiasm that was a standard
of last year's Fiesta Bowl ‘squad. It wasn’t until last Wednesday that
Majors felt satisfied with the progress in the daily workouts.

“Last Tuesday’s practice was horrendous,” Majors said, “but on

Wednesday we hit like we’ve never hit before. I saw the ‘enthusiasm
and spirit that had been lacking.” — .
P The win over Tech was thorough and complete in every aspect of the
game, and it is that result which gives Majors his new attitude. I
Spreads called for Pitt by no more than a touchdown, if that, but it was
more of a tossup. , -

Mike Carey, the center and one of but a few veterans of the offensive '
line, called the Tech contest “one of the most scary” games he’s ever
played. v ‘

‘‘It’wasn’t that we were scared of them,” Carey said in the locker
room after the game. “But Tech is"the type of team that can do
anything, anytime. I really didn’t know what to expect.”

Majors’ pleasures with his offense came from the pair ‘of sustained
drives they put together. Both of Pitt’s last two touchdowns came in
the final quarter, but the drive in the closing minutes of the third was
the first for what still .has to be called a “somewhat
inexperienced” offensive front. ~ I '

There is no doubt that the ﬁnal touchdown drive iced the game away.
After Pepper Rodger’s decision to kick a ﬁeld goal with fourth and four
0V€I‘ nine minutes left to play, the Pitt offense ate the
clock, yardage and put the points on the board to keep Tech out of
reach.

The defense, led by Gary Burléy, Don Parrish, Arnie Weatherinton,
Glenn Hodge (and the list can go on and on),\picked Rodgers wishbone‘
clean, snapped it and got their wish. Both FSU and Tech’s offenses
showed signs of breakdown due to weariness in the fourth quarter.

The Panther defense just doesn’t stop their opponents, they brutally

. manhandle them.

According to Majors’ timetable, Pitt desperately need to be 2-0 going
into the Southern can game. And what he didn’t see against FSU, well

a it was there and then some against Tech. I V
“I was worried about conditioning,” Majors said, “and if we hadn't
been a fourth quarter team we would have lost.” '

“We’re a young team that still hasn’t learned to win , YET” Majors
said, echoing a favorite proverbial phrase. “That’s a big
factor--sometimes people expect I things from us that we just aren’t
capable of doing.” \ I

The feeling of securityhas settled on the Panthers and it’s not false.

But it will never be unrealistically intoxicating. Note-gwith John_nyl_d;

ATLANTA——It seems the Pitt
offense is a little ahead of schedule
after the Panthers‘ impressive win

to the start of the season, Johnny
Majors was concerned his offensive

counting on his veteran defense to

“West Chester Rolls

Booters

By JOHN C. BLACKBURN 

The weather for the soccer
game Saturday wu cold. damp
and generally miserable. but for
the whopping crowd of 29 jam-
ming Pitt Stadium. it turned out to
be the high point of the day.

“We failed to swing the ball
early in the/game,” said Pitt
coach Leo Bemis. “Maybe .we
didn’t think we could find the gaps
and make the "cuts because the
field was so wet. But we just kept
going straight ahead, they took a
three-goal lead, and they were
strong enough to hold it.”

The strong West Chester State
team didn’t merely hold its lead.
it increased it to a final 7-1. Pitt
averted a shutout when right wing
Billy Rex rolled one past reserve
goaler Kevin Segar with just 15
seconds left.

“West Chester’ did _ almost ev-
erything better than we did to-
day."_ Bemis said. “When we
scrimmage this week. we're go-
ing to use some new people and
see if we can't get together.“

Well, it appears the'offense has
fianlly caught up and a full week
ahead of schedule. It was the Pitt
offensive machine, led by All-
American Tony Dorsett, that hand-
ed the Ramblin’ Wreck its second
loss in three games and raised the
Panther’s records to 2-0, with a
27-17 victory. \

"I've never been happier to win a
football game," said Majors fol-
lowing the game. “One of the big
factors that made me happy was
the way the offense moved the ball
when it had to."

The offense was able to move the
ball_ primarily through the running
of Dorsett who gained a total 02168
yards on 29 carries while scoring
two big touchdowns. Dorsett
battled his way through the Tech
defense leaving his opponents
‘sprawling on the turf as he closed
A on the Pitt career rushing mark.

He needs just 23 yards to tie the

career total of Marshall Goldberg

who compiled 1,957 yards in his

three years of play from 1936 to

1938.
Pitt’s defense also held up well

Pitt was not the least bit to-
gether against West Chester, and
the frustration showed: left wing
John Moraham, simmering
throughout the first half, was is-
sued an official warning. shortly
before its close. “The ball was
five or six yards away, and Mora-
han just reached out and kicked a
West Chester player’s heel,” said
official Al Crompton, who gave
the warning.

Middle fullback Jerry Luxbach-
er was ejected for a similar vio-
lation late . in the game. “He
(Crompton) didn’t, give me any
warning." said the brother of
Bemis’ assistant Joe Luxbacher.

“He called me for playing the,

man. insteadof the ball."

West Chester. has a reputation
for playing rough soccer. but
coach Mel Lorback saw Satur-
day’s ‘game differently: “I

thought most of the bad contact‘

out there was on Pitt's part. We're
very strict aboutillegal rough-
ness—if one of our guys gives an
illegal hit. his ass is out of the
ball game.“ '

“Therejwas a lot of shit going

on out there in the first half, but ,

the officials got it under control
pretty quickly,” said Lorback, a
small, wiry man who spares few
four-letter words. He is a perfec-
tionist who believes in screaming
at his players’ mistakes, even
when he’s leading 5-0 or 6-0. ‘

Also. he recognizes that all the
trapping. heading andgkicking
skills don’t mean anything if you
don‘t get to the ball and use them.‘
and West Chester was beating
Pitt to the ball throughout the
game. ‘

"We don’t give any scholar-
ships."~Lorback said.‘ “so we
don't get the real good kids. But

, they're all very willing. so we try
to compensate by developing co-
hesiveness.  — if ' ’

The Panthers weren’t slowed by

the quick reprisal of the Yellow-

drive near the end of the first
quarter which they climaxed in the
opening minute of the second
period with another touchdown.
Dorsett got his second TD of the
season when he electrified the

was 20- 14.

-The Panthers weren’t assured of a
win however, as Georgia Tech
continued to push the ball into Pitt

Sims and Moriarty. But the Pitt
defense rose to the task and held

with another touchdown in the final
minutes of the game. Pitt drove ()7
yards in just nine plays for the
score with senior Bruce Murphy
taking a pass just inside the
endzone for the score. Murphy
made a great grab in a crowd of
Tech players exhibiting the out-
standing form which has charac-
terized his play throughout the
opening two games. His touch-
down was all the Panthers needed
to insure the victory as a late Tech
drive fell far short.

The real test of the Panthers
ability will come this Saturday
when the USC Trojans come to Pitt

Stadium for the home opener. USC ’

was embarassed in its opening
game against Arkansas, 22-7, and
had this week off giving them
plenty of time to prepare for Pitt.
But, with Pitt’s defense playing
outstanding football, and the of-
fense improving weekly, Pitt fans
will be treated to probably the most
exciting game in the ‘past few

DENVER AP — Pittsburgh quar-
terback Joe Gilliam engineered
three second-half scoring drives
Sunday to rally the Stellers to a
.35-35 tie with the Denver Broncos
that could not be resolved in a
15-minute sudden—death overtime
period. ’

li was the first regular season
game in National Football League

history to require an extra session.
The new suddeii-death rule was
established for the 1974 campaign.

Both teams had chances of win-

ning field goal attempts late in
the game. As‘ time expired in the
fourth quarter, Pittsburgh's Roy
Gerela tried a 25—yarder, but it was
blocked by Barney Chavous and
Bill Tliompsoii.

Steelers, Denver Tie In Overtime,

Midway through the overtime,
after John Rowser had intercepted
and returned the ball to near
midfield and the Pittsburgh de-
fense held Denver for eight plays,
Jim Turner tried a 41 yard field
goal, but it was wide.

Denver's passing game was ef-
lective in the first quarter as- the
Broncos moved out to a 21-7 lead.

to 21-14 at the half.

The Steelers then turned a pair of
interceptions into- scores in the
