Tuberculin Tests Mark
First Step In War

Against Social Menace
By HOWARD LANDY

The campus campaign for tu— !
berculosis tests, beginning to-
day, strikes at one of the most
important phases of student
health.

Of 38,000 college students
tested for tuberculosis in 1932-34,
31 per cent were found to be in-
fected. Many of them had no
symptoms of the disease and were
living normal, active lives. But
all of them face the danger of
long, weakening, perhaps fatal
illness. This is how tuberculosis
works.

Once the bacteria are inside the
body, their activity is slow, pro-
gressively weakening the body
more and more until it is almost
incurably weakened. It has been
found that girls, because of their
rapid growth during adolescence,
are more susceptible than boys.
Industrial workers, because of im-
proper living conditions, com-
prise the majority of all cases.
The mortality rate among Ne-
groes is two to three times high-
er than among whites.

Third Of Fates

All in all, tuberculosis next to
syphillis and war, is the greatest
destroyer of human life.

Like these two, tuberculosis
can best be checked by treatment
in the early stages. And the
great decline in the incidence of
tuberculosis during the last thirty
years has shown us just what
must be done if tuberculosis is to
be eradicated entirely.

Undoubtedly, the rise of living
standards in the United States
and the great increase in the
number of sanatoria account for
the decline in tuberculosis. Still
it is not quite correct to say that
the reason for its prevalence to-
day is entirely due to poor living
conditions and inadequate hospi-
tal facilities.

Speaker Honored
In Commons Hall
After Ceremony

Assailing current educational
trends toward a preponderance
of “vocational” subjects, Dr.
Gordon J. Laing, editor of the
University of Chicago Press,
speaking at the Scholars’ Day
assembly, Friday in Memorial
Hall, declared that a “broad, cul-
tural education” is necessary for
good citizenship.

Honorary fraternities tapped
approximately 300 s t u d e n t s
to membersrip, and ten special
awards were presented to out-
standing students at the assembly.

“This tremendous trend toward
the ‘practical’ subjects,” said Dr.
Laing, “is a most damaging thing
for our citizenship. The ‘cultural’
subjects which are being elimin-
ated are the very ones through
which students get the mental
training and discipline of mind
necessary for good citizenship.”

For the education of any man
who is going to have problems to
solve during his life, asserted Dr.
Laing, the prescribed courses
should be made up of studies
which give a training of “severe”
mental discipline.

“But why all this criticism?”
asked Dr. Laing, “Isn’t this a
wonderful era, shouldn’t the edu-
cation which produced it be given
some credit? The advances, the
progress that we have made is all
along one line——the material one.

Tuberculosis scourge of young America killed 75,000 peo-
It is felt that this tuberculin skin
analysis test, which gives a deﬁnite negative or positive tuber-
culosis baccili reaction, is particularly invaluable for college
Gstudents since the disease is most

prone to attack people of college
age.

The tuberlin tests at the student
health services will be administer-
ed to the men by Dr. H. C. Carl-
son, director of the men’s student
health service, and Dr. Paul Zeh-
fuss, assistant to Dr. Carlson.

Dr. Auleene M. Jamison, direc-
tor of the ‘"omen’s health service,
will handle women's tests. Men’s
tests will be taken at Falk Clinic;
those for the women will be taken
at the women's student health
service in the Cathedral.

Tests will be given only on
Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednes-
days. _

NOT FOR FACULTY

These tests mark the second
health campaign of the year, con-
ducted jointly by the student
health services and The ,Pitt
News. Last fall, the anti—syphilis
Wassermann tests were taken by
approximately 2,000 students and
faculty members.

The tuberculin tests are not
being offered to faculty members.

In a pre-campaign survey, the
tuberculin test project has gained
wide approval. The Tuberculosis
League of Pittsburgh has offered
its full facilities in aiding the cam-
paign, and student leaders on
campus have pledged their sup-
port of the project.

NEWS STAFF TESTED

Approximately 100 members of
The Pitt News editorial and busi-
ness staffs will take the tests to-
day.

“This campaign is probably a
more important one than the Was-
sermann tests taken last fall, at
least to our student body,” said
Dr. Carlson. “The Wassermann
tests were more in the nature of
an educational campaign than an
actual health campaign.

“The tuberculin tests, on the
contrary, will certainly show
many positives -—-cases which

must be investigated immediately

if the disease is to be halted.”
Student health offices will be

open from 9 -o’clock until 4:30

A Note To Plague

The ‘White Plague’

IN COLLEGES and universities the

country over, students have shown
an ever-growing interest, recently, in
the problem of personal and public
health. They have shown an increasing
spirit to cooperate in broad programs
designed to detect a.nd prevent diseases
and are rapidly on the way to an under-
standing of the old ideal the
necessity of sound physical health to
make living worth while.

Two of these broad programs in
which they are cooperating by taking
voluntary tests are the current cam-
paigns against syphilis and tubercu-
losis. Both of these diseases are sub-

tle in their workings, and both are dis-

eases which are particularly devastat-
ing to youth. Youth, it seems, is ready
to ﬁght these diseases when it is given
the opportunity _ '
The program of free_Tuberculin Anti-

Tuberculosis tests for students, which-.

begins this morning, marks the second
major student health campaign. Medi-
cal authorities believe it Will be even
more beneﬁcial to the student body than
the Wassermann test campaign against
syphilis which was carried on last se-
mester. *

According to the Tuberculosis
League, fully half a million persons are
today actively sick with the disease . . .
enough to populate a city the size of
Washington, Minneapolis, or New
Orleans. ‘

What makes‘ tuberculosis 21- really
dangerous enemy is that it strikes hard-
est at those in the prime of life. The
greatest number of its victims are in
the group aged from 15 to 45 years. A
large number of these people have the
disease for a long time before it is
detected.

The Tuberculin test is a relatively
simple process by which tubercle bacilli
in the body may be revealed. The stu-
dents who will take the test will sub-
ject themselves to no greater discom-
fort than the energy required to take
them to the health services.

If the doctors in the student health
services ﬁnd but one case of unsuspect-
ed tuberculosis in a. student, they will
consider their time and energy well
spent; they will have the opportunity to
save his career. If as many students
turn out for these tests as did those last
semester for the Wassermann tests, cer-

tainly more than one case of unsuspect- »

ed tuberculosis will be found.

One ﬁnal thought on the health cam-
paign which begins today is this: Aside
from the reasons for student coopera-
tion listed above, modern society dic-
tates that the individual can ﬁnd no
excuse in sickness for being unproduc'
tive. He must keep healthy along the
lines that medical knowledge pre-
scribes. There are no positions in this
work-a-day world for those physically
i1§a.pable.

The Tuberculin tests will help some
students ﬁnd their way to health.

Editor, The Pitt News:

The Commons Room is ours. It has been given
to the students of Pitt for their own pleasure. Its
high vaulted ceiling, its graceful arches, its cathe-
dral like but frigid, atmosphere, its peacefulness, all
were dedicated to us by the Chancellor.

But we could not appreciate its qualities so they
gave us music:-—-organ music that grew on us so
that we yearned to hear it. We grew to appreciate
the Commons Room with its dignity and its strength.
Now we hear that the heart of this room——the music
-—is to be stilled.

Are we going to lose our appreciation of this
room when we have just found it? Certain pro-
fessors who have the ﬁfth hours on Tuesdays and
Thursdays Wish to have the music stopped. Are
the students of their classes to be deprived of an
hour of ﬁne music? If these few professors must
have classes during the ﬁfth hour, why not move
their classes to one of the many rooms out of the
range of the music.

Are we asking too much to have our one hour of
music and relaxation continued? With the ap-
proaching weekly teas on Monday, the organ music
would also be appreciated. We appeal to the fac-
ulty and to the Chancellor not to take away what
you have just given us——the organ music.

the 1.200 and some odd pages of"
Anthony Adverse.

Critics seem to be of the opin-
ion that this book holds up quite
well, though they offer the same
criticism that was aapplied to its
longer predecessor——an artiﬁcial-
ity of style that detracts from the
general sincerity of Allen’s work.

‘IMPERIAL CITY’

Literary men still prefer Al-
len’s ﬁrst notable work, Israfel
(a biography of Edgar Allen Poe),
a book which had little popular
appeal-—quite understandable as
far as I am concerned.

Many have asked at the library
desk for Elmer Rice’s Imperial
City. Mrs. Downs, Librarian of
the Lending Department, has as-
sured me that this book and Ac-
tion at Aquila have been ordered,
and should be ready for circula-

_ ‘ tion in a week or so.

COMPANION PIECE

Imperial City is a widely read
and discussed novel of life in a
big city, New York City presum-
ably furnishing the background.
It has had a tremendous popular
appeal, but critics have lambasted
it unmercifully.

They claim that Rice, a play-
wright of great proﬁciency, is out
of his field, and that his writing
is artiﬁcial, superﬁcial, and insin-
cere. It must, -however," be inter-
esting reading. H. Footner’s New
York, City, of Cttiesshould be a
pleasing companion" piece to Im-
perial City, — for“ ,comparison's
‘sake, if for no other.’ '

In Spring A Football Player

Turns To Fundamentals

By

   

 mes
it

Leonard Levison

Close to the heart of every college coach is the desire to
take :1 boy who lms gained meager, if any at all, recognition in
a particular field of athletic endeavor, and to develop him mto

an outstanding varsit._v incumbent.

This axiom, being a general

rule that applies to the average coach, should by the law of

relative qualities apply with
more profound meaning to Dr.
Jock Sutherland, who is far and
above being regarded among the
median in his profession.
8 It '-‘l=

And so it is. Furthermore, spring
is the time of the year not only
when a football player’s fancy
turns towards thoughts of funda-
mentals, but also when any man’s
thoughts concern those things
within the approximate area of
his heart. Thus, by an obvious piece
of logic, it is only ﬁtting and pro-
per that Dr. Sutheralnd should
ﬁnd himself in that seasonal pe-
riod when he makes his annual
plea to the novice.

3 =i= 3?

In the lead story on other por-
tions of this page, the Pitt football
coach vents his feelings on the
matter as he asks for candidates
for his gridion squad. Further
public expression of this desire is
evidenced on any of the campus
bulletin boards where signs have
recently been placed, making the
same request.

2: =2: 

Real Invitation

We write in an attempt to per-
suade the doubter. But, the best
persuasion for those interested will
come after they go to Stadium
Gate 3 and get some practice re-
galia from equipment manager
Frank“ Scott. If you have any
“serious interest” in football and
some conﬁdence in your physical
attributes; these are the days to
get into thexeridiron swing of
things.

-99 0! $

Our recommendation for this
sort of experience is motivated
chieﬂy by one belief. It is plain-
ly and simply this-—-that by going
out and spending time on the
practice field and on the gridiron
squad, you come under one of the
finest inﬂuences that it is possible
to be guided by on this campus,
or on any other campus, for that
matter. That inﬂuence, and in-
spiration as it may be, is the one

exerted by Dr. Jock Sutherland,
who is considered just about one
of the best educational leaders in

this institution.
5“

«it .- 

The general run of football talk
in the past few years has indicat-
ed that Pitt’s head football man
is the best of his kind. This be-
lief is upheld by those who have
some authoritarian status in the
football ﬁeld and also by that great
army of Monday morning quarter-
back that ﬁlls the stadia each
week-end. There has been some
slight charge among the rabble
that the major portion of the good
doctor’s success is caused by the
fact that he has what may be
classified as the best raw mate-
rial. There is one twisted con-
ception in this reasoning. The
more accurate fact is that he de-
velops his squad into the best ma-
terial.

N 0 Politics:

Vvhen his candidates convene on
upper Trees ﬁeld this afternoon,
Dr. Sutherland will officially
start his worrying for the 1938
campaign, and by campaign we do
not refer to the gubernatorial
campaign of which certain politi-
cal writers seemto, have the im-
pression the good doctor would be
actively interested .in this fall.
May it be put in the-record that
Sutherland will be a great more
concerned. during the
months over’ theteams that Jim-
my Crowley, Wallace Wade, Harry
Stuhldreher, and Matty’ Bell,
among others, 1 will confront
him with than the particular
strategies of. Dave Lawrence, Dave
Stern, Johnny Lewis, et all, which
he will only observe from the
sidelines. '

=14 =I<

:1: vi: :2 '

When he looks today for a cou-
ple of tackles, a center, and a full-
back, the- good doctor. will not

realize more than ever that he will
havemore worries than one man

can handle. v . _‘-~

Pitt Swimming Team  

Just how good a competitive
athletic team, is a relative
matter. Just how good the Pitt
swimming team is is likewise a
relative matter. And from a
relative point of view, they are
the best. In the way of dual
matches no team had as much as
given them a
serious splash.

Saturday, they
rolled in with
the tide to
leave some of
the best teams
in the East in
the backwash
as they stroked
their way to a
overwhelmingly
decisive East-
ern Collegiate
C o nf e r ence
Championship.

Scoring 40 points to second
Rutgers’ 25, the Panthers’ easily
outdistanced the ﬁeld. Other point-
winners were Franklin and Mar-
shall with 24, Western Reserve
with 17, Lehigh with 4, NYU with
3, and both CCNY and Carnegie
Tech had 2.

As they have done in every
other meet of the Pitt year, Milton
Lederstein and Albert Beacon, two
very robust sophomores paced the
Panthers to victory.

Lederstein, a workhorse, was the
individual high point man of the
meet. He gained two ﬁrst places,
winning the 220-yard and 440-
yard free-styles, both by sub-
stantial margins. In the 440-yard,
he had his practice pacer, team-
mate Tommy Locke, beside him
all the way into the last lap as
Locke ﬁnished second.

Beacon, who seems to have def-
inite Olympic
p o s s ib ilities,
continued his
record breaking
style as he set
the only new
mark in the
slow Metropoli-
tan Club pool.

Beacon

Beacon’s 1 50-
yard backstroke
winning time

was 1:41.41, the
previous record
1:42. Alex Slo-
bodian ﬁnished second to give Pitt
another one-two.

Lederstein

.Wins Eastern Crown

 

Bill Brown, outdiving Rutgers’
Deith by only two points, annexed
the diving championship, adding
another ﬁrst for Pitt. Milt Leder-
stein and Walt Nowotny, swim-
ming very capable last legs, help-
ed the Pitt relay team to a ﬁrst
place in the 440-yard relay.

Frank Miller, F&M’s great
sprinter, was the other individual
star of the meet. He won "both
the sprints, the 50 and 100-yard
dashes. Jack Gorman of Western
Reserve captured the breaststroke,
dethroning defending champion
Timko of Rutgers. The 300—yard
medley relay was won by West-
ern Reserve team of Seid, Gorman,
and Otis.

Among the outstanding swim-
mers who appeared here for the
meet were Jack Gorman of West-
ern Reserve, the star backstroke-
er, Frank Miller, who is only a
sophomore at Franklin and Mar-
shall but who is nowiconsidered
one of the country’s best sprinters,
and Deith, the Rutgers’ diver, who
was only beaten out by the barest
margin.

As is usual in a collegiate meet,
there was some question as to who
won the 50-yard dash and. in what
order the others placed. The ﬁn-
ishing is so close that the judges
have a hard time.

Sutherland Asks For Gri
Candidates

Short Sessions
Will Feature

Fundamentals

By BILL MAZEFSKY

Defense of the national grid-
iron chainpionship begins this
afternoon at Trees practice
ﬁeld. Dr. John B. Sutherland
will run all candidates through
the ﬁrst session of the abbrevi-
ated spring training period at
this time. About twentyeight
days of practice. have been de-
creed for the gridders. When
this is completed, football train-
ing will end until “September
10, when the squad comes back
to start the similarly shortened
fall session.

VETERANS RETURN

Coach Jock Sutherland is anxi-
ous to have all those “seriously in-
terested in football” report to the
Stadium and crawl into mole-
skins. “Anyone that can run a
little, who isn’t spoiled, and can
take a few bumps without winc-
ing has a good chance to make the
squad,” observed the Pitt mentor.

New talent usually blooms out
during the Spring practice ses-
sions. The entire time is devoted
to fundamentals. With no pub-
lic game Saturday to haunt the
coaches they can concentrate on
the basic framework of a cham-
pionship squad—a thorough work-
able knowledge of fundamentals.

graduation has left a few big holes
in‘ theline-up. ‘Sutherland must
find a fullback and center and

iors. and:leave the fullback bur-
d';n_ ito inexperienced Bill Farkus

HeinieAAdams' and Don Hens-
ley, who ‘handled "the snapper- ’

backposition, leave that position
to Bob Dannies and Dick Fuller-
ton. All-American’ Tony Matisi,
George Delich, and Ted Schmidt
are some six hundred odd pounds
of very good graduating tackle.
Returning ' veterans include Elmer
Merkovsky, vBen Asavitch, ‘Bud
Hafer, and Carmen Etzi. ’
FROSH STAR

Frank Souchak and Johnny
Micheloson also leave for greener
ﬁelds but their departure will not
be so keenly felt. cSouchak’s end
position will be handled by Bill
Daddio, .Fabian Hoffman, "Paul
“Bomber” "Shaw" and Johnny
Dickinson. Johnny Chickerneo
and Ben Kish will run in to ﬁll
Johnny Micheloson’s quarterback
position.

Dante Dalle Tezze is the only
dent made by graduation in the
array of guards. Al Lezouski,
Steve Petro, Walter Roskowski,
and Harold Klein will be back to

chop down enemy tacklers. The
halfback situation looks very
rosy. ‘
GRADS TO COACH ,
Marshall “Biggie? Goldberg,‘

who made practically ‘every All-
American team that saw print,
will be back to churn the stadi-
um turf. “Biggie,” Harold “Cur—
ly” Stebbins, and “Dandy Dick”
Cassiano will give the .1938 Panth-
er team a trio that someone ought
to dud “The Touchdown Triplets.”
Larry Peace and Emil Naric will
be back to do some ball-toting
from the halfback slot. Ernie
Bonelli, up from the freshman
team, has the tmaking’ of a triple
threat man. Ernie can run, pass,
and kick.

The rest of the freshman squad
is of unknown quality. Whether
or not some of them will step up
to ﬁll a varsity squad is problem-
atic. The answer to the problem
may lie in the current spring prac-
tice sessions.

TRYOUTS URGED

Though graduated from a play-
ing roll, Johnnny Micheloson and

Don Hensley will’ be back as
coaches. Johnny will replace
Charley Bowser as backﬁeld

coach. Bowser and Daugherty
will help out during spring prac-
tice and then step down from
their positions to devote all of their
time to their respective business
careers. Sutherland has not yet
selected a chief assistant to re-
place Bowser.

Hensley will take over Dr.
Ralph Daugherty’s job of coach-
ing the centers. Dr. Daugherty
has a growing medical practice
which demands all his time.

The coaching staff now includes
Head Coach, Dr. Jock Sutherland;
End Coach, Eddie Schultz; Guard
Coach, Mike Milligan; Tackle
Coach, Alex Fox; Center Coach,
Don Hensley; Halfback Coach,
Mike Nicksick; Backﬁeld Coach,
Johnny Micheloson.

FUTILE GESTURE

Winning the game was a futile
gesture for Pitt as Duquesne earl-
ier defeated Western Reserve in
the ﬁnal minutes of an exciting
game to clinch the western dvisi-
sion race. Their win gave them

 twenty points, one more than the .

Panthers can possibly get even if
they win their remaining games.

FOUL POINT

Tech was awarded a goal on a
technicality in a wild period while
Pitt had ﬁve men on the ice. Con-
ick was accused by the referee of
throwing his stick in front of the
puck after Culver had shot. There
is a ‘hockey ruling that prohibits
throwing of the stick at a shot
puck if there is only one man be-
tween the goalie and attacker

The second period was compara-
tively tame as Tech made several
attempts to score. At one time
Culver and Schiwalske of the Tar-
tans teamed up with a double pass
to elude Pitt’s defense, but Ellis
stopped Culver’s shot.

Highlighting the evening was
the Pitt band. Led by Co-ed Cap-
tain Mary Vfhitney, the band went
through its intricate maneuvers on
skates to much approval.

Addresses

Scholars’ Assembly

Students, Present

Special Awards

(Continued from Page One)

As far as culture is concerned, this
is a creaking age.”

Subjects which are generally
considered “cultural” are practic-
al in the highest sense of the
word, claimed the speaker. The
training in thought which these
subjects afford, he said, consti-
tute a basic element of good citi-
zenship.

INTENSE SPECIALIZATION

“If a student hasn’t received a
sound general education in high
school and the ﬁrst two years of
college, the chances are that he’ll
never get it. The specialization
in the last two years of college
and in graduate work is too in-
tense,” commented Dr. Laing.

As a result of too much special-
ization, many of the men teaching
in colleges today are ineffective
teachers because “they know
their own ﬁelds, but nothing else,”
he continued. -

“A successful teacher must have
two qualifications—-first, a sound
general culture, and second, com-
plete command of his specialty,”
Dr. Laing stated.

Students tapped to honorary
fraternities at the assembly were
honored at a Congratulations hour
tea Friday afternoon in the Com-
mons Room. Dr. Laing was guest
of honor.

Twenty—four students received
special awards at the assembly.

Discussing the national inter’-

two members of Men’s Debat-
ing Association will vie with
representatives from the Uni-
versity of Florida tomorrow
afternoon, before an Ainbridge
high school audience.

Sponsored by the Ambridge
high forensic club, Tuesday’s con-
test will mark the return of two
former Ambridge debaters who
now represent the University.

Saul Dizenfeld, C39, and Ernest
Larson, C40, will defend the af-
firmative of the proposal, con-
tending that the National Labor
Relations Act should be amended
to allow the board to have arbitra-
tion powers.

Negative points will be brought
out by touring Gainesville, Fla.,
senior la_w students, George
Smaethers and Ben Krentzman.

President of the University of
Florida’s student body, Smaeth-
ers is captain of the school’s bas-
