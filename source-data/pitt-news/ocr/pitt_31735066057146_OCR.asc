Faculty Assembly endorses retirement plan

By Suzann Gries
News Editor

A new faculty early-retirement plan was
introduced at the Faculty Assembly meeting
yesterday. '

“There will be no mandatory retirement
age for faculty as of January 1, 1994,”
Professor Herbert Chesler said.

According to Chesler, this provision is a I

new step for the University of Pittsburgh.
“What we again addressed was the question
of the need of the institution and the desire
of faculty to have available some kind of
early retirement plan,” he said.

Qaeerjoarnal reflects on first season ’s success

Byjeanne Grol
For The Pitt News '

The Queer Journal will celebrate its first
anniversary this month, and yesterday
reﬂected on the highlights of the past year
and plans to restructure and improve the
show for the second season.

The Queer Journal is a radio show by and
about lesbians, gays and bisexuals which

The current early—retirement plan stipu-
lates that one year’s notice is to be given by
anyone who wants to retire early or is con-
templating entering the plan, according to
Chesler.

But the new plan will provide a four-
month notiﬁcation period from October 1,
1993 to January 31, 1994 for individuals
wishing to retire. At this time, those planning
to retire must present a written contract stat-
ing when they wish to enter into retirement.

The entry date options are: September 1,
1994; December 31, 1994; January 3, 1995;
May 1, 1995; July 1, 1995; September 1,
1995; December 31, 1995, and January 3,

airs every Friday afternoon from 5‘ to 5:30
p.m. on WPTS-FM, Pitt’s radio station.

“The main difference I see lsince the start
of the show] is that it seemed to take us for-
ever to fill a half-hour time slot. Now the
time goes by so fast, we want to expand the
show to an hour. It’s been a year. We’ve
learned a lot, and we're moving on,” pro-
ducer Mark Smith said.

The Queer Journal is the only source for

1996.

Other features of the new plan include
group life insurance at the sole cost to the
University equal to $50,000 with a $70,000
contract salary cap.

According to Chesler, there are about 50
or 60 faculty members who are eligible for
early retirement now because of their age.
“We wanted them to be in a position to have
a choice,” he said.

These faculty members will decide
whether the current plan or the new plan
will provide more advantages for them.

demanded that Pitt

respond to their concerns
over the university’s
expansion plans at an
Oakland Directions, Inc.
meeting last Thursday.

It was announced that
Pitt administrators had
been mailed a list of nine
“Requests for Immediate
Action.” According to the
document, Pitt’s positive
response is a_ prerequisite
“for our continuing partici-
pation in Pitt’s planning
processes.” The response is
requested by June 21.

One of the main con-
cerns involves the pro-
posed convocation cen-
ter/basketball arena. At the
meeting, ODI members
opposed the construction
in a non-binding vote.

“For decades, citizens
have donated their time to
work with the university in
planning its institutional
development. We have
had some success in reduc-
ing the damage to the com-
munity caused by Pitt’s
expansion. But we have
few positive improvements
to show for our work,”
ODI Director Caroline
Boyce said.

Senior vice chancellor

hall snack shop loses its namesake

By Laura Zotis
For The Pitt News

Yesterday Mervis Hall lost its popular snack shop,
Clara’s Corner, but Pitt students and employees feel that
they are losing a lot more.

This past year, the Marriot hotel chain bought Clara’s
Corner, a cafeteria in Mervis Hall. Clara’s Corner is
named after Clara Grarnmer, who has been the cook
there since Mervis Hall was opened. Marriot recently
decided the name of Clara’s Corner will change after
she retires at the beginning of June.

“She’s just as much a part of the building as the name
Katz,” said Sharon McMillan, a secretary at the Katz

school.

N “If it wasn’t for Clara Grarnmer, there wouldn’t be a
Clara’s Corner,” co-worker Sandra Washington said. “I
think that Clara deserves the best.”

Grammer started at the university in 1945. After hold-
ing several different positions throughout the universi-
ty, she taught nutrition classes in the Cathedral of
Learning. While in the building, she began running the
lunch counter. “As a black woman during those days, it
was hard for a woman like me to make it,” Grammer

Davis said.

One of next year’s goals is to
improve the structure of the show
and attract new listeners, accord-
ing to the group

“We should try to do more pub-
licity, to say, ‘Look, we’ve had
some really interesting people on
the show,” Davis said.

Smith also addressed the need
for underwriters for the program.
They would not only bring finan-
cial support to Pitt’s radio station,
but Smith said they would also
“support the educational compo-
nent of the radio station.”

agreement by Pitt when
Sutherland Hall was built, accord-
ing to Boyce. These services were
seen as “a tradeoff for the impact
of more large buildings and more
students upon a residential neigh-
borhood, but has yet to be fol-
lowed [up on],” Boyce said.

Boyce said‘that in her six
months on the job, she “has
found Pitt to be willing to talk to
the community. They have sent
representatives to ODI meetings.
But what remains to be seen is

how they take the comments and
incorporate them in a meaningful
way. I am cautiously optimistic.”
Oakland residents had several
gripes, including the loss of tax
revenue due to Pitts tax-exempt
status. A motion to monitor the
tax issue on a regular basis
passed.Pitt was also blamed for
pollution from increased traffic
and the Belleﬁeld boiler facility.
Residents said that Pitt police
gave a higher priority to Pitt
property than to residential
areas.In response to reports of
Oakland resident complaints
about Pitt police coverage,

Assistant Director of Public Safety
Gary Moses said, “it depends on
what residential area they’re talk-
ing about. City police should be
called for non-University proper-
ty, but any mobile [Pitt] patrol can
be stopped by a citizen for help.
They are responsible as police
officers to respond to anyone
needing help.”

Other issues presented to Pitt ,

for response involve increasing
job opportunities to the commu-
nity, establishing a housing clinic
to advise students victimized by
slumlords, and a commitment to

The student-loan program is also scheduled for overhaul under
Clinton’s plan. Loans would be repaid as a percentage of a worker’s
income. Those with lower—paying jobs would stretch the repayment
over a longer period. Wage withholding might be used by the IRS to
enforce loan collection and cut down on defaults.

Audrey Collins, a financial aid officer in the College of General
Studies, said she was skeptical of the initiatives timing. “If Congress
lets it pass, it will take awhile to stait, but it won’t be real soon,” she
said. She felt a better response. was to “make school free, and use the
money spent on these programs, bureaucracy and defaulted loans,

said. In 1983, the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business
opened. When the building was dedicated, Grammer was
invited by Dean H.J. Zoffer to sit next to Joseph Katz, the
school’s benefactor, and his family. Grammer’s counter
opened shortly after the building.

“Clara had a counter in the comer where the copy machine
is now located,” co—worker Clarence Fullard said. “She sold
coffee and doughnuts, and put the change on a tray.” Fullard
mentions that there wasn’t even a cash register.

A decade later, as Clara’s Corner is about to lose its name,
friends and co—workers explain what makes her so special.

“She’s just a nice person,” Fullard said. “She’s there when
you're sad, she makes you laugh. I mean  she’s my friend,
my mom, and my sister.” Business student Reshma Shah has
only been with the school for a couple of years, but feels com-
fortable knowing that Grammer is right downstairs.

“It’s like coming home for dinner,” Shah said. “It feels good
to go down there and have her say, ‘Hey, babydoll, how are
you today? How’s your family?”’

inﬂuenced the school. She is very pleasant to be around. She’s

.WliDNE$DAY,JUNE 2, 1993 C

The real education President

Fourteen thousand dollars. That’s how much it costs
for an out—of-state student to attend the University of
Pittsburgh. Many students are then faced with the frus-
trations of ﬁlling out those seemingly endless fmancial-
aid forms in hopes of receiving loans, promissory notes
and grants. Most who sign those papers are unaware of
the consequences of non-repayment. Even if they are,
many are desperate for the moriey. By signing one’s
name to those f1nancial—aid forms, one practically signs
away any and all freedom from life without annual per-
centage. Loan defaults and late repayments raise the
cost of continuing aid, and all but limit the amount one
can receive in a given year. Even with the help of stu-
dent loans and grants, it’s all but impossible to avoid
impending debt after graduation.

However, with Clinton’s National Service proposal to
offset tuition costs, all is not lost. With his new initiative,
future college students can repay their debts by working
for minimum wage in various community fields, such as
law enforcement or student teaching.

“For each year of service, one or two years, partici-
pants in national—service programs will receive beneﬁts
that can be used toward past, present or future obliga-
tions," Clinton said at a recent speech in New Orleans.

It’s about time somebody tried to take some initiative
to start a national program to help students pay for col-
lege.

By 1994. 23,000 students are expected to participate in
many important. much-needed jobs. Teaching, environ-
mentalism, public safety, providing care to the elderly
and building shelters for the homeless are a few possi-
ble job fields being explored. Clinton ensures it will not
hamper presently employed people and their positions.
“Participants may not displace or duplicate the existing
workers”, said Director of National Service Eli Segal,

. who was appointed to oversee the operation.

Skeptics of the plan, however, argue that it is too cost-
ly and the risks are too great. Nonetheless the plan,
although a rough draft, encourages high hopes.
Although it may be difficult, it is not impossible to be
carried out in an efficient and effective manner. The
University of Pittsburgh, being a major institution,
should be at the forefront and be responsible for assist-
ing Clinton and his proposal as much as possible.

The benefits definitely outweigh the risks involved.
This program can begin to funnel students away from
otherwise mediocre jobs, allowing them to be produc-
tive and beneficial to their communities in exchange for
a repaid loan. Of course, specifics of the plan would
have to be worked out, and there are no guarantees.
But to fix the status quo, the students and administrators
must now make a serious effort to help change current
conditions and put Clinton’s proposal on paper.

Population Explosion a

The American media would like us to believe
that there are too many people in the world.
The blame for many of the world's problems is
too quickly and too often placed on overpopu-
lation.

According to New Yor/e Times columnist
Andrew Lewis, "the population explosion in
South Asia. Latin America and Africa  leads in
all those areas to overgrazing, soil erosion and
clearing of tropical rain forests." Lewis adds.
“...already 20 million Mexicans living in Mexico
City  half the country’s people. live without
sewers and a quarter without safe water. Can
anyone be surprised that  many Mexicans are
desperate to get into the United States?”

It is often taken to be truth that

and poverty, then those affected only had them-
selves to blame.

According to The M1’/1'tarzt. "it is the unequal
relationship in the world between the imperial-
istic countries such as the United States. Britain.
Germany, France and-Japan on the one hand.
and semicolonial countries—like Mexico. lndia.
Somalia— on the other. that is the root cause of
grinding poverty in much of the world."

The imbalance of power between nations
keeps smaller nations in poverty. But capitalistic‘
countries claim that overpopulation is to blame
for economic despair instead of their own iinpe—
rialistic natures. 1

And  history sometimes repeats itself, the

born. Famine in Somalia, war in
former Yugoslavia, oil spills in
Alaska and other disasters are

news media is once again
perpetuating that stereo-

0 type to expla'n th ro .
Tr r of today. l\lonefl1ve,lers£:

critics give reasons that

often said to be the result of too
many people. But this “population explosion” is
just a myth.

Paul Harvey, of the Conservative Chronicle,
wrote “ . involvement in Somalia has been a
continuing reminder of [the] desperate degree
to which overpopulation can impoverish a
nation.”

He continues by saying there are “... too many
babies, worldwide  the underfed overﬂow is
being turned away in England, V France,
Germany, and Scandinavia  the U.S. accepts a
disproportionate number of immigrants. It is
unclear whether countries like Somalia, China
and Mexico are really overpopulated. Harvey’s
statement suggests that there is a direct correla-
tion between poverty and population density.
But, examining the situation in other countries
can illustrate that population might not be the
problem.

Critics denounce arguments about overpopu-
lation by looking at them more closely. For
example, let's take a look at Belgium.Very few
could argue that Belgium is overpopulated.
However, according to The Militant, Belgium
has an average of 842 inhabitants per square
inch. Yet Somalia, incontrast, has only 27,
China 311 per square inch of territory and
France 268. But Mexico is “crowded” with only
118 people per square inch.

This is not the first time that overpopulation
has been blamed as the cause of the world's
problems. Too Many Babies? The Myth of the
Population Explosion was first published in
1960 by Joseph Hansen. ,

In it, Hansen explained that the “too many
babies, too little food" theory dates back to the
18th century.

It was this theory that justified the condition
of the poor working class. It was reasoned that
if the population surge was the cause of hunger

explain the status quo.

Critics believe that the overwhelming reason
for the existing problems is capitalism, not over-
population.

“In today’s world,” Hansen says “hunger is
completely abnormal.”

The Militant went on to cite that in 1850, it
took four farmers to produce enough food for
five people. By 1959, one farmer could produce
enough food and fiber for 24 people — an
almost 20-fold increase.

Farmers could supply more food than people
were able to afford.Instead, Hansen says, the
U.S. government used this abundance of food to
start a “surplus” program, and, in some cases,
he adds, farmers were paid to stop growing
food crops.

-It is feasible that the “population explosion” is
a myth created by capitalists who are trying to
find a scapegoat for today’s economic woes.

It lets the wealthy and powerful off the hook
for reasonably and rationally explaining why
those woes exist.

It is a very effective, convincing argument to
the everyday American who is trying to under-
stand why so much famine still exists. And
unfortunately, many of us believe this argu-
ment.

We believe it because it is reported to us‘

almost daily. But what is reported is not always
true.

Many “experts” have been proven wrong and
many “truths” proven myths. Columbus proved
that. It should be a responsibility to challenge
the status quo.

Maybe there aren’t too many people in this
world. We need to look more closely and care-
fully at what really lies behind the problem of
poverty.

‘Visions’ a tribute to film’s imagemakers

By Bill Kirchner

Entertainment Editor

Visions Of Light

Directed by Arnold Glassman,
Todd McCarthy and Stuart
Samuels.

It doesn’t take a genius to see the rela—
tionship between cinematography and
photography and to grasp that the moving
picture revolves around the same element
as the still picture: light. That’s exactly the
strength of Visions of Light: its ability to
illuminate the art of cinematography, the
art of light on film, at a level which
requires only a minimal amount of film lit~
eracy to appreciate and still maintains an
interest to the filmmaker or cinephile.

V1'sz'cms Q/‘Light is a tribute. In that spirit
it traces the unsung heroes of film, the
cinematographers, through clips of their
work from Birth of/1 Nation to the newest
generation of establ-ished filmmakers.
There is nothing new about this film’s
approach, a straight—forward, chronologi-
cal mix of film clips and stills of the early-
pioneer Hollywood legends mixed with
commentaries by the living generations of
cinematographers. A sense of the art of a
film’s director of photography emerges
mainly from these interviews. As each cin-
ematographer talks about the work of
peers and predecessors alike, the audi-
ence has the rare opportunity to both hear
and see, through the use of clips, how the
art of cinematography translates into the
images which we see on screen.

Those images have essentially become
part of the fabric of American culture. As
diverse as Gone With The Wind and
Apocalypse Now or the stylized cine—
matography of film noir and jaws may
seem, these images live on and a tribute
to their creators reveals an underexposed
side of our film culture as a whole. That
these images are compiled for us on the
big screen is really a privilege. Filmmakers
Arnold Glassman, Todd McCarthy and

‘Cinematographer Stanley Cortezis work in 1955’s The Night of the Hunter is

featured in Visions of Light, a tribute to the art of cinematography.

Stuart Samuels have managed in Visions
of Light to expose the art of some of
films most sacred and groundbreaking
images from their creators’ standpoint and
offer an accessible and entertaining tribute

to film itself.

Visions of Light: The Art of
Cinematography opens Friday, June 4

The Story Of Qiu Ju
Directed by Zhang Yimou
Starring Gong Li

The Story of Qiu ju, winner of the
Golden Lion Award at the 1992 Venice
film festival, is the fifth film of lauded
Chinese director Zhang Yimou (/11 Doll,
Raise the Red l.antern). Like Yimou’s
previous films, The Story o/’Qz'11_/11 cen-
ters around a strong female character
who is struggling to achieve respect in
China’s overwhelmingly patriarchal soci-
ety. This time the character is Qiu ju, a
hugely pregnant farmer’s wife (Gong Li),
whose husband has been beaten by the
village chief (Liu Pei Qi). When the chief
refuses to apologize, Qiu ju goes to the
local authorities, who order the chief to
give her a financial settlement. However,
what she really wants is an apology, and
she climbs through the various levels of
beauracracy trying to get justice.

This simple and largely uneventful sto-
ryline is somewhat of a departure for
Yimou, whose previous two films have
been passionate tragedies dealing with
family politics. Qizrju is more concerned
with the tedium of peasant life and the
place of the individual in Chinese society
and requires‘ a good deal of patience to
sit through. Watching Qiu ju repeatedly

tell her story to government officials and
get the same answer every time is almost
as frustrating as the actual process. This
aside, it is remarkable how such a simple
story can confront such huge issues.
Yimou seems to be using the simplicity

of the story like an Aesop’s fable, and as
Qiu Ju works her way through the beau-
racratic mire, Yimou works his way
through the characters different ideas of
justice.

The cinematography is also a venture

into slightly new territory for Yimou.
Instead of filling his frames with his
usual vibrant colors and prominent
shapes, such as the vivid rolls of dyed
fabric in jzz Don and Raise the Red

THE Pl'IT NEWS, Wednesday, June 2, 1993 ‘ I Z

Qiu Ju

Continued from page 6

Lantern ’s opulent red—and—gold
rooms, the images in The Story
of Qiu ju are filled with the
browns and whites of winter in
the Chinese countryside. Yimou
still manages to endow this
bleak subject matter with a glow
of its own, leaving his unmistak-
able mark of style on the picture
with shots of the endless rows
of hanging chili peppers and
cobs of corn hanging from the
roof of Qiu Ju’s house. Yimou
also uses cinematography to
emphasize Qiu Ju’s place as a
peon in China’s hierarchy by
consistently showing her and
her sister (Yang Liu Chun) sur-
rounded by people in crowded

marketplaces and streets, rarely

bringing the frame into a medi-
um close-up of Gong Li, whose
face Yimou has never hesitated
to linger upon in films past.

The single time Yimou
employs the extreme close-up is
the last shot of the film, a freeze
frame of Qiu Ju whose quest for
justice has taken its ﬁnal sour
turn. With no warning, this
frame brings Yimou’s societal
study of justice into a personal
one with a single shot, and ends
the movie without giving us any
sense of closure. Unlike an
Aesop’s fable, Yimou’s film
gives us no positive lesson to
apply to our lives. We are left
with the sense that Qiu Ju’s

tenacity has been for nothing
and her persistence has only
hurt everyone involved, and
therefore the governmental red
tape is an insurmountable
obstacle that commoners
shouldn’t even bother to try to
conquer. If this is the impres-
sion that Yimou wanted, so be
it, but it conﬂicts with the tone
the film was carrying until the
end, and it causes the film to be
more of a presentation of a
thought-provoking dilemma
than a solid testimony to the
power of the individual.

The Story Of Qiu Ju begins
an extended rim at the
Playhouse on Friday, June 11.

Matt Serlin/The Pitt News

Pitt News sports writer-turned-Pittsburgh broadcast legend — Myron Cope at the mike on 1250 WTAE-AM.

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

For a student attending the University of
Pittsburgh in the late 1940s, he or she
would have opened The Pitt News sports
section and found as one of its sportswrit-
ers —— zoiks —— none other than Myron
Cope, who wrote for the student newspa-
per until he graduated in December 1950.

This is the same Cope‘ now famous for
his color analysis of the Pittsburgh Steelers
on 1250 WTAE-AM. Thousands of
Pittsburghers regularly turn down the tele-
vision sound of Steelers’ broadcasts  and

turn on the radio to enjoy the quirky com-
mentary of Cope.

Cope’s antics prove to be almost as
entertaining as the actual football game
itself, as he clowns around and banters
back and forth with play—by—play announc-
er Jack Fleming, exploding with enthusi-
asm when action ignites on the field.

Cope’s out—of-the—ordinary but colorful
style did not always fit in with Fleming’s
professionalism.

“I brought a very strange style to the air
and Jack Fleming found it a little difficult
to put up with at first,” said Cope. “Early
on, Fleming was known to storm out of

the booth with a red face during the com-
mercial break. So there were some tense
moments early on.”

Nowadays, Cope and Fleming go togeth-
er like peanut butter and jelly. “We got

_ over those times,” Cope said. “Jack has

accepted the fact that that’s the way I do
the games.”

Myron developed his memorable style
not overnight, but by starting from the bot-
tom of the journalistic ladder and working
his way up. ,

After graduating from Pitt, Cope accept-
ed a writing position with The Erie Times

Women's track lana’s six at NCAA Nationals

By Keith Pompey
For tbe Pitt News

On Monday, six of Pitt’s
swiftest female track stars
embarked on a cross-country
trip to New Orleans. Led by
seniors Allison Williams and
Ronise Crumpler, the Panthers
will attempt to cap off their
illustrious outdoor season this
weekend at the NCAA Track
and Field Championships.

Women’s head track coach
Steve Lewis feels optimistic
about his team’s opportunity to
compete against the best ath-
letes in the country.

“If things go the way they
went all season, there is a

- strong possibility we will come
back with some All-
Americans,” Lewis said.

who combined gave

The group of overachievers,
the
women’s track program its best
showing in qualifying for the
NCAAs, will be led by senior
Crumpler.

Last week, the two-time All-
American shattered the school
record in the 800-meter run.
Crumpler’s record—breaking
time of 2:05.98 seconds
enabled her to compete at the
NCAAs for the fourth year in a
row. By qualifying in the 800,
Crumpler proved her versatility
by being the first Panther ever
to compete at the NCAAs in the
200, 400, 800 and 4 x 400-
meter relay.

Crumpler, who holds eight
school records, is confident she
will place in the half mile —-
even though this is her first

year running the event.

“I feel as confident in the half

mile as I do in any other
event,” Crumpler said. “I get
better every time I run it.”
5 First-year athlete Najuma
Fletcher and sophomore Katina
Miles qualified for the first day
of competition in the hep-
tathalon. Both athletes are
expected to score valuable
points in the two-day event.

Kim Blair, the only junior on
this year’s Pitt squad, will com-
pete in the 400-meter hurdles.
Blair feels there is nothing she
can’t accomplish if she per-
forms to her maximum poten-
tial.

“Even though I’m not going

in as one of the favorites, I
believe I can still do well,”
Blair said.

Allison Williams, the most
successful women’s hurdler in
Pitt’s history, will try to carry
her success into the 100-meter
hurdles. So far this season the
speedster is ranked third in the
nation with a scorching time of
13.16 seconds. If things go as
expected, Williams is expected
to achieve All-American ‘status
by Sunday afternoon.

When Williams completes the
hurdle events, she will join
Pitt’s rnile—relay team, receiving
the baton from Crumpler, Blair
and senior Monica Hockaday.

The Panthers’ qualifying time
of 3:39.11 seconds ranked as
one of the fastest mile relays in
the country. This is the third
year of four that Pitt’s mile
relay qualified for the NCAA
National Championship.

Bucs, Pendleton caught in the act

Week two of the slams and
slip-ups of the sports world
seen through the eyes of the
sports staff of The Pitt News is
dedicated to the bungling Bucs.
The three-time defending NL
East champs have fallen so far
that they are losing bad to the
crumbling Colorado Rockies.
This descent belongs among
the worst in the sports world
this past week.

-80 does Atlanta Braves’
third baseman Terry Pendleton
for pulling a disappearing act
last week. Kinda like his on-
field performance all year. Can
you say .215 hitter?

The move was meant to send
a message to Brave relief hurler
Marvin Freeman because he
didn’t retaliate when Deion
Sanders got plunked with a
pitch. Say he didn’t protect a
teammate? Since‘ when does
Neon Deion’s name fit into any
concept of team play?

Before he starts telling others
how to do their jobs, maybe
Mister Pendleton should spend
a few moments at the ole bat-
ting cage. Pendleton's brain
lock sends the wrong message
via an even worse means.

-Pat Day will lose his shot at
being a jockey in Saturday’s
Belmont Stakes. He was sus-
pended from Churchill Downs
after last Saturdays races for
careless riding. You know, Pat,
maybe the headstand wasn’t
such a good idea.

matescan‘t buy a bucket.

-Wait a minute! Lenny
Wilkens coaching the Atlanta
Hawks? A class guy working
for Ted Turner? Good luck,
Lenny. You’re probably going
to need it.

-Kudos to French Open offi-
cials for tossing psycho—tennis
dad Jim Pierce for “behavior
that was disrupting the event.”

Fans have rights, but is there

a place in the stands for people
known for a exhibiting a hair-
trigger temper and getting into
fights (as he did at the 1992
French Open)? Maybe this guy
and the father of roboquarter-
back—turned-flake Todd
Marinovich should get together
and do lunch. Maybe order a
decompresso. Or a sedative.

0Last year, Montreal goal-
tender‘Patrick Roy won the
Vezina trophy (NHLs top goal-
tender) and came up second in
the Hart Trophy (MVP) voting
and there were complaints.
Nothing but Stanley Cup
Championships are acceptable
in Montreal. No wonder the
guy prefers talking to goal-
posts.

See if the Habs get anywhere
near the finals without Roy
between the pipes.

Cope
Continued from page '8
working at the city desk.
Following an eight-month
stint with the Times, Cope then
moved to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette in September 1951 as a
city desk reporter. Shortly
thereafter, Cope moved to the
sports department by accident.
“There was an emergency at
the sports department and I
was asked to fill in since they
knew I had sports experience,”
Cope said “And I liked it so I

stayed there.”

He wrote for the Post Gazette
until 1960, when he resigned to
be a full-time freelance writer
for national magazines. The
Saturday Evening Post jumped
at the chance to sign him.

“I was already writing free-
lance for national magazines
toward the end of my Post
Gazette career, so when I went
full-time, the Post signed me to
an exclusive contract —— mean-
ing I could still write for any-

The answer to the test question.

one, but I had to give them first
choice,” Cope said. He became
an accomplished writer not by
luck but by solid, hard work.

“I broke into the magazine
field by sitting down and doing
a lot of writing and hoping
someone bought my stories,”
said Cope. “I did this by writing
and rewriting. I am one of the
great rewriters.”

Today’s word processors do
not save Cope any extra work
in his “rewriting” career.

“Even today I do not use a
word processor,” Cope said. “I
still use an old manual-style
typewriter. I am pretty set in
my ways.”

Cope, being set in his ways,
decided it was time to write
about what he wanted to write
about — instead of writing
about what his editors wanted
him to write about.

“I resigned with the Saturday
Evening Post several years later
because with them you always
had to write about superstars,
and I thought superstars were
boring,” Cope said. “I like writ-
ing more about nuts than

superstars.” ‘

“So while I was in New York
to resign with the Post, I
walked over to Sports
Illustrated. I told them I
resigned because I like writing
about nuts rather than super-
stars, and SI said ‘Well how
about signing on with us and
we’ll give you lots of nuts to
write about Cope said.

His writing was so outstand-
ing that it caught the eye of
WTAE radio, which thought
Cope would be an asset to the
broadcasting world as well as
the writing world.

“When lWTAEl asked me to
do the radio spots, I thought
they were crazy, but what I did
seemed to catch on,” Cope
said. “Shortly afterwards, they
asked me to do some TV spots
also.” '

In 1971, the Steelers moved
their broadcasts from KDKA to
WTAE and asked Myron to do
the color commentary for the
broadcasts. This position ended
up being Cope’s favorite broad-
casting job. “In the broadcast-
ing world, my favorite job is

doing the Steelers —— especially
when they win,” Cope said.

But he is careful not to com-
pare broadcasting with writing.

“Broadcasting and writing are
two different things. With writ-
ing, you can read it, critique it,
put it down and read it again.
With broadcasting, it goes out
of your mouth, into someone’s
ear and out the other ear, so
writing definitely gives more
lasting satisfaction.”

Cope ceased his writing
career in 1979 when his broad-
casting career took up a majori-
ty of his time. He found himself
putting in 70- and 80-hour
weeks at times. This continued
until 1990, when Cope reached
his 60th birthday and cut his
workload considerably.

He now works at the studio
mostly Mondays and Tuesdays.
However, this doesn’t mean he
is near retirement.

“I li.ke the way things are
right now and I have no plans
to retire,” he said. “I intend to
keep working until someday,
when I just don’t want to work
anymore.”
