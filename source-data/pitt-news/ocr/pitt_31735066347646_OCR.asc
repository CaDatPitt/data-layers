Citations carrying a minimum
ﬁne of $35 are being issued effective
yesterday to all unauthorized
persons foundin the Trees Hall
complex. _

Campus police officer Ray

' Burgess, who initiated the crack-

down on trespassers, said he is
concerned with the 6 percent
increase in the number of reported
thefts at Trees Hall in the ‘past
year.

When atheft is reported,- Burgess
said, a back-up stluad will be called
to search the building for all persons
without student picture identifica-
tion. Those without an ID will be

‘escorted from the building and
issued acitation to appear before

the magistrate, who will decide the -

penalty. In the past, a theft was
only followed up by a limited" search
and report. 4

All police ofﬁcers at Trees Hall
have the authority to either issue
non-traffic" citations or arrest
trespassers,

“We don’t know who is doing it,
but those lockers inthe men’s locker

room are being hit hard,” Burgess _

continued. _ “These citations are
just a starting point in trying to keep
out those persons who don’t belong
in the building.” 1 .

Lt. Sam Conte reported that 40
percent of crime on campus is
theft. '

“There are too many unauthor-

ized people in the building with all

kinds of phony excuses,” Burgess
said. “I’m requesting ,that all
students bring their ID’s to help us
screen the people coming in. It's
the students who are getting ripped
off, and if they refuse to help us,’
they’re only hurting themselves.”
' Burgess has requested the
cooperationof all staff members,
clubs and teams using the Trees
Hall facilities.

“Coach Bradshaw issued new ID

cards to his swimmers tonight and ‘

the karate club has posted a list of
its members at the main desk,”
Burgess said.

policy fof policing the building,”
Burgess concluded. . ‘

Support for the undergraduate
academic honors program was
voiced by William Lenaghen,
chairman of the Student Affairs
Committee investigating the pro-

posal at a University Senate Council 

meeting Monday.
“The faculty members have
stated they will encourage their

' colleagues to support the program

as well as participate if possible,”
Lenaghen noted.

He did, however, express con-
cern that “the reading room to be

established for honors program

students might unnecessarily
duplicate existing facilities.” .
Jack. Matthews of the Senate
Educational Policies Committee
agreed with Lenaghen on that point

_ and said, “Several of our committee

members have expressed concern
that special preference to honors
students, such as the reading room,
could provoke resentment’ against
students enrolled in the program.”

The honors program would
provide for the institution of ‘honors
courses staffed by existing depart-
ments. The reading room and other

"facilities such as a lounge are

designed to encourage the honors
students to interact with each other,
according to Dave Powers, chair-
man of the Task Force on Honors
Programs. _

“Similar improvements for stu-
dents in general could lessen
resentment,” Matthews said, “and
the elitist aspects that might
discourage input.”

Matthews also said the Education
Policies Committee plans to study
past honors’ programs at_ the
University to determine the reason

..for their failure.

He added the Greeks have been

Meanwhile, Budget Policies
Committee chairman Richard Pratt
pointed out a “balance” would have
to be reached between faculty and
administration before the program
could be successfully implemented.

“Our views are very similar to
those expressed by the Educational
Policies Committee,” Pratt stated.
“Although our ﬁnal report has yet
to be drafted, we have received the
accord of every committee member
for support of the program.”

“But I won't pretend to say where
we’ll end up when we’re done with
the report. Right now we’re
reviewing the various management
principles listed to establish the
new office and -the balance we’ll
have to reach between admin-
istration and faculty,” Pratt said.

Final vote on approval of the
honors program was postponed
until next month’s senate meeting
wh en the Educational Policies
Co nmittee and Budget Policies
Committee return with their
opinions on the program.

PITTSBURGH (AP) -
Treasurer Joseph Cosetti says he’ll

mayor if his name is removed from
the ballot in legal maneuvering.

Cosetti, who last week switched
from the Democr ‘tic to the

tee tobe the Republican candidate
for mayor in the May 17 primary.

“The party of which I used to be

One of the other two candidates
seeking the Republican endorse-
ment has challenged Cosetti’s

through misrepresentation.

The petitions were circulated by

himself. »

So you’re getting your degree and
looking for that perfect job. More
power to you. Literally. You’ll need it.
America will have to find the energy
it takes to make, you a job.

~ ' Expressed as heat, this nation

will heat a pound of water one degree
Fahrenheit. we‘re talking about bring-
ing 219 trillion pounds of ice to a boil.
That‘s a glacier thirteen miles long.
two miles wide and a mile thick.

Every year.

Each working man and woman's
share of our 71 quads comes to
800,000,000 BTUs. Of course all that
energy isn’t spent on the job. Nor do
all jobs take the same amount.
although most spend more than we
think. But when you look at our avail-
able energy and the 89,(X)0,000 people
at work, then 800,000,000 BTUs is

each job’s share.

- Now think about the 18,000,000
more U.S. men and womenexperts say
will be looking for jobs over the next
ten years. At 800,000,000 BTUs apiece.

A we'll have to come up with an extra
14.4 quads of energy to createlnew

jobs for them.

At Armco. we face the energy
problem every day because it takes
about 29.000.000.BTUs_ to make each

to, even though most of Armco‘s
energy comes from coal which we
mine ourselves. When companies can’t
get energy, people lose their jobs. We
all learned that during the winter. The
energy crisis is here. And its huge.

Plain talk about
ENERGY

We Americans already know how to
solve the energy crisis. We have the
technology to reach solutions. Yet each
. solution comes with its own set of

political problems. Natural gas mustn’t
cost too much. Offshore oil mustn't
spoil our beaches. Coal mustn't rape
the land or poison the air. The atom
mustn’t threaten to destroy us. Energy
conservation mustn't interfere with
spending BTUs for worthy reasons. '

Fair enough. But so far, we’re pay~
ing more attention to the problems
than we are to the energy itself. We’ve
got to stop making every social goal
an ideological crusade. We need to
think things through and make rational
trade-offs if we’re ever going to get,
those 18,000,000 additional jobs.

Let's Read, Not Clap

The person who cancelled classes Thursday momingto allow students
a chance to attend the honors convocation and view the kudos bestowed
upon their more worthy peers is a naive optimist.

Itisreasonabletopredictthattheguestsofhonorwill outnumber
those inthe audience, andthat prediction is made without allowing the
possibilityofa warm spring day Thursday. In that case, there will be

plenty of empty seats.

WhenaPittstudentdecidestochoosebetweenlecture andafew extra
hours of sleep, Pitt’s distinguished faculty members often receive the
short end of the alarm clock. Therefore, to expect students to beat a path
to Carnegie Music Hall at nine in the morning to applaud their luckier

' ‘ﬁiends with higher QPA’s, and listen to the 1976 winner of the Nobel
Peace Prize in medicine, is to view this campus through rose-colored

glasses.

It's good for a university to honor its leading students, but why can’t it
be done some Sunday afternoon or evening?

Students pay their hard-eamed tuition dollars to attend classes, not to
attend an honors convocation. The administration should not be
tempting them with the opportunity to be like the lillies of the ﬁeld,

neither toiling nor spinning.

The Lord may look after the lillies, but He often has to work overtime
during ﬁnals week. That testing marathon is coming soon. Once again,
students have been shortchanged with a short reading period before
ﬁnals. Time off this Thursday could be better spent on an extended

Concern or Convenience?

BY GARY GOVERT

President Carter's “crusade
for morality in international affairs’ ’
(as “Newsweek” recently labeled
it) has been drawing a great deal of
media attention. Journalists more
familiar with the largely self-
interested utilitarianism that has
guided U.S. foreign policy since
time out of memory are questioning
the wisdom of viewing harsh reality
through rose-colored ethics.

Following Mr. Carter's criticism
of brutal political repression in
Uganda and ldi Amin's subsequent
house arrest of Americans in that
country, “Newsweek" said, "What
the whole harrowing affair under-
scored. . .was the difficulty of mixing

morals with politics in a stubbornly
amoral world." Pundits writing in
other publications have echoed this
theme, wondering between the
lines whether the President might
not be a bit naive.

It is well-established social
convention for self-styled intel-
lectuals and the worldly-wise to look
down their noses at “crusaders.”
This polarization of idealism and
realism is nowhere more apparent
than in the political arena.- Based
upon their belief that human nature
is corrupt and cannot be changed,
so-called political realists have
identiﬁedwhat they consider to be a
rational basis for world order;
rather than an unworkable notion of
old fashioned morality, they "have

accepted pragmatism and power as
the principles of peace and the
determinants of justice.
denying this wisdom are viewed
with amusement, if not alarm.

This sort of realistic philosopy has
produced some notable results.
Over the past few centuries many
men have perceived an irredeem—
able wickedness inherent in man-
kind. These same men, in
accomodating this depravity, have
fostered such shining examples of
practicality and righteousness as
capitalism, segregation and the
nuclear arms race, to name just a
few.

_ On the other hand, the ranksof ;;
reform-minded crusaders have

included such ineffectual idealists
as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther
King Jr. and Thomas Merton.

If President Carter is to make
morality work, he will have to end
the tradition of serving it up as
topping on an otherwise pragmatic
pie. Superﬁcial morality is derided
as hypocrisy. Cutting off aid to a
repressive Uruguayan regime
means little if the administration
sits idly by while U.S. corporate
interests strangle Latin America to
death. Criticism of the Soviet
Union's treatment of political
dissidents will be roundly ignored
if, for "practical" reasons, the
United States continues to support

_' an inhumane dictatorship in South
 Korea.

begins at, home—if he doesn’t

Even if the President’s concern‘

with morality is both genuine and a
fundamental element in his political
philosophy, he must constantly
guard against confusing the. moral
and the American. Upright as the
American system appears to be
when compared with certain
restrictive dictatorships, it would be
a mistake to think of the United
States as the norm’ for right-

COUSIICSS.

As a born-again, Bible-believing
Christian, Mr. Carter should be
amply aware of this normative
tension—-but there have been other
presidents who have professed
(though with fewer adjectives) a
similar faith and they have aided
and abetted such exercises
missionary imperialism as Manifest
Destiny, the Westernization of
Asian culture and the Bay of Pigs. A
The Cold War deﬁnition of the ‘ ‘free
world” as those countries aligned
with the United States is a premier
example of this confdsion of norms.

Although President Carter has
demonstrated some reluctance to
carry his moralcommitment further
than is convenient, he does appear
to have a real concern for
international justice. He, like all of

_us, has a lot to learn, but if he can

work out the practical problems ’of
policy in the context of moral

, integrity and _a_ willingness ..to:,

“Sure, ’m’lad, the times were
tough. But, sure, they were good
times, too,”they would say. “And V
we only made it by the grace of God 
and stickin’ together through it

So they stuck together, ignored ~
the “No Irish Need Apply” notices
accompanying every job offer, and
went on to dominate the American
political scene’; They figured pretty
strongly into everything else, too:. '
But with prosperity came inde-
pendence, and the cohesive force
that drew the ghetto Irish together
weakened. By the time John
Fitzgerald Kennedy rose to the
presidency, the Irish in America
had begun to step aside. Different
cities had different struggling
minorities and they were just
waiting for their turn. ‘* ‘
Pittsburgh mayor Pete Flaherty
was a holdout. Flaherty‘, the son of
Irish immigrants (his mother: 5,
O—’Toole; his wife: ‘ Houlihan), ‘
entered Pitt on the G.I. Bill, ' 3
transferred to Notre Dame where he
earned a law degree, and yvent on to
grab hold of the Democratic
machine here. But he is leaving
soon and the mayoral contenders
this year are clearly different.
Which is not to say there is
anything wrong with Poles or .
Italians, or that the Irish should.“

which (ethnic minorities pull th\em-r;

The second annual Pitt Photo-
graphy Show opened in the Student
Union's Venetian Room last night.
The event, sponsored by the Pitt
photo club, will run through
Friday.

A three-man panel, including
representatives of the University
and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
and professional photographer
Walt Seng, will award three prizes
in each ofthe nine categories, plus
prize for the most
outstanding work.

The categories are color nature,
potraits, abstract and general;
black and white nature. portraits,
abstracts and general, plus action
photos in both black and white and
color.

“We had 179 entries originally,
but some were screened out
because of lack of space," said

- photo club president Keith Srako-

CIC.

Srakocic said that there were
fewer (23) photographers represen-
ted this year than in last year's
show. but more work is on view
because of increased space. The
photographers are Pitt students,
staff and faculty members, all
amateurs “in the variable senseof
the word."_ Names of the
photographers will not be divulged
until after the judging.

   snag. r1rr*NEws—wednesaay,.March 1-6, 1977

EATURES, etc.

  Not All Black &White

“We want to show that
photography is an art form, not just
the technical operations you see in
magazines," Srakocic explained.
“We want to show the quality of
photography available at the
University of Pittsburgh."

The photos, which will be on
exhibit this week from 10a.m.-10
p.m, include a proﬁle shot of
Mayor Pete Flaherty and then-
Democratic presidential candidate
Jimmy Carter. Most portraits,
though, are not of celebrities, but
of young couples and children.

Nature shots ranged from the
fragile delicacy of a spiderweb

stretched over a philodendron to '

the starkness of an oak tree in
winter to the brightness of yellow
daffodils. There were also the
more traditional waterfalls and
sunsets. There are photos of a
camel being fed at the zoo, a regal
Bengal tiger and an elephant
behind the bars of his cage.

Action photos were basically a
tribute to the Pitt football team.
The season is cronichled in color
and black and white with Tonv
Dorsett crashing through openings.

There is a series of photos of
motorcyclists racing and perform-
ing Knievelish high jumps.

All in all, there is something for
everyone at the photo show.

BY RICH HARRY

College students have a love
affair with traveling. Whether it’s
off to the beach, mountains or
wherever, most students get the
urge to break out of the mundane
daily routine of college life and seek
leisure time away from the stifling
affect of midterms, ﬁnals and
libraries.

But according to Sarah Brown,
assistant director of -student activ-
ities and coordinator of Pitt’s travel
program, there is another side to
in addition to its
recreational aspect: an educational
value. “Traveling is an important
part of broadening. one’s educa-
tion,” Brown said. “It allows us to
see experiences completely differ-
ent from what students read in their
textbooks.”

Brown said traveling can change’

a student’s set of values by
exposing himto conditions such as

traveling have changed.

Monday night's heavy-metal on-
slaught at the Stanley Theatre was
with cotton in your ears.

were as subtle as a sonic boom.
Unfortunately, the sold-out house
sat through two hours of disgusting
punk rock—¥Max Webster and
Cheap Trick—before getting to the

one band, Rush, who is ‘noteworthy

for something other than volume.

Max Webster is perhaps the
worst band ever to set up its
equipment on the stage of a
Pittsburgh concert hall. This
four-man band looks like a group of
cavemen on a week-long alcoholic
bender; they couldn't play for their

By the way, Max Webster was ‘I

F

not pelted with rotten fruit, grimy
sneakers or worse for their schlock
onstage antics. They even played
an encore.

Of course, it must be remember-
ed that the majority of those people
in attendance Monday night were
from a “Teenage Wasteland.”
Members of “Teenage Waste-
land” don't have what could be
called the most advanced "musical
taste. All they want is a crude and
lewd band before them while they
guzzle their bear and .consume
their drugs. Max Webster could
become a millionaire off of this
burned out group.

Cheap Trick, the second band on
the bill, has been causing
somewhat of a sensation in hard

lives.

The lead guitarist and singer, an
odd looking character in orange
tennis shoes, said the band has an

As punk-rockers, Cheap Trick
was not as disgusting as Max
Webster. If the volume is turned
down a bit, so that at least the.
original material is distinguishible
from the typical punk-rock drone
music, it might just click. I

Lead vocalist Robin Zander,
attired in a white bodysuit, was
without question thegmost poised
performer of the night, while
bassist Tom Petersso'n plaved some
nice fills and at least looked the part
ofa rocker.

However, Cheap Trick is a
four-man band. Lead guitarist,

Rick Nielson. can claim, if he wants
to, that he looks like Huntz Hall,
but if he told anyone he could play
guitar, he'd be arrested.

Mareth Films

Trying To Solve a

BY ALEX LEVIN

The evening began with a
telegram'from Herman Mankiewiz
(screenwriter of “Citizen Kane”)
to Ben Hecht, winter 1926;
projected onto the screen:

Will you accept 330 per week to
work for Paramount Pictures? All
expenses paid. The 330 is peanuts.
Millions are to he grabbed out here
and your only competition is idiots.
Don't let this get around.

So it started: me expecting a
night of anti-commercialism, anti-
American dreamism and creations

built on ideas, not people, from Paul
Mareth—the movie man with a
social, artistic conscience.

There were four ﬁlms at this
Pittsburgh Filmmakers viewing of
Mareth’s work—with Mareth pre-
sent—running for 80 minutes.

The first film, “From The Womb
Of the Morning” (1968), was
composed of a series of flashes:-
people shifting about a chess
board, men plotting an assasina-
tion, a couple making love... The
photography was stark and the
images striking. .But I felt too

_ involved in solving its puzzle;‘a

distance existed. -
Resigned to a night of puzzle

solving, I awaited -the next film,

deal.

It would be unfair to call Rush
unprofessional or to group them
together with the above mentioned
punk-rockers. It's obvious that this
three-man Canadian power trio has_
the talent to play its instruments
and a high quality light show to
visually hold an audience’s inter-
est.

Someone should tell guitarist
Alex Lifeson, bassist/vocalist Ged-
dy Lee and drummer Neil Peart
that volume, distortion and non-
stop heavy-metal jams aren’t
necessarily the way,to play exciting
music. Human ears can only
withstand so much. .

Rush started fine with “Bastille
Day,” “Anthem” and “Lakeside

“Two Daughters," made with a
grant from the Swedish Film

I waited for another puzzle as the

woman and her young daughter.
But as I saw the warmth and
closeness of their lives, I stopped
looking for the puzzle. '

The third film, “Fragments of a
Conversation” (1977), produced in
black and white, left me cold, as
possibly it meant to. The ﬁlm
dealt with the chance meeting of a
woman and a man in a bookstore
the woman owns. They were
friends in the past—maybe more-
but now their‘ conversation is
stilted, uncomfortable and ridden
with repressed emotion that means
nothing to them.

The fourth ﬁlm, “Sally and
’ opened in a bakery shop
amid the loaves of bread and
clanking machinery. This film, also
in black and white, allowed me a
glimpse into the lives of these two
women: Jenny, a light-haired,
passive woman;‘ and Sally, a
darkhaired, coarse, dominating
woman. I’m not sure, maybeit was
only the heat in the theatre, but I
couldn't help, feeling the hot

 

Park," but after that the numbing
volume of its assault dragged
everything else down to the depths
of musical mud. ‘

For example, the theme of the
ﬁve-song concept piece, “Z112,”
deals with the prospect of man
without music in the 21st century
and being governed by a cruel
computer world. Rush’s blitzkrieg
pace and grinding volume on

- “2112” would almost justify such a

music-less world.

Undoubtedly, Rush played one,
maybe even two, encores as
Monday night's heavy-metal as-
sault grinded to a halt around
midnight. However, there was one.
critic in attendance who left before
the band ﬁnished, hunting for
some peace and quiet and aspirins
to quell a terrible migraine.

Puzzle 

sweatiness of their summer day
and night in Boston. After work,
the two women rush through their
apartment preparing for a night on
the town. The always ﬂustered
Jenny is given the task of preparing
dinner while Sally prepares herself.
In fact, through that scene, the,-
viewer becomes involved with
Jenny, who seems . much less
selﬁsh than Sally. We wonder why
they hang together. _ -

But then the other side of the
relationship comes out. Their night
on the town turns into a few beers
at a sleezy dive. Sally comes to
Jenny’s_rescue when a man starts
to harangue her. ‘They are both
kicked out of the bar and, in the
heat of the Boston night, I
witnessedanother kind of warmth.
To comfort Jenny after the barroom
scene, Sallyebuys her a scarf, and
Jenny is more than pleased. The
compassion the two woman have
for each other makes for a love that
doesn't care to question or change
who the other is.

After‘ viewing these films and—
then seeing Paul Mareth’s photos
on display, I understood the
importance of human emotion in
this man’s work. I did not go away
thinking of people based on ideas
but of the warmth that comes from

 Sherrill & the NCAA.
This News is Good

    

BY CRISTOPHER C. HOEL

Tony Dorsett is going to graduate (miraculously some say) before the start of
another Pitt football season, as are many of his talented teammates and that is very
bad (albeit very old) news for Jackie Sherrill. But the NCAA, of all people, is ready
and willing and going to,|end the new Panther coach a hand.

Make that a block.

‘An NCAA rule change—allowing linemen to block downfield on a play in which a
pass is completed at or behind the line of scrimmage—should help Pitt more than it
will most teams, considering the makeup Sherrill’s squad figures to have next
season.

The secretary of the NCAA Rules Committee said,"‘This is the major change in
the passing game since they changed the shape of the ball.” ‘While that probably is
crazy—working for the NCAA can do that to a person—the change should make life
much harder for even quick-thinking linebackers who now can hover°in the flat,
unhindered, while determining whether a quarterback will throw or run.

The new rule allows a quarterback to complete a pass behind the line on the
option play; it also makes it harder for the defense to diagnose a play, since the fact
a lineman is charging will no longer necessarily indicate a running play, as it does
now. Linebackers will have to dodge blockers as well as cover receivers and watch
for a run.

The new rule allows a quarterback to complete a pass behind the line on an option
play; it also makes it harder for the defense to diagnose a play, since the fact a
lineman is charging will no longer necessarily indicate a running lay as it does now.
Linebackers will have to dodge blockers as well as cover receivers and watch for a
run. 4

So where does that help Pitt? For one thing, Jackie Sherrill said yesterday that
Pitt will “use some split-back and l-backfield formations, but use the option as
well.” So Matt Cavanaugh, a better passer than runner, will have one more chance
to throw the ball——aided by downfield blockers.

Another thing Sherrill said yesterday was, “We'll need a couple of offensive
tackles.“ That means Pi t’s outermost linemen will be inexperienced——and able to
benefit from an early charge such as the one permitted in the new rule.

And while the new edict won't help Pitt defensive unit, the group won’t be hurt as
much as will other schools. Pitt’s returning defenders are better, faster, smarter
and more experienced than those of most, if not all, teams in the country, and are
therefore better able to handle the new problems presented by the rule.

No team figures to do too much scoring against Pitt next fall, with or without the
benefits offered by the new rule, which now reads:

“No “eligible player shall be or have been beyond the neutral zone (line of
scrimmage) until a forward pass that crosses the neutral zone has been thrown.”

The new words are “that crosses the neutral zone.” Given Cavanaugh’.s passing
arm and the fleet feet of Pitt’s too-large battalion of running backs, that rule and the
screen ‘pass could help Sherrill and Panther followers l‘orget—oceasiona|ly-that
ntimber 33 will not be on the Pitt sideline during this fall's Saturday afternoons.

Well, it could happen once, maybe.

Football Back in Town

BY STEVE SYBERT

it has been only two and a half short
months since Pitt ended its l2-0 season-
beyond-compare and captured the
school’s ninth national title, but already
the Panthers are preparing to defend
that championship. After a short period
of savoring their victory, the Panthers
opened spring drills yesterday at Pitt
Stadium with new head coach Jackie
Sherrill “very excited” about the
upcoming campaign.

‘‘I think that with the people we have
coming back, with the young people on
our team and’ with the incoming
freshmen, the i977 squad has the
potential for a good nucleus,” Sherrill
said, as Pitt kicked off the new grind
with a media luncheon at the Greentree
Holiday inn yesterday. “We have to
find some linebackers and ends and
replace some fine people on both lines,
but I think that if we can do that in the
spring, we'll be fine.” ‘

Sherrill, who returns to the Pitt
coaching staff on a five-year contract
after a one-year stint at Washington
State, has 26 returning lettermen with
which to work, including ll starters, and
also a prize crop of freshman recruits.
He feels a lot of adjustments will need to
be made.'

“Our strong points are at the skilled
positions-—running back, defensive
backfield, quarterback (with Heisman
Trophy Candidate Matt Cavanaugh) and

Sherrill characterized the offensive
line as “decent,” hoping that his opinion
will change to “good" as practice
progresses. ‘Except for Outland and

Lombardi trophies candidate Randy’

linebackers were devastated by
graduation and Sherrill sees many
adjustments forthcoming in that area.

Jeff Delaney, LeRoy Felder and J.C.

__...

Wilson returns intact after leading the
nation last season with 29 interceptions,
though Wilson (more speed and range)
and Delaney may swap positions.

“They have been together for a long
time,” Sherrill said of his most
experienced area on the team. “They
will have played more together as a
group than anyone else. They’re a very
compatible group, too.”

Fundamentals will be stressed in the
first week of practice (20 days of practice
are allowed in the next 36 days) and the
older players willbreak off early while
the younger ones scrimmage. The spring
drills will culminate with the first annual
Alumni Game, April 23, when the
varsity takes on a group of ex—Pitt
players from recent years and long‘ ago.
Players such as Paul Martha, Mike
Ditka, Tom Perko, Dave Havern and
others are expected to perform. The

" game will serve as a Golden Panther

fund-raiser and to stimulate interest in
Pitt’s drive to defend its national crown.

receivers,” Sherrill said. “We will try to

build_.on that in spring practice. We’ll
come out enthusiastically, make some
position changes and throw the ball
more this spring.”

On offense, Sherrill plans to use the
split backs and “l” formations, as well
as certain variations of the veer, which
will be without Tony Dorsett this year as
a valuable weapon.

“We’re going to have to get the ball to
Gordon Jones and Willie Taylor more,”
Sherrill said as a possible solution to a
Dorsett-less running game.

After placing third in a field of 44
teams at the Eastern Regional
Championships, the Pitt women’s
swimming team will send seven of its
members to the National Championships
at Brown University in Providence, R.I.
this weekend.

Among the nearly 400 competitors
from 70 teams will be sophomores Kathy
Stetler, Kristy Elston, Jennifer Price and
Jamie Conley, along with freshmen
Linda Hamner, Diane Kluglein and Sue
Guyer. ,

An All-American in the 50-yard
butterfly lastyear, Stetler will enter her
second national tournament in as many
years, swimming the 50- and. 100-yard
freestyle and butterfly. Stetler met the
national qualifying standards with times
of :59, in the 100-yard butterfly and
:27.19, in the 50-yard butterfly. Her
freestyle times of :24.9 for/S0 yards and
:53.99 for 100 yards also earned her the
trip north.

Hamner will be the only diver to travel
with the Pantherettes. Forced-' to
tabulate a total of 375 points in 11 dives
to qualify for her first national‘
tournament, Hamner barely succeeded
with a score of 376 by utilizing her
specialty dives—the forward spinning
and twisting plunges from the one-meter

“I used to swim the freestyle and
breaststroke, but I hated the brutal
workouts so I started diving,” Hamner
confessed. “I’m in top shape now and
I’m looking forward to it.”

A physical education major, Elston
will swim on the 400- and 800-yard
freestyle relay teams as she makes second
appearance at‘ the —national
championship for Pitt.

“We hope to finish in the top 16 and
that will make us All-American,” Elston
said. “It’s fantastic to watch swimmers
from all over the country competing
against each other. But we have a good
group of girls here that works well and
tries hard and I’m proud to be a part of
th8lTl'.”

Price, another physical education
major, will also swim for the 400- and
800-yard relay teams which qualified for
the nationals with times of 3:43.89 and
7:59.20, respectively. Like her
teammates, Price spoke of All-American
honors, believing all three relay teams

have a good chance of finishing in the
. top 16.

Conley, a veteran of last year’s
national tournament, started swimming
when she was nine years old and hasn’t
stopped since. ,

In the nationals, Conley will swim for
the 800-yard freestyle and 400-yard relay
teams. ,

From a YMCA swimming team in
Altoona to an AAU summer team and
finally to Pitt, Guyer’s next step will be
to New England, swimming in the 400-
yard medley relay.

‘‘It’s my first national tournament
and I’m really excited,” Guyer admitted.
“We have good talent on the team and it
should be a good experience for me.”
