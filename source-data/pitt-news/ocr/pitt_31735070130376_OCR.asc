April 29

Cumpie’s raided again

Police raided Cumpie’s Bar April
29, citing 45 underage drinkers shortly
after midnight. Of the 203 patrons
inside John Genaro’s popular establish-
ment, 65 were under the age of 21.

Genaro, who also owns the Atwood
Deli, said he was receiving unfair atten-
tion from the police, who had raided the
bar less than a month earlier, on April
17, citing 13 underagedrinkers.

Genaro said that the policy of
Cumpie’s Bar is to “card everybody.”

Despite facing fines of up to $1 ,O0O‘
for each of the 45 underage drinkers
cited and despite the possibility that
Cumpie’s Bar could lose its liquor
license after just one more raid, Genaro
was optimistic.

“Cumpie’s bar and the Atwood Deli

will stay open, even if it is fined,” he

said.

Pitt settles with former football
player

Former Pitt football player Demale
Stanley settled the suit he raised with
the University in 1997, which stemmed
from an injury that left him paralyzed.

The then—l9—year-old broke his '

neck after crashing into a padded wall
at the Cost Center while running a pat-
tern toward the sideline during an
indoor practice in March, 1996.
Lawyers for Stanley claimed that Pitt
was required to shell out $31 million in
compensation for what Stanley charged
was “negligence” on the part of the
University and its staff.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service replied
via press release that “The case resolu-

tion is less than one-sixth of the amount 1

wrongly publicized by Willie Gary,
Demale Stanley’s attorney.” The
University said it would, however, con-
tinue to fund Demale’s medical expens-
es, which are covered by a University-
paid NCAA catastrophic injury policy
that all varsity athletes at Pitt are pro-
vided.

Former Pitt professor Deborah
Henson and six other complainants
brought charges against the University
in January 1996, alleging Pitt should

. provide beneﬁts for domestic partners

even though under Pennsylvania law,
they were not allowed to marry their
same-sex partners. The case was
thrown out by the Pittsburgh Court of
Common Pleas on April 20, deeming
Pitt’s health beneﬁts plan legal and
non-discriminatory. ,

Vice President for University
Relations Don Hail said the decision
stemmed more from employee equali-
ty than" from sexual orientation.

“They saw it as equal compensa-
tion for equal work,” he said.

Protesters‘ gather in‘ front of Eat

More than 30 Pitt students, profes-
sors and members of the neighboring
community gathered to protest Pitt’s
refusal to grant health benefits to
same-sex partners of University-
employees at a rally in front of the
Squirrel Hill Eat ‘n Park, sponsored by
the Equal Rights Alliance.

Membersof the ERA and the coali-
tion held the rally in front of the popu-

- lar restaurant to gain‘ the attention of

Pitt trustee Suzanne Broadhurst.
Broadhurst is Eat ‘n Park’s director of
corporate giving and is married to Eat
‘n Park CEO James Broadhurst. '

Protestors led the rally with chants 1

and signs, and even carried giant cook-
ie—face signs with frowns on them, in"
reference to the famous Eat ‘n Park
dessert.’ ,

While protestors charged 7Pitt’s
Board of Trustees with silently sup-
porting University policy, . Pitt
spokesman Ken Service countered
with the University argument that by
extending same-sex partners health
beneﬁts Pitt would jeopardize vital
state funding. ‘ )

By holding the rally during the busy

SGB proposes m

REHAN NASIR

Editor in Chief

During the relaxing summer months when most stu-
dents expend as little energy as possible, the Student
Government Board has expending energy on activities
and changes for the upcoming academic year.

Although only three members have been active over
the summer, President Joan Snyder said she has been
considering several areas for change.

The largest change will be to the fifth ﬂoor of the
William Pitt Union, where many student groups have
cubicles. Plans are in place to build an additional room
for the Asian Student Association and move the existing
cubicles to maximize the usage of space.

Other changes include moving the mailboxes and

adding storage lockers, which student groups requested. A

The ﬁle cabinets are being moved and a lounge area with
computer workstations will be installed. Work on ﬂoor
moves will be done during August and September, while
the additional room and its branches will be built during
the winter break

During the moves, student groups will be able to
assess their needs before spring and determine how
much space they will need on the ﬁfth ﬂoor.

“We’d really like to make the ﬁfth ﬂoor a hub of stu-
dent activity,” Snyder said.

SGB is also pushing to have the Union open for 24
hours. i

In addition to the Union, students will also have
access to The Pitt Club on Thursdays, Fridays and
Saturdays. The club is located behind Thackeray Hall
and now has a Starbucks Coﬂee inside.

“It’s a nice place to study,” said Snyder. “Over the
summer, freshmen were packed in there for live music
and karaoke. It’s something they enjoy and that they’ll
now expect.”

Through a partnership with Pitt’s Center for
Instructional Development and Distance Education,
SGB’s Web site will offer more options for student
groups. The site will allow groups to post events and
related Web sites. Thus, a user will be able to pick and
choose group meetings and events to attend without hav-
ing to search kiosks or phone books.

Snyder has also proposed a change in the fall elec-
tions, to move them to the spring term.

“Most of the campus organizations operate on that
calen ,” she said. “SGB would be more in sync with
the students.” ' ’

Snyder added that new leaders would have time in
the slow summer months to plan for the school year with
administrators.

The issue will be presented to the students in a ref-
erendum that they will vote on during the normal SGB
elections this fall. The members elected in the fall would

entoring program for freshman

then serve interim roles before the new election in the
spring.

Of all the work that Snyder has done over the sum-
mer, she is most excited about her proposed Freshman
Mentoring Program. The program would be an offshoot
of the Freshman Peer Counseling program that is cur-
rently in place to help freshmen with scheduling and
dealing with the transition to college life.

“The problem with the counseling program is just
that you spend almost two straight days with these fresh-
men, and then after that, that’s it,” Snyder said. “But I’d
like this program to continue that mentoring and that
helping, so that freshman have a place to go.” _

Snyder said that support from roommates or resident
assistants may not always work and that the program
would address three main /aspects of a freshman’s life ——
the social part, the general support, and educational part.

Mentors would inform freshmen about various
social events, and encourage their participation . in
University activities. Mentors would also support fresh-
men by helping them register for spring classes. As edu-
cators, mentors would organize informational programs
relating to issues including sexual assault and alco-
holism. A

While Snyder hasn’t found ftmding forthe program
yet, she has passed it along to Vice Provost and Dean of
Students Sharon Johnson, who, according to Snyder, is
very receptive to the idea.

The Pitt News is looking for writers of all levels of
experience. If you are interested, call Dave at 648-8488.

THE Prrr News WELCOME BACK lSSlll-‘.

Freshmen continue to
improve SAT scores

STAFF REPORT

The Pitt News

Pitt’s class of 2004 brings’ increased SAT

‘scores and academic standing to match the

University’s new tuition increase, in an academic
hike part of a five—year upward trend;

Among the approximately 3,000 new fresh-
men entering the University this fall, 34 percent
are in the top ten percent of their high school

' graduating class, and 62 percent are in the top 20

percent. Which are 30 percent and 55 percent
increases, respectively, from last year’s freshman
class. '
This year’s entering students have an average
combined SAT score of 1189, 24 points higher
than last year’s average, and 50 points higher than
the average freshman’s five years ago.
. One of the most dramatic increases over the
past ﬁve years has been in the number of new
freshmen eligible to enroll in the University’s

vHonors College. This year, 728 students — 24

percent of the freshman class ——- are Honors-eligi-
ble, more than double the 340 who were eligible
in 1995, and’ an 18 percent increase compared
with last year. To be eligible for Honors College

V status, students must rank in the "top 10 percent of

their high school graduating classes and have an

average combined SAT score of 1335.

This year’s entering freshmen were chosen
from a much larger applicant pool as well. The

 

 

/gréyrother use constitutes fraud. Cash value .1/100 ol 1e.

 

University received 13,492 applications this year,
a 72 percent increase compared with 1995 ’s lev-
els. .
Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg attributed
the increase in both numbers and quality of appli-
cants in part to the “enthusiastic marketplace reac-
tion” to what the University has to offer.

“The emphasis that the University has been
placing on the quality of undergraduate education
is clearly reﬂected in our efforts to create the best
possible environment» for living and learning at
this University,” Nordenberg said. “Over the past
five years, we have put in place a number of pro-
grams that enable our students to maximize their
opportunities for both academic and personal
growth. Indicators of the success of our efforts
can be seen in both the significant growth in
demand for a Pitt undergraduate education and in
terms of the academic credentials of the students
who enroll in the University.” ' ,

Nordenberg noted that some of the efforts
aimed at strengthening undergraduate education
have involved physical improvements, such as
classroom renovations and new and upgraded res-
idence halls. Other efforts have involved out-

reach, including the Pitt Arts program, and an ‘

increased emphasis on students studying abroad.

“Some of our most important efforts have
focused on the very human processes that are at
the heart of what we do, such as our emphasis on
achieving ever increasing levels of instructional
excellence,” he said.

Where to buy books

MEGHAN FETZER
Contributing Editor

Buying books is part of nearly every student’s back—to—
school shopping and probably the most costly part. Finding the
cheapest books is a struggle with the new resources, like the
Internet, that are now available. 9

Takingthree commonly used books by Pitt students -
Foundations of Biology 1 and 2, General Chemistry 1 and 2,
and Algebra and Trigonometry and Function books — the
prices were compared along with refimd availability and sim-
plicity of buying the books to see which book seller proved to
be better. 9 A

One lesson in price—comparing is obtaining the correct
International Standard Book Number, which is found on the
copyright page of all books. When looking online for books,
most sites ask for the ISBN, and a more accurate search can be

done than with a title. '

The only problem with an ISBN is that it may be confusing
when buying used vs. new books. New books, like the biology
book, may be packed with accessories, in this case a CD. The
ISBN for the package with the CD is different than the ISBN
found inside the book cover. Getting the ISBN from the
University Book Center may be helpful, but just make sure that
it is the right one.

Also, in the case of the algebra book, the ISBN for the
package sold at the Book Center is different than the individual
book ISBN. Looking up the packaged set online was nearly
impossible, but the individual book came up in most searches.

The Thinking Behind The Money.

Staff Writer

When sophomore David Vanyo

arrived at Pitt as a freshman, ﬁnding a bar— .

ber or stylist capable of cutting ‘his lus-'
cious blond locks certainly wasn’t his first
worry. '

In about a month, though, it was due
time for a trim.

Vanyo takes his hair fairly seriously.
“It’s pretty important
because it’s right there on top of my head
— it’s the ﬁrst thing people see,” he said.

An Allentown native, Vanyo was not
initially hip to the _
Pittsburgh hair scene. He took the advice
of an upperclassman friend and went to
Supercuts, where he has been rather satis-

’ ﬁed with the services.

Supercuts may be a good option for
other students looking for
convenience and affordability. Located at
3611 Forbes Ave., Supercuts is open 9
a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and10 a.m. to 5
p.m. Sunday.

Students can only schedule an
appointment within one hour of their
phone call. Prices range from $11 for a
basic haircut to $22 for a shampoo, cut
and blow-dry. 6

‘‘We’re kind of a la carte — you pay
for what you want separately,” explained
Kari Harris, a stylist at Supercuts,

JAY FANELLI
Staff Writer

Growing up ‘an hour north of
Pittsburgh in Greenville, Pa., Jonathan
Ray played Wifﬂe ball every summer with
his friends, using neighborhood backyards

- as ﬁelds and smacking white plastic balls

off houses’ aluminum siding and into the
bushes. '

When he came to Pitt, he
playing. ‘

“I just didn’t know how to ﬁnd any-
one at Pitt who wanted to play,” he said.

So he first pitched the idea of a Pitt
Wifﬂe Ball Club to his friends and class-
mates. VV1th their enthusiasm, Ray began
to research the steps necessary to begin a
student club at Pitt. ,

“At ﬁrst, I was intimidated by the
process of starting a club,”Ray said. “But

topped

once I looked into it, I found out that it was _

pretty easy.”

Many students interested in starting
their own campus clubs and organizations
fail to follow through on their ideas,
believing the certiﬁcation process to be a
long and confusing one.

“Don’t let the process of getting certi-
ﬁed get in the way of starting your own

O‘ clu ,” said Terry Milani, associate director

of student activities.

The first step necessary to the concep-
tion of a new club is deciding on its focus.
And anything goes, Right now, Pitt is
home to a Twin Peaks Club which is
devoted to the bizarre early-’90s televi-
sion series, a Medieval Interest Club, and
an Ultimate Frisbee Club. So Ray’s Wifﬂe
Ball Club would not be out of the ordi-
nary. A club doesn’t need to be serious to
be taken seriously. 

“We try toekeep as many options open
to students as we can, and not be restric-
tive,” Milani said. ' »

Any student interested in beginning a
club must next visit the Student
Organization Resource Center on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor of the Wﬂharn Pitt Union. SORC
handles and approves all applications for

new clubs. -Any student can ‘pick up an

application in the SORC ofﬁce, or apply
online at http://www.sorc.studentactivi-
ty.pitt.edu. p

“Normally, there are only a handful of
new groups applying, but [last] term, we
had around 15 groups apply to be certi-

V ﬁed,” said SORC Manager Brian Urarn.

In addition to applications, SORC
maintains the files for every student orga-

. nization on campus -— from the Vengeful

Spirits Paintball Club to the Student
Government Board. ,

The 15-page application to begin a
new certiﬁed Pitt organization can be

intimidating at ﬁrst glance. The ﬁrst few

pages focus on all of the new club’s basic

Starting aclub is
easier than you think

information, asking students to ﬁll out the
club’s name, address, phone number and
membership. To remain ofﬁcial, a club
must maintain a minimum of 10 full-time
Pitt student members. Without the 10
required members, a petition signed by
100 students will suﬂice.

With Pitt’s population, ﬁnding mem-
bers for the most obscure club may be eas-.
ier than one would think. One of Pitt’s
newest ‘organizations, the Robotics Club,
garnered 35 members at its ﬁrst meeting.
Club President Dennison Bertram only
posted ﬂiers around campus. The club has
maintained a regular group of about 30
members at subsequent meetings.

“I was amazed at the turnout at the
first meeting,” Bertram said. “At a big

school like Pitt, you can ﬁnd an interest

for almost anything.”

The next several pages in the applica-
tion cov,er names and contact information
for the club’s ofﬁcers and advisers, who
must be in “good academic and social
standing” with the University. These
members are expected toremain in con-
tact with Pitt about the'club’s events.

Club members may also request a
club computer account, including a club-
exclusive e—mail address, and Web site

space. Ray could use the club’s Internet A

site to keep Wiftle ball season statistics.
The club is also expected to write an

organizational constitution, a document‘

including the club’s name, purpose,
plarmed activities, membership require-
ments, and a few other miscellaneous
items.

The remainder of the application-is
full of dos and don’ts for clubs. Violating
any “don’ts” can land a club in discipli-
nary trouble with the University. Such
.“don’ts” outline policies prohibiting clubs
from acting on behalf‘ of the University,
from using funds for any non-club-related
events (like buying beer for after a Wrfﬂe
ball game), from discriminating illegally
against any student, and from provoking
any campus disruptions.

“I don’t think my club would incite

. any kind of violence,” Ray joked.

The most important part of the appli-
cation is the Assumption of Risk contract.
This sheet explains that the University is
not responsible for any property that is
damaged or any people that are injured.

Clubs are also restricted from hazing
activities, so Ray can not initiate members
into his Wiﬁle Ball Club by beating them
with yellow plastic bats.

“We’re just trying to make sure that
no club is doing anything overtly harmful
or dangerous,” Milani said.

Once the application is complete, it is
sent back to the SORC ofﬁce where
Milani and other SORC ofﬁce managers

MANAGING EDITOR

As you become more familiar with Pitt’s envi-
ronment, try not to get too comfortable with it. The
University is in the middle of a major period of
development of its buildings and landmarks.

You may lfave noticed, for instance, that there is
a gigantic hole in the ’groun’d..on'the.upper campus.
This is, as you: probably know, the land thatnot too

long ago w&°s::: the foun-drationl of historic.Pitt»

Stadium. . ,

Designed by Rosser International of Atlanta, the
Petersen ‘Center celebrated its '..ground‘ breaking
Thursday, Junel5, and is set to open sometime
around the start of 2002.

The space will make way for the John»M. and
Gertrude E. Petersen Events Center, where the
men’s and women’s basketball games will be played
and where graduation ceremonies will take place.

Additionally, this space will provide a grassy
area for impromptu student activities and will create
a barrier between the Petersen Center and new stu-
dent housing.

The plans for the housing allow for ﬂexibility,
but generally call for three types of buildings: four-

story residence halls; which will .house 50 students, _
three-story "buildings" designed as fraternity and

sororityresidences and a larger complex that may be

' as large as eight stories to accommodate many more

students. V _

The football team also has a new stadium in the
works and a new practice facility in place, both
cooperative efforts with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

While the Panthers will play their home games
at Three Rivers Stadium this year, they will be mov-
ing into a yet-to-be-named stadium on the North
Side that they will share with the Steelers starting
next season. The field is designed by HOK, Inc.,
from Kansas City, Mo., a group that has designed
new ball parks across the A
country for 10 years.

Pitt will have its‘ own,
locker room and offices _for
ticket sales and game‘-day
operations in the new stadi-
um.

The Steelers are also
sharing their practice facili-
ties with the Panthers now
that the UPMC Sports 
Performance Complex is in
operation. I

With half of the South
Side building belonging to _
Pitt, the facilities will house ‘A
a weight room, a rehabilita-
tion room, a locker room
and many offices. Though
some of the offices are not
completed, enough of the
facilities werefinished that

will be a major external company.

Additionally, 72 parking spots and 20 addition-
al handicap spaces will be located in a two—story
underground garage to meet the retail needs of the
building. ‘

Just behind the site for the complex, the
University has put the ﬁnal touches on Bouquet
Gardens. ’ .

Five new buildings have been added on to the
three that opened at the beginning of the last school
year. This student-housing development provides

to students of African descent. The frater-
nity rewrote a section of its constitution,
and was inducted as an oﬂicial campus
ﬁaternity in March.

’ Certiﬁcation brings with it a wealth of
University goodies. Most important in the
Pitt goody bag is University funding. Of
the more than 300 campus organizations,
about 160 receive funding from SGB
through the allocations committee. The

committee has about $460,000 to disburse

annually, so there’s plenty to go around,

_ and more than enough for Ray to buy a

few Wiffle balls and bats.

4 The committee is allotted a portion of ‘
the $60 student activities fee from tuition.

The "rest of the $60 is allocated to Pitt T_V,
WPTS-FM and the Pitt Program Council.
1 Financing‘ through SGB is different

for each club, because each club has it
own ﬁnancial needs.

‘”I'here’s no average funding that any
club receives,” said Sarah Graff, chairper-
son of the SGB allocations committee. “It
ranges from about $1,000 to $50,000.”

In addition to University funding, cer-
tiﬁed clubs get discounts on advertising in
The Pitt News, reserved University space
for meetings and special events, and a club
mailbox. 1- -

“There are plenty of resources on
campus that will help make a club suc-
cessful. You just have to take advantage of

- them,” Milani said.

Beginning a cluband having it certi-

ﬁed is the easy part. Staying successful

requires some work. Milani suggested
making sure a club has enough student
support to stay aﬂoat. Clubs without sig-
niﬁcant interest .die, after. the founders
graduate, so starting a club with substan-
tial interest and lasting purpose is impor-
tant. Also, dedicated members are neces-
sary to provide a strong foundation for the
new club. A

“Draw’up a good plan, stick to it, and
make it work,” Milani said.

Good advice for any student; advice,

Ray can use when he starts his Wiﬁle B_all
Club this fall. Now, instead of hitting long
drives in the back lawn, it’ 11 be on the
Cathedral of I_earning’s lawn.

BOOKS

University Book Center

The University Book Center sells
used and new textbooks, and is convenient
for on-campus students because it is locat-
ed in the Schenley Quadrangle.

The Book Center’s return policy

FROM PAGE 13

allows for a full refund as long as there is '

a receipt and an add/drop form to go with
it.

Some books are back—ordered or sold
out or just take a long time to get ordered.
The advantage to them being sold out at
the book store is that the professor proba-
bly knows about it and sympathizes, the
bad part: they know when the books ﬁnal-
ly get in.

Aside from location, the real advan-
tage to the Book Center is that it has all of
the little “extras” that are needed for the

classes like lab manuals, lab notebooks '

and study guides that may be difficult to
find elsewhere. V i

As for the prices, the algebra book set
is sold for $84.40 new and $63.30 used.
Biology is $87.20 new and $73.50 used,
and the chemistry book is $101.60 new
and $81.30 used. All of these books are
sold in hard cover versions. -

Grand totalfor used: $218.10; Grand
total for new: $273.20 -

VarsityBooks.com I
Online purchasing is more and more

common nowadays, so buying books

online seems to be the most convenient
option. The catches are the shipping and
the return policies Plus, similar to what
happened with the biology book, the
books can be back—ordered and it is hard
to tell when theyxwill be available.

VarsityBooks.com is one of the most
publicized online bookstores and does
boast 100 percent online privacy.

The Web siteis hard to search if you
don’t have the ISBN. After searching for
biology books at Pitt, more than 15 pages

of results come up. Even narrowing the.

search to title and author results in more
than 50 matches.

" The return policy is 30 days from
when the books were received. Trying to

19

get ahead of schedule and ordering books
before school starts may result in unwant-
ed books if a class is dropped.
VarsityBooks.com only sells new
books at discounted prices, but it does
claim that the prices of its new books may
be cheaper than used books at other stores.
The prices are competitive, but not
always better. The algebra book is $92 and
only sold in the paperback version. The
biology book is available only with the
CD, which together costs $96.90. The
book by itself is on back order and costs
$86.03. The chemistry book is $106.75.
Grand. total: $295.65, plus $4.95 UPS
Ground shipping, which will take seven to

j 10 days total.

Campus Book Store

Located on Fifth Avenue, the Campus
Book Store is convenient to on-campus
students and to students in the South
Oakland’ area. The return policy at the
Book Store is that a full reftmd is given if
the books are returned with a receipt by
Sept. 9; Add/drop ends on Sept. 8.

The books that were chosen are used,
so the cost is much cheaper than the new
books. The algebra book is$59.95, biolo-
gy is $59.85, and chemistry is $64.95. '

Grand total: $184.75 '

Student Government Board BookSwap

The BookSwap is actually a national
Web site with a link through Student
Government Board’s site
(www.pitt.edu/~sgb). There is a potential
for resources to be vast, but because there
are so many different books being offered
and different schools involved, actually
ﬁnding a speciﬁc book may be difﬁcult.

The algebra and biology books could
not be found on BookSwap, but the chem-
istry book is offered by two sellers. One is
priced at $60, another seller prices the
chemistry book at $55. Another ‘added
cost is the delivery fee which is dependent
on the seller’s and the buyer’s locations.

The books chosen were basic books
that are sold in mass quantities is stores.
Other books in more speciﬁc areas may be
priced differently and cause different
resources to be cheaper than what is
shown here. '

BUILDING

Even the building newly admitted
students ﬁrst enter when attending
Pitt, the Masonic Temple, has under-
gone $16 million worth of extensive
renovations.

The refurbishing of the new house
for admissions and financial aid, the

FRoM PAGE 17

_‘ center for instructional development
and distance education, governmental
relations, institute for politics, Katz

center for executive education, began
in 1998 and is only now in its finish-
ing stages.

The University originally bought
the white stone building, which is
located across Fifth Avenue from the

I

Cathedral of Learning, from the
Masons in the early 1990s to improve
on a shortage of space. ,

Also in construction is the
Hillman Cancer Center, located across
the street from UPMC Shadyside on
Centre Avenue.

Set to open in 2002, the Hillman
Cancer Center had its ground breaking
ceremony in September after local
businessman and philanthropist Henry
L. Hillman donated $10 million for
the project

». UPMC hopes that the cancer cen-
ter will serve as both an international
think tank for scientists and clinicians
and as a refuge for cancer-sufferers
looking for the best treatments and
services.

Convention protests must

  keep peaceful demeanor

Protesters have ﬂooded the
streets of Philadelphia and Los
Angeles. First they besieged the

Republican convention, and now
- they’ve taken on the Democrats.

They represent hundreds of orga-
nizations, famoirs and unknown,
fighting for causes from civil
rights to environmental awareness.

. The epoch of ambivalence is over.

At ﬁrst these events were tri-
umphs for the American people.
Protesters, young and old, were
voicing their discontent, bearing
placards and standing side—by-
side. The projects were inﬁnite ——
winning rights, dealing justice —
and it was about time we stopped
complaining about them and
inspired some change.

But just as protesters should
be critical of society, society

should critique the efficacy of the

protest.

While most‘ of the demonstra-
tions have been peaceful, many
protesters have resorted to vio-
lence, throwing stones and bottles
at police and trying to break into
the convention by force. Injured
parties notwithstanding, does this
earn positive attention? Viewers
get confused at this behavior ——
which groups are destroying prop-
erty, and which are assembling
"peaceably? '

Many protesters have cited
instances of police brutality, but
this is only notable if the police
action is unprovoked. The protests

are a convoluted situation —— many ‘

different groups, many different
platforms. If people switch on the
news and see rioters chucking bits
of concrete at police horses, they
will excuse tear gas and rubber
bullets as self—defense.

“Also, beware the punk who
just doesn’t care. Refusing to vote

may be hip, but it won’t help any-

one. We hearreports of nihilists
(some Rage Against the Machine
fans, for instance) who care about
neither protests nor politics. To
them, all efforts are a waste of
time. Best just to cause trouble, do
some drugs, and get laid“.

Don’t be fooled: a neutral atti-
tude is harmful. At best, it’s para-

sitic, depending on a system with-'

out helping to support and
improve it. ' /,
You may not agree with a lot
of these groups. Many of them
don’t agree with each other.
Socialists and hard-core anarchists
may offer conﬂicting" solutions to
similar problems, but they’re
marching on the same streets in
front of the same conventions.
This takes a lot of courage, n
matter who they are. -

Tim    de

My college experience isn’t turning out a
whole lot like a college experience should.

Well, as far as academics are concerned,
things are just right. My classes are nearly
impossible, and I always have homework to do.
But- somethjng’s missing.

Maybe it’s because I grew up with a ridicu-
lous perception of college life, one that had the
students always haggling professors and each
other and using a wide variety of domesticated
farm animals.

None of that has -happened. Sure there are
rallies and protests and strange symbolic out-
ﬁts, but I don’t see anybody letting loose 500
rats at a fratemity party. '’

V So now I.challenge the incom-
ing freshman class to put the ridicu-
lousness back into college. And if
you look at Pitt, there are so many
opportunities. For instance, nobody
has managed to ride down 36 ﬂoors of the
Cathedral of Learning on a bike. Is there a good
reason for this? I watch the X Games and‘I
know that if somebody can ride down a ﬂat
rock face with a helmet and some pads, a 75-
year-old building can’t be that bad.

Also, why aren’t more people playing soc-
cer in Posvar Hall? On the ﬁrst ﬂoor, under-
neaﬂi the spiked ﬂying contraption, tl1ere’s at
least an acre of ﬂoor space. Even if a certain
area was marked off with cattle-chute things
they have at banks, plenty of space would be
left for the daily foot traffic.

Another thing: More students should be
throwing porch parties‘. A porch party is when
you get some bales of hay —— don’t ask me
where — and some chairs and set them up out-
side of your dorm. Yep, you just sit there, drink
of your choice in hand and watch the world go
by. '

I don’t recall anybody at Pitt recently
breaking any world records, either. That’d be
nice. Maybe’ something fun like keg rolling or
wax paper eating. I’m sure they can’t be hard to
beat. Or maybe the record for covering a uni-
versity building with duct_ tape. I’m fairly con-
ﬁdent that there are hundreds on campus who
could ﬁnd a world record to spend several days

   
   

.ime;ity Pitt!

REHAN

NASIR

EDITOR IN CHIEF

 

   

' r

or weeks on instead of going to class. Heck,

when I was a sophomore, I had a roommate

who wanted to. set the world record for time
spent in a university dorm room playing video
games and downloading stuff oﬁ the Internet.

He ended up spending four straight days, ﬁnal— .

ly leaving to get a pizza because nobody else
was around to do it for him.

And there needs to be a phantom some-
thing-or-other. Like the Daffy Duck cartoon

when he painted mustaches on all the posters —

and got Porky Pig a few times. Nothing too ille-
gal or destructive, maybe a phantom ﬁre
hydrant dresser — someone who puts small
children’s clothes on ﬁre hydrants
in Oakland.

I’d also like to know why
there aren’t any hard-core under-
ground newspapers. I’m not say-
ing that the current University
publications aren’t enough for this campus, but
shouldn’t there be some form of local irrespon-

‘ sible journalism? Besides, if nobody knows

who you are, then the whole idea of libel and
slander sort of goes out ‘the window. Also,
somebody should at least enjoy having an open,
reckless, April—Fools—everyday attitude.
 Somebody should also try a See-How-
Fast-You-Can-Get-It-to—the-Top-of-the-
Cathedral relay. Perched every six ﬂoors, stu-
dents would try to relay buckets of paint,
batons, computer parts, televisions and water
balloons to the top of the Cathedral. Flaming
torches would be really nice to compliment a
pep rally bonﬁre. I

Maybe what I’m looking for in all of this is
some tradition. There doesn’t seem to be any-
thing campus—wide that ﬁts that description.
Other schools have events like running naked
through campus or building a 50-story bonﬁre.

We don’t have that.

Well, maybe we do. But having an acre of
campus cleared out every year for progress
doesn’t seem to be much of a tradition.

Rehan Nasir is looking for people to start a
mountain biking polo club. E-mail him at

THE Prrr News WELCOME BACK ISSUE

Tuurrsomr, Aucusr 24, 2000

nﬂard time:

In rnid-June, I received something we all dread: a letter
informing me that I was to appear at the Bexar County
Courthouse, in downtown San Antonio on June 29 at 8 am.
for (gasp) jury duty. I honestly didn’t mind, though —I ﬁg-
ured it could be an interesting way to spend a Thursday,
appropriately one of my two days off from my job at the
Alamo. So that morning I went on the joyous commute
from the northern suburbs to downtown, not knowing what
was ahead of me.

I showed up in the jury room at DAVID
7:45 a.m., 15 minutes ahead of time.
Right on the button at 8, a judge came
in and talked to us for a minute. He
thanked us for being there, telling us

_ that he himself had served on a jury six months before, etc.

Then we waited, and ﬁnally they called up a panel of 20 to
report to one courtroom; I was number 14. After sitting out-
side and reading for almost two hours, the bailiff ﬁnally
summoned us inside. My ﬁrst time in a Bexar County court-
room. At least I was there as a juror and not as a defendant

Soon after the attorneys began their voir dire, I realized
that this was a drunk-driving case. Great. Not a civil suit like
I had been hoping for, a case where I wouldn’t have to
decide someone’s fate. Nor was it a capital case like I

. (almost) wanted, which would have sent me home in time

for lunch because my opposition to capital punishment
would disqualify me from the jury. Oh well.

When the ﬁnal jury was armounced, my name was ,

included. To quote Homer Simpson, “D’oh!” The jury’s
composition stunned me: out of six jurors (it was a misde-

  
 

MCKENZIE
STAFF WRITER body)’

meanor case), four appeared under 30. Odd, especially con-
sidering the magnitude of the decision we had to make. So,
I then took my seat in the jury box. Wow, nice — they stand
for us coming in and out — no one stands up when I go in
and out of a room! I could deﬁnitely get used to this.
Throughout the short trial, we learned that the defen-
dant, a truck driver, had been pulled over by a sheriff ’s
deputy one night and appeared to be drunk. He refused the
standard Breathalyzer or blood test, but was still con-
sidered intoxicated because, according to Texas law,
he had “lost normal use of’ his “mental or physical
faculties by reason of introduction of alcohol into the

Sounds like an open-and-shut case, right‘? Not
exactly. There were other factors involved as well.

I First, the man had a problem with high blood pressure,
so he had splitting headaches, and he said he was suffering
from one that night Plus, he said he was nervous when-the
ofﬁcer performed the roadside intoxication tests. His attor-
ney suggested that this might be a case of “driving while
black,” and I agreed wiﬂr himthat his client had every rea-
sonto be nervous — he was a black man pulled over by a
“good ol’ boy” cop with a Southern accent. For all I knew,

‘ it might have been cold that night . Most importantly, the

defendant stood 6 feet 8 inches tall tall! I know that at only
5 feet 11 inches I can be clumsy — I can only imagine how
he mightbe at that height.

Finally we retired to the jury room, and I was elected
foreman (which felt strange since I was the youngest one in

doing jury duty in Texas

vote, and we were tied 3-3. The two Hispanic jurors and
myself, whose politics ' swing a bit to the left, voted not
guilty, while the three other white jurors voted guilty — no
surprise there, I suppose. We then debated, but mainly just
yelled.

Finally we found it boiling down to one ﬁne point of the '
law — we weren’t sure whether we could ﬁnd him guilty or
not if even a thimbleful of alcohol (among other factors)
contributed to the loss of his normal use of his physical fac-
ulties. We sent a note to ﬂue judge, asking him to clarify.

He told us just to apply the facts of ﬂris case to the law
as it is written. It was then that the three of us voting not
guilty reluctantly changed our minds, for Texas — the state
that for years was the only one that allowed open.-beverage
containers — has a very strict law deﬁning_intoxication.

‘ ‘And then we Went home.

But I still felt bad about the case. Many things other V-

than the small amount of alcohol the man imbibed that night
could have caused his loss of physical control during those
tests. And yet the law said that the small amount, even com-
bined with the other factors, made him guilty.

In the end, I’m. molliﬁed because I did my duty as a cit-
izen of Bexar County, Texas: I served on a jury of my peers
and applied the law to the case. If we didn’t agree with the
law, we had no choice — we were part of the judicial
branch, not the legislative. And none of us were daring

, enough to try jury nulliﬁcation.

David McKenzie is still. trying to ﬁgure out how to use the

there —- only 20). First, I suggested taking a preliminary $6 that he earned for jury duty thatday.

So you wanna party, huh?

.   . -

  

In high school, when I used to live in
Colorado, the only parties I went to were
birthday parties with my closest four
friends. It wasn’t until my second semes-
ter at Pitt that I discovered “partying,”
and ever since, I’ve become a true party

connoisseur. I’ve been to them all —.

house parties, fraternity parties on the
hill, South and North Oakland parties,
Carnegie Mellon parties, theater and
even debate parties. Through my experi-
ence, I have discovered that, at the heart
of it all, most parties have two things in
common: alcohol and sex.

Building on these premises, I have 9

come up with my top ten list
of things people should know
before they party:

10. If you want to get into
a fraternity party, don’t bring a -
boy with you. Frats are territo-
rial and only admit girls and close per-
sonal friends. Although on a slow night,
carrying a l2—pack can turn any guy into
a “close personal friend.”

9. Groups of seven-plus people will
not get into any good parties, and will

KAT

immediately be identiﬁed as “a mob _of '

stupid freshman.”

8. Parties at CMU are not places you
wantto be, unless you like bad beer, long
walks and boys that really aren’t worth
all the effort.

7. Guys like girls who can chug beer

3‘ — don’t ask me why, they just do.

6. Never leave a party without
telling the people you came with, and

SCHELL

 

make sure they are OK to get home with-
out you. Make sure, as you head for the
door, that they’re in good hands (and not
with the drunken asshole who tried to
light your friend’s hair on fire).

5. The Gap ads were right: every-
body is in khaki, with little teeny tiny
white tanks, and personally I’m sick of
the trend. Please, when you go to a party,
at least attempt to look different from
your friends, even if just by wearing a
colored shirt. Also, handkerchiefs are
meant for your head, not your torso.

4. If you plan on getting trashed and
don’t want to continually Wait in line,

ﬂirt excessively , with
whomever is. tapping the
keg, as well as anyone who
seems to actually live in the

’ house.
3. Beer goggles work
for both sexes, so if you plan on hooking

up, ﬁnd your prey before you’ve had two I

beers, or your friends will never let you
forget the night you brought “the tro ”

home (I know this from personal experi-

ence).

2. If ‘you see cops, go directly to the
door. Either reenter later or, in the mean-
time, watch the people who did not leave
ride away in the paddy wagon.

1. This one is seri'ous:~ No matter

how cute, sweet, sensitive or nice he ’

may seem, if a boy at a party tells you
that you’re not like all the other girls he’s
slept with and that he really likes you
and thinks that having sex with you

while you’re trashed would be a truly
special and memorable event, he just
wants to get into your pants. Have sex
withhimifyou want, but don’t be hurt or

surprised’ if he never calls you again.

getting jiggy with it. '

Real women don’t need slim waists

This weekend, after a church retreat away
from the hustle and bustle of the world, I ended
up going to some stores,( or “cathedrals of mate-
rialism,” as I like to call them) to look for some
clothes with my girlfriend. It never struck me

before how many more ﬂattering, modern_

clothes were available for thin
petites compared to larger
women. This discovery is not
the only example of society’s
pressure for girls and women
to be thin. Thank goodness
there arestrong women out there that are resist-
ing this societal demand. _
Clothing stores» give -the impression that
young equals thin and old equals extra-large. If
one would mention any of the trendy, modern
stores such as Old Navy, Gap, Abercrombie_ &

GERALD

Fitch, Limited or Express, ‘most of their clothing A

is noticeably marketed to thin women, while few
stores (like Lane Bryant) are around to supply
larger females. Trendy stores aren’t the only
ones at fault, but also more down-to—earth stores
such as J.C. Penney’s or Sears. Why leave it up
to catalogs, Big & Tall and Lane Bryant to sup-
ply plus-sized clothing? This takes away a valu-

_ able customer base from the above-mentioned

stores. I guess they just don’t want plus-sized
women advertising their products.

large propaganda into the heads of men, women
and children. When I resort to watching some
T,Vland surf through all six of my channels,
every single show has a thinner-than—normal
woman. If perchance the woman is not anorexi-
cally thin (Ally McBeal) but larger, slie is either
portrayed as someone inferior or someone
older. ‘

She needs to eat something, I’ll think to
myself in the horror of seeing someone that
either is anorexic, bulimic, or not enjoying
the food God gave us as a gift to enjoy (since
they can surely afford it). Because they’re
famous, they perpetuate the message that suc-
cess, (acceptance and popularity‘ comefrom a thin
bodyf , .

Of course one can’t forget about the males
who have pressed women into bodily bondage.
The majority of heterosexual men tend to desire
less substance per female (in terms of body and
mind). This -should strike me as strange, but it
doesn’t, really. Not to give them excuses, but
they also have ample pressure to pursue slender
women. The. same media that portray popular
women as thin also leave men thinking the same
thing. It is easier to think that a thin woman is
more desirable to go out with than a larger one,
since the guy with the thin girl usually seems to
be having a better time and getting more sex.

pressure from family and friends to seek thin
females. When a guy thinks about going out with
a particular girl, the family’s acceptance is often
considered as part of the decision. If the woman
is heavier, parents may bias their son against her.

It’s easy for me to see how guys pressure
females to be thin, but women also suppress
themselves. Often, competitions are ensued
between friends to see who can be thinner (and
thus most desirable to men). Women often View
this situation as men repressing them when it is,
in fact, women who push themselves down and
deprive themselves of self-esteem and worth.

Thank goodness there are those who break
out of the mold, even if they struggle with its
ever—present shadow. These feminists (I count
myself as an avid supporter) strive to see them-
selves as strong women who don’t let the per-
ceived male-dominated society suppress them.
They often seek to lift themselves up as leaders,
second-to-none among men. They raise them-
selves up as women (unlike “femi-Nazis,” who
try to dominate). If they work out and eat well,
they do so only to-stay healthy, not giving into
our fake, Barbie—doll culture. "

Howto climb — in too many steps

Have you ever noticed that there
are a lot of places with quaint names
that, after you think about it, don’t
logically fit their title?

Squirrel Hill, for instance,
sounds really cool, but have you ever
really seen an abundance of squirrels
there? * "

Correct me if I’m wrong, but
I’ve never seen any more than, oh,
two orjthree beavers at any given
time in Beaver Valley. And maybe

. there are more foxes in Fox Chapel

than I’ve been able to find.
But never has there been so aptly

_ named a place as Cardiac Hill, and
that is not in reference to the medical ‘
Vjmiracles that have been performed

there on behalf of the ticker.

Have you ever sat at the top of
the hill and watched people as they
finish the steep ascent? A person
with perfect posture resorts" to a
pathetic stoop at the hill’s peak;
those poor, courageous dolts try to
force every last bit of_ momentum
forward through their foreheads.
They take longer strides .by the time
they pass Western
Institute and Clinic, thinking that
shorter steps will hinder progress.

‘ A sickly older man who was
climbing the mountain once asked
me how to get to the veteran’s hospi-
tal. I told him it was the top of the

 

Psychiatric"

hill and that he was about halfway
there. His eyes nearly bulged out of
his head. I felt really awful for a man
in such frail condition. At least there

are a lot of hospitals nearby, I_

thought.

But you cannot, in good con-
science, call someone a poor dolt
without having been a poor dolt
yourself. There was more than one
Saturday when some young (read:
stupid) friends and I walked to Pitt

to miss the

' breath, swaying with lightheaded-

ness. A

A But students are an ambitious lot,
at least when it comes to finding
w_ays to be lazy. So I discussed the
issue with some older lazy people
and came up with some helpful solu-
tions.

There are, of course the medical
buildings. Walk in one hospital, and,
if -you have a good sense of direc-
tion, you can navigate yourself to
another through a series of under-
ground tunnels and above-street
walkways. '

. It takes courage, though; make a
wrong turn andiyou’ll likely end up

in UPMC New Guinea (and you
know there probably is one).

If your journey is fruitful, then
you will have ended up at Pitt’s
School of Medicine, which will
leave you where the lower entrance
to Pitt Stadium once stood.

Halfway there!

»It’s even easier to get to that
point on the other side of the con-
struction site, at least during busi-
ness hours.

. If you can sneak into the parking
garage on O’Hara Street across from
Benedum Hall, take the elevator up
to the roof, and you will be able to
walk onto University Drive. From
there, guide yourself to the left of the
fraternity houses and voila, you’re
up the hill.

And your clothes are drenched
with sweat.

Labyrinths aside, there’s really
no ‘easy method to get up the hill,
save the shuttles. They are expedient
when you can catch them, but they
don’t operate all the time and they
are often overcrowded during peak
hours. _

The hill stands at the most incon-
venient altitude — in other words,
too tall to walk and too short to jus-
tify some sort of direct shuttle. So,
an alternative form of transportation
may be in order. Short of petitioning

the University for a Maglev shuttle,
here are a couple of legitimate ideas
for Pitt to consider:

- A chair lift. It- doesn’t really
matter if it is the open—aired kind
commonly found at ski resorts or the
Disneyland—style covered cars, a
chair lift would be the most creative
way to solve the problem. This solu-
tion would have been more ideal
when Pitt Stadium was around, but
the view of the Cathedral and the rest
of Oakland on the way down would
more than -make up for the loss.

- An escalator. At first thought,
this may seem very silly to you. But
have you ever been to the Pittsburgh
Zoo? A covered escalator takes visi-
tors from the parking lot up a hill to
the main entrance. I guess the big
wigs there didn’t want people to
remember the walk to the attraction
instead of the attraction. And keep in
mind, Cardiac Hill is probably steep-
er and twice as long. .

You may think these ideas aren’t
worth discussing, but it’s when you
reach the peak. of Mount Cardiac on
the way to Trees Hall and you realize
that you have already had -your work-
out that you will realize the wisdom
of these ideas. i

As satirical as this sounds, David
Turner really does want chair lifts.

“En route to

We were sitting in my living
room when my friend Brad told me
that there’s a Clown Hall of Fame in
Milwaukee.

“Really?” I said. “You wanna
go?”

“Hell, yeah,” Brad replied.

What, did we really need a rea-
son? We had a car, a desti-
nation, six bottles of Pepsi
and our buddy Fred --
maybe even $250 com-
bined. Plus we had a plan:
drive down Friday after-
noon, arrive Saturday morning, sleep
till 9 a.m., and visit the Clown Hall of
Fame. Sunday we’d drive back.
Simple. . -

First order of business: pick up a
waitress at Eat ‘n Park. This wasn’t in
the original itinerary, but it seemed
like a good idea to Fred and me at
three in the morning on the
Wednesday prior. Melanie (not her
real name) was friendly, courteous
and bored with her job.

“I’m bored with my job,” she told
us, pouring coffee.

When‘ she returned from folding

napkins, I said, “So this is the weird-» .

est question you’ll get all year, I’m
sure. My friend here is a film student
and I’m a writer. We’re planning to
visit the Clown Hall of Fame in
Milwaukee. You wanna come?”

Melanie laughed hysterically. She
said some snob had invited her to ﬂy
to Australia a week before, and she
turned him down. No go. We were
heartbroken.

We picked up Brad at his office
and burned rubber, storming down

.the interstate at 85 mph. “CLOWN

HALL OF FAME!” we screamed at
passing rigs, at people on the small
town sidewalks, at each other. We
took photos of cloudbursts. We
smoked’ cigarettes in front of gas sta-
tions. We read Hunter S. Thompson
travelogues aloud and got wacky
ideas. We decided that youth rocks. ,_

Fred discovered somewhere in
Ohio that he wanted a cowboy hat
and some quality cheese. Brad want-
ed a Milwaukee brew that matched
Iron City (his regular). I wanted a red
clown nose —- to earn smiles and awe
the grandkids and make them ask,
“Pops, where’d you get that?” Then I
could tell the story of my sponta-
neous beatnik odyssey — how Gary,
Ind. smells like manure, how we rev-
eled in the Chicago skyline at mid-
night, how Brad got a room for one
and Fred and I snuck in and snoozed
on the ﬂoor.

giggled and gave us directions for a
half hour. She directed us to every
tourist spot in the Midwest, insisting
that we visit the House of Rocks.

“Actually,” said Brad proudly,
“we’re visiting the Clown Hall of
Fame.”

“Where?” the woman asked, gig-
gling.

. Brad was so shocked
that his mouth hung open.
Where, indeed! Brad had
performed standup at the
Funnybone. He’d studied
Seinfeld and Carlin and made people
amateur nights from
Pittsburgh to San Francisco. Brad
takes humor seriously. And clowns
aren’t just wigs and big pants; they
are Humor Incarnate, the pinnacle of
fun-makers. Sure, Pennsylvanians
hadn’t heard of the Hall of Fame, but
this was Milwaukee! We imagined‘ the
the Hall as a pearly palace, ﬂanked
by marble statues of Binky and
Ronald McDonald. Didn’t
everyone know about it?

The Hall, we discov-
ered, is tucked into the cor-
ner of a big empty
antechamber in the
basement of a down-
town shopping mall.

The whole thing
doesn’t cover half an .
acre. But the curators

use the space economical-
ly; They house photos, prints,
original paintings, mannequins
donning clown get-up, the whole
big-shoed scene. And we were
in heaven.

Our tour guide was informa-

tive. A tall woman with a thick ‘ V

Midwestern accent, she talked about

_the three types of clowns in mild
‘detail. The white-faced clown repre-

sents the circus and plays with the
kids. The ‘ ‘I '
p 1 a in -
f a c e d
clown is
all slap-
stick; white
face always
shafts plain
face. The
c h a r a c t e r
clown (or
hobo) usu-
ally wears
rags and
grainier
makeup.
Hobos are
often tragic ,,
and sad-looking.
“But a
clown’s purpose is i
always :'to bring

ness into _the world,” our guide said.

Right on, I thought.

Then we watched a clown demon-
stration: her name was Melody, and
she was terrible. Her act was to play
Fisher Price instruments badly and
then apologize.

“No, I don’t think I can play the
harmonica, doncha know it. Let’s try
a drum. ...‘“

After bad notes and 26 galling
alphabet jokes, Melody released us
andwe scurried over to the souvenir
shop.

CLOSED. The sign hit us like a
circus elephant. After the demonstra-
tion, the Clown Hall of Fame was
closed till Sunday at 2 p.m., when we

were scheduled to be cruising past“

Columbus.

After the clowns nothing mat-,

tered. The cigarette outside the mall,
. ~ the CD shop
that sold

R&B ,

only

the Clown Hall of Fame

the Bastille Days street festival,

/shooting ‘pool next to a window that

overlooked the river — all of it pales
before the half-enjoyed eminence of
the Clown Hall of Fame.

Two stouts helped Fred and Brad
cope with the clown tragedy. On our

way back, Fred found a $5 cowboy ‘

hat at a truckstop in Indiana. It
clashed brutally with his token
Hawaiian T-shirt.

“You look like a clown,” we said,
giving him a thumb’s up.

Alas, I never found my nose.

As we edged toward the Ohio
border, we started talking about jobs.
“Last summer I applied at Toys ‘R’
Us,” Fred remarked. “They didn’t say
I was hired till the semester started.”

“I haven’t been to Toys ‘R’ Us in
years,” I said’. . “

“Whaaat?” Fred shrieked. “Well
we have to go. Right now. Let’s pull
over at this Texaco and ask for direc-
tions.” »

Two hours later we stepped
through automatic doors and felt the
cool air-conditioned breeze of a
rural Toys ‘R’ Us. We ﬂew through
the aisles, past GI Joe dolls, video
games, retired Star Wars figures,
ranks of. tricycles, drawing sets,
plastic backpacks, the touchstones of
our childhoods. We passed around a

beach ball, compared X-Men rumors, ‘

played a 3-D Spiderman game until

’ our thumbs felt sore, laughing hard. , .
Still" laughing, as we stepped into

the car. Still laughing, as we pulled
into Pittsburgh, just a few hours
before dawn. Laughing that night,
laughing still. '

“Send in? the Clowns” is among

Robert Isenberg’s favorite songs.

How to subvert your way into a job

The semester is going to start.

4 Classes are beginning. Already the

bars of Oakland are creeping out of
hibernation, set again to welcome a
new class of freshmen. All these
developments can only mean one
thing — other than the fact that
classes are going to begin again.
And that is that a number of Pitt stu-
dents will be beginning their last
year before graduation.

At this point I would like to urge ‘

all graduating, students not to stop
reading. I understand the need to
deny the fact that real life — with its
bills, children and countless bottles
of prescription medication —— is just
around the corner.

I understand because I, too,_was

in the unenviable position of being a A

graduating fifth—year senior. But I
now am able to comprehend that the
best policy is not to place your head
in the sand and wait for the seagulls

and vultures to pick at your carcass.
Oh no, it’s much better to go bound- ,-

ing about the beaches and prairies of
this land and get eaten alive by a
tiger or a bobcat. I
I have decided to go out into the
world and find myself a job.
. While I realize that there are
countless books, manuals, training
guides, and inspirational cassette

tapes that focus on the subject of the
job search, I suggest that you take
all of that advice and throw it out the
window. I believe that these job
search engines all proceed -from the
same false assumption; they assume
that there exists a limitless number
of companies in the.world that are
ready, willing, able and even eager
to give high paying, intellectually
stimulating jobs to fresh-faced col-
lege graduates. -

If you accept that this
assumption is false, then
you should have ‘no trouble I
finding a job. '

Allow me to elaborate, ,
calling upon a previous experience I
earned on the job hunt.

I was foolish and misguided in
my youth, and as such, I went to a
job fair in the spring. While there, I
met a ‘man from a Fortune 500‘com—
pany that said I should come in for
an interview. I agreed, subsequently
found another job, and never went to
the interview. -

But I did call him back in May to
suggest that we meet some time in
the future, since I would be a college

, graduate in December. When I called

him he needed to be reminded of

.who I was, where we had met, and

what my plans were for the future.

When I called him last week, I
had to remind him again, and again

how someone with such poor memo-
ry skills functioned inevery day life.
How does he remember to use the

which makes it go slower? When he
arrives at (assuming he remembers

does he say, “Hi. I’m

later, there you were. Could you

My mind recoiled in horror when
I realized that this man‘ held_ my
future in his hands. I now have
information that no one else seems
to know: my fate rests in the hands
of a complete moron.

‘So I considered the Internet. I
thought that if I sent my resume out

some way, someone intelligent
would be at the reigns, controlling

One of the curious phenomena
of the summer of 2000 has been the
success of the TV series “Survivor.”
In a front—page article in its July 8-
14 issue, the venerable TV Guide
magazine described thespectacle as
“a national addiction.”

The reality-based show strands
a group of contestants on a South
Pacific island, where they are
-stripped of the comforts of the
industrial world.

One element of the
show that has particularly
caught the American imagi-
nation has been the diet of
the hardy islanders. With
neither a Burger‘King nor a Uni-
Mart around, the hungry contestants
have been forced to catch, butcher
and eat some of the island’s wild

game. _ ,
Most notably, wild rat.
Unsurprisingly, the telecast-

aways described the wild rodent
meat as tasting like chicken. This

revelation inspired Science Editor '

Byron Spice of the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette to write a detailed article
(July 17) explaining just why the
dissimilar species share a common
ﬂavor.

My rats do nottaste like chicken!-

. I read Spice’s article with a cer-
tain degree of amused detachment.
You see, when I look at rats, I don’t
think of them as food — I think of
them as family!

I adopted my first pet rat, a
retired albino lab rat, way back in
December 1995. i _

Because the little fellow had
spent much of his life in distin-
guished service to the psychology
department here at Pitt,

I decided to name him

after someone with a

J. MAZZA similarly honorable
STAFF WRHER career. ’ Hence, the
newly christened

“Toby” shared his name with the
English .department’s“ Professor
Richard Tobias.

Toby became my dear friend
and constant companion. And I dis-
covered, to my amazement, that this
representative of a most despised
and feared species was, in fact, a
delightful housemate — meticu-
lously clean, personable, quiet, and
endlessly amusing. It became clear»
to me that the noble domesticated
rat was-, like so many misunder-
stood constituencies, the victim of
societal prejudice. - '

I further discovered that there is
a well-developed subculture of “rat
fanciers,” like myself, who are ded-
icated to our rodent companions.
This subculture spans both conti-
nents and centuries. In his 1993
book, “The Proper Care of Fancy
Rats,” the United Kingdom’s Nick
Mays provides a fascinating
glimpse into the common history of
man and rat.

According to Mays, “fancy” rats
(as opposed to feral rats) were
being bred and sold as pets in
England during the reign of Queen
Victoria. Among the famed early rat
lovers was “Peter Rabbit” author
Beatrix Potter.

The earliest recorded English“

rat show was held in 1901, and the
National Fancy Rat Society
(http:/‘/www.nfrs.’org/) remains a
rallying point for rodent—1ov~ing
Britons. 0

Many U.S.-based rat organiza-
tions have also established a pres-
ence online. The Web sites of such

inate information about such topics
as rat health, history and genetics.

Yes, rat lovers have come “out
of the closet” in a big way. And yet,
both we and our furred companions
must still deal with false and offen-
sive stereotypes".

We continue to be haunted, for
example, by the specter of the infa-
mous 1971 horror film “Willard,” in
which a deranged loner trains his
legions of “-pet” rats to kill people.
Bruce Davison’s creepy perfor-
mance in the title role continues to
inﬂuence the general public’s per-
ceptions of rat lovers. A

But together, Toby and I worked
to combat such stereotypes. His
friendliness towards humankind,
combined with his irrepres_sible zest
for life in general, made the pink-
eyed rodent a natural ambassador
for his people. ‘

And although he died in
November 1997, his legacy lives on
in Dewey and Kerwin, who contin-
ue to bring a little rattiness into my
daily life. '

Mike Mazza believes thatfriendship
transcends barriers of race, reli-
gion, or species.

Here I am again, trying to be a
freshmeat -- er, I mean, freshman stu-

‘ dent once more; I am in the god-awful

position of being a transfer student. I
may have 60—plus credits and supreme
command of the laundry room, but for
the next few weeks I will stick out as
theione with the trusty campus map,
the bewildered look, and the too-
quick-to-know-anyone-on-campus
walk. ‘ ,
In my transfer student ignorance I

. am sure that I’ve managed to sign up

for the hardest professor for my hard-
est class, arranged my pre—1unch class

' too far from my post—lunch class to
‘ even eat lunch, and chose the dorm

NICOLE

with the worst showers and
the smallest rooms.
Although I know that I
am most likely making all
these mistakes, there is no
way to be sure until I hear
from someone else how easy their

chemistry class is, while I, having

pulled all-nighters all semester, am
still managing to fail. -Or my empty
tummy makes its presence known,
rumbling loudly in the middle of my
300 student, post-lunch lecture. Or I
walk into another dorm and get con-
fused, thinking I am in ‘a Hilton, only
to realize that my dorm is just that
bad. -\
I might -have a stunning ability to
successfully pull consecutive all-
nighters like every other experienced
college student, but I’ll be doomed to
walk the longest path to my classes
out of sheer geographical ignorance.
Just like my younger and inexperi-
enced peers, I will only walk along the
busiest streets, sticking to the widest
sidewalks, comparing road signs. to

my highlighted campus map in vain

attempts to reach class on time.

A THE P111 NEWS WELCOME BACK lssur.

 Woe to the transferred! p

There are times that I truly ques-
tion the sanity of this whole transfer
idea. I already paid my freshman dues
down the road I at Duquesne

University. I’ve done the whole cam— .

pus map/hard professor/shoebox dorm
room wrap. I spent two yearslearning
the ins and outs of the Duquesne sys-

tem — determining which rules were .

bendable and which were breakable
— where to avoid when my tummy
grumbled, and who to call if my clos-
et door fell off at two a.m. ‘finals
week.

I slowly grouped together the best
friends I’Ve had in my entire life and

(how to put it?) “networked” for free"

copies, free replacements
of student IDs, extra
overnight guest passes,

college essentials.

_ Basically,'I spent two
years at Duquesne getting comfort-
‘able enough to know that it was not
where I belonged and that I was not
getting what I wanted out of my col-
lege career. I wanted a larger campus
— Pitt. satisfied that qualification; I
also wanted more diversity — Pitt
isn’t the cultural Mecca of the uni-

I verse, but cheers to the guy with the

green Mohawk; and more personal

"freedom (I can have a boy spent the '

night in my room!?).'

Regardless of the fact that my fel-
low transplants and I chose the path of
transfer-student confusion, when you
see us around campus, give us come

credit and point out the ‘shortcut to _

class.

in it. Make sure you place your
framed graduation certificate on
the nearest wall. Ask the busiest
manager inthe office for something
to do. If they question why you’re
there, say they hired you. They’ll
likely say something like, “Oh, I’m
sorry. I’m not sure I remember.
Refresh me.” Then refresh them.
Step 4: Two Fridays after your
‘first day on the job, go to your
manager’s office and ask for your
paycheck. If he tells you they don’t
have one for you, act offended. Tell
your confused manager that you’re
irate. More than likely, they’ll give
you a paycheck just to shut you up.
If they continue to deny you your
pay for the period, threaten to sue.

their bluff. After -all, you were

jng a golden opportunity.

Must-see TV from channel 133 up  

For those of you who are moving back
into the dorms, you’ll get to experience
something that most of us who live off-
campus don’t get: free cable. Well, it’s not
exactly free, because you’re
paying thousands of dollars in
room and board costs, but still,
you don’t get a monthly bill
from AT&T Cable for their ser-
vices.

And with this free cable, the
local cable service offers you a variety of
charmels to choose from. At any given
time, you could ﬁnd “Friends” (WCWB
every night at 7:30), Japanese baseball
(The International Channel at various
times) or “The Man Show” (Sunday at 10

Comedy Central) on your television.

However, those are only on the regular
cable charmels. If you have one of those
new TVs that go past chan-
nel l25, you can get some
great selections that are sure
to keep you awake during
your study breaks at 3:30
a.m. Here is a look at some
of those other stations that
you might not hear so much about:

° Channel 133 This serves as.a good
motivator for the Pitt sports fan. This is the
ofﬁcial station of Pitt basketball. In fact,
ﬁom 4—7:30 a.m., it shows a headshot of
former coach Ralph Willard so that intoxi-

   

cated students can mistake it for a dart-
board.

- Channel 169 This station, with the
call letters WXXX, is unadulterated porn,
plain and simple.

0 Channel 187 Any channel which has
a number on the dial that corresponds with
a California -penal code is good in my
book. This one is all murder, all the time.

- Channel 330 For some reason, chan-
nel 330 only comes in after 3:30 in the
morning, but that doesn’t stop most Pitt
students from watching it. Covering a vari—‘
ety of topics from beer to light beer, it
showcases what Pitt students like most,
and that’s beer.

- Channel 400 This station, ESPN4, is

where you’ll ﬁnd such great shows as
World’s Strongest Dog, Lawn Mower
Racing2Day and the International Table
Tennis Tournament.

- Channel 420 I think you can ﬁgure
out what this station is about. V

- Charmel 437 After researching this
channel for a few days, I’ve discovered
that it must be the West Coast feed of chan-
nel 169. So if you catch the. last few min-
utes of “XXX—Men,” and you want to see
the beginning of it, fear not, just tune in to
channel 437. ’

° Channel 575 If you’re a fan of real-
ity—based TV,’ then why not watch charmel
575, which allows you to choose between
a variety of security cameras until you ﬁnd
the one that you’d like to watch. You can
spy on a bank, an apartment building or
even one of the Pittdorrnitories. Sure, it
can get boring when you’re watching a

-bank after closing time, but you never

know when that big robbery is going to
occur, and if you’re there at the right time,
all of your friends will be jealous.

- Channel 666 For those of you who I

aren’t into that whole organized religion
thing, you may enjoy WDVL. The sta-
tion’s promotional line, “Go to Hell —
Channel 666,” may be catchy, but I haven’t
ﬁgured out the appeal behind the program-
ming. I mean, c’mon, what’s entertaining

about watching the highlight video'of the

1998 Pitt men’s basketball team?

° Channel 737 If you’re one of those
people who likes to go to the airport to
watch the planes take off, then this station
is deﬁnitely for you. VV1th cameras at the
Pittsburgh International Airport, this chan-
nel shows planes taking off, 24 hours a day,
7 days a week. If you’re lucky, you might
even get to see a real plane crash. Cool,
huh?

- Channel 976 Apparently this is the
Indian feed of charmel 169. ‘

- Channel 983 I just found this one the

other day. It’s'that Crocodile Hunter guy in

some homemade videos," and lemme tell
you, he’s not hunting any crocodiles.

THE P111 News WELCOME BACK ISSUE

Sick of the bus, literally

In May, I had convinced myself I
could deal with a daily 30-minute
bus ride to and from my summer job
Downtown. I had utopian visions of
a sleek, new 71A gliding down Fifth
Avenue, as riders silently read the
news sections of the Post—Gazette or
The New York Times. The sun was
even shining.

That was before the vomit.

It was in June, when I took a
position standing near the rear of the
bus, next to a young mother and her
child — who looked to
be about 2 years old. It
was obvious that , this
little girl was unhappy
to be riding the 71A at
7:30 a.m. As’ the bus
rumbled. through the construction
site of the new cancer treatment
facility in Shadyside, crawling
toward North Craig Street, she grew
increasingly restless. She cried, turn-
ing in her mother’s arms. V

Then she sat up, her back to her
mother, and vomited. Everywhere.
Pinkish, orange goo dribbled‘ down
her dress, onto her mother’s shirt,
into her mother’s handbag, onto the
floor, and onto me and my freshly

pressed dress. And that’s when I

joined in and started crying too.
Needless to say, I had that "dress

’ dry-cleaned in very short order.

So it was during June when I first
began to dread ﬂashing my Pitt ID
and setting foot on the‘ 71A. I had
endured the creepy men staring at the
girls; I had endured the old women
who covered the seats beside them
with shopping bags after a trip to
Kaufmann’s-, leaving no place for
others to sit. I had even endured the
cheeky high school kids before
school let out, who wore too much
makeup and had’ their portable CD
players, invariably playing Limp
Bizkit or Kid Rock, with the volume
turned way up..

But after the vomit, it was all

2‘ downhill.

I never knew that a fine north-
eastern city like Pittsburgh had a
monsoon season. I had, in the naivete
of my younger days, believed mon-
soons to be confined only to tropical
and exotic locations far south of the
equator. Butxwhat I found out in July
was that Pittsburgh has a rainy sea-
son, too.

L It started raining sometime on a
Friday, waking me up from a sound
sleep with claps of thunder, and
lightning bright enough to illuminate

1 my entire bedroom. It didn’t stop

again until the following weekend.
It’s a hard thing to close your
windows because the humidity from
astorm turns apartments into saunas.
It’s hard to fall asleep during inces-

"sant thunder and lightning, wonder-

CONTRIBUTING EDITOR beueved her,

ing if the power will go out, which
kills your alarm, .and you to crawl
into work two hours late. It’s harder
to wake up in the dark, during the
rain, to get showered and dressed for
work, and then venture outside.
People have to have a lot of
ambition to drag themselves out of
bed under those conditions, and even
more to walk to a bus stop and wait

for a bus that is just going to drive by .

and splash you anyway. I had heard
stories from my roommate of buses
driving by the bus stop at
the bottom of South
Graham Avenue, ignoring
potential riders. I hadn’t

Oh, how I longed for
a car with air conditioning and a
radio of my own.

It’s also not a good idea to start
your morning by eating breakfast
before you get on your bus. Amid the
honking and squealing of tires heard
on the 71A, I overheard more than
one passenger say something like,

“Who needs Kennywood? This is‘

like a roller coaster!” as the bus
careened down Fifth. As I wobbled
one morning, standing beside a
woman in a single seat with a mug in
my hand, she actually interrupted her
8 a.m. cell phone conversation to tell
me to “watch my coffee.” My mug
had lemonade in it — and a "closed
lid on top of it. p

The woman was also sitting in
the section marked clearly with the
words “For handicapped and elderly
passengers.” She was neither. And
she wasn’t alone.

As the summer progressed, I
watched the able—bodied and young
sit in the front section of the bus,
forcing elderly men and women to
cling to the overhead bars like death.
Elderly .women laden with Giant
Eagle bags often stood while men in
suits sat, chatting on their phones,
making plans to meet for happy hour.

These were the same people who
sat on the outermost seat of the two-
seat benches, while the window—side
seat stood empty.

These are the same people who
didn’t understand the point of public
transportation; these were the same
people I wanted to kick.

But even despite the screaming,
the ranting the 60-year-old
woman who got on the bus and
announced that she was pregnant

after‘Va1entine’s Day, but without _

having sex — there were bright spots
in my commuting summer. And most
of them revolve around mothers and
their children.

There was a morning in July,
when I spent the length of the ride

At 25, John Lancia is burning the candle at
both ends. Not only is he a graphic design stu-
dent at Community College of Allegheny
County, but he runs his own record label,
Home—Aide, plays in five bands (Tourister, The
Vehicle Flips, Blissful Idiots, HARM and

, Kisswhistle) and has designed quite a few Web
. pages. Where does he find the time?

The Pitt News: How ‘many instruments do you
play? i -

Lancia: Four. The first instrument I learned to
play was a Yamaha keyboard when I was a lit-
tle kid — it had something like 100 sounds and
beats on it. Now I play drums, guitar, bass and
keyboards. I play the drums in all of the bands
except Blissful Idiots. I play bass for them,
and it’s a nice break. . a

‘TPN: Would you say that Blissful Idiots is
your favorite band, then?
Lancia: I can’t pick a favorite. They’re all dif-

ferent and they all
serve their purpose.
Kisswhistle is more
rock and Tourister’s a
_ lighter pop‘ sound. I
have more creative
input in Tourister, too
" — I _actually write
 some of the songs.
And Vehicle Flips
have been around for
a while, so I was a
fan of them before
they recruited me to
play drums for

g V them.
Tourister suit-
case company will

sue you guys?
Lancia: We were just
talking about that.
We did rip off that
company’s.logo, used
A’ the same color

‘tourister’ also means
‘tourist’ in Danish.

Lancia: With Home-‘Aide records it’s a _little
different. I really like Kool-Aide, but I also
liked the idea of home—made tapes and
records. I did an Internet search and there
already is a Home-Made label — they released
something for the band Pedro the Lion. So that
was out. So I just played with the spelling,
which now brings up a lot of homeopathic

medical Web pages. if you search for it on the A

Internet.

TPN: Do you wish you could clone yourself
and play five shows in one night? I

Lancia: Yes, but not forthat reason. I want to -

form _'the perfect band with me playing all the
instruments. It’s very self-centered, I know.
It’d be all keyboards. Me — all me.

, It’s really easy to say that kids
these days are lazy and apathetic.
Just look___at the people around
" you. Do you see.any-
.«: thing resembling joi de
vivre in any of their
eyes? Probably not.
A few weeks ago, during
one of the biggest logistical
nightmares Pittsburgh has
seen since last ’year’s
. Arrival Survival hit
a’ Fifth Avenue, I thought I
might have witnessedan

Jenn
 awakening. The Rolling
’ ' ‘ Rock TowneFair wasn’t

history in the making as far as festivals go, but it might
have been just enough to spark some sort of, shall we
say, consciousness of what’s going on politically in our
country.

Moby, well known for not being able to curb the
urge to preach during his shows, was giving the usual
speech I’ve heard so many times before —— something
to the effect of that although he was enjoying seeing
female audience member’s breasts, these women were,
in fact, only encouraging the most vulgar of masculine
behavior. Duh. Dicky Barrett told me as much at

  
 
   
    

Lollapalooza five years ago, as if I couldn’t have fig- I

ured it out on my own. I _ ,

But then he changed his tone. Before We knew what
was happening, we were listening to a political tirade.
You know, like stuff we read about happening during

Vietnam, when bands would dedicate whole half-hours‘
to bashing fascism’, censorship and Richard Nixon dur-

ing their shows. ‘
It hit. ‘ -
Men and women, boys and girls raised their hands

- and shouted that they, too, were appalled by the possi-

bility of George W. Bush gaining officegscared by the
thought of women not being able to govern their own

reproduction, worried that the environment would go,

to pot and generally nervous about their. middle-
income tax bracket.

Yeah, these people were the ones who, not 10 min-
utes ago, were either ﬂashing their breasts or encour-
aging‘ the ﬂashing, and they were all probably piss
drunk. Sure, we weren’t in Philadelphia ‘with our fel-
low 20-somethings, winding down from picketing and
protesting the ,unbrid1ed display of consér'vatism that
was the Republican National Convention. But we
yelled, and for a little while,weremem’beredwhat‘it
was like to be young and be -in an '_election year.

It all faded .as the jackass of an announcer came on-
stage after the set and none too subtly trashed Moby
for being a pretentious bastard V.who.do‘e‘%sn’t play any

instruments during his concerts.‘ But I remember the

fire. . . , E

There ‘isn’t much of a local
music scene without a venue; Out-

-of—the—way stages create transporta-

tion barriers, bars exclude the

younger crowd, and a basement —,

well,.it’s a basement._The result is
somewhat inbred: the same people

. going to shows, the same people

booking them and the same bands
playing all the time.

This is what it was like in

Pittsburgh for a long time.

‘ Some people wanted a place that
was more available and inclusive --
people like Mike Roth, who booked
shows at the Peach Pit, a venue
which was located in someone’s
dank,"hard to find, basement some-
where on South Oakland’s side

streets. He felt the need to establish .

a’ musical community and so did a

lot of other people. They just

weren’t quite sure how. _

“The downside of the Peach Pit
was that it was sor_nebody’s base~
ment._But it was a close-knit "com-’
munity, very insular,” Roth said. '

When Mike and his friends

'pDeanna ‘Hitchcock and Justin
Cummings‘ went‘ to a Show in

Baltimore last year, they Saw .a sys-
tem that made sense.
“People were squatting in build-

- ings and booking shows there,” Roth

said. “We thought, ‘If they can do
this, Why can’t we?”-’ -

After six months ofwindow

sh_opping, a trip to the chamber of

commerce and a $1,000 loan from,

Roth’s parents,’ the Mr. Roboto
Project was off the ground.
Here’s how it works: You join

huddle against the wall that has
“Rollerskating” painted across the top

I have never really under-
stood what the determining 
factor is that changes things 
from cool to uncool.

Take rat-tails . for
instance. At one point it was
very cool for a boy to have a
long strand of hair dangling
down the back‘ of his neck. It was even
better if this strand of hair was slight-
ly greasy. Today, rat-tails are no longer
acceptable, except maybe if you travel
with the carnival. Perhaps it is because
of my impaired coolness—perception
that I still love to go roller skating.

Apparently, in the year 2000, it is
unacceptable for a 21-year-old female
college student to enjoy spending
hours going around in circles wearing
funny smelling wheeled shoes while
surrounded by a crowd of 10- to 13-
year-olds ‘singing along to Britney
Spears. I know, my friends and I
shouldn’t be doing this.

are decked out in big pants and gold

shortest clothing possible and whisper
together like football players about to

strange, this bizarre place where life
actually imitates art, that is if art is

You are in thecultural loop  

LAUREN SHURTZ

Staff Writer

‘Tis Saturday night and you’re still hung over from
last night’s luau on the hill. Do you take an aspirin,
squeeze back into your favorite party pants and stagger
out the door? No way!

A major perk of attending Pitt and living in Oakland
———_yes, there is a perk — is that you are only minutes
from a great alternative to the monotony of college life.
The Pittsburgh Cultural District, which is replete with
theater, music and ballet, is only a 61C bus ride away.
Because the symphony, opera and ballet are only for the
staunchest of ﬁne- arts fans, and sometimes they cost
more, we’re just going to stick to the theater on this par-
ticular tour.

The Pittsburgh Public Theater, Pittsburgh Musical
Theater, City Theater and Broadway Series are the city’s
premier theatrical companies. Pittsburgh Public Theater
finds its home in the O’Reilly Theater, the newest addi-
tion to the Cultural District. Completed in 1999, ‘the
O’Reilly features a thrust conﬁguration, which positions
the audience on three sides of the stage. The theater holds
650 people, and many seats offer an intimate view of the
stage. In addition to row seating, there are individual
chairs fixed around the theater’s upper perimeter.

However, the View is not so hot, and it’s a bit like solitary‘

conﬁnement. . .

Pittsburgh Public Theater dedicates itself to provid-
ing a variety of works from Gilbert and Sullivan musicals
to Chekhovian plays so that everyone can ﬁnd something
of interest. The Public’s season includes not only classic
and renowned works, but also the avant-garde, such as

    

  

Heinz Hall and
City Theatre
are all easily
accessible from

Oakland‘ by bus.

    
   

   

   

last year’s controversial “Betty’s Summer
Vacation.” '

The O’Reilly’s modern look and intimate seating,
coupled with the Public’s blend of fresh and famous
faces, makes this Downtown hot spot perfect for anight
on the town. Look for “VV1t,” “Copenhagen” and “Romeo
and Juliet” next season. Student rush tickets are $10.

The Pittsburgh Musical Theater, formerly Gargaro
Productions, performs only the most well—known musi-
cals such as last year’s “West Side Story” and
“Carousel.” PMT offers a great opportunity to see musi-
cals that you’ve always heard about but haven’t seen.‘
Each season also includes a powerful spring show that is
religiously based such as “Godspell” or this year’s “Jesus

Supernatural   kid

“Bless the Child”
Directed by Chuck Russell

iii

ROBERT DITTMAN

Staff Writer

Never adopt a kid with supernatural powers —
no matter how cute. It can make for exceptionally
troublesome social situations, not to mention
unexpected disciplinary problems. On-
screen, supematural1y—gifted children
and shadowy, diabolical villains invite
a tense and intriguing mix. We can
count on tender moments, weird hap-
penings, kidnappings and breakneck
chases before someone triumphs.

So it is with “Bless the Child,” the new
occult thriller with loads of potential. Practical,
well—ordered emergency room nurse Maggie
O’Connor (Kim Basinger) inherits her wayward
sister’s (Angela Bettis) autistic child, Cody
(Holliston Coleman). Soon she develops a real
maternal attachment to Cody, not realizing she has
gotten herself into a more threatening situation than
she imagined; a veritable custody battle with Satan.

Bad guys, headed by Britishthespian Rufus
Sewell (Eric Stark), want Cody for her powers of
telekinesis, magical healing and the incidental abil-
ity to control and manipulate unimaginable powers
of evil. When children born on Dec. 16 of a certain
year start disappearing under mysterious circum-

 
  
  
 
 

specializing in occult crime, gets assigned to the
case.
This should have been an absolutely riveting

horror, even if only for genre fans. Oddly, many of 

the film’s strongest points misfire. Smits, an
“NYPD Blue” alumnus, has a detective role that
should fit him like a well—wom glove. Instead he
often looks awkward, even bored, meandering
around the squad room and various crime scenes.
It’s difficult to imagine what might have drawn

proven screen veteran Basinger to this project, ‘

even given that a film. can be destroyed in the edit-
ing room. Versatile and V daring Christina Ricci

(Cheri) is prematurely discarded

as a warning beacon.

atmosphere, cryptic messages, winged humanoids

and a freakish assortment of characters and plot sit-_- 
uations.\lV1th all the extras, Coleman is reduced to

looking
adorable and innocent, even when her telekinesis is
on high.

It would be unfair to say that nothing works in
“Bless the Child.” Several scenes are both gripping
and chilling and hold one’s interest. But so much
seems to be formulaic padding — a kind of if—this-
doesn’t—work-maybe-this—will philosophy.

There’s another conﬂict, however — whether

‘ breaking rap, but Brick Livin doesn’t

Live through this

Album: Brick Livin
Artist: Mr. Marcelo
Label: No Limit

*

OLIVER B. JOHNSON III
The Pitt News '

The ﬁrst full album by Mr. Marce1o,Bn'ck Livin, has
hit the streets, but unfortunately it didn’t break in the
process. If‘ you like loud noise with lackluster beats, then
this is a great album “for you.

Not that No Limit is known for ingenious ground-

even have what’s expected
from No Limit, and I have
learned not to expect
much. Brick Livin starts
out with a lot of loud
unemotional tracks and ﬁn-
ishes sounding like Mr.
Marcelo is having a yelling contest
— if this was the case, they would win ﬁrst place every
time. A

It’s too bad you can only listen to how “r ” someone
is for so long. “Soldiers for Life” is one of the few tracks

A in which the sex life of Mr. Marcelo isn’t the topic'of the
conversatiemalthough thebeatgin ‘r‘Street-‘1if_e”Vmakes me 
thinkof that Nintendo game ‘~‘W1zards &TWarriors,” which
isn’t a bad  S'till,ithe're isn’t enough powerin any one V’

ANDREW BECKERMAN
The Pitt News

If this review were a Thomas Pynchon
novel, it would probably begin with an
explanation of psychedelic.—p0p’s place in
‘90s popular culture and ﬂashback a couple
times to sometime in the ‘60s.~ However, the
story does not need to be so complex. »

Psych-pop, made "famous by such
bands as the Beaﬂes, The Byrds and Os

Mutantes, was king of thehill back in the ,

late ‘60s and early ‘70s. The genre enjoyed
much popularity among mainstream audi-
ences partly due to an acceptance of the
bands’ earlier, more accessible work and
‘partly due to an association with revolu-
tion. Fast forward 30 years and one
ﬁnds the purveyors of psychedelia rele-
gated to the fringes of rock, where The
Olivia Tremor Control sits triumphantly on
the throne.

Part of the Elephant 6 Recording

, Company, an Athens, Ga-based collection

of like-minded friends, the Olivias‘ have
been releasing ﬂieir ,‘60s—pop inﬂuenced

\

rock since 1993. Since that time,_t.’ney have '/

released two full-length albums plus numer-
ous singles, and now have collected those
singles (and many compilation appearances)
on one album: The Olivia Tremor Control
Presents Singles and Beyond Released on
Kindercore, which seem to have a penchant
for releasing Elephant 6 singles compila-
tions, Singles and Beyond was meant to pro-
vide the ardent-but-poor fan of the Olivias
with a chance to hear. all of their earlier mate-
rial without having to pay collectors’ prices
for them ’

For the most part, thealbum is what one ,

would expect from the band: three-minute
pop tunes full of fuzzed out guitars and beau-
tiful harmonies interspersed with sound col-
lages of varying length. Being a compilation

of ﬁve years of their work, one can View the ‘

« evolution of their songwriting, from simple,
Gerbils-y pop to more complex songs that
combine traditional structures with more
complex sound experiments. Fit into the net-
work of their two albums, Dusk at Cubist
Castle and Black Foliage, Singles and

Album: Trapped in Crime

Artist: C-Murder
Label: No Limit

cit

OLIVER B. JOHNSON III

Tnuksnnv, Aucusr 24, 2000

usual gangsta talk and Tupac-inspired
beats —— if that’s what they call biting
these days. C-Murder, one of No
Limit’s premiere rappers (which isn’t
saying much), is back with his third
album, Trapped in Crime. ,

The 23-song album is the first
release on C—Murder’s own Tru
Records label, under No Limits’ own
label. While this isn’t an excessively
terrible album, it doesn’t have the
edge needed to clear any major rap

The Pm News hurdles, which has been No Limit’s
story from the beginning.
After a brief  Although No Limit’s

absence from the
hip-hop scene,
No Limit has
come out with
yet another
album full of the

 
  
  

. artists make a few
 ; good dance songs
 in 7' I here and there,
they can’t seem to
 come up with any-
thing new. But I guess

   

the “if it ain’t broke,
don’t fix it” motto is something No
Limit holds in high esteem.
I can honestly say that this is one
of No Limit’s better ‘albums. The
beats remind me of Tupac’s All Eyes
On Me, which is one of the best rap
albums of all time. Trapped in Crime
features the entire No Limit gang —
appearances by Snoop Dogg, Master
P, Silkk the Shocker, Mystikal, Magic,

You just met your roomate andhe has
a picture of his mom on the wall...

Keep Smiling

Eastsidaz lend a hand in making this a
decent album; Though its gangsta ref-
erences of_ sex, money and murder
‘ consistently repeat and start to wear.

The intro track sounds so much
like Tupac that I had to check to make
sure I didn’t put in the wrong CD. I’m
always saying I wish there were more
rappers like him, but I don’t mean I
wish there were more rappers who
pretended to be Pac. I guess I have to
watch what I wish for (just listen_ to
the vocals on “Down 4 My Niggaz”).

Although this isn’t the greatest
rap -album, it should please all the N 0
Limit fans out there — I’ve all
learned by now it doesn’t take much
to do that. I wouldn’t be too surprised
if a few of Trapped in Crime’s tracks
become party favorites, at least until
something better comes along.

Let’s hope we don’t haveto wait

go into outer space after NASA took over
the space program and sent a chimpanzee
instead. It was a charming chimp, but a
chimp nonetheless.

. An important Russian satellite is
falling out of orbit and stands to do some
earthbound damage. It has been function-

ing by means of a stolen Russian comput-
’ er program developed by aging Team

Daedalus space pioneer Frank Corvin
(Clint Eastwood), one of four promising
pilots who never
got over not
taking a
trip to

W e
m e e t
barnstorm-
ing daredevil
_ Hank Hawkins "(Tommy
Lee Jones), priest Tank Sullivan (James
Garner) and_ long—in-the-tooth lover Jerry
O’Neil (Donald Sutherland) — team avi-
ation pioneers and incurable aeronautic
renegades. Now only Corvin can ﬁx the
clunky satellite because he knows the
technology best, and he’s only going up if
his friends can come along, too.

At Corvin’s insistence, after rigorous
training,‘ the original team will go into
space together, or the satellite can fall to
the ground and go crunch, for all he cares.
Please ignore the obvious high-tech solu-
tion of blasting the living daylights out of

' the satellite with some sort of cool space

gun — it’s a movie, remember, and
Daddy Clint’s movie at that. Otherwise,
the audience would be cheated out of two
hours and twelve minutes of worth of

‘laughs, and a few past prime bare butts.

The ﬂy-boys do things their way and
are remarkably skilled at handling new-
fangled equipment. To no one’s surprise
the superbrass has a devious ace or two
up their sleeves. Screen vet James
Cromwell (Bob Gerson) gets a chance to
huff and scowl as Corvin’s longtime,
ﬂinty chief nemesis. Marcia .Gay Harden
(Sara Holland) plays a NASA specialist
with a heart. None of the hipsters would
complain about being marooned in a
wayward space capsule with Ms. Harden
—- she is the romantic fate of crusty Hank
Hawkins during training.

It’s hard not to howl at these official-
ly over—the-hill astronauts still powered

‘by pure spunk. Director Eastwood’s

tongue-in-cheek approach keeps, the pic-
ture ﬂowing, and it’s hysterical watching
Eastwood and company upstage well-
trained pros with nothing more than seat-
of—the pants space experience.

Medicare, age, and body function
jokes are abundant. An Ensure toast at the
cafeteria table ; is a truly nice touch.

Replete with colorful characters, the-
script mostly sparkles — belly laughs are ‘-

so frequent we can even forgive the
stretch in Eastwood’s choice of endings.
Never intended as a NASA documentary,
“Space Cowboys” works best, and even

hilariously, when it is earthbound, which, .

fortimately, is most of the time.

THEATER

Christ Superstar.” Student rush is $14.

Tom Schaller, Sharon Connelly-
Schaller and Anthony Marino are three
stellar and versatile members of PMT’s
company. Because many of the same
actors are cast in all PMT productions,
you feel you know the actors after only
two shows, even though the seemingly
closed company of actors and handful of
upstairs have a distinct chemistry that
allows them to constantly reinvent them-
selves.

The majority of PMT’s productions
are at the Byham Theater, a few blocks
from the cultural center of Downtown.
The Byham Theater, Benedum Center for
Performing Arts and Heinz Hall all have a
similar. facade, so it might be hard to ﬁg-

FROM PAGE 40

ure out which one is which. Even after
massive renovation, the Byham still lacks
a sparkle that could distinguish it from the
others.

The best drama in Pittsburgh is care-
fully tucked among bars and homes at the
comer of 13th and Bingham streets in the
South Side, miles from the Cultural
District. The City Theater is a small
venue, seating only a few hundred people.
With yellow and green sponged walls, the
theater is simple yet funky.

_ Much of the theater’s lower level is a
cafe; the house is upstairs. The cafe’s
decor, based largely on the current show,
changes constantly and adds another
dimension to the theater. You do not need
a ticket to get into this area, which makes
it a perfect place for a cup of hot chocolate
or a bottle of beer, even if you’re not
attending a performance.

Although one ﬁnds the occasional
familiar play, City Theater is a place for
introducing new shows and world pre-

rniers. Each fresh work is unique and
worthwhile by its own right. Expect major
drama, conﬂict and emotion fused with
the bizarre and absurd.

Even more unique than the works
themselves is the theater’s staging.
Moveable seats allow the scene director to
completely alter the position of the stage
and audience. No matter where you ﬁnd
yourself in relation to the stage, every seat
in the house is up—close and fantastic. City
Theater leaves its audiences befuddled yet
introspective. Its works are powerful and
not to be missed. Student rush is half
price, usually $14". , A

The most elaborate, professional and
spectacular theater in Pittsburgh is the
Broadway Series. As its name suggests,
the Broadway Series features big—name
shows. Although last year’s season, which
included “Fosse,” “Titanic” and
“Ragtime” will be hard to outdo, this
year’s casts and crews of “Rent,” “The
Sound of Music” and “Fame,” among
others, will try.

Because little from any Broadway
Series production is genuinely Pittsburgh,
it cannot rightfully be compared to the
more indigenous companies like the City
Theater and Pittsburgh Musical Theater.
The cast and crew, lighting and sound

technicians, and scenery and costumes are W

all part of traveling companies that arrive
in Pittsburgh, leave their mark, and quick-
ly move on.

Broadway Series productions are‘

expensive; there are no student discounts
and ' tickets are often $40 - or more.
Although this type of theater is not eco-
nomically feasible for the typical college
student,-the splurge makes for a great spe-
cial occasion.’ The acting and singing
impress, the lighting, sound and scenery
amaze, and the costumes dazzle. '
The Benedum Center and Heinz Hall
both house the Broadway Series. Each
theater is equally impressive with its
winding staircases, gilded ornamentation
and expansive house. i
Many students, whether from
Pittsburgh or elsewhere, aren’t aware of
theaffordable and accessible theater that
is only I'IllIl11t€S< away. And contrary to
popular belief, college can consist of more

. than Natty Lite beer and Papa John’s

pizza. See a show. Open your mind. Get
some culture. A -

The renting fees go directly to

And, Roth paid back his parents in

The downside is that the board

members, Roth, Hitchcock and
Cummings, make no money from the

change.
“I want give
the two other
board mem-
bers something for the time they put

Members of Roboto use the word
“cooperative” so much you start to
wonder if they share toothbrushes.

and is catered to — punks.

C.’

John Fail, a regular show booker
said. ‘

“There have been all kinds of A

different shows there. I’ve been to
pop shows and jazz shows, and I’ve
booked some experimental shows
myself,” Fail said.

There’s even been a puppet
show.

“Anyone who complains about
the types of things that go on there
can just get a membership and start
booking whatever they want to see,”
he added.

Roboto also has a library of
about 600 zines organized into five
subjects: local, political, music, per-
sonal/general interest and regulars
like tMaximum Rock ‘N’ Roll and
Punk Planet. The board members
had heard of other zine libraries in
Florida, Ohio and California, and it
seemed like a good addition to the
show space. ‘t

“A lot of people have said they
like the library because if they don’t
feel like watching a band or there is
time betweenbands, they can read a
zine,” Hitchcock said.

“The shows draw people inter-
ested in independent music and
activist culture synonymous with
many zines. We received some help
from the Civic Media Center in
Gainesville, Fla., and began to orga-

nize Mr. Roboto’s zine library from

that,” Hitchcock said.

Although Roboto is set up to
give members equal stakes, it could
still be easy to fall to the dark side
and limit the kinds of shows put on

there. But that’s not going to happen \

anytime in the near future, according
to the board members. A

They believe, at the core, Roboto
is a group of visionaries who care
more about their ideals than the all-
powerful “scene,” and contrary to
popular belief, cooperatives do
ﬂourish in this all-corporate, pop-
culture world.’

New defensive coordinator Paul Rhoads, a mix of young players plus

returning veterans give the Pitt defense a new look for 2000

Paul Rhoads, Pitl’s new defensive coordinator, talks to his squad during practice on Sunday night.

... the more they stay the same

Junior quarterback David Priestley

Priestley, Turman, Grim, Bryant and
Barlow still leading the Pitt offense

MARIO MACH]
Sports A Editor

Walt Harris came to Pitt in 1996 with

the reputation of being an offensive
genius.‘ He took a step toward proving
that -in 1997 when he led the upstart
Panthers to a 6-5 record and a berth in the
Liberty Bowl. .
A . The next season was a different story.
Quarterback Matt Lytle and the Panthers
never got on track and struggled through-
out a 2-9 season. But Harris and the
Panthers bounced back, leading the Big
East Conference with 240.4 passing yards
per game in 1999. V '

The offense propelled Pitt to a 5-6
ﬁnish. Now, the question surrounding the
2000 Panthers is whether or not the

offense can improve upon last season and

' vault the Panthers into the upper echelon

of the Big East.

“I think we have a chance to be a
good oﬁense this year,” Harris said. “We
just need to execute.”

Here’s a position-by-position look at
the Panthers offense:

Quarterbacks -.
For the ﬁrst time since he ‘came to

Pitt, Harris has the luxury of experience at .

the quarterback position. John Turman
and David Priestley split the duties last
year, and both return in 2000.

Priestley, a junior, missed spring
drills with an injury to his right shoulder,
which occurred when he was tackled in

Paul Rhoads runs down the side-
line, working up a sweat, as the Pitt
defense comes up with a big play at
the new UPMC Sports Performance
Complex during training camp.

— The thing is, Rhoads doesn’t
play football, he coaches it.

Rhoads joined the Panthers in
the off-season as the new defensive
coordinator and secondary coach,
one of five new coaches with the
team this year.

As a secondary coach with the
Iowa State Cyclones for the past four
seasons, Rhoads helped improve the
team’s efficiency rating from 95th to
29th in the country. .

His job will be to oversee a
defense, that six of 11 returning
"starters from last year’s 5-6 team.

and I believe that running, catching
and tackling wins football games,”

KENNE|' H PAUL

 

- Senior Staff Writer

Special teams is one of the most
overlooked components in the game of
football, yet it is extremely vital‘ to any
successful team. _

Pitt’s special teams were a bright
spot throughout the mediocre 1999 sea-

T son. The team led »theBig East in aver-

age net yards per punt (40.5) and yards

ingifourth in ﬁeld goal percentage.
.._'*T he team’s impressive statistics

were a reﬂection of the outstanding sea—.

sons of seniors Hank Poteat and Greg

. DeBolt.

S i:Potea't, who was a punt returner and
cornerback, was named to the All—Big
East ﬁrst teamndefense. He did so while
collecting .a league—leading average of
16 yards per punt return.

DeBolt was voted to the All-Big
East second team defense and was

ranked second in the conference with
an average of 40.8 ‘yards per punt. ’
However, Pitt must move on as
both players have graduated. Poteat is
now with the Pittsburgh Steelers while
DeBolt is vying for a spot with the
Arizona Cardinals. .

teams coach Bob Ligashesky the

In comparing this season’s Pitt
football training camp to that of 1999,
the obvious difference is the location.
Last year, Pittﬂheld camp on the cam-
pus of Pitt—.lohnstown, while this
year’s camp is at the new UPMC
Sports Performance Complex in the
South Side.

But a closer look at camp finds
some more differences.

New coaches adjusting
with no troubles

Rather, it finds some different
people, namely the five new assistant
coaches who have been hired since the
end of the 1999 season.

The new defensive coordinator is ’

Paul Rhoads, who came to Pitt after

five "years as a defensive coach at

Iowa State.

Rhoads replaces Larry Coyer, now
the linebackers coach of the Denver
Broncos.

Kenny Carter is the new running
backs coach, replacing Vincent White.
Carter was the outside linebackers

coach at Louisiana State in 1999. He

left the Tigers -after head coach Gerry
DiNardo was fired, and replaced by
Nick Saban. . .

Carter said that his decision to
come to Pitt was a no—brainer.

“It’s a good situation here,” Carter

said. “I had no doubts" that I would

have a great team to coach.”

Curtis Bray, a former linebacker at
Pitt from 1988-91, returned to his
alma mater in the fall after serving the
past three years as defensive ends
coach at Villanova.

Bray said his adjustment has been
pretty easy, since he grew up in the
Pittsburgh suburb of\Monroe.ville and
knows the area. I

“Pm familiar with Pittsburgh, so
that’s helped a lot,” Bray said. “It’s
been going well so far.”

David Blackwell, Pitt’s new line-
backers coach, engineered a huge
turnaround at Illinois State, where he
was an assistant coach for the past
four seasons.

The linebacker position is one of »

the deepest on the team, and with
seven returning players, Blackwell"s

‘ transition should be easier.

“I have just as much respect for
Coach Blackwell and Coach Rhoads
as I did for Coach Coyer,” Pitt line-
backer Ryan Gonsales said. “Right
now I’m just listening to Coach
Blackwell and
niques.” J ,

The final ._new coach is Bob
Ligashesky, who took over as tight
ends and special teams
Ligashesky is a Pittsburgh native who

-spent the previous nine years at

Bowling Green.

“Its neat being back home,”
Ligashesky said. “I had some good
times at Bowling Green, but I just love
being here in Pittsburgh.”

Cartersaid the new coaches have
worked well together in spring prac-

1 tice and in training camp.

‘“It’s been a very smooth adjust-
ment,” he said’. “I attribute that to

"gcohesiveness.'The cohesiveness is

tremendous on this staff.”

said Rhoads. “But, I understand
there’s a lot more to the game than
that.” _

The defensive side of the ball is
where most of the competition for
starting positions is being fought -for
in.the South Side. '

As many as four players will be
competing for two starting corner-
back positions.

— Six Panthers are fighting for four
spots on the defensive line and seven
returning linebackers are jockeying
for playing time, with only three
available slots in Pitt’s 4-3 defense,

‘ Here is a breakdown of each

defensive position and what to look‘

for as the season begins at home on
Sept. 2 against Kent State:

Defensive End

Four-year letter winners Julian
Graham and Ken Kashubara are not
returning, and Graham’s loss will
hurt the Panthers if they don’t find a

viable replacement.

Graham, now with the Canadian
Football League’s Winnipeg Blue
Bombers, had 49 tackles, including
five-for a loss.

‘Pitt will have redshirt junior

Bryan Knight back, however, at the‘

other end position.

Knight started all 11 games last
year, recording team highs with three
sacks, nine tackles for losses and six
quarterback hurries. He was also
third on the team in tackles with 69.

“Bryan isa quick guy, and .he’s
in great shape,” said Curtis Bray, the
new defensive ends coach and former
Pitt player. ‘_‘We have to play quick,

and he’s the guy that is going to be

leading by example.”
Ryan Smith is the only other
returning defensive end for the

Panthers, recording 24 tackles in‘

parts of nine games in 1999.

V Redshirt senior Nigel Neal, who

played defensive tackle last year,
moved to end in spring practice and
looks as if he is getting better with
the new position. '

Two redshirt freshmen, Claude
Harriott and George Peslis, don’t fig-
ure to get‘ much time at defensive
end, but have impressed Bray. A

“The guys we have up front are
young, but we have a lot of enthusi-
asm and energy,” Knight said. “We

have to be patient and work on our 1

techniques and be mentally sound as

‘ far as our defensive schemes‘ got”

Defensive Tackle

The,Panthers lost another critical a

member of last year’s defense in
Demond Gibson, but there are,
enough bodiesgin camp to replace his

position beside returning senior Mike
_ White atnose tackle, . V , -

» , v . . . . . ; , .

One member of last year’s team
that won’t be seeing time this year is
Brandon Dewey, who will take a red-
shirt for the 2000 season because of
personal and family reasons, accord-
ing to Harris.

Redshirt junior Joe Conlin is
back after two shoulder injuries in
the past year, but seems to be out-
done at times by redshirt freshmen
Penny Semaia and Darrell McMurray
in a bid for the starting job.

~ Both Semaia and McMurray have
shown signs that they can handle the
rigorous duties of trying to get to
opposing quarterbacks snap after
snap.

Linebacker

With eight linebackers returning
this year that have played for Pitt at
some point, the depth chart was not
easy to formulate.

“There’s some good competition

, at linebacker, both in the middle and

at the Sam and
Harris said.

Sam and Will are nicknames for
strong and weak side linebackers,
respectively.

In the middle,
Gonsales seems to be the only defi-
nite starter.

Gonsales ‘made 67 tackles in
eight games in 1999 after missing
three games with a knee injury. He
was also credited with 1.5 sacks and
led the ‘Panthers with two "fumble
recoveries.

“It makes it a little harder with
the new coaches to stand out,” said
Gonsales. “But, you just have to lis-
tento what they say and keep on
moving through campff

Backing Gonsales up will be red-
shirt sophomore Scott McCurley,
who came up big in Pitt’s 37-27 win
over Notre Dame in the last gamevat

Will positions,”

Pitt Stadium;

McCurley intercepted a pass and

blocked a field -goalto help preserve

the ‘ victory.

Harris and the Panthers rewarded
McCurley with a full scholarship this
year after two as a walk—on.

Junior Amir Purifoy, redshirt '
junior Nick Cole, redshirt sophomore 1

Brian Beinecke, redshirt senior Kody
Miller, and sophomore Gerald Hayes
are all in the hunt for the two outside
linebacker positions, with Purifoy
probably getting one of them.

The strong side was vacated by 1 :14

Karim'Thompson’s departure.
Whoever starts, barring injuries,

Pitt "should have a number of fresh

legs to rotate into the three positions.

Cornerback

Rhoads wants to first educate
defensive backs on the deep pass, an
area that cost the Panthers a game
last yearqagainst Boston College.

OFFENSE

the Nov. 6 game against  He had
surgery in the off-season, but did not
resume throwing until the middle of the
summer.

“The shoulder is ﬁne,” Priestley said.
“I just started a little rusty, and I’m a little
behind, but it feels good.”

The injury was the first serious injury
Priestley had sustained since his junior
year in high school, when he also suffered
a shoulder injury.

“That one wasn’t nearly as ba ,”
Priestley said of the high school injury. “I
was only out eight weeks with that.”

Turman, meanwhile, had what Harris
termed a “productive” spring and has
started off well in camp. Turman is a
senior, and he was asked if only having
one year of eligibility left would hurt his
chance to be the starter. -

“I hope not,” Turman said, smirking
at the possibility. “I really hope that does-
n’t play a part in the decision-making
process.”

Turman started seven games last
year, includingthe ﬁnale of Pitt Stadium,
when he led Pitt to a 37-27 victory over
Notre Dame. Despite garnering most
valuable player honors for his perfor-
mance in Pitt’s 20-17 loss to Penn State,
Turman claimed that game to be one
which he wished he could play again.

“I just wish the score would have
been a little different,” Turman said.

The other quarterbacks in camp are

FROM PAGE 60

redshirt freshman Rod Rutherford and
true freshman Pat Hodemy.

Rutherford, from Pittsburgh’s Perry
Traditional Academy, was one of the
most highly-touted recruits in Pitt’s histo-
ry, and went through a learning process as
a freshman last year. The redshirt year
was worth it, according to some of
Rutherford’s players and coaches.

“Rod is taking it all in stride,” said
Turman, Rutherford’s fellow quarterback
and roommate for camp. “Some people
would have been upset about not playing
last year, but Rod is mature enough to get
past that. Once people start to see his
skills, they won’t question him anymore.”

Harris agrees that Rutherford has
come a long way since his high school
days. ‘

“I’m really proud of the work Rod
has done,” Harris said.

Hodemy is a candidate for a redshirt,
and he is going through the trials and
tribulations that are typical for a player
trying to learn Harris’ complicated West
Coast offense.

“I’m picking [the offense] up a little
bit at a time,” Hodemy said.

Running backs

Kevan Barlow and Nick Goings’
combined total of 1,099 yards in 1999 is
the ninth highest total for a returning duo
of running backsin the nation.

Barlow has been praised by the
coaching staff for his work ethic and is
often cited as one of the team leaders.

“Kevan committed himself in the off-
season,” said Kenny Carter, Pitt’s new

running backs coach. “He’s motivating,

everyone else with his performance.”

Barlow himself discounts the praise
but then gloriﬁes the coaching staff, cred-.
iting them with his successes in 1999 and
again this spring.

“The coaches have been great to me,
the senior tailback said.

As for Carter, Barlow wastes no time
letting his feelings be known on his new
coach. ,

“I love him. I absolutely love him,”
Barlow said. “His hiring has turned. out to
be a blessing in disguise.”

Carter is different from last year’s
running backs coach Vincent White,
because according to Barlow, “he’s a
player’s‘coach.”

Injuries have been a concern through-
out Barlow’s career, and he knows it
could make or break not only his season,
but the possibility of a pro career.

“IfI can stay healthy, I’ll be okay,”
Barlow said. ’

Backing up Barlow will be Torrie
Cox and Goings. Goings, a senior, rushed
for six touchdowns last season and is
more of a bruising tailback, while Cox is
a speedy back. Carter likes what‘ both
players bring to the table.

99
.

“Nick and Torrie, they are stepping it »

up,” Carter said. “We want to have fresh
legs to be able to punish people, and with

those guys running the ball, that is possi-

ble.” .
Also in the mix at tailback will be
Darcey Levy, a transfer from Front Range

Community College in Colorado, who -
played his ﬁrst two seasons at Notre ‘

Dame. Levy is not eligible until the fifth
game under NCAA rules, but according

' to Carter, he will be used.

“Darcey is the fastest player we have
on our team,” Carter said. “It’s going to
be hard to keep him out of the lineup.”

Usually an afterthought in the Pitt
offense, the fullbacks could play a key
role this year. Returning are Mark
Moothart and Rickey Mendenhall, along
with Lousaka Polite, who redshirted last
season. .

Joining the veterans in camp is
Dustin Picciotti, a freshman from
Chalfont, Pa., who was named

Pennsylvania Player of the Year by the

Associated Press. Picciotti’s presence is
one of the intriguing factors in camp. The
6-foot-3-inch, 245-pound freshman was
considered the top fullback in the country
by most recruiting experts last season.
Carter was very pleased with the per-
forrnance of the fullbacks early in camp,
but he doesn’t know who will get the nod
when the season starts on Sept. 2 against
Kent State. F «
“We’re going to play the guys who
are ready to get it done,” Carter said. “It’s

‘ as simple as that.”

“There’s no question that the
coaching staff has some worries about
the inexperience at punter,” Ligashesky
said. “There’s no way you can simulate
what a freshman experiences in his first
game.”

Lee, who was a first team all—state
punter in high school, averaged 42.8
yards per punt as a senior. He seems to
be the front—runner for the position at
this point.

Returning at place kicker is junior
Nick Lotz. Last season, Lotz handled
the kickoff duties and will do the same
this year. He led the team in the scoring
department last year, racking up 69
points. Lotz connected on 13 of 17 ﬁeld
goal attempts, and a season-high 44-
yard kick.

“He is getting his timing down and
his accuracy has been good,” said
Ligashesky of Lotz’s performance.

Optimism is defined by
Webster’s New World College
Dictionary as “the tendency to take
the most hopeful or cheerful View
of matters or to expect the best out-
come.”

For football fans, that translates
into thinking that your team will
win the national championship.
Every year at this time, teams go to
preseason camp, and as a result,
every college from Arkansas State
to Temple thinks that it can win its
conference, if not the national

championship. Here at Pitt, it’s no
different.

You’d think that a team with
seven wins in the last two years

t your hopes up  or should you?

sive line look after graduating two
starters? Can the defense adapt to a
new coordinator?

Even though those questions are
there, this year’s Pitt squad seems
ready to move to the next level. You
see, in college football, to win, you
have to have T&A. I know what
you’re thinking, but no, that’s not
right, and I can’t believe you
thought I’d say that. .

The T&A that I’m speaking of is
talent and attitude, which are essen-
tial to every winning program.
That’s no different at Pitt.

John Turman and David
Priestley combined to lead the Big
East Conference in passing yards’
per game in 1999.

The key word there is com-
bined. Neither was consistent
enough to be a starter for the whole
season, although Priestley appeared
to be on his way before a shoulder
injury sidelined him for the last few
games. ' . ‘
However, both players have
come to camp this year with the vet-
eran attitude that should come after
a year of experience at the Division
I level. ‘

That should be encouraging to
Pitt fans who have seen head coach
Walt Harris go through Pete
Gonzalez, Matt Lytle, _Matt
O’Connor, Turman and Priestley as
starting quarterbacks in a four—year
tenure. _ ' g

No one can complain about the
wide receivers, either. Latef Grim is
being hyped as a candidate for the
Fred Biletnikoff Award, which goes
to the nation’s top receiver.

That’s not enough. Grim is as
good, if not better than, Miami’s
Santana Moss, who is being men-
tioned as a possible candidate for
the Heisman Trophy. .

With Grim and last year-’s fresh-
man sensation, Antonio Bryant, Pitt
could give’ most of the schools in
the nation a run for their money
when it comes to receiving corps.

' There is no question that the
Panthers have the talent to win
more games than they will lose.”But
it takes more than talent to win. It
takes a combination of, as I. said
earlier, talent and attitude. .

The talent is there. What about
the attitude? As I mentioned earlier,
the quarterbacks seem to have the
right state of mind. _

If they can be leaders for the
rest of the squad, then Pitt will have
the T&A to match that of the
nation’s » top. college - football teams.

Mario Machi is the sports editor of
The Pitt News, and he has always
been in favor of this newspaper

DEFENSE

“We structure our drills so that
each player shouldn’t be giving up
the deep bal1,” said Rhoads. “You can
play well 68 out of 70 downs in a
game, but if you’re a defensive back
and you give up long bombs on those
other two plays, you’re the jet .”

One starter from a year ago, Hank
Poteat, was drafted in the third round
by the NFL’s Pittsburgh Steelers.

The other, Demetrious Rich, was
dismissed from the team in the off-
season and has since left school and
transferred to Youngstown State.

Of the four players competing for
the two vacated spots, only Robb
Butler, a sophomore, has had experi-

FROM PAGE 68

ence in a Division I defensive back-
field. -

Two other sophomores, Taron
Gray and Shawn Robinson, are both
converted offensive players, while
freshman William “Tutu” Ferguson
rejoins the team after being academi-
cally ineligible last year.

Ferguson was the star of the
annual Blue—Gold game in the spring
with two interceptions.

Along with Robinson and Butler,
Ferguson has made a habit of picking
off passes during training camp, and
whoever is named a starter will be
able to make plays.

“They have to- step up and show
they want to start and I think they’ve
all done that at one time or another,”
said Rhoads. “It’s a healthy competi-
tion and a close one.”

Safety

Redshirt sophomore Ramon
Walker’s preseason honors go on for
half of a column in the Pitt media
guide. .

The accolades range from All—Big
East to being the fifth best free safety
in the nation by The Sporting News.

The most highly—decorated fresh-
man defender in Pitt’s history, Walker
had 131 tackles last year in his rook-
ie campaign, 84 of which were solo
hits.

He also had one interception, one
fumble recovery, and five tackles for
a loss. T

In nine of the 11' games, Walker
registered 10 or more tackles, with a
season-high 16 against Miami. ‘

Redshirt junior and former walk-
on Mark Ponko also returns to start at

Sophomores Gary Urschler and
David Routt have been playing‘ sec-
ond team during camp, and if con-
verted running back Brandon
Williams plays linebacker, as it
appears he will, that might be all the
Panthers have‘.

Health is a large concern in the
defensive backfield, according to
Harris, because of the lack of experi-
ence in the second and third teams.

‘‘In one word, our defense is
going to be enthusiastic,” said
Knight. “We want to play hard and go
out and tackle, we love tackling.”

SPREAD

Michigan are poised for breakout sea-

. sons. Tomlinson is the nation’s leading

returning rusher. I also like Deuce
McAllister of Mississippi and UCLA’s
DeShaun Foster, but neither will top
Thomas, who is my top pick at running
back.

Santana Moss of Miami, David '
' Terrell of Michigan, and Kareem Kelly

of Southern California look to be the
top three wide receivers and it’s any-
body’s guess to who will put up the
biggest numbers. I’ll go with Kelly
because he has Palmer throwing him
the ball. My dark horse is Pitt’s own
Latef Grim. The top wide receiver will
not win the Heisman, but Grim is as
good as any of those three guys.

There’s no one on the defensive
side of the ball that will challenge Vick
or Brees for the stiff-armed trophy, so
Vick is my choice.

National Championship
It would be easy to pick Nebraska
or Florida Stateto be crowned No. 1 at

A the season’s end. Too easy, in fact.

‘\

Nebraska must play at Kansas State
on Nov. 11, and the Seminoles have a
game at Miami on Oct. 7, as well as
two home games against Clemson and
Florida.

I believe it is a Steely Dan ‘song
that says, “They call Alabama the
Crimson Tide.” That’s my pick. After
the opening game at UCLA on Sep. 2,

only Tennessee and Louisiana State,

seem to be in ‘Bama’s way of an unde-
feated season, and... neither team is
strong enough.

_The only concern for the Tide is at -

quarterback, ' but Andrew Zow and

_'I‘yler Watts will do the ,job.

Brad Cuprik is the assistant sports edi- '

tor of The Pitt News and “Spread ‘Em ”
was his idea, so e-mail him at bjcst3I if
you-have any complaints.

FROM PAGE 70

_ Grim and last year’s freshman sensation,

Antonio Bryant, the wide receiving corps

. will make it easier for whomever is cho-

sen to start at quarterback.

Grim is on pace to set the Big East
record in receptions and receiving yards.
He is the nation’s second—leading retum-
ing receiver, after averaging 100.6 receiv-
ing yards per game last season. Grim said
he doesn’t pay attention to any of the
hype surrounding him or the team.

“It doesn’t matter to me,” the senior
said. “I only have one goal, and that is to
win games.”

Grim might not play in Pitt’s season
opener against Kent State on Sept. 2
because of a sprained ankle that he suf-

-fered in Saturday’s intrasquad scrimmage

at Three Rivers Stadium. X—rays on the
ankle were negative, and he is expected to
be evaluated next week to determine
whether or not he will play in the opener.

Bryant, meanwhile, has been one of
the brightest stars in training camp.

. Catching nearly every ball thrown his

way, Bryant has shownsigns that he will
skip the sophomore slump that some
players are known for. Bryant agrees with
Grim that the awards the duo has received
in the preseason don’t mean anything.

“We just have to do what we’re
taught to do — win,” Bryant said-

‘Bryant’s strong camp hasn’t gone
urmoticed by Harris.

“Antonio is an outstanding football
player and he just loves the game,” Harris
said. “Last year, the quarterbacks made
some adjustments and as a result, he was
rewarded.” _

Harris said that Bryant is an unsung

hero for the other things he does besides

catching the ball.

“Some of our tapes showed how he’s
blocking for his teammates whenever he
isn’t catching the ball,” Harris said.
“They have a higher appreciation for him
now.”

The other receivers vying for playing
time are sophomore Lamar Slade, junior
R.J. English and freshman Donny
Patrick. . 

Slade had a productive freshman sea-
son, catching seven passes for 73 yards,
while playing in nine games. English, on
the other hand, played sporadically in the

- 1999 season after suﬁering a knee injury ,
in the off—season, which forced him to

have surgery. He caught 12 passes for 137
yards in 1998 before the injury.
“R.J. has done a great job,” said

-Brookhart, who doubles as the wide’

receivers coach. “He’s made great strides

_. since last year.” »

, Patrick was the Panthers’ only fresh-
man receiver brought in on scholarship,
and he has shown why he deserved that

A _ distinction. He has played well thus far in

camp, learning the offense very quickly
for a freshman.

“Donny’s doing well,” Brookhart
said. “He’s picked up a lot of the offense
in three days, which I attribute to the
offense he was in during his high school
career. He played in a col1ege—style
offense in high school, so he’s ahead of
some of the others here.”

Tight Ends

One spot up for grabs is the starting
tight end position, which was vacated
upon the graduation of Kirk McMullen
and Ben Kopp. Competing for the job are

Mike Bosnic, Kris Wilson, Brennan"

Carroll and Matt Mefford.

- Bosnic suffered a minor injury early
in camp which forced him to miss a few
days, opening the door for the others to
practice with the first team. Bosnic was
one of the major surprises in spring drills,
and was one of the recipients of the Ed
Conway Award, which goes to the most
improved players following spring prac-
tice. I
Wﬂson redshirted as a true freshman
last year, but has good quickness and
footwork and is a good receiver at the
tight end slot.

Carroll, a junior, is also a good
receiver. He improved his blocking skills
in the spring in an attempt to. move up the
depth chart at tight end.

Mefford is a redshirt freshman who
came to Pitt as an offensive lineman. He
moved to tight end in spring drills
because of a shortage of players after the
graduation of Kopp and McMullen. He is
a pure blocker who should contribute to
the 2000 Panthers.

Offensive Line

VV1th the graduation of tackles Ethan
Weidle and Ryan Hansen, Pitt has two
huge voids in the offensive _line. How
huge? Try 6—foot-6-inches, 300 pounds
and 6—foot—7—inch, 295 _, pounds, respec-
tively. 9

Tentatively, Mark Browne and
Khiawatha Downey will fill the holes.
Browne started for Pitt in 1998 but
missed the "1999 season with a shoulder
injury. Downey played left guard last sea-
son but has been moved to right tackle for
the 2000 campaign.

Jeff McCurley is returning as the
starting center, and he is one of the play-
ers who is very happy about the new tack-
les.

“I’m glad we have some guys with
experience playing there,” McCurley
said. “Mark Browne and Khi Downey are
looking very good.” 0

The right guard will be sophomore
Bryan Anderson, who had a strong fresh-
man season in 1999. His partner on the
left side has yet to be decided, although
the job is up for grabs among the trio of
Jon Schall, Joe Manganello and Nick
Pietracatello.

VV1th the revamped offensive line, a
strong running game and "excellent
receivers, the choice for starting quarter-

back will have a lot of weapons to choose -

from as he tries to give Pitt its ﬁrst -win-
ning record and bowl berth since 1997.

PREVIEW

The Panthers will need a big season
from junior co—captain Cande Ruiz, who,
like Gellatly, was a member of the Big-
East all—rookie team in her first season.
She had 26 points, 56 shots and five
game-winning goals in that 1998 cam-
paign.

Last season though, Ruiz, continual-
ly hampered with injuries, was only able
to muster a goal and two assists, regis-
tering l3 shots.

Other important returners are junior
midﬁelder Katrina Shibata, sophomore
defender Jacqueline Fix and junior
defenseman Keeley Tobler. Tobler is the
only returning Panther that started every
game last season.

back from a 5—12—1 season in which they
finished seventh in the Big East’s Mid-
Atlantic division.

The team last season had made its
preseason goal to play in the postseason,
but were not able to convert ‘on their in-

conference opportunities. The Panthers

ﬁnished 1-4-1 in the Big East last year.

The Panthers opened up last season
defeating Duquesne 1-0. They were beat
by Navy at their first home game, but
came back to defeat the University of
Pennsylvania in the opening match of
the University of Maryland ‘Fila
Invitational. 4

After achieving this modest success,
the Panthers were unable to win on a six-
game road trip that took them through

the matches at home, going 3-5-1 during
that stretch.
In probably the best match of the

season, the Panthers ‘counted; on Gellatly I

for some offensive power against Old
Dominion Oct. 17, 1999..

Having scored more than one goal
only once in the season, in a 5-4 over-‘

time loss to Rutgers, Gellatly was able to
put two in the Lady Monarchs’ net, lift-
ing the Panthers to a 3-0 rout. ,

Pitt lost its final three games, includ-
ing a 2-0 loss to Miami on Pitt’s senior
night, when the team gave a farewell to
its inaugural members and its home sta-
dium. '

In. the last game the Panthers lost to
Penn State, 7-1.

Pitt will play several new teams in
this season’s schedule, including road

trips to Arizona and Arizona State. In.

their own conference, the Panthers will
have to ‘play big starting at the end of
September. They will play five Big East

Mid—Atlantic division games in a row, L

then they take on Boston College at

home and then go to Georgetown to end .

their conference season.

The Panthers are led by head coach
Roland Sturk, who is in his fifth season.
Sturk has compiled a record of 19-51-4
in his first four years at Pitt.
