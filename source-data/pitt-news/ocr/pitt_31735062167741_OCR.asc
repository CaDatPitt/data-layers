8.6 Million

University Borrows $$ Pugh

by ELEANOR ADAMETS
Staff Writer

By the end of November the
University will have borrowed
$5.5 million due to the failure of’
the State Legislature to appro-
priate promised funds. An addi-

tional $3.1 million is expected to

be borrowed next month to meet
operating expenses.

Vice Chancellor of Finance,
Edison Montgomery, voiced opti-
mism that the Legislature will
enact new taxation legislation be-
fore the end of the year. Such

 action would make unnecessary

plans to borrow more money in
1970.

operating expenses, including sal-
aries, could not be deferred.

If the appropriation should
prove to be insufficient, the Uni-
versity will not beable to make
the purchases and improvements
it has thus far deferred.

State scholarship recipients.
may also be affected if sufficient
funds are not available. However,
in an attempt to assure worried
students, the Legislature did pass
a Joint Resolution committing
approval of scholarship funds. ’

Vice-Chancellor Montgomery

suggested that concerned stu-
dents write to their legislators
to inform them of the tax program
they favor. The letters should
not demand an immediate appro-
priation to the University, but
should focus on the real problem.

"This unfortunate situation is

"basically a taxation issue,” Mont-

gomery said. "Governor Shafer’s
personal income tax program must
either be supported or totally re-
jected in favor of another program
before we can expect to receive
our funds.”

Udall Concerned lWith

Staff Writer

One hundred people were
present in the SU Ballroom
Wednesday at noon to hear a
talk given by Stewart Udall,
former Secretary of the Interior
under the Johnson and Kennedy
administrations. Udall, now a visit-
ing professor at Yale, has writ-
ten two books, The Quiet Crisis,
and 1967, Agenda for Tomorrow,
dealing with environment and
conservation.

The University has been placed

in its present “financial squeeze” Udall described by his own

and compelled to borrow money
from local banks because the
State Legislature failed to appro-
priate funds that the University
should have collected July 1st,
the beginning of the fiscal year.
This lack of action by the
Legislature is the result of a
hassel over the method to secure
revenue from the public.

“Unlike the situation in Cal-

» ifornia, no one in. Harrisburg is}

angry at the University. The"
funds simply can’t be appropriat-
ed until the Legislature decides
how to get the money from the
public,” Vice Chancellor Mont-
gomery explained.

Until the tax» bill is passed,
neither the Legislature nor the
University will know exactly
how much money is available.
There is a possibility that theref
may not be sufficient funds to meet
all the University’s expenses.

In anticipation of such an event,
however unlikely at this point,
the University has deferred any
expenses that were possible to
postpone. Purchases of new equi-
pment, physical repairs, and gen-
eral improvements have been avoid-
ed where possible. As the Vice
Chancellor pointed out, general

"We have met the enemy and
they are us,” stated Dr. Morgan
Southworth in the opening re-
marks of “Death at an Early
Age.’f .

“Death At An Early Age” was
a discussion among over 100 stu-
dents and faculty about the Ele-
mentary Education program, held
Wednesday in the SU supper
room.

Dr. Southworth, Chairman of the
Faculty of Elementary Education
Programs, started the dicussion
off with the statement “We are
concerned not with improving the
Elementary Educational program,
but changing it radically.”

“So far,” he said “we have ex-
amined the curriculum, and found
that all but three hours of courses
out of 131 hours were required by
somedoby. When found that some-
body was us, we set aside all
but those courses which the
Commonwealth has mandated. Now
we need help in individualizing‘
the entire program.”

William Cole. a faculty mem-
ber stated the reason for involv-
ing students. “How do we know
what we don’t have if we don’t.
ask the students?” he queried.

But Cole went on to say that the
student “will have to first con-
sider if he really wants to be in
El. Ed.. and secondly. consider
what he wants from the depart-
ment. and if the department can
give it to him."

Director of Interns. Chuck Gore-
man. related Curriculum changes
to the school system. “The changes
won’t be significant unless changes
in the school system are made.
These changes will require new
kinds of public school systems.“
stated Goreman.

Nick DeFigio. Chairman of the
Undergraduate Curriculum Com-
mittee summed up the purpose of
the discussion as a move to "let
everybody know that we are look-
ing for help.“

"We are ready. we want to move.
we need help. and we are will-
ing to accept it from anybody.“ he
stated.

In Common Facilities

250 Gatherln Peace 0

Approximately 250 University
people gathered last night in the
Common Facilities Building to
celebrate their lives through
peace and classes. movies. and in-
formal seminars.

The feature film. Titicut Fol-
lies, drew about 60 or 70 viewers.
Informal discussions varied in
size and topics. with many people
just sitting around talking to other
people.

"The Kid Who Owes You $40"
offered live entertainment from
11 p.m. to 1 a.m. when most peo-
ple started to drift home.

Although many of the partici-
pants in last night’s gathering
were veterans of last year’s fast
in the same building, there were
no political overtones to the gath-
ering. The building had been pro-
cured for the whole night from the
University. ‘

In addition to Titicut Follies,
which depicts the life of a member
of a mental institution as a very
remorseful situation. short films
were shown from the 1920's. as

was a film on the French student
revolt.

Oranges and apples supplied the
bulk of the refreshments. as well
as the major source of entertain-
ment for those who were skilled
in juggling. throwing. or catching.

When asked about the gathering.
most students agreed with the say-
ing on the handouts announcing

ity’s turn to shout.

hits at was the population ex-
plosion. According to him. ‘The
family planning movement is now

' coming together with the conser-

vationists. Not only are the con-
servationists worried. but environ-
mentalists and ecologists fear that
unless people level off the pop-
ulation. our resources will con-
tinue to wear away at a greater
rate than in the past.

He said that most government
officials and interest groups have
been saying that our population
will double within the next
fifty years. and that we should
build more roads. airports and
other utilities now to compensate
for this future boom.

Udall takes the opposing view,
and says that we should work to
cut down the rate of population
expansion, “rather than letting

, it run rampant and hope to build

now for a future crisis.” He look-
ed optimistically at the recent
figures on the birth rate. “A de-
cade ago the. birthrate in this
country was 24/1000. This year
and last year, the birthrate was
17/1000. If it went down to 14/

l000,” the former cabinet. mem- ..

ber explained, “we would have a
levelling off of the population.”

One bone of contention with
Udall was the “fact that we are
sloughing off millions and mil-
lions of tons of waste each year.
and could conceivably bury our-
selves in our own garbage. Waste.
is inefficiency. and with all of our
advanced technology. we should
be able to utilize the things that
are destroying our resources."
He prophesized that five hundred
years from now. our generation
will probably be known as “the
dumpers."

Udall concluded. stating that.
"the time has come when we must
realize the sources of life support
on our planet. If we were to
select the environment as a nation-
al task. we might go from a ma-
chine age to a humane age. We
should not only be aware of the
importance of the environment to
man." he said. “but we should
make city building a great enter-
prise for the country. building
a balanced. well ordered. livable.
city system."

I spent the bulk of a free Fri-

ll day night at my uncle’s house

last week. It was one of those
family reunion affairs that you
put up with twice a year for

6 your parents’ sake.

My uncle is a nice man. He

K has five childrenvand a home in

the suburbs. He also beats his
wife, but that's a family scandal
and we don’t talk about it: es-

 i-pecially not in front of him.

As I was removing my authen-

tic peacoat (surplus). his glance,

took in the Moratorium button
on its lapel. “Is that a joke or
are you a goddam peacenik.” he

 j asked.  

I told him that I was a god-
dam peacenik.

“You’re always talking about
social justice,” He started in on
me. “Well, don’t you think a big,
rich country like the United
States should help a poor. little
country like South Vietnam de-

fend itself against Communism. ‘

especially when we were asked
to go in?”

I thought I’d begin ration-

ii  ally, and hit him with a little

history. I began explaining the
oppression of the then Indochin-
ese by the French, paralleling it
to the position of the USA there.

I brought in the puppet re-
gime of Diem, the fraudulent
elections of the past few years
and the consistent attempt of
the US government to spread its
conception of "democracy"
throughout the world. An attempt
made via coercion and political
maneuvers, a la Latin America.

“How do you know what hap-
pens over there?” He was be-
coming agitated, spilling his gin
and tonic on the rug. "You never

talk to anyone who's been in

Vietnam. Those Vietcong are
animals; they rape, torture and
massacre. All you know about
is books.”

The discussion was becom-
ing irrelevant to the issue. I
thought. It seemed ‘absurd to me
to try to convince him that, yes.
I had talked to many, many vet-
erans of the war and that many
of them were actively involved
inorganizing the Moratorium.

It seemed absurd to insist that .

I could possibly know something

 Push “Social Justice’

 

of what "is going on over there."
But I attempted to communicate
my feelings about the fabric of
the war in Vietnam - its immor-
ality. I

The corner that I was holed
up - in was beginning to at-
tract the attention of others at
the reunion. My cousin_ asked me
if I wanted a blindfold before
the execution.

"The problem is not how we
got there or why we're there."
continued my uncle. "The simple
thing is that we are there. The
problem is how to get out. If
we pull out. the Communists
will massacre the people. The
Vietcong are crossing the DMZ
now. The Americans never do
and they're paying for it. Why
don’t you listen to the news and
read the papers."

I challenged why he thought
that the Americans were so
guiltless. A local news station
had recently carried a story con-
cerning a film smuggled out of
Vietnam. The film depicted
South Vietnamese soldiers and
two American Gls disembowling
a wounded Vietcong.

"Well. I don't believe it." he
countered. "You can’t believe
everything you hear.“

I wondered how he could be-
lieve everything he has heard
about the Vietcong.

"We've got to believe what
the President says.‘ We elected
him." he said. “Who elected
him". I said. I was getting angry.
"Who elected him. not me. I

can't even vote. Anyway. Nixon’

has been saying the same thing
for the last sixteem years.“

“You're not an American. he
shouted. The rest of his drink
landed on the floor. "Whatever.
this country does. you criticize.
You're going to wake up some
day. You have no respect for
anything - not the president.
not your parents. not even re-
ligion. I don't know what this
country is coming to."

There wasn‘t anything else
to say. But he wanted to be my
friend. He put his arm around
my shoulders and offered me ’a
drink.

"No thanks." I said. "I'm not
21 yet."

Higher education is a game
of Monopoly. The players can
be divided into two categories:
students. who are represented
by a small token in the shape
of a sheep; and the adminis-

larger tokens in the shape of
wolves.

Unfortunately few students
realize that it is a game we
play. This is so because. al-
though students are expected to
play the game: students are

The Monopoly Game

game play. This is indeed un-
fair. for our opponents have
begun to cheat.

Not only have they neglect-
ed to tell us that we get $200
for passing ‘GO." but they have
also stacked the Community
Chest cards against us.

I have pilfered a box top. and
after some careful scrutiny. I
would like to share with you
some of the tactics that our op-
position uses to put student
players at a great disadvantage.

The first item that demands
attention is the odd way in
which the administration plays
with money. I'm sure you have
noticed that to play the game we
are required to part with $710
on every pass.

That money is immediately
put into the coffers of our toes,
and we lose control of it. With
our money these same foes build
hotels on Park Place and yet
still charge us rent on each pass
around the board.

Secondly. our rivals have been
sly in attempting to distract us.
They have hired a faculty to
kibitz. The faculty. well heeled
with our pink, green and blue
monies. tells us that the key to
winning the game is not so much

knowledge of the rules, but
rather skill in handling the
dice. A

0‘ Thus. some teach us of the

history of dice rolls; some preach
about the economic impact of
dice rolls; others attempt to pre-
dict future dice rolls. Still
other faculty contend that we
must know things about dice
themselves.

Consequently, we study. all
in a sincere attempt to win the
game, the chemistry of dice
cubes, engineering of the die.
etc. Recently, with computer-
aided research, scientists hope
to answer the now paramount
question of how many dice can
fit on the head of an angel. None-
theless, as we pontificate on

the nature and essence of the
dice. our rivals build hotels on
Boardwalk.

Finally. when we get wise
and attempt to build housing
complexes. we are constantly
frustrated. Consistently our op-

ponents snatch away our little 

houses or even an occasional
hotel because we have acquired
no “titles“ or “deeds“ to the
properties.

In their effort to monopolize’
the game. our opponents have
appealed to a dirty old. man
named Trusty. As of this mo-
ment Trusty has said nothing
but "Students have no deeds.

they cannot build, they can only

pay rent." Under the circum-
stances this codger is not to be
trusted.

(

What can we do? In the
first case. let us simply realize
that the $710 is; after all. stu-
dent money and should be con-
trolled by students. We need no
benefactors to oversee it for us.
If our antagonists want some
they will ask and justify to the
hilt their request. At the same
time we will negotiate a proper
rate of interest.

In the second case. we should
take the collective wisdom of
the faculty on the matter of dice,
and feed it to the canary for din-

x

ner.

Finally we must acquire the
titles to properties and concerns
that are legitimately ours. And
we shall be protected by regis-
tering the deed with the maker
of the game, Parker Bros. of
Harrisburg.

However, a word of warning. . .
We must be very careful in re-
vising our game plan given the
above analysis. Although we have
gotten some insights into a win-
ning game strategy. overt action
will be countered with a Com-
munity Chest card saying: “Go
directly to Jail.” This could
weaken our chances of ever win-
ning the monopoly game’ of high-
er education.

Attack On Pittsburgh?

Special to The Pitt News

 

While attending the national Moratorium in
Washington last week. I had the opportunity to

meet a group of people who are definitely the -

last word in the new—born radical movement.

Calling themselves. The Rhinos. these peo-
« ple claim to be the militant faction of the pseu-

do-militant "Weathermen". although their ac-
tions are completely apolitical in motivation.
They state that the "Weathermen" are "a bunch
of sissy girls performing their Halloween stunts
before the camera.“

I met the leader of The Rhinos early Satur-
day in the Georgetown area of Washington. He
seemed slightly drunk. and this. in all probabil-
ity; accounted for his willingness to talk about
the group.

Refusing to give his name. and only asserting’

he was the mayor of Buffalo and Rhino Minister

‘of Destruction. he spoke briefly about the origin

and goals of the group.

“The Rhinos are a collection of society mis-
fits who cannot accept the socialization impris-
onment of any society. We believe in only one
fundamental law. and that is nature's law of sur-
vival of the fittest. We know we are more fit to
live than anyone else. and we will kill to prove
it. If we get killed in the process. then that‘s also
alright. We will respect that law: we will die if
we are not the better killers.

"We decided to organize the group in Buf-
falo. after six of us just drifted together. We all
loved the wild part of this planet. and loved the
semmingly endless process of life and death.
We now want to carry this process into America
in a purer form than pollution or cancer. We
will bring pure non-directed mayhem to the
streets. . i

"It can be a cop. an old lady. even one of
us. It doesn't matter. After all. to the Rhino.

killing is the purest of all physical pleasures.”

I asked the Minister of Destruction how the
group decided upon the name, Rhono.

“It ‘came about one night in Buffalo. We
were raising some hell, and this cop tried to
stop us. I just lowered my head and charged him.
I hit him
cold. The next morning, I read in the paper that
a policeman was assaulted by someone« who
charged him like a crazed rhonocerous. That's

how it started."

Anticipating my next question, he went on
to explain why they did not cause any trouble in
Washington.

“We don’t want to be confused with the
Weathermen in any way. They're a bunch of
punk kids. Stick’ real revolution in their face
and they’d crap in their pants. We don’t dig
them. man. They’ll be hearing from us."

After saying that. he pulled out what looked
like a .38 magnum and held it- in front of my
face.

"This ain’t no brick man. This will Chang
some minds." c

He then asked me where I was from. and
when I said Pittsburgh his face lit up. He said
that that is where they intend to base their
operation and where they will start their terror-
ist chaos. He then pulled out a chain and swung
at me. catching me on the cheek. and opening
a deep gash. I ran with my recorder. only to
hear him screaming that “We'll be in Pittsburgh
and get you. you bastard." -

Being a well-known member of the university
community. I am not using my real name. for
fear of identification. But I wanted to let this
community and the general Pittsburgh commun-
ity know what is coming. in hopes that any ser-
ious trouble may somehow be averted. '

Scratch Work

Editor, Pitt News,

I was at Washington on Novem-
ber 15 but the whole extravagant
lot of phonies and “heads” left
me wondering what kind of car-
nival was planed for Saturday.
Dave Tiernan talked of a beau-
tiful feeling while enroute to
and at Washington. Where did he
think he was going, another Wood-
stock? I believed Washington had
a purpose far above the "warm
community feeling” of standing
around shivering in a tent along
the Potomac. I shivered. but I
wasn’t concerned with finding
my friends and philosophizing
about an idealistic way to bring
peace. The whole affair sounded
like the Henry Wallace campaign
of 1948. The picture of the Wash-
ington Monument was very ef-
fective in dramitizing the "beau-

. tiful" time missed by anone who

couldn’t make the trip. I feel the
whole point of the Moratorium
was lost in the attitude of most
of those who made the pilgra-
mige. The whole point of the
moratorium seemed to be "mar-
tyrize oneself,” "we came. we
saw. we conquered Washington."

The mass rally was impressive
in sheer number only. The whole

thing was little more than a huge
platform for someone with power
to sound-off. Dick Gregory sound-
ed more like he was warming up
a television audience. Why didn't
he say something constructive?
The rhetoric was aimed directly
at charging an already emotional
audience. This could be the rea-
son Tiernan’s article of Nov-
ember 17 bursts with "brother-
hood and warm feelings." It
wasn't worth the uncomfortable
cold to see what anyone else
would say. Maybe I missed the
whole point of the March by
being serious about it.

We, the following studentsof

-the University. feel that The Pitt

News is an integral part of the
University. We therefore have a
suggestion to improve the Pitt

We thing the usefulness ofthe

format is introduced. We feel
the News can better serve the Stu-
dents if they would print on only
one side of the paper. That way.
we can use the other side of the
paper for scratch work. This way.
The Pitt News wouldn't be com-
pletely useless.

Udall Expatiates On Conservation

by MICHAEL EDELSTEIN
Staff Writer

Former Secretary of the In-
terior Stewart Udall came to the
University Wednesday and ex-
plained his understanding of "the
new conservation." Udall. who
served in the cabinet of Presi-
dents Kennedy and Johnson.
is currently a Visiting Professor
in Environmental Humanism at
Yale University and the head of
a conservation consulting firm,
called the "Overview Group." In
an exclusive Pitt News interview.
Udall expatiated on a wide
range of topics. including con-
servation.

Q: What is this “new conserva-
tion” you’re talking about?)
A—Whereas one talked about con-
servation ten years ago. now
one speaks of man and his envir-
onment. It includes the con-
cept of conservation, but also it
covers cities. man and all his
activities. . .

There‘s a great need to re-
educate and reorient people. I’ve
tried to orchestrate a change of
outlook. I’ve devoted so much of
my life to this that it‘s fortunate
that I’m still involved in the same

kind of thing.

Q—Does America’s landing on
the moon constitute? a territorial
claim? ’

A—The soviets in time will land.
The pattern for the moon has been
set by the success of the inter-
national program in Antartica.
It’s scientific in nature. not ter-
ritorial imperialism.

Q—Should the United States re-
turn to Okinawa to Japan?

A—We have to recognize 25 years
after World War II that many
things in Western Europe and
the Far East must be returned to
more normal relations. Japan is
ready to assume some burden main-
taining peace and security in the
Far East. We ought to be happy
to turn Okinawa over to her.
She has the highest econonoc
growth rate in the world. We have
to change the idea that we‘re
the world's police force and begin
attacking the problems in this
country.

Q—Will ‘the American In-
dians undergo a change similar
to that which the black minority
has gone through.

A—The Indian has been isolated
out of sight and out of mind. He
hasn’t gotten nearly the attention
and support he's needed. We
haven‘t done enough. The In-
dian. because of his noncompe-
titive culture and his being con-
quered and beaten. has been pas-
sive. But now there is a militance
developing. I hope it grows. It
will make people aware of our
failure. When polled. 12 per cent
of the Indians said the U.S.
should get out of Vietnam. and
88 per cent said we should get out
of America. Young Indians are
beginning to think of some mili-
tary necessities. wether Spiro
Agnew agrees or not.

Q—What’s up with our water
supply?

A—We’ve got to develop a kind
of technology so we can use and

ization is one technique . . . Space
people who want to use the solar
system to carry off waste are do-
ing a great disservice.

Q—And Air pollution?
A—Automobiles are the worst
source of air pollution in our
country. Detroit is laggard. We
have to move more rapidly.

JoAnne Telerico

Q—Noise pollution?

A—We didn‘t begin looking at
noise as an environmental fac-
tor until five yars ago. We al-
ways looked at noise as a sign of
excitement. . . .Noise level has
doubled every ten years. Noise
abatement is just beginning in
this country with the building of
new jet aircraft.

Q—-You’ve often mentioned an-
other problem, the population
explosion and land squeeze. " '

A—We need to level off our pop-

ulation. We can master our«en--
vironmental problems only if we . 

encourage this leveling off. The
old generation believed in un-

limited growth. The new genera- “

tion has shown a slower growth._

I)isillusioiierl By Peace Corps

by DANA VENTRIGLIA
Staff Writer

JoAnne Telerico graduated
from the University last April
with degrees in Political Science
and East Asian Studies. She left
Pittsburgh soon after to join the
Peace Corps. an organization that
had always been here dream. She
recently left the Peace Corps
and has returned to Pittsburgh.’
greatly disillusioned. Miss Teler-
ico was not alone in feeling this
way. She said that after al-
most four months. approximately
fifty percent of the original‘ train-
ing group had left. and a lot of
idealism was shattered.

Miss Telerico was placed in
an agricultural training group, and,
after going through intensive
training in that field, was sent
to Malasia to aid in organizing
a program to help raise the agri-
cultural level of the country. She
stated that her disillusionment
was actually two-fold.

A large part of her disillusion-
ment was technical. It commenc-
ed with a training program
that was considered by most
volunteers to be a failure. Miss
Telerico feels that the program
was poorly planned and that the
volunteers were poorly trained.
To complement this, “ most of
the trainees had had no pre-
vious knowledge or training in
the field of agriculture, which
made it extremely difficult to
go to Malaysia, an agricultural
country, and tell lifelong farmers
how to farm. When asked what she

expected to gainfrom the Peace
Corps, Miss Telerico said, “I ex-
pected to get a lot more out of the
Peace Corps than I could contri-
bute. however. I did expect to
contribute something and I was
at the point where . . . I felt that
I was really equipped to offer
them (the people of Malaysia)
nothing."

Besides feeling that she was un-

equipped to offer the people of .

Malaysia? any technical skills.
Miss Telerico felt that she was, in
effect. helping to destroy the
Malaysian culture. "Although
Westernization is not an objec-
tive of the Peace Corps. it is
almost inevitable." Miss Telerico
stated that she had hoped for a
little fulfillment and a little con-
fidence besides wishing to reach
a cultural understanding by work-
ing side by side with the peo-
ple. After ‘arriving in Malaysia.
she realized that this would be
impossible to do this because the
Malaysian people don’t desire
to work that closely. Ameri-
cans in Malasis are set apart im-
mediately because our culture is
regarded so highly; almost to the
point where it is put on a ped-
estal.

Miss Telerico was fortunate
in that she was thought to be not
an American, but a Mediterrean.
Because of this, she was able to
learn a lot about Malaysian at-
titudes toward American people.
Miss Telerico feels that the Peace
Corps is basically not liked, al-
though the Malaysian’ people

Miss Telerico does think that

the fact that a racial problem ex.-I —

making it much more difficult to

In general, Miss Telerico said I in

that although she was able to gain
some insight through her efforts,

it was on the whole a great emo- ‘

tional shock to realize that the

Peace Corps wasn’t what. she  

wanted or expected. “It is very

a badly shattered dream.” She

thinks that the Peace Corps claims A

Bureaucracy exists, but they don’t _  _ ,7

like to face the fact that they’re
all that impersonal.

A group of former Peace Corps? ' '

volunteers have formed an organ-

Miss Telerico is not yet sure that
this should be so, but she is ready

to say that there is a lot of improve- I .

the Peace Corps could work, pos-

a little bit, and if it began to say,‘
“We are for technical, economic

Staff Writer

We Bombed in New Haven,
the newest release by the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Theatre, is
certainly one of the most dy-
namic and provacative plays to
be presented by this group. Writ-
ten by Joseph Heller, author of
Catch-22, this play, his first, is
destined to join the ranks of the
all time greats of theatre produc-
tions.

As the play begins, the audience

is cascaded by a barrage of music.

visual effects, and a group of
actors, hustling around setting up
the scenery. A song is perform-
ed, while a blinding strobe light
flashes, and the soldiers and idiots
move about in exagerated slow
motion. A seemingly normal be-
ginning permits the audience to
drop its guard. only to find that
it is drawn into the stage contro-
versy later in the play.

As the first act continues, the
audience becomes trapped in a di-
mension somewhere between real-
ity and the make believe world of
the stage. The actors talk to the
audience, telling them that this is
only a play, and boasting that they
should have a better part. As they
strive to convince the viewers that
it is only a play, one notices that
there is doubt among some of the
cast members, and gets a very
strong feeling that there is some-
thing more going on, than a group
of actors giving a play.

The disappearance of Corporal

- Sinclair, played by William Cam-

bell, and the subsequent search
for the lost man by Sgt. Hen-
derson give one the feeling that

/ all is not right. Henderson, play-

ed by Gregory Lehane, realizes
that what is happening on the
stage is far closer to reality than
he would like it to be, and later

possibly the play), since the script
calls for his death in a bombing

The outstanding performance of
the three main characters adds to
the audience’s curiosity as to what‘s
really going on up there. Val May-
er, as Captain Starky. the smiling
wishy-washy man Friday of the
Major, turns in an outstanding
performance. His marriage to Ruth.

much agony in the final scene of
the play, when he realizes that
his years of indecision have caus-
ed him to make the greatest sac-
rifice of his life.

This fantastic portrayal of the
Captain causes agony to many
more than just Mayer. as the au-
dience finds it is far to easy to
identify with the spineless. almost
pathetic captain. The brilliant
performance by Mayer is the

needed two or three diller-

you went through more than

DREAM SYMBOLISM

There are many dimensions of
experience in dreams and»with-
in these dimensions various sym-
bols can contain significance.
Symbols do not always represent
reality. but they involve senses
and ideas. If a person dreams
about washing or dyeing his
hair. this may symbolize his ideas
about growing up or growing old.
Hair is also a social youth symbol
—-of freedom. carefreeness. and to-
getherness.

Some symbols have deep biolo-
gical and cultural roots. such as
symbols related to birth and
death. The purpose of interpre-
tating a dream and the symbols
within it is to expand a persons’
consciousness so that he can ex-
perience more fully what he is
saying and what place he holds
in his world.

Dreams about mirrors and win-
dows are said to symbolize the
impersonal. regimented world:
a world made only of reflections
and images of people. not real,
responsive people.

A symbol may be an audi-
tory one, used by language. or a
movement. as used in gestures.
Mushrooms, trees. unbrellas. and
owls are symbols of unfolding
and growth. Symbols of energy
are eyes and bellows. Death is

symbolized in an unwound spool
of thread or a pierced heart.

Numbers in dreams are also sym-
bolic. The number five might
mean action and social relation-
ship because of the five fingers of
the hand. symbol of action and
communication. Zero symbolizes
nothingness and death. Seven. in
folklore a mystic number. appears
to stand for destiny: and eight is
frequently used with the connota-
tion of infinity.

In dreams. an engine is likely
to symbolize the dreamers‘ feel-
ing of inner power — his “driv-
ing force." Because of the pur-
poses a fence serves in walking
life. in dreams it most often sym-
bolizes: l) the dreamers feeling
of being imprisoned emotion-

- ally ("fenced in"): 2) the dream-

er's feeling that he's being-or
should be — kept from something
or someone he desires.

Diamonds most often point to

. the dreamer’s concern with mo-

ney and financial security. but
more often they represent love
or the wish to be loved (associa-
ted with engagements. weddings.
marriage).

When a puppet appears as a
prop in a dream. it re-
veals the dreamer’s image of him-
self manipulated by others. un-
able to control his own destiny.

or the dreamer’s desire to see
another person (usually some-
one feared) as helpless and easy
to control as a puppet.

Choking is. of course a hostile.
aggressive action. and in a dream
most commonly indicates the
dreamer’s belief that someone is
squeezing out his own life — that
he's in mortal danger.

Driving a vehicle in dreams in-
dicates that the dreamer has — or
would like to have control over
his destiny. However. the way
in which the dreamer handles the
vehicle reveals still more about
his inner feelings; if the driver
speeds recklessly. losing control of
the car and crashing. it indicates
that the dreamer has impulses he
fears he may not be able to con-
trol. Or if the driver tires and
asks someone to take over. it in-
dicates he only wishes independ-
ence so long as it demands little
effort.

Foods can also be symbolic in
dreams. So if you ever dream about
eating rice after a long night
of tortuous studying and reading.
it might be telling you that you
are suffering from an overabun-
dance of instruction and learn-
ing and it is time to take a
break.

WHAT’S IN A DREAM

DREAM: An illusory or hallucinatory psychic activity particular-
ly of a perceptual — visual nature. that occurs during sleep.

This is a compact. scientific definition of the universal phenom-
enon of dreaming. The dream process is far more complex than this
definition implies however.

The dream represents mental activity during sleep. These activi-
ties include perception. imagination. association of ideas and images
and emotion. Decision-making and reality testing are activities which
are gladly impaired in dreaming. which accounts for incoherency in
dreams.

Until recently. dream research was dependent upon the subjective
reports of the dreamer. Investigation of the dream phenomena has
become more reliable through the use of electroencephalograms (EEG)
or the recording of brain waves. During a typical night of sleep. a
person goes through sleeping cycles of about 90 minute duration.
These fluctuate between stages of light and deep sleep. The EEG
pattern varies with different depth stages. Dreaming seems to occur
only during a light stage that emerges from a deep sleep.

Researchers have also found it necessary to record the amount
and pattern of eye movements during sleep. EEG patterns typical of
dreaming are accompanied by jerky. rapid eye movements. usually of
a horizontal or scanning nature. It was found that each period of rapid
eye movements (REM’s) was followed by one of no rapid eye move- ~
ments (NREM's). Thus it is presumed that dreaming occurs during in-
tervals of light sleep accompanied by REM’s.

A Dreaming occurs in cycles. appearing when the dreamer emerges
from a deep sleep stage. On the average. a person dreams from one to
two "hours every night. This may be divided into three to five dream
periods lasting from ‘20-30 minutes. There is no time condensation in
dreams. Thus. an event lasts as long in a dream as it would in a wak-
ing state.

Dream Supplement

  
 

There are also secondary physical indications that dreaming is
taking place. There is a reduction in bodily motility as if spellbound
by the dream. Also. an increase in heart and respiration rates is

experienced. This is connected with emotional excitement produced by
the dream.

this fact accounted for the tinge

And what could he say? He stood
up slowly, careful to maintain his
balance on the loose, cindery

“Oh, nothing.”

She stared at him as he stood
there. not like a defiant young god
(or statue) amid the glowing coals
and flickering fingers of flame
(now. really). but like a boy on a
skateboard. his arms out to main-
tain his balance. to keep him from
falling over the edge.

He stood naked on the top of a
steep-sided pile of charred rocks
and cinders. His skin was darken-
ed by smoke from the fire below.
but the flames were not yet high
enough to scorch his flesh.

“Yes, Iknow. Help me.”

“Do you want me to get you

He licked the black bitterness
from his lips. “No. Hold out your

And. to her surprise. she mov-

to the edge and extended her arm.

“Move closer to the edge. I
can’t reach you.”

Her eyes caught the sudden in-

She jerked her hand away and
straightened up. Startled. he near-
ly fell forward; the cinders be-
neath him shifted and tumbled into
the flames. He leaned back to re-
gain his balance. then turned to
the center of the mound.

“Is there anything else I can
do?” she asked.

“No, I guess not.”

He watched her turn and walk
away. his mouth filled with the

Then he crouched down near the

Streaking Lions
Oppose Paitthers

byEVANPATTAK

Penn State Coach Joe Pa-
terno and Panther mentor
Carl DePasqua seem to have
forgotten that their teams
clash tomorrow. The coaches
are engaged in an effusive ex-
change of praise that would seem
more appropriate to the Every
other Wednesday Afternoon"
Bridge Club than to the impending
gridiron skirmish.

Paterno, however, wants to be
certain that his Nittany Lions
aren’t caught dreaming of sun-
shine-soaking, orange-squeezing,
and Missouri Tiger-taming. Over
confidence has been the bane of
many a bowl-bound team, and
Paterno would hate to see his
streak of 27 consecutive games
without a loss snapped before his
New Year’s date at Miami.

The Coach will remind his
players to keep their feet on
the ground, which is something they
have" done all season. Quarter-
back Chuck Burkhart has at-
tempted only 80 passes through
the first eight games; his leading
receiver, split end Greg Ed-
monds, has caught but 15 of
those passes. In fact, Penn State’s
opponents have thrown more of-
ten for more yardage, though this
may reflect the fact that they
found themselves in trouble
early.

3%.

CHARLIE PITTM AN
Senior Speedster

Nevertheless, the run has been
the most effective weapon of the
Penn State potent attack. Half-
back Lydell Mitchell replaced
injured All-American Charlie
Pittman and has scampered for
571 yards and a neat 6.3 aver-
age. Franco Harris, also a second-
stringer, hustled Don Abbey out
of his fullback job and leads the
team in scoring.

MIKE REID
Heisman Candidate

Recovering from his early-sea-.
son injury, Pittman has return-
ed to pick up over 500 yards.
These men spearhead a Penn
State ground game that has out-
rushed its opposition by a near 2-1
margin. V

The other side of this story is,
of course, the defense. Mike Reid
and Steve Smear, All—Americans
last year, are two of the finest
tackles in the nation. Panther
Coach DePasqua rates Reid
ahead of Notre Dame’s Mike Mc-
Coy, and many pro scouts con-
cur. Reid and Smear are backed
up by an agile trio of lineback-
ers led by Dennis Onkotz, who is
one of the few linebacker-punt-
returners in the history of the
game.

Safety Neal Smith, a walk-on
as a sophomore, has picked off
eight enemy aerials. The defense
has also blocked three punts and
has been directly responsible for
putting 87 points on the board.

Penn State closes its regular
season next week against North
Carolina State. A victory there
plus a win tomorrow would give
the Lions their second straight un-
defeated season. Critics of Penn

State scoff at this achievement, .

pointing to the anemic schedule
granted the Lions.

An angry Paterno replied to the
barbs by offering his team's sche-
dule as one of the nations tough-
est. He noted the performances of
Colorado and Kansas State. two
of Penn State's early victims.
The critics responded with Boston
College and Maryland. who have
given little trouble to anyone.
Paterno and his team will be an-
xious to still all charges by copping
another Orange Bowl victory.

Eastern Recognition:

What Does It Take?

Analysis by MARTHA HARTLE
Sports Editor

It’s hard to believe the naivete of the Eastern
sports writers who to this date have failed to re-
cognize the Panthers as a legitimate Eastern foot-
ball power.

Although having beaten all Eastern opposition
(Navy, Syracuse and Army) thus far this season,
the Panthers have week after week failed to appear
in the Lambert Trophy standings which supposedly
are a measureof football supremacy in the East.

According to the current standings, the Panthers
are not even considered among the top six teams in
the East. Penn State is first, followed by Dart-
mouth, Boston University, Syracuse, Yale and Vill-
anova.

We do not challenge Penn State’s right to the
number one spot, yet. That will be decided tomor-
row at the Stadium. But after examining season
records plus the caliber of the opposition, we
strongly believe that the Panthers are right-
fully the number two team in the East.

Syracuse definitely belongs in the Lambert stand-
ings; they should be right behind the Panthers.
The 21-20 Cat win over Syracuse, combined with the
Orangemen’s‘ unimpressive showing against inept
Navy, should be reason enough to entitle the Jun-
gle Cats a higher ranking than the New Yorkers.

And although the remaining “ranked” teams all
possess impressive won-loss records, while the Pan-
thers stand 4-5, it’s necessary to examine who these
so—called Eastern. leaders have been winning
against.

Four of the five Panther oppressors have lost a
total of only five games all year, while three of the
five are nationally ranked. Meanwhile, Boston Uni-
versity has gone up against such powers as Colgate,
Vermont, Massachusetts, Lafayette, Maine, Con-
necticut, Rhode Island and Delaware, while Vill-
anova has played a schedule which included Day-
ton, Santa Clara, Delaware, Xavier and Toledo.
Toledo, the only impressive team on the
Wildcat schedule, defeated them.

Dartmouth (8-0) and Yale (6-2) are leaders in the
Ivy League and while they may be powerful teams
in their league, we challenge any Ivy League
squad to step onto the field with a major Eastern
independant. '

Perhaps the voting on the Lambert poll has turn-
ed into more of a political contest than one meas-
uring the quality of Eastern football. Considering
the performances of the Panthers against major
Eastern opposition, we consider the current Lam-
bert standings a farce and urge the committee to
either re-evaluate its purpose in conducting such a
poll or abolish these invalid rankings in the future.

Booters Battle For Winning S

by BILL NAAB

Despite recent inactivity
and bad weather, the soccer-
men are pointing toward
their fourth consecutive vic-
tory of the season tomorrow
at Penn State.

GUS TH EOFILIS
Frosh Lineman

Coach Leo Bemis’ booters
haven’t confronted an opponent
since they nipped CMU 1-0, No-
vember eighth. Due to inclement
weather the booters have been
forced to cancel several practices
within the past week, but Bemis
still expects his squad to be ready
for Penn State.

“Inactivity doesn’t help,” he
remarked, “but the guys won’t for-
get how to play. If anything,
Penn State has been more in-
active than we’ve been. It’s
been two weeks since their last
game, and they’ve also had sim-
iliar weather conditions.”

Last season the soccermen
tied the Nittany Lion booters 1-1.
This year the Lions have nine let-
termen returning from 1968’s
0-6-3 squad. Currently, the 10-
cal rivals have outbattled their

According to Penn
coach Herb Schmidt,
will depend immensely upon
young, inexperienced players.
His team strength is defense.
Schmidt considers the blend of
fullbacks Phil Sears and Chuck
Messner and Halfback Glenn Dit-
zler essential to a robust de-
fense. ‘

Bemis’ team is also composed of
underclassmen. yet he has men-
tioned that his squad has progres-
sed by tremendous strides. How-
ever. One of the un_derclass-

men. Tony Nicholakopolous. will

Another factor which could

damage the soccermen’s chances
is academics. Many players
are responsible for midterms and
papers due this week and next.

“Lots of tests hit us in No-
vember. Actually, there’s no week
that tests don’t hinder us at this
time of year. I’m told that the
academic pace for athletes is
rougher here than it is in the Ivy

difficulties which have recentl
