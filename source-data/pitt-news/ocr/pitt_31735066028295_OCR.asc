New curriculum blends science and humanities

Lisa Grzyboski

Senior Staff Writer

A In its newest degree program,
Pitt is now providing the tools that
students need to study the environ-
ment and its effects on the earth and
living organisms. A

The bachelor of arts in environ-
mental studies is offered through
the Department of Geology and
Planetary Science. It is the first pro-
gram in the Pittsburgh region to mix
a wide variety of disciplines in the
arts and sciences. The curriculum
gives students a fundamental under-
standing of earth’s systems and the
environment.

By providing an interdiscipli-
nary framework spanning the scien-
tific fields of biology, chemistry and
geology and the humanities-based
studies of law, business, public pol-
icy and ethics, students will be able
to prepare for a number of environ-
mental—related careers.

“It is certainly one of the most
multidisciplinary majors of its kind
in the country,” said Harold Rollins,
joint professor of geology and plan-
etary studies and anthropology. “We
involved not only CAS, but also the
law school, the school of public
health, the business school and
other degree programs.

“We are enabling students to
choose from one of two tracks, one
more science-based and the other
more rooted in the humanities,”
Rollins said.

Rollins explained that in recent
years, faculty advisers in the geolo-
gy and planetary science department
saw many students struggling to put
together an environmental major on
their own because Pitt didn’t have a
program that did it for them.

With the emergence of environ-
mental science as an important field
of study and the overwhelming
interest of ‘new and old faculty

Student Health Services will be giving stu-
dents the opportunity to learn how to save a life
through three health programs during the next
month.

The first two programs — which are certifi-
cation classes -—- prepare students to handle
emergencies where first aid and CPR can mean
the difference between life and death. The third
program will help students look after themselves
by providing measles, mumps and rubella vac-
cines.

All of these services are being offered in the
Student Health Services’ offices on the fifth ﬂoor
of the Medical Arts Building along Fifth Avenue.

The first aid certification seminar is being
offered in conjunction with the American Red
Cross.

“Anyone can participate,” said Shirley
Haberman, Health Education Administrator for
Student Health Services. “It is especially useful
for students studying the health professions.
Sometimes, it’s even a requirement for their pro-
gram.”

The University was taken over
yesterday by glamorous women and
smiling guys in ties.

Their images dominated every

bulletin board on campus. The signs H

begged the reader to vote for them as
Homecoming king or queen.

The smorgasbord of posters plas-
tered around Oakland during
Homecoming week is a tradition, but
some candidates
found more interest-
ing ways to campaign
in the contest.

Many candidates
are not the Barbie and
Ken cardboard
cutouts who one typically associates
with the Homecoming king and
queen. '

These are the people who just
want to have fun in what has been
called “the great popularity contest.”

Jeremy Hancher is running for
Homecoming king. He says that his
posters are more like clips from
Animal House than traditional, stuffy
Homecoming campaign posters.

“We just wanted to do something
fun to liven up the place,” Hancher
said. “I was at Penn State last week-

end, and people were hanging out
the windows screaming. The place
was crazy. Then I came back here,
and it was dead.”

Students walking through the
Towers courtyard yesterday were
surrounded by candidates’ support-
ers, who were handing out pictures
of their candidate along with pieces
of candy.

This was not the case for candi-
dates Jen “LJ” Werner and Brad
Wuerstle. They instead held students
who passed by at
squirtgun-point,
sprinkled glitter on
people’s arms and
bounced around a
beach ball that had
“Vote for Brad and
LJ” written on it in black marker.

Wuerstle held a box of cigarettes
and announced that he had “free icy-
cold emphysema” for anyone who
would cast a vote for him. '

One of the candidates had part of
the Pitt marching band playing in her
support. The Werner-Wuerstle gang
responded by banding together and
singing “Brad and LJ” lyrics which
overpowered the words sung by the
other candidate’s supporters.

Hancher went about the whole

Wednesday, 17 September 1997 THE PITT NEWS A

Local bar shows its stuff in Playboy magazine  
’The Aﬂic’ recognized as one of America's top 100 college bars  

-Rebecca Riddle
For The Pitt News

Everyone knows where it
is and almost everyone has
been there.

And, according to
Playboy magazine, everyone
who has walked up the three
steep flights of stairs to get
to The Attic made a good
choice.

The popular Oakland
bar, located on Forbes
Avenue, recently made
Playboy’s first-ever list of
the top 100 college bars in
America.

Owner Ron Levick was
surprised when he was first
contacted about six months
ago with the news.

“I didn’t believe it. I said
‘Yeah, sure  whatever,”’
Levick said.

He did believe -the news,
however, once he received a
letter telling him that his bar

_ would be listed in the
October 1997 issue of
Playboy.

The national survey was
conducted by Beyond the
Wall, a campus marketing
firm that makes posters for
college dorms and fraternity
houses.

Beyond the Wall ranked
bars on the college circuit by
making random phone calls
to college students around
the country and through
internet surveys on its cor-
porate web site -at
www.beyondthewall.com.i

The criteria included in
the survey focused on each
bar’s atmosphere, service
and prices.

Most Pitt students will
say The Attic is known for
these qualities, considering
its unique location three
ﬂoors above Fifth Avenue
and its plethora of entertain-
ment. The bar houses 13
televisions (one of them a
big screen) strategically
placed around the bar, seven
pool tables, electronic dart
boards and live band
two or three nights a
week.

‘‘It’s

atm_os=
phere,,
g o o d A
m u s i c , ” 3
said Jim
Palochik,
Pitt graduate «
who has been a regular at
The Attic for four years.

According to bargoers,
atmosphere is important.

“I think it’s nice because
there aren’t 500 people

a

‘crowded in here at once,”

said Taryn Giunta, a Pitt
senior. “A lot of the other
bars are just crazy college
kids.

“Here, everyone’s just
laid back, having a good
time,” she said.

Older students are
impressed with the bar’s
ability to keep out the under-
2l’crow’d.

“There are no underage
people here,” observed
Corey Alexander, a Pitt
senior.

In addition to the pool
tables and bands, Palochik
said the outdoor deck is what
makesa stop at The Attic so
enjoyable for him.

“It’s a nice place to sit
and relax,” he noted.

             esvtseybovMaaazrs»e .     -
Sorry, guys. Everyone rea 5 ll’ for l'he articles, anyway.

 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 

 

Neil Grant, a Scottish
tourist visiting Pittsburgh,
said a Pittstudent recom-
mended The Attic as a great

place for shooting pool and _

“just hanging out.”

Another lure for college
students is The Attic’s daily
specials, which include its
famous 25—cent drafts on
Thursday nights and its

He said

Wednesday-night “buck
nights,’-’ when all draft beers,
domestic bottled beers and
mixed drinks are only $1.

Other Pennsylvania col-
lege bars listed by Playboy
include Wolfendale’s at IUP,
Smokey Joe’s at the
University of Pennsylvania
and the Gingerbread Man at
Penn State.

Levick said he plans to
have the magazine article
mounted on the wall, but he
does not think the ranking
will affect business.

“It’s just a nice honor,”
he commented. “People
can be like ‘Hey! I have a
reason for liking [The Attic]
now.”’ p

Levick said he has
received congratulations
from many people.

“I got to tease‘ people
and say, ‘Oh, you read
Playboy ...?”’

affair in a lower—key fashion.

“I don’t have the funds to go all
out,” Hancher explained.

Hancher’s supporters handed out
pictures of him posing for mug shots
complete with a fake “Pittsburgh
City Jail” sign. The caption above
the picture read, “I made parole to be
your king!” Other pictures showed
Hancher lying on a couch with a pot
on his head while saying, “Don’t be
a pothead.”

According to Hancher, he wanted
to buy a keg of nonalcoholic beer
and give out free samples during the
election. He said, however, that the
Homecoming committee would not
permit this.

But as people passed by

Hancher’s

was slightly misan-
thropic. Unlike
many of his oppo-
nents, he refused to
run up and try to
talk passers—by into
voting for him.
“I’m not going
to pretend we’re
friends just
because it’s election
day,” said Hancher.
This was a nice
change for students
like James Vause, -
who ventured through the jungle of
hands offering pictures and candy
with his arms pulled inside his shirt
so he had no hands with which to

He said

' __ accept the offered
1 goods.

“lt’s'a shame-
less attempt to
persuade some-
one’s opinion,”
Vause said.’

Vause walked
through the crowd
saying he was
sorry that he could
not accept their
pictures or gifts
— he said he sim-
ply had no arms.

Unlike other
- candidates,
Hancher’s plans were not as well
thought out. He claims he decided to
run for Homecoming king at the last
minute.

“We put the whole thing together
in about 10 minutes,” said Charlie
Greenberg, one of Hancher’s sup-
porters. “We took the pictures and
ran them down to have them devel-
opedf’

Hancher said he feels like he has
a» chance to win. He said the whole
point of Homecoming is to have fun
and be a little wild.

Chip Meisel, a Hancher support-
er, said that Hancher appeals to the
people who would not usually vote.

“We’ll—have a big party if we

win, and we’ll have a big party if I /

Clinton seeks GOP support for tariff negotiation power

Across the Nation

RICHMOND, Va.— A product that
may be in your kitchen drawer right
now celebrated its 50th birthday-
Reynolds Wrap.

The aluminum foil was
unveiled at a department store in
Richmond 50 years ago Tuesday.
Millions of miles of foil later,
employees celebrated the event
with cake and free foil for every-
one. ‘
Reynolds officials said their
product was discovered by acci-
dent——-when an executive couldn’t
find a roasting pan for his wife on
Thanksgiving Day and gave her
some experimental foil instead.
Officials said they’re still answer-
ing one common question about
Reynolds Wrap 50 years later: they
said it doesn’t make any difference
whether you use the shiny or dull
side of the foil.

PHILADELPHIA—A sentencing
hearing opened Tuesday in the case
of John G. Bennett Junior who is

accused of cheating charity groups
of more than $100 million in a mas-
sive Ponzi scheme —— also known
as a financial “pyramid” racket.

Prosecutors renewed their con-
tention that Bennett financed a lav-
ish lifestyle with money swindled
from more than 500 church groups,
museums, colleges and philan-
thropists.

His attorney says Bennett suf-
fered delusions while running the
bankrupt foundation for New Era
Philanthropy. He said greed had
nothing to do with it.

Bennett pleaded no contest in
March to 82 counts of money laun-
dering and fraud. He had wanted to
plead innocent, but a federal judge
undercut his legal argument — that
a personality disorder and brain
damage from two car accidents
turned Bennett into a religious
zealot who did not believe his
scheme was wrong.

WHITE HOUSE— President
Clinton has headed to Capitol Hill
to twist some Democratic arms

over trade. Clinton submitted legis-
lation giving him authority to nego-
tiate deals that lower tariffs.

Speaking to reporters before
stepping into his limousine, the
president said America faces a cru-
cial choice — whether to continue
as a world leader in trade, or to
shrink from competition.

The president was counting on
support from GOP leaders.
However, many Democrats oppose
him — and labor unions are plan-
ning an advertising onslaught. They
contended that free trade allows
companies to move production
overseas, where worker rights and
pollution controls are few.

Clinton and Vice President
Gore hoped to convince Democrats
they can strike bargains that won’t
undercut environmental legislation.

PITTSBURGH—Shoppers have
been digging deeper into their
pockets to buy women’s clothing in
the Pittsburgh area. In the past year,
the price of women’s and girls’
apparel went up 29 percent.

Most of that increase was
because separates and sportswear
cost more.

A spokeswoman for Federal
Labor Statisticians said one or two
retail chains may account for wild
swings in clothing prices. She said
the market for women’s clothing
was soft a year ago.

ERIE, Pa.—Megan’s Law has got-
ten another challenge;

A defense attorney in Erie said
a state investigator violated his
client’s rights during a recent
Megan’s Law interview. The man
was convicted of performing oral
sex on a 13-year-old boy in a park
in Wesleyville last year.

The interviewer was trying to
find out if the man was a “violent
sexual predator.” But the defense
attorney said he should have been
present. And, he said his client was
not advised of his Miranda rights.
The matter will be sorted out at a
hearing on Oct. 6.

greater depth and breadth.
In looking at the

resources available

Rollins said Pitt u l t y
looked at other nation- m e m -
ally known schools such b e r s
as Harvard University wanted
and the Rochester t 0
Institute of h in c 1 u d e
Technology, which szé’ as many
have similar pro- 63 courses as possible from each of

  

grams. The
University also
sought ’ the
advice of
environmen-
tal, business and
pub1ic—policy offi-
cials when deciding what courses to
offer and what core group of classes
to require. Student input also played
a large factor.

The result was a program that
combined three basic components:

-Core courses providing a basic
understanding of environmental
processes, policy issues and field
study.

°Co-requirements providing the
necessary background for later
advanced study.

-Electives in the natural and
social sciences allowing students to
explore environmental issues in

Pitt’s graduate and undergraduate
schools.

“This University has a lot of
resources that many of the other local
universities don’t have,” said
Rosemary Capo, assistant professor
of geology and planetary science.
“There are people in ‘all kinds of
fields, which means that they are
already here; we don’t have to hire
them. We really have a lot of the
expertise already in place.”

But while it was evident that Pitt
had the resources and faculty for a
degree of this breadth, it was a seem-
ingly uphill battle getting administra-
tors to allow undergraduate students
to take graduate—level courses.

Large amounts of bureaucratic
red tape needed to be cut through
before the program could take off,
and even today some areas need to be
adjusted and reworked.

“There are still some rough spots,
but we are working hard to fix them,”
said Thomas Anderson, chair of the
Department of Geology and
Planetary Science. “The provost has
been very helpful in recognizing the
need to coordinate these things.”

In an effort to continually update
the program and give Pitt students a
high-quality environmental-studies
degree, the Environmental Studies
Advisory Board was formed.

Composed of a number of outside
officials from industry, governmental
offices and environmental organiza-
tions —— including Pitt Provost James
Maher and Arts and Sciences Dean
Peter Koehler —— the board seeks to
discuss what is happening in the real
world and to apply those findings to
strengthen the program.

“We want to take advantage of
the numerous business, science and
corporate connections we have,”
Capo said. “We want to keep in touch
with what is happening outside. It
wasn’t hard finding people with a
commitment in the area.

“They come in and talk about
their own experiences and things
they’ve picked up, and we listen to
what they have to say.”

In the end, the goal of the degree
program is to give Pitt students more
choices and to make them more
receptive to the world in which they
live while preparing them for their
future.

“To be an educated person today,
you have to understand the problems
of our planet,” Capo said. “I think

that a liberal-arts education has to

evolve, and this degree seems like a
logical way to move towards that. It
provides students with enough of a
background that they will be prepared
and have a degree of ﬂexibility.”

Martha Riecks, one of the more
than 60 students currently enrolled in
the program, agreed, saying, “After
taking a wide assortment of arts and
sciences courses, you really begin to
see how things relate and how they
interconnect.”

“I think this degree will help to
attract more students to Pitt,” Riecks
added. “I know many other students
who are doing it because there is such
a widevariety of classes and there is
the opportunity for ﬂexibility.”

There are more important
things than class sometimes

Billy West doesn’t have to go to classes tonight and
Thursday night because of the Homecoming game.
Good ’

We’re glad to see that some professors have realized there
are sometimes more important things than classes. There are
things that will improve students’ lives immeasurably and will
far outdo the beneﬁts of sitting in a lecture hall. We’d like to
commend teachers who have realized the importance of
things like this, because there are still many self-irnportant
professors who consider it a personal insult when you’re not
in their class. A lot of learning goes on outside the classroom

West is a good student, and he has proved time and time
again that he is dedicated to his class work. Tlrat’s why he
came here, and why most of us came here: to get an educa-

tion, because very few ever get to play in the NFL for any I

extended period of time.

The experience of playing in a Homecoming game in
front of thousands of your peers, representing all that is good
in NCAA football, is going to stay in West’s and the specta-
tors’ minds far longer than a couple of hours of classes with
boring names like “Construction lnfonnation Systems” and
“Construction Finance and Cost Control.” These may very
well be interesting classes for some, but they will also be there
for another 11 weeks. Homecoming won’t.

Many events that students ought to attend will not be
around for a whole semester“. job interviews, visiting speakers,
out-of-state conferences, friends and relatives who are only in
town for a few days, campus events like Homecoming and
Vice President Gore’s biennial photo-op at Pitt, and even get-
ting to look on a clear night at a comet that may be escorting
an alien spaceship can be important, life-changing events.

_ Too many classes start out with a syllabus that says some-
thing like, “Only one unexcused absence will be allowed
Further absences will count against your grade unless accom-
panied by a medical excuse.” -

Listen: It’s our nickel. We’re paying for our own classes,
and we are adults who can decide for ourselves how much we
need to be there to learn the material.

We will be in class as much as we need to be. Making
attendance mandatory is stupid. If the only way to gauge what
your students learn is by counting their missed classes, and
not by testing them on the material, then perhaps you should
question the importance of what you’re teaching.

Class: Just stop, drop and clis-enroll

The add/drop period ended last .

Tuesday, and most students have
come to the realization that it’s drink
or swim. It’s time to either devote the
rest of your waking hours to the
study of that phonebook-sized psy-
chology text, or to take that oft-trav-
eled road and survive in an alcoholic
stupor until Dec. 13 — the beloved
“last day of exams.”

It’s too bad that no one consid-
ered adding a note in the course-
description book warning students
that the class you agreed to spend 15
weeks of your life in has been shown
to put small animals and senior citi-
zens into four—year comas.

The ﬁrst week is a good time to!’

ﬁgure out how interesting will be the
classes that you picked in the four-
hour registration queue last spring.
So, as a public service, I have
devised a list of questions that you
should ask yourself as you look
around the classroom next term
when deciding whether or not to
drop the class:

1) What do the used textbooks
look like? A good indicator of
whether you’ll want to bring a note-
book or a case of calfeine pills to
class is how others have handled the
rigors of its instruction. If more than
three used texts resemble coloring
books for highlighter aﬁcionados,
you’re in trouble.

Other signs that the class may
be rougher than indicated by its
“undergraduate listin ” include
scrapsofpaperleftinthebookthat
resemble failed quizzes, incomplete
theses and rough drafts of suicide
notes. Pages coated in dried blood
alsofallunderthecategoryof “things
to look out for.”

If more than three used texts are
still in their original plastic wrapper,
you’re probably in good hands. This
rule, however, does not apply to pre-
medicine, mathematics or classes in
any other subject that often cause
people to reﬂect on how much they

Mane

really want to live and eventually to
renounce all worldly possessions to
join a convent in the recesses of
Mongolia. ,

2) How did your professor greet
the class? You’ll want to look out for
the following phrases:

“Hi. I don’t give A’ s, B’s or C’s.
Now open your boo 

“Hi. I don’t believe in letter
grades. They violate our 

“Hola. Yo no hablo Ingles.”

“Dude, if knees were, like,
backwards, what would your desks
look like?”

“Bonjour, cette classe est
impossible.”

“I’m not really a professor yet,
but the junior community college
where I worked for 12 years called
me one.”

3) What do the people in your
classroom do when the professor
asks a question? If you just
answered, "Their best imitation of a
morgue scene in a silent ﬁlm,” then
you have a distinct problem

Asking if you’re in the wrong
class is okay. Wanting to ask that
same question every day for three
weeks is not okay.

Remember: You cannot count
on the teacher to curve the grades,
even if everyone has_ a better chance
of passing a Yugo—sized kidney stone
than the course. The same semester
youcountontheprofessortopass
everyone in his thermodynamic
quantum physics IV class is the
semester he’ll decide to give up
teaching, begin worshipping the let-
ter“F’ and sellherbalmedication out
of the back of a Volkswagen bus in

THE PITT NEWS

Santa Monica. At least when you ﬁn-
ish beating yourself senseless after
you fail the course, you’ll be able to
get a decent deal on some witch
hazel.

And look out for the other
extreme: Too much action after your
instructor asks a question isn’t good,
either.

If a majority of your class is
made up of people who lapse into a
synchronized ritual of thrusting their
arms into the air and grunting (close-
ly resembling participants in Richard
Simmons’ “Sweatin’ to the Oldies”
videos) upon hearing the sound of
your instructor’s voice, bail.

4) Can you understand your
professor? If you walk into a class-
room and realize that you feel like
you’re trapped in a National
Geographic documentary, excuse
yourself by holding both hands in ﬂre
air (the international gesture for “I
just want to get out of here with all of
my body parts still attach ”) and
slowly head for the door. Again, the
exception to this rule is in the engi-
neering, pre-medical and mathemat-
ics departments where it helps to be
ﬂuent in at least 14 foreign lan-
guages, not only to learn the curricu-
lum, but to help your professor “feel
right at home.”

5) How long is your class?
Studies have shown that a majority
of learning is done in the ﬁrst half-
hour of exposure to the material.
After that period, one’s retention
dropsfasterthanasenator’spantsat
a sorority party. So it’s entirely possi-
ble that after your four-hour, once-a-
week class, you’re actually leaving
with less knowledge than you came
with.

And you thought it was all the
heavy drinking that was killing your
QPA.

Man: Nuzzo wants to. know if you
need to use a silencer when you
shoot a mime.

Hanlon getshis turn asPil1 netmincler

Patrick Robertson
Staff Writer

Chris Hanlon is the starting goalie
as a senior on this year’s Pitt men’s
soccer team, but this honor did not
come easily.

Like all athletes, Hanlon wanted to
start as soon as possible. But he had to
take a red shirt his sophomore year —
his first year as a Panther after transfer-
ring from Division 11 school Davis and

. Elkins. . '

Hanlon spent most of his junior
year on the bench, because he was
playing behind the entrenched goalie,
Adam Spitzer. Spitzer had earlier
expected to graduate but last year
received a red shirt from a previous
season, which allowed him to play in
1996.

During the off-season, Hanlon hurt

_ his ankle and was not able to practice.

He called these three occasions —

~ transferring, sitting the bench, and his
injury —- “the toughest times in my

life.”

Hanlon was very frustrated after
last spring. The only thing he could do
last year was to impress the coaching
‘staff, to .try topwin a starting position
for the 1997 season. Because of this,
Hanlon worked hard last year and dur-
ing the off-season.

Hanlon also said that “as a transfer
who hasn’t played, the guys really
wonder where you are and if you’re
really hurt.” He wanted to prove him-
self to his teammates, he stated.

Coming into the season, Hanlon

He Said

said the job was “mine to lose.” He
trained hard in the off-season for sever-
al reasons.

First of all, he was excited because

it would be his senior season. Also, he

made the Region H men’s soccer team.
That gave him the chance to play in
front of 15,000 fans at Soldier Field
against a Mexican team prior to an
L.A. Galaxy game. .
“This team got me motivated t
train for the year. I can’t explain what

it’s like to play in front of 15,000-

screaming Mexicans,” Hanlon said.

In his first game of this year,
Hanlon proved that he had earned the
starting job. Pittsburgh played defend-
ing Big East champion Notre Dame.
The Irish had a potent offense that the
Panther keeper stopped in its tracks.

.g He ended up shutting out the Irish,
and the game ended in a scoreless tie.
“The defense did a great job, and
everyone‘ has a role on the team,”
Hanlon noted. “The defense saved the
game at‘ the end of the second over-
time.” ~
This is a common theme in all of
Hanlon’s responses. Anytime he says
something about his performance, he
also mentions what a great job the rest
of the team did. He never gave himself
credit for a Panther win but instead
mentioned solid defense and some luck
and skill on offense. A
Pittsburgh had a chance to win the
game, but an Irish defender knocked
the ball out of the net with his head. As
a goalie who has seen many such saves

Burno second of hoops recruits ruled ineligible

Zachariah Blott
News Edltor

Rashon Bumo, one of eight bas-
ketball recruits who Pitt signed for
this season, is academically ineligible
to play, according to Assistant Coach
Troy Weaver.

A player is ruled academically
ineligible if his grades in high school
are poor or his SATs fall below an
800. Bumo didn’t meet the SAT qual-
iﬁcation.

In the meantime though, the 5-
foot-8 point guard has enrolled at the
Winchendon Prep School in
Massachusetts for one year, along-
with fellow Pitt recruit Chris
Seabrooks.

Neither recruit will lose a year of

playing eligibility at Pitt once they

_retum. At the end of their year at
P Winchendon, the two need to re-sign

letters of intention to play at Pitt.
Weaver says that Pitt is currently
recruiting them both to assure they do
re-sign with Pitt.

— Burno attended St. »Anthony’s
High School in Jersey City, N.J.
During his three years on the team,
his school's record was 92-3, and the
team was consistently ranked by USA
Today as one of the top 10 high
schools in the country.

Duringjhis senior year at St.
Anthony’s, Bumo averaged 10 points,
six assists and five steals per game.

‘ He holds the New Jersey state record

for steals in - a game with 10.
Recruiting magazines noted Bumo’s

speed and defense as his strongest
assets.

Seabrooks was ruled ineligible
over the summer. He’s a 6-foot-9
power forward from Georgia and
attended Thomas High School, the
same school from which Pitt’s
Vonteego Cummings graduated. Most
recruiting publications ranked
Seabrooks as one ‘of the top 100
recruits in the nation. He can also
play center.

Because of Bumo’s absence this
year, Pitt has no backup point guard
for Vonteego Cummings.‘

Weaver noted, “It [Bumo’s not
qualifying] affects our depth.” He
added, “[Starting shooting guard]
Kellii Taylor will have to play some
at the point.”

The West Virginia University
Mountaineers are coming off a 9-4 sea-
son which saw them travel to the Gator
Bowl only to lose to North Carolina.

The Mountaineers started off 8-0 last
year before tailing off after a heartbreak-
ing loss to  This year, they hope to
rely on star sophomore running back
Amos Zereoue to carry them back to a
bowl.

nents have already been able to pick up
on this weakness.

On offense, Marc Bulger has been
given the starting job at quarterback, suc-
ceeding Chad Johnston. Bulger has very
little experience and will have to learn
fast if he wishes to march the WVU back
to a bowl appearance.

Most of the skill players return to the
lineup this year, but he Mountaineers did
lose Rashan Vanterpool, their leading

career receiver. Otherwise they

Other than Zereoue, there remain very solid. Zereoue returns,
are a lot of questions to be toting the 1996 Big East Rookie of
answered about the

Mountaineers’ roster.

The first problem pops up on
defense. The Mountaineers lost 11 years
of starting experience in the secondary.
They also lost Canute Curtis, who was an
amazing force last year on the defensive
line.

The Mountaineers’ defense has been
weak in its ﬁrst three games this year. It
gave up a lot of points to ﬁrst-year
Division I opponent Marshall, and had to
rely on an offensive push near the end of
the contest for a 42-31 victory.

Senior tackle Henry Slay is a third-
year starter and needs to improve his play
in order to lead the defense. There is a lot
of experience on the Mountaineers’
defensive line, but WVU returns only

the Year award. He was hurt at the
v end of the year but had already

gained 1,035 yards. Everyone expects
great things out of this runner and he
should not disappoint, if he stays healthy.
The biggest hardship for WVU will
be the diﬂiculty of its schedule. The
Mountaineers must travel to Notre
Dame, Maryland and Syracuse late in the
season. They also host Miami and Big
East defending champion Virginia Tech.
Theteamhashadarough beginning,
barely beating Marshall, edging East
Carolina 24-17 and losing last weekend
to Boston College. The Mountaineers
had a big lead early over the Eagles, but
then collapsed to lose late in the second
half. 1

Virginia Tech

The 1996 season was the most suc-
cessful season in school history for the
Hokies of Virginia Tech. Despite losing
to Nebraska in the Orange Bowl, the
contingent from Blacksburg was one of
the hottest teams in the country.

So far in 1997, the Hokies have
picked up where they left off. They
stand alone atop the Big East at 2-0 with
wins over Rutgers (59-19) and last
week against Syracuse (31-3).

One of the biggest reasons
for Tech’s success last year was
quarterback Jim Druckemniller, a
first-round draft pick of the San
Francisco 49ers. Junior Al Clark
(12-21 passing, three TD; 12 rushes for
149 yards, one TD this season) replaces
the Big East Co-Offensive Player of the
Year at quarterback and is joined in the
backﬁeld by veteran tailback Ken
Oxendine (112 yards, three TD).

Shawn Scales (4 catches for 10
yards, one TD) and Marcus
Gildersleeve (2-85 yards, one TD)
return at the receiver slots and give
Clark some dangerous targets through
the air.

All-American Billy Conaty is gone
from the offensive line, and Hokies’
Head Coach Frank Beamer hopes that

Gennaro DiNapoli can anchor the front.

The Hokie defense was stellar in
1996 with the likes of Cornell Brown,
Brandon Semones and Torian Gray, but
they are all gone and must be replaced.

Enter a new group that includes
former walk-on John Engelberger, a
defensive end who recorded 64 tackles
and six sacks last year. Kerwin Hairston
notched 52 tackles and also got to the
QB six times in ‘96. Steve Tate is the
top returning linebacker. Tate will be

joined by Pierson Prioleau
and Jamel Smith at the
backer positions.

Loren Johnson looks to
improve upon his impressive num-
bers from last season (44 tackles
and three interceptions). Several other
will test their skills in the Hokie sec-
ondary, including Anthony Midget,
Keion Carpenter, Lorenzo Ferguson

and Steven Hunt.

Shayne Graham, who made the
ﬁrst-team All-Big East last year as a
freshman, ﬁnished second in the league
in scoring last year, hitting 10 ﬁeld
goals in 16 attempts. He has kicked 11
PATs and two ﬁeld goals so far in ‘97.

year.

After four games, the Syracuse

Orangemen are 1-3, but it’s not as
bad as it seems. After beating
Wisconsin 34-0 in the season open-
er, they dropped two heartbreakers
the next two weeks — to North
Carolina State 32-31 in overtime
and to Oklahoma 36-34.
Add a loss to Virginia Tech,
and the Orangemen drop to
what looks like near-disas-
ter levels.

But, there are some
bright spots. Donovan
McNabb’s offensive mas-
tery has come to the forefront in the
losses, Rob Konrad has established
himself as a legitimate running
back and the Orange have begun —
albeit slowly —— their campaign
toward a 1997 bowl berth.

Syracuse must rely on its
offense to win football games for
the rest of the season. McNabb, Big
East Conference Co-Offensive
Player of the Year in 1996, returns
at quarterback and will probably
throw and scramble his way to the
same honor. He led the conference
in both total offense and passing
efficiency as a sophomore last sea-
son. Despite the team’s 1-3 record,

The graduation of Malcolm
Thomas and Tebucky Jones’ move
to safety opened up the tailback
spot for junior Kyle McIntosh.
McIntosh has played strongly so far
but suffered cracked ribs against
Virginia Tech and will miss at least

Saturday’s game against
Tulane.
Wide receiver will be the
deepest spot on the team
despite the graduation of
Deon Maddox. Jim Turner is
recovering from a wrist
injury but will still be a deep
threat as well as one of the NCAA’s
top kick returners.

The three returning starters on
the offensive line, tackles Brad
Patkochis and Brent Warren and
guard Scott Kiernan, all have expe-
rience and will provide the frame-
work to hold the offensive line
together.

Thus, McNabb has protection
and an array of weapons. But when
he’s off the field

THE PITT NEWS

Temple

The Temple Owls come into this year
after a 1-10 1996, including an 0-7 mark
against Big East opponents. Head Coach
Ron Dickerson returns for his ﬁfth season
as the head man in Philadelphia and hopes
to turn things around after nearly resign-
ing from his post last season.

The Owls are coming oﬂ° a rough
week in which they lost 52-10 to Penn
State. This was after an upset over Boston
College — the team’s ﬁrst conference vic-
tory since defeating Pitt two years ago.

Temple also lost to its opening—week
opponent, Westem Michigan. With two
losses it will be very tough for the team to
make a nm at the Big East leaders.

On the defensive side of the ball, the
Owls have signed 20 new defenders out
of high school, looking to ﬁll some holes.
They also have veteran leadership, such
as linebacker Decara. Burgess, who ﬁn-
ished last season with 57 tackles.

Temple’s entire 1996 secondary
returns for the 1997 campaign. The Owls
hope to have valuable experience in their
quest to anchor this year’s defense.

Marcus Counts led the secondary last
year with 70 tackles, and will be expected
to come up with big plays this year.

Temple’s offense boasts a host of
returning starters, but the most important
piece of the puzzle will not be back.
Quarterback Henry Burris graduated after
a record-setting career“, he now owns 20
Temple and 10 Big East passing records.

Dickerson hopes his new quarter-

back, junior Pat Bonner, will be able to ﬁll
Burris’ shoes. Bonner completed 48.2
percent of his passes in limited action last
season.

Tailback Raymond Lee returns after
a 10—touchdown, 526—yard season.

The offense also took a hit at wide-
out, losing All—Big East selection Van
Johnson. Senior Kevin Walker and junior
Kenyatta Carter hope to take over receiv-
er duties.

Temple’s special teams are solid, as
both of their kickers are returning from
last year. The retum game is strong as well
—Carterrankedninthinthe BigEastin
kickoff retums last season.

Temple already had its toughest con-
test of the season when they met Penn
State This early defeat, combined with
the always-punishing Big East schedule
yet to come, could make for another tough
year for Dickerson, who may need a
strong season to save his job. The coach
already resigned once, after last year’s
loss to Pitt, but withdrew his self-terrnina-
tion and was rewarded with a contract
extension.

Dickerson carries a record of 5-39 in
four years as the Owls’ head man.

The team does boast 33 lettermen on
this year’s roster. The problem, of course,
is that these players earned their letters on
a 1-10 ballclub in 1996. Despite an early
shocker against BC, this team looks to ﬁn-
ish near or at the bottom of the Big East
once again.

They haven’t showed up yet this
season, though.

Rutgers is 0-3 and has been embar-
rassed each time out. The Scarlet
Knights opened the season with a 59-19
drubbing at the hands of Virginia Tech
and followed that up with losses to Texas
(48-14) and Navy (36-7).

Last season, Rutgers stumbled to a

2-9 mark in its ﬁrst year under Head
Coach Terry Shea. Shea returns 39 let-
terrnen, including 14 starters, from last
year’s team. Most of them are young,
which is spelling trouble in New
Brunswick.

Sophomores Mike Jones and
Brendon Edmonds have platooned at
QB. Jones has completed 21 of 51 pass-
es for 174 yards and has been picked off
four times. Edmonds is 17-30 for 227
yards and three TDs but also has been
picked off four times.

Sophomore tailback Jacki Crooks
has been a bright spot with 285 yards on
64 carries, but he hasn’t reached the end
zone yet this year.

Fullback Gary Fauntelroy anchors

the backﬁeld while senior Joe Diggs and
junior Chris Washington have seen some
limited playing time.

The receiving corps has gotten a
boost this season with the return of
senior split end Reggie Funderburk, who
missed all of 1996 with a knee injury.
Funderburk has hauled in ﬁve passes for
60 yards and one TD so far, while Walter
King has caught four balls for 98 yards
and one TD. Other targets include a slew
of veterans, including Steve Harper, Bill
Powell, Walter King and Andy Holland.

The Scarlet Knights had to replace
most of their offensive line from a year
ago thanks to graduation. Newcomers
will look to three—year starter Jack
McKieman, who anchors the line at cen-
ter. The list of candidates who have
taken over in the trenches includes
Shaun O’Hara, Pete Donnelly and Ben
French.

Inside linebacker Brian Sheridan,
who missed all of last season after shoul-
der surgery, returns to lead a defense
with seven returning starters. Sheridan,
who led the team with 132 tackles in
1995, teams up with Aaron Brady and
Taman Bryant to give Shea’s Scarlet
Knights a solid linebacking unit.

Seniors Chris Cebula and Charles
Woolridge return to man the defensive
line, but the leadership on defense will
most likely come from the secondary.

on his side of the ﬁeld, Hanlon said the
play “was frustrating, because you
don’t get many better chances than
that.”

Frustration is an ever-present part
of a goalie’s game, according to
Hanlon. In soccer, a goalie is not direct-
ly involved in every play, so it makes it

. tough for the keeper to stay concentrat-

ed and active in the contest. Hanlon
said he keeps “an air of intensity” at all
times to help him remain focused.

“I know I can’t win a game,” he
said, “but I can keep my team from los-
ing.”’

Hanlon describes himself as a per-

fectionist. If he does his job perfectly,
the team cannot lose. He also said it is
tough to be a goalie because the rnis—
takes he makes are so important in a

g game.

“If an attackman or a defender
makes a mistake, they can get away
with it,” he said. “But if I make one

mistake in a game, it usually makes the"

difference.”

Hanlon has to focus intently for 90
minutes. He says he is more tired in
games in which he has to think than in
matches in which teams get a lot of
shots and all he has to do is react to
them.

Hanlon started his collegiate-soc-
cer career by looking at a lot of
Division I schools, but none thought he

was big enough to play. He settled for
Division H’s Davis and Elkins in West
Virginia. He started a few games and
relieved in others, playing in a total of
10 contests his freshman year.

During this time, his family moved
from outside Philadelphia to Iowa. At
this point, Hanlon decided it was time
for a change. He looked around and
decided to come to Pittsburgh to play
soccer.

Hanlon called his move from
Philadelphia to Elkins a culture shock.
He was used to being in a big city, and
he missed that. Hanlon’s missing the

big city, combined with his having B

some acquaintances in greater
Pittsburgh, clinched his decision to
become a Panther.

RUTGERS

Thomas Kelly, who had 81 tackles in
nine games last year, is joined at defensive
back by junior Pete Clark and seniors
Kevin Williams and Nonis Crawford. The
secondary has been one of the biggest
weaknesses in the Rutgers defense so far
this season.

Jared Slovan, who ranked fourth
(40.6 yards per kick) in the Big East in
punting last year, has been busy so far this
year. Placekicker Nick Mike-Mayer led
the team in scoring (with just 26 points)
last season and has only two PATs so far in
‘97.

looked really, really cool storming out of i

the tunnel live on PantherV1sion.

Next, they played tough against the
top—ranked team in the nation, at the home
of the top—ranked team of the nation, in
front of 97,000 fans of the top—ranked
team in the nation.

Finally, they went on the road as an
underdog and beat -Houston in Robertson
Sauna, er, Stadium. '

Pitt’s Mad Dog Defense shined as six
Panthers seemed to be in on every tackle.
Houston’s running backs got their
yardage, but not their touchdowns.

Damell Dinkins, Jason Soboleski and
Chiffon Allen showed that the Panthers
can force a turnover when they need one
most. After the Cougars’ display of the
dropsies, it’s a marvel that Carl Lewis
managed to hold on to the relay baton at
halftime.

More importantly, they found a way
to win. Behind late in the fourth quarter,
Pitt recovered a fumble in the end zone at
the best possible moment. Then, with
Houston driving for the easy go—ahead
score, Allen stepped in front of a Tyson

THE PITT NEWS

Helton mistake and returned it for a
touchdown.

Pure, unadulterated, dumb luck?
Maybe. But that happens to good teams
sometimes.

If you caught Monday Night Football
this week, you understand. Barry Switzer
had all but shot himself (you know he
could have gotten the gun through Texas
Stadium security —— he’s an expert at that
kind of stuff) after seemingly giving the
game to the Philadelphia Eagles. Philly
lined up for a last-second gimrnie ﬁeld
goal, only to have holder Tommy Hutton
become an honorary Karamazov brother

_ at the worst possible moment.

Hutton tried to run the ball in after his
juggling incident, and was stopped. The
Cowboys won. Good luck happens to
good teams.

Strange as it may sound, Pitt is now a
good team. The Panthers have a 2-1
record, with their only .loss coming to the
nation’s best.

Pete Gonzalez, thumbing his nose at
every football expert on earth, has turned

' into a competent West Coast offense quar- ~

terback. Dwayne Schulters has become a
serviceable feature back, and Jake Hoffart
has become Dwight Clark, somehow.

Move to the other side of the ball, and
you find energy in Dinkins, youth in Jeff
McCurley and Calvin Robinson, experi-
ence in Frank Moore, and heart in John
Jenkins.

This is not the team that eked out a
one-point Homecoming victory against
Temple last year in a game where both
defenses took a sick day. This is not a
team that will give up more than 30 points
to teams outside the Associated Press’ top
10. .

This is not Johnny Majors’
Oldsmobile. It’s a new model, and it gets
its ﬁrst Big East driving test tomorrow.

Be there. Even if you don’t watch
football, be there. Come for the festivities,
come for the bands, come for the food —
a Homecoming festival that could only be
brought to you by Student Government,
since no other group is allowed to use the
allocations money for that kind of stuff.

Don’t be the only one in your dorm or
on your block to miss the start of Panther
Bowl Quest. It all happens tomorrow.

Oh, the sun willcome out

ORANGE

Coleman is one of the strongest play-
ers on the team and has settled in at
the other defensive—tackle position.

Jason Walters and Dulayne
Morgan return as ends for their
senior year. They have a lot of expe-
rience and will help anchor an other-
wise young and untested defensive
line.

Antwaune Ponds is the only
starting linebacker returning. Junior
Stan Gibbs is the next most experi-
enced linebacker. Kevin O’Neil and
Keith Bullock are converted safeties
who will provide some speed out-
side, but they keep the Orange small
and inexperienced.

r ,Anthony Walker returns at safety
but his partner Donovin Darius grad-
uated, opening up a big hole in the
defensive backfield. Converted tail-
back Tebucky Jones, Vernon Banks,
Shawn Summerville and Jamont
Kinds will all compete for the open
spot. ‘
