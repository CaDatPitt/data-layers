Recycling  

program
cleans up
its act  

Brett Taylor

News Asslstant

Five years ago Pitt's recycling
system was a mess.

Students and faculty would take
the time touse the proper recycling
bins, just to have it mixed with the
other garbage when it was picked
up. And Pitt had no full-time
employee to oversee the recycling
program.

This all changed, according to
Pitt's recycling coordinator Greg
Garvin.

Garvin took the positi-on in
early 1995, but Pitt didn’t contract
with its first real recycling compa-
ny, Browning Ferris Industries,
until June 1996.

Garvin attributes Pitt's poor
record of recycling to not working
with a true recycling company. At
the time of the problems, Pitt used
A. Phillips Hauling and All-Safe
Document Destruction.

"In Anthony Phillips’ defense,
though, he is not a recycling com-
pany, he's a waste hauler," Garvin

said.

No one from A. Phillips Hauling
was available for comment.

All-Safe Document Destruction
is a company dedicated to destroy-
ing confidential documents —- not
recycling.

In June 1996 Pitt contracted
with BFI for all Facilities
Management areas; these include
classrooms, offices and athletic
facilities but not dormitories.

Garvin said that in an effort to
improve the recycling situation
after taking over, he developed
strong lines of communications
with Pitt custodial workers to
ensure they report any sites around
campus that needed changes.

"I get out on campus every day,"
Garvin said. "But not to the extent

The recycling coordinator placed bins all over campus to help improve participation.

that they do. They know what goes
on day—in and day—out in the area
they work on."

One maintenance worker, who
declined to give his name, said that
even though the recycling system
seems to have improved since Pitt
contracted with BFI, the biggest
problem occurs when students and
faculty don't place recyclables and
garbage in the proper receptacles.

He said recycling/trash separa-
tion is especially bad at Benedum
Hall, where maintenance workers
must often separate the recyclable
materials. _

Garvin said this is the biggest
problem with the recycling process
is getting students involved.

United States

military strike against Iraq 

Across The Nation

WASHINGTON — Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said any
attack on Iraq will come in weeks. ‘

Albright says if the United
States decides to attack, it won't be
a "pinprick." She told CBS it will
be a sustained, substantial attack.

The secretary of state repeated
that Saddam Hussein holds his fate
in his hands. She said U. N.
weapons inspectors must be given
full access to the sites they want to
check. .

Albright said if the military
option is exercised, the United
States will have two goals -
knocking out Saddam's capacity to
produce weapons of mass destruc-
tion and diminishing his ability to
threaten his neighbors.

Appearing on the same pro-
gram, Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott said he agrees with Albright
that any attack should be aggressive
and sustained. But Lott said the
ultimate goal should be to remove
Saddam from power.

WASHINGTON —— President
Clinton spoke on the telephone with
the prime ministers of_ Canada and
the Netherlands. The topic of dis-
cussion: Iraq.

The president called‘ to talk
about the prospect of support for a
diplomatic or other solution to the
crisis with Iraq.

U. S. officials suggested that
Canadian Prime Minister Jean

.. Chretien would soon publicly indi-

cate soon "an interest in supporting
or participating" in a military
action, should it come to that.

Clinton, in earlier calls over the
weekend, consulted with the leaders
of Saudi Arabia and Australia.

LOS ANGELES — It's still smooth
sailing for Titanic, the movie.

Titanic is the top movie for the
eighth weekend in a row and is No.
4 on the all-time domestic money-
making list. It's made more than
$337 million so far.

And Titanic could receive
another boost if — as expected — it
receives a number of Academy
Award nominations this week.

NEW YORK — Were wedding
bells on the horizon for Princess
Diana and Dodi Fayed? The authors
of a new book about the princess
think so.

The_ two authors, both Time
magazine correspondents, claim the

October or November.

In their book — "Death of a

The authors also quote doctors

she'd been rushed right to an emer-

VULNERABILITY

When the keystroke—recording pro- 8

gram from computer-security websites

. is added to this key in the registry, it

starts up every time the PC is rebooted.
It then stores all the keystrokes, includ-
ing students’ usemames and passwords,

» into a file readable with any word
processor.

“This is just a problem with the

- way Pitt sets things up, but you could

even put viruses on the computer that
could do real damage,” said
Vranesevich.

The AntiOnline founders said they
decided to search Pitt’s computer sys-
tem for problems after CIS employee
Michael Spring was quoted in a The

_ Pitt News article as saying "a password

would not be as secure in the
Department of Defense."

. Spring now says he should have
qualified that statement.

He said that when a password is
sent-over the network, it’s encoded to
prevent anyone from stealing it. A pass-
word encoded by Pitt’s system, accord-
ing to Spring, is more secure than the
passwords at the Department of
Defense.

But, he admits, it is possible to
steal a password before it is encoded by
using a program that record passwords.
He added that students can also look
over your shoulder to get your pass-
word. ,

Spring said his first concern with
that type of program would be ﬁnding
it. “The question is: Would my operat-

, ing system detect that intrusion before

another student sat down?” he asked.
Vranesevich said he put a simula-
tion of the keystroke—recording pro-

gram on a Windows NT machine last

Thursday. When he checked it 36 hours _

later, it was still there.

He said he was able to install the ‘

program in 18 seconds, making it easy
to move among computers and affect
several in just a few minutes.

Someone could also set up the
computer to e—mail the passwords to
another account, ‘so that the hacker
wouldn’t have to return to the lab com-
puter, according to Vranesevich.

“I think it’s unethical to report this
[publicly]. That’s all I have to say about
the matter,” Linder said. He refused
further comment.

Vranesevich said he feels he’s done
nothing unethical in reporting the prob-
lem publicly.

“Users in a lab environment should
know there are inherent security risks
with using lab computers,” he said.
“Also, this might force Pitt to fix this as
soon as possible.”

Vranesevich said Loft, another
computer security group, found a major
problem with Windows NT and noti-
ﬁed Microsoft. But four months later
they still had not ﬁxed the problem, he
said. , A

When Loft went to the press,
Microsoft found a solution within one
week.

Spring said he sees no problem
with Vranesevich telling the public
about the ﬂaw, because he’s offering a.
solution — restrict access to Windows
NT settings where the keystroke-
recording program can be placed.

“If you know how to close the
door,” he said, “you should yell it from
the roof.”

"It's all about safety. We
learned our lesson," he continued in
the interview. "A very sad thing
happened. Maybe we need to build
a new one." .

Stanley said other Pitt players
also hit the wall at practices.

He declined to comment further
on the safety of the Cost Center or

1 his lawsuit.

Eugene Giotto, the attorney
representing Pitt and the coaches,
also declined to comment on the
suit. _

Majors redshirted Stanley his
freshman year, the 1995-96 acade-
mic year, which means that Stanley
was allowed to practice with the

team but could not play during the

season. Consequently, he never
played a game at Pitt.

He Said

RECYLCLING

to the students’ attention, Garvin
said he placed the trios of blue and
brown recycling bins strategically
around campus. He also personally
placed the color—coded labels on the
bins; however students and faculty
still don't recycle as often as they
could.

Garvin said that if everyone

-recycled more efficiently, Pitt

would save a lot of money on trash
hauling.

"The more we recycle, the less
we pay in waste removal, and the
more we save," Garvin said. "The
incentive is there to recycle more."

Although he declined to say

how much Pitt saves on waste‘

 

FROM PAGE 1

removal by recycling,‘ Garvin did
say the University pays $226 a
month to pick up recyclables at all

Facilities Management. buildings.

This is a small amount compared to
the $10,000 Pitt pays each month
for regular waste removal.

Jim Gajewski, district vice pres-
ident of recycling processes at BFI,
said BFI charges Pitt a low monthly
rate because Pitt provides a large
volume of -material on a consistent
basis andbecause BFI wants to help
the University.

He said that because Pitt pro-
vides so much paper, BFI can sort it
by grades: recycling what is most
profitable, and discarding what is

not.

“They sort the paper and often.)
store the grades that aren't paying a _.
lot in big bundles — until the price ‘-

comes up," Garvin said.

Recycled products are picked up:

twice a week at Pitt. The custodial

workers collect the products from‘
the bins around the campus and;
transport them to larger ones at thef

loading docks where they are

picked up by BFI.

With the exception of the occa—?

sional incident of a custodial work-

er mixing recyclable materials with:
garbage, Garvin said he sees no?
major problems in the recycling;

program.

"We definitely don't have any
mixing from the company," he said. .1
"If we did, the company would be;

gone."

Garvin added that Facilities
Management worked hard to break
Pitt's poor recycling efforts from
five years ago, and brought unex-
pected benefits with the change.

"Recycling saves a lot of money
if it's done right," Garvin said. I

Student deserves
recognition for 9  

service to Universily

' Last week Pitt announced this year’s winners of the
I Chancellor’s Distinguished Teaching, Research and
_ Public Service awards for faculty who excel in one of

‘~ these areas.

Perhaps it’s time for Pitt to create Chancellor’s
' Distinguished awards for students, and this newspaper

__.‘ has a recommendation for the first public service award
L. recipient: John Vranesevich. ‘

That’s right. The same person who faced a

‘ University judicial board after CIS ofﬁcials pulled the.

'1‘ plug on his computer privileges last semester because
; his web page was attracting too many visitors and bur-

dening the PittNet system.’ —

Last week, this 19-year-old freshman found a secu-

.j‘ rity glitch in the University’s computing system that
— would allow people to steal other users’ passwords. He
 reported the ﬁnding to Computing and Information

{ Services, and then told The Pitt News so that people

.. who use the system would be aware of the loophole.
' Hopefully, in doing so, he gave CIS some extra initia-
 tive to correct the problem as soon as possible.

But this contribution to Pitt is just one of many pub-
lic service projectspwith which Vranesevich is involved.
He founded AntiOnline, a web page dedicated to

9 posting security glitches in computer networks to help

system administrators protect their networks from

T: hackers. The web page is a noncommercial, nonproﬁt
 service dedicated to the ﬁght against computer hacking.

Inscmitynot an excuse for criminals

Carrie Hager

Columnlst

We are all accountable for
what we do, and need to take
responsibility for everything we
do, whether we meant to do it or
not.

Take murder, for instance. A‘

murder is a murder whether it
was premeditated, a spur-of—the-
moment thing, or whether the
person says he just “blacked
out.” It makes no difference. In
any case, a human life has been
taken, and justice needs to be
served. Just because someone is,
or claims to be, a delusional psy-
chotic maniac shouldn’t change
his punishment.

-The insanity plea gained
nationwide attention when John
Hinkley Jr. attempted, and
almost succeeded, in assassinat-
ing Ronald Reagan. It was sup-
posed. to be an open-and-shut
case. It seemed obvious that
someone who attempted to kill
the president should be punished
severely. But jurors in the case
shocked the nation when they

‘found Hinkley to be not guilty by
reason of insanity.

Not guilty? The man almost
killed the president. His mental
status should not have been the
issue. Only the crime should
have been the issue.

I’m not saying that some or
even many defendants aren’t and
shouldn’t be found insane. I just
thinkeven if a person is insane
he is just as guilty. Many say that
the insane criminal can be better
reformed in a , mental hospital,
but that is ridiculous. Just

because someone is insane or
claims to be doesn’t mean he
should be punished less. If it is
needed, mental counseling ’ can
always be provided in jail.

Some argue that serial killers
are insane and aren’t accountable
for what they do. Obviously, any
person who commits multiple
murders, often torturing and
sometimes eating or keeping the
remains of their victims, has
some serious issues. But that
makes no difference. He is still
just as guilty and should be just
as accountable for his actions

Defense lawyers sometimes
use the insanity plea because
they know it is the only possible
way they can get their guilty
client off. (I often wonder how
defenders of Dahmer, Berkowitz
and Gacy can sleep at night,
knowing the monsters they tried
to defend.)

It shouldn’t be like that.
Everyone is responsible for his
actions, regardless of "his mental
state. Saying someone is less
guilty because he is insane is

almost like saying it’s okay that

you killed that innocent victim;
we can forget about justice and
just send you to a nice low-secu-
rity mental hospital for a couple
months. If you tell someone he

isn’t accountable for his actions, '

he will never take responsibility
for what he did, and may kill
again since he can just say that it
wasn’t his fault, he just “blacked
out.” p ..
Susan Biancardi was con-
victed of murdering her teenage
daughter. She shot her daughter
in the "head . while the girl was

THE PITT NEWS

asleep. This is obviously a hor-
rendous crime, and it seemed

’ justice had been served when she
was found guilty of murder. That
was until recently when the U.S.
Supreme Court ordered her a
new trial because it said the jury
didn’t.consider the “not guilty by
reason of insanity” option thor-
oughly.

That is absurd. She obvious-
ly has something wrong with her
if she would shoot‘ her own
daughter, but that doesn’t change
what she did and shouldn’t make
her any less accountable.

If the insanity plea works in
such horriﬁc cases of murder,
how else can it be used? Should
I be able to say that Ididn.’ t do
my homework or'I screamed at
my boss by reason of insanity?
‘Using the insanity plea as a
defense is just ludicrous. The
insanity plea allows for extreme-
ly sick individuals to get off eas-
ily, sometimes not going to. trial
at all.

Many teen mothers who hide
their pregnancy, then kill their
newborns, get, a reduced sen-

tence or no sentence at all,

because they are found to be

- insane at the time the crime was
committed. Many of these‘ mon-
sters are released back into soci-
ety with little more than a slap on
the wrist. ‘ '

The insanity plea should be,

abolished altogether. Criminals
need to be held accountable for
their actions.

Carrie Hager thinks our society
makes too many excuses instead
of ﬁxing the problems.

 Labs to crack its commercial encryption scheme called
. RC564. If successful, AntiOnline will receive a $5000

 who have donated their time and energy for the better-
T, ment of both this university and the outside world (in
A" Vranesevich’s case, the growing electronic village that
.. is becoming the backbone of communication for our

0 After all the news stories in past years of hackers

People today, those who think about God

at all, often go to one of two extremes:
either they are caught up in exclusively
rational arguments and logical proofs for

or against the existence of God, or their
approach to God is exclusively emotional,
even anti-intellectual. John Henry Newman
(1801-1890), distinguished man of letters '
and saintly leader in .the Anglican and

then Catholic churches, proposes a helpful
solution that calls the whole person, mind
and heart, into thoughtful communion with
the God of Jesus Christ.

Iympic gold?

The NHL began it’s two—and-a-half-,
week hiatus on Sunday, sending its super-
stars to Nagano and sending the rest on
vacation.

For the first time ever, the NHL has
sent professional players to play for their
respective nations and compete for the
coveted Olympic gold medal.

Unlike the American-dorninated
NBA, the NI-IL’s players are spread out
all over the globe, giving about eight dif-
ferent nations a legitimate shot at a medal.
The players aren’t even staying at a lavish
hotel like the NBA Dream Team boys —
they are staying in the athlete dorms with
all of the other Olympic stars.

In the past, Olympic hockey has been
dominated by the Canadian and Russian
(Soviet) squads, but this time around, the
U.S.A. is one of the most heavily favored
countries to take the gold medal, just like
they did in the 1996 World Cup and in the
1980 Olympic games at Lake Placid, N.Y.

But, with the NHL players competing
seriously against their professional team-
mates, what risks are they willing to take

I to win?

Let’s say, for instance, that Eric
Lindros and Team Canada are in an over-
time battle with the United States for a
medal. John LeClair of Team USA takes
a cross-ice pass deep into the Canadian
zone.

Instantly, Lindros is on him. He has
two options:

A) He could drill LeClair into next
week,-preventing a possible goal and risk-
ing injuiy to a fellow Flyer teammate, and
possibly kissing Lord Stanley’s Cup
goodbye; or,

B) He could let him slide, thus risk-

. ing a possible goal, an Olympic medal

and being labeled the national goat of
Canada.

What would Lindros do?

I wonder if Darius Kasparaitis of
Team Russia will take out Jaromir Jagr’s
(Team Czech Republic) legs if the two
squads meet.

These situations are very possible,
especially with so many players repre-
senting different countries and with the
extremely high level of physical play

A needed to take home a medal.

No doubt, this Olympic hockey tour-

. nament will be the most exciting and

competitive it has been in years.
But if a premiere player is hurt badly,
the injury could hurt more than just the

medal hopes of his country. After all, the

Pitt snaps six-game losing streak

Men's hoops drops City Game, recovers to blow out BC

awkrns slas home tw of his 1 points

Ned Schano

Senlor Staff Writer

Keep shooting.

That’s exactly what Pitt basket-
ball Panther Jarrett Lockhart’s team-
matestoldhimtodointheﬁrsthalfof
yesterday’s 89-79 victory over Boston
College.

. The sophomore shooting guard
did just that, scoring 21 of his career-
liigh 25 points in the ﬁrst half, helping
the Panthers break a discouraging six-
game losing streak.

Lockhart exploded out of the
gates yesterday, scoring Pitt’s ﬁrst 10
points of the game by way of two
three-pointers, a pull-up jumper and a
driving layup oﬁ" a steal by Vonteego
Cummings.

Pitt Head Coach Ralph Willard
atlributed Lockhart’s hot start to the
guard being well rested after the
Panthers ﬁnished a three-garne in ﬁve-
days stretch. . .

“Everyone knows that if Jarrett
has fresh legs he can shoot the basket-
ball,” Willard said “I think his team-

mates sensed that today.”

Lockhart has been the team’s
hottest shooter, leading the Panthers in
scoring for the last three games. His
recent 22- and 19-point performances,
however, ended in losses to West
Virginia and Duquesne. Lockhart said
he was particularly frustrated after the
80-69 loss to Duquesne on Thursday.

“I was upset after the Duquesne
game,” Lockhart said “I felt I didn’t
play hard enough on the defensive
end. But I wanted to come out today
and play as hard as I can.”

Pitt wore down the Eagles in the
ﬁrst half by rotating players off the

bench. VVith Kellii Taylor out indeﬁ- v

nitely with pain in his left foot, Willard
received positive minutes from fresh-
men Kevin Leslie and Stephen Flores.
' In addition to Lockhart’s career
night, sophomore center Isaac
Hawkins had his fourth double-dou-
ble of the year, scoring 19 points while
adding 11 rebounds. -
Hawkins has been working on a

Hlede, Higgins serve Lady
Panthers two straight losses

The Lady Panther hoops
squad had a simple game plan
going into Thursday’s City Game
versus the Duquesne Lady Dukes:

Stop Korie I-llede.

Or, more accurately, slow
down Korie Hlede; '

Pitt diagrarned against her.
Panther guards Michelle
Katkowski and Gina Montesano
took turns playing against her,
knocking her to the ﬂoor on more
than one occasion. The team’s total
concentration was on the star guard
Duquesne’s other players “were
pretty much nonexistent,” accord-
ing to Pitt Head Coach Kirk Bruce.

But Hlede, getting little support
from teammates, pumped -in 36
points to give the Lady Dukes a 68-
62 victory and give the Lady
Panthers their ninth straight loss. '

A 10th loss came soon after, as

the Panthers (4-18) ﬁnished off a
four-garne, eight-day stretch with a
48-42 loss to the Villanova
Wildcats.

“I think we’ve played pretty
well ‘over these last .two games,”
Bruce said, “and I know these ladies
are tired” ,

Pitt did not look tired in the ﬁrst
half of the ﬁrst game, overcoming
I-Ilede’s 16 ﬁrst-half points and tak-
ing a 33-26 lead into the break.

The halftime break, as always,
lasted 15 minutes. But this time,
someone forgot to tell both offenses
— neither team scored until
Duquesne’s Kelly Eberhandt made
a free throw at the 16:38 mark.

Pitt’s oﬂ°ense hibemated even
longer. Duquesne went on an 11-0
run to open the half, with six of its
points coming from I-llede. The star
guard had two breakaway lay-ins
during the 11111 — good for four
points — and would have had a

l.ockhart's career-high 25 helps
Pitt men break losing streak

Eric Mosley
Staff Wrlter

Jarrett Lockhart just wanted to make
up for Pitt’s loss to Duquesne on
Thursday night. He just wanted to take
out his aggressions on Boston College
and set a tone for the game.

But the tone was not the only thing
Lockhart set on Sunday. Lockhart
scored 21 points in the first half, en route
to setting his own personal career high
of 25 points.

“I took this game as a personal chal-
lenge,’’ Lockhart said. “When one of us
gets hot, we try to get them the ball. I
was that man today'.”

“He just came out on ﬁre,” team-
mate Isaac Hawkins said following Pitt’s
89-79 win over BC.

“Jarrett came out with better legs
today and gave us a good start,” Pitt
Head Coach Ralph Willard said.
‘_‘Everybody knows he can really shoot
the basketball, and his teammates sensed
it today.”

Lockhart got the Panthers off to a
fast stait, hitting back—to—back three-
pointers and then back—to—back ﬁeld

 

 

  

Lockhart has quietly emerged as one
of the most dangerous three—point shoot-
ers in the Big East.'He is tied for first
among Big East players with an average
of 2.7 three-pointers in conference play.

He led the Panthers in scoring
through Pitt’s last three games, scoring

22 pointsagainst West Virginia, a ga.me- ,

high 19 against Duquesne and yester-
day’s 25.

“I feel very comfortable with my
shot right now,” Lockhart said. “I just

stuck my nose in there today. I’m trying -

to play hard on both ends of the ﬂoor.”
After defensive adjustments by the

Eagles-, Lockhart hit only one ﬁeld goal ' '

in the second half.

He may not have scored many
points, but Lockhart provided the lead-
ership needed by this young Panther
squad by grabbing loose balls and mak-
ing quick steals that led to Panther
points. ‘

At the 12:10 mark of the second
half, Lockhart picked up his fourth per-
sonal foul. While he was on the bench,

BC slashed Pitt’s 29-point advantage to .

only 11 points.

but her foul shots were deadlier,
as she made all eight attempts.

“Korie battled_ away,” said
Duquesne Head Coach Dan
Durkin. “It wasn’t necessarily her
greatest performance, but she
came out with those 36 points and
she played hard, especially in the
defensive battles.” ’

But Hlede made it look so
easy- -

Gina Montesano couldn’t stop
her, nor could Michelle
Katkowski. Pitt’s futile attempts
to halt the star point guard were
epitomized in two plays.

Midway through the first half,
Montesano went to block Hlede
on a two-on-one fast break but
fell backwards, hitting her head
on the base of the basketball

hoop.
In the final minute of the
game, Katkowski leaped - and

blocked Hlede’s initial shot, send-
ing Hlede to the ﬂoor.

However, the point guard
made up“ for lost effort by sinking
two free throws to extend the
Dukes’ lead to 5_8-53.

“They had 25 [Katkowski] and

The same play was carbon-
copied for Kelly Eberhardt, who
was Duquesne’s second leading
scorer Thursday night but who
scored only 13 in the win.

Duquesne feels lucky to have
such a player as Hlede; the roster
behind her is thin, save for Gina
N accarato and Eberhardt.

"“She’s a great qne, but [there
is also] Nykeshia .Sales
[University of Connecticut] in the
Big East,” said Bruce. “Nykeshia

might have the better supporting..-

cast, but Korie Hlede ranks right
up there with her in ability.”

And as far ‘as winning that
national scoring title?

“I’d love to,” Hlede said after
the game. ,“But right now all I
want to do isewin. If I win the title
but my team doesn’t win, it’s
great. If I don’t win the title and
we win, then it’s even more awe-

Maglos and 6-foot-9 Mickey Curley.

After Lockhart’s ﬁrst 10 points and

Hawkins’ ﬁrst baby hook, Pitt held a _

commanding 12-2 lead three and a half

. minutes into the game.

BC came back with two Oirley lay-
ins and a Granger dunk. But after
Lockhart hit his fourth three-pointer of
the half, Pitt pushed its lead to 25-12.

The Eagles tried to shake the
Panthers by using a 1-3-1 trap defense

with nine minutes left in the half. That led
to a series of uncontested baskets by the
Panthers, who broke the trap with a one-
handed dunk by Cummings and a Ricky
Greer put—back dunk off a Lockhart miss
at 6:27.

Pittledby asmany as 25 pointsinthe

ﬁrst half before settling for a 49-26 ha]f- .

time lead.

BC showed in the second half the ﬁre
that it lacked in the ﬁrst 20 minutes by
going on a 30-10 run early in the period.

Maglos, who scored 16 of his team-
high 17 points in the second half, led the
Eagles’ run. He highlighted his perfor-

mance by dunking an alley-oop pass from
Javier Rodriguez with eight minutes left

After BC’s leading scorer, Antonio
Granger, hit a layup to cut the Panther
lead to nine at 68-59, the Eagles looked
like they may make the game interesting
down the stretch.

Witll Lockhart on the bench with

four fouls, Pitt’s inside players took over.
Pitt put the game out of reach with an
emphatic put—back jam by Hawkins off a

third if Pitt’s Kortni Webb hadn’t stopped
it by nearly knocking her to the ﬂoor.

Hlede made the ensuing free throws.
Almost a minute later, Pitt would ﬁnally
answer with a Farrah Woods layup.

“If there was no such thing as‘ half-
time, we would have done pretty well,”
Montesano said. The Pitt guard had 11
points in the ﬁrst frame, but managed just
three in the second half.

Hlede, on the other hand, added 20
points in the second, including eight from
the free-throw line. Pitt, as a team, also had
eight points from the line in the second
half.

With Duquesne up 56-53 late in the
second, the Panthers took control of the
contest. Pitt’s LaTonya Blanton drove

foul. She went to the line and missed both
free throws.

Pitt regained possession, and Nickeia
Morris drove the lane and attempted a lay-
in, only to be hammered by Lady Duke
Maja Kauzlaric. She went to the line and
also missed both free throws.

Instead of a having one—point lead,

the Lady Panthers had controlled the pace .

of the contest for nearly two minutes with-
out scoring a point.

“We had to make a run right there,”
Bruce said, “and we just kind of hung
aroun .”

Hlede ﬁnally got the ball back for the
Lady‘ Dukes, and would have scored on a
layup if Katkowski hadn’t nearly tackled
her.

In what would be Katkowski’s fourth
foul of the night, the 5-foot—6 guard
attempted to block the layup, but missed

She then swung I-Ilede around, plant-

ing her on the ground with a loud thud,
followed by a loud referee’s whistle and
an even louder cheer from the Pitt fans in
attendance.

The foul was also followed by two
Hlede free throws, giving Duquesne a
ﬁve-point lead. The Panthers would not
challenge again.

“The ball was in [I-llede’s] hand a lot,
and she had to do what she had to do,”
Bruce said

At Vrllanova on Saturday, the
Panthers faced another one-woman show.
This time, Wildcat guard Jenny Higgins
scored 20 points to lead her squad to a six-

NHL playoff run typically gets ﬁred up around
the beginning of March.

The nations with the best chance of bringing
home more than just a free T-shirt from Nagano
are the U.S.A., Canada, Finland, Sweden, the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia and Germany.

Team USA boasts players like Mike
Modano, LeClair and Keith Tkachuk. Team
Canada has the best all—around goaltending corps
"with Patrick Roy, Martin Brodeur and CuJo
(Curtis Joseph). The sleeper squad will be team
Sweden, with Peter Forsberg on offense and
arguably one of the best defenseman in the world
— Nicklas Lidstrom. Forsberg and Lidstrom are
NI-IL rivals with Colorado and Detroit, respec-
tively,but are now teaming up for a medal.

The style of play should be more open, with
a much larger ice surface allowing more oﬁense
to be generated. NHL ice surfaces are 200 feet
long and 85 feet wide; Olympic dimensions are

just as long, but 14 feet wider — defensemen
will have much more ice to cover which will
reduce the chance for an open-ice hit or any neu-
t:ral—zone-trap style of defense like the one mas-
tered by the New Jersey Devils.

There will be a lack of glove-dropping, as
brawling on the ice of an Olympic game will
‘result in an immediate ejection. But very rough
styles of play should be expected from the
U.S.A. and Canada, two squads that may face oil“
in the gold-medal round. ,

Just don’t expect any hard hits from NHL
teammates.
