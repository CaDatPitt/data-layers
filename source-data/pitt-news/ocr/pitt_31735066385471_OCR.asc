Germans
form waste
agreement

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

The Center for Hazardous
Materials Research at Pitt has
signed a cooperation agreement
with a West German
environmental institute, opening
the door for joint ventures and
research for both countries in
the future.

Edgar Berkey, president. of
CHMR, said that this new pact
will initiate many conferences to
discuss environmental problems.

“We can now talk about such
problems as acid — rain and
cleaning up old industrial sites,”
he said. Among other things that
Berkey said would be discussed
are new techniques for
preventing pollution and
minimizing hazardous waste.

The agreement was reached
with the West German Institute
for Industrial Waste and Waste
Management, located in the
German state of Saarland.
Saarland is a heavily
industrialized area located in
southwestern West Germany,
close to the French border. Once
a major steel and coal region, it
has undergone a transformation
to use more applied science and
higher technology, much the
same as the Pittsburgh area has.
This agreement adds to

The '0'
to begin
delivery
service

By Chantal Evans
Staff Writer

The Original Hot Dog Shop, a
longtime favorite of Pitt students,
will soon‘ be offering delivery
service in the Oakland area.

According to Terry Harrigan, a
manager at the “O,” it is not
certain when delivery will start.
“We’re not really sure of the exact
date, but delivery will probably
begin when the weather clears,”
she said.

There will be a $6 minimum for
delivery and no actual delivery
charge.

Harrigan said that years ago the
“O” did deliver, mainly to college
students on campus. She said
that they have been trying to get
the delivery process re-installed
for a while.

Harrigan mentioned fries, pizza
and hot dogs among the eligible
items for delivery.

“We will not deliver any
alcoholic beverages," she said.

Delivery will only be in the
Oakland area. Harrigan said that
delivering again will definitely
increase business at the “O,” but
that is not the main purpose for
the new policy.

“The idea was mainly inspired
by working people who could
not get away from their place of
work to order at the “O,”she said.

“Everyone wants us to deliver,”

Capitalists beneﬁt from voyage behind the Iron Curtain

Byjennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

After spending 13 days in the
Soviet Union, Pitt students Kristen
Zagst and Nathan Urban say that
they have gotten used to being
referred to as “the capitalists."

“One night we had dinner in
the home of a Lithuanian family.
They were fairly poor and lived
in a very small apartment We ate
what was probably the best meal
that they have had in a long time,
and the whole night they kept
calling us capitalists,” said Zagst,
who is a sophomore in Pitt's
Honors College and is majoring
in behavioral neuroscience and
chemistry.

Zagst and Urban were among
50 students chosen from hundreds
of applicants to participate in the
“American-Soviet Student
Leadership Seminar,” which was
held at the University of Vilnius
in Lithuania and at universities in
Leningrad and Moscow from Dec.
29 to Jan. 11. They were the only
students chosen from
Pennsylvania.

“I really don’t know why it is
that we were chosen, but I do
think that they were looking for
sincerity in the applications, and
people who really wanted to get
something out of it," Zagst said.

Urban, who is a junior in the
Honors College and is majoring
in behavioral neuroscience,
mathematics and philosophy, said
that the recent events in Lithuania
and a desire to explore the Soviet
Union were what first drove him
to apply for the program.

“I think that this was a great
opportunity to see things up close

and to really experience things
firsthand," Urban said.
The program focused on
discussions and exchanges

CHMR:‘—

which it is working. During
October's Chautauqua
conference, the organization
signed a similar agreement with
the Soviets. CHMR also has a
working relationship with the

Dutch.

.“People are interested in
cleaning up the environment,"
Berkey said

CHMR is a branch of Pitt that
provides technical assistance to
businesses and industries. It is
also involved in what Berkey
called ‘chemical fete studies,"
which are studies to determine
what happens to certain
chemicals, such as pesticides,
when they are introduced into
the atmosphere. CHMR provides
education and training for those
people aspiring in careers in waste
management and disposal.

A German delegation, including
the Saarland’s cultural minister
and the president of the University
of the Saarland, will be coming to
Pitt to visit with President Wesley
Posvar sometime later this month.

“West Germany has a strong
environmental movement with
high expectations,” Berkey said.
“This agreement provides a strong
foundation for greatly expanded
cooperation between CHMR and
an important region of the world. ”

between the American and Soviet

students.

“Things there are a lot different
for students. They have to attend
classes for an average of 36 hours
a week, and they attend the
university for five years. It seems
like a lot of things and classes are
chosen for them," Zagst said.

“If they go to the university to
become a doctor, then that is all
that they learn about. There is no
liberal education like we have
here; they are expected to learn
those sorts of things in high
school.”

Urban said that some of the
students he spoke to were
unhappy with the policies at the
universities they were attending.

“There are courses like scientiﬁc
atheism that they are forced to
take, and they are trying to change

that,” Urban said.
Urban said that he was surprised
at the opinions that the Soviet

students had about Premier

Mikhail Gorbachev.

“They seemed to think that he
was someone who talked a lot,
but who didn't really do anything.
I guess that is because the
Gorbachev that we see involves
foreign affairs and what they
measure him by is the economy,”
he said.

Zagst said the economy in the
Soviet Union seemed even worse
than what she had imagined.

“Most of the products there
reminded us of 1950. There were
people waiting in line for light
bulbs and socks and shoes,” Zagst
said.

Zagst said that the strong sense
of nationalism in Lithuania also

surprised her.

“They hardly spoke Russian
and mostly spoke Lithuanian.
They had a very strong sense of
their heritage and certainly knew
a lot more about their history
than most Americans do about
their own," Zagst said.

Zagst said that the Soviets hold
many misconceptions about
American life.

“They [think] we [have]
everything, and we don’t have
any problems. They don’t realize
how bad things are in some parts
here,” she said.

._ Zagst’s and Urban’s trip cost
$2,500 each and was paid for by
the University Honors College.
While in the Soviet Union, they

also found time to sightsee and
socialize with the Soviet students.
“We played basketball, and

we even got to watch some Soviet

TV," Zagst said.

Both Zagst and Urban said that
the experience taught them a lot
about the Soviet Union and the
United States.

“What it taught me was how
important my freedom here is
and how lucky I am," Zagst said.

“I now have so much of a
better understanding of the
makeup of the Soviet Union. It is
made up of 1 5 very distinct groups
ethnically and culturally. I don’t
think that many people
understand how different all the
people there are,” Urban said.

Shanty

Continued from page I

“I know what it is to be
homeless. I know that hurt. I
know that fear. I know what
that's like,” said Brown, who
still struggles to support himself,
receiving food stamps to survive.

“Living on the street, two
things happen to you: you get
physically down and you get
mentally down. You become
depressed," Brown said. “You
become segregated from the
entire world.”

The Pittsburgh Urban League
Housing Director, Jim Frazier,
who has been working with the
homeless for the past 21 years,
helps coordinate Pittsburgh
Housing Now!. Standing near
the shanty, Frazier warned that
college students today will pay

for society's neglect of the
homeless with future tax
increases and social problems.
“The [Allegheny] county
spends millions on foster care
[of homeless childrenl,” said
Frazier. “They’re paying for it
but just the wrong way.”
Frazier advocates a federal
restoral of the housing funds cut
in 1981, so that affordable,
permanent housing can be made
available to lower income and
single parent families.

"Half of the population really
cannot afford" to live here,”
Frazier said. “I hope that the
students see that this is a very
important social issue that is
going to effect them in the
future.”

_Harrigan added. “We will
probably deliver to the hospital,
also."

Tanyia Harrison, a Pitt
sophomore, said, “Because the
prices at the “O” are going up, it
really isn’t hard to spend $6. On
the weekends, when my friends
and I eat at the Original, we tend
to hesitate because of the large
crowds that are always there.

Now that they’ve decided to add
a delivery service, we will
probably abandon the cafeteria
and order out all the time.”

Another student, Valarry Baker,
said that the new delivery policy
sounds reasonable. “If you order
pizza, you’re going to spend
around $6 anyhow. The “O” has
a larger selectionthan most places.
I’ll probably start ordering there a
lot.”

University chemists take explosive act on the road

By Mike Hudson
Staff Writer

Using chemically activated
explosions to ignite imaginations
and incite the intellect of potential
future scientists, members of
University of Pittsburgh's
chemistry department, led by the
seemingly magical Professor
Henry Bent, will soon be taking
their sorcery on the road.

Through the unofﬁcially named
outreach program referred to as
“The Van Project,” Bent, along
with chemistry graduate students,

will visit area schools in a
specially equipped chemistry van
to perform a variety of
pyrotechnic experiments.

Bent’s enthusiasm for the
experiments he and his
colleagues perform for the
students can only be matched by
the spectacular chemical
reactions that result from the
experiments.

His tricks include dropping a
piece of candy into molten
potassium chlorate to
demonstrate the volatile reaction
of converting energy, using a

alcohol and water to show how
the gaseous vapors burn and do
not damage the bill.

The focus of the program,
according to Bent, is to generate
an interest in chemistry and other
science- oriented ﬁelds.

“With my exhibition, I promise
the young students something
for the eyes, the ears and the
mind,” Bent said. “I want the.

students to see that science can
be fun.” A

The van used by Bent was
purchased by the chemistry
department with donations from
the Society for Analytical
Chemists of Pittsburgh, the
Spectroscopy Society of
Pittsburgh, Hewlett—Packard Co.
and Cochran Pontiac.

Through their joint
sponsorship, the groups hope
that Bent’s demonstrations will

9 encourage high school students
to become involved in science-

related°ﬁelds of study.

“Professor Bent has a great
talent for presenting his
experiments so that students ﬁnd
them interesting. We are hoping
to attract students through the
program," said Mary Louise
Theodore, a spokeswoman for
the Society forAnalytical Chemists
of Pittsburgh.

“My goal is to create enthusiasm
for science. We recognize the

great need to attract enthusiastic -

people into science ﬁelds for the
future," said Bent :

  “”f“”0’”“bl9 M991 53’“9m Somber pretext to demented friend I 

The Pennsylvania Legislature recently passed a bill that requires
Pennsylvania ‘retailers to label albums and tapes which contain
“offensive” lyrics.

In this particular situation, censorship would imply that the
legislature is attempting to prohibit artists from recording materi-
als that they may feel are too repulsive 't-:) be released. This is not
necessarily the aim of this particular legislation. ‘

It would be quite logical for the Pennsylvania Legislature to
insist that “offensive” albums and tapes be labeled as such by the
record manufacturers -— indeed, some materials are rather

offensive. However, this particular bill ‘ places the burden of
labeling the materials on the retailers, not the manufacturers.‘ .

Thus, the legislature is telling the retailers that they are at blame
for any offensive materials that are sold and not labeled as such.
This is an unnecessary burden on the retailers that could result

5 in litigation toward them. Under this bill, retailers would no
‘longer simply be in the business of selling albums and tapes, but

instead would assume the responsibilities of moralists, deciding
what society should or should not perceive as offensive. And
‘surely, if the retailers’ standards of what is or is not offensive are
not acceptable to the Pennsylvania Legislature, a reprimand and
possible legal action might be taken against them.

Enactrnent of this bill would mean that every retailer of every
store must listen to every song on every record or tape arid decide
whether the material on that record or tape warrants a warning
sticker. 7 t

It defies logic to place this responsibility upon the retailers of
this state.

The Pennsylvania Senate will take up the bill on Jan. 22.

Second-half surge brings
hope for '90 Steeler squad

On Jan. 7 the Pittsburgh Steelers ended a fabulous football
season with a gut-wrenching 24-23 loss to the Denver Broncos.
But despite the loss, the Steelers ended the 1989 football season
with one of the most dramatic and encouraging finishes in the
history of the team franchise. V

The team played a great game against the Broncos and probably

I should’ve won (or at least they played well enough to deserve to

win). Those same Broncos overwhelmed the Cleveland Browns
on Sunday, proving that the Steelers’ near-win against them wasn’t
merely a result of a postseason decline by the Broncos. Neverthe-
less, who would've ever expected this team, which lost its two
opening games by a total of 92 to 10, to go to the playoffs?
Great credit must be given to Coach -Chuck Noll and the entire
Steelers coaching staff, especially defensive coordinator Rod Rust,
offensive coordinator T or_n Moore and a remarkable special-teams
turnaround by Coach George Stewart. Noll silenced his critics this
year by playing, once again, brutal, basic football. The year-end
team statistics are definitely deceiving. This Steeler team has

g proven itself a future force to be reckoned with.

Once again that old proverb “just wait until next year” seems
perfectly apt and perhaps even tiresome. However, this is a very
young football team which does have great potential. The average
team experience is approximately three years.

The 1990 season will prove that the 1989 Steelers weren’t just
a “Cinderella” team, which, despite the old cliche, prompts us to
confidently say, “Just wait until next year.”

”Can I stay for the second half [of
Monday Night Foothalll?” - Former
Pitt student, to his neighbor

Dear Departed Friend,

In the daylight hours — like at
seven A.M. on days my first class
wasn’t until noon— you were there.
In the hours of darkness — like at
three in the morning on the rare

occasions ‘that I was sound asleep

—— you were there. Now, you have

i left; but it has occured to me that

you will always be here.

It was as if you were the dorm’s

figurative pair of polyester socks:

always in the corner drawer (room
1514), but - never the source of
anticipated contact or acceptance.

You were always in the halls. Al-
ways banging on doors. Always

eager to watch our televisions.

Always eager to engage in sense-
less banter. Always eager to borrow
our quarters.

When we had headaches, your
high-pitched laughter was a sure
aggravation. When we needed to
study, you would always prevent us
from doing so. When we left our
doors unlocked, you would never
fail to open them and come inside.
When we were sneaking out of our

cubicles to go somewhere, you

would always manage to stop us
and ask if you could come.

It was unfair that you were on our
ﬂoor — that you were on my floor.
Living next door to you seemed
tantamount to shacking up at a half-
way house. As my fresh memory of
four weeks recalls, you were one of
the most mixed-up people I had
ever met. My, how you were a
character — but certainly not a
character that Bogey would play.

We all secretly wished for your
final curtain call, and just before
Christmas you complied.
You told me that you were
leaving because you needed “a
change of pace.” I believe you
mentioned taking a semester off,
and thentransferring to a school
“somewhere in New England.” I
would very much like to believe
that all of this is true, but my gut
instinct tells me differently.
Something tells me that you
weren’t very happy here; that
we didn’t treat you with a very
human understanding.
Maybe you were tired of hav-
ing us slam doors in your face all

 

of the time. Maybe you were
tired of having‘ your name ap-
pear in bathroom stalls and in
elevators as the target of filthy
ridicule. Maybe you were tired
of the resident director's sum-

, moning of the ﬂoor to discuss

you and our treatment of you; an
affirmation of our pranks. Maybe
you were tired of us slipping
perfumed notes under your door
signed, “Your Secret Admirer
Lucinda"; or of finding urine and
fecal matter by your door. Maybe
we were exceptions to “normal”
behavior.

You were as lonely as the rest
of us in this alienated college
community—- only you chose to
express your desire to talk; to
assuage the distant silence. You
once told me, “I wish I wasn’t so
extroverted". No, that's not it ‘ol

and misunderstanding. Us nor-

mal folks put “nuts” like you in P

cages of condescending classifi-
cation ——,— when we ourselves are
often trapped by feelings of in-
adequacy.

You became our dorm’s equiv-
ilent of the obnoxious neighbor.
However, in aworld where eve-
ryone is classiﬁed as “obnox-

ious” and “nutty”, some ques-
tions come to mind: who defines
the standards by which we judge
others? Do we make fun of church
goers and look up to the likes of
Jon'Bon Jovi.? Do we put down
convenience store workers and
aspire to be corporate raiders?
Do we scorn human rights viola-
tors and maintain our ties with
nations who bask in them? Do
we put you down, departed
friend, and laugh along with the
cretin who shoveled s-— from the
toilet and onto your doorstep?
We are all actors on life's stage,
but this writer would suggest that
we have forgotten who's playing
what role.

As I return to my little corner of
the world now, I cannot help but
notice your absence. We drove
you away from here because you
threatened to challenge our self-
ish void — now, we are con-
demned to dwell in it. Even the
most ignored aspects of our daily
minutia are mysterious. It is only
through your absence that I was
able to realize this. That you
were always around this place —
even on the weekends -— was a
mystery. That you were part of
our world was a mystery. Your
stay at Pitt was a mystery because
everybody here came -to accept
it, but nobody ever expected it;
because it scratched the surface
of the cold and humanless facade
we all hide behind. And, because
of all of the universities and
dormatories, you happened to
walk into mine.

But it isn't a mystery that not a
single person on our floor will
ever forget you. Now that you ’re
gone, here's looking at you, kid.

Lady Panthers raise record to 10-5 with win over BC

By Sean Hellman
Staff Writer

The Pitt women's basketball team
recorded two wins and one loss last week,
moving its record to 10-5 (2-2 in the Big
East). The Lady Panthers had 11 wins all of
last season (11-17).

They defeated Kent State 77-66, and
Boston College 85-76, and lost to Seton
Hall 81-66.

On Saturday Pitt evened its Big East
record at Fitzgerald Field House by
defeating Boston College.

The Eagles were coming off a win
against nationally ranked Providence and
were 3-0 in the Big East.

“It’s a big win for us,” said Pitt head
coach Kirk Bruce. “It’s the kind of win we
need to stay in the hunt in the early part of
the season. In the second half of the year

in the Big East, there are more upsets than
in the [early part]. So if you can beat the
top tearris early, we’ll take our chances.”

“It’s the first time since I've been here [at
Pitt] that we've beaten them,” said senior
co-captain Jennifer Shingler. “Any time
you beat a team like this it’s a big, big win."

Connie Hurt led the Lady Panthers with
a career-high 27 points.

“lConnie] played great,” said Bruce.
“When Connie does stuff like this, it doesn’t
surprise me. I just want her to realize she
can do this game in and game out."

Coach Bruce noted before the game that
the Eagles have good perimeter shooters
but not a good inside game. Pitt took
advantage of Boston College’s weaker
inside game as Hurt was able to have one
of her better games of her college career.

“I really wanted to beat them,” said
Hurt. “They were kind of small so I had to

just take it to them. Whether I take it to the
base line or to the inside, I just got to take
it to the hoop."

Hurt was 12 for 15 from the ﬁeld.

Jill McElhinny led Pitt in rebounds (12)
from the small forward position.

Co-captain Lorri Johnson contributed
20 points for Pitt.

Boston College was led by Sarah Behn
with 26 points.

Behn’s points were tough to come by
with McElhinny playing close defense on
her.

“Jill did a nice job on defense," said
Bruce. “Sarah Behn is a great player. Jill
made her work harder than she has worked
all year to get her points.”

Pitt jumped out to a 10-2 lead on a pair
of inside jumpers by Hurt and three-
pointers from Johnson and Maureen
McConnell, forcing the Eagles to call a

timeout only two and a half minutes into
the game. ‘
Johnson answered Boston's time-out
with a layup and a 12-2 lead
The Eagles were able to force Pitt to turn

1 the ball over and get back in the game.

Boston’s Carla Wenger scored on a layup
and was fouled by Pitt's Turia Ransom
with 12:04 left in the half. Wenger converted
the three-point play to cut Pitt's lead to
one, 16-15.

The game slowed down and was played
evenly to halftime.

Johnson was able to give Pitt some
breathing room with a three-pointer to
make the score 32-26 with 2:20 left. Pitt
had a 36-30 halftime lead.

Pitt held on to a five-point lead four
minutes into the second half when

freshman Lisa Fessler hit one of two key

NEW YORK, N.Y. -— If you like to knit, then

Yes, they all saw action in Pitt's 71-70 loss to the
St. John's Redmen at Madison Square Garden.

the course of the game, some were expecting

But the song remained the same after it was all
over. The Panthers lost their ninth game of the
season, fifth consecutive, sixth out of their last
seven and fourth straight in the Big East.

In the first half, the contest went the Panthers’
way as they led for over 12 minutes. In that time
span, Pitt's leading scorer Brian Shorter picked
up eight of his 19 points. But with only four
seconds left in the half, Redmen senior guard
Greg “Boo” Harvey tickled the twine from 13

S6lnF7”6m’S tenacity
reason why they ’re
on line to tie Steelers

This almost started out as a column comparing the powerful
Pittsburgh Steelers of the 1970s to the San Francisco 49ers of right now
this very moment.

But you know, that really wouldnot have been a very sharp idea.
The game of football was so different from what it is now. The passing
rules aren’t the same. The violence in the game is more controlled
now than it was when the Steelers bludgeoned opponents to death.
Every position is much more intricate and specialized, thanks to
former San Francisco head coach Bill Walsh and Washington’s Joe
Gibbs. Money is now much more important than team loyalty. It's a
different animal altogether.

So a mano-a—mano compare—and—contrast would be, really, almost

 

a futile effort. Sort of along the lines of taking a big, thick handful of
paper napkins in the cafeteria when you always end up using only
one. It's a waste.

Battle that one out in a bar somewhere. I'm sure I will.

Now, let’s talk about the 49ers. Let’s talk about why the San
Francisco 49ers are making a total mockery of the National Football
League’s other clubs.

How can this team, with more than a handful of impact players from
unknown schools like Delaware State, Angelo State, Santa Clara,
Texas-Arlington, Middle Tennessee State, Hawaii and Mississippi
Valley State, be realistically capable of racking up a 14-2 regular-
season record, then outscoring its playoff opponents 71-16 en route
to its fourth Super Bowl title of the decade, and make it look easier
than grocery shopping? Let’s talk about John Taylor and Pierce Holt
and BrentJones and Tim McKyer/ Bruce Collie and Donnie Griffin and
Jesse Sapolu and Jerry Rice. Aside from their respective schools,
where did these guys come from?

Let’s talk about the veteran castoffs the team has acquired and their
respective impacts. Players like Matt Millen, Mike Sherrard, Terry
Greer and Jim Burt, who were Plan B’ed or waived outright by their
former teams, and, by landing in San Francisco, have made a great
situation even better.

Let’s talk about unprecedented perfection. Let’s talk about Joe

 Depth of bench keeps Ladies

competitive despite injuries

By Sean Heilman
Staff Writer

Unlike the men’s team, the Pitt
women’s basketball team has
thrived on a strong bench this
season. The Lady Panthers have
jumped to a 10-5 record with
every player holding an important
role.

Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce has
needed his bench to play well
with his two captains facing
injuries.

Shooting guard Jennifer
Shingler has missed five games
this season because of an ankle
injury. The injury, which she
suffered in the preseason,
sidelined her for the Lady Panther
Invitational (two games) at the
start of the season. She
reaggravated it against Cleveland
State at the Burger King Holiday
Classic in Miami, Fla., causing
her to miss three more games.

All-American candidate Lorri
Johnson had reconstructive
surgery on both knees in 1986.
The knees may be starting to
wear down.

Johnson, a forward, had her
knees drained after an 85-72 win
against Georgetown on Jan. 6.
Johnson often does knee
exercises on the bench when she
is not in the game. Coach Bruce
gives her a rest when necessary.

Johnson averages 27.6 minutes
per game.

With concern over Pitt’s two
experienced players, Coach Bruce
has had to rely on his bench.

“Our bench is so strong,” said .

Shingler. “You could take the
next five [players] and start them.”
Shingler believes Pitt’s second

ﬁve players wouldbe competitive ~

in the Big East.

The bench is not there only to
replace Johnson and Shingler but
also to give a player like center

Connie Hurt a rest.

The breaks helped Hurt’s game
on Saturday. She scored a career-
high 27 points in an 85-76 win
against Boston College at
Fitzgerald Field House.

“Lately, I've been getting tired
kind of quick,” said Hurt. “Coach
has been taking me out, giving
me some rest. I really need the
rest.”

Sophomore Sandy Baker and
freshman Turia Ransom were
calledon by Coach Bruce to fill in
inside.

Sandy Baker had a big game
off the bench on Saturday. She
scored four points and collected
five rebounds in 12 minutes of

play.

“I usually give Lorri a rest,” said
Baker. “IfI come in for Lorri, I can

either shoot or dish it off inside.

Swimmers pull out close meet

By Adam Kamras
Staff Writer

With the score tied at 1 13 going
into the last event, Pitt’s 400-yard
freestyle relay team of Mike and
Joe Kozlina, Bill Folger and Eric
Cornell defeated Penn State’s relay
team by .08 of a second, giving
Pitt a 124-119 victory.

“It's one of the most exciting
meets I’ve ever been in," said Pitt
Coach Dick Bradshaw.

Joe Kozlina felt the team really
pulled together at the end in an
effort to win the meet for team
captains Mike Kozlina, Tim Adams
and Bill Folger. The three seniors
had not defeated Penn State since
their freshman year and very
much wanted to win their ﬁnal
meet against them.

Mike Kozlina led the Panthers
with three victories, also winning
the 200-yard backstroke and
being a member of the 400-
medley relay with Matt Weist,
Tim Adams and Joe Kozlina.

Folger used his role as captain
to set an example for the team.

“I showed how bad I wanted
it," he said. “It was the first time

.. .  ._ V

this season the team came
together as one."

Pitt won a total of eight out of
13 events, with its other swimming
victories coming from Dave
Schepner (1000 free), Tim Adams
(50 free) and Eric Mattson (200
individual medley). J o h n
Sharkey was victorious in both
the 1- and 3—meter diving events.

Bradshaw said, “It was a great
feeling and a real strong team
effort.”

Although Penn State has a
stronger team on paper, both
Bradshaw and much of the team
felt Pitt’s attitude played a big
part.

“To win a meet like this you
have to be conﬁdent,” said
Bradshaw.

“We were all really up,” said
Folger. He said that Pitt probably
wanted the victory more than
Penn State.

Folger said the fan support
played a big part for the Panthers.
Many families and friends of the
team made the trip east for the
meet and made themselves heard,
especially during the ﬁnal event

The meet will be televised next

Continued from page 9

The game of football is not
designed for a quarterback to
complete 79.6 percent of his
passes. Or 70.2 percent over an
entire season as Montana also
did this season. The game is too
complex; a completed pass
depends on, ﬁrst, good play-
calling, then good blocking and
sharp pass routes and downﬁeld
adjustments and great play—fakes
before the football ever becomes
airborne. Then, the receiver must,
ultimately, catch the football in
his hands whether he is wide
open or not. 

All the elements are there for

the 49ers ‘to have a successful

passing game. However, 79.6
percent is not successful; it is
football deiﬁcation. A
Let’s talk about superior
execution of fundamental football
techniqueson both sides of the
ball. Eetfs talk about why taiiback

Roger Craig wraps   .

around the football when
defenders are in position to make
the tackle. Or why Craig
consistently uses the basic high-
step run when in tight traffic, or
to make the leg tackle all the
more difficult when he bursts
into the open ﬁeld. Or the
technique of Joe Montana, the
best play-action quarterback in
football. Or the precise routes of
Jerry Rice and John Taylor. Or
perfectly timed explosion of
tackle Harris Barton on toss sweep
left.

Let’s talk about players doing
everything the position requires:
tight ends that block and catch,
like they’re supposed to. Fullback
Torn Rathman, an excellent
upfield runner, can block like a
wrecking. ball. Rathman also
caught more passes (73) than any
back in football this year, aside

from his normal rushing duties. A

fullback is supposed-to  able to
block, run and catch; Rathman

it that people designate great
defenses simply by the number
of sacks they accumulate?
Minnesota sacked the hell out of
the NFL in 1989. San Francisco

ago, andMinnesota was supposed
to have a great defense.

Isn’t defense primarily about

stopping the other team from.

scoring? Sacks don’t win football
games. Knocking QBs out of the
game doesn’t designate great
defense. In those terms, the
Chicago Bears had the greatest
defense ever from 1984-86. How
many Super Bowls has Chicago
ever been to? How many has
Minnesota ever won?

The 49ers’ defense simply stops

other teams from scoring. Nothing

fancy. Their zone defenses are

' extremely well-disciplined." Their.

While you are pondering, that

most of the credit for San

does it really matter, in retrospect’
Shakespeare once wrote,
“Some men are born great, some
men acquire greatness, and some
men have greatness thrust upon
them.” With the 49ers, it is a
smooth blend of all three.

Do yourself a great favor and
watch this team play as much as
you possibly can, whether the
game is close or the 49ers are
winning by 27 with a half to play.
Appreciate exactly what ’ is
happening every time San
Francisco takes the field, and at
the same time, enjoy it, no matter
who you are rooting for.

The 49ers and their system are
to the game of football what

is to design.

three-pointers to give Pitt a 47-39
lead at 15:11.

Fessler later assisted on a layup
by McConnell to complete a two-
on-one fast break, giving the Lady
Panthers a 13-point lead, 65-52.

Pitt’s offense stalled and Behn’s
free throws cut the lead to five
with 4:26 to play. -

Fessler came down the ﬂoor
with 4:07 to play, hitting her
second clutch three-pointer and
retaking an eight-point lead,
breaking Boston’s momentum.

“That was the biggest shot of
the game,” said Bruce. “We got a
little tentative on offense. But
Lisa Fessler will never be tentative
on offense.”

Boston College never got closer.

“This will send a message
around the league,” said Shingler.
“We have to start gaining’ some
respect."

Coach Bruce was able to avoid
overusing Johnson and risk
wearing down her sore knees.
She played 28 minutes. Her
average is 27.6 minutes a game.

“We..didn’t need to extend her
[playing time]. If we can do that
with Lorri, we're going to be
fine.”

Jennifer Shingler started her
second consecutive game. She is
coming back from the second
injury to her right ankle this season
and played with an air cast on the
ankle. “It’s getting there, ” Shingler
said.

Coach Bruce said her ankle still
is not 100-percent ready, but the
team needed her senior
leadership.

Pitt will play at Syracuse on
Wednesday and at home against
St. John’s next Sunday at 2 p.m.

never relinquished the lead. Not
to say that the Redmen’s blood
pressure didn’t increase a few

times near the end of the game. i

Pitt’s Pat Cavanaugh sunk two
clutch three—pointers with under
40 seconds left to keep the
Panthers within one point of a
tie.

With under 20 seconds to play,
Cavanaugh attempted a jump shot
at the top of the key which missed
the mark. St. John’s grabbed the
rebound and it was all over.

“I was just trying to get us back
into the game," Cavanaugh said.
“I was looking to take the three
because I knew they were playing
Jason [Matthews] tight the whole
game.

“It was so hectic. I should have
taken [the ball] out and settled
everybody down," he said of his
missed jump—shot attempt

The Panthers’ foul shooting was
sub—par, bordering on atrocious:
55 percent in the first half and 61
percent for the game. They
managed to miss 14 free throws
on 36 attempts, and Shorter went
to the line 19 times and missed 10
charity points.

“I don't know what we shot
from the foul line for the game,
but that was one of the reasons
[for the lossl,” Cavanaugh said.

“It could have put us up more
in the ﬁrst half, and in the second
half, any time you’re shooting
around [60 percent], you’re not
going to win too many games,”

he added.

The Panthers also got beat to
the boards, both offensively and
defensively, as they were out-
rebounded by a convincing 47-
30 margin.

“Everyone on their team was
going to the boards,” Shorter said.
“It’s real hard to box out and grab
rebounds when everybody is
going to the boards.”

But the Panthers may have
found the rebounds easier to
come by toward the end of the

game.

Both Jayson Williams (6-foot-
10) and Robert Werdann (6-foot-
11) fouled out of the game.
Werdann made an early exit at
7:18, but Williams hung on until
the 3:43 mark.

The Redmen countered with
big man Sean Muto and a not-so-
big man, 6-foot—6 Chuck Sproling.

The theme of the Redmen’s
substitutions was “size over

substance" as the two ﬁll-ins
posted no points and one rebound
between them.

Shorter had high praise to give
to the Panther substitutes, who
allowed several key players to
rest as they capably did their job.

“I think they did a pretty good
job. We had a couple mental
lapses and [the substitutes]
allowed us to get back into the
game. We just made some bad
