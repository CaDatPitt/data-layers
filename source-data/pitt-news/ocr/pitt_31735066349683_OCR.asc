BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Provost area faculty rejected
unionization last week, with 60% of
the 1,100 votes counted yesterday
cast for No Representation. The No
Representation option won over the
Pitt Professional Union (PPU) by
224 ballots.

The count of votes cast in last
week’s runoff between No Repre-
sentation and the PPU showed 662

V? "3 tes for No Representation and

438 for the PPU with 32 ballots
challenged on legal grounds.
Roughly 87% of eligible faculty
voted irtthe election.

While the No Representation win
will forestall another union election
for at least one year, PPU President
Van Beck Hall said his organiza-
tion -will continue activity on
campus;

“We only lost by 10%," Hall
observed.” and things aren’t going

‘ P to be getting any better on this

campus in the next three years.

,§,The 40%. vote for the PPU shows a

 sizable ‘number of ' faculty are

willing to back a tough union."

Non-Renewal
Of Dr. Nyden

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
AND SUSAN MANNELLA

Supporters of assistant socio-
logy professor Paul Nydcn are
planning a "funeral for academic
freedom" today at noon which will
include the burial of a coffin on the
Cathedral front lawn. The
demonstration is in protest of
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean
Jerome Rosenberg's. support of
a sociology department decision to
refuse Nydcn another contract at
Pitt. according to Linda Nydcn.

“It'll probably be just a small
gathering of the immediate fami-
ly." Linda Nydcn said. “We were
going to invite Monsignor Charles

4, Owen Rice to preside at the
ceremony. but it turns out it might
be slightly sacriligeous."

Nydcn yesterday received a
letter from Rosenberg stating the
Dean's decision to accept the
recommendation of the sociology
department senior faculty not to
renew Nyden's contract. The letter
represents the Dean's ﬁnal decisi-
on on the department ruling to
deny Nydcn another contract.

A g Rose-nberg's letter said‘ he has
concluded. after his own review of

» the sociology department's investi-

gation. thatit was "a very careful

~,«g;oi1e." It went on to say Rosenberg
js "convinced that (Nyden's) senior 4

vote, said the high turnout coupled
with the strength of yesterday’s
pro-union vote is a warning to the
administration. '

‘‘I'm sure it's clear to the
Chancellor that most faculty are
unhappy with current situation of
governance. rThough they don’t
want the legal burden of a union,
they do want change through the
present systems,” Amett said.

“l think the time is right for
changes in the way faculty

participate in University decision-
making,” Arnett added. “Speciﬁ-
cally we have proposals before the
University Senate Council for
reactivating the Senate structure
here."

—While Arnett said TIF member-
ship individually would seek
changes in the University Senate
system, Hall said the PPU would
not take an active role in revamping
current governance structures.

Protest Disrupts SGB Tuition Rally

BY CRIS HALL

Members of the Student
Coalition Against Tuition Hikes
(SCATH) occupied a Student Union
stage and wrestled a microphone
from Chancellor .Wesley . Posvar
Wednesday afternoon, turning a
Student Government l3'oard- (SGB)
sponsored anti-tuition rally into a
confrontation between opposing
anti-tuition groups.

After listening to speeches from
SGB President Barry Weisband

and University Trustee Al Lawton, .

sign-toting SCATH members ﬁled
onto the Fifth Avenue porch of the
Student Union and stood by as
Weisband read a letter outlining
student opposition to any increase
in tuition. The letter was presented

and continued strong showings in
the polls. Jimmy Carter meets
hostility where ever he campaigns,
including Pittsburgh, where he
spoke Wednesday.

As Weisband finished, reading
the letter, and attempted to give
the microphone to Posvar, a
SCATH member seized the micro-'

phone and handed it to SCATH’

spokesperson Dianne Gessler. A
The Chancellor then retreated‘

into the Student unio-tr-- while i

SCATH members commanded‘ stu-

dents’ attention. '
SCATH members had planned to

present petitions to Posvar expres-

sing student opposition to the hike, 

but were unable to because of his
exit from the S.U. porch.

of the state’s 178 delegate votes.

The harried candidate met with
an aggressive press corps in Mayor
Pete Flaherty's office to answer
questions about a remark _he had
made the previous day in Indiana.

Carter. who had said the federal
government should not interfere
with the “ethnic purity" of urban
neighborhoods or the economic
homogeneity of wealthy suburbs,
denied Wednesday those remarks
had any racist overtones.

“What l was saying was that l
do not think established neighbor-
hoods should be disrupted by
government." Carter said. —

He said he resented the
suggestion he had meant any
speciﬁc race or ethnic group should

be closed out of neighborhoods.

pledge to restructure the federal
government if he is voted into the

“This is_ a serious crisis,”'she
said. “Yet they treat ‘it like a
circus." Gessler referred to the
presence of a rock band, hired by

l the SGB to attract student interest

in the rally. .
She also attacked the SGB as
unresponsive to student needs." _
' “The ‘SGB’ does not represent
night students, black students,
graduate students, students from
other campuses, or even under-

claimed. 6 V 1 '
Many. of Gessler’s comments

were greeted ‘byboos "from the ‘

student audience.’ SCATH mem-

shouting match with the crowd.

students if they wished to hear the
Chancellor speak. When’ the
majority of students indicated their
desire to hear Posvar, Weisband

Pitt football players Tom Perko
and John Pelusi were acquitted
yesterday of charges they assaulted
a Bucks County man and an
Oakland woman in. a November
scufﬂe outside The Wooden Keg. o

Allegheny County Judge Joseph
Ridge found Pelusi and Perko
innocent of charges of aggravated
assault following a four-day trial.

The judge ruled that Pelusi, a

junior center, had not committed
assault and that senior linebacker
Perko had used only justifiable
force after first being struck by
Robert Carney of Langhorne, who
pressed charges along with Carol
Livingston. '

Judge Ridge had delayed a

yesterday. pending the testimony

Hike «Rally

The SCATH demonstration came
following a decision by SGB not to
include SCATH in the rally.
Angered by that decision, SCATH
voted Tuesday to disrupt the rally.

Several hundred students, drawn
in part by the rock group, "Gravel,
attended the pre-noon rally.

Executive I Assistant to the
Chancellor Edward Bozik said
yesterday he did not believe the
SCATH members were representa-
tive of the majority of Pitt students.

He also said he did not believe
the afternoon's occurences would
bring any damaging publicity to the
University in its f1ght'to hold down
tuition through increased state
appropriations.

Groups Hit SCA TH Action

BY DEANNA L. CONGILEO

The Student Coalition Against
Tuition Hikes (SCATH) has main-
tained ofﬁcial organizational sup-
port since its demonstration
against the Student Government
Board (SGB) at'the tuition rally,
although several SCATH endorsers
criticised Wednesday’s backlash at
SGB.
, .,__ According to Commuter Asso-
4‘ . fciation member Tom Pochapsky, no
ofﬁcial commuter representative
participated in SCATH’s protest.

“The feud between SCATH and
the SGB is silly. They should
combine forces,” Pochapsky said.
“We want to prevent a tuition
hike.”

All the groups contacted support
SCATH’s philosophy against cut-
backs and tuition increases. It’s
SCATH’s approach tocombating
these elements to which several
object. _

“We don't approve of SCATH’s
 trying to buck the SGB,” said Ken‘
..»» Gabriel of the Engineering Student

Cabinet (ESC).

“The SGB istworking slowly,”
Gabriel said. “But they're heading
in" the right direction.”

The Resident Student Associa-
tion (RSA) has taken no active role
in SCATH for several weeks
because its members have mixed
feelings about the quality of
SCATH’-s methods to combat the
tuition hike, RSA President Marty
Doerﬂer said.

The Young Socialist Alliance_

(YSA), which participated actively
in SCATH until recently took no
part in the protest against SGB,
because they disagreed with
SCATH’s tactics.

“We can understand the dis-
agreement between SCATH and
the SGB, but we feel they took the
wrong approach, “YSA_ member
Rich _Gollub said. _

Active particpants in SCATH’s
picket line and demonstration
included Black Action Society
(BAS) and Union of Graduate
Employes members. Both organi-
zations totally support SCATH.

“Sitting around listening to
music doesn't make the tuition hike
go away,” BAS spokesman Carl

(Continual from Page I)

“We took our shot at it,” Hall
said. “Now it’s up to the TIF
people to prove they can make all
the changes in the system, that they
promised.”

Y esterday’s count was necessita-
ted‘ by an earlier election in the
Provost area that included the
PPU,’the American Association of
University Professors (AAUP), the
Pennsylvania State Education As-
sociation (PSEA) and No Represen-
tation as ballot options. No single
option garnered the required
simple" majority in that contest.

In the March election the PPU
won the runoff slot against No
Representation by edging out the
AAUP by one - percent. No
Representation took 48% of ballots
cast in the initial March vote, with
the PPU taking 21%.‘ '

In a statement released yester-
day, Chancellor Wesley Posvar
noted the final Provost area count

settled the issue of faculty,union-,

ization for the moment.

“This administration remains
"committed to the principle . of
faculty participation in policy
making at the University. Faculty,
staff and students must continue to
work together to achieve the goals
and resolve the problems that
challenge us,” Posvar said in the
release.

The Provost area count and the
defeat for the PPU draws to a close
a three-year campaign by the PPU,
AAUP and PSEA to win the right to
bargain for -Pitt faculty on the terms

470 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh ”

of Out ofgthe Spotlight

The Student Coalition Against Tuition Hikes (SCATH) claims
Wednesday’s rally, sponsored by the Student Government Board
(SGB), was a circus. Ifit‘ was, it was SCATH itself that was the main
event. Their disruption of the rally and attempt to take it over was a

-  foolish and irresponsible act. It shows SCATH is an ineffectual and

frustrated group that has to resort to theatrics to get any attention.
By interrupting the rally, and by pulling the microphone out of the
hands of the Chancellor in front of the news media—-or perhaps

because of it—-they created a childish image of Pitt students in the ‘

public minds. Temper tantrums are not the kind of behavior that

belongs on a college campus. p
' Their anger is understandable because of the SGB’s decision to not

permit SCATH any participation in the rally, but their performance at

. the rally, in front" of the local TV cameras, wastcounterproductive.

It showed state legislators there is no uniﬁed drive to ﬁght the tuition
hike '

  SCATH’s action /at Wednesday’s rally shows they are more
 ooncemed with rhetoric, and political debate, than with the issue at

hand. They claim they want more student participation in the tuition

question, but they disrupted an attempt by the SGB to do just that.
SCATH purports to be representative of a large bloc of students, but

cannot even agree among themselves about the best method of ﬁghting

' the tuition hike-—-many of SCATH’s own members did not support its

behavior.

We have always supported a. coalition of students that could ' I

effectively represent the divergent student groups on campus. We

fj ‘ I ;hoped, at ﬁrst, that SCATH could do the job. Even after SGB withdrew

its support of SCATH, we-had the faint hope the two groups would
avoid ﬁghting among themselves and devote their. efforts to ﬁghting
the tuitionincrease. We hoped later two separate groups, each
working in its own way, woultl produce the best results.
But this was not to bethe case. SCATH spent more time ﬁnding

 I fault with son than they did ﬁghting the tuition hike. They had some

valid points but failed to work toward them in an effective manner.
"Their methods were based on the assumption that it was the Good
Guys vs. the Bad Guys——the bad guys being the administration and the
Board of Trustees. VV1th a chip on their shoulders, they went to work,
and wondered why everybody was picking on them. .
— We needed SCATH. We needed an organization that could have
gotten the student body active in dealing with the tuition question.
They would have been invaluable if they could have risen above
personal vendettas and dealt with the issues at hand.
But they didn’t. Instead, they have worked against everyone else,
refusing to admit they weren’t the sole purveyors of truth. SCATH’s
refusal to work, as a team against the tuition hike, is making the ﬁght a
little harder.
Clearly it is time for SCATH to step out of the spotlight.

Hold Line On Tuition

we hope the administration realizes that the infantile behavior

. exhibited by the members of SCATH who were demonstrating at

' Wednesday’s rally is not representative of the whole student body.

What SCATI-I members did to Chancellor Wesley Posvar and -to the

I students who were willing to hear his side of the story was inexcusable,

. and was no way to battle tuition hikes. However, the tuition issue is
still an important one.

We realize the bind the administration has found itself in with the

probability of minimal state appropriations this year. We also realize

- there is a legitimate need to adequately compensate the faculty and
I ' staff for their work, and that means a higher salary budget.

iWe realize too, further cutbacks would be fatal for many

A p_ programs, and would seriously impair many others.

What we hope the administration realizes, and remembers through

aevery step of the budget process, is that each time tuition is

raised—-whether by 4% or 40%-—the students’ must suffer.

Higher education is expensive now, and many students are just
barely meeting the costs. Increasing the cost of a college education
lowers the number of students who can attend.

There is no easy answer, or someone would have suggested it long
ago. It is a sorry thing the government and the taxpayers do not care
enough about education to adequately fimd it, but reversing that trend

- will take longer than the few weeks left before the University must
complete its budget. _ 

For now, we can only appeal to the administration to remember the
. concerns of legitimate student groups who want to hold the line on
Ituition.

Impressions

A Day

BY TOM WASELESKI

They descended‘like the ever-

‘returning locusts, noisy fomenters

of pestilence across the campus
political map. Their incessant
chirping could be seen on the faces
of signs and leaﬂets, “Party now,
pay later” and “Weisband and
Posvar sleep in the same bed.” The
droning bzzzzzzzzz, conﬁned most-
ly to Student Union walls and front
pages, echoed off tree trunks and
against traffic in one of its rare
open air appearances, the signs
passing each other through the
otherwise unnoticing crowd that
listened to the band.

There had been much talk since,

the great SCATH-SGB split that
each would let the other do its thing
in order to stall rising _ tuitions.
Well, here was a new twist;

SCATH protesting a student -'

protest!

‘It becomes, obvious now what the
“coalition’s” intent is; salvation,
or more ‘appropos, “liberation,”
via SCATH and no one else. It has
demonstrated no room for the
opinions of other student groups,

even the SGB, which wields a
constituency of some 13,000.

You’ll recall the level of enlighten-
ment on the part of one SCATH
after the break-up:

“There are only seven people on
SGB, representing a limited sector

of course, to SCATH, which has
some 30-60 members (depending

 

4-

' of the student body,” as opposed, _

on how the spirit moves-them) who »

have appointed themselves repres-
entatives of not only day under-
grads, but night andigrad students
as well.

Their tactics have polarized an
entire‘ student body, frightening
the average tuition-payer into
lbeliéving the only way to maintain
the present price level is to chant

slogans and use dozens of
exclamation points in written
sentences.‘

It was clear’ at‘ the SGB’s
anti-hike rally‘—-which included a

‘band for the simple reason of

$6." '\

For Ego-Building

was clear in the leaﬂets theyﬁ;

passed out that they were trying to
deny the SGB any success in
drawing students, more of which
nevertheless attended the rally
than had ever been present" at a
SCATH gathering.

It was clear when a handful of
them heckled the ‘Chancellor,
whose only intention was to speak,
fondly reminiscent of SCATH’s
collective display of primal therapy
when Vice Chancellor Jack Free-
man attempted to speak (after all,
they invited him) at SCATH’s
“teach-in.” '

" It was clear what SCATH’s intent
was when it wrenched

the _

microphone from the Chancellor’£3:’

hands. The ideology had ﬁnally
taken over the issue, with SCATH
in a death-struggle for ‘some

  Next Year’sChallenge I

In both of the recent elections, there has been high faculty support

- for unionization as a means of changing what some feel is a rapidly
’ deteriorating situation at this University and in higher education in
' general. ‘ -

Though it has been rejected this year, the unionization question can
be expected to return someday soon. The unions have pledged to
remain. 4 i

It is clear that if the administration wishes the University to remain
union-free, they will have to make whatever changes are necessary
within the current University governing structures.

I University governance that is responsive to the needs of faculty, and, I

equally, students, is the challenge of the year to come.

...And Finally "

Remember the two-day reading periods that allowed students to
catch up with all of the work they missed during the normal term before
the ﬁnals crunch came full force? ‘Well, there are no reading days this

term, and many students are rightfully upset.

The brief lull between classes and tests was valuable, and for many.
essential. It is too late to reinstitute the reading period for the current

term. but not for next year. We don't think it’s too much to ask.

It was '

large. Tuition hikes no longer

mattered, it was the survival of the” " ,

collective at stake here. Steal that
mike, grab the floor at a rally that
you didn’t support. Hell, it’s ‘a
captive audience, make it yours.

A great day for ego—building, but

tuition? '

Adequate Office

’ Space Needed

Next fall Pitt students will have
the privilege of paying more and
getting less. Tuition is being
increased once again, while pro-
grams,afacilities and services to
students are being cut back.

For example, the administration
recently decided to expand the
Office of Student Affairs and the
Learning Skills Center within the
Student Union. Student organiza-
tions are being reshuffled so the

administrative bureaucracy can
expand.
Terry Milani, Student Union

manager. predicted that perhaps
as many as seventeen “inactive”
student organizations will share the
same offices. He also thought that
the ' Undergraduate Women's
Union, Gay Students at Pitt,
Student Coalition Against Racism,
The Third World Peoples Coalition
and the Young Socialist, Alliance
would share the same suite of
offices. \
Student organizations have a
right to adequate office space. If
administrative offices wish to
expand, they should not do so in
the Student Union. Indeed, one
wonders how the University bur-
eaucracy can expand at all when

For some time I have been
advocating as a top priority for
Greater Pittsburgh a mass rapid
transit line to connect Oakland with
Downtown and Northside, and also
with Shadyside and points east.

The configuration of Pittsburgh
is such that these areas, properly
linked, can be fused into the
prototype of a 21st Century,
modernized nuclear city, an excit-

j »ing and rewarding place for its

' citizens to live and work.

I have taken a front position on
this for two main reasons. First, I
think an inner-city transit system
could be the difference between
urban decay and metropolitan
vitality. Second, I believe the
University’s leadership role ex-
tends beyond its own self-interest
(and its own immediate neighbor-
hood) to include a concern for the
quality of life in any region where

Pitt students have a major stake

personal lives and your careers. As
supporters.of a city rapid transit
system, your numbers and your
influence can be a major force in
bringing it into being.

al record and that alleged political
factors were not involved in the

The Rosenberg letter advised
Nyden he is “entitled to receive a
statement of reasons for the
unfavorable decision."

Nyden said last night he will ask
the Dean for a copy of the complete

.14-page report prepared by the‘

department's‘ review committee
and will not be satisﬁed simply
with a statement listing reasons for

nanrenewal of his contract, which-
’  expire April 30, 1977.

‘-‘Rather than a statement of the
reasons for the decision, I am
asking for the complete report,”
Nyden said. “Just some statement
on the decision is not enough.”

Nyden said he intends to follow
through the appeal procedure of
the Senate Committee on Tenure
and Academic Freedom. ‘

Nyden also said he “most
definitely" will fulfill his contract
tit Pitt.

rather than “where” to go about it.
It is my contention that for mass

_ rapid transit, the “where" is the

compact inner city itself. not the
suburbs. It is in the center that the
people and the institutions present
a demand for high volume, fast,
and frequent movement. The
present need for such service is
critical within the city core, where
an estimated three-quarters of all

‘working trips take place, the other

one-quarter coming from the
suburbs into the central city.

The automobile may never be
challenged in remote, low density
population areas. Consider,
besides convenience, the econo-
mics: An estimated 80 percent of
the cost of operating public transit
is the labor, and the driver of the
private auto is “free.” ‘Costly
capitallresources are not wisely
spent on far-ﬂung stations and

will require an intermediate scale

innovative applications, of which
“dial-a-bus” may be one. ’All
these outer services should link up
with the central system of mass
rapid transit.

In planning for transportation

highways with a depreciated value
of at least $20 to $30 billion. This
makes a very strong case in the
near and mid-term future for use of
buses, when possible. on exclusive
high-speed central lanes, and also
slower buses to operate in car-free
zones in the central city'. In many
cities, it should make sense to use
these street and highway modes in
the interim, until the advanced,
high-speed rapid system can be
funded and built. At the
intermediate distances, the express
bus may be the best long-term
solution.

I am not too concerned with
technology for mass‘ rapid transit,
forideas abound. Most of the
options would be satisfactory in

terms of service, so questions of .

comparative cost and environmen-
tal impact become dominant.
However, I plead one belief: The

We have in Pittsburgh some
sound starting points. Unlike many
American urban areas, the city
could not expand outward in
concentric rings, thus leaving a
massive inner core of decay. That

"if it had been a satellite it
would have been a dead loss," said
astronaut Gerald Carr about the
Skylab IV mission he commanded
from November. 1973 to February,
1974. “The craft developed serious
complications a few times, but
having men aboard using judgment
and initiative saved the mission."

Carr spoke Wednesday night
about his 84-day mission in a
speech advocating manned space-
ﬂight for the enrichment of
earthbound technology.

“Satellites can’t think for them-

selves. Data is more valuable if the

use of satellites is augmented by
manned stations."

He compared the past, present
and future of manned spaceﬂight to
three phases. Phase one was the

two was the Skylab missions which
showed that man could stay in

can work in space over an extended

period of time, with the eventual"

establishment of manned stations.

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

Joumeying through Backspace
is_ like experiencing an ancient
Japanese tea ceremony. ' Back-
space, like the tearoom itself, is an
ephemeral medium that encloses a
moment of poetic intuition.

Backspace, an outgrowth of the
defunct literary journal Ideas and
Figures, is a magazine without
apparent purpose beyond that of
enveloping the reader’s imagina-
tion. The authors of the poetry and
prose empty their creative thoughts
onto the pages, and the reader is

 free to sample at will.

There is no clear theme that
pervades Backspace, but the

‘scattered perceptions of life,

coming from many different
directions and arriving at the same

point, are bound to strike a note of 

recognition.

The anthology is heavily weight-
ed toward poetry, and most
selections manage to defeat the
rash of triteness which seems to
overwhelmso many aspiring
writers. Poetry doubles as a

J * storytelling device and as a vehicle

for expressing abstract thoughts.

1 . But, poetry that is more than

aesthetically pleasing is the pri-
mary obstacle for a literary
magazine that is for the reader as
well as the author.

I A few of the poems,'such as Tom
Paul's “The Pond,” Michael
“Winter” and Ralph
Magnotti, Jr.’s “Lost in Time,”

' are simply ordinary.

Daniel L. Klauck’s “Farewell

‘Tribute to ‘a Lonely Little Girl Who

 

,p;g*¢ NEWS-Frida3y,'April"9, 1976 1 ‘

Grew, Up Too Fast” is a striking
piece, which gives much to the
reader in terms of feelings on life,’
The piece is a sequence of ten short
poems meant to be read as one.
The construction is such that the
reader is bound to be drawn into a
story of the high and low points
characteristic of life and of the
burning hurt of aloneness,

Michelle M. Noullet’s “Poem
from Watching Ralph Blakelock’s
‘Moonlight’ ” is special in its
mystical images of moonlight and
emotion.

The four short stories in
Backspace prove to be the most
interesting pieces in the magazine.
“The Indivisible Man,” by Jeff
Jacobs, explains in ﬂeeting visions
the metamorphosis from two to one
as the main character ﬁghts the
torture of a broken romance. The

ARTS  

/

 ‘Backspace’--Writing Outlet

plot is complicated, because the
misfortune of the main character,
Miles, is caused by his close friend
Pearl. the characterizations of
Miles and Pearl are well handled in
this short piece. Although the
characterization of the woman lacks
depth, it does not matter, because
the story’s central focus is on Miles
and his ability to transcend reality.

Alex Levin's “The Essence of
Nada” follows the same vein as
Jacob's piece, using a more
abstract vision of a young boy's
disillusionment and dissatisfaction.

In places the images pass by too
quickly for the reader to grab a
strong hold on the more abstract
passages.

Janet Lang’s “Iris Fishes a Deep
Drawer” and Jay Eisenhofer’s
“Rust" are less abstract examina-
tions of real life and real people.
“Iris Fishes a Deep Drawer” deals
with a young girl’s . attempt to
reconcile her parents’ divorce, and
her unsuccessful attempt to believe
in her father. “Rust” is the story
of several men running away. Each
character is running from his own
particular ‘life situation. The story
runs in a cycle expertly handled by
Eisenhofer.

Backspace itself is probably one
of the best things to happen to

fiction writers at Pitt. With very
few _exceptions the material in
Backspace is well-chosen and
readable. The literary efforts of
Pitt students are like" exotic brands
of tea. All of them may not taste
good, but they're worth trying.»

Easy GoingMeditation

BY NORM MARTELLO

. How To Do It Meditation, by,Alan

Watts, Pyramid, p.p.63, $1.25

Running for your life—if it’s
forced—is a drag. Although
avoiding a rat-race pace has been
an age old dilemma, it’s apparently
getting tougher in modern Ameri-
can life. More than ever before
we’re told that relief cannot be
found in a doctor’s office or on your
grandma's lap. “It exists inside
you alone," we’re told, “and my
g.uru’s method will show you how
to get there.”

Obtaining money, knowledge or
instruction on operating a motor
vehicle is like anything else: only
you can achie_ ’ 5 -:for yourself. But

  

~ often you caiffe i‘ to knowledge-

able people or some kind of
instruction, as signposts, for your
destination.

Cutting through the baloney

' within you and without you to

relax, refresh or revitalize your
energy and gain new insight is
what meditation—no matter who
pushes it——is all about.

Alan Watts, for over two decades
now, has been the ’ foremost
interpreter of Eastern philos_ophies
for Meditation, a pamphlet-size
paperback with pages that alter-
nate pictures, text and white space,
minces no words.‘ It gets to the

any kind.

“...the essential principle (is)
that meditation is supposed to be
fun—it's not something you do as a
grim duty. The trouble with
religion today is that it is so mixed
up with grim duties. You do it
because it is good for you. It’s a
kind of self-punishment. Meditati-
on when correctly done has nothing
to do with that. It-’s a kind of
“digging" the present...the place
where it’s at is simply here and
now."

Meditation is not just a brief
philosophical discussion. Because
of its emphasis on a relaxed going
out of your mind to discover your
senses, it's also a book of diversion
and simple pleasure...not _ at all
removed from the purpose of the
Japanese tea ceremony or the
Christian retreat. A joyful little
book, it has pictures of bridges and
waterfalls. flowers and incense,
sun shining and waves breaking.
Other pleasures Watts includes are
the use of prayer beads, as a
time-keeping device; chanting and
basic mantras used by religions the
world over; and incense.

Incense occupies the latter
portion of the book as Watts offers
much glory to the seldom appreci-
ated nose. As in the first portion,
this section offers practical advice
on buying good—- incense (“...the
sweetness of. fresh strawberries or
ﬁne honey . .9<2r.np;a.r.<:c1  .,t..0.7 ..t!1e_.

of incense, how it’s burned, and
what it's used for the world over. It
explains the mysterious question-
able statement of Zen master ‘old
Dr. Suzuki: “The smell of gingko
is the smell of Buddhism.”

' The Book of Tea by Kakuzo
Okakura (Dover, $1.25, pp. 76,
originally published in 1906) is
another book I can recommend as
an introduction to the Oriental way
of thinking. It relates the history of
tea making with “th'e connection of
Zennism with Tea," the tea room
ceremony, art appreciation, and
flower arrangement. It is as
uncumbersome and fun as Medita-
tion.

A bit of a warning, though.
Meditation, like fasting or dieting,

‘Creative Pittsburgh’
Bed of Latent Talent

BY TOM WASELESKI

Little magazines, obscure though
they may be, have afforded, among
others, Wolfe, Joyce and Heming-
way with opportunities for expos-
ure and encouragement in their
young careers.

Creative Pittsburgh, a locally
based magazine, continues in this
' same vein, having released its first
collection of fiction and poetry.
Though it’s wellworth sampling, it
understandably has a way to.go
before it introduces the public _to a
new literary personna.

, Editors Dan Edwards and James
Ramsden have assembled a collec-
tion of writers from diverse
backgrounds. Prison poets, writing
professors, _the director of the
International Poetry Forum, stu-
dent writers——they bring interest-
ing (yet sometimes rehashed)
views of the world to the 60
parchment-like pages of the anthol-
ogy. ~ *
Circulated chieﬂy in area college
bookstores (including Pitt's), Crea-

» tive Pittsburgh is based in North
~ Versailles and is currently planning

its August issue.

Pitt readers will be particularly
interested in the sardonic “The
Night of My Prowler”, by Monty

Culver, director of the English

department's writing program.

Those who delighted in Culver’si
. dr‘oll reading at the recent writer’s

conference will appreciate this
story, despite its too thinly veiled.
irony. '

(Two stories with strong ethnic
appeal, James Gallagher's “A Man
of Great Fortune” and Ramsden's
“The Wake for Micky Sullivan,"
go beyond their respective Mexican
and Irish characterizations and

speak to themes of a more
universal nature.

“Beheaded," by the Poetry
Forum's Samuel Hazo, who is

perhaps the-most successful of the
writers assembled herein, is far
and away Creative Pittsburgh’s

best" offering. Offering a brisk
musing on life within a bust being
sculpted, Hazo is typically conver-
sational and witty.

On the trite side are Dan
Klauck’s “The Day Nixon Resign-
ed" and J.A. Magrini’s “The
Hypochondriac." Klauck, howe-
ver, redeems himself with “The

'Guard," an approximately lithe
depiction of a music box ballerina.

G. Ulrich Musinsky's “In Wil-
merding” is a somewhat mournful,
if not overdone, ode to the men of

the mills that neveruxeless is not —

the vast social ownership of steel
through barroom dialogue, culmin-

ating in the. closing santo, “ ‘The
whole ‘valley belongs to the
mills." g A’

Bad Company employs a bare

On the merit of their second visit
to Pittsburgh last night, Bad
Company has emerged as a musical
entity to be reckoned with. Its
members have divorced themsel-
ves completely from the stigmas of
their old bands (Free, Mott the

Pitt Men's Glee Club
Plan EuropeanpTour

BY REGINA RATTIGAN-

The Pope might hear “Hail to
Pitt" when "the Pitt Men's Glee
Club follows its six-day spring tour
of New England, beginning April
28, with a month-long concert tour

of Europe.
Club members Mark Musmanno
and Dan Deely said the 16
. overseas concerts will include

performances at Shakespeare’s
tomb, grammarlschools, the H.J.
Heinz Co. Concert in London, and
the Notre Dame Cathedral. They
also will perform for a Pitt Alumni

gathering in Paris and before the 0

Pope in Rome.

Musmanno, who is involved
mainly with the cultural aspects of
the tour, said part of the program
will have a Bicentennial theme
featuring the music of Stephen
Foster, a native’ Pittsburgher.

album, 2112, made up the majority
of the set, with several old tunes,
“Anthem,” “Workingman” and
“Fly by Night," thrown in for the
die-hards.

Lead guitarist Alex Lifeson_

shows signs of being the next Alvin
Lee. He plays his instrument with
a frothing intensity as his ﬁngers
ﬂy up and down the guitar
fretboard like greased lightning.
Neal “the Professor” Peart is a
gifted drummer, whose imagina-
tive solo during “Workingman”
got the crowds’ adrenalin gushing.

In the past, Rush had a tendency
to turn up the volume up and
merely grind away without discre-
tion. Wednesday, however, it
wisely chose to turn the volume
down, and with the music from
2112 has ﬁnally found a stage show
sense of direction.

“The purpose of this trip is to
spread~American music and cul-
ture," Musmanno explained.

The 45-member Glee Club,
under the direction of Dr. A.
Thomas Caruso, began planning

"for the European trip eight years

ago. Since September 1974, the
club has concentrated its efforts on
raising money.

“The cost of the tour for the club
is $33,000,” Deely, the ﬁnancial
manager, said.

“This includes air fares, land
travels, all meals, tour expenses
and rental fees of concert halls,”
Musmanno added.

“We’ve sold 4,500 Pitt Fight
Song Records and 1,600 Mc-
Donald's Gift Certiﬁcates and did
concerts for high schools, compan-
ies and banquets,” Deely said.

“The trip costs about $1,000 per
person,” Musmanno said. “With
all the funds and endowments, we
have $550 per person. The rest will
be paid by individual members."

Many hosts of the concerts on
the tour required that the Glee
Club send a tape-recorded perfor-
mance for review. One of the tapes
was sent to Italy.

“A man from a music conserva-
tory in Rome called us ‘an excellent
quality group,’ " Musmanno said.

The Glee Club has visited the
east, south and midwest. On its
first foreign tour two years ago,
members of the 86-year-old organ-
ization spent 18 days in Mexico.

“We may have an impromptu‘

concert on the French Rivera at

midnight to echo our concert in’

Acapulco,” Musmanno said.
“We’ve covered most of the United
States, so we’ll be a world
renowned glee club after this
tour.”

‘BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The Pantherette volleyball team
contained enough talented players
to compile the best record the past
two years in women's team sports
at "Pitt.

The line-up was sophomore-
- ﬁlled—from Debbie Jones to
- Debbie Stinner—but it was a

freshman who claimed the Most

Valuable’ Player trophy at the

recent athletics awards banquet,

and no one was more amazed than

‘ Pat “Stretch” Montgomery.

‘'1 was surprised to get MVP

because there are a lot of talented

' _ girls on the team,” Montgomer_

said. A

gomery's enthusiasm as an impet-

“Her desire and effort kind of
motivated us," Stinner said. “She

. “It’s just great,” said Perko,

Both Montgomery and Stinner

7 see little difference in the former’s

collegiate performances compared
to those of her high school career.
‘‘I’d say, primarily, I'm the same
player now as I was in high
school," Montgomery noted. “It’s
a lot tougher playing in college
because in the high schools, there
aren't as many good coaches, so
the teams aren’t as good.”
Montgomery had no complaints
about her coach, Mary Kromer. In

coach at Pitt until her resignation
early this year—a decision that
came as a surprise to her team.
Kromer’s successor has not, as yet,
been named, although Assistant
Athletic Director Sandy Bullman
plans to make the selection soon.

“With Miss Kromer we had a
good coach, and now it’s pretty
much up in the air,” Montgomery
said. “We won’t be able to build a
good program if there's a different
coach every year."

In her rookie season, Montgom-
ery helped the team to an 18-2
record and a trip to the Eastems.

“We were ranked 9th at the
regionals and ended up number
ﬁve," Montgomery said. “It was
nefve-wracking‘ at the beginning,
but after you start playing, it wears
off."

Always a sports enthusiast,
Montgomery didn't originally set
out to be a volleyball player. In
fact, she preferred basketball.
During her freshman year of high

‘school, Montgomery tried out for

the volleyball team but it was two

years before she got around ‘to

joining the basketball team. ,
She shows no regrets about

favoring serving and spiking, even
with the rumor that men will try out
for the Pitt squad next fall because
there is no organized volleyball for
men outside of intramurals.

“We've played against the men
and they're good," Montgomery
admitted. “but they might not be
able to make the team.

“They’r_e tall and able to spike
the ball harder, but they're not .
fundamental ball players."

However you stretch it, Mont-
gomery is one talented volleyball
player, and she's got the trophy to
prove it. \.;~\

They Said It--I Didn't

BY STEVE SYBERT
Associate Sports Editor

In the course of writing some 70
articles since September, it has
been my pleasure to talk with many
outstanding sports ﬁgures-—both
locally and nationally known. I
thought it would be a good idea to
compile a list of what I thought
were the most outstanding (some
even a bit amusing) quotations I
have received. . ~

The following is my version of
“Quotes of the Year—1975-76:”

Coach Leo Bemis when asked
what was in store for the Pitt soccer
team: “We’re going to have to
score some goals this year if we’re
going to win.”

Willie Taylor,'when asked about
his plans for the future: “I just
want to .play football.”

Phil Esposito,.. after his trade
from the Boston Bruins to the New
York Rangers, on the toughest part
of being traded: “Saying good-bye
to the guys was the toughest thing I
ever had to do.”

Pitt hockey coach Len Barcalow,

  Cricket--Most Obscure

BY JIM LEWIS

[This is the last of a series on
obscure sports at Pitt]

An apology is in order.

There are many obscure sports at
Pitt—so many that time and space
didn't permit us to tell you about
them all.

The Rifle Club, Table Tennis
Clyb, Ski Club, Sailing Club, Scuba
Club, Squash Club, Water Polo

‘Team, Racing Team and Synchron-
ized Swimming team are but a few
of the many athletic organizations
that receive very little funding (if

- any) and even less publicity.

But one obscure sport stands‘ out

more (less?) than the rest, thus

earning it the Obscure Sport of the '

Year award. -

Our winner—cricket.

Yes, crickets: n¥ou know, the
sport named after’ the lighter?

If you've never heard of cricket,
don’t be ashamed; very few, if any,
Americans have ever heard of the
game before, let alone been
exposed to it. Cricket is a sport
played primarily in Commonwealth
countries—England, Australia,
and India—-and doesn’t get a
second glance by the United States.

Which is ironic, because every
sunny summer afternoon millions
 of Americans flock to stadiums to

' enjoy its counterpart, baseball. 

Cricket and baseball are very
similar. In both games, the object
is to score runs before the side is
out. Both use some sort of bat,

play by innings, and require the
same basic skills——offense, defen-
se, pitching, speed and strategy.

That is where the similarity
ends. After these, cricket takes on
more interesting and exciting
aspects.

The ﬁeld, an oval or square
approximately 180-200 yards in
length, holds 11 players and a 22
and one-half yard rectangular strip
called “pitch," which is centered
in the middle. One “wicket"—
three wooden poles held together
by “bails,” or wooden braces——are
placed at each end.

Two batters take their place in
front of an individual wicket behind
a line, or “crease,” ready to hit. A
pitcher, or “bowler'," runs from
the ﬁeld onto the pitch, throwing
the small leather ball at the wicket.
if the ball, either by rolling along
the ground or flying through the
air, hits the wicket and knocks off
the bails, th_e batsman is out.

Now the batter can do one_ of
three things; let the ball go by,
praying it doesn’t hit the wicket,
block the ball's path with his bat, or
hit the ball and run like crazy
toward the other wicket.

Both batsmen run from their
individual creases to the opposite
wicket when the ball is hit. If the
ball is caught on a pop ﬁy, the
batter is out. If a ﬁelder picks up
the ball on a grounder and hits the
wicket with his throw before the
batter gets to the crease, the batter
is, also out.

But if both batsmen make it

_ safely to the creases at the opposite

ends, a run is scored. The team
continues to score runs throughout
the inning until the fielding team
gets ten outs. This goes on for two
complete innings. The team with
the highest score wins.

Every summer the Pitt Cricket
Club goes through this format
twelve times against such competi-
tion as Akron, Case-Western
Reserve and Penn State. Some-
times they play at Pitt Stadium. But
it goes unnoticed by the student
body.

This year, however, things will
be different.

“We'll be stronger than last year
for sure," claimed Ajay Madgav-
har, an-‘experienced player-: and

' perhaps the best of the 30-member

club. “We have, a good‘-sized
tearn-.‘"rmm am 0833 ii’ - "

Bat-.nq.:exnsIiessze-~is 1?¢¢llli.F;§-da to
join; anyone. whovis interested» can
participate in the ‘club and ‘its
games. ‘ '

“The games we play aren’t a
matter of life or death," said
Koustubh Oka, a member of the
club. “We keep the spirit of the
game but have fun doing it."

.:~-y.-;: ."

Yes indeed, cricket is a spirited,
exciting, interesting change of
pace. -

Too bad lack of publicity has
hindered its appeal.

before the traditional brawl with
Carnegie-Mellon in December:
“We have gentlemen hockey

"players--rough, but gentlemen.”

Pitt Panther ‘Don Nixon, when’
asked why he became the mascot:
“Everyone gets in goofy moods

and likes to be a total jerk once in a .
' /

while.”

Barcalow, on crowds at the Pitt
hockey games: “We’re still getting
our usual standing-room-only
crowds. There's usually about 10 or
12 people standing, around.”

Ken Dryden, of the Montreal
Canadiens, after saying he’s a
goaltender because .of his» older
brother Dave's inﬂuences: “I’m
sure that's why I am, but I don’t
know why in the. world he is."

Barcalow, again, after his overly
conﬁdent icers suffered a disap-
pointing “Guaranteed Win Day”
defeat to the Duquesne Dukes:
“You. couldn't have gotten our

guys up if you'd used dynamite.”-

‘ Rick Vernon, Pitt hockey captain,
after the upset victory over Penn
State: “I’d like to dedicate this win
to the football players.”

Barcalow——-still again-—on too
many opposing players milling
around in the Pitt goal area:

“There's no way it’s going to look
like the Greyhound terminal and

guys waiting for the bus.”v

Pitt baseball coach Bobby Lewis,
on the season’s opening day rains:
“The farmers write to me so they
know when to plant their seeds.”

National Hockey League referee. ‘
Bruce Hood, when asked how he
got into his profession: “After
you've lost all your marbles, you
become a referee.” 

And last, but not least, Pitt
basketball recruit Sonny Lewis on
his future goals: “If I don’t get a
pro contract, I'll probably ﬁnish
school and get my degree.”

. - Sure, none of these quotes
compare with Richard Nixon's “I
am not a crook," but they were the
best I, could come up with. And
remember, they said it, I didn’t.

WestVirginia Tough,

Tops Panthers, 7-2 

BY JIMMY SPANOS

As the unusually bitter April
wind swept menacingly across the
Trees Hall tennis courts yesterday

evening, Pitt tennis coach George '

Dieffenbach stayed after practice to
play a few games with Scott Luther,
one of his players.

The day before, Pitt had lost to
West Virginia, 7-2, the team's
second loss in a row. Dieffenbach
remained optimistic concerning the
condition of his team, and Luther

, was just glad to be back into the

“starting lineup” as number six
man, replacing Gary Mosso, who
lost first to West Virginia_’s Sam

Moore, 6-2, 6-1, then to Luther in a

challenge match.

Pitt's wins against the Mountain-
eers were turned in by Harry

Habbel in singles (a 7-6, 6-2 winner _—

over Steve Lauria) and by Mike
Habbel and Lou Miller in doubles
(3-6, 6-4, 7-6 winners over Lauria
and Bill Marshall).

In other action, Pitt freshman
Joe Sakalik lost to Dan Haller by-a
6-1. 6-1 score; Mike Habbel lost to.
Dart Meadows, 6-2, 7-6; Dave

Wulkan was defeated by WVU's

/1

Bill Marshall, 6-2, 6-2; and Pitt's
Lou Miller was surprised by Arnold
Rotruck, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. _

Sakalik, Dieffenbach said, “had
a foot injury, hasn't practiced well
in two weeks, and his timing is off.

As a result, it's been mentally
frustrating for him." Miller was
involved in a ‘‘controversial
match" which “affected him
mentally," Mosso “needs more
conﬁdence: and Sakalik, Mosso,
and Wulkan “haven’t been aggres- -
sive enough." said Dieffenbach._
All of which means, accordin§,go ‘ '
Dieffenbach, they've got to start
forcing their opponents into errors
and mak‘e5.}th'em play catch-up
tennis. .

West Virginia, fresh off a tour to
North Carolina where they played
eight‘ matches, ﬁelded a strong
lineup against Pitt, and thus
Dieffenbach hasn't given up hope.

“The kids are good players and
they'll go a long way this year,"
Dieffenbach stated. “I'll be very
happy if we come up with a winning
season." ,.
