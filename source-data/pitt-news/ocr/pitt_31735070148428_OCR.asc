The Backstreet Boys are coming .

to campus — or at leasttheir
songs are.

Various choirs around Pitt’s
campus have their annual win-
ter concerts coming up within
the next few weeks — though
they aren’t necessarily holiday-
themed. Since the beginning
of the school year, the mem-

bers of each group have l.'lad,-

rehearsals each week, many
times adding extra hours on
top of the scheduled meetings.
But for these groups, the prac-
tices mean abetter climax for
their labors.

Ethan Miller, the president
ofC Flat Run, a coed a cappella
group on campus,.said the audi-
ence’s reaction to his g1_'oup’s

The Pitt l\/len’s Glee Club rehearses in Heinz Memorial Chapel for its upcoming concert.

concerts is what entices him to

work hard. He particularly likes _

it when the audience goes crazy
over the group’s renditions of
Backstreet Boys songs.

“I don’t know why, but with
Backstreet Boys,_ they always
do,”_he said. '

And like.the Backstreet Boys,
this group doesn’t just sing.
They’ve got the choreography
down, too. But Miller said that
adding dancing on top of the
singing always proves to be the
most difficult part of preparing
a performance.

He said the 13-member
group doesn’t do the usual
“choir—boy-stand-there—and-
sing” routine when they appear
before their adoring fans.‘Thé
singers go for the contempo-

rary music, and the audience

drives their vigor.
“On their own, they’re both

   

not that bad, but once you have
to start thinking about where
you’re moving while you’re sing-
ing, it gets a bit complicated.
But we are only doing that for
one song, and we know that one
pretty well,” Miller said.

The group plans to keep the
songs seasonally neutral, al-
though it might throw in a well-

‘known Christmas tune.

Regardless, Miller said the
group is ready for its show to-
night at 8 p.m. in the Cathedral
of Learning. .

“This is probably the most
that we’Ve been prepared yet,”

‘he said.

For senior Dexter Gulick,

- president of Pitt Men’s Glee

Club,,getting his a cappella

group prepared can be more _

difficult than fun at times.
“Whenever you  do any-

thing on an instrument, the re-

ally nice thing about it is that
you can hit a button or finger
a note on a string  and you’re

going to get the same note ev—’ .

erytime,” he said. But the same
doesn’t always hold true for
voices, he added.

So from day one, Gulick
said, the group of 55 Pitt men
has had to work hard for a co-
hesive sound. They’ve had to
work on dynamics and phras-
ing, along with figuring out how
many different sounds play in
with each other. But despite
the challenges, sometimes the
large size of the group can be

.a boon.

“It’s also really nice having
such a large group, because the
sound is so full and you can re-
ally do a lot of dynamics, rang-
ing from quiet to bombastically
loud,” Gulick said.

Commuter

Staff Writer

Juniorjason Bigenho has commut-
ed to Pitt since his freshmanyear.
He said the decision to do so was
fairly easy because staying at home
wasn’t a problem for him.

“A lot of students coming out
of high school have this attitude,
‘I can’t wait to get out of here and
get away from my parents.’ I didn’t

have that as a graduating senior,” 7
said Bigenho, who is now president:

of _the Commuter Student Associa-
tion. “It was a lot cheaper for my
parents and for me to commute,
and because I could ride public
transportation for free, it seemed
like it was the best option.”

Between classes, some students
go back to their dorms or nearby
off—campus apartments, but stu-
dents who travel greater distances
to“ campus often visit the Com-
muter Student Lounge in Nordy’s
Place in the William Pitt Union to
relax. Getting to that small lounge
requires planning, however, since
commuters have to grapple with
parking and scheduling around
public transportation.

But the commuters —- whom
Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele speci-
ﬁes as all students who live off
campus — say it’s worth the hassle
when it comes to saving thousands
of dollars.

Saniya Sabnis attested to the
struggle of being a commuter while
preparing for class inside the Com-
muter Student Lounge. She has to

It’s for that sold—out crowd that the
group works, remembering that the‘
audience is waiting for it to perform.
Gulick said it’s not the quality of the
singing that the audience cares about,
but the performance as a whole.

“My motto is that we are not here to
sing well but to make music, and there’s

,a huge distinction between the two,”

he said.
Sophomore Rocky Paterra, the social

if chair of the Heinz Chapel Choir, said

that when his 50-member student group
makes music well, its sound resonates
perfectly in the Heinz Memorial Chapel,
where it always holds its concerts.

“Just the feeling of seeing and hear-
ing all of our hard work pay off is very
fulﬁlling,” Paterra said.

Paterra, who sings tenor in the group,
said the Heinz Chapel Choir’s songs al-
ternate between upbeat and slow and
between religious and nonreligious. '

she _doesn’t feel disconnected, but there are

For example, she often has to schedule

Bigenho said he views extracurricular
meeting times as one of the most common
challenges. Many Pitt clubs meet at inconve-

ally 8:30 p.m. or later. With strict transpor-
tation schedules, commuter students often
have little or no time to participate inthese
after-class activities. . .

“If we could get organizations to meet a
little earlier, we might have happier com-
muters on campus,” Bigenho said.

In early August, ﬁrst—year commuters
had the opportunity to socialize at the an-
nual Commuter Day organized by Commuter
Student Programs. Students were able to

Blazing a New Path

‘Patriot extraordinaire Daniel
Whitaker became theﬁrst person

to make the Tea Party look tame .

when he allegedly drove his Jeep
up Indianapolis’ war memorial
dressed only in cargo shorts and
an American ﬂag, according to
police. At the summit, after deliv-
ering a rant on how our country
was safer 50 years ago, Whitaker
poured gasoline onto the steps
and lit a small ﬁre. Although this
stunt’s sheer American-ness is al-
ready staggefing, we’d like to sug-
gest some improvements for his
inevitable do-over: Blast country
western while driving, eat at least
one hamburger and/or apple pie
en route, and quote at least ﬁve

iCrirn'es of Fashion

Wehope a‘ certain .New York
man at least earned points for

honesty when he struck a police.

car while wearing an “I’m a drunk”
T-shirt. Egregious as his offense
might be, we applaud his choice of
attire: If all criminals woreshirts
announcing their crimes — “I sell

crack cocaine,” “I evade taxes” —

the world would be exponentially
safer.

 Chilly Reception

There’s still no official count
as to how many childhoods were
ruined when police carted off a
man dressed as Frosty the Snow-
man during a Maryland Christmas

parade. The disgruntled holiday
icon, according to The Star Demo-
crat of Easton, landed himself in
a small scuffle with police after
making a joke about their dog.
Although it’s unclear whether his
hat was lost in the struggle, we
maintain that melting is always a
more digniﬁedway out.

' Family Feud

Connecticut officials risked
catalyzing a power struggle when
they accidentally listed James J.
Butler, son of the actual ﬁnance
board candidate, James R. But-
ler, on an election ballot. Butler
senior, who said his son — techni-
cally the winner —-— was uninter-
ested in public office, now awaits
the town committee’s decision
on how to proceed, according to

NBC Connecticut. Fortunately, ‘

this sort of mix-up wouldn’t be a
problem in Pittsburgh: Thus far,

The perils of staying current

with a smartphone

 

Andrew Kaback
Columnist

Last year I decided to throw an
endless party for Miley Cyrus’
18th birthday, so I called up. the
USA and told them we needed
to throw our hands up and move
our hips like yeah, even if it was a
pretty tough climb. Unfortunate-
ly, the planning involved in this
breakout really distracted me
from my pop-culture_updates.
So I hope you’ll forgive me

when I say I didn’t know there I,

was going to be a new iPhone.
When I finally did hear the news,
I thought I could never show my
face in upper-middle-class sub-
urbia again. I might as well have
said something bad about Whole
Foods or forgotten how to pro-
nounce arugula.
I felt left out of the loop. So
in honor of the great Stevejobs,
i I made myself a promise to re-
enter the world of those “in the
know” by constantly checking

my smartphone.
There’s only one drawbackto
all’ of this: People keep telling

’ me that I need to participate in
conversations. I’ll be sitting at

dinner with some friends, look-
ing up the latest Pitt basketball
score, and everyone will act like
I said that “Harry Potter” was
just OK. My table shuns me faster
than an Iranian speech at the U.N.
Give me a break. I’m just trying
to keep up with the times.

This devotion to staying cur-
rent even ruined a recent birth-
day party. It was a weekend to
remember: Some out—of-towners
were present, and gossip was
ﬂying around. I remember put-
t'ing on an extra coat to brace
for the changing seasons and
making a quick snack before I
left. I can vividly recall texting
my planned arrival time and for-
getting where the house was on
my way over. I still feel the cold
metal of the door knob against

my,shaking, frost-bitten hand-

After that, however, my memory

MCT Campus

I goes blank.

Seriously, I don’t know what
happened. From what I could dis-
cern on friends’ social media pag-
es, the following series of events
transpired: I entered the party. I
sat down on the couch. I took out
my phone. I stayed on my phone.
I seem to have found an interest-
ing news story. I looked up new
apps. I discovered a new game on
my phone. I read an old email. I_
kept looking at my phone. I saw
something funny on my phone. I
finished the night staring at my
phone.

I can’t even come up with a
good excuse as to why I can’t
say who was there. I seriously
just played with my phone. The

' entire time.

I expect most people have a
few nights when they can’t quite
remember everything that hap-
pened, although I highly doubt
theirs were caused by a smart-
phone obsession.

I guess there comes a time -

FOOTBALL

Pitt  

Dustin Gabler
Staﬁ'Wri ter

The Pitt football team will meet
Syracuse on Saturday with bowl
eligibility on the line.

Both teams need one more win
in their ﬁnal game of the season
to become bowl eligible with a
6-6 record. Although all teams
that finished over .500 must
be selected for a bowlﬁrst, the
winner of the Panthers-Orange
contest will likely also" receive a
bid. .

Although the Panthers be-
gan this season with hopes of
winning a Big East Champion-
ship and earning a trip to a BCS

game, a win at Heinz Field would -

give Pitt’s seniors —— who will be
honored before the game —- one
last game before the end of their
collegiate careers.

Pitt senior defensive back

Antwuan Reed said his four years
at Pitt passed in the “blink of an
eye.” ,
“I don’t know what I’m going
to be thinking for this last game,”
Reed said. “All I’m worried about
is getting this ‘W.’ I don’t know
what’s going to be going through
my mind.”

Not only would a bowl game
allow the senior class to play an-
other game, the Panthers would
also get 15 practices to prepare for
the bowl and for next season.

-“We got a great bunch of se-

niors that put a lot of hard work —

into this program,” redshirt ju-
nior Jarred Holley. said. “We’re
going to try and send them out
with a ‘W.”’ ‘

In order to pick up their sixth
win, the Panthers will need solid
play from the quarterback posi-
tion. 7

Redshirt junior Tino Sunseri
struggled in the loss to West Vir-
ginia and was sacked 10 times,
including four times on Pitt’s ﬁnal
drive of the game. i

“We didn’t play very well down

the stretch and at the quarter- .

back position, and that is part of
the execution,” head coach Todd
Graham said. “Tino is still the
guy that gives us the best chance
at winning. We just need to get
better.”

Sunseri had the offense roll-’
ing to 17 points in_the ﬁrst half
. against the Mountaineers, but he
couldn’t get his unit moving in the
second half. The Panthers scored
just three points in the ﬁnal two
quarters.
“If you-look at Friday’s game,
' in the ﬁrst half we are executing
down the field. And we missed
things like you would in any
game, but we didn’t play well in
the second half from an execu-
tion standpoint,” Graham said.
“We weren’t executing the reads
in this game very well at all.”
Syracuse head coach Doug
Marrone said he knows that the
Panther offense is inconsistent,
but he planned for the high-
powered offense that Graham’s
system is capable of producing.
“They’ve been able to do a lot
of good things sometimes, and
other times they haven’t had that
consistency,” Marrone said in a
‘weekly press conference. “It’s a

lot like the situation that we’re
in, but they’re a very good foot-
ball team. Offensively, they have
weapons and they’re explosive
at times. It’s a high-octane, fast-
paced type offense-, so we’re going
to have to be ready.”

The Orange are heading to
Heinz Field With dreams of pro-
longing their own season.

“It’s an important game
against a good football team
that’s in the same situation as
far as their record,” Marrone
said. “Obviously in this game,
there’s a lot at stake because if
you win, you get to play another
game. You can start on the foun-
dation of correcting some of the
things that have happened, and
it’s easier to do that on the ﬁeld
than off the field.”

The Orange are led by senior
running back Antwon Bailey, who
has rushed for 998 yards andsix
touchdowns on 222 carries,’,Van
average of 4.5 yards per carry.

nseri‘ was-sacked 10 times against West V i1'ginia. The Panther offense will need
— toimprove in order to defeat Syracuse and become bowl-eligible on Saturday.

 

Senior quarterback Ryan‘Nas-
sib accumulated 2,460 yards

' and 21 touchdowns while _only

throwing seven interceptions. He
connected on 61.6 percent of his
passes. - _

Two of his main targets are
junior wide receiver Alec Lemon
and senior tight end Nick Provo.
Lemon has 60 catches for 735
yards and six touchdowns this
season, while Provo has pulled
in 46 catches for 500 yards and
seven touchdowns.

“Syracuse is a very physical
team and they can run the foot-
ball,” Graham said. “I am very im-
pressed with them defensively.”

Although the Panthers have
struggled this season, Holley
said they are focused on picking

"up a win on the last game of the

regular season. “It’s been a rough
season so far,” Holley said. “But
each and every week we’re bat-
tling, and we’re going to try and
get this win on Saturday.” I

 
   

 

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Taylor
shines
against
Duquesne

Jon Anzur
Staﬁ Writer

Dante Taylor’s play through this sea-

son’s ﬁrst four games exempliﬁed that 

of the Pitt men’s basketball team —— it
was good, but not great.

The center averaged seven points
per game in that four-game stretch
—- which included Pitt’s loss to Long
Beach State, in which he scored two
points and committed four fouls.

Butinwednesday night’s win over
Duquesne, Taylor was perfect.

Literally. J

The junior center shot 6-6 from
the ﬁeld and 3-3 from the foul line

en route to a season—high 15 points. .-:3,

He added 11 rebounds for his ﬁrst
double-double of the year. Taylor’s
dominant performance came in his
ﬁrst game back after he missed the
previous two games because of mi-
graines. — .
“This game was deﬁnitely a con-
ﬁdence builder,” Taylor said after
Wednesday night’s game. “The last
game that I played -— before the two I
missed — I was able to come out and
play with good energr. So to come out

and have another game like that deﬁ- ca

nitely helps me going into Saturday’s
game against Tennessee.”

Pitt head coachjamie Dixon was
especially pleased with Taylor’s play
inwhatwas an overall sloppy game -

the Panthers committed 23 turnovers 6

compared to Duquesne’s 12.
“Dante was terrific,” Dixon said
after Wednesday night’s game. “We

, probably should’ve had the ball in

his hands more since he was the low
turnover guy of the night.”

Taylor received help from his fel- ‘*5

low big men inside this season.
When Taylor was out against
Penn and Robert Morris, the Pan-
thers turned to their bench for sup-
port. Dixon moved freshman Khem

Birch into the starting lineup, and the .

center didn’t disappoint. Birch aver-

‘BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

Three teams can still win the Big East Championship  

R] Sepich

4: A 2 Staﬁ” Writer

After an unpredictable season, the state of the
Big East football championship race is ﬁnally a
little more clear.
Only three teams still have a chance of earn-
ing the conference’s BCS bowl berth. The Louis-
ville Cardinals are in the clubhouse at 5-2,while
both Westvirginia and Cincinnati sit at4-2 and
need to win their ﬁnal games this Saturday to
stay in the race.

With just one crucial week of football left to
play, here are my power rankings of the eight
Big East teams and a breakdown of what the

three schools in contention need to do in order -

to earn a trip to a BCS game.

1. Louisville:TheCardinals (7-5, 5-2 BigEast) P V

earn the top spot in my rankings for the ﬁrst
‘time this season. This team — which has won
ﬁve of its last six games including a 34-24 victory
at South Florida last Friday —- got hot down the
stretch and took advantage of another weak
year in the Big East to clinch at least a share of
the conference title. Head coach Charlie Strong
has a lot of young talent on his hands and will
probably win_Big East Coach of the Year for
his team’s surprising performance this season.

Mountaineers (8-3, 4-2 Big East) managed to
overcome three turnovers to come back from
14-0 deﬁcit and‘ defeat their rival Pitt 21-20 in
what could be the last Backyard Brawl. The vic-
tory keeps West Virginia’s title hopes very much
alive, although the Mountaineers still don’t con-
trol their own destiny. Quarterback Geno Smith

3. Cincinnati: Star quarterback Zach Collaros’
season-ending injury didn’t keep the Bearcats
(8-3, 4-2 Big East) from keepingtheir title hopes
alive, as backup quarterback Munchie Legaux
—- yes, that is his name — led Cincinnati to a
crucial win over Syracuse. Bearcats fans will be
considering a lot of what—ifs should their team
not go to the BCS this year, but for one more

title as the Scarlet Knights (8-4, 4-3 Big East)
ﬁnished their season with a loss at Connecticut.
All things considered, it was still a successﬁil
season for Rutgers. The Scarlet Knights will
most likely play in the Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee
StadiuminNewYork City,.whichwill'practically
be a home game for them. That’s not a bad way
to ﬁnish off a season.

5. Pittsburgh: The Panthers (5-6, 3-3 Big

c East) just 'can’t hold onto a lead. For the fourth

timethis season, Pitt blewadouble-digit lead in
its devastating one-point loss‘ at West Virginia.
Playing four quarters has been a problem for
head coach Todd Graham’s team all season,
and the Backyard Brawl —— when quarterback
Tino Sunseri was sacked 10 times — was the
tipping point for many Panther fans. The future
might look bright, with promising recruits such
as quarterback Chad Voytik anclarunning back

 ‘ Rushel Shellcomingzinto the fold next season,

but this year certainly has been disappointing
for Pitt;

6. Connecticut: There’s no quit in this Con-
necticut (5-6, 3-3 Big East) team. With only a
slim possibility of earning a bowl berth to play
for, UConn stole Rutgers’ BC_S hopes in an im-
pressive 40-22 win. The defending conference
champion didn’t have the season it was hop-
ing for, but if the Huskies can upset Cincinnati

those two games, and sophomore Talib Zarma
averaged nine points and 7.5 rebounds off the
bench. _

Taylor said that his teammates’ performanc-
es motivated him to elevate his own game.

“It deﬁnitely was motivating, because every
day we battle — us three guys and Malcolm
[Gilbert] and Aron [Nwankwo],” he said. “We
ﬁght to get each other better and working hard.
Seeing [Birch and Zanna] come out of the past

two games being able to do good on the inside, '

I deﬁnitely wanted to come back and keep that

up.”
Redshirt sophomore small forward Lamar

I Patterson said that the Panthers have tried to

get their big men more touches.

“We run plays for them to get open looks,”
Patterson said. “We try to open them up off
screens, and we’ve been trying to look to the
post more often —just‘stuff that we should’ve
been doind.”

The Panthers (6-1) will need production
from every player on Saturday when they travel
to Tennessee (3~3) for the Big East/SEC Chal-
lenge. V e

Despite dropping their last game to Oakland,
the Volunteers’ offensive has been potent this

_ season, averaging 84.7 points per game.Four

of the Volunteers’ ﬁve starters are averaging

double ﬁgures.

Patterson said that Tenn'essee’s depth dis-
tinguishes this year’s team from the squad that
upset the then thirdrranked Panthers at the

. Consol Energy Center last season.

‘.‘We really don’t know who their main guy
is,” Patterson said. “Last year, Ifeel like we knew
who their main guy was. Butthis year they have
a few guys who can cause a problem.”

Tennessee point guard Trae Golden could
cause the Panthers the most trouble. ,

. Not only is Golden averaging 17 points and
six assists per game, but Pitt starting point

guard Tray Woodall’s status for Saturday is
uncertain. _

Woodall, who was injured late in the
Duquesne game,‘ did not practice Wednesday.
Dixon said the team is waiting on Woodall’s MRI
results before “making any decisions or calls”
on his availability for Saturday. ‘

If Woodall can’t play, Dixon said redshirt
freshman Cameron Wright and freshmanjohn
Johnson will play more minutes.

Former Panther Dwight Miller—who trans‘-
ferred to Midland College (Texas) last year af-

ter two seasons at Pitt — is in his ﬁrst year as‘

a Volunteer after transferring from Midland

, College.

Miller redshirted his freshman year before
playing in 16 games for the Panthers in 2009
and 2010. He even sangjamie Foxx’s “Wedding

Song” at Pitt assistant coach Brandin Kriight’s ‘ 

wedding.

Dixon called Miller a “great kid,” saying,
“The University of Pittsburghwas abetter place
when he was here.” 3;

conference, they could at least take solace in
the fact that they had another winning season
- in the Big East.
7. South Florida: By falling for the sixth time
in seven games against Louisville, the’Bul1s (5-6,
a 1-5 Big East) essentially ended their hopes of
reaching abowl game this season. South Florida
started 4-0 with high hopes of actuallywinning
the conference, but since its spanking at Pitt on
a Thursday night at the end of September, this
teamjust hasn’t gotten its mojo back. South-
Florida is just another team whose fans will be
scratchingtheir headsand thinking aboutwhat—
ifs heading into the off—season. .
8. Syracuse: The Orange (5-6, 1-5 Big East)
fell in their fourth consecutive defeat at home
against Cincinnati last week, and this looks like
a team that has just given up. Hopes were high
for Syracuse after it blew out West Virginia in
its only conference win, but the Orange have
just fallen apart down the stretch: The team
will ﬁnish up its season at Pitt this Saturday in
a battle of two teamslthat each need a sixth win
to earn bowl eligibility. '
Offensive Player of the Week: Teddy Bridge-
water, Louisville, quarterback ’— The freshman
is a big reason why the Louisville team is where
it is. His talent is unquestionable, but it’s been
his composure and leadership that has led the
Cardinals to 5-2 in conference play. Down 17-3

the Cardinals stormed back against the Bulls to
cement their share of the Big East title. _
Defensive Player of the Week: Julian Miller,
West Virginia, defensive end — Coming into the
Backyard Brawl with only twosacks all season,

Millerdecided he wanted to take advantage

of Pitt’s tendency to give up plenty of sacks.
He did just that. The senior defender was all
over Panther quarterback Sunseri in Friday’s
Mountaineer victory, and he tallied four sacks
as Sunseri went down a total of 10 times.
Coach of the Week: Charlie Strong, Louisville

_ — Winning on the road is never easy, especially

with a young team, but that is'just what Strong
and his Cardinals did at Connecticut and South
Florida over the last two weeks. Aiteralackluster

-v I performance against Pitt at home three weeks

ago, Louisville clinched at least a_ share of the Big
East following those impressive back-to—back
' road victories.

What to watch for in Week 14: Race for the
BCS — As itldoes almost every year in the Big
East, determining a conference champion has
come down to the last weekend. West Virginia
will travel to South Florida and Cincinnati hosts
Connecticut in the two games that will deter-
mine the Big'East champion. Unless of course
the Mountaineers and Bearcats both win, in
which case the BCS computers will use math to
determine which team presumably earns aberth
