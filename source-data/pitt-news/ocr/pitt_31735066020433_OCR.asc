computer analysts, Robison was
able to identify districts with over 80
percent Democratic registration,
and the group was able to conduct
intensive canvassing efforts based
on these targeted results.
According to Behrend, most of
the canvassing‘ efforts have been
conducted in white, working-class

these voters against Reagan.

Port Authority Transit is looking for a new
transit tax that ‘hopefully will lower fares and '
improve services  See page 4. '

A proposal‘ foi Student Task ‘
. Force to evaluate the bus lane prob-

lem on Pitt’s campus was passed yes-
terday at the Student Government
Board meeting.

Board "member Avery Abrams
made the proposal and said the task
force would be divided into two
parts. The first part would be the
political end involving the city coun-
cil,"’ Abrams said. This would
include the enforcement of the l5
miles per hour speed limit for buses
on the Pitt campus and question the
city’s reluctance to install beepers in
the buses that go through Pitt's cam-
pus. The second part of the task

force would involve an awareness‘

-program on campus in which the
Freshman Council would
participate.

Abrams said he is planning an
awareness radio program to be aired
on WPT.S, in conjunction with the
Public Safety Council, Office of
Residence Life, Port Authority
Transit and students. '

Abrams'also met with the Office

of Residence Life about visitation,

policies designated for studyhours

. and is working with the Resident

Student Association on a written

i Proposal. “Sunday and Wednesday

  Democrats take PA?  

would be an extended period for vis-
itation for study with the roommates
permission,” Abrams said.

In other business, board member
John Geyer said he plans to petition

said he is continuing in his efforts to --

extendj library hours during mid-_~

terms and finals.

Johna Winters, Mary Jogodich
and Jim Mu_mma were appointed to
the Academic Integrity Affairs
Committee by board member Bob
Kramer.

John Leopold, chairman of the
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee, said that a voter registration

drive will take place next week?‘ We ‘
want to register more voters than ‘

ever before," he said.

The board passed two requests by
the Allocations Committee. The Pitt
Ski Club is getting a loan of $2,200
for their Vermont ski trip with the
stipulation that it will be paid back,

According to allocations member
Keith Christian, the Ski Club also
got a 10 percent increase in the cov-
erage of their bus costs.“ SGB will
now pay for 50 percent of the bus
cost rather than the previous 40 per-
cent, to insure that the cost willgnot
prohibit their trip.“.

The College Young Democrats

were allocated $732.38 for four
members to attend a convention.
Elections Committee member Jim
Glass announced that applications
for Student
president and members will be avail-
able beginning Monday, September
24. Elections will be held October 3]
through November 1. ’

Speedof buses    
may be checked   J

The city’s planning director has
recommended that city police use a
VASCAR speed detection device to
check the speed of buses travelling
along the controversial Fifth
Avenue bus lane. ‘-

Robert Lurcott, city planning
director, made the recommendation
this week in a letter to police super-
intendent Robert Coll. A 20-mph
speed limit would be posted for the
bus lane and VASCAR enforcement
would be used to insure drivers keep
to that speed limit.

In another development this
week, the Port Authority
announced that at least two of its

and 61B Swissvale — will shift their

bus routes — the 61A Wilkinsburg.

outbound route from the Fifth
Avenue bus lane to Forbes Avenue.

That will reduce the numberiof
bus trips on the bus lane from 514
trips now to about 400 in mid-

November. However, PAT officials" -‘

consider the contraflow lane on
Fifth Avenue a success in relieving

traffic congestion and do not want “

to shift all eastbound bus routes
back to Forbes Avenu_e.

The announcement of the route
switches came at a meeting Tuesday
morning involving officials of PAT,
the city planning and traffic depart-
ments, Oakland businessmen and
representatives ~- of Oakland com-'
munity groups.

BANGKOK, Thailand (UPI) -
“Bathtub disease,” an ailment fre-
quently contracted in Bangkok’s
well-known massage parlors where a
long, luxurious bath and scrubdown
are included in the price of services,
is on the rise. Nation Review said
bathtub disease is “caused by exces-
sive acid in shampoo and. bathing
soap.” Bangkok health officials said
the best way to avoid the problem is
to “stop visiting massage parlors.”

PEKING (UPI) — An obscure
town in central China is a hotbed of
button repair. The official Chinese

news agency said farmers in a village _

in a central coastal province rec_ently
began_ picking up discarded buttons
from a recycling factory nearby.
They were able to sell them with no
trouble, and within a short. time,
other villages began repairing but-
tons. The area has since turned into
the nation’s biggest wholesale center
for buttons.

PHILADELPHIA (UPI) --
“Aarthur,” a three-pound aardvark,
was born at the Philadelphia Zoo on
Wednesday. Although zoo officials
were excited, Aarthur’s mother was
not impressed. A zoo spokeswoman
said the mother has been ignoring
her baby. .

BEIRUT —— (UPI) A pro-Iranian
suicide mission against the U.S.
embassy in Beirut left 23 people
dead early yesterday morning. Two
American servicemen lost their lives
and five were wounded in the attack
when two terrorists drove a truck
loaded with explosives through a
hail of gunfire. The explosion dug a
crater seven feet deep outside the
embassy building. ‘

~ ‘WASHINGTON (UPI) — u.s.

Secretary of Defense Caspar Wein-

berger is preparing our response t_o

the Beirut blast. Weinberger said
yesterday, “We do not intend to
allow anyterrorist acts to interfere
with our operations.” I

WASHINGTON (UPI) — Presi-
dent Reagan said yesterday that if
he’s -reelected, he will renominate
Edwin Meese to the post of attorney

, general when Congress reconvenes

in,.lanuary. Reagan said he is “not
surprised” with the outcome of the
probe into the financial dealings of
his long-time friend. A special prose-
cutor issued a 385-page report clear-
ing Meese of any wrongdoing.

FLORIDA (UPI) — James
Dupree Henry became the ninth
man to die in Florida’s electric chair
since capital punishment was re-
stored in 1976. The 34-year-old man
was sentenced to death for murder-
ing an elderly civil rights leader dur-
ing a robbery l0 years ago. Henry
went to his death trembling and pro-
fessing his innocence.

(UPI) —- Both vice presidential
candidates were confronted by boos
and jeers yesterday on the campaign
trail. Vice President Bush, in Brat-
tleboro, Vt., was drowned out by
nuclear freeze advocates as he

~ sought to deliver a speech reaffirm-

ing President Reagan’s commitment

t0 arms control. He was interrupted ,

by chants of “Dump Reagan-Bush.”
The heckling forced Bush to drop
the bulk of his prepared speech on
arms control.

In Arlington, Texas, Geraldine
Ferraro also was heckled when she
tried to -lambast Reagan at a rally at
the University, of Texas. The vice
presidential nominee was repeatedly
interrupted by shouts of ‘—‘four more

years" and “Reagan." One heckler »

shouted: “Go back to the kitchen.”

The Pitt News, Priday, Septeriiber '21, 

By Ann Clfra
The Pitt News '

According to Gina Squire,
mechanical engineer for Pitt’s
Physical Plant, Pitt students
need not worry about asbestos
warning signs at the«Cathedral
lawn construction site. Squire
said the signs are only
cautionary.

Squire, who helped supervise
the removal of the asbestos insu-
lation of steam pipes being
replaced at the site, said that all
asbestos material has now been
removed from the area.

The removal took place during
the past two weeks and, accord-
ing to Squire, no asbestos con-
tamination was present in the air
inside or outside of the work
area.

The steam pipeline was in poor
condition prior to construction.
After completion of construc-
tion, the pipeline will be con-

~ tained within a seven-foot high
concrete tunnel that will give
maintenance workers access to
the line. The pipeline currently
supplies the upper part of Pitt's

and area hospitals. -

The asbestos insulation of the
pipes had to be replaced to
comply with EPA and Allegheny
Public Health Department regu-
lations. Squire explained that no
health hazards were present
prior to replacement because the

Asbestos
removal

campus, including the Cathedral

insulation was underground
where it could not pose a
problem. ,

All of the removal work, she
said, was completed satisfactori-
ly. The asbestos was removed
within a plastic tent that con-
tained all of the asbestos dust.
Air samples were taken daily
from inside the workers‘ clean
room and from both inside and
outside the work area. At no time
did the air samples indicate any
hazard. Squire analyzed the
work of the asbestos testing con-
tractor and inspected the job
setup while the air samples were
being taken. She expressed con-.
fidence that all testingwas done
adequately. Work would have
been stopped, she added, had the
air samples been unclean. The
university's plans for removal,
according to Squire, were “very
much above and beyond” the
required standards.

Joe Pollino, construction fore- ,
man of Massaro Corp. contrac-
tors, said no contamination
danger was presented to pas-
sersby of the site, and workers’
safety was ensured under Occu-
pational Health and Safety
Agency regulations.

The only problem hindering
construction was the presence of
undetected underground utility
lines,’ particularly telephone
lines. Bell Telephone had to be
consulted for the adjustment of
one line that provides service to
the entire campus. Squire says
that work is proceeding as sche-
duled, however.

Have you ever wondered how a

working parent or travelling sales-'

man attends college with an erratic
schedule? The University External

Studies Program enables these indi- '

viduals and others who have physi-
calor time limitations to continue
their educations.

External Studies students receive
instruction through study guides
which replace weekly lectures. They
also must attend three Saturday
workshops. Students read, do
assignments, and take supervised
exams at their convenience. Grades
are based on papers, tests and
improvement. I

Fiore Pugliano, instructor of
Basic 'Writing and Written Profes-
sional Communication in the
(UESP) External Studies Program
and CAS said, “I try to make the
courses as close to the courses on
campus as possible.” He finds this

_ possible in Written Professional.

Communication, but admits that he
must adjust his thinking for Basic
Writing. Publiano said, “Because we
don’t meet weekly, I don’t have the
time in class to go over things...l

. encourage students to come in for

personal conferences.”

The External Studies Program is
a division of the College of General
Studies. It offers complete majors in
Public Administration, Psychology,
Social’ Science Concentration and
Ecomonics.. History, Sociology and
Administration of Justice degrees
can be completed with several CGS
courses.

Mike Spring, head of the University External Studies Program

Enrollment within this program is

approximately 2,000. The majority"

of students are full-time employees,
many are married. Ages range from
I6 to 90., .

Michael Spring, director of the
program said, “The majority of stu-
dents take classes through External
Studies because of a time constraint;
there are .a few handicapped
students.” .

The External Studies Program
was conceived in 1972 by J. Steele [
Gow, former dean of CGS. It arose .
from a desire to open education to
adults, and to apply reasearch ofthe
LRDC (Learning Resource Devel- 
opment Center). As Pitt became a I
state-related school and the pro-
gram saw the interest of the state.
Applications of technology are
being investigated.

expensive mass transit systems in the country. PAT used may Editor, » Pitt students senselessly hurt.

to offer university students the generous U-Pass. The
pass was sold in booklets containing 25 tickets for $15 per
booklet. The tickets were honored in lieu of the one-
dollar fare. They also allowed the rider a zone transfer at
no extra fee. The present form ofthe U-Pass, now 20 for
$15, no longer allows one to receive a free transfer. That
now costs a quarter.

PAT has also offered a reduced price to students for
their monthly bus passes. The general monthly pass costs
$40. The student version costs $35 plus 10 cents for each

ride. But now there is talk of eliminating student fares
altogether. ‘

PAT has been a continuous headache for the city, but i

now there is light at the end of the tunnel. Recently the
system has been bouyed by some innovative (pronounced
tT1C_kY) b00kkeepmg. They are presently, if only_tempo-
rarily, solvent. There is now talk of imposing a transit
tax, yvhich would most likely.be an extra cent on the
state s six-cent sales tax or a slight jump in the personal
income tax, at least for residents of Allegheny County
The tax may or may not result in lower fares, but it
certainly would be a less obvious way for PAT to increase
its revenues rather than continuously increasing its fares.
Most major cities have such transit taxes. Philadelphia‘
and Pittsburgh do not. If this tax would noticeably
-improve the system, there can be little objection to it. But
PAT s past ‘performance has given them a reputation for

’ Philadelpliia’s drivers are paid approximately $10 an

more than $12.

The system itself shuts down entirely too early; most of

thebuses are off the r_oad by 12:30 am. Anyone who

Wish the proposed tax, if passed, would allow PAT to

Ordinarily, I_ would never even
have answered Linda McDonald's
letter, but she wrote so cleverly and I
have heard so many hostile com-
ments about students crossing the
streets that I feel compelled to write
because of the harm the attitude of
“cars vs. pedestrians” can cause. I
can’t believe so many people, like

‘Linda McDonald and Jerry

Kowalski from Residence Life, are
still so wrapped up in pointing fin-

gers, in worrying about “who’s to ,

blame.” The bottom line is that three
people have been sent to the hospi-
tal. Instead of worrying about who
was right or wrong, the question
should be: What are we going‘to do
about it? The university’s cold, legal
detachment from our problem
continues.

As Kowalski was quoted on Wed-
nesday, “For me, it is just a real-ity to
contend with.” Kowalski’s and Ms.
McDonald's comments are repre-
sentative of a very unfortunate atti-
tude toward the three students’
tragic accidents this term. Theirs is
an attitude that shuts their eyes to
the human suffering involved and
worries about right and wrong and
the statistical and legal problems of
our “urban environment.” l have
worked in the hospitals here since
my freshman year and have spent

time in them as a patient and as ‘

volunteer. Right and wrong do not
matter when they bring the “train-
wrecks" into the emergency room.
“Just a reality to contend _with" does
little to console a mother crying
while her child’s life slips away. The
hospital is a very lonely place at 3
a.m. The quiet is broken only by the
a&b monitors and any occasional
sob. Sleep is kept away by the horri-

From where I stand/ Timothy Hunter

Qpjnions   0

Two rather ludicrous statements
were in the news recently. The first
was made by a member of the
Democratic Party, the second by the
Communist Party.

V “They won’t be able to use me; I'm
tough and I know what I’m doing.”
After reading such a quote, a vision
comes to mind of Barney Fife trying
to get permission from Andy Grif-
fith to put his one bullet in his pistol.

Actually, this statement, as
reported by Monday’s issue of USA
Today, was made by the Democratic
Party’s presidential candidate, Fritz
Mondale. He was setting up his last
attempt to win support from the
American public. ,

This attempt, of course, .will take
place when he meets with Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
on Sept. 27, the day before Ronald
Reagan's scheduled meeting with
the Soviet minister.

Fritz‘ little attempt will backfire
on him, though, for he will show the

American public his hypocritical, or
at least misguided, ways.

In the USA Today’s article, Fritz
further states: “We [Americans]
refuse to make the possibility of
peace a casualty ofthis or any other
political campaign.” Fritz is doing
just that; his only gain by meeting
with Gromyko is political — putting
himself into the limelight.

The second statement, by Soviet
journalist and one-time defector
Oleg G. Bitov, was reported by The
New York Times on Wednesday.
Bitov was explaining how he didn’t
actually defect from the Soviet
Union but was captured by British
spies.

“As I returned to my hotel late at
night on Sept. 8, 1983, I took my
key, as usual, at the desk, crossed the
street to reach my villa, rang the

. doorbell and, as the buzzer sounded

at the hotel's main building, the door
opened, but there was no light that
time for some reason. I paid no

attention and stepped forward into
the darkness only to get ‘a terrible
blow at the back of my head."

The New York Times also wrote
that Bitov said that “this was fol-
lowed by a period of semiconscious-
ness —— psychotropic injections did
their job well —- and a flight from
Pisa to London with a forged British
passport in the name of David
Locke."

Bitov read this prepared state-
ment at a Soviet press conference.
Contrary to what the Soviets say, he
did not write the statement. The

. author of the statement must have at

one time worked on a JameslBond
movie or even the Maxwell Smart
television series. '

The New York Times also wrote I

that Bitov returned to the Soviet
Union without certain important
personal items such as his car and a
sum of money.

   

    
  

g So far left they’re out of the country

Mr. Hart-Davis, a British writer
who worked with Bitov, was quoted
in The New York Times last week-
end: “It should be emphasized that
neither I nor anyone else who met
him [Bitov] in England has the
slightest doubt that he defected
voluntarily. Even if he now surfaces
in Moscow and claims that he was
kidnapped in Venice by the CIA or
writes something to this effect in an
article, I shall know it's a lie.”

The Soviets are obviously
attempting to make us, the good
guys, look like bad guys. However,
their attempt will backfire on them
just as it did while they were explain-

. ing their pulling out ofthe Olympics.

Newsweek's May 28 issue best
describes the Soviets’ Olympic bum-
blings: “Employing classic cold war
rhetoric, Gramov had accused the
Reagan administration of conspir-
ing to kidnap Soviet athletes and
inject ' them with "psychotropic

chemicals to affect the nervous sys-.f_
tem.’ If Uberroth [L.A. ‘Olympic,
Organizing Committee Chief] were-; 4
an experienced diplomat or an old.
vaudevillian, he would have simply‘ 5;

 

paused for the inevitable laughter; 
instead, he lashed back with unchar-.5 

acteristic anger, calling the charge-
‘an insult to the American people.’ ”f ‘

~;

I

The Soviets must think ,_we are a_. 
bunch of anesthesiologists with all}

the drugs we are supposed

to be: if

administering." » g; 

The Soviet pullout from the;-vi
Olympics was totally . unnecessary.‘

but it was not very surprising; just as I
the American Olympic pullout was.C._;

not very surprising while a Demo-f.—_E

crat was in office.

I'm not trying to suggest sanyff
correlations between Soviets and;

Democrats, but the statement made
by Reagan that “the Democrats.

have gone so far left, they've left the . 
country,” does seem to be more and - 

more true every day.

Pitt’s Biology Department held its"
first Awards Banquet yesterday
honoring students who demon-
strated outstanding scholastic
achievement.

Biology Department Chairman.
Dr. A. Chung suggested last year
that the department give special
recognition to outstanding students
of first year biology courses. Eleven
students were selected out of more
than 800 applicants. The decision
was based on the students’ biology

Outstand

grades and their overall QPAS for
their first three terms.

Assistant Chairman Dr. James
Franzen presented the awards, say-
ing that he hoped this would encour-
age students to continue in the
biology program. Each student
received a scientific calculator, a
subscription to Science 84, and a
Certificate of Achievement signed
by Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Jerome L. Rosenberg and Dr.
Chung. A

After the awards presentation,
Dr. Chung added his congratula-
tions, commenting on the enormous
advances made in the last l0 or 15
years in the biological sciences.

PITTSBURGH (UPI) — It’s offi-
cially over. Michael Jackson and the
Victory Tour will not be coming to
Three Rivers Stadium Oct. 13 and
14 because of a union dispute over
novelty sales at the concert, City
Stadium Authority Chairman
George Whitmer announced yester-
day. The cancelation came despite
an eleventh-hour attempt by Mayor
Caliguiri to resolve the impasse.
Union vendors hold exclusive rights

_,to sell novelties at the stadium, but

the Jackson Tour promoters insist
they control the sales at all concerts.
The vendors last week refused a buy-
out offer of $1,000 each to sit out the
two concerts. Caliguiri offered to
raise that to $1,750 each to keep the
concert but the union leadership did

not call for a vote on the proposal,
leading to the official cancellation.
The Post-Gazette reported in
today’s edition that Chicago is
rumored to be ‘taking Pittsburgh’s
place on the tour.

they expect to see at the polls. The
present canvassing efforts are
focused on registering voters but
after Oct. 8, the final day of voter
registration, the Democratic organi-
zations will refocus their efforts
toward making over 20,000 phone
calls reminding those registered to
vote, and they will also provide
transportation to anyone unable to
reach the polls. ,

V So far the Democratic campaign
in Pittsburgh has not, according to

. Behrend, been affected by the disu-

nity plaguing the national Demo-
cratic campaign earlier
election. This disunity, along with
the nation’s improving economy, the
series of inquisitions made on
Democratic vice ‘presidential candi-
date Geraldine Ferraro, and Mon-
dale’s difficulty in combating

Reagan’s- slick ‘Showmanship, have_

not brought the Democrats any
closer to victory in November.
State camnaaign director John
O’Leary said that the campaign will
definitely intensify in the next two
weeks. ‘

Repo Man, the latest visual endeavor
from ex-Monkee Michael Nesmith,

 pushes the reputation of B-movies to
. the brink of art.

Harry Dean Sta-nton stars as Bud,

l-an aging,..hard-nosed repo man who

recruits an unsuspecting punker
named Otto and introduces him to
the fast—moving, thrill-packed perils
'of the trade. The world of the repo-

’ 1 man is one of ‘the bizarre, populated

a sense of humor, both subtle and

lost. He replies. _ » ,

"Bullshit. You're just a white sub-
urban punk like me."

The remarkably tight script by
Alex Cox is lined with parody, wield-
ing its sardonic sword at the punk
scene, suburban life, child-rearing,
obsession, violence all handled
with a wit and quirkiness reminiscent

.of early Woody Allen.

The film's most tense
moments are skillfully balanced
with a sense of humor, both sub-
tle and blatant.

Complimenting the fine screenplay
is equally impressive cinematography
aided undoubtedly by the fact that
most (if not all) of the scenes were
shot on location rather than on the
back lot of some plasticine .set con-
structed for TV movies. Environ-
mental authenticity is a dominant
impression, a key factor in the crea-

tion of a rich background for the N

actors. _
The ensemble acting in Repo Man is
competent, the actors playingwell off
each other, none emerging as a stand-
out- star no_r faltering as a hopeles-s
secondary. From Emilio Esteves' por-
trayal-_of the inquisitive Otto to the

wigged-out madman/bum named‘
»Miller, the performances are

engrossing. ‘

Otto: You don't even know how to

With rationale like that coupled
with an infectiously wrenching title

The Dwarf falls short 

L By Stan Thomas Wozniak

What to make of this little demon-L

stration of American film called The
Dwarf that choreographsthe death
waltz of a midget named Murphy?
Well, not much, really. What might
have been a careful and ulnique'char-

acterization of the life of a dwarf is -

reduced to an insane attempt ‘at
recapturing "European cinema in New
York City. 7

Director Richard Monteverde, a
Pittsburgh-born Duq_uesne Univer:
sity graduate, haslobviously mistaken
his formula for directing and writing
documentaries (which he is famous
for) with that which requires more
intensity in a feature-length film.
Throughout the awkwardly’ edited
scenes in The Dwarf, the audience
seemed to stir uncomfortably ‘as if
waiting for a commercial. _

The story is simple. Murphy is a
delivery boy for Nick's Market in the
Soho section of New York City. On

~ the streets, he is under the constant

humiliation of a‘ street gang that
pursues him and eventually ends up

murdering his boss after a break-in. _

.At home, in the-basement apartment,

. he escapes the real world by playing
— old "605 music and reviving it through

his "magical band," a group of" three
mannequins. After learning of the
murder of his boss and best friend, he
seeks advice from a customer he's
developed a ‘surprising friendship
with, anattractive ‘fashion designer,
Kate. He moves in with.‘ Kate tq.

Aescgapel-~har'rnp from the street gang but  

.__hum.a[n,i
 .  7

As “Murphy, stage and television
actor Bobby Faust plays the part as if
he were given a copy of the script a

I week before filming-‘started. At times

he's emotional and endearing, but we
never even begin to feel sympathy for
him as a human being, much less one

The supporting cast, Ann Magnuson I

as Kate and Frank Bongiorno as Mur-
phy’s’ boss, fare even worse‘. They
seem to be standing around waiting
for something to happen. Unfortu-
nately, it never does. .

Writer-producer-director Richard
Monteverde's debut in feature film is
not very promising. It does seem,
however, that Monteverde's- The
Dwarf was a’ one-take movie. Had it
not been, the results mights have
been a little more invigorating since
there is a sense that he trusted’ the
material enoughltopresent it without
apology. But a film about a handi-
capped individual isn't
"Rocky" until ‘we can get him in‘ the
ring. ~~

Particularly disappointing is the
climax of The Dwarf. It's a puzzling

scene in which Murphy is chased in
one final confrontation with the I

hoods. Washed out by’ awful"back-
ground music (most of the film is),
the scene is almost unbearable to
watch. Monteverde confesses: ."I
wanted to incorporate the fantasy
elements of Fellini, the bizarre visuals
of Kubrick and the sensitivity of Zeff-

ferelli." Well, for Monteverde, Iguess

By Paul Anderson

Rock ’n’ roll. Loud. Young. Bent
on changing the world. The deliv-
ery from a thousand unfulfilled
dreams. A means by which an
entire generation could express its
search for identity. But like all good
things, rock was exploited. Explo-
ited not just from the outside by
greedy record industry types, but
from the inside. The performers
saw the mass fortunes available and
sold out. True rock ’n’ roll exists; it
just rarely has the mass appeal
(read "teen appeal”) required to sell
platinum records. Rock ’n’ roll is
out of the hands of those (youth) .
who invented it.

But wait. There is one performer
who still sees hope in the medium
and refuses to compromise. Para-
doxically, his deep integrity is the
key to his widespread, yet still

Springsteen's popularity has
never depended on the fads and
fashions of the time.

cult-like, appeal.~If~you’re lucky,
you'll be seeing him this weekend
performing what may be the most
exciting example of rock ’n’ roll

' theater to come through Pittsburg

in some time. A
Bruce Springsteen is the purest
example of rock ’n’ roll in its
highest stage to ever reach mass
popularity. His popularity has never
depended on the fads and fashion
of the time. Instead, he earns the
admiration and respect of his fans
by releasing uncompromising classic
albums and living up to his own
high standards in concert. Cur-
rently in the midst of this year's
most exciting tour, Springsteen has
come a long way since one of rock's
pre—eminent critics wrote after see-
ing him in concert in 1974, "I have

‘seen the future of rock and roll and

its name is Bruce Springsteen.”

Having released his seventh
album in eleven years, Spring-
steen"s music stands bigger than
life as his new songs take on the
proportions of anthems and moti-
vating sermons instead of mere
songs. He has put the guitar way
out front and created melodies that
last while still singing as though his
life depended on it. s

The centerpiece of Born In the
USA is titled "No Surrender." In it,
Springsteen states in no uncertain
terms the healing power of rock.
He views rock as "the Great Moti-
vator." No one can retreat on their
basic values; if they do, they have
sold their life short. In the songs,
he reminds us over and over, "We
made a promise we swore we'd
always remember, no retreat no
surrenderl like soldiers in the win-
ter's night with a vow to defend,
no retreat no surrender." The

album is a highly inspirational work i

that rivets the listener to act.

"Rock and roll, man, it changed
my life. It was like the 'Voice of
America,’ the real America  It was
the liberating, the out, the key out
of the pits. Once I found the guitar,
I had the key to the highway!”

On his current tour, Springsteen
is living up to all the expectations
thrust upon him. He is rock ’n’ roll
in the flesh. No pretentious light
shows, lasers or fog banks. No
flashy, excessive guitar masturba-
tion. Springsteen offers music with
the bottom line necessities: energy,
immediacy, honesty and hope.

”Serious” critics have fallen prey
to the phenomenon. Ed Skiaky
from WMMR—FM in Philadelphia
calls him ”the most exciting thing
to happen to rock and roll ever.”
He views Springsteen as the "single
most magnetic, most believable
actor—singer-musician you'll ever
see  he makes you laugh and cry
and scream your head off as he
makes his songs  come to life."
For over three hours, Bruce
Springsteen and the mighty E
Street Band give up every ounce of
energy they have and play with the
abandon of the most energetic
garage or hardcore band. Clarence
Clemons, easily the greatest saxo-
phonist in rock history, plays off of
the Boss beautifully. Springsteen
returns the admiration and gives
Clarence a reverent introduction.

He calls the Big Man such things as‘

"The Master of the Universe,” "The

_ steen is living up to all the expec-

tations thrust upon'him. He is

King of the World,” and spews off
a list of titles as the crowd lets
Clarence know just how great he
is. Although Miami Steve Van
Zandt is no longer with the band
because of his devotion to his
mighty pack of rock crusaders, The

Disciples of Soul, the spot of guita- ’

rist has been filled by no less a
heavyweight, Nils Lofgren.

Lofgren slithers around stage and
plays off of Springsteen's enthusi-
asm quite readily. Max Weinberg
maintains the mightiest beat known
to Western man while Roy Bittan
provides a deft harmonic back- I
ground on his Steinway grand
piano. ,

But as expected, Springsteen
owns the show. He proves himself
to be every bit as charismatic as

A Elvis (although he would certainly

refuse to be compared to his idol).
He runs around stage, even singing
to the people behind the stage,
trying to let everyone in on the
goings-on. He leads the band
through such rousing rave-ups as
"Twist and Shout," "Who'll Stop
the Rain," "Street Fighting Man”
and any of a huge collection of rock
standards the band has been known
to perform.

The concerts def-y classification
or understanding, but Miami Steve
once described Bruce's drive quite
simply: "He does every show like it
was his last. He lives every minute
like it was his last. That's the way
to Iive.” " ’ «

About being a celebrity, Spring-
steen once said, "Being a rock star,
that's the booby prize. Me, I set out
to be a rock and roller.” His
concerts always reach epic propor-
tions in energy and length, which
prompted him to tell a writer,
"Everything has been so faithless,
and people have been shown such
disrespect. You want to show peo-
ple that somehow, somewhere,
somebody can  I guess you-just
don't want to let them down.”

Bruce Springsteen overflows
with energy." This is the energy
that rock once had, wild, free and
full of hope. Through his seven
albums he has traveled down many
musical paths, never hitting a dead
end. Although the "albums vary
widely in scope, style, maturity and
vision, they all assert the same
premise.

For Bruce Springsteen, life is
rock ’n’ roll. _

 

COVER
Tom Verlaine

' Virgin

Back in 1977, Tom Verlaine
then of the band Television, was

"_heralded as the author of the

most innovative rock guitar
style of the new wave. Six

"albums and seven years later,

the statement still stands.

His new record is yet another
example of that quality that
send-s critics into ecstasy and
guitarists into their bedrooms
with: headscratching frustra-
tion. He's not all that fast. He’
doesn't use a. mind-boggling
array of special effects. He's just

smart and consistently creative. A.

No categories can neatly be’
affixed to Tom Verlaine. He

‘uses elements of jazz, rock,

country, swing, even borrowing
melodic ideas from Middle East-
ern music and often overdub-
bing one style right on top of
another while still maintaining
a kind of crazy coherence. His

“voice is nearly as idiosyncratic,

careening from a deep, throaty

__croon to a paranoid whine in the -A

Verlaine will always garner
small, dense clusters of devoted

omance

fans. He's just too interesting

for mass appeal. I .
_His last lp, now two years old,

was called Words From the Front

and dealt almost exclusively“

with dissolving relationships,
interpersonal and international.
The music, correspondingly,
was an agonizing, corrosive cry
—— not one for help but one of
despair. Not a party album, to be
sure.- , V ‘
Cover is a return to the world
of the living for Verlaine. Incor-
porating all the Meccentricities
for which he is known, he's
forged a brighter, more optimis-
tic vision and even written a
couple of love songs. ‘
"Foolish Heart,” ”Miss Emily"
and ”Swim" are all concerned
with a cheery fatalism, the
hopeful hopelessness of obses-
sive ‘romantic love. "Foolish
Heart” is a soft, measured, lush
tribute. Unabashed lyrics like
"Silly thingl You hear any old

tune and you sing/ It's so quiet,I V

hear the raindrops/splashing on
the leaves] Somehow, it brings

your face to mine” can't help but .

make you smile sheepishly. '
”Miss Emily "’ promises "I'll be

ya hannndy man/Till the sun _

goes down] I'll work real hard]

‘ Her,”

, dominating, trading off, touch

Till my debt's been paid.”
"Swim," ' a dramatic, ‘mushy
sendup, sounds like an ’80's
update of "Tell Laura I Love
but with Verlaine's
jangly, sparse sound intact and a
beautiful guitar solo ‘that
shimmers and saunters all over
an overdubbed rhythm track.’
"Rotation" and ”Dissolve/Re-
veal" are more obviously adven-
turous. ”Rota_tion" has
Verlaine's signature of riffs,
sparse and spacious, with gui-
tars, bass and keyboards meld-
ing together in a game -of
musical hot potato — none‘

and go. It's unhurried, like a 5
a.m. jazzjam. But even with its
unpolished, improvised pacing,

you can tell that every note was

planned — but
deliberate.
"Dissolve/Reveal” sets up an
array of rhythms and noises of
which Byrne and Eno would be
proud.‘ Using. single, notes as a
rhythm track,_a tin drum~like
chorus and a marvelous guitar

untidy,

V solo, this one is a musical collage

with seams everywhere, so
many that it's seamless. Ver-
laine whines_in affirmation, ”I’m
unraveling to the core."

This is classic Tom Verlaine,
and it's upbeat, too. So if you
haven't already sampled this
rock ’n’ roll genius, this album is
a terrific way to start. What are
you waiting for?

result couldn't stir your blood
even if played at 78 speed.

If you were pleased with the"

previous self-titled lp from
Naked Eyes, be cautious. Their
latest contains no instant hit, no
tune that sticks out as a sure-
shot Top 40 favorite. Hoping

for something akin to the poppy ’

chart—topper ”Always Some-
thing There To Remind Me,”
the stylish cover of an old Burt
Bacharach/Hal David tune that
highlighted the first album?
Forget it. (Where are Burt and
Hal when you need them
0:». anyway?)

Fuel For The Fire begins quickly
with the danceable "(What) In
The Name Of Love” but
declines equally fast, leveling
off into the type of pop music
that cut-out bins are made of.

What we are faced with is a
completely lackluster ten-song
collection, over-programmed
(Yaz they're not), hyper-

synthesized and utterly boring.
Fuel For The Fire, the latest from
Naked Eyes —— douse this one.

THE GO-,GO’S
Civic Arena
September 16, 1984

By Bryan I. Fischer

The Go-Go's have come quite a
way since the band's debut album
Beauty and the Beat catapulted the girls
into the limelight and seven weeks at
Number One on Billboard's album
charts. Gone are the lightweight riffs
and vocal cooing that made the Go-
Go’s so cute, so fun and, all too often,
not so inspiring.

Now on tour supporting the band's,
most demanding record to date, Talk
Show, the Go-Go's have put all their
well-documented problems (guitarist
Charlotte Caffey’s hand ailment,
drummer Gina Schock’s heart
surgery, etc.) behind them in search
of the musical effervescence that
once made them so irresistible to so
many listeners.

With the bands beefed-up instru-
mental approach, each of the players
now has far more impact than is dis-
cernible on either of the first two
records (before Talk Show). Charlotte
Caffey, in particular, showed versa-
tility stepping out from behind the‘
keyboards to cut into a guitarpart,»
while Gina Schock provided the
pounding foundation from which
most of the Go-Go's beat crazy music
-takes off. ’

Although a cold or maybe just
fatigue caused Carlisle’s voice to
struggle when the music challenged
her (”Turn to You,” ”We Got the
Beat," ”Capture‘ the Light,” for
instance), the Go-Go's aren't about
precision, they're about fun.

The crowd certainly seemed to
agree.

._It took a little longer this time, but
the result was the same. The Pitt
women’s‘ tennis team won its third

I match in asimany tries yesterday by

Tféfeating Slippery Rock at Trees
Courts.

In a match that lasted well over
four hours, the Pitt team was finally
able to clinch the victory in the No. 2
doubles match. In that match, the
Pitt tandem of Jodi Levine and Car-
rie DeVera outlasted Slippery
Rock's Elaine Tonelli and Debbie
Abbato.

In a collegiate tennis match a team
must win five of the nine total
matches played, six singles matches
5/gllowed by three doubles matches.
' Assistant coach George Hoffman,
who took the helm as acting head

Ladies   throw

coach yesterday, said the key~was
that the team hung together. “I
thought the whole team played like
champs. We won four of five three-
set singles matches, and ,that’s very
important."

In tennis, a‘ three-set match is like
a one-run game in baseball; if you
don’t win those, you don't win,
period.

In one of those matches, Devera
battled back from being down’ to
match point in the second set to win
that set. However, DeVera could not
hold on in the third set, and the
match went to Slippery Rock’s

Abbato, l-6, 6-7, 4-6. “Carrie played _

a very gutsy match,” said,Hoffman.
“That match could have gone either
way; it was 4-4 at one point in the
third set.”

DeVera was not happy with her
play. ‘‘I’m disappointed, I guess, I
thought I played a bad match.”

Another player who was not at all

Rock   for loss

’ happy with her play was sophomore

Jenny Leach, who dropped her first
match of the season 1-6, 0-6. “I
played awful. I double-faulted a lot.
I should have given her a better
match but she still played very well.”

Both Levine and Rhonda Gibbs,
the No. l and 2 players respectively,
each won for the third time this sea-
son’. .Gibbs, however, had a difficult
time of it. “This is the best player I’ve
faced all season.”

Along with her opponent, Gibbs
was battling a cold. “I woke up with
it today and it bothered me a little
bit, but I was just so psyched up for
this match‘ that I was able to over-
come it."

Levine also had what she called “a
hard time” of it. “This was the-hard-
est match all year. It's really difficult
going to class from 8 to 4, then hav-
ing..to come right out here and con-
centrate on tennis.”

Levine, a. pharmacy major, will

Arians   rea ying

;B;'y Mark A. Slndler
The Pitt News I

Forgive Bruce‘ Arians if he
seemed a bit presumptuous. A little

_ over a year ago, after carefully'step-

ping onto the head coaching plat-

rm at Temple, the Owls had
‘defeated Syracuse on the strength of
a watertight defense. '

Forcing nine punts, two intercep-
tions and a fumble, Temple gave its
20th head coach an undefeated
record. Even though it was Syra-
cuse, a win is a win, a cause to
celebrate.

Arians \was feeling pretty
euphoric. Not ecstatic, but satisfied.

It was an omen. Later, he'd call it
a rookie mistake. The Owls, from
J. _ere, went on to loseifive straight-

"games, the first a 35-0 drubbing by
Pitt. '

‘“Before that game we went out in
shorts [in practice],” Arians said
Wednesday, preparing for tomor-
row’s game against Pitt [noon kick-
off, Veterans Stadium]. “We didn’t
want to hurt anyone, so we put on
shorts and pads and went through
everything except hitting. We didn’t
get better fundamentally. Now, we
can’t be worried about who’s going
to get hurt."

If a scent of disgust seems to be
apparent, Arians is the source. After
controlling East Carolina 17-0 two

Qgeeks ago in Greenville, N.C., Tem-
ple evaporated against Rutgers last
week 10-9. It was a sorrv offensive
performance, one that overshad-
woed a defense that emerged two
weeks ago as No. 1 overall in the
nation.

“We had every opportunity to win
that game,” Arians rasped. “We
were in the corner with [tailback]
Paul Palmer and four or ﬁve yards

page 16.

from the goal line. We blew it
because of malfunctions in the
blocking schemes.”

Sounds like that could be pasted
to Pitt's progress charts as well.
Anyway, that I6-play, eight minute

, drive started the second half for

Temple and the Owls never did set
the tempo. “It wasn't a matter of
Rutgers stopping us,” Arians added.
“We stopped ourselves.” .
Temple now stands at l-l and in a
position similar in two ways to that
of last year. Once again, it faces a
Pitt team startinga new quarter-
back. Well, somewhat new. After a
severe ankle sprain toppled John

Congemi last week, head coach.

Foge Fazio appointed, John Cum-

‘ mings over candidates Dante Wiley

and Chris Jelic, a quarterback from
Mt. Lebanon who hassince become
the Panthers’ punter.

Last year, Congemi got the call in

his first game ever and never looked ‘

back.

Also, the Owls -face a major power '
- that has been winless in its last three

games. Last year, it was national
champion Penn State, andthe Nit-
tany Lions just escaped 23-18 for
their first '83 win.

“Congemi had a great game,"

Arians said "of the junior’s touch-
down and 177 passing yards. “I
know him; he's a great kid. _I was
kind of hoping he wasn’t going to
start against us again.“

Maybe that wish is granted. -But it

doesn't guarantee an "Owl. victory,

though a nine-out-of-ten sampling
of city tavern patrons here might
indicate otherwise. ‘

While Arians, works on refining
his option offense, the same one that

broke down last week», he can’t be.

bothered by the Panthers’ latest
starting quarterback. , '

“I think Cummings threw the ball
well; he‘ showed that at Tennessee,"
Arians recalled of Cummings’ first

 7 iPress’Box
7 Temple Tourney I

Every year it ‘seems the Pitt
women’s volleyball team performs
quite well in the Temple Invita-
tional. With a depleted roster this
year and stronger competition, that
may change. Hitter_Pat Belcher will
be heavily counted upon. "Story;

for 2nd lesson

and last starting assignment. “But

we can’t be worried about who’s
going to start at quarterback or how

they’ll change. They usually block
/well. The thing that will help us is to
get some of those Oklahoma guys
and-put them in our uniforms."
Running the Temple option is Lee
Saltz, a sophomore who‘s allegedly
more adept at running the ball than
passing. He’s only thrown for 188
yards, completing 53 percent of his
passes. Arians has had him running
more in the two games “to bring him
in slow at first in the passing attack.”
He only has 32 net yards rushing,
though he has grossed l0l yards.
“He’s a better passer,” Arians con-
tinued". “So far, we've been exploit-
ing his quickness. After two games

- now, we’re trying to diversify the

passing attack. _[The offense] may
h have been too simple up until now..
We’ve got to maintain‘ ball control.”

In other words, Temple isn’t fum-

bling (only one so far) but succumb- ‘

ing to penalties and stalled
executions in scoring drives that eat
into the clock. Already, Temple has
controlled the ball seven more min-
utes than ECU and Rutgers each.

While the offense works on con-
verting work into points more effi-
ciently, Arians will-continue. to lay
trust in another sophomore, Palmer,
a back with 4.4‘-second speed in the
40 yard dash. He leads the team with
173 yards on 43 carries.

Interestingly, Temple's two oppo- .

nents haven’t seen much of. Palmer
during first down this year. “Those

' have been our passing downs so far,”

Arian said..“I_t keeps teams off-bal-
ance. We want to stay out of third-
and-long situations. We don't want
to give Pitt any chance totee off on
us." .

Stephanie Nelson toiled in the
longest match of the day, which
lasted over two and a half hours,
defeating Casey Doyle in three sets,
6-2, 5-7, 7-5. 4 - »

“I played a terrible second set,”

Nelson said after the marathon
match, “I got my confidence back in

the third set and won. I played to her

lbackhand and moved her around a
ot.”

In the No. 6 singles match, Col-
leen Driscoll won 1-6, 6-4, 6-1. After
her usual loss in the first set, Driscoll
came on strong to score the win. “I
was nervous again. I haveto learn to
be more patient with the ball and
wait for her to make mistakes.”
Hoffman said of Driscoll, “She
seems to need to get one set in before
she gets settled down and plays
well.” I

Driscoll was given a break in the
first set of her match when Slippery
Rock's Lisa Howe injured her hand.
Injury or not, the outcome of the

match probably would not have

changed, but the hand did bother

Howe to some extent. “It affected ,

my play some, but you get used to it
after a while and just play with it."

Another Slippery Rock player,
Cathy Holtzman, may have come up
with something before-her victory
over‘ Leach: get sick. “I was sick to
my stomach before the match. I was
just so nervous, it went away after a
while, but it really bothered me at
first."

Players on both teams were
bothered by the lack of adequate
lighting at Trees Courts. The match
went on well‘ beyond daylight, and in
the doubles matches many players
were bothered by the‘dim lighting.
“How are you supposed to see any-’
thing out here," wondered Levine.

Lady Panthers in 1st tournament

By Laurie Kubll

—ThePlttNews

The “first big challenge” has
arrived for the Pitt women's volley-
ball team as it heads to Philadelphia
for the Temple Invitational this
weekend.

According to head coach Shelton
Collier, it is a tournament that his
team has traditionally won, but he
does not foresee an easy victory this
time around.

“We'll be favored to do real well,”
Collier stated. “Obviously, it's our
first big challenge and it will be a
difficult tournament. We play
Princeton, who will be very tough,
and Providence, who won the Big

East championship last season and

have the whole team back, team
intact." -

He said that it will be a tough
tournament because the eventual
winner must win six games — two
on Friday and four Saturday. “With
a small roster, we’re really going to
have to play well and make a really
big effort to be in a position to win

the tournament."

Collier said that Pat Belcher will
be very important to his team today
and tomorrow. “Pat is potentially
one of our most potent hitters and
our strongest blocker. A lot of our
success will be determined by how
well Pat plays the net."

Belcher said that the match with
Providence, which upset Pitt in the
finals lastzseason, will be an impor-
tant meeting. “We're hungry for
Providence because we feel like we
owe them something. I know I'll

play my heart out."

The 5-10 hitter missed playing
time in the previous two seasons due
to injuries, mainly knee problems,
and now has a bigger role on the
team. “It means I have to work
harder, and there's not much room
for error because we don't have as
many people to compensate with.”

Collier is also relying on setter
Cathy Rupp to guide the squad to
victory. “If she plays really strong,
we’ll be in a position to have a good
weekend," the coach said. “We
count on her as a leader as well as her
spiking and setting."

Rupp, a senior, said that the
match with Providence will mean
something if Pitt plays well. “If we
play well and we win, then we can
keep getting better. If _we nlav W811
and lose, then we’ll see what needs
done, what we have to do to beat

them next time. If we play poorly -
it’s not going to be Providence that
did this to us."

Kris Wexell missed several days of
practice last week due to an injury to

‘her hip and played part-time in the

match at Duquesne earlier in the
week, but Collier said she will be
back in the lineup today.

“Kris will be reinserted in her
familiar position as our primary
server receiver in all six rotations,”
Collier explained. “Even if slightlv
hampered by her injury, she is still
our best serve receiver.”

Collier said that Sue Hoover and
Ulana Kohutiak are his key spikers
as middle blockers. “If they play
well, they can be the best MB's at the
tournament. If they don’t, we’re not
going to be in a position to win the
tournament."

Kohutiak said, “It will be a differ-

who the team lost to mononucleosis
last week. “Judy will be missed, but
we’re a strong team and the show
must go on.” Young’s role as floor
quarterback has been taken over by
Rupp, who alternated as setter with
Young.

Junior Sally Gillespie has been in
the lineup to serve and often sets
alongside Rupp, but she is not a
strong net player. “Sally is very
important to us because she is taking
Judy Young’s spot. She played a

major role as a freshman in our Big *“~

East championship win. I'm sure
she’ll be real hungry to play a role in
us winning this year," said Collier.

Lisa Stewart said she transferred
from Tennessee because the south-
ern school “did not meet my needs."

Ring Notes

NEW YORK (UPI) — A doctor
treating former heavyweight cham-
pion Muhammad Ali said that Ali is
not “punch drunk” or suffering fror=,:.,.
Parkinson’s disease.

Dr. Martin Ecker is helping to
diagnose Ali’s slurred speech and
hand tremors with tests at Columbia
Presbyterian Medical Center in New
York City. Ecker'says Parkinson’s
disease has been ruled out as well as
any lingering effects from blows to
the head during Ali’s legendary

. career.

Dr. Ecker revealed that Ali may
be suffering from Parkinsonism,
which mimics Parkinson's disease, 23'
degenerative brain disorder.

The former champion is expected
to be discharged from the hospital
next Monday.

MONTE CARLO (UPI) ~— WBA
welterweight champion Donald
Curry will defend his title for the
fourth time this Saturday in Monte
Carlo against Nina la Rocca of Italy.

Curry, the 23-year-old champion,
says of La Rocca, “La Rocca’s got a
big mouth and runs "around the
ring.” Curry figures that La Rocca is
the only welterweight who can
match his hand and foot speed bus
not his power.

The Pitt News, Friday, September 2'1. .1934-

‘B

Everyone‘s heads were turned
last week, right? Turned away
from this space, right? No, it isn’t
that we don't want you to use this
as a public service self-help guide
to better betting, it’s just that The
Pitt News Gridiron Gurus did
not break out the champagne
after its inaugural week.

Some may hang their heads in
shame, but this is not a shoddy
operation. We'll merely bear
down and attempt to put a dis-
astrous 14-22 start behind us.
That was the combined record of
the four in-house gurus last
weekend.

Before getting on with tomor-
row’s big games, a few words (or
maybe more than are necessary)
are in order concerning last
weekend’s debacle. A couple of
gurus in two instances broke
with the reigning trend and bet
with a couple of underdogs. The
Grocery Bagger, Mark A.
' Sindler, went with a recent night-

mare he had and picked Okla-
homa over Oakland's favorite,.
the Panthers. Of course, whether
they’re still anyone’s favorite,
well, let's just say that folks aren’t
yet ﬂocking to the dreaded Penn
State camp. The other trend-
breaker turned out to be Stan I
Savron, the WTAE sportscaster.
who picked Stanford over Illi-
nois. Congrats go to Stan for the
intuition there. But no more con-
fetti. Stan ﬁnished 3-6 last week.

'5} With luck the four staff gurus,

not to mention a special Guest
Guru, will get the house in order
this week and focus the micro-
scope on the relevant facts. Then
again, some may stop reading
right here knowing that Beano
Cook has been contracted as this
week’s guest correspondent.
That's right; the guy people

Arians’—

lesson

continued from _page ﬁfteen

have fans seen the unit on the ﬁeld
while the offense has squandered
supposed scoring drives? In any
case, Arians is rightfully wary of this

“Pitt tradition, more specifically of

the East's top linebacker duo —
Troy Benson and Caesar Aldisert,
who are 1-2 in tackles so far. Free
safety Bill Callahan has adjusted
well in Tom F lynn’s old niche and is
third in tackles.

“The Pitt defensive backﬁeld is
talented, and the only way that
happens is through experience,”
Arians said in describing what’s
been a baptism by fire so far. “They
played one great passing game

[BYU] and did exceptionally well.”

Which means nothing will likely
change tomorrow for the sopho-

Igagnore coach who must direct Temple



 

through what the NCAA has termed
the tenth toughest schedule in the
country.

“We had a mental breakdown the
week before,” Arians explained. “I
attribute that to second game blues.
Teams go through that. We could
have won the game; we didn't, and
that's what‘s frustrating.”

-GRID BITS: .Tomorrow’s contest
is Temple’s first at home and a break
for the Owls, who will play five of

’?«‘’their first six games on the road.

Temple must still play Florida State,

Boston College and West Virginia, .

among others.

Freshman center Ed Miller will
probably start in place of Barry Pet-
tyjohn, who hyperextended his
elbow in practice Wednesday. Split
end Bill Wallace is tied for ﬁfth in
the nation in receptions per game.
His average of eight per game ties
him with Stanford's Thomas Hen-
ley. Freshman Dante Wiley is 28th
in the nation in punt returns with an

Gridiron gurus

Beano, better known as look-
ing like an unmade bed when he’s
not on the air for ABC—TV, not
only rattled off football forecast-
ing but obligingly diagnosed (he
is not an M.D.)the current state
of what's officially known as the
Pitt Panthers football team.

We‘ve heard folks call it other
things recently. “First of all,
there’s no running backs," Beano
began. “They’re worrying too
much about strength on that line
and not quickness. They played
the clock poorly against Brigham
Young. And with a 14-3 lead,

there was some questionable-
. play calling.”

Beano has served as sports
information director at Pitt, so
it’s conceivable he knows at least
something about football in
these parts.

“Pitt was quick for a while,"
Beano continued. “Now they’re
not. I’m going back to the
[Johnny] Majors and [Jackie]
Sherrill years. Pitt isn’t playing
smart football. Now they’re
going back to strength.” '

Wait .a minute, Beano Cook is
not finished. When you’re a TV

analyst, it's not enough to just,

dwell on the past and present.
“If they don’t have a good year

Gridiron

next year, they'll have to take a
long look at the program,”
Beano admitted. “I mean, I
didn’t expect too much from
them this year. But next year
they should be quite good. After
playing Ohio State away the
schedule favors them. Next year
they should be quite good."

If it is inferred that Beano is
already writing this season off,
not to worry. Miracles — pre-
season polls withstanding —-—
were not expected in ’84.

Okay. Maybe we should also
comment about the eight or so
shows Beano does for a cable TV
outfit in Cincinnati, Sportstime.
It’s one of many operations
beaming college football games
across the Midwest.

At last, tomorrow’s games.
Embarrassed, we must admit

Pitt v. Temple L

Southern Cal v. Arizona St.

Wisconsin v. Michigan

gurus

that the gurus had.the Southern
Cal game at Arizona State being
played last Saturday. Check
that. The game is this week. In
nearby Columbus, the Buckeyes
face Iowa after Ohio State
brought off big-time wins
against Qregon State and
Washington State, two perennial
PAC-10 doormats.

Game of the week spotlight
should be shining on otherwise
smog-ﬁlled Los Angeles where
UCLA will entertain the beefy
farm boys from Lincoln, Neb.
The Bruins‘ assuredly will put the
Cornhuskers’ No. 1 ranking to
the test.

Now, one has to wonder why a -
Division I-AA team would want
to play Penn State, let alone in
Beaver Stadium. Didn’t Brown
University learn its lesson last

year? Anyway, William & Mary
will step into Happy Valley
tomorrow. Who knows how
they’ll leave? ‘
Miami is home for the first
time this season after compiling a
3-1 record in four straight road
games. It's going to be tough
gauging West Virginia's contest
with Maryland at Mountaineer
Field. The Terps have lost two
straight to Syracuse (can you
believe it?) and Vanderbilt.
Meantime, the Mounties have

handled Ohio and Louisville .

quite well while barely escaping

with a seven-point win over Vir-

ginia Tech last week.

By the way, that line score
Beano pegged on the Penn State
game is no typographical error.
He was feeling a bit exuberant.

er 2.1

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

Olympic silver-medalist Deb-
bie Green preaches a philosophy
worth repeating and utilizing.
“Take it a step at a time,” said
Green.

“When I was 14, I wasn’t
thinking ‘Olympics,’ ” Green
explained. “I'd think, well,
maybe I can set for this team, and
then maybe I can play for this
other team.” I

The Olympian made the com-
ments at a_ setting clinic she held
Wednesday in Trees Hall from
32530 to 9:30 p.m. Approximately

, 200 area players I and coaches
paid $35 each to attend the clinic,
which was the thirtieth stop
Green has made out of a 70-city.
tour. Yesterday, she was in Buf-
falo, New York. Green’s father,
Don, is traveling with her.

Many steps can be taken in
ll years, which is how long
Green-said she trained for the
Olympics under Arie Selinger.
The stony—faced Selinger trained
his team six days a week, year,-
round, for six years.

“Train for success,” Green told
the coaches in attendance. ‘
“Don’t teach failure, don’t teach
fear,” she said in response to a
question from the audience on
how to run a defensive drill.

“I’d stand one foot away and
throw the ball [at the player],"
she said jokingly. “No. l’d set up
mats and cushions to practice
rolling off them. Just toss the
balls, don’t throw them. Have it
so'that 70 to 80 percent of the
balls are dug or at least touched."
V Pitt women’s volleyball coach
Shelton Collier, who organized

, 12984  

Mark Lewis/ The Pitt News

Debbie Green

’ the Pitt end ofthe arrangements,
was satisfied ‘with the attend-
ance. “This shows some of the

I positive effects of Olympic vol-

leyball,” Collier remarked. “It
definitely helped the credibility

of women’s volleyball. The level
of play was so impressive it
opened a lot of people’s eyes.

“To have Debbie Green here
was great for volleyball in west-
ern Pennsylvania,” Collier
affirmed. He pointed out that the
clinic attracted a lot of potential
recruits, especially from this
area. “Our No. l recruit from’
Norwin was here, and a lot of
other high school prospects were
here.

“The tour organizers wanted
to stop here because they know
it’s a good volleyball city,” Col-
lier continued. “Our players got
to meet a top-level player, and
it’s highly motivational.”

Green gave many tips on var-
ious sets, including the jump,
short and back sets, as well as’
general comments on offenses
andldefenses. “You only attack
the ball here," she said, holding
both hands~over her forehead in
the setter’s stance. “If it’s too far
away, the referee will call a
carry." She also compared the
6-2 offense, which Collier uses,
with the ‘single-setter 5-l
formation.

“In the 5- l , the setter improves
quicker, and it’s easier for spikers
to adjust to one setter, who is the
quarterback on the floor.”

The accomplished setter
recalled having a coach who
seemed to aim for players’ faces
during defensive drills. “Forget
digging the ball — I had to get
away,” Green said with a laugh.
Resuming a sincere attitude, she
said, “Whatever your goal is,
whether it’s making the high.
school or collegelteam, or even
the Olympic team, remember
that most people are quitters. I
can remember when I was a
hopeless case, and someone said,
‘Stick it out. Everyone else will"
quit, and he'll have to play you.’ ”
