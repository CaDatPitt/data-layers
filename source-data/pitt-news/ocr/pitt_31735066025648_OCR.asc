1993 SGB candidates
unveil their platforms

The following are essays that can-
didates for this year’s Student
Government Board elections were
required to submit. The essays high-
light their campaign platforms and
goals if elected.

Presidential Candidate Jacob
Brodyz.

“Our University is poised on the
verge of making a great leap for-
ward. We need experienced leaders
to make sure that we, the students,
are not left behind. As a Board
member [President pro tempore, I
have the proven leadership experi-
ence to put the students first.
Proven leadership does not come
from a title or a position, but from
efforts and

hard work. 1 Student Government Board

have been a member of the
Allocations Committee, a board
member and the Business Manager
of the board. I rose from alternate
member of the Allocations
Committee to full member by doing
my job diligently and effectively. As
a board member, I created the out-
door cafe next to the union and
worked hard to meet the call of stu-
dents for greater safety, more
Choice Dollars and a general

increase in quality of life at our uni- ‘

versity. Lastly, as Business Manager
I successfully cut $50,000 from the
board’s budget without cutting any
of the services provided by the
board.

“It is this

your behalf to
improve our
transportation
system, devel-
op an escort
s e r v i c e ,

student" participation and represen-
tation throughout this institution.
But we can do more.

“Our culturally diverse communi-
ty has issues that must be addressed
by your student government presi-

dent: In order to work successfully’

with the administration and commu-
nity your president, must have the
knowledge of this institution’s gov-
ernance system. I have worked
with administrators on the universi-
ty budget, the Chancellor’s Task
Force for Safety and Security, the
Cultural Diversity Committee and
the Senate Council. I have gained

_the knowledge and the respect to
' continue working for you, the stu-

dents.
“I have proven leadership experi-

fence, the desire and dedication and

the respect for you so that together
we can move this university for-
ward.”

Presidential Candidate
Christopher G. Skutches:

“I believe that you, my fellow stu-
dents, are asking yourselves what
makes me qualified to be your pres-
ident. Put more simply; What have I
done for you lately? Well, in my
two years of involvement in SGB, I

leadership

needed to
guide the
b o a r (1
through the
next year.
As president, I will provide this
leadership and will continue to fight
for what you, the students, want
and need on this campus. After all,
you are my boss, and it is my duty
to perform my job as you would
want me to.” L _

The board candidates’ essays
appear in alphabetical order.

Brian K. Bolton:

“I’m running to represent the peo-
ple who the university has seemed
to have forgotten, the black stu-
dents. There is a tendency by Pitt to
forget the black student when it
comes to diversity. I would like to
bring to the front issues of low
retention and graduation rates of
black students. I also feel there isn’t
enough social activities for the
students in general here at Pitt.
This leads students to seek ulterior
entertainment (i.e. drinking par-
ties).

Another major issue that everyone
seems to forget is that there aren’t
enough quality academic advisors at
this institute of higher education. If
we can get proper advising from
our advisors this may bring a rever-
sal to the low retention and gradua-
tion rates.”

Students

meet the

candidates

By Christine Hanna
and Beth Kovaly
The Pitt News

Student Government
Board candidates
strayed from the usual
issues of Choice Dollars,
campus safety and rela-
tions with the adminis-
tration as they fielded
questions on student
concerns.

The candidates intro-
duced themselves to the
student body at Meet
the Candidates last night
in the William Pitt
Union.

Presidential candidates
Jacob Brody and
Christopher Skutches
were asked to say one
word that would
describe each of their
prospective terms.

“Active,” Skutches
said.
“Hey, he took my

word,” Brody protested
with a smile, and then
after a brief pause he
said, “Pro-active.”
Board candidate
Thomas Grassia said
that if elected he would
propose to cut half the
money that SGB
receives from the
Student Activities fee
and give it to the stu-
dents, who could then
choose which organiza-
tions would receive
their part of that fee.
“That is the most
important thing,”
Grassia said. “You are
involved and you know
where part of that
money goes.”
Candidates Anthony
Moody and August
Imholtz disagreed with
Grassia on cutting the
funds.
“[Grassia’s plan] is
uninformed and inap-

propriate,” Moody said.‘

“The idea would hurt
organizations on cam-
pus, including the gov-
ernance groups, which
are the backbone of the
campus.”

Imholtz ‘said that the
minority organizations
such as Bisexual Gay
and Lesbian Alliance,
Black Action Society
and Campus Women’s
Organization would find
their budgets drastically

“The majority of the student
population is not interested in
these groups, whether it’s
from homophobia, racism —
they just don’t care,” Imholtz
said. “This would be damag-
ing not only to those groups
but to those students who
benefit from those groups.”
A student asked David Ott,
—a member of Pitt’s Army
ROTC, how he felt about the

7Army’s discrimination against

gays and lesbians.

Ott said that if elected he

would support the ROTC
because it is not an indepen-
dent group and is not free to
make its own policy.

“Its policies are not made
on campus. Its policies are
made in Washington, D.C., by
the Department of Defense
and our national government,”
Ott said. >

He also said that three—
fourths of the students in the
program would not be able to
attend Pitt without the ROTC

scholarships. -

The student who asked the
question responded, “If you
have to attend it under a poli-
cy of discrimination, it is not
worth attending this universi-
ty.”
An issue addressed to the
presidential candidates was
how they would deal with the
problems that women face on
campus.

Brody said there is igno-

rance and a lack of under-
standing of women’s issues on
campus. Rape and sexual
assault are not just women’s
issues but campus issues, he
said.

“The Student Government
Board, what they need to do,
is educate all students, espe-
cially women students, about
sexual harassment, about the
safety issues, date rape and
sexual assault,” Brody said.

“We need to educate each
other so we can overcome
these barriers.”

Skutches said that men need
to realize they do not run the
show.

“I would increase women
participation in everything,”
he said.

Women’s participation will
show men that women are
equal, and when men realize
that women are equal, sexual

their qualiﬁcations for this job.
I feel the past is not as impor-

the record, I am a member of

ence in student government. If
I am elected I would like to

puses. With your help we can
both make our campus a safer
place.”

David A. Colaianni:

“Having had close dealings
with the director of housing,
Robert Hopkins and the pro-
gram manager for Pitt
Ridesharing, Kathleen Miller, I
have familiarized myself with
two very large problems on
our campus. One problem is
the living conditions of the res-
idence halls on campus, I need
only cite the Forbes incident to
illustrate my point. Second, the
transportation system on cam-
pus needs improvement. As
working as a student dispatch-
er for Van—call, I know first-
hand the difficulties of moving
students around campus at
night. In both of these areas I

have found much that needs
improvement.

“As a member of a large fam-
ily, I have become quite accus-
tomed to viewing problems
from many sides and feel I am
patient enough to work with
Pitt’s administration. I feel that
if I am elected, I can offer an
open ear to students’ needs
and a genuine desire and effort
to make a difference.”

Joseph M. Foner:

“Everyone on this campus
knows there is student apathy.
I believe there are several rea-
sons for this; a lack of interest,
a lack of knowledge and a lack
of understanding. My program
deals with eliminating or
reducing the presence of these
causes of apathy.

“Foremost is student support.
This can be guaranteed by

grams, through the use of sur-
veys asking students what they
think is needed. The informa-
tion deficit can be reduced
through social meetings with
the SGB. These will allow stu-
dents to feel comfortable with
the SGB, while allowing them
to find out about and under-
stand student government pro-
grams.

“These ideas are designed to
produce more interest in and
knowledge of student govern-
ment. More students are need-
ed to carry out ideas, otherwise
they remain ideas. I believe
that my service on three SGB
committees has given me the
knowledge and experience
necessary to implement them.”

Thomas J. Grassia:

“It’s hard to care.

“It means doing things
because you have to, not
because you want to. It means
you have to stand up to stand
apart. To care is to cry out
what you believe to be right
and to fight for it. It’s hard to
care.

“But when people care, great

things can happen. When peo-
ple care they work together,
they set aside differences.
People who care are much;
worth more than the largest
allocation of funds or the
bluest blue ribbon panel.
Things can change when peo-
ple care enough to try to
change them. Sometimes it
takes one person to stand up,
to care. But it’s hard to care.

“Our safety is neglected. I
care.

“Our money is misspent. I
care.

“We emphasize our differ-
ences, not our similarities. I
care.

“Do you care?

“Vote Tom Grassia.

“Dare to care.”

August Imholtz:

“The hallmark of a great
learning institution is its ability
to keep up with the times. The

changes must be beneficial to
the student body, and as your
representative I pledge to fulfill
the duties and responsibilities
required of my position. An
essential tenet of this plan is
clear communication between
the students and the university
administration. By acting as a
liaison I can facilitate such
communication. I have been
involved in a variety of organi-
zations, including: Phi Gamma

Society, Pi Sigma Alpha Honor

gram. My involvement in the
aforementioned organizations

Senatorial gridlock

Everyday we have an unsigned editorial which is the rnajor-
ity opinion of the editorial board. We were planning to
endorse a senatorial candidate. However, this time it was
impossible for us to reach an agreement and support some-
body. Therefore, what we have below is what we feel is a
brief summary of the candidates’ best traits.

Arlen Specter

Senator Arlen Specter, an asset to the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania ever since he was elected ‘in 1980, has fought
for the rights of workers, students, children and women alike.
Yes, contrary to what many believe, Specter has fought long
and hard for women. The incumbent Senator is anything but
the Reagan Republican that he is painted by Yeakel as being.
He is adamantly prochoice and is leading the ﬁght to elirni-
nate the gag rule. And as the ranking member on the Health
Appropriations Committee, he won increased funding of
more than 40 percent for breast, ovarian and cervical cancer
research. - if

Moreover, during difficult economic times, Specter has been
a force in Congress. He pressed for the1991 Highway Bill,
which provided 540,000 jobs and improved Pennsylvania’s
infrastructure. Secondly, Specter introduced a highly-innova-
tive bill which encourages institutions of higher education to
become more actively involved in the retraining of workers.
He also has been a force on family issues, where he co-
authored the Missing Children Assistance Act of 1984. ,

But most importantly, if Pennsylvania loses Arlen Specter
we’ lose much seniority in the Senate. As a matter of fact,
Pennsylvania will rank dead last. This is important since
seniority has much to do with where funds get appropriated.

Lynn Yeakel

The emergence of Lynn Yeakel on the political scene
immediately followed the I-lill/Thomas Senate hearings and
the disgust that many Americans had with what they felt was
a travesty of justice. Her message is important — the concerns
of women will no longer be placed on the backbumer.

But Yeakel is hardly a one—issue candidate, and while the

hearings may have acted as a catalyst for her entrance into _

the race, she is one to be reckoned with. Of importance to
most college students is her stand on educational issues.
Unlike her opponent, who treats education as an extension of
our ability to compete economically, Yeakel sees education as
important in itself. Education, according to Yeakel, should be
treated as infrastructure, with everyone entitled to an equal
share. Her plan is very similar to the one proposed by
Governor Clinton. -

Also like Clinton, she believes in a responsible ﬁscal pro-
gram which includes worker retraining, public works projects
and expanded mass transit. Yeakel is inexperienced; we con-
cede that point. Maybe Pennsylvania will lose a little seniority.
But the time has come for a change, and Yeakel is more than

qualiﬁed.

An issue ignored by the candidates

This election year is quite
unique. There is a respectable
third candidate, an incumbent
in trouble and record interest
from the electorate. However,
the election isiunique because
of what it has not talked about
rather than what it has. For the
first time since the 1930s, for-
eign policy is not a major issue
in the presidential race.

At a dinner in March spon-
sored by his presidential library,
Richard Nixon gave a message
to the presidential candidates
that they should not ignore for-

‘eign affairs. His message was

more for President Bush than
anyone else.

' In this campaign, the presi-

dent faces an opponent in
Governor Clinton who uses
every possible opportunity to
talk about the economy and
stresses the main points of his
economic ‘plan. The economy is
in ‘a recession, and many of the
voters feel its effect personally
-4 in their own pocketbooks.
They want the candidates to
address their concerns.

So, Gov. Clinton goes out on
the campaign trail emphasizing
that the economy is in its worse
shape in 50 years. He is saying
everything the voters want to
hear. Never mind that many
economists say this is not the
worst economy since the
Depression.

This situation forces the presi-
dent to respond to Clinton’s
attacks on his economic record
and outline his growth plan.
Time spent talking about any-
thing other than the economic
problems in the United States is
seen by many as time wasted.
The American people do not
want to hear about foreign poli-

cy. On this point, Nixon
observed, “the mark of great
political leadership is  to
make what is unpopular popu-
lar if that serves American
national interest.” To this point,
less than a week before the
election, none of the candidates
have shown that great leader-
ship.

In past election years the

debates have focused on a nar-

row range of issues, whether it
be domestic policy, foreign pol-

KicEhdline
icy or something else. This
year, the topics were not lirnit—
ed. This led to a cursory discus-
sion of foreign affairs. In the
first debate, Clinton responded
to a question" about China and
its Most—Favored—Nation trading
status. Perot rebutted on the
issue by reciting his encyclope-
dia and saying China is a large
country with many provinces.
Clinton accents the reduction of
troops in Europe and proposes
to ask Germany and japan to
pay their fair share for world
security. Perot repeats how
important aid to the former
Soviet Union is, costing us mere
“pennies on the dollar” in com-
parison to the costs of letting
the Russians fend for them-
selves. Even on these questions,
the issue is money.

In Richmond, where the audi-
ence asked the questions, it
took more than 65 minutes for
a question on foreign policy.
Even then, it was a vague han-
dling of how the candidates
saw the new.world order.
President Bush referred to the

‘Soviet

ending of the Cold War’ through
the strength of the United States
and our continued dispropor-
tionate responsibility in world
security. Perot and Clinton
talked about money.

Foreign policy is an issue.
Character, maturity and experi-
ence do matter. In the first four
months of his administration,
President Kennedy adopted the
CIA’s ill—conceived plan to;
invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs.
It was destined for failure, but
Kennedy still proceeded. At a
summit meeting in Vienna with
Premier Nikita
Khruschev, Kennedy was bul-
lied and left shaken because
Khruschev thought he was
weak and immature.

The last time the governor of
a southern state was president,
the United States became
embroiled in the Iran hostage
crisis. Getting those hostages
free became the sole focus of
Carter’s presidency. He
launched a rescue attempt that
failed miserably in the sands of
Iran —- killing the rescue team.

Unfortunately, our world is
ripe with possibilities of con-
flict. With nuclear proliferation
continuing and numerous dicta-
tors running countries, we
could have a crisis at any
moment. In our singleminded-
ness this election year, we have
forgotten to determine exactly
what each man would do in a
dangerous situation. Our hope
is that danger will not come our
way. History tells us otherwise.

said will play important roles are
juniors Laura Nerone, Jen Burns
and Candie Burke.

Burns swam on Pitt’s top four
relay teams last year while gain-
ing a fifth—p1ace ﬁnish in the 100
backstroke at the Big East.
Nerone and Burke will con-
tribute greatly in their individual
events —— the backstrokes and
medleys respectively.

Sophomore Laura Zdyb over-
came an illness to place third in
the 400 individual medley at the
Big East championships.

Vicki Geubtner, another sec-

' ond—year swimmer, swam a life-

time best during a ninth—place
finish at the same meet.

But the key to another strong
season could very well hinge on
the performances of the this
year’s promising crop of first-
year swimmers, and in Pitt’s
case, divers.

Diving Coach Julian Krug has
sophomores Kara Sixbury and
Anne Marie Rose backfrom last
year’s squad, which had a strong
showing at the Big East even
though, as Krug put it, they
were “outclassed by Miami.”

This year promises to be dif-
ferent thanks to three highly-
touted recruits that Krug has
found. Diane Maiese, Sunday
Lewandowski and Amy
Spinnenweber are the three first-

year divers that Krug said will
make an immediate impact.
Lewandowski was
Pennsylvania state diving cham-
pion both her junior and senior
years at the Catholic Nationals.
Maiese was second at those
same Catholic Nationals her
sophomore year. ’
Spinnenweber was the third-
place finisher the last two years
at the WPIAL meet and placed
fourth at states both those years.
“Now that Miami is no longer
a mystery, and in addition to our
strong blend of upperclassmen
and newcomers, I feel that we
will seriously test Miami and
hopefully regain the title,” Krug

said.

Belowich said he is just as
enthused about his group of
ﬁrst—year swimmers.

“The freshmen are a very tal-
ented bunch of girls who will
blend in very nicely and till the
gaps.”

Jill Fletcher and Chantel
Glover will fill some needs in
the breaststrokes, while Jenny
Doran is a strong butterﬂy spe-
cialist.

In the freestyle events, Chrissy
Di Leonardo and Alicia T ymes
are extremely talented sprinters.
Susan Poorbaugh has plenty of
potential in the distance events.

that has changed is this group’s
experience. It is a war—torn
group that has only lost three
games in the past two seasons,
not a notorious squad but a
very effective one.

“They will pose a very large
challenge to us,” Pitt quarter-
back Alex Van Pelt said. “Their
linebackers are very solid.”

“The senior linebacking is the
key to their defense,” Hackett
said. '

All four of Syracuse’s starting
linebackers are seniors. Led by
inside backer Glen Young, who
leads the team in tackles with
44, the Orange defense has
only allowed 28 total points in
the last two games.

At outside linebacker,
Syracuse remains strong. Jo Jo
Wooden uses his 6-foot-4-inch

frame to keep ball carriers

under wraps. He leads the
Orangemen in sacks (four-and-
a—half) and is also fourth on the
team in tackles (31). Rounding
out the linebacking corps are
Matt Greco and Garland
Hawkins, inside and out. Both
complement Young and
Wooden well.

Complementing the lineback-
ers better would be inside line-
backer Dan Conley, who has
been out with nagging injuries.
If Conley plays, Pitt’s up-the—gut
running game could be gone.

“I’m hopeful Danny [Conley]
will be back this week,”

Defense

Continued from page 11
Syracuse head coach Paul
Pasqualoni said of his sidelined
rLm stopper. ‘

Not to be overshadowed by
the seniority of the linebackers,
the defensive line of the Orange
is outstanding, mainly. because
of ‘a converted linebacker now
. playing nose tackle.

The ex-linebacker is Kevin
Mitchell. This 251—pound junior
uses his quick feet to dominate
I I the line of scrimmage.

“An outstanding player
g... without question,” Pasqualoni
 said about Mitchell. “He’s play-
?‘ ing really steady football week-
in and week-out, nothing

ﬂashy.”

But Mitchell does not have to
be ﬂashy. His eight tackles for
26 yards in losses speak for
themselves. His performance is
another key to Syracuse’s defen-
sive success.

“Kevin Mitchell is a linebacker
playing on the [defensive] A line,”
Hackett said. “He has tremen-
dous quickness and speed.”

With senior-dominated line-
backers and an excellent nose
tackle in Mitchell, Syracuse
looks unbeatable. But as Ohio
State exploited earlier this sea-
son, the Orange secondary is
vulnerable.

“If there is any weakness on

their defense, it is the sec-
ondary,” Hackett said. “Their
secondary is the youth of the
team.”

Thatmakes this Saturday’s
match—up against Alex Van Pelt
a very big concern for
Pasqualoni and his defensive
backﬁeld. -

“We got inexperienced people
back there [in the secondaryl,”
Pasqualonilsaid. “We’ve put
some new people in, and we
are slowly becoming more
familiar with the defensive
schemes. We keep getting better
each week, but Saturday is
going to be a great challenge for
us.” _

Challenging Van Pelt is what

“We’ve never stopped Alex, he
has a history of playing well
against us.”

Free safety Tony Jones could
be a key in changing history this
Halloween. The sophomore is
another new addition to the
youthful secondary. Jones has 29
tackles this season and two
interceptions. He has become a
fixture in the shaky Syracuse
defensive backﬁeld.

“Tony Jones is impressive,”
Hackett said. ,“I’ve been
impressed with their youthful
secondary.”

If the Syracuse secondary can
sustain a Van Pelt air assault, its
linebackers and defensive line
should provide a tough test for

Changes

Continued from page 8
Seagraves.

“Chavis is a good inside
linebacker, and Sumner is very
good. He gets better every
snap,” Rapone said. “Last year
at this time they were playing
high school football. Chavis is
big and strong. He can run to
the football, and he is getting
better. They [Chavis and
Sumner] have no experience
so they are doing everything

on innate talent.”

Matt Hosilyk is the third true
first-year player starting on
defense.

Hosilyk is a defensive end
from Coraopolis, Pa.

“Last game, Hosilyk had two
sacks, Sumner had an inter-
ception and Chavis made
seven tackles,” Rapone said.
“That is not bad for three
freshmen playing in their first
year.”

Rapone said he feels good
about his young defense, but
it needs time.

“When you’re young, you
got to play the guys, and
they’re going to make mis-
takes,” Rapone said. “But you
got to stick with them,
because in the last two weeks
we have improved on defense.

“[East Carolina] was the
number-one passing team in
the country,” Rapone said.

. “They throw for an average of

384 yards and they only got
212 yards on us. Four weeks
ago against Maryland we gave
up a ton of yardage, so each
week we’re improving.”

With Whaley moving to out-
side linebacker, Sumner start-
ing at strong safety and Chavis
starting at right inside line-
backer, the Panthers have
more team speed.

“It makes our defense

faster,” Chavis said. “Some
people say if it makes the
defense faster then you’re los-
ing size with Whaley (at 5-
feet-11-inches, 185 pounds).
But with Doug [Wha1ey],
you’re not losing heart.
Whaley will get in there and
hit a 300-pound lineman like
he’s hitting a back. Whaley
has that type of mentality that
whatever it takes to do — he
will do-it.”

There are some Independent rock bands whose
sounds naturally cater to a wide audience, but remain
widely unheard because of their Indie roots. Scrawl,
who performs this Friday with Seam and a trio of local
talent at Carnegie Mellon, is one. Texturally lovely and
intricate, Scrawl blends delicate harmonies over jangly
guitar riffs ‘for a poppy sound that is often replicated

economic reasons.

Fiscally, it remains an Indie band because its record-
ing efforts are on Indie labels, thus people turn an
untuned ear to the band (and Indie rock in general),
easily shrugging it off as too outside the mainstream,
simply because its records aren’t released to media
hype and in massive quantities. ,

Scrawl, three females from Ohio who released their
debut LP in the late ‘80s, have been around to witness
the recent gush of Femme rock in the Indie under-

East Coast, speciﬁcally out of Boston, groups like Salem
66 passionately announced a female presence in rock.
Now “girl rock” covers all of Indie rock’s broad bases,
from noisy metal (L7) to the prettier sounds of love
rock (Bratmobile, Tsunami).

Somewhere in between all that lies Scrawl, that
comes with unpretentious Midwest honesty in its lyrics,
while avoiding the trivial and mundane. The band’s
words speak about disenfranchisement, without getting

New Pesci vehicle The Public
Eye way short of focal length

Trunk of funk: Joe Pesci stars as Leon Bernstein, who was inspired to turn
’   into a mobile darkroomin The Public Eye. 

By Jason Hillman

, Editor in Chief

Ah, the life of a photographer.

The Public Eye, the new Joe Pesci
vehicle, is particularly disturbing to me
considering my background in photo-
journalism. Pesci plays Lean Bernstein,
“The great Bernzy,” a freelance pho-
tographer in the 19405‘ who runs
around taking pictures of murders,
fires — basically the tortured souls of
New York. ,

He lives in a rathole of an apartment
and works from late afternoon well
into the evening. Photo junk fills his
apartment. For every dollar he makes,
he seems to spend two to bribe some-
one. A very depressing image for
someone who might work in the same

field.

Pesci’s character is so obsessed with
the job he has that he is unaware of
how depressing his life is until he
meets Kay Levitz (Barbara Hershey), a
nightclub owner who asks Bernstein a
favor.

Levitz got possession of the club
from her deceased husband. However,
a strange man arrives on the scene
and claims to own half of the club.
Levitz wants Bernstein to find out who
he is.

The movie had introduced Bernstein

effectively as we followed him

through one presumably typical night

of work. The effect is strong and sets

up some interesting potential.

Unfortunately, after he meets. Levitz

When going back into the history of
Rock and Roll, some people come to
everyone’s mind — Eric Clapton, The
Who, The Stones, Bruce Springsteen
and a thousand others. But when you
talk about real rock and roll guitar
playing, there are few who have been
at it successfully as long as Ted
Nugent.

Nugent started playing in rock and
roll bands over 25 years ago. In his
early days, Ted played in a band called
The Amboy Dukes. From there he
went on his own and became a great
success with a rock and roll style that
was considered thrash at that time, but
in today’s context would probably not
be considered as radical. With his own
band, he recorded’ such rock and roll
staples as “Stranglehold,” “Cat Scratch
Fever,” and “Great White Buffalo.”

After strumming aroundlin a studio a

THE”  NEW" " ‘   {Octoberi 29, 1992

few years ago, he helped form the
band he now plays with — Damn
Yankees. So what keeps this rock and
roller rollin’ with enough energy that it
seems as if he’s just begun? Well, rock
and roll is not all Ted does. He never
did any drugs or alcohol. And he
spends his free time now with his fami-
ly, and also spends a great deal of his
time in nature, either hunting or just
“being in the woods.” This seems to be
a strange combination for a hard rock-
er who looks and acts as radical as the
day is long.

I was anticipating my interview with
Ted Nugent with pins and noodles.
SF: I understand you just returned from
Africa, how was it?
Nuge: Yes, we just got back from
Africa. It was a real sofari-sogoody!
The entire family went. My daughter
Starr who is 22, my daughtersasha
who is 18, my son Toby who is 15 and

imy youngest son who is 2 years old

and of course my wife Shemane.

SF: How did you get started in this
whole outdoor and hunting thing?
Nuge: I was born in Detroit in 1948
alongside the Rouge River. Many forms
of wildlife lived there, and I don’t
know what it was, but the light was lit
and the ﬂames were fanned and I just
couldn’t get enough of wildlife.

SF: How did the Damn Yankees get
started?

Nuge: Well, I love to play, jam and
collaborate with other musicians. I just
love the spontaneity. I had an opportu~
nity to jam with Tommy Shaw, whose
talents I thought weren’t utilized to
their fullest with Styx. I thought the
same thing when Jack Blades joined us
—— that his talents were being hidden
with Night Ranger. So when we started
to jam I was really driven, and when
I’m driven with something, I go for it.
When I’m not driven, I just drive away.
We jammed for a few hours which

into a few months. It really “wanged
my twang,” and the rest is history.

SF: Which group did you enjoy playing
with the most — The Amboy Dukes,
Ted Nugent or Damn Yankees?

Nuge: Ted Nugent, only because it
allowed me to make certain musical
statements, such as I do in the songs,
“Wango Tango,” “Wang Dang Sweet
Poontang” and “Great White Buffalo.”
But that is nothing derogatory toward
the Damn Yankees. It was just that
extra notch of intensity that I crave so
much that I had with my own band.

SF: I understand you don’t partake in
those vices?
Nuge: (Laughingly) Wait a minute,
back up! The drugs and alcohol I have
never partaken in, but women I did
OD on at one time. BuOt I’m married
now, so that’s all past history.

   The movie immediately puts
3‘.-_ . Bernstein into the Bogart frame
 of mind. The fact that he is a

 photographer becomes unim-

portant for the middle of the
movie. He is no longer the pub-
lic eye but a private eye.

He is shaken over by the Feds
and the mob within minutes of
each other, and, typical of
Bogart movies, the simple

request becomes a much more
complex and important mystery.
Unfortunately, the mystery dies
an early death as the movie
once again decides to try a dif-
ferent slant. The plot becomes
more suspenseful. That runs out
of gas pretty much before it gets

started, and the movie ends on ‘

a ﬂat note as a vain attempt is
made to finish the movie on
some sort of ‘40s melodramatic
theme.

one would find any of this stuff,
except for the first 15 minutes,
interesting. Without the color,
this movie could have been
made in the ‘40s. The only pos-
sible new angle, the photogra-

phy, is woefully dismissed early‘

in the plot.

I am a fan of Pesci, and I do
think he could play lead roles in
movies. This movie is not one
of them. His performance is
decent but hardly makes use of
his particular talents and looks.

His counterpart, Hershey, is
resigned to a terrible role. The
director seems to have paid_ a
lot of attention to her cleavage

THE Irrr NEWS, Thlursday, October 29, 19?_2

and very little to her character.
For all the hinting that the
movie makes that Hershey’s
character is known as a tough,
cold woman, you never even
see a hint of toughness. How
does she run a nightclub, any-
way? The romantic relationship
between her and Pesci is never
convincing, even though it takes
up a large part of the movie.

It seems that The Public Eye
was made to capitalize on the
current popularity of Pesci. But
it you are a fan of his, wait until
Christmas for Home Alonell. It’s
bound to be better than this
loser.

SF: Why did you never
find any interest in drugs
or alcohol?

Nuge: I spit in the face
of alcohol and drugs
because basically I love
me! Anything that has
the potential to f—k me
up doesn’t have a "prayer
in entering my life. 2'
Basically, when I’m
awake I’don’t want to
miss anything; and when
I’m asleep I don’t want
to see anything.

SF: What do you do then
in your free time when
you’re not rockin’ and
rollin’?

Nuge: Well, I try to
spend time with my fam-
ily and I try to coordi-
nate that with things I
have a real passion for
— number one is my W
craving for the spirit of ’
the wild. I love hunting,
wildlife and the out-
doors. I’m fascinated
with conservation and
wildlife in general. And
thus, I founded an orga-

nization called Ted
Nugent World
Bowhunters.

I SF: Can you tell us a lit-
tle more about that?

Slade and the duo guitars of
Angus “Yes, I am a God” Young
and his brother Malcolm,
“Thunderstruck” sets the tone of
the entire 14-track rock set —
bombastic, loud and precise
rock—’n’-roll.

Add the repetitious vocal sui-
cide of Brian Johnson (the
owner of pipes only a grand-
mother could love) and the
underrated bass work of Cliff
Williams, and the killer quintet
is complete. Completely out of
hand!

Keeping with the “out-of-
hand” theme is the brilliant ver-
sion of the title track to the
band’s biggest album Back in
Black. Dominated (what AC/DC
song isn’t) by the omni-awe-
some Young, Blacle amplifies
the precise work of the band as
a whole — employing tight
drums with eerie gang-vocal
and of course, a great guitar
solo by pants—dropping Angus.
To steal from U2 — it’s even
better than the real thing.

Another eardrum buster is the
classic “Hells Bells.” Kicking off
with the doomipatented gong
intro and simmering to head-
banger status with the tight lick-

" work of Mean Mister Young,

“Bells” bowls through the
woofers and tweeters in crisp,
sonic-boom fashion. The
unique sledgehammer yelp of

Johnson doesn’t hurt either.
(Actually it does hurt —— like ﬁn-
gernails on a chalkboard — but
that’s what makes it so killer.)
“T.N.T.” — the quintessential
anthem of deceased AC/DC
singer Bon Scott — gets a digni-
fied second reading (or rasping)
by Johnson. Add the deadly
duo of Young’s cringe-inducing
riffs and the Popeye—ish “oye,
oye!” chant —— and the late-’70s
molten metal jaunt ebbs with a
dark, sinister momentum that
demands foot-stomping. You
may even bite your lower lip.
The end-a1l—be-all teeth-

grinder of LIVE is another song.

sauntered through in satanic
fashion by the late—great Scott,
“Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.”
Like all AC/DC doozies, “Dirty
Deeds” leaves the ground in
raucous rock fashion — a
throbbing bass-drum- beat fol-
lowed by awesome Angus axe-
work. Let’s justsay it’s ﬂat
‘beyond smokin’ — the best live

Weird Nig/9 tma re:
Meditations on Mingus
Columbia Records

Bassist, pianist, composer and
sometime singer Charles Mingus
is arguably the most innovative
composer to emerge in jazz
music since Duke. Ellington.
From the 1950s until the the
early 1970s he composed music
that combined the lush, lyrical
approach of Ellington with the
melodic scope of be-bop and
pushed it to a higher level by
injecting his personal emotions
into it. In the early ‘70s he pub-
lished “Beneath the Underdog,”
his no—holds—barred autobiogra-
phy. ,
Mingus’ albums were person-
al testaments of the demons
within him: ‘racism, the search
for real love and the memories

of his brief time in New York’s
Bellevue Mental Hospital. He
forced his musicians to play
what he heard in his head, by
singing melodies to them rather
than writing them out. During a
song, Mingus would often yell
to a soloist to get the appropri-
ate mood. “Oooh, I know!”
“Hallelujah!” What would be
simple blues by other musicians
became a personal statement in
the hands of Mingus.

Because a Mingus tune is so
idiosyncratic, putting together a
whole tribute album of his " work
was not an easy task, as Hal
Willner found out when he
organized Weird Nightmare.
“Mingus is a complicated sub-
ject,” he says in the liner notes.
“His music has a real street
blues sense, which, with few
exceptions, only seemed to

work when he was present.”

Willner, no stranger to the
“tribute album” genre, previous-
ly produced salutes to Brazilian
composer Nino Rota, jazz
pianist Thelonious Monk and
Walt Disney motion pictures.
But Willner took a different
approach when he organized
Weird Nightmare.

Whereas the other projects
showcased different artists for
each song, Weird Nightmare
employs a “house band” for
almost all the songs with one or
two featured guests.

The credits read like a who’s
who of postmodern music, fea-
turing, among others, guitarists
Bill Frisell and Living Color’s
Vernon Reid (who got his start
playing jazz), clarinetist Don
Byron and percussionists
Michael Blair and Francis
Thumm, who both recorded
with T om Waits. Rolling Stones
drummer Charlie Watts super-
vised two tracks, one featuring
his compadre Keith Richards on
guitar and vocals. '

Willner’s concept doesn’t stop
there. The arrangements incor-
porate instruments built by 20th
century composer Harry Partch.
Partch (.1901-1974) created a 43-
note musical scale which can be
played on instruments such as
the Chromelodeon II, a retuned
pipe organ; Cone Gongs, two
rebuilt nose cones from airplane
gas tanks; and Cloud Chamber
Bowls, large glass Pyrex bowls
suspended from a rack.

Five tracks feature e;cerpts of
Mingus’ book read overtop of
his music. Dr. John, the Band’s

«Robbie Robertson and novelist

Hubert Selby, Jr. are all impres-
sive orators, but Willner was
right on the money when he
got Henry Rollins, the voice of
today’s angry punk youth, and
Public Enemy’s Chuck D to
lend their penetrating voices to
the project.

Weird Nightmare comes off
as such an ambitious project
that it threatens to collapse
under its own weight. It
doesn’t, but not all the songs
work. Bobby Previte’s version

( S.'I‘UDENT half-price tickets, 1/2 hour before show 9

of “Open Letter to Duke,” in
which the original arrangement
is played by a jug band, is a
good idea, but by reducing it to
almost novelty status it loses a
lot of its subtlety, which is a
large part of every Mingus com-
position. “Jump Monk” gets
reduced to a dull percussion
workout.

Keith Richards sounds out of
place on “Oh Lord, Don’t Let
Them Drop That Atomic Bomb
On Me.” His vocal sounds
posed, as if he came to the stu-
dio as a favor to Watts (who
swings like hell) more than
from interest in the project.

The use of Partch’s instru-
ments doesn’t detract from the
proceedings, but they don’t
really’ add anything either.

Because they employ a different,

musical scale, they function
more as sound effects‘ than
musical instruments. They work
well behind Elvis Costello’s
vocal on the title track, but

.overall it is hard to figure

Willner’s reasoning for their
use.

The bizarre elements of the
album are the ones that make it
work. In “Eclipse,” for instance,

' the melody is downplayed in

favor of Diamanda Galas’
whooping vocals and Leonard

 

 

Charles Mingus
Cohen’s eerie recitation of the

»Mingus poem “Chill of Death.”

The piece effectively recalls
the underworld of Mingus’
imagery.

And Willner cleverly links all
the songs together for over an
hour of continuous music on

- compact disc. Each song ﬂows

seamlessly into the next, mak-
ing the whole project sound
like the soundtrack to an actual
weird nightmare.

While Weird Nightmare may

be inconsistent, Willner should
be given credit for taking on

. such an ambitious project and

pulling it off creatively. He
comes very close to recreating
the emotion that could be heard
on Mingus’ own albums, and he
does it by taking a different
route.

Mingus, who was always very
critical of his bands, would be
impressed.

bitchy about it. Musically it flows
between some faster-paced, grunge-filled
rockers to sweet, harmonious vocals and
hook—ﬁlled guitar licks. The strength is
there, but it isn’t threatening. As local
femme fan Mike Shanley says, “Their
sound is primitive and garagy, yet heart-
felt and powerful in their simplicity.”
And more enjoyable than you’ve been

led to believe.

Seam, a quasi-supergroup of Indie
moguls consisting of ex—Bitch Magnet
frontman Sooyoung Park and Merge
boss/Superchunk guitarist Mack, is
slightly less “available” to the mainstream
but so subtly crafted and smart that even
the “in-crowd” is expecting big things
from Seam in the future.

Park on guitars and Mack on drums (a
second instrument he admits he’s an
amateur at) join ex-Lilies bassist Lexi
Mitchell on bass creating a formidable
supergroup that, not surprisingly, sounds
familiarly like a hybrid of Superchunk
and Bitch Magnet. Borrowing the gentle
rock fragmentations and hushed vocals
of BM with the power pop sensibilities
of Superchunk, Seam weaves a subtle
energy onto its debut album Headsparles
on the Homestead label —— a staple of
Indie music since the ‘80s pumping out
albums from Big Black to Big Dipper.
They’re latest tag reads Homestead
Records ‘cause it seemed like a good
idea at the time. A self-mocking gesture
that points to the label’s past strength
and recent ﬁnancial woes.

 ’ RE

ii ‘<3

Headspar/as is a shimmering cathedral
of warm, subtle energy. Ranging from
controlled anger in songs like “King
Rice” and “New Years” to upbeat, yet
short punk anthems like “Shame, “ in
which love rock goddess Sarah Shannon
(of the heavenly Velocity Girl) offers her
ﬂowing voice to the track. The album’s
mood is fragile and delicate, waiting to
erupt, but it rarely does. Instead it just
keeps going, getting catchier all the time
and gaining steadily upon the listener.
Compared to such sparsely dense acts as
Galaxie 500 to the Swans, Seam adds an
extra dimension with psychish pop
grooves here and there and trademark
Indie feedback. “Decatur,” arguably the
album’s finest moment, opens hauntingly

enough, a thump beat quickly "succumbs.

“It’s so hot, I can’ t breathe.” Seam has
suffered from a false branding of “slow—
rock” due to a weak debut single, but
Heacisparles should be all that is needed
to shatter that falsehood. While Seam
may not jumpstart you with speed, it is
powerful enough to cause an overdose.
Local hotshots also get a chance to
shine at this Devil’s Night gig, as Salt
Chunk Mary, Hurl and the Karl
Hendricks Trio, add in their two cents.
SCM, a herky—jerky three—piece outfit
combines all the right moves of punk
rock with the intellectual dig of its post

North Hills, is an obvious fan of Bitch

us- -...;-A-1c..a;o;p¢-_s-...-uu.¢-3.4; n. It sum 2- up -

s——-t from so—called animal
rights’ activists covered by the
media in this country. I figured
if anybody could put a stop to
it, I could. I was tired of hear-
ing the typical, rhetorical,
stuffed-shirt, pomposity para-
noia that has caused such an
unbelievable representation of
what hunters are all about.

SF: Why do you think that this
has happened?

Nuge: The claim by animal
rights’ activists are attractive,
because the concept of death
and pain being done away
with- is highly. alluring.
Unfortunately, it’s a dream.

You can’t manage wildlife

according to a cartoon fantasy,
because if you _do, in the long
run, wildlife.will suffer and be

' .the ultimate loser. A whitetail

deer is not Bambi, an elephant
is not Dumbo and a moose is
not Bullwinkle. And they can-
not be treated as such.

SF: According to your views
on this subject, who do you

support for president? George A

Bush because he is pro—NRA
but anti—enVironment or Bill
Clinton and Al Gore, because
they are pro—environment, but
anti-NRA?

Nuge: That’sa good question,
but I’m going to have to
decline answering that
because I don’t want to sway
anybody’s vote. But I do stress
your right to vote because no
one can take that right away
from you, so it’s worth using.
The American’s right to vote is
the most powerful weapon in
the entire world.

SF: What would you want to
be remembered for 100 years
from now? Your music or your
wildlife endeavors?

Nuge: I don’t think I have a
choice. It will be for a combi-
nation of both. I’m not a great
guitar player and I’m not a
great hunter, but I am a pas-
sionate son-of—a-b—-h whose
beliefs and dedication cannot
be" questioned on both fronts.
My record speaks for itself.(No
pun intended.)  7
