Address On Planning‘

 

Assistant Agriculture Head,
Dr. Ezekiel, To Speak
At Meeting Today

Inquiry Forunfs program for the
current season will reach a climax to-
day, when Dr. Mordecai Ezekiel, as-
sistant secretary of agriculture, ad-
dresses students in Room 301, Alumni
Hall at 12:30 o’clock on the subject,
"lf Planning, What Kind?”

Dr. Ezekiel, drawing upon his back-
ground as an economic analyst
through many administrations in
Wasliiiigton, will discuss the advis-
ability of the entrance of the national
government upon a system of eco-
nomic planning.

Due to limited seating capacity,
students holding tickets, which have
been distributed free of charge, will
be given preference at today’s 1neet-
ing. Those without tickets, however,
will be admitted after 12:40 o'clock,
co-chairman Edward Van Kirk an-
nounces.

Studied Abroad

The speaker, a former New Deal
“braintruster,” assisted in the devel-
opment of the idea of the AAA while
acting as economic adviser to Secre-
tary of Agriculture Henry A. Wal-
lace. Prior to 1933, he was assistant
chief economist for the Federal Farm
Board in the Hoover Administration.

]Ie has had a part in international
policies of agriculture through mem-
bership on the executive committee of
commercial policy and as American
representative at meetings of the In-
ternational Wheat Advisory commit-
tee in London and Rome. The years
1930-31 he devoted to foreign study
under a Guggenheim Fellowship with
the purpose of noting development of

government control in European
countries.
Dr. Ezekiel has written several

books, best known of which is “$2,500
a year — from Scarcity to Abund-
ance,” magazine and newspaper ar-
ticles, and has made frequent radio
appearances. Tonight, at 8:15 o’clock
in Schenley High School, he will speak
at the Community Forum on the sub-
ject, “Government and Agriculture.”

As Speakers At Annual
Peace Day Affair

In conformance with a nationwide
policy of student demonstration in op-
position to war, the Peace Committee
of SFA with the Pitt Peace Coun-
cil will sponsor a Peace Day Assem-
bly in Mcrnorial Hall from 11:30 to
12:30 o’clock on this coming Thurs-
day, April 22.

In order to make room for the As-
sembly all classes on Tltursday have
been shortened by fifteen minutes.

Two speakers have been scheduled
for the program. Dr. Solomon B.
l".r-eeliof, rabbi ‘of the Rodef Shalom
'_|_‘em_ple, will be the guest and main
speaker of the morning. Represent-
ing the student body as speaker is
William Stark, C38, member of edi-
torial board of The Pitt News, and
well known University debatcr.

Immediately following the Assem-
bly, the Peace Council has called a.
student fast lunch by means of which
students may show more vividly their
strong convictions for peace. The
lunch, which will consist of only a
bowl of soup, is to be held in the “Y”
c|ub.rooms on Bouquet street, and will
feature a student discussion on the
future program of the Council. David
MacKenzie, youthful leader of the
_peace movement in England and
Egbert Hayes, of the Emergency
l‘ea.ce Campaign, will be present to
lead the discussion.

All proceeds from the fast will be
used to build up a fund for the 1’_itt
l’eace Council. The money will then
be devoted by that group to the fur-
thering of the educational program
for peace on the campus during the
coming year.

This year’s Peace Assembly is the
third sponsored by the University and

A the fourth nationally sponsored stu-

dent demonstration. The number of
students who will participate in
Thursday’s celebration on the nation’s
campuses has been estimated at about
one million, exactly doubling that of
last year.

Wash-[Day

. —editoria1—- '
ODAY IS MONDAY, WASH-DAY, Bill Henry day, Chet
Smith day. In fact, the day belongs to all the boys who have
been stringing dirty linen from the Cathedral top to Pitt Stadium
on a line‘ that is as weak as it is misplaced.
It began long before an editorial in The News, titled “Exploding
The Myth,” appeared on the day preceding W. Don I-Iarrison’s
resignation from the position of graduate manager of athletics at

the University. The main issue

of that editorial has been com-

pletely side-tracked, and one of the strictly minor points has been
sky-rocketed to ridiculous heights. The News in that piece pled
for just two things: ﬁrst, that since virtually every school in the
country offers subsidies in the form of scholarships or extra aids
to encourage and stimulate students who are unable to secure ad-
vanccd educational instruction and opportunities, the true state of
affairs should be brought to light; second, that the present system
is consistent with good educational ideals, and therefore should be
continued. Neither of these two points has been protested, direct-

ly or indirectly.

Of lesser importance was a statement of the hours it took to
play football the way the public and the institutions themselves
demand that it be played. Immediately, this was construed and
twisted to mean that the situation was a unique one and distinctly
belonging to Pitt, alone. This was deduced by ignoring an impor-
tant phrase which led that particular discussion. It read, “Pitt foot-
ball men, NOT UNLIKE men in the many schools throughout
the country, train ﬁve hours each schoolday and Saturday for
seven months out often." We agree that the part concerning the
actual time spent is overstated to some extent. Actually, the time
spent is over-stated, but substantially, the statement is true. Actual
practice each day takes an average of about two hours. But this
does not include the time spent in going to and from the Stadium,
changing from street clothes to uniforms, taking a shower after

Graduating Cl a s s
To Give Memorial

Cathedral Commons Room
Will Get Cornerstone
From Class Of ’37

 

Selection of the cornerstone of the
Cathedral Commons Room as the
memorial gift to the University from
the class of 1937 was announced Fri-
day by Charles W. Rogers, C37,
chairman of the class memorial com-
mittee.

Serving as a permanent memorial
to the class, the Indiana limestone
block is to be placed four feet above
the ﬂoor on the Fifth Avenue side of
the Commons Room, around the cor-
ner from the elevator lobby.

In explanation of the committee's
choice, Rogers said, “Since the Com-
mons Room is being completed this
year, we feel that it is highly suitable
for this class’ memorial to be placed
there.”

Laying of the cornerstone is tenta-
tively set for June 7, when the Com-
mons Room is scheduled to be com-
pleted. All members of the graduat-
ing class will be given an opportunity
to contribute to the memorial during
Commencement Week.

Committee members who are assist-
ing Rogers are Ted Whitaker, C38;
Alice Lewis, C37; Thyrsa Agness
Amos, C38; Emerson Shideler, C37;
and Theodore W. Biddle, assistant
dean of men, faculty advisor.

Student Establishes Letter
Contact With Member
Of ‘Mutiny’ Colony

By Bill Colkcr

Fletcher Christian in the
Nordhoff and Hall classic “Mu--
tiny" on the Bounty” became a‘
reality for Hugh Purnell, BA39.

The story of the famous mu-
tiny attracted Purnell who, recalling
that Christian and his men settled on
Pitcairn Island, concluded that they
must surely have descendants living
there. “I decided to write to them,”
Purnell related, “and find out what
kind of an existence these people are
living.”

Mail takes five weeks to get there
by fast boat and three months b_v :1
slower ship. It was, therefore, a few
months later when Purnell received
his ﬁrst letter from Richard E. Chris-
tian, chief magistrate of the island,
and a direct descendant of the fame
Fletcher Christian. - »

“Christian seemed willing to corre-
spend with me,” Purnell said, “and l
learned a great deal from his letters,
although they were written with a
disregard for punctuation and use of
tenses.”

“The islanders have no communi-
cation with the outside world,” the
letter stated. “We have a weak wire-
less telegraph that is useful only in
communication with approaching

ships at ﬁve miles range. Oil lamps
are used to light the one-story
houses.”

The island. which is two ,gqu:,;__1-Q

miles in area and four and one-half
miles in circmnferencc, is surrounded
by cliffs 200 to 3.00 feet high, and is
accessible only through Bounty Bay.
When mail comes, the islanders travel
out to the ships in boats to receive
it, for they are the only ones who can
navigate the rocky entrance.
“Outsiders are not wanted on the
island because of i'ts size,” Purnell ex-
plained. “The people‘ wouldn’t be able
to support them. The fact that ani-
mals such as chickens, goats, turkeys,
and ducks are left to run wild on the

island so that they can feed ‘them-
selves is proof of this point.

"When anyone wishes to visit tl1e
island,” Purnell added, “he must get
the permission of the Chief of the
Western Pacific of the British Colo-
nies. If the chief agrees, every adult
on the island must vote on the mat-
ter. If one of them blackballs him,
the person may not land. l’re.<;ent
population is 212, of which 4.5 chil-
dren attend a school that is under the
supervision of an American named
Clark. Clark recently resigned due
to ill l1‘3{llil1. Their education is sim-
ple and is equal to about our fifth
or sixtli grade.”

“There are no taxes,” the letter goes
on to say. “When there is work to
be done, such as road building or re-
pair of buildings, every man does his
share.

“Noam.-rt land,” Christian writes,
“is Henderson Island which is unin-
habited, and from which the people
import all their wood. The scarcity
of lumber on Pitcairn Island is due
to wasteful cutting of a half-century
ago.

Christian States ‘Outsiders
Not Wanted’; Islanders
Play Cricket, Swim

“We have no doctor on the island,”
the letter continues. “We depend on
surgeons from passing ships, and
when medical aid is needed we burn
a beacon at night.”

The islanders have plenty of leisure
time for sports. “Our main sports,"
(.I.hris|;ian_ 1'v3lzites, “are shooting, swim
u1i1'1{;y and cricket. We make our own
cricket sets and practically everyone
has several guns. I, myself, have ‘two
shotguns and three riﬂes. We have
no large animals on the island. We
have some dogs and cats. The only
native animal is a small brown rat
which is inoffensive.

with typical English features, and
taller than average; the majority of
us are six feet or better.

peace with the world.”

University largely through the work
of Wilfred Sklar, IRA-10,-sub-chain
man of the election board.

The machines are due to arrive at
the Hall on 'l‘hnrsda_v afternoon. when
they will be placed ready. for tlie
opening of the polls the following
morning. 'l‘hc macliincs will speed up
the counting so that. the results will
be given to SFA an hour after the
election.

Blue Cards Necessary

The blue cards ﬁlled out during
February 1'egi:rti'ation will be on file
at the polls and only those students
with blue cards will be permitted to
vote. Any student who has not ﬁlled
out one of these cards must do so be-
fore the election.

School of Dentistry students, who
do not have cards, must have identi-
ﬁcation of some kind to permit them
to vote, according to Hubert 'I'eitln—
baum, C37, chairman of the Board.

Music ln The Air

THE MEN’S GLEE CLUB of the University
has just completed what is likely to be the
first of many annual Eastern tours. The choristers
went unheralded; they immediately won the ac-
claim of audiences from Altoona to Atlantic City.

Reports from the latter city indicate that those
whoattendcd the concert at the exclusive Chal-
fonte-Haddon Hall Hotel were enthusiastic about
the boys’ performance. Quoting Adrian W. Ph_il-
lips, publicity manager of the hotel-: “Tlie Pitt
Glee Club is the best that has appeared during a
ten years’ series of choral presentations at the
hotel.” Another Atlantic City critic claimed that
the Pitt organization is the equal if not the su-.
perior of the choral groups belonging to the
largest eastern universities, choral groups that
make extensive tours every year. Praise, how-
ever, extends beyond the tour; the Home ‘Con-
cert, presented a month ago, was called "the fin-
est in years” by local music critics.

We can well be -proud of our Glee Club. On the
basis of this year’s__ record, we hope for an even
more extensive tour next year, a tour that will
justify the excellence of the club’s efforts. For
those who have not already heard the boys‘ sing
and those who desire to hear them sing again, the
Club is scheduled to sing in a combined concert
with the Women’s Choral of the Pittsburgh Col-
lege for Women next Wednesday evening in the
PCW auditorium.—O. G. '

practice, baking sore muscles under a sun-lamp,
taping up other injuries, warming up before the
actual practice begins, waste time that goes with
any large undertaking. Substantially, we still
maintain that we were correct in our claim that
a normal college student is unable to ﬁt outside
employment into a schedule of study, with excess
time consumed in an athletic or other extra-cur-
ricular activity which requires any degree of
effort. That is the point of discussion..

For instance, examine the present strenuous
period for the boys in Cap and Gown. There are

5
.

. the denouement is at hand. To the ladies . . .

few men who have time or energy for outside-

employment after a full schedule of classes and
three or four hours spent each day in rehearsals.
Soon there will be double daily rehearsals, «fol-
lowed by an even more strenuous road trip and
downtown run that will last more than aweek.
Certainly the boys have fun, a great time, and
are better for the experiences they enjoy in such
an activity. But neither physically nor mentally
is the average student equipped to ﬁt outside em-
ployment into that schedule. This goes for de-
bating, publications, and all the "various year-
round activities. Perhaps to some students, a Uni-
versity offers more tn such activities than in the
purely scholastic ones. We have always disputed
the theory that books and books alone are the
only cogs in this complex educational machine.
Books and study provide the framework or .skele-
tion, but the trimmings and polish come with ex-
perience, application of principles, and maturity.
Football, forensics, publications mixed with
books, laboratories, and instruction =make for
a "well-rounded educational program. “De-eni-
phasize!” is the cry of the same people who sit
through wind and rain, who pay exorbitant gate
fees, who rave and cheer like maniacs each fall.
They should be the last to cry for de-emphasiza—
tion. When the competitors themselves cry
“Uncle!” then, and only then, is it time to
change. We learn many more things from foot-
ball than how to win or lose. Such things as co-
ordination, precision, ﬁnessc, the sense of the
spectacular, determination, and many other things
are rich in meaning on stadium turfs throughout
the land. They can be found in undergraduate
publications, in glee clubs, in dramatic produc-
tions. Such things are fundamental and vital. If
we say we should de-emphasize football, should
we not strike at other extra-curricular activi-
ties in similar positions? Football stands on its
own feet, and even assists many other activities
which are unable to support themselves. The
boys like to play, the school likes to see them
play, and many outsiders are interested and con-
cerned. If we remember correctly, it was the
Carnegie Foundation dc-emphasizers and criti-
cizers who caused an even greater inflation of
football than existed before its investigation was
made. -- -

And ﬁnally, to all who point an accusing ﬁnger
in the Pitt direction and say: “Boo! you,.are bad
andcvery one else "is good!”“let ‘us"say' a few
words: Nuts’!!! Football at ‘Pitt is 'ji‘ist‘as it is
in Podunk, in the Big Ten, from the Atlantic to
the Paciﬁc, with the exception that we have snow,
rain, smog, and a few other things to slow up
our’-halfbacks and cut down the hours of day-
light ‘during the regular practice seasons. We
suggest to all the Bill Henrys (the original is a
sports writer on the West Coast) that they check
up on the situation in every section of the coun-
try, and then come out to Pittsburgh, and they’ll
ﬁnd, strangely enough, that it’s just about the
same here. Pitt is merely average.

we apolo-
gize that they were so easily fooled. And special notice
to Miss Thomas, Pitt’s admirable, more beautiful, and
most suspected lady of the year. She almost lost out for
Senior Queen, a nomination which she, if any, deserved,
on Cherchez’ account. But sh_e’s innocent, sisters, honest
she is . . . i E

we still have time to dish up a few more, thanks to
our willing scouts and copywriters. Analyzing the results
of the recent elections we see where‘ the Kappas were
left out in the cold, cold. Their battin’ average, our
statistician reminds, was .000 in five trips to the plate.
Theytell us there's still ower in nuni ers what with
the Thetas and ZeeTAs literally taking all but Maine
and Vermont. We believe the girls from Belleﬁeld scored
five times out of six, while the girls from lower Craig
came home ﬁve in eight. Not Bad, not Bad. Of course
you know COALition, to our fairer members, is some-
thing to be stowed away in a dusky bin in the respec-
tive cellars. ‘ .

McKay Comments
On Wagner  Act

The Supreme Court’s decision on the much-discussed
Wagner Labor Relations Act has stolen some of the
spotlight from the receirt spectacular “sit-down” strikes
in the interest of both students and f,acult.y at the Uni-
versity.

Dr. Marion K. _McKay, professor of economics, has
this to say about the Wagner Bill in general, and the
positions of M1‘.-Foird and Jones and Lauglilin, in par-
ticular, about the subject:

“I feel that Mir. Foi.'d’s statement that he would ab-
solutely refuse ‘to recognize uiiions and collective bar-
gaiiiing in his plants was made on the spur of the nio-
ment. I imagine that he now regrets that statement
very much. The Wagner Bill has fnrcedliis hand. 1
am certain, however, that Ford does have the resources
topproduce his cars without recognition of labor unions.
But public opinion will force Ford to recognize labor
unions and all that they stand for. If he should man-
age to market his cars without recognizing unions, the
Ford dealers all over the country would be unable to
sell the -cars—for the same reason——public opinion.”

Dr. McKay agreed with many other authorities that
Jones and Laughlin would be forced by the decision’to

 

reinstate the ten men ﬁred several months ago because ' 
He stated that Jones and Laughlin  

of union activity.
and all the other large steel corporations must recog-
nize the trends thatvlabor is following. ,The decision
of the Supreme Court favoring the Wagner Bill only
clariﬁes these trends.

When questioned concerniiig the decision itself. Dr.

McKay said: A “The Supreme\Coui:'t justices, being liu--

manelike the rest of us, have recognized the fact that
tl'iei.r,deCisions must be rendered in the light of these
new progressive trends. The recent criticism of the
Court’ by the p1‘CSl(l(".lTt -and his followers has stirred
them into action. and they are now giving decisioiis more
in the spirit. of progressivisin. _ .

"They are 110t bending over backwards, however,
merely because of this adverse criticism, but situations
have arisen that make it possible for the Court to show
that they are really taking cognizance of which way
the wind is blowing." »

as Party ReCO3l'I|tlOl'I—
THE. INDEPENDENT Party in another sec-

tiori‘ on this page declares itself today. By this
gesture it stamps itself as the first group in re-
cent undergraduate political history to come out
in public with a concrete platform of premises
and policies. This is a stimulating and progres-
sive move in student political circles that have
previously harbored groups of students whose
operations and lines of -actionhave been both
mysterious and questionable‘.

Student government on this campus has‘ long
needed healthy organization by the students, with
deﬁnite programs and aims that would just-ify the
existence of student government. One’ person or
two persons can do little good under our present
system of government. It is only by collective
organization that measures can be put into effect.
The ideas of one person are worthless unless that
person can convince a sufficient number of other
students that the idea is one well-worthwhile and
necessary. _

When the various groups distribute their slates
of candidates by Friday of this week, students
will be asked to vote for blocks of students for-
the most ridiculous and unimportant reasons. If,
however, the slates are passed out with the un-
derstanding that a vote for that particular ticket
means that the candidates listed thereon will ini-
tiate and promote the particular legislation as*de- _
clared in the party platform, the candidate will
be obligated to carry out those promises, and
thus the voter will receive something in return
for his support. ‘

» A student government can do much goodif it
carries out the letter and spirit of its‘constitu-
tion_ by functioning for the good of. the students.
of the University. It is up to the candidates and
party members to formulate policies that will
promote that trust.’The News shall be-happy to
print the platform of any political party that is
organized to function for the good of the stu-
dents of the University.

By Albert Lasda-y

A man six feet tall wants to view his entire height in
a mirror; If the mirror hangs vertically at the most.con-
venient height and the man stands erect, what is the
shortest mirror in which he can see himself from the
top of his head to the bottom of his feet? The problem
is‘ simpliﬁed if it is assumed that the man’s eyes are four
inches below the top of his head," although the ﬁnal an-
sweris the same no matter what ‘this distance may be.

The man’s distance from the mirror has no bearing on
the problem. The reader can prove this for himself by
a simple -but very surprising home experiment. If a mir-

front of it with his eyes level, no matter how he varies
his distance from the mirror, he will always see same

area in it. (See answer in Wednesday’s News.)

This group has been organized with the sole
aim and purpose of providing fair and equal op-

of preventing domination of student govern-

stituting only 15 per cent of the student body.

We are attempting to secure fair representation "

for the other eighty-five per cent.

Pit.t’s 1938 squad has a long ways

,to “go before I it will even be ,..;1'ea.dy.

to give‘ Ohio Wesleyan a good "game
come next fall. 7 _~,i{.

Satmjday past on the practice. field,
some .75. .-friends and boost_er_s»i-took a
sideline glimpse of the Blues -' and

.Whites in the second week-e'n_d_ clash

of the .spring training sea'so'1_i'."

The game.sta.r.tcd much like the
opening practice game of the preced-
ing week when the boys played
through two l1ours_of-"football before

day, niiieteen: men were ‘ _‘tappedf. to‘ "A
_lioi1oijai'y mii1_- .

On that *play, coming. in t'I1‘,e_7-’1‘n‘iddle
of what miglit."“l)e" called the. second‘
period," Goldberg, who should be tradi’-.'
tion=ar0und here for the nextcoupla
years, drove through a’-big" gap on
the right side of the »WlllteS’ linc,
picked his way e:~:pert_l_y downﬁeld, and

iioohletl out into‘ pay country to score
-on _a.4v(J_--y:.u‘d touchdown dasli.
..  I Not a hand was laid on the" Elkiiis

Express during that dash," and
strangely, few men in. the secondary
were spilled on the playi Screening
and Goldberg’s ﬁne change of pace
did theTtric . ‘" ‘- ~. ’

Botli teams smashed the afternoon
out. Coordination‘ and ﬁnesse ' just
weren’t there, but they played hard
and gave indication that improvement
should come with time and practice.

Acting Captain Matisi for the
Blues made a tactical error to start
the game when he elected to take the’
goal againsttlie wind after Acting
Captain Frank Soucliak of the Wliites
had elected to receive. Soucliak, by
the way, played a whale of a ball
game, and was possibly -the outstand-
ing man on the ﬁeld witli'liis smash-
ing defensive play. 

Soucliak, the burly one from Ber-
wick, bumped into Bill Daddio’s sec-
ond attempt for the extra point, and
thrice pulled down an opposing ball
carri‘er for substantial losses.‘ Petro
slammed into Soucliak on the open-
ing return of Matisi’s kick-oﬁ’ to put

the ball in play on the 25-yard
stripe. The Blue line couldn’t be
moved, and Patrick was forced to
kick. ‘

The game see-sawed, with Patrick
getting the better of a kicking duel
with Stapulis. After some 30 min-
utes of play, with neither team regis-
tering a ﬁrst down, the Blue wave
began to move, with Stapulis driving
through for a first and ten. Stebbins
followed up, and then made it three
in a row when he whipped a ﬂat pass
to Chickerneo in White territory.

On the next play, Goldberg paced

.1

Practice Tilt

his way 40 yards for the first touch-
down of the afternoon. With Stebbins
holding the ball, Daddio’s place—kick
just grazed Soucl1ak’s charge, and the
score read 7-0 for anyone that was
interested.“ Later that period, after
Goldberg and St-apulis had driven
past the mid-stripe, Stebbiiis hit his
"’mark again, and this time Goldberg
l}0‘Oli_tl'lO pass for a touchdown, brii1g-
ing the count to 13-0.

“ -Frequent substitutions were made
at the beginning of the third period,
and John Michelosen, who was held
out of scrimmage due, to a back in-

jury, called the plays'_f’o'r'Kisli’, frosh
