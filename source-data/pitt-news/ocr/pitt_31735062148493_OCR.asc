‘No-Politics’
Plan to Reach
SPA Assembly

Scholars’, Statistics
Committee Chairmen
To Present Reports

What may turn out to be one
of the most heated discussions in
the history of the present Stu-
dent—Faculty Association is on
tap for tomorrow evening’s reg-
ular meeting, where a climax to
the latest campus “political com-
plications” is expected to be
reached.

Because of the recent Fraternity
President’s Council-sponsored “no-
politics” plan of the campus soror-
ities, many diversiﬁed ideas on the
plan which might possibly sabotage
the men and Women’s coalition, are
almost certain to be brought out at
the ﬁrst meeting of the association
in the new semester.

Revision Suggested

The plan, which was .“vo1untarily
agreed” upon by a large majority
of the campus sororities, according
to-’Helen Wilson, C40, president of
FPC, has come in for a great deal
of comment, pro and con.

Another possibility for an “inter-
esting” discussion is the idea of an
entirely. different student govern-
ment set-up. It is most probably
that a revision in the present organ-
ization will be under ﬁre,-accord-
ing to student political observers.

At the recent executive meeting,
the campus campaign for funds for
the Russo—Finnish». sufferers . was
agreed. upon by the provost of the
U iversity, Rufus H. Fitzgerald,
who sent a letter to SFA, emphatic-
ally V endorsing “ the proposed . plan,
which calls for the placing of boxes
throughout the ‘- University ‘ This

would .61,-table students to contribute

donations individually. 

Scholars’   . - .
Previously the executive commit-

tee had decided to formulate plans

so, that the students in the evening

division would also have an oppor--

tunity of donating to the fund. Ted,
Starzynski, C40, was slated as
chairman of the campus campaign.

Also on the calendar are two
committee reports: one from the
statistics committee and the other
from the Scholars’ Day committee.

FPC will Hold
Meeting Today

The Fraternity Presidents’ Coun-
cil, which two weeks ago dropped
the “no-politics pledge" into the
campus political picture, will meet
today at 1’ o’clock‘. in the twelfth
ﬂoor conference room.

Helen Wilson, C40, president of
the “discussion group,” could not
be reached Friday for, an authori-
tive opinion as to whether the im-
portant sorority question will be
discussed today. However, campus
political observers will watch with
unusual interest this meeting—the
first formal meeting of the group
since the “Ash vWednesday an-
nouncement.”

“Much ofthe painting is done as

Use “Municipal
interns’ Plan

Mayor Scully Plans
To Employ Graduates
On Cooperative Basis

By William L. Klinkenstcin

Proposal by Mayor Cornelius
D. Scully of a “municipal in-
ternes” plan has brought to the
fore records
grams in effect at other univer-
sities. A check-up of ﬁles re-
veals that ﬁve cities and three states
started programs of nearly identical
nature in the past few years.

The civil service assembly of the
United States has reported that New

V York city, San Diego and Glendale,

Calif., Saginaw, Mich., and Port-
land, Ore., have launched training
programs. The states of Wisconsin,
and Indiana have ap-
pointed college graduates to appren-
tice positions in the state adminis-
tration.

Cincinnati Pioneers

One of the earliest universities to
work in cooperation with actual
governmental agencies in providing
training for its students was the
University of Cincinnati which in-
augurated courses in the year
1927-28.

Courses are given on a coopera-
tive basis with the city and the
county. Only graduate students are
selected for the course, and they are
employed by the government agen-

cies on a half-time basis, receiving

salaries-ofifrom $450 to $600 for
their work each year.
lawyers, -non-technical students and

. public welfare students are given

work in their respective ﬁelds. A
American and George Washing-

ton universities offer plans "of a '

sornvewliat different nature. Located
in -Washington,’ D. “C., they‘"provide
courses for government workers
who plan to advance themselvesby
further education.

The course in government service
given at the University of Washing-
ton covers ﬁve years of academic
work. During one quarter of the
ﬁnal year, students work in some
department of state or local gov-
ernment, reporting weekly to their
superiors.

New York Uses Plan
Another city which has used the

“municipal internes” plan to ‘a great. .

extent is New York, which selects
some 35 senior students from the
college of the City of New York
and Brooklyn, Queens, and Hunter
colleges for summer work in munic-
ipal government. A

In addition to plans brought forth
by municipal and state govern-
ments, the Federal government an-
nounced last year that it would be-
gin an educational program for the
employees of the 175,000 governing
bodies in the country.

Wednesday night, February 23;’

almost one year after the inaugura-
tion of the drive to raise funds for
a ﬁtting testimonial to “Jock,” Emil
Narick, BA40, chairman of the com-
mittee, again called its members to
action. They decided. upon a
‘plaque, inscribed with Dr. Suther-
la.nd’s'name and his record at the
University. Pending another meet-
ing of the committee, this decision
will rest as ﬁnal."

Why the change? Why not a tes-
timonial room? “Close to $700”
was raised instead of the intended
$7,500. . .

The, money is now in the careof
Dr. Jules Labarthe Jr., a senior In-
dustrial Fellow, and a member of
the committee.

Contributions for the proposed
t.<::st.i.mr>r.ial room fund were solicited
from University students and fac-
ulty, and from University alumni
over an extended period last spring.
During the summer, activity on the
project died out.

To Engineers: a Note
From the Editor

“The News has always been open to the letters
and other contributions of University students and
faculty rnembers . . . If you have something to say,
let us know about it. ‘~7Vc’re anxious to ﬁnd out
what Pitt students and faculty think, and glad to
publish your opinion-::—:.”

This statement. in an editorial in last Wed1ies-
day’s Pitt News inspired the letter in today’s “In
the Mail” column, a note from an Engineering
senior who believes that the boys in State and
Thaw halls have been neglected by the News.

We were glad to receive this letter, for it brings
into the open a problem which has troubled News
staffs for years: H.ow ca11 certain divisions of the
University be covered completely in the News
when the staff has no student sources of in-
formation ‘.3 '

This problem is n.ot peculiar to the Schools of
Engineering and Mines. It applies also to the
Schools of Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Law,

and several other special.ized divisions of the

University. _,

. Typical of our problem in other divisions is the
situation of the News in the Schools of Engineer-
ing and Mines. Not one student in these two
schools is active on the staff of the News. Not one
Engineering or Mines student even furnishes infor-
mation regularly to the News.

- In spite of this situation, our reporters have
managed to cover most Engineering and Mines
activities through the _principal school and depart-
Inental ofﬁces. Si.nce this semester’ has started,

every issue of the News has included at least one“
ex-

article concerning Engineering activities
clniisively. . .. I .
 The News would like to’ report the affairs of En-
gineer-ing' and other schools and divisions more
completely than will ever be possible with our ‘pres-
ent staff of College and Business Administration
students. But weican’t do this without help.
Here’s the formula which we suggest to Engi-
 : .
 When you have newsworthy information,

come to the News office, 825 Cathedral, or tele-‘

phone or mail us theifacts. , _

‘Road to War’

At Dartmouth ,

 Reprinted here is an editorial from The Dart-
mouth, daily newspaper of Dartmouth college,
déscribingiorle aspect of America’s relation to
the wars:

‘It has been four months since war broke out in
Europe and since Dartmouth undergraduates be-
gan to speculate on what forces would help carry
them down the path which the ‘generation before
them had begun to travel in 1914. Those specula-
tions led to cognizance of the dangers which await-
ed all of usvduring the duration of the War.

Alarming,  much for the fact that it went un-
mentioned in those_ early speculations as for the
fact that it is extremely potent, is the influence of
members of the Dartmouth faculty. In those four
montlis, no single factor has been more important
in preparing the minds of undergraduates to seize
the opportunity to slaughter themselves and their
heritage than membersof the faculty.

Prof. Rosenstock-Huessy, attaching a metaphy-
sical, almost a theological signiﬁcance to the war,
tells his  and his followers that American
youth must sacriﬁce itself for the mistake which a
previous generation made when it refused to take
part, in the League of Nations peace. Like the
I:heol.ogy of the ancients, like the mystical. beliefs
of the past, Prof, Rosenstock—Huessy indicates that
blood will wipe away sin.

Other Dartmouth professors have been less de-

termined, less incomprehensible; are nevertheless,
and -sometimes unconsciously doing their part. To-
day four .faculty members, in the vox-populi col-
umns, announce their support of the drive for
F.in_nish relief, and incidentally deplore the critical
attitude of the undergraduates toward the right
and wrong of war. To lend support to a nation
whose life is threatened by an aggressor is a man ’s
own business. To ask undergraduates to stop
searching for the political connotations of the
Finnish war, to stop being critical of the factors
behind war, is to lend support to an emotional basis
ofdeter1i1i1‘1at'ion far more dangerous, because more
subtle, than raucous and easily recognizable War-
mongering.
A Today, while Dartmouth students look back to
the days of peace when its faculty wrote, argued
and preached that only the few, the innocent and
the naive went to war for ideals, members of the
;:same faculty are slowly and surely shifting their
point of view. ‘ _

The things they preached to us as truths in days
when war seemed far away, in China, or in Spain,
before the emotional horrors of the words “com-
munism” or “fascism” had held the headlines for
four successive months, they now ask us to forget,
to cease even to inquire. And as surely as they
shift their own viewpoint, members of the faculty
are carrying Dartmouth’s undergraduates down
the road to another great and futile slaughter.

Common Sense
‘Stop ifloleratirtg

Communists’ —-Zishiud»

By “Senator” Ziskind

We must stop tolerating the American Communist.
Heretofore, we have been extremely lenient toward him,
and rightly so, because we recognized his right to ad-
vocate social reform and political change. But he is
1'-40 1011891‘ this person working within the spirit and
practice of American standards to which he, at least,
pretended to adhere. He has, instead, become a mere
agent of Soviet Russia and is out to spread its gospel
with complete disregard for the welfare of the United
States.

The Communist element is publicly on record as
supporting the Soviet in its “counter-attack” upon
Finland. It is in complete sympathy with the S0viet’s
alliance with Germany and seizes all occasions avail-
able to denounce the “Allied imperialist war.” So fer-
vent has this blind pursuit of Stalin’s acts become, that
the Communist cannot be trusted to support his own
country in time of trouble.

France has been forced to expel sixty Communists
from its own Chamber of Deputies because they gave
comfort to the enemy. Some French Communists fled
to Russia before the war began and now divulge
military secrets for Hitler"s use. These, mind you, the
same Communists who six months before were criti-
cizing the Daladier Government for not taking a ﬁrmer
stand against Germany.

Swedish Lone Ranger

Even in the Swedish Parliament, where the entire
country is imperiled by Russia’s invasion of Finland,
where thousands of Swedes rush to enlist in the Fin-
nish army, and heavy sacriﬁce is made in contribu-
tions of food, clothing, and money—a lone Communist
sits in the Swedish Parliament shouting deﬁance and
ridicule for his Government’s permission in letting this
help ‘get through.

Here in the United States, though in a small minor-
ity, the Communists seized the reigns of ‘the American
Youth Congress and, by keeping the organization from
expressing sympathy for Finland, tainted the whole

V youth movement with red. I can see these Communists

now congratulating themselves on a “grand job.” They
had carried out ’Moscow’s orders. They had humiliated
American youth. They had booed our President. They
had succeeded in “embarrassing” Mrs. Roosevelt, who
had shown them a hospitality and kindness never be—_
fore exempliﬁed in the Youth Congress’s existence.

Liberty For Whom?

Little wonder that the American Civil Liberties
Union has expelled Communist membership from its
ranks. Indeed, they were confronted with a pathetic
paradox ‘when Communists were ﬁghting for civil

. liberties at‘ home and giving support to the obliteration
of all freedom abroad. It became only too evident that

Communists wanted the’ “civil liberties” to some day A

destroythe civil liberties for all groups.

These conniving Communists, who have no country
but the Soviet Union, who have no leader_but Com-
rade Stalin, who have no ﬂag but that of the hammer
and sickle, have no place in American life. They are
the self appointed “intelligence corps” of the blunder-

‘ ing Russian army. I

I am only too glad to have dissenters within ‘the
United States, who in all honesty and sincere devotion
to patriotic duty espouse changes in our social system.
But the Communist, who acts in league with a foreign
country, is a menace to our freedom.

‘Nine Pretty Old Men’

Selection Questioned

By Gene Pyle and Beth Hughes

The “Nine Most Eligible Men. at Pitt” are being
referred to as “The Nine Pretty Old Men,” Very ﬁtting
———eh what‘? By the way, what happened to Marshall
(Glamour Boy) Nesbitt in the‘ list of eligibles? It‘ is
rumored that he is much chagrined!

Jean Daker and Jane Coll are two new members in
the ranks of the pinned. Jean has Johnny Dickinson’s
Phi Delt pin, and Jane recently landed the invincible
Jack Eitel and his Phi Gam badge. ,

Kitty Lou Haughton, long the object of fervent
glances from the male populace, goes steady with a
boy from ‘home (Mt. Lebanon.)—his name being Kike
Singhouse. Too bad, boys. -By the way, Joe Robert’s
description of his ideal date sounded surprisingly like
Aggie Robertson, his, at intervals, Heart-beat.

Ex-Romance? A I p —
‘In the realms of breakups—Hal Porter and Ruth
Steeb, constant companions for four years—they de-
cided on a change of scenery——-Porter was at Heart Hop
with Lois Belle Pryor, and Ruth was with an unidenti-
ﬁed male. Too bad! '
Watch out for Thursday—a big scoop on campus.
It all concerns a certain section of the female popu-
lation at Pitt-——and is another certain section of said
population going to be surprised! Just wait and see.
Seen in the Tuck Shop—Wa1t Lovett and Florence
Ragan talking over locks and keys-—we wonder. Mary
Sefton, Bill Edmund’s steady from the University, of
West Virginia, was in town for IF. They also saw
“Gone” on Saturday, and Bill was unhappy when Mar
was “Gone” on Sunday. Pretty awful eh? - —

Engineers Forgotten, I
ME Senior Says
Editor, the Pitt News: . -A

You asked for it, so h-ere it is.
Last Wednesday in an editorial you
stated that you were “anxious to
find out what Pitt students think.”
“Well, Pm going to tell you what I
and about 99 per cent ofithe en-
gineering students think about the
Cathedral’s Pitt News. You have
forgotten that there is a very deﬁn-
ite part of the University called the
School of Engineering. Don’t blame
it on the snow drifts, for we could
have all starved. to death from the
lack of recognition and publicity
years ago.‘ ,

I have been around here for four
years now and all I’ve read about
is Jack Hoeveler, Joe and Frank
Kristufek and Joe McC_orme1ey. I
don’t know who these dudes are
(maybe I’m missing something)’ and
what’s more I don’t give a damn

, who they are and neither does the

A majority of the engineers. _ ,

L. Granted that the college boys and
biz—adders don’t give a hoot about
theengineering school, but in all

' fairness I think that we on the hill
rate a little more space in the News.
Until we do get more attention you
can announce to the Cathedralites
that when there is a shortage of
I‘§'ews’ elsewhere there is always
plenty at State Hall-—never touched.

English Collegians Cut Classes
AtIiW ill but Must Stay in Nights

SYRACUSE, N. Y.—— (ACP)—-
“English universities are more con-
cerned about students’ ‘nights of
residence’ than about their ‘days of
attendance.’ ” .

So says Dr. A. McKinley Terhune
of the Syracuse University English
department, who -recently returned
from a year in Cambridge, England.

Class attendance is not required,
and no records are kept, but rules
ﬁxing students’ night hours, are
rigid, he said. Gates of the colleges
are closed at 10 p. m. and lodging
house door and windows l.ocked at
the same hour. Cambridge and Ox-
ford students are then ﬁned for in-
fraction of the rule.

Three’ Year Course

A central office to dispense in-
formation is non-existent in English
universities. The only source of in-
formation is the university calendar,
whose contents have so accumulated
through the years as to present a
confused mass of data which Dr.
Terhune calls “as helpful as an un-
abridged dictionary.”

The English course of .study is
only three years. The college year
is divided into three semesters,
each containing of approximately
10 weeks, known as Michaelmas,
Lent, and May semesters.

Students take only one subject,
although brilliant" students may take
two. A student hands in a weekly
paper to his tutor, who discusses
it with him. Examinations are con-
ﬁned to one at the end of each year,
the ﬁrst two being merely “warm-
ups,” with the third year’s known
‘as the “tripos,” being the most dif-

 ﬁcult and important of all.
Formal Dress

ﬁnscontrast to the American pro-
cedure, English universities have
jurisdiction solely over academic

‘ rn‘atte‘rs, the “colleges” roughly con-
‘trolling the social" life of the stu-
dents. he said.

“Students must wear caps and
gowns at all university appoint-
ments, including dinner, and after
dark to distinguish them from
townspeople,” he stated in pointing
out the contrast in formality‘ of
dress in English institutions.

Town ordinances do not apply to
students, and the universities main-
tain their own police systems to

deal with lawbreakers, Dr. Terhune
mentioned. I

When questioned about the place
of wom-en'in English universities,
Dr. Terhune said that their status is
inferior to the position. occupied by
men. Although the amount of work
requisite to a degree is the same
for both sexes, women’s degrees are
not so highly credited as men’s.

Sidelines

With Bill McElwain
Sports Editor

Editor’s note: This is the second in a series of articles about the
Big Ten, its history, organization, and its rel.atz'on to the University of
Pittsburgh. >

By th.e early “nineties,” athletics, keeping pace with the rapid
expansion of mid-western colleges and universities, had advanced to
a position where regulation was necessary.

Athletic engagements, then conﬁned to football, basketball, and
track, consistently ended in riots. Playing rules were few and vague
and eligibility requirements were practically unheard of. It was
the day of the tramp athlete, and a school ’s success often depended
on how many professional players it had in the lineup.

Something had to be done, and the "presidents of seven institu-
tions met at Chicago on January 11, 1895, to attempt to do it. The
group set up an organization, which was to consist of appointed fac-

ulty representatives, to regulate and control intercollege athletics,
and also formulated a brief set of rules.

Conference “Just Growed”

The following winter the representatives of Minnesota, VVis-
consin, Illinois, Northwestern, Purdue, Michigan, and Chicago met
in the Palmer house in Chicago. — VVith the exception of Amos
Alonzo Stagg, athletic director at Chicago, all of the original repre-
sentatives were not primarily connected with athletics at their re-
spective schools.

Like Topsy, the conference “just growed” for there never
has been a written constitution adopted. Various rules have been
added from time to time, and the conference has preferred to take
care of individual changes as the need arose.

In 1898 the conference adopted a set of rules which more
clearly outlined the eligibility requirements, provided for the deci-
sion of what constituted a recognized college, improved the rela-
tions between the conference and local athletic boards, and deﬁned
whatﬂthe legitimate athletic expenses of a school might be.

A! year later Iowa and Indiana entered the conference, and
in 1901 the ﬁrst conference track and ﬁeld meet was held. In the

meantime football had gradually replaced baseball as the chief var-

sity sport, and Michigan, VVisconsin, and Chicago were developing
teams nearly equal to those of the East.

Football Schedule Reduced

After the 1905 season had resulted in considerable criticism
of the excessive roughness in football (Northwestern dropped the
sport for two years) the football rules committee made sweeping
changes in an effort to reduce the danger in the game, a move with
which the conference’ was heartily in accord.

In 1906 the conference voted to limit playing careers to three
years after one year of required. residence, end intercollegiate play
by freshman teams, abolish the training table, and cut the football
schedule to ﬁve games, less than half of the then usual number. The

latter rule was revised in 1908 to allow seven games, and now stands
at eight.

Michigan, forced to drop several eastern rivals by the schedule
slash, objected and ﬁnally withdrew from the conference in 1908,
not returning until -1917 when it‘ was invited to again becomea

member. The last addition to the conference was in 1912 when
Ohio State accepted an invitation. . V

Conference Medal. Awarded

The question of what gave a baseballlplayerra I-professional

standing was much discussed and legislated upon between 1905 and .

1920, and it was only in 1922 that the conference decided that the
test should be whether or not admission had been charged for non-
collegiate games in which the athlete had participated.

Two other events of importance between 1910 and 1920 should
be mentioned. In 1914-. the Conference Medal was ﬁrst awarded.
This goestto one senior at each conference school who, ‘during the
year, has shown the greatest proficiency in scholastic work and
athletics. < : -

Because of the lllorld War and the increasing number of men

who were enlisting, the conference voluntarily handed over its full’
athletic facilities to the war‘ department‘ for a few months in 1918-

Since then the conference athletic program has expanded stead-
ily, and now, -although Chicago dropped football after last season,

the conference has ten schools participating in twenty or more
sports. -

Week-End [Results
F errara Cracks Old 440 Mark
In University Championships

Varsity trackmen set four new records and tied two old ones Satur-
day in the eighth annual University championships at the track house.

Frank Ohl in the broad jump, Dave McDowell in the high jump, shot
putter John Bazyk, and quarter miler Al Ferrara registered record break-
ing performances. '0 .

Ferrara’s 52.8 seconds dash in the 440 was the most remarkable event
of the day, considering the unusuallypsoggy condition of the track. In nos-
ing out Larry Tregonning, Ferrara ‘
broke Freddy Kiger’s ﬁve year old

and Herb Cosgrove and Hymie

did the passing

mark by one tenth of a second. Tre-
gonning tied the former, record.
A leap of 23 feet 51/2 inches was

three inches better than Ohl’s own-

record of last year, while Bazyk
cracked his own shot put standard
by 15,inches, ‘heaving the 16 pound
ball 49 feet 1% inches.
usurped Pete Benn.ett’s spot as high
jump king by clearing the car at 6
feet .321/2 inches.

Records were tied in the 50 yard

. low hurdles and the 50 yard dash

when Happy Stickel skimmed the
barriers in 6 seconds and Bill Car-
ter took the 50 in 5.4. Dusty
Rhoades was on his way to a new
pole vault mark when Red Jessup
sprained his ankle after a 12 foot
attempt and the event was halted.

Bill! Morton led the freshmen
competition with ﬁrsts in the 50, the

. two lap, and the 440 yard dashes.

Swimmers Win, 42-33
Pitt’s swimming team gave a pre-
view Saturday of the Eastern Inter-
collegiate championships next
month by whipping Franklin and
Marshall, defending champs, 42-33,
at the Metropolitan club pool.
Milt Lederstein won both the 220
and 440 yard free style events for
the Panthers. Al Beacon and A.l

Slobodian ﬁnished one-two in the A

150 yard back stroke, as did Dick
Amos and Joe Kaule in the diving,

McDowell '

Lederstein in the 200 yard breast
stroke. 2
Beacon, Cosgrove-,~ and Slobodian
teamed to take the 300 yard medley
relay in the slow time of 3 minutes
10 seconds. F and M’s sprint star,
Miller, ﬁnished ﬁrst in both the
50 and 100 yard dashes, then joined
team mates Gager, Macionis, and
Kachel to cop the 400 yard relay.

Tech Upsets Carlsonmen

Coach Cliff Ca.rlson’s up-and-
down Pitt basketball team was

down Saturday evening and under-

dog Carnegie Tech tripped the
Panthers, 46-44, after an uphill bat-
tle on the Skibo court. Pitt led 30-
23 at the half; ’

A ﬁeld goal by Jim Tumpane in
the ﬁnal seconds of play gave Tech
the winning edge. iTumpane’s shot
boosted his total to 11 points for the

game.

Randall Burch paced the Tartans
with 13 points on six ﬁeld goals
and a foul, as Bob Stark, high scor-
ing center, was held to two ﬁeld
goals and ﬁve fouls. Mel Port was
high man for the Panthers with
ﬁve ﬁeld goals and six fouls for 16
tallies. 9

Eddie Straloski and Sam Milan-
ovich, who between them scored 41
points against West Virginia last
Tuesday, were held to one point, a
foul shot by Straloski.

 Both Groups Capture Four  Places; I 
in Phil Kaps Walk Away with Basketball Title

_ By John Chaffo V b
By taking four ﬁrsts each, the Delta Tau Delta and Phi Gamma Delta
intramural teams 1 Virtually walked away from the rest of the fraternity
ﬁeld during the past year, according to reports publishedby the intra-

mural ofﬁce today.

The Delts captured the top positions in horseshoes, table tennis, golf,

and tennis while the Phi Gams took
titles in swimming, i volleyball,
touch football and speedball.

In table tennis the Delt team
banked heavily upon Fuchs, Miller,
and Hergenroder to carry the load.

The Phi .Gams were led in all
their touch football victories by the
touchdown partners, Bill Edmunds
and Chris Wat-
son. The ‘latter

Coldspot Team
Defends Lead

The ﬁrst place Coldspots stake
their lead in the freshman basket-
ball league Wednesday when they
tangle with the high-riding Polar
Bears. In the second game the
Seals and the Defrosters will -ﬁght
it out. 1 V ' 

The Polar Bears, who have won
two games and lost one, stand a
good chance to advance to ﬁrst
place as they meet the Coldspots,
who have played only the Penguins.

If Malarkey, star forward, plays
for the Defrosters, the second game
should prove interesting, as the
Seals and Defrosters are evenly
matched and are tied for third place
with one game won and one lost for
each team.

sweepstakes both went to the Phi
Delta Theta squads, the Phi Gams
ﬁnishing in the number two, posi-
tion on both occasions.

Again in handball, both the Delts
and the Phi Gams were barely
nosed out. The Kappa Sigs won. the
title with the athletically strong
Fijis in the runner-up role.

The other tests in which the two
“major powers” were defeated ‘were
bowling and mushball. Pi Kappa
Alpha won the bowling and the
Sigma Alpha ,Mu boys took _the
mushball title.

In speedball ‘and swimming the
Phi Gams again led the ﬁeld, win-
ning both events with little trou-
ble. The Delts were forced to be
content with second place in speed-
ball and third in swimming.

Tennis and golf went to the Delta
Tau Delta athletes who ﬁnished
ahead of Phi Delta Theta in the
former and Phi Gamma Delta in
the latter. ‘ '

All candidates for varsity base-
wball must secure eligibility cards
., before reporting for practice, ac-

cording to Coach Ralph Mitterling.
Cards may be obtained from Ken
George on the twenty-seventh
ﬂoor, Cathedral of Learning.

Practice sessions are being held

every day at the Stadium for bat-
terymen, and a call will be issued
for inﬁeld aspirants at a later
date, announced Mitterling.

U niversity’s Rejection of Spring
Grid Game Brings ‘Red’ Charge

By Hiram Milton

Ugly rumors hinting that Com-
munist inﬂuences are at work on
the twenty-seventh floor have fol-
lowed on the heels of the negative
attitude adopted by University
athletic oﬁicials toward a spring
football game for the Finnish re-
lief fund.

Coach Charley Bowser, athletic
director Jimmy Hagan, and public-
ity director Frank Carver were
unanimous in their rejection of the
plan proposed by Chet Smith, sports
editor of the Pittsburgh Press, who
who would pit Pitt (double talk)
against either Duquesne’s Dukes or
West Virginia’s Mountaineers.

While Pitt officials based their re-
jection on the contention that spring
is the time to practice football
fundamentals and not to engage in
intercollegiate contests, authorita-
tive sources have it that the twenty-
seventh ﬂoor was merely following
the Communist party line in nixing
the suggested pre—season battle.

Usually reliable informants hint-

ed that certain University oﬁicers
had been interviewed by an emis-

sary of the Russian government,
and that after the conference, the
Pittmen asserted that Smith was a
bourgeois semi-fascist, that the Pitt
Panthers would be known next sea-
son as the Soviet Reds, and that lec-
tures on Marxian theory will re-
place winter meetings of the football
squad.

It is believed in informed circles
that a bag of gold was tucked into
the pocket of each of the athletic
staff after the meeting. However,
it was impossible to verify the
charge.

A tipster on the twenty-seventh
ﬂoor, whose information has been
unimpeachable in the past, would
only comment, “On to Moscow!”

Assistant coach Nick Kliskey,
who wasn’t asked but couldn’t be
stifled, stated; “Maybe the Dies
committee will ﬁll one of the open
dates on Pitt’s 1940 schedu1e—who
knows?” V

Spring Grid Drills
Carded in March

Spring football * practice will
probably get under way‘ about the
middle of March, according to ath-
letic publicity director Frank Car-
ver. , Workouts will begin as soon
as -weather permits-

Another factor which confuses
the football situation is the early
spring vacation this semester. Two
recesses one for Easter and one for
spring recess, both come within a
week of each other and complicate
coach Charley Bowser’s task still
further.

Bowser is hoping that the weather
conditions will allow practice to
begin before the latter part of
March, since warm weather toward
the end of April would slow up the
Panther gridmen.

‘You’ve often heard the old adage: “Let a man make- _
a better qmousetrap, and the world will make, a
beaten path to his door.” ,  

But have you ever happened upon that path, or
even looked for it? 2

\Vhy should you, when the people who today have
things to sell beat a path to your door to tell you
about them? 

Every newspaper that comes into your home».,:; 
brings you a new list of -what you can get, and .1
Where. You can do your shopping in the advertis-
ing pages——instead of beating a path from store to
store to ﬁnd what you want.

Make it a habit to look over the advertisements,
and you’ll ﬁnd many ﬁne values you might have
missed . . . many exciting and useful things you
otherwise might never have known about!

National Poll Reveals
81 Per Cent Against
Compulsory Training

By Student Opinion Surveys of
America

AUSTIN, TEX, February 25.
-—"While the youth of Europe
marches off to the battle fronts,
American college students stand
overwhelmingly opposed even to
the mention of compulsory mili-
tary service in the United States.

This is revealed in a coast—to-
coast poll conducted by the Student
Opinion Surveys of America, results
of which show that 81 per cent of
the men and women attending the
nation’s colleges and universities are
against requiring “every able-
bod.ied American boy 20 years old
to go into the Army or Navy for
one year.”

"The polliwas taken using a sci-
entiﬁc cross section that includes
exact proportions of the different
types of students registered in all
the institutions of higher learning.
College men, who would have to
carry the guns and do the march-
ing, were found to be the most op-
posed, only 17 per cent favoring.
But 21 per cent of the half million
girls going to college said they fav-
ored military training—-for the boys.

The national results follow:

Men Women Both

Should require.17% 21% 19%

Should not re- :

quire . . . . . . . .83 79 81

These ﬁgures contrast with those
of a recent poll taken by the Sur-
veys, in which 87 per cent of the
collegians declared themselves for
ROTC training on the campus, 4
per cent more ‘men than women giv-
ing their approval. Of those ap-
proving, however, 58 per cent speci-
ﬁed that it should be voluntary.

The attitude of campus youth on
Army and Navy service is congruent
with that of the American public,
for in other national polls‘ opinion
has been registered emphatically
against initiating this practice now
so prevalent abroad.

A New Tenant

Post Oﬂice Moves
To Cathedral Rooms

The University post office, for-
merly located in State Hall, opened
its new headquarters in the Cathe-
dral today.

The post oﬁice, open from 8:30 to
5:30 o’clock during the school week,
may be used by the students and
will also continue to handle mail
for all the University buildings.

First class ma.il is handled in 167
Cathedral, just inside the Belleﬁeld
entrance. Second class mail and
parcel post is sorted in the receiving
department located in the basement
beneath Lilly Court on the Forbes
street side of the Cathedral. The
stock room is beside the receiving
department.

The rooms have been set up only
temporarily.

Approximately 75 per cent of the
UniVersity’s entire mail is received
by the Cathedral, says Raymond L.
Coss, superintendent of the depart-
ment of buildings and grounds, and
by so locating the post oﬁice, re-
handling of three-fourths of the
mail is eliminated.
