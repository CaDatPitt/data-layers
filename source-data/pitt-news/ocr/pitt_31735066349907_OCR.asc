 

. ‘ salaries for

.;_;.

by BILL GORMLEY
Editor

The Student Association Com-
missioners, who have fought for
themselves since
April, leapt over a hurdle Thurs-
day, only to encounter a more for-
midable roadblock Monday.

Salaries for the Commissioners

 were okayed Thursday by the Stu-
. dent Affairs Advisory Committee

A
i

O

(SAAC) and Chancellor Wesley
Posvar, but it was revealed Mon-
day that such salaries may be il-
legal under President Nixon’s
wage-price freeze. .-

Asked whether the SAAC‘s ac-
-tion was permissible, Dr. Otto
Nelson, a member of an Office of

;._ Emergency Preparedness (OEP)

committee, replied, “I don’t think
you can do this until the wage-
price freeze expires.”

Emphasizing that his statement
was an unofficial opinion, Nelson
said he would secure an informal
ruling on the decision from the
OEP during the next two weeks.
However. he said the OEP has al-

  The P

ready considered similar cases
and ruled against the new pay-
ment of salaries.

The announcement came as a
blow to the Commissioners, who
felt that their struggle for com-
pensation had finally come to an
end Thursday.

At the Thursday meeting, the
SAAC designated itself the arbi-
trating body in a salary dispute
that has raged for five months.
Noting the "failure of the Student
Association constitution to pro-
vide a legitimate process of re’-
view," SAAC termed itself “as
legitimate and fully representa-
tive a body of student leaders as
exists at the University." and pro-
ceeded to discuss the salary issue.’

\ By a vote of 6-5, SAAC rejected
a proposal by Committees Com-
missioner Wade Lawson and
Programs Commissioner Dennis
Concilla to award three out of four
Commissioners $120 per month
from September through January
plus $300 per Commissioner for
summertime living expenses ret-

roactively. The Commissioners
were eligible over the summer
for tuition rebates.

SAAC then voted 8-3 to award

I three out of four Commissioners

$100 per month from September
through January and no retroac-
tive living expense money. Aca-

' — demic Commissioner Ted Micha-

lik has voluntarily waived all
salary claims because he has not
fulfilled his functions as Aca-
demic Commissioner-.

At the Monday meeting, Chan-
cellor Posvar brought looks of
chagrin to the commissioners’
faces when he revealed that Mike
Haley, representing Pitt Young
Republicans, had vowed to file a

 complaint with the OEP if the Uni-
; versity approved salaries for the
j Commissioners. .

Posvar then indicated the Uni-
versity would ask the OEP for
guidance, instead of waiting for
such a complaint to be lodged.

According to Dr. Nelson, the
salary decision will fare poorly
before the OEP. “If there has not
been a salary payment in the

 siASo1a1-res Encounter Roadblock

past," Nelson said, “it cannot be i

instituted during the wage-price
freeze.”

Commissioner Lawson told Nel-
son that the Social Commission
voted to award salaries to the
Commissioners before Nixon’s
Aug. 15 wage-price freeze an-
nouncement. Nelson insisted that
made no difference.

According to Mike Haley, a lo-
cal OEP representative confirmed

Nelson’s prediction. “It looks like’  ' 

an open and shut case,” said Hal-
ey, who strongly opposes salaries
for the Commissioners. ’

The Commissioners attempted

to secure salaries during the

spring and summer terms, but

were told the administration 

would refuse to sign salary dis-'
- bursements. Dan McFadden, Exe-

c_utive Assistant to the Vice Chan-
cellor for Student Affairs, and

. Bill Markus, Director of Student

Activities, reportedly told the
Commissioners the University

might be sued if it authorized.

tion salaries.

Counselors Doubt ,

Draft Law Impact

by STEVE LUBETSKY

High school guidance counselors
and administrators doubt that the
new draft law, which has abolish-
ed student deferments for newly-
enrolled freshmen will have any
profound impact on matriculation,
a Pitt News survey indicates.

Charles S. Goetz, counselor at
St. Anselm. asserted that male
seniors whose 19th birthdays are
more than a year away still have
time to plan their future. “Those
who will turn 19 earlier are the
ones most doubtful," he said.
Many students who will be affect-
ed sooner might go to community
colleges where it‘s cheaper and
wait for their lottery numbers till
they decide what to do.

Leslie Scammon, Jr.. college
counselor at Shadyside Academy.
a college preparatory school.
doesn't believe that the new law
will affect the college-bound in-
tentions of students there. “One
hundred per cent of all our sen-
iors apply to and attend colleges.

Most of them are 17, so they don‘t'

have to worry until the_v‘re in col-
lege."

Several counselors questioned
were unaware that the law had
been passed. William A. Bocic-
chio of Schenlev High School ad-
mitted that he wasn‘t informed
and that "probably many stu-
dents don‘t know about ‘it (the
draft law) either and still con-
template deferments.

“It won't prevent our seniors
from applyirrg to colleges fbecause
mostvof them won't be 19 for an-

Ms. Miriam Beckman of Pea
body doesn’t foresee any declin
in college attendance. “Peopl
will continue to take that chance,’
she maintained. And at Allder
dice, Ms. Ruth G. Conwisher re
ports that as many students a
ever are filling out applications.

John F. Drill of Fifth Avenu
commented that “not many stu
dents at Fifth who attend colleg
go to avoid being drafted,” bu
rather “for personal better
ment.“ Consequently,

and though many have the fi

nances to go to college. they will 
be grabbed by the draft following g

graduation."

The new law, Drill said. is "a 5
disadvantage to the student who 
has to interrupt his education and}
may not pick up later where he 

left off."

Ms. John Young of Gladstone;

“would like to see student defer

merits,” but admitted that “they 
have been abused so much, the§
change might be necessary. Many ,
people are going to college just_to §
evade the draft,” she said, “and 

they take the place of others wh
really want to learn.”

Kenneth Wenger. Dean of Ad
missions and Student Aid, said
that "the new draft law will no
affect incoming freshmen who ar

year.

v New DraftStati1s Revises

Appeals Process, Deferments

This is the concluding article in a _

series on military alternatives,

by STEVE ZYCH l
and SONDRA FRISBEE

Draft counselors Ralph Hago-

pian of the University and City
Ministries and David Morrison of
the Friends Peace Center outlined

the changes in the Selective Serv- ‘

iceoSystem as a result of the re-
cent draft act. They~pointed out
that there are four main proced-
ural changes and several substan-
tive changes.

The first procedural change
means that a registrant may per-
sonally appear before his local
appeal board. Secondly, the regis-
trant has a right to have witnesses
appear on his behalf, "subject to
reasonable limit." at the local
board hearing. Thirdly, there
must be ‘a quorum of local board
members present at personal ap-
pearances.

Morrison pointed out that this
will eliminate one man decisions.

Finally, if a local board or the
appeal board denies a registrant's
claim, it must state its reasons
in writing, “if the man (regis-
trant) so requests.” Previously
Federal Courts required the rea-
son(s) regardlessof a request in
conscientious objector cases, and
Morrison said the final provision
“may be a setback for C0’s who
didn’t have to request a reason
according to the 1967 Act.”

Among the several substantive
changes is that the President. un-
der the new.act. has the discre-
tionary authority to grant defer-
ments to undergraduates and
graduates.

  

V

  

However,__ both. «men ‘

  

felt that Nixon would not. The bill
provides specifically that men
"enrolled full-time in college dur-
ing the 1970-71 regular academic
school year“ shall be allowed II-S
deferments till graduation, so
long as they continue to qualify
under II-S rules. Incoming fresh-
men, however, will not be defer-
red under the present act.

Other changes includethe fol-
lowing: ‘

I-S (c) The act abolished I-S (C)
classifications, previously avail-
able to undergraduates and a few
graduate students. Morrison said
this change was significant be-

cause previously a! man who held '

_ a I-S which had expired could re-
apply f'or a II-S, whereas now he
won’t be able to do so.

II-D Divinity students will now
be def'erred instead of exempt,

- ,B,u‘c's.

  

provided they maintain their cler-
ical vocation till at least age 35.’
A set classification for these peo-,
ple has not been named yet but it
will probably be II-D. ‘

(I-S (H) The new ‘act abolishes
deferments for high school stu-
dents; instead their induction will
be postponed. Morrison said this
was significant because it will
mean that they have no adminis-
trative appeal rights once they
graduate.

III-A—There are no official
changes regarding this (hardship
or dependency) classification but
an increase in government allot-
ments will make it harder to get

a III-A deferment for a ,border--‘- ' .

line case. Hagopian pointed out
that this classification is the hard-
est to get.

The University Health Center is
once again attempting to discover
1 the identity of “Medical Annie."

 Dorm residents, for the most
. part female, have been reporting
A calls from “Medical Annie” for
‘L at least three years. As yet, how-
 ever, the University has been un-
- able to locate her.

Claiming to be a Health Center

, staff employee, “Medical Annie”

calls students and elicits medi-
cal histories from them.

Draft
(Continued from Page 1)

IV-A (sole surviving son)—Ac-
cording to the act no longer must
-the registrant be the sole sur-
viving son of a father who died as
a result of injuries susta_ined in
the armed forces after 1959. Thus
any registrant whose father,
brother or sister died, or is miss-
ing in action in the armed forces
since 1959 is now given defer-
ment.

I-0 (conscientious objector) —
No change here except that civil-
ian work assignments for those
doing alternative service are now
under the Federal Selective sys-
tem rather than under the juris-
diction of the local boards.

I-Y and IV-F—The changes for
those with physical or emotional
handicaps here are too numerous
and detailed to list here. Anyone
wanting to know more about this
should Contact any draft counselor

‘and ask to see form AR 40-501
which is a long list of all the stan-
dard for disqualification. Hago-’

~pian said that the reason for dis-
qualification doesn't have to be
physical but can also be emotional
or psychological in nature.

Students who have spoken with
“Medical Annie” report that her
approach is specific and direct,
and her professional manner
readily convinces many students
of her alleged medical position.

No one knows how “Medical
Annie" obtains the names and
phone numbers of the dormitory
students. She most often asks for
a specific student, knowing the
person's room number in addition
to the phone extension.

A number of University em-
ployees who are working on the
problem share the opinion that
"Medical Annie” may have a more
complete listing of dormitory stu-
dents than the Housing Office.

Ms. Beverley Cantwell, super-
visor of the Health Center nurs-

ing staff, urges students who re- .

ceive a call from “Medical
Annie” to refuse to divulge any
information and to hang up on the
caller.

Students are asked to call the
University Health Center (ext. "518
or 519) and report such calls im-
mediately. Attempts will then be
made to trace the phone call.

At Lantern Night

Iirosh Women Inducted 

 

by LINDA SAVAGE

Breaking with tradition. Lan-
tern Night this year did not mark
the end of curfews for fresh-
women as it has in the past. All
women have been on a self-regu-
latory no curfew system since
the beginning of the term.

Previously women under 21 had
to observe a 12:30 a.m. curfew
on weekends until Lantern Night.
After Lantern Night those fresh-
women who had received the ne-
cessary parental permission
could regulate their own hours.

Also for the first time, fresh-
man women were not required to
wear a white dress. \

This was the 15th year fresh-
man women were formally induct-
ed in a ceremony sponsored by
the Associated Women Students
and the Alumni Association of the
University.

The ceremony entitled "The
Gift of. Light” was in the Stephen
Foster Memorial and the Com-
mons Room of the Cathedral, Sun-
day evening. As the women were
ushered into the Stephen Foster

Memorial, Claudette Paskavitch
played Chopin on the piano. Terri
Weaver, chairman of the Lan-
tern. Night Committee, gave the
welcoming address and intro-
duced Robert Leap as Father Pitt
and Helen Roe Sawyer as the
Alumnae representative. 1

After receiving their lanterns
the women were led through-an
underground tunnel and into the
darkened Commons Room of the
Cathedral, illuminated only by
the candles of upper class wom-
en and a torch burn at the front.

The program consisted of
speeches on the topics of truth and
valor given by Judy Kichi and Kar-
en Collins. Father Pitt spoke on the
history of Lantern Night, and the
alumnae representative com-
mented on what this event should
mean to each woman.

As the lanterns were lit the Pitt
Glee Club and Women‘s Choral
sang a selection, then everyone
joined in the Alma Mater. Weav-

 

ing in a serpentine with their lan-
terns lit the women, now formally
inducted, left the Cathedral.

Each girl received her lantern
as a gift from the Alumane of the
University.

 

LANTERN Night: Protecting Virtue.

Students Elect English Composition Courses

by DEBRA DUNCAN

A long held argument against
abolishing course requirements
has been that students won't take
what isn’t required. Therefore,
theargument goes, the standard
of education acquired goes down
as a result of giving students the
opportunity to" make their own
choices.

In practice, however, it seems
that there is the chance both sides
may be satisfied that require-
ments can be abolished and stu-
dents given the decision to take
what courses they wish and that
the college can still maintain a
high standard of education.

Such a development appears to
have occurred with the English

composition requirement. Last.
year the requirement of English

1 and 2 for students in the Col-

lege of Arts and Sciences was

abolished. That left it up to the

student to decide whether or not

English composition was an in-

tegral part of his education.

The result has been rewarding
to those in favor of liberalizing
trends: 80 to 90 per cent of all
freshmen enrolled in the College
have requested the new composi-
tion program being offered by the
English department as a replace-
ment for‘English 1 and 2. Alto-
gether 750 students are presently
enrolled and 400 freshmen had to
defer the courses they desired un-
til a later term.

“Do you know where you’re go-
ing?" This question will again be
painted on sidewalks all over the
Pitt campus as the famous yellow
footprints lead students to‘ the
Student Union Ballroom for the
Fourth Annual Career Seminars,
Oct. 4-8.

The Career Seminars are a se-
ries of programs in which men
and women in many different ca-
reers meet with students in small,
informal discussion groups to in-
form students about career oppor-
tunities, educational require-
ments, and working conditions
in fields ranging from television
broadcasting to metallurgical re-_
search. The' seminars are spon-

iﬂesored by the University Counsel-

ing Center and will be held in the
afternoons from 1 to 4 p.m. '

The first day of the series will
be devoted to Government, Law,
Public, Urban and International Af-
fairs. Exemplars for this day in-
clude Robert Paternoster, City
Planning Director, and Jane
Thompson of the Citizenship Infor-
mation Center.

Representatives from Pitt’s
Graduate School of Public, Urban

4 and International Affairs will be

there to discuss’ graduate educa-
tion and career opportunities in
this field. Harris Miller and Bill
Gormley whohave worked as sum-
mer congressional aides for Pitts-

 burgh Representative William

stations before joining WTAE-
TV as a reporter, will share her
experiences in the broadcasting
business. Merle Pollis, WJAS
“Communi<;aster,” and people
from the Pittsburgh Press, Post-

Gazette and Forum will round out
the exemplar list.

The Health Professions and Re-
lated Areas will be spotlighted on
Wednesday, Oct. 6. Mary Ann Sci-
alabba, Associate Dean of the
School of Health Related Profes-
sions, will be available to answer
questions. Medical technology,
physical therapy, inhalation ther-
apy, nurshing, medicine, dentis-
try, psychiatry and other health-
related fields such as nutrition

' and hospital administration will
also be represented.

ACTIVITIES FAIR: Very qui

A fair is usally a place where
there is plenty of activity, noise,
and people milling about. The Ac-
tivities Fair, held on Monday and
Tuesday of this week, was far
from your ordinary, everyday fair‘.

The Student Union Ballroom,

site of the fair, contained little
of the carnival atmosphere that
typifies most fairs. It was very
‘quiet with only a few students
venturing in to see if they could
find a place in one of Pitt’s many
activities. _

One of the students sitting at the
Oratory’s table stated that “The
Activities Fair is baloney. The
management and publicity is poor

est in ‘her activity hadbeen fairly
strong. “Most of those interested
were freshmen and sophomores,”

. Trunzo said. “They’re concerned

not only with helping themselves,
but they seem to have a great de-
sire to get involved.”

The group that appeared to have
gotten the greatest response was
the YMCA. The person at their
table stated that the Activities
Fair’ is a good idea because fresh-
men want to get involved. He also
said that the small number of peo-
ple attending the fair was due to
lack of publicity and the small
number of organizations repre-
sented.

Another organization that re-
ceived sizable support. was the
Pitt Ski Club. The club's table was

located in the farthest, darkest
corner of the Ballroom, but this

didn't seem to stop the 30 or so ,
skiers who signed up for the or- ' 
ganization. Brian Chambers, pres- _ _ "

ident of the club, said that most
of those signing up were fresh-
men and sophomores. ’

The group that appeared to have
generated the least interest dur-

ing the Fair was_the Pitt News. Sue »— I I

Hoenstine of the News said that

the only thing she had had to do all ‘-

afternoon was blow smoke rings

and that even thatwas thwarted.

by the draft in the Ballroom. When
asked how many people she talk-
ed to, she stated, rather down-
heartedly, “One. And I had to trip
him as he went past the table."

Nixon .Wounds   Workers

by PAUL Le BLANC

' While both the Republican and Democratic Parties seem to
have thrown their support behind the Nixon “wage-price freeze“
-‘policy, there has - predictably- been a sharply critical reaction
rom the labor movement. Does this arise merely from narrow
Tiself-interest - or are there solid criticisms to be made? What
 re labor’s arguments? 
~ 4 ..One argument is that, because prices have risen 23 percent
“between 1965 and 1970, the real wages of American workers have
lready been “frozen” for some time. Here are the average weekly
arnings of manufacturing workers as shown in the July 1971
’,-Monthly Labor Review, published by the Bureau of Labor Statis-
,’-“trics: 1965 - $102.41; 1966 - $102.31; 1967 - $101.26; 1968 - $102.45;
1:969 - 101.49; 1970 - $99.66 (May) 1971 - $101.81. The wage-price
reeze, continues this argument, is grossly inequitable and will have
the effect of driving wages down.

gerald, President of the United Electrical Workers:.“While no ma-

'lfc~hinery has been provided for the enforcement of a freeze on

V? prices, there already exists a gigantic organization ready and
eager to enforce the wage freeze. The entire corporate structure

of the nation has’been immediately mobilized to this end." The

-“second reason has been suggested by the executive council of the
International Association of Machinists:

.A  . “The President's wage freeze does not extend to profits, bonus-
..es, stock options or other forms of executive compensation. More-
/,_..over, he has made no attempt to freeze or reduce the current high
rates of interest that are eating away at the incomes of working
~ people. The President’s freeze on prices does not extend to unpro-
jcessed foods, even though the average American working family
.. spends 28 percent’ of its total take-home pay on food.”

- A recent “Open Letter to Trade Unionists on the Wage Freeze
{ and the War,” signed by over 160 labor officials, sees the wage
freeze as “an attempt to shift the burdenof the Vietnam war _more
‘-'.-directly on to the backs of working people.” Rising industrial pro-
ductivity should be enough to allow wage gains without causing in-
jflation. Yet labor has been unable to raise wages fast enough to keep
pace with the soaring cost of living. (In contract, corporate profits
have risen by 5.4 percent since 1965, exceeding the $82 billion
mark.in the second quarter of 1971, exceeding to the August 21
financial page of the New York Times.) The “Open Letter” asserts:

“Nixon claims high wages cause inflation. That is not true.
-The war is the major cause of inflation. To check inflation, we
=_-_must end the war in Vietnam - not feeeze wages. As long-as the
. _.war continues there will be inflation.”

. Splits have developed in the ranks of organized labor on the
_{,fwar-issue, with at least 64 percent of all union members favoring
6a total U. S. withdrawal from Vietnam - inopposition to the pro-
gwar stance of AFL-CIO head George Meany ‘(according to the
_; _“New York Post,” March 4, 1971. ‘

_ A A similar split seems to be quietly developing over how to re-
 _spond to the wage freeze. Although Meany originally thunder-
 ‘ed total opposition to the Nixon policy, he has more recently hint-
"ed at the possibility ofjlabor cooperation in exchange for a promin-
;¢_‘ent’ place for the labor bureaucracy on a “Wage-price review
or-board.” In contrast, the September 24 New York Times notes:
~“The attitude of union’members toward Nixon’s wage-price freeze,
{which was originally reported to be favorable, now appears to be
 generally antagonistic and often bitter.” '

_. In line with this growing rank-and-file bitterness, 16 unions

(including many which oppose the war, such as the Auto Workers
and~Amalgamated Meatcutters) issued a statement on September
15 vigorously denouncing “Nixon’s wage freeze and his new plan
-to continue the freeze in a different guise."

‘ The rift’ in labor’s ranks over’ Vietnam has widened dramatically
andshould be most‘ visible in the upcoming. anti-war action of Oc-
tober 13 and November 6. But this will seem like small potatoes if
a division on the wage freeze - accompanied by an upsurge of rank-
-and-file militancy --actually occurs. At this point it seems to depend
_g;~.."on-what Nixon has in ‘mind-for “phase two” of his new policy,
‘ff gaatgthe end of his 90-day “Freeze” period.
.~1_-_- ~What seems likely, on the basis of Nixon’s performance to
y‘;',..date, is: a policy of stiff wage controls; nominal price controls;
 \,};'._-.—no regulations of profits, dividends and interest rates; and large
_-, . tax. concessions to corporations along with token concessions to the

w’ average consumer. This could do much to stimulate the kind of
“f-“militant, socially conscious unionism that people thought had died
, with the 1930's. .
 “Instead of placing more controls and burdens on working peo-
 ple, why not push for greater control over foreign policy, military
 expenditures and corporate power by the blue ‘collar and white
 ' collar majoritv in this country‘? " '

by LOIS LEVINSON

What’s it like to be an ana-
chronism in your own time?

Cheerleaders, those bastions
of popular enthusiasm during
the 50’s and early 60‘s, are be-
ginning to find out. It seems
that it’s not “in" to cheer any-

more at Pitt.

I attended the Pitt-Oklahoma
game on Saturday with a nostal-
gic longing for the excitement
of past high school games. It
was the first Pitt game I attend-
ed. The college from which I
transferred, the largest private
university in the US, had elim-
inated football altogether.’ _

Prepared to subject my vocal
chords to strenuous activity, I
was disappointed to find them
sidelined for the entire game.

The eight female cheerlead-
ers pom-pommed onto the field
all golden. (And blue) They
were still .the same pretty,
bouncy petite girls who used
to spark the metabolism of all
athletes up to great heights.

They‘ put on their biggest
smiles, (one girl even managed
to smile while she vigorously
chewed her gum.) and went into
their very routine routine. Most
of them seemed disinterested and
self-conscious.

No contact was made with the
crowd which seemed a little
embarrassed for the girls as they
went through the stilted motions
of meaningless cheers or climbed
on the male cheerleaders’ shoul-
ders for a little added drama._g

When they broke formation

Democracy:

ruled the students. A few stu- .

dents voted for the “qualified

elite” who claimed to represent

us. But for the most part, this
undemocratic condition was at
worst bothersome to a few be-,

cause most students were obliv-

ious to the existence of SG.

Those were the good old days
when Student Government had
no power. But a new aristoc-
racy has usurped the throne of
the old SG and called it the SA
(Student Association).

But many people ignored this
turn of events because they felt
it was the old shell game with
a new name. The difference this
time was the new aristocrats, the
student commissioners, were arm-

-ed with a new constitution which

was vague and unrestricting.

This absence of law always
tends to allow those who govern
the chance to expand, and abuse,
their power over the governed.
And that’s exactly what the new
SA aristocrats have been doing.

_ They have made the new SG,
1.e. the SA, relatively powerful
and at our expense.

First, the commissioners made
the Allocations Committee into
a rubber stamp and increased
the students’ Activities Fee from

__$8 to $12 a term. They did this

others just stood there and shook
their heads at the way the game
was going . . . an encouraging
sight for those watching.

They certainly were not in-
spiring," but then they didn’t
have much to work with. The
spectators had such an air
of general disinterest that I be-
gan to wonder why, so many had
come. I guess there really isn’t
much to do in Pittsburgh on a
Saturday afternoon.‘

There were no banners wav-
ing. I asked one boy why he
didn’t buy a banner. “Now what
am I gonna do with a banner?
Now, if they was sellin’ ‘No
Parking’ signs. . 

A black fraternity sitting near-
by cheered themselves on by

taxation without representation.

Well, after that success, these
new and powerful aristocratic
commissioners got hungry and
demanded wages for themselves.
They already had money for
traveling expenses and other in-
cidental luxuries, plus the full-
time services of a paid secre-
tary.

Of course, that’s not enough
for aristocrats, especially new
and powefful ones. But I guess
they weren't omnipotent ‘enough,
because the University adminis-
tration said no this summer.

Now that’s all changed. First,
the Allocations Committee ' '
claimed early this fall that it
was no longer a rubber stamp.
A few concerned students claim-
ed we needed’ further constitu-
tional reform. And the com-
missioners from the mount re-
sponded yes.

Then suddenly it was rumor-
ed from the heavens that one
of the gods, the Chancellor,
thought the salaries were appro-
priate for the aristocratic com-
m1ss1oners.-

They got them, and now our
plutocratic commissioners will
be expropriatlng $100 a month
in salaries. Hip Hip Hooray!

making the Black Panther sal-
ute during the “Star Spangled
Banner” and by dancing to a
self-made cheer with rock over-
tones.

Perhaps the cheerleaders
could relate better if they tried
a little more rhythm and a little
less regimentation. If they’d
yelled “right on” the crowd
would have been right behind
them.

Wisps of smoke from a famil-

iar weed wafted through the air
and everyone sat nonchalantly
viewing the game as an after-
thought. '

I stood up and shouted along
with a male cheerleader who
had the microphone and every-

’ one stared as if I were crazy.

Someoneasked me if something
was the matter.

At a crucial point in the game
just _, before half-time, people

started standing up. They were-

shouting and cheering! I could-
n’t believe it and then I noticed

that they weren’t watching the~

game . .‘ . they were staring to-
wards the top of the stands.

I asked a girl what was going
on and it seems they were
cheering someone who was
threatening to jump. It was the
only instance of enthusiasm dur-
ing the whole game.

Since we are entering an era
where “my country (or my team)
right or wrong” no longer seems
valid to most college students,

“rah, rah, team.” doesn’t seem

so important. Cheerleaders seem _

to be a holdover from a past that
most of us would rather not con-
tinue.

End Aristocracy
by’ reforming the

SA constitution

Maybe we, the students,
should propose a little. consti-
reform by amending
the SA.constitution in the- fol-
lowing manner:

“No voluntary student or-
ganization using money collect-
ed from activities fees shall give
any of its members any form of
monetary compensation.”

With this “grass roots” effort,
we will abolish the. aristocracy
and the hew plutocracy that has
ruled us.‘~ And maybe we’ll get
a little democracy, too.

Youths Find Europeans Relaxed,

by BILL KACZYNSKI

Eleven scholarship recipients
studied abroad this summer
through the generosity of the Na-
tionality Rooms Committee. Some
worked independently and others
enrolled at a European university.

KAREN WOODALL
British Sincerity

Although they spent their sum-
mers in various European coun-
tries. the travelers returned with
many common observations. Pre-
dominant among these was a sur-
prise at both the relatively high
degree of political awareness
‘among Europeans and the relaxed
pace of European life.

The presence of United States

companies and the pervasiveness

of its domestic and foreign‘poli-
cies in European thought lessened
cultural shock in big European
cities- But with the onslaught of
American tourists in June, many
awardees_ tended to shy" away
from the centers of tourist attrac-
tion.

Realizing that American tour-
istin Europe may have been out of
their environment, many of the
students could not help but pic-
ture many of their fellow citizens
as being naive, perhaps even ego-
centric. They viewed most of the
Europeans whom they met. on

the other hand, as being very tol-' .

erant of others, and extremely
well-versed in world politics. This
was manifested by the extreme in-
terest with which the Europeans

questioned and discussed United

States policies and their quite
thorough knowledge‘ of both our
language and customs.

Barbara Branon, recipient of the _

Award for Norway, found she was
often forced to become an ambas-
sador. if not a nationalist, in re-
sponse to unfounded criticisms of
the U.S.

The job of ambassador also in-
chides pleasant tasks, as Amy
Karpinski, winner of the David L.
Lawrence Memorial Award, was
surprised to note. When it was
discovered by foreign friends that
she was an American she’ was

treated to a verse of “When the

Saints Come Marching In.”

Some of the awardees discov-
ered that our way of life differs
greatly from that of the Europe-
ans. Karenlwoodall, who studied
in the British Isles this summer.
considered the kindness of the
American to be less sincere than
that of her hosts. She reasoned
that "Americans are never taught
just to live. but are instead taught
to live for something." Conse-

quently, Americans tend to be less .

concerned with the present and

are busy looking toward the fu- _

l'.UI'€.

, Carl Van Horn, recipient of the
Scottish Room Scholarship. ech-
oed these sentiments, contrasting
the natural politeness of the Bri-
ton with the somewhat unnatural
and affected politeness A of ‘the
American. ~

Van Horn also emphasized the
importance of getting a true pic-
ture of Europe and its people. He
recommended individual study,
displaying skepticism toward dor-
mitories for American-sponsored
programs, which tend to “re in-
force older values, and impede
appreciation of newer ones.”

The importance of a knowledge
of the host country’s language was
also emphasized by the awardees.
Mike Saloman, graduate recipient
of the French Room _Scholarshi_p,
pointed to the difficulty of im-
mersing oneself in the socio—cul-
tural milieu without native fluen-
cy. For many, living with a Euro-

session.

Few of the Pitt scholars felt con-
spicious as Americans overseas,
and many acknowledge the uncan-
ny perceptiveness of the Euorpe-
ans, both in spotting foreigners,
and in announcing with certainty
what country these foreigners
were from. Mary Jane McMullen,
who studied in southern France
this summer, points out a dead
give-away: possession of Europe
on Five Dollars a Day. ~

The awardees returnef with ex-
panded perceptions and new ap-
preciation of their own country.
The technology was somewhat
missed by some, as was the vast-
ness and richness of nature here
in the United States. Some were
ready to return to the fast pace of
life here.

Janice Haupt, recipient of the
Italian Room Scholarship, attri-
buted the relaxed atmosphere of.
Italy to a single word. Whenever
something had to be done, the re-

_ ply was “patience, patience." A ,
greater amount of student free-

dom was felt by some to exist
here, while others expressed
gratitude to the country which

  
 
 
 
  
    
    
 

could afford to send them ab_roaii,.

house would have. been been wise
to invest in an orchestra for this
one. With only a piano, such tunes
as “You’re the Top" and “Blow
Gabriel, Blow" were shallow with-
out the added richness of the or-
chestrations that Porter created.

Jane Coleman as Rene Sweeny
was quite outstanding in both song
and deliver, but Bruce Detrick as
Billy Crocker was less than ex-
pected. His voice was not quite
what the music calls for, and his
acting a bit too “Robert Morse.”
However, he was more than suffi-
cient for the part—in fact delight-

_ ful without being “special.”

‘David Emge’s Whitney was a’
rich characterization, in fact bet-
ter than that. Dan Madia, a Play-
house student, in the role of the
Purser, delivered a consistent and
well-done performance. Earl Boen

Goes’

 

as Moonface was not quite the sin-
ister public enemy and lovable
personality that he should have
been at the same time, at least
much less sinister. The part seems
to call for more of a lovable, sin-
ister, James Cagney then he gave
it. Even then Boen revealed him-
self as a fine actor, though he
didn‘t quite hit the mark. Jennifer
Williams as Bonnie was for the
most part excellent in her por-
trayal; she dances nicely and
sings quite well. The remainder of
the cast made contributions in
fine style.

Director Richard F. Michaels
has given a lot of spirit to the pro-
duction, and ,. technically has
mounted a fine show. Unfortunate-
ly it‘ doesn't quite have the oomph
of the “Flamboyant musical of the

    

20‘s" that it was meant to be. Part A T

of this is due to the lack of an or-
chestra and another part to a less
than adequate chorus.

Although Paul Draper’s choreo-
graphy is quite fine, it suffered a
bit from the lack of talent to car-
ry it off. Len Feldman’s set is su-
perb. Costumes by‘ Frank Childs
are nicely done. Lighting by Pat
Simmons is atrocious. There was
so much shadow and ill use of in-
struments (especially those rov-
ing spot lights) that the obvious-
ness of the situation was embar-
rassing. Musical direction by

James Lawlor made the most of »

the score considering the limited
instruments on hand.

The Pittsburgh Playhouse pro-
duction of Anything Goes is not su-
perb yet; neither should it be neg-
lected. It is entertaining and quite
nicely arranged, but it just isn’t
excellence. Nevertheless, it is bet-
ter musical comedy than I’ve seen
in Pittsburgh in a long time. Catch
it if you can!

“Who Needs ‘Enemies?’

by RON LOZOWSKI
Feature Editor

Friends in need are friends in-
deed. and the film of the same

' title is indeed in need of a little

help.

Currently featured at the For-
um, Friends is a kind of Romeo
and Juliet gone Love Story, chroni-
cling the relationship between a
poor little rich boy (Sean Bury)
and an even littler orphan girl
(Anicee Alvina), 15 and 14 years
of age, respectively.

Originally enough, the boy‘s fa-

Ither displays a distinct lack of

sincere concern for his son. Paul,
and the orphan Michelle's onl_vliv-
ing relative, a cousin, is not ena-
mored of her, either. Meeting in a
Paris zoo, the two eventually zip

, off in a ripped-off convertible.
‘While cruising in the country,

Paul loses control of the wheel,
swerves off the road.and splashes
into‘ a pool of water, sending the
vehicle toga watery demise.

No sooner have the giggles sub-
sided when Paul recalls that the
character from whom he had ap-
propriated the auto happens to be
his father—and, well, you can take

 things from there. Let it suffice to

reveal that the friendship grad-

   Triends’ Needylndeed

ually matures into romance, with
Paul and Michelle planning to live
and love together “forever and
ever“ on their own in her father's
cottage. Or at least right up until
the closing swindle.

It appears that Bury and Alvina
are rather enhancing their,anony-
mity, frequently rendering at-
tempts that are visibly strained.
Though the fiIm'itself is not with-
out a few tender scenes, for the
most part such incidents are sim-
ply sticky cuteness bordering on
triteness, sometimes plummeting
off the edge. And the undisting-
uished photograph does little to
spark a friendly critical response.

Producer-director Lewis Gilbert,

also responsible for Alfie and You I

Only Live Twice, may find it diffi-
cult to shift the blame to the insip-
id script, for he also authored the
original story.

It doesn't require a burst of in-
sight to realize why the sound-
track recording was released well
in advance of the film, and proved
the most striking feature in early
ads for the picture. While the El-
ton J ohn-Bernie Taupin score is un-
doubtedably the most palatable
portion of the venture, the dis-
criminating listener is warned not

sorely disappointed faithful.

If you’re a real hard core Elton
John freak, your best bet is either
to (1) lounge in the back of the
theater, ‘shut your eyes tightly,
and listen, or (2) purchase the
record instead.

In the title track, Elton poses the
question, “Can you think of any
better way/For the lost and
weary travelers to go?" If you ask
me, forcing them to plunk down
their coins and swallow this con-
fection is not the best way and
would be a cruel trap.to spring

it. Take . Bernie Taupin’s “Don't

It is always an experience for
any listener to hear a program of
music with which he is completely
unfamiliar. Such an opportunity
was delightfully provided this past
week in a Heinz Chapel concert of
Renaissance and early Baroque
music.

William Mahrt. tenor. and De-
borah Minkin, lutanist. admirably

demonstrated their skills through *

the musical media of Renaissance
Italy and Elizabethan England.

Mahrt of the Eastman School of
Music acted as both tenor soloist
and harpsichordist while Ms. Min-
kin, a member of the faculty of
Case Western Reserve, fulfilled
the roles of both lutanist and vio-
list.

The music itself contained many
lilting and tuneful passages, hav-
ing the sort of rhythm one associ-
ates withla lively dance. Besides
these more sprightly works, there
were also works of a more dole-
ful nature represented especially
by the romantic laments of John
Dowland. Dowland, himself a
composer and lutanist of t.he,l6th

— century, was quite a good singer

  . Sprightly R-enaisstytce.
   usic Marks Cortdert 

and it is because of his songs thatfl
he is chiefly remembered. ' ‘ 

Ms. Minkin‘s delicate lute play-
ing and Mahrt's ‘vocal technique

did justice to the delicate balance .
of vocal and instrument art that in

Dowland's music demands.

Both musicians executed solo, I
performances in the course of the

concert as well. Mahrt's solo of-
fering was a wonderful partita
for harpsichord by Frescobaldi
while Ms. Minkin concluded the V

entire concert with a bit of Glori- ,._

ana by way of English songs for

"lute.

The fine acoustics of the chapel . I
the fine performances of -

and
these musicians made the entire

concert a most successful ven—_

ture. Due recognition also goes to

the University‘s music depart-‘

ment which sponsored the event.

More concerts such as this one I

are very definitely in order.

Angela Davis; Rally

Drrtws Slim Support

by SUE HOENSTINE

Attendance at the Angela Davis
Day rally indicated meager Pitts-
burgh support for the imprisoned
black leader.

During lunch hour Monday. 25-
30 white pickets distributed fly-
ers and carried placards bearing
Ms. Davis’ photo and words “end
racism and repression."

The demonstration was planned
as part of a national effort to
complete a petition with one mil-
lionsignatures asking bail for Ms.
Davis. She was imprisoned Octo-
ber 12, 1970, and charged with
providing weapons to Jon Jackson
who allegedly incited. a shootout
in the Marin County courtroom in
August of that year.

‘Jim Ferlo of the Young Work-
ers Liberation Front explained,
"She's a woman in jail, with no
trial, refused bail. Yet Calley is
free. This is the kind of inequity

we‘re talking about here—racism_

and anti-communism. "

One unidentified protester be-
moaned the low turnout. "It's a
shame; we should have gotten at
least 500,” he saidi

Ferlo commented that despite

Marc Cohen of the Pitt Chapter

Each college football team perennially plays a

is considered Pitt’s foremost foe. If this is true, then the annual
Panther-West Virginia game is something extra special.

When the Panthers and Mountaineers battle this Saturday,

. the memory of last year’s‘unbe1ievable Panther victory. Any-

one who witnessed the startling comeback by Pitt to win that
contest knows that the Mountaineerswill be seeking revenge

v this time around.

Apparently, the West Virginia fans and players have not
forgotten their second half disaster. People have told me that
bumper stickers and tee-shirts have .. I‘
been circulating around Morgantown
with “Remember Pitt” slogans. An-
other rumor has it that billboards
around town remind the citizenry of

“Last March, I noticed the WVU fans’ -
intense desire to get revenge for Pitt’s
36-35 win. When I traveled with the

 

hoop squads, several WVU -students
informed me that this year will be dif-

, ' HELLMAAN
ferent. They were already talking of revenge six months ahead
of time. _ V y T

For the third straight time at Mountaineer Stadium, the

game will be a sellout. Capacity at the_field (35,500) hasbeen
reached only eight times in WVU history, with Pitt accounting for

six of them.

At the beginning of the present season, Mountaineer head
coach Bobby Bowden stated that “this game should rate a toss-
up if played today. Pitt has the advantage of more veterans re-
turning, but we should have revenge on our minds and we are

’ also at home.”

Oklahoma’s Wishbone offense has ‘thankfully returned to
the Midwest, but the Mountaineers employ a similar attack,
though certainly not with the same success. In their first three
games, WVU has used the triple option. Only against Boston Col-
lege in their opener did they manage to roll up the kind of yard-
age reminiscent of the Sooners.’ speed machine. ‘

In the past two weeks, the "Mountaineer offense has sput-
tered. After amassing 45 points against BC, they produced only
10 at California and struggled for 16 tallies against Richmond on
Saturday night.

With the nightmare of the Oklahomatriple option behind
them and with a bit of experience in trying to stop it now, the
Pitt defense should be able to keep the Mountaineers contained
enough for the Panther offense to take control.

With only several‘ exceptions, the Panther offense has ac-
complished the job of movingthe ball in the two previous bat-
tles. Coach Carl D'ePasqua has? his own triple option for the quar-

terback slot——I-Iavern, Holgan and Medwid have all performed well.

Their lack of work on speed
doesn’t mean that the Banner-
men have spent most of Septem-
ber in idleness. Quite to the con-
trary, Cross Country seems to
imply endurance and Banner has

_ had them working on just that.

“I think most of the runners
are up around 100 running miles
a week now." stated Banner.

Banner had abandoned early
September meets last season in
favor of improvement in endur-
ance and injury preventing train-
ing, and has done so again this

95 Yds. Won’tlMake I

  Chatman   ating B

by MARK SIGMON

Pandemonium breaks loose in
Pitt’s Fitzgerald Field House as
the contestants for the 150 pound
bout are announced. The date is
February 27, 1972, and the Pan-
thers’ prize frosh matman, John
".Bimbo” Chatman, prepares to
do battle with his Penn State ad-
versary, Don Stone . . .

Saturday’s Pitt-Oklahoma de-
bacle was the scene of the Pan-
thers’ third-string fullback re-
turning a Sooner kickoff 76 yards
lugging the pigskin ten times for
95 yards, and constantly prevent-
ing All—American defensive end
Ray Hamilton from smothering
the Pitt quarterback. Yet, this
particular Panther played only
half of last Saturday’s game did
not carry the football even once
against UCLA.

Pitt's third-string fullback is
5‘7”, 175 pound John Chatman.

Most appraisals of Chatman’s
football agility and breakway
rushing ability emphasize his
wrestling experience as “Bim-
bo’s” prime source of gridiron

_prowess. However, Chatman

would prefer his critics separat-
ing the two sports. '

"Wrestling has helped my bal-
ance," explained “Bimbo.” "But
I just wish that writers would
stick to football right now and
wait till December if they want to
comment’ about my wrestling
style."

Nearly every one of John's ten
carries against Oklahoma came
over the right side of the Pitt of-
fensive line. Chatman lauded the
efforts of guard Rick Lozier and
tackle Ernie Webster.

“Rick and Ernie were really
blowing those defensive linemen
off the line. On that draw play in
the last quarter (with Chatman
scampering 42 yards), you could
have driven a truck through a hole '
that size.”

When pressed as to why he has
not seen more playing time and
greater utilization of his rushing
and receiving abilities, “Bimbo"

tition. .

Banner, who never looks on the
bleak side of any upcoming
meet, has again displayed a ray
of opitimism.

“I'm always expecting them to
win,“ he said, refering to his
Pitt squad.

Each team will be permitted
to enter twelve runners in the
six-mile race around the park
and the top five runners for
each squad will decide the scor-
ing.

A clean sweep is unpredicta-
ble but the Harriers have the
material to make one possible.

Dave Cheseborough, also a
Cleveland Heights grad, Mike
‘Collins, in his first collegiate
competition. Dave Szabat, and
Schurko along with sophomore
Rick Weaver, who has been hav-
ing fine workout performances
and a host of others give Ban-

  

“I hope to gain around 500
yards this season. and even more
important, have a high yard per
carry average. In fact. 20-25 at-
tempts per game would be great
bu.t 10-15 would satisfy me.

“Based ‘on my performance
against the Sooners, I think I will
see more action throughout the
rest of the year. Since I was pret-
ty fortunate to be gaining good
yardage in the second quarter, I
figured to play more than I did in
the second half, but I can’t say I
was disappointed.”

Chatman himself thought the
Panther offense performed ad-

mirably. On the other hand, “Bim-
bo".,had two small, but meaning-
ful, criticisms for the Pitt _ de-
fense. P . _

F or Boot Eligibility

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

Only under extenuating circum-
stances can a broken jaw be con-
sidered a stroke of luck.

For Gus Theophilos. Pitt soccer
lineman. a broken jaw was just
the bit of luck he needed to final-
ly break back into the booter line-
up for the '71 season.

Theophilos, in an appeal to the
Office of Student Affairs and the
Eligibility Committee, was final-
ly granted permission to return
as a member of the soccer team
on Thursday, Sept. 23, because
of additional extenuating circum-
stances.

These extenuating circum-
stances consisted of unusual
health-problems incurred by the
soccer player._During the winter
term of 1971 Theophilos wasill a
great deal of the time due to in-
adequate heating in his housing
facility and he also broke his jaw
in .the spring of that same year
around the time of‘ final examina-
tions.

Theophilos was originally consi-
dered ineligible to participate as
a member on the varsity booter
squad in a ruling handed down by

, the Senate Athletic Committee.

It is required by the Senate
Athletic Committee that, to play
in a varsity sport, an athlete must
have accumulated a certain num-
ber of credits and Theophilos fell
short of this standard.

SENIOR GUS THEOFILOS approaches the ball tactfully as he's done so
many times in the past for the Pitt boaters in an effort to add some strong
scoring punch to the squad’s offense. His goal in Saturday's game at West

Chester is an example of his value to the team.

Recently the Panther booter has
made the switch from the School
of ‘Engineering to the College of
Arts and Sciences and in the pro-
cess he has had to pick up addi-
tional credits to become eligible
to play in the fall.

Because of a misunderstanding
at the time the switch was made,
Theophilos acquired less credits

It was the first loss for the ‘71

Chester Rams, 3-2. Theophilos,
however. proved to be a" bright
spot in the Panther offense in that
he scored one of the two goals.

proved to be a lucky break.

, Panthers Administer

Third  Straiht Tst  

by JERRYWMYERS ’ 
Sports Editor

“This is the year that nobody seems to know
what kind of team they have. People have scor-
ed 80 points on us and they still don't know. We
seem to be the test case for everyone in the
country."

That's how Carl DePasqua greeted the report-
ers and members of the news media at the Pan-
thers third football luncheon of the year yester-
day. Pitt’s head coach was refering to the vague-
ness that has surrounded the grid potentialities of
schools that Pitt has played to date.

The ability of West Virginia, who meets the
Panthers in Morgantown this week-end, is another
issue that has been shrouded in mystery. By play-
ing both hot and cold in their first three games.
the Mountaineers have given scouts very little to
work with.

According to West Virginia’s new Sports In-
formation Director Dick Polen, “Seriously, we’re
not sure right now what kind of football team we
do have. We have a lot of talent, but so much of
it is inexperienced. We have sophomores running
all over the place.”

The fact that the Mountaineers only have six
regulars returning to their Starting line-up is evi- '
dence enough of their lack of experience. Offen-
sively WVAU has “sparkplug" Pete Wood back in
the line-up along with flanker Chris Potts and
tight end Nate Stephens.

Defensively the Mounties have‘ played "ex-

cepionally well so far,“ commented Polen,
"That‘s the biggest surprise this year.”

   

 

SENIOR Leon Jenkins (21,), one of WVU’s six return-
ing starters. .

Mountaineer Bob Bowden is aware of the emo-
tional overtones of this traditional rivalry.

O

“This is a big game for us,” Bowden said, “and
it’s practically half of our season. It doesn’t mat-
ter what the records are, or 'what each team’s
physical condition is, or anything else, it will be
a good football game.” *

Bowden won’t get any arguments there.

The rifle team will continue to function as a unit even though they _ i
have _not yet been informed whether financial aid will be forthcoming“
from the Allocations Committee.

According to Bruce Barrett. the team‘s captain; no one has con- i
tacted the riflers as yet concerning the funds they requested a few.
weeks ago. They've begun practicing though in anticipation of the up-' .
coming season. In Barrett's words. "We waited too long to start prac-
ticing as it was."

The riflemen have an exhibi-
tion meet this Friday against both
West Virginia and Indiana Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania. The match is
part of a three year contract
which is now in its third year. As
long as itwill be held at Pitt. the
team can manageto host it.

The squad’s seasonlopener is
against C-MU on Oct. 9. This is also
a home match. In addition to
C-MU the team will meet Du-
quense both home and away dur-
ing the month of October.

There has been a lot of inter-

squad and according to the cap-
tain,. “There have been a lot of
kids coming "out for the team —

BRBTHERHBBB,

  

Today, a few sentences on fashion.

You know, it’s crazy how fashions keep
changinor. Take shirts for instance: long
collared, knits, beery’s, turtles, wings
and zippers . . . or look at pants: dress
slacks, knits, jeans, button fly, cords,‘
brushed denim, and hip h.uggers.

  

We know that it’s difficult for you to keep
up with these changes, and it’s hard for
us, too. We try to merchandise basic,
current, and future fashion. We also try
to introduce new ideas, some of them
crazy," like sleeping bags and Howdy
Doody Shirts, some good ideas,- like
knickers and double zippered jeans, and
even some bad ideas, like some of our.
imported suits.

  

But even with all of these extreme trends,
we still feel an obligation to carry the
everyday jeans and cords, knits & shirts.
Our aim is to simply have a fashionable
store that will have what you want. It’s
hard but it’s the only way to have and

keep you as a customer. 4 A
