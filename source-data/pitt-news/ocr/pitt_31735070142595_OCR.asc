Classes not evacuated, Emergency Notiﬁcation Service not used amid police hunt for reported armed man

Drew Singer and Liz Navratil
' Pitt News Staff

As police searched for someone car-
rying a gun inside the Cathedral of
Learning yesterday, classes within
continued without interruption,
while students and professors re-
mained unaware of what was hap-
pening around them.

Shortly before 4 p.m., Pitt po-
lice ofﬁcers entered the Cathedral
after receiving a phone call alleging
that someone in a class had a gun
on him.

Pitt spokesman]ohn"Fedele said
that officers responded to Room 324,
where the man was said to be. But
the class ended at the same time that
the 911 call came in, so the room was

' already empty when the police ar-

rived.
The Cathedral was not evacu-

 resortesielg

Plﬂﬁﬁllﬁm

ated nor did Pitt send out an Emer-
gency Notiﬁcation Service alert,
which they have done in the past in

response to bomb threats made to
Pitt buildings.

“The threat is substantially dif-
ferent with a bomb,” Fedele said,
“because -it could affect the entire
building.”

Because the caller said that the
man did not have the weapon drawn,
the police did not consider the threat
serious enough to notify people in
the building. Also, there were no fac-

tors other than the original 911 call
to give oﬂicials a reason to issue an
alert, Fedele said.

Despite this, police searched the
buildingforthe white male described
by the caller, but did not ﬁnd anyone
matching the description.

“They’re taking this seriously,”
Fedele said.

CORRECTION: Yesterday’s story, “Fans remember glory days of Pirates, Mazeroski,” incorrectly stated the year of Mazeroski’s World Series—winning home run. Mazeroski
hit the homer in 1960. The Pirates also won the World Series in 1971 and 1979. Also, yesterday’s article, f‘EOTO electriﬁes stage with improv and dance,” incorrectly stated the
membership status of The String Cheese Incident. Jason Hann and Michael Travis are still members of the band. The Pitt News regrets these errors.

Being the best isn’t good enough for the city

Despite Pitt’s best public neighbor ranking, city wants Pitt to help fix funding problems

Michael Macagnone
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt was named the best public
neighbor college in the nation, but
city officials want the University
to contribute more to the commu-

, nity.

Pitt was named the top public
school in the country in the “Sav—
iors of Our Cities” survey published
earlier this month. At the same time,
the budget proposed by Mayor Luke

Ravenstahl contains a provision
that would charge the universities
in Pittsburgh $50 per student each
semester.

Pitt tied for second place overall
in the survey with the University of
Dayton. '

The survey, which was presented
by Evan Dobelle, president of West-
ﬁeld State College, took into account
10 criteria for each school’s contri-
butions to the community. These
included the amount of money that
went into the community, the com-

mitment of students and faculty to
community service and others.
Renny Clark, Pitt’s vice chancel-
lor for community initiatives, said
that Pitt’s ranking as the top public

university was a major blessing to y

the University. .

“To say that we’re thrilled is an
understatement,” Clark said.

He said that the ranking helped
to conﬁrm Pitt’s opinion that itwas
already paying enough to the city.

Michael Konig, who helped to
author the survey, said he and Do-

belle also looked for schools that
created a shared vision of the future

along with the community. Konig’

‘ said he was impressed by Pitt and its
involvement in the community.

Bill Peduto, city councilman for
District 8, which includes part of
Oakland, said that the city’s op-

‘ tions for revenue generation are
limited.

“Unless the mayor orthe univer-
sities offer an alternative, this may
pass,” Peduto said.

The city has “maxed out” the

when she saw about 10 police officers
patrolling the building.

“I really didn’t know what was go-
ing on,”. she said. “They really don’t
give you a lot of information.”

The police didn’t tell anyone in
the building what they were doing.
Kyle said she wished they would have
told people in the building about the
situation.

“I feel like you always imagine it’s
something worse,” she said.

A Pitt employee working in the
Cathedral, who could not give her
name because she isn’t authorized
to speak to the media, said that she
was happy with how the police re-
sponded. ' p

“Ithink I have conﬁdence in the
Pitt police to make the right judg-
ment,” she said. “Sometimes, dis-
ruption couldlbe much worse than
an event that wasn’t real.”

Pitt studentjoe Mccaffreywas do-
ing work in the Cathedral while po-
lice, unbeknownst to him, searched
the building for a man with a gun.

Upon hearing what happened,
Mccaffrey said he was “surprised,
maybe a little creeped out,” that he
didn’t know about the scene playing
out around him.

While he would’ve preferred to
have been told what was going on,
Mccaifrey said he wasn’t going to
leave the Cathedral because of it.

It is against the law to carry a gun
on Pitt’s campus, even if one has a
permit to carry a concealed weapon
elsewhere.

taxes it is allowed to levy, Peduto said. Pitts-
burgh has the fourth—highest property taxes
in Allegheny County,‘ the second—highest wage
taxes in Pennsylvania and the highest parking
tax in the country, he said.

The proposed student fee would go into
the general budget to help pay for running the
day-to—day operations of the city, in addition
to the Act 47 Recovery Plan.

The city’s current funding issue is an in-
dicator of a larger issue of the ability of mu-
nicipalities to raise revenue, Peduto said. A
long—term solution, he said, would have to

swer,” Peduto said. ,

Raising the taxes higher could force more
of the already shrinking population to leave,
he said. A A

“Pittsburgh will die. We don’t have a tax
base,” Peduto said. ‘

Clark acknowledged the difficulties faced
by the city, but said that Pitt would ﬁght to
keep its tax—exempt status. Pitt already pays
more than $4 million per year in taxes on its
non— educational facilities and in parking taxes
and amusement taxes and feels that it pays
enough, Clark said.

Pittsburgh will die. We don’t have a tax base.

bying Harrisburg for a change in the current

A fairer tax structure is needed, which
would give municipalities opportunities to
raise revenue lost because of the presence of
large nonproﬁt organizations, Peduto said.

At least 30 percent of the land in Pitts-
burgh is non-taxable, Peduto said. The loss

‘of revenue for the ‘city makes it difﬁcult to

fund necessary services such as wages for
city workers and infrastructure repair and
maintenance. _

“At this point, just saying ‘no’ is not an an-

“Trying to balance the city budget on
the backs of the nonproﬁt community is not
right,” Clark said. ' '

Konig said many municipalities have simi-

lar problems, which require collaboration and ‘

cooperation to solve.

“The idea is that they look to the universi-
ties to help support the community,” Konig
said. —

_Carnegie Mellon also made the top 25,
ranking 19th.

contribute to the community through its en-
gineering and music programs.

Use ENS for  
potential threats

Did you hear about the reported
man with a gun in the Cathedral
yesterday? Neither did we — at
least not through the Emergency
Notiﬁcation System.

That’s because the University
did not issue an ENS alert to stu-
dents, despite a 911 caller telling
police he saw a man with a gun in
the Cathedral.

Pitt police responded to the
call. They checked the Cathedral
and since-emptied room in which
the armed man had allegedly been
seen. However, they did not ﬁnd
anyone carrying a gun and did not
deem the situation a threat that
warranted evacuation or emer-
gency notiﬁcation alert (see story,
page 1).

The logic behind not evacuat-
ing the Cathedral is questionable,
at best. While an array of reasons
might exist, ofﬁcials offered two
chief explanations regarding why
they didn’t alert the students and
staff in the building. First, the gun
was not drawn, thus theoretically
decreasing its hazard. Wait, it gets
better.

Also, Pitt did not evacuate the
Cathedral like it would in the event
of a bomb threat because, “The
threat is substantially different
with a bomb because it could affect
the entire building,” according to
Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele.

We can assume that Fedele was
not referring to structural damage,
that his statement reﬂects concern
for all the students inside that
building. But then the question
is: How many lives need to be in

‘ danger before the University sends

out a text message?

Our answer: One.

A reportedly unknown, armed
man in the Cathedral potentially
threatens many students. Although
unconﬁrmed by police, this is not
something that the University
can withhold from students and
faculty. Such information is ex-
actly what the ENS was designed
to broadcast.

Most everyone has sat through
bomb scares — in high school or
college —— and thankfully these
situations are often false alarms.
But those experiences cannot de-
sensitize us from treating each
instance with equal concern.

We cannot be sure that, if a per-
son were armed and wandering the
Cathedral, he did not have some le-
gitimate explanation. However, we
can be sure that the police were not
aware of any such explanation, and
they felt enough need to respond
that they searched the building for
some time.

Something is inherently wrong
with the University and police
knowing about a potential threat
— however unlikely —— and choos-
ing not to inform students and
staff.

Even if officials determined that
the situation wasn’t a threat, the

worries and confusion instilled by '

the police presence —— combined
with the very slight but very real
possibility that someone actually
had a gun in the building —— should
compel those officials to notify and
advise the Pitt community to the
best of their ability.

It’ s not easy being green

Senators must compromise to pass climate—change legislation

Molly Green
Columnist

If there is one thing we can
learn from the ongoing health
care debate — besides just how
many Democrats it takes to kill
the public option (ﬁve!) — it’s
that moderate legislation is better
than no legislation.

We must keep this in mind as
we await the forthcoming debate
on the recently unveiled Senate
climate—change bill, which was
released by co—sponsors Sen.]ohn
Kerry, D—Mass., and Sen. Barbara
Boxer, D_-Calif., on Sept. 30.

The Boxer—Kerry bill aims to
cut greenhouse gases by 20 per-

cent (from 2005 levels) by 2020,
as compared to the less aggres-
sive House bill narrowly passed in
June, which calls for a 17-percent
emissions cut.

To accomplish this, the bill
proposes a nationwide cap—and-
trade system, which would place
an overall emissions cap on power
plants, industrial facilities and
reﬁneries, while allowing those
polluters to purchase emission al-
lowances should they not be able
to meet their limit reductions in

the allotted time. Because plants .

and facilities that surpass their
reduction goals would be allowed
to sell their surplus reductions,
such a bill would reward innova-
tion in developing new forms of

alternative energy use and create
new j obs in the areas of renewable
energy and efficiency.

In the past, cap—and-trade leg-
islation has been a cost-effective
and successful strategy in limiting
air pollution. Notable examples
include the Acid Rain Program
and the NOx Budget Trading
Program, which, according to
the Environmental Protection
Agency, lowered nitrogen oxide
levels by 62 percent compared to
2000 levels. The report said this
reduction helped reduce smog
levels by 10 to 14 percent.

The 821—page bill also offers
incentives for natural gas and
nuclear power use and promotion
of tree planting and sustainable

Vicious senate feud on bill coming soon

Both liberals and conservatives find fault with the proposed cap—cmd—tra'de system

Green 4 6

farming practices as alternative
compliance options for the indus-
try, according to The New York
Times. '

' While certainly not as effective
in cutting carbon emissions as
solar or wind power, the switch to
natural gas is a cheaper alterna-
tive —- and one that conservatives
would be more apt to agree to.
Not to mention, it is much pre-
ferred over coal. A 1995 study
by the Coalitionfor Gas—Based

nvironmental Solutions found
t‘ at smog and greenhouse emis-
sions could be reduced by 50 to
70 percent by switching to natu-
ral gas in electric generators and
industrial installations.

Despite the success of past
cap-and~trade programs, both
liberals and conservatives are
unhappy with an economy-wide
cap-and-trade system. Some lib-
erals view the bill as too lax on big
businesses, preferring an emis-

sions tax or simply an emissions
cap with no trade.

“While the language the Sen-
ate unveiled today contains some
improvements over the House
bill, it fails to commit the U.S. to
meaningful, science-based
greenhouse gas emissions
reductions needed to pro-
tect us from runaway cli— _
mate change,” Greenpeace
USA’s climate director, Da- ’
mon Moglen, told The New
York Times. “This propos-
al meets neither the needs
of science nor those of the
international community,
which is currently negoti-
ating the landmark climate
treaty.”

On the contrary, many
conservatives View the bill as
costly and too strict.

“The national energy tax was
a terrible idea when it passed the
House, and it is an even worse

idea now. Middle—class families
and small businesses struggling
to make ends meet shouldn’t be
punished with costly legislation
that will increase electricity

bills, raise gasoline prices and

Needless to say, when the leg-
islative hearings on the bill begin
Oct. 27, expect all the venom and
stubbornness of the health care

. debate. Expect ﬁlibusters. Expect

angry Tweets from Midwestern

And expect Old Leatherface Boehner,
even from the depths of his now-
irrelevant House lair, to rear his over-
tanned head yet again. - T

ship more American jobs over-
seas,” said Rep. John Boehner, R-
Ohio, who referred to the House
climate-change bill as “a pile of
sh*t.”

pect Kerry’s face to become even
more wrinkled. And expect Old
Leatherface Boehner, even from

For now, we ﬁnd ourselves in
that eerily calm period before a
political typhoon. Many senators
have not come out for or against
the Boxer—Kerry bill quite yet.
This. is largely because of some
smart planning on the part of
Boxer and Kerry, who purposely
omitted speciﬁc details as to how
the emissions cuts would be met
“leaving negotiations with Demo-
crats and Republican moderates
-to fill in the blanks,” according
to The New York Times.

It’s when those blanks begin to
be filled that we must remember
that compromise is key, espe-

Gallery to   transform   perception of wood

“Transformation 7 ”- features reinventions of common materials

Merritt Wuchina
For The Pitt News

“Transformation 7:
Contemporary Works in
Wood”
Various Artists
Society for Contemporary
Craft
2100 Smallman St.
412.261.7003

If you think contemporary

' crafts are just cute projects for

Girl Scouts and grandmas, think
again.

Artists featured in the Society
for Contemporary Crafts exhibit,
“Transformation 7: Contempo-
rary Works in Wood,” take the art
of crafting to a whole new level.

This crafted wood is not as

simple as the coat rack you made '

in your ninth-grade wood—shop
class. Instead, ‘these works of art
use ordinary supplies to expand
creative ideas and reinvent the
use of common materials.

“Most people think of wood as
restrictive, hard and difﬁcult to
work with, but a lot of the work in
the show expresses how ﬂuid the
wood can be,” Kati Fishbein, the
exhibition coordinator, said.

The exhibit begins Oct. 16 and

runs throughjan. 2.

“Transformation 7” features
24 artists from across the coun-
try and one from Pittsburgh, Ron
Layport.

“Transformation 7” is the so-
ciety’s seventh biannual exhibi-
tion. The title “Transformation”
reﬂects the beliefs of the society’s

« founder, Elizabeth R. Raphael.

“[Raphael], really believed in
the ability of artwork to change
lives, to change the way you think
about the world and to be trans-
formative. Materials can become
transformed into artwork and
artwork can transform people,”
Fishbein said.

The winner of the 2009 Eliza-
beth R. Raphael Founder’s Prize
will be announced at a public wine
reception Oct. 23.

Honorable mentions and merit
award recipients will be recog-
nized as well. The Raphael Prize
winner will receive $5,000 in cash
and a purchased award.

Some noteworthy pieces from
this exhibit include “Days of Sum-
mer by the Pond” by sculptor
Christian Burchard of Ashland,
Ore. The creamy-white, torso-
shaped wall sculpture is made
from madrone burl, a large out-
growth fromlthe root of a tree.

Katie Hundall, a sculptor from
Richmond, Va., experiments with
a more unusual construction in
her piece, “Symbiosis No. 1: Table
with Drawer.” Unlike Burchard’s

use of raw natural materials,
Hundall uses materials found
in Dumpsters and wood-shop
scrap bins. She does not leave
the wood unaltered. Instead, she

draws pieces of hardware on its
surface, making ﬂat surfaces ap-
pear functional.

Scarlett Johansson and Pete Yornfollow in Zooey DeChanel and M. Ward’s footsteps

' Kelsey Shea
Asst. A£rE Editor

  
 

Monday. It’s mocha morning for
me. I

While waiting in line for my
chocolaty indulgence this week at
Starbucks, my eyes fell on some-
thing, believe it or not, that looked
even better. — t

On the counterbetween a re-re-
re—released version of SergeantPep—
per’s Lonely Hearts Club Band were
the dark and sexy, yet manly, curls
and ever-effective pwhoa effect of
Pete Yom smiling at me from behind
some dark sunglasses.

Some mornings are just good.

But what actuallysurprised me
more than my indie-boy crush star-
ing me down at Starbucks was the
fact that Scarlett Johansson was
standing behind him on the cover
of their new collaborative album,
Breakup.

Equipped with a love for Pete and
the knowledge that]ohansson’s last
recording attempt (a Tom Waits cov-
er album produced by .Dave Sitek)
was feeble at best, I was genuinely
curious about what the two would
have to show for themselves.

In truth, despiteJohansson’s pre-
viously lame recording career, she
does have a cool and jazzy voice,
comparable to Zooey DeChanel,
another actress-tumed-singer.

Likejohansson, DeChanel found
herself aveteran indie singer—song-
writer to team up with for a collabo-

‘ ration album, in her case Portland

rocker M. Ward.

The DeChanel-Ward collabora-
tion, known as She & Him, put out
the critically acclaimed album Vol-
ume One last year and got such a
positive response that the two are
now working on Volume Two, which
is scheduled for release in 2010.

Clearly Hollywood sweethearts
and indie—rocker collaborations
have some potential for movie stars
and musicians trying to boost their
career, but could thejohansson and
Yorn pairing repeat the success of
She 8: Him?

One power walk down Forbes

Avenue later, I was streaming the
album’s single “Relator” from my
office computer and I had my an-
swer.

The clanky electro beat had me
tapping my toes, singing along and
immediately enamored with the
duo.

Though “Relator” is easily the
highlight of Breakup, the other eight
tracks of the album certainly don’t

, disappoint.

As it turns out,Johansson’s voice
is farbetter suited to Yom’s jaunty
electro—pop than itwas to the growl-
ing Tom Waits’ folk songs.

]ohansson’s smooth and jazzy
voice croons in harmony with Yorn’s
to create upbeat and fun duets as
well as slower songs, with a similar

Movie starlet-indie rocker combo a surefire success

‘style and mood of some of She 8:
Him’s material on Volume One.

Additionally, Breakup features
some of the best songwriting
fans have seen from Yom in a few
years.

Whether or not She & Him’s suc-
cess started a new collaboration
trend, as Scarlett Johansson and
Pete Yorn showed, the equation of
jazzy—voiced SOMETHING actress
+ indie songwriting dude proves to
yield a great collaboration album
and plenty of promotional media.

That’s not to say a Megan Fox and
Axel Rose collaboration would pro-
duce quite the- same results, but for
now collaborations between folky
and fun actresses and musicians
have my seal of approval.

illScarlett brings music

of sunshine state north  

Canadian band dabbles in So—Cal ‘beats

Bethie Girmai
For The Pitt News

illscarlett with Pepper

8 p.m.

Considering that illscarlett has the laid-

back Southern California style of Sublime,
it might surprise many fans that the band
is actually Canadian.
_ Alex Norman, lead vocalist and guitar-
ist, spoke to The Pitt News about what ﬁrst
attracted him to the music that he and his
band have now made a career out of.

“I would describe our music as a kind
of rock—reggae thing, like our own sort of
sound, pop-heavy‘ reggae, a little bit of
everything, but not too much countryor
techno,” Normansaid.

Norman said that most of the bands in
i1lScarlett’s genre are from the Southern
California or Hawaii. It’s rare for a band
like this to have Canadian roots when its
peers are so often singing about the sand
and surf lining the West Coast. ‘

“When all the So—Cal bands were popu-
lar, they came through the Warped Tour in
Canada. They were different from all the
screamo and sh*tty little hipster bands
that were popular then,” Norman said.
“We’re proud to play the music we want
to play, and that music opened our eyes
to the possibilities there.”

Norman acknowledged that setting his
group apart in a genre with such a distinct
style proved to be a challenge, but now illS-
carlett has come into its own as a band.

“Our music is not a very conscious act,”
Norman said. “We play what we like to
play even though we’re from Canada and
not part of the So—Cal scene. We have fun
with our music and see what we like, and
if we like it, we like it.”

Although the band formed as a hobby
when Norman and two of his bandmates
were in high school, it soon became their
life.

“We didn’t go to university or college
after high school, so we thought that we
might as well go for it, so it became more
of a job, but we still enjoy and love it.”

illscarlett originated in the band’s

hometown of Toronto, Ontario, about nine ~

years ago. Norman, Swavek Piorkowski
(drums) and John Doherty (bass, vocals)
met in high school. The band then met Will
Marr (guitar) through a mutual friend and
Anthony Carone (keyboard) throughthe

local music scene.

Norman has been playing the guitar ’
since he was about 14 years old. It wasn’t ‘

until he heard bands like Sublime, No
Doubt and 311 that he thought, “This is
wild, like nothing I had ever.heard be
fore.” . ’

Along with these bands, illScarlett
draws inspiration from anything and ev-
erything. .

“We all kind of write the music, usu-

ally we’ll ﬁgure out the parts musically,

and I’ll sing a melody over it with gargled
lyrics,” he said. “Once I get a melody, I’ll
begin to put thought behind the lyrics.
We’re inspired by everyday life, it’s usu-
ally accidental.” v

illscarlett has played with chart-top-
ping artists like Avril Lavigne, Bill Tal-
ent, Blink-182, The All—American Rejects
and Chester French over the course of its
career. .

Norman explained that although the
band managers’ handle logistics of col-
laborating acts, it’s the band that makes
the ﬁnal call. .

“We met Pepper about a year ago while
we were on tour with Flogging Molly in
Europe,” Norman said. “We kept in con-
tact with them and they eventually asked
us to join them on this tour. We had our
tour managers ﬁgure out the business as-
pect of it, but it was ultimately the band’s
decision.”

Green Day is on Norman’s list of bands
that he would love to play with. But Nor-
man emphasized that when it comes to
picking a band to tour with, it’s not about

the music, but rather the chemistry that’

the artists have.
_ “The most important thing about bands

on the road is who you are as people,” Nor- .

man said. “You do everything with them
for months, so you have to get along, and
Pepper has been very accommodating and
great to play with.”

Like their music, the inspiration for
the band’s name was unexpected. They
thought of the name en route to a bar with
intentions of dropping off their demo.

“We were on our way to drop off a re-
cording at a bar and realized we needed
a name. On the way we passed this neigh-
borhood called Sherwood Forest, whose
street names were modeled after char-
acters in Robin Hood. One of the streets
we passed was called Will Scarlett, so we
played on that.” ’

illscarlett will play with Pepper at Mr.
Smalls Theatre in Millvale at 8 p.m. on
Thursday.

Say what you want about OklahornaNpsych—
rockband The Flaming Lips, but give it this — it
almost always takes chances.

Following up on its pop-heavy, commer-
cially successful albums At War with the Mystics
(2006) and Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots
(2002), The Lips has retumed with its rawest,
leastaocessible record since Zaireeka (1997).

again,” frontman Coyne sings in the sinister
“See the Leaves.” Its songs are populated with
references to bats, worms and other unsightly
creatures.

Equally grim guest stars, including MGMT,
Karen 0 and even a German mathematician

— who mumbles equations over a subdued

“Gemini Syringes,” add a touch of ﬂavor and
character, but ultimately, this is unmistakably a
Lips album and that’s why it succeeds.

While its sounds and lyrics might be as

' insane and unhinged as another dimension,

they’re united by the same shared topics the
band has exhaustively explored since the late
’90s: mortality, science and rebirth.

Musically, this is a big departure for the Lips,
a new sound for a new decade. ’

But despite its Tagged, Unhinged approach,
its message — and its imagination —- remains
untarnished. Let’s hope the band keeps it that
way.

“Waive.” He ﬁrst produced a scaffolding-
like basiswith a computer numerical-
controlled machine and shaped the wood
around the form. The chair undulates at the
sides and curves laterally, exemplifying the
wood’s ﬂexibility. _

The art is judged by a board of two
experts in the ﬁeld, the exhibition direc-
tor, Kate Lydon, and Elizabeth R. Raphael’s
daughters, Catherine, Alexandra and Mar-
garet. A

The internationally renowned furniture
maker Craig Nutt is a member of the jury
and also has- his own collection of works,
“Cornography,” displayed at the society’s
“EAT: An Art Space About Food” ex-
hibit.

Fishbein said the caliber of competi-
tion is higher than in previous years and
so, “A prize—winning piece exempliﬁes the
meaning of transformation.”

In addition to offering guided tours, the
society gives patrons the opportunity to
evaluate some of the work for themselves
in a “Be the Jury” program.

Fishbein explains this program is de-
signed “for people who might not be ex-

it’s important and what makes it art.”

A tour guide pulls a piece by a previ-
ous winner from the society’s permanent
collection and explains to the group Why
the piece won and what aesthetic quali-
ties it employs. Based on what they learn,
the patrons go out and choose their own
prize—winners. '

Fishbein believes this is a Very eye-
opening experience for the patrons.

“Some people think, ‘Oh I could make
that; but when they learn about the con-
struction and how it’s actually made, it’s a
little more impressive,” she said.

The day after the reception, the society
will welcome the public to a dialogue with
the artists from noon to 2 p.m. A talk by the

winning artist will immediately follow.
The society’s studio also will offer a
sushi-plate workshop by woodworker Brian

Ferrell titled, “From Rough Wood to Raw”!

Fish,” on Oct. 18 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. After
an introduction to carving, the class will

ation.

In Pitt’s ﬁrst Big East game
against Louisville, Dickerson caught
a deﬂected pass in the end zone to tie
the game in the ﬁrst quarter, andwas
later on the end of a 37-yard strike to
take the lead in the second half.

Stull said that the chemistry he
and Dickerson have on the ﬁeld is
a product of their friendship and
familiarity off of it.

“I always say it helps to have him
in the room right next to me every
day,” Stull said. “We’ve been friends
for a very long time. We’ve always
had that type of connection. Now it’s
just getting the opportunity to [make
plays] on the ﬁeld. We’ve had a lot of
opportunities, and we’ve capitalized
on almost every opportunity.”

For Dickerson, who caught more
than half of Stull’s touchdown passes
this season, the work the two team-
mates did the entire offseason is an-
other factor in their success.

“Even in the offseason, we’d be
working together on the _field, so it’s
kind of natural to us now,” he said.
“It’s just nice to go out there and ac-
tually do it — make plays in a game
and in tough situations.”

This season, Stull and Dickerson’s
numbers are almost eye—popping.
Stull amassed 1,256 yards through
the air with a 66.7 completion per-

centage. More impressive are Stull’s
13 touchdown passes against three
interceptions ——— he ﬁnished last
season with nine touchdowns and
10 picks.

Dickerson has been one of Stull’s
favorite targets so far this season.

The scrutiny that Stull was under
coming into the season has been
well documented. A poor recep-

tion from a collection of home fans’

only focused the microscope more
acutely on the quarterback. ‘

Throughout the early-season
criticism of Stull, Dickerson always
believed in his roommate’s ability to
get the job done.

“I’ve always had conﬁdence in
Bill, he’s like one of my best friends,”
Dickerson said. “He’s doing a great
job. He’s come out and trusted in
his teammates and [relied] on his
friends. It’s just great to see him do-
ing well.”

Dickerson is no” stranger to criti-
cism either, as his college journey is
a bit stranger.

After being one of the nation’s
most highly recruited players com-
ing out of high school, Dickerson
struggled with injuries and bounced
around between running back and
wide receiver his ﬁrst season at
Pitt. .

As a sophomore, Dickerson was
moved to outside linebacker where
he failed to make an impact.

Finally, last season, Pitt moved
Dickerson to tight end. Yet, his
disappointing numbers — 174
yards and two touchdowns on 13
receptions — left some wonder-
ing whether he would ever ﬁilﬁll his
potential.

Now Dickerson, like Stull, is si-
lencing skeptics by putting up big
numbers and creating matchup
problems for opposing defensive
coordinators. Stull told reporters

that Dickerson’s athleticism makes
him a tough player to contain.
“Knowing the type of person
[Dickerson] is really helps me know
what to expect out of him and what
not to expect out of him,” Stull said.
“I don’t think you can ask him to do
anything that he can’t do physically,
just because he’s such a great athlete
 that’s why he can do anything and

everything.”

, Dickerson minimized his own A
performance in favor of the fate of

the team.

“It’s nice to catch touchdowns,
butas longaswe win, I’m good with
that,” Dickerson said after the Lou-
isville game. “'_I‘here’s nothing bet-

ter than winning. I want to go out a
champion.”

The Panthers took their second
step toward Dickerson’s champi-
onship aspirations by coming back
from a 15-point deﬁcit to beat a con-
ference opponent last Saturday.

Under new offensive coordinator
Frank Cignetti, Stull and Dickerson
are thriving during their senior sea-
sons. For head coach Dave Warmst-
edt, their progress has been both as
players and as people.

“[Stull] has been focused, he has
maintained that focus all year. He’s

_accomplished a lot. He’s grown up

a lot as__a football player, and, I be-
lieve, as a man,” Wannstedt said of

his quarterback.
The coach had similar praise for

Dickerson, who is ﬁnally getting an A

opportunity to spend a second con-
secutive season at one position.

“You talk about Bill Stull growing
up as a player and as a man, Dorin
has done the same thing. You’ve
got to give him credit,” Wannstedt
said. ' ‘ _

So far the roommate connec-
tion has been a productive one for
Wannstedt’s offense. If Stull and
Dickerson continue to link up on
the ﬁeld, the Pitt offense, which was
downplayed the entire offseason,
could prove to be the most explosive
in the conference.

r ""1 know this is Pittsburgh, so around

this time of year baseball isn’t ex-
actly in the forefront of sports fan’s
minds. But two days ago —— Tues-
day, Oct. 13 — was the 69th anni-
versary of what many consider the
greatest home run of all time: Bill
Mazeroski’s series-winning, walk-
off blast in Game Seven of the World
Series against the vaunted New York
Yankees at Forbes Field.

Every year on Oct. 13, a crowd

the city just might divert its sport
attention for a minute to America’s

are still actually playing baseball.

Yanks again and the Los Angeles

pating teams come from top 10 TV

sive numbers during the regular
season, leading the majors in runs,

get tighter, and it’s all about pitch-

rly season Q&A

   
 

Greg Triteley and Sergei Feldman
Staff Writer

A few games into the season, the defending
Stanley Cup champions have showed no signs
of slowing down. As the team sits atop the East-
em Conference, The Pitt News’ hockey experts
answer a few questions about the Penguins.

Through the ﬁrst two weeks of the sea-
son, how are the Penguins avoiding a Stan-
ley Cup hangover?

GregTrietley: By playinga solid road game.
Starting the season with ﬁve of their ﬁrst seven
games on the road could have ended badly, but
the Penguins have limited their mistakes in the
defensive zone. They are also scoring four or
ﬁve goals a night while away from home.

Sergei Feldman: If it hasn’t been a bal-
anced attack that has taken wind out of op-
ponents’ sails, it’s been timely goaltending.
Or opportunistic play. Or an overwhelming
hybrid of all three. If the Penguins continue
to play the way they have been through these
six games, we’ll be talking about this very is-
sue next season.

Should head coach Dan Bylsma move
Jordan Staal up to Evgeni Malkin’s line per-
manently?

V MC Campus

GT: No. Loading up the top lines leaves the

‘lower lines weak. It’s the same reason Bylsma

— and Michel Therrien before him ~ limited
playing Sidney Crosby and Malkin together. At
some point, the Malkin—Staal experiment will
stop working and Bylsma will go back to three

balanced lines. Plus, in the playoffs, opponents T

can line match against Malkin—Staal. Separat-
ing them creates havoc for defenses.

SF: Bumping Staal to Malkin’s line is an
undeniable upgrade to the second line. How-
ever, the third line, mostly anchored by Staal,
would take a signiﬁcant hit, considering the
team currently lacks centers. Remember that
Maxirne Talbot is out with a shoulder injury.
And while he spent time ﬂanking Malkin’s right
wing — albeit successfully — he has played
center for most of his career. Until Talbot is
cleared to play, which likely won’t happen until
at least late November, Staal should keep his
post as the team’s third threat down the mid-
dle, unless the offense needs a boost in-game.
When Talbot returns, Bylsma should consider
tinkering with the lines, if only because it’s
tooexpensive to pay $4 million annually for
a third-line center.

Should Scott Hartnell have been sus-

pended or ﬁned for biting Kris Letang’s
ﬁnger?

video doesn’t prove it, so let’s move on.

SE: The NHL’s explanation as to why Flyers’
Hartnell wasn’t ﬁned was that there wasn’t

sufﬁcient video evidence to suggest any biting

actually happened. Both the all—too—obvious
act by Hartnell and the league’s ruling are dis-
graceful. What the NHL has basically said was,
“Go ahead and bite away, just make sure there
are no cameras around.” What could they have
done‘? How about taking a look at the ﬁnger,
which clearly had bite marks on it, according
to various reports? Instead, the NHL sat on its
unbitten thumbs. -

‘ SF: Not only is the Penguins—Flyers rivalry
currently the best rivalry involving a Pitts-
burgh team, it may very well be one of the
better rivalries in professional sports. The
two teams have hated each other for decades.
For a considerable time, the Penguins couldn’t
win a game against the Flyers in Philadelphia.
More recently, the Penguins have turned the
tide, highlighted by going 8-0 against their

’ cross-state rival during the regular season
three years ago and dismissing them from
playoff contention the past two seasons. Before
the season began, pundits predicted the Flyers
would be the team to dethrone the Penguins
this year — especially after acquiring bruising
defenseman Chris Pronger.
