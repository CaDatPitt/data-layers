Kazim didn’t explore other options for
extracurricular activities on campus

“I would not do much, except for
my homework,” he said .“I would

To promote student involvement,
a campus—wide committee led by Stu-

Pitt stuns No. 1 UConn

by Zack Chakan
Adaiatant Sparta Editor

When their teammates struggled to
produce, Dejuan Blair and Sam Young
kept the Pitt basketball team ahead in

iMonday night’s masterpiece against

Connecticut, Pitt’s first win over a top-
ranked team in school history. _
But Levance Fields’ first six points
of the game were the most important.
The senior point guard didn’t score
until 3:11 remained on the clock and

the game tied at 61, but he connected
on two consecutive 3—pointers to seize‘
the lead for in the Panthers’ 76-
68 triumph over the No. 1 Huskies at
the XL Center in Hartford, Conn.
Before his huge shots, Fields

Pitt center DeJ1ian Blair bested UConn's Hasheem Thabeet with 22 points and 25 rebouids Monday night.

missed his ﬁrst seven attempts but de-
ferred to the efficient tandem of Blair
and Young

Young notched 25 points and
went 4 for 6 on 3-point attempts be-
fore fouling out late in the game, while
Blair’s 16th double-double of the
season resulted in a career day for the
sophomore center.

Blair dominated the  an-
ticipated rnatchup between him and

Connecticut 7-foot-3 star Hasheem t

Thabeet, scoring 22 points and pull-
ing down 23 rebounds in 38 minutes
for the No. 4 Panthers (24-2, 11-2 Big
East). i
Thabeet, meanwhile, was dogged
by foul trouble all game and ﬁnished

with just five points, four rebounds
andtwoblocks——hislowestinthat
category since Jan. 10 — in 23 min-
utes His rough output follows his
sterling performance in the'Huskies’
previous win over Seton Hall on Sat-
urday, where he totaled 25 points, 20
rebounds and nine blocks

Pitt’s victory was the first in prc»
gram history against a No. 1-ranked
team in 14 tries. It also snapped Con-
necticut’s 13—game win streak. The
Huskies last fell to Georgetown on
Dec. 29intheirﬁrstBigEastaffai1:

kies (24—2, 12-2 Big East) in the first
half, and ﬁnished with a team-high 18

Students are able to print a transcript of all

objectives by graduation will have the distinction
of  a green cord in commencement cer-
emonies The green cord is symbolic, because Pitt’s
colors, blue and gold, mix to make green, which
represents the uniﬁcation of the student body
to participate in common activities regardless of
major. However, Shawn Ahearn, director of com-
munications for Student Affairs and an OCC co-

connection to at least one of the nine goals

“If you can’t make that connection, it won’t be
approved,” said Materniak Students are also able
to backtrack events that they attended prior to the
OCC’s existence and receive credit

Committee member Shawn Brooks, associ-
ate dean of students and director of residence,
strongly encouraged students to go back and try
to complete the objectives, and he is especially en-
couraging freshmen '

“If students were to jump in the program at
the  of their academic career, by the time
they/re seniors they will have completed all objec-
tives,” said Brooks He noted seniorjames Osten-
dorf as “going above and beyon ” by  the
ﬁrst student to complete all the objectives Osten—
dorf backtracked all events he attended duting his
academic career at Pitt that related to the OCC ob-
jectives, ﬁlled out the  involvement sheets,
and is  toibe the ﬁrst student to graduate with
this distinction.

Student organizations are now able to apply
to have their events OCC—certiﬁed. Like students,
student organizations must ﬁll out a request form
and note how their event relates to one of the
nine goals If the student organizations event is
approved, the OCC will post it online with other
certiﬁed events Student organizations will beneﬁt

Although currentiy there is not a way to ac-
curately compare student involvement last school
year with this year, students themselves have no-
ticed an increase in their  involvement on
campus

Sophomore Ada Noh, a Student Government
Board member and Theta Phi Alpha sorority sis-
ter, noticed an increase in her participation in activi-
ties with which she might not have involved herself
without the OCC

“The OCC has exposedime to many 
that I normally would not have been exposed to,”
she said “For example, Academic Rush. I heard

aboutitthroughanemail frommyadviseraswell

asadvertisements ontheOCCWebsiteIamso
happy that I attended [the event] because so many

diﬁerent schools and majors were there It was nice
to be able to talk to all different departments about
my future, especiallybecause theywereallinthe
same area.’ ’

The main goal of the OCC 
Committee is to improve and prepare students for
their futulfes.

‘This whole program is [established] to help
students have an advantage in the job market and
when applying to grad schools,” said Aheam not-
ingthat studentswillbe able to msilyarticulate their
extracurricular activities

Pitt developed OCC to provide a more con-
crete approach to goals previously outiined in Pitt
Pathway, an online resource that provides Pitt stu-
dents with a proﬁle of certain atnibutes they should
embody by the time they graduate

Kathy Humphrey, vice provost and dean of
students, organized a team that included repre-
sentatives from every school at Pitt to resolve this
problem. The group brainstormed on how to
make Pitt Pathway more effective The result was
the OCC _

“Fromthatﬁrstmeeting,wewereab1etocome
up with 1,500 experiences for students to engage
in,” said Humphrey, who leads the OCC Coordi-

Despite the inﬂux of participation, students
shouldn’t expect any inﬂation in the student activity
fee because of the program, said Ahearn.

Marketing matetials have cost less than $10,000,
he said Card readers, paper for attendance sheets
and the green cords of distinction worn at gradu-
ation made up the majority of OCC’s

EDITORIAL  

Health care leaves itself

open to comparison

Tucked inside the $787 billion

9 economic stimulus package is an
I interesting provision that allo-
? cares about $1.1 billion to the fed-
} _eral government to compare the
_t effectiveness of different treat-
; ments for the same illness or con-
; dition. Government researchers
‘ would be able to use the money to
i compare drugs, medical devices,
3 surgery and other treatments, ac-

cording to The New York Times.

This allocation is the ﬁrst time

' that the federal government has
 directly
: medical research. While other
i countries have bodies that per-
' form the same sort of compari-
_: sons, the United States is relatively
 late getting into the game.

ﬁnanced comparative

Part of this is because of med-

: ical industry lobbyists, who, not
1 surprisingly, are opposed to this
 part of the stimulus package. One
j of their main criticisms is that

comparing the effectiveness of

S treatments and publishing the re-
: sults could allow insurance com-
 panies to "ration care based on the

cost of treatments with similar

7 effectiveness — in other words,
I a more expensive treatment that
. works only as well as a cheaper
3 one might not be cove;r.ed;._. ~35 A A

 

:Foi:ithe mostiivpart, 

Really, there are few dow -

 sides to a plan designed to com-
; pare the effectiveness of medical
5 treatments, at least for consumers.
: Rather than be swayed by poten-

tial costs, people will ﬁnally have

solid evidence about the relative
strengths and weaknesses of dif-
ferent treatment options. This
will allow people to make more
informed decisions about their
own health.

The plan should also help to
decrease insurance costs, because
insurance companies will not
have to pay for expensive treat-
ments without assurance that they
would be no better than a simpler
or less costly one.

It will also keep them from
spending extra money on unnec-
essary therapy or extra medicines,
saving both consumers and the
companies themselves the extra
costs. 1,

Problems do exist in the pro-
posal, though. One major con-
cern is that the research will not
differentiate between sexes or
ethnic groups, instead opting for
testing across a generalized swath
of the population. Insurance
companies willing to save money
could potentially ignore that dif-
ferent treatments work better in
certain minority groups, or for
one sex over the other. -

Insurance companies might
also refuse to cover treatments

   

;_4.that are similar in effectiveness
‘_»__..but different in recovery tiinekor ’
3 seems like a good plan’;  health 
- care consumers are insulated fromi
 the costs of procedures by insur-
 ance companies, not to mention
 a lack of evidence on the relative
 effectiveness of different medical
; procedures.” P ~ ._:

“-'the amount of support involved.’
'For instance, physical therapy

might be just as good as surgery,

Auto bailout stalls the inevitable

 
    
 

by Molly Green
Colum/2121!

Most people already know that
the US automobile industry is dy-
ing. Forbes Magazine’s assessment of
Detroit as “1’imerica’s Most Miserable
 ’ was just a couple extra gallons of
salt on already festering wounds

Now General Motors and Chrysler
IIC, which received a combined total
of $17.4 billion in federal loans, must
attempt to persuade the Obarna ad-
 that the companies have a
viable ﬁiture —-— or else the government
could withdraw its loans and leave the
industryto drowninits ownreﬁ.1se—
that is, warehouses upon warehouses
of oversized, over—oiled and overpriced
SUVs

Accepting the always—coveted role
of the “deciders,” Treasury Secretary
Tim Geithner and National Economic
Council Chairman Larry Summers

C were appointed by President Obama

to lead what’s  called a “presiden-
tial task force on autos,” a sampling
of officials across several government
agencies that seeks to provide advice
and  about the auto industry, ac-
cording to the Washington Post.

This decision deviates from
Obama’s  plan 110 appoint alone

"‘§‘carczar"’tooverseethe restructuring

at the industry

But I’m weary of the ultimate de-
cisiontocrearzeataskforce, fortwo
reasons

First and foremost, I’m rather dis-
appointedbythelackofacarczar,
especiallybecause the Obarna adrninis—
tration took the time to make it rhyme

And it undoubtedly would have

CV81‘.

Second, seriously, don’t Geithner

and Summers have other  to
worry about? Like maybe, I don’t know,
the  crisis? And since when are
they the ultimate authority on the auto
industry?

Not that I doubt the economic
knowledge of either Geithner or Surn-
mers-—- though it has to be said, last
year wasn’t really a resume builder for
either one —-— but the idea of a car czar
made sense to me: Someone could de-
vote all of his attention to the problems
plaguing the automobile industry.

These are big problems

For years American-owned auto
companies have struggled to compete
against the cheaper and more progres-
sive foreign-owned companies like
Toyota and Honda In the last year,
thanks to your friendly neighborhood
recession, US auto proﬁts are hurting

s a
I'm rather disappointed
by the lack of a car czar,
especially because the Obama

administration took the
time to make it rhyme and

everything.  E

more than ever. _‘

According to MarketWatch.com, as
of December, sales of all automobile
companies had reached record lows.
Chrysler, like a broken and wet dog,
led thepack—its saleswere downa
colossal 53 percent from last year. GM
fared  betterwith sales down just
31 percent ,

 or without a car czar, one has
to wonder how GM and Chrysler can
feasibly turn around those numbers, es-
peciallyinashortperiod of time.

One might say, when a company
———orentireindustry—reaches rock
bottom, it cangonlygo up Except, I’m
pretty sure the auto industry can get

worse Though I can’t help but think,
“This is what General Motors gets for
 the Hummer,” I also 
the importance of a U.S.—owned auto
industry —-— namely, American jobs

According to Obarna adviser Da-
vid Axelrod, “One  dear—re-
ally two We need  an auto industry in
this country

"There are millions of lives, liveli-
hoods that depend on it. Not just at the
auto companies, but spin—oE manu-
facturers,dealers andsoon.\Y/ehavea
real interest in seeing the auto industry
survive,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the
Press”

Predictably, Axelrod couldn’t spec-
ify how to save the auto industry, only
saying that it would “require sacriﬁce
not from the auto workers, but also
from the creditors, from the sharehold-
ers and the executives who run the
company. Please note the overall vague-
ness of this quote

Meanwhile, according to The New
York Times, Obarna has still not ruled
out the possibility of a govemment-

While this might seem drastic to
some, in a state of economic uncer-
tainty, it goes without saying that no-
body 100 percent knows which direc-

One Plain slice

Backpacks pack apunch over purses

 
   

by Ben Korman

 

I might as well come out and say
it: Iwas notverytunedin togender
politics when I was in kindergarten.
The only topical ‘comments I was
willingtomakewerethatboysgotol
college to get more knowledge and
that  go to Jupiter to get more
stupider. After 16 years of exhaustive ,
education, I now know that the latter
is not only grammatically incorrect
but debatable as well; I’m now in col-

lege andlhave seen  in several of _

my classes.

 back on those blithe
days of shameless nose-picking, I
have noticed one key differehce be-

tween kindergarten  and college .

 — and it is not theirlikelihood
of  to me.

The difference is that in kinder-
garten the majority of my female
classmates carried their belongings
in practical, no-ﬁills backpacks, while
their collegiate counterparts employ

a diverse rotation of large, ornate
handbags

Males, on the other hand, have re-
mained faithful Most of us have not

only continued our backpack usage

into our early 20s but have also devel-
oped close, meaningful relationships
with our bags ,

When Iwas faced with the chal-

lenge of  my lunch, text- .

books, notebooks and gym uniform
to my underfunded, locker-less 
school, my backpack was there.
When I was informed at the air-
port check-in counter that my lug-
gage was overweight and I therefore
had to transfer 3.2 pounds of stra-
 packed belongings onto my
person to avoid a $75 ﬁne, my back-
pack -— which I thenceforth called
Kenneth — helped me carry on.
When some overzealous second-
graders tiied jumping me for my milk
money and I merely needed a make-
shift shield with which to deﬂectthe
eye pokes, Kenneth  ~my back.
It was solid, yo. Kenneth was there
when I got my acceptance letter to

subsequent dominance in the carry-
an-egg-on-a-spoon relay, I owe in no
small part to Kenneth.

When I was informed at the

my luggage was overweight,
- my backpack — which I
thenceforth called ‘Kenneth
—— helped me carry on.

I understand that backpacks
aren’t for everyone, ‘and that purses
have their advantages..Take variety,
for instaiice —— they come in virtually
all shapes and sizes. Unfortunately,
none seem to accommodate the av-
erage mid-range laptop very well

There are purses that sparkle,

and purses that wrinkle.

However, all this aesthetic fluff
comes at the expense of- durability,
and it is highly doubtful that any bag
 the above descriptions will
last more than a few years, a mere
fraction of Kenneth’s current age,
which is seven and three-eighths.

There might even be health risks
associated with  purses. The
American Chiropractic Organization
has reported "that the asymmetry of
Carrying '3 Single-Str3PP6d bag can

4 those who wear  are more

likely to go their entire lives without
 a single check to a chiroprac-
tor. ’ ‘

Still, some women insist on car-
ryingtwopurses atatime,wedginga
hand into each armpit to relieve the
pressure of the taut straps on each
shoulder. In such cases I often imag-
ine that they are constantlydoing the
“I don’t warma be a chicken” part of
the Chicken Dance If wearing Ken-
neth makes me appear as if I amdo-
ing any dance, it would probably be a
really cool one, like the moonwalk.

So, why do some women con-

  

tinue to schlep around these massive
purse behemoths despite the burden
placed on their vertebrae, not to men-
tion wallets? To impulsively deem it a
product of female materialism would
be a superﬁcial judgment — after all,
itisguyswhowearshortsinwarm
weather despite the fact that skirts al-
'low far better  circulation'— and
trust me, we need it more It is then
understandable that some are unwill-
ing to sacriﬁce this essential facet of
gender identity, even for the afore-
mentioned reasons ’ .
I invite those who plan on con-
 their singe-strap approaches
to take solace in the following anal-
ogy: On the ABC drama “Lost,” if
Jack Shephard’s female suitors each
represented a different variety of per-
sonal carryall, Ehe  yet clini-
cally insane Kate Austen would be a
-chic yet unwieldy purse while Dr. Ju-
liet Burke would be a practical, hom-
ey, down-to—earth knapsack. And
' thanks to that near ﬂash—forward sys-
a tem theyfve got going, we even know
who he ends up choosing —— the one

with the most baggage.

disagree For all its pop, sparkle and
glam, the movie is a step in the right
direction for aspiring fashionistas.
Unlike its predecessors, like “Sex and

i the City,” it has some semblance of a

conscience

“Sex” is a world of couture with-
out consequence, where women like
Carrie Bradshaw can afford to live in
fabulous rent—cont:rolled Upper East
Sidebrownstones,snatchingupMano—
10s as if they don’t cost $700 a 

Like Bradshaw, the heroine of
“Confes sions,’ ’ Rebecca Bloomwood
(Isla Fisher), is a working journalist
with an insatiable, near-erotic passion

for fashion — the only difference is
that if Bradshaw existed in the real
world, she too would be long buried
under a mountain of consumer debt
for her indulgences. '
I V  then, does “Sex” get a
ﬁee pass? According to Rotten-

Tomatoescorh, it received almost

exactly as many positive reviews as

negative, easily trumping the widely‘

skewered “Confessions.” It seems
that Bloomwood really can’t catch a

break, whether receiving  re-
views,  debt collectors or try-

 to impress her mega-hottie new 4

boss. Precedent suggests that crit-
ics should spare, “Confessions” the
death sentence’ on the grounds of

being sirnple-minded chick—lit turned
chick—ﬂick ‘

The verdict? “Confessions” is too
realistic. True, the movie’s plot is actu-
ally about as realistic as an ‘episode of
“The Flintstones,”'but the devil is in
the details — and probably in Prada.

Bloomwood ' is heavy in debt
She’s afraid to answer the phone
because she’s out of excuses for the
bill collectors. Critics purport that
they are offended at her dire circum-
stances being played for laughs, but
the true reason critics have made this
movie a scapegoat is the seriousness
of Bloomwood’s dilemma — a seri-
ousness from which the movie sur-
prisingly doesn’t shy away.

ries of books by Sophie Kinsella, follows

debt with nothing more than a plucky at-
titude and a cute smile. \While the ﬁlm was
shot before the mortgage bubble burst, its
subject matter cannot help but strike a sore
nerve with its current audience.

Of course, there is more to “Shopahol—
ic” than Rebecca’s ﬁnancial woes — she is
also pursuing a glamorous internship at a
fashion magazine by getting a foothold in
the company’s ﬁnancial magazine, Success-
ful Saving. b

As a result, Rebecca spends most of the
ﬁlm hiding her enormous debt from her

February 17, 2009

Shopping addiction

makes for fun ﬂick

hunky boss, Mr. Brandon (Hugh Dancy),
who falls in love with her in a painfully pre-
dictable fashion.

It quickly becomes evident that ‘there
is no salvation for the romantic-comedy
side of the f1lm’s plot. Plagued by absurd
amounts of cliche, hit—or—rniss slapstick
humor and completely unbelievable coinci-
dences, it is by far the film’s biggest ﬂaw.

Luckily, there is a lot of good remain-
ing in “Shopaholic” when the stereotypical
rom—com plot is ignored. The themes of
the film -— mostly surrounding Rebecca’s
spending issues — resonate with much
greater poignancy than the generic com-
mitment or sexual issues that anchor down
most romantic comedies. Notwithstanding
the poor timing, debt problems are some-
thing that almost everyone in the United
States can understand and empathize with.

In addition, “Shopaholic” transmits this
theme well, effectively getting across its
suffocating nature — especially regarding
the insidious force that is the debt collec-
tor.

What is perhaps most surprising about
“Shopaholic,” however, is the impressive
cast. Beyond Fisher’s and D.ancy’s, star-
tlingly strong performances, the support-
ing cast features greats like John Goodman

and Joan Cusack (as Rebecca’s hilariously

embarrassing parents) and smaller roles
from Fred Armisen, John Lithgow and
Kristin Scott Thomas. Ultimately, the cast
is the saving grace of the film, as it keeps
this ﬂick from becoming an all—out mean-
ingless farce, and it even manages to evoke
a few genuine laughs.

Speaking
up for the
shopaholics

Shopaholic Haters, page 10

Were the movie truly offensive, it would sug-
gest that Bloomwood could wipe away her debt
using the same fairy—tale magic that wins her way
into the dreamy boss’s heart It would make the
solution to that conflict as painless as every oth-
er problem she so effortlessly licks with nothing
but spunk and charm.

At the end of the movie, the only recourse she
has to settle her debtsiis to sell all her belongings.

She loses all her worldly possessions to 
herself out of the mess she created with con-
sumer greed. Not nearly as cute as romancing
her boss with a tango or other shenanigans —
it’s tragically true to life, a shocking reminder in
Bloomwood’s land of make-believe that some
problems have only painful solutions

Thus, I rest my case. Familiar rom-com tropes
and silly plot notwithstanding, “Confessions”
isn’t the worst-reviewed movie of the weekend
because it makes light of a national ﬁnancial cri-
sis — it’s because its ending is eenly prescient
of the difﬁcult decisions ahead for all of us

It might not be offensive, but it sure isn’t
much fun, either.

13.1-

Fisher leads impressive east through tired plot

Confessions, page 12

Fisher in particular gives an amazing per-
formance for a ﬁlm of this genre, genuinely
expressing Rebecca’s manic personality
while still retaining emotional signiﬁcance
in the ﬁlm’s few dramatic scenes.

Perhaps her only major ﬂaw is that
Fisher and her life seem so desirable that it
makes it hard to believe there’s a void she’s
ﬁlling with her shopping, especially because
a lover -— in Mr. Brandon — comes along
so easily. But there is little disputing that the
ﬁlm hinges on being able to empathize with
Rebecca and her plight —— and Fisher hits
that note perfectly.

Unsurprisingly, “Shopaholic” wraps it-
self up far too neatly, but by that point a bit
more predictability doesn’t really take away
from the ﬁhn.

In fact, this is the big surprise of the
ﬁlm. \While there’s plenty of cliche and con-
trivance to complain about, those mistakes
somehow don’t quite take the same toll on
“Shopaholic” that they usually do on ro-
mantic comedies.

Somehow, “Shopaholic” —— whether
through the strength of its cast or its fairly
unique message — manages to be way bet-
ter than the sum of its parts.

The Littman Test

by Adam Littman
Senior Staﬂ Writer

Afterhelping the Pitt foothallteam to a rousing
3-0 defeat in the Sun Bowl, oﬁensive coordinator
Matt Cavanaugh left to take a position as quarter-
backs coach of the New YO1l{J€tB.

The move leaves the Panthers with a decent-

gsized hole——about two or three yards tightup the
middle at most— in their  staﬂf On the
plus side, as his ﬁrst move with thejets, Cavanaugh

Pitt falls on beam, then to

by Laura‘Veith
For The Pitt Newa

Battling illness and nerves, Pitt gym-
nasts ended a two—meet winning streak,
falling to the University of Maryland on
Friday, 194.650-194.050.‘

. Starting out with high marks on the
vault and a season—high score on the bars,
the Panthers led in both enthusiasm and
points going into the third rotation.

But the beam proved too narrow, as
two Pitt gymnasts fell, giving the Terra-
pins a 0.7-point lead going into the ﬁnal
zotation.

There, shaky ﬂoor routines didn’t help
the Panthers as Maryland cruised to a 0.6-
point victory.

“The team that stays on the beam is
usually the team that wins. And we didn’t
do that,” said Pitt coach Debbie Yohm~
an.

A fall on the beam is a O.5—point de-
duction, and with the Panthers recording
two falls while Maryland hung on, Pitt

 

Maryland after early lead

could only hope that the Terrapins broke
down in the final rotation.

“One fall on the beam usually means a
loss,” said Yohman. “I think we’re feeling
too conﬁdent on the beam and we need
to be worried to be better.”

The Panthers anticipated a close match,
but expected to come out on top.

‘We lost because we got a little ner-
vous on the beam, and that’s where we
needed to hit our routines,” said freshman
Alicia Talucci.

Talucci posted a career—high all-around
score of 39.050, taking second to Mary-
land’s Brandi George.

The team will be back in the gym this
week, working on cardio to help members
overcome ﬂu symptoms.

“The players are under the weather,
but we can’t use that as an excuse,” said
Yohman.

The Panthers will host Michigan State
on Friday at 7 p.m. at the Fitzgerald Field

House.
