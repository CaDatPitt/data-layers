(Editor's note: In coordination
with Contributing Editor George
Lies, staff writers Virginia Joyce
and Peggy Allen prepared this
Pitt News report on the bomb-
ing of a Tower 8 dormitory room.)

Authorities are still investi-

‘ gating the early Tuesday morn-

ing bombing of Room 405,
Tower B, by persons who used
“an extremely lethal” home-
made pipe bomb.

The residents of the room, Tony
Embessi and David Rohanna,
were not home at the time of the
3:25 a.m. blast.

Ironically, Embessi — a fellow
who doesn’t go out at night much
— had gone to a friend’s room to

. listen to records. Rohanna "was
out of town.

According to Charles
the superintendent of security
services on. campus, the pipe
bomb is “a standard type of des-
structive bomb” which is “ex-
tremely lethal.”

Police estimated damage tothe
room at between five and six hun-
dred dollars. However, ’ Ray
added that if someone had been in

the room the person could have been

injured by:

—Flying Pieces of shrapnel from
the steel pipe. _

—Smoke and/or the fire.

Anti-War
Protest In

"Mellon Park

A motley crowd of more than
three hundred’ baked in the sun
Monday at noon to applaud, heck_-
1e and observe a Bastille Day ral-
ly held in Mellon Park, downtown.
Gray-suited businessmen pushed
against long-haired students of
both sexes to hear Bill Rodd, form-
er official of the Pittsburgh Pov-
erty Program, introduce a ros-
trum of speakers, most of whom
had the University-of-Pittsburgh
label attached to their names in
some fashion or other. -

Rodd kicked off the peaceful
rally by informing his listeners
that the city solicitor’s office
had been “fully advised of the
plans and that those intend-
ing to demonstrate against a city
ordinance prohibiting public as-
semblies in the park would not
block access in any way.”

The white-haired speaker re-

vealed that there were two pur-
poses to the gathering: to test the
constitutionality of the prohi-
bition against using the park for
peaceful public meetings, and to
register opposition to the covert

' support that Pittsburgh corporate

interests are giving the ABM
buildup.

Sandy Dolan,
from the North Side, vehemently
questioned the equation of “$35
in-
dustry from the war in Viet Nam
to the 35,000 men killed there.”

Her question was taken up and
expanded by Ed Fuller of the
Pittsburgh Draft Resistance and
graduate student at the Univer-
sity. “Your children will ask

try was, being" destroyed, when

“Anybody that uses this (pipe
bomb) has got some know-how,”
Ray said. “It's not something kids
mess around with in the back-
yard.”

“It’s the same type used to bomb
our police van (last summer),”
he added.

The effects of the fire bomb
extended half way into the room,
searing ‘clothing hanging in the
closet, and painting the walls
and floor black with the residue
of smoke. A bag of golf clubs lean-
ing against a bed and a portable
television facing the doorway were
untouched.

The events of the Monday am
were outlined by Embessi’s neigh-

bors in Tower B, Bart Bakaley ‘I

‘and James Scanla. Bakaley report-
ed that soon after he heard Em-
bessi summoned from his room by
a friend to “listen to records,”
he noticed the footfalls and
laughter of more than one person
then a slammed door outside 405.

Within minutes, the sound of a
blast and the smell of smoke
brought the fourth floor residents
from their rooms. Assuming that
Embessi was still behind the flam-
ing door, ‘one student burned his
hands pounding on the floorlto
arouse him.

Free High School
‘Absolutely Free’

by CARLA SYDNEY STONE
Staff News Writer

Daniel Weiner, a tenth grade-student at Taylor Alderdice High
School has organized “an experiment in unstructured learning where
the teacher would not be more prestigious than the students.”

' The Free High School which meets four nights _a week at the Rodef
Shalom Temple, IS, according I to co-ordinator Fron Jacob, “free in
every sense of the word free. It is education geared to self-motivation.”

Steve Davis, a faculty member at
the University who serves as the
resource person to the project
said; “_I think it’s fun and very ex-
citing.” Propoganda teacher Wil-
liam Sypher likes theidea of a
free high school because “here
there is no pressure for grades,
people feel at ease to disagree
with the teacher.”

The school offers unusual cour-
ses. Weiner says that “teachers
turned me off to the courses I
did like, and subjects I am really
interested in are not ‘offered in
high school.” David agreed. “the
high schools are in dire straits.
The high schools can not offer
electives _to students, and often
the electives the students want,
they‘ can not take.” Here, the stu-
dents can take anything they want
and if they don’t like a class,

b they can try another.”_’ V -. i _ ,
‘ .,;,J3CQb S§i,d'. “If’a"group"o§=5kids--

hav a ide f u_

 

would like to take, they can come
to us with the suggestion and we
will try to find a teacher to teach
it.” ‘

“The inflexibility of the high
schools,” Davis said, “is one of
the reasons for the great dislike

- of the system. The students want

more personal freedom to choose
. . . There is definately a need for
the Free High School” Weiner sta-'
ted that “Teachers do not consid-
er us people until we reach twenty-
one. Until then, we are not allow-
ed to make decisions. This atti-
tude really turned me off.”

Originally Steve Davis had plan-
ned a study-group for bright high
school students over the summer.
They would read material far
above the usual high school level
and then get’ together and discuss.

Collins about his “long” hair. The
first reaction of Collins and friend
Bob Scalese, graduate student,
was to ignore the incident.

“When Bob warned them to
leave us alone, one of ‘the guys
gave him a drop kick to the back of
the _neck_,—” related Miss Hirsh-
berg. She reported that he was
jumped by four or five of theat-
tackers when he stood up to fight
back. .

The young lady, wearing dark
glasses and a large bandage over
her right/ eye on Tuesday after-
noon, spoke of how she received
her injury. “I started pulling one

of them off Bob and he started

yelling ‘I don’t hit girls, I don’t
hit girls.’ Noble pig.” - ,

“I kicked him really hard and
he let me have it. I remember
falling on the ground in a little
pile and thinking, “Why don’t
you lie here and make them think
they killed you. ‘Maybe they’ll get
scared and run away,” she said.

While this ensued, Collins" had
run tothe door of the Cathedral
to summon help from a campus
policeman. His pounding and ye]-
ling dispersed the group.

Miss Hirshberg was than taken
to the Health Center and from there
sent to Presbyterian Hospital.

Shortly thereafter, Collins rec-
ognized one of the youths on the
street as having been among the
attackers. A city policemanon duty
in MacDonald’s apprehended the
sixteen-year-old boy and transport-
ed him to Oakland Police Station.

“There is no clearcut motive
for the attack. A campus police-
man stressed that there ,was no
racial component involved.

During the meeting, the Coun-
cil passed several resolutionsjto .

easier.

Students may now take double‘ . .

receive recognition for each on /«

fective immediately, an_d students.
will soon receive letters explain-_ , ;
ing the new academic program. i

The two other main propos- 
als which were passed are the post-'.:.
baccalaureate year and addition-.;

graduate students. With the post,’ '‘

This would normally be classified
as post-baccalaureate work and no‘
credit toward a degree would be"
granted by the College. Dean‘
Schneewind noted that this new _s
element along with the tiitorial..;
transitional programs, - would help -'5
form a “flexible and undergrad‘-— .' ‘

Students may now also take an .,f ’
unlimited number of graduate '
courses for credit toward an" un-  -

A new proposal was submit-
ted regarding the procedures in_ A

dent the right to appeal his case _ ‘
to Integrity Board for a decision.-

It was agreed by the Council that V
a separate review board should
be set up for these cases. ’ “

5. Helped organize the Pitts-

We wish to emphasize that SDS
is not a tightly-disciplined organ-

members are expected to follow.
National officers do not issue
“directives” or order anybody
around. SDS chapters enjoy al-
most complete local autonomy.
The internal life of Pitt SDS is
characterized by flexibility,
free discussion, and thorough,
non-exclusionary democracy,

We are aware of the fact that
many people seem to feel that the
cause of campus unrest is some
national (or even international)
conspiracy to disrupt American
society and that SDS is a central
link in this conspiracy. It is our
belief that such a conspiracy theory
is quiteerroneous; we have been ~
aware of the painfully disorgan-

ized condition of our own national

organization for too long to be
able to seriously accept the theory
that it is’ masterminding such a
sophisticated strategy. We know
of no such conspiracy and feel con-
fident in assuring you that no
such conspiracy in fact exists.

We believe the growth of cam-
pus unrest is a part of a larger
problem, an increasing anger and
discontent among more and‘more
people throughout the country. Un-
rest among students is well-known.

V Similarly, discontent among op-

pressed black people has result-
edain both non-violent mass ac-
tions and urban disorders. Among

workers there has been a pheno-

menal increase in- authorized
strikes, wild cats, and intra-un-
ion insurgencies. ncreasing num-
bers of white collar and profes-
sional workers are also becoming

, disaffected, as is demonstrated by

the growth of trade union mili-
tancy among these groups.

Such disaffection flows from
a variety of grievances and in-
justices, among which are the con-
tinuation of the war in Vietnam
and conscription, rising taxes
wasted on militarism, inflation,
poverty, deeply-entrenched in-
stitutional racism, a sense of pow‘-
erlessness and alienation among
large numbers of people. ’

We believe that, to a large ex-

_ tent, these problems are rooted

in the lack of real democracy in
the United States. We define de-
mocracy as a system in which each
person has a meaningful say in
the decisions "affecting his (or

' her) life. This implies an equal dis-

tribution of power. Such an equal
distribution of power does not exist
in the United States. Instead,
enormous power is concentrated
in the hands of a corporate elite
which owns and controls Ameri-
can industries, vast national re-
sources, transportation and com-
munications systems, vast in-

formation ‘and opinion-making
systems, millions of jobs and many
billions of dollars.

One-half of 1 per cent of the
populations owns more than 25
per cent of all wealth. Also, 1
per cent of adults holds 76 per
cent of all corporate shares. The
top 100 corporations owns 58
per cent of all corporate assets.
These are only three of a wealth
of statistics which can be cited
to illustrate the scope of this
corporate elite. (A further exam-
ple of the power of this grouping
can be found in the enclosed study
of the University of Pittsburgh’s
board of trustees.)

Not only does this small and
powerful strata of society dom-
inate the day-to-day s0cio-eco-
nomic life of the nation, it also
enjoys great political power.
We believe that the locak, state,
and national governments accept
the assumptions and respond to
the general needs of this group
to a far greater extent than they
do to any other social class. We
believe that this group plays a de-
cisive role in defining our nation-
al priorities and that these priori-

ties run counter to the best in-,

terests of the American people.

We do not mean to say that there
is any I“conspiracy of. wealth.”
We simply believe that great
political inequality exists, that
this flows from the natural evolu-
tion of an economic oligarchy,
and that this has resulted in the
crippling of democracy and the
rise of great social problems.
The outlooksand beliefs of those
who are a part of this oligarchy
are shaped by the needs of cor-
porate power, not by the needs of
the great majority of the Ameri-
can people. -

“Conspiracy theories’’' and re-
pressive legislation will
serve to divert attention away from
these realities. But the realities

he shouted.

“To carry a draft card is to be

-an accomplice to this war and the

next one,” continued Fuller amid
applause and booing.

Fuller’s comments were encor-
ed by a soft-spoken Josh Chason,
teaching fellow in History here.
“We must question ourselves as
to what extent are the values of
the people occupying these build-
ings around us are our values,”
he began. He spoke against hating
others, against labelling police
“pigs” '

It goes back to self-hatred,”
Chason believes. “We can get rid

of ,self—hatred by beginning to
love ourselves and then to love

.others. The center must be non-
violent resistence,' resistance
headlong into the conflict of val-
ues and changes.”

While the microphone was blar-
ing into the wind, a leaflet was
passed among the listeners which
condensed the issues at hand:

1) End the war profiteering of
our oligarchs.

2) End their lobbying for the
ABM.

3) Tell their Washington pup-
V pets to withdraw all military sup-
port for the Thieu-Ky "regime in
Viet Nam. '

‘Inhibitions Create Problems,’

Laments Project Coordinator-

(Continued from Page 1)
tried to start a Free School, and
Daniel Weiner were not satisfied

' with this. They wanted something

 

that wouldinclude others who were
also dissatified with the curri-

culum of the high schools and

wanted to learn something that

ment more to them.i

Weiner and Jacob didthe pub-

licity, planning, and coordina-

tion. Davis phoned various fac-

ulty members who would be

qualified to teach the courses in
which the students would be in-
terested. Persons throughout the

University, Carnegie-Mellon Uni- -

versity, United Oakland Minis-
try, ‘Rodef Shalom Congrega-
tion and the community became
very interested. As a consequence,

the whole “casual organization” i

took about a week.

Weiner has high hopes for the
success of the school. “Pressure

is a false motivation for‘ learning.
Teachers have substituted grades
for motivation. Here,,where there

is no pressure, the research turned .

by the students should be of a much
higher quality than that in the"
regular schools simply because

the students are here voluntarily

and are more interested inwhat

they are doing. So they should do.
much better work.” ‘

Sypher agrees. “The students
here are brighter and more stim-
ulating than the average under-
graduate at Pitt. They have a
healthy skepticism and are quite
enthusiastic about the high
school.” In his class, he suggest-
ed the reading material and im-

mediately a student asked if ‘she '

could borrow the book.

“Do we need three hundred

by DAVE TIERNAN
“Aris! . . . Aris! . . . Aris!”
“I’m coming,. Mom. I just wanta finish

hi ;_ this chapter.”

“‘I don’t know what I’m going to do with

 that child,” Aris’ mother stated aloud as
a she strode from the foot of the stairs tow-
I ard the dining room.

“What’s the matter now?” Aris’ father

 asked, looking up from the evening paper.

“All he does anymore is read up there

.1 in his brother’s old room. He doesn’t play

with the other kids on the street, or any-

thing anymore. And even if he just read, ,

it wouldn’t be so bad. But he only reads in

Butch’s old room. He won’t read down
, There. Oh, I don’t know. Maybe it’s normal
' for a ten-year-old, I don’t know.”

Aris had finished the chapter of The

" 1' Rookie Who Made It, but he didn’t go down-

stairs. He sat on the floor of the large bed-
room and stared at the picture on the wall.

. It had always interested him, but today it

seemed to be more appropriate. The tan-
ned image of his brother reminded him of
what “the Rookie” must have looked like
at_that age. He could barely remember his

-A-brother, but the memories he had were

fond ones.
“Aris, get down here. Dinner’s ready,

'=_."§ and your mother called you 15 minutes ago.
.  And wash your hands before you come to
.. the table.”

Aris felt sorry for his father. He always

1. seemed to be tired and unhappy. The only

time he smiled was when he was watching

7 the ball games on television and the team

he was rooting for did something right. The
rest of the time, he either sat in his chair
and read the paper or slept. “Hard day
down there today,” his father would say

 when he returned from working in the
ﬂ mines. And often he would walk slowly
— - , toward the stairs and say, “Have to get up

early in the morning, gonna hit the hay ear-
ly,” and go to bed—often before the sun had

', slipped down behind the West Virginia
“hills. .

After dinner Aris excused himself from

 the table and retreated to his favorite spot

in the world. He propped his back against
the neatly-made bed and continued his book.

 _But_ he soon lost interest and began to

browse through the drawers of his broth-

‘ er’s desk. (He had often been tempted to

look in the top drawer, but always limited
his investigations to the bottom two.) Here
he found numerous magazines containing
pictures of girls and cartoons, a few old

I school books and notebooks, and clippings

from the Morgantown newspapers about
Notre Dame football games. He recogniz-
ed serveral of the names from the old No-

-. ‘tre Dame teams as members of various

professional teams.
Aris neatly replaced the clippings in the

‘in bottom drawer and closed it. He sat in front

of the desk and stared at the top drawer. He
tried to remember the exact reason his

* mother had given him for not looking in the

top drawer. He couldn’t even remember if
she had actually forbidden him to look in it
or if she had just warned him not to. He slid
his slight body toward the desk, and slowly
moved his hand toward the drawer handle.
As if anticipating an electrical shock, he
moved his fingers toward the handle and‘

. pulled them quickly away. He repeated this

action three times before he let his hand
rest on the handle. He. slowly pulled the

',handle, and experienced a strange shiver

all over his body when he realized that the
drawer was not locked, as he had always
suspected.

The fear that crept over Aris’ body was
a new experience to him. He did not know
why he was afraid to look into the drawer.

, He tried to strain his mind to its limits to

remember anything he could to explain his
fear to himself.

After long minutes had passed slowly
by, Aris slowly inched his head toward the
drawer. With great caution he stretched
his neck and investigated the drawer with

Vsquinting eyes. His body was tense, as"if
_ he expected a snake to leap out at him. All

his eyes saw, however, was a tabloid news-
paper and some notepaper with writing on
-it. ‘

The_ sight quickly eased the tension in
Aris’ body, almost without thinking about
what he was doing, he took the newspaper

_‘ and. notepaper out of the drawer and began
 i to. _read the newspaper. He noticed the
;  _h'eadline which stated “Waiting Is the Hard-

, goi4}-—"rHE Pr1"r"NE WS”—-Friday,’ Juiy 18. 1969  

°oyin lhe

I

est Part for Butch.” He scanned the page
and in the smaller print read that the news-
paper was the University of Pittsburgh’s
Pitt News. The date was November 22,

.1968. “That was over six years ago,”

Aris thought as he began to read the story
under the headline.

FARMINGTON, W. Va. — Butch will never be a stu-
dent at Pitt.

“l'll probably end up in the mines, like my father,”
Butch said as he stared at the shampoo bottles on the
shelf of the Champion Coal Company Store. He, along with
hundreds of other friends and relatives, was waiting to
hear an optimistic word about the 78 miners who were
trapped in the coal mine a few miles away.

“They try to keep their spirits up," he said, looking at
some of the others. They were huddled in groups of four
or five, talking in low voices. Their faces bore the same ex-
pression as Butch’s: sad, taut, weary; but their eyes told
the whole story. Many had kept the 36 hour vigil, waiting
for news of the trapped men, and their eyes were red and
swollen from lack of rest and crying. , _

“We're like a country of our own,” Butch noted. “We
live our lives in our own little ways during regular times;

this is like a country during a war—all the people band ‘

together to help each other."

Butch is 18, and said he couldn’t remember the dis-
dster in 1954 which" claimed the lives of l6 miners. He
also explained that after his graduation in June, he had
applied to work in the very mine that now held 78 men
captive. ‘‘I could have been working the midnight shift,
too," he said. “Most of the new workers start off on mid-
night."

Although he had no relatives trapped in the mine, six
of his friends were down there. “My father should have
been down there, too,” Butch said. “He was going to
switch shifts with a friend so we could go hunting today.
He changed his mind at the last minute and decided to
work his regular daylight shift.

“The mines are all we have,” Butch reflected. "Most
of us want to get away, but in order to get enough mon-
ey, we work in the mines for two or three years. By then
we have forgotten . . .," he trailed off as an older lady
behind him began to sob loudly.

In his conversation, Butch explained the complex laby-
rinth of tunnels as most kidshisl age would explain the
single wing or the table of chemical elements. Between

the lines of his explanation, however, was the pessim-
ism that was evident on the faces of the others. He also
explained the gases, explosions, and fires that were
hampering rescue attempts during the night.

“The waiting is the hardest part of this for us," Butch
added after a pause. "lf there was only something we
could do besides just standing around waiting . . .” Again
he trailed off, his voice choked with emotion.

Many of the miners who were trapped were sons or
nephews of the men who had lost their lives in the l954

disaster. Butch explained that families who lose their fa- .

thers do not move away, even though the company pays
them insurance.

“They have no place to go," Butch said of the father-
less families. “They have probably lived here for genera-
tions. This is the only life they know. To them the mines
are the only work their families have done since they
came to this country.”

During his conversation, Butch constantly referred to
his father, who was standing between the frozen food
and toy shelves in the next aisle. When asked about the
total number of miners employed in the mines, Butch
called to his father for an answer. The only response was
a sharp reply of “around 500,” accompanied by a hard,
cold glare. His father did not welcome the reporters gs
Butch did. To Butch’s father, we were intruders in “his
country." And, although Butch welcomed the chance to
talk to people from another “country,” ( even in the face

' of crisis), he related everything about the people, young

and old alike, to the mines.

mourning

Butch accepted the reality of a mining disaster. We
faced the reality of his future in the mines. He said that
the hardest part of the crisis for the people was the wait-
ing—-the helpless, hopeless waiting. For the majority of
people, the waiting was just time until the deaths of the
men would be confirmed. Few were blindly optimistic
about the survival of the miners.- They, too, accepted the
disaster as one of the dangers of the mines.

No, Butch will never be a student at Pitt. His future
is decided. All there is for him now is the mines and the
waiting—the hopeless,helpless waiting for the day when
he no longer “owes his sould to the company store.”

But for Butch, that day will never come.

Aris reread the story and stared at the
picture of his father and brother for a long
time before he glanced at the notepaper,
which he had almost forgotten about.

On the notepaper was a short letter. ad-
dressed to the person who had written the

article in The Pitt News. Aris guessed

from the crossed-over words that it must
have been a rough draft. As he read the let-
ter, he wondered if his brother had ever
mailed a copy, and if he had, had he re-
ceived an answer.

The rough draft was short, and.Aris re-
read it.

Dear Mr. _Tiernan,

Thanks for sending me a copy of
your story. I didn’t know how to take
it when I read it the first time, but af-
ter I read it through a few times, I
seemed to get the idea you felt sorry
for me. Well, don’t, because I’m get-
ting out of here. I’m going to make it
alone.

At the end of your story, you re-
peated that I will never be a student at
Pitt. Maybe not, but I’ll never be a coal
miner either. I’m going to join the
service, and if I don’t like it, I’ll be
free from this place when I get out and
I can get a job somewhere else.

I just thought you might want to
know.

Butch

The story and letter brought many mem-
ories to Aris’ mind. He strained to remem-
ber all he could, but the facts of Butch’s de-
parture from home were no clearer to him
than they had been the many other times
he had tried to remember.

‘ He decided that he would have to ask
his mother; He had always wanted to ask
her about Butch, but for some reason he
couldn’t remember, he had been afraid.
But now he felt he had to know. “But when,
and how, will I ask?” he thought. “Should
I tell her I looked in the drawer? Maybe
just mention him?” ‘ ‘_ ‘, I.

Aris stood up and looked at the clock on
the table beside the bed. It would soon be
time for him to go to bed, and he had to de-
cide when he would ask his mother. As he
thought about it more, he felt he had to
know immediately.

He descended the stairs slowly, going

‘over in his mind how he would ask his

mother about Butch.

Aris’ mother was in the kitchen sewing
one of his father's shirts when he entered
from the dining room._ She looked up from
her work as he slowly walked across the
floor, then continued her sewing. After he
stood in front of her for a while without
speaking or moving. she looked up again.

“Well?”
“I, ahh, I wanted to ask you a question.”
“Go ahead.”

“What happened to Butch?” Aris blurt-
ed out.

Aris’ mother thought for a long time be-
fore she spoke. By the look in her eyes,
Aris could tell that what she would tell him
would not be good. He felt a slight tremor
in his stomach, as if he was getting sick.
He wished he had waited until later to ask,
for he sensed that his mother was going to
tell him where Butch was, and he was
afraid to hear.

“Well, Aris, it’s a long story, but if you
want, I’ll tell you. I’ve wanted to tell you
for a long time, but wanted to wait until you
were old enough to understand. You see,

when Butch got out of high school, he want-

ed to work in the mines like your father.
While he was waiting to be hired, there was
an explosion in the mines and many of the
miners‘ were trapped for days, and they
were never found.”

,4-3..-

“You mean they all died?” he inter-_

rupted. _ ' .
‘Yes, they all died.”
Aris felt he should tell his mother that

he had read the newspaper and letter, but
before he could decide, she continued.

“Your brother ‘decided to get away
from the mines and see what else he could
do. He said before he left that he wasn’t
afraid of the mines, that he just wanted to
see more of the world beforehe spent the
rest of his life working here.” She stared
at the shirt she had been sewing.

“And,” Aris probed. “What happened
then?” “

“Butch joined the marines and was a
paratrooper. They’re the ones who jump
from airplanes to rescue people in trouble.’’

‘‘I know that,” Aris replied, a little in-
sulted, but too interested in what his moth-
er was saying to let it bother him. “Mom,
whe_re’s Butch now?” »

“Aris, like I said, I wanted to tell you

I this for a long time, but never knew when.

Your father never liked to talk about it,
and every time .I would try to discuss it
with him, he would become very upset.”

Aris looked at his mother very strange-
ly. He felt old, almost like a grown-up. He
wished he hadn’t mentioned it, but knew it
was too late to forget about it. He waited a
long time before his mother spoke.

“Your brother was killed in Vietnam’

about four years ago,” Aris’ mother said
slowly. Her eyes immediately filled with

tears, but they were tears for Aris not for
Butch.

-Aris stood in front of his mother with» ’

out speaking for what seemed to him to be
half the night. Twice she looked at him as

if she was going to finish telling the story, ’
but both times she looked back to her sew- .

ing. Aris finally felt he should say some-
thing, but couldn’t think of anything to say.
He felt he should apologize to his mother,

but he didn’t really feel he had done any-.

thing wrong. Then he turned, and with his
head bowed and tears in his eyes, he ran
through the living room, up the stairs, and
into his brother’s room.

Aris closed his book. The ‘crying had
made his eyes sore, and he couldn’t read.
He lay:; on the floor and closed his eyes.
Within minutes he was asleep. It was late,
and the long cry had exhausted him.

Aris’ mother sat in the kitchen. ‘She,
too, had become exhausted from crying.
But before she fell asleep, she thought not
of Butch, but of the shirt she would have to
finish sewing in the morning. “In the
mourning,” she had thought before sleep
overtook her, for there had never been a

mourningfor Butch.g ’ _ 1   x . 

' The Health Center Disaster

  

by HOBART HARRIS

Last Monday afternoon I slid
into second base wearing shorts.
Since I did it up at the University
All Purpose Athletic Fields.I did
a pretty good amount of damage
to myself. The fields are covered
with an exceptionally abrasive clay
compound. One third of the skin
on the calf of my left foot was
scraped away. After the bleeding
stopped, it seemed to be not too
serious, so that night I just wash-
ed it off and went to bed.

However, Tuesday morning I
woke up in pain bad enough to
make me limp quite noticeably.
After teaching a class (as a Grad-
uate Teaching Assistant), I went
over to Student Health, thinking
that the wound might have be-
come infected. By this time I could
barely walk. However, instead of
the attention I thought I would get
there I was told by the reception-
ist that the doctors would do noth-
ing for me because my problem
wasthe result of an accident, and
it was the policy of Student Health
not to treat accidents. That was
only done at the emergency room
of Presbyterian, and I would have
to get there on my own. I was told
this by. the receptionist after I had
told her what was the matter, and
after I had limped into the room,
obviously in pain.

“You’re kidding,” I said. “I’m
having a lot of trouble and I’m
really concerned about this leg.
Can’t someone at least look at it?
All I want to know is whether .it’s
infected. If it is, then I’ll do some-
thing myself. Can’t the doctor just
come out and look at it?”

The receptionist refused to call
a doctor, pointing out the Health
Services’ accident policy on a pro-
minent part of her desk. It was
very explicit and claimed that it
had been okayed by Student Gov-
ernment. Basically it claimed that
this gave the student the right to
choose his medical care from any
source he wants.

Hooray.

Thoroughly discouraged, I went
home that Tuesday afternoon and
did nothing, hoping it, would go
away. That night, however, the
pain was_ so intense I was not able
to sleep. ‘Wednesday morning I
taught another class. When the
class was over, I put in a last des-

' peration call to Student Health. I
" explained that I did not want spe-

cific care for the injury per se, i.e.
bandages or cleaning of the wound;
instead, I again told them that I
was extremely worried about in-
fection, that I could barely walk,
that I had no health insurance and
no doctor. I begged her to let a
doctor see me. This time the re-
ceptionist relented to the extent
of telling this to someone else, ei-
ther a doctor or nurse I guess, and

* then coming back with the ques-

tion, “Well, do you think you have
an infection?” ,
“That’s what I called to‘ ask
you,” I yelled, losing control.
-“wen, I think you’d better see a
doctor about it then,” she ended.

Unbelievable.

But this is just one story about
the Health Service. I spent the
rest of today telling some of my
friends about my experiences,

and discovered that almost every _

one of them has’ had the same
thing, or something quite similar
happen. Dan Milberg, another

teaching assistant in my depart-.
' ment, went to a picnic with his

wife last week. Several days later,
they discovered that Laurel had
what looked like a bad case of poi-

‘ son ivy. Laurel is in the counsel-

ing program here at Pitt and is
spending most of her time work-
ing in the community as fulfill-

ment of part of her department's .
. _ requirements for the degree. How-

ever, as such, she is not a full-
time student. So, when she called
the Health Service for help, she

—was turned down. “Sorry, they

said, if you’re not taking nine cred-
its, you can’t be taken care of.”
The fact that her husband was
taking nine credits was not consi-
dered sufficient either.

Perhaps poison ivy only afflicts
the studious.

But the worst horror story of

the three that I want to relate in"

this column happened to another
friend of mine. She fell down while
walking down the Cathedral steps,
causing her ankle to swell up, turn-
ing red and green and hurting her
terribly. She was helped to Stu-
dent Health by a friend. There in-
stead of even as much as having a
doctor look at her leg, she was
turned away. “Read the sign on
my desk,” the receptionist said.
She was not offered help -to get up
to Presby, where the sign says
treatment is available.

But this particular person was
luckier than the other two of us.
She was helped up the bill by her
friend, where a trainer from the
Human Energy Resources Lab
treated her. And you know what?
He didn’t even ask her how many
credits she had, or whether her in-
jury was the result of an accident.
He just helped her out because
she was in pain. I

And that, it seems, is a no-no
down at Student Health.

My point in writing this column
is that I think that there is a fun-
damental difference between
what a Student Health service
should be, and what it actually is
on this campus. To me, the Health
Service is there to serve the Uni-
versity community, defined as all
of usworking for or studying at
the University of Pittsburgh. As
such, the Health Service should
be prepared to provide whatever
services are needed, when they
are needed. Laurel Milberg’s poi-
son ivy was just as serious as if
she had been spending her 40
hours a week working towards
her degree in classwork; she just
happened to be fulfilling other re-
quirements this summer.

And even if she were not enroll-
ed in school at all, but simply
married to a man that was, I think
that legitimately makes her part
of the academic community. Grad-
uate Teaching Assistants are paid
$1,050 a term here. That is not an
awful lot of money. Our ability to
pay medical bills is almost non-
existent, and the added burden of
a wife’s can be impossible. Cer-
tainly the University, as our em-
ployer, should take some interest
in our health needs. I doubt if you
could find another employer of.
equal size anywhere in the state
of Pennsylvania that pays as little
attention to us as the University
does. And the crime of it is that
providing this increased service
would cost the University little or
nothing at all. The care could be
provided by the personnel and fa-
cilities of the Medical School and
teaching hospital. What this
means is that the cost to the Uni-
versity would be nowhere near or
comparable to the plans financed
by most institutions that have to
pay their employees’ bills doctor

by doctor. Here, of course, the
care could be performed free as
part of the training of the med stu-
dents, interns, and residents who
are attached to the University.

Most of all, I think that it is an
attitude that is lacking at Student
Health. Perhaps the best way to
show you what I mean is to look at
what happened to the girl with the
broken ankle. At Student Health,
she was turned down because of
an essentially beauracratic rul-
ing, even though it was obvious

that she was in pain. The letter of

the law was more important to
Student Health than the obvious
suffering of the patient. Up at the
Human Energy Research Lab,
however, the opposite was true.
The fact that she was hurt and in

_pain was reason enough for pro-
viding attention. The concern was
for her condition, and not for the
way things are normally run.

I have no objection to the Health
Service trying to arrange to have

as many accident cases as-possi- .

ble treated at Presby instead of
down at the Quandrangle. .I’m
sure they have good reasons for
this. But when a girl comes into
the office barely able to move and
in obvious pain, isn’t it more im-
portant to treat her than kick her
out without even offering her a
ride to where care is supposedly

'provided? Couldn’t the doctor at

least have walked out of his office
and looked at my leg? It wouldn’t
have set him back more than half a
minute, and would have saved me
a night’s agony and the $20 I
eventually had to spend with a pri-
vate physician to find out that my
leg wasn’t infected after all.
Where.are their priorities?

It seems to me that a good
Health Service would have an ac-
tive desire to help people, not just
a business—as-usual approach.
They should be actively concern-
ed with their patient’s welfare,
and not just view them as units
that must go through the proce-
dures in the proper way, or not at
all. Service should never be re-
fused at any unit of the Health
Service; if better facilities are
available elsewhere, fine, send
the students there. But at least
help them along if they’re hurt so

_ badly they can’t walk themselves.

Finally, the Health Service should
look at the world as a place pro-
viding opportunities to serve, not
as a series of problems to be solv-
ed. Credit restrictions should be
dropped. Immediate family mem-
bers should be treated as students
are, for in a very real sense, they
are as much a part ofthe Univer-
sity community as any of us go-
ing full time. People’s needs are
not and should not be measured in
units of full time or half time, ac-
cident or illness—and I would have
thought that the Health Service
would have been the first part of
the University to realize this, not

‘the last.

in that miserable weather, let alone inside Heinz Chapel.

I But on Thursday, that’s where I was: standing, kneeling, and think?
mg while my bright green sport shirt soaked—up the sweat gathered un-2
der my armpits. I’ll tell ya, I didn’t have to there. Not by any means. It

would’ve been better to stay in bed, you know.

But someone I knew at one time died, and I wanted .to be,there..His' 
name was Ben Grady, and probably you won’t recognize it but a couple-_
of years ago he was the swimming coach atPitt. I knew him because I"
covered the swimming beat for The Pitt News grand sports staff. I had’

to talk to him, maybe three times a week.

AS FOR BEING good copy, the man’s quotes read like the label/onﬂg
a toilet bowl. I missed his winning-years, so he wouldalways complain. 
that he didn’t have enough bodies to compete in meets. At the time I5 
knew him, his quotes were only good for comic relief. I had to pump him'_‘ _

for information, and I hated it. '

But I wasn’t standing in Heinz Chapel Thursdayand thinking about I _
what the man had to say about some slouch of a swimmer who didn’t-5‘:
care whether Grady lived or died. I went there Thursday to say good- 

bye to a man who could only find peace in dying.

Grady had problems that I hope I never have, but he did things that,»-is
I will never come close to doing. When I knew him, he coached by in-ff’

stinct. I missed Grady the_ winner, and it is only my loss, not his.

, When Grady was on top, he never bragged. He was a damn good: ..i if
swimmer, and as a coach, he had balls. He’d say what he thought about“ 
a situation and not beat around the bush likeitoo many persons do

around this University.

When he was down, he’d only say “what-a-ya gona’ do?” And he’d: 1'1:

shrug his shoulders. He had his fights with the Athletic Department.)

When he was winning, he got what he wanted. When he didn’t, they!

thought he was ready for the rocking chair.
HECK, THEY couldn’t carry his swimming trunks.

His name is splattered all over the record books, and the swim: 
mers he helped hold records as long as your arm. But if anyone remem- _ * 
bers, he’ll go down for helping to build that two million dollar swim-‘ 

ming facade on the hill just so swimming wouldn’t die.

Oh we would have our disagreements over something which *wasi:'-:'
printed, and he would claim that he was misquoted or said if off the rec-...
ord. But the thing about him I remember most is that he kept everybody’ ,2

in line, including nosey reporters.

Grady was a man who had seen more water in 58 years than I will _ 
see sleep in my lifetime. As a sailor, he sailed the Seven Seas and then 
some. If Captain Kidd knew him, Grady wou_ld’vsbeen his first mate,‘

Until, that is, Grady.found a way to take over the ship.

WELL, GRADY’S last ship sailed Tuesday when he was found dead I C ‘R
in his’apartment. And if anyone was there to see him go, they probably - _
would’ve seen Grady throwing his duffel bag over his shoulder, giving _ " '

a big grin, and then shuffling aboard the S.S. Peace.
That’s all he ever wanted. Bon voyage sailor.

Dr. Jack Critchfield, resigning assistant chan-
cellor, recently stated in a letter and in a follow-up
interview that “. . . the Chancellor has requested
the Director of the Physical Plant to determine the
changes which are needed to make the Hillman Li-
brary more accessible to handicapped students. It
is my hope that the necessary changes can be made
prior to the opening of school in September.”

Curb cuts so that the students can easily enter
the building are going to be the first improvements.
In both the "letter and the conversation, Critchfield
emphasized that a lack of funds has prevented the
University from making a study of all the buildings
on campus and the availability of facilities for the _
handicapped at the University.

One of the suggestions of the Cabinet was to de-

order,to provide an education for handicapped stu-

their opportunity to meet varied students.
