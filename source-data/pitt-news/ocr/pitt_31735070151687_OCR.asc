  Law could

a 0P9"
health care
market

Gideon, Bradshaw
News Editor

\

Legislation introduced Wednes-
day could impose state regula-
tion on the fight between the
area’s largest health insurer and
its biggest employer, Highmark
and UPMC, respectively.

Pennsylvania Rep. Dan Frankel,
D-Squirrel Hill, and Jim Chris-
tiana, R—BeaVer, havejointly in-
troduced a legi_slation package
of two bills that aim to make the
Pennsylvania health care mar-
ket more competitive. Under
the bills, large health care net-
works would not be able to tell
member physicians or facilities

-to deny access to patients based

on insurance. ”

According to a statement the
legislators released, the bills
would require any hospital and
individual physician practices
owned by a hospital system to
contract with “any willing in-
surer.”

Raymond Bradley did not want to
be conﬁ1sed with Ray Bradbury, a
famous 20th—centuryﬁction writer.

“I’m not Ray Bradbury talking
about science ﬁction. I’m Ray Brad-
ley talking about scientiﬁc facts,”
he said.

Bradley delivered the lecture

“The Science and Politics of Global
Warming” to a few hundred com-
munity members and university
students at the Carnegie Lecture
Hall Wednesday. Bradley, director of
the Climate System Research Center
atthe University of Massachusetts~
Amherst, was the second speaker
of the"3University Honors College

_ Climate Change Series.

The series, designed to educate
students and staff about energy
sources and consumption, began

. this past spring with an inaugural

lecture given by climate-change
expert, author and bloggerjoseph
Romm.

Edward Stricker, Dean of the
University Honors College, said the

Chemicals meet computers in a fusion between professors
Lindsay Passodelis
Staﬂ‘ Writer

Two professors have taken the idea of
wearable computing a step further than
Google Glass by working to create a fabric
that would’ help humans interact with their
environment.

Steven Levitan of the Department of
Electrical and Computer Engineering and
Anna Balazs of the Swanson School of
Engineering recently received a ﬁve—year,
$700,000 National Science Foundation
grant to build upon their_cllernical 
computational engineering“research.“” "

The work could have a huge impact by

- generating a new ﬁeld of “materials that

compute,” or systems where the computer
and the material are the same entity, sens-
ing, processing and reacting. The ability
to create smart materials would enable
new systems that could interface with hu-
mans to provide tactile, temperature and
photonic inputs to smart clothing, robotic
manipulators and -— possibly — prosthetic

‘ limbs. -

“This work can lead to a new research
discipline in computing and sensory-ma-
terials engineering that can transform hu-
man quality of life,” Balazs said.

Sara Peterson, a prosthetics coordina-
tor and orthotics and prosthetics instruc-
tor from the School of Health and Reha-

be used in both orthotic and prosthetic
applications. “ _ _ '
“Amputees currently do not have any
haptic feedback in their current typical
prosthetic sockets,” Peterson said, refer-
ring to communication using touch. “If the
professors at Pitt can create a chemical-

based computational fabric that could "

sense and respond to human motion, there
would-be applications for it in the ﬁeld of
prosthetics and. orthotics.”

Using this material as part of a pros-
thesis could help people that have had
severe burns to be able to feel again. The
engineers’ research with this computing
material could eventually help humans
interact withtheir environment by acting
as a tactile, temperature or light sensor.

Balazs has worked on modeling the os-
cillating gels known as Belousov-Zhabotin—
sky (BZ) gels, while Levitan has worked on

-using electrical oscillators.to do comput-

ing. BZ gels are known for pulsating and
reacting without any external stimuli. Such
a gel talks to itself, just as an amoeba com-
municates. Electrical oscillators, on the
other hand, produce a repetitive electronic
signal, and are used in various common
devices such as radios, video games and
beepers.

The National Science Foundation’s'

INSPIRE program, an awards program

complicated scientiﬁc problems that lie at
thetintersection of traditional disciplines,
granted the award. Its purpose is to encour-
age investigators to submit bold proposals
that some may consider to be at a disad-
vantage in a standard NSF review process.

Both professors‘, who joined _the en-
gineering. department at’ Pitt in 1987, de-
cided to put the two ideas together to model
chemical oscillators that compute.

Levitan said that helhad heard of re-
searchers studying the use of similar gels
for computing through academic literature,
so both professors decided to expand the
concept. I

As of now, and for the next ﬁve years of

the grant, they will focus their work on a '

model of the current idea.

They decided to put the gels in a thin '

sheet of fabric made of oscillating gel
patches — almost_like jello — and insert
that into a larger fabric,which contains
a piezoelectric ﬁlm that would generate
electricity when squeezed.

“We were talking about that and I was

saying, ‘Could we use those things to do
computing?” Levitan said.

The BZ gels will do the thinking and
analyzing, with implications for movement
or reaction to light.

“So if part of that gel also made a sand-
wich of that oscillating gel and piezoelec-

just oscillate but also generate electrical
signals,” Levitan said. “And now if it gener-
ates electrical signals, we could talk about
using it to do computing of some sort.”
The professors’ goal is to come up with a
computer model of the idea and then have
colleagues in other universities construct

it, but the project is still in its initial stages.‘

“The ideal computing material would
be lightweight and mechanically compliant
and would sense and respond to human
‘touch and motion in order to perform a

— level of computing that will enrich the life
of the human wearingthis fabric,” Balazs
said in an email.

“The—material would perform ‘these
‘sense, compute and respond’ functions
in a relatively autonomous manner, en-
abling it to operate without connections
to an external power supply.”

Balazs, whois a world expert on com-
puter modelingfof,     
tion, said this ‘work séeks tolacliiévé‘ tliese
objectives by investigating the coevolution
of energy-transducing soft materials such
as oscillating chemical gels and modes of
computation, which can exploit these ma-
terials’ characteristics. ‘

Balazs and Levitan have worked on

._projects together before, but this is their
biggest one yet. The next ﬁve years of the

Healthy U Fair demonstrates lifestyle, Wellness options

Cristina Holtzer
Staﬁ‘ Wrz'ter

Free condoms, food and puppy cuddles
could all be found at Wednesday morning’s
Healthy U fair.

Representatives from more than 15
health-conscious organizations, includ-
ing Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force and the
Western Pennsylvania Humane Society,
were stationed on the William Pitt Union
lawn for the fair, which took place between
10 a.m. and 2 p.m. and was hosted by the
Office of Student Affairs. ,

Healthy U is a campaign to encourage
college students at Pitt to integrate healthy
practices into their lives, and it encom-
passes many different groups both on and
off campus.

“There’s so much medical research that
really conﬁrms the link between being
healthy and well and having a successful
academic and college experience,” Healthy
U Director Marian Vanek said.

Representatives from Pitt Student

«s Health Services offered free ﬂu shots to ’

healthy students at the fair. Tracy Miljus,

clinic manager of Student Health Services’,
said her goal was “to get as many people
vaccinated with the ﬂu injection as [she]
possibly [could].” ‘

Last year, Vanek said that about 400 ﬂu
shots were administered, a goal Student
Health hoped to match this year. Vanek
said that about 2,000 students attended
the event throughout the day. _

“In order to keep our students healthy,
they need to start there ﬁrst,” Miljus said.

Tables for LA Fitness, Walk Pittsburgh
and Pitt Physical Therapy sought to teach
students about the importance of exercise
and physical activity in their lives. Healthy
U offered sign-ups for “ZooZilla,” a 5K race
at the Pittsburgh Zoo on Nov. 2.

Healthy U volunteers and students
agreed that other issues, such as exces-
sive drinking, also need to be addressed.
Sophomorejessica Graham said that health
issues are important to her because she is
a nursing student.

“Because we’re all college kids, there
are a lot of health issues,” Graham said.
“Like drinking.” C

“We’ve had students come up andask us
underage drinking questions,” McDaniel
said. “This alcohol chart has been a big hit.”

Pitt’s “Red Solo Cup” student organiza-
tion, which is dedicated to alcohol aware-
ness, distributed information regarding

/ underage drinking concerns on campus.

The group educates students of the conse-
quehces of breaking drug and alcohol laws.
Near the alcohol-awareness tables,
representatives from Pitt’s Sexual Assault
Services offered “The Dating Game,” which
prompted students to answer true—or-false
questions about dating violence and sexual
assault. Sexual Assault Services offers men-
tal health and legal counseling to students
and will be promoting domestic violence
education during Dating Violence Aware-
ness Week later this month. '
Some groups hoped to help students
with_stress relief, including the Resolve

Crisis Network in Point Breeze; Talk About '

It, which offers depression counseling ser-
vices to students, and the Humane Society,
which offers “puppy cuddles and laughs”
every Tuesday at 7 p.m. in the Cathedral

us,” he said.

Bradley delivered scientiﬁc evidence sup-
portingthe threat of global warming and pre-
sented graphs that charted the atmospheric
carbon dioxide at the National Oceanic and

- Atmospheric Administration observatoryin

Mauna Loa, Hawaii.
Bradley explained that humans are releas-
ing fossil fuels back into the atmosphere at a

rate much faster than it took those plants and ‘

animals to remove the carbon dioxide from
the atmosphere.

“We have a relentless rise in the level of
greenhouse gasses. That is the contribution
from the fossil fuel burning,” he said. “The
explosiveretum of carbon dioxide to the at-
mosphere is the ﬁmdamental problem that
we face.” ‘

Stricker said the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change’s ﬁfth assessment report
highlighted the severity of global wa‘rming’s
threat this past week.

This assessment is a revision of a report

that was previously issued by the panel, a
group of the world’s experts on the subject.

While the olderversion of the report noted
that it was very likely that anthropogenic fac-
tors are the main cause of greenhouse gas
emission, the updated report reads that it is
not only very likely, but extremely likely, that
human inﬂuence has been the dominant cause
of alterations to our climate.

Bradley said that the panel’s conclusions
have been supported and endorsed by every
major scientiﬁc organization. He then asked
the audience why the U.S. government failed
to take action. ‘

Bradley provided examples of various po-
litical ﬁgures whohave publicly denounced
the existence of global warming.

He noted that former Pennsylvania sena-
tor and presidential candidate Rick Santorum
said global warmingis an excuse forthe left to
increase government control and Paul Ryan,
R-Wis., said scientists are intentionally mis-
leading the public”

“They obviously haven’t read the last ﬁve
reports,” Bradley said.

Although Bradley drew on the example

i of Mauna Loa, he said that the same rise in

levels of carbon dioxide can be seen almost
anywhere on the planet.

In addition to the rise in carbon dioxide,
Bradley said that there has also been a rise in
temperatures over the last 130 years. These
rising temperatures are seen in both the at-
mosphere and the ocean.

Bradley said that while knowledge of
greenhouse gases’ radiative effect on the at-
mosphere has circulated for 200 years, more
recent technologies allow for computer mod-
els to more effectively observe changes an
createsimulations. .

He added that these computer models
have shown that polar ice has both receded
in area and thinned. Although the arctic has
a nearly nonexistent population, it serves
as a cooling mechanism for the rest of our
planet and is therefore an extremely relevant
problem.

Steven Turetsky, a senior economics and
biology major, said that he is concerned about
the future that awaits him.

“It’s important to be as informed and edu-
cated in the facts as possible, since we live in
abiased and media-driven society that tends
to mold our opinions for us,” he said. -‘

of Learning Commons Room through its
therapy dogs program. . Z

“I go home some weekends just to see
my animals,” Graham said. “Sometimes you
just need them.”

The fair included raffles for a Kindle
Fire, a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball bat and
other prizes.

Vanek and Miljus agreed that the main
cause of students’ aversion to healthy life-
styles is the stress from trying to balance

, school with other obligations and a social

life. .
“They’ve got a lot on their plates with

school and activities,” Miljus said. “I would ’

say take time for yourself to decrease your
stress, and stay in a stress-free zone.” -3

grant will consist of developing several
different models that will change in accu-
racy over time. Levitan said that if they get
experimentalists to help and give feedback,
it could move faster. '

The type of computing isn’t number-
crunching, it’s recognizing patterns or do-
ing things such as measuring heartbeat and
carrying out an interaction that’s based on
some sensory response.

“And then maybe, eventually, people
could use that where the computing would
get some sensory data like temperature
of skin or movement or maybe pressure-
sensitive like a ﬁngerprint recognizer,”
Levitan said.

. In terms of its tentative image when

developed, it would look like a fabric that «

could be worn as ajacket with a thin, multi-
layered jello-like_ sheet and a wire mesh—like
netting with the addition of other electron-
ics, such as nodes and buttons, connected
to it.

Levitan hopes that his project with Bala-
zs will spark interest in future endeavors
that will combine their two ﬁelds.

“What’s exciting to me is not so much
what we’re going to do but maybe inspiring
other groups to also look at this notion of
using chemistry and computing together,
and that’s sort of the overriding idea,”
Levitan said. -i

COLUMN

Columnist

 
   
  
  
 
  
  
  
 

One month ago, Mary Margaret
Vojtko would have been the last per-
 son anyone would expect to become
an online icon. ‘

' But the tragic death of the
83-year-old French professor at
Duquesne University has reverber-
, ated throughout popular media out-
lets as an alarm to the disgraceﬁil
conditions in.which many non-ten-
- ured adjunct professors now work
within contemporary universities.

The passing ofVotjko after a ma-
jor heart attack would have gone
unnoticed had it not been for an
editorial published two weeks ago
in the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette by
‘ one of her associates. The author,

an attorney representing the Unit-
if ed Steelworkers Union, lambasted
Duquesne for its alleged mistreat-
ment of Vojtko throughout her ca-
reer at the institution.

After paying her under $3,500
per class and providing no health
beneﬁts, the university dismissed
' her — after 25 years of service —
with no severance.

After the. story received 65,000
shares on Facebook and nearly
4,000 tweets, it wasn’t just Pitts-
burgh that shared in this outrage.

This characterization of the be-
leaguered professor is not, however,
unique to Vojtko or to Duquesne.
Though her story proves particu-
larly tragic, it is one not unknown to
the non-tenured adjuncts who now
compose the majority of university
instructors across the country.

Minimal pay, semester.-long
contracts, and nonexistent beneﬁts
accurately describe the lifestyle of
most non-tenured instructors. The

$3,500 that Vojtko received actu-
ally exceeds the national average for
adjuncts at private and public uni-
versities, which stagnates around
$3,000 per class.

The tired stereotype of the over-
paid and under—worked university
professor, reaping the beneﬁts of
tenure, no longer applies to the
current academic workforce. Only
30 percent of university faculty is
considered “tenure-track,” that is,
currently holding tenure or a posi-
tion that will allow them to achieve
tenure in the near future. Being in
the tenure track is usually charac-
terized by institutional support to
conduct research and publish.

The minority of professors who
beneﬁt from this elevatedposition
on the academic hierarchy enjoy
disproportionately larger salaries
than their non-tenured colleagues.
For example, the average tenured
professor at Pitt is compensated

with a $135,900 salary. Compare —

that to the average $3,200 "that
part-time faculty receive for each
3—credit class. ii
That means that an adjunct
would have to teach 42 classes per
year to receive the compensation of
his or her tenured colleagues 4 and
that’s not including health or dental
beneﬁts. '
Unfortunately, no one is more

familiar with these discrepancies
' than university administrators, who

often consider adjunct faculty con-

venient alternatives to costly profes- L-

sors when ﬁnancial times get tough.
What is more, their brief contracts
give departments the ﬂexibility to
contract budgets in a climate of
uncertain state appropriations and
tuition revenue.

The changing demographics of

Universities must pay adjunct
lecturerstheir fair share

the academic job market will require
new organizations to advocate on
behalf of not only the marginalized
non-tenured population, but also
the shortchanged students they
teach until they’ve reached the point
of exhaustion.

And just like so many profes-
sional groups before them, these
faculty, students and administrators
must realize the institution best ca-
pable of enacting these results: the
labor union. V V

As non-tenured faculty expand
their share of the labor force, many
are increasingly organizing into
their own or existing labor unions,
such as the Service Employee Indus-
trial Union, the American Federa-
tion of Teachers and the National
Education Association.

In Pittsburgh, the ‘effort has been
championed by the United Steel-
workers Union, who have been
working to organize professors at
Duquesne University for several
months. In June 2012, the profes-
sors in Duquesne’s McAnulty Col-
lege and Graduate School of Liberal
Arts voted successfully to organize
part-time faculty within the United
Steelworkers.

Duquesne, however, disputes the
move to unionize among its instruc-
tors. It claims that as a religious in-
stitution affiliated with the Catholic
Church, it oughtbe exempt from the
National Labor Relations Board’s re-
quirement that employers recognize
their employees’ right to organize.

Such an irrelevant claim is an
insult not only to the memory of V0-
jtko, but to the entire U.S. Catholic

‘ community, which has historically

defended the rights of poor and

marginalized workers.

The adjuncts who rely on their currently
meager compensation require better con-
tracts and a level of dignity —— not charity
— from their employers. -

By reﬁising instructors the ability to col-
lectively bargain for more secure contracts
and reasonable compensation, institutions
like Duquesne do disservice to their em-
ployees and their students alike. Beyond
denying their instructors the basic right to
organize, they also deny their student body

the opportunity to develop lasting relation— I

ships with committed faculty members in
unsecured positions. When adjuncts — who
work on brief, unreliable contracts — com-
pose a pronounced majority of instructors,
it will only become more difficult for stu-
dents to develop meaningful relationships
with professors. It requires professors who
have the security to invest in a university
community to develop such an atmosphere.
But ﬁrst, -it will require the universities to
invest in the professors. I

LETTER To THE EDITOR

To the Editor:

Thanks for the detailed coverage of
Agibail Salisbury’s lecture last week
about her experiences in Ethiopia. I
wanted to clarify my comments about
the ban on Skype in Ethiopia in your
Sept. 26 article “Ethiopia bans access
to student’s critical article.” Many,
including myself, first thought that
these actions were targeting freedom
of speech, but that was not the full story.
On May 24, 2012, Ato Shimelis Kemal,
the Ethiopian minister of state at the
Government Communications Affairs
Office,~clarified that “the use of VoIP,
including Skype and Google Talk and
similar services was not banned and
that the proposed“law was aimed at con-

trolling service providers that operate ,

illegally to generate revenues through

_these services.”

The digital revolution is exploding
in Africa, as it did 15 years ago in the
U.S. African governments are trying
to adapt to a new cyber context where
outdated laws do not reﬂect current
realities. How does a government regu-
late an entity, like the Internet, that
knows no sovereign border? As recent
NSA revelations have shown, our own
country is also trying to come to grasp
how to respect our Constitution but
also keep the nation safe from terror-
ists. And like in the U.S., countries like
Ethiopia are quickly trying to create a‘
legal framework for this new digital age.
In countries where the government has
held a traditional monopoly on telecom— I
munications and IT infrastructure, the
Internet is uncharted territory.

Sincerely,

MUSIC REVIEW

On Old, Danny B

John Lavanga

Danny»Brown

Grade: B+
Sounds Like:
A Dannly Browln
Album. Period.

After nearly a decade of ﬁghting to
dig his way out of a life of crime and
musical anonymity in the apocalyp-
tic wasteland that is post-industrial
Detroit, Danny Brown, also known
as “The Hybrid,” ﬁnally got a late
taste of good luck when his 2011 LP

'XXX became one of the mostwidely

praised albums of the year. By ap-
pealing to hedonistic revelers and

academic hip-hop geeks alike with

Danny Brown peers into the abyss over immaculate beats on Old.

its wide range of tracks, the album
showcased Brown’s singularity in
hip-hop and undeniable versatility.
With the release of Old on Monday,
Brown showed the music world that
X)O( was just a teaser of what The

Hybridhasgotplannedforhip-hop. '

What has set Danny Brown

' apart recently —has?been the dual

nature of his most recent albums.

' On one track, he’ll drop verse af-

ter borderline-pomographic verse
about his sexual exploits and drug-
fueled depravity, all delivered in a
strangely nasally voice over an ad-
dictive, pounding, club—ready beat.

On the next he’ll revert to painfully

_ honest tones over a laid-back beat

as he tells heart—rending stories
aboutwalking between burned—out
vacant lots in the Detroit suburbs.
If it sounds like a toughact-to. bal-
ance, thatsbecause it is, but Brown

- manages to pull_ it pffinlan impres-

sive fashion. It’s forthis reason that
he’s become known as The Hybrid.
.Fans of the banger—driven

surprised by Old.’s emotional ﬁrst
half. While his previous releases

to the fun:.St,uﬂ°- = c -
Beginningewith the opening

track “SideA(Old),” Brown spends

10 tracks exploring his emotional

‘instability, childhood poverty and

life as a drug dealer. Whether it’s

because of Detroit’s current des- R

peration or simply Brown’s inter-

‘ est in having his struggles taken

rown injects some reality into his revelry

seriously, the decision to frontload
the album’s heavy stuff works bril-
liantly. Each track on the album’s
ﬁrst half contains immaculate pro-
duction with an incredible range,
best exempliﬁed by the surpris-
ingly well-executed switch from the
old-scho ol instrumental sampling
on “The Return” to S‘25 Bucks,” a

- palpably modern track featuring

Purity Ring.

production sometimes distracts
from the tragedy of the verses —

beats on “Dope Fiend Rental” —

on “Gremlins,” as he reminisces on

these verses so effective is the neu-
tral tone he strikes on the tracls.

FILM_ REVIEW

‘Gravity’ a visually arresting, tastefully executed thriller

' Shawn Cooke
For The Pitt News

“Life in space is impossible.”

The opening text fromAlfonso
Cuaron’s “Gravity” reads like an
understatement of the highest de-
gree after enduring the harrowing
tale of survival that follows. But
ﬁlming this spellbinding visual
spectacle may have been just as
impossible. '

“Gravity” opens with an as-
tonishing 13-minute-long shot of
Earth, with a tiny speck of space-
craft slowly emerging into the fore-
ground. Astronaut Matt Kowalsky

“Gravity”
Directed by:
‘Alfonso Cuaron
Starring‘: Sandra
Bullock, George
Clooney
Grade: B+

(George Clooney) wisecracks with
ﬁrst—time space explorer Ryan
Stone (Sandra Bullock) while she’s
ﬁxing a problem outside of their
space shuttle. It’s just another day
at the oﬂice, until predictably, di-
saster strikes: Debris from a de-
stroyed satellite rips toward them,
obliterating the ship.

Aftertheir tether breaks, Stone
is swallowed into space, ﬂoating
aimlessly around with a dwindling
oxygen supply. Reliant only on
Kowalsky’s voice over the radio,
Stone’s hopes of returning home
diminish by the second.

Anybody who shudders at the

thought of watching Bullock ﬂoat

in space for 90 minutes can rest‘

easy: There’s a whole lot more to
“Gravity” than the trailers sug-
gest. Asfar as survival ﬁlms go,
it bears more of a resemblance
to the visceral horror of “Alien”
than the contemplative isolation of
“127 Hours.” Viewers are spared a

-full—length ﬁlm that is a collection

of Sandra Bullock retrospectives
(though that might make an ef-
fective horror ﬁlm in itself), and
instead the ﬁlm becomes a race
against time where hope seems
all but lost and panic increases as
oxygen levels drop. Above all else,

director Alfonso Cuaron seems to
be concerned with crafting an un-
conventional modern visual feast.

With many of the ﬁlm’s best
shots ripped straight from the
pages of Stanley Kubrick, it’s no
secret which science—ﬁction classic
Cuaron strives to emulate and up-
date for the 21st century. If “2001:
A Space Odyssey” represents the
groundbreaking beginnings of
effects- driven cinema, then “Grav-
ity” represents its ﬁiture. Each
breathtaking image seamlessly
blends CGI and live-action to the

point where discerning one from the other
is impossible.

It’s astonishing how far CGI effects have
come since their early days, but it’s stillan
effect that can be nauseatingly overused to
the point where CGI is sometimes a stand—in
for actual plot. However, Cuaron manages
to utilize high-quality effects in a way that
tastefully enhances the plot. Even if a ma-
jority of the ﬁlm is computer—generated, it
looks and feels so bracingly realistic that it
never distracts.

Following an exhausting and noisy sum-
mer of superheroes, robots and reboots,
“Gravity” feels refreshingly quaint. Compar-
ing his ﬁlm to friend Guillermo del Toro’s
“Paciﬁc Rim,” Cuaron stated that “Gravity”
felt “like a tiny Sundance ﬁlm.” Its reported
$80 million budget seems stunningly mod-
est for a ﬁlm that looks this good. However,
even if it gives the conventional blockbuster
a necessary shot in the arm, it’s still bogged
down by some narrative missteps.

One of the ﬁlm’s strongest elements and
liabilities is the breakneck pacing and com-

Q FROM PAGE 7

OLD

Sheldon Satenstein | Assistant Visual Editor
makes the album’s A side so refreshingly
 ~

As great as the album’s ﬁrst half is, how-
ever, the second half is just as strong. The
album’s second—half opener, “Side B (Dope
Song)” raises the bar and starts to delve into
the side of Danny Brown that draws the mobs
at music festivals. Over a relentless, explosive
beat concocted by talented Scottish producer
Rustie, Brown declares that “this is my last
song/ not my last dope song/ but my last dope
song,’.’ meaning he’s going to focus on his
current life from here on out.

The juxtaposition of the dark content of
this track with the dance beat is shocking; On
the second verse, anAlvin—the— Chipmunk-like
voice joins Brown to rap about “Crackhead
Lisa, she used to be ﬁt/ had sex with a trick,
and now she sick.” Itbecomes clear that even
if the overt social commentary is over, the
dark undertones aren’t about to end.

From there, the album becomes a collec-
tion of heavy, relentlessly catchy beats that
Brown goes in on without hesitation. Brown
gets into the zone on “Dip,” beginning with
a spot—on Forrest Gump reference. “Like Lt.
Dan I’m rolling,” he deadpans, before going
offaboutaborderline disastrous benderwith
lines like “And I keep feelin’ like I’m gon’ faint/
But f"‘ck that n*gga, pass me that drank.”. l

It’s the reality on these tracks that elevates

anny Brown performed at Air Bar in the Strip District his past Thursday.

October 3, 2018 I The Pitt News 1 vvvvw.pittnevvs.com

the second half of Old from a collection of
party tracks to somethingfar more substan-
tive. Brown manages to look at his own escap-
ist tendencies and the blatant nihilism of the
modern drug scene without falling into the
trap of preaching or glorifying what’s happen—
ing. The fact that listeners get to absorb these
disarming exposés of Brown’s own cynicism
and insecurity wrapped up in tracks produced
by top—notch producers like A—Trak, Rustie,
Darq E Freaker and SKYWLKR only enhances
the strength of his observations,

Make no mistake: Old, like all of Danny
Brown’s music, rises and falls on its produc
tion. Brown is a veritable chameleon across
tr"acks,»ﬁtting his style to whatever he’s got
to work with. On Old, he used his newfound
notoriety to assemble some of the best, most
innovative producers in the game to give him
tracks that would sound amazing without a
single verse uttered. _ A

If any issues do exist on the album, it’s
that Brown, though versatile, isn’t always the
most eloquent of rappers. Much of his ﬂow
is forgettable, and even his strongest verses
probably won’t be upheld as high art. He re-
peats the same stories on multiple tracks, and
rhymes words with themselves a little too
often. So perhaps it’s not a timeless classic,
but Old is unquestionably a smart, perfectly
produced and incredibly catchy album. I

OBSERVATORY

community outreach. Since May 19, Un-
daunted has been offered by American
Public Television to over 350 public televi-

sion stations across the country. This has '

brought great exposure to the observatory,
which provides numerous research oppor-
tunities for Pitt students. In September,
the Carnegie Science Center showed the
ﬁlm for the ﬁrst time in the Buhl Planetar-
ium. Screenings of the ﬁlm will occur on
the ﬁrst Saturday of each month at 6 p.m.

Last February, the Science Center
brought Handley in for a Cafe Scientiﬁque
event, which included a screening of the
movie and a follow—up Q—and—A session.
According to Robert Marshall, program
developmenticoordinator for the plan-

A etarium, that night was the best—attended

Café Scientiﬁque event the Science Center
has ever seen. , ' A

L “People have called since then asking
when it’s going to play again, so we know
that the public is generally interested in
it. So we wanted to provide a permanent
venue for the ﬁlm,” Marshall said.

The present building, known as the
Allegheny Observatory, has stood for a
hundred years in Riverview Park. Prior
to this, the observatory was located on
Pittsburgh’s North Side. “The observatory
is now more of a museum than a research
facility,” said David Turnshek, professor
of astrophysics and cosmology at Pitt and

_ the current directorof the Observatory.

This wasn’t always the case, however.
In the ’80s and ’90s, when George Gate-
wood was director, the observatory was
one of the major centers of astrometry:
the branch of astronomy that seeks to
measure the positions and movements of
celestial bodies, This process was abetted
by the Thaw Telescope.

“In fact-, until 1990, [Thaw was] the
most successful telescope in the world
for measuring distances to nearby stars,”
Turnshek said. The Allegheny Observafory
was also instrumental in the discovery of
exoplanets, or planets that lie just outside
the solar system. Pluto is now regarded as
an exoplanet. '

Astrometry isn’t the observ_atory’s
only claim to fame. Handley has also
undertaken the daunting duty of expos-
ing the work of a few forgotten giants. In
“Undaunted,” he highlights the scientiﬁc

breakthroughs of two men: Samuel Lang-
ley and John Brashear.

To a native Pittsburgher, the names
Langley and Brashear should be familiar.
Two city schools bear the name: Brashear

as a high school, Langley now as a grade ,

school and also as a building on Pitt_’s cam-
pus.-It'"is fairly unlikely, however, that the
average Pittsburgher is well—versed in the

, gigantic contributions these two men have

made to science and world history.

Thfehwright Brothers will always be
remembered as the fathers of aviation.
Wilbur and Orville, however, werén’t the
ones to discover the physical rules of
mechanical ﬂight and write them down.
Langley worked out equations dealing
with physical properties of air currents
and the power required for ﬂight. Without
this groundbreaking work, it would have
been impossible to designairplanes. ‘All
[Langley’s] research and his textbook on
ﬂight happened at the original observatory
here in Pittsburgh,” Handley said.

Langley greatly improved the observa- .

toryis capabilities when he became its ﬁrst
academic director in 1867. He installed
a small transit telescope that was used
to observe the positions of stars as they
cross the celestial meridian, or the point in
the sky directly above an observer. Using
astronomical observations made at the
observatory, Langley also devised a new
time standard to facilitate coordination
on the country’s railroads. This was the
beginning of the system of time zones we
know today. 5
Langley was also one of the ﬁrst to ﬂy a
mechanical ﬂying machine. An air drone
he designed is on display-in Posvar Hall.
“Langley was always thinking scientiﬁcal-
ly, [inventing] new approaches to things
that other people hadn’t thought of before.
He did that with astrophysics, and he did
that with aviation,” Handley said.
Brashear, the second forgotten giant,

was indispensable in Einstein’s develop— ~

ment of the Theory of Relativity.
“If Langley was sort of the genius inven-

tor, or the conceiver of ideas, Brashear was ‘

the implementer, the master instrument
maker,” Handley said. While working as a
millwright in Pittsburgh, Brashear looked
for a better way to pursue his love of as-
tronomy at night. Being too poor to pur-
chase a telescope, he built his.own work-

shop, and eventually his own refractor.

Several years later, he was working
full time designing scientiﬁc instruments,
including telescopes, a profession that
gradually gained him wo rldwide respect.
In 1898, he became director of the ob-
servatory, only to leave his post in 1900
to ‘serve as acting chancellor at Western
University of Pennsylvania, now known
as the University of Pittsburgh.

“It’s an inspirational story, in a sense,
of someone who just wanted to do some-
thing so badly to understand astronomy,
that he just did everything himself. But in
the process he ended up learning how to

be a master instrument maker,” Handley -

said.

In fact, Brashear’s optical instruments
were so precise that they were sought
after in the famous Michaelson—Morley
experiment. The experiment, which is
often considered a starting point for the
second scientiﬁc revolution, attempted

Confusion
surrounds
‘hardship’

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staff Wrz'ter

When Long Island, N.Y., native _].J. Moore
signed his national letter of intent to play
college basketball at Pitt, Panthers fans saw
the 6-foot-6 forward as an interesting gamble.

Moore’s bullish physique and his ability to

jump made Pitt’s most analytic fans wonder

if he would ﬁnd a role in head coach Jamie

Dixon’s ﬁindamentally sound motion offense.
' , Moore never did after three years.

Alter a junior season in which he came off
the bench andwas given less playingtime than
in his sophomore season, Moore decided to
transfer to a school that would be able to ac-
commodate his unorthodox style of play. That
school was Rutgers, which is knee—deep in a
rebuilding process after the hiring and ﬁring
of former Head Coach Mike Rice.

Over the weekend, Moore appealed to the
NCAA for immediate eligibility at Rutgers by
way of a legislative relief waiver, commonly
referred to as a “hardship waiver.” Hardship
waivers are last—resort appeals for players
wishing to be excused from NCAA transfer
rules because 0 “extraordinary orextenuaﬁng
circumstances warran .”

But let’s be honest here: Moore isn’t facing
any hardships. -

Under NCAA rules, all transfers must sit
out one season before they are permitted to
play for their new team.

Moore pleaded family—re1ated reasons for
his appeal, claiming that Rutgers provided
necessary accessibility to his wife, daughter
and grandfather. According to Facebook, how-

ever, his wife and daughter live in New York.
For those of you whorelentlessly speak out
against the NCAA, pay close attention:
Months before Moore’s appeal, fellow
Rutgers transfer Kerwin Okoro, who spent
his freshman year at Iowa State, desired im-

The ACC hasn’t witnessed many surprises

and Florida State — haven’t slowed down
at all. .

Soon, the top teams will begin to meet
on the ﬁeld, and we’ll begin to watch some

. Until then, it seems as though all but one
or two of the remair1ingACC schools are ﬁght-_
ing just to rank in the top half of the conferf
ence. Expect to see the breakdown drastically
change once the teams ﬁnd themselves in the
heart of conference play. :

Here’s this weel€s ACC Breakdown:

Clemson 1

Tom Savage was sacked seven times, but Pitt managed to r

inthe state of Florida. The Hurricanes will take
on Florida State later this" season, after beat-
ing the Seminoles in a previous game; For the
second-straight week, quarterback Stephen
Morris leftthe game with an ankle injury, but
he is expected to be healthy for this weekend.

Florida State

Boston College, not known for its offensive
prowess, found some ﬂaws in the Seminoles’
defense. The Eagles racked up 397 yards with
a balanced attack, but it wasn’t enough to stop

Jameis Winston from leading his FSU offense A

to the 48-34 victory.

Maryland A

The Terrapins had a bye week, but that
didn’t stop them from jumping into the AP
poll at No. 25. Maryland’s 37-0 win over West
Virginia looks alotbetterto voters afterWVU’s
upset of No. 11 Oklahoma State this pastweek—

knock of Florida State thislweek.

doesn’t say much for the conference. They’ve~

‘struggled this year_with less—than—stellar

Pitt

Pitt’s 14-3 win over Virginia wasn’t pretty.
The Panthers were aided by dropped balls,

' NFL should give up on efforts to expand overseas

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

I didn’t watch this past Sunday’s game be-
tween the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Min-
nesota Vikings.

It wasn’t because I was frustrated with
Todd Haley’s offense or because itwas a mean-
ingless matchup that likely means more to
draft stock than it will impact the playoffs.

My reasoning is because the National

Football League had the teams play in Lon-

don, England._

The NFL’s “Intemational Series” has
had eight games in total so far — another
is scheduled in late October — with seven
of those eight taking place in London. The
non-London game was in Mexico City.

Afrequentargumentisthatthe four major
American sports — football, baseball, hockey
and basketball — are competingto be the ﬁrst
to expand overseas and have a team in Europe.

The MLB, NHL and NBA have all held
games overseas. All three have a signiﬁcant
amount of foreign players and are playing

international games in countries that have
leagues of their own.

It’s a different animal for those leagues,
though. When the NFL does it, it just feels
like shoving a square peg into a round hole.

First, why should Americans send their
premier sport overseas to afcountry that
doesn’t appreciate it? In the past, the English
fans have done the wave, cheered after every
play and made'nofis‘e when “their” team is on
offense, unaware of the game’s rules. And it’s
not like Britain has attempted to accommo-
date.American soccer fans. Despite a much
better American following for the Barclays
Premier League than the NFL has among the
British, the United Kingdomhas never senta
re -season matchtothe United States, let
alone one consisting of the league’s premier

*' teams.

Sending B-squads to play exhibition games
against Major League Soccer teams doesn’t
count. If the NFL is going to continue send-

ging important games across the pond, then

the Premier League should have to respond
accordingly. » f“

The Steelers’ owners, the Rooney family,
were excited to play a game in London.

I applaud the Steelers for not taking a
home game away from Heinz Field. Last
week’s game in London counted as a home
game for the Vikings, and the Steelers will
still play eight regular-season games at Heinz
Field. , ‘ ‘

Steelers fans in Minnesota might not agree

. with me. The last time the Steelers played in

Minnesota was 2005, and the Metrodome
was packed with Steelers fans.
Vikings season-ticket holders are upset

, about losing a game from their home sched-
' ule, and Minnesota—based Steelers fans who

get to see’ their team every eight years weren’t
too happy, either. '

To ﬁnd an international market that the
Steelers, and the NFL, should be looking to
play in, we just need to go south of the border.

The seventh—largest city in the world,
Mexico City, already has an NFL fan base
and one that is listed on the Steelers’ radio
afﬁliates’ website.

Ifthe Steelers take the time to make Span-

ish radio broadcasts available for Mexican
fans, then perhapsﬁthey should be looking to
reward those fans with a game.

' One game was played in Mexico City in
2005 between the Arizona Cardinals and San
Francisco 49ers. It drew over 100,000 fans.

So while the much-maligned NFL commis-
sioner will continue to try to force American
football down the throats of the British, a
devoted fan base will continue to be ignored.

Forget the Mexican fan base. Forget that
Mexico City is in the same time zone as nine
NFL teams. And forget that it’s the seventh-
largest city.

Just look at what NFL Europe, anAmerican
football league in Europe from 1991 to 2007,
did. League average attendance per game was
never more than 26,000. Roger Goodell said
the league lost $30 million a year.

The NFL Europe team in London, the Lon-
don Monarchs, lasted from 1991 to 1998. It
was the ﬁrst team to fold from the league.

Perhaps Goodell just needs to look to the
past to realize that London isn’t the place for
his type of football. 3

is a tough team to read, as it has only faced
Clemson in conference play. This week, the
Pack takes on Wake Forest.
North Carolina

‘After an embarrassing 55-3,1-loss against
East Carolina, the Tar Heels look like a com-
pletely different team than the one that ap-
peared a contender for the conference crown

at the start of this season. UNC is one of the
worst teams in the country at running the

ball, and-along with its one-dimensional of--

fense, the Tar Heels defense has struggled all
season long. ‘

Virginia I ‘

If the Cavaliers can ﬁgure anything out on
offense, they’ll win some games. In a lifeless
offensive performance, Virginia had 188yards
and scored three points against Pitt, giving
the Panthers all their points on turnovers.
Defensively, this team deserves a better rank-

' ing than 10th.

Syracuse‘
Don’t be surprised if ‘Cuse starts winning

some games now that they have found a quar-
terback. Since taking over, Terrel Hunt has
completed 33 of43 passes for468 yards, seven
touchdowns and zero interceptions.

Boston College A

The Eagles got a good loss this weekend
against Florida State. Boston College led 17-3
in the second quarter and stayed within two
scores of the talented Seminoles most of the
game. Take away their two turnovers and the
Eagles might have upset FSU.

Duke .

The Blue Devils’ 38-31 victory over Troy
University isn’t going to convince anyone that
the football team in Durham has much worth.

‘ Duke’s quick-strike offense isn’t helping its

defense, as the team often ﬁnds itself on the
lower end of time of possession. *

Wake Forest

Clemson made the Demon Deacons look
like a Football Championship Series school.
Offensively, Wake Forest couldn’t move the
ball and turned it over twice. Defensively, the
Demon Deacons didn’t look much better; as
they were down 21 points in the ﬁrst eight
minutes of the game!

mediate eligibility, as well.

Unlike Moore, Okoro’s 72-year-old father
died of a stroke in2o12. Less than ayear later,
his 28-year-old brother also tragically passed
away as a result of colon cancer.

Following the chain of ﬁmeral processions
and his freshman season in the Midwest,

Okoro desired to move closer to his family,»

who live in Bronx, N.Y. He chose Rutgers and
appealed to the NCAA for a hardship waiver
in'August.

He was denied awaiver and is now forced
to sit out a season.

Clearly, there was a hardship involved in
Okoro’s situation.

The list continues in a less dramatic fash-

M ion: Former Pitt guard Trey Zeiglerwas cleared »

by the NCAA for immediate eligibility with a
hardship waiver after transferring from Cen-
tral Michigan. The N CAA’s reason: His dad was
ﬁred as coach at Central Michigan.

Everyone’s alive.’

Brooklyn native, Rutgers transfer and
current Pitt junior Derrick Randall was also
granted immediate eligibility after request-
ing a waiver. The NCAA’s reason: His former
coach threw basketballs and swore at players.

Everyone’s alive.
I know virtually nothing aboutJ.J. Moore’s

, personal life, butI do know enough to saythat

all signs point to his transfer being purely a
basketball move. -
Last winter, Moore and his wife, Kristina
Matos, openly expressed their distaste for
Jamie Dixon over Twitter. Following the 2012
season, Dixonwas reportedly “trying to help

[Moore] ﬁnd a school” and “trying to help '

him ﬁnd the right place,” but that’s beside the
point. In Moore’s three years at Pitt, I did not
see him or his wife ‘openly expressing concern
to move closer to home.

Moreover (no pun intended), Moore’s In-
stagram name is nbabound44moore. Let’s be
honest, though: Unless he is magically granted
four more years of collegiate basketball very

soon, ‘Moore will not be playing basketball‘

foraliving.  .

T He would do nothingbut beneﬁt from sit-
ting out a year at Rutgers. If his development
is slowed down a year, he could even have a
shot at playing overseas.

The bizarre situation seems to create a
seesaw effect between players with person-

i al problems and players who wish to gain

starting spots on teams by switching to new
schools, and the players with the bona ﬁde
personal problems seem to be left in the dark.
