He also suggested the group

Rhodes discussedta child abuse

the State “takes, custody of

The Representative also dis-
cussed a bill to be introduced in the
House establishing a society for the
prevention of cruelty to children.

Rhodes said,“Children in Penn-
sylvania are seriously under-
immunized” against dyptheria,
whooping’ cough, polio, measles
and rubella. He ‘outlined three
current bills, 1362, 64, and 65
which would establish criminal
offenses for failure to immunize

Rhodes attacked the juvenile
code because “it detains and
institutionalizes _too many child-

“ineffective.” He also pointed out
that Juvenile Detention Centers are
“totally segregated,” and- further
“I ' don’t believe 1 in

' “Titicut Follies’ ’.

Thomas explained the signiﬁ-
cance of the ﬁlm’s title: “An
Indian tribe under the leadership of
Chief Titicut once lived on the
hospital's site. Each year four grim
patients ‘whoop it up? in a show
they call ‘Titicut Follies’ to
entertain the other patients. A

“Wiseman, an attorney, went to
the hospital by invitation of ti;-R,
superintendent who wanted the"
problems that existed made
known,” Thomas said, “Thefilm is
really a collage of brief scenes
tracing the life of a patient from his
admittance to- release. In. a
progressive style, it shows the
aging and deterioration. It’s a
tragic portrayal which now seems
so commonplace.”

Thomas is primarily concerned
with the ﬁlm's effect. Hefeels the
ﬁlm's most important contribution,
apart from its artistic merit, is its
role in the civil rights movement in
the areas of mental health and
retardation.

“Because of this ﬁlm,
Massachusetts Bar Association
developed a tremendous number of
new procedures to be used in the
state’s institutions and it has set
the pace for others across. the 1‘-;
country,” Thomas emphasized.

He pointed out that, after

“The Massachusetts Bar Assoc-

and because of this film there are
now new protective laws. It really
shows what a breakthrough a
courageous producer made?” 3
Thomas concluded. Ii
Wodnicki, concentrating more on
the content ofthe ﬁlm, talked about . ’,
how the people working at the
hospital‘ accepted their roles. ,
He stated, “The tragic thing is ii
that their own perception 
themselves was a favorable one“"“
they had never questioned.

He concluded, “I don’t thinkithat

but it will dramatize the co_nditi’on
and, in that sense, make a
contribution. ' ’ . .

abandoned any hope of recapturing

Answer: I don't think that this is
the case at all...It isn't clear to me
whetliei‘ this has been interpreted
’as_a prediction or a commitment of
our purposes. It is true that we
have abandoned the Bal-lev Line
and established a new line three or
four miles east of it, east of the
water_line. I would not consider this

should deal with predictions. Israel
is fighting 8"W211‘. a very serious
war. and we are coping.

Q: If either Egypt or "Syria
successfully recaptured territories
lost in 1967, would Israel be open to
a cease fire?

A: I don't want to play any,
simulation games. I would rather
not enter into any predictions at
this time.

Q: Under what conditions would
you expect the U.S. to actively
intervene on a military basis? '
A: Under no conditions whatso-

Q: Have you seen any sign of
dwindling support due to the oil
situation from the United States or
Western European governments?
A: In my opinion. there is not. The
oil is another matter completely.
Q: According to the Syrian
Government, there are no military
installations in Damascus. 'Why
then have the Israelis bombed the
Syrian capital?

A: First of all. my friend, I want to
tell you that there are military
installations within Damascus.
Also. we did not attack Syria. Syria
attacked us. War is a tragedy. a
tragedy for all sides concerned.
Our citizens are being shelled with
Syrian gound—to-ground missiles as
well.

Q: There is a report that the Soviet
Union warned Israel through a
French intemediary of the planned

.Arab invasion at least three days in

/advance. This report has been
confirmed by the Kremlin, and

Jerusalem now indicates that they.

were not surprised by the attack. Is .

that true?

A: That is correct. The Soviets
informed our government Friday at
midnight that war is imminent. We
had 14 hours notice. Their
statement was ‘war is imminent.’
Q: Why then didn't Israel seizethe
offensive?

A: This is a good question. Our
major effort in those 14 hours was
to acheive imaximum support from
all sides. and mobilize our forces.
We tried to avoid war through
diplomatic means. It was a
calculated risk. as every risk of this
kind is; it was a very painful
decision.

I Dear Editor: _

4 I " ‘The ‘significance of the Persian/
‘Arab Gulf area, economically and
"thence politically, has hardly been
brought to public attention with
- due emphasis, We are talking.

‘ . about an area that holds about 2/3

already supplies about 70% of

Interior Secretary Morton, the U.S.
is going to import 65% of its oil
supply, primarily from the Persian
Gulf. Naturally, a rejoin of such
vital ‘economic importance has to be
carefully guarded by or on behalf of _
the oil barons, whose superproﬁts
\ ‘ depend on their monopoly control‘
ﬁe over, production,’ marketing and

, agpdistribution of this oil all over the

. is .unbearable, the oil barons. say,,

and has to be avoided or turned.
around at all costs. , '
»A direct’ military intervention or
even presence is unpopular,
especially after the Vietnam
experience. It has to be left as a
last resort. An apparently viable
alternative would _be to prop local,
corrupt; dictatorial puppet regimes
in the area, arm them to the teeth,
against their own people, and let
them be the watchdog of multi-.'
national oil company‘ interests.
Examples are numerous: Iran,
Saudi Arabia, Kwait, Oman....L‘
Such schemes also help" ‘U.S.
partially offset its international
balance of payments; deﬁcit by
retrieving the dollars that were
paid for oil through sale, of U.S.

‘arms to the governments of these ‘

oil producing‘ countries. A’
prominent recent example is the $3
billion arms deal with Iran, the
biggest single deal in Peiitagon’s
entire history_. , . I ~

But what if such schemes do not
workin the long run? What'if the
popular liberation movements: in
the region gain strength and pose a
serious threat to the local puppets
and eventually to the monopoly
iiiterests in.the area? Well, then
there is no choice» but direct »
intervention, as it has happened in
Vietnam and so many other places»
so far. . If such an ‘eventuality’
should arise due to the growing ‘
strength of the ‘national _liberation
movements, andthere are indica-
:tions' that this may be the case‘ in‘
the ‘not-too-distant‘ future, how

could such an intervention. be I

popularized in this country, or at
least condoned by- the people?
Well, the solution has recently
been found, and it lies in the fraud
of the so-called “energy crisis”.
The oil barons hope to succeed,
through their government and their
media,in “convincing” the people,’

"by sabotaging production, raising‘ ~

prices,‘-and creating artificial"
shortages, that the flow of oil (what.
they really mean is the flow of their
superprofits) must remain un-
impeded-even at the cost of getting
involved in ‘another Vietnam. If
these unprincipledprascals do
succeed in making people feel the
“problem” (with their scare tactics
and through creating all kinds of’
artificial shortages[ then, ‘pre-
sumably, a large part of 'the
population, out of, sheer political

standing of the real issues
involved, /may in (fact buy such,

BY JOHN METCALFE _

One fo the local responses to the current war in the
Middle East hasfbeen a campaign to collect both
money and blood to aid the combatants. The most
conspicuous campaign has been on behalf of Israel. :
Most of the response has been positive; more blood
-donors showed up than’ could be accommodated. and
a lot'of money (ﬁgures vary) has been given.

There have been negative reactions. People and
groups favoring the Arab cause have "criticized the
solicitation of aid in this country as ‘immoral,
unreasonable, and possibly illegal. Meanwhile, at
least one blood-collecting agency has announced that
donations can be made to the Arab nations, if

desired. There the response has not been quite,so '

favorable. . , _
Indeed, the opposition to aid for ‘Israel being
collected appears" to -be based on the fact that such

collections have 'a better chance, of ‘success than 

similar programs intended to aid Egypt and‘ Syria. It
is a curious logic. Because more people are likely to,
give for Israel than to give for her enemies, such-gifts‘

are morally wrong.

,.This logic is neither new nor peculiarly American.

Six years ago I lived in'Paris., When the brief war of ‘
June 1967 began, public .sympathy tended-to favor.’

Israel. There was no logic to it. There is no more
logic topublicopinion than there is to private

opinion. It just happened thatimost of "the people -

who saw. a -nation of.'three millionrpeople in hot

combat with ’a consortium of nations totalling nearly‘

sixty million,'.were“inclined to favorthesmaller.

This was odd, I think, injl967, because most'of the
facts suggested that Israel ahd struck first. '

In Paris, there were calls _for money and for blood
that summer. There was one more dramatic plearefor
support. A_group‘, which was never too clearly
identiﬁed, sent out a call for volunteers. They were
not recruiting soliders’; they made that very clear.

They were loeking forpeople with technical and '
useful skills, people to take the places. of reservists

neededfuat the front. I p .-
’ The-. whole program was shadowy, and vague; in

the interests of offending no one, I supposed._ There '
was a large Arab population in Paris, and the French" A

government was one of the larger purveryors of arms
in the Middle East. ~' ' ' ’ .
Volunteers were ﬁrst told that they woulddepart
by chartered aircraft". Later they were told to make
their own”ways to-southern ports, to await ‘a ship.

Details were never speciﬁed. Opponents of aid’ to the

Israelis made a lot of noise; ‘I observed that they did ’

not ‘sendout their own‘ call for volunteers.

Inearly went to Israel. Many of myTfi'l—ond§ did go. , l:

-A I did not go because  '_sympathies—were not that
strong. I was inclined to favor Israel, partly for being
the underdog, and partly. because of what I

understood the intentions of_the two sides in the war ‘

to be. Israel appeared‘ to be interested in preserving
herbexistence, and did not seem to have any wish to

The Arabs. though. have been on record for a long
time as feeling that theirvictory will not be complete
until Israel is no more and the Jews are exterminated
or driven into the sea. ‘

Notmuch has changed. This time Israel did not

. make the first strike. -This time,lsrael is fighting for a

maximum result of restoring the cease-fire lines.
This time again Israel is threatened with total and
everlasting destruction. » '
The Foriegn Ministers of both Syria and Egypt
have accused Israel of aggression in the current

agression.» , , , ‘ ,. 
On their highest of Holy Days, the Israelis must;

This isnotall. Simultaneously, theymust have:
Gone into Syria, and; * ~ . ‘ I
Dragged a syrian army all the _way -to the top of
Mount Hebron. I . .

All this while pretending to pray!

As I.men_‘tioned earlier, a proper understanding of

_ the positions taken bylthe Arab nations and by their

supporters -requires a curious logic. It ispdifﬁcul-t,
enough‘ simply to ‘understand; years of practice are
required for its successful exercise.

Unless you are-prepared to believe that Israel

_commits aggression by its very existence, you will,3?..« V‘

ﬁnd this logic difﬁcult. Ifyou ﬁnd the thought of the
three million Israelis holding their sixty million
. enemies in abject terror silly," you will not_ be able to
follow Arab -logic. If you consider prayers of
atonement a sufﬁcient cause ‘for armed invasion,
though, you are on your_way.V  .
Now, aslin 1967, I"am sympathetic to Israel.
‘Within limits.  ' ». - ’
The whole Middle East, and most of the world, is
ruled by madmen. This will always be the case. The
madmen are considered too valuable to be risked in
the actions which grow from their policies. The
maldmenron both sides will undoubtedly survive, to
. invent new wars. The poor, the weak and the easily

led will die by the thousands. The overworked and

underfed will be taxed even closer td starvation in
order to ﬁnance this slaughter. -
It would be nice to have a new order: that if
‘Richard Nixon wished to ‘bomb Laos, he would have

to do it in person from Piper Cub; that if Anwar Sadat ‘

wished to invade Israel, he would be sent out alone
with a bow and arrows. It will not happen. '
I Ido‘ not approve of any of the madmen, but this

time‘._I am inclined to favor the Israelis. Their stake is ,

,enormou_s. ‘ .

* Israel may be gone when you read this.‘ In that 
case it will not matter what I thought’.

BY DAVE MAJERNIK,
While potential candidates in
next year's gubernatorial election
make transit proposals for Alleg-
heny County, the Port Authority

Transit (PAT) is quietly carrying

§7‘"%

‘ _’I’ittsburgh Mayor Pete Flaherty (a .

out its original ‘Action
Program.

Last Thursday, Governor Milton
J. Shapp (up for re-election next
year) announced his transit pro-

posal for Allegheny County, while

Early

possible challenger for the gover-
nor’s chair), has promised to reveal
his transit blueprint this week.
Shapp’s recommendations call
for rehabilitation ofthe South Hills
trolley service, construction of two
bus-only roads,_ improvement. of

commuter rail service around the ~
city, a rapid transit line to the_

Oakland-East End area, and
“deferred” construction of. the
so-called Skybus, or rapid electric

transit line tovthe South Hills.

__ ,_
'.' 3

. tant director for community rela'- ‘

Flaherty’s transit ‘plan is also
expected to oppose construction of
Skybus and to propose improved
commuter rail service. _

.Michael Scanlon, PAT’s assis-

tions, commented on Shapp’s
proposal. “We are not convinced
that _it is the best way to deal with
the County’s tratnsit-problems, but
we will certainly look at -it,” he
said. ’ '

Shapp’s recommendation is just
a proposal, Scanlon pointed out-,

' whereas PAT’s Early Action is a

program. The difference is that a .

 

program is designed, funded, and
under construction, while a pro-
posal is not. “It would take the
Shapp proposal about three or four

years to get where the Early Action

is now,” he said.

“Shapp is sincerely trying to
mediate political differences,”
explained Scanlon. “It is unprece-
dented for a governor to step into
the area of local transit because it is
outside his jurisdiction. But
because" ofllocal political stagna-
tion, it became necessary."

‘Scanlon, ‘however, had fewer
kind words for Mayor Pete ‘Flaherty
and County Commissioner William
Hunt, who both have bitterly
attacked Pat’s construction of the
Skybus system. ‘ The PAT official
labelled them “‘opportu‘nists” who

have deliberately taken the short- ‘

sighted transit route for “purely
political reasons.” A .
“By opposing the- PAT'program
in the name of tax relief,” he said,
“the two politicians have gotten
themselves free publicity in the
news media which they could not
otherwise afford. ' ‘ .
“They_(Flaherty and Hunt) hav
accused our ‘program_, of being
inflated. But the inflated costs
were caused by them because of
court fees and a year’s delay in

construction, which has increased
the'constructi_on costs.. Instead of '

Opera: Try it, You’ll like it.

BY ROSS HARRISON

As I sat down in the luxurious.
Heinz Hall office of Richard Karp.
Director and Conductor of the
Pittsburgh Opera, it soon became
apparent that Dr. Karp was very
anxious to reveal his feelings to
college students. -

Richard Karp is a native,
Austrian. He was Conductor of the

Dresden Residenz Theatre in 1924,

sic Director of Bonn. Germany in
1932 and was ousted by the Nazi
Government in 1933.

He has been director of the
Pittsburgh Opera since 1942 and
was Musical Advisor and Producer
of Radio Station KDKA until 1949.
Dr. Karp has been on the staff of
several universities, including the
University of Pittsburgh. Aside
from his work with ‘the Pittsburgh
Opera, Richard Karp has been a
guest conductor all over the world,
from Latin American to Western
Europe.

Dr. Karp wants very much to win
the young generation over to opera.

In discussing the backround to
Opera. Dr. Karp said. “Operas
were written to depict the styles
and customs of various periods and
cultures. To the student of history.

many different periods."

Richard Karp feels that the young
attach a stigma to the opera.
Many young people go on the false
assumption that you must arrive
formally dressed at an operatic
production. Dr. Karp urges the
young to come. dressed as they
like. Come to the opera as you
would go to the movies. Dr. Karp
pointed out that the least expensive
tickets are $4.50, 50 cents cheaper

John Cheever’s new The World
of Apples is certainly superior to
his last book.
much because Bullet Park (Chee-
ver’s third novel) despite good
writing had a far-fetched plot and
characters with names like‘Ham-
mer and Nailles. Cheever’.s
imagination had extended beyond

Alfred A.

plausibility in. this supposedly
realistic book.
Cheevcr’s stories are well

written in an
sophisticated style. Six of the ten
stories are written in the first
person, all narrated by men.’ The
stories fall short
success due to their superficiality,
rambling development, and their
unkind portrayal of women.

.The first story, the shortest, is
entitled “The Fourth Alarm”. The
narrator sits in the sun on a Sunday
morning, drinking gin and telling
how his wife, an elementary school
teacher and member of an amateur
theatrical group decided to try out
for the cast of a nude show. When
she gets the part. the narrator is
horrified and asks for a divorce. He
decides to see the show (which he
describes somewhat contemptu-
ously). When the cast invites the
audience to join them in onstage
nudity he complies, thinking it a
way to understand his‘ wife. Like
many of the stories-in the bookvit
deals with suburban life and -its
interruption-_ by some unusual "or
violent act. It displays nostalgia
and paranoia, to some extent, on

‘ the part of the narrator; and as in

most of these stories, the woman is
the culprit.
“Percy." is a
about the narrator's aunt nick-
named Percy. Like many of the

"stories it deals, sometimes nostal-

gically, sometimes objectively with
the past. It also contains evidence
of snobbery’ on the part of the
genteel narrator. Cheever.’s
considerable skill makes ‘this
engaging story enjoyable.

“Artemis, the Honest Well

Digger” the book’s longest story is ,

one of the weakest partly because
of it’s length. Artemis the honest
but somewhat naive well digger
takes a two week trip to Russia to
escape from a married woman
infatuated with him. Artemis falls
in love in Russia but is only able to
have one evening with Natasha, a
marshal’s daughter. He corre-
sponds with her, proposing marri-
age, but because of some amazing
coincidences, the correspondence
is curtailed. The U.S. State
Department thinks that Artemis
and Natasha are passing -classified

This story, which reminds this
reader of‘ Jerzy Kosinski’siBeing
There, is overly long.
’*‘Montraldo,” which begins,
“The first time, I robbed Tiffany’s,
i_t was raining”, develops into a
story, set in Italy about an
“eccentric old spiinster -and her
cranky servant.” V This story is
marred by yet another of Cheever’s
malevolent women and a contrived
ending. .
The first of the “Three Stories”

story about a lady who loses her

Stories" ends with another shorty
showing the distance between
liusban‘d and wife, the wife again
cold, the husband again attempting
to be kind and understanding. This
story is rather contrived. The
book's last two stories are its
finest. “The Geometry of Love" is
about a man who tries to apply
Eucliii toward solving his personal
problems. The man's wife. like
most of the other women in the
book is_ nasty and unsymathetic.

The book as a whole, while’

distinguished by the author's
sophistication, talent for anec-

. ‘ With Indiana leading West Virginia-twoitouchdowns at halftime
last week, the chant at Mountaineer Fieldwas, “Beat The ‘Hell Out Of

‘,Pit_t." To. the West Virginia f,ans,'.beat'ing Pitt makes the season.

A look at the history of the seriesishows why the Mountaineers are so

obsessed with defeating their neighbors to.the_ North... Pitt leads‘ the

series, 43-21-1. In the past six years, however, West Virginia has been
victorious five times. The lone Pitt victory ' was a classic, an
unbelievable 36-35 win after trailing 35-7 at thehalf.

However, West Virginia has gone through some lean years__ while
From 1906» through 1911, WVU did not score a point
against Pitt. In the 1930's, the Mounties managedjust 12 pointsnbeing
shut out eight times in‘ ten_years. .  vi

With the Major change in Pitt Football beginning this year, it may
take some time before Pitt turns its record around from recent years.

; «However, beating West Virginia is a priority thatshould begin this

Saturday. g ~ g .

When the Pitt team hits Morgantown Saturday, it will.be greeted by
signs, T-shirts, and neckties, allproclaiming, _“Beat The Hell Out 'Of
Pitt.” One must assume that this is a fairly recent phenomenon, since
West Virginia didn’t beat much hellout of Pitt until, the 1960’s. T he
"only way to stop it appears to be beating the hell out of West Virginia.

«“I don’t think that anybody’ is going to beatthe hell out of us,” said

Pitt monster-back Mike Bulino. ~“Tha‘t saying getsjme pretty mad. It’s

-like a cut; I take it personally.” A . . A
“It bothers me‘too',’.’said fullback Dave Janasek. ‘ “It makes me

i want the game-a_,little more, Really, that saying helps us.”

Panther center »Mike Carey, 1ike'many members of the Pitt squad,

was recruited by West Virginia. “They told me not to come to Pitt, ” he’

recalled. “They said Pitt was a,.bunch of losers. They told my brother

thesame thing. (Carey's brother Pat is a freshman Pitt quarterback) _
For the many out-of-state newcomers to the Pitt ;team, the fierceness’

of this rivalry is,not_ known too well: A drive through downtown

Morgantown should quickly indoctrinate them however,‘ and the term‘

used on the Panther defense, “Mad Dogs," may really apply

, Saturday." . —

Mountaineer head coach Bobby Bowden‘ ‘tries to play down the

rivalry factor.- ,‘‘It’s a big “game for the ‘fans, but they don’t;play the _
' games,” said Bowden. “We need a win verybadly afterlosing‘ last
week, and the fact that we’re playing Pitt doesn’t make our players _,
.' much more psyched than if _it was another opponent.” ‘ ,
Many WVU playersare from Pennsylvania, and this contributes to
the rivalry. However, all of Pitt's remaining games will feature many ,

-West Penn‘ gridders, and the sameholds true for West'Virginia.

, “The spirit and enthusiasim of the Pitt team really worries me
though." said Bowden. _ '

Indeed, “Beat The Hell Out Of Pitt”~ may contribute ‘to a Panther

‘victory, on Saturday.’ What Pitt really'needs though is a string of

convincing wins that will put those words "out of a certain state’s
vocabulary. Saturday at 1:30 is the time that this hopefully will start.

. Like the Major change, it will take a while toalter the WVU chant.

Hopefully, there has been enough of a Major change right now to get

things on the right track. v

The University police must be getting paid by the number of parking ‘

tickets they write. At least this is the obvious conclusion one must

' reach. There are no parking facilities for the players on the team or the V
news media. When a gridder or writer parks in the “permit" lot at the

stadium. the cars are tagged daily, despite the fact that thespaces are

not used at the time of practices. A 1 . - ' ,
The situation is absurd. Athletic Director Cas Myslinski,‘or someone

else who has the atithiorityshould demand that authorized persons be

permitted to park inithe lot on a space-available basis. Space is always , 

avai_lable.‘ In the meantime, the Pittimeter maids, I mean policemen,

When Dorsett was hit in the back

gametime whether “he will be able .

The controversial foul rule was

  IM Playoffs A dvance

BY RICK SHRUM
As intramural softball playoffs
continue to grind down. the cream
of the program's cropcontinues to
‘emerge to the top. Following
Sunday afternoon's action.
unheralded team known as Civil
Engineers 11 entered the campus
title picture by winning the hotly
contested Engineering ‘League
title.
The Civils methodically took
apart Civils 1, 5-0, to move into the
campus quarterﬁnals against the

currently undetermined lndepen-.

dent champs. However, they
nearly missed.’ their chance. for

campus supremacy when they were

forced to" come from behind to
defeat the Mechanical Engineers,
4-3, in a league semiﬁnal.

The Mechanics forged ahead

' with two runs in the top of the

second. Kevin Marsden and Dean
Gaertner singled, and one out later
Ron Biurca tripled both home for a
2-0 lead.

However, the Civs did not take
long to explode. They tied the
game in the bottom of fourth on a
two-run homer by Bob Mazur, and

went ahead with a single run in the
fifth. Tom Witherel led the inning
off with a single, but is appeared
he’d remain there following two
consecutive flyouts. However, Vic
Minello and Jim Mereuri kept the
inning alive with back-to-back

singles, scoring Witherel with the .

lead run.

Everything looked good for the
Civs going to the top of the
seventh. They only had to prevent
the Mechanics from scoring for
three more outs. It looked like a
menial task. as the Mechanics’ bats
slumbered the previous four
innings. _

. Unfortunately forithe Civs, ME's
bats were suffering from a mild
case of insomnia. Keith Bell
opened the inning with a single,
and one out later Mark Walker
singled him to second. Marsden
walked to load the bases. which set
the stage for Geartner's tying
single. his second hit of the game.

Withe the possibility of extra
innings facing them, the Civs
decided not to tire themselves out
for the finals. With one. out,
Witherel and Don Nicholssingled
Dave Gle_nn_stepped to the plate,

and lofted a fly down the right field _ _

line that was misplayed by the right
fielder. Witherel scored, and "the
Civs went into
championship game.
Although the Civs passed two
crucial tests Sunday, their toughest
competition isjust ahead. To reach

the semiﬁnals, they will have to 
beat a good Independent champ‘, 
no matter whom it may be. If they

pass that test. they may have to

face their greatest challenge of the . .

year--the Charlie Browns.
