PSfP calls

contract
‘appalling’

By Michael J. Lowe

The war in the gulf may be
over, but the University of
Pittsburgh is still reaping some

ﬁfinancial beneﬁts from it. The
Learning Research and
Development Center has been
awarded a $5 million contract
from the Air Force to refine a
computer system that LRDC
initially developed in 1984.

This has caused concern among
the Pittsburgh Students for Peace.

“I find this extremely appalling,”
Jill Castek, a member ofthe PSfP,
said. Castek and other PSfP
members said that Pitt President
Wesley Posvar is ignoring the
demands that they made in a
letter delivered on Feb. 25. The

contracts, the elimination of
armed-services recruitment from
campus, suspension of ROTC
recruitment and the elimination
of ROTC programs. ,

“This is leading to the
militarization of our campus,”
Castek said. She said that the
university should have nothing
to do with defense contracts and
said that the technology being
created could go toward

“educating people rather than
toward the military.

Castek said that the contract is
sending a message to society that
the “war machine” is the only
part ofsociety worth investing in.

The program is an innovative
interactive computer system
developed by LRDC that trains
workers to perform difficult tasks
in electronic maintenance.

Pitt Greeks converged on the back lawn of the
Cathedral of Learning yesterday to participate in
this year’s Greek Olympiad.

Fraternities and sororities were organized into
six different match groups to compete in the
seven events, which included everything from a
volleyball tournament to a cake—making race.

In the first event of the day, the spoon race,
contestants had to take a spoon attached to a
long length of string and run it under their shirt
and pants. They had to pass it to the next person

In the next event, the clothes race, competitors

University
Democrats
reorganize

By Megan Bertino
siaﬂr Writer

University Democrats have
reorganized after more than a
year of inactivity.

Formerly called College Young
Democrats, the group died out
after the 1988 presidential
election. Joel Leonard, a junior
majoring in political science, has
reorganized the group and set
new goals for the future.

According to Leonard,
lfniversity Democrats hope to
promote party candidates at all
levels of government as well as
raise political awareness on
campus. The group also hopes to
help students understand the way
governmental decisions directly
influence their lives.

“A lot of college students don’t
think issues really affect them;
they’re more worried about
classes and grades,” said Leonard.
He pointed out that the city’s
attempt to strip Pitt of its tax-
exempt status directly affects Pitt
students. “Ifthat happens, where
will the extra money come from?
Students at Pitt are not immune
from city politics.”

University Democrats also
wants to help get people
registered to vote and to
encourage more people to vote
in the primaries and elections.

“Only you can make a
difference," said Leonard. "One
little vote does count."

Leonard hopes to use his
firsthand experience in politics
to help University Democrats
fulfill its goals.

Leonard recently transferred
from the University of Texas at
Arlington, where he became
involved in politics during his
freshman year. He originally
began working on the 1988
presidential campaign, backing
Illinois Sen. Paul Simon. However,
when Simon was unsuccessful in

Elimination of OFD would not mean reduction of services

By Jenifer Crook
Staﬂ" Writer

lfthe Office for Faculty Development is
eliminated, there will not be a reduction in
advisory services for Pitt faculty, according
to Associate Provost Jack Daniel.

Daniel said that the provost’s advisory

atcommittee on undergraduate programs

metTuesday to begin discussing the OFD’s
future. Once it reaches a consensus, the
committee will forward its
recommendation to the Provost’s Office.

“If the office is eliminated,” said Daniel,
“we have a number of plans to provide at
least the same services in a better fashion.”
The OFD currently offers faculty members

workshops, videotapes and consultations
aimed at improving their teaching skills.

Theuniversityrecommendedelirninating
the OFD as “one of a number of things
considered by the provost’s office to reduce
costs. This is being done in context with
the university’s current fiscal status,” said
Daniel. If eliminated, OFD’s present
services would be provided by already
existing offices, saving the university the
administrative expenses of maintaining
the office, according to Daniel.

Daniel said that faculty and students
should not view the proposal as the
university backing away from its
commitment to improving teaching and
undergraduate education.

“People constantly ask, ‘Why don't we
eliminate administrative costs?’ I’m asking
that people don’t confuse a reduction of
administrative costs with the reduction of
services. We plan to not reduce but to
increase the services.”

Faculty members opposed to the OFD’s
elimination are concerned that the
administration may continue providing
material services, such as classroom
videotapes, but will not replace the
coaching given by OFD’s professionally
trained staff. Daniel disagreed.

"We are in the process of attaining
people already in the system who are
qualified to professionally advise the
faculty.”

Daniel added that many faculty members
have a misconception that the decision to
cut the OFD has been finalized.

Daniel said that once the
recommendation is completed by the
provost’s committee, it must be reviewed
by the office of the vice president for
planning and budget, the executive
committee of the faculty senate and Pitt
Provost Donald Henderson.

“Some ofthe concerns ofelimination are
premature, given all the levels of review
still to come," Daniel said.

“I think the faculty have a very legitimate
concern with improving teaching, and we
intend to be very responsive to those
concerns,”he added.

Pitt hosts international education conference

By Amy Kapusta
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s School of Education
hosted the Comparative and
International Education Society’s
annual conference from March
14 to 17 at the Holiday Inn,
University Center.

“CIES is concerned with
educating people within the
global conference," said Mark
Ginsburg, professor of education
and sociology and director of
Pitt’s Institute for International
Studies in education, who
organized the event this year.

Approximately 500 people from
around the world attended the
conference.

The conference had many panel
presentations.

Some of the topics discussed
were Asian vs. Western Values,
Relationships and Ideals;
Educating and Changing Social
Realities in Africa; and The Uses
of Technology in Education.

A few of the speakers were
unable to attend.

One couple scheduled to speak,
Mohammad and Varsen Shahin,
was unable to book a flight to the
United States due to the current

problems in the Middle East.

Ruth Bradbury La.-Monte from
the University of Alabama was
the chairperson scheduled for the
couple's plenary, and she was
very upset that the Shahins could
not make it.

“They were unable to make the
flight out of Palestine and were
very upset because she was
pregnant and wanted to be back
in the States to have her baby,”
she said.

David Stoloff, a professor at
Sonoma State University in
California, was one of the speakers
at the conference.

“The conference this year is
very well organized. Dr. Ginsburg
has done a very effective job.
He’s had a lot of headaches
putting this type of conference
together,” Stoloff said.

Stoloff, a member of CIES for
13 years, said this was the first
time the society held a conference
in Pittsburgh.

Although most people at the
conference said they were there
to be educated, Stoloff had a
different view.

“The key is  seeing friends.
That’s why you come here,"
Stoloff said.

Student groups participate in Peace andfustice Fair

By Amy Kapusta
For The Pill News

Several Pitt student organizations
participated Saturday in an International Peace
and Justice Pair that was held at the Holiday
Inn at University Center.

The fair, which was sponsored by Pitt’s
Institute for International Studies in Education,
featured groups from the Pittsburgh area who
came to share information on peace and

justice. It lasted from 7 to 11 p.m.

Tina Howard, a sophomore at Pitt, worked
at the Pittsburgh Students for Peace table.

“People think it’s great that college students
are so interested in peace and justice. They
think it’s important that the younger generation
gets involved in the movement and
understands what the movement is all about.
I’ve had a lot of positive reactions," Howard
said.

Another Pitt organization, Students Against

Racism, was also represented at the fair. Chris
Moleski, a senior at Pitt, said the fair was an
opportunity to meet with groups that have
views similar to StAR’s.

“We like to make people aware of the
racism on this campus and also get involved
with networking at other campuses to fight
against racism,” Moleski said.

She said the fair was going well and that
many of the groups were passing out

“The 14 points contain the basic

I-iffinger said the 14-point plan was
“created to change the conditions [for] the

“\\"hile we are here, we deserve a real
education that inspires us to work for our
people,” said Effinger.

Laing presented three main goals during
his campaign speech, one of which is
implementing the 14-point plan. Laing
began, “Basically, the reason I would like
to be chairman is because I would like to
help change the overall climate for black
people on this campus.”

The need to increase the power ofblack
students and communication among the
BAS administration and BAS members
were l.aing’s other main objectives.

Laing said students should be aware that

Society suﬂers from lack of intimacy

By Rebecca Wilkins
Stqﬂ’ Writer

Modesty and respect are key
factors for a lasting, intimate
relationship, according to
renowned Jewish scholar and
lecturer Manis Friedman.

“The person that you have to
see again tomorrow and maintain
a relationship with is the person
we need to be most modest with,”
he said. “How are you going to
live with a person for 60 years
and not have the familiarity breed
contempt?” asked Friedman.

Friedman spoke to students
about “Intimacy, Privacy and
Relationships” Thursday evening
at CM.

“Intimacy in modern life has
become somewhat of a mystery,
an elusive quality that everybody
chases but can’t seem to catch up
to. There’s a problem with
intimacy in our society, a problem
of a lack of intimacy,” he said.

In addition to being a rabbi, the
father of 14 children, the host of
his own television show and the

 

author of“Doesn’t Anyone Blush
Anymore?,” Friedman is co-
founder and dean of the Bais
Chana Institute of Jewish Studies
in Minnesota, a yeshiva for
women, which was founded in
1971.

The lecture was sponsored by
Chabad House, an international
organization that provides an
extension of Jewish family life
for college students.

“We know that there’s a
problem with intimacy by the
euphemisms that we use to
describe human relationships,”
Friedman said, citing the
chronological progression of the
terms “dating somebody,” “going
out with somebody” and “seeing
somebody.”

Friedman acknowledged that
the Torah also uses a euphemism
for intimate male/female
relationships.

“The Bible says, ‘Adam knew
Eve, and she conceived,”’ he said.
“However, the Torah is using an
appropriate euphemism. The
appropriate euphemism for

intimacy is knowing, because
knowing is an intimacy of_ sorts,
and ultimately all intimacy begins
with knowing.”

Friedman said that modern
society has adopted the use of
euphemisms as a means of self-
protection.

“We are afraid to become
emotionally entangled. We are
afraid to become emotionally
vulnerable because we’re afraid
of the hurt that comes with being
intimate,” he said.

“If we’re protecting ourselves
from intimacy while we’re
attempting an intimate
relationship, we cheat ourselves
of the intimacy. Now, obviously
this fear of intimacy is coming
from the fear of vulnerability.
You have to be vulnerable to be
intimate."

Friedman also commented on
the current openness regarding
intimacy.

“When we take those things
that belong to the private part of
our lives, to the intimate part, and

Activist Eirene urges
Allies to end embargo

By Eric Hoch
Smﬂ‘ Writer

The war will not be over until the allied coalition lifts the
embargo on Iraq, according to activist Vince Eirene.

“With the embargo still on, food and medical supplies are not
getting into Iraq,” Eirene said at a peace meeting at Carnegie
Mellon on Thursday. “Babies are being fed flour and water
instead of milk, and without the medical supplies, 10 times the
amount of people who died in the war will die from diseases
such as cholera. This is not war; this is murder.”

The Iraqi trades office, part of the Department of Commerce
in Washington, D.C., was unavailable for comment.

Eirene opened the meeting with a videotape made by a
private filming company called “Peace TV.” This videotape
depicted Eirene committing acts of civil disobedience, getting
arrested at CM’s Software Engineering Institute and discussing
the power of civil disobedience.

“The only way we can speak out to the injustice is by
breaking the law — the law that protects the injustice,” Eirene
said. “It was the same thing with the civil—rights movements.
Blacks were not allowed to sit at white tables in restaurants.
They were not allowed to drink from white water fountains.
They broke those laws to draw attention to the injustices behind
those laws.”

Eirene told the students that the same thing can be done to
stop military research at CM. These tactics can also bring
attention to other problems, like the embargo, said Eirene.

“We must make creative tension,” said Eirene. “It is not
enough to demonstrate to get congressional attention. We have
a chance to affect the personality ofthe public at large and show
them the injustices. Our strength lies in the truth not in
numbers.”

Spending time in jail is worth the sacrifice, said Eirene.

“What is 10 days, one month, one year in jail compared to the
suffering of the homeless in the U.S. and the suffering of
oppression throughout the world?” asked Eirene.

New CAS
withdrawal
policy upsets
Pitt students

By Kathy Kmiecik
Sta_ﬂ' Writer

As the deadline for withdrawing
from classes passed, some
students were upset about a new
withdrawal procedure.

This term, the College of Arts
and Sciences began requiring that
students get their professors’
signatures before withdrawing
from a class.

On Friday several students
voiced their disapproval of the
new policy.

“It would be a lot easier if we
didn’t need a signature. Whats
the difference if you’re dropping
the class anyway?” sophomore
Jeff Casciani said.

Freshman Caterinajoseph said,
“Last semester I dropped a class,
and I didn’t need a signature.
Now I need one; it’s a hassle.”

Not all students had a problem
with the new withdrawal
procedure.

“I didn’t think it was a problem
at all. My professor made it really
easy. But I could see how it
could be a problem if you have a
teacher who didn’t want to sign
it,” Katie Szczepaniek said.

Dr. Linda Burns, assistant dean
of CAS, said the change was

implemented f or several reasons.

The School of Engineering and
several other schools already
require the signature on
withdrawal forms, so the change
helps to maintain uniformity
throughout the university,
according to Burns.

The change was also adopted
because of requests from
professors who wanted to know
which students were dropping
their class, Burns said.

Burns stressed that the signature
does not signify permission to
withdraw but is merely a way of
letting the teacher know who is
withdrawing.

Burns said there are other
advantages to the policy.

“In a way I think it’s good to let
the teacher know. It might
prevent some students from
withdrawing prematurely,” Burns
said.

Although Friday was the
deadline for the withdrawal forms
to be turned in, those students
who brought forms in not
knowing that a signature was
required were given an extension
until next Tuesday, according to
Burns.

SGB wants groups to be accountable for funds

By Tammy Stradley
Sta 1r Writer

Although there have been questions about
how the Student Government Board spends
its SO-percent share of the student activities
fee, many students are not aware about the
allocation of the other half of the fee,
according to SGB President Brent Saunders.

“People, students especially, question
how student government spends their 50
percent," said Saunders, “but no one seems
to know or care about the other 50 percent. ”

The remaining 50 percent, which amounts
to over $400,000, is divided between the
Pitt Program Council, the Media Board and
WPTS.

Saunders did not accuse the organizations
of misusing the funds, but he said the
organizations should be accountable to
students in explaining how they spend
their portion of the fee.

“I’m not saying that there’s anything wrong
with the way that the money is used, but
there’s really no official check," Saunders
said.

“I think there should be more awareness
as far as where the other money goes.
Students have a right to know," Saunders
said.

Saunders would like a representative from
the SGB involved with the organizations
because the SGB is supposed to be the
safeguard of the student activities fee. He
did not think the representative should
make decisions for the various organizations,
but he wanted more communication about
how the fee is used.

The Pitt Program Council does have a
Representative Liaison Committee, with
members from the Graduate and Professional
Student Association, the College of General
Studies and the College of Arts and Sciences.
The committee is directly involved in the

PPC budget.

“Everyone we get money from is
represented," said Tom Misuraca, assistant
director of student activities responsible for
the PPC.

“The positions exist and IGSPA, CGS and
CASI can appoint whoever they want,”
Misuraca said.

PPC’s budget is submitted to the Office of
Student Activities.

WPTS adviser Ron Asbury said there
would be no problem with an SGB
representative present at meetings when
\l(/PTS is making its budget.

Asbury said the WPTS budget is not a
secret; it is submitted to the Office of
Student Activities, where it is accessible to
anyone.

Saunders said access to the budgets at
the Office of Student Activities is after the
fact and ineffective for the for the safeguard
process.

Broken promises...

, According to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the war
in the Persian Gulf has made him realize the need for a
better form of government.

Following the lead of many Eastern European countries,
Saddam has promised new democratic reforms in Iraq for
the first time during his 12-year tenure. He announced his
intentions Saturday during his first appearance to his
people since the end of the gulf war.

At first glance, this offer seems as though the gulf war
may have brought an end to Saddam’s cruel reign over his
country. The move, however, merely verifies the extent
to which he is committed to keep his hold on power.

Saddam stated that Iraq will become a multi-party
government, something virtually unheard of in the Arab
world. He also said that a new constitution will be drafted
and offered for discussion with the Iraqi parliament.

A constitution in Iraq will have little effect upon the
actual procedures in the country until the dictator is
removed from power. Dictators generally do what they
want regardless of a country’s wishes.

But Saddam’s reforms even go beyond that. He said that
a new parliament would be elected by the people.
Unfortunately, Iraq’s parliament really doesn’t control
much of the country. That power falls solely under the
responsibility of the dictator.

Iraq’s parliament is merely a microphone for Saddam’s
voice. Whatever is his policy automatically becomes the
parliament’s policy. Electing a new parliament, therefore,
does little for the Iraqi people, who have plunged the
country into a bloody civil war to get Saddam out of
power.

Saddam did not give a timetable for any of these
reforms. This most likely means that they will not be
implemented any time soon and in fact cannot be
expected to come to fruition.

This pattern is similar to that of the process followed by
the Eastern European countries during the past three
years. Citizens demand reform. Civil strife breaks out in
the streets. The government buckles under pressure and
resigns. Democratic elections are held.

This procedure, however, lacks the resignation of the
country’ s leader, the only move which will ultimately give
Iraqis any freedom. Saddam Hussein must be removed
from power before any of this can or will take place.

It must be decided by the Iraqi people who they want
to lead them out of the misery that was the Persian Gulf
war. Half-hearted democratic reforms, however, will not
get them anywhere. Full reforms are necessary and will
not come while the man who led them into the war
remains in power..-

Vague thoughts...

Saddam, Soviets top list of targets

Not that it matters, but:

oDoes the name “Nuremberg”
ring a bell with anyone? I'm pretty
sure it should to Saddam Hussein.

No, not because I’m comparing
him to Hitler. (Enough people
have already done that.) The
stories coming from the ex-
prisoners of war are pretty
horrifying: electric shocks from
wires placed around their faces
and severe beatings. One prisoner
said, “About 90 percent of the
time you felt you were in danger
of losing your life.”

Under the rules set forth by the
Geneva Convention concerning
POWs, those are considered “war
crimes” and are punishable by
execution. The Senate, behind
the work of Sen. Arlen Specter
(R.-Pa.), has approved a
resolution urging the United States
to go after Saddam and his gang
for this very purpose.

The people who were executed

at Nuremberg were executed for 1

war crimes against thejews. They
deserved their punishment. Now
that our friend has conveniently
felt the need to torture these
men, something must be done.
Martyr status or not, Saddam
Hussein must be brought to world
court to face these charges. If he
is executed, so be it. If he is jailed
somewhere horrible, so be it. But
he must face the crimes he has
committed against both the
Kuwaiti people and the allied

’ POWs.

0 Better yet, let's leave him there
and just take away his army. With
the riots currently taking place
inside Iraq by disgruntled citizens,
I think he would probably be
given sufficient punishment once
they get hold of him.

-Great Now the Soviets have
turned to kidnapping former
world leaders for their “safety.”

Last week, former East German
leader Erich Honecker was
airlifted out of Berlin to Moscow
to prevent him from standing trial

for killing East Germans trying to ~

 

Jeff
Tatusko

escape over the now-defunct
Berlin Wall. The Soviets have
claimed that he was taken to
Moscow because there are no
kidney-dialysis machines in
Berlin.

Now granted, Berlin may not
be the Presbyterian University
Hospital of the world, but I’m
sure that somewhere in a city of
about five million people, there
is bound to be some sort of
primitive dialysis machine.

Seeing as how the Germans
won't get him back short of a

successful, full-scale invasion of I’

the Soviet Union, Honecker is
safe. I don’t think the Germans’
“diplomatic protest" and
‘energetic, diplomatic requests"
are going to get very far.

-The state budget is in trouble.
Gee, what a surprise.

The chairperson of the state's
House Appropriations
Committee, Rep. Dwight Evans
(D-Phila.), said last week that the
budget was severely lacking in
economic development,
children's and youth services 
The list goes on and on. The
House has already rejected many
parts of the budget.

Now, as I said before, this
really does not surprise me. I
wasn’t really thrilled with it when
it came out What did surprise me
was the comment made by Evans
in a story in Friday's (Post-

. Gazette He said, ‘I will come up

." 1

with what it takes to address the
problems and concerns of this
state on a short— and long—term
basis.”

Hmm, I think this man has a
slight identity problem. Do you
get the feeling he’s been wearing
his Superman Underoos just a
little too long? I

, -On the home front, I think it’s
fair to say that the University of
Pittsburgh doesn’t have a legal
leg to stand on anymore. Since
federal Judge Russell G. Clark
decided that the Buckley
Amendment does not cover
campus police records, the
university’s case is basically
destroyed. »

However, John Yeager, vice
president for administration,
doesn’t want to give up just yet.
He said that it’s terrible to think
that the university would hide
anything from the public. Yeah,
like rape statistics, armed
robberies, information on exactly
where our tuition goes 

C’mon, Mr. Yeager. The ﬁght is
over and lost. By denying public
access to the records, you’re
making the administration look
not only bad, but also foolish.

0 Hallelujah. I have finally found
something that the students of
this university care about Yes,
it's tournament time. The ballroom
in the Wfilliam Pitt Union Thursday
was packed with screaming
students (many of which, I realize,
probably had money on the
game) cheering their basketball
team on to a 76-68 victory over
Georgia.

It is nice to see that students at
this university can get excited
over more than Wings Night at
the SOD and Zelda's. Maybe now
they can see what actually
happens on this campus. Maybe
they could even (gasp!) get
involved!

Somehow, I doubt it.

Infotainment becoming ugly Wave of the future

Probably one of the most
disturbing trends in modern
American culture seems to be
getting worse instead of better.
People in positions of authority at
major television stations and
networks as well as in Hollywood
have stood idly by while a minority
of egotistical social engineers have
embarked upon a campaign for
American “enlightenment.”
Several months ago, New
Dimensions ran an article
describing what the author termed
as “infotainment” — the deliberate
clouding of the boundaries
between information and
entertainment, so thatunfairsocial
commentary can be force-fed to
an unsuspecting public. Before
anyone reading this dismisses my
point as some sort of right—wing
paranoia, allow me to offer a few
examples.

The original idea for writing

this came to me as I watched the
ABC movie “Son of the Morning
Star” a few weeks ago. I had
hoped that for once George
Armstrong Custer would not be
portrayed as some sort of mentally
deficient bigot whose only aim in
life was to eliminate the Indian
nations. This hope died within an
hour, as the movie degenerated
into the same sort of revisionist
historical analysis that one might
expect from University History I
(Self—Denigration and Our
American Heritage).

The ultimate revisionism
occurred in a scene between
President Grant and Gen.
Sheridan, where they “conspired”
in the Oval Office to send Custer
to his death at Little Big Horn,
secure in the knowledge that his
death would lead to a final
conclusion of the Indian problem
via their extinction. Certainly the

Tom
Lester

United States has things to be
ashamed of, but let’s remember
that Crazy Horse's band of
murderous rogues were running
roughshod over the Indian and
white populations alike outside
of the borders to which he agreed.

During this movie I was also
treated to commercials for an
upcoming episode of
“thirtysomething” where one of
the characters fed the public his
hatred of religion, particularly
Christianity. After the fourth or
fifth airing of this commercial, I
began to think of when I last saw
a human and fair portrayal on
television of anyone with sincere
religious or Christian values. It’s

been four weeks, and I still can’t
think of a recent example where
a religious person hasn't been
portrayed as some self—righteous,
hypocritical nut whose life
borders on the criminal.

Still not convinced’ Did anyone
see the episode of “Law and
Order” where pro-life
demonstrators were depicted as
overzealous terrorists bent on
killing anyone in their path to
self-righteousness? It must have
done wonders for National
Abortion Rights Action League
and National Organization for
Women recruitment. I know
several pro-lifers, and nonefit the
television mold, just as none have
ever been connected to a
bombing of an abortion clinic. Is
it too much to ask for fairness
from Hollywood?

Finally, being an National Rifle
Association member has given

me a true appreciation for the
severity of
episode of ‘Murphy Brown” gave
us the intriguing image of the cast
throwing darts at an NRA poster
while spending several minutes
ripping into the NRA’s viewpoints.
Virtually the same thing occurred
on the episode of “Head of the
Class,” in which everyone used a
class project as a vehicle to
complain about supposedly
lenient gun laws (even though
the show takes place in New
York City, of all places). The
show was, simply put, a
commercial for Handgun Control,
Inc., from the opening minutes.
Editorializing is a great part of
America’s freedom of speech, but
let’s keep news and opinions
disguised as news in their proper
domain.

~ Campus teac/:2-in sbowed only one side of the war

On Feb. 20 I attended a seminar entitled,
“Argument and Action: A Panel Discussion”
at the teach—in. On the ﬂyer distributed by
those sponsoring this activity, I saw the
names of two well-known peace activists,
butl didn't know who the other two panel
members were. I naturally thought they
would be representatives of those who
support the war. So I dragged my naive
self to this teach—in, hoping to hear some
good discussion about the war in the
Persian Gulf. To say I was shocked at what
I saw is a gross understatement.

Seven o’clock finally rolled around, and
I sat down to listen to what these people
had to say. The first five minutes were very
enlightening. It turned out that the panelists
were ALL peace activists, and that it was
obvious that this was going to be totally
one-sided. I wish to focus on the comments
made by Melissa Moran, who dropped out
of school on Jan. 16 to become a full—time
peace protester (smart career move) and

Gary
Houston

those by Bob Anderson from Veterans for
Peace.

All four panelists went to the microphone
and gave speeches. Moran spoke about
how the war was immoral, and those who
support it are immoral. She said that the
anti-war viewpoint was the moral answer
and totally ignored the fact that it was just
her opinion, and she had no right to judge
just what is moral and what isn’t. Everybody
has different opinions of what is moral,
but apparently she must have had a vision
from God or something that gave her the
power to make that decision.

Anderson really made my blood pressure
rise. He criticized those who wear yellow
ribbons in support of our troops, our
troops themselves and everybody who

doesn’t share his opinion of the war. He
encouraged our troops just to drop their
guns and not fight. I happen to be a
veteran also, and he should remember
that in wartime desertion is an offense
punishable by execution. Anderson said
that he couldn't support the troops because
they were doing wrong. Fine — there are
millions of other Americans who do support
them, and his support won't be missed.
This “teach-in” was nothing but a blatant
display of anti-Americanism. Nobody can
refute that fact. George Bush was blamed
for everything from AIDS to earthquakes
in Ecuador. The panelists complained
about our bombing of Iraqi military targets
in Kuwait and Iraq but conveniently forgot
about the atrocities committed against the
Kuwaiti people or the deliberate attacks
against Israeli civilians. Why don’t they
mention those facts? Because they have
determined that this country is the world’s
bad guy, and they want to mold the United

States to fit their vision. To hell with good
sense and the wishes of the vast majority
of American citizens. They place all the
blame for this war on George Bush and
ignore the fact that it was Saddam Hussein
who overran and brutalized a peaceful
nation.

It also struck me that only 50 percent or
so of the people attending were actually
Pitt students. The teach-in was advertised
as a debate on the war but in actuality was
nothing but a forum for the dispersal of
radical left—wing propaganda. Fortunately,
I have faith in people's abilities to
differentiate pipe dreams from reality.
Instead of persuading me that this war is
wrong, this “teach-in” did nothing but
reaffirm my conviction that this war was
just, necessary and deserving of the
overwhelming public support it received.

Art endowment should be abolished to save money

The major news media in this
country often treat issues as if
they are only two—sided. Very
often, it is implied that there are
only two possible opinions
concerning a particular issue. In
many of these cases, there are
actually more than two
viewpoints.

An excellent example of this
is the recent debate concerning
the National Endowment for the
Arts. According to what I have
seen on network television and
in many newspapers and
magazines, the current debate
on the NEA contains only two
viewpoints. For the sake of
clarity, I will refer to these
viewpoints as A and B.

Opinion A is held by Jesse
Helms and other members of
the “moral majority." According
to this opinion, NEA grants
should be given only to artists
whose art meets certain

government criteria. Specifically,
the holders of this opinion do
not want NEA funding to go to
art which is “obscene,” whatever
that means.

Opinion B is held by many
members of the arts community.
This view states that the NEA
should give out grants with
absolutely no restrictions
whatsoever.

In a recent letter to the editor
in The Pittsburgh Prms, a writer
stated, “In supporting the re-
authorization of the National
Endowment for the Arts, we are
affirming that freedom which
every citizen in this country
acknowledges and respects as
an inalienable right.”

The supporters of this opinion
believe that in order for free
speech to exist, the federal
government must give out grants
to any artist who wants one.

I disagree with both of these

 

Daniel
Alman

opinions. I have formulated my
own opinion concerning the
NEA. I will refer to this as view
C.

The NEA should be abolished.
The federal income tax could be
lowered by $171 million, which
is the NEA’s current budget. If
this were to happen, then each
individual person could choose
how to spend his or her own

money.

If a person wishes to support
a certain type of art, then he or
she can make a voluntary
contribution to it. If a person
does not wish to support a
certain type of art, or even any
art at all, then he or she would
not have to.

I favor abolishing the NEA
because I believe in freedom.
Ours is a nation comprised of a
quarter-billion human beings,
and each of these human beings
should be free to choose what
to do with the money that he or
she earns.

Each of these human beings
should make his or her own
decisions concerning how he or
she spends money on art.

Views A and B, both of which
I disagree with, have something
in common. Both views have a
complete and total disregard for
individual freedom. Both views

favor governmental power over
individual freedom. Because of
this, I disagree with both.

According to the major news
media, views A and B are total
opposites. But as I see it, the two
views are 99 percent identical.
Both views place the power of
the government at a higher level
of importance than that of
individual freedom.

But my view, view C, places a
complete emphasis on individual
freedom. First, artists should have
the right to produce whatever
type of art they wish. Second,
each person should have the
right to choose how to spend his
or her own money.

The fact is, America does not
need a government-operated
“Ministry of Culture.” Instead,
what we need is freedom.

Vegetarian Awareness Day focuses on animal rights

By Kim Palmiero

Local vendors interested in
spreading the message of
vegetarianism and animal rights
offered products ranging from
meatless hot dogs to vegetarian

“We want to make people

THE PUT NEWS, Monday, March 18, 1991

BAS

Continued from page 3
Laing, “It is in places like the
Student Government Board, the
Pitt Program Council and The
Pitt News.

“If blacks spread out and
become more involved in
various power levels at the
university, BAS will ultimately
be able to become more
powerful," he said.

Laing said BAS needs a black-
power committee that consists
of trustees, faculty, administra-
tion and students.

“We need to add certain
committees that deal with the
[inlefficiencies of '91 that might
not have been so great in ’69
when BAS was created,” Liang
said.

According to Laing, blacks at
Pitt today are facing issues that
their brothers and sisters faced
in the early 705.

‘‘We are fighting for the same
things they fought for,” he said.
“That’s crazy. lt’s been 20 years,
and we are doing the exact
same thing they did. See, that is

because no one has set up a
plan that goes beyond the term
of that person trying to set up
whatever they want to do.”

Effinger began her speech
by quoting from the preamble
to the BAS constitution: “No
matter how far a stream flows,
it never forgets its source.”

Effinger would like to see
BAS interact more with the
community.

“Whatever I obtain during
my stay here is because of the
guidance given to me by the
black community,” Effinger
said. “BAS, not just the
community-outreach commit-
tee, needs to go out into the
community to give back to
them as well,” Effinger said.

In her speech, Effinger
presented seven principles for
the future development of BAS
and her own self-improve me nt.

Effinger defined her first
point, which became the basis
for the other six: ‘‘I must have
faith in myself, in BAS, in the
black students, that we can

improve the self in the masses."

Effinger would like to see
black students unite through
responsibility. “I believe in
purpose, that I  we have
responsibilities as black
students to make things better,”
she said.

Effinger would like to see
BAS control its own resources.

“Right now SG B is controlling
[resources]. If we could control
the money that is coming to us,
then we can control the pro-
grams we do for the black stu-
dents here at Pitt,” Efﬁnger said.

Effinger seeks self-
determination.

“No matter how many times
I am told that there isn’t a
struggle, that there isn’t a
problem for the black students
at Pitt, I must ignore it and go
on and do the work that needs
to be done,” Effinger said.

Elections take place from 10
am. to 6 p.m. today in the
Towers Lobby and the William
Pitt Union concourse. Only BAS
members can vote with valid.

information that coincided with
the information SLAR had at its
table.

There was also food and
entertainment to go along with
the information booths.

Mark Ginsburg, a professor at
Pitt, organized the Peace and
Justice Fair to promote interaction
among groups with similar
interests.

“The fair is an attempt to bring
together a variety of different
groups. Whether it’s a question
of equal rights, racism, the
environment  the idea is to
bring them together and, in a
sense, have a festival,” said
Ginsburg.

He said that the conference
was a way “to get community
groups [to] interact with the
people who are coming in for the
conference.” The conference that
he is referring to is The
Comparative and International
Education Society’s annual
conference was held at the same
time as the fair.

They were particularly interested

Hoover had worked with the

Pitt Hoops: Failed expectations or due justice?

LOUISVILLE, Ky. —Thanks to the Georgia Bulldogs,
the Pitt Panthers were able to see second-round action
in the 1991 NCAA Tournament. And thanks to the
Kansas jayhawks, the closest Pitt will get to Charlotte,
.\'.C., this year will be a satellite hookup.

Carrying the tag of “underachievers” while dealing
with the ramifications of not meeting preseason
expectations has taken its toll on a young group of
athletes who, for some reason, may have never really
believed in their hearts the heights to which they were
projected to go at the start of the year.

Winning the Big East Conference outright and going
deep into the NCAA Tournament were just two such
predictions. Well, they did neither.

“This is definitely not a fitting end [to our season].
We won one NCAA [Tournament] game and I think our
team is capable of winning more," said Darren
Morningstar.

WRONG. Losing in the second round of the
tournament is more than a fitting end to a team which,
when it had its ups, was way up, compiling a 21-12
record with highlights including knocking off Syracuse
at home and Georgetown at the Capital Centre.

But otherwise, the Panthers were an average team

I.()lTlS\'Il.l.l’., Ky. — As
reporters entered the Pitt
locker room shortly after the
Panthers were ousted from
the .\'(ZAA Tournament by
Kansas last Saturday, a soda
can opened. The noise
sounded like a gunshot in the
silence, however, as the
players sat quietly slumped in
their chairs.

The Panthers had just failed
in the .\'(IAA second round for
the third time in live Years,
and the playing days of Pitt’s
four seniors had been
extinguished by the jayhawks,
77-66.

“We feel bad about losing,

There wasn’t much else to
say.

with fair perimeter shooting anda center who has lost the
chance to ever perform up to his capabilities.

To add even more tragedy to the story, Brian Shorter,
once considered the best inside man in the Big East
Conference, showed only faint sparks of his formerly
consistent brilliance and is now only a distant pro
prospect.

Shorter managed a mere six points in Pitt's 77-66 loss
to thejayhawks and pulled down a scant three rebounds.
Guard Sean Miller, at 6 feet, was able to grab four boards.
In that game, Pitt was out-rebounded 37-27 and shot only
38.2 percent from the field.

However, the Jayhawks committed 1S turnovers, while

Pitt chalked up eight steals. The Panthers could do
next to nothing with the opportunities presented to
them. They failed to score on fast breaks, had trouble
on the perimeter and could not get the ball inside.

“We had a lot of high expectations for the guys
returning, and it didn't work out,” Miller said. “But we
won 21 games, and we got to the second round of the
I\'CAAs. Kansas was a better team, and you don't feel
as bad when you get beat like that compared to the
Big East Tournament, when Seton Hall hit a buzzer
shot on us. Now, that feels bad."

Pitt was lucky to even get to the second round,
thanks to the ice-cold free—throw shooting of the
Georgia Bulldogs. The Dogs went zero for six at the
line and managed only one field goal in five minutes
of overtime. Rod Cole may have not even scored that
one field goal if it weren’t for Shorter and Martin giving
him an open lane to the hoop.

Cole's drive to the basket much resembled Oliver
Taylor's last-second basket for Seton Hall in the Big
East Tournament to knock Pitt out in the first round.
It seems as ifan opponent wants to score against Pitt,
all it has to do is send a man straight down the paint,

Tim Glover's (left) hustle and Darelle Porter's seven points were not quite enough to propel Pitt past the second round.

Covering the tourney from East to West and in between

A few random thoughts on this
weekend's NCAA action, starting in the
East Regional:

°Oklahoma State looked impressive in
its two wins over New Mexico and NC
State. Byron Houston andjohnny Pittman
are an impressive duo inside. This is the
only team that might give North Carolina
a speck of trouble. Still, I’ll bet that some
Indianapolis hotel already has a reservation
for a D. Smith.

-Speaking of the Tar Heels, can it get
any easier? Eastern Michigan? George
Lynch and Rick Fox have been the

mainstays for the No. 1 seed. The fact that ’

they also go 10 or 11 deep doesn't hurt,
but it’s the shooting ability of Fox and the
rebounding of Lynch that will carry this
team to Indy.

-Syracuse and UCLA might do well to
watch a few films of their opponents
before they play them. Both squads
seemingly failed to recognize and adapt to
Richmond's and Penn State’s style of ball
control and defensive pressure. Jim
Boeheim has to be the worst game coach
ever. UCLA Coach Jim Harrick has to be
really confused, but he is still a good
coach.

In the West action 

Derek
\Villis

-Seriously expecting Georgetown’s
freshmen backcourt to handle UNLV’s
pressure turned out to be a sad joke. Vegas
is just too active, too quick and too
relentless. And, as Elmore Spencer proved,
they do have a bench.

-Come to think of it, G’town-Vanderbilt
was another good game. Scott Draud of
Vandy has to have the worst hair style in

the tournament. He can really shoot,
though.

Turning to the Midwest 

0 Duke is looking as good as it did in the
early rounds a year ago. Even a possible
matchup with Ohio State won’t slow the
Blue Devils down. But rest assured that
U.\'L\-’ will once again have lots offun with
Duke. If I were Bobby Hurley, that would
be a good time to get sick again. H

-I hope everyone caught some ofjamal
Faulkner's performance against Arkansas
yesterday. The Arizona State freshman
ripped the Razorbacks with 29 points and

feet away to gasps of disbelief
from the crowd.

Good thing Glover was
successful out there. If the frosh
had any less success, Pitt may
have left Louisville even earlier.

Glover single~handedly got the
Panthers back into the game with

  

his four netters, as Pitt led by one
at 59-58 with just over six minutes
to go in the second half.

“I don’t know who he was —
No. 12 lGloverl,” said Georgia’s
three-point counter—ace Jody
Patton.

Well, at least it’s a good thing
that a freshman whom no one
has ever heard of, with no
tournament experience and 12
shots to his credit for the entire
31-game season, came in and
held the Panthers together.

Somehow that seems like a job
for the veterans: Martin, Shorter,
Miller, Jason Matthews and
Darelle Porter — Pitt’s most
heralded recruiting class.

But somehow it seems like
cruel justice in a season of failed
expectations, a season of the
backcourt and the frontcourt
taking their turns at having an
“off night.”

A season of Shorter showing
signs of the power forward ofold
and Martin showing his usual
consistent sign of unrealized
potential.

A season of Miller and Matthews
trying to pick up the slack when
the other was “off” from the
outside.

A season which culminated in
an untested freshman becoming
the hero of Pitt’s final win of the
season, while the national media
were still trying to figure out just
who the heck this guy was and
where he came from all of a
sudden.

A season which has ended with
the same old phrase.

”lhere’s always next year.

Pens send Rangers tumbling to sixth straight loss, 52

By Brian Berger
Sta_ﬂ' Writer

The matchup couldn’t have
been painted better by Picasso:
Sunday afternoon hockey in New
York on St. Patrick's Day. At
stake was first place in the Patrick
Division, :1 plateau that the
Pittsburgh Penguins have been
striving to reach for years. The
Rangers, however, have occupied
the throne all year long, a feat
that has led some to talk about
possibilities of a sighting of Lord
Stanley back in the Apple.

Quell those nightmares for the
time being. Our dashing heroes
in black sent the Rangers reeling
to their sixth straight loss and
now have some folks talking
instead about a Ranger choke.
It was 52 when the final horn

jeopardy of losing 21 Patrick playoff
spot had thrust into the division
lead with only seven games
remaining.

The Pens mark is now 38-306,
and general manager Craig Patrick
and Coach Bobjohnson have the
Penguins playing the best puck
that Pittsburgh has ever seen. It’s
ironic that Hartford GM and
former Pen f ront-office boss Eddie
Johnston deserves a hand in the
Pens recent surge by shipping
them the right ingredients for the
stretch run. He may yet win the
cup for Pittsburgh.

Back to reality and game action
from Madison Square Garden (or
MSG, depending on how the
Rangers are playing), where Mark
jansenns opened the scoring for

New York as Penguin goaltender
Tom Barrasso’s clearing pass was
intercepted by Jansenns, who
slid into the empty cage for his
ninth goal of the year.

The Rangers came out smokin’
early, and it wasn’t until the Pens
killed a penalty (something they
hadn’t been doing with any
success on the road all year) that
they woke up and realized that it
wasn’t Quebec again.

Kevin Stevens continued his
torrid pace of late by tipping in a
Paul Coffey blast for his 34th goal
of the campaign. Then Mario
Lemieux found the net on a partial
breakaway as the puck slid by
Mike Richter, and the Pens lead
2-] after one period.

Mike Gartner opened the
scoring of the second frame by
deeking Barrasso on the
backhand for his 43rd goal. The
Pens retaliated as Kevin Stevens

Finally, Longhorns Coach Tom

redemption.

However, the Huskies’ offense is
so predictable that the rematch

Bluejays came through against
New Mexico State, but leave it to
Seton Hall to ruin things. I have
to admit, though, that the Hall’s
defense is getting even better.
-The best defensive
performance in the first two
rounds has to belong to Indiana.
Down 3832 to Florida State at

the half, the Hoosiers limited the
Seminoles to one basket in the
first eight minutes of the second
half. That performance reminded
me of the defensive clinic put on
by Georgetown in their 1983
semifinal win over Kentucky,
where the Hoyas allowed
Kentucky to shoot nine percent
in the second half.

got his second power-play goal
of the game, again off a Coffey
rocket.

Ranger goon Joey Kocur got
five minutes for spearing ljlf
Samuelsson, and the deadly
Penguin power-playunitwent to
work again. Mario Lemieux put
home a Stevens shot fora 4-2 Pen
lead after a deuce.

The Rangers couldn’t put
anything past Barrasso in the
third, much of it due to the Pens’
newly realized defensive play.
Phil Borque scored an empty
netter, and Pittsburgh was in first
place in the division this late in
the season for the first time in an
iceage.

How important is Paul Coffey
to the Penguins? Consider this
stat: of the Pens’ 82 power-play
goals, Coffey has been on the ice
for 73. While Coffey remains a
liability at times, defensively, he

remains the catalyst on the man
advantage. Last week with Coffey
(and Larry Murphy) out, the Pens
struggled on the play, but since
his return the Pens have gone 5
for 8.

Pittsburgh is now 60-1 in their
last seven and has won 14 road
games this season — a club
record. This is clearly not the
same team that went 0—9-1 recently
on the road. It is reflected in the
standings and definitely on the
ice where the Pens have asserted
themselves as legitimate
contenders in March.

It’s a heat up as the Pens travel
to New jersey on Tuesday, then
return home Thursday for another
matchup with the Rangers. The
Penguins’ other remaining Patrick
games include a home and away
game with Philadelphia and the
regular season finale at the
Rangers two weeks from now.

Charlotte, no last hurrah for the

most talented recruiting class ever
to don the Blue and Gold.

The Panthers hit only 38 percent
oftheir field goals against a sticky
jayhawk defense, and the seniors
made only 12 of 36.

With a faint trace of the
“underachiever" label still
lingering in the air, the team
many experts picked in the Top
10 lost the Big East regular-season
title, a holiday tournament, a first-
round Big East Tournament game
and a second-round NCAA game.

For Bobby Martin, Darelle
Porter, Jason Matthews and
Shorter, it was an unmemorable
end for memorable careers. The
fifth member of that recruiting
class, Sean Miller, has another
year of eligibility left after being
redshirted last year.

With 5,672 points, 2,301

 

rebounds, 1,045 assists, 570 starts
and 74 wins in their book, the last
chapter in the careers of the four
seniors came to a quiet close at
Freedom Hall.

This year’s Pitt squad finished
21-12, but it will likely be
remembered as The Little Team
That Couldn’t — live up to
expectations, that is.

“Our goal was to go as far as we
can with the talent we have, and
I think we did that,” said Shorter.

‘‘I’m not disappointed. We won
21 games. We had a lot of tough
losses, but we had a lot of good
wins, too.

But with so much pressure
from fans and media, the team
seemingly pleased only itself.

“We’re not playing for the fans
or anyone else. We’re playing for
ourselves,” said Martin earlier this
year

‘‘I had a great career,” said

Matthews. “We all had a helluva
career. We left our mark on Pitt
basketball. ”

“When people think of Pitt
basketball, they’ll think of us,”
said Porter.

Years from now, when no one
remembers who Oliver Taylor
(Seton Hall), Terry Brown
(Kansas) or Ray Reed (Hawaii)
are or how they beat Pitt this
year, most of the Panther seniors
will recall only pleasant
memories.

“Yup, I’m real happy with
myself,” said Porter. “I had a
great career -—- 1,000 points, 600
assists, 450 rebounds and 100-
something steals. I got to go all
over the world. There were a lot
ofups and down, but it was fun.”

“I have most of the games on
tape. When I look back in a few
years, I think I will be happy with
my career,” said Shorter. “This
[year] is the farthest I’ve gotten in
the NCAAs, and it’s the most wins
I’ve had since I’ve been here.”

Not all the seniors are as
pleased, however. “It was
disappointing. We had a lot of
high hopes,” said Martin.
“Everything hasn’t gone the way
we wanted. We wanted to win
more games. We wanted to go
past the second round in the
NCAAs.”
