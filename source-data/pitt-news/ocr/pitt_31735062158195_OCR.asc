University Named to Conduct S

U. S. ‘Commissioner of Edu

-has announcedthat the University will conduct a nation-
wide survey to help ﬁnd and develop the country’s most tal-

ented high school students.
The federal government In

‘ million dollars to the project, with.the University providing

$75000. The four year study will9
involve about half a million stu-
dents, or ﬁve per cent of the stu-
dents in 1400 high schools.

Dr. ‘John C._ Flanagan, professor
of psychology ‘at the University
and director of the American In-
stitute for Research, will direct
the survey,

“The "overall purpose of the
project is to help educators de-
velop to the full our available
human resources’ in meeting
scientiﬁc, cultural, occupational,
and civic needs. The national
need for trained manpower em-
phasizes the importance of the
talent program,” Derthick said.‘

The students themselves will
provide information to enable
their schools to _determine the
kinds of talent th'ey have, their
career interests, their educational
plans, and the progress of their
education. ‘

Residents Say
Dorm Election
Results Illegal S

A petition has been signed

by two-thirds of the residents‘

of Schenley House question-
ing the legality of last semes-
ter’s Schenley House? elec-
tions._ — ~

The petition claims “that. the"

signershad no knowledge before-
hand of a meeting which was
held to renominate candidates for
the do_rmitory’s executive. At the
ﬁrst meeting, accordingﬁto Clar-
ence Peters,‘f president, many no-
minations’.-were made “in fun”
thus the second meeting was call-
\

ed.

The petitioners ‘ disagree with
Peters in connection with notice
for the second meeting. Peters
claims that 250 notices ‘Vere
distributed, while 159 residents
claim they had no konwledge
of it.

The petitioners say that the
name of John Faunce~was left off
the’ ballot for the office .of vice-
president. Peters claims however
that he was nominated only at
the first meeting and did not ap-
pea-r.at the second.

The executive was presented
’a" letter to sign which Peters‘
termed “an ultimatum?’ deline-
. ating the charges and asking for
representative government and
better. use of social account
funds. This ‘was rejected by the
executive, but, they agreed to
rectify many points in conten-
tion.

Rebel leaders— also point out
that 7 of the 9 on the Schenley
House Governing Board are
members of the same social or-

ganization. This bears no relev-_

ancy, say the executive.

The signers of the petition call-
ed for a new election the ﬁrst
three weeks of the spring sem-
ester. Since then, leaders of the
movement who include in their
number Stuart Debenham, Bob
Lehman, Gary Prinz, and John
Faunce, have modiﬁed their de-

Vmands to representative govern-

ment and an admission by the
“guilty” parties, the officers, that
illegal procedures were employ-
ed -in the_ election.

Peters, speaking. for the officers,
claims, “the whole thing’s ridic-
ulous. It’s very easy to get some-
one to sign a petition.”

OpenBi(l Available to Fill Quotas

Sorority formal rushing for over three‘ hundred fresh-
man and transfer women begins on Thursday, -Feb. 26.

These rushees have become prospective sorority women
by having passed through a semester of free association, by

compiling a satisfactory academic record, and by carrying

twelve credits or more.

A rushee being considered for
sorority membreship will have re-
ceived invitations for the rush
parties to be held on Thursday,
Feb. 26. A rushee should answer
all these invitations but accept
only two. One party will be held
from 6:45 to 8:15 p.m., the other
from 8:30 to 10 p.m. Thursday
evening. '

On Friday, Feb. 27, all rushees
should report to the Twelfth Floor
between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.
to pick up their invitations for the
Friday and Saturday night par-
ties. Only one party will be held
on each night from 7:30 to
p.m. _

Silence Period Enforced _

A rushee may accept invitations
for both nights, but they must be
from two different sororities. Fol.-
lowing the parties on Saturday
night a two-day silence period
will be observed.

During this time sorority girls
are pledged not to discuss sorori-
ties from 9:30 p.m. Saturday,
Feb. 28 to 7:30 p.m., Monday,
March 2. Silence period is ob-
served in order that rushees
may make their choice of sorori-
ty independently.

It also gives the individual sor-
orities time to decide which girls
they want to ﬁll their own quotas.
During silence period rushees may
expect the usual friendly greeting
fromsorority women who in turn
expect a similar response, but
there should not be any conver-
sation or prolonged discussion be-
tween the two.

All Must Report

On Monday, March 2, all rush-
ees must go to the Twelfth Floor
between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. to ﬁll
out a preferential ballot, which
includes directions for those who
wish to join a sorority and direc-
tions for those not wishing to join
a sorority.

Between 7:15 and 7:30 p.m.,
Monday, March 2, all rushees
should pick upthe bid from one
of their preferred. sororities on
the Twelfth Floor. From here
the rushee immediately goes to
the meeting place of her partic-
ular sorority as designated on
the invitation.

Any sorority not ﬁlling its quota

and wishing to invite a girl to

membership after rushing may do
so by open bidding. On a day des-
ignated by Panhellenic Council,
all invitations to membership for
girls being open bidare brought
to the Dean of W0me11’s office.
Rushees are notiﬁed to come to
the oﬁice to complete a preferent-
ial ballot.
Open Bidding Limited
The Ofﬁce of the Dean of Wom-
en then notiﬁes both sororities
and rushees of the results of the
bidding..All girls who were bid
during open bidding must meet
the regular eligibility require-
ments for sorority membership.
Every girl who accepts a sor-
ority bid must successfully pass
through an apprenticeship
known as the pledge period.
This period of training lasts
from six to eight weeks. During
this time she must prove her-
self worthy of the trust which
a sorority has conferred upon
her. by bidding her. V
During the pledge period the
sorority and pledge come to a
mutual understanding of the
other. If the pledge ﬁnds that her
choice has not been wise, the re-
lationship may be broken. How-

ever, this is very rare. It involves.

a penalty of the pledge being in-
eligible to join another sorority
for one calendar year.

The pledge period is also de-
voted to training the pledge in
the standards, ideals, history, and
organization of her sorority. When
the sorority is sure that the ideals
and honor of. the group can be
entrusted to the pledge, she is
then initiated into the sorority.

POVERTY CAN BE FUN

It  no disgrace to be poor. it is an error, but it is no disgrace.

So. if your purse is empty,-do not skulk and brood and hide
your head in shame. Stand tall. Admit your poverty. Admit it
freely and frankly andall kinds of good things will happen to
you. Take, for instance, the case of Blossom Sigafoos.

Blossom, an impecunious freshman at an Eastern girls’

i college,,was smart. as a whip and round as .a dumpling, and
scarcely a day went by when she didn’t get invited to a party
weekend at one of the nearby men’s schools. But Blossom never
accepted. She did not have the rail fare; she did not have the
clothes. Weekend after weekend, while her classmates went
frolicking, Blossom sat alone, saved from utter despair only by
her pack of Marlboros, for even an exchequer as slim as Blos-
som’s can afford the joys of Marlboro—joys far beyond their
paltry price: rich, mellow tobaccos, lovingly cured and care-
fully packed; a new improved ﬁlter tliat‘ works like a charm.

~ _ Croesus himself could not buy a better cigarette!

However, Marlboro’s most passionate admirers—a.mong
whose iiuinber I arnlpaid to count myself—would not claim‘
that Marlboro can entirely replace love and romance, and Blos-
som grew steadily inoroser.

~.»*'~»

 

. S Then one day came a phone call from an intelligent sopho-
more named Tom O’Slianter at a nearby men’s college. “B105;
som,” said Tom, “I wa.nt you to come down next week for the

\ barley festival, and I won’t take no for an answer}?
- .“No,”isaid Blossom. . _

‘_‘Foolisli girl,” said Tom gently. “I knowwliy you refuse me.
It is because you are poor, isn’t it?”« '

“Yes,” said Blossom. H ‘
_ . “I will send you ‘a railroad ticket,” said Tom. “Also a small
salami in case you get hungry on the train.’’.

“But I have nothing to wear,” said Blossom.

Tom replied, “I will send you one suit of cashmere, two
gowns of lace, three slacks of velvet, four shoes of calf, ﬁve socks
of nylon, and a partridge in a-pear tree.” ’ , . ' .

“That is most kind,” said Blossom, “but I fear I cannot.
dance and enjoy myself while back lioiiie my poor lame brother
Tiny Tim lies abed.’_’ — i ’ \

' “Send him ‘to Mayo Brothers and put“. it on my tab,” said
Tom. ' ’- _ _

“You are terribly decent,” said Blossom, “but I cannot come
to'you_r party because all the other girls at the party will be
from rich, distinguished families, and my father is but a humble
woodcutter.” ~ , I
2 “I will buy him Yosemite,” said Tom. _ I ' ,

‘:You have a great heart,” said Blossom. “Hold the phone
while I a_.sk.our wise and kindly old Dean of VVomen whether it
is proper for me to accept all these gifts.” ‘ '

She went forthwith and asked the Dean of Women, and
the Dean of Women la.id her wise and kindly old hand on

-,Blossom’s cheek and said, “Child, let not false pride rob you
of happiness. Accept these gifts from Tom.” ' .
_.“Lord love you, Wise and‘Ki'ndly,’.’ breathed Blossom, drop-'
ping grateful tears into the Dean’s reticule. “I must run and
tell Tom.” ‘ -7‘

“Yes, run,_ cliild,=l’ said the Dean, a smile wrinkling her wise

and kindly old eyes. “And ask him has he gotan older brother.”

The Middies, who now lead in

So close and yet so far was the story of the Panther
wrestlers as they went down to defeat for the ﬁrst time this

and for the second undefeated season in the sch6ol’s wrestling
history, the matmen ﬁnally bowed to Lehigh, 16-12.

with them. ‘ ’

John Christoff and 'Ron Rush ran;
theyttied for agﬁrst in the mile
and both placed in another event.

Vince -Wojnar also looked good in
it winning the 1,000 yard race.”

L;ommenting.on,the meet in the
early part of last week, Rees said

"a lot would depend on the depth

of the entire team and how many
second and_thirds the team\could
take. ' '

Although the thinclads took‘

7 six ﬁrsts, three seconds, and two

thirds, it wasn’t enough for the
Panthers to ﬁnish first. The
Panthers scored 38 points in the
triangular meet, but followed
Navy~and Maryland who scored

Thinklish translation: This _fellow reads
nothing but the phone book (numbers
‘ only). The only music he likes is loga-
’”rhythm—the only dessert he’ll eat is pi.
When it comes to smoking, he’s 100% for
Luckies. Enjoying the honest taste of ﬁne
‘ tobacco, he’s a fairly agreeable fellow.
But the second he misplaces a decimal (or
his Luckies), his ire multiplies. Label him
wrathematician . . . you’ve got his number!
