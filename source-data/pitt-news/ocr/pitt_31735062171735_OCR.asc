Ritts Elected AWS Head

Elections for Associated Wom-

Quo.Vadis were held Wednesday.

Winning the presidency of AWS
was Cathi Ritts, a junior. Ritts is
a member of Delta Zeta sorority,
serving as Rush chairman and
was on AWS Council this year.

Ritts looks forward to a year of
working with other organizations
on campus. “AWS is a program-
ming organization for all women
on campus,” Ritts stated. “Our

educational benefits for women on

Vrana, RA

by SUE HOENSTINE

John Vrana, director of Univer-
sity Housing, is presently being
criticized by some Resident As-
sistants (RA,’s) for failing to
communicate with them.

Last week a number of RAS re-
quested a meeting with Vrana to
discuss security, drug busts, ra-
cial relations, and 24 hour open
house. RA’s felt that the housing
office had not done enough to in-
form them of how to deal with

 

JOHN VRANA, Housing Director

these situations and wanted a
chance to air their complaints.

This was the first general ses-
sion that Vrana has had with all
the resident leaders since last

September. And before the fall
term began, Vrana had promised

to establish close communication
with his housing staff.

Along with hearing the RA’s
complaints at the Friday meeting,
Vrana announced it might be nec-
essary to assign roommates to

RA’s in Towers A and B next year.

The tradition of Lantern Night,
a ceremony for freshman wom-
en, will be continued, Ritts added.
“We’ll be working with Pan-Hel,
Women’s Housing Board, and
maybe more men's organizations.
I’d like to see several good pro-
grams a term that will appeal to
the majority of women in the Uni-
versity,” the president-elect con-
cluded.

Judy Kichi, first vice-presi-
dent-elect of AWS, voiced concern
for women who commute. “In the
past, AWS has tried to program
events in the afternoon as well as
in the evenings, to cut down on
transportation problems. We‘d
like to see more commuters in-
volved in AWS.”

Kichi added that AWS has had
advertising problems in the past.
“It’s difficult to publicize events
far enough in advance so that
women can plan to attend our pro-
grams. If we can advertise well,
I think we can get a good response

next year.‘ I

Also winning in AWS was Kai‘-
en Collins as second vice-presi-
dent, Alice Litwinowicz as record-
ing secretary, Sheila Larken as
corresponding secretary, and Les-
lie Ostroski as treasurer.

Representatives - at - large for
AWS will be Paulette Bakos, Mar-
guerite Conte, Lois Fundis, De-
borah Huffmeyer, Elizabeth Ju-
lian, Donna Librecht, Jackie
Schwartz, Jeanne Veres, Diane
Brown, Patricia Edwards, Diane
Holmquist, Kim Johnson, Donna

According to Vrana, the pro-
posal represented a possible
means of “l”economizing.” “After
settling the union contract were
going to have to save about
$600,000,” the housing director
stated. “Instead of increasing
room and board even more were
trying to keep the costs down for
resident students."

Vrana‘s new proposal was term-
ed an “outrage” by one RA who
regretted the reduction of his du-
ties from “a counselor to at best.
an effective policeman. We were-
n’t informed on the RA rooming
situation until the meeting,” the
floor counselor went on. “This
isn‘t the kind of communication

Lewis, Maureen O’Toole; Janice
Shaffer, and Nancy Zitko.

In the Pan Hel. contest, Mary
Jane Trunzo won for president.
Other winning officers were Don-
na Librecht for vice-president,
Mary Ann Tasz for secretary, and
Janice Haupt for treasurer.

Results of the Quo Vadis selec-
tion found Sharon Checchi win-
ning for president, Elaine Elder
for vice-president, Mary’ Grace
Miller for secretary, Lois Elder
for corresponding secretary, Tre-
va Rusiewicz for sheriff, Jeanne
Veres for historian-ritual chair-
man and Mary Jane McMullen for
treasurer.

’s Exchange Criticism

one has when one wants to estab-
lish rapport with his staff.”

Vrana admitted that communi-
cation could be improved. But he
also argued that it was difficult
to convey information on securi-
ty or union negotiations since
“things were happening so quick-
ly and there were so many parties
involved.”

A few RA’s have suggested an
RA grievance committee that
would meet regularly with the
housing office to discuss dormi-
tory problems. It‘ would consist of
three administrators, three RA’s
and one neutral party. Vrana
agreed to consider the proposal
and relate his decision to the RA‘s
by late February.

  Draft Reform Equity

  

Moot-UACM Head

by GUS AVRAKOTOS

With the present draft law ex-
piring on June 30, President Nix-
on, in a message to Congress, re-
quested a two-year extension of
induction authorization, along
with an end to student defer-
ments, divinity student exemp-
tions, and the establishment of a
uniform national call.

In a recent news release, Dr.
Curtis Tarr. director of Selective
Service, characterized Nixon’s
draft reforms “as the steps like-
liest to achieve real equity in our
nation’s draft system.”

Commenting on the news re-
lease, Ralph Halgopian, director
of Pittsburgh Draft Information
Services, located at the Universi-
ty and City Ministeries (UACM),
agrees that a certain degree of
equity exists in the proposed re-
froms, since all will be exposed to
the possibility of being drafted.
“But basically, President Nixon

is asking Congress to streamline I

the legal basis of current prac-
tices of ceilings, quotas, and state
directors borrowing men.”

“Presently, each month a ceil-
ing (number of men to be called)

is placed and draft boards call
people up to this limit. Now draft
boards will call people up to a cer-
tain Iottery number. lnequities
still exist, since some draft
boards have more men with low
numbers than other boards.”

The uniform national call would
amend the lottery system so that
all young men with the same Ran-
dom Sequence Number could be

called at the same time for induc- ,

tion. Halgopian stated, “It gives
him the official power to do what
he coulddo anyhow.”

An objection to the lottery sys-
temis that it reduces people from
a name to a number. “A few in-
equity can be seen to exist since
your obligation to your country
becomes based on a stroke of
luck,” he said. A

If Congress gives the President
what he is asking for, undergrad-
uates who are freshmen in col-
lege or younger after Sept. 1, 1970,
have no real student deferments.
“They will have a 2-S classifica-
tion, but with special notation,
meaning that they can be yanked
out of schoolat anytime,” Halgo-
pianstated. “The student defer-
ment will continue for all who

‘were sophomores past the effec-

tive date of September, 1970.

“Interestingly enough,” he con-
tinued, “ROTC students are spe-
cifically exempted from implica-
tions of the cancellations of stu-
dent deferment. Thus ROTC may
get a shot in the arm and burgeon

across the country with students

entering ROTC to be deferred dur-
ing their undergraduate years.

“If Nixon were really interest-
ed in an equitable draft he would
also ask to abolish 1-D classifica-
tions for ROTC students,” he de-
clared.

Halgopian pointed out that pre-
sently student and ministrial de-
ferments are Congressional
mandatory deferments written in
the Military Selective Service Act
of 1967. “Here Nixon is asking
Congress to relinquish their say
over the means of manpower pro-
curement and give him the right
to grant these deferments,” he
said. “Congress can meet his
requests or any combination of
his requests.

“Basically only two deferments
will be left to students (1) hard-

ship to dependents, and (2) con-
sciencentious objection. Paternity
and occupational deferments hav-
ing been discontinued since April
23.”

A misconception existing today
is that President Nixon is abolish-
ing the draft. Halgopian made
clear that the Selective Service
System is not being abolished but
is being geared to a “standby”
operation for processing regis-
trants.

“Nixon’s reforms are in keep-
ing with his target goal of a zero-
draft call by June, 1973,” he said,
“not the same thing as abolishing
the draft. In fact, anytime the ad-
ministration feels necessary to
call inductees to supplement the
military, it will have the power
to do so without consulting Con-

gress.

Halgopian went on to explain
that the President’s proposed
draft reforms may not evolve en-
tirely from his efforts to equalize
the military. “Obviously the tar-
get date of June, ’73, is still close
enough to Nov., 1972, so by the
time of the Presidential cam-
paign these promises and at-

tempts at reform will have a good»

deal of impact on the election.

Another side effect of taking
away student deferments was cit-
ed by Halgopian. “With the in-
crease of the 1-A classification
there will be less of a need to go
into the high lottery numbers;
thus less people will be inclined to

’ join resistance movements. Only

those with low numbers will be
affected by lottery and less peo-

ple will have the motivation to

resist.”

 Chancellorﬂeviews

by BOB BONN
Assistant News Editor

(Editor's Note: The following is a summary
of Part Three of the Chancellor's Report on the
Store of the University.) '

Section Three of the Chancel-
lor’s report centered on Academic
reviews of each of the schools of
the University.

The report begins with the Fac-
ulty of Arts and Sciences (FAS),
stating that it 'is the largest fac-
ulty -of the University, including
undergraduate programs through
the College of Arts and Sciences
(CAS), as well as graduate pro-
grams.

During the past year, the most
dramatic change in the FAS was
the establishment of interdisci-
plinary courses, merging depart-

. mental areas to expand tradition-

al studies.
Instruction in Black Studies be-

. gan last year. Starting with six

full-time faculty members, the de-
partment has offered many new
courses, including language in-
struction in Swahili and Yoruba.
Additionally, proposals for ex-
change programs have been made
with institutions in East and West
Africa, both for students and fac-
ulty.

A comparative
gram began last year, including

literature pro— --

   

members from different depart-
ments. Interdisplinary pro-
grams were also started in the
areas of religion and Asian
studies. '

Research continued on a high ’

level in FAS last year, particular-
ly in the departments of Physics,
Chemistry, and Crystallography.

Additionally, many of the‘ FAS
departments have embarked on
broad new programs or have ac-
quired new electronic equipment
for study, such as the multi-track
language labs and the music de-
partment’s electronic studio.

The Citizenship Information
Center (CIC) was also establish-
ed last year, to acquire and dis-
seminate information of a politi-
cal nature. The CIC is also serv-

ing as a resource center for poli- V

tical research.

CAS

In the College, the credit-no en-
try system was instituted last
year. With this option, students
receive an  for satisfactory
work, but if their work is less than
satisfactory, no entry is made on
their transcript. Students must
choose well in advance which
grading system they wish to take.
So far, about 10 to 15 per cent of
the courses taken in CAS have

National Black History Week

Black Business Highlighted

by SHELLEY L. HOOE

In commemoration of National
Black History Week, Feb. 8-12,
the Hill Education Project colla-
borated with Alpha Kappa Alpha
Sorority, Inc., to present several
programs in the Student Union
Ballroom. The programs held
Monday and Wednesday and
scheduled for tonight are in rec-
ognition of the basis for Black
freedom—the Black business.

On Monday, Dwelling House. a
Black building and loan associa-
tion, was the focal point.

Robert Lavelle, executive di-
rector of Dwelling House, speak-
ing on the purpose of the associa-

tion, said, “I see us rebuilding‘

Pittsburgh. I see us getting
Blacks to continue in school, to
get jobs, to pay taxes, to save
money, to buy houses that a white
association might consider too
broken—down to risk money on.” —

In recognition of the fact that
the law_is the basis for establish-
ing everything, the sponsoring
groups included on their Monday
agenda Ronald Davenport, dean
of the Duquesne Law School and a
graduate of Temple University
Law School, and Cecil Banks and

Clifford Cooper, both first-year.

law students at Pitt.

The students spoke on the his-
tory of law as an instrument util-
ized by the Black community.

While pointing out that the white
man has systematically kept
Blacks out of the law profession,
Cooper stated that Black people
haven’t really used the law be-
cause they simply don’t know it.
He continued that the law is for
poor people, implemented by the
rich to uphold their status posi-
tions.

Banks emphasized the impor-
tance of Blacks being educated,
stating, “Going to school isn’t al-
lowing yourself to. be manipulated
by the system. It is learning the
system so as to be able to mani-
pulate it.” -

Davenport emphasized to the
sparse Black audience, “If you’re
serious about being dedicated to
the nation, instead of clenching
your fist and saying, ‘Right-on,
Brother,’ first get yourself to-
gether.”

The 33-year-old black dean
pointed out that it takes more
strength to hold one’s emotions
and go to school at the risk‘ of be-
ing labeled an Uncle Tom. He
continued that Booker T. Wash-
ington, one of the most prominent
“Uncle Toms” in Black history,
was the first Black president of a
Black institution.

“While Howard and Fisk
were teaching Blacks Greek and
Latin and ‘ex-house niggers’ were
reading poetry to each other un-

The language requirement has
been dropped in CAS, although
students are still strongly urged
to take languages. Although the
requirement is no longer in ef-
fect, “the actual/number of lan-
guages courses offered by the
University has increased, with
many more less-commonly-
taught languages now available.”

ENGINEERING
“In keeping with its view that
engineers should be sensitive to
the impact of‘ technology on so-

social science courses last year,”
according to the report. These in-
cluded studies in History, Politi-
cal Science, and Sociology.

Two major programs which be-
gan in the Engineering School lead
to new degrees. The Bachelor of
Engineering Technology Degree
took shape at the Johnstown cam-
pus, supplementing the more sci-
entifically-oriented programs at
the Oakland campus.

And the new program for the
Doctorate in Engineering includes
a new requirement that the stu-
dent’s thesis be based upon a long
industrial experience instead of
a more traditional research pro-
ject.

er T. Washington was teaching
Blacks industrial -and technical
skills-—skills that Black people
could use to help themselves, he
commented.

Davenport told his listeners,
“The Black man can't jive the
man out of anything that counts.
He must take it--by being better
than he is, smarter than he is,
more dedicated than he is-the
name of the game is winning.’.’

The evening was concluded with
a musical performance by the
Sounds of Ebony. Donations were
collected for Ille Ellegba, Pitts-
burgh’s drug rehabilitation cen-
ter.

Wednesday Alpha Kappa Alpha
Sorority, Inc., and the Hill Edu-
cation Project offered the Stu-
dent Union Ballroom to any Black
businessmen interested in par-
ticipating in a Black Market Night.

The purpose of the evening was
to give Black businessmen a
chance to set up a display to ad-
vertise their wares and to an-
swer questions.

Friday evening is open to young
people in the Black community
who wish to demonstrate any par-
ticular talent in the “Youth in
Service to the Nation” program.

Academics

Research programs tackled by
engineering faculty during 1969-
70 included problems in develop-
ing an implantable artificial
heart, investigation of brain,
skull, and neck damage in auto
accidents, and a study of hospital
real-time costs.

Enrollment in the Engineering
School can be increased this year,
as the new Benedum Hall is

- scheduled for completion in July.

EDUCATION AND LAW

The School of Education is ex-
tremely influential in the number
of teachers it produces for the
state, particularly in the Pitts-
burgh area. In the Common-
wealth, 45 per cent of the school
systems are headed by Pitt alum-
n1.

Last year, the Educational
Placement Office placed nearly
300 preschool, elementary, and
secondary teachers, as well as
many more who went into admin-
istrative programs, college

GENERAL STUDIES
“The School of General Studies
offers undergraduate education-

al degree programs primarily for -

the mature student who typically
is employed full—time and attends
the University part-time in the
evening,” according to the report.

A search committee is now
seeking a replacement for Viers
W. Adams, who retired last year.
New in the school is the appoint-
ment of a black adviser to the ad-
visory staff to help minority stu-
dents;‘an alumni association has
been formed.

Two new majors were added
last year, in anthropology and bio-
logy. Some 40 new courses were
added altogether. Faculty im-
provements were also numerous,
using many of the University’s
full-time faculty.

 Proiogu e   Epi I og us?

by PAULG. VENTURA
The best laid plans 0’ mice and man oft go ugly. It is not too

difficult to see that the situation brought on by Pitt's latest attempt

at academic innovation is not an altogether handsome one.

The proposed Prologue Program was (and is) destined for non-
acceptance and infeasibility. a bastard child in an educational system
itself having questionable legitimacy. Like the Independent Study
program. the Prologue seems ill-suited to cope with the real dangers
of the-archaic, systematized learning (7) which is now perverting
the concept of "education.“

But this failure is NOT because of am inherent imperfections
in Independent Study or Prologue so much as it is due _to the flaws
in the context to which they hope to be admitted.

As it stands. even should the programs BE accepted and opera-
tive. (as Independent Study appears to be). they will at best serve
only as an ESCAPE from the present system (ie. with its majors.
required courses, ABCDE-minded grading, etc.) and not as an integ-
ral PART OF curriculum. Ultimately. this is what Prologue and In-
dependent Study MUST become. and the following questions may
exemplify why they haven‘t:

1) Does independent study fulfill any major requirements or
even carry much weight towards any major?

2) Where does Prologue stand
Studies?

3) What happens to the Prologue student following his ex-
perieice in that plan? Doesn’t Prologue only postpone- or soften the
blows of the present chaos, without attaining the necessary perpetu-
ation? .

in light of Distribution-of-

4) How many science courses are available on a Credit-No
Entry basis to science majors? How will independent study benefit
them? Doesn’t independent study, if not offered fully to both liber-
al arts students and science students, put a hole in the idea of a
“College of Arts and Sciences” which should ideally discourage
the growing rift between the “Two Cultures?”

Countless other questions can be uncovered but they all point
to the same realization: that educational progress must be a com-
plete process, that it must involve itself either within or against
the “old system" not try to grow under its-feet.

This is not to say that this needn’t be done gradually—Rome
didn‘t fall in a day—for' the “new education” needs not only the
strength to topple its opponents but additionally the power to main-
tain permanence.

The present plans for independent study provide it with neith- ’

er. And without proper equipment is it right to subject innovation
to an untamed wasteland, thereby consigning it to a premature‘
burial?

Prologue is still in the phase of conceptionfto try to force it
into the current educational curriculum would be nothing less than
careless abortion.

What must be done to integrate the independent study pro-
grams into the present system is obvious, but the job has thus far
been neglected. Either major requirements, standard grading, etc.
must be modified (or eliminated) to accommodate independent study
OR independent study must becomea REQUIRED program, if not
at least a fully creditable alternative to academic requirements and
not just a regrettably terminal vacation from them. A

Unless something along. these lines is done in preparing new
proposals——and eventually molding the university as a whole—the
gears which drive education will not mesh and the transmission of
ideas cannot occur.

Pitt Fans
Defeat Team

Editor: The Pitt News,

I am a senior and until com-
ing to Pitt, had never seen a stu-
dent body hinder the perfor-
mances of their teams. Pitt has
a good basketball team. They
work hard together and support
each other on the floor.

They need to support each
other because a few of the fans
have taken upon themselves the

demoralization of their team. I I

have attended four home games,
three of which were hindered
by objects thrown on the floor.
This last game may have been
lost as a result of such action.
W.V.U. scored two points on
technical foul shots and control-
led the ball when it was put
back into play after each techni-
cal foul leading to four more
points, a total of six points.

The game was lost by five.
My object is not to give the team
a cop out excuse. They don’t
need it nor would I suspect
that they want it. The object is
the reasonibility of the students
to their team.

There were students seated all
around the area from which the
garbage was projected onto the
playing floor. Whether or not it
was actually a student that per-
petrated such an act is irrele-
vant. What is important is that

no one tried to stop the one.

responsible.

It’s like sitting with the ignor-
ant groundlings of the Elizabe-
than era. If the action gets too
slow or someone doesn’t like
something, he throws out a rot-
ten vegetable. Maybe it will hit
someone or someone will fall
and it will be worth a good
laugh.

I W /-

This, however, is not the
Elizabethan Era. Culture has
supposedly advanced. The code
of youth is respect for every

living thing yet we don’t even

show enough respect for our-
selves to support our team by
controlling the morons in our
midst. The team deserves our
apology. They give us the best
game they can and we throw
them a rotten banana. Rather un-
fair? Next time let’s throw out
the man with the vegetables
and watch the team we support‘
play to win.

Kent Stater
Maligned

Editor, The Pitt News,

After reading your comments
on the fall quarter Daily Kent
Stater. (January 15) I was- left
wondering why you hadn’t
bothered to read the paper be-
fore commenting on it.

“One paper used the entire
front page and editorial page to
reprocussions (sic) on the inci-
dent (May 4),” the unidentified
Pitt writer said. What issue was
that? We did run an extra when
the indictments were issued and
fully one-half of that four-page
issue discussed other news.

We had a “Perspective,” our
four-page magazine supplement,
on May 4, but that section also
discussed housing, women’s lib
and a variety of other topics.

There was no issue that de-
voted the entire front page to
May‘ 4. And, even if we had
thought of doing it, why would
it be wrong? Wasn’t Keng State
the scene of the ‘shootings?
Aren’t the political and verbal
complications still affecting
KSU students? Don’t they have
a right to know about those

things affecting them? M
Then, your ultimate com-
plaint, we devoted 12 to 16

pages on “news and editorials.”
Is there any reason no one men-

tioned that only two of those,

“12 to 16 pages” went to edi-
torials?

C

  
  
  

As for news, I thought news-
papers were supposed to run
news——or have you thought up a
new definition? Only two col-
ums — maximum 28 inches of
writing, 102 lines of type, ever
went toward expressing Stater
opinion; the rest of the opinion
comes from our readers.

*\A
V

O.»  

Last year, the Stater, accord-
ing to the Associated press rat-
ing_service, was the number one
college newspaper in the coun-
try. That came through layout,
photography and writing——all of
which you ignored in your analy-
sis, all of which improved this
year.

Your headline on Campus edi-
tor Sherrie Salyer’s story (page
7) wasn’t even correct: only 23
have been arrested for spring
activities here; 19 at the time of
the story.

And, just so you could do a
complete job of misrepresenta-
tion, you mailed the copy of
The Pitt News to an address
The Stater vacated four years
ago.

 

Sincerely,
William Lazarus
Fall quarter editor, DKS

CC Jews Unite

‘ Editor, The Pitt News:

   

The trials of Jews in the Sovi-
et Union. conducted under the
pretext of their Zionist and anti-
Soviet activities, and the long
term sentences, including slow
death through starvation, meted
out, are symbolic of the wave of
terror and anti-Semitism now at
large throughout the Commun-
i-st world.

Jews are again held hostage.
by a totalitarian power, and pro-
secuted and tortured as ene-
mies of the country, while the
world watches silently. But un-

like 30 years ago when similar

actions presaged the beginning
of a mass Jewish extermination,
the world now can no longer
claim that it had no knowledge
of these crimes.

Since it is generally felt that

these persecutions would not
be taking place today were the
public opinion climate not
thought to be receptive to the
idea of a new Jewish blood
bath, it is important that those
who want to prevent it speak
out NOW. I

A small group of survivors of —
the Nazi death camps, Ausch-

witz and Buchenwald, is taking
this step to ask the intellectu-
als, leaders and writers, the
professors, the students and the
media, all those who on so many
occasions protested the oppres-
sion of different peoples, to
break, their silence now.

  Quinque’s:

by RICHARD LEAVY
“Cheech!”
“Hey, Jerry. Chuck. . . . There’s someone miss-
mg.” .
“Yeah, Smitty’s sick or something."

, At Quinque’s Restaurant. Cheech knows every-
one because everyone is a regular in the first ten
minutes. Ernest Quinque, who by some mysterious
process pronounces his name as “Cheechee” is the
proprietor of a restaurant and bar.

/The place is an institution for hundreds of Pitt
students, and, unfortunately, it is a doomed insti-
tution. After eight years of serving the finest
hoagies and meatball-and-cheeses anywhere, the
_, expansion of the University will force the closing
of Quinque’s.

SINCERITY, EFFICIENCY, AND Jimmy Breslin face not-
withstanding, Ernest Quinque will soon be forced to
close his restaurant to make way for University ex-

' pansion. Photo by Bob Donaldson

Quaint But Quitting

But there is a lot more than food at Cheech’s
place. There is a bit of warmth and congeniality
there that you can’t get at a fast-service hamburger
shop. Cheech takes your order on a white pad, and
he writes‘ out what you‘ want (no pre-printed slip for
circling “cheeseburger-coke”). And if he doesn‘t
know your name, he'll ask it and remember it for
some time.

Cheech, a stocky man in a white apron with a
face resembling Jim Breslin’s, stomps back and
forth along the counter—-from cash register to grille
—a constant motion and sound.

That’s an important. part of Quinque’s--the
sound: sounds blending together with the smell of
Bud and Cheech’s meatball sauce; the sounds of the
juke box playing Black Magic Woman or I Didn't
Know What Time It Was, punctuated with Cheech’s
fast laugh and a booming, “Yo, Jack! Your hoagie’s
ready” into the adjoining room.

Quinque’s brings in an amazingly assorted cli-
entele: dent school students, coeds, freaky looking
kids and straights, furniture movers, cops, and
executives. For everyone there is a “hello” at the
door, a “here you go” when served,,and a “thanks,
Jim" when you pay. You pay after you’ve eaten,
and there is no check—it’s a small thing, but you
sense a feelingof trust.

The whole operation is a small one, but Cheech
manages to serve a goodly number of customers
during the noon-hour rush. At about 12:30, it’s hard
to find an empty stool or chair. But somehow you

feel as though you can sit and gab a while after (

you've eaten.

A friend of mine once tried to eat a hamburger,
fries, and a coke leisurely at a nearby shop. With
some difficulty, he stretched it out to 15 min-
utes. At Cheech’s there is no crush of time, and
lunch can take as long as you like.

It is all going. According to Cheech, the Univer-
sity gave notice that he was to close in late Septem-

IFC Board Seeks

Image Improvement

by JANE HENDERSON

Improvement of the Greek system’s image will be the main objec-
tive of the new executive board of the Inter-fraternity Council (IFC).
The newly-elected officials are president, Paul Symczak; internal vice-
president, Bob Ventura; external vice—president, Bob Stack; secretary,
Dave Tutko; and treasurer, Rich Josselson.

Reappraisal of IFC’s role as a Greek governing body and forma-
tion of new goals was the purpose of the annual Presidents’ Retreat held
last weekend for all Pitt fraternity presidents. Three primary goals
that were set up for the coming year are participation, unification, and
expansion of the Greek system.

“The main point,” said Dave Tutko, secretary, “is that thenew
executives hope they can channel this great potential to benefit the sys-
tem and the student body as a whole. There is a great potential here be-
cause of the tremendous size of the group."

V In an effort to change unfavorable impressions of Greeks, the
board IS in the process of setting up, through the external vice-presi-

dent, a public relations program.

“We are attempting to reorganize in the interior to stimulate in-
volvement outside the Greek system,” explained Paul Symczak, pres-
ident. “With the size of this group, we can unify to work for needed
changes." -

Past efforts to activate the Greeks have included Greek Week;
service projects, including Heart Fund, Children‘s Hospital, and Blood
Bank drives; and, most recently, work on the Fall Term’s course eval-

-uation booklets, done in conjunction with Pan Hel and Student Gov-
ernment. '

STUDENT LOBBY

The Portable Farina

by TOM NETTER

Like Up To Me, Dell, $ .75

A Long Time Coming and a
Long Time Gone, Dell, $ .95
(Raped
Richard Farina was a novelist.

poet. lyricist, and expatriate. He
married the sister of Joan Baez,
fought in the hills of Cuba. and
wrote about the pubs in Ireland.
He died in a motorcycle acci-
dent at the age of 29. two days
after the publication of his first
and only full length novel,Been
down so long it looks like up to
me.

The novel is the story of Gnos-
sos Pappidapolos, a wandering,
insane all around cool-guy who
drops in and out of college,
smokes Pall Malls soaked in
paragoric, carries a rucksack
full of silver dollars he won in
Las Vegas, drinks like a maniac,
smokes like a fiend, and reads
Winnie the Pooh.

He drops into a college on the
east coast, finds the campus
in_a turmoil over women in
men’s,’apartments and, in gen-
eral, lives an outrageously in-
sane and un-fettered life.

CHARACTERS
WITH ODD QUIRKS
Gnossos is surrounded by
characters who have odd
quirks:

The leader of the student re-
bellion is named Ouef. He lives
in a room in a mental hospital,
has a nurse-servant who brings
him drinks and takes dictation.

The college newspaper editor,
Youngblood, receives much of

his editorial substance from
Ouef.
Gnossos’ girl, Kristin, wears

green knee-socks. She appears
to be as pure as the driven
snow, but winds up getting the
clap from Ouef and giving it
to Gnossos. In one scene she
thinks she -is being attacked by
a monstrous, imaginary monkey.

Gnossos’ very good friend
Hef is going with a dyke named
Jack who continually stares at
the chest of another co-conspira-
tor, Judy Lumpers. The list
could continue, but the rest are
obvious. People are strange.

PUTTING IT ALL
TOGETHER

Well, put it all together. and
you find that Gnosos leaves for
Cuba with his friends, meets
some sort of ominous dope con-
nection named Buddha, and re-
turns to the college.

He finds it in turmoil, as a
demonstration in progress. He

is asked to give a speech, but
instead stands in front of the
crowd and gives it the finger.
Well, in this place anything
goes, and they love it. and in a
moment they go storming off to
destroy the house of the presi-
dent of the college.

To make a long story short,
Oeuf winds up at the headof
the college, and Gnossos winds
up getting drafted.

The whole thing sounds like
an insane proto-type for Eliot
Gou1d‘s Move. Farina had to be
pretty intelligent to see, lets
say two years ahead of his time,
when things like he described
actually started happening on
Eastern college campuses. Or
perhaps, like Hemingway,
when he went to Europe he was
able to see things clearer and,
therefore project a little.

FARINA’S PEOPLE

Farina’s characters rest more
on their involvment in the plot
to overthrow the college heads
than anything else. They lack
individuality. They are all
strange and weird, but that does-
n’t necessarily imply human-
ness or wisdom. '

Book

Review

Farina seems to have a dis-
taste for college revolution. He
makes the entire thing look like
a huge comedy of errors. And
on top of it all stands his main
character Gnossos. I suppose
once again individual allot-
ness triumphs over the masses.
Charles Reich must have read
this book before he wrote “The
Greening of America.”

Of course that may have been
Farina’s intent. If his idea is
that there is something better
than mass action and demon-
strations, this modern wanderer
of his certainly sticks out from
the crowd. If that is what he
meant to say, then he has said
it well. If it isn’t, then the novel
is a reflection of he vacuos-
ness that unfortunately is char-
acteristic of much of today’s

“relevant” literature. Perhaps
that was his intent too.
“LONG TIME COMING. . .”

Long time coming and a long
time gone was just published
last year, and it is quite dif-
ferent from the novel. The book
was compiled after Farina’s

.death by his wife Mimi. It is

short fiction, song lyrics, diary
entries and essays. Each piece
is prefaced by Mimi Farina.
Joan Baez wrote the introduction.
Everything in this book was
written prior to the publication
of the novel.

For someone interested in
writing, the second Farina book

‘will be interesting, for it illus-

trates the development of his
style. For someone who is inter-
ested in Richard Farina, the book
is a good cross section of his
ideas and interests. For some-
one who is interested in plain,
old fashioned freak lore, there’s
that too. Something for every-
one, so to speak.

THE STYLE OF FARINA

. Seriously though, this collec-
tion (which ought to be titled
The Portable I Farina contains
prose that is more traditional in
style than the Been Down So
Long novel.

Although some of the stories
are clearly early efforts, many
of them, particularly the Irish
stories are just as well written
as the novel. Much of Farina’s
poetry in intensely emotional,
and occasionally obscure and
difficult to read. For all his
modernity, Farina still has some
of the traits of a traditionalist.
But then this is Farina’s early
writing-what he may have writ-
ten later is lost.

Farina’s most repeated themes
deal with “deathy” things. In
many of the prefaces Mimi Far-
ina echos and confirms this mor-
bidlfascination. His fascination
with demons is equally power-
ful. Joan Baez states in her
introduction that Farina lived
life with a terrific intensity. It
is strangely ironic that Richard
Farina’s career as a writer and
lyricist ended as it did.

A delightful evening of song,
dance and comedy is waiting
for anyone who can take the
time to venture east of Oakland
to see, “To Broadway With
Love“ at Ben Gross’ Restaurant
in Irwin.

Be forewarned, however, that
this fare is directed at the “ro-
mantic” musical comedy lover.

Don Brockett’s latest musical
revue has just opened for an
eight-week stay at the Canter-
bury Cabaret Room of Ben
Gross’ after returning from a
successful engagement at the
Bartke’s Dinner Theatre in Tam-
pa, Florida.

The musical-comedy revue of
two 45-minute acts is loaded
with popular Broadway songs
from the past and present and
an extremely versatile cast
puts on an energetic show for
the small audience which the
intimate cabaret room ac-
commodates.

Danny Graham, Barbara Klee,
Florence Lacey, and Bert Lloyd
recreate some of the most mem-
orable moments in Broadway
history. With Barbara Klee at
the piano, Graham sets the
tone of the evening with selec-
tions from Cabaret. He asks
the audience to “forget prob-
lems’’ for just an hour or so and
join in a whirlwind tour of
Broadway’s greatest hits.

A clever sketch quickly fol-
lows in which Lacey and Gra-
ham show three radically dif-
ferent waysof doing the classic
Cinderella—as Rodgers and
Hammerstein or Noel Coward
or Tennessee Williams might
have conceived it.

The light-hearted atmosphere

is changed briefly while Bar-'

bara Klee sings a moving “Fun-
ny Girl” medley with Streisand-
like quality. The fast pace is
restored, however, when Gra-
ham and Lacey return with
“Never Too Late” from “The
Boyfriend,” the musical which
introduced Julie Andrews to the
Broadway State at the age of
16. Lloyd and Klee join forces
to sing “MacArthur Park” by
Jimmy Webb. It highlights the
first act, for here Lloyd displays
his clear and powerful voice to
the audience without the aid
of an elaborate sound system.

After a brief interval, the cast
returns for a medley from “Cam-
elot” Lacey and Lloyd stopped
the show with the duet “If
Ever I would Leave You.“

Klee solos again, but this
it's “Another Hundred
People" from the current Broad-
way hit Company. She was
particularly successful in re-
creating this song since ‘her
voice and appearance are simi-
lar to Pamela Meyers who is
presently doing this number in
the Broadway show. -

“Other songs and sketches
follow and the show comes to a
close with a duet by Klee and
Lacey-“You Can Have Him”
from Liberty.

The finale of George M. Co'-
hen numbers brings down the
curtain on the show. The audi-
ence responded by demanding
an encore and the cast was

“If We Only Have
Jacques Brell’s hit.

The cast is homogeneously.
talented and each has his or
her particular forte. Klee and
Lloyd are excellent vocalists
and Graham handles the Come-
dic Material well. However,
the popular Florence Lacey .
steals the show; for she not 1:
only has a good voice, and a gift
for comedy but also has a
charming stage presence which
delights and engages the viewer.

Brockett is to be commend-
ed not for the material in the
show-most of it was written by
other artists-but for his success
in gathering together four young
people (not one is over 25) and
integrating their talents into a,
thoroughly enjoyable evening of
entertainment.

Love-

Unfortunately, the stage at
Ben Gross‘ is too small, which
poses great difficulties for
staging, but Brockett and cast
have managed to make the best
of a bad situation.

If you like Broadway musicals
and can’t afford to go to New
York to enjoy them, then you‘ll
be pleased by the offering at
the Canterbury Caberet Room,
on Rte 30, 15 miles east of Oak-
land. The show will be there
for eight weeks on Wednesdays,
Thursdays, and Fridays at 9:30

1701‘ RA Positions

by GUS AVRAKOTOS

The University Housing Office is again involved in the year-
ly process of screening and selecting applicants for Resident Assist-
ants (RA’s) for the year 1971-72.
is The RA serves as the closest link to the administration for all
resident students advising, informing, and counseling students.
In addition, the RA helps to orient students to the University com-
rn-unity and also serves in a semi-administrative role.

“Basically, the RA is a fellow student, and he is not viewed by

“the Housing Office as one who violates any confidences or’ acts

as a policeman,” said John Vrana, Housing Director. _ '
I-The selection of new RA’s is a lengthy, complete, and involved

~.process, beginning on Dec. 1 when applications become available

and lasting until about March 15, when final selection will take

'.I.place- '

“The Application,” said Judy DiMattia, Co-ordinator for Res-
‘idence Hall Personnel, “is the result of input obtained from meet-
ings with RA’s, rejected applicants, and information from 100 other

I‘ schools.”

DiMattia continued, “Groups of 3 to 4 people, consisting of
the Housing Staff, Black community, and the counseling center,

read the applications‘ and recommendations. After the applications A
have been evaluated, a number of 2-hour group interviews, with

10 to 15 applicants participating, are scheduled. Here a free-mov-

 ingidiscussion takes place,” she said.
he Vrana added, “The group interviews this year concentrated on

problems an RA might face—problems that have been experienced
in thepast.”

‘.“All Q interviewers then take independent evaluations of the

applicants,” stated DiMattia. “Next, interview evaluation'sheets,
iwith the total list of applicants, go out to all the RA’s, and the ,

housing staff asks for candid remarks about applicants they may
know,” I E

Shepointed out that all the information that is being compiled
is keptrin individual folders. Then the committees of interviewers
recommend to DiMattia between 80 to 100 applicants. “I will then

' speak with these people and make the final decision,” she said.

I “This year’s process was far more detailed, involved withother

‘ people, and practically oriented,” commented Vrana. “The proced-

‘ure this‘year is a refinement of the past, and next year’s will be a
“refinement of this year’s.”

‘ - ~“We are in a continual revision process,” added DiMattia, “con-

if stantly changing as we get more feedback and comments about our

methods of selection.”

_ V There are 91 RA’s involved in the entire Residence Hall Pro-
gram,’ with about 50 openings for the new applicants, since some

I‘ will» be rehired from the present RH’s. And for the other 50 open-

ings, the Housing Office is interviewing about 380 applicants.

".~"Vrana stated, “Obviously far more students want to be RA’s

than there are positions available? We are pleased that there is a
desire for people to become RA’s, and we try to makethe selection
process reflective of 1971. But about only one out of seven can be

I =chosen, making selecting more difficult.”

 

  ‘Creative Partnership’

Montgomery Outlines Role

by ELLIOT GILL

An A important innovation in
the structure of the administra-
tion was the creation of the Of-
fice of the Dean of Student.de—
velopment last summer.

“The Dean’s office was once
one of rules and orders,” Dean
Charles Montgomery recalled,
“but now our relationship with
the students is more one of crea-
tive partnership. I feel that
our greatest accomplishment has
been in the promotion of great-
er student involvement in the

decision-making process.”

According to Dr. Montgomery,
his own personal role is to co-
ordinate the activities of his dir-
ectors and to work in develop-
ing closer ties between the aca-
demic and the non-academic seg-
ments of the University. ’

Dr. Montgomery outlined
the structure of his office.

grams, and Information and Re-
search are autonomous, and each
has its own budget.” Dr. Mont-
gomery explained that the dir-
ectors were formerly assistant
deans of the now defunct Dean
of Students’ staff.

The office of Student Activi-

H ties deals with over 160 campus

groups. William Markus, its dir-
ector, echoed Dr. Montgomery
by commenting, “Today’s ad-
ministrator had better come out
from behind his desk. We can
no longer dictate what kinds of
programs are productive. In-
stead, we must work with the
students.”

“I see our role as helping

campus groups with the day-to-
day management of affairs. We
deal with questions of financ-
ing, roomspace, and communi-
cation between groups.” He
pointed out that the collection
of information, distribution of
posters, reservation of room
space for meetings, and general
problem-solving fall under his
jurisdiction.

Markus cited a number of spe-
cific accomplishments of his of-
fice. “A year ago we were just
providing reservations for the
Student Union. Now we’re do-
ing this for buildings across the
whole campus. We're also get-
ting into giving campus groups‘
advice on advertising and pub-
licity of their activities. We
may bring specialists in from in-
dustry to help show students how
to get the most from their pub-
licity dollar.”

He also noted that his office
is working with fraternities and
sororities to change the role of
the fraternity man and woman.
He predicted that Greek life
would change greatly in the next
few years. ’

He also commented, “We are
trying to persuade outstanding
faculty to participate in activi-
ties with students.”

Dr. Konnilyn Feig, the Dir-

rector of Special Programs, ex-

plained that her job is to assist

in the innovation of University

programs.

“First and foremost, we are a
resource center. We try to meet
the demands of various groups
by the implementation of new
programs.” We also want to
raise the awareness of students
by introducing them to all points
of view on various subjects.” I

Among the programs develop-
ed through Feig’s office have
‘been ones dealing with feminism,
racism, and the environment. She
explained, “We try not to dupli-
cate the work of students. We
hope in fact, that students will
follow our lead in developing
new programs.”

_ Dr. Feig said that her office is
involved in a number of programs
involving the surrounding com-
munity, as well as students, fac-
ulty, and administrators. She
felt that the major accomplish-
ment of her office was that of
the development of models from
which new programs could be
evolved.

Titan Freeze Fizzles
In Panther Victory

by MARTY HELLMAN

At least in the minds of the
Westminster Titans, the Pitt Pan-
ther basketball squad has achiev-
ed an aura of respectibility.

For the first time in recent
Panther history, a team used a
stall against them on Wednes-
day night at New Wilmington.
Pa. as the Titans attempted to
stay close by freezing the ball
most of the time. but Westmins-
ter lost 62-41 to the Panthers.
.who are now 11-7.

Taking only eight shots in the
first half and controlling the ball
most of the time. the Titans man-
aged to hold the Panthers to
their lowest point production for
a half this season as the score
stood at 19-12 at intermission.

The Titans continued the stall-
ing tactics in the second half and
narrowed the margin to 22-19
with 14 minutes left.

In the next four minutes, the
Panthers outscored the Titans 10-
3 and from that point on, the Ti-
tans were forced to stop stalling.

Once the ball got into play,
the Panthers gradually increased
their lead until the final buzzer.
Strong rebounding by Paul
0’Gorek, Bill Sulkowski and
Buzzy Harrison gave the Cats
control of the ball.

O’Gorek finished as high scor-
er in the contest with 17 points,
including 9 of 12 foul shots.
Kent Scott, who saw limited ac-
tion in the second half, had 11
points.

Both Gary Brown and Sam
Males netted 9 points for the
Titans.

O’Gorek also had an exception-
al defensive game as he blocked
four Titan shots.

Harrison had several important
steals in the second half and
wound up with 9 points.

Westminster was unable to re-
inforce its stall with the neces-
sary ballhandling and hot shoot-
ing necessary to make a stall suc-
cessful.

Unofficially, the Titans turned
the ball over 22 times to the
Panthers and shot a weak 31
percent from the field.

guarding Davidson's Eric Minlcln earlier

this season. Wednesday night, O’Gorek netted 17 points in the Pan-
thers 62-4l victory over Westminster. Pitt's 6-8 center also blocked

four Titan shots.

The Panthers, under pressure
to hit the shots when available,
had one of ‘their best shooting
nights in a while with 51 per-
cent accuracy from the field.
However, they sunk only 18-of
30 free throws, well under their
season's average.

In the waning moments of the
contest, Pitt Coach Buzz Ridl
cleared the bench after the Pan-
thers had racked up a 23 point‘
bulge. " ‘

The victory gave the Panthers
a 40-33 edge in the all—time com-
petition against the Titans.

There will be a return match
between the two schools Wednes-
day. February 24th. Starting
next season. the Panthers will
have 9 weekends of rest and

Plagued Pitt Matmen

Await Cornell Meet

By MARK SIGMON

With a wild melee erupting at the conclusion of the widely antici-
pated John Chatman-Wade Schalles wrestling match. the route was on
as the Pitt grapplers. outmanned and outfought. were annihilated by
Clarion Wednesday night, 30-5. with the possibility of the same disas-

trous outcome in a real one tomorrow when the Panthers host Cornell,

at Fitzgerald Field House at 2 p.m.

‘ Chatman suffered his first defeat of the year and his initial"

lost since he was decked by Schalles in the 1969 PIAA state finals. He
missed two opportunities for takedowns in the bout. and had had he

taken advantage of the latter op-
portunity in the last 30 seconds
Chatman would have won. 4-3. in-
stead of losing as he did, 5-2.

Just as the referee blew his
whistle signifying the end of the
158-pound match, Chatman and
Schalles began fighting. as elbows
went flying and fists flailed at
one another. Moments later. near-
ly two dozen spectators became
engaged in a tussle on the gym
floor. Ten minutes passed before
tempers cooled and order was re-
stored, so the wrestling match
could continue.

Sorely missing the latest addi-
tions to the grapplers’ incredi-
ble injury list, Dave Young
(knee problems), Bud Smeltz
(possible pinched nerve), and
Captain Bob Kuhn (shoulder sep-
aration), the crippled Pitt wrest-
lers won only two of ten bouts.
However, the victorious perform-
ances of Gary McClure at 126
and Craig Tritchlat 190 against
two of Clarion’s best grapplers
were encouraging.

McClure, who evened the
match score at 3-3 following Al
Cox’s 5-1 loss at 118. wrestled
aggressively the entire time he
was out on the mat. in carving
out a 13-7 victory. His foe.
Dale Murdock. who was defeated
by Randy Payne in last year‘s
dual meet, was fourth in the 1970
NAIA tournament.

Tritch. after trailing 2-0 early
in the first period. rallied in the
last two stanzas to capture a 9-3
decision. ‘Tritchs third period
ride. in which he gained two pre-
dicaments by using a single
grapevine. simply wore down
his Clarion opponent.

Making his varsity debut at
142 pounds, Pitt’s John Buzzato
put forth a game effort, before
dropping a 6-2 decision to Clar-
ion’s Garry Barton.

Rich Cross, Jim Fleming and
Lamar Hudson were pinned at
150, 167, and heavyweight, re-
spectively. by their Golden Ea-
gle foes. Hudson‘s bout was his

. first varsity showing.

At 134 pounds, Dave Wylie
dropped a 7-3 decision. 177 poun-

Assistant Coach Dick Slutzky is
trying to fill.

Boyce has a 6-3 record. The
only common opponent of Boyce
and the Pitt JV's. Stevens Trade
School, dropped a 28--13 decision
to Boyce and a 25-14 to Slutz-
ky‘s charges.

Boyce Coach Tony Dury said
that his squad has also been plag-
ued by injuries throughout the
season. However, his grapplers
are now at full strength for the
first time this year.

Dury believes that all of
Boyce‘s wrestlers will he look-
ing forward to competing “In

oer Fred Weber. the third Pitt
grappler making his initial start
of the season, lost 10-1.

Several times during the match
Pitt Head Coach Dave Adams

jumped off the bench to protest _

unfavorable calls by the referee.
During Wylie’s bout, the referee
stopped the action as Adams
once more questioned a disputed
call. This time, the ref deducted
one point from Pitt’s team score,
citing the Panther mentor for un-
sportsmanlike conduct. Thus,
McClure’s triumph was only
worth two points to the squad
tally,'instead of the usual three.

Although the varsity wrestling
match tomorrow was originally
scheduled to begin at 8 p.m..
following the Pitt JV-Boyce
match. the Pitt-Cornell encounter
will begin at 2 p.m. instead.

The Pitt-Cornell wrestling

’ “This is the meet we’ve been pointing. at for three weeks,”

Bill Righmire has been con-

while John Worthington has
been scoring high on the side-

of Pitt’s Dave Andrew, Mike
Beatty and Dick Pribis, all of
whom consistantly score in the
high eights. « . _

Despite the fact that his team
easily defeated the Pittshooters
only three weeks ago, Duquesne’s
coach Capt. Bechtold is very
concerned about .tonight‘s Pitt-
Dukes match at Trees Hall.

“We were upset last week by
C.M.U. because of our over-
confidence and I don’t intend
for that to happen again," he
said.

Another reason that the Du-
quesne marksmen will be “up”
for the match is the fact that
they are tied for second place in
the West-Penn standings with
Grove City. ’

Both teams have 7-3 records.
Indiana of course, is the leader
with a perfect record in league
matches, though two non-West-
ern Pa. Conference teams, West
Virginia and Penn State, have

Games in Louisville, Kentucky
this weekend.
For Richey, his invitation

marks the second major invita-
tional appearance in two weeks.
Two weeks ago he participated
in the Millrose Games in New
York.

Brown, who has already quali-
fied for the 600 in the Nationals,
is naturally pleased to be going
because the Games are one of
the major indoor events of the
season.

“The competition is going to
be good,” said Brown, “and
somehow I got invited. I’m sure
I’ll better my best time in the
600.” Brown's best time so far
in the 600 is 1:09.8.

Richey will again run in the
two mile race. Richey has also
qualified for the two mile in the
Nationals.

Their appearance in Louisville
will mainly be a prestigious one
since there are no team scores.

The rest of the track team will
see no action this week as result
of a cancelled dual meet against
Penn State. The team will pre-
pare for its February 20th appear-
ance in the Olympic Invitational.

Bechtold now has five shoot-
ers at Duquesne who average a
250 or better, with the return of
Rich Lamberski who missed
the entire first half of the sea-
son due to a touch football in-
jury. Lamberski averages a 255,
which would be tops on the Pitt
squad. It’s only fourth best on
the Duquesne team.

Top shooter for Bechtold is,
Dave Willard who shoots 270.
Only Indiana’s Bob Doverspike

Next comes captain Bob Dailey

tively. Rounding out this feared

the high. 240’s instead. Another
interesting bit of information is
the fact that the Pitt shooters’
highest match total, a 1,267
against Grove City, is only two
points above Duquesne’s low for
the year, a 1,265, also against
Grove City.

Duquesne’s average score is a
1,290 compared with Pitt’s
1,240.

As one Pitt shooter, who ob-
viously preferred to remain anony-
mous, stated, “We’l1 be lucky if
we can even keep it close. Last
time they beat us easily by a big
score, and they were overcon-
fident then.” Captain Bill Crooks,
though, expressed cautious 'opti-
mism: “We’re going to surprise
them, maybe even shock them.”

However, the Pitt team has
yet to get more‘ than two shoot-
ers to crack the 250 mark in one
match, despite the fact that
seven have surpassed 250 this
season.

“We’re hoping to start the season over again and start winning,“

said Pitt coach, Sandra Bullman.

Pitt’s last loss, its second, was to nationally ranked West Ches-
ter State College. Coach Bullman reflected on the loss. “According
to ability, colleges are ranked in high, middle. or low leagues," she

said. “Pitt is considered to be
very good among middle class
teams. But we can’t compare to
West Chester, one of the best in
the high leagues. The experi-
ence was good, however, for the
girls — they saw what could be
done with basketball."

Youngstown’s coach, Joyce
Ramsey, will probably go with
the line-up of Barb Barzak,
Kathy Lipkovich, Tina Sered-
nesky, Debbie Sprinkle and Sue
Ferrell. “So far, I've really been
impressed with the performances
of Barb and Kathy. Barb has
been outstanding in both her
offensive and defensive playing
and Kathy’s shooting has been
great,” related Coach Ramsey.

Pitt last met and defeated
Youngstown last year at a quad

Coach Bullman believes
Youngstown has improved 100

don’t have too much height but

they’re fast and a good bench——

they have alot of good substi-
tutes.”

“Over all. we have a good
chance of winning this game."
stated Coach Bullman. “We
have to work hard on getting the

to apply it in the game. If we ,

Hockey Players Of A ll   Sorts

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

Players on one team wearing all sorts of uniforms. including
make-shift ones, assemble twice a week at the Alpine Ice Chalet
in Braddock Hills for an hour of ice hockey practice. Their experi-
ence, like their garb, comes in all varieties.

The hockey enthusiasts call themselves the Pitt Ice Hockey Club.

I though they are still about a week away from officially being recog-

nized as a University of Pittsburgh student organization.

Joe Testa, a Pitt freshman.
organized the group at the be-
ginning of the present term and

. was surprised when “over forty"
guys turned out for an organi-

zational meeting. He estimates
that each practice now attracts
ranging from

Some of the participants have

‘ been playing hockey for quite

awhile, but most are like Joe,
who has only been after the
Others,
in fact, were never on the ice
as hockey players before this
term.

One of the latter category is
the Club‘s goalie. Mark Lieber-
man. He’s from St. Louis, where
the game is very big because

,6 ‘of the gains of the National
‘Hockey Leagues Western Divi-

sion champion Blues. but
Mark's only hockey experience
had been off the ice.

“The only reason I'm the top

" goalie-the only one~is because

the pads fit me,“'he says. “I‘m

the only one short enough to

fit into them.“

Leiberman’s five-foot height
becomes such an advantage for
him because of the lack of ti-
nances of the club that’s not
yet a club. The knee pads he
uses are borrowed from the Pitts-

burgh Amateur Hockey League,
which consists of players
through to the middle teen-age
bracket.

Only when the Pitt group is
recognized by the Student Asso-
ciation can it apply for financial
aid from the SA"s allocation com-
mittee.

Though there are a few other
goalie aspirants. the hockey club
isn‘t panicing over the automatic
position Leiberman has gained.
despite his lack of experience.
The group’s coach, Wade Welch,
a secretary for the Alpine Divi-
sion of the Pittsburgh Amateur
League, is impressed with the
strides Leiberman has made un-
der supervision of the Alpine
rink‘s manager, Bill Izza.

Many of the members are just
as new to the game as Leiber-
man, but the only one with
experience as a Pitt athlete has
plenty of hockey background.

He‘s Glenn Hyde, a freshman
football player last fall from
Lexington, Massachusetts. Hyde
has been involved with football
and hockey since the fourth
grade and finds his play with the
hockey club a little different
from the more organized Pitt
football program.

 he says.

The Hockey Club's goalie, Mark Lieberman, shot this photo of some
of the players at practice.

“It‘s about the same, I guess."
“But here (with the
hockey club) it’s more of just
for the fun of it right now."

Testa, who is the president of
the club,'doesn’t want the group
to be “just for the fun of it”
always. His plans are big.

“I want to get club status soon
because we can apply for var-
sity status then,” he says. “That‘s
going to take a long time to get.
if we can get it. And I think we
can because if 200-500 people
show up for our games that’s
more than half the varsity teams

probably get."
Only four varsity teams can

. now attract as big a crowd as

Testa envisions, and none of
them have a home as far away
from campus as the Alpine Ice
Chalet. But Testa is banking on
the increasing popularity of
the sport, as the hockey club
plans games within the next
couple of months against
clubs from schools like St. Fran-
cis and Carnegie-Mellon.

Before that, however, the guys
have to get some money so
their uniforms will match.
