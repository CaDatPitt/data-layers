As over 100 students chanted, sang and
screamed on the Cathedral Lawn protesting
Pitt’s alleged interest in Mt. Graham, down-
town, City Council joined in the movement
by passing a resolution stating its objections
to the project.

Yesterday Arizona’s “red squirrel” made
an appearance in front of the Cathedral
of Learning, announcing that Pittsburgh
City Council’s resolution will be “saving
me.” '

“Not only did City Council state an objec-
tion to the project as a whole, it stated an
objection to the project here at the
University of Pittsburgh,” said Mt. Graham
Coalition activist Josh Knauer.

“When in the hell will Chancellor U.
Dennis] O’Connor listen to his professors,
his students, the people who run the city,”
he said.

“Chancellor O’Connor is all alone; no one
supports him. When will he come out here
and face up to the facts?”

Mt. Graham, Ariz., is the site of a
proposed telescope site for which
the University of Arizona is seeking commit-
ments from institutions across the country.

Environmentalists are concerned because
the site is home to several endangered
species and is considered sacred by some
Native American groups, mainly the
Apaches.

Despite the many allegations that Pitt is
interested in the project, university officials
say that is not the case.

“The Mt. Graham project is not under
active consideration by the University
of Pittsburgh at this present time,” said
Leon Haley, executive director of Public
Affairs.

Monday night, about 70 people camped
out to prepare for the day of action.
The activists from Pitt and several other
universities, greeted with blue skies and
wamr temperatures Tuesday morning, pre-
pared to speak out against the telescope
project.

Activists started up the chant, “1, 2, 3, 4 —

we don’t want your scopes no more —— 5, 6,
7, 8 —— help Mt. Graham revegetate,” as well

“Some things take priority,” said Ohio

“I think the big issues for me are the
endangered species [and] the abuse that the
European cultures have done to the Native
American culture,” T ockman said. “Most
people think the abuse of Native Americans

IFC plans
charity
events

Byjohn B. Moore
Staff Writer

In an effort to help out the
United Cerebral Palsy charity, at
least 36 Greeks will devote three
nights to answering phones.

The UCP tele-fundraiser, to
take place on April 11, 12 and 13,
was one of two charity events
discussed at last night’s Inter-
Fratemity Council meeting.

George Genchur,
Community Service chair, said at
least 12 men a night were expect-
ed for the event.

“We wanted to help a good
organization and to help improve
our image at the same time,”
Genchur said.

The fraternities and sororities
have been involved with the UCP
in the past, said Genchur, and the
Panhellenic Association notified
the IFC about this particular
event.

The IFC also announced that
Family House would be the char-
ity for next year’s Greek Week.

IFC President Brian Rifkin said
there would be some changes
with Greek Week next year.
“Greek Week is sort of like a big
pig and we’re going to be cutting
out all of the fat.”

Another subject brought up at
the meeting was the need for
Risk Management chairs.

“Risk Management was formed
to make parties safer for the
guests,” said Matt Friedman.

Representatives from each
house make sure that parties
don’t get out of hand, and are
responsible for making sure
guests arrive home safe.

According to Rifkin, Risk
Management was responsible for
getting kegs out of the fraternity
parties nationwide about four
years ago. “The parties used to
be real crazy and out of hand,”

U.S. senatorial candidate Watkins presents platform to OMFC

Byjon Hayes
Staff Writer

Republican US. Senatorial
candidate Joseph Watkins
brought his message of hard
work, welfare reform and the
importance of entrepreneurship
to members of the Organization
of Minority and Female
Conservatives last night.

Before discussing his platform
and taking questions from the
audience, Watkins outlined his
biography. He is an ordained
minister, the president of Kinslor
Inc, a public relations company
he founded and a former White

House aide under George Bush.
He wants to help people
change their lives, he said. “What
can I do as an African-American,
as someone living in America
who happens to be black  to
encourage people to reform the
welfare system, to help people
who have low self-esteem to
regain that self-esteem,” he said.
He said he supports early
intervention policies to prevent
people from becoming criminals.
He said he would enact more
stringent laws to protect victim’s
rights and punish criminals. He
opposes President Clinton’s
“three—strikes” policy for crimi-

nals and will work toward a
“one-strike” system for violent
offenders, he said.

“If somebody committed a vio-
lent crime against somebody you
love, you wouldn’t want the
judge to say, ‘Well, this is a first-
time offense. You’ve got two
more chances to go out there
and hurt somebody else’  we
can’t give them that chance,” he
said.

Watkins said the welfare sys-
tem contributes to crime because
the system forces fathers to move
out of the home by granting
some additional financial bene-
fits to single mothers. He said

this policy is anti—family values
and should be changed.

“You would see a tremendous
drop in crime, in inner cities and
in poor areas, if there was a
father in the household, because
fathers aren’t going to let their
sons go out there and do silly
things,” he said.

Watkins said another priority is
helping small businesses.
Specifically, he said his health-
care proposals would oppose
Clinton’s program. According to
Watkins, Clinton’s plan would
derive 80 percent of health-care
revenue from small business
owners. He said Clinton’s plan

offers “a disincentive for
growth.”
He said he has earned

$500,000 in three years as head
of his company, which works
with celebrities, including sever-
al NBA players.

“The great thing about
American society is that any-
body, without regard to who
they are and where they come
from, if they have the dream and
are willing to work hard to see
that dream through can make
something out of nothing,” he
said.

Watkins said he faces obsta-

By Bruce DeBroff
Staff Writer

Student artists can con-
tribute works to the fourth
annual student art and film
festival, sponsored by the
Student Media Art Club.

David Lawrence Hall will
be the backdrop for the festi-
val this Thursday at 7:50
p.m.

“Since it’s not a contest,
we don’t have a committee
which chooses what we will
or won’t show, because we
don’t censor. All art submit-
ted will be accepted for the
show,” said sophomore
Polly Lewis, who is the cur-
rent president of SMAC.

Students contribute

“We’re not trying to raise
money or make a statement,
we are just trying to provide
a stage where Pitt students
will be able to showcase‘
their talents,” Lewis said.

The art and film exhibit is
just one half of this year’s
spring festival. A free music
festival will be held on the
lawn in front of the William
Pitt Union on Saturday
beginning at 1 p.m.

Local groups such as Anti-
Flag, Blind Sight and the
African Drum Ensemble are
just a few of the acts who
will be on hand for this
spring ritual.

SMAC meetings are Tues-
days at 5 p.m. in WPU 411.

He said he has heard about
the Mt. Graham project for the
past three years, and when he
found out Pitt was involved, he
decided he had to come to the
protest since it was close to
home.

OU graduate student Brad
Sutlick said he came to
Pittsburgh “to fight the corrupt
administration who doesn’t care
about their students, nature or
the environment.”

Keny Vachta, a Michigan State
graduate student, said her group
of four came to “show support
for the group who is still fight-
ing.”

Michigan State recently recon-
sidered any involvement in the
Mt. Graham project. Vachta said
there was a celebration on
Michigan State’s campus yester-
day afternoon celebrating the
school’s decision not to get
involved.

The Ohio State University had

intense pressure, and that is why

Hazelbaker, an eastern field
organizer for the Mt. Graham

Coalition, said Pitt essentially ‘

took OSU’s place in involvement
and that added responsibility to
his group since it helped per-
suade OSU to withdraw.

“We got ours to pull out,” he
said. “We had a duty to stick
with it and protect the mountain
as best as we could. I love the
mountain. I want to see our
environment laws enforced, not
exempted.”

Susan Krajnc, who works on
the University of Toronto cam-
pus, said the reason she decided
to take the road trip was for “sol—
idarity.”

The University of Toronto
withdrew its considerations in
early January, and a number of
student groups protested there
earlier in the year about possible
involvement.

Krajnc said since Toronto

pulled out, Pitt is the only school
left, and they have to fight
against possible commitment.

Annette Ham, a senior at
Slippery Rock University, said, “I
see the actions of Mt. Graham
really going against what our
nation is really about.”

She said everyone should be
working for Mother Earth, not
against her.

Two North Hills High School
sophomores said they came out
primarily to hear Rusted Root,
but also thought the cause was
important. Fawn Mullinaiy said
she used the excuse of an ortho-
dontist’s appointment, while her
friend Kerrie Vinski said she had
a doctors appointment.

Pitt activist Matt Peters said,
“Fin overwhelmed with the sup-
port we got from other schools.
I’m proud to stand with them
today for the sake of the moun-
tain.”

“A big hurdle for a lot of
African Americans is the word
conservative because the
only paradigms they have are
conservatives they don’t like,
like Jesse Helms,” he said.

Watkins said until the prop-
er role models are elected to
office, African Americans will
not be able to identify with
the conservative platfonn. He
said African Americans, as a

block, have not voted
Republican since 1960.

“That has got to change for
a couple of reasons. From the
pragmatic side, it makes
sense because as long as any
special interest group gives
all their votes to one party
they have no leverage.
Democrats will take our [the
African-American] vote for
granted and Republicans will
write us off because they fig-

he said, “but those who were in
the fraternities at that time are

now in the position to the make '

Management being implemented
through each chapter nationally
it is easier for the IFC at Pitt to
regulate parties.

Rifkin also said that having
Risk Management at the national
level helps reduce the reliability
factor of the individual fraterni-
ties. “That’s the reason that 22
fraternities all have their own
risk management, [because] it
takes away some of the responsi-

Protest

Continued from page I

Pitt Black Studies Professor
Dennis Brutus joined the activists
in the ﬁght against the project.

About 100 activists gathered
yesterday afternoon in front of the
Cathedral of Learning before
Brutus spoke, while many
students stopped as they
were heading toward or leaving
class.

“We are here for a number of
solemn reasons — the more
solemn of issues is how we treat
our mother [Earth], how we care
for our mother [Earthl,” Brutus
said.

Brutus said that is a very serious
issue for every person who was
sitting on the lawn and every
other person in the Cathedral of
Learning.

He asked the crowd to say “Pitt

I off Mt. Graham” three times loud-

ly. A few minutes later, he
requested the crowd to repeat
“Education not extinction” three
times so loudly that O’Connor

would be able to hear it in his
office. The crowd obliged with
large roars.

Brutus said there are three main
concerns for now.

The first is to protect this planet
and the fragile resources
destroyed by greed, he said.

According to Brutus, the sec-
ond is to be multicultural, diverse
and respect others.

“We ought to respect religious
beliefs of others,” Brutus said.

The third is the economy. “We
know this country is in bad shape.
The number of homeless people
in this country is going up, the
number of hungry children
is going up, the number of unem-
ployed is going up,” he
said. “Money has to be spent
wisely.”

After Brutus spoke, a mock
wedding between O’Connor and
University of Arizona’s President
Manuel Pacheco, with Pope John
Paul II officiating, was held. The
activists dressed as the two
administrators walked down the
railing of the outside Cathedral
steps while being booed. Once
they arrived be.fore the unofficial
pope, the activist said, “The
greedy couple wishes to tie the
knot.”

During the mock ceremony,
each of the fake administrators
made promises. “I promise to

ignore my students’ concerns to
have this heavenly scope,” said
the man who dyed his hair grey to
play O’Connor’s part. Brutus and
some students began to yell
“objection.”

Brutus said his objection was
based on grounds of infinity.
“This action is going to desecrate
land, squirrels  ’

He said it needs to be clear
whether the university has or has
not been invited to participate in
the Mt. Graham project and if it is
not going to accept the invitation
to commit.

“We should know these facts.
Students should be made aware
of 

Other students came up to the
microphone and relayed their
objections. Then, the red squinel
jumped onto the stage and
grabbed the man playing
O’Connor off of the stage, while
the students jumped on the man
playing Pacheco.

After the mock ceremony, the
band Rusted Root performed for
the crowd.

“We’re out here because we care
about what's going on around
us,” said activist Stacey Dolnick, a
f1rst—year Pitt student.

“We’re not going to stand by
and let lPitt’s involvement in
Mount Grahaml happen. It’s
wrong.”

Three ways to beat
the high cost of college.

1. The Montgomery GI Bill
2. Student loan repayment
3. Part-time income

The Army Reserve Alternate Training Program is a smart way to pay for
college.

First, ifyou qualify, the Montgomery GI Bill can provide you with up to
$6,840 for current college expenses or approved vo/tech training.

Second, if you have—orobtain—a qualiﬁed student loan not in default,
you may get" it paid off at the rate of 15% per year or $500, whichever is greater,
up to a maximum ofSl0,00(). Selected military skills can double that maximum.

Third, you can earn part-time money in college, and here's how it works? *

One summer you take Basic Training, and the next summer you receive skill
training at an Army school. You'll eam overSl ,500 for Basic and even more for
skill training. 'llien you'll attendmonthly meetings at an Anny Reserve unit
near your college, usually one weekend a month plus two weeks a year. You'll
be paid over  105 a weekend to start. It's worth thinking about. Give us a call:

Students prove their dedication

Over 100 students from universities in surrounding
states gathered on the Cathedral of Learning lawn yes-
terday afternoon. Students mixed and intermingled all
in the spirit of collegiate protest to “Keep Pitt Off Mt.
Graham.”

This forced those who may skim over a news article
or walk by an information table to take notice of the
Mt. Graham issue. The group was right in front of the
Cathedral, and students going to and coming from
class could not help but see it, its banners and its mes-
sage. Even for those who may not like the environ-
mentalist movement, it is undeniable that Mt. Graham
Coalition activists put a lot of time, energy, thought
and creativity into communicating their concerns to the
community. Thus they deserve credit for actively
involving themselves on the campus, standing up for
what they believe in and organizing such a large-scale
event.

Keeping it out in the open is the only way to keep
the university community aware. Although university
officials say they are not currently looking into the
telescope project, that in no way guarantees that Pitt
will never be interested in investing in the project. If
the protesting stopped and Pitt should decide to invest
or take another look at the project, it would be too late
for students to do anything that would have any conse-
quence. Not only did students organize the large-scale
protest, but students also brought the issue to the

attention of Pittsburgh City Council, making their case

to the council yesterday as well.

City Council took a stance opposing the project, giv-
ing more credence to the voices of Mt. Graham
Coalition activists, as well as putting a little more pres-
sure on the university to stay off the Arizona mountain
now, as well as in the future. It was also reassuring to
see a Pitt professor joining in the protest yesterday.
Although there are experts on everything at this uni-
versity, very rarely are they called in or included in stu—
dent-organized protests. This helps to make the issue

more of a university-wide concern rather than a ‘mere

student concern.

We commend Pitt Professor Dennis Brutus for taking
the issue seriously and lending his time to what had
previously been, for the most part, a student move-
ment. It is good to see this type of an example at the
university, a faculty member vocalizing his beliefs. \

The Mt. Graham activists have shown their dedica-
tion to their beleifs, following the project's develop-
ments for over one year. No matter how one feels
about the Arizona mountain or the red squirrel, it's
still reassuring to see college students protesting for
what they beleive to be right and sticking with the
issue.

Why do people hate the media?

Why is it that so many peo-
ple seem to hate the media?

Politicians, ministers and all
types of leaders of movements,
whether they be mainstream or
“fringe” groups appear to want
to take the press to task for
misrepresenting their causes or
intentions — it’s almost as if
they thrive on press bashing to
promote themselves. As a
result, often media figures are
considered about as untrust-
worthy as used-car salesmen or
the politicians they often cover.

I think there are two reasons
for this.

First, the very nature of the
media deals not so much with
reality than with perception.
We journalists (although I’m
strictly a columnist for The Pitt
News, I have done reporting in
the past) are, of course, taught
to be “objective” and report
news, not to interpret it.
Ideally, we ought not to allow
our own biases to slant our
stories in one way or another
to promote a particular view-
point.

In practice, however, this is
virtually impossible. Reporters
are human beings too, with
their own set of values, their
own culture and their own
experiences.

A white Anglo-Saxon
Protestant male will tend to see
things a little bit differently
than a woman, an African-
American, a Roman Catholic or
someone of Asian extraction
and will probably write appro-
priately.

My father said to me many
years ago that, in order to get
at the truth of a story, one
should read six or seven news-
papers.

Only fairly recently did_I
understand what he was talk-

ing about.
Another important issue is
“What is news?” — or, better

yet, “What does our audience
think is news?”
Media cannot be taken seri-

» . - V 9. I

ously unless they know the
type of people who are reacl—
ing, listening or watching them,
and that’s probably one reason
there’s an opinion page.

What might be interesting on
the Pitt campus might go over
like a lead balloon at Carnegie
Mellon, Grove City or UCLA;
conversely, no one here
may care what goes on in
places like Ethiopia, Albania or
Belize.

Then, there is the issue of
time. Reporters have to get
their facts, check them, write
them fast and have them edited

for that day’s or the next day’s ,

Rick ,
Nowlin

edition or newscast. They can
only go on the information
they have at the time and are
subject to people who might

. not tell the truth.

And they have been lied to
quite often — or, to understate
it a little, just not told the entire
truth. I did a speech for my
mass media‘ course on the
Iran-Contra arms scandal which
I entitled “Media Held
Hostage.”

The other reason I think so
many people are hostile to the
press is that there are a lot of
people out there with a strong
commitment to a particular
agenda.

Now, there’s nothing in and
of itself wrong with having an
agenda, but it becomes a little
bit tiresome when less-than-
favorable coverage becomes
interpreted as a personal
attack.

Depending on whom you
talk to, the press is simultane-
ously racist, sexist, homopho-
bic, anti-religion, Marxist, elitist
and anti-Semitic.

Some organizations try to use
the press either as a public
relations tool or to gain sym-
pathy for their particular caus-
es.

Eleven years ago, I received
a fund-raising mailing from
Jimmy Swaggart Ministries;
enclosed was a copy of an arti-

cle on Swaggart reprinted froiu

Newsweele magazine which he
referred to as “blasphemy of
the worst kind” —- but upon
reading it without all his critical
comments, I realized that, if I
were a reporter covering one
of his crusades, I might say
some of the same things.

Then there are those groups

who promote themselves
as one thing and yet their
rhetoric simply doesn’t match
their self—image. Few people.
would take the Nation of
Islam’s Louis Farrakhan seri-
ously if he denied that he
was a racist.
Members of Operation Rescue
say that their organization is
simply a nonviolent anti-abor-
tion protest; however, that
would be hard to believe, con-
sidering the contempt they
have for authority.

One city cop I know said
that a “rescuer” spit on him;
OR’s leader, Randall Terry has
publicly called for the death
or Christian conversion of
pro-choice Supreme COLIIT jus-
tices.

Admittedly, the press may
very well be unfair, given the
constraints we have to work
with. ‘

However, given the choice
between a mistake—prone free
press and mere propaganda
masquerading as news, I’ll
gladly take the former.

Whether we like it or not,
even a seemingly hostile press
is one of the foundations
of American democracy, and
we should learn to live with
it.

The Panthers, after

leads in game one,
escaped with a victo-
ry .after third baseman Josh Tyler’s squeeze
bunt'in the bottom of the seventh scored
second baseman Scott Etsell from third,
stealing a 7-6 win from the Dukes.

The nightcap was a smorgasbord of-

squandered opportunities, as the Panthers
stranded eight baserunners in scoring posi-
tion and 10 overall in an 8-3 loss.

“This was just a really poor effort on our
part,” Panther head coach Mark Jackson

“Granted, it’s tough to stay up every pitch

If there was just one aspect of the game
in which the Panthers were ineffective, their
poor performance could illuminate a specif-
ic part of their game that needs work.

Unfortunately, Jackson and the Panther
coaching staff were not counting on a com-
plete single-game collapse.

‘ allowed game two to get ugly

The number one pitching
problem for the blue-and—gold
seems to be concentration.
When playing against non-Big
East opponents, the pitching
has been subpar at best. This is
evidenced in the tie versus
Geneva on March 24 and the
loss and close win against the
Dukes (7-6, 8-3) yesterday.

don’t get it done,” Tedde

in game two the trio of Jamie

and five of those baserunners
scored. Duquesne pitching
allowed eight walks, but only

The problems
begin on the mound,
where a very tired-
looking pitching staff
had a terrible day
against a very aver-
age Dukes team hit-
ting .264 on the year.
After coming into
yesterday’s double-
header with a team
ERA of 4.56 and giv-
ing up an average of
four walks per game,
the Panther hurlers
allowed 15 free pass-
es, including a sea-
son-high 10 in game
two, and added 17
points to their ERA
by giving up 14 runs,
10 earned, to the
Dukes.

Their lack of con-
trol was most evident
in game two, when
the Dukes scored
twice in the opening
frame without laying
a bat on the ball,
thanks to five free
rides.

“It seems that during the week, we just
don’t get it done,” RHP Tedde Campbell
said.

“We go into a Big Ea_st series, and every-
body’s pumped up for it, but it seems that
when we play the lower teams, we sink
down with them. We’re not concentrating.”

The Panther’s woes did not end on the
mound. In the field, the normally razor-
sharp performance of the Pitt squad was

two of those scored.

The loss to the Dukes cannot
be blamed only on the pitching.
Untimely errors and a lack of
consistent hitting were detri-
mental to the Pitt cause. Two
runs in each game of the dou-
bleheader were unearned.
Campbell got the victory in
game one and pitched 4 2-3
innings of one hit ball in the
nightcap.

In game one, Campbell
entered the game in the top of
the seventh and retired the two
batters that he faced. This
earned him the win to improve
his record to 3-1 on the season.
In game two Campbell allowed
two runs, neither of them
earned, while striking out eight
and walking three. One run was
his own fault because of a
throwing error to third, and the
other run scored on a throwing
error by catcher Bill Derr.

“There is a lot of irrational
behavior going on in the
dugout,” Campbell said.

“The guys who don’t usually
dress are at the end of the
bench, doing whatever, and that
drags the whole team down.
Our motto is ‘We are family,’
and the equations just were not
there today.”

Panthers grow and develop as spring football progresses

By Stephen Flinn
Staﬂ‘ Writer

Spring football gets its name
because it describes football
practice sessions held in the
spring season —— well, almost.
Another definition of spring,
from Webster’s Dictionary, is to
grow or develop, to come
together rapidly, to move
upward and forward and to
make a series of leaps and
bounds.

Although not the original
meaning of the word “spring,”
the latter is a much better defini-
tion for the meaning of the
word “spring,” as in spring foot-
ball, for the Panthers this year.

Players and coaches are in
agreement that this year’s spring
football drills are going well,
with excellent progress being
made in many areas.

“The attitude this spring has
been very good,” Pitt coach
Johnny Majors said. “We have
made considerable progress
over last year, and I have defi-
nitely seen improvement in our
program.”

As the players become more
comfortable with Majors’ system
and style of play, they can con-
centrate on improving and com-

than having to learn a new sys—
tem from scratch.

“We are really gelling and
becoming a tighter-knit group.
We are becoming more accus-
tomed to Coach Majors’ desire
for intensity,” junior offensive
lineman Rick Cardinali said.
“There is no time for standing
around. The coaches are coach-
ing, and the players are playing
— pretty much on the run.

“Also, the coaches are looking
to the seniors to provide leader-
ship, and the players are
responding.”

Senior defensive lineman
Tom Bamdt said he is working
hard, knowing his example will
provide some of that leadership
the coaches are looking for.

“I don’t have any speeches for
the younger guys. I am just try-
ing to play harder, get better,
and I know that will serve as a
good example of leadership,”
Bamdt said.

Redshirt-junior linebacker
Tom Tumulty is also being
asked to provide some leader-

ship.

“It’s fun. Spring ball is going
real well. Were all excited.”
T umulty said.

Junior linebacker Jason
Chavis said he is working hard
in an effort to become a better
player as part of an improved
team.

“Were all moving towards
improvement and getting better.
Practice is going real good for
me, and I think for everybody,
coaches and players alike,”
Chavis said. '

Sophomore linebacker Miles
Davis also said that he feels
spring drills are going well.

“We know more exactly what
we’re doing now. It’s work, but
it’s fun also, and I think it’s
going well,” Davis said.

It may be fun, but spring
practice is also hard work for
both the coaches and players.
Defensive line coach Tom
Turchetta said that the hard
work will pay off.

"Our pitchers know what
their best pitches are, and
they must be able to throw
those pitches, and we didn't
do a good job doing that
today.”

The visitors from down
Forbes Avenue received two
very good pitching perfor-
mances. In game one, Chad
Koshar threw 5 2-5 innings
giving up eight hits, six runs
(two earned), two walks and
one strikeout.

Dan Lisac took the mound
in game two for the Dukes.
His line was six innings
pitched, three runs (all of
them earned), eight hits,

seven walks and six strike-
outs for his first victory of the
season.

Duquesnels answer to the
Wild Thing was Damien
Dubien.

He took the loss in game
one by pitching two-thirds of
an inning allowing three hits,
one run (the game winner),
walking one and striking out
one. In the second game
Dubien threw one inning
giving up no runs or hits,
walking one and striking out
two of the three batters that
he faced.

The pitching staff for the
Panthers has led them to a 6-
0 record in the Big East and a
10-6-1 record in out—of-con-
ference contests.

ing in five errors for the two
games. The Panther miscues
kept the Dukes alive in several
innings, and resulted in four
unearned mns.

On the basepaths, the light-
ning—quick Panthers shot them-
selves in the foot on several
occasions. Though they suc-
cessfully stole eight bases,
upping their season total to 119,
they also were caught stealing
once and picked off twice, suc-
cessfully killing two potential
Panther rallies.

The Panther offense was the
lone driving force to Pitt’s victo-
ry in game one, and even they
couldn’t stop the trend of lethar-
gic play, and succumbed to a
strong performance on the
mound by Dukes starter Dan
Lisac in game two.

Nonnally, the matchup of an
offense which is hitting .529
overall and averaging nearly 9.5
runs per game against a pitch-

drama. But, on this day full of

Despite the disappointing
split, Panthers Tyler and
Craig Crawley had excellent
games. Tyler had four hits,
including three in game one,
while driving in a run and
scoring two. His 4-for-8 day
at the plate increased his
team-high batting average to

Crawley went 4-for-5 at the

games yesterday, while dri-

24 runs scored in just 43 at-

Panther pitcher Campbell,
the one bright spot in the
Panther pitching staff against
the Dukes, got the win in
game one, pitching two-
thirds of an inning without
surrendering a hit. He added
four and two—thirds of one-
hit ball to the game two
defeat, giving up two runs,
neither of them earned.

April 6, 1994

For most of us in Western Pennsylvania three meals a day are assured. For approximately 200,000 of our neighbors,
however, it is a luxury that doesn’t always happen. To help address this problem the University will again participate in the
Scouting for Food campaign, a food collection drive sponsored by the Allegheny Trails Council of the Boy Scouts of America.

You can help with this vital project by bringing nonperishable food and grocery items to the University from April 12 to
14, and putting them in the hampers and boxes placed at strategic locations in most University buildings. While any canned
food in good condition is welcome, there are several types of foods which are preferred because of their nutritional value:
peanut butter (in plastic containers), chunky—type soups, tuna, stews, meats, baby formula or any complete packaged meal.

Once collected the food items will be provided to the area's 450 food pantries and kitchens for distribution to needy
individuals. A growing concern is the large number of single mothers and frail elderly who are turning to the food kitchens
and pantries for assistance. Today, nearly 60% of the food collected goes to help women and children.

Remember to review your surplus food in the pantiy at home, and feel free to stock up on specials at your grocery store.
All of your contributions will address critical community needs. Bring what you “can” between April 12- 14.

Sincerely,

William W. Harmon
Vice Chancellor
