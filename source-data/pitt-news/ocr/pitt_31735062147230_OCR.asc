$100,000 Fire
Reduces Lab
To T_o‘Evl Ruin

While more than a dozen ﬁre
. trucks slipped and slid over the
hilly campus streets in an at-
tempt to reach the blaze, ﬁre
swept the two-story frame Uni-
versity Mines and Mineralogy
building, situated just beyond
Trees Gymnasium ﬁeld, leaving
it in total ruins by 9:30 o’clock
last night.

J. E. McLean, assistant busi-
ness manager of the University,
estimated the loss at $100,000.

Miss Rearick, of the physical
education department, and a
group of women students attend-
ing a. meeting of VVAA in Trees

G_vnn1asium noticed ﬂames at the '

windows on the second ﬂoor of
the building. The ﬁre was report-
ed through a city ﬁre box at 7 :45
o’clock. _

There were no persons in the
building at the time, the last class
having been dismissed‘ at 5:30
o’clock. It was approximately
eight minutes before eight when
the ﬁrst ﬁre truck arrived on the
scene.

By that time the blaze had too
much headway to allow the sav-
ing of any part of the building,
used for laboratory purposes by
tl1e department of chemistry.
Chemicals stored in the building
gave an added impetus to the
ﬂames of the burning structure,
attracting a crowd of several hun-
dreds to the scene, making it nec-
essary for ﬁremen to erect rope
lines in front of Trees Gymnasium.

The explosions of combustible
chemicals and the varied colors of
others as the ﬁre touched them
«made ]tl1e'sp‘ect‘a‘cle al1ii'o“s't”‘as‘ bril:
liant as it was destructive.

Nothing was saved.

The materials, ventilating system,
plumbing equipment, and chemical
supplies comprise more than half of
the total loss. The estimated replace-
ment value for the building is $30,000.
In addition, approximately $5,000 worth
of student equipment was destroyed.

Several hundred drawers containing
geology specimens valued at $2,000

partment of geology, were among the
articles destroyed. A large amount of
ge'ological'mate1-ial had been removed.
to the Ca‘th_edral two years ago, when

edthere. ' '

. The building was of yellow pine
construction and was erected in 1917.
It was 180 feet long, by 42 feet wide.
Evening classes are held in the build-
ing on Mondays and Wednesdays, but
it was vacant last night.

Plans for relocating classes sched-
uled in the building were being for-
mulated late last night by Dr. Alex-
ander Silverman, head of the depart-
ment of chemistry.

The last major ﬁre a.t the University
occurred in 1932 when a pipe shaft
on the ﬁrst floor of the Cathedral
ignited, destroying equipment on the

ﬁrst three ﬂoors.

Townsend ’s Representative

Defends Revolving Pensions

“There is no such thing as recovery
without reform, The present ﬁnancial
structure of o11r country has been a
failure. We must ﬁnd some way of
correcting a faulty system.” With
these words, Mr. VV. F. Brown, official
representative for the Townsend Plan
in Pittsburgh, characterized present
conditions which make something like
the Townsend Plan a necessary re-
form in the United States.

“We not only need a plan for recove-
ry from our present condition,” he
continued, “but we also need some-
thing more permanent, something that
will last for future generations.”

Mr. Brown maintained that “Old Age
Retirement Fund” is really a mis-
nomer, as the Townsend Plan is more
of a recovery plan rather than a re-
tirement system. c

Soundly thrashing the present eco-
nomic system, Mr. Brown pointed out
that opportunity for young people se-
curing positions is less today than at
any other time in our country. In view
of these conditions, Townsendites feel
that retiring 10,240,000 men and wo-
men over the age of 60 will open up
that many positions to young people.
Of these 10 million, approximately two
million persons will retain their posi-
tions, since they would be ineligible
because their income is $200 a month
or more.

Furthermore, he maintained, an-
other major cause of our present eco-
nomic system is the failure of money
to circulate. Under the Townsend
Plan, fully 85 per cent of $200 will
have to be spent within 30 days in or-
der to receive a. second check. The
remaining 15 per cent will’ be used for
personal expenses for which no ac-
count need be given.

In answering certain critics of the
Plan, who say that 25 billions of the
nation’s entire yearly income of 59
billions would be necessary to support
it. Mr. Brown continued that the
Plan aims to equalize as much as pos-
sible the nation’s wealth, and by cir-
culating this 25 billion yearly, accom-
plish this equalization,

Mr. Brown concluded his remarks
by pointing out that the necessary
cash for such an experiment in eco-
nomic planning could be met by a two

per cent tax on all transactions; this

to include taxes on bread, cigarettes,
stock transactions, and all other pur-
chases.

He again emphasized that the Town-
send Plan is not a pension system, but
is designed to relieve the unemploy-
ment situation, to get money into cir-
culation, and thus accomplish the
subsequent changes that such a re-
form would entail. ,

In response to a question: “Does
the Plan take in all the coordinating
elements that such a reform could in-
clude, such as co-operatives, and other
co-operative projects?” Mr, Brown re-
plied, “The Townsend Plan is all em-
bracing—there would be nothing to
prevent individuals from setting 11p co-
operative organizations, such as co-
operative buying and selling projects.”

As the bell rang, a question was
asked, “Why not give the young peo-
ple of our nation $1,000 a month, since
they could spend it faster than old
people, and the turn-over would be ﬁve
times as great?” Mr. Brown answered
this query by saying that people over
60 had worked all their lives, and were
entitled to a rest, while youth was
more in a position to work than were
the aged.

Sherrill To Make
Oil Field Su vey

 

4 Faculty  Rielceiveslippointment

From State Geological Survey

By. William Murray

Dr. Richard E. Sherrill, assistant
professor of geology, has been ap-
pointed by the Pennsylvania State
Geological Survey to make an,officia1
detailed geological survey of the oil
regions in northern Butler and Venan-
go County. -

Dr. Sherrill has been carrying on
research in this district for several
years for his own information, and
when the state decided to work out
a true geological occurrence of the
early oil ﬁelds, he was officially ap-
pointed. Such a survey has never
been made before, in spite of the fact
that oil was discovered in that dis-
trict prior to 1859.

Aside from the purely scientiﬁc na-
ture of the research, the Venango
County fields are historically impor-
tant, for it was there that the ﬁrst
drilled oil well in the world was dug
in 1859. Springs had been discovered
near Titusville, but the oil which seep-
ed out was not considered of any use
except as a mild medicinal agent.

In 1854, the ﬁrst company primarily
interested in oil was organized and
called the Pennsylvania Rock Oil
Company. Some of the members of
this organization formed their own
company, the Seneca Oil Company,
and in 1858 leased a plot of land on
Oil Creek, near Titusville. E. L.
‘Drake, the superintendent, engaged
two drillers and the ﬁrst well was
drilled the next year. This is the
famous Drake well, known through-
out the world.

A great deal of trouble was caused

Rosenson Claims
Students’ Scripts
Have Possibilities

“Prospects for something in the
way of a student-written Cap and
Gown show this year are mighty
good,” prophesied Bernard Rosenson,
’34, chairman of the graduate commit-
tee to assistant student script writers
following a meeting of the group Wed-
nesday night.

,The committee looked over three
sets of ideas for the show and found
some ﬁne qualities in each of them,
according to Rosenson.

One script, submitted by Theodore
Whitaker, C38, and Cyrus Speer, C38,
was thought by the committee to have
a ﬁne organization of plot.

Another script, again with collab-
orating authors, Nicholas Spanos, C39,

and Robert _Saff_ron,  was said to

excel ‘in dialo‘g'ué.””““"

Charles Foreman, graduate assist-
ant in the department of English, pre-
sented ideas for his show, but no com-
pleted work. The organization of
Foreman’s material was considered
good by the committee.

The favorable reaction of the com-
mittee is no deﬁnite indication that
any of the scripts will be accepted,
in whole or in part, for the show, it
was averred. The group will take
some time in considering the situa-
tion from all angles and presenting
its ﬁndings to the graduate produc-
tion committee, which will make the
ﬁnal choice.

The fact that the particular abilities
of the groups of authors dovetail so
nicely may lead ﬁnally to a show in
which the efforts of all will be com-
bined, it was indicated.

The week of April 20 has been ten-
tatively set as the date for this year‘s
show, according to Theodore W. Bid-
dle, graduate manager of Cap and
Gown.

I11 addition to Rosenson, the com-
mittee interviewing the student writ-
ers Wednesday included Louis
Fushan, ’23; John St. Peter, ’31; Gus
Schnabel, ’15; and Carl Swartz, ’34.

Peace Broadcasts

Two weekly radio programs dealing
with peace problems have been rec-
ommended to the campus by the
YVVCA Committee on International
Relations. 011 Wednesday evening at
10:45 o’clock, the CBS presents a 15-
minute program on “Our Foreign
Policy.” A dramatization, “World
Peaceways,” is scheduled for Thurs-
day nights from 9:30 to 10 o’clock.

Bureau Of Labor

Dr. Carroll Daugherty, professor
of economics in the School of
Business Administration, is going
on another leave of absence at the
end of the semester, his second
such leave in the past two years.

His last leave was to cooperate
on a survey of the iron and steel
industry, conducted by the Univer-
sity’s Bureau of Business Research
at the request of the Brookings In-
stitute.

This time it is the United States
Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the
project, of which he will be joint
managing director, is to determine
extent of displacement of labor by
machinery and managerial meth-
ods, and the increase in labor pro-
ductivity resulting or coincident,
in many of the nation’s outstand-
ing industries, among which will
be the boot a.nd shoe industry.

Centralization of his work will
be in Philadelphia, beginning at
the end of the current semester

and extending until October 1,
1936. _
Dr. Daugherty, a nationally

known expert on problems of labor
relations and labor statistics, has
just about completed his work on
the previous survey atrwhich he
was employed.

Daugherty For Industrial Survey

Statistics Calls

Under Dr. Ralph J. Watkins, di-
rector of the Bureau of ‘Business
Research and professor of statis-
tics, he investigated and computed
labor problems bearing on iron and
steel production. along with two
professional colleagues, one from
Harvard University, investigating
production, and the other from the
University of Virginia, doing re-
search on marketing, all three men
being on leave of absence from
their respective schools for one
and one—half years.

\Vork on the surveylasted from
February, 1934, until September,
1935. Results are expected to be
made public sometime this spring.

In the new survey, the Federal
Labor Statistics division will coop-
erate with the Federal Emergency
Relief Administration in determin-
ing wide ramiﬁcations of the prob-
lem.

According to Dr. Charles S. Tip-
petts, dean of the School of Busi-
ness Administration, and Dr. Ma-
rion K. McKay, head of the depart-
ment of economics, the four
courses in industry and economies
which Dr, Daugherty was to con-
duct next semester will deﬁnitely
be offered, although instructors
have not been named as yet.

Group Is Created  
To Poll Students
On Moot Subjects

Spirited Discussion And Unusual
Interludes Punctuate Lively
Monthly SFA Meeting

Amid a combination of ﬁery debate,
parliamentary objections, and some
really good wisecracks, Student Fac-
ulty Assembly adjourned late Tuesday
evening after its second long meet‘-
ing in succession.

Reports of newly created commit-
tees took up most of the time. but not
so much that. Charles B. Holstein;
C36, was prevented from bringing -up
for reconsideration the 21st..point<.on

last meeting.

Number 21, the creation of a group
to collect statistics and interpret stu-
dent opinion, was voted down by a.
large majority at the December
meeting. Introduced by Holstein, and
with the permission of William Har-
vey, C36, chairman, Leonard Seder‘,
C37, not a member of SFA, spoke in
defense of this committee. Announc-
ing that, along with Herbert Rackoff,
C38, he had taken a poll of student
opinion on a subject chosen at ran-
dom, he showed ﬁgures to prove its
accuracy and feasibility . A motion by
Holstein to pla.ce the selection of
questions and the collection and in-
terpretation of, data. in the hands of-a.
committee of ﬁve students and two
faculty members was defeated, 12-11,
But a motion by David Racusin, C37,

power to pass upon ‘questions for .sur-
veys changed one vote, and the mo-
tion was passed. ’ ' ,, _ "

“Reminiscent Of Newsreel" .

Concerning the activities of the
committee, Cliarles _Hera.ld_,
C36, chairman, was not over-enthusia_s‘-
:19. said Heizaiaz. .“Eve.rr_ tiine‘ I.,.bie4
gin to consider the s-ubject of extra-

year’s newsreel theater.” - He suggest-
ed evening meetings of two to three
hours in length with two or more
speakers. The assembly voted 'to give
the forum committee permission to
go ahead and get speakers, but was
not sympathetic with the idea for
evening meetings. Israel Goldberg,
C36, was especially vocal in arguing-
for afternoon fomms.

As chairman of the Sub-Freshmanu.

ed that the affair be held in conjunc-.-
tion with Tap Day‘ on--lvlay 1 as- was-
tdone last year. _ Since it was the com-—

Discuss School Of Pharmacy

Hubert Teitlebaum, (J37, chairman.*
of the committee to investigate the
alleged isolation of. ‘the:- School of’

Pharmacy, reported that this isolation:
is present t.o a much lesser degree-*
than is apparent. Dance committees
include pharmacy students, Owls and
Panthers are circulated there, and, ac-
cording to Dr. Leonard O'Connell,
dean of the school, only a misunder-
standing between The Pitt News. and
pharmacy authorities has prevented a
like circulation of the newspaper.
Teitlebaum, however, suggested
that perhaps two pharmacy students
should be given seats in SFA, This

recommendation, being contrary to
SFA’s constitution, was not acted
upon.

A suggestion from Barbara Thomas,
BA37, as co-chairman of the calendar
committee, that the social committee
be enlarged to handle the work of
setting a deﬁnite calendar for school
activities was referred to the social_
committee after a long discussion on

Radio Rebuttals

3' N ‘MONDAY AFTERNOON two representa-

tives of the University Men ’s Debating Asso-

ciation will go on the air over a national
radio network. \Vithin the same hour, two debat-
ers from.Stanford University will broadcast their
arguments in opposition.

 Although Pitt debaters several times have been
heard on radio‘ broadcasts, Monday ’s events will be
their ﬁrst chance on a. national network. Those
who have been interested in the remarkable recent
progress of this University activity are pleased to
regard it as another step upward.

Collegiate debating. it seems, has traveled a very
rocky road. Audiences at such a contest seldom
found convincing the powerful phrases and ges-
tures of showmanship of college boys led on by the
lure of victory. Garbled facts and strategic sen-
tences tended to cover the whole business with an
aroma. of insincerity and often held such contests
up to ridicule.

Years ago the University organization decided
that by doing away with the practice of awarding
a verdict, much of this ill effect was removed.
VVith the exception of occasions when applause of
the audience decided the winning team, Pitt de-
baters have seldom in the past decade participated
in decision debates. The systeiii has found increas-
ing favor. Sides are chosen arbitrarily and the
‘entire situation takes on a more sincere and mature
‘nianner.

. Debating at the Uiiiversity amounts to much
more than an annual rampage through the country
by two squad members and a coach. Other stu-
dents engage in scores of debates before high
school, civic, and social orgaiiizations, all of which
certainly results in increased good will for the Uni-
versity. Members of the debating organization
probably engage in more competition than any ath-
jdetic team at the Uiiiversit_v. Likewise, there is the
‘interesting point that upon the conclusion of the
.coming southern trip, Pitt debaters will have

atoiiclied everystate in the Union.

There is little doubt that Mr. \V. M. Parrish has

~m.ade the University a power in the constantly im-

Praise Goes Round And Round
RECOGNITION FOR ONE of the University’s

outstanding organizatioiis, the famous Pitt
Band, was given Tuesday night when Ed-
ward Vose Babcock, former mayor of Pittsburgh
and member of the board of trustees of the Uni-
versity,"p-layed host to the organization, its leaders,
‘and special guests at a dinner in the Faculty Club.

At that time, it is quite certain, adequate Words
of praise were showered upon the marching musi-
cians who, both by their marching and their music,
were considerably more than an attraction during
the past football season. Although many days
have passed by since then, the excellence of the
band in its maneuvers the past year is still fresh
in the mind andthe immense hit the boys made at
the Polo Grounds in New York should be a meni-
ory long cherished among members of the organ-
ization.

Mr. Babcock’s gesture Tuesday night takes on
even more signiﬁcance when it is recalled that he
donated the ﬁrst uniforms for the band some years
ago. His continued interest in the organization,
which this year, especially, has won country-wide
recognition, should be a source of pride on the
part of band members, officers, and of the general
student body. It should also be indicative of the
attitude of the public toward student achievement
in this important phase of extra-curricular activity.

Students who insist that the pre—exain rush has
them standing on their heads will be happy to
know that a Nebraska professor claims you can
think better that way.

Not Bad!

The matrimonial devotion of a Buffalo professor re-
sults in his holding special classes in his home. Stu-
dents objected, on the grounds that the instructor had a
perfectly satisfactory office on campus in which to hold
the extra sessions. The professor's only excuse for his
action is that he “loves his wife.”

Collegiate
It is the custom at Louisiana State to stage an annual
wild west show, with bronco-busting, steer—roping, bull-
dogging, and fancy riding. An innovation this year is a
cow-milking contest with the object to fill a pop bottle
instead of a pail. This makes for much sport, they say.

Fur Gosh Sakes!

Doctors in the student healtli service at the University
of Kansas have just issued a warning to young ladies to
look for gri-ppe germs in their fur neck pieces and fur
muffs.

   

The Real Lowdown

Some interesting facts were learned through a survey
at Catholic University in VVashington. The majority of
35 seniors in one class say they will pick the type that
dad loved for their life companions. Only one man said
that “good looks” would determine his choice of a wife,
while 11 said that “moral character” would inﬂuence
them most. Wealth did not seem to matter much. One
mentioned it as a last consideration.

College women did not seem to be in such demand as
educators would like to believe, in this vote. A deﬁnite
distinction was made between “intelligence” and “educa-
tion.” The vote showed the seniors considered intelli-
gence necessary for their wives, while not admitting
that a college girl and a smart girl were identical.

An_ Idea
The Chicago Daily Maroon announced a contest with
a billiard table being given to the fraternity selling the
most subscriptions to the Ca.p and Gown, the year book.

Dramatic Interlude ‘

A student at Harvard, coming back after the Thanks-
giving va.cation, just barely made his ﬁrst class by going
to the lecture directly from the train, before even put-
ting his bags in his room. The lecture was too much for
him, however, and he gently dozed off. "Noticing this,
the watchful professor walked up beside the student and,
in the approved conductors’ fasliion. yelled, “Ba.ck Bay
Station.”

Engineering Group Exhibits

Booth At ARBA Convention

As part of their activity as the ﬁrst
student branch of the American Road
Builders’ Association, a group of civil
engineering students. will leave Tues-
day to attend ‘the~Association’s Road
Show in Cleveland. The group, 30*
companied by Adelbert Diefendorf,
associate professor of engineering, iii-
tends to spend two days in Cleve-
land. ,

The local student branch is not only
the ﬁrst to be associated with the
ARBA, it is also the ﬁrst to have a
booth at one of the Shows. The ex-
hibit at Cleveland is a three-paneled
display of photographs depicting its
activities.

The center panel of the display por-
trays campus scenes. The most out-
standing of these pictures is an en-
larged view of the Cathedral. An-
other picture is of the entire student
chapter.

The left panel depicts life at Camp
Hamilton. In this, many of the civil
engineering students are shown while
engaged in camp life. The other
panel of the display shows students
conducting tests in the highways
laboratory.

Rome Addresses
Sociology Class

Former Assistant To Dean Speaks
On Juvenile Court Functions

\Valter J. Rome, former assistant
to the dean of men, and present su-
perintendent of the Juvenile Delin-
quency Home, spoke ‘Wednesday aft-
ernoon to a group of sociology stu-
dents on the system and program of
the Juvenile, Court. The talk was
given before the Juvenile Delinquency
class of Dr. Walter A. Lunden, assist-
ant professor of sociology.

Mr. Rome described the present set-
up of his organization and the func-
tions of the three divisions: Juvenile
Home, Probation Department, and
Foster Home Department.

The present building, he said, will
be torn down as soon as the new one.
built farther back on the same- plot
on Forbes Street, is ﬁnished. This
new building will house all the de-
partments, including schoolrooms,
and will be built in the shape of an
H, like the Falk Clinic. Playgrounds
are planned to replace the old struc-
ture. _

In tracing the history of the Ju-
venile Court, Mr. Rome called atten-
tioii to the fact that Judge Gustave
L. Scliramm, former professor of po-
litical science at the University, was
elected ﬁrst oﬂicial of the group when
it was organized in 1933.

 

VVisconsin Congressman

To Talk On Third Parties

On Monday evening, in Schenley
High School, the Pittsburgh Commun-
ity Forum will present the Honorable
Thomas R. Amlie, congressman from
lVisconsin, who will speak on “Why
VVe Need a New Political Party.”

Representative Amlie was one of
the leaders of the convention of_third
party synipathizers, held in Chicago,
last summer. He is reputed to be one
of the outstanding liberals in Con-
gress at the present time, and is an
authority on third party trends in
the United States today.

Dr. Bernard C. _Claiisen, pastor of
the First Baptist Church, will preside.
All students and faculty members are

plays at this Road Show. According
L0 American Road Builder, the oﬂicial
magazine of the Association, “Exhibi-
tors at the ARBA Road Show com-
pose the-‘Who’s VVho’ of the Ameri-
can highway industry. Products
cover everything used in the con-
struction and maintenance of roads
and streets.”

Although the civil engineering de-
partment has been afliliated withthe
Association since 1933, it has just be-
come prominently active. It was
through the efforts of Alfred Barr,
CE36, that it is taking part in the
Cleveland convention.

Attending the convention are John
Fogarty, 36, president of the student
branch; Joseph Scott, 37, vice presi-
dent; Barr. secretary-treasurer; and

Foreign Service
Jobs Are Scarce,
S a y s S h u m a 1: e

Opportunities In Other Phases
Of Government Are Greater,
Curtis Club Is Informed

“Attractive though foreign service
is to the student who seeks a cosmo-
politan polish and who is attracted
by its allure. chances to land a posi-
tion in this branch of our goverii-
ment are slim, indeed.”

Thus spoke Dr. Roger V. Shumate,
instructor in political scieiioe, to gov-
ernment service students at the ﬁrst
regular meeting of the George VV.
Curtis Club, ‘Wednesday, in Alumni
Hall.

The diplomatic and consular
branches of the Department, of State
contain, from clerk to ambassador,
only 3,600 positions, he said.

Also, he continued, before Septem-
ber. 1935, when 43 appointments were
made to the foreign service, no posi-
tions had been distributed for four
years. At best, only 40-60 appoint-
ments a year can be expected.

Personnel Increased

Dr. Shiimate declared that oppor-
tunities in the government service for
college-trained men and, women are
better now than they ever have been
in the past. “At the close of 1935,
the personnel of the national admin-
istration was increasing at the rate
of 5.000 new employes a month. Since
the trends of government policy con-
tinue along a deﬁnite path regardless
of the party in power, this great in-
crease in government employment
offers the greatest hope to college-
traiiied students, despite the fact that
politics has not been entirely eliminat-
ed.

“The government is giving more
recognition to university graduates.
especially those trained -in» political
science, economics, and sociology.
Though the need for trained adminis-
trative officials is acute, few agencies
have been established through which
to contact such persons. That is why
the possibilities for a position de-
pend as much upon the political sci-
ence department of the University as
upon oneself. The department has
been active. in making connections in
order to obtain positions.”

Tests For College Students

The Civil Service Commission has
recently established a junior civil
service examination which is being
given only to students who have had
at least two years college training.
Those who succeed in the tests are
eligible for placement in any branch
of general nature in the national
civil‘ service.

Modern reform in the service was
instituted by George W. Curtis, in
whose honor the club for government
service students was named. His re-
form movement was set into opera-
tion just after the Civil War, when to
criticize the Republican party, accord-
ing to Dr. Shumate, was to rank as a
rebel in criticising the United States
governinent. »

New Committees
Report Progress

(Continued From Page One)

Dr. S. P. Franklin, professor of re-
ligion and religious. education. His re-
port stated that h’-: committee would
decide something definite about the
recominendation of new courses in the
near future.

Concerning the c--cation of a Men’s
Council, Jaines Iiicliolas, chairman,
expressed some lac‘: of understanding
as to whetlier tll”'."_‘ really is a need
for some sort of men’s Ol'g‘£l1llZatlO1l
similar to the VVS5‘ \, and as to what
his coniniitfee she‘ ‘'1 do about creat-
ing one. Ruth Anderson, -Ed36, ex-
pressed the woinc»:i’s viewpointwlieii
she emphasized the need for a sepa-
rate men’s organizaitioii to take care
of problems peculiar only to men stu-
dents, without bothering the women.
SFA recommended that Nicholas’
committee draw up a plan of work
which the Men’s Council might carry
out, and also a set of machinery for
creating the Council. , '

Scholarship Pamphlet P‘repared

Irene Matveak, C37, reporting for
the newsreel committee, stated that
surveys have been begun on the possi-
bility of obtaining a projector, on the
operating expenses involved, and on
the present status of campus news-
reels theaters, particularly at the
University of Minnesota.

The committee headed by Alan
Lloyd. Ed36, a group created for the
purpose of publicizing all sorts of.
University and exchange scholarships,
reported that it had prepared a 24-
page pamphlet, and was instructed
by SFA to print it if possible, in any
event, the body was asked to publish
it in mimeographed form.

Goldberg. chairman of the Scholar's
Day committee, reported that Me-
morial Hall is being repaired by the
WPA a.nd that the work is progress-
ing so slowly that the hall may not
be available for March 13, the date
previously chosen.

Meeting Ends Suddenly

The status of Vvalter Hart, D37,
tlien‘came- up for discussion. Elected
as a junior representative to the as-
sembly iii the spring elections, Hart,
it was alleged, attended only the open-
ing meeting of the year, a dinner
meeting- He was also present when
the SFA Picture was taken forthe
Owl. SFA agreed to send him a let-
ter asking him to explain his position
and to show reason why he has been
absent from every important meet-
ing. ,

Just as Goldberg asked for the ﬂoor
to discuss new business, which, in-
cidentally, had not been called for
the meeting was unexpectedly adjourn-
ed. Goldberg walked out under pro-
test, but everyone else did too, so
his action wasn't noticed. The meet-
ing took place in the somewhat
cramped quarters of the conference
room of Room 801, "Cathedral.

Fighters To Open Season  
With Week-End Engagements

 

Wrestlers Seek To Avenge
Former Loss Tonight
At Waynesburg

By Harold W. Byers

There will be plenty of action at
Waynesburg tonight when the Panth-
er matmen open the season with the
Yellowjackets. Tonight will also
mark the debut of Coach Mazeski as
leader of the Blue and Gold wrestlers.

The Panthers are eager to avenge
the 22-8 lacing they took at the hands
of the ‘Waynesburg outﬁt last year.
Only two Pitt men were able to come
out of last year’s match winners. One
was Russ Bedillion, who tossed Pa-
lone in 2 minutes and 26 seconds, and
the other Panther winner was Bill

class by defeating Magyar in 2 min-
utes, 20 second time advantage.

All the other matches of that meet
went to the Yellowjackets. Bradley
won for them in the 118-pound class
by trimming Babcock in a time ad-
vantage of 6 minutes and 5 seconds.
VVainwright threw Cover in 2 minutes,
26 seconds, and Tornabene won the
155-pound division match on a default
from Neibel.

Waynesburg continued to put on
the pressure and won the following
bout when Bartaletti defeated George
in another time advantage. Showing
a variety of holds, Scott trimmed Wil-
lets in a 3 minute, 30 seconds time ad-
vantage. In the last match of the
evening, Sullivan won a 2-minute, 9-
second time advantage over burly Len
Rector.

Yellowjacket Veterans Return

In tonight’s match, ﬁve members of
the Yellowjacket team that fared so
well against the Panthers last year
will be seen in action again. Bradley",
Tornabene, Palone, Bartaletti and
Sullivan are the ﬁve boys who are
anxious to repeat.

Graduation was not so good to
Coach Mazeski, as there will be many
new faces in the Panther lineup to-
night. Only Captain Russ Bedillion,
Lyle Thurston, and Harold Neibel
saw action last year.

Tonight’s match will mark the sec-
ond contest of the season for the Yel-
lowjackets. In their opening engage-
ment they were nosed out by the
strong West Virginia team, 17-13. In
this match the Waynesburg light-
weight men showed plenty of stuff
and were responsible for the Yellow-
jackets holding an early 13-8 lead. At
this point the Mountaineer “beef-
trust” stepped in to capture the last
three bouts and win the match.

Coach Mazeski will probably use
Eugene Cartwright in the 118-pound
division this evening. He will trade
holds with the experienced Bradley
from Vvaynesburg. -, In the -125-pound
class Rudy Tomorrelli of Pitt, will
meet Hutchins of Waynesburg. Cap-
tain Russ Bedillion will match his
wits against the wiry Palone, in an
attempt to pin him again.

Neibel Meets Tornabene

Tricky Lyle Thurston will meet a
newcomer on the Waynesburg squad
in Ornorff in the 155-pound class. Har-
old Neibel will be out for revenge for
last year’s forfeited match to Torna-
bene, the high-class Vvaynesburg grap-
pier, There will be plenty of tangling
and untangling when slippery George
Semenofl‘ of Pitt takes on Bartaletti.
One of the highlights of the evening
will be in the 175—pound class, when
burly Luther Richards takes on Sulli-
van, a. consistant winner in the past
two years.

Witli the rest of his lineup pretty
well settled, Coach Mazeski is having
considerable trouble with his heavy-
weights. Tony Matisi probably will
not wrestle, being not yet in the best
of condition. Alex Kodoshov may
not enter the ring because of a should-
er injury received in practice. Who-
ever Coach Mazeski picks for the
heavyweight class will ﬁnd plenty of
trouble with Waynesburg’s represen-
tative, Cummings.

The coach, seven wrestlers, and
Manager Jimmy Datillo will leave at
2 o'clock this afternoon for Waynes-
burg. They will return immediately
following the match.

Sherrill To Make .
Oil Field Survey

by the caving in of surface rocks, and
ﬁnally Drake hit upon the idea of
driving an iron tube through the
quicksand and clay on the surface.
Vvhen the drill had gone down 69 feet,
it dropped suddenly into a crevice.
The following day, oil was found to
have been struck. The first produc-
tion was a yield of 25 barrels, Later
the amount dropped to 15 barrels, and
the total for the year was 200 barrels.

Upon the discovery of this great
source of oil, which by now had been
found to be of immense economic
value, all the available land along the
Allegheny River was leased, and
other companies rapidly organized.
Many cities sprang up, including Oil
City, and the population of the sec-
tion suddenly swelled. Some of the
wells yielded thousands of barrels
daily, ﬂowed for a month or two, and
then died out because of the congeal-
ing of paraffin in the hole.

The early wells declined as rapidly
as they had sprung up, and the pros-
pering cities built around them be-
came deserted. Pithole, in Venango
County, was one of the most notable
of these temporary cities. In an in-
credibly short time, the population
rose to 14,000, and its post office was
second only to Pittsburgh and Phila-
delphia. Within two years nothing
but the site was left, and today it is
not even indicated on maps.

Dr. Sherrill’s work is done on a co-
operative basis, and is expected to re-
veal much about the stratigraphy and
structure of the rock beds in the Ve-
Ilango County ﬁelds.

Syracuse Awaits Invasion
By Panther Mittmen
Tomorrow Night

By James McCormick
Tomorrow night the Panther mitt-
men will usher in the 1936 boxing sea-
Son When they meet the Orange box-

ers at Syracuse.

The Panthers entrain tonight at
11:30‘ o’clock and are scheduled to ar-
rive in Syracuse early tomorrow morn-
ing. They plan to return late the
same night after the matches.

Either Mike Sivak or Russ Vogel,
115-pounders, will draw one starting
assignment for the Jungle Cats. Who-
ever is chosen will likely meet Frank
Cimicata, substitute for Captain Mul-

Hinchberger, who won the 126-pound: £11115’ who has been dec med mehgl

Cimicata lacks only in experi-
ence and should put up a good ﬁght.

In the second match of the evening
Al Paslowski will most likely wear a
Pitt uniform against Al Duke, Syra-
cuse 125-pounder. puke is another
substitute and will concede size and
weight to Paslowski.

Abe Konick, diminutive Panther
pugilist, mills with Fred Zuccaro in
the 135-pound event. Zuccaro is a
new addition to the Orange team, but
should give Abe a good match.

Herb Cummings, who ﬁnally step-
ped out in front in the 145-pound se-
lections, will meet Johnny Mastrella,
Syracuse. Scrappy elimination match-
es marked the selection of Cummings
for the position, and he should give a
good account of himself tomorrow
night. Mastrella is a another new ad-
dition to the Orange squad, being
hailed as one of the ﬁnest boxers ever
to enter that University.

‘George Dines, sterling Panther box-
er, will ﬁnd Art MvGivern opposing
him in the. 155-pound encounter. Mc-
Givern is inter-collegiate champion in
this class.

Mixing blows in the 165-pound divi-
sion will be Art Leonard, Panther
sophomore, and 0rd Fink, Syracuse
star. In the next weight class, Cleon
Linderman, blond Pitt battler, will
trade haymakers with Jack Lipani,
who has replaced Captain Ray Jefferis
in this group.

Jefferis was moved up one notch to
the heavyweight post to ﬁll a vacancy
created by graduation. Either Frank
Patrick or Ted Schmidt will square
off against the Orange veteran in the
ﬁnal setto of the evening. If Patrick's
as handy with his dukes as he is with
his educated foot, Jeﬁeris will be in
for a busy evening.

The mittmen, headed by Coach Jack
Schricker, are rated the position of
underdogs against the well-balanced
Syracuse club, "but perhaps the fact
that it’s Schricker’s birthday may
have a cannonading effect on the
boxers. ‘ "

Last year Schricker’s boys put up
a game battle against the New York-
ers, losing a 61/2-11/2 decision. How-
ever that was last year, and tomorrow
evening may bring a different result
altogether.

Four intramural
Champs Crowned

Turner, Caruso, Durand, Horton
Win Novice Tournament Titles

Novice boxers are novices. After
the ﬁnal bell sounded Wednesday and
the tape was unwound from the hands
of four Intramural champions, the
ﬁrst taste of real ri11g experience was
tucked under the belt of just as many
embryonic ﬁghtmen.

Although no white hope to stop the
punches of Joe Louis appeared, sev-
eral promising pugilists were uncov-
ered during the tourney. None of the
title-winners were in the ring for the
ﬁrst time, but for three ﬁnalists it
was only the beginning,

Uncovered was a Golden Gloves
ﬁnalist from North Carolina, Herb
Turner. This lad holds quite a repu-
tation in amateur competition back
in his home state, and in the Intra-
mural tournament backed up that rep-
utation in great style.

Turner won the 1- 145-pound’ cham-
pionship by outpointing Tommy Mc-
Kenna in a hard-fought match. Tur-
ner’s consistent jabbing easily got the
nod for the ﬁrst two rounds. In the
third, both men squared off and start-
ed throwing rights and lefts with
abandon. Splitting even in this
round, Turner was given the verdict
by virtue of his early lead.

The 135-pound title went to Ralph
Caruso in the closest battle of the
tourney. In the opening round Ca-
ruso rushed off to a quick start and
foored Herman Laub for a seven
count. Laub didn't fully recover un-
til the third round when he came back
with a fury of lefts that sent Caruso
to the ropes. Laub had Caruso set
for the knockout punch, but was un-
able to land a ﬁnishing blow with his
right hand due to an injured thumb.

This tourney was Laub’s initial ad-
venture into the squared ring, and
he gave a good account of himself. In
his preliminary match he kayoed his
opponent in the second round, and
gave a good account of himself
against the more-seasoned Caruso.

Ralph Durand copped the 125-pound
crown by eliminating another rookie,
Walter Cavalier, in a decision bout.‘
Durand swept through every round
with apparent ease. Cavalier took a
count of nine in the ﬁrst round and
another of six in the second, but
managed to stay on his feet until the
end.

In the remaining bout, Horton de-
feated Clark to annex the 155-pound
championship. This was a decision
match, with Horton winning on
points.

Winner does not take all in this
competition although the champions
will receive the gold medals. To each
runner-up will go a silver Intramural
panther award.

Panther ‘Pullman Cagers’
Tac_l__(l£ Georgetown Tonight

Third Road-Trip Shows
Varsity Challenging
Lions Saturday

By William K. Trosen

Back on the Pullmans again after a
disastrous two game stay at home, Dr.
Carlson and his Panther basketeers
open their short three-day road tour
tonight in Washington, D. C., against
an Eastern Intercollegiate Conference
rival, the Georgetown Hoya ﬁve.

The Golden Panther party left
Pittsburgh last night for the Capital
City. Immediately following the game
tonight they will move over to State
College for the second and conclud-
ing game of the trip, facing the Pe11n
State Lions tomorrow evening in an-
other conference billing.

But taking the cagers’ worries one
at a time, in tonight’s battle with the
Hoyas the Panther ﬁve will be out to
break a two-game losing streak, some-
thing out of the ordinary for a Pitt
cageteam. Not for years have the
Cats pulled a trick like that, and to-
night they will aim to prove to
Georgetown that it was not all in fun.

Georgetown, on the other hand, al-
ready owns one defeat in a league tilt,
that by Temple earlier in the season,
and they will be out to improve their
conference standing. The Hoyas of
this season are much improved over
last year’s ﬁve. Several promising
sophomores have stepped into the
vacant spots left by graduation. Mike
Petrosky at center, Tommy Nolan at
guard, and Eddie Bassin, at forward,
have practically cinched varsity posts.

At the other two positions, Don
Gibeau at a forward post and Ben
Zola as the other guard are varsity
holdovers from last year. In the
games thus far the Hoyas have been
hindered more through inexperience
than anything else. Once they become
familiar with Coach Fred Mesmer’s
system and work as a unit, George-
town will be a real threat to other
conference teams.

Moving from VVashington to State
College, the Panthers take on the State
Lions Saturday night. The travel-
ing should not hurt the boy’s chances,
for up until now, the Golden Cats
could be fittingly titled “Pittsburgh's
Pullman Players.” Of the eight
games played on the road, the Pan-
thers have taken seven, yet in the
three games at the Stadium they have
dropped two. All of which is far
from the usual run of things, the
usual being to win at home and lose
on trips.

’Against the State ﬁve, the Panthers
will face a much more formidable op-

The Lions have only dropped one
game thus fa.r this season, losing a
close game to Navy’s crack ﬁve last
week in Annapolis for their lone de-
feat. Last season, in a. game that
was the ﬁrst in nine years between
the Lions and the Panthers, the Pitts-
burgh team easily romped to a 41-25
victory.

In the game tomorrow night, the
State team will probably start the
same lineup used in the Navy clash
last week. J. Smith and Miehoff will
take their places at forwards, Riley
will be at center, and a pair of vet-
erans, Mike Kornick and Frank Smith,
will play against the Panther for-
wards.. Kornick has led the State
scoring in every game this year.

It isn't much use -trying to ﬁgure
out the starting Panther lineup for
these two games, for as sure as it is
done, Dr. Carlson will start a different
combination. Both Rags Radvansky
and Miles Zeleznick looked good even
in defeat against the Notre Dame and
Tech ﬁves, a.nd they stand a ﬁne
chance of getting the nod.

The starting combination for a ma-
jority of the 12 games has had Captain
Ted Roderick and Billy Jesko at the
forwards, Joe Garcia at center, and
Bob Johnson and Ed Spotovich at the
guards.
has pepped up immensely in the last
two games and may replace Garcia
at the tip-off. Then there’s Radvan-
sky and Zeleznick, too, so that about
the only sensible thing to do is to
wait and look in the morning paper-
for the starting team. One thing is
certain, that all of the players men-
tioned will see plenty of action. Ten
men will round out the traveling
party, the other two being Frank
Loucks and Luke Rowe, both of whom
will probably be in there, too.

Swimmers M e et
Delaware Tonight

Coach Pat Corr’s varsity swimmers
swing back into action this evening
when they meet the University of
Delaware’s team in a dual meet at
the Metropolitan pool. This will be
their ﬁrst start in their quest for the
Eastern Intercollegiate Swimming As-
sociation title.

The easterners, walloped last winter

on their homecrrounds, hope to turn
the tables on Pitt this season. On the
other hand, the Panthers, having lost
by a lopsided margin to Ohio State’s
powerful squad, hope to balance the
season budget by taking the Delaware
lads into camp.
For the Blue and Gold, Coach Corr
will probably rely on the same lineup
which faced the Buckeyes last Sat-
urday. In that event, Captain Russ
Lindberg, Bill Norton, Bob Prince,
and Harry Geyer will handle the
sprint events while Tom Locke and
Jim Lavine will participate in the 220
and 440-yard freestyle contests.

George Myers and Harry Geyer
will be entered in the fancy diving
event, with Anderson, and Stiranko
or Prince likely starters in the 200-
yard breaststroke race. Joe Jones
will be Pitt’s hope in the backstroke
race.

The freshman team, after stepping
off on the wrong foot, will attempt to
even‘ up its record against Turtle
Creek high’s aggregation. Turtle
Creek lost to the Carnegie Tech
yearling ‘last week by a large score,
while the frosh werebeing defeated
by Fifth Avenue.

Both meets will be held at the same
time, the events being alternated. The
water carnival will begin at 8:15.

Senior Bacteriology Student Devises
Traps For Roaches, Not For Rodents

Calling all roaches! Calling all

roaches!

Thus runs the urgent -plea of \Vil-
liam Sulzbacher, C36, whose life has
become one long search for bigger
and better roaches. Sulzbacher is
making a study of the intestinal bac-
teria found in roaches for his bac-
teriology class. technically known as
Biology 141. So far he has been chief-
ly handicapped by not having enough
insects to work with and consequent-
ly is asking for help from outsiders
who may have acquired spare roaches
somewhere.

Several traps have been devised by
Sulzbacher to catch the roaches, but
so far none of them has been as suc-
cessful, he reports, as simply picking
up the victims in his hands. Cutting
a roach up to remove the intestine
proves to be a ticklish job, too, the
ﬁrst roach he caught escaping just
when he was about to begin the oper-
ation.

Roaches, the rest of the bacteri-
ology class claim, are -all very well i11
their way, but they don’t have the
friendly and lovable spirit shown by
the pet rabbits kept in the laboratory
for experimental injections. Star
member of the rabbit colony is Cleo-
patra, whose life is supervised jointly
by Rhea Klein, C36, and Blanche
Shore, C36. Cleopatra’s love life has
been such a hectic one that now she
is kept more or less invseclusion, with

only Sister Esmeralda beside her to
keep her company.

Sister Esmerelda is a phlegmatic
rabbit, interested chiefly in chewing
chunks of cantaloupe and licking the
spot where somebody dropped pink
dye on her.

“Now C1eo,” claimed Miss Klein,
“is altogether different. Shes not
only the most popular of the rabbits
but also is much the cleverest.” At
that particular moment Cleo was en-
gaged in violently tossing her food
tray from one side of her cage to the
other, her daily dozen to keep down
her weight.

Other rabbits include Blunder, who,
according to its owner, La Rue \Valk-
er, is “just one big mistake;” Sey-
mour, the North=Side rabbit; and Or-
bin, 'Cleo’s chief admirer.
