.|nquiryDetermining Fate of a President 

By SCOTT MACLEOD

' “I don’t need to stress again. the impor-
tance of our undertaking and the decency,
and principle which we must bring to it.
We understand our high. constitutional re-
sponsibility. We will faithfully live up to
it.” ‘

With that, Peter W. Rodino,_Chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee, official-
ly began the hearings intojwhether there
are sufficient grounds to impeach Richard
Nixon, 37th President of the United States.

Never has an’American ‘president been
removed from office through the impeach-
ment process.-Only Andrew Johnson has
been impeached, and the odors left from
his historic experience smell sharply of
partisanship. To date, there is no evidence
to‘support diehard partisanship in the Nix-
on impeachment inquiry. The Judiciary
Committee realizes that it must, and it
will, only compile data and‘ evidence that

-comprise. serious charges against the

President. The seriousness of the process
leaves no room for partisan politics.

And although the President has made
bids to avoid impeachmentwith recent
public image campaigns, which some ob-
servers have likened to the 1952 Checkers
Speech, it seems that the President is on
an ill-fated course that will ultimately lead

to a vote on impeachment in the House of

Representatives.

On April 25, Chief Counsel John Doar of
the impeachment inquiry announced that
the staff was concentrating on seven areas
of alleged presidential misconduct which
could determine the fate of the President.

The first area is the breakin and cover-

 

up of the Watergate burglary. According
to the Senate testimony of John Dean, for-
mer counsel to the President, the Presi-
dent was made aware of his aides involve-

/

ment in the coverup in September, 1972.

The committee is investigating whether or _

not the President approved actions by_his
aides to hide the facts.

TUESDAY, MAY 21, 1974,‘ .i

The committee is also interested in.-

knowing whether or not the President was

 

  
  

 

 

made aware of hush money payments to v_ 

Howard Hunt and other Watergate con-
spirators to buy their silence.

Whetheror not the President was aware
that Jeb Mcgruder, a former deputy cam— _
paign aide. perjured himself during the;

trial of the original Watergate defendpants. V 

is.another concern of the inquiry.

The staff is also studying the events
which led to the firing of Archibald. Cox,

the first Special Prosecutor, and the res- \. T .
. ignation of Attorney General Elliot Rich-

ardson.
And destruction of evidence is the ques-

tion in_the incident of the 181/2 minute gap ' 5'.

under investigation by the committee staff.

Was the President in the obliteration of j i

this tape?

The second area is domestic surveil- A
lance. This White House problem beganw
with the formation of the “plumbers” ’

which was motivated byDaniel Ellsberg’s
leaking of the Pentagon Papers to The
New York Times.

The unit is responsible for the breakin

‘at the office of Ellsberg’s psychiatrist in A ;
Los Angeles: The President withheld in-
formation from authorities when he found E’

out about the breakin. ‘

The staff is also investigating the al-
leged wiretapping of officials and report- '-

ers. and about offering the directorship of 

the FBI to the judge presiding over thé
Ellsberg case. . W '

The third area is personal finances. This ' H

J" “The Commons, as the grand
, Inquest of the nation, becomes the
, uitors for penal justice. The
general course is to pass a
\"resolution containing a criminal
fcharge against the supposed
' delinquent, and then to direct some
_member to impeach him by oral
V accusation at the bar of the House
'jof.J.ords, in _the name of the
Commons.”
I -So begins an impeachment
proceeding, according to Jeffer-
Hson’s Manual, a document pre-
pared by Thomas Jefferson for his
grown‘ guidance as President of the
,._:Senate in the years of his

"by the House of Representatives,
-the manual governs the House in
all cases_ in which its provisions are
(applicable and in which they are
" not inconsistent with the standing
rules and orders of the House.

But in the case of Richard Nixon,
' 37th president of the United States.
it is the House of Representatives
which will become the grand
_ inquest, and he might well be
impeached by oral accusation in the
chamber of the Senate in the name
of the House.

-As the impeachment proceeding
has matured in the House Judiciary
A Committee, chaired by New Jersey
Democrat Peter Rodino, Jr.
public has become increasingly
familiar with the workings of the
. committee, and the procedures and
rules which have guided their
‘ actions.
But what happens next?
. The Committee, technically,
_after concluding its investigation
 and hearings. will vote on whether
. or not to recommend the impeach-
. ment of the President to the full
v House by way of reporting articles
1 of impeachment.
' If the Committee reports im-
T peachment, the articles of im-
‘ peachment will subsequently be
jg presented on the House floor for

3 the purpose of debate and a vote of

yeas and nays. A majority vote for
, impeachment will initiate a trial in
the '\Senate. A vote against

' impeaching the President would
,'mean either dropping the inquiry

completely or resuming it again in
A committee.

Close observers of the inquiry
predict the Judiciary Committee
will conclude its investigation by
June 30, and on approximately
August 1, after 30 days of

and debating them on the floor, the
House will_ take a vote of
impeachment. ‘
Immediately following a positive
vote on impeachment, the House

House shall appoint." one, two, or
even ﬁve managers to carry the
articles, in obedience to a House
resolution, to the bar of the Senate.
It will most likely be Representa-
tive Peter Rodino, chairman of
the Judiciary Committee, who
will read to the Senate the articles
of impeachment, beginning:
“These are the articles exhibited
by the House of Representatives of
the United States, in the name of
themselves and all the people of
the United States, against Richard
Nixon, President of the United
States, in maintenance and support

seem complete enough, if not
picayune.

Although those procedures are
precise, at least one key figure in
the impeachment process is not
quite sure of his role. lnsisting he
has not yet received instructions
from his superiors, who will
ultimately be the Chief Justice,
William Wannall, Sargent-"at-Arms
of the US Senate said, “All I know
is what I read in Newsweek.”

"As far as» crying, ‘Hear Ye,
Hear Ye, All those present are
called to order, the Senate will now
hear the impeachment of the
President,‘ well. all loan say is that
was 105 years ago in the Johnson
trial." ‘

In a thick Southern draw],
Wannall said all he knew for sure
was that he'd deliver the summons
to the President informing him of

trial begins.

The Senate, in the impeachment
trial, has the supreme power to
compel the attendance of wit-
nesses, to enforce obedience to its
orders, mandates, writs, precepts,
and judgements, to preserve order,
and to punish in a summary way
contempts of. and disobedience to,
its authority, orders, mandates,
writs. precepts, or judgements,
and to make all lawful orders, rules
and regulations which it may deem
essential or conducive to the ends
of justice. according to the Senate
Manual.

The power of the Senate is so
absolute during an impeachment
trial, one close observer remarked,
that if the situation is grave
enough, the Senate has the power
to cite the President fot contempt

and lock him in a cell of the

 

    J U D I C I A R\*  

   

of their impeachment against him
for high crimes and misdemean-
ors.” .

Following Rodino’s report, the
Senate by order of Chief Justice
Warren Berger, who presides over
the Senate in cases of presidential
impeachments and who has the
authority to enforce writs and
orders. will send the Senate's
Sargent-at-Arms to the White
House to deliver personally a
summons to the President.
Complete with demands that he
dutifully answer the articles of
impeachment at a time and place

designated by the Senate, the ‘write

dramatically ends, commanding
the President: “Hereof you are not
to fail."

Procedures of the-Senate during
impeachment are clear and explicit
leading many observers to believe
the Senate will need only one
month after a positive vote in the
House to prepare for a trials. From
minor rules prescribing oaths to be
given senators hearing an im-
peachment trial to the important
directive providing that the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court,
preside over the trial. procedures
outlined in the Senate Manual

the trial and commanding him to

appear.

“But as far as impeachment
goes,” he concluded, “You know,
l’m prejudiced--l’m a Democrat.
The Democratsiappointed me to my
position.”

After Rodino’s report the the
Senate and Wannall's subsequent
visit to the ‘White House, the
Senate will begin the next day at 1
pm to consider the articles’ of
impeachment. And according to
the Senate Manual, the Chief
Justice will immediately appoint,

by order of the Senate, 12 Senators

to receive ‘evidence and ‘ take
testimony. The Committee will
afterwards report in writing their
findings to the whole Senate.

Meanwhile, unless the President
is already so directed by the
summons that he has a month to
prepare for a trial. it is likely that
his counsel will ask for at least 30
days or more.

Then at 12:30 in the afternoon of
the day appointed for the im-
peachment trial, President Nixon,
or more likely his chief defense
counsel James D. St. Clair, will
appear before the Senate to answer
the articles of impeachment. The

Capitol s basement jail for the
duration of the trial.

Conduct on the Senate floor is
alsoprescribed precisely, an
argument used by those in
opposition of the theory that a
televised Senate, trial will be
tantamount to a circus.

While counsel to the parties, in
this case St. Clair representing the

President and John Doar, counsel
for the Judiciary Committee, will
be admitted to the floor, all motions
made by them, or the parties they
represent, must be addressed to
the Chief Justice, or if they, or any
Senator wishes it, the motions must
be committed to writing and read at
the Secretary's table.

Witnesses will be examined by
one person only on behalf of the
party producing them, and then
cross-examined by one person on
the other side. If a Senator wishes
to address a question to a witness,
or to offer a motion or order, it
must also be reduced to writing and
read by the Chief Justice.

Senators will be allowed, 10

minutes of debate apiece on each"

article and 15 minutes at the
conclusions on the question of
impeachment.

The vote on that final question,
estimated to occur around Election
Day, two months after, the trials
beginning in September, and three
months after the vote in the House,
the yeas and nays will be taken
separately on each article of
impeachment.

As the House of Representatives
moves closer to becoming the
grand inquest for the nation, and
President Nixon moves closer to
being impeached by oral accusation
at the bar of the Senate by
Representative Peter Rodino, pro-
cedure for the final judgement also

is dramatically clear: only one of
the proposed odd-50 articles of
impeachment against the President
need be sustained by a two-thirds

 majority vote for the President to

be removed from office.

Party Leaders Seek  
Non-Partisan Image  

BY SHARON SEXTON

Partisanship has been very much
a part of the constitutional crisis in
which we now find ourselves
embroiled. Both parties have
politicked heavily in the practice of
and the protestation against
partisan politics. Democrats have
feigned a shocked modesty at
Watergate revelations while Re-
publicans have taken on a stance of
mournful martyrdom. At this
juncture in the Watergate story it
appears both parties have found
the most effective partisanship is
the appearance of non-partisan-
ship. ‘

Leaders of both parties are
fearful of the label “partisan.”
They hesitate to blast their
counterpart and when they feel it is
to their advantage to do so, they ‘do

A it subtly, modestly, in an advisory

tone.

George Bush, chairman of the
Republican National Committee, in
a speech last week charged the
Democratic members of Congress--
including Representative Jerome
R. Waldie of California and Robert
F. Drinan of Massachusetts, both
members of the House Judiciary
Committee--“have already made
up their minds that the President
must be driven from office."

"The Democratic leadership,"
Bush said at a fund-raising rally in
Chicago, “should try to influence
those in their own ranks to let the
system work. This is a critical time
for our country, and_’,we. pglitical
leaders must do what we canvto-see

 

. . (Continued on Page 9)

 

that the system is permitted to‘

work fully, fairly and without
excessive outside pressure.”

But Bush .was unwilling to push
such criticism very far. Before
ﬂying to Chicago he told a New
York Times reporter that with a few
exceptions, he thought the mem-
bers of the Judiciary Committee
had been ‘Tremarkably nonpartisan
and fair" in their impeachment
inquiry.

In his office in Washington,
Robert.Strauss, chairman of the
Democratic National Committee,
declined to comment on impeach-
ment. We've got a constitutional
problem here and we need a
constitutional response. The
innocent go free and the guilty are
punished. But it wouldn't serve
the nation or our party for us to
make a partisan issue out of
impeachment and that's the reason
i refuse to speak on that subject,
fall for it, as many Democrats think
maybe I should."

Strauss concurred with Bush that
most of the members of the
Judiciary Committee were weigh-
ing evidence not personalities and
political futures.

Just how partisan the issue has
become will be apparent in the
campaign for the November elec-
trons.

Strauss maintains the Demo-
cratic candidates will not run the
countryside chanting, “Watergate,
Watergate, Watergate elect me to
Congress." Although the Traxler.

investigation is trying to learn if the Pres-
ident committed tax frauds during his first
four years of office. A Senate committee
ruled last month that Nixon owed more
than $450,000 in back taxes. V

Centrally the staff is interested in the
possible back dating of the deed for Nix-
on’s gift of his vice presidential papers to
the National Archives.

The fourth area under concentration is
the ITT case. The investigators are trying
to learn whether the President was aware
of false testimony by former administra-
tion officials about the government settle-
ments with ITT. N

The fifth area concerns the Dairy Indus-
try fund. The inquiry is interested in know-
ing the magnitude of influence of campaign

contributors in the milk industry on the

governments subsequent policies favor-
able to the milk producers. Dairy cooper-
atives contributed nearly $500,000 to the
Nixon campaign.

The 'sixth~area'of investigation is the
Howard Hudges donation. In 1969 and 1970.
agents of Hughes gave $100,000 to Presi-
dent NiXon.’s best friend, Bebe Rebozo.
Rebozo returned_the money last year, tes-
tifying he did not tell the President of the
money until just before he returned it. But
Herbert Kalmbach has testified that Re
bozo told him he had lent money to Nixon’s
brothers, and personal secretary. Rose
Mary Woods.

The investigators hope to learn wheth-
er the money was lent to the Nixon asso-
ciates and if so. did Hughes receive any-
thing in return?"

The seventh and last area of considera-

tion is the Vesco contribution. This focuses_

on a $200,000 campaign contribution by
financier Robert Vesco, who is under in-
vestigation by the SEC. The question is

whether Vesco tried to buy influence with’
this large contribution. Since the acquittal ..

of Mitchell and Stans in the New York Ves-
co trial, this concern has been consider-
ably dimmed.

Yet another area of concentration could

still arise if the President continues to
plague the committee by refusing to com-

~"'Andrew Joh-nson intended to
.pursue a policy of charity for the
-, Southern states, but other govern-
' mental officials concerned for the
security of the country were intent
ontransforming Southern society.
The Republican Congress especi-
. ally wanted the enfranchisement of
black Southerners who had been
loyal tolthe Union so they could
“detect their _new freedom.
Meanwhile the former rebels
became the strongest political
forces in the Southern governments
established by Johnson.’

"To protect the loyalists, Con-
gress, enacted the Freedmcn’s
5Bur_eau and the Civil Rights Bills,
both of‘ which were then passed
over Presidential vetoes. - The
Fourteenth Amendment to the
Constitution was enacted to «prohi-
gbit states from denying citizens
fundamental rights of life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.
Intent on restoring the Union by
conciliating white Southerners,
Johnson was openlyhostile to the
Congressional program of Recon-
struction.’ The Congressional
program was in ruins because the
President refused to enforce its
-_ provisions.

 ' By May of 1866 Johnson’s
i‘ attempts to conciliate the South by
. ignoring Congressional enactments
. had. made many Republicans
' fearful of a coup d’etat by the
L President. .
 Republicans thought Johnson
had succeeded in converting a
conquered people, who were bitter
,but willing to accept the conse-
quences of defeat, into a hostile
aggressive and uncooperative
group. ..

_ Political and economic power had
been restored to Southern rebels
 and as such they were in positions
"to dominate men and women who
j "until recently had been slaves and
loyal to the Union. Instead of
L promoting Southern cooperation
with Reconstruction, Johnson's
. rejection of Congressional_Recon-
 struction insured that Southerners
‘would resist Reconstruction.

.: The Republican Congress
‘-.passed the Reconstruction Act of
.f 1867 in an attempt .to restore
t Southern states to the Union in a
"way acceptable to Congress.
‘According to the bill, the Southern
States had to ratify the 14th
Amendment and extend suffrage to
~bl_acks. Until they agreed, the

cially blacks, were to be protected
by the US Army, but the Congress
was unwilling to provide a
mechanism to enforce the law.
By following his own policies of
Reconstruction, Congressmen
thought Johnson had usurped their
authority. It was the job of the
President to enforce laws enacted
by Congress. They considered the
creation of such a mechanism to be
a usurpation of his authority.
" Johnson continued his mild
.reconstruction program and did not
enforce the Reconstruction Act,
which further intensified Southern
belligerance to restoration. By the
spring of 1867 some Republicans
thought a new Reconstruction’
program could not succeed unless
Johnson was removed from office,
and the House Judiciary Commit-
tee began studying the question of
impeachment.

stated he considered armed resis-
tance to Congress but rejected it in
the case of the Reconstruction Act
not because it was illegal or
unconstitutional but because the
act did not justify such a course of
action. A

Because of Johnson's interfer-
ence with the military, committee
member John C. Churchill of New
York reversed his nay vote and the
impeachment of the President was
recommended to the House of
Representatives.

Massachusetts presented the ma-
jority report, ‘an’ inflammatory
indictment of the President. It
charged the President had taken
upon himself the responsibility of
reconstructing the southern states.
He had ,vetoed ‘all the ‘Congress’
Reconstruction Acts and urged
Southerners to reject ‘the 14th
Amendment.

peached by the House.

newspapers of the time, reported President appointed men who

Johnson continued to fail “to returned tne former rebels to

execute the laws in their spirit-as
"well as in their letter...the.
President may, after all, come to be
regarded as an obstacle which must
be deposed."

By denying military con1mande1‘s
the authority required to enforce
Congress's plan Johnson indicated

he would continue to oppose the.

wishes of the Congress.

Another Reconstruction Act,
which restored the authority of
military commanders to guarantee
the rights of the Southern loyalists,

was passed by Congress.

The Judiciary Committee had
kept its proceeding strictly’confi-
dential and nobody expected the
committee to report impeachment
to the House. But. the tone of the
President's speeches influenced
many Republicans to prepare for
impeachment. _

In his annual message Johnson
said blacks were unable to govern
themselves because they were
“corrupt in principle and enemies

'_of free i_nstitut_ion_s." He ‘also

governments despite Congress's
disapproval.

When Boutwhell finished, Iowan
Republican James Wilson, chair-
man of the Judiciary Committee,
presented the minority report and
moved the inpeachment resolution
be laid on the table since the
President.had not committed any
indictable crime.

An impeachment vote was taken

‘and the House voted 108 to 57
against impeachment leaving the .

majority Republican party frag-
mented. Shortly. Johnson would
succeed in reuniting the party
against him.

The President publicly admitted
he wanted to organize a new
political party around himself and
his policy by controlling the civil
service "of the nation’. To prevent

this Congress passed the Tenure of ,

Office Act. . -

the removal of all civil-service
employees before the naming of
replacements by the President
when it was in session. If Congress
was in recess the President could
appoint an ad interim replacement
until Congress returned to session.

Within the President’s cabinet,
Secretary of War Edwin Stanton
opposed. Johnson's reconstruction
policies. He was ‘removed when
Congress was not- in session and
Ulysses S. Grant, General of the US
Army, .was appointed ad interim.
When the Senate returned to
session they refused to accept
Stanton's removal and Grant
relinquished the office of Stanton
against Johnsonis wishes.

But Johnson was determined to
remove Stanton by force if
necessary and the President
attempted to create a new
department of the army he could
depend on if the Senate refused to

, accept anew Secretary of War.

Johnson appointed General Lo-
renzo Thomas while Congress was
in session as Secretary of War, but»
Stanton refused ' to vacate the
office. The Senate met in executive

session for seven hours and drafted 1

a statement reading, “We do not
concure, in the action of the
President so to act, under the
existing laws without the consent of
the Senate.”

In December the House had
failed to impeach the President

I because Johnson had not violated a «

speciﬁc ‘law, but the Senate, where
a trial would be held, had
determined now that Johnson had.
violated a law.

In addition to Stanton the
President removed two military
commanders‘, Philip H. Sheridan
and Daniel E. Sickles because they
continued to enforce the R600”
struction Acts. Johnson‘ main-
tained they were under

Chief, and he had not issued any

orders to enforce the Reconstruc- P

tion laws passed by Congress.
Before the House had impeached
him then, Johnson had removed
every military commander in tlie
South intent on enforcing the
Reconstruction Acts. He had

relaced Stanton twice, and'quar- V
reled with Grant. He had begun to.

create a new military headquarters
in Washington to he commanded_
by. a more friendly general equal in
rank to the General of the Army,
U.S. Grant.

The impeachment issue in the
House was transferred from the
Judiciary Committee to the Recon-
struction Committee. On February
22, one day after the Senate’s
denunciation of the Thomas ap-
pointment, the House Committee
reported an impeachment resolu-
tion to the House of Representa-

tives based on Johnson's order to.

remove Stanton while Congress
was in session. ‘ -

The report said the President
was in total defiance of Congress
and the House voted overwhelm-

« ingly on February 24 to impeach
the President. All the Republicans
voted in the afﬁrmative and
another committee was appointed
to write specific articles of

impeachment. It finished its t-ask
five days later-.
Meanwhile. a committee was

established in the Senate to fashion
rules of procedure for an impeach-
ment trial. The Republicans

"wanted a speedy trial. . but the.
~ Democrats attempted to stall in the .

' l'll3.l’lIl6I‘,

his_
supervision as Commander-in-

Senate with the help of the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court,
Salmon P. Chase, who not only
opposed impeachment, but was
hoping to secure the Democratic
nomination for President in 1868.

The Senate summoned the
President t0.answer the House's
charges on March 13. A ten day
delay was granted‘ after the
President's counsel asked for a 40
day delay. On March 23 when
Johnson's lawyers answered the
charges. they asked for a 30 day

_ delay of the trial.

The House adopted a short reply
to the President’s answers and
presented it to the Senate the next
day. The Senate granted a one
week delay and the trial was
scheduled to begin March 30. By
that time, a month and a half had
elapsed since Stanton’s removal.

Senator Charles Sumner of
Massachusetts had hoped the ,trial
would last only ten days. Because
of debates -over procedural ques-
tions five weeks of the trial had
elapsed and still no testimony had
been taken.’ ' ' .

But, James A. Garﬁeld, conser- '

vative Republican representative
from Ohio observed, “This trial has
developed, in the most remarkable
the insane love’of
speaking among public men...
(who) if the alternative of convic-
tion of the President’, coupled with
their silence; and an unlimited
opportunity to talk, coupled with
his certain acquittal, were before
them would instantly decide to
speakf’

Four major issues were involved
in 11 articles of. impeachment
drafted by the House. The
President was charged with viola-

‘ ting the Tenure of Office Act by_

issuing orders to replace Stanton
and appoint Lorenzo Thomas ad
interim after the Senate had
refused to consent «to Stanton’s
removal.

Secondly, even if the Tenure of
Office Act was not applicable in
this case, as opponents of
impeachment argue, the President
had no authority to issue orders to
remove an officer and name_ a
replacement while the Senate was
in session.

Seven other articles charged the
President with conspiracy to violate
the law by force, threat, and
intimidation in relation to the first
two articles. ‘

The tenth article charged that
Johnson had attempted to bring
Congress into ridicule and disre-
pute because of his speeches
throughout the nation denouncing.
Congress. .

And finally, the eleventh article
charged the President with devi-
sing means to prevent the
execution of the ‘Reconstruction

laws. and the law requiringthe.

issuance of all military orders
through the General of the Army as
well as the Tenue of Office Act.

Many Republicans thought con-
viction on this article was most
likely if the President were to be
removed from office.

The President's lawyers argued
the Tenure of Office Act was
unconstitutional and therefore in-
valid. The House Managers of the

impeachment articles, who pre- 

sented the House's case against
Johnson disagreed with this theory
because the Senate had rendered
its decision that the bill was
constitutional by passing it over the
President's veto. ‘

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

If I.F. Stone’s characterization of
a small boy covering a hell of a big
ﬁre ever‘ applied to anyone»
“You’re a cub reporter,” Stone
says, “and God has just given you
And you
forget--that it's really burning?--it
applies to James M. Naughton of

- .. the New York Times.

A reporter with solid exper-

 ience--covering the Stokes’ admin-

istration for the Cleveland Plain

-. Dealer, and then the White House
,' and the Capitol for the New Yorlr
~. Times, Naughton is presently in

the midst of coveringthe impeach.-

ﬁrnent process, or as he calls it,

writing history. .
.“I used to joke around the

' office,” Naughton remarked, “that
the one story I really wanted to

cover was the impeachment of the’
President. And now that I’m doing
it, it scares the hell out of me.”

Short and thin, rusty hair and "

small blue eyes, Naughton’s
scrambled appearance after a
rigorous Times deadline reflects
the seriousness and “meticulous-
ness" he puts into each story. He
types out each story in awe and in
the tradition of the New York
Times.
“And all that is magnified. in
impeachment," Naughton said,
‘explaining the pressures of the job.
“Because here you're dealing with
the President, his future, and the
presidency itself. ‘So you don't

want to jump to conclusions and
write half-baked stories."

Naughton admits that he once
had a self-conﬁdence problem.
especially when he covered the
campaign of
Edmund Muskie. But now. as he
unwinds daily from covering the
impeachment inquiry on Capitol
Hill Naughton dismisses problems
of conﬁdence and readily im-
presses an interviewer of his
self-assurance. ’

On a typical day, Naughton could
be seen on Capitol Hill, either
clinging near the quarters of the
House Judiciary Committee in the
Rayburn Building, or dropping
bythe Speakers Lobby to interview

' members as they come off the floor

of the House. Once the
proceedings are over, Naughton

‘heads back _to.the Times plush

bureau in downtown Washington to
-write up. the story for the day, or

 feed his information to a colleague.

“My wife could probably tell you

that I spend a lot of time thinking

about impeachment, to the distress
of my children," said ‘Naughton.

the Capitol‘ at 10 am, does not get 

home until nearly midnight. “And

worrying about impeachment, a-
bout being fair, accurate, trying to
look for the next alley to pursue.”

Two of the problems Naughton
has had to contend with in covering
the impeachment inquiry are
getting to know the Judiciary
Committee members and re-
searching the subject of impeach;
ment. The bookshelf of his
newsroom desk is cluttered, amid
the red packages of pall malls, with
documents. and sources of im-
peachment, the Judiciary Com-

appropriate."

Naughton, while hoping that his
personal beliefs remained inde-
pendent of his news stories written
for the Times, said he does not
mean to suggest he does not have

thoughts on the process of~

impeachment. ., _

‘‘I think anything I write is going
to be colored by my background,
my attitude, my philosophy of
government, politics, law. But I

mittee-’s documents, various man-
uals on Watergate, and a book or
two on the Johnson impeachment
trial. /

“You’ve got to read through
these,” Naughton said of the
books, “and try tounderstand the

‘background of impeachment--the
historic magnitude of it, what the
process really involves. Because
‘the process hasn’t occured for so

long, nobody knows that much:

about it - I

 

Most members of the House
Judiciary Committee recognize
Naughton. but he-modestly claims
it is mostly because he works for
the Times.

Naughton explains he has had
some recognition problems of his
own. “When this thing all
started." Naughton explains, “We
used to sit up in the House gallery
and see members going out on the,
floor talking about impeachment.
And we'd have to nudge one
another and say ‘Who's that?
Nobody knew the members of the
House. You knew the members of
the Senate because there are so

Although he has become ac-
quaintenance and friend to many
committee members, Naughton
holds a strictrule that he not "play
around," with those individuals he
writes about. For example he
explains one. committee member
had asked him

book about the impeachment

process when it was over and‘

can.

As a close observer to the
impeachment inquiry, Naughton
senses that the chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, is not really
comfortable in his role. “He didn't
seek it,” Naughton explained, “He
was so overwrought for a wliilethat
the doctor put him in the hospital to
get some rest.
resigned to the responsibility, but
he didn't really seek it.”

Naughton noted that the Com-
mittee, under - Rodino's chairman-
ship, has remained relatively
bipartisan and has also been able to
leaks, until
recently. And although he feels
news leaks could seriously malign

if the impeachment inquiry because

the White House could utilize them
as part of the political atmosphere,
Naughton says he spends a great

V deal of time looking forpleaks, and

is willing . to print them when
received. V
“I have a problem with grand’

- jury testimony," Naughton A con- »

fessed. “I would have a great
problem doing that [printing grand
jury testimony.] Heretyou are ina
purely legal atmosphere. But

-impeachment is .a political process

in the broadest sense. It is not
double jeopardy even if the
President is removed from office

v through impeachment. He is still
' subject to the criminal process.”

Naughton scoffs H at those ‘who
predict a televised Senate trial will
be tantamount to a circus, deﬁning-
impeachment as "a very technical,
involved, legalistic effort." ' l

‘'1 think the more exposure‘

people have to impeachment, the

« more likely it is they will accept it

and the more likely’ it isto be fair
" said Naughton,
basing histhought on. the Senate
Watergate hearings televised last
summer. , .

Two factors are expected to

weigh heavily in the anticipated‘

vote on impeachment in. the
House. and possibly the trial in the"
Senate. according-to, Naughton.
The first is. the November election,
which, Naughton says, “plays into
it the way‘ the Constitution's
framers intended it to."

“They must go back and
rationalize .*(their vpte) to‘ their
constituents ‘and ithatls a very .big
element in this process." ' '

_ the incident.

BY TOM SMITH

Impeachment proceedings have
begun in the House of Representa-
tives 105 years after the impeach-
ment and trial of Andrew Johnson.
In a few months Richard M. Nixon
may become the second President
in the history of the nation to be
impeached for high crimes and
misdemeanors.

Though impeachment has been a
direct result of the revelations of
White House involvement in
Watergate, tales of impeachment
have been circulating since the
Cambodian invasion and the

shooting of demonstrators at Kent '

State and Jackson State.’

The Scranton Commission "which
studied the disorders said the
inﬂammatory tone of the Presi-
dent’s speeches as well as other
members of his administration,
referring to college students as
bums and brownshirts, led up" to
the attacks on college students.

A similar incident preceded the
Johnson" impeachment. The
President, while touring the nation,
chastized Congress for attempting
to include blacks in Southern
governments. After the ‘tour a
peaceful convention in New
Orleans was attacked by New
Orleans police and resulted in
nearly 200 deaths, mostly blacks.

A congressional committee, the
Select Committee on New Orleans
Riots, investigating the massacre
held the President responsible for
It concluded, “The
effect of the action 'of_t,he President
was to encourage the heart, to
strengthen the hand, and to hold
up the arms of those men...(partic-
ipating) in a massacre so inhuman
and ﬁendlike, as that which took
place at New Orleans on the 30th of
July."

After the role of.the Justice

Department in the Watergate
incident was revealed the President
cooperated in setting up the Special
Prosecutor's ‘office. Nixon ﬁred
Cox on October 20 and a storm of
protest struck the Congress.

Congressmen emotionally called’

for the impeachment. of the
President. ‘

‘ The firing of Edwin Stanton, the

Secretary of War, unleashed
similar forces in Congress in _1868.
The Senate claimed the President
was in violation of the law, and,
subsequently, the House of Repre-
sentatives voted‘ to impeach the
President. . ‘ V V

The power and‘ authority of
government since the Presidency of
Franklin D. Roosevelt, has been
centralized in the executive branch.

It has been labeled the modern
presidencyf _President Nixon has
used that power to wage war and
impound funds appropriated by
Congress.

Throughout his terms of office
Nixon has been in a state of
continual confrontation with the
Congress, whose members gclaim
Nixon has stripped them of their
authority.

With the great power resting in
the executive branch members of
the Nixon administration became
involved in many illegal activities. »
Once caught they were determined
to use-the machinery of govern-
ment, which they controlled, for
their protection. -

John Dean alleges the President,
himself, -was involved in such a
cover up. Impeachment seems
likely because, of the President’s
criminal conduct related to Water-
gate. In short then, Nixon will be

‘impeached because of an abuse of

power made -possible by the
existence of a Presidency with
broad powers.

Michael Les Benedict, author of
The Impeachment and Trial of
Andrew Johnson, maintains John-
son was a modern president in the
sense of claiming jurisdiction over
matters irrespective of Congress’s

wishes. Benedict writes, ‘‘In many ..

ways'Johnson was a very modern
president, holding a view of
presidential authority’ that has only
recently been established."
Johnson, too, was in.constant

' conflict with the Congress. He was

impeached because he abused his

power by overturning congression-

al reconstruction legislation.
Many Americans still oppose

removing the President from office. .

They maintain respect for - the
Presidency will be destroyed and
the structure of government will be
irreparably altered if Nixon is
impeached and convicted.

An article in the New York Times
May 19 stated the impeachment of
the President was being fought by

‘ months after

grass root forces. A man from New
Jersey is quoted as saying.
“Americans certainly should come
to realize that more than the man

Richard M. Nixon is at stake. The if

on the ledge."

The same sentiment was, ex-'.

William P. Fessenden, a Repub-

‘Problems, by Raoul Berger, Har-
ard University Press, Cambridge,
Mass. I973

-:;This. the second volume in the
tudies in Legal History published

.-Zexcerpts from it appearing in the
‘new publication by the House
Judiciary Committee. have been or
will be read by nearly every

_C§ngressman and Senator.

’ The suddenly sexy subject is, of
hoarse. the impeachment of a

President. Professor Berger is the
I ight man. and this is the right
ook_at the right time.

Berger, as the Charles Warren
Senior Fellow in American Legal
“ History at the Harvard Law School,
is no Johnny-Come-Lately, nor is
his book a popularized “Every-
. hing You Wanted To Know About
--7Impeachment If You Had Wit
{Enough to Ask the Right Ques-
.-'tions."’
 Berger's ﬁeld may be described
5 roughly as the separation of powers
Land 'his previous works have

already established him as the
il’ea~ding expert. In 1969 his book
“Congress v. the‘Supreme Court"
. _confirmed his reputation for

‘ship’. 13 1965 he published the
- deﬁnitive article on (the non-exis-
 tence of) executive privilege.

a Tie does not pick a subject
* because it is fashionable. nor
because through some ulterior
motive he has an a priori point to
vindicate. This book appeared in

advance of any serious consid-
eration of the impeachment of Mr.
Nixon. . .
There is, however. frequent
reference to Mr. Ford's attempt to

impeach Justice William
0. Douglas in 1970 and his
assertion that an impeachable

offense is whatever the House with
‘ the concurrence of the Senate says
. It is. I ‘
Two points should be made
 about the book. the first of which
should by now be obvious. If
 Berger says it, it probably is so.

~ rigorous and independent scholar--

l973 so it was undertaken well in.

His research. as usual, is complete
and careful. But in addition to
writing with precision. he writes
with clarity and with style. Noone
should be put off reading it because
there are footnotes (which are good
reading in themselves). The pages
have a vibrancy independent of
current interest in the subject
matter.

I haven't read St.Clair's brief on
behalf of Mr. Nixon arguing that an
impeachable offensive must be an
indictable offense. so I don't know
what he relied on. Even assuming
Berger was making an argument
from a partisan position, as St.
Clair is, ldon't know what St.Clair
could have relied on. Berger is
utterly convincing that Mr. Ford
was probably “righter" than he
knew.

The signiﬁcance of this book is

that since power to define the

the first
the

offenses at least in
instance lies in Congress,

debate will focus on whether they.

ought to limit the particulars in a
bill of impeachment to indictable
offenses, rather than whether they
have to.

Berger takes us from the English
practices, through the Constitutinal
Convention, into what has actually
been done in this country by
previous congresses in impeach-
ment proceedings.

Impeachment was the device
whereby Parliament made the
ministers of the king responsible to
it rather than to the crown. In large
part this was done through the
Parliamentary power to declare
retrospective treasons. Since they
could not strike at the crowned
head of the state, they would go
after the heads of the
hands." Ministers responsible for
administering unpopular policies

which struck at basic liberties were I

tive trials.
speciﬁcally deﬁned. Speciﬁcally
deﬁned treasons were handled in
the courts rather than in Parlia-

conviction on impeachment to only
loss of office rather than loss of
head.

High crimes and misdemeanors
as a definition of impeachable
offenses came into use in England
before misdemeanors became cri-
minal offenses. The impeachments
brought under that rubric again
show that the English practice was
not to limit impeachment to
indictable offenses.

_ The impeachment debate in the
constitutional convention was al-
most exclusively concerned with
the President. And the records
show the preoccupation was with
greed for power, hardly an
indictable offense. On the other
hand, too much power in the
legislative branch was a concern.
Maladministration as an impeach-
able offense was rejected as an
invitation to the destruction of the
independence of the executive.

The American experience in

-impeachments conﬁrms that the

definition is broader than indict-
able offenses. In the ﬁrst
successful inpeachment Judge
Pickering was removed. He was
insane. Insane persons cannot be
convicted of crime.‘ Are they not to
be removed from ofﬁce? The most
recent successful impeachment (in
1936) was Judge Ritter. There were
7 counts. the ﬁrst 6 alleged
criminal acts‘ of which he was
acquitted. The 7th, that by virtue’
of the foregoing 6 he brought
disrepute on his ofﬁce, is the one
he was convicted on.

There are commonsense argu-
ments that impeachment is not
limited to indictable offenses which
Professor Berger does not have to
resort to. For instance - indictable
under whose laws? Things
criminal in one state are not in
another. Killing a President was

not a federal crime until after.

Kennedy was assasinated. What
about‘ things done outside _ the
United States? ‘

One of Berger’s concerns which
has been generally ignored in
evaluations of this book is that
there are limits on what are
impeachable offenses, although
indictable offenses is not one of
them. Plainly no limits risks
legislative supremacy. ‘While one
might posit that since Judge
Ritter’s impeachment there has
been perhaps undue deference by
the Congress to the President and
no suggestion of the likelihood of
anything approaching the grab for

power by the Congress the
imneachment of President Johnson
manifested. As a matter of theory,
the concern remains a legitimate
one. Is self restraint a sufficient
limit on the impeachment power?

Here V Berger" makes a
suggestion, and it is no morethan
that, which causes me some

difficulty. In what I assume is a

reation to Mr. Ford’s efforts of
1970, Professor Berger argues for
judicial review of _ impeachment
proceedings._ He reviews that
arguments against it and them
makes some for it. Here he does
not rely on history, nor the text of
the Constitution, but rather what
he conceives to be good policy.
While I share, as a matter of theory
his concerns that lead him to want
some sort of review, his cure could
be worse than the disease.

He begins with the notion that
Congress should not be the judge
of its own powers as axiomatic. If

limitations on the powersof the
Congress, then I see a role for the
Supreme Court in deciding for
itself and not accepting what

_Where the concern is that
Congress (chosen in a way that the
Supreme Court is not) has too
broadly deﬁned impeachable of-

going beyond age, citizenship and

Those standards are clear and ﬁt
for a court to administer.

But Professor Berger has already

convincingly demonstrated that the

' standard for impeachable offenses

is not a clear line like indictable
offenses. What standard should
the Court [appointed by the
President] use in reviewing whe-

would not, and should not win the
candidates the election.

Democratic‘candidates, accord-
ing to Strauss, are being counseled
by party leaders to focus on
“Republican failures" in general;
to talk about the Nixon administra-
tion not in terms of Watergate but
“the cost of bacon, talk about it in
terms of the lines at the gas station,
talk about it in terms of the veto of
minimum wage, impoundment,
health care..."

Strauss concedes if “we do the
right things, we'll have a big
victory. The right things mean you
pick good candidates, get on the
right side of the issues, get
ﬁnanced decently and properly and
articulate those issues well and
then we'll do well. If they don't,
they gonna get beat...And this is
the campaign theme we're trying to
set up here." ‘

Bush has conceded he is ‘more
concerned than ever" about the
political ramifications of Water-

Times interview he now believes--
as he did not until recently--Water-

According to the same article the
party leader said he found his job

had become fatalistic, “because to
a large extent things are beyond

he might try to focus attention on’

said, Watergate will inevitably

But, even in Berger’s view, the  .:
role of the Court would not be to " "

determine whether the evidence

not, but whether in the abstract the

A Story oflmpeachm

(Continued from Page I)

The second defense of the
President was Johnson had not in
fact removed Stanton, but had only
attempted to remove the Secretary
of War. This argument incensed
the seven Republican House
Managers. Thaddeus Stevens of
Pennsylvania. Benjamin F. Butler.
of Massachusetts, John A.
Bingham of Ohio. George S.
Boutwell of Massachusetts. James
F. Wilson _ of Iowa, Thomas
Williams of Pennsylvania. and
John A. Logan of Illinois.

They argued the President
should not be allowed to remain in

' office after attempting to commit a

crime merely because he had not
succeeded. Their question: the
fact» that a man in such — a
responsible and powerful position
attempted to violate the law reason
to fear for the safety of the nation‘?

A provision of the Tenure of
Office Act held that department
heads should hold office during the
term of the President who
appointed them and one month
after, unless removed with the
advice and consent of the Senate.
The Pre§ident’s lawyers used this
provision to maintain that Stanton
was not covered by the-Tenure of
Office Act.

Johnson's opponents maintained
Stanton was covered until April 4‘,
1869, which would have been the
end of Lincoln's second term. They
argued Johnson had no term of
office. Furthermore, the House
claimed Johnson had acknow-
ledged the law protected Stanton

The next line of defense

maintained Johnson's only crime
was to have made a mistake even if
the President's interpretations of
the laws were wrong and Stanton
was protected by the Tenure of
Office Act.
Johnson's lawyers argued the
President had a right, independent
of Congress or the Supreme Court,
to decide the constitutionality of
laws. since it was the President's
sworn duty to uphold the Constitu-
tion. They said the President could
violate or refuse to enforce a law he
believed to be unconstitutional
without intending to commit a
crime.

Boutwell, the House spokesman,
disagreed by saying, “For the
purpose of government, his [John-
son’s] will or opinion is substituted
for the actions of the law-making
power, and the government is no
longer a government of laws, but

But

the government of one man...His
offense is that he intentionally
violated a law. Knowing its terms
and requirements, he disregarded
them.”

The President's ﬁnal line of
defense was that he had intended
only to test the constitutionality of
the Tenure of Office Act.

However, the opposition main-
tained Johnson never had indicated
any intention to challenge the law
in the courts until the Senate
refused to approve Stanton's
removal.

Johnson had suspended Stanton
and as the law required he had
appointed’ his successor Secretary
of War ad interim indicating the
President did not consider his
removal of Stanton ﬁnal without
Congressional assent. Johnson
had sent the reasons for Stanton"s

suspension to the Senate as
dictated by law. The House
Managers asked how Johnson

could now insist he had always
intended to challenge the constitu-
tionality of the Tenure of Office
Act. ,

The trial lasted nearly three
months, but many Senators were
concerned with more than simply
the guilt or innocence of Andrew
Johnson.

If Johnson were forced out of
office, the President Pro Tem of the
Senate, Benjamin F. Wade of Ohio
would assume the Presidency.
Because of his economic policies
and his connections with the
soft-money, high tariff Iron and

Steel Association, many senators"

were fearful of a Wade administra-
tion. The nation was suffering
from serious inﬂation and a need
for fiscal reform, consisting of
measures diametrically opposed" to
the positions held by Wade.

When Iron Age, the organ of the
industry. called for a meeting of
high tariff men to take advantage of
a prospective Wade administration
to pass a new tariff bill the Chicago
Tribune wrote, “They are doing
more to defeat the impeachment of
Johnson than any other equal
number of men in the country, and
far more than the President’s
counsel."

Many conservative Republicans
were willing to vote" against
conviction if they were certain
Johnson did not intend to retaliate
against Republicans and interfere
with Reconstruction if he were
judged not guilty. They suggested

1 .......~....I=|T1' NEWS  

that the President name John
Schofield. a military commander,
to the office of Secretary of War.
Johnson did this on April 24.

On-May 4 Republican Senator
Edmund G. Ross of Kansas, whose
vote would acquit the President in
another two weeks, informe'd
Johnson he hoped the President
would demonstrate his good
intentions by forwarding to the
Senate the new constitutions of
Arkansas and South Carolina
adopted under the Reconstruction

laws. Johnson did so the next’ day.

As impeachment progress John-
son stopped interfering with
Congressional Reconstruction poli-
cies. The Chicago Tribune wrote,
“Andrew Johnson has been a
changedman. The country has
been at peace. The great
obstruction to the law has been
‘virtually suspended; the Presi-
dent..has been on his good
behavior}:

By the time Senators voted on
impeachment only Virginia, Miss-
issippi, and Texas were unrestored
and subject to Presidential interfe-
rence.

Some Republicans realized im-
peachment already had achieved
its purpose. It was inevitable the
President would be acquitted on at
least ten of the 11 articles.

William P. Fessenden, Republi-
can Senator of Maine, who would
be another of the seven Republi-
cans voting against impeachment
on Article XI, was convinced
Johnson's removal “would shake
the faith of the friends of
constitutional liberty in the perma-
nency of our free institutions and
the capacity of man for self-govem
ment.” ».

May 16 was the date set for the
impeachment vote. The Senate
failed to convict the President on
Article XI with seven. Republican
senators joining the Johnson
supporters in voting against
impeachment. The other articles
had no chance of being accepted in
the Seante, so defeat of Article XI
meant defeat of‘ impeachment in
Congress.

iOne of the greatest trials in’
American history had come to a
conclusion.
