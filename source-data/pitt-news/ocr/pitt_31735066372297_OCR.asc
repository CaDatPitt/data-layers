Board of Trustees Meet C

WPIC Takes Over Guidance Center

By SETH LU BOVE

Western Psychiatric lnstitute and
Clinic (WPIC) will take over the
-Pittsburgh Child Guidance Center's
teaching. research and service func-
tions by January l982. Pitt’s board

of trustees decidedat their annual

fall meeting yesterday.

in addition. WPlC willihave first
choice in renting any spacethe guid-
ance center decides to lease out. If
WPlC decides it wouldn’t need the
space. Pitt will have final approval
on other possible tenants.

“The proposal would seem to be
beneficial to WPlC and Pitt." said
Dr. Nathan Stark. senior vice chan-
cellor for the health sciences. in
announcing the resolution.

The transfer of services to WPlC
resulted from “unnecessarily cum-
bersome" management of child psy-
chiatric services through the
guidance center. difficulty in “legally
achieving full integration" with
WPlC programs. and insufficent or
unsure sources offunding for outpa-
tient care. according to a report
from the trustees’ Health Sciences
Committee. —

in l955. the guidance center. a
non-profit corporation, constructed
a four-story building with its own
funds on Pitt-owned property on
DeSoto Street. The.land was leased
to the guidance center at no cost.
although Pitt kept the title to the
property.

Students jammed C.J. Barney's and other bars Wednesday night as part .
ot Homecoming Bar Night sponsored by the Pitt -Program Council. IL

Pitt also kept the option to pur-
chase the building. minus the depre-
ciation. or provide equivalent space
on another site. In .1963. the guid-
ance center added" two floors to the
building. and later went on to build
another seven floors.

ln I978. an “Affiliation Council”
was formed comprised of members
appointed by Pitt's board oftrustees
and the guidance center’s trustees.
The council was responsible for
making recommendations on the
planning and budgetary aspects of
the two institutions’ child psychia-
tric programs.

But the attempt to cut across insti-
tutional lines of management was

apparently unsuccessul. leading to

Schenley Bid Processﬁpens  

By FREDERICK BEERS

After a seven week delay. the
opening round of bids was taken
yesterday for the renovation of
Schenley Hall.

’The university‘s oversight of a.
l9l3 construction law caused the
delay, which may cost Pitt between
$3.000 and $5.000. according to
Andy Smith. Director of Student
Affairs.

Yesterdays bids came from four
types of subcontractors: heating.
ventilation. and air conditioning;
plumbing; fire protection; and elec-
trical. according to Wally Jobusch.
Director of Plant Services and
Building Management. Bids from
general contractors will be taken
next Thursday.

The subcontractors bids will be

66'

reviewed. Jobusch said. and if
everything is in order. we will
announce the low bidders. probably
next Monday."

Ten bids were taken from heating.
ventilation, and air conditioning
contractors. Jobusch said, and they
ranged "from $l.653.000 to
$2.06|.448. Eleven plumbing con-
tractors’ bids ranged from $304,000
to s43o.400. while six fire protection
contractors gave bids ranging from
$277.000 to $589.000. Teri electrical
contractors’ bids ranged from
$l.293.000 to $2.l96.000.

Following next week's general
contractor bids. the university will
have 30 days to review the entire
package. lf everything is in order.
Pitt will enter into contracts with the
successful bidders~Jobusch said.

Five separate contracts will be

awarded. he said. but the general
contractor will be responsible for all
of the subcontractors.

lf the total bidding does not

exceed the $1 l.3 million ceiling set
by the university. contracts could be
signed immediately after the review-
ing period. Jobusch said. He added
that he doesn’t expect the review to
take the full 30 days.

Jobusch estimated the total cost
of the project to be in the neighbor-
hood of $l0-l0.5million.

Jobusch expects that actual con-

struction will begin in early
December and take about 22
months.

The Allegheny County Higher
Education Assitarice Authority.
which recently received state certifi-
cation. will finance the project
through the sale ofmunicipal bonds.

tees recommendation that WPlC

Overall. the trustees approved ﬁve
actions yesterday concerning the
guidance center and WPlC:

0 The transfer of the child psychi-
atric teaching. research and clinical
services from the guidance center to

; WPIC:

0 The termination of the existing
affiliation agreement between the
guidance center and Pitt. “although

SGB Member
Resigns From
Board Position 

By CHRIS CLINTON

Student Government Board
member Mark Stevens resigned’
from the board yesterday. because
of “other interests” in his academic
and career goals.

ln a hand written letter to board
president Bill Abraham. Stevens
said that his “interests call him to
New York and France and eventu-
ally away from the university
community."

Stevens said he plans to leave Pitt

at the end of the fall term and attend
The Culinary Arts lnstitute in New
York City for two years and then to
train in France for four years and
eventually pursue a career in the res-
taurant business. ‘
Stevens decided to resign, he said.
after ‘a discussion with Abraham
yesterday morning concerning.Ste-

vens’ lack ofattendance at SGB pub- _

lic meetings. Stevens has missed six
meetings since becoming aboard

' member. and the board’s constitu-

tion states that a board member may
miss only four before facing the pos-
sibility of removal from the_board.

Stevens said it was by “mutual

consent" between himself and Abra-
ham that he decided to resign from
his position. He said that his “inten-
tions were not to make any waves”
for the board.

lf Stevens had not resigned, the
board would have been forced to
hold hearings and remove him from
the board as the constitution
requires.

Abraham said after last week’s
meeting thatthe board set a prece-
dent with last term’s removal of
David Klaus due to lack of attend-
ance. and it might also remove
Stevens. I

After Klaus was removed from
the board. Colleen Clarke. was
appointed to finish out l(laus’term.

The Nuclear Arms
  Buildup

Part Two of a series

This. the second part of a con-
tinuing series on reactions to

-America's defense strategies

tinder the Reagan admt'm'stra-
tion, features commentary by
Dr. Johathan Harris, an expert
in U.S.-Soviet. relations, and a
professor of ‘ political science at
the Universit_v of Pittsburgh.

By scor stone

“The present administration
seems to have concluded that the
U.S.S.R. has designed its strategic
capabiltiy for a first strike against
the U.S. In Reagan’s discussion of
this so-called window of vulnerabil-
ity, it appears that the U.S.S.R actu-
ally envisions such a policy.

“My view is that the Soviet stra-
tegic forces are designed for deter-
rent purposes. When you consider
the vastness of the country and the
number of foreign policy problems,

it seems clear that this is what they _

are doing.

“A nightmare forethe.Soviets is the
possibility that the U.S. is moving
towards a mutual defense agreement

_ with the People’s Republic of China.

Right now, that is probably the
greatest perceived threat for the

3

Political Science

University of Pittsburgh

Soviets. There are territorial claims
made by the Chinese against the
Russians, and the border area is

.. where the greatest concentration of

troops and missiles lie.

“This is something to consider,
too, in determining to what end the
Soviets are building their _forces. I
don‘t know if American defense
planners take this into considera-
tion, or if‘ they believe that every
missile in the U.S.S.R. could be
pointed towards the U.S. ,

“In view of these facts, it is very
important that we resume discussion
on arms control. There have already
been face to face discussions with the
Soviets, particularly the recent
meeting in Austria between Haig
and Gromyko. As far as I can tell,
the discussion has centered on
medium range weapons.

“As far as what the actual threat
posed by the Soviets, I believe that

there is a great deal of.misunder-
standing on our part. On the stra-
tegic level, there is almost nothrcat
of a first strike by the Soviets. It is

simply not a rational political “

response on their part. Both sides
are. in fact developing deterrent for-
ces, but they perceive one another as
attempting to achieve first strike
capability.
“As it stands, neither side is able
to believe the other’s reasoning.
I “Locally, the Soviets are not in
competition with the U.S. over
scarce resources. The U.S.S.R. has
massive quantities of oil and natural
gas. As far as I know, the Soviets
have never acted in a way as to indi-
cate a desire to move into the Per-
sian Gulf to obtain access to oil.
‘ “What makes Americans anxious
is when Russia supports its friends

around the world. Their support of

revolutionary movements and

Marxist governments is an expres-
sion of the Soviets socialist
ideology.

“If we were to take the time to
look at the facts, we would see that
in most cases, the soviet relations
with its allies is a drain on its resour-
ces. And, in the end, the Soviets are
often led along by the nose, so to
speak, by these so-called client
states.

“Take Ethiopia, for example. It is
practically a classic case. They want
Soviet aid primarily to fight the
Somalians. In the process they
mouth a kind of socialist ideology,

but, when it comes to forming an_

‘organized socialist, or communist
party, as the Soviets would like to
see, there appears to be no effort on
their part to reach this goal.
“Past American presidents have
‘implicitly considered the likelihood
of nuclear war. It was always pre-
sumed that any limited conflict
would take place in Europe in

response to a conventional assault '

by Warsaw Pact troops. What the
Reagan administration has been
saying this-past week simply makes
this view explicit. v

“The European reaction reminds
me,, a great deal, of the ban-th,e-

bomb movement there in the l950‘s, .

in response to Dulles’ strategy of

‘massive retaliation. When he said
that if the communists crossed any

one ofa number of imaginary lines,

we would, in effect, nuke’em, the

Europeans reacted strongly. The

situation there is much the same

today. I

why we continue to consider an
assault “on Western Europe, a
serious possibility. The Soviets are
faced with so’ many foreign policy
problems that an attack on Europe
is simply irrational. Besides, as Pro-
fessor Cottam has said over and over
again, the Soviets are not. as we see
them, Hilterian. They are not out to
conquer space. We are acting. too.
as if the Soviets are exactly the same
as in the period after World War II.
It is a different world today.

“Our response is ideologically
motivated, coupled with a kind of
fear that we are no longer number
one.

“What I find puzzling is not the
apparent irrationality of this pos-
ture, but rather its contradictory
nature. Publicly, we regard the
Soviets vituperatively, yet, at the
sametime, we lift the grain embargo
that was supposed to be a form of
punishment, and we engage in
negotiations.

“The Soviets are equally divided
in their leadership when it comes to
dealing with us, and when we send
them conflicting signals we exacer-
bate thc situation.

“The best thing we could do now
is to sit down with them and talk, a

start would be a follow-up by us on“
Breshncv‘s recent statement that the

Soviets would never use atomic wea-
pons except in the case of retaliation

to a first strike.

“This, I think would help diffuse
the anxiety that has bubbled up in
the last few years. We have the agen-
cies to engage in dialogue; it does not
make sense not to use them. '

The residents of Lothrop Hall are
dispr_oving the theory that-Bitt stu-
dents are_a'pathetic. and they are
urg‘ing'o_ther resident students to do
the same by participating in the i981
lL'othro‘p‘ Ctialienge. "'4

‘The lothrop Challenge. spon-
sored by th’e.Loth'rop Resident Stu-
'AssQciatio_n Hall Council is
fund-raising project-developed three
years ago by a Lothrop resident. It
has continued everyyear since then
to encourage good public relations
between the dorms, students and the
Pitt community‘: according to
Cheryl Johnson, Lothrop RSA Hall E
Council president. '

- All ofithe dorms were issued a
challenge two weeks ago by Lothrop
"residents tozselect a_,charity and to
attempt to raise the most money per
dorm resident for t-hat charity by the
end ofvthe term.

“So far, most of the dorms have
accepted the challenge this year."
Johnson said. ' 4

According to Steven Smith. Jan
Ujevich and Barry Radtke, execu-
tive members of the Lothrop RSA
Hall'Council, students can do any-
thing to raise money for their chari-
ties as long as it legal, moral and
doesn’t interfere with another
dorm‘s,_efforts.

Creative money-making ideas in
previous Lothrop Challenges have
included tuck-ins. in which students
may pay 25 cents to have another

“Instead of just taking money.
were trying to make it fun." John-

Alongrwith raising money for a
good cause. the Lothrop Challenge
also offers students the chance to
meet other residents in their dorms
by participating together in these
activities. ~
Lothrop has won the Challenge
for the past two- years and has -

Bicycle Thefts Evident
on Pitt’s Campus

By ROB «GARDNER

The evidence room of the campus
police department looks like a hard-
ware store. ln nearly every compa rt-
ment that is used to hold evidence
until trial. there is a pair of pliers.
W‘1rCCUtl€l"S Or. most commonly.
boltcutters. Their owners have been
caught trying to steal bicycles.

Since May. the university police
have arrested 25 people who were
observed possessing instruments of
crime in the vicinity ofbike racks or
who were actually in the process of
stealing a bicycle. This month alone.
six have been reported stolen.

Lt- Jim Watters of the campus
police cites two main reasons for
bike thefts on _campus. In most
cases. victims of bike theft lock their
bicycles in obscure areas where
thieves would have more time to act.
The second reason often given for
bike thefts is that bike-“owners pur-
chase inferior locks. Watters said it
doesn't make sense to lock it $250
bicycle with a $5 lock. When a bike
owner is looking for a lock, he

it should scrutinize the padlock as well

as its chain or cable.

Campus police recommend the
“Citadel“ lock: according to Wat-

Abraham said. however. that the
board would not appoint another
member.

“The minimum time it takes to
appoint somebody is about a
month." Abraham said. “It’s a
judgement call on our part. He said
by the tthie the appointment is
made. the term would almost be
over.

The board functioned with eight
members aliter Klaus‘ removal,
Abraham said and can do so again
until the end of the term.

Stevens said he was busy with his
transfer to cooking school and his
job but he/tried to keep his board
position.iHe said he still “has a great
interest in the board."

“l’m sorry it (the resignation) had
to come this late in the term," Ste-

vens said, “But I thought l could do

both things at the same time.“

Stevens said he is not happy with
college and his present major. com-
munications He said that his two
ycars at Pitt were good years and he
did not decide to leave because ofthe
university itself.

Abraham said Stevens’ decision
to resign showed  lot of maturity
and relieved pressure from the
board" to hold removal hearings.

Abraham said he and the board
“wish him the best of luck.”

hammers. hacksaws. and even 24~
and 48-inch boltcutters. it sells for
about $22.

To aid in the prevention ofbicycle
theft. the community relations sec-
tion of the campus police is conduct-
ing a survey to find the most utilized
bike rack locations. Using these
results they intend to step up the
observation in these areas.

Walters also recommended that
bicycle owners write down the bike‘s
serial number. Within a matter of
days. according to Watters. a stolen
bike can be back on campus with an
entirely new paint job: therefore. a
serial number becomes the only
means ofidentifyingastolen bike. In
the past years the campus police held
bicycle registration periods in the
beginning of the fall term. but the
number ofstudents that participated

was so small that the policediscon-.

tinued the service.

“lt’s too bad people don’t invest in

safety precautions,” said/Watters. T

“We/‘d rather prevent crimes then
prosecute people."

Carnegie M useu

By Ml|(E MALLINGER

Throughout the fall. Carnegie
Museum l.earning Program offers
adutts the opportunity to participate
in several programs aimed at
expanding horizons.

Eight six-week courses will be
taught by museum and university
scientists.

Pitt can boast oftwo departments
included in the program. whose
theme is “The Twenty-First C en-
tury: Our Human Future."

The Geophysics Department.
represented by Dr. Victor Schmidt.
offers a repeat of last year‘s highly
popular presentation. entitled “Our
Restless Planet: A Study of Volca-
noes. Earthquakes and Colliding
Continents.”

Schmidt reported that last years
class numbered more than 60. an
unusually high attendance. so the

. Ccpt

museum invited him back for a
second term. 0

Last year's version of "Our Rest-
less Planet“ occurred before Mt. St.
Helen‘s eruption. but this year
Schmidt has updated his course to
iricludeiphotographs of the moun-
tain "blowing its stack." he said.

Schmidt is attempting to tie the
fury of volcanoes and earthquakes
together in his lectures since. he says.
“it turns out volcanoes and earth-
quakes are caused by the motion of
continents.“

The theory of continental drift.
introduced in- l9l0.- occupies the
largest portion of. the lectures.
Schmidt said. adding that the con-
"has a rather remarkable
history."

When it was first presented. the
theory was fiercely debated in the
scientific community and absolutely
rejected. according to Schmidt.

The new theory clashed with the
accepted theory of the times that
of a shrinking earth.

“The analogy ofan apple that sort
of dried up was used. in that the
earth had shrunk a little hit- as it
cooled and the wrinkling ofthe crust
of the earth formed mountains.“ he
added.”

Even in l9l0. the shrinking earth
theory was not satisfactory. but
“people in those days just did not
like the theory of continents wander-
ing around the face of the earth." he
said. _

The continental drift theory ran
counter to the Bible to boot. The
notion was “that the Bible says
clearly that the mountains and the
ground are very solid. It was just a
matter of ingrained ideas." hchmidt
added.

scientific community's resistance.

Schmidt said that the globe used
then to depict the earth wasdifferent
than that used today.

“The globe at that time had fea-
tureless blue on the oceans." he said.
“rather than the Oceanic Ridge Sys-
tem currently acknowledged by
scientists." .4

The Oceanic Ridge System is a
continuous mountain range that
goes almost twice around the earth.
he added.

"The mountains were formed in
the splitting apart of the continents
and this is where they are splitting
apart. are moving farther apart.

where new ocean tloor is being

created. Today we realire that the
ocean floor is moving with the conti-
nents.“ he went on to say.

When pressed to explain the driv-

up. Schmidt pointed to earth’s
thermal energy. a very fierce force

It’s important for Oakland groups concerned
about ‘Oakland expansion to consider the pur-
poses behind the expansion before calculating its
effects on their neighborhood and organizing
opposition. . ,_

The difference is clearly illustrated by the ra-
tionale for the two projects: a $246 million expan- 5 ' I
sion of the University Health Center, and hotel
condominium complex. H

The proposed Health Center expansion, the
larger of the two projects, includes a Children’s
Hospital expansion, a new $40.mil1ion Eye and
Ear Hospital,a new medical building, and ‘a score

~ of other projects in the area surrounding Fifth ; V , “W W H -“ * M ,1,  -

the Syria Mosque and The Masonic: Temple, in.
the vicinity of the Schen-ley Farms neighborhood. .

While two groups—0al<land 1 Directions,
Incorporated, (ODI) and The Number - Four
Block Club,.have raised objections about the pro-
jects the validity of some of their complaints is
questionable. ‘ ‘

ODI has given its conditional approval to the
Health Center expansions, but is still worried
about the parking and transportation complica-
tions of the expansion. The Number Four Block
Club is withholding its approval until it is com-
pletely sure these concerns Will be met.

ODI is worried about the impact that a hotel
would have on the Schenley Farms neighbor-’
hood. “The homesare well maintained,_it’s a
jewel. And we have so few neighborhoods left like

that in the city,” Sandy Phillips, ODI president

said. _,
It was an intelligent move by ODI to approve,
although with certain conditions, the Health.

Center expansion. The center is not exactly on '
line with what the surrounding neighborhood.
7 may want because of complications for them. But

the center’s purpose far outweighs its possible
consequences in terms of parking and congestion
in the neighborhood. Improving and expanding
health care in Pittsburgh takes precedence over
regional concerns.- It is hoped“ that the Number

‘E Four Block Groups will recognize this and offer .

its approval also.

The merits of Oakland’s other major expan-
sion project are considerably more questionable.
A huge condominium hotel complex would
create havoc in the quiet ‘residential area that
surrounds it. It’s doubtful if another hotelis what
Oakland needs. In view of that, it is perfectly
justifiable for the residents to complain.

There is an obvious need for the university to
consider and plan for the effects of any proposed

expansion in the Oakland area. But it is equally ’

necessary for the affected residents to consider
the purposes of the expansion and weigh"them
against the possible consequences. -

Routine for kids? Yes! But,for col-

In the October. I9 edition of The

Mars said the incident that occurred
last Thursday night in the quad was
“routine for kids" showing an excess
amount of enthusiasm for the loot-
ball team.

I must seriously question that,
evaluation. S I

Is it “routine for kids” to throw
garbage cans (“can” implying metal.

hard and dangerous!) out of'their'

windows‘?
Is it “routine for kids” to throw

beer cans full of water that are
crushedon impact?

Is it “routine for kids" to throw
firecrackers‘ and bottlerockets that
could explode in someone‘s eye?

Is it “routine for kids” to throw
beer bottles, glass containers, bowls,
glasses and other dangerous objects
that could shatter upo—rTtlieir fellow
students‘?

Perhaps Sgt. Mars is correct. Now
that I think about it, it is “routine for
kids” not to realize that their actions
may be endangering the health and
safety of others. But what isn’t “rou-
tine” is the fact that college students
aren't “kids." They’re adults. And
they'll defend their right to be con-'

sidered adults with vengeance.

Enthusiasm for the foctball team
always meant balloons, confetti and
streamers; not busted heads. blinded
people and police. The dangerous
activity that took place iilthe Quad
last Thursday could hardly be con-
sidered “good-old football pageant
ry." It was violent, disruptive and
senseless.

The ban on all parties and alcohol
last weekend was fair and just pun-
ishment due to the mass involve-

ment. But it’s a shame that those 

who were capable of throwing beer
bottles out of windows don’t have '
the capacity to understand the ratio-
nale for such a ban.

Sadat: Another Point of View

Dear Editor:
As an Egyptian, I'd like to

respond to your opinion, ‘‘Sada\t's ,

Vision,” which appeared in the Pitt

-zalifewis Oct. 12. I’d like to clarify to the

following facts:

I. I agree that the death is neither
funny nor a cause of celebration.
Sadat’s assasination is a unique‘phe-
nomenon in Egyptian society andl
personaly condemn it as a way of
change. ’

2. Despite Sadat’s good figure

nationally, he was a real dictator. He - 1

made many decisions without any
regard to his people.'An example
would be his personal decision con-
cerning the “peace treaty" by which
he obligated Egyptians to accept it
as a way for welfare and prosperity.
The result of this was that Egyptian
intellectuals disagreed with him as
well as all ofthe Arab world since his
first visit to Jerusalem. A
3. As a dictator, Sadat had
deprived his citizens from express-
ing their freedom of speech. This
‘had been obvious in his Sept. 6

W crackdown, when he -jailed about

2,000 Egyptian figures who did

nothing except express their‘

thoughts.

4. Sadat tried to modernize Egypt
by borrowing the superficial aspects
of Western culture and not by apply-
ing American democracy and the

« 5. Sadat’s open policy allowed the
U.S. to build “bases" in Egypt to
defend the American interest in the
Middle East. As an Egyptian, I do
not, as many Egyptians. accept
either Americans or Russians in
Egypt.

b.Sadat invented a law to prohibit
talking about politics in any societal

institution including the universi-
ties, in addition to his responsibility
for appointing the presidents of the
universities.

7. Sadat‘s open-door policy
encouraged foreigners to construct
consumptive short-term projects-in
Egypt such as Coca-Cola and '7-U p.
This policy first affected our local
production. Second, it affected the
value of the Egyptian pound. Third,
it made rich people richer and poor
people poorer.

V These are some facts about
Sadat’s policy. I am wondering why
the American media always concen-
trates on American interest and not
the interest of the Egyptian people.

Why does the American media insist

‘on a one-man nation? Why is it sup-

porting dictatorship by not expand-
ing/the great American democracy
all over the Third World countries‘?
Did you forget the Shah's pheno-
menon?

I strongly agree with George San-
tana, the American philosopher.

history are condemned to repeat its
mistakes.“

‘Testy’ Experience

Dear Editor:
My friend, a recent graduate of

iAllegheny College in Meadville,

came last Friday“ to Pitt; seeking
employment. As she was first put off
by the complexities of Piﬂ"s campus,
I ‘persuaded her to see that it wasn’t
really that bad, only to have the
words thrown back into my face.
After braving a bone-chilling rain,
confronting 25 minutes of parking
lot “joy riding,” paying $3 to park in
an indoor lot (since the joy riding
proved fruitless), searching out the

interview,“ the interview was
incomplete; she had to take a’ typing
test.

Simple, you say‘? Just take the
test‘?

The “typing-test giver” was absent
from work that day. and no one else,
she was told. could give her the test.
Could she come back Monday‘?

Personnel—please. What’s so dif-
ficult about sloshing a piece of paper
in a machine and having someone
count up the number of words and

errors per minute‘! I've heard of. ‘I

bureaucracies before, but this is ri-
diculous!

When the test giver returns,
maybe they should test the folks
working in Personnel.

By CHRISTINE WILTANGER

Should the United States be con-
cerned over the election of Andreas
Papandreou as prime minister of
Greece?

University of Pittsburgh Profes-
sor Michael J. Flack, Greek gradu-
ate student iDmitris Kraniou and
York University Professor Tillo E.
Kuhn think that the U.S. is over-
reacting to Papandreou’s Socialist
Movement and his threats to with-
draw.Greece from NATO and the
‘European Common Market.

“We (in the U.S.) get too upset at
the word ‘socialist,’ ” according to
Flack, professor ‘of international
and intercultural affairs at the Grad-
uate School of Public and Interna-
tional Affairs. T

Kraniou ‘believes that it all
depends on “what you mean by
socialist. I do not think Papandreou
is a ‘pure’ socialist.”

Neither does Papandreou’s long-
time friend and colleague’, Tillo E.

iiKu'iiiiTpi$fe§s6F"Efiadiriiiiisfiaiive""'

studies and economics at York Uni-

~ versity, Toronto.

Kuhn says that “one good lead” to
what Papandreou’s socialism means
to Greece is Papandreou’s b.ook,De-
macmcy at Gunpoint, published by
Doubleday and Companyjn I970.

“I do thinkchapter six, “The Task
Ahead," tells a lot. He, talks about a
mixed economy for_ Greece‘-
moderate agriculture, a reform of
the Greek government and princi-
ples on which foreign investments
will be allowed into the country,”
Kuhn said in a telephone interview
Wednesday.

He quoted Papandreou from the ‘

book, “Our concept of economic
programming...invo|ves a harmon-
ious relationship between public and
private sectors in the context of a
modern, mixed economy."

Kuhn identified a mixedieconomy
as one “where the private and public
sectors work together.”

“Any modern state in the Western
world is a mixed economy," he said.
“Japan, the United States, Canada
and West Germany" are examples.

Papandre0u‘s plans to nationalize
certain parts of the Greek economy,
such as its’ "railroad system,
“shouldn’t scare us," says Flack.

'‘‘In ‘Europe, many things have

‘been socialized for years, like the

railroads and medicine."

 The United States, aceordingto A

Flack, has a tendency’ to think that
its way of government is thenorm
and judges other countries accord-
ingly, seeing them as unusual situa-
tions. That is not so, says Flack. “We
are the unusual situation.”

“Here in the U.S. we have no left-
ist party. Both the Democrats and
the Republicans are huddled in the

Also, in American ‘politics, t-here

Moderate. ‘-Moderate‘ is good in this
country. Sometimes I wonder if we
admire anyone who has ‘moderate’
intelligence.” , T ‘

Flack believes that poor nations
such as Greece need a more radical
plan to help get them back on the
road to economic recovery.

According to Flack, Greece has
three main industries. “It has inter-
national investment, it has tourism
and it has serv_ices which it performs
and for which it gets paid. The
American bases in Greece are an"
example of this.”

In his campaign speeches, Papan-
dreou has pledged to get rid of the

4.

American bases located throughout ‘

the Greek Islands. This pledge,
Flack believes, is a ploy by Papan-
dreou to secure more firm guaran-
tees from NATO and the U.S. of
protection in case of invasion by
Turkey, and to increase his bargain-
ing power with the U.S. and the rest
of the European community.

“Like any other politician,.he’s
trying to increase -his bargaining
power.”

Professor Kuhn agrees and-, call-
ing Papandreou ‘Andy,’ he says,
“Andy is an extremely intelligent
man. Look at the bargaining posi-
tion he’s in. He never committed
himself to NATO or the European‘
Common Market. And now he can
bargain.” '

Neither Kuhn, Flack nor Kraniou
think that Greece will- pull out of
NATO.

“If Greece would go out of
NATO, the arms would then goto

,  Andy knows that."
is what Flack calls “a cult of they

“lt would be foolish to say_ that
Greece is not important stratigically
to the U.S.--Papandreou\ knows
that,” according to Flack. He thinks
that Greece would like a guarantee
from NATO “for the security of the
Aegean Islands against Turkey. The
Aegeans are symbolically important
to the Greeks since that was where
all the great Greeks were born, ahd
are economically important because
of the oil that is located there.”

Kraniou thinks that while the “oil A

may be important in the next decade
for Greece, right now Greece wants
NATOito help solve the problem of
Cyprus.” According to Kraniou,
many A Greeks, including Papan-
dreou, have a mild distrust of both
the Americans and NATO because
of “the perception that the military
junta that overthrew Papandreou’s
father’s government was backed by
the U.S.”and because when Turkish
troops invaded the Greek island of
Cyprus in 1974, “the Turks carried
American weapons, and neither the
United States nor NATO did any-
thing about it.” ‘ - .

Both Papandreou and his father,
George, then the Greek prime minis-
ter, were captured and imprisoned
by that junta. The elder Papandreou
was held for six months before being
released and’ Andreas Papandreou
was held until President Lyndon B.
Johnson asked for his release. He
was released in the Greek Christmas
Amnesty of I967.

"Both Flack and Kraniou think
that what Papandreou_ hopes to gain
by his renewed bargaining strength
is more military aid to Greece, as

well as renewed respect from the
United States. ,

Flack sees the pledge of “termina-
tion of American bases“ as a signal

P that Papand reou “is intent on open-

ing negotiations with the U.S. He
wants to see to it. Greece gets greater
respect, more payment for the
American installations there and
more intensive support on the issue
of Cyprus from the United States.
That is absolutely normal politics.”

According.to Kraniou, “Greece,
till the middle l960s was the bastion
of American foreign policy in the
Mediterranean. Since then, for
many reasons, Americans have
chosen to agree with a neighbor of
ours—~the Turks. ln l973-74, the
Turks invaded Cyprus._ And it has
been suggested that America@gon—
tributed to the invasion, on the side

. of the Turks.”

Since then, Kraniou says, the
Greeks have been ignored by the
U.S. “The primary importanceto
Greeks is military and financial aid
from the U.S. They believe the U.S.
should follow a sliding scale” when
handing out aid to Greece and
Turkey.

Papandreou has stated that he
would like Greece to receive 70% of
what Turkey gets in foreign aid.

“That way,” says Kraniou, “the
balance -in the Aegean Sea will
change. It will be more even.”

But even increased American mil-
itary aid willnot guarantee Greece's
stability.

Flack cites the case of Iran “which
received horrendous amounts of
military aid, and still it didn't pre-
vent what happened.

Greece, should try to be more sensi-

tive to its internal problems. It is a
poor country that feels as though it
has been mistreated by the Western

world. After all, it was the place
' where democracy began. ‘

“Right now, the most important
relationship to Greece is its relation-

think if unusual or ungrateful that
Greece should be‘ so concerned
about Turkey, but it has been going
on for hundreds and hundreds of
years. In dealing with Greece, 1 think

Flack feels, however,‘ that
increased military aid “is useful only
if you are willing to fund social and
economic aid as well. That is what
keeps a country stable.

“Greece is too important strategi-
cally for the U;S. Just look at a map

tant. As a geopolitical area, it pro-

Pitt-Syracuse—Tale Of A

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

A Sometime last spring deep in the
bowels of the Syracuse sports pub-
licity mill, one of the hired pen-
pushers scratched his head and came
up the the slogan “The New Era" for
the l98l Orangemcn football team.
in its initial season under head coach
Dick MacPherson.

Despite such a grand motto and a
smart new coach. it‘s been the same
old swan song at Syracuse,just l-4-l
this season. with the same old
refrain-a-losing.

The Ora,ngemen.,latest foes for
the second-ranked Pitt Panthers in
tomorrow’s annual homecoming
game. have had but three winning
seasons in the last ll). years.

Things don't figure to get much
better this week against host Pitt. 5-0
and off to its best start since its I976
national championship season.

The chance of a letdown after last
week's emotional win over Florida
State looms as a distinct possibility

Student Reminder:

Ticket A N D l.D.
Mandatory

Pitt students are reminded
that they must have both a vali-
dated Pitt ID. and a ticket to be
admitted to Panther football
games. Just a Pitt ID. or only a
ticket will not gain them admis-
sion to the game.

talent by. oh. a lightyear or so. Or
as Pitt assistant coach Steve Heint-
zelman. who scouted Syracuse in
last week's loss to No. l Penn State.
delicately put it. “They were just

totally outmanned."

Still, Syracuse moved the ball sur-
prisingly well against the top-ranked
Nittany Lions. even though the 4|-
lti score. didn't show it.

Syracuse rolled up 345 yards.
including 236 in passing by quarter-

back David Warner. on lti comple-
tions in 30 tries. Warner. a
scrambling quarterback. also has
176 yards rushing. second on the
team behind running back Joe
Morris.

Morris. the Orangcmen‘s all—time
leading rushcr at a school. that
fielded Jim Brown and Larry
Csonka. is averaging 4 yards 21 pop
this year. with 527 yards on B0 car-
ries. ln concert with lugging the
football on the running plays. the
5-7, l82—pound Morris performs an
array of other duties for the Orange-
men equally well- ~he’s second on
the team in receptions with l5 and
has averaged an excellent 30.5 yards
a kickoff return. He‘s returned two
kicks for scores.

Helping ease the burden on Mor-
ris is a veteran offensive line and
wide receiver Willie Syndor. a
transfer from Villanova‘s defunct
football team. who is leading the
team with 23 receptions.

Linda Stadler‘s volleyball career
had been both long and circuitous
before arriving at Pitt. but since get-

and successful—~ -for a change.

Shelton Collier has called “one of
the most dominant middle blockers
in the East,”vis a large reason why the
Pitt team harbors strong hopes of
regaining the Eastern title it lost to
arch—rival Penn State last season.

it would be a happy ending to a
career that began eight years ago in a
high school gym in Fort Wayne.

and later made pitstops at the uni-
versities of Houston and Cincinnati.

Stadlcr began her collegiate
career at Houston. where she played
well enough in the rigid system there
to earn a starting spot as a freshman.
Despite her initial success. the expe-
rience at Houston was not what
Stadler thought collegiate volleyball
should be like -the “military” train-
ing. the regime the coach ran the
team through was a shade too over-
board for Stadler’s tastes.

Stadler left Houston for the
Midwest and Cincinnati. where she
put in one year playing in a system
that was in transition and lacking
stability.

“The year that I spent in Cincin-
nati. we lost our coach and things
just did not go well. Since l had two
years left to play. l wanted to go
somewhere that I could really con-
tribute.” Stadlcr said. “I had seen
'Pitt‘s coach. Shelton Collier. at a
tournament that summer and l was
very impressed with him so I gave
him a call. That was ‘the turning
point in my decision to attend Pitt."

After traveling through a large
chunk of the country to pursue her
volleyball career. Stadler has settled
down at Pitt to turn in two fine sea-
son‘s anchoring the middle of the
front line for the lady Panther
team. S

The job demands a variety of
skills good leaping ability. good
blocking technique and strong spik-

enn State Trounces Pitt  

By LISA GRENEVICKI

“Its going to be ‘a defensive
g‘ame—-our defense against their
offense.” said Pitt Panther To.m
Trempus before Tuesday’s game
with 8th-ranked Penn State.

And he was right, as the Pitt
soccer team was defeated by the Nit‘-"
tany Lions Tuesday 5-0.

The loss drops the Panthers
record to 8-4 on the season. How-
ever,in the West Penn Conference,
where they are in contention for the
league championship, the Panthers’
record is,still 6-0.

Pitt goalie, Scott Thurberg did at
fine job in the net limiting Penn
State to just five goals. Thunberg
had 15 saves on the relentless Nit-
tany Lions who took 27 shots "on
goal.\ ,

Penn State put their score on the
board midway through the first
period, when Peter Jancevski scored
on a hard shot from the left side.

The Pitt defense,/led .by Trempus,,
Jeff Dunn, Karl Heimbach and Don
Bowen, helped Thunberg shutdown
the Lion's scoring attaek for the rest
of the period, and the first half ended
with PSU in the lead I-0.

A few minutes into the second 

half. Panther Bowen and PSU’s Jan-
cevski received’ yellow cards for
unsportsmenlike ‘conduct.

' Just minutes later, with eight min-
utes gone in the second half, the Nit-
tany Lions-passed the ball smoothly
down the left side of the field to set
up their second goal. A PSU player
headed the ball to histeammate Pete
‘Jobling, who slammed a shot past
the outstretched hands, of Thum-
berg and into the corner of the net.

After the second goal, Pitt’s inten-
sity dropped markedly as PSU went
on to win 5-0. ,

‘‘Up_until the second goal, we were
in the game,” said Pitt Coach Leo
Bemis. “Our team played well,‘ but
Penn State had superior passing and
running."

Penn State showed good speed

 and ball control ontheir grass field.
«The majority of their shots were

taken from only 6 to ll) yards out.

“They’re a good team,” said
Thunberg. “Sometimes they had
clear shots from about 20 yards out
and I thought they’d shoot, but they

‘didn’t. They wait and work the ball

in close.” .
According to'Bemis, Pitt’s style of
play is not designed fo'r;a grass field.

[J

Pitt plays its home games on artifi-
cial turf.

“We play a short pass game,” be p
said. “On grass, the ball doesn‘t skip
as much as it does on turf and we
don’t have a full size grass fieldfto
practice on. -

“Our short pass game demands a  W

more physical effort. There's a

_cnance of losing the ball and you

must recover. lt tires you out when a
team like Penn State keeps inter-
ccpting your passes."

Although the Panthers were
handed a tough defeat. Bemis was
optimistic as he looked ahead to-‘
Pitt’s final home game Wednesday,’
against West Virginia Wesleyan.

“Our players gave a good account
of themselves," said Bemis. “Our
defense played well, but they had to
play too much defense: We’re going

to have to have ou.r.game together... if

for West Virginia Wesleyan.

“Our skill level is moving up. The _'
younger players are really coming,

on. The name ofthe game is control

and a team like Penn State has it. We .

will do everything to upgrade our
talent level.”

Pitt defenders Don Bowen (No. 4) and Tom Trempus. helped limit Penn State to one

rscores. V p i

For Pitt Coach Jackie Sherrill. it
has been a season of enjoyable

discoveries. 

“As great a team as we had last
year. the players (now) don‘t want to
play in its shadow. They want to be
recognized as their own team." Sher-
rill explained. “These young kids are
trying to establish their own iden-
tity. and thcy’re probably working
harder than any team We coached.“
Shcrrill said. i

According to MacPherson. thew

“We‘re playing against a great
football team. He has those kids
playing football the way I would like
our team to play. Those guys are out

Which can knock a lot ofhope out of
the sails of a team like Syracuse.

The Lady Panthers tennis team

Pitt's Randi Belkin easily con-
trolled her No. l singles match fora
6-4. 6—l victory. Accordingto Belkin
she was “a little worried“ about the
third consecutive meeting with this
opponent.

“l’ve played her (my opponent)
three times, but this was my best
match with her." Belkin said. “She
gets back every shot. but l played
real aggressive." Belkin added that
she‘s been “real pleased" with her
game.

In second singles action, Aldene
Lacaria suffered a 6-0, 6-2 setback.

“I couldn't play well." Lacaria
commented. “It was a lack of con-
centration on my part in both singles
and doubles. i had an off day.”

Jan Kastory followed in third sin-

The only other Lady Panther win
came from fifth singles Miriam

Finishing up the singles bids.
Pitt’s Jody Mattioli fell to a 6-1. 6-2
loss. According to Mattioli, who
was suffering from a shin splint.
injury, it was “a good match."

“My opponent was really good.”
Mattioli recalled. “But the match
was a lot closer than the score."

In first doubles play. Baughman
teamed up with Belkin for a split set
loss. 4-6, 6-1. 6-0. According to Bel-
kin. the duo “should have won" as
she attributed much credit to her
partner.

“Beth did real weil." Belkin said.
“She’s getting better with each
match. She will help the team out a
lot next year." '

Goltz and Lacaria doubled up for

a 6-3. 6-4 loss in second doubles

action while 1 Kastory and Lynn

' short. 6-2, 6-3.

All was not lost however. Accord-

Cathy Jacobson. one ofthe team's
singles’ aces, who sat out the match
due to injury. commented on the
season.

“Our season wasn’t as bad as our
record sounds.“ Jacobson empha-
sized. “We should have won at least
half of those matches. We did have
trouble with injuries :1 lot this year.”

The Lady Panthers close out the
season traveling to Allegheny Col-
lege on Monday.

“We’re really hoping to win this

one," Jacobson said. “I'm definitely
playing on Monday. Had the score
been closer. l would have played at
Slippery Rock.” She added that her
coach, George Dieffenbach. didn’t
want her to “chance it" with her leg
injury.

“We'll be out to win for our last

A win for the Lady Panthers
would be a nice way to end the sea-

Pitt lnA Romp; Notre Dame To Upset USC

U
By AMIN GHOSSEIN

After a sizzling 7-l-I performance

last week, l‘m on a roll. Myoverall
record is 23-l4, and the momentum

is gathering for an amazing season
of college football predictions.
Syracuse at Pitt: The betting line
gives the Orange 24'/2 poirits."No
matter who's playing, that’s a lot of
points. The Panthers, coming offan
impressive win over Florida State,
could face a letdown, and Syracuse
is the kind of team that has always
given the Panthers trouble.
Syracuse has Joe Morris, one of
the finest running backs in the coun-
try, so the Pitt defense will be mod-
erately tested. But the Orangemen
have no passing game whatsoever.

N0t—S0- Great— Race...

Are you a running enthusiast itch-

ing for some competition‘? Try the .

second annual "Not So Great Race"

Sunday, ‘Oct. 25, at 9 a.m., in Schen-

ley Park.

The concept of the 5- and l0-
kilometer race was developed last
year by residents of Bruce Hall‘s
dorm council. This year, the project
is sponsored by the fitness unit in
Brackenridge Hall.

There is a $4 entrance fee for the
race:-— entries are being accepted up
until the start of the race. Prizes
worth $200 will be awarded to the
top finishers and every participant
will receive a T-shirt.

Ryan redshirted...

Pitt men‘s basketball practice is
onlya week old and already the team
has its first redshirt.

John Ryan. junior guard, will not
play for the Panthers this season due
to his slow recovery from knee
surgery performed last winter.

According toassistant coach Seth
(ireenberg, in the long run the red-

\. . I _ _
shirt will be more beneficial for
Ryan.

“We don‘t want to take a chance

on injuring the knee again.” said

_4‘i;..)» lireenberg. “The rcdshirt is the best

 

for him. Our main priority to John is
his health for the rest of his life.”
Ryan saw minimal action for the
Panthers in I980-81.

Delaney signs...

Ofteri. tenure is not a good
enough reason to expect to stay in
the National Football League. Ask
Charlie Weaver.

Weayer. an ll-year veteran, was
released from the Detroit lions yes-
terday and replaced on the roster by
former Pitt safety Jeff Delaney. Del’-

one of the more pleasant surprises of
the year. Since its opening-game loss
to Pitt, Illinois has been putting
points on the board regularly. The
lllini will continue to do so-Illinois

North Carolina State at Clemson:
Take the Wolfpack and_ lSl/3 points.
its tough to beat Clemson when it‘s
playing at home. but NC. State has
a good team.

Clemson will win, but not by

much—Clemsoii 24, North Caro-.

Nebraska at Missouri: Nebraska
has‘n’t done much this year, while
Missouri has been a surprise team.
Look for a good game. and take
Missouri and seven points.

American Buffalo
Fine Line Theatre

The Fine Line Theatre Company's
production of American Buffalo was a
treat. There was a lack of urban sen‘-
sibilities, yet the play's interpretation
was only mildly injured, due to its
focus. on the comic aspects. lt was
some compensation, the pushing of
what was pathetically amusing, into
what was knee—slappingly funny.
The characters, their lot in life, evoke
a desperation, a certain blindness or
naivete that is beyond their compre-
hension. Throughout this perfor-

_ mance, the players saw that Don
‘»—l(Robert Koch), Teach (Fred Dona-

telli), and Bobby (John Waterson), the
only characters in this two-act play
about three lower class types and
their loyalties, had extremely myopic
visions of their futures, beyond the
next 24 hours. It is a moot point,
though some will debate whether
more sketchy details or scatter-
brained impulsiveness.

The play opens with Donny, the
owner of a junk/resale store sleeping.
A neat effect as the audience enters
the theatre space, was the fact that
Fred Donatelli’s Donny was already
stretched out on a cot, in full view for
at least five minutes before the start
of act one. The performance begins
with Bobby stopping in to just sit in

the shop with Don. The two com—“

municate with grunts and sober
stares, nods of their heads as simple
sign of recognition. This interplay
works well. Later, after initial

exchanges of words between Bobby,

 

THE GINGERBREAD LADY
Pgh. Playhouse

The New York audiences that
attended the 1970 run of Neil Sim-
on's The Gingerbread Lady received
something of a shock. They expected

 a typical Simon piece in the mold of

Barefoot in the Park or The Star Spangled
Girl, a witty but airy bit of fluffabout
characters who have one foot in the
world of television and the other in
that of Screwball Comedy. Instead
they saw a play that tells of, with
acceptable honesty, depression, lone-
liness, chronic alcoholism, and the
generation gap.

The Cingerliread Lady's plot centers on
Evy, a singer whose career and life
have seen better days. Evy has just
returned from a sanitarium, where

gwshe has taken the cure. Her friends

gather about her, anxious to offer
their support and prevent her relapse
into alcoholic self-destruction. Evy’s
daughter Polly arrives on the scene

and announces her intentions of
moving in, but this is a relationship
for which Evy does not feel prepared.

Despite the dramitic story line, Lady
is quite a funny play. Simon's genius
for ‘comic situations and spiffy one-
liners is everywhere in evidence. But
underlying the gags is a real world in
which problems‘ cannot be solved by
flip dialogue.

The original production closed

early to mixed audience reactions, -

but the play has generally been suc-
cessful in its frequent revivals. Fortu-
nately, this is true of the current
Point Park College production at the
Pittsburgh Playhouse. It is an enter-
taining, professional-quality effort.
This Lady will disappoint neither gen,-
eral theatre audiences nor hard-core
Neil Simon fans.

Director Thomas Hischak has

chosen to stage the play in the round.
The

intimate Theatre Downstairs -

lends itself admirably to this treat-
ment, and Hischak is adept at solving
the inherent problems of having an
audience on four sides.

Hischak has assembled a generally
fine cast, one that is sensitive both to
the rhythms of Simon's script and to
one another. Marco Kujovic is out-

standing aslJimmy Perry, a not-

terribly-successful Broadway actor.
Kujovic possesses both impeccable
comic timing and real emotional
depth. He steals every scene he is in,
and very nearly walks away with the
entire production. Kujovic plays
Jimmy Perry's homosexuality with
sensitivity and dignity, avoiding the
cheap cliche so often seen when an
actor portrays a gay character.

Creggory Geswaldo is a comic
delight as Manuel, a ‘finger-popping,

wise-cracking Hispanic delivery boy,-

James Darby projects virile intensity
as Lou Tanner, Evy’s off and on lover.

. eac over ears e con-
versation and wants to get in on the
action. Finding out anything from
anybody in this play is like pulling
teeth from a killer whale. Informa-
tion is well-guarded, the players are
careful here, and yet in many edx-
changes of thought, most notably,
when Teach speaks, gestures and

movement take away from the
importance of critical lines of
dialogue.

There are sequences when the tim-
img is as natural as conversation is in
life, and yet at other times, especially.

in the second act of the play, Teach ‘

moves around too much, for the
audience to hear what he has to say.
The undercutting bite of things that
Teach says when the plot to gain and
rob the coin collector starts to go
awry falls short of the humor that
/irneriean Buffalo brings to the stage by
understatement. lt loses its irony for
cheaper laughs at crucial points in the
short term careers of its characters.
At one point, Teach becomes so upset

that he commences to wreck the junk .

store, smashing everything in "sight.
This bails out most of the play from
being just for laughs, as well as when
Teach breaks a vase on the side of
Bobby's head. These sober the play,
and shows the reasoning for the set,
throughout most of the play being
such a clean junk store, broken glass
strewn all over, the confessions its
characters reveal make American Buf-
falo a success. And in this production,
the aforementioned is tight, yet it
could be tighter, dependent more on
the nervousness of the situation for
its appeal, than its pushiness.

Polly, and she is touching without

Claudia Smith's Evy is something
of a disappointment, however. She
handles herself well in some scenes,

particularly a birthday party for a ’

friend at which she falls off the
wagon and becomes more vicious
with each glass of champagne. But all
too often she rushes through her dia-
logue w._ithout really listening to her
fellow actors, steamrolling with
equal disregard over laugh lines and
genuine emotional moments.

. THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT’S WOMAN

By JANE HOLAHAN
. The first thing you notice about

oThe French Lieutenant's Woman is the

sheer beauty of the photography
which draws you into the film and
captivates you until you surrender to
the 19th century sensibilities that
overwhelm it. But because of the film
within a film structure of the movie

(we also see the actors who are mak-

ing the film) which constantly brings
in the 20th century, we don't go
down without a fight. A continual
snapping from the lush surrounding
‘of Victorian England to today's catch
as catch can world reminds us that
The French Lieutenant's Woman is only a
movie.

Meryl Streep, as Sarah Woodruff
and Jeremy Irons, as Charles Smith-
son, the man who becomes entwined
in her life quite desperately, bring the
characters of John Fowles novel to
life the first time we see them. It is
haunting, that first image, as Smith-
son, walking along the beach with his
adoring fiance, Ernestina (Lynsey
Baxter) first sees Sarah, dressed in a
huge black cape, looking out to sea.

Ernestina, being the proper Victo-
rian lady she is, quickly tells Smith-
son that she is being shunned by the
community (The story takes place in
Lyme Regis, on the southern coast of
England) because she once had an
affair with a French lieutenant, who
then abandoned her. But that look
Sarah gave Smithson: there is none
of that passion contained in Ernesti-
na's eyes. The-cards are all dealt as
soon as Sarah and Smithson first set
eyes on each other.

Sarah is not a 19th century woman,

True Confessions makes it very clear
that Robert DeNiro is the kind of
movie star who is so good and so much
a star that he can transcend his
character. When we are watching
DeNiro play father Des Spellacy in
True Confessions we aren't watching an
actor, we're watching a real priest.

The presence of DeNiro “alone
would be enough to make True
Confessions an above average film, but
what makes it even morefascinating
is the rest of the case, headed by
Robert Duvall, who plays DeNiro's
brother, Tom. Everyone in this film,
without exception is incredibly good.
Familiar actors like Charles Durning,
Ed Flanders, and Burgess Meredith
turn a mediocre story plot into a
fascinating character study of the
film noir world of L.A. in the 1940's.

The screen play, by Gregory
Dunne and Joan Didion, from
Dunne's novel is very hard boiled and
stereotypical. There's the tough cop,
who's really a softie, the thoughtful
priest, the corrupt businessman
(played wonderfully by Charles
Durning) and his cronies, who aren't

. quite as sleazy, but iustas corrupt (Ed

Flanders has got the part down pat)
and even a prostitute with a heart‘ of
gold (Rose Gregorio looks perfect for
the part)._

But it doesn't matter that they're
cliches because the dialogue is sharp
and right on the mark, their being
stereotypes is part of their character,
but stereotypes need to be involved in
exciting stories to make themworth
watching.

The problem ’ is that after the

has constantly noted this though its
narrator, but a movie is another mat-
ter. So, screenwriter Harold Pinter
solved the problemain a unique way.
This would become a film within a

son, as she knowsshe must, she must
bring him down in her misery.
Jeremy Irons, as Smithson is, upon
first glance, nothing like Sarah. He
seems serene and happy in his role as

Meryl Streep in "The French Lieutenant's Woman, "'

"film. Meryl Streep would play an

actress having an affair with her co-
star, so in effect she would be playing
two actresses, both with very differ-
ent attitudes.

Meryl Streep is the only actress
you can conceive of to play Sarah.
Hers is a complicated role-—a 19th
century  Jinan who wants passion-
ately to love a man, but who is con-
stantly told she must suffer to do so.
So the suffering becomes part of her,

a Victorian gentleman, until the fate-
ful moment he sees e-Sarah, then
nothing is_the same. It can't be the
same-—he has fallen passionately in
love, and there is no room in Victo-
rian England for that kind of love.
The world around Sarah and
Smithson shelters them like a cocoon,
and soon they begin to feel trapped,
and smothered. Disapproving eyes
follow each of them constantly in one
form or another. The pressure build

TRUE CONFESSIONS

characters have been set up so
perfectly the story fails to do
anything with them. It presents them
to us in an extremely confident

manner, but then the story doesn't,

have anything for them to do. The big

. explosive ending that we are always

anticipating never occurs.

Basically True Confessions is a
character study of the Spellacy
brothers. DeNiro, who usually plays
explosive men (like last years Jake

LaMotta in Raging Bull) is very low
key and restrained here. He is very
troubled by his church's dependence
on businessman Jack Amsterdam
(Charles Durning) and the way the
church is using» his money. DeNiro's

is the most difficult role in the film
because there is no flash in the
character. Father Spellacy is a calm
man, not given to fits of rage like his
brother Tom. DeNiro dominates the

screen because, as he usually does he

to a climax and then explodes-both
their worlds fall around them, until
they both must leave the repressive
society that has held them prisoner.
But they cannot leave that society
together, that is impossible.

Meanwhile, in this century, as the 

actors struggle to create a century
gone past the same questions linger
on. The actors (called Anna and Mike)
playing Sarah and Smithson, though
both married to others, have fallen
in love. But this is a twentieth cen-
tury love story, and their choices are
different, though not necessarily bet-
ter. Anna may be a modern woman,
but she is still a woman, and Mike is
still a man.

Wrapped in all of this is the magical
surface beauty of Victorian England.
Freddie Francis’ photography is stu

I n‘
W118, and the characters blend into *

wonderfully, but there is something’
melancholy in all this beauty. The
repressiveness of the society—
nobody smiles or laughs, is con-
stantly contrasted to the beauty of
the countryside.

Everyone is quite good, including
Hilton McRae as Sam, Smithson's

manservant, who casts a dissaprov- '

ing' glance over his shoulder, and
Charlotte Michell as Mrs. Tranter,
Sarah's employer, who is the embodi-
ment of Victorian England's
repressiveness.

But Streep and Irons carry the pic- . .
tufe, and they are both marvelous”

They give life to characters who
could have remained cold stereo-
types. It is quite remarkable, consid-
ering the incredible photography,
that it, is the characters we
remember, not the scenery.

thoroughly BECOMES father
Spellacy.

His brother Tom is the perfect

"contrast. His feelings always remains

close to the surface, and every once
and a while he explodes in fits of rage.
Duvall is an electric actor, and you
feel as though something is alway
going to happen when he's on screen.
Tom used to be on the take, whenhe
was a bag man for Jack Amsterdam at
one of his cat houses and he's now out
to get Amsterdam to assuage his own
guilt and prevent his brother from
getting too involved with him.
Amsterdam is trying to clean up his
image, but things get hot when a
prostitute who used to know him is
found murdered. Tom is sure that

Amsterdam is involved in the murder '

and he'll go to any lengths to prove
he's guilty, even going so far as to

drag his brother down withg...._,

  

Amsterdam. '

The conflict between the Spellacy
brothers is the main theme of the
film, and while it is nice to see a film
about people True Confessions needs a
little action to back it up. Because the
characters are stereotypes they need
a crackerjack plot to keep things
rolling. Unfortunately True
Confessions, while it delivers the actors
does not deliver the story. '

The best scene in the film is one in
which the two brothers visit their
mother who has gone senile, in the
hospital. It is all cliches, pure a_
simple, but it works thanks to Duvall
and DeNiro. Of course a whole film
cannot be worked out with
stereotypes, even if two of the best
actors in the world are its stars.

Break it, rape it, blow it up, but
watch out for Laura, she's a "trea-
cherous little dickens.

Laura is the main character in Beth
and Scott B's film, The Offenders. This
sound—sync 'super-8 artifact from
New York's new wave underground
pays hommage to the classic"B" films
of the 50's,‘as it paints a bleak mural
of the vacant life after punk.

The Offenders wraps a string of ridic-
ulous crimes around the attempt, by
Laura, to reach a reconciliation with
her estranged, and often strange
father.

The film, begins with a slow zoom
in on the father, played by Bill Rice, as
he grown increasingly frantic over
the fate of his missing daughter. This
scene is.the most appealing of the
entire film. _

Rice, and theimmediate clutter of
his desk seem to hang suspended in
darkness, as the telephone teasingly
deals him one blow after another.
First a call from his daughter, which
is‘cut short, then, the catatonic voice
of a menacing stranger, which turns
out to be the evil Lounge Lizard,]ohn
Lurie.

Suddenly the scene shifts to an

apartment where Laura is being help
captive. There are several extended
soap opera—like organ chords, some
'incredib‘ly stupid dialogue, and the
climax: Laura's escape, by smashing a
bottle over Lurie's head while his
back is turned.

For the rest of the picture, gangs
rough up members of\‘rival gangs,
individual gang members commit
robery, rape, and mayhem, and at one
point, Laura gets her revenge on the
evil Lounge Liiard when her compa-
triots kidnap him, and she eventually
kills him.

Bert Reynolds has to be unique
among actors and actresses in the his-
tory of cinema in that no one else has
ever turned out success after success
in which they do little more than por-
tray themselves under someﬁalias and
back it with a little post—card scenery.
His latest, Paternity, falls neatly into
this category alongside its kin Hooper,
The End, Srnokey I ¢'« II, and Cannonball
Run. I sometimes can imagine Rey-

finally reunited with her father. But
after a cozy mean, and a few drinks,
she tells him that she has killed a man,
and, as had often been the case during
her youth, her father sneaks out to
call the cops. Laura escapes, and mas-
terminds a city-wide crime wave,
which eventually includes the con-
tract killing of her father.

The Pittsburgh appeagance of The
Offenders, accompanied by the film's
producers, the B's, last Thursday
night at the Carnegie Museum of
Art, prompts one to ask the question:
What is this shit? And what is itdoing
in a museum?

The B's themselves weren't much
help on this one; they maintain that
such self—conscious adoption of 50's

cheap movie technology is an apt 

means of expression for the 80's. This
for becomes, for them, a vehicle for
"savage satire."

saying, "Aw hell, what do ya wanna
do next?" Why not pack up the equip-
ment and go to New York City; sorta
like a grown—up’s field trip?

Paternity marks the directorialdebut
of David (The End) Steinberg who
does little to redeem this frail but
harmless comedy in which Reynolds
plays Buddy Evans, a single, likeable,
and worrisome man who manages
Madison Square Garden, lives in a
beautiful apartment, and has just
turned 44. His worries stem from the
fact that if it were all to end, nothing

 

The "B's" have received a great deal
of good press, especially in New York,

for their innovative and unique
approach to film—making. I. Hobber—
man, of the Village Voice, called the
B's work. "at times brilliantly
primitive."

Noel Carroll, of the Soho News,

' wrote that "The Offenders transforms

its denial of polish into a defiant dec-
laration of the rights of the ugly and
the imperfect.”

Who are they trying to kid? Tllff
whole point of 50's B flicks is that the

directors managed to put together
something passable, and at times

almost entertaining, on a shoe string

Sam Fuller was not an intentional
primitivist, and Roger Corman did
not attempt to express a particular
concept in terms of low—budget pro-
duction. These directors are recog-

but before everyone can live happily
ever after, there's still an hour of
movie to see. Thus we are treated to a
barrage, some funny, some not, of
one—liners and sexual wisecracks.
This certainly falls short of great
comedy but Paternity does boast some

creativity to aecrude medium, namely

we were writing this time. The
last timeegwe were pretty much
groping for a style, for an over-
all direction in the songs.

SHOW: sWould , you say that
your music is meant to be taken

at face value, or is there some ’

meaning behind it?
DONNIE: There's meaning to

it, but basically, it's just to be

taken for what it is——to listen to
and enjoy. But there are things
that talk of love, what love is
and what it isn't.

SHOW: Some ‘of your songs
tend to be tongue-in-cheek. Do
you think that a lot of today's
music is too serious?
DONNIE: Once in a while we
like to do off—base songs like
that just for a change of atti-
tude. However, there is a place

everyone else.

SHOW: What about your’
neighbors and your family, do
they treat you like a normal
guy? -

DONNIE: Well, after the intial
hiatus things have pretty well
settled down back to the normal
groove in the neighborhood,

_, but for a while it was every day

people knocking on the door for
autographs and stuff——but it's
really no hassle. (Can you believe
this guy? He's really disgustingly nice!)
SHOW: You've got a wife and

' kids; is it tough to raise a family

and be a rock-n—roll singer at the
same time? ‘ '
DONNIE: I wouldn't consider it
tough———at this point anyway. If
we had to go out and do a 6-8
month tour it would be rough. E

IIIIE

UIIEUIIS  

in music for both types of music,
serious and off~beat. When
Mark Avsec and I get together
to write songs we like to try to
cover a lot of bases if we can and
find some—different approaches
to songwriting.

SHOW.: The last time I talked to

you, you said that you were
"just an ordinary guy." Do you
still feel the same way?

DONNIE: Oh yeah. Basically,
that's what I really am. When
we get up on stage’, of course,
things. change—~it's like an
outlet, it's a different side of the
band and me. The rock star
thing—it's just something that
the media labels us as. Basically,

we're all just ‘working stiffs like

Basically, I like to go out for a 4

month and come back home for
a few weeks and go back out
again. If we can keep it at that
level I. think everything will
work out. It's when you're away

from home for too long that the »

problems start to occur.
SHOW: Doyour kidslike (‘their
Daddy's music?" '
DONNIE: (laughs) Oh yeah.

i SHOW: Is there a bond between

you and other Pittsburgh bands
like the Houserockers,
Silencers, G-Force, and Norm?
DONNIE: For sure. They're all
friends of mine, man. The Gra-
nati Bros. live two blocks away
from me. Norman and I keep in
touch——we talk iust about every

week or two. The Houserockers
are also on MCA, so there's a
bond there. Sometimes it's
tough but we try to keep in
touch—even if it's just a phone
call.

SHOW: Are you afraid of wak-
ing up one day and finding
you're not what the public
wants? —

DONNIE: Not at all. I just go A

out and do the gigs with the
guys and hope that we go over,
if not, I do__the studio thing—I'll

keep busy one way or the other. i I

The whole rock star thing really

doesn't inpress me all that ‘V

much.

SHOW: Do bad reviews bother  I

you?

DONNIE: It's hard to say that
they don't bother you. In my
case, if I see a review that's not
quitewhat we wanted it might
hit me wrong for a little while
but it goes away real fast.
SHOW: What's the worst part
of the ‘music business?
DONNIE: Let me think...Proba-

v bly just waiting week to week to .

see what your record is doing. If
it's moving real well it's just
fine, but you get to points
where it's levelling off or drop-

ping and that gets you down. It's .

also not easy toget your records
out there and get them played.

E You want your records to do,
well, that's what keeps you

going. You do a live show and
you want all the people there to
know the words to your songs.
We know we've got a good

strong kick-ass live show, but if

the songs are strange to the
audience then itmakes it tough.

SHOW: How long do you figure

you'll be in the business? .
DONNIE: I'll be in music for the

rest of my life'—,_it’s just some-

thing I've done all ‘my life."

Whether it's on stage orin the
studio producing somebody I'll
be involved in that» I'll pretty
much stay in itﬁone way or the
other.

SHOW: Any last comments,
critcisms, etc.? .
DONNIE: Yeah, other than

music I'm real heavy into sports

and I'm a fan of every sports
team in Pittsburgh. I've been
checking out Pitt lately and I dig
what they've been doing.
Dwight Collins is from down

here (Beaver Falls) and I wish all '

the best to him and the Panth-

_ers. So make sure you tell the

team, to go get'em all the way,
man.

BLOOD ON THE BRICKS
The _Iron City Houserockers
MCA

KING COOL

Donnie Iris and the Cruisers

‘MCA

For a lot of people rock and
roll is a concept-—act tough and
rough and rebel through it, but
then drive home. behind the
frosted‘ windows of your limou-
sine. That’s why the Iron City
Houserockers appeal to so many

national critics; rock and roll V

,isn’t a concept for them, it's a
reality. There's no limousine for
the Houserockers, they haveia
reason to be angry and their.
music is a genuine reflection of
that anger.

Pittsburgh is the perfect
backdrop, it's a blue collar town,
the kind that gave birth to
rough, urban rock and roll. But
anybody who tends to lump all
Pittsburgh music under the
umbrella of the Houserockers
should compare Blood on the
Brirks, the latest release from
the Houserockers, with King
"Cool, Donnie Iris’ latest album.

The difference between Iris
and the Houserockers reflect
the diversity of Pittsburgh
music, and the two albums
could well stand as a landmark
for this city in the rock world.

Neither album is their best
effort, but both show a matur-
ity and confidence fhat is
appealing and reassuring-—they
are here to stay.

Iris’ album is all concept—but
then that's what pop music is.
King Coal is all about adolescent
angst, and his biggest problem is
keeping his girl by his side.

”Sweet Merilee” is the best
song on the album and one of
this years’ best pop songs. The
lyrics are all throwaways;
"Merilee please don't go/l need you
so/You've got to know/l’ll never let you
go" is about as deep as Iris gets.
But the innocence is part of the
charm. Unfortunately a lot of
the songs (most of the second
si_degin fact) don't match the pop
brilliance of ”Sweet Merilee,”

and a few, like the title song, are
downright stupid. On the
whole, King Coal is a harmless,
bouncy trip.

’ The Houserockers are living
in a totally different world.
There is a desperation in Blood
On The Bricks that's nowhere to
be seen on King Cool and this
makes the Houserockers’ album
the more interesting of the two.
These are real songs about real
people in trouble, not products
of an ivory tower recording
studio.

Blood On The Bricks drives
home its message from the
opening song’ ”Friday Night”
through to the bitter end of "A
Fool's Advice," and the message
is clear, you've got to escape any
way you can. The album is filled
with hard guitar licks, and
tough boozy bar room vocals
from Joe Grushecky.

Grushecky isn't a great vocal-
ist, but he makes his point, and
the same is true of the whole
album. The driving force of the
message and the genuineness of
it are enough to pull Blood On The
Bricks above most of the musical
fare around today.

The problem is that as rough
urban rock and roll becomes
more and more fashionable, the
message from the House-
rockers is beginning to sound
repetitive. We have heard all of
this before from the likes of
Springsteen and the Asbury
Jukes. Therefore, even though
the Houserockers are the
genuine article, their music
sounds a little pat. Part of the
problem is Steve Croppers’ non
descript production, but even
so, Blood On The Brirks gets across
its message and the House-
rockers are to be commended
for once more focusing atten-
tion on Pittsburgh. Ofcourse,
it is becoming more and more
difficult to classify Pittsburgh
rock and roll, thanks -to its
growing diversity, and that's a
healthy sign. Donnie Iris and
The Iron City Houserockers
only prove that this town has a
lot to say, and has a lot of differ-
ent ways to say it.

GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT
THEY WANT

The Kinks

Arista

It’s time again for Ray Davies’

S semi-annual analysis of the

world. And, as usual, it's right
on target. .

This disk is very much the
brother of the last Kinks’ studio
album, Low Budget. You get the
same aggressive, almost punky
beat and you get the same dis-
section of the trials and tribula-
tions of living in the last quarter
of the 20th Century. All served
up with a grain of salt and a
fatalistic, though cheerful,
chuckle.

The title track and ”Around
The Dial” are very much in this
vein. It's the exceptions,
though, that make these cuts
stand out. Take ”Destroyer" in
which Ray and the boys have
some fun with some of their
moldy oldies. Using the riff
from "All Day And All Of The
Night” and an affair with a girl

named Lola, Ray kicks off with:
"Girl, l want you here with me; but
I'm really not as cool as I'd like to he/'
as Ray's prudish character tries
to break out.

”Art Lover" follows the day of
an English eccentric who likes
little girls (you figure out why).
Ray and company finish up with
”Better Things,” which could be
a song’ by Paul M. if Mr.
McCartny wasn't afflicted with
terminal sentimentality. All
in all. it's another good Kinks
album. And why shouldn't it be?
They've only been doing it for
seventeen years now.

sNAz
Nazareth
A&M

Last March I found out how
powerful and exciting Nazareth
is in concert. I thought ’5N/iZ,
live-double album, would
posess that power and excite-
ment but it was not to be. On
'5N/iZ they sound lifeless. The
Heavy Metal Spirit was lost

between performance and
vinyl. Nazareth is capable of
better. I’m sure their fans will
like the album; it is loaded with
all the biggies. ”Love Hurts,”
”Hair Of The Dog," ”Expect No
Mercy,” and ”Beggars Day" are
just one fifth of the fare offered.
Even these standards are played
listlessly. I expected more and
came away disappointed. Need-
less to say 'SN/iZ is not highly
recommended. This is a cure for
insomnia.

GEORGE HOLZER

DEAD RINGER
Meat Loaf
Epic

When Meatloaf released his
debut’ al-bum, Bat Out Of Hell, he
made waves in the music busi-
ness. Although it has taken him
quite a while to release his
second, it was well worth the
wait. With Dead Ringer Meatloaf
is in fine voice; he slides through
most of the songs with meaning
and style. Jim Steinman’s
incredible lyrics add to the

impact of the album. With
words like: "I can't stand to see it no
more/ The way you're living with a
goddess/ but you treat her like a slave/
And you can't hold her hack anymore/
She's like a dreamer in a dungeon/ or
an angel in a rave." Meatloaf aims
for the ladies hearts—and
scores.

Side one begins with ”Peel
Out,” a fast rock number that
leads into the hit single ”I’m
Gonna Love Her For Both Of
Us,” which, incidentally, is
nowhere near the brilliance of
”Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad”
(from the first LP). Much better
are: ”I’m Gonna Kill You If You
Don't Come Back” and ”Read
’Em And Weep," two smooth
rock songs that sizzle under
Meatloaf’s searing voice.

Dead Ringer IS a very good
album, Meatloaf’s rock ’n roll is
contagious. I wonder low long it
will take him to release his third
album, but, no matter, it'll prob-
ably be worth the wait.

TORCH
Carly Simon
Warner Bros.

‘f

Carly Simon has spent most
of her career trying to prove

that she is not a self—pitying

poor little rich girl, so Torrli, her
collection of classic torch songs,
might seem somewhat
regressive. in every song, poor
Carly has been stomped on
("Blue of Blue"), abandoned ("l'll
Be Around," ‘'1 Get Along
Without You Very Well"), or
lied to ("Hurt"), but because
they are such marvelous songs,
by the likes of_Duke Ellington

and Hoagy Carmichael, the»

mood is not one of self-pity.
These are torch songs, and a
good torch songer wants the
audience to know that she's
been hurt, but that she's wiser
and tougher now for the
experience. These songs allow
Simon to be frighteningly
vulnerable, yet strong at the
some time. \
Simon's voice is wellsuited to

these classy songs——she has a
husky, strong voice that doesn't

need any tricks to sound
emotive. The best songs here,

like "Body and Soul," ”I Got It
Bad, And That Ain't Good" and
"I Get Along Without You Very
Well" are delivered straight
with simple arrangements by
producer Mike Maineri. The
production is Cbasically sleek,
sparse, and modern, with alot
of emphasis on saxaphones
(supplied by David Sanborn and
Michael and Randy Brecker)
and Warren Bernhardt's piano.

Simon's voice has always
been more impressive and

.. consistant than her writing
“ability and it doesn't let her

down in Torrh. There is a

‘ maturity here that suits Simon

extremely well.‘ ,

If the only place you have
heard torch songs before was in
old Warner Brothers cartoons
(follow the bouncing ballll),
Torch is a fine introduction to a
bunch of real classy songs.

REFLECTOR

2 Pablo Cruise

' A&M

The problem with so many
bands today is their abhorrence
for diversity, or is it fear? Like

fat cats, contemporary groups

are perfectly satisfied to,

chronically churn out identical
“album after identical album.
The Cars, Foreigner, and
Boston come immediately to

A mind. After breaking into music

with a unique sound, these
bands have lulled in the
sameness that brought them to

znotoriety in the first place.

There is no experimentation, no
maturity in their music.

Pablo Cruise is one such band,
and their latest release Reflector is
one such album. ‘i

When their platinum albums
/l Plrire in the Sun and Worlds /iway
came out, Pablo Cruise offered a

pleasant alternative to the

heavy metal sound of the time.
The band's pleasant harmonies
and clear vocals of Cory Lerios
and Davidlenkins, gave a sort of
soothing effect; a sort of ’’feel
good” music which made you
drift into a joyful daydream. it
was a refreshing ‘sound and
promising.

It no longer is.

Withthe Reflertor album, Pablo

Cruise has stepped into the trap
of apathy. The music has
become a tired and tried repeti-
tion. Like a polished comedian

»who has done his skit a thou-

sand times, Pablo Cruise is no
longer singing with emotion but
merely going thru the motions.
Reflector isn't an album but a
clone. Only two songs appear to
have promise; "Cool Love," and
"Drums in the Night.” Both at
least attempt to display any kind
of experimentation———a com~
modity lacking with the rest of

the album. '

DURAN DURAN

Duran Duran
Capitol

Duran\Duran is: Simon Le
Bon-vocals; John Taylor—bass,-
Roger Taylor—drums; Nick
Rhodes-keyboards; Andy
Taylor—guitar.

Duran Duran isn't: a bunch

of pseudo~New Romantics; the

. frilly garb and hair—dos are little

more than five boys having fun
dressing up, and also, an
attempt to get recognition from
trend—grabbing audiences.
Duran Duran is: a very talen-
ted quintet .whose music is
hauntingly catchy.» Songs like

"Planet Earth," "Girls On Film,"
"Careless Memories," and
"Friends of Mine" are ilifferent
enough to be lumped into the

\. New Romantic/Blitz classifica-

tion, but they're really good
enough to stand alone. Don't be
surprised if you hear yourself

. singing "Girls On Film" in your

sleep—v—it"s that good.

Duran Duran is: a bunch of
excellent, thinking lyricists.
Their lyrics read like something
outofacult—movie scene set-up:
"l.i;i5t:'rl< (lzcrry all over the lens as

DON'T STOP
Billy Idol
Chrysalis

If you've never heard of Gen-

eration X, then chances are ‘

you've never. heard of Billy Idol,
either. Idol formed the band in a
punked-out Great Britain in
early 1976, following with sev-
eral hits like, "Wild Youth,”
"Ready Steady Go," and the
band's last effort, "Dancing
With Myself" (released under
the name of "Gen X"). Bored

tion, he moved to New York last
winter to, in his own words,
”generate something young and

exciting." And the man doesn't‘

lie—,Don't Stop, although just a
four—song EP, is a most invigo-
rating record.

Idol does a cover of the classic
Tommy James and the Shon—
dells' hit, "Mony Mony" (did
you catch him doing it on Solid
Gold a few weeks ago?) that not
only does the original justice,
but perhaps even surpasses it on
sheer energy alone. A crashing,

thunderous set of drums rever-

berates beside the class—trash
lyrics and you can practically soc’
Motown girls shimmying dur-
ing their back—up vocals.
”Dancing With Myself". is
included here also, as it should
be. ‘Why it never went to
number one in the St/ates. is one
of the great mysteries of life, for
it's a sure cure for whatever ails
you. A Gen X standard called
"Untouchables" and a brand
new idol composition called

"Ba by Talk" are just as arresting

as the rest of the EP. ‘

If you're sick of so called
"punks," don't be put off by
ldol's spikey, peroxided blond
mop on the cover, for he's no
mealy-mouthedhold-back from
that era. He's one in a million.
