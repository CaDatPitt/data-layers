Pocket Breathalyzer meant to save lives  

KATIE LEONARD
Assistant News Editor

Most 21-year-olds enjoy going out for
a drink with their" friends. But not all of
them worry about how_ they — or people
they don’t know — are getting home after-
ward.

Fortunately for them, Phil Laboon has
put a lot of thought into how he, and oth-
ers, will stay safe. The creator of the Save
a Buddy Campaign started distiibuting
one—tirne use Breathalyzers in the Strip
District about a month and a half ago, to
help deter people from driving while
intoxicated. The Breathalyzer, which
comes in a waterproof key chain, contains
a tube with yellow crystals. To use it, a
person must breathe into thetube for 12
seconds. If the crystals remain yellow, the
person is good to go — at least, according
to the law. If the crystals turn blue, he or
she carmot legally drive. *

' After losing two friends to drunk dri-
ving accidents, Laboon contacted Mothers

_' “wanted to do something more than just

volunteer.” Laboon, a successful

Web designer, decided to do work on his I

own. He bought 5,000 Breathalyzers,
spending about $10,000 of his own
money.

To getthe word out during the ﬁrst
few weeks of his program, Laboon gave
away about 2,000 Breathalyzers. He
began selling them, about three weeks
ago, near bars and clubs.

His staff now sells between 15 and 20
units an hour, every night, and he expects
to sell about 100,000 units every month.

Though the group charges individuals
for the Breathalyzers, proﬁt is not the goal
of Laboon’s program.

“Right now, we’re just interested in
saving lives,” he said, adding that he is
interested in making Save a Buddy a non-
proﬁt organization, but he first needs to
earn enough money to pay for a lawyer
who can sort through the red tape. «

According to MADD’s Web site,
there were 17,419 deaths caused by alco-

An average of 18 people die each day waiting for an
organ uansplant Last year, 6,598 people died because they
couldn’t receive a new organ in time.

But a Pit: professor believes monetary, compensation
could attract more people to the donor pool, increasing the
number of available organs while providing a token of grat-
itude — in cash —— to the families of organ donors. ,

A group of 22 surgeons, scholars, clergymen and civic
leaders from across the nation created the Ad Hoc
Committee for Solving the Intractable Organ Shortage. Pitt
neuroscientist Dr. Harold Kyriazi founded the committee,

which also includes Dr. John Fung, Director of the ‘Thomas

E. Starzl Transplantation Institute, as a member. ,
Improvements in technology and techniques have made

organ transplantation a viable and life-saving option for peo-

ple who would otherwise die from the health problems that
accompany failing organs, according to the committee.
But as the success of organ transplants grows, so does

the demand for viable organs. The need for organs led the
committee to send a joint letter to Congress on May 19,
proposing monetary compensation to families for organs.
from the recently deceased. ' .

. Such compensation was barmed by an act of Congress-
_ nearly 20 years ago. Concerned that oﬁering money for ’

organs would lead to black market organ harvesting — the
exchange of money for living people’s organs, which could
then be sold illegally at a high price to those desperate for

organs with a ﬁnancial incentives provision to the National

-Organ Transplantation Act of 1984. ,

I, The committee proposes a partial lift to the ban, allow-
ing money only for cadavers’ organs.
. “We offer a consensus proposal that, we believe, will

' result in analmost immediate and substantial increase in the
rate " of cadaveric organ donation,” committee members A

wrote in the letter: “We believe it constitutes the most viable
compromise between using the power of market forces to
satisfy human need, while at the same time recognizing the

_  reluctance to; having human body parts being

treated, undigniﬁedly, as commodities.” - ' .
Under the committee’s proposal, donor families woul

I receive a gift of $5,000. All families would receive the same
monetary gift, regardless of ' how many —— if any — of the

deceased’s organs areused. 0 y .

According to the comrnittee’s proposal, the Department
of Health and Human Services, along -with other organ pro-
curement organizations, would also conduct trials of the
monetary compensation system, determining its effective-
ness. While the money could produce a great increase in the

number of available transplant organs, some people are con-
V cemed about me repercussions of lifting the ban. -

The National Kidney Foundation’s organ procurement"
organization does not support the comrnittee’s plan.
“There are a couple of reasons why We’re troubled by

this-plan,” said Jennifer Martin, donor services program

director of the Foundation. “We’ ve spoken with families, and
many of them feel that it’s an-insult to donor families to offer

themlmoney for this gift. To add money cheapens this act. of

21-year-old is
force behind
distribution

Breathalyzer, page 1

Pittsburgh Institute of Technology after
attending Indiana University of
Pennsylvania for a few years, is interested
in hiring college students to distribute the
Breathalyzers in "bars and clubs in the
South Side and Strip Distiict.

He’d like to distribute them between
1 a.m. and 2 a.m. — the same hour during
which they initially gave out the free
Breathalyzers. Breathalyzer venders will
receive a commission, based on the num-
ber of Breathalyzers they can sell in a
night.

‘This program gives an opportunity
to get young people involved, and to
make some good money, all while in col-
lege,” Laboon said.

Laboon is currently working with
various companies, including the Erie
Insurance Agency, to sell and promote the
Breathalyzers.

Local radio station WBZZ 93.7, also
known as B94, has helped the Save a
Buddy Campaign by giving out sample
Breathalyzers to listeners. Families have
also gotten involved with the program,
some giving $1,000 donations to support

' the group.

Though Laboon still works in Web
design, he said the Save a Buddy
Campaign has also become a full-time
job. He said he spent countless hours
working on the project during the past
month and a half, even forwarding calls
for the campaign to his personal cell
phone after 5 p.m.

Individuals and companies can pur-
chase the Breathalyzer key chains or tester
reﬁlls on Laboon’s Web site at www.save-
abuddy.com.

When selling the Breathalyzers on
the Web, the organization charges the
lowest prices, offering a key chain with
three testers for $9.99, according to the
site. The retail price is $13.99. '

giving.”

Martin also described monetary com-
pensation for cadavers’ organs as a slippery
slope. Once the families of deceased organ
donors are awarded money, there will be
pressure for living donors to also be paid, she
said. If living donors are paid for their con-
tribution, some people donate organs merely
for the money, disregarding health risks.

If uials involving monetary compensa-
tion actually take place, the National Kidney

Foundation wants to be involved in the plan- ‘

ning and testing, Martin said. Even if the hi-
als successfully increase the organ supply,
however, Martin said she doubts the founda-

 

tion will change its stance.

Not all national organizations are com-
pletely opposed to the idea of monetary
compensation for organs. The American
Medical Association supports a trial run of
the plan to determine its eifectiveness. In a

prepared statement delivered at a June 3 con-

gressional hearing, Dr. Robert Sade, a mem-
ber of the Ad Hoc committee and one of the
AMA’s 24003-2004 members of the Council
on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, gave the
AMA’s opinion on the issue.

“We have noted that ﬁnancial ‘incen-
tives might be an important motivational
factor-in the context of cadaveric organ
donation, but that it remains inadequately
explored because‘ of federal prohibition,”

Sade said. “In our view, such incentives are
not intrinsically unethical, even though they
are counter to current customs, and, if
proven eﬁective, could save the lives of
many patients suffering from end-stage
organ failure.”

Dr. Kyriazi later addressed those who
question the ethics and future implications of
this plan.

“It’s not a payment for organs. It’s a
standard thank—you gift for the life-giving act
of donating — for community service,” he
said “Americans have long been perfectly
comfortable with death beneﬁts being
oifered, for example, to families of service-
men who die in the line of duty. This is no
diﬂerent.”

Cutting trash services affects students, city

Pittsburgh is about to getydirtyj It’s
about to have its streets unswept, its
trash bins unemptied and its rodents un-
controlled.

Years ago, when the steel industry
controlled it, Pittsburgh’. was called the
Smoky City, a reference to the air that
blackened most buildings. _

The city’s recent budget cuts —
which clipped police patrol and public
transportation — have now turned to
address trash collection, pest control and
graffiti removal. Perhaps Pittsburgh
wants to assume the moniker of Dirty
City.

According to yesterday’s Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, “the city will stop collect-
ing garbage for the housing authority,
parochial schools  [and] reduce bulk
collection and street sweeping.” This
laundry list of cut services to come was
announced by the Public Works Director
to the City Council. ' .

Because of budget constraints, it
seems the city cannot afford to make its
streets hygienic and livable.

Pitt students, particularly those liv-
ing in South Oakland, know that’ garbage
piles mean rodents, roaches and other
blights, including the lovely stench of
refuse in the morning. Trash removal is
not a matter of public service; it’s one of
public safety.

These budget cuts will affect those
living in apartments larger than six units
-—— including public housing buildings,

where more than 45,000 families live. In
Oakland, apartment buildings will have
to arrange for private contractors to
remove trash, which will probably lead
to higher utility fees. 4' ,

Pittsburgh is already having prob-
lems attracting and retaining its resi-
dents. Cuttingibasic services like trash
removal, buses and police enforcement
will not remedy this problem. Who
wants to live in a dirty, dangerous city
where you can’t go anywhere after 9
pm?

Of course, with service cuts come
layoffs. The Post—Gazette reported that
the Public Works Director has 24 percent
of his original workforce. It also stated
that the city laid off 731 workers, to
compensate for budgeting problems.

Who wants to live in a dirty, danger-
ous, jobless city? Certainly not freshly
minted college graduates who already
experienced the effects of these changes.

Pittsburgh spent 50 years trying to
change its image. Its stone buildings are
no longer black, its rivers are cleaner and
its population is less prone to changing
their shirts at lunch — a common prac-
tice before cleaner air standards were
enacted.

Despite these criticisms, there is lit-
tle that can be done. Things, as the say-
ing goes, are bad all over. But, unless
city services are reinstated, Pittsburgh is

headed toward bad times and the bad 5

nicknames that accompany them.

Facing graduation: one year counting

Embarking on my senior year, I think
back to the ﬁngering memories of my fresh-
man one: the ﬁrst day of classes, the ﬁrst
football game of the season and late-night
run—ir1s with Pitt’s ﬁne police force.

Now, in ‘my ﬁnal stretch as a Pitt stu-
dent, I ﬁnd myself back at my parents’
Shaler home. After a party-ﬁlled year of liv-
ing in our run-down, Tiny 'I'im—sized apart-

wondering about my “Prince Charming” -
what happened to happily ever after, any-
way?

I’ve realized that, despite all that has

changed in the last four years, much has
stayed the same. All through college, I was
always looking forward to the end of class,
the upcoming weekend, running into the
cutie I met at the party the weekend before.
Regardless of what it was, I
always seemed to be wishing
the time away.

I honestly think I’ve met
more people in the last four
years of college than I have my
entire life prior to that. I’ve
made best friends, lasting rela-
tionships and future contacts,

Having a lighterclass load this semes— ‘

ter, I aimlessly wander around campus,
using my free time to lie on the Cathedral
lawn under a shady tree, or watch the sun set
from the 35th ﬂoor of the Cathedral — some
of my favorite pastimes as a freshman.

Yet, back then, I was faced with the con-
cept of doing nothing but daydreaming
about that night’s party or under-21 bar-hop-
ping adventure, along with going to a few
classes here and there. ,

The biggest problems I faced freshman
year were walking home from a late-night
party at the “crackhouse” on Frazer Street,
not being able to open my door — and learn-
ing that I could jump into my apartment win-
dow by moving my fan out of the way —

' and relocating my lost purse and cell phone

know I shouldn’t be getting sentimental until

the end of the year, but I guess it’s the begin- .

ning of an ending, in a way.
Life in college is how it always should
- be: some work, lots of play, quality time with
friends at every given chance, JC’s 100
Beers Cult at Fuel and Fuddle, late nights at
Curnpie’s, long walks in the park, sunsets at
Wasliington’s Landing, and second-chance
meetings on Fifth Avenue to make things as

Off The Wire: Commandments controversy displays lack of objectivity

By Christopher Harrop
(U-WIRE) MANHATTAN,
Kan., Religion is on the
defensive again, and its
defenders are mobilized
against a perceived threat in
the Deep South.

Alabama Chief Justice
Roy Moore stuck true to his
faith and ignored the law by
refusing to remove a monu-
ment dedicated to the Ten
Commandments from state
grounds. Defying a federal
court order, Moore was sus-
pended from his bench and
faces further inquiries.

Needless to say, Moore is
now the hero of the day for
the Fox News crowd. At
courthouse rallies, Mooreis
given rock star treatment for
his stubborn stance.

Ayesha Khan, an attor-
ney for Americans United for
Separation of Church and
State, told CNN Moore is
determinedlto “proclaim the
sovereignty of the Christian
God.”

Some have compared

him to Martin Luther King
Jr., in this respect. Touse the
term very loosely, ‘many are
hailing Moore as a martyr of
Christiandom. ‘
Justice Moore unques-
tionably is a firm believer in
his faith, but his conviction
to the Constitution is ques-
tionable, as any judge wor-

thy of a robe should not be a

confused by the two standing
legal traditions established

' in the First Amendment to

the Constitution.

This is where the debate
on religion hinges today in
America’. '

_ There is growing senti-
ment across the United
States for religion to play a
greater part in our daily
lives. Most cite the large role
religion played in education
until the latter 20th century.

A return to the “good ole
days” of God—fearing, disci-
plined young urchins will
turn around our failing
schools, invigorate the work
force and stimulate society

 

   

—— or so they say.

The only thing standing
in the way is that pesky little
Constitution, which guaran-

tees free exercise of religion

while barring the govern-

citizenship.

ment from promoting an
establishment of religion.

' It allows citizens to prac-
tice their faiths without
interference. It allows the
people to be.free from a
state-sanctioned
whether it comes in the form
of teacher—led prayer in
-school or a singlet state
church. ’

Say what you will about
the Christian teachings
underpinning our society and

theology,-

values. No declaration» of
faith is necessary to enjoy.
American citizenship, except
the Pledge of Allegiance;
also supposedly under attack
by activist liberal judges.
The amount of religion

, people want is being deter-

mined these days. Private
prayer among individuals at
public events — especially
high school graduations — is
perfectly fine, but telling
someone it is forbidden to
use the PA system to broad-
cast the prayer raises the ire
of untold hordes of Christian
groups.

Religious acceptance is
no longer the focal point in
this issue. For most main-
stream Americans, harboring
the hateful grip of religious
intolerance is a thing of the
past.

While White America
obviously has not come to
fully understand other reli-
gions (Islam in particular),
progress is being made that
can be seen on local levels.

The desire to publicly

proclaim the word of God is ’

a tempting one for many
Christians who wish to
spread their faith.

I only ask that they
remember Matthew 6:6,
which says, “Butthou, when
thou prayest, enter into thy
closet, and when thou hast
shut thy door, pray to thy
Father which is in secret; and
thy Father which seeth in
secret shall reward thee
openly.”

There is no war being
fought against Christianity
today in America.

Faith and the church are
very much alive and well in
the United States, but monu-
ments like that in Alabama
or institutions like school
prayer are unnecessary and
best left to be constructed by

' private interests.

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

Reﬂectionson a
“street performer”  

Walking around
a. local Borders
bookstore. Tuesday
afternoon, a piece
of conversation »
between a manager a O
and an employee of
the store caught my
ear. ‘ .

The subject was
the passing of 
Wesley Willis, the i '
Chicago-based
musician who  
released over 50
albums and wrote
songs with titles
like “Birdman Kicked My Ass,”
“Arnold Schwarzenegger” and “Cut
the Mullet,”. The manager, who was
the older of the two, seemed a bit clue-
less as to who Willis was and asked
the younger, hipper, more in-the—know
employee to explain. The hipster, with
a hint of pandering to Willis in his
voice, stated that Willis wasn’t so
much a musician as he was a street
performer who happened to get some
notoriety due to his eccentricity.

For anyone not familiar with
Wesley Willis, he was a schizophrenic
musician in Chicago who put out sim-
plistic, minute—and—a—half to three-
minute songs. about people:“Al
Capone;” places: “Rock and Roll
‘McDonald’s;” and events: “I Broke

Out Your Windshield.” He also ended.

every song with, “Rock over London!
Rock over Chicago!” and then a ‘cor-
porate slogan, like “Diet Pepsi. Uh
huh.” ,
So you can see how someone
would call Willis eccentric. A
Granted, Willis isn’t exactly Top
40 radio fare. You can’t really put a
song on the radio called ‘.‘Al Capone,”

, with lyrics like “Al Capone was a

hoodlum/He was a gangster/He killed
people in gangland style/He is a stupid
asshole/He is full of shit,” and expect
it to be listened to by the masses, let

, alone placed in heavy rotation.

And therein lies the big problem
with what the Borders employee was
saying in questioning Willis’ credibil-
ity as .a musician. T

Does Willis’ beginning as a street

performer and his .le‘ss-than-r.adio_— 3 .;  . ,

friendly work war-
rant a belittling of
his musical accom-
plishments? If it
does, then Birdman
can come kick my
ass.

C e r t a i n 1 y ,
Willis started as a
street performer, but
he wrote enough
songs, simplistic in
lyrics and beats as
they might be, to ﬁll
over 50 albums, and
has become popular
enough to have not
one but three greatest hits albums
released. Most musicians are lucky to
have one hits package, let alone two or
three — Willis is entering James
Taylor and Bob Dylan territory here.

If you look at some of the “bands”
and “acts” who are passed off on an
unsuspecting public as musicians,
you’ll find groups like the Backstreet
Boys and *NSYNC and acts like
Britney Spears and, let’s’ go back a
ways, Tiffany — all started in outlets
more like A carnivals rather than
through paying their dues in seedy
dive*bars. Spears and some of the
members of the two .aforementioned
groups got their starts on the “Mickey
Mouse Club,” while Tiffany inaugu-
rated her career playing in the malls of
Suburbia, USA. _

It would seem to me that Willis
earned his street cred in every possible
sense of the term. Sure, he was a street
performer — he performed on the
streets of Chicago -— but at least he
earned his notoriety through word of
mouth and cultish reputation, unlike
the teenybopper musical geniuses who
were pimped out by Disney and MTV.
His music is catchy, fun and wholly
original. And let’s not forget that
Willis wrote his own songs and played
his own instrument, which is much
more than can be said for so many
other “legit” acts out there.

Of course, the Borders employee
likely wasn’t considering Britney and
Backstreet when he made his state-
ment, brushing Willis off as someone

Mutant Mindframe
Big Gipp

Koch Entertainment
<.“ni‘n’?r

Part ﬁm, part political and all smooth
rhymes, Big Gipp’s solo debut rap album
Mutant Mindframe proves — just as a
variety of other artists do — that rap music
doesn’t have to be exclusively about
money and naked women to be worthy of
an audience. »

Big Gipp is a member of the rap
group Goodie Mob and part of the
Atlanta-based, rap artist collective called
Dungeon Family, which includes Outkast.
He has now pulled together an impressive
solo album that incorporates his southern
roots and the social issues that have affect-
ed him personally.

The tracks on this album are diverse
in subject and in the variety of beats that
accompany the words. Some songs, such
asf‘Steppin Out” are purely for fun, with a
dance beat appropriate for clubs and lyrics
about being a “player.” The song
“Strange” has a ‘70s funk beat that works
well, as Big Gipp talks about partying. “3
Wordz” tackles a typical rap subject: love
and the gangsta lifestyle. Big Gipp does
not stray from the standards of the genre.
Instead, he expands on them and gives

A '  >1 .3:

at  5£:;t.  5..-.;. .5 

.1-

-«.4

..~.<"-"' . .

. . n O I
these. tired topics some originality. In
“Let’s Fight,” Big Gipp doesn’t rap about
ﬁghting others, but about ﬁghting against
issues such"as rising  and corruption
among political leaders. '

Even when Big Gipp’s songs turn
more serious, there is no superﬂuous
preaching. He simply speaks his mind,
keeping the same beats and clever rhymes
that make his less poignant songs enter-
taining and energetic. The moving song
“Creeks” serves as a different kind of
memorial for Atlanta’s missing and mur-
dered children. “These Times” aclmowl-
edges the struggles that many black peo-
ple face in America, and Big Gipp offers
his own solutions to these problems. No
matter the kind of song he’s performing,
Big Gipp never loses the unique style that
makes him worth listening to.

iMutant Mindframe is not the typical
rap CD, but it won’t alienate hardcore and
casual hip-hop fans. Big Gipp only
enhances the more enjoyable parts of rap
music and uses these features to highlight

his thoughtful words. There is plenty of .

variety in his record, and each change
works in Big Gipp’s favor. For those rap
fans looking for something new, or any-
one who’s curious, Mutant Mindframe is a
CD that shouldn’t be overlooked.

not worth the effort. But Why the ‘hate?
Willis didn’t hate that Borders
employee. He didn’t hate anyone, with
the exception of those with mullets --
“Why don’t you cut that mullet,
numbskull!” — and,Al Capone. But
Willis loved music and turned a lot of
other people on to a different style of
music, one that they otherwise‘wou1d-
n’t hear on theradio.

At the end of “Harmony Joy Bus
Ride,” after exclaiming that he acci-
dentally bit his tongue, Willis talks
about his love of music, “I just love to
play rock ‘n’ roll. I love to write songs
all the time about what’s up on these
streets. I write songs about people get-

ting killed. I write songs about people
getting beaten up. I wrote songs about
people getting taken to jail by the
police. And I also write songs about
love and happiness.”

' Love and happinesslwere two-

principles good enough for someone
like John Lennon, not exactly a musi-
cal lightweight, and -they should be
good enough for every true music fan
out there. Wesley Willis wasn’t the
most talented musician ever, but he
made music in a way that no one else

did and put forth the effort to rock the

asses off of every single audience for
which he performed. For that he
should be saluted. ‘

Coming into camp this August, the Pitt footballteam

" boasts one of the strongest offenses in the Big East, and the

country. ‘With keyplayers returning at every position, the
Panthers will take the ﬁeld with a potent, balanced and

' downright scary offensive attack.

’ “We got a nice blend; we canedo both [run and pass],”

offensive coordinator JD. Brookhart said. “We just got a

few guys to replace, but our diversity is exciting.”

Quarterback   A - -

For the ﬁrst time in recent‘ memory, the Panthers have a
returning, undisputed starting quarterback Redshirt senior
Rod Rutherford has been steadily improving, and has helped
turned Pitt into the offensive juggernaut it has become.

' “After the [Texas] A&M game, [Rutherford] really took
control of this offense and made it his. The offensive
momentum started to grow from there,” Brookhart said.

With the multitalented Rutherford behind center, oppos-
ing defenses must be ready for anything.

“He does it all; he’s an imposing player,” Brookhart

added.
Behind Rutherford on the depth chart are two local

. products; West Allegheny’s Tyler Palko and Steel Valley’s

ﬁdence in the rtmning game, the Panthers ﬁnally have bal-

, to get some touches this year, as well as sophomore Jawan

Returning players look to power offense

Running back

A consistent running back is hard to ﬁnd, yet when the
Panthers found one, they hesitated in narriing him the starter
until they were sure. Brandon Miree’s conﬁrmation came
during the Panthers’ upset of ﬂien-No.3 ranked Virginia
Tech, in which he rushed for 161 yards and the winning
touchdown. 1 '

The game sparked Miree, as well as the rushing offense

for the Panthers. Since then, the nmning attack has done

_ Pitt lost two players to the NFL draft -———
linebacker Gerald Hayes and cornerback
Torrie Cox —from a defensive unit that ﬁn-

ished No. 12 in the nation in total defense

last season. But Pitt’s defensive unit looks to
enjoy similar success in 2003, as -it returns
six starters from last year’s squad.

“[The hype] is very ﬂattering,” Harriott

Lee, Abdul lead special teams

RYAN FALOON
Staff Writer

There’s something extra-special about
this year’s special teams unit.

Returning ﬁve specialists, including
both punter and kicker, the Panthers special
teams combine to bring experience and skill
to the table. y '

. i As a unit, they are capable of dominat-
ing the Big East, with the speed to retum
kicks, the power to kick ﬁeld goals ‘of 50-
plus yards and the talent to pin their oppo-
nents inside the 20-yard line on punting situ-
ations. — ‘

Receiving rankings as high as No. 2 in
the nation — by The Sporting News — the
Pitt special teams are on everyone’s watch
list, both in and out of its conference.

Pittwillfareaswellasanyteaminthe
nation in punting, because senior punter
AndyLeeret11ms forhisﬁnal season.

Lee, a preseason All-American, put
together a remarkable season last year, aver-
aging 43.1 yards per punt and earning recog-

‘ Iiition as Big East Special Teams Co-Player

of the Year. His work ethic pushed him to
work on particular areas of his game during
the surmner and he hopes to bring back an

» even stronger leg.

VV1th a goal of leading the nation in net
punting for his senior season, Lee not only
worked on his power, but his directional
punting as well.

“[P1mting] is a big part of the game,”
Lee said “If you put one inside the 20, it
really helps the defense out. I worked on

directional punting so we can have less
retum.”

In addition to their punting, the kicking
division of the Panthers special teams will
most likely produce another dominant year.
Coming back after a remarkable freshman
season, plaoe—kicker David Abdul is back
and expected to be a Valuable asset

Abdul was the second-leading scorer.

for the Panthers last season, with 67 points,
receiving national recognition in his ﬁrst sea-

.son. A threat to his opponents from nearly
anywhere inside the 30-yard line, Abdul has
the capability of being the deciding factor in
the ﬁnal minutes of a close Big East
matchup. .

“It is a huge beneﬁt to our team to have
this kind of experience in our kicking game,”
special teams coach Bryan Deal said “We
loved the way David ﬁnished his freshman
year and it will be exciting to see him elevate

‘his game to yet another level this season.”

The Panthers show depth in returning

, punts and kickoffs,“ as well. Experienced

seniors Yogi Roth and William Ferguson, as
well as junior Marcus Furman, are compet-
ing for starting punt-returning responsibili-
ties. Fuiman and senior Shawntae Spencer
will most likely sit deep to return the kick-
offs. ’

Experience is key in returning punts and

I kicks, and that’s exactly what the Panthers

will have this season. p

The Panthers have one of the top groups
of specialists in the nation, one that could
win football games for the team this season
and take them into the postseason.

In addition to Wilson, the Panthers will
try to rim several two-tight end sets using
junior Erik Gill. _

spring board into recognition.

Panther offense has new starters at wide receiver, center and right guard

Offense, page 12
tight end. I

Wide receiver

Of the two open starting spots, one is the receiver play-
ing opposite of Lany Fitzgerald. '

Fitzgerald, of course, is the All—American wideout who
became the first freshman to be unanimously named to the
Big East first team.

The question in this talented — but yet untested —
group is: ,Who will step up and become the starter? At this
time nothing is certain — nor is Fitzgerald’s status after a
hamstring injury duringvcamp — but there are several can-
didates that are looking to contribute.

Currently, the favorites to start are seniors Princell
Brockenbrough and Chris Curd. Brockenbrough is a junior
college transfer who missed last season because of a knee

injury, but the coaches like his size at 6-3, 205 pounds.
Curd is a former tight end and safety who seems to do

everything the coaches ask of him. Curd has slimmed down

since the spring, trimming his large body to 6-3, 220 pounds.
Senior Yogi Roth, at 5-10, 195 pounds, brings excellent
route nrnning and great hands to the ﬁeld. Those attributes,
along with his knowledge of the offense, should allow him
to get on the ﬁeld, even if he does not win the starting job.
Speedster Joe Stephens is also in the nmning, at 6-0,
190 pounds. Stephens has speed and some experience, but
could bring more big play potential to an already dangerous
offense. Regardless of who wins the starting job, all four of

, these guys will play.

“All guys have their strength, and all guys are showing
signs of making progress, just no one’s there yet,” Brookhart
said.

Offensive line

No matter what kind of skill, players and playmakers
the Panthers have, nothing will matter unless the offensive
line is consistent. Last season there were times when nmning
the ball was impossible. V

On the other hand, there were games when it seemed
easy, like Virginia Tech. “With three starters returning, this
could be the best line the Panthers have had in years.

Returning to start are the anchors at tackle, senior Matt
Morgan and junior Rob Petitti. Joining Petitti and Morgan
are left guard Dan LaCarte, who started last season, and
senior Jon Schall. Schall has been the talk of the camp and
has won one starting offensive line spot. Which spot he won
will be determined by how other players fare.

Currently, Justin Belarski and Rob Fredrick are both
competing for the starting center position. If neither player
can distinguish himself ﬁ'om'the other, then Schall will be
the starting center, and sophomore John Simonitis will
become the starting right guard. '

ered in tandem this year, but the leading can-
didate for starter at the moment is sopho-

regular-season debut for the Panthers as a
starter against Kent State next weekend.
Bennett, who is .a native of Delanco, N.J.,
played tackle in high school, but at six feet,
230 pounds, moved to linebacker when he
was recruited by Pitt.

Pressing Bennett hard as a backup will
be freshman H.B. Blades, who was irnpres—

defensive backﬁeld this season.

Both strong safety Tyrone ‘Gilliard and
free safety Tez Morris retum as second—year
starters.

Gilliard, a ﬁve-foot—eleven—inch, 195-
pound junior, had 49 tackles and six passes
defended in his ﬁrst year as a starter. The
ﬁve-foot—ten—inch, 190-pound Morris, also a
junior, was all over the ﬁeld as a run stopper
last season, accumulating 119 tackles to ﬁn-

 



 
    

.

     
   

The comerback position, however, is
another story. With the exodus of Cox, Pitt’s
most experienced comerback is undoubted-
ly Shawntae Spencer. The six—foot-two-inch
senior has been an on—again, off—again
starter over the past two seasons, but is the

Panthers’ established starter on the left side V

this year. His 11 passes defended and three
picks led the team last season.
The right side of the ﬁeld will be cov-

more Bernard Lay.

Lay saw limited action last season, and
senior William Ferguson, who was the
favorite to start in the spring, may have lost
the job in the wake of Lay’s impressive

camp. Ferguson had 33 tackles and a sack _

last year, and has started eight career games.
In order for the Panthers secondary to be
successful in 2003, Lay and Ferguson will
have to learn quickly on the job.
