SGB selects new members in private

John Manganaro  Katherine Sandler
‘ News Staff

, Pitt’s Student Government Board took more
thanan hour to pick two new members
after interviewing eight applicants during
a public meeting last night. i

In a private vote, the Board selected
two of its current committee members,

_ John Hasley and Kieran O’Leary, to serve

as interim Board members before the full

election takes place in November.
Hasley, a junior history and market-

ing major, currently serves on the Board’s

government relations committee. O’Leary
serves as the public relations chair.

Both new_members will be sworn in at
next week’s SGB meeting, and both will be
able to run for re—election as long as they
stillfulﬁll thqeligibility‘requirements.

Neither appointee was immediately
available for comment last night.

Immediately after the meeting, ambigu-
ity loomed over the eligibility of a fresh-
man applicant. According to SGB by-laws,
applicants for openpositions must be in
good standing with the University, have a
QPA of 2.5 and be a full-time non-College
of General Studies major with at least one

year left at the University. .

Before the meeting, Shull said one of
the eight applicants, freshman Pooja Pa-
tel, was ineligible because she does not
have a QPA. ' ' .

But at the meeting, Patel said she meet
the eligibly requirements because she took
a college-level biology_ course in high school
and was able to transfer her credits to Pitt,
giving her a 3.9 QPA.

Shull said that Patel did not earn enough
votes, leaving the question of her eligibil-

City sued
for (5-20  
arrests

Staff Report

Eleven current and former Pitt students
ﬁled a lawsuit against the city of Pittsburgh
and 17 city police officers Tuesday morn-
ing, saying their First, Fourth and 14th
Amendment rights were violated when they
were arrested in connection to last year’s
G-20 Summit.

The lawsuit, ﬁled in federal court with
14 other people also represented by the

local chapter of the American Civil Liber— ‘

ties Union, says police denied the students
their right to peacefully demonstrate and
that ofﬁcers used “excessive force” while
arresting them. A S

. The outcome of the lawsuit might inﬂu-
ence G-20 cases that are still in court, but
will likely have little effect on the dozens
of Pitt students whose G-20' court cases
have already been closed, said David Har-
ris, a Pitt law professor and ACLU board
member.

Police arrested 188 people in the days
surrounding the Summit. At the time, Pitt
police Chief Tim Delaney estimated that
about a quarter of them were Pitt stu-
dents. ' . ’ _

The students and other plaintiffs list-
ed on yesterday’s lawsuit asked the U.S.
District Court of Western Pennsylvania to
grant them money and declare that their
rights were violated.

They also asked the court to declare the
state failure to dispersestatute unconsti-

Protests over military policy

The Rainbow Alliance holds protest challenging“don’t ask don’t tell.”

Mallory Grossman
Staﬁ’ Writer

The Rainbow Alliance held a silent
protest on Tuesday challenging
the military’s controversial “don’t
ask don’t tell” policy, the same day
the U.S. Senate blocked debate on
legislation that could provide a
vehicle for repealing the policy.

Senate Republicans voted

unanimously to block debate on
the defense-spending bill after
Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid said he would attach a num-
ber of the Democrats’ election-
year priorities, including “don’t
ask don’t tell,” while also moving
to limit the amendments offered
by Republicans, according to the
New York Times.

The proposition to repeal the
controversial law, which pro-
hibits openly gay, lesbian or bi-
sexual people from serving in the
military, will likely come up again
following the November midterm
elections. '

Here. at Pitt, members of Pitt’s
Rainbow Alliance chapter pro-
tested outside the Cathedral of
Learning throughout the morning
and afternoon. The group, which
promotes the interests and con-
cerns of the gay, lesbian, bisexual,
transgendered, queer and allied
community,joined a host of other
organizations across the country
seeking to end what they are call-
ing unlawful discharges from the
military. , V

James Weaver, Pitt Rainbow
Alliance president, said his orga-
nization was protesting to raise
awareness about the vote. a

Following the Senate vote,
Weaver said many of the protest-

ers were disappointed, but he still
viewed the event as a success.

“We really just wanted to raise
awareness, and I think we accom-
plished that goal,” Weaver said.
“We had a number of people from
outside Rainbow Alliance join the
protest.” ~ A

Weaver acknowledged that it is
often diﬂicult to pass controversial
legislation so close toan election,
and he said that his organization
plans to stay involved with the
“don’t ask don’t tell” debate.

In a news release from the na-
tional advocacy group GetEQUA_L,
spokesman Brad Luna expressed
frustration over the Senate’s de-
cision.

“We are outraged after watch-
ing our right to serve openly in the
military be volleyed back and forth
like a political football while our
community has done all we pos-
sibly can to secure our dignity,”
Luna said.

In the release, Luna said
GetEQUAL is circulating an online
petition calling President Obama
to issue an executive order “to
unequivocally state that [sexually

based] military discharges must -

end immediately.” _

Currently, the “don’t ask don’t
tell” policy mandates the dis-
charge of openly gay, lesbian or
bisexual service members, accord-
ing to the Service Members Legal
Defense Network website. A repeal
of the law would allow openly gay
and lesbian individuals to serve in
the military.

Ofﬁcials from Pitt’s ROTC and,

in the Oakland Army recruiting

_ office were not available for com-

ment on the legislation or the si-
lent protest Tuesday.

Rainbow Alliance Vice Presi-
dent Dylan Drobish said the
group’s demonstration was si-
lent to symbolize the silence that
soldiers must keep while serving
their country.

“These soldiers signed up to
protect the freedoms that Ameri-
cans have, yet they are denied their
basic freedoms,” Drobish said.

Drobish, a senior, is gay and
once had a dream of being in the
Air Force and serving his coun-
try.

“I slowly realized I couldn’t live

that way and not be true to who I
am,” he said.
I Weaver said he hopes the re-
peal of “don’t ask, don’t'tell” will
allow service members to serve
openly, regardless of their sexual
orientation.

The scene at Pitt was repeated
all over the country this week, and
even Lady Gaga got involved in the
protests. The pop diva held a rally
in Portland, Maine, on Monday
to put pressure on lawmakers to
support the repeal. 4

She called “don’t ask don’t tell”

“wrong, unjust and backward”

during a rally to repeal the policy
in Maine on Monday .
- Chance Thomas, a member

of the Rainbow Alliance who at-

tended thelprotest, was a mem-
ber of the Navy for more than ﬁve
years. Having fought in Iraq and
Afghanistan, Thomas said he has
had a difﬁcult history with the
military’s policy. L
“When you’re fighting with
people, it doesn’t matter where
you grew up, or what color you
are,” Thomas said. “Most soldiers,
while in the midst of battle, could
care less if someone is gay.” I ,

Pitt students,     
ACLU file   lawsuit

Lawsuit 4 1

tutional, saying it is “vague and ‘

overbroad.’’
The current statute allows po-

A lice to order a crowd to disperse

if three people. in that crowd are
charged with disorderly con-
duct. The ACLU said in the suit,
“There was not ﬁghting, boister-
ous drunkenness, vandalism, or
disorderly conduct, and prior to
issuing the order to disperse, po-
lice had arrested no one.”

The lawsuit says thatpolice vi-
olated protestors’ rights because
they “funneled everyone onto the
lawn of the University of Pitts-
burgh’s Cathedral of Learning.
Police then surrounded the ap-
proximately 100 people trapped
on the Lawn, refused to allow
them to leave, ordered them to
lie on the ground and placed them
in handcuffs.”

It also says that some ofﬁcers
made “sexually suggestive com-
ments” to some female arrestees
and refused to allow one man to
take his diabetes medication, until
a nurse atthe correctional institu-
tion gave him some. ‘

City Solicitor Dan Regan con-

ﬁrmed that the city of Pittsburgh‘

received a copy of the suit Tuesday
morning. He said the law depart-
ment is currently reviewing the
lawsuit, but could not comment

» further. Regan did not know when

further comment would be avail-
able. City police referred ques-
tions to Regan’s department, and
a spokeswoman for Mayor Luke
Ravenstahl did not respond to
requests for comment. .

Among the Pitt-affiliated plain-
tiffs isjordan Romanus, who was

a senior studying philosophy.and

_ political science ‘at the time of the

Summit.

“I just want the city to admit
that their logic in bringing such
a chaotic event to the city was
faulty,” Romanus said in an in-

. terview.

' Romanus had charges of disor-
derly conduct and failure ‘to dis-
perse withdrawn and was found
not guilty of hazardous disorderly
conduct/physical offense.

All of the plaintiffs involved
had their G—20-related charges
either withdrawn or dismissed, or
they were found not guilty.

Sara Rose, an attorney for the
ACLU, said this suit has been in
the works for months. Many of
the plaintiffs contacted the ACLU
soon after their ‘arrests, and the
ACLU sent out volunteers to col-
lect information from people who

~ claimed to be subjected to police

misconduct, she said.

It wasn’t until this summer that
Rose was able to process the infor-
mation. When she did, she asked

those involved if they wanted to I

be a part of the lawsuit.
If the suit is successful, a jury

' will decide how much money each

plaintiff will receive, she said.

It is unclear how the suit could
affect police conduct. In order for
plaintiffs to ﬁle an injunctive relief
— which would order the defen-
dants to cease a speciﬁc behav-
ior —. the plaintiffs have to show
that they’re going to be a victim
again, Rose said. That would be
hard to prove in this case, given
that the G—20 Summit was a one-
time event, she said.ﬂ

State Secretary of Health Everette James will_
step down from his position Oct _1. to become
Pitt’s ﬁrst associate vice chancellor for health
policy and planning.

In addition to offering advice onlegal is-
sues surrounding health reform, James will
also serve as a professor of health policy and
management in Pitt’s Graduate School of Public
Health. James’ role in the school will include
teaching, advising and researching topics
related to health policy, according to a news
release from UPMC. I ‘
“EveretteJames brings a deep understand-
ing of health policy and plamiing and will play
an instrumental role in furthering our rela-

health policy groups,” Arthur S. Levine, senior‘
vice chancellor for the health sciences and dean
of the School of Medicine at Pitt,- said in the
release. ‘ J V . ' 0
James has served as secretary of health for
two years, regulating hospitals, nursing homes
and managing care programs throughout the
state. During his time in office, the department
has implemented a statewide smoking ban and
“instituted the most comprehensive program
in the nation to eliminate healthcare-acquired
infections,” according to Rendell’s office.
James received a bachelor’s degree from the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a
law degree and master’s of business admin-
istration, both from the Illinois Institute of
Technology. '
Governor_Ed Rendell said in a news release
yesterday, “I am delighted that Everette [James]
is joining the University of Pittsburgh, where
he will be working to advance health research
and delivery in one of the anation.” _ .
Rendell will ‘appoint an acting secretary of

head-on yet because we decided that in
either case Pooja does not yet have the nec-

Patel said she would still try to join the

During the meeting, the Board inter—
viewed the applicants as a group, asking
questions about the allocations process, as
well as general questions about Pitt.

Many of the allocation-based questions
went unanswered by the applicants, but
Shull said he expected the candidates to
have difficulty. . J

The Board also approved changes to the
election code last night. During this year’s

_ election, candidates will be allowed to start

their paper campaigns two days earlier —
ﬁve days before students hit the polls.

Students will also be allowed to cast nine
votes during this year’s election — eight
votes for Board members and one for Board
president. That’s three more votes than al-
lowed in previous elections.

Candidates must alsomake the Board

EDITORIAL

Steel dresses anyone?

When asked to judge Pittsburgh’s most A

deﬁning attributes, the vi/"orld conjures up
a common image.

In reaching a decision, the people of
the world laud our success on the football
ﬁeld, they for some reason still think that
smoke from the “steel mills” envelops our
buildings, and they honor our mystical
ability to somehow survive the depressing
weather with enough cheer to grant us ex-
clusive access to “Mister Rogers’ Neighbor-
hood.” Although Mr. Rogers’ iconic mus-
tard sweater seems to have interviewed
well with that esteemed international
panel which decides these notable attri-
butes of U.S. cities, Pittsburgh’s fashion
style consistently misses its appointment.
In Far Far Away Land, when you think Pitts-
burgh, you think Catholic and blue collar,
notjimmy Choo and Oxford shirts.

Well, if our calculations are correct,
the fashionistas among us might no lon-
ger have to strain their necks looking to
emulate style trends in New York or Los
Angeles. It’s time to don your Marcjacobs
and get pumped — patent leather ones,
that is -—— Steel City’s having afashion
week! Now it’s time for the Big Apple to
roll over already.

According to the Pittsburgh Post-Ga-
zette, more than 50 designers and retail-
ers — and more than 200 models — will
strut around the city next week as part of
the first annual Pittsburgh Fashion Week.
Venues to be strutted upon include the
Heinz History Center, Southside Works
and the Ramada Hotel and Conference
Center.

The event will commence Monday night
with a runway show entitled .“Clearing for
Takeoff — Destination, Fashion Oz!” in

In between, fashion—goers can delight in

The PittNews

an exuberant variety of shows and vendor
fairs. _ . I

Aside from putting on a show devoted
to the international fashion designer Zang
Toi, the event’s organizers will focus much
of the schedule on local talent — in August
they launched a model search at The Mall
at Robinson, just outside Pittsburgh.

What makes Pittsburgh Fashion Week
so important for this city really has noth-
ing to do with fashion, at least in speciﬁc.
Don’t get the wrong idea —i The Pitt News
holds enormous respect for people who re-
spect the way they look. It’s just that what
we believe Pittsburgh will take from this,
especially if it comes back in the future, is
more than just a photo op, a boost in retail
sales and an excuse to wear Gucci.

If you look a bit deeper, the event rep-
resents anothersigniﬁcant step on Pitts-
burgh’s road toward greater sophistication
as a cultural center and toward greater in-
ﬂuence on the country as a whole. However
reluctant the world might be to change its
collective image of Pittsburgh, the event

‘ gives us one more reason to View that im-

age as outdated and incomplete.

Especially when you consider recent
developments — like innovation—friendly
Google opening up shop around the corner
and our workforce being found among the
highest educated — this town is headed
for greatness, the face of which we haven’t
ever known  just disregard the fact that
we need a Connecticut investment ﬁrm to
adequately ﬁnance our budget.

Maybe some day soon we’ll no longer be
talking about students who come to Pitt,
graduate and then high tail it out of here
for cities that are more en vogue.

‘ So go participate in Fashion Week; ex-
perience a taste of what’s to come. Friday
and Saturday shows are only $5 for stu-
dents, anyway. | ‘

LETTER TO EDITOR
Dear Editor,

In the Opinions page of yesterday’s edition of The Pitt News, there is a political cartoon‘
depicting two very stereotypical Tea Party members claiming, in satire, that the “greatest
evils” that the Republican Party is concerned with are witchcraft and masturbation.

I am a sophomore here at Pitt as well as a registered Republican, and although I do not
mind political satire, I simply wish to caution The Pitt News to maintain their j ournalistic
objectivity, lest the organization becomes the stereotypically, ﬁercely Democratic—themed
University publication.

With that being said, I wish The Pitt News will keep up the good work practicing the

First Amendment, and as always, Hail to Pitt. ‘

drawn by a Pitt student?

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

 

Last week, we gave you some hot tips for pick-
ing the graduateprogram of your dreams. Un-
fortunately, that’s the easy part. Once you select

a a program, you need to submit an application.

It takes all sorts of standardized test scores,
grade marks and preapproved loans to get
admitted to a program, and we can’t help you
with those things. However, we can help you
with the scariest aspect of the process: the
personal statement.

Personal statements are what university-
admissions ofﬁcers rely on to separate the
wheat from the chaff. Most personal state-
ments are chaff and wind up separated from
the wheat, whatever that means. However, if
your personal statement is eye-catching and
heart-stopping, you’re in like Flynn.

First, you must announce your intentions.
A good way to do this is a simple “Hey you!”
or “Listen up!” If you’re more of a formalist,
try a traditional salutation like “Hello Dears”
or “Dear Abby.”

With a powerhouse greeting like that, you’re
sure to have them hooked. Now it’s time to
reel them in, gut them and toss them in your
icebox. In other words, it’s time to tell your

sob story.

These admissions ofﬁcers read the same
old personal statement over and over again.
“I was president of my high school track and
debate teams, and I go to the dentist twice a
year.” Nerd alert! We’d want to tear our hair
out if we had to wade through this stuff. Even
if you were president of your track and debate
teams and are punctilious about matters of

dental hygiene, you can’t tell them thatbecause _

that’s what they’re expecting.

What they’re not expecting, friends, is a .

healthy dose of the unexpected.

Let rip with a real heartstring—tugger such
as this one: “After spending 20 years in the
orphanage, I decided the time had come for
me to cure Lyme disease as well as cancer, and
this is why I am applying for a Ph.D. in Comic
Strip Studies.” A

Isn’t that a humdinger? Howmany people
do you think have the courage needed totackle
a big task like curing Lyme disease as well as
cancer? How many people could do this just
by writing a dissertation on phallocentrism,
Bourdieu’s habitus and stereotype targeting in
“Peanuts?” Have no doubt about it: The per-
son reading your statement will never forget
you.

Another thing you have to include in your
personal statement is an inspiring quote. The_
Internet is a great place to ﬁnd these, but if

you’re abit pressed for time, you can try afew
of ours. We really like “It ain’t over till it’s over”
and “Takes one to know one.” Here’s how you
can incorporate those quotes, as well as many
others, in a paragraph that will bring down
the house even faster than the combination
of ﬁmnyman Steve Martin and rapper Queen
Latifah can:

“After I left the orphanage and decided on
the AIDS—curing path thatwas going to change
the world for the better, I said to myself, ‘It ain’t
over till it’s over.’ Then, a few hours later, I real-
ized that it ‘takes one ‘to know one.’ That was
the path less taken and the road not traveled,
but this is what happens when you go for the

gold. Ask not what you can do for your country
V accordingtojohn Fitzgerald Kennedy, but what‘

your country can do for you. Mr. Kennedy was

_ a man like myselfwho knew the value of a hard

day’s work, which is why he also said that sav-
ing a penny is just like earning one. In short,
I am going to hitch my wagon to a star, seize

~ the day and never stop believing.” .

If that doesn’t move the admissions ofﬁce
to tears, you can be sure that there isn’t a ﬁre in
the world hot enough to Warm her cold, cold
heart. Oh, and notice how we just used “her” in
that last sentence? You need to be extra careful

about gender these days, on account of all the .
' lawsuits, so we want you to use as many “she’s

and “l1er’s in your personal statement as pos-

It’s not easy to state it personally

sible. Regardless of your sex, refer to yourself
as “she” whenever you get a chance. Switching
into the third person to write, “She has always
wanted to cure Lyme disease ever since she
was a little girl,” will let the reader know what
a gender—conscious young person you are.
Now that you’ve followed these steps, you’re
pretty much enrolled. As that old urban legend
Santa Claus might say, it’s in the bag. But you
still have to conclude this thing, so it’s time
to fall back on those skills you honed when
you were signing your friends’ high-school
yearbooks. “Best wishes for a great summer”
is an excellent way to sign off, although a more
intimate phrase like “Hugs xoxo” demonstrates

a sweetness of character that is lacking in so ,

many of today’s' dispassionate scholars.

Do keep us posted about your applications,
true believers. Until next time, best wishes for
a great summer. ' —

Hugs xoxo, V ’

Parking’s too cheaphere. Yeah, that’s right p

Nick Stamatakis
For The Pitt News

We pay too much for some things —— meal
passes, Pokémon Cards, antique doll collec-
tions —— to the point where the value of the
money we spend isn’t worth the amount of
enjoyment we get out of the object.

But one place where we don’t spend nearly
enough, especially in Oakland, is on on—street,
metered parking.

Offended? Outraged? After all, why should
you pay just for the privilege of parking your
car? You aren’t really getting any service out
of it, and it’s not like it costs the city any-
thing. Many people from the countryside are
shocked that we pay at all.

But like oil and gold, parking is a commod-
ity. And unlike in thesuburbs or the country,
it is a rather limited commodity. But disparate

' from oil and gold, the prices for parking on
the street _— a few dollars per_hour — don’t
do anything to actually control the good’s
allocation. Parking is instead gobbled up and
hunted for like wild game.

To illustrate the dangers of poor alloca-

tion of commodities, think for a second if
the government decided it would sell heav-
ily discounted gumballs at various locations
across the city. Also assume that people have
an insatiable appetite for gumballs. With vir-
tually no cost, there would be no reason for
anybody not to have gum, and supplies would
become scarce, leading to gum searches
across the city. ‘ _

Worse than this, though, the people who
really needed the gum — the nail-biters, the
curry-lovers (guilty) and the easily sleepy -
wouldn’t be able to get the gum they needed
when they needed it ‘because of the shortage.
And I would rather not discuss what would
happen to the environmental state of the
bottom of classroom desks and chairs.

In other words, when prices for goods
aretoo low, there is a potential forresource
misuse. And as any Oakland driver can tell
you, resource misuse is a big problem in
parking.

Finding ‘a spot is very difficult because
many commuters take advantage of the cheap
spots, and just like gumball eaters, they feed
the meter all day using all the available park-
ing. The commuter, who could have gone to

the garage, uses up one spot for the entire —

day, Hunting its usage for everybody else. The
people who need street parking, like shop-
pers at small businesses or students going to
50-minute classes, now have to drive around
thecity looking for open spots. (

This_driving adds up. When parking is
underpriced, the average search time for
a‘ spot is 3.3 minutes, according to UCLA
parking-economics expert Donald C. Shoup’s
acclaimed research. _

A little over three minutes might seem
small individually,_but it’s really a huge time
loss when multipliedby all people looking
for parking. These milesdriven also produce
extra pollution, creating an environmental
cost. . ,

> Finally, all the people driving around look-
ing for parking creates ‘street congestion: In
San Francisco, the Urban Planning Associa-
tion estimated 30 percent of all traffic was
people looking for spots. The situation is akin
to agroup of 30 elementary schoolers playing
musical chairs for 15 openings.‘ ,
Raisingthe parking rates, however, would

"price out many drivers. Commuters would

go directly to a garage, and large swaths of

curb would free up for large parts of the day. '

More expensive spots would be used by more
people for shorter periods of time.

If you don’t believe me, read Shoup’s
700—plus—page juggernaut on parking poli-
cy, “The High Cost of Free Parking,” which
discusses these ideas at length. Planners
and economists who ascribe to his ideas,
self—described “Shoupistas” — apparently
parking aﬁcionados have a very good sense
of humor + shoot for parking rates which
leave only 85 percent of spaces occupied.

San Francisco and Los Angeles have piloted F

some areas of increased parking rates, and
tested areas have seen a reduction in parking
problems, extra money for neighborhood
improvement projects and no decrease in
patronage for businesses, as some critics
initially feared. Instead, there is less conges-
tion and higher parking turnover.

‘ What the rate would be in Oakland to get

to 85-percent occupancy, I don’t know. But -

it would create a situation much better than
the one today, where people search for long

‘ periods of time to ﬁnd a space. If everybody

just pays for their gumballs, life could be a
little bit easier; ”‘

Folk tales and music don’t just make a great ac-
companiment for bedtime — they make a fan-
tastic career for performers.

Taking modern rock styles and combining
them withfolk songs the members grewup with,
Great Big Sea creates a sound that both attracts
audiences and creates cultural diversity. The
band has been performing since 1993, gaining
popularity in Canada, Europe and the United
States alike.

“,Thethingiswe’vehadtwo careers — onein
Canada and one in America and Europe,” band
member Bob Hallett said. “They’re different. The
careerinCanadabeganwithacrazeforthis kind
of music. Our music videos got played and we
went on shows. We acquired physical rock star-
dom where people recognized you. In America,
webeganas apulp band and proceeded to gather
afollowingunder the radar of the national media.
Itfs two different worlds.”

Hallett sings and plays a variety of instru-
ments forthe band, fromaﬁddle to atinwhistle

andan accordion. The instrument line-up im-
mediately sets the band apart from others.
“We’re not reallyarock‘n’ roll band,” Hallett
said. “We use traditional music as the basis for
our music. It’s our "starting point for languages

' and rhythms. The deal is, we create a seamless

thingbetween what we wrote and what we grew
up wi .”
Hallett and his fellow bandmates have been

performers foralongtime, stayinginaband that

originally started as an experiment of sorts.

“It was a post-university employment proj-
ect,” Hallett said. “It was our part-time job in
college —— playing traditional music. When we
graduated we could proceed into whatever ca-
reers available. We’d been doingthis a long time
and had evolved, so we gave ourselves two years
to see where we wound up.”

And the bandjust kept on going. Hallett and

T hisfellow musicians, Sean McCann, AlanDoyle,

Kris MacFarlane and Murray Foster never felt the
desire to leave the ﬁeld, and over the years they
changed and evolved to keep up while holding
onto their original ideas.

“You can’t ignore what’s on the radio and
around you, and doingthis we’ve gotten to know
newpeople,” Hallettsaid. “Their approach seeps
in. Ifyou have an idea these days, there’s no box
and no idea that can’t be improved upon. The
idea is to create an ever-evolvingthing. We began
in a speciﬁc spot, but that can expand in any
direction.” '

Hallett enjoys traveling and performing in
new places and can’t complain about the advent
of new teclmologies. I

“Recording has gotten easierbecause it’s not
required to go to an expensive studio to make a
record,” he said. “You can do it with a laptop.
But performingis achance to do something new
every night. Our families were all sailors and nav-

elers, so for me it’s happyto wake up somewhere‘

new every day. I enjoy the constant motion.”

tonightas part of a Trust Series, hosted by the

The goal is to bring in an array of entertain- I

You might know Pittsburgh to be a lot
of things, but a historical place for comic-
books probably isn’t one of them.

Not only is it home to the Toonseum
— a museum dedicated to comics and car-
toons -—- but also

the original pages of “Pictopia,” Pitt

Ph.D. student and former professional

comic illustrator Don Simpson’s graphic
novella will be the subject of its own, ex-
hibit. ’ ..

The novella tells the story of a city in
which old comic book and newspaper
comic strip characters live in ghettos to
make room for the sleek full—color new
superhero comics and their urban renewal
project. . i

“It was an allegory of what was going on
in the comic—book business in those days
and probably still going on. Superheroes
are the dominant genre people identify
with comic books, and personal or id-
iosyncratic works have a harder time,”
Simpson said. V

.“Pictopia” isn’t only applicable to. the
comic book industry. “It can be interpreted
in terms of the modern world. The capital-
ist west has this hegemony over all other
cultures and forms of expression. It’s kind
of frightening,” Simpson said.

The 13-page work was created in 1986

for Fantagraphics, a comic-book publisher.

facing mounting legal fees as a result of
being sued for libel. Many professional
creators in the business donated their work
to raise money in an effort to save the pub-
lisher. “In the course‘ of that, Alan Moore
contributed this script [Pictopia] and I was
given a chance to draw it,” Simpson said.
Simpson had met the legendary British

graphic novelist Moore at a convention in
San Diego 1985 and, with the cocky brav-
ery only youth can muster, showed him a
sequence he had done mocking Moore’s
“Swamp Thing” comics.

“I was 23; I was fearless. It was all in
good fun. ,He actually knew who I was and
had read Megaton Man [the series Simpson
created satirizing the comic book ‘indus-
try]; he complimented me on it,” Simpson
said.

Thefateful page Simpson presented
Moore will hopefully be part of the show.

“Most scripts are like a set of Ikea in-
structions, but Alan’s was very unorthodox,
very detailed. I’ve never seen a script so
dense, so much background information
you couldn’t even draw and psychological
things about the characters. It was very
ingenious because what he succeeded in
doing was communicating all his ideas to
me as the artist,” Simpson said of the script
Moore presented to him,

Intense details aside, Moore left Simp-
son room to decide on how the novella was
to be drawn and framed. - I

“An Alan Moore script is very almost-
philosophical, like a treatise or something,
but he wasn’t concerned with whether I

- used a close up or a long shot as long as

I understood what was important to get
across to the reader,” Simpson said.

“Pictopia” has been reprinted several
times since its original release in “Anything
Goes II,” as well as featured in an anthology
titled “Best Comics of the Decade,” but it
is still difﬁcult to ﬁnd.

“It’s certainly not as widely seen as the
“Watchmen” or other major graphic novels
that are in print everywhere,” Simpson
said. '

In honor of the exhibit,'Toonseum will
reprint the novella as a stand-alone comic
book, which offered Simpson the oppor-
tunity to draw _a new cover whose charac-
ter he hadn’t drawn in 25 years. Simpson
contacted many of the people involved in
the original publication and collected their

   

memories of working on the project, which.

will be included in the stand-alone book.
“It’s been very interesting because I’m

totally in a different place now, studying.

his graphic novel roots. ’

Simpson received his B.A. from Pitt in
2007 and is now working on his doctoral

dissertation on American architectur ' by

urban planning. ‘ - - » _

‘‘I’ve been following the path” of least re_—
sistance and it’s worked out pretty well. As
an artist, I’ve gone to museums all my life
and I knew what I liked and what I wanted

to make, but had a lot of intellectual ques- I

tions about what is it that other people see
' in art. I wanted to understand the value of

‘art to society and try to escape t_he‘si_‘ngular ‘

point of viewpof the artist,” he said.

As a graduate student,Simpson teaches . .

an Art History writing class at Pitt and de-
bated theethics of assigning his students
to write on his show.

“Tl1at’d be weird for me. I’m not sure it’s
actually art, more pop culture or kitsch or
something, kind of ironic, kindiof kitsch.
Maybe it’ll be extra credit, I don’t know. I

the kind of band where, if wewrote it let’s do
it,” Hallett said. “It has to survive the opinion of

everyone who hears it. It’s an ongoing process. _

That’s where it gets difﬁcult. It’s easy to write a
song, not easy to convince everyone it’s good
enoug ”

Hallett considers the band fortimate to have a
rocksolidfanbase andanideaofwhat it intendsto
do as the music industry changes and the Internet

- remains a new tool.

“In many  when we started, we followed
aconventional modelwitharecord deal,” he said.
“On one end, major labels fund and create rock
stars". They’re marketing muscles. They aren’t
doing that anymore. It’s difficult to see where new
rock stars are comingfrom. On the other hand,
the Internet offers a huge opportunity. If you’re
diligent, you can create your own fan base. The
wholeworldis now open to you. It’s good and bad,
and for a lot of artists it depends on where they
are in their career. We were well—established so,
we could expand on a healthy fan base.”

But that doesn’t eliminate certain risks that

. ' go with traveling. Bad ﬂights, bus accidents and

the occasional loss of money have let’: abad taste
in Hallett’s mouth; but he’s stuck with music this
longforareason. .
“There’s always something going wrong, but
when you get an hour and a half of people livin
your songs, it’s worth it,” he said. ,1 '

Alecxih building off 3 —sac

Chas Alecxih sacks New Hampshire quarterback R.J. Toman in the horn

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

Coming out ofhigh school, Chas Alecxih didn’t

have a scholarship offer to Pitt. In fact, he was
set on going to Albany, a Division 1—AA school.

But he decided to take a chance and come
to Pitt as a preferred walkion, a chance that is
now paying off for him. - P . ,

“It was a combination of my parents en-
couraging me to come here because they liked
the program, the coaches here convincing me
thatIwasn’t goingto be justapiece of meat and
really giving me a chance, and my conﬁdence in

be my abilities,” Alecxih said. “I could come here

and I could contribute.” ’ _
«. After earningascholarship before the 2009

f much~,relying on the lilieéto

season, Alecxih is now a starter at defensive
tackle and he’s givingall Panthers fans reason to
have the same conﬁdence in him that he had of
himselfcoming out ofPenn Manor High School
in central Pennsylvania. ~—
He compiled four sacks last season playing
behind now-departed seniors Mick Williams

and Gus Mustakas, and almost matched that

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

When Pitt fans turn on the TV, they seldom
see sports stations talking about the Pan-
thers, but now Pitt has its own channel.

Channel 188 debuted on Comcast yes-
terday as Pitt Panthers Television, which
will air live games as well as analysis and
pre—and—post-game coverage. The network
is on channel 210 in some areas outside
the city. at

It will give fans an additional 500 hours
of coverage every year.

”“We are so pleased to team with Com-
cast to bring Panthers fans hundreds of
new hours of Pitt programming,” Athletic
Director Steve Pederson said in a news

release._ “We know from our current view-

ership numbers that the public wants as
much Pitt sports programming as we can
give them.” I

In addition to live football, men’s bas-
ketball and women’s basketball games will
air on the new station. Some volleybal-‘l’
games and other ‘sports will be featured
as well. V

“This will also give us an opportunity
to showcase our entire program in a way
that has not ‘been previously seen,” Ped-

There will be eight consecutive hours
of coverage everysfimday from 11 a.‘m. to
7 p.m. The _coverage kicks off this week

(with a Miami pre—g§_rr1e show from 5:30 to

a fact that points toward only better numbers
over time from the 28'o‘—pound»tackle.

‘ “When I came in I really didn’t do many
moves, and I still don’t do a ton of moves. I kind
of just try to slip by people,” he said. “I try to
use my hands real well but I’rn still working on

' developing a good bull rush, a good wiper and

“I hope that by the time I keep playing a little

He’s also picked up alot of tips about playing -
the position from the ‘guy who starts next to
him on the line, fellow redshirt junior defensive
tackle Myles Caragein.

. “Myles is smarter than me when it comes to
-this kind of stuff. He’s the rock in the middle and
makes sure everyone knows what they’re do-

whereas I’m very different My technique needs
a lot of work sometimes and I can get out of

Yet, Alecxih thinks that it’s this exact thing
that makes it diiﬁcult for opposing teams to
handle their contrasting styles.

“I think our style helps_us because for op-
posing teams it’s hard to handle both of us,
his kind of conservative style and my kind of
reckless,” he said.

Caragein said he expects big things from

the stats, and if his strong play causes him to
get double teamed, it’s just going to help free
up Caragein orsomeone else on the defense to
make a big play.

“I know if I give Myles a single block and
if I draw the center and the guard, I know he’s
goingto make ‘a play,” Alecxih said. “If given the
opportunity he’s going to make a big play.”

With the highly anticipated game against the
Miami Hurricanes coming up tomorrow, there’s
some added excitement around the team’s prac-
tice facilityinthe South Side. ’

Alecxih said that he’s had this game circled

on his calendar for months now.

But maybe Miami itself, after watching the
