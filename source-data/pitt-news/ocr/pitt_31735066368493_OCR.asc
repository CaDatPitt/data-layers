Senate

Passes
Dental Plan

By BRIAN BALl(
And CHARLIE O'HA_RA

The University Senate passedga 
new dental subsidy plan after‘ a‘
heated discussion during yesterday’s \

meeting.

The plan was unanimously.‘

accepted after Senior Vice Chancel-
lor Jack Freeman proposed an
amendment that called for a differ-
ence in insurance funding between
across the board and merit

salaries—a .5 percent decrease _,

which will save approximately 1.5
million from the original dental plan
proposed. A
The smaller income Pitt employee
will beneﬁt more from this newly
proposed plan. The plan will need 75

percent approval by eligible faculty ‘

members to be passed. _ _

Provost,Rhoten Smith, who was
filling in for Chancellor Wesley Pos-
var, discussed the newly proposed
computer system. According‘ to
Smith, the acquisition of a high
speed, digital computer system ‘is
necessary to upgrade the existing
system. The original computer plan
was rejected in September.

presented_is called the VAX.’ 1/780. M V

Bishopurges Nuc|earDisarmamenti

By D.J. CASE

There have been many solutions
offered to end the nuclear arms race,
but one man’s answer to this life
threatening dilemma "is unparal-
leled. In a speech entitled “A
Moral Dilemma: Nuclear Prolifera-
tion or Disarmament,” Bishop L.T.
Matthiesen" urged the near-capacity

crowd in David Lawrence last night

to “pray with the strength that Jesus
Christ had when he faced annihila-
tion on the cross.”

Matthiesen, a native of Amarillo,
Texas’, lives 15 miles from Pantex
Corporatin-——the final assembly
point for all nuclear warheads in th
United States. ‘

“Pantex is often.i'n my thoughts
these days, thrust there by the
troubled conscience of one of its
employees who came to me and said,

. ‘Bishop, I‘m beginning to think it’s,

wrong for me to work at a place
where, if these weapons were ever
used, I may be part of the destruc-
tion of the earth,’” Matthiesen said.

Distressed by this possibility,
Matthi_esen said he called on the

"workers of the Pantex plant to

search their consciences and con-
sider quitting.

.Matthiesen said the. nuclear arms
build-up was the “most urgent prob-
lem_” that the world is confronted
with.

“The nuclear nations, including
ours,,have been lured by technologi-
cal developments into a morally
untenable position," he said. “A
position which can no longer be legi-
timized by traditional Christian
moral measurements." .

Explaining the past political role
of the Catholic church, Matthiesen
said that while the church has always
been a staunch supporter of the U.S.
defense policy, this is now changing.

He cited the recent Catholic Con-
ference of Bishops, in which church

"leaders came out against nuclear

   

Hesaid the members of the con-
ference concluded that defense stra-
tegy based on power of deterence
cannot be morally defended.

“The balance continues to be seen
as dangerously tipped in favor of the
adversary and this perception is used
to justify the continuing and relent-
less development and assembling of

- ever more sophisticated and devas-

tating weapons which only adds to

the urgency of the moment,” Mat-
thiesen said. V
The conference document also

condemns all-out nuclear war,
limited nuclear war, the ﬁrst use of
any weapons and the threat of using
them.
Matthiesen said that William Clark,
special adviser on defense and secur-
ity for the president “begged us not
to say that because...[we] will des-
troy our deterrent policy.”

; Matthiesen pointed out the irony

A of the government’s policy by say-

ing, “Few told the church to stay out
of politics when the ‘just war’ theory
was being developed and taught by

the church. One surmises the issue is

not whether the church ought to. -

have anything to say about ‘such
matters. Rather, what is disturbing

to many today is that the church is A.
drawing conclusions with which‘

they are not comfortable.

“My "own conviction is,”.Mat-
thiesen said, “that we should say

‘No’.” One simply cannot remain .

silent on this issue; to remain silent is
to give assent to the continuationof
what can only be described ‘as a

hopeless arms race. ‘

Thirty Pitt students_ were
among ‘thousands to travel to
Washington, D.C., on Tuesday
to participate in ‘National Stu-
dent Action Day.

The sponsoring organization,
the United States Student Asso-
ciation (US SA), held the event to
give students a chance to lobby
their representatives for more‘
financial aid. =

The Pitt students met with
Congressman James Coyne's
educational aide, Congressman
Doug Walgren, and an aideof’
Senator Allen Spector. John
Heinz refused to meet with the
student coalition that ‘featured
members from the Progressive
Student Network (PSN) and the
Governmental Relations Com-
mittee (GRC).

Torn Wanko of PSN said‘ he
.was_~glad to see students taking
an interest in - the "lobbying,

_' process.  ‘ _

“Students must realize that to
protect student aid they must get
active in lobbying at the federal,
state, and local level,” he said. “It
does_ have an effect and in _this

- next decade students are going to

face more cuts.” »

Avery Abrams, treasurer of
the GRC, said many of the pro-
posed cuts and bills will have an
effect on’ Pitt students and they
should be aware of these effects.
The Solomon Amendment, for
example, will have _ an effect
because students who are not
registered for the draft will not
receive financial aid. '

“Draft registration is discrimi-
natory against poor- and middle-'
income people and reflects the
overall Reagan policy of favorit-
ism to the wealthy,” Abrams
said. “Student voter registration
and participation in lobbying
should increase to make students
a voice and force to be reckoned
with.”

from USSA, said that the Rea-
gan Administration’s l984
budget will mean that over one

passed. ' '

“This budget‘s emphasis. on
‘student self-help’ translates into
more dependence on student

said. -

Editors To Discuss Publishing

"By RON BARBER

Pitt_‘s Seventh Annual Writers’
Conference will be held in Oakland
next weekend. Among the awards,
readings and lectures will be a
number of programs focusing on the
publishing industry.

Jonathan Brent—formerly an edi-

. torof the literary journal TriQuar-

terly and founder and editor of the
literary magazine Formations—will
open the weekend’s activities Satur-
day morning with a discussion of
“The World of Small Presses.”

Small publishers—1ike Ecco,
Godine and Northpoint presses-
generally produce fewer than 15
-titles each year. Although tradition-
ally plagued by marketing problems,

, Brent claims that the future of small

presses is bright. “Small presses can
afford to take risks; they have a low
overhead, and they are vital in keep-
ing ideas alive," he said.

— ilmmediately following Brent’s
talk, literary agent John Ware will
discuss what literary agents do, and
how to go about finding one.
Ware explains that a good agent
can help publishers as well as assist-
ing writers in selling their manus-
cripts. Since there are more than
40,000 new books published each
year, publishers often cannot give

much attention _to individual
manuscripts.

“We screen material and give it a
stamp of approval. When we send a

book to an editor, he knows that a
professional has looked at it,” Ware
explained. '
Saturday afternoon, a panelof
editors will wrap up the discussion

of the publishing industry, giving

tips on “Selling ,What You Write.”

Included on this panel will be Gary
Fisketjon, a senior editor for Ran-
dom House and editor of their
anthology. The Random Review
1982; Susan Margolis, associate edi-
tor of Playboy; and Clifford May,
formerly an editor of The New York
Times Magazine and Geo, and
recently named West African corres-
pondent for The New York Times.
Times.

The “Selling What You Write”
session has been among the most
popular features of past Writers’
Conferences.

On Sunday, Clifford May will
join Mel Watkins, an author and an
editor of The New York Times Book
Review, to discuss the work
involved in writing and editing’The
New York Times. This program,
entitled “Close-Up: The New York
Times” will begin at ll:30 a.m. in
Pitt’s Frick Fine Arts Building.

The Writers’ Conference pro-
grams for the morning and after-
noon of Saturday, March 19, will
also be held in the Fine Arts Build-
ing. Complete schedules and ticket
information are available from the
university’s ticket office on the third
floor of Forbes Quad.

Affirmative Action Policies Examined  

By.PEGGY FERRI

The Reagan Administration's
cuts in financial aid to higher educa-
tion are a concern not only for stu-
dents, but also for the university
Affirmative Action Committee,
which is examining how affirmative
action programs can be imple-
mented without increasing univer-

sity costs.

“The student financial aid picture
didn’t get as bad as expected,” assist-
ant affirmative action director
Michael Bruner said, “but the com-
mittee is concerned about the impact
of cuts on the recruitment and reten-
tion of -minority students. We would
like to come forth with ideas on
[among others] Pitt’s policies on stu-
dent aid and howthe funds can be
allocated.”

The committee serves only in an
advisory capacity to the chancellor,
‘through the Office of Affirmative
Action.

For the last year and a half, the
committee, which is divided into
three sections, has channel_e,d- its

efforts into reviewing all university
policy on faculty, staff and students_.
where improvements are needed and
has been discussing the possibility of
drafting auniversity-wide policy for
students much like the ones already
in existence for employees, accord-
ing to Michael Bruner.

Reviewers will not release their
findings so far, but all investigation
findings are sent to each dean and
senior administrator.

“We have been needing —a
university-wide policy for students
for a while,” Bruner said. “It makes
sense to have a uniform policy for
Pitt students. The university does
have policies, but they are
scattered.”

For example,’ Pitt has policies
concerning academic integrity at
Pitt, student life and judicial proce-
dures, buteach school also has its
own affirmative action policy as do
the offices of admissions and finan-
cial aid. ' -

According to Vice-Chancellor for

‘Student Affairs Dr. Dennis Don-

ham, the purpose of the on-going
review process is student
accessibility-—making certain that

all programs and services are equally
accessible to all students. ‘

An area of concern in this respect
has been the reforms in College of
Arts and Sciences requirements, or
more specifically, the new language
requirements.

“The requirements for language
background,” Donham explained,
“present a change for in—coming stu-
dents.” Minority students, he said,
coming from schools that sometimes
do not have good language instruc-
tion can find themselves at a
disadvantage.

He added the concern is that Pitt
is raising something that might neg-
atively affect some groups.

“We don’t know the answer, but
we do have these concerns,” Don-
ham said. . ‘

Another concern Donham menti-
oned is cuts in advising an important
priority.

That the cutback may affect one
group more than another is some-
thing to watch, Donham explained.
For instance, the cuts could be dis-
advantagous for those students who
already have academic difficulties.

At the beginning of the year, the
committee sent a letter of concern to

 

.~::JbtshnZl;.I tmgsimiasen

CAS dean Irwin‘Schulman.

Director of Student Aid Dan May
is working mostly with aid policies
and said he is especially interested in
support for students who are not
part of academic or athletic support
programs.

“What support can these students
look for from Pitt,” he asked. “There
is no specific program for average
blacks or whites; programs are
based on entitlement or membership
in a specific program.” i

The idea, "according to May, is to
be the mostcost effective with the
reduced funds the university receives
and see how the policies can be
improved to take care of the average
student‘ while not taking funds away
from other areas doing it.

Other student concerns that the
committee has been examining
include the problems of foreign stu-
dents and child-care facilities for
students whovare in need of it.

The committee, which was suc-
cessful in having the university
adopt the Pitt affimiative action

program, approved by the U.S.

Department of Labor in 1982,
agrees that Pitt has a much better

record than most universities in

affirmative action, butthat is no rea-

pliance with federal

- program. .

son to rest on its laurels.

Pitt has been found to be in com-
guidelines,
according to Bruner. Grievances, he
added, can be brought to the atten-
tion of his office, but the individual
should be willing to go through a

thorough investigation if he does not

receive satisfaction. a

“In cases of discrimination,”
Bruner explained, “it often comes
down to your word against the other
person’s.” He also admitted that an
indicator of. discrimination is the
non-representation of those who are
available and qualified for the

“We play a kind of watchdog
role," Donham said." “Although we
appear statistically to be admitting‘
minorities and others, figures can be
very misleading.” _

May agreed and added that there
is a problem in properly identifying
the composition of the student pop-

- ulation at Pitt. Still, May said that

the general guidelines are fair.

The results of the reviews will be I .

discussed at the next meeting, but a
university-wide policy is something
all members agree will take a longer
time due to the size and complexity
of Pitt and the students who attend.

Senate Passes Plan

allows for incorporation with the
existing system because it has the
capability of networking.
According to Smith, the new sys-
tem will cost no more than the origi-
nal plan. The new system will add

‘approximately 200 Remote Job

Entry (RJE) terminals to the present
system. ‘
“These mini computers will
offload a large share of computing
because they will be used primarily

_for instructional purposes," Smith

said. This system will in turn allow
for more availability for research
purposes.

Smith also discussed Pitt's meet-
ing-with the State H-ouse and Senate
Appropriations Committee last Sat-
urday. He _said that the meetings,
which were held in a mild and pro-
fessional manner, seemed to estab-
lish a good rapport.

Among the issues discussed were
enrollment trends and minorities.

Eight percent of the overall and 10.5 ’

percent of the undergrad‘uate'enroll-
ment are minority students, Smith
said.

Pitt also reported on the Pitt-
CMU Ben Franklin Partnership

last week by the state.

T‘he‘Pitt News,’ Wednesday March 9, 1983

' By MARY ANNAKRUPA

McCormick, Amos, Litchﬁeld,

V Clapp,' Frick—these names are

familiar to any Pitt student, but how

"many students.rea1ize the signifi-

cance of these names? It is not an
easy task to select the appropriate
individual to honor when naminga
new building.

David Lawrence Hall, one of the
most recently erected structures on
the Pitt campus, is named after a
former governor of Pennsylvania, a
man who represented not only the
ideals that the university embraces

in educational progress, but the dyn- r

ar'nism~ that propels cities and
‘nations to greatness.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar, at the
_hall’s dedication ceremony in June,
l97l, said of Lawrence, “The late
Governor Lawrence was a loyal
friend of .the university, and a great
portion of our physical growth can
be directly attributed to his.int‘erest

in providing the facilities in which

greater numbers of our citizens
could enjoy the benefits of a higher
education." .

In officially presenting Lawrence
Hall to the university, Robert Jones,
executive director of the General

State Authority, praised Lawrence"

as “one who dreamed of better edu-
cation for the less fortunate and
worked forvthe financial aid which
made‘ that dream a reality." _
‘Lawrence, who was born in Pitts-

burgh in 1889, was elected governor

of Pennsylvania in 1958. He was the
first Catholic ever to win thispofﬁce.
As the mayor of Pittsburgh from
1946 to 1958, he rose to prominence

as the innovator of much of the post-

war progress that became known as

Pittsburgh’s first renaissance.
Lawrence did not finish high

school; he left early to complete a

two-year commercial course and

become an office boy for William J.
Brennan, Democratic party leader

‘ of Pittsburgh.

E David Lawrence Hall. Part of Pitt's History

According to an article in the
March, 1959 issue of The Saturday
Evening Post,“He sat in on political
meetings; he listened and he
learned.” Equipped with a feel for
politics, he rose from ward worker
to Allegheny County Democratic
chairman in 1920. During World
War I, he served as an enlisted man
in the office of Judge Advocate Gen-
eral in Washington, D.C.

After Franklin Delano Roose-"O

velt's victory in 1933, _ Lawrence
became collector of internal revenue
for the western district of Pennsylva-
nia. He resigned this position in 1934
to become chairman of the Demo-
cratic State Committee.

Time Magazine reported in 1957
that when Roosevelt “rolled into the
White House, David Lawrence
rolled into statewide power, drag-
ging with him his own candidate for
governor, businessman George H,
Earle." Lawrence served as Secre-
tary of the Commonwealth during
Ear1e’s term in office and was consi-
dered by many -to be the real ruler of
Pennsylvania.

In 1945, Lawrence ran as the
Democratic candidate for mayor of
Pittsburgh; he was eventually
elected for an unprecedented four
terms.

During his 16 years in office, Law-

rence launched the program of
re_1uvenatio.n for Pittsburgh that ele-
vated the city to notoriety as one of
the best cities in the country.

An article in The Christian
Science Monitor in 1958 described
the turn-around that the city took
under Lawrence’s leadership:

“It’s soot was once so heavy that
housewives washed their curtains
once a week. Office lights were
turned on at noon, property values
in the Golden Triangle dwindled and
business firms "found it -hard to
recruit executives who would con-
‘sent to live h_er_e.in Pittsburgh.

enthusiasm."

.“Today, a sparkling constellation
of modern skyscrapers stands in its
center. The air is I smog-free.
Century-old slums are being razed.
New bridges and expressways are
being built and a $1 billion industrial
expansion program is underway.”

Lawrence earned a reputation as
one of the last of the. big city
“bosses.” He lent a new meaning to
the old party style of boss, as a pow-
erful and effectual reformer.

During his mayorship, Lawrence
was considered the most powerful

big-city mayor in the United States,
and a survey by the editors of For-
tune Magazine put Pittsburgh
among the eight best-administered
cities in the country.

Lawrence, who died in 1966,
served for two decades as a trustee of
the University of Pittsburgh, and
Posvar cited his role as a major
reformer for better education at the
dedication ceremonies foe Lawrence
Hall.

“Under Lawrence’s leadership,”
Posvar said, “Pennsylvania began to
shoulder its responsibilities in higher
education with vigor and

Lawrence was also a fierce cam-
paigner for the rights of minorities
and established» a Human Relations
Commission along with a Fair
Housing Board. He pressed hard for
fair public housing over what" former
mayor Joseph Barr called, “The
vehement protests of advocates of _
racial conﬁnement.”

The hall that came to be known as
-David Lawrence Hall was formerly
the Common Facilities Building.
The structure was built in 1968 and
dedicated to Lawrence in _a cerem-
ony that included, in addition to
Posvar, former trustee emeritus
Joseph B_arr, and the Most Reve-
rend Bishop of the Diocese of Pitts-
burgh, Vincent Leonard.
Lawrence’s son, Gerald Lawrence,
spoke at the ceremony on behalf of
the family.

 Apartheid is Still Strong

The Pitt News, Wednesday March 9, 1983

By 0.1. CASE

Various governmental officials
gathered Saturday at the 23rd com-
memoration of the Sharpeville Mas-
sacre to speak. out against the
continuous injustices suffered by
black people in South Africa.

The Sharpeville Massacre
occured when police opened fire on
a peacefully assembled crowd of
5,000 women, men and children,
killing 67 and wounding 186. The
crowd had gathered to protest the
“pass laws"—the mandatory carry-
ing of reference books. Failure to
produce one upon demand of the
police is a criminal offense. '

Featured guest speaker was
former Supreme Court Justice Wil-
liam'H. Booth, president of the
American Committee, on Africa.
Booth went to South Africa to
observe blacks on trial for pass law
violations. . ‘

_ “They have separate everything
there,” hesaid. “They have separate
black trials. White judges,_ white
lawyers, blacks on, trial. I was told
that black trials take 90 seconds.
Real pleatbargaining. They [defend-

‘ ants] aretold that if they plead

guilty, they will get 60 to 90 days

.hard.‘labor on a white man-’s farm. .

And _that’s what supports the farm

A system there—all these prisoners.”

‘According to booth, “L900 black
people are arrested every day for
pass law violations.”

“You have to haveit [the pass] on

your person at all times," Booth
explained. “The pass tells where you
were born, where you work, where
you live—everything about you-if
you’re black, I5 and up, men and
women.” _ ’,

Booth reported 22 million blacks
live on 13 percent ofthe land divided
into tiny separate lots and are gov-
erned by 4 million whites who con-

ol 87 percent of the land. -

Blacks are not allowed to live in
the cities. They are forced to live in
the surroundingtownships in homes
they can't own, he said. They pay
rents that are dictated by the govern-
ment. They work only when they are
permitted to work by the companies

for which they work. If they get
injured and no longer able to work,
they are separated from their fami-
lies and sent to camps. Black
,workers get paid substantially lower
wages, Booth said, than whites who

a do equal work.

As an example, Booth cited the
Tsumeb Mines——owned and oper-
ated by United States companies.

Black miners get. paid the equivalent.

of $2.21 for a six-day week. White
miners, he said, get paid 10 times
thatimuch.

Booth estimated
between 350 and "400 American cor-
porations doing business in South
Africa and Nambia. “Those corpo-
rations make 24 to 40 percent profit

_ off of black backs. They pay huge
taxes to the Republic of South
' ‘Africa, shoring up apartheid. These

out of there,” he said.

There is a movement in the U nited
States aimed at putting pressure on
individual corporations to divest
themselves of their interests in South
Africa. Some states have passed
laws limiting investment in South
Africa. United States congressman
Bill Coyne, also present, discussed
legislation he introduced that would
“address itself to prohibiting new
investment in South Africa by cor-

' porations in this country.”

“I think our- foreign policy and
‘our_ business investments should
reflect the values this country is sup-
posed to stand for,” Coyne said.
“Those values of freedom, justice
and dignity for all people, not just
some people. And I can tell you

those values are sorely missing when '

it comes to the government of South
Africa.” ‘

State Representative K. Leroy
Irvis iterated his support for divest-
ment. “It is an insensitivity of those
corporations that equate dollars as
being more worth while than human
lives, and many of those corpora-

,tions have headquarters right here in
Pittsburgh. Therefore, those of us
who believe that if you squeeze the
dollar, you may make the corpora-
tions ’ aware must cooperate in
squeezing that dollar.

, “What you and I need to do is not
change South Africa but change
America so that America brings the
pressure on South Africa.”_

Pittsburgh was chosen as the
show site because it nowiranks
third in the country in the con- .
centration of Fortune 500 head-»

research, development and tech-
nology with more than I70 labs

Although ' draft registration
and financial aid affect a large
portion of the male population-at
Pitt, only three people showed
up last night to hear a lecture
entitled “The Draft and- Finan-
cial Aid.”

. "1 wouldn't be too disap-
pointed about this [the lack of

'_attendance]," said Rev. Torn

Taylor, a United Methodist‘min-
ister and draft counselor.-“This is
what’s happening right now.”

Regardless of their interest or
lack of it, the issue will directly
affect many students. All men
~born since 1960 who reach the
age of 18 are required to register
for the draft within 30 days of
their birthday. Those students
who don’t register will face the
possibility of losing their federal
financial aid in.addition to risk-
ing a prison sentence of five years
and/or a fine of $10,000.

This will come about under a
plan called the Solomon,Amend-
ment, which will be published by

. the Department of Education

this June. The regulations call
for schools to obtain a registra-
tion compliance statement from
every student who accepts fed-
eral financial aid.

The statement will show that
the student is registered or is not
required to register because the
student is female, not yet 18, was-
born before 1960 or is a perma-
nent resident of the Pacific
Islands or the Northern Marian
Islands.

Tim Sperry, a draft counsellor
from the Thomas Merton Cen-
ter, said all the documentation
will be a “bureaucratic night-
mare” for ‘everyone, including
the Selective Service Committee.

Currently, the Selective ‘Ser-
vice is trying to prosecute over
40,000 draft resisters a year,
Sperry said. During the Vietnam
War, 96'percent of the draft re-
sisters were successful in escap-
ing the draft. Taylor estimates
that the current success rate is 97
percent. He said the government
does not have the manpower or-
the money to catch today’s
resisters.

There is also the option of

A being listed as a conscientious

objector, although the two coun-
sellors agreed that is difficult.

“Gut feelings aren't valid,”'

Sperry said.

Taylor explained that a man
who wants to qualify for C.O.
status needs to document his
stance, be able to articulate his
objections in the light of estab-
lished philosophical,.religious or
ethical schools of thought and
prove that he lives in a manner
consistent with those views. But
if there is a draft, he still _must
serve two years in some support
capacity.

The Thomas Merton Center
deals with questions and prob-
lems concerning draft registra-
tion, conscientious objector
status and ‘information on the
Solomon Amendment."

  Empty
Sheﬂs?

‘Another program has fallen victim to the ruthless
budget ax: Pitt recently announced that the Internship
Office will permanently close on June 30.

This office, run by Nancy Denhart and designed to
match students with opportunities to gain work expe-
rience outside of the university, has served over 600
students already this year.

The administration’s justification for this latest cut
simply echoed reasons given for other cuts earlier this
year. Dr. Robert Gallagher of the Career Counseling
Center said that the office was faced with the need for
budget cuts, involving a choice between “diluting
other established programs until there’s nothing but a
shell left or dropping a subprogram such as the Intern-
ship Office.”

While this excuse may have explained the athletic
department’s recent decisionto eliminate two “non-
revenue sport” programs, it leaves much to be desired
in justifying the fate of the Internship Office.

With competition in the job market fueled by
double-digit unemployment, college graduates who
have “hands-on” experience in their fields have a great
advantage. Internships, because they offer just‘ that
kind of experience, should be an important part of any
college program.

Gallagher has remarked optimistically that depart-
mental advisers across the university may take up
much of the work of theilnternship Office, making
students aware of internship opportunities in their
field. Unfortunately, a moment’s thought reveals that
this optimism is not well founded.

‘First, most advisers accept those duties in addition
to teaching or other responsibilities. Can students
expect them to research a broad range of internship
opportunities? Second, if each adviser did make an
effort to find internships for interested students, he
would be engaged in a massive and costly duplication
-of effort which is avoided by maintaining a central
internship office. A

Most importantly, students may wonder what pro-
grams are being saved from becoming “empty shells”
at the expense of the Internship Office? Are they more
important than this program, which can have a pro-
found impact on a student's career opportunities?

One thing is certain: Pitt students will not find the
answer to these questions. The Pitt administration,
like baseball umpires, will stand by even the worst of
decisions. »

Letters To The

Editor

Staring At The Rocks

Dear Editor:

The absurdity of Jim Kane’s
recent column, “The Rise of The
1983 Collegiate Vidiot,” provided

me with a few chuckles that were i

followed by a feeling of modest con-
cern. Drawing causal links between
television programming and human

' behavior is always a‘ risky undertak-

ing, too often pursued by pedants
who possess, at best, only scant sup-
portive information.

The programming in question is
cable's Music'Television (MTV).
According to Mr. Kane, the cable

‘ television station’s rock video pieces

all but lobotomize helpless colle-

giate viewers with colorful, some-
times hypnotic, concepts. To Mr.
Kane's dismay, he reports that such
viewing habits stifle interpersonal
communication and produce gawk-
ing “speechless zombies”. To further
his point, _he resorts to a cute, but
ridiculously presumptive,
comparison—-“MTV and intelligent
conversation are like General Kha-
daffi andsane humans—polarized.”
I realize that Mr. Kane is natu-
rally biased with respect to his own
. self-importance, but who is tojudge
whether or not a conversation with
him would be potentially intelligent
or enlightening? I would suggest
leaving that decision in the hands of

his inferior peers. It is, after all, pos-
sible that they like watching MTV,
and just maybe they have nothing to
say to him or each other. Could it be

.that Mick Jagger has a bit more‘cha-

risma than Mr. Kane? ,
If Jim Kane is so bent on interper-
sonal stimulation for‘ the betterment .
of his peers, perhaps he should seek
out a fresh group of friends who are
capable of functioning at his level.
How about a cave full of hermits? I
would be careful with the pomposity ’
and condescension though. The her-
mits may prefer staring at rocks.

A Disastrous Night

Dear Editor:

An enjoyable evening at the Syria
Mosque for a PPC dance turned
into a disastrous one. At approxi-
mately 12:45 Sunday morning, we
witnessed a case of what we would
police harassment, which
proved to us to be totally unneces-
sary. The driver ofa car with several
passengers- was leaving the quad
when he discovered the exit was
blockedby a barricade. In order for
"him to get on to Fifth Ave., he had
no choice but to get outof his car
and move the barricade.

As he did so, he was abruptly
approached by a campus policeman
who ordered him not to move the
barricade and then proceeded to

"Dear Editor:

In an article entitled “NCAA:
Wracked With Problems,”assistant
sports editor Mark A. Sindler stated

that the annual NCAA meeting of.

Division I schools .turned into quite
an argument with the possibility of
more to arise. It seems that the
debate surrounded the issue of hav-
ing all freshmen score at least 700 on
the SAT or IS on the ACT college
entrance exams in order to partici-
pate in organized sports. This deci-
sion has been labeled racist by
numerous black presidents who
claim there would" be a drastic
decline of black athletes on the
teams of schools which have major
T ‘a.th_letic’pr‘o'gra‘r'r1s." ' T  ‘~ ' >-

-..-1

While it may be necessary for a
student to meet certain standards
before attending college, is it fair for
the NCAA to randomly select a
number out ofthe sky as its mean of
acceptance?" This method proves to
be unfair to blacks simply because,
according to the latest estimates, 90
percent of black students would fail
to meet these standards.

I believe that changes must be
made in the standards set forth by
the NCAA regarding college eligibil-
ity and that the NCAA should ana-
lyze the problem as it stands instead
of trying to make a quick decision
for a deep-rooted problem.

‘Dear Editor:

The editorial, “Scare Tactics” (Feb. 18),
seems to have entirely missed the point con-
cerning the purpose of the Reagan Adminis-
tration’s regulation requiring parental
notification when minors have been pro-
vided with prescription birth control drugs
or devices in a federally-funded cl-inic. The
primary purposefor the issuing of this regu-
lation is concern for the health of minor
children—not their morals, as the editorial
writer contends.

Remember that this regulation is con-
cernedwith prescription drugs and devices.
That means birth control pills and lUDs—
both of which can be extremely detrimental

to the health of any woman but especially to_

that of young girls. Also, remember that the

regulation will not affect non-prescription '

birth control methods available at clinics or
at the local drugstore.

‘It seems incredible to me thatiny sisters
need parental permission to have their ears
pierced, to go on a field trip with their class,
to be X-rayed in an emergency room after an
accident or to receive an aspirin from the
school nurse for a headache, yet when it

comes to receiving drugs or devices which
can permanently harm them, your editorial

Ghandi AndAsam

Dear Editor:

How would Gandhi,the apostle of non-
violence, react to the carriage of Asam,
which, at the time of the writing of this letter,
has claimed 3,600 human lives? One can eas-
ily imagine how dismayed Gandhi would
have been if he were alive today. Yet unfor-
tunately, the reactions of these tragic series
of events in the Indian capital have been
perfunctory, to put _it charitably.

The irony of it is that India is the largest
democracy, at least population-wise, in the
present world and ostensibly pursues a pol-
icy of secularism. The massacre of Bengalis
(mainly Muslims) in Asam, a north-eastern
province of , India, is particularly anti-

climaticat a time when'Mahatma Gandhi’s -

philosophy of non-violence and religious
tolerance are getting worldwide attention,

thanks to the motion picture “Gandhi.”

' Since the massacre of Asam has clear pol-
itical overtones, such Questions as the role of
political authority in dealing with violence,
the tactic of non-violence as a political
means and dealing with non-violence on the
part of the political authority come to mind.
What is the place of non-violence in a world

that has become intolerably violent in recent
decades? .

Between 1960 and 1980, violence and war
have claimed lO‘million human lives. What
are the chances of a Gandhi in Hitler's Ger-
many or in El Salvador? I know of one inci-
dent in a country that will go unnamed for
obvious reasons in which university students
went on a hunger strike to protest the
oppressive measures of the government.
When the police came in on the fifth day,
they literally hurled the famished students
out and then shot one of them in the leg.
These students were following Gandhian
techniques all right, but the authority was
not the British Raj.

There are countries in the present world
where governments " are waging violence
against their own population; in others,
governments are ignoring or condoning vio-
lence or are plainly incapable of quelling it.
In other words, the governments are either
responsible for the sin of commission or of
ommission. In either case, the tragedy in
terms of loss of human lives is escalating.

Something must be done now to stop the

quotidian routine of violence.

regard to other types of medical services. It is

ludicrous for anyone to assert that a 13-year" '

old, for instance, is‘ competent to make
serious decisions about her medical treat-
ment just because she happens to be sexually

active. How can one justify a blanket remo- ,

val of parents’ rights and responsibilities for
making decisions about their child’s overall
medical care?

You may be sure that if and when a young

girl suffers either physical or emotional com- ,

plications from these harmful prescription

‘ drugs and devices that parental consent will

be necessary before the girl can be treated in
a doctor’s office or in an emergency room.
Then the previously uninformed parents will
be called in to pick up the pieces—andl pay
the bills!

p Thomas Kane’s lecture, “How
We Argue About The Soviet
Union,” on Tuesday questioned

— the rational rhetoric of the Uni-

ted States in dealing with the
Soviet government and people.

The main point of Kane’s lec-
ture _was that the majority of
Americans tend to base their
beliefs and arguments about the
Soviet Union on McCarthy-like
preconceptions.

Kane, who served as an escort
to both the Russian and Ameri-
can college students when they
debated in each other’s respec-
tive countries, pointed out the
different aspects of the students’

» questions to each other. e

The Pitt News, -Wednesday, March 9, 1983

“The visiting Russian students
were often addressed with ques-
tions like: ‘Do you get to travel
much in Russia?’ or ‘How long
have you known about Western
Civilization?’ Kane said.

According to Kane, one stu-
dent from Stanford University
asked a Russian debater how
America is to trust the Soviet
Union when they have broken
every pact they have made.

“The Russian student

resonded by asking the Ameri—.

can student to name one pact the
Russians had broken,” Kane
said. “Although he might. have
mentioned Helsinki, the Ameri-
can student was speechless. And
these students are supposed to
make up the elite of the Ameri-
can educational system.”

Ils America’ Ignorant Or Red?

Kane went on to mention the
devastation-of the Soviet main-
land as well as the staggering sta-
tistics of dead and wounded that
resulted from World War II. He
reminded the audience that the
brilliant and heroic defense by
the Soviet Union gave the West-'
ern Allies valuable time to pre-
pare for the invasion of
France—creating a second front.

This-example revealed how lit-
tle Americans know about the
Soviet people and its culture,
Kane said.

He urged that it is time to stop
judging the Soviet Union with
naive cliches and start educating
American students about the real
Russia.

“From this we can make our
own opinions based on facts
rather than prejudices,” Kane
said.

Dance-A-Thon To

Benifit Arthritis 4

The fifth annual Dance-a-thon
will take place this Friday and Sat-
urday night at Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial. -

The Dance-a-thon is a part of the
1983 Greek Week festivities and will
beneﬁt the Arthritis Foundation.

According to Steve Marks, chair-
man of the Dance-a-thon, “We hope
to raise $12,000 this year in the
Dance-a-thon and our eventual goal

is to raise $50,000 during Greek
. Week.” ‘’

The charity money will go directly
to arthritis research at Pitt, Marks
said. i

As of now, there are 53 couples
entered in the 24-hour marathon.

. Each couple is required to raise $125

in order to participate.'Any couple
can enter, independent or greek, if
this $125 entrance fee is met.

“The competition between the
sororities and fraternities is a lot
more ﬁerce this year,” Marks said.

'‘In order to get maximurnpoints for
Greek Week competition, each

house must have four couples’

entered."

Of the'24 hours of the Dance-a-
thon, the couples will dance 20 hours
with four hours of breaks. To help
keep the dancers’ spirits up, friends
can dance with the participants for a‘
50 cent donation.

And if the couples drop out before
the 16th-hour period? Well, the
money stays, but the points vanish.

A dancer whose partner has
“discoed—out” can still keep his
points if he finds another eligible
partner.

McDonald’s is
Dance-a-thon with hamburgers and
Egg McMuffins. B94, WDVE and
WYDD will be spinning the records
for the Dance-a-thon.

’ Every participant will receive a
dance-a-thon T—shirt even if he
doesn’t complete the marathon.

' a 77 percent cut, which would
eliminate four of the five pro-
grams that currently serve
493,000 students in 1,137
programs. '

OThe National Direct Student
Loan program would not receive
any new federal money under the
budget. The $550 million left in
the campus revolving funds
would still be available for loans,
but since no new funds will -be
available, those students who

most need the lower-interest loan
will not be able to obtain them.

0Two major changes are also
being proposed for the Guaran-
teed Student Loan program
affecting both the ability of stu-
dents to obtain a loan and the

become a totally “need-tested”

would be increased to 10 percent '
for graduate students.

national groups promised to
keep lobbying representatives to
stop the budget proposal from

”Cults can affect those stu-
dents who are in a period of
questioning-—duri‘ng the
reformulation . of self-
evaluation,” according to
Rabbi Joseph Levine, director
of the B’nai B’rith Hillel Foun-

‘ dation of Pittsburgh.

Levine, who counsels stu-
dents and families involved
with cults, explained that col- '
lege students are vulnerable to
cults because they are going
through developmental crises
and are redefining themselves.

They are also learning how
to cope with being away from
their parents, how torelate to
authority to accept the fact
that they will soon be in the V
work force.

It is a time of change, and
some students find that they
cannot - handle this period
alone. Theseare the students
who are most attracted to
cults. I

”The existence of cults in
this area is sporadic,” Levine
said. ”They tend to make
appearances during differing
times, for instance, during
holidays.

"Freshmen are the most
vulnerable, it seems,_ because
they are awayfrom home for
the first time.”

New literature dealing with
cults and who is the most sus-
ceptible to them is surprising,
he said. ‘

Elderly immigrants who are

in a new country, can't speak .
the language and are alone
often turn to cults, looking for_
friendship and understanding.
”Take a 60- or 70-year-old
Russian immigrant who is in a
strange environment. She,
who doesn't know whether
herhusband can get a job and
can't communicate with those
around her, will look for some
sort of organization that seems
to want to help her. This is
why people join cults and are
taken in by these groups,”
Levine said.
He explained that handi-
capped people—deaf, blind or
crippled——are also highly" sus-
ceptible to cults.

The most affected groups
are students in junior high and
high school. They are young
and very impressionable, and
they will listen_ to‘ cult
members more readily. How-
ever, age is not the most
important factor.

”Cults can affect people .of
any age. It depends more on
the personality profile than
what age the person is or what
nationality the person is. Cults
look for those people who

' seem lost to themselves, who

can't seem to determine what
is right for them,” Levine said.
According to Levine, there is
some trouble in defining a cult
because the word cult carries

_ many connotations.

Many people believe that
any specific organization can
be considered a cult because it
affects certain people—for .
instance, the First Unification
Church, which states strongly
that it is not a cult.

”To have a cult, the
members must be centered
around a blind authority, they
must have an undying obe-
dience to their "leaders," he
said. .

  Cults

”In cults, there is a sacrifice
of individuality—the members
are no longer involved in their
own decision making. Also,
uniformity is the key. Ev-
eryone marches to the same
drummer in cults.”

Although religion is some-
times felt to be such a strong
influence in some people's lives
that it takes over their person-

ality, this_is only due to the per- _

son himself. Levine said.
“Mainline religions”—
Christianity, Judaism, and
Protestanism—-work -within
the university_context.

These religions teach loyalty
and social consciousness, but
do not take people away from
their families and make them.

I undying followers.”

When students go to Levine
for help—for instance, if
they've been approached by a
cult and feel. somewhat
drawn—he -suggests that they
seek help quickly. C

He tells them to go to their .
family, clergy or even a faculty _

member for help.

”I’ve had students approach
me. about being drawn by cult
members," he‘said. ”First, I
have to see how deep the
waters run; and then if I don't
feel I can give -them the help
they need, I send them to a
psychiatrist.”

Levine has spoken to many
parents whose children have
been taken away by cults.

”Students have been taken
away and return in a stupor or
daze," he said. ”Parents are
fearful of never getting their

. children back, and I just help

them to realize that their chil-
dren can be returned. There
are national organizations

which help parents find their ‘

cult—imprisoned children.”

"Fiveto 10 percent of all col-
lege students flirt with the idea’
of a cult, but only 2 percent
ever pursue it further, accord-

- ing to Levine.

Cults generally approach
college students by a technique
such as handing out pamphlets
announcing a hayride or barn
party. Those students who
seem interested will be further
approached. . »

Levine strongly urges any
students who ‘are lonely or
depressed and have been
approached by a cult to seek
help from a trustworthy
friend, chaplin or anyone in the
Counseling Center.

In an era of radical religious
movements, cutls remain a phe-
nomenon about which the -aver-
age person knows very little.
There are various opinions on
what constitutes a cult; and an air
of mystery surrounds those who
belong to cults.

According to professor Fred
Clothey of the religious studies
department, a cult is distinguished
from religious sects and factions
by two characteristics:

0 a ritual, in which things are
:-done over and over in a certain
way. I

0 a charismatic leader.

There are about 2000 religious A

movements in the country now,
some of which are considered
cults. Some of these -movements
have adapted their ideas . from
Asia, and some are_ purely West-
ern in ideology.

One can characterize certain
patterns that are generally found
in those who belong to cult move-
ments, Clothey said:

0 a need for a near-mystical
”spiritual experience." Clothey
said that this need is sometimes
brought about by one's alienation
of social values or involvement
with drugs.

0 a search for a heroic figure,
someone who provides spiritual
fulfillment inside and can defy
society's conventions. '

”I suppose that people respond
to these figures because they are
looking for a role model of sorts,”
Clothey said.

 

U a quest for a belief system,
which usually exists within a cult.
’ The belief system can be very gen-
eral and fundamental, or it can be

specific, where there is an author- I

itative scripture andlor divine fig-
ure who is able to help and save
-you.
’’These views are fairly attrac-
tive for those with a low self-
image," Clothey said, ”and for
‘those. who need a basis for their
current beliefs.”
0 a desire to be in a community

‘where there is a sense of being

accepted, which is also often
found in cults. Clothey said that
he believes some of this stems
from loneliness.

”I guess this says something
about the lack of community peo-
ple feel in real life," he said.

0 a quest for ”pseudo-science”
which has the scientific language
to make a ”run-around science."

. Talk about UFOs, black holes

, and other supernatural pheno- »

mena gives a view of the universe
that, according to Clothey, is not
necessarily accurate but main-
tains that ”we are one jump ahead A
of science.” ‘ .

0 patterns and consistency,
which give a sense of identity and
a chance for transformation—to
be.somebody_ else within the cult.

"One of the things that comes
through as being as important as

 jan’y.thinsi.¢SPf€Cia1.1yin these c(>n- 

ck Power’ is taught in the window. of Eck shop.

for a ritual that works," Clothey
said. -_

_It.is not easy to draw a line. that
distinguishes between what is and

’ what is not a cult. Some immi-

grants who bring their religions to
the United States are mistakenly
taken for cult members, and there
are some sectsjof organized reli-
gions that are considered cults by
some. .

"Certainly within Christianity,
you have your Jesus freaks and

other sorts.of things,” Clothey
said. ' ‘

Some relaxation groups, such as
transcendental mediation and
yoga, are also sometimes consi-
dered to be cults.

Counting these groups in the

category of cults, evidence sug-

gests that at leastsix percent of
they U.S. population‘ belongs to a
group that can be considered a
cult. . ~

Clothey attributes the amount
of people in cults to an ignorance

‘of organized "religion. Americans

have had enough Sunday school,
he said, but have not done enough
serious thinking about religion.

"Particularly young people are
attracted to these movements—in
part, because there is a certain nai-
vete, Americans‘ are under-
educated in_terms of religion,” he
said. .

On_ the other hand, Professor

   

Seezox photo

Roland Robertson of the sociology
department said that it is not a
lack of religious though but too

much religion, that drives young

people to join cults.

”It's very disturbing for parents _

who . care very much for their
children to see them cut them-
selves off," Robertson said. ’’But
this is aicountry in which parents
encourage children to ;become
very religious. Maybe this is the
"price they pay.”

Robertson admits that cults are
often made as attractive as possi-
ble to recruit members for the
personal gain of the leaders. _

The mass suicide of over 1000
members of the People's Temple
in Jonestown, "Guyana, illustrates
a cult in which the leader was try-
ing to accumulate as much wealth

and power as possible.‘

”There’s no doubt that lots of
people are interested in making
money and achieving fame and
personal satisfaction in having
control over the lives of people,”.
Robertson said.

”Jonestown is certainly a good
example of the exploitative side of
religion—but religion has always
involved a sort of exploitation.

”Americans can't have it both
ways. If religion is so important to
them, they can't be_ surprised if
things go wrong sometimes."

through the process of brain-
washing. Recently, it has become
possible for parents to reclaim
their children from cults and
retrain them, or deprogram them,

‘,©back to everyday life. ~
‘  According t_o Robertson, there

_is not much of a difference
between brainwashing an
deprogramming. '
"[Brainwashing] is a very con-
troversial term,” he said. ”It car-
ries the connotations of Stalin,
Hitler and what was done- to
Americans in the Korean War. '
"The people who do it don't call
it brainwashing—-they call it de-
programming. They have a polite
word for it. They're not doing

those nasty things that Hitler and"

Stalin did.".
‘ In some cases, ‘brainwashing

Cults in

I said that cults reflect some of
what's lacking in modern society,‘

and that Americans will have to
get used to the presence of cults
.whether they like it or not.

”The presence of these'—move-
ments does have a number of
implications for American society

now," Clothey said. "In some’

ways, they reflect some of the reli-
gious and say, these are some of
the things we have been missing
from religion and we ‘are finding
them here. -

”It is, of course, a kind of reflec-
tion of social patterns ‘ in
America-changing values,
mobility, sometimes alienation

' from families." -

Clothey said that some move-
ments may fade after their leader
dies but the religious landscape in
America will never be the same.

Robertson said that while cults
present uncomfortable shot-run
implications, Americans will be
able to adapt to their presence in
society in the ‘long -run.

J gion is so important to them, they can't be

, body to a motel,'don’t let him sleep

for many days and harangue him
about his obligations to America,
his parents, his brothers, his sis-
ters, his pets...,” Robertson said.

‘ "In the long run, this will- be part
of the phenomenon people get

run, it's going to be very upsetting
to parents, but. we've been
through phases like this before.
American religious history is full
of what seems _to ‘be odd

For example, there were ques-
tions about the Mormons in the
beginning of the century. Further
back,- Americans were worried
about theincreasing number of
Jews and Catholics -who were

entering the country.‘

few more religious movements,"

Although religious cults are not

as visible on the East Coast as they ‘
are on the other side of the coun- v

try, there are several that practice
here, including the Unification
Church (or ."Moonies), Hare
Krishna, Eckankar and the Hima-
layan Institute for Yoga-

One of the largest and most

' financially successfulcults-is the

Unification Church, founded» by
the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, an
immigrant from South Korea.

Not much is heard these days of ~

Moon, the man who compared
himself to Jesus Christ and
pointed to himself asthe ”second
Adam." However, angry parents,
upset over their children's accept-
ance of the unorthodox life style
of the Unification Church, are
ever-aware of Moon's presence.
One such mother, Mrs. Ward,
works for Pennsylvanians for
Individual Freedom (PAIF), the
largest organization on the East
Coast dealing with cults. Her son
became involved in the Unifica-

' tion Church. -
"He was a graduate ofNotre

Dame, Phi Beta Kappa, and was
attending the Sorbonne in Paris at
the time of his initial involve-
ment," she said. ”He was the type
who was against the establish-
ment. He was very bright and
could speak five languages."
Ward gave a brief description of

~ the techniques used to get her son

and others interested in joining
the group. '

"It’s usually from a random‘
meeting in the street,” she said.
”The newly met are invited to
some .meetings that are held
locally, and they begin to break
down your weak points. ’I don't
know what's happened to my son.
I never hear from him."

The material gains from his dis-
ciples have enabled Moon to pub-
lish a newspaper in Washington,
D.C.—'The Washington Times, start a
fishing business in Gloucester and
develop a company that markets
ginseng tea through-a health food
chain. ~

Moon's doctrines may be unor-

‘ thodox, but his methods of reach-

ing people and establishing
credibility with the public have
gained him some social standing.

Every year around Thanksgiv-‘

ing he holds a conference on scien-
tific advances. The International
Conference on Unity in the Scien-
ces gathers eminent scientists
from aroundgthe world, and their
expenses, are paid—including
stays at luxury hotels.

Conferences such as these are
one reason why many people,
including clergymen, do not take
the trouble to question Moon's
actions and his philosophies.

A Catholic professor at Ford-
ham University replied to a letter
of Ward's concerning the confer-
ence, "If you had a chance to study
for a cure for cancer in Russia,
wouldn't you go?”

Another way that Moon has of
reaching students is through
CARP-—Collegiate Association
for Related Principles—an off-
shoot of the Unification Church
which advertises trips for stu-
dents to Florida and Colorado
each year for Christmas and
Easter.

It is questionable whether
Moon's group should be called a
religion. But one cult, the Hare
Krishnas—the Movement for
Awareness of Krishna Conscious-
ness-——has successfully combined

teachings of Hinduism, one of the _g
st 9re.Iig'i9r;1$ [in'..th'e..‘w;0.'.r.1d{. éhd

’E'aste‘rn= m'vsticism.7..'

__home

A man named Propapod came to
the United States from India in
the early 1960s to spread his
teachings of combined branches
of Hinduism.-

Hare Krishnas believe in rein-
carnation and that there is always
a spiritual Incarnation—a person
is surrounded at all times by this
spiritual leader.

Mike was in the Army at the
time he became involved in Hare
Krishna. He had been a musician
in high school and later joined the
Army for financial support. He
became bored with‘ his time in the
military. '

It was while walking though the
Atlanta airport that he came into
contact with a fellow who also had
an interest in music and a "1000-

_watt smile." The person devel-
oped a rapport with Mike and

invited him to a weekend in Nash-

- ville on a Krishna farm.

"They wined and dined him,”
said his mother, Arlene.

”They eventually convinced
him that what-he was ‘doing was
demonic. They told him that the
Army was a demonic organ-

ization—‘a bunch of murderers,q

even though there was no war
going on at the time," she said.
The Krishnas believe that the
United States and all symbols of
authority are demonic since they
do not have the "consciousness of
Krishna”-a sense of God.
"They talked my son into going
A.W.O.L. from the military and
even obtained an honorable dis-
charge for him,” Arlene said.
Presently, Krishna groups are
not allowed to solicit in airports
like Atlanta, where Mike met the
devotee who got him involved.

However, they do run businesses ’

and desire to have more control in
society. _ -- .
”They have gone underground
a bit," Arlene said. ”They wear
wigs and streetclothes and chant
in the streets. They have booths in
malls where they sell art work.
They also make money from the
sale of records and liter.ature'.'_'
The Krishnas also want to con-
trol political circles and ran a can-
didate for mayor of Atlanta.
Though they have goals in mind
similar to those of Sun Mvung

A Moon, they have had a drop in

membership. This could be due to
the death of the original leader,

. Propopod;

The current leader is Keith
Hamm from Brooklyn who works
out of their Golden Temple in
West Virginia. '

.'One question that Arlene and
her son Mike would like answered
is, ”Do the leaders of the cults like

Moon and Hamm truly believe .

what they preach or are they only
in for the money?”

Arlene described Keith Hamm
as being "spaced out” and looking
physically sick.

”It looks as if he truly suffers
from malnutrition, but how can

you tell if he believes in what he is ,

doing? You can't,” Arlene said.’
The Krishnas have a rigorous
schedule on their farms. They are

' often up at 3 a.m. and chant until

6, when they eat breakfast‘. Then
they are out all day in the street or
working in their fields.

They are required to take five or
six cold showers a day to ”ward off
evil spirits.” ‘

As a mother and a member of _

Pennsylvanians for Individual
Freedom, Arlene gave this advice
for anyone ever considering
joining: ' ' ‘

”Talk to a youth who has been
involved and been through their
life style. Call PAIF and investi-
gate. Many Krishnas get sent
since they become so
burned out, else they just sit on
the farms and stare. My son Mike
saw enough to know.”

Today, the Krishnas are not as
active around the Pitt campus,
partially due to the work of
groups such as PAIF and other
agencies.

One group around campus
which has differentiated itself
from other religions, cults and
groups by way of doctrine is Eck-
ankar, headed by Harold Klemp,
who believes that soul travel and
the ”inner temple" is the path to
the Spirit or Eck. Eckankar is an
Amdo word meaning "co-worker
with God.” 7 1

been with them for nine-years.

"I was looking for truth,” she
explained. "All my life I was look-
ing for greater understanding. I
wasn't looking for a guru.”

Eckists believe in five levels of
consciousness: astral, causal,
mental, self-realizationjand
unfolding into god-consciousness.

One gets to the first level by
studying the material and teach-
ings of Echankar.

' Initiations aregiven at each of
thevfive‘ levels, and as Joan said,
"Spirit manifests itself as light and
sound.”

During the time of initiation,
the master has the opportunity of
being with the "che la," or initiate,
at all times.

Eckankar was founded in 1965
by Paul Twitchell, who gave a talk
to three_ladies in Las Vegas. Twit-
chell’s original audience of three
has now grown into a worldwide
membership of over three million
Eckists. There are over 400 in
Western Pennsylvania. Eckankar
does have over 100 students
involved, but the group generally
attracts those who have recently
graduated and who are just start-
ing a career.

Paul Twitchell died in 1971 and
passed the leadership to Darwin
Gross, who has lectured and writ-

ten extensively on Eckankar.

"These men have reached the
God-conscious state," said" Joan,
”but we are not a cult since there is
no outward from of worship of an
Eck master." »

"During the study for the
second level Eckists are not
allowed to question or doubt the
teachings of the Eck master,”

Mary said.’ .
In his book, ”Your Right To
Know," Darwin Gross said,

"There should be no explanations
demanded of the living Eck Mas-
ter, including those Eck Masters
working from the seven Golden
Wisdom Temples." I

Joan, who teaches a class for
Eckankar, said that it is "one big
spiritual adventure."

It is the physical rather than
spiritual body which is the focus
of the Himalayan Institute for.
Yoga and Philosophy of Science.

"We are concerned about public
education,” said Pat Layton, who
teaches a yoga class at the Jewish
Community Center in Oakland.

She became involved through
her interest in yoga when Swami
Rhamma came from India to lec-
ture in Sewickley, Pa.

Layton lived with the Swami
and others in a yoga center in Bel-
levue and has been with the Hima-
layan Institute in Oakland since
last September.

Goals for the Pittsburgh branch 1

are to teach techniques for indi-
vidual growth and make known

the SVwami's views on religion and.

philosophy, from a scientific basis.
Al Diorio is the director-of the
Oakland center. He holds a Ph.D.
in Biochemistry and he works at
Allegheny General Hospital. A
"I'm interested in science—no
goofy stuff," he said.
The Institute has done work

with bio-feedback and nutrition at —

their center in Honesdale, Pa.,,

where they also hold conferences .

on diet and yoga.

The Himalayan Institute, which
has a center on South Craig Street
along with a bookstore and health
food store, is listed by the Penn-
sylvanians for Individual Freedom
as a cult. .

"We are not,[a cult]” Diorio
said. "Some of my colleagues at
work wonder, but yoga is not a
religion. We look for people who
want to work with themselves,

those who are willing to be _

trained."
The "spiritual" founder, Swami
Rhamma, was raised by the sages

' ‘in India since.the age of three.

'"He' gathered these people,"
Diorio said, ”and makes it work.

For themajority of this season,
Panther basketball head coach Roy
Chipman moaned about facing the
giants of ‘the Big East, always com-
menting on the superiority‘ of talent
Villanova, Boston College, etc. had

 ﬁgver Pitt; . , _
-. " But Chipman did not radiate hlS.'
usual pessimistic vibes during Mon- -

day’s press conference. _ ~
“We can give them a good game,”

he said. “If we do that, anything can

happen.” '

And that may be the_plan for the 0

Panthers“ as they ‘face St. J ohn’s
tomorrow at one o'clock at Madison
Square Garden—stay close with the

Redmen and hopefully pull off the ‘

upset late in the game.
"We stand as good as a chance as

any to upset St.’ John’s” Chipman

said. “We know what to do to beat
them.” ‘

. _ - The key to the 72-71 upset victory

v:mver"St. John’s in early February

7 was controlling the tempo. Pitt

0  played its type of*game—usingavar-

. iety of defenses and being patient on

offense—and kept close ‘with the

Redmen before pulling the game in’

W the final 10 minutes.

But the Redmen were ready for
the rematch at Alumni Hall. Taking
a big lead early, St. J ohn's coasted to
an easy 91-73 victory last Saturday
despite a career-high 31 points by
Panther forward Clyde Vaughan.

“They were as emotionally high as
I've ever seen them,” Chipman said.
“They usually came in at a! poor
atmosphere.”

 One thing that may be to 'Pitt’s_ P ”

sﬂgéﬁtdvantage is the lopsided loss.

“They may feelcocky over beating
us by l.8 points,” Chipman said. “We
have to prove that St. John’s' is not
18 points better than us.”

It may help the Panthers that the
games are back to back.

“It could be to our advantage to
play them back to back," Chipman ’

said. “They feel that they can handle
us.”

“Actually, we didn’t play badly in
the second half. We got the lead
down to ll points, but we couldn’t
get over the hump. It was just like
the Syracuse game up there.”

The same formula‘ that heldtrue
in the earlier upset at the Fitzgerald
Field House should hold true in this

— -Cﬁfsmeeting.

“We have to control the break,
rebound and get good guard play,”
Chipman said."

Vaughan agreed with Chipman
on how to beat the Redmen but dis-

’ agreed on the choice of the favorite
in the tournament. The 6-4 junior
forward believes Boston College or
Villanova should ‘win the tourna-

ment, but the third-year head coach .

Wearing

“Shoes

By BARRY ZASLOFF

It seems that'Pitt coach Roy Chip- '
man lost a rather large shoe when his
Panthers joined the Big'East, the
same one that St. .John’s coach Lou
Carnesecca will be wearing tomor-
row afternoon when _the 10th-.
ranked Redmen host Pitt in the
opening round _of the league's post-
season tournament at Madison
Square Garden.

Pitt won the Eastern 8 tourna-
ment and advanced to the NCAA
shootouts the past two years, largely
because the tournament was played
in Pittsburgh. While Chipman has
already expounded on the differen-
ces between playing at the Fitzgerald
Field House and the Civic Arena,
_ll,000- quiet fans rooting is better
-than none at all—and it’s far super-
ior to about 15,000 spectators cheer- ‘
ing for the other team. This may
happen tomorrow in New York, -
home of the Redmen and land ofthe
intimidating crowds.

Chipman, and the Panthers have

Arena, home of the Duquesne
Dukes and second home of Pitt. But
now Carnesecca holds the shoe, _
while Chipman faces the unenviable
task of having to defeat St. John’s on -
its own court.

‘ And forget about the element of
surprise. Everyone knows Clyde
Vaughan and how Pitt pulled off its
first Big East upset against the Red-
men earlier this season. Everyone
knows that Pitt has a back history of
performing well in tournaments.

By MARK SINDLER ‘

It might be considered nostalgic
to look back, but the scene is worth

recalling. The date was February 12, _

and the occasion was the Pitt Volley-

‘ ball Invitational semi-final round

between York and Ohio State. The
match was hotly contested; York
was expected to take the Buckeyes in
three games, but Ohio State sur-
prised the Yeomen in four games.‘
During the match, there was an
obscured individual off to a far side,
sitting on the gym ﬂoor against the

wall in Trees Hall, his eyes taking in ._

every move of the semi-finals.

Setter Dave Baird was doing that
sunny Sunday morning what he has
done for his previous three years—
learning and taking cues from others
on the floor. That is how he has
become the Panthers’ playset’leader
this season and perhaps the most
dominating setter in the East.

The only senior on a freshman’-
dominated squad, Baird didn't
acquire his sharp skills overnight.

— Instead, he acquired them‘ after

hours of practicing, watching and
listening during the volleyball pro-

doesn’t know all that much about
setting, but he’s a good motivator
and what he knows he _teaches me
about setting and I just kind of-I
don’t know—l guess I pick up a lot
watching other players.”

1 Indeed, Baird has picked up so
much over the years that he now

occupies that position of role model. *

He is now the player to whom fresh-
men turn in seeking out advice.

Baird laughs away such thoughts.
“I hope not, for the guys’ sakes,” he
said. “No, I guess I am because I am
really the only guy on the team that
had anykind of experience, and I
have those goofy honors that eve-
rybody keeps writing about. '

“But I kind of like that role
because I like to be a leader. [enjoy
it.”

Those honors Baird has been
awarded did not come solely
through enjoyment. An intensely
competitive player, Baird has
already reeled in two consecutive
All-East honors" and should be a
shoo-in for a third this season.
Baird’s eye-catching style has also
afforded him appearances in ‘the
1982 Keystone State Games and in
the United States Volleyball Associ-
ation’s All-Region [Ohio Valley]
Team.

With all these awards, one might
surely imagine that Baird would be.

willing to serve as team captain. He
did last season but let middle hitter
Barry Goldberg take over the role
this year. Baird just wanted someone _
else to get the experience.

“Not that I didn't want it,” he said,
“but I knew I would be the court
captain. I’d be running the offense
and everything, and I just felt that it

would be better for someone else to

get involved in that.
“I think Barry is doing a goodjob

with it this year; he’s a lot» better at, «_
that because I was [captain] before; 1’ 7‘

and I wasn’t real crazy about it.”
Just the oppositeattitude is what
Baird has carried with him during
his volleyball-playing days in a
minor sport at a large university.
“I’ve really enjoyed what I’ve had
here, and I think that a lot of people
at the university treat me and the
program like we’re first-class,” Baird
said. “When we get that, I appreciate
it. It’s something that I think that we
really deserve, not being one of the
more popular sports.
“But I think that we work as hard
as anybody else around here.”
What upsets Baird is the lack of

recognition he receives in compari- ,, V
son to people in other programs. » £1}

The Panther football team lost
another assistant coach, when
offensive coordinator Joe
Daniels resigned Monday to take

Fazio named Northwestern’s
Ron Turner as quarterback
coach’ yesterday, a position

¢§i,_TIM DINGER.

When Panther wrestler Jeff Jelic
lands in Oklahoma City, he won't be
thinking about time zone changes,
seeding meetings, weigh-ins or who
is refereeing. He’ll only be thinking
about one thing——wrestling.‘

“With all of the things that are ’

going to be happening, l’ll still have

to remember what I’m there for,” he .
said. “People are .always saying-

‘Good Luck!’ and I guess there is a
certain amount of luck involved, but
in the end, how well I do depends on

 gw well I wrestle."

’ jelic won his second straight East-
‘ern Wrestling League (EWL) title
two weeks ago, earning- him his
second trip to the NCAA National

\ , tournament. J elic won the EWL title

by beating two wrestlers who had
defeated him earlier in the season:

Clarion’s Nate Carter in the semi-~ '
-V finals and. Lock Haven’s Doug'-

Buckwalter in the finals. If Jelic
plans-_to place at Nationals, he is
again going to have to beat several
wrestlersto whom he has lost earlier.

“I’ve lost to so.me people that I
should.not have lost to, and I’ve lost

I. The Pitt News, Wednesdaylvlarch 9', I983

to a few that I should have lost to,”
he said. “But I‘ve also beaten some
of the top-ranked wrestlers in the
nation, so it's going to be
interesting.”

Last year’s trip to Iowa State" for
Nationals sa_w Jelic miss All-
America honors by a single win, los-
ing' to Louisiana State’s Bill
Dykman in the consolations 7-4.

Wrestling coach Rande_Stottlem-
yer believes .lelic’s previous expe-
rience at Nationals will be a big plus
for him. ,

“Last year will help him a lot,” he
said. “He has conﬁdence now. He

knows what he has to do. He’s seen ‘

the officials and seen a lot of differ-
ent wrestlers, and he wasn’t that far
away from winning last year.

“He can be an All-America with a
minimal amount of luck. With a lot
of luck, who knows‘ how‘ far he can
go? It all comes down to whether or

‘not he can put it all togetherfor’

three days.” .

Because. of the numbers of‘wild-
card selections allowed for each
regional section, each weight class
could have 32-40 wrestlers, with
only the top 12 being seeded. Jelic

was ranked No. 4 ‘in 'pre-season
polls, at 150 lbs., but dropped out of
the top eight after he suffered losses
at 167 lbs. However, Stottlemyer
believes Jelic can still gain a seeded
position. ‘

“Last year he went in unseeded,
but this year, because of his record,
his second EWL title and the fact
that he has beaten some highly rated
wrestlers, he’ll likely pull out a low
seed,” he said. “But right now, we’re
not worried about seeding‘-—just
winning.” '

On the other hand, Jelic is not‘as
concerned about winning as he is
about performance. . '

“Winning, of course, is the ulti-

’ mate goal; that’s why every wrestler

is there for,"’,Jelic said. “But right.
now, the pressure is not on me to
win. I’m more concernedwith going
out there and doing my best. If I go

out there and wrestle the way I know,-;_ '
I can, then the winning will take care  ,

of itself.”

."‘He’s carrying the banner now for ' '

Pitt,” Stottlemyer said. “Hopefully,
he can carry it far.” _ _
The three-day tournament begins

"tomorrow and ends Saturday.

Karen Martin thrives on competi-
tion. As a member of the Lady A
Panther gymnastics team, her deter-
mination has not only paid off in the
gym, but scholastically as well.

Martin's performances this sea-
son have been the highlight of the
Lady Panther gymnastics team. She
has been a consistent all-around per-
former, averaging a score of 35.03. S"

Last term, Martin received
scholar-.athlete honors by achieving
a grade-point average of 3.87. Also,
she has been a dean’s list candidate
since her freshman year. -

Martin, from New Holland, Pa.,
started her gymnastics career when
she looked in on a summer camp
program. ,

“I was in first grade when I saw
‘this class. lmmediately, I was inter-
ested, but I was too young,”she said.
“I had to wait until I was in third
grade before they let me in the
\3 program.” ’

Martin progressed quickly. By the
fourth grade, she was on a private,

club team, and in sixth grade, she
took first place in United States
Gymnastics Federation state com-
petition. She was also a member of
the Pennsylvania, state team, which
took first ' at state
competition. ,_

In high school, Martin took a rest
from private club gymnastics, com-
peting for her school instead. This
transition enabled ,her to excel in
other sports such as field hockey,
track and volleyball.

“Club gymnastics is intense, and
you tend to miss out on a lot,” she
said. “I enjoyed competing for my
high school, and I feel that when it
was time to go to college, I wasn’t
burned out from the intense compe-
tition of club gymnastics."

Martin was offered a full scholar-
ship from Pitt, and although it
wouid be a big adjustment—a rural
gir1’s coming to the city, she thought
Pitt, would be able, to offer he’1§(;),‘7"

believes that gymnastics has given

This has a tendency of wearing us
down.”

This shows still another difference
between Pitt in the Big East and Pitt
in the Eastern 8. In the past two
years under Chipman, where the
Panthers won-the Eastern 8 title in
two consecutive years, the team was
reaching its peak right at tourna-

 time. Now, Pitt may have

' reached its high point several weeks
ago, at which time the Panthers
defeated St. John’s Syracuse and
Georgetown.

“In the Eastern_8, we were fresh
both physically and mentally during
this time,” Chipman said. “We were
always sharp.”

. “But not this year. We are a very
tired team. We were ourselves out
with the string of upsets. We don’t
‘ have a lot of pep.”

This is due to the lack of help the
Panthers have been receiving.

“I feel that any athlete has a jump

athlete is faced with experiences and .

Vaughan has carried Pitt most of
this season; he has lead in scoring 24
games and in rebounding 19 times.
Some players took the load off
Vaughan during the streak, but they

are also worn out.

“Both Billy Culbertson and Trent .

Johnson are very tired,” Chipman
said. “This is a compliment to the‘
league. The Big East is a very
demanding league.”

However, neither Chipman nor
Vaughan is disappointed with the
season.

“We were happy to win six games
in the conference," Chipman said.

“We have to do a better job in the

future recruiting and prepare for
games differently.” -

“I feel better with a .500 mark in
the Big East than I did in the Eastern
8,” Vaughan said. “I had to work
harder this year than last ‘year
because the players are so much

better.”

she said. ' ~

Martin hopes to place high at the
Regional all-around competition.
Her ultimate goal is to qualify for
Nationals. “ '

‘‘It is just a matter of keeping my
scores high and performing consis-
tently,” she said.

Karen Martin should have no
problem. She not only possesses the
athletic ability, but she has the deter-

mination’ and confidence to achieve

success in gymnastics.

Success can not be measured by
the won-lost record but by improve-
merit. The Panthers have upgraded
their,program. An upset over St.
John s tomorrow would enhance
this improveme_nt.

PITT NOTES: Vaughan wrapped
up his second ‘consecutive league-
scoring title. Last season, he led the
Eastern 8 during the regular season.
His 22- pointsper game was the
second highest seasonal average in

approached him but admitted that
he was ‘highly recruited.

His playing career began during
his ninth grade year after he found
that baseball was not to his liking.
Coach Dan Napolitano was coach-
ing a young team back then, similar
to the current Panther squad that
has six freshmen on a 10-man roster.

“Yeah, it was a young [program],”
Baird said, “kind of like Pitt’s right
now. But they had ‘an assistant
coach; he was young and he knew all

I the new techniques, so it was kind of

interesting.”

What Baird did after high school
was also different; he worked at a
steel mill for a year. Seems that
Baird wasn’t ready to decide on what
he wanted to do with his life and
“didn’t want to waste my parents
money in college.”

When Baird did start mapping out
his career goals, he picked Pitt

because it had a young program at
the time. However, young doesn’t
exactly describe it correctly. The
volleyball program was starting only
its second full year when Baird
arrived. ’ »

“When I was a freshman, it was
like I came _in and we had a pretty big
freshmen class, kind of like this
year's team,” Baird said. “It was dif-
ferent from being out a year, plus it
was a lot faster paced than what I
had_ been used to playing in high

school—iti was at. a much higher
level." - .

Baird first approached Pitt with
the intention of receiving an educa-
tion. Ironically, he thought he was
just an outside shot when he walked
on.

What helped Baird that first year
was Pitt's playing only at the Div-
lS10n II level, and accordingly, the
level of competition wasn’t quite as
strong.
