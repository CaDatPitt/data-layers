SC Revises
Appointing

Procedures

Any student interested in becom-
inga member of any of Student Con-
gress's standing committees will
have a chance to submit a formal
application under a new "system in-
augurated by Howard Greenberger,
the new president.

In the past committee chairmen,
elected by Student Congress from
its own members, appointed the com-
mittee members. Naturally enough,
they chose, members from their ac-
quaintances.

Under the new method, the chair-
men will choose his aides from stu-
dents who file applications, a revi-
sion of policy which should give
better representation and help to in-
sure active participation by the mem-

'bers. ‘ ,

These applications may be ob.‘-
tained from Miss Thomas in the
dean of men’s office and should be
filled out and returned before Fri-
day, May 19.

The four standing committees
are appointments, social, assembly,
and publicity.

The appointments committee in-
terviews and appoints members to
all Congress sponsored posts.

The socialicommittee sets up
the program of social events and

advises the special social com-
mittees. They check applications
for affairs and enforce fines for

violations of school social rules.

All student rallies, assemblies,
and the movie program are handled
by the assembly committee.

The publicity committee helps
dance committees, investigates
new channels for publicizing Con-
gress-sponsored events, and co-
ordinates publicity for all affairs.

Women Slate
Mother’s Tea

Over five hundred guests are ex-
pected at the annual Mother's Tea
which is sponsored by the women’s
classes of the University. The tea

rial Hall.

Peggy Cochrane, chief-justice
of Senior Court, will welcome the
mothers. Esther Jacobson a mem-
ber of Women’s Speech Guild will
be assisted‘ by Arlene Levinson at
the harp. Helen P. Rush, dean of
women, will Speak to the mothers.

In the receiving line will be the
presidents of the four classes,
Betty McKay, Class of ’53; Mary

Monday; Theme Isl,
"Childhood Daze”  

By GEORGE BARBOUR . . A.

Quality points will probably be forgotten while campus gaiety
and school spirit rise to an all-semester high when Spring Festi- 3
val, the annual week ‘of fun, begins Monday, May "15-. ' I

Activities in which only a childlike mind is required will’-
probably dry up any deep thrist for knowledge and education, 

Frat men line up for the IF Pushllidbile
Race which will start from the Westinghouse Memorial and terminate at
the Schenley Park fountain on Monday morning. The winners will be
awarded points toward the IF Trophy. The race has been nicknamed the

"Duck Gambol” by Spring Festival officials. (see story, page 7)

SF Publicity
Stunt Slated

The I special Spring Festival
publicity stunt, postponed last Wed-
nesday because of bad weather, is
scheduled for this afternoon from
12:30 to 1:30 p.m. on the Cathedral
lawn.

At that time, the ROTC will drill
and eight huge helium-filled bal-
loons are to be launched.

The balloons have various fea-
tures of Pitt’s annual Spring Festi-
val printed on them and also a letter
scotch-taped on them. The letter
grants two tickets to the Make“-Be-
lieve ball tothe balloon’s finder.

After the ROTC troops under
Col. John I.-Hincke have passed in
review, eight girls dressed in shorts
will cut the mooring strings of the

balloons. These girls represent the
various committees who have plan-

ned Spring Festival activities.

“Belie5ve in love at first sight?”

uddling Through May

May is the month most people eagerly await. The weather's on
E the mend -- and it’s going to get better, they know. But for the
(majority of Pitt students, or most any college students for that
matter, May is probably the worst month on the calendar. ‘Every-
,thing has piled up into one tangled log-jam. _' T ‘V
’ Tap Day, year-end meetings and dinner, Spring Festival fall
. one after another this month on the social docket. The Pirates are
in town. Golf and tennis players come after you. "Simultaneous
jjwith these comes the realization that the semester's school work
has amassed into a staggering load with the time to dispose of it
running out -- for seniors sooner ‘than they think. —
Breaking up of the jam seems hopeless. Yet somehow most of
(guts do it. _'A few seniors don’t get that sheepskin. A larger group
of undergraduates receive "not permitted to register’s” in the
_ mail during the summer.But most of us make it, how we can’t tell
now not figure out how we did it later. ' A

In our years at the University we have heard the experiences
.'0f many students who have managed to. wade through the ordeal.
7lLumping together their stories, we'll offer to you, for what it’s
*worth, a rather loose, totally unproven formula. '

‘The trick seems to be not a stubborn defiance of every un-
«necessary conflict with the books, but utilization of the time when
I something doesn't appear on your schedule, besides studies, that
you really want to do. ’

If you have your mind set on seeing the Pirates play the Phils
at Forbes Field, go see them. "If you want to attend that honorary
‘ffraternity dinner, dress up and go. "But, if you’re in your study
room, with nothing to do that’s particularly important to you, exer-
1 cise that will power and open that history book. In this kind of
)7 weather, it’s a matter of mind over “the great outdoors.” That's
(what you have to resist, the laziness the spring tries to infuse

into you.‘ i

I This is a simple solution to a rather big problem of most of us.
Some will easily shut themselves off from everything except the
;,books. ‘Maybe they'll miss some other things they shouldn't, but
they’re surer than everybody else of getting through the semester
with the grades they want. Others might try our scheme and flunk.
For the average student with some cravings beyond the field
{of learning, though, we think this is a formula that can work and
flat the same time is the easiest approach to take. ‘

Postcard Blues 

 

Boy, have we hit the big time!

The sign of approvalof coming to age has been placed upon
our brow. For the University of Pittsburgh has been made the sub-
ject of a letter-booklet for busy men and "having a wonderful time

-- wish you were here"
This is a clever gimmick.
., It’s abooklet about the University
placed in a cover which looks like
an envelope.
The booklet is written in guide
book fashion from the point“‘of view of

‘ the first person, just like _a letter.

But a dry guide book it is not, for
the authorhas spiced'.it up with such
profound prose as "I liked the Scot-
tish Room.”
Never Any People

And of course there are a profuse
amount of excellent photos of the
Commons Room (empty of course,)
the Nationality Rooms (equally under-
populated,) and the Heinz Chapel
(both exterior and interior.) (You

like it. The different groups should

Anne Adams, College 51: "A

see someone you don’t have to rove
over 37 floors in hot pursuit.”

Betty McKay. College 53: "A
large number of non-members of
sororities and fraternities feel out
of place in the Blue Tuck shop
among a group of organized stu-
dents. This fault may lie with
either group.”'

Dick Cunningham, College '50:
“A rotation system might be work-
ed out with advantage to the frater-
nities.”

Harry Mavrinac, Graduate stu-
dent: "That's why I eat in the Red
Tuck Shop. Because of the limited
facilities here, there should be no
unwritten law that certain groups
monopolize certain booths. It often
happens that students will walk
around the Blue Tuck with a heavy
tray, while fraternity members just
sit and talk.” 

Bernice Gottschalk, Education

A Vet Replies

pletely destroys the effect.)

The first page of our “Letter from
the University of Pittsburgh” is
blank——or nearly blank. A line of
print at the bottom explains that
this space is for your own personal
letter.

The publishers even start you off.
Up at the top of the page is a date-
line with the "19” already printed L
in. This is so that you will not for-’
get that this is the 20th century after
walking through the Commons Room,
which according to our author places
one “in an atmosphere 900 years

old.”

But to continue.

Eagerly opening the printed "let-
ter,” we feast our eyes upon "This
is higher education in the truest
sense of the word.” (No comment)

Complicated Statement

One paragraph below we read,
"The towering Cathedral of Learning
is high.” (Parse to allow this to
sink in.)

Let us now enter the Cathedral.
"I entered the magnificent skyscraper
to find myself in an atmosphere 900
years old. . . Iwas immediatelyjerked
back into the Twentieth Century,
however, by the presence of the well-

ssed young men and women who
passed me carrying books and bin-
ders. (Don’t feel sad, I don’t know
what a binder is either.)

And to close this paragraph, we
have a gem to warm -a Freshman
English teacher’s heart, "The set-
ting was Gothic, but this was young
America.” (Do you, too, feel a lump
in your throat.)

You Don't Get A Rest

Does the writer (who is you if you
send one of these things) pause at
all after mellowing us with soul-sear-
ing prose? No, for two sentences
below we are off to the Commons
Room, "which is ‘common’ only in
the sense of its being a central meet-
ing place.” (Oh, we can breath easily
again after that qualification. I was

cared for a moment.)
Rah, Rah, Pitt_

One more little touch recognition.
One of our “hand-written" portions
shows a little cartoon ofa Pitt foot-
ball player. running with smoke issu-

‘ ing from his shoes. (Try to get the

connection.) The ‘caption to this
artistic achievement says "All the
smoke in Pittsburgh doesn’t come
from chimneys!” (Pardon me; I cannot
continue—I am overcome.)

Perhaps you have no enemy hate-
ful enough to send one ‘to, but I do

recommend themas an excellent cure

for insomnia.

because they get a commission in

the number of paid-up members to
50 by fall.

Plans for the fall semester call
for a scientific poll on student at-
titudes toward world government
similar to one taken by the World
Federalist chapter at Carnegie
Tech. *

The Tech poll found 71 per cent
of the students in favor of the idea.
When worked our “ad infinitum”
the results indicated that for an in-
definite number of Tech students,
chances were 99 out of 100 that the
number of favorable reactions”
would fall between 62 and 78 per
cent.

The group of a half dozen mem-
bers which will carry on the sum-/'
mer work will try to contact more
interested students, particularly
amongthe incoming freshmen.

Achievements of the club during
the spring semester were also re-
viewed. These included final re-
cognition by the Committee on Stu-

dent Organizations after a year on
probation; discussion groups; a
debate on world government by re-
presentatives from Pitt’s debating
teams, prompted by the club; and a
series of talks on world govern-
ment by prominent non-student
federalists from Pittsburgh.

Net Squad
Plays Two

With their knees still a bit
wobbly after the broadside they
received: from Navy on Wednesday,
an 8-0 defeat, Pitt’s netters go
back to the tennis wars against
West Virginia today and Western
Reserve tomorrow at Mellon Park.

The Mountaineers should enable
the Panthers to even their season
record at 2-2, since they have al-
ready outgunned the Mounties, 7-2,
at Morgantown.

Western Reserve on the other
hand poses somewhat of a. problem.
The Redcats always manage to
come up with a strong net team.
Last year they fell to the Pitts.
6-3. And though their ranks were
hit hard by graduation this season,
they are still expected to give the

men of Dr. David O’Loughlin as

tough afternoon. ~

While their big brothers are
meeting the Mountaineers at Mel-
lon Park today, the Panther fresh-
men will -be at West Virginia.

Track Team
.Meets Ohio

The Pitt cindermen will probably
have smooth sailing in,their final
home track meet with the Ohio Uni-
versity Bobcats at the Stadium to-
morrow, but the two mile trio may
run into rough waters.

Pitt's weak spot will be glaring
tomorrow. For Pitt will oppose the
best two miler in Ohio University
track history. He's John Hasketh,
who held a winning streak of ten
meets before finishing third at Bowl-
ing Green two weeks ago.

Last Saturday he started a new
skein by winning the two mile over
West Virginia.

Ken Thomas, Bobcat“ high hurdler,
has placed first in the high timbers
four times this year. His best mark
this year is 15.1 seconds. Outside
of these two events Ohio has only
the mile relay team promising points.

Afterwinningeight straightevents,
the Bobcat mile relay team met its
match in Bowling Green and West
Virginia. The four quarter-inilers are
on the upswing and willbe dangerous.

Starting time for the meet has
been moved up to 12:00 noon.

The News‘ softball ten remained
unbeaten this week, blasting the

Bob Plotz Still Unsigned;
Pro Career Doubtful

By BOB BEWERSDORF

At least one Pitt grid star is scanning the want-ad sections of the
daily newspapers. Bob Plotz, the only one of six members of Mike Milli-
gan’s squad from last year picked in the Nationalfrofessional League

draft last year who hasn’t signed a
contract, has yet to hear from the

Although Clcvcland’scoach, Paul

T formation, the head man will not
actively participate in guiding the
plays. Instead the greying mentor
will hover .between both teams,
checking on the overall play.

Substitute by Teams

Backfield Coach jack Roche and
End Coach Bob Timmons will
coach the first, fourth, and ‘fifth
squads who will battle the second,
third and sixth teams, coached by
Line Coach Herm Meister and Back
Coach John Chickerneo.

Substitutions, Casanova an-
nounced, probably will be by teams
at the quarters. “We’ll have the
first and third teams start it off,”
Casanova said, “and then have the
second and fourth follow in the se-
cond quarter.”

Depending on how the game is
going, the coach will begin the se-
cond half by letting the first and
second teams knock heads.

Injuries Increase

Trainer Howard Waite will have
the final say on the starting line-
ups, as the injury list increased
over the past week. According to
Casanova the cold weather kept the
boys from getting into good shape
and increased the amount of in-
juries.

Fred Botti will quarterback. the
second team, although he is still
hampered with a bad arm. Also
breaking into the second string

than a pack of Scandinavian‘ski-
jumpers. This is not the time for a
bunch of young men to go running
about, bundled up in shoulder pads,
sweatshirts, and assorted other
wrappings - the perspiration cours-
ing down their foreheads as though
they were dashing through Hell it-
self. 1
Nevertheless, these overheated
athletes are determined to stage an
intra-squad head-cracking jamboree
tomorrow, and they will get more
_attention than the baseball, track,
and tennis teams put together. This
is a miscarriage of justice and a
~ violation of the principles laid
down by the First National Bank
calendar; but let's face it, it’s
a fact.
a The situation is largely due to
the fact that Head Football Coach
Len Casanova is going to have his
charges sweating out of a different
formation than Pitt fans are ac-
customed to seeing their teams
melt under.
Accept Challenge
What makes this business all the
more interesting is the unusual at-
titude of the players. Whereas
spring training is ordinarily looked
on as a laborious process which
prevents one from playing baseball,
golf, or just loafing, it apparently
has become a pleasurable pastime
this year.
The challenge of mastering the
new T-formation seems to have
caught the fancy of the athletes,
and they are banging each other
about as though a crisp autumn
wind were whipping at their

There is something lop-sided about these spring months, and
’ it seems the game of football is the culprit. '

backs.

Looking at the situation from a
long-range viewpoint, however, one
wonders whether this energetic at-
titude will prevail in the years to
come.

Probably not.

Spring football practice long ago

proved itself to be essentially
drudgery. Since many football
players are " physical education

majors, moreover, it prevents them
from taking part in spring sports
and getting the education they are
here for. It stands to reason that
the more sports a man has under
his belt, the better qualified he is
for a coaching job. _

The switch to a new coach and a
new system quickens the plodding
pace of spring drills. Assuming
that the rapid turnover of Pitt
coaches does not become a perma-
nent policy, the willingness on’ the
part of athletic collegians to belt
each other about under a sweltering
sun will, however, probably fade
away before many years.

In the meantime, everyone seems
to be having fun, so there ought to
be some action in store for out-of-
season fans at the Stadium tomor-
row.

Pitt Has New

‘Long John’

BY WILL DOERGE

Mo st fans at last Saturday’s Pitt-
Notre Dame track meet were on
their feet, rootin/g and shouting,
as Panther anchorman Johnny
Wilson began the last leg of the
deciding mile relay race, trailing
by five yards.

But those observors in the know
were confident of the outcome.
Johnny Wilson was running, and
that was enough for them.

And the long-legged Wilson
really ran, overtaking the Notre
Dame man on the final turn and
finishing with a great stretch run,
to give Pitt its sweet victory over
the Irish. '

By JOHN MEGELLA

Diamond tilts for Pitt's baseball teams this weekend promise to ‘be
gems of feudin’ and fussin.’ West Virginia is the foe for both the varsity

and freshmen nines.

Coach Ralph Mitterling’s Panthers renew their feud with the Mountie
varsity at Schenley Oval at 3:30 this afternoon and tomorrow afternoon
at 2 ,p.m. Meanwhile Coach Rex Peery’s frosh take to the hills today to

when I started out,” recalls Wil-
son, "but I wasn’t worried. I knew
I had to win.”_

The 6-1 Philadelphian modestly
gives credit to the rest of the mile
relay team -- Len Henry, Johnny
Kountz, and Jim Banner - who
“did as much as I did.”

Although Wilson attracted at-
tention with his brilliant quarter
mile Saturday, his race is really
the half mile. He copped the half
against Notre Dame in 1:56. >

Another ‘Long John’

"Long John” Woodruff holds the
Pitt record of 1:52 in the half mile.

“Some of the fellows are start-
ing to call me ‘Long John,’ ” says
Wilson, "and I feel it is a great
honor.”

With the ‘lC4A_ championships
coming up soon in New York,

Misfit Nine -

BY DAVE GROTJOHAN

A An attempt to play softball
Tuesday evening at, Ellsworth
Center resulted in a 24-7 score as
the, Misfits slipped and bobbled
their opponents, the Faculty Die-
hards, to ‘this five inning victory.
The game was called because
of the 6 p.m. nie.

The Misfits’ play’ was compar-
able to the condition of the field-
sloppy. They went along fine for
one inning and were leading, 2-1.
.Then a roof full of errors fell in.
And a parade of runs came mar-
ching home for two ,innings, the
grand total being 21. When the
"mud from the 21 shoes was brushed
from the plate the game was con-

   
   
  
 
  
 
  
   
 
  
  
  
  
 
  
 
 
   
   
 

by the six o’clock rule.

A It was said that the field was
exceedingly slippery to play on and
'_so the cause for the errors. but

hi Eps Rally in Sixth
To Hand SAE’s First Loss

In a battle of the unbeaten yes-
terday at Trees field, the Phi Eps
rallied in the last of the sixth to de-
feat the SAE nine, 5-2. It was the
fifth consecutive victory for the Phi
Eps and the first loss in five games
for the SAE’s.'

Tied, ‘2-2 going into the last of
the sixth, the Phi Eps tallied three
times to take the lead. Stewart Kline
paced the Ep rally, driving in two
runs with a pinch hit single to left.

Pep pitcher Herb Schultz held the
SAE nine scoreless for the last five
innings to win his third game.

Phi Delts Win

Phi Delta Theta and Theta Chi
played the first base stealing intra-
mural game of the season Monday
afternoon and the Phi Delts not
only stole bases but also stole
enough of the show to win, 4-2.

Due to tight pitching by both

hurlers, a rarity in the intramural
league, scoring was heldrdown to
six runs. George Wallace hurled
for the victors while Paul Harnack
lost for Theta Chi.

Can ’t Seem

To Get Enough Music

By BERT KATZ

Music, music, music!

No matter how you play it,
enough of it. George, known as
cause of his wild musical creat
a lawyer.

This 22 "yr. old Pitt sophomore,
majoring inpre-law, has plenty to do
about music. While not in class he
conducts the George Black Septet,
an aggregation of youngmusicians,
which was the featured band at the
Theatron Harlequinade.

Georges’ musical career started
in January, 1946, when, at age 18,
he went to work as a staff arranger
and musician at radio station WCAE
with Baron Elliot and his orchestra.

Tagged ‘Orson’

It was here he received the nick-
name "Orson Wells.” WCAE put up
with George until March, 1946, when
he decided to hit the road and travel
with a road band, which he did until
December, 1946. .

Pittsburgh beckoned,‘ and George
returned to play in several local
orchestras. Howdy Baum and Tiny
Wolf were Georges’ source of income
until June, 1947, when he decided
to be his own boss.

The first dance his band played
for was the Pitt Alumni Dance of
1947. The band made a big hit.George
was so satisfied that he undertook
the job of arranging music for the
Deuces Wild, Pittsburgh’s own jazz
combo.

Enrolls At Pitt

’”Orson” then enrolled at Pitt in
September, 1948, yearning to take a
crack at the law profession. In the
year and a half that he has been at
Pitt, George has been primarily con-
cerned with his studies. The band
is also keeping; him busy, but with

George Black can't seem to get
"Orson” in the music trade be-
ions, someday may even become

my ‘127}i‘.93a -4- 12...; 7 _

What little time he has left, he has
left, he has written a work of Cham-
bet music for woodwind quintet.

Keeping up the band has been dif-
ficult for George alone, so in order
to alleviate many difficulties, five
of it's seven men are Pitt's own.
Danny Small plays alto sax, Ed
Greene plays bass, George, himself,
on tenor sax, Ray Crummy on piano,
, and Franny Refugiatta on alto sax.

As if all this isn’t enough to keep
himself busy, George is currently a
lone "Wolf” playing at the Anchor-
age Night Club. There, he sings,
his specialty being novelty songs.
Between songs, he also plays in
the band, which is not his own.

And you ask; Does he like music?

THE LIBRARY
ST. LAWRENCE UNIVERSITY

 

By JAMES A.

John Cundieff, a Pitt graduate student now working for his

 

HillAdizisorjllixesSturly,Pructice

 

MCDONALD

Ph.D. in sociology, is” combining his studies at the University
with a real-life education at the Hill City Organization located

‘at Bedford Ave.

Hill city is operated ‘by the youth of the Mil/i.ill district without

regard for race or creed, and it func-
tions as a city within a city.

ltis governed entirely by its youth-
ful citizens, many of whom have at-
tended or are attending Pitt. Mr.
Cundieff’s job, as one of the assis-
tant directors, is to prepare programs,
reports, charts, and supervise the
court.

Not Like Other Cities

"There is only one thing that we
don’t have that other city govern-
ments sometimes have,”Mr. Cundieff
said, “and that i s graft andpolitic s.”

The court system at Hill City oper-
ates the same way as any other city
court, including a presiding judge,
district attorney, and defense attor-
neys, with a jury selected from the
club members.

“However,here at Hill City,” Mr.
Cundieff said, “We place the respC>p.-
sibility of the crime squarely (in the
shoulders of the club members. Hill
City takes the attitude that if its
members had directed the defendant’s
activities toward more useful pur-

guits, the crime would not have hap-
pened.

Doesn’t llandle Severe‘ Cases

"The more severe cases,” Mr.
Cundieff explained, "are turned over
to the juvenile court for handling,
but the petty crime cases are taken
care of in our courts.” A sentence
of hard labor can mean scrubbing the
walls or polishing the floors to an
unfortunate violator of the Hill City
laws. '

Ever since Hill City received its
charter in 1939 as anindependent
municipality, depending on private
donations and gifts for its support,
Pirtsburghers have saved an esti-
mated $25,000 annually by preven-
tion of fires and false alarms.

“It has reduced shoplifting in the

ldown-town stores about 63 per cent,”

Mr. Cundieff said, "and reduced van-
dalism by more than 60 per cent.”

Progress Cited

Hill City has reduced juvenile
court costs in the county courts and
also cut down gang activities in the
Hill district 95 per cent. “We have
saved many children from reform

school and made decent law-abiding

citizens out of them,” Mr. Cundieff
added.

Hill City is the first organization
of its kind to accept both boys and
girls as members. ",Boy’s Brother-
hood Republics _in New York and
Chicago, and Boy’s Town in Nebraska
ignore the feminine side,” Mr.'Cun-
dieff said.

Today Hill City has approximately
2600 citizens’, nine to twenty-one
years old, 2100.. Negroes--half the
Negro population of those ages on
the Hill, and 500 white boys and
girls of a dozen nationalities.
