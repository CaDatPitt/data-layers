With ZBT

Fraternity Merges
With Zeta Beta Tau;
Celebration March 3

Kappa Nu Fraternity affili-
ated with Zeta Beta Tau na-
tional fraternity. The frater-
nity and its local ‘graduate
club voted overwhelmingly
on January 6 to select ZBT
over several other fraternities
which they had considered.

The merger with ZBT resulted
from a decision of the university
chapter of KN to withdraw from
membership in the national after
the national effected a merger
with the Phi Epsilon Pi national.

KN Choses

Carl Katz, public relations man-
ager of KN, stated that since many
of the brothers had chosen KN in-

stead of Phi Ep when they had,

EX-Aviator

pledged; they therefore saw no
reason to join Phi Ep now. He
also said that rivalry between the
two fraternities might have made
any merger impractical. Katz add-
ed, however, that r{N's merger
with ZBT would probably sharpen
the rivalry with Phi Ep, especially
during the rush pe_riods. ~
The Xi Chapter joined four
other chapters of Kappa Nu
which decided against going
with the national in the merger
with Phi Ep.

ZBT, considered to be one of
the strongest Greek organizations
with 22,000 members and 53 chap-
ters in the United States and over-
seas, was founded at Columbia
University in 1898. The fraternity
emphasizes a well balanced scho-
lastic, social and athletic program.

Formal initiationiinto ZBT will
take place at a banquet on April
1.'KN also announced that they
will hold an open house at 229
N..Craig St. on March 3, to cele-
brate the new affiliation.

eliesults Indicate 120 Proposal
Plurality Over Sobota Proposal

By MATT SVVETONIC
The University student body decided in a special referen-
dum election held last Wednesday to reorganize Student
Government under the Representative’s Plan as proposed by
Ray Reeves and Robert Slotkin.

The ﬁnal election results

as released by the Dean of

Men’s Office gave the Representative’s Plan 290 votes against

170 for Richard Sobota’s Presi-O

dent’s Plan, 26 for no change in
the present organization, and 258
for no SG at all.

“This election has shown that
the student body is not nearly as
apathetic as it is accused of be-
ing,” commented Bob Slotkin, co-
sponsor of the chosen plan, “for
the students have picked the plan
which puts the greatest respon-
sibility directly on them.

Sabota Comments

“The cabinets and committees
to be set up under the Represen-
tative’s Plan will enable students
to advance themselves in SG,”
added Slotkin.

Richard Sobota, president of
SG andsponsor of his own plan
of reorganization, called the So-
bota-Reaves proposal “an in-
adequate solution” and feels
“thatin the very near future
the same sort of problems will
arise.” _,

Sobota’s main complaint with
the Representative Plan is the di-
rect student election of senators,
whom he calls “20 potentially in-
capable people.”

‘Not Worth Effort’

“Regardless of whose plan was
chosen, the fact that only 400 stu-
dents voted for a SG seems to in-
dicate that it’s not worth the ef-
fort to have one at all. I would
have been just as satisﬁed if the
Vote were ‘no 1”’ stated Sobota.

In contrast to Sobota‘s view,
N. Ronald Pease, assistant dean
of men, stated that “the new
SG can function properly if the
representatives clearly under-
stand their responsibilities and
are aware and alert to student
Qpinion.

“However,” Pease added, “just

Art Gallery Exhibits
Advertising Posters

By SUSANNE ECKMAN

A collection of posters advertis-
ing art exhibitions that have been
held in America in the last three
years, is now on view in t.he,Gal-
lery of the Henry Clay Frick
Fine Arts Department on the sev-
enth ﬂoor of the Cathedral of

-Learning.

The posters have been designed
by modern American, European,
and Japanese ‘artists, and are
design to the nature of the ex-
hibition that they are advertis-
ing,” according to authorities in
the department. Most of the post-
ers “represent the abstract expres-
sionist school of painting" that is
popular today.

Some utilize unusual typogra-
phy, and some are calligraphic in
character, that is showing the
movement of brush strokes on the
paper. Most of these are black and
white as is appropriate for the
medium.

University Represented

Other posters, for example those
of Jackson Polluck and Alfred

. . appropriate in spirit and,

Jensen, are reproductions of the_
artist’s works. Polluck, who usual-
ly works by pouring paint on a
canvas on the ﬂoor, almost leav-
ing a record of a dance, has done
an-easel painting which is re-
produced. Jensen was one of the
participants in the Art Interna-
tional which was held recently.
The University is represented
by ‘Virgel Cantini, professor of
sculpture and painting. Cantini
‘did. a poster for the Pittsburgh
Liturgical Week, which was an
exhibition of ﬁne arts, ecclesi-
astical arts, and architecture in
the Pittsburgh area.

The Exhibition will continue
until February 24, and is open
Monday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
Tuesday through Friday from ,9
am. to 5 p.m., and Saturday from
9 a.m. to noon.

The next show will be a set of
60 etchings by Lino Bianchi Bar-
reviera, entitled “The Monolithic
Churches of Lalibola.” A show of
students’ work is’ planned for
April.

, Quarterly Magazine, ‘Ethnology,’
Provides Communications Forum
The University’s Anthropology department has begun

publishing a journal under the

direction of Professor George

P. Murdock, Mellon Professor of Anthropology.
Titled “Ethnology,” the new quarterly began under a
University subsidy, but intends to enlist support from the

profession of anthropology. *

In their editorial, the editorslist
the magazines purpose as provid-
ing “an international forum in
which ethmologists of all nations
may meet and communicate with
one another.

Seeks Other Readers
“An additional speciﬁc goal,”
the editorial continues, “is to de-
velop an interested and partici-
pating readership among our col-
leagues in sociology, economics,
political science, psychiatry, and

psychology.” '

Articles will encompass the
subjects of cultural and social
anthropology. A special feature,
to be published cumulatively,
is intended to develop into an
encycloepdic classiﬁcation of
cultural data. The “Ethnograph-
ic Atlas” started in the first is-
sue, which was published in
January.

The editors hope that scholars
recently returned from the ﬁeld
will submit summary reports of
their more important ethnographic
ﬁndings, making them available in
advance of their monographs.

They also hope to publish as yet
unpublished material in the ﬁles
of “our more senior scholars.”

Associate editors are: Fred

The Students '.CI1aice

Nine percent of the student body voted to continue
Student Government. Although this does notconstitute an
overwhelming majority, SG has-been given anotherchance,

thistime under the new Representatives Plan. And while“

no basic issues facing SG have been altered by this outcome,

it; has provenone. _thing: nearly 500 students are behind‘
-some sort of student ‘government. They cannot‘ be ignored.

Working from this basis, then, the representatives must

', realize that their .actual work has only begun. With elec-

tions coming _up, the ultimate success of SG will depend on
the candidates and the issues involved this year.

The two major proponents .of the winning plan will

A graduate in April; their plan will stay on. But only through

strong candidates with strong platforms will that plan live.
SG .must not only reaffirm some students’ faith‘ in it, but
must also begin breaking some of the prejudicial barriers
facing it at the present time. If ever SG needed a dynamic
movement, now is the time.

“Representation” and “legislation” cannot be the key
words in the elections, but such issues as the book exchange,
parking facilities, alcohol on campus, and Pitt Chest. Since
it is determined to investigate such areas, then SG must be
ready with some answers to these problems. Committee

‘appointments will not do. Deﬁnite programs must be out-

lined BEFORE elections by students who KNOW and have
STUDIED the issues. SG must lead. It cannot wait for

 

Neither Need ‘nor Right .1.

 A Hollow Victory

Columbia College has recently voted its under-'.

graduatei governing body out of existence. Students
at Brown University are considering a similar pro-
posal. The University of Akron’s Student Council is
sponsoring a forum discussing
“Student Apathy.”
These, coupled with many
other instances of crumbling stu-
dent governing bodies through- 0
out the country and the recent -‘
student referendum here, seem __
to indicate that SG may” soon 
be going the way of racoon coats
and Stutz Bearcats.
‘ Two hundred and ninety stu-
dents or slightly better than ﬁve
percent of the student body, have ,
decided that we needa more representative system
of government. Proponentsof the winning plan must
indeed feel conﬁdent representing such a sizeable

  
 
  
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

A portion ‘of the electorate. Even the current presi-

dent feels that with ‘such slight student interest SG
is not worth the effort. ,

Judging from attendance at the meeting held
February 2 to discuss the proposed plans for SG
reorganization, Student Government already ‘more
than represents student interest. Acoustics in the
nearly empty ballroom made it difficult for the 31
persons present to hear Sobota,Slotkin and Reaves
explain their plans. Uninterest is obviously the pre-
valent opinioniand uninterest is very well rep-
resented. ,

'Dis6ppoinﬁng" Is Understdiement

To say that the total number of votes in the ref-
erendum is “disappointing” is the understatement
of the millenium. Two hundred and ﬁfty—eight stu-
dents do not ‘want to have a student government;
486 do; 4,257 don’t give a damn if we have one or
not. ‘

A number ‘of-‘factors are .probably responsible
for the apathy towards a campus governing organ-
izatiori but certainly one of the .most important
among them‘ his the cynicism traditionally associated
with any’ form of politics. In state, nationalaand in-
ternational government this attitude is lamentable.

' But in the universitysphere cynicism takes on a
new meaning. As much as people criticize state and I

federal government, few will challenge its existence
—ana‘rchists died with the arch-duke of Serbia.

But with students it- has been diﬂerent. Two
questions are centraldto the resistance: is there a
need for student government? And does student
government have a right to exist?

During the past few years, the need for student
government on this campus has been severely chal-
lenged. Organizations “subordinate” to SG—Men’s
Council, AWS, IFC, Pan-I-Iel, SUB, and the resi-

dence Hall Councils, have very subtly and effec-

A By Jim Hufnagel

tively stolen SG’s main functions. The robbery was
a blameless one-—in most cases they assumed re-
sponsibility in areas where SG*felt incapable or
too busy. The most recent example of this occured.
in December when the now dormant book ex-
change was transferred to Men’s Council. SG’s lack
of self—conﬁdence is justified. In October a com-
mittee was formed to study chances for a new ad-
ministration ruling which would permit consump-
tion of alcoholic beverages on campus or in fra-
ternity houses. A letter was prepared to determine
administration attitudes at other universities. Per-

,haps the committee forgot to stamp the letters for

after four months no results havebeen yet an-
nouned.
SGs Studied . .

The Student’s Role in College Policy-Making 'a
-report prepared by the American Council on Ed-
ucation in 1956, lists 30 areas of interest and action
by 486 student governments. or the 30, Pitt’s Stu-
dent Government has recently acted in onlyione
area, that of “social policies.” The action occurred
last year when they recommended a “clothing
code.” The code has been generally disregarded.
One of the other areas — charity drives -- has

been suggested in council meetings but was dis-. i

missed as “unfeasible.”

Returns from the referendum indicate that “stu-
dents still feelthere is a need for Student Govern-
ment. But how many students? Now. the question
of SG’s right to exist arises. If only nine percent of
the student body favors Student Government is it
actually STUDENT government? _

0 SG reorganized under’ a new constitution just
two years ago. Last year’s candidates ran for of-
ﬁce on essentially, reform platforms. This year SG
has wondered if it needs‘ toexist. ‘Must the 4,500

endure the inanities of elections, referendums and?

reorganizations so thatithe 500 can execisetheixj
well-meaning but necessarily noisy political mus-
cles? A
Meaningless Title ,

To claim the title of “Student Government_Pre-
id-ent” is, theoretically, the greatest honor a student
can aspire to. But if elected by less than a tenth of
the electoratethe title is entirely meaningless and
-——if he honestly wishes to do anything for those
he purportedly represents —— useless, for he can
never really know just whom he actually repre-
sents. ‘ S A -

Because in spite of the referendum, SG’s need
to exist remains questionable and because the ref-
erendum has demonstrated that its right to exist
is even more tenuous, Student Government is, and
will continue, as an organization precarious at best.

Student Government at the University of Pitts-
burgh has won the battle, but what‘ about the war?

_ Bu/t, as in all things, the success of student government
is a two—way ‘proposition. Once such programs have been
introduced, those 500 students who voted for SG must be
willing to demonstrate their faith in ‘that organization.
There is no longer any reason for empty halls during cairn-
paign speeches, whichlany dynamic leader must surely

delivers There is no longer any excuse for poor turnouts at 4

the polls. Five hundred students, at least, must be present.

effective groups on campus.

Librarian
‘Satisfied
With Life’

Dr. Harold Lancour
Recalls Memories
in Book Center Talk

by PETER MILLER

Dr. Horald D. Lancour, dean ol '
the UniVersity’s new Graduate
Library School, told an audience

with his life of librarian "and
book-reviewer, and feels that he
has spent his life in the best way
possible. ’

Dr. Lancour's talk, entitled,
"Random Observations of a Pro-
fessional Book Re\'iewer,” includ-
ed seven observations which he

has made recently.
Lancour has been impressed, he

said, by the great number of new.

or “first novel” writers today.
Many, he noted, have written be-

fore, but their previous works
have not been released to the pub- x

lic.
Humor Labored
Dr.
that much of the recent “humor-

ous” writing creates a “too-labor-l

ed” effect to be very funny. He

feels that many have been worked‘

over 100 well, “like the TV per-

former trying to perfect his tim-

ing.” ,

There has also been an enor-

mous amount of new writing
which concerns Africa. Much of
it is aimed at helping us to un-
derstand Africa and many do
provide an “adequate basis for
our own understanding of the
African people.”

He has seen a good deal of na-
ture writing recently as ‘well as
a good deal of writing about sex.
The treatment of social problems
like segregation has also been a
popular topic.

‘Learn From Writing’

Lancour has become awareof
the growing concern over ‘bring-
ing our scientiﬁc advances into
alignment with our religious con-
victions,” and that much of this
writing i_s done by the scientists

' themselves.

./‘

Dr. Lancour closed by saying
that we can learn much from
reading, and, “We mu t simply
reach out our hands, because the
books are all around us.”

dent Aid.

Lancour has also noticed

team crushed the proud men of Annapolis, 26-3. But Panther
"Coach Rex Peery wasn’t as ebullient as one would expect
after such a— convincing triumph. His youngest son, Edwin,
three time NCAA mat champ white -at Pitt, was the losing
coach, and it gnawed at the elder Peery’s heart.

Like a father who does some
soul-searching after disciplining a
mischievous son .with a switch,
Rex Peery exclaimed, “I hated to
do it. But it‘s just too bad.”

It wasn‘t'a love tap that Rex

dealt his son, either, for he was

always a strict disciplinarian. For
52 minutes of wrestling, Navy
failed to score a pointagainst the
Panthers. The draught didn’t end

The second match of the day
buoyed Pitt’s hopes of whip-
ping well-balanced Leliigh next
Saturday. It took a trip to Navy
surroundings for Sherm ‘Moyer
to “regain the form which he
showed before he wenteto the
Army two years ago," according
to Peery.

Orange Roadblock _

M ermen. Top
B ucknell, Bow

To Syracuse

By LEN BERENFIELD

The Panther swimmers captur-
ed their ﬁfth victory of the sea-
son last Friday, beating Bucknell’s
Bisons, 51-44. On Saturday it was
a different story, however, as the
Orangemen of Syracuse scalped
the Panthers, 68-26.

Syracuse displayed an excep-
tionally well-balanced attack, just
Pitt swimming coach Ben
Grady commented that “Syra-
cuse’s strength lies in the fact that
they are sowell balanced.”

Because of the Orangemen’s all

around ability the Pitt squad was
able toewin only two events. Rob
Levine copped a ﬁrst place in the
200 yard back stroke, while Steve
Ganong took the 440 yard free
style event.

Ganong Sets Mark

In winning the 440, Ganong
broke his own record which he
had set only the week before
against NYU. He lowered the
mark from 4:52.6 to/4:49.23.

Although the Panthers came
out on top last Friday, gthe

Bucknell team proved to be

ﬁerce competitors. Bill Dear-

styne led the Bucknell effort, as
he set a new Middle Atlantic

Cgnference record in th-.1200

yard back stroke. He previously

held the old record.

Pitt's Dennis McHugh tied his
own mark in the 200 yardibreast
stroke event, while the 400 yard
medley relay team of Jerry Sol-
linger, Tony‘ Sarsﬁcld, Rich Rush.
and McHugh set a new record
for the Bucknell pool.

The Panthers will try to im-
prove on their 5-2 record this
weekend when they set out on
the road again to meet Washing-
ton and Lee on Friday, and North
Carolina State the following day.

 

 Cubs Engage Penn
Tonight At McKeesport High Gym

State Extension

Tonight the Panther freshmen basketball team travels to Me-
Keesport wherethey will play the Penn State Extension at the local
high school’ gymnasium. The Cubs are seeking their seventh win

against ﬁve setbacks.

The yearlings latest win was
a 47-45 squeaker over West Vir-
ginia in which Daryl «Ruby and
Bill McIntyre were extremely im-
pressive for the winners.

The Cubs had been beaten
earlier in the year by the same
Mountaineer freshmen outﬁt in
a convincing manner. But this

; time the Mounties were without
the services of star Marty
Lentz for full-time duty.

In the 58-44 win at Morgan-

town, Lentz had scored 11_ poilflts .
in the ﬁrst half before injuring-

an ankle. He is averaging 24
points a game, this season.

B ucknell Falls
In Big Spree
Of Cats, 70-60

By IART FLEISCHNER

A 14 point spree midway
through the second half and
a 58-44 rebounding advantage
carried Pitt to a 70-60 victory
over Bucknell atlLewisburg
Saturday night.

The win made the Panthers 11-
8 on the year with four games
remaining. And althougthfmost of
the talk about a post-season tour-
nament has ceased, the squad
should at least equal last year’:
mark of 12-11, and in all proba-
bility better 12.

As usual, it was Brian General-
ovich and Cal Sheffield who led
the scoring. “The General" took
top honors with 19 while Sheﬂield
had 17. ‘No other Panther hit
double ﬁgures, a feat that has oc-
curred all too often this seaon.

Charity Throws 01!

Paul Krieger, inserted back into
the starting lineup, contributed
nine point.s and a like number of
rebounds. Pitt stumbled a bit in
their strong forte, foul shooting.
They hit on 26 of 34, chieﬂy help-
ed by Genera,lovich’s 11 for 11.

Coach »Bob Timmons, al-
though happy over the victory,
stated that the team would
have to make fewer mistakes
if they hoped to beat the likes
of Westminster, Temple and
Penn State.

One of the players bore him out
in this respect’ commenting, “We

_ should have beaten them by more

than ten points. Their zone de-
tense was pretty. good and gave
us some trouble, but it was most-
ly ou: mistakes that prevented
us from winning by a larger
score.”

Thorn Stars In
Close Victory
Over Panthers

West Virginia made it 12 in a
row~ over Pitt last Wednesday
‘night, defeating them 80-76. The
Panthers were never more than 13
points behind and closed the gap
to two with a few minutes‘ re-
maining, but that’s as close‘ as they
came. -

The Mountaineers, led by
their do-everything ’All-Ameri...
can candidate Rod Thorn who
scored ¥ 24 points, 17 of them
coming‘ in the first half, con-
trolled the boards and outre-
bounded the Cats 63-54. The
leader in this department was
sophomore Paul Lowry who

“He (Thorn)

putting it into the basket.”

Timmons’ main complaint was
that Pitt was getting onlyone
shot at the basket ‘while the
Mounties were taking two or
three. Notwithstanding the fact
that West Virginia had about a
two inch height advantage per
man, the Panthers didn’t “box

Paul Krieger did a good job

turn next year to try and keep it
from being 13 in a row.
