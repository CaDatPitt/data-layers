Continuing The Story
_Of Big Shot Politicoes
And Campus Sell-Outs

By HERBERT RACKOFF

This column today is written
for the benefit of freshmen and
particula.rly green sophomores
who didn’t quite get the drift
of the last one. It’s still about
politics, but of the most element-
ary sort.

A Pi Lam pledge asked me Wed-
nesday what in the world 1 was
talking about. He didn’t‘ quite
understand what I meant by
“sellouts” and being “bought off,”
and what I was trying to do, any-
way?

We’ll start with “sellouts” and
stuff.

First of all, remember that an
election campaign revolves about|
votes, and nothing else. And to!
get votes it is absolutely necessary '
to give something in return. You
could, for example, get Eddie
Horne and all his Pi Lam vote if
you could assure his boys of, say,
next year’s Soph Hop chairman-
ship.

Buying Off . . . -

And maybe Bob Saffron could
swing his whole ASU (now unoffi-
cial, but boy, how they can vote!)
to your side if you absolutely
guaranteed him a permanent meet-
ing place for his young “liberals.”

That’s the principle of “buying
off” and “selling out.” After the
slates are all set, perhaps even
after the SFA elections, but before
the executive committee vote. cer-
tain groups have been, and can be
enticed from the*"fold, “swung” as
Al Barr would say, to throw off
their affiliations and upset the ap-
ple cart.

0 In brief, that’s exactly what
happened last year.~.; After the
Fraternity Coalition 1* (13 men’s
and a number of women’s houses)
had succeeded in winning 16 seats
in the Assembly, it seemed a fore-
gone conclusion that Al Barr, Phi
Kap spearhead, was “in,” as far as
the presidency was concerned. All
that remained was to select the
executive committeemen and go
through the formality of voting.

Here, Barr struck a snag. Bud
Teitelbaum, Phi Ep committeeman,
insisted that since the Tri Delts
had supported the slate so well,
they should be given the woman’s
position open on the committee.

Barr Loses

Barr, in his sagacity, held out'

for a Theta Phi Alpha woman.
Teitelbaum won his point, unfor-
tunately, and the big sister of our
woman’s editor (see masthead,
page 2) got her big chance. When
it came to a vote, however, the
damage had been done.

This little girl (no names men-
tioned) was discovered (through
her subsequent admission) to have
voted for the wrong person. This
can’t be held up as the perfect ex-
ample of a sellout, but it’s close
enough, as far as results are con-
cerned.

Now for that second point, what
I’m trying to do: The results for
the past four years reveal that not
once has a majority group been
able to elect the president. It
seems that he has always been
the minority candidate. Here’s
the record:

1934: Independent victory—
Len Marks, fence—sitter, president.

1935: Victory by 11 fraternities—
Bill Harvey, minority fraternity
group, president.

Tubercull C A
Test Campaign

Nears.l20 0 Top

Health Services Urge
Students To Take
Advantage Of X-Rays

At. the conclusion of the. sec-
ond tliree-day week, students
having taken the Tuberculin
tests numbered 1,171, including
250 women and 921 men.

That many positive reactions
have resulted from the Tuber-
culin tests may be seen in the
fact that already 68 appointments
have been made to take the X-
ray at a special student rate of $2.
Ordinarily, X-rays cost from $10
to $15.

VVOMEN PLEDGE

Tuberculin tests are being of-
fered at no cost to the student, on
Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednes-
days, through a plan put into ef-
fect with the cooperation of The
Pitt News and the Student Health
services.

The campaign was given a fur-
ther boost at women’s fraternity
meetings this week, as all wo-
men’s fraternities passed resolu-
tions pledging 100 per cent mem-
ber support of the Anti-Tubercu-
losis project. These resolutions
follow promises made by all men’s
fraternities, SFA, ODK, and
Scabbard and Blade.

X-RAYS URGED

That close to 1200 students have
already taken the tests seems to
indicate that the 2000 mark
reached in the Wassermann anti-
syphilis campaign conducted last
fall will be passed. The Wasser-
mann tests were taken in a space
of three full five-day weeks. The
Tuberculin tests have been taken
only two weeks and only on the
first thiee days of the week.

-“May we urge all students who

nity victory—

1937: Fraternity victory— .
Ernie Rose, Independent, presi-
dent.

In other words, The News says:
“Let the best team Win, $01‘ 3
change, and let’s all have a 300d
time doing it.” Election procedure
changes, and what they may cause
will be the subject of the next po-
litical harangue.

Incidentally, I made an inad-
vertent slip Wednesday in leaving
out the Pi Lams from the Delt
coalition which licked 11 fraterni-
ties in 1936 by buying off the In-
dependents. Davey Racusin, Jules
Green, and his boys were right in
there when the dirty work was
pulled and the resulting gravy
dished out. A couple of Pi Lams
complained to me about omitting
them. Satisﬁed now, boys?

Current Situation 1

Now for the latest ﬁashes from

the «ﬁeld of battle:

1. Bill Stark and Bernie Mc-
Kenna have taken their Inde-
pendent crew to the Kairy’s
side of the ledger.

. As far as the fraternity boys

. are concerned. Miss Unnamed
and her Tri-Welts seem to be
up the proverbial creek.

. Unless the Greeks get on their
guard, the campus is liable
to break out into an epidemic
of DentAl Kairys.

have not yet taken the Tubercu-

llin tests to take them next week,
.read a joint statement from the

Student Health services, released
yesterday. “We also want to urge
all students who have reacted pos-
itively to the tests to make their
appointments to take the X-ray
photos immediately. Never again
will students get an opportunity
to take chest X-rays at so low a
cost to them.”

Though the X-ray films them-

“Does the Big .Navy7Mean Peace?”

Opposing Kairys and Withum

-Withum was captain and presi-

succeeded in those positions by
Kairys.
They are both members of Scab-

science fraternity, and of ODK. In

addition, Withum belongs to Pitt

Players. He played the lead in
the last Players show, “Ceiling
Zero.” Kairys is advertising man-
ager of the 1938 Owl, and a mem-
ber of the Military Ball com-
mittee.
OPPOSE BIG NAVY

Maclntyre has worked with Pitt
Players. Wible, a transfer student
from Wooster college, writes a
weekly column for The Pitt News.

Kairys and Withum in their dis-
cussion intend to show that the
United States must have a suffi-
cient armed force to gain the re-
spect necessary to stay out of war.
The two contend that prepared-
ness “is the best defense against
war.”

Opposing a big navy, Wible has
stated his belief that “the aim of
the munitions industry is not only-
to cause wars, but to prolong-
them.”

The meeting this afterngon will
last an hour. Part of the time
will be used for questions from
the audience. Milton

“IT'S voun MOVE,” says \ViI-
bur to Mrs. Shaw. His own
move is to light up a Camel-
“ for digestion’s sake.” “Camels
ﬁnish of a meal,” he says.

 

“Camels are
preferred by the
tobacco growers,

who know leaf

tobacco from
the ground up”

according to the
observation of tobacco
planters themselves

Thomas Middle-
ton and his twin
brother James
have been grow-
ing tobacco for 14
years. “The Cam-
el people bought
up my best tobacco last year,” Tom
Middleton says. “They have for 12
years. When anyone talks about
ﬁner, more expensive tobaccos,
that means Camels to me. I smoke
’em—my brother smokes ’em-and
so do most of us around here who
grow and know tobacco.”

 

Henderson Carroll
has been growing
tobacco f orl 8 years.
“For my own smok-
ing,” he says, “I
like Camels. I know
the Camel buyers
purchased just about every top-
grade lot of tobacco at the sales I
went to last year. My own crop
was a dandy. And,as usual,Came1
got the best of it.”

  

“I’ve been plant-
ing tobacco for 20
years,”saysHarry
C. King, a suc-
cessful grower,
who knows tobac-
cofromtheground
up because he grows it. “Camel
bought the choice lots of my last
tobacco crop-—paid more for my
best leaf tobacco. So I know they
use ﬁner, more expensive tobaccos
in Camel cigarettes. That’s one
mighty good reason why my ciga-
rette is Camel.”

something about it . . hockey

had nothing . . except the de-
sire to play by a dozen or more

top sport of the winter calendar

   The Pitt Newsi

 

Tomorrow, at the
\Vest. Virginia Relays in Mor-
gantown, the Pitt track team
will try to prove to some dozen
other track outﬁts that the Pitt.
squad is the best in the tri-state
area. Thus far the Panther
cindermen have been testing
their strength against the great-
est track squads in the country
and neglecting local competition.

Olson will take a large squad to
Morgantown with the intentions
of sweeping every possible event.
The Olsonmen should not have
much difﬁculty outscoring the
other schools entered.

RYDEN UNFIT

Starting out slowly this year’s
Pitt squad has ﬁnally reached top
condition.

the outdoor season, the entire
team is in good shape. When this
meet isjﬁled into. history, the»in-

Mixing sophomores Al Mc_Kee,
Al Ferrara, and Frank‘ Ohl with
striding Johnny Woodruiff resulted
in one of the best mile. relay, teams
in the country. Winners of their
three last racesuagainst the best
quartets in the country these four
boys will be very hard to beat out-
doors, where anchor man Johnny
Woodruff is at his best.
WOODRUFF COUNTED ON
Sophomore Johnny Bayzk is an-
other reason for current unfur-
iowed Olson brow. Johnny has
been placing consistently higher in
the shot put with every succeed-
ing meet. His last time out at the
Butler Relays he missed a first
place by inches.

At the beginning of the indoor
track season track experts looked
to Johnny Woodruif to crack some
of the existing standards. Johnny
spent the ﬁrst two months of the
indoor season t:ying to recover
from the ill effects of last sum-
mer’s trip and a tonsilectomy.
Johnny started to ﬂash some of
his old—time form during the Cen-
tral lntercollegiates and won the
half-milerun with ease in addi-
tion to anchoring the mile relay
team. Woodruff is at his best out-
doors, and with the outdoor season
coming up, maybe _some of those
records will go. A

Captain Dick Mason, Ed Routch,
Ken Ryden, Pete Bennet, Bud

to vindicate Bob Schooley in 
eyes of hockey fa: s who saw him

the three winning goals.

were Dick Friday and Bud Ellis.

typical heckling game much to the
chagrin of Duke center Vance.
Ellis kept good his promise to his
mates to keep the Pitt goal abso-

Duke shots with monotonous reg-
ularity.

Jock Takes Another Sock“  
In The Bread-Basket

FTER one brief month of existence, the
Faculty Coinmittee on Athletic Policy,
now the omnipotent governing board of Uni-
versity athletics, made known its existence by
a decision which lacks all sagacity and con-
tains all the elements that will make for con-
tinuance of the a.nti—Sutherland operations in
the department.

More than.;f_9u.rt.een football pluyoifg have -
been eliminated from the curxielit" spring
drills by the application of a. roommate rul-
 38.  which is additionilly  to
athletes because a similiar I rule whioh E07-.
enis non-athletic activities is not so strenu-
ous. 

-Among théjf fourteen eliminated. fronrthe
drills weije two “senior tackles whose varsity
careers were terminated by. a regulatigon which
was written into the books after they had en-
tered University athletic participat'ioI1. ,

The others, chiefly sophomorcs_a.nd a few
juniors, were forbidden to engage in the pres-
ent practices because they failed to complete
fifteen credits last semester.

While it' is generally agreedthat the result
of this move will decrease a. team that is def-
initely of national championship calibre to one
among the also-running class, this is not the
issue.

\Ve object to the interpretation of “good
scholastic standing” as placed 1113011 The
athletes by the committee, and we object to
one of the regulations in two particular cases.

VVhen it applied the eight.-semester rule to
tackles Musulin and Schmidt, the committee
violated a democratic principle. The decision
was retroactive in that its subjects were al-
ready a part of the athletic set-up when it was
decided to make eight consecutive semesters
the only period of eligibility.

\Vith regard to the new ruling which makes
fifteen successfully-completed credits in the
past semester the scholastic standard for

atli1etcs——this involves an inconsistency as well ,

as being retroactive. I11 order to take part in
other campus activities, only 12 credits are re-
quired. Thus scholarship standards for athletes

From The Diary

of the editor

Review of a few columns in the News of about
a year ago, in which the Independent Party Plat-
form received publication, revives the old debates
on the possibility of Student Faculty Association’s
power to constitute a concrete student legislative
program on campus.

This isinot a gloriﬁcation of the Independents’
programs and ideals——many points from which have
never arrived on the floor of the assembly :':or dis-
cussion, the fate of all political vote-getting plans.

Many of the criticisms of the assembly that
have come from SFA members themselves this
year is that the group is one which has limited
legislative powers that are not augumellted by
sufficient, if any, executive powers to carry these
laws into eﬁect.

Furthermore, there has been considerable
question as to whether the students in the assem-
bly have as much power as their mature col-
leagues from the faculty.

While the student group is numerically strong-
er, by a ratio of three to one, than the faculty
group, some students have continually complained
that the subtle controlused by the faculty mem-
bers more._.than balance the numerical power of the

ecutive Committee this year for a complete dis-
solution of the SFA as a protest against the in-
ability of the group to get its recommendations put
into effect.

A majority of what the group of students con-
sidered major recommendations can be carried
out only by executive order from the adminis-
tratioiit‘-i.-,,. And this year the group found its rec-
ommendations ignored.

This leaves the highly-potential group of rep-
resentative students with little else to do than

Letters

An open letter, to-- ‘

James’ Hagan, -esq. University of Pittsburgh, Di-
rector of Athletics. i

when two such diametrically opposed plans, as
the Code Bowman and the Hagan Plan meet, it is

ble force. In short, one plan must be conditioned
and, revised, or both will be failures; - ’
' The use of the football scholarship, as it ‘has been
explained to me, is an attempt on the part of the
administration to offer to physically gifted students
of -uncertain pecuniary condition a chance to get
themselves. an education—a ‘noble thoght!

Of course to expect them to give their “ﬁne legs .
and broad shoulders” to dear old Alma iMater is
not too much to expect in return, but in my esti-
mation the janitorial duties imposed by the Hagan
Plan transcends the status of anything that ap-
proaches a fair exchange.

In short, the Hagan Plan is all give and no take.
It leaves insufficient time for garnering an. ade-
quate education. Let’s look at the ﬁgures. The
playeer rolls out of bed at 8, dresses, eats break-
fast, glances over his notes and is at the Cathe-
dral in time for a second hour. He is in school un-
til 12:30 after which there eis an hour to go out
for some lunch and go back for his sixth.

After the sixth he must go to the stadium, dress
and be on the ﬁeld by 3:30. Scrimmage last from
two and a half to three hours and the player does
well to have taken a shower, dressed, and started
out to ﬁnd some dinner by 7 p. m. We’ll give him
about an hour to eat and report to the Cathedral
for janitorial duty.

For two hourshe sweeps the floors and clcansup
generally, returning to his rooms at a« little after
ten. In other words, Mr. Hagan, you expect that
physically and mentally fatigued player to get
enough sleep to prepare himself for the same gruel-
ing schedule the next day and still find time for
enough study to qualify as eligible under the Code
Bowman. -

What Hangs Over
' * By Clarence Wible

_ Dr. Arthur 13- Morgan has been dismissed from the TVA ‘
Board of Directors by the dictatorial tactics of a man who was
afraid to face the truth. He has returned to his home in Yel-
ilow Springs, Ohio, to await a Congressional investigation of the
charges which he brought against his fellow connnittec niembers.

That. the President has ordered the investigation does not

President’s own investigation was
one of the most obvious cases of
the railroading of a public official
on record.

One cannot help be confused by
the actions of the President. In
the informal investigation there
was little, if any, attempt made
to hear what Dr. Morgan had to
say.
CONSTANTLY HECKLED
He was constantly heckled by
the President and his aides. It
was little wonder that Dr. Morgan
refused ultimately to make known
his charges i.n View of the man-
ner in which the investigation was
conducted. It seemed only too ob-
viousthat the President was at-
tempting to sidetrack the whole
matter, to confuse the issue by a
display of unnecessary legal pre-
ciousness. A

And now it seems that. the Pres-
:ident is only too eager to have the
whole matter cleared up. Are we
to infer, then, that the only pur-
pose of the White House investi-
gation was to humiliate and to
dispose of Dr. Morgan?

to light. If there are any incon-
sistencies in “the management of
the TVA project, David Lillien-

nor a man Whose face is set
against humanity,” said Nunzio
Mario Morelli. Nunzio, a pre-med
transfer from Juniata college,

not sound like Fascist propaganda
but simply what the Italian boy
really felt.

“He is a father to Italy,” he
continued, “and the Italian people,
perhaps 98 per cent of them are
for him; are proud when they are
called Fascist.”

Nunzio Morelli left the United
States to study in Italy. For 17
years he remained there, traveled
in Egypt, Germany, France, and
Hungary, and fought in Ethiopia
with the Italian army. Is Fasc-
ism for all countries? For the old
countries, yes, but for America,
democracy is probably best. He
believes that a person must study-
the people, live with them, before
deciding just what kind of control
they need. A good man, dictator
though he may be, can make a na-
tion big. , ‘

1922: ITALY CHAOTIC

In 1922 Italy was in chaos and
confusion; today she is an inter-
national power and one of the best
examples of a corporate state. The
anarchy of the after-war forced
Italy to adopt a dictator and Fasc-

. test began one, of their own. A - ~

trial and his co—director, Harcourt
Morgan, are going to be in the
center of a blow-up that will
equal the Teapot Dome scandal
of some years back.

That this is an affair of great
public interest is only too appar-
ent. In the President’s plan for
the government to take over the
electric light and power utilities,
unless this great system sells at a
price which he and his aides dic-
tate, the said .uti1i:t'y-i;=;~system and
their investors wil»l.facé.€otal ruin.
The ultimate end seems to be state
socialism.

ULTIMATE SOCIALISM

And if the ultimate end is to be
state socialism in this ﬁeld, must
we not look towards the TVA
project and determine just how
honestly and efﬁciently this gov-
ernment project is being managed.
The government is planning to

buy up the properties of the
Commonwealth and Southern
‘System.

David Lillienthal will be able to
put over a deal involving $50,000,-
000 to $175,000,000 of public
money without reporting to Con-
gress, or without getting any kind
of legislation passed.

‘ It is no wonder that Dr. Mor-
gan wants to be sure what is go-
ing on. '
