Biden praises
value of college

Stall" l‘l1otog'1‘apliei

Vice Presidentjoe Biden spoke
in Alumni Hall Friday about the
value ofa college education;

Mary Mallampalli

Stqﬁ” Writer .

Whenjoe Bidenjr. started think-
ing about attending the Univer-
sity of Delaware, he knew he
couldn’t bear the ﬁnancial bur-
den alone. So he turned to his
father.

“It was the look on my father’s
face, a proud man, stripped of his
dignity — like so many parents
today, looking at their daughter

or son and knowing that they

can’t help them,” Biden said as
he remembered the economic
hardships he faced while grow-
ing up.

Joe Biden Sr. was dealt a tough
hand. Despite the postwar eco-
nomic boom, he was unable to
find steady work at a well—paying
job, so he became a car sales-
man.

The younger Biden pushed
past the setbacks and went from
being the senator of Delaware to
the vice president of the United
States, and he said he wants a
better situation for young Ameri-

cans today.

He delivered this message to
more than 600 students, faculty
and local politicians crowded
into the Connolly Ballroom in
Alumni Hall on Friday morn-
ing. He spoke about the Obama
administration’s plans to make
college education more acces-
sible and lift some of the finan-
cial burden off students after
graduation. .

The vice president addressed
matters that he believes affect
Pitt students and their families:
the cost of attending college,

A the consequences of living in

America without a college degree
and where to look for ajob upon
graduation.

“I came to talk to you about
jobs, your jobs; the jobs that
won’-t be there when you gradu-
ate,” Biden said.

The visit follows President
Barack Obama’s stop in the city
last month, when he spoke in
the South Side about the impor-
tance of having Congress pass the
Americanjobs Act. Two months
ago, Obama pitched his job cre-
ation proposal. In October,
congressional Republicans shot
down the full $447 billion jobs
package. A few days later, they
killed a piece of the proposal that

. would forestall layoffs of state

and government employees.

A Pittsburgh has been ‘a hot
spot for candidates vying for
the presidency in the last few
months. Massachusetts-«Gov.
Mitt Romney came to the Con-
sol Energy Center two weeks ago
for a fundraiser and, less than a
week after Obama’s visit, Texas
Gov. Rick Perry unveiled his first
major policy speech on energy
_at U.S. Steel’s Irvin Plant in West
Mifﬂin.

Biden mentioned some of the
executive orders that Obama has
recently issued to help students
manage their federal student
loans. These include lowering

monthly loan repayments to 10 .

percent of a borrower’s discre-

Student groups submit  
spring semester budgets

C Michael Ringling
Staﬁ’ Writer

Students who need money ask
their parents. Student organiza-
tions that need money ask the A1-
locations Committee.

Last Thursday and Friday, the
Student Government Board’s Allo-
cations Committee hosted budget
hearings for student organizations
in order to decide the organiza-
tions’ spring semester budget. The
committee met with 17 student
organizations over the span of two
days. The organizations used this

time to present what they would
use the requested money for.

Michael Bane, chair of the A110-
cations Committee, said that many
organizations are intimidated by
the allocations process. To ease
the tension, he said that the com-
mittee likesto use jokes and talk
informally to contrast the formal
discussion of the weekly Tuesday
night SGB meetings.

“When [representatives] are
speaking to a group of 1.3 people,‘it
can be intimidating  I think most
of the reason they are intimidated
is that they are talking infront of
us, not the allocations process,”

Bane said. “We try our best to
make them feel comfortable  We
try to make it more like a dialogue
and less like a presentation.”

The Rainbow Alliance, an or-
ganization that provides for the
interests of the LGBTQ commu-
nity, sent two representatives,
Darren Pifer and Adam Dobson,
to review the groupis budget with
the committee during a 15-min-
ute meeting on Friday.'The duo
stood before the committee as an
overhead projector displayed their
line-by-line budget. .

the opportunity to consolidate their stu-
dent loans.

Biden said that by the end of this year,
college students are expected to accumu-
late more than $1 trillion in student loan
debt, which is more than all the credit
card debt in America. -

He said this is “a huge burden” on stu-

1 dents, and his colleagues in Congress are

asking, “Should we do anything about
it?”

Biden said that this burden is why the
creation of a new tax credit, known as the

American Opportunity Tax Credit — part.

of the American Recovery and Reinvest-
ment Act of 2009 — was one of the first
things he and Obama did upon entering
office.

The tax credit provided aid to 335,000

less than $50,000 a year to attend col-
lege. This grant alone, he said, has allowed
3,000 students to attend the University
of Pittsburgh.

Biden said that before he lowered his
right hand when he was sworn into the vice
presidency in 2009, more than 720,000

jobs had been lost due to the recession.‘

As of today, more than 6.8 million jobs
have been lost.

Biden continued by stating that the
unemployment rate for high school gradu-

ates is 9.4 percent, and -4.2 percent for _-

Americans with bachelor’s degrees. Over
the next decade, 62 percent of all new
jobs will require some sort of secondary
degree. 5 ’ V

two lectures, a conference, the group’s drag
show and -other events and materials for
the spring.

- The two took turns presenting justiﬁca-

V tion for funding of the various line items to

Bane and «the others members of the com-
mittee. After hearing the group’s budget,

' the committee took turns asking questions,

such as what materials could be reused and
what the funding for the drag show would
go toward. A.

The two responded that some of ‘the
money goes toward tipping the dragsters, »
and a few of the female committee members
giggled. .

All groupswill receive the committee’s
decision on their budgets today. From there,
student groups can ﬁle an appeal if they
disagree with the committee’s decision.

Pifer said that for some student groups,
it can be difficult to formulate a budget, but
working with the Allocations Committee
helps ease the process.

“Sometimes people who struggle with
their budgets don’t talk to [the Allocations
Committee], and that’s part of the struggle,”
Pifer said. “[But the committee members]
care what you’ have to say. They listen to
your arguments, they want to hear from
you, and they want to help you.”

Eachystudent organization is assigned a
liaison from the committee who helps the
organization review their requests before
and after their ﬁnal budget is submitted.
Bane said that student organizations should
discuss requests more frequently with their
liaison. " '

“The liaisons arethere as a resource
for allocationsrequests, and I feel they are
underutilized,” Bane said. “If [groups] are
worried about the request or feel intimi-
dated, it’s all the more reason for them to
come up and talk to us.” ' -

Liaisons, who make up the 12-member ' I

Allocations Committee, are required to

attend weekly meetings, budget hearings '

and hold office hours each week. In total,
liaisons commit 20 hours a month to the
committee. V
Allocations Committee applicants must
ﬁll out an application and submit a resume,
and are chosen by a group comprised of the ’
incomingand outgoing SGB presidents, the
incoming and outgoing Allocations Chairs -
and the business manager of the board.

Bane said‘ that the group looks for ap- «

plicants who are involved on campus and
have an understanding of the allocations
process. -

“We look for people who are good at
working with others,” Bane said. “We want
them to be interested in working with the
committee.”

Kathleen Pulice, the business manager.
for Strong Women Strong Girls, said that _
during budget and supplemental request
hearings, some of the committee members.
needed to be more active in the allocations

‘process.’

“It seemed like some of the people at the
table didn’t want to be there,” Pulice said.
“If you are a_ group of people responsible
for what my group needs, you need to be
actively involved.”

Pulice said that because of her experi-
ence with‘ the Allocations Committee, she
has applied for a position as a committee
member to make improvements to the pro-
cess.

Danielle_Bissert, the business manager

for Campus Women’s Organization, said
that improvements can be made to the Al-
locations Manual. "

“The manual has all the basics, but there
are a lot of things that aren’t in the manual,”
Bissert said, referring to the policies and
precedents set by SGB.

Precedents for dispersing allocations are
established on a Board-by-Board basis, so
they are not standardized in the manual.
Bane said he is constantly revising the Al-
locations Manual, and that he -would like to

3

  Students see Worth in Allocations liaisons

see the precedents set by the Board, such as
not funding club sports’ B-teams, included
in the manual.

Tricia Dougherty, the President of the
Rainbow Alliance, said that attending the
weekly SGB meetings helped the group gain

an understanding of the precedents that are

not in the Allocations Manual.

“By the time we get to budget, we know
what will be approved,” Dougherty said.
“For our organization, allocations is some-
thing we do well.” ’f‘i~‘i:

Compulsory voting

counterintuitive

Remember the 2010 midterm
elections? Neither do we. De-
spite activists’ best efforts, only
20.9 percent of 18—to—29-year-
olds cast ballots last year. But no
matter how dismal voter turnout
becomes, we should resist artiﬁ-
cially stimulating it with compul-
sory voting.

Unfortunately, in a Sunday
New York Times op-ed, Brook-
ings Institution fellow William
A. Galston proposed doing just
that. Mandating attendance at
the polls, he argued, will decrease
partisan polarization, hold our
leaders accountable to the entire
country and reinforce a sense of
civic responsibility in Americans.
As evidence, the author cites the
“success” of Australia’s vote—or—
be—ﬁned policy, which catalyzed
a 91 percent turnout in 1925, the
first year it took effect. Austra-
lia’s 2010 federal election yielded
a similarly high turnout —— 93
percent of the population.

What Galston doesn’t address,
of course, are the less quantifi-
able measures of an election’s
success —— namely, how capable
citizens are of making informed
decisions. When voting is option-
al, people cast ballots for can-
didates they genuinely believe
in. When voting is mandatory,
however, many people select
the candidates they admire for
superficial reasons or, in some
cases, whose name comes ‘ﬁrst.

Simply put, we don’t think ev-
eryone should be forced to vote.
Some people are staunchly anti-
political, and others are simply
too apathetic to bother research-
ing candidates’ policies and leg-
islative track records.

In any case, compulsory vot-

ing would be particularly difficult ‘

to implement in the U.S., espe-
cially if voter ID laws continue
to gain traction. Citizens unable
to obtain IDs — most likely, the
poor and the elderly — would be
ﬁned after every election.
Additionally, our voting in-

’, frastructure is hardly equipped

to handle 90 percent voter turn-
outs. Under ‘a compulsory voting
mandate, those who enter a line
at 8 a.m. might not cast their bal-
lots until 4 p.m. A large—scale,’

"time-and-money consuming

renovation of the election pro-
cess would need to precede the
mandate.

Having never witnessed the
results of compulsory voting in
the U.S., we can’t know for sure
whether it would engender the
above consequences. We can,
however, examine Australia’s
political climate, which at the
moment uncannily resembles our
own. Julia Gillard, the country’s
27th prime minister, has endured,
in her own words, an “American-
ization” of the opposition: Her
office is increasingly the target
of Tea Party—esque vitriol. Com-
pulsory voting has not precluded
political polarization.

It’s true that American politics
have become increasingly radi-
cal, and that politicians largely
cater to those who actually show
up on Election Day. But allevi-
ating nationwide political apa-
thy would require a much more
complex series of initiatives than
compulsory voting, including a
streamlining of the votingpro-A
cess, a revitalization of media
standards and the retooling of
certain institutions that _com-

and only then, will voting become l I

a serious civic obligation. I

A MIDWESTER-N PIECE

WW1’s lasting repercussions

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

What connects the current strife
in the Middle East, drama in the
Balkans, worldwide U.S. power
and prestige, the Vietnam War
and this coming Friday?

World War I, which ended on
the 11th hour of the 11th day of
the 11th month of 1918.

Despite having alargeimpact
on world history, Americans
generally pay little attention to
World War I. This makes sense
for a Variety of reasons: First, we
were only engaged in the battle
for about a year and a half and

only saw heavy combat for a little .

more than eight months. Second,
116,000 Americans died during
that time period, compared to the
675,000 Americans who died in
the influenza pandemic of 1918.
Third, WWI was not as obviously
about stopping totalitari'anisr_n,
and the Armenian genocide is
not nearly as well-known as the
Holocaust. Fourth, WW1’s Ameri--
can opposition, a movement that
included socialists like Eugene
Debs, didn’t receive nearly-as
much media attention as Viet-
nam’s. Finally, World War I wasn’t

televised, unlike the Vietnam 

--t,

both Iraq wars.

Nevertheless, the First World a
War helped define the world we ‘
know today. Before WWI, the ‘

world order of the 19th centuifiy,
which was dominated by Eure-
peanpowers that had been 
fully balanced du'ring”the 
Congress, of Vienna, was still veiiy
much in force. WhentEuropea{°ifis‘

' found themselves in conﬂict
one another, a series of compi’g§- '

mises and treaties were us_u—.

A ally established to maintain the
_ peace. For example, the Congress

of Berlin in 1884 neatly divided
Africa into colonies andispheres
of inﬂuence without shedding
European blood (or the consul-
tation of the people who actually
lived there). This isn’t to say there
weren’t major wars in Europe,
but merely that none of them
thoroughlyembroiled the entire

 
   

  R 

    
   

2 Z

continent. There was social strife
and change, but political change
came incrementally.

The years before WWI were
also singularly optimistic. Tech-
nological progress and prosper-
ity had made large—scale conﬂict
unthinkable in the same way they
had made the Titanic unsinkable.
There was a sense that progress
was inevitable and that every-
thing improved with the passage
of time. Even those who disliked
the world order the most.— the
communists —- believed in inevi-
table-progress toward something
desirable. I
. _ World War I destroyed the
19th century and ushered in
the 20th. The Russian, German,
Austro—Hungarian and.O.tto man
empires, all linchpins of theold

order, collapgéed. The French and ,

unscathed. The stage was set for
the United States to become a su-
perpower and forjapan to expand
its hold over the Paciﬁc Rim.
Other features of the 20th cen-
tury — the Cold._War,; WWII, and
even Vietnam —’ were ‘set into
motion because of WWI. "Russia
was probably the worst loser of
the war, which gave Lenin and
the Bolsheviks an opportunity
to establish themselves, albeit
in a civil war that took millions
of lives. Germany only repressed
communist rebellions through

4 the actions of private militias

known as Freikorps, which would
soon provide muscle for the rise
of Hitler (Hitler’s rise as an in-
direct result of WWI is already
well-known). ’ I i

WWI informs more than our
attitudes — much of the current
political stupidity can be traced to
the time of the war. The political
climate of the Balkans directly
caused WW1, and the region is
still troubled. The excitement in

of how the Ottoman Empire fell

Losses stem from
«fourth-quarter woes

R] Sepich
Staﬁ" Writer

After Saturday night’s 26-23 loss
to Cincinnati, the Pitt football
team sits with a mediocre 4-5
record, but things might be dif-
ferent if the Panthers could con-
sistently play well in the fourth
quarter.

In the Panthers’ ﬁve losses, the
offense has scored a combined 10
points in the fourth quarter. Of
those ﬁve losses, Pitt was shut out
three times in the ﬁnal quarter.
<25 The offense has shown that it

is capable of ﬁnishing games. In
contrast to the offensive perfor-
mance in the team’s defeats, the
Panthers’ offense has scored a
combined 38 points in the fourth
quarter of Pitt’s four victories.
Head coach Todd Graham’s
Panthers have held the lead en-
tering the fourth quarter in all
nine games the team has played.
The loss to the Bearcats marked

the third time that Pitt fell in a _

~game it had led by 10 points or
more.

“Going into the second half,
we had them on the ropes,” Pitt
safety Andrew Taglianetti said
after the loss to Cincinnati. “I just

“don’t think we ﬁnished all the way
through. It’s frustrating to_ lose a
game like that.”

If the Panthers had managed to

win the three games they initially
led by double digits — against
Iowa, Utah and now Cincinnati
— they would be sitting at 7-2
and in ﬁrst place in the Big East
standings. l_

Instead, Pitt must now win
two of its ﬁnal three gamesjust
to make a bowl game.

“This is a crazy league and it
isn’t over yet,” Graham said in a
postgame press conference. “We
have three games left. We’ve got
to regroup and our guys will do
that.”

Pitt’s offensive struggles at
the end of games have been the
common denominator behind the
blown leads.

“We’ve been playing sound

football for about 45 minutes and .

falling off,” Pitt quarterback Tino
Sunseri said of the offense after
Saturday’s loss. “We have to make
sure we do it for 60 minutes, keep
our composure and execute our
plays.” ' ‘

While the offense has strug-
gled to put points on the board

_ late in games, the defense has also

had trouble stopping opponents
in the fourth quarter.

The Panthers’, defensive unit
has allowed a total of 56 points in
the ﬁnal quarter of Pitt losses this
season, which means the team has
been outscored by a whopping 56-
10 margin in the ﬁnal _15 minutes
of the losses to Iowa, Notre Dame,

Pitt uses late run to beat Seton Hill

Jasper Wilson
Staﬁ" Writer

A late—game 12-0 run spared a
young Pitt women’s basketball
team from an exhibition loss to
Division“ II Seton Hill at the Pe-
tersen Events Center on Saturday
night. _

With the Panthers trailing 51-

47 with ﬁve mi_nutes to go, a jump '

—shot from redshirt sophomore
Ashlee Anderson started the Pitt
run that eventually led the team
to a 59-51 victory.

And Anderson wasn’t ﬁnished:
She added ﬁve more points before
the ﬁnal buzzer, scoring seven of
the team’s 12 points during the
run. She ﬁnished with 11 points

positives in the exhibition. The
Panthers have six freshmen, three
sophomores and three redshirt

_ In a‘ game that featured 12 lead

she was proud of her team’s re-
silience. ,

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Panthers prepare for last
exhibition contest

Chris Fanelli
Staﬁ'Wri ter

The Pitt men’s basketball team will face one
of the most successful programs in Division
II basketball at 7 p.m. tonight.

The Kentucky Wesleyan Panthers come
to the Petersen Events Center ranked No.

15 in the country by the National Associa- .,
tion of Basketball Coaches and No. 19 by

Basketball Times.

Pitt’s second and last exhibition op-
ponent has won eight Division 11 national
championships, the most recent in 2001,
and should provide a’ tougher challenge for
Pitt than Division III La Roche College.

The Panthers defeated the Redhawks
101-33 in Pitt’s ﬁrst exhibition game this
season. '

Kentucky Wesleyan already gave one
Division I program a scare this season,
falling to South Carolina 69-59 on Nov. 3.
Kentucky Wesleyan’s Panthers went into
the break trailing by just one point, 33-
32. *

The Gamecocks eventually pulled away,

outscoring Kentucky Wesleyan 36-27 in

the second. half.

“I thought the ﬁrst half and going into
the second we were winning, or at least
had a chance of winning this game,” Ken-

tucky Wesleyan head coach Todd Lee said

in a postgame press conference. “They
hung in there and did a good job of coming
back and we just had a bad ﬁve, six-minute

. stretch at the end of the ﬁrst, start of the

second half.”

Kentucky Wesleyan returns three start-
ers this season: senior center Anthony
Young, senior guard Cardell McFarland
and senior forward Marseilles Stewart.

Last season, Young and McFarland were
named to the All-Great Lakes Valley Con-
ference team, and Young is a preseason
‘All-American selection.

Young led the team with 12 points and

   

eight rebounds in its game against South-

Carolina. Last season, he averaged 19.4
points and 8.4 rebounds per game.

McFarland averaged 18 points a game,
while Stewart put up 9.6 points per
game. «

While Kentucky Wesleyan has been his-
torically successful at the Division 11 level,
the visiting Panthers shouldn’t pose too
much of a challenge for Pitt, which will like-
ly continue to spread minutes around.

“We played a lot of guys,” head coach
Jamie Dixon said after the game against
La Roche. “Ashton [Gibbs] only played 20
and Travon [Woodall] 17. We really bal-
anced it out.” _ -

Pitt’s 68-point victory over La Roche
was the Panthers’ largest ever in an exhibi-
tion game. The big men stepped up in the
game against the Redhawks, as freshman
Khem Birch led the teamwith 16 points and
freshman Malcolm Gilbert got the crowd
going with three huge blocks. “I think it
got the momentum moving a little bit,”
Gilbert said of the blocks. “It discouraged
the offense and got the team hyped.”

Pitt’s frontcourt should be able to domi-
nate again: At 6-foot-7, Young is undersized
as a center. A

Pitt’s shortest big man + 6-foot—5 se-
nior Nasir Robinson is sitting out with a
knee injury —- is 6—foot—9. _ _

The exhibition game will serve as an-
other opportunity for Birch to continue his
transition to ‘center, the position where Pitt

. needs him the most this season. After the

win over La Roche, Birch acknowledged the
mental differencebetween playing power
forward and playing center.‘

“I ﬁnd it harder to play the ﬁve,” Birch
said. “It’s more physical. Just the way the
play is, the ﬁve is way harder to play than
the four.”-The match-up with Kentucky
Wesleyan is Pitt’s last exhibition game be-
fore the season opener against Albany on
Nov. 11 at the Petersen Events Center. Tipoff
is set for 7:00 p.m. I '
