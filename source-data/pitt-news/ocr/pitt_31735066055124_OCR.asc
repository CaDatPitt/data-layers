Families ﬂee because of fear, women
worry about rape, and people hide in the
mountains, a speaker said during a discus-
sion about the situation in the Chiapas
region of Mexico. '

Gustavo Castro, coordinator of
Economic Investigation and Political
Action in the Community in Chiapas,
Mexico, activist group, spoke about the

‘ violent acts performed by the Mexican

government on the indigenous people.

“A paramilitary group killed 47 peo-
ple, most of them women and children” in
Acteal, a town in Chiapas, Castro said.

Castro spoke only Spanish during
Thursday’s discussion,‘ sponsored by Pitt’s
Latin American studies program and the
Pittsburgh chapter of the Mexican
Solidarity Network.

Castro told the audience through a
translator, Luz Villasana, that the paramil-
itary group sliced open the stomachs of
indigenous women and cut their breasts.

Castro, who has spent three years liv-
ing and working in Chiapas, said most of
the persecution of the indigenous people
by the govemment occurs in Chiapas,
which has a population of 3.5 million.
More than one-third of the population
there is Mayan Indians.

Chi-apas has one soldier for every 50
citizens, Castro said, and the situation is
getting worse. In one municipal district,
the government sent 2,000 soldiers to a
place where only 10,000 indigenous peo-
ple live.

Michael Drohan, a Pittsburgh resident
who recently returned from Chiapas,
spoke about the turmoil he witnessed dur-
ing his stay. ‘ ,

Pitt unveils new recording
studio in Bellefield Hall

Rebeoca Riddle

Managing Editor

As a pioneer in jazz music education,
Nathan Davis traveled for years to universi-
ties around the United States, urging music
departments to build recording studios to
boost the quality of their curricula.

During the time the director of Pitt’s
jazz music program told other schools they

needed a recording facility, he was ashamed A

that his own university did not have one of
its own. _ i 0 . _ .
After 28 years of planning and waiting,

Davis’ wish came true.‘ Pitt’s studio was built .

this summer with the help of Provost James
Maher, who agreed‘ lastsemester to match
the funds Davis with money ﬁom
theUniversity.    _i , V . g‘

The studio  oﬁcially unveiled
Thursday in a ceremony that included

iMaher, Davis and Chancellor " Mark

Nordenberg.

“IfI decide I’m going to do something,
it’s done,” said Davis. “Look out.”

State Rep. Bill Robinson, a former
member of Pitt’s board of trustees and a big

jazz fan, helped raise the money for the stu-

dio. This is not the ﬁrst time he has helped

the music program.
Robinson has been a key person in

seeking funds for the annual Jazz Seminar, a
festival that brings famous jazz musicians to

Pitt. The new studio is named after trim

because, Davis said, the University would
have had trouble raising the money for the
studio without him. ,

“He’s really made it easy,” said Davis.

The new,_state-of-the art recording stu-
dio teaching facility, located on the ﬁrst ﬂoor
of Belleﬁeld Hall, was unveiled Thursday
and isready foruse next semester.Inthestu-
dio, students will leam how to record their
own music.

This is important because graduate

musicians who know how to use a recording
studio won’t be “atthe mercy of a recording
engineerwhomayormaynotbeonanego
trip,” said Davis. '

With the help of Davis’ son Pierre, Dae
Bemrett, a recording engineer and the son of
singer Tony Bennett, wired the recording

With the banner ”Hell, Healing and Resistance: Veterans Speak,” above it,
workers prepare the Second Memorial Wall, which was displayed on the
William Pitt Union lawn. The wall will be moved to the mall in Washington,
D.C., where. it will be unveiled on Veterans Day. -

eierans and activists
speak against violence  

Megan McDonald
For The Pitt News

One night when Sam Reese Sheppard
was 7 years old, he learned that his pregnant
mother had been bludgeoned to death in the
bedroom next to his.

Police accused his father, Dr. Sam
Sheppard, of the crime. Sam Sheppard spent
10 years in prison before his conviction was
overturned. He was eventually acquitted.

Now, Sam Reese Sheppard is an activist
against the death penalty.

“If my father had been condemned to
death when I was 7 years old, I would have
been facing his execution at age 12,” he said.
“If that had happened, I would have checked
out a long time ago.”

Sheppard joined Daniel Hallock, a for-
mer defense—industry engineer, and several
military veterans Thursday for a discussion
in preparation for Veterans Day, “War, Peace
and Reconciliation: Working Toward a
Nonviolent Worl ” in David Lawrence Hall.

. They spoke out against the death penal-
ty and the honors of war.

The discussion followed the ﬁrst exhi-
bition at Pit of a second Veterans’ Memorial _
Wall, which veterans groups are scheduled
to unveil on the mall in Washington, D.C.,

Ion Veterans Day. Pitt’s Institute for

International Studies in Education sponsored
both events.

Sheppard said the United States’ legal
system is arrogant. It allows some cases to
spin out of control, he said, for politicians
and lawyers to use as opportunities to
advance their careers.

He said the death penalty is one exam-
ple. "

“The death penalty is a hate crime,”
Sheppard said. “My dad just wasn’t hated

enough by the jury, so they convicted him of
second-degree murder [instead of first
degree]-”.

The United States Supreme Court over-
turned the elder Sheppard’s conviction, rul-
ing that he was denied a fair trial because of
prejudicial press coverage and the judge’s
inability to control the cour1room’s “cami-
val” atmosphere. A second jury found him
not guilty, and he died shortly thereafter.

The high-proﬁle case led to the televi-
sion series and movie, “The Fugitive.”

Hallock served in the Marines before
working as an engineer in the defense indus-
try. He wrote a book, “Hell, Healing and
Resistance: Veterans Speak,” in which he
brought together 140 veterans to tell their
stories. He said the purpose of the book is to
show the ongoing suffering of many veter-
ans and their families and to help other vet-
erans cope with their experiences.

“The veterans’ search for wholeness
andhealinghasagreatdealtoteachallofus
about our own healing,” he said. “We need
to create a lot more timeand space for veter-'
ans to share their stories.”

Today, Hallock designs toys and equip-'
ment for disabled youths instead of military
helicopters. A

One World War II veteran said the mil-
itary not only dehumanizes the enemy, but
also dehumanizes its own soldiers. .

“You have a natural human instinct
against killing another person. You can’t do
it, so they desensitize you,” the veteran said.‘

He added that soldiers suffer from a
psychological and emotional wound that is
never erased.

“I came home with the guilt that I knew,
the feeling of suffering and had taken part in
it,” he said. “And it wasn’t something I could
share.”

Students protest death penalty

ehristal Hall

Staff Writer

During President Clinton’s 1992
campaign for the presidency, he
signed the death warrant of a men-
tally retarded black man named
Ricky Ray Rector to show he was
tough on crime, said Pitt graduate
student Deepa Kumar.

“During his last meal, Ricky
saved his dessert because he said, ‘I

want to eat it after the execution;%” 

Kumar said."‘He didn’t even know
what was happening.”
On Friday, members of Pitt’s

Campaign to End the Death Penalty»

held a protest and lectureto abolish
the death penalty. “While Amnesty
International holds vigils after the
death of the inmates,” said Joe
Cleffie, a member of the group, “we
try to be an activist group to-help
get.the inmates off death row so
they won’t die.”

The events were co-sponsored
by the Student Environmental
Action Committee, the
International Socialist Origination,
the Young Socialists and the
Thomas Martin Center. ,

“African-Americans are 12 per-
cent of the U.S. population but are
40 percent of prisoners on death
row,” added Cleffie.'

Only 31 of the over 18,000 exe-
cutions in this country’s history

' involved a white person being pun-

ished for killing a black person,
according to a brochure by the
Campaign to End .the Death Penalty.
Tina Gross, _a__member of the
group, said the ‘eaitipaign wants to
end the death penalty because the
way it is administered is racist.
. “Whether or not_ you get the
,de_a_t_h penalty ,,_gdepends"'more if
you’re poor'an,d‘black rather than it

you’re innocerit. or guilty,” Gross»

said. .
More than 90 percent of defen-
dants charged with capital crimes

are indigent and cannot afford to‘

hire an\ experienced criminal
defense attorney to represent them,
according to the brochure. They are
forced to use inexperienced, under-
paid court-appointed attorneys.

The United States, Saudi Arabia
and Yemen are the only countries
that have the death penalty, said
Kumar.

“It’s a barbaric practice that has

no place in the 20th century,”

Kumar said.

At the lecture, the group talked
about two famous death row
inmates, Tyrone Gilliam and Mumia
Abu-Jamal.

Shuttle and Pitt experiments return to Earth

Two sonic booms announced the
return to Earth Friday of the space shut-
tle Discovery with astronaut John Glenn
and several Pitt experiments aboard.

Discovery landed just past noon at
Kennedy Space Center in Florida to
conclude a nine-day mission during
which the shuttle orbited Earth 134
times for a total distance of 3.6 million
miles.

Glenn, 77, was the first American to
fly in space when he piloted the
Mercury space capsule in 1962. This
mission made him the oldest person
ever to orbit the Earth.

During the mission, Glenn was the

subject of numerous tests of the effects

of space ﬂight on elderly people. He

<3

was the subject of numerous blood and
urine tests, and his blood pressure and
pulse were measured during the landing.

Glenn also assisted Spanish astro-
naut Pedro Duque, who conducted
experiments for Pitt’s department of
biological sciences. Pitt Professor John
Rosenberg is the head of the study.

The experiments sought to crystal-
lize several different proteins in the
weightless conditions of space as‘ a first
step in an effort to visualize their atom-
ic structure. .

The crystals that make up the pro-
teins were separated and illuminated by

-X~rays. A computer will analyze the

images to show the proteins’ structures.
Duque was the mission specialist in

charge of the experiments, and Glenn
served as his backup. V V C

When all of the data from the exper-
iments has been collected, it will be sent
to Rosenberg’s laboratory for analysis.
Rosenberg said the information from the
tests could eventually enhance drug
design. -

Dr. Daniel Carter, president of Ne
Century Pharmaceuticals, who received
his -doctoral degree at Pitt, had the idea
for the project and helped train Glenn
for the mission.

The National Institute of Health
provided the funding for the experi-
ments.

humanitarian organization. Over the
last 20 years, it has helped feed and
aid more than 130 million people in all
50 states and more than 70 countries.
Green Bay Packer Reggie White
works closely with Operation Blessing
and was supposed to participate in
Saturday’s event, but the team was
unable to get to Pittsburgh in time to
participate in the giveaway. White’s
ultimate goal is to sponsor a food give-
away in every city in which he plays.

The Steelers are the third of eight
NFL teams to join White in this goal.’

_“I couldn’t believe the impact,”
said Chris Cox of Sewickley Hills.
“They passed out ﬂiers in our church,
and people just signed up by the
dozen.” *

Phil DeVries, regional director of

' Operation Blessing, said the mood of

the participants was generally opti-
mistic, but he knows the reality of the
situation. ’

“It’s great that people are helping,
but we must realize that this situation
isn’t getting better,” DeVries said.
“It’s getting worse. It’s going to be a
hard winter.”

PROTEST

Cleffie said the reason the
group is bringing attention to the
two men is that they both are polit-
ical people who refused to be
silenced by the government.

Gilliam is a black Maryland
resident convicted of the Carjacking
murder of a young woman and is
scheduled to be executed Nov. l6._

“He had every reason to give up
now, but he is still fighting for the
abolition of the death penalty,” said
Cleffie. ,

Gilliam participates in Live
From Death Row, a forum in which
he is put on a two-way phone and
people ask questions. He already
has informed the ’ organization of
his replacement if he is executed.

“No physical evidence proves
that Tyrone Gilliam pulled the trig-
ger of the shotgun that killed
Christine Doerfler,” said Cleffie.

“The gun was fired at point-blank‘

range, yet no blood, hair, or other
incriminating matter was ever

or alleged murder weapon.”

The Mexican government, he said,
decided that because of international
repercussions, it could not openly shoot

ernment began “low—intensity warfare,”
Castro said.

As part of that warfare, the govern-
ment removed indigenous people from
their homes, “bumed their houses, burned
their coffee harvest, and robbed them of
their animals,” Castro said. They put the
indigenous people in encampments,
“where the people are full of fear and
afraid of the military.”

Februaiy1996, but Zedillo later refused to
recognize the agreement, calling it uncon-
stitutional, Zegarra said.

Zedillo ended the dialogues, Castro
said, because “he didn’t like that the
indigenous people would have their own
educational system, that they would be in
charge of their own natural resources on
their land, and they would be allowed to
‘elect a representative of their own sys-

The state of Chiapas holds 45 percent
of Mexico’s production of hydroelectric
power, 35 percent of its oil, and 40 percent
of its coffee, Castro said. The government
does not want the indigenous people to
control or proﬁt from the resources in their
own land.

» “[The people’s] demands haven’t
been met for decades,” Castro said. “The
indigenous people are always forgotten

Goodbye and good ricidance,
Newt Gingrich

Ding-dong, the putz is gone!

At the end of his term in January,
House Speaker Newt Gingrich will
step down. Bowing to pressure from
both the electorate and the socalled
“revolutionary” element in the
Republican Party, Gingrich made the
decision Friday to not run for re—elec-
tion and to leave Congress altogether.

. While Gingrich’s departure is
wonderful news, Bob Livingston, R-
La., the man who challenged
Gingrich and helped orchestrate the
tide against him within the
Republican Party, is hardly the
world’s most desirable candidate for
the position. Livingston recently
campaigned to block a bill that would
have transplant organs given to
patients on the basis of need. The
way it currently stands, transplant
organs are given to patients in the
same region before patients in other
states who may need them more.

Gingrich is not the only member
of the old guard being challenged ——
forrner football player Steve Largent,
R—Okla., is challenging House

" Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-
- Texas. “What the Republican Party

needs so desperately is not reueads,

not the old has-beens, but the new .

fresh ideas [and] fresh faces,” said
Largent Friday night on CNN’s
“Larry King Live.”

Livingston and Largent, howev-
er, are the last people one could pos-
sibly associate with the term “fresh
idea.” Both are staunch conservatives
— almost every television news
report on Largent features him
addressing the house and pointing to
a chart with the Ten Commandments
-— and are willing to push forward
more controversial, right-wing ideas
than Gingrich could even contem-
plate. -An example was how
Livingston sneaked the organ-distri-_
bution rider into the Health and
Human Services section of the 1999
budget bill.

Despite Gingrich’s outspoken
nature and obvious blunders (his
$300,000 ﬁne for ethics violations,
for example), all the ills of the
Republican Party can not be put on

‘his shoulders. Though his push for

the president’s impeachment was one
of the reasons many voters were
turned off by the Republican Party,
he is not the sole reason behind the
Republicans’ relatively disappointing
election results.

It will be, for the moment, good
to get Gingrich out of the spotlight
But Gingrich’s inﬂuence will still be
felt in Washington; in his time as
House Speaker, he wielded far more
influence than Livingston can ever
hope to wield. A

Random thoughts: sons, lovers and corruption

The enviromnental commitment of oil giant
Chevron —— whose glossy magazine advertise-
ments feature colorful pictures of happy wildlife
— apparently does not preclude the company’s
collusion with Africa’s most detestable military
dictatorship in shooting down protesters who
question Chevron’s vaunted benevolence. 8

Last May, people from the Nigerian village
of Ilajeland occupied one of Chevron’s offshore
drilling facilities, demanding clean drinking
water, employment and environmental repara-
tions, among other things. As Chevron

spokesperson Sola Omole recently admitted on '

Paciﬁca radio, Chevron responded on May 28
by ﬂying in members of the Nigerian navy and
mobile police on company helicopters. The sol-
diers promptly opened ﬁre on the unarmed
crowd, killing two and wounding 30 others.
This is not the ﬁrst time the Nigerian regime
has acted as the literal hangman for transnation-
al oil companies. In 1995, the regime executed
nine activists who had exposed the enviromnen-

tal depredations of the Shell corporation. , ' ~ ’

Incidentally, this is the same
gangster state whose now-deceased
capo Sani Abacha was embraced by
soon-to-be-ex-Sen. Carol Moseley-
Braun, D-lll., whose re-election loss
last week is being mourned as a -
“he-artbreaker” by liberals nationwide.

One wonders how best to congratulate the
Bushes, recently installed as the United States’
newest dynastic family and surpassing in crimi-
nality even the scions of the late Nazi sympa-
thizer Joseph Kennedy. George Jr. and Jeb Bush,
are worthy heirs of their father, the ex-CIA direc-
tor who is one of only two heads of the secret
police worldwide to become heads of state.

Junior, re-elected as the execution-happy
governor of Texas, is noted for his involvement
with Harken Energy Corp., a shady operation
with connections to the conupt Bank of Credit
and Commerce International. In January 1990,
Junior used his name and connections to help
broker a sweetheart deal between Harken and

JOHN

» the oil sultanate of Bahrain. Then, in June of that

year, Junior unloaded $848,560,wor1h of stock in
Harken for a proﬁt of 200 percent, only a week
before the company armounoed that its quarterly
earnings had dropped $23.2 million, leading to a
six-month, 60-percent decline in the company’s

stock value. In violation of Securities and L

Exchange Commission rules, Junior didn’t ﬁle
his “inside” stock sale until March 1991.
Jeb, now governor—elect of Florida, has also
-had connections with BCCI. Additionally, he is a
favorite of the anti-Castro zealots in Miami, hav-
ing successfully prevailed upon Daddy to parole
Orlando Bosch, a deranged psychopath whose
acts of “freedom-ﬁghting” have included killing
76 people in the bombing of a Cuban civilian air-
liner. During the 19803, Jeb continued Daddy’s
tradition of covert operations by assisting the
crooked operatives of the Nicaraguan Contras.
He was connected with Miguel Recarey Jr., head
of the HMO International Medical Centers,
which illegally provided medical treatment to
wounded Nicaraguan terrorists in its Miami hos-
pitals. Jeb lobbied the Department of Health and
Human Services so IMC could be exempt from
regulations prohibiting a company from getting
more than 50 percent of its income from
Medicare; later, it was discovered that IMC had
been embezzling Medicare funds. Also, there is
the infamous picture of Jeb shaking hands with
I ’ Leonel Martinez, a Maﬁa-connected
Contra supplier arrested in 1989 for
transporting roughly 3000 kilograms

1986. So go the wars against crime,
drugs and terrorism. ‘
Meanwhile, .the society envisioned by
Reagan’s and Bush's anointed “freedom ﬁght-
ers” is now fully operational in Nicaragua. In
order to break the inﬂuence of non-govemmen-
tal organizations, Nicaraguan President Arnoldo
Aleman has stalled in declaring a state of emer-
gency in the wake of Hurricane Mitch, refused to
recognize the tax-exempt status of any humani-
tarian aid that does not go through the govem-
ment ﬁrst, and even prevented a volunteer
brigade of Cuban doctors from entering the

Truth and Reconciliation Commission: healing from apartheid

Michael .|. Mazza

Columnist

Under the dehumanizing system
known as apartheid, citizens of the
Republic of South Africa were classified
according to their race. Black and
mixed—race individuals were systemati-
cally deprived of basic human rights;
opponents of this system were subject to
political persecution and physical vio-
lence.

Apartheid ended in the early 1990s,

‘ but the pain of apartheid still torrnents

this nation. One group of individuals
who have tried to aid the healing process
is the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, chaired by Archbishop
Desmond Tutu. For several years, the
commission has taken testimony from
individuals and groups who were instru-
mental in both the maintenance and dis-
mantling of apartheid. Tutu presented
the commission’s report to South African
President Nelson Mandela on Oct. 29;

. this historic event was front-page news

throughout the world.

The work of the commission has
been of particular interest to Christians
of all races in all nations. This interest
stems from the tragic fact that apartheid
was defended by the Dutch Reformed
Church of South Africa for generations.
While progressive Christian activists
like Tutu were struggling to end. this
oppressive system, their own Christian

brothers and sisters were worshipping
the false gods of racism.

Johann Kinghom has written
insightfully on the role played by
Christians in the support of apartheid in
his article “The Theology of Separate
Equality,” which has been anthologized
by editor Martin Prozesky in the 1990
collection “Christianity Amidst
Apartheid.” Kinghom notes that a tum-
ing point in the controversy over
apartheid came in 1948; in that year, the
Transvaal Synod of the Dutch Reformed
Church formally accepted a report enti-
tled “Racial and national apartheid in the
Bible.” Written by a prominent New
Testament .scholar, this report declared
that apartheid “was indeed in accordance
with the Scriptures.”

Like those American Christians who
have strip—mined the Bible for useful
texts with which to defend segregation,
disenfranchisement of women and anti-
gay legislation,. so too did South Africa’s
Dutch Reformed Church’ abuse the
Judeo-Christian Scriptures. They cited
such passages as Deuteronomy 32:8 and
Acts 17:26 in order to prove that the
racial, ethnic and geographical divisions
of mankind were God-ordained and not
to be transgressed. They pointed to the
story of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11)
as “proof” that the desire to unify
humankind was an affront to God.

_ Despite the fall of apartheid and the
work of the commission, the hard-line

racists of the Dutch Reformed Church
refuse to give up their fears -and hatreds.
In a Dec. 17, 1997, article for Christian
Century magazine, John W. de Gruchy
noted that whereas those churches that
were the most committed to the anti-
apartheid struggle “were the first to

‘ admit their faults and failures” before the

commission, “the Dutch Reformed
Church’s confession was somewhat
bland and general.”

Indeed, many in the Dutch
Reformed Church, despite the end of
political apartheid, wish to continue
practicing racial segregation in their
Churches. As the New Pittsburgh Courier
reported on.Oct. 17, this issue remains a
topic of “heated debate” among -the
white Christians of this denomination.

While deploring the refusal of the
Dutch Reformed Church of South Africa
to decisively turn away from racism, we
should not downplay the guilt that many
American Christians bear for their
actions — or inaction — during the
struggle against apartheid. Many
American Christians willfully ignored
the cries of their black and white
brethren who pleaded for help in the
anti—apartheid struggle.

Other American Christians overtly
supported the apartheid regime, as Jim
Wallis observes in his 1997 manifesto
“Who speaks for God.” Wallis notes that
white Christian televangelist Jerry

Falwell called Tutu “a phony” in the late

.t t.LE1"rERs

1980s. Wallis also‘ notes that white
Christian televangelist Pat Robertson,
after a visit to South Africa in 1993, cal-
lously declared that the blacks of South
Africa “don’t have it all that bad.”

It is not surprising that men like
Falwell and Robertson, in their incessant
war against lesbians and gay men, utilize
language similar to that used by the
racist Christians of South Africa. The

‘work of South Africa’s Truth and

Reconciliation Commission should be a
wake-up call to those ‘Christians — in
the United States and elsewhere — who
remain addicted to systems of marginal-
ization and domination. Those who rape
the Bible in an ugly attempt to justify
these destructive systems need to learn
from the tragic mistakes of the Dutch
Reformed Church.

The healing process in South Africa
will continue as people of all races and
all faith traditions unite to confront the

. injustices of the past. But the legacy of

apartheid is not just a South African
issue. The struggle against oppression
and bigotry is a universal enterprise. All

of us who hunger for justice need to-

stand_ in solidarity with our South
African brothers and sisters; in doing so,
we can learn from their painful pilgrim-
age.

It was the return of the Mack that got
to the Pitt Panthers Saturday. Actually, it
was the Mac and Mack show that

doomed Pitt’s ever-so-slight bowl
chances. Backup quarterback Mac

' DeVito came into the game for Temple’s

second possession of the third quarter and
led the Owls’ comeback in the 34-33
defeat of the Panthers.

As Panther defensive end Julian

_ Graham put it, DeVito “came inllwith a

spark.” But DeVito wasn’t the onlyone
who hurt the Panthers on Saturday.
Tailback Stacey Mack rushed 12 times
for 78 yards, gaining a whopping 6.5
yards per carry. These two Owls con-
tributed to whatPanther defensive back
Seth Homack ‘said was the “worst loss

I’ve ever .experienced.’’ I, guess I_can-

agree with that, although it’s tough to beat
that home loss to Rutgers a few weeks
ago.
The Panthers have now lost their last
three games to quarterbacks - Mike
McMahon of Rutgers, Donovan McNabb
of Syracuse, and Mia‘c£DeVito of,7Temple.
Isn’t * that something?  .:Can-  you say
McJinx? Oh, I almost forgot’ to mention
Syracuse running back Kyle McIntosh.
Forget about the loss for a few min-
utes. Let’s look at the positives that come
out of this loss to Temple. O K ,
maybe that was the wrong_thing to write.
There are no positives that come out of a

loss to Temple. As coach Walt Harris put —

it, “We didn’t take advantage of enough
of our opportunities.  We just didn’t get
it done.”

It was a game of firsts. Brandon
VVilliams scored the first two touchdowns
of his career. He ran for his ﬁrst 100-yard
game as a Panther. The game was the first
time Temple defeated a conference oppo-
nent in two consecutive seasons since the
start of the Big East football conference in
1992. Unfortunately for Pitt, this wasn’t

the first time it had blown a big lead to a .

team in the lower echelon of the Big East.

Pitt plays to thelevel of its competi-
tion. It should be interesting to see what
happens next week when the Panthers
host Boston College. The Eagles are just
as unpredictable. They have the same
problems that the Panthers have. They
beat top-25 Georgia Tech, but then they
fell to Navy, On Saturday, they played
Notre Dame close but then fell, 31-26. It’s

‘anybody’s guess as to what will happen
when the Panthers and the Eagles play“

Owls pull offa shocker at Pilt, 34-33?

Kevin Lilley
Senior Football Writer

The Pitt Panthers held a comfortable
23-7 lead over Temple until the Owls
unleashed their secret weapon.

Early in the third quarter, the Owls
replaced starting quarterback Devin Scott
with Mac DeVito — a 5- ~ -
foot—l1, 180-pound fresh-
man who had completed
one pass in two attempts
going into Saturday’s ‘con-
test at Pitt Stadium.

-DeVito finished the

game with ﬁve comple-
tions, 127 passing yards,
two touchdowns and one
come—from—behind victory
over the Panthers, eliminat-
ing Pitt from bowl con-
tention and doorning coach
Walt ‘Harris to his first sub-
.500 season in Pittsburgh.
_ /“Obviously, I think the
guy that made the differ-
ence was the quarterback,”
Hairis said, describing
DeV1to’s play. “He made it
go.”

The freshman made
Temple’s offense go on his
very first try, taking the
team on a 73-yard touch-
down drive to cut Pitt’s
lead to nine points. He ﬁn-
ished the march with a 26-
yard scoring" strike to Carlos Johnson,
who sped past D.J. Dinkins.into the end
zone so fast the Pitt, defensive back did
not have time to turn around before the
ball arrived. ’

On their next possession, the
Panthers drove 66 yards for a ﬁeld goal to
widen the margin to 12. The Pitt defense,

which came into the game ranked 17th in

the nation before giving up 412 yards to

the 2-7 Owls, ﬁnally clamped down on

DeVito, forcing a fourth-and-1 on Pitt’s

38-yard line. 8 , ,

But the freshman ducked under Nick
Cole’s tackle on a fourth-down quarter-
back sneak, putting the ball on the Pitt 37. ’

 

Brandon Williams had one man left to beat all day but could not
break the big run despite his first I00-yard performance as a Panther.

On his next snap, DeVito scrambled out
of the pocket, looping toward the line of
scrimmage; as he reached it, he stopped
dead, planted both his feet, and‘ tossed
another touchdown to Johnson to make
the score 26-21 Panthers.

To the jeering crowd of 39,827,
DeVito appeared over the line of scrim-

mage when he threw the pass. Harris
refused to comment on the officials’ call,
but Pitt defensive end Julian Graham said,
‘‘I don’t know what’s on [the referees’]
minds sometimesi” * '

.‘The two teams traded punts before
Pi§t_ -could answer the Temple rally —

LyI”t'le ﬁred a 17-yard touchdown pass to

~ ,R.J. English to cap a 36-
yard scoring drive and
extend the Pitt lead to 12
points. He did it without
the helpvof running back
Brandon lVVilliams, who
ran fora career-high 108
yards in the contest but
managed only 5 of those

ter. .
“I really don’t feel any
joy,” said Williams, when

Panther touchdowns.
“We still got the ‘L’ in the
loss column.”

After English’s catch
(his first touchdown of
his collegiate career), the
game still seemed to be a
..W_.,

But DeVito would strike
again, this time leading
Temple on a 62-yard
scoring drive that ended
with Stacey Mack’s 2-
yard touchdown plunge
off left tackle. Pitt could only musterone
ﬁrst down on its next drive, and faced
with fourth-and-13 on the Owl 29, Chris
Ferencik lined up for a 46-yard ﬁeld goal.

Men's and women’s swimming finish 1-2

Patrick Robertson
Sports Editor

The men’s and women’s swim-
ming and diving teams headed in
opposite directions this weekend
but came back with identical
results.

The women finished the week-
end 1-2 at Notre Dame, and the men
finished with the same record at the
University of North Carolina.

The women beat Miami while
falling to Notre Dame and Purdue.

“Wecould have had a much bet-

ter meet with Purdue,” said
women’s head coach Marian
Cassidy Keen. .

She said this because in the firs
race, Pitt’s relay team was disquali-
fied. If the team had finished well,
the Panthers would have had a
much better chance of beating
Purdue in the race. .

She was not disappointed with
her team’s performance against
Notre Dame, though, calling the

-Irish “a pretty big favorite to win

our conference [the Big East].”
Senior Samantha Chabotar,

junior Beth Grube and junior Liz
Perry swam well for the Lady
Panthers, with Chabotar taking firs
in the 1650-yard freestyle. 

Chabotar and Grube are just a
little behind their final paces of last
year, while ‘Perry is a bit ahead of
her Big East meet-pace, according
to Cassidy Keen.

Grube’s highest finish was sec-
ond in the 100 backstroke, and

Staff Writer

To Pitt football fans, Saturday’s 34-
33 loss to Temple was an atrocity, but
there "were a few bright spots for the
Panthers, speciﬁcally some signiﬁcant
firsts.

With 3:15 left in the ﬁrst quarter
and Pitt already holding onto a 7-0 lead,
freshman running back Brandon
Williams took a handoff from Matt
Lytle and powered up the gut into the
end ‘zone for a touchdown - his first as
a Panther.

Williams, a top running-back
recruit when he left nearby Valley High
School last year, hasstarted every game
this year in the backfield but had yet to
dance the ball into the end zone in the
197 yards he’d amassed ‘before
Saturday.

Williams earned his second career
touchdown in the second quarter on his
way to becoming the ﬁrst Panther to
run for 100 yards in a game this season.
Sophomore wide receiver R.J. English
didn’t let Williams hog the firsts spot-
light, however.

English, who hadn’t caught a pass
before Saturday’s contest, hauled in a
pass at the 2-yard line with 7:31 left in
the fourth quarter, fell into the end zone
with his momentum, and was pinned to
his back by a defender to earn his first

 
 

 at Pittvf; 
 was a walk-on last season,

ple game  

 touchdown against the
Owls was actually the second he scored
while wearing a Pitt uniform. He caught

1 an 11-yard pass in the Blue—Gold scrim-

mage for a score. English caught one
other pass _in Saturday’s contest for a
total of 24 yards on the day. ’

Williams’ second career touchdown
came with 6:20 left in the second quar-
ter and Pitt up 13-0. After a run of 6
yards up the middle from the 7-yard
line, Williams was stopped by Temple’s
defense onhis next run, bringing up a
third-and-inches situationp

Taking the‘ handoff to his left,
Williams busted through Temple’s
defensiveline for a touchdown and a
20-0 Pitt lead after Chris Ferencik’s
completed extra-point kick.

In the third quarter, Williams took a
handoff at Pitt’s 48-yard line and
crossed the midﬁeld stripe to Temple’s
49 on the last play of the quarter.
Although it wasn’t an especially note-
worthy play by itself,"those 3 yards put
Williams over the 100-yard mark for
the game - a feat no other Panther has
done this season.

Williams finished the game with
106 rushing yards on 27 carries, an
average of 3.9 yards per carry. To date,
Williams has 303 yards on 86 carries in
eight games for 3.5 yards per carry.

next Saturday. Just remember one thing:
The star playerof Boston College is run-
ning back Mike Cloud. What are his ini-
tials? M.C.

Temple played the ﬁrst half like it
was another Philadelphia team, the NFL’s
Eagles, but then it turned up its intensity
when DeV1to came into the game.

There was one thing that greatly

2 affected the outcome ofpthe game, and

that was the men in stripes. That’s right,
the refs made some questionable calls.
Big shocker there, huh?

The play that was the talk of the
postgame conference was DeV1to’s 37-
yard touchdown pass to Carlos Johnson at
the beginning of the fourth quarter. It
appeared that DeV1to crossed the line of
scrimmage before -he let the pass go.
Harris refused to comment on it after the

game, but  spoke up.

“Everyone on the sideline saw the

play,’’ said Graham. “Maybe some of the
refs don’t want to see Pitt win.”

Well, maybe the refs don’t want to
see Pitt win, but even the refs couldn’t

take the game away from Pitt the way that _

the Panthers were playing in the first half.
After Pitt jumped to a 20-0 lead with six
minutes to go in the half, Temple was
expected to just go away, but that didn’t
happen. Mack’s 2-yard run with two min-
utes left in the half kept the Owls within
striking distance, and in the second half,
they struck That’s been the story of Pitt’s
season so far, but the Panthers must ﬁnd a
way to reverse that trend and start to get
some wins.

Mario Machi is a columnist for The Pitt
News, and he is thinking of changing his
name to McMachi and then trying to help
the Pitt team.

beyond 38 yards all last season. This
offering was a line drive right at Temple
defender Amores Intoe, who smacked it
back at Ferencik.

The kicker recovered the ball on the

. Pitt 49-yard line. Eight plays later, DeV1to

sneaked into the Panther end zone from 1
yard out to give Temple its ﬁrst lead of the
contest.

The run gave the freshman signal-
caller 21 yards on the ground, ranking
him third on his team behind Mack and
Elmarko Jackson.

“DeVito came in with a spark,”
Graham said. “He seemed pretty fast,
pretty shifty. He seemed like a pretty ath-

' letic guy.”

Lytle, who outweighs DeVito by

nearly 50 pounds and is 6 inches taller

than the Temple quarterback, attempted to
answer in the game's closing seconds.

Starting’ from his own 30-yard line,
he ﬁred four incomplete passes, including
one that was nearly intercepted by Kevin
Harvey — the starting Temple defensive
back who had been ahead of DeV1to on
the quarterback depth chart until last
week

Vifith four seconds remaining, Lytle
ﬁred his last incompletion of the day — a
hail Mary that landed untouched by his
Panther receivers. The offense left the
field to a resounding round of boos from
the few remaining fans.

“I feel sick,” Lytle said after his 19-
for-34, 223-yard passing performance.
“It’s the same old story. We’re up how
many points, and we give them the ball-
game in the end. I '

“I feel sick. I’m pissed off. What

more can I say?”
