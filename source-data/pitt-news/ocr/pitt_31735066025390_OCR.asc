University agrees to open
lead researcher hearings

By Christine Hanna
News Assistant

Open hearings for Pitt professor Herbert
Needleman will be held April 13 and 14 in
ZK56 Forbes Quad.

The hearings on April 15 will begin at 10
a.m. and continue until, 5 or 6 pm, Pitt’s
Research Integrity Officer Jerome
Rosenberg said. The meeting on April 14
may begin a little earlier in the morning,
but nothing has been decided, he said.

The hearings will determine whether or
not Needleman, a professor of pediatrics
and psychiatry, misrepresented his research
of the dangers of lead poisoning.

Needleman’s landmark 1979 research
showed that low levels of lead exposure
had an effect on children’s intelligence.
Needleman contends that these attacks
are part of the effort by the-lead industry

Beginning in the fall, Professor Ted
Windt will be implementing a vanguard
series of tapes showing Presidential
Rhetoric in it’s truest form.

Claire Ernhart of Case Western Reserve
University and Sandra Scarr of the
University of Virginia have accused
Needleman of “massaging” his data to
show an association between .lead and
IQs.

Ernhart has received funding from the
lead industry, while Scarr has appeared as
a paid witness in several of the lead
industry’s court cases.

The Office of Scientific Integrity of the
National Institutes of Health looked into
‘the charges made by Ernhart and Scarr,
and then requested an in—house
investigation five weeks ago.

The Research Integrity Policy states that
all hearings are to be closed, but

Schools should be a place children

the Tenth Biennial Paul H. Masoner
Education Lecture in the William Pitt
Union yesterday.

“I think when children are so scared
that they carry guns to school, we are
in the middle of a law and order issue
as well as an educational one,” he
said.

Australia and on redefining the
educational process.

He outlined several plans for
improving low-income education
which center on a redefinition of the
poverty level based on resource ,
availability rather than focusing on
minorities. _ ‘

“The idea of poverty was that of a
cycle  the transmission of poverty to
thenext generation. In addition, the
poor have "traditionally been regarded
as culturally different. That has been
discredited."

Connell feels that although this
perception of the poor has been
proven false by anthropologists and
sociologists, its influence on outdated
educational philosophies still has to
be overcome.

IFC revises social policy A

By Heather Gahres
.S'ta_[f Writer

A newlsocial policy was
accepted, and a fraternity was
rejected by the Inter-
Fraternity Council on
Tuesday night.

The IFC changed its social
policy. The new policy says
that all parties and social
functions must end at 2 a.m.

Under the new policy, the
fraternities are expected to
turn off all music and stop
serving all alcohol at 2 a.m.

‘ Also, the individual chapters

assume all liability and
responsibility for guests
remaining in the fraternity
after 2 a.m., ‘according to
Derrick St. Clair, IFC social
co—chair.- ’

“It was the recom-
mendation of Pitt officials,
like Dr. Harmon [vice

V chancellor of student affairs]

that parties end at 2 a.m. by
the enforcement of
fraternities themselves. [The
new policy] will not only be
in the best interest of the IFC
and the university

administration, but it will also
help to contribute to the safety
and well—being.of guests, both
male and female, at fraternity
parties,” "Dave Matta, IFC
internal vice president, said.

In other business, Kappa
Delta» Rho petitioned to
become a member of the
IFC.

Kappa Delta Rho member .

Mike Bennett said that the
members of the fraternity
were enthusiastic. “We want
to become active members
of the Greek system at Pitt,”
Bennett said. V

Bennett also said that
Kappa Delta Rho had a lot to
offer the IFC. He said its
philanthropic work has set

records for collecting money ‘

for the past two years. He
also said that ithad two
members in the mentor
program who could push
Greek life. ,
However the IFC voted
against admitting Kappa

Delta Rho into the council.

One reason against the
fraternity was the fear of a
precedent being set. “This

IFC is not ready for
expansion. We would be

_ setting aprecedent that any

national fraternity could set
up a chapter at Pitt and then
automatically become
recognized by the IFC,”
Christopher Block, IFC
external vice president, said.

Another main objection to
allowing the fraternity to

become a member ofthe IFC _

was the lack of housing for
fraternities. .

“Until room becomes
available for the existing
fraternities, we can’t expand,”
Matta said.

Eddie Iff t of Delta Tau Delta
said about the IFC expansion,
“There are two sides to every
coin. If we let [Kappa Delta
Rhol in the IFC, what’s to
stop any other national
fraternity from starting a
chapter lat Pitt] without being
recognized by the IFC? But

there’s also the point that‘

community as a fraternity of

the professor a mere three times a term,
which provides little time to adequately
discuss the wide range of topics offered in
Presidential Rhetoric. Windt came up with
the concept of videotapes to “capture the
essence of what I‘do.”

The videotapes will integrate class
lectures with actual footage of presidential
speeches. The course concentrates
primarily on the presidencies of Kennedy
and Johnson, and the half-hour tapes will
include an overview of their terms, analysis
of their speeches, types of ‘arguments and

summaries of crises such as the Bay of Pigs

I

and Vietnam.

“I want the students to get a feel for what
I do,” Windt said. “I give so much more
than just book information. Rhetoric
happens on television. There is much
more emphasis when you can see it.”

In addition to the videotapes for students,
the series will be played across the state
on Panarama television on the Information
Cable Network in September. As executive
producer of the tapes, Windt is “very
pleased with the quality of the work.”

all students to have access to by August. '

He also plans to integrate the tapes into
both his Presidential Rhetoric I and II
courses to provide further reinforcement
and emphasis on presidential
speeches. . .

“We’re starting to experiment,” Windt
said.”We’re in the vanguard.” ‘

Society Sets goalsforfall

By George Kopec
Sta_ﬂ'Writer _ ,

The Blue and Gold Society will
work to improve alumni relations
and decrease student apathy this
fall.

Wednesday afternoon, Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O'Connor
presented the first group of 19
students who will serve as society
members.

“This program can really have
a dramatic effect on this campus,”
he said.

Lee Patouillet, executive
director of the Alumni Association,
agreed. “It is a very important

- program for us,” he said.

The program has set a number
of goals as it prepares its activities
for the fall including trying to
keep the alumni in better contact
with what happens on campus.

/“I hope to improve alumni
relations and to integrate the
alumni with the undergraduates,”
said Michele Morgan, a member
of the society. '

Other goals for the group
include becoming an informed

body of students and educating
various campus visitors.

Provost Donald Henderson said
he expects the group “to be
ambassadors for the institution,
to represent us to our various
publics, and this looks like it will
be a great group.”

Vice-Chancellor of Student
Affairs, William Harmon, saw a
similar group at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham.

“The students there had great
knowledge of the institution," he
said.

The society also hopes to
reduce the amount of student
apathy found at Pitt. Letitia Arnold,
another society member, said
“undergraduates are too
uninvolved. I wouldn’t say there
is an extremely apathetic
atmosphere, but there is always
room for improvement.” '

Society member Andi John
agreed that apathy is a problem.
“We are somewhat lacking in
school spirit, and I think the Blue
and Gold Society can really
change that,” she said.

himself publicly against his
accusers.

President of the Faculty
Assembly Richard Tobias said
that the purpose of closed
hearings is to protect
confidentiality of the accused
and accusers, but he said there
is no reason to hold private
hearings in the Needleman
case since all parties
concerned have already
discussed the matter
publicly.

“The Faculty Assembly,
Senate Council and the full
Senate urged [that the
hearings] be open,” Tobias
said. _

“I think it's a very good sign
when the administration
listens to the faculty and
acknowledges that academic
processes need to be done in
the daylight,” Needleman said.

Needleman had originally
pursued a lawsuit to insure
that he did have open
hearings. <

SET protestors refuse to pay ﬁnes for civil disobedience 

By Ethan Lott
For, T be Pitt News

Three local protesters, arrested in
February for deﬁant trespass, are refusing
to pay their $155 fines. Bench warrants
may be issued as early as today.

Vincent Eirene, Glen Grodin and Pitt
student Cassi Geier were arrested while
protesting in front of CMU’s Software
Engineering Institute on February 13, the
one year anniversary of the United States’
bombing of the Ameriya Shelter in Iraq in
which 517 civilians died.

I The protest was held at SE1 because
software designed at SE1 was used in the
bombs used in the attacks.

Grodin said that while over 50 people
attended the rally and stayed all night in
the sub-zero weather, only three were
arrested because they sat on the steps of
SE1, which is not allowed, and refused
to leave as an act of civil
disobedience.

All three said there was no question as
to whether or not to pay the fine.

“Certainly not," Geier said. “My problem
is with the system and 1 don’t see why I
should pay into a system I feel is wrong,
and 1 also don’t see what 1 did as
wrong.”

“Not paying the fine is an act of civil
disobedience and a service to the
community,” Eirene said. “We give enough
money —— $200 million for Desert
Storm.”

‘‘I believe we’re innocent and paying a
fine would be an admission of guilt,”
Grodin said. “The system is guilty. The
system allows for the military buildup
and research that goes on at SE1,

which was clearly linked to the Gulf '

War.” .

Grodin said that according to CMU’s
Focus Magazine, which is a faculty
publication, software systems on all of the
aircraft carriers used in the gulf war were
designed at SE1.

“1 don’t think this is higher education,”
Eirene said.

Erin Bush, a senior at Pitt and a member
of Pitt Students for Peace, also attended
the rally.

She said SE1 was chosen because it is
totally funded by the military, which she
said is ﬁscally unsound and threatens the
school’s academic freedoms.

“1 don’t think anyone should be building
these weapons and I certainly don’t think
it should happen in colleges,” she said.
“CMU is dependent on military funds.
Eighty percent of funding for the computer
science department comes from the
Department of Defense which controls
what they do,” Bush said.

She said this money must be spent on
military research because the Mendohlson
Act of 1972 said research and development
monies must have clear military
applications.

She added that Pitt is also getting involved

Pitt students to march
to ‘TakeBack theNz’ght’

By Julie saboi

Asst. News Editor

To protest crime and show the community that they are
concerned with safety on and around Pitt’s campus, students
will “Take Back The Night” with a candle-carrying march
through Oakland tonight.

“This is an excellent way for the greatest amount of students
to get involved, to join everybody’s voices together to protest
and show that we are concerned with safety)" Student Government
Board member and coordinator of the march»Derrick St. Clair
said.

Students and faculty will meet in Schenley Quadrangle at 8:30
when candles will be distributed. Public-safety escorts will then
lead the group on a 30- to 45-minute march through Oakland.

“I want all students to get involved. It's not going to take up '

much time. It’s something minor students can join together and
do, but the impact is much greater than the input,” St. Clair said.
“The more participation, the greater impact the program will
have.”

The march was formulated in the wake of recent crimes that
have occurred on and around campus, according to St. Clair.

Pitt students Holly Callender and Cathy Goldstein took the
plan to the SGB, where it'was organized, but St. Clairemphasized
that it is not sponsored by the’SGB — it is sponsored by the
students of the university.

Though many students go out on Thursday nights and many
have night classes, the march will not interfere with either, St.
Clair said. i

“I scheduled it after night classes and before most people go
out. At the very least it’s an opportunity for students to get
together for a good cause. It will also be fun,” he said.

History prof stresses writing skills

By Rebecca Baker
Stag‘ Writer

William Stanton remembers the
first time he laid eyes on
Pittsburgh: “It was Winter 1943. I
came here as a deck hand on a
landing ship tank in World War
II. It was an ugly, nasty, dirty city
—— a real shocker to an 18-year-
old.” Nearly two decades later,
Stanton came back to a cleaner
city as an assistant professor of
history at the University of
Pittsburgh.

“At the time, Pitt was under the
Litchfield regime and just starting
to make a name for itself,” he
said

Stanton has had a quiet 50
years in Pitt’s history department.

CWO notjustfor women, say men

I said. .
BIGALA Co-President and

By Christine Hanna
News Assistant

Students may think that only
women are involved in the
Campus Women’s Organization,
but that is not true.

According to member Adam

I Novak, there are five to eight men

who regularly attend CWO
meetings. ‘

“I think it is hard at first for men
to get involved [in CWO], but it is
important because it is the men
who are oppressing women. I am
taking my place in society as
being an oppressor of women
and I am rejecting it,” Novak

“Everyone in the offices gets
along, and the bureaucracy leaves
me alone to write. Being left
alone to write my books is the
best part of my job,” he said.‘

In the teaching aspect of his
work, Stanton said, he believes
in elitism, or teaching to a small
number of his students. “Usually
I focus my attention on the top 10
percent of the class. The rest
have to fend for themselves,” he
said.

A Texas native, Stanton
received his undergraduate
degree at Baylor. He earned his
master’s at Brown in 1956. He
taught one year at the University
of Puerto Rico, then two more
years at Michigan State, a place
he called “a cow college that

CWO memberTodd Kinavey said

that men can be involved in.

women’s rights. During the civil
rights movement there was
support from white people which
helped make it successful.
“Anything that breaks down
barriers and destroys stereotypes
is beneficial. I think it is definitely
important for men to be involved
in the women’s rights movement,”
Kinavey said.

“I think that it is important for
men to be involved in CWO
because women can only achieve
equality when each sex respects

prided itself on mobile homes.”
After teaching in Massachusetts
and Dublin, Pitt finally became
his home in-1962.

Although enrollment sharply
increased in the history
department, Stanton seems to
discourage students‘ from
majoring in it. ‘‘All you can do
with history is be fond of it. It’s
really quite worthless. Major in
pre—med or business. That's where
the money is. Pay no attention to
the dead.”

However if a student insists on
pursuing history, a career is not
hopeless. According to Stanton,
students must have two things to
succeed in the field.

A One is the ability to write.

one another," CWO Co-President
Holly Callender said.

Member Daniel Kadane Crane
said that issues of equality are
important to all members of
society. He said that his presence
at CWO meetings can help
women avoid feeling alienation
which, unfortunately, is all too
easy to get when struggling for
their rights.

Arthur Nunes said that he joined
CWO because of the Pro—Choice
rally in Washington, D.C.

Callender said that men have a
great amount to gain personally
from the women’s liberation
movement.

Society
Continued from page 2

Students desiring to become
members of the society had to
first submit an application along
with three letters of recom-
mendation. The applicants were
then interviewed by a panel and
from there the 19 members were
chosen.

Toni Crary, who was chosen,
said she wasn’t very nervous
about the interview. “It was very
conversational, and had a relaxed
atmosphere.”

All of the society members are
already active in other campus
activities, but member Erin
Rodgers said that her new respon-
sibilities won’t interfere with her
schedule. “If you want to do
something enough, you can make
time for it. You just need good
time managementskills, ” she said.

Stanton remembered one
student who stood out “head and

class because the person learned
to write well. This student is now
a clerk for a Supreme Court justice.
“At times [learning to write] turns

'Fz’ghtz°ngfz’res

Throughout the United States, state and local services

' face extinction.

Today the City of Pittsburgh will decide the fate of
Firehouse 14. Located on the corner of Mckee Place and
Lousia Street, Oakland’s only water-carrying firetruck is
up for grabs. A

An independent study last year caused controversy

‘ when it suggested moving the pumper -truck at Firehouse

14 and axing firefighting equipment at sites throughout
the city to cut costs. '

Without an Oakland water—pumper truck, calls would
have to be answered by Allequippa Street.’s station. This
station is located far behind Trees Hall — at the very end
of Allequippa Street.

Now small fires could become disasters. According to

' Firehouse 14 Captain Bryan Devine, “Instead of being a

one-alarm fire that we catch in one room, now we are
going to lose the whole building. If they get another
minute to go, we'll get a big fire and maybe injuries or
fatalities.” * ' ' ‘ '

On the table, Mayor Sophie Masloffs budget would

eliminate the pumper truck but save a‘ ladder truck.

South Oakland residents have cause for concern. Action
has been taken by university students and the Oakland
community demonstrating concern. ,

Now the public may be put in danger. But the problem
is more than the issue of the mayor’s ‘budget cuts. For
many years large, urban areas throughout the United
States have faced budgetary crises. _

The federal government's priorities have not included
cities and domestic services. It's time we address the
needs in our own backyard.

Take back the night?

Tonight, the Student Government Board’s Public Safety
Committee organized “Take Back the Night” will march
through North and South Oakland. Carrying candles,
participants I will kick off from Schenley Quadrangle
starting at 8:30 p.m._ Its message is that the university
community, in particular students, are outraged at violence
in Oakland.

A few weeks ago, a Pitt student was raped on her way
home. Two days before the attack, two Pitt students were
robbed at gunpoint. A.few.months ag-o, -Oakland businesses
were robbed at gunpoint. Violence is -a part of life here in
Oakland.

The Public Safety Committee is sponsoring the Take
Back the Night march in the hopes that it will send a strong
message of anger. Without a strong. grassroots "effort to
incorporate all areas and communities on campus, success
is doubtful. Anger must be focused on the problems. More

~ police, more laws and more regulations will not necessarily

make Oakland or any community safer. It is only one step.

Differential treatment just

Bias or hate crimes'— crimes
motivated on the basis of some
category, for instance‘ religion -
are receiving more attention from
the media on the local, state and
national level. L

In the past five years, various
leaders in the civil-rights
community have begun to address
violence directed at their
constituencies as a civil-rights
issue.

It has never been unusual to

hear iaboulélai cross burned on a,
lawn orswastikas‘ painted on a

synagogue. But now action is
being taken, Speciﬁcally, the Anti-
Defamation league of B’nai B’rith
Hillel, the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force and the Center
for Democratic Renewal have
long ‘argued for action against

violence motivated by hatred.

against social groups. _
Legislative action led to the
adoption of the 1990 Hate Crimes
and Statistic,s,_.,_,A_ct.. Congress
approved the legislation to
monitor crimes on the basis of
race, sexual orientation, religion,
national origin and ethnicity.
Under the U.S.
Department, these records are
collected and tabulated, and
information is made available to
the public. To facilitate these
efforts, the Justice Department
set up a toll-free number (1-800-
347-HATE) for individuals to
report racial and ethnic tension
and anti-gay violence in
communities. '
At the local level, law-
enforcement agencies have begun
to record crimes motivated on
the basis of race, sexual
orientation, religion or ethnicity.
Data collected in New York City,
Boston and Los Angeles, all of
which have been collecting
statistics for several years now,
show that anti—bias crimes are on
the rise.
- On the state level, legislatures
in Connecticut, Massachusetts and

Jusuce"

California passed legislation
regarding hate-motivated crimes.
Pressure to pass anti—bias crime
legislation has been mounting in
the New York state legislature

_ since 1988.
Each year the state assembly

Mark
Smith

has passed an anti—bias crime’ bill,
and every year the state Senate's
Republican leadership has stalled
and prevented its passage. The
bill this year, S.3126A, includes as
a bias-crime deﬁnition “crimes
committed to deprive an

‘ individual [of] Qivil-rights because

of race, creed, color, national
origin, sex, disability, age or
sexual orientation.”

It is considered comprehensive
——.— it would add criminal penalties
for bias-related crimes. Also, bias-
crime is defined as personal injury
or personal property damage and
acknowledges rape as a potential
bias crime. Including rape as a
bias crime has been a key area of
controversy for the legislation.

On March 20, the assembly
passed the anti—bias bill.

Opposition in the senate stems
from senate majority leader Ralph
Marino (R-Oyster Bay). He has
proposed an anti-crime bill as an
alternative. Opposing hate/bias-
crime legislation, Marino argues
that all victims are the same in
society; punishment should be
the same. He goes on to add that
anti-bias legislation puts
prosecutors through an extra
burden of having to prove hate is

‘inside a person's head. Some

support for the legislation is

weakened with the inclusion of '

rape as a possible bias-related
crime.’ '

No action is clearly not an
option that should be followed.
Ignoring hate violence ignores

the real danger for many
oppressed social groups.

_ Marino’s alternative crime bill
does not address the civil-rights
needs of
disadvantaged peoples. While an
anti-crime bill may be helpful in
its own right, it does not address
bias—based violence.

Excluding rape as a bias crime

v will not address a significant hate

crime. Some people express

violent feelings through rape —
not through assault. Some people
choose to deprive their victims of
their civil rights by raping them —

not by hitting them. Including.

rape as bias crime will not indicate
all rapes are bias-related. But in

_ many cases, it can be argued rape

is an attack against women by
men motivated by misogyny.

Proving an offender’s intent is
standard fare for prosecutors. The
fact that prosecutors already seek’
intent challenges Marino’s claim
of an extra burden on prosecutors.
Already, the bias-crime legislation
is supported‘ by the attorney
general of New York.

.» It is likely that the inclusion of
sex in the legislation will add
some resistance by the senate’s
Republican leadership even
though it has bipartisan support
in the assembly. 9

Sen. Marino has opposed the
legislation in the past because.he

"rejects the legislative attempt to

classify gay bashing as a hate
crime, according to the civil-rights
organizations.

Our society takes the position
that some actions are more
heinous than others. Special
criminal penalties apply for
assaulting members of the federal
judiciary. Applying the same
rationale to historically
disadvantaged and oppressed
groups is only fair in a world
hostile to their presence.

Staff Writer

After a successful series agains
Providence last weekend, the Pitt Panthe 
baseball team got a visit from the ghost o 
the past, falling victim to the West Virginia
Mountaineers. The Panthers lost both ‘
games, S-0 and 10-2. .

One of Pitt’s goals this season was to
improve its record from last year’s 15-30,
and it seemed well on its way at 14-8. Much-
improved pitching has been helping Pitt:
forget the failure of past seasons, but West
Virginia’s (10-11) bats awoke the dreaming
Panthers.

Pitt head coach Mark Jackson had no
explanation for Pitt’s poor play. “It’s hard to
explain why a team can play well one day
and bad another,” Jackson said. “West
Virginia played very relaxed, and when
you’re relaxed you play well.”

Panther lefty Bob Hanawalt got off to a
rocky start in the first game, giving up a
first-inning homer to the Mountaineers’ third
baseman, Dan Vasalani. After giving up a
double two batters later, Hanawalt made a
throwing error while trying to pick off Mike
O’Neill, scoring O’Neill and giving WVU a
2-0 lead. V .

Pitt’s bats seemed to disappear after this
weekend, stranding men at second and
third in the bottom of the first and a man on
third in the bottom of the second. Those
were the only sparks for Pitt, which had to
settle for only four hits. After Hanawalt
gave up two more runs in the fourth, WVU
ran away with the first game. A

Things didn’t change in the second game
for Pitt. WVU got out to a quick lead after
Pittthird baseman Greg Christman booted
a grounder by Vasalani, who scored on a i

back quickly in the fourth with four runs and
two more in the fifth. Pitt never had a chance
as WVU’s pitching shut down Pitt and went on
to a 10-2 win.

Jackson said his team shouldn't have had a
letdown following the Providence series. “The
team had two days" off,” Jackson said. “[Pittl
should always be ready to play, no matter
who the other team is.”

Jackson attributed Pitt’s loss to good WVU
pitching and bad pitch selection by his hurlers.
“They were good, but I know we can hit
better,” Jackson said.

In the sixth inning of the second game,
Jackson pulled all nine players and replaced,
them. Although it seemed to bea sign of
frustration, Jackson said it was to give other
players a chance. “The 2S—man roster for Big
East play can be changed, so we give the guys
time to show what they got,” Jackson said.

prrr BITS: Pitt shortstop Josh Tyler and
pitcher Bi1lJunker were named Big East player
and co—pitcher of the week. Tyler, only a first-
year player, was 6-9 (.667 BA) with six runs

Weekend features
alumni grid games

By Brian Gallagher
Staff Writer

The names are synonymous with
the Pitt football legacy —— Dorsett,
Cavanaugh, Covert, Schottenheimer,
Fralic and “Special Delivery” Jones.
Their exploits on the Pitt Stadium
field will be forever rehashed and
remembered in the memory banks
of Panther fans of all ages. And for
one weekend, the memories of the

past reunite with the men who_

created them.

More than 140 former Pitt football
players are expected to reunite on
Cardiac Hill this Saturday for the first
annual Pitt Football Alumni

~ Weekend. The schedule of festivities
‘for the former greats includes an

alumni flag—football game prior to
the annual Blue—Gold game at the
stadium, a pregame tailgate party,
and postgame autograph session.
The full day» of events concludes
with an evening reception hosted by
Pitt head coach Paul Hackett and
Athletic Director Oval Jaynes.‘

The game and activities will be the
first of its kind at Pitt, according to
football administrative assistant Alex
Kramer, who was responsible for
organizing the weekend.

“This is going to be the first of an
annual event,” Kramer said. “Other

‘ than the varsity letterman’s banquet

during homecoming. weekend, this
isthe first event of its kind here.
“We have a great diversity in
regards to" people who have worked
with different coaches and in different
eras, and yet they all have the
common denominator of _a deep
affection for the university and for

0 Pitt football. It should be a great

afternoon and evening, ” Kramer said.

A 1952 Pitt graduate and former
student football manager, Kramer
noted that the only other prior alumni

get—togethers were full—contact
football games involving former and
current Panther players during the
late 703.

“We used to have an alum game as
the spring game. The current squad
played a team of alumni in an actual
game.”

“In fact, in ’79 or ’80 Herb
McCracken, a great player under
Pop Warner in 1921, was in his 80s
and suited up. He wasn’t hit, but he

had the ball pitched back and ran a

little.’’ *
Among the 140-plus players
returning to Pittsburgh this weekend
include players from each of the last
seven decades: Jim Sweeney, Nick
Bolkovac, Ron Delﬁne, Bill Maas,
Bill Fralic, Ralph Cindrich and Tom

Flynn to name just a few.- Among the ’

all~time greats unable to attend are
Mike Ditka (hip replacement), Dan
Marino (previous commitment) and
Hugh Green.

The men responsible for creating
this reunion are Jaynes and Hackett,
whom Kramer said both hold strong
convictions when it comes to
remembering and "including past
Panther alums with the current
activities of the 1992 Pitt team.

“They Want the support of the
alums,”'Krarner said. “They want our
former players’ to feel that ‘This is
their home.’ This is a perfect
opportunity for that to happen.“ .

accommodations will fall on the 

of the alums themselves with the ‘

athletic department providing the
role as host of the weekend's events.
In addition to the pride and tradition

activities will also encourage many

Faciflities, mterestfactors determining varsitystatus

By John Labriola

' Stajf Writer

(Second in a two-part series)

Although funding is the first.
stumbling block for clubs that
wish to become varsity sports,
there are also other concerns.
The cost of insurance and the
availability of facilities and
competition are also important
determining factors.

One of the athletic departrnent’s
high-increase areas, health care,
is due to the increase in insurance
rates. In college athletics, injuries
are a common occurrence. When
considering sports injuries, most
people would think that football
would lead the list of participants
injured.

Surprisingly, one of the highest?
risk sports per participant from
the injury standpoint is
gymnastics, both men’s and
women’s. Wrestling follows a
close second for the number of
injuries as it relates to the number
of participants. That is a factor
because of the insurance costs

' _and medical costs to handle those

sports. Those costs have gone up
tremendously in this country.

Pitt has only dropped four
sports in the -last 20 years. Pitt
dropped water polo, golf, men’s
volleyball ' and women’s field
hockey. Jaynes-said that each of
these sports was dropped
predominantly because of
competition and -funding.

In the case of water polo, he

said, “Water polo is basically a '

west coast sport. There are less

than 50 teams in the country that
compete now in water polo, and
it is losing its status as a team that
the NCAA sponsors a

championship for.”

Jaynes said that golf is a hard
sport to maintain at an urban
campus because of the space that
is needed to play the game. He
said he feels the Schenley Golf
Course, where the sport could be
played, would probably be used
as a place to practice since the
university does not have a golf
course or a place where the
students can actually practice.

Because Pitt does not own a
golf course, Jaynes said he feels
that it" probably became cost

prohibitive to maintain the sport.
A lot of private clubs will not
allow a team toplay or practice
without .a membership. Those
memberships are quite expensive.
The second problem, Jaynes
said, is weather in Pittsburgh. In

~ Pennsylvania four to five months

of golf season is frozen, and most
of the good golf programs are in
the South or in the sun belt.

One of the sports that Pitt
dropped, volleyball, thrives in all
areas of the country.

Men’s volleyball, however, is
not as popular as it once was.
There are very few teams in the
Northeast, and basically men’s
volleyball is a West Coast sport.
East of the Mississippi there are
two predominantly good teams:
Penn State and Ball State.

According to Jaynes, in
California and Colorado men’s
volleyball is a big sport, but when
you come across the Mississippi,
men’s volleyball is not very
popular. As it is not a heavily
emphasized sport, there are not
that many teams to compete
against. The team would have to
go so far for competition that it

becomes cost prohibitory to have
that kind of sport. The Big East
conference does not have a
volleyball championship for men.
It does for women, and women’s
volleyball has become very
competitive in the Big East.

Jaynes said he also feels that
because Pitt is an urban school
there is not too much space
available for a lot of field sports.
Women’s field hockey was
probably dropped because of
space availability. Pitt is restricted
to its number of outdoor facilities,
so it is restricted with the types of
sports that it can have.

Another sport" that Jaynes
looked at was ice hockey.

“Ice hockey is a great sport,”
Jaynes said. “We don't have an
ice rink on campus, and to rent
ice time or to try to get into the
arena to have an ice—hockey
program is just too expensive.”

Since Pitt does not have _the
facilities to compete with other
varsity ice-hockey programs,
Jaynes said he feels that it would
be difficult for Pitt to support an
ice—hockey program.

“When you look at the schools,

around the country — like

Bowling Green, Michigan State,
Boston College or some of the
Ivy ‘League schools — all of those
places have their-own ice rinks,
and it: makesa difference,” Jaynes
said." - A
There are only four conferences
forice hockey in the country, and
there are only about 50 or 60
schools in the country that have
ice-hockey programs. Since there

are not very many teams, the cost

of traveling for competitions
would be too expensive. Another
drawback is that the Big East

"does not sponsor an ice-hockey

championship.

The Big East sponsors
championships for sports that are
represented by more than 50
percent of the schools in the
conference. They are men’s and
women’s tennis, men’s and
women’s golf, men’s and
women’s cross-country, men's
and women’s indoor and outdoor
track, men’s and women’s

swimming and diving, men’s and’

women’s basketball, _softball,
baseball, soccer, women’s field‘

acknowledges but downplays.

“I think there is no ulterior
motive, but there is some of
both of that. [Soliciting funds}
is not the spirit of the reunion,”
said Kramer.

The same sentiment was
echoed by one of the Golden
Panthers’ coordinators, Jana
Gordon, who stressed the
purpose of the event as being
enjoyable for alums and fans
alike.

“While we certainly hope
for some [contributions], the
game is mostly for the
university.”

In addition to reuniting old
teammates and conjuring past
glories, the game will also
serve as an example for present
and future players of Pitt's rich
football history.

“We want our present squad
to, in a sense, be infected and
affected by the spirit of the
great Pitt football tradition,”
Kramer said, adding at the
same time the alums can
educate the present Pitt stars
about the importance of a
college education and life after
football.

Kramer said he is looking
forward to seeing all of the
players, but when pressed to
single out the return of an
individual Pitt grad he most
anticipates, “T.D.” was his
choice.

“I always like to see Tony
Dorsett on campus,” he said.

The flag football games (pre-
1970 game, post-1970 game)
begins at 2 p.m. with the Blue-
Gold game set to kick off at 4
p.m. Admission is free.

Varsity

Continued from page 7
hockey and women’s volleyball..

Very few schools would add a
sport where basically you don’t
have anyone to play, ” jaynes said.

When adding a sport to the
athletic departrnent’s ranks, one
of the largest considerations is
interest in the sport. One of the
sports that Jaynes said he likes to
watch, lacrosse, is very popular
in the Northeast, and there are
more lacrosse teams inlthe
Northeast than anywhere else.

Bringing in Lacrosse would
make some sense if Pitt were
going to add a sport because of
the regional interest in the
program. Interest in the sport is
something that should be taken
into consideration.

If Pitt were to bring lacrosse in
as a varsity sport, it would certainly
have strong teams to compete
against.

“I know that Syracuse has a
fairly strong lacrosse program,”
Jaynes said, “and of course Johns
Hopkins [and] some of the Ivy
League schools that are very

THE PI'I'I' NEWS, Thursday, April 9, 1992

strong.”

Another reason that it would
be hard for Pitt to add an
additional sport is practice
schedules. Under Title IX of the
civil-rights bill, which dealt with
providing an equitable number
of programs for women,
comparable practice times and
space must be provided for all
varsity sports. The university’s
facilities are also utilized by clubs.

“I go out and watch lacrosse
practice in the stadium every
night,” Jaynes said. “A lot of the
club sports utilize the athletic
facilities. I enjoy lacrosse. It’s not
part of our program, but it is a
part of the university’s program
as it relates to the intramurals
and club sports.” ’ .

Space is always a problem
when you have a number of
teams on an urban campus. The
athletic department tries to utilize
all of Pitt’s facilities to their
maximum potential.

“We have to provide practice
time for, varsity sports that
represent the university,” Jaynes

 

said. “They have first priority,
and then we utilize the space
available for the others as much
as we possibly can.”

Pitt’s facilities are used for the
four different areas:

1. academic programs (health

and recreation, as far as teaching,

is concerned);

2. intercollegiate athletics;

' 3. recreation, intramurals and
club sports; '

4. wellness programs and fitness
programs run through the school
of education and leisure activities.

One of the biggest areas utilized
by the students and faculty as
well as athletes are Pitt’s weight
rooms.

“We really need an area for our
students,” Jaynes said. “They need
their own student—activities center,
where they can come‘ and have
their own weight room.

“I am very committed, and I
think the institution is very
committed to providing the best
possible environment for a
student~athlete as it relates to
competition,” he said.

r-“

By MC Lingo’ 0
-Sta_[)'' Writer

Let's fuse facts. First off, alleged
space-hero Isaac, err, Asimov is,
‘ lessay, uh, d—e—a-d, dead. And
what he knew about space is
mathematically, uh, zero in
comparison to the facts. Let's call
them The Ex, who’ve been
pushing the edges and limits of
space and non-linear polyrhythms
for over a decade.
Formed in the late ’70s in that
punk-pu ng-rock era, The Ex were

, more dogmatic in a political sense

than any of their counterparts.
The.y took equal stand with
politico—anarchist mumblings via
Crass. The Ex have opted always
to release their records themselves
with extreme detail to packaging
and distributing their information.
Most records contain finely
produced booklets of political
ranyings, swell photos, etc 
Their militant politics have always
been at the forefront: pro-labor,
socialist bent shoutings with a
very anti-imperialistic, pro-
squatter mindframe. Swell by me,
eh?

Now musically The ‘Ex have

never produced a well—thought-
out plan. Instead they choose to
set the music in an often
improvised, free-rock-jazz format:
a tight web of chinka—chinka
guitar; fat, scatological bass and
nearly tribal poly-polyrhythmic
(yet keenly sparse) drum work.
Sound like King Crimson? Not a
chance. They come off like a
mutated, electro-heavy
juggernaut, redeﬁning the word
“folk” for Third World militant
uprisings all over our fair globe.
Their high points until recently
were two incredible double LPs,
Too Many Cowboys (1987) and
Joggers And Smoggers (1989).
Both are complete epic forays
into areas of music unconceived
of by rock, jazz or art—rock worlds.
Full-on, detuned, off—rock
numbers mingle with tinkly,
atmospheric parameters in a fine
-blend of uncharted waters only
now being tested by the like-
minded Dog Faced Hermans.
Years and many singles later,
The Ex team up with avant—cellist
extraordinaire, Tom Cora. Cora’s
got a list of avant—savant musings

companion to The Ex on their
recent Scrahbling/U The LocleLP.

The band and Cora reveal
mammoth doses of'psuedo-

mingled. with the regular, off-

Ex-fare. The two blend and
intermingle in a whole that is far
greater than its parts. “State Of
Shock,” “Propaganda” and the
Turkish “Batium” scream and
twist like a deranged, Italian love

village musicians. Cora’s non-

the guitar buzz in a chamber-like
symphony that is, by gum,
unbelievable. _

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, April 9, 1992 S-3

No wading in Plyhousds big 'Bg River‘

By Lori M. Bossert
Staff Writer

Big River is a big show. Based on Mark Twain’s famous novel
Huclelebeny Firm, the play follows the many adventures of
Huckleberry Finn andJim, his guardian slave. Their runaway journey
down the Mississippi requires a large, talented cast and a competent
technical staff as well. The Playhouse Theater Company’s current
version proves them to be more than able ofhandling a large task and
handling it with ﬂair.

The play centers on Huckleberry Finn, played with starry-eyed
intensity by Gavan Palmer. Incredibly natural as Huck, Palmer
radiates a boyish enthusiasm for life and adventure which combines
well with his slow maturation throughout the show. Engagingly
boyish, he is excellent in the role. Palmer’s singing voice is a pleasant
tenor which succeeds the most on his ballad “Waiting for the Light
to Shine.”

Stacey Robinson is phenomenal as Jim, the runaway slave.
Robinson’s Jim is dignified and pathetic by turns and always faithful
to the role. His enormous voice fills the theater with rich dark tones
that feel as though they’ve come from the depths of the Mississippi
itself. He fills the character with an earthy life which is stunning to
watch as it unfolds. His performance in the climatic “Free At Last”
literally brought down the house with its power and melody.

The supporting cast is comprised of equally good actors and
singers. James Judy, as the the pompous Duke, and Robert DuSold
, a coarse King , make an enjoyable set of villains. Their performances
are reminiscent of a vaudeville team, particularly on the bouncy
“When the Sun Goes Down.” Tom Sawyer is played with an impish
delight by Steve Geyer, and Seana Kate Livingston sings sweetly as
MaryJane. Ron Lee Savin is both absurdly funny and truly menacing
as Pap Finn, Huck’s drunken father. His no—holds-barred rendition of
the bluesy “Guv’ment” is one of the show’s many highlights.

Perhaps the best choral numbers of the show are those sung by
the" slave’s ensemble. Their mournful intensity on spirituals like
“Crossing Over” creates a haunting picture of slavery not easily
forgotten. Soloists Sandra Dowe and Rema Webb both have strong,
ringing voices which were filled with melodic emotion that touched
the very soul. They were the most beautiful element of a show filled
with stunning images.

Every one of the 24 company members has ample chance to shine

Kleenex, I feel the urge to cuddle
and hug my neighbor. And
listening to this Love Child 7"
gives me the urge to bubble my
“P3” with hearts and giggle like a
school lass.

While the name may conjure
images of the product from a
certain season of fornication, the
sound is strictly pure and virtuous.
Bassist Rebecca Odes manages
the crystal vocals and Alan Licht
adds a burr of guitar. Drummer
Brendan O’Malley replaces Will
Baum (who played on previous
seven inchers and the OKAY?!
LP). The line—up hasn’t changed
the honesty and innocence that
these love, rock—revo1ution
forefronters produced on other
efforts. They’ve cleaned up the
recording and waxed up two
ditties that’ll warm yer heart and
put daisies in your fist.

“Six of One,” an Odes-penned
ballad, begins with crisp guitar

chords and sustains a mellow
drum march. Odes is a crooner
and she maintains her clear,»
saccharine Octave—steady voice
on such pearls o’ wizdom as
“why do they always expect me
to see/something just because
it’s standing right in front of
me/when I don't wanna see?”
Add an emotional, whining buzz
of a guitar and you got yerself a
real tear—jerker.

“Sleepyhead” is faster and
more “complex” than the A side.
A more sultry and adult Odes
demands: “Let me have a drink
of water/Let me have a drink of
beer/...Wake me up when I am
settled down/I can’t stand
anymore of this/Foolin’
around.” She may talk like a
grown—up, but she still sounds
like Holly Hobbie. ,

I like the chastity of Love
Child, and I like the warmth
that Spreads over my nekkid

While Love Child scratched my

So I played this 7" without the
much necessary 7" plastic insert

sound like a bomb siren was

Ride
Going Blank Again
Sire/ Re prise

Ride burst on to the scene three
years ago, a product of England’s
independent Creation Records
label. Following in the footsteps
of My Bloody Valentine and The
Telescopes, Ride is occasionally
lumped in with British success
stories like the Jesus and Mary
Chain due to its buzzsaw guitar
melodies. But with influences
ranging from the Beatles to
Dinosaur Jr. to Galaxie 500 to
Sonic Youth to Big Star, Ride’s
blend of ’60s sounds and
psychedelic, wah-wah guitar
gives it a place all its own. Ride
stands at the head of the
“shoegazers”' movement on the
British scene.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The self—titled debut EP,
released in December 1989,
featured the scorching feedback-
driven single “Chelsea Girl” as
well as the plodding, bass—heavy
“Drive Blind.” Ride released
another EP, Play, in the summer
of ’90, featuring its-first big single,
“Like A Daydream.” The two EPs
were combined for Ride’s first
American release, the Smile LP.
Despite the title, much of Ride’s
music is anything but happy or
uplifting. But vocalist/guitarists
Mark Gardener and Andy Bell
make being sad OK, for a little
while anyway.

The first full-length album,
Nowhere, blended the noise with
softer, impressionistic guitar and
vocals on “Paralysed” and “In A
Different Place.” The lyrics don’t
appear to have one set direction,
just a lot of heartfelt emotions.
Gardener ﬂoats softly through any
subject, from seagulls tosuicide.
Ride gained major acclaim with
singles “Taste” and Vapour Trail.”

Going Blan/eAgaz'n, the follow-
up to Nowhere, doesn’t offer
anything particularly new or
different, but Ride churns out
some tantalizing efforts,
nonetheless.

The first single, “Leave Them
All Behind,” is a haunting journey,
beginning with pulsating organ
effects reminiscent of The Who’s
“Baba O’Riley.” Steve Queralt’s
surging, constant bassline drives
Ride while quickly kicking into
wailing, guitar noise, elevating

the music to a layered fullness
that hasbeen constant during the
early efforts. But this tune elevates
that wall of sound to new
volumes. Lars Colbert’s heavy
drums feed off his
characteristically syncopated
backbeats and reverberating ﬁlls.
Atop this landscape are
Gardener’s dreamy vocals, which
fluctuate from soft to piercing
amid varying ascending levels.

“I don’t care about colours/I
don’t care about light/ I don’t care
about the truth.”

Bassist Queralt and drummer
Colbert push the tune along,
offsetting the overwhelming,
fuzzy backdrop. The noise is so
full that at the end of it, you feel
almost a release of energy.

“Twisterella” is a basic, light,

pop tune driven by upbeat guitar '

melodies — too light and not

vocals are showcased on “Not

fills and crisp guitars. Gardener
and Bell have similar fluctuating,
yawning voices, which makes it
difficult to sometimes decipher
exactly who is singing lead and
who is backing.

The finest track on the LP is
“Chrome Waves,” an eerie, icy,
picturesque walk. It begins with
something foreign to Ride:
acoustic guitar. Colbert enters,
soon to be followed by droning,
haunting synth in the vein of
early Echo and the Bunnymen.
Bell's misty vocals reflect a
tortured, distraught soul.

“This strange machinery/is

gray, gloomy day. Gardener says
that Ride uses the noise to

with these guys it’s usually moody.
Their lyrics are ambiguous,
though always dreamy, and Bell
says escapism is the common
thread.

Rushin’ you like a defensive
end, Gang Starr joins Digital
Underground and Raw Fusion
for a rare, hip-hop triangle tonight
at the Metropol. Despite the fact

-that Starr’ll most likely open

tonight’s show, there is no
denying who the true rappers are
on this bill.

Bursting on to the scene in
1988 with “Believe Dat,” sportin’
an inspiring Average White Band
sample, Keith E.E. and DJ Premier
came out like they were always
in there. But it wasn't until the
piano-laden “Manifest” single
from their debut LP on Wild Pitch
Records that Gang'Starr started
earnin’ respect. From there it's

been nothin’ but major props for
the duo, culminating with last
year’s Step In The Arena wax on
the major, Chrysalis records.

“Heatin’ up like a thermostat,”
Gang Starr is the epitome of street
beat. Combining hype drum
tracks with Premier’s patented,
classic, scratch ‘n’ sniff choruses
and the unmistakable flow and
tongue of Keith E.E. (aka. The
Guru), Starr falls on the right side
of the urban tracks with positive
messages, both musically and
vibe-wise.

Step In The Arena produced
three smash singles — from the
first, “Just To Get A Rep,” with its
anti—gang message to the sappy
but sweet “Lovesick” and the title
track with its call to arms of
sucker MCs and Djs. Along the

way fans were treated to some
slammin’ B—side remixes,
including the magnetic big beat
and horn loop of “Check The
Technique.” Production-wise, few
can match the duo’s skills as they
parlay piano and brass loops over
beats that range from 808 boom

to subtler grooves, perfecting a‘

true, jazzy feel that many imitate

but very few can get with. Besides A

their own efforts, DJ Premier has
worked with Lord Finesse,
producing tracks on his raw
debut, and has had studio time
with Andre The Giant and
Showbiz.

Recently completing its own
studio work, Gang Starr is ready
to drop its third vinyl (and second
for Chrysalis) at the end of the
month, titled A Daily Operation.

1 Gctng Stctrr: Check the technique — they aint no Ringo

More immediate, though, is a cut
on the White Men Can’t Rap EP
entitled “Now Your Mine,” an EP
that sounds fat with new tracks
from Cypress Hill and the already
released Main Source cut, “Fakin’
The Funk.” The Guru and Premier,
always blessed with the dope
beats, dance—your—ass-off hops.
Check the technique. 1

Of significantly less importance
but nevertheless headlining the
bill is Bay Area Parliament biter
Digital Underground, fresh off
the crossover success’ of “Kiss
You Back.” DU blew up nearly
two years ago with the “Humpty
Dance,” a jam so played it still
sees commercial radio time. In
fact, DU has scored all over the
charts with various cuts, and with
the exception of Naughty By
Nature (A la “O.P.P.”) I would
choose them over all other
phonies as rap’s ambassadors to
the pop world, certainly an
appalling -idea but a realism,
regardless. Live, DU.busts out the

 

 

live instruments to add appeal,
but its engulfing, funkade1ic—

"snatched stage show is too

mainstream for even my white
boom.

If DU is the lesser of two evils,
then Raw Fusion is Gollum, the
boatmaster to hell. Forged from
Money B and DJ Fuze (both DU
members), it surprisingly sounds
a lot like the Underground minus
the blatant P—Funk vibe. The
debut, Live From the Styleetron
on Hollywood BASIC has
produced two singles, “Throw
Your ‘Hands In The Air" and
“Rockin’ To The P.M.” Neither of
these make you wanna do
anything but half-step.

Trick or Treat With City Theater’s Seventy Scenes

By Lori M. Bossert
Staﬂ“ Writer

Seventy Scenes ofHalloween, by
Jeffery Jones, is a mixed bag of
tricks and treats. Although the
acting and technical aspects are
excellent, as is always the case

"with the City Theater, they are

muddled by a script which
meanders, turns and wavers at
times.

The play explores the erosion
of Jeff and Joan’s marriage and
the concept of estrangement in a
series of 66 scenes. About the
gaps in communication between
the sexes, there are some funny,
telling moments evenly dispersed

' throughout the play. These are

never quite lost, but are
sometimes buried under other,
almost extraneous material. As
well, the play buckles under the
weight of some‘self—consciously
artistic scenes — a few of which
work very well but many of which
fall flat.

No matter what the scene, the

cast does very well with the
uneven material 'they’ve been
given. All four weave their way
through the play’s eclectic mix of
drama, dance, poetry and
performance art with grace and
skill.

Director Jed Allen Harris’
staging is excellent — he utilizes
the concept of distance to give a
good effect throughout the show,
bringing home the theme of
estrangement which governs the
show.

Douglas Rees, last seen in Miss
E1/er’s Boys, excels in the central
role ofJeff. He has a ﬁne dramatic
intensity and tension which is
highlighted in this production.
He is able to carry the serious and
lighter moments of the show
equally well, his mobile face and
to—the-limit physicality are one of
the better elements.

The role of Joan is played with
an understated honesty by Lori
Cardille. She never overplays a
role which has plenty of potential
for overkill. Rather, she performs

and “witch.” Part alter-egos for
Jeff and Joan and part
commentators on the play’s
action. They round out the cast
with good performances of off-
beat roles. Masked for the
majority of the performance, his
mastery of body language and
gesture is apparent. Aronson
projects a vulnerable beauty as
the witch, particularly during her
poetic monologues. The entire
cast makes the most of the script
and turns out a watchable

performance.

R.C. Baker’s lighting design
provides some colorful effects
during the show and creates
looming ‘shadows which
accentuate the action on stage.
Anne Thompson’s modernistic
black and white set is equally
well-suited to this production.
The show is also highlighted by
an eerie score composed by
Steven Sciulli, of local rock band
“Ploughman’s Lunch,” and
Michael Ketter.

Although not without its
problems, "Seventy Scenes of
Halloween” is still an enjoyable
evening of theater. It runs through

in this production. By and large a strong cast, there are few weak

_ performances. Over 40 characters are represented by the
chorus, whose transitions are remarkably seamless. They are
also strong vocally —— infusing the larger numbers with a great
deal of life and power.

I Anne Mundell’s set was gorgeous. A replica of the drop and
wing sets of Nineteenth Century Melodrama, it featured an
impressionistic Mississippi River which changed colors beautifully
under Jennifer Ford’s subtle lighting. Joan Markert’s daunting
task of costuming such a large show is also accomplished
perfectly.

The orchestra plays very well, although they sometimes
overpower the singers. The production was staged and
choreographed by director Edie Cowan, who has much to be
proud of with this version of Big River. ‘

overdriven tapestry over Queralt’s
bass.

“Cool Your Boots” reminds me
of a number of tracks off Nowhere,
beginning with fuzz-filled psycho-
reverb and quickly
complemented by a light, drifting
melody. The song builds into
total gushing psychedelia —— lots
ofguitar tracks echoing over one
another with Colbert hammering
away beneath Bell’s distressed
vocals:

“The smile beneath my hair/
Hangs lifeless in the air/Like_ a
net in water/I’m running through

it all/And I'm shuffling away/
With nothing more to say.

“Making Judy Smile” is one of
the weaker moments: a watered-
down, wasteful, pop song. This,
along with “Time Machine,” will
have Ride fans hollering, “Too
much pop; yuck!”

The record closes out with
“OX4,” an endearing, melodic

..ode to Ride’s hometown of

Oxford. The power chords are
backed by yet more dreamy synth,
while Gardener and Bell’s soft
vocals reflect their sappy
homesickness:

“Never been so far away/Just

Last year Ride emerged as one
of the brightest bands on the
English scene. It hasn’t broken
new ground here, but it hasn’t
done anything to discourage fans,
either.

By no means is Ride diverse. It
has no inkling of that. But if you
