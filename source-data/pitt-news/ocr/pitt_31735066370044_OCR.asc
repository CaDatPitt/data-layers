Concerned community members
joined Pitt students and faculty
members in an open forum debate to
deplore U.S. involvement in
Grenada.

Approximately 50 people
attended Saturday’s “Teach-In” in
Forbes Quadrangle, which focused
on last week’s invasion of Grenada.

The meeting was organized by the
Committee Against the Invasion of
Grenada._ Committee spokesperson
Gail Austin said the aim of the group
is to raise the consciousness of the
American people, to protest the
invasion and to support” the sover-
eignty of Grenada. . » '

According to Austin, the commit-
tee was organized within hours after
the invasion and, with the support of
other activist groups such as the
Thomas Merton Center, staged a
protest Tuesday in‘ front of the Fed-
eral Building.

Austin said that the U.S. press is
releasing distortions of the truth and
are stooges of the U.S. government;
this view was supported by many
who attended. When asked‘ to
explain the lack of protest by many

Barbados, Austin replied that such
nations were “puppets of the United
States government.” She also -con-
demned President Reagan for his
restraint of the press in Grenada and
emphasized" her circumspection of ,
American journalists.

"...another attack
in a long h_istory of
racist enslave-
ment, murder and
genocide..."

—GaiI Austin

Austin said she believes Reagan is
trying to keep the press from turning
public opinion against the war, as it
did in the latter part of the Vietnam-
ese war. , ‘

Austin opened up the teach-in by
reading a position paper which
applauded and included quotes
from assassinated Prime Minister
Maurice Bishop. A I

The paper stated that it is the aim
of the United States to “dominate
and control the third world.”

Austin added that the invasion

of racist enslavement, murder and

tin concluded her opening remarks
by raising her fist in the air and cal-
ling “long live therevolution-,..death
to U.S. imperialism.”

The main issue raised at the teach-
in was how to explain the U.S. pres-
ence in'Grenada.’

The position ‘echoed by attend-
ants was .a general feeling that the
students were not in any danger until
the troops arrived, thus creating an
artificial need” for protection from
the hazards the U.S. presence
brought with them. .

SGB Elections Waver

By PEGGY FERRI

The Student Government Board
(SGB) Elections Committee will
meet today to decide if a candidate’s
request that ballots be reprinted
could result in a postponement of
the elections.

In an emergency meeting last
night, several members of the SGB
recommended to rule in favor of
board candidate Avery Abrams’
request, citing_a clerical error in elec-
tion codes that is responsible for the
mix-up.

Abrams wants the ballots
reprinted to have the slate Coalition
for Cable Television in the Dorms
appear next to his name. According
to the most recent election code, the
name of a candidate with the name
of a slate may appear on the ballot,
but the candidate must give'a week's
notice to allow for printing. Abrams
and some board members have older
copies of the election code which
said instead that a candidate must
give only 48 hours notice.

All candidates were supposed to
have received an up-dated code in a

packet with all other election mate-\ A

rials; . ,

According to Abrams, the issue is
not the code, butthe administra-
tion’s involvement in the board elec-
tions. He maintains that Brady had
originally decided to reprint the bal-
lots in accordance with ‘Abrams’
request, but that assistant director of
student activities Joyce Giangarlo
“stopped it.”

Brady said he “categorically
denies” ever saying that he would
correct the ballots. He added that he
told Abrams that he (Brady) would
see what could be done and that
there would be no final decision
reached until today.

Rely Less On Doctors,
Times Journalist Says

By ANA PUGA
I
Americans should rely less on
doctors‘ care and" take better care of
themselves, Jane E. Brody, personal
health columnist for The New York
Times told an-audience of about 300
Thursday ‘ at a Carlow College
lecture. I

Fifty percent of the deaths in this -

country are related to diseases
caused by our lifestyle,” Brody said.
“We are succumbing to an insuffi-
cient reliance on ourselves.”

Half of American patients receive
no tangible benefits from doctors,
and 9 percent are actually made
worse by doctors’ care, according to
Brody. Further, two-thirds of all
illnesses are psychologically based
and are self-limiting, meaningthey
cure themselves with time, Brody
said.

“The doctor who tells you, ‘Take
two aspirin and call me in the morn-
ing,’ may be doing you a favor,”
Brodysaid.

Seven out of 10 Americans who
see doctors are women, Broady told
the mostly female audience. Though
she does.not advocate avoiding doc-
tors when one is genuinely ill, Brody
encouraged women to “Question
"those gods with silver necklaces
around their.necks. ‘Ask, ‘What's

 

wrongwith me? And how do you
know?’ And don’t quit asking until
you get answers you understand.”
By eating properly, exercising
daily and reducing stress, women

‘ can minimize their relianceon doc-

tors and take charge of their own
health,‘Brody argued.

“What matters to your health is
what you do, not what doctors do,”
Brody emphasized. ~ E

Eighty million Americans are 20
pounds or more overweight. Twenty
million Americans are on diets, and
20 million Americans are planning
to go on diets, according to Brody.
But rather than diet, one should per-
manently change one’s eating habits,
Brody suggested.

“A diet is something you go off to

go on. When you go off, you regain, ,

the weight you lost and thenyou are
a sitting duck for the next cockama-
mie diet you decide to go on,” Brody
warned. .
Three out of five calories in the
typical American diet are nutrition-
ally void of fats and sugars, Brody
pointed out. Since 60 percent of the
calories consumed in the country are
nutritionally empty, 40 percent of
their calories must give Americans
100 percent of their nutrients. But

on Ballot Technicality

Concerning Giangarlo’s involve-
ment in the matter, Brady said.she.
had never put a halt to any action.
He explained that if he needed any

approval for reprinting the ballots, it H

would have to come from the A110-
cations Committee.

He said the SGB office received a ,

call from Central Printing on Fri-
day, Oct. 27, and was told the prin-

ters were in the process of reprinting .

the ballots. No one knows who auth-

Asian
Studies  

By NANCY POPKIN

A grant of $1 million has -been
awarded to Pitt in endowment
for its Japanese studies program
by I2 Mitsubishi companies. .

The first installment of the
grant was made in August,-the
rest to be made over the next five
years. For now, the university
will use only the interest it earns
from the grant. _ It A

A counsel of faculty members
in Japanese and East Asian stu-
dies chaired by Dr. David Mills,
chairman of East Asian language
and literature, will decide how
the money will be allocated.

Mills indicated that it will go
for language study, undergradu-
ate and graduate study abroad»,
faculty research and expansion
of faculty. The companies put no
stipulations on the use of the
grant. . ..

Mills said that a gift from a
group of companies is not that
common. B_ut it is the third grant
from Japanese companies that
Pitt has received. Dr. Albeft C.
Van Dusen, vice-chancellor eme-
ritus, has been at work establish-

ing contacts with Japanese
companies for over l0 years.
This is the third grant that he has
helped the university acquire.
The first, from C. Itoh Com-
pany, was for $50 thousand in
1974. The second was given by
the Japanese Iron and Steel Fed-
eration for $1 million.

Van Dusen said that the
endowment will be used to
benefit both the campus and the
community through scholar-
ships, exchanges, additions to
the library and special programs.
This will provide a greater
sophistication of our under-
standing of Japan and vice
versa.

The Japanese studies program
offers courses on Japan through

different departments — lan-
guage, -history, international
education, anthropology - and
the university center for interna-
tional studies. The faculty is
under the direction of Professor
Keith Brown. '
Van Dusen believes that the
grant and expansion of the pro-
gram is important because Pitts-
burgh serves a great area of the
United States. Historically, these
grants went to the costal cities.
He believes that the grants
have been successful in establish-
ing Pittsburgh as a cultural, com-

, mercial and industrial center.

“It shows the dedication ofthe
university to the international
dimension and is a significant
asset ininternational programs,”
Van Dusen said.

Grenada Invasion Examined

continued from page one

Pitt Professor Richard Blackett,
black studies, provided a great
number of pertinent and hard facts
for discussion. Blackett emphasized
the controversial airstrip under con-
struction on the island.

According to Blackett, the asser-
tion that the primary support for the
airstrip came from Cuba is com-
pletely inaccurate. Great Britain
initiated a feasibility study to build
an airport to bolster tourism on the
island, Blackett said.

Blackett added that Grenada has
received millions of dollars in aid
from Arab Bloc nations and through
a recent loan from the International

Monetary Fund, of which the U.S. is

. Blackett said he believes debate,
however valid, limited solely to why
the U.S. invaded Grenada allows
many of the broader questions to go
unanswered.

Blackett expressed fears that the
West Indian troops fighting in Gren-
ada -will, upon their return home,
instigate more fighting. These
troops will act, he explained, in
response to what they perceive as

internationally accepted methods of ,

gaining power: bloody, revolutions
and invasions.

I The Pitt News, Monday, October 31, 1983'

By LISA S.R. MCCRACKEN

“The Chemical People,” a two
part series produced by WQED,
will air Tuesday, Nov. 2 and 9.
The show is co-hosted by first
lady Nancy Reagan and Michael
Landon. It asks for parent and
community involvement for the
prevention of drug and alcohol
abuse among teenagers. '

The introduction for “The
Chemical People" was aired
Thursday, Oct. 27. It was taped
in the East Room at the White
House while the next subsequent
segments were taped here in
Pittsburgh at the studios of
WQED. Among the distin-
guished guests at the White
House taping_were Mrs. Ginny
Thornburg, the governor’s wife;
Larry Grossman, head of the
Public Broadcasting System
(PBS); Dr. Henry VanDeusen,
vice-chancellor of the University
of Pittsburgh and chairman of
the board of WQED; and local
television personality Ricki
Wertz, who is involved with
community outreach for “The
Chemical People.”

“The Chemical People” is a
network of task forces developed

by the Coalition for Addictive
Diseases and WQED president
Lloyd Kaiser, involving over
2,000 volunteers. Their first
efforts were shown a year and a
half ago, when “The Chemical
People” aired as a nine-part ser-
ies for the benefit of the local
community. From it, 120 task

_ forces were created to help give

information and advice on drug
and alcohol abuse to Pittsburgh
and its surrounding communi-
ties. .
Now, the program is going
national. With the help of Nancy
Reagan and PBS stations across
the country, it will be aired in all
50 states and the territory of
Guam.

Known personalities have
been included in the broadcasts
to help encourage community
support. They are Bill Bixby,
Rita Moreno, Sandy Duncan,
Willie Stargell and Bruce Weitz,
best known as Belker from “Hill
Street Blues.”

Last Thursday’s broadcast
asked all concerned community
members “to watch the next two
parts of the series at one of the
10,491 town meetings to be held

in conjunction with the pro-,_

Nancy Reagan Tapes Show

gram.” After the broadcasts,
information will be made availa-
ble on how each community can
set up its own task force against
drug and alcohol abuse.

“The Chemical People,” asks
us to stop'“denying” the prob-
lem. “American young people
have the highest rate of drug and
alcohol abuse in the world."
According to the broadcast, “93
percent of‘high school seniors
drink. Of those, one half were
drunk in the last two weeks and 6
percent of the students drink
daily.”

Pittsburgh’s task forces are
currently “lobbying for new
school district policies and cur-
riculum to address drug and
alcohol abuse, asking parents to
sign pledge cards agreeing not to
serve alcohol to teenagers and
holding symposiums to inform
citizens.” 9

Nancy Reagan believes that
there is hope for a “drug-free
tomorrow for our children, as
long as we keep working

. together." _

For information on “The
Chemical People” task forces,
contact Ricki Wertz or Ann
Gridley at 622-1491 or 622-1492.

Pitt News
. Endorsements

The editorial board of The Pitt News has heard past
student government boards express lofty campaign plat-
forms. But time has shown that the best laid plans of candi-
dates can die a quick death once the oath of office is
administered. We believe the ‘candidates who could best
serve the students are those armed with a clearly-deﬁned
approach to problems. We believe that ideas will be main-
tained only by those with an understanding ofthe inevitable
roadblocks which must be overcome.

Our endorsement criteria center on the candidates’ know-
ledge of both the organization —- and disorganization — of
the university. This naturally includes issues such as the
Office of Residence Life's alcohol policy, the status" of the
Internship Office and its reinstatement as a full-time facility
and the controversial remuneration process.

Finally, we looked for candidates who have a broad
understanding of the problems facing Pitt’s undergraduates,
a vision that extends beyond the traditional “lack of com-
munication” complaint.

In light of those criteria, we endorse Greg Petro for presi-
dent of the Student Government Board. '

Petro’s interests and understanding went beyond the oth-
ers', especially in his attention to the special needs of com-
muters — a group that has been systematically ignored for
too long. Petro articulated designs for a re-evaluation of the
alcohol policy and expressed some solid ideas on how to
improve the Placement Office and other university groups
that are intended for the benefit of students.

Among the board candidates,.we endorse Avery Abram’s,
again because of his realistic approach to the problems at
hand. He proposes to establish a joint committee between
RSA and SGB to re-evaluate the alcohol policy, extend
library hours during midterms and finals and begin negotia-
tions with Warner Cable Corp. in the hope of bringing cable
television to the residence halls.

Candidate Jeffrey Mallinger emphasized the problems
inherent in the remuneration process and said he would try
to reconstruct it so that less money will come from the
Student Activities Fee (i.e. the students’ pockets). Although
he feels that the current board has made many accomplish-
ments, they lost sight of their purpose and did not focus
enough attention on student problems.

Candidate David S. Pikovsky has had experience as an
RSA treasurer. He wants to take a serious look at the
allocations process and make it both easy and fair for all
student groups involved. He wants them to be considered as
individual and unique organizations in the allocations
process. .

Finally, candidate Betsy Fitzpatrick feels that her two
years of working on the work-study program have enhanced
her knowledge of student goverment board operations. One
of her goals is to clear out some of the red-tape within the
university structure especially where registration is
concerned.

' More important than the individual candidates is the
process of elections itself. We urge all students to turn their
complaints into a well-thought vote at the polls this week. If
the election or,the board is to extend beyond ceremony, the
students must take on some of the responsibility.

‘ H e
Y-

By J.P. MARRA

It’s been a scant two months and
II days now since I left Happy Val-
ley (Penn State), where students feed
the squirrels, for the streets of Oak-
land, where students feed the
pigeons. As a newcomer to the
urban university, I have been a bit
slow to pick up on the perks that Pitt
has to offer, such as Zelda’s Green-
house on a Friday night.

And so, it is with a bit of embar-
rassment that I admit that it took-me
two months and eight days to dis-
cover this mecca. Granted, the life of
a grad student gives one less oppor-
tunity to blow one’s self away very
often. Seldom did I let academics
interfere ‘with drinking beer when I
was a psych major. Put the kid’s
career on the line, however, and he
responds by treating beer as if it
tasted funny, smelled worse and
assured you a headache in the morn-

ing. In short, he avoids it, until a,

foamy finger tickles his nose one Fri-
day afternoon, puts its hand on his
shouler and says, in a seductive tone,
“hey, just a few tonight; wattaya say?
For old time’s sake.” So I decided to
put the books down for once and hit
Zelda’s. And, in the process, I found
out a few things that I thought might
be worth sharing.

Jhst  

The first might be obvious to a few
of you out there. You have to blow
off steam once in a while. The tired
old cliche about Jack and work and
no play applies all too well here.
Bars are theperfect place to do that,
and Zelda’s will certainly do. They
met and exceeded my minimum bar

 

standards: they _sell beer cheaply,
they sell as much of it as you care to
drink and they attract lots of pretty
girls that invariably get prettier as a
function of the total amount of beer
you drink. Then music blares, the
beers‘ begin to work their magical
effect and soon, it doesn’t matter
that they’re playing “Burning Down
the House” for the fifth time since
you arrived — that song, or any song
they choose to play, is your favorite
song in the whole wide world. It’s
great, isn't it? Never mind that you
have a presentation next Wednesday ‘
to prepare or that you have two mid-
terms next week, and you haven’t
cracked a book since tha last mid-
term. It’s Friday night, dammit, and
it’s time to have some fun.

A Few Tonight’

As‘ you must have suspected by
now, there is a flip side to all this.

Now, I don’t want to come across
like Mom, but there is this thing
called “moderation” that all of you
ought to be familiar with and prac-
tice occasionally. I spent three years
at a fraternity which purported to
cherish academic excellence above
all other collegiate pursuits. I saw
few good men washed down the
drainpsimply because they had their
priorities mixed up and believed that
closing the Skeller five nights a week
was more important than rising for
their first period class three morn-
ings a week. It’s not a pretty sight.
Ever see a friend pack his things up
in the middle of the term and leave?
It hurts. At some point, you have to
realize (if you have not done so
already) that the most efficient way
of accomplishing the goal that
brings you to the University of Pitts-
burgh is by making all actions which
lead to that goal a" priority in your
life. You’ll undoubtedly still. have
time left over to hit the bars. And
that is certainly important. I found
that out Friday night. Rediscovered
it, as it were.

Hope to see all of you having a
good ol’ time next wekend. At the

same time, though be careful out

there, okay?

Not Based On Principles

Dear Editor:

Who does Dana Reed think he’s
kidding?

Although some pertinent (and
disturbing) quotes from Israeli pub-
lications give credibility to his argu-
ment, he offers no alternative to
United States-Israeli policy in his
Oct. 26 Pitt News’ reply to Mr.
Zachary Grayson's pro-Israel article
from the previous issue.

Mr. Reed mentions a few relevant
facts that the Israeli government’s
inquiry into the massacre of Palesti-
nian refugees uncovered and that
Mr. Grayson omitted from his arti-
cle. Mr. Reed seems oblivious to the
meaning of the inquiry‘s existence: if
Israel is as villainous as he says,
there would have been no inquiry at
all, let alone the release of proof that

standard feature rather than an
option of any Marxist regime; its
roots lie in ideological opposition to
the most basic of all human rights —
the rights of the individual to own-
private property.

If the reader does not grasp this
point, -let him look at it this way:
robbery, censorship, rape and
murder are immoral because one's
home, valuables, ideas, body and life
are one’s private property. One can
favor legalized abortion and oppose
the draft for the same reason; the
people of a nation are not the prop-
erty of that nation’s government.
Karl Marx, however, deﬁned com-
munism as “the abolition of private
property,” but his modern-day fol-
lowers wear (and sell at a profit!)
T-shirts and buttons bearing the slo-
gan “Property is Theft,” and wher-

More important, even if I’m wrong
—— and if that is the case, I will be
nothing less than relieved — Mr.

' Reed fails to see that such repression

stems from a doctrine common to
the fascism he hates" and the commu-
nism he embraces: the doctrine that
the statehas the right to do anything
in order to protect its power over its
people, including imprisonment
without charges or trial, confisca-
tion of property with neither due
process of law nor compensation,
conscription, involuntary confine-
ment to a mental institution (with
deviation from the “party line” being
the only criterion for “insantiy”),
torture and even the murder of the
individual. Such events are inevita-
ble wherever there is disregard for
private property, capitalism and the
role of government as the protector

The Pitt News, Monday, October 31, I983

The horror film. What is it trying
to tell us? Is there more than just
meets the eye? More than luring the
audience to the climax of suspense,
only to have itjump in fear and expel
a scream that causes even the fear-
less to stir in their seat. That answer
may depend on you.

Donald Wollheim, in his book
“Terror in the Modern World," tells
us that horror, in the strict sense of
the word, relates to the actual belief
in the creatures of horror, rather
than the mere enjoyment of them
through books and films. This hor-

ror thrives on the unknown, on
darkness, loneliness, fear and ignor-
ance. _

However, many people do not
allow themselves to entertain this
realistic concept of horror for fear of
fear itself. But they "continue to
spend a large portion oftheir waking
hours, and maybe even some sleep-
ing ones, being terrified by the skill-
ful techniques of the horror film
director. I

. Pittsburgh has come to be recog-
nized as a city of horror. With the,
walking dead roaming the stores of
Monroeville (where the movie
“Dawn of the Dead” was made) and
vampires stalking the families of
Braddock (“.Martin"). George
Romero, a Pittsburgher and famous
horror film director, has taken the
Hollywood horror film and brought
it home. .

Romero, in his direction of “Mar-
tin" (I977) and “Dawn of the Dead”
(I979), has explored the viability of
the horror film genre. He has created

an international audience through __

Pittsburgh, and at the same time,
managed to keep much of_the natu-
ral setting as the underlying themes

. of his films.

,Marcia‘ Landy, a Pitt professor of
English/film studies, has spent
much of her time studying film and
directors of the horror genre. Along
with teaching such courses as The
Horror Film, Horror in Literature
and Science Fiction, Landy has pub-
lished articles in German, Canadian
and U.S. film magazines. --

“In many of his films, Romero has
expressed his interpretation of the
political and social themes of our
present day society,” Landy said. '

In “Martin,” for example,
Romero attempts to revamp the tra-
ditional vampire myths of garlic, the
cross to combat the vampire and the
sprouting fangs with which to bite
his victim. The film centers around
‘Martin's being led to believe that his
family has a history of vampirism

In the opening scene, Martin
selects a female victim while board-
ing a train bound for New York via
Pittsburgh. Before entering her
compartment, he prepares for the
killing, checkinghis equipment —- a
hypodermic needle and a razor
blade.

The’ moment before Martin
breaks into the compartment, he has
a fantasy about what will happen —
the woman, groomed and dressed in

a flowing nightgown, will welcome ‘

brings an unglamorous woman, who
has just flushed the toilet and
appears from the bathroomwearing
a beauty mask on her face. —

She struggles to defend herself
against Martin’s assault‘until the
drug he injects her with takesiover,
at which point, he undresses them

includes sucking the blood of his
partner.

“Night of the Living Dead" and
“Dawn ofthe Dead”are the first two
parts of a trilogy which Romero

4 plans to complete later with “Day of
‘ the Dead.” The films are centered

around the zombie and its‘function-
ing in relation to the other
characters.

In the films, it is the function of
the posse to restore the social order
that has been destroyed. Here, the
zombies represent supressed ten-
sions ‘and conflicts of the past and
present. _

Landy said that much more goes
into a horror film beyond the tech-

’ niques of making people frightened,
and this is why the film studies pro-

"creativity and the way audiences 

‘ that our conscious mind rejects, but

 

p’-

gram is part of the universit-y.’s-
curriculum. ‘ A
“The qiiestion of aesthetics an

cultural import are often raised in‘
the horror film,“ Landy said. “They
do every bit as much as literature 1‘
and the other arts do in regard to- ' 
respond to this creativity." _ . .-

Another area of subliminal ' 
themes represented in the5 horror
film includes what is repressed in our
culture today. Many times our
society exhibits the repression of 
children, sexuality, ethnic groups,
etc.

In his essay “An Introduction to’
the American Horror Film,” Robin
Wood, a noted film journalist, : V
reveals to us many of the complex ‘
aspects of the horror film from its A _
birth to the present. He contends 
that the notion of Hollywood
cinema as “it’s just entertainment" . -
goes "much deeper than most of u
are able to perceive. , ~ I,’

“The idea of entertainment, from
the directors‘viewpoint, is a medium
thrqugh which the conscious is lured
away from reality and placed in a’
spectrum of partial sleep; hence, 
allowingthe subconscious to sur-' ' '
face," Wood said. g ‘

, He said those who supportanega- _
tive attitude of this escapism tend to ,'
always view it»as “escape fro'rn”real- . _;
ity, when really it may be an “escape ‘-
to" horror. .’ 

Dreams are also escapes, Wood A _
said, and more often than not,«the I
horror film is the interpretation of A‘ *5‘
the -collective dreams of the film’s
makers and audiences. Film makers
see dreams as the embodiment of
repressed desires, tensions and fears '

,.
as the subconscious is tapped by
relaxation and sleep, these desires
are channelled out. I ,

Thus, the horror film may be . .

. . .To Horrible Horrors

continued from page ﬁve

Wood said we have an analogy
between the horror film and the
dream. The viewer, sitting in a dark
theater, is 'unaware that his con-
scious is slowly drifting away, only
to be replaced by the subconscious
with a fantasy-like experience.

On top of all the social and politi-
cal themes, however, the aura ofnat-
ural fright still exists. Usually people
go to the horror movie for the sheer
enjoyment of being scared to death.
Naturally, the degree to which view-
ers are frightened varies from person
to person; but they are still all there
for the same reason — to get scared.

Dana Polan, a Pitt professor in
English/film studies, has been
researching and viewing horror
movies with a critical eye for several
years and teaches a course called the

. History of American Film.

Polan said he sees the aspect of
being frightened as stemming from
intense drama and suspense.

“The things that scare me the most
in a horror film aren’t the scenes that
have peoplejump out at you, but the
ones that build horrifying anticipa-
tion and terrorizing suspense,”
Polan said. i

For example, in the recent movie
“The Dead Zone,” there is a scene
where a maniacal murderer is
known to be in one of the rooms ofa
certain house. The police and hero
go from room to room, not knowing
which room he is in or what to
expect when theyfind him.

“This is the type of horror that
scares me the most," Polan said.

He said the type of people who go
to the movies today are different

. from those of the ’30s and ’40s.

Now...

“Today, the audience is more spe-
cific,” Polan said. “The love stories
get the lovers and the horror fims get
the scary crowds.”

One sure thing, he said, is that
when a new horror movie is released,
the theater will be jam-packed with
people waiting to be “horrorfied.”

Although there are conﬂicting
stories about the ghosts of Cha-
tham College’s Benedum Hall,
there is little doubt that someone
— or something — haunts the
Shadyside mansion.

According to one version, a
descendant of the Benedum fam-
ily was a handsome officer who
fought in France in World War 1.
He was poisoned by mustard gas
in the trenches, which deformed
him. .

He returned to Pittsburgh and
died in his early 20s, and as
legend goes, he ha-unts the upper
floors of Benedum, appearing

after dark and chasing the coeds
around.

A more romantic version of
the haunting says that Claude
Benedum, sole heir to the family
fortune, fell in love with Maude,
a maid in the house. -

The Benedum family tried to

break up the romance and
encouraged Claude to go off to
war, but he died of pneumonia a
few weeks before he was sche-‘
.duled to leave for Europe. It is
said that the ghosts of Claude
and Maude still carry on their
romance in the corridors of the
dormitory.

.Automation Introduced

 emsi.  A

. C

I By COLETTE FERRIS

In the computer age, automation
.is surfacing everywhere, and the
Carnegie Library is no exception.

Carnegie Library has begun the

Iinstallation of Universal Library
’ System’s (ULISYS) model of the

Automated [Circulation System.
According to Carnegie Library
spokesperson, Olive Gallagher, the
switch to a computerized system is
for a more efficient public service.
Upon complete installation of the
automated circulation system which
is expected within the next three to
‘five months, the servicesyprovided
by the computer will speed up the
circulation process.

Gallagher said, “This system will I

help keep better track of_our book
collection. It will provide faster
overdues, therefore providing better
'- public service because the books will

 stay in constant circulation."

The automated circulation system

will work on the same basis as the O
' check-out system found in most

department stores. Each piece of

The Pitt News, Monday, October '31, I983

When material is being signed out, a
wand will be passed over the bar
code and the information from the
code will be stored on the computer.

Due to the growing number of
overdue books, this system will help
deter library patrons from keeping
overdue books out. In addition, it
will eliminate the manual typing of
the overdue notices.

Similarly, Carnegie-Mellon is in
the process of installing an Inte-
grated Library System (ILS), which
will perform all library functions.

According to the assistant direc-
tor for library automation, Mark
Kibbie, the system, which should be
completed in the spring, will handle
cataloging, circulation, acquisitions
and the generation of reports.

Director of the CMU library,

Journalist V
Gives Advice

continued from page one

Brody advised against taking
vitamin supplements. , ‘
“Eat food, not vitamin supple-
ments. Good nutrition does not
mean pumping your body full of
excess vitamins. Excess vitamins
and excess protein give Americans
the most expensive urine in the
world. Think of all the money.we
piss away!” ,
,Even if one is trying to lose
weight, one should allow oneself to

' ea.t non-nutritive - treats _,0‘CQaSl0_l__’l-

ally, Brody recommended.

“Allow yourself an occasional no-
no like a cookie or :1 few teaspoons
of ice"-cream. Don’t starve yourself
and then binge on a whole box of
cookies or a quart of ice cream."

Exercise allows one to eat more
and not gain weight, Brody
reminded her audience.

“The average overweight Ameri-
can does not eat more, she moves
less. Exercise is the best cure for
most health problems,” Brody said.

“God gave us legs for a reason, not
just to push pedals on an automo-
bile,” Brody said. I

Along with exercise, meditation
and fantasy” may also help reduce

anxiety caused by’ stress, Brody_

suggested.

“I use fantasy. For example, dur-
ing traffic jams, I really have to
reduce my stress. So I fantasize:
What would I do if the love of my
life, my college boyfriend who I
haven’t seen in years, suddenly

= pulled up next to me in traffic?”

Brody said.

In order to know when to extri-
cate yourself from stress overload
and. begin exercise, meditation or
fantasy, one should listen to one’s
body, Brody said.

“When you are on stress overload,
does your head ache? Your back
ache‘? Your stomach ache? Do you
start screaming all the time? Listen
and don't overload!” Brody urged.

Brody’s lecture was the third in a I

series of four in the “Focus:.Women
on Women” series. Paule Marshall,
novelist and short story writer, will

lecture next Thursday night at. 8‘

p.m. at Carlow College’s Kresge
Theatre. “Praisesong for the
Widow” is Marshall’s latest work.

Giangarlo denied that she had
attempted to overrrule any such
decision. Giangarlo said the primary
problem is the printers schedule.
She explained that "after Abrams
contacted her late Thursday with his
request, she checked into its feasibil-
ity with the printer who told her it
could not be done.

“I-fl were to overrule his [Brady’s]
decision, I would have done it then
[when Abrams introduced it] and
never have checked into it anyway,”
she said.

She explained that at first there
was some question about Abrams
coalition , but added that her job
was not to define what makes up a
slate. According to the code, a slate
is loosely defined as a student organ-
ization, but in this case, the coalition
is an informal student group.

At first, Brady said he questioned

whether Abrams could print the

name of the slate on the ballot. The
code says no more than four candi-
dates can appear with the name ofa
slate next to their names, but the
code also does not stipulate a min-
imum number of candidates. He

Pitt Hosts

Blood Drive

By LOUISE MARSHALL

Pitt and Penn State are not only
rivals in football but now also in
blood donation. The Central Blood
Bank of Pittsburgh, and the Ameri-
can Red Cross, Johnstown Region,
are sponsoring “The Great Pitt-
/Penn State Blood Challenge.”

All Pitt or Penn State supporters
can donate blood on Nov. 1 through
17, and among the first to already
donate blood for this campaign was
Chancellor Wesley Posvar. Pitt
football coach Foge Fazio and Penn
State football coach Joe Paterno are
honorary co-chairpersons for the
challenge.

I WTAE-TV is co-sponsoring the
event and willl cover the blood drive
tomorrow at 1:00 pm. ,

The donator will be able to specify
whether their blood donation is for
Pitt or Penn State, and all blood
donations will benefit patients in the
Pittsburgh area. Governor Richard
Thornburgh has been invited to
present an award to the winnning
university during a ceremony at the
Pitt/Penn State football game on
Nov. 19.

Pitt’s fraternities and sororities
are hosting the blood drive on Nov.
'1, 3 and 17.

“Not only will donators be able to
designate their favorite team, but
also their favorite fraternity or sor-
ority,” according to Cheryl Perpe-
tua, overall Greek Week
chairperson. '

“The University of Pittsburgh is
the largest donator of blood in the
Pittsburgh area. Pitt’s fraternities
and sororities donated 46 percent of
the University’s blood supply,” said
Ed Polovina, overall Greek
Chairperson.

“Our goal is to increase that per-
centage,” Perpetua said.

Polovina said that Pitt’s fraterni-
ties and sororities will play a major
part in this aspect of the Pitt/Penn
State Challenge this year. I

Blood Drive centers will be open
at various places on the Pitt campus
as well as in local hospitals and Cen-
tral Blood Bank locations. Accord-
ing to Perpetua, this year, there is
more incentive to donate blood with
this type of challenge, not only for
Pitt’s fraternities and sororities, but
also for communtity involvement.
Interested persons should call 456-
1857 for more information.

sea Ballot Reprint Requested

said he later called Giangarlo to see
what her decision would be and
would abide by her decision if she
decided to reprint the ballots — if
they were notalready printed.
‘Abrams emphasized the impor-
tance of this issue as it relates to the
separation of powers between the
administration and the board.
“They gave me an incorrect elec-
tion code, and it was their error,” he
said. “It is a matter of principle. Jim
[Brady] told me repeatedly that he
would correct it [reprint the ballots]
and Jgyce [Giangarlo] has refused.”

These matters and the question of
who authorized the reprinting of the
ballots have not been resolved.
Brady will considerthe recommen-
datio_n at today's meeting. It is, how-
ever, possible that elections could be
postponed for a few days if the bal-
lots cannot be reprinted. The cost
will be approximately $300, accord-
ing to Brady. If the board does not
decide in Abrams‘ favor, he has said
he will seek to invalidate the election
and the cost of a new election could
be a much as $1,300, according to
Bra_d_y.

By CHRlSTlNA CLINTON

This year’s race ' for Student
Government Board (SGB) president
pits four diverse candidates against
one another in yet another election
where there are no clear—cut issues.

Two of the four candidates came
down hard on the current board for
its inactivity this year, and the only
major issue of ‘discussion was the
Office of Residence Life’s alcohol
policy that was implemented in
September. '

Only one of the four has previous
experience with SGB, and three out
of the four are fraternity members.
All four are juniors.

Waleed Al-Atraqchi, a major in
biology and psychology, is a
member of the Pre-professional

' Society and" a transfer student from

Pitt at Johnstown. Greg Petro is a
member of Phi Gamma Delta frater-
nity and majoring in biology and
business. He is the vice-president of
the Commuter Association, a
member of the campus judicial
board andrthe Student Publications
and Media’ Board and a house man-
ager of the William Pitt Union.

Lon Santis, a mining engineering
major, has been actively involved in
his fraternity, Delta Tau Delta. He
has been charity coordinator, assist-
ant treasurer and alumni relations
coordinator. He was also a ﬂoor
representative for the Resident Stu-
dent Association (RSA).

Ken Strarn, a 1983 board
member, is majoring in political
science and German and is a
member of Theta Chi fraternity. He
has also been involved in the Hand-
in-Hand Festival and was a tutor in
the Learning Skills Center. ,

Al-Atraqchi and Petro blasted the
performances of both the current

“It seems to me that the only peo-

you never hear from them again.
They don’t have the best interest of
in mind.” Al-Atraqchi
stressed that he did not mean his
fellow candidates were like that.

Petro said the current board has a
problem with prioritization, mean-
ing it does things that he would not
consider important. A He said the
most important thing the board had
to deal with all vear was whether or
not U.S. presidential candidate
Gary Hart would speakat Pitt.

“Now, on their last leg, they’re
talking about the Internship Office
when it should have been talked
about all year,” Petro said. “Student
Government should establish a sys-

tem so that long-range goals don‘t

end with their board.”

 Santis said the current board is
doing “a pretty good job,” but there
is a lack of communication between
SGB and other student groups. He

understand the allocations process.

“There should be some sort of
programset up where the Alloca-
tions Committee and groups can get
together to discuss how the alloca-
tions process works,” Santis said.

Stram said the major problem
that exists with the current board is
in the area of public relations. He
also cited the board's lack of knowl-
edge of the SGB constitution as ‘a
weakness. He said the board only
found out this term that there is sup-
posed to be a student assembly and
regular meetings of the board and
the standing committees, something
that hasn't been done.

“We should advertise open meet-
ings and let students know Lhaﬂhey

what student government does,"
Strarn said. “We have to improve the
overall view that students have of
student government, as if we are a
distant and useless group.”

Al-Atraqchi, Petro and Stram all

intended to do. A

“Hard alcohol is all that people

He said if he is elected, he will try
to get the board involved in trying to
relax the rules where 21-year-olds
are concerned.

Petro said there is virtually no

way that the administration can .

enforce the policy because it's based
on an honor system.

“I think for students over 21 it's
unfair,” he said. “They're 21 and
should be responsiblefor how much
they drink."

Petro added that there needs to be
a re-evaluation of the system as it is

-now and students that are 21 and
over should be allowed to bring in
more alcohol — up to two cases of
beer, for example — in a week’s
time. . ,

there is nothing students can do
about it now.

“If you want to drink, you'll
drink, and you can get around it,"
Stram said. “Parties now are
quieter, there's not a lot of vandal-
ism or people throwing things out of
the windows."

Santis was the only candidate that
had no real opinion on the issue,
saying it is “a very touchy subject.”

“I‘m very concerned about pro-
tecting the rights of 21-year-olds,"
he said. “I really don't think it's fair

~ Roland _l-_l9wze

Roland Howze said that he
sees the Student Government
Board as the voice for the student
population and as the only way
students will be heard.

Rising tuition is a concern for
Howze, but he realizes that an
individual does not have much of
an impact on major decisions.
For this reason, he would like to

“concentrate his efforts on work-

ing with the board as a group
that will vocalize and try to
change actions that will have an

‘ V effect on students.

Howze thinks the new alcohol
policy is a fair one because it
complies with the law that pro-
hibits minors from drinking.

He sees the current board as
segmentized, with a majority,
rather than a minority rule. He
would like to broaden the scope
of the board by involving minori-
ties and getting feedback directly
from a minority board member
rather than simply “asking
around.” '

Broadening the scope of com-

munications is one of Howze‘s‘

goals as a board member, and he
would like to see more programs
implemented to aid the students.
This extends to the commuters,
who make up approximately 87

percent «of the student popula- 4

tion. He would like to see pro-
grams designed specifically to
appeal to the commuter and keep
the commuter on campus after
classes.

Howze is a junior majoring in
math. He is an active member of
the Black Action Society; Phi
Groove, a'service organization;
and the gospel choir at Pitt.

Pamela Hart served for one
year on the student relations
committee of student govern-
ment, but she doesn't think the
group is solving the problem of
student apathy. She thinks the
board should take a “new

P_amela Hart
approach" to the students it
represents.

She believes that the increases
in tuition should more closely
reflect the inflationary costs
affecting the university. She said
that recent tuition hikes were not
justified in light of those costs.

Hart said that the limitations
of the alcohol policy are not rea-
sonable and that it onl encour-
ages people to sneak a cohol in.

She also said that even with

the opening of the renovated stu- .

bdentunion;-the need's'of'co'mmu-

 
 

I fftzp OfO

..._.-

ters are not being met. She said
the union is more of a “show-
case” and that people are not
made to feel comfortable in it.
“If you are going to have a

 place to dance, then make it a
, place to dance," Hart said. “We
‘ shouldn't have to worry about
 messing things up.”

She wants to see the recogni-
tion policy returned to student
government, where it belongs.

Hart said that the one-year
term of the board doesn‘t allow
much time for real changes to be
brought about.

“Change is a strong word,"
Hart said. “There is not that

 much time for change. I would
A like to see a lot of things

adjusted.”

‘ Among ‘those adjustments
would be the formation of a
scholarship fund for which local
businesses would provide dona-
tions. She said that students and
other university personnel pro-
vide the Oakland business com-
munity with its livelihoods and
that something should be “put
‘back into" the school.

She would like to see test prep-
aration programs for medical
students brought to campus sim-
ilar to the _LSAT prep course
offered thisiterm.

Hart, an English writing
major from Center Township, is
a member of Phi Beta Sigma sor-
ority and active in the Army
ROTC.

Keith R. Jefferson

Board candidate Keith R. Jef-
ferson is concerned that the cur-
rent board is not touching on the
inadequacies of the university.

He sees the limited computer I

facilities, the lack of public
knowledge of board events and
the lack of black-affiliated servi-
ces as major issues in his
campaign.

Jefferson sees the installation
of more computer terminals and
even the possibility of putting
computers in the dormitories as a
possible solution to the current

I computer shortage.

The prices of materials at the
university bookstore is another
concern for Jefferson. He said
that he would like a bookstore to

' open in Oakland to create com-

petition and hopefully keep pri-

cesdown. ' .

Jefferson does not agree with
the current alcohol pol-icies. He
said that the policy increases the
amount of students who sneak
alcohol into the dormitory. He
also said that he didn’t think
alcohol created a big problem in
the past.

Another issue that Jefferson
would like to address is parking
for commuters. As it is now,

 _  there is limited parking for com-
Houston photo

muting students, and the cost of
using these facilities adds up. Jef-
ferson would like more parking
spaces to be available to students
who drive to school.

Handouts and posters circu-
lated around campus is another
idea Jefferson has to increase the
public‘s knowledge of Student
Government Board activities. I

Jefferson is a computer science
major and is the vice-president of
Phi Groove, a service organiza-
tion. He is also involved in Men
Interested In Delta, which is
affiliated with Delta Sigma
"l‘heta~'sorority:. - « 

  And There Were Ten...The

Jeff Mallinger, a senior major-
ing in , economics and political
science, said that he feels the cur-
rent board has “lost sight of their
purpose” and is not focusing

_.;. 

Jeffrey llllalllnger

attention on student problems.
He sees the remuneration pro-

. cess, the limited library hours,

the adequacy of the student
health center and the‘ feasibility
of installing walk/don't‘ walk
‘lights on Forbes Avenue and
Bigelow Boulevard as the basis
of the platform for his campaign.

Mallinger would like to put an
end to what he considers waste-
ful and excessive spending where
the student activities fee is con-
cerned. He would like to re-
evaluate the remuneration
process and find alternative

sources to fund payments to -

students.

He sees the alcohol policy
implemented in the dormitories
this year as a two-sided issue. He
said that it will help protect the
university from liability, but he
also feels that it limits the rights
of students who are 21 years of
age and legally allowed to drink.
He also questions/the legality of
students’ having bags searched at
the desk and said that he thinks
that the old policy’ should have
been more strongly enforced
rather than changed.

The adopt-a-commuter pro-
gram is one that Mallinger would
like to see stressed to help the
commuters become more
involved in campus activities. He
would like to see more money
allocated to make this project
successful.

Mallinger said that unless.

there is another 1960, students
are not going to be as politically
involved, and would like to
advertise to get students
involved. He alsowould like to
see the teacher-student forums,
which were proposed last year,
get off the ground, as they too
would help increase student
awareness. .

Mallinger is a member of Pi
Lambda Phi fraternity, serves on
the university judicial board and
is a mentor.

Betsy Fitzpatrick thinks that

the size of the university is one of I

the biggest obstacles that the stu-
dent government board faces. ‘

“The board seems to want to
function for the student but often
has trouble doing that because of
the size," Fitzpatrick said. “It's a
big university, but that problem
can be overcome...it‘s been done
at other universities." .

She believes one of thebest
ways to reach such a large uni-

versity population is through the

university media."

The problem of registration,
particularly for. computer science
classes, is one of the biggest
problems facing students accord-
ing to Fitpatrick.

She would also like to see the
board continue its battle _to
regain a full-time internship
office.

“Internships are the liaison
between the students and their
futures,” Fitzpatrick said. ‘‘It’s a
necessity, and it should be able to
represent all the students and all
the different fields of study."

She believes that the alcohol
policy has good points on both
sides but that ultimately, the pol-
icy is unfair and not an approp-
riate action for the problem. She
said that the question of who
really has the power to do some-
thing about it has to be answered
first.

Fitzpatrick believes that the
reformation of the student
assembly ‘might go 'a‘ long way in

i.
improving communication
between student groups.

She said that the apathy that
Pitt suffers from is due in large
part to the lack of interaction
between commuters and resident
students. She said that the effort
to reorganize the commuter

_ association was “terrific” and

one that should eventually
improve the conditions unique to
commuting students.

“I think you’re cutting yourself
short if you just drive in to class
and drive home at night and not
get anything out of it but your
notes,” Fitzpatrick said. “Pitt
has so. much to offer that is
exciting.”

She is a junior majoring in
business and English writing.
Her past experience includes two
years of work-study in the SGB
office, during which she became
familiar with the operations of
the board. She has served as pub-
lic relations chairperson for the

Hand-In-Hand Festival and‘

RSA vice president for Holland
Hall. ' .. _

Candidate David ‘Pikovsky

feels that his experience as treas-
urer for the Resident Student
Association makes him qualified
to re-evaluate the ‘allocations
procedure.

Pikovsky said that he would
like each student organization to
be considered as individual and
unique groups when evaluating
the need for student funding.

He also said that the conti_nua-
tion of the Internship Office is
important for students, and he
would like to work to get it oper-
atmg on a full-time basis. He
would like to continue to petition
the administration and to inves-
tigate why there are not enough
resources to make it a full-time

that can be used as an
alternative.

Pikovsky also sees the over-
ﬂow in the RJE centers and the
limited library hours as concerns
for his platform. He would like
to see both the computer centers
and the libraries open longer to
accommodate the students.

Although he thinks the alco-
hol policy is a fair one, Pikovsky
added that it is unrealistic
because it is difficult to enforce.
He saidthat he would like more
student involvement on impor-
tant issues that eventually result
in new policies,» but this must
start from the top. He said that
the administration must realize
the student concern before they
can have input.
~ Rebuilding the Commuter
Affairs Committee and getting
the committee recognized by the
Office of Student Activities is
another of Pikovsky’s goals. He
said that the committee is an
important one because so many
of Pitt’s students commute and it
can be an effective aid to the
problems of commuters.

Pikovsky would also like to
see a newsletter sent to the heads
of the various campus organiza-
tions or a bi-monthly meeting
organized to help diminish the
lack of communication between
the students, administration and
Student Government Board. '

Candidate Robert Kramer
said that he believes student
involvement is very important to
the university. A member of Phi

‘Gamma Delta fraternity, Kra-

mer is a mentor, a member of the
Pitt Lacrosse team and has
served as an Interfraternity
representative for his fraternity.

   

Robert Kramer.

He also serves on the University
Affairs Senate and the Natural
Science Implementation Com-
mittee.

Kramer is concerned about the
tuitionringreases ‘and would‘ like

 

i become more personal

\

to investigate what alternative
funding is available so that
needed money can come from
outside resources instead of from
the student.

Although he said that the idea
behind the alcohol policy is
good, Kramer said the policy is
not working. He said that he
would like to go out and get the
opinions of students before
important policy decisions like
this are made so that there is stu-
dent input and as a result, both
the students and the university
administrators are satisfied.

Kramer also said that he
would like to re-evaluate the
adopt-a-commuter program that
was started‘ last year because
although it is a good idea, it was
not practical. He would like to
see the program revamped and

"implemented to help give com-

muters the opportunity to
become more involved in the
university.

Kramer citedthe lack of stu—_
dent interest as a problem for the
current board, and blamed this
apathy on the fact that students
are not aware of the board’s
activities. He also said that the
board did not utilize the work of
the standing committees.

For example, last year, when
the board held interviews for the
standing committees, not
enough interested students app-
lied and board members were
filled the positions themselves.

Kramer would like to see the
Student Government Board
with
regard to the students by making
them aware of board proceed-
ings and informing them on
important issues.

Jim Haug would like to see

the students. He said that most
students are not aware of who is
on the board or when it meets.

__Haug, a sophomore political
science/economics major from
Lafayette, Indiana, said that the
new alcohol policy, “obviously is
not being enforced.” '

“Whatever the policy is, that
lack of enforcement renders it
totally meaningless,” Haug said;
“It’s semantic quibling whether
you can bring in 12 cans, twice a
week, or a keg.”

Haug said that students
should have been better.
informed of the changes and that
an organized response should be
made by either SGB or RSA or
an ad hoc group.

.He thinks that costs are the
biggest problem facing the
undergraduates at Pitt.

“I don't see any major return
of services for the increases in
costs,” Haug said. “The adminis.
tration just seems to be totally
out of-.toii<;h;.with-the students.‘.' '

Haug is currently trying to
regain a scholarship that was lost
through a clerical errror, and he
said that he “is being fought at
every turn by the administra-
tion.”

He thinks that the SGB is the
most practical solution to the
student-adminstration commun-
ication gap. He believes that
increased student involvement in
the organizations that exist is the
first step to" solving the problems.

“Bureaucrats, like there exist
in the university, are impressed
by, organizations and titles,"
Haug said.‘-“When an institution
speaks for the student, with the
weight of others behind them,
that makes a difference."

Haug said that the recognition
policy “belongs in the hands of
the SGB.”

Haug is a member of the Pi
Kappa Alpha fraternity as well
as the Pitt Debate team. He has
served on various committees
within his fraternity and recently
was associate rush chairman.

John Geyer‘ ,

John Geyer follows in the tra-
dition of his fraternity, Delta

Tau Delta, in his pursuit of a seat
on student government. He said

‘that just knowing Delts who

have served on the board, includ-
ing past presidents Bill Abraham
and Todd DeLuca and the cur-
rent president, Mark Downs, has
helped him understand how the
board works and what it takes to
get things accomplished. ’
Geyer, a junior English wri-
ting/ political science major, ‘
would like to see the Resident
Student Association (RSA)
increase its activities, then it
would be able to petition the
Allocations Committee for a
bigger part of the student activi-
ties fee money-“Geyer added that
because the Greek system is not

. as strong here as at other schools,
' many students have few social

options. He believes this prob-
lem should be given more atten-
tion by RSA.

He believes that the alcohol
policy is fair for those students
under-21 years old living in the
dorms ‘because the law says they
should not be drinking, but he
added that the rights of those of
legal drinking age should be bet-
ter protected.

“I really don't think the policy
is working,” Geyer said.

Geyer, who commuted from
the Baldwin section of Pitts-
burgh for two terms, said that
commuters have to better organ-
ize in order to get their concerns
addressed‘. He wants to look into
somehow getting a portion of the
meter money collected by the city
put back into the university,
primarily the commuter
association.

mately, “the administration does
what it wants.” He believes forc-
ing ideas upon the administra-
tion is not the way to approach
change.

Avery Abrams

The Office of Resident Life
(ORL)‘s new guidelines for alco-
hol use in the dormitoriesis “a
ridiculous policy," according to
Avery Abrams.

‘“I don’t see how this is solving
the [alcohol] problem," Abrams
said. “This is just clearing up the
symptoms as far as they [the
administration] can see.”

He said that the Resident Stu-
dent Association has been slow
to act on the policy changes and

. that he would like to form a joint

RSA/SGB committee to look

into this and other problems.
Abrams also disagrees with’

the new recognition policy for

  
   

 

C» student groups which gives. the ’

decision-making power over to
the Office of Student Activities.
“It’s taking all of the credibil-_
ity away from Student Govern- ‘
merit Board,” Abrams said. “It's,
also taking away all the respon-
siveness to the students who put
them there.” .-

Abrams wants to begin negoti-
ations with Warner Cable Corp.
and the university to bring cable
hook-ups to the dormitories.

He would also like to see the
price of season‘ football tickets
included in the student activities ,
fee, just as tickets for basketball
games are now.

Abrams outlined several elec-
tion reforms for student govern-
ment, including plans to give g
commuters better, representa- ;
tion. He thinks that future elec-
tions should require voting for a
president, board members and a
commuter board member, there-
by assuring at least one represen-
tative on every board.

He also would like to «see the
term of office changed so that it‘
would begin and end in April,
thus allowing seniors to partici-
pate. He added that a minimum
of one-year experience on a
standing committee of student
government should be required
of candidates. '

Abrams is a sophomore,
majoring in political science and
speech. He served last year as the
treasurer of the student govern-
ment’s . Governmental Relations.
Committee and has been active
in RSA and WPGH. He is cur-
rently the university coordinator
for the Alan Cranston for Presi-
dent organization.

continued from page eleven.

He also said there is nothing to do
at Pitt, outside of Pitt Program
Council movies and video games.
Dorm ‘students cannot have parties,

’ the under-21 crowd cannot go to

bars, and some students do not want
to join fraternities or sororities, he
said, leaving very little for the stu-
dents to do. He said such things as
have a school formal or three big
events per term would give the stu-
dents something to which to look
forward.

Petro said one of the major prob-
lems with students is how they are

C dealt with by student organization.

"He said student groups are set up but
do not benefit the students
themselves.

To alleviate this problem, he said --

groups such as RSA and the Com-
muter Association should receive
more social funding because that is
what they were primarilydeveloped
for. Those two groups, he said, cover
virtually every student on Pitt’s
campus.

Santis said the problem he sees
facing undergraduates is a lack of
school spirit when Pitt is compared
to other schools.

“We should implement program
where balloons or ﬂashcards are
given out at football games," he said.
“It [school spirit] will trickle down
to campus to some extent.”

Strain cited apathy as a major
problem and said the board can help
eliminate it by instilling enthusiasm
in the freshmen. The board should
get involved with the freshmen dur-

ing orientation and write follow-up .

letters during the term.
He also said the library should

V alter its hours to better accomodate

“late-night studiers.” Finally, he said
the board should look into the rea-
sons why computer majors at Pitt
have to camp-out the night before
registration in order to get into com-
puter classes. With the new compu-
ter _agreement between Pitt and
Digital Equipment Corporation, he
said, advisers should be able to have
computers installed intheir offices
so they can tell with the touch of a
button which classes are open and
which are not. '

When asked what they realisti-
cally thought they could accomplish
if they were elected, all four candi-
dates had—lists of what could get

d°n¢,..in-t1ie.ir.« lzrmsnih i.."?’.'-.‘l’.°:-.r.‘v.«.

Al-Atraqchi said if he were
elected, he would get ORL to re-
evaluate both the visitation and the
alcohol policies. He also said the
board should keep the student

health center open on the weekends, -. _

keep more cafeteriasopen on Sun-
days and sponsor activities such as
dances that would be open to all‘
students. . ,

’ Petro said the board could reopen
the Internship Office on a full-time

basis in the William Pitt Union.‘
‘ instead of part-time in the Cathedral

of Learning. He also said he could
realistically shorten the amount "of
time it takes for the allocations pro-
cess and increase the social funding
for RSA and the Commuter Associ-
ation. ‘ - .

“It shouldn’t take half of 12
months for those three," he said. “I
don’t think we should decide if a
board should be put up there or
chairs go there; -it's a ,waste of the
administration‘s, the students’ and
my time."

Santis said he would strive to
improve the communication lines

‘between student government and?
other student groups. He also said ~

that the Internship Office could be
reopened full-time under his tenure.
Finally, he said that instead of

having the mandatory teaching eval- ,

nation that has been talked about
for years, SGB, working with the

administration, should set up more _

programs like the Chancellor’s
Award for Distinguished Teaching-.
That way, he said, teachers would be
put on the offense instead of the
defense and try to be better in the
classroom.

Strain also said he felt he could get

’ the Internship Office working on a ‘

full-time basis once again. He said
this office is vital to students
because, in addition to classroom

work, students need practical infor--

mation before entering the job
market.

The student assembly could also
be formed since the current board

has a list of bylaws and objectives, he V

said. Longer library hours could
also be maintained, he said, if stu-

dents demand that they are needed. '

He said he wants to see a continua-

‘ tion of the LSAT classes.

Finally, all four candidates agreed
on one question posed to themnthe

real power that SGB wields in the 1
university. All four said that SGB= 
would have some power if Pitt st_u- »

trading a touchdown, penalties, lost-
yardage plays and stalled series with
the opposition.

But the kicking game, well, it
almost lost a nerve-wrenching free-
for-all played out between the
Panthers and Syracuse before
52,374 fans at Pitt Stadium on
Saturday.

Pitt picked up its fourth consecu-

. tive victory, fortified its record to 6-2

and made what seemed like five
hours in the game’s ﬁnal five min-
utes taste like sugar once a third-
string walk-on sealed Pitt’s l3-l0
squeaker over Syracuse"(3-5).

Little did anyone realize that
when placekicker ‘Eric Schubert
slipped and “took his knee out” after
Pitt’s only TD drive of the day in the
second quarter, his loss (expected to
be three weeks) would have meant a
lousy tie. ,

That’s what it narrowly came
down to when walk-_._(,_>n__Pat Vian-
court was shoved int6‘:tlteflimeli’ght
with seven strikes remaining on the‘
clock and a 43-yard field goal
attempt waiting to either lift him to
notoriety or plunge him to the
depths of goat status. ~ _ .. V _

v The blond-haired freshman’ from
Cleveland not only made good from
the left hashmark but had to endure
an avanlanche of nearly 100 other
players who swamped him.

Down went the south end
uprights. _ ' ,

“When you have all your team-
mates around” you, it gives you a lot
of assurance,” Viancourt said.
“When everyone believes in you and
gives you words of encouragement,
it helps you to know you have some
100 teammates pulling for you.”

“You know, that saying ‘Count
On Me In 83’ meant a lot today,”
Fazio said afterward. “We used
many players today who filled the
role of being counted on when the
opportunity came.”

“Here’s a guy who is a walk-on
and kicks it when we really need it,”
tailback Joe McCall said. “That’s
what makes our team so great.”

Obviously Viancourt made the
biggest impression. After Snuffy
Everett, Schubert’s initial replace-
ment, missed two second-half field
goals (both within the 30-yard chalk
mark), Fazio had seen all he had to
and gave Viancourt the confident
nod. ‘

_“It was tough for‘Snuffy to miss
them, but that's the way it goes,”
Fazio said.

For Viancourt’s part, he stood
purposefully, almost solemnly,
before the tee, performing a custom-
ary sign of the cross before a delir-
ious stand-up throng of, people.

“You have to be nervous,” he said
in his soft-spoken style. “As much as
you block out the nervousness,
there’s always‘ a certain amount of
fear involved.”

Ironically, a 17-point favorite Pitt
squad inﬂicted anything but the sort
into the underdog Orangemen. Both
teams remained deadlocked l0-10
once Syracuse quarterback Greg
Christodulu hit wide out Mike
Siano with a'22.-yard scoring strike
two and a half minutes before
halftime.

A Most  
Unlikely
Savior

By CHARLIE O'HARA «

Sophomore split end Brian Davis ‘ .3

was standing on the sideline in the
second quarter of the Pitt-Syracuse
game when he found out that he had .
just kicked off for the Panthers.
Davis, who wears the number “2”.
on his back, didn't quite understand

what was happening. Those in the -’

crowd similarly didn’t,know any
better.

In fact, freshman walk-on kicker
Pat Viancourt and his father were
probably the only ones who recog-
nized the error. -

Game day programs, team rosters I
and depth charts do not even=list
Viancourt. ,

But by the time the game had

ended, there wasn’tabody in attend- - P _
I ance unfamiliar with the former
nose tackle from Holy Name High , _

School, which is located just outside’ ;
of Cleveland. _
With seven precious ticks remain-

\ing in regulation time and the score

knotted at 10 apiece, Viancourt
booted the Panthers toa l3-10 vic-
tory with a heroic 43-yard effort. \
After the kick sailed through the _
uprights, Viancourt was bombarded 3'
by his teammates. ,
“I was on the bottom of a pile of
about 2,000 guys,” Viancourt said.

“Without a doubt, it was the greatest 

thrill of-my career." . . , .
In the second quarter, ‘
placekicker Eric Schubert had?
tripped while attempting a kickoff.
In so doing, he popped his knee .out._f
He was done for the day and possi-V
bly the season. _ . _ 
Pitt head_coach Foge Fazio and 
backfield assistant Andy Urbanic
then decided to go with another jun- .
ior, Snuffy Everett, who responded-'
with a 45-yard field goal that gave .
Pitt a 10-3 lead.’ -
It was as if Schubert never left.
But the air in Snuffy’s baloon was.
soon to be released. In the second
half, he failed miserably on two rela-

.--tively simple attempts of 25 and 29 '

yards. "

Another decision had to be made.

The switch to Viancourt proved to_
be the right one.

“We knew [Viancourt] had a good
leg," Fazio said. “We didn't think it
would be fair to ask [Everett] again.

“The [team's motto], ‘Count on
me in 83’ meant a lot today." _

Pitt quarterback John Congemi,
who holds for field goals and extra
points, also had to come through in
the clutch. .

‘‘I’m not used to holding for left-
footed kickers,” Congemi said. “I
don’t even remember the play, it all -
happenedgso fast. .

Despite 2 Losses, Spikers Finish 2nd

By LAURIE KUBLI

Pitt's women’s volleyball team
found its way back to conﬁdence
avenue this weekend at the Tennes-
see Classic, after experiencing diffi-
culty keeping its feet on that elusive
path in the past several weeks.

The spikers have displayed a
marked lack of the consistency and
confidence that were trademarks of
their play through five tournament
victories, the last one being a meet-
ing of Big East Conference teams at
Seton Hall.

Since then, the team has finished
fourth at the Purdue Classic and
third at its own invitational. There-
fore, the tournament at Tennessee

was to be an important test of the
squad’s ability to return to winning
form.

With the Big East championships
only three weeks away, the weekend
offered the Lady Panthers an oppor-
tunity to begin their charge for the
conference battles.

_ According to Coach Shelton Col-
her, the team is over its mid-season
slump and is preparing for that
charge.

“The most important thing for a
team to do is to peak at the right
time,” Collier commented. “We’re
over our mid-season slump, and step
by step we’re preparing to peak. We
hope to be emotionally and strategi-
cally ready to peak by the NCAAS.”

That statement is substantiated by
Pitt's handling of North Carolina
and Lamar in between two tough
losses to Texas and Tennessee.

The team from up North first took
on the Lady Longhorns, a program

‘from a part of the country where

women’s volleyball is taken very
seriously, according to Collier. Pitt
took to its task with fervor, but came
up shy of a match victory, losing to
the Lady Longhorns, 14-16, 15-9, 8-
15 and 14-16.

Collier asserts that the strongest
part of his team’s game plan was
inefficient against Texas.

He explained, “Basically, we are
an inexperienced, average team that
can challenge any team in the coun-

try because of out potentially excel-
lent serving, but right now we are
inconsistent.”

Defending Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence champion North Carolina was
pummeled by Ulana Kohutiak’s 18
kill spikes as Pitt, spurred on by the
presence of several area players
across the net, feathered the Tar
Heels, 15-12, 15-6, 15-3. Kohutiak
pounded 72 spikes onto opponents’
courts this weekend.

Carmen Tapia hit 51 spike kills,
second for Pitt.

“Carmen had'one of her best perfor-
mances since coming to Pitt. She
was a dominant blocker at the tour-
nament, against many top spikers,”
Collier remarked.

The demanding, defense-oriented
practices Collier has been putting his
team through paid off, particularly
in Pitt’s match against Lamar. The
Panthers arose from the melee to top
the Texas-based team, 6-15, 15-3,
15-13, 7-15,15-12.

“It was a verygood win for us,"
Collier remarked. “We are finding
that we have the capabilities to win
at the national level.” The Pitt coach
believes that the close matches were
beneficial to his team, who had to
respond to the pressure of playing
highly respected teams.

The tournament finale pitted the
Panthers against 17th-ranked Ten-
nessee. Pitt is the only team to have

continued from page ﬁfteen
Pitt started its first drive of the

.q',half with good field position at its

own 48 but was forced to settle for a
three-point attempt when an illegal
receiver was spotted, giving the
Panthers fourth-and-l0 from Syra-
cuse’s l2.

Everett’s attempt died several feet
short of the crossbar.

After their next drive started off
with- a 10-yard holding call and

~ ‘ended with a punt, the Panthers

reeled off 14 plays on their following
series, were hit with a five-yard ille-
gal -procedure and again went into
field goal formation.

Q,-r This time, Everett's attempt had

the distance but was wide of the left
upright. ‘
Meanwhile, Pitt’s defense played
to the perfection of tradition. Syra-
cuse never stepped into Pitt territory
for the entire half except when the
Orangemen went for a punt on
fourth-and-two from Pitt's 47.
Defensive end ‘A1 Wenglikowski
started the half off in fitting fashion,

gesacking Christodulu (seven of i9 for
" 129 yards overall) for a 13-yard loss.

Syracuse’s next drive concluded
when tackle Bill Maas stepped over
anything in his way and smothered
Todd Norley —— in for several downs
after Christodulu bruised his left hip
on an earlier-executed option.
Both linemen later notched
another sack, giving the offense the
ball for a final shot at somehow
adding to its 10-point output. With

affhe two failed field goals behind it,
re. the John Congemi-led brigade had
trouble sustaining another scoring

chance;-:1‘   ’ r ' .. -..
Onedrive soured when Congemi
was sacked for a seven-yard loss.
H'?Aiiother traveled all of 1.2 yards after
starting from Pitt’s. 15. And yet

_ another, from Syracuse's 19, went

down the tubes when a potential TD

pass to tailback Chuck Scales was

‘intercepted.
, ' .‘A‘I wasn’t surprised that Syracuse
played as tough as they did," said

3 Congemi, who emerged passing for

194 yards on 20 of 39 attempts."

_ “I didn’t think it would be this
close, and it wasn't as close as the
scoreboard indicated because we
had so many opportunities to

score.” ~ ' ‘

The final one emerged when line-
backer Troy Benson intercepted a
Christodulu misﬁring at the Syra-
cuse 46 and headed for the sidelines
to drown the clock’s progress.

“[Christodulu] just sort of rolled
out,” Benson said. “I dropped into
my zone and Maas was puttinglpres-

' /sure on him. He didn’t see his

receiver, I caught the ball and said ‘I
better get out of bounds.’ ” «
That set up Yiancourt’s heroic
effort and ended two I fruitless
quarters. V
, “Another guy on defense gave up,
but we said ‘nothing doing’ and we
didn’t," Benson said. “The intercep-
tion didn't mean anything, but with
the field goal, it made me happier.
“I was just happy to see Pat make
it.”

 Another who passed on similar

accolades was Congemi, the o. 3

who held center Tony ,Magnelli’s -

snap during the momentous
occasion.

“I .was feeling the pressure [Pat]

was feeling,” Congemi said. “I
haven’t been holding for‘ him for
about four or five weeks; I just
wanted to catch the ball and get my
fingers out of the way.”

That's because Viancourt is left-
footed and Congemi is more accus-

! tomed to the right-footed Schubert.

“Pat was as calm as ever,” he con-
tinued. “He came out and put his tee
down, which is” what is usually done
_— you just leave it where it falls and
don't move it.

“But he put it down, was getting
ready, and __then he picked it up.

The crucialiconversion salvaged a
decent first-half Pitt offense -that

ended its initial drive when a mis- ‘

guided Congemi pass fell into. line-
backer Tony Romano’_s hands.

“I wasn’t' happy with my perfor-

The Pitt News, Monday, October 3!,

‘L , " It’s not easy, but we’ll come

right out and say it: The past
weekend was one of horrendous
consequences. The Pitt News

staff of college football gurus all I

turned in weekend records of 8-7,
just barely keeping the credibility
alive, let alone illusions of spec-
talur above-500 ﬁnishes.

All is not lost, though. One
guru, Charlie “The Cheese"

.O'hara, coming off a horrendous

6-9 weekend himself, got out his
l0-foot pole and kept the dis-
tance from being swallowed by
sub-.500 performance monsters.

The Cheese not only redeemed
himself, he’s still smartmg from
that mug shot he took with
WTAE sportscaster Myron
Cope. The Cheese, lest it be for-
gotten, was also the only one of
five to pick UCLA over
Washington.

Other gurus pacing this week's
attack on college football games
"included two “Guest Gurus.

Cope and The New York Times \

‘Murry Chass. If you'll excuse the
expression, Chass really took a
nosedive and wiped out big time.

He went 4-ll. ~_

Maybe that's why trying to get
l5 prognostications from him
bore inmind thoughts of squeez-
ing blood from a rock.

Cope didn't do'too much bet-
ter himself, as a 6-9 record will
attest. Of course, many a person
has already slung his arms
around Myron’s shoulder for
those Polaroid pics. '

Could that be why Myron
seems so short?

We'll face it, though, all five of
us came up really short with
these 15 games picked out. In
that frenzy of a Pitt game, who

will ever forget the veteran play— '

ers twice, three times and some
even four times asking the name
of that kid kicking the game-
winning field goal.

PAT VIANCOU RT.

Now that that's been taken
care of, Viancourt’s coolness

 

under mounting pressure marks
the second consecutive week a
big game has been decided by the
five toes of a walk-on as well
known as the guy tending corner
news stands. Last week, Michi-
gan topped Iowa in the game’s
waning moments when a kid
named Bob Bergeron kicked for
three, paying about $9000 a year
in tuition for the privilege.

Say, Viancourt’s from out-of-
state, too. Maybe he, too, is fork-
ing over nearly the same amount
for such exclusive endeavors.

Still smirking from his own lit-
tle gamble is the “Grocery

, Gridiron Gurus

Mark A. Sindler..

Bagger,”
Though the Bagger is a little hurt
that he never received a give-
away at Saturday’s Pony Bag
Day at Pitt Stadium, he did
emerge with boldness, picking
Boston College over cross-state
Nittany Lions.

Like he said Friday, Penn
State does not own a ranked
passing defense. The Eagles’
Doug Flutie, behind a sixth-
ranked passing offense, passed
for two TDs.

Eat your hearts out.

That's exactly what some hoo-
pies down in West Virginia are
contemplating now that the
Mountaineers .have lost two
straight games. Saturday, Miami
(Fla.) pinned Jeff Hostetler &
Co. 20-3.

While down there, WVU was
expecting another return to the
Orange Bowl, but those hopes
were just’recently seen gliding
out" the window. Pass. that

Kleenex over to Don Nehlen,
please.

A wrench was thrown in the ,
process determining an Atlantic
Coast Conference champion
when Maryland upset North
Carolina on the Terps’ turf 28,-
26. Another one was supplied at
the Los Angeles Memorial Coli-
seum, where UCLA upset PAC-
l0 rival Washington 27-24,

That conference will now
search its soul deeper to emerge‘
with a Rose Bowl representative.
It’s still too early to adequately
find one. That is not the ca_se in
the Big 10.

Its leader, Illinois (7-1 overall,
6-0) threw water on Michigan’s
paper towel hopes when the
home team Illini swamped the
Wolverines l6-6. OK, maybe it
really wasn’t a swamp, but shoot,
Illinois is now giving travel
agents headaches.

/ Most schools would love to
have such headaches.

Meantime, we’ll just work on
scraping yet another Guest Guru
for thevcoming weekend.

And already, the ghosts to
Notre Dame’s past are beginning
to be heard. What do your ears
tell you. Foge Fazio.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

‘Pact’?!  . I

   

_\

by Karen Frost

All over campus, from
classrooms to dorm lobbies,
we’ve been plagued with pos-
ters telling us who we should
vote for and why. Yet for
those newcomers to Pitt,
who may be awed by the
show of posters, this year’s
campaign is actually on a

smaller scale than previous ’

campaigns.

Jim Brady, chairperson of
the Elections Committee, is
keeping a close eye on this
year’s campaigning. The
committee’s policy of strictly
enforcing election codes this
year is a response to the

numerous complaints from ‘

administrators and university
staff concerning, last year’s
campaigning, specifically in
regard to the posters which
covered and lettered our
campus. As a new rule, candi-
dates are limited to one pos-
ter per classroom or bulletin
board. Other bylaws were
also revised over the‘ summer
to reduce confusion on part
of the candidates. One such
rule stated that candidates
had to submit thier campaign
staff lists in typewritten form.
This rule has been ommitted
from the bylaws. These may
seem like minor changes, but
without them students aren’t
always sure about the proce-
dures. For instance, last year

a student from another Pitt’

campus tried to run for board
president at this campus. He
pointed out that it was not
cited in .the bylaws that a can-
didate must be a student at
the main campus in order to
run for ‘board president.

For the most part, the Elec-
tions Committee has had full

,4

< ‘Spotlight

cooperation from this year’s.
' candidates. The exception

was the disqualification of
one candidate, Laura Elai-
son. She was disqualified
because her posters were put
up before the campaign
period began. .

Brady would like to stress
how important the student
vote is because the Student
Government Board not only
has a strong impact on uni-
versity policies, but is also
responsible for the manage-
ment of over $300,000 which
is provided by the student
activities fee.

We would like to thank the
Elections Committee for
doing such a fine job this year
under Brady’s direction.
Brady was formerly the chair-
person of the Legal Aware-
ness Committee and
currently works in the Judi-
cial Affairs office as an assist-
ant advocate. He is a senior
and is completing a double

major in political science and -

history. He hopes to attend
Pitt’s‘ law school after
graduation. «

Defining SGB
by Athena Zaras

A student wearing an SGB
campaign button frantically
approached me and urged
me to votefor his candidate. I

_ asked him for the candidate’s

qualifications, and with no
hesitation, the student
rattled-off a list of extracur-
riculars that would be typical
of any SGB candidate.
' My next question, how-
ever, stumped him. I,_s,imply
asked, “Do you know what
SGB does?” He tried to avoid
the question by stating what
the initials “S” “G” “B” stand
for. I persisted, and he could
only further endorse his can-
didate. Ironically, he had no
conception of what SGB
does. Do you? Unfortu-
nately, if the students cam-
paigning for their friends
don’t know what SGB does,
imagine the ignorance of the
rest of the population of stu-
dents on campus.

Update
by Dan Vuic

CHANCELLOR’S DIS-
TINGUISHED TEACH-

ING AWARD—Mark

Downs, SGB President,
recently wrote letters to the
Nursing Student Organiza-
tion, Engineering Student
Cabinet and the Pharmacy
Student Organization urging
them to nominate candidates
for the Chancellor’s Distin-
guished Award. He also
asked the Board members to
contact their liaison groups
and tell them to nominate
someone for the award. The
deadline for nominations is
November 1.

WRITERS’ CONFER-
ENCE—Kathy Brown is ask-
ing the Board to accept a
$2,000 emergency request
for the-Writers’ Conference.
Although the conference is
not a recognized organiza-

tion. Kath feels that it is a

.-....~.u-ua.n--a. -
/

dent Government Board.
What is it? And what does it
do? The Student Govern-
ment Board, consisting of
eight board members and a
president, is responsible for
allocating about $300,000 in
student activity fee .money to
itself, eight standing commit-
tees, six governance groups
and approximately 100 stu-
dent organizations.

The Allocations Commit-
tee, which also consists of
eight appointed members
and a chairperson, reviews all
submitted budget packets
and makes recommenda-
tions to the Student Govern-
ment Board for funding. The
Board may accept the com-
mittee’s recommendations or
reject the proposal and
reconstruct the budget as
desired.

In addition to this, the
board is open to work on any
new project that will address
student needs. This year, for
example, the Board was the
back bone in establishing the
LSAT preparatory course for

know that it stands for Stu- _ ‘I tl_-jog stgdggts who wish to

worthwhile organization that
benefits students. The prim-
ary purpose of the Confer-
ence is to aid students who
are interested in writing as a
career. Kathy feels that
because Pitt offers no jour-
nalism major the organiza-
tion merits funding. This is
one of her main arguments to
persuade the Allocations

I Committee and the Board to

recommend funding for the
Conference.
REMUNERATION IS-
SUE——Kathy Brown is trying
to form a committee to look
into and review the remuner-
ation procedure for chairper-
sons. This comes after Kevin
Stark, Greek Week chairper-
son, came to the Board seek-
ing remuneration for the
position he held.
STUDENT GOVERN-
MENT BOARD ASSEMB-
LY——Jeff Schaffer wrote a
letter to al of the student —
organizations informing them
of the first meeting of the Stu-

‘I-x«'.¢..:..:ii£}.usi.ui.'inir:

take the Law School
Entrance exam. The Board‘
was responsible for research-
ing into the companies and
finding the best opportunities
for pre-law students on
campus. I '

Furthermore, the Intern-
ship Office reinstatement
project is still underway by
the Board. The petitions are
presently circulating the cam-
pus, and many thanks to the
Board for its efforts to bring
this important student ser-
vice back to Pitt.

The Student Government
Board is also the students’
voice to the hierarchy of the

- university. Board members,

especially the president,

meet with‘ faculty and admin- _

istration to discuss student
views and possible improve-
ments for the university.
“SGB” stands for you and
your needs as students on

time you see the letters “S”

over them——remember, they
represent YOU.

dent Government Board
Assembly. The first meeting
is November 8 at 6:00 p.m. in
the William Pitt Union.’

FUNDING INCREASE-

According to Jeff Schaffer,
legislation is now before our
state representatives in Har-
risburg which, if passed,
could mean a 16.5 percent
increase in funding to Pitt.

“We took a good shotbut came up

short,” said Collier.
“Women’s sports are getting bigger
and bigger in other parts of the
country, and it’s tougher and
tougher for us to remain nationally
successful.”

Despite coming up short, the Pitt
players displayed some strong net
playing. Middle-blocker Kohutiak
drilled l4 kill shots, and Pat Belcher
appeared in good shape after three
weeks of very limited action due to
off-season knee surgery. Belcher,
who has also. seen limited ‘practice
time, contributed seven kills and
committed only one net error.

Collier also commended sopho-
mores Tapia and Sally Gillespie.

“Carmen and Sally conti ue to

. take an increasingly important lead-

ership role. They really understand
what makes our team tick,” The
coach remarked. “They know what
it will take to win at the Big East
tournament and the NCAAs.”
Collier hopes the confidence and
intensity levels in his players con-
tinue their upward surge at Pitt’s
Converse assic next weekend.

When Judy Lafferty
prepares for a race,
she checks every part

,of her bike.

Because she checks
her body the same ‘
way, she discovered a
lump in her breast a
few ears ago. '

She discovered it
early. And these days,
85% -of early breast
cancers can be treated I
successfully. 

Judy has since had
reconstructive surgery,
too. And she feels like
herself again. Alive,
vibrant, ready.to get
on her bike and take
on the world.

Judy Lafferty is liv-
ing proof of the pro-
gress we're making
against cancer.

The American
Cancer Society takes
some credit for that
progress. But credit
won't finance our
work.

- We need our
money to he p us win
this race.
