Coben responds to Republican opponent ’s charges

By Shawn McClearn
For The Pitt News

Pointing to his experience and
ability to work with people, as
well as his opponent’s lack of
programs, Democratic City
Council candidate Dan Cohen
feels confident that he will win
the race for the District 8 seat.

“Theres a stark difference
between [Republican candidate
Mary Caroline Hunt’s] and my

stands on the issues and our

approaches to government. I
have specific programs for
addressing the issues of crime,
economic development, and
taxes. My opponent does not.

“Moreover, I believe that
government can take the lead in
addressing the problems of
discrimination against women,
minorities and the impoverished.
My opponent does not.”

Cohen also said that he has
the ability to get these things
done, and the record to prove it.

“Because I have the
experience and specific
programs to address the serious
challenges facing Pittsburgh. As
a trial lawyer, Iework every day
with adversaries and allies and
achieve agreements. I’ll bring
this experience and ability to
bear on city council.

“Finally, I can work with the
Democratic mayor and the other
members of city council to
deliver for this district and
Pittsburgh.” .

Cohen said that if he had to
choose the most important issue
of the campaign, it would be the
rising crime rate in the
community, noting a signiﬁcant

increase in property crimes in
the 8th district, especially
burglary and car theft.

He added that burglary has
increased by 27 percent in the
past year, and that 20 percent of
all car thefts in Pittsburgh occur
in the 8th district. To combat
these problems, Cohen has
proposed the creation of a
burglary task force and the
implementation of two anti-car
theft programs.

Concerning the issue of
domestic violence, Cohen said
that the Women’s Center and
Shelter had to turn away 553
victims of physical abuse,
including children, due to lack
of space. This shortage, Cohen
said, was because of insufficient
funding. “It's a disgrace that we
aren’t now able to protect every
victim of domestic violence.”

Cohen said he would like to
see city government try to
provide additional funding for
the Women’s Center and other
shelters. He added that he
wanted to see a special room in
the Allegheny County
courthouse opened for
counseling women seeking
Protection From Abuse orders.

Cohen also pointed to the
growing problem of hunger and
homelessness in Pittsburgh, and
said he will seek funding from
county, state, and local
governments for local food
banks and soup kitchens, noting
that between 1980 and 1987,
emergency food requests have
increased 1,700 percent.

Cohen said he also proposed
a privately funded insurance

Many of the finalists, such as
Chappale Burton put a lot of
work into their campaign. Burton
also ran last year, but he said, "I
didn’t have a lot of time to put
into it last year, so I ran again and
did things right. I was glad to be

Homecoming Court '89 decided

because he made many friends at

“I hope the reason that someone
voted for me was because I’m

reason, just because that’s the
way I am,” said Pizano.

Keith Barsky had support from
his fraternity, Pi Kappa Phi, but
he said that he also cornered the
freshman vote. “I was a mentor

Fraternity helps to feed

Hill district homeless

By Jenifer Crook
Staff Writer

As the kick-off to Kappa
Alpha Psi fraternity’s drive to
“improve their image on
campus,” brothers of the Pitt
organization spent their
Saturday morning helping to
feed many of Pittsburgh's
homeless people. ~

All 10 of_'Kappa Alpha Psi’s
brothers volunteered their time

V from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the

Jubilee Kitchen in the Hill
District, a non-profit
organization that feeds area
homeless people seven days a
week. The brothers prepared,
cooked and served brunch and

a main meal to the needy
people who showed up at the
kitchen.

“The brunch consisted of
coffee and donuts, and we
served macaroni, salad, hot
dogs, bread and butter for the
main meal,” said Dave Collins,
fraternity vice-president. “It
was a fun ‘time. We got the
chance to mix and interact
with the homeless people of
Pittsburgh. For many of them,
it was the only meal they
would get that day. It was nice
to help them out."

Collins said the project was
just the first of many the group
has planned for this semester.

“We will keep [helping at

New nursing group
reflects attitude change

By Chantal Evans
For The Pitt News

Hoping to achieve a more
powerful impact at Pitt, two
student nursing groups have
combined to form the Pitt Nursing
Association.

Sharon Kuhn, president of the
Pitt Nursing Association, said the
group was formed because [the
nurses] want to focus on a more
professional attitude in the
nursing school. In the past the
Nursing Student Organization was
mainly the governing group, and
the Student Nurse’s Association
of Pennsylvania concentrated on
the professional awareness.

The new organization consists
of about 500 nursing students
and is funded only by the Student
Government Board. They receive
$8,500 a year. These funds go
toward service projects such as
the Western Psych Christmas Party
and resolution writings.

Two resolutions have already
been written by Pitt nursing
students on a national level this
year. One was written by Sarah
Pracht on “Hepatitis B Vaccine,”
and the other was done by Kris
Closky on,“Bicycle Safety." Kuhn
also wrote a resolution on the
homeless in the state of California.

The group also attends national

" conventions to educate the nurses

politically about what is going on
career-wise in their field.

The activities are divided
among the different ‘branches of
the committee: allocating, nursing
affairs,
professional development and
correspondence. J ,

Generally, Kuhn said that the
change in combining the
organizations came about
because the professional aspect
was not taken seriously enough.

“We are just trying to bring out
what is, important . —
professionalism,” Kuhn said.

’Remote Control’ host to make Pitt appearance tonight

By Lou Grieco
News Editor

Ken Ober, the host of MTV's
game show‘ “Remote Control,”
will realize a lifelong dream today
when the “The Out of the
Basement T our” makes a stop at
the University of Pittsburgh.

“This will be my first time in
Pittsburgh,” Ober said in a phone
interview yesterday. “Twice »I’ve
set out to see baseball games, but
I’ve never made it.

“I've always been a big fan of
the Pittsburgh Pirates, especially
Roberto Clemente. One year, I
dressed up as Manny Sanguillen
for Halloween."

Ober and his Remote Control
sidekick Colin Quinn will be at
Carnegie Music Hall tonight,
hosting what is being described
as a “live event not fit’ for
television.” It will I open with
appearances by stand up comics,

I and then Ober and Quinn will

introduce four Pitt students
chosen to be the contestants in a
one-hour specially formatted
game that will not be taped.

I The winner of the game will
ﬂy to New York to be a contestant
in a game that will be taped, and
shown on MTV later. _ p

According to Ober, the on-
campus shows have been
“unbelievable. We almost broke

A into “Satisfaction” at the last show.

“The show at West Point was
weird, but still fun. It was weird
because [the audience] was made
up of 99 percent guys. We

' expected the worst, but it went

  

well. They
enthusiastic.”
Remote Control is based on
television trivia, and with
categories like “Brady Bunch
Physics,” it may be the dream
game show for TV addicts. The
show started on MTV two years
ago as what Ober described as an
“experiment” for the channel.
“The first season it was a very
loose framework,” he said. “It
took us the whole ﬁrst season to
find our groove. MTV is always
trying to come up with the next
step, and [the executives] wanted
to get away from just video. Two
men, Michael Dugan and Joseph
Davola were told to create a

were I very

. game show. I

“They said to themselves, ‘Look

what's happened to our society. I

We just sit around V ﬂipping
channels with the remote control,’
which is true. We don’t even
have the attention span to watch
whole shows. I watch three things
at a time. That’s kind of the idea
from which the game, and the
title, came from.”

Ober lived in Boston as a child,
until his family moved to Hartford.
He attended the University of
Massachusetts, majoring in
education and communications.
After becoming interested in
theater in college, Ober started
working in community theater
projects while I working as a
substitute teacher. In 1983, he
began to pursue a career in stand-
up comedy in New York City.

MTV executives discovered

‘Ober performing at a comedy

 
 

\.‘?55S\’

110 S. Bouquet St.
Oakland

club called the Improvisation in
1987, and asked him to audition
for the host of their new game
show. Because the show was so
bizarre, Ober was not sure it
would last.

“When it began to hit I was
very surprised,” he said. “We
literally can’t go anywhere now
[without being recognized]. One
time Colin and I were in an
emergency room in Florida. Two
doctors wheeled a patient past
us, stopped, wheeled the patient
back and asked if we were the
guys from Remote Control.

“Another time, I had two kids
from Sweden stop me in an
airport. The show is big in Europe,
and it is a huge hit in Australia. It
kind of blows me away.”

Now the show that Ober and
others at MTV thought might not
be a success is in its third season
on MTV, as well as its third week
of syndication on other stations
across the country. Ober

' attributed the success to different

factors. .

“I think the show works on
different levels,” he said. “For
one thing, people like to play
along with game shows. Another
thing is that we’re not saying that

there's anything important about I

the Brady family. It’s totally
unnecessary information.

“The attitude came out by
accident. The show is very honest.
Sometimes we get on a contestant
after answering a question
correctly for even retaining, this
kind of information."

Ober also said that though he is

By Maria Perez
For The Pitt News

This year, President Wesley W. J’

Posvar awarded faculty members
with the President’s Distinguished
Research Awards in a ceremony

“also held for the President's

Distinguished Teaching Awards
and the Master Scholar and
Professor Award. J

On Sept. 21, six faculty
members received the first awards
for achievements in research. The
research accomplishments of
Dennis P. Curran, Department of
Chemistry; Mary Edmonds,
of Biological
Sciences; Esther Gal-or, The
Joseph M. Katz Graduate School
of Business; John Hiserodt,
Department of Pathology; Ezra T.
Newman, Department of Physics
and Astronomy; and John T.’
Yates, Jr., Department of
Chemistry were honored.

The Master Scholar _and
Professor Award went to Professor

Adolf Grunbaum, chairman of
Pitt's Center for Philosophy of
Science, and first non-Nobel
laureate to win the 1989 Fregene
Prize for Science in Rome. Dr.
Dennis P. Curran, a synthetic
organic chemist at the University
of Pittsburgh, won an award for
his research in free radical

strategies for making organic;

molecules.

Curran said he is not sure of the
criteria candidates must meet to
win an award but said the
department nominated him when
a colleague wrote a letter
recommending him, citing his
previous awards and research.

Professors from all Pitt
campuses are eligible, but Curran
said, “Smaller campuses are more

concemed with teaching than

with research."

Although Yates is also from the
Department of Chemistry, his
research was independent of
Curran’s work.

Each member received $1,000

for personal use and $4,000 for
their research.

The same monetary awards
went to the winners of the
President’s Distinguished
Teaching Awards. Those awarded
were Ronald Brand, School of
Law; Nancy Estrada, the
Humanities (Spanish),
Greensburg Campus; Janelle
Greenberg, Department of
History; and Sally Murphy,
Department of Communications.

As stated in the guidelines
distributed by the provost to all
the faculty members, eligible
faculty members include those
who are active, full-time teachers
in a three-year period at Pitt,
according to Dr. Margaret
Waterman of the Department of
Faculty Development.

Someone, like a student,
alumnus, teacher or department
chairperson who has evidence of
the candidate’s character, may
submit a letter describing the
teacher’s strength.

provide that money goes toward
feeding the hungry, instead of to
insurance payments. He said he
would also like to see the number
of lines on the hunger hotline
increased to make _sure that
people will knowiwhere to get
food when they need it, and that
city government should ensure,
through private funding sources,

that no one should have to sleep
without shelter unless they want
to.

«I  Another of Cohen's concerns is

that Pittsburgh is losing the
competition with other major
cities in the country for jobs and
business. “We’re losing because
.we’re not selling Pittsburgh
enough,” he said.

To deal ‘with this problem,
Cohen said he. has proposed the

-creation of an Office of Economic a

Development to aggressively
bring businesses to Pittsburgh. "1
also think we’ must help those
who have the guts to start their
own business. T hat’s why I’ve
devised a small business incubator
program and joint marketing
€ffOI'I;"

According to Cohen, the costs
of these programs would not
greatly burden taxpayers due to
the fact that much of the funding
would come from private sources.
Cohen also made the following
proposals to maximize revenue
intake for city government:
reorganize priorities in the city
budget in the attempt to eliminate
inefficiency; and obtain revenue-

sharing acts with the county, state,
and federal governments.

Cohen said this was justifiable
because Pittsburgh provides
many cultural, educational, and
medical services for the region of
western Pennsylvania with very
little reimbursement. He alsosaid
that it is only fair that non—residents
of Pittsburgh who work in the
city pay some sort of municipal
services tax, since residents of
the city who work here must pay
a 3.5 percent wage tax.

When asked what direction he
would like to see city government
head Pittsburgh toward for the
1990's, Cohen said, “I think that
we can stimulate economic
revitalization and lead Pittsburgh
into becoming a more progressive
and dynamic city.”

After reviewing the letter, the
provost collects data in the form
of a dossier. In the dossier, the
teacher must include
instructional materials from two
courses. Examinations and syllabi
are such materials. The dossier
also requires graded papers
showing the teacher’s feedback
to students. Candidates must
make a list of accomplishments
such as devising a new course,
participating on a committee,
supervising graduate students, or
getting grants, which manifest
work outside the classroom but
still relate to teaching. Teachers
must also write a two-page paper
on what an effective teacher is
and how they feel they fulﬁll
those requirements.

After the written work of the
professor, colleagues must submit
their evaluations of the teacher.
Some choose to sit in on the class
to evaluate the candidate.

The dean or the department

chairperson also must write a ,

students for more advanced
classes, the head of the
department is obligated to tell so.

The provost then appoints a
committee to judge the
candidates. This year, eight faculty
members and two undergraduate
students made up the committee.

There are about 40 candidates,

and “there is no formula for

judging an excellent teacher,” said
Waterman;

The committee goes through
the dossiers and makes

before the winners
announced.

Waterman said the process is
“not political; it is very unbiased.”

In less than one week, all ofPitt -

will no doubt look like some-
thing right out of a big Prince
video — with all the gleaming
co-eds bopping around singing
the very words that appear itali-
cized above this column. No, it
won’t be a result of last week-

from something big. Very big. Be

elections for Homecoming King
and Queen.‘ If you're like most
God-fearing, Tang—drinking
Americans, I’m sure you are well
aware of the magnitude of this
event. In fact, this writer wouldn’t
be surprised if you’ve only had
five hours of sleep in the last 10
days —— in eager anticipation of
the’election’s outcome. E

Much to everyone’s surprise,

Black Action Society

To study the aspects of black
thought and practice in their
historical and current unfolding.
That is the purpose of any Black
Studies program at any univer-
sity. However, that definition
doesn’t offer any valid reason
why we would want to pursue
information in this field. To find
these reasons we'll have to look
deeper into the purpose of the
“university,” and into the racial
history of our nation. There are
many goals or responsibilities of
the “university” in our society,
but the ones that are fulfilled by
Black Studies programs concern
the truth. One of a university's
goals is to teach the whole truth.
However, our history courses, as
they now exist, are unable to
meet this goal, since they consis-
tently leave out the contribution
of the Afro-Americans to our
society. We, as students, are only
getting half of the truth. Thus,
there exists a proven need for a

there are a few foul-smell’n ver-
min ‘round here who have the
audacity to suggest that home-
coming elections are silly. These
are_ the same people (if they can
be called that) who say there is
no need to have a Homecoming
King 0rQueen. They would rather
not have to look at all those
posters everywhere that feature
smiling inmates (uh, I mean in-
grates) who want everyone to
admire their beauty — as well as
appreciate their uncanny ability
to waste money at the printers’.
They’d rather drink their beer
and get goofy without the pomp
and circumstance come Oct. 14.
It’s hard to believe, but it’s true.

Have certain members of our
campus community forgotten that
the selection of our Homecom-
ing King and Queen is as impor-
tant a decision as selecting a
major — or preferred brand of
toothpaste?

Our King and Queen will not
only represent our school on the
football ﬁeld but also bear the
awesome responsibility to con-
summate their relationship in

Black Studies program. The sec-
ond, and probably most impor-
tant reason for the establishment
of such a program is to combat
racism. Many racist beliefs, if not
all, are based on assumptions,
stereotypes, misconceptions, and
just plain lack of knowledge. It is
my belief that the problem of
racism can be substantially elimi-
nated by teaching all students as

I to the true role of the Afro—Ameri-

can.

l...] If the university is truly con-
cerned with these goals, it would
make a Black Studies course a
requirement for CAS students. Or
can the university live with teach-
ing its students only half of the
truth? Shouldn't an Afro—Ameri-

ment, or is the university satisfied
with the amount of racial tension
that exists? Is it more important to

have a bastard“ court! The new
Royal Court must also defend Pitt
against all evils, which inherently
includes the use of any tyrannical
power deemed necessary. Real-
izing the severity of the two posts,

 

this writer would like to say
“kudos” to all those candidates
who have done _a marvelous job
in informing the voters of their
credentials. ,
Most “legitimate candidates” —
or at least those with 2Q teeth in
their mouth and a $10 haircut —
are endorsed. One candidate for
King is endorsed byﬁve fraterni-
ties! In fact, two of the fraternities
backing this leader up just hap-
pen to include the notable Delta-
We-Love-To-Fly fraternity as well
as the Gamma-Raybunch. If this
ﬁne gent is elected, perhaps all
incoming freshman (Greek or not)
will have to roll around nude in
a vat of Crisco and then skinny-
dip in a pond of molasses. “King

Hazing” he could be called.

My personal favorite candidate
for King is endorsed by the rowing
club. This is a very important
aspect of his candidacy. If Pitt
were attacked by say, Point Park
College, it would beideal to have
a “Skipper-Type” in office. He
could raise a navy within minutes
and strategically use the area’s
three. rivers to plan a counter-
attack.

Choosing a Queen is just as
important. It would be really neat
if our reigning beauty had at least
a 3.0 QPA — then we could all
dub her “Queen B,” which would
be delightfully cute. Our Queen
should also be of pure character.
Last week, one candidate made
headlines (or so this writer pre-
tends in order to make a point)
for charges of “being a tramp.” It
turns out that she was fooling
around with Robert Morris a
couple of years ago and has a few
“illegitimate credits.”

So as not to offend our future
King and Queen, this writer has
been very careful not -to endorse
any one particular candidate.
Remember though, electing our

Royal Court isn’t a load of doogie
— it's some serious sh—! After
all, our Royal T wosome will most
likely reside in the “King’s Court"
movie theater, which means that

they'll have control over the Rocky 0

Horror Picture Sbow, as well as
Pittsburgh's third largest supply
of popcorn." _

Like I said, this is big stuﬂ-—
very big stuﬂ.

My only suggestion for next
year would be that Pitt establish
a new office for homecoming

that'co—eds without $10 haircuts 0

could seek—HomecomingCourt
Jester. Things are just so damn
serious around the Royal Court
these days dude that we could all
use _a little lighthearted ribbing. If
the new office were created, one
question would come to mind:
what changes in the campaign
posters would have to be made

from the current ones used to_«,.
promote candidates for King and

Queen?
Answer: Not one, gentle reader.
Not one.

Disagree? Agree? Send a letter

I to the editor. This is how each

Perspectives page in TbePittNews
ends. Well, on Sept. 6, an article
about racial tensions appeared in
7bePitt News. I chose to disagree
with the way the editorial was
presented, in particular a line that
read, “For the past few nights,

black youths from local, predorni- '

nantly black colleges have been
celebrating the end of summer
by committing acts of violence
and looting stores. Let’s hope this
does not become a traditional
way to celebrate the arrival of fall
all over the United States." Though
the rest of the article went on to
say we should look for ways to
end racial violence, this particu-
lar line represents a stereotypical

 

misrepresentation that I could
not ignore. However, the editor
chose not to print my editorial for
reasons still unknown to me. In
her opinion it was not meant to
be racist.

Whether or not we intend to
say something we must all be re-
sponsible for our actions and
words and the way that they are
perceived, especially a journal-
ist.[...l We, as students, must be
concerned with our rnis—educa—
tion as well as our education. We
cannot consume “facts” just be-
cause an authority says this is
“fact.” We must learn to question
the information that we are re-
ceiving, be it professors, news-
papers, or history text books.

I believe that most racial ten-
sion is brought about because of
our mis-education. Simple things,
like the reference in the article,
compound to reinforce the stere-
otypes about black people. It can
be as simple as a cartoon like

Tom and Jerry with their depic-
tion of the black housekeeper, or
as complex as the movie Missis-
sippi Burning with the depiction

[of] the FBI as the saviours. I ’

could go on and on with the
everyday occurrences of sublimi-
nal, and subversive ‘propaganda
that reinforces negative racist
attitudes. ' ,;

p Unless we think that these racist
attitudes are acceptable in our
society, we must make a con-
scious effort to gather all the
information from all sides before

making a judgement. The Pitt 0

News, in particular, must allow
both sides of a story to be told, as
they have allowed me to do here.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Staff Writer

As a native of Youngstown,
Ohio, Pitt fullback Derrick Lewis
grew up watching Panther
fodtball. As a youngster he often
dreamed that some day he could
play college football at Pitt.

“It’s something I had watched
on TV all my life,” said Lewis. “At
WVU, with the fans booing the
team and the people going crazy,
it felt real good. It was like a
dream come true. To actually
play made it even better.”

In fact, the whole Panther team
is getting better this year.
According‘ to Lewis, the
improvement is due to the way
the team sticks together.

“We have team unity. We
practice hard, but we practice
together," said Lewis. “That’s
something a lot of Division .I
schools can’t do, knowing when
to slow down and knowing when
to speed up."

With all the intricate plays
involved in college football, it is
often hard for freshmen to know
what to do. Being red-shirted last
year has proven to be a wise
decision by Pitt head coach Mike
Gottfried.

“The extra year helped a lot,
more school-wise than football-
wise,” said Lewis. “Coach
Gottfried did what he thought
[was] best. It was the best move
for me.”

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

In January of 1984, Rose
Winand was involved in a
shooting accident that left her
without the use of her legs. Six
months later she was playing
basketball and racquetball, and
two weeks ago she won the Great
Race handicapped division with
a time of 35:45. Being confined to
a wheelchair has not extinguished
the athletic fire in Winand.

Winand has also won several
other local road races this year,
including the Parkersburg Half
Marathon and the Brookline
Breeze.

“I've been racing since 1985,
but only seriously for about the
last year. Before that, I did it just
for the hell of it," Winand said. °

She has also traveled to
Cleveland, Minnesota and
Washington D.C. to race. Last

July, she ﬁnished 10th at the

Peachtree 10K World Wheelchair
Championships in Atlanta, which
brought racers from all over the
world.

Before her accident, Winand
competed in team sports such as
softball and basketball, but now
she concentrates on road racing.

Winand got involved in
wheelchair athletics at the
Harrnarville Rehabilitation Center,
which has a wheelchair basketball

team called the Pittsburgh Steel ,

Wheelers.

“I wasn't really interested in '

playing basketball, but some
people also ran road races, so I
started doing that,” Winand said.

thought nobody could stop me,”
Lewis said. “Then Curvin
[Richards] ran up to me and hit
me harder than anybody hit me
all night. It was my first big game

_ and my family was watching. It

was an undescribable feeling."
The 6-foot—2-inch, 225-pound
urban studies‘ major describes
himself as someone who can get
along with, just about anyone and

likes to listen. One important
time Lewis listened is when his
gra=rrdf'at‘ner made him play
football at age eight.

“I had no idea what I was
doing. I got knocked around, so
I kind of figured it out,” said
Lewis. “I was out there running
scared, so I learned how to play
without getting my head knocked
off.”

Whereas his grandfather was
important in his football life, his
grandmother kept the rest of his
life in perspective.

“My grandmother had plenty
of times when she could have
given up, but she always found a

way to get by,” said Lewis. “Now ’

when I face adversity and want to
give up, _ I remember my
grandmother, and that helps a
lot."

As far as his present football
days are concerned, helping the
Pitt Panther team is his main
objective. ,

“I do my part the best I can,” he
said. “If something happens or
comes my way, great. I think if
you set too many personal goals,
you forget all about the team. I
like the friends you make. I also
like the physical contact.an<;l,,tl1e

The game of football is unlike
that of any other outdoor sport,
when not considering the
unignorably sterilizing effect of
domed stadiums, in the sense
that regardless -of the mood

It might be cold as all hell or

Now, of course, there are
extreme conditions, like big blasts
of lightning out of the sky, or
deadly hurricanes blowing off
the coast, in which officials might
consider postponing a scheduled

of what went on between the
sidelines on those particular
days.

Let me take you back...

The Ice Bowl, Green Bay
vs. Dallas, Dec. 31, 1967

Packer weather.

Certain Packers claim they
weren't affected by the Arctic
conditions, possibly because they
were used to it, possibly because
their brain cells were locked in a
deep freeze.

“The cold never came into my

head; I never thought about the

. cold because I wanted to win the

game so bad,” said Ray Nitschke,
the Hall of Fame Green Bay
linebacker. ‘

Said Packer offensive lineman '

Jerry Kramer, another Hall-of-

Famer, “I don’t think the cold.

us. We were so wrapped up in

think about it” ..
The Cowboys disagree about

I the weather’s frozen impact

“You had no feeling in your
said Dan Reeves,
currently the coach of the Denver
Broncos. “There’s nobody that
has an advantage in that kind of
weather. That’s cold; I mean, it
was miserable.”

“The band was out there, you
know, to play before the game,”
recalls Rentzel, “and we looked
over there, and I saw like 1 5 guys
in the tuba and trumpet section,

 

 

and all their faces had blood all
over them. What had happened
[was] they were going out there
to play, and the instruments had
stuck to their lips, and when they
pulled the instruments away, it
just ripped all the skin on their
lips off.”

Green Bay powered out to a
14-0 second-quarter lead on two
touchdown passes from
quarterback Bart Starr to ﬂanker
Boyd Dowler. Dallas cut the lead
to 14-10 before halftime on a 7-
yard Starr fumble return by
defensive end George Andrie and
a 21-yard field goal by Danny
Villanueva.

“I guess one of my most vivid J

memories of the game is of Bob
Hayes, the widereceiver for the
Dallas Cowboys, running his pass
patterns with his hands in his
pants,” recalled Kramer. “He put
both hands down the front of his
pants, andhe would run a pass
pattern with his hands still in his
pants." J

The Cowboys eventually took
the lead midway through the
fourth quarter on a tricky halfback
option pass from Reeves to
Rentzel. And when the Packers
took over on their final
possession, only 4:40 remained
on the game clock. 69 yards
separated‘ them from the end
zone. ‘

Methodically’ plodding their

way up the field, Starr moved his
team upfield on a smooth blend
of runs and passes until Green
Bay had a first down on the
Dallas 1-yard line with under a
minute left to play.

The Dallas defense stopped RB
Donnie Anderson twice on
consecutive running plays, but
then with 20 seconds on the
clock and no time outs remaining,
Starr snuck into the end zone
behind guard Jerry Kramer for a

(21-17 Green Bay win.

The Ice Bowl 11, Cincinnati
vs. San Diego, Jan. 10, 1982

It was colder than a stuck-up
blonde. ,

This Ice Bowl was‘ played for
the 1981 AFC Championship
game, matching the warm-
blooded San Diego Chargers and
the Cincinnati Bengals. At game
time in Cincinnati’s Riverfront
Stadium, the temperature at game
time dipped to 11 below zero,
with a stiff wind driving the wind
chill factor down to 59 below.

“I can’t remember a day colder
than this one,” said Cincinnati
coach Forrest Gregg after his team
had captured a relatively easy 27-
7 win, where the weather had
given the Bengals more fits than
the Chargers. Greg was an expert
on such chilling conditions, as he
was a member of the Packer team
that had participated in Ice Bowl
I. V

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, October 11, 1989

Coming off a highly exciting
but exhausting contest the week
before with Miami, the Chargers
were physically and emotionally
inno position to deal with the
bone-freezing conditions that
prevailed on that day, and their
famed passing attack was no
match for the bitter winds that
swept off the Ohio River and into
Riverfront. The strange thing was
that it only seemed to be cold on
one side of the line of scrimmage;
Cincinnati, behind the accurate
short passes of QB Ken Anderson,
the power running of fullback
Pete Johnson and a sly defense
that pinned’ up San Diego’s
dynamic receiving trio of Kellen
Winslow, Chuck Muncie and Wes
Chandler, skated out to a 10-0
lead and ended up with its first
AFC championship. ‘

The Snow Bowl, Cincinnati
vs. Pittsburgh, Nov. 28, -1976

Riverfront Stadium was also
the sight for this classic. In a
game absolutely crucial to the
playoff hopes of both teams, the
Steelers and the Bengals slid
around the turf in I a ‘freak
snowstorm that reduced visibility

Grounds crew members were
armed with brooms and a
snowplow in their losing effort to
keep the ﬁeld markings visible.

Pittsburgh gained a lot of yards
and had a fairly easy time moving
the football through the white
stuff. Rocky Bleier led all rushers
with 97 yards on 16 carries; Franco
Harris chipped. in 87 on 26.
Kruczek’s passing was
respectable when considering the
conditions; he completed 10 of
his 15 throws for 163 yards. His
quarterback sneaks also proved
to be very effective in the snow.
But, predictably, penalties and
turnovers seemedto stall every
Steeler drive.

The Bengal offense didn’t fare

much better. Cincy quarterback.

Ken Anderson and the team’s
high-powered offense was as
effective as a Big Wheel in a
snow drift. “I can't recall playing
in a worseisnow, ” said Anderson.

“I don’t know, I thought you
could say he had an advantage. I
couldn’t even see Kenny from 25

yards back,” said Steeler safety

Mike V Wagner. “When the ball
was in the air, I couldn’t see it

until, it was halfway to the

receiver.”

One guy that didn't mind the

snow was Pittsburgh offensive
guard, Jim Clack. He had to block
Bengal giant Bob Brown, a 280
pound defensive tackle.

"Man, I was glad to see the
snow," said Clack. "When you're
across from a guy as big as Brown,
you need all the help you can
get."

Then, in the waning moments
of the third quarter, a Boobie
Clark fumble gave the Steelers
possession just inside Cincinnati’s
25-yard line. A 14-yard pass from
Kruczek to Lynn Swann put
Pittsburgh at the Bengals’ II. A
Bleier run brought the snowball
to the 4-yard line, setting up the
game’s winning score. Harris
skied through the white stuff and
between. linemen for the final
distance. 7-3, Steelers.

The win, paired with a 23-6 S

victory over Cincinnati in the

sixth week of the season,
eventually gave the Steelers a
tiebreaking edge over the Bengals
and led to another AFC Central
title for Pittsburgh.

Said an obviously disheartened
Johnson, “The snow was
deﬁnitely a factor, but I don't
want to construe that as an alibi.
I’d have like to have played them
on a_dry field, but even on a dry
ﬁeld they rnight’ve beaten us.”

The Monsoon Bowl, Tampa
Bay vs. Kansas City, Dec. 16,
1979

Not too many of you out there
remember this one, but it’s worth
mentioning.‘ 9

J The game was played on the
last day of the 1979 season at
Tampa Stadium in an absolutely
horrendous downpour. , Both
teams slid and slopped around
the quagmire that was the playing
ﬁeld for three hours until Tampa
Bay kicker Neil O’Donoghue
booted a 19-yard, FG midway
through the fourth quarter to give
the Buccaneers their ﬁrst NFC
Central title. _

“Oh, damn,” blurted the
frustrated Kansas City head coach,

ﬁg Marv Levy.

“After what we've gone
through, I'll take it any way I can
get it,” laughed an elated John
McKay, who guided the young
Buccaneers upward from their
dismal 0-26 inception through
1976-77 andeventually into the
1979 NFC Championship game.

The Fog Bowl, Chicago vs.
Philadelphia, Dec. 31, 1988

In this NFC divisional playoff,
the Bears and Eagles squared off
in picture-perfect weather; that
is, for the first 28 minutes of the
contest. But with about two
minutes to play in the opening
half, an ominous blanket of fog
slid off Lake Michigan and found

 a, comfortable resting place over J

Soldier Field. .

’ It was like something out of a
1957 horror ﬁlm. Vincent Price,
Raymond Burr and Ronald
Reagan star in "Thescaiy Stuﬂ
that swallowed up’ Soldier Field

and the Philly Eagles lilee Orson
Wells Gulping an HorsD’oeuvre. ”
Ooooh, it was a scary one,

kids.

The Bears built up a 17-9
halftime lead partially on the
strength of a 64-yard touchdown
pass from Mike Tomczak to
Dennis McKinnon that shocked
the Eagles. Then the skies
thickenedup and swallowedwhat
was left of the game. Philadelphia
quarterback I Randall
Cunningham, who was heard to
have been very impressive (27 of
54, 407 yards), was forced to play

second-half catchup ’wearing

literally a blindfold.
“It was something else,” said
Cunningham. “I’d completed one

earlier to Keith‘ Uackson, a tight _

end], then I looked for him again

and he'd completely

disappeared.” .

' Deﬁnitely a weird situation.
"‘The weirdest," said Chicago

defensive end Al J Harris. “One

time on the sideline I watched a

sweep start, then both teams 7

disappeared. I expected‘ to see
Sherlock Holmes come out of the
fog with his pipe and trench coat:
‘Watson, was that a sound’ I
heard?” ,

Yet one gentleman
downplayed the effect of the
playing conditions. “Oh, the Bears
beat us, not the fog,” growled
Eagles coach Buddy Ryan after
Chicago’s 20-12 win -

The Mud Bowl, Minnesota ‘

vs. Los Angeles, Dec. 26, 1977
Minnesota was traditionally

known for its unruly weather

conditions in the wintertime. So
when the Vikings and the L.A.
Rams met up in the Los Angeles

Coliseum in the 1977. NFC,

playoffs, Minnesota decided to
bring some of that snow with it to
LA, you know, a little bit of a
competitive advantage. 9
Well, when the snow via airmail
to sunny Los Angeles hit the
Hollywood heat, it melted, which

produced rain. And any of you

budding alchemists out there
remember from being a little kid
that that the equation H20 ji-

DIRT > MUD is still as sure
as the sun coming up each day.

The Vikes and Rams fought it
out in some of the best mud this
country has ever seen.

“The conditions were more
suited to us than to them,” smarted
Minnesota head coach Bud Grant.

“If you play on bad ﬁelds,
they’re going to get worse. We
wanted to throw early and get
any passing advantage we could,

because late inthe game it would -

be difficult to throw the ball. On
a good ﬁeld, a seven or 14-point

‘ lead isn’t very much, but on a bad

field it gets to be monumental.”

“You couldn’t get any footing,
let alone any pass rush,” said
Rams defensive lineman Jack
Youngblood. “You kinda slid your
way around the ﬁeld”, A

Although the Rams outgained
Minnesota in yardage, 279 to 201,
Los Angeles was hindered by
three interceptions by its
quarterback, Pat Haden.

“I didn’t execute atquarterback,
and consequently, our offense
didn’t move," said Haden in the
losers locker room. .

Viking quarterback Bob Lee,
subbing for’ the injured Fran
T arkenton, completed five of his
first five passes for 57 yards in the

team’s opening drive, which ate J‘ 9

up 70 yardsand ended on a 5-
yard touchdown run by Chuck
Foreman. I \

Lee never completed another
pass. He -never had to. in

He threw only three passes in
the second halfand called running
plays on all of the team’s last 25

' plays.

The Vikes held a 7-0 lead till
the fourth quarter, until halfback
Sammy -Johnson slopped over
from the 1—yard line to put the
game out of reach. A 1—yard toss
late in the game from Haden to
HaroldJackson set the ﬁnal at 14-
7. '

The footing wasn’t sure, but ,

one thing was: Minnesota was
one tough mudder. '

  Winand

Continued from page 8

Winand has competed in about
12 races this year, but hopes to
increase that number to 40' next
year.
_ “I've been training regularly to
do that. I run 11 miles a day, six
days out of the week, and on top
of that, I do hill work. By that I
mean [that] there’s a big hill near

where I live, steep enough so

that I can’t even get any miles per
hour and I climb that three or
four times a week, 12 times each
day,” Winand said.

Wheelchair racing popularity

. has increased each year, and next

year arace is scheduled in Seattle,

“Wheels of Fire,” especially

created for wheelchair athletes.
“It’s amazing how the

technology has affected the

industry. They now make three-
wheeled chairs and chairs made
out of titanium that weigh only

, seven to eight pounds,” Winand

said.

According to Winand, four-
wheeled chairs _ have
moreresistance, resulting in
slower speeds. Three—wheeled
chairs are also easier to turn and
are more stable.

“Sometimes in a four‘-wheeler,

the front two wheels ﬂy up, and ,

you’re riding on two wheels,”
Winand said.

A top—of-the—line wheelchair
can cost over $ 1,500 according to
Winand. A threeiwheeled,
custom-built frame goes for about
$1,200, two heavy-duty back
wheels cost another $300, then
there are accessories such as a

« interested

I not at what Ican’t do.”

speedometer and brakes, which
cost anywhere from $20 to $50.

Winand also said that prize
money for wheelchair entries has
increased over the yearsf

“There never used to be prize
money, but most races now
recognize wheelchair athletes; in
fact, at the “Wheels of Fire” race
in Seattle, first prize will be a
couple of thousand dollars,"
Winand said.

She received $450 for her Great
Race victory, far less than the
$4,000 prize for the top‘ runner;
however, there were signiﬁcantly
less wheelchair entries than
runners.

Any prize money Winand earns _

gets putright back into her sport
so that" she can imaintain an
amateur status. Winand is hoping
the Olympics continue to
schedule wheelchair events in

1992, in Barcelona, Spain.

“In 1984 at Los Angeles, they '

hada 1,500-meter event for men
and an 800—meter event for
women, and they had the same
thing in Seoul [in 1988], but I’m
not sure what they’re going to‘ do
for Barcelona.” Winand offers
just one piece of advice for anyone
who is physically disabled and is

athletics. _

“Just go ahead and do it. There
is more to life than just being a

spectator. It helped me when “I ~

didn’t want to be like this. I*;§ee
people a lot worse off than ‘fj-
and I look at what I can do,
