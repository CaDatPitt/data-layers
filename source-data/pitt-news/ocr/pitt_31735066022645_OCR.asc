Current office hours at the health
center are 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. Mon-
day through Friday, Eckley said.
The center is closed on weekends.

“Eight years ago, we were open
on weekends,” he said. However,
he added that the center.did not
receive many patients on weekends,

.and the results of a student survey
indicated that keeping the center
open on weekends .wasn’t
‘necessary. According to Eckley,
the center hasn’t gotten any com-
plaints about being closed on

weekends, ' . V .,

However, some Student Govern- - "
ment Board members said they have
received a few complaints about no
weekend service.

Gideon said the Wellness,’ 
Resource Center is open from 1l_-
p.m.~ Friday to 11 p.m. Sunday-to’
handle weekend emergencies. She i
added that students who have com-
plaints or problems about the
health center can come to the Stu-

with them. Gideon confirmed
Eckley’s statement and added that
the advisory -‘board “gives its full
support to the increase.”

Gideon said the Student Health
Advisory Board has been working
since September with the Student
Health Service and the administra‘-
tion.

“For the student health center to '
provide the same services they have
been providing in the past, an in-
crease in the health fee is needed,”
she said.

crease proposal, it will be sent to
Senior Vice-Chancellor Jack
Freeman, Chancellor Wesley
Posvar and the Board of Trustees
for approval, according to Eckley. .

country,” Eckley said.
‘ $30 and up a term.”

Eckley explained an increase is
needed because the center’s budget .
is more than its projected income.
He said the projected income for
_1979-80 is $522,016 and the 1979-80
budget is $688,957.

“We’re taking in less than we’re
spending,” he said.

Gary Houston, executive assis-
tant to the vice-chancellor for stu-
dent affairs, said the fee needs to be
raised because inflation and declin-
ing enrollments/have cut down on

' income. " T

Eckley said that the health center
has kept in direct contact with the
Student Health Advisory Board and
has shared all budget information

 UnIversify‘Senafe Hears Suggestions‘

~  From Oaklandlmprovemenf Group

’ March 25.

By JEFFREY S. GRUNEWALD
‘ Pitt News Staff Writer
. The University Senate held its
spring meeting Thursday and heard
a presentation by Jay Roling on the
progress being made by Oakland
Directions Inc. (ODI). ODI is cur-
rently working on recommenda-
tions to be made to the city on how
to improve the Oakland area.
Roling, assistant to the ._vice
chancellor for public affairs for
community relations, said that an
ODI survey released in 1978 showed
that the main areas of concern in ~
Oakland are: residential and com-
mercial deterioration, institutional
problems, traffic, and crime and
personal safety. He then showed
slides showing fixed areas of
development and some areas which
areavailable for development.
“Increases in owner occupied -

housing, new rental housing on
scattered sites, new shops and land-
scaping open areas are some ways
we’ve come up with to revitalize ex-
isting residential areas,” Roling
said.

One of the local residents’ major
problems—parking—was also con-
sidered. I '»

“Sticker parking for, local
residents has worked in other
cities,” he said. “Banning the use
of designated streets to all except '
residents with stickers could be en-_
forced. 'We would have to accept‘«
the fact, however, that parking for
those who commute would have to
be found.”

Traffic problems will be greatly
improved this ‘summer with the syn-
cronization of the traffic lights on
Fifth Avenue and the resurfacing of
Forbes Avenue, creating a “utopian

traffic system,” Roling said.

Roling also’ said that Meyran,
Bouquet, Oakland, and Atwood
Streets should be made one-way in
the opposite direction they now‘
run. He stressed that “anything
ODI comes up with is only a sugges-
tion to the city, though.”

_ In other Senate business,
Chancellor Wesley Posvar said that
the U.S. Department of Labor is
going to review the university’s
compliance with affirmative action
laws. He pointed out that this was
not unusual since the university
receives -federal funds.

Posvar also announced that the
speaker for convocation, April 27
at the Civic Arena, will be Secretary
of Education and Welfare Patricia
Roberts-Harris. _ C ,. -

Pitt and Duquesne University :
To Sponsor Symposiurh On Dante

By DEBBIE MARTIN
Pitt News Staff Writer

~ Is there humor in Hell? This
aspect of Dante’s Divine Comedy is
just one of the subjects to be
discussed at the Dante Symposium,
Sponsored by the
University of Pittsburgh and Du-
quesne University, the event is the
-third in a series and will be held at
Duquesne.

The symposium, aided by con-
tributions from the Community
College of Allegheny County and
Carnegie-Mellon University will be
an all-day affair, from 1:30 p.’m. to

9:30 p.m., featuring lectures and’
discussion by well-known authors
on the works of the poet Dante

‘Alighieri. Speakers will include Dr.

Glauco Carnbon from the Universi-
ty of Connecticut and Dr. Barbara
Sargent-Baur from Pitt. There will
also be Italian Renaissance and
Baroque music and a Dante exhibit. ‘
No knowledge of the Italian
language is necessary asthe entire.
symposium will be in English. And,
according to Pitt’s Dr. _Tibor

Wlassics, chairman of the organiz-
ing committee, one does not need to
have read or seen The Towering In-
ferno to appreciate Dante’s Infer-

no. « é ‘

“Dante’s ﬂame still burns,”
Wlassics said. He added that there
are about 100 partial or full trans-
lations of the Divine Comedy,
which is 700 years old.

“The Italians have introduced
many words into the English
language, but ‘ravioli’ and
‘spaghetti’ aren’t the whole story,”—
said Wlassics. “ “Inferno’ is
Dante’s worgl and he is a best-seller

_even today.” .

Admission to the symposium,
which begins ~ in the Duquesne.
Union Building, is free and open to
anyone.

Said Yeager, “We are trying to

 take a prudent stand.”

Response to these questions came
from Larry Lunsford, assistant
director of Student Activities and
media advisor.

The Carnegie-Mellon station,
WRCT, operates annually on
$13,000, funded by the student
government and Duquesne’s sta-
tion, WDUQ, operates on $200,000

_annually, $100,000 coming from the

‘*3-Jniversity funds and the remaining
from grants, gifts and outside agen-
cies.

The $15,000 a year for WPGH‘

would be provided by the Student

-‘WPGH FM Proposal  

Publications and Media Board, said
Lunsford. In 1979, the Student
Government Board endorsed the
proposal but there has been a
change in allocations.

“All allocations . for student
media have been turned over to the
Media Board,” explained
Lunsford.

The vMedia Board supports
WPGH and has agreed to allocate
funds for the proposed station, ac-
cording to a memo from the Office
of Student Activities.

The next step will be a meeting
between the Senior Vice Chancellor
for Administration’s Office and
representatives from WPGH.

    Truth «in

Page 4—Friday, March 21, 1980

The legislation also addresses the problems of 
students who take coaching courses from companies '
‘involved in this service. Many students cannot af-
ford the service. Those that can have an obvious ad-
vantage because they are prepared for the tests.

Standardized tests, those nerve-wracking examina-
tions we all had to take to prove our worth to Pitt’s
admissions office, may finally come under public
scrutiny if the proposed “truth in testing” legislation
is passed.

 

If the legislation is passed, those students who can-
not afford the coaching services can see the answers
to the tests after they take them and be prepared for

' the tests the next time around. .

Introduced in the State Senate by Senator James
R. Kelley, “truth in testing” legislation would re-
quire testing companies to publish answers to stan-
dardized tests after they are given.

Finally, opening up the standardized testing pro?
cess would be much fairer than the way the system
currently‘ operates.

The proposed legislation would be welcomed by
students-everywhere because of the weight given to
standardized test scores by college and university ad-

. missions officers. ‘ Many students’ futures ride on the results of stan-
~ dardized tests. Passage of the “truth in testing”
legislation would allow for better preparation,

The various components of the legislationlwould _
resulting in a more equitable system.

aid students in a number of ways.

Standardized testing services have had a free ride
for too long. They have not been and are still not an
open system where the public, particularly those peo-
ple who must take these tests, can examine their
operations. ' ' -

First, it would relieve the extreme anxiety caused
by the. tests after a student receives his/her score.
Thereis always that element of doubt as to whether
the testing company erred in scoring the tests. Under
the “truth in testing” legislation, students may see if
scoring errors were made. » ‘ The standardized test companies are subject to no
governmental control. The “truth in testing’-’ legisla-
tion will recognize these companies for what they are,
bigvbusinesses that affect the future of millions of
students in this country.

!"\

Mistakes by the company may affect the students
future concerning admission to an institution of
.f- _ . ‘ higher learning. '

Writer's Advocoﬁon of National Defense Includes Active Draft  

Otto von Bismark once stated,
“God has a special province for
drunkards, fools and the United
States of America.” What I’m

C _about to writehere won’t be very

popular perhaps, but I‘ console
myself in knowing that what I ad-
vocate would not likely to be

‘popular at any time in our history.
For I advocate an all-together na-'
‘ tional defense, which means under

current conditions, the draft. A

Not only registration, but an ac-
tive draft.

I've heard all the arguments‘

against the draft, and it’s my con-
sideration they are founded on a
grossly bad‘ grasp of political
science; fear, not healthy fear but
fear bordering on hysteria; and a
Nixon-like paranoia against unsee

‘national ‘enemies’. A

National resistence to the draft is
not new. The Civil War draft, as
we all know, was stoutly resisted at
times. Most politically signiﬁcant
nations, Western, Communist or
neutral, have a draft. But the U.S.,
Britain and Dominion countries do
not. This is not a coincidence, but
results from the Anglo-American

._ dislike of a standing army.

. We have; however, had a draft in
wartime. _Which brings me to the

'..>I'dr'; ."., ,. '.v ‘, 

first myth about the draft; the no-
tion of “Everytime we have a draft,
we have a war"’. Stating it this way
is putting the cart before the horse.
We had a draft in l9l7—after
W.W. I had been going for 3 years,
and most Americans advocated en.-
try. We revived the draft in -1940
and ’50—under similar cir-
cumstances. On the other hand,
Switzerland and Sweden have
universal conscription—and, partly
because nobody has gambled on
their unpreparedness, have not had
a war in 150 years. '

Another belief is the idea that “If
we have a draft, the military will be
tempted to go to war”, Pardon me,
but if I remember correctly, Con-
gress and the President, not the-
Pentagon, declare the wars, and we,
the voters, elect them.

Then there is the gross over-
simpliﬁcation “I don't want to
fight for ‘oil that isn't ours.” I
agree--we'shouldn’t take oil that
isn't offered us. But the

dependence of our nation on oil is a‘

fact. The stoppage of Mideast oil
would not only mean giving up
one’s Sunday drive, but probably
your financial aid and your job at
the end of college. In short, our
economy would be in disasterous

condition. And the effect on W.
Europe and Japan would be even
worse. I don’t take such a prospect
lightly. So'I don’t see any reason
why we shouldn’t raise morethan a
palid protest if the Soviet Union or
other power halts the legitimate sell-
ing of oil to the West from the
Mideast. Now I’m not saying we
don’t need tight conservation
measures. Or that I want World
War III any less than the most avid
protestor. But the preservation of
peace and the strength .of the
Western alliance require a vigorous
diplomatic effort, in which the
maintenance of military force is an
ingredient. And as the miscues of
the current administration
demonstrate, dipomatic efforts
backed by unpreparedness and
military vacilation are bound to

A fail.

Now The Pitt News has said f_‘it’s
too soon after Vietnam for ' a
draf .” , I don’t know where you
get this logic, or when the paper will
decide how much of the fog of time
has interposed. However, a million
and one things have occurred since
the Vietnam war, and I feel that it
makes more sense to attend to the
world of the here and now, rather
than to the one of ten years ago.

Almost any analysis will tell you
that if, God forbid, there is a third
world war, it may very well be
fought conventionally, in a quick
fight, and, most importantly, with
the armies on hand. Should—again

~God forbid——the Red Army and

NATO go at it in the near future, it
will be rather late for minds fixated
in the '60’s to make ‘the quantum
leap.

And we’ve all heard (too often)
those who statethat America is an
imperialist country, and the draft is I
only, to help the oil companies fight
the ‘next world war. I can’t say
much that will convince advocates
of this_viewpOint otherwise, except

that your arguments are shot with ’

inconsistencies (why are the oil
companies bothering with all this
preparation--why don’t they just
go ahead and seize Iranian fields
with the Marines? We could ..do it.)
Furthermore, the arguments ignore
the factor of the massive Soviet
arms increases of the past eighteen
years (or are they just
“defensive”—-that the. U.S.S.R.
despite Afghanistan, still faithfully
upholds “detente?”). Or must I
point out, for those of you who

think wars are money-making ven-
tures, that Vietnam is now seen as
an unmitigated economic disaster?

,No we're still asked by the

f‘capitalist America” viewpoint to
put our belief in the existence of

will-O’-the-wisp conspiracies, which '

has the rich corporatons placing
their own existence in jeopardy
along with everyone else’s for a few
extra dollars. Come on, give Exxon

credit for some brains, you don’t ’

have to think they have morals.
Finally, I believe many are join-
ing the anti-draft movement out of
sincere pacificism, a desire for ge-
nuine world peace. It would be a
nice thought that, despite all
history, to ‘the contrary, our
unilateral disarmament would bring
peace. It would be even better if
there were many more of the
pacifist mind, not only here but in
other countries; not only in the
streets but in high places. As for
myself, I recognize the existence of
the rest of the harsh world out
there, and feel we have too long
underplayed its realities.

l have been reading for some time
now a number of articles and letters
concerning the issue of the draft.
Many are arguing some fine
political points based on equal
rights: should 19-20-year—olds be
drafted or why men and not
women? It seems to me that most
everyonehas missed the point. The
arguments are all posited on the
belief that we have some political
crisis in the Persian Gulf that
somehow threatens the free world

Tand thus rocks the very foundations

illogical and feel compeled to point
to the rhetorical problem involved.
I suggest that there are two main
reasons why President Carter is call-
ing for the draft. The first reason is
economic, the second is political

and neither has anything to do with‘

the survival

democracy.
The economic problem is that we

have soaked the Middle East coun-

or dissolution of

tries for years in a deal that made
our nation rich and expanded and
entrenched their uper class——the
Shah et al. Our oil companies have
their investments literally sunk into
the Middle East. The stability of the
Middle East — whatever the form of
government, is the interest of the oil

. companies. Now if we want to be

honest with ourselves, we can say
that we need the draft to maintain

. the stability of our oil companies.

Or we could let them hire their own
army and march them into the Mid-

dle East with big orange disks on .
their helmets. Granted, it the oil ,

companies go under, we will be
down economically. And we may
have fewer dollars to spend. But,
don’t confuse dollars with
democracy. If the oil companies go
down, you may be dialing your vote
into a voting computer rather than
driving it -to a polling place.

The second reason behind Presi-

contend, is political but, again, has
nothing to do with democracy.’We
are now beginning to pay_the price
for years of lavish living on mid-
east oil profits. We will continue to
pay more. Whose fault is it that we
are, paying for thirty years of easy
living? The fault no more belongs
solely to President Carter than it
does to you and me. We as a nation
got greedy and took what we

This is where the political element

it to Jackie Sherrill to throw
another curve into the entire
episode. Sherrill surprised a group

Clancy, who was an all-State

At one time or another in most
athletes’ careers, there comes the
day when they must choose that one
sport to which they will devote all
of their time. For Pitt swimmer
Dale Pﬂaumer, that particular day
arrived “during his freshman season
at William Tennent Senior High
School in Southhampton, Pa.
Pflaumer chose swimming over
football, mainly because he had
been swimming since fifth grade.

“When I was 11, I had my first
swimming lessons,” said Pflaumer.
“My parents are really the ones res-

'ponsible for getting me started. We

had a summer house in Ocean City,
N.J., and I enjoyed swimming there
every summer. I liked swimming
over football because the competi-
tion was more of a one-to-one
basis. It was always you against the
person nextto you.” i

end, tackle and center.

Clancy’s decision to give football
a look leaves the basketball
coaching situation even more mud-
dled. Al coach is certain to think
twice about coming to "Pitt if he.
can’t be sure Clancy will be onthe
squad. Clancy, who will be a
senior, is undoubtedly the heart and

soul of the basketball team, and his “

possible absence because of the
overlapping football, and basketball
seasons, leaves Pitt woefully short
up front. ' -

This wouldn’t be the first time a

Pitt «-athlete played both football

and basketball. Back in the early
l96Os,CBrian Generalovich, one of
all-time leading
basketball scorers, gave up hoops

_his senior year to play football,
where he performed very 'well, ac-

cording to long time Pitt followers.

And during the mid 19703,
Robert Haygood doubled as Pitt’s
quarterback for a year and a half
under Johnny Majors, and as a

Sherlll looks ‘forward

During Pflaumer’s- sophomore

. year in high school, he set records in

the 200- and 500-meter freestyle
events, and just missed making it to’
the state championships. The next

' year though, Pflaumer didn’t miss.

He went on to states in those events,
and qualified once again .in his

‘senior year. Pﬂaumer was selected

team captain that year and con-
tinued to improve.

“My senior year was my best
year,” said Pﬂaumer. “My times
hadidropped and I could see myself
becoming a better swimmer.”

'The,turning point, however, in
Pflaumer’s career occurred when
he joined the Philadelphia Aquatic
Club after completing his junior
year.

“The PAC helped me more
than my high school team,” said
Pflaumer. “I swam there every day
of the year and didn’t always prac-
tice with the high school team.”

On the subject of football, Coach
Sherrill welcomes back '50 let-
termen, (including 16 starters) to his
1980 squad, which should be a
definite threat to win the national
championship.

Sherrill lists the major priorities
as finding an offensive tackle and
guard to fill the positions vacated
by Dan Fidler and Bob Gruber, and
overall improvement in the inside
running game. . v

In player position moves, Sherrill
announced that sophomore-to-be
Rich Kraynak is being switched
from defensive end to linebacker,
and in an important move, Rick
Trocano will be used at both
quarterback and free safety in the
spring. According to Sherrill, if

‘Trocano shows he is capable of

starting at safety, he will. If not, he
will be moved to his natural
quarterback position, where he will
relieve Dan Marino if need be.

Speaking of Marino, the young
quarterback is one of ﬁve Pitt
players the Sports Information Of-
fice is pushing for all-America. Also
being touted are: .Hugh Green,
Randy McMillan, Mark May and

NEW YORK—Except for a

National Invitation Tournament
credentials didn’t seem very
strong. I

The Cavaliers had, finished
fifth in the‘Atlantic Coast Con-
ference and lost seven of their
last 10 games. That’s not exactly
awe-inspiring, but freshman
center Ralph Sampson is, and so
the NIT invited Virginia to come

along for the ride in the nation’s
oldest post-season college
basketball tournament.

Well, Sampson and his team
did more than that. They weav-
ed their way through the /early
round regional games, advanced
to the semifinals in New York’s

-Madison Square Garden, then

captured the championship with
a 58-55 decision over Minnesota.
Wednesday night.

Their five NIT victories gave
the_Cavaliers a 24-10 season’s
record and a trophy to take
home. It seemed in the early
part of the season that they were
destined for some title, especial-
ly after winning 12 of their first
-13 games.

I “We thought, “Hey, we’re-
there,” recalled Coach Terry
Holland.

\ (Continued on page 8)

Being an active member of the
PAC payed off for Pﬂaumer in the
long run. After talking to several

teammates, he became interested in

attending Pitt.’

“I had friends who were going to
Pitt, and along with a scholarship
offer and wanting to get away from
Philly for a while, I decided to visit
there,” he said. “I noticed that
Coach Dick Bradshaw had gotten
winning seasons out of the team.
Pitt had improved and was looking
to be a powerhouse.

“I thought Pitt would be a good
choice for academic reasons,” he
added, “and along with having
good facilities and a swimming pro-
gram that was on the upswing,‘ my

mind was made up.

“My parents were behind me 100
percent, concerning my choice to
attend Pitt, which really helped.
They've always been behind me as
far as swimming went,” Pflaumer

said. "They have always tried to
help and give me confidence and
never criticized me for having any
bad times.” ‘

Now a senior, Pflaumer is ‘ap-
proaching his peak and has several
highpoints he can look back upon.

“Last year we had more depth,”
said Pﬂaumer. "This year, we took

Easternsand won with a tremen-
dous team effort. The team is
closer now than I’ve ever seen it.

‘Winning Easterns, after losing a

dual meet to WVU, is the best vic-
tory I’ve had here.”

During Pitt’s S28-meet winning
streak, Pflaumer went undefeated.
Against North Carolina this year,

By MARK NITOWSKI
P_itt News Staff Writer
Consider how difficult it would
be for Jackie Sherrill’s troops to

~win their opener ‘against Boston
~Co1lege September 13 without the

beneﬁt of a single scrimmage. What
chances would the Panthers have
against the Golden Eagles if they
never set foot outside of the

,,.Stadium or the Fieldhouse until

September 11? They’d probably
have two chances—slim and none.

I And slim just left town, right?

That’s the predicament Pitt head
coach Bobby Lewis and his 1980
Panther baseball team find
themselves in as they prepare foran

. opening doubleheader at Navy this

Saturday.
“Wednesday was our first day

H 7 outside,” said Lewis. “We took a

few rounds of infield and outfield.”

Making the task-even more for-
midable is the fact that the Panthers
will be leaving ‘early Monday morn-
ing for the 1980 Stetson University
-Deland Recreation Invitational
Baseball Tournament" in Florida.
Yes, the Panthers are going to
Florida,»but everything won’t be
sun fun and games _as Pitt will play
eight baseball games in .six days

_ ' against a few teams that have prob-
' ably been practicing outdoors for at
' least a month. The teams that will

diana University.

Lewis. ‘.‘Now I’m not sure what
kind of weather Indiana has had,
but I’m sure they’ve been outside,
too.” A V

‘This spring’s trip to Florida close-

ly resembles the Panthers’ jaunt to ‘

a similar tournament in California
in 1977. Just as they will be doing
this year, the Panthers arrived in
California with a minimal amount
of outdoor practice. However, sur-
prising the home folks more than
anyone else, the Panthers turned in
a very credible job throughout the
tourney. Lewis is banking on an
even better performance this time
around. ‘

“I_’d like to come out of this

tournament better than we did "in
California,” said Lewis. “I think
by the end of -the week, when we
have an opportunity to practice and
play, we'll show a’ great deal of im-
provement.” \ 

One big reason that the Panthers
may be able to pull themselves
together so quickly is the fact that
Lewis, along with assistant coach
Larry Wayman, have seven starters

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s volleyball team
had their win streak halted Wednes-
day evening when the Panthers were
defeated by cross-state rival Penn
State, 3 games to none, in the “ best
of five” match. Penn State, who is
currently considered to be the
number two team in the East,
behind _powerhouse Rutgers-
Newark, was able to hold the
match to its minimum three games.

Pitt came out very strong and
confident in the first game of the

irﬁmatch, but after a tough first game

defeat, 13-15, found it-hard to get
back into the form with which they
had started. The Panthers led in the
initial contest, 8-7, halfway through

_the game and continued to add
points to the score, leading by as
much as 12-9 at one point, and
looking as if they were going to take
full control of the match. But the
Nittany Lions fought back to within
one point of the Panthers, before
tying up the score at 12 points
apiece. The score remained tied at
13 until the Nittany Lions’ powerful
offense erupted to score two
straight points and win the hard
fought contest, 15-13.

  

 

   

The second game opened up with
the Panthers again taking the lead
4-2, a lead that they soon relin-
quished after a 4-4 tie. Penn State
took command 10 to 5 and con-
tinued the offensive surge until win-
ning the game, 15-7.

The third and decisive game of

Baseball Team

(Con tiriued from Page 8)

infield will be third baseman Chris
Mihalik, shortstop Mark Massa,
and firstsacker "Charlie Me/siano.
Mihalik batted .312 last season,
while Massa tied for the team lead’
in RBI’s and homeruns with 12 and
two respectively. He also averaged
a respectable .269 at the plate.

Adding strength to the Panther
infield will be sophomore Mike
Fitzpatrick and Scott Jenner, a
backup quarterback with the Pitt
football team for the past two
years.

“He’s (Jenner) very versatile. We
can use him to either back up Me-
siano at first or Mihalik at third,”
said Lewis. “And Fitzpatrick can
be used.at both short and second.

“A lot of that versatility has
given us time to work on our pit-

 
  
 

    
 
   
 
         
      

the match saw the Nittany Lions
successfulon a string of sets as they
outscored the Panthers 15-4. Penn
State build up that score from a 5-4
lead by holding the Panthers
scoreless from that point.

Pitt inserted Scott Robbins
throughout the entire match, which

ching more than our infield and
outfield,” he added.

According to Lewis, Pitt will also
be very ﬂexible behind the plate,
with any of three Panthers handling
the receiving chores.

“We’d like to get some good hit-
ting out of_ our catching,” said

- Lewis. “We’ll be rotating our cat-

chers, using Jim Pastin, Tim
Schwadron and Eric Reale. All of
‘them can do the job.” ~

Reale is the only freshman to
make the.Pitt ballclub.

In the outfield, Pitt will warmly.
welcome" the return of leftfielder
Rich Kline. Kline led the Panthers
with 21 hits and 8 doubles last
season, whileripping the ball at a
.323 clip. "

Incidentally, Kline should be

 

changed the offensive game a bit
from a 5-1.offense with only Dave
Baird setting to a 4-2, with both.
Baird and Robbings sharing the set-
ting responsibilities. Robbins was
substituted for Brian Devine, who
has been hampered by nagging in-
juries. Despite the injuries, Devine

Next to Kline, in centerﬁeld, will
be senior Mike Stevens. Stevens
had the second best average on -the
team last year batting .345. Besides
owning a shotgun for an arm, he is

‘also probably the Panthers’ best

baserunner, which is evident from
his team leading totals of 13 stolen-
bases and 16 runs scored.

Rounding out the outfield is
junior rightﬁelder Rick Fenoglietto,
who batted .271 in eleven games last
season.

On the mound, the Panthers
return their top two starters, senior
southpaw Don Koller and
sophomore Allen Lachowicz.
Koller posted a 4-1 record last year,
while Lachowicz was tops with a
1.50 ERA, giving up 6 earned runs
in 36 innings pitched. Filling out
the rest of a probable starting rota-

Overall, Lewis is mostly concern-
ed about raising last season's .284
‘team batting average.

“I think we’ll be strong defen- if

have to improve is hitting—more
consistent hitting. We left a lot of
