=RE~PENTING.
SPRESSED BY SPEAKER

 « need for repentance was the
substance of ‘delivered by Dr.

 McMillan, Ptcdbyteﬁan stu-

dent .pastor, at chapel-._service on

~Wednesday _at"‘Heinz ‘House.

* vstating that repentance is needed
at a’ "critical time,«and"tliat this is
3,1 very critical time, repentance
should ‘be the idea which is upper-

most in our minds. “._Repentance.”-

said.,Dr. McKinley, “makes us think
so 158 to change our minds. People,
as III, rule, do not~like to think. Thus
people are slowto regent. If. how-
ever, ,we.are truly re gious, our re-
ages alone. will make us repent,

' »'make us think so’ as to change
our mind. This power to think is
 brought about the triumph of
Christianity over paganism. The

_ S, , people not only outlived
fd‘ .out;_died the pagans, they cut-
%xht, them.‘ ’

Most” people, however, do not con-
any
quali of einotion in it._ “Em?}1on,”
aicco. ing to  Mcliinley, moti-
vates every action in'life. _
then, -is surely. emotional inasmuch
as it is the motivating-factor in hfe.
It‘ is as impossible to have action
without. friction‘ as it is to. have
ﬁriction without heat. RelIgIon_ Is
the heating factor which gives action
t;o,;:mOd,€1'n life. I ,

“'I‘here is more power in man s
hands than ever before,” stated Dr.
Mgminan, “and where_ _tliei'e is
power there is responsibility. and
where there is responsibility there
is need of repentance and power to
change our minds.”

' Dr. Percival H. Barker, pastonof
the Point Breeze Presbyterian
Church and one of the first _minI_s-
ters ever to broadcast by radio, will
deliver the last chapel talk of the
semester at Heinz house today at
12:30 o'clock. _

tor of the department of physical

quirements for students durin their

ation from the University.

versity who cannot swim be granted
the option of passing the swimming
test or attending a class in swim-
ming for a semester.

cused through the discretion of the
department of physical education.

Dressed in ragged clothes, the two
enthusiasts straggled on the basket-

game, and began a song and dance
act, and before they were through
the stadium crowd greeted them
with showers of pennies. In fact,
so plentifully did the coppers ﬂy
that the basketball players were
kept busy picking them up before
the start of the atter part of the
game. After giving an encore per-

Junior College

I. Thirty-two students of the Johns-'

 Junior College earn at leaist
enough money to pay all college ex-
penses,‘ arid a number earn living
expenses as well, it was determined
in a recent study of student em"-
ployment. Sixty students, or more

than forty percent of the entire en-
rollinent, have regular employment

outside of school hours. In "addi-

tion, about twenty others work in
vacation times, and at other seasons
when the opportunity ‘offers.
_ Of. those -who have regular em-
ployment, ’ 52 are men and '8 are
women. A great variety of positions
andpymany kinds of work are repre-
sented. '
—The men, among other things,
-clerk in stores of all kinds, own
newsstands
on‘ farms» or in factories, do car-
penter work, keep books, work in
garages d. filling stations, drive
elivery Aacks and private cars, ﬁt
shoes, work in railway shops, sell
ine_at,- write for newspapers, play in
a theater orchestra. One man is a
hotel‘ clerk-, one a clergyman, one a
draftsnian, one a chemist, one an
electrician in a theater, one runs an
insurance business, and one is an
interpreter. .
Among the girls, one keeps chil-
dren, one‘ writes magazine adver-
tisements, two keep books, one is a

_ pianist in a theater, one keeps house,

one clerks in a drugstore, and one
is a stenographer.

For the girls, the average num-
‘ber of hours of employment per
week is 22.’ Only three work more
than 80 hours per week. The great-
est number of hours worked by any
one girl is 48 per week.

For the men, the average number
of hours of employment per week
is 24. Two men work more than
60 hours per week, two work be-
tween 50 and 60 hours, four be-
tween 40' and 50, seven between’30
and 40; the rest work fewer hours
per week. . .

The work done by the sixty stu-
dents ap roximate the full-time
work‘ of out 32 workers. Most of
the students had the same positions
before entering school, so that other
workers have not been displaced by
the students.

The carrying of outside work does
not materially lower the scholarship
standing of the students, except in
a few cases. In fact, the average
grade of the students who are em-
ployed outside of school hours is
slightly better than the average
grade for the students who are not
employed. Apparently the serious
purpose of those who are employed
offset: the advantage held by those
who have full time for their studies.
However, all students who are em-
ployed do not carry a full schedule.-
~ It is ‘realized that the double load
must be a serious physical strain_in
many cases, and the college admin-
istration does not encourage students
to carry outside work. However,

so long as the class work is satis-

factory, and no serious detriment to
is noted, no objection is
I . . One advantage of the Junior
Co lege movement is that it enables
students to live at home, continue
part-time work, and ay their way

’ through the early co ege years in

just this way.

At a conservative estimate, stu-
dents working 20 hours per week
are able to pay all expense of school
-—tuition for a full course, labora-
tory -fees, and books. Those working
nuire than 20 hours per week are
paying part or all of their living
expenses as well as school expenses.’

Act 

I sits’

actors today and the people as a
whole do not know how to secure
good acting, in the opinion of Mr.
Edward H. Sothern, noted actor,
who was the subject of a radio
interview given last Thursday by
Dr. Louis K. Manley, dean of the

school of business administration.
The interview which was recently
secured by Dean Manley was broad-
cast over the University studio of
KDKA.

Interspersing varied comments _on
stage life as it exists today with
bits of past stage history and ob-
servations, Mr. Sothern in his
interview with Dean Manley recom-
mended the return of the stock thea-
tre and the establishment of mu-
nicipal theatres throughout the
country as a means of building up
the stage. “Brin back the stock
theeltre,” said r. Sothern.
“Through it we can acquaint our
children with the knowledge of great
plays. The fact that we are con-
scious of the inadequacy of the
present theatre means that even-
tually it will come back into the
larger values of an earlier day. A
defect recognized,is already partial-
ly corrected.”

Mr. Sothern as reported in the
interview by Dean Manley cited
France as a country in which the
municipal theatre has developed to
a great extent. Continuing his
comment upon a municipal theatre
of the European type, he said that
“if we could establish municipal
theatres, we could exhibit new and
successful’ plays as does the Come-
die Francaise. But as there would
constantly be in the repertoire the
best and noblest plays in the world.

“Europe has done the thing bet-
ter. There are 120 municipal thea-
tres in France, six of which are in
Paris. There are ninety-nine in
Germany and many in Russia, Scan-
dinavia and South America. The
expense is comparatively small: A
single theatre requires a subsidy of
about $50,000 a year. Managers
and actors are willing to accept
small but certain annual salaries
rather than large weekly salaries
zvhich, may be discontinued at any

ime.’ “

Today, the plight of the theatre »

is not the fault of the manager nor
can any of this group rescue it from
its present position, Mr. Sothern
believes. Furthermore, he holds
that if the theatre is rescued, “it
will be through the support of those
persons _of perception who see in

_ the municipal theatre the agency

for the schooling of actor and audi-
ence to a knowledge of ‘great parts
and with‘a subsidy, which, though
modest, will permit plays to be pro-
duced in which people will discover
the same spiritual ﬁneness that they
ﬁnd in great literature.

“We , are not creating many
great actors in America. Our
theatre does not have a policy
which provides the experience for
the creation of . great . actors. . A
theatre will "present a tragedy to-
day, then ._a comedy, and still later
a- revue. Some actors from abroad
visiting; the American stage, are of
supreme importance "because in
their» home lands they have had
long experience in great parts and
thus, like Booth, have grown up in
the tradition of the theatre.”

Vulgar eople will attend vulgar
plays whi e discriminating people
will contin to go to good plays,
said Mr. S em in the interview.

Mr. Sothern had much to say con-
cerning actors and acting, for he
"believes that playwright, producer
and audience, however important
they are in relation to the theatre,
must always remain secondary to
the actor himself. “The actor is
the theatre,” said ,Mr. Sothern, “and
if he is not, the theatre is merely
book-shelf. A

“One can learn to be a great
‘actor only throu h playing great
parts. In the ays when '~ great
parts were more commonly played
in America than is-the case now,

they were played before an edu- ,
heated audience,

That is, an audi-
ence educated to the theatre. The
modern audience is usually not
competent to form an opinion. It
has not known, inanygreat plays.
The public does not know what it
wants and if it did, it could ‘not se-
cure it. Managers are not to blame;
for the production ‘of great plays
frequentlyhas resiilted in a loss to
the producer.

“In addition the manager to-
day, for a Shakes earean perform-
ance, cannot roun out an entire
cast composed of actors of ability
and training Shakespearean parts.i’
Mr. Sothern thinks one reason
Shakespearean plays and the plays
of the old masters are in abeyance
assin of the stock theatre.
He believes, can Manley found,
interested in
the theatre as a social force and
an art——-a thing of beauty to be rec-
ognized as is painting, sculpture

and music-should re-establish the
stock theatre on an adequate ﬁnan-
cial basis.

Mr. Sothern was playing with his
father on the stage at the age of

twenty and now at the age of 68

his love for the theatre is just as
great as ever, Dean Manley found
actor.
He loves the theatre because as he
says, “to produce a great play and

put it worthily upon the stage in-

volves mo§t arts, many sciences
and nearly all that is artistic, poetic

and dramatic in the mind of man.”

Several weeks ago, Dean Manley
who is giving his impressions of
noted people, broadcast an interview

which he had with Dr. Stephen S.
Wise, rabbi of the Free Synagogue

of New York and acting president

of vthe Jewish institute of religion.

Asked whether in this generation

people are not at a rather low ebb
spiritually, Dr. Wise in the inter-
view, said:

“I do not think it quite fair to

say, answering such a question, .
that peo 1e are at a rather low ebb
spiritual y.
accurate to say that we are still
caught in the back-wash of the
war.
the war was almost as upsetting
spiritually as it was devastating

At ‘Pitt Sees, Little 4
Trouble for Women.

“No, I don’t see why a girl
shouldn't study to become an engi-
neer,” says the only girl engineer at
Pitt, Miss Marion Seiple, of New
Brighton. “But she must prepare
for a great deal of hard work.”

Since engineering is so entirely
new to any girl, she will naturally
ﬁnd it difficult; at least thisproved
to be true with herself, Miss Seiple
asserted. _

Never thinking of studying engi-
neering, the nearest Miss Seiple ever
came to entering this kind of work
was through her interest to become
a mathematics teacher. This was
her ambition as a little girl. Then,
three years ago, she entered the
Pittsburgh offices of a railroad ﬁrm
as a stenographer. Since she had
done well in the little mechanical
work she had dabbled in,_ she was
promoted to an engineering com-
puter, a position she still holds. In
this capacity she has worked for
seven months with the I. C. C. in
Washington and New York.

It was only her work in estimat-
ing and drafting that encouraged her
to take up mﬁianical and civil engi-
neering at the evening school of the
downtown division last year, and

  
       

'...e-iv  . {.

electrical engineering this year. Pre-
viously Miss Seiple had stud’ I
mathematics at the evening school. of
Geneva college, and next semestr
she hopes to study calculus _at Pitt
nightschool. After completing her
requirements for the bachelor's de-_
gree in civil engineering, Marion ex- 
pects to devote all her time to work
in the drafting room. _ 
Although there are only two other,
women in.the valuation department;
of the railroad, Miss Seiple has
never felt any resentment from the
men. “On the other hand,” she says.
“they have encouraged‘ me to study
and have shown a willingness to help
if I am in a difficulty.”
When asked whether she intended
to continue her profession if she
should marry, Miss Seiple didn’t
know what she would do. “I don’t..
know, though,’ why I shouldn't keep
up my work after marriage,” she
admitted. : _ »

FUTURE HAPPENINGS

Committee reports and plans for
future events were discussed at the
Y. W. C. A. cabinet meeting Mon-
day noon at Heinz house- _ l

Committee reports were _given on
the following, investigations: ﬁ-
nancial standing of the organization
at Pitt; excursion to the miners’
camps; and a discussion group to
be led by Dr. Albert E. Day, pas-

 

tor of the Christ Methodist Episco- -

-pal" Church. The first subject sug-
gested for the group was “The:
Controversy between Science and.
Religion.” _ I

Doris Sh-oop, chairman of the
meeting, announced that a tea will
be given February 14 at Heinz
house for freshman girls joining the
Y. W. C. A._ during the second
semester. The next event an-

nounced was the Pitt, Tech,,P. C. W. 
annual banquet to be held at the

Christ Methodist Episcopal‘ Church,
the date for which has not been
deﬁnitely announced. The meeting

was closed with a discussion con- _

cerning the rewordin of the pre-

. RIDAY we dove from the
plateau of sweetness and
light into A Yankee Paa-
sional (Boni .- & Liveright,
$2.50), by Samuel Ornitz, the
author of Haunch, Paunch, and
Jowl, which a few years ago
banged into prominence. Partly
responsible was the title; we
didn't know that ‘passional’ is
deﬁned as “a book of the suf-
ferings of saints and martyrs,
for reading on their festivals."
That break aside, however, in
we dove and came up at the end
of page three with a grimace.
Rough-hewn diction, a ﬁne play-
thing for moments of conscious
highbrowism, is usually too un-
comfortable for leisurely read-

books with “passional" titles.

precisely‘ in the manner of a

tiplied, as in etching or engrav-
ing.” Some, naturally, are bet-
ter than others. In practically
' all, however, the artist drama-
tlzes what is around him, often
catching it with such force that
it lives from the page. That
quality has made some call Bel-
lows an illustrator rather than
an artist. Does it matter? What
these lithographs tell» is that a

has succeeded in communicating
a large share of the interest.

FRITZ KREISLER
_ Tomorrow night the inimitable‘
Fritz Kreisler and his ﬁddle will be
here at Carnegie Hall. The sixth
Bach sonata and Mendelssohn’s E
Minor Concerto are the main num-
bers of his program. The remainder
of it is made up chiefly of his own
original compositions and arrange-
ments. There need be no comment
on Mr. Kreisler himself; but it is
lamentable, though, that with so
much ﬁne ﬁddle music extant, a mu-
sician of Mr. Kreisler’s ability
should give us such a- thin program.
It does not speak well for the listen-
lng ability of Pittsburgh's audiences,
to say the least. ‘

Whatever his weakness as a per-
fectly‘ developed artist may be,
Paul» Kochanski has a technique that
‘easily places him among the great-
est of present—day violin virtuosi.
_ , concert at the Syria Mosque]
week proved this to the delight
of an unusually enthusiastic‘ audi-
ence with his performance of most,
diﬁlcult compositions. V
‘ .Koch'anski’s program was ar-
ranged, perhaps, with a view to sen-
sational'eﬁ’ects, yet it was far from
the conventional concert procedure

‘oughly-_ inured. Instead of playing
tlrst for the critics and than — the
laymen, -he played for all from the.
start to ﬁnish, interspersing long.
involved works‘ with shorter selec-
tions, almost as he chose. He
changed hisselections several times

noimoements in a barely recogniza-
ble English. _ ’
A Although Kochanski played his
ﬁrst selection, the Bach Concerto.
almost without ﬂaw, it proved
rather uninteresting. As an en-
core, he gave the Praeludio of
’Bach’s Sixth Sonata, a sustained
pe etual motion. This he played’
wit almostsuperhuman speed and_
power. Four short ei hteenth cen-
tury melodies of--Frenc and Italian
composers‘, arranged by Kreisler,
followed. His rendition of the
Praeludium and Allegro, the ﬁnal
number of; this group, was note-
worthy again for thespeed achieved
in the _A.lleg7-o. Kochanski played
at all’ times without any useless and
affected’ mannerisms. .

Life dances with me in the early morning,
The blossoms kindle where her light feet tread,
“You have the gayest heart in all the kingdom,
You are my sister, and my love,” she said.

Dife wanders with me in the graves of summer,
Through ancient towns, serene in cums: glow,
The sudden rains are ripples of her laughter,
Her fair hands toss the white December snow.

Once on a windy afternoon in April

We passed before a vaulted Gothic door,

The sunlight filtered through the marble archway
And I beheld His Shadow on the floor.

But Life must never know that I have can Him,
She may not pause to grieve for my regrets,

“What have I done to you, my love, my sister,
Whose tears drop on than purple violate!”

Senior Needs Orientation,
Says Dean of Women

That a college senior is in greater
need of orientation courses than the
 freshman ‘is the belief of Miss

‘ Thyrsa Amos, dean of women, as
expressed in a discussion on the
“Art of Efficient Living,” last Sun-
(Ia at a meeting of the Oxford club.
, n Amos brought out many
. facts in

H periments in the art of living course
given this semester. “The meaning
; of ‘art of. living’,” Dean Amos
  stated, “is working on the materials
of every man’s own life. It is to
ﬁnd the value and proper application
‘ of these materials that this course
is ‘veil. Results show that the in-
to ectual is not what the college
student emphasizes in life.”

' The point of view Dean Amos
‘ took was that “if one wishes to be
above the average, and the average
person, according to Woodworth, is
g only fourteen years old mentally,
one must live above the decencies
of life, as the English say. If he
knows he can use these materials,
and has the will power to mould
' these into a better life, then he can
 do it. It is an inward vision that
enables an artist to give us visible
experiences of the most wonderful
kind. The trouble with most people
is that they want to be only decent
folks, and lapse into a lower scale
of matter and econovnics.”

Dean Amos pictured her concep-

   

tion of the art of living by citing.

GaIwortliy’s play new current in
New York as one which teaches that

the decent self cannot he escaped.

‘  conclusion, the speaker advised
~  people to_“rely on courage that does
_ not anticipate, nor that is blind, nor
 on the courage built up by self-con-
 xtrol and faith, but on courage that

ARRANGE COMMUTERS’
DANCE FOR FRIDAY

A “Commuters’ Dance” for Pitt
co-eds, the ﬁrst of its kind to be ar-
ranged on the Pitt campus, will be
held at Heinz house Friday during
drill hour, by the social committee
of W. S. G. A.

Co-eds who commute but who are
unable to attend like social affairs
sponsored by W. S. G. A., this plan
was devised to give commuters an
opportunity to meet other co-eds on
the campus. “For this reason W.
S. G. A. extends the invitation to
all women as a sort of get ac-
quainted affair,” stated Betty Clark,
Col. '29, chairman.

A feature of the dance will be the
appearance of Dick Skidmore’s or-
chestra. Novelties are promised in
various “mixer” dances and match-
ing of dance partners by lottery.

The committee in charge is Betty
Clark, chairman; Alice Cohen, Helen
Young, Dorothy Cameron, Ann Na-
thanson, Elvira Sutter, Betty Baker,
Bess Royce, Helen Sekey, Berneice
Greer, Elizabeth Fitch and Helen
Smillie.

DISCUSS EDUCATION
AIMS AT INSTITUTE

General aims of education were
subjects of discussions by Professor
Roswell Johnson, head of the depart-
ment of oil and gas production, and
D11’; Glroger  Alderman, ggan of the
sc oo o e ucation, in a resses at
Trinity court institute last week.
Professor Johnson spoke on “The
Fallac of Human -Equality,” and
Dr. A derman discussed “Education
and Preparation for Life.”

Evidence for believing that there
is wide variation in the mental ca-
pacity of men, was given by Pro-
fessor Johnson, in his talk. Profes-
sor Johnson criticised the recent re-
sults in education which show a cor-
relation between the quality of
home and adopted children on the
ground that superior homes on the
average produce more selected chil-
dren. He contended that since it is
well known that the brain is varia-
ble, there is no reason to expect the
brain function to be constant.

The applications of mental varia-
tion in politics, education, the per-
sonal movement and eugenics, were
discussed by Prof. Johnson on
Wednesday.

Education, according to Professor
Johnson, should be variable
length and kind with regard to the
pature olftthe lI(l1(IlVld11al. Sectignifng

or quai y an earnest searc or
the very capableyouth for whom ed-
ucation should be furnished, should
be made, said the speaker. Further-
more, there should be selective en-
trance on such a basis as is used
at Antioch College. This plan also
includes a graded ‘tuition fee, indi-
viduals of the best capacity and at-
tainment paying no tuition, while a

gradual increase in tuition should be ’

made until those who are barely ad-
missible pay the entire cost. “This
scheme of education,” said Professor
Johnson, “cannot be condemned as
undemocratic, if we deﬁne democra-
cy, as _we should, as an equal con-
sideration for the determination of
capacity and appropriate opportuni-
ty commensurate with capacity}!

: In speaking of -the personaI',move-
ment, Professor Johnson said that
the employer should give more at-
tention to the importance of the bet-
ter methods in selection and promo-
tion of employees. “Pull," favor-
itism and nepotism should be con-
demned strongly by.public opinion
in private and public employment,
he said.

The speaker held that United
States should extend the quota re-
quirement of. the immigration act to
North and South America. Eventu-
ally the immigration arestriction
method should be based on the rule
of no_ immigration except by those
superior_ to the average‘ American.
Advocating the segregation of cer-
tain undesirables, the speaker urges
the support of a million dollar bond
issue of the state to be voted on at
the next election. In connection
with eugenics,_ Professor Johnson
held that marriage should, be more
selective by the requirement of de-
lay _and publicity after the regis-
tration of intent. Eventually, he be-
lieved that certiﬁcation by compe-
tent measures should also be re-
quired. A new ethics of reproduc-
tion is needed, placing emphasis on
adequacy of reproduction._ The
celibacy o_f superiors is in his opin-
ion unetlucal.

“ Dr. Alderman in his address on

Education and Preparation of Life"
pointed out that the present world
is undergoing a_ rapid change, both
externally and internally, illustrat-
in the external éhange from the
ﬁe  of communication and transpor-
tation. The internal change has
been mental, the child no longer
merely asks “what” but “why”; the
change has effected a change of
ideals and morals, and comparisons
are now of little value. '

Commemoration of Charter Day
the_date_ marking the founding of the
University, with a series of activi-
ties instead of the customary assem-
bly has found favor of campus au-
thorities.

Speaking of the suggested pro-
gram for the day including an as-
sembly dance and pilgramage to the
site of early University buildings,
Chancellor John "G. ‘Bowman said,
“It’s ﬁne; I'm for it.” Charter" day,
he stated, as observed at the pres-
ent time, is the‘ natural result of
existing conditions. Q Lack of space
and the consequent lack of associa--
tion of student with student and
student with teacher have led to in-'
difference in revering the history of
the Alma Miter. When the Ca-
thedral is finished, opportunity for
closer friendships and also for in-
dividual thought will follow, the
Chancellor believes. In turn, there.
will _grow up a loyalty to the Uni-
versity which will include a. respect
for Pitt tradition and a desire to“
know her history.

That a commemoration of Char-
ter Day must gradually was
expressed by Miss llen Geyer, as- 7
sistant professor of‘ English. “You‘
can't say: Now we're going to have‘
a tradition,” ‘Miss Geyer said.‘ “If
a good speaker were invited to as-
sembly, and if a real effort were
made by students, faculty and trus-
tees to attend the mass meeting,
Charter day would become edifying
to the University." Celebrating the
occasion with a holiday and dance
would be equal to continuing Pitt
Week with another name, believes
Miss Geyer.

Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women, thinks that Charter Day

   

should not be a day free from

IN deciding upon 1 business to follow, college men are likely
to be unduly inﬂuenced by theii observations or the suc-

But that is not a sound method of deciding for or against I
line of business to follow Instead, study the nature of the
business, its. relative importance in the economic  _
and its requirements Then consider how it fits your own in-
clinations and abilities. '

classes. “Charter Day,” said Miss

Amos, “should be a day full of rev-
erence for the founding of a. great
institution." Carnegie Institute is a
long way ahead in its Founder's Day
observances. Pitt should invite a
nationally known speaker for Char-
ter Day. Miss Amos suggests mark-
ing the’ site of the nrst home of the
University, in the downtown center;
and, to close the day, dinners and
dances of alumni and undergradu-
ates in. their various social groups
should be held.

Student relations committee of
Student Council has suggested. a
huge quadrennial ball.

Agreeing that Charter‘Day should
have a deeper signiﬁcance, Harold
Johnston, Med. '31, chairman of the
committee, admitted that a holiday
in honor of the occasion would soon
lead to authorities’ ruling out of
Charter Day as was the case with
Pitt Week. “But I think the idea
of a big dance at the close of Char-
ter Day would be ‘ritzy'," he said.

passed steadily on with each succeeding

GROWTH—-DR. POWELL

“The constitution of the United

' States was not made to be rigid, but

was constructed to give our coun-
tI_' room for a widespread and am-
ple growth, which we have been
witnessing for the past hundred
years,” stated Dr. Thomas Reed
Powell, professor of constitutional
law at Harvard law school, in a lec-
ture sponsored by the social sci-
ence seminar in Heinz house last
week. »

In opening his lecture, Dr. Pow-
ell comniented favorably on the
recent interest shown by A American
citizens in the constitution, especial-
ly by the oratorical contests con-

constitution has been inﬂuenced
very greatly by our fear of the
“Red-_ menace” over in Russia. Com-
menting upon this fact, he said that
the idea of having aliens in our
_count _has led us to interest them
in the istory and importance of the

Discussing the actual functions of
the supreme court, Dr. Powell em-
phasized the fact that the «opera-
tiul'l.S of this bod are purely s n-
taneoiis rather t an mechanic , as
most people would think. To illus-
trate‘ this = point, he cited the work
of John Marshall, first chief justice
of -the‘-‘supreme court. Discussing
Marshalland his . judicial contem-
poraries, Dr._ Powell praised. these
men for ‘ their. constructive organi-

zation and their work in establish-

in the federal judicial system.
The -“due process. clause” .' of ‘thea

. fourteenth amendment andthe-ﬁfth

amendment are the two most trouble-.
some -parts of the constitution for
judges to ' interpret,’ stated Dr.
Powell. f‘Tlie- main reason for this
is,” he said, “the wide scope and tre-
mendous field that both these amend-

ments cover-.”’ . I . . 

' In conclusion, Dr. Powellistressed
the pointthat any judge on the su-
preme court bench" is liable to make
amistake in giving a-decision. He
.Ju. es
usually differ on the interpretation.

of thepracticalities of thelaw. This

reme court ju es are only human

PURPOSE. PROCEDURE  
PROGRAM AT MEETING

Adoption of a purpose and .pro-
grain of rocedure together with
election 0 -administrative officers

an organization meeting of the Lib-
eral"cl_ub held Friday‘ afternoon in

To investigate and discuss open-.
miiidedly . pressing social problems
was adopted as the purpose of the
club, upon the recommendation of
the club ‘executive’ committee con-
sisting of Helen Cashdollar, Col. ’28;
Irene Ravitch, Col. '29, and Joseph
Lev’i—ne, Col. '30 and Herman Recht,
Ed. '28. Following the adoptionof
purpose and the election of officers,
two methods for conducting the pro-
gram of the organization, as sug-
gested by the committee, were dis-
cussed.

A majority vote of the members
favored a; plan both, for discussion
and research work by students who
will report? their investigations of
subjects to the club. If possible
along with the subject of discussion,
the club will conduct special prac-
tical trips‘ that will be open to all
students. Other methods of proced-
ure” suggested’ by the committee and
considered by ‘members -was one
which would consist -entirely of dis-
‘cussion. Speakers would give facts
of both sides ofquestions to the
organization, after which research
by individual effort would be made.

The present. mining situation has
been chosen as the _ﬁ_i-st subject -for
investigation. The club ‘has’ signi-
ﬁed its intention of concentrating on
this problem for the present, in-
stead of ‘having individual groups
investigate various questions and re-
port to the club. Picketing, possi-
bilities for a ‘settlement, and the

economic basis of the present strike

are phases of the"‘”question that will
be studied..- .  S . . _ 3

That June is the most popular
month for marriages, that the ages

cent of American women in this
district marry foreign-born men
are facts revealed in an analysis of
marriage licenses issued in the

present time made by Dr. John
Higson Cover, director of the Pitt
bureau of business research.

The research reveals that. as
business improves, the number of
licenses increase and as business
depression sets in, there is a rapid
drop in the number of licenses is-
sued. Prior to 1900, such changes
were gradual and the period between
low points longer, approximating
in one instance eight years. Since
1900, periods between low points
have shortened to from three to
four years, Dr. Cover found.

The ages 21 to 29 are the most
popular for both men and women.

men receiving licenses ‘ and seventy-
eight per cent of the women were in
this group. Fifteen per cent of the
women, but onl three per cent of
the men were etween 18 and 21.
Twenty-one per cent of men and
eleven per cent of women were from

parts to discover the popular time

the most popular month in the ﬁrst

group, with June first and Septem-

ber second in the last two groups.
