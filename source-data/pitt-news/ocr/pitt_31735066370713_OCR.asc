Hospitals debate pros and cons
” of second transplant center  

By llona Segedy
Staff Writer

The Presbyterian University Hos-
pital and Allegheny General Hospi-
tal are currently at odds over
whether a second kidney transplant
center is necessary_ in the Pittsburgh
area.

Presbyterian Hospital, whose
transplant surgery and support ser-
vices have received worldwide
recognition, opposes such a center.
Doctors there have been transplant-
ing kidneys for more than 10 years
under the direction of Chief of Urol-
ogy Dr. Thomas R. Hakala. Since
I980, 71] kidneys have been
transplanted. .

According to a Pittsburgh Press
article on Aug. 29, Dan Stickler,
president and chief executive officer
of Presbyterian Hospital, said, “We
think we’ve developed a strong com-
munity resource. We would not like

to see that diluted by the introduc-
tion of other programs.” '

Hospital spokesman -Tom Cha-
kurda also expressed that there is no
need for another kidney transplant
center. Summarizing the .-hospital’s
position, he said, “This region is best
served by Presby for both medical
and economic reasons.”

The two issues of this debate are
cost and advisablilty of using living
relatives as donors. Presbyterian
Hospital’s average total cost of a
transplant is reported at $25,000,
while Allegheny General’s-is $36,000
per case. Furthermore, Allegheny
General encourages a living-relative
donor system, an established medi-
cal practice as long as consent is
given. Presbyterian Hospital has not
conducted a living-donor transplant
in three years.

Allegheny General Hospital’s
position is that in using living rela-
tives as donors, the supply of availa-
ble organs would increase. In the

Aug. 27‘issue of The Pittsburgh
Press, Sigo Falk, associate director

for the Health Systems "Agency of ‘

Southwestern Pennsylvania, said
that there is a one-and-a-half to two
year backlog for kidney transplants.

Weighing the costs and benefits of
having two renal transplant centers,
the Health Systems Agency voted
3-1 on Aug. 26 against the Allegheny
General transplant center, with four
abstentions. But the center will be
able to argue for its plan before two
more HSA review panels on Sept. I2
and Sept.‘ l9.

Ian Rawson, vice president of
Allegheny General Hospital, in an
Aug. 29 Pittsburgh Pressinterview,
remained’optimistic. Rawson said,
“It’s not a question of tfAllegheny
will provide transplants, but when . I
think gradually the community will
become more and more aware that
more effort is needed.” I

Tel Aviv campus:

receive Pitt

By Dirk Kaufman S
Staff Writer

Among the advantages and bene-
ﬁts of the university experience is the
broadening of intellectual horizons.
Here at the University of Pittsburgh,
students are afforded the opportun-
ity of exploring intellectual and geo-
graphical horizons of truly global
proportions.

Through the assistance of the
Study Abroad Office and its acting
director, Cynthia Weinman, stu-
dents can spend a year of academia

receiving credit toward graduation -

at Pitt while studying at a university
halfway across the world.

The most recent addition to the
list of Pitt—afﬁliated schools is Tel
Aviv University in Israel.

“We are hoping to broaden the
perspectives of many students and to
give them an academically viable as
well as social and extra-curricular
opportunity,” said Bluma Stoler,
director of student programs in
North America for Tel Aviv Univer-
sity. “This program is designed spe-
cifically to permit American
students. It’s taught in English by
_members of the faculty of TAU. The
courses are geared toward Middle
Eastern studies and Israel-related
studies so that a student will be tak-
ing courses they probably couldn’t
take here or wouldn’t think of_taking
here,” she said. ~

Any interested student may apply
for study abroad, though one is eligi-
ble only up to.the first’ semester of
the senior year. Two students are
already in the program, and Stoler
said she hopes the number of stu-

dents who take part will increase.’

with each year. “Obviously, .the
more qualified‘ students that are
accepted and can go, the happier
Pitt will be and we will be,” she said.

According to Stoler, the Overseas

Students go abroad,

credits

Study Program at TAU has been in
existence for about 15 years. In the
past, students at Pitt would come to
TAU without any assistance from
the home university. “It makes a dif-
ference in terms of the credit alloca-
tion, and closer communicationﬁand
coordination with the Study Abroad
office,” she said. “Students won’t
just disappear (for a year). '
“It means doing the right things

one should do before going abroad. ,

Pre-approval by the department
[under which the student is study-
ing], doing a tentative schedule of
courses and making sure everything
is accredited properly.”

Stoler said that TAU is presently

affiliated with about 20 other uni-«

versites in, America along with
hundreds of other American.stu-
dents who attend on an. individ.ual
basis. This allows a student from a

. university such as Pitt to spend time
not only with Israeli students but I

also with others from universities all
across America. She added that
though the program is a large one,
students still receive individual
attention. “The program is small
enough to be very personal sothat
no one’s a number and no one is a
file somewhere. We know our stu-
dents; we enjoy having them.” .

A student at Pitt has many
options in simply staying on cam-
pus. Why would one choose to
attend school in another country? 

“Once you’re out of school, it’s
hard to take six months to a year and
travel abroad,” said Stoler, “and
although we would like to think we
could do it, very few of us have, time
to take advantage of the experience.

To live in a different culture — ina V

different world — is a very impor-
tant experience. We’re hoping that,
with this agreement, students and
their parents will be encouraged to
see Israel as a good place to visit."

Fazio faces student fans at post-game meeti

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer

The Foge Fazio Monday Morn-
ing Quarterback Club met for the
first time this week, and despite poor
attendance, the meeting seemed to
be successful, according to Pitt foot-
ball head coach Foge Fazio.

“I didn’t care about a big or small
crowd,” said Fazio. “ljust wanted to
have fun, and I did. And besides, it’s
still the first week, and once the
word gets out there should be a bet-
ter turnout.”

The session was - very informal.
Fazio and two football players,jun-
ior offensive tackle Randy Dixon
and senior center Barry Pettyjohn
candidly answered questions asked

' by the audience.

Most of the questioning centered
around the upcoming game against
the Ohio State Buckeyes at Colum-
bus, but there were also questions
about the victory over Purdue and
even one about the new football
jerseys—the ones without the names

;_,of_ theplayers on the back.

 
 

Fazio commented that the injury
to Ohio State’s Heisman Trophy
candidate running back Keith
Byars, would definitely hurt the
Buckeyes but would also cause the
Panthers some trouble.

“With Byars in there they would
use a one-back offense like they use
with the Washington Redskins and
John Riggins, and we could almost
guarantee seeing Byars run the foot-
ball 40 times,”said Fazio. “With him
out ofthere, We’re not real sure what
they're going to do.”

Fazio also took time out to
applaud the crowd that attended the
Purdue game.

“I was quite pleased with the
Purdue game and the way the crowd
reacted,” Fazio said. ‘‘It was the
most enthusiastic crowd at Pitt Sta-
dium that I can ever remember, and
they were behind us throughout the
whole game. I can’t tell them how
much theirsupport means to us.”

Pettyjohn and Dixon also fielded
questions and stressed the impor-
tance of this Saturday’s football
game. V _ L I

protest decision

(UPI) — Many angry New York
City parents are keeping children
out of school for a second day as
they protest a decision by city offi-
cials to let a 7-year-old child suffer-
ing from AIDS attend school. The
protest in the borough of Queens has
left half-empty classrooms in at least
six schools. Yesterday’s boycott
involved about 18,000 students. The
walkout. is centered in the Queens
area and does not involve other sec-
tions of the city.

  Berra testiﬁes

(UPI) — New York Yankee
infielder Dale Berra, testifying in a
federal drug trial in Pittsburgh yes-
terday, said that baseball stars Bill
Madlock and Willie Stargel pro-
vided him with “uppers” (amphe-
tamines) while all three played for
the Pirates.

Berra made the statement during
cross-examination in the trial of
Curtis Strong, who is charged with
selling drugs to baseball players.

Earlier in the trial, Berra told how
he bought cocaine from Strong in
1980 while fellow players and

coaches partied in an adjacent hotel

in the Pirate clubhouse in I982 and
said he was warned by manager
Chuck Tanner, “Don’t talk to that
gentleman. ”

Dravo awarded

(UPI) — Pittsburgh-based Dravo
Corporation announced yesterday
that it has received an award from
Inland Steel Company for engineer-
ing, procurement, construction and
start-up services on an RH-OB
vacuum degassing steel refining
facility.

The steel refining facility will be
located at Inland’s Indiana Harbor
Works steel mill in East Chicago,
lnd., as part of the firm’s No. 4 basic
oxygen furnace-shop operation.
Completion of the project is
expected in December 1986.

Another hurricane

(UPI) e With winds up to 170
miles an hour, Hurricane Rick is
slowly bearing away from Hawaii.
The National Weather Service says
the hurricane was 750 miles east of
Hilo on the island of Hawaii and
moving toward the northwest. Offi-
cials say the storm appears to be
slowly weakening. Its projected path

would keep it well east ofthe islands.

(UPI) — Five men and three
women were locked up in a room in
the West German Embassy in
Johannesburg yesterday. The envi-
ronmentalist, anti-nuclear Greens
party members plan to remain inside
the embassy for 48 hours to protest
Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s govern-
ment support for South Africa’s
white minority government. As of
yesterday, the eight have made no
attempt to interfere with normal
political business.

Meanwhile, South African bishop
Desmond Tutu says that President
Reagan’s order of limited economic
sanctions against the Pretoria
government’s racial policies is
“nothing but a slap on the wrist-.”

Comet’s tail
explored

(UPI) — Halley’s comet isn’t the
only celestial entity getting some
attention this year. A small Ameri-
can robot spacecraft is racing at 46-
thousand miles an hour toward the
Giacobini-Zinner comet. The comet
is 44-million miles from earth. The
probe, the International Cometary
Explorer, was expected to slice into

National unity

(UPI) —- In a nationally televised
address, Thailand’s prime minister
has called for national unity follow-
ing the l6th coup attempt in the
nation’s modern history. A state of
emergency remains in effect in Bang-
kok after loyalist troops put down
the 10-hour takeover attempt Mon-
day. Five people died and 59 were
wounded. An air of normalcy has
returned to Bangkok, with govern-
ment offices and shops open again.

Prisoners freed

(UPI) — Israel freed the last
group of hundreds of Lebanese
Shiite Moslem prisoners it had been
holding since its troops withdrew
from Lebanon in June. An Israeli
defense force spokesman is denying
reports that Israel holds any more
detainees. Earlier reports said Israel
would detain three prisoners. This
morning I99 prisoners were
released, and the Shiite Amal militia
had promised to release three kid-
napped Frenchmen in return.

NEW YORK (UPI) — Veteran
golfer Rod Funseth died yesterday at
the age of 52 in California after a
long battle with lung cancer. The
Spokane, Wash., native joined by
PGA tour full-time in I962. During
his 19-year career, he won the I965
Phoenix Open, the 1972 Glen
Campbell Open and the 1973
Greater Hartford Open. In I978, he
tied for second place in the Masters.
He left the tour after the 1980 season

with career earnin_gs of more than

$646,000. Funseth then joined the
Senior Tour, and in 1983 — despite
his advancing disease — won the
Legends of Golf title, teaming with
Roberto DeVicenczo.

(UPI) — Pittsburgh Steeler quar- -

terback Mark Malone has been
named American Football Confer-

ence Offensive Player of the Week.

Malone accounted for all six Steeler
touchdowns in Pittsburgh's 45-3
opening-game victory Sunday over
the Indianapolis Colts, passing for
five touchdowns and adding a sixth
on a quarterback sneak. He com-
pleted 21 passes for 287 yards and set
personal single-game highs for com-
pletions, yards and touchdown
passes.

Steeler wide receiver Louis Lipps
leads the AFC in touchdowns with
three and has morereceptions than
any other wide receiver, having
scored nine. '

As a team, the Steelers are third in
total offense and first in defense in
the AFC. They have scored the
second most points in the NFL.

(UPI) —The Pittsburgh Penguins
yesterday acquired center David
Simpson from the New York Island-

ers for future considerations. Simp-
son, 23, was an Islander third-round
draft choice in 1980 from the Lon-
don Knights Hockey League. He
was the 1982 Canadian Major Jun-
ior Hockey Player of the Year.
Simpson played two seasons in
New York’s minor league system
and sat out most of the last year after
the conditional trade that sent him

.to the Vancouver Canucks was

voided by HGL president John
Ziegler. Simpson scored one goal
and five assists in 10 games for the
Canadian National Team last
season.

The Penguins signed Simpson’s
brother, Craig, last week. Craig
Simpson was Pittsburgh’s first-
round choice in the I985 NHL entry
draft and the second player taken
overall after he was rated the best
player available by NHL central
scouting.

AIDS Scare

The recent action by parents ofschool childrenin New York City
make it clear that the AIDS issue has done more to strike fear into the
hearts of decent Americans than either diabolical Doctor Doom or

the evil Soviet Empire. In the borough of Queens, more than 10,000 I

children were kept home from school on Monday, Sept. 9, as parents
protested the decision by New York City school officials to allow a
second’ grade student afﬂicted with AIDS to attend classes. This

boycott, in the great American reactionary tradition, smacks of the "

kind of ignorance and intolerance characterized by such misguided
historical events as the Salem witch trials, the Red Scare and the
persecution of Vanessa Williams.

Admittedly, the AIDS ‘-‘epidemic” is cause for concern and even
alarm. However, does this decision warrant mass hysteria and panic?
I think not. Rather than ostracizing this and other unfortunate
victims, 1 think a case can be made for displaying compassion and
understanding.

Certainly much remains unknown about the AIDS virus. But
researchers are nearly certain that it cannot be communicated
through casual contact. Thus, if an AIDS victim sneezeson you, this
may cause you to catch a cold, but there is no proof that this would
infect you with the dreaded AIDS virus. No, as far as researchers can
determine, AIDS can be contacted in only one of three ways. And, to
my knowledge, neither sexual promiscuity nor intravenous drug use
are prevalent among second graders. Nor is it common for them to
administer blood’ transfusions to each other. '

I’ll go out on a limb and state unequivovally that the AIDS virus
cannot be transmitted through engaging in such activities as eraser-
tag, dodge-ball or spelling-bees. Neither is there any imminent
danger to students from the sharing of reading primers. So, why the
panic?

It seems to me that the kinds of exclusionary policies advocated by
these concerned parents will prevent nothing and only serve to add to
the already immense suffering ofany individual afflicted with AIDS.
Perhaps their time could be better spent soliciting money for
researching the AIDS virus, rather than persecuting an innocent

. victim.

I think Pitt's a really good school,
and I don't want to sound like too
much of a downer, especially after
the warm welcome of all the fresh-
man events. But there are a few very
important things you should know
about living here so you don’t wind
up getting really hurt, especially if
this is your first time at college, or
maybe your first time in a big city.

One danger that I hope to alert
you to right away is the very real
danger of the counter-ﬂow bus lane
right through the campus, down
Fifth Avenue. It won’t take you long
to see that, just from the way it’s set
up, people often step right into the
bus lane without seeing a bus com-
ing up behind them. The lane gives
the illusion of looking like‘it‘s safe,
like no traffic is coming, but three
kids were seriously hurt in the first
three weeks of school last year. And
believe me, it won't be long before

right out in front of an unstoppable
bus, or you catch yourself inches
from being crushed, if the bus driver

.is quick enough to find the horn. It’s

everybody, it’s not just the kids; one
of the secretaries from the Cathedral
of Learning was killed on the bus
lane. Seeing a close call can stop
your heart for a while; being in abus
lane accident probably would stop it
for good.

Crossing the street at Pitt in gen-
eral can be at best stressful and at
worst senselessly and inexcusably
dangerous. You know what Pitt has?
I couldn’t believe this, Pitt just put
up a school-children crossing sign
this summer, you know, with sil-
houettes of a little boy and girl hold-
ing schoolbooks. Let’s be real, guys.
I mean, it matters little that the sign
is on a sidewalk in the middle of the
Cathedral lawn. I don’t know who

’ the sign was meant to protect, but it

is a very typical official Pitt response
to a serious problem — very silly.
The other thing, maybe the main
thing, is to use your head and your
good sense when you are walking
around Oakland at night. You may
never have run into a mugger — so
you may never think about it — until
it happens. Don’t go walking at
night alone,.not to your car, not to a
classroom somewhere. The police

- explain that while incidents occur all

over the city, the main lighted streets
along Forbes are relatively safe, but
up around the buildings, around
Trees I-Iall, around “the Hill" and
towards Shadyside, that's where
muggings, assaults and rapes occur
every week.

Don '1 walk down an empty street
alone or even with just another per-
son. Nobody ever bothered me at
Pitt, then last Saturday night, I
broke a lot of the rules. I was walk-
ing down the hill to my bus stop
from my job up in Salk I-Iall; it was
dark and rainy, and there was no one
else around on Darraugh. I should
have been more careful, but I
wanted to catch the late bus. Two
guys tried to mug me. One ran up
and grabbed and started swinging at
me. I don’t know if I did the right

couldn’t hold me. The right thing
was to not be on a street up the hill
alone. I was half asleep when they
jumped me — you never expect
something like that. I felt sorry, after
that, for the people who’ have to live
in places where that violence is all
around, in neighborhoods where
some people live hurting other peo-
ple. I’m sorry because now I can
begin to see what it must feel like for
them and their children to have that
violence right in their homes.

The campus police can be very
helpful with things like escorts from
buildings after late classes. You
should never have to face danger,
but it is out there. Please be careful.

Reagan administration:
noble words but racist vibrations

WASHINGTON —— Sometimes I
sit down to write a column brim-
ming with passion. Sure of myself,
firm in my conviction, I bang the
thing out only to discover in the
course of writing that I am wrong.
So I rewrite, tone it down, change
the conclusion and then have it.pub-
lished. Invariably, readers sense that
something is wrong. The words say
one thing, their vibrations some-
thing else. In the end, it’s the vibes
that count.

I offer my own experience as
something of a metaphor for the
Reagan administration and its posi-
tions on race. Time and time again,
it has been careful with its words,
documenting its positions of every-
thing from the Voting Rights Act to
the regime in South Africa with pre-
cise language, research and, of
course, an ideology that is, on the
face of it, totally non -racist. Yet,
somehow, a different message comes
through. Once again, it’s the vibes.

In the case of the Reagan adminis-
tration, the vibes come from the
president himself. In the course of a
radio address or a press conference
for which he has rehearsed well, he
might offer a cogent explanation of
either his policy toward South

Africa or voting rights, or even why
his administration once thought that
a college with racist policies is
entitled to tax-deductible status. But
sooner or later, something slips out
that shows the‘president’s position
to be something other than learned
or rational.

Recently, for instance, the presi-
dent_ offered some praise for the
South African regime: “They have
eliminated the segregation we once
had in our country — the type of
thing where hotels and restaurants
and places of entertainment and so
forth were segregated. ‘That's all
been eliminated.” Not quite. Segre-
gation of the Jim Crow variety per-
sists in South Africa. Even its total
elimination would hardly matter
when blacks are not accorded citi-
zenship and cannot, accordingly,
vote. To talk about hotels after that
is an insult.

Once, in a column, I suggested
that this sort of thing reﬂected a kind
of racism. An administration official
upbraided me, saying that the
charge of racism had become the
new McCarthyism. I think he had a
point. Certainly, the term has been
cheapened by overuse. You can be
opposed to quotas or goals, school

busing or certain kinds of social wel-
fare programs without being a
racist. In other words, people —
both black and white ~— can be
opposed to the conventional policies
and goals of what is broadly called
the civil rights movement and not be
anything approaching a racist.

So then what, exactly, is Reagan?
The frank answer is that I am not
sure —- and I’m not all that sure it
matters. The fact remains that his
career is replete with utterances on a
par with the one he made about
South Africa. This a is a president
who has opposed every civil rights
bill that has come down the track.
This is a president who credited the
integration of the armed services to
the existence of a black galley hand
at Pearl Harbor. A president who
recently concluded that the regime
in Pretoria and Bishop Desmond
Tutu are equally deserveing of criti-
cis m.

In short, this is a president whose
offhand remarks and long-held con-
victions say one thing, regardless of
what is asserted in his behalf by oth-
ers. The man has a manifest anti-
pathy for the underdog, for the
underprivileged. Just about the only
thing he gets worked up about is

high taxes. Maybe if South African
blacks demonstrated for lower taxes
instead of basic human rights, Rea-
gan would sympathize with them.
As it is now, he clearly does not.

Other Republicans understand
the vibes that Reagan sends out on
the issue of race. Some of them
merely cringe when the‘ issue is
raised; others have taken pains to
dissociate themselves from the presi-
dent. Bob Dole’s recent attempt to
set the matter straight on voting
rights is an example of that. But the
president is the president.~He sets the
tone for his party and no Bob Dole
or Jack Kemp can make a significant
difference.

Recently, a group of presidential
scholars met in New Orleans and
tried to assess the Reagan presid-
ency. There was the usual difference
of opinion, but some thought Rea-
gan' would certainly rank high
among presidents. This is the assess-

ment of scholars, who read the ‘

words. This would not be the assess-
ment of American blacks, who feel
the vibes.

Kappa Delta .Theta sorority sisters sing to “rushees” as they explore the possibility of joining

the sorority.

 

Dan M0ttsman/ The Pitt News

flfbe i:ush is on!    
Sororities seek new members.

By Evangeline D’Aquila
For The Pitt News ‘

Rush! lt’s a prominent word on
the Pitt agenda this week.

And for 240 sorority sisters who
participated in the first round ofpar-
ties Monday and Tuesday, rush is
certainly a major happening.

“My whole life is rush right now,"
said Eileeh Martin, a sophomore
member of Alpha Delta Pi. “I have
to go to‘ my classes until five, and
then work, and then to the sororities
from seven to 10.”

What is rush? One thing it isn’t is
-“rushed” on the part of the sorori-

ties. Sorority rush is the time sorori-

ties spend recruiting undergraduate"

women as members or their organi-
zations. Rush begins with 12-Round
(or Open House) parties the first
week of fall term and then moves
into Eight-and Four-Round parties.

Although rush — on the part of
the rushee —— involves only nine days
of visiting and evaluating the sorori-
ties, it represents months of plan-
ning on the sororities’ part.

The dates for Fall Rush 1985 have
been scheduled by the Panhellenic
Association since the winter term of
I984. Panhel is comprised of repre-
sentatives of Pitt’s l2 sororities and
acts as a governing body for these
organizations.

Dawn Funk, internal vice presi-
dent of Panhel, who is in charge of
all rush-related functions, said that
this year’s rush differed greatly from

previous years and should prove
more successful.

“There are two major factors that
have improved rush attendance,”
Funk said. “First, rush was better
publicized this year because Panhel
obtained the names of freshman
women and mailed 400 handwritten
letters inviting these girls to partici-
pate in rush. Second, the 12 sorori-
ties shared the same theme of ‘Seek
Greek’ for the Open House parties.”

The “Seek Greek” theme consti-
tuted a united effort by the sorori-
ties. Each house or suite was
assigned one aspect of sorority life to
use as its theme. The theme high-
lighted all sororities equally,
emphasizing Greek life instead of
promoting individual sororities.-

For example, one sorority had the
theme “Symbols and Flowers”;
handcrafted projects and ﬂowers,
symbols of the various sororities,
decorated their living room. A pres-
entation of each sorority’s symbol
was performed. Other themes that
decorated various suites were Phi-
lanthropy, History, Pledge Pro-
gram, Greek Week and Scholarship.

“Rushees got a feel for the Greek
system, which was good,” said
Funk, “especially since many of
them knew little or nothing about
sororities.” '_

Two hundred and forty-five
women registered for Fall Rush,
about the same number of partici-
pants as last year. However, because
of the success of Open House, the

)-

dropout rate between Open House
and Eight-Round parties is expected

‘ to be considerably lower than in pre-

vious years.

According to many sororities the
Open House parties were an over-
whelming success. i

“There was so much work that
went into these Open House par-
ties,” said Rae Lynn Marburger,
assistant rush chairman at Kappa

'Alpha Theta. “We had to submit one

project to each of the 12 sororities in
addition to learning information on
each‘ of the 12 projects submitted to
us. And we still have three different
rush parties to go. But we’re not
complaining. “Seek Greek’ has
taught sisters interesting facts about
fellow sororities that would never
havebeen learned otherwise.”

Still to come in rush are Eight-
Round parties on Sept. l l-l2, Four-
Round parties on Sept. 14 and Final
parties. on Sept. l7. ,

Hectic? You bet. But rush chair-
man of Kappa Kappa Gamma Janet
Kraft said there is no other way.

“There are only nine days to show
rushees what our sorority is all
about, and that is why t_here is so
much preparation. A sorority is
much more than unlimited parties
with fraternities and neat sweat-
shirts with Greek letters. When a
rushee pledges your sorority, you
know that they have seen beyond the
mixers and the sweatshirts and that

the endless hours of preparation

have_ paid off.”

 

Q‘:

The Pitt News - September 11, 1.985. A

Collegiate YMCA begins term  
requesting student volunteers

By David Zafrls
Staff Writer‘

The Collegiate YMCA’s first
volunteer meeting will be held
Thursday, September I2, at 6:30
p.m. in 637 William Pitt Union.

Pitt’s Collegiate YMCA is a stu-
dent organization that provides ser-
vices in corrections, physical and
mental health, and community and
youth programs. ' I

“A lot of people don’t know we're
up here,” said Paul Hanus, program
director at Pitt’s YMCA. “We sug-
gest anybody who's interested to

_ come."

The Collegiate YMCA, a branch

of the YMCA of Pittsburgh, was
formed in I982 when the Pitt/Oak-
land and Intercollegiate YMCAs
were merged. Pitt then joined
Duquesne University and Carlow
College as members of the Colle-
giate YMCA. Over 600 studentsa
year are involved" in the program
from the three schools, with over 70
of them from Pitt.

This year, one of the organiza-
tion’s focus is its volunteer pro-
grams. One reason why students are
attracted to the volunteer programs
may be the opportunity these pro-
grams provide to interact with many
different kinds of people.

“This means a lot to us because of
the Fiesta Bowl two years ago,” said
Cincinnati native Pettyjohn. “And it
is especially important to players
like Steve Apke, Charles Gladman
and of course, myself since we are all
from Ohio.

“The feeling in Buckeye country is
that if you don’t play for OSU then
you aren't a good football player,”
Pettyjohn said. “And I want to show
them I’m a good player. I took a lot
of abuse when I went home after the
Fiesta Bowl, and after next week I’m
going to be dealing out some abuse."

To do that, Fazio said, the players
will have to eliminate the mistakes
that were prevelant against Purdue.

“The players played hard but
made a lot of physical mistakes,"
said Fazio. “In order to beat Ohio
State, which happens to be the No.2
team in the nation, we need to play
mistake-free football.”

“I really like to work with kids,
said Jenny Helt, a sophomore at
Pitt. “I'm volunteering to be a tutor
for grade school kids."

There are I6 student-organized
volunteer programs offered by the
YMCA, ranging from planning stu-
dent activities at the School for the
Deaf to going whitewater rafting.

“We provide leadership to the stu-
dents, give them ideas and help them
run their programs, but everything
we do is run by students," Hanus
said. '

Other programs include tutoring
local grade and high school students
and preparing and serving meals to
the area’s unemployed. Each pro-
gram has a student coordinator who
motivates the volunteers.

“We have about 55 new volun-
teers, and we hope that they stay
with us,” Hanus said. “We are hop-
ing to attract more students to the
programs.”

The programs are designed so that
students can help themselves while
helping other people.

According to Executive Director
Nancy Wells, technical students
have shown a special interest in these
programs. “We get many engineers,

 

computer science majors and science
people who want to interact more
with other people," said Wells.
“They may not want to pursue their
volunteer work as a career, but they
want to meet different kinds of
personalities.”

One of the problems of attracting
students to the volunteer programs
stems from the fact that Pitt’s Colle-
giate YMCA has , no athletic
facilities.

“When you have 30,000 students
on campus and I00 other student
organizations trying to get students?
attention, it's difficult for a YMCA
with no facilities to attract
volunteers.

“Since we're a campus organiza-
tion, students can find athletic facili-
ties on campus," he continued. “So
we try to offer programs that stu-
dents can't find.”

Pitt, Duquesne and Carlow Col-
lege often plan their activities

together in the Collegiate YMCA.

“It's a great place to meet people,“
Hanus said. “We work with students
from the other universities all the ,
time. That way, our students get a
chance to meet with people they nor-
mally wouldn't.”

The session, which lasted nearly
40 minutes this week but is sche-
duled to last an hour, will be held
every Monday following a Panther
football game. There are free snacks
and refreshments available, and
after each session prizes are also
awarded. A ticket is given out at the
door to those who attend, and there
is a drawing to determine how many
will receive posters and T-shirts. The
sessions are sponsored by student
government and they started the
program to develop a better feel
toward the football players and to
improve the student‘s attitude of the
team.

“These quys are giving us all they
have,” said SGB president Luke

Kluchko. “And we have to show’

them some support.”

The students that did attend the
session said they had a good time but
agreed it would have been better
with a bigger turnout.

“It was pretty interesting, but I'd
like to see more people,” said Pitt
student Tim Geary. “The questions
were football-oriented, and there
were none of the dumb questions
that I expected to hear.”

“There weren‘t enough people
here,” said another Pitt student. “I
don‘t know how many people at
major colleges get a chance to see
and talk with their head coaches,
and I think when this type of oppor-
tunity arises more people should
take advantage.”

Despite the low attendance, there
are no current plans to cancel the
sessions.

“We really appreciate the support
the students have given us,” said
Fazio. “And we want them to know
our program and our football play-
ers better. So, next session, if you
come, bring a friend."

IN 1111: NUCLEAR ARMS RACE

We, the undersigned faculty of the (lniversity of Pittsburgh, believe that the nuclear
anns race has come to a critical juncture. For forty years since the destruction of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the world has lived with a delicate balance of terror. We are
now at the brink of a new generation of nuclear weaponry. These weapons will
undermine the limited security provided by the realization that no aggresor could
possibly win a nuclear war. Therefore, it is crucial that immediate action be taken to
terminate the development of first strike and “defensive” weapons systems, such as
the MX missile and the Reagan administration’s “Star Wars” program. We call upon
all citizens to urge the leaders of the (lnited States and the Soviet Union to wo

together to freeze the development of these weapons.

The Pitt News - September 11, 1985

Over-the-counter drugs can be dangerous to consumers

(Editor's Note: This article
reprinted from the September issue
of Reader's Digest.)

Americans are among the world’s
great consumers of medications. In
any given month, on average, each
of us uses nonprescription drugs to
treat at least three health problems.
In addition, pharmacies fill 1.5 bil-
lion doctor-ordered prescriptions a
year — six for every man, woman
and child in the country.

In 1972 the Food and Drug
Administration began a massive and
still ongoing study of the more than
700 active ingredients in over-the-
counter (OTC) drug products. The
good news is that panels of inde-
pendent experts assembled by the
FDA judged one-third of the ingre-
dients to be safe and effective. The
bad news: one-third were found to
be either unsafe or ineffective or
both. And there was insufficient
scientific proof of safety and effec-
tiveness for the final third.

As the recommendations of the
FDA panels have been published,
the drug industry has been voluntar-
ily removing from the marketplace
those OTC remedies found unsafe or
ineffective. And the FDA is now
requiring drug companies,to demon-
strate that their combination formu-
las are actually effective for the

conditions they are intended to
treat.

There are other changes, too.
Some well-established prescription
drugs have been switched to OTC
use. And after years in which little
information was made available
about the drugs they make and pres-
cribe, the industry and doctors — in
response to strong consumer
demand — are beginning to provide
written details on the risks, benefits
and proper use of drugs. It’s high
time. A 1984 FDA survey found that
30 percent of patients left the doc-
tor's office with no information for
the medicine prescribed, 74 percent

were not told about possible side

effects, and only 5 pe,r_cent received
written information on the drugs.

What should people be concerned
about? There are two key areas:

Side effects. Many people taking a
drug will notice an undesirable reac-
tion, usually minor. But even the
mildest drugs can do harm_if taken
improperly, long enough or In exces-
sive doses. An’d'»everyone responds
to a drug ‘differently.

Failure tofollow directions.Study
after study shows that 30 to 50 per-
cent of us disobey prescription
instructions on how much to take
and when. “It’s easy to fall into‘
thinking that more of the drug will
speed up the healing,” said Dr.
James W. Long, author of “The

Essential Guide to Prescription
Drugs.” It is more common, how-
ever, for people to stop taking a drug
when they begin to feel better. This,
too, can be dangerous.

Americans are becoming more
careful about what they put into
their bodies. With that in mind, here
are consumer tips on 10 commonly
used drug types (for adults only;
specifications for children will
differ).

ASPIRIN

Often called the true modern mir-
acle drug, aspirin (and its com-
pounds) reduces fever and
inflammation, relieves headaches,
arthritic and other pain, and, by
affecting blood platelets, may even
reduce the chances of clots asso-
ciated with heart disease and stroke.

But aspirin does have potential
side effects.‘ Among them:

0Stomach pain, nausea and, less

commonly, ulcers. To help prevent A

this, take aspirin with a full glass of
water.
0Ringing in the ears. A sign oftoo
high a dose, this usually goes away
when you stop taking the drug.
0Allergic reactions: skin rashes,

runny nose, wheezing, chest’

tightness.
To relieve minor aches and pains
or headache, take no more than two

ﬁve-grain aspirin tablets every four
hours for a maximum of 10 days —
three for fever. Before taking
another drug or undergoing surgery,

tell your doctor if you've been taking

aspirin.

ACETAMINOPHEN

The second-most widely used
OTC pain reliever, acetaminophen,
is found in Tylenol and many other
products. It is effective for relief of
minor aches and pains as well as
fever, but it does not have the anti-
inﬂammatory beneﬁts of aspirin. On
the other hand, it does not cause
stomach irritation. '

The -recommended dosage is the
same as for aspirin. Although aceta-
minophen is generally free of side
effects, a large overdose can lead to
serious, even fatal, liver damage.

Warning: A panel of experts

‘recently concluded that heavy pro-

longed use of pain relievers contain-
ing both aspirin and acetaminophen
increases risk of kidney disease; it’s
safer, said the panel, to use only
single-ingredient products.

AN TACIDS

These products are sold under
many brand names for “acid indiges-
tion,” “sour stomach” or “heart-
burn." (Only antacids containing

simethicone work against “gas.”)'
Antacids neutralize excess acid in
the stomach — commonly caused by
overeating, overdrinking or stress -
and come in varying strengths.

Used as directed, antacids have no
serious side effects. Used to excess,
they can cause constipation or diar-
rhea. Take antacids about an hour
after meals and not with other
medicines.

Warning: If your symptoms don’t
clear up within two weeks, see a doc-
tor. Antacids should not be used to
self-treat a suspected ulcer.

COLD,MEDICATIONS

No drug can prevent, cure or
reduce the natural course (three to
seven days) of a cold. However,
many cold medications — pain
relievers, antihistamines, decongest-
ants, lozenges, cough suppressants
—— do relieve symptoms. But note:

0Question your doctor if he gives
you a prescription medication for a
cold. If it’s an antibiotic — which
will not cure the cold —— it may be a
waste of money.

0Many widely used cold remedies
contain combinations of drugs to'
relieve two or more symptoms. The
FDA panel advises consumers not
to take combinations that treat
symptoms they do not have. '

ALLERGY DRUGS

Antihistamines sold over-the-
counter are the first line of defense
against the allergic reaction of hay
fever, but are not always effective. If
they don’t relieve your symptoms, or
if you experience shortness of
breath, see your doctor.

Warning: Antihistamines should
not be taken by people with asthma
or glaucoma, or by men with
enlarged prostates, and should not
be combined with alcohol. Besides
drowsiness, they can cause dry
mouth, nose and throat.

ANTIBIOTICS

These prescription drugs are
effective against a broad range of
bacterial and fungal infections. But
keep in mind:

0Antibiotics act over time.
Always take the.recommended dose,
even if your symptoms disappear.

0Many antibiotics should be

‘ taken only on an empty stomach,

others with food. Read the label.
0Antibiotics do not prevent or
cure viral illnesses such as colds or
ﬂu. T V 7
0Besides “bad” bacteria, they can
kill useful bacteria such as those in

the intestine that aid digestion; diar- .

rhea may result.

0Some people are allergic to
antibiotics.

0Overuse may lead to the develop-

BIRTH-CONTROL PILLS

“The pill” is the most studied drug
in history. Here, in brief, is what two
decades of research have found:

OSmoking significantly increases
the risk of heart disease and stroke in
women taking the pill, especially
those over age 35.

0The pill is not recommended for

women with high bloodgpressure, L

diabetes, liver disease or a family"
history of heart disease, regardless
of age.

0There is no firm evidence that the
pill causes cancer. In fact, govern-
ment studies indicate that it protects
against cancer of the ovary and the
lining of the uterus.

0The newer-formula pills — con-
taining lower doses of estrogen and
progesterone — are less likely to
cause weight change, breast tender-
ness, abdominal cramps or skin dis-

DIET AIDS
Many of these products contain

an appetite suppressant called phe-_

nylpropanolamine, or PPA.
Although the FDA’s panel of
experts rated PPA safe and effective
for short-time use, the FDA itself
has expressed concern about safe
dosage and has asked for more
information before making its final
decision. Two Washington D.C.
consumer groups recommend not
using it.

0The Center for Science in the
Public Interest says PPA has been
implicated in high blood pressure,
stroke and seizures, even in young,
healthy people. The group has asked
the FDA to remove PPA from the
over-the -counter market. A

Research Group says there is no evi-

specialize in treating obesity advise
that the amount of weight lost is
insignificant.

TRANQUILIZERS

Although Valium use has declined
sharply in recent years, it and the
other minor tranquilizers (chemi-

‘ cally known as benzodiazepines) are

still among the most widely used
prescription drugs. They can coun-
ter feelings of anxiety and some are
effective as muscle relaxants. But
note:

0Because of the nature of their
action in the body, tolerance some-
times develops and, over time, you
may need more of the drug. And
sudden withdrawal can lead to
unpleasant symptoms.

0Some doctors think tranquilizers -

are grossly overused. The FDA has
approved ' them for anxiety dis-

orders
lems and stress.

SLEEP AIDS

Virtually all nonprescription sleep
aids contain antihistamines, which
make you drowsy. Several consumer
groups and doctors’ groups recom-
mend against taking sleep aids, espe-
cially on a regular basis, and the
FDA has approved them for “occa—
sional use” only.

Prescription drugs to treat severe
or chronic insomnia are potent med-
icines that should not be used to
induce sleep by peoplehaving mild

Byars-less Buckeyes bite the
bullet, gear up for Panthers

Ohio State will be without All-
America tailback Keith Byars when
it hosts Pittsburgh this Saturday at
Columbus. In a comparative analy-
sis, Ohio State entering this season
without Byars is like Pitt entering
1976 without the services of Tony
Dorsett. Ohio State head coach
Earle Bruce can do nothing but spec-
ulate as to when his star running
back will return.

“Well, there is nothing we can say
about Keith now,” said Bruce yester-
day from Columbus. “I don’t know
when he will be able to play again.
The Washington State football
game [Sept. 28] is probably the
target place for Keith to come back.”
Bruce added, “We won’t know more
until he takes the cast off on Friday.
He’s been in the cast a week and a
day, so we hope it starts to heal.”

No one knows for sure just what
kind of effect Byars’ absence will
have on the Buckeyes until they take
the field against Pitt on Saturday.
“What can you say?” asked Bruce.
“He was the leading rusher last year
in the country, he was the leading
all-purpose runner, the leading
scorer, the leading pass receiver on
our football team and obviously,
he’s a great football player."

‘John Woolridge, a 5-11, I90-lb.
junior from Akron, Ohio, will
replace Byars in the Ohio State

' backﬁeld. Woolridge was the Buck-

eyes’ second-leading rusher last year
with 637 yards, but more impres-
sively, he had a per carry average of
5.9.yards. Compare that with Byars,
who averaged a bit less, at 5.3 yards
per carry. Granted, he is three inches
shorter and 46 pounds lighter than
Byars, but he is a force to be reck-
oned with, and Pitt head coach F oge
Fazio realizes that.

“With Byars there, we pretty
much knew what they were going to
do from what they did last year,”
explained Fazio. “He was going to
run the ball 40 times a game, so he
was a pretty good guy to key on.”
Fazio went on, “Now, with him not
in there, I still think that their tail-
back is going to carry the ball at least
30 times. How much passingthey
are going to do, or how many differ-
ent formations they will use, we are
not quite sure.”

CINCINNATI (UPI) — Cincin-
nati Reds player-manager Pete Rose
disappointed a sell-out. crowd of
51,045 after going hitless in a 3-2 loss
to the San Diego Padres. Rose, who
tied the all-time record for career
base hits against Chicago on Sun-
day, went 0-4 and remained tied with
Ty Cobb with 4,191 base hits.

Padre Lamarr Hoyt stifled Rose
on all four trips to the plate. Garry
Templeton’s RBI single in the sev-
enth inning proved to be the game
winner for the Padres and Hoyt,

‘Press Box

Athlete of the Week
—see page 16 I

One thing the Panthers cannot do
is go to Columbus expecting the
Buckeyes to roll over and play dead.
“I just hope our guys realize that
Keith Byars is not necessarily their
whole football team,”
“This Woolridge kid can run, their
fullbacks
Cooper and junior Mark Pﬁster] are
big and tough, and their quarter-
back [junior Jim Kartsatos] is com-
petitive, so we are playing against a
pretty good football team.”

Kartsatos, the 6-3, 2l4—lb. native
of Fullerton, Calif., will be making
his first legitimate collegiate start

this Saturday. Kartsatos did start

three games previously in his career
when graduate Mike Tomczak was
injured, and owns a 3-0 record as a
starter. Last year. he filled in for
Tomczak in Ohio’ Stateis season
opening victories over_Oregon State
and Washington State, and has
completed 37 of 68 passes for 656
yards -with four touchdowns as a
Buckeye‘. _ ,
Defensively, the Buckeyes have
taken on a new look this year. Bruce

eliminated the nose guard and will ‘

employ three linebackers instead
this year, in a sort of a 4-3 defense.
Earlier in the year, Bruce decla-
red,“The strength of our defense is
our linebackers and our improved
secondary. We have some big-play
men on defense, and that _is what it
takes towin.” _
Leading thecharge is outside line-
backer Thomas Johnson. Johnson,
a 6-3, 248-lb. senior,’is one of the top

linebackers in college football."

“Thomas Johnson is an outstanding
player," said Bruce. “He runs to the
ball, he’s big, strong, fast and he
makes the big play." ’

Senior Byron Lee plays down the
line from Johnson at defensive end,
and he is not far behind Johnson in
terms of ability. But according to
Bruce, “The other one you'd better
watch out for is Chris Spielman. He
is the most intense college football
player I have ever seen.”

, Spielman, who appeared on the
front of the Wheaties cereal box
while at high school in Massillon,
Ohio, may eat the Panthers for a late
breakfast if he lives up to Bruce‘s
expectations.

goes hi

now I4-8. Hoyt gave upjust five hits
throughout the contest.

Third baseman Buddy Bell
accounted for all the Reds scoring.
Bell’s two-run homer was the only
mistake Hoyt made. '

Rose will be in the lineup tomor-
row night when the Padres face the
Reds again. Eric Show is the sche-
duled starting pitcher for the Padres,
now in second place in the Western

. Division, a half game in front ofthe

Reds.
Rose is now hitless in his last six

said F azio.-

[sophomore George '

“I’ve watched him play since high
school, and I’ve watched him prac-
tice,” said Bruce. “I've watched him
play the games. You just have to
watch him play to know he’s the
most intense. He plays every ‘play
like it’s the last one.”

Bruce -knows that his defense will
have to play well to halt a reborn
1985 Pitt offense. He had a chance to
go to school when Pitt played
Purdue two weeks ago, and he
offered his deductions yesterday.

“I was impressed with the offen-
sive line, how they dominated the
line of scrimmage against Purdue,”
said Bruce. “Randy Dixon, [Barry]
Pettyjohn, Tony Brown and Clint

_Wilson are certainly outstanding

football players. They are very dom-

inant at the line of scrimmage, and

that ‘is one thing we are greatly con-
cerned about.” .

Two years ago, at the 1984 Fiesta
Bowl against Ohio State, Pitt quar-
terback John Congemi enjoyed his
best day as a collegiate passer. Con-
gemi completed 31 of 44 attempts
for 341 yards and two touchdowns.
Bruce is well aware that Congemi is
still around.

“We know that Congemi passed
well against us in the Fiesta Bowl for
over 300 yards," said Bruce. “So we
know they have a good passing
attack, with a good passer, and the
possibility of [Chuck] Stobart being
the coordinator that they can run a
lot of different formations, with the

«option mixed in there. So we have to

prepare for all that stuff.” Bruce

‘added,“It’s a well-geared offensive

football team that scored a lot of
points.” V
Some ‘Pitt fans may be worried

V that they will see a repeat of the Pitt-

Purdue game. “We don’t pass the
ball like that,” said Bruce. “But we
most certainly would like to run the
ball better than Purdue did against
Pitt. That would be the challenge for
our football team." In defense of the
Pitt defensive unit, Bruce added, “I
think -they were tested tremendously
in the Purdue game- by the pass, and
they did give up some yardage, but
they didn't lose the game.” -

Pitt hasn’t lost a game, and
neither has Ohio State. What Ohio
State has lost is Keith Byars. But
Byars or no Byars,-it will be a battle
this weekend.

final plate appearance against the
Cubs on Tuesday. His ﬁfth-inning

single over Cubs second-baseman

Ryne Sandberg tied Cobb and was
his latest hit.

Rose kept himself out of the Red
lineup Monday night in favor of the
best possible lineup. The Reds are
still alive in the West.

rently atop the Western Division

Berra names Stargell

(UPI) — New York Yankee
infielder Dale Berra, testifying in
a federal drug trial in Pittsburgh,
said yesterday that baseball stars
Bill Madlock and Willie Stargell
provided him with “uppers,“ or
amphetamines, while all three
played for the «Pirates. Berra
made the statement during cross-
examination in the trial of Curtis
Strong, who is charged with sel-
ling drugs to ballplayers.

Stargell is now a coach with
the Pirates. Madlock, a four-

time National League batting
champion, recently was traded to
the Los Angeles Dodgers. Earlier
in the trial, Berra told how he
bought cocaine from Strong in
1980 while fellow players and
coaches partied in an adjacent
hotel room. Berra also told of
seeing Strong visiting slugger
Dave Parker in the Pirate club-
house in I982 and said he was
warned by" manager Chuck
Tanner, “Don’t talk to that
gentleman.”

The Sporting Life

 

The new television season dazzles

By Bob Travers
Staff Writer

The new TV season is officially
upon us. I got my new big-issue TV
Guide in the mail the other day and
just now finished reading it. Facinat-
ing reading, as usual. The thing that
bothered me is that out there among
all the new cops, robots, priests and
detectives there are no new shows
about sports. I couldn't believe it.

Well, l didn't just sit back and
take it. l called up NBC and asked
them what the heck is going on—
why does this season lack such
immortal sports showsas “Lucas
Tanner" and “Ball Four?“ I called
the other networks as well and
demanded that we see some spot
sport shows during prime time. They
all said they would get back to me. I

could tell they were intimidated. I
just sat and waited for the phone to
ring. Sure enough, it did.

The three major networks and
PBS called and apologized for not
having any sports shows. They said
that in light of my complaint—l
mean my demand—their entire fall
lineup "has been redone. There is now
a plethora of ﬁne sports program-
ming (during prime time, of course).
Here is a partial listing of what we
can look for this season. Don‘t
expect to find this in TV Guide.
because its not there. l‘ve scooped
them. '

“Three Cheers”—This situation
comedy features the zany yet lovable
characters in section 654 in Veterans
Stadium. Starring is Sylvester Stal-
lone as an ex-jock who just can't
seem to get a break. Steve Landes-
berg is an intellectual who sits in the
stadium seat behind him and Dom
Deluise is “the fat guy in the front
row.” Ruth Buzzi is an off-the-wall
peanut vendor.

“The Love Boat”—lt’s tennis on
the high seas when the Pacific Prin-
cess converts to a Racquet Club. In
the first episode, guest star John

Tinsley shoots for the top

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

Keith Tinsley’s face said it all; he
didn't need words to describe his
feelings. A look of surprise was his
first reaction to the news. That was
followed by a look of relief.,And
then one of disappointment.

The reason for Tinsley’s reaction
was quite simple. The University of
Pittsburgh cornerback just got the
news that Heisman Trophy candi-
date Keith Byars will not see action
when Pitt and Ohio State meet on
Sept. l4. Byars suffered a broken

McEnroe must decide whether or
not to save an umpire who has fallen
overboard. Also starring is Tatum
O‘Neal as the captain’s daughter and
Ivan Lendl as the“evil Russian guy."

“The Dues of azzd” is
one TV show Dusquesne
coach Jim Satalin would

rather not view

“The 700 Club”—-This is a two-
man show starring Babe Ruth and

.Henry Aaron as Las Vegas night-

club owners whose playing days are
over. Willie Mays and Phillip
Michael Johnson are the in-house
detectives out to foil the mob led by
Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin.
“Green Acres”—This is a heart-
warming story of the groundskeep-
ing crew at Baltimore’s Memorial
Stadium. Robert Blake stars as the
chief groundskeeper~—tough and
crusty on the outside, but inside, a
heart of gold. Ed Asner is his radical
brother turned union activist.
“Finder of Lost Gloves”——George
Burns stars as Lefty, the equipment,
manager of the Chicago White Sox,
a team that just can‘t seem to keep

foot in practice and will be sidelined
for several games.

_“My shoulder just went ‘aaah,‘ "
Tinsley sighed in relief. “My sympa-
thies go out to him, though, He is a
great running back. One of the best.
He is really somebody to think
about. It would have been nice to
play against him. lt’s good to know
you have _played against the best,
especially if you beat them. I really
feel sorry for him.”

Tinsley may feel sorry for Byars,
but that will not affect his aggres-
siveness in going after the rest of the
Buckeyes. The Panthers have a score

track of its gear, especially its base-
ball mitts. lt‘s Lefty’s job to find
them.

“Miami lce”—The touching,
funny story of south Florida’s first
pro hockey team. Anson Williams
and Donny Most of “Happy Days"
are reunited as French-speaking
defensemen. Watch forthe fun when
the goofy pair go gator hunting with
Wild Willy Hakksaw (Charles
Bronson).

“The Dukes of Hazards"—Late
night only, this is a controversial sit-
com in the vein of “Soap" and “Buf-
falo Bill.” lt’s the story of what
happens to normal, mild-mannered
Duquesne University basketball
players when a girl accidently winds
up on their dormitory floor.

“20/20/20"—This drama centers
on the life of a high school basket-
ball star in inner-city Chicago. Eddie
Murphy stars as the wisecracking
but talented Assad. Bill Cosby is his
father. Sidney Poitier plays Coach
Hendricks. The title comes from the
fact that last year as a freshman
Assad averaged 20 points, 20
rebounds and 20 assists per game.

“Double Trouble”—Get ready for
the laughs when a mixed doubles
team suddenly finds itself playing
women’s doubles when Steve (John
Ritter) finds he has the power to turn
himself into a woman whenever he
wants. His partner Jenny (Donna
Dixon) is not only all mixed up, but
she's in love with Steve (but not his

alter ego Sally). In a kooky turn of A

events, Jenny eats some garlic and
wakes up a man. lt gets nuttier all
the time on this show.

“Solid Gold"—Those lovable
Olympic athletes finally have their
own show. Carl Lewis stars as a
temperamental medical student and
stand-up comedian. Mr. T is _his
father who doesn’t understand him.
Edwin Moses plays Carl’s wayward
brother. In a twist of past shows, the
family adopts Mary Lou Retton as
cute little kid Sally.

to settle with them and are deter-
mined to do it. V

“There is a real incentive to beat
them and make up for the Fiesta
Bowl,” Tinsley said, referring to the
28-23 defeat the Panthers suffered in
I984. “It was a well—fought game.
They won a close one. Now it is our
turn.”

And the Panthers are determined
to make the 1985 season their turn to
prove their toughness and talent.
Despite a disappointing I984 cam-
paign, the Panthers started this sea-
son off with a bang, thanks to some
fine moves by Tinsley.

The Panthers’ 3|-30 victory over
Purdue started off with moments
from last season being relived. On
their first drive, the_Boilermakers
connected on a 21-yard field goal.
But, on the following kickoff, Tins-
ley showed the fans and players that
this season would be different when

he returned the kick 70 yards and

sparked the Pitt offense.

“We needed to make the big
plays,” said Tinsley, who is a pro-
duct of Detroit's Cooley High
School. “That is one ofthe goals we
have written in the locker room.
Somebody has to exemplify leader-
ship and make the play.

“I think the crowd was a little wor-
ried at that point. Coach [Andy]
Urbanic told us that we could make
the big play. Tom Brown looked at
me and said, ‘we can do it.‘ I got the
ball and just yelled go."

And the Panthers never stopped,
not even in the closing seconds when
the odds were against them. They
held on and came out a winner.

“The game really helped build our
confidence,"Tinsley said. “It was an
unreal feeling in the lock room. The
emotional level was really high.
They say that losing is contagious;

The Pitt soccer team will be

team tonight at 7:15 in Pitt Sta-
dium. Likewise for Mercyhurst,
it will be facing a confident, tacti-
cally different Pitt team.

Head coach Joe Luxbacher

' has elected to use a more defen-
sively oriented system of play,
the 4-4-2. The 4-4-2 accentuates
Pitt’s ﬁne defensive abilities

the strikers and midfielders. _
When asked about the new

system, sophomore starter Scott
Rei'mer replied, “Teams will be
hard pressed to score against us.
We were already a strong defen-
sive team; the 4-4-2 allows us to
use this to our advantage.” Rei-
mer also mentioned the newness
of the system to the team. “We
worked hard this week on our
passing and transition game,” he
said. “Coach Luxbacher felt that
our passing was below par in Fri-
day night's game.”

The Panthers will be coming
into tonight’s game with the
added confidence stemming

from the season opening victory’

over California University of

Pennsylvania. Reimer stated,
“The team was considerably ner-
vous against California, but once
we settled down, we began to
play our own game.” He added,
“Although we’re confident about
tonight, we will not be taking
them lightly.”

Panther net-minder Dave Tor-
rence will be attempting to break
the career shutout record during
tonight’s game. He successfully
shut out California last week
during the Panthers’ 2-0 victory.
He currently has 14 shutouts,
tying his record with that of ex-
Panther goalie Frank Bucci.

(Editor’s Note: The Pitt News has
begun a weekly feature called Ath-
lete of the Week. The Athlete of the
Week award will be awarded every
Wednesday to a Pitt student-athlete
who was judged to have the most
positive impact on the sporting
world at the University of Pitts-
burgh during that past week.)

By Kelley Butt
For The Pitt News

This week's athlete of the week, in
the words of her coach, is a “legiti-
mate candidate for ‘All America.’”
Sue Hoover, junior member of the
volleyball team, is “an explosive,
quick and experienced player,”
according to Coach Shelton Collier.

Collier has coached Hoover since
she was a sophomore in high school
and a member ofthe Junior Olympic
team. Although Hoover has been
overshadowed in the past by former
Pitt standout Ulana Kohutiak, she is
an outstanding athlete in her own
right. Collier credits Hoover with
being a vital part of the highly suc-
cessful Lady Panther team of a year
ago.

As Collier- put it, “Sue is one of the
top Pitt players we’ve ever had. As a
sophomore, she made the first team
All Big East squad, though she

€ﬂ

The Pitt News - September 11, 1985

gained very little notoriety. Last sea-
son, in the Louisiana State Univer-
sity Classic, Sue led Pitt and
Nebraska in total kills; Nebraska
was a very competitive team last
year. Sue was playing against four or
five All-America players during the
NCAA play-offs and she responded
to the pressure very well.”

Not bad for a sophomore, whose
best performances were turned in
against Top 10 teams such as Texas,
Nebraska, Arizona, Tennessee and
Penn State.

Hoover’s personal goals reflect
the teams goals and vice-versa. “We
want to win the Big East, ﬁnish
among the top 16 teams in the
NCAA and maintain our national
ranking, but we’re taking it one step
at a time and as a team — together,”
she commented. “I’m looking for-
ward to this season because there are
so many good players. We work
together very well and we get along.
The team plays a lot better when we
‘are a team.”’

As a 5-8 mid-blocker for a major
college team, Hoover must con-
stantly prove herself on the court

past weekend — with 61 kills, which
is more than any player on any team
— displayed her strong determina-
tion to be in the top-ranked teams in
the nation.

Right now, with the first set of
matches out of the way, Hoover and
the rest of the team are looking to
the Illinois State University tourna-
ment this weekend. Hoover is defi-
nitely “looking forward to meeting
Stanford simply because they
ranked among the top 10 teams in
the NCAA. I think we’re up for the

-challenge, but we can’t forget to
keep our eyes on the Big East. Dur-
ing the recent action against UD,
Kent State and UM, we worked as a
team and despite the rough edges,
things went pretty much like
clockwork.

“You can’t single out one player as
indispensible,” Hoover continued.
“We can’t do without one player on
the court  we’re a team.”

Pettyjohn ready for revenge

A By Michael Bertonaschi

Staff Writer

Barry Pettyjohn would
nothing more than to silence his
friends back home in Cincinnati,
Ohio. Cincinnati is Ohio State
Buckeye territory, and the senior
center has been the victim of verbal
abuse ever since the Buckeyes eeked
out a 28-23 victory over the Pan-
thers. The win came on a touchdown
pass with 39 seconds remaining in
the 1984 Fiesta Bowl.

Pettyjohn and the rest of the
Panthers will have an opportunity
for revenge this Saturday night in
front of 90,000 screaming Buckeye
fans. It will be the first night game in
Ohio Stadium history, and accord-
ing to Pettyjohn, “There will be a lot
of pride on the line.”

The Panther offensive line will be
up against a defensive alignment to
"which they have never been exposed.
coach Earl Bruce has
employed a unique system in which
there are only two down linemen. He
uses a linebacker instead of a nose
tackle, who stands about a yard off
the ball. They also use two standup
defensive ends in the same manner
that Pitt does, and they have three
linebackers in the middle.

The alignment can be described as
a 2-5 or a 2-6, and according to Pet-
tyjohn, they will “try to have their
two down linemen keep our guards
and tackles off their linebackers.”

Because of the revamped defense

. by Ohio State, Pitt is not sure what

to prepare for. “It's to their advan-
tage because they haven’t played a
game yet, so we haven’t seen any film
on them, but they have seen us,”said
Pettyjohn. “I’m sure we'll have to
make some adjustments on the side-
lines after the first couple series.”
Pettyjohn was forced to make an
adjustment during fall camp. Injur-
ies to starting center Ed Miller and

Center Barry Pettyjohn follows in the Pitt tradition

backup Pat Schipani left Pitt with-
out a center. Pettyjohn moved over
from the guard position to center
where he had started in 1983. “I

, don’t care where I playjust as long as

I’m out there and we’re winning,” he
said.

For a while, it looked as though he
would not be able to play anywhere.
A moth managed to crawl inside his
car during practice at Edinboro and
got stuck. He was brought back to
Pittsburgh to have the stubborn crit-
ter removed, and his car got

infected,’-causing him to miss a week ,

of practice. But Pettyjohn has found
a way to keep other bugs away. “I
wear No-Pest Strips inside my ear,”
he said, laughing. '
Last season, when the offensive

line needed a yard, the play almost

always went over All-America
tackle Bill Fralic. With Fralic now
opening holes for the Atlanta Fal-
cons, who will get the call when a
tough yard is needed? “This year, we
have five guys we can run over, and
