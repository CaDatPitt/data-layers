MC Chapel Board
Representatives

Will Be Chaplains

Two new. Chapel Board repre-

sentatives from Men’s Council will '

serve as the otﬁcial MC chaplains
during the new Council adminis-
trative year. ,

‘Council approved the innovation
at their meeting last Wednesday
evening in the Panther Room. The
representatives will give an invo-
cation before each Council meet-
ing. -

MC President Ron Sobel an-
nounced at the meeting that one
of the representatives will be ap-
pointed on a two-year tenure pe-
riod, and the other on a one-year
basis.

A new policy of handling of
absentee members was pre-
sented by the Executive Com-
mittee. Danny O’Connell, MC
vice - president, announced that
the constitional by-law dealing
with absenteeism will be rigid-
ly enforced next semester. The‘
by-law states that a member

missing four meetings without.

having an excuse, will be ex-
pelled from Council.

O’Connell also stated that a
member arriving at a meeting late,
or one leaving early will be as-
sessed with a half-absence. Eight
half-absences will constitute four
absences, and the Councilman will
be liable for expulsion.

During the past semester, MC
didn’t have a quorum on several
occasions. Because of this ab-
senteeism, Council legislation has
been crippled. '

Putting on the Pressure

Today’s announcement that an NAACP chapter (Na-
tional Association for the Advancement of -Colored People) ,

-has been recognized on campus brings to the fore two very

important considerations in the civil liberties. There is a.
need on this campus for students to realize. the racial im-
plications in the States and, certainly, to solve those racial
problems that exist on this campus. .

NAACP throughout the country is ﬁghting a brave
uphill struggle to win equal rights for~Negroes in all walks
of life. Because NAACP urges for quicker, action than other
groupsto comply with the Supreme Court decision, it has
been branded by too many as a radical organization, al-

though some of the action it has taken has been bold.

No one will deny that NAACP is a pressure group. Yet,

it must exist until major political parties realize that civil

rights is not a political foo/tballto be-tossed about like the
proverbial hot potato on election years. So, too, at this
University, NAACP steps in to educate the ‘personnel to
the important cause of civil liberties which is so often ig-
nored merely because most peopleihere have never been
barred from a skating rink or a swimming pool in the
‘Pittsburgh area. \‘

NAACP will demand a strong following and deserves
increased membership for the job of education it can do
for students who must. broaden their outlook on life. But
NAACP members would be the ﬁrst to urge that their
organization be disbanded when other groups rise on campus
which offer along with other platforms a suitable program
for the defense of civil liberties. _

This is a position the Young Democrats .and Young
Republicans must accept. But until they prove that they
can handle the subject thoroughly’, we strongly support
NAACP at this University.

Within the University itself, segregation in fraterni-
ties, and even segregation or self—segregation in the Tuck
Shops must be mediﬁed by NAACP and any other indiv-
iduals who want to see the Universitya liberal institution.

H013 u Secular Campus

Each of the Senior Class presidents ha-s sent letters to
graduating seniors informing them of a special chapel serv-
ice being held,May 23 in their honor. The service, en-
dorsed by these class leader, will be the last one students
will atten das undergraduates in Heinz Chapel.

While most students will attend Chapel, many will
not for theological reasons. ‘Although discussions, are con-

stantly taking place to resolve the difficulty, it will yet be '

a long time before all persons will worship there at will.
A Despite these implications, Heinz Chapel should re-
main for all students an ediﬁce which stands forihealthy
spiritual growth on_.a secular campus.

lvory Towers in the Market Place

By lrv Rofhman

Last semester, an evening school student storm-
ed into the Pitt News’ office demanding to now
where the veteran’s office was located. VVe ex-
plained to him in the bemused style of nonchalant
journalists who have everything they want open
until 5 p.m. that the office is located in 801 CL.
But we didn’t have the keys. And he couldn’t get
in. .

Leaving his card — that of a
well-to-do businessman — he
stormed out saying ineffect that -
Evening School students were
the lost tribe of the University.

And we realized what he
meant. For quite a spell, eve-
ning students here have had no
meals in the cafeteria or tuck
shops, no cloakroom, no .advisory
aid through a student advisor, less parking than
students becauseof the many that drive, and few
recreation facilities for meetings. S
Regretful Emphasis

So it came as no surprise to us, to read in a re-
cently—issued book Ivory Towers in the Market
Place that there is a breed of theorists who put
“regretful emphasis on' what it considers the fac-
tors that keep it (evening students) from being the
same — lower standards, inability of the student
to do as much library, work, etc.” ,

This is not to say that Pitt’s Evening School
office has not considered these factors; they ,cer—
tainly have attempted to encourage closer rela-
Ltions through ESA and professional fraternities —
but they can do only so "much with low ﬁnances
and poor meeting facilities. _ .

It is a similar problem to that of day students;
but, of course, and John Dyer presents this idea in
his book, the responsibilities of evening people to
business positions and family far more complicate
their turning University environment into a re-
laxing contemplative experience. ' . A

So a critic not only shares the
’ “right to criticize”

A distinction should be made‘
between criticism and “expert

ment upon a particular subject
by someone who has studied and
become ‘accomplished in that
subject. A critic may and should

not deal with a subject more
controversial than Tuck Shop

To Teach This Summer

A distinguished Visiting lecturer from England will teach
two courses in Pitt’s English department this summer. Her-
bert Howarth, who has just completed a ﬁve-year -tenure
as director of Britain’s National Book League, will lecture
both on the renaissance, with a focusgon Elizabethan criti-
cism, and on contemporary British literature from the period

1900-1955.

of today. He has written a book
on the contemporary literature of
Britain which is to be published
next year. Last summer, Howarth
lectured at the University of
Michigan.

Howarth is a graduate of Ox-
ford University where he majored
iin and took a ﬁrst—class honors
degree ‘in Shakespearean . studies.
After his graduation in 1939, he
lectured; at the University of Cairo
in Egypt. In 1941, he became Press
Officer to the British Embassy in
Cairo, and from 1943 to 1945 serv-
ed as, Assistant Information Offi-

cer to the Palestine Government.

Howarth personally knows most¢
of the well—known British authors!

Lectures Follow Resignation

He resignediin protest of the
Middle East policy at that time.
He lectured in the University of
London until 1949 when he joined
the National Book League of which
he became director.

I-lowarth’s present dominating
interests include the writing’ and
interpretation of English poetry,,
the translation and comparison of
certain classical and contemporary
foreign literatures, Middle East
politics, and sociology, Oriental
carpets, textiles, and antique sil-
ver.

ited company. Seven Gilfillan plants are
located in Southern California, with Engi-
neering Headquarters at Los Angeles. Gil-
fillan is large enough to handle all phases
of research, design and development, yet
not so large a man gets lost. The individual's
growth is assured by the continuing Gilfillan
expansion -program. '

WHAT WILL BE MY“F_l-ELD" OF WORK?
Will I b_e confined to one field or have
opportunities in a diversity of fields?
Will these include “tomorrow's" new-
est areas of electronics development?

Gilfillan is best known as the pioneer of

GCA radar and all its major improvements,
including the Gilfillan" GCA Quadradar—yet

GCA is only one facet of Gilfillan activities. _

The firm has been engaged as a prime'sup-
plier of rdsearch, development and produc-
‘tion of Military Electronics Systems since
1942, including Missile Guidance systems,
airborne and ground; Electronic Counter-

.measur_es; Navigational Radar (GCA and

AGCA); and Electronic Radar Trainers. Gil-
fillan is now concerned with many of today's
newest, classified areas of electronics ex-
ploration and development.

CAN I IMPROVE MY PROFESSIONAL
KNOWLEDGE AND STATUS? I

' D wiu tuition be paid by_my firm? ’

D Will I be given aid in publishing

technical articles?

D will the experienceof-.the entire
engineering group be available to me?

Gilfillan pays tuition at universities or tech-
nical institutes. Ali possible aid is given in
individual publishing of technical articles.
Continuing symposiums make the total
knowledge of the Gilfillan engineering staff
available to the individual.

WHAT ABOUT THE STABILITY OF MY
‘JOB?

D Does it depend on temporary big
contracts? ‘

Is the firm a “war baby'f type that
may or may not be perm.anent?

Gilfillan _has appointed new engineers every

_ year since the firm was established in 1912.

Current openings are in no sense emer-

gency or temporary big contract jobs, but

part of continuing Gilfillan expansion. I

I Howlongwill you be “Junior” in your job?

‘READ THIS CHECK LIST BEFORE MAKING A -FINAL DECISION.

‘THE ARMY’S CORPORAL. Prime Contract

Propulsion Laboratory of California Insit-
tute of Technology. Prime Contracts, for
Development (‘improvement and simplifica-

tion of ground and airborne electronics sys-.

tems; and Production (ground guidance sys-

Gilfillan also holds Prime Contracts, many

developmental, with the Air Force, Army‘
Ordnance, Army Signal Corps, United States.

Navy, Royal Canadian Air Force, Royal
Australian Air‘ Force, South African"Air
Force and the French Government.

WHAT ABOUT MY JOB LOCATION ‘I

Is it in -an area with few other
electronics firms, so I might find
myself in a backwater? _

E] is it in the center of the industry, so -
there are many opportunities if lwant
. to make a change?

Gilfillan ‘Engineering Headquarters is in
Los Angeles, now the center of the Elec-
tronics Industry, with more than 165 firms
in operation..Among these, Gilfillan reputa-
tion is tops, broadening opportunity if the
Gilfillan -engineer should decide to go else-
where. However, it is fair to say that, once
acquainted with the firm's operation, Gil-
fillan engineers plan to stay permanently,
because of superior opportunities for a
comprehensive, remunerative, and secure
lifetime career. -

CAN I GET, MORE GILFILLAN FACTS?
B By correspondence?

'3 Personally?

Both. Address specific inquiries to R. E.
Bell, Gilfillan Bros., 1815 Venice Blvd.. Los
Ange|es,Ca|if.An interview will be arranged.

HEN Mother was a coed, she didn't drive much. But

when she did,_a man usually went along. Theman
wasan indispensable sccessory—to ﬁx the'car when "it

got bulky.

If today’: coed takes a man along, it's strictly for com-
pany. Fixing her make-up in the rear-View mirror is the
only kind of "car repair” she needs to know.

i From the beginning, auto makers have aimed for a vir-
tually trouble-proof car. They've spent ‘millions to get
cars that way. it helps explain why so many car: today use

Timken° tapered roller bearings to overcome friction in
vital moving parts—in wheels, in pinions, in steering
gears. Every American car but one uses Timken bearings

to keep them on the go with minimum maintenance.

Keeping cars rolling along smoothly is just one example
of how the Timken Company keeps America on the go-
by working hand-in-hand with all industry. By pioneering

- improvements in machines and machinery. By increasing

speed and precision, decreasing west and maintenance:

The pioneering spirit has helped make us the world’:
largest manufacturer of tssaeted roller bearings and removo‘
able rock bits, and a lost ing producer of line alloy steel.

. Becausiethc best place to keep going—-and be? going up
-—is with a company that’: on the go, you may be nterestedi
in whaflies ahead for promising college graduates at the
Timken Company. For details, write {or our booklet

Pantherveakness
In Field Events
Gives ND The Win

Whenever a track team
meets an opponent such as
Notre Dame, they must have
strong contenders in the ﬁeld
events as well as the running
events if they expect to win.
Coach Carl Olson’s thinclads
didn’t have that necessary strength
in the ﬁeld events, Saturday, at
they went
down before the Fighting Irish of
Notre Dame, 821/2-481/2, before a
crowd of about 3,000.

In the six ﬁeld events—-the shot
put,_ high jump, pole vault, broad
jump, javelin, and discus——the Ol-
sonmen could manage to tally only
7% points while the South Bend-
ers were registering 46. The ﬁeld
events’ margin was 39 points; the
overall spread was 34 points. Need

more be said why the Jungle Cats

lost the meet?
Despite their dismal showing in
the ﬁeld tests, there were some
bright spots for the locals in the
races where Arnie Sowell notched
triumphs in the mile and the half
mile (1:52) while anchoring the
‘mile ‘relay team -to victory in
.3:17.4. -
Sowell Runs Mile in 4:15
Herb Carper won the century
in :09.8, Chuck Heﬂin ﬁnished ﬁrst
in the 440-yard dash in 50.2, and
Paul Thrash took the 220-yard low

hurdles in :24.3 for other indi-

dividual honors.

Most fans anticipated a Stad-
ium record-breaker in the mile
grind with Sowell and Billy
Squires pitted against each oth-
er. ~Squires held the" Stadium
record of 4.14:6 before the duel,
and the Irish ace remained the‘
record holder after the race was
over despite Sowell running his
fastest mile—4:15—in the three
times he has gone to the post
during his collegiate career.

Squires was supposed to push
Sowell to the new mark, but at
the ﬁnish Amazin’ Arnie was al-
most walking, with the Irish chal-
lenger trailing a good 50 yards.
This earned Squires the third spot
behind the locals’ Wendell Har-

Squires Disappointed A
Squires, disappointed at his
showing, related that “I haven’t

Stars Honored

‘The Varsity Lettermen’s Club
honored 13 athletes with plaques
recently at a luncheon in the Sch-

‘enley Park Hotel as being the

“most valuable player” to their
respective teams.

As usual, the fleet-footed Arnie ‘

Sowell raced off with the most
plaques when the cinder whiz
was presented ‘the track and
cross-country awards.

Other MVP awards went to
John Paluck for his grid feats
this past season; Joe Fenwick,
captain of the basketball team;
Ed DeWitt, 167-pound NCAA
wrestling champion; Bob Cheery,
leading scorer in soccer this past
season; Bill Schmitt, top slugger
on the baseball team; Will Starz
in gymnastics; Jim Zurcher in
swimming; Noel Gillette in ten-
nis; Dick Ryabik in golf; Len
Reeves in squash; and Dave
Jacobson in rifle.

There were also ﬁve awards
given to athletes in the dental
school. The dental students _hon-

ored were halfback Nick Passode- '

lis; soccer star Mike Culhane;
Hugh Peery, assistant wrestling
coach; swimmer Warne White,
and Barrier Fisher, manager of
the baseball and football teams.

Herschel H. Lifomls. Jr.. will receive his B.S. degree in electrical f ‘ ..

engineering from Cornell University June 1957. Herschel is a member
of the freshman and varsity riﬂe teams, an associate member of Octa-
gon, a dramatic group, and belongs to Theta Chi Fraternity. Like
many other students, he’s making employment plans early.

 

Peter J. Ivleshkoff joined DuPont at the Jackson
Laboratory in 1941, after obtaining a B.S.Ch.E. from
the University of Detroit and an M.S. from the Uni-
versity of Michigan. He hashad a wide range of Du Pont
experience, from chemist ‘in the Dye Works to chief
supervisor and works engineer at several plants, with
many opportunities to observe Du Pont personnel
policies. Today Pete Meshkoif is works engineer at
Du Pont’s new Film Plant at Circleville, Ohio.

Your question is a natural one, Herschel—one we hear

quite often. Du Pont is unquestionably a large company

in total number of employees and in all its operations.

But, actually, Du Pont is made up of ten independent

departments, almost as if it were ten companies under.
one management. And it is a fundamental policy at

Du Pont to promote from within and on merit only.

Peter Mesh koff answers:

That produces many opportunities for new men, but

in addition there are proportionately more promotions

at Du Pont each year-—by reason of expansion and re-
tirement—-than you would ﬁnd in most smaller com-
panies. I say “proportionately more” because Du Pont
has grown at an average rate of seven per cent a year for
the past 153 years—a record that few companies can .
match.

And Du Pont is still growing, rapidly. Take your ﬁeld,
electrical engineering. A host of novel and challenging
problems have to be faced, both in new construction and
in maintenance. There are plants to design with features
that have never been applied before; there are new
equipment-control problems to work out, and new engi-
neeringpii-ociesses to pioneer. So, to answer yourvquestion
in a’ word, Herschel, I'd say your chances of promotion
on merit are extremely goodat DuPont!

By Al Abrams

After the hapless showing the 1956 baseball club has made to date
this year (the record as of this writing stood at 2-9), we decided to

effort to ﬁnd the reason, or reasons, for their dismal showing.

' ‘ able to accomplish up until the end of the Second World War.

It seems that every time the Panthers would build up a strong

team and have a good season, something came along and deempha-

' sized the sport. Take the case of the year 1917. The teams had
battled through one losing season after another, ﬁnally came up
with a 12-3-1 record—the best ever compiled ‘by a University of

Pittsburgh tea.m—-and the strains of “When Johnny Comes March--

\

ing Home” slowly edged in and the Panthers had to shut down on

, the baseball business for two years.

Picking up again in 1920, the locals continued playing until 1924

when they reached another good season with nine wins and only two ‘
defeats, Then the old “deemphasis bug” hit again, and they didn’ti

ﬁeld a basebal lteam until 1939.

The years from 1939 to 1946 were lean ones for the Blue and Gold ;
. -as they had only one winnng season. But in 1947 the Panthers started l 
‘a resurgence, and came out of it by having winning seasons in‘ six of 1

' l

the eight seasons through 1954.

This now_ brings us to the present time—_—the past season and
the present one. In‘ 1955 the season ended with an 8-12 record,

not have the material with which to work. In the days of 1947 and 1948, '

when the Panthers were on the upsurge, they had an over abundance
of good players and had to cut some of them in order to keep the squad

within the prescribed limits. Now, thePanthers have a need for play-

ers and there are not enough turning out to ﬁeld a competent team

This situation must be remedied if the University intends to keep

Pi-tt Indian t’rader, Revolutionary War general, and pioneer-

describe Allegheny County history in “A Goodly Heritage,”

Included in her novel approach to the -study of history is

a certain man’s bequest to his9

_ Read Wills «

For the book, the former ESA
student read one hundred of the
Allegheny County Will Books;
then she selected wills from the
ﬁrst three. Formerly a librarian
and statistician with the trust de-
partment of a_ large Pittsburgh
bank, Miss Chalfant spent eighteen
years of: study and research into
the earliest ﬁduciary records in’
Allegheny County. _

And through these records of
families she has gotten a picture
of the customs, language, and
geography of early Pittsburgh.

As part of the inside book
jacket of “A Goodly Heritage,”-
there is a 1787 map of the manor ,
of Pittsburgh. This pictures the
present Golden Triangle as par-
celed out ot various private land
owners‘ from the three rivers to

Grant Street. Gimbels Depart-

ment Store land was owned by

Messrs. Newman and Sample.
I The map was made,for the Wil-
liam Penn family by Colonel
George Woods. Col. Woods, ex-
plained in a note on the map that
certain sizes of lots were “oc-
casioned by the—Buildings to serve

the Inhabitants." , _ t
