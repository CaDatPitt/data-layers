“I think that all of us are very worried
about the way that the administration is

chair of classics. “The provost wants cuts
and reallocations. In principle, I think that
many of us agree. Our concern is with the
way it’s been handled.” ,

Gill and others said the review has hit
the humanities disproportionately. Nine of
12 programs across the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences marked to be reviewed,
reduced, oreliminated are in the humani-
ties.

There are 16 total departments in the
humanities area; nine of them, or 56.25
percent, were placed in categories four,
ﬁve, or six in a 1995 report that is being
used as a guide in the current review
process. Of the 193 faculty members in
the humanities, 68, or 35 percent, are in
the affected departments.

“What it tells me is that the deans did-
n’t know how to review the humanities
departments,” said David Bimbaum, chair
of the Slavic department.

City Councilman Bob O’Connor pledged to get more
federal aid for Pittsburgh after announcing his intention to
seek the Democratic endorsement in the city’s upcoming
expressed concern about the lack of facul— mayoral race.

Last Thursday night, nearly 2,500 people packed the
ballroom in the Station Square Sheraton Hotel to hear
O’Connor’s announcement.

The endorsement is considered by both Murphy and
O’Connor campaigns to be a big step in getting the needed
votes in the May primary. After the primary results are tab-
ulated, the party selects its nominee, and the losing candi-

Wecht aims to dispel JFK theory

Coroner claims lone gunman idea is ”nonsense”

Heidi Price

 

Allegheny County Coroner Cyril
Wecht met with the University
Democrats on Wednesday night and
discussed the unsolved questions sur-
rounding the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy in 1963.

In his presentation, Wecht chal-
lenged the theory that Lee Harvey
Oswald acted alone, calling it “com-
plete nonsense.” He also questioned
the government’s claims that it did
not try to cover up mistakes made in
the investigation along with the
extent to which the government
admits it was involved in the investi-

gation.

Wecht did not become involved
in the case until about a year after
Kennedy’s assassination. In February
of 1965, Wecht was asked by the
American Academy of Forensic
Sciences to submit a paper on the
report of the Warren Commission.

Wecht, who holds a law degree
from the University of Maryland,
said that it was illegal for federal
agents to remove Kennedy’s body
from Parkland Memorial Hospital,
where it was originally taken after
the shooting. He supported the state-
ment, saying that murder is a capital
crime, not a federal one, and should

Russian President Boris Yeltsin
to hold summit in Helsinki

Around the World l

QUITO, Ecuador — Even though
Congress has told him that he is no longer
president, Abdala Bucaram barricaded
himself inside the national palace this
weekend. He said that he won’t let the
government be turned over to “congres-
sional conspirators.” The ultimate force of
power in Ecuador, the military, was sent to
the palace for security reasons, but it is
refusing to take sides in this dispute.
Congress voted last Thursday to
remove Bucaram because of “mental
incapacity” because of erratic behavior
and political stunts as the country became
economically stagnant. The Congress
named its leader, Fabian Alacom, as inter-
im president until new elections can take
place. But Bucaram’s vice president,
Rosalia Arteaga felt she should assume the
presidency. She claims that the constitu-
tion states that the vice president takes
over when the president is removed.
Regardless of. who becomes president,
Bucaram must be removed from the
national palace ﬁrst. Associated Press

Across the Nation
WASHINGTON‘ —— Russian President

Boris Yeltsin will hold a summit meeting
with President Clinton in Helsinki,

Finland sometime in March. Finland was
often the meeting site during the Cold War
because of its neutrality, but aides say that
the reason for Helsinki being the site is

1 because of Yeltsin’s health. The two will

likely talk about NATO expansion among
several topics. Associated Press

WASHINGTON —— The claim that two
ﬁghter pilots were playing games with :1
Nations Air jet by shadowing it in restrict-
ed military airspace was denied by mili-
tary ofﬁcials. The New Jersey Air
National Guard jets ﬂew so closely to the
commercial plane that collision alarms
were set off three times, and airport radar
indicated that the planes had merged
together. 3,,

‘”I'here’s two reasons why this hap— 
pen ,” said Nations Air President Mark 

McDonald. “Either the pilots screwed up 5"

or they were playing games with our air-
plane and they got caught.” Military offi-

. cials said the planes were on a training

mission and were checking out an uniden-
tiﬁed plane but Nations Air said that it had
gained permission to ﬂy through the air-
space. Navy spokesman, Capt. Mike John,
stood behind the airline’s claim, saying
that the ﬁghter pilots had been warned
about civilian planes being in the area, and
the pilots acknowledged receiving the
wanting. Associated Press

Wecht

not have involved the government.

“Federal agents literally pushed
their way out with the body,” said
Wecht. “They pushed aside the med-
ical examiner and the county coroner.
Hands were on guns, a lot of profan-
ity, threats were made, and the feds
took the president’s body.”

At Love Field, Kennedy’s body
was accompanied by his wife on a
plane and ﬂown to Bethesda Naval
Medical Center, where an autopsy
was performed at 8 p.m.

Wecht said he feels at this point
that serious mistakes were made in
the investigation, beginning with the
selection of the two pathologists per-
forming the autopsy.

“The two naval pathologists
called upon had never done a single
medical, legal autopsy in their entire
careers,” said Wecht. “They were
chosen because they were career
naval pathologists, both with just a
few years to go to retirement. There
was no way they were going to
ignore authority.”

Authority, according to Wecht,
came in the form of three dozen offi-
cials in the autopsy room, including
two four—star generals.

During the course of the autopsy,
Wecht said another error occurred
when pathologists did not consult
with the doctors back at Parkland
Memorial Hospital. He said the
pathologists were unaware that a bul-
let hole in Kennedy’s neck had been
enlarged by the doctors at Parkland
in an attempt to insert a breathing
tube into Kennedy’s trachea.

In the pathologists’ report to the
Warren Commission, no mention was
made of a gunshot wound to the
neck.

Wecht challenged other aspects
of the Warren Commission’s report,
including the contention that Oswald
acted alone. He demonstrated to the
audience how it would have been a
near impossibility for Oswald to
have fired all three shots at the pres-
idential motorcade.

Firearms experts, using the same
weapon that Oswald used, a
Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, deter-
mined that it takes at least 2.3 sec-
onds to shoot, reload, and fire again
at a moving target.

Wecht also pointed out that
Oswald failed his first marksmanship
test in the Marines and got a C+ on

 

THE PITT NEWS 3

FROM PAGE 1 '

his second test.

In reviewing the home movie that
caught the events of the assassina-
tion, better known ‘as the Zapruder
film, Wecht said that Kennedy and
Governor Connally were both struck
by bullets within 1.5 seconds of each
other.

Throughout his presentation,
Wecht presented other facts that he
said discount the single bullet theory,
including the fact that the path the
bullet would have had to take to
wound Kennedy and Connally as it
did, is illogical.

Wecht’s involvement in the
investigation of the‘ Kennedy assassi-
nation has not been without conse-
quence.

“There were some organizations
which I’d had involvement with and
had been invited to lecture at, and as
my own career was moving ‘forward,
these things were not being repeated.
I was not invited back,” Wecht said
in a private interview.

“Some of it might have occurred
because of other people’s fears. They
didn’t want to incur the wrath of the
FBI or other governmental organiza-
tions that I have been critical of.”

Wecht, who had served as coro-
ner for Allegheny County from 1970-
1980, returned to that position in
January of 1996. Since his return, he
has been criticized by many for his
involvement in many high—publicity
cases and investigations.

He has written several books on
his theories involving deaths of
celebrities. '

His book, “Cause of ,Death,”
explores his views on Kennedy’s
death and the way it was investigat-
ed. The book also explores possible
explanations on the deaths of Robert
Kennedy, Mary —Jo Kopechne, and
others.

His most recent book, “Grave
Secrets,” was published four months
ago and gives an account of his views
on the tragedy at Waco, Texas, the
death of Kurt Cobain, and the murder
of Nicole Brown Simpson.

“I can’t say that I dislike. [the
attention]. I don’t go out and solicit
‘Unsolved Mysteries,”’ said Wecht,
who will be appearing in an upcom-
ing episode of the show.

“It’s ego—gratifying. It’s part of
what I do, and I’m. proud to have
reached this status in my profession.”

Corrections:

The department of communication science and disorders has been moved from FAS to
the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. It is no longer a category six depart-
ment scheduled to be eliminated, as reported last Monday.

The Campus Women’s Organization does not work with the pro-choice escorts every
week, as reported Tuesday. Members do try to go as often as possible.

dent.
Digressing at times from the pre-
pared speech he had before him,

O’Connor emphasized a much more

aggressive pursuit of federal and state
money than current Mayor Tom Murphy
has undertaken.

“Philadelphia gets it. Cleveland,
Baltimore and Indianapolis get it 
Pittsburgh gets crumbs,” said O’Connor.
“That will change if I am mayor.”

The crowd, dotted with tall, hand-
lettered signs with the names of the
City’s many districts, clapped in agree-
ment when O’Connor criticized
Murphy’s inaction on pursuing funding.

O’Connor said that Murphy’s
administration has left Pittsburgh limp-

'|'HE PITT NEWS

, ing with a stagnant economy and no true

leadership or direction. \

“There is no excuse for this,” he
said.

Utilizing the city’s current
resources, said O’Connor, is the key to
rebuilding the city. ,

He said that Pittsburgh’s education-
al institutions, hospitals, and technology
research centers are the industries with
the strongest outside economic draw for
the city and that the city should tap their
potential.

“When you want to win, you play to
your strengths, and our strength is the
people of Pittsburgh,” said O’Connor.

O’Connor went on to say that he
will provide a leadership that will guide

 

 

the people of Pittsburgh out of econom-
ic stagnation that “the people of
Pittsburgh  given the opportunity, can
overcome.”

The crowd again sounded in agree-
ment with applause.

“Are you ready to elect a mayor

who will put Pittsburghers first?” asked ~
O’Connor near the end of his announce- V

ment.

“YES!” was the unified answer that
rang out in a response that was ultimate-
ly drowned out by a ﬂood of clapping
and cheering. -

As O’Connor stepped down from
the dais and into a swarm of television
cameras and microphones, the crowd
broke into chants of “One time, Tom!

Tom is gone!” and “No more Murphy’s
Law!”

Balloons and confetti rained down
onto the buffet of fried chicken and hot
dogs as O’Connor began shaking hands
and posing with constituents for the
ﬂashing bulbs of cameras.

Murphy’s re-election headquarters
didn’t share the festive mood.

Karen Ball, Murphy’s campaign
manager, issued a statement that said,
“Mayor Murphy plans to run a positive
campaign which focuses on what is
right about Pittsburgh. We expect
Councilman O’Connor will do the
same.”

Ball questioned the councilman’s
announcement, saying that he has sup-
ported “a majority of the Mayor’s bud-
getary and policy initiatives.”

But many of those in attendance
questioned nothing and supported
O’Connor for a variety of reasons.

Some said they support him because
of personal friendship and character,
while others said they are rallying
behind him because of political aims
that they say Murphy has not met.

One supporter donned a hard hat
plastered with O’Connor support slo-
gans and supported a wooden stake with
campaign sign nailed to it.

One O’Connor fan, Ed Carr from
Greenﬁeld, said he was there because he
doesn’t want to see Pittsburgh wither
and die in a competitive country-wide
market.

“I want a strong city,” said Carr. “I
want to see the tax base back. I want to
see the population back.”

He said he is concerned that his 6-
year-old daughter may have to move out
of the city when she starts looking for a
job. He said he doesn’t want her to have
to move to the South to find work, but
rather ﬁnd a place in what he hopes will
be a thriving economy.

“I want something here for her,”
said Carr. “[O’Connor] is a good keeper
of the castle, so to speak.”

Another supporter, Bernie O’Lare
from Squirrel Hill, said that he supports
O’Connor because O’Connor’s family
always runs with his in Pittsburgh’s
annual Great Race.

“We haven’t heard much [about the
issues O’Connor supports], but we’re
keeping our ears open, I guess,” said
O’Lare.

Standing along the wall were two
O’Connor supporters who toted a sign
indicating they were from Bloomfield.
Both were veterans.

One of them, Ray Fern, is the com-
mander of the Allegheny County VFW
and said Murphy doesn’t give veteran’s
groups “a fair shake.”

Fern said he is tired of lobbying
Murphy to replace a leaking roof on
Soldiers and Sailors Hall of Valor, and
he wants people to “get together and put

[Murphy] out.”

Student Government Board tries to spark student interest in city politics

rc Nuzzo

 

In an effort to strengthen the student
voice in government, Student
Government Board members said that
they are working to show candidates that
students care.

In pursuing that goal, the SGB
Governmental Relations Committee sent
several representatives to City
Councilman Bob 0’Connor’s mayoral
candidacy armouncement on Thursday.

“I think when we can show
Pittsburgh [that] students can vote as a
block.They’ll listen to us and our ideas,”
said Jennifer Karch, the Government
Relations Committee recruitment oﬂicer.

She said that is the reason SGB made
an effort to attend.

A majority of the crowd at the
armouncement was comprised of senior
citizens. Karch said that when a candidate
looks out into the crowd and doesn’t see
the faces of younger constituents, they
won’t focus on the younger constituent
vote or what those constituents have to
say.

Keith Campbell, another SGB mem-
ber at the announcement, agreed with
Karch.

“We have to show [candidates] that
students are a power,” said Campbell.
“Our objective is not to support any can-
didate, but show that students are a fac-
tor.”

The SGB representatives described
themselves as “observers,” interested in
rallying the student voice.

Karch said she hopes to gain a greater
recognition of the student voice in city
politics by showing students a different
side of politics.

“If there was more [student] interest
in city politics, Bigelow wouldn’t even
have been an issue,” said Karch.

Campbell said that SGB will be be
turning their words into action in April
when they plan to run an “absentee ballot
day” and voter registration drive for stu-
dents on campus. He also said SGB hopes
to get candidates to be at these locations
to talk about the issues and rally student
interest.

Karch, who lives in Florida, re—regis-
tered to vote in Pittsburgh because she
wants to have a voice in the matters she
says affect her the most. That, said Karch,

is the concept behind SGB’s initiative to ‘

get the govemment’s attention.

“It’s in the students’ best interest to
re—register,” she said.

The next step is to get students out to
vote, according to Karch.

Campbell said that by getting 50 per-
cent of the student body to vote, the city
government would listen, but only about
20 percent voted in the November elec-
tion.

Karch said that the city level cam-
paign is to show city council that student
voters are interested in the issues.

in their ﬁelds, proﬁles of their faculty and
graduate students, and anything else they
could think of that might help their cases.

“It was really vague as we went in,”
said Dan Everett, the chair of linguistics,
in category ﬁve. “There wasn’t much

guidance given in the types of questions.

that would be asked.”

Each department chair in categories
four and ﬁve was given half an hour to
make a presentation to the committee.
Category four departments spoke last
Sunday. The category ﬁves met
Wednesday night.

Provost James Maher has said he
would like to see more cooperation across
department lines. D.L. Ashliman, chair of
the German department, said that many of
the committee’s questions had to do with
the amount of cooperation that already
exists between departments.

Ashlirnan also said that there were
talks about “cooperation” going on
between all the language departments,
including English, a “quality core”
department, or category three.

“The German department is certainly
in full agreement that cooperative efforts
are called for, and not just to save money.
In many instances, cooperation makes
good sense,” he said.

Many departments said they were
unsure about criteria used to rank depart-
ments.

“I didn’t feel that the meeting was
hostile,” Everett said. “I don’t ﬁnd the
process unreasonable at all, given the
ﬁnancial situation of the FAS, and com-
ing up with a plan to ‘streamline where
possible.

“It’s just that as a department chair,
it’s not always clear what criteria I’m
being judged by. This has been the most
frustrating part for‘ all of the smaller
departments — not knowing how we’re
to be judged  sometimes evaluated on
graduate programs, sometimes under-
grads. It’s never clear exactly how we’re
being evalua .”

Everett said that the linguistics
department is ranked 24th nationally by
one poll and 26th by another. The com-
rnittee asked why others were higher in
those rankings and why Pitt’s department
is small, according to Everett.

“We have 41 graduate students. By
design, the majority of those are master’s
students,” Everett said. “There just aren’t
enough jobs for tenure-track positions, so
we felt this way was better.”

‘ Everett also said thatthose master’s
students usually end up teaching English
abroad or in public schools.

Gill said she did not understand why
classics was placed into category four.

“We’ve very cost-effective,” she said.
“We teach a lot of undergraduates. We
appear to make 51 percent more than we
cost. It seems silly to go cutting their rev-
enue-raising programs. So we don’t
understand what they’re doing. We have a

vigorous graduate program; it doesn’t
make sense to me.”

Most department heads said that,
despite the number of humanities depart-
ments in the lower categories, the pro-
ceedings were fair.

“I’m sure our perception of what we
do is different from the category ﬁve [rat-
ing],” said Stephen Coleman, chair of the-
ater arts. “It’s just a matter of prioritiza-
tion. We believe that theater is central to
what the University is about and what
FAS is about.”

Ashlirnan agreed. “Given the circum-

- stances, I recognize that the University is

facing hard ﬁnancial times, and that
undoubtedly some reorganization will be
necessary,” he said.

Birnbaurn said that Koehler and the
committee were trying to do the best they
could within the time frame allotted.

“I don’t want to say it’s been unfair,”
Bimbaurn said. “I am truly convinced the
administration is trying to.be fair.”

Gill disagreed, saying that originally,
category four was to be a holding catego-
ry and that in September, Koehler assured
her that classics would be “safe.”

“Suddenly, it was reversed, and I
don’t know why  I don’t think they’ve
been fair,” said Gill. “We’ve been
extremely frustrated with they way things
have been handled.”

Departments also expressed concern
about errors in the information that the
committee had been given. According to
Bimbaum, departments found discrepan-
cies in the materials that Koehler gave
them, which came from the meeting with
the PBC.

Birnbaum said the speed of the pro-
ceedings increases the chance that a deci-
sion will be made with “inadequate”
information. Bimbaum and others said
that just looking at the number of degrees
could lead to “profoun ” cuts in small
departments.

“Cuts to small departments are much
more dangerous than to large ones and
dangerous to the whole quality of the
University,” Birnbaurn said. “I don’t see
large departments being asked to make
similar contributions or any contributions
at all. But at the same time, I haven’t seen
that they aren’t going to be asked to do
that.”

In a seven-person department, elimi-
nating one person removes 14.29 percent
of that department. In a 58-person pro-
gram, only 1.72 percent is lost.

Birnbaum said that departments
shouldn’t be spared based solely on size,
though. “If our departments aren’t good,
they shouldn’t be saved just because
they’re small,” Birnbaum said.

Most departments said they agreed
with the need to streamline the FAS, but
they all urged caution.

"I‘here’s so much at stake here,”
Birnbaurn said. “If you close a Ph.D. pro-
gram, who knows if you'll ever be able to
reopen rt.”

JFK blown away, what else
do we have to say? Plenty

Cyril Wecht, who is the Allegheny County Coroner and
a consultant for the American Academy of Forensic
Sciences on the case of the Kennedy assassination, spoke at
Pitt last Wednesday night about the questions which remain
unanswered regarding the Kennedy assassination.

We have to agree with Wecht that the report of the
Warren Commission left a lot to be desired.

Is it humanly possible that Lee Harvey Oswald acted
alone? According to Wecht, ﬁrearms experts determined
that it takes at least 2.3 seconds to shoot, reload, and ﬁre the
weapon Oswald used, a Mannlicher-Carcano riﬂe. The
Zapruder ﬁlm shows the length of time between shots to be

. x-.,.-.4».-0.» ».v>o»../. .. - - - .

1.5 seconds. Yes, Oswald was a marine, but he failed his ’

first marksmanship test and only got a C+ on his second
one.

Wecht also raised questions about how the body was
handled after Kennedy was pronounced dead. According to
Wecht, the body should have been autopsied in Dallas
before it was moved to Bethesda Naval Medical Center.
Once at the medical center, Wecht does not believe that the
most competent individuals were chosen to perform the
autopsy.

Wecht_ raised many questions Wednesday night; it is
long past time for the government to answer them. The
speculation regarding‘ the Kennedy assassination need not
burn on forever like the eternal ﬂame over his grave.

Even the Kennedy family has_ called for the complete
disclosure of the ﬁles.

The Kennedy assassination occurred on November 22,
1963. It is now 34 years later. The time has come for all of
the information surrounding the assassination of the 35th
president of the United States be released for the public to
decide whether or not the truth has been told.

THE PITT NEWS

 

Dear Food Services: ‘

My name is Anthony
Breznican, and I am a junior at the
University of Pittsburgh. I have
lived in the residence halls and
eaten in your cafeterias for three
years. I am very familiar with the
service and product you offer stu-
dents, so I feel I’m also qualiﬁed
to recommend my brother, Greg,
for a summer job in your facili-
ties. I think he is exactly what
you’re looking for.

My brother can’t cook worth
a damn. I’m serious. He can’t
even pour himself a bowl of cere-
al. My mother tried to teach him
how to make grilled cheese sand-
wiches once, and they went
through 64 slices of American
cheese and two loaves of
Wonderbread before the neigh-
bors saw the smoke and called the
fire department.

I have seen the way your
workers cook perfectly good food
until there’s nothing left of it but
char or mush, and I’m conﬁdent
my brother can boil or burn it with
the best of them.

Greg will make sure the pizza
in Schenley Cafeteria stays
gummy, the pork in Manchu Wok
continues to be a festering bowl of
blood-red fat and crust, and that
the Burger King sandwiches are
as dry and hard as old dog dirt.
Basically, my brother can contin-
ue with the proud Marriott tradi-
tion of making miserable food for
miserable Pitt students while
being as miserable as possible
himself.

He also has an attitude.

As his older brother, I’ve wit-
nessed him in his most omery of

Monday, February ‘I0, 1997

Anthony Breznican’s brother Greg: punk kid, r ture Marriott employee of the month?

Dear Marriott: please hire my brother

moods, and I know that he can be
as rude, crude, and disgusting as
any of your workers. Judging
from my experiences in your cafe-
terias, this is an important skill for
him to perfect. I’m sure he’ll be
willing to learn from your veteran
employees. He may have a thing
or two to teach them, as well.
One time at dinner, I had to
ask him six times to pass the
mashed potatoes. When I asked
him a seventh time, my dad
slapped him across the back of his
head. “Somebody’s talking to

you!” he said. Greg got so pissed 1

off that he threw a salt shaker at
my head and broke the clock on
our kitchen wall. It is this type of
self—assertiveness that will beneﬁt
you and your entire staff.

. It seems to be Maniott policy
to leave some remnant of yester-
day’s dinner on all the plates in

the cafeterias. I have had personal .

work experience with my brother
while cleaning dishes in my
home, and can guarantee he will
leave asubstantial amount of crud
on the plates and silverware in
your establishment, too.

The way I see it, my brother
was born to work for you. Give
him a Marriott hat, a spatula, and
an inﬂated wage. There is nothing
he cannot ruin. Admit it —— you
can’t help but hire him. You’ve
got the money. I mean, students
pay more than $5.00 for a
“Block” that’s worth $4.50. If the
estimated 4,192 students living in
the residence halls eat two meals a
day in your establishment, then
you get more than $8,000 daily
for doing nothing but throwing a
glob of slop in a hog trough.

To be honest, you get a lot
more money than that for doing
nothing. After all, students don’t

get change for meals that cost less
than the $4.50 of allotted block
money. If we only count the Fall
and Spring semesters, you make
more than Two Million Dollars.

Surely, you can spare mini-
mum wage for my brother.

He’s graduating from high
school this year and needs to
make some cash for college. He
may even come to Pitt, so you can
look forward to stealing that
money right back from him next
year! I’m telling you —— hire him.
You can’t lose.

While he may not be the
worst cook or the nastiest worker
you employ, he would make an
excellent contender. I recommend
him very strongly for any position
you have open. In fact, I might
even recommend him as your new
director. He can talk his way
around almost anything, convince
you he’s NOT ripping you off,
and make you think he really
cares about what you say when he
isn’t even listening.‘

So, please consider Greg’s
application carefully. He is eager
to join the Marriott family.

Sincerely,

 

P.S. Oh, I almost forgot!
Mam'ott’s contract is up at the end
of this semester, isn’t it?

If it isn’-t renewed, please con-
sider this application and recom-
mendation void. Things are likely
to change, and I’m not sure my
brother would be right for the job
anymore. -

Anthony Bremican still plans to run
for President of the United States.

The Democrats have a plan that ”Pennsy|vania _(_?_a_I_1_!”

 
 

[Editor's note: the guest columnis H.
William DeWeese, is the PA House of
Representative is Democratic Leader]

‘Twas brillig and the slithy tove
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves
And the mome raths outgrabe.

So begins Lewis Carroll’s
“Jabberwocky,” and it makes‘ about as
much sense as recent speeches by Gov.
Tom Ridge defending his administra-
performance in managing
Pennsylvania’s job creation programs.
The governor includes just enough
familiar words to make his audience
think he is saying something, but when
you look closely at the record, it does-
n’t say much.

In his speeches, Gov. Ridge claims
that Pennsylvania lost jobs during the
administration of his predecessor,
Democrat Robert Casey. But according
to the monthly publication,
Pennsylvania Labor F orce, which has
Torn Ridge’s name on the cover, that
assertion is false. Gov. Ridge also
claims that he believes his approach to
economic development is working.
According to his own reports, that
assertion is also false.

Republicans Cut Job Growth in

 

Half. The truth is that Pennsylvania
today is producing new jobs at less
than half the rate we were at just two
years ago. In the last 22 months of the
Casey Administration, Pennsylvania
had a net increase of 133,400 new
jobs. In the ﬁrst 22 months of the
Ridge Administration, the increase has
been only 62,000 new jobs.

That’s a whopping 71,400 fewer
jobs V for working people in
Pennsylvania in just two years. To put

that in perspective, 71,400 new jobs‘

could eliminate unemployment in the
12 counties with the highest unem-
ployment rates.

“Pennsylvania Can!” — A
Democratic Alternative. For
Democrats, nothing is more important
over the next two years than getting
back on the right track before job
growth grinds to a complete halt in our
Commonwealth.

That is why House Democrats
have proposed a new strategy for job
growth called “Pennsylvania Can!”

' Democrats have always believed that

we could best attract business by pro-
moting our strengths, by strengthening
education for both children and adults,
and by targeting state resources on
communities that most need help in
creating new jobs.

“Pennsylvania Q!” does all of

that and more in four speciﬁc ways.

1. Pennsylvania @ build on our
regional strengths. Every region of
our state has specific industries with
some of the best cutting-edge busi-
nesses in the nation. These include

wood products in the northern tier; '

printing, metalworking, and tourism in
the northeast; powdered metals, food
processing, and transportation in our
central counties; pharmaceuticals, bio-
medical, frnancial, insurance, and real
estate in the southeast; plastics and
tool and die in the northwest; and fab-
ricated metals, primary metals, and
industrial machinery in the southwest.

2. Pennsylvania can make job
creation efforts smarter, not bigger.
We can build our regional strengths
because new businesses will know that

-there is a pool of trained and skilled

workers already on the job.

The quality of the work force is
critical to business, and “Pennsylvania
Qa_n!” puts a renewed focus on educa-
tion. This means high academic, voca-
tional, and technical education stan-
dards. It means tax credits and incen-
tive funds for vocational-technical
schools, in partnership with business,
to upgrade school equipment. And it
means a comprehensive examination
of our $750 million in job—training
funds to ensure that we get real results. ,

3. Pennsylvania can help com-
munities most in need. “Pennsylvania
ﬁn!” sets aside a portion of current
state funding to help distressed areas.
The proposal includes providing tax
credits and re-directing savings from
welfare reform to invest in private-sec-
tor day care, transportation, and skill
development programs. .

“Pennsylvania Can!” also creates a
$100-million bond program to capital-
ize on 20-50 community reinvestment
funds at the local level, a strategy that
has proven successful in Detroit and
other distressed communities.

4. Pennsylvania gr; form suc-
cessful partnerships. These include
public-private partnerships, at both the
community and regional levels, to pro-
mote business expansion. It also
includes partnerships with schools to
improve the academic and technical
skills of graduates and to .transfer

research into practical application.

within business.

Pennsylvania _c_a_r_r_ do all of these
things, but first we must recognize the
manifest needed to change course.
Until we do that, our economic well-
being is in peril-, and we should heed
Lewis Carroll’s plainly worded advice:

Beware the Jabberwock, my son,
The jaws that bite, the claws that
catch.

 

 

Is conservatism dead? Pretty much. I
know with that statement, I have probably
convinced a number of people that I am
nuts, but it is true. For the most part, the
die-hard believers of the conservative ide-
ology no longer exist. Now, I bet a lot of
people are probably saying: “Wait a sec-
ond. The Gingrich—rooted agenda may
have been repudiated by the voters last
November, but it is still the engine that dri-
ves the GOP, and the last time that I looked,
they weren’t exactly liberals.” True
enough. Perhaps I should explain what I
mean when I say that conservatism is dead.

By conservatism, I am talking about
the belief that government should have a
virtually nonexistent role in our lives. So
who ﬁts my deﬁnition of a real conserva-
tive? The only individual I can think of is
Republican icon Barry Goldwater, the for-
mer senator from Arizona.

“I have little interest in streamlining
government or making it more efficient, for
I mean to reduce its size,” Goldwater wrote
in his book, “The Conscience of a
Conservative.” He added, “I do not under-
take to promote welfare, for I propose to
extend freedom. My aim is not to pass
laws, but to repeal them.”

Goldwater, who in 1964 had the unfor-

tunate distinction of being on the business
end of the worst drubbing a Republican
presidential candidate has received since
Alf Landon in 1936, was a conservative’s
conservative.

An anti-communist and a strong
believer in individual freedom, Barry
Goldwater served with distinction as a
member of the United States Senate for
decades. He was a conservative in the
truest sense — a man who exalted the free-
dom of the individual over
the state. It is disappointing
to hear Republican politi-
cians make the claim that
they are conservatives when
they are plainly not.

So what about Reagan’s
1981 tax cuts and Gingrich’s
attack upon the federal gov-
eminent in 1995? Weren’t these things part
of the conservative revolution? True con-
servative David Frum says no and explains
why Reagan’s policies were not really con-
servative in his 1994 book, “Dead Right.”

“No more ﬂinty frugality. Rather than
ﬁght and lose the battle over the welfare
state for the 100th time, Reagan would
change the subject from spending to taxes.
Later, after the tax cuts had worked their
magic, there would be plenty of time to
start chopping the excesses of big govem-
ment.”

By censervotivisnt,
I am talking about
the belief that
government should
have a virtually
nonexistent role in
our lives.

But that didn’t happen. Why? When
things got down to business, the “conserv-
atives” decided not to rock the boat. Frum
noted in his book: “The major domestic
spending programs — Social Security,
Medicare, aid to farmers and to veterans --
are all highly popular, ironically, with the
Republican party’s core constituencies.”

It’s kind of funny when you think about it. »
For all of their yelling and screaming about .

big government, the Republicans have left
its foundation pretty much
untouched.

Even while the
Republicans moaned about
the size of the federal govern-
ment during the 1980s, they
were asking Congress
(allegedly controlled by a
group of sadistic liberals bent
on armihilating western civilization) to
allow them to spend money that was not in
the budget. The “liberal” Democrats in
Congress ended up lopping a total of $16.1
billion out of Reagan’s budgets. That’s
right — the “liberals” stopped the “conser—
vatives” from spending taxpayers’ money. I
guess Rush Limbaugh was more right than
he knew when he said that Ronald Reagan
was “a man to whom we Americans owe a
debt we will never be able to repay.”

The conservatives of the Republican
party today would like to use the govem-

Goldwater is the last real article in a world of liberals in conservative clothing

ment to carry out their objectives rather
than have market forces as the primary
instruments of change. Pat Buchanan, for
example, would love to build a barrier
around our industry and our values to keep
“threats” to America’s security (read:
Japanese, Mexicans, etc) out Jack Kemp
wants the federal government to solve the
problems of the inner-city by issuing eco-
nornic programs and tax credits to compa-
nies that hire workers in the inner—cities.
Moralists like Pat Robertson, Ralph Reed,
and Bill Bennett, want the government to
step in and regulate moral behavior. This
sort of government interventionism is hard-
ly “conservative.” Instead of laissez-faire,
the Republicans have joined the Democrats
to become the party of interest group
activism.

I think that it is time we retire words
like “liberal” and “conservative.” They just
don’t mean the same things that they used
to. If conservatism is the idea that individ-
ual freedom is desirable above all else, then
who is the bigger supporter of individual-
ism —— the “liberal” who supports a
woman’s right to choose an abortion or the
“conservative” who wants the government
to step in and interfere with that woman’s
right? Think about it.

Michael Berquist thinks that the labels
of “conservative ” and “liberal ” are irrele-
vant and outdated.

Big East refs
ruin Pitt
game, again

    

It amazes me how Pitt, a team that
really doesn’t do anything especially well
on offense except shoot threes, can be so
pathetic from the foul line. They better
improve in a hurry, because if games are
going to be ofﬁciated like Saturday’s game
was, teams will be visiting the line a lot
more often.

There were 53 personal fouls (plus
two technical fouls) called in Saturday’s
game — the second-highest total in a Pitt
game this season. At the postgame press
conference, the very ﬁrst thing that Seton
Hall Coach George Blaney pointed to as a
problem for his team was foul trouble.
While Saturday’s game was the most bla-
tant case of referee incompetence, it wasn’t
the ﬁrst that Pitt has seen this year.

Officials have bad days. Sometimes
they just don’t see the fouls. Likewise,
some oﬂicials are just naturally trigger-
happy. Remember the oﬂicials ﬁom the
game a few weeks ago when St. John’s vis-
ited the Field House? They blew the whis-
tle at anything that moved, as if they were
ofﬁciating a Big Ten game. There were
only 39 fouls in that game, but tliat’s
because Pitt had the decency not to foul in
the ﬁnal seconds, thinking they had a
chance to score ﬁve points in 3.2 seconds.
The problem with that game was that
things like travelling were called on every
other possession. Some calls were proba-
bly justiﬁed, but most were not.

Even if those kinds of petty calls aien’t
justiﬁed, you can prepare for it. You can be
extra careful and still have a good basket-
ball game. But when you get officials like
the three stooges who ran the show
Saturday (Mike Kitts, Curtis Shaw, and
Leroy Hendricks), there’s going to be trou-
ble.

Panthers win
toullest over
Pirates, 79-7'I

Eric Mosley

 
 

The win wasn’t pretty. But at least it was a win.

'Ihat’s how most of the 6,674 fans that attended Sa1urday’s Big
East matchup between Pitt and Seton Hall felt after watching what
was arguably the sloppiest game the Panthers have played all season.

The Panthers pulled it out, however, avenging their early season
loss to the Pirates despite their shaky play. The 79-71 win raises Pitt’s
record to 6-6 in the Big East and 12-11 overall.

‘This win wasn’t pretty, but this time of year is grind-it-out
time,” Head Coach Ralph Willard said “It’s amazing how fragile
team egos are, and we’re still a little tentative in some areas, but I
think a game like this will give us some conﬁdence.”

The Panthers looked like they were off to a fast start after 6-foot-
7 senior forward Chad Vaiga threw down a two—handed dunk on
Pitt’s ﬁrst possession, but turnovers and numerous fouls plagued
both Seton Hall and Pitt, resulting in a sloppy, low-scoring ﬁrst half.

Sophomores Vonteego Cummings and Mark Blount got into
early foul trouble, forcing Willard to go to his bench. Cummings was
replaced by freshman Leon Murray, who continued the sloppy play
by air—balling a foul shot, and Blount was replaced by 611 senior
forward Gerald Jordan.

One player who was ready to play Saturday was Seton Hall’s
junior guard Levell Sanders. Sanders hit ﬁve three-pointers in the
ﬁrst halfalone and ﬁnished the game with 28 points.

VVith 8:41 left in the ﬁrst half, Pitt trailed the Hall, 11-9. Senior
guard Jason Maile ﬁnally broke the Pitt scoring drought at 7:55 with

Lady Mountaineers take the Backyard Brawl

Howard scores 27 in Pitt’s ninth straight Ios

The Pitt Lady Panthers
dropped their ninth in a row to the
West Virginia Mountaineers, 95-
86, in the highest-scoring Pitt
women’s basketball game of the
year.

For the second game in a row,
Pitt gave up a new season high in
points to their opponents. They
gave up 84 to Georgetown on
Wednesday.

On the bright side, the Lady
Panthers also scored their season-
high of 86. Their previous high was
81.

West Virginia’s win evened the
all-time series at ten wins for each
team.

Pitt Head Coach Kirk Bruce
said, “West Virginia is a different
type of team. We were able to
score.”

The story of this game was the

 

 

Howard, Pitt’s junior center, and
West Virginia’s junior guard,
Talisha Hargis. Both had monster
games, and led their respective
teams in scoring.

The honors for Howard began
in a pregame ceremony when she
received a blue and gold basketball
for scoring her l,O()0th point last
week at Rutgers. Coming into this
game, she had scored 1,037 points
to take possession of ninth place on
Pitt’s all-time scoring list.

After the game began, it was
apparent Howard did not want to
stay in ninth place for long. She fm-
ished the game with her tenth dou-
ble-double of the year and third in a
row. Howard netted 27 points and
grabbed 12 rebounds in a losing
effort.

Unfortunately, Howard’s 27
points were overshadowed by her
ﬁiend Hargis’ 33. She totally dom-
inated the Lady Panthers. Eighteen

of her 33 points came from the foul
story of two friends —— Latia

Women swimmers prepare

for Big East Championships

Matt Townsend

 

The life of a swimmer is one of dedi-
cation and focus. They swim up and down
a pool a million times with one thought in
their goggle-wrapped heads — the sea-
son-ending conference meet.

In Big East swirmning, the entire year
climaxes at the conference championship
meet, which will be held at Rutgers
University on February 19-23.

In this meet, all season records are
thrown out, and every team is equal. There
are no perks for an undefeated season,
and, just the same, a winless team isn’t in
the disadvantage. It’s quite simple. Each
team puts their 17 best in the pool, and
from there anything is possible.

“Anything can happeniat this meet,
and that’s what is so exciting. We could go
in and have a great meet and really sur-
prise some people,” said head coach
Marian Cassidy—Keen.

Now the Pitt women’s swim team is
in their taper phase of training. Tapering is
a reduction in yardage swum in the last
two to three weeks before an important
meet, so the team will peak for the Big
East Championship.

“It gets us fresh for the Big East so we
can go out and get our best times. We

focus to put up our best times at one meet,
and the Big East is it,” said Keen.
Pitt ﬁnished sixth last year, which was

the lowest ﬁnish by a Pitt women’s team j

in the 13-year history of the Big East. This
year the team went 4-7 in dual meets and
ﬁnished strong with a win against

. Duquesne University. The Panthers strong

dual meet schedule had them racing
upper_—echelon teams each weekend. They
faced non—league opponents like North
Carolina and Ohio State and also swam
against last year’s Big East champion
Vrllanova.

“We are ready to have a great meet. It
could be hard to break into the top couple
of spots, but from third all the way down
will be a great race,” said Keen.

The Pitt freshmen could make the dif-
ference in the meet. Diver Jamie
Tomazich, who has filled in for an injured
Buffy Smith, has excelled this year and
hasn’t been challenged in many meets.
However, she will face formidable Miami
divers. Beth Grube could make some
noise in the backstroke, and Liz Peny’s
butterﬂy gives her the opportunity to be at
the top. 1

“Jamie has done a great job stepping
up her diving this year. She has some
national experience, and that will help her

freshmen in men's final meet

   
  

           

The Pitt men’s swimming and diving
team defeated Duquesne 171-77 Saturday
in their last meet this season as a team. It
was also the last meet at Trees Pool for
Pitt’s three seniors.

In a ceremony before the meet, tri-
captains Josh Heynes, John Soulakis, and

Mike Speerschneider were reco ' by
their coaches and teammates for, eir four
years of dedication and leadership.

“The three guys had an emotional

impact on the team,” said‘ Head Coach

Chuck Knoles. “Mike is a great emotional
leader, and so is Josh.”

Diver Soulakis provided more than
emotional leadership for the team. “John
brought a lot of unity between the swim-
mers and divers because he understands
what each one goes through,” said Knoles.

Heynes and Soulakis have qualiﬁed
for the Big East Championships Feb. 19-
23 at Rutgers, but Speerschneider partici-
pated in his last collegiate meet at Trees.

“I’ll miss the camaraderie and being
part of something,” said Speerschneider,
who has led the team in overall grade-

point average in each of his four years.
“But I’m ready for it to be done.”
The lower-caliber Dukes allowed

some of Pitt’s less experienced swimmers

to get their feet wet.

The freshmen participated in and won
many events. The top three ﬁnishers in the
100-meter freestyle were Regan Drew
(47.38), Tim Tallman (47.87), and
Brendan Lupetin (48.04). Jeremy
VanEpps (10:17.06) and Jerry Koller
(10:39.03) took the top two spots in the
10()0 freestyle, and Brian Elko won the
200 IM (1259.59). In the 50 freestyle,
Koller took first place (21.67), and Drew
captured second place (22.21). Michael
Pron ﬁnished second in the 100 breast-
stroke (1200.68), and Elko, VanEpps,
Drew, and junior Bob Nooning won the
200 medley relay. Freshmen Michael
Eisenstein, Aren Faruq, Drew, and sopho-
more Brett Collins participated in the 200
freestyle relay.

In other events, sophomore Adam
Kotkiewicz, Nooning, Koller, and another
freshman, Andy Cherep, took ﬁrst place in
the 200 freestyle relay (1:26.72). Junior
Pete Hezky won the 200. backstroke

The story of the 1996-97 Pitt basketball
season has followed the pattern of a roller-
coaster ride all year.

Up one week, down the next World-
beaters for a couple of games, doormats for
the next few.

On Saturday, the Panthers took every
hill and valley that has exempliﬁed their sea-
sonandcrammeditallintooneafternoon
with a 79-71 victory over the Seton Hall

’ Pirates at Fitzgerald Field House.

Chad Varga anchored the Panthers with
19 points, with a few oorning in an exciting
fashion.Hethrewdownadunkonthe
Panthers’ very ﬁrst possession, and his alley-

Seton Hall Head Coach George Blaney
took special note of Varga’s strong perfor-
rnanoe.
“I think the diﬂerenoe with the last time
we playedthem(a 53-51 Pirates’ winon Dec.
8) was that they didn’t have [center Gerald]
Jordan and Varga,” Blaney said “Varga espe-
cially played really well today.”

Fellow Panthers Vonteego

was the outstanding play of Pirates’ junior
guard Levell Sanders, who led all soorers

Monday, February 10, ‘I997

“Levell Sanders had a great game for
us,” said Coach Blaney. “He really came out
alive scoring, rebounding, and defending.”

Aside from Sanders’ timely shooting,
the Panthers’ own ineptitude, especially at the
ﬁee-throw line, kept this game close. Pitt shot
28 for 50 from the charity stripe for the game,
with an atrocious 3-12 in the ﬁrst half.

“Free—throw shooting was very bad,”
said Coach Willard, who quickly added, “But
we did some really good things defensively.”

The question for Pitt now is: Can they
overcome their inconsistencies in time to put

“Everybody goes through slumps,”
Chad said “Hejustneeds to keep shooting.”

Both Varga and Willard agree that the
Panthers’ last few games will go a long way
in deﬁning their season.

“It’s a very important stretch [oorning
up].Wehaveto1eamhowtowinonthe

Varga added, “VVrth four at home, we
need to get ‘em all.”

‘The challenge tonight was to out—work
[Seton Hall]. We just played to win harder
than [they] did”

The next challenge that awaits the
Panthers is Big East powerhouse Vrllanova,
who visits Fitzgerald Field House this
Wednesday night.

Both Varga and Jordan missed the ﬁrst
meeting between the two schools because of
injury, but led the Panthers to a victory
Satmday.

“I think the difference between the last
time we played them was that they didn’t
have Varga and Jordan. Varga especially
played really well,” Seton Hall Head Coach
George Blaney said. “Pittsburgh did a pretty
good job nraking steals and just harassing us
out there.”

The Panthers led 32-28 at the half,
despite shooting only 43 percent from the
ﬁeld and just 25 percent ﬁom the ﬁee-throw
line.

When Pitt needed a big play in the sec-
ond half, they looked to Cummings or Varga,
and the two players didn’t disappoint. VV1th
17:45 remaining, Cummings leaped over

 

Seton Hall’s Levell Sanders with a one-hand-
ed jam that gave Pitt a 38-32 lead. On Pitt’s
next possession, Varga soared through the
lane and slammed home a two-handed shot
that ignited a quiet crowd.

However, Seton Hall would ﬁght back
and keep the game close with a lot of help
ﬁom the Panthers. Freshman Kellii Taylor,
who shot 2-9 from the ﬁeld Saturday and 3-
28 in the past three games, was called for a
technical foul at 11:07 forhanging on therim.
Ifone technical was not enough, 6-foot junior
Kevin Willard, would provide another at the
6:47 mark

The Panthers hit several timely free-
throws down the stretch to seal the victory.
Varga ﬁnished with 19 points, Cummings
with 16, Maile added 15, and Gerald Jordan
scored 12 points and grabbed 16 rebounds.

"The last time we played them, they got
every loose ball, and they just out—worked
us,” senior guard Jason Maile said. “But
today, we out-worked them.”

Volleyball

-The Pitt Panthers have inked
three high school seniors to national
letters—of-intent for the upcoming fall
season.

Two of the players, Karen
Reisiger and Stacy Renick, were
named to Volleyball Magazine ’s 50-
player national all-star squad.
Reni_ck’s Minnesota Northern Lights
Volleyball Club was the nation’s top
club team in 1996. She was also a
Minnesota Academic All—State pick.

Reisiger, the tallest of the new
recruits at six-foot-two, is a middle-
hitter out of Vestal High School in
New York. She played for the Volley

Express Volleyball Club.

The third recruit, setter Lisa
Riggle, is considered one of the top
seniors at her position in the country.
She was twice selected All-State from
Campbell County High School in
Wyoming. Riggle led her school to
two state championships.

The three standouts should
improve a Pitt team that reached the
Big East Championship game" last
season. V .

Boxing

-Lennox Lewis won the vacant
WBC Heavyweight Title Friday night
in Las Vegas with a controversial
fifth-round TKO of Oliver McCall.
McCall, who has a history of drug

and alcohol abuse problems, stopped
defending himself in the closing sec-
onds of the third round, and refused
to return to his corner after the bell.
He threw a total of two punches in the
fourth and returned to his corner cry-
ing after the end of the round.

In the fifth, after Lewis landed a
battery of punches on his unwilling
opponent-, .referee Mills Lane
stopped the bout. McCall would not
talk to reporters after the fight, but it
is suspected that the fighter had some
sort of nervous breakdown between
the ring ropes. The Las Vegas State

Athletic Commission is withholding

McCall’s purse, in excess of $3 mil-
lion, until a hearing on the fight is
held.

Pro Basketball

-Thanks to a near—perfect score
on his first dunk in the final round,
18-year-old Los Angeles Laker Kobe

Bryant won the 1997 NBA Slam ‘

Dunk Competition. The rookie scored
49 out of a possible 50 points by
passing the ball between his legs in

midair and executing a perfect wind—'

mill-style-dunk finish.

-Steve Kerr earned yet another
title for the Chicago Bulls this week-
end, winning Saturday’s NBA Three-
Point Shootout. Kerr defeated last
year’s winner, Washington Bullet
guard Tim Legler, in the finals to
claim his first Shootout win in his
fourth contest appearance.

line. When the Lady Panthers tried to put
a guard on her, Hargis would post up and
score inside. If a forward ended up cover-
ing her, Hargis drove to the basket. No
matter what she did, she got fouled.

Howard said of her friend, “We need-
ed to play her before she got the ball. She
was pounding it to us.”

Bruce explained that Pitt could do
nothing to stop Hargis. He also said, “You
have to give her a lot of credit. She had a
great game. We could just not stop her.
People just don’t score 33 points on us.
Nobody has yet.” .

The game started off very slowly for
the Lady Panthers. The Lady
Mountaineers were up 13-7 at the 15:53
mark. West Virginia ran out of steam,
though, and JoJo Guzman tied the game
at 22 with a driving layup. Guzman drove
past ﬁve Mountaineers before getting
right to the hoop for the basket.

After freshman Michelle Katkowski
hit two free throws, Pitt had their first lead
of the game, 24-22. From this point to the
half, the game was a seesaw battle.

Just at the end of the half, West
Virginia hit a jump shot to pull within one,
39-38. Bruce took this one point for the
topic of the biggest part of his halftime
speech.

The best play of the ﬁrst half for Pitt

was their inside play. They dominated
West Virginia in the paint.
' Bruce said that the ﬁrst half went
[Pitt’s] way” in the paint. He pointed to
the play of Howard and junior center
Farrah Woods.

In their last game, the Lady Panthers
had a lot of trouble with Georgetown’s
press, but the same did not hold true yes-
terday. West Virginia’s press was just a
pest for Pitt.

“When we got overzealous, thinking

we could break it every time, we turned
the ball over,” said Bmce of the WVU
defense. “If we could have broken the
press every time, you know how this
game would have turned out.”

West Virginia jumped out to a ﬁve-
point lead early in the second half. They
were led by a three-pointer from ﬁve feet
behind the are by Hargis. In the middle of
the half, though, Hargis went out with an
injury, and once again the Lady Panthers
fought back to get the lead at 50-49.

At this point in the game, Hargis
came back, and West Virginia took con-
trol. They took a 71-56 lead in the next
seven minutes to put the Lady Panthers
away for good. After this rim, Pitt could
not come back again, and they lost the
game by nine.

Pitt had a lot of trouble on the glass.
West Virginia was able to get a lot of sec-
ond-chance baskets. Pitt also committed

 

 

FROM PAGE 11

fouls which allowed the Lady
Mountaineers easy hoops. West Virginia
shot 88 percent from the charity stripe in
the second half, missing only three shots.

“We have to block out ﬁrst and then
get the rebound instead of just trying to
get the ball,” said Howard of the team’s
rebounding effort.

The Lady Panthers, on the other
hand, shot only 46 percent from the foul
line in the second half.

This loss drops Pitt to 2-10 at
Fitzgerald Field House and 2-11 in the
Big East. They have only two of their ﬁve
remaining games at home. The Lady
Panthers play host to Boston College and
St John’s in the last week of the season
before going to Connecticut for the Big
East Tournament.

Pitt also has to travel to number one-
ranked Connecticut, Seton Hall, and
Miami to complete their schedule.

/ In a game where the normally mild-
mannered Kevin Willard picks up a techni-
cal foul, you have to suspect that some-
thing has gone wrong. The “something” in
this case was the fact that the ofﬁcials sim-
ply lost control of the game.

The crowning moment came with
3:32 left in the second half. Chad Varga
came down with a rebound and got
mugged underneath the basket. In that
case, a foul would have been justiﬁed.
Instead, a jump ball was called. Fine. They
blew the call.

At that point, there was a media time-
out. The oﬂicials spent the entire timeout
trying to explain to Ralph Wllard what
was going on. By the time the timeout was
over, not only had the oﬂicials still not got-
ten things straightened out with Willard,
but Blaney was also in on the argument. So
the refs not only blew a call, but they made
themselves look utterly incompetent in
front of thousands of people, as opposed to
most of the game before this incident,
when they only looked mildly incompe-
tent.

Oﬂicials need to know what they’re
doing. They don’t necessarily have to do it
well all the time, but they have to know
what they’re doing. Otherwise, the chaos
that happened Saturday will be just the tip
of the iceberg.

against the Miami divers,” said Keen.

Keen knows that for her team to have
a good meet, it can’t depend on a couple
of swimmers. She is conﬁdent in her
team’s unity and their ability to swim
well as a team.

“I want everyone to swim well and
get best times. We need everyone to have
a great meet, not just a few people,” said
Keen.

The team hit its stride this weekend
with a close loss to Ohio State, 164-136,
and a trashing of Duquesne 166-101. The
Buckeyes won the ﬁrst three events until
Grube won her speciality, the 100—meter
backstroke, in 58.90. Junior Erin Bissel
then followed with a four-tenths of a sec-
ond win in the 100 breast, 1:08.68.

Tomazich won again in the 1—meter and
3-meter dives. She was challenged by
Ohio State’s Carrie Ziebarth for one of
the few times this season, winning by
only ﬁve points in the 1-meter. Perry won
the 100 butterﬂy at a 59.45, only half a
second ahead of teammate Jenny Banks.

“We swam well. They are a strong
team, and we went out and put up a
strong meet against them,” said Keen.

For some of Keen’s swimmers, the
Duquesne meet on Saturday will be their
last. Pitt can only take 17 swimmers to
the Big East meet, so 10 have to stay
home and wish their teammates good
luck.

“This year was the hardest decision

thing for me, but this year everyone was
supportive and understood that they are
part of something whether they get to go
or not,” said Keen.

Freshmen Wendy Marold and
Melinda Koser and junior Leslie Becki
ended their seasons against Duquesne

with victories. Marold won the 200

freestyle with a 1:56.15, Koser won the
100 freestyle at 54.57, and Becki was a
triple winner in the 100 breaststroke
(1208.32), 200 breaststroke (2:27.52) and
the 200 individual medley (1208.32).

“It was great to see them ﬁnish like
that. It got everyone pumped up and
ready for the Big East,” said Keen.

and Lupetin (1:45.l2) ﬁnished 1-2 in the
200 freestyle. Speerschneider ﬁnished
third in the 200 M (2:06.28).

“It was a low-key meet, so everyone
got to swim in events they usually don’t,
without the pressure of having to win the
meet,” said Knoles.

Last year, Soulakis ﬁnished second in

he’ll have this summer to reach another
one of his goals.

“I’m going to swim across Lake
Erie,” he said with a grin. ’

Although Heynes has the Big East
Championships, and Soulakis has the Big
East Championships and the NCAA
zones (regional qualifying) remaining,
they realize the end of their careers is get-
ting closer.

“It really hasn’t hit me yet,” said
Soulakis. “I don’t know what I’ll be doing
at this time next year. Usually, I know
what I’ll be doing this time of year.”
