He had a story to tell, but was 
in no mood to write coherently. "

We listened with copy paper, pen-
cil, and eagerness.

Faithful dance—goers, he de-
clared, are assessed ‘$31.50 ap-
proximately for the following

On Voc-aétions
Will Be Held

In response to the .s-preadi-ng,
interest. in vocations for wom-3
en, the 1.-Tl’ll\'(}l"Sl-l-3' \Volnen
Self — Goverl.lme.nt Association]
this year has organized a voca-';
tional information committee. 

"Under the chairmanship of Dor- 
othy Dering, C39, and working in
co-operation with Miss Frances
McLaughlin, assistant dean of
women in charge of employment,
the committee has three main
purposes:

To make women on campus vo-
cation-conscious; to aid those who
cannot decide on a vocation; and
to assist :those.women who have
already chosen a vocation by,
showing them the opportunities or.
disadvantages of the ﬁeld they
have chosen.

Plans for the year include the
presentation of prominent speak-
ers from all parts of the ‘country
who have consented to talk on
vocations open. to women. The first
of these speakers will address up-
perclass women Friday, October
15. “Further details will appeal:
in later issues of The News.

Miss Dering’s committee, com-,
posed of an equal number of’
sophomores, juniors and seniors, is
made up of the following:

“And so . . .?”

“And so the darn business‘!
amounts up to something like sev-I
enty-ﬁve dollars, all told, lsansl
frat dances. You know, they’re:
trying to rush me again, for the;
fourth year.” ' 

“And what are you going to
do?”

“Well, I’ve got a date tonight.”

Evolution Sans “R”

Scientists from Canada and the
States meeting at a regular ses-
sion of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science
several years ago agreed unani-
mously to the resolution that,

“The theory of evolution (as
developed by Darwin) is one of
the most valuable’ and fruitful of
all scientific generalizations and.
is therefore accepted as valid.’’

‘‘ What their resolution meant
was simply that they accepted
the premises and conclusion of the
much-misunderstood scientist, al-
though, with scientiﬁc acumen,
they could not agree completely
upon several of the complex and
interrelated details.

Their disagreement, however,
gave the layman, backed by little
science, less acumen, an ODDOYW‘
nity to peek at what he called
“Darwill’s monkey theory.”

. Recent throwback to evolution-
ary dispute is the case of Penn-
sylvania’s Mrs. Laura Elms lVl__or-
ris, Waynesburg high SCh001
teacher. Mrs. Morris has been
charged with the encouragement
of ,spit—ball hurling, with kicking
and beating her youthful students
with a baseball bat, and with):
teaching evolution. 4

The ﬁrst two charges, if true,
are culpable. If, as is reported,
the teacher taught her students
that man is merely an overgrown
monkey, she was misinformed.
Man, according to accepted gene-
alogical trees,‘ grew concurrently
with the anthropoid apes, the two
families splitting back in the Oli-
gocene Age with Piltdown as one
of the ﬁrst of the family of men,
Propliopithecus as ﬁrst of the
monkeys.

But if the teacher had said that
man was derived from a micros-
copic unicellular animal, preced-
ing both man and monkey in the
tree of development, she could not
have been blamed. Still, one won-
ders why an amoeba should be
more concerting to the human be-
ing than a chimpanzee.

At any rate, she was dismissed.
If it was true that she encouraged
spit—balls and whacked her charg-
es, well and good. It is was noth-
ing more disturbing than that she
taught evolution . . well!

Dr. Daugherty.
'Schedu<l-ed To Open
New Series Friday

Dr. Carroll R. Daugherty, pro-
fessor of-. economics, will address
the ﬁrst meeting of SFA-sponsor_-
ed Student Faculty Forum‘ to be
held at 12:45 o’clock, Friday, Oc-
tober 8.

Presenting the report of the
committee at the inaugural SFA
meeting last -'l.‘.»uesda«y, Milton G.
Lehman, ~Jr., C39, chairman, indi-
cated that the policy of the group
this year will be to present promi-
nent members of the faculty in-
formally before members of the
student and faculty bodies.

“Our aim,” he said, “is to at-
tempt to break down the barriers
between the student and the pro-
fessor, to achieve through these in-
formal mectings a closer relation-
ship between the two groups. Fur-
thermore, students will be given
the opportunity to hear and be-
come acquainted with faculty
members they would not meet in
the course of their classes.”

At test sessions held last April
and May, Dr. Samuel H. Williams,
professor of biology,_and Dr. Wil-
liam T. Root, dean of the Grad-
uate School and professor of psy-
chology, addressed students.

Meetings this year will be di-
vided equally between the presen-
tation of the address by the speak-
er and an open forum ‘conducted
for the audience bythe speaker.
Forums will be held every other
week during the school year.

The subject for Dr. Daugherty’s
address and the number of the
room for the meeting will be an-
nounc_ed later. ,

Campus Vote Favors   7
Football Subsidization

Should college athletics be sub-_
sidizedor not? ‘-  ‘

R’everberating.i throughout the
nation the question arises in lieu
of the growing realization on the
‘part of university administrators
and the public that the old-fash-.
ioned college football, where the
players were recruited from the
student body proper and from
local steel mills has given
away to a new type of sport in
which the participants are re-
cruited from high schools on the
basis of playing ability, and ten-
dered scholarships, ~e'xern'pt‘ions,
“-jobs,” -etc., to perform on the
gridiron.

‘Today, University students give
ther answer.

Campus Opinion, Pitt News
student poll covering the College,
School of Business Administration,
School of Engineering and School
of Education, was inaugurated last
Monday in an endeavor to dis-
cover the attitude of the student
body on this much- discussed is-
sue.

Six queries were put to students
ﬁlling out the questionnaires the
ﬁrst of these being: “Do you in
general favor the practice of
most universities of extending to
good high school football players
extra inducements in the form of
scholarships, exemptions, “jobs,”
etc., in order to persuade them
to attend -that particular school?”

ANSWER “YES”

Vigorously and emphatically,

students answer "‘Yes” to the

‘question, 72 per cent answering in
the afﬁrmative and 28 per cent in
the negative. Freshmen voted 66
per cent against,~34 per cent; soph-
omores 82 per cent against 18 per
cent; juniors 76 per cent against
24 per cent; and seniors 69 per
cent against 31 per cent. -7

Taken by schools, the vote runs:
in the College, 74 per cent against.
26 per cent; in the Business Ad-.
ministration school, 92 per cent.
against :8 ‘per cent; in the Engi-
neering school, 7—1;per cent against
29 percent.

Most unusual of the ‘results’
came from the Séhool -of Educa-
tion, which is predominantly fem-
inine in enrollment. “The ques-

tion in that sector was answered’!

on a—50-50 basis.

Dividing the vote on the basis
of men and women, it was found
that the men in the University fa-
vored “extra inducements” by 79
per cent to 21 .per cent, while the
ladies said “yes” only by a mar-
gin of 63 per cent to 37 per cent.
That is to say, a larger percentage
of women are “opposed to the
common athletic practice than
men. V

“Do you believe athletes should
be paid outright salaries?” sec-
ond question -on the "list, re-
garded as of secondary importance,

by the editors, "gains a marked 
assent from the student body by’

67 per cent to 32 per cent. rBy.

News Setup Changed

The following is :a. statement from the faculty-adtmi-nistmtrion
members of the Publication Board,‘-arrived at yesterday. Editor and
business manager of The Pitt News, -ex-oﬁicio members, were not
consulted or asked to be present when the decision was reached.

" ‘Reorganization of the editorial setup of The News reflective
with this issue ’-has been made upon recommendation of the Pub-

.lication Board.

“Under the new arrangement, all copy will be reviewed by
’the*‘fa.-culty adviser with the editor. This plamis, essentially ‘the
same as ‘followed by -a. number of universities in the East -and
‘Middle West -and will result in improvement both -in qu‘a.1i«tya—n-d

-content of material published.
"‘ Criticism -of ‘news _stories

and editorials and columns both

last year and in recent "weeks by students, faculty, and ‘alumni
has shown that quality of ‘material published under the old plan
of complete student direction needs improvement.

“It is hoped .that, under the new setup, .the..,publication may
be continued three times each week. This will depend upon im-
provement shown in writing and cooperation and enthusiasm

The folloulmg is a. letter of resignation from the -editor of The
Pitt News to the Publications Board:

September 30, 1937

I-Ierewith is tendered. my resignation as editor of The Pitt
News, oﬂicial student tri-Weekly newspaper of the University
of Pittsburgh, to become effective immediately upon publica-
tion of Volume XXIX, Number 7, and to remain effective until

today is rescinded.

I consider the “reorganization” merely censorship in the
fullest sense, out of all sympathy with the aims of true educa-
tion and in direct opposition to a sincere policy of interest in
student welfare which The Pitt News has maintained this year

It is my wishthat, in consideration of student interest in
student welfare, you will immediately reinstitute the policy of‘
‘a free student newspaper that has been followed in the past.

Sincerely, .

‘hall should park on both sides of
‘Parkman avenue, the right side of
Alumni drive going up, the right-
hand side of Bigelow boulevard
‘from the Twentieth Century club
to Tennyson avenue, and on the
‘Bigelow boulevard side of the S01-
diers’ and Sailors’ Memorial.

ACUTE PROBLELVI

The most acute part of the park-
"ing problem involves parking
space for people having classes in
3the Cathedral. It is therefore
most important that all those who
drive to school and have their
classes in the Cathedral‘ ﬁll out the
question blank on this page. For
if the poll shows that there are
more people driving to school than
there are parking spaces availa-
ble for, an effort will be made to
provide more adequate facilities.

Places now available for stu-

dents with classes in the Cathedral,

are as follows: along the portion
of the Bigelow boulevard side of
the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memo-
rial, with parking on one side on-
ly and perpendicular to the curb;
parking on both sides of Bigelow
boulevard opposite the Hotel
Schenley, perpendicular to the
curb on the Cathedral side only;
both sides of Fifth, Lytton and
Tennyson avenues, and both sides
of Belleﬁeld avenue.
CONVENIENT PARKING

The two most convenient park-
ing places, from the standpoint of
nearness to the Cathedral and
ease of getting in and out, are at
present free from congestion; the
ﬁrst of these being the large park-
ing space provided by the city,
bounded by the Carnegie Library/,
Forbes Field and the Foster Me-
morial. This space, with room for
more than 150 cars, is accessible
to the Cathedral from the Forbes
street entrance.

Another parking place availa-
ble at present for Cathedral stu-
dents is the lower portion of Bus-
kin Field (ROTC drill ﬁeld) op-
posite the Heinz Chapel. There
is a possibility that this will not
remain open indeﬁnitely for stu-
dent parking, but when and if this
occurs, students will be notiﬁed
through the pages of The Pitt
News.

Students are requested to ﬁll
put the ballot at the bottom of
-_t_h-is page. Poll boxes are placed
in the lower elevator lobby, and
at the Fifth avenue entrance for

the convenience of voters.

local facilities inadequate.

CONCERT HOURS

sored by the concert hours com-
mittee, and printed in the last is-
sue of The News, was outlined by
Robert Brown, C39, chairman.
Milton G. Lehman, chairman of
the Student-Faculty forum com-
mittee, then reviewed his commit-
tee’s plans for a series of meetings
with faculty speakers, which ap-
pear elsewhere in this issue.

VVilliam Hoeveler, C39, chair-
man of the newsreel theater com-
mittee, presented his resignation,
which will be acted upon at the
next meeting of the SFA execu-
tive committee.

Reporting on the activities of a
committee to investigate inclusion
of the eugenics and euthenics
course in the College curriculum,
William Stark, C38, stated that
the course conducted last semes-
ter by Dr. Auleen M. Jamison, di-
rector of the Women’s Student
Health Service, had been highly
successful, according to students
enrolled.

Because the College catalog had
been prepared before the eugenics
course had been tested, it was im-
possible to include it in the curric-
ulum this year, -Stark said. He ex-
plained that he believed, after
consulting with Dr; Jamison and
Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women,
that some provision for sex educa-
tion should be provided.

Stark then introduced a motion,
passed unanimously by the assem-
bly, providing that an SFA com-
mittee should be appointed to con-
fer with deans of the schools of
the University about the advisabil-
ity of requesting the American
Social Hygiene association to pro-
vide experts in social. hygiene to
lead student seminars on sex edu-

_ cation.

Strong Mountaineers Face

A
V _ 1

Panthers In   Morgantown    

Glenn  
Sends Veterans
Against Pitt
There’s a1 clan of lanky riflemen

stalking around those West Vir-
ginia foothills. They’re out Pan-
ther-hunting and from the gleam
in their shotguns they reckon
they’ll trap their prey.

For those who are not up on
their mountain lore, the feud we
refer to is one of the oldest in
backwoods history, second only to
the Martins and the Coys. It’s
been going on for about 36 years
between the West Virginia Moun-
taineers and the Pitt Panthers.
Tomorrow, in Morgantown, they
renew old arguments on the West!
Virginia gridiron.

Back from the cleaners, the
leather-fringed Mountaineer shirt
looks better than ever. Marshall‘
“Sleepy” Glenn succeeded Trusty
Tallman as football high man last
summer and his Mountain men
look almost as strong on the foot-
ball ﬁeld now as they were when
Glenn was playing.

LETTERMEN BACK

Glenn has 13 lettermen back,
all of them tried and true Veter-
ans, and he added some of the
stars of his own. great freshman
squad who went through last sea-
son unbeaten. As a result, Moun-
taineers who started against Pitt
last time and who played through
the season, have lost their places
to the sophomores.

Sam Atty, Oley Hedrick, Dave
Volkin, and Paul Hodges, will
start in the line again tomorrow.
The only notable absentee is Babe
Barna, the ﬁne pass receiver. Two
new ends, Spud and DeAngelis
and Dick Dolly will be at the
terminals instead. Fred Nebere,
a starter last year, will be on the
bench.

Dolly is taking the place of the
great Barna, and this means
catching Kelly l\/Ioan’s perfect
passes. Moan is the sure-ﬁngered
gentleman from Long Beach who‘
is a real forward passing attack;
in himself.

At quarterback for ‘ailie Glenn-
men will be Tony Raspaswick, a
mighty good hurdler during the
spring track season. Harry Clark

Pitt-West Virginia — S l e e p y

3Glenn has a wide-awake team

this year. They may help open the
Panther’s eyes. Glenn’s own unde-
feated frosh are sophomores now,
ﬁlling in the few places that aren‘t

and Sam Audia will round out the
Mountaineer backﬁeld.
OFFENSE CONCEALED

While it is apparent that Glenn
has something there, no one
knows really what it is. In beat-
ing the West Virginia Wesleyan
Bobcats last week, the Moun-
taineers used a very limited of-
fense. In fact they didn’t show
more than eight different plays.
They did show a stout defense and
gave the impression that they had
a potential attack that is as strong
as Mammy Yokum.

Getting into the buses this af-
ternoon, the Panthers will go to
Uniontown where they will stay
over night, leaving for the game
in the morning. There will be a
few changes in the starting Pan-
ther line-up.

Dante Dalle Tezze has gone
back to the ﬁrst team in his old,
familiar guard position. Don
Hensley is also back among the
starters. The big center, a native
of West Virginia, will probably
serve as acting captain tomorrow.

Pulled muscles have hurt the
scrimmage sessions of Bill‘ Daddio
and Curly Stebbins, but appar-;
ently both will be able to begin
the game. Fabian Hoffman, back
with the team, will make the trip.

Tomorrow’s game will be the
thirtieth in 36 years of football
between the two schools. Pitt has
won 24 of the games; West Vir-
ginia has only received winner’s
credit for three, the others being!
ties.

GO TO DETROIT

Olsorrwill have a wide gap. to

Tost, number one man. Others
included the high placing combin-
ation of Alex Leggin and George.

med the Lions, 25-30 in an excit-
ing meet. It was the ﬁrst time in

The Mountaineer offense is un-

three. Just the same this will be
far from being another Cassiano
cake-walk. -

Race Entrants
Swamp Olson

There aren’t so many track nov-
Stadium
track oval every night that there
isn’t room for a few more. But
there are more entrants to date in
Coach Carl Olson’s sixth annual
novice track and ﬁeld meet, than
there ever have been at a com-

7 parative date in the history of the

affair.

The novice tournament will be
run on the Stadium cinderpath
October 20 and 21. All of the reg-
ular track and ﬁeld events will be
run off. Entrants may enter any
of the various events, but may not
enter more than three.

Entry blanks will appear in The
News and should be ﬁlled out and
returned to Coach Olson in the
Stadium Office.

Boys entered in the meet should
meet Mr. Potts in the Stadium at
4 o’clock any afternoon when he
will issue equipment and help the
individual competitiors to get into
shape.

Among the boys entered to date
are Al Butch, Theodore Stanish,
Clyde Grof, Lawrence Tregon-
iny, Lawrence Katz, Delwyn An-
derson, Albert Boulanger, Joseph

I ‘ Hahnel, Paul Roden, Fred Horner,

William Nurmi, Edwin Ammer-
man, and Tom Guza.

Green Panther Cross Country

Squad Meets Purdue Tomorrow

Every coach has his ups and.‘

downs and Carl Olson is not the
exception that proves the rule.
Right now Mr. Olson*is way, way

down.

The hill and dalers of Purdue
will be in town tomorrow to meet
the Panthers on the four-mile
Schenley Park course tomorrow
morning at ten o’clock. Purdue
is a member of the Big Ten where
they turn out plenty of good cross-
country teams.

But it isn’t Purdue that has
Olson staying awake all night. The
Panthers have met and conquered
tougher cross-country opponents
than the Boilermakers. It’s the
fact that Olson’s perpeutal motion
squad is lacking in experienced
material. The boys are very, very
green.

Al Zamborski is the only one of
the six starting runners who ran
with Harold Tost, Alex Leggin,
Johnny Woodruff, and Frank Bo-
noroti on the ’37 squad.

Woodruff who went to Japan
this summer as a member of an
American track team touring the
Land of the Sun should be back
sometime next week, but the Boil-
ermakers will have returned to
Gary by then.

Olson will probably build his
squad around Zamborski with
Casimir and Ben Copec, John
Emens, ‘Robert Cogswell, and Bob

Sepic completing the outfit. How-‘

ever, he may make some last min-
uate changes in his starting sex-
tet and start either Ken Gust or
Joe Kristufek, and possibly both.
Excluding Zamborski, none of
these boys have ever been entered
in varsity competition and when
they start off against the Boiler-
makers, Olson wil have his ﬁngers
crossed and hope that among them
he may ﬁnd a winner or two.
Among ‘the green material, the
Kopec brothers have been show-

ing the best form throughout. the
short two-weeks’ training season.
Although they never ran a cross-
country race, they were on the

track team last year and Olson

hopes that if he keeps his ﬁngers
crossed long and hard enough
Casimir or Ben may come across
the ﬁnish line ahead of the pack.

About Purdue Coach Carl had
little to say except that, “This will
be the ﬁrst time that we have had
the Boilermakers on our schedule,
and remember they are in the Big
Ten where they really know some-
thing about running cross-coun-
try.”

uwhooooo wants to buy;an-Owl?” ..is the general
hoot these days as we do our daily Alpine-climbing
.in the Cathedral.

After attempting to sell editor Idella Rome’s
1938 brain—chi1d to about ten people and discover-
ing that they, too, are selling them, webecarne dis-
couragedand sold one to ourself.

We whipped down to the Photo-Reﬂex Studios
in Gimbel’s where, as Miss Rome said, “Four poses
are taken, and the studio set-up is such-that the
subject sees himself as the camera sees him.”

Which is really very delightful.

First of all, a charming young lady greets you.
‘Then she deposits you in a little cubby-hole behind
a swaying curtain where you are to don aflowered
smock if you are a woman and a tuxedo if you are
not a woman.

You beam nonchalantly at yourself in the mir-
ror and proceed to comb .the knots out .of your
touseled locks. With chin thrust forward you then
admire your -nose. You may even wrinkle it if
you want to.

If you forget your lipstick they have tiny lip-
sticks there for your use . . . if you want to get
hoof-and-mouth disease or something. Ah, now
you are ready.

You emerge from your little nook clutching your
flowered robeandmanage a sprightly grin as the
mice photographer sneaks up on you. Sitting gin-
gerly upon a chair on which you are supposed to
-sit up straight, you are a bit abashed when the gen-
tleman suggests that you drop your smock. But he
deftly sticks a peach transparent velvet drape on
your shoulders before you and your shoulders have
stopped blushing, and there you are!

When the exhausted but amiable photographer
ﬁnishes pushing your chin down if you are a
thruster-upper—chinner like us, he retreats behind
his four cameras or whatever and hides. You won-
der if hexhas perhaps felt a suspender slipping. But,
no, 'theI'e'he is. He "wants you to smile.

You -eke out what is probably an eye-crinkling
smirk.  he whoops with delight behind the
jim-crackies. You can imagine him clasping his
hands with pleasure, if you want to.

There are three more sessions. You can really
[see yourself as the camera sees you. ‘We hope the
camera is a big ﬁbber. For the last three poses
we ‘definitely looked like Captain Bligh, Zazu
,Pitts, and Freddie Bartholomew respectively, as
well as respectably. 2 ,

Does anybody want~to buy an Owl? “Think of the,
fun you’ll have! (You’re ‘welcome, Idella.) “

Very Young.

As you, my children, wait, so once did we;
and when we heard dear Papa’s heavy tread
upon the stairs we asked, as you asked me,
“Kin we please see the funnies?” But I dread,
I really ‘dread and "fear the consequence

of giving you -this -frightful “comic sheet”:

its worldliness will blast your innocense,

its theme and composition aren’t discreet.

It used to be the “funnies,” but the fun

has gone.‘ It’s preseritscope is life and death
and sordid intermediates. Begun

as: humor‘, now it draws its livingwbreath 
from misery. My heirs hear this-j’accuse:

‘ “Do you ‘believe that systematic
exploitation of football at a given
university. necessarily hampers ‘the
development of, and interest in. 8
comprehensive recreational Pro‘
gram at that institution‘?_”_ ‘was re-
marked by one réspohdent to be
“the fundamental question in the
lot.”

And apparently, the student
body after deliberating over this
question has concluded that com-
merciaized athletics as detrimental
to a comprehensive recreational
program.

illowpstudents can feel thus and
yet answer questions one and two
by hearty yeas may prove some-
thing of a poser, but it is believed
possible that the.__iaiajority consid-

ered the questions from a differ-

ent point of ‘ view, the ﬁrst two
from a practical, and the third

from a philosophical; or, secondly,

that the majority believe big-‘time

athletics in which the student is
spectator to be more -desirable

than the development of A a‘ com-
prehensive recreational program in
which he can actually take part.

It is suggested falso that thema-
jority of students did not .tie up
the three questionsﬂandpsee their
relationship, ‘so are “therefore not
quite sure what they think.

Although Mexico connotates

C. Amundsen, professor of his-

tory at the University, who ‘visited’

.Mexico this summer.

“The average American’s con-

. ception of Mexico is superﬁcial,"

commented Dr. Amundsen. In-
stead of living the carefree life of
the dime novels, ..the‘peons live in
ﬁlth and,.p‘overty.

‘Since the "workers in the cities
are for the most part unionized,
