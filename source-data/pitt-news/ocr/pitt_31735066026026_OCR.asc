BAS President Aisha Anderson read her name
that she didn’t even ﬁnd out how close the race
was.
“I don’t know the count,” she said late last
night “I was just to happy to ﬁnd out the vote.”

Senior Esrick McCa1tha had a very differ-
ent reaction when he found out he was elected
BAS vice president. He was calm and remained
as composed as he was throughout the election.

“I had a conﬁdent feeling the whole day,”
said McCartha, who defeated sophomore
Donnie Yawn.

DMZ protests Iraq situation

with wrestling and speech

Jason Gallinger
Staff Writer

A peaceful protest at Carnegie Mellon
University Wednesday turned violent when
Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky provoked
each other into a wrestling match.

The two actors in the mock confronta-
tion, Bill Frizlen and Elise DeLucca, cen-
tered their argument on Lewinsky’s demand
that Clinton back down from his hard—1ine
stand of economic sanctions against Iraq and
the U.S. military presence in the Persian
Gulf.

“You’ve brought enough ‘shame to the
country with your affairs,” the Lewinsky
actress shouted.

But when Clinton refused to lift the sanc-
tions and withdraw the troops, he _and
Lewinsky exchanged blows. Lewinsky was
the victor, and the alleged girlfriend forced
Clinton to give in to her demands.

While the antics in front of Doherty Hall
amused passing students, they underscored a
serious point.

The Pittsburgh Dernilitarize Zone, a local
anti-war activist group and sponsor of the

_ protest, voiced outrage over an economic

embargo in place against Iraq since 1991 and

President Clinton’s threats of a military.

strike. The DMZ also arranged to have Iraqi
Professor Abas Ali of Indiana University of
Pennsylvania deliver a speech in the

Clinton and Lewinsky duke it out WWF-style

Cathedral of Leaming later Wednesday
evening.

“It’s unfortunate that the only way to get
people’s attention is with wrestling matches
and shouting,” said Vincent Scotti Eirene of

the Pittsburgh DMZ.

The situation in Iraq is serious enough to
warrant everybody’s attention, he said.
Because of the sanctions, over 1 million
Iraqis have died in the last seven years.

Protester Cecelia Moriarity felt the
United States had an ulterior motive for
threatening to strike Iraq. The real reason,
she said, is not a threat posed by Saddam
Hussein’s arsenal of weapons.

“I -think the U.S. is driven to attack Iraq
because of a need to establish a subservient
regime there,” she said. “The U.S. needs that
regime to control the region’s resources and
exploit the labor.”

As scheduled, Ali» spoke to about 50 stu-
dents and members of the community.

“The United States willuse any opportu-
nity to justify a military strike on Iraq,” he
said. The intention, he said, was to maintain
instability in the region so the United States
could more easily exert its inﬂuence.

Ali said President Clinton makes deci-
sions based only on. the advice of experts
who equate the Arab world with terrorism.

“The advisers —— whose only qualiﬁca-
tion is that they’re not Arab —'— are intent only-
on humiliating the Arab people,” Ali said.

Staff Writer

Pitt’s, associate athletics director
said college athletes spend so much
time on the field or court that they
have little time to plan for their
careers.

Donna Sanft said that even when
athletes aren’t vying for a place in
professional sports, many are still so
dedicated to practice and their teams
that they miss career fairs and may
need more help preparing for life
after college.

6 To help resolve this problem, the
Athletics Department sponsored its
own career fair along with Pitt’s
Placement and Career Services. The
event was held last night in the
Fitzgerald Field House with over 80
professionals available for students
to talk to.

The career fair was held later in
the evening so that athletes who usu-
ally ‘miss such events because of
practice could attend, Sanft
explained.

“Our students often miss out
because of practice. Our first
thought was our student athletes
could benefit. We immediately real-
ized that it could ..be helpful to all
students.”

Few of the professionals at the
event represented sports-associated
businesses. Many were lawyers or
journalists, but a sports psychologist
and sports nutritionist were also pre-
sent to talk about their professions.

“It’s an opportunity for students
to talk to people who are established
and successful . in their careers,”

Sanft said. ,

Many of the representatives were
former Pitt students, and nearly half
of the presenters were former stu-
dent athletes, according to Pitt ath-
letics spokesman Ron Wahl.

Dave Ciafre, a parole officer,
graduated from Pitt in 1991.

“It’s nice to give back to the
University, and I’m glad to help peo-
ple out,” he said.

Sanft said she thought the career
fair was a “big success.”-

“I think it’s been great. Everyone.

is busy walking around and ‘talking
to people,” Sanft said.

She described the career repre-
sentatives as “a lot of great people
who are happy to help students.”

“Students who ‘are undecided

about their major could get ideas to:
think about since every presenter is‘.-
different,” she said. “More focused-;
students could talk to someone in the:
career they are heading into and get:
tips on how to be successful or tips’:

on how to get a job.”

Freshman Shantel McCoy said;
she came to the fair because shejj i
thought it would be a good opportu-E»
nity to network and to meet profes-7

sionals.

“It was helpful to talk to some-i~
one who’s already been through what?

I'm going through now,” she said.

Other students, such as junior’
Louis Gruver also said they received

information to prepare for life after
graduation ’

“It helps you hone in on. where}
you want to be and what you want to 1.

do,” Gruver said.

Daniel said the colleges will also
look to improve enrollment in fields
where minorities are traditionally
under-representedand in fields that
would be most beneficial to the black
community. '

‘ “[These include] any discipline
that is quantitatively based,” he said.
“For example, the natural sciences,
health sciences and other applied sci-
ences, such as engineering, business
and computer science.”

Pittsburgh public schools’ minor-
ity students have shown a decline in
according to
Daniel. This is a problem because
calculus provides the background for
all quantitatively based fields, he
said. .

School of Engineering Dean
Gerald Holder said he assembled a

-committee to evaluate minority-help
programs and to address new ways to ’

keep minorities enrolled through
graduation. He said the committee is
due to present the report .to him on

ing the group was not competently
addressing black students’ needs.

“Due to the lack of vision and creativ-
ity by BAS’ administration and support,
BAS has almost been reduced to a black
Pitt Programming Council, and a nominal
representation of black students on cam-
pus,” said Jay Woodson, a senior and BAS
member.

Other students said BAS members
need to take a more active role on campus,
saying its purpose as an organization is
unclear to other students.

“When is the Action in Black Action
Society going to start?” said Marquette
Bowman, a fonner SGB member.

The new BAS leaders say they plan to
motivate current members and encourage
new people to get involved with the group.

They also plan to better coordinate the
organization with other campus groups.

McCartha said the BAS will concen— '

trate on uniting Pittsburgh minority leaders
with blacks on campus. .

“['Ihe BAS will also] become more of
an information station where students can
be involved in knowing the ins and outs of
the resources that are available to them
here at the University,” he said.

Ogunleye said she and McCartha will
try to coordinate their efforts to “relieve the
tension and stress among the African-
American students on campus.”

“We want to reach out and extend to
African-American students before they
even decide to come to PitI,” she said “So,
whenthey decide to come here, they feel
comfortable and at home.”

minorities feel more comfortable in
the engineering program, contributes
to Daniel’s objectives, according to
Holder. '

The committee will discuss the
program and make any improvements
that may be necessary. It will also
brainstorm ideas for new programs
that might address aspects of minori-
ty education not covered by the exist-
ing programs. '

Holder said he will do anything
possible to meet the recommenda-
tions of the committee.

If the changes don’t require any
financial support, he said, he will
implement them immediately. But if
they can’t be achieved without addi-
tional money, they will be imple-
mented next year, according to
Holder.

Holder said the School of
Engineering’s official 1997-98 statis-

tics showed there are 96 black under- _

graduate and 14 black ‘postgraduate
students. This compares to 1,398
white undergrads and 680 graduate
students.

Holder said these numbers are

not perfectly accurate because enroll-V V
ments ﬂuctuate almost daily because

people change majors often.
He said the
Engineering’s student population is 7
percent minority, equal to the nation-
al average for engineering schools.

“But there’s still time to grow,” .
he said. ‘ A
' Frederick Winter, dean of the,
College of Business Administration ;
and"the _Katz Graduate School of 3
Business, said he tries to recruit ‘
minority students. But no matter how E
many these schools recruit, this never ;‘_
significantly improves the number 2
they have enrolled because so many 

minority students drop out.

To combat this, Winter said the 
CBA is trying to set up a help fund 
for minority students. This fund 

would provide financial aid from
both University and private sources.

_ “We’re concerned about minority -
students who may have to leave the
University for financial reasons,” I’

Winter said.

Winter‘ said the CBA is also con-
sidering a program that visits high 
schools with minority students. They 
will talk to the students whom the 
high school determines are most like- 3 ‘
ly to pursue a business major in col.- 

lege. '

The _CBA representatives would 
then talk to the students about differ- "
ent aspects of the business major. But A
that’s still a year or so away, accord— 

ing to Winter.

He said he would also like to be:
able to offer financial aid to any of
those students who decide to come to

I Bringing Einstein down
I from the heavens to put
A his feet on the ground

As a child, John Norton transformed
his parents’ basement into a chemistry
laboratory.

And when he was in high school, he
asked his parents to buy him a thick book
about organic chemistry. Once they did,
he carried it around constantly, reading it
every chance he had.

His early love of science led him to
become what he is today: an expert on the
work and papers of Albert Einstein.

Norton is a professor in the history
and philosophy of science department at
Pitt and teaches many classes in under-
graduate and graduate programs. In addi-
tion, he’s designed a few classes of his
own, including the Einstein for Everyone
course, an elective for students not major-
ing in a science ﬁeld.

His extensive knowledge of
Einstein’s papers makes him the perfect
person to teach this class.

“He is one of the handful of people
who really know the Einstein papers
inside and out,” said Peter Koehler, dean
of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

Norton is one of a small number of
people who have read Einstein’s original
papers, and he is one of about 10 people
in the world who are recognized experts
on a collection of Einstein’s papers called
the “Zurich Notebook.” Norton himself
named the collection after the fact that
Einstein wrote it while in Zurich,
Switzerland. Norton was actually the ﬁrst
person to become an expert on these
papers.

There are very few authorities on the
subject because most people don’t have
the time or the curiosity to go through the
massive quantity of papers that Einstein
wrote, explained Norton.

In 1979, Norton began reading the
volumes — written in German — which
recorded Einstein’s discovery of the
General Theory of Relativity.

He read them seeking information for
his graduate dissertation about the link
between gravity and the space-time con-
tinuum. Einstein’s theory of this link
helps to explain why the earth revolves
around the sun in exactly the way it does.

Basically, Einstein’s theory says that
the force of gravity stretches and squeezes
not just matter, but space itself.

“That kind of seems like science ﬁc-
tion when you hear it,” mused Norton.

Norton became curious to understand
what the theory meant and how someone
could actually discover something like
that.

“That really got me moving,” said
Norton.

In the middle of his research, Norton
came to the section of Einstein’s papers
that he now calls the “Zurich Notebook”

and was struck by a 5
note in the margin 5?
signifying that 5
Einstein knew
there was a rnis-

§
- El’
take in the §

ered, but the
fact that
Einstein had
known this
i n tr i g u e d
N o rt 0 n ,
who made this col-
lection his chief area of research.

Norton discovered that, though the
equations in this early paper of Einstein’s
had led to a wrong answer, Einstein actu-
ally wrote the right answer but didn’t
know it and kept going in the wrong
direction — a mistake which kept
Einstein from ﬁnding the right theory for
several more years.

Since that discovery, Norton has
spent years studying and editing the
“Zurich Notebook” for the volumed pub-
lication of Einstein’s papers which other
authorities now turn to for their research.

But spending time as an expert
researcher hasn’t compromised Norton’s
teaching one bit, say his fans. He’s made
the time to develop a course on Eir1stein’s
work which is accessible to more than just
the experts.

The Einstein for Everyone course,
Norton says, is exactly what the title says
— for everyone. It is intended for people
who know who Einstein is but don’t
know what he did or what his studies
mean. '

“It’s quite a mind-expanding course,”
said Norton. b

He created the elective course

because he noticed he was constantly

THE PITT NEWS

teaching
about Einstein to peo-
ple in classes who
were just trying to ful-
ﬁll a requirement.

Norton said that
when he was in college, he would have
jumped at the chance to take a class like
this, saying, “Wow! A course on Einstein.
That sounds like fun.”And apparently,
Pitt students have jumped at the chance.
According to Koehler, the class has been
extremely successful.

“He takes the enthusiasm that he
clearly has in his research and brings it
into the classroom,” said Koehler.

Norton wasn’t always interested in
the history of science. His undergraduate
degree from the University of South
Wales in Sydney, Australia, is in chemical

engineering. He became intrigued with

philosophy during required courses in
college.

Norton said ﬂrat most people in the
history and philosophy of science enter
the ﬁeld late in life, after studying science.

“It’s very hard to do history of sci-
ence if you don’t know what the science

is about,” said Norton.

Norton’s love of philosophy led him
to begin the graduate study of it at the
University of South Wales.

Though many think he is one of the

most prestigious professors in the depart- -

ment, Norton remains humble and says he
is only one of many in the department. In
fact, Pitt’s History of Philosophy and
Science Department is rated as the best of
its kind in the nation and is home to some
of the world’s leading experts on the sub-
ject.

“I came to Pittsburgh because of
that,” said Norton.

At the moment, Norton is working on
a variety of projects, in addition to teach-
ing his classes.

For one of- his projects, he and col-
league Jonathan Bain, also a Pitt profes-
sor, have been ' writing a paper entitled
“What Should Philosophers of Science
Learn From the History of the Electron,”
in which -they discuss and critique current
research on electrons.

Norton is also working with Robert
Clifton in creating the philosophy of
physics section of the on-line “Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy.”

The fact that he is so active in
research, and is carrying his expert
knowledge into undergraduate teaching,

has brought Norton a lot of respect from

colleagues and fellow Pitt faculty mem-
bers.

“[Norton] is, to me, a wonderful
example of what it means to have" a
research-active faculty member in an
undergraduate classroom,” said Koehler.-

up and
nowhere to go

Students first.

That's one of the war cries Steve Pederson
has coined for his Athletics Department. Funny,
though — students seem to be last.

Take, for instance, the men's lacrosse- team.
Even though it plays varsity teams from other
schools, Pitt's team is a nonvarsity club.

The club is organized by students, main-
tained by students, and ﬁnanced largely with the
students‘ pocket money. Participation is purely a
student activity. None of the team members is
getting an athletic scholarship for playing.

But they have no place to practice or play.

Because the team is not a varsity sport, sanc-
tioned and paid for by the Athletics Department,
it gets lowest priority when scheduling for a
room or facility. For example, before the
lacrosse team, priority for the Cost Center's
facilities goes to varsity sports, educational pro-
grams, intramural programs, University camps
and clinics, and leisure-learn programs.

So if the lacrosse team has a game scheduled
against Penn State, and a few no-name Pirate
outfielders want to run a clinic teaching Little
Leaguers how to swing a baseball bat in the
Cost Center, then the lacrosse team has to ﬁnd a
nice patch of grass on the Cathedral lawn and
hope the German club hasn't already started a
pickup game of soccer there.

If it's lucky, the team might find a spot to
play on CMU's field, in the middle of a cold
February, even though the University decreed
recently that all student groups have to operate
from Pitt's campus. Isn't that ironic?

If it can't find somewhere to play, Pitt's
lacrosse team has to forfeit, and Penn State has
another reason to think Pitt is a worthless
school.

So much for students first.

This would be a perfect opportunity for the
Student Government Board to take up a worthy
cause that won't cost any money: convince the
powers that be to let students groups like the
lacrosse team get access to the resources and
facilities they need.

Because if they can't access Pitt's resources,

well, then what are organized student groups
for?

Columnlst

There will be no end to the cri-
sis in Iraq until Saddam Hussein is
dead. This probably isn't what a lot
of people want to hear, but it is
clearly the only feasible, long-term
solution to the problem.

Recently, after meeting with
U.N. Secretary—General Kofi
Annan, Hussein agreed to lift his
ban on arms inspections on presi-
dential properties. Supposedly,
inspectors may now enter eight
never-before-inspected palaces, as
well as other areas they were
denied access to in the past.
According to the agreement, the
inspectors will have unlimited
access to the sites, and unlimited
time to inspect them.

This may sound good, but keep
in mind who we are dealing with.
Saddam Hussein is no typical
leader. He doesn't truly look out for
what is best for his country. He
doesn't make much of an effort to
get along with the rest of the world.
And, most unforttmately, he is very
crazy but at the same time very
smart, which makes for a danger-
ous combination.

Hussein has no intention of
really backing down. There is no
way he will let the United Nations
destroy all his nuclear weapons or
stop building new ones. If he did
plan on completely backing down
forever, he would have made a bet-
ter agreement with the United
Nations, and he wouldn't have
waited to comply until the United
States was ready to drop bombs.

There are serious doubts as to
whether Hussein will follow
through on this agreement. U.S.
intelligence assessments are highly

The Pitt News

‘Agreement’ doesn't mean it's over

skeptical that Hussein will do what
he said, and with good reason.
Saddam Hussein is a cold, calculat-
ing man.

Instead of speaking of toler-
ance to his people, he ﬁlls their
minds with lies, turning them
against the United States, to satisfy
his own personal interests. For
example, during the Gulf War,
every time the United States would
bomb a weapons site, he would tell
his people that we had bombed a
school full of children. It is no dif-
ferent now. It is no longer safe for
U.S. citizens to be in Iraq because
of all the propaganda with which
he has ﬁlled his people's minds.

Obviously, the only reason he
agreed to the U.N. demands is that
he wants to delay an attack by the
United States as long as possible.
The key word is delay. He will
never back down 100 percent. He
just wants to manipulate the United
States, just like he manipulates the
people of Iraq, for as long as possi-
ble, putting off as long as possible

, the start ofa war he has no way of

winning.

The inspectors should realize
there is no way they will be able to
ﬁnd and destroy every nuclear
weapon, every canister of nerve
gas or anthrax, etc. Hussein has
countless underground bunkers

. where he is hiding only God knows

what.

Hussein might be crazy, but he

is by no means stupid. He isn't
going to tell us where everything
is, and I'm sure he has the means to
hide weapons, regardless of what

he might say or what naive people
, may imagine.

President Clinton said on
Monday, "If Iraq fails to comply

this time, providing immediate,
unrestricted, unconditional access
to all sites, there will be serious
consequences." Clinton means the
written agreement is only part of
the deal; Hussein still has to com-
ply with actions, not just words.

Clinton is talking tough, and
he seems like he will follow
through on his threat, as he is keep-
ing the troops stationed over in the
Gulf.

Hussein might seem acquies-
cent for a couple weeks, even
months, but eventually he will
cause trouble again. That is a guar-
antee.

The only way to completely
remove the risk of him stirring up
trouble again is not to have him
sign agreements he has no inten-
tion of keeping; it is to have him
killed.

It wouldn't be an easy task.
Since it is known that he sleeps in
a different place every night, he
would be difﬁcult to find. It can be
done, though, if enough effort is
put forth. With all the high-tech
weapons around, we could send a
missile in or perhaps drop a bomb.
We could even send in a team of
snipers. Regardless of the means
used, he must die. It is that simple.

The biggest mistake of the
Gulf War was not killing him when
we had the chance. He was quiet
for a couple years, but now he is
back again, causing problems. If he
didn't completely stop causing
trouble after we defeated him
seven years ago, there is no reason
for anyone think he will relent now.

Carrie Hager would shoot Hussein
herself, given a long-range
Tomahawk cruise missile.

Who does Pitt pay to generate these stupid ideas?

Kevin
Carey

It was closing in on that time -— I’m
sure you're familiar with it ——- the last 10
minutes before class begins, when
you're not sure if you should swing the
door open and head to class or just pro-
crastinate for another ﬁve minutes.

Well, I decided to procrastinate, and
what better way to pass the time than to
continue my long—term suicide program
— caffeine and nicotine. As I sat outside
the Cathedral of Learning, I noticed
these glossy black garbage cans that
were wearing name tags. I took a few
steps, approaching the situation with
confused caution, and I read the white
square. It bore the title of “cigarette
um."

So I thought to myself, what is a
cigarette urn? (Try it as an exercise.)

What the hell is a cigarette um? It
would not leave my head. I ﬁgured that
I would have to further evaluate the
entire notion of a cigarette um.

I looked into the sterling silver cir-

I cle and saw a collection of butts. The

us. ... .._..t.' ._ '.~. "’.‘.i:!.‘.',}. ‘-'~.'f"'.. .'

rzun-l-A11. .-I.

  

representatives in the circle included
members of the Camel, Marlboro and
Winston families, to name a few. There
were more butts in this yuppie-tagged
ash tray then there are on the set of
"Baywatch."

As I thought of "Baywatch," I
immediately envisioned a half-clothed

woman jumping into the ocean to wash
off the sand. Then it hit me: Sand hap-
pens to form the largest ash tray inlthe
world. The beach, or sand, is made up of
millions of quartz ﬁbers. And I am sure
that if you ask your favorite chemistry
friend (if you have one) what quartz is,
he will tell you, "silicon dioxide."
Silicon triggered an immediate connec-
tion back to "Baywatch" because the
bikinis on that set, like the beach itself,
hold large deposits of silicon...

So where does this leave me in
answering what a cigarette urn is? Your
guess is as good as mine.

In my second step of investigating.
the cigarette um, I wanted to be positive
that I knew what an urn was. I ﬂipped
through the dictionary, found "um," and
read through the deﬁnitions. The first
deﬁnition is always the obvious one,
and in this case that trend remained true.
"Um" was deﬁned as a vase for holding
ﬂowers. . -

As I further scaled down the deﬁni-

tions, I found a deﬁnition that was,

potentially applicable to this column.
Deﬁnition No. 3, which never received
any credit prior to this article, deﬁned an
"urn" as a vase for holding the ashes of
the dead.

So basically, the University is
spending money on these cute, artsy lit-
tle ashtrays that are holding the
deceased tobacco ﬁelds of Virginia! And
since I have managed to avoid giving an

opinion thus far, here it is.

Who thinks of these meaningless
labels? Who actually takes time to
invent such worthless ideas? I’m not
quite sure, but I can deﬁnitely say that as
a smoker I feel much safer about things
on campus now that we have cigarette
urns. I am not suggesting that these
damn urns cost lots of
money or anything. I
am, however, saying
that the University,
and people at large,
invest entirely too
much time on ridicu-
lous projects, cigarette
urns being just one
example.

I understand that
the cigarette butts on
the ground are an
ungodly sight. I also
feel that each person
responsible for leaving
one of these remnants
should have to go and pick it up with his
teeth, after he has already been lashed to
a purplish black and blue. However,
does putting the title "cigarette um" on
an ashtray actually inﬂuence anyone to
use it more than he would already?

Drumroll... no! .

In all honesty, it does nothing more
than amuse me. ~ .

Despite my opinion that the ciga-
rette urn is waste of time, money and

He said

thought, I personally feel that whoever

opted to create the cigarette urn deserves
a substantial raise. I know that the
University is having a difﬁcult time get-
ting money together to invest in such
projects as the building of a new donni-
tory or the hiring of a new men’s bas-
ketball coach, but this cigarette urn
inventor deserves
something special.
Here is the best
solution: We need to
tap our old buddy Tom

one more time and ask
for a few more bucks.
If Gov. Ridge had the

barrage of “Does any-
body have some
change,” commonly
known as a day in

a few quarters in that
pocket of his, then I’m
sure he would be more than happy to
help. _ »

Who knows? Maybe there would
even be enough change for both the cig-

arette um inventor and the “maintainal '

care facilitators,” a.k.a. the maintenance
workers.

Kevin Carey thinks Pitt's next project

should be labeling plastic knives,_ forks

Many great’ men, ranging

baseball in the city of Pittsburgh,
but many of the greatest have
been lost in time, just like their

These athletes played in the
Negro Leagues, for the
Pittsburgh Crawfords and the

- Homestead Grays.

One of these men, the Rev.
C. Harold Tinker, starred for the
Crawfords from 1927 to 1931.
Many may ask why he played
baseball without ever having a
chance to be remembered by the
game or the city.

“I just loved baseball. Ihad

an unwritten segregation rule
enacted by owners) until Jackie
Robinson reintegrated baseball
in 1947, many of the exploits of
black ballplayers, especially
those in the Negro Leagues, have
become baseball’s best-kept
secrets.

The Negro Leagues pro-
duced some of the most intrigu-
ing, although sometimes unbe-
lievable, baseball stories ever
told.

One such story treats Gibson
— a former Crawford and Gray
— as a folk hero. It goes some-
thing like this: Gibson read the
paper each morning to see how
many home runs Babe Ruth had
hit the day before. Gibson
always believed that he had
something to live up to because
the people of Pittsburgh called
him the “King of Swat.” _

Gibson believed that if Ruth
had hit two home runs the day

  
  

Gibson, called the Black
Babe Ruth by many fans
because of exploits such as
these, first moved to Pittsburgh
from Georgia with his father,
who went to work in the steel
mills.

. Gibson was playing for a
junior all-star team when Tinker,
playing for the professional all-
star team, discovered him and
brought him to the Crawfords.

“This boy really impressed
me, the way he handled himself,
and he was only 15,” Tinker said.
“Josh played a tremendous game
that day, so I took him to Gus
[Greenlee, the owner of the
Crawfords]. From then on he
was the Crawfords’ catcher. This
is the single greatest thing that I
did for baseball.”

Gibson went on to win bat-
ting titles for the Crawfords in
1932, 1934 and 1936, in addition

Rev. Tinker, now 92, relaxes at his home in the Hill District.

Crawfords equaled the talent and
skill of teams such as the 1927
New York Yankees, who are
arguably the best team in the his-
tory of baseball. For example,
some call Charleston — who
played for the Crawfords — the
black Ty Cobb. ‘

Others call Cobb the white
Charleston. '

The Crawfords came from-

the modest beginnings of a recre-
ational ﬁeld near the Crawfords
Bathhouse in the Hill District.
The team kept improving and
became a part of the Negro
Leagues just a few years later.

The Crawfords and their tal-
ented athletes were not the only
game in town. The crosstown
Homestead Grays‘ evolved from
the Homestead Steel Works team
funded by Andrew Carnegie and
won nine consecutive Negro
National League pennants from
1937 to 1945.

The air was tense, and the adrenaline
was running high.
NFL scouts were fumbling with their

clipboards and making small talk with
-Panther football coaches and fellow

scouts. At 3 p.m. on Tuesday, Pitt’s grad-
uating seniors made their way onto the
Cost Center’s turf for the NFL scouting
workouts.

“I hope it goes well for all the play-
ers. This is a good chance to show otf
their physical ability,” Panther Head
Coach Walt Harris said.

. The players were demonstrating
their physical attributes and talent in front
of scouts from Green Bay, San Francisco,
Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Buffalo and

In addition to the scouts, Tom
Donahoe, the Steelers’ highly respected
director of player personnel, was on hand
to watch the workouts. S

“Mainly we are looking at the play-
ers’ attitudes and their physical ability.
You can tell who wants to be here bad
enough and who doesn’t,” Donahoe said

‘There are a couple of kids that deﬁ-
nitely have a chance to get drafted.”

Donahoe was very impressed with
Pitt quarterback Pete Gonzalez’s year and
wasn’t very concerned by one of the fac-

tors rumored to have soured other NFL

prospectors —— the quarterback’s height.
Gonzalez is listed at 6-foot-1 in the
Panther media guide. .

“You really have to take a look at

other aspects. His
height is only one
factor. He broke
records and had a

ly has great leader-

Panthers roll into conference tourney

Eric Mosley

Hawkins, shownvs. Providence, looks to add more dunks in N.Y.C.

Staff Writer

Pitt forward Ricardo Greer
asked Head Coach Ralph Wllard
what might have been if the
Panthers had a healthy team earli-
er in the season and got off to a
better start.

W1llard’s reply, “That’s what
happened last season.”

Last season, the Panthers
turned a bad start around and won
the last three games of the regular
season and a big game in the Big
East Tournament, vaulting them
to an NIT bid.

- And‘ just like last year, the
Panthers — winners of their last
three games ‘— are hoping next
week’s conference tournament in
New York City at the “World’s
Most Famous Arena” (Madison
Square Garden) will have the
same results.

But despite facing the same
adversity and hitting a similar
stride at the end of the season,
Willard is quick to say that this
year’s squad cannot be compared
to last year’s club. '

“This is an entirely different

group of kids,” \V1llard said.
“Vonteego [Cummings] is the
only starter to have any type of
game experience coming into this
season. These kids are forming
their own identity. They have
fought through the injuries and
gone through a lot together.
They’re just trying to get better.”

And better they have gotten.
The winning streak has given the
Panthers (11-13) some conﬁdence
heading into their ﬁnal two weeks
of play. The streak has also raised
.their seeding in the Big East
Tournament. Less than two weeks
ago, the Panthers were the ' 13th
and last seed in the tournament.
Now they are the eighth seed and
could even jump higher with wins
at Syracuse Thursday and Seton
Hall Sunday.

“We’re on a roll right now,”
freshman Attila Cosby said. “We
just want to keep it going.”

Though unlikely, ‘a strong ﬁn-
ish could give the Panthers hope
for another bid to the NIT. They
could’ even land an automatic bid
to the NCAA Tournament if they
win the Big East Tournament.

This is how the other Big East

teams match up as the conference
heads to New York next week.
Georgetown (14-11) Following
their loss to Pitt last Tuesday, the
Hoyas rebounded to blow out

  EWL event first inividual
effort for Panther grapplers

Brian Knavish

Staff Wrlter

Wrestling has a two-part season, but
unlike most other sports, the entire sport
takes on a new face for the postseason.
November through February makes

1‘ up the dual-meet season where the men-
tality and preparation is team-based. Pitt
la takes on other schools for the purpose of
coming away from the match as the better

team.
When March rolls around, the scope

. of wrestling takes on an individual men-
j tality. Wrestlers represent their schools in
. conference tournaments, but only out-

standing individuals, not entire teams,
advance to the NCAA championships.

For Pitt, next up is the Eastern
Wrestling League Tournament. VV1th ﬁve
of its seven teams ranked in the top 25, the

" EWL is one of the nation’s toughest con-
» ferences.

The top three wrestlers in each weight
class and six other grapplers (selected by
the coaches) advance from the EWL

A’ Tournament to the NCAA championships.

Last year, Pitt sent a school-record six
wrestlers to the NCAAs, and this season,
the Panthers have an excellent shot at

. sending eight or more to the big dance.

Here’s a look at the Panther lineup

= going into the EWL event:

118 — Pitt freshman Shawn Arnistade

-gets the nod at the 1'18-pound weight
I class. After winning the starting spot mid-
way through the year, Amistade / put
‘together a solid ﬁrst season, but his inex-
perience could hurt him at the tournament.
.-His toughest competition will come from

Clarion’s Lee Pritts, who is ranked 10th in

3 the country.

‘I 126 — Last year, Rob Loper came one

 short of becoming the ﬁrst Panther
ﬁeshmanto win anEWLtitle. This year,
Lock Haven’s Terry Showalter is ranked
fourth in the country and is the favorite to

- the title. But on his way to compiling

‘a 25-4 record this year, Loper beat
Showalter once and leads their all-time
‘series 3-1. Chances are, ifLoper can beat

home ﬁrst place.

THE PITT NEWS

 

142 — This will be the second EWL tour-
nament for Panther starting 142—pounder
Mike Ziska. He wrestled his way to a 15-
11 record this season but will have some
pretty stiif competition in ninﬂ1—ranked
Tom Tomeo of Clarion.

150 — Last season, Pitt’s Kevin Jolmson

qualiﬁed for the NCAAs at 150. Redshirt

junior Brian Pardini beat out Johnson for
the starting spot midway through this year,
so logic suggests that Pardini has a good
shot at advancing to the big tournament
this season. West Vrrginia’s Mike Mason,
ranked fourth in the nation, is the favorite
to win this weight class.

158 — Redshirt junior Jake Schaus has
put together a 14-12 record this season and
should qualify for the nationals for the
third straight year. Mountaineer Sam
Kline is the favorite to win the class.

167 — If rankings are any indication,
Nick Mengerink will become the ﬁrst-
ever Pitt ﬁeshman to win- an EWL title.
Mengerink is ranked seventh in the nation,

fortune of wrestling in arguably the tough-

est weight class in the conference. He’s.

ranked fourth in the country, and
Edinboro’s Jim Straight and Lock
Haven’s Dave Murray are also nationally
ranked A

190 — Pitt’s other two-timeAllAmerican,
Mark Bodo, has been a runner-up for the
conference title twice. Despite being
rankedﬁfthinthecountryanclbeing
arguably the best wrestler on the team, he

may have to settle for second again i

because Edinboro’s Jason Robison is the
country’s top-ranked 190-pounder.
Robison beat Bodo via pinfall in a dual
meet last weekend

Heavyweight —— Matt Mueller might be
the most athletic heavyweight in the
EWL. He. has unlimited potential, but his
inexperience cost him in a couple of
matches this season. Mueller may get the
chance for some revenge against his
nemesis —WVU’s Vince Pellis, who beat
Mueller in the waning seconds of their
match earlier this year. ‘

As many Pitt students take the armual
spring break pilgrimage to the surmy beach-
es of Florida next week, the Pitt Panther

baseball squad will be gearing up for anoth-

er exciting season on the diamond.

The baseball team is in a state very sim-
ilar to that of the football team in late August
of last year. It has a new coach, Joe Jordano,
and a new “attitu .”

Jordano was named head coach of the
team this past November after Mark
Jackson ——- currently a head coach at Point
Park College — left the squad. J ordano
comes to Pitt after coaching at Mercyhurst
College in Erie, where he led the men’s team
to a record of285-111-1 in the past 10 years
—— an all-time high for a Mercyhurst coach.

THE PITT NEWS

 

Ned Schano
Senlor Staff Writer

After learning that he had
been chosen this week’s Big
East Rookie of the Week, Pitt
forward Ricardo Greer raced
home to call his brother.

“It’s three to two, now,”
Greer said, cracking his
trademark smile.

Ricardo was talking to his
brother Jeff, the other award-
winning freshman basketball
star in the Greer family. Jeff
Greer, the 6-foot—4 forward
for Rutgers, has shown poten-
tial similar to that of his 6-
foot-5 brother. _

Both have had tremen-
dous first years in the Big
East. But the big difference
between the two, as Ricardo
is quick to point out, is that
Jeff has only two Rookie of
the Week awards compared to
Ricardo’s three.

It’s all just a healthy fam-
ily rivalry for “Washington
Heights’ Finest,” the Greer
brothers’ shared nickname.

Although there has been
debate whether to call the Pitt
forward “Ricardo,” “Rico,”
or “Ricky,” the older Greer
brother said the “Washington
Heights’ Finest” moniker is
his favorite.

The

ers’ nickname was never
more apparent than during the
Pitt-Rutgers game on Jan. 17.
A group of approximately 50
of the Greers’ friends and rel-
atives made the seven hour
trip from New York to
Pittsburgh to watch the broth-
ers duel.

Holding a sign that read
“Washington Heights’ Finest:
Ricky #25 and Jeff #25,” the
Greer fans created a stir
whenever Ricky or Jeff made
a basket.

Ricardo got the best of his
younger brother in that game,
outscoring Jeff 22 to 9. But,
Jeff got his revenge one week
later at Rutgers by outscoring
Ricardo 19 to 8.

Although Ricardo is quite
proud of his nickname (his
right bicep boasts a four-inch
tattoo of it), he may soon be
gaining another nickname:
“Pitt basketbal1’s finest.”

Greer has been a spark-
plug for the Panthers during
his freshman season. He’s
second on the team in
rebounding (6.7 rpg), second
in assists (3.8 apg) and third
in scoring (12.5 ppg).

history, with seven freshmen,
three sophomores, one junior
and only one senior on the
roster.

The lack of experience on
the team has brought its fair
share of errors._ But, it has
also opened the door for the
freshmen to step in and make
immediate contributions.

Ricardo has made the
biggest impact of the fresh-
men, starting every game and
logging an amazing 34.9 min-
utes per game. Greer has also
been invaluable as a backup
point guard 2 to Vonteego
Cummings this season — a
position he has never played.

“[Playing the point] is
helping the team because it
gives Vonteego and Jarrett
[Lockhart] more open looks,”
Greer said.

Whether he is running the
point or scrapping for
rebounds, he said he hardly
feels like a freshman.

“All those freshman jit-
ters they talk about are gone
by now because I’ve been
playing so much this year,”
Greer said.

He thinks the valuable

minutes that he and fellow
freshmen Attila Cosby,
Stephen Flores and ‘Kevin
Leslie have received bode
well for the team in the
future. -
“All these minutes are
helping me a lot,” he said.
‘.fI’ll already be a step ahead
next year.”

But neither Greer nor

Head Coach Ralph Willard’

have been surprised by his
success. Willard told Greer
before the season started that

. he had the opportunity to step

in and start in his first season.
Willard called the freshmen’s
combined experience “bap—
tism by ﬁre.” -

“These kids are gaining
their own identity,” Willard
said. “They have fought
through injuries and gone
through a lot together. They
think they can become a good
team next year andeven late
this year.”

Greer entered Pitt with
impressive credentials. He
had an outstanding senior
year at Cheshire (Conn.)

award, may not both come
true, but this hasn’t dimin-
ished his. outstanding first
year.

But not everything“ has
been rosy this season. The
most discouraging sign has
been the injuries that have
plagued the Panthers.
Sophomore _ guard Kellii
Taylor played in only 10
games and is out for the sea-
son with ankle problems.
Freshman, guard John
Finneman has missed the
entire season with soreness in
his knee, and freshman for-

ward Michael Shin has

missed seven games with a
calf strain.

No team can expect to go
through a season without a
few injuries, but Greer does-
n’t like to use that as an

excuse for Pitt’s rocky sea-

son. ,

“It doesn’t_ matter who’s
hurt because every team has
injuries,” he said. “We can’t
hold that as an excuse.”

Willard said the injuries
have affected the team. .

“It is tough with so few
healthy bodies,” Willard said.
“But it’s good to see them
have some success [late in the
season].”

That success has translat-
ed .into three straight confer-
ence wins as the Panthers
make a push into the Big East
Tournament next week.

And as Ricardo Greer will
tell you, nothing would be a
better ending to his freshman
year than playing Rutgers and
beating his brother one more

PARDINI

“He’s what I call a tried and true
Pittsburgher,” Head Coach Rande
Stottlemyer said. “He has that blue-
collar work ethic, you might hearia
football coach call a guy like that a
‘mucker.’ He does what he needs to
do, keeps his nose out of trouble, and
is a good student.”

Pardini walked on to the Pitt
wrestling team four years agoafter
compiling a 37-5 record during his
senior year at nearby Upper St. Clair
High School.

He’s currently a redshirt junior
after gaining an extra year of eligibili-
ty by redshirting as a freshman. And
now, his fourth year on the team, all
the hard work has paid off.

“He’s a great story. He comes
here, works his butt off, sits on the
bench for four years, and fights his
way into the starting lineup,”
Assistant Coach Dan Payne said.

Earning that starting spot at the
150-pound weight class is a huge
accomplishment for a guy like
Pardini.

 

FROM PAGE 9

 

“It means a lot to me. For the past
three and a half years l’ve been com-
ing to practice, day in and day out, and
it gets discouraging not getting a
chance to wrestle,” Pardini said.

“To tell you the truth, I thought
about quitting a couple of times, but I
couldn’t imagine not wrestling. I love
the sport,” he continued. “I’ve been
doing this for 13 years, I just don’t
know what else I’d do with my time.”

Teams hold “wrestle-offs” to
make sure the best wrestler at each
weight class is in the starting lineup.
In a wrest1e—off, all of the grapplers at
a particular. weight class wrestle each
other, and the winner is declared the
team’s starter.

Last year was the first year Pardini
had a legitimate shot at winning ‘a
spot. Kevin Johnson was penciled in
as the starter, but because he trans-
ferred to Pitt, he was ineligible for the
first semester.

But Pardini could not beat out
Larry Sprecher for the starting spot.

At the beginning of this year,
Pardini inched even closer to earning
a starting slot. In the first week of
January, Pardini finally started, reap-

who qualified for the NCAA tourna-
ment last year, and was declared the
starter at 150.

Now that he has fought his way
into the lineup, he said there’s talk
about him receiving a scholarship for
next season.

“That’s something I’m very hope-
ful of,” Pardini explains. “I just had a
discussion with my dad about when
I’d be graduating, and I told him I
wanted to stay a fifth year.”

“He said ‘That’s fine, but who’s
going to, pay for it?’ [Pardini’s father
pays for his school now] I told him
that hopefully, if things worked out
how I hoped, the University would be
paying for it.”

As far as the future goes, Pardini

imay decide to stay involved with’

wrestling as a coach.
“I think that would be a fun way to
stay involved,” the administration of

career goal is to get into the Secret

The Negro Leagues continued to
have a significant impact on black
advancement in baseball until 1947,
when Robinson signed a contract with
Branch Rickey and the Brooklyn
Dodgers to play major league baseball.

The Negro Leagues tried to continue
but lasted only a few years. This helped
the black players who made it to the
majors, but hurt the black community. .

Blacks lost control of their players
and their game. Black fans, owners and
management became bystanders to the
game instead of integral parts as they
were before integration.

This ‘problem continues to this day in
major league baseball’. There is only one
black general manager, and there are no
black owners in baseball, 41 years after
baseba1l’s integration.

Baseball began to make strides -

toward recognizing these players and

In a statement following his leav-
ing the Grizzlies, West said, ‘The trade
just blew everything up, but maybe
this was’ the best thing that ever hap-
pened to me. This was my wake-up
call.”

West has checked into a rehabili-
tation program that will keep him out .
of basketball for four or more weeks,
but West isn’t sure if he will play again
this season, stressing that he needs to
get his life in order.

“I don’t need that. I need her
[Wuela] tobeapart of my life. Iwillbe
‘Doug West, human being’ longer than
I will be ‘Doug West, basketball play-
er.’”

Get well, Doug.

SCOUTS

Gonzalez set a personal best in the 40-
yard dash with a mark of 4.64 seconds — a
very quick time for a quarterback, according
to the scouts. He also looked impressive

‘throwing the football in the Cost Center.

“It was exciting and a lot of fun,”
Gonzalez said. “It was nicepto work out for
guys who know football. Hopefully, I can
make someone happy. Some of the scouts said
I had a» good workout. Hopefully, I’ll get invit-

Thursday, 26 February 1998

ed to other workouts and camps.”

Hoffart, Pitt’s big-play receiver last sea-
son, also made a splash at the tryout.

“I‘ set [personal] marks in everything
except the 40-yard dash. I think I had areal
good workout,” Hoffatt said.

Hoffart’s coach at Sacramento State,
where he played as a freshman, is now the
quarterbacks coach of the San Francisco
49ers. (

“It helps to have connections in the pros.
They aren’t going to give out any handouts,
but it sure helps,” Hoffatt said.

ages 23.3 points per game. The problem is,
nobody can. VV1th a strong performance from
his teammates, the Irish could surprise some
teams in New York.

Rutgers (12-13 1 Another team that could catch
a club olf-guard. Geoff Billet and Jeff Greer
(Ricardo’s brother) could" pull off an upset or
two.

Seton Hall (14-13) The Pirates have been a bit
of a surprise this season, and they could shock
some people in the tournament. If they can ﬁn-
ish the tournament boasting a .500 record, they
become eligible for the NIT.

Sﬂncuse (20-f2 ) Senior Todd Burgan has expe-

rience in tournament play. Add Etan Thomas to
the mix, and the nationally ranked Orangemen
have a chance at winning the tournament.

Boston College (13-15) Last season’s touma-

ment champion will ﬁght hard to defend its

crown, but B.C. has won only one of its last six
games.

Connecticut (25-4) The Huskies —— currently ‘

tops in the Big East Six division —— are loaded
with talent. With a_ win over St. John’s on
Saturday, they can clinch the top seed in the
tournament. 2
ﬁ  Senior Felipe Lopez is ﬁnal-
ly living up to his freshman hype, leading the
Red Storm to victories in 12 of their last 13
games. VV1th the hometown crowd behind it,
the Red Storm has a legitimate shot at winning
the tournament.

Villanova (10-IQ) The Wildcats rely on the
three-point shooting of John Celestand and
Howard Brown. When they’re hot from behind
the arc, they win. When they’re not, they usu-
ally lose. _ ‘ .
West Virginia (22-5) The Mountaineers could

make a run at a Big East championship if star‘

forward~Damian Owens recovers from a back
injury he suffered two weeks ago.
