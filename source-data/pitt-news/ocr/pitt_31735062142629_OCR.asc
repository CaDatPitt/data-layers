New Director

Leads Pitt’s
Glee Clubs

Under the supervision ‘of Pro-
fessor David Weiss, both Men’s
and Women’s Glee clubs plan to
resume normal functions during
the coming year. A spring concert
tour for Men’s Glee club already
is on the agenda, although the
itinerary has not been completed.

Men’s Glee club has about 25
holdovers from last year’s organ-
ization and proposes to add an-
other 35 men to bring its strength
to 60. _

Women’s Glee club is in ,the
same position, needing nearly 35
new voices to bring it to the de-
sired strength. Freshman women‘
cannot participate in glee club ac-
tivities but all men students are
eligible for glee club.

Professor Weiss, a recent ad-
dition to the faculty, has been
discharged from the army where
his duties kept him in Germany
as an interpreter. A native of
Bethlehem, Pa., he graduated from
Penn State and received his mas-
ter’s degree from Columbia uni-
versity.

Rehearsal schedules for Wom-
en’s Glee club call for practice
sessions at 3:30 Monday afternoon
and 6:00 Wednesday evening.
Men’s Glee club will rehearse at
4:30 Monday afternoon and 7:45
Wednesday evening. Rehearsals
will be in Room- 3117 C1.

Tryouts will be given this aft-
ernoon in Room 3117 C1. from
1:30 to 5:30 for both Men’s and
Women’s Gleedclubs.

Last year Men’s Glee club did
not make any concert trip but
conﬁned its activities to a concert
in conjunction with the glee club
from Pennsylvania College for
Women at PCW in May. 9

Cap and Gown
To Stage Show

In December

Cap and Gown, Pitt’s all-male
musical revue, hits the revived
list of Pitt activities this year.
The tentative date for Cap and
Gown’s thirty-ﬁfth production is
December‘ 3 to 14. The eleven

"performances will be at Stephen

Foster Memorial.

Theodore W. Biddle, Dean of
Men, has been graduate manager
sincethe middle 1930's.

Rehearsals beginearly in No-
vember, according to William F.
Saalbach, assistant to the Dean of
Men.

“Cap 1‘ and Gown needs come-
dians, dancers, singers, techni-
cians, musicians, and stage-hands,”
explained Mr. Saalbach. “As far
as possible, we’d like to have the
entire production handled by Pitt
Men.”

The show is sponsored by Cap
and Gown, Inc., a non.proﬁt or-
ganization of alumni who have
taken an active part in former
productions. Outstanding senior
contributors were tapped into the
club. This group elects the director
or graduate manager, sets the po-
licies and assumes responsibili-
ties for the show.

Before the war, Cap and Gown
went on the road to Western Penn-
sylvania towns and Jamestown,
N. Y. The last two productions
were “Snap Your Fingers,” in
1940, and “Head Over Heels,” in
1941.

Cap and Gowners handle the
female parts without outside as-
sistance. The story, music, lyrics,
and dances are original.

“Hail to Pitt-,1’ University ﬁght
song, was introduced in the 1910
Cap and Gown production, “Her
and There.” , 1

Strike Causes Delay;

Registration In Progress

Delayed by the power strike blackout, late registration was held;
inithe Commons room, Wednesday, Thursday, and today. Most of the 0

students were adjusting schedules and changing courses.

The Registrar’s’ Office had been open throughout the strike-bound‘:

holiday to catch up with the plethora of bookwork. However, ﬁn-
al announcement of registration totals will not be available until th

Greek Temple,

Band Feature

Pitt football fans have some
thrilling Saturday afternoons in
store for them at the Stadium.
The University. of Pittsburgh
marching band, now 120 strong
and already a great eye—pleaser
by virtue of its first two per-
formances, has exciting plans for
the rest of the gridiron session.

To1norrow’s fans will be treated
to some new formations by the
band. In honor of Temple Univer-
sity an entirely new design, a
Greek temple, will be presented.
The band- also will spell out
OWLS for the visitors and play
the Temple ﬁght song. The Pitt
Alma Mater and “Hail To Pitt”
are to be played while the band
marches into the PITT formation.

The band boys have been work'-
ing hard to perfect new and diffi-
cult formations to present to the
Stadium spectators. M e m b e r s
have been coming out for practice-
at the Stadium many times during
thepast two and a half weeks of
the power strike, despite trans-
portation -, difficulties. The band
holds, regular music rehearsals
every Thursday night plus two
other drills during the week re-
gardless of weather conditions.

The band’s performance tomor-
row" is an indication of things
to come. According to Robert L.
Arthur, University band director,
Pitt rooters are in for some special
treats as the-season. rolls on. Plans

are being completed for special

formations for the Marquette and
Purdue games. Mr. Arthur also

said that the band will travel to

Columbus for the Ohio State
game. The O. S. U. and Pitt bands
will combine to present a unique
exhibition of formations before
game time. During half ‘time both
universities will be honored.

For the beneﬁt of Pitt students,
Mr. Arthur explained that the
marching song used by the band
on the field during formations is
“On To Victory,” a piece written
especially for the University by
Lester M. Taylor.

University, has been named presi-
dent of the Ziff—DaVis Publishing
company, Chicago, to succeed W.
B. Ziff, who becomes chairman of
the board and publisher.

Davis was editor of the “Pitt
Panther” and secretary-treasurer
of the Association of College Com-
ics of the East“before joining the
W. B. Ziff company as assistant
to the president in 1927. He has
been vice-president and general
manager of the Ziff-Davis Pub-
lishing company since 1936.

Demonstration Block Out
For Pitt-Temple Contest -

Pitt’s gold and blue demonstra-

tion block is another of the many"

victims of the Pittsburgh power
strike.'Ted Mallinger, in charge
of the block, announces that once
again plans for its return to the
campus must be postponed until
the power strike is settled.

Because of the shortage of elec-
tric power, laundries will not ac-
cept for cleaning the Pitt gold and
blue capes which have been in
storage for three years. They can-
not be used i‘ their present con-
dition. "

Until the strike is settled or
some arrangement is made for
cleaning the capes, the fate of the
demonstration block will hangin

the balance. Originally scheduled

-to appear at the West Virginia

game, the block’s return has been
cancelled twice.

Nevertheless, Chairman Ted
Mallinger and his committee are
laying groundwork for a demon-
stration section to take part at
games whenever a'let—up in the
strike occurs. . ‘I

Letters are being mailed to fra-
ternities, social groups and other
organizations that are expected to
participate. A meeting of rep-
resentatives from these
will be arranged as soon as all of
them have contacted the commit-
tee. a 1 I '

groups _

w‘>ﬁgures are cleared through the

Chancellor’s oﬁice. -
Registrar J. G. Quick has asked

forclariﬁcation of the statements:
made by the Pittsburghpapers 
and the Pitt News concerning the'_U
°_f:’:‘
18,000 students. “Our ﬁgures for
this semester will not approach”
the much publicized ﬁgure of‘
18,000. That total was given ’_in “

expected registration totals

reference to the complete year of
1946-47 ~— from July 1 to Jun
30,” says Mr. Quick. "
In an earlier announcemen.t,lthe
Dean of Men’s "ofﬁce expected
more than 8,000 veterans to regis-
ter for courses at the University

this fall. This ﬁgure did not in- .

clude the Pittextension centers,
such as Erieiand Johnstown. The
inﬂux of veterans increased the
serious student housing problem.
It also forced. the University to
use the old Shadyside Academy
building at Morewood and E115-
worth Avenues for classes in the;
schools of'“Engineering and Mines
and Business Administration. ,

According to the Dean of Wom-
en’s Office, the total number of
Freshman women is 330. All have
been assigned to mentor groups of
six or seven and to Orientation
classes.’ ‘ ' 

' “These women have been se- ;

lected in competition with many
others on the basis of grades and
college work,” explained iss
Helen Poole -Rush, Dean of 'Wom-'
en. ~

Inaugurated  

The University car pool, es-
tablished Wednesday, will func-

portation tie-up to aid students
in getting to and from school;

All car owners and students de-,
siring transportation are urged to

register at the desk located at the
Fifth and Bigelow Blvd., corner of
the Commons room.

The system thus far h_as had
considerable success and was re-
sponsible to a great extent for the
unexpectedly large attendance i

tions the “first day classes resum-

Those who have obtained rides
are urged to keep them on a semi-

spite of the fact that the new sys-
tem has been quite successful,
there are more riders than cars
available, but this situation is
expected to be remedied as the

Several persons have phoned for
rides and some have been fortu
nate in procuring them, but for
the majority it has been impossi-“-

A months ago that his Honor, the mayor, and Mr. George Mueller

the right of this minority group to interrupt our normal liv-
ing and daily routine is worthy of our consideration.

To refrain from mentioning personalities and to bring the
whole situation into an academic discussion, everything seems
to focus on this point: Do public utility workers have the right
-to strike under any circumstances? a -

Our American system of government places sovereignty
in the will of the majority of the people. These people, through
their government, grant to utilities the exclusive right to per-
form utility service in a speciﬁed area, expecting in return,
faithful and continuous service. From this, it seems evident
that utilities and the persons who work for utilihy companies
owe their all-egience primarily to the people, expressed as the
:will of the majority. Hence, utilities workers are public servants.
When a young man prepares to enterthe medical profession,
‘he does so fully aware that when he becomes a doctor his time
will not be his own; he is becoming a servant of the public.
A utilities worker is as fully a public servant as is a medical
doctor and should be conscious of this fact when he accepts
such _a_ position. This fact should be one of the vocational tech-
nicalities concomitant with utility service, just as it is with

As Veterans, Sister Enroll

It’s Father who pays! ’

Freshmen, next time dad balks
at your borrowing the car or com-
plains bitterly about the money it
takes to keep you in pins, just
refer him to Mr. Albert P. Hill of
Fox Chapel Manor, Aspinwall.
For Mr. Hill is the father of —- not
one, not two, but three Pitt fresh-
ies.

Each night the Hill household is
turned into a veritable study hall
as Barbara, George, and Mike
“hit the books.” They take turns

driving to and from school each ‘

day in their own automobile.
Oddly enough, each is enrolled

in _a different school of the Uni-

versity. Barbara, who graduated

from Mt. Mercy Academy, is a‘

Spanish major in the College,
George studies industrial engi-
neering, while Mike is in the
School of Business Administra-
tion.

The two brothers represent over

four years of military service. -_
Mike was a corporal ‘with the ski

troops in Italy and served «alto-
gether two and one-half years,
while George spent two years as
a coxswain in the Navy. Most of
his service was in China.

Mike graduated from Aspinwall
high school and George from St.
V_incent’s prepischool. All three
of the Hills plan to go into the'ad-

(Editor’s note: Notices and news
of interest to veterans will be
printed from time to time in this
column. It is designed to help
veteran students as much as pos-
sible as they pursue their courses
of study-at the University.)

As- a result of numerous re-
quests from students the Veterans
Administration set-up at the
University will be herein clari-
ﬂed. There has been some con-
fusion as . to what each _ oﬂice
handling Veteran affairs in the
University does.

The University’s oﬂice of vet-.
eran affairs is centralized in the
oﬁice of the Dean of Men, 801
Cathedral of Learning, where Mr.
Edward J. Richart, assistant to the
Dean and special counsellor ‘to
veterans, is in -charge. Through
this oﬁice is cleared all matters
' between the University and the
"eteran. Although not a branch
of the Veterans Administration
this oﬂice has been set up to aid
eterans in scholastic problems.
Besideskeeping individual ﬁles on
” ’ students, this oﬂice helps in

     
 

    

in an advisory capacity for Uni-

versity problems.

The Veteran’s Guidance center
is located in 3017 C1. Dr. Amar C.
Held, professor of psychology, is
in charge of this veteran coun-
selling center. Mr. Howard Blank
is the veteran in charge. In this
center are cleared matters. of, V0-
cational guidance and preference.

Problems on subsistence and
related. subjects are handled in
the training office in Room 821 C1.
This section, under the supervis-
ion of Mr. Elwood M. Humphrey,
training oﬂicer, maintains liaison
with the main VA office in Oak-
land and serves as an advisor
group to Public Law 16 vets.

Questions concerning insurance
and other non-scholastic problems
should be taken to the VA oﬂice
in the Fulton building down-
town. ’

Pitt’s B Team
In Four Tilts

The Panther “B” grid squad,
coached by Ralph Mitterling and
Rudy Gradisek, opened their 1946
schedule Saturday by bowing to
the Ohio State B’s, 32-8. The con-
test, originally booked at the As-
pinwall Vets’ Hospital, was trans-
ferred to Columbus because of the
local strike situation.

Three more tilts remain on the
B schedule. They will meet Navy
at Annapolis on October 26, fol-
lowed by a return engagement
with th hio State eleven on No-
vember _at the stadium. A fray
with Kiski at Saltsburg on No-
vember 28 will round out the
brief card.’ '

dmen Bid»For Second Win

by AL ROTH

Editor

, will be tossed aside this week-

end when lVes Fcslei-’s Pitt‘Panthers seek their second win of

the season at Pitt Stadium.

The Pitt coach will send_his injury-riddled squad into bat-
tle against arugged, aggressive Temple University eleven. The
Blue and Gold disability list, which has been rather lengthy

since the beginning of fall prac-
tice, took on added names last
weekend following the Notre
Dame tilt. I

The 33-0 defeat suffered by the
Pitt gridders revealed the Irish’s
strength in touchdowns but dis-
closes nothing concerning the
manner in which the burly Green
and White veterans manhandled
the young Panthers.

However, -the patch-quilt Pitt
lineup have vowed that they will
not make the mistake made by
their teammates last fall when the
Templars were taken much too
lightly. Last years contest, con-
sidered nothing but a breather,
ended Temple 6, Pitt 0.

The starting lineup against the
Ray Morrison—coached aggrega-
tion will ﬁnd at least two changes
from that which was in for the
kickoff against Notre Dame. Henry
“Clip” Clougherty, a dependable
veteran, will get the nod for the
center job, replacing Lee Ward, a
casualty in last week’s game.

ably surrender the spot to Matt
Gebel for tomorrow’s game. Ge-
bel, a senior from East Pittsburgh,
moved off the bench for the ﬁrst
time this season on Saturady af-
ternoon and turned in an admir-
able performance.

The Templars have been in ac-
tion twice. They tied Southern
Methodist, 7-7, and fell before
Georgia University, last Friday

night.

The Notre Dante ‘eleven,
whose fury the Panthers felt
last Saturday afternoon, left a
tremendous impression on the
Pitt coaching squad. A local
sportscribe asked Head Coach
Wes_Fes'ler, “What men on the .
Notre Dame squad look like

Wes?” Fesler’s curt reply was,
“All of them,”-—and he wasn’t

A recent directive from Naval

The new directive applies to Navy
veterans and those who have been
unable to enlist because of a lack
of recruiting facilities in their
home towns.

Members 01' the Naval Reserve
are donating their services as re-
cruiting officers to enable Navy
veterans to reestablish their aﬂ‘il-

list ‘for inactive duty with the
Naval Reserve.

The Pittsburgh Organized Naval

tions needed are DET, ET, E, C,
MC, and HC. Among those ratings

While wandering about these
hallowed halls searching in vain
for a deserted corner in which to
dump our books we chanced upon
the News’ oﬁice. To pay our board
we’re pounding out this (you’ll
have a more expressive word)
banter. ‘ 

Slumming in the Fiji corner we
noticed Dave Mayhew's “piece-a-
tin” resting comfortably on
Phylis Osterling’s sweat; .

Vera Montgomery is one among
the returning horde, but unique
is she in that all ex-Waves can’t
claim a spouse like Al Harston as
a service souvenir.

Mary Kash and Mike Costello
. . . that’s the scheme of things
since the last choir trip threw
their passions into a mutual bent.

Emogene Strong anticipate a

big Philly weekend featuring the
Penn—Dart_mouth fracus, with a
law school social and hJ1Se party
with hger favorite hunk of man.

And while we’re at it, any info
on the private life of George, the
Mule, Mueller will be relished
and handed on to the Pitt public
in all of its presumably "sordid
detail. ' V

Confident that we have a place
to rest, and the rent’s cheap con-
sidering current standards, we’ll
take off for greener pastures un-
til next week.
