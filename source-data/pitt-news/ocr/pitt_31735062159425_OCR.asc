Christmas Tree Spirit
Lights Up University

Santa Claus and lavish decorations keynote Pitt’s Christmas
this year. Every available bit of University space has been fes-
tooned and lighted for the holidays. In the midst of it all, Edwin
Peterson, professor of English and perennial Pitt Santa Claus,
will park his sleigh in the Commons Room at 3:30 p.m. to hand
out gifts garnished with Choice comments.

Last Christmas, Peterson, as a
sage Santa, had’something in his
pack for all, students, faculty,
organizations,‘ and administration.

Christmas Everywhere

Tree lights and traditional red
and green Christmas colors have
not been spared in the buildings.
For the first time this year Com-
mons Room Council has put lights
on the eight trees in the room.

W'ith the organ playing daily be-
tween classes, the Commons Room
has been in the Christmas center
in theschool. Evelyn Dwyer, Gar-
net Friedly, Bob Ziegler, Carl
Angstrom, and Dick, Stricker have
been alternating at the keyboard.

3rd Panther

 Sellout

¢.

The Panther swept the newstands
Wednesdayin keeping with its sell-
out tradition set by its last’ two
editions, according to Ralph Doug-
las, business manager.

Between the hours of S a.m. and

11:30 a.m. the bulk of 3200 copies
were sold.
,_ Among the most popular features
were Campus Candids, the center
page photo spread, the jokes "Good
but Stale,” and “Economics in a
Changing World.”

, Kappa Kappa Gamma removed the
Panther cup for selling the most
magazines from the Chi Omega’s
mantle. Running a close second in
the sales were the Tri Sigma sig-
ma’s. The incumbents took third
place.

Frosh Dinks
Here to Stay

The dink program will be main-
tained next semester for‘entering
freshman men, Men’s Council ruled
at its meeting Tuesday.

Council voted unanimously to
continue this feature of the fresh-
man orientation program. Included
in the motion is the maintenance of
the present custcms and traditions
committee, presided over by «Joe
Wolfe, to direct next semester’s
program.

Program Evaluation

Wolfe reported that a complgte
evaluation of all aspects of fresh-
man orientation will be made with
a view toward the improvement of
next semester’s program.

Another highlight of the Tuesday’s
MC meeting was a motion to send

not attended meetings regularly.
The absent members will be required
to state their reasons and explain
their future status in Council.

System Stands

The athletic committee ruled that
the present system of awarding let-
ters would have to stand at this
time, though they expressed appro-
val of Council’s interest in the mat-
ter.

Football and cross-country let-
ters were awarded at the letterrnen’s
banquet. Letters for spring and win-
ter sports are awarded privately,
but the athletic office desires to
change this system.

Gym Walls
Hold Firm

Dr. John Weber, secretary of the
University, is optimistic about the
possibility that Trees Gym will be
re-opened. The cracks in the wall
and on the boiler-room floor have
not become any worse since Dec. 8
when the gym was padlocked, he
said. I

The cracks had been caused by
liquid cement which is being pumped
into aniold mine shaft under the hill
behind Trees to provide a firm foun-
dation for the proposed 1"-story
Veteran's Hospital to be ‘built there.

The cement, under pressure, was
unsettling the gym foundation. As a
safety measure Dr. Weber ordered
it closed until after the Christmas
vacation, when the pumping will be
finished.

If the gym is not re-opened, gym

classes may be heldin the Stadium,
W according to Dr. Weber. Definite
arrangements will have to wait for
the results of the final investiga-
tion during the holidays. Notices
will be posted on campus bulletin
boards when clas ses start in Jan-
uary.

Logan Armory has been obtained
to ease the IM basketball crisis.

SKS News   RETRACTION

Group Scores Reporting A I

And Publicity

Men’s Council representative to‘
Congress. In his original motion,
Greenberger asked for a "public
apology” but-‘after several revis-
ions the demand was modified to
"retraction.”

According to Greenberger, a
statement he made at the Nov. 28
Congressional meeting was dis-
torted, causing "great harm" to
the faculty rating committee and
"serious repercussions to the
program.”

Objects to-“Forced"

He objected to the word "forced”
in the quotation, "The test wouldn't
be any good unless the majority of
departments were -forced to use
it." Greenberger insisted that he
said "cooperated” not "forced.”

Before a vote was taken on the
motion several other congressmen
voiced their. displeasure at the
policy of the News. One member of
the legislature accused the News
of the lack of publicity for Con-

Theft Victim  

Recovering,

Mrs. Ruth Knight, an employee
of the University's Psychiatric In-
stitute and Clinic who was shotand
wounded by a robber Tuesday night,
is reported to be in good condition
in Presbyterian Hospital. When con-
tacted Wednesday afternoon,iMrs.
Knight said she was “good.”

So far, police have no clues to
the identity of the bandit.

Mrs‘. Knight, 42, of 30 Sampson
Ave., Ingram, was struck by the
bullet in her right leg.

Mrs. Knight ran up a ramp toward
a door in the hospital. As she reached
the door, which was locked, the
bandit fired. The robber fled as
Mrs. Knight, who uses a cane,
dropped beside the door.

An awakening interest in stu-
dent-faculty relations and the newly
innovated Blennds suggested the
question, "Should teachers be rated
or graded by their students?” In
this poll both students and faculty
members were approached.

Elaine Pelaez, College 53: "It
would be good to have seminars to
discuss with teachers points upon
which you think their instructicin
could be improved.”

Don Marshall, Engineer 52: "Yes.
The ratings should be available on
prepared sheets to the students.”

Albert William Bendig, M.S., in-
structor in psychology: "Definitely.
In -fact I should encourage it.”

Joan Planert, College 50: "No,
I don’t think students should rate
teachers. It‘isn’t'up to us. They are
not the ones who are trying to get
the education.” ,

Bob Gall, Bus Ad 51: "Yes be-
cause faculty rates students.There
should be reciprocal action.”

Elizabeth Clark, Education 51:

the criticism was constructive. It

ing that “great harm" had been done to Congress’ faculty rat-
g program because he claimed he had been misquoted. Speaking

going on, several other legislators inserted their two-cents worth.

‘a They bewailed "poor reporting” and a ‘flack of publicity” on
he part of the News toward Corigress and its activities.~This is
1.0 the first time the News has heard these complaints. We have,
owever, yet to be presented with a good case against us or any

pp: The other gripe, an attack on the lack of publicity the News
.ran_ts a Congress that is publicity-conscious, but only when the
"blicity is favorable, is one which distinguishes a controlled

«. We aimtp be a newspaper. _If wewere faced with operating a
icity sheet, a situation far from uncommon among college news-
rs, we would quickly step aside in favor of_ a staff of puppets.

7 This is not to deny that a college newspaper, or any news-
‘per for that matter, has, to a certain degree, an informational
tvii'ce‘job to do. We instituted the "Bulletin Board” to reinforce
at ‘purpose. The limitations of space“ and importance still pre-
ail, however. Evenwith the "Bulletin Board” running over a
u<lliii1.side page, copy is still squeezed out. , ‘

I Congress material is not the only copy forced out of the News
of occasions. Nor is Congress the only group to complain tous.
hut that body actually has less grounds for complaint than many
y-thersi around school. It is only when some of ‘its business or pro-

In an interview with Ma.urice—Braunqstein, president of Pi

Lambda Phi fraternity, an answer,
or an almost-answer, came up, '

The Pi Larns are non—sectiarian
on a national scale, while sectar-
ian locally.

Succeeds Some Places

Braunstein pointed oiut that the
non-sectarian chapters are found
for the most part at small,‘-lcampus
schools. ”There’s no doubt of
their success," he added. , I ,
, "The reason ‘'for their success
seemed to lie in the fact that when
a student goes away to school, he
goes looking for new‘frie‘nds‘“and
and new experiences.

The circumstances are not the
same, of course,’at Pitt where the
majority» of students commute from
home to school". , ’

This reporter remembers the
reply given to him by a friend when
the friend wasiqueried on why he
went fraternity. "They’re the same,
guys that I've hung around with all
my life. "I just thought‘ I’d sti%“k

In His Upbringing'

One of the disadvantages, or

advantages depending on the stu-
dent’s own personality, of going

of the society under which he has
spent his first eighteen years.
When he comes to a university
located five blocks or one-half
mile from his home, he has no de-
sire, actually no need, to make

new contacts and/or todiscover

a new pattern of living. »

Fraternities at Pitt are concerned
mainly, as they should be, with
offering the student a well-rounded
social life. They are not primarily
organizations of ideal-ists.
A To accomplish this first end
fraternities can't buck the student’s
environment. They can't buck the ‘
home ties which prohibit the Protes-
tant from associating with the Jew,
and the Jew with the Negro.‘Nor
can they buck‘ the student’s acquir-
ed reluctance to branch from his
own group. '

Should Work on It

It all boils down to fraternities
not being the instrument to change
‘ society, but an extension of society.‘
They can and do, however,:work~

within the scope of their activities

to lessen the amomt of prejudice
on a college level. IF affairs can.
neverbe; accused of being planned
by committees of entirely one group.
Representation in student govern-
ment, which is controlled by IF on
the strength of the fact that only
frat men vote, cannot be called
limited to one group. S

I iT'his column should not be mis-
construed as a defense of discrim-
ination. It is an attempt to explain
the position of fraternities on the

issue. Discrimination has got to be
stopped somewhere, but that oppos-
ition has to come a little earlier
than in college.

Band Review ’

Thrills 1600

By BILL SCRIVO

The Varsity Marching Band had
a baker’s dozen of stirring musical
arrangements in the twelve selec-
tions they played at their 1949
Stadium Review at Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial Tuesday evening.

A For about 50 band membersrwho
will graduate before next September
it was the last public appearance.
It was an appearance that the ap-
proximately 1600 listeners will
remember.

Of special note, was the run-
down of the season's scores by
Band Announcer Paul Lohmeyer,
with appropriate sound effects
by the Band.

The Band also played excerpts
from all their Stadium halftime

performance__s, under the baton of -

Robert L. Arthur, band director.

Other highlights were the Bands
arrangement of “South Rampart
Street March,” directed by Ben
E. Benack, assistant director, and
“Tiger Rag,” also directed by Mr.
Benack.

failed us in the approach to modern
marriag ?”

.Of the students polled, over two-

discussed in seminars during Reli-
gion-in-Life Week, Jan. 15 to 19.

A cross-section of all student
thought was obtained by distribut-
ing ballots to men and women of
every schoolland class and of the
ghree major faiths represented in
the University.

"Marian Ford, chairman of the
arrangements committee which took
the poll, reports that the question
"Do religion and science agree?”
is second inimportance to the mar-
riage topic. ‘

The third greatest number of
votes were cast for a discussion of
the principles of‘ different religions.
Following this in the balloting were
the questions "Do politics and reli-
gion mix?” and "How do you know
right from wrong?” C

These five topics will constitute
the bulk of the seminar discussions,
which will be held during Religion-
in-Life Week. These seminars are
open to all students.

MC Asks Chancellor

By LEN BAKER

"The need for additional recreational space” has prompted
Men’s Council to write Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald requesting
that room 817 C1. be turned into a lounge for men students.

Howard Greenberger, president of Men’s Council, envisions
the proposed lounge as containing a television set, ping pong
tables, and other recreational facilities.

Roy Nelson, who headed the
committee which drew up the letter,"
said that Council isseeking to ob-.
tain "the use of the eighth floor
room because of the need for addi-
tlonal recreational space at Pitt
and the ideal location of the room.”

The letter also claims that the

then that’s another matter.

One of the best independent basketball players in
this district for over a decade, many a shoe has been
worn out trying t_o keep pace with Al. He has played
with and against some of the top college stars in the
nation including Moe Becker of Duquesne, Manny Gor-
man of NYU, and George Haines of Bucknell.

Schrecker had graduated from Fifth Avenue High --
where, strangely enough, he didn't play’ any basketball
-- when he attracted college coaches with his playing

ability in the independent ranks.
Sought by Pitt

Doc Carlson tried to get him to enter Pitt while he
was working as an elevator operator here, but Al
couldn’t see it. He also had offers to enter Duquesne
and Indiana University but turned them down, too.

When he received an offer from Carnegie Tech,
Schrecker finally decided to give college life a try.
But then his father died and he had to give up the
idea and keep working to help support his mother.

"It's hard to remember how many teams I’ve played
for,"’ Al says, "but I did play for the Pittsburgh Pros,
Irene Kaufmann Settlement, Gurrentz Packers and the

McKeesport Big Five.”

Five Straight Titles’
While playing with the Settlement, his team won
. the AAU-AMA championship from 1938 through 1942.
The six foot one inch Schrecker played forward and
center, and was a leading scorer and all-around floor

man.

Now, 31, Al has retired from the game as an active W
player but still officiates independent games and *
serves as a gym instructor at Taylor Allderdice Even-

ing School twice a week.

Schrecker says that he likes to officiate and has
never gotten into any serious squabbles with fans or

players.

game nowadays is the last two minutes. Thavs when

Like some other observers, Al thinks that basket-

most impossible to catch up with the other team.

New Ticket, System Set Up  
For Basketball Admissions

Admission to Pitt’\§i“basketball games this year will be by student
activity cards instead of by the old system whereby students received
tickets beforehand at the Student Desk. -

Frank Carver, Pitt's graduate manager of athletics, announced that
admission will be conducted on a first come, first served basis, similar

to the setup at football games,

The new system will be put into

passing out of tickets by students
which occurred last year.

Unsuspecting Hoop Oficial
Strolls Through Tilting Gym

Intramural Director Leo Bemis has secured the use of the
Logan Armory Gym as a partial relief for the intramural basketball
headache brought on by the almost certain official condemnation

of Trees Gym.

The Armory is located at O'Hara
and Thackeray streets.

The Armory is allowing the Uni-
versity to use the Armory court
five afternoons a week permitting
the playing of three games a day.

However, even with the limited
use of the Cathedral and Stadium
floors, Bemis found it impossible
to run off any regular IM schedule.

Elimination Tourney

_.Depending, upon the number of
entries, either a single or double
eliminations tournament will suffice
for the usual schedule pattern.
Fraternity eliminations will prob-
ably begin immediately after the
holiday recess.

Bemis has called a meeting for
Wednesday, ]an. 4, in room 304
C1 for any independent outfit in-
terested in entering thetournament.

No Song Here
V Meanwhile, the Trees Gym crisis
finds at least ,one IM official who
isn’t singing “And the Walls Came
Tumbling Down.” ‘

He’sSol Toder, a student official
from Cannonsburg.

Solly was scheduled to officiate
some IM games at Trees Gym last
Friday. He did not know that the
ancient gym had literally cracked
up, and that it was now condemned.

He also did not know that Carl
Olson, Leo Bemis, and the test
of the Gym staff had been hustled
out of the building because of the
danger of its complete coll'ap‘se.

Walked Riglt In

When Solly arrived, the door was
open, so he walked in. He couldn’t
understand why the building was
empty so he went up to Bemis’

   
   
 
 
  

   
   
   
  
  
   
    
  
   
  
   
   
  
 
   
   
   
  
  
  
   
   
  
  
   
    
    
   
  
   
  
  
   
 

office. Open folders, and paper in
the typewriter failed to make their
impression on Solly.
So Solly called Mr. Bemis. The
IM head explained that all basket-
ball games had been called off,
and that he was sorry that he had
been unable to contact Solly to let
him know. .
After a few more minutes of con-
versation, Bemis causually asked
Solly where he was calling from.
Lets Out shriek
When Solly innocently replied,
“Trees,” Bemis let out a shriek,
"Get the hell out of there before it
ca_ves in, or before‘ the watchmen
lock you in.”
The intramural office is happy to
report that Sol Toder’s name is
still on the active officiating list.

_AnEducational   W.
  Pattern

Sports Editor

There are administrators in the University family who could take a
lesson from Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald’s recent expression of opin-

ion on college athletic codes.

A wire service reporter asked him what he thought about the matter,

and the Chancellor replied ‘that he
thought all schools should follow
a uniform set of eligibility and aid-

_ to-athletes rules.

The most interesting point about
the business is not Dr. Fitzgerald’s
opinion, but‘the fact that he ex-
pressed it. There are employees in
-the Cathedral who will not tell you
the time of day without an OK from
the publicity office.

But,‘then, the News never has
found Dr. Fitzgerald a slippery
article. The man is asked his opin-
ion on a much-discussed problem,
so he gives it.

Throughout the Cathedral are
scattered various persons whom

,you could question on subjects

which are extensively reflected

ion by high school debators, yet

these educators will sit back and
tell you, "Why, I really haVen’t
thought about the matter,” or “I
couldn’t say off hand.”

His Own Boss

Of course, the Chancellor is
his own boss, so it may seem more
convenient for him to speak his
mind than for the others to do so.
Remember, however, that there are
many who object to college'presi-

dents or chancellors butting into’

athletic department business.
Dr. Fitzgerald, himself an ex-
grid coach and athletic director,

V made it clear that he was express-

ing only his personal views and
that itwas not a part of University

athletic policy.

There are many Pitt administrators
who, like the Chancellor, refuse to
have their minds mistaken for bare

whatever unfavorable
has been given Pitt.
During an interview I once asked
Giovanni Romagnoli, the Italian
painter who did the Italian Room
fresco, whether he came from a
wealthy family. A University per-
son, who was sitting in on the in-

publicity

terview as a sort of sentry, immed— .

iately cut in with the objection
that the question was irrelevant
and perhaps embarassing.

When the artist was finally able
to get a word in edgewise, he said
that no, he did not mind the ques-
tion. As 'a matter of fact, he con-
tinued, he got his artistic training
in Italy as a result of his father
marrying the daughter of a wealthy
man. '

When his father died there was
still money around to keep the re-
gistrar from the door.

Now it may be a long way from

Italy to sports, but since the Chan-

cellor has exemplified enlightening
expression via sports, it might not
prove a bad stepping stone to other
fields.

No Comment

On Code Plan

Athletic Director Tom Hamilton,
when contacted by the News this
week, had no comment to make on
Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald’s
suggestion for a nationally uniform
athletic code.

He said he had not conferred
with Dr. Fitzgerald on the matter.

The Chancellor has expressed
the opinion that all schools should
follow one set of rules governingé,
eligibility and aid to athletes. He
has pointed out that the proposal
is not a part of University policy
but only a personal opinion.

‘Caste’CastCa.stigated,-

 

Current Vehicle Stalls

By BILL SCRIVO
If you can sit through two acts of "Caste,” the Pitt Players
current show at the Stephen Foster Memorial, you deserve a medal.
I sat through the whole play, but I am not eligible for the medal
because I had to. At least I learned that the lighting crew uses
eight spotlights to light the stage, and the Foster stage has a

"pretty red velvet curtain hanging
over it, and that when a dragoon
dies with his boots on, he ain't
necessarily dead.

I am told that the Players drama-
tized this play of dubious value in
order to present a period piece to
student playgoers.I would just say,
“Don't go, period.”

- Set Good

The first act curtain goes up on
a nicely-executed nineteenth-cen-
tury chamber. Then the actors have

to come on and spoil it.

Of course, very few present-day
actors could expect to go far in
this vehicle. ‘And when the hero
Hon. George D’Alroy (Jack Copper-
smith) looks around at his beloved
Esther’s (PLOTS Ostwind) seedy par-
lot and says: "Yes, and this is the
fairy’s fireplace,” that does it.

The melodrama is a tale of a
man who marries beneath his sta-
tion, and in succession; argues
with his mother, is shipped to
India with his regiment, gets listed
as dead, and is, of course, saved
by a Gunga Din, to return to his
wife who has been recently blessed
with a child.

The actors speak with an Eng-
lish accent, but the only one who
is really very successful in the
ruse is Esther’s drunken father,
played by Roy.Titchworth.

Polly ls Parrot-like

Barbara Gluck, as Esther’s vol-
uble sister, Polly, is more than a
trifle high-schoolish in her role.
It is more than a little boring to
‘hear her extensive ranting, not in
very good voice, at that.

-Polly’s beau, the outspoken gas
man, Sam Gerridge (Harry_ H. Kim-
ball) was a rather good touch in the
show. He, at least, does not fall
into the affected acting of most of

I the other Players.

~ amusing,

Ronnie Fowler, as D’Alroy’s
snooty mother also deserves men-
tion as a natural in her part. One
of the most welcome characters
in the play was the butler, Dixon,
(Ben Tatar) who had very little to
say. ‘

Satire or Drama‘?

Most of the time, it was difficult
to decide whether the actors were
trying to be serious or whether they
were burlesqueing the play. __

If they were trying to be serious,
they should have burlesqued the
play. If they were burlesqueing,
they weren't funny at all. i

The real applause must go to
the stagehands, who designed two
very excellent sets, and the’ cos-
tume designers, whose only mis-
_step was to put red and green
patches on Mr. Eccles Sunday suit;
a trifle far-fetched.

Difficult Production

Certainly it was a difficult play
to produce, and, I think, a poor
choice on the Players’ part. Melo-
drama ceased to be anything but
and rarely that, with the
removal of gaslights.

 
   

FRAN NESTLR

Foto PreX__y
Wins Prize

Fran Nestler, president of Pitt
Foto Club, won the $100 first prize
of Camera Magazine's national
photographic contest for his entry,
"Japanese and Nisei.”

Commenting on the story behind
the picture, Nestler, a Bus Ad
senior said: is

"The shot was a grab shot made
from the hip on a Speed Graphic. I
took it just inside the stairway
_leading to the door of the Bhudda
Temple in Los Angeles in 1948.

"It was taken the day before the

 

festival held by thelapanese Ameri-
cans and depicts the tension and
skepticism of those who recently
returned from wartime relocation
camps.” .

Fran also won two of the top
awards in the National Collegiate
Photography Exhibition by taking
"Best of the Show” honors and
first place in the Industrial and
Scientific class.

Kappa Alpha Mu, honorary photo
journalism fraternity, sponsored
the contest. ' ‘
