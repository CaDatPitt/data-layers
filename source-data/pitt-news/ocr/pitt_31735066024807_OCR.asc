What’s a College I.D.

Good F or, Any way?

BY CHRISTINE WILTANGER

Ever wonder what a college l.D. is
good for these days? It certainly
won‘t get you any money—Reagan
and inﬂation took care of that.
There‘s even doubt that carrying one
around gets you an education. And
it certainly won't get you into any
bars in Oakland.

But wait! There‘s some light on
the distant horizon. Yes! I see it! It's
—it’s—ENTERTAlNMENT!!
That's right folks. We all know that
while Mom and Dad are only too
happy to pay for an engineering
degree, they’d prefer not to lay out
bucks for Jr. and Linda Sue to go
out on the town.

Here are a few places which’ll give
students entertainment for less.

In Oakland, the Pittsburgh Play-
house Theater offers all students a
discount on “any live performance
except those on Saturday nights",
according to Playhouse representa-

tive Maura Minteer.

“With a current, validated college
l.D., students can purchase any
ticket for $2.50,”Minteer said.

Regular Theater ticket prices are
$4.00 per ticket for matinees, $6.00 a
ticket for performances on Thurs-
day and Sunday nights, and $7.00
for Friday and Saturday
performances.

“That's the same discount given to
senior citizens,” Minteer said.
Though Minteer warns that “the dis-
count is good only for the purchase
of one ticket per l.D.“

“When the student comes in, upon

,_I‘.'*

The

showing l.D., he or she is given a‘

card with the student’s name and 'a
number printed on it," she
explained. “With that card, the stu-
dent will be able to purchase a ticket
at the reduced rate of $2.50."

The discount of the Playhouse
Theater Center does not extend to
the Playhouse Film Repertory. The
Repertory, best known in the area

for its nightly presentation of older g

1,.» ., ..
» .c . .. ‘ r
.....\ , . -’

Pitt News,

films and film classics, gives dis-
counts only to students associated
with Point Park College, which
owns and runs the Theater and the
Film Repertory.

Both the Playhouse Film Reper-
tory and Theater Center are located
at 222 Craft Avenue, Oakland. For
more information, call 62]-4445.

The Pittsburgh ‘Public Theater,
located on the city’s North Side,
offers student rush tickets, “which
are tickets that are left over and are
sold at a discount one-half hour to
fifteen minutes before showtime,"
says a spokesperson forthe theater.

Pittsburgh Public Theater usually
sells rush tickets for $3.00. The
Theater is located in the Allegheny
Theater Building behind Allegheny
Center Mall and next to Buhl
Planetarium.

Even though they are sold on a
first-come, first-served basis, rush
tickets can offer students an excel-
lent choice of seats, as in the case of
the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera.

“Our rush tickets sell for half-
price. They include any seat in the
house that hasn’t been sold two
hours before the performance,“ said
Ruth Jennets, Ticket Sales Manager
for Opera, Incorporated. Regular
prices range from $22.00 for Grand
Tier and Dress Circle seats to $7.00
for gallery row seats. Information
concerning the availability oftickets

.‘ ’. ‘._:\

can be obtained by calling the Heinz
Hall Box Office at 281-5000.

In addition to offering rush
tickets, the Pittsburgh Symphony
also offers Student Season Sub-
scriptions, which sell for under half

[the regular price of regular season

subscriptions. Students are given the
choice of Thursday or Sunday after-
noon performances. The tickets may
be bought in pairs for each subscrip-
tion, and are offered only in the fall.

More information may be
obtained by calling the Heinz Hall
Box Office. The Symphony is
located in Heinz Hall, downtown.

Student Season Subscriptions for
the Pittsburgh Ballet can be
obtained through the University's
Student Union Ticket Office in
Schenley Hall. Student tickets to
individual performances are also
available at the Student Union
Ticket Window with the presenta-
tion ofa Pitt l.D.

The Pittsburgh chapter of the
American Dance Council offers stu-
dent discounts on a less regular
basis. 0

The Council is responsible for
bringing such programs as “Rod
McKuen and The Dance" and The
Joffrey Ballet to Pittsburgh.

“We usually let the decision of
rush tickets up to the individual
groups," said the Council‘s Kate
Zima. “We don’t have a blanket

Wednefdav. Md)’ ‘20."1'98/ I . . . . . . . . . . . . .

policy.”

Ticket prices vary with the loca-
tion and who the dance company
performing is.

“Performances held at the Play-
house are regularly $7.50, Heinz
Hall tickets are usually $1 L00,"
Zima said.

Local area colleges (Pitt,
Carnegie-Mellon, Duquesne and
Carlow) often sell tickets to their
own events at a special student dis-
count to people from other colleges.
Proof of validation in addition to
l.D. may also be required.

If sports are more appealing, the
Pittsburgh Pirates organization
occasionally offers student discount
rates on a home game by home game
basis.

In the past, the former World
Champions have offered ‘College
Student Night’, when a regular
ticket can be bought for $1.00 upon
presentation of a validated l.D.

For students who are more self-
improvement oriented, Your
Father's Mustache, a hair styling
salon located in Oakland on Forbes
Avenue, offers all students a dis-
count for those willing to come in
and pick up a discount card. ,

While the l.D. won’t keep stu-
dentsout of the military anymore,
and it certainly won’t get students a
job, it can help cut costs a bit.

At least it gets us something.

Since the People‘s Republic of
China reopened its door to the Uni-
ted States ten years ago, develop-
ment of trade, cultural, and security
relations between the two nations
have progressed dramatically.

However, the PRC is still recoil-
ing from the devastating effects of
Mao’s Great ‘Leap Forward; it is
caught in a precarious balance
between the two superpowers; it has
to keep one eye on conflict in Sou-
theast Asia where she perceives the
Soviets as trying to maintain a

stronghold; and, it is uneasy about ‘

the status of Taiwan as well as vast
cultural and political differences
with the US. prevail.

These were the major theises ofa
three—day symposium on
-China Factor", sponsored by the
University Center for International

“nil uc

Studies on May l4,l5,yand 16.

Michael A. Armacost, deputy
assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific Affairs speaking
Friday night to 75 people in the Law
School Auditorium noted that since
the Nixon/Kissinger-‘Chou En Lai
accords ten yearsago, relations have

1 «been markedby “‘mﬂat'ed expecta-
. tions and’ ill,-fated fears,” but recon-

ciliation has been based. on
_“convergent national interests and
an awareness of strategic dangers.”

These common interests include
the security of Thailand and a reso-

lution of the KampucheaAn'

intervention.

Armacost said that the balance of
power strategies of the two nations

must be basedfon separate but p’aral- ’ '
lel strategies,‘>‘to'se_ek to coerce oth-

ers to do tlﬁﬁidding" in Southeast

Asia and “posing obstacles to Soviet V

adventurism.”

He said relations have been based
on a “realistic appraisal of the Chi-
neseg market and consultation with

the PRC‘on global, environmental, :

and political issues."

He said in*.tl'1e‘,.f_uture the two”
nations “must*~-“work together’ to_
assure our,policies are built on mu-
tual interests . to *survive~ future
change.”   : M _-

But he cautionedithat the US.
and PRC are not engaged in an
alliance and.“we must not use China
as a club to beat the Soviet Union.”

Policy and International Business.‘

Chou said that China has made
great advances in recent years, but
due to its “leftist tendency" the
emphasis on modernization and
capital projects has led to a foreign
deficit and inflation after the Great
Leap Forward.

The PRC, he said, has entered a
period of “healthy and sober read-
justment” which will stress con-
sumer goods and light industry, and

 

taking care of'its 80 per cent peasant
apopulation. This may restrict the '

'_ import of “large sets ofequipment"

‘and thatlong term trade will depend

\-on long term economic prospects, I ,

Chou said. - _ '
“The scope of cooperation
(between the U.S. and the PRC)
_con(tinues to ‘widen rather than
shrink, depending on whatever
terms are favorable," he added.
Speaking on'“The American.Fac-
tor in Chinese Policy,” on Saturday, '
Yao Wei of the Woodrow Wilson
Centerifor International Studies
said that compared with other coun-

_.tries. “China’s relations withithe.

Clean Air Act rally at Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial Hall stressed the
need for unity among labor and
environmental groups and criticized
the Reagan administration for
“turning back the clock“ on worker
safety and environmental health
issues.

The rally was organized by the
local section of the OSHA/' Envir-
onmental Network. a coalition of
unions and environmental groups in
20 states focusing on protecting the
Occupational Safety and Health Act
from what they believeare harmful
policies of the Reagan administra-
tion. and support of the Clean Air
Act, which comes up for review in
Congress this year.

Howard Samuel, President of the
industrial Union Department ofthe
AFL-C10, said that Reagan’s “man-
date is exaggerated.” and that opin-
ion polls show wide support for
safety and environmental
regulations.

Samuel disputed Reagan’s claim
of trying to increase productivity by
easing regulation, saying that Amer-
ican productivity has gone up in the
past decade, and that “our produc-
tivity is still the highest in the
world.” *

Most regulations have\actually'

helped industry, Samuel said, by
forcing modernization and new
technology which makes a company
mo.re competitive.

He called cost-benefit analysis of
regulation “nonsense”. “You cannot
takes lives and dollars and. do
mathematics with them,” Samuel
said. '

Joe Fontaine, national president
of the Sierra Club, continued the
theme oflabor-environmental unity,
saying that “environmental (groups)
and labor do have the same goals.”
But he warned 9‘f,{ugppp§,i_tion
attempts to divide-and-conquer the
two groups.

He also ‘said that “we need to

improve the Clean Air Act; we need
better enforcement."

Jack Sheehan, United Steel-
workers Legislative Director, said
that Reagan proposals to reduce
OSHA funding are “an attack on
human rights.” The OSHA/Envir-
onmental Network is trying to coun-

ter presidential policy by “defending ,
legislative commitment," he said.

He mentioned Western Pennsyl-

vania congressmen who serve on
labor and environmental commit-
tees, and said they should be
lobbied. '

Criticizing what he called “envir-
onmental blackmail,” Sheehan said
that workers should not have to
choose between their health and
their job—that no plant has to shut
down because of regulation. Shee-
han agreed with Samuel that regula-
tion improves productivity. \

Henderson warned corporations
that they will face continued legal
action “unless they clean up now.”

Michelle Tingling of the Urban
Environment Conference in
Washington, D.C., said that a union
of labor and environmental groups
is,needed because “a house divided
cannot stand." Tingling also
emphasized the need for lobbying
politicians.

“Make them accountable to you,”

Radford said‘ that women are
twice as risk-prone as men, and that‘
younger workers are more invdanger
from exposure to radiation ‘on the
job than older men, and that this
creates problems of uniform
standards. ' M ‘

“i would prefer to see strict limits

Radford ‘said’ lie does not believe

that, as some suggest, tighter regula- .

to the next, radiation exposure
differs by a variable factor of five.

“One thing occupational health
people realize: people can be pro-
tected and still earn‘their daily
bread." he said. ' ‘

Radford said there should be
more studies in the field of the
dangers of radiation.

“Thirty-one years after the first

study were still getting arguments," '

he said.

Cyril Wecht, to many Pittsburghers, is like pineapple sun-
daes: either to be loved ‘or hated. To those in the former
category, yesterday’s verdict in the Dauphin County Court-
house was a reason for celebration; the rest may claim unfair
justice. ' - _

But perhaps the real news behind the innocent verdict was
not the decision itself, but the characters involved. Ironically,
yesterday was also decision day for endorsed Democratic can-
didate Joshua Perper—endorsed by the Democratic machine
which Wecht heads, for the position of County Coroner, on
which Wecht’s trial centered. Wecht, who is difficult to des-
cribe as anything but pompous, may be succeeded_by Perper,
who got into a shoving match with Dr. Sanford Edberg, who
tried to have Perper ar'rested.

The soap opera deepens’: Wecht called Perper a liar-—under
oath—'in his trial. How Perper got the endorsement will be
saved for another install-ment of “As the Morgue Turns.”

Perhaps it is ﬂippant to describe this important issue as

. melodrama. But we are give__ little choice: these are grown men,
all with medical degrees. While the trial we have witnessed in ‘

the past months may reinforce our belief in the judicial
system—good or bad—and yesterday’_s vote may strengthen
our conviction of democracy in action—again, good or bad-—
.the childish violence of two men pushing each other destroys
all that. The issue of who isito run the very important post of
Coroner (and how'it was run in the past), is clouded by the
sophomoric personalities of three highly-educated men.
There_is a third, and again vitally important, issue here. The
treatment that Cyril Wecht has received in the two localpapers
has‘ been anything but fair: one Press article reported that a
charge against Wecht was dropped “merely” because the Sta-
tute of Limitations had run out. The Statute of Limitations

guarantees a fair and speedy trial, which sounds vaguely like .

the Bill of Rights. The hammerhead headline on today’s Post-
Gazette; Reasonable Doubt: Jurors’ Suspicions Aroused By
Failure to Call Two K,ey Witnesses. It’s hard to avoid the
impression that Wecht got offdue to negligence ofthe-pr_osecu-
tion instead of innocence.‘ I

It is impossible, as was‘stated before, to feel indifferent

I about Wecht. But if any objectivity is required, one would

certainly imaginethat the print media would be the candidate.
There is a ripple effect of bad journalism—it gives a tainted
reputation to all those newspapers ever printed. The Press and
Post-Gazette may be the ones on trial next."

Perhaps all this is superfluous. The decision yesterday in
Dauphin County was anti-climactic to the trial; the people’s
vote in yesterday’s primary was only a fore-runner to
November; and the local media will have to fight over other

' battles’ in the future. But if the events of yesterday and the past '

few,_months are any indication "of what’s to come, thenperhaps
could be ‘placed on that.'Nove_

Bitter Attitudes and Closed Minds

By MARK COLLINS

Billie Jean King’s recent disclo-
sure about a lesbian love affair she
had in the early 70’s has sparked
someexpected reactions—someone
referred to her as Billie Joe King,
and a joke circulated for a while
about Billie Jean playing a mixed
singles match with Renee Richards.
I‘m surprised, though, at the bitter
attitudes some have adopted: Ms.
King has been dropped by one spon-
sor, is being reconsidered by
another, and a straw poll on KQV
radio concerning her‘ ability to
represent any product showed many
listeners had left her for dead.

This surprised me for a reason. in
high school I was a ballboy for the
short-lived Pittsburgh Triangles ten-
nis team. ltlwas my first exposure to
anyone celebrated; the shock . of
meeting Evonne Goologong barely
subsided before I met Ms. King.
What struck me, though, wasn’t the
difference between “us and them,”

On May I4, the United States
Senate Foreign Relaﬁons Commit-
tee voted to exempt Pakistan from
the Symington Amendment, which
bars aid to nations which do not re-
nounce nuclear proliferation. Pak-
istan is currently in‘ an arms race
with her arch-rival India to achieve
nuclear. .capacity’. The exemption
will open the door for $ l00.6 million
in military and non-military aid,
starting in October. The Adminis-
tration envisions extending Pakis-
tan $2.5 billion overthe next five
years.

Apparently, “personal liberty and

McClorey and his daughter

The war in Vietnam, it has been
said,  a television war. Each
night, Americans turned on their
sets to the reality of actual combat,
no longer protected by statistics, dis-
patches; facts. Rationalizations
were offered, and official statements
were made, but it was "the images
that lasted. They were always there.

_ In Northern Ireland, there are
images too: angry crowds, plastic
bullets‘, British soldiers. But these

if images do not grasp and reflect the

complex, difficult situation that
exists in Northern Ireland. To do

this requires_a certain perception, a

knowledge of what is actually occur— '

ing and why» For Shawn McClorey,

2 a rnaniwho has spent much of his life
I tangled’ in the Irish struggle, this is

an all too familiar area. /

. e. ’. McClorey, 28, is a Pitt student
 who came here from Ireland I9 f

‘ months.‘ ago to study economics and

.promote Irish industrial develop-

ment in America. Now he live, in a

' comfortable suburban community

a with his wife andtwo small children,

and in conversation mentions places

easily ‘recognizable to Irish-"

"Americans living in _Pittsburg_h, like '

‘";G’allagher’s Pub or Father

‘ Q'Rourke_and St. Mary’s Church.

His quiet life. in Pittsburgh, how-

 ever,»is not reflectiveof his past ‘in

Ireland.

McClorey said the recent prob-
lems. in Northern Ireland stemmed
from what he termed “a belligerent

response” by the Unionist (Protest- A
ant) establishment to a Nationalist,

civil rights march in Northern Ire-
land in ‘I968. ,The~Nationalists. or

’ Stone photo

a

stabulary, which are ofﬁciaI~No-rth-,

.ern Ireland paramilitary police

forces, began to charge the peaceful.
marchers in the face of the television
cameras. The_attention, of the world
media became focusedon that issue
at that time, “-and this was a gross

made to do so, it came as too little,
too late, McClorey said.

As a result, there was a growing
surge of Nationalism at the time,
according to McClorey, and the
IRA began to regroup and regener-
ate from its dormancy in the l950’s.
It split into two wings: the-tradi-
tional wing, which was Marxist-
oriented, persuaded toward political
action and inclined to working
within the constitutional frame-
work; and the provisional "wing,
which was not effectively formed
until January, I970.

In August of I969. the British
army was introduced to the streets of
Northern Ireland.‘ The British army
acted as an aid to the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, who were finding it
increasingly difficult to control
Nationalist resistance, according to
McClorey. _

“They were introduced as an aid
to the civil power, contrary to the

popular notion that they were sent ,

to protect Catholics from rampag-
ing Orange and Protestant hordes,"
McClorey said. “That’s one of the
major. misconceptions in this
country.”

The British army established a

curfew for an area of Belfast in I970.
People were not permitted to leave
their houses for any reason, night

and day. The British army began a
house-to-house search to discover__

any weapons, McClorey said, but
women from other areas of Belfast

wheeled provisions into the area to”

sustain people for the length of the
curfew, then wheeled_the weapons

out on their returnjourney, thereby ‘
. protecting most ofthe weaponry.

‘‘‘It became allthe more obvious
that Britain was there to maintain
her colonial domination in Ireland,"
McClorey said. “ffherefore, it was,
downhill all the way because the
provisional IRA and the British
army began to engage in open con-
flict almiast daily.”

McClorey characterized the
IRA’s. provisional. wing ‘as “an
extremely militant body." He "said,
the reasn for the split in the IRA in
l_969ivwas that British specialists,
with ‘the-"aid of: Unionist mobs,

  iNorthern Ireland

In August of 1969, the
British army was intro-
duced to the streets of

Northern Ireland. The‘

British army acted as
an aid to the Royal Uls-
ter Constabulary.

McClorey said the people of Belfast

 felt let down by this. Some of-the

lRA’s more militant members. and
some of the members who had left
when the IRA began leaning toward
Marxism, started to organize a mil-

itaristic defense. of’ the Belfast

-Catholics. McClorey‘ said.

_-They became equipped‘ rapidly,
since they were sustained,‘ in part, by
the United States, ‘and “it just‘
became a~straight one-on-one fight

9» with the ar_1cient“foe,” -McClorey

said._ A He_ added, howeve’r,~_ that

The Inside Story

McClorey said that Sands’ deci-
sion to embark on a hunger strike
was a last resort prompted by the
conditions in which he was forced to
live. He explained that imprisoned
IRA members initially refused to be

a’ internment because she was pres-
sured by her European allies who. he
said, felt guilt by association because
Britain was still employing intern-
ment without trial in the latter part
of the twentieth century. McClorey
'said that Britain then devised ajudi—
cial system that consisted of one
judge (a British appointee.) nojury.
and operated similar to the French
system where a person is considered
guilty until proven innocent.

Under this system, the period of
detention without a lawyer is often
stretched to a week" or more, so that
“statements can be booted out of
people.” then alleged to have been
made voluntarily, according to
McClorey. g,

This type ofjudicial system was in

r

their cells. The guards promptly
threw the pots back in, McClorey
said, adding that when the prisoners
began to throw their chamber pots
out the window, the guards used
high—pressurc hoses on them.

“Some people believe he (Sands) committed sui-
cide. But ifyou relieve a man of his dignity and
many other things, you leave him no other

avenue ofprotest. ”

treated as criminals, claiming the
right not to wear prison clothes, to
mix freely with other prisoners. to
have mail privileges. and to have a
chance for a reduced sentence. But,’
they were still permitted to leave

Gradually, McClorey explained,
‘the prisoners would stay in their
cells, wear blankets instead ofprison
clothes, anmd smear their excre-
ment on the ‘walls rather than let it
build up on the floor. Occasionally

"said. “There is simply no way we can
accept a new status’ of political

prisoner’. It doesn’t" matter why they“

did what they did, the fact is they still
did it.” V —

“These are the conditio_ns_Bob1b’y

Sands had been living in since l976,”
McClorey said. “Some people
believe he committed suicide. But if
you relieve a man of his dignity and
many other things, you leave him no
other avenue of protest."

McClorey said that Sands’ elec-
tion to a seat in Parliament was an
indication of public recognition of
his right to be treated as a political
prisoner. He said that "‘if Britain
could acknowledge this, “she would
diffuse a potential time bomb.”

“Criminals are not inclined to
embark on lengthy hunger strikes to
their death,” McClorey said. He said
that Sands’ death demonstrated an
existence of'deeply felt ideals and
accomplished the feat of focusing
the world media on the Irish issue,
“but that’s a hell ofa price to pay.”

Each time a hunger striker dies,
there are other IRA members who
will volunteer to take his place,
according to McClorey. ‘

' “ls Maggie Thatcher prepared to
let " them all die because they are
criminals and a crime is acrime is a
crime?" asked McClorey.

Britain’s inﬂexibility on this posi-
tion is a roadblockito, achieving a
settlement, according to M‘cClorey..
But he added that any solution will
only come about with the suspen-
sion of alltypes of violence. - -

,

He said hisdisagreement with the

provisional wing of the _IRA "is.

caused by what he sees as an attitude
of “empty militarism,” which
ignores the bigger issue of removing
the British army from Northern Ire-

i land. McClorey said the commercial:
‘ bombing campaign undertaken by

the lRA’resulted in the bombing of
-‘any potential investment or" finan-"
cial support Ireland could hope_to
gain. Heisaid the 7campaign hurt
tourism, a major industry in
land " I _
The IRA leadership is also..tiegin-
ning to bow to rank andfile pressure

iIre- -~

orthern Ireland  

to engage in sectarian conflict with
the Protestant paramilitary organi-
zations, McClorey said. " "

“As soon as you begin to retaliate,
you create a never-ending cycle of
violence,” he said.

McClorey said the first step in
attempting a settlement is the remo- ’ "
val of British troops from Northern . f‘-
lreland. The United States, he said,
could play a role in settling the con-'
flict by pressuring Britain to recog- _
nize it has a “grave responsibili_ty”to ", i

resolve the issue of political status __i-
for IRA prisoners. ‘ ”

McClorey added that he is aware
there are a" number of groups in the. 1
United States who favor a military 
solution by the IRA, but he said this
isia “useless" position because “the
last thing Ireland needs‘ is‘mo_re ‘i_-J:
guns.”

“As «soon as you-begin 
to retaliate, you create 1.‘
a never ending circle of 
fear.”  ; 

The Catholic hierarchy in Ir_.e'land"‘""  ‘
should display more leadership- 
instead ofjust condemning the vi6- ""1 _.
lence, according to McClorey. I"-"I‘e.g
also said that leaders from Southern 
Ireland are finally beginning to real-
ize theirresponsibility by entering.
into negotiations with British Prime"
Minis_ter Margaret Thatc"h"er_.j ~ "

Buta complete solution can never
be realized, McClorey said, if Bri-_
‘A tain continues to maintain a position I
of inflexibility. ‘ _. i
McClorey said Britain‘ ""canrio"t"
ignore what the says are legitimat"ee.-

Abolishing Protestant ‘rule,

endorsed by the British Labour";

Party as a solution to the conflict in
Northern; Ireland, according to
Labor Party member -Gordon
Shaeffer, a member of an "interna-
tional peace delegatiori that held a
conference at Pitt May" 13.

__ But_, Shaeffer added; attempts to
implement such a solution at this
point wouldresult in civil war. "

He explained that British Prime

Radecic Named
All-A merica;

Murray Scratches
By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Pitt News Sports Editor-

Indiana, Pa.-As the temperature
dipped into the -low-50’s Friday
afternoon and a light drizzle con-
tinued to fall from the grey, overcast
skies, the AIAW Division II
National track and field champion-
ships sloshed along as scheduled at
Indiana University of Pennsylvania.
Amid alot of unconcealed disap-
pointment about the weather, Pitt‘s
Peri Radecic beamed.

“Let it rain. This is great!”
Radecic said gleefully as she sat and
watched the second and final ﬂight
of the discus trials get underway. “I
loverit when it’s like this. The circle
gets wet and a lot of these girls can’t
take it. They worry too much about
the weather and forget about throw-
ing.” Radecic pulled her sweatsuit
hood on and smiled some more.

Radecic, who finished second in
her flight, qualified for the finals and
went on in the drizzle to wing her
second-best throw ever in the discus,
44.24 meters (l45’-2) to take third-
place in the nation behind Pat
Washington of Southeast Missouri
(45.50m) and Jane Sumner of
Southern Illinois-Evansville
(45.l4m). The third-place showing
also won Radecic “All-American
honors, which go to the top six fin-
ishers in each event.

“It‘s a credit to Peri that she fin-
ished so well because, basically, she
did most of her formal training on
her own," head coach Alfreeda Goff
explained. “We don‘t have a field
events coach. It's not fair to Peri, but
she’s our only thrower and it’s not
financially feasible to have a coach
for just one person.“

Radecic‘s showing was probably
the lone bright spot for Pitt in a
weekend dampened by some unex-
pected disappointments.

First, Pitt’s other entrant, sprinter
Gwen Murray, tried out her pulled
left hamstring in the 200-meter dash
trials Thursday. Neither she nor
Goff were pleased. Murray, seeded

sixth going into the event, finished
last in her heat. ,

“I couldn’t really put any weight
on the leg, and after I took last in the

I trial, we both thought it was wise

that I scratch both events," Murray
said, referrring to the 200 and 400-

meter dash, where she was seeded ,
first going into the meet with a time ,

of 53.6.

To say that Murray had the field
outclassed) at 400-meters would be
an understatement. Laura Wright of
Rice University eventually won the
event with a ballooning 55.01.

Even though the weather seemed
to be in Radecic's favor, some other

factors weren't. Radecic, this year’s '

Eastern champion in both the discus
and the shotput, was not permitted
to compete in the shotput beacausei
of a “technicality,” according to
Goff. . '

“They ruled Peri ineligible to
compete in the shot because her
name was inadvertently omitted
from the flight sheets, and we (Pitt)
didn’t have anyone at the pre-meet

meeting to catch the mistake," said

Goff, who had to work the night of
the meeting. “I asked them to recon-

Sheer photo

sider, but they ruled she couldn't
compete.”

Again it would seem that Pitt got
shortchanged. Radecic has thrown
over 45.feet.this year, a distance that
would have placed her in the top
four at this Nationals. Jeri Daniels
of William‘ and Mary took fourth
with a put of 44’-6%. Sharon Hamil-
ton of Cal State-Bakersfield won the
event with'a 49-6‘/2. I

Both athletes were philosophical
about the mishaps.

.eWCII, _I just look at it as one of it

those things that happen,” said Mur-
ray, who has been sidelined fre-
quently before with similar-
hamstring problems. “I’m hoping to
be back for the AAU Nationals June
I9-2l, and _I‘m going to run this
summer forthe New Image Track
Club.” _

The injury "brought a premature
end to Murray’s senior season and‘
Pitt career, a career marked by an
array of outstanding achievements
that include five individual,Pitt out-.
door sprint records and a share of
three more record-setting times as a

member of [I1 400-, I600-, and 800-“.

INDIANA, PA.-—Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo depended
on team depth and a record-setting performance by two-
time Olympian Karin Smith to romp to the team title in the
l98l Division II AIAW National track and field champion-
ships at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Thursday
through Sunday. ‘

Cal Poly-SLO racked up 69 points— to easi‘y outdistance
South'Carolina State in second with 5l points. The Univer-
sity of Idaho took third with 50 points, mainly on the
strength of a hat trick by Australian Patsy Sharples in the
distance events.

Smith’s throw of62.2 meters (translated: 204-1 ‘/2 ft.) easily
won first place in the javelin and was the only record set
during the three-day competition marred slightly by the
chilly, rainy weather. Smith’s nearest competitor, Darlene
Ourso of Sam Houston State, took second at 45.3_7 meters.

~ Smith, who has hit 209 feet this year, is_only the second
American woman ‘ever F0 top the 200-foot mark. She
returned to collegiate competition this year after spending
last year in West Germany to concentrate on training full-
time. ' V L »

Though deceptively small, compared to some other
throwers, Smith generates most of her power from her legs,
which show the results of her extensive weight-training
regime. .

“Some__of the guys said she was down in the weight room

squatting 250 pounds,” said Randy Yelenko, a student at’

Indiana. “They said she was bench-pressing over I80."

Besides Smith, several other individual performances
highlighted the meet.

Sharples, ldaho‘s lanky distance star, swept the 3000-,
5000- and I0,000-meter runs to account for 30 of her teams
50 points. By the time she was wrapping up her third first.
place, in the 3000'-met'er run, the "sight of Sharples sprinting
down the final I00-meters ofthe homestretch and frequently

' glancing over her shoulders at her opponents had become

almost expected. Only the 3000 wa‘s a close race,as Sharples
nipped Nancy Gieske of South Dakota State, 9:44.ll to
9:44.52. Gieske also finished second to Sharples in the 5000-
meter run, whigi Sharples took in l6:3l.3 to Geiske’s
l6:34.I. ~

Farleigh Dickinson freshman Candy_Young, a native of
Beaver Falls, took first in the I00-meter hurdles at I3.43,
trailed by Delores Gibb- of Long Island University (l3.84)
and Alesia Sweeny of Cal State-Northridge (13.87). ~

South Carolina State’s Elizabeth Greathouse kept busy
over the weekend earning All-America honors in a meet-
high four events. Greathouse was a member of the winning

. I600-meter relay team and grabbed two seconds in the 400-

meter relay and 200-meter dash. She-also went on to finish
fourth in the I00-meter dash in ll.9l. Constance Ward of
Cal State-Bakersﬁeld won the L00 in ll.73. Phyllis Blunt-

' son, also of Cal State-Bakersfiegl andthe fifth-best Ameri-

can woman high-jumper ever, won the high jump at 6-0,
followed by Sue McNeal of Cal Poly-SIO (5.9%) and Peg.
Stewart of Villanova (5-7). ,

Jackie May-Durham of Angelo State woi1the200-meter‘
dash in 23.75, followed by_Greathouse at 23.95 and Sonia
Clark of South Carolina.State at 24.1 I. Pitt's Gwen Murray,
who was forced to scratch from the event, had qualified with
a 24.7 clocking. 2

Seattle Pacific’s Kathy Wilson sparkled in .the hepta-
thlon to take first.with 5 I55 points. Wilson took first place in
in three of the seven events—the javelin, Iongjumpiandshot

which finished with a 2|-ll
record and was returning four
starters, was forced to adjust to a
new coach and three transfer
players from Edinboro.

They adjusted to the best
season ever (22-8) and broke
eight team records. “Never in my
wildest dreams did I think we
would accomplish that,” said
Saurer.

Welsh wasn’t satisfied with the
adjustment. “I think there were
four games we should have won
that we lost, the two games with
Villanova, Cheyney State and
definitely Syracuse."

Welsh didn't‘ like the way
players were constantly shifted in

and out of the game. “She didn’t

give people enough time to jell
when they were in the game,"
Welsh said.

Koziol, a 5'8” guard from
Willow Grove, Pa., said, “The
offense was geared to certain
people,” and that when things
weren’t going right, “she (Saurer)
would blame one person.”

‘Welsh said Saurer took the
“I’m the head coach attitude”
and, wouldn’t listen to
complaints.

Saurer was surprised to hear
that as many as nine players from
last year’s team night not return
but said she was aware of the
three women transferring.

“They feel they can make a
bigger contribution somewhere
else,” said the coach.

Saurer’s late arrival at Pitt

dldn‘t give her a chance to do any
recruiting last year. The ,only
familiar faces to the coach were
the three transfers from
Edinboro and she didn’t have
very long to get acquainted with
the other twelve players she
inherited from Balthaser.

“Each kid is different...sorﬁe
yell, some cry and some are very
private. To get to know everyone
in one year is an exercise-and-a-
half,"’said Saurer.

Thecoach said that Maryalyce
Jeremiah, a coach in her first
year at Indiana University, was
faced with the same type of
problem. She lost four players in
the thick ofthe season, according
to Saurer. “I’m thankful that
didn’t happen to“us,” Saurer
said.

In defense of her coaching
strategies and styles Saurer said,
‘‘I’m very demanding. l’ll tell you
if I don’t like,something. If a
player takes a bad shot l’ll ask
why she took that shot.”

The coach said that a lot of
people don’t like Bobby Knight’s
coaching methods. Knight, you
might say, is the Woody Hayes of

 

counts. I’m sure things will work

college basketball but’ instead of
taking out his frustrations on
cameramen and opposing
football players, " Knight has,
among other things, picked on
police officers in Puerto Rico.
But, he is a winner, leading the
Indiana Hoosiers to two NCAA
championships and six Big [0
titles.

Saurer said she now
understands what the women on
the team had to go through. “It’s
difficult to change their habits.
It‘s like teaching them to brush
their teeth all over again, but we
have to compromise.”

“We women have a lot of
growing to do,” said Saurer. “lt‘s
what happens in the end that

out for the better.”

With all her recruiting duties
Saurer didn’t have much time to
talk with her players but she said,
“I think we’ll have people on this
team back, Pam (Miklasevich)
will be back...I hope.”

Jackie Sherrill’s new series of five one—year contracts may
not be enough to keep him in Pittsburgh should Alabama

Jackie Sherrill, whose win/loss
record at Pitt is the best in the
school is long and illustrious football
history, has been rewarded with a

new, long-term contract.

-Sherrill and the university have

signed a rolling, five-year contract
that both parties agree signifies
Pitt's continuing committment to a
quality, winning football program.
‘ “ We ‘re «very happy that Jackie has
signed to be our football coach for
an indefinite period in the future, ”
Pitt Athletic Director Cas M yslinski
said in making-the announcement.
“The new contract will give our,pro-
gram continued stability and conti-
nuity...  I - '

"—Press release,
Pitt Sports Information

Something doesn't seem right
about that press release- After read-
ing such aglowing report, you might’
be tempted to face the South and
shake your fist tauntingly at the Ala-
bamas and, Georgia Techs who
reportedly covet Pitt’s latest
miracle-w_orking coach since his pre-
decessor, good 01’ Johnny.

Johnny? Oh, y’all remember
Johnny Majors, the man who
hitched onto Tony Dorsett’s star
and molded the 1976 National
Championship team here at Pitt.

While you're basking in delight
over Sherrill’s signing, you could
even send thanks to the University of
Tennessee for the coach they gave us
when Johnny packed his bagsand
headed home to join his alma mater.
Things haven't been bad since then.
And who could blame Majors for
succumbing to the tug of the heart-
strings, although some said it was
the purse st_rings-too.

It could happen to Sherrill.

I Not to say that it will, butthe
thing wrong with this “long—term”
contract is__that,it’s» not really long-

" term at all. Maybe Myslinski was

accurate in saying Sherrill had

-— signed to be _our-football coach for

an “indefinite period of time". It
looks good for public relations pur-
poses for Pitt to -‘say Sherrill has
signed a five-year c,ontract, but what
it really seems to amount to is a se-
ries of five one-year contracts that
renews itself each year‘ by mutual

i_ agreement of both Sherrill and Pitt.

.Sio es_sen_tially,9‘~iS.hierrill will,be>in

So I o
Viewpoint
five years and seemingly free to leave
if he choses to or presumably even

renegotiate his contract after each .

season.

And Pitt, well, it can rely on its
side of the coin—they could termi-
nate the contract if dissatisfied with
Sherrill’s performance~—but then,
they always had that option. In that
case, although the exact contract
terms were not revealed», Pitt might
not have to buy out the remaining
years -on the contract‘ s‘h“di1l‘d"they
fire,Sherrill, since the contract, is
subject to yearly renewal. But unless

the bottom falls out of thefootball A

program, the possibility seems
remote.

Nobody was around yesterday

who could answer why five one—year

contracts were agreed on instead of a
five-year pact if continuity and sta-
bility were important. Sherrill_was
away in New York with his staff and
Athletic Director Cas Myslinski is
on vacation this week._

When asked if thegcontract left
open the possibility of Sherrill’s
departure, based on the series of
one-year deals, Assistant Athletic
Director Walt’ Cummins said, “I
guess you could look at it that way,”
and added, “I only know what
you’re reading in the papers.”

' Nobody? was around

. yesterday ' who  could

answer why" five ‘one-
year contracts were
agreed on instead of a
five-year pact if conti-
nuity andstability were

I important._

Suddenly, the image of a five-year
continuing committment pales

i somewhat. Thereiis no ‘hitch pre-

venting Sherrill from picking up and
riding the tide into Alabama or any-
where else. But especially Alabama.

Sherrill has’ long been typecast as
the heir apparent to the legendary
Paul “Bear” Bryant for several years
now, but it appears Bryant .won’t

step down until he overtakes Alonzo.
- Staff in the career victory column.

That could come this year, or at the
very latest next year, and the
...watch out.

Top Finishers

The handful of Pitt Panthers who ‘

competed at the Penn State Open
this past weekend picked up where
they left off at the Pitt Invitational
two weekends ago—with consistent
top ﬁnishers in most events they
entered.

The Pitt mile relay team of Darryl
Baynes, Greg Conover, Garland
—Brown and Mario Joyner repeated
its fourth-place finish but lowered its
time at Penn State over a second,
turning in a 3:l5.2 despite the cold
and windy conditions. Brown came
back to take fourth in the 800-meter

run with a l:53.4 to improve a notch '

on his fifth-place ﬁnish at the Pitt
Invitational, eventhough he ran two
seconds faster in the Pitt meet.

In the absense of Larry Kinney,

‘who has already qualiifieidi for

Nationals in the triple jump,
teammate Ralph Mitton has been
showing well. Mitton took fifth in
the event at Penn State with a leap
of 47-4, almost a foot better than his
jump at the Pitt meet.

A Pitt‘s Terry Gallagher, one of the
team’s best hopes in the 800-meter
run, was spiked during the race at
Penn State and did well to just
manage to finish, according to head
coach Mike Agostinella.

“He finished, but he almost had to
walk in, ” Agostinella said. “We had
expected him to do real well in the
race until he got spiked."

Gallagher was hoping to use the

‘meet to qualify for Nationals, but

the injury may now jeopardize his
chances. The Panthers have two
meets remaining, this weekend at the

IC4A’s at Villanova and in two
weeks at the Central Collegiates

meet at Michigan State, in which to
qualify.

“Gallagher may be able to qualify,
but it depends on how the raceiand

more that that. I‘m really happy iv

“It's not-a strange situation for me

noted. “I don‘t expect any problems '

Pitt Baseball update...

Apparently the l98l season is
overgfor the Pitt‘ baseball team;
which did not receive the post-
season hid it had‘ hoped for after
completing its best season ever at
25-8. ‘ .
 The team/and coach Bobby Lewis
had hoped to recieve a NCAA East-
ern Regional bid, but when the list of
teams was announced Pitt was not

' included.

In the East, conference winners
Temple (27-l I), Maine (27-I I), St.

A Johnis (31-2) and Yale (24-11) are

among the teams who extended their
seasons. At-large bids were also,
extended to Miami (52-8), Gonzaga
(48-19), San Diego St. (51-I5), and
Stanford (40-20), to name a few.
More‘ favorable weather and ‘travel
considerations enable many teams

 

to play a more extensive schedule .

that Pitt does.
Before the bids were sent out,

Lewis was hoping the team’s statis- ’

tics would win it a bid, since many
members of the selection committee

had not seen Pitt play. But, he -
added, “there are so many teams, ~

some good ones are bound to get left

' out. There’sjust so many bids, and I
A’ can sympathizewith.‘ the selection
7 committee. They have a:~ difficult

job.”_ ‘ ' »
