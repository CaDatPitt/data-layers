The Board of Trustees has hired re-
inforcements to aid in its national
chancellor search. ,

According to a release to the
University community from Board
Chairman Stephen R. Tritch, Pitt has
contracted Storbeck Pimentel &Asso—
ciates, an executive ﬁrm that special-
izes in employee searches for colleges
and universities. Carnegie Mellon
University recently employed the
ﬁrm during its presidential search.

In June, Chancellor Mark Nor-
denberg announced his plans to step
down from his current position in
August 2014. ‘The Board has since
appointed its vice chairwoman, Eva
Blum, as chair of the Search Com—
mittee, and Provost Emeritusjames
Maher will act as vice chair of the
committee. "

Tritch said that “while the ulti-
mate responsibility lies with the
Board of Trustees,” Storbeck Pimen-
tel’s workwill lay a foundation for the
Search Committee members to “get
to work immediately” once selected.
Elections to ﬁll the committee’s fac-
ulty positions are scheduled to take
place in the coming weeks.

The ﬁrm has conducted more than
1,800 executive—level searches for
higher education institutions over the
last 20 years, according to the release.

University aligns  Worker  Consortium

Gideon Bradshaw
News Editor

After almost a year, some student
activists found out Monday that they
got what they wanted.

The activists tried to persuade Pitt
to make a formal agreement they said
would provide extra assurance that
the University’s apparel was made
under fairconditions. S

The Worker Rights Consortium, S b

an organization that monitors labor
conditions at factories that provide
licensed apparel for universities and
high schools, received a letter Friday
from Pitt. In the letter, Pitt formally
agreed to join with the WRC.

Although Pitt was already using
the services of the Fair Labor Asso-

ciation, another group that moni— ‘

tors labor conditions infacilities that
produce its licensed apparel, some
students argued that afﬁliatingwith
the WRC as well as the FLA would bet-
ter protect the welfare of the wo rkers

V who make Pitt’s apparel.

Seniorjoe Thomas, the co—found—
er and former president of Ameri-
cans for Informed Democracy on
Pitt’s campus, said he was thrilled
that Pitt chose to affiliate with the
WRC. He and administrators plan
to meet Wednesday.

Pitt’s decision came as a surprise
to Thomas, who learned about it»sec-

ondhand.

Administrators reached out to
him and others connected with No
Sweat last week to set up a time when
they could all meet. ‘

But Pitt had not told him that it
was joining the WRC.

He found out Monday night
when a friend in the national activ-
ist group United Students Against
Sweatshops told Thomas that she
saw Pitt’s name listed on the WRC’s
website as an aﬁiliate. After Thomas’
friend conﬁrmed through an email
with a WRC representative that Pitt
had afﬁliated, she forwarded‘ him the
message, which said that Pitt had,
indeed, joined.

“I think I jumped,” he said.
Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said

\ that Pitt wanted to meet with Thomas

and others from No Sweat in order to
tell them face to face. This particular
meeting is currently scheduled for
Wednesday evening.

Even after stepping down as
president of AID, Thomas served as
an adviser in the group and headed
its efforts as part of No Sweat, a coali-
tion that advocated affiliation with
the WRC. Since the beginning of the
2012 fall semester, Thomas and oth-
ers involved with the coalition had
tried to persuade Pitt to join the WRC

STUDENT EovERNMENT

Board convenes for first m

Brett Wilson
Staff Wrz'ter

After 'I‘uesday’s Student Govern-
ment Board meeting, Board mem-
bers, committee chairs and students‘
milled around Nordy’s Place in the
William Pitt Union to discuss in-
volvement. C

Freshman Michael Kister shared
his hopes of becoming a member
of the Fundraising subcommittee,
which falls under the Community
Outreach committee.

“I was really involved in student
government in high school, and it
seems like a great organization to
get involved with here at Pitt?’ Kis-

V ter said.

SGB president Gordon Louder-
back welcomed 70 new and retum—
ing students, who gathered during
the Board’s weekly public meeting
duringwhich members passed one
resolution unanimously.

Board member Mike Nites’ res-
olution, which dealt with Student
Affairs Afﬁliated Groups and the
previous budget codes that these
organizations abide by, was origi-
nally tabled in April.

SAAGs were previously required
to submit their budget request for

semesters before the end of the
previous spring semester. SAAGs
are large student groups that re-
ceive a predetermined portion of
the Student Activities Fund rather
than submitting weekly allocations
requests like traditional student
groups. V

The Resident Student Asso-
ciation, Interfraternity Council,
National Panhellenic Conference,

   
   

Panhellenic Association, Black Ac-
tion Society, Asian StudentAlliance,
Engineering Student Cabinet and
Nursing Student Association all
qualify as SAAGs.

The new resolution will now al-
low SAAGS to submit their budget
requests semester by semester.
They will still make their fall semes-
ter requests in the spring, but spring
budget requests will now occur in

the preceding fall semester.

mittee chair also reported on ini-
tiative progress made over the
summer.

time when 13 other universities,
including the University of Michi-
gan and Ohio State, are searching
for new leaders.

The Board has also authorized
the development of a website de-
voted to disseminating information
to prospective candidates related to
the search, the University and the
position. Development is currently
underway, according to Tritch.

The Board plans to host open
forums in late September or early
October on campus, as well as on
regional campuses, to provide fac-
ulty, staff and students with the op-
portunity to voice their input on
the search.

While open forums will be con-
ducted during the initial phase of
the process, Tritch said that much
of the ﬁnal stages of the search will
occur in private to protect the con-
ﬁdentiality of the candidates.

“There may_ be periods of
seeming inactivity in the months
ahead, but you have my assurance
that bringing the search for a new
chancellor to a deliberate, swift and
successﬁil conclusionwillbe the No.

he said. I

Employmentfair to provide job opportunities to students

Kathleen Fennell
Staff Wrz'ter

After attending most of their classes and
weighing their course loads for the semester,
some students mightlook at their empty wal-
lets and decide they need to begin searching
for a part—time job.

job -hungry students can stop by the Wil-
liam Pitt Union on Thursday between noon
and 3 p.m. to talkto more than 50 employers
at the Student Employment Fair.

Cheryl Finlay, director of the University
of Pittsburgh Office of Career Development
and Placement Assistance, said in an email
that the fair is designed for those who want
to ﬁnd positions that do not require a col-
lege degree. ‘

“Students who are looking for part—time
employment or internships can meet with
representatives from many Pitt departments
as well as local employers,” Finlay said.

Last year the event drew about 800 stu-
dents, and Finlay said that a similar turnout
is expected this year.

The Student Employment Fair is not to be
conﬁised with the Fall Career Fair, which is
scheduled for late next month. While the em-
ployment fair helps students ﬁnd part—time

’ work, the career fair is designed for students

seeking jobs in their ﬁelds after graduating.

“The Fall Career Fairwill have recruiters
and representatives from more than 200
local, regional and national nonproﬁts, cor-

, porations, government agencies and gradu-

ate schools. Most of the positions that these
representatives are looking to ﬁll will be
ﬁill-time, requiring a bachelor’s or master’s
degree,” Finlay said.

Students can ﬁll out applications during
the fair and meet with representatives from

employers within the University, including i F

the offices of Student Life, Intramurals and

Recreation, Cross Cultural and Leadership T,

Development and the William Pitt Union.

 “For students who are lookingforawork— '
stuglyposition, part—time job or internship, T

this will save them a lot of time and effort,”
‘Finlay said.

According to the website for Pitt’s Of-
ﬁce of Admission and Financial Aid, stu-
dents who qualify for work study receive it
as part of their ﬁnancial aid package. The
federal government subsidizes funds that
count toward work—study students’ salaries.

‘  department or agency that employs the p

students pays the rest. _ .

Shawn Ahearn, the director of communi-
cation for Student Affairs, has hired students
through the Student Employment Fair in

previous years. He said that the event helps
him save time as an employer.

“From my perspective, it’s great because
I get to meet the people. You can meet 25
people in a matter of two hours, whereas, if I
just got 25 resumés  It’s just more cumber-
some,” Ahearn said. .

Ahearn also said that students who are
able to meet with prospective employers
have a better chanceof making a favorable
impression. He added that the fair can be
particularly beneﬁcial to freshmen.

‘7It’s just a good opportunity, especially

for the incoming freshmen  This is a place . s
where they can cruise through and visit a lot

of possible employers in a very nonthreaten—
ing, casual way  It’s_r1ota»real formal atmo-
sphere. It’s pretty laid back  It’s something
that is good for the younger students for
sure,” Ahearn said. “It’s just a great place for
employers to meet students and students to
meet employersf’,

Beth Plocki, the manager of human re—‘

sources for Sodexo Campus Solutions at
Pitt, said the fair gives employers a chance
to witness students’ customer service skills.

‘ “This gives us a chance to talk to students
and ﬁnd out what type of position they are
lookingfor and what kind of availability they
have,” Plocki said in an email.

Local restaurant owner

Natalie Daher
Assistant News Editor

Authorities are attempting to shut down a
South Oakland pizza shop after its owner
was arrested Tuesday for possession of
about half a kilo of cocaine, a pound of
marijuana and dozens of oxycontin pills.
According to the aﬂidavit listing the
charges against Fadi Aboud, 35, who owns
Larry and Carol’s Pizza Restaurant, the
pizza shop located at 410 Semple St. is
the scene of major alleged drug activity.
The indictment includes ﬁve counts of
using a communication device to set up a
cocaine transaction, 16 counts of possess-
ing cocaine with the intent to distribute,
one count of possessing marijuana with
the intent to distribute and one count of
possessing oxycontin with the intent to

distribute.

The charges also include 12 counts of
possession of cocaine, perkoset, oxycontin
and marijuana. Aboud is also charged with
two counts of possession of paraphernalia.

Mike Manko, a spokesman for the office
of Allegheny County District Attorney Da-
vid Zappala, said in an email that Zappala
is in the process of having the restaurant,
which is located less than a mile from Pitt’s
campus, declared a public nuisance and
shut down. . _

An unidentiﬁed party at Larry and Car-
ol’s Pizza Restaurant hung up the phone
when the restaurant was contacted mul-
tiple times Tuesday evening. S ‘

According to the district attorney’s af-
ﬁdavit, law enforcement officers began in-
tercepting Aboud’s phone communications
last February after an informant allegedly

charged

told a police officer that he or she had seen
cocaine in the back of the shop.

The arrest followed six months of inves-
tigation by the district attorney’s Narcotics
Enforcement Team, the Pennsylvania State
Police Bureau of Drug Law Enforcement
and oﬂicers from Wilkins Township, Swiss-
vale, North Versailles and McKees Rocks.

They arrested Aboud at his restaurant,
where they recovered substantial amounts
of cocaine and oxycontin.

Authorities later searched his home
in the lower Hill District, where they re-
covered additional cocaine, additional
oxycontin and perkoset. They also found
a large press allegedly designed “to pack-
age and sell cocaine.” ,

Aboud is currently awaiting arraign-
ment. I

Sodexo is seeking to hire 75 to 80 em-
ployees this semester for a variety of food
service positions across campus. Last year,
Sodexo hired more than 50 students who
attended the event.

“We love having student employees and
do our best to place as many applicants as
possible,” Plocki said.

Marilyn Ross, the director oflntramurals
and Recreation, said that she is also seeking
about four student workers at the Student
Employment Fair this semester. She hopes
to ﬁnd people with a passion for sports.
“We’re always looking for enthusiastic
students  Work-study students we have
picked up have been dynamite,” Ross said.

by holding events to speak to students about
the issue and by meeting with administrators
to explain their position.

Unlike the FLA, whose affiliates include
retail corporations with a speciﬁc interest
in proﬁts, the WRC’s affiliates are exclusively
universities and high schools.

But the FLA disagrees that this hurts work-
ers’ rights.

Heeral Coleman, a senior spokeswoman
for the FLA, said in an email that the compa-
nies affiliated with the group must conduct
internal monitoring of the factories that make
their products.

Members of AID and other organizations
that advocated for affiliation with the WRC
said that the group takes certain measures
to monitor factories that make apparel and
other products.

For example, the WRC’s policy mandates
that assessors interview employees about la-
bor conditions outside of their place of work.
According to the WRC’s logic, this makes the
employees less vulnerable to coercion from
their bosses or the owners of the factories.

Such measures ensure that the assessors
get more honest answers, Thomas said.

While interviews with employees are also
among the measure the FLA uses to evaluate
conditions at facilities that make products for

its aﬂiliates, the assessors are allowed to use
their own discretion in where they conduct
the interviews.

Coleman said that the services of the FLA
and WRC complement each other, and it is
not uncommon for schools to affiliate with
both.

The FLA did not reply to an email asking
Coleman to elaborate on how the organiza-
tions complement one another.

Throughout the last academic year,
Thomas and others from No Sweat coalition,
which included more than 50 organizations,
met with Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey
ﬁve or six times. Vice Chancellor G. Reynolds
Clark was also at several of these meetings.
The coalition also held events in order to
present its position.

Last fall, Fedele told The Pitt News in an
email that the University was satisﬁed with
"the FLA’s services. In a March email, he said
that Pitt was listening to students’ concerns
about apparel oversight, but declined to com-

Fedele said that Pitt’s administration
decided to join the WRC after learning that
many universities are affiliated with both
organizations. It is unclear when exactly Pitt
decided to join the WRC.

‘ “We decided there would be value to
the University to have a membership in the
Worker Rights Consortium, and that would
augment our membership with the Fair Labor
Association,” he said. V

conditions.” .

In order to affiliate with the WRC, each
year a university must pay 1 percent of the
gross licensing revenue, which includes all
the official apparel bearing the university’s
logo. This amount is calculated based on the
previous year.

Colemanlsaid that schools affiliated with
the FLA pay the same annual rate of 1 per-

cent of gross licensing revenue, with the fee

capped at $50,000 per year.

Thomas said that administrators reached
out to members of his group Friday. As of
press time, a meeting is scheduled to take

perspectives, even if they didn’t always agree.

PRISM oversteps boundaries,
posing dark future for Americans

Tiemoko Ballo
Columnist

This summer the world found
out about the Planning Tool for
Resource Integration, Synchro-
nization and Management, or
PRISM. This contrived acronym
is the once—secret codename
for an ominous and pervasive
surveillance and data-mining
program run by the National
Security Agency.

PRISM allows the NSA and
the FBI to directly access the
central servers of nine major
U.S. internet ﬁrms — including
Google, Microsoft, Facebook
and Apple — in order to con-
stantly monitor audio, video,
photos, emails, documents and
connection logs.

The program began in 2007,
followingépassage of the Bush
administration’s USA Patriot
America Act, but it remained
top secret until NSA contrac-

tor Edward Snowden leaked
classiﬁed information to The
Guardian in June 2013.

PRISM’s existence means
that our government has the
potential to constantly moni-
tor each of us and that the
world’s largest tech companies
— whose services we depend
on — are actively feeding gov-
ernment agencies any and all
customer information.

Even the most conservative
interpretation of the Fourth
Amendment would prove
PRISM unconstitutional.

Snowden’s leak justifies
many government conspiracy
theories and validates reasons
for anti-establishment para-
noia. Yet, despite the amount
of national coverage the PRISM
story received and the sheer
scale of what PRISM does, life
seems to have gone on large-
ly unchanged. Most people

don’t even seem bothered by
the threat of constant surveil-
lance. So the question arises:
How worried should you really
be? The answer is very —— you
should be terriﬁed.
Proponents of PRISM have
attempted to keep hysteria in
check by outlining the pro-
gram’s supposed limitations.
The day after PRISM’s exis-
tence became public, Presi-
dent Barack Obama defended
the program by saying that it
“does not apply to U.S. citizens,
and it does not apply to people
living in the United States.”
This claim was later defended
byjames Clapper, the director
of national intelligence.
Edward Snowden Unfortu-
nately the distinction between
citizen and foreigner is not as
cut-and-dry as it sounds. Ac-

cording to Barton Gellman ofThe Wash-
ington Post, analysts “key in ‘selectors,’
or search terms, that are designed to
produce at least 51—percent conﬁdence
in a target’s ‘foreignness.’” Once data
is collected, it is then evaluated to de-
termine if the data’s author is indeed
“foreign.” These targets are branded
without even a convincing degree of
conﬁdence. “That is not a very strin-
gent test,”p noted Gellman.

This creates two serious problems.
First, false positives will occur. Many
U.S. citizens will be mistakenly identi-
ﬁed as foreigners and tracked by PRISM
-— the 51 percent threshold is not rigor-
ous. Secondly, this creates an oppor-
tunity for the “plain view doctrine.”
Established in Horton v. California,
plain View essentially indicates that

' if law enforcement conducts a lawful

investigation and inadvertently dis-
covers evidence of a separate crime in

. many questions   

plain view, that evidence is incrimi-
nating and usable in court. This could
mean that if reason to persecute a U.S.
citizen appears while monitoring a
foreign suspect,

of us don’t have anything to hide and

will never do or say anything that will

even remotely interest the government. .A

But, that doesn’t mean our lives should
be open books.

the citizen could
be incriminated.
PRISM’s suppos-
edly foreign—on-
ly scope doesn’t:
hold up because »
the pro gram
could still easily
apply to U.S.. citi-
zens. Moreover, “

 l-low worried should,
you really be? The I
answer is very -5- you

‘rsphouldi be terrified.

Under PRISM,
massive amounts
of information you
expect to be private
— let’s say your
Amazon.com pur-
chase history —_is
put under scrutiny
if there’s “probable
cause.” That kind

, ofanalysis can4"cre—

about what data
and how much of

— it PRISM collects remain unanswered.

, But why should you care if you “have
nothing to hide?” The problem with
innocent people assuming surveillance
won’t affect them is one of misdirec-
tion. It’s a red herring that places focus
on an individual’s actions instead of a
widespread societal problem: loss of
privacy and data ownership. Yes, most

ate staggering and _
. disturbing conclu-
sions. A private company can already
determine if a woman is pregnant based
on purchase history alone. What could
someone put together with recordings
of your Skype ‘calls and all your Face-
book data? I

Even if big data analysis never re-
veals anything noteworthy about you,

you’d never know one way or the other.

There is no mechanism for citizens to
find out what data has been accessed
or collected because PRISM operates
in secrecy and without transparency.
This is where conspiracy theories start
to sound probable. It’s hard to imagine
that virtually unchecked secret surveil-
lance will never be abused.

So if you’re still nonchalant about
PRISM, ask yourself this: Whatwould
it take to shake you out of your indiffer-
ent stupor? Is a series ofserious abuses
necessary for you to decide that the
United States has traded away too much
civil liberty? How do you know those
abuses aren’t already occurring? P

These are difficult questions _to'an,— '

swer because PRISM creates a horren-
dous inequity ofinformation: You know
nothing about what the government is
doing, and it knows everything about
what you’re doing. This PRISM isn?t

transparent — it captures light and
‘keeps you in the dark!

Miller faces former team as Pitt battles Ohio State

Tyler Pecyna
Assistcmt Sports Editor

When the Pitt women’s soc-
cer team travels to Columbus
to face No. 23 Ohio State on
Wednesday, it will be a brief
homecoming for head coach
Greg Miller. '
Miller spent 11 seasons with
Ohio State’s women’s soccer

program, where he rose to the -

associate head coach position.
Such a role was specialized to
focus on defense and fresh—
man recruiting, the two facets
of college soccer that have the
Panthers (1-0) eyeing an upset
over the Buckeyes (2-0).

For proof, just look at Pitt’s
first game ofthe season: a 1-0
triumph over Duquesne. The
victory featured a shutdown
defense, led by junior goalie
Nicole D’Agostino, and sub-
stantial minutes logged by
eight freshmen.

Wednesday’s contest is the
first of three matches sched-
uled in ﬁve days, and it is also
the first test in what should
prove to be an arduous season
in the ACC. For a team that is
heavily depending on freshman
players to perform, tired legs
and mental lapses could hinder
the Panthers.

The burst of games is very

likely a challenge to players not
yet used to the grind of col-
lege soccer,- but junior defender
Jackie Poucel sees the youth
differently, in a more positive
light.

“I think we’re going to ex-
pect to be a little tired, to have
our legs be a little sore, but
with the amount of freshmen
andfresh legs we have to come
on the field, I think we’re going
to be OK,” Poucel said.

Poucel was a part of the de-
fensive line that held Duquesne
scoreless for 90 minutes Sun-
day, though such an effort is
something Miller is used to
witnessing.

In his tenure with the Buck-
eyes, Miller oversaw defenses
that allowed the four fewest
goal totals in a season in school
history. He also coached Cassie
Dickerson, the 2010 Big Ten
Defensive Player of the Year,
five All—Americans and four
freshman All-American hon-
orees.

“[Our schedule presents] a
short turnaround to get ready
for a very good Ohio State
team,” Miller said. “Ohio State
is a team I know very well, hav-
ingrecruited many of those
kids. They are a good side and

Pitt must

trenches

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt head coach Paul Chryst generally
isn’t one to delve into the speciﬁcs
of events down the road, but in his
media address Monday, he identi-
ﬁed one early key to ﬁnding success
against No. 11 Florida State on Sept.
2: controllingthe line of scrimmage.

“That will certainly play a big
role,” Chryst said. “Line playin gen-
eral will be signiﬁcant.”

On Pitt’s end, the defensive line
looks like an early strength for the
Panthers.

Tyrone Ezell and Aaron Donald
return as starters from last year’s
team, havingracked up atotal of 103
tackles, 25.5 tackles for loss and nine
sacks as the ﬁrst teamers at the de-
fensive tackles position. Flankingthe
two will be a combination of David
Durham, Bryan Murphy and Ejuan
Price, who is listed as a starter on
Pitt’s depth chart at each end slot
with Durham and Murphy.

“We count the defensive line
as one of the strengths of our pro-
gram, and Florida State certainly has
a great offensive line,” Chryst said.
“In most football games, whoever
controls the line of scrimmage is the
team that has the advantage.”

It’s a challenge at the forefront
of the litany of ones facing the Pan-
thers in their ACC debut. But if the
Panthers can respond to the chal-
lenge and overcome it, Pitt’s d-line
play might very well help knock out
a number of other challenges.

That starts with pressure.

Astros should not be criticized for massive proﬁt in poor season

Tyler Pecyna
/Issistanzf Sports Editor

In news that should shock absolutely no
one, there is another ethical dilemma
in Major League Baseball.

Steroids and biogenesis take a back-
seat for the moment, as Forbes report-
ed earlier this week that the Houston
Astros will make about $99 million in
operating income on the season —— a
ﬁgure greater than that of the past six
World Series winners combined.

The author of the Forbes story, Dan
Alexander, explains that operating in-
come is “the earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization.”

Of course, there is nothing wrong
with a baseball team making tons of
money, which is why people still pay to
see games while wearing team apparel.

The Astros have the lowest payroll
in the league atjust more than $21 mil-
lion —— a ﬁgure about $14 million below
the next closest team — and own a pu-
trid 44-86 record. These shortcomings
are the source of consternation. This
likely would not be a story if it were
the Dodgers hauling in almost $100

= V million, though, because they have a

2013 payroll upwards of $220 million.

The majority of Houston’s revenue
comes from an $80 million TV deal with
Comcast SportsNet Houston to broad-
cast the games.

The Astros have released a statement
denying the numbers Forbes reported,
saying the story was “signiﬁcantly in-
accurate” regarding “the Astros’ rev-

e 5 ms were Ill‘ 0 e aw u

enues, the Astros’ media rights fee from
CSN Houston and CSN Houston’s per-
subscriber rate.” '
Even after the popularity of “Mon-
eyball,” even after the Tampa Bay Rays’
run of success in the past ﬁve years and
even after the late-’90s, early—2000s
Marlins’ ﬁve~year plan that had them in
playoff contention, the baseball world
still does not understand that some-
times certain teams should rebuild.

is year. e

 

em rem -3 papery.

That certain team happens to be
Houston, and the time happens to be
now. ' ~ ,

Alexander writes in his article, “If
the Astros were to use their current
gains to pay for future players, $99 mil-
lion could make a huge difference. The
Astros could have taken on the con-
tracts of the entire startinglineup for
the National League All—Star team this
year for just $84 million.”

 
  

    

CT‘ -ampus

But $99 million buys no guaranteed
wins, and adding one marquee player
to ‘Houston’s roster would be like dis-
patching one ﬁreﬁghter to a ﬁve-alarm
blaze. The $84 million salary of the All-
Stars only accounts for this year, though
many of those players have expensive,
long-term deals.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL

In its last season, BCS
desenres appreciation

Drew Sharp
M CT Campus

The start of a new college football season
this week also symbolizes the end of one

o of the sport’s more polarizing forces.

The BCS begins its farewell tour.

If this were a retiring head coach mak-
ing the rounds for one ﬁnal season, he
would be showered with parting gifts like
a rocking chair or a personalized golf cart.
The BCS will get a personalized hearse,
GPS equipped with the fastest route to the
nearest cemetery. .

I’ll miss the BCS. I liked it. Always did.
It wasn’t a ﬂawless method for determin-
ing the most deserving candidates for the
national championship. But perfection was
never its intention.

The BCS succeeded. Since its incep-
tion in 1998, college football revenue and
popularity exploded. And it was all because
the BCS planted the seed that an inher-
ently regional sport could embrace the
concept of a single team standing alone
atop the mountain after the season’s ﬁnal
bowl game. V

The BCS lit the path that appreciatively
pushed college football beyond its self-
imposed borders of conference champi-
onships. . ' Z ‘

But that won’t stop its legions of crit-
ics from joyously counting down the days

‘ until it takes its last breath in Pasadena,

Calif., on the evening of Jan. 6, 2014 and
then spitting on its grave afterward. In
their minds, the BCS embodied corruption,
contempt and greed. It was a wicked cabal
of a few conference commissioners whose
only goal was monopolizing power and
proceeds while squeezing out the little guy
who requested only an occasional crumb.
A Yeah, maybe, but it made college foot-
ball more fun, didn’t it?
College football remains the only major
sport that thrives on conjecture. Debates
rage and tempers ﬂare over preseason polls

‘and recruiting~class rankings. There’s a

subjective tone to the sport that remains

its mostenduring charm. It’s why college

football fans are more passionate than '

their professional football counterparts.

Why must there always be a nice, tidy
solution in sports‘? There’s always room
for an argument in college football. The
BCS provided plenty of bickering.

And how is that a bad thing?

One of the BCS’s greatest accomplish-
ments was its clariﬁcation of college foot-
ball’s regional imbalance. Eons ago, when
it was all about the Big Ten and the Rose
Bowl, the SEC and the Sugar Bowl, and
the Big Eight and the Orange Bowl, every
conference contentedly existed in its own
little world. ~

But the BCS dramatically underscored
an already acknowledged national popula-
tion shift from the Midwest to the Sun Belt
over the previous 20 years. According to
a 2012 NFL study on the concentration of
homegrown draft picks in 2003-2012, nine

' of the top 10 NFL—player—producing states

were in the Sun Belt.
A The one exception was Ohio.

It’s not a coincidence that each of the 15
BCS champions was composed predomi-
nantly of players from those 10 states:
California, Texas, Florida, Georgia, Ohio,
Louisiana, Virginia, South Carolina, North
Carolina and Alabama.

One of the motivations for killing off
the BCS was to somehowcreate a more
equitable process through an actual play-
off. Perhaps the most annoying anti-BCS,
whine was that the system was unfairly
skewed toward the SEC. (I’m not sure if
you’ve heard this before, but the SEC has
taken the last seven BCS crowns and nine
of the 15.) - g -

Above all else, BCS succeeded in open-
ing our eyes to the reality that there is no
equality in college football at its highest
level. And no playoff conﬁguration of four,
eight or 16 teams will balance those scales.

Maybe, after 16 years, the BCS’s time

' has rightfully passed.'But it’s nonetheless

entitled to a proper eulogy. I

back uncomfortable,” Chryst said. “The key to
all football is to stop the run. If you can do a
good job of stopping the run, then it’s easier
to get pressure on the quarterbac ”

And quarterback refers to redshirt fresh-
manjameis Winston, the No. 1 overall recruit
in the class of 2012. While Winston has yet to
play in a college game, shutting down one,
if not both, of the dual-threat qua1terback’s
threats is a must for the Panthers.

Ahead of him, though, is the tandem of
Devonta Freeman and James Wilder. Free-
man ran 111 times for 660 yards and eight
touchdowns in2012, while Wilder carried the
football 110 times for 835 yards and 11 scores.

Stopping, or at least containing, the pair of
explosive junior tailbacks is the priority for a
Pitt defense that wants to use its overpower-
ing line to wreak havoc in the Florida State
backﬁeld, especially against a quarterback
making his ﬁrst career start.

But to do so, Pittwill need to make serious
adjustments as the game progresses to keep
pace with a Seminole offense that possesses

a dominant edge when it comes to the speed —

department.

C _‘‘You really can’t simulate size and speed,”
Chryst said. “Whenyou’re playingan opponent
with a lot of speed at different positions like
Florida State, the bestthing you can do is go
with your best players and then adjust.” ,

While the line is strong, the possibility re-
mains that the Panthers won’t hold an advan-
tage on the line of scrimmage as it matches up
against a massive offensive line with massive
experience. '

No lineman for the Seminoles weighs less
than 300 pounds, and the line consists of four

juniors at the tackle and guard slots with senior
Bryan Stork anchoring the center position.

At Heinz Field next Monday, penetrating
the FSU backﬁeld starts with Aaron Donald.
The 6-foot, 285-pound tackle is well on his

way to becoming just another lineman from A

Pitt to become one of his conference’s best,
and Donald earned ﬁrst—team All-Big East
honors in 2013.

While the upset chances of Pitt remain rela-
tively low, those odds will likely skyrocket if
Pitt can control the tides of battles waged at
the line of scrimmage.

“That’s the startingpoint,”Chryst said. “We
want to run the ball and protect the quarter-
back. We’ll see how our defensive line matches
up against their offensive line.” I

will be a good contest for us. It will help
prepare-us for what we’ll see when We
begin Atlantic Coast Conference play
in a few weeks.”

Pitt and Ohio State faced each other
this spring in an abbreviated 45-minute
scrimmage. The Buckeyes, who were
coming offa season in which they cap-
tured the Big Ten title and were ranked
23rd in the nation, beat the Panthers
2-0.

The success has not stopped since
that victory, as the Buckeyes have start-
ed their 2013 campaign undefeated. In

A the season opener, Ohio State notched

a 3-2 win over Morehead State when
freshman forward Lindsay Agnew
scored with just under six minutes re-
maining. Junior midﬁelder Ellyn Gru-
ber’s goal in overtime gave Ohio State
a 2-1 win over Eastern Michigan in its
second game of the year.

Agnew leads the Buckeyes with two
goal, and sophomore midﬁelder Roosa

Arvas, who scored the deciding goal
against Duquesne, is the only Panther
to score from their lone game.

Freshman Siobhan McDonough,
one of four first-year Panthers to start
against the Dukes, said the team is en-
gaging in light practices to prepare for
the upcoming stretch of games.

“We’re just going to do some light
walk—throughs,” McDonough said.
“We’re not trying to practice too much,
especially with all these games, just try-
ing to keep everyone rested so we can
be ready to play.”

Though Miller knows the hardships
the team might endure over the next ﬁve
days, he said facing Ohio State will, if
nothing else, provide an accurate pre-
view for the talentpresent in the ACC.

“[The match] further prepares us for
some of the things we would see down
the road in the ACC in terms of systems,
in terms of athletes and talent,” he said.
“We’re hoping that we can learn some
things and try some things out in that
environment that will pay dividends
for us as we get into conference play.” I

tros rebuilding‘? Shouldn’t we be above
thinking that dollars amount to wins?

Last offseason, the Marlins splurged
on free—agent-signings to increase their
payroll to about $95 million for 2012
+ close to the value Alexander says
would be critical to improving Houston.
That total bought the Marlins a .426
win percentage and a last-place finish
in the NL East.

The Marlins spent with little reserve
in hopes the fans would flock to a new,
taxpayer-funded stadium. Unfortu-
nately, their inability to win thwarted
their plan, and Miami shed almost $150
million in payroll after the 2012 season.

The Astros allocated their money
where rebuilding teams should, spend-
ing millions in areas such as the draft
and international free agency. They held
the first overall pick for the second-
straight season and selected Stanford
pitcher Mark Appel, whoisigned with
the team for $6.35 million. Appel was

regarded as one of the top three play-
ers in the draft pool, yet Houston got
him for less than the amount the Chi-
cago Cubs paid for the No. 2 pick, Kris
Bryant.

That scenario is telling: The Astros
are savvy, not cheap, and they know
that winning organizations can be built
at a relatively low cost when facets of
the game likeplayer development and
scouting are stressed.

Astros owner Jim Crane told ESPN
The Magazine in June 2013, “Once our
minor league system is filled in, we’ll
move up into the top five or 10 in pay-
roll.”

After inheriting a stash of prospects
bereft of any impact talent in 2011,
Houston general managerjeff Luhnow
and his staff have a top—10 farm sys-
tem, featuring future impact players
like Appel.

Maybe Houston can use this year’s
supposedly massive profits in a few
seasons after the system’s talent is re-
stocked. Something about the Astros’
rebuilding decisions tells me that has
been their plan all along. 3
