. Edward Cox Comes to Pittsburgh!

Cox .‘Rop Session'Evolves

Closed Doors

by SHARON SEXTON

Behind

Edward Cox held a press conference Monday at 12:30 behind the
doors of the David R. Kurtzman Room in the Student Union. The doors.
which were closed and guarded by University policemen, were affixed
with a flyer which read: “Ed Cox wants to rap with you." .

After an uncomfortable and extremely short rap session with ao- ‘

proximately- 50 students Cox was wisked off to the Kurtzman Room by

his dynamo advance man, Sam.

As Sam led the Presii:lent’s son-in-law into the press conference he
informed the students that the conference was for the press only and
that students would not be admitted. Sam intended for this to include
students of all shapes, sizes, and politics. It was only after consider-
able difficulty and a few sharp words that he finally admitted this Pitt
News reporter. When I was permitted to enter it was with the cau-
tion, “You are here to report what went on during the press confer-

ence, don’t ask any questions.”

Cox had by this time embarked on what looked like it would be a

very ordinary press conference.

In answer to a question posed by Patrick Emery of KDKA regard-
ing the recent Gallup Poll which showed McGovern ahead 60 to 40 per
cent in the youth vote, Mr. Cox replied that Nixon led McGovern 61 to
36 per cent in the poll of those voters under 30. He explained that at the
time of the Democratic convention Nixon only lead McGovern 41 to 40
per cent in the poll of the youth vote. “Since that time there has been
a tremendous shift as shown in these new statistics. This is a shift that
I expected. It was only a matter of time before the young people real-
ized that they had a President that they could trust. Nixon is doing a
good job, he is concentrating on thething that counts—peace—and the

 ‘young people are reacting to this."
When asked why he was here on campus Cox replied,l_ “To get the_

opinions of the students.”

At that moment the crowd of young people who had anticipated a
rap session with Cox who were locked on the other side of the door be-
gan to furiously pound on the door of the Kurtzman Room. Cox, mom-
entarily distracted by the noise, continued to answer questions.

“As the pounding, shouting; and the static of police walkie talkies
continued, Cox seemed unable to concentrate on the questions and on
two occasions lost his train of thought. ‘

At one point a studentpshouted, “Eddie, Eddie please let me in. My
notebook is in there and I’m late for class.” ‘ ‘

The questions continued and Cox explained that he planned to cam-

paign actively for his father-in-law up until the election. .“I also plan to

do a great deal of organizational work with young voters for the Presi- _

dent.”

Tricia Cox and Julie Eisenhower will also be doing the same sort

of campaigning for their father.

Cox Fields Questions
Amid Student Protest

by VIRGINIA COOK v

Although signs posted in Schenley Hall early yesterday morning
proclaimed"‘Ed Cox wants to rap with you,” President Nixon’s son-in- ,
law seemed a little out of his Harvard Law School element at an inform- '
al session in the Student Union lobby yesterday at noon. His sideburns ”
were more closely cropped than those of the Republican Party’s stan- 
dard bearer, his smile seemed more boyish, and dressed in a straight-
legged business suit, he contrasted sharply with the jeaned, book-carry- ',
ing students who pushed in closer to hear the exchange of questions and
answers at this impromptu “meeting.” I ~ c

Joe Huss. a senior majoring in Political Science, told Cox he would
like to register his disappointment at Nixon’s refusal to accept the ,
recommendations of the Shafer ‘Commission, a presidentially appoint- 
ed group that has favored the legalization of marijuana.

Cox,_who, in Nixon style, sported an American flag in his _lapel,
responded that the President had appointed the commission and allow-
ed it to make its report public, but was not obligated to accept its rec-
ommendations as binding. Huss, who said he had been studying the so-

4 ciological aspects of marijuana, replied, “I still think a man should
have an open mind.” V

Another student brought up the question of the wage-price freeze,
and asked Cox if he had. shopped in a grocery store lately. Cox replied
» that under his father-in-law’s wage-price proposals the average Amer-
ican worker was better off than he had ever been. i I ’

A student who professed to be a Quaker challenged Cox on Nix-
on‘s religious beliefs. The student. who said that members of the So-
ciety of Friends are pledged not to wage war with outward weapons, '
said he thought Nixon publicly proclaimed he was a Quaker to “clothe

himself as a peace maker.”

With his left hand tucked in his jacket pocket and his right making
a repetitive chopping gesture for emphasis, Cox replied, “I don’t think
he represents himself as a Quaker.” Pressed to comment further,- Cox5
said only that he understood the student’s point.

Picking up the war-peace theme, another student asked why the .V
President continues to support the Thieu regime in South Vietnam. Cox I
responded that every South Vietnames citizen has had the opportunity
to vote in the democratic elections Thieu had won. « '

The student countered this by saying no one had opposed Thieu
in those elections, and remarked further that Thieu had cancelled all
village and hamlet elections this fall. Cox'replied, “We hope they can
be restored,” and pointed, out that Britain had disposed of its elec-

tions during wartime in the 1940’s.

A public relations ‘aide stepped in then to take Cox before a press
conference in the Kurtzman Room. Although some students were per-
mitted to enter the room, others were barred by public relations aides
and campus police. It was reported that a student photographer with a
press pass from the Duquesne University Duke was also refused ad-

Office of Veterans Affairs lnstituted

Pitt Vets Offered New Programs

by KARL BALDYS

This month, plans are being fin-
alized to institute a new Office of
Veterans Affairs at Pitt. The of-
fice, part ofthe Office of Student
Affairs, will increase the num-
oer of veterans at Pitt while ex.-

 -panding services to those enrolled.

The Statement of Purpose. as
approved by Dr. Moye. Dean of
Student Affairs, defines the pro-
ject as an “outreach" recruit-
ment program that will hire and
train recruiters to " . actually
seek out veterans. with a special
concentration on minority and
disadvantaged men and women.
as well as the spouses of deceased
veterans.”

Academic services under the
new office would include special-
ized curricular and remedial pro-
grams for those vets‘ who need
them.

Financial aid and job placement

will also be available to the vet.
It will be the responsibility of the
new office to organize programs
under the Office of Student Aid
and the Job Placement Office. to
the advantage of the veteran. The
Counseling Center staff will be en-
larged to include veterans already
attending Pitt, to fulfill the need
for personal. as well as peer group
counseling.

According to Dr. Moye. there is
an urgent need for expanding
services for the.3.000 veterans at
Pitt. especially the Vietnam vet-
eran. Said Moye. "At no other
time has a veteran seen so little
respect from the citizenry . . .
there are no parades for this
man.“ He added. "With each suc-
ceeding war,. veterans’ benefits
have gone down. This whole pack-
age (i.e. provided by the govern-
ment) is less than it was for the
World War II vet.”

/

-George Sell, president of Vet-

   

erans at Pitt, which has been
pushing for increased veterans’
benefits, was pleased with the
new program, but cautious. “I
think we’ve come a long way,” he
said, “but the program isn’t set-
up yet.” .

Sell feels that the veteran has
a right to increased benefits as
provided by the Cranston Amend-
ment of the Higher Education Act
of 1972. This amendment pro-
vides. according to Sell, "$300 to
the University per vet. per year.
with no stipulation on how the
money is used.”

However, to qualify for this
money the University must enroll
ten percent more veterans for
the next academic year. Sell sees
the veterans at Pitt as a watch-
dog organization to make sure
that not only does the University
qualify for the federal money. but
also.‘ that more complet.e serv-
ices are provided for the‘ ex—GI_.

Sell will be a member of the
search committee evaluating ap-
plicants for the new department’s
permanent director.

At this time, no budget for the
organization has been approved.
However, under Student Affairs
official Peter Bauvier, the Office
of Veterans’ Affairs is temporari-
ly operating in 505 Schenley Hall.

The plans for the Office of Vet-

erans’ Affairs have been modeled
on programs already established
at UCLA, San Fernando State, and
other California schools. Accord-, 
ing to Dean Moye, no major uni-
versity in Pennsylvaniaihas a a
plan like the one that willbe in-
stituted here at Pitt. A
Moye added, “People will be 4.-
watching us very closely to see
how this turns out.” '

Jorgensonl Speaks at Pitt

CHRISTINE JORGENSON, a “woman” that was born a “man,” will
speak on gender identity problems in a program sponsored by the
Pitt Public Affairs Office Friday at 2:30 p.m. on the Bigelow lawn.
She will also appear at the Fitzy Ritz Coffeehouse at 8:30, p.m. Fri-

Jorgenson is credited with having received more newspaper
space than any individual in the history of journalism. Her unique
story has provoked a great deal of international curiosity.

Jorgenson, who‘ claims she “came close to marriage twice but
didn’t,” lived as a shy, effeminate man for 24 years before becom-
ing surgically transformed into a woman. ' ~ ‘

Enriches Social Opportunities

CA a Broadens Goals

The Commuter Association
(CA), interested in representing
the commuting student and en-
couraging involvement and inter-
action with people within the .Uni-
versity, is planning to expand and
enrich social opportunities for
commuters while continuing to
articulate their specific needs.

Union Director Terry Milani.‘

 ordinated a social program pro-

posing eight dances to be held in

 the Student Union Ballroom and
 ten afternoon coffeehouses to be

held in Dining Room A and B or

the Kurtzman Room.

The first CA dance will feature

S’ Zit Blemishes, a group parodying
j "the ‘*50’s” and will conclude Cycle

Week, sponsored by the CA. This
dance will be part of the Activ-
ities Fair being held Sept. 25-28.
The Cycle Week will include com-
petitive motorcycle and bicycle
events as well as cycle displays. '

Other social events‘ planned by
the CA will be a picnic at the shel-
ter in Schenley Park on Sept. 23,
an all night bowling and ice skat-
ing party at a county park and a
commuter day at Trees Hall.

Representing the 16,000 com-
muting students who on the aver-
age travel 45 minutes by bus or
car to Oakland, the CA plans to
work constructively with the Uni-
versity through the Student Af-
fairs Council and by lobbying. The
CA has experienced the slow but
successful power of lobbying in
the two year deliberation for the
student parking lot at Trees Hall.

gram which would provide free
parking at specified lots for‘ com-
muters riding into Oakland.

The CA is presently working
with the~Student Union staff as
the renovation of Sc'henley‘cafe-
teria is begun to provide a snack
bar, pool and pinball area, and
lounge for commuting students.

The influence of the CA lobbying
is ironically evident in the two
new bus shelters now located on
the wrong side of Forbes and Fifth

Loan Mix—up Leaves-
Sfucients Wondering  

Associa fed Press

A‘ foul-up in the‘, federal guarantee loan program has left thou-
sands of college students returning to campus across the country this
month without money to pay tuition.

The Education Act Amendment that became law June 21 changed

the ground rules for those loans and ledto what one college financial

aid officer called “the infamous interlude.’’ .

Tuition loans were previously granted to any student whose ad-
justed family income was less than $15,000. The new law required
schools ‘to confirm the “demonstrated financial need” of all students
seeking the low-cost loans. '

Regulation\s implementing the new law were not published by the
Office of Education until July 18, and immediately created confusion
for students, schools and lending institutions. \ —

The Office of Education respondedwith a proposal that the new
rules be dropped until March 1 of next year and the old rules reinstat-
ed. A joint resolution was passed by Congress in three days and signed
by the President on August 19. .

_“The emergency legislation eased the crunch considerably, but
there are widespread delays in getting applications ‘.processed,” said

’ Dick Tombaugh, executive director of the National Association of Stu-

dent Financial Aid Administrators.

“The slowdown is fantatastic. It willbe October or November be-
fore a lot of students get their money.” '

_Most colleges and universities have responded by allowing stu-
dents to register and take courses without paying tuition until their
loans come through. This will cost the schools money—the interest they
would have received by collecting the tuition money-and banking it.

Peace Campaign Set

A chapter of the Indo China
Peace Campaign, an organization
designed to inform citizens on the
facts of the Vietnam war, is being

‘ coordinated at the University by

Ken Steinbergand Joseph Morris,
-both students.

The purpose "of the campaign,

_ they said, “is to educate the peo-

ple on the facts of the war so that

they will keep in mind that a

vote in the November election is a
vote on the war.”

The organization is nonpartisan,
according to Steinberg, but he
admits that revealing the facts of
the war will aid Senator McGov-
ern’s chances in November.

Slide shows, movies, pamphlets

and speakers such as Jane Fonda, ‘

Pete lVlcCloskey, Tom Hayden will
serve to explain the facts as they

Cox’s advance man had failed, however, in his attempt to exclud
studentsifrom the conference. ‘One student who had entered the room
by some unknown means asked Cox, “If you are so interested in find

Cox replied, “I wanted to talk to the students informally, when they
I _ wouldn’t be overrun by the press.” Cox explained,“I did have/a shor

I had hoped I got an idea of the kinds of things that are on their minds

Asked by a member of the press, “Do you intend to talk with those

do.”

That was the last question of the conference. Cox’s advance man

’ The new Student Health Insur-
ance Plan is one of the finest in
the nation. But somewhere in the
process of implementation, one of
its best aspects has been misrep-
resented to the point where the
__ advantage has been turned into a
,5 liability. .

ated with Blue Cross, students
"housed in the dormitories have
the option of waiving the Student
Health Insurance Plan if they can
demonstrate that they are cover-
ed by other similar health insur-
ance.
, Yet, enclosed in the invoice
packet was a card which stated
“Students housed in University
of Pittsburgh Resident _Houses
_are required to participate in the
Student Health Insurance Plan as
a condition of their acceptance of
. the University housing contract.”

complaint and demonstrate that
they have sufficient insurance
coverage.

But how about the student who
doesn’t get to see the policy that
the University tells him he has
agreed to? How about the stu-
dent who doesn’t know that the po-
licy isn’t mandatory? All he

knows is that the University tells ~.

him he is required by contract to
spend $56 on insurance he may al-
ready have.

If the program isn’t mandatory,
why weren’t students sent the
proper information? If the pro-
gram isn_’t mandatory, why do
students have to go through the
bureaucraticrumaround?

We can never know how many
students have been coerced into
accepting insurance ' that they
may not need nor want. But the
least that Dr. Moye and officials
from Blue Cross can do is to noti-
fy all students living in the resi-
dence halls that an error was
made and then give students the
opportunity to cancel the student
health insurance.

If the Student Health Insurance

is as good as it is supposed to be,
then students at this University

» should be capable of evaluating

both the policy and their’own
needs and do not need coercive
instructions from University ad-
ministrators to insure them from
themselves.

Officers Defend-
Actions

ear Sir:

This letter is in response to
your article in Wednesday, Sept.
6, edition. As of this date, Offi-
cers John Forgie and Arnie Tarr
have been reinstated. The arbitra-
tor found no substance to the de-
partment’s charges and both men
are now back to work.

Concerning our case, several
items should be brought forward
and clarified at this time:

a. Our case is currently pending
arbitration. We have gone through
the grievance procedure which is
nonexistent, and the‘ University
has decided to uphold Gil’s deci-
sion. ’

b. In the article,,Mr. Gil states.
“Indiscriminantly becoming in-
volved in other work results in
loss of these services.” Our ar-
gument is that if a human life is
so expendable, then the Universi-
ty had better replace this individ-
ual as his judgment is not sound.
We "responded to a distress call by
city officers, lives were in danger,
be it lives of the officers, the gun-
man or innocent bystanders on
the street or looking out windows.
Our response had to be immediate
and no time could be spared by
waiting for a decision by a ser-
geant who was not aware of the
situation.

c. Mr. Gil states that we were
not one b.lock from the incident,as
we claimed. A check of the police
records, report number 16541 will
show that we gave our location as
Fifth Ave. and DeSoto St. We nev-
er claimed to be one block away.
We were eight b_locks from the in-
cident, eight blocks away, a rath-

, er insignificant distance to travel

when lives are at stake. We also
check a fraternity on McKee St.,

so we were not out of our jurisdic- ‘

tion.

d. Gil states that we were not
needed as the No. 4 Station was
having roll call for its oncoming
shift. This incident occurred at
Louisa and McK-ee and termin-
ated at approximately 355 McKee
St., a distance of approximately
two blocks. The men from No. 4
were on foot and we were in a pa-
trol car. We were more mobile
than the men on foot and arrived
on the scene before the, men com-
ing from No.4 Station.

e. The remark concerning a fire
fight, is assinine. We never consi-

‘ dered Oakland a combat zone.

men in police uniforms, in“a mark-
ed patrol car can hardly be mis-
taken as culprits.

f. With Mr. Gil making the above '

statement, another important fact
has come to bear on this case.
That is, that Mr. Gil "has changed
his story for the fourth time. This
is the fourth statement he has
made concerning the reason for
our suspension. Gil’s stories have

Women’s  

The fight for Women’s Studies
began at the University of Pitts-
burgh more than a year ago. Wo-
men from all sectors of the Univer-
sity were involved in gathering
support for the vote taken’ at
last fall’s meeting of the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences. When the
program was ariproved, a commit-
tee appointed by the Chancellor
began immediately searching for-
candidates and listing criteria for
appointment.

This fall, Pitt has a Women’s
Studies Program with three faculty

. members already teaching courses.

But input is still needed. For this
reason, an open hearing on Wo-
men’s Studies-will be held on
Friday, Sept. 15, in the Student
Union Ballroom from 10-12 a.m.

 

changed as often as our weather. 6

In our opinion, which incidently
is shared by other officers in the
department, if this incident or an
incident under similar circum-
stances occurred, any other offi-
cers responding to the call would
not receive any type of disciplin_-
ary action.

Mr. Gil has no police experience

or background. His background‘

has solely been as a security ad-
ministrator (Greyhound Bus and
more recently Carlow College,
from which positions his employ-
ment was terminated). We chal-
lenge Mr. Gill to show us where
his vast experience in police work
lies.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Tarr Protests
Reprisals

University Police Cfficer Ar-
nold Tarr was reinstated with
full back pay on Friday Septem-
ber 8. Officer Tarr protested
as a picket demonstrator at the
University Police Station against
what he believed to be “second
class citizen status” for police-
men here at the University.

Officer Tarr stated that police
officers had been denied due pro-
cess Constitutional Rights, and
subjected to an inequitable griev-
ance procedure and as a result
they have been subjected to to-
tally arbitrary decision making by
Police Department Management.

I decided to exercise my right
as an individual to protest such
conditions to call the attention_of
the University administration to
the matter. '

For exercising this right to 1

protest, I was fired by the depart-
ment management.

Yes! You guessed it, without .

“due process,” without consider-
ation of my “Constitutional rights.

I appealed the termination of
my employment through the griev-
ance procedure of the administra-
tion.

The grievances procedure avail-
able to me was similar to using
the'opposition’s umpires, playing
in their ball‘ park, under their
rules, and after you’ve been rul-
ed out.

By now you’re probably think-'

ing, “How did I expect to win
under these conditions?”

The answer:

—Being legally and morally cor-
rect in your position helps.

—Adding.some form of drama-
tic emphasis for attention to the
matter.

—Believing in the system and

Kathy Davis, student representa-
tive on the Women’s Studies com-
mittee explained that “the pur-
pose of the hearing is to let
people know about the program, its
history, and what it is now.”

The hearing will be both infor-
mational and action oriented.
Information will be available
about courses and interest groups
will be formed to work on vari-
ous aspects of the program. Ques-
tions about the program will‘
also be answered.

A major part of the hearing
will be the introduction of the
new faculty in the program.
They include Mary Louise Bris-
coe,' formerly- of the University
of Wisconsin at White Water,
Maureen Greenwald of Brown.
and Irene Frieze from UCLA.

’ causing it to work for you—in this
case, our administrators.
—Believing in humanity, com-
mon sense, courage, and not ig-
noring an individual’s rights even
if.it’s easier for a person to do so.

—-Hoping your faith in the ad-
ministration is well-founded.

Now you say WOW! Do we
have all these attributes in the
University administration here at
Pitt?

I think so; and to prove it, I
was reinstated with full back pay.

It was merely necessary to
cause the administration to demon-
strate it, for me, for you, and for
themselves.

Some people believe that my
position and approach on the mat-

' . ter was radical, militant, and down-
right troublesome.

In rebuttal to that I say, “What
is radical and militant about exer-
cising your right to defend your
rights?” '

Troublesome! Yes, indeed! Es-
pecially so, with a wife and sev-
en children to explain it all to
for being unemployed.

Troublesome! Yes, indeed! To
' my fellow officers who supported
me so courageously through it
all.

Troublesome! Yes, indeed! To
our labor organizations who sup-
ported me, and our brother la-
bor organizations here at the
University who supported me!

Troublesome! Yes, indeed! To ,
the many members of Faculty
and staff who supported me.

Troublesome! Yes indeed! but
not as troublesome, to the many
students and student represent-
atives who supported me. (It’s
easy for them! They’ll fight for
humanity and justice anytime.)

Troublesone! Yes, indeed, with
an “Oh my Yes!” to the admin-
istration of the University of Pitts- ,
burgh who had it all to consider
and resolved ; . . and they did.

‘Thank you all!

.5“!

by JOHN METCALFE

It may not have been the non-event of the year;
might not even be in the running, but Ed Cox want-.
ed to rap with me on Monday‘aftern.oon. An explana-
tory line on the flyer announcing.th'is wish described
‘him further as being the President’s son-in-law.

Not bad for a Monday The flyer, by the way.
was hand-lettered with a._felt-tip pen. The Republi-
cans have class, and they show it. No smeary
mimeograph for them. '

Actually, I saw the leaflet later, while the rap
itself was in progress. I originallyrlearned of the
visit in an oddly circuitous manner." I was lounging

' around on the Bigelow side of the Cathedral, looking
suave ‘and mourning the coolness of the day. With a
few spectacular exceptions, the young ladies were
swaddled to the earlobes in layer on layer of bunchy
sweaters. A friend who also is wont to lounge suave-
ly, and even carries aicamera, was there. He told
me/Ed Cox was coming.

. “Guess who’.s coming? Right here on campus.
Ed‘Cox, that’s who.”

He pointed out a tall gentleman in coat and tie,
wearing a white shirt. As my acquaintance with Mr.
Cox “is slight in the extreme, I thought this must be
the man himself. The white shirt confused me.

My friend corrected me gently. He pointed out
that ‘the gentleman in the suit was too tall, and that
his hair wasdark. ‘Indeed, his dark hair reached
clear to his white collar. This could not be our dis-
tinguished visitor. But the tall man was conspi-
cuous; by watching him we might be able to detect
Mr. Cox’s arrival.

It had been the man in the suit. himself who told.
my friend of the impending visit. Seeing the camera,
he had approached my friend to inquire whether he

' wished to photograph Mr. Cox for the newspaper. .

Until then, he had not. '

The arrival was scheduled for 11:30. Knowing
that courtesy andpromptness are mgmy regarded
by Mr. Cox and his family, we thought it well; _worth
waitingseven minutes for a glimpse of him. By
. climbing a tree, we might even manage to see over

‘ the heads of his welcoming. We whiled away the

time exchanging anecdotes we had .heard about
Mr. Cox and his prominent relations. -

We nearly exhausted our supply. It was to 20
to 12. No visitors. No welcoming committee. I sug-
gested that my friend might have been the victim of

_ a "prank, though the tall man did not seem the sort
tojest about anything so important. '

Now there was avflurry of activity. The man in
the suit was jointed ‘by another nattily dressed man,

in coordinated beige. His jacket was ligher than his

trousers, and his brown socks matched his tie. “A
Young Republican,” I guessed. They were joined
by yet another suited man and a trimly gotup
young lady with black stockings. .

They moved ‘purposefully toward B_igelow as a
car pulled into  suddenly vacant parking space at
the end -ofthe walk. It was not a flashy car—-a" mod-
est Plymouth in two-tone beige, equipped with all

The Political Nonevent of The Year  

the optional extra safety features.

The driver was probably Republican, if not ex-
actly Young.

After cordial greetings and handshakes in
which the palms were pressed firmly together, the
party from the car and their greeters moved
smoothly to the Cathedral. The smooth blond one in
the middle was Mr. Cox. ’

Though many students passed, some near

enough to touch him. they all showed restraint all

too rare these days. Nobodv even acknowledged that
they had recognized him. He seemed almost dazed
at- finding such breeding here. His classmates at
H'arv,ard'had undoubtedly told him Pitt was provin-
cial. Perhaps he had even believed them.

The party vanishedinto the bowels of the Ca-
thedral, andmany anxious moments followed. As it
was so near the stroke of noon, we feared he might
let hunger get the better of wisdom and attempt to
eat in the Tuck’ Shop. Our fears were groundless;
Mr. Cox ‘was “rapping” with law students, who en-
joy,“rapping” as much as he does, so far as my

' friend: knows.

The driver had stayed in the car after putting a
coin in the meter. I looked at it in the hope of learn-
ing how .long the visit would be..The meter showed
an hour and 15 minutes, which may have been mis-
leading. It’s possible Republicans never carry
anything smaller than a quarter.

That may sound biased and partisan. It is not.
While I am not a Republican, neither am I a Demo-
crat. I’ll share a rumor to prove it. Word has it Mc-
Govern’s campaign will be limited to those small
towns where the meters will accept pennies.

After awhile the driver left the car and walked

toward the Student Union. 'Curiousit'y drew me to
examine the car, and thus I made a scandalous dis-

*covery. The automobile was ordinary enough—reg-

istered in "Pennsylvania. No gaudy initials, just
an everyday license plate. No fancy communica
tions gear, either. But there was a shock. ' - ‘

On the back seat, in plain view was a briefcase.
Not one of your'five—and-‘ten vinyl specials either-
good leather, and probably stuf-fed withvaluables
and important papers. .

I had not even begun to recover from this shock
when I made an even more startling discovery.

The left rear door was unlocked.

I shudder to think what might have happened
had I not been there. A passing stranger, till now
innocent of any wish to defy the law might well have
been tempted into that first fatalstep toward a life
of crime. _ ' ' ‘

As a result, I did not get to the “rap-session”
until after the driver returned. By then all the stu-
dents had been cleared from the room due to a

. strong suspicion, that some of them might wish to

ask embarrassing questions. This sort of “grand-
standing” (I borrowed that word from a member
of Mr. Cox’s staff) was hardly consistent with the,
dignity of the office of the Presidents’ son-in-law
(the other one, not David). .

mended for deciding to stretch
out their time in the classroom

for another four years and for

realizing that they can better

themselves by earning their
sheepskin, (of course, that is
highly debatable).

They are to be pitied, because
each September, without fail,
there is someone who wishes to
help the college freshman adjust
to his or her new way of life by
passing a bit of free advice-
whether it is wanted or not.

What kind of advice does our

“would-be counselor”. give?
For the young man fresh out of

high—schoo1, who has not likely_

sown his wild oats, he tells him
that dorm life is everything that
his parents were afraid it would
be.

The new co-ed, who may not
be as, to coin a popular word,
“horny” as her fellow freshman
of the opposite sex, is told that if
she holds down the flame of sexu-
al desire for-four years she is
not human. She is told virginity
is not important anymore. When
a woman does marry, she doesn’t

tellher husband about her pre-
marital experiences.

For the co-ed who decides to
“join the crowd,” she may seek
out a Ms. upperclasswoman to
learn what precautionary mea-

sures are needed to indulge safely

and carefreely. The girl who de-
cides that she'd rather be safe
than sorry is told she will find

a lot of time for study on week- >

ends.

The guy, God forbid, who de-
cides on such all safe course of
action, will find it necessary to
indulge in the age-old remedy of
plenty of exercise and a cold
shower.

Of course, there is also the
scholastic side of college. A col-
lege freshman will need a lot of
will-power in order to study in-
stead of goofing around with the

l)eath Penalty.

Has. Proponent

by WILLIAM DIMASCIO
Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP)~The
district attorney of Philadelphia,
trying to skirt the U.S. Supreme
Court ruling outlawing the death
penalty, proposed legislation Mon-
daytto restore capital punishment
in Pennsylvania.

At a news conference before
the measure was introduced in
the State Senate, District Attorn-
ey Arlen Specter said it was "very
carefully drawn to comply” with
the high court decision.

The proposal would require that
the death penalty be imposed on
all first-degree murders who fall
within one of eight specific cate-
gories. All death sentences would
be reviewed immediately by the
Board of Pardons which could re-
duce them to life imprisonment if
certain mitigating circumstances

are present.

Specter said under his proposal.

there could be no discriminator
application because of the speci-
fic guidelines and the mandatory
nature of the sentence. The guide-
lines:

Murder of on-duty police or fire- :7

men; by a paid killer, assassin,
previously convicted first-degree
murderer, or persons serving a
life sentence, or during a hijack-
ing, kidnapping or arson, rape,
robbery or burglary where the
person was convicted before of ar-
son, rape, robbery or burglary.

Comes

Together

By KARL BALDYS

On September twenty first, a
revitalized Pi Delta Epsilon,
along with the office of Student
Publications, will sponsor a Me-
dia Fair. The purpose of the Fair
is to bring all the Pitt communi-
cations media, including the Ma-
gic Bus, the Free Press, the' Black
Action News, WPGH, and others,
together, for a day of exposition.

According to Charles Kostecki,
president of the organization,
“Pi Delta Epsilon is responsible
for leadership in journalism. We

want to do something for the

student publications, to bring
them together.” Kostecki thinks
that the Student Media Fair will
dojust that. -

The various groups will, in

I the words of Kostecki, “Exhibit

‘I-.r

their wares in the Student Union
Ballroom to offer the publica-
tions a chance to recruit students
while giving the students a
chance to know what the Pitt
publications are about.”

Planning for the meeting be-I

gan as early as June when Ms.
Eleanor Walsh, former head of
Student Publications, joined forc-
es with Pi Delta Epsilon. “We
wanted to create a supermarket
for the students.” said Kostecki.

Lost, confused and questioning
Freshmen should now be a thing
of the past at Pitt-Ithanks to the
new and entertaining edition of
the Polaris. -

This student handbook provides,
says Jeff Pasek, “a key to san-
ity” for all freshmen. It is de-
signed to acquaint all new stu-
dents with college life at Pitt.
It tells of things to do, places to
go (with directions) plus the tra-
ditional freshmen pictures. This
year the names and addresses of
about 1800 freshmen are availa-
ble.

And the Polaris is an informal,
clever booklet. Chancellor Pos-
var is pictured with the caption,
“TA-DAAI”, and scores of puns
are scattered throughout the pag-
es._ It also gives information on
the Free Clinic and Planned Par-
enthood. It tells of different kinds
of transportation: the best and
most economical way to get to
the airport, and the many routes
provided by buses.

‘ People in -Administrative_ Of-i
fices arelisted, helping the stu-_

dent to avoid a red-tape run-

for important University num-
tiers.

And for future-conscious fresh-
men, this booklet illustrates the
procedures involved in applying
for graduation.

Steinberg Views Season's Prospects-

By ANDREW J. SOPKO

Arts Editor I
With this Friday, the symph-
ony season will be with us again.
and it was «with that season in

"mind that the members of the

press r e c e n t l v chatted with
Dr. Steinberg. Looking more rest-
ed and refreshed than most of us
could remember, Steinberg show-
ed a decidedly optimistic out-
look in regard to the upcoming
year’s prospects.

It would hardly be a rash state-

ment to remark that the conduct--

or of our local "orchestra has more
than admirably molded his "in-
strument” into one of interna-
tional repute during his past
decade of association with the
g1‘0,UP-

Prominent in the conversation
of the afternoon was this year’s
third series addition to the cus-
tomary pair of weekend concerts.
While Steinberg reminded us that
the new series was of an “ex-
perimental” nature, he was quick
to point out that, once again, the
entire series was sold out com-
pletely. The only irksome thing
about this is the fact that many
enthusiasts will be turned away
once again in light of the ticket
shortage.

When one reflects upon the
idea of three weekly concerts in
regard to a city of our size, a
certain amount of surprise is very
definitely in order. For all our
provincialism (and we would still
have that to deal with even if we
had seven concerts a week), very,
very few cities have such an ex-
tended concert series. Chicago,
New York, and Boston come to
mind. but their populations are
much larger and we take the cul-
tural resourcefulness of these‘
cities for granted (something
which we unfortunately cannot
do with our fair metropolis).

Steinberg also expressed satis-
faction over the new three con-
(ductor situation which also
makes its debut this season. In
addition to himself and Mr. Jo-
hanos, Michael Semanitzky will

appear on the podium as assist-
ant conductor. The music direc-
tor will be making his usual guest
appearances with various orches-
tras. Highlighting these guest
appearances will be an eight

week engagement in Boston.

STEINBERG: Twenty—one years
with orchestra.

Being an international orches-
tra entails _one very important
prerequisite: the ensemble must
be, known internationally. That
prerequisite was filled in 1964,
when the State Department sent
our symphony to Europe. With
that trip still in mind, our or-
chestra now turns its attention
to the Far East and its upcoming
trip to Japan which is scheduled
for next April. According to
Steinberg, the trip will be fin-
anced by the symphony. No State
Department funds this time.

I suppose that there was a time
when most of us would have gasp-
ed had we been told that our
symphony was financing an in-
ternational trip. "But times have
changed and we hardly can pre-
tend to be unaware that the PS0
has the greatest financial en-
dowment of any American orches-
tra.

Before the session ended, I did
question, Dr. Steinberg concern-
ing the almost total absence of
certain composers on our sym-
phony programs. Quite frankly.

he admitted that he was definitely
biased in choosing works and he
gave a number ofreasons for his
attitudes. And while his reasons
were understandable and well
founded, I still feel that there are
many unheard works which are far
more worthy than many we have
heard. and I can only hope for the
time when these compositions
will be included. (I am naturally
showing my bias in this respect
as well).

With the new season immed-
iately before us, we all are look-
ing forward to some very fine
musical experiences in the months
to come. We are indeed, fortunate

to have the PS0 in our midst;'

the only unfortunate thing is that
everyone who would like to be
a regular symphony subscriber
can not in light of the recent
sellouts.

One cannot help but compare '

this dilemma with a tale told of
Bostonian audiences: The only
wayto receive a season ticket
in that city years ago was to make
certain that one was bequeathed
to you. Things are almost compar-
able to that in Pittsburgh now.
But. who knows? Perhaps by
next season we will have yet an-
other series of symphony con-
certs added to our present trilogy.

ilEmerson, Lake 8:00. Palmer Combine Moods,ilrn‘luences

‘Trilogy':Tension Gives Way to Good Humor

By BARBARA GERAUD

Something happens half-way
through Emerson Lake & Palmer‘s
Trilogy (Cotillion) that their ster-
nest critics might find unusual.
The group relaxes. And they rock.
And the tension that is so evident
in most of their work gives way
to a good—h'umored album.

There is a great deal of varie-
ty on Trilogy, which is basically
the story of the three musicians.
their different influences. moods
and attitudes. which combine into
the intense. indefinable entity
that is ELP.

They certainly aren’t above cri-
ticism; many find the group pre-
tentious, flashy, or—and this I
really can’t believe—boring. Yet
they are continually innovative,
deriving themes and counterpoints

from old classical pieces, modern- .

izing them, and transposing “clas-
sical”, into “modern”——thereby
gaining a whole new audience for
themselves (those who like mod-
ern music) and leading thse new-
found sheep into the fold of clas-
sical expression.

dug up. So Keith Emerson and
friends have gained some new
converts to their original modes
of expression. ‘

There isn’t much blues to the
group, either. Yet Keith’s almost
fanatical devotion to keyboards-
be they connected to organs, pi-
anos, synthesizers or mellotrous—
is as emotional as any of the 12-
bar freaks—Clapton, B. B. King,
et. al.

Emerson is like a race between
mind and body. Both his ideas
and technique seem to be push-
ing ahead , in parallel develop-
ment. Almost feverishly, he rushes
into things, trying to find a new
combination on his Moog, trying
to put into music the disconnect-
ed fragments he hears racing
through his brain. And Greg and
Carl are both determined to keep
up with him in this race.

The result is that between them.
they can command a whole bat-
tery of musical modes and "sounds
until the albums sound like or-
chestras\ instead of a three-man
band. Greg Lake's production is
largely responsible for this—he
seems to be one of the.few peo-
ple able to translate Keith’s ec-
lectic imagination into black vinyl.

This is particularly noticeable.
on “Abbadon’s Bolero,” one of the
most effective compositions he has
yet produced. The long line of the

.bolero rhythm keeps a rein on

his phrasing and construction, so
the discipline is obtained, result-
ing in the power that comes
from restraint.

,His use of synthesizers, com-
bined with Greg’s frenetic bass
guitar and Carl’s drums, wind
up the bolero with a symphonic
grandeur that, especially in the
final chorus, is quite staggering.

SEPTEMBER 15th, FRIDAY, 7 :30 Pi.M.

In contrast to Keith’s intensity
(when you suddenly get the feel-
ing that there aren’t enough keys
on the synthesizer or his organ
and he's trying to play the cracks).
there is a steadily growing mat-
urity in the guitar and voice of
Greg Lake that helps immeasur-
ably in binding all together.

His “From the Beginning” is a
very relaxed tune, encompassing
an earthy Lennon-type vocal and
an almost choral style. Greg’s
voice has this hypnotic quality
about it-it holds one’s attention
and immerses him in the lyric.“

Carl’s drumming has also chang-
ed quite consideraby. For some
time he has been apparently dis-
satisfied with mere speed and
attack at his kit, and although he
does do that beautifully, it is sig-
nificant that one of the few
drum solos he gets on the album
is quite out of character.

_This comes at the beginning of
“The Sheriff.” Amidst much cow-
poking and clouting of wooden
sculls, Palmer lays into an in-
troduction that clobbers around
his kit like the heaviest of rock
drummers.

The album is an altogether wor-

thy successor to their first two,

studio productions, and shows the
band still has a lot more music
to play. In fact, the possibilities.
are endless, and one gets the im-
pression they are leaving out a
lot more than they put in.‘

The opening number is "The
Endless Enigma,” a Moog crying
somewhere in the wilderness, like
the first stirrings in the primeaval
mud. Keith crashes menacing stac-
cato chords, and it would be quite
effective in a Stanley Kubrick
epic. “Fugus Emerson” is a chance
for Keith to tinker around on
piano—his first love—-all by his
lonesome.

"The Endless Enigma" is fea-
tured again, in different form,
then comes “From the Begin-
ning,” Greg’s number showing a
beautiful, harmonic gentleness
that is quite out of character for
the group; therein lies its joy.

“The Sheriff” is a cute bar-
oque country & western tune, and
should be" a single hit, if released.
This is followed by “Hoedown,”

Greenblat Inspired by

 

ii.iAtro-American Tradition

By STEVE LUBETSKY

'- Editors ‘note: This is the first in a series of entertainment or-
ticles spotlighting Iocal talent.

. .V " i Many musicians consider the voice as a musical instligurneiit 
they can employ at their Cl1SCI‘el'.l0l’l.. Lee_Greenblat, mu i—ins ru
_ talist from Shadyside, views the relationship in reverse. a

« “Any instrument should. be nothing more than an extension Of the
1 voice.‘ Emphasis should be on feeling rather than technique.

Now 20, Greenblat began his _musical‘ experience at 1.2, ivvhglmlﬁ
-learned the guitar. Greenblat claims that, P1ay1_ng_ m“'{S"3 ist féel
thing that happens to you, you dont know what it is. on J
like it" should be there.”

‘ lofthe music I had been playing.

Greenblat describes his encounter with the blues as “something

that was really real. There are certain subtleties and beauties and
tradition within it (blues) that just made something there.”
I - Law devoted most of his energy to his guitar until a year ago
when he picked up an alto saxophone. “I enjoy the sax more now,”
he admitted, “because I canmake it talk, So I practice the horn all

tar, butrather to further acquaint himself with other musical instru-
ments. “I utilize the piano more now for composition, and I want to
study other wind_instruments such as flute, bass clarinet, and oboe.
I can still pick it (the guitar) up and play when I want to.”

- Lee’s versatility is reflected in his diverse range of influences.

Included are the late John Coltrane and Charlie Parker, Ken McIn-
tyre, Cecil Taylor, and Sam Rivers, to name a few, all of whom he
regards as “deep players and part of an endless list of committed and
great musicians. I also really dig cats like Al Green and the Stylis-
_ -tics," he added. “They’re all part of a distinctive tradition of mu-
- sic.” ' —
 A music major at State University of New ‘York, the College at
Old Westbury, Lee has been studying with multi-inst_rumentalist'l,{en
Mclntyre, who has worked with Cecil»Taylor and Eric Dolphy. He"
performed with McIntyre in a concert of his (McIntyre’s) composi-
 ~ tions last spring.

‘ Inasmuch as he enjoys playing‘, however, Lee is frustrated by
the “limited availability of work and the commercial demands" plac-
.ed~ upon him. “I -have a deep disgust for the association between the
_ 5musician and the barroom,” he affirmed. “You become an asset to

 ‘aspects to name." _

 __  Greenblat hopes to" become a certified music teacher and insti-

tutereforms in the curriculum of his department. ‘.‘After I get the
papers I need to teach,” he asserted, “I hope to make some changes
in the present curriculum and enlarge the emphasis on African-
’American music in high schools, dealing with aspects of improvi-
sation and recognizing the originators of the art form. ' P
- There is-a certain’element of limitation within the Music De-
partment (of public schools), and at this time I‘couldn’t tie a bridge
between what I was doing and high school.”

 In the, meantime, Lee wants to broaden his knowledge to the
fullest. “The point that I’m shooting for now is to enjoy the present.
' develop what I have to the greatest self-realization, and let the future
 take care of itself.” .

First Transcendental) Exposition

  

Rock Opera Presented at Mosque

By JOHN CAPITMAN

What can one say about the
First Transcendental Exposition,
a Rock Opera, except that it
was nice, and that it gave us nice
boys and girls some nice music
and some nice food. A member of
the Hare Krishna Movement’s
hierarchy, a religious sect that
presented the show at the Syris
Mosque on Friday night, had

more to say. Insteadof introduc-

ing himself he said “In the ma-
terial world, names mean some-
thing, but for us they are noth-
ing, they are only extensions of
false body and false ego.”

He was a short man with ap-
propriately short hair, and those
long orange robes that many ad-
'more as a gaudy trademark for
the cult’s rejection of material-
ism. And yet one could not help
but notice the little vanities; ex-
traneous ornaments such as-a
VW medalion hanging with his
prayer beads, or the conspicuous-
ly faded though clearly expensive
sweater.

The ambiguities hinted at by
this swami’s garb were reflected
in the clothing of the audience,

which ranged from blond teeny- .

bopper record and experience col-

lectors, to dark bohemian affici-i

anados of Rock Opera and spirit-
ual refinement; from a Pitt sopho-
more who had been “slowly learn-
ing the truth from he Hare Krish-
-na people,” to a Golden Triangle

Executive, who “has children in-

the movement and felt that he
and his wife owed them the re-
spect‘ to hear them out.”

All of the audience was not so‘
tolerant as this executive; many
did not hear them out till 12:15

when we were finally permitted »

to leave the theater. Others left
discontentedly clutching their
fifty cent pamphlet on the joys
of yoga that had been forced upon
lthem by “those beautifully sin-
cere people.” And beautifully
sincere they were, from pretend-
ing on several occasions that the
amplification equipment was
“dead”, so that they could chant

L a kirtan at us (you know Hare

. Krishna etc. —- which by the way,
means Gloria in Excelsis Deo —
or as in the vernacular, “Praise
the Lord,” to prostrating them-
selves in the lobby during the
intermission to sell books.

Yes they are sincere because
they could jump higher and more
excitedly then we could, to the
beat of their ageless chant, and
they could smile harder and look
far more stoned than we ever
could want to, and most import-
antly they were happier than
we poor lost souls on the streets
of . Pittsburgh, because “happi-
ness” is whatconcerns them most.

“Happiness and everlasting
life through the service of Krish-
na, the ever joyful youth, these
are the important considerations
for any man who would reach
heaven, rather than having his
soul transmigrated to the body of
a beast. This is a fact!” said a
sour-faced yet imposing septe-
genarian, AG Bhaktivensista Swa-
mi Prabhupada, as he sat sur-
rounded by flowers on an ornate

_ Indian couch that dominated the

stage. He, the founder and spir-
itual leader of the Hare Krishna

evangelical movement, preached’

to an unsuspecting audience at

the beginning of the perform-.

ance, with his kneeling disciples
at his feet. There was one de-

votee who was honored with‘ the"

task of waving a brightly col-
ored fan at him, to keep him com-
fortable, in his “false ' body”,

while he recited and translated"

from the Bhagavad-Gita.

The swami’s English is excel-
lent, yet the concentration nec-
sary to follow him was more than
the audience around‘ me or I
could muster up. We were all

I struggling to keep awake during

the sermon. When the Swami
Prabhupada finished the aud-
ience perked up again and were
“entertained” by a Hindu pas-
sion—play for our times, a Rock
Operetta (for it was not really an

‘.opera) based on the principals of

the Gitas.

Marshall McCluen and a fear
of commercial brainwashing tech-

niques ‘made for one question.

that I asked the Hare Krishna of-
ficial mentioned above. “The
young people of today, in this

country are suffering, and this

alone iswhat they like, so they
will understand it. If they under-

stand, they will come with us,_

Your worry about taste.is anamal-
ism, a dog barks because he
doesn’t like this or that. A man is
different, if he sees another man
dying, he does what he can to save
him, it doesn’t matter what he
does, it he saves him. Why or

how can you object to this? Oh-

ject to our philosophy if you can.
But aesthetic is liketaste, it is
for dogs, itonly brings death, we

bring. Krishna consciousness"and'

eternal life.”

‘His views are so stated that to
go on with‘ this critique ‘after re-I
peating them seems perhaps fool-
ish, yet I believe that the faults
in the medium suggest the faults

in the philosophy. RINGER, the,

anti-hero who is saved by Krish-
na, is presented as the stereotype
of "young America; he is the ego-
entric, drug-orienter repressed
homosexual lover, who will in

time become a businessman. He"

has neither political conscious-

i ness, nor predetermined goals, nor

channeled ambitions.

He is the image of alienated
youth that symbolizes what most
viable movements are rejecting, in
this country — and yet he is por-
trayed as Hare Krishna material,
and yet he is portrayed as what
every one of us really is. If we
are to accept this pessimistic
View of our contemporaries, then
no revolution spiritual or politi-
cal is of any value, for we are
already lost.

But in the First Transcenden-
tal Exposition, with this and other
more pessimistic views of our
society, there is presented only
one solution: escape. This view-
places the Rock Opera as anoth-
er example of the art of escape,
and will make it as pleasing to
its’ cultists as C.S. Lewis’s Nar-
nia Stories. For Ringer is taught,
as the piece progresses, how ‘to
leave this world and go to an-
other. a heaven, a paradise—call—

Yet this concept, like the drug-
culture that the sect scorns, pre-
sents no alternative but self—satis-
faction, and in" that way only,
the worlds redemption. By sing-
ing the praises of Krihna and
“Rama his ever-beautiful spouse,”

tion with an immediate result.

But will chanting one’s mantra
end the war, patch up the econo-
my, or rebuild the ecology?—I
think not. The First Transcenden-
tal Exposition never claims that
it will —only thatecstasy and
everlasting life will be attained.
But what value do these things
have in a world beset with ma-
terial difficulties of the nature
and magnitude of those that we
face?

It would be pointless to discuss: H

in detail the technical problems
with the iF.T.E. production, for
the swami that I talked to felt
that “the nice boys and girls
had done a good job.” Yet. the
music showed‘ little variation

as it became‘ more prosaic andr.)

anguished and as the trite lyrics
became more ecstatic,and at best
it seemed shallow compared to
the Krishna—high of the franti-

cally joyful chanting. This “mus- ~ -

ic” was played at maximum vol-
ume against a disconcerting set
which somehow placed psycha-
delic posters, tie-dye cloth, and
ancient Indian temple accoutre-
ments in continuous view. .

At the same time, one should

be embarrassed to discuss fully
the choreography of leap and shuf-
fle which was more impres-
sively athletic than rhythmically
accurate, but which served as
an affective counterbalance to

the endless "and ineffectual pantoag

mime and the almost non-exist-"
ant character development.

But all of this does seem petty-
when viewed in the light of , the
admirable rejection of material
wealth and frighteningly sincere
misconceptions of the Hare Krish-
na Movement. That the First
Transcendental Exposition was
an interesting experience in this
presidential year is undeniable,
for it demonstrated the discontent
with the organization and priori-
ties of our society that is shared
by so many factions in this coun-
try and the false hope and bad
direction given by our political
and religious leadership.

Steubenville In  

/vliHer's Opener

A 7 ' by RICK ROSENTHAL

_Steubenvil1ex.College from the
‘city _by the same name in Ohio,
 -6 comes to Pitt Wednesday after-
»  noon at 3:30 p.m. to prove if they
V ' are as good a squad as there first
 year coach believe_s them to be.

I Steubenville was not anywhere
neara power in baseball last year,
___but a team of. newly recruited
’ freshman-' seems to be giving -first
.' year coach Rod Bower a reason
for. optimism. Pitt played the
Ohioan’s twice last year and easi-
ly defeated them each time, but
 things might not be thesame this
 time around. -

The reasoning behind the pessi-
4 gmism over tomorrow’s game is
 . well founded according to Pitt
Coach Bob Lewis as his troopers
fiﬂaret having. their first practice
6 ‘Monday’, only two days before the
opening game. However, Lewis is
 using" fall baseball merely as a
 means‘ for searching for talent
 and not playing each game as it
' was his l_ast. \
.. Lewis feels that the fall season
‘ is an opportunity that the squad
has needed for many years and is
-. happy that it is finally a reality.
"There will be no more practicing
' » on a _wooden gym fl00l'- as is the

   

  
 
  
  
  
   
  
  
 

 

   

 

' case during the early spring prac-

tice.
“Most of the guys- coming out

for the squad played summer ball

and are in peak ‘condition for their
new chance at a ‘berth on the
team,” said Coach Lewis.

The Steubenville squad faced a
tough‘ opponentthis week in ‘the
Dukes of Duquesne and split a
doubleheader with‘ them, losing,
the first game, 5-4, and winning

-the "second, 5-1. They have 26

more games‘ remaining on their
heavy’ fall schedule and before it
is completed they will find out

‘just how‘ good their new fresh-

man are.

The Steubenville’. game is not

really a true indication of the
Lewismen"s talents, because ac-_
cording to Lewis, two days prac-
tice just is not enough time to put

a team together‘. The pitching

_during the game will be shared
by four or five of ‘the Pitt pitchers

. with either Al Sylanski or Mike

Fedoris getting the starting nod.

Lewis plans to get a look at as
many players as possible and
feels that the fall games should be
a great vehicle through whichthat
end can be achieved.

_ The Pitt soccer team kicks off
its 1972 season this’ Saturday

against a tough Bucknell team atv

Lewisburg, Pa. The Bisions fin-
ished with a dismal 5-6-1 record
last year but Pitt coach Leo Bem-
is notes, “They are a hustling
team and we have never beaten
them at home.”

Last season the Panthers nipped
Bucknell, 2-0, on a pair of fourth
quarter goals here at Pitt. How-
ever, this years’ Pitt lineup will
not be the same one that faced
the Bisions, at least not on the of-
fense.

Besides losing a few offensive
stars from graduation, injuries
are beginning to take a toll on
the booters. Winger Kevin Crow-
ley has been lost to the club for
three months while recuperating
from an operation that restored
torn ligaments in one ankle.

Another wing, Bill Rex, will
be practicing with the team for
only the first time this week and is
listed as a doubtful starter for
Saturday’s contest.

Inside forwards Joe Luxbacher
and Tony Bolea are both coming
off injuries but are definitely
slated to play against Bucknell.
Boles, a J.V. star last year, is
suffering from a broken thumb
but will play with a cast on his
arm.

-sThe defense, on the other hand,
is in excellent shape and is pro-
bably the most solid part of the
team. ‘Returning lettermen Len
Raffa, Denny Koczak, Denny
Kohlmeyer, Gary Midock and Fer-
nando Carriquiry will provide

the booters with more than enough -

protection.

But in order to win soccer gam-
es you have to score goals and
that is exactly how coach Bemis
feels. “If you don’t have an of-
fense then you're in trouble,”
he stated. '

Question: by JERRY‘ MYERS,

If I am correct in assuming that

medal winner prior to the '72 I

Olympics, was “the man to beat.”
But even then he was confident
about his ability towin and for
good reason."

Rydze is not new at finding him-
self in the winner’s circle. Over
the past four years,- he has col-
lected seven national Amateur

Athletic Union (AAU) platform_

diving titles —— three indoor and
four outdoor - and has also cap-
tured the silver medal at the Pan
American games in Cali, Colum-
bia. ’
During the Olympics there was
much discussion over the incon-
sistency in the judgements made
by the Olympic officials. Early

this spring Rydze was awaregof , . j

 

 

 

In goal the booters have five
candidates struggling for the po-
sition. The most noteworthy ‘to
watch will be senior Steve Fib-
el and Junior Bill Haines. Fibel
was the starting goalie last sea-
son but Haines is running neck
and neck with him. Freshman
netminder Eric Holt is also high
on Bemis’ list.

The game against the Bisions
will be of importance mainly be-
cause Pitt has yet to return vic-
torious from Lewisburg. The con-
test might also set a precedent
for an initial style oflay on the
road. .. '

Aside from perhaps a pair of
away games to come, the Pan-
thers will be facing what might
be considered inferio competi-
tion when ‘they travel from home.
The Bucknell contest will also
provide an adequate -prep for the
booter’s open-at Pitt Stadium,
Saturday, Sept. 23, against West
Chester.

The boothers, previously suffer-
ing from a lack of practice time,
have finally gotten onto a regu-
lar practice schedule and should,
be ready for the Bisions, at least”
mentally. ' '

“We are a highly spirited team
and have designs» on winning,”
says Bemis. Last week the Pan-
thers won two scrimmage match-
es, downing Duquesne and Point
Park. '

Bemis predicted, “I see no rea-
son why we can’t expect a win-
ning season right from the start.
We might be a little slow round-
ing into shape, but we are capa-
ble of beating any team on our
schedule.”

He admitted that the season will
not be an easy one.

“Most of the teams on our schf-2;?
dule have improved. Weill .jus .
have to be the most together out-

fit on the field. We don’t have the -

ers and good spirit,”

Senior. quarterback John’.Hogan thought he was re-
ceiving some v_ery bad vibes last spring when head foot-
ball coach Carl DePasqua announced that he intended on
employing the Wishbone-T offense in the fall. John Hogan
loves to pass the football and the Wishbone offense loves
to run.

Apparently dejected then, Hogan conceded that he
wasn't that thrilled about it, but that he was going to see
how he could help.

If anyone on the team should have reported to the
Johnstown summer camp with a “bad” attitude, Hogan
should have been the one. With all the news clippings pro-
claiming Bob Medwid as the Wishbone maker, Pitt savior,
etc., Hogan seemed to be being pushed out of the picture.

At football camp though, Hogie, as he is known to his
roomie John White, came back in the best of shape, both
physically and mentally.

“I got my head together during the summer,” he said,
following one of the afternoon summer drills. I’ve been
doing all right, I came back with a pretty good attitude
and I’m more confident about the Wishbone now.”

, When John was a young boy, he displayed the desire
to throw the football. His brother, Gary, who was a quar-

terback at Purdue University in 1961-63 taught him some)

fundamentals and today Hogan can throw the ball 50

yards with accuracy.

To this day, Hogan’s most memorable performance
was in his first game, against UCLA twoyears ago. In
that game Hogan completed 29 passes to tie Dave Hav-
em for the all-time Pitt record. He just missed leading
Pitt to a victory. ’ ’

John didn’t know it then, but that job was not a pre-
lude of what was to happen to him that season.

In fact, since DePasqua entry in 1969, he has only had
a quarterback for a whole year, his first. Since then, it
has been weekly thing.

The mortality rate for Pitt quarterbacks has been
high the last couple of years. This more than any other
reason has led to the confusion.

“I’ve never had a quarterback for a whole season,”
remembered DePasqua Monday. The quarterback has al-
ways been hurt.” (.1

‘Hogie'--Sandwiched Between

The reason DePasqua was remembering that 

that he now faces a similar situation. Though no quarter-
back got hurt Saturday, the number one job is still up

in the air as the team prepares for the Uclans of UCLA. »

“I’m not really a runner,” said Hogan. “Every time
I’ve gotten hurt’ I was running the ball. I’m a realist. I

_don’t know how long I can last as a runner.
The only goal I am setting this year is not to get.

hurt. I will just wait for my chance and hope I can take
command when the time comes.”

Hogan’s chance came a short week after he made his
statement.

In the middle of the second quar-
ter against Florida State, Medwid
failed to push the ball into the end
zone, despite repeated ‘opportunities.
Hogan came in and directed a 67
yard, seven play drive to cop Pitt’s
only touchdown. "

The FSU line was often stacked

against the Pitt Wishbone. Because
of this and because the Panthers fell 

. behind, Hogan_ took to the air to do his primary thing of

passing the ball. As far asfuture playing time, Hogan is
sandwiched inbetween Medwids blatent ability, Pitt's de-
sire to mainly run, and an enigma which has haunted "Pitt

quarterbacks.

In the FSU game, Hogan ran for minus two yards. He
had an 18 yard and a 10 yard run, but was also caught
behind the line’ to eliminate that yardage. He completed
six of 11 passes for 59 yards. . ‘

‘Not even. DePasqua knows‘ who he-wants to start
against UCLA.

“We’ll have to do a little more thinking on that," said

the mentor. “I plan to take a closer look at both the quar- ‘

terbacks and make some decisions.” Also after an after-
noon practice at Johnstown, DePasqua made a rather

startling comment when he said, “Right now there is no

such thing as a starting quarterback.” '

A disbelieving Hogan might not have accepted that
comment then but he might vigorously be willing to buy
it now. . .

The names of Dan Lynn and Ed
Sadowski are familiar to most
Pitt football followers of recent

» years. Each of. them played many

games at offensive guard and had
brilliant careers for the Blue and
Gold. .They will be aiding Panther

efforts again this year, but in a‘

different capacity. .

' Along with John Sembiante,
Lynn and Sadowski will be serv-
ing as graduate ,assistants for
both the varsity and junior varsi-
ty teams. Because the entire
squad practices together each
day, nobody works with just the
jayvees. The three will, however,
coach the Cubs in their three
games this season:

“The jayvee team will use pri-
marily freshman,” explained
Lynn. “.But we will also use some
sophomores. Some freshman will
make the varsity traveling squad,

but only for depth. The chance to .

perform well and play for the var-
sity is in the jayvee games.”
Sadowski feels that the team
will be really fired up for its first
game, a week from Friday at
West Virginia. “Each week in
practice the freshmen are used as
cannon fodder. They pretend
they’re the upcoming opponent's
offense and defense. They’ll real-
ly be hitting in that WVU game.”

'— Sadowski and Lynn both had
some hard-hitting games when
they , were players’. The games
theyremember most were upsets
that ‘most fans recall well. Sa-
dowski talks of the 1969 homecom-
ing upset of _Syracuse, while Lynn
reminises about the ’70 West Vir-
ginia come-from-behind upset and
last year’s opener upset at UCLA.

» Lynn was a scout at last Satur-
day’s UCLA—Nebraska game -in‘
which the Bruins upset the Corn-
huskers. “That win was no fluke,”
emphasized Lynn. “They outhit

and outhustled Nebraska, and they .

-stuck it to them. Their team isn’t
as strong as ours, and they’re go-
ing to come here big headed. If
we carry the play to them, we’ll
beat them.

“This year’s team (Pitt) is bet-
ter than last year,”. he added.
“They’re better defensively and
the offense (Wishbone) needs
more time. The offense just needs
.to work out their timing. The
Florida State game really helped.”

In addition to coaching ‘the
freshmen, Lynn and Sadowski
also coach specific segments of
the varsity. Lynn helps coach the
offensive lines and pays particu-
lar attention to the centers. Sla-
dowski helps with the defensive
lines, with emphasis on the de-

fensive ends.

Joel Klimeck, last year’s tight
end, helped the team in a similar
manner at the pre-season Johns-
town training camp, but will not
be with the team during the sea-
son as he remained in Johnstown
to attend graduate school at Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh at Johns»
town (UPJ). Lynn is doing grad-
uate work here in the Economics
department.

Because of’ the uniformity of
the workouts, many areas ‘of the
junior varsity’ team are still
clouded. In addition to Sadowski,’
Lynn and Sembiante, one offen-
sive and one defensive coach will
be on loan from the varsity for
each game. ’

"Bill Quinter, last year’s fresh-
man coach, probably will be one
of them. Who will start at quar-
terback and other key positions
will be decided by Coach Carl De-
Pasqua.

"The master of moves," John Chatman, will no
longer be moving his way up a football field for the
Pitt Panthers.

The junior halfback from Washington, Pa.. has.

inflicted upon himself this exile from the grid-
iron. ‘His reason for doing so?—his desire to be-
come a collegiate wrestling champion.

 

This past season “Bimbo” Chatman was the
Eastern Intercollegiate ,Wrestling Association
(EIWA) runner-up. He is attending the University
on a wrestling scholarship. ‘

Before the beginning of fall practice (after hav-'
ing missed spring drills due to a grueling wrestling
season), Chatman decided that he would much rath-
er‘ pursue a wrestling career at Pitt.

' The grappler felt that taking time out to play
football may have hurt his chance for the EIWA

championship last year. So Chatman will be experi- __

menting this season. He will concentrate solely on_
wrestling and in this way he will be able to deter-»
mine if playing football did effect his grap perform-
ance.

Chatman’s outs‘tanq_ing moves as a halfback,
however, will certainly be missed by the Cats;

“John was a spot player for us and his absence
will hurt us in certain spots,” commented the Pan-
thers’ Offensive Coordinator ‘Bimbo Cecconi. “He
would have had a tough time starting but he would
have played a lot. John’s a good outside threat.”

' During the "71 campaign Chatman was the
third leading rusher for the Panthers with 309

‘yards, a 5.0 average, and two touchdown carries‘

He also caught eight passes for 79 yards.

He also spearheaded the offense in kickoff re-
turns with a gain of 447 yards on 16 returns ‘for a
27.9 average. ' .

 

LANCE WALL, who decided to retire from the Pitt
collegiate football scene during the last week of
summer drills has decided to rejoin the Pitt squad.

Wall played defensive back last season before

' suffering a crippling knee injury. After missing

most of last year, Wall was moved to the offense
this year to bolster the split end corps.

_ Wall maintained that the stress was to much
for his knee to stand, but has had a change of
heart. He joined the team practice Monday and will
drill all week. A

For junior fullback Paul Felinczak the 1972 Pitt football season
will be a painfully slow one. Felinczak, considered to be one of the in-
tegral cogs in the new Pitt wishbone offense.sustained a knee injury
late in August that has rendered him out of action for the entire season.

In fact, it just might take a miraculous effort on the stocky jun-
ior’s part to comeback for the 1973 campaign. But don‘t tell that to
Paul.

“I think I can come baCk,_I think I can play football again,” Felin-
czak stated. “If my knee is medically good there’s no. doubt in my mind
I can play next year.”

Felinczak injured his left knee in an Aug. 28 scrimmage. He was
running a draw play, cutting across the defense after breaking several
tackles when the injury occurred. y

“I was turning a corner to the right with all of my weight on my-left
leg when I was hit,” Felinczak said. “I had just switched to grass cleats
so when I did get him my left foot stayed planted in the ground."

Perhaps the largest obstacle in Felinczak’s path is one of a mental
block resulting from a year of inactivity on the field and watching some-
one else run at his position. That someone else is sophomore Dave
Janasek. _
* ’ Being a sophomore, Janasek must find himself in a similar spot to
the one Felinczak held last season. As a sophomore Felinczak, possess-
ed great potential but lacked the maturity and composure that can only
be obtained with experience. -

Janasek holds an edge over his injured counterpart in that he now

I has the number one fullback spot entirely to himself. Felinczak, on the

other hand, had to share his running chores as s_oph with Lou Julian,
who has since been switched to alinebacker. '

“Last year I had the ability but it was a frustrating season,” Felin-
czak remarked. “We never knew who wouldbe playing the first ‘quar-
ter, who would be playing the third or who would be in at the end of the
game.” , .-

This year Felinczak came ready to play. “Since last winter I plan-
ned to bein the bestpossible physical-shape,” he said. “I wouldn’t have
wanted them to give me rest. «

“When I come back I" know I’ll
be the number two fullback,” Paul
added. “And if‘ I get beat out for
the position, then that's just
something you have to face.”

The next year will be a long and
hard one for Felinczak, but then
again a lot of things can happen
in a year. ‘

Panther Tracks: Pitt has lost
two regulars in last Saturday’s
contest and possibly a third. De-
fensive end John Moss underwent
knee surgery on Sunday and will
be lost to the team for at least
eight weeks. Tri-captain Rick Lo-

tear in his knee and will miss the
UCLA game. .

Another offensive guard, Ernie
Webster. suffered a broken wrist
and is listed as a doubtful starter
for Saturday. \._‘

WITH THE football season already un-

  VETERANS  

DID YOU KNOW THAT
ARMY ROTC HAS SOME
SPECIAL ADVANTAGES
FOR YOU???

. . . IMMEDIATE ENROLLMENT INTO THE ADVANC-
ED COURSE: Recognizing your prior military ex-
perience you skip the first two years of ROTC.

. . . IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL AID: C.0ncu_rrent with
enrollment in ROTC, you will begin receiving a $100
per month (tax free) allowance. This is in ADDI-
TION to your monthly GI Bill payments.

. . . SCHOLARSHIP AID: Enrollment in ROTC makes
you eligible to compete for ROTC scholarships. These
scholarships pay full tuition, textbooks, student fees,

classroom materials, and other related educational ,

expenses. '

_,-

. . . FINANCIAL CREDIT FOR PRIOR SERVICE: Y o u r
prior service not only counts toward retirement but
also for pay. For example," if you have had 3 years
prior service, you would earn $10,287.00 per year

as a second lieutenant. Upon promotion to first lieu-_

tenant, after one and a half years of active duty,
this amount would increase to $12,630 per year.

. . . NEGOTIABLE ASSETS: With government sta-
tistics acknowledging the fact that the college gradu-
ate will be facing a shrinking labor market for the
next TWO DECADES, ROTC is an extremely im-
portant asset. It adds a choice to your career op-
tions. As a veteran you will-have the inside track
on a Regular Army commission, if you elect the
Army as a career. If you decide to pursue a non-
military career, it enhances your potential. For the

management, leadership, and responsibility received .

in the cruicible of ROTC and officer experience are
readily marketable. ‘

Consider the Special Advantages to you as a Veteran.
The toughest part of your service is already behind you.
Why not take advantage of it.

IT'S STILL NOT TOO LATE TO ENROLL. F-or more information contact the Professor of Military Science, Room 424,

Cathedral of Learning, telephone: 621-3500, extensions 264 -or 265.
