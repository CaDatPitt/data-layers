cannot be assumed for books;
therefore, they will not be check-

Owl Calls In
Senior Cards’

Tuesday, Jan. 18,,is the deadline
for turning in senior activity cards
for publication in the Owl, editor
Le_e Karageorge said today. Sen-
iors who have not turned in their
lists should do so at once, either
at the Owl Ofﬁce or at the Stu;
dent D_esk7~if they wish recogni- ‘
tion in the Owl. V

All seniors who have received
their proofs from the photographer
should return the selected proof
to room 821 ‘immediately, Kara-
george warns. Deadline for re-
turning proofs is Friday, Jan. 21.

Finally, all seniors who ordered
pictures must pick up their orders
in. room 821 no later than Friday,
Jan. 21. Unless they do so, it will
be necessary for them to secure
the pictures directly from the Gold
Tone studio in McKeesport, since
the photographer will -move back
to the studio after that date.

Editor Karageorge stresses that
failure on the part of any senior
to comply with the above dead-
lines will result in the ommision of
either pictures or information
from the.Owl, and in serious in-
convenience for all concerned.

CAMPUS TELE\l/ISION A

. v The introduction of television in Pittsburgh recently leads
« to some speculation as to what part the Video will occupy

in University life of the future.

Since Pittsburgh hotels, ﬁrms, and institutions have avail-
ed themselves of the facilities of VVDTV, it is hoped that
. -.Pitt..will not lag too far behind. -

I < Television would ﬁt itself nobly to many places in the
Cathedral of Learning. A
.4 First and foremost, it would be a wonderful thing if the

elevators would adopt a see-as-you-go-plan. Just think, in-
stead of staring at the back of the fellow’s head. in front of
’ you, you could watch an intgresting telecast show. .
 Another place that the translucent screeniwould prove a
,. boon is the Tuck shops. Here the food and coffee would be-
i come secondary as a gaily (if not warmly) dressed chorus
‘. cavorted across the screen. Higher prices would cause no com-
vment then. .
 History classes would be completely revolutionized. VVork-
; ;. ing on the old proverb that “A picture is worth a hundred
"f'pa.Q‘es,’; students could knock off a volume by seeing a couple
fof historical plays over television and use "the rest of'the
—._f~seinester for something else. _ ‘
A The Commons Room would have a set over each of its ﬁre-
,,places so that the gals could come in between classes and watch
 their favorite soap operas in a pleasant atmosphere.
 ' A new class, football 123 HIP, could be inaugurated to
iV7_witness Panther away games. Pre-requisites for this course
“would be attendance at three of the home games of the pre-
vious season.
Of course there are'other places in the Cathedral that
(‘would beneﬁt by the installation of Video. Places such as the
-‘Libraries and Deans’ offices. But we’ll be satisﬁed with the
'’';above mentioned spots for the present.

, Of course it would be a step. forward to have one for the
med students to watch real cutting—up_ instead of dissecting
frogs. I  - . - ’

Sense-Les  
By LES GAMLAGHER

I was walking down the street,
just yesterday as a matter of fact,
and I wasn’t feeling too bad at
all. I. was feeling good, real 200d
and then it happened. I met. Asa
O’Toole. Asa goes to the Univer-
sity here, the Bus. Ad School '60
be exact. Let me tell YOU 3 htﬂe
about Asa. The kid’s a hustler-
He’ll do anything for a buck, h0n"

est or the way you want it. I know I

for certain that in the last Stu-
dent Congress election he sold his
vote ﬁve times for a buck, twen-
ty-six a throw. '
I really envy a guy with an eye
for the fast one. Take this deal
-‘for instance. At last year’s 1\_/Ii11-
tary Ball, he had a little dinky
shop print him up 600 extra tick-
ets for the Dance which he circul-
lated’ around the school. With this
overﬂow number the Military Ball
Committee was not able to sell out
all of the legitimate ducats. Asa
bought these up at eight cents a
pound, the price for o_ld paper,
and then went down and sold
them to the late comers at the
door, with an extra jack—up of
seventy-ﬁve cents added to the
original cost. This was the rea-
son for the sweaty, crowded con-
dition of last year’s function.

Hof Dogs and Tea—Ugh.'
One of Asa’s smoother deals
centers around the time, that he

foxed the Forbes Field conces-

sionaire, Myron O’Brisky. Asa saw
the chance to make some coin of
the realm and when he mapped
the plan for Myron, the deal was
closed. It seems that for an un-
disclosed sum Asa sold Myron
the hot-dog franchise for the
Chancellor’s Teas. The idea-work-‘
ed once but the heads of our in-
stitution, although agreeing that
the hot-dog and the tea made a
delightful as well as nourishing
repast, did not feel that the hot-
do-g lent itself to the dignity of a
faculty function and rather than
have the thing grow into a cere-
mony of traditional signiﬁcance
deemed it advisable to discontinue
the hot-dog. Myron took the order
like the true sportsman he is, and
strode quietly but unbowed to-
ward the Field across Forbes.
‘Another fairly slick maneuver
occured when Asa first came to
the University, back in 1946, dur-
ing the halycon days of the ‘over-
ﬂow of restless, non-adjusted vet
students.
kill the boring time between the
boring classes- for the men to
whom We owed- so much. He hir-
ed aburlesque queen and swept
out the unﬁnished 39th ﬂoor as a
theater. The admission was stiff
but the entertainment promising
and the performance continuous.

Frifzed by Dean

He was well on his way to his
ﬁrst million when the show fold-
ed because of the_intenvention of
the dean of women. ,She said,
“that is was‘ undermining the
morals of all decent women here
at the University.” Asa swears
that there never was a co-ed‘ at

' any of the performances. The dean

of men’s office remained suspici-
ously quiet on the whole affair.

When Asa lost out in the enter-
tainment world he switched his
talents to labor and management:
It was through Asa that the lab-
orers here for Buildings and
Grounds were unionized. Because
dandelion—pickers and
Snow-shoveller Local 804 re-
ceived a four cent an hour in-
crease over previous working con-
ditions plus an awarding of a
bronze plaque for high: picker.
They also were guaranteed an as-
senting or dissenting vote in the
choice of Commons Room organ-
ist. As leader and organizer Asa
was rewarded.

But as I was saying at the be-
ginning I was feeling good but
my mood changed with my chance
meeting with'Asa. I always feel
lousy when I see a guy with more
than I have. Not that I’m jealous
mind you, I just feel bad. But on
the other hand no matter how
much the other guy has, don“: feel
bad like I do. Maybe he’s hand-
somer, better personality, nicer
clothes, but if you scout around
there’s probably something where
you go him one better, even if its
only something as abstract as one

time you had a better thought. ,

Asa devised a plan to '

It all started out with me

to get into the registration area
in the Commons Room.

But why worry, says I? By
some miracle this idea of pre-
registration has been conceived
by the Registrar’s ofﬁce-—just to
make things easy for struggling
college students like me.

So I take off for the Commons
Room to pick up a_ few English
cards. After standing in line for
a minute or two, I ﬁnd myself
staring into the face .of a smiling
young lady who asks if she can
help me.

I glance down at my study list

“Could I take Geography 50 with’-

back.

“Why, of course you may take
it if you’re really interested in

One more stop, I think, and I’m
done. So I hop on an elevator
and head for the 29th ﬂoor and
the history ofﬁce. I ask the girl
there for some conﬁdential in-

Video Finds Way toCampus‘
With Students As Performers

By PEGGY EVANS ,
Bob Prince, the sportscaster
who added to baseball lingo such
lines as “right down Broadway,”
without permission from either
fans or players, used this kind of
originality in his introduction of
television to the University, last
Monday. Prince, with the help of
a few students, presented the ﬁrst
video show at Pitt from a mobile
unit belonging to the Beacon Tele-
vision Company. of Pittsburgh.
The unit which was moved to
the corner of Forbes Street and
Bigelow Boulevard about 1 p. m.
brought to campus the outstand-
ing Dr. Thomas Goldsmith, direc-
tor of research for DuMont labo-
ratories; Herbert Farrell, junior
engineer, and Robert Wakeman,
All of the men
are employed by the DuMont
Company, in New Jersey, and
were in Pittsburgh prior to the
formal opening of Pittsburgh’s
initial television station, WDTV,

' at Syria Mosque, Tuesday, evening.

The telescope, located on top of
the unit, succeeded in catching
within its lens, the pictures of

. many unsuspecting students who

were leaving and entering the Ca-
thedral; their pictures ﬂashed on
the screen built into the side of
the t-ruck, and Prince, at the PA
mike, added the script. 3

Co-eds Shirley Taper and Esther
Jacobson smiled and refused to
answer Prince’s question, “Say
now, they are . . . but who are
you?” Mary Lou Crockett, comely
brunette and soft-spoken speech
major, won approval from both
Prince and students. The very
photoghenic Mary Lou won a hand

of applause from the predominant-_

ly male onlookers when she smiled
into the camera, and a still louder
one when she answered the
emcee’s question, “Do you have a
boyfriend?” Said Mary Lou, “I’m
married.”

Bob Giza, School of Education,
who came "in at the beginning of
the unrehearsed show, wandered
through the crowd, and frequently
appeared ‘on the screen. Prince,
seeking variety in the reel, pushed
Officer Dailey, from the Oakland
station, in front of the camera.
The “law” really took over all of
the screen in a closeup that
brought this remark from Prince,

Fulbright Act Pays Students
For Graduate Study Abroad

Under the Fulbright Act, Pitt students may now go abroad for
graduate study, teaching, or research. "

The'act provides transportation to and from the United States
as long as it may be paid in the currency of the country where
the student desires to attend school.

There are no American dollars available under the act. Main-
tenance, tuition and incidental expenses are paid in the currency

ofthe country.
Other nations wished to buy the
surplus property which the United

States shipped abroad during the

war but could not ﬁnd enough
American dollars to do so. ’

A The act authorizes the Secre-
tary of State to negotiate agree-
ments to use foreign currencies
realized through such surplus-
property sales for sending Amer-
icans abroad.-

While the Board of Foreign
Scholarships is responsible for the
selection of participants, a,‘ local
board of faculty members, Grad-
uate Council, will review all Pitt
applications.’ '

“In connection with student ap-
plicationsunder the Fulbright pro-
gram and other nationally com-
petitive fellowship programs, the
Graduate Council will serve as a
local reviewing board for all ap-
plications from Pitt students,”
Dean Longneckerof the Graduate
School said. ,

Veterans of World .War I and II
will -be given preference provided
their qualiﬁcations equal those of
other candidates. Some knowl-
edge of the language of the coun-
try is helpful but not necessary.

Johns Hopkins, and Kansas City
Universities and the Universityof
Pennsylvania.

More than 200 research publica-
tions have been published by Dr.
Bompiani, 25 of which have ap-
peared within the last ﬁve years.

The professor received his doc-
torate from the University of
Rome in 1910. After professor-
ships at the Institute of Tech-
nology in Milan later at the'Uni-
versity of Bologna, he assumed a
full professorship at the Univer-
sity of Rome in 1927.

During the ﬁrst World War he
had distinguished himself in the
ﬁeld of aeronautical engineering.
His degree in this capacity came
from the Ecole Superieur d’Aero-
nautique in Paris. 6‘

Fellowships to Open

I

“Here you can see the law in ac-
tion.”

A professor unaware of his part
in the success of the show walked
slowly up the walk to the lower
entrance and only once looked to-
ward the group without venturing
as much as a smile.

A Pitt News writer in a hurry
to catch a streetcar changed her
mind and crossed thelawn to join

the _group. From the loudspeaker _
came the repeated line, “She’s,

really walking on eggs-” The lawn
,was -muddy and walking a bit
_tedious. An umbrella clouded her
face, but a skirt that had belonged

to the pre-new look era, did noth- ‘

ing to cloud her legs. So sandals,
bobby sox, and legs not meant for
pictures, made the television pre-
miere at Pitt.

The show was short, but every-,;, ,, A A

one had a good time, including
Prince who got in some practice
for the kind of work he plansto
do in the future. He is under con-
tract, now, for televised shows.

Not to be completely amateur,
Prince closed the show by raising
it to the profesisonal level, when
he featured a professional in the
group. As the cameraman reeled
through group pictures of the
crowd at large, he saw a familiar
face. Prince gave the commercial
for his announcer friend, ‘and
Pitt’s Vince Joyce came ‘to the
screen. “It’s Vince Joyce, WWSW
announcer]; Prince told the stu-
dents. ‘

With that, Pitt’s ﬁrst television

show became history. ‘ ‘

Heart llop Key
To Date Future
Of Lucky Lads

“Love, love, love” is the theme
song of the Pitt coeds as “Twit-
terpation,” better known as Heart
Hop, beats into view Friday, Feb.
18, in the Urban Room of the Wil-
liam Penn Hotel.

Highlights of this year’s hop
are Bill LeRoy and his famous
orchestra coupled with current
talent from some of Pittsburgh’s
leading night clubs.

Decorations, in keeping with
the Disney theme, will feature
little animals pasted on the walls
and perhaps a few real animals
for an extra surprise.

Naturally the main ~ idea of
Heart Hop is that the girl does
the inviting. As Shirley Levine,
publicity chairman says, “If you
take a date to Heart Hop, Feb.
18, he might take you to the Mili-
tary Ball, March 18.”

“Twitterpation” ﬁrst hit civili-
zation in Walt Disney’s fantasy
“Bambi.” The committee for the
Twitter Hop include: Dorothy
T Smith, chairman; Peggy Antoone,

business manager; Shirley Levine,
publicity; Dorothy Clemens, pro-
gram, and Jean Dobrosielski, dec-
orations.
Tickets at $3.25, tax. included,
" are available at the student desk.
Only a limited number of 300
, tickets are available, so the ‘com-
mittee urges early purchases.

Military Ball to Offer
Music by Tex Beneke  

“Moonlight Serenade,” Glenn Miller’s theme song will stir up
many old memories March 18 when Tex Beneke comes to town
for the Military Ball.

Older students and young alike remember the Miller music
of pre-war days. Little Brown Jug, Tuxedo Junction and Chata-
nooga Choo Choo—just to name a few—swept the country time
and time again. - ’

Tex Beneke has the same band and plays the same style of
smooth, danceable music plus jump tunes for the jitterbugs. The
band’s only change is the vocal group which in Miller’s time were
the Modernaires with Paula Kelly. '

The new group, called the‘
Moonlight Serenaders, joined Ben-
eke last year. The Serenaders

are noted for their smooth style
and their two female singers.

This year’s Military Ball will be
held at West View Danceland, a
break from tradition as far as the
“Military” is concerned. The Ball
will be the ﬁrst formal dance that
Pitt has held at West View. The
dance ﬂoor at West View is slight-
ly larger than the three ball rooms
that have been used in the last‘
few years at the William Penn
Hotel.

This year, as in the past, the
dance will be formal but uniforms
may be worn in place of the boiled
collar and black tie. ROTC stu-
dents are requested to wear their
uniforms, but this is not man-
datory. Veterans with bars, fruit-
salad, and stripes who can still ﬁt
into their O.Dv.’s, greens or blues,
are welcome to wear them, the

Manko-Hilldorter Duel Marks
Tankers‘ Edinboro Meeting

, 9 By WILL DOERGE _

Pitt ﬁgures to continue its winning streak, which has lasted since
1947, against the Edinboro swimmers tonight, but Panther back-
;troker Bill Manko lays his record of eleven straight dual-meet vic-
;ories on the line against the home team’s ace, Joe Hilldorfer.

_The Manko-Hilldorfer 150-yard duel features the meet which
Jtherwise looks like a-one—sided Pitt win. It may easily develop into
1 clean sweep for Ben Grady’s natators.

yAlthough tonight’s backstroke:
ivals swam different distances in _
ompetition last week, a glance at
he times they turned in promises
. close race. Pitt’s 32-year-old
‘e-‘teran swam the regulation 150
ards in 1:51.8, while Hilldorfer
.id_140 yards in 1:42.7, a school
ecord.

A third extended winning
treak, Dick Petro’s undefeated
ollege record, also goes on the
lock tonight at Edinboro, but
ased on his Allegheny perform-
nce, the Uniontown sophomore
hould. remain unbeaten.

Against the Gators, Dick swam
rue to form_ in cracking another
ecord, a pool mark in the 60-
ard free—style event in 30.9 sec-
nds. '

Hilldorfer, a Perry High prod-
ct, spearheads both relay teams
ie aided in setting two other
chool recor_ds as Edinboro
lowned Westminster, 38-37. With-
ut a doubt, the freshman

phenom is Mr. Swim at Edinboro.

Stiff opposition may be offered
Grady’s relay teams, for Edinboro
posted respectable times against
the Titans that compared favor-
ably with Pitt’s. One-tenth of a
second gives the Panther 400-
yard free-style relay squad a
slight edge, while on the surface,
their medley crew rates behind
the home team’s.

However, in the Allegheny
meet, the Pitt medley trio only
lost due to a missed turn by one
of the boys. They had a sub-
stantial lead at the time. and
otherwise would have won easily.

Tonight, Grady believes, they
will redeem themselves and upset
the Hilldorfer-led squad. Manko
swims backstroke, Bob McHale,
breaststroke, and Walt Jackson,
free-style.

Diving will be added this week,
with Bill Cochran and Howard
Sadowsky on hand to head the
Panther contingent.

01a, and U. C. L. A.

Stanford and U. C. L. A. are
presently two of the West’s fore-
most basketball strongholds. Stan-
ford, for example, can exclusive-
ly boast about its feat of hand-
cufﬁng Yale’s Tony Lavelli,
boomed as the best one-handed
shot in the nation.

On the way home the Panthers
will stop off at Tucson to play
Arizona University. The Wild-
cats, in a recent invasion of the
Tri-State district, lost to Du-
quesne by six points and West
Virginia by three.

The Pitts will no doubt enjoy
such sights as the Grand Canyon
and other culture that comes with
travel. But they will have to go
hard to keep their record of losses
from rising to an equilibrium
with their wins.

West Pointe 

rs 42-35

Before departing on an extended
Western trip,‘ Carlson’s basketball
caravan took a preparatory sally
east and outmanuevered Army,
42-35, Wednesday afternoon. 
The Panthers waited until the
second half before moving into
the lead, as Doc Carlson started
his sophomore reserves. Sammy
David and Mike Belich chipped
in three two-pointers apiece for
the Pitts who caught the West
Point ﬁve and went ahead late in
the third quarter.

David and his tally twin, Dodo
Canterna, were the top point-
makers in the tightly-played con-
test that saw the Pittsburghers
add their sixth straight verdict
and eighth in eleven starts.

The Bridgeville sharpshooter re-
gained the city scoring lead, his
18 points against Army upping his
total to 167. Tech’s Mike Theodore
was held to 10 by W & J Wednes-
day evening. Canterna remained
third as he matched Theodore’s
production.

.i'Wl1y?' Challenge From Slar
Spurs Tracker Ted Zatkovich

By BOB LEVIS , l
, A dejected Pitt cross country runner got a one-word re-
fresher recently to spur his drills for next year’s season. I
Ted Zatkovich, Panther harrier who wa.s selected by Carl
Olson for the annual NCAA meet at Lansing, Michigan. was

disconsolately eating his supper after ﬁnishing a poor 102nd

«in the ,race. . ’

At the same table, the Winner, Bob Black of Rhode Island

,5tate University, was enjoying thefand didnﬂc build up my conﬁdence

meal as only a winner can. Al-
W ‘ hough disappointed, the lanky
Pitt athlete congratulateduthe New
Englander on his brilliant victory
that afternoon.
 ,Bl'ack then asked‘Ted in what
‘place, he ﬁnished in the race that
day. “One hundred and second”
was the reply.
~ “You know what he asked me?”
exclaimed Ted later. All he said
was “Why?” ’ ‘
it But the ordinarily-shy Pitt run-
her. remarked that Black’s “why?”
has weighed heavily on his mind
 has led him to a number of
? conclusions.
1 “In the ﬁrst place, I intend to
"burn up the track next fall. I
’ lot a late start this past season

until‘ the ﬁnal two meets on the
Pitt schedule.” Ted ran in the
number one position in these
meets, and proved to Coach Olson
that the NCAA wouldn’t be too
tough for him.

When asked what he thought

of Black, Zatkovich replied, “He’s
a young fellow with plenty of guts
and a lot of nerve.” <

“He won the NCAA plus‘ the
IC4A, and his timing and stride
are beautiful things to watch.
Trouble was, I watched it from
too far back.”

It is too soon to predict what
Ted will do next year, but it is
hard to foresee,failure for a run-
ner who has as much determina-
tion as Ted Zatkovich.

Today, new organic insecticides
andfungicides help control insects,
plant diseases and blights that threat- '

tectants help guarantee bountiful
harvests by protecting crops in the
critical period after planting. Plant
hormones hold fruit on trees until
fully ready for picking.

Days of labor saved

DuPont weed killers and explosives
accomplish in minutes tasks that
used to take hours or days of back-
breaking labor. With 2,4-D farmers
can kill weedswithout harming cer-
tain- crops. Dynamite removes
stumps, digs ditches for draining and
irrigation, and loosens the soil to
forestall erosion.

New fertilizer formulations meet
the changing nutritional require-

season. Thus the farmer has better
control over crop development, and
he can utilize his materials, labor and

A substantial ﬁnancial gift

from Mrs. Clifford Heinz,.long

it possible to purchase electric stoves, refrigerators, freezing units,

The kitchen, a casualty of the’

is not designed to rival the Tuck
Shop. It will provide various

clubs and groups throughout the
University with a scheduled place
to meet and serve dinners and
light refreshments. “We hope to
have it in.operation by next fall,”
Miss Rush reports.

Miss Ruth L. Cramblet, director
of University Food Service, and
Miss Savina S. Skewis, assistant
director, designed the kitchen to
fulﬁll the needs of student groups,
