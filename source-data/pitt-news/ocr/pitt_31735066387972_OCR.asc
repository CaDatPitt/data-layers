PSfP asks Posvar to elimi

By Renee Crespy
Sta_[f Writer

Pittsburgh Students for Peace
asked Pitt President Wesley
Posvar to eliminate armed-
services recruitment from campus,
suspend ROTC recruitment,
eliminate ROTC programs and
not accept any new contracts
with the Department of Defense.

About 75 members of PSfP
entered Posvar’s office last
Thursday afternoon to hand-
deliver a letter that asked Posvar
to give equal attention to groups
for and against the war.

The letter said the University of
Pittsburgh aids and abets the “war
machine” while paying only lip
service to peace issues. In order
to uphold its integrity as a
democratic educational
institution, the university must
make a choice: either eliminate
its complicity with war efforts or
affirm fairness and diversity,
according to the letter.

Posvar was asked to either
comply with the demands
concerning the ROTC or to found

an officially recognized, promoted
and funded department of peace
and justice studies. That
department should have equal
status with other departments and
areas ofstudy, according to PSfP.

Posvar was not available for
comment, and Nancy White, Pos-
var’s assistant, refused comment.

After delivering the letter to
Posvar, the group went to
Carnegie Mellon, where they were
joined by other students
supporting peace. Several people
spoke, including Sanford Kelter,
an organizer for Veterans for
Peace.

Kelter said his organization had
been denied the right to meet at
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall
because of its views on the Persian
Gulf war.

“Through our services, we have
learned about the horrors of war,
and we should stop the war now,"
Kelter said.

Kelter ended his speech with a
quote by President Eisenhower:
“If our leaders don’t bring peace,
the people will rise up and
demand it."

Carnpus Store owner
alleges judge unfair
in Vendor's court case

Your Campus Store owner Tom Sabol has alleged that the
recent court reprieve granted to an Oakland clothing vendor
was unfairly handled by the judge presiding over the case.

“I could have picked up someone off of the street who could
have handled [the hearing] better,” said Sabol.

Charles Bonasorte, owner of The Pittsburgh Stop, an outside
vending operation located on Forb"es Avenue and Bigelow
Boulevard, received the reprieve, which said the revocation of
his vendor's license last year was illegal. Bonasone had been
the subject of complaints for the past year from the city of
Pittsburgh, the university and Sabol.

Sabol alleged that Bonasorte’s violations, such as illegal
parking of his trucks and the placement of his carts, have
repeatedly been ignored by the city of Pittsburgh, and that laws
have been constructed exclusively for Bonasorte’s benefit.

“lBonasortel is at the corner eight to 10 hours a day,” said
Sabol. “The laws were passed for him. [The city] has no right to
give what is public domain to one person," he added.

According to Sabol, Robert A. Doyle, the judge presiding over
Bonasorte’s case, failed to hear testimony from witnesses

. present at the hearing, and turned what was supposedly an

issue concerning city ordinance violations into a discussion
about T -shirts.

Sabol said Doyle's remarks about the case were often
sarcastic when Doyle responded to testimony by Commonwealth
attorney Howard Schulberg. After Schulberg’s statement that
Bonasorte had failed to move his carts the allotted distance
required by the city ordinance, Doyle said, “Well, the law must
be enforced. We’ve got to be sure of that. Imagine there’s a real
crime here —— selling T-shirts.”

“I don't think there was a hearing at all,” said Sabol. “[Doylel
asked no questions about the case at hand. He gabbed on about
something totally irrelevant.

The College of General Studies Student
Government Council's decision to support faculty
unionization at Pitt is uninformed and does not
represent the views of the CGS student body,
according to Student Government Board President
Brent ‘Saunders.

Saunders explained his view at Wednesday's
SGB meeting.

Saunders asked the CGS council how it arrived at
its decision to support unionization. Saunders had
done extensive research before issuing the SGB
statement against a possible union. Saunders said
he was disappointed because the council meeting
Wednesday consisted of only three CGS board

members and the adviser.

‘I pursued to question what research they had
done or what information they had that maybe [the
SGB] didn't have, and it turned out that [the
statement] was just the opinion of the two or three
people there,‘ Saunders said. ‘They had done no
research or at least no research that they would tell
me about.‘

Saunders said the council's statement was
unprofessional because it did not effectively
represent its constituency.

The CGS Student Government Council was
unavailable for comment.

In other business, Saunders said the SGB will
work with the Black Action Society concerning its
statement that the BAS will no longer recommend
Pitt for black students.

There is a consensus among
the people of Israel to stay out of
the war, according to Aaron
Kirschenbaum, professor of law
and chairman of the department
of law at Tel Aviv University.

Kirschenbaum spoke on
Thursday at the Pitt School of
Law School on “The Ethics of
Rabbinic Penology: Questions
Related to Criminal Law.”

At a press conference after the
speech, Kirschenbaum answered
questions about the war and its
effects on Israel. He said Israel
will not retaliate against Iraq
because Israelis “don’t want to
rock the coalition boat.”

He said he does not think that
Israel will get involved in the war
because “America is doing a much

_ better job of defeating Iraq than

Israel would." But he said he

does not know what would
happen if Israel were attacked
with chemical weapons.

Kirschenbaum said
comparisons between Iraq's
occupation of Kuwait and the
Israeli occupation of the West
Bank is absurd because they are
two totally different things. Israel
was attacked by Egypt, Syria and
Jordan, and as a result took over
the West Bank, Kirschenbaum
said. Kuwait was attacked by Iraq
and could not do anything about
it, he added. Kirschenbaum said
that Israel has the right to occupy
the West Bank, because it was
attacked first.

“The connection between the
two is a moral fallacy,” he said.

It is questionable whether the
Palestinians in the occupied areas
are the enemy, Kirschenbaum
said. Consequently, there is a
debate about giving Palestinians
gas masks if there is a chemical

attack. If Palestinians are the
enemy, gas masks should not be
given to them, said

Kirschenbaum. Israel often uses ‘

tear gas to break up riots in the
West Bank, and if the Palestinians
have gas masks, Israelis will not
be able to break up the riots.
Israel is divided on this issue,
Kirschenbaum said.

Kirschenbaum said that the trust
between the Palestinians and the
Israelis disappeared when Iraq
invaded Kuwait.

Kirschenbaum is an expert on
Jewish law. He was born in the
United States and lived in New
York until 1969, when he left to
teach in Tel Aviv. He has lived in
Israel for 21 years. His visit was
made possible by the Burns
Endowment on Ethics in
cooperation with the International
Center of B’nai B’rith Hillel.

Students who missed last
semester's performance of A Me of
the Mind have an opportunity to
see it Friday in Albany, N.Y.

Pitt’s production of A Lie of the
Mind was one of five shows
chosen in November by judges
from Penn State University and
Indiana University ofPennsylvania
to compete at Albany University
on March 1. The winner will then
go on to perform in Washington,
D.C., at the end of April.

The University of Pittsburgh
was one of 109 colleges to
compete in the American College
Theater Festival. Colleges from
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New
York, Delaware, Maryland and
the District of Columbia all

competed.
The shows were judged on
costumes, acting, technical

aspects, such as lighting and
sound, and set design.

“lt’s great to do the show again,"
said Susan Kane, stage manager.
“We’re rebuilding and fixing our
mistakes." Kane said she enjoys

working with the cast. "Everyone
works really well together. It’s a
well—rounded group, like a
family," she said.

Lie cast members Steven
Anderson, Dave Drayer and
Patricia Miles were nominated
for the Irene Ryan acting award.

Anderson, who is in his third
year of the master's of fine arts
program, said it was an honor for
the cast to go to New York.

“This makes people realize that
Pitt has a theater department,” he
said.

Hearing people need to understand that

Walkney, who teaches sign language,
helped organize the eighth annual Deaf
Awareness Fair on Friday. The fair was
sponsored by the Deaf Awareness and Sign
Connection clubs.

important because it provides the deaf
community with information about services
and products available to them.

Walkney said the fair is also important to
the hearing community because it helps
dismiss myths and misunderstandings about
deaf people.

Over 25 local and national companies and
organizations, as well as several speakers and
performing groups, attended the fair.

The guest speakers were Sandy Duncan,
director ofthe Office ofI.abor and Industry of

Pennsylvania; Robert I.apc, who defended
Joanna De Long, who was denied the
opportunity to serve on a jury because she is
deaf; and Mitch Travers ofGallaudet University
for the speech- and hearing-impaired.

The Pirate Parrot also made a special
appearance.

Some of the speakers signed their remarks,

‘ Au pair opportunity

to learn, save money

By George Kopec
For T be P!!! News

A student can experience cross-
cultural learning and reduce the
cost of a trip to Europe by
becoming an au pair, according
to Linda Greenberg, program
manager of the Au Pair/lilomestay

s Abroad Program.

An open house held in the
study 4 abroad resource center
Friday featured various
opportunities for students to go
abroad. Greenberg said students
can experience cross-cultural
learning in a family setting by
becoming an au pair.

An au pair stays with a family in
a European country for three to
12 months.

Greenberg said the goal of the
homestay concept is “building

‘international friendship on a

personal level as the foundation
for building understanding on a
world level."

The program started in 1988
and sent students to France. lt
expanded this year to give
students a choice between France,
Belgium, Germany, Great Britain,
Greece, Italy and Spain.

The fee for the program is
$1,200 to $1,400, but this cost is
significantly defrayed by the
average monthly stipend of$30(),
which students receive by

_§ providing 25 to 30 hours per

week of child care.

Au pairs are also required to be
enrolled in at least one course
during their stay. Depending on
the country they go to, some
basic foreign-language
competence may also be required.

Pitt freshman Alexandra Baskin
took a year off between high
school and college to participate
in the au pair program. She stayed
with a family in Paris and helped
to take care of their three children,
a 3-year-old girl and 2-year-old
twins.

Baskin said that since the young
children were also learning
French themselves, “we learned
from each other. Sometimes the
kids would pick up things wrong
from me, and sometimes I would
learn things wrong from them.
But the parents helped out when
they heard us making mistakes
with the language.”

Baskin and other au pairs were
required by the French gov-
ernment to take a course about
French culture. She made friends
with au pairs from all over liu rope.

But Baskin said she learned
much more living as a member of
a family than she could have ever
learned in a classroom. “lt’s a
really good way to go abroad and
get into the culture.”

For more information on
becoming an au pair, call Linda
Greenberg at (412) 422-3202, or
stop in the study abroad office
located in 4G Forbes Quadrangle.

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Mondav. February 25, 1991

 

For T be Pin News

At age 24, Pitt student Mark
Shenkan has already had a taste
of success.

Shenkan is the man behind the
Collegiate Express Connection.
The service provides trans-
portation home for the holidays
for students who live in Penn-
sylvania, New York and New
Jersey.

Shenkan became involved in
the travel industry in 1988 when
he had tickets to the Pitt-Penn

State game at Penn State. He
realized that he and many other
students had no means of
transportation to Penn State. He
put together a round-trip bus ride
for the event.

The success of the Pitt—Penn
State bus trip sparked his interest
in the travel industry. He began
doing research on the feasibility
ofa bus service running from Pitt
to Ross Park and Century III malls.
Although Century III showed
interest, it lacked the funds to
establish the service.

This setback only made

Shenkan work harder to find a
bus service that would work.
That's when he came up with the
idea of a bus service to transport
students home for the holidays.
Shenkan began to put his ideas
into action during his junior year.
He began a business called
Panther Travel Service which was
exclusively for Pitt students.
Shenkan felt he had an edge over
his competitors because his bus
trips were more fun. He provided
riders with complimentary Coca-
Cola products and newspapers

and tried to lease buses with.

video monitors.

This fall, Shenkan started his
senior year as owner and travel
director of Collegiate Express
Connection. I-Ie changed the
name and expanded the service
to all students in the Pittsburgh
area.

Shenkan said his goal is to
“make student travel fun and
entertaining." Today, most of his
bus trips offer complimentary

Pitt senior achieves success in business world

By Megan Bertino

Shenkan is unsure about his
future after her graduates this
spring. He is considering graduate
school, but he wants to work on
expanding his business to more
schools on the East coast and
some in the Midwest.

He said this summer is a good
time to expand because he will
have the time and what he calls
“the right spices to make a healthy
business.”

If Collegiate Express Conn-
ection does not stay in operation,
Shenkan intends to stay in the
travel and promotion industry.

University unsure of how it will deal with new diplomas

By Megan Bertino

For the Pill News

The university's office of admissions is
uncertain as to how it will react to the new
diploma the American Council on
Education has devised for people who did
not graduate from high school.

The new External Diploma Program
tests a person's competencies rather than
academic skills, according to Nancy Musick
from the American Council on Education.

Until now, there has been no alternative
for people who did not graduate from

high school other than the General
Education Diploma. According to john
Bolvin, dean of the College of General
Studies, the university does not have
enough information on the new program
to make a decision as to whether or not
applicants with an external diploma will
be accepted.

The focus of the program will be adults
35 years of age and older. Musick said the
American Council on Education said many
adults have acquired knowledge through
life experiences that qualifies them for a
diploma.

Unlike the GED, the external program
will be run by school districts, not the
state. Individuals will work out a personal
plan of study with an adviser rather than
attend structured classes.

The program works in two phases,
according to Musick. The first tests the
student’s diagnostic skills. If a student
requires additional training in remedial
skills such as reading, comprehension or
computation, the student will be referred
to an adult- learning center in the
community.

If the student does not need or has

already completed remedial training, the
second phase begins. This phase is an
assessment of 6/1 generalized competencies
in the areas of communication, comp-
utation, occupational preparedness and
self, social, consumer and scientific aware-
ness. The student must also demonstrate
one individual competency in an academic,
occupational or special talent area.

Once a student has demonstrated
competency in these areas, he or she is
awarded a high-school diploma.

The new diploma will not be replacing
the GED.

‘The judge was a joker. He was
playing to the audience, trying to
get laughs. He is not down there
to be funny,” Sabol added.

Sabol said the case is a serious
one, since it is on appeal, and the
judge's handling ofthe case was
incorrect.

“I don’t know if it was
deliberate, but lDoylel didn’teven

examine the case,” said Sabol.
“No one there could make a
good statement [against
Bonasorte] because lDoyle| kept
cutting everyone off at the pass.”

Sabol said the judge had no
basis to make a decision because
not enough testimony was heard.

“I don’t know if the decision
was fair because I don't think
[Doyle] ever heard a case,‘ said

Sabol.

Sabol added that Bonasorte has
received an advantage from City
Council because Bonasorte can
continue vending on the corner
of Forbes Avenue and Bigelow
Boulevard.

“Why does [Bonasorte] get the
corner?” said Sabol. “What gives
him all the rights? He doesn’t
comply with anything [Bonasorte]
is distorting the law, and he is
being helped,” said Sabol.

‘Members of council treated

[Bonasorte] like a king," said Sabol

In response to Sabol’s
accusation that the city is
providing Bonasorte with a
privilege, Bonasorte said that the
city has passed the ordinances,
and he is in compliance with all
of them.

Bonasorte said that Sabol has
no basis for complaint, since the
city ordinance states that a vendor
must be situated 500 feet from a
business, and he is in compliance
with the statute.

“I am locateJ 1800 feet from
[Your Campus Store], and that’s
much farther than the distance
required by the ordinance,‘ said
Bonasorte.

‘The city has given me the right
to be a vendor, and that’s just
what I'm rloing. Sabol won't leave
me alone,” he added.

Bonasorte said that he has not
received any special treatment
from City Council and that he has
had to change much of his

According to Bonasorte, there
was no need for his lawyer to
cross-examine in the case because
the issues were cut and dried.

‘I've received 10 tickets and 10
not guilties,' said Bonasorte.
'lDoylel saw through the political
bureaucracy that the city was
putting me through. The city had
zero evidence to revoke my
license, and the judge knew it,”
he added.

Sabol said Bonasorte’s vending
operation is cluttering the corner
of Forbes Avenue and Bigelow
Boulevard, causing a hazard to
pedestrians.

‘That's one of the busiest
corners in Pittsbu rgh,” said Sabol.
“Why should public land be
congested? A sidewalk is a place
for walking, not for a store.

“Council has given him a place
to stay, and I don’t think that’s
right,” said Sabol.

“Everything he has asked for
has gone through. I think it’s a
law just for Bonasorte,” added
Sabol.

Sabol said that he will also
capitalize on the use of the corner
of Forbes Avenue and Bigelow
Boulevard and will move down
there himself as a vendor.

“That's fine with me,” , said
Bonasorte.

Pipe dream 

Orange Win deals severe blow to Pitt's

By Rob Mazur-
Sla_[]' Writer

SYRACUSE, N.Y. —— Pitt entered yesterday's game against the
Syracuse Orangemen looking to move into a tie for first place in
the Big East Conference and put one more in their win column
in the process. But the only "1 ' the Panthers left the Carrier Dome
with, however, was in the scoring and rebounding columns of
starting center Bobby Martin.

The 89-68 loss in front of the third-largest crowd for a Syracuse
home game (32,763) ended the Panthers’ two-game winning
streak and dropped their record to 19-9 overall, 8-6 in the Big East.

In the process, Pitt's hopes of winning the Big East title outright
vanished.

The Orangemen dominated nearly every aspect of the game.
They had more rebounds, assists and blocks —— not to mention
points. The Syracuse frontcourt of Billy Owens, David Johnson,
LeRon Ellis and Conrad McRae toasted the Panthers, combining
for 73 points, 40 rebounds, 14 assists and nine blocks.

The entire Pitt frontcourt of Martin, Brian Shorter, Darren
Morningstar, Chris McNeal and Antoine Jones combined for a
whopping 38 points. Owens had 33 points and was named Player
of the Game by CBS.

Owens ended the day with 16 rebounds and eight assists to go
with his 33 points. He shot 13 of 20 from the field, including two
for two from three-point land and five for five from the foul line.

“He is a great player," said Syracuse Coach Jim Bocheim. “He's
playing at his best position [power forwardl. You can't stop him
after he gets the ball down low. Not many players can do what
he can.” V

Not to be overshadowed, Ellis chipped in 19 points, eight above
his season average. Johnson contributed 12 points, and McRae
added nine, going four for four from the floor.

The Orangemen also cleaned up on the glass at both ends, out-
rebounding the ground-bound Panthers 49-33. Owens had 16,
and Ellis had 13.

Syracuse controlled the opening tip and never looked back,
going on a 19-5 run to start the game. Pitt led only once, 2-1. The
initial Syracuse run was aided by an Antoine Jones goaltending
violation and an intentional foul by Darren Morningstar, as he and
Michael Edwards were involved in a scuffle on the floor.

"I thought that was a bad call,‘ said Morningstar. ‘Edwards and
I were both rolling around on the floor going after the ball. We

Ellis and Owens slam the door on bapless Panthers

By Jim Tezak
News Editor

SYRACUSE N.Y.—Pitt was double-
teamed in the Carrier Dome on Sunday
—— literally. Forward Billy Owens and
center LeRon Ellis combined for 52
points and 29 rebounds and shut down
the Panthers’ inside game to power
Syracuse to an 8968 victory. Owens
also added eight assists.

“lOwensl has been a leader for us
since the beginning of the year. His

value is obvious in the statistics he gets,
but he knows what it takes to win, and
he'll do whatever it takes,’ said Syracuse
Coach Jim Boeheim. ‘We have to run a lot
of our offense through him; yet, he's still
our best rebounder."

Owens and Ellis scored 20 of the
Orangemen’s first 29 points, as Syracuse
jumped out to a 29-16 lead. Brian Shorter
and Antoine Jones combined for the
Panthers’ first 13 points during thatstretch,
but it wasn’t enough to keep Pitt close.

Along with freshman forward Conrad

McRae who scored nine points, seven
rebounds and two blocks, Owens and
Ellis dominated both ends of the court.

Ellis set the tone defensively for the
Orangemen in the first half. When Pitt's
Darren Morningstar went up for what
looked to be an easy two-handed slam,
Ellis knocked him to the floor hard and
then raised his hands, whipping the Carrier
Dome fans into a frenzy.

Pitt's starting center, Bobby Martin,
played only 12 minutes and was held to
one point and one rebound. “Bobby was

a little better the first time around,” Pitt
Coach Paul Evans said. Martin didn't
play in the Panthers’ first game against
Syracuse because of a finger injury.

Owens and Ellis led the Orangemen
to a 49-33 rebounding edge, including
18 offensive boards. Syracuse improved
to 19-0 this season when out-rebounding
its opponents.

“We just got demolished on the
offensive boards. We couldn’t match
up with them," Evans said.

Lady Panthers hand St. John's Express 75-70 defeat

By Ryan Buncher
Staﬂ“ Writer

Center Cozette Ballentine of St.
John’s entered Saturday's game
against Pitt as the hottest player
in the Big East.

She had scored 82 points and
grabbed 20 rebounds in two
games the previous week, earning
Big East Player of the Week
honors. She was the leading scorer
in the conference with an average
of 25.8 points per game. That
includes burning Pitt for 28 points

to go along with 18 rebounds in
the Express’ 68-56 defeat of the
Lady Panthers earlier this season.
This time, however, she could
only score 13 points before fouling
out late in the second half. It was
Lady Panther Lorri Johnson who
was the star with 31 points and 11'
rebounds as Pitt won 75-70.
“Our intensity was up this time.
We were more scrappy than the
first game, ' said Coach Kirk Bruce.
The Lady Panthers raised their
record to 15-11 overall and 10-5
in the Big East. The team now

stands alone in third place ahead
of the Express. 9

Pitt got strong performances
from both of its centers, as both
freshman Jonna Huemrich and
senior Connie Hurt stopped
Ballentine defensively and
contributed 10 points and eight
rebounds and 16 points,
respectively. Jenine Joyce and
Lisa Fessler each contributed six
points. Freshman point guard Erin
Maloy only scored two, but had
four assists and six rebounds while
playing the entire 40 minutes.

Guard Margaret McKeon led the
Express with 22 points.

The reason Maloy was forced
to play the whole game was due
to the absence of sophomore
point guard Maureen McConnell.
She did not make the trip, so in
addition to missing the St. John’s
game she will miss tonight’s game
at Connecticut. Bruce said her
status for the Big East tournament,
which begins Friday, is still
undetermined.

Johnson is still recovering from
a knee injury. “She’s not back to

full strength yet, but she was
better tonight,” said Bruce.
UConn is first in the Big East, as
it has been all season. The Lady
Panthers dealt the Huskies their
only conference loss of the
season, and one of only three
losses overall, 61-59 at Fitzgerald
Field House. Pitt held two-time
Big East player of the year Kerry
Bascom to only 10 points, nine
below her season average.

again be a key. Pitt's inside game

The Pitt women's gymnastics
team broke the school-record
score of 18530 last weekend
against Penn State but was not
able to defeat the I.ady Lions,
who took first, 188.60.

Saturday's meet was held in
the PSU Recreation Center before
a packed audience. ‘‘I love Penn
State. I love the crowd,” said
Pitt's Gina Venezia. The PSU
crowd was very supportive to all
the gymnasts.

“They're a good crowd," said
Jeannie Vecchio, “because ifyou
do something good, they are
going to be there supporting
you. Ifthere is a bad score shown
for Pitt, they’re going to boo it.
'Ihey’re not all just total Penn
State.”

The meet was run in a head-to-
head match; one of the PSU’s
gymnasts would perform,
followed by one of Pitt’s
gymnasts. This allowed the judges
to get a better look at each
gymnast’s routine.

The competition opened with
vaulting. The Pittsquad turned in
clean vaults for a score of 46.20,
but was not able to capture the
event from the PSU squad (48.25).

Strong vaulting performances
for the Lady Panthers came from
Carrie Carnesale (9.40), Kathy
Wallish (9.30), Venezia (9.25),
Vecchio (9.20) and Kristen Brown

-51) (9.05).

The second round was the
uneven parallel bars. Both teams
performed strong routines, with
the PSU squad scoring 46.60 and
Pitt scoring 46.20.

The Lady Panthers bar squad
has been stronger and more
consistent as the season
progresses. The Lady Panthers
did not experience any falls on
bars this past weekend, whereas
PSU had one.

.1‘ Strong performances for the

Pitt squad came from Vecchio
(9.50), Carnesale (9.25), Jen
Butkovich (9.25), Wallish (9.20)
and Karen Jorgensen (9.00).
The third round of the
competition was the balance
beam, and both teams had some
trouble. Pitt fell from the beam
three times and scored a 45.40,
while PSU fell from the beam just
once and scored a 46.15.
Strong performances on beam

Carnesale (8.70).

The final event of the evening
was the floor exercises. PSU
scored a 47.60, and Pitt scored a
47.55, a new school record.

“Knowing that one of our top
floor performers is still out lTina
Taylor], we still can pull through.
You never know when something
is going to happen, when
someone is going to be sick or

said Vecchio.

Turning in strong performances
for Pitt were Vecchio (9.65),
Brown (9.60), Jorgensen (9.55),
Venezia (9.55), Carnesale (9.20)
and Wallish (9.10).

The Panthers did not do much

Pitt’s poor play was best
described by Morningstar. “They

Pitt will try to rebound from its
loss Tuesday at Boston College.

“We’ve just got to try and finish

Miller. “It feels like the end ofthe

points in the second half, and he
and Owens combined for six
blocks to keep the Panthers from
making a serious run.

Shorter, who had 1 1 points and
seven rebounds in the first half,
was held to only two points and
one board in the second half by
Ellis. Shorter had 32 points in
Pitt’s 93-79 victory at the Civic
Arena on Jan. 7. ‘I think they
were keying on me a lot more,”
Shorter said. “When I got the ball,
someone would ﬂash down and
double up.”

“Our defensive pressure was
better, and we didn’t let him get
the ball where he wanted it. The
difference is, we pressured the

Owens and Boeheim credited
Ellis with playing tough defense

said

Boeheim said, ‘We put LeRon

him up pretty good and didn’t let

Meanwhile, Owens was doing
it all for the Orangemen. He shot
13 for 20 from the field, including
two for two from three-point

Reaction from other countries...
Frances foreign policy will

Israel will not retaliate against
Iraq out of sheer Vengeance

livery change in the power balance in
the Middle Iiast worries Israel. We are a 
Rotem

very small country — /4 million people
surrounded by more than I00 million
hostile Arabs. And when Saddam Ilussein
invaded Kuwait, it lit a red light in Israel.

We were worried because we knew
exactly who this leader is and how big and
cruel his war machine is. We knew what
his next step would be if he were not
stopped. llut this time, we believed, we
were not involved. Saddam had threatened
world order, peace and safety, and the
international community would take care
ofhim. Israeli officials did and said nothing.
Israel kept a very low profile. Iraq had
invaded Kuwait because of economic
reasons and an old land conflict.

But when Saddam understood that he
was facing war, he looked for another
excuse — one that would help him unite
the Aral) world and look better in the
media. And he chose, for the first time in
his life, to be the godfather ofthe Palestinian
issue.

While trying to gain the world’s pity by
showing a bomb shelter with civilians hit
by an American missile (and we all know
that he arranged for them to be there to
make his case), Hussein has fired more
than 30 missiles on Israel —— all targeted at
civilians. T'his is without any provocation
from Israel and without any reasonable
excuse.

The Palestinian so-called “freedom
fighters” joined Saddam from Day 1,

fighting their own “freedom war,” while
the freedom of Kuwait, an independent
Aral) country, was humiliated. And the
Palestinians, who use the media so well
to show how their people are being
killed after provoking the Israeli soldiers,
stood on the roofs of their houses,
cheering while the missiles hit Tel Aviv.

For the time being, Israel has not
retaliated. We may do so in the future but
not as a matter of revenge. If we do so,
it will be in order to ensure our existence,
as we have done in the past. We are not
happy to see what has happened to Iraq
and to the Iraqi people. It is terrible. But
this is the price civilians have to pay and
have paid in the past for having a leader
who is a megalomaniac and who does
not care about the life ofhis own people.

The American people have the chance
to come into our living rooms and to
have a close look at our enemies —— to
see just how easy it is to negotiate with
them, to see how much they care about
human lives and to see who the Palestine
Liberation ()rgani'/.ation really is.

The war is not over yet. And after it is
over and the American troops have
returned home, Israel will still be there.

justifying the war in the Persian Gulf
by invoking the defense of democratic
and human rights is, in a way, ignoring
the claims and rights of other countries
in the world to have their political and
economic problems solved. The law is
undoubtedly disregarded in all four
corners of the world even if winds of
justice and freedom sometimes seem to
blow over some countries. The history of
liastern Iiurope has dramatically changed
in these last couple of years, and a Soviet
leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, even received
the Nobel Peace Prize.

But peace is such a frail word to use.
This pastjanuary, Gorbachev decided to
send his troops to Lithuania. Almost at
the same time, George Bush decided to
start a war in the Persian Gulf — to
defend the world against the enemy and
the man to eliminate: Saddam Ilussein.

Today, the Iraqi leader has become the
Ilitler ofthe 19905. Ilis devilish acts must
be stopped by any means. This argument
appears to be one of the main reasons
used by the allies to justify their military
actions in the Persian Gulf; they insist
that the UN. resolution has to be
respected and achieved.

Why, then, have the governments of
the United States, England and France
decided to start a war with a country
which they were still supplying weapons
to only a few months ago? Why don't we
start looking at that war as a dramatic
development in the relationships between

Leteintorier

the Arab world and the Western world,

rather than consider it as a light for freedom f

and peace?

I hear that good will prevail over evil,
and that a “new world order” will be
established, but that feeling cannot be
shared by European countries, especially
France. Peace cannot possibly be built on
the destruction of Iraq, U.S. domination of
the Persian Gulf and the tensions which
will strongly shake the relationships among
Europe and the Arab countries supporting
Iraq (particularly the Maghreb countries).

Since the end of the Algerian War,

France has tried hard enough to establislO

good relationships with the Arab countries,
and partly following this principle, the
French government has waited until the
last minute to join the international alliance
against Iraq.

liven though France is trying now to
maintain a very close contact with Maghreb
countries like Algeria and Morocco, I do
not know how it plans to deal with two
struggles deeply linked: the withdrawal of
Iraq from Kuwait, with all the consequences
that it may have, and the resolution of the
Palestinian problem. France, along with
the other allied countries, will have a lot to

Jewish
students.
say War
necessary

Mike
Srulevich

With war raging in the
Persian Gulf, many Jewish
students in America are
struggling to come to terms
with the harsh realities of
being citizens of a nation at
war and with the war's
effects on Israel as well.

Although most Jewish
students are divided about
supporting the war, there is
a consensus that Saddam

Hussein needs to be
stopped.

“War is wrong,” said
senior Marc Reiter. “It's very
unfortunate that people
have to lose their lives, but
at this point it's necessary
to go to war. Ifwe didn't do
it now, five years later
Hussein could have nuclear
capabilities, and loss oflife
would be a lot worse.”

“I don't believe in war,"
said sophomore Allison
Bergman, “but by the same
token I’m against the raping
and violence that Saddam
did to Kuwait and even his
own people.”

Iraqi Scud missile attacks
on Israel have brought a
new dimension to the war
for many Jewish students.
Israel is of special signif-
icance to many American
Jews. Having been inter-
woven into religious and
cultural aspects ofJudaism
throughout the centuries,
Israel holds the roots of the

Jewish people,

Therefore, Israel has a
personal meaning forJews
all over the world. The
Zionist movement estab-
lished in the early 1900s
aimed to create a Jewish
homeland which would
bring all Jews to live in
Israel. Each year hundreds
of American Jews travel to
Israel. For many American
Jews, the state of Israel is
central to their Jewish
identities.

“The first time Israel was
attacked, I stayed up all
night watching the news,”
said senior David Finkle,
who lived in Israel for two
years. “When they annou-
nced the neighborhoods of
Tel Aviv that were being
hit, I could picture them in
my mind.”

Beverly Schwartz, a first-
year student, has never
been to Israel, nor does she
have any close ties there.
On learning of the attack,
however, she said, “It was
like my own neighborhood
back home was being hit. I
never really identiﬁed with

‘I will do my duty...’

ROTC cadets prepare

The decade of the 1960s will
forever be marked as one of
public dissatisfaction with an
undeclared war. This dissatis-
faction manifested itself in a
vitriolic hatred of all things
military. Those of us who served
never understood why this hatred
was directed at the messenger
instead of the government which
sent the message in the form of
foreign policy. ROTC detach-
ments on college campuses
throughout the nation were a
popular target of peace groups.

Time heals all wounds, however
— even those of war. Two
decades later our nation is
engaged in another conflict under
manifestly different circum-
stances. Peace groups have
admitted the mistakes of the
former era and are not repeating
them. The Army, in general, has
the support and approval of the
American people, and ROTC
programs continue to function
without controversy.

As I reflect on the nature of
war, the mission of universities
and the individual and collective
contributions of ROTC programs
across the nation, I hear a voice
from the past speak the truth for
our times. Thucydides said, “A
nation that draws too broad a
difference between its scholars
and its warriors will have its

thinking done by cowards and its
fighting done by fools.”

That simple quotation
underscores the essential role of
ROTC programs in the university
environment. Moreover, itnplitit
in this statement is the idea that
societal values must l)e fostered
and defended, thereby IICLTL'S~
sitating personal and public
sacriﬁces on a stupendous scale.

June 1991 marks the 75th
anniversary of Army R()'l'(2. Its
mission then, as now, is “to
develop the future officer
leadership of the United States
Army.” The shoulder patch worn
by all ROTC cadets reflects that
mission. Its shape depicts a shield
which symbolizes the Army’s
mission of national defense and
is divided into four quarters
representing the four traditional
military-science courses com-
prising the senior RO'I'(j
curriculum. The sword signifies
the courage, gallantry and self-
sacrifice intrinsic to the profession
of arms. The lamp denotes the
pursuit of knowledge, higher
learning and the partnership of
the Army ROTC with American
colleges and universities. The
Greek helmet is symbolic of the
ancient civilizations concept of
the warrior-scholar. Our motto,
“Leadership Excellence," ex-
presses the ultimate responsibility

 

to serve their country

.ofArmy ROTC in the discharge of

its moral responsibility to the
nation. Since our humble
beginning in 1916, the percentage
of currently serving officers
produced by the ROTC program
has risen to 70 percent of the total
force. ROTC graduates have
fought and died in every major
conflict our nation has
participated in since 1920.
Operation Desert Storm will add
still more names to that already
long roll. Over 100 Pitt graduates
are currently serving in Saudi
Arabia — most ofthem in harm's
way. Already one of our alumni
has fallen, and it must be assumed
that more will give what is
euphemistically called “the
ultimate sacrifice to our nation."
This reality obviously has an
impact upon ROTC and the
student body as a whole.

Why do students enroll in
ROTC? No student enrolls with
the goal offighting a war. Indeed,
the purpose of an army is
deterrence, not fighting. Students
enroll in ROTC for a plethora of

reasons; money, adventure and a
genuine love of nation are but a
few. Students learn about ethics,
leadership, military theories,
training and the tools of an
incredibly complex trade.

When a war actually begins,
our somewhat bucolic per-
spective on life is shattered by
reality. Surprisingly, the people
least affected by this trauma are
ROTC cadets. I attribute this to
the coursework in the ROTC
program. Geopolitics, ethics and
a deep abiding confidence in
their abilities and training tend to
mitigate unnecessary worry that
is prevalent in the general
community.

ROTC students are able to
dissect the limited war news and
understand what is really
happening. While this particular
war will not affect their lives
directly, they understand
historical imperatives that seem
to indicate that this particular
war may actually decrease their
chances of participating in a future
conflict in the same region.

The bigger impact is that they
also know some of the Pitt
graduates currently serving in
Saudi Arabia. The military science
department receives letters from
these graduates describing their
adventures, problems and yes,

African Americans must take part despite others’ practices

I have been asked countless

_questions regarding African-

American participation in the

‘current war as well as the military

itself. For me, there is no question.
African-Americans must part-
icipate, and the only question is,
“How shall they participate?” It
has been documented thoroughly
that African-Americans are in the
“desert” in gross disproportion to
their numbers in the American
population.

We know that this disprop()r-
tionate representation is a function
of the tragic over-representation
of African-Americans in the
growing American underclass.

Notwithstanding these cruel
realities, those African-American
men and woman in the “desert”
must participate, and hopefully
they will do so with a minimum
loss of life and bodily,
psychological and spiritual harm.

For those African-Americans
who question participation in the
American military branches, I
again do not view this as a viable
question. An African—American
has not been president. American
presidents have done inestimable
harm to the millions of African-
Americans and their just collective
cause. Yet bad practice in the
highest office in the country is no

reason for Af rican—Americans not
to achieve and aspire to the
presidency.
African-Americans cannot
refuse to participate in the judicial
system because, among other
things, African-Americans are
disproportionately on death row.
African~Americans cannot refuse
to participate in the gigantic
multibillion dollar mass-media
industry because it is currently

one of the most wicked instru-
ments for reinforcing racism.

African-American students,
faculty and administrators cannot
fail to participate in the affairs of
the University of Pittsburgh
because this great university has
yet to achieve greatness with
regard to the myriad issues
associated with African-Amer-
icans.

We cannot surrender! Refusal
to participate in any major
dimension of the American
political, military, economic,
educational and social system is
to surrender. Our mothers and
fathers, and their mothers and

fathers, have paid too high a
price in blood and other sacriﬁces
for us to surrender.

What African—Americans must
do today is go to the head of their
class in all areas of American life.
Those who are here at the
University of Pittsburgh would
do well to achieve at the highest
levels of academic excellence.
Those who wish to take a stand
against the specific war in
question should do so in the best
of African-American traditions.
For my personal part, I know that
no holocaust is justifiable.

war in order to watch the slick graphics
and prepared statements of the reporters
and generals.

The United States has a history oftaking
war to other countries and keeping us
ignorant of the destruction and of what is
really happening. Whether it was Nixon’s
invasion of Cambodia, Reagan's
involvement in Nicaragua or Bush's
invasion of Panama, we did not have to
live with soldiers in our streets and bomb
craters in place of our homes.

This distance makes it easier for

Americans to have a vision of war that is

romantic and bloodless or filled with
Rambo heroics.

The war in the Middle East is not just a
necessary evil to destroy a cruel dictator.
It is a symptom of something bigger. Our
country has resorted to war because our

society is organized around aggression
and dominance. Our children grow up
playing with G.I. Joe dolls and plastic
machine guns. They are taught to kill their
enemies in the spots where they play.
They watch fantastic war movies.

The ability to wage war is seen as a sign
of strength and of more importance than
educating our people or feeding our
hungry. Communication and diplomacy
are seen as weak and time—consuming.
Because of these attitudes, our country
has rushed to begin bombing Iraq instead
of laboring with the United Nations to
reach a peaceful resolution to this complex
conflict.

There are no easy answers — we cannot
ignore Saddam’s actions, but we cannot
expect that decimating his country will
solve the problems either.

This war is not only destroying Iraq and

Kuwait but our own country as well. We
cannot afford to put all our money toward
financing a war and rebuilding the area
when we are facing an economic recession.

Already student loans have been cut, as
well as food and shelter for the growing
number of homeless people. The budgets
of the veterans’ hospitals have been cut
before the casualties of the ground war
even arrive for treatment. What are our
government's priorities: power and control
of oil in the Middle East or the quality of
life for the people of this country? Who
will decide what the priorities will be:
George Bush and his cabinet or the
American people?

The leaders of this country are not
acting independently of the people who
put them into power. We as citizens have
a right to be told the truth and to hold our
leaders accountable for their actions. If

you oppose killing innocent people —
men, women and children with lives and
families like your own —then it is your job
to tell your government to stop this war
and all other wars. It is your job to voice
your opinion, to write to the people you
put in office and to shout in the streets to
make them understand your point of
view.

Everyone together has the right to decide
how our leaders will act and what they
will do. Ilow can we be sure that they are
not acting only in their own best interests
unless we make then answer to us? It is our
responsibility as people to end the
bloodshed and death this war is creating
and which our apathy has allowed to
occur.

Middle Iiast will have to contend
with this disaster for many years

come.

The oil spill is endangering
birds, dolphins and even humans.
Saudi Arabia depends on the sea
for its supply of drinking water.
The oil threatens to shut down
Saudi Arabia’s largest -water
desalinization plant. Saddam has
also set fire to Kuwaiti oil wells in
an attempt to mask surveillance
by planes and satellites.

Smartly, the president has
stayed out of the day-to-day
military affairs. He is letting the
professional soldiers do their jobs,
which they have been trained to

‘.do. Johnson made the mistake of

choosing daily bombing targets
that were of no military value.
Luckily, we have three leading
military men making these
decisions, along with many other
capable men and women backing
them up.

Generals Colin Powell and
Norman Schwarzkopf and
Secretary Dick Cheney are the
three men. They have great charm
and charisma, which are

ecessary in a leader, but they
also have the intelligence to make
the right decisions in battle.

Now we turn to the home front
of the war. In recent polls, over
80 percent support the president
and the actions he has taken in
the gulf. But a few have chosen
to voice their opposition to the
actions being taken. They believe
that ifwe stop the war in the gulf,
everything will be all right. lfthey
want a perfect world, they can go
to Disney World.

Peace protesters support our
troops, but when their actions
demoralize the troops, their
protesting should stop. The troops
need our support, and when the
media shows people protesting
against the war, the troops begin
to g< ciepressetj. .hey say college

students are protesting because

they are over there and not here
in the trenches; their perspective
would change ifthey had to face
what we do day in and day out.

The soldiers smile when they

‘see pictures ofthe American flag

and all the yellow ribbons people
are wearing. They know that they
are there to do their job and they
just want to come home, but they
can't until Saddam is stopped.
The truth of the matter is that
people like Saddam have power

and like to use it against people
who have less power than they
do. Saddam has also attacked
Israel, which does have a military,
but Israel has not become
involved in the war. The Israelis
don’t feel that it is their war to
fight and want to stay out of it.

But Saddam keeps attacking
with Scud missiles, and Israel
doesn't retaliate. Some Iraqi
people even believe that Israel is
sending jets to bomb them

because that is what Saddam
wants them to believe. When and
iflsrael retaliates, Iraq will know
it. Rememberback in 1981 when
Israel bombed the Iraqi nuclear
facility? Everybody condemned
them, but now everybody is
praising them. Think what kind
of war we would be facing if
Saddam had nuclear power and
weapons.

The United States also has
power, but it wants to use its

power to stop people like
Saddam. When was the last time
the United States started a war?
We have become involved in
wars, but we don’t start them. As
the world’s superpower, our
policy dictates to a large extent
what goes on in the rest of the

world. If we were to sit idly by,
that would signify that aggression
is all right, and soon other leaders
would follow Saddam’s footsteps

ROTC

Continued from page P-3
even fears. ROTC by its very
nature is an extended family. As
such we all worry about our
brothers and sisters when‘ we
know they are in danger.

Perhaps the largest impact of
the war upon ROTC is yet to
come. Freshman enrollment is
holding steady, but the true test
will come with the class of 1995,
which enrolls this fall. As I stated
earlier, an informed view enables
us to be objective, but incoming
freshmen have not been exposed
to deductive logic. Therefore they
may be more likely to react to
instinctive fear rather than to
reason it out.

My personal prediction is that
enrollment will decline, but it
will not significantly impact on
the ability of ROTC to provide a

more than adequate number of
ollicers. The Army will be reduced
by nearly 200,000 soldiers by
1995, regardless of the war in the
gulf. This preplanned reduction
has already started with a
substantial reduction in
scholarship dollars and a general
toughening of the standards
required for commissioning. The
combination of these two
disparate events may prove to be
troublesome, but only the passage
of time will answer that question.
The provision of ROTC
programs is consistent with the
mission of colleges and
universities. Higher education
affords one a path toward self-
enrichment and facilitates human
enlightenment. The Army, by
requiring its commissioned
officers to possess a college

And we will still face Syria,
Libya and other Arab countries
who are not much better off
than Iraq. The Palestinian
problem, which has been put
under a microscope for years,
is only a minor part of the
Arabdsraeli conflict. It cannot
be solved by itself. It will be

solved only after we sit down
together with all the Arab
countries and find a solution
— which we in Israel have, for
more than four decades, been
searching for.

degree, reflects the values of a
society which is committed to
the enhancement of educational
opportunities for its citizenry.
As reflected in its diversity, the
Army is comprised of individuals
who share the values of our
cultural, social and political
institutions. Moreover, ROTC
cadets exemplify the virtues of
personal and professional
dedication to duty and selﬂess
service.

Upon enrolling in ROTC
classes, Pitt Army cadets are
greeted with the following creed:
“lam an Army cadet. Soon I will
take an oath and become an
Army officer committed to
defending the values which make
this nation great. Honor is my
touchstone. I understand mission
first and people always.

“I am the past: the spirit of
those warriors who have made
the final sacrifice.

“I am the present: the scholar
and apprentice soldier enhancing
my skills in the science of warfare
and the art of leadership.

“But above all, I am the future:
the future warrior leader of the
United States Army. May God
give me the compassion and
judgment to lead and the gallantry
in battle to win.”

This creed represents the three
values of duty, honor and country
inculcated into every officer
serving our nation. Professional
officers enjoy an extremely high
public approval rating in terms of
trust and confidence. This trust is
a direct result of those virtues
which pervade our every thought.

Do cadets at the University of

Pittsburgh subscribe to these
virtues? The answer.
unequivocally, is, “yes!” Pitt’s
cadets represent a broad cross-
section of the student body. Only
30 percent are on scholarship —
thus indicating a stronger motive
than monetary reward.

The initial reasons for
participating in an ROTC program
gradually fall by the wayside only
tobe replaced with a strong sense
of duty to country and pride in
themselves. Pitt graduates proudly
represent their school and their
country throughout the world.

The University of Pittsburgh
Army ROTC cadets will do their
duty.

Israel all that much. I guess it
took an attack to really make me
appreciate what was always there
for me.”

“Unlike our parents," said
sophomore Jeff Walters, “we've
grown u p with Israel always there
for us to go and see, but I never
really thought about something
like this actually happening. It's
really scary to think that Israel’s
existence is being threatened.”

Israel, the size of New Jersey,
and home to 4.3 million Jews, is
a little state surrounded by six
Arab countries whose populations
combined total just over 100
million people. As Israel has had
to endure overwhelming odds
and five wars through its 43-year
history, it has built up one of the
strongest armies in the Middle
East. Israel's policy has always
been to strike back when
attacked.

Israel, after being hit, was asked

by the United States and the allies
not to retaliate, and Israel didn’t.
But the missile attacks continued,
and Israel was still being told to
hold off. This caused some mixed
feelings on the part of some
American Jewish students who
said Israel had a right to defend
itself. "1 was angry at America,"
said sophomore Eric Davis. ‘After

- telling Israel not to retaliate, the

U.S. allowed Israel to be hit again.”

A sense of frustration also
pervades the minds of many
students. While Israel is being
attacked, the students are sitting
here in America under no
imminent danger, simply
‘watching’ the events unfold. ‘I
feel like I should be there lin
Israell doing something,” said
Reiter, echoing many Jewish
students. A few students even
said they would go to Israel if
other Arab countries got involved
with Israel.

By and large, students are

having mixed feelings and seem
torn about continuing their day
to-day lives in the United States
while desperately wanting t ) go
to Israel and help out.

On Sunday, Feb. 10, students
held a coffeehouse at Schenley
Cafe for those who wanted to
share their thoughts and concerns
about Israel. There was a lot of
laughter and fun marked with
fear and concern as students
performed songs and read poems
at an open microphone.

As American citizens concerned
with U.S. interests, as Jews

concerned about the future oi‘

Israel and as people concerned
about the moral implications of
the war, Jewish students are facing
many questions which they will
need to evaluate, but which they
may never fully solve.

It will be hard to face the anti-

spread if Iraq is crushed. The

large Moslem community in
France would also suffer very
much from a separation between

war. They need to preserve thcbv

frail stability in France, but they
also feel bound to the Iraqi
citizens, who are already the
victims of that war.

Solidarity does not necessarily
mean acceptance of Saddam’s
actions in the gulfand his invasion
of Kuwait; rather, it is a natural
reaction ofcertain Arab countries
against the Western world, which
has always tried to impose its
"superior" culture on them.

The war has already led tr‘

aggressiveness, racism and
intolerance, not only in the Arab
world but also in the United
States and Europe. If every
individual only cared a little about
the fate ofMan on a planet which
is abused every day, we would
maybe hear more about peace —
a peace that could be discussed
after a cease—fire in an
international conference.

After having shown their
effectiveness in destructive
military actions, the leaders of

that war might want to give?)

evidence of their diplomatic and
human potential as well as of
their understanding of universal
democracy.
