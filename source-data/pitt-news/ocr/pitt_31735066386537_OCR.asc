Angel Jurado was the
secretary of the Human Rights
Commission of Huancavelica,
Peru, until Feb. 27, 1990. On
that date, Jurado “disap-
peared”; he has not been seen
or heard from since.

Jurado was one of the ﬁve
prisoners of conscience
remembered at the Amnesty
International candlelight vigil
last night. The vigil was held
as part of Human Rights Week.

“The vigil is a remembrance
of all the political prisoners
throughout the world to show
that we are remembering them,
and we have not forgotten
them even though they may
have disappeared,” said AI
president Jennifer Coopie.

According to Leah Hill, AI ‘
co—coordinator, the vigil should
alert people to the issue of
human rights.

Students registering for courses for next
semester may have noticed one or more
errors on their academic—status reports,
but according to Assistant Dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences Linda Burns,
the situation is under control.

According to Burns, certain ﬁles were
damaged in the computer system
previously used by the University of
Pittsburgh to maintain academic records.

Burns said that the Office of the Dean ﬁrst
became aware of the problem during the
summer of 1990, but that the errors were
thought to be restricted to the area of
transfer credits. When this proved
inaccurate, the discrepancy came under
further investigation. The full extent of the
damage could not be determined, she
said, although advanced—standing credits
were also discovered to have been
damaged.

Burns said that the problem was
eventually considered not worth correcting

Lothrop key stolen,
2 rooms vandalized

By Karen D. Speece

and Jim Wechsler
The Pitt News

Students are being advised to
turn their radios on when they
leave their rooms due to a missing

master key to Lothrop Hall.

“Everyone’s room is susceptible
now. We don’t want to start a
panic  Two of [the rooms on
my floor] got hit. One of the girls
on my ﬂoor had her typewriter
and some money stolen. I’m
patrolling my ﬂoor, and the ofﬁcer
comes up here periodically, ” Amy
Boley, a resident assistant said.

Boley said that the reporting
ofﬁcer told her not to tell the res-
idents so that a panic would not
be created among them. Other
RAs have also been instructed to
do the same.

“The only thing I know is that
when the desk attendant came
in, the key was not there.
Someone just told me recently
that it was gone. The only thing
I’ve been doing is praying that it
gets back soon. I really don’t

want to spread it around yet,"
Camille Cade, an RA, said.

Angela Grohol had a typewriter,
a checkbook and $30 stolen.

“I came in and my door was
unlocked,” she said. After realizing
she had been robbed, she called
the campus police.

According to Grohol, the officer
informed her that another girl on
her ﬂoor had been robbed the
night before. Grohol said she
later learned that other residents
on the third and sixth ﬂoors had
reported thefts.

“The key has been gone since
last night. We have no clue where
it’s at. I’ve heard that two people’s
rooms have been broken into,
but I don’t know for a fact. The
key opens every single door in
the building,” said desk attendant
Stacie Miller.

“My RA just found out about an
hour or two ago,” said Robin Bell,
a desk attendant.

“It’s been a rumor, but it has not
been confirmed. We are not sure
if it’s not there,” said Mary Ellen
Hiotakis, the resident director.

“This [previous] system is obsolete,” she

Burns added that the Ofﬁce of the Dean
has been developing an ISIS-compatible
monitoring system with the assistance of
the Ofﬁce of Computing and Information
Services since the spring term. She said
that the new system will not include any
new information, but it will be a means of
accessing existing information.

“The new system should really be much
better,” she said. _

Burns explained the new system: It will
keep track of students’ academic-record
information within the ISIS ﬁles. A transcript
will be created for each student, along
with his or her academic—status report,
Burns said.

“Never at the University of Pittsburgh
have individual student academic records
been on line before," Burns said.

Credit card causes conﬂict

By Renee Crespy
Staﬂ‘ Writer

Junk mail.

Everyone gets it and usually
throws it away, but not without
first glancing through it to make
sure that there isn’t an important
letter, bill or check stashed away
in there.

Frank Markewinski was doing
just that when he spotted an
envelope containing an American
Expresscredit card engraved with
his wife’s name and the University
of Pittsburgh's emblem. Confused,
he questioned his wife, a Pitt
employee, as to why they received
the card, but neither one could
figure it out. So Markewinski
started to call different places,
asking where the card had come
from.

According to Markewinski, he
called the Pitt beneﬁts ofﬁce, the
American Express office in
Arizona and Pitt President Wesley

Posvar’s ofﬁce but came up with
nothing. American Express told
him that he should know about
the card because in order to
receive it, he would have had to
sign for it.

“A credit card came to my house '

with the university’s name on it,
and no one knows where it came
from, and neither my wife or I
signed for it,” said Markewinski.

Markewinski ﬁnally found out
from the purchasing office that
the university had sent credit cards
to all employees, and since his
wife works for the university, she
received one.

Andrew Hughey, assistant
general council for Pitt, said that
memos were sent out to all
employees stating that they would
be receiving a credit card, and if
they didn’t want it, they should
destroy it. “We sent memos out
on Nov. 20, 1989 and on Feb. 12,
1990," he said.

Markewinski claims that neither

he nor his wife ever received
those letters. “I pose this as a
problem for me because my wife
and I share the bills, and if she
receives a card that we didn’t ask
for, then it’s my problem also,” he
said.

According to Markewinski, if
he didn’t want the card, he had to
send it back. He feels that it
should be the other way around.

“The university supposedly has
a right to send people a card
unless we otherwise say so. I
think_it’s called presumption. Even
if we would have gotten the letter,
why do we have to send it back
in order not to get it? It’s stupid. I
feel it’s not a good way to do
business,” he said.

“This is an individual right that’s
being infringed on. What they
should be saying is that if we
don’t receive your card by such
and such a date, we know that
you don’t want it. If people start

IFC cbanges ms/9,

The Inter-Fraternity Council approved changes for its rush
policies and accepted first-round nominations for executive
board positions at a meeting in the William Pitt Union last
evening.

During the rush period of the fall term, the IFC will hold a
meeting to educate potential rushees about the Greek system.
The meeting will be highly recommended for all potential
members and will help attain more directed and knowledgeable
rushees, according to an IFC resolution.

Representatives also adopted a policy which will limit the
number of brothers at the “Meet the Greeks" rush event to
seven. Limiting the number of brothers at this event will allow
the event to run more smoothly and efficiently, the resolution
said. ‘

A third amendment will regulate the amount of time between '
the first day of informal wish and the ﬁrst day that a house can
give out bids, allowing ﬁve to seven days, subject to calendar.

“All houses would hand in bids, and they would be stamped.

CWO president stresses feminist ideas

By Rebecca Wilkins
saw’ W1-lter

Stephanie Helsel, a soft-spoken
native of Virginia, is proud to be
a feminist and a co—president of
Campus Women’s
Organization.

“People think [feminism] is such
a dirty word, but it is really a
positive thing. It’s working for
social change to create a world
for
everybody,” said Helsel.

Helsel said that as a child, she
was disturbed that her father was
automatically seen as having more
power than her mother. This
alerted her to the world of
women’s issues at an early age,
she said.

“I think in ways I always had a
feminist orientation, but I didn’t
really have the vocabulary within

A which to place it," she said.

As a first-year student at Pitt,
Helsel took Psychology of Gender,
which she feels opened her eyes
to the male orientation of the ed-
ucational system and inspired her

to take more women’s studies
courses.

After her graduation next
spring, Helsel plans to follow her
psychology/women’s studies
major with a graduate degree.

Eventually she hopes to have a
job that allows her to “focus on
research but deal with feminist
issues and within that try to
educate some people. That’s how
my eyes were opened, and I
think that I would like to be able
to do that, too,” she said.

She also plans to continue her
political involvement, concen-
trating on the issue of a woman’s
choice to control her own repro-
ductive system. Helsel said that
she finds it difficult to deal with
people who oppose choice.

“Our orientation allows them a
place. They’re allowed to feel
however they want, and if
abortion isn’t something they
would choose for themselves,
that’s fine. It is so frustrating to
come up against a group of people
who would impose their morals

Pitt gets
$8 million
for center

By Margaret Swisher
Staff Writer
The Pitt School of

Medicine’s department of
psychiatry has received an
$ 8 million grant to establish
an adolescent-alcoholism
research center.

This is the ﬁrst National
Institute on Alcohol Abuse
and Alcoholism—funded
project specifically oriented
to the study of adolescent
alcoholism in the United
States.

“The purpose of the
research center is to study
the impact of teenage
alcoholism,” said Dr.
Howard B. Moss, scientiﬁc
director of the research
center and associate
professor of psychiatry.

Center director and
professor of psychiatry Dr.
Samuel Gershon, said the
study will also allow them

to attempt to assess the

developing and maturing
adolescent.

The study hopes to
discover the effects al-
coholism has on physical
growth, emotional deve-
lopment and the ability to
learn, said Gershon.

A corps of 36 Pitt faculty
members from a variety of
departments will conduct
the study.

“We have people who
come from different fields
of experience,” Moss said.
“They will think of new and
important ways of
approaching these
problems,” Moss said.

Moss said the end product
from all the research will be
tailored to a treatment
program. “We’re studying
problems produced by
teenage alcoholism to
develop highly specific
prevention programs. That's
why it’s worth 33 .8 million,”
Moss said.

Approximately 600
alcohol-abusing adol-
escents, 100 depressed
adolescent females and 250
normal adolescents will be
recruited to participate in
the study. Gershon said they
will recruit adolescents from
the community and from
Western Psychiatric Institute
& Clinic.

The research center will
be located in WPIC and in
3501 Forbes Center. W

Moss said the department '
received less than the
amount it asked for when it
applied for the grant but
believes it will be able to do
the job it’s proposing to do.

The NIAAA grant will
extend for five years. After
that time the department
can reapply for continuation
of the grant, said Moss.

University Club celebrates 1 00th birthday

By Renee Crespy
Sta_ﬂ‘ Writer

The University Club of
Pittsburgh is celebrating its 100th
anniversary this year with a black-
tie centennial ball on Nov. 17.

The University Club was
founded in 1890 when 23 men in
Pittsburgh united as charter
members. They formed the club
for the purpose of promoting
literature and art by establishing
and maintaining a library, reading
room and art gallery.

These men included D.T.
Watson, a Harvard law graduate
who represented the United States
during the Alaska Sea boundary-
rights controversy with England,
and George W. Guthrie, who was
both an ambassador to Japan and
mayor of Pittsburgh. Another
member once won the Nobel
Peace Prize.

The club has had five different
homes around the Oakland area
in the course of 100 years and has
had to move because of lack of

space. At one time the University
Club’s tennis courts were located
where the Cathedral of Learning
is today.

The criteria for becoming a
member of the University Club is
obtaining a degree from a four-
year accredited college and
getting recommendations from
two members. Because these are
the only qualifications, the board
of directors of the club has been
extremely progressive over the
years in the admission of women
and minorities, according to Betsy
Sallade-Farina, general manager
for the University Club.

“We’ve been very open,
especially since the ’70s. This
put us about 15 years ahead of a
lot of clubs in the area,” Sallade-
Farina said.

There are currently 1,750
members of the University Club,
and there are six classifications
of members.

“Class One is for people who
have just graduated from college,
and it is very affordable for people

It’s really simple; all you have to
do is pick up the stamped bids,”
Brent Saunders, internal vice
president, said.

Under this policy, no bids
without an IFC stamp would be
accepted from a fraternity.
Potential rushees would be
informed that if the bid paper
was not stamped by the IFC, it
would not be valid, said Tony
Spinola, IFC president.

The policies limiting the
number of brothers at “Meet the
Greeks” and the new five—to—
seven-day bid restriction will
begin in January when the new
IFC executive board takes office.

Second—round nominations and
an election will be held Nov. 27.

house to be involved with the

country that recognizes our hu-
man rights, and hopefully as stu-
dents we can show the world that
we're not apathetic and that we
do care about the rights of others,
and we want other people to re-
spect and honor them,” she said.

Hill said that it is important for
group members to remain active

throughout the year, not only
during Human Rights Week.

“I think it’s important for us to
continue to be involved and to
work on Amnesty’s mandate,
which is to free all prisoners of
conscience, to have fair trials for
all political prisoners and to end
torture and execution in all cases,
which includes the death penalty
in the United States,” said Hill.

“If your parents belong, you
can stay a member until you are

Class Two is for people ages 25

ages 30 to 35, and Class Four is
for people 35 and older. Classes
Five and Six are for non—resident
members who live over 30 and

Member of each class pays
different dues, depending on the
age and location of the member.

The club itself houses three
ﬂoors of rooms and suites for
overnight members and their
guests, including three floors of
banquet rooms, dining rooms
and bars. One of the suites is
called the Princess Grace Suite,
named after the late Princess
Grace of Monaco, because she

Researchers say lac/e of ozcceptotrzce, delays AIDS treatment

By Jennifer Skriba
suqr Writer

A Pitt research group has concluded that
AIDS and HIV-infe cted patients experience
difficulties in receiving the health—care
services and treatment that they need,
based on the results of a study completed
in October.

The study concentrated on the particular
health-care needs of people who have
AIDS or are HlV—positive throughout a
region in southwestern Pennsylvania which
encompassed Allegheny, Beaver, Fayette,
Washington and Westmoreland counties.

“The unique thing that we did was to
actually look at people without AIDS.
There is little information about what
services are utilized by people without
AIDS [but] who are infected [with HIV],’’
said research associate Sharon Zucconi,
Ph.D., the project director.

“We're very concerned how to develop
a regional plan here,” she said.

The 31-member project team consisted
of university researchers, members of AIDS
service groups and health—care providers
from hospitals and nursing homes who
compiled the information from multiple
perspectives.

The group surveyed health—care

providers to determine their perceptions
on how to improve the quality of care.
They also surveyed people with the HIV
infection and people with AIDS. Detailed
interviews of drug— and alcohol—treatment
providers, clergy and hospital-discharge
planners were conducted.

The group also did an organizational
analysis, looking at federal and state
government response and economic
analysis.

Currently, there are a number of services,
such as legal help, emergency funds,
buddy care and support groups, that are
available to people with HIV infection or
AIDS, but about 10 percent of these
people are unaware that these services
are available to them, according to Zucconi.

“They didn’t use [services] even though
they needed them because they didn’t
know they were available,” said Zucconi.

The team found that people with HIV
infection or AIDS confront barriers when
seeking medical treatment because of
limited accessibility and a lack of
acceptance.

“There was some difficulty we found in
the way AIDS patients perceived the
treatment by janitors, housekeeping staff
and the dietary staff,” said Zucconi.

The dietary staff would wear rubber

gloves while serving the meals or would
leave the tray for the patient outside the
door, he said.

The group found that once people get
access to the care they need, they are
satisfied with it. Much of the problem is
that people diagnosed HIV- positive have
extreme difficulty in finding a physician or
dentist willing to handle them.

Many dentists are unwilling to treat HIV-
positive clients, and people are reluctant
to reveal their HIV-positive status to the
dentist, the study reported.

There are, however, support services
designed to help infected clients to reveal
their HIV status and to help educate their
health—care providers, Zucconi said.

According to the client survey, few
people were dissatisfied with their hospital
care, and AIDS patients are more likely to
be admitted for inpatient care whether
they can pay for it or not but will attempt
to see a physician or dentist only when
funds are available.

The team concluded that it will cost
approximately $39,184 for the lifetime
care of an AIDS patient, which at this point
is estimated at 15 months.

Zucconi said she expects the costs to
continue to increase because of longer life
expectancies brought about by new drugs

used to prolong life. She said she wants“
the HIV clients to get into the health—care
system sooner, before they get AIDS.

About 40 percent of the AIDS patients
are on Medicaid; about 10 percent use
family money to pay for care, and the
remaining half have private insurance. But
as many of the AIDS patients get sicker,
they can no longer work, and they lose“
their insurance, Zucconi said.

Zucconi said that in the next few years,
over half of AIDS patients will be on
Medicaid.

The project team's major
recommendation is education at all levels.
They suggest education at the levels of
professional training in medical, dental

transcripts will be an advantage
of the ISIS system that will make
the search for academic
information faster, easier and
more accurate. The computers
will not have to search through
all of the possible selections that
satisfy a general-education

requirement to find a student’s
ID number. Instead, the computer
can call up the individual student’s
ID number and compare the
courses completed against a list
of courses that satisfy the
necessary requirements. This
ability will decrease the amount
of time necessary to register for

courses in coming years,
according to Burns.

Burns also said that having a
student’s academic record on line
will allow any necessary changes
to the transcripts to be made with
a relative amount of ease.

“There will be a lot less manual
maintenance to the system,” said

Burns. “We shouldn’t have a
problem like [the misinformation
on student academic-status
reports] again,” she said.

Burns said that the new system
is expected to be completed and
installed in late January, and that
it should be in effect for summer

Oakland untouched by Kahane’s death

 By Debbie Lincoln

Staff Writer

While the death of radical Jewish leader and
former Israeli parliament member Rabbi Meir
Kahane set off violence in Jerusalem, local Arab
and Jewish representatives said they are unaffected

- by Kahane’s assassination.

Kahane was assassinated Nov. 5 as he was
leaving a speaking en- ‘
gagement in Manhattan. 66
His assassin was Lel
Sayyid Nosair, a devout
Egy-ptian Muslim. Since
his relocation from New
York to Israel, Kahane
and his political party
Kach have consistently
advocated a policy of
forceful expulsion of all
Arabs from Israel and
the occupied territories.

which veryfew Jews or Israelis
agreed with, but I don’t think he

opinions, we will have blood all

Organization. It’s not rational. In Western norms,
you can’t understand-them  you can’t ﬁght them;
these people will do anything,” Rotem said.
Rotem said that when Kahane was elected in
1984 to the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, he
represented less than 1 percent of the Israeli
population. ~ F’
“You can't say he was a part of the Israeli political
system," said Rotem.

views, which very few
Jews or Israelis agreed
with, but I don’t think
he deserved to die. If
everyone has to die who
expresses his opinions,
we will have blood all

Muhammad Najjab,
an Arab Palestinian who
came to the United

-Amitai Rotem States in 1952, said the

graphy on Kahane,
author Robert Friedman
commented on Ka-
hane’s popularity, saying, “Although for now Kahane
cannot exercise political power, Israeli polls indicate
that his movement continues to thrive, undoubtedly
nourished by the Palestine uprising.”

Friedman quoted the rabbi as saying, “The Arabs
of Israel are a desecration in God’s name 
Removing them from the land is therefore more of
a political matter. It is a religious matter -—— a
religious obligation to wipe out the desecration in
God’s name.”

Arnitai Rotem, an Israeli emissary from the United
Jewish Federation in Oakland, feels that Kahane
and other religious fundamentalists are rapidly

rise to power as a threat to the region's stability.

problems of the region.

“The emotion is running even higher. This
[assassination] is just going to aggravate or stir up
the emotions more and deflect from finding a
peaceful solution [to the Arab—Israeli conflictl,"
Najjab said.

Najjab felt that the radical‘ leader did not accurately
symbolize Israeli goals.

“You’ll have within the Israeli society different
views," he said. “The Israeli system has apparently
rejected Kahane’s views. He was isolated within his
own system.”

Despite his opposition to the radical leader,
Najjab said, “I definitely abhor the idea that a man
had to die when all he was doing was expressing

Helsel said.

Before Helsel became co-

“This year we decided that we

The group has helped to

Prof compares sides
of censorship issue

By Chrissy Cullen
Stat)" Writer

Two opposing views of censorship were discussed at a
lecture in the Carnegie Museum of Art Theatre. -

“This forum is not meant for the advocacy of any idea,
posture or conviction. Ethics and serious reﬂection upon
ethical questions is fully fundamental for humans, whole
humans, living humans, ” said School of Library and Information
Science Dean Toni Bearman as she" introducedJohn R. Leo, the
main speaker. '

Leo, professor of literature and television studies at the
University of Rhode Island, focused on two extreme figures of
censorship. He talked about the work of Robert Mapplethorpe
and the controversy surrounding it, as well as Sen. Jesse Helms

‘ (R—N.C.) and his standpoint on this topic.

“Robert Mapplethorpe’s photographs of nudes give descriptive
representation of the body for minority and subcultural citing,
particularly those of gay men, S and M, black men and female
body builders. These bodies are reminders that they are
genderized in marginal ways by the dominant culture and all
its contradictions. They are mainly excluded from cultural,
political and legal representation,” Leo said.

Mapplethorpe’s work has been considered pornographic by
certain “moralists,” such as Helms. Some of his pictures are
thought of as indecent or as child pornography, such as his
1976 “Jesse McBride,” a picture of a naked little boy.

Mapplethorpe’s work went largely unnoticed until it was
displayed in Cincinnati. After going to trial, the director of the
museum where the art was exhibited was acquitted, but seven
pictures were removed from the collection. ‘

Leo said that some senators, such as Helms, have publicly
calledMapplethorpe’s work obscene. Leo said that Helms has
suggested that the art be banned.

Leo's talk was part of the SLIS Dean’s Forum on the Ethics
of Information in Society. It was the second lecture of this
session. The talk was co-hosted by the Carnegie Library.

Sto re bans CD boxes

The packaging boxes that compact discs are sold in are useless,
outdated and wasteful, according to Paul C. Mawhinney, owner of
Record Rama in North Hills.

The long cardboard boxes used to package CD5 were originally
used to help stop pilfering because a larger box is harder to conceal,
said Mawhinney. But Mawhinney saw no change in the number of
thefts when his store stopped using the boxes.

The large record chains don’t want to spend the money to replace
the shelves and accommodate CDs without the boxes, Mawhinney
said.

Mawhinney said that aside from the environmental concern to
decrease excess packaging, he wants to better serve the customer. At
Record Rama, a customer can read the inserts supplied with the
recording, and the customer can listen to a recording before buying
it. A

In 1985 Record Rama contained the largest collection_ of vinyl
records in the world but also began selling CDs to keep up with the
changes in the recording industry, Mawhinney said. Part of the
change included new shelves designed specifically for CD5, he
added.

Peace com get results...

It’s not often when a group of high school students can
have more of an effect on a national government than an
equal number of college students. This, however, has
been the case this week in France. ,

Approximately 150,000 high school students
demonstrated throughout France, many in Paris itself,
against the government to protest poor conditions in the

»country’s 4,700 schools.

Late last month, a high school student was raped in a
Paris suburb. Since then, students have been protesting
the conditions of the schools, calling for better safety. This
led to more general demands, such as increasing the
number of teachers and schools to relieve overcrowding.

Although the protest in Paris eventually turned into a riot

in which 50 people were injured, the demonstrations were

mainly peaceful. When college students protest, however,
violence is more prevalent.

In this case, the high school students got what they asked
for.. French President Francois Mitterand called for an
“emergency plan” to investigate the problems behind the
students’ complaints. Conditions improvements are to be
discussed between the students and Education Minister
Lionel Jospin.

Because of their peaceful movement, the student cause
is widely supported throughout the country, not only by
citizens but by local governments as well.

Unfortunately, many college students during their rallies
turn to violence as a method to get policies changed. This
rally proved that this method of protest is unnecessary to
make changes.

Pitt students could take a lesson from these students. The
last time college students made noise about something, it
turned out to be a riot in California where students had just
drank too much and wanted to make a scene.

Many people on this campus feel that they are powerless
to do anything. But they do not realize that the power of
assembly is a very powerful force in the world, as proven
in this recent demonstration. If Pitt students feel strongly
about something, go to the President's office and complain.
Show the administration that the student body cares.

The results could be very surprising.

The tense, depressed ‘features
of Rep. Doug Walgren (D-Pa.)
floated across the television
screens placed in the Elk Room
of the Greentree Holiday Inn,
and everyone at the party knew
it was all over. A great chorus of

whoops, cheers and applause

rang out as the campaign staffers
and volunteers in the room
celebrated the surprise election
of 32-year-old Rick Santorum to
Congress from the 18th District,
encompassing much of Allegheny
County. Minutes later, I along
with several other students from
Pitt who had helped in this
campaign, watched as a tearful
Santorum acknowledged
Walgren’s concession and
thanked everyone who had
helped to bring about this
stunning upset.

Over 2,000 people had
volunteered at some time and in
some capacity to the Santorum
campaign, and it is probably
accurate to say that this was the
pivotal difference in a race won
by only about 4,500 votes.
Certainly all volunteers in the
campaign went away from the
victory party believing that they,
in some way, directly contributed
to a Santorum victory. Some had

were satisﬁed that they had
become involved and had helped
a candidate who believed in many
of the things they did.

I think this example, certainly
one that impressed me deeply,
should answer the question
people who care deeply about
issues invariably ask: Can one
person actually make a difference?
In a race this close, every voter
counted, and every volunteer who

counted. Walgren, who attempted
to build grass-roots support
several weeks before the election
(whereas Santorum had been
working more than a year) can
certainly attest to this fact. One
person can indeed make a
difference, and a group of people
who share this belief is a force to
be reckoned with.

With this clearly in mind, I am
bothered that so many students
here at Pitt as well as people in
the community in general only
work at their own problems and

  

    

for their own petty interests.

Precious few of us work in,

political campaigns and causes
— if that is our talent —— or for
charities, social agencies, service
organizations or anything! And
while this is a tragedy for all of
these organizations and activities
that need such work, the greater
tragedy is that the wonderful
opportunity for personal growth
and fulfillment these provide is
not utilized by those who really
need it. .

Someday I can look back at my
days at Pitt and be proud of the
things I did here. I will also be
able to recognize how it changed
me as a student and a person —
next term I will be changing my
major from , biochemistry to
political science and economics.
Will most of the readers of this
column be able to say the same,
or will they merely be able to
state that they got their degrees
and decent jobs afterwards?

Get involved. The rewards you
receive are priceless; the good
you can do is incalculable. One
person can indeed make a big
difference. One only has to look
at a young candidate nobody
thought would win to see that.

The transformers...

Dan Marino (Dolphins), Burt Grossman (Chargers) and Tom Ricketts (Steelers) are three of Pitt's more renowned football alumni.

‘ By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

For years, the question of football
players’ graduation rates and their success
in the working world has been raised time

\, and time again to determine the

effectiveness of a university's academic
program in relation to its student athletes.

But truth to tell, many college football
players’ dreams are not to carry a briefcase
for the rest of their lives. Many of these
physically gifted individuals want to break
into the National Football League, hoping
one day to secure a spot on a professional
roster and to obtain one of those lucrative

1., contracts which have come to characterize

professional sports in the modern era.

And NCAA football is the major gateway to
the pros.

With this in mind, instead of determining
football players’ success in graduation or
the ensuing world of 9 to 5, the following
depicts players’ success in the ultimate
goal of many college football athletes: the
opportunity to play in the NFL. In other
words, the success of the player’s education
provided on the gridiron instead of the
classroom.

As a basis, three schools which belong
to the Big East conference and currently
have active Division I football programs
were used for comparison. Pittsburgh,
Boston College and Syracuse were rated,
based on three categories, to determine
the success of their football programs in

placing athletes into the pros—the number
of former collegiate players currently in
the NFL, the number of first-round draft
choices selected since 1980 and the current
number of starters on pro teams.

And a potential football player who is
interested in one of the Big East schools
and who is also seeking to play pro ball
someday may want to give Pitt some
serious thought.

Among the three schools, Pitt has been
the most successful in placing athletes into
the NFL. Currently, Pitt boasts 44 former
Panthers who have made the rosters of
NFL teams. Boston College ranks second
with 22, and Syracuse brings up the rear
with 16.

“Obviously, we’re getting pretty good

athletes in our program, and it's fairly
obvious that they’ve been coached well,”
said Pitt athletic director Ed Bozik. “Those
two elements are a reﬂection of Pitt
tradition, and kids look at that and put a lot
of store in it."

Pitt also holds the honor of the most
first-round draft picks in the last decade
with 14. Most notably, Hugh Green
(linebacker, Tampa Bay, 1981), Jim Covert
(tackle, Chicago, 1983), Dan Marino (QB,
Miami, 1983), Chris Doleman (LB,
Minnesota, 1985), Bill Fralic (T, Atlanta,
1985), Craig Heyward (running back, New
Orleans, 1988), Burt Grossman (Defensive
end, San Diego, 1989) and Tom Ricketts
(T, Steelers, 1989).

Former‘Pz'z‘t swimmer on course for 1992 ,Olympz'c trials

Byjim Lakely
Staff Writer

For three years, Mike Kozlina
labored in Trees Pool, continuing
the tradition of excellent Panther
swimmers. His hard work and
incredible talent added his name
to the list of record holders
hanging on the wall. And though
his days of swimming for Pitt are
over, his presence is still felt by
the team. It is not merely the
ghost of past glories that remains
to inspire this year’s squad.
Coach Mike Kozlina has stepped

in where swimmer Mike Kozlina
left off. _

Last year he was captain of
the swim team. His hard work
and dedication was an
inspiration to his teammates.
And though he will never swim
with his old teammates in
collegiate competition again, he
is with them as a graduate
assistant coach. Kozlina is going
for his master's degree in mental
health for social work, and when
he is not studying, he is in the
pool, training for the 1992
Olympic trials.

- Kozlina had back surgery in
1986 to remove a herniated disk.
The injury didn't slow down his
collegiate career, but recently
he injured his back again while
running the stadium steps, part
of his training for the Olympic
trials. He didn't swim much this
summer, and until his back
started bothering him, his
swimming improved more than
at any point in his career.

“It’s an on-and-off sort of
thing,” he said. “I still feel young
enough to swim. I still think my
fastest swim is ahead of me. In

fact, I know it is. I keep getting
stronger each year, and [head
coach Chuck Knoles’] new
training program is a great
change."

Kozlina is an in-the-water
coach, something that few swim
teams are fortunate enough to
have. While Knoles and assistant
coach Mark Davin pace the deck
during practices, Kozlina is in
the water, giving personal
attention to the swimmers.

“He gives us a coach who can
motivate in the water, and that
kind of coach is hard to find,‘

said Knoles. “Mike’s strength
lies in his past experiences as an
NCAA qualiﬁer. He helps the
swimmers realize their goals.”
“I try to be the catalyst for the
team, to lead by example —— I
guess that’s my job,” said
Kozlina, who seems to down-
play his importance to the team.
The swimmers like the fact that
he will be around for a while.
“We see him busting his ass to‘
make the Olympics, so it
motivates us to work harder,”
said freshman Tony Frassetto.

Women ’s Hoops

kicks off season

By Rob Mazur “
Staff Writer

Well, sports fans, as football season nearsnits end, basketball
is just beginning. The University of Pittsburgh men’s team
kicked off its exhibition with Marathon Oil on Nov. 1, but the
women took slightly longer to swing into action. They kicked
off their season on Nov. 8 with a 73-69 exhibition win against
Athletes in Action.

" The game marked the return of the Lady Panthers’ star
forward Lorri Johnson. Johnson, the Panthers’ leading scorer
last season, was declared academically ineligible earlier this
year. Her absence left the team with major question marks as
to who would step forward to ﬁll the void. Johnson appealed
the decision, however, and won. Regaining her eligibility
greatly improves the team’s chances to win the Big East.

Johnson was not Pitt’s main focus in this game, however.
“We wanted to take a look at our new freshmen and see how
they played,” said Coach Kirk Bruce. “Some of them did not

- play as much as others did, but everyone saw playing time, and

that was our goal for this game.

Hockey club cruises past CMU-

By John Labriola
Sta_[}“W1~iter

The Pitt Panther hockey club celebrated its
season home opener this past weekend by crushing
cross-campus rival Carnegie Mellon, 11-2 at the
Golden Mile Ice Center.

Offensively, the Panthers were led by center
Eugene Barrilla, who chalked up one goal and one
assist, and left wing Bill Crousey, who tallied four
goals and one assist.

“At the moment, Crousey and Barrilla are our
strongest players,” said Dave Koval, the club’s
president. “They are unstoppable.”

According to Koval, Crousey and Barrilla are able
to take the pressure off the third forward, which
allows him to set up the play and score. This
offensive strategy worked against the Tartans
throughout the game. During the first period the
Panthers sent in 26 shots on goal, four of which hit
their mark, while the rest were saved by goaltender
Dave Sealton.

“We had them from the start,” said Koval. “Their
goaltender was extremely good.”

The Pitt squad has always been an offensive-
minded team, but it has always had excellent

 

The Panthers are keeping ﬁve goaltenders on the
team this year. Once again, Pitt fans will see a
familiar face in goal with Mark D’Arnico.

D’Arnico has been with the team for the past
three years, but he has been playing hockey with
Pitt for the last 12 years.

“Mark is the backbone of our goalies,” said Koval.

The Panther defense was able to hold the T artans
to only 10 shots on goal, a tremendous improvement
on last weekend’s 106 shots on the Pitt goal over
two games.

This weekend the Panthers will be hosting the
Allegheny College Gators at Golden M ile Ice Center.
The game is scheduled for 4 p.m.

“I think that our offense will put 10 goals on the
board,” said Koval, “but our defense will be there
to cover them.”

PI'lT BITS: The Panthers’ record now stands at 2-
0 in the Western Pennsylvania College Hockey
Association and 2-1 overall. Junior Eric Rotthoff
scored the first goal of his collegiate career against
CM. Koval, Kip Linse and John Carlins will return
to the ice this weekend after serving a one—game
suspension for ﬁghting. In three games the Panthers
have accumulated 24 penalties for a total of 103

“It’s great having him around,”

V said junior swimmer Mike Pﬁster.

“He gives a lot of emotional
support to the team.”

Kevin McLaughlin swims the
individual medley and when he

, needed help with his weakest

stroke, the backstroke, Kozlina
was there to help.

“He has really helped me,”
McLaughlin said. “He has given
me a lot of special attention and
showed me that he really does
care.”

All swimming instruction aside,
perhaps Kozlina’s greatest
contribution is the role of go-
between with the swimmers and
the coaches. Sometimes it is easier
for members of the teamto talk to
Kozlina than to new Panther
coaches Knoles and Davin.

“I am more of a teammate. If
they want to talk to Chuck or
Mark about something, they might
talk to me first. I try to be more
[their friendl.” .

According‘ to the members of
the team, Kozlina has assessed
his role on the team correctly.

“It’s great,” said Frassetto. “He
can really relate to us and can tell
the coaches how we feel. It is
easier to talk to him.”

“We have to take him more
seriously,” said McLaughlin. “Last
year he was just a friend and
teammate. He is still a friend, but
now in the pool we have to treat
him as an authority.”

Gaining the respect of the
coaches and the swimmers came
pretty easily to Kozlina, but
watching the meets from the deck
is a lot harder.

“I feel left out,” Kozlina said. “I
wish I had another year or two,
but it’s not like I’m done forever.
l’ve got ’92.”

Surprisingly, he sees 1992 as
the end of his swimming career.
No more swimming. No more
coaching. No more long days.

“It was fun while it lasted, but
when I’m done after ’92, I’m
done —— coaching, swimming —
everything. Three days a week of
getting up at 6 a.m. make your
days real long. I just want a job
where I can get up at 8 a.m., go
to work at 9, and go home at S
p.m. At least for a few years.
Swimming is just something I
want to put behind me. I need a
change.”

Kozlina may need a change,
but as long as he is still involved
with Pitt swimming, the tradition
of excellence that he helped to
continue will never change.

‘V-Ball blows by West Virginia

By Ryan Buncher
Sta1fFVriter

The Pitt volleyball team won its
ﬁnal match of the regular season
Monday night at West Virginia in
three easy games, by scores of

“P15-2, 15-2 and 155, posting Pitt's

  
    
 
 
  
    

season record at 27-5.

“The team played very well,”
said Pitt Coach Sue Woodstra.
“We executed very well and made
very few mistakes.”

The Lady Panthers had a kill

percentage of .422 compared to a
paltry -.018 for West Virginia.
Junior middle hitter Dee
MacAuley led Pitt in kills with
eight, and junior outside hitter
Linda Zols was tops on the team
in digs with 13. Senior co-captain
Jenelle Lantagne had a kill
percentage of 1.000 to go along
with 25 assists.

The team will play in the Big
East Tournament this weekend at
Providence, R.I. It enters the
tournament as the top seed after

having a perfect 7-0 record against
Big East teams in the regular
season. Only Syracuse and
Georgetown were able to take
the Lady Panthers beyond three
games. Pitt is the only team in the
Big East ranked in the Top 20 in
the country.

Pitt will play Villanova (18-17)
Saturday morning at 11:30. The
Wildcats did not win a Big East
match this year. If the Lady
Panthers win, they will face the
winner of the match pitting Seton
Hall (26-9, 5-4 in the Big East)
against Boston College (16-18, 3-
4). The ﬁnal match will be Sunday
at 2 pm.

“Syracuse [33-9, 6-1] is tough,
and of course, Georgetown [25-
13, 5-2] is improved this year,”
said Woodstra of Pitt’s competition
this weekend. “A lot of the teams
in the Big East are improved this
year. If we are down one day, any
of them can takeus." Syracuse’s
only Big East loss of the season
was a four-game loss to Pitt in the

Syracuse tournament.

When asked if she was happy
with the team's position going
into the postseason, Woodstra
said, “Yes. After the West Virginia
match, we are definitely on the
upswing.”

One key to Pitt's postseason
success will be the health of the
players. The team has been down
to as few as seven players at
times this season. Knee surgery
ended freshman middle hitter
Carrie Thornton's season early in
the year. Freshman outside hitter
Ann Marie Lucanie returned to
action this past weekend after
sitting out since Oct. 6 with an
ankle injury. She played only on
the back line Friday against Penn
State but has been playing full
games since.

“She’s right on schedule,"
Woodstra said. “She has had no
setbacks. She’s doing well. We
are going to take it one step at a
time with her.”

NFL

The Miami Hurricanes.

Continued from page 7
Pitt has had a first-round pick in the draft in eight of the last

10 years, and both Boston College and Syracuse are far behind,
with five and four first-round picks in the last decade, respectively. »

“For better or for worse, a lot of kids come here, and their
primary objective is to be professional football players, and I
hope they all are. The odds are no — they’re not going to be.
But we’re a little higher with the percentages,” Bozik said.

“It all starts with the kids you bring in, and you have to have
capable athletes, or you're not going to succeed.”

Pitt heads the number of NFL starters also, coming in with 14
players currently. The most highly recognized names include
Marino, Covert, Fralic and Doleman.

Syracuse comes in second, with eight players starting, including
Anderson, Rob Moore (N .Y. Jets) and Art Monk (Washington).
BC again brings up the rear, with only two players starting (Iohn
Bosa of Miami and Joe Wolf of Phoenix).

“Our coaches have obviously been recruiting well over the
past 10 or 12 years, and they obviously must be teaching our
kids something. When kids look at Penn State, Notre Dame,
Southern Cal or wherever, they’re looking at the kind of success
the programs have of putting kids into the pros".

Pitt may be basking in the sun after leading other Big East
schools in every category which is a reﬂection of a gridiron
education, but there is still a conference merger in the future
involving Pitt, BC, Syracuse and another major addition thatwill
rewrite the football education books.

Hoops

Continued from page 8
saw where we have to make
some adjustments in the lineup,”
he added. '

Indeed, the women did not
have any real problems putting
away their opponents. The Lady
Panthers led by as many as 17
points in the second half en route
to the win. After that, they began
using different combinations with

first—year players late in the game.
This kind of experience gives the
new players a pressure situation

to play in without having to worry '

about a loss counting against the
team.

The Lady Panthers open their
19,90-91 regular season at
Fitzgerald Field House on Friday,
Nov. 25 against St. Francis at 7:30
