Three Class

‘Presidents

John Bender, John Grimes,
and Carl Slesinger are the
freshman presidents of the
College, Engineering, and
B u s i n e s s Administration
schools respectively.

These three students won out
over 49 other political aspirants
from the class of 1960. The ballot-
ing was featured by close races in
all three ‘schools.

In the College, John Strauch

«W, captured the runner-up spot of

vice—president; and Mark Elovitz,
the third highest vote-getter, as-
sumes the position of secretary.
T_he freshman College treasurer
is Robert DiCicco, \ and the ﬁfth
man is David Brea‘-istone.
Vice-president of the school of
Engineering and Mines is Fred
Mendicino. The rest of the ex-
ecutive board includes secretary,
Joe Avoli; treasurer, Raymond
Sierka; and ﬁfth man, James
Eckenrode. A
Besides electing Slesinger as the
head of their class, Business Ad-
ministration students put John
Spear in the vice-presidential of-

.._g,.,,,..-fice and elected Howard Stewart

’ secretary. Ted Noethling received
the fourth highest number of votes
and will be treasurer, while Harry
Taylor will serve as the ﬁfth man.

In all, 80 per cent of the fresh-
man men cast ballots for the can-
didates of their choices as com-
pared to a 30 per cent turnout two
years ago. The voting this year was
held in all Men’s Conference
classes. «

British Summer School

Described By Delegate

By MILLARD AMDUR
Dennis Ward described the British summer school pro-
gram at a meeting of the Scottish Room Committee, Nov. 2,
in the Scottish Nationality Room. Ward came to Pittsburgh
as a representative of the joint British university summer
schools and as an ambassador from the Scottish summer

school.

Ward said, at the meeting, that¢

when he came to the United States,
he was “staggered by the speed,
trafﬁc, and pace of things in New
York.” He expected Pittsburgh to
be a quiet country town.

On the topic of the evening,
Ward said, the summer school is
a deﬁnite asset to Anglo-Ameri- ‘
can relations. The student who
returns from study in a British
summer school becomes a pub-

' lie-relations man from Britain.

The British university academic
system contains “tutorials,” small
discussion groups that allow the
student to meet for a maximum of
three and a half hours with a
“tutor.” Although Americans ﬁnd
it strangetat ﬁrst, Ward said, they
soon join in the discussions with
even more zeal than other stu-
dents.

Attending a British summer
school allows foreigners to be-
come acquainted with the British
way of life.

The University of Birming-
ham offers a summer school
course, “Shakespeare and Eliza-

stitute of Certiﬁed Public , Ac-
countants, is open to all students
planning accounting as a profes-
sion. ~

Pubiic accounting in the local

each ﬁeld. Following these dis-
cussions, a social hour will be
held in the social room of the
Memorial which will give stu-
dents an opportunity to meet

Here We Go Again

Students seem to have the wrong idea about the reasons
for class dismissal for football rallies. The administration
and faculty are not permitting the regular academic sched-
ule to be upset so that a few who really care about the
football team can attend the assemblies. The assemblies are
for all students who are attending the University. The dis-
missal is not granted for the use of those who want to shuf-
ﬁe through the Tuck Shop lines and add their smoke and
hot air to the atmosphere.

It was stated earlier in the year that a better turnout
must be seen at pep assemblies or the schedule of dismissed
hours would be retracted and no further assemblies would
be held under official sanction of the University.

This decision may be an eﬁective one on the part of
the administration. As it is now, the rallies may have a
negative effect on team spirit. It would be better for the

administration to outlaw assemblies completely than to

have the team sit on the corner of the stage at So1dier’s
Memorial and look at thousands of empty seats. .

Attendance at some games has also been noticeably
poor. This action on the part of the students indicates a
lack of pride for the ﬁne record of the team. It is very
fortunate for the school that admission is very nominal for
students. If attendance depended on those few_ who follow
the team through thick and thin, the University would ap-
pear to deemphasize football through lack of student sup-
port. .

If fraternities and sororities are ready for a scrap when
there is the hint that Homecoming events are questioned
and if every student, Greek or Independent, has a gripe
about a bad performance on the part of the team, then
some of these second-guessers should do their part of the
game winning. They can do what the University——team, ad-

- ministration, everyone——expects them to do. They can at-

tend rallies and games to show their support and enthusiasm
for Pitt’s contribution a great American sport.

'A Tiring Period . . .

Glad It's

By Ed Bachman

I was among the many millions who were glad
to see Nov. 6 come and go. This 1956 National
election period was grueling, tiring, many times
ridiculous, but at the same time rewarding, inter-
esting and absorbing.

The four major candidates worked long and
strenuous hours and deserve a much-needed rest.
But for the two winners, Dwight
Eisenhower and Dick Nixon, a
diverting vacation is not possi-
ble, what with demanding atten-
tion necessary toward such
troubled spots as the Middle
East and Hungary.

The candidates clearly show-
ed their relief that the campaign
was at a close, whether they
were the winners or the defeated.
A weary misty-eyed Eisenhower early last Wed-
nesday morning, gave an acceptance‘-victory speech

that acknowledged public support of “modern Re--

publicanism,” but it is not hard to see that Ameri-
cans mainly supported the man and not the party
at the recent election. Ike, the great American
hero, was re—elected by an astounding avalanche
of support, but he is a president who will have

‘ an opposition-controlled Congress.

Adlai Stevenson, the crushed Democratic stand-
ard-bearer, is now dead politically. He waged a
strange (for him) campaign; that of a man des-
perate for the job of presidency. In his desperation,
the former Illinois governor sacriﬁced much ofshis

 

 

  

high ethics and principles. But at 1:20 a.m. last
Wednesday, when he conceded, Adlai was again a
man to be truly respected. During his superb con-
cession speech before national TV and radio, he.
was again a man to be looked up to and admired.
This was the Stevenson of old. But it came too
late. Seventy million citizens had already made
their choice. _

In addition to Stevenson, it is our feeling that
quite a few other politicians suffered political
elimination. The old war—horse Harry Truman for
one. In his losing battle to, dump Stevenson from
the top of the ’56 ticket, the ex-president created
much animosity within the Democratic party. But
Harry was a bit of a prophet at that. ‘On Aug. 14,
1956, he was quoted in the Baltimore Sun, “I don’t
think Stevensonucan win a single state in addition

to what he did in l952.” Adlai carried nine States.‘

i 

in 1952; only seven this year.

Another ﬁgure to drop in future major politi-
cal happenings is Estes Kefauver. The Tennessee.
senator is in the Democratic dog—house for his type

  

All Over    

of campaigning; that of distorting facts and dis-» .

agreeing with Stevenson on policy.

So the campaign is over and Stevenson and
Kefauver have fallen~to the rousing vote of con-
ﬁdence to Eisenhower and Nixon. It is easy now
for critics of Adlai to look back to a pre-1952 con-
vention statement by the now twice-defeated can-
didate. Stevenson may have been too certain in
his own mind when he said of the presidency, “I

have no ﬁtness for the job, temperamentally, men-reg“ .

Made 'em Laugh . . 

The Man Who Came To Dinner

By Irv Jacobs

The uncontrolled laughter em-
anating from Stephen Foster
Memorial last weekend did not
well up unguided. It was at all
times in the control of Larry
Heller and Co. in their hilarious
presentation of “The Man Who
Came To Dinner.”

This feature of seizing control
of an audience’s funnybone is
perhaps the essential element of
the entire play. Though its pur-
pose may be construed to be
that of exposing the “inside life”
of celebrities in the entertain-
ment world, the glimpse that it
gives is so grossly exaggerated

that perhaps the play’s value.

may be measured simply in its
ability to make people laugh. A
better setting could not have
been devised, however, for
stimulating such free flow of
laughter. '

A Paradoxical Nature

Larry Heller, in ‘the title role,
does an outstanding job in pre-
senting the many facets of the
perverse Whiteside personality.
In depicting a character that can
be both brutal and generous,
Heller had a tremendous job cut
out for himself. Indeed, White-
side was so paradoxical in ‘na-
ture that Heller can be justiﬁed
in his occasional lapses from ac-
curate dramatization — as in his
insincere soliloquoy in favor of

the Crowﬁeld Home for Paroled
Criminals. He was especially ef-
fective in reeling off the colorful

rinvective of Whiteside, and in

demonstrating the mannerisms
and perverted resourcefulness of
this difficult character.

Dick Harshberger as the
thwarted Mr. Stanley, does an
accurate job in conveying the
discomfort and helplessness of
coping with the imposing White-
side. His wife, played by Jean

Kelly, is well representative ‘too, »

of a meekly, adulative woman

who knows not the dif’ference=

between an honor and being
taken.

Shrewd Maggie Cuttler,
Whiteside’s V secretary, though
eventually capturing the admir-
ation of her audience, slips
momentarily in her dramatiza-
tion of a girl in love. Maggie,
played by Mary Johnson, is ap-
parently so hardened to the
wily ways of Whiteside’s world
that she fails to convey this first
true feeling she has ever felt.
Her suitor, though, played by
Jack Joy, is effective at all times,
even in the difficult’ drunken

‘ scene.

Pair of ‘Itchy’ Entrants

Perhaps the most hilarious
characters in the play are __the

I “peculiar” friends of Whiteside,

all of whom do noteworthy jobs.
Professor Mattuci, played by

tally or physically.” . ‘

Allen Borelli, and Beverly Carl-
ton, played by Bob Feldman,

‘s.

were a pair of “itchy,” but most .

- refreshing entrants on the stage.

And Banjo, by Paul Mooney,
presented an unearthly char-
acter, describable only as fluid
domedy. In his heroic role, he
was especially typical

Lorraine Sheldon’s pecularities
were uproarious, though unfor-
tunately the most notable ones
could be suggested only by the
“raunchy? dialogue. I

Of an exaggerated cast, the
role of Dr. Bradley had the dis-
tinction of being the most ex-
aggerated. The versatile writer
and part—time doctor did 'an ade-
quate job in entertaining the
play’s audiences, at the expense
of the AMA. I

And, though Nurse Prim ulti-

in his ’ W
“crawling to the rescue.” Even‘/‘

mately disappoints a noble pro- .

fession too, she does a noble job
in providing the element of sob-x-
erness without which the play’s?»
humor could not have emerged.
Innocent little Harriet, a puz-
zling character throughout the
play, justiﬁed her awkard pres-,
ence in providing the great anti-
climatic laugh of the play. Ably
handled by Edithann Waldorf,
this sudden exposure had the

‘symbolic purpose of adding the

proverbial kitchen sink to an
a l r e a d y tubful of shocking
laughs. v

. Letters to the Editor

Editor, the Pitt News:

May an alumnus (BS Col. ’43)
with somewhat divided loyalties
since doing graduate work at
Minnesota (MS ’49 and PhD ’51)
express one man’s appreciation
for the magnificent job that the
Pitt squad did here last Satur-
day. This state is football crazy,
and understandably taken with
the performance to date of their
beloved Gophers. Nevertheless,
I have seldom heard such ex-
pression of admiration for an
opponent’s performance as was

, the case following the Pitt game.
There is little feeling here that
Minnesota was a better team,
rather much the more fortunate
one. Be that as it may, Coach
Warmath commented last night

that this was the toughest game ‘

he has had since arriving in

Minnesota three years ago.

As one who does not subscribe
to the prevalent opinion around
here that midwest football is
superior to ‘any other, it was
satisfying to witness the whole-
sale respect for Pitt which was
everywhere ‘apparent. Althoﬁgh
the Panthers lost, some of us ex-
patriates will ﬁnd the-climate of
opinion out here much more to
our taste than was the case pre-
viously.

The partisan crowds at Goph-
er football games contrast sharp-
ly with the more cosmopolitan
fans I remember at Pittsburgh.
Pitt people might better appre-
ciate the magnitude of their
team’s effort against a ﬁrst~class
Minnesota squad (perhaps the
best they’ve ever had) if they

could witness the terriﬁc impact a

of such partisan sentiment in a‘
packed stadium, especially’ at
homecoming.

With each passing year, Pitt
grads-have more reason to be

. proud of their school. Her more

lasting achievements in educa-
tion and research are increasing-
ly addipg lustre to her ‘name.
But let’s face it —- in a football-
whacky state like Minnesota,
where even modest achieve-.
ments of the football Gophers
can temporarily o v e r shadow
their ﬁne University’s academic
triumphs, the Pitt Panthers

made a terrific impression--and
all favorable.-

May the breaks even up from
here on in for a truly great,
well-coached Pittsburgh teaml.

Sincerely ' . .
‘ J. W. Butcher

Offense-Minded Cadets
Next Test For Gridders

By ED KOLTISKA
Army’s high-scoring Cadets will provide the opposition
for the Panther’s annual Homecoming event at the Stadium
this Saturday afternoon beginning at 1:30 p.m.
With rumors mentioning the possibilities of a post-season

trip to the Cotton Bowl for the¢

Jungle Cats, this fray with the
Cadets will prove to be a big one.
Last year the Oaklanders found
themselves in a similar position.
With a 5-3 record prior to the
West Virginia tilt, a victory over
the Mountaineers virtually as-
sured them a Sugar Bowl bid.

Reserves Need Experience

This year Army provides the
hurdle. Coach John Michelosen,
well aware of this, has his aides
washing out the kinks in the of-
fense.

Line coach Jack Wiley is also
optimistic about his line’s de-
fensive play. “Although they
played a good game defensively,
some of the reserves need a lit-
tle more experience to plug the
gap against teams like Army
and Penn State,” commented
Wiley.

The Cadets who have one of the
ﬁnest offensive teams in the coun-
try have scored 149 points in their
last three games.

A In contrast, the Jungle Cats.
O

have scored only 101 points in
their last seven contests. The ser-
ies totaling only ﬁve games shows
the Panthers in the driver’s seat
with four wins to one loss.

Leading the Cadet offense is
ex-quarterback, now converted
to a. fullback, Bob Kyasky.
Army Coach Red Blaik accredits
their latest scores to the hard
running of Kyasky.

Coach Michelosen is very high
on the running ability of Kyasky
by stating, “It seems that every
time that boy gets ’hold of the
ball he runs for a touchdown.”

Panther Backs Fast

Another scoring threat bolster-
ing the Cadet attack is a local
boy, Dick Murtland of Greensburg.
In the 1955 season, Murtland aver-
aged 6.6 yards per carry while
scoring four touchdowns and ﬁve
extra points.

The Panthers will match the
Cadet ofiense with some light, but
speedy, backs in Corky Cost, Jim

Selling electric equipment for a utility sub-
station—-a complex unit used in power trans-
mission and distribution—requires extensive
technical knowledge of the products in-
volved. Men who sell such complex equip-
ment must also know a customer’s require-
ments, what will best ﬁll his needs, and how
to sell the merits of their products to the
executives who buy such apparatus.

One such man at General Electric is 31-
year-old Allen J. Clay, an apparatus sales
engineer serving the electrical utility com-
panies in.-the Philadelphia-Allentown area.

For Clay, technical selling is not a door-to-
door job. As a representative of General
Electric, he must be ready to discuss cus-
tomer needs with vice presidents or help
solve intricate problems with skilled engi-
neers. His recommendations are based on
his own engineering background, and are
backed up by the know-how of the Com-
pany’s best application engineers. His in-
terest in working with people‘ carries over
