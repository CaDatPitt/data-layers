 Pitt Crisis Prompts March Action,

Legislature Ups Appropriation $2 ’Million; A

‘ -Baum Urges Continued Student Pressure:

_ HARRISBURG-—The State House of Rep_-
resentatives and the State Senate passeda bill _
yesterday which would give the University an
additional $2 million when the. state allocations

are given out the state.

This additional amount, which was mis-
takenly cut from the'University’s allocation
; last fall, will raise from $37 million to $39 mil-
lion ‘theamount the University will receive.
(This is for the budget fiscal year beginning

July 1, 1969.) '

‘Although Penn State University also will
receive additional funding in the form of an
increased allocation, Temple University will
‘receive the same amount, $41 million, that it
i had been scheduled for allocation before.
_ Although this additional $2 million was tack-
ed onto the'-University’s appropriation from
thefstate, legislation which will raise enough
.t_axes'to pay the actual money promised in the
_ appropriation was still.not passed. '
New tax bills, mostly in the form of utility
taxes, were introduced, but the voting will not
. take place for a few days. No legislation calling
fora state income tax was introduced yester-
day.,Ma,ny members of the House seemed con--
fident that between budget cuts and the tax
proposals on the floor, some kind of agreement
- -rmay be reached‘ soon, and the budget for fis-
' ‘cal year 1969 will be approved and funded. .

Baum and Steve Sundra, present SG presi-
dent, extended their Tuesday visi.t and may re-'
vmain in Harrisburg tomorrow if no legislation
is passed today. Baum indicated that the per-
sonal contact with the legislators may be the?
pressure needed on that front to impress legis-'
lators of the seriousness of the situation.

According to Baum, the legislators have
reacted favorably_to the manv letters they have
received from students.’ “They were very im-.
pressed by the fact that students andlparents
applied‘ pressure within the normal channels‘
of the government,” Baum said.- 7

The ad hoc student committee studying the
financial crisis asked Baumto ‘obtain a parade
permit for the proposed Mar_ch 9. march on
"Harrisburg while he is there. Inaddition, Bauml
is to look into the possibility‘ of meetings with-

’ legislators on March 9 ‘while the students ‘are .

In reference to the march, Baum-comment-'

car riders and bus riders. They
will then attempt to facilitate all

s members of the community desir-
; ing transportation to Harrisburg,‘

in the least expensive manner.

»The workers stressed two areas '

ofconcern during the meeting:
“First, they notedithat the march
«was being designed “in order for

‘ _ the people of Pennsylvania to con-

front their legislature.” They ex-
plained that one of the members
of the group, Scott Baum, former

‘~ Student Government president,

was‘ ‘in. Harrisburg trying  to, ob-

. taina parade -permit. They also

said that the march would be mar-
‘ shalled in a ‘maximum attempt

Vietnamese Representative

Phuong Urges Peace

by DANA M. VENTRIGLIA
Staff Writer

Miss Cao Ngoc Phuong, a rep-
resentative of the Overseas Viet-
namese Buddhist Association, dis-
cussed a peace proposal that was
adopted during a conference of
Vietnamese Buddhists on Sunday
at the University and City Minis-
tries.

According to the sponsors, the
proposal “may represent the de-
sire for peace bv a “silent major-
ity” of Southl/i‘et_namese,-so many
of whom have been exiled, impris-
oned. or harshly suppressed by the
Saigon government.

Miss Phuong, a former teacher
at Saigon Univer_sity, commented
on her country’s political situation
and living conditions and urged a
unilateral cease—fire by the Unit-
ed States and Saigon and a com
plete and immediate withdrawl of
all American troops.

Speaking for “the voiceless, ma-
jority of people who are dying,”
Miss Phuong noted that in her
spare time, while in Vietnam, she
worked with the peasants; the
people “who live in ‘poverty and
ignorance.”

The former leader of the Vietna-
mese Student Movement, previ-
ously called for peace in 1966 and
has worked openly against the gov-
ernment before leaving the coun-
try to come to the United States in
order to elicit support for the as-
sociation’s peace proposal.

Miss Phuong described the feel-
ings ‘that the Vietnamese people
have for the American soldier.
“These poor people cannot see on
the beautiful side of the American
soldiers——only the bombing side.
My people hate the American sol-
dier very much. They (the Ameri-
can soldier) look at us ready to
kill.”

She reasoned that the South
Vietnamese civilians and the Viet
Cong guerillas are physically iden-
tical and that there are no at-
temps on the part of the U.S. in-
fantry to differentiate between
them.

“Our job is not to hate," Miss
Phuong insisted, “the machinery
of the war has caused the barbar-
ity.” Instead, she sees her part in
the Third Movement——the pacifist
movement—as being to persuade
the American public that the South
Vietnamese only want to" stand
alone and that this is essential if
the country and the people are to
survive.

“Your President said he will
withdraw. He is too slow. It will
take ten years. We cannot wait ten
years." When asked about the re-
action of the South Vietnamese
soldiers to Nixon’s plan of Viet-
namization, Miss Phuong stated
that they would much rather have
complete withdrawl. “Thev (the
South‘ Vietnamese soldiers I' want
to do their own resolving."

But, the Third Force has not
been extremely successful in their
campaign in the United States.
According to Miss Phuong, there
have been numerous incidents
when U.S. government officials
have refused to see the represen-
tatives of this movement.

Alan Bricks, who is accompany-
ing Miss Phuong on her tour on
America’s major cities, followed,
urging the audience to support the
movement. “We should measure
our own commitment against that
of the Vietnamese." He concluded
by saying that Nixon is not willing
to withdraw "because the credibil-
ity of the United States is at
stake."

THE PITTSBURGH KANGAROOS answered the Conspiracy’s call for the people to be the jury that

‘ would make the real decision in their case last Saturday. Prior to a demonstration at the Federal

Building, downtown, where several hundred people turned out in large enough numbers to
surround the building, the Peoples’ Court of the Woodstock Nation convicted what they consi-
dered to be the real conspirators.

Tried for violating the rules of human decency were Lyndon Johnson, Richard J. Daley, Ed-
ward V. Hanrahan, John Mitchell, Strom Thurmond, J. Edgar Hoover, Julius “The Just" Hoff-
man and Richard Nixon and his dummy Spiro Agnew. Specifics in the indictment of the Peoples’
Court noted that the 8 it defendants had conspired among other things to make and cause to be
made incendiary devices for use in the ghettoes of the United States and small countries of the

world and for systematically acting in such a way as to disturb or extend indefinitely the sleep ,

of members of the Black Panther Party.

The jury returned a verdict of'ig'ui|ty to all charges and the defendants were sentenced to 20
years of peace and love. When counsel pleaded for mercy on the grounds of cruel and inhuman
punishment the senten : was commuted to death.

Program Encourages Sensitivity

A humanism program has been

designed to add a new dimension.
to the University. Gerry Woods, a -

worker for the new program says
that presently the University is an
institution which is society-orient-
ed; one which trains engineers,
behavioral psychologists, compu-
ter experts and dentists to meet
the needs of moder industrial so-
ciety.

She went on to say that the Uni-

versity fails, however, to provoke-
people into becoming sensitive, '

compassionate, creative human
beings. Therefore, this program

has been designed to meet the

needs of the individual.

Gil Kleinerman, another work-
er in the program, explained that
the program is based on the as-
sumption that humanism cannot
be developed through isolated
meditation or introspection; it

is only by interacting with people
that one can approach self-realiz-
ation or self-knowledge.

Kleinerman went on to say that
in today's polarized society, many
individuals have been exposed to
only one race, life-style, or ideolo-
gy. Humanism goes beyond such
barriers and, consequently, inter-
action will be encouraged among

people of all races, life-styles and I

ideologies.

The program as outlined by
Woods and Kleinerman is struc-
tured in such a fashion as to en-

POHCB Corps Offers

, by JUDY VOLLMER
Staff Writer

Representatives from the Peace
Corps were on campus this week
on the ground floor of the Cathe-
dral, with pamphlets outlining new
programs and offers that the
Peace Corps is proposing. The
Pittsburgh branch of the Peace
Corps is located at the University
and City Ministry Center at 4401
Fifth Ave.

The Peace Corps plans to
change its program in several
ways. The Corps is prepared to
suggest projects in such areas as
educational television and radio.
low-costing housing or curriculum
reform, and mobile vocational ed-
ucational centers. Also, the Peace
Corps will not undertake any proj-
ects without establishment of spe-
cific long-range and interim goals,
to the end that each project cre-_
ates a new resource that will re-
main after the Peace Corps de-
parts.

In "the future, volunteers will be
assigned in teams with varying
levels of technical competence and
experience. They will center in se-
lected areas rather than scatter-
ed in many locations.

The Peace Corps is also work-
ing on the idea of an Exchange
Peace Corps, in which people from
less developed countries would
participate in a client relationship
with the United States. These peo-
ple would come to the United
States for one year. to help the
United States during their stay,
and then return to help their own
countries. The main purpose of
this program would be to train

them to form, or work in, new na-
tional service agencies once they
return home.

By the end of this year. there
will be nearly 35,000 returned
Peace Corps volunteers in the
United States. The Corps is going
to try a "Transitional Exper-
ence" for a limited number of
newly-returned volunteers to pro-

vide them with an immediate and A

dramatic grasp of American prob-
lems and to stimulate them to ex-

plore ways to help solve those‘

problems of job opportunities and
places in education and social
service.

Ghetto Voice

re School Daze

by RICHARD J. PALAZZI

My last article mentioned a fellow who doesn‘t attend school be-
cause 'of a combination of poor teachers. paranoid administration.
and outdated curriculum, the combination of which doesn’t hold "his

interest. Let’s take a look at what

happens_to an average student if

he goes all the way through the ghetto school system.

Through third grade. a student must endureithe unproductive
classroom. If he survives this and is still attending. his reading level -
score will determine where he is placed the following year. Most go
on to follow a "normal" course of study. Some are placed in a group
called PZ. This is a semester or a year of remedial work, where the
underachieving student will stay until he can do third grade work
(specifically reading). A third group into which troublesome stu-
dents are dropped from all grade levels in EMH—educationally men-.
tally handicapped. These are children who, forsome mental, emo- '

tion_al or environmental reason, are

slow inlearning.

extremely difficult to teach and '

If.this all works properly, then normal children willlprogress
normally, PZ’s-will enter fourth grade when they are ready and then
progress normally, and the ungraded EMH students will be guided

' by specially trained educators who will have themdong eighth grade,

-work by the-time they are ready for high school.

UNFORTUNATELY, YET somehow inevitably, none or it f
works. The normal groups, because of conditions I have previously
described, are fortunate if they finish eighth grade with a fifth grade

. reading and math equivalency. And the EMH classe_s are understaff-

' . ed. Only one of the EMH teachers Imet inmytravels through sev- 7 

eral Chicago schools was trained to teach EMH'chlldren. ‘One EMH «
teacher told me, “I’m not trained to deal with these special chil-
dren; the school~just put me here. Do you have anyideas I might use ’

to improve my class?”

This teacher can't be expected to even, control a class of educa-
tionally mentally handicapped children, letalone teach them any- ’
thing. Yet can we blame it on him, when i.t is the‘ fault of a system
thatisn‘_t living up to its commitments? g V r. x ‘ . 1-  ‘

- An interesting comparison was madetome recently and I‘d'like , e ,_
how the city school children..are 

to pass it on to you. ‘It relates to
placed into high schools:

WHEN WE were in school,.swe learned to hate and fear lCom—.
munist countries because of-what happens to Communist-children
who don't work up to their abilities.’ These children, we were told,

Kare sent to farm_ and work schools to become common laborers. ., "

Other children who achieve well are trained academically and‘ be-
come technicians and businessmen.‘ They have no choice in forming-

their own future and must work‘ on the level at which the government‘, g 
trained them for the rest of their lives. ' - ‘ ' 7 A '

1

_' e So it is with thechildren of ighetto.Ar'r1e;‘ica; who are made in  

ninth grade to attend the»s,”chool"the city chooses for them. Under-, '

‘ . achievers and slow learners are sent to poor trade schools ;- the more

academically inclined attend high ‘schools where they are frequently '
-graduated with the learning of a comparable eighth grader in our

suburban schools.

Lack of Publicity In Pitt News

Editor. Pitt News,

{Students who take
try courses:

I have just left an open meet-
ing of Pitt's undergraduate cur-
riculum review committee of the
Chemistry Department. The for-
mat of the meeting was much
different than the other open

Chemis-

_;_._.Nmeetings the department offer-

ed. This time two students brief-
_ly presented several issues con-
fronting all students taking un-
dergraduate chemistry courses,
especially Chemical Engineers.
Biology majors and Chemistry
majors. The issues were simple,

such as Physics 15, 16, and 19; '

need for an undergrad. seminar,
content of Chem labs, etc. _

You know the problems, stu-
dents, I don‘t have to enumer-
ate them to you. But it seems
that everytime the department

or students have one of these‘

meetings, very few students at-
tend. There were about 18 stu-
dents and 15 faculty members

present. (the first of several
yjﬁeetings with more students

than faculty).

So, I ask myself why don’t my
other fellow Chemistry students
come to these meetings, speak
their piece,
SELVES. The faculty has been
very willing to work with us
to reshape the Chemistry Cur-
riculum, but it has been the
same students speaking out on
these problems that face all of
the students.

One? reason you might not
have come is that you didn't

here about it. Assuming you_
a-"}idn't'see one of the approx. 50

‘posters around campus, you def-

initely didn't read about it in_

The Pitt News. This is because

Harrisburg Hacks
Killing Grad Students

Editor, The Pitt News,

The financial crisis that has
been created by that group in
Harrisburg that call themselves
“representatives of the people”
has successfully created a vast
range of uncertanties of which
any group of demagogues could
‘be justly proud.

Not only are in-state and un-
dergraduate students unable to
determine the need to plan on
much-needed summer jobs but,
also, most seniors cannot be sure
that placement in a job will in
fact come to pass.

But if the hacks in the Capitol
can be proud of the planning
problems created for undergrad-
uates this summer, they can be
downright elated over the chaos
that closing Pitt would have on
the school’s graduate students.
Most of these students earn their
living ‘expenses from teaching
on a part-time basis. Thus, the
money ends the second the

school shuts down or “cuts back” _

on its programs.

All of this means that the
slum lords in Oakland (grad stu-
dents cannot live on campus)
will have a perfect opportunity
to practice the fine art of evic-
tion when the meagerly paid as-
sistants are unable to come ‘up
with the monthly fortune that
it takes to buy a room. It also
means that they can also look
forward to finding an instant
job, along with a few thousand
other students, in this polluted
hell called Pittsburgh. i

As a resident of Colorado and
California it’s hard to believe
that this is the “enlightened
northeast." I have been told
smugly that the West is where
‘Hoover could probably win to-
day. But even Reagan's Califor-
nia passes appropriated budgets
on time——with the colleges‘ getting
their fair share. Indeed, the
kind of financial mess here in
Pennsylvania is virtually an
unknown in Colorado, where the
universities are growing both in
size and prestige.

Shall I write my representa-
tive to tell him of my anger?

'That’s what they tell us to do.

But, for those of us who have
come from other states to work
on campus, voting is not one of our
rights.

Our only course of action’
seems to be in the form" of ap-
peals to‘ those in power to do
something. I would make two:

Anti-CIA Action
Explained by RSU

Editor, The Pitt News:
In a magnificent letter to the

, Pitt News, Michael Harmon de-

nounces “campus totalitarians"
who, he alleges, engaged in an
act of “repression” against the
Central Intelligence Agency. He
goes on to display his passion
for civil liberties by urging
“concerned students and admin-
istrators” to repress “these two-
bit revolutionaries."

Unfortunately, his account_of
the anti-CIA action
that he doesn’t know what he’s
talking about. Those of us who
participated in this action (from
the Revolutionary Socialist Un-
ion and Pitt _Resistance), did
not engage in “obstructing the

3) submitting a written request
(which was politely-phrased but

ignored) to have such a discus-

sion with the recruiter, and 4)
taking the recruiter's picture as
he departed. No violence. no
threats of violence, no attempt
to obstruct anything, and cer-
tainly no disruption of the
"right of. free choice" about
which Mr. Harmon claims to be
concerned.

Mr. Harmon apparently dis-
likes those of us who are "tea-
pot tyrants of the left.“ Thus,
in the name of fighting for “ac-
ademic freedom” and against
“repression,’.’ he spreadsﬂslander
-and falsification as a part of
his campaign to have us “with-
strained" from putting forth our
“own warped views" within‘ the
campus community. Noble demo-
crat,

Yet you don't have to be "in-
tellectual midgets" like us (Mr.
Harmon is precious,) to know
of the CIA's role in carrying
out policies of repression and
obstruction. violating the right
of free choice (and even the
right to be alive) of many mil-
lions of people throughout the
world. If Mr. Harom is concern-
ed about this‘ injustice (a real
one this time), he may wish to
consult The Invisible Govern-
ment by David Wise and Thomas
Ross; for even more information.

Try Capitalism I

Editor: The Pitt News: .

I have read "Electric Cars
or Smog" by David English and
Ann Miller (Feb. 9). According
to the article the cause of pollu-
tion is our capitalist economic
‘system and you propose its eli-
mination in favor of a “Socio-
economic structure which will
give' the people the decisive
power over the forces and in-
stitutions which affect their
lives".

The basic premise of capital-

ism is “a man is free to use his
own property as he sees fit for
his own profit as long as he
does not violate the rights of
other people." However. the
truth of the matter is that we
have failed to properly identify
and define the point“ where the
violation of others’ rights oc-
curs.

This is not an easy problem
to solve. but I suggest we try.

University Theatre:

‘Raving Ahead of Tie’  

by ARTHUR ROSENBERG
Drama Critic

I haven’t seen so much enthusi-
asm in a long while toward a the-
atre department presentation.
There is, of course, good reason.
In their selection of Rosencrantz
and Guildeiistern Are Dead by
Tom Stoppard. the University The-
atre has picked a winner!

-1967 —

NEW YORK DRAMA CIRCLE
CRITICS AWARD

Best Play of the Year

. It received extraordinary fav-
orable reviews in New York and
London, as well as on a triumphant
coast to coast tour earlier this
year. It would be hard to debate
such a show from its record alone

——in fact it brings with it some- '

what of a guarantee that it is a
proven and solid theatrical pro-
duct. It mav sound like I'm raying
ahead of time—but its a refreshing
thing to see the theatre handling a
challenging "winner" rather than
redoing a Broadway bomb (New
Haven?). It will be interesting to
see how director Dr. Curtis Can-
field and his associates treat this
“extraordinary” play. In any
event, the final product will have

« a lot going for it.

Harold Habson (critic for the
London Times) called it: "The
most important event in the Bri-

tish professional theatre in the
last nine years. . . . Its ingenuity
is stupendous, and the delicacy
and complexity of its plot are han-

dled with an astonishing theatrical *

mastery."

“The play takes two minor char-
acters of Shakespeare’s Hamlet
and places them in the centre of
the work. In and around these two
“attendants lords” swirls the great
drama which is taking place at
Elsinore. Rosencrantz and Guild-
enstern are shown being thrust
into a series of dramatic events
which they do not understand and
cannot control. Their fateful des-
tinies, seemingly unrelated to any-
thing they may have done to war-
rant their fate, is a time commen-
tary on_the nature of “tragedy in
our time.”

Twenty-four students make up
the cast. The title roles are being
played by Dan Frezza (a graduate
student in speech) as Rosencrantz
and William Becze (a junior) as
Guildenstern. Bert Nemitz (cur-
rently working for his Ph.D.gin
theatre arts) is the first player
and Val Mayer is Hamlet.

The architectural setting, which
will represent, in turn, the castle
at Elsinore and a ship at sea, has
/been designed by Henry Hey-
mann; costumes are by Cynthia
Krich; and Richard Evans is in

charge of technical production and

  

lighting. In addition, the special
musical score for the original Lon-
don production will be featured.

When a sports fan now asks, What’s happening at your Uni—

“Carver was as interested in athletics as anyone. He was
just a victim of circumstances. His downfall came when he hired
Dave Hart (as football coach). When Hart failed, people said,
‘Let’s clean house,’ and he was part of the house cleaning.”

Intramurals Hoop Championships Underway, I

by MARTHA HELLMAN

With all but the Fraternity and
Engineering division crowns tak-
en, the play-offs for the all-cam-
pus championship have begun. Su-
therland House, paced by Doug
Gindin’s 20 points, edged the Play-
boys, 54-51, for the Dormitory
title. Ed Palluzzi had 18 points in
a losing cause.

In the Independent "A" League,

the Fiddlers No. I captured the

crown with a perfect 5-0 record.
Their last two victories over
MBA, 68-51, and over the Dents,

.53-39. The Trotters, the second

place team in the league with a 4-1
mark, were also declared eligible
for the play-offs due to the fact

, that this league had the roughest

competition of all leagues.

The Trotters squeezed by the
Dents, 52-50, and walloped the PE
Club, 81-49, to get the second spot.
Thier only loss was to the Fid-
dlers, by a 46-45 score.

The Fiddlers No. 1 will meet the
DE’s, the “C” League champs in
the first round of the playoffs. The
DE’s also carry a 5-0 record into
the game, with their final two wins
atthe expense of the Fiddler’s No.
2, 49-40, and the Hawks, 68-49.

Two teams tied for the "B"
League crown. The Law School

-Casers and the Schmidt Brothers

both compiled 4-1 marks during
the season. They will playoff for
the right to oppose the Trotters in
the tourney playoffs.

Panthers Travel To
Westmirtster Tonight

(Continued from Page 9)

Tonight's game will begin the
Cats’ 'last week of play for the
1970 season and the only way
they will be able to reach the .500
mark is by winning the final three
games. '

The Panthers have defeated two
of the teamswho remain on the
schedule (the Titans and Carnegie-
Mellon), and have lost to the other
one (West Virginia» by only one
point. ‘ .

That could mean that the Pan-
thers have a chance to record a
.500 season, their first in six
years. One of the big drawbacks,
however, is that all of the games
are on the road.

_ BOWLERS MARK
NOW STANDS EVEN
The bowling team made a
strong showing in its match
against Point Park Saturday,
but only won two points and.its
record now stands even at 25-

  

The Casers’ last two wins were
a 62-42 thrashing of the Mob and
a 66-45 win over the Experience.
Schmidt Bros. lost their chance to
cop the title as they were nipped
by BMF, 37-34, but came backto
tie the Casers by slaughtering the
Pitt Pigs, 79-22.

Both fraternity leagues are still
up in the air with three teams in
contention in both divisions. In “A”
action, Delta Tau Delta, Phi Epsi-
lon Pi and Phi Kappa Theta all
have 4-1 records. The Delts knot-
ted things up by beating previous-
ly unbeaten Phi Kaps, 45-35. The
Eps made it a three way race by
edging Pi Lam, 39-34.

‘ In “B" competition, both Kappa
Sigma and the Fiji's have perfect

Delta Phi, 42-29, while the
Fiji’s clobbered AEPi, 70-37,
and bombed Delta Sigma Chi, 59-
30.

Theta Chi, stayed close with two
big wins over Triangle, 64-37,
