AIDS crisis reaches campuses

By Mindy Boffemmyer

Contributing Editor

Editor's note: In an article run
in the lune 8, 1988 issue of The
Pitt News, Sheryl Miller of the
University of Pittsburgh's Student
Health Services was quoted as
saying:

”There’s a general attitude
among college students that
things can't happen to them.
They can't get pregnant, can't get
V.D., won ’t get AIDS. We're try-
ing to break through to them, but
it's difficult.”

This aricle was written in
response to that statement, to in-
form Pitt students about the
problem that President Reagan
has called ”Public Enemy Num-
ber One” AIDS (the acquired im-
munodeficiency syndrome).

There have been an estimated
53,000 AIDS-related deaths in
the United States since 1982. It
is believed that 3 to 4 million
people are currently infected with
the AIDS virus and do not real-
ize it.

The AIDS virus may live in the
human body for years before ac-
tual symptoms appear. I

”What do you really know
about AIDS? Are you at risk?”
These questions were posed and
addressed in the government
pamphlet, ”Understanding
A|DS,” that was mailed to U.S.
citizens last spring.

Current information hasn't
changed significantly since that
time. A cure has not been disco-
vered. Right now, our only

defense against AIDS is edu-

cation, .
The governement report in-
cluded the following information:

0 There are two main ways
that you can become infected
with the AIDS virus: through sex-
ual intercourse or by sharing drug
needles with an infected person.

0 The AIDS virus cannot be
contracted through casual contact
with the people around you.

0 You won't get AIDS from a
mosquito bite or from the bite of
any other insect.

0 AIDS cannot be passed
through the use of a glass or an
eating utensil that someone else
has used.

0 You will not contract AIDS
from a toilet seat.

0 You won't get AIDS by
swimming in a pool, even if
someone in the pool is infected
with the virus.

0 No one is in any danger of

getting AIDS from giving blood at
a blood bank. Needles used for
blood donations are disposable.
O The risk of getting the AIDS
virus from a blood transfusion has
been greatly reduced through the
screening and testing of donated
blood for the AIDS antibody.

The government report states
that ”No matter what you have
heard, the AIDS virus is hard to
get and is easily avoided.

”You won't just ‘catch’ AIDS

like a cold or flu because the vi-‘

rus is a different type. The AIDS
virus is transmitted through sex-
ual intercourse, the sharing of
drug needles, or to babies of in-
fected mothers before or during
birth.”

Behavior described by the.

goverment as ”risky” includes
the following:

0 Sharing drug needles and
syringes.

0 Anal sex,’ with or without a
condom.

O Vaginal or oral sex with
someone who shoots drugs or en-
gages in anal sex.

0 Sex with a ”pick-up” or a
prostitute, or with someone who
has several sexual partners.

0 Sex without a condom with
an infected person.

Also according to the govern-
ment, safe sexual behavior in-
cludesz

I O Abstinence.
0 Sex with one mutually faith-
ful, uninfected partner.
0 Not shooting drugs.

Latex condoms are the best
preventive measure, aside from
the previously mentioned exam-
ples of safe sexual behavior.

There is presently no cure for
AIDS, nor is there a vaccine to
prevent uninfected people from
getting AIDS.

Drugs, including AZT, have
been used to prolong the lives of
some AIDS patients, but it may be
years before an actual, effective
cure is found.

Medical researchers across the
country are studying AIDS pa-
tients and the virus itself and
gathering information to facilitate
a cure for the deadly disease.

A study by the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and the American
College Health Association is be-
ing conducted to measure the
prevalence of AIDS among col-
lege students. '

The study involves an anony-

mous screening of the blood sam-
ples taken for ordinary health
problems at university infir-
maries. Blood samples are not be-
ing taken specifically for the
study.

The blood samples will be ana-
lyzed by an independent labora-
tory and will be identified only by
sex, age and race. Therefore, stu-
dents will not be notified of the
results. '

Of the 20 colleges to partici-
pate in the study, the American
College Health Association has
only released the name of one,
the University of Georgia in
Athens. Each school will obtain
1,000 blood samples.

The Pitt Men's Study, headed
by Dr. Charles Rinaldo, was
formed in 1983 and will continue
through 1991. The study is
designed to investigate the natur-
al history of the AIDS-causing hu-
man immunodeficiency virus
(H.|.V.) in gay and bisexual men.

According to information pub-
lished by the Pitt Men's Study, ap-
proximately 75 percent of all
reported cases of AIDS nation-
wide involve gay and bisexual
men. Hemophiliacs and in-
travenous drug users are also list-
ed as high risk groups.

The study consists of screening
specimens of the bodily fluids of
the participants in search of the
AIDS antibody in order to exa-
mine the rate at which AIDS de-
velops. These screenings are also
being used to discover why some
people who have been infected
with H.I.V. develop AIDS, while
others do not.

The Pitt Men's study is in con-
junctionwith three other univer-
sities: Northwestern University in
Chicago, Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity in Baltimore and the Univer-
sity of California at Los Angeles.

In order to make the study as
scientific and accurate as possi-
ble, each of the components of
this collaboration uses the same
questionnaires, laboratory tests
and procedures and physical ex-
amination.

Each participant in the study
signs a consent form that officially
enters him into the study. He
then completes a questionnaire
on his medical history and
lifestyle, which helps the
researchers to define his risk of
developing AIDS.

A small blood sample is taken
to be stored and used as new tests
for AIDS become available. The
volunteer receives and completes

Tuition increases are fairly
commonplace among institu-
tions of higher learning, and
Pitt is no exception. According
to Virginia Gaughan, manager
for budget operations at Pitt,
tuition has increased every
year for the past 10 years.

The major reason for the in-
crease in tuition was due to
Pitt's not receiving enough
state funding. The increase in
this year's tuition comes to 9.9
percent, raising the annual
cost to $3,680, up. from
$3,350 last year.

”Pitt had asked for a 20 per-
cent increase [in state funding]
— actually, a little bit more
than that —— and got only four
percent,” Gaughan said.

Pitt is presently waiting for
Gov. Casey's approval of a bill
which would increase Pitt's
state funding by 6 percent. The
Senate version of that bill was
passed by the House and sent
to Casey in July.

”We had hoped it would be
resolved by early August, but
now we think maybe in early
September,” said Dr. John

Lack of state funds
causes tuition hike

A-3 :

Yeager, vice president of the
office of business and
management.

Yeager said that the delay is
probably due to late petitions
for funding from the social
service sectors. ”The governor
i_s well-disposed to education,
and the legislature recognizes
the need to increase funding,”
Yeager said. ”We are making I
the assumption that we will
have a favorable resolution."

Gaughan said that the
amount of money that tuition
will reach is directly contin-
gent on the amount of funding
received by the state, and
since the exact amount is not
known until the budget is
passed, Pitt must draw up an
extensive list of alternatives
dealing with the various levels
of state funding possible.

Gaughan also said that the g
budget request from the state
is always based on a zero per-
cent tuition increase.

”Alternate scenarios are de-
veloped,” Gaughan said, ”so
depending on what the state
decides we will know which
alternative to go with.”

Yeager said that the money

Crackdown

Police assure community that drinking laws will be upheld

By Scot Ross

News Editor

In the state of Pennsylvania, the
penalties for underage drinking
have stiffened within the past
year. The enforcers of these laws

, hold steadfast, unbending about

imbibing minors. As far as they
are concerned, an underage
drinker is one thing: busted.
Many of the University of Pitts-
burgh's under-21 crowd seek the
”comforts" of alcohol through a
series of illegal means. They may

I choose to try and deceive a bar's

local bouncer, or they may get an
older person to purchase their li-
quor. Or, they maysimply get
themselves into any number of
Pitt's fraternity houses to score

. themselves a beer.

According to Interfraternity

1 Council President Chuck Farinel-

la, the IFC is looking to educate
the Pitt Greek system as to the
dangers of alcohol abuse and the
legalities of serving minors alco-
,_hol, rather than take legal action
against any individual house.

Farinella maintains, ”The IFC
has to recognize the laws that
govern the state. And the law of
[this] state says that if you are not
21, you're not allowed to drink,

and we have to condone and .
i hold that position.” .

James Zemar, an acting super-

visor of the Bureau of Liquor
Control Enforcement for the
Pennsylvania State Police, ex-
plained the legalities his office
usually deals with in relation to
college campuses include under-
age drinking and fraternities that
charge guests for admittance.
”Our policy is we are not go-

. ing to tolerate it, and we are.go—

ing to make arrests," Zemar said.

Of these specific charges, Ze-
mar said the sale of alcohol
without a licence is considered a
misdemeanor and carries a fine.
He also explained the more seri-
ous charges can stem from the
fraternities providing minors with
liquor. The first offense is punish-
able by a $1,000 fine per under-
age drinker, the second offense
can carry the more. serious
punishment of a $2,000 fine per
guest and up to a year in jail for
the officers of the fraternity.

In addition, the law reads that
no court can lower or suspend
the fine once it is issued.

”As far as looking at it from a
realistic point of view, over 90
percent of all college freshmen,

before they get to the university, ‘

have already had alcohol, and for
me to wave some kind of magic
wand and say, ’We|l, you have to
stop drinking until you're 21,’
doesn't seem like it's going to
happen," said Farinella.

Zemar, however, did not
seemed resigned to the same fate
and stated, ”We don't view a col-
lege campus as different. It is
against the law and we will en-
force it."

Farinella said, ”The only thing
we can attack and the area we're
trying to hit home is in edu-
cation."

Our policy is we are
not going to tolerate it,
and we are going to
make arrests. We don ’t
view a college campus
as different.

— Officer Iames Zemar
—
  //

”You’ve got to understand that

they're going to drink anyway

and if they are going to drink,
they have got tofunderstand 
the possible consequences, the
liabilities, the things they could
[get] themselves into, of lately,
the stiffening of the liquor laws,
to educate my people on the con-
sequences of what could happen
as a result of drinking underage,"
said Farinella.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 29, I988

As Zemar explained that, in the
event of injury or death resulting
from alcohol distributed at a
fraternity function, ”the fraterni-
ty and its officers can be sued for
liabilities if an accident occurs."

”For [the IFC] to bring [a frater-
nity house before the judiciary
board] and find them guilty some-
how and charge them a $1,000
fine would be nothing compared
to the kind of penalties they are
going to get from the State
Police," said Farinella. ”As far as
the enforcement goes, the state is
there to do the job. The commu-
nity can provide the complaint."

Farinella addressed the IFC’s
role in judicial matters surround-
ing underage drinking in the
houses. While at the present time
there is a mandatory rule stating
that fraternity guests must show
proper identification, Farinella

"believes that "someday down the

road, therewill be certain res-
trictions."

Farine|la’s program has includ-
ed lectures by officers of the State
and Pitt Campus police forces.

Officer Charles Greer of the Pitt
Police said that he met with the
IFC and they discussed the state
law, as well as the role the cam-
pus police will have in the en-
forcement of these laws.

Greer added that one of the
problems the campus police have
with monitoring all of the frater-
nity parties is that several of the
houses are situated off-campus; in
those instances, where the cam-
pus police have no jurisdiction,
the complaints are referred to the
Zone 6 Precinct of the Pittsburgh
Police. In other instances, the
complaints may even be given to
the State Police.

”This past year we haven't had
any problems at Pitt; however, in
the past we have had to come in
and make arrests," Zemar stated.

The laws have been toughened
and the Pitt Fraternities are being
armed through education to deal
with the problems of minors and
alcohol. Said Farinella, ”That is
my point, to inform them of what
they're facing in the upcoming
year. I have to at least do that."

Safe sexual practices
stressed on campus

By Betty Linden Sarafin
For The Pitt News

Sex therapist Dr. Ruth
Westheimer isn't the only one
who recommends the use of con-
doms — so do several authorities
on the University of Pittsburgh,
main campus.

Jan DeVoe, nurse health edu-
cator from Student Health Serv-
ices, said, ”Condom sales have
increased at our campus pharma-
cy, although national studies in-

dicate students as a whole are not

taking more precautions."

According to Chuck Farinella,
president of the Interfraternity
Council, the Pi Kappa Alpha
fraternity will install a condom
machine in their house, located
on campus. In addition, the coun-
cil has invited Richard P. Keeling,
a leading authority on AIDS, to
speak at the university this fall.
Farinella said, ”Easy access and
availabilty to condoms are essen-
tial to practicing safe sex," and,
he said that the council is aware
of the responsibility to educate
the university community.

Condom machines were voted
down twice by university offi-
cials. The first motion was made
by the Student Health Services,
and then a student group in-
troduced the idea. DeVoe be-
lieves lifestyle and behavior are
also important factors in regard to
sexually transmitted diseases and
the use of condoms. The policy
for distribution of condoms from
Student Health Services is that
”they canbe purchased at the
campus pharmacy," said DeVoe.

The University of Pittsburgh at
Bradford does have condom
machines on campus. After five
months of discussion within the
administration, the machines
were approved and installed for
the fall semester of I987. The fi-
nal decision came from UPB
President Dr. Richard McDowell.

The response has been a ma-

ture acceptance, according to
Philip Burlingame, director of
Residential Life and Housing at
UPB. One of the big deciding fac-
tors was the rural location of the
campus; the.nearest convenience
or drug store is approximately
two miles away. In conjunction
with making contraceptives avail-

, able, literature is distributed ad-

vising on the practice of safe and
healthy sex.

The Student Health Service
here conducts seminars on AIDS,
and according to DeVoe, there

/ has been an increase in requests

for seminars, particularly from
professors. Some of the schools
and courses requesting seminars
include the School of Public
Health, freshman engineering
classes, freshman advising class-
es, child development classes
and human sexuality classes.
Also, there will be training ses-
sions for seminars with resident
directors and resident assistants
this month.

Dr. Pamela Bowen of Student
Health Services said, ”Chlamydia
is the most common STD show-
ing up with students on campus,
approximately 15 cases per
month." Every female who
comes in for a routine gynecolog-
ical exam is also tested for
chlamydia because it can result
in Pelvic lnflamatory Disease,
which can cause sterility. In
males, chlamydia, left untreated,
can cause
prostate and epididymis. Another
common STD being treated at the
Health Services is genital warts.
Less common are herpes, crab
lice, gonorrhea and syphilis.

A new service that is being ren-
dered this fall is pre—AlDS—test
counseling. Issues are dealt with
such as: ”Where do I go to get
tested? What do I do if my test is
positive? and What are my
chances for a normal life?” Office
hours for Student Health Service
are from 8 a.m.to 10 p.m. Mon-
day through Friday.

Dave and Andy’s serves up a refreshing ice breaker

By Kathy Vallely

For The Pitt News

”A cone in the hand is worth
a smile on the face,” according
to David Tuttle of Dave and An-
dy's Homemade Ice Cream Shop
located at 207 Atwood St. in
Oakland. And judging by the
popularity of the shop, a lot of
people are leaving with smiles on
their faces.

The ice cream shop was start-
ed about five years ago by two
young entrepreneurs, Tuttle and
Andy Hardy, both from the North
Hills area of Pittsburgh. The idea
began when Andy, a graduate of
Hobart College in New York,

Dave Tuttle of ”Dave and Andy's" Ice Cream Shop making another batch of that frosty

sensation.

purchased an o|d—tashioned ice
cream maker in the Boston area.
When he brought it back home,
the joke was that Andy would be-
come an ice cream maker since
he bought the machine.

Gradually, the joking became
serious talking and researching.
The two began a marketing sur-
vey to see how an ice cream bus-
iness would survive in the
Oakland area.

They saw the great number of
people on the streets of Oakland
and thought that it would be a
great place to start a new kind of
business, a homemade ice cream
business. With four hospitals,
numerous businesses and the col-

 

lege campuses in the area, the
market seemed very good. Many
ice cream shops come and go in
the Oakland area, but Dave and
Andy’s still remains after five
years.

One of the reasons that Dave
and Andy's survives is that the
prices are so affordable. Accord-
ing to Tuttle, the prices have only
gone up once in five years. This
is one reason why so many types
of people are attracted to Dave
and Andy's — from businessmen
and women at lunchtime and fa-
milies in the evening to the stu-
dents at all hours of the day.

Dave and Andy pride them-
selves on the quality of their ice

cream. They term their ice cream
as ”super premium” with only 14
percent butterfat in all ice creams
without nuts and chocolate,
which are slightly higher in but-
terfat content. The ice cream has
low overrun, which means there
is less air in the ice cream than
in most others.

With over 500 different flavors,
Dave and Andy's has received
national recognition for their
chocolate-peanut butter and their
honey-apple-cinnamon-granola
flavors. Each day, Dave and Andy
show 14 to 16 of their flavors,
with numerous types of add-ins
to mix with them. Dave and
Andy also make their own cones,

and on certain days, the sweet
smell of the cones baking can be
caught as you pass the shop.

There are plans of expanding
the business into other areas to
form a chain of Dave and Andy's
Homemade Ice Cream Shops.
The right locations need to be
found in order to materialize
these plans. According to Tuttle,
there was another store, but the
location was bad, and it did not
last long. But considering their
huge success in the .Oak|and
area, as soon as Dave and Andy
find the right locations, there will
be Dave and Andy's Homemade
Ice Cream Shops all over the
country.

Substanceabuse at Pitt poses controversy

By Mark R. Brown

Contributing Editor »

The subject of whether or not
a drug problem exists on the Pitt
campus invites a variety of
responses.

"I don't think that we have a
drug problem on campus. The
presence of drugs is here, we
know that,” said Detective Ser-
geant Fran Walsh of campus
security. ”It's like any other en-
vironment. We try and deal with
it."

According to Walsh, the No. 1
drug on campus is alcohol, but
he said the new state law is hav-
ing some impact on underage
drinking. ’’If not for any other rea-
son, underage drinkers think
more of the consequences of get-
ting caught. It doesn't pay to be
blatant in breaking that law,” said
Walsh. '

The new alcohol law, which
went into effect in this state May
24, could have serious repercus-

g sions for Pitt students this fall.

”Fraternities are going to have to
reassess their activities,” said

age drinking sections.

Pitt’s Interfraternity Council
President Chuck Farinella
brought up the issue of the new
law's effects on Pitt's Greek sys-
tem to fraternities last spring and
said he met considerable nega-
tive feedback from some Pitt un-
degrads which persists today. In
regards to the possibility that a
Pitt fraternity might get raided by
authorities, Farinella said, ”It’s a
possibility. The alcohol law is
quite clear, but regarding a Pitt
fraternity getting raided, that's up
to the individual fraternities. I
can't go around knocking beers
out of the hands of underage
drinkers. That might be 600 peo-
ple. My job is to inform the frater-
nities about the risk of violating
the law. What happens this fall
depends on the fraternities en-
forcing the new law.

”The State Police aren't going
to storm in and shut a place down
unless a certain number of things
went wrong, such as complaints

being made that a nuisance ex-
ists, or if money was being ex-
changed for alcohol -
technically, that's operating a
’speakeasy’,” added Farinella.
”When authorities shut down a
speakeasy, they're empowered to
haul out everything involved with

the use of alcohol — tables,
chairs, the bar, literally clean the
place out."

On the subject of the use of il-
licit drugs, Drug Enforcement
Agent Jim Porten said, ”DEA
usually gets involved in a case
when large quantities are in-
volved.” Porten pointed out the
federal law which doubles the
severity of the penalty for selling
drugs within 1000 feet of a
school.

”The DEA in Pittsburgh has
limited resources, but if Pitt came
to me about a drug problem, then
I'd address it. They should be
making their own busts with their
own network of undercover
fo|ks,” said Porten, who said that
one of the biggest problems in
this area is within the medical
profession. According to Porten,
”Our task force has contributed
in getting substantial convictions
on doctors and pharmacists writ-
ing bogus prescriptions for drug
addicts. Doctors also have easy
access to cocaine, which is
everywhere.”

A local physician, speaking
on the condition of anonymity,
commented on drug abuse wi-
thin the medical community.
"My health and my entire sense
of self-respect was affected by my
coke habit. I lost the love of my
wife and almost lost my career,”
he said. In order to be able to
practice in this state, he had to
enroll in Narcotics Anonymous,
which is affiliated with Alcohol-
ics Anonymous. ”In the hospital
I worked in, several of us used a
lot of coke. I was able to get phar-
maceutically pure coke in a way
that would never be associated
with myself or my friends. In a
20-month period, I lost 30
pounds. I only slept three or four
hours a night, and it really affect-
ed my functioning. I was losing
my ability to deal with my job
without snorting, and my wife left
me. I also spent about 60 grand
on coke. All I have to show for
my partying is an empty life.”

Porten said that most illicit drug
transactions, like those involving
cocaine, happen within a small
circle of buyers and sellers.
”Penetrating them can be
difficult, but we make buys from
lowest to highest. There's a vari-
ety of charges that we can get to
stick, and conspiracy is the
easiest.

”Every law enforcement group
utilizes informants. We do, as
does the Secret Service, Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Fire-
arms. Some of them are civic-
minded folks, others are motivat-
ed by money. Unfortunately, the
Federal Protection Plan is difficult
to get into,” said Porten.

Last year, Dr. Arlene Seal,
former University Honors Col-
lege assistant dean, said that
several Pitt Honors College stu-
dents approached her with con-
cerns of drug trafficking and use
within the Honors College. It was
alleged that an advisor in the
Honors College was selling co-
caine and other illicit drugs to stu-
dents in the Honors College.
After reporting drug trafficking
within the Honors College, Seal
was dismissed from Pitt.

Seal has since filed a lawsuit
against Pitt and individuals in-
cluding UHC Dean G. Alec
Stewart, Jack L. Daniel, Donald
Henderson, Jerome Rosenberg,
Lewis Popper, Jack Freeman,
Mary Ann Bishop-Coffey and
Wesley Posvar.

In the 27-page lawsuit, Seal
contends that she was ”wrongfu|-
ly, unlawfully, willfully, wanton-
ly and maliciously discharged”
from her employment as an assis-
tant dean. She states that the
defendants’ conduct was motivat-
ed by an improper intent to de-
ter or sanction her for reporting
information to the police con-
cerning the sale and distribution
ofdrugs and for urging the Pitt ad-
ministration to uncover and
eradicate the pervasive use of
drugs within the university be-
tween employees and students.
She believes that ”the conduct of
the defendants was part and par-
cel of a concerted effort to con-
ceal a serious problem involving
the sale and use of drugs within
the university.” The lawsuit is
currently under litigation.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 29, T988

Fall fashion combines past and present

By Jill Pirchesky

For The Pitt News

It would be a more than
difficult task to classify the up-
coming fall fashion line in one
series of words. But, while
there is no one overriding
theme, there are several tan-
gents and individual looks for
the fashion conscious man
and woman for autumn.

Among them, the fashion for
the fall season features many
of the classic 1920s look, cou-
pled with the bright colors of
today's styles.

Hit or Miss sales clerk Susan
Morenzi said, ”Dark black
jeans, the layered look, pastel
sweaters and ()versized shirts
with fancy buttons are the new
fad for fall.’’ Also, jean jackets
with fur and leather collars, tie
dyes and exclusive gold jewel-
ry have become the new
trends.

According to Morenzi, the
year's top labels include Chris-

tian Dior, Argenti and Gallery.

The difference between '87
and '88 fashion is the over-
sized, layered look has now
changed to a more feminine,
tight fit.

Clothes from Italy for both
males and females are availa-
ble at Benetton shops. Numer-
ous classic pastel colors with
exclusive patterns are a part of
the look of the 20s. Clerk Deb-
bie DePascale explained that
”lodhpurs Pants" will be a hit
this year.

”Wool bermuda shorts,
walking shorts and cardigans
are back in style along with
mock turtlenecks and plaids,”
she said, adding, ”The new
‘fantasy look’ is sweaters with
different patterns such as
patchwork, embroidery and
big buttons.” It promises to be
a hit.

DePascale in addition, said
that while the past years have
been dominated by conserva-

tive fashion, this year will fea-
ture many bright colors.

Overall, men's fashion has
been relatively stagnant in the
past few years. Fashion ex-
perts, agree, though, that a
more colorful wave will hit the
scene come fall.

”A|l cotton an(l and wool
are what our merchandise is,"
said Kim Paris of American Ea-
gle.

The men will have their
choice from the fall repetoire
of Europe's famous labels.
They include Generra, Esprit,
Cant, Albert Nipon and Liz
Claiborne.

These designers have aug-
mented last year's "conserva-
tive look” with additional
suspenders, pinstripes and
baggy slacks for men to
choose from.

With summer fading fast, it’s
time to push aside styles of the
past and invest in fashion of
the future.

Cathedral of Learning:
a center of education

By Rich Cholodofsky

Staff Writer

The Cathedral of Learning. It
has towered over the University
of Pittsburgh for more than half
a century. And like the universi-
ty itself, it holds a past and a
present — a history of tales, sto-
ries and anecdotes.

Everybody knows that the
Cathedral is tall. To be more pre-
cise, it is 5.35.48 feet tall. Con-
tained in that frame are 42 floors
of offices, classrooms and any-
thing and everything else.

That type of information is eas-
ily found. If you want to impress
your friends, win a bet or just be
the life of the party, pay close at-
tention to all this Cathedral trivia
which is about to follow.

There are 110 classrooms in
the Cathedral of Learning, which
is hardly anything when com-
pared with the over 1,200 offices
which are in the building.

Not enough trivia for you?
Well, there are 27 men's
bathrooms, 27 women's
bathrooms, one men's and one
women's shower, 62 janitor
closets, 42 maintenance
storerooms, 17 kitchenettes, a
printing press, a bindery, a laun-
dry, a dark room and two locker
rooms.

More, you say? OK, there are
186 corridors, four telephone
booth areas, four projector
rooms, an observation room, a
children's play room, seven

ROTC supply rooms, a photo

There are nine elevators which
can bring you to any of those
areas. If you like to exercise, you
can climb the steps, which num-
ber over 2,000.

If you are inclined to take the
elevators, allow enough time
when riding up to the 36th floor,
because an uninterrupted ride
takes at least 57 seconds.

There are currently 21 nation-
ality rooms. Two other rooms, the
African Heritage Room and the
Ukranian Room, are in the works.

An oddity about the Early
American Room, which is locat-
ed on the third floor, is that there
are two secret rooms within it.

To gain access to them, you
open up a closet and pull a click-
er which is on the ceiling, and
then a brick wall opens up to rev-
eal a narrow staircase which
leads to a bedroom and a storage
closet.

With the Cathedral being
around for as long as it has been,
it is not totally unexpected to
have some strange things happen
there.

”The history of the place is in-
teresting,” said Rich Weber, a
custodial worker in the
Cathedral.

She told me she drank 11 cups
of coffee before our interview
and apologized twice for being
I0 minutes late. An hour earlier,
she spoke to thousands of people.
Now, she looked tired. Yet, be-
ing tired doesn't seem to slow
down Action News anchor-
person Sally Wiggin.

”There are regrets that I'm not
a jockey, thereare regrets that I'm
not a veterinarian — two things
to this day I'd love to be," said
Wiggin. ”Those aren't serious
regrets. They're childhood fanta-
sies. I certainly do not regret hav-
ing chosen Pittsburgh as a place
to reside because I love it here.”

Wiggin, 35, co-anchors Chan-
nel 4's daily 6 p.m. news and has
worked in Pittsburgh at WTAE-TV
since’ March of 1980. Born in
Michigan, she received a
Bachelor of Arts degree in histo-
ry from the University of Alaba-
ma and a master's degree in
Chinese studies at the University
of Michigan. She has also been

enrolled as a special student in
Pitt's Asian studies programs.

She knows four languages:
Chinese, Japanese, French and
Spanish. ”At one point, I was
functional in two of them,” she
said. ’’I am no longer even that.”

In 1982, Wiggin took her first
trip abroad to China, and in
I986, she visited Japan. ”|’ve
never been to Europe, though,”
she said. ”I feel deprived.”

She liked to joke, and at times,
it was easy to forget the formal
conduct associated with in-
terviews.

”I always wanted to go abroad
when I was in college," she stat-
ed. ”My family couldn't really af-
ford it, and I had to work in the
summers."

Her answers were quick and
her voice strong. When the topic

.of sports came up, however, she

paused a few seconds to smile. It
was sports which attracted her to
broadcasting.

”I had always wanted to be-
come a great athlete,” she said.
”I don't think I had that much
potential. Like many sportscasters

I know, I thought if I can't play
it, I'll cover it, and that thought
had not occurred to me until I
was in graduate school.

’’I wasn't happy living the aca-
demic life,” she added. ”I want-
ed to become someone like
Gayle Gardner and cover sports.
That's when I started thinking
about going into television."

I worry that Ameri-
cans don't know as
much about the world
as the world knows
about them.

— Sally Wiggin

Wiggin started her broadcast-
ing career as a street reporter for
an Alabama radio station. ”I had
no experience except I had a
liberal arts education and I could
write," she said. She soon land-

ed a job as a part—time reporter at '

a television station. Soon after,
she accepted a position as a

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 29, I988

general assignments reporter at
WTAE—TV. Nine months later, the
station offered herthe weekend
anchor job and eventually the job
of anchoring the weekday

broadcast.

According to Wiggin, it's
difficult for a woman to enter the
television field as a sports report-
er. She said there are more job
openings in the news
department.

”Once I got into hard news, I
really decided that was my in-
terest, that was my love, and I
wanted to stay in that,” she said.
”I prefer being a fan [to] covering
sports as a profession."

Wiggin said she considers Pitt
a ”second home.” ”There’s
something invigorating about this
campus and Oakland,” she said.
”If Michigan were to play Pitt, I
would be hardpressed to choose
a team. Especially in football, be-
cause I love Coach Gottfried." Af-
ter a moment's thought, she said,
’’I probably would end up root-
ing for Michigan, and everyone
would kill me.”

”ControlIed chaos" is how

Wiggin describes herself on the
job. ”Actually, I'm disorganized
off the job too,” she said. ’’I don't

hyperactive as I am. I'm that way
normally about everything.”

Wiggin said that sometimes it
is difficult for her to separate her
feelings from the story she is
reporting.

(‘There was a tendency, I think
on my part, to be less restrained
in reporting about Mayor
Caliguiri's death,” she said. ”Any
tears would have been genuine,
but in that capacity, they would
have been inappropriate.”

Wiggin added that the worst
part of her job is ”the fact that
people consider us celebrities.

’’I love taking part in commu-
nity activities and making appear-
ences,” she said, ”but it makes
me a little sad that someone
thinks of me as someone differ-
ent than they are. I'm not. I'm just
doing a job."

Wiggin also said that she ”re—
belled” against the cosmetic
aspect of televised news. ”lt’s
taken me many years to realize
that the cosmetic aspect of the
business is an important ingre-
dient because, if there is a distrac-
tion cosmetically, someone is not

Wiggin noted that sometimes

i local television news coverage

neglects to encompass interna-
tional affairs. ”We are part of a
global community, and I worry
that Americans don't know as
much about the world as the
world knows about them,” she
said.

She described WTAE-TV’s
news room as ’’professional with
an edge to it. There's probably
more joking and more zany an-
tics that go on in the newsroom
than in most offices. It's very easy
to make me laugh,” she said.

News is more of a product than
a service, said Wiggin. ”I feel
sometimes there are conflicts
when you are doing something
not just to inform the public.
You're doing something to com-
pete within the ratings and to get
people to watch you. If you do
the best job of informing the pub-
lic, people will watch you. I don't
think you're selling out by being
a commercical enterprise.”

Wiggin said her personal life

Number of applications to Pitt continue to increase

By HH Phchesky

For The Pitt News

They're here. A whole new
batch of freshmen has, once
again, arrived at Pitt. Yet, this
year's freshmen class is said to be
a little different.

According to Betsy Porter, dean
of Admissions and Financial Aid,
the number of fall applications
grew by 25 percent and the aca-
demic quality of freshmen this
year has improved.

Danny Bress, incoming fresh-
man, states, ”Due to over rate in
the freshman class, rushing to
schedule for my classes was a lit-
tle disheartening; but after much

frustration and aggravation, I
have managed to receive the
classes that I wanted.

’’I’m really excited to attend Pitt
this fall; l hear it's a completely
different experience in both study
and social,” he added.

Porter said that 82 percent of
Pitt students requested to live on
campus. Only 62 percent could
be accommodated. Therefore, 20
percent of students are on a wait-
ing list and 18 percent are com-
muting students.

Anne Cinquegrane from Squir-
rel Hill decided on Pitt because
of the convenient location.”Pitt
will be challenging but a positive
experience. I'm looking forward

to attending the football and
basketball games — hopefully I'll
find time between studying and
my job,”she said.

”Throughout my four years of
college, my goal is to accomplish
as much as I can, including aca-
demic, social and many exciting
experiences,” states freshmen
Anne Kagan. ”lt’s going to shape
my life, and it's up to me to do
it.” Kagan will study internation-
al law.

According to Porter, the admis-
sions office set strategies for stu-
dent population. Student
recruitment was conducted

This year's marketing proce-
dures were accomplished in
recruiting students from different
parts of the country. Twenty—five
percent of students are from out-
side Pennsylvania.

”The freshman class of 1992 is
going to be more geographically
diverse than [incoming classes
have] historically been,” said
Porter.

Roman Gluvam, incoming
freshman, states, ’’I'm a little in-
timidated in such a big school.
This is my biggest fear.”

To dorm or not to dorm — a simple matter of taste

By William Young
Managing Editor

By now, anyone reading this is-
sue of the paper has already com-
mitted himself to where he's
going to be living, with the ex-
ception of those unfortunate
freshmen forced into living in the
lounges on every third floor in the
towers. One question burning in
the minds of everyone is, un-
doubtedly, ”what’s it like on the
other side?”

Dorm life seems cut and dried
to most people. Most freshmen
will find themselves stuffed into

a pie-shaped cell in one of the
three towers. Females may get
lucky and get a year of purgatory
in Holland. Freshmen can, of
course, get lucky and wind up in
one of the dorms in the Quad,
but that's apparently a rarity.
Dorm life has much to offer. All
of the buildings have security
desks, so there's no chance of
someone breaking into the build-
ing. Each dorm has laundry facil-
ities that are a decent bargain
when the machines work, so
there are no long hikes to the
laundromat. For the most part,
the residence halls are clean,

although roaches are a problem.

The university has actually
gone to the trouble of putting
new windows on the dorms, so
now if you live in one of the tow-
ers you can actually breathe fresh
air. The university is a little bit
slow when it comes to turning
the heat on in the fall, but a
phone call from each person in
each dorm will get maintenance
to turn it on.

Living in the dorms also makes '

it convenient to eat, as the
cafeterias are only an elevator
ride away.

hand, can be quite a culture
shock. Moving out of the dorms
is almost like moving away from
Mom and Dad. No longer is
everything taken care of in one
easy payment as landlords like to
earn their money monthly.

Apartments are almost com-
petitively priced with the dorms,

Local service offers ahuman solution to homelessness

By Sandy Paciulli
For The Pitt News

Once upon a time, in the land
of the plentiful, a poor, homeless
woman trudged through the bit-
ter snow with a small child
wrapped only in a tattered linen,
frugally searching for food and a
warm shelter for the night. Find-
ing neither, she laid the child
upon a bed of dry brush, using
her own frail body to shelter him

from the cold winter air. 

Although this may sound like
a fairy tale in dire need of a fairy
godmother and a happy ending,
it is a heart—rending reality.

On Jan. 28, a survey was con-
ducted by the Coalition of Horne-
lessness in Pennsylvania (with the
cooperation of 70 percent of the
functioning shelters in the state)

which determined approximate-

ly 5,250 persons, from infants to
senior citizens, spent this lonely
night in an emergency shelter.
This incredibly high number does

not include those persons forced
to spend the night in the streets,
in cars, parks, woods, etc. This
number gradually increases,
however, during the summer
months, due to the runaway sit-
uation.

What exactly does it mean to
say ” homelessness”? The Coali-
tion, through the incorporation of
different views of this issue, has
defined it as ”a condition in
which individuals and families
have no residence, owned,
leased or shared, in which they
can live safely, healthfully and le-
gally both night and day and in
which they can meet their social
and basic needs in privacy and
with dignity.”

Mary Alice Newhams, founder
of the East Suburban Christian
Pantry Network (ESCPN) located
in the Westinghouse Human
Service in Turtle Creek, noticed
how problematic the homeless
situation in Allegheny County
had become.

labs.

”We know of people living in
tents in backyards,” she said.

Within one year of operation,
the ESCPN, which was original-
ly created to help the six in-
dividual food pantries allot the
surplus (received from the Low
Commodity Volume food distri-
butions and local food banks)
among the less fortunate families
in the community, had become
an agency providing ”basic life
necessities,” including shelter
and clothing needs. The ESCPN
now has 40 food pantries, cloth-
ing and housing banks and
receives funding from govern-
ment agencies including the
Department of Welfare. ’

In 1984, the ESCPN became
the designated shelter program in
the East Suburbs. At that time,
there were no established shelters
in the area. But there were many
families which had no other op-
tion than living in the streets.
Through ESCPN, Newhams and
her cohorts (including her hus-

Debra House is set up similar-
ly to a dorm. Each family has its
own living/sleeping quarters but
they share a common bath on
each floor. Kitchen facilities are
also shared, but each woman is
given her own ample cooking
space. The building is equipped
to house 15 families with a max-
imum of 30 persons.

While living in Debra House,
the women are still able to col-
lect welfare and food stamps. But
the ultimate goal of the board of
directors is to slowly lead these
women away from dependence
on public assistance programs
and show them they can be ”self-
sufficient" and potential
homeowners.

According to the Newhams,
many of the women desire
careers but fear they will lose
everything in the process. First,
they feel they do not have the
skills or education desired by em-
ployers, and they realize this may
force them into taking part—time

for this program. The staff, for ex-
ample, has been working on a
voluntary basis for quite some
time. In addition, residents of the
Braddock community do not
necessarily want this shelter run
in their neighborhood.

Many of the Braddock residents
have labelled it as a ”house of
prostitution” and a ”halfway
house for drug rehabilitation.”
Neither of these assumptions is
true, and the Newhams and their
co-workers are trying to show the
community that they could not
be more wrong. They have en-
couraged the community to at-
tend town meetings and hearings
regarding the situation via door-
to-door distributions of pamph-
lets, brochures and meeting no-
tices. The Newhams said that in
the end, about six persons
showed up at the meetings.

”We are really trying to hear
what they are saying,” said Mrs.
Newhams. So, what they cannot
tell the people, they plan to show

band Frank) began placing the fa-
milies in low income housing
projects. -

in 1986, Mrs. Newhams and
Sister Donna Tracy worked
together to create the Bridge to
Independence (BTl) program.
This program was designed to as-
sist the single woman with chil-
dren. These two women
”pushed” their ideas and were
soon able to acquire the appropri-
ate documents and funding to set
their plan into action.

According to Newhams,
”Women are poor, on the whole.
And their children are poorer.”
From the efforts of these two
women, Donna House evolved.

Donna House is a 30-day
shelter to help the homeless get
back onto their feet, or to at least
provide a warm haven for those
persons desperately seeking help.

Donna House staff and volun-
teers work to find these women
housing according to their in-
come levels (a family of two
receives less than $22 per day)
and provide them with counsel-
ing and an understanding friend
to talk to.

The shelter does not, at the
present time, have appropriate fa-
cilities or funds to house these fa-
milies for a longer period of time.

Debra House is a ’’transitional
organization” for single mothers
with children. It is a three-story
former convent building located
at 16 Holland Avenue in Brad-
dock. It is now being made ready
for renovations which will begin
in the next couple of weeks and
will be finished four months from
the starting date.

”We have all of the renovation
money committed to the project
as necessary to complete it," said
Frank Newhams, director of
Debra House.

At the present time, Debra
House has the funds for the first
five years of operation. It has
made all the plans, hired a con-
tractor, purchased furniture and
is now preparing to hire an active
director for the shelter.

jobs at minimum wage. Once
employed, the women lose their
welfare and medical benefits they
depend upon for their families.
Second, their modes of transpor-
tation are very limited. And third,
it is very difficult for these wom-
en to find day care for their chil-
dren at a reasonable price.

The people at Debra House are
aware of these problems and pro-
vide counselors to help the wom-
en plan for the future and to give
them the support they need to
carry on. The women are strong-
ly encouraged to participate in
services offered by the shelter.
These services include basic life
skills and homemaking, with
training conducted on site. They
also have educational and job-
training courses offered at off-site
locations such as Carlow College,
whose program is very strong.

In addition to these courses,
Debra House offers assistance in
the other areas that cause
problems. Transportation is made
available to the women by staff
and volunteers, when necessary.
The shelter also provides day care
center services on the premises.
All of the programs are provided
to the women at minimal or no
cost as long as they meet the set
requirements: You must be a
homeless woman of any age and
you must have children who are
not in school full-time. Unfor-
tunately, the shelter is not large
enough to satisfy the needs of the
entire homeless community, and
there is a waiting list for this two-
year shelter. In the future, the
board of directors hopes to
receive enough funding to open
additional shelters of the same
caliber.

Although a great deal of time
and effort is put into the program,
some women will leave with
their children in the same posi-
tion as when they originally came
to this shelter.

”No program is perfect,” said
Newhams. And at this time, the
house is experiencing problems.
Funds are not readily available

them.

The first step is to prove to the
community that Debra House
-residents‘are not ”bad” people.
No men are permitted in the
building as long as its residents
are inside, not even staff mem-
bers. This is an attempt to reduce
the fear of prostitution. Backyard
barbecues and birthday parties
for the children are conducted to
show that these families are the
same as any other.

But the most drastic step the
staff is taking is selling their
homes and moving into the area.
They feel the neighbors will be
more at ease seeing that they are
determined to make the project
work and are not afraid to let their
children be neighbors and friends
to the homeless families.

As observed by Mary Ellen
Rauch, member of the house's
board of directors, ”Who’s there
to give them a hand?”

The shelter is run on 99 percent
volunteer work, and the
Newhams encourage communi-
ty involvement. ”They [the
homeless] need to talk to some-
body who knows what it's like to
have a savings account," said Mr.
Newhams.

They feel that the support and
consolation of people (particular-
ly women) who have their lives
well ”in control” can have a very
positive effect on these families.

It is evident that this problem
will never be totally eliminated,
but it can be decreased. And
perhaps, with a little more com-
munity involvement and more
people like those already work-
ing with the program, there can
be a happy ending for these fa-
milie_s.

Anyone interested in volunteer-
ing at the shelter or on the hot-
line should contact Mary Alice or
Frank Newhams at 829-0888.

Fraternity noise prompts complaints

By Scot Ross

News Editor

A concerned group of Oakland
citizens has been working in
cooperation with several police
outfits in Pennsylvania, as well as
the Pitt lnterfraternity Council, in
hopes of eliminating the disrup-

tions in the community caused by .

University of Pittsburgh fraterni-
ty parties. .

According to Helen Schlenke
of the North Bellfield Association,
”It’s obscene to have three frater-

nities on one block and then one '

the next street, two other frater-
nities.” ‘

She remarked that in some
respects, the fraternities have
been ”completely insensitive” to
their neighbors, and regardless of
the several times she has met
with the police and the IFC, her
organization has gotten ”no satis-
faction.”

IFC President Chuck Farinella
has acknowledged the problem,
explaining that ”basically, the
disturbances from social func-
tions  have gotten to a point
where it has increased year after
year.”

Farinella said that in regards to
the noise complaints, he has met
with local citizen groups and has
corresponded with the fraternity
presidents about establishing a
list of responsibilities to aid in de-
terring future problems.

His plan includes efforts by the
Pitt fraternites, the Pittsburgh
Zone 6 Police, the Pitt Campus
Police and the citizens of the
Oakland community to work in
cooperation to improve relations

between the organizations.
Measures he addressed includ-
ed presenting citizens with phone
numbers of the fraternities so that
if there were a problem with the

noise level, the offending house »

could be contacted by phone and
police intervention could possi-
bly be avoided.

As well, he wants to create a
system where each house would
have a monitor who would, in
the event of a complaint, be posi-
tioned to answer the phone if the
local citizens believed the noise
was at an unacceptable level.

Also, the fraternities would be
required to clean up the external
portions of their property by 10
a.m. the morning after a party.

Greeks would, in addition,
need to see that their guests leave
the function in an orderly and
quiet manner. A possible solution
to this dilemma may come about
via rerouting of the campus bus
away from highly residential
areas of North Oakland, Farinel-
la said.

The IFC’s role in this program
would be to inform the fraterni-
ties of the university code of con-

duct. Workshops will be held to
discuss topics such as ”problem

guests,” ”community involv-
ment” and ”communication with
the public." I A

The Zone 6 Police will moni-
tor fraternities during social func-
tions and offer feedback to the
IFC as to where improvements
can be made.

Farinella has impressed upon
the fraternities the need to make
the community more of an ally
than an enemy through both
community involvment and con-
sideration for the community.

He said he hopes that citizens
will be made aware of this pro-
gram so that they might see the
option of calling the fraternity to
achieve an immediate response
from the individual house.

Schlenke, however, does not
see the problem being solved so
conveniently. ”The neighbor-
hood is considering anti—suits, do-
ing other things, because we
have got no satisfaction,” she
said.

”|t’s primarily the noise and the
liquor,” she added. ”We met
with them and we thought we
had it settled, and then, bingo,
one night [April 29] at 3 a.m., one
fraternity shot off all of these
fireworks.”

Schlenke said that the fraterni-
ties need to come to an agree-
ment whereby only those people
specifically invited to a party
would be admitted.

The attitude at the North Bell-

. field Association is one that wants

to see the Pitt Campus thrive, but
”|t’s just this fraternity business,”
Schlenke said.

Editor in Chief

When undercover FBI
agents need to report, they call
her. She may not dodge
bullets or make arrests, but
Sandy Hubock’s job is no less
important.

”We do get bomb scares
from time to time,” the
23-year-old Hubock said. ”I
don't really feel I'm in
danger.”

Hubock works in Pittsburgh
as a secretary for an FBI under-
cover squad designed to crack
down on organized crime and
drugs. In addition to typing
highly classified reports, Hu-
bock serves as a liaison be-
tween the undercover agents
and their supervisors. For three
years, she's been working for
the FBI, and because of the
oath she took on her first day,
she isn't permitted to talk, in-
depth, about her work to
friends or family.

Prior to our interview, she
apologized for any questions
she wouldn't be able to
answer.

”For me, the job opened my
eyes to a lot of what I was not
aware of; it was like the other
side of the coin,” she said. ’’I
now see people [criminals]
who are not as good as the
people I grew up with.”

Hubock is required to al-

An insider's look at

ways watch what she says and
does. As a safety precaution,
she can't, acknowledge any
agents outside the office. In
the office, however, she con-
siders her co-workers a second
family.

”Every [undercover] agent is
different; I'm closer to some
than others,” she said. ”We
joke around, and sometimes,
I worry about them. I'm never
frantic, though, they never let
things get out of hand.”

Each agent also works a se-
cond job. This asserving as
their cover. Every day, Hu-
bock receives calls from her
squad from practically any lo-
cation which she reports to her
supervisors. What she reports
is confidential.

”The people I work with
have a common bond with
one another,” she said. ”The
agents are out there because
they really want to help.”

Although she feels comfort-
able with her fellow workers,
Hubock said certain days are
more difficult than others.

”A lot of times, there’ll be
tension in the air, like after an
arrest, that brings everyone a
little closer,” she said.

Semester

at Sea:
Abroad
academics

By Betty Linden Sarafin
For The Pitt News

How does a semester sailing
around the world sound?
Well, that is exactly what the
University of Pittsburgh's
Semester at Sea program is all
about. And, from all reports, it
is more than an adventure —
it’s a real challenge.

Imagine I8 weeks at sea
while learning about anthro-
pology, biology, business,
economics, English, geology,
history, political science,
different cultures, you name it.

The voyage occurs twice a
year, coinciding with the fall
and spring semesters, and ex-
poses undergraduate students
to a truly unique journey.

The trip involves approxi-
mately 500 individuals drawn
from colleges and universities
across the United States, as
well as a number of foreign in-
stitutions.

Andrew Roche was one of
these students. An economics
major at Pitt, he made the trip
during his junior year, fall
semester, I987. Once an ex-
change student in Brazil,
Roche said, ”The Semester at
Sea program tops that ex-
perience.” One of his goals
was the exploration of the eco-
nomics of highly developed
foreign countries and under-
developed countries. He got a
chance to talk with a specialist
in Japan and witness the
poverty in India.

’’In the beginning I felt cyni-
cal, all the poverty. How
could I, one human being,
help to make a change?” ques-
tioned Roche, ”Now, I would
do it again. The experience
bonds you with other students
— you go through lots of per-
sonal and mental growth. I
realized I could contribute. It
really helps you realize your
role as a citizen of the world.”
He believes the academics are
as rigorous as a semester at the
Oakland campus, if not more
so. "I was shocked at the work
we had to do,” he said.

The S.S. Universe, a
Taiwanese vessel, is a verita-
ble floating campus. It in-
cludes classrooms,
laboratories, a l0,000-volume
library, closed-circuit TV sys-
tem, a theater, a physician-
staffed hospital and sports fa-
cilities.

This one-of-a-kind vessel uni-
quely transforms the world
into a classroom and exposes
students to learning ex-
periences that can not be
found elsewhere. The
semester requires a course
load of 12 to 15 units. Classes
meet six days a week while at
sea and average between 20
I and 30 students, with an em-
phasis on maximum student
involvement.

Regular courses listed in the
University of Pittsburgh cata-
log are adapted to the itinerary
for each voyage, and special
courses for various disciplines

Hazing problem absent from Pitt fraternities

By Marc Duchin
Editor in Chief

It was once tradition. It's now
against the law. Fraternity hazing
has been banned on most college
and university campuses in the
United States. Yet, some fraterni-
ties still do it, and in some cases,
a p|edge’s wish to be a brother
could prove to be fatal.

”The thing with hazing is this,
there's a lot of grey area,” said
Chuck Farinella, president of
Pitt's Interfraternity Council.

In July of 1987, Pitt established
an anti—hazing policy which de-
fines and prohibits hazing as
”any act or situation on or off
campus which recklessly or in-
tentionally endangers the mental
or physical health or safety of a
student or which willfully des-
troys or removes public or private
property for the purpose of initi-
ation or admission into affiliation
with, or as a condition for con-
tinued membership in, any or-

ganization operating under the
sanction of, or recognized as an
organization by an institution of
higher education.”

Farinella said that though the
policy prohibits it, some degree
of mental stress is neccessary
when pledging.

”|t’s a training or an orientation
in what you can expect later in
life, as far as mental stress and
how to learn to cope with it,” he
said.

In the magazine of Sigma Chi
(Spring, 1988), a 1987 survey of
700 members reported that 30
percent of chapters ”engage in
activities that are considered
’hazing.’ ” The survey failed to
define the term. Sixty-two percent
concurred that ”chapters that
haven't eliminated hazing should
be severely disciplined.” Three-
fourths agreed, however, that
”some forms of mental stress are
necessary during pledging and in-
itiation.” '

Farinella said that simple favors

According to Pitt spokesperson
Mary Ann Aug, ”The university
has not changed its comment that
the individual who filed the
lawsuit is disgruntled over having
been fi red. The university is con-
fident that there is no merit to her
allegations.”

In regards to that statement by
Pitt, Seal replied, ”A more
responsible response might have
been, ‘We are concerned over
these allegations. We don't think
that there's a serious drug
problem, but we're going to in-
vestigate.’ ”

Since her dismissal from Pitt,
Seal has taken the position of ex-
ecutive director of Campuses
Without Drugs, a nonprofit
charitable corporation.

Seal has counseled young peo-

ple on drug problems since the
19705 and was one of 2,000 peo-
ple to attend the White House
Conference on Drug Abuse last
February. She has received all
three of her degrees from Pitt and
said she still cares for Pitt very
much.

”l’ve seen kids whom I've
given scholarships to get fried on
drugs sold to them by a Pitt advi-
sor. And the Dean knew about
it,” said Seal. ”The only reason
that I filed a lawsuit is because
what was happening at Pitt was
wrong. As an institution in socie-
ty, we should be setting an
example.

’’Generally speaking, universi-
ties don't want trouble regarding
drugs. Scandals could involve te-
nured employees or unions,”
said Seal.

between brothers could be con-
sidered hazing by Pitt’s policy.
"For example, a brother asking
somebody to go down and buy
cigarettes at a store. That could be
misconstrued as hazing," he said.
”l’ve done that to people on the
street. Certainly that is not any-
where in the same kind of per-
spective as someone saying here,
drink this bottle of Jack Daniels,
everyone else has.”

Last year, James Calahan, an
18-year-old Rutgers student, died
of alcohol poisoning while pledg-
ing a fraternity. '

”Whether I felt there's some
form of hazing here that could
potentially kill somebody, as it
did at Rutgers, no, I don't think
that's going on,” Farinella said.

Penalties for hazing in Pitt's
policy include fines, restriction of

activities, suspension for a speci-
fied period or permanent revoca-
tion of certification and a possible
one-year prison term.

”Every single chapter that was
guilty of hazing on this campus
is no longer in existence/’. said
Farinella. "The university will not
tolerate it.”

”I can't see an individual, a
brother, making a mistake that
could possibly cause them to lose
their chapter or lose their house
on this campus,” he said.

Farinella said that the secrecy
common to most fraternities is a
justified tradition.

”The element of secrecy is not
there because you're doing some-
thing wrong,” he said. ’’If we told
the world what we are doing,
there would be nothing special
about us.”

Bush's campaign pushing to eliminate ‘wimp’ image

Yet another presidential elec-
tion year, and we are once again
asked to choose between two
men, one of whom will be the
leader of the free world for at
least the next four years. This
election year is, once again,
much like any of the previous,
and yet worlds apart from them
as well. The process is still the
same, as are the formalities of the
two-plus party system, but the is-
sues and the views of the world,
present and future, are immense-
Iy different, if only because of the
march of time. And so we, this
tribe of many, called Americans,
now examine our strengths and

weaknesses, our resources and
our present condition, and we de-
cide which of the two paths at
our horizon we choose to follow
into that above-cited future, and
whom we choose to lead us
down it.

This year, our two choices are
idealogically at opposite ends of
the spectrum, and the visions
they both retain for how to get to
that vast, unexplored, expansive
future differ very widely. It is true
they both wish for a future filled
with peace and prosperity, one
where generations to come will
be able to grow and prosper in a
world without fear or the threat

of war, famine or disease and

They both wish for America to be
at the forefront of that time peri-
od, as it has been for the whole
of this century and much of the
last. But who will this leader be,

CHRISTOPHER
SEPESY
'88 RACE

and how do we choose him? I
don't think we should listen to
the cliche cynicism of those pun-
dits who preach that we are
choosing the lesser of two evils,
for I, at least, believe one of our
choices is far and above more
talented, more trustworthy and
more qualified to be president
than his rival opponent.

That man is George Bush.

His record, so many times al-
ready stated by the media, stands
alone, of and by itself. His per-

sonal characteristics of faith, char-
ity, compassion, integrity,
upbringing, superior intelligence
and unyielding loyalty are un-
deniable, even by his opponents.
As well, his dedication to public
life, ranging from being twice
decorated with the distinguished
Navy Flying Cross, to being direc-
tor of the Central Intelligence
Agency, to being the first U.S.
ambassador to China, to the vice
presidency itself, is indisputable
as being an almost perfect qualifi-
cation for the top office.

But, as he has stated so many
times during this campaign, the
vice president wants the basis
and theme of this election to be
the issues. By analyzing these is-
sues and by plugging in Mr.
Bush's professed views on them,
I see a competent and consistent
blueprint for a leadership strong
enough to take this country sure-
footedly into the next decade,
and hence, to the next century.
So, keeping in step with the cam-
paign's agenda, let's look at some
of these issues.

First, George Bush says he
wants a strong defense for our
country, one which will not only

Jon Wells/The Pitt News
Republican Presidential Nominee George Bush stresses an

issue.

be able to defend our own shores
but deter opponents from the
borders of our allies as well. Dur-
ing the past four years, this agen-
da has been known as "Peace
Through Strength,” meaning that,
by having the best defense sys-
tem, we are able to ward off pos-
sible attackers. A logical plan,
and one which for the first time
since the end of World War II has
brought the Soviets to the bar-
gaining table, resulting in the
reduction of nuclear arms. But
Mr. Bush's liberal (yes, I am us-
ing the dreaded ”L-word” for all
it's worth) opponent, Mr.
Dukakis, wants an America of
lesser defense. He is positioning
a plan which, by reduction of our
own existing forces, will weaken
our nation, both at home and
abroad, from the hot spot of the
Middle East to the freedom fight-
ers of Central America. I ask you,
who now deserves the ”wimp
factor” most?

Another issue is family. George
Bush sees the family unit as be-
ing the most important basis of
civilization, and he wants the
American family unit to once ag-
gain be the prototype for the
world. He favors adoption over
abortion. Mr. Dukakis sees very
little wrong with abortion. Ge-
orge Bush wants America's chil-
dren off drugs and free from the
threat of them. He also feels that
those who pollute America with
drugs should be punished by
death. Mr. Dukakis, although he
has said he would declare a
proverbial war on drugs, gives no
decisive plan as to how he would
wage it. This prompts only skep-
ticism. George Bush wants
American children to have the
best schools in the world to at-
tend. But, unlike Mr. Dukakis, he
realizes that throwing taxpayers’
monies at the problem would
only increase it. He instead pro-
posed an internal reform.

And, lastly, George Bush wants
a strong economy. They are no
secret, the terrific strides the Rea-
gan Revolution made in lowering
taxes and creating new jobs. Or
how the standard of living is
higher now than it ever was dur-
ing the Carter years. So the basic
question here is why turn around
and go back? It is true the deficits
are too high. But under a George
Bush presidency they can be and
will be reduced, and this is
without the raising of one tax.

Perhaps you don't remember
the malaise of inflation and gas
lines, but I do. And I, for one, am
not willing to go back.

Dukakis attempting to emerge as a strong leader

At the Republican national
convention in New Orleans, the
platform Of the Democratic party
was derided as a utopian spend-
ing binge that was sure to stop the
Reagan march to prosperity.

The democrats were accused of
softening the nation's position on
defense at a time when a strong
military posture seemed to be be-
ginning to bring the Soviets into
negotiations. The Democratic
presidential nominee, Michael

Democratic Presidential Nominee Michael

his point.

Dukakis, has responded to these
criticisms by pointing to his sup-
port of the Trident ll missile and
the Stealth bomber, calling the
Minuteman a ”grOss waste.”

. Dukakis has voiced concern
about the Soviet multiple-
warhead lCBMs and has called
for observance of the 50 percent
reductions proposed in the

START treaty. Although Dukakis
has said he would support a
nuclear test ban treaty and a ban

Jon Wells/The Pittew
Dukakis making

 

on testing and deployment of
anti-satellite weapons, he agrees
that a strong nuclear arsenal is an
unavoidable requirement with
the present distribution of power.

MATTHEW
THORNTON
'88 RACE

With his proposals for cuts in
nuclear research budgets, which
he feels should not exceed $1 bil-
lion per year, Dukakis has voiced
strong support for a better—trained
and better—equipped convention-
al force. He has also promised to
seek a reduction in the number
of Soviet troops in Europe.

The Republican platform tends
to have a pronounced wariness
about the new leadership in the

Soviet Union. While he is not .

ready to embrace the Soviet po-
sition, he does seek to form part-
nerships among the superpowers

.tO fight world hunger and

disease.

The mood of optimism in the
Democratic platform is also en-
hanced by a call for cooperative
action on problems such as acid
rain, waste disposal and pollu-
tion. Dukakis sees more U.S.-
Soviet space missions if he is
elected, as well as an increased
role of the U.N. in solving region-
al disputes.

In Central America, Dukakis’
position papers are brief and to
the point: They call for an end to
the U.S. aid for the Contras and
full support for the Arias peace

plan and ”support [for] a cease-
fire, an end to outside interven-
tion, a halt to militarization,
progress toward democracy and
respect for human rights.”

Dukakis has said, in a speech
at Marquette University, that the
’’legacy of our intervention [in
Nicaragua] has been tyranny, not
freedom.

”The lesson in this is not that
our announced goals were
wrong, but that we chose the
wrong means. We put ourselves
above the law  We tried to im-
pose our views instead of helping
to build a democratic tradition.”

Clearly, Dukakis seeks to dis-
tance himself from the Iran-
Contra failure while not alienat-
ing those who Oppose the growth
of Soviet influence in Central
America. He says we ”shOwed
our neighbors a fist when they
needed a hand.” -

Dukakis has tried to emphasize
his position on education, saying
that he is more sensitive to the
educational needs of the country.
He has proposed guaranteed stu-
dent loans to all students who
need them, cutting through the
repayment problems by suggest-
ing payroll withholding based on
income, something he calls
”reverse social security.”

. Dukakis also wants to provide
college scholarships for students
wishing to enter the teaching
profession, as well as loan for-
giveness for such students.

Dukakis’ views, while not
usually, or maybe even often,
different from those Of his oppo-
nent, Vice President George
Bush, are nonetheless an expres-
sion Of a desire for some change
in the course Of government, as
well as a fair restructuring of pri-
orities.

of our Macintosh SE personal computers?
The answer, of course, depends.
  If you’ve been holding out for that -
ever-elusive combination of high performance
and affordability you’ll very likely want our ‘
Macintosh Plus. It has one full megabyte of

Translated, that means the I
Macintosh Plus can plot a statistical formula

_ or repaginate a report in the time it took you
to read this sentence.

But—if you truly want to expand
your horizons—we suggest the Macintosh SE.
It has all the attributes of the Plus, plus a little
more. Like one megabyte of  expandable .
to four megabytes. Awalloping 256K of ROM.

. As well as an expansion slot that lets you
customize the system for your particular needs.
, And to ensure you have plenty of

14-’

By Mark R. Brown

Contributing Editor

As summer comes to a
close, many of us reflect back
on beaches and barbecues.
Yet, while students lounged at
shores, Oakland provided
some entertainment of its
own. .
Pittsburgh's Department of
Parks and Recreations turned
part of Oakland into a
racetrack complete with all of
the accompanying sights,
smells and screeches of tires
not long ago. July 23 and 24
was the sixth annual Vintage
Race Weekend, dedicated to
the memory of the late mayor
Richard Caliguiri. It was a
phenomenal success.

Time trials were held on the

classes of cars. The weather
Saturday was cloudy and it
drizzled off and on, a wel-
come relief from the month-
long drought and heat wave
which settled over Pittsburgh.

A total of 120 entrants came
to Schenley Park for the race.
While competition in this
event is not bloodthirsty, it's
not a toy car show either.
Speeds attained on the

23rd for the seven different‘

straightaways reached 120
mph, the course having a
length of 2.25 miles.

The course started near 5

Phipps Conservatory, follow-
ing a winding road along the
golf course and back across
Panther Hollow Bridge where
the finish line was. Thousands
of people showed up both
days to enjoy the race. .

At the golf course, members
of local British and German
car clubs displayed their own
vehicles. The majority of them
were rarities and many of
them antiques. If you ever
drove a tiny convertible or
owned a car with a three-point
star on the hood, you would
have felt at home strolling
through the lines of beauties.
The owners each contributed
a $100 entrant's fee which
went to the Allegheny Valley
School for the handicapped.

’ The paddock area near
Phipps Conservatory was
where the pit crews fine-tuned
their cars. Walking through
there, one saw unusual cars
like the '51 jaguar XK120
owned by Nicholas Jones of
Bermuda, or favorites of mine
such as a '33 Aston-Martin Le-
Mans belonging to Richard

Schenley Park hosts Gran Prix

Stafferton of Toronto or one of
the several ’59 Porsche Speed-
sters. The pit area included
three ’33 Morgan SS Trikes
(three-wheelers), that were
produced within 100' serial
numbers of each other. Further
along were pre—war MG’s and
tiny Lotuses. Rarities such as a
'31 Bugatti, a ’29 Bentley 4.5
litre, or a '39 BMW 327/328
becam_e commonplace,

The weather for Sunday was
nearly perfect, sunny and in
the mid-80s. Thousands of
people again turned out to en-
joy the spectacle.

There were four races with
a total of six categories. The
first race was a combination of
the MG T series and the Pre-
World War II classes. George
Shafer of Somerset won the
MG Trace in his ’50 MGTD
with a finishing time of 19:27,
and Henry Wessels Ill took the
Pre-War class in his '48 Talbot
Lago GP with a finishing time
of 19:06.

The second race was the

Holiday Inn to
provide Oakland
accommodations

By Mark R. Brown

Contributing Editor

A welcome addition to Oak-
land is the new Holiday Inn, lo-
cated at Lytton Avenue and
Bigelow Boulevard across from
the Syria Mosque. Scheduled to
open in mid-September, the 10
story hotel will fill a need for ac-
commodations in the campus
area. V

The hotel will feature 253 guest
rooms, including executive suites

. with wet bars, a plush executive

boardroom, two floors of confer-
ence rooms totaling over 7,000
square feet, a grand ballroom and
a huge lounge. The hotel will also
have an indoor pool, a sauna
room and an exercise room. Each

sleeping room features remote-
control televisions and in-room
movies.

”We’re from the old school of
hotels in that the customer is the
primary concern,” said Richard
Beatty, Holiday Inn's director of
sales and marketing. The hotel
features rooms for handicapped
guests and designated non-
smoking rooms.

”Each phone will have a jack
on it so that a modem for a per-
sonal computer can be enacted.
We're one of the few hotels in
this area to offer that. Also, our
conference rooms can be hooked
into the fiber optic network,” said
Beatty. Guests will have access to
a FAX and photostat machines.

For The Pitt News

Student Government Board
President Craig Jackson has final-
ly made good on a campaign
promise to increase the number
of computers available for stu-
dent use at the University of
Pittsburgh.

The lapse of time between his
verbal resolution and reality
could best be attributed to all the
red tape that needed to be cut
through, as is the case with most
attempts at major student
resource development.

On Friday, Aug. 19, Jackson
received word from Dr. Jack Free-
man that 50 computers will be in-
stalled in Hillman Library by
mid—October.

”These computers are geared
toward students who have to do
papers. What we're thinking is
that because the computers are
located in the library, students
won't have to take sources out of
the library, making them more
accessible to everyone. That was
one of our major arguments as to
why we should have the com-
puters installed in Hillman,” said
Jackson.

Jackson has an optimistic fore-
cast for January, saying that he
hopes to have 70 additional com-
puters installed in what used to
be The Sanctuary, a property

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 29, T988

 

which was recently acquired by
the University of Pittsburgh.

The ideal situation will come,
says Jackson, when a 20—to-1
student—computer ratio is
achieved. As it stands, Pitt's ratio
is a meager 40-to-1.

At present, the University has
about 257 computers which have
been designated for student use.

’’I was meeting everybody
about this,” says Jackson.
”Another thing we're looking
into, to help solve the computer
shortage, is trying to get students
to purchase their own computers.
The University is also looking
into leasing computers.”

Jackson and his fellow board
members say they are delighted
with the outcome. ”Looks like we
got them  I can't believe it.”

Now that Jackson has one
project out of the way, he plans
to contend with the new school
year by opening up with a rather
ambitious program — one
designed to help ease racial ten-
sion at the University.

’’It seems this is the year to do
it,” says Jackson. He's elicited
help from administration and
faculty, particularly that of Dr.
Maryann Bishop Coffey of the
office of affirmative action and
Dr. Jack Daniels, vice provost.

’’I think it’s a fair assessment to
say there's some racial tension on
campus — and it’s not just black

and white,” says Jackson.

Jackson is referring to what he
perceives to be the increasing
amount of tension between Asi-
ans and whites.

Daryl Grecich, the board mem-
ber who was acting president in
the summer absence of Jackson,
also highly advocates this
program.

”We feel there are racial
problems. A lot of problems that
occur in Oakland are not from
people at Pitt, however, so we
plan to take a survey to find out
why they exist and what meas-
ures, if any, can be taken to help
them,” says Grecich.

Blueprints for such a survey are
incomplete.

The Student Government
Board also wants students to be
aware of the fact that the Univer-
sity has passed the anti-sexual
orientation discrimination clause
to the University's non—dis-
crimination policy. This addition
came about after months of
adamant lobbying by various
campus organizations, like the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance and its
sub—committees, as well as polit-
ical support from the SGB.

Another problem being ad-
dressed, once again, by SGB is
the issue’ of campus_ security.
Jackson says that ”impaCt detail”
will be in operation again this
year, a campus—city police effort.

In the aftermath of the Iran-

Pitt News speaks to

Dr. and Mrs. Posvar  

By Marc Duchin
Editor in Chief

They met at West High School
in Cleveland. She went on to
Boston to study music. He went
on to West Point Military Acade-
my to fly fighter planes. He
earned a Rhodes scholarship to
study at Oxford University. She
earned a scholarship to continue
her studies in Italy.

He ”found” her in Italy and
they toured the country together.
On one New Year’s Eve in
Munich, Germany, he took her to
an officer's club and asked her to
marry him. In the following
years, he accepted the presiden-
cy ofthe University of Pittsburgh,
and she became an opera star.

Today, their schedules are
busy. Yet, for a small part ofone
afternoon, I got the chance to
learn more about Dr. Wesley and
Mrs. Mildred Posvar.

Q: Dr. Posvar, how have you
changed from the man who was
inaugurated as Chancellor in
March of 7968?

Dr. Posvar: I'm probably the
worst person to ask. I've acquired
a great deal of experience. The
university has evolved into a very
important national institution.
The research university has be-
come more important in an eco-
nomic development sense and
this one in particular, given its lo-
cation, is a direct participant in
economic development and the
creation of jobs. It happens to be
the biggest employer in
Pittsburgh.

Mrs. Posvar: That's how the
university has changed, but he
asked how you have changed.

Dr. Posvar: Well, I have
changed in the fact that I've been
a part of this process. My percep-
tion of the institution, its impor-
tance, is much more broad and
more profound. I think there was
a time when I thought that some
people might consider being
president of the university as a
stepping stone to a government
position or to heading a founda-
tion. I no longer think those jobs
are as important.

Q: Mrs. Posvar, can you add to
that?

Mrs. Posvar: He’s certainly de-
veloped in these years as a man
of action, and he's become very
demanding. He is used to having
people do this and do that for
him. He has become a man of ac-
tion to an incredible degree and
we all try to keep up with him.

Q: Mrs. Posvar, could you tell
me a little bit about your singing
career?

Mrs. Posvar: It was very nice
while it lasted. When my hus-
band came to this position, I was
at the height of my career. That's
what we would call sold—out sea-
sons. It has been now eight years
since I sang at the Met. I have not
been singing for about five years.
I was an all—out professional for
thirty—s0me years.

Q: Dr. Ppsvar, you earned a
Bachelor of Arts and Master of

Arts in philosophy, politics and
economics as the Air Force’s first
Rhodes Scholar at Oxford. You
also recieved a Ph.D. from Har-
yard. What drove you to these ac-
comp/ishments?

Dr. Posvar: Nothing drove me.
I think I won the Rhodes scholar-
ship in a competitive way, not
really knowing what to expect. I
had not intended to be a profes-
sor. The opportunity to have the
Rhodes scholarship opened the
realm of the social sciences. I was
a fighter pilot when I went to Ox-
ford, and that's what I was really
interested in doing. It was kind of
an adjustment to change back to
the academic life. But that then
led to my appointment on the
faculty of West Point and then
later led, after I toured the Penta-
gon, to my appointment as the
first full professor of political
science at the Air Force Acade-
my, and that’s without a Ph.D. Af-
ter about eight years there, I had
an opportunity to go on sabbati-
cal, t() take two years off, to get
the Ph.D, and I firmly decided to
do that for it's own sake. I had
never felt compelled to get a
Ph.D. as a ticket or entry card to
office. Within two or three years,
I began to get inquiries about col-
lege presidencies. This came as
a surprise.

Q: What was so appealing
about being a fighter pilot?

Dr. Posvar: It’s really an end in
itself. It represents a kind of phys-
ical exhilaration, a testing of your
skills, your emotions and coordi-
nation to an almost ultimate
degree. It's very much like skiing.

Q: Do you both ski?

Mrs. Posvar: No, I sang. He
skied.

Q: Dr. Posvar, do you still ski?

Dr. Posvar: Some. I haven't had
much chance since I left the
Rocky Mountains. This is not the
greatest ski area.

Q: What do both of you like
doing together?

Mrs. Posvar:
ming, theater.

Tennis, swim-

Dr. Posvar: Cooking.
Mrs. Posvar: Cooking. Eating.

Q: What do you both enjoy
most about Pitt and the Pitts-
burgh community?

Dr. Posvar: Well, I enjoy ac-
complishing my job. I enjoy the
success of the university and its
growing prestige. I think per-
sonally we are very grateful to be
in the most liveable city in
America.

Mrs. Posvar: What I like about
being in Pittsburgh is the culture
of the city, which has just incredi-
bly improved. And I like the peo-
ple that I meet through the
university.

Q: How have students
changed over the last 20 years?

Presby leading world in organ transplant medicine

By Blake DePastino

Staff Writer

A 39-year old New York man
found a lease on life in Pittsburgh
this summer. A string of circum-
stances that threatened his life
brought him to Presbyterian-
University Hospital, where he be-
came the first American to
receive a simultaneous transplant
of both a liver and a pancreas.

At the age of 15, he underwent
surgery to correct a defect in his
heart, when he received a blood
transfusion tainted with hepatitis
bacteria. The symptoms of the
hepatitis, a disease that impairs
the liver, remained latent; in
1969, he learned that he had di-
abetes, a disease of the pancreas.
By December of 1986, he
suffered from severe liver
damage, caused by the quiet
hepatitis infection.

<\ CIMINI HAIR DESIGN

In an attempt to quell both dis-
eases, Presbyterian—University
surgeons performed a
liver/pancreas transplant, the first
of its kind in the nation. The
16-hour, four-surgeon operation
on July 1 was followed by 36
hours of intensive care; two
weeks later, both new organs
were reported as being in excel-
lent condition.

Although the liver-pancreas
procedure is not a common one,
the historic transplant well illus-
trates Pittsburgh's place in the
forefront. This is hardly the first
time that the University and city
of Pittsburgh have appeared on
the cutting edge. Why was this
medical watershed — and others
— reached in Pittsburgh?

”the nation's busiest transplant
center.” The university seems to
have earned its title. Presby was
the first hospital to handle all five
major organ transplants: heart,
kidney, heart—lung, liver and pan-
creas; today only 10 other hospi-
tals in the United States have
similar programs. And half of the
world's liver transplants are per-
formed at either Presby or Chil-
dren’s. The city's transplant
system was given yet another
boost in recent years by both the

have been designed. Problem-
centered and culturally orient-
ed courses utilize the mobili-
ty of the campus and
strengthen the talents of the
entire faculty.

Dr. Kenneth Cargaro,
professor of musical theatre at
the University of Pittsburgh,
lectured on the maiden
voyage of the Semester at Sea
program. ”lt’s a real adven-
ture," he said, and he recom-
mends students "go for it.”

Gargaro did not think it was
a good career move initially
and almost didn't go. Now he
can hardly wait to do it again.
He did not use the conven-
tional methods of instructing,
but rather encouraged his stu-
dents to keep a ledger on the
sensory experience as op-
posed to the cognitive process
of learning.

"It was not an easy trip. One
had to be ready for adven-
ture," said Gargaro. Daily, stu-
dents experienced the sunrises
and sunsets, the rising and set- M
ting of the moon and a blue
ocean as far as the eye could
see.

Another unique experience
was checking into foreign
ports and being greeted and
guided by a pilot from the
country where the ship was
about to dock. ”Everytime we
entered a new country, it was
like learning about a whole
different universe," Gargaro
said.

Paul Watson, assistant to the
executive director of Semester
at Sea, said, ’’It’s been increas-
ing with Pitt students;” they
feel it is a ’’life changing ex-
perience," and some get more
direction in their academics.

Some of the requirements
for enrollment are 2.75 QPA

Staff Writer

In the twilight of the 1960s, the
nation's campuses simmered in
discontent. And the University of
Pittsburgh was no exception. A
student group not officially recog-
nized by the university, called the
Black Action Society, had made
attempts to meet with university
officials to discuss the ”unbeara—
bly low" numbers of black stu-
dents, faculty and administrators.

They argued that the few blacks
who did attend or work at the
university had no cultural or
historical programs; their special
interests were not being ad-
dressed. But officials refused to
meet with the BAS.

At 6 p.m. January 15, 1969, the
birthday of Martin Luther King,
Jr., approximately 60 students
from the BAS, Pitt SDS, the Black
Panther Party and other groups,
seized the eighth floor computer
center. Within nine hours of
negotiations, Chancellor Wesley
Posvar agreed to several terms,
including an institution to pro-
vide financial aid and scholar-
ships to blacks, a special section

 

in Hillman Library for blacks and
two black holidays during the
academic year.

Almost 20 years later, the BAS
remains, and it is a very visible or-
ganization. Today, as BAS chair-
person Celeste Myers formally
described, the primary purpose of

”—

The past is the past.
I ’m looking to wards the
future, to what my ad-
ministration and what I
can do.

— Celeste Myers

the Black Action Society is ”to
promote a social, academic and
cultural atmosphere for the black
student; to give something for the
black students to hold on to or to
remember their history by.”

As chairperson, Myers said she
will emphasize the service duties
of the BAS. Still standing on her
”big brother, big—sister” platform,

Myers said she sees the BAS ”as
a support system for the black stu-
dent," particularly freshmen and
transfer students. By sponsoring
events like a minority jobs fair
and serving as a referral station to
administrative offices, the BAS
hopes to help new black students
use all that the university may
offer.

In the recent past, however, the
BAS has stumbled during the
spring election seasons.

In the spring of 1987, 147 votes
were contested by two defeated
candidates who questioned the
eligibility of some of the voters.
In-fighting followed, and the BAS
floundered through the last
weeks of the academic year
among internal accusations of
slander, unprofessional behavior,
and usurpation of power.

Problems arose again last
spring, when the BAS was forced
to push back the election date be-
cause some candidates did not
meet the deadline for submission
of the three letters of recomm-
mendation and 100-signature pe-
tition required for eligiblity.

Myers said she would make no

Renovations on ‘O’ complete, quality remains the same

By Rita Cordisco

For The Pitt News

Maybe your mentor will tell
you about it. Or maybe you and
your roommate will go on your
own.

Sooner or later, you will dis-
cover ”The O." ”The O,” as it’s
affectionately called, is the Origi-
nal Hot Dog Shop, located on the
corner of Bouquet and Forbes
Avenue in Oakland.

Opened in May of 1960 as
Franks and Burgers, owner Sid-
ney,Simon fondly recalls, ”we
operated on such a shoestring
budget, we couldn't afford an ex-
haust fan for the burgers.”

The Original has come a long
way. Today the Original goes
through 40,000 pounds of pota-

toes, IO0 cases of ketchup and
2000 poundsof hot dogs a week.
When asked what the biggest
selling food item was, Simon
responded, "french fries. A big
percentage of Pitt students love
our french fries. We sell the most
french fries in the state, more
even than Kennywood.”
Without a moment’s hesitation,
he quickly pointed to the enor-
mous stack of boxes containing
the potatoes which were lined
up, ready to be cut and sliced.
”We use only peanut oil,” he
added. ’’In fact, we are the only
food chain to do so. We use
peanut oil for all our frying.”
”|’ve always believed in quali-
ty,” Simon said. ”I use only the
best ingredients.”

Posvars

as manager of Station Street Hot
Dogs, Simon had ”The O’s” hot-
dogs specially made. As testimo-
ny to the success and popularity
of the ”dogs,” supermarkets
around the area arenow carrying
the Original hot dogs -— the same

 

ones used by the Original.
”Everyday,” Simon said, ”three
to four more supermarkets call
and ask to carry the Original’s hot
dogs.”
If you still prefer enjoying hot
dogs and french fries at ”the O,”

you're not alone. Approximately
4,000 people go through those
doors in one day.

”Friday and Saturday nights
from I 1 o'clock on, you can't get
in the door," said Simon. ”On

Although it's undergone some changes in the past year, The Original remains a Pitt original.

Dr. Posvar: We came here at
the period of student unrest. A
measurable number [of students]
were very, very rebellious in
thinking about institutions, estab-

I ‘ lished institutions, whether they

be government or the university
or business. For the greater part,
that sense of protest and rebellion
was unfocussed; It wasn’t until
the late 70s, we really had an op-
portunity to think in an unimped-
ed way with the development of
the institution and its growth and
its quality; looking beyond just
saving it. We had less a -anis-
festation of violence at this lace,
largely‘ because we worked very
hard at it. We did a lot of talking
and a lot of listening. But that has
changed and the young people,
almost without exception, are

civil, courteous, attractive and .

impressive.

Mrs. Posvar: We noticed a
change immediately when the
tide turned, with the students’ at-
titude and their dress and their
whole demeanor when we met
them at picnics.

Q: About a year and a halfago,
for a period of time, demonstra-
tors marched outside your home,
every Saturday afternoon, pro-
testing investments Pitt had with
companies having ties to South
Africa. What feelings did you
both experience from that?

Dr. Posvar: I felt a certain sense
of injustice on the side of the way
the protesters conducted. In fact,
people here involved with the
protest apologized privately and
said, ”We’re not angry with you,
we're engaging in a symbolic
act." One of the difficulties about
the whole divestment problem,

even though we finally did agree
to adopt a policylof divestment
for symbolic reasons, was that it
has no effect upon the practices

I of the South African government.

We knew it wouldn't.

Mrs. Posvar: I agree with his
feeling of injustice. Of all the peo-
ple to pick on,.my husband is so
understanding of that cause. The
other thing is that it's a little
nerve-wracking, and that's what
they meant it to be.

Q: If one problem could be
solved in the world, which
problem would each of you
choose to solve?

Dr. Posvar: Nuclear weapons;

Eliminate nuclear weapons. No
question.

Q: What would both of you
like to see or accomplish at the
university in the future?

Dr. Posvar: I would like to see
it continue to grow in prestige
and prominence as it has been
doing.

Mrs. Posvar: I would like to see
more housing.

Dr. Posvar: Oh, absolutely, in
terms of practical, physical needs,
student housing is the number
one concern.

Mrs. Posvar: I would like to see
a nice auditorium.

Mrs. Posvar: Either build one or
acquire one. I think Stephen
Foster is charming, but I think we
need something on a larger scale.

Q: What would both of you
like students to know about your-
selves?

Mrs. Posvar: We're human. We
live and breathe.

Dr. Posvar: That we care fun-
damentally about their welfare
and their success.

Studying all a matter of choosing the perl:ect

By Julie Shepard

The Pitt News

The muscles in your neck tense
up. You find yourself drinking

coffee or Mountain Dew uncon-

trollably. You're equipped with
pens, paper, headset, a Super Big
Gulp and your books. It's that
time —— time to actually submit
yourself to a few good hours (at
least) of quality studying time.
You're determined this time that
you will not procrastinate any-
more when it comes to keeping
up with your classes — you can
keep up! Now, since you're so
enthusiastic about this ”study
thing,” a good place to apply
yourself would be the cherry on
top of this sundae. Here's a few
suggestions: _

Hillman Library — The good
ol’ library has always been a
”study haven." You'll find that
once finals roll around, the floors
will literally be littered with stu-
dents cramming for every last bit
of knowledge they can squeeze
into their already exploding
cranial cavities. On a normal ba-
sis, though, Hillman Library pro-
motes many different study
environments.

The ground floor is your busy

floor. People coming and going,

Searching and finding. Sleeping,
studying, conversing and relax-

ing. Quite a grand facade of ac- .

tivity (or lack thereof),

The first floor is more of a so-
cial hall. Large tables that hold as
many people as can crowd
around them usually promote
many a conversation disguised as
a ”group study session.” Not a
good place to be usually if you
need to hear yourself think.

Your best bet in Hillman is
either the third or fourth floor. In-
dividual cubicles furnish one
shelf and an ample amount of
space to house a few texts and

notebooks. They also are large

enough to fit your arms and head
if you feel you need a study
break. .

The second floor has been
skipped over since the center of
it is open and overlooking the
first floor. Keep in mind, sound

floats up.
Other little conveniences of
Hillman include: change

machines on the ground floor for

Continued from page A-25
changes in the election process.
”All I can do is follow the [BAS]
constitution.”

Myers declined to comment on
the obstacles of the past two
years, declaring, ”The past is the
past. I'm looking towards the fu-
ture, to my administration and
what I can do.”

Along with deputy-chairperson
Maria Kersey, Myers will oversee
the traditional BAS functions. Af-
ter a ”Get Acquainted” weekend
in September, the BAS will host
speakers for November's Black
Week, a cultural program in Oc-
tober, King Day in January and
Black History Month throughout
February. Speaker names and
specific dates have not yet been
released.

In addition to these events,
with her ”support system” idea
in mind, Myers seeks a greater,
more active membership. ’’I want
to get students aware  [to have
them] utilizing all that the BAS
has to offer/’%

the copying machines that are
found on every floor; the Pittcat
that tells you that every book you
want is probably at a branch cam-
pus and you'll have to look in the
card catalog anyway; and the
wide variety of reference books
that tell you everything you could
possibly want to know about the
world, the cosmos and why we
do the things we do.

The Cathedral of Learning -
The next haven on the list is
found in the mighty and magnifi-
cient Cathedral — the second
tallest learning institution in the
world (the University of Moscow
built a 240-foot radio antenna on
the top of one of their institutions
to make themselves No.1, cheap
trick). A common place to study
here is in the Commons Room.
it may seem a bit gloomy and
dark, but with the aid of a can-

dle, a direct seat under the lights I

or a stronger pair of glasses, you
can get as much work done as
your little heart desires. The Com-
mons Room is open all night, but
make sure you bring your ID to
sign in and out if the campus
police are stationed at their attrac-
tive table by the gift shop.
Michael L. Benedum Hall of

‘Engineering — Benedum (as it is

often referred to) isn't a ‘bad place
to study but is sometimes limit-
ed in space. Many classrooms are
usually open and very quiet.
Sometimes, these rooms tend to
grow a bit chilly, but with a few
layers of clothing, you shouldn't
be too uncomfortable. If you're
lucky, the vending room on the
main level will be open and the
supply of microwave popcorn
will still be holding its own. A
microwave is available for pop-
ping this corn — not to worry.

Forbes Quadrangle — Five
floors support many relatively
new classrooms and lounges on
the old site of Forbes Field. Com-
fortable chairs are found in many
of these areas, too. A snack bar
is available but is not open ’til all
hours of the night. Often you get
chased out around 11 p.m., too.
For a study break in Forbes Quad,
it's always fun to go check out
home plate embedded in the
floor on the first level. You can
just hear the crowds roar as you
step up to the plate. 

David Lawrence Hall — David

Lawrence isn't too bad of a place-

ATTENTION EYE-GLASS WEARERS!

  

to hang out when you're racking
your brains. But again, it is some-
what limited on space. The com-
puter room upstairs is fantastic,
though, since it supplies one of
the only laser printers available to
students. Vending machines near
the main doors are also at your
disposal. '

William Pitt Union — If you're
a member of a student organiza-
tion, the Student Union is a hot
spot in the study world. Even if
you're not part of approximately
200 student groups that Pitt sup-
ports, the Union is still a hot spot.
Many services and edibles are
available to all as they engulf
themselves in the only building
on campus that has a staircase go-
ing nowhere. If you're going to
study all night at the Union, you
may have to join a student group
to get an after-hours pass.

Scaife Hall — A common spot ,

for medical students, Scaife has a
cafeteria and at good deal of room
to study ’til the cows come home.
Scaife is usually pretty quiet with
the exception. of janitors’ vacu-
ums sounding off from time to
time. A

The Port Authority Transit Bus
—— If you're coming in from some-
where that isn't real close to our
fine institution and if you can
block out all kinds of noise, a
PAT bus may be the place for you
to attain some smarts. l wouldn't
advise trying to spread your junk
out all over the place, but a book
that fits nicely in your lap can do
some good. Be sure to hold on
tightly to that book, though, as
many bus drivers’ driving will
throw you from one sideof the
bus to the other.

The Cathedral lawn — ”The
lawn” is not too bad of a study
resort if you want some fresh air
and sunshine. Oftentimes, you
can check out the babes lying in
the sun or the dudes playing foot-
ball over yonder. ”The lawn” is
not a good place in rain, sleet,
snow or cold, though. Keep that
in mind. ,

The Sidewalk 7 On the way to
your exams, you sometimes need
”just five more minutes.” Get
them on the concrete on the way.
This area can be kind of tricky
since you are not really actively
looking for other people, build-

ings, cars, buses, trees, etc. that .

might end up in your way. These
things can be awful distractions.
So in order to avoid them, be sure
to look up occasionally to be on
the safe side. Use your peripher-
al vision, too.

Your room — Last but not least,
you need to consider studying in
your room. It's not always the
best place to study due to blast-
ing stereos, noise, people running
in the hall (who weren't cured of
that in grade school), ringing
phones, nearby TVs and a varie-
ty of other little interruptions. If
you're in the right place, though,
at the right time, you just might
get a lot of work done. The

location

phones turn off, noise and activi-
ty tend to die down as the night
grows old, good TV shows aren't
scheduled really late at night and
you usually have all the essentials

One last fine feature that con-
stitutes the saying ’’all the com-
forts of home," is that once you
decide that you can continue no
further with this educational
process that should allow you to
have a ’’real job" in the "real
world" when you ”grow up,”
you can just climb under your
ow_n sheets and go to sleep
without worrying about your
arms going numb because you've
slept on them all night.

Cathedral

Continued from page A-7
you'll see birds living in the al-
coves. There was once a bat on
the 17th floor.

”Somebody once told me that
he thought this place was haunt-
ed,” Weber said.

In fact, one of the workers in
the Cathedral said that another

custodian told her that he saw a
ghost. '

Whether it involves the ghosts,
the storms or the occasional flick-
ering lights, the Cathedral of
Learning remains not” only as a
landmark but also as a potpourri
of trivial information for the
University of Pittsburgh com-
munity.

AIDS

Continued from page A-3
a mailed questionnaire once ev-
ery six months over a period of

. two and'a half years.

Some of the participants are
then asked to be part of a second
study which includes a more
detailed questionnaire, a physical
examination, specimens of body
fluids, viral studies, tests of immu-
nity and follow-up visits to the
study site every six months.

Test results are completely con-
fidential. All specimen contain-
ers, questionnaires, clinical
records and reports are number
coded, rather than identified by
name. Participants have the op-
tion of knowing their own test
results.

A pamphlet issued by the Pitt
Men’s Study reports that: ”With
AIDS, the body’s immune sys-
tem,
againstdisease, is impaired. Dis-
ease germs that would not usual-
Iy cause illness now become life
threatening to the patient. AIDS
patients may also develop certain
cancers.”

The Pitt Men’s study has com-
piled alist of signs and symptoms
of AIDS which includes the fol-
lowing:

O Unexplained, increasing and
persistent fatigue.

0 Periodic or regular fevers,
shaking chills or drenching night
sweats that last longer than sever-
al weeks.

O Weight loss that is unexpect-
ed, occurs in less than two
months and is greater than 10
pounds

0 Swollen glands, with or
without pain (usually in the neck,
armpits or groin) that last more
than two weeks.

0 Pink to purple, flat or raised
blotches or bumps (usually pain-
less) occuring inside the mouth,
nose, eyelids or rectum. Initially,
they may look like bruises that do
not go away. They are usually
harder than the skin around
them.

0 Persistent white spots or un-
usual blemishes in the mouth.

0 Persistent dry cough that is
not from smoking and has lasted
too long to be caused by a com-
mon respiratory infection.

normally the guardian‘

0 Persistent diarrhea.
O Shortness of breath that is
new and getting worse.

I (The Pitt Men’s Study urges
anyone with these symptoms to
see a physician familiar with
AIDS and to contact The Pitt
Men’s Study by calling
624-2008.)

The U.S. Public Health Service
recommends that you be con—.-
fidentially counseled and tested
if you have had any sexually
transmitted disease or shared nee-
dles; if you are a man who has
had sex with another man; or if
you have had sex with a prosti-
tute, male or female.

You should also be tested if
you have had sex with anyone
who has done any of these things.

Your physician may advise you
to be tested for the AIDS virus if
you are a hemophiliac or have
received a blood transfusion be-
tween 1978 and 1985.

Anyone who tests positive for
the AIDS virus is advised by the
Public Health Service to take

steps to protect his or her sexual
pannen

The test ‘for AIDS does not ac-
tually indicate whether or not a
person has AIDS. It determines
whether he or she has been in-
fected with the virus and looks for
changes in blood that occur after
infection.

”Let’s Talk About AIDS,” a
brochure .distributed by the
American Society of Internal
Medicine, warns that: ”Although
a positive test means you have
been infected with H.I.V., it
doesn't necessarily mean you will
develop AIDS. But it does mean
you can pass the virus to others
who then may develop AIDS.”

As stated by the American So-
ciety of Internal Medicine: ’’It
cannot be overemphasized that,
with AIDS, ignorance is not bliss;
it's deadly. The key is to under-
stand how the disease is transmit-
ted and I how to take
precautions.”

be associated with an individual,
that person might be Dr. Thomas
E. Starzl.

Starzl, 61, who headed this
summer's liver/pancreas trans-
plant team, first gained recogni-

tion in the medical community in Q

1967 when he performed the
world's first liver transplant at the
University of Colorado. Two

years after leaving Denver for.

Pittsburgh in 1981, Starzl became
the first to use the new anti-
rejection drug cyclosporine with
steroids, which proved to be a
very successful regimen. He also
devised a standardized method of
removing organs from cadavers,
now called the ”Pittsburgh
Technique.”

But the acclaim the city

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 29, I988

receives today is the accomplish-
ment of many more Pittsburgh
physicians and their years of
labor. Dr. Henry Bahnson, for ex-
ample, performed the city's first
heart transplant. Dr. Thomas
Hakala, kidney transplant pi-
oneer, is also integral to a
thorough discussion of Pittsburgh
medicine, as are Drs. Robert
Hardesty and Bartley Griffith for
their work with artificial hearts as
bridges to transplantation.

As a result of such advance-
ments, said Brian Broznick, ex-
ecutive director of the Pittsburgh
Transplant Foundation, the trans-
plant industry has blossomed.
”As the technology grows, so do
the transplant opportunities,”
Broznick said, citing the use of
cyclosporine and‘ better organ

preservation techniques as
growth factors. This healthy spurt
(twice as many transplants done
last year as in 1982) in the field

is reflected in the Foundation's ‘

expansion.

”_

As technology grows,
so do the transplant op-
portunities.

— Brian Broznick

ll

Since its establishment in 1978
for the procurement of kidneys,
the Pittsburgh Transplant Founda-
tion has been recovering more
and different materials to accom-

modate the area's burgeoning de-
mands. In 1980 Broznick
recounted, ”when the cardiac
transplant program was inaugu-
rated, we began to handle hearts.
In 1981 when Starzl came and
brought the liver program, we
started handling livers.” And two
years ago, the Foundation initiat-
ed the recovery of tissues and car-
tilage as well. Today, although
the Foundation services the tri-
state area (east to Chambersburg,
north to Elmira, N.Y., parts of
West Virginia and Ohio), it is also

part of a larger network that ena- .

‘bles it to send organs and tissues

anywhere in the United States.
and Canada.

administrative assistant at Presby,

.Baby Wanted

Couples turn to classified ads in search of child adoption

By Rich Cholodofsky

Staff Writer

One would expect to find Help
Wanted ads and apartment ads in
the classified section of a
newspaper. Recently, however, a
new type of want ad has ap-
peared.

These days, it is not uncom-
mon to see couples advertise in
a newspaper to adopt a child,
bypassing the more common

. adoption agencies.

A couple in the Pittsburgh sur-
burbs named Bob and Joyce ad-
vertise in several newspapers,
including The Pitt News.

Bob and Joyce have been mar-

' ried five years and are unable to

have a child. They have been told

7 by adoption agencies that it could

take anywhere from five to eight
years for them to get their baby.
”We decided to go indepen-
dent because many agencies
don't like to give children to cou-
ples who are over 39, and in five
to eight years I will be 39.
”For most people who have
pursued independent adoption, it
has taken about one year; the lon-

gest I have heard was two years,”
Joyce said.

The couple has been advertis-
ing since April.

”We would like to keep con-
fidentiality in case the mother
wants to take the baby back. We
would rather not meet the
mother."

There has been some response
to their ads.

’’I thought for sure we had our
baby. A girl called us and told us
to have our lawyer contact her.
When we called back, it turned
out to be a women's shelter and
she was nowhere to be found,”
Joyce said.

There have been six responses
to the ads. According to Joyce,
three of those responses have
been from college students.

”A lot of coeds are job orient-
ed. A baby wouldn't be appropri-
ate for them at this time.

”Everybody’s story is different.
Two or three were impoverished.
The last one to call sounded like
she wanted someone to take care
of the baby for her.”

The ”deal” that Bob and Joyce
are offering consists of paying

medical expenses only after the
baby is placed in their home.
Pennsylvania law only allows for
medical expenses tobe paid.

"We refuse to get involved in
the selling of babies. I don't be-
lieve in buying babies. We are
basically there as a help to
them.”

The fact that Bob and Joyce are
unable to have their own child
has affected their views on such
issues as abortion.

”We are against abortion. The
fact that we cannot have a child
just enforces our feeling. We feel
it is needless when there are
enough other people are willing
to take that baby.”

Another couple who have gone
the private adoption route are
Lou and Andrea, from New Jer-
sey. They have placed ads in
newspapers in many areas of the
country such as Texas, Iowa and
in The Pitt News.

Lou and Andrea, who are in
their mid-30s, have been looking
for a child for the last two years.

”We have had very few
responses, so we have stopped
the ads for a while," Lou said.

The hotel will employ 180
workers on an annual payroll of
over $2 million. Beatty said that
the Pitt student population will
probably form a substantial part
of the labor force there.

”We’re the new guys on the
block, and we're trying to be
good neighbors. We joined the
Oakland Business and Civic Ad-
ministration,” said general

- manager Dennis Burrell.

”The boardroom is permanent-

_ ly set and can accommodate I6

stained glass ceiling panels and
can sit 400 people. National De-
velopment spared no expense

expected from the state
’’would go towards student aid

Our salaries have not kept up
with the the national salary
level.’’

The tuition increase,
however, is not expected to
adversely affect student admis-
sions. According to Dr. Betsy
Porter, director of admissions
and financial aid, ”The
dropout rate should be no
more than would be typical in
any other year.

”New students have been
admitted and committed be-
fore tuition announcements,"
Porter said. ” We advise stu-
dents that they ought to antic-
Ipate a tuition increase.”

_ Porter indicated that addi-
tional money received from
the state could be used to
reduce tuition in the winter
term or be channeled into stu-
dent aid to provide more relief

to students seeking money.

as he showed off the $15,000
brass chandelier in the lobby. He
said that National Development
also runs Webster Hall, so they
are not new to providing services
to Oakland and Pitt students.
’’National Development was
concerned that this hotel be aes-
thetically pleasing as much as it
is functional to the community.
Our underground parking garage
can hold 400 cars, so we're real-
ly not adding to the parking con-
gestion here,” said Beatty.
Beatty said that they want to be
partners with Pitt as well as the
other local colleges. The Holiday
Inn's features can attract seminars
and workshops, and it can pro-
vide accommodations to those
here for weekend football games
and Homecoming. ”We’re also

looking into Pitt's school of busi-
ness using us as a marketing
study. We're an opportunity and
a resource,” said Beatty.

The Foster Bar and Grill will
feature an exposed food line that
is New York style. It can sit 180
people and will have regular jazz
entertainment. A large selection
of imported beers will supple-
ment the normal array of drinks.

”We’re open for business now
and taking reservations. The price
for a room will be $85.00 a night,
but we're going to have a lower
introductory rate for the first few
months. We'll be offering special-
ly priced packages and taking
group business, like wedding
receptions and business meet-
ings,” said Beatty.

Lou and Andrea said they have
spent anywhere between $400
and $500 a week. ”When you
start to run ads all over the coun-
try it becomes as expensive as an
agency.”

Lou said that the reason for go-
ing the private adoption route
was other people's success.

”We’ve known many people
who were successful. Another -

A-3 I

reason is that it gives the birth
mothers an opportunity to choose
the family,” Lou said.

He added, "I think a lot of girls
would rather carry their baby
than have an abortion."

Joyce feels that all the advertis-
ing is worth it.

’.’We will look until the day a
baby is in our home," she said.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Opinions expressed herein are not necessarily those of the student body,

faculty or university administration. Opinions expressed in Columns, cartoons

and letters are not necessarily those of The Pitt News. Editorials expressed
are a majority opinion of the Editorial Board, listed below.

A question of our
mission as students

Since it is the beginning of a new year, we thought it wise «

to make some statement of editorial position in this space con-

cerning the university. , T
First, we are in no way under the directionof the university

or any university official concerning the matter printed in this

section. We are both editorially and financially independent '

of Pitt. .

When we speak of the university, the opinions are our own,
as students, not as members of the university staff. In that light,
please allow us to present a summary of our estimation of our
school.

Pitt receives a substantial amount of public money from the
state, approximately $107 million. In light of this fact, we feel
it reasonable to evaluate Pitt as a publiclinstitution, and we feel
compelled to hold it to a standard which reflects the interests
of the public, rather than those of any specific interestgroup.

The main mission of a public university should be the edu-
cation of its undergraduates. Most of those attending college
acquire only a baccalaureate degree, and Pitt should be dedi-
cated to serving the needs of thatmajority. We do not wish
to imply that the university should deny the graduate programs

and research efforts of the school their rightful emphasis, but I

that they should instead endeavor to give equal attention to
all levels of education. . I c

There has been significant discussion at Pitt about the merits.
of the ”trick|e-down” theory of funding, namely that increased
funding of the research graduate education efforts will attract
better-qualified faculty members and produce an environment
more conducive to undergraduate education. _

While it is true that some schools, usually small, private in-

I stitutions such as Johns Hopkins, have enjoyeda measure of

success employing such an operating theory, there is very lit-
tle evidence to show a noticeable increase in undergraduate

outcome when that theory is applied to a larger institution. Pitt E

should dedicate itself to hiring faculty members who are first
and foremost teachers, whose primary goal is the education
of their students, and not the enhancement of their curriculum
vitae. — .

Because the primary goal of any school should be the edu-
cation of its students — not the glorification of its football team
or its place as an international showpiece —— the university
would be well served to see that every teacher has a command
of the English language that at least parallels that of his or her
students.

Ideally, education should be a joint endeavor of the students
and the faculty. Hopefully, faculty members have chosen their
professions based on a desire to educate, and students come
to the university to learn.

There is a wealth of opportunity available at Pitt; the many
student groups, the human resource of information represent-
ed in the faculty, the unparalleled access to new ideas. When
students approach their education with an attitude of ”l’l| only
pay attention to the courses that seem to apply to my chosen
field,” they blind themselves in their dogmaticism.

None of us, the faculty, staff, students or administration,
should be simply putting in time. There is far too much at stake,
both in terms of effort and possible outcome, to have any par-4
ticipant in the university be willing to take shortcuts on the ardu-
-ous path to prominence.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 29, I988

We are becoming victims of mental stagnation

There seems to be an increas-
ing sloganization of thought in
America. With easy confrontation
taking the place of conversation,
we have sold our thoughts for the
dubious reward of quick securi-
ty and easy answers.

At the meticulously
choreographed Republican na-
tional convention in New
Orleans, the crafting of the ”just
say no” to the Democrats
proverb was pronounced a rous-
ing success._The Democrats, at
their own made-for-TV political
foray, asked the ”Where was Ge-
orge” question at least as often as
they questioned the platform they
were embracing. Martin Luther
King's observation that injustice
anywhere is a threat to justice
everywhere has been subverted
to give moral grounding to even
the most blatant intervention.

On television, advertising has
begun to invade the aesthetic
consciousness previously
reserved for art. Thirty—second
commercials, often having larger
production budgets than the
prime—time shows they support,
have become more than paid
spokesmen for the companies
they represent. -Ads are vignettes
of Americanlife, or at least some
idealized version of that life.

In the Levi's 501 campaign,

. reasonably traditional blues mus-

ic is torn from its history to set the
stage for sales efforts: music born
of pain and frustration now pro-
vides an aural environment in
which $40-dollar trousers are
hawked as the choice of the new-
ly chic urban nomadic set.

A few years ago, asking after
status of the beef became a
pastime for millions of people,
describing situations from politi-
cal policy disputes to current
trends in pop music.

When asked to give their
”philosophies of life’', many peo-
ple can respond in a sentence or
less. You can't take it with you;
live close to God; don't let the
bastards get, you down. Pressed
for details, most could certainly
give some greater expansion on
those themes, but the explana-
tions themselves often take the
form of polished one-liners.
”Wel|, you know, it's like, here
today, gone tomorrow — you
might as well go for it while
you've got the chance.” The ends
justify the means, we have been
told, and since Nietzsche, the fu-
tility of the ends has served to
justify almost any means.

To be sure, language is not the
exclusive domain of this slogani-
zation. Evidenced by magazines
like Life, the photograph has
served as the final distillation of
an argument. A picture of a mur-

dered Catholic priest in Northern
Ireland can become the final
word in a complex religious-
political dispute withits roots in
the unilateral violence of the past.
With the propagation of
homogenized mass media, a pic-
ture of a mid-sized protest march
could be shot so as to give the il-
lusion of large participation. A
single glance through the
camera's lens has taken on the
power of justification, of expla-

MATTHEW
THORNTON

I do not mean to say that pho-
tography is intrinsically to blame
for this sort of phenomenon, nor
are those who craft the sentences
to which we defer our thought.
Like a seminal protest song being
harnessed to the running shoe in-
dustry, concise thought has been
cut free of its origins, allowed to
drift dangerously along the rough-
edged ramparts of popular
opinion.

Allen Bloom, in his book The
Closing of the American Mind,
argues that we have become

When I was in high school, we
used to call guys like Dan Quayle
”square.” But that was before the
sexual revolution, which led to
such social problems as abortion,
venereal disease and record num-
bers ofdivorces. Now, ”square”
is looking a lot better. (Even
Dukakis and Bentsen are trying to
look square.)

As expected, the critics waited
little time before starting their dis-
section of the Republican vice
presidential nominee. Some crit-
ics say Quayle is too young for
the job, just as they said Ronald
Reagan was too old. Have they

prisoners of moral relativism, that
we have lost our societal bearings
by admitting that we may not be
right, or even justified, in our
opinions. To Bloom, there needs
to be some foundation of widely
acceptable morality if a society is
to succeed. Certainly, the Reagan
years have provided us with
some common moral ground, but
one is forced to wonder about the
quality of the view from the
lowest valleys of societal agree-
ment. The notion that one’s coun-
try is ”great” may be gratifying,
but it serves usually to propel us
toward xenophobia. The slogan
is easy — ”America the Beauti-
ful” rolls without effort from our
tongues — but the implication is
necessarily that America is better
than the others, that America has
some special right to impose it-
self, simply because _it is great.
This sort of thinking can be ac-
complished with startlingly little
effort, much like being swept
away in a hurricane. I

Too often, we are content to al-
low whatever information is
presented most vigorously to
weigh heaviest in our thoughts
and decisions. By choosing to
rely on encapsulated thought, we
have limited our range of possi-
ble opinions to only those easily
available in a popular culture
geared to an eighth-grade edu-
cation.

It is a reasonable assumption
that every college student has the
ability to read. It should be his or
her most valued faculty. In a
library, there is evidenceof thou-
sands of hours of thought on ev-
ery shelf. We have access to
more information each day than
we could ever hope to assimilate.

Faced with such a situation, it
is a wonder that we continue to
let our limited class assignments
and reruns of television comedies
suffice for our education. It is sim-
ple to depend on MTV for
philosophical guidance, but I
have to think there is more to
learning than acceptance of the
most palatable bromide
available.

Matthew Thornton is the per-
spective editor for The Pitt News.

to have convictions?

convictions are now labeled as
”intolerant,” while those who be-
leve in nothing are termed
”pluralistic.” This is the ”new—
think” about which George Or-
well warned.

The New York Times calls
Quayle an ”ideologue." But
”ideologue” comes from ”ideol-
ogy,” which is defined as ”the
study of ideas, their nature and
source,” and even better, ”the
doctrines, opinions or way of
thinking of an individual, class,
etc.; specifically, THE BODY OF
IDEAS ON WHICH A PARTICU-
LAR POLITICAL, ECONOMIC
OR SOCIAL SYSTEM IS BASED”
(emphasis mine).

The primary reason why the
Dukakis-Bentsen ticket is so un-
specific in its plans for America's
future is that it has no base for its
body of ideas.

So, who is Dan Quayle, and
what gives him his base of ideas?
One clue comes from thexplace
where Dan and Marilyn Quayle
spend their Sundays (and Fri-
days). The Quayles are members
and regular attenders at McLean
Presbyterian Church in McLean,
Va. Marilyn Quayle attends a Fri-
day Bible study class with about
20 other women who are married
to members of Congress and the
Cabinet. Ironically, the group

meets at the home of Jack and

Joanne Kemp.

Evangelical and fundamentalist
Christians are one of the major
target groups for the Republican
ticket. Pollster George Gallup has
estimated there are as many as 50
million of them. Many are
Democrats, and many ofthem
respond positively to those like
Dan and Marilyn Quayle who
don't sleep in on Sunday morn-
ing. The perception that Baptist
churchgoer Jimmy Carter was
”one of us” led many in this
group to vote for him in I976. In
a close election, Quayle’s un-
apologetic faith could attract re-
ligious Democrats to the
Republican ticket in numbers

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 29, I988

   

Learning to be ourselves can be difficult, painful

I don't believe it's possible for
a person to go through four years
of college and graduate the same
person that he or she was com-
ing in. I'm not certain that peo-
ple realize the changes that they
are experiencing during their first
year away from home.

I know that I watched some of
my friends evolve into different
people during my freshman year.
But I didn't see anything new in
myself until the summer after-
ward when my high school
friends, people that I’d known
most of my life, seemed like
strangers to me.

I thought about the ways in
which they'd changed and began

to examine myself more closely v

in search of similar changes.
I noticed some pretty arbitrary
stuff at first. My musical tastes had

changed. I began to find Janis
Joplin more appealing than the
Pet Shop Boys. I had become
more into '60s music in general.
I found myself digging through
my mother's dusty album collec-
tion in search of Derek and the
Dominoes and the Rolling
Stones. When I was in high
school, no one could have con-
vinced me that I'd be listening to
’’classic tracks” today.

I also noticed that I'd become
less concerned with other peo-
ple’s opinions of me. I dressed
differently, and I was more open
with people, less intimidated by
strangers. One of the advantages
of leaving a small hometown, I
guess.

But I gradually became aware
of more significant differences.

I found myself doing a few

things that I had previously
adamantly objected to and fre-
quently lectured against. I was
more open to experimentation,
new ideas and allowing others to
”do their own thing,” so to
speak. It dawned on me that I ha-
ven’t the right to approve or dis-

MINDY
BOFFEMMYER

(aipprove of what others choose to
o. .

For example, I had always con-
demned drug use on principle.
Then I considered the fact that
many great minds — Poe, for in-
stance — have been influenced
by drugs. He may have beenian
unhappy character, but I can't say

thatje wasted his life. Nor did
countless other literary, musical
and political figures that I could
name. So I decided I had no right
to say that drugs influenced soci-
ety in an altogether evil manner.
I realized that I could decide for
myself whether or not to allow
drugs to enter my life, as could
everyone else.

I had come to college with
what I perceived to be a very firm
set of values and opinions. I
thought I had a pretty clear under-
standing of right and wrong and
a few good theories on how to
solve the problems in the world.

What I didn't realize was that

- I, like many people my age, had

inherited those beliefs from my
parents and the others around me
without giving the issues them-
selves very much thought. I real-

ized that when talking to people
about politics, religion, etc., I was
sure about what I believed in, but
I didn't always quite understand
why I felt the way I did.

I was merely repeating a lot of
empty, worn out arguments like
a parrot. This seemed pointless,
since it evoked bland conversa-
tion, rather than thought.

All of these realizations dis-
turbed me greatly, at first. I wasn't
exactly excited about the idea of
rethinking the entire scheme of
things when I had become rather
comfortable with my own ig-
norant little scheme through the
years.

I had come to a point where I
was attacking my own liberal
views and even questioning my
religion, the one thing that I had

ArguingshouIdn’t be such adangerous sport

We all do it. Many of us do it
10 or 15 times a week. Some are
better at it than others. It's excit-
ing, invigorating and challenging.
It's tradition, and it has enabled
our society to progress. Like it or
not, if you want to survive in the
world, you better know _how to
argue.

The art of arguing is an ac-
quired skill. It takes years to truly
season one’s communicative

ability. From the moment of our

first temper tantrum, we experi-
ment with thousands of verbal
strategies. We learn to seek out
opponents’ weaknesses, lead

them to contradiction and crush
their words like bugs on the
sidewalk.

As children, our topics of argu-
ment changed with each recess at
school. Who is the fastest runner
in class? Who has the strongest
Dad? Who is the best—Iooking girl
at school?

Our first peer confrontations
were clumsy. When in doubt in
a heated disagreement, we insult-
ed our opponent's clothes, face
and mother. The victor was the
one who wasn’t crying to the
teacher.

As we grow older, our styles

 

MARC
DUCHIN

may change, but the sweet, ad-
dictive taste of besting another in
a war of words still remains.
Our classroom education only
provides us with the means to
function in a fair, civilized world.
A world far from reality. It is on

-the playgrounds and in the ar-

cades that we discover the truth
and drive behind our species.
Competition is the real teacher.
We label our importance in life
through comparing ourselves to
others. Physical superiority is a
temporary luxury. Our only
chance to hold importance wi-
thin our society is through in-

tellect. Whether it's sports trivia
or human anatomy, knowledge is
a vast area and always available.
Testing our knowledge against
another’s provides a brutal but
glorious arena.

Ideally, an argument leads to a

peaceful resolution. Yet, the real
prize of winning an argument is
not the answering of a controver-
sial question, it is the rush of
power one feels when he or she
changes another’s course of
thinking. Just ask Big Brother; it's
easy to physically force someone
to act. Thinking, however, is the

Todd Condron has been the editori-
al cartoonist for The Pitt News for the
past year. During that time, he has
generated a body of work that has
won wide acclaim from nearly all
parts of the university.

In the Winter term, a national student
newspaper called the U. ran one of his
cartoons in a feature of the best
editorial cartoonists in the country. He
has also won the Leo Koberlein award,
an award sponsored by The Pitt News
for outstanding achievement. In Sep-
tember, another of Todd's cartoons will
be published in the U.

Starting in the fall term, there will be
a daily cartoon strip drawn by Con-
dron in The Pitt News. In this section, we
wish to reprint some of the best of Todd
Condron, so that we can all enjoy his
funniest work again.

The history of the world through the beer glass

”A beer, a beer, my kingdom
for a beer! Give me your tired,
your poor, your Miller pounders.
Ask not what you can do for your
Moosehead, but what your
Moosehead can do for you.”

Yes, it's true. Beer is history,
history is ‘beer. These historical
quotes have been transcribed
from Bar Lee Hops 1966 classic,
”Beer as a Political Ally.”

Contrary to popular belief, beer
is a constitutional right of U.S.
citizens. Just-read the Constitu-
tion. ”The right to slurred
speech.”

But let's not get ahead of our-
selves here. Beer has been
around much longer than just the
19th century. Actually, Borg, the
first of the Neanderthal presi-
dents, is credited with discover-
ing the wonderous euphoric

beverage that rules our lives.

Borg, however, was not privy
to the technological advance-
ments we know today. He was
forced to eat the barley, hops,
malt and grain that constitute our
national drink.

Beer made its debut in liquid
form three hours later when
friends found Borg behind the
cave, praying to some god (he
who we call the porcelain god to-
day) while bent over the clan’s
outhole.

His clan found itself fascinated
with the frothing mess Borg’s
concoction had created. While
the women of the clan huddled
around Borg, soothing his sweat-
ing brow, Romgul, the clan elder,
schemed to make something of
the combination that had made
Borg giddy, bold and remarkably

”touchy—fee|y,” and use it on the
unsuspecting babes.

Soon enough, Romgul brewed
up a beverage we know today as
”Old Milwaukee,” slipped it into
the chicks’ drinking cups and,
later that evening, donned a pink
fedora and started the world's ol-
dest profession.

The next major beer occur-
rence was not until Plymouth
Rock. Upon landing in the
Mayflower, The Pilgrims noticed
native Indians burying fish in the
ground.

But upon closer inspection, the
Pilgrims found that the Indians
were actually stuffing long—neck
Budweisers into the fish, and
burying them in easily accessible
spots, so that should they partake
in» a late night tomahawk toss
and/or drinking binge, they could
always find that extra beer or two
that would send them over the
top and into euphoria.

Of course, the most famous of
all beer parties was the Boston
Beer Party. The British sent ship
upon ship of Bass Ale to Boston
in hope of inebriating all of the
colonists and shipping them back
to Great Britain. The colonists
learned of the ploy, and contrary
to popular belief, stole (not

MARTIEY A ROSEY

dumped) the beer, rebottled it,
and began marketing Samuel
Adams Pilsner.

Beer made its mark in literary
history as well. Everyone knows
that Herman Melville wrote
Moby Dick while under the in-
fluence. The sea symbolizes the
great amount of alcohol he con-
sumed in a short period of time,
and the White Whale embodies
the punishing, powerful sensa-
tion he felt in his gut only a few
hours later. Ahab was the bar-
tender, and Melville killed him
later in the night when he
smashed a whiskey bottle over
his head and tied him to the back
of the biggest woman in town.

The most crucial period in the
history of beer was the United
States Civil War in 1861. Sparked
by the ”Less Filling, Tastes Great”
debate at the 1860 Democratic
Convention, brothers were at
each others throats trying to
prove their point. Soon, the coun-
try was up in arms. The Confeder-
ates, armed with rifles and kegs
of Dixie and Billy Carter beer,
seceded from the States, but
decided to march into the Union
to take the Utica Brewing Plant in
Utica, N.Y.

President Abraham Lincoln in-

tervened, throwing a huge party
at Appomattox. There, he deli-
vered the Gettysbeer Address,
which unified the North and
South and created a new brand
of suds — Red, White and Blue.

Beer was almost lost to the
world in the late 1960s, thanks to
the drug culture. But as the un-
grateful hippies died out, beer
returned to its rightful spot at the
top of the altered world state.

Then came Watergate, the
greatest of all politically inclined
beer sins. Richard Nixon was
caught emptying half a can of
brew into the sink during an all-
night card game in the Oval
Office, a mortal sin to any beer
drinker. Nixon resigned under
pressure from the Department of
Kegs, Bottles and Cans, since no
one wanted a president who
didn't drink beer to the last drop
— of the last can of the last case.

But, in his ultimate wisdom,
Gerald Ford, a teetotaler,
pardoned Nixon and funded a
portrait that now hangs in the
Beer Drinkers Hall of Fame at the
Hudepohl Plant in Cincinnati.

But that's all in the past. Who
are our beer heroes today? Is it
Mark Harmon, the Coors King, or
Paul Hogan, who represents Aus-
tralia’s finest? Or maybe Joe Pis-
copo, that ever-changing Lite
Beer man.

Of course, if it was left up to
Dennis Hopper, the entire coun-
try would be drinking Pabst Blue
Ribbon. To each his own.

But we’re not picky. Give us
Stoney’s or give us death. And let
us leave you with this thought: A
Heineken in the hand is worth
two Schaefer’s in the bush.

What do they do with’ all that money anyway?

Mayor Koch of New York City
issued a statement in mid—August
telling the people of his city not
to give money to beggars. He said
this because he had somehow
come to the conclusion that not
everyone who was out there on
the streets begging was actually
using the money they received
for food. Ed Koch said that some
of the beggars were actually us-
ing the money to buy drugs and
alcohol. A

Needless to say, liberals came
out of hiding to denounce Koch
for his statement. The detractors
all agreed that there was some
truth to what Koch said, but they
also stated that the number of bad

apples in the beggar community‘

was relatively low. Most of the
beggars actually did use the
money for food, they contended.

, But, then, how does either side

really know?

My first-hand experience with
beggars is that most of them col-
lect enough money to go to the

”O” to buy a 40-ounce bottle of

Schlitz Malt Liquor. It's almost a
daily occurrence that I get ap-
proached by a bourbon—breathed
bum asking me if I could possi-
bly spare him a quarter. If these
beggars are the rotten eggs of the
panhandler community, then
why are they all hanging out in
the Oakland area? i

I doubt this is the case. Before
I joined the League of Callous
College Cynics and labeled all
beggars as bums of one sort or
another, I had ‘a similar ex-
perience when visiting Buffalo.

As a wee lad, just before my
freshman year, I went to take a
scholarship test that was being
held in Buffalo. On the way from
the parking garage to,the build-
ing the test was in, I was ap-
proached several times and
solicited for my spare. silver,
which I found myself handing out
in twenty-five and fifty-cent
increments.

At one point I had to stop long
enough to dig for the last rem-
nants of change hiding in the
depths of my pocket and noticed
that the man was standing in front
of a bar. I handed him‘ the
change; he said thanks, turned
around and went into the bar.
Liberals would contend that he
was going in for the fish-and-
chips platter and not the 2,5-cent
drafts of Rolling Rock. But, of
course, beggars like him are the
exception, not the rule, if you
listen to the bleeding hearts long
enough.

Beggars, you see, are good at
what they do. Why people be-
lieve that they are merely unem-

was anyone surprised when all of

as opposed to staying drunk.

 

The whole philosophy of beg-
ging is to look so pitifully near the
edge of death that some poor sop
will actually shell out some
dough. Good health used to be
considered bad news to a beggar.
Beggars with club feet or no eye-
sight were the envy of the pan-
handling community because
they had an unfair advantage of
actually being able to say that
they had no other recourse in life
but to start begging to stay alive.
Thoughtful parents in
medieval world did their child a
favor if they somehow maimed
himso that he would look more

Since that enlightening day in
Buffalo and my acceptance into
the League of Callous College
Cynics, I have refused to distrib-
ute money to people on the

their tale sounds. Some people-

like to say that if we could give
all the beggars jobs there would
be no begging. I like to say that
if we -would stop giving all the
beggars money they would be
forced to stop begging.

felt sure of throughout my life.

It was all very confusing, be-
cause I had learned so many
things that, in a way, I was
more in tune with the world
than I had ever been in my life
before. But, on the other hand,
I had lost touch with myself.
I no longer knew who I was or
what I thought.
. Now, I think it's a good
thing that college life shakes a
person up a bit. Beliefs should
be challenged. Otherwise,
how can we be certain that
we're doing the right thing?

If a person's thoughts are
challenged and he decides-to
change his stance, then he
must have found a legitimate
reason for doing so. Perhaps
he was exposed to facts that he
hadn't previously considered.
Or maybe the situation itself
has changed significantly since
last he regarded it, and so he
has formed a new approach.

On the other hand, if this
person decides that the

Boffemmyer

knowledge he has gained
serves to further convince him
that he had the right idea to
begin with, then his belief has
been reinforced. He can now
feel more certain and assured
that his opinion is the right
one.

Actually, my own opinions
have remained largely intact.
It's just that now I'm more"
concerned about information
to substantiate them, and I'm
open to changing my mind if
I can't find any such infor-
mation.

My advice is not to be fright-
ened of questioning anything.
That's the purpose of the abil-
ity to reason. People change
and grow. If we examine our
development more closely,
perhaps we'll have fewer
regrets about the people we
become.

most difficult to control. It is this
challenge which creates the ap-
peal of arguments.

A good argument is a cross be-
tween chess and a poker game.
In nearly every case, the most ef-
fective weapon is reference per-
taining to the topic under debate.
Like the maneuverability of vari-
ous chess pieces, each bit of out-
side knowledge can bring you
closer to checkmate. Another tac-
tic, however, is to bluff your op-
ponent with an apparent full
house of knowledge, when in ac-
tuality you only have a pair of
ideas.

Some arguments lead you in
with an easy subject but soon
evolve into an area which could
potentially inflict the embarass-

ment of ignorance. If your oppo-
nent raises the stakes and throws
in something over your head, a
good response could be to just
simply pause, tilt your head in
thought, and say, ”Mmmmmm.”

Some of the most thrilling argu-
ments lack logic. If you need an
example, tune in to the nationa-
ly syndicated Morton Downey /r.
Show. Mort is a true craftsman of
instigation. His show isn’t struc-
tured to enlighten an audience
but to entertain them with as
much tasteless arguing as public
television allows. For one hour,
a viewer can vicariously
dominate others through loud,
vulgar screaming while an au-
dience cheers. Is there anything
more powerful than anger?

We can't avoid arguing and its

effect over us. When our adrena-
line flows, it's tempting to in-
dulge in the one aggressive
behavior society permits. Many
of us, however, dread the idea of
being judged by others, and to ar-
gue is to expose this vulnerability.

In its pure form, arguing is in-
tense communication. It's a pity
this function has been corrupted
by our egoes.

Perhaps if we weren't so self-
ish or worried about how other
people see us, arguing wouldn't
be a such a tough game. Maybe
then, getting answers would out-
weigh the thrill of victory.

sufficient to tip the balance in
favor of the Republicans.

Senate Chaplain Richard Hal-
verson says, ’’I have watched
Dan Quayle for seven years in
the Senate, and it is amazing how
he has grown. His presence on
the Senate floor indicates that he
does his homework and that he
does not speak off the top of his
head. I believe he is consistent in
his faith and consistent as a per-
son and would continue to be so,
no matter what.”

Quayle has been described as
a Robert Redford |ook—a|ike.
Democrats have long had a repu-
tation for sexual attractiveness

and/or activeness (Gary Hart,‘

John, Bob and Ted Kennedy, Lyn-
dod Johnson, Franklin Roosevelt
come to mind), but name a
Republican who stirs the juices.
Richard Nixon? Spiro Agnew?
Gerald Ford? Dwight Eisenhow-
er? Thomas Dewey? Calvin
Coolidge? Abe Lincoln? Ronald
Reagan is many things, but I've
never heard him described as

, sexy.

The kind of confidence Dan
Quayle inspires in others is illus-
trated by a 1980 story involving
the lobbyist Paula Parkinson,
who later appeared in Playboy
magazine clad in little more than
her resume. Quayle and two
other members of Congress

shared a Florida vacation house
with Parkinson, but Quayle, who
said he played golfduring the day
and went out to dinner at night,
saidhe left the day Parkinson ar-
rived in town. Marilyn Quayle,
an attorney, who met her hus-
band in law school, gave him the
ultimate compliment when she
said, ’’If Dan was on the_golf
course and saw a naked woman,
he would just ask to play
through.”

Square? Sure he's square, but
isn't it better than some of the re-
cent alternatives?

Craftingthe image of a presidential candidate

George Bush's main p_roblem
in winning the Presidency is clos-
ing the gender gap. All the sur-
veys indicate that women do not
trust Bush, and if this is true, it
could cost him the election.

What to do? A meeting was
held in the New Orleans hotel
suite of the vice president with
his advisers in attendance.

’’I can't understand it," Bush
said. "|'ve always been wonder-
ful to women. I let them precede
me through a revolving door, I
never ordered from the menu be-
fore they do, and I always lit their
cigarettes for them before the sur-
geon general declared it illegal.”

One of the VP's aides
said,"That’s all good gender stuff,
sir, but we believe that the rea-

son women are mad at you is be-
cause of some of the things you
said during your debate with Ger-
aldine Ferraro. Do you remember
that, after it was over, you told the
press how you kicked a little
ass?"

"That was just a joke,” Bush
said. '’I wasn't talking about Mrs.
Ferraro, I was referring to the San-
dinistas in Nicaragua.”

The American women didn't

interpret it that way,” another -
aide said. "That's why we have .

our work cut out for us."
"WeII, what do you want me
to do?" Bush demanded.
Bush's political pollster said,
"Our surveys show that women
think of you as someone they can
push around. They don't believe

you could arm wrestle the Ayatol-
Iah Khomeini and win.”
’'I resent that. Aren't they fami-
Iar with my war record?”
"They know about it, but it's all
canceled out when you use

ART
BUCHWALD

words like doodoo in your
speeches. We have to remake
your image.”

“Could you elaborate on that?”
the vice president asked.

”One of the things our polls tell
us is that women dislike you for
trying to look like something that
you are not. For example, they
say that every time they see you

driving a wheat thresher in Kan-
sas, they want to upchuck. I think
you have to knock off everything,
including mining coal in West
Virginia, for the evening news.”

"Does that mean I can't pre-
tend I'm fishing for tuna off Key
West?”

”You're not fooling anyone, sir.

The only way to close the gender-

gap is to be yourself.”

"How?"

”It won't be easy. But if some-
one said to you, ‘Who are you?’
what would be your reply?”

"I'd say, ‘I am the vice presi-
dent of the United States, but I

didn't know anything about
Noriega in Panama.’ " _
”That's very good, sir. Even if

they don't believe you, it sounds

honest. Now, women don't ex-
pect their presidents to be terrif-
ic lovers, but it doesn't hurt to
have them think you're a great
guy in the bedroom.”

”You can pass the word that
I'm sensational,” Bush said.

"They may not accept that, Mr.
Vice President. When it comes to
the gender gap, everything is per-
ception.” ' I I

"What do you suggest?” Bush
asked.

”Sir, would you try on these
cowboy boots?"

"Boy, could I kick some ..."

"Hold it, Mr. Vice President.

That's what got you into trouble

in the first place.”

Six nifty tipsfor finding love in theclassroom”

Scene: I'm sitting in my/ after-
noon class (a rare occasion, rest
assured) trying not to look bored.
Students continue_to enter the

classroom as the professor)

rechecks his notes. A young lady
enters the room, lithe, tall,
tanned, blonde and possessing a
figure best described as worth
starting a war over.

I have to make her acquain-
tance. Picking my tongue and jaw
up off of the classroom floor and
wiping the dust off of them, I grab
my briefcase and try not to stum-
ble as I maneuver into the desk
beside her. I always had a weak-
ness for blondes, and it was work-
ing overtime. '

’’Is this seat taken?" Always
speak as soon as possible; make
eye contact; and try not to drool
in public.

”By you.” She smiled.

Throughout the next hour, I en-
gaged her in small talk. The
weather, her stock portfolio, the
rising. cost of Mercedes-Benz
maintenance, who does her
teeth, and so on. When in doubt,
don't shut up. Stare into her eyes
like a cat eyeing its lunch. And
keep smiling. ‘

The moment of truth."Care to
split a cheap bottle of wine?”

''I was hoping you'd ask.”
Again, she smiled.

Never fails.

Dating on the Pitt campus is

not difficult, unless you're a
professional circus geek. It's fun,
it's good for your mental health,
self—esteem and emotional stabil-

ity, until you get attached to your

opposite and find out what a bim-
bo she is. She'll like you a lot at
first too, until she discovers that
you're a closet mass-murderer
who collects dolls.

Here are some simple tips from
humble little ol' me.

1.Be aggressive, guys. A meek
man rarely succeeds. In a herd of
deer, it's the buck with the big-
gest horns, the worst odor and the
meanest kick who gets his does.
Enjoy the challenge of the hunt,
and savor the thrill of victory like
an aged bottle of wine.

2.Appearances. Either dress to
kill or look like a redneck. Both
work. L.L. Bean turtlenecks and
matching Douglas Niedermeyer
haircuts are uniform in some
cliques on campus, while others
affect torn flannel shirts and cut-
offs, complimented with straggly
hair, hangovers and a face that
rarely sees a razor. Both work.

3.Suggestions on what to do on
a first date. Since everybody in
thisgcountry is supposed to toe
the 'Just say not yet, comrades’
line to recreational drugs, the
good old days of inviting a wench
up to your fraternity room for a
few joints and some bondage are
over. Or are they?

 

MARK
BROWN

Truthfully, the good old frater-
nity pick—up will not fade away as
long as fraternities remain, but
more outgoing and sober notions
include dinner out, a movie (lots
of places in Oakland to do both),
a walk in Schenley Park or a sim-
ple ice cream cone while watch-
ing derelicts bum spare change.

4.Financial aspects of first
dates.That dinner’ out, fellows,
can range from five bucks for a
pizza plus drinks‘ to over fifty
bucks for a real meal for two,
again, plus drinks. Drinking
nowadays can also mean posting
bail money. Carry a Visa card.

Movies locally run from bar-
gain matinees (two and a half
bucks per person) to the Pitts-
burgh PIayhouse's economical
$2.95 charge, to a. buck" for

screenings at David Lawrence

< Hall, to $4.50 at Showcases for
‘ the current run flicks. Buy a VCR.

One bright lad totalled up the
money that he spent on dates ver-
sus the number of times that an
act of sexual bliss (with at least

one other person involved, that

is) was consummated in a three-

year period, which was a hefty
sum on the former and meager
on the latter. He switched to hir-
Inga professional call girl who at-
tends to his every whim, and he
has several. The amount of
money which he spent went
down and his sex life was, shall
we say, resurrected. I
5.Ceneral tips for success. Look
into her eyes. It's not so much»
hypnotism or even paying atten-
tion to what she's saying, but you
can judge her reaction to you by
the size of her pupils. If they're
big, her blood is flowing and
you're turning her on, or else the
light in the room is bad. When in
doubt, take her- pulse.

Seriously, establish physical
Contact at the first opportunity. It
shows intimacy, it works.

Ask her about herself, and
don't brag about yourself, which
is boring and vain.

,Always carry condoms. The
unofficial but favored Theta Nu
Gamma variety is the type with
the ribs, bumps and the half-inch
open—ended wrench on the tip.

Buy them in bulk, and make sure
to follow the user instructions on
which end is up. '
6.The aftermath.An emotional
involvement_ is a double-edged
sword. It adds spice when you
really care about your new—found
Aphrodite, until you find out that
she's been in the sack with the

better part of two fraternities, ev- »

ery varsity athlete in the Eastern
Conference and is now declared
a toxic waste dump by the
governor. ’ 
Take it from me, find a compat-
ible coed, enjoy yourselves, but

, keep a few more gals on the side.

A couple of neighbors of mine
had this down to an art last year;
it worked for them, so I tried it.
It's fun, and it beats loneliness
and getting an ulcer over one girl
with the attention span of a loaf
of bread who leaves you in the
lurch. Just don't let the members
of your harem know each other,
or they'll gang up on you in their
own conspiracy. “

6.AIl's fair in love, lust, and‘

war, so be prepared for some vi-

cious infighting. Two studs don't

get along, as a general rule.
Jealousy is possibly the most
counterproductive emotion that
I've ever encountered. It ruins
what would otherwise be good
times. Learn to control it, learn to
use it.

Don't Panic: delving into the fears of freshmen

During the blistering heat of the
summer, nearly three thousand
soon to be freshmen anxiously
await -the upcoming fall. These
freshmen flock to Chess King and
other preppie clothing stores and
wear out their parents’ credit
cards. They also swarm to drug
stores and buy all the Clearasil
that Mr. Hooper can stock. At
night, their dreams range from

being popular and having a 4.0 \
average to being naked and

without two sharpened number 2
pencils in class. They are curious,
excited, intrigued, and most of

all; scared to hell.

Nice guy Bob Firth from New
Student Accounts agrees that dur-
ing the first semester freshmen ex-
perience many fears and doubts.

”That is why we have our
orientation program."he says.

Each year Mr. Firth coordinates
a very thorough orientation pro-
gram for new students. "Hopeful-
ly orientation will satisfy some of
their fears."

Being that I started Pitt in the

middle of the term, I didn't have
the opportunity to be orientated.
And with the exception of recur-
ring nightmares of never graduat-
ing from college,
$20,000.00 in student loans, and
making minimum wage for the
rest of my life, I never felt these
great college anxieties that I was
supposed to neither. I must say
that not only do I feel totally left
out, but also I feel that freshmen
may be overreacting just a little.

Because basically, what is there
to be afraid of? The University of
Pittsburgh only has about 30,000
students total each cutting
another’s throat to get the best
possible grade. Just because
someone sitting next to you in
class would push your grand-
mother down four flights of steps
in order to divert your attention
for a few days thus swinging the
grade curve their way shouldn't
bother you especially if you're an
American and/or planning on be-
ing a lawyer.

Since that's not it, maybe new

having.

students are afraid for their safe-
ty. Freshmen shouldn't be wor-
ried about their safety because
there are plenty of doughnut
shops on Pitt campus which thus
means plenty of police officers
waddling around.

MARK
STAF

Since that's not it, maybe new
students are afraid that once they
leave home they will starve or be
malnurished. Again, freshmen
should have no fear due to the
fact that The Original Hot Dog
Shop is open 24 hours a day, the
people that work there are so
friendly, and the cuisine is exqui-
site. I personally would like to
recommend either the Vaseline
hoagie or the deep fried Crisco,
two excellent entrees. _

Since it's not competition, safe-
ty, or malnutrition that our in-
coming freshmen are worried
about, then what may it be? I

know. Maybe new students are
intimitated by the size of Pitt cam-
pus. Well, that's no problem
either. Even though Pitt campus
is the size of a small city, there
are maps of Pitt campus available
all around campus and at gas sta-
tions everywhere. Before it is pos-
sible to use this map however,
one must take a ‘class in map
reading located somewhere on
campus. I'm not sure where this
class meets. I could never find it.

I have noticed that when look-
ing for a building or class, if you
ask ten people, you are almost
sure to find someone who thinks
they might know where it is.

Since the campus is no longer
a threat, what else could new stu-
dents be worried about? I know,
freshmen are worried about the
night life scene. There are plenty
of night clubs and bars located on
Pitt campus. For those of you
freshmen that are not 21 years
old yet, you are going to need a
good, all American fake |.D. or
you will not be getting into nine-
ty percent of said bars.

I must admit, I am totally out of
ideas about what the fears of
freshmen are. Also, I think that
Pitt is spending too much time

and money in their efforts to‘

orientate new students. A true
orientation should be coordinat-
ed by seniors and should be a lit-
tle different. Instead of showing
movies, playing games, and hav-
ing mentors take students around
campus, showing them where
everything is and answering their
questions, mentors should take
new students and lock them into
a room, make them drink five
pots of coffee, force them to stay
awake for three days straight
memorizing books of useless in-
formation, then fill them full of
booze, feed them Original fries
with cheese until they barf, force
them to eat three meals a day on
two dollars, then make them call
their parents and beg for even
more money at the same time ex-
plaining to them why they are
failing every single one of their
classes.

battling for that position, with
Dickerson seemingly taking more
snaps at training camp in
Johnstown.

Rather, the questions will be,
”Can we have a winning season
and return to a bowl game with
only one dozen seniors to pro-

their lack of playing experience?”
”Can we win without the multi-

his '88 Panthers. He wants to
avoid injuries, have a winning
season and end with another
bowl game.

Despite the quarterback con-
troversy, the offense is sound this
season, thanks largely to the
offensive line. Gottfried called it
”one of the best offensive line
groups that we've ever had,”
despite the loss of two of last
year's linemen, centers Ed Miller
and Chip Backauskas.

All-Everything candidate Mark

prove to be one of, if not the,

The tailback slot will see quite
a change from last season. Rather
than the overpowering presence
of ”lronhead” Heyward, fans will
see the quicker moves of junior
Adam Walker. Walker was se-
cond on the team in rushing yard-
age with 214 yards on 38 carries,
a 5.6 yard average and one
touchdown.

Spelling Walker will be
second-year freshman Ronald
Redmon and freshman Curvin
Richards, who rushed for 1,159
yards and 14 touchdowns as a
senior in high school.

Sophomore Jeff Christy, a con-
verted linebacker, saw most of

the starting time at training camp
as the starting fullback, although
junior Dan Crossman is listed first
on the depth chart. Freshmen
Derrick Lewis and David Moore

also are listed at the blocking \‘

Quarterback seems to still be
a wide-open job. Dickerson start-
ed four games last year, passing
for 375 yards and one touch-
down, and also added another
dimension to the offense; the op-
tion play.

Dickerson underwent off-
season knee surgery, but Gott-
fried said his knee is fine now.
Gottfried also said Dickerson
should be academically eligible.

Wanke filled in adequately
when Dickerson was injured in
the Bluebonnet Bowl, passing for
172 yards and three touchdowns
in the second half alone. Wanke
completed 13 of 27 passes for
230 yards for the year.

Freshman Alex Van Pelt from
San Antonio, Texas, fills out the
top three QB positions.

Senior Vernon Kirk assumes
the starting tight end role this sea-
son, complemented by David
Tanczos and Tom Huebner.

The wide receiver position
seems to be at least as sound as
the offensive line. Henry Tuten
and Reggie Williams return at
split end, while flankers Billy Os-
born and Hosea Heard return.
Add in track star Lee McRae, and
you have a dangerous mixture.

Williams led all receivers with
535 yards receiving and a 17.3
yards per reception average, as
well as three touchdowns. Os-
born was second with 341 yards
receiving.

Darrin Gillaspie will see time
as the third—string flanker, and
freshman sensation Baron Jack-
son will fill in at split end.

The kickers will remain the
same. Junior Jeff VanHorne , at-
tempting to come back from an
off year, might be challenged by
freshman Scott Kaplan. Punter is
the only question mark in the
special teams unit. Two-year
starter John Rasp quit the team
Aug. 18, leaving the position
open.

Either VanHorne or tailback
Erik Matheison will assume the
starting duties. Jeff Christy was
also in contention, but knee sur-
gery will keep him from playing
for an undetermined amount of
time.

Defensively, the line will again
be a force to reckon with. Last
year's ECAC Rookie-of-the-Year
Marc Spindler leads the hit pa-
rade at right tackle, and senior
right end Burt Grossman also

Position changes bolster weak spots of team

By Vince Carey

The Pitt News

For a few Pitt football players,
the coming season will be a little
different from the last as a result
of off—season position changes.

Junior Dean Caliguire will
move from guard to center,
sophomore Louis Riddick will go
from fullback to strong safety,
sophomore Eric Seaman from
tight end to defensive end and
sophomore Prentiss Wright will
switch from fullback to outside
linebacker.

Caliguire was an All-East guard

last season, but has a small han-
dle on the center spot, having
played there as a freshman in
1986.

”| feel pretty good [at center],"
Caliguire said. ”The snaps are
starting to come along. I have a
long way to go before I can be-
come good, but I feel a lot more
comfortable now than I did
earlier.”

Caliguire was named a presea-
son second team All-American by
the College and Pro Football
Newsweekly.

’’I think playing center will
help me out in the long run,”

Caliguire said. ”I played guard
last year, and I did, I guess, pret-
ty decently.

’’If I could play center well and
help the team out there, it will
help me out. By being able to
play twopositions. Being able to
snap the ball is a big thing.”

With young quarterbacks, the
change could be difficult, but
Caliguire doesn't forsee many
problems.

”Getting the quarterback-
center exchange is really all I
have to do with the quarterback,”
Caliguire said. ”They do their as-
signment. I do my assignment. So
the only thing I really have to do
is snap the ball to them.”

With all of this going on,
Caliguire is very optimistic about
the upcoming season.

’’It’s hard to predict what our
record will be, but I can say the
style we're going to play is going
to be very exciting. It'll be en-
thusiastic.

"On defense, I think there are
going to be a lot of people get-
ting to the ball. On offense, we're
doing a lot of different things. I
think it is going to be fun to watch

our football team this season.
Regardless of the outcome, we're
going to be out there to play ev-
ery game."

Last season Riddick was ’that
other running back.’ Playing be-
hind Craig Heyward, Riddick
gained 175 yards in 40 attempts.
This season he has moved to the
other side of the ball.

’’It is not really a big change for
me," Riddick said. ”I went all
through camp last year as a free
safety. I remembered all the
defenses, and it's been pretty
good so far.”

Riddick was recruited as a safe-
ty, but he was moved to fullback
out of necessity last season.
Although he looked good as a
running back, Riddick would
rather play defense.

”Defense has always been the
best for me. Plus the reputation
that you get for playing defense
here is very good. You are
respected across the country. Like
the coaches tell us, ’It’s an honor
to play here on defense.’ ”

Defensive coordinator and
secondary coach John Fox has
liked what he has seen in Riddick

so far.

”Lou has had some work on
defense before, so he should be
prepared," Fox said. ”He works
very hard and should be ready
when the season starts.”

Riddick has not set many per-
sonal goals for the coming sea-
son, but he knows what he wants
from the team.

”We have worked hard, and
it's time that we collect on our
hard work,” Riddick said. ”Our
immediate goal is to win all 11
games.”

Seaman was valuable to the
team last season as a freshman
tight end. He had 40 yards on 4
receptions while starting six
games in a run-oriented offense.

Wright gained 55 yards in 13
rushes at fullback last season. He
is not totally unfamiliar with the
linebacker position, having
played there in high school. He
is expected to be the starting line-
backer come game time.

Although changes are inevita-
ble in any sport, these Pitt play-
ers are ready for the challenge.

Dickerson, Wanke out for NO. 1 QB spot

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

A new football season always
brings with it new challenges for
the Pitt football team. This year,
the squad must battle youth and
relative inexperience if they wish
to have a winning season and
return to a bowl game.

But one thing remains the
same: the quarterback con-
troversy.

Last year, it was the Joe
Felitsky-Sal Genilla question, un-
til Felitsky announced he would
not play. Pitt head coach Mike
Gottfried then opted to start fresh-
man Darnell Dickerson for the fi-
nal four games of the season. And
freshman Larry Wanke also saw
time during the regular season, as
well as in the Bluebonnet Bowl.

This season, Dickerson and
Wanke are in heated contention
for the NO. 1 quarterback slot,
each carrying their own differen-
tiating credentials.

Based On talent and ex-
perience, Dickerson is the clear-
cut favorite. He started his first
game at Rutgers last Nov. 7, win-
ning the first Of three consecutive
games for the Panthers.

Dickerson finished the season
with 35 completions in 93 at-
tempts (37.6 percent) for 375
yards and one touchdown. He
was also intercepted three times.

Although his stats may not
reflect it, Dickerson adds a differ-
ent dimension to the Pitt offense
— the option play. The 6-foot-4,
200-pound quarterback’s scram-
bling ability is probably his
greatest asset, although he does
possess a remarkably accurate
arm.

’’I feel most comfortable rolling
out, because I'm used to reacting

 

in that fashion," said Dickerson.

Dickerson gained 78 yards on
45 rushing attempts last season,
including a long run of 13 yards
and one scoring run.

Dickerson suffered a knee inju-
ry early in the third quarter of the
Bluebonnet Bowl, forcing surgery
which caused him to miss all Of
spring practice this year and
seemingly giving Wanke an edge
on the starting spot.

”Without Darnell in spring
practice, we put some things on
the back burner," said Gottfried.
”He does things differently than
Larry.”

But things have changed. Dick-
erson is healthy and was taking
snaps at training camp in
Johnstown.

”Knee-wise, he's in good
shape,” said Gottfried. And
despite rumors of academic in-

eligibility, Gottfried said, ”aca-
demically he's in good shape.”

Wanke’s status was never in
question. The 6-2, 195-pound
sophomore saw action in three
games last year, compiling 230
yards passing on 13 completions.

Wanke’s best game was against
Texas in the Bluebonnet Bowl,
when he replaced Dickerson and
passed for 172 yards and three
touchdowns in less than two

quarters.

The pressure may also have
gotten to Wanke in that game, as
he threw all three of his season
interceptions against the Lon-
ghorns.

Wanke, a pure dropback quar-
terback, gained the starting nod
when Dickerson missed spring
practice. But Dickerson is back in
the running, with both quarter-

Pantheriopponents to dish out
tough competition this season

By Vince Carey
The Pitt News

Pitt has another difficult foot-
ball schedule on hand this
season.

’’I don't really think you can
look past any of our opponents,"
Defensive Coordinator John Fox
said. ”There are always those big
games — Penn State, West Vir-
ginia, Notre Dame —— that people
seem to focus on, but, I think, all
of the games are going to be
tough.”

Pitt starts off the season Sept. 3
with the relatively-unknown
Northern Iowa Panthers,
coached by former Ohio State
mentor Earl Bruce.

Although Northern Iowa is a di-
vision l-AA school, they may pro-
vide a better game than Kent State

did last season. They return 15.

starting players, including All-
American candidate . Wes ‘An-
derson.
Anderson is regarded as one of
\ the better wide receivers in the

country. Last season, he had 71
receptions for 791 yards. He
could test Pitt's young defensive
backfield.

After an off week, Ohio State
visits Pitt Stadium for the first time
since 1951.

Last season, the Buckeyes
suffered through a disappointing
6-4-1 season, which led to the
dismissal of Bruce as coach.

Chris Spielman led the Ohio
State defense las“t- season, but he
is in the pro ranks. The leaders
now are senior noseguard Mike
Sullivan — second on the team in
tackles with 78 — and senior out-
side linebacker Mike McCray —
fifth with 71 tackles. .

Senior tailback Vince Work-
man had a tough year last season,
gaining only 495 yards, but he
should be back to his '86 form
when he gained 1079 yards.

The very next week, arch-rivals
West Virginia come to town.

Although they finished a medi-
ocre 6-6 last season, they were a

« respected team. Five of their six
losses were by six points or less.
With one more year of ex-
perience, they should be able to
turn it around.

Sophomore Major Harris threw
for 1200 yards and 10 touch-
downs on his way to being
named freshman quarterback of
the year by The Sporting News.
Harris also set WVU freshman
records for rushing (615 yards),

passing and total offense.

The Panther defense was able
to hold Harris down last time, but
a season later might be a little
different.

On Oct. 1, Pitt travels to
Boston College, in what could
very much be a big game.

The Eagles return six starters on
each side of the ball from last sea-
son's 5-6 team.

In BC’s case, their record
doesn't speak for the way they
have played. They lost close
games to USC (23-17), Penn State
(27-17) and Notre Dame (32-25).

Quarterback Mike Power
returns, as does running back Jim
Bell, to lead the Eagle's some-
times explosive offense.

They have beaten Pitt for two
straight years, so this will un-
doubtedly be another tough
contest.

Notre Dame visits Pitt on Oct.
8 in what could be a revenge
game.

Last season, the Fighting Irish
were undefeated (3-0) until the
Panthers surprised them with a
30-22 win.

Coach Lou Holtz lost Heisman
Trophy winner Tim Brown, but
actually may have a better team
on his hands.

Sophomore Tony Rice has the

running-throwing combination

that is becoming prevalent to to-
day's major QBs. He almost.
single-handedly brought the Irish
back from the dead in last sea-
son's Pitt game, replacing injured
starter Terry‘ Andrysiak. .

Now Rice is the No. 1 QB, so
he will be able to do what he
does best : control the offense.

Once again Temple will bring
their brand of football to
Pittsburgh.

Their brand of football is us-
sually losing, that is, until they
play Pitt. For some reason, the
Owls have beaten the Panthers in
three of the last four games.

This season, they return run-
ning back Todd McNair, who ran
for 1,058 yards last season.
Against Pitt, McNair ran for 213
yards on 41 tries.

No matter how bad a team
Temple seems to have on paper,
they always seem to ‘give Pitt
trouble. This time should be no
different.

Navy arrives on Oct. 22.

This team has been in trouble
for a number of years. The Mid-
dies finished a dismal 2-9 last sea-
son and there shouldn't be much

of a change this season.

Linebacker Mark Pimpo is their
best known returning player and
led the team with 139 tackles last
season.

But for how bad the Middies

were last season, Pitt could only
manage a 10-6 win.
. Navy plays Pitt, Notre Dame
and Syracuse all in a row this sea-
son, so the road could be long
and frustrating for the Mid-
shipmen.

Nov. 5 ushers in New Jersey's
own Rutgers team.

The Scarlet Knights return quar-
terback Scott Erney (1,369 yards
on 122 completions), who had a
decent game in a 17-0 Pitt win
last season. .

An interesting aspect to this
game is that Rutgers has scored
a total of two touchdowns in five
meetings against Pitt.

This game is also Pitt's last

home game of the season, fol- «

lowed by three road games.

For those of you who enjoy
road trips, Pitt will visit Penn
State on Nov. 12.

_ Heisman trophy candidate
Blair Thomas had off-season knee
surgery, and it is not yet known

if he will play in 1988.

The Nittany Lions have much
the same problem as Pitt — a
quarterback controversy. Coach
Joe Paterno has yet to
announce whether Tom Bill or
1 Lance Lonergan will start the sea-
son behind center.

North Carolina State was shut-
out by Pitt last season, but the sto-

ry could very well be different ‘-7

this time around.

Quarterback Shane Mont-
gomery (1,144 yards, 81 comple-
tions) is highly regarded in
collegiate football and may cause
some problems for the Pitt
defense.

Syracuse will be a much differ-
ent team this time around without
quarterback Don McPherson.

The option will remain, but
they may not have anybody as
skilled to run it as McPherson.

On defense, Markus Paul (62
tackles, second on the team)
returns and should be ready for
any receiver that comes his way.

The Orangemen will be a
strong team, but not as dominat-
ing as last season's 11-0-1 team.

1 0 The Pitt football team opens
the season against the Northern
Iowa Panthers, the only team
with the same nickname that
Pittsburgh has ever faced.

Northern lowabrings with it a
new head coach in Earl Bruce.
Bruce, if you’ll remember, was
the Ohio State coach up until last
year, when he was abruptly fired.

0 Former Pitt basketball star
Charles Smith is ‘still with the U.S.
Olympic squad. The 6-foot-10
center, who was the third player
taken in this year’s NBA draft, is
one of fourteen players remaining
on the team. Coach John Thomp-
son must cut his roster,to 12
members by September 2.

0 Panther defensive tackle
Scott Hart has decided to leave

» the Pitt football team and the

university. Hart, 6-6, 245 pounds,
would have been a sophomore
but opted to join the service.

0 Pitt's top returning rusher,
first—string tailback Adam Walker,
gained 214 yards last year. Craig
Heyward ran for 1,791 yards. A
measly difference of 1,577 yards.

0 John Harper, a . 6-1, 185-
pound running back from
McKeesport High School, was
the only Proposition 48 casualty
among this year’s incoming fresh-
men. The past three years have
seen Pitt's Prop 48 freshman
reduced from six to four to one.

0 Former Pitt assistant basket-
ball coach John Calipari was
hired as the head basketball
coach at the University of Mas-
sachusetts over the summer.
Calipari, who was involved with
recruiting and on—floor coaching,
was replaced by John Sarandrea,
head coach of Tolentine High
School in New York City. The
Panthers hope to take advantage
of his ties in The Big Apple to im-
prove their recruiting.

Stars lost for only the first time

this summer when the IFC All-
Stars won a night game at Pitt
Stadium, 15-4. Previously, The
Pitt Newsers defeated WPTS 14-2
and 11-4 in a doubleheader.
News Editor Scot Ross led the
Pitt Newsers with a two-run, two-
out single, and Alan Rugh belted
an in-the-park home run.
Although we may not have
shown our competence on the di-

1 amond against the IFC, we here-

by challenge the same team to a
football game to be played on a
Sunday afternoon of their choice
(but not in Pitt Stadium — carpet
burns are no fun).

with Pacific University. Northern

to see Columbiain 1992.

0 After a stellar senior season in
which he recorded a school
record 24% sacks, Zeke Gadson
was cut by the Buffalo Bills. Gad-
son, a linebacker who had been
practicing at free safety, was

picked up by the Houston Oilers. 

Coincidentally, free safety
Quintin Jones, a second-round

draft pick of the Oilers, had all

contract negotiations thrown off
the table when he asked for

$150,000 more than last year’s
A second-round pick. 1

0 Starting ‘ New Orleans tail-
back.Rueben Mayes, a two-time
Pro-Bowl selection, left the Saints
training camp in mid-August. He
wasupset about the amount. of
money his base salary would pay
him this year, $175,000, and has
since asked to be traded rather
than play under his current con-
tract. Craig Heyward, Pitt's All-
American running back last sea-
son, has a base salary of
$204,000 as a rookie, and is the
second highest-paid back on the
team.

0 Jerome Lane, who left school
atyear early to enter the NBA
draft, may end up playing in Ita-
ly. The Denver Nuggets, who
drafted Lane as the 23rd pick on
the first round, had only $550 left
under their salary cap, and were
thus forced to offer Lane the mini-
mum rookie salary ‘of $1 50,000.

0 Speaking of Lane, no one will
miss him after Proposition 48
casualty Brian Shorter dons a Pitt
uniform.

0 The loss of John Rasp hurts
the Pitt football team more than
some people might realize. Rasp,
a junior, had the position sewn
up for the third straight year, but
now Mike Gottfried has one
more question to answer on an
already inexperienced team.

0 Brian Bosworth’s book, ”The
Boz,”’ proves once again that he
is a disgrace to the game of pro

’ footbal I .

0 Bubby Brister is not the an-
swer to the Steelers’ quarterback
woes.

0 Both the Associated Press
and United Press International
college football polls have Pitt
ranked approximately 29th. Flori-
da State holds the top spot in both
polls, and Penn State 20th in the
AP rankings, 15th in the UPI poll.
AP ranks West Virginia 16th.

Panther running backs unproven
but talented at start of season

By Sam Tallarico
Assistant Sports Editor

With the loss of Craig Heyward
to the NFL’s New Orleans Saints,
the Pitt Panthers find themselves
a little thin in experience when
it comes to the offensive
backfield. .

After all, Heyward rushed for
1,791 yards, 1,577 yards more
than runner-up Adam Walker.

Walker, a 6-foot-3, 193-pound

junior, carried only 38 times last

season but averaged 5.6 yards per
carry. . ‘

Heading into training camp, he
is listed as the No.1 tailback on
the depth chart.

Heyward’s departure has
caused Pitt head coach, Mike
Gottfried to make some changes
in the scheme of things.

”Offensive|y, we'll be chang-
ing structurally. Adam’ will be the

starter at camp, but Ronald Red-
mon [5—11, 205-pound redshirt
freshman from Miami] had a
good spring practice.

”Tommie Liggins’ [running
backs coach] objective is to have
a lot of tailbacks. Adam's inex-
perienced  but when he went
into the games‘, he did very well
for us," added Gottfried.

”There are three things you can
say about the running backs:
they're young, they're inex-
perienced and it’s« going to be ex-
citing,” said Liggins. "You would
think, in most cases, that it would
hurt you, but it will make it easi-
er to fight for it. ,

”|t’s big for them to be the run-
ning back for the University of
Pittsburgh,” Liggins added.

As for Walker, the loss ‘of Bri-
an Davis to academic woes for
the second time shouldn't affect
his performance either way, but

it just may have helped Walker
secure the job.
"It doesn't make much differ-

' ence to me. If he was here, he'd

push for the job.”

’’I don't think the. loss takes
away any competitiveness,” said
Liggins. "Brian was here, but he
was never really here. You can't
miss what you never had.”

Aside from Walker and Red-
mon, freshman Curvin Richards
— 5-10, 190 pounds, from
LaPorte TX — may see some play-
ing time. Richards rushed for
1,059 yards and 14 touchdowns
as a senior.

Richards’ talents will definite-
ly bring out the best in Walker.
’’I heard he's a good athlete, but
I love competition and ‘I'm ready

to play. I want to stay on and car- ‘

ry the Pitt tradition,” said Walker.

Stepnoski looking for

more than awards and 

honors during season

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

Mark Stepnoski is not the type
of person you would call shy.
Nor would you call him bold.

Confident. Optimistic. That's
what you would call him.

The 6-foot-3, 265—pound senior
offensive guard has set high goals
for himself and his Panther team-
mates this season,'a|l leading to
one goal: ”The bowl game,” in
Stepnoski’s own words.

It seems appropriate that Step-
noski should be one of the first
besides Panther head coach Mike
Gottfried to speak of getting back
to a bowl game. He can back his
words with his achievements:
preseason All-American candi-
date by College and Pro Football
Newsweekly, The NFL Draft
Report, The Sporting News, and
Football Digest.

The NFL Draft Report rated him
highest in the country among all
collegiate offensive players and
second highest overall.

Stepnoski is also regarded as
the fifth best Outland Trophy can-
didate and the ninth best Lom-
bardi Trophy candidate in the
nation by The Sporting News,
and the second-best offensive
guard in the country by the same
publication.

But the recognition means
nothing to Stepnoski if he can't

back the acclaim with his play on
the field.

”...’[I have] to try to play as
good as I possibly can, just to try
to never get beat in a game, never
give up any sacks, don't let my
man make any tackles  just play
every game, so that at the end of
the year, I can take any one of my
12 (including the bowl game)
games,‘and just say, ’watch this.’
So if somebody was to come in
and grade me, I could show them
any one of the I2. That's what I'd
like to be able to do,” Stepnoski
said confidently.

Last year was supposed to be
the season that Stepnoski became
one of the most dominant line-
men in the country, but an ankle
injury suffered in the season
opener against Brigham Young
hindered Stepnoski’s progress.
He was sidelined against West
Virginia and missed more playing
time than he normally would
have during the rest of the sea-

son. To his credit, Stepnoski was

still named second-team All-East
and first-team ECAC.

But this season should be
different, Stepnoski said. The in-
jury bug is gone. ”I don't see any
problems. I feel really good. I felt
good in the spring. I lifted and ran
a lot all year, so I feel really
good/’

Experienced receiving corps an
asset to young Panther offense

By Vince Carey
The Pitt News’

Last season, the Pitt offense re-
lied heavily on the running game
and almost exclusively on Craig
Heyward. Now, Heyward is
found in the backfield down in
the cajun country, and the Pan-
ther offense will seemingly have
to change its style.

The expected change is to a
more wide—open option offense,
not unlike the type Syracuse used
so successfully last season.

The option requires there be a
mobile quarterback and receivers
who can act as offensive linemen
to give the play enough time to
work.

This will put more pressure on
the Panther receiving corps.

”The option is going to add
another exciting dimension to
our offense,” senior flanker Billy
Osborn said. ”We don't want to
be regulated to a certain type of
offense.

’’It puts a little more strain on
us as receivers. We have to go
down the field and block and
know some more assignments.
But if it's going to help us win,

we're more than happy to do it.”

Pitt's receivers averaged 13.2
yards a game in the running

' offense. In an option offense, they

will be called upon to do much
more.

”To me it is just another play,”
flanker Hosea Heard said.

”We’re just out there playing, it
doesn't really bother us. As long
as we do our jobs, things will run
smoothly.”

’’I really can't say too much
about the option,” said junior
split end Reggie Williams. ’’It’s
something that the coaches will
like to run, so, like it or not, we
have to run it.

”—

All our receivers know
the routes and they
know where they have
to be. It will help out
whoever is the q_uar-
terback.

— Larry Wanke
—
I I

’’I think it’s,a good offense. It
depends on who’s open, whether
it's the receiver or the running
back, so if everything goes right
it should be exciting.”

Williams led all Pitt receivers
last season with 31 receptions for
535 yards. Osborn was second at
26 for 341.

With Williams, Osborn, Heard
and junior Henry Tuten, the Pan-
thers have seasoned receivers
who have been through the mill,
which should help, no matter
who starts at quarterback — Dar-

nell Dickerson or Larry Wanke.

”Anytime you have an ex-
perienced receiver, things flow
better,” quarterback Larry Wanke
said. ”All our receivers know the
routes and they know where they
have to be. It will help out,
whoever the quarterback is.”

”We have an advantage be-
cause we have been together,”
said Osborn. ’’I consider us a
veteran group, an experienced
group.

’’I think if you look at the
receivers, what impresses me
anyway, and I'm sure the
coaches, is the work ethic. Every
guy in our group really works
hard. That is something that is im-
portant coming into camp, and I
think it is something we are fol-
lowing through with so far.”

As the older members of the
group, Osborn and Williams will
undoubtedly be leaders on and
off the field.

’’If you go out there and prac-
tice lazy and don't know what
you want to do, the other guys
tend to follow you,” Williams
said. ’’It depends on how your
leadership is.

”On the other hand, if you go
out there and get things done and
do what the coaches ask and the
other guys follow you, it works
out. It helps the team out a Iot.”

Osborn is used to the leader-
ship role, having assumed it on
the field the last two years with

his enthusiastic play.

”Knowing this is my last year,
I've taken more of the leadership
role,” Osborn said. ’’I don't want
to get too caught up in that. I'll
do what needs to be done.

”I’m a vocal guy anyway. I've

always had a lot of enthusiasm,

that's just the way I play football.
If I can be a help to the younger
guys, then I'll do that.

”I enjoy talking to everybody.
I know what the younger guys
feel like, because I've been there.
If anybody has any questions, I'll
try my best to answer. If the
coaches are busy or looking the
other way, I'll be more than will-
ing to answer their questions,”

Spindler has nothing to
prove after stellar first
season in Pitt uniform

To explain the difference a year
makes in the life of a player of
Marc Spind|er’s caliber, one need
look no further than Spind|er’s
first exposure to the bright lights
of a major metropolitan media
barrage, Pitt Photo Day 1987. Of
course, growing up in West
Scranton, Pa., it's understandable
a freshman could get lost in all
the excitement of the moment.

To see Spindler, shy and almost
fearful of the flashing cameras,
belies the confidence which he
displayed during his freshman
yeah

,’’I think I adjusted well to the
pressures of a major college foot-
ball program,” Spindler said.

Imagine, for a moment, a
17-year old defensive lineman
entering his first collegiate foot-
ball contest, only to find out that
by the end of the first quarter he

is the subject of constant double- 1

teaming by the opposition’s
offensive line. .

l/—

I think I adjusted well
to the pressues of a
major college football
program.

— Marc Spindler

Talk about instant respect.

Perhaps not since the days of
Hugh Green has a player stepped
onto the Pitt campus with such
remarkably high accolades.
Among his many high school
achievements, Spindler was
named the USA Today High
School Defensive Player of the
Year.

’’I think that I put more pressure
on myself than did anybody
else,” said Spindler, a 6—foot—5,
270—pound defensive tackle.

Spindler made his impact on
the defensive unit and opposing
offenses throughout the entire
season, finishing behind only
Zeke Gadson in total tackles.
Spindler was often seen in the op-
postion’s backfield, as evidenced
by his 13 quarterback hurries and
one sack. I

With such impressive totals,
how does Spindler plan to im-
prove on his totals from his inau-
gural campaign?

”Well, as with all levels of foot-
ball, the idea is to make steady
improvement game by game,” he
said.

Spindler quickly disdained the
notion of setting any statistical
goals for himself.

”The fact that we ended the
season on a loss [Bluebonnet
Bowl] provides the team with
plenty of incentive to improve
upon last year's effort.”

But there is more to Spindler
than just his physical presence on
the field.

’’I can honestly say I've never
seen a freshman in all my years
of coaching who displayed so
much talent in such a short span
of time,” Pitt coach Mike Gott-
fried said. ”He’s someone who
operates on his own talent and
desire to constantly improve
himself.”

Of course, Spindler is quick to

nice to hear, but in the end we

dismiss the kudos as immaterial
to his playing style.
”Sure, the compliments are

win and lose together,” said
Spindler.

As one of only four players in
the last two decades to start the“,
first game of his freshman year
(the others being Green, Bill Fra|—
ic and Tony Dorsett), it would
seem Spindler would find little
use for hero worship. Yet, Spin-
dler does have a role model.

”Howie Long. Ever since I start-
ed watching him,” Spindler
said/’|’m fascinated by the way
he roams along the defensive
line. It's as if he's a moving tar-
get, unable to be contained in
one specific location.” .

Fortunately for’ Panther fans,
Spindler will be anchored in his
defensive tackle position for the
next three years.

ers is counting on Stepnoski to
bolster the line, already consi-
dered the strongest point of the
'88 squad. ”Aside from his phys-
ical abilities as a football player,
and his strengths on the football
field, we're going to need his
leadership ability.

”We don't have many seniors
on the team, and Mark has been
our three—year starter, and he un-
derstands what it takes to win 
I think our players look to him for
stability, leadership and just solid
p|ay,” Meyers added.

And Stepnoski is aware of what
his teammates expect of him.

”Anyti me you play a lot, you're
asked to be a leader. They want-
ed me to do it last year a little bit
too, so I tried to do it last year,
just because I'd been playing for
a while.”

But it wasn't that long ago that
Stepnoski wondered whether or
not he would ever.p|ay at Pitt

again. When Gottfried came to
Pitt in time for the 1986 season,
then offensive line coach Joe
Moore, generally regarded as one
of the best in the nation and the
primary reason Stepnoski came to
Pitt, was relieved of his duties.

Rumors that Stepnoski would
transfer to any number of other
schools abounded.

But Stepnoski stayed, and he
has no regrets. ’’I couldn't be in
any better positionthan where I
am now, there's just no way.

”At the time, I was 18 [or] 19
years old, and I didn't know what
was going on. All of a sudden
these people come in; you don't
even know them. You've been
here for a year; you just got out
of high school; you don't know
what's going on. You don't know
what to do, you get all confuse ,"
Stepnoski said.

”But I stayed here and I
couldn't possibly complain about

staying here. Everything’s turned
out great.”

Yet things should only get bet-
ter for Stepnoski as he ap-
proaches his final year in a Pitt
uniform. The All-American status
he has earned during his career
at Pitt has him earmarked as a
top—round draft pick next spring.
But Stepnoski knows that the
recognition itself will not earn
him a roster spot on an NFL team.

”The draft is really the only
barometer that matters at all. All-
American teams and stuff like
that, that's how the general pub-
lic might gauge you, but What
really matters is game filmsland
the [NFL] combines, stuffjllike
that, where they can actually see
what you can do instead of /lead-
ing about you in the paper,”/' Step-
noski said. _ /'

I ’’I don't mind publicity, but it's
not the most important thing 
you can't really dwell on it,” he
added.

Most of the publicity centers
around the tradition of fine offen-
sive linemen Pitt produces and
the fact that Stepnoski could ac-
tually turn out to be the best of
that group.

That ”group” includes Mark
May, Russ Grimm, limbo Covert
and Bill Fralic, among others.

’ But Stepnoski has more in
mind than just the inevitable
comparisons. I

”People  they're going to say
whatever they want to say. But I'd
just like for the people that played
here and coached here just to
know that I was a good guy, that
I never really gave anybody a
hard time, that I worked hard 
and did well in school,” said
Stepnoski, a communications
major.

’’I earned my scholarship. I .

never really cheated anybody out
of anything. I just did what was
expected of me.”

And those were high expec-
tations.

Figuring most prominently in
this category is Assistant Head

Former Pitt backfield mates Sal Genilla and Craig Heyward may be reunited in New Orleans.

Pittsburgh at a loss for big name

Where have all the marquee
names gone?

Pitt has always had a national-
ly known athlete. This year is a
little different.

Gone are Charles Smith, Jer-
ome Lane, Craig Heyward and

Zeke Gadson. Before that was

Dan Marino, Bill Fralic, Matt
Cavanaugh and Roger Kingdom.
The new crop of Pitt athletes is
led by Darnell Dickerson, Lee
McRae and Bobby Martin: not ex-
actly household names (with the
exception of McRae), especially
outside of the Pittsburgh area.

Not to take anything away from
them — they are all good players
— just not big names. They could
make themselves into name play-
ers, but at the start of the new
school year they are just behind-
the-scenes players.

Pitt is now dominated by
coaches like Paul Evans and Mike
Gottfried, coaches that are out-
spoken and lead their teams in
that way.

Before Evans, nobody really
knew who Dr. Roy Chipman
was. Pitt basketball suffered with
a no-name coach.

Now, Evans keeps Pitt in the

spotlight with his outgoing na-
ture, and he can bring the better
players in.

Foge Fazio was the head foot-
ball coach, and he followed Jack-
ie Sherrill. That made Fazio a big

vmce
CAREY

name. But as the team faltered, he
was quickly forgotten.
Gottfried, on the otherihand,
has been outspoken about a
number of things. Last season, he
made big news by attacking
sports agents. In addition, he has
already taken a major stand on
academics as part of the college
athlete's training. It helps the
school and the football program.
Pushed aside are the big—name
Pitt athletes. Now you have the
problem Pitt athlete.
Everybody in the country
knows what Heyward did. Here
was a guy who had everything in
front of him — he could go pro
and test unchartered waters or re-

main as a Pitt player and be the
No. 1 Heisman Trophy candidate
coming into the season.

He, of course, shot into the pro
ranks and is challenging for the

No. 1 running back position out ,

of the New Orleans Saints’ camp.

Smith was last season's Big East
player of the year. He spent his
four years at Pitt in a Panther
basketball uniform and left as
perhaps the Panthers’ best ever.
He stayed his four years and
made a name for himself and Pitt
basketball.

Lane, on the other hand, decid-
ed to go into the National Basket-
ball Association after his junior
season. . ’

It is hard to condemn a young
man who feels he can make a liv-
ing by turning pro early, but one
more year of college ball might
have guaranteed Lane a bigger
slice of the pie.

As it was, Lane was drafted late
in the first round (23rd by the
Denver Nuggets), and because of
the NBA salary cap (the Nuggets
had only $550 left under their
team salary cap), Lane will

Last years graduates
trying to make impact

in the pros

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Ask anyone involved in the
coaching or managing of a Na-
tional Football League team and
he'll readily acknowledge the
University of Pittsburgh as being
a full-fleged gold mine when it
comes to finding quality football
players.

Tex Schramm of the Dallas
Cowboys loves the Panther foot-
ball program. Always has. Miami
Dolphins’ head coach Don Shu-
la likes ”Pitt guys because they
are always tough.”

With the passing of the 1987
football season, another group of
Panther players packed up and
headed off to NFL camps in
hopes of finding a place on a
team's roster, including five start-
ers from Pitt's nationally ranked
defense and two starters from the
offense.

Former running back Craig

|ronhead” Heyward was draft-

this season

ed as the 23rd player on the first
round by the New Orleans Saints.

Heyward rushed for 1,791 yards -

last season — the second best
single-season mark in Panther his-
tory —- and scored 12 touch-
downs. His rushing total was only
three yards short of the nation's
leading ground gainer, Robert
”|ckey” Woods of UNLV.

Heyward, who once played in
excess of 280 pounds while with
Pitt, is still well above the aver-
age playing weight of other NFL
backs, but Saints head coach Jim
Mora has expressed his confi-
dence in ”lronhead”, and will al-
low Heyward to play at any
weight he feels comfortable. ‘

”lronhead” is battling Rueben
Mayes for the starting fullback po-
sition on the team.

Cornerback Quintin Jones was
a surprising second round selec-
tion of the Houston Oilers. As of
this writing, Jones has turned
down several offers by the club,

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 29, I988

Fox keeping Panther defense on

By Vince Carey
The Pitt News

For the past two seasons, Pitt's
defense has been perhaps the
strongest part of the team, finish-
ing in the Top 10 in the country
in total-defense both seasons.

While most of the credit goes
to the players, the man behind
the scenes is defensive coordina-
tor and secondary coach John
Fox.

Fox, 33, came to Pitt in 1986
and quickly made a difference. In
his first season, the Panther

’ defense finished ninth in the

country, and last season it rose to
fourth.

”When we came in here two .

years ago, there was a lot of talk
about how bad defensively the
team had been,” said Fox. ”Bas-
ically, we just tried to give the
kids confidence, sell them on

themselves and what hard work
will do. We just talked about im-
proving.

”We tell the kids to set their
goals high. We feel we can im-
prove in every category.”

Fox was a defensive back for
San Diego State from 1977 to
1979 and stayed on as a gradu-
ate assistant while he worked on
a teaching degree.

’’I was going to be a high
school teacher and coach,” Fox
said, ”but at the time they wer-
en't hiring any teachers in the
state of California.

’’Meanwhile, I was offered a
job as defensive coordinator at a
small Division II school in San
Diego called USIU [United States
International University]. From
there, it just sort of snowballed
and I've been in coaching ever
since.

Under The Big Top

 

With all due regard toTV Christianity,
have you ever seen a

   to es for third straight campaign

guise. If I had gone down to the
high school level, I probably
would have wanted to get into
the college ranks. This way I
didn't spend five or six years in
high school. I went right into col-
lege football.”

Fox has been something of a
journeyman coach. In 1980, he
moved to Boise State, then on to
Long Beach State in 1981. He
landed in Utah in 1982, Kansas
in 1983, Iowa State in 1984, back
to Kansas in 1985 and then on to
Pitt.

In the spring of ’85, Fox had a
stint with the Los Angeles Express

of the United States Football

League.

”Working for the Express was
an experience,” Fox said. ”I was
there in the final year of the
USFL. Our owner was involved
in a real estate scandal, and the
league eventually took us over.
From that standpoint it was kind
of a different experience.

”Pro ball has its plusses and
minusses. I really enjoyed it. I
learned a lot of football and
found out how pro football
operates.”

Fox worked with Pitt coach
Mike Gottfried while at Kansas
and was one of the first coaches
Gottfried brought to Pitt.

”John is a very good coach,”
Gottfried said. ”He is very
knowledgeable about the game
of football. He is dedicated to the
team. I like working with him.

”John’s fundumentals are very
strong. He has great rapport with
the players. He's got everything
that I consider a good coach.”

The admiration is mutual.

’’I really enjoyed working with
Coach Gottfried on the Kansas
staff,” Fox said. ’’I knew how suc-
cessful he could make a team.

”I consider Pitt one of the top
20 programs in the nation. I
didn't know much about the city
of Pittsburgh when I came here,
and that's been a pleasant sur-
prise. I knew about Pitt football
and Mike Gottfried.”

Defensive end Camel Smith
has played for two years under
Fox and likes the direction the
defense is going.

coach that makes everybody

and current negotiations are at a
standstill. Jones has yet to report
to the Oilers camp.

Jones, a two-year starter, had
two fumble recoveries and an in-
terception last season for the
Panthers.

Defensive end Jon Carter was
taken by the New York Giants in
the fifth round and will have a
tough time finding a position on
one of the best rosters‘ in profes-
sional football. The Giants, Super
Bowl champions in 1987, are
considered to have one of the
best defensive lines in football.

Carter had six sacks for the Pan-
thers in 1987. A

Zeke Gadson, the most notable
member of the 1987 Panther
defense, was taken by the Buffa-
lo Bills in the fifth round of the
draft. A converted linebacker in
college, Gadson has changed po-
sitions again and was practicing
at the free safety position in Buffa-
lo. Gadson compiled an amazing
24‘/2 sacks last season —— a school
record — and led the team in
tackles with 137. He was a
finalist for the Butkus Award,
given to the nation's best defen-
sive player. Gadson was eventu-
ally released by the Bills on
August 16, and was later signed
by the Oilers.

Two—year starter Gary Richard
was a seventh-round selection by
the Green Bay Packers. The Pack-
ers, under first-year head coach
Lindy Infante, are trying to bolster
a defense that has been one of the
worst in the ‘ league in recent

years. Richard, a lightning-quick .

cornerback, deflected 16 passes
last season and intercepted one
pass. He is best remembered for
blocking a-crucial field-goal“ at-
tempt that helped preserve, Pitt's
victory over Penn State in 1987.

Strong safety Billy Owens, the
third member of the Panther
secondary to be drafted, was
taken by the Dallas Cowboys in
the 11th round. Owens had 95
tackles and one interception last
season. -

Center Ed Miller was also taken
in the 11th round. The San Die-
go Chargers drafted him in a
search to improve their aging
offensive line.

Several other Panthers who
were not drafted were invited to
NFL camps as free agents, in-
cluding:

0 One-time starter Sal Genilla,
who is battling John Fourcade for
the third quarterback position on
the New Orleans Saints.

0 Wide receiver Michael
Stewart, with the New York

. Giants.

0 Defensive back Teryl Austin,
who is fighting for a position with
the defending Super Bowl cham-

_pion Washington Redskins.

Three Panther free agents who
tried out with pro clubs are no
longer with their respective
teams. Linebacker Jerry Wall was
signed by Cleveland, but he
voluntarily left the Browns early
in the preseason, and placekick-
er Mark Brasco was signed by the
Detroit Lions and released.

Junior running back Brian Da-
vis, who earlier in the summer
became academically ineligible
to play for Pitt, was included in
the NFL supplemental draft but
was passed over by all 28 teams.

He signed a free agent contract
with Cleveland, then also left
camp voluntarily.

returns. Junior Carnel Smith, who
started half of Pitt's games last
season, will start at left end, while
red shirt freshman Richard Allen
will start at left tackle.

The linebackers will see some
changes from last year. Prentiss
Wright returns as weakside line-
backer after spending last year at
the fullback spot, and freshman
Curtis Bray is also bound to see
playing time at that position once
he recovers from off—seas'on knee
surgery.

Freshmen Mike Chalenski and
Ricardo McDonald will battle for
the strongside slot, with Eric
Holzworth, a linebacker convert-
ed to center and back to lineback-
er, also in the picture. N

Senior middle linebacker Jerry
Olsavsky, ”one of the best line-
backers in the country,” accord-
ing to Gottfried, will return to
provide leadership and ex-
perience to the linebacking
corps.

ing secondary members has left

and relatively inexperienced.

safety and will be counted on to
provide leadership for younger
members of the secondary, with
sophomore DougHetzler provid-
ing depth at the position.

Louis Riddick returns as strong
safety after spending most of last
year on the other side of the ball
at fullback.

Senior right cornerback Cornell
Holloway came on strong at the
end of last season, and junior
Alonzo Hampton will see his first
playing time in a Pitt uniform
since transferring from a junior
college two seasons ago.

Overall, the team is exactly
what Gottfried said it would be:
young and talented.

But the experience that counts
— the experience of a bowl game
last year — may help the team

return again this year, Gottfried
said. I

And if the past is any indica-

tion, look for the team to improve
on last year's finish. Gottfried has
produced 5-5-1 and 8-4 records
in the past two years, and with
the recent long-term contract he
signed, his goal in the 19905
might be to go undefeated, not
just get to a bowl.

Mike Gottfried came to the
University of Pittsburgh three
years ago as the 30th head coach
in Pitt football history after spend-
ing three productive years as the
head coach at the University of
Kansas. After two years of in-
tegrating his system into the Pitt
football program, he coached the
Panthers to their most successful
season since 7983, when the
team went 8-3-1 and earned a
bid to the Fiesta Bowl against

- Ohio State.

Gottfried's I987 Panthers
finished the regular season 8-3,
with victories over Notre Dame,
Penn State and West Virginia,
among others, and they were in-
vited to the Bluebonnet Bowl in
‘Houston, where they ultimately
lost to Texas, 32-27.

Gottfried then went on to sign
one of the top 10 recruiting class-
es in the country for the second
straight year, which included four

of the top 700 players in the

country..

The university was obviously
pleased with the progress of Gott-
fried's team, so much so that
Gottfried was signed to a report-
ed lifetime contract. Gottfried
returned the favor, showing his
commitment to the school by
donating $50,000 to the building

of a new indoor athletic facility I

to be located behind Trees Hall.

But the progress of the season
was somewhat marred by profes-
sional agents who signed some
Pitt players to contracts prior to
graduation. Gottfried lashed out
at the agents, calling them "vul-
tures." The agents, as well as
some players, fought back verbal-
ly, accusing a member of the Pitt

 

coaching staff of awarding
money to Craig Heyward for
promoting a Detroit-based com-
pany by wearing a jacket bearing
its insignia during the Bluebon-
net Bowl. They also claimed that,
despite Gottfried's strong stand
against agents, he had allegedly
allowed a few of them into both
the Pitt locker room and the lock-
er room in Houston.

‘It is believed the NCAA may
launch an investigation into the
allegations against Pitt, but no
official announcement has yet
been made.

Gottfried believes that the
agent problems are now behind
him, although not totally forgot-
ten, and that more pressing mat-
ters are at hand. ‘

Gottfried and his wife, Mickey,
and daughters, Mindy and Mar-
cy, have made a successful tran-
sition to living in Pittsburgh.
Gottfried's contract has provided
stability that has made their ac-
climation that much easier.

And as the 1988 season quick-
ly approaches, Gottfried is trying
to make the Pitt football team's
transformation to his style of play
a successful one. He is attempt-
ing to become only the fifth
coach in Pitt football history to
take his team to back-to-back
bowl games and re-establish Pitt

‘ as one of the dominant powers in

college football.

Q: When you came here three
years ago, you were quoted as
saying you thought you could
build a national champion here.

Do you still believe that is true?

A: Yeah, I think we still have to
build, though. We've got to
build. We need more players, we
need another good recruiting
year. What I said was, you have
the opportunity here. You can at-
tract good players, you can attract
good students. The University of
Pittsburgh not only has a great tra-

dition of football, but it has a lot
of tradition academically. People
have to understand we're one of
the transplant centers of the
world, and you take the academ-
ic fields here, they're all strong.
So we can recruit here. And if
you recruit, then you coach —
and you have to get lucky.
There's a schedule, and the
schedule is a lot tougher every
year in and year out. And the par-
ity and the NCAA scholarships
are all things you have to look at
and know that they're going to af-
fect trying to win that. ‘Cause
there's only going to be one to
win that every year.

Q: Was Pitt a school that al-
ways interested you, or was it just
the fact that the opening was
available? '

A: No, I'm from Ohio, about
three and a half hours from here,
so I've always known about Pitts-
burgh. I coached in Youngstown
—— high school ball — when John-
ny Majors was coaching here in
1976, so I followed the program.
Always when I was growing up,

- I heard of the Pitt teams and the

tradition and so forth, and of
course the city. I love the city. I
spent some time in Cincinnati,
and people always said that Cin-
cinnati and Pittsburgh were a lot

“alike and I found that to be true.

I'm very happy and my family is
very happy.

Q: You are obviously commit-
ted to Pitt. You signed a long term
contract and. donated $50,000 to
the ‘building of a new indoor
sports facility. You see yourself at
Pitt for quite some time?

A: I hope so. I want to be. I
think that was the idea. I ap-
preciated the committment of the
university, and I felt the same way
on the other hand. I think the
tough thing is when you go
around and recruit; you recruit a
Darnell Dickerson, you want to
see him graduate, you want to

 

Mike Gottfried and the

see him be here. So that was the
whole idea of coming to the
university and staying here.

Q: Do you think that will allow
you to build a program along the
lines of a Michigan or Penn State,
where the recruits know that the
coach that brought them to the
school will be there when they
graduate? :

A: I think that will help. I think
one of the things that helped
Penn State and Michigan, you
mentioned, is that about the same
time Pitt hit a little down cycle,
they did too. When I say that,
Penn State had a 6-5 year but
came out of it right away, I think
a lot ofthe reason they came out
was because of the coach. I think
Michigan did the same thing one
year. They went 6-6 and came

Pitt Athletic Director Ed Bozik signed Gottfried to a reported lifetime contract with the university in April.

University of Pittsburgh have made

back, and they're right back on
the path. I think there's some-
thing about stability, there's

" something about continuity that's
very important in an athletic
department.

Q: Was the contract something
you pushed for, something you
asked for? .

A: No. The university [and] Dr.
Bozik had mentioned it to me,
and of course I was honored that
they would even consider that,
and I thought about it for a long
time before I actually did any-
thing on it. I wanted to make sure

in my own mind —— that was a big‘
decision because I've always had.

a goal to coach in the pros, and
I've always had a goal of winning
a national Championship. 50, you
can't just one day  say, "I want
to do this and do that." A lot of
thought went into it.

Q: Pitt has always been known
for producing quality athletes,
All-Americans and such. But the
last two years have been out-
standing recruiting classes’ for
Pitt. Do you feel that you have
recruited differently than other
coaches, or is it the allure of a big
school like Pitt and a big city like
Pittsburgh that brings athletes
here? '

A: I don't know if I can put it
in one area. I just think that, first
of all, we've obviously got a good
school to recruit to, and I think se-
condly, we've got good people to
recruit —- we've got a lot of help.
And when you have a committ-
ment, that's a big phase, and we
have a committment from Dr.
Posvar here. The city obviously
helps. The people — in recruit-
ing, you sell the people, you sell
the tradition, you sell all the
things Pitt stands for academical-
ly, you know, the Cathedral. So
I think that is why recruiting is
good, because people like what
they see, they like the university,
they like the people, they like the
city overall.

Q: You have a clause in your
contract concerning graduation
rates of your players (Gottfried
recieves an additional sum if a
certain percentage of the team
graduates). Do you feel very
strongly about that?

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 29, I988

 

a commitment to excellence in the Pitt football program.

0

A: Yeah, I really am, because
I think people have to understand
that when you recruit these ath-
letes, like Danny Crossman, or
Larry Wanke, I mean, the person
that recruited these two, I've sat
in their houses and I've sat with
their moms and sat with their
fathers, and I said "hey, we're go-
ing to do all we can can to help
them pursue an education, not
just a degree.” I think sometimes,
when you talk about a degree,
you talk about "Harry got a
degree.” I talk about education.
Get the best instructors here at
the University of Pittsburgh and
learn the most you can in your
field because that's what it's go-
ing to take to be successful in life.
So we constantly talk about that,
and that's our job, that's a part of
it. You've got 95 scholarship
players and 30 players who are
walk-ons, and you try to sit down
with them and be a part of their
learning experience for the next
four or five years. And then it just
doesn't cease after that  there’s
a closeness that you develop
through athletics, and it's some-
thing that you just want to keep
up. To me, it's important.

Q: Is that something you look
for when you recruit as well?

A: Yeah. See, the toughthing

_ with recruiting is, you might see

somebody who maybe is a mar-
ginal student, and you take him
and you take a shot on him, but
you do it for a lot of reasons, be-
cause all of a sudden you find
that you're rooting for somebody.
That, "Hey, I want to see this per-
son do well, I want to see him
come out with an education, I
want to see him be successful.”
So you're all of a sudden rooting
for the kid because you know
more about the family situation...

Q: Before you came to Pitt,
there seemed to be a lack of dis-
cipline on the football team. But
that is something that is not very
apparent anymore. Is that some-
thing you find very important to
you as a coach?

A: I feel very strongly about
that. But then again, there's al-
ways two sides to every story
when something happens, and
certainly Pittsburgh doesn't have

a corner on the market for any-
body getting in trouble. All you
have to do is read the paper ev-
ery day. But it's important to me
that they understand that they
have to know who they are. We
have a rule that you are respon-
sible for your own actions , and
I talked to them  about getting
involved in a wrong decision. It
not only affects you, because no
longer are you just Larry Wanke,
you're Larry Wanke from the
University of Pittsburgh, and
you're also Larry Wanke from
your family, you're Larry Wanke
from your hometown, you're Lar-
ry Wanke from your high school.
You just keep trying to impress
upon them there's decisions to be
made; make the right one. But I
won't hesitate to throw some-
body off. But yet, I also won't
hesitate to look at a problem and
try to find a solution, too, because
I think when you do throw some-
body off the team, that's the eas-
iest thing, yet you're really kind
of hurting the team because you
can't find an answer to that
problem. Then there's the other
return to that, there's the old "rot-
ten apple in a barrel" theory. If
there's one rotten apple in the
barrel, it will spoil the whole
barrel.

Q: In the past, you've had
agent problems. Aside from the
strong stand you've taken, what
do you feel the NCAA can do?

A: I think the NCAA, the
coaches, the athletic directors,
the NFL and the Union ought to
all get together and say, if some-
body adopts and deals with the
player early, that they cannot
negotiate the contract with the
player. You see, the problem
right now is that the NFL feels
one way, that it's not their
problem. The NCAA says "it's
not our problem," the agent says
"it's not our problem.” It ends up
that nobody wants to be the
father of the problem, so until
everybody sits down and says,
"here's what we've got and
here's what to do," it's not going
to be solved  it's a problem
that's all over right now, and it's
a problem that has to be cured,
but it's not going to be cured un-

til everyone sits down and talks
about it.

Q: Do you think the rulings
should stay within sports, like the
NCAA or NFL, or should it be-
come a state or governmental
rule?

A: I think states are helping by
putting in rules, but I don't think
that will stop it. I think it will
help. There's been a lot of strides,
a lot of good things have hap-
pened since the start. I don't
regret anything I ever said or did.
I feel very strongly about what I
did, I feel very strongly about
what I said, and I wouldn't
change any of that. Right now
what I want to do. ...I want to
coach. I could get involved in
one of them a day, but right now
what I want to do is just coach
and get involved with this ball
club.

Q: Some of your players said
that they had signed contracts be-
fore they were graduated, and
that they had come in close con-
tact with agents in the Pitt lock-
er room. Any comment?

A: That's not true. I can't tell
people that that's not true, but it
certainly isn't true. All the things
that happened last year, some of
the allegations, none of them
were true. They were all spon-
sored by an agent out in Arizona
who was working with Craig
Heyward, who was trying to do
his best to try and come back for
the attack I had on the agents. I
knew that, I knew when I lashed
out there was going to be a back-
lash. I still felt very strongly that
I was right, and I didn't care what
the results were or what they tried
to do. The jacket deal and Craig
Heyward, we talked about, the
agent situation about Sal Sunseri

Gottfried's coaching has the Panthers on the rebound from losing and mediocre seasons.

or Mitch Dukov was all unfound-
ed. Ed Bozik, I told him when I
got the letter from Sal; and I took
them to him; and I said here's the
letters, the accusations, before
they actually hit the paper. Sal
was actually working with the
people to try to bring these things
about. So it's not true.

Q: Craig Heyward seems to
have caused the most problems.
Was there any friction before he
left Pitt?

A: Well, how I think the friction
began was the fact of how it all
ended, when I sat down with him
and talked about the situation,
and some of the things he told me
at that time that I've never gone
public with, that involved Eric
Metz, Bruce Allen and some of
those people. At that point, when
he did disclose to me some of
those dealings that happened
with those people is when I
decided to do what I did. But I've
never told anybody, "this is what
he told me, and this [is] what
these people did,” because I
didn't feel this was anybody's
business. Why he did that I don't
know.

Q: So, do you think there's
been a change in the attitude of
college ballplayers, some ball-
players who know that they can
go far, maybe a money-driven
change?

A: I don't think so. I think in so-
ciety, as with anything, there are
changes, but I think basically to-
day's no different than it was 20
years ago. You look at people,
some people are really motivat-
ed, some people challenge right
and wrong. I feel very strongly
that they're just as good, have as
much fiber as they did 10, 20, 30,
40 years ago.

 

C-‘I7

Q: Every year, everyone says
the Penn State game is the big-
gest game of the year. Two years
ago, there was a fight on the field
at the Penn State game, and loe
Paterno called Pitt players ”a dis-
grace to the game." That added
fuel to the fire, to the rivalry.
What do you think about that
game and about loe Paterno?
A:First of all, I think it's a big
game, there's no doubt. But to
say it's the biggest game, I think
the biggest game is Northern
Iowa. As a coach, and as a team,
you take them as they come.
When you get to Penn State, it

will be the biggest game, but then-

the next week, you better get
ready for North Carolina State. As
far as Joe Paterno, I have a lot of
respect for him. I think he's a very
good football coach, I think he's
done an awful lot for the college
game.  I think that, again, he's
been a coach for a long time, and
there’s been some unique things
come his way because of that, so
I wish him well. Again, I coach
on this sideline. I really don't
worry about what's over there. I
just work with what I have.

Q: Have you set any definite
goals for this year? Not necessar-
ily to go 8-3.  '

A: No, |wou|dn't put any wins
on it, but we're talking about get-
ting back to another bowl, and
having a winning season. Those
are goals that we always have
here, and I think that they're
realistic goals and goals that we
need to pursue. .

Q: Do you think the fact that
quite a few players on the team
were at a bowl last year will drive
them to get back to one this year?

A: I think it will help. I think it

backs slated in the top spot on the
1988 depth chart.

And things may stay that way.
Gottfried has said that he would
not worry about using both of the
quarterbacks in every game.
”Two quarterbacks can play and
win,” Gottfried said.

Dickerson doesn't see any
potential problems should both
quarterbacks see playing time.
The offensive line and receivers
are familiar enough with both
QBs that they wouldn't see any
major changes in a quarterback
shift.

”... I don't think the offense will

have to be altered for either me
or Larry,” Dickerson said.

Although Dickerson would
seem the probable starter follow-
ing his success and amount of
playing time last season, he sees
last year, and particularly the
Bluebonnet Bowl as a learning
experience.

”It was a tough learning ex-
perience, because we were play-
ing catch-up most of the time.

”But it was good for me in that
it shows how hard I'll have to
work this year,” Dickerson com-
mented.

Crossman, who last season
played in the Panther secondary,
will head into camp with the
starting nod.

”I’m looking forward to it.
There's a lot of things for a full-
back to do,” Crossman said.
”With Craig gone and Brian
gone, the running backs are go-
ing in thinking we can do the
job.”

With former running backs
Louis Riddick and Prentiss Wright
crossing the trench to help the
defense, Crossman came over to
the offense, but he didn't mind
making the transition.

”I was shocked at first because
it caught me by surprise,” said
the 6-1, I94—pound junior. ”With
the coaches bringingathe guys
over, wherever I would go was
fine. I have no regrets and I'm
pleased with the decision.

”I feel I can do everything. I
can catch, block, do whatever the
coaching staff needs. I have no

personal goals. When they give.
me the ball, I just want to make
the most of it,” added Crossman.

Like Walker, Crossman feels
competition brings out the best in
him, and with former linebacker
Jeff Christy second on the depth
chart, he just might get it. '

”We feel Jeff fits that fullback
position because of his tough-
ness,” said Gottfried.

”I’m happy about the move.
There's going to be a lot of com-
petition,” said Christy, a sopho-
more. ”They have the speed, I
have the size.”

Christy [6-2, 230 pounds]_is no
stranger to the running back po-
sition. At Freeport High School,
he rushed for 2,842 yards and
scored 45 touchdowns in his
career.

Although he played well last
season — recording 35 tackles —
he feels offense will become his
”forte.”

”I’m here to stay now. I don't
want to get bounced around,” he

said.

. Crossman is looking forward to
Christy's new assignment. ”|t’s
going to be fun. I think it's a good
move by the coaches.”

Derrick Lewis, a 6-2,
230—pound freshman, is listed as
the team's third fullback. Lewis,
from Rayen High School in
Youngstown, Ohio, rushed for
4,350 yards on 395 carries, aver-
agingjust better than 11 yards per
carry in the process.

With Heyward no longer
around to carry the bulk of the
offensive production, Liggins still
thinks these ’’young, inex-
perienced” runners will make a
major contr_ibution this season.

’’I see the running game play-
ing a little different of a role. I
think these guys are more of a
breakaway threat,” said Liggins.

”Craig was the guy who got the
big yardage, but these guys have
the chance to break all the way,”
he added. ‘

around him a better player,”
Smith said. ”He is a perfectionist
and a disciplinarian, but very fair.
He treats everybody like men, not
little kids. That way he gets bet-

‘ ter results than others might.”

After coaching for nine years,
Fox is still finding it fun and

wouldn't want to trade it in for
any other job.

”I don't consider coaching a

I wonder what it would be like to
have a real job?’

ery morning. Not too many peo-
ple can say that. I worked some
labor jobs when I was playing,
and you dread getting up to go to
work.”

Aside from the working part,
Fox also enjoys the intangibles of
a coaching job.

”I enjoy being around young
people, it makes you feel young.

The kids are probably the best

part about it. They're highly moti-
vated. They are willing to learn.

”The camaraderie is also a big
factor. Coaches are probably a lot
closer in a working situation than
real estate brokers. You're with
your fellow coaches 16 to 18
hours a day. Your families are
close. It is a very good working
situation.”

But coaching is a little tougher
than Fox may lead you to believe.
Every day is a new experience.

”Week—to—week, the competi-
tion level is high. Every day you
are measured. Most jobs, you just
go to work and pick up your
paycheck. In our job it is a week-
to-week, measurable type of
thing.”

Fox's work thus far has provid-
ed great dividends for the Panther
defense, as well as the entire
team. And with the dedication he
has shown through his first two
years at the university, even a
defense as young as this year's
squad should again be a formid-

Secondary hinges on Washington's leadership

By Matt Martin
and Ron Hudak

One glaring weakness of the
Pitt football team this season is
the lack of senior leadership.
Only one dozen upperclassmen
return, not all of them starters.

Possibly nowhere on the team
is this lack of experienced play-
ers more visible than in the defen-
sive secondary.

Last year's secondary unit was
regarded as one of the best in the
country, sending four members
— free safety Teryl Austin, strong
safety Billy Owens and corner-

backs Gary Richard and Quintin
Jones —— on to the pro ranks after
graduation. These players helped
Pitt to the fourth best overall
defensive statistics in the country
last year.

So this year's secondary will
have quite a reputation to live up
to, despite the fact that only one
player, 6-foot-2, 190-pound free
safety Troy Washington, has the
experience thought necessary to
build a solid defensive backfield.

But Washington has different
ideas. "Experience is the only
difference [compared to last
year]," Washington said. ’'I think

Alonzo Hampton can match up
to Gary Richard. I think Cornell
Holloway could probably match
up to Quintin Jones. I think Louis
Riddick and Billy Owens are
about the same. I feel the same
way with Teryl and I, but Tery|’s
gone now. I think we'll do pretty
good/’

Washington's presence could
be the key to the success of the
secondary. Last season, he start-
ed all 12 games, finishing with 77
tackles and a team high of two in-
terceptions. The Street and
Smith's preseason All East candi-
date also had’ a game-high 17

tackles in a 6-3 victory at West
Virginia last year.

But with the absence of three
of last year's four starters,
Washington sees an even more
important role in front of him.

"I really like the challenge. I al-
ways wanted to be a leader.
Coming in here my freshman
year, I never could have really
dreamed of this. Now it's my
senior year, and everyone’s look-
ing to me for leadership. We've
got a lot of young guys, but they
know — if they don't know, we'll
try to let them know —— that, ‘hey,
this is big time ball,’ "Washing-

ton said.

"We made it to a bowl game
last year, but we've got to do bet-
ter than that. We're out here to
play a game, and we've got be
ready," he added.

The "we" is Riddick, a 6-3,

played fullback last season;
Hampton, a 6-0, 190-pound
junior college transfer who sat
out last season; and Holloway, a

cond season out of Snow Junior

Jerry Olsavsky will anchor the defense at middle linebacker.

  

Pitt News File Photo

C-2 ‘I

Olsa vsky should make lasting

impression on opposing offenses

By Sam Tallarico
Assistant Sports Editor

This season will start the way
they usually do for Panther line-
backer Jerry Olsavsky.

With preseason honors.

Despite missing three full
games after having arthroscopic
knee surgery early last season,
Olsavsky has still placed promi-
nently in the pollsters’ eyes.

According to Don Heinrich’s
College Football, he's listed as a
Second Team All-American and
The Sporting News has him as
the 14th-best inside linebacker in
the nation.

He's also been named Athlon
All-East, The Sporting News,
Football Action, and Don Hein-
rich’s College Football Second
Team All-Independent Teams.

Not too bad for someone who
is not exactly built for his po-
sition.

At 6—foot-2, 218 pounds, Ol-
savsky sometimes has to respond
to ball carriers and others who
outweigh him with reckless aban-
don, but that doesn't concern Ol-
savsky. A

’’.I try not to think about it. If I
do, I might do something differ-
ently and that might take me out
of my game,” said Olsavsky.
”You have to have faith in what
you can do.”

The way Olsavsky has played
in his three seasons at Pitt, the
less he thinks of it, the better.

Last season, he recorded 101
tackles — third-highest on the
team despite the injury, and he

had 17 tackles in both the Penn ’

State and Notre Dame games —
and added 5‘/2 sacks. He also
returned a punt for 21 yards and
recovered a fumble.

As a junior, he played in all 11
games and registered 127 tackles,
2‘/2 sacks and one interception,
which he returned for a touch-
down against Navy.

If Olsavsky can stay healthy this
season and record 100 tackles, he
could be the first Panther since
Arnie Weatherington (1974-76)
to have three consecutive
100—tackle seasons.

Olsavsky, however, doesn't
look to set goals, at least not for
himself. He doesn't set personal
goals because, well, he doesn't
believe in them. 7

’’I’d like for us to go to a major
bowl like the Orange Bowl and
to have the defense have a real
good season. The offense will
take care of itself,” said Olsavsky.

”lndividual goals don't work;
you have to be a team,” added
Olsavsky, an informational
science major.

As a senior, Olsavsky will be
looked upon to give the‘ team
leadership, since a large part of
last year's defense has moved_on.

Lost from last year's defense are
defensive end Jon Carter, line-
backers Jerry Wall and Zeke Gad-
son -— and his school-record 24‘/2

sacks, and three-fourths of the
starting secondary: Gary Richard,
Billy Owens and Quintin Jones.

Pitt Head Coach Mike Gottfried
realizes the need for Olsavsky as
well as incoming youth.

”Jerry Olsavsky is back and
he's one of the best in the coun-
try.. We could start two freshmen
in those [linebacker] spots," said
Gottfried, in reference to Mike
Chalenski (6-5, 240 pounds from
Kenilworth, NJ.) or Ricardo
McDonald (6-2, 225 pounds
from Paterson, N.J.) at side line-
backer and Gateway High
School's Curtis Bray (6-4, 220
pounds). _

Bray, however, had arthroscop-
ic surgery on his knee and will be
sidelined at least until the Ohio
State game Sept. 17.

”Last year, the defense played

1 real well. They were in the Top

15 in passing, scoring and total
defense. We can still do the same
things we did last year," noted
Gottfried.

”We’re going to need help

from our freshmen this year,” ad-
ded Gottfried.

But don't count the Panther
defense out. They still have
defensive end Burt Grossman,
defensive tackle Marc Spindler
and free safety Troy Washington.

Veteran players to keep an
eye on this fall:

0 Marc Spindler — Spindler,
a 6-foot-5, 270-pound sopho-
more from Scranton, Pa., was
last year's ECAC Rookie-of-
the—Year, and rightfully so.
Spindler made 106 tackles, the

2 most ever by a Pitt freshman

and second most on the team.

Spindler also had one sack
and two fumble recoveries for
the 1987 Panthers. He is one
of only four Pitt freshmen in
the last 20 years to start the
first game of his freshman
year. The others? Tony Dor-
sett, Hugh Green and Bill
Fralic.

0 Troy Washington — “the
only returning starter from last
year's secondary. Washington,
a 6-2, 190—pound senior, led
the team in interceptions last
year with two, and also con-
tributed 77 tackles, 45 unas-
sisted.

Washington is expected to
be the leader of an otherwise

inexperienced defensive»

backfield.

0 Mark Stepnoski —— one of,
if not the best offensive guard
in the country. Stepnoski, who
bench presses a team high 500
pounds, is a candidate for
most every honor in the na-
tion. Hampered by injuries
most of last year, Stepnoski is
at full strength this year and is

expected to be the cornerstone V

of the offensive line.

0 Jerry Olsavsky —— the 6-2,
218-pound senior middle line-
backer was ranked as the 14th
best inside linebacker by The
Sporting News.

Olsavsky was third on the
team in tackles last year with
101, despite missing four
games after arthroscopic knee‘
surgery, and could become
the first Panther to record three
consecutive 100 tackle sea-
sons since 1976.

He will be the leader of an

otherwise inexperienced
defense’.
‘O Dean Caliguire —

Caliguire, a 6-3, 265—po'und
junior, was an All-East guard
last season but has been
moved to center.

0 Darnell Dickerson — a
6-4, 200-pound . sophomore
quarterback started four games
last season, including the
Bluebonnet Bowl in Houston.

Dickerson completed 35 of
93 passes for 375 yards and
one touchdown and is Pitt's

most experienced returning

quarterback.

He also allows the Pitt
offense more optionswith his
scrambling ability, rushing for
78‘ yards and one touchdown
last year.

Dickerson is 3-1 as a starter.

0 Larry Wanke — another
sophomore battling for the

"starting quarterback slot.

Wanke has limited game ac-
tion but has the ability to step

13 of 27 attempts for three
touchdowns last season, all
three TDs coming in the Blue-
bonnet Bowl after Dickerson
was injured.

0 Reggie Williams — the
6-2, 190—pound junior split
end was Pitt's top receiver last
season, catching 31 passes for
535 yards and three
touchdowns.

0 Billy Osborn —- Osborn
has been one of the most con-
sistent players on the team for
the past two years, amassing
755 yards receiving and six
touchdowns.

The 6-0, 190—pound senior
was the top receiver two years
ago and was named a presea-
son member of Don Hein-
rich’s College Football
All-Independent Team.

The receiving corps overall
was billed the second best
among all major independent
schools by The Sporting
News.

0 Burt Grossman — The
NFL Draft Report listed Gross-
man as the highest-rated
defensive end in the country.

field. His experience will be
beneficial,” Fox said.

”l’ll be there to calm the guys
down ifthings get tight in a close
situation,” Washington said.
”Teams will come out throwing
against us in the beginning. A
mistake in the game can cost you
the game, so we'll have to
eliminate those.”

Fox knows he has a young
team to work with and will alter
his game plan accordingly.
”There is no substitute for ex-
perience, and we won't know
how the new guys will play until
they get in a game situation. In
the beginning of the season, you
might see us playing a little more
zone than man-to—man.”

Although this year may not
yield the same statistics as last,
Fox believes the players he has to
work with will make a definite
contribution.

”They all have the ability, and
the younger guys also have years
remaining. Only time will help us
determine about the experience
factor. So far, they all have
showed good progress and can
only improve,” Fox said. '

Van Horne trying to
regain freshman form
after off year

By Sam Tallarico
Assistant Sports Editor

Coming into_last season, Jeff
VanHorne was on the verge of
becoming the Panthers’ finest
placekicker since Carson Long of
the mid ’70s.

VanHorne was fresh off a fresh-
man season that saw him convert
all 29 extra points and hit 11 of
17 field goals.

Last season, however, some-
thing didn’t click. VanHorne’s ac-
curacy dropped as the season
progressed. An ankle injury late
in the season didn't help matters
much.

At season's end, VanHorne
made 10 of23 field goals and 23
of 26 extra points.

When the Panthers open their
99th season of football Saturday,
VanHorne will be more ex-
perienced and, more important-
ly, positive.

”I’ve never been more excited.
I've worked hard all summer and
I'm looking forward to the
season.

”Last year, it wasn't like I set
too high of goals, but too many.
I'm looking optimistically
towards this season. My first goal
is to help the team to a January
1st bowl game. I want to contrib-
ute to that.

’’I’d like to break a few records,
but the main thing is to help the
team to win,” added VanHorne.

VanHorne’s positive attitude
could also be attributed to the
fact he’s healthy and ready to go.

”The ankle is 100 percent.
Over the summer, I was kicking,
running, bicycling and swim-
ming. Swimming helped to get
my legs loosened up," said Van-
Horne. ”Stretching helped too.
Flexibility is the key.

”I cut down on the angle of my
kicks. I'll do everything to help us
to a big bowl,” he added.

The injury to his ankle can be
traced back to his high school
days at Cheney in Spokane, WA.
VanHorne broke his ankle at
Cheney and, last season, bone
chips and bone spurs had
returned to alter his kicking.

Although he kicked in pain, he
still felt he was capable of
kicking.

”I don't know about the situa-
tion. All I know was I wanted to
kick and I wanted to help the
team. I was getting rehabilitation
and doing exercises for my ankle.
After the operation, I was still un-
dergoing rehabilitation,” noted
VanHorne.

Panther head coach Mike Gott-
fried is confident VanHorne can
come back and regain his fresh-
man form, partly due to his at-
titude.

”Jeff’s a hard worker, he’s con-
sistent and he’s competent,” said
Gottfried. ”He’s always compe-
tent in what he wants to ac-
complish.

”He (lid a good job for us in
spring drills. Scott O'Brien [spe-
cial teams coach] likes what he
sees in Jeff this year.

”Jeff is a very good kicker,”
Gottfried added.

In the second week of the 1986
season, VanHorne displaced
Mark Brasco as the team's start-

2-‘

in ’87

mg kicker. Since that time, the
job has been VanHorne’s. It
wasn't a job to win, but only for
him to lose.

This season, Gottfried has
brought in another kicker, Scott
Kaplan of Coral Springs, FL, who
was considered by some to be
the best kicker in Florida last
year, and he even made a video
for recruiting purposes.

In other words, VanHorne has
competition for the first time
since he’s been here, but he’s
looking forward to it.

”I think it's great. It will just
make me work that much hard-
er. It’ll be great having good com-
petition.

”| feel ifl can compete against
myself and do my best, then I
can't do anymore than that,”
VanHorne added.

”They’ll compete and it will be
good for everyone,” said Gott-
fried. ”Scott did very well. But,
until you put him in a pressure sit-
uation, you really can't tell.’’

While some may feel Van-
Horne had an off year, others
may claim he’s lost his touch.
Gottfried won't give up so easily.

”He won the West Virginia
game [he kicked both field goals
in a 6-3 win at Morgantown]. He
missed some last year, but he’s
been a consistent kicker for us.
You have to realize he was only
a sophomore,” said Gottfried.

Panther recruiting class one of Gmtfried

the best in

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

There's a changing of the guard
on the Pitt football team this sea-
son. Only 12 seniors return to
provide leadership to the squad,
which means more than a few
underclassmen will see plenty of
playing time.

Of those underclassmen, many
will be freshmen. But they won't
be playing out of necessity. Ac-
tually, they may become a great
asset to the Panther squad.

For the second year in a row,
Pitt has recruited one of the top
ten freshman classes in the
country.

Four of Pitt's recruits were rat-
ed in the top 100 players in the
country by recruitng expert Max
Emfinger: '

0 Mike Chalenski, linebacker,
Kenilworth, N.J.- 10th.

0 Curtis Bray, linebacker, Mon-
roeville, Pa. — 15th.

0 Calvertlones, tackle, Erving-
ton, Va.- 52_nd.

0 Baron Jackson, wide
receiver, Baton Rouge, La.- 67th.

Chalenski will challenge for a
starting spot at the strongside line-
backer spot after expected start-
er Todd Pipkin moved to
defensive end to provide depth.

Chalenski, 6-foot-5 and 240
pounds, was the most heavily
recruited player in New Jersey
last year, and rightfully so. The
first-team USA Today and Parade
All-American made 140 tackles,
blocked seven passes and had
five interceptions as a senior.

Bray is equally accredited.
Considered the top high school
prospect in the country by many
recruiting services, the 6-4,
220-pound linebacker was

country again in '88

named the Gatorade/Circle of
Champions Player of the Year. A
fine all-around athlete, Bray had
87 tackles and three interceptions
as a senior and was named the
Post—Gazette 1988 Male Athlete
of the Year.

Jones, a 6-5, 270-pound right
tackle, was a second-team Bally
All-American and first-team All-
State in Virginia as a junior and
senior. He was named the offen-
sive player of the year in the
Lynchburg area.

Jackson, despite having the
lowest rating of the four, may ac-
tually turn out tovbe the best of
the same group. He holds the
American scholastic record for in-
terceptions with 62.

The 6-2, 190-pound USA To-
day and Parade All-American
also holds national records in
touchdown passes caught (21 as
a junior), and career punt returns
for touchdowns (11).

Jackson caught 29 passes for
656 yards and nine touchdowns
last season and will continue
playing wide receiver rather than
defensive back at Pitt, despite his
skills in the secondary.

Other reasons Pitt's recruiting
class is so highly rated:

0 Anthony DeLazio, a 6-4,
250- pound offensive lineman
from Whitehall, Pa.

The first-team USA Today All-
American and member of The
Sporting News Top 100 has
broken seven state powerlifting
records and can powerlift a total
of 1,350 pounds.

0 Fullback Derrick Lewis from
Youngstown, Ohio. Lewis, 6-2,
230 pounds, ran for 4,350 yards
in his career and was named a
second-team All-American by
Emfinger.

0 Mike LiVorio, 6-5, 250-
pound offensive lineman from
Gateway High School and a USA
Today All-American.

0 Glenn Deveaux, a 5-11, 200-
pound running back from Rock-
ledge High School in Cocoa, FL.
Deveaux rushed for 668 yards on
81 carries as a senior, despite a
neck injury that held him out for
two games. Was named his
school's Most Outstanding Back.

0 Gary Gorajewski, defensive
lineman from No. 1 ranked North
Hil|s‘High School. The 6-4, 230-
pound Gorajewski was named
first-team All-State after making
177 tackles as a senior, helping
North Hills first-team defense re-
main unscored upon.

0 Scott Kaplan, a 6-1, 180-
pound placekicker from Coral
Springs, FL. Had a season best
47-yard field goal, and kicked a
67—yarder field goal in a practice
session.

0 Curvin Richards, a 5-10, 190-
pound tailback from Laporte, TX.
Richards is expected to see time
behind Adam Walker and Ronald
Redmon this year. He ran for
1,159 yards and 14 touchdowns
as a senior, and is Laporte’s all-
time leading rusher with 3, 745
yards.

0 Alex Van Pelt, a 6-2, 200
pound quarterback from Chur-
chill High School in San Antonio,
TX. Van Pelt was named the San
Antonio Express Player of the
Year after passing for 1,275 yards
and 12 touchdowns as a senior.
Is expected to be the third-string
quarterback this season.

will actually be positive and kind
of a reinforcement that they've
been there now, so let's go, and
let's try to get back again.

Q: Over the winter you were
tabbed as a possible replacement
for the head coaching job with
the Green Bay Packers. Up to
that point, you never tried to hide
the fact that you wanted to coach
in the NFL. How do you feel
now, after having signed the long
term contract?

A: The thing that happened
with the Green Bay situation was
I was coaching in the Hula Bowl
and [Packers coach] Forrest
Gregg was going to resign that
particular day, eastern time, we'll
say one o'clock. The general
manager of Green Bay stopped
me coming off the field and asked
would I be interested in talking to
him about it, so he came up to
my room, talked to me about the
job, asked if he could meet me
again, which I said at that time he
could. I met him the second time,
but after the second time was the
same night that Curtis Bray decid-
ed to come to Pittsburgh, and he
told us he would commit, so I
told him at that time that I was no
longer interested in the Green
Bay thing. I just felt good about
Pittsburgh — I feel good about
being there, and I feel good about
my family. My family enjoys it
too. I think that's something that
I want to do for long time.

Q: Do you still have any NFL
aspirations?

A: Well, I can't say I don't. I
don't feel  like when I signed
this contract that was something
that would remove that, and I
wanted to stay at Pitt a long time.
So, right now, my only goal is to
be at Pitt for a long, long time.

Q: Quite a few people are un-
happy that the athletic depart-
ment decided to drop the season
opener against Maryland in favor
of Northern Iowa. What was the
reasoning behind this?

A: ...I think people have to look
at what people are trying
schedule-wise across the country.
I haven't gone back and

\/

researched the schedules that
much, but you like to have seven
home games. You see what Penn
State's trying to do right now,
also. The Maryland thing was
kind of a dual situation, where
they needed to get a home game
and we needed to get a home
game, so we just decided to post-
pone it for a couple years. I think,
again, you see more and more
people trying to get seven home
games. Next year, I think we have
six, and the following year we'll
be close to seven again. Then
there's another year coming
where we're only going to have
five. So, we just try to get our
schedules so we're playing good
teams, yet trying to get as many
home games as possible.

Q: What type of mark would
you like to say you've left at Pitt
in your first three years here?

A: I'd like it to be I'd like
somebody to say it's a program
that people are proud of. It’s
honest, it's run honestly, consis-
tently and within the rules. And
I think that our players are not
only gaining as football players
but also gaining in a lot of other
areas. It's a program where
they're gonna have fun, but it's
also gonna be a part of the educa-
tional process. If that can happen,
and I can be a small part of that,
because I'm only a small part of
that, then I'll be very proud.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 29, W88

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

Denise Frawley enters her
senior year on the threshold of
becoming Pitt's first All-
American volleyball player,
but her goals for the season
revolve, first and foremost,
around her team.

”My goals for the season are
for the team to win the Big East
Championship, qualify at large
for the NCAA Tournament and
to get past the first round of the
tournament, which is not at all
impossible,” observed
Frawley.

”l think about playing my
hardest and my best for my
team, and if All-American
honors happen to come along,
great,” she added.

Coming to Pitt from West-
lake High School in Thorn-
wood, N.Y., the 5—foot—lO
Frawley has won numerous
accolades in her three previ-
ous years with the Lady Pan-
thers. She was chosen to play
in the National Sports Festival
at the conclusion of her fresh-

man and sophomore years.

The hard-hitting Frawley
was selected to the All-Big East
team the last two years, cul-
minating with her selection as
Big East Player of the Year last
season. Additionally, she was
named an Honorable Mention
All-American by Volleyball
Monthly.

Despite the recognition she
has earned from her freshman
year on, Frawley feels her
game has improved in a num-
ber of areas. ”My skill levelas

,a freshman was nowhere near

where it is now, offensively or
defensively. My shot selection
is much improved, as well as
my serve reception and block-
ing skills,” said Frawley.

Pitt coach Shelton Collier
has noted the changes in
Frawley’s game and attitude
over the last three years.

”Denise really wants to ex-
Jcel in all aspects of the game.
It is comparable to a great
scorer in basketball deciding
he wants to be known for
other aspects of the game,”
noted Collier.

Fra wley expected to provide
leadership for volleyball team

”Denise has improved in
the areas of attitude and
leadership as well as playing
an improved all-around game
in the lastithree years. The
most important thing is the
time and determination she
spent in the off-season into be-
ing in top condition.”

Frawley goes into her senior
year regarded as the top-
ranked player in the Big East
Conference.

She will be the top gun on
a young Lady Panther team
which will look to her to pro-
vide leadership as well as in-

spirational play. Being in.

superior shape as well as be-
ing more determined and dis-
ciplined than ever, Frawley is
ready to leave her indelible
mark on Pitt volleyball.
”Denise is one of the more
rewarding players I've had a
chance to work with. She has
always had a lot of ability and
she has had her ups and

‘ downs.

”Now, the fruits of her labor
and my working with her as a
coach are occurring.”

 

Volleyball team looks  

for continued success

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

The Pitt women's volleyball
team — coming off of one of its
most successful seasons ever —
opens the season on September
2 at the Ball State Invitational.

Last season, the Lady Panthers
roared through their schedule,
winning 22 matches in a row at
one point. They earned their se-
cond consecutive NCAA Tourna-
ment berth and finished the year
with a 37-6 record.

Despite losing four pivotal
seniors (Noreen Coughlin, Louise
O’Shaughnessy, Lisa Stewart and
Krista Ziener) from last year's
team, Pitt coach Shelton Collier
is excited about the possibilities
of the upcoming season for a
number of reasons..

”First, we will be playing the-
most difficult schedule in Pitt a

volleyball history this season. By
playing 14 or 15 matches against
nationally ranked opponents, we
have the opportunity to continue
establishing ourselves as a nation-
al volleyball power,” said Collier.

Pitt’s coach also noted that a
number of fine players were
returning, and that ”we have

some real good athletes that are A

coming in."

This year's edition of the Lady
Panthers will feature heated com-
petition for starting spots.

Lantagne, is the front—runner, but

Luxbacher hopes to improve on Volleyball

last year's dismal 5-10-1 record

Mark R. Brown

Contributing Editor

The Pitt men's soccer team is
fired up for the 1988 season. Ac-
cording to Coach Joe Luxbacher,
”Last year was disappointing. We
were 5-10-1 for the year. It was
our first losing season since I be-
came coach. Everybody gave and
played hard, every game was wi-
thin reach, but it didn't work out.
We had a few games taken out of
our grasp during the final
moments.’-’

Luxbacher, a Pitt graduate and
a native of Pittsburgh, is begin-
ning his fourth season as soccer
coach. He said that it has been a
good year for recruiting. Only

three seniors were lost to gradu-
ation, and many returning play-
ers have recovered from injuries.

”Sam Lanza is the captain. He's
bouncing back from a broken
jaw. He's a very strong forward.

”A lot of our midfield is return-
ing, although many of the posi-
tions will be determined by
performances during the pre-
season.

”Recruiting has brought us a lot
of talent. Heinz Pak and Mark
Mostinckx transferred from Com-
munity College of Allegheney
County, and they broughtcon—
siderable experience from their
junior college playing/’,said Lux-
bachen.

”Between our returning players

and our recruits, we've got the
potential to have a winning team
this year. We are definitely not
going to have a repeat of last
season. -
”There’s really no new tactics

that we're going to try out this

year. There's no secrets to the
sport. Soccer is a pretty straight-
forward game. It’s not complicat-
ed. We just need to evaluate our
strengths and create a winning
combination of players.” it
, The team's first scrimmage is at
Mount Union, Ohio, on Septem-
ber 1. The first game of the sea-
son is September 14 at Slippery
Rock University, and the first
home game is September 21
against West Virginia University.

Men '5 cross-coun try team ready

By Craig Woshner

For The Pitt News

Please note: Craig Woshner is
a member of the Pitt men's cross
country team. ‘ -

As summer winds down and
the fall term rapidly approaches,
the men's cross country team is
gearing up for what should be
their best season in recent years,
thanks to another successful
recruiting year. ,

The team is coming off an im-
pressive 1987 season in which
the Panthers placed third at the
Big East Championship behind
nationally-ranked Georgetown
and ‘Providence and placed fifth
at the lC4A Eastern Regional.

Head Coach Jim‘Lear'is hoping
the team can cap off last year's
performance and make bigger
strides towards national recog-
nition.

”Our goals for this year are to
battle with Georgetown and

Providence, finish in the top three

again in the Big East, and to make
it to nationals,” Lear said. P

To make it to the NCAA cham-
pionship meet, the team will
have to rely mainly on strong,
consistent performances from this
year's top four runners: junior
Paul Friedrich, senior Glenn
Rhines and sophomores Keith
Dowling and Craig Woshner.

The team, however, will also
count heavily on the next three
places for depth. Lear figures that
the incoming freshmen will play
a big part in filling those places.

”We need depth, and some of
the depth will come from the
freshmen and some of the other
sophomores such as Dave Hack-
worth and Jim Hamilton,” said
Lear.

’’If this year's freshmen perform
as last year's did, we'll make it to
the nationals — period.”

Last season, Dowling and
Woshner stepped into the top
five and helped the team to its
highest placing ever at a Big East
meet, finishing 16th and 24th,
respectively.

‘ This year's recruiting class once
again brings together some of the
area's top distance runners, in-
cluding Jason Bodnar, a WPIAL
champion in the 1,600‘ and
3,200-meter run as well as cross
country at Laurel Highlands.

Other recruits are Eric Down-
er, Class AA state runner-up in

cross country at Wilkinsburg;
Steve Forrester, three—time Sec-
tion lO cross country champion
from Mercer; and Tom Swartout
from Butler, a third—p|ace winner
in the state 3,200—meter run
(AAA).

Also joining the team are trans-
fers Scott Humphries from Navy,
the 1987 Pennsylvania state
champion in the AAA
3,200—meter run, and Matt Col-
ton, from Southwest Michigan Jr.
College, the top runner for State
College's 1984 state team cham-
pionship. P .

Lear thinks that this year's team

‘ should not have too much trou-

ble surpassing the achievements

of last year.

ready to run over hill and valley

”Although we lostourtop two
finishers from the Big East meet
last year [Bob Weiner and Joe
Daniels], we have more ex-
perience than last year's team,
and that should in itself more
than compensate for the loss,’’
Lear said. J

”But, to have a truly successful
season, we will have to concen-

trate mostly on individual con- .

sistency and doing the little things
better, such as morning runs and
weight training.

’’I think that will _be the key to
the season,” he added.

Wednesday: Women's Cross
Country

 

The loss of Bob Weiner leaves a hole in the x-country roster. Coach Jim Lear
will have to depend on Paul Friedrich, Glenn Rhines, Keith Dowling and
Craig Woshner to make up for an overall lack of team depth.

ter position is All-American can-
didate Denise Frawley, whose
cannonading blasts led to 444
kills last season.

Julie Sheils, a Junior College
All-American from Syracuse,
New York is a strong candidate
to start at one of the two other
outside hitter spots. Expected to
vie with her for astarting position
upon return from a foot injury is
Kelly Matheis, Pitt's most im-
proved ‘player last season.

Dee MacAu|ay, a freshman
from Don Mills, Ontario, is an
outstanding athlete and a fine
player who Collier feels will be
a strong candidate for the outside
hitter position as well.

One of the starting middle-
blockers will be senior Nora Mul-
vihill. The other position could
go to freshman Sue Zonnerville
from Rochester, New York, who

reported in great shape and thus

far has been the surprise of train— V

ing camp.

Further competition for the
middle-blocker position will
come from a pair of talented
sophomores, Michele Adamson
and Linda Zols.

Heather Hollands, a freshman
from Scarborough, Ontario, is a
highly skilled, all-around player
who will be a key sub for the
Lady Panthers this fall. She has
the versatility to fill in at a num-
ber of positions on the court.

Collier feels that going into the
season with such a young team
is very exciting.

”We don't know what our ceil-
ing is thisjyear. We have so many
good young players this year. We
have the physical capabilities to
be better than last year, if we
gel,” he concluded.

Will Steelers version of ‘Killer B's’ be a threat?

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Brister, Blackledge, Bono —
not a group you'd be exactly in-
clined to dub ”The Killer Bs,” but
precisely what Steeler Head
Coach Chuck Noll has to work
with in ‘his search for a competent
starting quarterback.

And note the word competent.

Bubby Brister

field general Terry Bradshaw,
who started this ”B” thing, in-
filtrators with last names begin-
ning with S as in Stoudt, or W as
in Woodley, or M as in Much-

Maligned Mark Malone have at-

tempted to lead the Steelers to the
Super Bowl, or maybe on a more
reasonable scale, to respecta-
bility.

But Pittsburgh's dabbling in S
and M has proved disastrous on
the field, since the aforemen-
tioned have repeatedly failed to
accomplish their mission. So the
Pittsburgh Steelers have formally
decided to return to Basics with
Bubby, Blackledge and Bono.

A lot of talk is always made

After the legendary Pittsburgh

about the great quarterbacks who
have come out of Western Penn-
sylvania. Johnny Unitas, Joe
Montana, Joe Namath and Dan
Marino, to name a few. But there
is another section of the country
which has also bred a fine group
of QBs over the years: specifical-
ly, the great state of Louisiana.

Do the names Bert Jones and
Bobby Hebert ring a bell? How
about Joe Ferguson? Okay, how
about Terry Bradshaw?

Thought that one would ring a
bell.

Walter ”Bubby” Brister is try-
ing to squeeze his name into that
semi—elite group, as he battles for
the starting job with the Pitts-
burgh Steelers. A 6-3,
210—pounder out of Northeast
Louisiana, Brister is the leading
candidate for the position. He
originally signed a letter of intent
to play football under Paul
”Bear”Bryant at Alabama but
then opted for a short-lived career
in professional baseball.

His manager while playing for
a Detroit Tigers farm team in the
Appalachian League was none
other than Jim Leyland, current
manger of the Pittsburgh Pirates‘.

But that excursion obviously
didn't work out. Back to Loui-
siana, and now Brister is a Steel-
er, not a Buc.

He was taken in the third round
of the 1986 draft, the fifth quar-
terback selected that year.

Although his brief regular sea-
son appearances have been less
than impressive, Noll has faith in
his young quarterback.

’’I think Bubby can win the job
here," said Noll. ”He’s learned a

_ lot since he's been here. His mo-
bility opens up some options for
our offense.”

Next in line is Todd Black-
ledge, who was obtained in a

  

trade on March 29th with the
Kansas City Chiefs. The seventh
pick overall in the famed 1983
quarterback draft, Blackledge
started 24 games during his five
years in Kansas City but was un-
able to impress then head coach
John Mackovic enough to be-
come a permanent starter with
the team.

Chiefs Head Coach Frank
Gansz had seen enough in 1987,
and Blackledge hit the road back
east, whether he wanted to or
not.

It seemshe did.

”I’m happy to be back in Penn-
sylvania,” says Blackledge. ”I
grew up around this part of the
country, played college ball [at
Penn State] here. I was hoping to
be drafted by the Steelers in the
first place. I wasn't happy with
the situation in Kansas City. But
things are finally starting to work
out for me.

”I don't believe I was given a
fair opportunity to show what I
could do there,” he says. ’’If I

made a mistake, they'd pull me I

and put in Bill [Kenney, still with
the team]. Then things would go

bad for him, and I'd be back in
sooner or later. There wasn't any
consistency and it showed.”

Blackledge rejoins his father,
Ron, a seventh-year offensive line
coach with the Steelers.

Blackledge is a bulky 6-3, 225,
a great size for a NFL quarter-
back. But his mobility is question-
able, as are his medium-to-long
range passing skills. The Chiefs
had excellent wide receivers and
a wide-open offensive game plan
while Blackledge was there, and
he couldn't win the job. But he
did flourish in Joe Paterno’s high-
ly conservative offense. Maybe
NolI’s Steelers are right for what
he has to offer.

Steve Bono is your typical jour-
neyman quarterback. The
seventh-rated passer in the histo-
ry of UCLA football, Bono was

selected in the sixth round by the

Minnesota Vikings in the 1985
draft, but he played sparingly. He
was waived early in 1986, then
was resigned by Minnesota, then
waived again.

In 1987, he signed a free agent
contract with the Steelers and
was released on the final cut of
training camp. The players strike
hit in mid-September, Bono was
recalled, and has been with the
team ever since.

Each player's strengths lie in to-
tally different areas. Brister has
the cocky mentality needed to
play quarterback in the NFL. He
is highly mobile and has decent
touch; yet his abililty to complete
passes over 20 yards long is
somewhat suspect.

Blackledge has the build for the
position, as well as the smarts.
Flourishing at a top college pro-
gram like Penn State, where he

New

helped the team win a national
championship in 1982, he knows
how to play the game, no ques-
tion about it.

Blackledge is a winner, but ‘

then again, so was John Shaffer.
And look what impact he has had
onthe NFL.

Bono is the classic drop-back
passer, but he is blessed with
more mobility than Blackledge.
He throws the most accurate long

Steve Bono

ball out of the three. In his 1988
preseason debut against the
Philadelphia Eagles, he threw
touchdown passes of 66 and 56
yards. Still, he couldn't make the
Vikings or Steelers in previous
seasons; there must be something
they don't like about him.

Put all three of these guys into
a blender, hit puree, and what
you'd pour into uniform would
be the complete quarterback. Yet
certain laws of science and
morality prevent this type of
procedure.

Continued from page C-13
receive the NBA rookie mini-
mum of $150,000 if he opts to
play for the Nuggets.

Gadson was a tough lineback-
er for Pitt last season. He stayed
his four years and then tried the
NFL. After getting cut by the
Buffalo Bills, Gadson may have
found a place in Houston.

Defensive back Quintin Jones
was a second-round pick by the

Oilers after a less—than—superb

season. He is currently holding
out for more money, and the Oil-
ers don't seem to be pursuing
him. Another punch into the Pitt
athlete.

As for this coming Pitt season,
Dickerson is expected to lead the

Panther football team, with Lar-
ry Wanke ready to jump in at any
sign of trouble.

Brian Shorter would be a big
basketball name, had he not sat
out last season as a Proposition
48 player. He is unproven at best
this season and has been forgot-
ten by a lot of people.

Wrestler Pat Santoro won the
NCAA championship last year,
capping off an undefeated sea-

son. Yet, outside of college

wrestling fans, not too many peo-
ple know of him.

So, unless someone pops up
this season as an outspoken lead-
er or a statistical leader, Pitt will
be without the big name for the
first time in a while.

C-3 ‘I

Rebuilding again a primary concern for Steelers

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Here is a preseason peek at the
contributions that the 1987 Pitts-
burgh Steelers might generously
make to an armchair coach's
delight known as IBM's ”You
Make the Call.”

The Steelers are playing the
Oilers, and Chuck No/l’s troops
are faced with a crucial third-and-
seven situation at the Houston
48. Trailing 17-3, the Steelers are
in desperate need of a touch-
down to get back into the game.
A first down here is critical to the
drive. Do you run a trap play
with one of your sluggish running
backs and try to surprise the Oil-
ers, who are expecting pass? Or
do you let quarterback Mark Ma-
lone attempt a downfield pass
into the stingy Houston secon-
dary? You make the call.

If you said pass, you are cor-
rect, but remember, the other
choice would have been equally
logical. Here, Mark Malone fades
into the pocket and coolly drills
a pass that misses his open
receiver by six yards and skids
neatly off the Houston 38-yard
line. Time for the punting unit, as
the Steelers lose 20-3.

The Steelers and ‘Browns are
battling it out for a spot in the
AFC playoffs. Trailing 12-3,
coach Chuck Noll calls for more
fire and emotion out of his Steel-
ers. To spark the team, do you
make a ferocious hit on special
teams while covering a punt? Or
do you, out of nowhere, walk up

to a Cleveland offensive lineman
and nail him with a head—butt?
You make the call.

If you said head—butt the line-
man, you made the right choice.
Venting his frustration, Steeler
cornerback Delton Hall slams his
helmet, while he's still wearing
it, into the head of 6-foot-7 Cody
Risien or somebody, then is later
ejected from the game for fight-
ing. The Steelers lose a heart-
breaker, 19-13.

That's what stands out from
last year's Steeler season —— futil-
ity on the offense’s part and fire
and brimstone on the defensive
secondary’s part. But for the Pitts-
burgh Steelers — 8-7 last season,
third in the AFC Central — 1988
looks to be a lot brighter in both
areas, as well as a few others.

Gone from the team is quarter-
back Mark Malone, who was
traded to the San Diego Chargers
in the off-season. Third-year pro
Bubby Brister is the favorite to
win the position, but he's facing
a strong challenge from Todd
Blackledge, recently acquired
from Kansas City.

Blackledge is the same type of
player as former Steelers Malone
and Cliff Stoudt: big, strong, but
mild mannered, slow-of-foot and
not a great passer. Brister, well,
he has the right attitude to play
quarterback in the NFL. He's
cocky, outspoken, tough, the
kind of guy who would take on
a gang of freeway-shooting LA pit
bulls to win a football game.
”Bring it on,” he said when he
first learned that Blackledge

would be challenging him for the
job.

Question Is Brister good
enough? Are either of them good
enough to win for Pittsburgh?

The running back positions are
moving through a definite transi-
tion period. Underachiever
Walter Abercrombie is being
hard pressed to even make the
team. The coaches aren't happy
with Earnest Jackson's attitude.
And hard—working Frank Pollard,

Chuck Noll

at 31, is in limbo, unsure of
where he stands on the team. In-
juries have abruptly clouded his
future.

Second-year players Merril
Hoge and former rookie free
agent Dwight Stone will be push-
ing for a starting job. But new-

comer Warren Williams, a
sixth-round pick out of Miami
(Fla.), is the backfield’s most
pleasant surprise. He was
shadowed in college by Hurri-
cane stars Alonzo Highsmith and
Melvin Bratton, but he began to
come into his own during the
preseason. Williams could be a
starter when the Steelers open the
regular season against Dallas.

Ninth-round pick Gordie Lock-
baum, Holy Cross's celebrated
two-way player, was expected to
contribute in the same fashion as
ex-Steelers Rocky Bleier and Rich
Erenberg, but was cut.

The offensive line is in need of
consistent performances, as well
as performers. Injuries have
plagued that area of the team for
years, but Noll and his staff have
kept the unit respectable. Third-
year guard John Reinstra must
have his first good season for the
line to improve. Journeyman
tackle Buddy Aydelette has final-
ly found a home with Pittsburgh
by winning the left tackle posi-
tion, although he has since been
injured. Powerful rookies Der-
montti Dawson and Chuck Lan-
za will ultimately contribute.
Center Mike Webster, in his 15th
season, is a landmark.

Louis Lipps is once again the
class of the receivers, but he must
shake off his chronic hamstring
problems. Speedster Charles
Lockett should improve over last
season, while unimpressive Wee-
gie Thompson might be on his
way out. Rookie Mark Zeno
might have the best hands on the

squad.

Defensively, the Steelers have
one of the outstanding young
secondaries in football. Corner-
backs Delton Hall and Rod
Woodson and safeties Cornell
Gowdy and Thomas Everett are
all punishing hitters and sticky
covermen. Add in stinger Larry
Griffin , and you have some lean,
mean depth that’|| provide plenty
of footsteps to shake up opposing
receivers.

Veteran Mike Merriweather’s
holdout is ruining what could be
a fine set of linebackers. Bryan
Hinkle, David Little and the ag-
ing Robin Cole all add up to a
solid unit, one of the best in the
AFC. Watch fourth-year player
Gregg Carr step into the spotlight
soon.

The newest glaring weak spot
on the team is the defensive line,
a group that's fairly strong against
the run but put opposing quarter-
backs on their cans only 8 times
in 1987. The loss of Keith Willis
to a serious neck injury strips the
team of its best down pass rush-
er, and he only contributed 3
sacks last season. Rookie first-
round pick Aaron Jones has been
injured in camp, so the coaches
haven't seen what he can really
do. Starter Edmund Nelson was
waived outright before training
camp even started, so big things
are expected from Jones.

And Brister. And Lipps. And
Hall. And...

The Carnegie

By Mindy Boffemmyer

Showcase Editor

One of the frequently over-
looked "places to go” in Oakland
is the Carnegie Museum. It’s a
great place to visit for the first
time, but even if you’ve been
there a hundred times (starting
with that kindergarten field trip),
you might want to check out the
new exhibits scheduled for the
fall.

The Carnegie Museum of

Natural History

The permanent collection of
the Museum of Natural History
includes Polar World, Dinosaur
Hall, Hillman Hall of Minerals
and Gems and Wyckoff Hall of
Arctic Life.

Anyone living in Oakland dur-
ing this past summer couldn't
possibly have escaped the public-
ity promoting the Dinosaurs Alive
exhibition. The exhibit consists of
six robotic dinosaurs displayed in
a setting that resembles their
natural habitat. Dinosaurs Alive,
running through September 25 i

a long time.

Another exhibition, X—Rays of
the Carnegie Mummies, will be
on display through December 31.
In order to provide information
about the mummification
process, 26 animal and 4 human
mummies were x-rayed. And

 
 
  
  

everyone who has been disap-
pointed by the absence of the
mummies and other assorted
Egyptian paraphernalia will be
glad to know that renovations are
being completed. Egyptian Hall
will open in the fall or next year,
complete with a recreation of an
Egyptian tomb.

One of the most exciting of the
Carnegie’s coming attractions is
the Benedum Hall of Geology,
featuring a ”sratovator," which
simulates an elevator descending
through thousands of lay
rock.

Spotlight on
Pitt Actors

Bouvy and Bannon break a leg

 

 

Harry Bouvy and Anne Louise Bannon are two of many promising young actors in the

university theater department.

By Mindy Boffemmyer

Showcase Editor

Harry.Bouvy is probably best
known on the Pitt Theatre scene
for his portrayal of Alceste in the
Pitt mainstage production of The

. l\7li7san”thrope. '

. Alceste is a very complicated

character, and‘ Harry was ”ner-
vous about taking it on.

”The director wanted me to
play a man in his thirties. I think
Alceste finally came across as be-
ing, maybe, in his late twenties.”

Another difficult aspect of the

Q play for Harry was that The Mis-
anthrope is written entirely in
verse.

”One of the turning points in
the play was when I came on-
stage with a letter to one of Celi-
mene’s (Anne Louise Bannon)

suitors. One day I came on

without the letter. Anne Louise
and I handled it well, though.
When she realized that! had for-
gotten it, she just cut, in her
mind, all of the lines pertaining
to the letter.’’

Harry, ‘now a senior acting
major at Pitt, has known since
high school that he wanted to
pursue theater as a career, but he
isn't sure yet which aspect of the
theater interests him most.

”I’m not sure whether I want to *

pursue acting professionally, or
directing or teaching. Teaching is
sort of the best of all three worlds.
On the college level you can act,
direct and teach.

”I like to do musicals, too, but

. I guess my main interest is in

directing.”
I Harry's directing experience in-

cludes Cinderella and Little Shop
of Horrors, both performed at his
former high school. .

”By the time I got into my
senior year in high school, I was
able to direct Cinderella for a
children's show that we did each
yeah

"I just got done directing Little
Shop of Horrors at my old high
school. That was my biggest
project. I went nuts. The music
was difficult, and I had to decide
whether they were up to it. They
were. In the end, they really
came through for me.”

Harry has been busy this sum-
mer with the Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival, playing Bi-
ondello in The Taming of the
Shrew, Commendatore in Vol-
pone and Artemidorus in Julius
Caesar.

’’It was difficult, but it was a
good experience. We worked ev-
ery day, all day. It taught me a lot
about working with professionals
and about the business itself.”

He feels that he's learned a
great deal about professionalism
through his own experience as a
director. . .

’’I’m always at least 15 minutes
early.-Being a director, I know
what it's like. I expect people to
be there when I call a rehearsal.”

Harry played Melchior in
Spring Awakening, which was
directed by Peter Harrington and
presented in the Studio Theatre.

It was a very challenging role,
and it took a lot of hard work. But
Peter Harrington was a lot of
help.” ,

His favorite role was Doody in
Crease, which ”is also known as
’the play from hell’ in the Pitt
Theater Department” because of
a few bizarre problems encoun-
tered during its production.

”I, personally, chipped my
teeth with a hubcap that I was
carrying for that show.” -

Harry has been living with his
”very supportive” family in South
Park for the past four years while
he commuted to Pitt.

”They’re a little concerned
with what I'm going to do with
it. Professional theater is very
risky. I know that. That's why I’m

 

considering teaching.

’’I guess I get most of my want-
ing to show off from my father.
He likes to show off.

”It’s amazing whenever any-
one in my family comes to see
one of the plays, they always ask,
’how do you remember all of
those lines?’, which is actually
the easiest part.”

Dancing lessons at the age of
three were Anne Louise Bannon’s
introduction to the stage, and she
has been very dedicated to learn-
ing the art of performance ever
since then.

With a long list of perfor-
mances to her credit,
Louise is one of Pitt Theatre's
most impressive actresses. Her
roles have varied greatly to in-
clude Celimene in The Misan-
thrope, Abigail in The Crucible
and Bianca in the Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival's produc-
tion of The‘Taming of the Shrew.

She considers therrole of Dr.
Anders, in Back to Beulah, to
have been the most challenging.

After obtaining her bachelor's I
degree in acting at the Universi-‘“

ty of Windsor, Anne Louise
decided to leave her hometown,
Windsor, Ontario, to earn her

M.F.A. in ”th€' states.” I ‘

Contrary to what many believe,
there is more to Oakland than the
three blocks along Fifth and
Forbes commonly known as
”campus” to Pitt students. Past
the Cathedral, past Heinz Chapel
and even past the Music Building
runs a street perpendicular to the
two great speedways of Oakland.
South Craig Street isn't far, but for
many, it lies beyond the beaten
path.

Walk only three blocks toward
CMU on Fifth or Forbes and you
will find a collection of shopsand

restaurants that are unique and

diverse. There are restaurants
specializing in Indian, Mid-
eastern, American and French
cuisine as well as comic book,
clothing and ice cream stores.

Phantom of the Attic carries
graphic novels, t-shirts, games
and indie-hardcore CD5. The

store opened in 1983 when own-
er Jim Weston realized that Pitts-
burgh had only one comic book
store. Since 1983, the operation
has expanded to include five
stores in the Pittsburgh area and
a warehouse where ‘/2 million
units of comics are stored.

Phantom of the Attic special-
izes in new as well as collectable
comics. Each Friday new comics
are delivered and customers can
choose a subscription service if
they so desire. Special orders are
also handled. Phantom also car-
ries quite a few golden—age
(l930s—40s) and silver-age
(I940s—50s) comics. Their most
valuable comic book is Thun’da
the only book that fantasy artist
Frank Frazetta illustrated in it's
entirety.

The bestsellers at Phantom of
the Attic are The X—men from
Marvel Comics and The Amazing
Spiderman according to‘ store
manager Jeff Yandora.

”Superhero comics are what's
been in vogue for the last 25
years,” he said. ”Funny animal
comics like Disney also sell
well.”

Yandora is confident that Phan-

tom of the Attic will continue its
expansion. ”We deal with a wide
variety of customers. Comics are
on an upswing in sales national-
|y,” he said.

The Pogues strikeit rich with 25 to one odds

the two parts is itself a triumphant .~

by Joel Timulak

Assistant Showcase Editor

When the Pogues formed five
years ago, they were called
Pogue Mahone, which means
”kiss my arse” in Gaelic. With
the release of their fourth record,
this one produced by Steve
Lillywhite, the traditional Ir-
ish/punk band announce that
they are still ”pogue mahone" in
spirit. '

The Pogues come from North
London, the mostly-lrish industri-
al sewer where the old men, the
unemployed and the thirsty drink
all night in Victorian pubs called
”Buddy - Mulligan” ‘ and ”The
Crown” to the tune of traditional
Irish music. Shane’ MacGowan's
mum used to sing in these
groups, so he considers the mus-
ic and the tradition in his blood.

In 1983, MacGowan was in a
punk group called the Nipple
Erectors when he met a banjo
player named Jem Finer. The two
decided to try playing some Irish

~ music in the pubs and soon dis-

covered that it was more fun than
playing in a guitar band for Lon-
don's punks.

The two collected Spider
Stacey, a tin—whistle player, Andy
Rankin, a drummer, James Fearn—
ley, an accordionist, and Caitlin
O’Riordin, a bass player and,
with all the energy of the punk
explosion, played some of the
wildest music to come from any
neighborhood with any instru-
ments in a long time. Maybe

even ten years.

In 1984, the group recorded an
album including a song by Irish
playwright/drink-casualty Bren-
dan Behan, a handful of tradition-
al Irish jigs and reels, and original
stompers about the lower-class
graveyard where they lived and
played.

The resulting LP, Red Roses For
Me, ‘succeeded instantly.
Released on Stiff Records, the
Pogues got college airplay in the
states and began to take their gin-
and-adrenalin—soaked show on
the road. The record got great
reviews by the press (”The future
of rock and roll,’' saidone writer)
and thrived on the singles ”Trans-
metropo|itan” and ”Boys From
the Country Hell.”

The energy of the band aside,
the Pogues’ songs were actually
great. After all, rock and roll’s

roots aren't only in negro blues; ,

they're in British music, too. The
fast melodies and 6/8 rhythm are
instantly accessible and emotion-
ally affecting. And Shane MacGo—
wan, who considers himself one
in the long line of great drunken
writers, writes some pretty crafty
lyrics.

The song ”Boys From the
Country Hell" is the perfect por-
trait of lower-class British youth.
On the surface, the song is about
a guy who works ' for ”the
meanest, bastard you have ever
seen,” for whom ”to lose a sin-
gle penny would grieve him aw-
ful sore.”

The guy gathers up his friends,

beats the life out of the bastard,
and together the boys rove the
country doing the devil's work.
Underneath, the lyrics portray a
kid who leaves his penny-
pinching boss in an alley without
a penny himself. He's left with
nothing to do but drink and fight.
Shane's lines ”lend me ten
pounds and I'll buy you a drink”
and ”when you haven't got a
penny, boys, it's all the bloody
same" are an '80s update of. lag-
ger's "Street Fighting Man” cho-
rus,"what can a poor boy do but
play in a rock and roll band."
But while things haven't im-
proved any for British youth as a
whole in the past 20 years, Shane
MacGowan’s situation began to
pick up when Elvis Costello
heard Red. Roses For Me. Costel-
lo took the gray-skinned and bad-
teethed band in the studio to

subsequent four-song EP.

This band featured two new
members: Philip Chevron on gui-
tars and Terry Woods on mando-
lin, cittern and bouzouki.

Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash
was produced as sparsely as the
first record, but the eleven songs
were a bit more varied, and a few
featured Uillean pipes. This time
out, MacGowan’s artlessvoice
was higher in the mix and stood
as the only testament to the
band's ugly surroundings, as the
music was always beautiful.

The record yielded two great
singles. "Dirty Old Town” is sort
of a country number with acous-

produce a second album and a‘

tic guitar, fiddle and pipes which
at once” reminisces about love
scenes by the gasworks wall and
vows vengeance against the
squalor of the town's filthy, dead
factories.

"A Pair of Brown Eyes,” which
appeared on MTV, is another
great MacGowan song about
dreams and desperation. On the
surface, the tune is pretty and
melancholy, but a look at the lyr-
ics reveals a terrifying story of
’’blood and death ’neath the
screaming sky” and a haunting,
alcoholic vision/memory of an
angelic pair of brown eyes.

As with the best drunken
writers, MacGowan's songs are
unpretentious and folksy but rev-
eal a deep level of sadness, anger
and broken dreams. An interest-
ing, knowledgeable, literate guy,
he shouldn't be written off as a
drunken rocker who fantasizes
about brutalizing the landed gen-
try and burning or chopping Lon-
don to the ground.

Two years after the 1986 EP
Poguetry in Motion and extensive
touring, the Pogues re-emerged
this year with If I Should Fall
From Grace With God. This is a
landmark record. Not only is,it a
masterpiece of writing, perform-
ing and recording, it is one of the
rare times that a great indie band
goes into the studio with a big-
time producer and ends up bet-
ter for it. The eight—piece Pogues,
with Daryl Hunt replacing Cait
O’Riordin who left and married
Elvis Costello, sound fuller and
tighter and yet as rowdy and
energetic as ever. .

The album blasts right off with
three rousing tunes in the style
they're famous for. Most notable
is ”Bottle of Smoke,” a fast song
about a gambling family man
who wins big on a horse with 25-
to-1 odds. Shane MacGowan
shouts this Irish version of win-
ning the lottery to a rambling
drum beat which‘ gives way to a

tight, minor-moded instrumental '

section. The transition between

rush.

A recent reviewer wrote that "if
the Clash were into Irish music
instead of reggae, they would get
up every moring and try to write
"Bottle of Smoke.”

Then the record takes a turn for
the unexplored. The next four
songs are more complicated

pieces which, while taking full T,
advantage of a large, modern stu- 

dio, are adventurous in their var-

iety of writing styles and

intra-song diversity. Witness the,
Pogues go from ballad to reel to

metropolitan, carhorn-blowing

boogie to jig to Mexican polka.

You never forget that you're

listening to a Pogues record, but

you're amazed at theirlnew ver-

satility.

”Fairytale of New York," the
sincerest of MacGowan’s broken
dreams songs, and ”Thousands
Are Sailing" are both about the
failure of the immigrant’s vision
of America.

The lyrics are less provocative

A than some, but the music is some

of the most beautiful ever made,
especially ”Thousands,” whose
chorus is perfectly haunting, not
only because of the accompany-
ing vocals and music, and whose
instrumental passage is the most
awe-inspiring moment on any
Pogues album. In between the
two songs is "Metropolis," which
may be the best—ever Pogues in-
strumental.

Next is ”Fiesta," the second
single after the title track. This
hilarious tune about a ”crazy
gringo” at a fiesta at Almeria is a
complete diversion for the
Pogues,.as,it is. not about anvthing
that MacGowan has written
about before, i.e. pirates, ghosts,
drunken brawling heroes and the
horrible injustices of being Irish
in England (as inthe next two

The stately white building on
Craft Avenue in Oakland will
mark its 53rd anniversary as a
theater. After the hundreds of
plays and movies that have been
showcased there, the Pittsburgh
Playhouse has been entertaining
the community since 1934.

Since its founding over a half-
century ago, the Playhouse has
operated as a community, semi-
professional, professional reper-
tory and college theater”. The
premiere performance was the
comedy Art and Mrs. Bottle,
staged at the Frick School audito-
rium in Oakland.

In the mid—l930s, ‘tickets to a
performance cost one dollar. The
time after World War II found the
Playhouse in a period of expan-
sion. Attendance to the shows
was always near capacity. By the
early T9605, the Playhouse had
added a restaurant and a chil-
dren's theater. After some restruc-
turing later that decade, the
Playhouse was operated under
the auspices of Point Park College
and remains so today.

The Playhouse now houses
several different theater groups.
The Theatre Company, the com-
pany of theater professionals both
local and national, will present
the Cole Porter musical Anything
Goes from Oct. 25 to Nov. 20.
' The Playhouse Junior, com-
posed of student actors from
Point Park College who are
professionally directed, will per-
form the classic fairy tale Robin
Hood, which runs from Oct. 8 to
Nov. 20.

The Point Park CoIIege'Th'eat're
Company will showcase the Don
DeLil|o story, The Day Room, a
play about character identity, dur-
ing the first two weeks in Novem-
ber. The Playhouse Dance
theater, composed of student and
guest artists as performers and
choreographers, will present a
dance, to be announced.

In addition to the many theat-
ercompanies of the Playhouse,
the building itself contains many
stages. The I13-seat Hamlet
Theatre is home to the Playhouse
Junior and also doubles as a
movie theater in the off season.

The grand 474-seat Rockwell

Theatre serves the Theatre Com— V

pany. The Theatre Downstairs, a
”black box” that seats 90, is the
stage for the Point Park College
Theatre Company. This small
theater is a flexible open set
which can be arranged in a three-
quarters or percenium stage.

The Playhouse is under the
direction of James O. Prescott,
who is also the chairman of the
theater department at Point Park
College.

Richard Rauh takes care of the
other leg of the Playhouse, the
film repertoire. Open 364 nights
of the year (it's closed only Christ-
mas Eve), with a different film
each night, the Playhouse offers
a wide sampling of classic movies
as well as presenting first—run
films.

In September, the theater will
be the host of six Pittsburgh
premiere films. Running from
Aug. 28 through Sept. 8 is Jodie
Foster in Five Corners, a film writ-
ten by John Patrick Shanley, the
author of this spring’s hit Moon--
struck. The story is the tale of
how several lives Intertwine for
one day.

Mickey Rourke... drunken poet or poetic drunk?  

. by Joel Timulak

Assistant Showcase Editor

~’~’| can't stand people. I hate
them. Don't you hate them?” the
woman at the bar asks the beat-
up drunk. ”No, I don't hate
them,” he replies, ’’I just seem to
feel better when they're not
around.” Thus begins the love af-
fair between two barflies.
Bart/y is the culmination ot a
seven-year project or noted
French director Barbet Schroed-
er to bring the writing of Charles
Bukowski to the screen. After dis-
covering Bukowski, Schroeder
proceeded to read the Californi-

-an’s complete tatalog of fiction

and poetry. Schroeder not only
deemed him the greatest living
American writer, in a league with
Faulkner et al, but also virtually
untranslatable to film.

BARF LY

Schroeder decided to commis-
sion Bukowski to write a screen-
play. The 68-year old chronicler
of American lowlife, however,
was a hard sell. Bukowski hates
film and has never even consi-
dered writingla script.

Once convinced, however,
Bukowski penned a brilliant,
mostly autobiographical story of
a young drunken poet (or, poetic
drunk) with a death wish.

Henry Chinaski, wonderfully

to drink and drinks to escape.
He's terrified of the stifling 9-to-5
jobs that average society mem-
bers detests but are afraid to lose.
He's terrified of the endless pay-
ments and domestic strife. In his
hiding, he writes poetry and sto-
ries in cheap rooms in order to
preserve his uniqueness among
the maddening and frightening
society. ”Most people never go
crazy," he writes. ”What horrible
lives they must live."

Ele also rights. He regulariv
provokes the real-man night bar-
It-noer lgddie niayed by Slv'<
:,rotner. Frank Stallone. The two
head out into the alley of The
(golden Horn. followed by a mot-
ley crew of regulars. where they.
the weight—lifting ladies’ men and
the wise—mouthed bum, beat
each other’s brains against the
downtown L.A. alley bricks.

Bukowski explains that Henry
is somewhat suicidal. He gets
himself into fights and angers
sadists as a .tentative method of
dying without using his own
hands. Bukowski adds that the
film is actually a story of a few
days in his life at age 25. "Ninety-
five percent of what happens in
the film happened to me.”

Things begin to look up for
Henry's will to live when he
meets Wanda Wilcox, played by
screen goddess Faye Dunaway.
The two, used to resisting and
repelling love, can't resist each
other, as they have the common
bond of the bottle. Wanda is
more desperate and more of a
drinker than Henry; she drinks
because there is nothing else left.

Faye Dunnaway and Mickey Rourke hang on director Babet Shroeder’s every word.

Once a classy lady, Wanda still
wears dressy outfits and expen-
sive shoes of a slightly outdated
fashion.

Henry falls in love with this
”stressed goddess” and she with
him, but the two discover that
they have to pay bills and go
through the normal heartaches of
a relationship, the two things they
so adamantly avoid.

When the love goes on the
rocks, Henry the writer gets dis-
covered.‘ Henry had sent some
stories to Tully Sorenson, an over-
educated publisher, who says his
stories made her feel. And they
made her curious. She has to hire
a private detective to track down
the nomadic drunk, and when

she does, she offers him peace,

money and a small house, one .

next to hers.

Henry, after spending one
night, can't stand the thin air of
the ”cage with golden bars. No
one who could write worth a
damn could write in peace,” he
tells the disillusioned Tully.

‘Money, on the other hand, is
quite useful to a dangerous
drunk. Henry and his friends will
drink in style at the Golden Horn
as things appear not to have
changed. As the barflies follow
Henry and Eddie into the alley
this time, however, something is
different.

Barfly is eclectically filmed and
well acted. The soundtrack of

Booker T and Mozart is a plus. it
could become a cult film, though
it's not as shocking as a David
Lynch or Stanley Kubrick film. It
doesn't aspire to be shocking,
although the sight of Hollywood
hero Mickey Rourke as a black-
eyed overweight bum may set/
some viewers off center. You can
practically smell him on the
screen.

‘ Barfly is the sweet/sickening
stench of the poor and the losers.
It is the compost of a Christian-
American garden. It is the brilli-
ant sewage of a big, big country,
and it is wonderful. See it at the
Fulton at 6th and Penn from Aug.
26 to Sept. 1st.

Joining the masses of secret cult film freaks

By Scot Ross
Contributing Editor

5 ln Oakland, there are a variety
of locations where one can see
the latest movies of the day. Your
basic Cocktail with Tom Cruise
and your routine Crocodile Dun-
dee and, of course, any of the
latest Steven Spielberg projects
can be seen at a myriad of
cinematic locales. .

However, with all of the new
movies that have been released,
there are still a few old movies to
yearn for. Perhaps ’’old’’ is a poor
term to use. I'm not talking about
the basic American Movie Clas-
sics’ Moon Over Miami featuring
Betty Crable, or Jimmy Stewart
and Donna Reed in the Capra

classic /t’s A Wonderful Life.
No, I am referring to the types
of movies where, if you like it,
you've seen it five or six times.
I’m talking about that breed of
movie that evokes the best in a
movie crowd. . The brand of
movie that catches the audience
up in the action, where cinema
patrons find themselves speaking
the words in turn as they churn
out from the screen. I am speak-
ing of some of the worst movies,
and I'm speaking of some of the
best movies ever made. I'm
speaking about the cult movies.
And if, while in Oakland, you
see these films scheduled to play
at either David Lawrence or on
the Hill, or wherever, I suggest

you see them. They're entertain-
ing and you may laugh.

The first of the films on the list
is The Big Chill, perhaps the most
commercially successful of the
films I will be mentioning.

The story deals with seven
friends who get together after the
suicide of a college chum. (I
know you purists realize I didn't
include Meg Tilly's character, but
she technically wasn't a friend
when they reconvened at the
wake.)

While watching the movie, I
got the overwhelming feeling that
the writers perused over every
line of dialogue. It seems like the
actors say just the right things for
their characters, from Michael's
”everyone does everything to get
laid” to Nick's admittance ’’I hate
my life.”

The next movie I've listed is
Blue Velvet. The movie is a sur-
realistic voyage into a utopian
suburbia. The conflict arises as
this world collides with a seedy,
underworld that lies one street
down.

Dennis Hopper is wonderful as
the monster Frank Booth, a twist-
ed caricature of the evil in the
world today. Director David
Lynchwas nominated for an O5-
car for his brilliant effort.

The film combines tingling sus-

pense, graphic emotional turmoil

‘ and just the right amount of dark

humor to captivate the audience.
It one of those rare films that you
absolutely abhor or are mesmer-
ized by.

l972l’s Fritz the Catis Ralph
Bakshi’s slickly animated version
of Robert Crumb’s underground
comic character. Laugh and en-
joy Fritz as he travels through the
lifestyle of the '60s.

One of the noteworthy accom-
plishments of the movie is its in-
famous classification as the first
X—rated cartoon.

Harry Dean Stanton plays the
car repossessor and Emilio Este-
vez is the punker he takes under
his wing in Repo Man.

The film is packed with social
innuendos as well as a fair
amount of science fiction. It also
features the punk group The Cir-
cle Jerks.

The Rocky Horror Picture
Show. The perennial cult film of
all time. It is a majestic romp into
the world of the transvestite from
transsexual Transylvania and his
kingdom.

It features an exciting sound-
track, including the anthem
”Time Warp.” What else but a
cult film could this project be, in
which the audience tosses hot
dogs, toilet paper and is invited

to call the female lead a slut?

Many of the films referred to as
cult fall into the horror genre of
movie making. The final three
films I've listed are of this mode.

The first must be George
Romero's Night of the Living
Dead. This low budget 1968
production features seven terro-
rized villagers penned up in a
house, attempting to escape the
wrath of flesh-eating zombies.

The second on my pen-and—ink
list is the made-for—TV movie Tril-
ogy of Terror. It features 705 god-
dess Karen Black in three fiendish
films, the most terrorizing of all
being Prey, where Black is con-
fonted by a horrible voodoo doll
which comes to life equipped
with a sharp knife and a
vengeance.

The final chapter in my trio of
mirth is Bad Ronald, in which a
family moves into a house, una-
ware that a confused boy who ac-
cidently murdered a young girl is
hiding within the framework.

These movies are perhaps not
the best that Hollywood has
offered us; however, what they
do is captivate and intrigue us.
Hate or love them, these movies
make us wonder about the
characters. And hell, isn't that
what movies are supposed to do?

Cleaning

By Manny Theiner
Staff Writer

Pittsburgh has its fill of seedy
clubs and packed theaters. But
where do people go if they want
some alternative entertainment
that's intellectually stimulating
and free of commercial trap-
pings? Such places were once
few and far between and never
seemed to last long in this brain-
dead town. But now, Pittsburgh
has the Foundry.

Until June, the large warehouse
at 2930 Penn Avenue in the Strip
District was actually a foundry,
hence the name. After three years
of working with performance
spaces in Los Angeles, John Tara-
si returned home to open a simi-
lar space here, and the Foundry
was born.

lt’s not just a club or a gallery.
The idea is to combine every art
form — music. art, photography,
film, theater and dance — into the
same space and to get the au-
dience involved a(‘(‘(>rcI:t<2 to
Tarasi. ”We’re offering a cultur-
 iortlm, .5 worklmé sltlolo wnere
E3361 .1.-"lists. «. an. i:~e‘- v‘'»" ' S

out the scrap metal in the Foundry

press themselves. An artist who
is restrained elsewhere can work
freely here; they can put their
work on the wall, on a piece of
steel or on the ceiling.”

The space is not supervised by
wealthy patrons of the arts coun-
ciland is not for commercial
gain. Rather, it's controlled by ar-
tists for artists. The person that
shows his artwork may be the
guy at the door when a band is
playing.

Tarasi doesn't feel that the
Foundry needs formal advertis-
ing; word of mouth is probably
enough to attract interested peo-
ple to a unique place like this.
”Katie MacLaine from the cast of
Street Law stopped here during
their filming in Pittsburgh” She
said she'd never seen anything
like this in New York.”

Another advantage for the
Foundry is that the owner of the
building, Ron Dalbello of Man-
hattan. is supportive of the artis-
tic events. Various local
.:usinesses donate their time to
vii) fix up the place, such as
is who. b‘r\/ant or Carnegie Tar and

-.’!\(*' "I\Il|Vy"‘i(:5"(\f‘f’ Ola?‘

floor.

Earlv happenings at the Foun-
dry bode well for its survival.
There have been concerts with
local bands Thin White Line and
SDI, a slide show with Chris Con-
nolly of WQEX and several local
artists working there, including
Sidney Parrish, who works with
nail sculpture (you'll have to see
it for yourself!). Alternative radio
favorites Scrawl and Happy Flow-

ers will be playing at the Foun-
dry on September 23. Curious
souls are encouraged to drop by
weekdays and evenings to talk
with the artists about their craft.

Tarasi has plans for improve-
ments in the near future.”l want
to make it a coffeehouse where
people can discuss the issues of
the day in an atmosphere of free
expression. With a little extra
paint and lighting  hopefully it

can become a cultural mecca for
the city of Pittsburgh.”

It's not a chore traveling to the
Foundry, either. The 54C bus
brings you from Oakland right to
the corner of 30th and Penn. So,
next time you hear about an
event at the Foundry, don’t hesi-
tate to check it out. lt’s easy to
find — there are cows on the
front.

THEAFFORDABLEFLOORS

Drumming their way out of the basement

By William Young
Managing Editor

The AffordableF|oors have
been Pittsburgh's premier
progressive original music band
since they won the Tri-State Rock
Competition in 1986. This,
however, hasr.’t managed to
catapult the band tofame and for-
tune, but it has gotten them gigs
in Cleveland.

The Floors started out in 1980
with Kirk Botula and Harvey Cob-
lin both playing synthesizers and
another keyboard player and a
drummer’ that they would hire
whenever they needed them.
Their name came more by acci-
dent than by intention, and it has
stuck with them since.

“Back in 1980, Harvey and our
other keyboard player and I were
were driving down Banksville
Road and we were talking about
names,” Botula recalled, "and
someone said, ‘Hey, let's call our-
selves the Affordable Floors’ be-
cause we saw this building with
this sign on it — Affordable
Floors.

“Everyone just sort of said ‘Ha,
ha, funny name.’ So we kept us-
ing that name and started playing
more and more and then realized
that we needed to come up with
a real name, so we made up a list
of names. But by then it was too
late to change it because every-
one knew us and we had put
things out on vinyl, so we just
kept it."

The music the Floors play has
changed a lot since the early days
of Botula and Coblin. Botula says
that they used to V do movie
soundtracks for local movies and
play at parties.

"Back in the Spring of '81, Har-
vey and I did mostly film sound-
tracks,” Botula said. "We played
around parties and did a couple
of art gallery openings, things like ’
that. We usually played, like, one
song forabout an hour that had
about six notes in it."

Botula said that attempts at
playing a ‘‘real’' show were more
spur—of—the—moment operations
than anything else.

"Harvey and I would get a
band together, learn nine songs
and just go do it."

The Floors didn't turn into a
real band until the Fall of 1985,

Smile.

 

when Ken Zenkevich and Steve
Morrison joined the band,
although Botula says that he,
Coblin and bassist Eric Riebling
had played the Electric Banana
earlier that year. The Floors were
just nolonger content with doing
movie soundtracks and art
galleries.

. ”The soundtracks and all were
a lot of fun, but it's not exactly
like rock ’n' roll,” Botula said. “I
was in art school at the time and
was getting pretty dissatisfied
with it and wanted something
more creative to do. Harvey and
I just got tired of sitting in a base-
ment with some keyboards and a
tape machine.

"The biggest problem we had
when trying to get a real band
together was finding a guitarist,”
Botula said. "Most of the people
that auditioned were ‘guitar
heros' and not guitar players.

”One night, I went out and saw
a local band that was pretty big

_ back then called The Party, and

I said to myself, ‘That guy is great.

He's perfect for what we want to
do.’ That was Steve Morrison.
"It turned out that The Party
was breaking up at the end of that
summer so Steve was willing to
join us, but it took a while to get
Ken (Zenkevich, then drummer
for The Party) to join. Right then,
our drummer decided to move to
Italy; we talked to Ken, but he
didn't really want to do it because

‘he had to go to school in the fall

and he just wasn't interested,”
Botula said.

“After a while, though,” Botu-
la continued, "he heard some of
our stuff and decided to join."

Morrison only remained with
the band for two years. He left

last fall to form a new band called

Fusebox, so the Floors were back
on the market for a guitarist.
"Steve's natural inclination is
toward British style pop like XTC
and Squeeze, while I like the
style of Kate Bush more," Botula
said of their musical differences.
"It took us a long time to find

‘a new guitarist because we wer-

en‘t just going‘ to fill his (Morri-
son's) shoes,” Botula said. “Steve
added a lot to the band and we
wanted someone else that would
add their influence to us. Steve
and I were educated by each
other in that sense.”

After four months of audition-
ing, they finally found what they
needed in the talents of Eric Her-
zog, a guitar player who Botula
says has a more experimental
sound than Morrison.

Since then, the Floors have
been expanding their influence to
areas outside of Pittsburgh. As
Botula puts it, their influence is
basically to go "wherever we can
drive to in a day” —- Cleveland.

"It's a lot of fun, but the scene
is really bad. There's very little
support for the bands, even the
top bands only draw 200 people
to a show. Our last show at the
Graffiti drew between 900 and
1,000 people," Botula said. “It's

very underground there  a
much smaller scale. Things are
competitive up there.”

The noise the Floors have been
making has drawn the attention
of major labels, but mostly in the
form of encouragement.

”The general response is a
number [of labels] are aware of
what we're doing,” Botula said.
“A number say we're- not quite
pop enough, that we don't have
any singles. They're looking for
a crossover sound that could go
over on Top 40. They're taking
the attitude ‘we'll watch, but if
anybody else seems interested,
come and tell us.’ ” V,

WPTS: Wonderful Party Tracks all Semester long

By Joel Timulak

Assistant Showcase Editor

WPTS, the Pitt radio station, is
now entering her fourth year of
broadcasting a desperately need-
ed alternative to the stifling for-
mat of Pittsburgh FM.

Training Director George Nix-
on explains that they used to refer
to themselves as a ”new music"
station. ”Now we use the term
‘progressive.’ It seems to be one
of the few constants in the cons-
tantly changing trends in the mus-
ic we play."

”—

It is not unusual to
hear Ice-T and Birthday
Party on the same
show.

— George Nixon
—
I I

College radio across the coun-
try, he further explained, is divid-
ed into two camps: the formatted
and the freeform. ”We try to walk
the line with a loose format
which allows Dls to design their
own shows." WPTS Dls can play
their personal favorites and ex-

pose an audience to a wide vari-
ety of music. ’’It is not
uncommon to hear lce—T and The
Birthday Party on the same
show,” he said.

”We try not to take ourselves
too seriously. We just play mus-
ic: the kind you can't hear any-
where else.”

WPTS is also committed to giv-
ing local bands much needed ex-
posure. For four years WPTS has
supported original locals such as
l lth Hour, The Garden, The
Heretics and The Affordable
Floors and has firmly established
itself as the premier promoter of
Pittsburgh music.

The station is not only a great
serxice to radio listeners and in-
dependent bands, it is also a
pi ime opportunity for experience
in broadcasting. As the station is
student managed and operated,
the WPTS crowd gets down to
business and has fun together.
George Nixon adds, ”Working at
WPTS provides students with an
alternative to the shot-and-a-beer
social scene.

The WPTS open house is today
at 1:30, at the station on the
fourth floor of the William Pitt
Union. Interested students should
also check out the WPTS booth
at the Activities Fair, or they
could just pay a visit.

WYEP maintaining a healthy
audience with diverse format

By Mark R. Brown

Contributing Editor

WYEP continues to fill the air-
waves with its alternative and
varied broadcasts. Originally a
community access radio station
which operated from a storefront
in south Oakland, WYEP featured
lots of reggae and public interest
topics. WYEP has continued to
fine tune its programming to meet
its listeners’ interests.

Doug Bostrom, WYEP’s gener-
al manager is pleased with the
evolution of his station. ”Our
growth has been very satisfacto-
ry. We've attracted many new
listeners, and many of our old
listeners from previous incarna-
tions have returned," said
Bostrom.

WYEP is broadcasting a bit
more jazz than it was when it
came back on the air last Septem-
ber. After two sessions of rear-

ranging their programming
format, some changes were
made, although their most popu-
lar block, Night Shades, has re-
mained essentially the same.
”The future holds no major
changes for WYEP," said Bos-

”—

The absence of
WXXP and its impact
on the listeners is
worth looking into.

— Doug Bostrom
—
ll

trom, ”however, the absence of
WXXP and its impact on the
listeners is worth looking into.”

WYEP broadcasts on 91.3 FM,
with its offices in Squirrel Hill.
They will be having a new-

listener drive from Oct. 1 to the
14th.

WYEP’s programming is as
follows:

06 a.m. to 10 a.m. is /azz &
Things, which features tradition-
al jazz.

Ol0 a.m. to 2 p.m. is Ameri-
can Sampler, which is mostly folk
music.

02 p.m. to 4 p.m. is Airwaves,
a mixture of public affairs and arts
information.

04 p.m. to 8 p.m. is Contem-
porary jazz.

08 p.m. to midnight is Night-
shades, eclectic sweet things
such as space music and progres-
sive jazz.

OMidnight to 6 a.m. is Modern

Times, a variety of world music,
avant jazz and new music.

negie Mellon University. While
other stations play only one type
of music at any given time of the
day, WRCT offers a wide variety
of music at all times.

The free format of WRCT me-
ans that the DJs themselves
choose the music to be played
during their time slot; there are
no authoritarian programmers or
advisors looking over their shoul-
ders. Just selecting the music can
be an exhilarating experience,
since the DJ has over 400 new
releases and a library of over
60,000 records and cassettes at
his or her disposal — the largest
collection of music in Pittsburgh.

Some DJs prefer to concentrate
on a certain musical genre, but
there are no requirements to do
so. ’’If someone wants to play
Metallica in the middle of a reg-
gae show, that's fine,” says
Robert Pleshar, production
director.

Diversity is the name of the
game at WRCT, with emphasis
on music rarely heard elsewhere
in ‘Pittsburgh. The list is almost
endless: rock, jazz, reggae, ex-
perimental, country, hardcore,
folk, industrial, dance, new age,
blues, rap, African, electronic and
classical are but a few of the al-
ternative sounds served up
regularly. .

’’I think the majority of the
listeners enjoy the variety, the
freedom to move from one type
of music to another without wor-
rying about block programming,”
comments George Gee, a 10-year

veteran of the station.

Gee, who leads the Make-
Believe Ballroom Orchestra, also
gives WRCT credit for his suc-
cess. ”Even the big band swing
is an alternative to commercial
music, and WRCT has been very
supportive of us.”

indeed, WRCT makes a special
effort to promote local artists of
all genres by playing their music
constantly, not just one hour a

involved two CMU people and
composer Jason Gibbs, who has
done summer airshifts since
1983. Says Gibbs, ”We were
brought together by a common
interest in experimental music.”

”—

If someone wants to
play Metallica in the
middle of a raggae
show, that fine.

— Robert Pleshar

The promotion of alternative
music extends naturally to the
varied concerts WRCT has
presented in the past few months,
from Mutabaruka to Sun Ra to co-
presentations with .WPTS like
Hunting Lodge and the Pixies.
The station's al|—volunteer staff
urges listeners to attend shows
because they enjoy the music.
There are plenty of record and
ticket giveaways, but without the
hype and gimmickry of big
promoters on commercial radio.

WRCT took a while to become
the beacon of independencethat
it is now. The station began 42
years ago, broadcasting on carri-
er current to the CMU dorms.
During the '60s and early '70s,
WRCT was a pop music station
with 10 watts of FM power.

In 1979, the antenna was
moved to the roof of the six-story
Warner Hall, and the station be-
gan reaching college listeners
with a mixture of punk, jazz, folk,
wacky talk shows and lots of
Devo. Then came the ”new
wave” era, when WRCT adopt-
ed an evening format of up-and-
coming groups such as Duran
Duran and the Cure. The new
I

on WRCT.

The advent of MTV and other
commercial sources of ”new
music” resulted in a dilemma for
WRCT — should they stay within
the college rock format or move
on to more radical territory? In
the spring of 1984, WRCT in-
creased its power to 100 watts,
and the more creative DJs
prevailed, as the station now
reaches a 20—mi|e radius with its
eclectic musical mix.

Besides alternative music,
WRCT programs several shows to
serve the CMU campus. The
News Forum and Sportsline
hours covered the events, issues,
and athletic exploits of CMU stu-
dents, and the Freedom of
Speech program sponsored heat-
ed debates on controversial
topics between right-wing and
leftist panels. WRCT also broad-
casts live from the CMU Spring
Carnival and buggy races, as well
as the Tartan football, basketball
and hockey games. -

WRCT revives an old tradition
this year to better acquaint new
listeners with the many types of
music played on the station. ”The
Anatomy of the Ear” series runs
from 6 p.m. to midnight, Aug. 29
through Sept. 2. Each three—hour
block focuses on a certain style
of alternative music.

An expanded version of the
WRCT program guide will be
printed this fall to familiarize
listeners with individual shows,
and the radio station is likely to

present more live concerts and

dances on campus in the near fu-
ture. WRCT is bustling with more
activity than ever before, which
verifies the hopeful words of John
Fetkovich: ”As long as it remains
lively and changing, WRCT will
always bring the best music to
your radio.”

Sorry, no XX marking the spot at 100.7 FM

By Joan Kane
For The Pitt News

At 12 a.m. on August 3, 100.7
WXXP aptly played ’’It’s the End
of the World As We Know lt” and
then went off the air.

”Aptly” because for many of its
loyal listeners there is much more
to the demise of WXXP than just
the loss of an alternative radio
station.

During its two year-existence,
”Double X ” not only enter-
tained, but also made new mus-
ic more easily accessible,
creating a subculture of sorts in
the process. WXXP was respon-
sible for bringing new music acts
to town, developing a market for
new music and supporting local
talent.

Will new music acts such as
Depeche Mode, The Church and
the Mighty Lemon Drops still
come to Pittsburgh without a
commercial radio station to pro-
mote them? Renee Poliak of
DiCesare-Engler said yes, for the
most part. Poliak stated that it is

the job of the promoter to present ’

a variety of shows, including new

music acts, to the public.

”There is a demand for new
music shows, and we will con-
tinue to supply that demand,”
she said.

However, producers aren't cer-
tain how they are going to adver-
tise and promote new music
shows.

”—

There is a demand
for new music shows,
and we will continue to
supply that demand.

— Renee Poliak

”We’l| use different promo-
tions.l’m not really sure yet. We
have to figure out a new game
plan,” Poliak said.

As well as promoting new mus-
ic concerts, WXXP propelled new
music sales. Because of Double
X the availability of progressive
music increased.

Doug Smith, buyer for Nation-

al Record Mart, admitted that pur-
chasing habits may change now
that WXXP is gone.

Smith stated that the more
”mainstream” acts like The Cure
will still be readily available, but
the more obscure groups, such as
Stump and The Bible, will be
harder to find. He added that
there will be fewer customer re-
quests, and that too will affect
purchasing.

WXXP often featured local
music in their rotation. Bands like
the Affordable Floors, the Clarks
and the Spuds all benefited from
exposure on WXXP.

Smith said that National Record
Mart will probably continue to
purchase recordings from local
artists, but he wasn't sure. Now
that Double X is gone, airplay on
commercial radio stations for lo-
cal bands is limited.

Kirk Botula, keyboardist of the
Affordable Floors, believes that
the loss of WXXP will have a
negative effect on the growing
Pittsburgh music scene.

”Doub|e X was a positive cul-
tural force. It allowed people to
hear material that they otherwise

wouldn't hear. The people who
are really going to be hurt are the
bands that we haven't heard from
yet,” he said.

According to Mike Whited,
manager of the Clarks and 11th
Hour, the absence of WXXP will
only hurt momentarily. it will
cause local groups to become
more resourceful, which will ul-
timately allow for more exposure.
For example, Whited said that his
bands have talked with other
commercial stations in hopes of
reaching a larger audience.

”We’ve talked with WDVE and
we’re getting their support.
WXXP was good in that it gave us
and other local bands the initial
start, but now it's time for us to
try to expand,” Whited said.

Aside from airplay, WXXP ad-
vertised many local bands’
shows. ”People listened to XXP
to find out what was going on,”
Whited said. Now local bands
that don't get a commercial sta-
tion’s support will have to devise
new advertising strategies if they
want to draw crowds and build
a following.

The Affordable Floors are for-

tunate in that they have already
attracted a large, diverse and loy-
al following. But Botula agreed
that without Double X it will be
more difficult and costly for
bands to reach people and make
them aware of shows. ”We have
a mailing list and we send out
monthly newsletters that tell of
upcoming shows,” he added.

Alternative music will still be
found in Pittsburgh, although it
won’t be as prominent as it has
been for the past two years. You
may have to look a little harder
for certain albums or wait a little
longer for certain acts to come to
town.

But as Kirk Botula pointed out,
”The progressive audience is an
active audience. They make it
their business to know.”

Rob Hertweck, the Clarks’
guitarist, is also fairly optimistic:
”We’re not going to be jaded.
We were spoiled by Double X,
but now we're going to have to
be more resourceful. I think the
music is going to get more com-
petitive —— no, not really more
competitive, but definitely more
creative.”

Barbed Wire Dolls

By Susan Washburn

Assistant Showcase Editor

They're not playthings.

Although they're cute and fun
to watch, the Barbed Wire Dolls
really shouldn't be touched. You
can talk to them, though, if you
make the first move. They're a lit-
tle shy.

Truly an all—girl band, they like
eating, shopping and soothing

pre—show jitters by putting on .

make-up and picking out girlie-
wear. In concert, Shawnna
prefers something strapless while
Tris likes leather. Yvonne would
like to wear a rubber skirt and
probably will as soon as she can
afford one.

If you want dance,

0 fine. It's personal and

fun stuff, nothing po-
Iitical.

— Yvonne Mance
_
W ll

With hair colors ranging from
pink to blue, the image they cre-
ate is one of unintended sexuali-
ty. They're cute and they know it.

They use it. But, as Yvonne points _

out, they're not on stage with
their legs spread. I

Though not quite a straight-
edge band, the ‘Barbed ,Wire
Dolls prefer drinking juice to al-
cohol, but when it comes to eat-

Three of the band members
eat, sleep and drink together in
the same house with their dog
Friday, while the other commutes
from North Hills. A

Shawnna Biondo (singer),
Yvonne Mance (bass) and Tris
Timney (guitar) all live together in
a house on Alder, while Michelle
Efremanko drives into Oakland
from the North Hills.

All of them have wanted to be
in a band since they were in high
school, and most of them were;
however, they quickly point out
that the bands were not good and
that it's better to forget the entire
expenence.

”—

There's no place to
play if you're not main-
stream.

— Sha wnna Biondo

Taking their name from a
movie title, The Barbed Wire
Dolls have played together for
two months and despite the girlie
image, each band member has a
very definite idea of what pur-
pose music should serve.

They go against the mainstream
and are unhappy withthe Pitts-
burgh music: scene. Or, rather,
the lack of a Pittsburgh music
scene.

"There's no place to play if
you're not mainstream," said
Shawnna. There aren't many
places that give new bands a
chance and many new bands are
naive, playing for only $5 a show

while. .the.cI.uh .char.ge.s. at ..leasL . .

that much as a cover charge, ac-
cording to Yvonne.

Despite the lack of enthusiasm
for punk rock in Pittsburgh, the
Barbed Wire Dolls will stay, for
a while. They would like to tour
— anywhere. _

The music of the Barbed Wire
Dolls is raw and distorted. It's
made for toe—tapping. It makes
you pogo. "We don't lecture,"
said Shawnna. ,

"If you want to dance, fine,"
added Yvonne. "|t's personal and
fun stuff, nothing political."

The Barbed Wire Dolls are
punk rock girls who enjoy per-
forming as much as practicing.
They like a responsive audience,
one that dances, claps and talks
to them after the show.

To find out where the Barbed

‘ wire Dolls are playing check The

Pitt News calendar or the In Pitts-
burgh listings.

Reminder: you don't have to be
punk to have a good time at their
show.

By Joan Kane
For The Pitt News

According to Michael Whit-
ed, manager of two of the
area's more popular rock
bands (the Clarks and 11th
Hour), "Music is a reflection
of your soul." If this is the
case, then the Clarks are some
really soulful dudes.

Hailing from the depths of
Indiana University of Pa., the
Clarks are: singer/guitarist
Scott "Phydo" ‘Blasey, lead
guitarist Rob Hertweck, bassist
Greg "Chief" Joseph and
drummer Dave Minarek.

What makes these four regu-
lar, everyday guys so soulful
and special is their fiery and
energetic music. Fueled by
Phydo's strong stage presence,
Hertweck’s searing rifts,
Chief's powerful, rhythmic
bass lines and Minarik’s pas-
sionate, driving beat, the
Clarks create a riveting sound
that's pure, heartfelt rock and
roll. Their lyrics are honest and
straightforward, their delivery

is sincere and spirited.

On stage, the band is raw
energy. They are an explosion
waiting to happen. On their
recently released album, I'll
Tell You What Man, the
Clarks, with help from their
producer, Hank Lawhead, suc-
cessfully harnessed and
reproduced their volatile
sound. —

Their album is a step in the
right direction. Hertweck cit-
ed its release as "a momen-
tous occasion for the band. It's
an official, professional state-
ment for us. We're establish-
ing a beginning for the band.
We want to gain credibility."

Of the cuts on the LP, Hert-
weck denied having one par-
ticular favorite, but_ called 7
"Perfection Not Required"
Phydo's "anthem about rock
and roll." .

All of the songs characteristi-
cally feature strong, propelling
rhythms. According to Hert-
weck, it's Chief and Minarek
who set the pace for the V
Clarks’ fast and furious rock.

Keeping time with the Clarks  

"There's nothing like having
a good, energetic drummer
like Dave Minarek. He is the
heart and soul of the band,
with his driving and powerful
rhythm," Hertweck added.

The Clarks do offer some
diversity and a slight change of
speed with one song, "All
That Much." It's a slower track
featuring Minarek and Hert-
weck on acoustic guitars and
Phydo on the autoharp.

"Phydo sounds great on that
track. The different instru-
ments added a completely
different atmosphere to the
song," Hertweck said.

One thing that Hertweck
stresses is the comradery his

band has with other local‘

artists.

"We're fans of other local
bands. We go out and see
them play," he said.

With the birth and develop-
ment of all the local talent, the
Pittsburgh music "scene is
definitely expanding, and the
Clarks are playing a major part
in this growth.

A fish and a woman called Wanda

By William Young

Managing Editor

With Monty Python not likely
to ever return to the silver screen,
diehard fans and bandwagon
jumpers alike will have to content
themselves with the efforts of
former Python John Cleese.

Cleese’s latest creation is A Fish
Called Wanda, an intensely wit-
ty tale of British barrister Archie
Leach who gets entangled with a
group of double-crossing jewel
thieves. While Cleese may be the
star of the movie, Kevin Kline out-
shines all with his portrayal of
Otto —— a not—so-intelligent thief
who reads philosophy.

Python Michael Palm) and his
zironounced stutter are hilarious,
‘.'()njUl’ll'l_2 memories or a sixth-
grade bully poking run at the
class nerd.
E The story, written by Cleese,
abounds with watered—down
Monty Python absurdity while
trying to avoid the Python trait of
slapstick-style humor. The
characters are so well defined
that you feel at ease with them af-
ter the first 20 minutes have
passed. Indeed, you wonder why
the film has to end when it does,
because the characters are so
delightful that you feel like your
bestfriend has just moved to
North Dakota when the credits

start rolling.

Director Michael Crichton
deserves credit for being able to
keep all of the characters within
humorous reason and for keeping
the serious scenes in the movie
to the barest minimum. It is
Crichton’s hand which allows the
viewer to laugh at every scene
Kline is in by de-emphasizing the

sadistic qualities of his character
and making them seem
laughable.

A Fish Cal/ed Wanda is
definitely a "must see” for all true
fans of Monty Python, while all
comedy movie lovers have no
option but to see the year's fun-
niest film.

Silver screen sizzles

By Michele Kiraly
Staff Writer

While nearly everything in
sight sizzled this summer, the
silver screen managed to get
only slightly warm. Blame it
on the season. The idea of
Hollywood producing light,
summer entertainment has be-
come a tiresome tradition. So
if you're waiting to see a film
with some weight to it, hang
on just a while longer until the
meatier fall season begins.

Well, all in all, mainstream
cinema did have a mighty
sampling of styles. A couple of
sequels weren t called exact-
lv that, even though Eddie
"vltrrphy trades in his gun ior
a mop in Coming to America
, and Tom Cruise in (jncl<tai/
breaks glasses instead of a tri-
angle of pool balls. The story-
lines were basically the same:
Murphy was funny and Cruise
looked pretty.

The P-Man stepped out of
his Saturday morning run for
Big Top Pee-Wee, a film
which was probably a bit
more riveting than expected
with a live love scene and,
worse, less humor. Pee-Wee
seems better suited for 10 a.m.
than 10 p.m. His weirdness is
hilarious in a half—hour morn-
ing show, but a 90 -minute
movie wears on your
tolerance.

Kevin Costner in his third
solid role( The Untouchables
and No Way Out being the
first two), gives an amiable
performance as the baseball
player who slips out of the
grasp of Susan Sarandon in
Bull Durham.

Die Hard is a Bruce Willis
feature that is full of action:
everything gets blown up. Wil-
lis is rather drab here, but for
some decent acting watch re-
runs of TV’s Moonlighting.

Tom Hanks isn't taking care
of babies in Big. Here, Hanks
is a kid whose dream of being
grown up really happens. The
movie sports some funny

scenes, but these switcheroo
movies are getting ridiculous.
First, there was the grown
woman who shrunk, then the
father and son who swapped
brains, and now, a kid who
blooms overnight.

Dirty Harry is back again.
Clint Eastwood's role as the
dry—humoured, justice-
preaching cop really sinks in
The Dead Pool. What hap-
pened to the mysterious man
who wore black in all those
westerns? Eastwood just isn't
as interesting anymore.

Don't despair, this ripped-
up list contains at least one
positive review. Who would
imagine iiiigs Bunny and
.=\.«li(‘ke\. .'.»<itise aw!‘ great
izuvs. -:2 the same iiim even
the same scene? Thank the
folks at Warner Brothers, Dis-
ney, the multitude of anima-
tion artists, Kathleen Turner's
voice for the character of Jes-
sica and Touchstone Pictures
who brought this summer's
salvation of
Roger Rabbit.

Yes, it is a cartoon, but an
amazing one. Things match.
You'll have to look hard to no-
tice any incongruity when the
detective (Bob Hoskins) is
handcuffed to the Toon (as
they're called), Roger Rabbit.
Roger seems like a real charac-
ter and not just drawn in after
the fact. The story isisort of
dull, the old ”murder—and-
frame-someone—else" line.

In this past film season, a
relative newcomer like Cost-
ner outshined a veteran actor
like Eastwood. Call it time to
move on.

Speaking of shining, did you
see the latest movie from Pitts-
burgh horror king George
Romero? It's called Monkey-
shines ,and it's the story of a
crippled man and his pet mon-
key. /\/lonkeyshines is much
better than all those cute Spiel-
berg animals-as—ki|lers stories.
Add this one to your back—to—
school list.

The PPC has plans for you

By Mindy Boffemmyer

Showcase Editor

Statistically, the average Pitt
student participates in at least
four Program Council activities
each year.

So the Pitt Program Council,
with its long history of providing
students with scads of fun, is al-
ready planning a whole slew of
activities for the fall.

Third World will kick off the
festivities at the Annual Welcome
Back Concert on Flagstaff Hill
September 11.

The Program Council is respon-
sible for bringing us Friday and
Saturday night movies in the
David Lawrence, the films shown
in the video room of the William
Pitt Union and classics on Wed-
nesday nights in the WPU Assem-
bly Room.

Movies to grace the David
Lawrence Friday and Saturday
nights will include Fatal Attrac-
tion, Broadcast News, Good

Morning Vietnam, and Talking‘

Heads-Stop Making Sense.

The Affordable Floors are just
one of the bands that will perform
during a ”Friday Night in the
Concourse.”

The Program Council also or-
ganizes Homecoming activities,
such as the Homecoming Parade
and the formal on the Gateway
Clipper.

A few trips are being planned
this year, including a ski trip and

the annual trip to Daytona Beach.

In recognition of the 25th an-
niversary of the assassination of
John F. Kennedy, the P.P.C. will
sponsor a lecture in November to
shed more light on that historical
event

The Pitt Program Council will
bring the controversial, some-
times menacing Morton Downey

Jr. to the David Lawrence on De-
cember 4.

The Pitt Program Council also
offers a series of non—credit, low-
cost leisure learning courses an-
nually.

Various other events, such as
major art programs, coffee-
houses, concerts and recreation-
al tournaments, are organized
each year by the Pitt Program
Council.

A weekly planner is published
by the P.P.C. to keep students
abreast of the schedule of events.
It includes the dates of games,
university deadlines, Program
Council activities and film and
video schedules.

Between 250 and 300 students
work on the Program Council
each year. From developing the
ideas to cleaning up afterward,
students do all of the work in-
volved in each activity.

These programs are funded by
the student activites fee, which
helps to keep costs minimal.
Many of the activities are free.

Be sure to attend your ”at least
four” Pitt Program Council activi-
ties this fall.

The Dance Alloy, a profession-
al, contemporary repertory dance
company based in Pittsburgh,
will begin its ’88—89 season on
October 15 with a program
featuring dinosaurs and dreams.

Lost Continent, commissioned
and performed by the Dance Al-
loy last season, will return again
this year. This examination of hu-
man reaction to dinosaurs and
other ”horrors” explores the
question: ”Why do people love
to scare themselves?” Lost Con-
tinent is a mixed-media show
combining dance, narrative and
video.

Acclaimed choreographer
Stephen Koester has been com-
missioned by the Dance Alloy to
create a new work to premiere
during the A||oy’s October per-
formances.

Catlin Cobb's House of Drawn
Shades, set on the Dance Alloy
in 1986, is a dramatic dream-
scape encompassing the imagery
of the subconscious and the as-
trological house of beginnings
and endings.

This year, the Al|oy’s subscrip-
tion series has been expanded to
include performances at the Mt.

City Theatre: home of the brave playmakers

By Susan Washburn

Assistant Showcase Editor

From Miller to Mamet and
Henley to Howe, the diversity of
American playwrights has been
growing steadily. American dra-
ma is reaching out to include
women and minorities as central
characters, in addition to in-
troducing new treatment of
rharacters.

Keeping pace with the changes
in the character or American dra-
ma is the City Theatre. Inthe past,
inetCity Theatre has produced
works by and about women, in-
tiuding Beth Henley’s Crimes of
the Heart, HOwe’s Painting
Churches and Eric Overmyer’s
On the Verge. 0

The company, has also
produced plays that address the
problems of racism, class tension
and the unrealistic qualities of the
American Dream.

/The City Theatre is committed
to producing good theatre, no
matter what the source. They do
not choose scripts by the sex or
ethnicity of the playwright, but
rather by the content.

”Good theater is good theater,
whether it's written by women,
gays or blacks. We want to

iproduce good theater,” said

Robert Marinaccio, managing
director of the City Theatre. 1

added. pp
A current issue in American

drama is the casting of minorities _

in traditionally white roles, since
in many plays, the color of the ac-
tor is meaningless to his or her
character.

The City Theatre is incorporat-
ing this attitude in this season by
casting a blackin a ”white” role.

’’It doesn't matter,” said
Marinaccio, ”these two could fall
in love as easily as two white
people.” Marinaccio was refer-
ring to the love interest in this
season's production of Frankie &
lohnniein the Clair de Lune.

 

ty. The split is due to the physi-

cal changes the university has

planned for its future, plans that
include he demolition of the
t uilding that currently houses the
City Theatre. 1
’’Over the last few years, it be-
came very apparent that the
space we perform in is slated for
demolition,” said Marinaccio.
City Theatre is currently search-
ing for a new building in which

-they can stage their productions.
One possible. location is the .

Southside.

"We'd like to be on the South-
side. It's an active; exciting place
to be,” he said.

In addition. to producing works
by nationally acclaimed
playwrights, the companyhas a
long record of presenting new
scripts by local playwrights. Lo-
cal artists are included in the
Tuesday Night Theatre series.

ings of new plays throughout the

Managing Editor

So you want to dance, but you
just can't bring yourself to get on
Zelda's dancefloor. It just doesn’t
seem quite right. Or maybe it's
the music — you'd rather not
twist and shout to the latest tune
by George Michael. But where
do you go? A 1

Well, clip this article and keep
it handy for the rest of your col-
lege career, because this may be
the only semi—definitive listing of
actual dance clubs where you
can go to dance to your favorite
kind of music, whether or not it’s
Top 40.

If live bands are what you’re
into, then the premier spot to go
is Graffiti, located on Baum Blvd.
Graffiti offers “the best in local
bands playing original music and
an atmosphere to match. The
likes of The Affordable Floors,
Eleventh Hour and The Sponges
regularly spark epidemics of
dance fever as they fill the house
with eager beavers looking for
the best in bop.

While the cover may be a little
stiff for most college economists
(usually five to seven dollars), the
wise student will skip happy hour
to save his money for a better
time at Graffiti. If it takes you a
while to work up your nerve be-
fore you can hit the dance floor,

"th'e‘re‘a're' plenty of seats, both on

the floor and in the balconies,
that allow you enjoy both the
band on the stage and the
dancers on the floor.

If putting all your eggs in the
live music basket seems too
much of a gamble for you, you
can always head down Forbes to
the Upstage.

The only thing that counts
about the Upstage is that you like
to dance. It offers progressive
music on Saturdays and Top 40
on Thursday and Friday, so that
everyone can enjoy shaking and
grooving to their favorite sounds.
You can even go the Upstage and
dance with yourself in front of

Can you read the writing on the wall! It's Graffiti.

their giant mirror if you can't get
any of your friends to shed their
inhibitions and join you for an
evening of fun. _

Those of you who were for-
tunate enough to have ever gone
to the Upstage before it became
a born-again Top 40 club will
remember the clientele dancing
with wild abandon to the latest in
progressive music and videos.
Well, fear not, faint—hearted mus-
ic lover, there are-still two places
that refuse to succumb (entirely)
to the evil pop-music god.

one of the most staunch Top 40
clubs, had a change of heart over

the summer and decided to play

progressive tunes on Monday
nights, complete with all of the
club's normal special effects.
Once you get past the big neon
Confetti sign, the club gets
demonstrably less flashy,
although not necessarily less
tacky. The entire place is be-
decked with all sorts of plants,
although it's too dark to care
whether or not they're actually
real.

The dance floor is fairly large,
so there's plenty of room for any
large number of people to bump
into each other when the fog
machine and confetti cannons

And some otbance clubs

Jon Wells/The Pitt News

are turned on.

Now, don't worry, if you're not
quite into the progressive scene,
Confetti offers the normal reper-
toire of dance music on all the
other nights it's open so that
everyone can be musically
satisfied.

Anyone mourning the death of
Mirage this summer can now
stop. Although Mirage hasn't re-
opened, Pittsburgh has finally
made it to the big leagues of
nightclubs with the opening of
the Metropol. The Metropol plays
the same music as all of the
above clubs but has the added
bonus of actually being a dance

club a la New York and L.A.
style.

You can find the Metropol
downtown in the Strip district, in-
side a converted warehouse that's
probably better off now as a club.
There’s tons of room inside to
wander around, and the dance

floors resemble the African veldt

for spaciousness.

Thursday and Sunday nights
have been dubbed progressive
music nights, while the rest have

been relegated to standard dance‘

music from the pop world. The
Metropol’s Dis, however, say that
they don’t play just Top 40 on
Top 40 nights because they like
to mix all sorts of music — so be
prepared for a variety. There's no
dress code, so come as you are
with your two bucks by Thurs-
day, otherwise you’ll need five
on Friday and Saturday. Don't
hesitate to check this place out if

"you're tired of the humdrum

Oakland scene.

If dancing with the college
crowd just isn't your scene, you
can dance with the yuppies at
Chaunciesfperhaps the last bas-
tion of the disco era. The music
is almost entirely dance remixes
of B—94’s playlist, which means
you can dance almost a full 10
minutes to each song.

The crowd, mind you, is
definitely not ”hip,” and neither
is the atmosphere. However, the

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 29, 1988

A guide to the record stores of Pittsburgh

By Joel Timulak

Assistant Showcase Editor

The college years have been
called ”the best four years of your
life.’’ This is, of course, your
guidance counse|or’s sublimated
apology for the poor high school
education he knows you've
received and an encouragement
for the future, as he also knows
what a seemingly bottomless pit
of fire the high school years are.
At the very least, the college years
are your experimental years, a
time when you can weigh the
ideas of others against your own.

The college years are also a
time for music, whatever music
means to you. In a large sense, art
is not only for fun, but also for
challenge. Be it a polite invitation
under the heading of new or a
direct assault on the way you
hear music, the way you perceive
things, and, why not, the way you
have fun; it should be challenged.

Pittsburgh has a few great
record stores. Those of you who
consider yourselves open-
minded will have more openness
than you know what to do with.
Those of you who come from
other cities and are used to great
record stores will not be disap-
pointed with your college town.

Eide’s, located downtown (940
Penn Avenue), is a big store. They
have enough comic books, rock
paraphernalia (posters, shirts,
badges, stickers) and books to
break any skate rat’s wallet. Their

specialty is, of course, records: in-

die labels galore, limited editions,

CDs, imports, reissues, 12-inches,
singles from that Texas hardcore
band you saw last March in Phil-
ly; you name it.

The prices are pretty fair at
Eide’s, too. Domestic LPs are a
couple of bucks cheaper than the
big chain stores’, and the variety
is no comparison. If you like it,
go often; there's always turnover
on the stock. If that hard—to-find
Swans record isn't on the racks,
it may show up next week. And
the limited prints go fast. Be sure
to check out the rack of fanzines
and band-bio books.

Jim's Records (4526 Liberty
Avenue in Bloomfield) is smaller,
tidier and quieter — but don't let
that fool you. They have a great
stock similar to Eide’s at prices
often a bit lower. Other than the
book and British music press
rack, Jim's concentrates exclu-
sively on records. They also have
CDs and a few cassettes.

And singles. Don't leave Jim's
without checking out the enor-
mous, unmatched collection of
seven-inches behind the counter.
Vinyl collectors will be delighted,
if not shocked. Also among the
racks at Jim's Records is a large
bootleg selection. Some are
priceless (as bootlegs go), and all
are expensive -— not for the meek
of wallet.

Eide’s is easily accessible if
you're downtown. Just get on
Penn and walk away from town.
It's only a few blocks up on the
right. You can get downtown
from Oakland by catching any 71
or 61 bus across the street from

the Towers on Fifth.

Jim's Records can be reached
by taking a 54C, caught on the
Towers side of Fifth, going away
from downtown. The bus winds
through Oakland and Bloom-
field. Watch the street signs until
you see Liberty Avenue. Jim's is
a few blocks down on the left at
4526.

A tidy option open to the just-

‘paid music lover is to visit Jim's

via 54C and then take any bus
downtown from.Jim’s to Eide’s. If

you can't find it at one, you'll.

probably find it at the other.

Also worthy of note is the
Phantom of the Attic, just a block
behind the Cathedral on South
Craig. The Phantom is mostly a
comic book store but has a few
racks and boxes of underground
records on independent labels
and a load of CDs, most of which
will never be found in a chain
store.

As for used records, there are
two buy-sell—trade stores right
here in Oakland. Jerry’s Records,
located uptairs from McDonald's
on Forbes, stocks a vast number

‘ of second-hand and cut-out jazz,

rock and folk records. Jerry’s is
the Salvation Army of record
stores; you have to wade through

a mound of junk to find a gem.

Also on Forbes, a few blocks
up from the Cathedral, is the
Record Graveyard. They retail a
small stock of dance records and

jmajor—|abe| rock releases in addi-

tion to rows of second-hand
vinyl.

routine and being within a
system’.

”Actors need to be prepared to
face a world that is not neat and
orderly like the school. School
tends to be protective and insu-
lar. Actors need to be vulnerable,
exposed to everything.”

Anne Louise feels, however,
that studying theater in a dis-
ciplined environment tends to be
beneficial.

”I had a lot of reasons for com-
ing to the states and working for
an M.F.A. I function well in a
school setting. I understand it and
I am organized. Then there are
the professional opportunities.
And it was a chance for me to
study in another country.”

She doesn't regret her decision
to further her education and train-
ing before delving into the world
of professional theater.

’’I look at my friends pounding

the pavementin Toronto, which
is what I'd be doing, and I think
I have a lot more credits to my
name. I don't feel that I'm miss-
ing out or that I won't be as
prepared.”

In order to prepare herself for
professional theater and to make
professional contacts, Anne
Louise has worked outside of Pitt
during the summer. She is cur-
rently playing Corinna in The
House of Blue Leaves at Theatre
Hartwood. ’

”I audition for things outside of
Pitt. I don't think I'll feel like afish
out of water when I graduate. As
long as you don't allowtyourself
to remain sheltered in an institu-
tional cocoon, you'll be fine.”

The schedule ofan M.F.A. can-
didate in acting at Pitt is very
strenuous. Six days a week the
M.F.A. candidates arrive for class-
es early in the morning, have two
breaks, for lunch and dinner, and
return home a little before mid-
night._Their ”free” day is spent
preparing for the classes that they
teach.

 

”There is no time for dance and
voice instruction. Skills that are
not directly a part of theater are
your responsibility.”

Anne Louise is in her second’

year of the M.F.A. program and
has spent several years develop-
ing skills such as dancing, sing-
ing and fencing in various
classes.

Acting, as a career, involves
tremendous sacrifice, and Anne
Louise has accepted those terms.

”It means a life of very frugal
living. I won't have the things that
other people have. It means giv-
ing up a lot in personal relation-

ships, moving around a lot, being I

as transient as we are. I under-
stand all that, but I still choose
this.” ‘ 9

Why? What is it that -drives a
person to work so hard, for
almost always so little? Eve Har-
rington (All About Eve) would

say, ”Why, ifthere’s nothing else, '

there's applause.”
Anne Louise says, ”To people
who are real actors, there's real-

ly nothing else that you can do

but act. What you feel is that you
can’t be fulfilled any other way.
I always knew that I wanted to
perform.

”The best actors that I have
seen are the ones who have
made that decision andare hap-
py doing it.”

She is very professional.

”I’m happiest when I'm on-
stage. I become unhappy work-
ing with people who don’t take
it seriously.”

As for her current aspirations,
her hopes for the realization of
years of work and sacrific«e»:u’/~My
dream isto go home to Canada
to perform in the Stratford
Festival.”

At longlast, a head—pIeasing chat with The Pleasureheads

By Manny Theiner

For the Pitt News

The next time you see a six-
inch spider crawling up a tele-
phone pole, don't swat at it. The
offending arachnid might just be-
long to a poster of the Pleasure-
heads, a band busting out of the
dark recesses of Oakland in a big
way. .

Their saga began in January
1987 when Patty Pisula, former-
ly guitarist for Bone of Conten-
tion, was introduced by Steve
Fabian of the Heretics to a new
guitar player named Debbie
Catanzaro. They hit it off right
away, and with the addition of a
bassist and drummer, they made
their well-received debut at the
Squirrel Hill American Legion.

Part of the creative’ inspiration
for Pisula came from her admira-
tion for Velvet Underground.
”Meeting Lou Reed was the high
point of my life,” she says.

A More relevant to her, however,
was the practical example of
Columbus band Scrawl. ”They’re
not pretentious, they write from
a female perspective, and they
really rock,” explains Pisu-
la.”That’s how we wanted to be.”
The name of the group itself
originates from a Birthday Party
song, ”Sometimes Pleasure
Heads Must Burn.”

The Pleasureheads have al-
ready burned a swath through
Pittsburgh, as they are one of the
few newer bands to have consis-
tently played all three established
”alternative” venues — the De-
cade, Graffiti and the Electric

.Banana.

Though college radio has given
them considerable support (No.
1 on WRCT and No. 15 on
WPTS), Catanzaro berates the
commercial stations for walking
too narrow a path. ”They claim

to play local music, but WXXP
only played new wave dance and
WMYG just had old fossils like
Norm Nardini. So that left us out,
among many others.”

The band also had trouble
grabbing the attention of in-
dependent labels. ”No one even
called back and said ‘No, we
don't like your stuff,’ ” laments
Catanzaro.

”We were completely ig-
nored,” agrees Pisula. ”lt’s as if
we sent the demo to CBS.”

Fortunately, they didn't have to
wait long for a record, as Greg
Kostelich of the Cynics soon con-

sented to release a Pleasureheads

single on his label, Get Hip
Records.

”There’s a problem of easy
pigeonholing, since everything
on Get Hip is automatically la-
beled garage punk. That’s the rea-
son Greg founded the label,”
says Pisula. ”He’s a musician,
though, and understands that a
band's not going to want to sign
away the rights to their songs."

The debut single, containing
”Song For God” backed with
”Clove Cigarettes,” will be
released in late September with
an initial pressing of 500. The
record represents a wide spec-
trum of their sound, according to

the ”songwriting matriarchy" of
Pisula and Catanzaro.

Backing up the matriarchs are
two fresh but eager fellows —
bassist’Smith Hutchings, known
for his stints with the Shunts and
2 x 45, and brand new drummer
Larry Loreti, who was found af-
ter an intense search for a relia-
ble player.

”Drummers are so hard to
find,” says Catanzaro. ”By the
time we teach them the songs,
they back out, and we have to
find someone else.”

A steady lineup is obviously
important for the survival of the
group, especially if they want to

showcase their talents in front of
national acts, as they have recent-
ly done with the Pixies and Sal-
em 66. In the meantime, they had
their chance to impress Pitt stu-
dents (a finicky bunch) on Sun-
day, along with three other local
bands.

The near future involves prac-
ticing in the ”Pleasure Cube” on
Centre Avenue and more work in
the recording studio, so that if the
single is a success, a full-length
LP could possibly follow soon.
The Pleasureheads certainly have
the right attitude, as Smith Hutch-
ings says with a totally serious
face/‘We mean business.”

Where Pitt students go at night to get liquored...  

By Frances Sansig
For The Pitt News

It's the first one you see when
you come into Oakland via Bates
Street. It's not a derivative of the
word you might be thinking of-
it’s an acronym for the three own-
ers, Sullivan, O'Brien and
DeFrancesco.

The SOD is just one bar in
Oakland. Just one bar in
Pittsburgh.

And there's nothing like being
in one of them on a Friday night.
Freshmen might not be wise to

the system here yet, but you're
supposed to try and schedule
your classes so your first one isn't
until 3 or 4 p.m. on Friday so you
can go drinking on Thursday
night, too. That's a pretty big
night here in Oakland. What the
hell, Friday's are wasted days
anyways.

All this information about bars
isn't going to do you much good
if you're a typical freshman — but
transfer and older students can
benefit. Freshmen will just have
to figure out for themselves
where to go — you'll probably

likely.

But back to the bars.

People go to the SOD for the
pool, I hear.

Then, on the same street (Sem-
ple), there's Phillip D's. The pool
playing’s good there, too. Some
sharp players hang out there.

There's a cute little bar called
Denny's on Louisa St. They're
strict about carding there — I

t know just last summer, I couldn't

get in.

In fact, there were a lot of
places I couldn't get in —— if you
want to know the ones I could get
into, you'll have to call me.

One bar a lot of underage guys
would like to get into is Antho-
ny's Go—Go Lounge. I'm sure you
can figure what goes on there.

They do have good pizza,
though. I know, my boyfriend
told me. Don't ask me how he
knows.

Toward central Oakland, some
hot "college" spots are C.l. Bar-
ney's, Caleco’s and Zelda's. Zel-

musician John Puckett plays
there. John, if you're out there,
my old roommate, whom we'll
just call "Viv," and I are in love
with you!

C.J.'s has a nice, friendly_at—
mosphere, a cool disc jockey
who plays a good mixture of
tunes and good food, ifyou're in
the mood.

I've only been to Caleco’s a
few times — it gets pretty crowd-
ed, as do most of the bars on
weekend nights, but it's great for
people who like to meet up with
a lot of people they know, like I
do.

If you want to hang out where
the professors do, Hemingway's,
which is adjacent to C.J.'s, is the
place to go. And since I've deve-
loped a great love of jazz music
(honed by years of listening to my
sister, who is a musician, jazz be-
ing her specialty) I like to go there
because they have some pretty
cool jazz bands playing there.

Plus, they make good Blue
Hawaii's, my favorite drink.

Moving into North Oakland
territory, there's Thirsty's - a
nice bar where John Puckett also
plays sometimes. The at-

mosphere is fun but tame. Right

one place that stands out in my
mind — The Balcony. Good,
loud jazz delivered from people
who look like they were meant to
do nothing else but play it. God,
I should have been a beatnik.

I used to love Brendan's on
Walnut Street until it closed, be-
cause local jazz musician Harold
Betters, who's from my
hometown, played there. Check
him out sometime — he plays
other clubs in the area.

Blue Lou's, I'm told, is ”neat.”
That's because they have a fire-
pole inside. They serve drinks out
of dog dishes and fish bowls.
Whew. I’/I have to go there
sometime.

Doc's Place is another place
you might want to check out
while you're in Shadyside.

But one of my most favorite
places is Peter's Pub in central
Oakland. Go on Grateful Dead
