Conference explores avenues of Internet

By Kathleen‘Scanlon
News Editor

There are those who say the
Internet will turn people into
inactive, isolated info-surfers.
Instead of going to the grocery
store, we’ll order groceries over
the computer. Instead of going
to the bank, we’ll deposit
money with the click of the
mouse.

But members of the national
council that will advise the

Internet issues have a different
view. They see doctors transfer-
ring medical records over the
network, monitoring the vital
signs of patients in their homes,

, doing remote consultations and

diagnoses.

And that time not spent run-
ning to the grocery store and
bank? Maybe you can think of
other ways you’d like to spend
your time.

“It will allow us to learn and
grow and stay healthier,” said

CEO of Bell
Pennsylvania.

“The information network
will link our homes. schools.
businesses and hospitals and
will improve our lives."

At a chancellor's conference
Tuesday. members of the
National Information
Infrastructure Advisory
Council presented some of the
problems and possibilities they
find arising in the information
age. The council was created in

Atlantic of

president about how to handle

William Harral, president and

January 1994 to

advise

President Clinton about issues
of, among other things, access,
security and regulation of the
Internet.

This was the first regional
conference for the council, and
it focused on how these issues
will impact business, communi-
ty, education, government and
health care in southwestern
Pennsylvania.

“What difference does this
make for the fourth grader in
East Liberty?" Bearman said.

Network links people in need

By Jackie Duggan
Asst. News Editor

-After watching a movie one night with
her husband, Darla Kash stood up from the
couch and noticed she suddenly felt dizzy
and couldn’t catch her breath. She didn’t
know what was wrong, but she believed it
was serious.

“I had never felt like that before,” Kash
said. “I felt like I was going to die.”

Through a series of extensive tests Kash
discovered she was suffering from panic
attacks -—— something she knew. nothing
about. A

She began to look for support groups
designed for people with her problem. ,

“I contacted everywhere I could think of,
and there was nothing,” Kash said.

That’s when she called the Self Help
Group Network. This network is an organi-
zation ‘designed to put individuals with
similar problems in touch with one anoth-
er. .
Its goal is to increase awareness of the
availability of self-help groups and to help
new groups to emerge.

“We reach out to people isolated in the
community,” said Betty Hepner, executive
director and founder of the network.
“Many people think they are the only ones
suffering from a problem and we try to link
them with others who can understand.”

Hepner has a master’s‘ in social work and
started the network in 1983. She is a full-
time volunteer and runs the office with
only one administrative assistant.

“It’s very much a grass roots operation,”
Hepner said. “We don’t need major fund-
ing or highly paid professionals.”

But the organization does rely heavily on
its volunteers and donations. The network
is a non-profit organization which covers
about 10 counties in Western
Pennsylvania. The only other self help
clearinghouse in the state is in Scranton
and only covers two counties. There are a
total of 67 counties in Pennsylvania.

Hepner said she is trying to get funds
from the state to form more clearinghous-
es, but nothing concrete has developed.

“We were very disappointed when
Governor Casey vetoed a bill which had
passed through the House and the Senate
last year,” Hepner said. «

In recent years, self-help groups have
greatly increased in the Pittsburgh area.
With the help of local sponsors, the net-
work has published five directories. In
1983, the directory listed 95 groups, in
1985, there were 125, and in 1987, it ended
up with 310 listings.

The network helps connect people with
groups concerning physical and sexual
abuse, drug and alcohol addiction, disabili-

The student who was hit by
a PAT bus Sept. 27 suffered a
foot injury but is expected to
return to classes soon.

“He is at home and recu-
perating and expects to
regain full use of his foot,”
said Pitt spokesperson Ken
Service.

The student underwent foot
surgery as a result of being
hit in the bus lane on Fifth
Avenue.

An investigation conducted
by Port Authority determined
that the driver was not at
fault.

The student was hit by the
right rear wheel of the bus.

“The witnesses say this guy
ran right into the back of the
bus,” said Staci Vernick _.
PAT spokesperson.

The student, who is an

Bosnian government ready for cease-fire

SARAJEVO — The Bosnian
government announced it was
ready for a cease—fire with the
Serbs within hours as gas and
electricity supplies flowed into
the city for the first time in six
months.

The cease-fire was delayed
24 hours but is now scheduled
to begin Tuesday at midnight.

Serbs agreed with impatience
to begin the cease—fire. There
has been heavy warfare in
northern and western Bosnia
this week and a NATO air
strike was launched against a
Bosnian Serb Army command
bunker. Reuters

BUDAPEST — Hungarian
Labor Minister Magda Kovacs
Kosa said yesterday that her
resignation was final "and
accused the government of
ignoring the social effects of its
harsh austerity package.

Kosa said after talks with
Prime Minister Gyula Horn
yesterday that she would stay
on until Nov. 30 to ensure con-
tinuity, but that her decision to
leave will not be swayed.

Her resignation followed a
cabinet meeting that accepted a
proposal to extend the number
of sick days to be paid to an
employee from 10 to 25 days in
order to slash state health
spending. Kosa proposed a

compromise of 15 days, argu-
ing that any more would force
employers into firing sick
employees due the cost of their
care. Reuters

SALFIT, West Bank — Israel
began its West Bank redeploy-

“PLO — lsrael no!" and waved
Palestinian flags outside the

the handover was being com-
pleted.

This action was the first step
of a peace deal sealed in
Washington last month to hand
over six occupied West Bank
Arab cities to the PLO and

Faculty Fellows ciflend
diversity seminor

Guest Is it possible to change the way we
C0]umnist teach and learn? Are faculty willing to
Ogle Duff expand their course syllabi? Are there

considerations that will inform us regard-
ing successful practices in diverse settings? Are there contents
in our disciplines that have been neglected or distorted?

The Curriculum on Campus Subcommittee of the
Chancellor’s Diversity Task Force, co—chaired by Professors
Marianne Novy and Ogle Burks Duff, was assigned the task of
exploring these issues during the 1993-94 year and of develop-
ing recommendations for the Task Force by the end of the
school year.

Other members of this committee were Ms. Yolanda
Campbell, Professor Laurence Howard and William Savage.
The number one recommendation from this committee stated,
‘The chancellor’s office should sponsor a series of seminars to
assist faculty to make their courses more inclusive in terms of
gender, race and other diversity issues both in content and in
pedagogy.” _

In the fall of 1994-95, the chancellor convened the Diversity
Working Group and directed the group to develop strategies for
implementing the recommendations made by the Diversity
Task Force. The co-chairs of the subcommittee put together a
faculty committee to plan and implement a faculty seminar on
more inclusive courses.

Members of the Faculty Seminar Planning Committee
included professors Jean Carr, Carol McAllister, Audrey
Murrell, Sharon Nelson-LeGall, Arthur Tuden and Special
Assistant to the Chancellor Nancy Washington.

Recruitment procedures were developed, a two-week pro-
gram of activities was
designed, and a budget
was prepared. Professors

“For the senior citizen living‘in Mon Valley?”

Some classroom aspects of the Internet will allow
distance-learning, giving children access to courses
and instructors that may otherwise be out of reach.
Harral said.

Delano Lewis, president and CEO of National
Public Radio, talked of a project that will link schools.
libraries and community centers. It's called Operation
Kickstart and will help to fulﬁll the educational goal of
“providing access to unlimited information to any stu-
dent with access to a computer.”

Lewis, the co-chair of the advisory council, said the
group has sketched out a blueprint for the project.

Other goals of the council include guarding against a
widening gap between the information haves and
have-nots. Exposing as many people as possible to the

information available depends on keeping access open.

“While not all families can afford or want a personal
computer. they can have access in some public venue."
Lewis said.

Groups and businesses must cooperate and forge
partnerships to develop software and hardware for the
network. Cooperation among volunteers. teachers and
librarians is also essential.

A Pennsylvania Information Highway Consortium
has been formed to help spread investments. under-
standing and cooperation across the state.

“The information is there.” Harral said. “It's easily
affordable and accessible. but we all owe it to our-
selves to find outmore about it.”

The NIIAC has pinned down funding options to
meet its goals. The cost seems to be within reach,
Harral said, and could possibly be met by state tax

credits. general obligation bonds or lotteries.

The council has also tried to sort through security
and privacy issues and stresses the importance of the
proper handling of personal and confidential interac-
tions over the network. Data integrity must also be
subject to public policy. Lewis said. This includes
accountability for intellectual property. child pomogra—
phy and defamation. ,

“There are many. many important questions. and
those questions are very complex.” he said.

The conference. which was held in the William Pitt
Union. preceded two days of meetings. yesterday and
today: was open to the public to further explore these
issues: and was coordinated by Dean Toni Carbo
Bearman of the School of Library and Information
Science. Bearman is the only representative from high-
er education on the national council.

Duff and Novy coordinated the seminar
with the assistance of Professor Murrell,
who functioned as a third coordinator.

Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor’s ofﬁce
provided $20,000 to fund this pilot activi-
ty. The seminar was further supported by
services and/or funds from the Women’s
Studies Department; the Ofﬁce of Faculty
Development Director, Laurie Richlin;
and school deans of the participating fac-
ulty: Kenneth Metz, Education; David
Epperson, Social Work; Peter Koehler,
FAS; May Briscoe, CAS; Donald
Mattison, GSPH; and David L. Dunlop,
vice president for academic affairs of Pit‘-
Johnstown. '

The recruitment process began in
January and ran for six weeks. Notices
were mailed to all deans on the main cam-
pus and the branch campuses which stated
that the chancellor’s office was underwrit-
ing a faculty seminar to address ways to
make the courses of faculty selected to
participate in the 10-day project more
inclusive.

Many inquiries were made, and 17 fac-
ulty officially applied. Ten were selected
based on criteria the plarming committee
had developed. Since the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences is the largest faculty group in
the university, the committee decided that
it would be the target group for the first
seminar. Consequently, half of the 10 slots

were designated for the arts and sciences
faculty. "~

A prototype for faculty seminars on
developing more inclusive courses was
implemented May 16-25. For two weeks
from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., 10 faculty fel-
lows went back to school. this time as stu-
dents instead of teachers. They were inten-
tionally engaged in solving a problem:
how to make their courses scholastically
more inclusive of race and gender.

Setting the tone for the seminar. Leith
Mullen. keynoter and professor of anthro-
pology at NYU, spoke.on the topic
“Contesting Boundaries: Race, Gender
and Curriculum Transformation.” Her pre-
sentation centered on new research on

race. gender and multiculturalism. The
faculty fellows had the opportunity to con-
fer with her alone: the keynote address.

From the beginning. the faculty fellows
expressed their concerns about having
their needs addressed for their course syl-
labi. Many opportunities existed for them
to share their views and to interact with
other fellows in the sessions. during
breaks and at lunch.

What seemed to have the greatest inﬂu-
ence on them was the chance to engage in
dialogue on content and pedagogical
issues. The main focus of the seminar was

e Hepner stresses the network is not a
substitute to professional or medical
support. _

“We provide a way to receive emo-
tional help,” Hepner said. f‘We provide
separate and unique support with no
cost to anybody.”

The network assists establishing self-
help groups by providing telephone ser-
vices and technical assistance to new
group leaders and by offering work-
shops. ’

“I contacted the network for pragmat-
ic reasons,” said Ben Dell, a coordinator
for Smart Recovery, a drug and alcohol

self-help group not based on a 12-step
program.

“We needed publicity and someone to
answer phones,” Dell said. “They have
provided a very valuable service for our
group.” .

With the encouragement from the net-
work, Kash decided to form a panic
attack group.

“Betty said I should start a group,”
Kash said. “I insisted I wasn’t the one to
talk to people.” ‘

According to Hepner, the network
receives the most calls from people who

need help with panic attacks and would'

benefit from the groups Kash helped to
form. .
There are several support groups

which meet on Pitt’s campus, said
Shirley Haberman, health education
administrator of Student Health Service.

“We used to run more self-help
groups, but they have been suspended,”
Haberman said.

This is due to the lack of resources
and funding for staff to run them.

Haberman estimated groups need to

meet at least twice a week and need two
facilitators. -

“We have to be careful how we use
the staff and the funding that we do
receive,” Haberman said.

An easy way to find out about self-

.help groups is through the blue pages

the syllabus which each partici-
pant was charged with modify-
ing to be more inclusive.
Therefore, the heated, healthy
discussions were most meaning-
ful because the ideas could be
immediately applied to their
task.

They had vested interest in
their own individual courses.
Each participant wanted to know
how best to expand or transform
his/her course. This urgency cre-.
ated the intensity and sustained
it through the last day.

Activities were structured to
provide an update on accessing
library, media and computer
resources. The university com-
munity was quite supportive of
this project and provided a cadre
of experts which included librar-
ians Adelaide Sukiennik, Pearl
Woolridge, Amy Knapp and
Lisa Mitten.

Julie DiBella introduced some
of the fellows to the Worldwide
Web and reviewed with others
its versatility. Michael Arenth
and others from Media Services
explained how their resources
could help in the classroom.
Carol Baker, director of the
office of measurement and eval-
uation of teaching, discussed
methods of evaluating teaching,
including course portfolios, peer
evaluations and OMET forms.

The extensive reading was rel-
evant and insightful on issues
and considerations in race and
gender. Some of the reading
which was highly valued by the
participants included Michael
Omi and Howard Winant’s
“Racial Formation in the United
States form 1960s to l980s” and
Paula Rothenberg’s “Integrating
the Study of Race, Gender, and
Class: Some Preliminary
Observations.” I

Finally, the consensus among
the faculty fellows was that the
seminar provided an invaluable
opportunity for interaction with
other faculty around the issues
of diversity and the improve-
ment of teaching. The most
highly rated aspect of the semi-
nar was the discussion of syllabi

‘ which occurred daily.

So. did we change the way we
teach and learn? Were faculty
fellows successful at expanding
their syllabi to be more inclu-

« sive‘? Based on the work done

by the fellows, their evaluations
and their revised or transformed
syllabi presented at the end, we
were. The next phase will be to
assess what the students learn
from these newly developed.
more inclusive courses.
Meanwhile, we are busy plan-
ning the 1996 Faculty Seminar
to be held in May.

can’t wear shorts unless you want to freeze to death. No, no,
this is far more important than any test could ever be to your
future. What is it, you ask? What have you forgotten about?

Homecoming elections.

Well. really, you couldn’t have possibly forgotten about it.
None of the candidates for king or queen would possibly let
you forget about it. By now the campus has already been
thoroughly plastered with signs imploring you to vote for him
or her or it for king or queen or serf. (even this early in the
game many of the signs have already even found their way to
their rightful place as doormat).

If you look very close at these signs all over campus, you
will notice that most of them carry the endorsement of some
Greek organization or another. Of course, the endorsements
are all pretty small (none of them are any more than 6 inches
high), so you’ll have to look pretty closely to see them.

Each of these signs also boasts the portrait of a human
jac.k-o-lantern, with huge grinning teeth and perfect hair.
Have you ever noticed none of these people look at all like
their pictures in real life? Maybe there should be a rule that
the pictures have to be taken when the candidate is just get-
ting out of bed in the morning.

You have to wonder what makes a person spend all the

' money (paper for signs and lollipops to pass’ out at voting

booths are not cheap, you know) and effort to be elected
homecoming king or queen. Ooohhh  that’s right, you get to
stand on the football field at halftime. Wow! What a thrill!

Whatever people manage to win the ‘prestige of being
homecoming king and queen have accomplished nothing
morethan winning a contest of which fraternity and sorority
is more popular. You remember way back when, in high
school, it always seemed like no one liked the homecoming
queen? It wasn’t the most popular person, it was the cheer-
leading captain or the gymnast. But whoever won in high
school, it gave everyone a reason to get dressed up, go to a
dance and stay out past curfew.'Being Homecoming king and
queen in a college serves no purpose whatsoever.’ We can
dress up and go out whenever we want to. Hell, you can wear
a gown or tux to class if you want. Curfew? What’s that?

The institution of Homecoming is a great concept. People
come back to Pittsburgh from all over the country to visit
their alma mater. Alumni and former staff members return
and contribute a lot of money to the university community,
and this kind of loyalty gives pride to everyone who gradu-
ates from this school.

But the fact of the matter is, college elections for a home-
coming king and queen are nothing more than Greek popular-
ity contests. Maybe it’s time we all grow up. What’s next,
prom queen?

No one said everyone has to agree

0 h n
Curlovic
h,anarts

columnist for

P l a rt e _t
Queer, last
year was

writing a
review of the
l e s b i a n
movie Even

Robert _ C .1 G
Chesnav1chT,‘:W<9‘” 3’

e Blues.
After trashing the movie, he
ﬁnished with a brief discussion
about the film’s queer director,
saying that perhaps he should
not have been allowed to come
out of the closet. While at the
time I ripped my hair out read-
ing this, I guess now I can
thank Mr. Curlovich for a great
anecdote to start my column
describing why I have not, and
at no time in the foreseeable
future will join any gay-rights
movement.

When I first realized that I
actually wasn’t straight but
rather bisexual some years ago,
I had the urge to join some
queer-rights group. I never got
the chance to, however, and
this is a good thing, because in
the years that passed, I began to
see many of the things for
which the gay-rights movement
stood, and saw more reasons to
stay away from it than to enter
1t. .

The ﬁrst on the list of reasons
is the issue of gay politics.
Gay-rights organizations, on
the whole, are liberals-only
clubs. The March On
Washington from March of
1993 is an excellent example of
this. Between 100,000 and 1
million marched, depending on
who you listen to. It might have
been more, however, had it not
been for the platform that these
individuals marched under.
Many issues had a connection
to gay rights that was either
loose or entirely nonexistent on
the‘ list of issues in this plat-
form. I

Abortion rights, for example,
was among the more loudly

argued items. Supporters
claimed that the right to privacy
is one that extends from the
abortion room to the bedroom,
but if this was such a universal-
ly agreed upon concept, then
gay pro-life groups would not
exist, when in fact they do.
Other issues were even more
out of left-ﬁeld: bilingual edu-
cation and prisoner’s rights, for
example. It is not because I
necessarily disagreed with
these issues that I was so
appalled (I am pro—choice, for
example.), but rather that they
were thrown under the umbrel-
la of gay rights, implying that
queers who didn’t support these
were bad queers. Unfortunately,
ask women who" actually like
Camille Paglia or blacks who
oppose affirmative action, and
you will find out that this back-
wards traitor-to-your-own-
cause psychology isn’t new.

A second reason has to do
with the acceptance (or lack
thereof) of bisexuals in the gay-
rights movement. Those of us
who lean in both directions
have often gotten the snub from
gays and lesbians, for a wide
variety of reasons. Probably,
the largest is the in-the-closet
factor. It is much easier for a
bisexual to stay in the closet
than it is a gay or lesbian; I can
walk down the street holding
my girlfriend’s hand, and I’m
not faking anything. While this
is an unfair advantage, it is also
unfair for gays to hold it against
bis — the “I hate you because
you can get away with some-
thing that I cannot” attitude is

. moronic.

A cousin of this belief is that
bisexuals are gays who don’t
want to give up their “hetero-
sexual privilege;” that bis are

not bi. While it is true that

many people jump all over the
sexuality scale before frne-tun-
ing themselves, it is amusing to
see gays tell other people what
it is they really want, when the
same psychology has been used
to push the idea that gays can
be “cured.” There are more rea-

sons than this, and though not
all groups or individuals are
biphobic, enough are to keep
me from feeling any sense of
teamwork.

The greatest reason I stay
away from gay-rights groups,
however, is a philosophy that
few of them would deny, even
though I am completely
opposed to it: gays, on the
whole, demand to be accepted
by society.

OK, perhaps it seems a bit
odd that I might oppose this, so
let me explain. What gays are
fighting for is the right to do
whatever they want with any
other consenting adult. I agree
with this concept entirely.
However, if we must push for
the right to love whomever we
want and not judge people for
their reasons, we must also
allow people to dislike or even
hate whomever they want, for
whatever reason, including
because they are gay. So when
the Boy Scouts were sued for
not letting gays into their
group, I was completely on the
side of the Boy Scouts. They
were fighting for the same
rights that gays have been
actively fighting for for
decades — the right to associ-
ate with whomever they want
for whatever reason they want
to. -
I don’t at all demand that
anyone like my bisexuality, or
that they condone it at all. You
can hate me all you want for
being bi, and I in response will
exercise my right of thinking
you a brainless twit. I demand
only the right to do what I want
with whomever so consents. As
soon as I see gay-rights move-
ments focus more on that and
less on other distractions, I’ll be
more quick to join. Until then, I
remain a largely unrepresented
bisexual Libertarian. '

Catch the

 was talk-
 ing to a
 riend last

1 week who
8 goes to the

  
 

I University of
Kentucky, and
       welgot on the
Columnist- subject of bas-
Brad ketball. She
Isles told me there
was some-
body waiting outside Rupp
Arena to get tickets for

Midnight Madness. They
weren’t waiting for tickets to a
game; they were waiting for
tickets to the ﬁrst (legal) practice
of the season.

Granted, the whole state of
Kentucky cares about three
things, in no particular order:
basketball, horse racing and
God. Pennsylvania and Pitt are
nowhere close to Kentucky in
hoops craziness. I doubt anyone
here would get in line 12 days
before any event, let alone get in
line for a basketball practice.

Midnight Madness was virtu-
ally bom in Kentucky and has
been adopted over the years by
colleges and universities across
the nation. Pitt started doing it
three years ago.

It has gotten so big that ESPN
broadcasts from some of the
major programs across the
country. Last year, a Cincinnatti
student received a one-year
scholarship for hitting a shot
from half-court. Dick Vitale
even bought his books.

Well, it isn’t necessary to risk
your life by camping out on the
hill. All you have to do is go to
the Field House this Saturday at
about 10:30 p.m.

This is the ﬁrst opportunity
for the public to witness the best
recruiting classes in the nation
and to win some cool prizes in
the process.

For the first time, there will be
a student dunk contest for the
men. Everyone out there who
grew up watching Michael go
up against Dominique has the
opportunity to dunk in front of
his peers. And, for the female
students, there is a hot shot con-
test. All you have to do to par-
ticipate is register between

10:30 and 10:45 p.m.

There’s also food, money and
prize giveaways. Who knows,
maybe you'll win a new car.

Then, at midnight, coaches
Kirk Bruce and Ralph Vlfrllard
will bring out the women’s and
men’s teams to show off their
new talent. -

This is what every Pitt basket
ball fan has been waiting for
since the end of last year’s Big
East Tournament. There is no
doubt the expectations are high
for this year’s team. Go to the
Field House Saturday night and
see what Midnight Madness is
all about —— Pitt style.

Crew compete

By Nichole Gantshar
Staff Writer

Three Rivers Stadium’s
parking lot was‘ filled with
rowing shells this past
Saturday as Pittsburgh hosted
the “Head of the Ohio” race.
The Pitt rowing club compet-
ed in nine of the 27 events
and medaled in women’s
pairs.

Other results included
men’s lightweight 8, sixth
place; women’s pair, third
place; men’s lightweight 4,
seventh place; women’s light-
weight 4, ninth place;
women’s club 4, sixth place;
men’s open 8, 11th place;
men’s open 4, 17th place.

Top racing schools with
long histories of crew and
varsity scholarship support,
such as Brown University,
were well represented and
showed well.

“We raced this morning so
it wasn’t too choppy. It went
pretty well for us,” said Pitt
rower Michelle Mielke. She
and her partner, Katie
Holland, also a senior, were

among the first medalists of.

the day.

Pittsburgh had a tent set up
on the river bank right next to
MITs tent. “Wow look at that
girl, she really got cut up,”
one rower said, looking at a

back of her calves. “You often
get cut when you stretch your
legs out on the drive,” said

Mielke.

Alumni, competitors, par-
ents and novice rowers who
were not in competition that
day all stood around the Pitt
tent. Jannine Markizon, Pitt
crew 1990-94, who now
coaches the Upper St. Clair
team, was just one alumni
who stopped by to say hello
to former teammates.

“Tonight is our first annual
alumni dinner, and we hope to
make it a tradition each year,”
said club president and senior
Julie Lambrou.

The Head of the Ohio also
hosted masters level races for
rowers over the age of 30.
The Pitt club has barely been
around long enough for alum-
ni to qualify for the race, but
Lambrou hoped to get alumni
back in boats on Sunday.

Two of the club's founders
were on hand for the race.

Peter Alprin and Richard
Zahrobsky helped to start the
club in 1987.

‘‘It’s exciting to see how
much the sport of rowing has
taken off. The first Head of
the Ohio, there were probably
20 college teams here,”
Zahrobsky said. “It’s amazing
that Pittsburgh has three
rivers and rowing hasn’t been
that big.”

ers when we started,” Alprin

Pitt hockey looks to repeat as champs

By Armando Roggio

For The Pitt News

“I’ll take 15 stitches for the champi-
onship anytime,” said the 6-foot-2, 200-
pound-plus defenseman as he sat tall and
straight at the table in Foster’s Restaurant.

He was smiling a lot, displaying the
spearing scar on his chin. He wore it like
a trophy. You could tell he liked talking
about hockey. Afterall, he is a champ.

president, is in fact just one of the retum-'

Association Champions who plan to win

For The Pitt News

Mario is back. Mario is back. These

are the three words the Pittsburgh _

Penguins have used to strike fear into
the hearts of players around the league.
With the likes of Jaromir Jagr and Petr
Nedved, every NHL team should be
afraid. Pittsburgh General Manager
Craig Patrick made several off-season
moves, including trading away super-
stars Kevin Stevens, Luc Robitaille and
A Ulf Samuelsson.

Fortunately for Lemieux. the captain
has a much younger cast of forwards to
surround him in his journey for a third
Stanley Cup. With Jagr (23), center Petr
Nedved (21), right winger Glen Murray
(22) and off-season acquisition Bryan

 

the title for a second consecutive year.
White (“Lumpy” to his friends and
“Freight Train” to those" he helps to the
ice) said he believes that Pitt’s hockey
team has a great chance for back—to—back
titles. Nearly all of last year’s champi-
onship team will return this season.

“Considering the talent that is coming
back, I definitely think we are going to
win this year,” said right wing Chris
Bickell.

For example, Billy Elliot is back as
center iceman of what amounts to this
unselfish team’s first line. Elliot, who was
once drafted by the International Hockey

Smolinski (23), Pittsburgh should have
an easy time running away with the
division.

The reason the Penguins won’t is
defense —-— or the lack thereof. Their
defense barely goes deeper than 25-
year-old defenseman Sergei Zubov.
Zubov, from Moscow, Russia, scored 36
points in 38 games last season with the
Rangers. Returning for Pittsburgh is
veteran Norm Maciver and fellow thugs
Francois Leroux and Chris Tamer. The
two enforcers amounted 196 penalty
minutes last season. i

If Lemieux can stay healthy, the sky’s
the limit for Pittsburgh. As for the rest
of the Northeast: be very scared. Mario
is back. ' v

The health and endurance of Ray
Bourque will again be put to the test

League’s Indianapolis Ice, can be counted
on for high—powered offense.

“Billy Elliot is our most prolific scorer.
And he was the league MVP last year,”
White said.

Also returning are forwards Carter
Leonards and Travis Wills. “They work
so well together,” said White. “Leonards

is an opportunistic hitter. I don’t think he a

looks for hits, but he hits like [Eric]

Another returnee from last year’s squad
is Dan Glynn. “Glynn is much improved

from last year. He’s playing with much

Mario puts Pens on top of Northeast Division

when the Boston Bruins take to the ice.
The 35-year-old captain, who is enter-
ing his 17th season, expected a reduc-
tion in minutes per game this season.
However, Al Iafrate’s timetable looks as
if he’ll be out for a while longer.
Although the Bruins do have future
stars in 6-foot-2, 200-pound Jamie
Huscroft and American—born John
Gruden, the pressure will ultimately be
put on Bourque to guide these individu-
als through the season.

Newly acquired Kevin Stevens and
Shawn McEachern should provide a
much needed spark to this offensive-
minded hockey club. Even at 30,
Stevens will get his second wind on a
line with Adam Oates and Cam Neely.

more conﬁdence,” White said.

Center Steve Fisher will be back to provide
leadership and consistency. White described
him as the team’s Ron Francis. “He’s our utili-
ty player,” White said.

And fifth—year returning veteran defenseman,
Kenny Anderson, who “has a great slap shot,”
according to White, and scored seven goals
last year, can be expected to produce solid
defense and a few scoring chances for the other
guys. _

Goaltender Pat Kenny, who defended P1tt’s
net for all but the end of last year’s final game,
is back. “Pat Kenny is really very quick,”
White said. “He’s not big, but he’s a real good
goaltender. I see him leading us back to the
championship.”

“Big guy, good player, quick skater,” White
said of Bickell, who will also be back. So will
defenseman Shawn Goldstien and champi-
onship veterans Chris Farrell and Pete
Reitmeyer.

Retumee Brad Rizzo is “one of the best play-

ers l’ve ever seen; one of the most talented
players l’ve ever seen —— a Paul Coffey kind of
player,” White said.

Yet, perhaps even more important to the team
is the return of volunteer coach Dick Rizzo Sr.
“He’s the best, honest to God,” Reitmeyer said.

“There was a real difference when the coach
took over last year,” Anderson said.

“He’s the best coach I ever had, and l’ve had
a bunch,” White said. “He only wants you to
do your best. He gets so into the games.”

White said coach Rizzo doesn’t get paid and
regularly pays out of his own pocket for the
team.

Returning players are not the only reason Pitt
expects to compete for another championship
year. The truth is that the hockey team is not so
much about each player, as about team.

“I don’t think anyone is looking for individ-
ual glory.” White said.

“Everyone is a team player,” Elliot said.
“Everyone helps each other.”

“At the end of last year, you should have
seen us. We just clicked,” White said. “We
were a cohesive unit.”

goals and 14 assists in the
l99_5 season, is due for a
breakout year. The addition
of Todd Elik, who left St.
Louis over the summer, will
provide Boston with more
help up the middle.

The future looks bright _

between the pipes for Boston
as well. Second year “brick
wall” Blaine Lacher played
on his head last year, going
(19-ll-2) with a 2.41 goals
against average. As for the
‘95 playoffs, chalk it up to
experience. Backing up
Lacher are two solid veteran
goaltenders in Vincent
Riendeau and Craig
Billington. Barring injuries,
goaltending will be an asset
to the Bruins.

Making the playoffs should
no longer be a reach for the
Hartford Whalers.
Swapping defense for
offense was well worth the
risk in sending future star
Chris Pronger to the St.
Louis Blues for 26-year-old
scoring machine Brendan
Shanahan. The new Whaler
captain can get rough with
opposing teams as well. Last
season, he amassed 136
penalty minutes to go along
with his 41 points.

In addition to Shanahan,
Hartford has plenty of punch
up the middle and on the
wings. Centers Jimmy
Carson, Andrew Cassels and
tough guy Mark Janssens are
all returning, as well as left
winger Geoff Sanderson and
right wingman Steven Rice.
Moreover, the blue and
green acquired more help
last Saturday when they trad-
ed center Darren Turcotte for
Winnipeg winger Nelson
Emerson. Emerson scored 14
goals and 23 assists in 48
games last season.

Like Hartford, things can
only get better for the
Montreal Canadiens. The
Habs missed the playoffs last
season for the first time in
25 years. Head coach Jaques
Demers hopes they can
rebound from their horrid (3-
18-3) road record and he
can get his boys back in the
playoff hunt.

It’s a mystery why this
team can’t produce big num-
bers. The first line of Pierre

Turgeon,Vincent_

Damphousse and Mark
Recchi should light it up this
season.

Additionally, Montreal
hopes Saku Koivu can turn
some heads in his rookie
year.
Finnish native scored 27

The 20-year-old .

goals and assisted on 47 oth-
ers in the minors last season.

How many years does net-
minder Patrick Roy have left
in him? The 11-year veteran,
under his terms, came off a
subpar season with a 2.97
goals against average and a
90.6 save percentage. That's
good on most squads. If the
six-time all-star and three-
time Vezina trophy winner
can put last season’s memo-
ries behind him. the
Canadiens should have no
trouble grabbing a playoff
spot.

One cannot say the same
for the Buffalo Sabres, how-
ever. The Sabres began
dumping salaries last season
when they traded all-star
Alexander Mogilny to
Vancouver. Moreover,
Buffalo let veteran Dale
Hawerchuk skip town to join
Mike Keenan and the St.
Louis Blues. With the direc-
tion this Buffalo squad is
headed, first—year head coach
Ted Nolan will be running a
team of rookies by season’s
end.

Good defense and goaltend-
ing can carry a team through
the playoffs. Unfortunately,
it can’t always get you into
the playoffs. The Sabres lost
one of their few good for-
wards in Donald Audette for
a month to injuries. Captain
Pat LaFontaine and winger
Yuri Khymlev can only carry
this Sabre offense so far.

The same goes for goal-
tender Dominik Hasek. Last
year’s Vezina trophy winner
led the league in goals
against (2.11) and save per-
centage (93%). This season,
though. will be a tough test
for the Dominator. With a
solid, but aging, defense,
things do not look good for
Buffalo.

If Buffalo’s chances are
bad, the Ottawa Senators
are totally out of luck.
Superstar Alexei Yashin left
Ottawa for Russia last week
over contract disputes, vow-
ing “never to play for the
Senators again.” Can we
blame him? The Senators
have promise, but then
again, they’ve had that since
they entered the league.
Ottawa will remain the
Eastern Conference doormat
for yet another season.

While the Senators struggle
at the bottom, the race to the
top of the Northeast will
come down to Boston and
Pittsburgh. A healthy
Lemieux will give "the
Penguins a division crown
and a lock for the Eastern
Conference Finals.

Canadian team finished sev-
eral boat lengths ahead of the
U.S. boat, making it appear
that the two teams were not
equally matched.

“The hard part of a race is
you don’t know how you fin- A

,1 ished,” said Lambrou. Much
‘ of the day was spent waiting
i for scores. Except for sprints,
I most of the races were “head”
i races that start boats at 10-
second intervals.

As the day progressed,
some‘ problems developed.
“We waited in the water for
an hour because they had
trouble getting boats in the
water,” said Jeff‘ Maurin, who

Pl competed in the open fours. -

“There were only three

i boats in the water, and we

thought, ‘Cool. here’s the.
gold. silver and bronze.’

Then 20 other boats showed
up.” Murin and his team-

mates finished 17th. They

lost the wheels on the bow’s

seat and had to row in with
three men.

During the middle of the
day the water was very rough,
and strong wind kept boats
from making the type of.
progress race organizers had
expected along the three—mile
course.

“Ideally, we’d like flat

water, but it wasn’t bad,”
Lambrou said.
Yet the delays caused the
race, scheduled to end at 2
p.m., to go past 4:30 p.m.

While there were not a lot

‘ Canadian National Team was R.
‘ 4

Gateway Clipper Partytiner   
    October 21, 1995 

of medals at Head of Ohio for
Pitt, the team was glad for the

chance to compete this early I

in the season. When they do

set goals for the season. the

rowers don’t cons-ider times.
“Times don’t matter much,”

- said former crew member

Matt Bunce, explaining that

water conditions and wind ’

vastly impact results. Bunce

‘said that it’s “beating other

schools” that really counts.
“Rivalries — that’s the
main thing  pass one or two
boats,” Mielke said.
“We have a very young
team.” said Lambrou. “and
that may be our strength.

Next year we’re ‘going to see
__ a lot of victories.”
