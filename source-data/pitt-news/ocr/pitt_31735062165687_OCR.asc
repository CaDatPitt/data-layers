Programmed Thought Taught

Skinner Explains

Machine Teaching

By J0 NELSON
An enourmous crowd streamed into the S.U. Ballroom

last Wednesday to hear the renouned psychologist, Dr. ‘B. F.

‘Skinner, speak at the Midday Series. The crowd was re-

iwarded byfan interesting and timely resume of teaching
‘machines, their beginning, use, and future.

Dr. Skinner began by saying that there isa great need

“Any idea or in-
this
problem is likely to be seized upon
before it is even ready,” he went
on

for education.

An indication of this is that
even the -most critical publisher
will welcome a program textbook
with open arms._ Those in the
ﬁeld of computer technology and
gadgeteers have a proﬁtable fu-
ture assured them, according to
Dr. Skinner.
University Beginnings

“The teaching machine,” said
Dr. Skinner, “had its beginnings
at this University.” Teaching ma-
chines were ﬁrst formally intro-
duced during a lecture given here
several years ago on the science

of learning and the future of
teaching.
Dr. Skinner deﬁned the

teaching machines as self-test-
ing machines which require
some previous knowledge of the
material. The machines allow
the student to learn at his own
rate and operate under the prin-
ciple that one learns by being
consistently right, he said. ‘
The machines are constructed
with a small, oblong box on the
front through which the student
sees a sentence with a blank for
which he must attempt to pro-
vide the correct answer. If he
fails, additional material is shown
in another window until he can
answer correctly.
Many Advantages
The advantages of teaching ma-

showing actual solutions to prob-
lems rather than through the trial
and error process.

Dr. Skinner warned that one

cannot just look at himself and
devise a teaching machine around
his own learning capabilities. A
successful machine must involve
an effective basic analysis of be-
havior. “These machines can be
devised to be much like a teach-
er,” he addcd, “including the
committing of typical hum’:an mis-

Air Pollution
Study Gets
US Support

Research on the problem of
air pollution has been ex-
panded at the University.

Five fellowships supported
by a training grant from the
U.S. Public Health Service

have been instituted and two ap-
pointments in the Department of
Public Health Practice have been
made. _
The fellowships lead to the de-
gree of Master of Science in Hy-
giene. Post—graduate .students 're—
ceive $300 per -month stipends,
and post—M.S. students receive
$330 per month stipends, plus $30
a month allowances for each de-
pendent and free tuition and fees.

Corn Appointed

Dr. Morton Corn has been ap-
pointed assistant professor in the
Department of Public Health
Practice. In May Felix Stein, an
research specialist,
will join Dr. Corn as research
associate.

The new air pollution re-
search program, according to
Dr. Corn, will first work. on ad-
hesion of fine particles to solid
surfaces. He called this subject
important to the design of par-
ticulate sampling and collection
apparatus. '

A second ‘project will involve
light scattering and transmission
of aeresols. They relate to the
problem of atmospheric visibility.

Expressed Hope

done in the future would utilize
scientiﬁc workers of different dis-
cip1ines,- who would focus their
efforts on the broad areas con-
cerning the effects of polluted at-
mospheres on man and other
forms of life. -

Union, New York City; and of

University students did ex-
tremely well on the nation-
wide Carroll achievement
test in Chinese given last
April and May, it has been
announced. _ ‘

Students from 29 leading Amer-
ican colleges and universities par-
ticipated. These institutions in-
cluded Harvard, ,Yale, Princeton,

Stanford, and the University of

Michigan.

The basic part of the Carroll
test, sponsored by the Modern
Language Association of America,
was the .Pictoral Auditory Com-
prehension Test.

Perfect Score

It had a perfect score of 75,
with a national median of 38 for
first-year students. Of the Uni-
versity students who took the test
(all of ‘them ﬂrst year), none
scored worse than 41. The best
mark was 57, making the Univer-
sity the only one to place all its
students above the national med-
ian. The_next highest university
placed only 85% of_ its students
above the median.

letter to Dr. VVen-djang Chu, as-
professor of Chinese
language at the University.
Professor Mills wrote: “May I
congratulate you on the excellent
performance of your class. You

‘had somehow managed to teach‘

all the students so well that none
came below the national median.
Although some schools had higher
medians, none had a higher per-
centage above the median . . . No
doubt your success with last
year’s class has been an important
factor in the spectacular rise in
your enrollment this year . . .”

Enrollment Tripled ,
According to D1‘. Y. T. Wang,
director of the Universit_y’s Chi-
nese Language and Area Center,
the enrollment of students in 'C~hi-
nese courses has tripled this year“;-_
The Center is planning further
expansion and next spring“ will
add an intensive reading program
to the original courses. The best

University, leaving its use to the
discretion of the University. Lewis
L. Doughton, Pittsburgh’s group
manager for Sears, presented the
gift to Chancellor Litchﬁeld.

The University is one of 557
colleges receiving Sears grants
totalling $900,000. 41 Pennsyl-
vania colleges have received
grants totaling $103,000.

Doughton expressed the view
that “corporate giving to higher

Letters to the Editor

Theater 11 Ticket

Shortage Criticized
Editor, The Pitt News

University’s Theater II from

‘time to time presents plays for

‘the University students, the last
being “Dog in the Manger.” An-
nouncements that tickets are
available .appear in The Pitt
News, but every time I, have
gone to obtain’ them I have been
told that no more tickets are

_, available.

I think that if there is more
demand for seats by the students
to see these performances,
plays can be run for longer

. periods so that all have an op-
-portunity to see them.‘ Failing
that, the play could be moved
to a larger auditorium such as
Stephen ‘Foster Memorial Hall

‘ where ‘more seats are available.

-Once ajfriend ‘told me even

A before the story appeared in“ the’

newspaper that Theater II was
going to have a» play the fol-
lowing ‘week, and even then I
received the same answer. This
leads me to believe that the
seats are sent to administration
and faculty members even be-

fore the announcement is made .
_~and the students are unable to

obtain the tickets.

Some of the members of the
castmay be even getting the
tickets for their friends and
families so the general student
body can not see the plays.

‘Either we should 'not be

the ~

. ,1 ‘
tempted with the long reports of
the coming attractions
Pitt News or we should be able
to see them.

As the latter does not seem
to be true, I would request that
weinot be deluged with -infor-
mation about the Theater II
presentations in the future and
that the valuable space be de-
voted to information and news
about other happenings on the
campus. '

I would urge the Editor of
The Pitt News himself to look
into the affair of the tickets and

inform the student body about

his ﬁndings.

The Notweii Report .

Pride in i Prejudice

in The ‘

'It’s a "little store, with‘ a little I

Last year an unprecedented meeting took place
in a small American town, the name of which we
are not at liberty to divulge. Many times during
the past few decades different American industries
and -institutions have felt ‘the
need to call their leaders to- ,
gether and discuss far-reaching,
proposals that could modernize
their endeavors. In another of
this type, the men who lead
prejudice were convened .by
George Lincoln Notwell to see *
whether or -not prejudice in our.
country has kept up"with the
times. ,

We recently‘ recorded a frag-'
ment of the ofﬁcial minutesiof .
that meeting, and it is reproduced below:

Notwell: (Pounding table‘with his gavel.)
Gentlemen and ladies, your attention, please!
(Conversation continues, so he yells) Will “every-

one eaccept Communists, Jews, Negroes, and Cath- _

olics shut 'up!! (Silence) Now, we are meeting here
today to look at the deplorable condition of pre-
judice -in the United States. All of you have ‘come
because you believe as I do that the effectiveness
of prejudice is at its lowest ebb today, and I know
that you are more than ready to do something
about it. ’

(Applause and loud yells. Good-humored

‘laughter as one man in a sheet and pillow case

who has forgotten to cut out eyeholes runs into,
a tree.)

Notwell: Since we all agreed that the situation
is not to our liking, our next step_m_ust be to find
out why this is_ so and what can be done,’ Four
months ago I commissioned a public opinion sur-
vey institute’ to find out these answers. _

(More applause.’ Further commotion as a, ban
of segregationists lynch ,a Negroianti-Semite who
had pushed an anti-Catholic‘. Jew) ,

Notweli: And so, it isrny 'pri'vilege‘to- intro-
:luce to, you Mr.
Smith._ Mr. ' Smith. , . p p

(Respectful silence as Smith, clutching-a char-
coal grey folder, mounts the podium. He is tall and
thin. His eyes are weak and ‘he is actually almost

V bald but, fearing to be classed as, an intellectual,
' he wearscontact lenses and ,a toupeefsrriith takes,
some papers out of the folder, shuffles‘ thrioughi

them ‘for ‘a moment, then looks out at the audience
and begins.

' Smith: A few years‘ back, I was employed by a_

sales had dropped. Some research soon indicated
that the entire paper clip industry was suffering.
People were _used to them, expected to ﬁnd them
around the house, never thought of buying them.
They A wanted something different. They began
using chewing gum. I\showed the company my re-

sults and they went into the chewing gum busi-_-

ness. Now very successful. At the time, I had"
believed that this boredom with the overly famil-
iar_ might be a disease which could sweep this
country. I A

(Crowd “ooh’s” and “ah’s,” some evidentallyv
understanding Smith's line of reasoning.)

Smith: Therefore, I was not: surprised, my
friends, when I found prejudice; in America stag-
gering under the same disease‘!

(He, pauses. The crowd, as one, holds its

breath.) . -"f"

Smith: My survey has- shown conclusively that
Americans are -rapidly tiring of our present stand-
ards for hatred; Skin color, race,'religion, ultra-
liberalism have all become common place to a

great many of us.,We’re’not hating as well as we»

-usedto. Yes, and there is onlyﬂone answer to this
dilemma. If I am correct, this country "is ripe, for
new waves ofrhatred to sweepiover it. If you peo-
ple want to be the ‘leaders, you'must ﬁnd new

"channels for the people’s hatred, new standards._,,.-. 

for prejudice! - 7

(He steps down. to thunderous applause,i_and
Notwell‘ takes the stand). _

Notwell: I believe Smith is right, and even I
am readymtoichiange, to -moveiforward, to find new
things to hate. Areyou: ready tojoin me, to search“
with me for new "standards for prejudice?

(Emotion-packed cries of “yes! yesl”‘reverber-.

ate "across the meeting. place.) V V ..
Notwell: ‘Here then, are some ideas. Take them

homewitli you, try them out, improvise. ’We rriustL_,
be ingenious and resourceful. Height, weight, e5'e~7* pji

color, shoe size, voice tone —- all or one of. these

'may'indicate real inferiority. Work with__r_ne to,

ﬁnd out. Let us be ready to lead the new hatreds
when they come! ' - r _
(Wild applause, followed by conversation as

~members disburse, happily discussing their al-
‘ready half-formulated plans.) ' '

nex Laplan(l—in all fifty-two. This talk about annexing Wales
and Lapland is, incidentally, not just idle speculation. Great
Britain wants to trade Wales to the United States for a desert.
Great Britain needs a desert desperately on account of the
tourist trade. Tourists are always coming up to the Prime
Minister or the Lord Privy Seal or like that and saying, ‘"‘I’m
not knocking your country, mind you. _It’s very quaint and

picturesque, etc. what with Buckingham Palace and Bovril _

and Scotland Yard, etc., but where’s your desert?” (Before I
forget, let me point out that Scotland Ya.rd,~Brita.in’s plain.-
clothes police branch, was named after~VVally Scotland and

Fred Yard who invented plain clothes- The American plain- A

clothes force is called the FBI after l.4‘ra.nk B. Inchcliﬁ’, who
invented fingerprints. Before Mr. InchclitT’s invention, every-
body’s fingers were absolutely glassy smooth. This, as you
may imagine, played hob with the identiﬁcation of newborn
babies in hospitals. From 1791 until 1904 no American parent

 

 

 

ever brought home the right baby from the hospital. This
later became known as the Black Tom Explosion.)

But I digress. England, I was saying, wants to trade Wales
for a desert. Sweden wants to trade Lapland for Frank B. Inch-

clifl’. The reason is that Swedes to this day still don’t' have -

ﬁngerprints. As a result, identiﬁcation of babies in Swedish
hospitals is so haphazard that Swedes flatly refuse to bring their
babies home. There are, at present, nearly a half-billion un-
claimed babies in Swedish h0spitals-some of them well over
eighty years old. ‘

But I digress. VVe were speaking of Christmas gifts which
naturally put us in mind of Marlboro cigarettes. What could
be more welcome at (llwistnias time than Marlboro’s flavor,
l\‘la1'lboro’% soft pack, i\l:1rlboro’s flip—top box? What indeed
would be more welcome at any time of ye-.1r—winter or sum-
mer, rain or shine, night or day‘? Any time, any season, when
you light a Marlboro you can always be certain that you will
get the same mild, flavorful, completely comfortable smoke.

There are, of course, other things you can give for (‘,7hrist.mas
besides Marlboro cigarettes. If, for example, you are looking
for something to give a music lover, let me call to your atten-
tion a revolutionary new development in pl1om)graplis—-the
I.ow-ﬁ phonograph. The Low-ﬁ, product of years of patient
research, has so little. ﬁdelity to the record you put on it that if,
for instance, you put “Stardust” on the turntable, “Melancholy
Baby” will come out. This is an especially welcome gift for
people who have grown tired of “Stardust”.

Informal Songfest

   

Gateway ,TrioPerf0rms
at P. M. Series

By JANIES JANIS

Last Thursday night, the
P.M. Series presented Vivien
Richman and the Gateway
Trio in the lower lounge of
the Student Union. The Gate-
way Trio is composed of Mrs.
Richman, guitar
Davidson, banjo and guitar, and
Chuck Cubelic, bass. .

Before the concert started, Mrs.
Richman told me that the group
makes all of its own arrangements
which arise spontaneously during
their rehearsals. The most import-
ant part oftheir songs, according
to Mrs. Richman, is their original
quality, a middle ground between

‘the authentic, or ethnic origins of

songs, and the commercial atti-
tude taken by the Kingston Trio,
for example.

Mrs. Richman also told_me that
the group tries to express the
“real meaning of the words of a

, particular song, not just a melody

with words attached.” In my esti-
mation, they accomplish this per-
sonal. attitude very well in their
enthusiastic singing.
Informal Setting

The setting of the concert was
informal, as it should be for a
folksinging program. I’ve never
heard most of the songs theysang,

although a few were borrowed‘

from the Kingston Trio and Peter,
Pam: and Mary.

The concert was divided". into
two parts, with the ‘second half
being better than the first. One
of the best songs of the evening,
however, was the Russian Gypsy
song, “Ty Pastoy,”, a solo by
Mrs. Richman during the first
half.

Mrs. Richman’s voice is gen-
erally classiﬁedas contralto, al-
though she told me that she sang
with the tenors while she was in
the Pitt Chorus. Her voice is ex-
tremely clear, with a unique per-
’sonal element which is unusual
among modern female vocalists.

Trio Excels . A

The T_rio excels in nationality
songs, but falls short of other
groups_ in songs such as
Howard’s Dead and Gone.” This
is a Kingston Trio song, and they
did notising it as well as the
Kingston Trio does.

However, the Russian love
songs, the Irish drinking songs,
and the Yiddish ballads were
handled extremely well. The

and lead, Jo-

“Old ,

VVIE RICHMA

AND COMPANY

Originality in Spontaneity

best song of the evening was
“Hine Ma Tov,” a contemporary
Yiddish ballad with the words
taken from Psalm 132. The bar-
‘mony in this ballad was better
than ‘in any other song of the
evening.

All three members of the Trio
showed proﬁciency in the use of
their instruments, especially Jo
Davidson with the banjo. Mr.
Davidson, a tenor-baritone, also
sang a number of solos, the best
of which was “Pretty .Polly,” an
American ballad.

Performed Medley

During the second half, the Trio
did a medley of Folk Carols con-
sisting of a Calypso and a Negro
ballad, and the familiar “Chil-
dren, Go where I Send Thee.”

In all of the arrangements,
Mrs. Richman was the out-
standing performer. She has. a
certain professional talent that
the other two members lack.
Although all three are good,
Mrs. Richman is better than
either of the other two.

In conclusion, I enjoyed the
concert and considered the eve-
ning pleasant and entertaining.
The thing which I especially liked
was the tone in which the concert
was given. It was not too loud, as
were some other concerts I have
heard, yet it was not too soft. I
think Vivien Richman and the

WHAT EVERHAPPENED TO LOU SLABY?

Lou Slaby is a hulking 6-foot 3-inch, slab of beef who
earned. the No. 1 fullback position in the latter part ‘of
his sophomore year and lost it when Rick Leeson came along.

He didn’t even earn a letter this year; didn’t even play
a full hour of football for the Panthers. Yet the New York
Giants of_ NFL drafted him in the third round. ' A

A lot of people wonder why. We called Wellington
Mara Jr., who heads" the Giant’s scouting program, to
ﬁnd the answer. Mara said theteam based its judgment
strictly on the high reports that they received on Slaby
on his performancein spring training two seasons ago.

“He didn’t play much this year,” Mara said, “We went
back to the promise we
thought he had shown earlier.

“He’s big and strong and
we think we have apchanceto -
develop him. With added
maturity" and the added op-
portunity to play at one posi-
tion, we think" he’ll show -
great promise.” ‘
Top Linebacker .

Contrary to written reports,
Mara thought this year’s col-
lege crop was a "good one.-
“There were more -good line-
men than backs,” n he said,
“but there weren’t too many
linebackers. Lou is as im- 
top two or,  -
in the

   

three linebackers ' Loud Slaby

country. _ _ 

“Lou has a big frame, aframe capable "of carrying

even more weight. We recognize that Leeson is a: fine

fullback. We’re interestefd in ‘Slaby primarily {orde-
fense. The Penn State people spoke hig"hly of him.”

Coach Jim Lee‘ Howell,‘ the" -former head man’ of the"

Giants, spoke to‘Slaby.a week ago, and Lou indicated he will
sign. V
b If the pro Giants are so interested- in Slaby, how come
he didn’t‘ see much action here? ‘T
“We’re not interested in feeding the pros,” said ‘assistant
coach Carl DePasqua, who "handlesl_t,he defensive secondary.
“We’r_e not training kids toigraduate -into‘ the pro ranks‘.
HavefTo Go Both Ways , _— , i ‘
‘‘We-have, to consider how akid ‘can go both ways. We
have to go. on performance_ on the field. Lou’s a"big, strong
kid;.that’S Why_;they’re interestedin him.” _ .

De Pasqua pointed -out‘ that. Slaby‘ was supposed to see
heavy duty with the ‘Headhunters, the ill-fated defensive
unit. “They never came through for us and we had to dis-
band them. It‘ hurt Lou’s playing time.” ,

DePasqua asserted. “To me, Lou’s_ an engineer. He’ll_

"make. a very ﬁne engineer someday. What a kid does

four years after he’s out of here is what’s important to us.

If he plays pro ball that doesn’t do us a bit of’ good.

That’s‘ no selling point for the school when you’re re-

cruiting. ‘ ” v ‘ _ . . __

“Besides this isn’t newsworthy unless Lou makes the

‘ pros. Look how many of our guys were drafted last year

and didn’t makeit.”
“They’re always willing to take a chance on a big
kid like that,” opined Ernie Hefferle, who was an assist-
ant for the Washington Redskins a few seasons ago.
“Personally, I hope Lou makes it. He’s a good boy.”

“The other coaches don’t” blurted press. agent vBeano
Cook. “It comes back at them; makes them look bad for not
using him.” -

DePasqua ﬁxed glaring eyes on Beano and scowled,
What the hell are you talking about? You don’t work with a
kid every day and wish something bad on him.”

So Lou Slaby seems headedfor the Giants. DePasqua
concluded, “He must be contemplating that Sam Huﬁ’ is
going to retire.”

Lifchfield Wonderinq , '

Chancellor Litchﬁeld didn’t sound too assured that Joh
Michelosen will be back to coach the football team come
next fall when he was interviewed on TV recently.~

He said the coaching staff hadn’t been appraised yet,
and explained that Michelosen doesn’t have a life—time con-
tract which laymen think he has.

tenbach, the captain ‘of the _foot_hall team, tospread

Rex Peery Searches
For Small Wrestlers

By BOB SMIZIK
Wrestling Coach Rex ‘Peery has long been conﬁdent of

victory in the lower weight

classes. The little men have

always looked big on the scorecard. ,
This year, however, Peery must ﬁnd some new light-

weight grapplers to follow the likes of such former stalwarts

as Larry Lauchle, Rich Martin, John Zolikoff and Daryl

Kelvington.

He should have no problem in
the 123-pound class where Mike
Johnson, an undefeated high
school wrestler (record 84-0),
ranks ﬁrst. Johnson ﬁnished sec-
ond in last year’s Wilkes Tourna-
ment to Martin, losing by a mere
point.

At the 130, 137 and 147-pound
classes the outlook is not as good.
Sophomore Tom Heniff and sen-
ior Dave Osmun are the leading
candidates at 130, with Don Cas-
low in contention.

None of the three will give
the team a consistent winner
like Lauchle was, but they
should do as well as Sherm
Moyer did last year.

Tom Baily has the best shot at
grabbing the 137 pound starting
job, with Bill Solominsky being

his stiifest challenge.

147 Weakest

The 147 pound class looms as
the weakest spot on the team,
especially with Paul Wilson out
indeﬁnitely. Frank O’Korn looks
like the starter here although
Solominsky could move up and
give him trouble.

If Osmun doesn't make the
starting lineup then there will

~ not be a wrestler with any var-

sity experience in the first four
spots.

In the upper weights the out-
look is better although there are
more problems than usually occur
on a Pitt wrestling team.

No Heavyweight

The main source of trouble
stems from the fact that there
is_ no heavyweight out for the

team. Jeff Ware, last year’s
heavyweight, has yet to draw
equipment. ’

Without Ware, the heavy-
weight duties will fall either to
Ken Barr of Lee Hall, both
normal l77—pounders. Hall, an-
other of the ﬁne sophomore-
prospects, has beaten Barr in
practice and if this continues
Barr will wrestle heavyweight
and Hall at 191 pounds.

Peery can use Jim Harrison, a
third place ﬁnisher in the NCAA
tournament last year, at either
167 or 177 pounds.

Sophomores John Carr and Tim
Gay will probably handle the
other two positions with the loser
in the team’s elimination at 157
pounds handling the heavier
weight and the winner doing the
wrestling at 157 pounds.

Depth Due
F or Gymnasts;
Five Vets Back

By AL BLUIVIKIN

“Depth on apparatus will
be the strongest feature of
our team this season”, com-
mented Earl McConnell, as-
sistant coach of the gmynas—
tics team, “We have some
really good boys on the horses
and parallels
this year.” Mc-
Connell, an ;
All - American
last year for
t h e Panthers,
assumed com-
mand of the
team for a few;
days in ther-
place of Coach
Vlfarren Neiger,
who was ill.

‘The depth on
theapparatus has been demon-
strated in the daily workouts. On
the long horse, the Panther con-
tingent is headed by veterans. Bob
Pingatore and Ed Zamecnik.

Pingatore was one of the top

 

men in the east in this event last‘

year. Zamecnik’s specialty is the

horizontal bar, but he also was_

second man in the long horse in
most of the meets -last year.

Horses Improve ,
Theside horse situation is also
improved over last
year. Roland James, -a junior, is
the key man in this event. He
compiled two ﬁrsts and four sec-
onds in the eight meets and ap-
pears to have overcome his nerv-
ousness. .

Ed Stim, another_ junior, has
improved greatly considering his
limited experience on this event.
These men should give the team
two good performers in this ev-
ent, something which was lacking
last year. 1 ‘

/The third apparatus ‘event,

the parallel bars, also has gym-
nasts who have proven them-_
selves in competition. John
Franchuk, a junior, is a solid
P—bar man, who had a first
against Springﬁeld last year,
along with several seconds and
thirds. Stim, who also works the
side horse, placed second and
third in several of the meets
last year.

Electric. But engineering graduates who can
meet them, and who decide to join us, will be-
gin their careers at one of the best times in the
history of the company. For plentiful oppor-
tunities await them in both engineering and
management.

As we enter a new era of communications,

Vvestern Electric engineers are carrying for-

ward assignments that affect the whole art of
telephony from electronic devices to high-speed
sound transmission. And, in the management
category alone, several thousand supervisory
jobs will be available to \V.E. people within
the next 10 years. Many of these new man-
agers will come from the class of ’62.

Now’s the time for you to start thinldng
seriously about the general work area that
interests you at VVestern Electric, the manufac-
turing and supply unit of the Bell Telephone
System. Then when our representative comes
to your campus, you’ll be prepared to discuss
career directions that will help make the inter-
view profitable.

After a man joins VVestern Electric, he will

term for this identification. He
‘stated that a ﬁve dollar fee was
considered for this trimester.

“This would mean $20 for four
years only to
games,” rOlofson declares. “SG
can do it for not more than one
dollarefor all four years.”

Student Beneﬁt

1 “SG pursuing this area is de-
ﬁnitely for student beneﬁt. Not
only will the threat of another
‘area of the University charging
the student for identiﬁcation be
eliminated, but the student will
have a means of ‘positive identi-
ﬁcation. Merchants would be noti-
ﬁed and with this card students
could cash checks anywhere in
the city.”

Olofson understood the ath-
letic department's “recognizable
complaint in this area” for the
athletic events are not covered
ﬁnancially by any part of the
University fee. “Carver was
very happy that we were taking
a positive view in this area.”
Olofson concluded.

In other business, Olofson re-
ported that he announced at the
p_ Chancellor’s luncheon on Tuesday
certain instances of housing dis-
crimination in the Oakland area
toward foreign students.

Culturally Minded?

f‘Many in the Oakland area are
not educationally or "culturally
minded nor are they seriously
concerned with their discrimina-
tion. These foreign students are
getting impressions as well as an
education. They are taking these
back to their countries. And sta-

, tistics show that these people will

probably be the leaders of their
countries some day.

“The administration and the
faculty have become critical that
possibly the University has been
negligent in this area.”

Since a great number of the
foreign students are on the grad-
uate level and choose not to be
restricted by the dormitories or
are married and have no Univer-
sity housing to turn to, they have
been l'orc(~cl to turn to Oakland
for housing. ’

Long-Range View

In a long-range view, Chan-
cellor Litchlleld said that resid-
ences for graduate students and
married students will solve this
problem. “In the interim the ad-

ministration will look into pro-_

viding adequate housing for these
students.”

SG also decided to sponsor an
all-University dance with other
organizations partici-
pating. March 9 is the tentative
date.

announced.

Action: Now under Army test, a Ford-designed glass filament torsion
bar that's lighter, stronger, more flexible than steel

“Looks like you've got something there," the Army Tank
Command said in effect to Ford Motor Company engineers.
"Let's do a feasibility study on tracklaying military vehicles."

The story begins in 1957 when Ford engineers conceived
the idea of a plastic-bonded glass ﬁlament torsion bar for
vehicle suspension systems. It was a revolutionary departure
from the use of solid steel. It promised dramatic weight‘
savings in battle tanks, in personnel carriers and other
military vehicles. For example, as much as 1,000 pounds

in medium tanks.

Compared to steel, the tubular-shaped glass ﬁlament com-
position has greater energy storage potential-—is stronger
and more ﬂexible under heavy load. It may well prove to be
the automobile suspension material of tomorrow . . . cars

suspended on glass! '
