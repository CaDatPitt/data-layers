Tower Roof

Still Leaks,

Residents call KDKA  

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer

Wayne Van Dyne of KDKA-T‘V’s
Action Line, a news segment
designed to help people with
problems when all other efforts
have failed, visited the 16th. ﬂoor of
Tower C Friday to file a reporton
a leaky roof there.

The roof has been leaking water
into students’ rooms for several
months. After complaints were
registered with university housing,
an effort was made to eliminate the
leaking. _ .

However, ‘the roof still» leaks,
dripping water and staining ceil-
ings and rugs, as well as
inconveniencing students. ,

Sophomore Rick Hughes has had
to rearrange the furniture in his
room to prevent it from getting
soaked.

“I had to move my bed and nowl
only have about a six-inch area to
walk around my bed,” he said.
“It’s mainly just the inconvenience

of it. I shouldn’t have to put up
with this.”

‘ ‘The only response we’ve gotten
from the university “is to use more
buckets,” said junior
Fendler. “Every time we
complain, all they do is give us
more buckets.”

Most of the 16th floor residents
agree, and would like some
compensation for living with the
leaking roof.

“For the price that we pay for
these rooms, it is ridiculous to have
to live with buckets all over our
rooms and in the halls, ” said senior
Lou DiToppa. ‘

Students also are concerned that ’

the problem will get worse in the
next few weeks.

“Bubbles filled with water have

formed between the layers of

ceiling paint,” said Fendler.
“And when those bubbles break

we'll have a bigger mess than what 6

is here now.’ ’

status of the radio station’s
open air proposal and its efforts
to eventually have the proposal
approved by the administration
at Friday’s Student Govern-
ment Board meeting.

Couch said that he worked in
conjunction with SGB president

proposal, which was eventually
submitted to Terry Milani,
associate director of the Office
of Student Activities.

"Couch ,briefly explained the -

Josh Baylson in drafting the ‘

Couch said that currently he
is working on the ﬁnal draft of
the proposal that will be
submitted to the -board next-
Friday for approval.

If the proposal is approved
by the board, it will go back to
Milani and Acting Vice
chancellor of Student Affairs
Bill Markus for approval.
It must then be reviewed by the
Board of Trustees for final
approval.

“The importance of the
Board of Trustees. is that the
licensee must be a corporate
entitiy,” Couch said. “The

students cannot own the radio
station. It must be the
University of Pittsburgh.”

Couch saidthatihe hopes the -

board will approve the- open air

proposal. at its May meeting.

If this approval is given in May,
the next step in the establish-
ment of an open air station
would be the filing of an
application for a construction
permit. a

If all goes as planned,WPGH
could conceivably become an
open air radio station by next
winter. -

Construction of an FM open

air station would cost approxi-
mately $24,000 to $30,000,
which would hopefully be paid
by the University- Total

operating costs of such a radio

station would be $15,000 to
$20,000.

In other business, SGB

president Josh Baylson con- ,
' gratulated the president-elect

Stan Galanski and the newly
elected boardmembers.
Galanski said that he would
like to meet with the new board
to discuss remunerations, as
well as the responsibilities of
the board members and those

. of the standing student gov-

ernment committees.

Galanski is the only newly
elected member of the board
with any prior experience after
serving for one year as a
member.

The president-elect and
board member-elect Kim
Watterson will be participating

- actively in restructuring the

Pitt Union Program Council.
both he and Watterson will be
conducting interviews in the
near future for ‘the program
council appointments for next
year. .

Face ‘Room Assignment Lottery Today

   Resident Students

Many resident students will have the question of whether they
will live on campus next year answered today as the room
assignment lottery gets underway. There are approximately
1 936 spaces for returning undergraduates available.

  

Resident students participate in Pitt’s first room
assignment ., lottery beginning today in the Tower A
conference room.

The lottery system came into existence last term when
administrators decided that the “first come, first serve
method” used in past years was not effective in light of the
massive housing shortage so apparent this year. ‘

1 Last year, on Feb.‘ 15, housing applications were mailed I

to every resident. These students were instructed to take
these completed forms to the Office of Student Accounts in
the basement of the Cathedral. On Feb. 16, by 3 p.m., the
quota of 2300 available housing spaces was filled and a
waiting list of 660 students was established. A

Of the students placed on the waiting list, many
complained that they did not receive their applications until
Feb. 17, one full day after the housing quota had been
reached. Other complained that they were unable to stand
in line because of academic or work committments.

After months of debate between the administration and

- students who were opposed to the lottery system, an

agreement was ﬁnally reached. This agreement included
the institution of room lottery by gender.

According to. Fred Fonseca, director ,.of the Office of
Residence'Life, there are 1936 open bed spaces available
for upperclassmen next year. The bed‘spaces will be
divided proportionately according to the number of males
and females currently living on campus. This male-female

breakdown has been established at 57 percent for females

and 47Kpercent for males. .

Students will have until Feb. 7 to select aenumber and .
. determine whether the number that they have drawnis 0 6

within the 1936 limit.

Housing applications will be distributed immediately to

students who are eligible for university housing. These
students will then have until Feb. 16 to complete the

housing application and return it to the Office of Student 0 0

Accounts with a $100 deposit of deferral.

Failure to meet this deadline will cause the student to be . ~

put at the end of the waiting list for housing.

Students not eligible for housing after the lottery will be 1

placed on a waiting list according to their numbers. Before
room bidding takes place in March, a revised list of eligible
students will be drawn up and many students originally on
the waiting list may be eligible for housing.

‘ Burger Outlets lSirnilar in Tour of Franchises

By VINCE ORNATO JR.

Editor’s Note: This is the second
installment of a two-part series on
fast food franchises in Oakland. In
the first article, Vince Omato Jr.
examined Roy Rogers Family
Restaurant and George Aikens.
Evaluation included food quality,
service and cleanliness.

The basics are the same at
Oakland’s major burger franchises,
at McDonald’s, Burger King and
Burger Chef, the raw quality of the
burgers is the same because each
franchise sells 100 percent U.S.
grade A beef shipped in a frozen
patty.

The difference in the restaurants
is found in customer service.

Burger'King has a slight edge

has customer service points in its
favor. “
Burger King has special items
like hot dogs, ham and cheese
sandwiches and onion rings, plus
their burgers are made to order the
way the customer wants them.
MacDonald’s burgers are about
15 cents cheaper throughout the
menu even though the meat weighs
the same.
sandwiches have the same condi-
ments on them: mustard, ketchu
picle and onions. . \
MacDonald’s also sells sundaes
for 50 cents in a variety of ﬂavors.
Both stores‘ have equal food
quality in their products. Each
place is kept clean and the service
is fast. \
Arby’s roast beef sandwiches are
more expensive but bigger than
Roy Rodgers. They are made from

But MacDonald’s -

 

fabricated roast, according to
manager Dahtes Yespigani.
“Fabricated roast is made of 70
percent lean beef from the round
and 30 percent what we call

binding material. That’s beef
trimmings and phosphates for
ﬂavor,”Vespigani said. ‘
Arby’s deals with frozen beef,
not fresh and uses -the latest and
most expensive ovens, according to
Vespigani.
«' “The ovens have force-air
circulation,” he said. “A fan in the
back of each one forces the air to
circle inside the oven.This way the
beef is evenly cooked throughout.”
Arby’s is always kept impress-
ively clean. The. chain stresses

/ customer service and this philoso-

phy is carried out.

Burger Chef sells the frozen
burger patty. The menu includes
special items like soup, Chile,
grilled cheese, fresh bagels and
doughnuts.

Manager Vic Foster said his
store, privately owned, often

receives complaints from Burger
Chef systems because of “too
many extras on the menu.”

“I don’t worry about it,” Foster
said. ‘‘I try to give the students
what they want.” ,

Foster said he strives to always

get warm food to the customers but

human error cannot always be
eliminated.

“We’re geared for a large
amount of business,” he said.

Foster said his kitchen is
inadequate compared to Burger
Chef company kitchens, which
were built to fit a preconceived
design, because his kitchen was
converted from the restaurant that
used to occupy the space. Foster
requests that if your food is
cold,“Return it. A good manager
appreciates’ customers com-
plaints.”

Opinion

Singing In
The Rain

Disgruntled residents on Tower C’s 16th floor have
been forced to turn to Wayne Van Dyne, KDKA’s
citizen advocate—a last resort for people unable to

I . gain help with their problems from other sources.

In this case the students’ problem’ is a leaking roof——a
problem that reportedly has existed for three years.
For these three years,residents_ have attempted to

I i use regular channels to solve their problem. They

filed maintenance reports with the University

— Housing Office and have talked with maintenance

In response, the residents apparently have received
little reaction beyond a supply of buckets.
Fendler, a junior, said: “The only response we've
gotten from the University is to -use more buckets.
Every time we complain, all they do is give us more
buckets.”

Although Fendler’s comments are an oversim-
plification, his point rings true. The University has
made attempts to repair or replace the roof of Tower
C, but it has made little headway withthe project.
Pitt has hired several roofing firms to work” on the
job, but none of them has been able to completethe
task. When students complained to us last term
about the problem, maintenance said it should be
solved by mid-December. «However, the Van Dyne
report shows that students still have raindrops falling
on their heads. —

There can be no excuse for this problem continuing
as long as it has. We understand that the University
has had trouble finding a contractor to complete the
job but when the leaking continues for three years,
the situation must be tolerated no longer.

Any landlord, including the University, is respon-
sible for keeping the property they rent in habitable
condition. Students pay $1,300 a. year to live in a
dorm room and that amount (if money should
guarantee them a dry room without buckets for extra
roommates. Any other condition cannot be justified.

If the University has any concern for the students
whoattend Pitt (a questionable assumption at best),
it must move immediately to solve this problem.
No expense or measure should be ignored if it can
help provide the sodden residents of Tower C with
dry rooms." We have enough faith in Pitt to believe
that they can solve this problem if it brings all its
resources to bear. ' 

Steve 

Page 4—Monday, January 29, 1979

We suggest that the residents of the 16th floor give
the University one last chance to show good faith and
repair the leaking roof. Several weeks should be
enough time to test whether officials intend to fulfill
their legal and moral duties as a landlord and repair
the damaged roof.

We would also remind the residents of the 16th

. floor—and the University—-that there is one last

recourse the residents may take to solve the problem
if there is no solution forthcoming soon. That
recourse lies within the county health department and
the courts.

The residents should investigate and see if the
courts or the health department could help grant
satisfaction of their complaint—-in case the ad-
ministration does not show any firm commitment
toward soluation of the leakage.

However, if that step becomes necessary, it would
be a sad developement indeed.

A “Letters

On Wednesday, Jan. 17, two Pnt
students were arrested for posting
leaﬂets about a forum on Palestine
and. Camp David. In December,
Iranian students were arrested for
posting leaﬂets announcing a

I demonstration against the ‘Shah.

Each time the people were
handcuffed, frisked, and‘ taken to

. the police station. Last Wednes-
day, the students were thrown in .
, jail. — --

What’s going on? Don’t people,

‘have the basic ‘democratic right of

freedom to express political
beliefs?

V The police who stopped
the students on Wednesday
thought they were Iranians. After

1 ﬁnding out they were not, and

annoyed that they didn’t have
identification, the students were
jailed. It cost $102 to get them out.

These students received a

. general warningthat next time it

would be $200, and if Iranians were
found posting’ there would be no
fine, but a jail sentence. it

By stepping up political repres-
sion of Iranians, the police. are

trying to prevent Pitt students from"

hearing about events in Iran. But

Iraniansbelieve it their duty and '

right to educate the American
people about events in Iran; the
relationship between the United
States, the CIA, and the Shah and
the strong interests in Iran.

The Shah’s so called “vacation,”
or perhaps more accurately.
permanent exile, is a. great victory
for the Iranian people. ,But the
struggle is not over. This country is
very concerned about future
developments in Iran, making the
danger of United States troop
involvement a very real threat. It
was for the reason of education that
the Iranian Student ‘Association

carried out the successful demon-
stration in downtown Pittsburgh,
drawing some 150 people.

In December, around the time

that the Iranians were arrested,

members of the Anti-Imperialist
Student Union were posting leaf-
lets for an event of Southern Africa.
They were also stopped by _the
cops, but no arrests were made. All
over campus there are leaﬂets
announcing poetry readings,
speedreading courses, fraternity
parties, political events, etc. As we
all know, the list goes on and on. To
our ‘knowledge, none of. these
people have ever been arrested. It
is not coincidental that the ‘cops
arrested the Iranians. Nor is it just
a few racist cops.»It is a police
action, most likely directed by
University officials. The. aim is to

Jesus——.The. Only Way?  

/ _ .
‘There is a contradiction, in the
thinking of many Pitt students that

I am "hard pressed to explain. _.
It deals with their view of Jesus’ ‘

Christ. I can understand “a person
who does not believe in God or one
who does not believe that Jesus is
God.

But _there are many who say that
Jesus is one of many paths to God,
and yet Christ himself says that he
is the only way to God. The only
reason that Jesus has the right to
say this is that he is God in the
ﬂesh. Jesus said many times that
he and God are the same.

Is it not true that the main source
of information concerning the
historical Christ is the New

Testament? And certainly, from a
religious point of view, do not the
teachings of Christ, even in
non-Christiam circles, derive
primarily from the Bible?

\/

Then how can one talk of Jesus
as being only one of many ways to
God and neglect such statements
as, “And there is salvation in no
one else, for there is no other name
under heaven given among men by
which we . must be saved?”
If any one can help me understand
this, I would appreciate hearing
from you. Thank you.

Confusing Robin and Alt

I would like to clarify an article
written in a recent edition of the
Pitt News. The article was a review
of the Bob Seger concert that was
at the Civic Arena the last Friday in
December.

Keith Brian, the author of the
article ' stated: “Robbins stood
amongst ..the crowd—.—-”. Robin
Robbins was NOT in the crowd, it

was Alto Reed, the saxophonist
for the group. .

This mistake is highly uncalled
for, since Alto and Robin look
nothing alike. Next time, I hope
that your reporters check their facts
before printing an article.‘

‘Moot Trial’ for Grade School

A moot civil trial will orient grade school students from J
Squirrel Hill with the issues of negligence and liability
early next month in the moot courtroom of Pitt’s School of
Law. ~

The “Law and Justice Project for Elementary School
Students” will be conducted Saturday, Feb. 10 for ﬁfth
grade students from Linden Elementary School in Squirrel
Hill and Shadyside’s Liberty Elementary School.

“The program's objective is to give the children a
fundamental appreciation for the way a trial is handled by
the various parties and why certain actions must be
taken,” said James Hunter, assistant University Counsel.

The trial will be divided into two segments with a brief
intermission. Students will be shown a composition of a
courtroom and the roles played by the participants of a trial
followed by a question and answer session.

A group of 12 students will be randomly selected to be
jurors. Two teachers will perform a part in the skit,
witnessed by everyone, excluding the 12 jurors.

The attorneys will present their cases by calling
witnesses, cross-examining the other side’s witnesses and
presenting closing arguments to the jury.

The remaining students who observe . but do not
participate actively in the trial will be asked to vote on their
opinion as to which side, should be awarded the verdict.

Pitt Professor Wins Award

Paul Grieco, professor of chemistry at Pitt, has been
awarded a Research Fellowship Award by the Japan
Society for the Promotion of Science.

Grieco will begin a lecture tour in Japan this October on
new approaches to the development of synthetic drugs and
the development of compounds to suppress tumor cells.

Dr. Takeski Matsumoto of Hakkaido University, who
nominated Grieco for the award, will act as host scientist

during his month-long tour at several universities and

industrial research facilities in Japan.
He will leave for Japan following brief lecture tours in
Berlin and Poland in September.

Kane Painting Donated

Pitt has received the John Kane painting “Garfield and
Herron Hill” as a gift from alumnus Joseph Riggio.

The oil painting, completed in 1931, depicts a Pittsburgh
landscape, including the Cathedral of Learning and the Pitt
campus.

‘The painting will be on display in the University Art
Gallery and will be exhibited during the National Mayor’s
Conference this June.

Kane, a self-taught painter, emigrated from Scotland to
America and spent most of his adult life in Pittsburgh.
He is best know for his primitive stylistic techniques.

Pitt ‘Dickson Prize‘ Winner

Bert W. O’Malley, M.D., of Baylor College, has been
named the 1978-79 recipient of Pitt’s Dickson Prize in
Medicine for outsanding contributions to the progress of
medicine.

O’Malley, chairman of the Department of Cell Biology
for Population Research and Reproduction Biology at
Baylor’s College of»Medicine, is the first alumnus to
receive the prize. . He graduated summa cum laude from
Pitt’s school of medicine.

O’Malley’s research work on gene regulation by
hormones has led to discoveries that are seen as potential
weapons against single cell hereditary diseases such as
sickle cell anemia, hemophilia and certain forms of mental
retardation. -

The —Dickson Prize, one of the most distinguished
academic honors bestowed by Pitt, carries a $10,000
honorarium. Those honored in the past include John H.
Gibbin J r., developer of the heart/ lung machine and Earl

‘Last of the Red Hot Lovers ’Smqsh atPlayhouse

By PHIL CONTES

Pitt News Staff Writer

. Last of the Red Hot Lovers

Neil Simon
Pgh. Playhouse

Barney Cashman gets three
chances at an affair with three
different women and like the
mighty Casey, he strikes out.
That's the basic premise of Neil
Simon's comedy, “Last of the Red
Hot, Lovers” at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse Theatre, running nightly
through Feb. 4.

Richard Rauh creates Cashman’s
character on stage. Cashman is the
41-year-old owner of a seafood
restaurant who has been happily

married for 20 years. But for the

last two years he’s been entertain-
ing thoughts of having an affair.

He's not quite sure why he wants
an affair. He loves his wife. But
just once he wants to break the
pattern of his “nice but boring
life.”

Cashman wants nothing sordid.
He wants the memory to be
beautiful, to sustain him. for the
rest of his life. So he brings girls
up to his working mother’s
apartment. Each time he is
hilariously thwarted.

He wants emotional involvement
with Elaine Navazio (Katie Karlo-
vitz), but she is so cold that
Cashman wonders if she needs
gloves to take off her underwear.

Karlovitz is excellent as the
incredibly callous Elaine. She's
crude and tough, delivering her
cuts like Don Rickles; but there is
just a hint of underlying tender-
ness, which the klutzy Cashman
almost succeeds in bringing out.
She points out the crucial conﬂict of
Cashman’s situation. Can he really
ﬁnd something beautiful in an
encounter that goes against his
morals?

Seven months later, Cashman
tries again—this time with Bobbi
Michelle, (Helena Ruoti). a kooky,
pot smoking, out of work actress.
Ruoti is a bundle of energy on
stage; perfect for the role of the
vivacious Bobbi. But even with his

newly acquired expertise. Cash-
man is unable to take advantage of
the innocent yet paradoxically
perverted Bobbi. She tells him of
her offbeat sexual adventures, each
time professing, “I just don’t know
how I got into that motel room,”
then adding, “butl know you don’t
have anything like that on your
mind.” In the end, Cashman’s
decency wins out. Bobbi ends up
getting him high while they sit
singing songs on the sofa.
Cashman’s last chance is with
Jeanette Fisher (Patricia Cena), his
wife’s best friend. Jeanette is

nervous, insecure and depressed.

She comes into the apartment
wearing dark glasses and clutching

_ her purse to her body as protection.

Slowly she is being destroyed by
the knowledge of her l1usband’s
affair. She has lost faith in human
beings and, like Diogenes, asks
Cashman to name her just three
kind, loving, decent bei-ngs on
earth. Cashman begins to falter,
then triumphs with a method that
will have you laughing in the aisles.

Rauh is excellent throughout as
Cashman, taking his character
through a gradual metamorphosis
and a final reformation and
reaffirmation of his essential
morals. All the characters work
well together.

“Last of the Red Hot Lovers” is
a first rate production of an
American masterpiece comedy.

Melodies Flow in Dire Straits’ Debut Album

By SAM ROSS]
Pitt News Staff Writer
Dire Straits
Warner Bros.

There’s a nice melodic ﬂow

throughout the debut album of the ‘

British group, Dire Straits. Fine

I melodies along with methodical

syncopation make for a most
original sound. The group plays
rock, folk, even a bit of country in a
tight, calmly restrained manner
that’s purely original.

The group is led by Mark
Knopﬂer who plays all lead guitars
and handles all vocals. All material
was composed by Knopﬂer as well.
John Illsley on bass, Pick Withers
on‘-‘drums, and rhythm guitarist
David Knopﬂer complete the band.

“Dire Straits” opens with three
multi-rythmical numbers, “Down
to the Waterline,” “Water ‘of
Love” and “Setting Me Up.” All
three are standouts and exemplify
the effective use of syncopation.

“Six Blade Knife” follows. It’s
Knopﬂer’s bittersweet ode to the
traumas of breaking up.

Side one concludes with “South-
bound Again,” a ﬁne easy-listen-
ing composition.

Second Generation
By Howard Fast

“Second Generation” is an
appropriate title for Howard F ast’s
sequel to “The Immigrants.”

-The new work continues with the

story of Dan Lavette, ﬁsherman
turned shipping magnate turned
pauper, but focuses on his
daughter, Barbara.

“Second Generation” takes off
which “Immigrants” ended.
Lavette leaves his wife, Jean, to
marry his Chinese mistress. Jean
marries a wealthy banker and

“Sultans of Swing” opens side
two. Knopﬂer’s neo-Bob Dylan
vocals contrast with intermittent
lead guitars ‘ to make this the
strongest cut on the album.

“In the Gallery” has a quasi-
Latin, reggae-type beat with a
genuine profundity as far as the
lyrics go. ~ _

“Wild iWest End” follows. It
evokes images of a mood, a place,
and a time in the life of the west
side of a town.

The ﬁnal cut, “Lions” is a
smooth ballad about trying too hard
and the utter futility of effort
unacknowledged. \ Y

The precision of execution and
intricate arrangements make this a
ﬁne debut album, with only a few
lapses into mediocrity.

Take It To The Max +
Max Demian
RCA Records

Max Demian is a Florida-based
band that was big around the
Miami club circuit. The group is
comprised of Jim Lefevre on guitar,
Kirt Pennebaker on bass and
vocals, drummer Pete Siegel, lead
guitarist Paul Rose and Dan Howe
on keyboards.

Barbara grows up in the home of a
stepfather she despises.

As soon as she is old enough to
be on her own, Barbara rebels by
working in a Depression-era soup
kitchen. The action ends what is
left of the polite difference that
served as a relationship between
stepdaughter and stepfather.
Finally, in an act of deﬁance,
Barbara bolts for Europe.

From here, the course is
predictable. Barbara falls in love
with a French flyer who gets shot
down in the Spanish Civil War,
she is accosted by Nazis during a
trip through Germany and when
she returns home to San Francisco,

  Live”

Max Demian specializes in
rambunctious, high-energy, rock

’n’ roll. Band leader Rose does all i

the writing on the debut album,
“Take It To The Max.”

The musical content of the album
is, at best, lackluster. Lyrically,
however, Rose delves into the
unexpected and bizarre. Men swim
through hurricanes, travel to a land
populated by giant lizards, get
captured by a UFO and smuggle
cheerleaders into a locker room.

Rose vocals lack range and often
sound dull and distant. Max also
boasts three chord guitar riffs that
sound as interesting. as a chain
saw. The keyboard work comes
through loud and clear though.
Howe must have taken special

» pains to make sure he hammered

out every note.

The album was co—produced by
Frank D’Agusta of “Frampton
fame. Unfortunately his
production of “Take it to the Max”
falls far short of his previous effort.

Generally, the album is about as
exciting as a stale loaf of bread.
Look for this one to end up in the
bargain bin of your local record
store.

she learns that her wastrel of a
brother is trying to swindle her
inheritance. _p

But, there’s an all’s well that
ends well finale to “Second
Generation” and Fast allows
himself enough circulating sub-
plots to continue with another
novel—a' great commercial move
but not an artistic one.

“Second Generation” is an
example of the sloppy sequel.
Fast builds on his characters from
“The lmmigrants” ‘but is remark-
ably inconsistent in details like
description and personality.

“Second Generation” deals with
a period of approximately 20 years,

Max Demian’; release Is entitled, “Take It To The Max”.

‘Next Generation ’-‘The Immigrants ’: Round Two

but the amount of ground Fast tries
to cover is too vast for credibility’s
sake. Barbara seems to have knack
for appearing at every major event
of the 1930s and through various
other characters, Fast tries to give
a vantage point of view of each
aspect of World War II.

The low caliber dialogue that
runs the gamit from banal to
insipid also damages Fast’s
authenticity. This, combined with
a total disregard for social
conventions of the period, creates a
disjointed style.

rThe post-World War II atmos-
phere in the bay region is
presented in such a Utopian light

that bigoted longshoremen become
like residents of Walton’s Mount-
ain.

When B,arbara’s half brother Joe
marries the granddaughter of
Lavette’s business partner, one
wedding guest gushes, “Joe’s half
Chinese, one quarter French and
one Quarter Italian, and Sally's half
Jewish and half Irish. What
wonderful children they’ll have.”

One of Fast’s reasons for writing
both books is to describe the
melting pot of American society.
However, what he has done is turn
the melting pot into a can of
condensed Campbell’s Soup.

Sad Cafe- True to English Rock Tradition

By SAM ROSSI
_ Pitt News Staff Writer
Misplaced Ideals
Sad Cafe
A & M

Manchester, England . has
spawned some of rock ‘ music’s
greatest performers and Sad Cafe
seems to be true to that tradition.

Sad Cafe’s newest released “Mis-
placed Ideals” is loaded with
dynamic, high energy rock that is
sure to please the hard rock
listener.

Sad Cafe consists of vocalist Paul
Young with Ashley Mulford_ and
Ian Wilson on guitars. Tony
Cresswell plays drums, Vic Emer-
son is on keyboards and John

Stimpson is on bass. Young wrote
most of the material on “Misplaced
Ideals” with help from other band
members.

The album opens with two
pulsating rockers, “Restless" and
“Here Come the Clowns.” Young
belts out the vocals, clearly and
distinctly with very capable dynam-
ic range.

“Run Home Girl” follows. This

cut has been getting a lot of air
play, and rightfully so. It’s
arranged extremely well and is the
album's best offering.

Side one comes to a close with
two relentlessly driving numbers,
"Black Rose” and “I Believe.”

A duo of gutsy rockers open side
two, “Babylon” and “Shell-
shocked.” ,

Next, are “Hungry Eyes” and

i“Feel Like Dying.” Both are blues
numbers with appropriately force-
ful vocals by Young.

The vivacious “On With the
Show” concludes the album.

Sad Cafe is a group with energy
to burn and they leave their mark
distinctly with “Misplaced Ideals,”
an album sure to please the hard
rock audience.

Maryland’s swim team talked
before and during, but not after its
72-41 loss to Pitt (6-0) Saturday at
College Park.

“We shut them up,” said Trew,
responsible for two of Pitt’s 10 ﬁrst
place ﬁnishes. “They were talking
about how good they were and how
they were going to beat us.

“We didn’t let it bother us.

We just went about our business

without saying a word.” j

Besides Trew’s pair of wins in
the 500 and 1,000-yard freestyles,
the Panthers picked up victories in
the 200-yard freestyle (Mickey
Termin); 200-yard individual med-

ley (Mark Schuman); three-meter
diving (Scott Winkler); and 100-
yard freetsyle (Termin).

Pitt also won the 200-yard
backstroke (Stu Swanson); 100-
yard breastroke (Mike Connor);
400-yard medley relay (Swanson,
Connor, Schuman, and Bob Green-
wald); and 400-yard freestyle relay
(Rick Carter," Greenwald, Tom
McGinley, and Schuman).

Trew and Swanson set pool
records in the 500-yard freestyle
and 200-yard backstroke, respect-
ively.

It was an important win for Pitt,

4 which had not won at College Park

since 1959. Maryland was
considered one of the few teams

that could defeat Pitt, unbeaten in
its last 16 dual meets.

“It was fun beating them in their
pool,” Trew said. “They reallly
talked about how bad it was and
how no one could beat them there.
Heck, we can swim anywhere and
still win. We have that kind of
team.”.

The win, according to Trew, gave
the Panthers “a big shot of
confidence. ”

“It felt good getting back on the
road,” the sophomore said. “Our
attitude was good. We were ready
for them."

“Things are going well,” Trew
continued. “I have a feeling we’re
going to have a really awesome
team at the end ‘bf the year.”

By JEFF DUROSKO

Pitt News Staff Writer

Michigan State’s women’s gym-
nastics team left Pittsburgh yester-

.day with just a little bit more

respect for the Pantherettes than
they had upon arrival. While Pitt
lost yesterday’s dual meet to the
12th-ranked Spartanettes, they
went down fighting, losing only
131.70 to 130.30.

ln the first event, the vault, Holly
Martino scored 8.7, tying for first
place with State’s Colleen Smith.
Spartanette Kit Bunker placed
third, scoring 8.2 and Pitt’s Bonnie
Tressler was fourth with a score of
8.15.

Following the vault, Pitt was
behind in the team scoring race by

four-tenths of a point, -32-95 to
32.55.

The next event was the uneven
parallel bars and Martino won it
with a score of 8.65. Tressler was
second with an 8.5 and Bunker tied
with teammate Diane Lovato for
third with a score of 8.35.

This strong showing in the
unevens enabled Pitt to catch up in
the team scoring, tying State at
66.10.

“I was shocked that we were
even after two events,” Sanft said.

Tressler now showed her
strength in the ﬁnal two events,
winning both. She took the balance
beam with a score of 8.7 and won
the floor exercise with the highest
score of the day in any event, an
8.75. .Martino placed right behind

Tressler in the floor exercise,
scoring an 8.55.

Winning these ﬁnal two events
also enabled Tressler to take top
honors in the all-around competi-
tion with a total score of 34.10.
Martino was less than two-tenths of
a point behind with a 33.95 and
State’s Lori Boes was third at
33.10.

The team score of 130.30 was the
highest this year. but Sanft said
that the Pantherettes can and will
do better when they are at full
strength. -

“When we're at full strength, we
should be a 135 point team, which
should rank us between 10th and
13th in the nation,’ she said.

Pitt’s next meet will be Friday
night at third-ranked Clarion.

Penn State Almost
Lllllswin From Pitt “

By MARIASCIULLO
Pitt News Asst. Sports Editor

“Talk about having to ‘earn
one,” said Pitt basketball coach
Tim Grgurich following his team’s
50-44 win over a maddeningly
patient Penn State lineup.

The Nittany Lions, a 7-14 team
coached by Dick Hatter, a man
accustomed. to winning, calmly
passed the ball around and took the
good shots most of the game.

Using this game plan, Penn State
hoped to repeat its upset ’ of
Duquesne last week, when the
Dukes left State College with an
embarrassing 54-49 loss.

It almost worked.

No team likes to be forced into -

playing its opponent’s game, but
Pitt soon found that, like it or not, it
must be patient. -The Panthers
waited for good shots, while
uninterrupted minutes passed each
time Penn State controlled the ball.
Thus, Pitt employed its own
“standstill pitch’ ’ offense.
Because of the slow pace, the
game was not decided from

anywhere on the floor but from the
free throw line.
scored almosthalf their points on
foul shots (22 for 34) and were

fortunate that Penn State did not .
-get the same opportunity.

The
Nittany Lions took only 12 free
throws, and made eight.

On the floor, however, Sammie
Ellis was the dominant figure. Ellis
often drove into the lane, was
fouled and in this manner scored 10
of his 18 points. He also led the
Panthers with six rebounds.

Six rebounds by Ellis indicates
the kind of night Pitt had on the
boards. For only the second time
this season, the Panthers were
outrebounded, 21 to 18. It was a
strange low-scoring game, where
there just weren’t many rebounds
to be had.

And how often. will guard Pete
(Strickland match center Sam
Clancy in rebounds (two apiece),
while Clancy turns‘ in more assists
than his pointguard teammate?

Track Invite Marks Fall;
Pitt’s Siriano Wins Mile

Bv MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Asst. Sports Editor

Three meet records were broken
and one tied at the 10th annual Pitt
Invitational run last weekend on
the Fitzgerald Fieldhouse track.
The host Panthers were led by
triple jumper Larry Kinney and
miler Gary Siriano.

Kinney, who placed second in his
event, broke former Pitt athlete
Brian Salter’s eight-year-old school
record of 50-2 in the triple jump by
leaping 50-4‘/4 on his last attempt.
Both he and invitational winner
Eugene Scott of the Virginia
Military Institute bettered the old
meet record of 50-3‘/2, set in 1975.
Scott, who was awarded the title of
Most Valuable Field Performer,
turned in a jump of S0-8‘/4, also on
his last attempt.

Siriano dueled East Tennessee's
Noel Shannon for six and one-half
laps before kicking the ﬁnal 330
yards to bring home Pitt’s only
track victory of the meet, winning
the mile in 4:11.5. Shannon, one of
Ireland’s best milers, set a fairly
slow pace for the ﬁrst half mile and

noting this, a spectator yelled,

bad idea. Although the visitors ran
their offense efficiently, they

then the runners passed the
three-quarter mile mark in 3:13.

“Because of the pace, I knew I
could win it in the last quarter-
mile,” said Siriano. “Shannon’s a
great runner. Just last week he ran
a 4:06, but it’s early in the indoor
season yet and I hope to get around
that time soon.”

“Gary kept even pace with
Shannon, Terpin (also from East
Tennessee) and VMI’s Jody
Weatherwax,” said coach Mike
Agostinella, “but then he threw in
a couple of fast 220’s and it broke
them.”

The race was a repeat of sorts
from last year, when Pitt’s Tom
Herrmann outkicked a heralded
ﬁeld to win the Chancellor's One
Mile Run, as it is ofﬁcially called.

The Panthers had top-six ﬁnish-
ers in every event, including Gene
Roach, second in the pole vault
(14); Tim Blackshear, fourth in
both the triple (45-2‘/4) and long
(23-5‘/2) jumps; Mike Wallace, ﬁfth
in the shot put with a throw of 50-3;
and Dale Baker, ﬁfth in the high
jump (6-5).

weren’t the entertaining showmen
of their school’s football team.

Grgurich said that he felt his
team needed this kind of slow-
paced game. “This was a good
game for us to play,” the coach
said. “For once, we couldn’t rely
on just taking the ball down the
court and shooting on .the run
because it wouldn’t have worked.

“Instead we had to_ use our
heads and really think about what

Top-six ﬁnishers in track events
for Pitt were: Darren Geary,
fourth, 1000 meters; Greg Conover,
fourth, 880-yard run; and Jack
Cade, sixth in the 1000 meters.
The Panther mile-relay of Bud
Cooper (49.5), Larry Shippen
(49.2), Dwayne DeFore (49.0) and

Keith Leckenby (50.5). were third,

with a time of 3218.7. Placing sixth
was the distance medley relay of
Bill McShea (880 yards), Mike
Giovanetti (440), Randy Bailey
(three-quarter ‘mile) and Keith
Sample (mile).

The meet record of 6.1 for the
high hurdles was tied in trials by
West Virginia University's Garnett
Edwards and VMI’s Tim Bridges.
Edwards won the hurdles ﬁnal and‘
the long jump, for which he was
selected Most Valuable Track
Performer.

Richmond’s Julian Spooner sur-
passed the meet record of 1:55.] by
winning the half-mile in 1:53.5.
Kent State shot putter Gene Divrey
far exceeded the seven-year-old
meet record of 56- ‘/2 with a throw
of 57-10.

Wait for Penn State

we were going to have to do to
score.”

The win ‘evened the Panthers’
Eastern Eight record at 2-2, while
Penn State’s dropped to 1-4.
Although nobody in the western
division of the conference seems to
have a home court advantage in the
playoffs guaranteed by this time
next week, Pitt probably will know
whether it can plan on playing any
