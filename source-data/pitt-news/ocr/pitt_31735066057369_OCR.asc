Staff Writer

‘Jeff Porter, the Pitt soccer
team’s second-leading scorer
last year, will likely start the
season on the sidelines as a
spectator.

Porter, a junior midfielder,
watched Tuesday’s practice
supported by crutches and is
expected to miss the opener
against Bucknell.

“We are 90 percent sure
[Porter] will be out for

Sunday,” head coach Joe
Luxbacher said. “He’s very
doubtful.”

Porter severely sprained his
right ankle Aug. 25, the day
before Pitt’s first preseason
scrimmage.

What’s more, he is not alone
on the injury shelf as another
starting midfielder, J.L.
Gorsin, is suspect with an
injured foot.

Watching a top scorer go
down in the preseason is not a
first for the soccer team.
Entering the season last year,
Eric Prex —— the 1992 leading
scorer — broke his left arm
and played through most of
1993 in a soft cast.

Pitt is struggling in the mid-
field right now because neither
Porter nor Gorsin have played
in either of Pitt’s two scrim-
mages. ’

Both are players that the
Panthers can ill-afford to lose.
Porter was second only to Erik
Duffy last year with eight
goals and two assists for a total

ed for soccer opener

of 18 points. Gorsin, a junior,
scored one goal and had three
assists for five points. Gorsin
started every game last year,
while Porter started all but
one.

. “The thinnest part of our
team in terms of depth — the
inside midfielders —— both are
out,” Luxbacher said.

' Porter doesn’t have much of

a chance to see action against /

Bucknell.

“We’re definitely not plan-
ning on him playing on
Sunday,” Luxbacher said. “If
he happens to be ready, that’s a
b o n u s .
He’s get-
ting bet-
ter, but he
turned it

 

R i g h t
now we’re planning on some-
one else being in that posi-
tion.”

Gorsin, who has a pulled
quadricep muscle, could possi-
bly be available. a

“He can run now but he
can’t strike a ball. Then he gets
really bad pains,” Luxbacher
said.

“We’re hoping, with treat-
ment this week, he’ll be ready
to play. But if not, we’ve
learned of some other guys
that have stepped up and done
a pretty good job at midfield.”

Senior John Lopus, who
started 14 games for Pitt- a year

ago, is one of them. Lopus has

been impressive playing as the
attacking midfielder in the two

scrimmages, according to

Luxbacher.

Another scenario has second
team All-Big East selection
Charlie Wasson moving into
the midfield and junior Adam
Goldberg taking Wasson’s
usual spot in the backfield.

An additional player that
could be sitting out the first
game of the year is forward
Keith Hoetzlein, who was a
situational player last year and
figures to have a larger role
this year. Hoetzlein also has
missed the Scrimmages with
injuries.

Senior captain Eric Prex
says some of the injuries could
be due to a very physical pre-
season.

“People are fighting for

spots. It’s only natural. 1 mean
freshmen are coming in, and
they are trying to prove them-
selves, so of course they’re
going to try to throw their bod-
ies in,” Prex said.

The injury situation has
some of the players worried
about Pitt's chances in the
coming game. 9

“Personally, I am,” Pfgx

said. “Everybody’s got pulls _

and strains and ankle and knee
problems, but hopefully it’ll
work out.”

“We have a week off after
Bucknell so we’ll have some
time to rest up after that, but
we need to get off to a good
start.” Lopus said.

Color man Johnny Sauer retires
year early, /eaves Panther booth

By David Saliba
Staff Writer

The beginning of the Pitt
football season marks the end
of a great career for one per-
son. Johnny Sauer, the color
analyst for WTAE—AM radio
broadcasts of Pitt football, put
down his microphone for
good.

Sauer, who held this position
for 18 years, had announced
previously
that the
1994 season
would _be
his last, but
decided in
agreement
with his doctors to retire
immediately.

“He called it a great ride; I’d
agree,” play-by-play man Bill
Hillgrove said.

“We are extremely sorry
Johnny won’t be able to com-
plete his ﬁnal season as part of
the Pitt football broadcast
team,” Jim Carter, WTAE
General Manager, said.

“Johnny and Bill Hillgrove
had become an institution,
and I’m sure the Pitt foot-
ball listening audience
will miss his football exper-
tise and his candid commen-
tary.”

According to Hillgrove, the
health status of Sauer con-
tributed to his early retirement.

“John had planned on com-
ing back for his final year and
was very much looking for-
ward to it,” Hillgrove said.
“He found out that his health
problems were too much for
the doctors to allow him to
continue.”

Before his broadcasting

 

years with Hillgrove began in

1974, Sauer coached at the
Citadel and led the College
All-Stars against the Green
Bay Packers in 1966 and 1967.
In his college days he was a
member of the famous 1945
Army squad which featured
Glenn Davis and Doc
Blanchard.

“Johnny Sauer has been an
integral part of the Pitt football
family for the past two
decades,” Pitt Athletic
Director Oval Jaynes said.
“He has been a loyal and
honest friend of Pitt foot-
ball since he began serving
as color analyst for our games
20 years ago, and we will
greatly miss his presence. John
will be missed; he certainly
made his mark on Pitt foot-
ball.”

The retirement of Sauer
puts an end to an acclaimed
tandem which was synony-
mous with Pitt football.
Hillgrove and Sauer became
quite popular as a team, and as
this duo ends, emotions run
high.

“[Sauer] was really down,”
Hillgrove said. “I talked to him

_ twice on the phone last week,

and he became emotional. It is
like something was taken from
him.”

For Hillgrove, it not only
affects him emotionally but
affects him in the booth as
well.

“With Johnny you never had
to lead him into anything, John
would initiate the direction of
the conversation,” Hillgrove
said.

“I don’t see anybody coming
into a situation, new,
being able to do that right
now.”

The only concerns for
Hillgrove while working with
Sauer were the score, the posi-
tion of the ball and who has
the lead. Sauer took care of
everything else, Hillgrove
said.

“Nobody probably knew
more about football than
Johnny Sauer. Talk to me
about NFL coaches, college

coaches, I don’t care,”
Hillgrove said. “He’s as good a
student of the game [as] there
is.”

As for the microphone next
to Hillgrove, it has been hand-
ed to former Pitt offensive
lineman Mark May.

May, who graduated from
Pitt in 1981, spent 12 years in
the NFL, 10 of which were
with the Washington Redskins.

“I’m ecstatic,” Hillgrove
said of the hiring of May as
the color analyst.

“He’s bright and he’s articu-
late. I’m looking forward to
working with him.”

“We are extremely pleased
that Mark will be returning to
join the Pitt football broadcast
team,” Jaynes said. 9

“His experience both as a
college and professional player
should enable him to provide
entertaining and insightful
commentary.”

Fitzgerald brothers

square off Saturday ‘

By Brady Slater
Staff Writer

Sean Fitzgerald starts the
first game of his Division 1
career Saturday against Texas.

Fitzgerald’s brother, sopho-
more Pat Fitzgerald, is the
third-string tight end on the
Longhorns’ depth chart.

Any rivalry there?

“We’re not going to be on
the field at the same time,” he
said. “So we’re not really com-
peting against each other. It’s
just like having a friend out
there.”

Sean insists that the compe-
tition between the brothers.
begins at home and ends on
the field. He’ says that describ-
ing the two as competitive
when they’re at home is an
“understatement.”

“We’re fighting at the dinner
table all the time and stuff like
that,” Sean said.

But when the two brothers
meet on Saturday, there’s no
chance Sean or Pat will come
in game contact with each
other.

“He’s just another offensive
guy out there,” Sean said.
“I’ve never really played
against him in a game.”

Pat, who is a year younger
than Sean, redshirted last year.
In 1992 he was an All-
Conference tight end at Los
Angeles Valley College, where
Sean attended last year.

The brothers’ parents, Stan
and Pierrette, are going to be
at the game along with some
other relatives.

And seeing ‘as how Sean is
on the verge of the most
important start of his career,
it’s easy to figure where the
Fitzgeralds’ loyalties will lie.

“They’ll be on the Pitt
side for this game,” Sean
insists. S

But when Fitzgerald steps
onto the field on Saturday
against the 18th-ranked Texas
Longhorns, his baptism into
Division 1 football will be a far
cry from any in-house scrim-
mage.

That’s why he’s happy he’ll
be able to look across the hud-
dle and see number 29.

“Curtis Martin is the best
back I’ve ever been around,”
he said. “He’s going to help
me tremendously. He’ll take a
lot of heat off me.”

And what about getting that
first pass out of the way?

“As long as I complete it, it
doesn’t matter to me,”
Fitzgerald said.

To Fitzgerald, stepping in as
starting quarterback does not
necessarily carry with it the
dual tag‘ of being a team leader.

“Reuben Brown and Curtis
Martin are leaders in their own
right,” Fitzgerald said. “I’m

just going to try and get us in a
winning position, to do what I
can to help this team.”
Fitzgerald said that like
everyone else he’ll have but-

terﬂies before the game.
“But I just have to relax and

back is ready.

“John Ryan has made excel-

lent progress/I’ Majors said.
“His knowledge of the offense
is much improved.”

Neither Majors nor Ryan
believes that Ryan did some-
thing that lost him the job.

“It’s the coaches’ choice. I
went out during the spring and
at camp and did everything
that was asked of me and even
a little more,” Ryan said. “I
thought I did what I came out
to do. I’m happy.”

Majors says that both he and
the other players have confi-
dence in both of the guys. And
he is impressed with the way
Ryan has handled his backup
role.

“He’s such a wonderful
young man,” Majors said. “He
is certainly a team man from
the word ‘go.’ He has much
pride in himself and in being a
part of this team.”

While he might not be
content in his role, Ryan is
ready.

kAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

“I feel real confident that if
Sean would get hurt or go
down somehow, I could go in
there and do just as good or
even better job,” he said.

Throughout their fight to be
number one, Fitzgerald and
Ryan have expressed nothing
but respect for each other.

“He’s a good competitor,
and we’re both capable
of doing the job,” Fitzgerald
said.

“I think he’ll be real good
this year,” Ryan said, echoing
the hopes of all Pitt fans.

And on Saturday, Pitt fans
will get an idea of how good
he can be. ‘

Is Fitzgerald nervous that his
first start is against football
powerhouse Texas?

“I don’t think it matters,” he
said.

“There’s always going to be
pressure and high expecta-
tions. I like jumping into
Texas!”

“Tom is a very tough guy,”
Brown said. “What makes
him good is that he keeps
working hard, no matter what.
He never slacks a bit. If he
messes up, which doesn’t
happen often, he comes right
back harder the next down.”

Brown said he’s been
impressed with Bamdt’s atti-
tude and adaptation to defense
after switching from offensive
guard in 1991.

“He sticks to playing foot-
ball and doesn’t seem to let
things get to him,” Brown
said. “He’s always been
aggressive, but when he
switched to defense, he had to
learn a new position and get
comfortable.

“Now he knows the tech-
niques and brings his aggres-
siveness to them.”

As far as overall improve-
ments to a Panther defense
which has not been given
much credit nation-wide,
Barndt said the players are
faster and in better shape than
last year.

“This year we need to be
more consistent and work
hard to keep depth at defen-
sive line,” Barndt said. “That
will help with our toug
schedule.” -

Barndt, whose goal since
coming to Pitt has been to
play in a bowl game, said the
athletic department brought
the right coach here last year
to set the team back on

0 course.

“I like that [head coach
John Majors] is always on the
move and getting things done,
like recruiting and pushing
for stadium renovations,”
Barndt said.

He said Majors, as a “basic
disciplinarian” and proven
winner, has the respect of the
entire team.

“He’s a good coach because
he doesn’t miss a thing,”
Barndt said. “I never heard a
player second—guess one of
his decisions.”

Despite his uncertainty
about the defense and experi-
encing several seasons in
which the team put up dismal
numbers, Barndt does not
express any hesitation about a
schedule including such for-
midable powers as Miami,
Ohio State and Virginia Tech
along with an opening day
battle with the Texas
Longhorns.

He said he is glad the
Panthers play a schedule
“where if you can win seven
games, you’d definitely go to
a bowl.”

I’d rather play quality teams

the entire season so we know.

where we stand,” he said,

Receivers  

0From page 14
Pinkney, who are considered
college football’s best receiv-
ing tandem, can not participate
in the first game against Pitt.

“We will be without Mike
Adams and Lovell Pinkney,”
Texas head coach John
Mackovic announced at
Tuesday morning’s press con-
ference. “So at that part of the
team, we have been working
hard to patch up.”

Adams and Pinkney were
suspended from the team and
fined $500 each after they
were provided, by an individ-
ual not associated with the
university, with the use of a
rental car for more than five

‘weeks at a value of $1,000.

While the individual was not
a representative of Texas’
interests, NCAA amateur‘ sta-
tus rule l2.l2(m) declares loss
of amateur status if an athlete
receives “preferential treat-
ment, benefits or services

because of the individual’s

athletics reputationor skill or
pay—back potential as a profes-
sional athlete.”

The blue ribbon committee,
which was appointed to look
into the matter, recommended
that both players miss the first
game. The university will then
ask the NCAA to immediately
restore the athletes.’ eligibility.

Adams, who has been serv-
ing a leave of absence follow-
ing an off—the-field incident in
Austin, Texas, earlier this
summer, was cleared to return
to the team a day before he
was suspended, again.

Pinkney, too, thickened the
plot on Monday.

Attorneys hired by Texas are
investigating whether Pinkney
took a trip to Los Angeles to
meet with a sports agent in
May. If Pinkney did meet with
a sports agent, then his ama-
teur status would be terminat-
ed.-

Pinkney denied the allega-
tions, but the ' Austin
American—Statesman, a Texas
newspaper, reported Monday
that airline records showed
that Pinkney flew to Los
Angeles May 6, and returned
May 10. -

However, Texas officials
said they too had reviewed the
airline reservations and did not
find Pinkney’s name.

“We are re-interviewing
Lovell about this,” Texas
Athletic Director -DeLoss
Dodds said. “He said earlier
that he didn’t go to LA. If
something turns up, we are
going to look into it.”

With controversy swirling
over the heads of the
Longhorns, they still have to

patch the huge gap of their '

starting receivers. A
Adams, a junior, was ranked
second among the nation’s
leading all-purpose yardage
performers. He was a consen-
sus first team All-SWC selec-
tion and an honorable mention
All-American. His 908 receiv-
ing yards landed him ninth in

_ the country. Adams averaged

17.2 yards every time he

touched the ball.

Pinkney, a 6—feet—5—inch
junior, is one of the fastest
players on the team. He was
ranked as the No. 10 receiver
in the nation by The Sporting
News, and was tabbed an hon-
orable mention All-American
by Street and Smith. Together,
Pinkney and Adams combined
to form the Longhorns’ top
receiving tandem in school
history.

In addition to Texas’ loss of
their top receivers, they also
will be without back—ups Justin‘
McLemore and Wane
McGarity, as well as starting
running back Darrell Wilson,
who are all out with injuries.

“In 30 years of coaching,”
Mackovicsaid, “I have never
faced a more difficult time as
we have endured over the last

several weeks both on and off ‘

the field. We have had
unprecedented injuries to sev-
eral key players, and now we
have an eligibility issue as

essarily mean she is healthy.

“Carrie is not in playing
shape yet,” Alvear said. “She
has lost four to six inches on
herjump.

“Just because they are
cleared to play doesn’t mean
everything is hunky-dory.

. They’re 100 percent cleared to

play; that doesn’t mean they
are 100 percent healthy.”

However, Thornton is sched-
uled to start in the first game
against Illinois State this
weekend.

Sophomore Laurie
Fernandez, who had shoulder
surgery, is also practicing.

“Laurie Fernandez is starting
to swing, but she can’t swing
60 times a game,” Alvear said.

“[The injured players] are
rusty. The haven’t had the reps
or worked out with the team.”

Alyssia Yanik, a 5—foot—ll
inch middle hitter, rounds off
the recuperated list.

Yanik, a sophomore, had
knee surgery last year. Just like
Fernandez and Thornton, she
is practicing, but she is not
quite ready.

“Yanik’s knee is fine,”
Alvear said, “but physically
she can’t hang.”

With multiple injuriesand
the season opener creeping
around the corner, Alvear
summed up the summer prac-
tices.

“The trainers have been
doing a greatjob,” Alvear said.
“They are getting people
ready.”

matter who starts just as long
as we win.’’

This type of attitude has
landed Pitt Pennsylvania’s
High school Player of the Year.

“When I came here on my
recruiting trip, all the players
were down to earth,” freshman’
free safety/quarterback Eric
Kasperowicz said. “At other
places the players were kind of
cocky. They didn’t have that
family atmosphere.”

Kasperowicz and ‘the. rest of
his teammates know that
things will not come easy to
them this year, but they are
willing to give their all.

“We are not going to think
about who is lined up in front
of us,” free safety David
Sumner said. “We as a football
team will give 100 percent no
matter if it’s Ohio State or
Ohio University. We are dedi-
cated to becoming a better
team, and we will not let any-
one step in our way.”

If the Panthers do exactly
what Sumner predicts, who
knows, the sky could be Pitt’s
limit. The Panthers return 18

. starters to go along with one of I
their best recruiting classes in

years. With this amount of tal-
ent along with a lot of heart,
the Panthers will improve_

Pennsylvania’s Eric
Kasperowicz, who has been
switched to defensive back,
chose Pitt for the opposite rea-
son.

Kasperowicz, North Hills
High School’s quarterback last
year, was selected USA Today
Pennsylvania Player of the
Year. He based his decision on
being close to home.

Another Pa. standout, Chris
Schneider, also chose to stay

in his backyard. The 255- '

pound fullback from Penn-
Trafford, could vie for playing
time with Chad Dukes this
year

The lone recruit at the tight
end position is John Jones.

Jones, originally from
Cleveland, was a two—year
starter at Glenn Mills (Pa.)

Standing 6-5 and weighing

“John is pretty good,” fel-

low tight end Dell Seagraves
said. “Right now his only
weakness is his blocking. But
he will establish that in the
weight room.”
