 Warsaw Professor: ReformistChange Likely in Poland

By FREDERICK BEERS‘

Pitt News Staff Writer

The most likely resolution for the

unrest in Poland is one of“reformist
change,” according to Dr. Jerzy
Wiatr, Director of the Institute of
Sociology at the University of
Warsaw.

Speaking here last week on the

Wiatr said those who think the sta-
tus qup _wil be restored are “wrong
and will be proved wrong.”

He added, however, that those
who think the changes arejust “hors
d’oeuvres" for a main course of more
radical change “will also be proved
wrong.”

“Poland is-not~going to switch
sides, it is not going to move from
the Warsaw Pact anywhere else, it’s
not goi-ng to be transformed into a
non-socialist state, and the party is
not going to lose—power,",Wiatr said.

He described as “naive and unsa-

"Kare1y has a country had such a

Poland had in the .l970's under
Gierek, but it is wrong to lay the
blame on him alone.”

He said these “leadership wea-

tices," were not the cause, but rather
“accelerated the crisis. ‘

“The real sources of the crisis are
structural” Wiatr offered, and said
theyican be interpreted in‘terms_of‘
three fundamental problems.

He identified these "as problems

Pitt’s Cathedral of Learning is
“the last great Gothic Revival build-
ing ever made," a Fine Arts profes-
sor said at Frick Art Gallery.

t With the Cathedral being such a
fine and prominent example of
Revival art, it is surprising that an
exhibition of Medieval art was not
pu_t'together sooner.

But a show of Medieval art and its
Revival is currently underway at the
Frick Fine Art Building‘ for no
charge. y

The display is the brainchild of
Associate Professor David Wilkins

-s who teaches painting.

Wilkins did graduate work on
Medieval and l9th century Ameri-
can art and “the two things seemed
to comeitogether when l was trying
to think ofa theme for the show,” he
said. ,

“As a scholar l’m interested in
what sorts of ideas the objects have
behind them,” he added.

‘The objects on display have been
loaned by Carnegie Institute, Arms
Museum in Youngstown, by several
churches in the area, and by various
private collectors. Some pieces are
from Wilkin’s own private collec-
tion. Other objects are owned by the
University.

The show combines two periods

in Western art. Medieval art begins»

in the Third century when Constan-
tine established Christianity as the
Roman Empire‘s state religion and
spans the period up to the Renais-
sance. The second period——the
Medieval Revival—-covers the l9th
and 20th centuries, he said.

The majority of the show deals
with the Medieval Revival, he
added.

The art of the Medieval period

was a unique reflection of society at’,

that time.

were really intendedfor the whole

About l,400 foreign students
attend Pitt, but processing these stu-
dents is not an easy job, especially
with a staff of IO. 3
“The Office of International Ser-
vices comes up against housing
problems that the studenthas,” said
Rhea Varriano, foreign, student
adviser. “There is a shortage and the
majority of t-he students are gradu-
ates, so there’s no campus housing
available to them. Also, some land-
lords take advantage of the foreign
student."
But another difficulty is finances.

Foreign students do not receive \

any type of aid from the university.
They either pay for it on their own or

society," Wilkins said.

Much of the artist‘s inspiration
during those Dark Ages was his
desire to praise God. he commented.

“The Church was the civilizing
factor, the intellectualizing factor,
the emotional factor, the release
from everyday work. So you find
this tremendous religious motiva-
tion that runs all the way through
the Revival," he added.

Medieval art was created primar-
ily by lower class craftsman who did
not sign their work. Monks in mon-
asteries were responsible for the
remainder of that period’s art, he
said.

“Most of it was produced incom-
munal workshops by people work-
ing together who did not think that
their contribution was such that they
should sign works of art,” Wilkins
said.

The Medieval Revival period was
“an attempt to recreate the romantic

‘atmosphere that was thought to
'exist during the Medieval period,”

Mathew Roper, assistant director of
Frick Gallery said.
“They ’were trying to fill their

houses with art to remind them— '

selves of a glorious past,” he added.

During the Medieval period art
“was not made for the commqp
man. It was made for the Church,”
Roper said. ’

Wilkins contrasted the Medieval
period of art with the Modern
period. .

“Medieval art was very beauti-.

fully made out of very beautiful
materials and was full of a kind of
content that was intended for a lot of
people. It was one ofthe great public
demonstrations of an idea that ran
through society,” he said, ‘

“In the Modern era we are talking
about an individual makinga kind

of art that is very satisfying to him. ..

Modern art is an’-expression of our
own selfishness and; our concern

with individual values,”  .

are ‘sponsored by their country. If
the student is sponsored _by "his

government,‘ he must agree to return
to his country afterward and must,_

in many cases, take a certain course

 of study. .

“We estimate that the average ’

undergraduate tuition will be $2,450
for the fall term, or $7,950 for the

year,” admissions adviser John W." ‘

Hindman explained. “And that

’doesn’t count living expenses.

“We have problems with the spon-

soring country as well,” he said,..

i “especially with Iran. Iran really

doesn’t want money to leave the

country, and so there is a lot ofplain .

old red tape to make it difficult for
the student. The forms must be filled
out in a certain way, in triplicate; if
not, the student can lose the money.”

  Comet

Pitt News Staff Writer

There's a Panther in the sky.

A new comet was sighted last
Christmas night by an English ama-
teur astronomer, Roy Panther
their

(comets are named after
discoverer).
Dr. Bruce Hapke, of Pitt’s

Astronomy Department, said that
amateurs with small telescopes dis-

‘ cover most comets—“a very special

service that amateurs do for us." ’
Panther can be easily seen until

‘ . the end of March. “it is moving

away from the sun, so it is getting
fainter," Hapke said. “it is easy to
spotlwith a small telescope or small
binoculars.” lt is too faint to be seen
with the naked eye.

To find the Panther comet, one
must first find the North Star.
Panther is slightly below and to the
left of the North Star.

The comet’s- official name is

Hapke said there is no way to tell
now if Panther will ever come back
and become a periodic comet, such
as Halley‘s Comet, which is due to
return in l986.

Hapke said that Panther is “on its
way back again" toward its origin,
which he said is probably beyond the
orbit of Neptune, one of the outer-
most plantet.

A comet‘ is “essentially a dirty
snowball-—balls of ice." Hapke said.
“They are very cold—-they spend
much time away from the sum.

As the comet approaches the sun,

concrete information. Cowell

added.

PAAR asked the Supreme Court
to guarantee rape victims in Penn-
sylvania the right to privacy in what
they might say to a rape counselor.
The Supreme Court ruled that in
order for information in the files to
be acceptable testimony, it must be
verbatim and approved by the vic-
tim. Since PAAR‘s information
does not exist in this form, Pride

, said they felt satisfied with the deci-

sion. However, in several Cases
across the state.judges have released
material which did not meet this
criteria.

continued from page one

Since this problem was not ade-
quately remedied through the court
system, the solution lieswithin the
legislature, Cowell said. 

“That is why a number of legisla-
tors are interested in providing some
type of statutory answer to this
problem,” Cowell explained.

Legislation has been in—troduced
to protect the rights of the rape vic-
tim by depriving defense attorneys
access to rape counseling center
files. House bills 509 and 2l3 are in
the House Judiciary Committee
awaiting consideration. Both bills
‘are designed to preserve the confi-

dentiality of communication
between the victim and the rape cri-
sis counselor. "

Currently, several interested legis-
lators, including Cowell, want the
chairman of the Judiciary Commit-
tee, Representative Spencer, to sche-
dule a meeting where this legislation
will-be considered.

“Most of us (legislators) believe

legislation in the Senate.

Those opposing the bill question
its constitutionality. According to
the Sixth Amendment, anything
that might help the defendent should
be made available. Ann Pride argues
that there is nothing in the Center's
records to help the defendent. A ver-
batim statement has been given to
the police and the District Attorney

'“The notes that we take are not
taken with the need to be accurate,"
says Pride.

Cowell advised the audience to
start to lobby for the bill in a demon-
stration of caring.

“Without this assurance of pri-
vacy, we will discourage victims
from obtaining this desperately
needed service. And that is a crime in

 

 

that if a meeting is held, if this legis-
lation is put on the agenda and con-
sidered, the bill will be released from
committee,” Cowell said. “If it is
released from committee, I believe it
will pass on the floor ofthe House,"
he added. Senator Howard of Bucks
County intends to introduce similar

involved, provided they cooperate
rather than fight."

Wiatr said it was the combination
of these three prolbmes that led to
the conflict, which, he added, was

“of a fundamental nature which“

excludes the_possibility of it being
resolved by cosmetic policy
changes.”

Going on to discuss what the crisis
will mean to the political system, he
urged systemic change “that estab-
lished a relationship between the
autonomous forces (the govern-
ment, trade unions and political

groups), rather than hegemony
\based on power."

Since the beginning of the crisis
last summer, he said the balance of
power within the ruling Communist
Party, has shifted to the side ofthe
reformers, and thattlieir demands
are being heard “very loudly."

He said there is general agreement
within the reformist wing that the
system should be based on a plural-
ist model, though he added thereare
some differences over specifics.

The reformers, he said, are being
challenged on three sides: by the
conservatives, who have “no resona-

ronlinuedfrom page one

bly coherent strategy,” and are con-
fined to efforts to slow the reform
process; by the radicals in the large
industrial and academic center, who
call for changes in the constitution;
and by the neo-conservatives who he
described as “populist hard-liners,
violently nationalistic, anti-semetic,
and anti-Soviet.“ ' '

Wiatr cited several reforms he
deems necessary in Poland, includ-
ing decentralization ofthe economy,
reallocation of resources for consu-
mer needs, reform of election laws,
and reform of the price and wage
system.

Time to Act

Why do students drop out of Pitt? The University
Retention Committee recently looked into this ques-
tion and came up with some interesting answers. In
addition, the committee recommended changes to cor-
rect the student drop out problem. ,

The retention committee has taken a vital first step
in recognizing retention problems and suggesting solu-
tions. However, its overall effectiveness will be deter-
mined by the changes that actually do occur.

According to the study, faculty -apathy is a major
reason why students leave school. A “Dormitory _
Study" conducted last april by the task force on Stu-
dent Faculty Relations indicated that a majority of
students surveyed said they have an instructor they
perceive as non-caring, or an instructor who is
unavailable during office hours.

College of General Studies students complained
their instructors have a lack of commitment to teach-
ing, and said they believe faculty’ members are more
interestedin research than teaching.

The report recommended that faculty members
hold a minimum number of office hours, for student’
conferences, and establish guidelines for class absen-
ces and grading procedures.

Associate Provost Robert Nossen, Retention Com-
mittee chairperson, said the committee is in the pro-
cess of implementing its analysis of the student
retention problem.

The actualization of its recommendations is the last
and most important step the committee must take.
Already» its work has been undermined to a degree by

‘ the reduction of the advisingcenter, an area the com-

.» mittee said was important in retaining students.

Hopefully, the committee’s other recommendations ' A)
will be taken much more seriously by Pitt
administrators. , ‘a

The problems and solutions have been recognized.
All that remains is for the university to take actionf

J 0urnalism’s Unfortunate Side

BY LARRY LUNSFORD

' _lt is rare that we would criticize a
member of the journalism profes-
sion for a job poorly done, but cur-
rently there is’ a court case against a
newspaper in which we side with the
plaintiff. The case is the $10 million
libel suit by actress Carol Burnett
against the National Enquirer.

 The case went trial this week in a
Los Angeles courtroom and stems
from a I976 column in the Enquirer
which Ms. Burnett claims libeled

. her.- The article, which said the

actress had been drinking heavily,
read in part: “At a Washington res-
taurant, a boisterous Carol burnett
had a loud argument with another
diner,_ Henry Kissinger. Then she

traipsed around the place offering»

everyone a bit of her dessert" and
?‘accidently knocked a glass of wine
over one diner and started giggling
instead of apologizing.” .

The Enquirer later printed a
retraction which admitted that the
“event did not occur.” Regardless of
the retraction, Burnett decided to
sue, and we congratulate her.

lt is the sensation-monger so—~

called newspapers like the Enquirer .

and the Star that contributelto the 4

bad reputation ofthe press. The arti-
cles in such newspapers or maga-
zines often defy’ all grounds of
common decency and use sensation-
alism to sell copies. Unfortunately

there are millions of readersglillible
enough to buy the newspapers and
magazines. ' ' ‘

Carol Burnett’s case is somewhat
special. For one, she is the. only
major celebrity to take on the
Enquirer in the courts and pursue
the matter through its ﬁnale. Most
cases against the Enquirer and other
such publications are settled out-of-

It has been a great experience to

and I have no comments to make on

case, the matter still isn’t pursued
because these cases take months and
usually years to settle, and the
demands on their time don’t allow
celebrities to stay with a case that
long.

Evidently, several other Holly-
wood stars are‘waiting in the wings
to learn the outcome of the Burnett
case. lf the actress  successful, we
can expect several other cases to be

_ filed against the sensation-mongers.
However, a defeat for Ms. Burnett ,

will be a step backward for press

freedom and not an affirmation of

the latter.

Naturally, attorneys for the
Enquirer claim the First Amend-
ment allows them to print what they
want and that Ms. Burnett was not
personally nor professionally hurt
by the libelous column. We disagree.
The Enquirer’s own interpretation
of the First Amendment is a gross
misrepresentation of press freedom.
A column was written in which the
facts were not checked, and the

‘author knew the charges to be false.
A retraction in such a ca-se is not-j

enough.

We have long promoted press

freedom and the peoples‘ right to
know, so we are obliged to criticize
when such a flagrant violation of
that precious right is made. Hope-
fully, the court will agree and rule in
favor of Carol Burnett.

America that would soon find an
expression in the hostile stance of
the Cuban revolution.

The U.S. economic hegemony in
Latin America in the l9‘50’s was
beyond doubt. ln the 1980s this is
no longer the case. The advances
made by Western Europe and Japan
have been considerable and the lead-
ing Latin American countries have
greatly‘ increased their strength.
Thus, even .more than in the fifties,
American political hegemony in
what President Reagan terms “our

backyard” has to rely on military-

power. The use of military assistance

Dear Editor‘:

l have been a student at Pitt for
thfee years. Next term I will be
entering the School of Engineering.
Without the help and guidance of
several advisors at the CAS Advis-
ing Center, my educational expe-
rience would have taken several
wrong and unfortunate .turns.
Because of their advice. I will spend
an extra year at Pitt so that I can
acquire both a liberal arts education
and an engineering degree. The
extra’s years tuition will be well
worth ‘the educational experience

which my advisors helped me to I

design. ,

The Advising Center is valuable
to the undergraduates, because the
university is such a large and com--
plex world of possibilities.vln it. the
Center’s value is unquestionable.

This term 1 will leave the Advising
Center behind for the most part. But
leaving doesn’t mean that i don’t
care if the administration cuts out
the only peopfe who are available to
help us on a personal and daily basis.
I want to see the same valuable ser-
vice retained for my nine brothers
and sisters who are coming behind

 Six Pantherettes Named All-Americans

J By SEAN BARNES

Pitt News Sports Writer

' The largest women‘s team ever to
represent Pitt Pantherettes at
Nationals came home from South
Carolina Sunday with six ofthe nine
women having gained All-American

status. For Senior Su‘2anne Pulley, it .

was a Pitt athletic landmark, as her
name is put on the list with former
swimmer Kathy Stetler and football
stars Tony Dorsett and Hugh Green
as Pitt's only four-year All-
Americans, according to Pitt coach
Dick Bradshaw.

Swimming with Pulley in the All-
America 400-yard freestyle relay,
the l2th fastest in college today, was
Amy Jackson, Jan Ujevich, and
Linda Frankenbach. Pitt's All-
America 800-yard freestyle relay
teamed the same four swimmers as
the 400-yard freestyle relay, with the
exception of Sue Heon replacing
Pulley. These five swimmers, along
with Pitt diver Julie DeHaven all
gained All-American status as they
placed in the top l6 in the nation in
their events.

Individually, Jackson_ took sev-
enth in the 100-yard butterﬂy as

_ expected, but missed All-America

status in the 50-yard butterfly. For
Ujevich, it was All-American honors
in every event she swam. She placed
eleventh in the I00-yard individual
medley, and 12th in the 200-yard
individual medley and
freestyle. Ujevich reflected after-
wards, “I had hoped to do better,

l00-ya rd '

.9995:

 

Pantherette Nancy Henry was a participant at Nationals, held in South Carolina last

weekend.

since during this season l was doing
even better than last year. But it was
a very fast National meet.”

Ujevich qualified in eight individ-
ual events and all five relays, but the
meet limit of three individual events

  
 
 
 
  
    

and two relays kept her from swim-
ming two of the freestyle events as
well as.all three breastroke events.
Ujevich is looking forward to next
. year to see Pitt's new recruits, but for
now, the swimmers will take some

time off before they begin their off-
season summer training.
The sixth All-American, -diver

Julie DeHaven, “should be ‘congrat-

ulated for such consistency on the_
three-meter board, considering her

/

condition" said Pitt diving coach
Julian Krug. DeHaven hurt her big
toe Tuesday evening the night
before Nationals started, which
resulted in a blister under her toenail
that gave her pain injust walking, let
alone bouncing accurately on a div-
ing board. Krug expected DeHaven
to make All-American and was

pleased to see her place fifteenth ‘on’
the three-meter board, considering’

she had to ice her foot between dives.
DeHaven was the only woman diver

in the Eastern Conference to qualify ,

for Nationals. and returns to try
again next year. DeHaven is only a
sophomore and looks forward to her
two more seasons under coach
Krug. J
Overall,‘Texas~won the meet by

upsetting last year's winner, Stan---

‘ford, followed by North Carolina
State in third. Pitt’s one loss during
the I980-8l season was to
N.C.State. ln fourth and fifth were
Arizona. State and Florida respec-
tively, as Pitt took l9th overall out
of the 70 teams that competed.

Now that the women’s swimming
and diving season has ended, Brad-
shaw and Krug will spend their time
recruiting. April 8th is the first day
recruits may sign a binding letter of
intent. Although the loss of seniors
Suzanne Pulley and Bonnie Durdy
will_hurt, the sport of swimming—
especially iwomen’s, has advanced
remarkably. More and more high
schools have added swimming pools
to their existing facilities, and are
turning out more and more fine col-

legiate swimmers. N

Penn St. for.N/0. 2

By ANNA ARLOTTA

' Pitt News Sports Writer
The»Pitt Panthers men’s volley-

" ‘ball team will have one oftheirmost

important confrontation of their
initial Division l season tonight. The

opponent—the Nittany Lions of.

Penn State—is one of the most awe-
some teams in the East.‘ The 7 p.m.
contest at the Field House will pose
as a prime opportunity in the regular
season for the Panthers to get ajump
‘in the rankings on their Division 1
competition. Penn State is ranked,

second in the East, followed by No. 3

' Pitt. ' . ’

The,Nittany Lions will certainly
be in no mood for another defeat—_
they ‘are coming off two recent lo_sses
to Ohio State last week.’ Penn State,
under the instruction of ;veteran
head ‘coach Tpm Tait, will be look-
ing at tonight’s match with the rival
Panthers as a chance to get back in,
the win column that they arei'"so “
accustomed to . '

“This .is the best chancethat we
will have of knocking them off,” said
Pitt coach Ray Reilly.” “Facing
them on our home court will give us
a mental advantage added to the fact
that Penn State is coming off two.
losses to powerhouse Ohio State.”

The Panthers are at their highest

peak soimfar this season and after"
- their latest competition last weekend

‘ at the Eastern Collegiate Volleyball

4 League open tournament’where the”

Panthers decisively took first-place
honors. The win at the ECVL’s put"
the Panthers up emotionally after

their disappointing loss to No. 1

ranked Rutgers-Newark the pre-

vious night, ’  i

    
   
 

We are a whole new team now, since

the ECVL championships.\The first i
_half of the season is immaterial now, ‘
if the manner in which we played at

the tournament holds up, we should

/do very well.” V

gave Baird, Brian Devine and Bill-

The best of five match may find
the Nittany Lions displaying anew
offense from their usual V4-2 form.
Penn State has beenusing two set-
ters in theircontests but may be
experimenting with a 5-1, leaving
only one setter against Pitt. " _

A number of the Penn State spik-
ers come from Western Pennsylva-
nia and have competed against some
Panther players since high school. ‘

.Senior captain andtsetter Mike
Gordon from Penn Hills, a standout
with"~the ‘Nittany ~Li_6ns for four
years, will becompeting against a
former teammate, Panther Danny
O’.Donnell. 0’Donnell is one of-

. many [Western - Pennsylvanian

Panthers. H'e‘,is joined by starters

nuth. The past rivalry should add
very nicely to the present one and.

, make for a very hard fought contest.

The Nittany Lions will be compet-

ing in a USVBA‘ match at Rec Hall V

all day Saturday where they w'ill«be

playing. against most’ of ‘ the top‘ .

USVBA teams in eight-team to_urna-'

Despite the cold and snow of

When Pitt spring football drills
begin today at Pitt Stadium,
Panther coach Jackie Sherrill will

perhaps his biggest challenge since
assuming the headjob at Pitt four
seasons ago.

Sherrill if he gets a bit offensive.

starters—nine alone from the
nation's best defefisei For thexfirst
time in Sherrill’s head coaching
tenure, offense should dominate the
Panther’s personality ‘and ultimately
V determine their success this season.

Returning" from last, year is the
potent aerial attack’ spearheaded by
quarterback Dan Marino and
ﬂanker Dwight Collins, Pitt's most
explosive receiver since All-
American Gordon Jones. Collins
smashed most of Jones’ freshman
receiving records last year, including

_the record for most touchdown
receptions. Collins hauled in I3
touchdown catches last season to
break the old record of ll.

Most of Pitt’s hopes‘ on offense
hinge on how well Marino can
rebound from the surgery to con-
tinue directing Pit,t’s ‘passing attack,
which at times last season was awe-

drills until later in the spring, arid‘the
extent of his recovery may not be
fully determined until Pitt’s pre-' "V C

,‘March 23. 1981

 

Sherrill Rebuilding as Football Drills Begin

continued from page eleven
players don’t meet Sherrill’s
standards.

A strong showing on offense by
incoming freshman Bill Fralic, the
highly regarded two-way lineman
and high school All—American from
Penn Hills, could facilitate a switch
of Boures to center during fall drills.
However, Sherrill has not publicly
stated which side of the line Fralic
will play at Pitt.

In the back field, Pitt returns
sophomore Joe McCall, who
showed ﬂashes of promise last sea-
son for Pitt after winning the start-
ing tailback position from Rooster
Jones. Wayne DiBartola, coming
off an injury-plagued l980 season,
should assume the fullback spot
vacated by Randy McMillan,
another Panther expected to be a
high NFL draft choice. Sophomore
Marc Bailey, a high school All-
American who saw little action for
Pitt last season. could press DiBar-
tola for the fullback job.

ln the receiving corps, Collins is
cemented in the flanker slot, and
junior Julius Dawkins should finally
emerge to take the starting split end
position, although he'll have to win
it over another junior, Keith Willi-
ams. At the tight end, Benjie Pryor

and Mike Dombrowski are gone, so.

junior Dennis Ballard returns as the
candidate with the most experience.
Junior speedster John Brown, who
was switched to tight end from
ﬂanker, may lack size to be a block-
ing force on the line. Brown was

listed at 6-4, 200 pounds last season,
but if he continues to beef up this
summer, he could win the tight end
job in the fall.

It remains to be seen how much
the loss of offensive coordinator
Wally English will affect the Pitt

offensive attack. English, who left \

Pitt tojoin the coaching staff ofthe
Miami Dolphins, was the major
architect of Pitt’s complex and
highly effective offensive attack last
season, which used multiple offen-
sive sets and motion to produce
Pitt’s potent passing attack. English
came to Pitt in l979 from Brigham
Young, where quarterback Marc
Wilson led the nation in passing in
I978.

On defense, only senior Sal Sun-
seri and sophomore Tom Flynn are
returning starters. Sunseri is set at
one linebacker spot, but the other
starting job is up for grabs; senior
Yogi Jones and junior Ray Lao are
the frontrunners. Junior Rich Kray-
nak has benn switched from defen-
sive line to linebacker and could also
press for the starting job.

In the secondary, Flynn is likely to
retain his free safety job, and senior
Pappy Thomas should win one of
the starting cornerback spots. At
strong safety, junior Dan Short,
who saw some spot duty last season,

‘ and junior Pat McQuaide will prob-

ably compete for the starting strong
safety position. The other corner-
back is probably up for grabs
between sophomore Troy Hill and

.,‘_ Senior shortstop Marc Massa, was
" the team’s Most Valuable Playerlast

year. The centerfield position will be
filled by two newcomers, Doug
Steiner and Dennis Stitch, but both
have potential for strong, solid per-
formances, according to Lewis.

Lewis assessed overall team speed
as good. Glenn Howe, Mike Fitzpa-
trick, Darrell Gissendanner and
Stitch provide the heart ofthe team’s
quickness. ‘‘ A

“We want to do different things
offensively," Lewis said. “We can

' run and hit and steal bases to create
a big inning."
The primary area of concern for
. Lewis is overall hitting. The poten-
tial is there. Most ofthe players have
grown stronger and have put on
weight. Lewis is counting on more
power hitting fromithe No.3 through
No/.6 slots in the batting order. That
is where the runs will be driven in,
said Lewis.
The Panthers have a good bench,

according to Lewis. The key to their
bench is the versatility ofthe players.
Different people are capable ofplay-
ing different positions. Jon Adams
and Robert Friedman play most of
the infield positions. Steiner plays
both infield and outfield.

“Once we start playing outdoors,”
said Lewis, “we’ll eliminate the
mechanical ’ mistakes. You can
hardly fault a kid for missing a ball

on a bad hop when he hasn’t played-

outside. We have to eliminate the
mental mistakes.”

Lewis reiterated that his pitching
staff has to produce. He wants the
starters to be able to go all the way
without relief help. If the Panthers
are able to score more runs and the
pitching continues to be strong, that
will be the difference for the team.

“We have a good schedule,” Lewis
sa_id. “We play the E.A.A. (Eastern
Athletic Association) teams this
year. We might lose some games but
no team will out—hustle us."

The Panthers will be looking to
