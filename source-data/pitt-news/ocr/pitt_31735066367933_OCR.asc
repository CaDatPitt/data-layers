Liddy, Leary Debate Personal Freedom

By RAY WUSLICH

Watergate mastermind G. Cor-
don Liddy and drug advocate
Timothy Leary set the tone for last
night’s debate by disagreeing from
the very start on how they first met.

“As you will observe this even-
ing, Dr. Timothy Leary and Idis—
agree on just about everything and
that includes how we first met.”
Liddy said.

The two then went on to give
their own versions about a night in
October, 1966 when then-CIA field‘
marshall Liddy led a drug raid on
I..eary’s home in Milbrook, N.Y.,
thus beginning the acquaintance.

Donnie Iris, above, and B.E. Taylor are the headliners tor
Pitt’s annual Homecoming Concert on Oct. 15. The event is
sponsored by the Pitt Program Council.

The se_ll—out audience was assured
of a debate with much
disagreement.

The two hour debate, which was
sponsored by the Pitt Program
Council. was entitled, “Personal
Freedom vs. The Right of the
State." Liddy argued that the right
of the state and the common good
of society, goes beyond the rights of
individuals because a strong state
will help citizens achieve their
individual goals. A

“Groups have hierarchical rank-
ings more important than others,”
Liddy said. “The state being the
highest because it is necessary for
the protection of everyone in

society."

“A university is not necessary to
achieve education. You can edu-
cate yourself in a garage with a lot
of books." Liddy said.

Leary took the side of personal
freedom superceding states’ rights.
His argument was directed toward
the youths in the audience, particu-
larly the college students.

“Don‘t trust anyone born before
1946," Leary said. “Don’t trust
anyone who hasn’t changed his or
her mind since 1946." "‘

He went on to say that states have
no rights, and that only “tempor-
ary instructions" that the tax pay-
ers give to “our servants—-the

presidents, the generals and the
admirals” have rights.
Concerning ‘personal rights,
Leary said he believes that people
have the right to experiment with
drugs in the privacy of their own’
hornes. He said that in the past few
months, both he and his wife have
tried new kinds of psycho—active
drugs.
In the future, Leary said, people
will be more educated about.drugs.
. “I'm basicallya student of evolu-
tion and a deep believer in evolu-
tion,” Leary said. “My attitude

Voter Reg
Campaign

By AMY MEYER

Several student organizations
on campus are constructing
plans for a voter registration
drive for the upcoming congres-
sional and gubernatorial races

in Pennsylvania.

I The Student Government
Board, the Governmental Rela-
tions Committee and the Col-
lege Young Democrats are
working together to get Pitt stu-
dents to register to vote in
Allegheny County on Nov. 

The big races this year are for
governor of Pennsylvania with
Democrat. Alan lirtel challeng-
ing incumbent Richard Thorn-
burgh and Sen. John Heinz
being challenged by Dr. Cyril
Wecht. There are also other
congressional races in various
districts around the county.

To be eligible to vote, a stu-
dent must be 18 years of age, a
citi'1.en and a resident of Allegh-
eny County for at least 30 days.
The registration deadline is
Oct. 4.

For students who wish to vote
in their own county races,»

Beg i n s
be obtained by calling the
Allegheny County Council
Comrnunity Information Cen-
ter. That deadline is Oct. 29.

According to a report in a
November 1980 issue of U.S.
News and World Report, 38
percent of the U8. population
did not register . to vote that
year—a presidential election
year. Fifty-eight percent of the
non-voters were in the 18-24
range, the age of many college
students.

Dr. Michael Margolis, a Pitt
political science professor, said
these statistics are present for a
number of reasons.

“Primarily, the under—25 age
group isn’t settled in a particu-
lar community,” he said. “They
don’t have the same stakes in
the community that other citi-
zens do.”

Margolis elaborated by say-
ing. that that age group usually
does not pay taxes or have large
families to support. Young peo-
ple only get involved, he said, 5,
when an issue directly concerns
them. Even then, only a minor-
ity of ' young people are
involved.

Liddy and Leary: Two Friends On The Debate Tour

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

The Great Debate is now
history.

What had the potential of
being a mud slinging battle
had it been held 15 years ago,
turned out to be an enter-
taining and educational

I evening for the sellout crowd

at Soldiers and Sailorslast
night.

Watergate mastermind G.
Gordon Liddy and a hero of
the" l960’s drug culture Dr.
Timothy Leary debated last

night in a Pitt Program

Council-sponsored event
entitled, “Personal Freedom
vsrg The Right of the State.”

There was no “winner” of
the - d_ebate,'°‘except the
audience who was witness to
two ideological rivals
expressing their obvious dif-
ferences in regard to such
issues as national defense,
drugs and the youth of
America. D

After the debate, in an
interview with The Pitt
News both men admitted
they are close personal
friends and stage the event to
inform, as well as entertain,
the college-age audiences.

Liddy said he liked the
man he once arrested for pos-

sessi‘on of marijuana and

Leary said Liddy is “a good
friend to have.” Both men
said they liked the other’s
intensity as a human being.

While the debate was fun
and good-natured, it was
also a lesson in the political
spectrum of the nation. Both
men said the humor that was
present in the debate is
needed.

L “Education, entertain-
ment and advertising must
go together,” Leary said. “A
successful teacher must keep
his audience alive and pres-
ent it like it’s a production so
it’s attractive.”

G. Gordon Liddy onceiarrested Timothy Leary for posessionof mariiuana. Despite "19" id90'°9i°3' dmefeﬂcesa h0W'éVef.i

the twosay they are friends.

The debate has been held
at universities all over the
nation and even, Liddy said,
as a show on Broadway.

The first debate held
between the two occurred on
Oct. 31, 1981' in Texas aftera
counter-culture friend of
Leary’s suggested that the
two get together.

Leary said since he spent

four years in prison——more

time than any other of his

peers—and Liddy spent five,

years in prison a long time
for a “conservative”—they
had a lot in common and
could relate to one another
better because of their prison
experiences.

Liddy mentions Leary a
number of times in his auto-
biography, “Will,” and

Liddy said last night he
will not appeal the govern-
ment’s decision to seize
profits from his book sales
and lectures. He said he’s
waited so long to pay that
fine because he wanted to
first payback lawyers and
others who helped him.
“They have families to
feed,” Liddy said.

Photos by John
Armour .,

Leary also mentions Liddy
in some of his books. That,
Leary said, is another reason
theyigot together.

Liddy, who lectured solo
at Pitt-in late 1980, recently
had profits of his book and
lectures seized by the Justice
Department because he
owed the government
$40,000, for a jail fine when
_he was convicted of the
Watergate conspiracy.

Liddy said he is paying the
fine and has no intention of
appealing the ruling. He
said he waited so long
because he wanted to pay off
his lawyers and others who
helped him because “they
have families to feed” where
the government would only
give it for some military
building.

Liddy said he still keeps in
contact with some of the
other people involved in
Watergate and corresponds
with former president
Richard Nixon but said he
has no intention of going
back into government
service.

“I’m a practical person,”
he said. “Theoretically, it’s
possible (to go back to
government) but realisti-
cally it’s impossible. Too
many people know me.”

While he is not lecturing,
Liddy is in charge of an
industrial investigating-
espionage firm based in
Miami and is involved with
filmmaking. He is currently
writing and developinga tel-
evision show for one of the
cable networks.

Leary, in his spare time,
writes books. He just fin-
ished his autobiography
entitled, “Flashbacks” and
said he tries to write at least
one book a'year.

The two are personally»

different, as well as ideologi-
cally different. While Leary
walked around the stage in a
casual sweater, casual pants
and tennis shoes, Liddy
remained almost still in his
conservative business suit.

Both debators were wel-
comed with rousing
applause, although Lidd’s
introduction ’was greeted
with a few boos and catcalls
from the audience.

The debate held the atten-
tion of the audience because

of its pace and me jokes and I

slight insults traded between
the two.

Perhaps the biggest laugh
came when Liddy’s micro-
phone failed for a few
seconds and he remarked, “I
always have problems with
microphones.”

“In the future I think that people
will be educated so that they will

learn to program it. Drugs are

future because people will be more

Liddy and Leary Debate Personal Freedom

“We need governmental control
of guns and drugs," Leary
explained. "The problem with
guns and drugs is that stupid peo-
ple use drugs and guns stupidly.
Drug users should l)e licensed and
allowed to usethem only so longas
they use them intelligently."

To Leary, the world is divided
into people who do use drugs and
know everything abottt them, and
people who don't. Liddy, except
for morphine administered to him
while he was in an Army hospital,
is on the side that doesn't.

“I agree with Leary's analogy, at

least partially,” Liddy said, “that

the htnnan brain is compttter—like.
But if you threw water on the recep-
tors you could say that they were
receiving the water, but of course
what you would be doing would l)e
short circttiting the computer.

“Which is what I think one does
when one ingests psycho-active
substances. And so the brain, under
their influences, starts saying, ‘two
plus two equals nine. two plus two
equals nine’ and you wake up in
the morning convinced you have
found the secret of the universe,"
Liddy said.

The two also disagreed about the
importance of a strong national

defense. Liddy argued that a
nttclear free/.e is illogical, and that
if the country doesn't defend itself
it will be taken advantage of.

“If you have a littleold lady with
a fat pocketbook out here at 2:30
a.m., in a bad neighborhood, she
will rather quickly be relieved of
that pocketbook," Liddy said.

"If you have a young man who is
the offensive tackle for Pittsburgh,
he‘s 6'7" and weight 270 pounds,
he has a fat wallet but in his left
hand he ha_s a baseball bat and in
his right he has a Thompson sub-
machine gun, he’ll keep his wallet.

“That is what maintaining the

 

strength of the U.S. is all about."

To Leary, however. the choices
are not so clear cttt.

“I'm concerned, Gordon, that
you think the choices we have is
that America is going to l)e a little
old lady being mugged in the
streets, or we have to be an offensive
tackle with a machine gun," Leary
said.

The sell—out crowd waited for the
debate to start at least an hour
before it was scheduled. People
who did not have tickets stood in
the rain in hopes of finding extras
and scalpers reportedly received
$20 for one ticket.

The Pitt News, WednesdaySeptember 22, 1982

By MICHAEL ROKNICK

In arecent article in The New
York Times it was announced
that the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration
(NASA) has had a regulation
since 1969 to “protect you from
extraterrestrial exposure at the
hands of any person, property,
animal or other form of life or
matter whatever.”

court order.” ‘

This rule, which is not yet
law, could in effect circumvent
the United States Constitution
and the civil rights laws, the
foremost of these being that if
an alien were to land in this
country, he would be denied the
right to be charged and judged
by his peers.

The case can be made that the
U.S. government might have a

it to say that the movie has

some may argue anyone who acts like they do should also be subject to NASA extraterrestrial regulations.

    

The article goes ’on to
explain that the original plans
for this rule were for the
manned space flights to the
moon. The idea anticipated
that the men returning from
their voyage might bring back
“some form of life that could
prove threatening on Earth”. It
also stated that a NASA spokes-
man said that these regulations,
which would at best temporar-
ily suspend constitutional and
civilrights, would apply to any
being that arrived on. this
planet via spaceship.

The rules explain that the
NASA administrator would be
able to’ determine, “with or

this. However, the public out-

the department held responsi-
ble, for the implementation of
any rules adopted toward
extraterrestrials. I

In a phone interview with
NASA’s public affairs division,
it was revealed that there may
have been a mistake in the orig-
inal interpretation of the rule.
A spokesman for the agency
stated that NASA has a quaran-
tine law in order to protect the
environment, l)ut this regula-
tion was supposed to have only
applied to NASA’s spacecraft
returning to the earth from an
outer space voyage.

“It’s a moot point if an l:I.T.
comes down here,” said the
spokesman. “We don’t have a
policy to grab as one-eyed

monster. The quarantine
procedures that are on the
books belong to NASA
exclusively.”

When asked what would be
done if an alien did indeed land
on Earth, the spokesperson re-
plied, “If an E.T. would come,
we would contact the Defense
Department and the president
to see what should be done.”

‘If an E. T. would
come, we would con-
tact the Defense
Department and the
president to see what
should be done.’

The spokesman also said he
did not see the movie “E.T.,”
but still, “It would be pretty far-
fetched to communicate by tele-
phone to another planet.”

Though NASA is trying to
exonerate. itself from the ruling,
there is still speculation among

 fans that it may be imple-

mented. Fans may give their

opinions about the ruling by

If 1982 enrollment figures are any
indication, Pitt is benefitting from
the higher costs of attending pri-
vate in_stitutions.

The College of Arts and Sciences
registered a 3 percent increase,
engineering dropped 5 ‘xi and nurs-
ing saw a 4 percent rise compared
to 1981. These statistics are based
on paid, admitted students.

Transfer student enrollment
increased by 3 percent and the over-

more than 3 if percent.

_Joseph Merante, director of
admissions, said transfer enroll-
ment tripled this term.

“Most students have come from
private institutions and because of
this, the quality of transfers is 
Merante said. “They see Pitt’s pro-
grams as better than other universi-,

where cost equals prestige," he

indicated.

In the College of Arts and Scien-
ces, more than 1,800 freshmen
enrolled, which is what the school
usually takes in each year. Over
7,000 are presently enrolled, mak-
ing it the school with the highest
enrollment. CAS dean Irwin J.
Schulman was pleasantly sur-
prised about the latest figures.

“One thing that is interesting is
that around the turn of the decade,
we started planning for sharp
declines
1979 was the peak year in terms of
the number of people graduating
in this area, with the decline to lin-
ger until l990. Actually, though,
our enrollment has slowly been

creeping upward the last three
years.

“And this comes despite the fact
that fertility rates (the number of
children per household) have been
declining since the mid-70s and
that there is an expected particu-
larly sharp downswing of Western
Pennsylvania graduates projected
in the 1990s as compared to 1980 -
as much as 35 to 40 percent lower,”
Schulman said. -

According to Schulman, the tui-
tion gap between the public and
private institution is ever-
widening, forcing many to attend
Pitt when they might have other-
wise considered such schools as
Westminster, CMU or Allegheny.

A second important factor,

‘Schulman said, is the economy.

Dormitory and meal expenses add
to the cost of an education.

There is also an untapped popu-
lation potential considering earn-
ing a degree, Schulman said.

“Of the area high school gradu-
ates, only 50 percentcontinue on to
college as compared to 60 percent
in the rest of the nation," Schul-
man said. “Poor economic condi-
tions force many more to consider
what colleges, in general, and Pitt,
in particular, have to offer — espe-
cially at low cost. Also, financial
aid is quite attractive to low-
income families.”

The CAS dean mentioned wides-
pread federal aid cuts that deter stu-
dents from attending even low-cost
schools.

“The Reagan cuts,” Schulman
stressed, “have hit the lower-

don’t mean just in education.
There is a whole degree of eco-
nomic cutbacks reaching into food

“Accordingly, there is more

apathy. Seeing that they cannot —

afford a child’s education, due to
other far-reaching factors, indiffer-

ence sets in. So, minority enroll-.

ment has dropped and a top-of-the-

head explanation shows that the '

white middle-class student is least
likely to be at the bottom. An
increase in performance results.”
results."

The ultimate effect of the econ-
omy, though, Schulman noted, is
that Pitt is, in effect, becoming a
private institution. It is becoming
an ideal that Pitt is only available
to the middle class.”

A Pitt freshman who flunked a
chemistry course registered for the
next course in that sequence and
spent the first few weeks of the term
attending it. It wasn't until after
the deadline for the add-drop
period passed that she realized she
shouldn't have taken the course,
and instead should be repeating the
one she had failed.

Such a situation is “totally unne-
cessary” and could be prevented if
students paid attention to dead-
lines and published information
about University procedures,
according‘ to Beverly Harris-
Schenz, assistant (lean of the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences.

Almost all important registra-
tion deadlines, such as add-drop,

Advice on Avoidi

have passed. Today is the last day
students can register for the credit-
no entry option.

Those who missed these dead-
lines or just discovered they are reg-
istered incorrectly will find
straightening things out is not a
simple process.

According to Harris-Schenz, the
first thing a student should do is to
act quickly.

“At least do something right
away," Harris-Schenz said._ “The

' situation isn’t going to get better as

it gets older.’

Although the dean’s office can’t
change a student’s registration, it
can recommend that the registrar
take certain actions. For example, a
student who misses an add-drop
deadline because of health or fam-

 

n9
Iems y

ily reasons may receive support
from that office.

llowever, if students miss (lead-
lines because of negligence, there’s
nothing the dean's office will do.

“If the reason for inissinga dead-
line is negligence, that’s‘the stu-
dent’s problem,” Harris-Schenz
said. “There’s no reason why that
should be an issue. The majority of
the students make the deadlines, so
it’s not fair to allow others to get
under them."

She added that deadlines for reg-
istration, add-drop and other Uni-
versity deadlines are well
published and available in the stu-
dent catalogue.

For the future, Harris-Schenz
advised that students could avoid
problems by making sure they use
the right course alpha code when
registering. Listing the wrong
alpha code for a course will mean
the student will be registering for
an entirely different. course and
having an alternate course availa-

ble when add-dropping or
registering. . «
“People in line don’t know

whether or not the course they
want will be closed,” Harris-
Schenz said. If they already have an
alternate course selection they'll be
able to complete the registrations
or add-drop right away, which is
especially vital on the last day of
add-drop.

Have a special permission slip, if
needed. On the last day of add-
drop, a student who needs a special
permission slip to register for a
course may have to spend the after-

noon chasing down a professor and
missing the dealine.

Also bring the right things when
registering, such as the class confir-
mation cards. Linda Burns, an
assistant to Dean Schulman, said
those cards are sent to students, but
some will complain that they never
got them. It’s a student’s responsi-
bility to ensure the registrar has his
or her correct address so that the
card will be delivered.

Keep copies of everything.
“Things will run smoother" if you
keep copies of your registrations,
bill and add-drop in case a problem
crops up,‘ Harris-Schenz said.

Make academic use of the add-
drop period. According to Harris-
Schenz, many students waste their
two week add-drop period because
they don’t spend that time sain-
pling and choosing courses. Too
often, she said, a student will
decide he or she doesn't like a
course and will have to scramble to
find an alternative‘.

Burns added that picking up a
class at the end of the add-drop
period can hurt a student’s aca-
demic performance in the class.

“Professors don’t appreciate stu-
dents walking into their courses
after two weeks," she said.

Campus Crime

College students can get inex-
pensive medical aid and coun-
seling at the Pittsburgh Free
Clinic which is geared towards
the lower income and 13-30-
year-old patients. _

The clinic, in its 12th year of
operation, renders services to
many college students, accord-
ing to Sharon Cunniff, admin-
istrating manager of the clinic.

“We do have a large student
population at Pitt, Carnegie-

Mellon University and
Duquesne University," she
said. ‘

Cunniff said there are no age,

geography or financial restric-

tions to receive clinical
assistance.

She added that the confiden-
tiality, professional health care
and frelaxed atmosphere help to

‘attract many different incomes
and age groups.

The services offered at the
clinic are not totally free, but
cost is based on a sliding scale to
provide for different levels of
income, according to Cunniff.

The clinic’s Birth Control
and Adolescent Health Pro-
grams are funded indirectly by
the government through Fam-

General Medical Clinic, soley
staffed by volunteer, is sup-
ported by patient fees and indi-
vidual donations, according to
Cunniff. Because of Reagan's
cutbacks, “We are working on a
reduced budget and staff this
year,” said Cunniff.

The clinic offers several pro-

grams which include patient
education. _

The Birth Control Program
provides gynecological care,
counseling and contraceptives.

The General Clinic, on Mon-

“anti-Soviet agitation and pro-
paganda." She was released in
December 1975.

Karavansky and her husband

. Opinion    

Assessing

  Responsibility

The mass butcheringgof Palestinian refugees over
the weekend has been condemned around the world.
Details are still emerging and it is still not known
how many men, women and children were gunned
down in the refugee camps of Shatila and Sabra by
Israeli trained and armed Christian Phalangists.

The question of Israel’s. involvement is a critical
one. i ‘

Evidence suggests that senior Israeli military corri-
manders and government officials knew the slaugh-
ter was going on 24 to 36 hours before the Israeli

, army acted to put a halt to the killing. The events

took place within view of one of the main Israeli
observation posts in west Beruit, 100 yards away.

' The Phalangists entered the camp area by passing

through Israeli lines; the Israeli decision to let them
in in itself violates the spirit of the agreements’

_ worked out by American envoy Philip Habib. In

addition, Israeli authorities have been quoted as say-

, ing that they knew in advance that the Phalangists

were planning to enter the camps, but never thought

- that such a massacre would occur. Even early in the

war, Israel’s Defense Minister Ariel Sharon had
voiced many times that he hoped that the Phalan-
gists would go into west Beruit and “clean” the area
of PLO guerillas.

Due to conflicting reports on all sides, however,

- Israel’s role is unclear. An inquiry into the massacre

has been ordered by the Israeli government.

Many officials are now holding that Israel is
“indirectly responsible” for what took place over the
weekend. I

Aware of the bloody history of hatred between the
Phalangists and the Palestinians, it should have
been obvious that the Phalangists would murder
Palestinian ‘civilians if allowed into the camps. T

The Israeli press has harshly criticized the fact that
Israel did not lift a finger. The jerusalem Post
wrote: “...we have all been accomplices to the horri-
ble Roshha-Shanah massacre of West Beruit.” ,

If it is compatible with the idea of being indirectly
responsible, then perhaps the United States can also
be considered the same. Military actions of all mag-
nitudes are made possible because the money to carry
them out exists. The U.S. is a clearinghouse of
weapons for Israel. We provided them with the clus-
ter bombs and the F-165, the legitimate uses of which
are still being investigated. The weapons the U.S.
has supplied to Israel aresupposedly not to be used
except for defensive purposes, but as we have seen,
the meaning of defense is easily muddled and
redefined. V '

Israel receives over $2 billion a year in foreign aid
from the U.S. Considering what this aid is paying
for, the entire question of U.S.. aid to Israel should be
reconsidered, or at least made conditional.

sauna slowly opens, and as the
steam escapes, in walks Les

Coyotes, anew NFL expansion

casually glances at his newly bulg-
ing waistline, then at Socrates.

“Hey man, that’s one bad look-

nervously.

“No thanks, Ijiist took the Pepsi

“Suit yourself," he said, twisting

.“Isn’t that ‘soft drink’
expensive?”

“Not for me, I’m a football

“Oh, then you make good

Les said, “All the better, when
the strike’s settled."

“If you make good money, why
strike?” asked a confused—Socrates.

“Look, I have a lot of expenses.
And when Iretire in eight years, my

“I can see your point.After all,

around the expensive sauna.

“The best," replied I.cs proudly.

“'I‘hen your expenses are large?"
“You know it!" I.es answered

Letters/ Columns

Reporter Wrong

On Frat Complaint

Dear Editor:

This letter is in response to
Christina (Ilinton's column on
Sept. 20, 1982. It astouiids me that
such a column could be written by
a responsible member of The Pitt
News staff.

The fact that the two fraternities
were tight-lipped about the occur-
rence on Sept. 11 should not be sur-
prising. They were in a potentially
embarrassing situation and chose
not to talk about it. This is, of
course, well within their rights.
Miss Clinton seems to be forgetting
that the journalistic responsibility
of informing the public falls on her
and not on the fraternities or the
IFC. It is her responsibility to get
the story and if tight-lipped frater-

nity men scare her off, she mightas
well get out of journalism now.
Her paranoia of an IFC conspir-
acy strikes me as beingjust slightly
silly. The wish of the Greeks to
make as little of the event as possi-
ble is natural. No one in their right
mind would encourage the disper-
sal of information that reflects
poorly on their organization, yet
Miss Clinton sees some sort of
threat to journalistic freedom in
this action. How does she think the
IFC forced the fraternities involved
to keep their mouths shut? With
threats of doul)le-secret probation?
I hope that Miss Clinton thinks
over her comments and doesn’t
bless us wi-tli further editorials,
such as “The IFC link to the CIA.”

CMU Fans Act

Dear Editor:

I am writing this letter in order
to air my views on the behavior of a
large number of people present at
the CMU-Pitt Junior Varsity foot-
ball game played Sunday, Sept. 12,
I982, at Tartan Field. From the
outset, it was obvious that CMU's
team and coaches, in particular,
showed very little class in the
manner in which they conducted
themselves. In spite of the fact that
this was principally a practice
game and the officials called an
inordinate (and deserved) ntiniber
of penalties on both teams, these
“men" allowed themselves to
become livid.

At the halftime break, a CMU
coach could be heard from the
other side of the field, without

ainplification, to say, “if you guys

don’t get on the refs, then I will." I
feel that this isan uiisportsinarilike
attitude to impart to young men in

Party Debate Continues

Dear Editor:

I wish to respond to a letter in the
Sept. 20 issue of The Pitt News
concerning the defense of parties.
The comments made by this group
calling themselves the Pitt Yacht
Club are quite uncalled for. Except
for one or two points, their defense
consists of justifying parties under

'* freedom of doing as they wish, des-
pite the effect on innocent
bystanders.

The first point I wish to cover is
|their right to ask the definition of a
party. Basically, how do you judge
their definition of a social event?
These days, alcohol is the prime
enticement for these social events.
Also, what about the noise level at

most of the so-called “social
events”? Can you answer the ques-
tion of the hours of these events?
They typically happen late at night
and into the morning. If you don’t
call that description one way to
identify a party, I don't know what
else to call it.

Next, I admit an error in my let-
ter in reference to the phrase

“unauthorized parties” because I‘

forgot to include the two-word
phrase “involving alcohol” in it.

The claim that alcohol tends to
provide a relaxed atmosphere fails
to include a key fact that alcohol
impairs the senses. Add to that
detail that one drink—probably
even a beer——affec'ts a person for at
least an hour. Furthermore, the

more consumed per hour, the tipsi-
er he gets. If that is considered a
relaxed atmosphere, something is
wrong

Now to ,deal with the issue of
stereo nois’e"‘le'vel. You claim that if
you don’t have the brains or guts to

stop it by asking the other person to

turn it down, you deserve a sleep-
less night. Often to inform these
people, you have to act as noisy and
uncivilized as they do to get them to
listen or ever respond, so don’t tell
me I have no guts.

I feel sorry for those members of
the Pitt Yacht Club for not realiz-
ing the effects of their socializing.

Dear Editor:

We, as'Americans, are com-
mitting ’a grave error in our lack
of discerning the responsibility
and tragedy incurred through
the death, suffering and des-
truction happening now in
Lebanon. This is a sacrifice of
love in the innocence of people
who have nothing but it to live
for, the Lebanese poor.

The aims of Israel's _Zionist
rulers, who are imperialistic,
wealth-greedy and racist by
nature, and, while in conjunc-
tion with a rich, influential
“Christian” Lebanese author-_
ity with splinter right wing mil-
itia death squads, mask the
interests of people in the U.S.
whose power and decisions
result in the magnitude of
Israeli destruction in Lebanon.
These people form a complex
aggregate composed in part of
the Israeli lobby, the head fig-
ures of America's giant oil com-
panies, her major defense
contractors, Pentagon officials
and a general entrepreneur elite
who are instrumental behind
the Reagan administration.
These people know who they
are.

The American military con-

nection iii the Israeli invasion

On The Brink Of Catastrophe

has a dual purpose: to thwart a
government unfavorable to
U.S. capitalists from develop-
ing, spurred by Moslem impe-
tus in Lebanon, and to create a
strong, anti-Soviet strategic
location to further her impe-
rialist Middle East policy. How
do the United States’ designs on
Lebanon tie into the Iran-Iraq
war? Does Lebanon play a key
factor in U.S. Persian Gulf oil
interests?

In view of the strain on
Lebanon by the influx of Pales-
tinians, Israel aggravated the
delicate Lebanese peace and
incited civil war to which she
would be the victor. Besides the
indiscriminate bombing which
has resulted in horrible death
and injuryjto thousands of peo-
ple, Israel has launched a major
destruction policy far beyond
the 25 mile PLO free zone, des-
troying all forms of industry
and other foundations of the
economy, reducing particularly
the moslem sectors of Lebanon
to ruin. Israel will ultimately
force the establishment of busi-
ness favorable to Israeli profit.
The bombing of the Iraqi
power plant is indicative of
Israel's wish to keep all Arab
countries underdeveloped.

_ Israel, in the guise of religion,

Israeli troops bulldozed Arab
homes on Arab land to erect
townhouses for Jewish
immigrants.

U.S. and Israel have com-
bined in a concerted effort to
disseminate the Palestinian
people thereby removing one of
the principle factors that draws
Arab states toward unity. From
Jewish orchestration, Ameri-
cans have been the target of the
most effective propaganda
machine in the world. Mena-
chem Begin and his cohorts are
trying to see what limitation a
nation can gamble on its right
to exist without bringing the
world to the brink of catas-
trophe. To what limit will

go before she even consumes
herself in sacred cannibalism?
No peoples’ God would sanc-

At one point, a fight broke out on
the field among players and.the
resulting abuse of the officials was

embarrassing. ‘
The fans in the stands were no
better. Professional adults sat

screaming like inadiiieii about Pitt

physical shortcomings. These peo-

be disgusting. ,

monumental display of rude. cliil—

the Tartans. It was enlightening to
me that the personnel and fans of a
quality school and football pro-

as abusive and domineering as
combatants in some type of gang
war. I lost a great deal of respect for
the representatives of a fine

Dear Edi tor:

()ii stage, behind the front
wall in Room 121 of the David
Lawrence building is a piano.
The words “Donnie" and
“Pitt" have been scratched into
the (lark mahogany finish.
Burning cigarettes have left
scars on the keyboard. But it
was still playable. It was, until
someone decided to break the
wooden hammers during the
Winter term.

The hammers are a necessary
part in the function of a piano.
When someone presses a key
down, the hammer then strikes
the metal strings. This results
in a sound———pleasure to the ears
of a pianist. Often, pleasure for
others too. .

"Fortunately there is another
piano in Room 203, also in
David Lawrence. This one is a
“Baldwin.” The name is recog-
nized as a sign of quality to the
musician. '

Unfortunately the hammer
bandit also located this piano

early in the Spring term. This
time he was a little more consid-
erate. Six of‘ the 88 hammers
were left intact. At least min-
imal sounds can still be
produced. '

l, a pianist, appreciated these
pianos. They were the only two
on campus, that I know of, on
which I was legally alllowed to
practice. There are about eight A
pianos in the practice rooms at
the music building, but they are
reserved for music majors. Iain
a iioii-inusic major, therefore, I

tional $25 per term to use these
pianos.

I am notaccusing a student or
professor from Pitt of being the
hammer bandit. Outsiders have
easy access to Pitt’s facilities. It A
could have easily been one of
them.

I am asking that while you're
having fun or leaving out your
aggressions, you do it while

A Little Advice For
A Pitt Whi.stle- Blower

Dear Editor:

Things really can't be all that
bad in the School of Medicine.
After all, Robert Glew, the School’s
resident “whistle—blower” seems to
have been promoted to full profes-
sor, and it is a bit unusual to see
dissidents treated this way.

I write to take issue with Glew on
an important conceptual matter
which is crucial to understanding
and correcting problems in any
organization. Glew’s argument is
that until a very few years ago, the
School of Medicine was in the same

class as Johns Hopkins, Yale, Penn

and Columbia. Deterioration set in
rapidly, he concludes, when the
clinical faculty began forming the
corporations which now seem to be
rumiiiig wild. The result is that
“secret...practice plans have
brought out the primitive territor-
ial instincts of man.”

The heredity vs.’ environment
debate faces us every day. Do
humans act on the basis of genetic
endowment or in response to the
surrounding environment? Glew is
arguing that .what he‘ dislikes
(greed) is a matter of instinct, but
that what he likes (service) came
about only because greed was
strictly controlled. Why assume

that greed is “natural” and service I

to others is “unnatural?” The

reverse could just as easily be the"

case.

Glew’s argument would be

_ stronger, and easier for the clinical

faculty to digest, if it was based
upon “undesirable consequences”
of past decisions rather than upon
biological instincts. He is seeking
to change the environment so as to
bring about more
consequences.

Liddy Visit is Protested

Dear Editor;

Why are we (by virtue of the
activities fee) being forced to pay
off G. Gordon Liddy’s Watergate
fines? I find this extremely exasper-
atiiig in light of Liddy’s and
Leary’s past accomplishments.

Liddy and Leary have taken their
putative road show across the
country and have even found their
way otito the Phil Donahue Show,
where even soap box fans watched
a debate bereft of any meaningful
conclusions. In facing off once
again, are we to discover anything
new in their philosophies?

In light of Liddy’s past track
record, one which he finds aiinis-

ing, this debate should have never
been funded by the Pitt Program
Council. I am not of the opinion
that they should be barred from
open discussion of polarized politi-
cal ideologies, but for whom is this
debate financially beneficial?

I strongly protest this expendi-
ture of large sums of money that
will be collected by the justice
department for Liddy’s criminal
misdeeds.

Four thousand dollars for (S.
Gordon Liddy? This is truly an
injustice!

Rabbi Levine

Chaplains

Association  

Offers

Views On

Growing
Trend

Like oil and water, religion and
college students just don’t mix. Or
do they? Just how active is the
church in the daily affairs of the stu-
dent, and what importance does the
role of a religious affiliation‘ play in
today's student?

Sister Bernadette, Young, chair-

, person of the University Chap-

lain’s Association, explained that
the assocaition has come more and
more into recognition among the
students.

We have 23 chaplains right now,
and there are three or four more
-who want in. And of course, the
more campus ministers who get
involved means that there are more
students who will get involved.”

She mentioned that the Student
Council has been cooperative and
that the university has given more
support to the association. She
went on to say that young people

want to affiliate themselves reli- .

giously, and it is now regarded as
socially acceptable by others to join
a church.

“Students need each other,” she ,

went on to say, “and we’ve got to
meet that need. Ministers are
becoming aware of this, which is
why the different fellowships on
campus have been a help in provid-
ing a- place for the student to
worship.”

One move which brought this
about was the charismatic move-
ment that started at Duquesne Uni-
versity in the '60s.

“We are taking a different
approach to the gospel; it is no
longer seen as only a scholarly look

toward God, but also a practical

17

_Among various members of the
Chaplains Association, it is the prac-
tical approach many ministers are
noticing. ,

“There is a more pragmatic
stance in life, it’s more realistic,”
said John Wilson of the Episcopal-
ian campus group, Canterbury.
“Students are serious about school
due to the escalating cost of educa-
tion. The old ways of the late ’60s

Sister Bernadette

haven't changed society and people
are beginning to notice a spiritual
dimension to their lives. When you
have scientific investigation into life
after death, that’s stepping into a
theological realm.

“Students are concerned with
getting the grades and are realizing
they are going to need a job, but
there is still that sense of ‘there must
be something more.’ Students have
a personal understanding of a world-
view,” Wilson said.

Wilson went on to mention that,
generally, there is a searching——an

acceptance of religion, eastern_and

Religious

“l’ve had stimulating interaction
with the students,” he said. “I’ve
enjoyed it.”

It is in the worldview of the stu-
dent that Rabbi Levine of B’nai Brith
has seen changes take place.
“Things have shifted. A lot more
individuals are concerned with their
spiritual identities,” he said.

“Ten years ago, it was easy to
generate interest in general causes
such as feeding the hungry in the
Third World. Now you need a spe-
cific cause located in a specific area
to stimulate interest. That’s map-
ping out the personal identity. This
is also due to the economics of the
situation; much of my counseling is
in the financial concerns of students
where a decade back, religion was a
way of dealing with the Vietnam
War,” Levine said.

The Reverend Nathan Williams of
the First Baptist Churchrecognizes
that the church was organized in
holding an anti-war position. The
mainline denominations had groups
for draft counseling. The early 705
also saw the rise of many “para-
church” groups such as Campus
Crusade for Christ spreading
throughout college campuses.

C “It’s quieter now, more practical.
There are more students in worship
and, though this doesn’t mean the
church is any better, we are glad for
it,” he said.

A trend of the media in the recent
past, Williams explained, was to use
the term “born-again” in a broad
sense for what was happening reli-
giously. lt’s an experience that has
been around for years but he main-
tains that the term is often misused.

“Bob Guccione, the editor of
Penthouse, was reported by the
media to have had a ‘born~again’
experience, but something must
have gone wrong for him to con-
tinue what he’s doing,” he said.

Williams commented that it is well
for today’s student to have an
intense personal faith, but he must
also have a greater awareness for a
world vision. He added that real
"faith involves people in a
community.

It is this involvement in the com-
munity that Andrew Hunter, pastor
of Gateway Christian ,Fel_lo“wship,

lt’s easy for them to get wrapped
up in themselves. They need to find
a job and study. They also want to
see the fruit of their efforts in a par-
ticular cause which is why the stu-
dent of today is less likely to be
involved in something unless they
know the specifics.”

Hunter wenton to say that when
students come to campus, they will
often find another replacement for

_church, that they have only gone

because that’s the thing to do.

He acknowledges that some
freshmen come to campus finding
out that all of their questions are not
always answered by their traditional
understanding of the church. Oth-
ers, he maintains, come asking
questions and find those answers
through a relationship with Jesus
Christ. -

Reverend Sampsell of the Luther-
an University‘Center sees a swing
back toward religion on campus
even though if may not be the reli-

gion or church from the student’s
home.

‘I think’, there is a
swing on a social
pendulum towards

personal piety and

I conservatism. ’

“When I was a student in the early
’50s, there was more of/an institu-
tionalized commitment, and that IS
something that isn’t there today,” he
said.

Although the change toward
more organized religion is not as

rigid as in the ’50s, why is it nonethe— t

less taking place?

“Things in the late ’60s or early
'70s didn’t work. The 18-22 year olds
who are in college now were in grade
school then, and they caught from
their parents a type of disdain for the
wildness. Students look for the

A practicality today and are trying to

establish their own values,” Samp-
sell said.

This has been good for ministers,
he adds, since they can confidently
plan with a sense that something will
happen.

I “Plus there is an openness for
spirituality, though not necessarily
in a church sense,” he added.

The number of students at the
Lutheran Center have increased in
number, said Sampsell. They touch
on a serious level upwards of 350
students in a year’s time, with a core
group of 50 or 60.

“l think there is a swing on a social
pendulum toward personal piety
and conservatism. I suppose it will
swing back. It will be interesting to
see just where that swing goes,” he
said.

Yes, it will be interesting to see
where the pendulum swings. Reli-
gion and the college student—-a
passing fancy or a deep yearning?

Lacrosse Team Ready For Action

Crooked sticks, stones and miles
of field were the playing materials
of a sport originated by the Indians
in the 16005. This sport is still pop-
ular around college campuses in
the Atlantic coast states today.
Mike Connors is the president of a
club at Pitt that is trying to cash in
on the popularity of the sport
named after those crooked sticks --
lacrosse.

So far, 25 people have been work-
ing out with the club every Wed-
nesday and Friday afternoon,
preparing for the first match of the
year, this Sunday against the Mor-
gantown Lacrosse Club at Tree
Field at 2 p.m. ‘

Connors first got the idea of
forming a club this past March. He
had played lacrosse at various clubs

in upstate New York.

“In the beginning of March, I
started to call people around,”
Connors said,1‘,‘I got in contact
with local business to sponsor us.”

-According to Connors, one of the
earliest and most loyal sponsors of
the club has been the Sanctuary bar
and restarant in Oakland.

“I went to Nick Leventis, the
owner‘, and asked him for help dur-
ing the early summer,” Connors
said. “Nick has helped us in get-
ting our uniforms.”

As with other clubs that are not
yet recognized by the Student
Government Board, the lacrosse
club of Pitt has faced the financial
problems of starting off. Fortu-
nately, the support of the Sanctu-
ary and other business have helped
the club through their initial
problems.

The Lady Panther volleyball team won four consecu-
tive matches in the Pitt Preview Tournament this past

weekend.

Armour phOt‘O

“Recognition by SGB is still
pending,” ‘Connors said. “Mean-
while, along with the Sanctuary,
BobvOtto’s in Bellevue is giving
every member of the club a 30 per-
cent discount in sporting goods
while the Pittsburgh Lacrosse

Club will supply us with the goals p

and a local high school will help us
with equipment until we can
afford our own." .
Plans are being made as far as
scheduling clubs for this fall and
next spring. The club has plans to
play in the Ohio University Invita-
tional, and in the spring, it will be
participating in the Allegheny
Lacrosse League, along with
Allegheny College, Slippery Rock,
5 Washington and Jefferson, West
Virginia, Bethany, St. Vincent,
Frostburgh, Morgantown Lacrosse

Club and Wheeling Lacrosse Club.

Connors’ goal for the club is the
same as that of any fledgling — to
be competitive.

“Through the year, I want the
team to improve,” Connors said. “I
can’t wait to get on the field.”

As for the festivities outside the
playing field, lacrosse shares the
same tradition as rugby — treating
the opposing team at the nearest
bar. Connors said the Sanctuary
will be the place for Pitt’s post-
game celebrations.

Despite the growing pains asso-
ciated with starting off, the lacrosse
club of the University of Pitts-
burgh has at least one goal in mind
— to build support for the ancient
sport of lacrosse.

squad has a promising power on its
hands.

After hosting four schools over
the weekend, the Lady Panthers
hiked their match record to ll-l
and concurrently did the same to
their game card 26-6. The game
record takes into account the indi-
vidual games won.

The matches started out on Sat-

urday night with Rutgers the
opponent. In a liest-of-live series,
Rutgers bowed 8-1.3, ls’)-I, l:')-I0, 9-
I5, and l.3—l 1. Although Rutgers is

not rated in the nation's Top 20.
coach Shelton (Iollier looked upon
them in a higher manner. “Rutgers

is a very good team and is probably
rated in the East right below Penn
State and Pitt.”

The following day, Collier’s
team racked up eight straight wins
enroute to a 4-0 day and the Pre-
view’s championship. Indiana
University of Pennsylvania fell
first at l5-6, l5-12. Rutgers didn’t
go down without a fight; the Lady
Panthers rallied to score l6-l4 and
15-10 victories..Slippery Rock and
Kent State didn’t prove formidable
as both fell victim of prey 15-6, .15-8

and 15-3, 15-7, respectively.
Overall, Collier is content with
the ll-l start, considering it a con-

fidence builder.

“Sure, we still have our question
marks," he asserted, “but the main
thing going for us is mental tough-
ness. We still have a lot'of work to
do as well as itnproving our execu-
tion to bring the team together on
the volleyball court."

Defeat  
Tartans

By MARK A. SINDLER

Playing under near-monsoon
conditions amidst a very uncooper-
ative Mother Nature, the Panther
soccer team came through in vic-
torious fashion against the
Carnegie-Mellon Tartans, 3-1.

Pitt reached the scoreboard first
when Nick Wilson punched in at
the 10:50 mark of the first half. Fif-
teen minutes later, CMU evened
the score and closed out first half
scoring.

Midway through the second
half, Wilson put the Panthers
ahead to stay with an assist from
Eric Tiedtke. Sparky Lucke pro-
duced an insurance goal at 19:54
with an assist by Dan Zamaski to
conclude what coach Leo Bemis
termeda “team effort,”

According to Bemis, the Pan-
thers played amid very bad condi-

tions and needed better shooting to A

move the ball. No injuries were
sustained during the game.

“We did what we had to do,"
Bemis asserted.’ “Today’s match
took a certain amount of discipline
and the squad put forth a very
respectable team effort.”

The Panthers employ a play-
control game as contrasted to a
wide open offensive technique.
The method hasn’t really produced
any scoring leaders.

Bemis added, “I’m certainly
pleased with the team’s play, but
one element lacking is goal-
scoring. The ones we expect to
come through aren’t. Therefore,
we need so_me more shooting and
scoring.”

Wilson and Lucke currently
share the team’s scoring lead with
two goals apiece. The team’s record
now standsat 2-4, which may in
part be due to its composition of
younger players.

“Right now,” Bemis continuedf

“we’re quite a young team. We
usually start three freshmen and
sometimes even play with one or
two more at a time.”

The Panthers will be striving to
improve their record when they
oppose Gannon on Friday at l p.m.
at Pitt Stadium.

squad. He added, ‘‘Our little roster
means there are only a few players I
can rely upon from game to game.

We cannot afford to lose (to injury) '

even two or three good players.'The
numbers won’t permit it."

A significant case in point was
the weekend loss of spiker—
outside hitter Robin Kukalis. The
former Kiski standout was ham-
pered by a pulled stomach muscle.

“Robin is the No. 1 server for the
team," Collier said. “She is a
senior, adding experience and sta-
bility to the team. We really cannot
afford to lose too many players like
her." ‘

Kukalis is questionable for the
Penn State match.

With an impressive record to
bolster him, (Iollier heads into per-
haps the squad's toughest chal-
lenge to (late. l“riday’s opponent
brings to town l5th ranked Penn
State. This is when the full show
starts. There have already been
sneak previews.

Injustice

Viewpoint

 

By scorr DELLETT

It’s becoming obvious that des-

.. troying an inadequate team has

more value in the eyes of sportswri-
ters than defeating a good, solid
one. Then you know what they say
about some sportswriters 

Pitt is still No. 1 in the United
Press International poll, which
consists of college coaches around
the country. The Panthers dropped
to third in the Associated Press
poll, which have —— well you may
have guessed by now.

Pitt was in the top spot of the AP
poll just two short weeks ago. Gen-
erally, the pollsters keep a football
team in the number one position
as long as they win, but it hasn’t
happened.

Here-are the circumstances:

Pitt just barely managed to get
by North Carolina 7-6, on national
television Sept. 9. There would
have been reason to lose the rank-
ing if the Panthers beat Oregon
State or Northwestern 7-6, but the
Tar Heels were ranked in the top
five before the game. Two good
teams means a close game if it’s7-6
or 37-36, right?

There’s more to the plot.
Washington, the number two
team, annihilated Texas-El Paso
55-0. Notice it wasn’t Texas, Texas
Tech, Texas A&M or even Texas-
Arlington. but Texas-EL PASO.
The Miners have had a siesta since
the Spanish-Mexican War.

Washington used it to their
advantage. The Huskies became
the top team in the nation, the
Panthers dropped to second.

By BARRY ZASLOFF

The Pitt Panther football season
is still rather young——only two
games old:but already I have a
notebook flooded with thoughts.
So as to make some space for this
Saturday’s game against Illinois, I
will FREE myself of some of the
speculations:

O In defeating North Carolina

‘and Florida State in consecutive

weeks, Pitt proved itself worthy
challengers for the national cham-
pionship. Forget that the Panthers
only outscored the Tar Heels by a
mere point, and were tied at the
half by the Seminoles, before rac-
ing to a 37-17 victory. The fact
remains, Pitt beat two quality
opponents. '1

0 In moving the Panthers from
the top rated team in the nation to
No. 3, the Associated Press Poll-
comprised of sports writers——could
makea better case for insanity than
did John Hinckley.

O The opposite can be said of the
United Press In_ternational
ranl_<ings—made up of coaches-
who have kept Pitt in the No.1
spot. .

0 Illinois will be the toughest
test thus far for the Panthers. They
are undefeated and are averaging
over 30 points a game. The offense
is loaded and the defense is good
enough to hold the opposition
down. -

0 After the next two games
against Illinois and Wet
Virginia—both undefeated—the
schedule eases considerably with
home games against Temple and
Louisville and road contests with

Apparently the AP football polIster—comprised of sports writers from around the

country—share different sentiments than the worshippers of this sign.

football. The Cornhuskers were
ranked third in the nation. The
bookies were debating whether to
give the Aggies 50 points.

It may have been a good thing
the game was off the betting line.
The Cornhuskers ripped, torn,
kicked, mutilated, spat on, and
generally ran over New Mexico
State's defense en route to four
NCAA records and a 68-0 massacre.
Even Cornhusker head coach Tom
Osborne said that the Aggies were
not a real good football team.

Meanwhile Washington only
defeated Arizona 23-13. Notexactly
impressive figures. And Pitt beat
Florida State 37-17 in a rainstorm
after a 10-point spot to the Semi-
noles in the first quarter. Impres-
sive, especially considering the
Florida State crowd was ready to
taste some Panther meat.

Everyone was waiting to see the
results of the AP poll this week.
Could Pitt regain the top spot? No,
Washington still kept it despite

Armour photo

their less than impressive win, but
Nebraska takes the number two
spot and Pitt drops to third,
although the Panthers won by 20
points.

So what does all this mean? Well,

if Alabama defeats Vanderbilt by 30
points 01‘ more and Pitt has another
close game against Illinois, expect
the Panthers to drop to number
four in the AP poll.

It just goes to showihow the
wonderful sportswriters are quali-

Syracuse and army. Taking a look
at the negative side, Notre Dame
and Penn State are waiting in line.

0 All of the above considered, an
undefeated season must still be
considered a difficult task.

0 In the North Carolina game,
with about a minute remaining,
Pitt coach Foge Fazio used Dan
Marino as the punter, a scene that
Panther fans have grown accus-
tomed to when Pitt punts from the
opposition’s side ofgthe field.

The strategy is curious. Why risk
an injury to Marino, a potential
Heisman trophy winner and the
person Pitt can least afford to lose.
Thoughts drift back to last season
when a vicious Penn State rush
resulted in Panther punter Dave
Hepler leaving the game with a leg
injury. After off—season surgery and
rehabilitation, Hepler is still not
performing at top efficiency.

0 Sitting in the press box and
covering a football game is excit-
ing, until the time comes to write a
deadline story.

0 The biggest surprises of the
season has been the play of fullback
Marlon McIntyre and punter Greg
Ganzer. McIntyre has switched
from halfback to fullback and has
done an admirable job, both run-
ning and blocking. Ganzer has
consistently punted the ball
between 40 and 50 yards.

A '0 How could a man with a name
like Serafino Fazio become a head
football coach?

0 Losing Jackie Sherrill was not
such a great loss. Though his pay-
check may not indicate so, Fazio is
as good of a coach as Sherrill is, and
he may become a fixture at Pitt.

  Sports Writers Missing The Boat By Ranking PittThird

fied to decide who should be
national champions. It’s been
known for years that certain writers
vote for teams in their geographic
areas. And they now look at huge
margins against inferior competi-
tion to base their judgments.

And Pitt will be the team that
gets the shaft. Hopefully when the
Panthers play their pasties, the
scores will be the same as what
Washington and Nebraska did to
their opposition.

Some things I sometimes think
about when I have time to think -
considering I'm always at this
typewriter.

0 If Pitt gets by Illinois and West
Virginia, the national champion-
ship may not be theirs, but at least
the Panthers will receive a major
bowl bid.

0 All bowl bids should be open
— people are sick of seeing the
“Granddaddy of them all,” the
Rose Bowl, played with less than
classy teams. '

O The new cross-country and
track coach John Vasvary will
bring Pitt hack into national
prominence —- where it belongs.

0 Even though the Pirates won't
make the playoffs, it was a very suc-
cessful year for the Bucs, who many
thought would be fighting the
Cubs for the cellar.’

0 Watch out for the Cubs. Chi—-
cago has been 46-44 since June 1
and 27-18 since August. General
Manager Dallas Green has done an
outstanding job, considering the
setbacks he has.

0 The Crow 1 had to eat after Dale
Berra proved me wrong was very
tasty.

O The last team who wants to
strike in the NFL is the Steelers. It's
almost like 1974 again.

The Lady Panther Tennis team
traveled to CMU Monday for their
season opener and shut out the
Tartans, 9-0.

Head coach George Dieffenbach
was very pleased with his team’s
showing, saying, “Everyone per-
formed well, andeveryone played
aggressively. We had good team
spirit."

The Tartans, defending Presi-
dent's Athletic Conference cham-
pions for the Iastthree years, were
outclassed by the Pitt squad, inan-
aging only one single set win the
whole night.

Dieffenbach attributed the shut-
out to the players’ good condition-
ing and flexibility.

“Being I-10 last year, it was good
to be able to win the opener, but all
of the players have weaknesses, and
we have a lot of things to work on,”
he said.

Caught ' in the cookie
jar....

The NCAA announced that the
University of Georgia football

team was to be_put on one year
probation for recruiting violations

last year. The probation doesn’t

mean that the Bulldogs will not
appear on national television and
bowl games, but they will lose
three scholarships for the 1983-84
season.

Did they graduate...?

.According to university records,
31 percent of former Michigan
football players in the, National
Football League did not graduate,
according to a story in the Michi-
gan Daily, the school’s newspaper.

The paper said that eight of 26
players have not picked up degrees,
which is lower than the estimate of
a report in the Aug. 23 issue of

Sports Briefs

Sportflllustrated, which said 40
percent didn't earn their degrees,
but it’s higher than head coach Bo
Schembechler's figure of 15 to 20
percent.

Sooners to go for big
bucks...

They don’t call them “Sooners”

for nothing.

openbids for broadcasting rights
to this Saturday’s game between
Oklahoma and Southern Califor-
nia at Norman.

This is the first offer since a rul-

INSIDE STORY?

_ When Judy Lat-
terty prepares for a
like

race the annual
cross—|owa run, she
makes sureher bike is
in perfect shape.

She inspects and
adjusts every part. She
tunes and balances
the whole machine, so
it can go the distance.

Because she
treats her body the
so me way, she disc0v—
ered a lump in her
breast a few years
ago. -

She discovered it
early. And these days,
85% of early breast
cancers can be treated
successfully.

Judy has since
had reconstructive
sur er , too. And she
fee 5 li e herself
again. Alive, vibrant,
ready to get on her
bike and take on the
world.

Judy Lafterty is
iust one example of
the kind of progress
we're making against
cancer in its many
forms.

The American
Cancer 8 'ety takes
some cre ‘t for that
progress. Butcredit
won't finance our
work.

We need , ur
money to help 5 win
this race.

and’ save you 21 bunch of time. So

Some date you are! I spend the
whole night watching you study
while everyone else is out having
fun. If you had used Cliffs Notes
instead, you would have more time
for me. They help you understand
what you read and they give a great
review. Get Cliffs Notes at the

calling me tonight. I'll be at the
