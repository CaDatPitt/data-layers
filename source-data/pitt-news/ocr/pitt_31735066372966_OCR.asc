Faculty Assembly. Meets  

By JUDY GREER

‘At yesterday’s Faculty Assembly
meeting, the assessment of faculty
and -staff performance, student life
concerns and the university’s
financial standing were reported as
being discussed during the admi-
nistrative planning meeting in
Johnstown according to Richard
Tobias of the English Department.

Tobias said there seemed to be a
general concern for student life.

“When I think what the student
has to live through to live on this
campus, it worries me,” Tobias
said. ‘ V

"‘*He said Pitt needs something to /-

attract more academically oriented
students.‘
According to Tobias, Pitt stu-
‘.

dents ask one question, “Will this
help me get a job?” If it doesn't
directly relate to that, they pay no

‘ attention to it.

This year only 25 Pitt students

are studying abroad, Tobias said,\

while 300 Penn State students stu-
died abroad this year, even though
the university administration is
“quite supportive of the University
Center of International Studies.”

Student life was only one of ‘

many topics addressed at the John-
stown meeting. According to
Tobias, five topics were addressed:
faculty work conditions, changing
student constituencies, external
relations, research and interna-
tional dimensions.

Tobias said, however, that “the
whole thing was a conference on

reducing costs from beginning to
end.” Everything began with the
phrase, ‘in times of declining
resources...’ V r

“Of course, that's what we ask
academic administrators to do——
manage the money for us,” Tobias
said. " ~

Tobias said that there were.
apprordmately 150 chancellors,
deans, assistantdeans, associate
deans and chairpersons‘, as well as
15 faculty and one university
historian.

“We broke into groups to discuss
ideas to improve services and
reduce costs,” Tobias said.

“We were told to consider _that
the bottom is half full, and not to
consider that it is half empty,” he
said.

 

 

 

‘According to Tobias, the group
was told by the chancellor that “we
(Pitt) are in sound financialcondi-.\_g
tion; we were told state support is
better than it has been-—
enrollment levels are holding at the

optimum level of the $50 billion
Council campaign—-our research

budget is up."

Tobias added to the chancellor’s
comments that "there is no reason
for euphoria, and there may be
some reason for civility with our-
selves and certainly no reason for
fear or terror.”

“We’re in sound fisarl position,
are we also in sound edumtional
position?", Tobias asked.

Tobias said they were also told
that\Pitt’s holding its maintenance
level on the campus. ‘

There was concern for the neces-

sity of faculty giving yearly con-
tracts to administrative offices so_
administrators can see what faculty
are doing and intend to do, accord-
ing to Tobias. ” i _ .

Women Must Rededicate Themselves
T 0 Politics, Weddington Says A i

By PEGGY FERRI

It is time women rededicate
themselves to politics, said Sarah
Weddington, former White House
to President Jimmy
Carter.‘

-Weddington was the keynote
speaker at the June 5 Women’s Pol-
itical Caucus of Allegheny County
(WPCAC) Convention held at the
William Penn Hotel.

Weddington, a native of West

‘ Texas,~is committed to civil rights

and improving the quality of life
for women- As a three-term Texas
legislator, she ws a key sponsor of
legislation leading to rape reform
laws.

In addition to her career in polit-
{C5, she jg Eggownifor arguing the
landmark case, Roe 2);. Wide-
before the Supreme Court—-a case
involving a waitress with an eighth
grade education seeking an
abortion. _

WPCAC, affiliated with
National Women’s Political Cau-

. cus, was founded in 1971 lo involve
women in thepolitical process and

actively__ support women
candidates. , ~

According to Weddington, her-
self a member, the WPC is the prin-
ciple reason she originally ran for
office. _ ’

“What we have seen in the last
ten years is that women can be very
effective when they serve an elected
office,” Weddington ‘said. “We
need more women serving in
elected office.”

Weddington commented on the

mood in Washington today and

‘ noted that for the last four years,

there have been at least two women
in the White House Cabinet.

When asked what she would like
to tell President Reagan if given a
chance, Weddington replied she
would not have much influence
with him. '

’';;;;,,'’ 5}]: said, ‘"1 would like to
see the 50 leading women fundrais-
ers, who are Republicans, tell him
that if he doesn't appoint more
women, they are not going to help
him get re-elected."

She also said Reagan has to

change his attitude about women

and recognize them for what they
are. i I
“When Reagan talks about a

i ‘return to the tradtional’—part of it

is that he lives in a world of people
who are of an income level that
most of us are not, who live in a
world that most don’t live in,” she
explained. “He simply doesn’t
have any awareness of what
women’s lives are -really like
today." *

With the ERA deadline fast
approaching, ‘Weddington admit-
ted that chances for passage are
minimal, but added it is an issue
that will continue to be examined.

“There are three members of
Congress," she explained, “who

By MATT HAWKINS ~

In November 1981, three
employees of the McDonnell-
Douglass Corporation in St. Louis,
Mn. were fired.

Harris Freeman was one, and he
was in Pittsburgh on Sunday, June
6, to talk about it. Freeman and five
other speakers addressed an
audience of approximately 100 in
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial.
The event was a benefit for the P01-
itical Rights Defense Fund
(PRDF)—established to “stop the
firing and harassment of union
activists,” according to a document
released by the organization.

Freeman worked in the machine
shop at McDonnell-Douglass
where he inspected machine parts.
The job was not one which is usu-
ally considered a high-clearance
job requiring extensive investiga-
tion into an employee's back-
ground and private life, according
to Freeman. He was investigated
however, and the investigation was
coordinated by the Defense Inves-
tigative Service, he said.

In'ia document released by the
agency, Freeman and others who
had been fired were described in
detail along with descriptions of
their political and union activities.
The document noted that the three
fired employees belonged to the
International Association of Mach-
inists union, the Socialist Workers
Party and the Young Socialist
Alliance.

The firing of Freeman and two
others was preceded by the firing of
14 people in Atlanta, Ga. by the
Lockheed Corporation. These 14
had. expressed anti-war views and
were known to be politically active,
according to Freeman.

PRDF calls it a violation of the
First Amendment rights of
employees, Freeman said.

The speakers gave examples of
on-the-job harassment and surveil--
-lance to discourage union and pol-
itical activity. These attempts
weaken the ability of labor to
demand better working conditions
and of individuals to support-wha-

tever political causes they want, the

speakers said.

Other speakers included Mon-
signor Charles 0. Rice; Tony
Buba, a film director; Carol McAl-
lister, from the Central American
Mobilization Coalition; Molly-
Rush,» an anti-nuclear activist and
j_ Mazur, a lawyer.

ony Buba explained the ele-
ment of fear working people face
when they are on the job. Workers

are hesitant about revealing cor-

rupt or dishonest company acts
because the reaction of manage-
ment is likely to be severe, he said.
The fear of being fired also _pre-
vents workers from complaining
about unsafe or unfair job condi-

V tions, according to Buba.

“If you're raised in Braddock,
Rankin or Homestead,” Buba said,
,‘,‘you’re raised not to ask questions

The Pitt .-News, :W‘e‘dtte"s'd'ay, t5tmt- 9,1982’

because you might not get a job.”

He added that one learns “you
just don’t speak out about certain
things. There are things that you
just don’t talk about.”

Buba recalled an incident from
his youth in a working-class neigh-
borhood when he repeated at
school statements his uncle had
made at home. He told the class
local politicians were dishonest
and revealed that his uncle had to
give the politicians kickbacks in
order to get work from them. Later
that evening, his mother received a
telephone call from the school
demanding an apology for the

child’s comments. Buba said that"

he could still remember walking
through the street the following
day, too ashamed to go to school
and disturbed by the fact that his
indiscretion had upset his parents
somuch. This, he said, was his first
lesson in the limitations of freedom
of speech.

Monsignor Rice said employees

who think and question and hold.

unconventional views will always
be the targets of employers and a
government that» seeks to force
them into conformity.

“Employers and most union
leaders like a docile work_ force-
...they.d’on’t like people who ask
questions,” Rice said. “They prefer
people who are quiet...those who

‘will swallow the conventional

rhetoric.”

A Monsignor Rice added that
when the economic situation gets
worse, the employers and the
government “look for scapegoats.
Those who have unorthodox ideas
provide natural scapegoa-ts,” he
said.

Freeman said McDonnell-

\ Douglass hired company spies as a

means of intimidation, and that
these spies prevented the
employees from being active in the
union. An employee could keep his
job “as long as you keep your
mouth shut and you don't get
involved in doing anything that
questions company or government
policy,” Freeman said.

“What they’re saying is that
‘when you punch a time clock at
this corporation, you give up your
Bill of Rights’...it seems to them
that exercising First Amendment
rights is a subversive activity,”
Freeman said.

McDonnell-Douglass’ action of
firing the three employees wasan
attempt to “chill union democracy
and to interfere in the unions and
try to prescribe certain political
viewpoints so that the members of
(the) union did not have a chance
to discuss and participate in politi-
cal organizations of their choice,”
Freeman said.

Freeman sees the firings as being
a part of a much larger movement
within the government towards
suppression of information.

Workers Unite ForRights

“The company and the govern-
ment want to limit what you
think,” Freeman said. “They want
to limit what you read and they

want to limit what you have a right -

to know."

He quoted Secretary of State
Alexander Haig as saying, “‘With-
out censorship, things can get terri-
bly confused in the public mind.”’

Freeman cited as an example of
this censorship the fact that over
300 Japanese citizens have been
denied visas to enter the United
States and participate in the June
12 march for -disarmament at the
United Nations in New York.
Many of them are survivors or rela-
tives of victims of the nuclear
attack on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. '

The Reagan administration has
added more restrictions on the
availability of government infor-
mation, Freeman added. The State
Department apparently believed
their participation would be too
subversive to be permissible,
according to Freeman.

Freeman gave examples of how
McDonnell-Douglass deliberately
tries to create an atmosphere of fear
and suspicion among employees.

He quoted a company poster
which warned employees to be on
the lookout for Russian spies.

The poster cautioned employees
that “‘you never know who a Rus-
sian spy is going to be. It may be a
co-worker, it may be a neighbor, it
may even be a member of the local
PTA.’

“Anyone the company does’ not

like can be fingered by the com-

pany spy as a security risk,” Free-
man said.

This presents a threat to job
security, he said.

Freeman says he has not given
up and refuses to be intimidated
into political apathy or
indifference.

“What we need to do is bring
everyone together who is affected
by Reaganism and this drive for
war and explain that we all have
the same stakes in fighting for our
democratic rights along with our
fight against budget cuts, war and
union busting," Freeman said.
“We must include-a fight for the
democratic rights of all
Americans."

‘ Carol McAllister said those who
strive for social progress all over
the world can’t afford to allow dif-
ferences of race, ideology or
national residency to stand in the
way of unity.

“We can't allow ourselves to be
srlenced...we must work and resist
gtogethermbecause _these difficult

aspects of political work are part of ‘

the same struggle," she said. “The
only way’ to defend our own and
other’s political rights is to act
politically." '

Activists from around the coun-
try have been gearing up for a
major demonstration‘ for nuclear
disarmament in New York City on
June 12.
On June 5, Pittsburgh added its
voice to the movement.
A crowd of over 200 attended a
noon.rally in the rain to call for
disarmament and hear . featured

, speaker Dr. Michio Kaku, City Col-

‘ lege of New York professor of
nuclear physics. I I

“Reagan says that he cannot go
for a freeze,” Kaku explained,
“because freezing the arms race
now would be like freezing a foot-
ball game at 300-0. Comparing" a

A nuclear war to "a football game is
'obs_cene."

Kaku said that he prefers the
analogy of two pyromaniacs nose
deep in high-octane fuel.

“We have so many warheads,”
he said, “that we actually lose track
of them and drop them. The butter-
fingers in the .Air Force have
dropped 27 atomic bombs.”

Kaku recalled that on Jan. 17,
1966, a B-52 collided with a KC-I35
refueling tanker separating four

. hydrogen bombs from the B-52,

According the UPI releases, _the
B-52 was carrying four 20 megaton
bombs, all of which were unarmed
and, therefore, did not explode.
One bomb landed in a dry river
bed, two split open and caused con-
tamination and the fourth was lost
over Palomares, Spain and was not
recovered until April 7, M1966.

his family died in Hiroshima. He
related details of the destruction
and, reminded the crowd not to
forget the lessons of Hiroshima.
Q In a later interview, Kaku spoke
about the student's role in the past
and its importance now.
“Students played a large role in
the anti-war movement of the
’60s,’’ Kaku said. “Nixonfs ‘secret
plan’ to end the war, according to
Daniel Ellsberg, was to drop an
atomic bomb on Hanoi. All prepa-
rations were made and at the last

minute, Nixon decided not to goh,
‘ ahead—the reason was that there -I
were 200,000 students camping out »

on his front lawn.

“According to Ellsberg,” Kaku i

added, “the peace movement never
realized what it was responsible for
preventing.” — ‘
Over 500,000 people are expected
to attend the demonstration in
New York City--including Major
Koch. Local activist and director of
the Thomas Merton Center, Molly
Rush was on hand at the rally and
urged the crowd to go to New York.
“There are‘ people walking
across the country to get there,“
Rush said. “There are people com-
ing from ‘Europe and _]apan——300
Japanese have been kept out by
government," she said, referring to,
the 300 denied visas by the State
Department. ’ ‘

“People say that talk about-

nuclear weapons is depressingf?
she said. “What’s depressing is
people who refuse to talk about”
them or think about them and just
let them go on."

“Women are going to have to
put a lot of effort forth in the next
five years to stay even, much less

stay ahead,” she explained. “Andi

part of that is through po1itics.”

She emphasized that more of the
important political decisions will
be made at the state and local levels
as Reagan's vision of New Federal-
ism is implemented.

According to Weddington, the
major obstacle standing in the way
of female candidates is money.

“I learned that anyone who has

fﬁie time and the interest can have

an impact,” Weddington said. “I
see more women who would make
excellent candidates who don’t
have the money——and this is where
there needs to be special effort.”

A According to WPCAC Treasurer
Elaine Herald, effort has begun on
a Political Action Committee
(PAC) for women associated'with
the local caucus. A state PAC, not
affiliated with any group, also
exists to‘ help women running for
state office. ‘ ,

Herald said she would like to see
women have a say where political
contributions are concerned.
 “Women have to start demand-
_' that half of what their families
contribute in political contribu-
tions: goes where they decide and
that they write the checks,” Herald
noted.

State is larger is that they have a
much lagger student body than
does Pitt; they have a much larger
school, McManus added. _

“The size of Temple and Pitttin

rollment is fairly comparable,”
McManus explained, “but the his-
tory (of appropriations) has been

When one gets cut back 1 percent,

Despite the present condition of
the economy, figures show this is

“It is certainly a recognition on

the part of state government, the

Weddington admitted, however.
the economy will be a determining
factor. .

Weddington added she disagrees
with the book -“Wealth and Pov-
erty,” which claims that if women
went back home where they
belong, the United States would

not have ‘its present economic
problems.

“When Reagan was in Barbados,
he said ‘now ldon’t mean to blame
it on the ladies, but unemployment
went up when women went into

‘the work force.’ I see a lot wrong

with that analysis,” Weddington
said. _

“The unemployed areas,” she
said, “steel and auto, are not areas
where there are high numbers of
women employed.” J

Weddington added it is often
ignored that working women. are
the reason some families are finan-
cially stable.

Student I‘-tepresentngPitt‘

By JEFF RUSSELL

Chuck PascaI,i]r., a University

of Pittsburgh sophomore majoring

in political science, was recently
elected to the Allegheny County
Democratic Committee.

Pascal will be representing Pitts-
burgh’s 4th ward, 6th district. .This
area incltides all of the Pitt dorms,
except Forbes Hall and also the
Schenley Farms area.

Since the district's constituency
is “about 90 percent students,” Pas-
cal said he intends to work toward
students’ goals and with their
interests in mind.

Pascal also stated that he would
like “to educate the students as to
what’s going on, and to help them
vote intelligently.”

Among the student-related
issues on which Pascal is already

working is the increase in bus fares “

proposed by the Port Authority of
Allegheny County, This increase
could have a negative impact on a
large number of Pitt's commuters,
and Pascal says he is concerned.
i“U-tickets will go up from 60
cents to a costof 85 cents, which is a
40-45 percent increase,” Pascal
said.
He believes this increase is unfair
because other reduced-fare rates are
not being increased.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, June 9, 1932

.

Pascal said he will attend a pub-
lic hearing on the matter, where he
will “argue for the same percentage
of the base price, which would
make the price of a U-ticket 80
cents.”

Another major issue with which
Pascal intends to deal is the finan-
cial aid cuts to students.

“If aid is cut, a lot of students
aren't going to be here. I won’t sup-
port anyone who voted anti-
student or who speaks out for cuts
in student aid," Pascal said.

Pascal also said he believes “Pitt
has shown total disregard for com-
muters” by proposing projects that
would eliminate parking spaces in
Oakland.

Regarding the Schenley Farms
area, Pascal said he doesn’t believe
a hotel is necessary in the area.

“I believe that a hotel would
definitely change the complexion
of the neighborhood," Pascal said.

According to Pascal, other major
responsibilities committee
members hve, in addition to voic-
ing constituents’ opinions, are to
“endorse candidates and to help get
out the vote.” “"

While on the committee, Pascal

' plans to be an available representa-

tive for the students of Pitt. He
intends to be a voice for the stu-
dents and also a sounding board for

I.

their problems. By acting as voice
and sounding board, Pascal said he
would be a “go-between" for the
people of the district and the legis-
lators in Harrisburg.

Pascal has been an active student
at Pitt. He is president of the Col-
lege Young Democrats, vice presi-
dent of Americans for Democratic
Action, and is the lobbying coordi-
nator for the Governmental Rela-
tions Committee of the Student
Government Board.

Even with all of these responsi-
bilities, in addition to school work,
Pascal is confident that he 
have enough time for his newly
secured position. V

“CYD, ADA and GRC all com-
plement each other, and thisjob
will fit right in,” Pascal said.

1t’s a political position, as are the
others, and Pascal believes the new
job won’t be extremely time
consuming. He has already been
involved with the county Demo-
cratic Committee, so “it’s no big
change," he said.

Pascal, ‘elected to a two-year 8
term, said he ran because “I’m
interested in and have been
involved in politics for a long time,
and I see an opportunity to help tm
students and residents of the“
district.”

RugbyTeam Gets Kicked

By NATALIE FRIEDMAN

Two Pitt undergraduates who
are members of the Oakland Rugby
Club have withdrawn from school
as a result of an incident that
occurred during a rugby match
with Juniata College in Hunting-
don, Pa.

The incident, according to a
news release, concerned the theft of
anatomic materials from a,labora-

tory in the university. When ques-

tioned about the theft, Dr. Conney
Kimbo, vice-chancellor of student
affairs, provided no comment.

The two students, whose names
cannot be released because of fed-
eral privacy laws protecting the
rights of students, effected their
permanent withdrawals prior to
the matter being adjudicated by the
campus Judicial Board.

The Oakland Rugby Club has
no affiliation with the university
and is comprised of Pitt students
and those outside the university

Falklands Crisis: Important For u.s.'.>i

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

Nobody was quite sure what to
make of the incident in March. A
small group of Argentine scrap mer-
chants looking for metal landed on

y — island of South Georgia (under

reat Britain's jurisdiction), planted
the Argentine ﬂag and sang their
national anthem. —
A month later, when the Argentine
junta launched,"Operation Sover-
eignty" and the British govemment
announced that a naval ﬂeet would
, be arriving at the Falkland Islands in
a. few weeks, it appeared that force
might be used to settle the dispute
between Great Britain and Argentina.
Secretary of State Haig was busily
ﬂying from one country to another,
attempting resolution by negotiation,
but it became evident that his efforts
weren't succeeding.
Now that the Falklands crisis has

/‘merged into a small-scale war over

the sovereignty of a_ group of islands
inhabited by 1,800 people and
700,000 sheep (though some might‘
argue Argentian's junta initiated con-
ﬂict to divert public attention from
their ailing political situation), what, if
any, ramiﬁcations does this have for
the United States?

Professor Joseph Eaton of public I

and international affairs believes that
US. involvement is inevitable.

The United’ States as a world
power is really always in a situation
where any conﬂict creates a problem
for us that is not easily solved,” Eaton
said. “Whenever a country‘
aggresses, uses force and violates
the charter of the United Nations, we
are on the spot if we do not use all the

—»§power at our disposal to oppose

'such aggression. At the same time,
since it is a South~American country
that was the aggressor, Argentina
and many of its friends feel that while
aggression is generally bad, it's justi-

V tied in this case.

"We cannot expect to have every-

body love us no matter what we do.

We have to take a stand, and depend-

' ing on which stand we take, ,thisTias

consequences (for the United
States)."

Eaton believes the future of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) resides in the U.S. decision
of which side to take in the conﬂict.

"If NATO fails to support a
member, it loses its credibility as a

. , ' ble alliance," he said. "The United _

States almost killed NATO in 1956
when we failed to support Britain and
, France in opposition to the nationali-
zation of the Suez Canal. NATO has
_ never fully recovered. If we had failed
to support Britain (this time), the con-
sequences probably would have
been the same." _
Although he says there will be
problems for the United States,
Eaton believes the. United States‘
choice to support Great Britian won't
bring as severe negative consequen-
ces as the public is now being led to
believe.-
“The Argentinians are trying to
.:rnake us feel that this is going to have

I  iterrible consequences," he said.

_ He believes that countries act out
of their own self-interest, and cites, as
an example, the fact that the Arab
states still prefer to deal with the U.S.
even though the US. has been very
su portive of Israel.

' They will act towards us in terms
of their own self-interest, and they will
understand that the United States
acts in terms of our self-interest,”

 

_ Eaton said. “And we don't abandon

Great Britain in a situation where an
island they have ruled is suddenly
invaded and occupied." _ _

Eaton thinks that the possibility of
the dispute turning into a war
between the superpowers is very
unlikely, the chance that the Soviet
Union will join forces with Argentina

, is slim.

.“At this point, that's what news-
paper people like to write about when
there is no news from the war zoneto
ﬁll the headlines. The war is just too
far from the Russian border to get
involved, especially since the ﬁghting
militarily seems to be near an end.

A People don't back losers too often."

Eaton believes Argentina's actions

, in trying to gain sovereignty over the

Falklands may set a precedent for
countries taking measures to attain
sovereignty in other parts of the
world;

In his opinion, the “lesson” of the .

Falklands crisis is to develop a ﬁrmer
policy from the beginning in similar
situations.

"It is doubtful that the Argentines

would have attacked if they really I

believed that the British wouldﬁght
and NATO would back them," he
said. "Britain and thetlnited States
did not use their deterrence power to
prevent the attack," and because of
this the British had to fight. It is much
better to use an army to deter rather
than to defend. This is why on some
issues a foreign policy has to be
clear, not fuzzy.”

Dr. Reid Andrews, an assistant pro-
fessor of history who lived in Argen-
tina for two years, believes the United
States‘ siding with Great Britain in the
Falklands dispute will hurt the amia-
ble relationship the United States
began to build with Argentina when
President Reagan came into ofﬁce.

Because of Argentina's poor per-
formance in the area of human
rights, relationships between the
junta and the Carter administration
were "very hostile," Andrews said.

The Reagan administration was

determined to change this relation-‘

ship, according to Andrews. in partic-

I

ular, they were very interested in
creating a new South Atlantic anti-
communist alliance to keep the area
free of Soviet influence. Andrews
said the three major anti-communist
forces would be the United States,
Brazil and Argentina. _

"The United States was dependent
on the Argentines to hold their end of
the alliance," he said. “This is why the
Reagan administration-did not want
to take sides when the war broke out
a few weeks ago. The Argentines
were counting on the United States
to do this. They did not think the U.S.
would come down very hard on
them. They were right in the short
mn.

"In the long mn, there really
couldn't be much question with what
side the U.S. was going to take. When
it came, the Argentine government
was greatly shocked and offended.

‘ "In future U.S. relations with
Argentina, (it) is very doubtful that
they will have the same form they
had during the ﬁrst year of the Rea-
gan administration.” '

Argentina at that time would have a
nuclear capability. A war that is now
restricted to conventional weapons
would at that time turn into a nuclear
holocaust." ‘

" "We don't really know what the
ramiﬁcations are yet," Blaiser said.
“We know now, though, that United
States support for Great Britain in the
crisis has complicated her relations
with rnany Latin Arnerlcan countries
who support Argentina. Some of
these countries feel that the United
States, being an American country,
should support Argentina-one of
the Americas ﬁghting against a Euro
pean superpower.

"If the conﬂict is settled soon
through negotiations between the
two major contestants, perhaps the
damage done to U.S.-Latin Ameri-
can relations will not be so great. It

could have a very corrosive affect on '

our relationship in the hemisphere,
but more important, between West-
ern Europe and Latin America."

Andrews also believes the United . 4

States waited too long to develop a

ﬁrm policy to resolve the Falklands

dispute.

“I would like to think that it would
alert the United States to the dangers
of allowing seemingly insigniﬁcant
international disputes to go on with-
out resolution. I don't think that it's
going to have that affect because the
United States foreign policy in recent
years -has tended to follow much
more on ‘crisis management‘ rather
than crisis resolution, which is to say
that you don't really try to get at the
root of the problem. Rather, you try to
keep the manifestations of the prob-
lem under control. But the problem
is still there."

Dr. Andrews hopes the war in the I

Falkland Islands will make the world
realize the dangers of nuclear prolif-
eration and aware of the threat of
nuclear catastrophe.

f‘The world has had a very narrow
escape," he said, “because if this war
were to have taken place in 1985,

Blaiser, who has recently retumedi

from Great Britain, believes the Falk-

lands crisis does not set an example -.

for countries to "throw their weight
around" in order to claim
sovereignty. 

"The problem is not one of claim-
ing sovereignty," he said. “It arose
from the problem of Argentina's mil-
itary take-over of the Falkland
Islands. The fact that Great Britain
sent its task force there suggests that
this will not set a precedent for take-
overs such’ as this.”

He said that we cannot yet know .

whether the dispute between the two

lesser powers will turn into one -

between the United States and the
Soviet Union.

"I think the impact on that is still 9,

limited. (The Falkland Islands are) a
long way from the Soviet Union,"
Blaiser said. V"On the other hand, (the
Soviets) are prepared to make the

most of opportunities that are pres-

ented to them."

A On
The
  Front  

Code-named Operation Peace, Prime Minister
Menachem Begin ordered the Israeli Army to drive
Palestinian forces northward to a distance of 25
miles from the Israeli border, thus insuring Palesti-
nian artillery are beyond the range of Israeli
territory. ‘ --

In doing so, Mr. Begin is aware of the risks. Israel,
regretably, is not only striking PLO forces but is also
dealing death and injury to many Lebanese and
Palestinian civialians who find themselves on the
road to war. If the past indicates anything and Israel
is successful in its drive, PLO‘guns will be back in
action-—only this time shelling Israeli settlements. 25
miles further away. ‘L I ‘

The UN Security Council may call for a complete

-cessation of violence; the United States may show

short term annoyance and Israel’s friends may
wonder about Begin’s announced “cleaning out” of
Palestinian forces. But will this be considered fore-
most by ‘Israeli ‘policy-makers?

The Israeli Ambassador to the , United States,
Moshe Arens, said-the attack had “a clear cut mis-
sion: pushing the PLO out of artillery range of
northern Israel.’.’ “ ‘

Israel seized an opportunity to correct a dangerous
military imbalance on their northern border. Vio-
lencefthough, is not the answer. To protect northern
Israeli from PLO attacks is essential. However, if
possible, the method most desired is negotiations: a
cease—fire between Israel and the PLO was arranged
by U.S. special envoy Philip Habib last July-.-

For nine months, not a single rocket or shell was
fired by PLO gunners upon Israeli settlers. A

Retaliation for the Thursday shooting of Israel’s
Ambassador to Britian, Shlomo Argor, who was crit-
ically wounded in ‘London, was the justification
Israeli command gave of its air raids. The PLO

- denied any responsibilityiifor the shooting.

If would be insufficient to claﬁn themilitary move
by Israel will severely cripple the PLO; the United
States, without heavy moralizing, should realize
Israel will not soon vacate the region if no other force
appears to clear the region of PLO Israeli-aimed
rockets. The PLO has assembled long-range heavy
artillery, Soviet-built tanks and Soviet-made mobile
launchers that can assault northern Israel .with
deadly force—as has been done. .

As David K. Shipler wrote, the fact that‘these
weapons have been used against Israeli civilians in
response to Israeli air attacks has resolved both mil-
itary and political problems for Mr. Begin.

Some strains with Egyptand Western Europeare
expected by Israeli officials. These have now been
deemed a minor price to pay for what the Begin
government hopes will be a decisive blow to the
PLO.

The cancellation of the “Lou
Grant” show by CBS Television
will disappoint more than just the
civil libertarians and a few devoted
fans. Undoubtedly, there are
numerous journalists ‘who will
miss the once-popular series based
in a Los Angeles newsroom.

1981», there was much speculation
about what type of show it would
be. Thetpublicity hype indicated a
new series featuring Ed Asner, in
his same role of Lou Grant from
the old “Mary Tyler Moore Show”
that had a long successful televi-
sion run. V

At first .it was assumed the new
show would be another situation
comedy, even though the publicity
» indicated otherwise. It was just
hard to imagine Lou Grant as the
serious city editor of a large metro-
politan newspaper instead  a
‘ zany television station manager. It
was like taking Lucy from “I Love
Lucy" to aserious one-hour weekly
series (but not quite!)..

“Lou Grant” opened with both
rave reviews and blasts from jour-
nalists andllaymenialike. Some said
the show told it like it is in the
business. whereas others wrote that
the show was too soft on newspap-
ers and wouldn’t touch the real

uaS not only dealt with the true
issues facing newspaper journal-
ists, but it has featured many of the
problems of society, the nation and
the world.

It has covered political. corrup-
tion, , arson. and the threat, of
nuclear war, and it has covered the
intracacies of the fictitious Los
Angeles Tribune from alcoholism,
confidentiality and libel to petty
rivalries and sexual abuse.

From the cub reporter who has
been on a newspaper for a few
months to-the veteran staff editor,
there doesn’t seem to be much that
the series hasn’t portrayed that
occurs sooner or later in the print
medium. ‘

Those of us who have been in the
business for a while can recognize
situations in which we once found
ourselves a party, and the show has
given us the opportunity to predict"
outcomes and guess what we
would do if. we were in the same
situation.

CBS says that it is cancelling the
show due to poor ratings, but a few
irate fans and the American Civil
Liberties Union think otherwise.
They. believe ‘it is due to Asner’s
political activism.

Asner has long been active in
various protests and recently sup-
ported efforts to send medical aid to
El, Salvador via the leftist insur-
gents in that country.

The show was ranked 21 nation-

ally just before Asner made his Feb- '

ruariy 15 statement about El

Salvador. The next week the show 

was ranked 56 and in the following
periods, 58, 53, 41, 37 and 41. One
of the show’s sponsors, Kimberly-
Clark, has cancelled its
sponsorship. ,

CBS officials deny that Asner’s
political activism had anythiung
to do with the show’s cancellation,

I

V-.

and the Emmy Award-winning A
actor is skeptical about that.

As they say, that's show business,
but if, in fact, Asner’s actions have
played a part in the officials’ deci-
sion, then the officials are wrong.

Hopefully, the decision has been
made purely on the ratings game
that,make or break the networks.
Even though the ratings often kill
good shows early in their prime,
the network bosses have very little
else on which to base their crucial
programming decisions. / ,

They have had a winner in “Lou
Grant,” and we had hoped to see it
around for a while. .

It’s also odd that evidently the
public also met with disfavor
Asner’s remarks about, and sup-
port for El" Salvador’s leftists, and
many of the regular viewers
switched channels on Monday
night. i ‘ ' ,

That one thing we journalists
prize most is at stake here-
freedom of speech,’ and we hope
that Asner’s exercise of that right,
regardless of whether or not we
agree with his opinion, has not
marred his acting career.

As long as he is able to separate

his personal and professional liv,e«%_
there should be no connection o “ '

the two in regard« to the “Lou
Grant” decision.

Policemen and detectives admire
“Hill Street Blues,” and they’re
probably disappointed that “Bar-
ney Miller’,/’ has been cancelled.

The same holds true'for doctors
and nurses. They would probably
be upset if “Quincy” or “Trapper
John, M.D.” were taken off the air.

We journalists think “Lou
Grant” is a good show, and we’ll
miss it. i

Dear Editor:

On Monday, May 17, I was inter-
viewed by The Pitt News as part of
a survey on how foreign students
see the United States. Now that I
have read the result, I feel sure that
I have been somewhat misrepre-
sented—not maliciously so, I am
sure-and now. wish to clarify my
position.

On first being contacted by The
Pitt News, I was led to believe that
the ‘main issue was the Falklands

_ isis, and that having obtained the

~ tin American viewpoint from
Antonio Perez Mata, the wish was
not to talk to someone “from the
other side.” J =

The interview was conducted
~mostly through questions asking
how I thought the British people or
government saw the crisis. I tried to
make it clear that I was not the
-/voice‘ of Britain and that, as far as I
could tell, there were various voi-
ces. All I could do was give an idea
of current opinion. 0 A

The printed interview, however,
makes it sound as if I were all the
time expressing my own views. It

_ glso makes me sound terribly

,_ P‘ ionalistic, even jingoistic: “ ‘We
might not be the world power we
used to be,_ but we’re not going to
let this happen,’ said Jacobson.”
(By the way, why so much “Jacob-
sori”?) I did not say “we,” but
merely that such a feeling existed
in Britain.

from the imposition of socio-

nations, other corporations and
their own corporations organized
along the others’ lines. (As for cul-
ture, let them have Kojak and
Mickey Mouse.)

Some of what “said Jacobson”
and “according to Jacobson,” Jac-
obson did say and was according to
him. Unfortunately, ‘everything
has been lumped together as if it

were an my personal Vome" Colonialism, essentially, is one

of many examples of man's excel-
lence in organizing systems in
which some human beings cheat
and oppress other human beings.
The labels, even in the group-
. ings themselves, are not so impor-
tant as theginj ustice. And evils mix.
Not all Latin Americans are the
innocent exploited. There are
those who still do not accept the
Indians. ‘

The interview also seems out of
place. The series is entitled "To see
ourselves as others see us.” Yet I ’
was asked hardly any questions.
about my viewson the United’
States.

The reader, not knowing this,
might easily conclude that I was
merely trying to get my twopence
in, li_ke politicians who use inter-
views to talk about what they want
to talk about rather than answering
the interviewer’s questions.

It is just those who swear most
tearfully to their flags who use
colonialism for their own ends,
and are willingly used by it. Thus,

\for the Argentinian government,
which mistreats its own people, to
lead a crusade against colonialism
is absurd, not to say sickening.
Only, they know that by using the
world colonialism, especially in
connection with the British, they
will be able to unite many different

Given- that I did end up being
exposed over the Falklands, I
would like to clarify a point I made
and that appears in the interview
and to link it to another point I
made that was not included.

I must admit to drawing a rather
inexact analogy between the Amer-
ican red-under-the-bed 19505 and
the reaction to the word colonial- kinds of people. .

sade works beyond the Argentinian
leaders’*wildest dreams into their
own nightmare. If the»ghosts live,

' Moving on to my related point, I
want to say how saddened I am to
see Nicaragua, of all countries,
support Argentina.

While I understand that they
have been the victims of imperial-
ism, channeled through one of the
nastiest dictators in world history, I
thought they had, through their
struggle, learned to distinguish; to
see what really matters. Support-
ing Argentina makes everything
murkv. ' ‘

Is it really in the best interests of
a long-suffering, heroic people to
back up the aggression of a regime
which has killed at least 10,000 of
its own people and which has
offered troops to kill the people of
El Salvador, a regime which sends
military advisers to Honduras,
whose own government threatens
to invade Nicaragua over a border
dispute? Are they not, in any case,
playing with fire?

It seems that, like the rest of

them, _Nicaragua has decided to
play its hand at international poli

tics, astutely, no doubt. A s

It does stand to win leverage in
the short term, and perhaps this
nation, whose very existence is
threatened, had no other choice.

Yet I do not think titopias can be I
. built with mucky hands, and I

wonder how much will be won in
the long term, even politically.’

--Page »7

I will end on my own weakness. I
.am British. I know that my country
has made many mistakes, and that
it has done some atrocious things.

I also recognize that the Falk-
lands are the result of Britainfs
imperialist past, although I do not

agree that the issue is now colonial. ~

Basically, I think Britain is more in
the right in this dispute that Argen-
tina.

I would not, I hope, support it if
I felt it was in the wrong. Ido not
want there to be a war, and, as I
write this, such words may be being

“blasted into pathos.

-If there is a war, I have to admit

that the tribal instinct, one of our ‘

worst, is inside me too, and that I
would wish my tribe to win.
Although, if it does win, I will only
be a little less unhappy than if it
loses, and more confused. - ‘

Do there have to be only two
alternatives, one chosen by all who
do -not choose the other?

_ In the last resort I can only trust
what seems to be the better part of
me which says, here, to be read, I
would rather my tribe surrender
and go home, than anybody else

Recent Elections  
 Well Attended .

A Dear Editor?

 Ethnicity in developed and

developing societies is fundamen-
tally a political. phenomenon
whereby symbols of the traditional
culture are manipulated as a strate-
gy to gain access, to resources-—-
economic, political, educa-

'tional,..-.. (Abner Cohen,
“Two-Dimensional Man,” 1974).
Symbols which may be articulated
include’ symbols of distinctiveness
such as place of origin,’ skin color,
religion, etc.

Ethnic politics recently occurred
in the Council of Graduate Educa-
tion Students in Education when

certain candidates for office mobil-

 their respective groups-—

’ an and Afro-American——to
win the elections on May. 13.

During the council election
meeting, about a dozen students,
who neither attended any council
meeting nor served on any com-
mittee, flooded the meeting room.
Moreover, the names of these stu-

dents were not on the list of active

members having voting privileges
on all matters. A graduate student
in education becomes an active
member by filling out an applica-
tion form and participating in at
least 50 percent of council
activities—ineetings or committee
work.

 It was apparent that the above-
mentioned visitors came to the ,

meeting to vote for certain candi-
dates who invited them to come to
the meeting. In essence, these can-
didates, articulating their respec-
tive identities——African and
Afro-American, mobilized
members of respective collectivi-
ties. Not all African students,
though, participated in the mobili-
zation efforts.

Being a former council officer
and member of the Bylaws Com-
mittee reponsible for the amend-
ments embodied in the current

 laws, I strongly support the

ouncil ideas and commitments.
Thus, to prevent a potential ethnic
coup during the meeting, I read
sections of the bylaws dealing with
voting privileges and definitions of

active. membership. ’

The council came into being not
for ethnic competition nor promo-
tion of individual and collective
interests. The council has dedi-
cated itself to the promotion of aca-
demic, professional and . social
welfare of all graduate students in
the school of education as defined
by its bylaws. «

The question I raised created
heated debates among concerned
individuals. The Elections Com-
mittee chairperson and two officers
made a strong suggestion to adhere
to the bylaws. A council member
suggested postponement of’ the
election so that the meaning of the

bylaws could be clarified. The vis- , -

The Elections Committee and
the entire council, unable to cope
with the situation, became easy vic-

tion with the council.

Here are some things I think I

dates who mobilized members of
respective ethnic groups won. To;
endorse election results, even by
mere silence or indifference, is to
condone violation of the council
bylaws which will encourage the
use of similar strategy in the future.
Therefore, it is only appropriate
and just that the outcome of the
May 13 elections be overturned.

the committee, are at each other's

PSN DidNot

Dear Editor:

. The photograph on page two of
the Wednesday, May 19, 1982 issue
of The Pitt News is in error; the

’ caption indicates that the demon-

stration in favor of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO)
was sponsored’ and organized by
the Pitt Progressive Student Net-
work along with another group.

This is not true: this demonstra-
tion was not organied by the Pit-t
PSN——it ‘was organized by a
member of\PSN, Dana Reed.

The Pitt PSN was organized in
January 1982 and was quite active
on campus until the end of the win-
ter term; the group consisted of
about twenty students organized
under democratic principles,
according to the. Pitt PSN Consti-

. tution (which I drafted and which

the group unanimously approved.)

The Pitt PSN Constitution
expressly indicated that the group
would not take a position of any
issue until the group met to discuss
and vote on the specific issue.

Also, the group was pledged to

operate according to principles of;

non-violence as advocated by Reve-
rend Dr. Martin Luther King.

Finally, the group decided nht to
conduct business until classes
resumed in the fall.

Reed obviously felt that the Pitt
PSN Constitution did not prevent
him from doing as he pleased. The
demonstration last Friday was not
sponsored by the Pitt PSN; it was
planned, organized and led by
Reed. _ ’

I must stress again that Reed’

acted totally without authoriza-
tion. There was rio meeting of the
Pitt PSN at all, let alone a vote on
whether or not to support the PLO
against Israel. — ,

In conclusion, the demonstra-
tion could not possibly have been
sponsored by the Pitt PSN. First of
all, therewas no meeting orvote on
‘the issue. ’ .

Secondly, the Pitt PSN (as a

. group) decided before the end of
J the winter term that there would be
no uofficial ‘business conducted’
by until classes resumed in the fall. ,

' ‘Address submissions to The

Sponsor PLO Rally

’ Thirdly, if the issue» had in fact

been discussed by the PSN, there.

would have been quite an outburst
from within the group over sup-
porting a terroristic organization
such as the PLO. 5

The actions of Reed in misre-
presenting the Pitt PSN were not
only irresponsible but completely
deceitful. '

I

I was present at the demonstra-

tion and marched with the small
group (five persons) of students
whosupported Israel’. There is no
way that I would support the PLO,
an organization which has proved
to be devoid of morals and princi-
ples time and time again, and
which is dedicated to driving the
people of Israel into the sea.

Although I am not of the Jewish i

faith, I strongly support‘ Israel's
right to statehood——until the PLO.
pledges to end its terroristic drive to
push Israel into the sea, there
should be no negotiations with or

recognition of the PLO by Israelor

the United States.

The only path to peace in.the
Middle East lies in agreement of
both sides to cease fire and talk
sensibly. A’

de Story:

The Gala Event  

When the Women’s Committee
at Carnegie lnstitute’s Museum of
Art planned the first Three Rivers
Arts Festival in 1960,~little did they
dream that it would become the ten-
day gala event that is as much a part
of Pittsburgh’s summer as hot
weather and baseball.

According to Paula Atlas, who

1 has been with the festival for twenty
years and is currently the executive
assistant, “the director (of the Insti-
tute) felt that an outreach program
was needed because people weren’t
coming to the museum like they do
now.”

“The idea was to have a place to
show paintings outside the museum
where people could feel comforta-
ble, and also to showcase the work
of regional artists,” said Public Rela-
tions Director Nancy Brem.

“There were very few festivals at
that time. There was one in Boston
which the women researched very
carefully,” said Atlas. ‘

The festival was originally held for
three days.

“There were maybe two hundred
paintings and two performances at
the first one,” said Brem.

All of the displays were located at-
the old Point, near the tip of the
river, where Point State Park is now.

“Since that time the festival has
grown in size, scope and stature,”
Brem said.

“The spin-off from the festival has

been enormous; it’s been an explo-
sion,” said Atlas. -

Today, the ten-day festival, run-
ning June 4-13, displays hundreds of
works of art and sponsors over 100
performances.

The festival
longer, were it left up to Atlas, who
said, “I feel it should (run longer). It’s
so big now that it can be a resource
for other things.

“I would like to see a fall festival,
something in Oakland would be fun.
But it’s all just a big vague idea in the
back; of my hea .”

Over the years, the festival has
spread out over the city. There are

might run even.

.8urrdayafter'noon’sperformanoeatthemain

now eight locations: Gateway Cen-
ter, . Point State Park, Station
Square, Allegheny County Court-
house, the Arcade Theater in South
Side, the Art Institute of Pittsburgh,
the Greater Pittsburgh International
Airport and Pittsburgh Center for
the Arts in Shadyside.

This year, the festival has also

expanded the areas from which the.

artists are drawn, including all of
Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia

- and western New York.

Even though the present-day fes-
tival isvmuch larger than the 1960
festival, some things, like the
weather, always seem to interfere.

“The first year atornado blew the
whole thing into the river,” said
Atlas. s

This year’s weather hasn’t been
quite that bad, but the rain probably
discouraged some people from ven-
turing outdoors.

But rain isn’t the only thing that
might keep people away. The con-
struction downtown might make it
harder for people to get around.

“We’ve tried to keep a positive
attitude about the construction,"
said Brem. “The first day was one of
the best, so if anything hurts us, it’s
probably the weather.”

At least one measure has been
taken to insure that the festival pro-
ceeds as planned.

“We have a wonderful new cover
for the stage,” said Atlas. This
means that performances can go on
even if the weather is bad, provided
there are enough people in the
audience.

“People come even when the
weather is bad. Saturday nightthere
were about 300 people at the con-
cert, even though it was freezing
and wet,” said Brem.

If a performance can’t go on as
planned, it is usually postponed.

“We always try toreschedule, but
it’s hard when the schedule is tight,”
said Atlas.

Both Brem and Atlas are quick to
point out just how important contri-

     

stage.

Caricature drawing is just one of the fun things to" do at th

butions of volunteers are to the suc-
cess of the festival.

“It couldn’t happen without
them,” said Atlas. “The staff is small,
so the volunteers "do the planning
and organizational work. I

“We always find new volunteers
to take new responsibilities. Even
special projects have their,‘ own
volunteer committees.” I «.

Something else -that can be
counted on is free admission to all of
the festival’s activities, except the
films at the Arcade Theater. ,

One special new item at this
year’s festival is Michael Tych’s
award-winning display system,
which has replaced the red and yel-
low pavillions of years past. ‘

The display modules ‘provide
weather protection as well as an
attractive environment for the paint-
ings in the 4 Gateway Center plaza.

In addition to the display systems,
a number of new activities have
been added to this year's festival.

Foreign films from seven different

Pieces such as the big yellow

The Youngman piece, in particu-
lar, was the result of the effort of a

“It was done with the cooperation
of a number of Pittsburgh busi-
nesses. The material were produced

Not all the arts at this year’s
Three Rivers Arts Festival will be
displayed at the Point. For the first
time in the festival’s 23-year history,
feature films are being shown nightly
at the Arcade Theater, 915 East
Carson Street, on the city’s South
Side. . .

The idea, according to Film Festi-
val Chairman Bill Judson, had been
discussed for a long time.

“lt’s something that a number of
people had ‘talked about over the

years, and it seemed to be a good
year to do it.'The Three Rivers Arts
Festival seemed like a good
umbrella under which to do it. They
were very interested, and there was

. ?undation support from the Pitts-
. i _ urgh Foundation,” said Judson.

Judson, curator of film and video
at the Museum of Art, Carnegie
Institute, worked with Geralyn Hux-

‘ ley, also of the Museum of Art, and
Marilyn Levin, of Pittsburgh Film

Makers, in putting the film festival

together.

“What we were trying to do was
to put together an interesting series

' of films which people not only

haven’t had a chance to see, but that
I think in_ some cases could play
theatrically,” Judson said.

Aside from testing the market for
such films in Pittsburgh, Judson
believes, the films might do better
some had previously thought.

wanted to do films that
nevertheless might turn out to have
a lotmore interest among the peo-
ple in Pittsburgh than might have
been guessed,” according to
Judson; ‘

As a result, the films featured
have ranged from the documentary
“Soldier ‘Girls” to the Grand Prize
Winner of the 1981 Cannes Film
Festival, “Man of Iron” to the flesh-.
eating zombies of George Romero’s
“Dawn of the Dead.” '

Romero,,a local film maker, had
four of his films shown at the film
festival this past weekend.

~.“We also wanted to give at least
part of the festival a certain focus,
I 4 we thought, certainly the first
yeai, it was -appropriate to focus on
features made in Pittsburgh by Pitts-

burghers. And Romero is obviously ~

a key figure in all that,” Judson
explained.

“Effects,” a ﬁlm by Dusty Nelson
in the tradition of Romero and made
locally, was also screened this past
weekend as were 16 millimeter ﬁlms
from the juried film show at the arts
festival. The juried films will con-
tinue being shown as shorts during

-the restof the festival, according to

Judson. The festival continues
through June 13. V

“In the case of the prizewinners,
they’re being shown a couple of
times, so that people who go to see
the features will also get a chance to
see the different shorts as well,”
Judson said.

Beyond the juried shorts, the fes-
tival is trying to ‘spread the selec-
tions made over a number of
cultures and languages, according
to Judson. Films from Italy, Ger-

many, Switzerland, France and 3

Poland highlight the festival.

We were trying to create that var- -

iety, a number of different cultures,”
Judson said. ,
One of the problems with organiz-
ing the festival was, according to
Judson, the unpredictable availabil-
ity of the films.
I It took a long time, partly because

/

Seezox D00“?

Films Join Festival

we were looking at a lot of films
which might or might not open
theatrically, depending upon, in
other words, what might or might

not happen -with the Academy-

Awards, or‘wl'iat a cinema or other
exhibitors might decide. ’ —
“We’d try to line stuff up,a‘nd then‘
discover that a film had opened
theatrically. That’s terrific, but it
wouldn’t make much sense for us to

do it. So we did an awful lot of shift- a

ing around to keep the balance that
we wanted, but still representing
films that hadn’t shown up. An awful
lot of negotiating went on that way.”
Judson said.

The overall balance that was
hoped for was one that was, accord-
ing to Judson, representative of dif-
ferent. cultures.

“We didn’t intend, certainly not
this time around, to be inclusive.
There aren’t any Third-World films,
for example,” he‘ said. .

There wasn’t a set festival struc?
ture, Judson said, even though a
rough outline did exist in the minds
of the festival staff.

“We didn’t have a complete

' checklist saying, ‘well, we have one

of these, get one of those,’ and so
forth. The bottom line was that we
were trying to put togéther a pro-
gram of good films.”

An example of this is the two Pol-

ish films being screened throughout .

the festival, according to Judson.

‘ “The two Polish films are, again, a
processof putting the whole thing

together. We thought that “Man of

Iron” might‘ open theatrically. At
first it, appeared that it wouldn’t,
then it appeared that it would, then
again that it wouldn’t,” Judson said.

In the meantime, however,
another film, “The Contract,” by
Polish director Krysztof Zanussi,
whom Judson referred to as “a
really fascinating, very productive

Polishdirector,” became available.

“So webooked that. Then when

“Man of Iron” became_available, we
thought that was a really important
film to show. We needed to do it,
since it wasn’t going to open theatri-

cally, and there was no point in elimi- -

nating the Zanussi film.

“lt’s well worth having two Polish
films,” Judson explained. CW

JIM CARROLL (BAND
Heaven

June 3, 1982

Listening to Jim Carroll spit out
the words, ‘‘I was a Catholic
child," makes you realize what
rock and roll is supposed to be
about, and what fired it in the first

. place. His anger is complemented

by his band, which spews forth a
violent barrage of noise, whipping
it around furiously.  .

But Carroll himself seems at

odds with what he puts forth; he’s?‘

the calm eye of a hurricane, a hurri-
cane that is purely his creation.
This is what-makes him so fasci-
nating, and so dangerous.
Looking a little like David

Bowie, but lacking blood, and

drained of the experience that
oozed through “The Basket-Ball
Diaries,” Carroll seemed an empty
page, devoid of any opinion until
he opened his mouth. Then it all

spilled out, in abrupt, caustic

songs meant to bite the heads off

the audience. .

_ Carroll’s relationship with his
audience floats on its complexity.
fln his last appearance in Pitts-
burgh, he arrived on stage three
hours late, sang three songs and
then told ‘the audience to go to hell
since they were all dying of luke-
mia anyway.

This evening,‘ although he was
the picture of professionalism,
there was a feeling that he still held
a lingering contempt for his
audience. There is an awareness
that he needs to be in front of an
audience, but none that he enjoys
being there. '

-‘Rock and roll may be his-mania,
but Jim Carroll is an uncomforta-
ble prisoner, not a joyous one.

The Silencers, who opened the

_'show, are a bunch of uncompli-

cated prisoners themselves. Giving
their .usual tight show, they still

rest entirely on Frank Czuri’s R8cB

tinged voice to get them beyond
mere competence into occasionally
soulful brilliance.

.Jim Carroll and The Silencers
are as different-as it is possible to_ be
in a place like Heaven, but they
ultirriately end up in the same area
when they are at their best. Despite
any limitations that hold them
back, they both manage at

   

The Pitt News, Wednesday,

    

moments to spit out that most
necessary, but elusive, aspect of
rockiand roll-passion.

That's what it’s all about, and
Jim Carroll seems determined, des-.
pite himself, not to lose it. The last
I saw of him he was disappearing

‘down a dark alley in the middle oil

.the night, and as I waved at him
from a brightly lit White Tower, he
seemed fragile and old, but rejuv-
enated by the possibilities before

him.
Being a Catholic boy, he doesn't i

really have any choice.

‘MISSIN TWENTY GRAND

David Lasley
EMI/America

David Lasley has quietly gone
about his business the past few
years and in the process has made a
significant impact on much of our
popular music.

Who? ’ Like
songwriters and session men, Las-
ley has retained relative a_nonymity
despite his prolific writing and
touring -with artists like James
Taylor, Boz Scaggs, Aretha Frank-
lin, Bonnie Raitt and others. Keep-
ing those proven skills in mind,
one might expect Lasley's first solo
effort to deliver the goods. And it
does—-at times. i

Lasley’s writing attemptsa

going home of sorts by utilizing the-

sights, sounds and characters of his
many stomping grounds. “On
Third Street” recalls the growin’
up years in Detroit: “In a -way I
learned a lesson, In a way I feel
ripped off/ When you’re fifteen you
always gonna pay the cost.”

Such "urban romanticism” has
in. the past managed scathing por-
trayals of city streets and their anti-
heroes (Ricki Lee Jones’ “Pirates,”
Bruce Springsteen’s “The Wild,
The Innocent 8c The E. St.
Shuffle”). /

Although it contains similar sce-
narios, “Missin’ Twenty Grand”
never fully captures the mood and

textures of the works. _What’s miss- _

-ing is that sound of pain. that best

accompanies” these types of songs,

the kind of pain found on a Tom

1Waits or Jim Carroll album.

The musical ingredients are
t-here-—the riffs of fusion and funk

so many other

that bop you down the sidewalk-- .

Maybe someday they’ll make a
great Star Trek picture. Until that
happens, we must settle for “Star
Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,” a
Grade C space opera.

The producers of this movie
tried conscientiously not to repeat
the mistakes of the first Star Trek
movie. That movie had no real vil-
lain, only a computer so powerful
that it eventually became a god.
This type of “cosmic meaning”
plot must be done well to work.
“Star Trek: The Motion Picture”
didn’t work.

i “The Wrath of Khan” is an/_
adventure movie centered on the

old-fashioned theme of revenge.
Kirk had marooned Khan and his
band of mutineers on a planet 15
years ago in the TV series. In the
movie, Khan gains control of a

i starship and goes out gunning for

Kirk. As a pawn in this battle is a
machine that can destroy and
create life, the Genesis device.

Another criticism of the first,

movie was its lack of emphasis on
the characters. People wanted to
see more of the personal lives of the
Enterprise crew. In responding to
this valid complaint, the writers of
the second movie went into over-
kill. The soapy subplots are
numerous. Will Kirk be able to face
growing old? Will Lieutenant Saa-
vik, a female Vulcan, overcome her
initial failure to command success-
fully? Will the son of the Genesis
project's head researcher get over
his hatred of Kirk? Will Kirk's crew
of young cadets survive the battles
with Khan? _
Developing well one or two of

, these plots in addition to the main

plot would be enough. Dealing
with all four is ridiculous, and each
receives only superficial treatment.

Instead of the movie. providing‘

/

The Pique of Khan

answers, we’re sorry it ever asked
the questions.

The writers also sacrificed real-
ism for dramatic shocks. Th-ere is
nothing wrong with this in a space

‘opera, but it was done clumsily.

The well-trained Star Fleet officers
are always doing nonsensical
things. When one of Engineer
Scott's cadets is injured in a battle,
Scott brings the dying man onto
the bridge. There is a terrific shot of
the elevator doors opening on the
bleeding body. However, if I were
the cadet, I would have preferred to
go to Sickbay.

Adventure movies depend on
coincidences and improbable.
actions, but the Star Trekwriters
said, “Oh, no one will notice” too
many times. The movie depends on’
the fact that no one noticed a planet
blowing up, or that a new planet
can form out of dust’ and gas,
develop an atmosphere andtgrow
plant life in two days. A free-falling
object enters this atmosphere. Not
only .does it not burn up, but
instead of crashing as a result of its
large velocity it, lays peacefully in
the newborn jungle. Apparently
the writers thought that physical
laws such as friction and velocity

-can be used or not used according
to the needs of the story. '

What the illogical, superficial
plot and characters add up to is an
empty movie. Events important to
the characters occur, but the
audience is whizzed by at warp 10
instead of being allowed to explore
the meaning of a single incident. If
the producers wanted to make a
good adventure movie, they should
have stayed away from so many
subplots and crafted a well
thought-out plot.

Diner: The Place To Go

'We’re older now; we’re cooler,
and we're still hangin’ out.-—
Shrevie

Baltimore, 1959. Dec. 25-31. As

.the sun rises behind Fells Point

Diner, six friends in dark overcoats

have decided to call it a night.

Tomorrow, they’ll return to the
diner for french fries and gravy,
and for the security of a shelter
wher_e living comes naturally.

“Diner” is a film about the rite of
passage from adolescence to man-
hood. The theme should imme-
diately conjure images of
“American Graffiti,” but Barry
Levinson, who directed his screen-
play, presents this period in a
much more subtle, manner. He
should‘ be praised for being true to
his characters rather than sacrific-
ing them for the plot.

“Diner” is like a sketch that-takes
the form of a short story as opposed
to that of a novel. Levinson relies

 but Lasley’s high falsetto fails to '

wear well over the length of the
album.

His shrilling pitch works best on
the- ballads, especially “Take a
,Look,” and survives others thanks
to such backing vocalists as Bonnie
Raitt,’ James Taylor and Luther
VanDross. Pete Townshend
cameos on guitar on “Roommate,"
a fact destined for the realm of

. trivia.

What we are left with is a collec-
tion of well-written and enjoyable
songs that serve as personal
vignettes of an artist, yet they fail to
give us the images necessary to
complete the story. ’

Why Cooney Will

   

Viewpoint
By BARR} ZASIOFF

Qis opponent calls him “The
Great White Dope,” or sometimes
“The Great White Hype” and adds
that his mere presence inside the
squared ring will be made possible
by his skin color——whit_e—which
will increase box office receipts,
thus giving promoters substantial
reason to open their arms wide.

His skeptics say he is a brawler,
not a boxer, that he has made a
living by defeating over-the-hill
fighters and that he has not earned
a shot at the championship.

‘The chalk players are booking
him as a nine—to~five underdog,
which is not promising unless
y§f””!kae, dealing with Dolly Parton’s
job aspirations.

On the surface, it appears as if
challenger Gerry Cooney has about
as much as a chance of defeating
reigning champion Larry Holmes
in their scheduled“l5-round World
Boxing Council match at Caesars
Palace this Friday night as the
Argentinian Army has of wiping-
out the British troops. A

Despite his cynics and the seem-
ingly overwhelming odds that he i
faces, Cooney will depart from his
home in Huntington, N.Y., and
will arrive at Las Vegas with all of
his artillery packed into two mas-
sive arms.

" f it.

He will return. home with the
heavyweight championship belt
wrapped around his waist,

Sure, Larry Holmes is 39-0, with
29 of the wins coming by knockout.
Yes, he has : an awesome jab.
Holmes is exceptionally strong
and just as quick, but he has never
faced a fighter as powerful as
Cooney.

~~ Holmes is 33-years old and a step
slower than he was a few years
back. In his most recent match
against unheralded Renaldo
Snipes, Holmes had considerable
difficulty ducking the hooks of
Snipes, twice having been knocked
to the canvas.

Now Holmes must face the dou-

ble and triple hooks of Cooney,-

regarded by his peers as the most
devastating in the sport. Cooney
may be a brawler, a street fighter,
but his massive arms and bone-
crunching punches make him a
great boxer. And dangerous.

Cooney is also undefeated, 25-0,
with 21 of the wins being knock-
touts. Eight times he has disposed of
his opponent before the end of the
first round. In his last two fights he

had thrashed Ron Lyle and Ken’

Norton before he could work up a
sweat. I

He is on the upswing; Holmes
on the way down.

Holmes has made Cooney even
hungrier than normal, and in the
process, he has given a vicious figh-
ter added incentive to bring out the
killer instinct. Holmes has told

everyone who would listen that.

Why Holmes Will

 

By scon DELLETT

He has defeated all 39 of his
opponents, 29 of them having’
remained on the canvas. He has

accepted and defeated all takers.
Yet he still receives no respect. Can
LarryHolmes do anything right?

Skeptics say that he fights infe-
rior competition and hasn’t been

~ able to put them away quickly_

enough. Yet Holmes has faced

, eleven challengers since he cap-
_tured the title from Ken Norton in

 

ampionship J

Gerry Cooney will be wearing the World Boxing Counc

night.

Cooney isn’t worthy of a shot at the
title, saying that he doesr_1_’t belong
in the same ring, and that his pur-
pose was solely as a drawing card-—
a boxer to whom the white

spectator can relate, and will watch .

battle the black myth.

Retain T

I978, and he has defeated all of
them, ten by knockouts.

Next comes Gerry Cooney, the
“Great White Hope,” the slugger
with the powerful left hook that
has levelled 21 out of 25 opponents
that have tried to knock Holmes
from the World Boxing Council
heavyweight throne. Finally, the

Larry Holmes will prove that Gerry Cooney is little more than a hope. , o I

, Cooney has heard the noise from

Holmes’s corner, and has only

offered, “what does my race have to
do with anything.” His anger must
be"reaching a climax.

He will release his frustrations
by knocking Holmes around the

war of words will be settled and the
actual fighting will be done when
the two warriors enter Caesars
Palace Friday night. And if the
oddsmakers are right, Holmes will
win. If anyone plans to turn the
fight into a business deal, take the
champion.

Why will Holmes win? First,
Holmes is simply the better boxer.
He: uses an awesome jab to set up
his opponents for his best pitch, an
overhand right,,which has taken its

toll in the 29 knockouts.

Cooney, meanwhile, is merely a
puncher, not a boxer. He has a
great left hook, but there is some
doubt about his right hand. Coo-

_ney can only throw a limited

amount of left hooks, particularly
since he is fighting an experienced
boxer. ‘

Many have questioned Holmes’s'
opponents, but what about Coo-
ney? Who has he fought? Do the
names Leroy Boone, Jimmy Sykes
or Eddie Lopez send a shiver of fear
down your spine? There has been
talk that Holmes caught some
great “name fighters way past their
prime, but Cooney faced Jimmy
Young, Ron Lyle and Ken
Norton—-all on the verge ofending
their respective careers.

Holmes can go the distance, but
can Cooney? In the past two years,
Cooney has only boxed six rounds.
The longest he has ever gone is

.eight rounds——twice--against the

infamous Lopez and Sam McGill
of Wilkinsburg. There is the ques-
tion of Cooney going 15 rounds-—
especially in the brutal heat of Las
Vegas, while Holmes has gone at
least seven rounds in 10 of his ll
title defenses.

Holmes has proven he is a great
boxer while Cooney is still a raw
young talent. Holmes will be

il championship belt next Friday

ring and he will prove that he is no
dope and no hype.

He will make the unfortunates
who laid nine—to-five a little lighter
in the wallet.

The prediction here: Cooney in 7.

rounds.

he Championship

teaching several lessons to Cooney
Friday night. » .
Still, if Holmes wins convinc

ingly, there - may not be an
improvement on his reputation as
‘the champion. Cooney will be clas-
sified as--using the Holmes
saying-—“a Great White Dope,”
along with such boxers as Duane

‘ Bobick and Scott LeDoux. How-

ever, this notion is not true.
Although Michael’ Dokes and Greg
Page may be better boxers, Cooney
is thebetter talent. In one more

year, he may be the-heavyweight

champion -of the world, but not
right now.

But Holmes will have to take this A

fight seriously. Cooney, despite his
lack of boxing experience, will be
the champion’s stiffestchallenge of

. his reign so far. Even though Coo-

ney has only the left book, one left
to the jaw could put Holmes down.

_and remove the belt from his waist.

(Hello critics.)Which means that
Holmes cannot be overconfident.

Larry Holmesmaybe 33 years
old, he may have fought some
shabby opponents and he may be
slowing down, but he wants this
fight more than Cooney. He wants
to silence his critics. Holmes has a
lot of pride. He's probably sick of
hearing people questioning his
ability as a fighter, let alone as a
champion. He expressed the desire
to be compared with such boxing
greats as Marciano, Louis and Ali.

The man deserves a better fate, a
little more respect. If he wins with-
out breaking a sweat, Cooney will
be called another pretender. If
Holmes loses, he will become
another champion who fed-off

Gymnastlmproving

By BRIAN BALK

Lady Panther gymnastics Coach ,

Donna Sanft summerized her out-
look for the upcoming season with
a series of question marks. Who
will be healthy? “Will the injuries
from last season heal? How can the
vacated senior spots be filled? The
unanswered questions continue; so
many that it seems as if the team
belongs on a daytime soap saga.

Sanft cannot determine fate, nor
can‘ she consult the Shell Answer
Man.“Thus, to compensate for the
"list of questions left hanging, she is
“overpreparing” to make next
year's Lady Panther one of the
strongest teams evei.

Bad luck reeked havoc on last
year's team, which finished with a
5-6 record. “I was dissappointed
with last year's record; I think the
girls deserved better than they

received,” Sanft said.

All losing teams conjure up
excuses to ‘explain their team’s
problems. However, the only via-
ble excuse that the Lady Panthers
could use was fate itself.

“We weredevistated by injuries.
Over one third of our team was out
all season long with injuries,”
explained Sanft. “It was
unbelievable-—just a freaky turn of
events.”

To reassure that the Lady Pan-
thers will not collide again, with
injuries next season, Sanft is con-

~ centrating on adding some depth

to the team. New faces in the form
of recruits have surfaced in the

m. -

Sanft did notihave to search any
further than Baldwin to lure Jackie
Caldarone——her first top-flight
recruit. Caldarone captured fourth
place in the all-around competi-
tion in last year’s state
championships.

She is a very powerful gymnast
with great flexibility,” Sanft said.

;

Sanft tags Caldarone as “the sort
of talent that hasn’t been developed
yet.” Since she has only been in the
sport a mere four years—-a rela-
tively short period for a gymnast"-
her potential has not yet been
reached, explained Sanft.

“Jackie is like a lotof girls on the
team——she is on the verge of learn-
ing new tricks. I think she'll fit
right in. ' r

Sanft commented about her
second outstanding recruit, Kristy
Pieters, from Whiting, Ind., “she is
the most powerful gymnast I have
ever seen—she does unbelievable
bar and floor routines.

“I_ saw her get right off an
Achilles’ injury aridthrow just an
unreal floor rcrutine,” said Sanft
with an optimistic glow. ‘

The amazing aspect about Piet-
ers is that even though she can exe-
cute‘ multiple I twists and
revolutions on the ground with
ease, the floor exercise is not her
best event.

Said Sanft: “Kristy’s strongest
and most consistent event is ,_the
uneven bars.” .

Other recruits include accom-
plished gymnast Stacey Constica,
Shellie Dubik and Sherie Rebach.

The biggest asset that the newly
acquired recruits as well as the
present members of the team hold
is their dedication.

“We have a bunch of workers on
the team. Everyone is totally dedi-
cated to success,” boasted Sanft.

“The loss of seniors to gradua-
tion will have a great impact,” said
Sanft, but hopefully the spots will

_ be filled.

One member whose absence is
truly missed within the walls of

Trees Hall gymnasium is last/

year’s spiritual leader, Holly
Martino. I
“Holly was a rock in terms of
mental attitude. Everyone looked
up to her for inspiration, especially

when we were down. No matter
what the circumstances were, she
was up at practice, pluggingit
away,” Sanft, said. Finding a
replacement for Martino, a two-
year co-caption and three-year
MVP, will be a tough job. _,

One question Sanft can accu-
rately answer is what are going to
be the strong and weak events.
Without hesitation, Sanft predicts:
“We are going to have totally awe-
some bars.” With two top fresh-

man uneven bar performers, last

,-year’s national uneven bar cham-
pion Lisa Shirk, and three
members returning with All-East
honors (Shirk, Karen Martin and
Gretchen Spiech), there is little
doubt the Lady Panthers are going
to be a dominating force on uneven
bars.

ymnast Lia Shirl: returns "ext seaso, along  severl

The Lady Panthers will have to
concentrate on untangling the
knots of their weakest event——the
vault. Losing Regina Carson and
Martino, two of the team’s most
consistent vaulters, will hurt the
squad. Add two inexperienced
freshman vaulters, - inadequate
equipment and a slew of ankle and
knee injuries, and it makes for an
extremely feeble vaulting crew.

In the vault, Sanft hopes to use
the talent of two gymnasts who did
not see any actionrlast year. She is
relying on senior Babbie Flock,
who was out all last season with
mononucleosis, -and sophomore
Debbie Dabkowski, who tore liga-
ments and cartilage in her left knee
beforelast season began. I

erate from her injury-—if anyone _
can recuperate from an operation
such‘ as that, she can,” said 
Dabkowski underwent a con"il°p‘ie-$8‘
knee reconstruction last October
after/a fall she suffered in the USGF
Championships in August.
“Babbie could come back and be
a great all-around performer for
us,” Sanft emphasized. After a suc-
cessful freshman season, Flock ran
into a spell of ill-luck, and the last
two years have been filled, with a
series ofbad breaks. However, with
her great strength and her drive for
improvement, Flock may become a
key member of the squad next fall.
“Getting a pit is the next logical
step in creating a safer environ-
ment,” explained Sanft. A “pit” is
a six to seven foot-deep encase
filled with foam rubber. This piece

of equipment permits the gymn_'*_j' 3*,
to land without suffering even”"a”"L”

scratch. The pit is the latest in gym-
nastics technology; Sanft hopes to
keep up the pace with advances to
improve the program.

With the new top recruits and
ever-present dedication toward
winning, it appears as if the Lady
Panther gymnasts are on their way
to a successful season. And if Coach
Sanft’s “overpreparation strategy”
works, it will make the questions a
little bit easier to answer.

Williams Moving To Forward?

COTT DELLETT

  
 

Since recent Pitt Panther basket-
ball teams have had their problems
in finding a true center, they have
been forced to use a forward in the
pivot spot. - ‘

Every Panther fan remembers
Tim Grugrich, and later Roy
Chipman, saying that they would
remove Sam Clancy from the center
position and place him at power

or Leonard “Truck” Robinson of
the Phoenix Suns is summoned.

With a 6-8, 190 pound frame,
Williams does not fit into the
mold. So ‘he has been diligently
working on a specially-designed
program, and the results are begin-
ning to show.

“I’ve been working out with
Buddy Morris (the Pitt football

~ team’s weight training coach) to

improve my strength,” Williams

the National Sports Festival, to be

‘ held in late July in Indianapolis.

Thecoach of the East squad—-
Jim Boeheim of Syracuse-——was
active in trying to lure Williams to
the Orangemen.

“It is a good feeling to ‘play with
guys who will be in the Big East,”
Williams said.

Like most people involved with
the Pitt basketball program, Willi-
ams is looking forward to playing

forward SIM, but the Candidates at said. “I” am already up to 210 i.n“the‘presti’giou.s league. ”
Center. would never pan out and pounds. . : _l_think it sa very good league,
The weight program has also Williams said. “I hope we can pl-ay

Clancy V would end up toiling
against players four or five inches
 er than him.

   

“The same thing happened to
sophomore Andre Williams last
season. Steve Beatty didn’t measure
up to the coaches’ expectations and
Williams was forced to play the
unnatural pivot spot.

Both Williams and assistant
coach Seth Greenberg have agreed.
that the power’ forward position is
Williams’ best position. ,

“Andre has the potential to be an
outstanding power forward,”
Greenberg said. “He has every-
thing a power forward needs but
strength.” '

“I feel more comfortable when I
have a- chance to‘ face the basket
' ad of having my back against

Wit,” Williams said.

With the recent signing of 6-8
1/2 Keith Armstrong, who has
been favorably compared to Clancy’
and the probable loss of starting
forward Roosevelt Kirby due to
academic difficulties, both Willi-
ams’ and the coaches’ wishes may
come true. - .

Williams, who saw considerable
playing time at the power forward
position at Murray Berghaum
High School in New York, had
some sparkling statistics coming
out of high school. In his senior
year, Williams scored 21 points a

. game while pulling down 12

rebounds and handing out seven

V a.ssists——the latter being extremely

> ‘e’ for a big man.

With Syracuse, St. Bonaventure,
St. Peter and Boston College
recruiting him, Williams selected,
Pitt because of the campus atmos-
phere and the progressing basket-
ball program. .

“When I- made my visit to the
area, the people treated me really

‘ good,” Williams said. “The city-

type background of the university

prevents me from becoming.

homesick.” _
At first, Williams’ ‘playing time
was minimal, as the coaching staff

i tried to bring the incoming fresh-

man along slowly. But after a.four-
game ‘ losing streak and the
di ~ pointing play of Beatty, Wil-

 was given the starting center
position. —

improved Williams’ wobbly knees.

“The right knee is fine now," he
said, “but the left is still weak. I’ve
been working on leg machines to
strengthen it up.”

Williams added, “I need to
improve my rebounding and my
concentration.” ( - ,

Summer is the time where col-
lege basketball players improve
their skills either in the empty
gyms or the hot asphalt courts on
the outside. Williams will have the
opportunity to perform against the
best freshman and sophomores
around the country, as he was
selected to play for the”East team in

well.”

His game will be dictated by
what the coaches want him to do.

“I think of myself as a role
player,” he said. “I have to grab the
rebound and put the ball into the
hole.” ,

Although he has no hero, Willi-
ams said that he admires the play of
Moses Malone of the Houston
Rockets and Kareem Abdul Jabbar
of the Los Angeles Lakers.
._ “I like the way they control the
court," he said.

The type of control" Williams

would like to have, no matter

Williams responded well to the
challenge. He finished the season
with an "average of 6.4 points and
4.3 rebounds per game. Not All-
America statistics, but Williams
was facing players with more
strength, and he was playing with
tendonitis in both knees.

He made two game-winning
-baskets against Duquesne, which
prompted Greenberg to say,“how
many freshmen in the country
scored winning baskets against
thtér arch-rivals last season?"

. reenberg explained that Willi-
a ns has the potential to be one of
 e top forwards in the country,
yisng, “he had a super freshman
year, which would have been even
better if his knees were sound.

Williams was a little more mod-
est on his self-evaluation. ‘

"I think I did fairly well,” he
said. ‘‘I didn’t expect to start or
play as much as I did.”

According to Greenberg, Willi-
am; has many assets that help him
both as a power forward and at the
low and high post.

“He is very quick, is an excellent
passer and a good shooter," Green-
berg said. Playing the post last sea-
on was an advantage to him.”
