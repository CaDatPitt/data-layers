Chancellor ’s exit provokes criticism

By Suzann Gries
News Editor

Pitt Professor Richard Tobias walked out
of Monday’s Senate Council meeting after
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor left the
meeting without explanation.

Tobias, former president of the
University Senate, called for the meeting
to be adjourned because, according to the
Senate Council’s by-laws, there is sup-
posed to be at least 50 percent of the vot-
ing members present. Since there were
not enough members there, Senate
Council President James G. Holland
closed the meeting.

“The audience at the meeting is the
chancellor of the university. When the
chancellor is not there, there is no point to

New clinic
emphasizes
preventing
depression

By Suzann Gries
News Editor

The opening of Pitt Medical Center’s
Depression and Manic—Depression
Prevention Program attracted experts
from all over the country to join in the
ribbon—cutting ceremony last Friday.

Ellen Frank, Ph.D., director of the
DMDPP, said she expects the treatment
program, which emphasizes prevention,
will save millions of dollars in health-
care costs. ,

“The future looks pretty bright, in
terms of our being able to continue the
work we set out to accomplish, and
essentially, to. find ways of adding to the
ethicacy of medications that we use to
treat manic—depressive illness, “ Frank
said.

Manic depression, or bipolar disorder,
affects one out of every 100 people over
a lifetime. Manic depressives experience
extreme mood swings ranging from

depression to euphoria, according to

Frank.

Lithium was brought to the United
States more than twenty years ago and
was thought of as the cure for manic-
depressive illness,.according to Frank.

“But the reality is that while some
patients get excellent quality of protec-
tion from new episodes, the majority of
others find themselves in the hospital
once, twice, three times,” she said.

“Even though lithium has been with us
and has been very effective for at least
twenty years or more, we’re not finished
with our research and we want to contin-
ue, and I know that is what will take
place here at Western [Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic],” said Miriam Feaster,
president of the National Depressive and
Manic—Depressive Association.

der and teaching them how to avoid

the meeting,” Tobias said.

But according to university spokesper-
son Tim Ziaukas, O’Connor had another
commitment.

“The chancellor has a very busy sched-
ule and often is required to leave meet-
ings a few minutes early to get to another
meeting. He did leave Senate Council at
4:50 p.m. to get to another meeting in the
Cathedral. Several of his appointees to
Senate Council remained,” Ziaukas said.

The meeting ended in the middle of a
report by Professor Jonathan Schooler,
chair of the Senate Student Affairs
Committee, concerning a resolution on
minority retention at Pitt. According to
Schooler, he will present his report at the
next meeting and is optimistic that the
proposal will be implemented.

“I do not believe the interruption reﬂect-
ed the merits of the proposal. My own
suspicion is that it [Tobias’ motion for
closing] reﬂected our frustration that the
chancellor had to, for likely reasons,
leave,” Schooler said.

Tobias said he thought that it was disre-

spectful that O’Connor left in the middle

of Schooler’s report.

“The chancellor cannot be everywhere
all the time, even though he does his
best,” Ziaukas said.

Also at the meeting, Graduate
Professional Student Association President
Steven Parks challenged O’Connor con-
cerning the denial to allow GPSA to raise
its student activities fee by three dollars.
But O’Connor stood firm in backing the

Womei/z’s bealtb focus of study

By Heather Fields
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh continues
its trend to. study ways to promote health
in women by participating in the
\X7omen’s Health Initiative, a nationally-
based study of women and their health.

The study will focus on how diet, hor-
mone therapy and behavior affect
women’s risks for heart disease, cancer,
and bone fractures, according to
researchers. 9

According to Dr. Arlene Caggiula,

receiving this grant has been a very posi-
tive reflection on the university. Pitt was
chosen not only for its strong track record
in the area of women’s health issues, but
also for its current studies of cardiovascu-
lar effects, bone density, dietary changes
and nutrition in post-menapausal women,
Caggiula said.

This trend in women’s health issues
began over 25 years ago when doctors at
the university began to study cancer,
especially breast cancer, and again made
a major boost in 1982 with many diverse

Turner
sues Pitt
over job
dismissal

By Julie Sabol
Editor in Chief

Former black-studies senior
lecturer Rollo Turner has filed
suit against the University of
Pittsburgh claiming he was
wrongfully terminated and that
his constitutional rights were
violated.

“I was fired for what I
believe, what I say and what I
represent,” Turner said.

Turner, who taught at Pitt for
over 20 years, said his three-
year contract covering 1990 to
1993 was breached when he
was suspended in January 1992
and subsequently fired. His suit
also claims the university vio-
lated his first amendment right
of free speech and his four-
teenth amendment right of due
process. Turner is asking for
$60,964 in damages and rein-
statement of his position.

Black-studies ‘department
Chairperson Brenda Berrian,
who suspended Turner, said
his refusal to teach a third
course in the spring term of
1992 was the reason for the
action.

Turner counters that he was
not required to teach an extra
course without receiving com-
pensation for it. He said he was
terminated for political reasons.

“I’ve always had huge enroll-
ments in my courses,” Turner
said. “I have a decent reputa-
tion as a teacher and the idea
[that] I should be fired for not
teaching one course raises cer-
tain questions. It’s a ruse for
differences between me and
ies.”

Berrian refuted allegations
that politics were involved in
the decision to fire Turner. She
said Turner failed to fulfill his
duties and responsibilities as a
professor.

“The teachers in this ‘depart-
ment have a certain number of
courses to teach,” Berrian said.
“They’re told at the beginning
of the year. Mr. Turner said no.
I have courses to teach and I
teach them. \,

“I stand clearly behind my
reasons. Politics never came
into play. Mr. Turner was sup-

he refused —— that’s all the issue
is,” Berrian said.

But Turner strongly believes
he was ﬁred because he taught
his classes from a humanist
point of view rather than an
Afrocentric point of view.

“It’s unfortunate because I felt
under the true spirit of the acad-
emic community, there should
be tolerance of differences,”
Turner said.

Teaching from an Afrocentric
viewpoint limits what students
learn, according to Turner. He
said he believes in teaching
from a broader-based view, a
humanist stance.

“I don’t share the approaches
to the politics of race many of
my colleagues do,” he said.

Turner criticizes both Pitt

. Provost Donald Henderson and

black-studies Chairperson

Brenda Berrian for the way they

handled the situation.

“Brenda Berrian immediately
attacked me when she became
chair of the department,” Turner
said. “She could not have done
what she did without the sup-

port of the administration, espe-
cially Henderson. .

“The true spirit of an academ-
ic and intellectual community
hasn’t been supported by this
administration,” he said.

‘ The university is continuing
to support Berrian’s position in
the matter.

“Essentially nothing else has
happened from the university’s
point of View since then [When
Turner left Pitt] except he’s filed
suit,” university counsel Lewis
Popper said. I

“It is the university’s policy if
a claim is brought against us
and we’re wrong we pay it and
if we’re not, we ‘don’t,” Popper
said. .

According to Turner’s lawyer,
previous attempts to resolve the
situation have failed.

“We’ve attempted to resolve it
and have not been able to, short
of a lawsuit,” Turner’s lawyer
James Gordon said.

While the university adminis-
tration does not subscribe to
Tumer’s view of the events,

228 SEMPLEST. 681-9068

some of his former colleagues
have supported his claims. I I

“Firing Rollo Turner because
he wouldn’t teach a course is a
fraudulent argument,” political-
science professor Emmanuel
Anise said. “Sooner or later the
truth will come out.”

Former black-studies
Chairperson Dennis Brutus also
supports T umer.

“Turner was suspended and
then terminated because his
philosophy and approach to
black studies and the way in
which he instructed Afro-
American students differed dras-
tically from those of [Berrianl,”
Brutus said. «

Both Anise and Brutus have
written affidavits supporting
Tumer’s case.

Turner said his firing and the
lawsuit have had many negative
consequences. His family was
forced to move because of
financial problems and his chil-
dren have dropped out of the
university.

However, he has positive

feelings about the university.

“I love the University of
Pittsburgh which I primarily see
represented by students and
colleagues which I have very
fond feelings for,” Turner said.

According to Berrian, the
black-studies department has
not suffered because of the
problems with Turner and the
law suit.

“It’s a pleasure to come to
work because it’s running so
smoothly  we’re hiring new
teachers, we’re changing our
entire curriculum, things have
turned for the better,” Berrian
said. “I’m glad I’m a part of
making this turnaround.”

Turner said he is not intimi-
dated by Pitt and considers him-
self to be fortunate to be able to
fight the university administra-
tion.

“I declared victory from the
beginning -—. there’s nothing for
me to lose,” Turner said. “I want
an opportunity to bring Pitt
before the court and let the
common people decide.”

studies on women’s health
issues, according to Dr. Lewis
Kuller, chair of epidemiology
at the School of Medicine and
principal investigator of WHI.

“This is one of the largest and
most important studies on
women and will provide
important information about
whether changing diet and the
use of medications, such as
estrogens, will decrease mortal-
ity and morbidity in women,”
Kuller said.

The University of Pittsburgh,
however, is only one of 16 clin-
ical centers leading the
Women’s Health Initiative.

In addition to the University
of Pittsburgh, other vanguard
clinical center sites such as
Brigham Women’s Hospital in
Boston, Bowman Gray Medical
Center at Wake Forest
University and the University of
Arizona will be testing the ini-
tial protocol.

Ultimately, the WHI will be at
45 cities across the nation with
about 150,000 women partici-
pating in the study.

The study is funded by a
National Institutes of Health
grant of $10.5 million.

she expects to help

“We are at a point

about prevention of

decision.

“I think the refusal to raise the
fee was a decision of Dr.
[William] Harmon [vice chancel-
lor for student affairs], and I
support him,” O’Connor said.

Parks argued that the denial to
allow GPSA to raise its student
activities fee is a form of censor-
ship. “I do not believe we are
going to get the activity fee
increase. I’m going to complain
because it is a dangerous prece-
dent — it is a form of censor-
ship,” Parks said.

But Parks said he was disap-
pointed that O’Connor did not
support the fee. “I think he’s
working out of a model that, of
course we have money because
[Student Government Board]
and [College of General Studies

Student Council] do.”

Two other members of Senate
Council, linguistics professor
Christina Bratt Paulston and
Graduate School of Public
Health student advisor Karen
Peterson, said they supported
Parks.

“The argument that I’m going
to link to this fee increase is that
the GPSA Pan-African group
does not have any space in the
union,” Parks said.

“Except for us [GPSA], there
are no graduate student organi-
zations in the William Pitt
Union. What does that mean?
That’s an argument that will
emerge this summer,” Parks
said.

In other business, Professor
Robert J. Ertel, co—chair of the
Senate Tenure and Academic

Freedom Committee, presented
the policy statement on the
awarding of tenure and univer-
sity planning which requires the
university to specifically define
the criteria for awarding tenure.
The policy was passed by the
council.

Tobias proposed a revision to
the research integrity policy,
which states that the board is
limited to investigate only spe-
cific allegations of research mis-
conduct or additional miscon-
duct that is uncovered through-
out the investigation.

The policy also states that a
formal hearing will be open to
the public unless the respon-
dent requests a closed hearing.
The revision was approved by
the Faculty Assembly and was
also passed by the Council..

Firings questionable

Last week, the associate director of athletics for 27 I
I years, Dean Billick, lost his job because it no longer

existed —— in other words, he was fired.

Billick’s position and that of John Blanton, assistant
athletic director for business and management, were
eliminated as part of a restructuring plan for the
Department of Athletics. , V

According to the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette, both Billick
and Blanton will receive severance pay for a total of
four months; two months less, mind you, than
ﬂeeting former football coach Paul Hackett and his
staff. . .

The fact of the matter is that Billick helped to turn a
struggling athletic program into a major powerhouse. 9

During his tenure, Pitt’s basketball team entered the
Big East; while Pitt became a serious contender ir1 col-
lege football.

This restructuring could be looked upon as a contra-
diction to what this university represents. The action
sends a troubling message to outsiders who see Pitt as
an employment opportunity. To fire a dedicated
individual who has bestowed 27 years of devoted ser-
vice to his community alarms even the most apathetic
of ears. ’

Nevertheless, Billick was determined to leave on a
positive note. He told The Pitt News, “I had a great 27
years at Pitt. I hope that I have given back to Pitt as
much as I got from it. Life goes on.”

That statement says a lot from a man who now may
be without a job —- well, at least here at the
university.

No one ever said that partnerships last forever, but
how do you justify such a move? And how do you
explain to a future employee of this university that no
matter how well you perform on the job, you may be
terminated in the next few years?

How many people, qualified people does the uni-
versity expect to be knocking down the door when ter-
mination is sudden and suspect?

Job security apparently cannot be expected at the
University of Pittsburgh, even for its most dedicated
and loyal employees.

And if this is any indication of job security at this uni-
versity, you’d be better off staying unemployed. Is the
university really that savage to rob a man, a
proven man, of his job, just to benefit some unseen
future?

Dean Billick left graciously —— something that most of
us can only admire and respect. He showed that even
in the midst of the storm. Who says nice guys finish
last?

White ‘males aren't so victimized

I am writing in response to
Cameron Harvey’s article on the
victimization of that most
unlucky of people, the straight
white male. “The days of the
straight, white male being in the
majority are gone.

And so are the days of unilater-
al respect,” writes Cameron.
How odd. The last time I
noticed there were only six
women in the Senate along
with 94 men. There is still only
one woman in the Supreme
Court. Women constitute only
nine percent of the representa-
tives in the United States House
of Representatives. Face it,
Cameron, white males are still
in power.

As for “being in the majority,”
white men make up 39.2 per-
cent of the United States popu-
lation, a figure that does not
constitute a majority. And as for
unilateral respect  Why would
affirmative action be necessary
if there had ever been this equal
respect for all people?

If this “unilateral respect” had
existed, then women and
minorities would have been
hired in equal proportions to
straight white men.

So don’t bemoan the death of
“unilateral respect” — it has
only begun.

Also, do not worry about
affirmative action being too
prevalent in our society,
because it is only a voluntary
statement by a company saying
that they will make some
effort to hire women and
minorities.

Since an affirmative action poli-
cy is not an actual statement of
intent, the company does not
have to abide by their affirma-
tive action policy when hiring.

Also, affirmative action is not a
quota. Actual formal quotas for
hiring are illegal as a result of
Bakke v. University of
California. _

There are only two cases
where formal quotas are
allowed: 1) where the company

. has had a blatant policy of dis-

crimination in the past and has

admitted to this and therefore
agrees to hire more women and

minorities; and 2) where the ’

company has had a blatant poli-
cy of discrimination and does
not admit to it, but still agrees to
hire more women and minori-
ties.

Both of these cases usually
only come about as a result of a
lawsuit or threat of a lawsuit.

straight white males every-

tion of power is still secure, and '

you never were the “majority.”

Confusing terms

After reading your article
“Wondering about who the vic-
tim is,” I was confused about a
few points.

First, what does “straight”
mean? Do you mean not
crooked, or do you mean het-
erosexual? I am left to assume
you mean heterosexual.

Secondly, how do you know
that 92 percent of America’s
governors are still straight,
white men and that 80 percent

of all Fortune 500 companies ‘

are straight, white men? How
do you know they are
“straight?” What source are
those statistics quoted from?
Also, are you sure that
Columbus is one of “society’s
heroes?”

Thanks for recognizing class

The Pitt News article of April
14 on the Semester-in-London
that is planned for Spring Term
1994 was a most welcome

announcement. I would like to

' point out, however, that only

one of my courses will deal
with medieval cathedrals. The
other will focus on the develop-
ment of London as one of the
great cities of the world.

Each session will take place on
a different site, tracing the
growth of the city from the time
of the Norman Conquest to the
present. ‘

The first on-site session will
be at the Tower of London, the
late 11th century -castle of
William the Conqueror.
Subsequent sessions will meet
at the docks along the
Thames, the Houses of
Parliament and Westminster
Abbey, Regent’s Park and nine
others.

The main point of this course
and that dealing with cathedrals

Tomorrow night at the
Bloomfield Bridge Tavern, the
four members of Universal
Congress Of will take the stage
and teach the audience a les-
son in mecolodics.

What is mecolodics? It’s par-
tially an approach to jazz and
partially an attitude. It’s about
taking chances and not know-
ing what will come next,
according to UCO guitarist Joe
Baiza.

The word first appeared on
Universal Congress Ofs album
This Is Mecolodics in 1988. The
album cover parodied Ornette
Coleman’s 1960 release This Is
Ou.rMu-sic.

The front cover pictured the
four Congressmen in suits,
standing exactly as the
Coleman quartet had 30 years
earlier. The liner notes gave a
band history that described
UCO as “mecolodicians” to
receive recognition as musical
innovators, again comparable
to the way Coleman pioneered
his music, later known as
“harmelodics.”

While the entire layout was
tongue in cheek, UCO was sig-
niﬁcant for another reason. The
band consisted of former punk
rockers playing jazz and play-
ing it well.

Baiza- and tenor saxophonist
Steve Moss formed Universal
Congress Of in 1987 after play-

Congressmen bring sWingin'

ing together in Saccharine
Trust. Unlike most punk bands
of the time, Saccharine’s music
merged funky jazz riffs success-
fully with spoken beat—esque
poetry. .

When the two musicians
formed their new band with
bassist Ralph Gorodetsky and
drummer Jason Kahn, they
took their jazz chops and
developed them even further.

SST Records,‘ home of punk
rock icons such as Black Flag
and Husker Du, released the
band’s debut, Prosperous and
Qualified, in 1988.

Consisting mostly of instin-
mental tunes, the album
showed the band could take on
slow blues, funk and be—bop
tempos with equal amounts of
skill. Between its own songs,
UCO boldly covered material
by. jazz guitarist James Blood
Ulmer and bluesman Willie
Dixon._

If the quartet lacked any
technical polish, it more than
made up for it in fury.A few
months later This is Mecolodics
appeared, showing greater
dimension in UCO’s musical
scope.

The band attacked the tradi-
tional “Happy Birthday” with
all the finesse of a drunk
Mariachi band marching down
a dead-end street. They also
experimented successfully with
freer jazz in a reading of
Ornette Co1eman’s “Law Years”
and Baiza’s “Joey,” a duet by

’

him and Kahn.

With chops like this, UCO
seems like the kind of band
that could appeal to a good
number of jazz listeners.
Instead, it has stayed for the
most part in the underground
scene where it began. This
often wound up creating
unusual gigs.

When UCO appeared in
Pittsburgh four years ago, it
shared a bill with the metal
band Die Kreuzen. Many audi-
ence members didn’t know

mecolodics to the BBT

what to make of the goateed
Congress members with their
funk — and synchronized leaps
in the air during songs.

The band didn’t record again
until 1991, when it released The
Sad and Tragic Demise of Salty
Blacle Wind. The album fea-
tured a new rhythm section
and a new record label. Bob
“Saccharine Trust,” Fitzer and
Paul Haines replaced
Gorodetsky and Kahn, respec-
tively.

The new lineup moved from

SST to New York’s Enemy
Records, home to such cutting-
edge jazz artists as Machine
Gun and guitarist Sonny
Sharrock. The move was a step
up for the band and its playing
improved. Baiza and Moss
sounded stronger and the new
rhythm section provided the
necessary tight backing.

Last year the band released
Eleventh Hour Shine On, which
featured yet another new
rhythm section. A.P. Gonzalez

Olivier Olivier creates impressionistic psychodrama

Members of Olivier Olivier’s Freudian family.

By Bill Kirchner

Entertainment Editor

There is something wrong with the
poster announcing the arrival of
Olivier Olivier at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse. On it, Vincent Canby tells
us that Agniezka Holland’s latest film
is “less a Freudian nightmare than
fairy tale.” I beg to differ.

Despite the skillful use of fantastic
elements she-puts into the mix, the
realism of this cinematic version of an
actual event pulled from newspaper
headlines is its focus and strength.
And as a psychological portrait, this
film is soaked in Oedipal transgres-
sion and it’s triangular variations.We
even have a disconcerting toilet scene
early in the film between little Olivier
and his mother to make sure this
angle is not out of sight.

Olivier Olivier concerns the Duval
family living in rural, provencal
France. The father Serge (Francois
Cluzet), an uncertain country veteri-
narian and his manic, doting wife
Elisabeth (Brigitte Rouan), each reveal
a deeply disturbing vulnerability in
their relations with each other and
their two children, Olivier (Gregoire
Colin) and Nadine (Marina Golovine).

When Olivier disappears after leav-
ing to take his sick grandmother some
food, perhaps the best cause for Mr
Canby’s fairy tale comment, the family
takes little time to fall apart.

Holland moves the film through the
family’s disintegration by layering one
scene on top of the other, each one

held together by a certain family
member’s peculiar way of managing
reality and the underlying cause, their
psychological Vulnerability.

Nadine turns to some magical, fan-
tasy world, and Holland gives her
intuitive and even supernatural pow-
ers.

She can shake the objects from a
shelf by merely looking at it, but this
isn’t much different from any of her
other efforts in the film. They amount
to futile disruptions stemming from a
need for attention.

Olivier Olivier could be divided into
two parts: Olivier’s disappearance and
his return six years later. Only is this
the real Olivier? Mother believes it is.
But this is what she needs. Nadine is
not so sure. And with the return of
father from Africa, the reunited family
apppears as questionable as ever.

Happiness regained is the ﬂeeting

’hope Holland dangles in front of the

Duvals, and it remains the pivot
around which she swings a darker
truth in the lurking suspense which
confronts the audience.

In the midst of all this, Holland uses
the provencal landscape in which the
Duvals reside as the canvas upon
which she paints her Freudian family.
Holland’s camera takes great care to
illuminate the rural French landscape
which inspired Van Gogh, and she
uses the countryside in her own
impressionistic fashion.

Something that provides Olivier

The new lineup moved
from SST to New York’s
Enemy Records, home to such
cutting-edge jazz artists as
Machine Gun and guitarist
Sonny Sharrock. The move
was a step up for the band
and its playing improved.
Baiza and Moss sounded
stronger and the new rhythm
section provided the neces-
sary tight backing.
~ Last year the band released
Eleventh Hour Shine On,

which featured yet another
new rhythm section. A.P.
Gonzalez joined on drums
and Steve Gaeta became the
new bassist.

While the playing still
sounded tight, the material
took a greater variety of
moods. “Mad Man Blues” fea-
tured Moss taking the spot-
light on vocals and harmoni-
ca, and he sounded like a
genuine Delta bluesman. The
group tackled John Coltrane’s
“Blues Minor” at a rapid-fire
pace. Many songs contained

extra horns and percussion to
bring out the funk even more.
And Baiza’s vocals never
contained more gritty soul
than they did on “Mad With

Pride.”

So tomorrow night the BBT
is the place to be. Be there to
feel the meco flow.

his loss of control over the fami-
ly to Africa and hislater return
are never less than tenuous. The
doubt and suspicion exist and
remain alive through Nadine and
Holland’s visual references to
the mother’s borderline sanity.

Each potential reconciliation is
countered by its unlikely possi-
bility through the entire second
half of the film. In keeping with
the psychoanalytic reading, in
this film the repression of the
past seems to always manifest
itself in the present. In the
Duvals case the effect is slowly
overwhelming.

Upstart Panthers ﬁght for playoff berth

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

Before play began in Big East
baseball this season, no one
expected much from Pitt, the
longtime doormat of the con-
ference. J

After all, how could anyone
expect anything from a -team
that sports the worst overall
conferencerecord since the Big
East started play in 1985 (30-
116 [.205D, and has never made
it to the Big East Tournament?

Pitt’s overall ineptitude in
past seasons was reflected in
the 1993 pre-season coaches
poll. Big, East coaches pegged
the Panthers to finish seventh
in the eight—team conference.

However, a select few Big
East coaches were not disillu-
sioned by Pitt’s past failures.
One example was Seton Hall’s
head coach Mike Sheppard,
who has coached such major
leaguers as Boston’s Mo
Vaughn and Houston’s» Craig
Biggio. Before this season,
Sheppard referred to the
Panthers as a “sleeping giant.”

Little did he know that the
giant would awaken this year.

The upstart Panthers have
silenced many of their critics
with a Cinderella season in ‘93,
setting new school records for
wins in a season (29) and in
Big East play (10). They have
dazzled the competition all
year with their style of run—and—
gun baseball, leading the con-
ference in hitting (.324 team
batting average), runs scored
(159) and stolen bases (62).

In 1972 under new
coach John Majors, the
Pitt football began. its rise -
from mediocrity to
national prominence.
Dean Billick was in his
eighth year as director of

. Sports Information then.

“I am most proud of 
the total rebuilding of the
football program._ In
1972, we were not in
very good shape,” Billick
said. “We had a number
of bowl games and All-
Americans, a national
championship, Heisman
trophy winner, Outland
Trophy winner and a
Lombardi Award winner.
We filled stadiums and
were on national televi-_’
sion consistently.”

In the 1980s, the Pitt
basketball program
joined the Big East and
rose to new heights, and
Billick was still a part of b
it. J ‘ l '

“The basketball pro-
gram  the entrance into
the prestigious Big East
conference, [was] some-
thing a lot of other uni-

stunning display of vast
improvement from past years
was during a three-game set
with Seton Hall this year.
Coming into this season, the
Panthers had lost 25 in a row
and 36 of 38 lifetime against
the Pirates. The last time Pitt
managed to eke out a win
against the Hall was in 1987.
Pitt hosted the Pirates for a
three-game set "in mid—April,
and not only ended the hex,
but pulled off a shocking three-

game sweep of the Pirates at
Trees Field.

Impressive_ wins against other
Big East powerhouses such as

, three-time conference champ

St. John’s and first place
Villanova have propelled this
team out of the cellar and into
serious playoff contention.
However, the Panthers have
hit a roadblock lately, as they
have stumbled to a 3-6 record
in conference play since the
sweep of Seton Hall, despite

outscoring their opposition by
nearly 20. runs.

The downslide began with an
April 24 home doubleheader
against defending Big East
champion Providence. The
Friars and Panthers pounded
out 57 runs, with Providence
taking both games, 13-11 and

L 18-15. The Panthers managed

to salvage a win in the third
game of the series, 11-10.

From there, Pitt travelled to
Boston College for an impor-

tant three-game set. Pitt annihi-

game one to the tune of 21-1.

However, BC did not let the
opening game blowout destroy
its confidence, winning the sec-
ond game of the series in 10

control the deadly Panther
offense in the final game of the
series, a 6-4 Boston College

Billick said. “We built a

which had never been
very important to Pitt.”

Panthers ’ young wheels steamroll field, at Pitt Invite

By Steve Kozarovich,
For The Pitt News

Youth was served at the Pitt
Invitational Track Meet last Saturday, as
the Pitt men’s and women’s track teams
employed blazing speed and endurance
to dominate the annual event at Pitt
Stadium.

A thrilling 4 x 400-meter relay race
highlighted the all-‘day event. First-year
students Jay Murphy, Jay Jones, Curtis
Anderson and sophomore speedster
Wes Alexander combined to win‘a nail-
biter of a race in which the lead
changed hands five times.

The members of“ that winning relay
team also did some damage on their
own during the meet. Jones, a member
of the Pitt football team, ran himself to a
first-place finish in the men’s 100-meter
dash. Murphy beat out teammate

Alexander and the rest of the competi-
tion for top honors in the men’s 110-
meter hurdles. Alexander placed third.

For Panthers’ head coach John
Vasvary, the impressive performances
by his upstart underclassmen bodes
well for the future of Pitt track.-

“We’re really looking forward to next
year,” Vasvary said. “We’ve got a lot of
young talent and our recruiting has
been going well.” '

Other standouts on the men’s team
were junior Jim Monk, who finished first
in the discus throw and second in the
shotput competition, and sophomore
Mike Umbleby, who came in second in
the men’s 1500-meters.

The theme of youthful dominance
continued in the women’s competition,
as Pitt drubbed the competition despite
the absence of All-American candidate
Allison Williams. With Williams relegat-

ed to spectator status due to tendinitis
(left knee), the Panthers thrived thanks
to a strong showing from its first- and
second—year athletes.

First—place finishes were turned in by
sophomore sprinter Staci Suggs (100-
meter hurdles), rookies Najuma Fletcher
(high jump) and Ayne Allen (400-
meters), and former All—American senior
Ronise Crumpler (800-meters).

Carmela Mariani, who last year
became Pitt’s first female runner to earn

All-American status in a distance event,»

placed second in the women’s 3000-
meters and third in the women’s 1500-
meters.

“I was very pleased with today’s
meet,” women’s track coach Steve Lewis
said. “All of our half-milers and [first-
year students] ran their personal bests
today. Except for the conference cham-
pionships, I think we had a very good

season.”

The disappointment of apoor show-
ing in the May 1-2 Big East
Championships seemed to be in the
backs of the minds of the athletes,
pushing them to perform better. The Pitt
men’s team placed fourth overall in the
league meet; the Pitt women’s squad
finished sixth.

“The 4 x 400 team ran a great race,”
Vasvary said: “Their time would have
placed them second in the Big East if
they had run it last week at the Big East
Championships.”

Several Panthers did not participate in
the meet in order to rest for the upcom-
ing IC4A championships, June 21-23 at
William and Mary, and the national
championships in June. Others used it
as a practice session and as an opportu-

nity to run in front of friends and fami— *

Pitt crew saves best

By Jack Becker

For The Pitt News

Throughout the 1992-93 sea-
son, from September to May,
one phrase echoed in the
minds of the Pitt crew team 
Dad Vail’s  Dad Vail’s  Dad
Vail’s. Coaches Rick Kelliher
and Mary Gott repeatedly ham-
mered home the notion that
the team was training not for
all the little regattas the team
would row in, but for the one
big regatta at the end.

Last Sunday, at the 55th
annual Dad Vail Regatta in
Philadelphia, _three of the five
Pitt boats present qualified for

the final heat in their respective
events, and in the end, all three
walked away from the medal
stand adorned with silver and
bronze — two silvers and one
bronze to be exact.

The crew team experienced
the best performance at the
Dad Vail Regatta in Pitt history.
All told, Pitt captured 16 total
medals in the three events (11
silver and five bronze). In years
gone by, Pitt had won only
seven total medals at the regat-
ta. So, Pitt more than doubled
its medal output in a single
year

“It’s phenomenal,” Gott said.

It appeared as if all would be
cleared up during this past
weekend when each team
would play their final Big East
three-game series.

At least, that’s how it looked.

The Panthers also appeared
to be in the most favorable
position, as they had to play a
three-game set with last place
Georgetown. As things turned
out last weekend —— with Seton
Hall sweeping BC and ‘Nova
taking two of three from the

Redmen - a Panther sweep of
the Hoyas (5-20 overall, 3-14 in
Big East) would have assured
them of a playoff spot.

However, the Hoya pitching
tandem of Sean Maloney and
John Figmic played the role of
spoiler by holding the nation’s
fifth-ranked offense to just four
runs, leading G-town to victo-
ries in the first two games of
the series, 3-1 and 4-5.

The Panther bats came alive '

in the final game with an 11-3

win. The victory put the 5

Panthers back into a fourth-
place tie — this time with BC.
The Panthers can decide their
own fate this week at Villanova
(day undetermined) and at
Connecticut on Saturday. If the
Panthers win two, they will
assure themselves of their first-
ever Big East playoff berth.

Billick

Continued from page 7
Director Oval Jaynes fired
Billick, Pitt’s associate direc-
tor of Athletics since 1983
and John Blanton, assistant
athletic director for business
and management.

Their positions were elimi-
nated in what was called the

beginning of a restructuring

of the department. According
to the press release, more
changes are coming soon.
Billick said he had no idea
the restructuring or his dis-
missal were coming. He
refused to speculate as to
why the changes were made.
“I can’t answer that,” Billick
said. “Oval called me and he
just talked about restructuring
of the department and that

my position had been elimi-
nated I am just interested on
leaving on a positive note.

“I had a great 27 years at
Pitt. I hope that I have given
back to Pitt as much as I got
from it. Life goes on.”

Jaynes was out of town
and unavailable for comment
and Carol Sprague, associate
athletic director, refused to
speak on the subject.

According to a story in the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
Billick and Blanton will
receive severance pay for
only four months, two less
than former football coach
Paul Hackett and his staff
recently received when they
were fired.

Billick refused to comment

on the issue, restating his
determination to_leave on a
positive note.

In addition to his other
positions, Billick was associ-
ate athletic director for public
affairs from 1980 to 1983.
Although he was never offi-
cially appointed to the posi-
tion, Billick also acted as
interim athletic director from
the time former AD Ed Bozik
retired until Jaynes took over.
- Blanton held his position,
dealing mostly with the ath-
letic department’s budget,
since he came to Pitt in 1978.

Although both were noti-
fied of their dismissal two
weeks ago, Billick and
Blanton will remain with the
university through Friday.
