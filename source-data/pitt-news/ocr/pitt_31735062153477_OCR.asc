Hastings and DeH art
Talk to Boys Clubs

 

Two members of Pitts champion
football team, Andy Hastings, who
came within, an ace of making an
All - Ameriéad,“ halfback position;
and Jimmy -Deﬂart, the sensational
quarter back, are setting forth
original views of bad habits
that seem to prove decidedly inter-
estihg to various high school stu-
dents. “Jimmy” and “Andy” are at
present busily engaged as Y. M. C. A.
speakers. They both have for
their themes “-Clean Living.” Add-
/1-ng great interest to their addresses
are , their illustrations from I their
college and football experience. They
are urging the boys to live, clean,

consider also that the “other fellow”
maybe more susceptible to tempta-
tion , than the-yd themselves. Both
De Hart and lllastings are interested
in club work for boys, each having
charge of a club.

In an attempt to bringlabout a
closer association of the church and
the students of the University, the
Men’s Club of the Church of the As-
cension ‘entertained the. Pitt students
last Thursday evening in the parish
house of the’ church. About 100 stu--
dents took advantage of this hospi-
tality and assisted in the workofthe
men of the church. "

The aﬁair was very informal and
no deﬁnite program was carried out.
After a. reception in the vestibule, Dr.
H. C. iwestervelt called the assembled
group into the auditorium. After so-

  =hes*1 introduced  J amesf
Wakeﬁeld‘ as the original “Sunny
Jim”, who entertained -the audience
iwith his: pithy remarks and warmed
up the boys for what was to follow.

Following another selection by the
Mandolin Club, Dr. Andrewws,-. assist-
ant rector, was introduced. Dr. An-
drews, who is a recent appointee at
the ‘church, will have charge of the
educational work of thechurch, and
will be closely associated with :,the
students. L
that he would have the hearty co-
operation of the students in his new
work; . _ I

This discourse was followed by ‘a
medley; by the Glee Club and a few
choice remarks by Dr. F. N. Thorpe,
our own professor of law. In closing
this part of the evening's entertain-
ment, Dr. Westervelt spoke on the
pleasures he had enjoyed during the.
evening, especially by the‘ fond mem-
ories brought back by the'songs of
the Glee Club. He then asked all to
;adjourn to the room on the second
ﬂoor.

Here the ladies of‘ the church had
provided .r.efreshments to which all
did ample justice. Then the essence‘
of the reception was disclosed and
discussed by Dr. Wyatt Brown, the
rector of the church, who in a few
pleasing remarks, explained that the
boy needs a home and that the/churcpﬂ
is” trying to fulﬁl its mission and pre-
.-vide'i'”for."."'thé jspiritual needs of the
students of‘? the University. '

  I8 TEBH’S GOAL

Pitt, with victories over Yale, La-
fayette and'Jun-iata, is scheduled to
meet B the Plaid ﬁve from Scheiiley
Park, who have annexed wins over
Westinghouse and the University of
Buffalo. The defeat‘ that the Car-
negie eleven suffered at the hands of
the Blue and Gold machine is still
rankling in the heartsof the Skilboes
and they arehaving fond dreams of
revenge on the basketball ﬂoor. Fri-
day night, at Trees Gym, the teams
representing the rival ‘institutions
will line up against each other at
eightthirty. . I . «, I

. The is two teams will have a number
of the same men in their lineup that
appeared with them last season. How-
ever, such men as Graham, Healey,
Qchsenhirt for ,-Pitt and Levy,

 

Tech, will be missing. The games
last year were hard fought, but the
University ‘ﬁve came out ‘on the long
end each time. The ﬁrst game ended
with Pitt in the lead 42 to 22, andthe
second game gave the Blue and Gold
.a safe margin of 17 points; Pitt 47,
Tech 30. _ ‘ A b I,
The Tech team, under the captaincy
of Hines, has been putting up a spir-
ited game. I The Westinghouse Club
has been twice defeatedand the Uni-
versity of Buffalo was the other vic-
tim. Captain Hines-is putting up one
of ‘the best games that a Tech guard
-has ever displayed, besides beinga.
close guarder,’“he is fa’ sure shot and
at shooting fouls is not far behind our
own renowned captain.
star fullback from New England, is
holding down the other guard. posi-
itioneand although not as sensational
as Hines, he is a steady and aggres-
sive player. V . .
Meredith is again holding down the
center position. He“ is a rangy chap,
but is a rather poor shot and Matson
‘should have little trouble in repeat-
ing the game. that he put up against
the Plaid team last-yeair. Tumpane,
who played on the Tech team two
years ago, is again out and is onetof
the regular -forward-s. Lewis is his
teammate, Both these men are good
shots and dangerous, if not closely
guarded, I However , there is little
likelihood that they will run wild
with Hastings and McNulty on the
' b.‘.= _ ' 2
JoThe Freshmen journey to’Slippery
Rock and ‘play the strong. Normal.
team of that place. Thisiis expected
to b‘e‘~one of the hardest games that
they will have this year and the team
has been pra ticing faithfully in or-
der to put up heir best brand of bas-
ketball. The showing they made

Iagainst Carnegie High shows that

they have struck their gait now and
should be able to clean up on the
remaining games of their schedule.
As a preliminary to the Pitt-Tech con-
test the Freshmen wil meet the Tech
Plebes. This should prove to be as
exciting as the big game. .
Considering. that both games of the
local
-schools, partisans for both sides will
be on deck in large numbers in order
to cheer their favorites on to victory.
The games and contests between the
teams of the two schools areIbecom-
ing more interesting and the enthu-
siasmtgr-eater each year. C. I. T. has
been waiting for victory to smile -on
her and it is -rumored that they think
that Friday night is _to be the lucky
date. ‘ *

 

Sprienters Commence . 4
 Active Preparation

 

The members of thetrack teanr are
busily at work preparing for the list
of meets that is to comprise the in-
door season of the Pitt schedule.
Every » Monday, Wednesday and
Thursday afternoon Coach “Andy”
Kerr is on the job. IAll of the mem-
bers of last year’s squad are likewise
much in evidence, -padding around the
big indoor track in the attempt to_.ﬁt
themselves for the initial meet which
is to be staged in the form of the
Middle Atlantic Championship, that
is to be held at the ‘Motor Square
Garden on March 4. I

The remainder of the indoor season
is possibly more important than is the
championship ‘meet,‘ for" there are
numbered among opponents of the
Blue and Gold such formidable quak-

inghouse Club. The Orange men are
to be met in Syracuse on March 12,
and on the ,10th the Westinghou.se
Club will be the opponents of the Pitt
representation.

Inasmuch as this indoor season ﬁg-
ures almost as importantly in the
track records of the University as
does that of the outdoor period the

‘men with any ..track talent hidden
away-‘intheir makeup come out on
the ‘days named above and work out
under thewatchful eye’ of Coach Kerr.

Speaking: be-flore the Pan-Ameri-

1can1VSciVentific Congress which‘ was

recently held -in “W»as;h‘ington, D. «C.,
Dr.’ Joll1nA. Blras-hear, fornzler Chan-V
cellor of the’ University declared
that if any planet was Vinllabited it
was Venus and not Mars». Dr. ‘Bra-
sllear’ said in part: “The rarity of
the atmosphere made Mars uninha-
bitable. The -at-mo’s‘p'h.ere of ‘Venus
was as dense n5’w‘55 as that. on the
earth in prehistoric’ times when life
in all forms w1as.richest,”. 5

“If it is true that the so-called ca.-5
-nals of Marsare’ 275,000 miles long,
they must be 10 miles wide. and 12
deepf’, said’ Mr. Bnash-e-ar.5 “Since
our little ditch at Panlazma cost some

$325,000,000, what a. bank account.’

The University of Pittsburgh was
well reprle-sen-ted at.,tl;le5 5 Congress.
In‘ addition to Dr. Brashealr, Pitt
was represented ’ by Chancellor

. Mo-Cormick’, Prof..R. ;Johnson; and 5,"
Prof. Morris Knowles.1 ‘ ’ 5

During the first few days of ‘the

societies met in Washington, .most
of which held joint 5 meetings’ with
various sections of the '§1ongre1ss.
This resulted in the Congress being
more successful and better ‘attended
during the early part «of its session.

The social entertainments were held
at the New National Mllseum. The
New Pan-Americ-an Union Building,
and at the.'W5ll:i"te House, Mrs. Wil-
son making her first public, appear-
ance.— V, 9 

For the -most part, the social en-
tertainment was in the Vforvm bf re-
ceptions an-d c~1onferences.. The most
important of these being the recep-
tion of the Ambassador of Chile1«wlh‘o
was the president of the Congress
and the reception tenndelle-d -to the

The men have been practicing in the

The managers of the teams in- the
local’ league have decided to run a

for the season . This will enable
those who have had little chance to
get into‘ good shape to get onto their

game during the first round and then ~

come back. in the second or . third

The ﬁrstgame in the ﬁrst“ round
will occur next Tuesday night when
