I Estelle Tran
Assistant News Editor

Glenn Alexander Stewart, Dean of the
UniversityHonors College, passedaway
yesterday atUPMC Monteﬁore Hospi-
tal.Hewas69. 1

Known as “Doc Stewart,” students
knewhimasaphysics professoraswell
as a mentor.

Stewart was one of the driving
forces behind the creation ofthe Hon-
ors College, an institution that now

has a $12 million endowment ﬁmd- '

ing undergraduate research. He is
known for giving students freedom to
research outside traditional academic

constraints. Through programs such I

as the Brackenridge Fellowship, he ad-

vocated a multidisciplinary approach

toresearch. ‘
StewartbeganhistimeatPittasan

. assistant physics professor in 1972. In

ﬁve years, he became the ﬁrst head of
the University Honors Program, which
is now the University Honors College.
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg re-
ﬂected on Stewart’s impact at Pitt.
“As the founding dean of our Uni-
versity Honors College, Alec Stewart

built one ofthe count1y’s ﬁnest honors
programs and elevatedthe qualityofthe
entire University,” Nordenberg said in
the release. ‘Alec was awarm and car-
ingperson, acommitted colleague and
giﬁedteacher, and a gracious and gentle
friend. He will be sorely missed.” _
Stewart was born onjan. 14, 1941,
in Ellensburg, Wash. He earned his

' bachelor’s degree, cum laude, in phys-

ics from Amherst College in 1962, the
release said. He earned a master’s de-
gree in physics from the University of
Washington the next year and a Mas-
ter of Science in Engineering degree

in 1965. In 1969, he attained a PhD in

solid state physics. «
AndrewRamey, aformer Bracken-_
ridge fellow, met Stewart in the Hon-
ors College while he was touring the
University as a prospective incoming
freshman.
- “He seemed really interested in
knowing who I was,” Ramey said. “I

didn’t knowhow importa_’n‘tvhewas.”‘ '

Ramey played baseball atthe time,
which intrigued the physics professor.

' “‘I-Iewas really down to earth and
really personal with students,” Ramey
said. “Docwasappropriatelyirreverent.

He’d know how to laugh and when to '

kick back.” ,
At Pitt, Stewart worked beyond his
job description. .
“whenlﬁrstgothereas afreshman
he helped me pick courses. That’s not

really his job,” Ramey said. “But Doc A

satwith me and he talkedto me about
what some good classes are.”

Ramey continued to conﬁde and
joke around with Stewart, even after
he graduated from Pitt last year and

enrolledinaPhD program atcamegie ‘'

Mellon University.

“The role he had in the Honors
College is really special. The whole in-
stitution really took shape under his
guidance.”

Ramey spent yesterday talking to
friends and reﬂecting on ﬁm times he

Deadline for voter  
registration approaches

Voter registration must be postmarked by April 19

Liz Navratil
News Editor

Pennsylvania residents have until April 19
to register to vote in May primary elec-
tions.

Students can pick up voter registra-
tion forms at the information desk in the
William Pitt Union, the libraries or any
PennDOT offices. The forms are also avail-
able in the county Elections Division (542
Forbes Ave. Room 604) or in Pitt’s Office
of Governmental Relations (701 Alumni
Hall),Jeanne Stoner, assistant vice chan-
cellor for federal government relations,
said in an e-mail.

Voters can also ﬁnd forms online at
votespa.com. They should return their
forms to the countyrElections Division.

Voter registration forms must be post-
marked by April 19. Students who have
moved, want to change their party afﬁli-
ation or have changed their name should
re-register to vote. ~

Stoner said students should think about
where they will be living on May 18, the
day of the primary elections, before they
decide where to register to vote.

Students who won’t be in Pittsburgh on
the day of the primaries but wish to vote

for city offices should re—register with
the Allegheny County Elections Division,
she said.

Students who want to vote in a county
other than the one in which they are reg-
istered can request absentee ballots.

They should contact the Office of the

Elections inlthe county in which they are‘

registered to vote either in writing or over
the phone. Students must submit their
completed absentee ballots to their county
‘elections ofﬁce by May 11, “So the request
for an application for an absentee ballot
must be submitted well in advance of that
date,” Stoner said.

Students should contact their county

’ elections office to confirm the due date

for absentee ballot applications.

A person is eligible to vote if she is 18
or older, has been a U.S; citizen for at least
one monthand has lived in Pennsylvania
and her election district for at least 30
days, Stoner said. 4

Alcohol safety programs

change with information

Simone Cheatham
Staﬁ‘Wri ter

Pitt Greensburg student Matt Tembo died
as a result of alcohol poisoning last month
on Carnegie Me1lonoUniversity’s campus.
Especially afterisomeone, like Tembo, suf-
fers an alcohol-related death, people con-

’ sider how more deaths can be prevented.

The University sponsors severa1'pro—
grams to teach students the risks of drink-
ing alcohol thatvary in approach.

Dr. Elizabeth Wettick, director of Pitt’s
Student Health, said Pitt is currently un-
dergoing a routine evaluation regarding
its alcohol programs and cannot comment
on how effective the programs are statisti-
cally. Sh-e said Pitt updates its programs
to keep up with new information and the
students. '

“We reassess and modify our program-

i ming on an ongoing and regular basis to

make sure that the information is up—to—
date, medically accurate and pertinent to

our population and its needs,” Wettick said
in an e—mail.

Dan Gittins, coordinator of Duquesne
University’s drug and alcohol awareness
program, said Duquesne follows the same
strategy and would not reevaluate its- al-
cohol program just because of a tragedy
associated with alcohol. -

“We realize there are risks to students,
andthose are the risks we’re trying to help
students avoid by employing this program,”
Gittins said. “We’re trying to address those

calculated risks to prevent students from.
’ ending up in compromising, unfortunate

situations which could very well result in
death. But we revamp our programs regu-
larly and would not reassess speciﬁcally
for student tragedy.” ,  -
Wettick said one of Pitt’s alcohol safety
programs, the Personal Education Assis-

t tance and Referral program, meets one-

and-a—half hours per week for four weeks
and serves as a sanction for students on

their first alcohol~related offense. P.E.A.R. ,

sequences of their alcohol use, understand
how alcohol affects the body, explore the

, culture of use and misuse on campus,

and evaluate their own decision making
through critical thinking.”

The program coordinates a one—on-
one meeting withthe instructor during
the ﬁnal week, which allows the teacher

to determine whether or not the student
needs more help regarding alcohol us-
age. A second course, P.E.A.R. II, follows
P.E.A.R. and consists‘ of interviews with a
substance abuse prevention specialist who
helps repeat offenders ‘determine their
levels of use and how to prevent violations
in the future. '

Pitt also offers the Greek Alcohol
Awareness program, which provides so-

rorities and fraternities with information .

about alcohol-related issues after an alco-
hol-related incident involving the group.

programs, the Party Scene and Booze Ba-

Alcohol Awareness week in October.
Wettick said Pitt’s Alcohol Task Force
implemented the three-points campaign,
a program that teaches students how to
recognize and respond to the signs of an
alcohol emergency.
Gittins said Duquesne’s DU Cares pro-
gram follows a similar four-prong ap-
proach to make students aware of alco-
hol and its effects. The first level in the
program deals with general education
awareness for students, where instruc-
tors train everyone fromfraternities and
sororities to residential assistants about
alcohol usage. Level two of the program
addresses students who violated an al-

cohol policy ‘and consists of educational . .V

classes for students during the week. Level
three involves an intervention for a repeat
offender, wherea student is advised to
make contact with local alcohol treatment

providers, and level four is the promotion .

of alcohol-free activities that are held on
campus for students. ,

“We look at our programas an educa-
tional program,” said Gittins. “We try to

‘ stress that its not meant to be punitive,

but that students can be educated without
having to be punished for alcohol viola-
tions.” ' 7 ' -

Gittins also ‘said the program does well
with students, and most students do not
have repeat violations after. their ﬁrst
mandatory educational class.  .

“It’s very effective at reducing the num- ‘

ber of problems, especially in regards to
housing violations,” Gittins said.

Gittins said DU Cares has plans to set ,

up a high school community outreach pro-

gram to prepare students for the transi- _

tion from high school to college.

“Those first few weeks in college can be
very risky and tough, especially for kids
who are not familiar with those things,”
Gittins said. “This program will help our
students learn‘ about the risks out there

and encourage them to make better deci- A _

sions for themselves.”

In spring'2009, the National" College

Health Assessment found that 40 percent
of Pitt students said they drankfour or
fewer alcoholic beverages the last time
they drank,‘and that more than 70 percent
ate before or during drinking, stayed with
a group of friends while drinking and had
.a designated driver to help reduce the
negative effects of alcohol.

7 But Wettick said students can prevent
alcohol-related injury or death by getting
help whenever they see signs of trouble;

cities include Austin, Texas, Berkeley, Calif., Phila-

“While Pittsburgh does betterthan many other

Sharrard said. “We need to continue educating
consumers about the ways to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions. That’s why events like this are so
important.”

Students representanimpo1tantpa1tofPitts—
burgh’s green movement for a host of reasons,
Heather Sage, vice presidentat local conservation
agency PennFut11re, said. '

“We’ve worked with a number of Pitt interns
over the years,” Sage said. “Their energy, open-

mindedness and enthusiasm are exactly what the
conservation movement needs in Pittsburgh.”

Inthe past college students have assisted Pen-
nEut1ire by generating podcasts, staffing policy
campaigns and writing to local newspapers and
lawmakers, she said Students have also contrib-

Sage said. “Students can also gettheir hands dirty
with the legal process and policy wor ”

Because oﬁts roots incoal and natural gaspro—
duction, southwestern Pennsylvanizfs economic

“The political process of goinggreen is goingto

Wettick said in an e—mail. “If you are with
someone who is exhibiting these signs or
any other signs that make you worry, seek

_ Gittins agreed and said using self—‘

control and common sense reduces
negative alcohol-related consequences
immensely. A

“We’re not naive. We know that under-
age students drink, but the best, simplest
advice there is for students is to keep con-

Overseas  
grading dubious
timesaver

he essay is the staple of

an American education.

No matter which ﬁeld,
technical or artistic, writing is
at the cornerstone of assessing
a student’s comprehension and
his ability to express that com-
prehension.

Grading essays becomes a bit
much, though, for a college pro-
fessor as classes often consist
of 300 or more students. Every
student produces thousands. of
words a term, which must be read
and reviewed with the same care
as those of his classmates’. Often,
to decrease the workload on the
professor’s part, teaching assis-
tants are employed or recruited.
They assist in the grading and
logistics of the course. But even
then, the work might still be too
much. '

A professor at the University
of Houston has detailed her ap-
proach to this ubiquitous predica-
ment in the Chronicle of Higher
Education. Lori Whisenant, who
teaches business law and ethics,
outsourced assignment grading
to a company whose workers
are mostly outside of the United
States. Virtual-TA, a company of
EduMetry ,Inc., aims to relieve
professors and teaching assis-
tants of the task they tradition-
ally tackle.

The workers are mostly from
Malaysia, Singapore and India
and hold advanced degrees. They
communicate with professors
via e-mail and provide detailed
feedback on assignments. The
turnaround time is short, and
assignments are handed back to
students promptly.

This solution appears to make
the education process efficient for
both professors and students. It is
a reflection of how advancements
in technology can be harnessed

for a multitude of purposes.
But how far should this effl-

. ciency be extended?

Undoubtedly there are con-
sequences of changing the tradi-
tional mechanics of education. It
is possible that third—party feed-
back on assignments will widen
the gap between an instructor
and her students. Traditional
teaching assistants are seen as
an extension of the teacher, but
virtual TAs cannot be associated
with any relevant entity in the
coursework. They are completely
external. V -

Students will inevitably have
questions on the feedback on
their assignment, and there could
be complications in communicat-
ing these questions with profes-
sors since the professors were
not the graders.

AAdditionally, traditional
teaching assistants will have less
work to do and might see a lower
amount of recruitment. These are
actual jobs that graduate students
undertake, which will effectively
be outsourced along with the as-
signments. ‘

Ultimately, though, the after-
math of employing a service like
Virtual-TA is open—ended. It’s
value may outweigh what seem
like tremendous costs, but only in
appropriate situations. It will take
time for such an arrangement to
become ingrained in the course,
such that students would perceive
it as normal. The essay is not leav-
ing anytime soon —— except by
e-mail —’ and it will always be a
part of the class structure. Will
this system make teachers more
available and produce better es-
says or will it discourage students
with indifferent grading and no
communication with the person
that grades the paper? Time will
tell. '

I am not a fan of coffee. When
my friends talk about their need
for coffee or love for Starbucks, I
proudly think about the fact that
I neither like coffee nor am I ad-

dicted. Deep down I felt it was -

good to not need caffeine to "wake
up in the morning because it was
unnatural. Still, I was slightly dis-
appointed that I didn’t like the
bitter taste of coffee because it
seemed cool to love coffee.

Not liking coffee makes it dif-
ﬁcult to meet people “for coffee.”
Questions like, “Wanna meet for
coffee” made me feel socially awk-
ward. When I did end up going
for coffee once, I ordered some
strange caffeinated creation and
didn’t like it. No big surprise. I

A girl _on my dance team really
loves Starbucks and after accom-
panying -her on runs a few times,
I thought I’d give the whole cof-
fee thing another ‘chance. This
time I tried something sweeter

that Frappuccino because it was

so sinfully delicious. It has sparse

nutritional value, it’s sugary and
it’s expensive. —-— in all other di-
mensions, it’s evil. ‘
In similar fashion to my Star-

I refuse to try deserts because I
know they’ll taste so good.
Oddly enough, desserts and
TV shows have more in common
than you might ﬁrst believe. As
soon as I started watching ‘,‘House
MD.” my addiction was instant.
I had heard my classmates talk

about “last night’s House” all the_

time, but it never really interested

‘ me. Until one fateful night: .1 ac-

cidentally ﬂipped the channel to
an episode of “House” and sadly,

I liked it — a lot. I love watch-
ing “House”‘so much I’ll give up

precious sleep and study time to ,

watch it. A few weeks ago I want-
ed to watch something to take a
break from work and my neighbor

suggested “Glee.’f I was genuinely V

scared to watch it. I knew it was
popular, plus I love dance. I had
a sinister feeling it would be my
demise. So, I didn’t watch it.
Would you say.I am a cowardly
kook or a disciplined person? Is

it good to avoid things that give
you joy because you fear you will
become enslaved to that joy? But
you -also have to remember life

"‘ yourself, even as we’re immersed

in late—night library sessions and
endless pages of reading.

So how do you reconcile the '

legitimate need to enjoy life with
the natural tendency to overin—

. dulge in those things? I try to

rationalize it by thinking I have

a ﬁnite capacity to like something.
If I consciously like onelﬂavor of
coffee or a certain TV show, I rec-
ognize a deeper desire to be able
to enjoy these things for a long
time.'Therefore, I can’t partake in
these things too much or too often

. because I’ll stop enjoying them.

But how do you know what’s too
much or too -often? Theeasiest
way I’ve found is to sacrifice
somethinggand later overindulge.

The conclusion: Don’t shy
away from the things that make
you happy. But at the same time,
do yourself a favor and control
yourself so you can continue to
enjoy the things you love. It’s a
win-win enjoying the little things
while avoiding overkill.

THEATER REVIEW

August: Osage County
Starring: Estelle Parsons,
Shannon Cochran
Benedum Center

April 6-11

$27.50-$49.75 through Pitt
Arts

If there is one theme that has

. been done to death not only in
theater, but in all mediums of-

entertainment, it’s the dysfunc-
tional family.

We all know how a messed-up
family looks, feels and sounds.
Either we are part of one or we
know someone who is. Regard-
less, watching such familiar ter-
ritory played out on stage often
seems forced at best or complete-
ly inaccurate at worst.

That’s why it is so thrilling to
see a play that not only gets it

- right but also succeeds so much

that it rises above every other
family—based drama out there.

Tracy _Lett’s Tony and Pulitzer E

award—winning play, “August:
Osage County,” will make you
do everything watching a truly
great piece of theater should:
You’ll laugh hysterically, you’ll
grip your armrest because of the

p intensity and you will walk out of

the Benedum unable to get this
f*cked-up family off your mind.

As the play opens, Beverly, the
aging alcoholic patriarch of the
Weston family, spouts off T.S. El-
iot — “This is the Way the World
Ends,” — to a young American
Indian woman he hires to keep
the house in order, but more im-
portantly, to watch over his wife,

’70s music biopic to feature rock by women

‘The Runaways’ looks to good for even actress and co—star Kristin Stuart to ruin.

    
 

Kelsey Shea
Assistant A8-E Editor

This Friday, “The Runaways,” a
long overdue rock odyssey chroni-
cling the sage of ’70s superstars
The Runaways, will ﬁnally see a
wide release after a month—long
limited release run.

Despite the fact that Kristin

_ Stewart — who sucks — stars as

Joanjett, I’m pretty excited about
the movie.

Unlike most other ’70s band
biographies, “The Runaways” will
show a different side of the rock
star lifestyle by chronicling the
rock ’n’ roll experience from the
female perspective.

The ﬁlm is based off former
Runaway lead singer Cherie Cur-

rie’s memoir about the band called -

“Neon Angel.”

The book and movie depicts the
’70s all—girl teen punk band, The
Runaways, that was in its prime
in 1976-78 and is best known for
the hits “Cherry Bomb,” “Born to
Be Bad” and “Neon Angel.” During
its reign as rock queen, the group
was big enough to headline tours
with bands like The Ramones and
Cheap Trick.

According to Currie’s book,
during its short but dramatic time
together, the band had several
members leave (including lead
singer Currie herself), romances
and hookups between band mem—
bers, kidnappings, rapes, preg-
nancies and attempted suicides.

With that much drama, it’s ac-
tually kind of amazing that it took
this long for someone to make a
movie about The Runaways.

But like most biographical
movies, certain parts are ‘drama-
tized, and others are cut. Surpris-

screenplay writer and director,
Floria Sigismondi, and the band
member caused a bit of tension

Academy Award winner Estelle Parsons,

I is a bumbling and acid-tongued pill addict

who happens to have mouth cancer. When
she is at her most intoxicated, she slurs
through words with an uncomfortably
realistic inﬂection. »

Soon, however, Beverly disappears, and
slowly the entire Weston clan — along
with peripheral husbands and fiances
— arrives, and the play really begins to
rattle the skeletons in the collective fam-
ily closet. _ 6

There’s oldest daughter’Barbara, a

 tightly wound professor who is secretly

‘middledaughter, the one who never left
‘ the small Oklahoma town. Karen is the

youngest, who obviously» missed out on
the intelligence and wit genes that so many

of the other family members constantly .

make use of. ,
Of course, there are other characters,

all of whom are totally necessary for‘the
organic progression of the play’s drama —
again, something rarely found in a piece
with such a large cast.

It’s impossible to delve any further into
the intricacies of each family member,
however, because so muchof the play’s
effect derives from the gradual unveiling
of plot points and character nuance. Who
you like in the first act will undoubtedly
change by the play’s end, which is good,
because it keeps the three—hour running

for its ﬂavor rather than price.

Gonze alsodiscourages wine drinkers

from reading bottle reviews. “I don’t buy

make that a good wine. N 0 one can tell you,
‘Oh you’re going to like this Cabernet?”

Sarah Ubinger, who graduated from,

Pitt in 2007 and has taken both Wine 101
and 102 said the classes have improved her
appreciation for wine. ‘7[Before taking the
class,] I always drank wine and knew that
I liked red more than white, but that was
the extent of what I knew about it. Now I
know it’s more complex; there’s more that
goes into choosing.”

Brian Lenz, 25, who also took Wine 101
and 102, said‘ the classes have encour-
aged him to “ask questions from people
who do know what’s on the label. If you

ask at the store. If you’re starting from

one out of the 1000 bottles in the store is

- Lenz, like Ubinger, said that before
taking the class, “I always drank wine

but didn’t know a darn thing about what
I was drinking.” He enrolled in the course

because he “just wanted to learn more.
There’s a lot to know about wine.”

Gonze says the number one goal of his
classesis “getting people comfortable with

Trouble brewing in ‘Osage County’ 

Family drama .4 14_

chran would rely on simply rais-
ing her volume for dramatic em-

~ phasis, it is evident that Cochran
packs emotional punch behind
her more scathing lines.

That leads me to the best part
of “August: Osage County” — the
script. Letts, a personal favorite
of mine since the searing “Bug,”
has an unnatural gift for writing
dialogue, and what he chooses to
include and exclude in terms of
scene and exposition results in a
near-perfect play. There are lines
in the play, especially those in
the explosive second act dinner
scene, that literally made my j aw
drop. They are incredibly harsh,
but their roots in realism — so
many characters were almost ex-
act replicas of members of my
own family — steer “August”
away from melodrama and into
grittier, more honest waters.

The set is fairly simple, with
a basic multiroom house set up
on the floor and a multistory

cross—section of the house in
the background, but it proves
an effective tool for staging and
blocking. The lighting is also ef-
fective —— though the entire set
is rarely’ dark, speciﬁc sections
of the stage are lit to show the
action of that particular scene. '
The rest of the family is always
present, and engaged, in the
shadows.

“August: Osage County” is a
show that you can’t think of how ‘
to recommend other than offer-
ing superlatives like, “It’s prob-
ably_the best play I’ve ever seen.”
It sounds exaggerated, but spend
an evening with the Weston fam-
ily, and you’ll understand what
I mean. ‘ ’

Just as every character leaves
the play unsettled and changed
— usually for the worse — you
will leave more apprehensive
than ever about the next family
gathering. »

of musical does justice  

Nowadays, Broadway and Hollywood make
strange bedfellows thanks to the trend of sub-
standard movies—turned—musicals that have
been lighting up most marquees. _ _

Luckily for the ﬁiture ofb oth entertainment
locations and their respective media, the new
revival of the classic ’70s musical “A Little, Night
Music” has gotten it right by casting Oscar win-
ner Catherine Zeta—]ones in its leading role and
assembling a brilliant cast to back her up.

The musical, set in Sweden at the turn of the

» , , /

A,

century, begins with the wise Madame Armfeldt
instructing her granddaughter Fredrika about
the waythe summer night smiles. She says that it
shows its grin to the young, the fools and the old
(who she immediately classiﬁes as herself).
Sitting in front ofher vanity, Anne Egerman,
naive wife of lawyer Fredrik and stepmother
to the angsty Henrik, trills on about how she
wishes to be glamorous like the famous ‘actress
Desiree Armfeldt. By the end of the ﬁrst act

though, she changes her tune after learning

that not only isher idol having an affair with
the husband of her friend Countess Charlotte
Magnum, but also that Desiree and Fredrik
were former lovers. _

She is only further infuriated after receiving
an invitation for a weekend visit to Madame‘
Arn1feldt’s manor. Desiree sees this as a chance
to explore the lingering feelings she has for
Fredrik, but as emotions quickly reach aboiling
point on all sides of the love triangle, nothing
really goes"as planned. _

“A Little Night Music” became one of my
favorite musicals the second that I ﬁnished
listening to the original 1973 recording. The
music is swoon—worthy and the lyrics melt on
the ear drum. This new recording maintains
the beauty of both even with its scaled—down
orchestrations.

It is also commendable for its inclusion of
several never—before—released expository mu-

‘ sic tracks and dialogue scenes. For those who
will never see the marquee at the Walter Kerr
Theatre while this show is playing there, this
disc is an incredibly satisfying surrogate for
the experience. .

As for the performances, Catherine Zeta-

Jones creates an intricate portrayal of Desiree
by curbing her exterior gutsiness with an
equally powerful interior sensitivity. Angela
Lansbury’s “Liaisons” is enough to earn her at
least another Tony Award nomination, if no
her record sixth trophy. ‘

l The near record-high temperatures aren’t
the only things making this year’s April feel
like summertime, because this new recording
of So_r1dheim’s “A Little Night Music” is worthy
of smiles in return.

The women’s softball team trav-
eled to Happy Valley on Tuesday

A and returned with both a win and.

a loss.

The Panthers (18-15) split the
double-header with the Nittany
Lions (23-11), winning the ﬁrst
game 6-3 but falling in the second
game 5-1.

“It was a full team effort in the
ﬁrst game,” Pitt Head Coach Holly
Aprile said. “We didn’t produce
that well in the second game.”

Pitt racked up 10 hits in the ﬁrst .

game, with Ashley Amistade, Holly
Stevens, Amanda Heitmeier and
Ciera Damon each getting two hits
at the plate. _
Alyssa O’Connell threw a com-

plete game, allowing four hits and '

striking out four. She picked up

the win to improve her record to
6-8.’ ’

The Panthers scored ﬁrst when
Heitmeier drove in Stevens with
a single down the right ﬁeld line
in the fourth inning. Pitt added
another run in the ﬁfth off a Damon
homerun.to left ﬁeld.

Head coach Holly Aprile:

I scored Krista Rodgers. Later in

the inning, Damon singled down
the left ﬁeld line to score Jessica
Rhodunda.

Yvette Bravo’s single to left-cen-

ter in the seventh inning drove in

Amistade and Reba Tutt, sealing
the game for the Panthers despite

“It was a full team effort in.

the first game.”

Penn State answered in the bot-

‘tom of the ﬁfth after Lauren Yao

scored on a throwing error, but
Pitt added two runs each in the
sixth and seventh inning to hold
off the Nittany Lions.

In the sixth inning, Keli Gaynor

hit a sacriﬁce ﬂy to right ﬁeld that

I ,'

two runs for the Nittany Lions in
the bottom of the inning.

Damon picked up two ‘RBIs
in the game, while Yvette Bravo,
Heitmeier and Gaynor each added
one.

In the second game, Pitt’s of-
fense stalled. It managed four

hits and one run off ‘Penn State
pitcher Lisa Akamine, who struck
out nine. '

“In the second game, we strug-
gled at the plate,” Aprile said. “The
pitcher was good. We didn’t make
adjustments.”

Cory Berliner pitched six in-
nings for the Panthers, giving up

~ six hits and striking out two. Her

record dropped to 9-5 with the
loss.

The Nittany Lions started the
scoringearly with three runs in
the ﬁrst. Ashley Griflith reached
base with a single through the left
side, then later scored on a passed

ball. Later, Shannon Hutchinson

A After strong batting in the ﬁTSt grime, Pitt only‘ managed one run in the second.

Pitt scored its only run in the
top of the seventh-, when Bravo hi‘?

In both games, Aprile was im-
pressed with the Panther defense,
especially up the middle. She said
second baseman Kristen Cheese-
brew and shortstop Niki Cognigng
performed particularly well in the
inﬁeld.

Cognigni was a part of two
double plays in the second game,
one unassisted.

The Panthers look to their next
games against Kent State today?’
and Aprile said she would like
to see more consistency at the
plate. »
“In the first game we were
[more consistent],” she said. “I
want to see us keep getting bettas
and remaining aggressive to good
pitches, not swinging wildly or get-
ting behind on the count. We want
to learn from each game.”

Evan Burgos

A few big stories popped up in sports sec-
tions around the country this week that
caught my eye. I couldn’t decide which to
write about, so I decided to write about
all three.

P No. 5 takes a hike

Next season, for the ﬁrst time in this
millennium, Donovan McNabb won’t be
the starting quarterback for the Phila-
delphia Eagles. He’s been traded to the
Washington Redskins, a team in the same
division as the Birds.

Wait, what? Did I just write that? Sounds
crazy, but it’s true. Some way, some how,
the Eagles decided that it would be a good
idea to ship the most proliﬁc play caller
in franchise history, a player who led the
team to ﬁve NFC Championships and one
Super Bowl appearance, to a team that

they are guaranteed to play twice every ‘

season. _

Most Philly fans had long since realized
that the Eagles would eventually deal Mc-
Nabb. No one thought he would be traded
to a division rival. And at being unceremo-

McNabb never got a fair shake in Phil-

past. Though Duke has plenty of
talent, this year’s outﬁt was less
athletic, played in "a weak ACC
in which they lost to N.C. State
and lacked a Naismith Player of
the Year candidate, which Duke
teams of old always had.

But they won with defense
and senior leadership. This was a
team recruited to play four years
of college basketball, and that’s
what they did. It’s a far cry from
the one-and-done culture of col-
lege hoops today. For Duke, it
was about the total body of work
sculpted over several years.

A Diike maylifibe easy to hate, “ '

champions.

“She’s ﬁinny,” he said. “That’s probably the ﬁrst

Despite her activityinsports allher life, McIn-

arrived at Pitt. The pentathlon is comprised of

_ﬁve different events completed in a single day:

6o—meterhurdles, highjump, shotput,1ongjump
and the 800-meter.

However, Mclntoshprefers the heptathlon, an
outdoor seven-part event. Overtwo days, the ath-
letes competeinthe 100 hurdles, high jump, shot
put, 200, longjump,javelin throw and 800.

Not only does McIntosh like the addition of

cess at the ECAC Indoor Championships, but she
said that one of the most important effects other
third—place ﬁnish was providing conﬁdence for
the outdoor season.

“I was proud of my third place,” she said. “I
never had an indoor season, and it was nice to

Webb was impressedwith McIntosh’s perfor-
mance as a freshman, as well as her willingness
to learn.

“She’s afastleamer, and she’s focused,’ ’he said.
“She just wants to get better; andif you tell her do
something, she’s golngto do it.”

With either the pentathlon or the heptathlon,
McIntosh said thatbythe end of tlie day “you are
bound to be tired.” That’s why with multi—events

’ the athletes are given a break of 3o—45 minutes
. between each portion.

It’s not until she wakes up on the second day
of the heptathlon, McIntosh said, that she really
feels the soreness —and then shehasto compete

By the time a multi—event wraps up with the
800, the athletes’ bodies “are pretty shot.” "

“If somebody needed me to go do another
event, I would, but it’s pretty impossible after
you just did eight events,” she said. “I get used to

how my body feels, but it’s never a very pleasant I

feeling.”

McIntosh saidthatalthough most ofthe other
athletes dread the last event, the 800, it is her
favorite. '
