PITTSBURGE-I  

Might as well turn the ole thing on
An’ hear what ,it’s got to say.

Most frequently heard tune

H on the airways today is “Bei

Mir Bist Du‘ Schoen,” which is
not as it should be, according
to Dr. Lotte O. Lohstoeter, as-
sistant professor .of modern
languages. Not that Dr. Lohs-
toeter ‘objects to the song—far
from it—but, as a German expert,
Dr. Lohstoeter ﬁnds -the phrasing
of the title slightly inappropriate.

“Bei lVlir”._Ameans “at the house
of.” The complete translation

would be “at my house you are
beautiful.” Dr. Lohstoeter won-
dered what happened to the beau-
ty when the boy and girl involved
“left the house.”

Song Titles

Trying her own hand at writing
song titles, she suggested “Fur
Mich Bist Du Schoen,” which
means “in my taste, you are beau-
tiful.” Dr. Lohstoeter thinks that
the composers shied away__ from
the more exact title because they
were afraid of the pronunciation.

On every Pitt student’s “Must”
list is the College Views and News
Program (Tuesday, 8 p. m., KQV).
Herb Rackoff, the Voice of Pitt,
snatches the latest information
from the News before it is pub-
lished. And to prove that the air
edition contains the latest, Herb
writes his ‘script from 6 to 7, re-
hearses before a dead mike from
7:30 to 8, and then gives the real
thing at 8.

Three Campuses

Only school spirit prevents us
from mentioning the fact that
Frank Gill speaks for Duquesne
and Harry Scofﬁeld, for Tech, on
the same program. As inter-
locutor, staff announcer Ernie
Neff naively asks questions for
which the college boys always
have the smartest replies. Some-
times the program seems premed-
itated.

Among the shows coming up is
a Pittsburgh Varieties program
which ,will celebrate Valentine
Day‘(Tuesday, 7:30 p. m., KDKA).
Maurice Spitalny, new music di-
rector of the station, will lead the
orchestra in sweetheart songs
from China, Italy, Harlem, Scot-
land, and England.

Concluding‘ a 200'0—mile de-

AHRGUEVNLRB QUESTION

The annual western states tour
began with a successful discussion
of the NLRB_ question at Mar-
quette university, Milwaukee,
Wis., Sunday, January 30. Carroll
college, Waukesha, Wis., was the
scene of the next day’s meeting.
Wednesday, the University repre-
sentatives travelled to Chicago
and easily overpowered the team
from Loyola. -

As a feature debate at the Uni-
versity of Missouri, Columbia, Mo.,
Thursday, they defended the pro-
position, “Resolved: That‘ col-
lective bargaining in manufactur-
ing industries should be conducted
through non-company industrial
unions.”

MARVELOUS RECEPTIONS

Winning this match with the
audience vote of 60-40, the Uni-
versity men report that their
speeches will be printed in an in-
tercollegiate debate handbook.

“The receptions tendered us
along the way were nothing short
of marvelous,” declared Stark.
“Banquets at Rotary clubs, frater-
nities, and women’s clubs kept us
speaking day and night. The gen-
eral concensus of opinions was
that we were labor experts from
eastern unions.”

“What impressed me most,” de-
clared Seigal, “was the bitter cold.
At Milwaukee it was ten below

Assumes Duties

As Administrator

By ROBERT ADAMS

Rufus H. Fitzgerald, who as-
sumed his post asprovost of
the University last Wednesday,
likes to talk with students
aboutitheir ideas. ' ‘

So much does Mr. Fitzgerald
like to talk about students that
"he is extremely reluctant to

discuss his own achievements as.

director of the School of Fine
Arts, the Iowa Memorial ‘Union,
and the student service at the
University of Iowa,lwhere he has
worked for the past 18 years.

“I like to know the reasons
why students decide on the type
of work they plan to follow,” says
Mr. Fitzgerald. “I think it’s im-
portant for the student to ﬁnd
some ﬁeld in which he,is inter-
ested, and then to get as much
fun as possible from his work.”

The new provost was chosen by
Chancellor John G. Bowman to
ﬁll the position of dean of admin-
istration, a post which has been
vacant for the past seven years.
J. Steele Gow, director of the
Falk Foundation, was the last
dean of administration at the
University." .

Since Mr. Gow’_s departure, and
the death of Samuel,-B.‘__Linhart,
former secretary» of V the. Univer-
sity, the added burden of admin-
istrative duties has fallen‘ upon

Cathedral F ulfills Attorney’ s
Dream Of -Centralized School

, By ALICE BIJNOVITZ

Galen IC. ’H‘artman, attorney,
has seen the fulﬁllment of his
dream of 1896 for a centralized
university in the Oakland district.
Twelve years before WUP was
moved from the North Side,,Mr.
Hartman sponsored the idea in
the October 26, 1896, issue of The
Pittsburgh Dispatch. I

In recognition of the fact that
the city lacked a university beﬁt-
ting its industrial development,
Mr. I-Iartman proposed a million-
dollar fund be raised.

The 42-year-old clipping indi-
cates that he intended to donate
a thousand dollars and to get a
thousandgcitizens to donate like
amounts , for the million-dollar
university.

Commenting on the location of
the University in old Allegheny
(North Side), the Dispatch article
said, “What the University needs

‘ is centralization, and the adequate

place is in some of the beautiful

suburbs of Pittsburgh. The time

for centralization -is now. 

“There are yet several well lo-
cated tracts of land in the East
End to be had at a reasonable
ﬁgure, within ‘easy reach of sev-
eral street car lines, and within
wa‘lkin*g distance of a very con-
siderable residence portion.”

Like most ambitious projects
this one took time to develop, ‘12
years to be speciﬁc. But, in,1908,
when Dr. Samuel Black McCor-
mick was chancellor, the Univer-
sity was, moved to the.Schenley
Farms district. ‘

When Dr. John G. Bowman be-
came chancellor in 1921,‘,the en-

rollment was triple that of_ a de--

cade ‘ago. Crowded into one-
fourth the space required, the
University needed buildings.

At this time, the last step in
Mr. Hartman’s plan was fulﬁlled
when Chancellor Bowman sug-
gested "the construction of a cen-
tralized school, the Cathedral of

Learning.

Comes the dawn of a new semes-
ter, a return to work, a revival of
social interest (we hope), and a
new editor for Socialitems. It is
depressing to the News staff to
learn that its editor, Dorothy
Davis, has left the campus to make
her way in the working world, and
that the social whirl must carry
on without its star reporter. Hop-
ing for your support, this embry-
onic “Patricia Pitt” will attempt
to follow in Miss Davis’ footsteps.

Heart Hop Heads

Social Calendar

With the approach of the Valen-
tine season, all the items of this
week’s social calendar are being
eclipsed by one major event, the
Heart Hop’. This traditional affair
to which the coeds escort the eds
will be renewed for the fourth
year next Friday, February 11, in
the ballroom of Hotel Schenley.

According to rumors emanating
from the committee, and veriﬁed
by large red and white hearts
posted on campus bulletin boards,
the music for the Hop will be fur-
nished by Len Ma1vern’s orches-
tra, the dance will be held from 9
to 1 o’clock, and the rooms will be
decked with crepe paper and Val-
entine trimmings.

Plans for the occasion have been
outlined by chairman Irene Ma-
roney, president of the senior
class, and Edith Bart, business
manager. They are being carried
out by several committees, includ-
ing the orchestra committee, head-
ed by Miss Maroney; guests, by
Betty Adams, Ed39, chairman;
decorations, Patricia Elmer, C40;
posters, Dorothy Davis, C39; pub-

Questionnaires
In New Survey

Association, Review
To Picture Composite
University Alumnus

Sponsored by the General
Alumni Association of the Uni-
vcrsity and by the Alumni Re-
view, a Survey of 4400 Univer-
sity alumni is now under way,
according to Don Saunders,
acting secretary.

Alumni members are request-
ed to ﬁll, without signing their
names, questionnaires which have
been mailed to them. These ques-
tions deal with jobs, ownership
of homes and automobiles, college
activities, and other phases of so-
cial positions, progress, and pref-
erence. The results will be studied
to provide material for a picture
of the composite alumnus.

The results of this survey will
be of special interest to students
of the University, because -the
alumni members will tell whether
the work they are now engaged in
bears any relationship to any
training they received in college.
Alumni members are also asked
to offer constructive suggestions
for the continued betterment: of
the University on the basis of
their experiences as students.

Already more than 800 persons
have returned their question-
naires. This ﬁgure represents 20
percent of the total sent out, and
represents alumni from all the va-
rious schools of the University.

Early competitions reveal that
alumni members read national
magazines of the higher type, and
comedy programs are the most
popular type of radio entertain-
ment.

Mr. Saunders ‘says, “The great
response to the questionnaire has
been surprising, not only to the
Alumni office, but to advertising
men, who are usually pleased
when they -get a 10 percent re-
sponse to surveys of this type.”

Mr. Fitzgerald, in his position
of provost, will act as general su-

the University.

Outstanding among his achieve-
ments at Iowa were his manage-

Players To Staff Vacancies

Keeping in line with the present national gridiron trend
of securing Sut'herland—traine<:l men as football mentors, Dr.
John B. Sutherland, who rightly enough" initiated the policy,
appointed John Michelosen and Donald Hensley, members of

last season’s varsity, to serve
of next year’s Pitt eleven.
They will ﬁll the staff vacancies

-occasioned by the resignation Fri-

day of Charles
W. Bowser and
D r. R a 1 p h

men found it

Bowser, gen-
eral agent of an
insurance company, and Dr.
Daugherty, a recent graduate of

 

Michelosen

the Pitt medical school, have
served long terms as Panther
coaches.

Captain of the Pitt varsity in
’22, Bowser served as head coach
at both Geneva and Bowdoin. Be-
tween the years of ’27 and ’29 he
acted as Sutherland’s ﬁrst assist-
ant. . He returned to the campus
in 1935 as backﬁeld coach and
when Bill Kern hiked over to

Pitt Swimmers
Outpoint F&M
In Dual Meet.

Being the only survivor in one
of the most tempestuous week-
ends in the recent Pitt athletic ex-
perience, Coach Pat Corr’s unde-
feated swimming team diked the
powerful Franklin and Marshall
natators in a dual meet Saturday
evening in the Metropolitan Club
pool, 40-35.

LEDERSTEIN STARS

All—around strength was the
point on which the Panthers gain-
ed the edge. In the matter of ﬁrst
places they were outscored, 4-5, by
the Lancaster team which won
both relay events. It was in. pick-
ing up second and third places
that the Panthers won out.

Milton Lederstein, sophomore
star of the Panther team teamed
up with Jack Marshall, an F&M
soph, to carry away the meet’s in-
dividual honors. Both scored two
victories.

Lederstein, with competition
only from teammate, Tom Locke,
won the 220 and 440-yards events.
Locke ﬁnished second in both
events. Miller beat out Pitt’s Walt

Bill Brown, Pitt’s best diver,
was given the first place points in
his event as Steve Rodnok earn-
ed a second, giving Pitt its third
event with a 1-2 ﬁnish.

Al Beacon, sophomore back-
stroker, won the 150-yard_ back-
stroke event to gain the Panthers’
other first place.

Year’s Mile-‘-Relay Team

By This

By BILL MAZEFSKY _
James H. Potts, freshman track coach, reared his head from the
Welter of schedules, bulletins, and other registration_paraphernalia to

discuss the varsity mile relay team.

The discussion was too frequently

interrupted by a‘.2.20-pound Ph’ys,Ed major who couldn’t decide be-
tween 37, a wrestling course, or 42,;a“ dancing course.

the country". Maybe they won’t

All four.o,f -the boys have some
sort of a championsh'ip.heritage to
live up to. —Ohl‘,'McKee, and Fer-
rara are sophomores, and spent
their freshman -year beating other
freshman relay teams. They
wound up their frosh activities by
capturing the freshman relay title
at the Penn Relays. These three
boys are accustomed to winning.

junior, has also winning ways
about him. An Olympic champ,
world record holder, and inevita-
ble winner of the 880, gangling
Johnny can be depended on to

However, and here Potts grew

Olson has three other relay men
who can step around the track
fast enough to. merit considera-
tion. Art Thomas, Robert Cogs-
well, and Ed Zolnoski are likely
to force a couple of thesophs back
to the sidelines. With seven, very
good men to juggle around, Olson
needs must ﬁnd another and he’ll
have two good mile relay teams.

And, according to Potts if he
waits a year maybe the present
squad of frosh will graduate -a
couple of boys who will be relay
timber. R_ight'now the freshmen
relay men are ambling around
thinking about the Penn Relay
games a couple of months hence.
They have a title to defend. ‘

So from the conversation comes
the slight impression that the mile
relay situation will not be much
of a problem for a lengthy while.

lt’s ‘Gloomy Monday’ For Panther Teams

Boxers Lose, Johnny Last, Cugers Also:-Ran.

Ringmen Make Game
Stand Against Great‘

Syracuse Outfit

Jack Schricker’s classy ﬁsticuf-
fers suﬁered their initial setback
of the current boxing season Sat-
urday to Syracuse, 51/2 to 21/2.

The Orange ﬁghters, champions
of the Eastern Intercollegiate
League, won four matches after
the Panthers boxers had spectac-
ularly taken the opening bouts.

DORANDAWINS AGAIN

Ralph Dorand, 115, in the ﬁrst
ﬁght, received the referees nod
over Heinz Voight, his Syracuse
opponent. George Tammany,
Orange extra in the 125-pound

division, hit the canvas after one-_

minute of the second round had
elapsed, when John Wargo landed
a cement-mixer right to the jaw.

In the 135—pound class Captain
Zuccar, Syracuse, outpointed Pitt’s
Captain Caruso. Fink, 155 easily
scored a technical knockout over
Ventresca, Pitt, in the latter part
of the third round. Griffiths, M165,
Syracuse, decisioned Bombe, in a
thrilling toe-to-toe battle. The 175-
pound class match resultedpin a
draw, and -the unlimited class nod
went to Duski, Syracuse, over
Luppanacci.

ORANGE AMONG BEST

Despite this setback, which ac-
cording to the record books was as
it should be, the Panthers showed
that they have a lot of good
punches behind their gloves. To
be beaten by a veteran team such
as Syracuse presented was ex-
pected for the Panthers, but the
thoroughly competent manner in
which they were able to stand-up,
spoke well for Jack Schricker’s
team.

Syracuse, tied only by Virginia,
themselves former national cham-
pions, is one of the nation’s best
ring teams.

‘ Woodruff Runs Last

In Millrose 380,
Ryden Doesn’t Qualify

Best proof that something xvent
haywire with the Pitt teams this
past week-end was the fact that
one of Pitt’s most dependable
athletes, ’Ol John Woodruff,
acknowledged to be the greatest
half—miler in the world today, ﬁn-
ished last in the 880-event of the
annual Millrose games in Madison
Square Garden, New York City.

Woodruff, running his ﬁrst race
since last August and his ﬁrst
since the removal of his tonsils in
November, found himself unable
to beat an old Jonah, the banked
boards of Madison Square Gar-
den. »

Winner of the event was Char-
ley Beetham, former Ohio State
captain and at present a member
of the New York Curb Exchange’s
team. Beethem won with a time
of 1:58.8.

Eddie Brown, NYAC, and Lou
Burns, Manhattan, ﬁnished second
and third. iWoodruff was sixth. In
previous outdoor meets, Woodruff

has..hacl little trouble in beating

all three of the men who placed.

Woodruif seems to be jinxed by
the Madison Square set-up. Last
year, he-was boxed out in the fa-
mous Millrose 600 and this year he
was boxed out in his more familiar
event.

Kenny Ryden, Pitt hurdler, who
also received an invitation to the
games, did not qualify for the
finals in his high hurdles event.

This meet was the ﬁrst of the
indoor season for the Panthers.
Saturday the entire freshman and
varsity squads will participate in
their annual University Track
House championships. A picked
squad will return to New York
tthe following week to run in the
New York A. C. games.

iNotre Dame Floormen
{Smother Pitt, 51-17,
‘As Series Ends

Irishmen do it again—51 points.

Just when the Pitt-Notre Dame
basketball series begins to look
like a bloody feud, it closes!

The Notre Dame shooters very
emphatically brought to an end
their long basketball relationship
with Pitt, by unmercifully tearing
apart Dr. Carlson’s “new” hard-
wood style of play—the “Elimina—
tion System”——51-17, before a ca-
pacity crowd at the South Bend
ﬁeld house Saturday night.

PITT RETAINS EDGE

This clash sealed the Pitt-Notre
Dame record book, leaving the
Blue and Gold still ahead by the
slight margin of one game, Pitt
having copped 11 contests to Notre
Dame’s 10. It extended the Irish
home court win ‘streak to 16 vic-
toroes, and over-weighed the Pan-
ther debit side, with 7 defeats, and
only 6 triumphs on‘the credit side.

Within two minutes the Irish
registered ﬁve points to the Pan-
ther, goose-egg. Pitt played the en-
tire _ﬁrst-half with the man-for-
defense (see other
story), when the score was, Notre
Dame 29-Pitt 9. -Then the Pitts
changed to the zone defense and
managed to slow up the Irish
bombardment, but not check it.
The Panthers had assumed the
zone defense to late. Keogan’s
lads were hot and refused to cool
off even for a moment.

TVVO GOALS

some pretty accurate flingers
themselves, sent ‘the leather
through the Irish net only twice
during the ﬁrst half. And thirteen
minutes of the game had wasted
away before the ﬁrst of the two
ﬁeld goals -came.
offense bewildered the Panthers.

Oakland passers bow low and
graciously to Notre Dame, 51-41.
(Aside: This is where the N. D.
coach and officials steal the show.)

Dictator Keogan doesn’t ask
much. No, sir, he merely de-
mands that the Blue and Gold
athletes snub the zone defense,
the defense with which the home
crew checked the Irish here last
season, and employ a man—to-
man defense. The Pitt coach
doesn’t bat an eye.

He bows to Keogan. And the
Panthers bow to the Irish. And
all the local cast, participants
and spectators, bow to the two
Irish boys ‘who lugged ’ their

whistles all the way from Indiana

The good Doctor orders -the

home for the ﬁrst part of his pre-
scription himself. But sleep
doesn’t come to releasethe deject-
ed gmentor from reviewing the
dis-game of a couple of hours ago.
Under prottest he analizes it. Sud-
denly, something clicks!

In his study Dr. Carlson puts
to paper the something that click-
ed, and tags it the “Elimination
System.” All the next week he
coaches his squad in the funda-
mentals of his new ﬂoor play cre-
ation behind locked doors. News-
papers the country over pick up
the story. Publicity for the

Where College Traditions
Arc Dcepencd

“Cornell traditions‘ were deepened and »
strengthened. Public service by members of
the faculty was offered freely, and a large
number held positions with federal, state and
local governments, acted as members of spe-
cial commissions and as technical advisors on
various projects, and in many other ways
ﬁlled important roles in shaping and admin-
istering policies of public interest.”

This expression, has come from an article
published in the January 22 issue of School
and Society (you may see a copy in the Peri-
odical Room). The article was prepared by
Archie l\I. Palmer and Raymond F. Howes of
the Cornellian Council of Cornell University,
is captioned‘ “Cornell under Livingston Far-
rand.” Dr. Farrand was president of the Uni-
versity until his retirement in June, 1937. His
administration began in the fall, 1921.

It is interesting to ﬁnd that, at some uni-
versities, an attitude of faculty participation
in public service, in “outside? employment, is
not only sanctioned, but encouraged. As mat-
ter of policy, the article indicates, Dr. Farrand
believed that faculty members became better
faculty members when their interest in their
particular ﬁelds, and in related ﬁelds, was sup-
plemented by practipal experience. A

“Dr. Farrand,” the article reads, “always
was sympathetic in his support of research,
which he recognized both as a means of dis-
covering and organizing knowledge and as a
method of enriching the content .of graduate
and undergraduate courses.”

Dr. Far-rand’s attitude in the only too recent ,

Hovde case would, no doubt, have been one of
dismay. Dr. Farrand would have asked:
“Penalize: aibrilliant member of the faculty be-
cause~l1e.par-ticipates in public welfare? Lose

a professor whose ability is such that he is.

recognized not only by his students, but by his
city and state? Dismiss a teacher becauseghe
brings credit to his University, because he
proves that intelligent government may look

‘ to the University for intelligent leaders?”

These questions Dr. Farrand would have
asked. And, by directly opposite procedure,
Dr. Farrand administered a policy that was to
make possible the statementi “Cornell tradi-
tions'..we1'_e deepened and strengthened.”

When the. principle of developing great~uni--
versities” is foremost in the minds of educators,‘

it is strange that their policies can be at such
varia'n‘ce’;_ ' ' “F 1'

“'17‘vhe-law demanded an; eye for
an eye but she asked for "only his‘
lips.” That’s what the ad said
about Penitentiary and personally
I thought it was damn decentiof
heir to be satisfied with just his
lips. She must have felt sorry for
the poor fellow, locked up in a jail
and eating nothing but bread and
water. So maybe he did shoot his
grandmother, he was sorry wasn’t
he‘? Whatmore could you ask of
a guy?

That seemed to be the central
theme of this picture which had ‘as
its locale a penitentiary, whichpis
not so bad for a locale as locales
go. And had not this particular
bit of pleansantry followed such a
hit as The Awful Truth, it might
have scored heavily as one of the

!more sophisticated comedies of the

new year. Of course as a laugh
getter it loses by comparison to
the Awful Truth but the elements
of comedy arg still there.

All in all it reminded me of the
Schenley High School Thespians
presenting The Valiant the day the
hero’s voice squeaked.

FULTON

Sonja Henie is starred at the
Fulton in Happy Landing. The
landing is far from a happy one,
and it left me with the faint sus-
picion that Sonja was not giving
us a run. for our money. After all
skating is a good thing and Sonja
make one swell skate, but it must
get awful cold on that ice. It seems
to me the little blond might add a
few sidelines—-maybe card tricks,
maybe a song and dance, maybe
even a bird imitation—anything
to lessen the monotony.

Reports have it that Darryl
Zanuck has insured Sonja’s leg for
some two hundred thousand si-
moleons.

STANLEY

“Women, what would you do if
the man you loved married an-
other woman?” That question
ﬂashed on the Stanley screen a
week ago last Friday in connection
with the picture Man Proof.

Of course, ,I’;:r1 not a woman, but
frankly the qubstion worried me.
All through the week I kept think-
ing, well what the hell would a
woman do-—a strip tease? As you
might imagine I just couldn’t wait
until Friday came around to see
what Myrna 7Lo”y would do.

In this picture, Man Proof, she
is in love with this fellow Pidgeon,
see, but, although Pidgeon. thinks
she is a nice girl and all that and
loves her like _‘a sister,, he really
has a crush on this Rosalind Rus-
sel. And Rosalind, of all things,

Well.

instead of loving Pidgeon goes for
Franchot Tone. You can see what
an awful quadrangle that makes.

Now aboutwhat Myrna does-—
she doesn’t do much of anything.
Just talks and talks and talks. All
about love. All four of them talk
and they all talk about love. Oh,
some of those speeches were beau-
tiful. They had the woman be-
hind me crying something awful,
especially. when she broke a leg

heads a stage show that’s as amus-

PENN

The Buccaneer is the first De
Mille spectacle that I found to be
anything more than a lot of wo-
men in brassieres and men in
beards riding around on horses
and yelling “Odsbodkins, I want
to see blood!”

It is really an entertaining spec-
tacle, telling the story of Jean La-
ﬁtte, the nicest bad man of them
all. Frederick March has the
starring role, but Akim Tamiroﬁf,
as usual, steals the show with his
portrayal of Dominick You, La-
ﬁtte’s henchman. When you con-
sider that the Penn has stopped
running ads you. should realize
what an eﬂfort it is, to announce
this as the best show in town.

There’s a forlorn feeling to February registration. I don’t

envy tl1e.“frcsh1nen coming in now.

. Theisky is thick with-February, smog and gloom; a wind
slides aroundja corner and catches the hat‘-of the professor com-
lug,-up the walk to the Cathcd-ral_door. He grabs at it with one

ha',11d,-misses, chases bald-‘headed

after it. Five students come in

after him, frowning and intent and with schedules in their

hands. No smiles. No cheer.

Another professor sits at atlable and yawns. The man next

to him tries to make out a fresh-9

man’s schedule, and swears lin-
audibly at the pen the'y’ve' given
him. The ink isn’t so good,
either. . E

About eleven o’clock it begins
to -pick up. ‘ More students crowd
in. Theseniors forget where
they’re supposed to go, and run
from one aide to the other; the
freshmen keep their scared eyes
glued on the signs and arrows and
get through with a minimum bf
trouble.

Some of the _boys checking
cards get bored. They write on
the card on their table——“This
table for women only. Men go to
table opposite to have cards
checked.” The boys at the oppo-
site table don’t ﬁnd out for quite
a while that they’re being ribbed

. and then they ﬁnd out . . .

to our positions on the faculty."
Please be advised that since com-

very little outside work, and that
little has been entirely in the
