Union third
floor under
renovation

Staff If/rzlfer

When students return to Pitt for the fall
semester, the third ﬂoor of the William
Pitt Union will have undergone changes
to repurpose the floor for students. A

On Monday, the University began
construction to convert the third ﬂoor of
the William Pitt Union to a “Mind, Body
and Soul Floor.” Different parts of the
floor are designed for various purposes,
including enriching the mental, physical
and spiritual areas of student life. Stu-
dent Affairs doesn’t have an exact date
for construction completion, according
to Director of Communication Shawn
Ahearn, but is aiming for the start of
fall semester. V

The room will feature quiet study
lounges, exercise facilities, including an
aerobics room, and a reﬂection room.

The floor will actualize more than a
year of collaborative efforts to create a
reﬂection room between Student Affairs
and student religious organizations,
including the Muslim Student Associa-'
tion, Hilleljewish University Center and
the Catholic Newman Club.

Risky but  DIY tattoos a creative alternative

As a tribute to her dog, Casper, Alison Sutch

a needle and ink.

herself a meaningful tattoo. _

“Itvdeﬁnitely doesn’t feel good, but it’s
tolerable for sure,” Sutch said. “For me, it’s
not as painful as a real tattoo.”

For reasons like tight budgets or the
desire to be different, young people are
changing the way they modify their bod-

instead of paying someone else to do it.

are showing up on social media and around
Pitt’s campus. These do,-it-yourself tattoos

Students to build schools in impoverished nations

Jessica Iacullo
For the Pitt News

When Caroline Koenig arrived in a Haitian
village last summer for a one—week service
trip, a woman greeted her by waving palm
branches, jumping ecstatically and running
alongside her car. The builders had arrived.

Koenig, a Pitt senior neuroscience ma-
jor and chemistry minor, spent a week in
Baie Du Mesle, Haiti, with Pitt build0n, a
service organization dedicated to running
after—school programs in U.S. schools and
building schools in impoverished coun-
tries.

“The experience was incredible, and I
think that is because we worked hand in
hand with the community,” Koenig said in
an email. “It was truly a partnership, and
for a week I felt like I was part of the Baie
Du Mesle community.”

tional nonproﬁt organization that began

impoverished areas —— started two years
ago, and according to President Camille
Falcone, a senior neuroscience major, the
club will send eight members to Nicaragua
this summer to start building another pri-
mary school.

According to its website, build0n’s
mission is “to break the cycle of poverty,
illiteracy and low expectations through
service and education.” .

Three students from Pitt, six students
from Lewis and Clark College in Oregon
and two students» from Wayne State Uni-
versity in Michigan attended last summer’s
trip to Haiti. According to Koenig, four
Haitian translators helped the students
communicate with the natives, in—country
directors from bui1dOn and a small locally
hired construction crew.

Upon arriving in Haiti, Koenig and oth-

ers on the trip were brought to a church
where a welcome ceremony took place.

after sterilizing a needle with a ﬂame and
rubbing alcohol, most people attach the
needle to a pencil to maneuver the tool
more easily. After she sterilized her skin,
Sutch drew the outline of the design she
wanted with a pen and then dipped the
needle in ink contained in a sterile con-
tainer. Poking her skin in small strokes,
she traced the design.

“Your tattoo is going to be made up of
lots of tiny dots,” she said. “It’s like a bloody
little pointillism piece.”

She said students could be tattooing
themselves to feel more in control of their

‘ bodies as well as to express creativity in a

more personal way than having a tattoo
done by someone else.

“It has deﬁnitely been around longer
than traditional tattoos, but I think it has
gained popularity alongside the whole cul-
ture of DIY,” Sutch said.

Traditional tattoos done in a shop by an
artist with a tattoo gun usually cost upward
of $60, the standard minimum for any de-
sign at most shops, with additional charges

for larger sizes, intricate detail or multiple
colors. Sutch paid $30 total for all the sup-
plies necessary to do her tattoo at home. _
9 Erin Hosﬁeld, a tattoo artist at KYK-
lops in South Side, said she thinks young
people should consider the health risks of
stick—and-poke tattoos when comparing the
cost to traditional tattoos. Hosﬁeld said
the biggest risks for infection are MRSA,
hepatitis or a staph infection, andthat even
if the surface of the skin is sterilized, there
is still great risk of dragging bacteria from
on top of the skin into the bloodstrcain with
the stick—and-poke method.
“Everybody thinks of tattoos as, ‘Oh,

they are expensive, they cost so much,”’

. Hosﬁeld said. “It is that way because you

know that you’re getting a clean service. Is
it worth an extra however many dollars for
something that youfre gonna have forever
and ever?” I

Sutch gave herself her ﬁrst tattoo, a
small black circle on her wrist, when she
was in high sch0ol.Jon Milliren, a systems
administratorand database analyst at Pitt
who has many traditional and non—tradi—
tional tattoos, also started with the at—home
technique in high school.

“Right now, the chances of survival with

man said. -

Tisherman said that replacing a patient’s
blood with the cold saline solution and sus-
pending the metabolic activity gives doctors
more time to save the patient’s life because
at lower body temperatures, cells need less

oxygen to produce energy. In an emergency, v

cooling the body down could allow attend-

VERSITY

ing doctors more time to save a patient’s life.
According to Tisherman, Dr. Peter Safar, a
critical care physician at Pitt from 1979 until
1994, started EPR research after he realized
that doctors can revive those who drown in
cold water lakes up to two hours after they
stop breathing. , ’
Safar, known as the father ofCPR and the
namesake of the Safa'r Center for Resusci-
tation Research, researched and developed
EPR more than 20 years ago. After Safar died
in 2003 at age 79, Tisherman and his team
members helped to continue his research.

Tisherman said EPR is poised to be suc-

Currently, Tisherman said he and his team
of doctors and researchers are waiting for an

professor of medicine at Pitt’s Department of
Emergency Medicine, said UPMC Presbyterian
Hospital currently has about 10 to 15 patients

each year who would be eligible for such a _ .

procedure. According to Doshi, members of
the Department of Emergency Medicine are
available to assist in the identiﬁcation of eli-
gible patients. .

“We have emergency physicians standing
on call that keep in contact with the city of
Pittsburgh and other local EMTs via radio or
telephone 24/7,” Doshi said. ,

Doshi said he believes if the procedure suc-
ceeds, it will be a triumph for both patients
and doctors. _

“Everyone of our patients is someone’s

- child,” he said. “A lot are someone’s parents,

brothers and sisters. We all went to medical
school to try to help people, and this is a really
ftmway to do it.” , ' ‘

Doshi said he believes that the success of
EPR could potentially lead to a change in the
deﬁnition of death. According to Doshi, when
people are pronounced dead, their cells are still
working, even if they have lost other vital signs.

A procedure such as EPR could resuscitate
those pronounced dead. ‘

“When a victim who has had traumatic ,

cardiac arrest arrives, they may have no pulse,

no blood pressure, but that doesn’t mean that '

all their cells are not completely viable with

’ appropriate preservation,” Doshi said.

i Raquel Forsythe, associate director of the
trauma surgery division at UPMC Presbyte-

' rian Hospital, will be one of the ﬁrst trauma

surgeons to perform EPR. Forsythe said she is

“Whenever you embark on something in

TATTOO

“You’re basically using a needle, and I
don’t think they’re very sterile,” Milliren
said. “A needle from a sewing kit isn’t as
sharp as a real tattoo needle, so there’s more
chance of actually tearing the skin as you’re
poking it in at out.”

Milliren’s at—home tattoo from high
school was just a series of dots done by
his friend. His daughter Lilly, 16, also gave
herself a tattoo with India ink on her wrist.
While Milliren said he isn’t happy about his
daughter’s tattoo being in such a visible
place, he said he couldn’t fault her for doing
something he also did at her age.

He encouraged his daughter to use her
creativity and skills to become a profes~
sional tattoo artist, advising her, “If you’re
gonna do that, you might as well make mon-
ey off it.” He also said he doesn’t think stick-
and-poke tattoos will stop being popular
anytime soon.

“I think it’s really interesting that it’s a
trend that’s getting attention right now,”
Milliren said. “As far as I know, people
have always done things like this, marked
themselves. A lot of ladies my age, in their
midforties, have that heart [tattoo] with
the arrow through it that they’ve done
themselves.”

People who go into KYKlops Tattoo in
the South Side are often looking to cover
tattoos that they’ve done themselves, at
least from Hosﬁeld’s experience. Hosﬁeld
said she discourages anyone from tattooing
themselves with the “hand—poked” method.

“But if people are going to do it, they’re
going do it anyway no matter what I say,”
she said. “If it’s.worth it to you even if you
might end up with an infection, then go
ahead.” I ' ’

frankly, I don’t think that any of the

to my newest annoyance: the recent

movies this year.

The ﬁlms “Noah” and “Son of
God” have brought theissue of in-
tertwining religion and ﬁlm to the
center of the table. It’s no surprise
why media outlets have dubbed
2014 the year for religious movies.

manifests with truth, aesthetics or
shock value. Some team in Califor-

expensive moment with religion to
bring out such apparent differences.

Movies with religious premises
are misinterpreting what a religious
agenda is, and in effect, add to the
growing issue of individuals failing
to realize that religion andﬁlm serve
two widely different agendas.

“Defensively, that was unacceptable ’

for us,” redshirt sophomorevinﬁeldler
Dylan Wolsonovich said. “Seven errors,
that’s really unacceptable for any team.”
The previous high for errors the
team had made in a single contest this
season was six against Fordham in a

performance. A . - ‘

The loss was the team’s third con-

“We lacked a lot of focus and overall
intensity for the game today,” Wolso-
novich said.

After an uneventful first inning
on both sides, second baseman Matt
Johnson made the first of Pitt’s seven
errors when his throw to first base car-
ried ﬁrst baseman Eric Hess off the
bag and allowed -the leadoff batter to
reach first base safely. Later, center

ground ball to his left, and it trickled
into right ﬁeld.

The.tworuns made the difference
in the game, highlighting Pitt’s early
steps behind the Zips (15:14, 6-3 Mid-

 American Conference‘).-W  V

 Pitt (16-16, 8,-'2_r',;fC,C) responded in
its half of the inning when freshman
catcher Caleb Parry, playing in place
_of usual starter Manny Pazos, hit ‘an

;Il{_,l_3_lI’,double down the left field line.

..  runs" with a double a little toffthe

\  of where Parry had directed, his

in left field. _ ~

The Zips evened, the score in the
third when Kris Simonton, who reached -

6‘ ‘ﬂbase and took second behind an errant

‘ pickoff throw from starting pitcher T.]. 7
Zeuch bounced off the dugout railing.
Simonton scored when the next batter,

' Billy Simon, reached base on a passed

ball that rolled to the backstop.‘ A
V Pitt was ablelto respond an inning

later when Vranka got on base after
smashing a double off the wall in left
center ﬁeld and eventually crossed the
plate because of a wild Akron pickoff
attempt.

_ The lead didn’t last, though, as the
Zips tiedthe score again after a run-
ner reached base on an error by Hess,
who failed to receive a throw at first,
and then scored on a Devan Ahart RBI
single to center. .

Jordano didn’t have an answer for
how the two meetings between the
teams could differ as much as theyidid.

“I can assure you this, as a coach-
ing staff and as a team, we prepared

completely the same, but obviously our
concentration and focus today was lack-
ing,” he said. “Akron took advantage of
our multiple mistakes. When you have
six hits and score seven runs [as Akron
did], you might as well gift wrap it for
‘em. I

A ‘The offense stopped on both sides
for three innings until Akron found its
rhythm again in the top of the eighth,
scoring three runs off reliever Adam
Dian, who had come in at the beginning
of the inning in place of Zeuch, who gave
up four runs — just one earned. Dian
could only manage to retire the first
opponent he faced and loaded the bases.

When asked what the difference was
between this time out against Akon and
the first —- an 11-8 Pitt victory March
19 — Vranka said it wasn’t anything
extraordinary.

“We just didn’t execute defensively,”
he said. ’

Redshirt senior Jon Danielczyk re-
placed Dian and faredlbetter, getting
the last two outs and allowingone hit
but no runs. .

Pitt closed the deficit by one when
Hess knocked in Vranka on an'RBI sin-
gle off Matt LaRoc'ca, the fourth and
ﬁnal pitcher to take the mound. But
the Panthers mustered no more, giv-
ing Masashi Sakamoto the victory and
Dian the loss.

Wolsonovich couldn’t explain what
has ailed him and his teammates re-
cently in -these weekday games.

“It seems like we’re takingone step
forward [and] two steps back every time
we come out,” he said. “We’re a bet-
ter team than we’re playing in these
midweeks.” I i

In the six—hour bus trip Pitt’sisoftball team
made yesterday, players took different ap—
proaches to passing the time.

Junior outﬁelder Carly Thea wanted to ’
catch up on either sleep or work — perhaps
both if the latter induced theformer. Red- ‘
shirt sophomore second baseman Maggie
Sevilla chose to start studying for her upcom- '
ing ﬁnal exams in clinical psychology and
criminology. Junior pitcher Savannah King
opted to write some of her ﬁnal paper for a
history class and study for a kinesiology test.
Other players preferred to entertain them-
selves by watching movies along the way.

But by the time the Panthers arrived in
Blacksburg, Va., for a doubleheader today
against Virginia Tech at Tech Softball Park,
they all shared the same mindset: Focus on a
simple game plan that they hope brings them .

“We just need to go out there and do our
thing in every aspect of our game — hitting,
ﬁelding and pitching,” Thea said.

Before Pitt (13-17,-4-7 ACC) even boarded
the bus, though, the players weren’t sure
what to expect from Virginia Tech (22-16,
11-6 ACC), which has won six of its last eight
games. Thea said they’ll usually go over
scouting reports the night before a game
and meet as a group before the contest starts,
but the unexpected doesn’t worry her.

“Whatever [the scouting report] is going

to be, I don’t think it’s going to be anything

we can’t handle,” Thea said. “[We] just need
to go in there and play them with intensity.”

That scouting report is likely to focus on
sophomore right-handed pitchers Maggie
Tyler and Kelly Heinz. Tyler, who leads the

_ team with 21 games started, might pitch the

opening game, slated for 4 p.m, while Heinz
could start Game 2, scheduled for 6 p.m.

lagher, also a nursing student from Philadel-
phia, said the tight-knit seniors have been
eyeing this opportunity for awhile.

“This senior class has always been talking
about, ‘When we’re seniors, we’re gonna win
nationals. We have this huge class. We can all
be leaders on the ﬁeld for the underclass—
men,”’ Gallagher said, adding that 10 of the

_ 12 starters, including the goalie, are seniors.

But Gallagher added that the seniors
didn’t begin focusing on this year’s ﬁnal, the

  Pitt Progra ConciiPresens

   

last of their college careers,‘until after the
team lost to eventual nationalchampion Colo-
rado State in the quarterﬁnals of 1ast.year’s
league tournament — a contest in which Pitt"
once led 4-2.

Combining that determined, veteran I

presence with the loss of just one player to
graduation last year, both coach and players
have known they had the potential for this
unprecedented run. I‘ ‘ '
“Everybody kind of [ﬁgured] this was go-
ing to be the year,” Neft said.
And after strengthening the ranks by
bringing in eight freshmen in the offseason
and one NCAA Division I transfer, the team

set about achieving its goal of ﬁnishing the
season on top. ‘

So far, so good. I ,

“We’ve done everything as expected,”

’ Neft said.

Pitt’s regular season began in mid--Feb-
ruary with an undefeated tournament run
inCalifornia,with three of the Panthers’ four
victories coming against teams currently

p ranked in the top 16. It was the team’s best

performance ever in the annual trip west.

‘ “I’ve hadbetter players before,‘ [but] I
don’t think I’ve had a better team than this
before,” Neft, in his 17th yearinthe position,

said. “Nothing top to bottom like We’ve had -

this year.” - *
Pitt’s best ﬁnish at the end of a season in

school history is ﬁfth in 2007-2008, but that ,

team didn’t_win a league championship and
wasn’t as deep in reserve talent.

If anything has kept the team from sustain-
ing its pace, it’s been that impressive depth.
The captains say the widespread talent has

ensured that when reserves take the ﬁeld, the ~

level’of play isn’t depleted.

, “This year more than others, we sub more

than I have seen,” Sherry said. 2
- Having depth is crucial in the case of inju-

- ries, a major issue in seasons past. Playing the

same 11 ﬁeld players alongside a netrninder for

‘ an entire game hinders endurance, so it’s not
a shock that teams that win. national cham—’

pionships almost always have deep rosters,
according to the captains. -

Lia Winter, a Pittsburgh native, isjust .

one example of this depth. Thelfreshman

rnidﬁelder has scored eight goals and three '
assists — stats that amount to a team—high -

in points for a freshman — all while coming
off-the bench. And chances are that when
Winter enters the game, she’ll be substituting

- for a senior.

Not that she minds.
* ~ “I knew itwas going to be intense when we
came, but I never thought that we would have

such awinning season. It’_s amazingto be part c
of that,” she said. “Even on the sideline, it’s so .

exciting. Even when‘ I’m_not playing," there’s

I so much adrenaline}?

When she’s not playing, Winter added,
she’s taking mental notes. " '

“The best thing [about having so many
older players] is that we have someone to look
up to. It’s awesome to have role models to see
on the ﬁeld,” Winter said. “We canwatch what
they’re doing, and then weget our chance to

A go in and play, then we can try to follow in‘
. their footsteps and make all the same" plays.

and cu .3’ - _ .
For a young playertrying to ﬁnd a path,
following in the seniors’ footsteps seems like

a pretty good idea. I

age in 125 innings pitched this year, allowing
143 hits and 29 walks against 102 strikeouts.
Heinz has thrown 115 2/3 innings, posting a
4.05 ERA on 113 hits and 54 walks with 109
punchouts.

Never mind that Tyler has demonstrated
outstanding control or that Heinz has shown
the propensity to pile up strikeouts. Sevilla
is ready to hit.

“We go into these games like [we’re fac-

ing] any other pitcher,” Sevilla said. “Our
approachwill be to just see the ball and swing
hard.” -
If that’s been the approach for Sevilla and
Thea all year, there’s certainly no reason to
do anything differently. Thea leadsthe team
with a .397 batting average and .495 on-base
percentage and propelled herself to a team-
high .692 sluggingpercentage after a week
in which she went 8—for—11 with three home
runs. Sevilla, meanwhile, is second on the
team with a .295 average and leads the team
with eight home runs and 25 RBI.

Thea’s torrid week comes shortly after
Sevilla was named the ACC Player of the Week
on March 31. So although it seems like one
is trying to outdo the other lately, Sevilla

’ maintains that there’s no stated competition.

“[It’s] more of a camaraderie because we
try and pick each other up when one isn’t
doing well,” she said. “When both of us are
seeing the ball and getting hits we get excited
 because it means we are producing runs
for our pitchers.”

And that, of course, goes back to the com-
plete effort the team desires. It’s an approach
that Pitt head coach Holly Aprile emphasized
before the Panthers’ 2-0 win Sunday over
Boston College, a win that kept the team in
eighth place and in line for a bid to the ACC

Tournament.

Even King, who should start the ﬁrst
game of the twin bill, didn’t seem to mind
that she wouldn’t know her opponents’
tendencies until the night before the game.

“The biggest thing for us is to just go back
to how we were [playing] against Boston
College on Sunday,” she said. “Coach Holly
gave us a littlespeech before, a reminder
that we need to work as a team and that we

need to have each other’s backs, whether it’s
pitching, offense or defense.”
Kingwill have to ﬁgure out a way to slow A

down Hokies junior second baseman Kylie
McGoldrick, who leads the team with a . 361
average and whose eight home runs leave her
tied with senior outﬁelder Amanda Ake for
the team high.

But King added that she’ll be able to hold
up her end of the deal by keeping focused
on at “one pitch at a time” mentality. It helps
her conﬁdence, too, that she has a pair of
streaking hitters who can boost an offense,
she said.

“I think our offense has been riding a lot
on the home run. Carly and Maggie keep

stepping up, and we’ll have a few others here
and there,” King said. It’s deﬁnitely nice to
know Carly’s feeling good and doingwell, so
it helps all of us. It-’s a motivator.”

Of course, it’s also motivation that the
Panthers have just 11 conference games re-
maining after today.

“Every game is huge at this point in the
ACC,” King said. “We needed to take those
three against Boston College, and we didn’t,
so it just kind of puts a little more importance
on every other game.” I
