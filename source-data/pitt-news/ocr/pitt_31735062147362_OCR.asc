Regular Edition

Dr. Kimball Sees History,
Ecorioinics As Vital Subjects

Griﬂith, Gerhardt Win
Phillips Medal As
Honoraries Tap

Speaking before a crowd of over 800
students and faculty members at
Scholars’ Day Friday. Dr. Dexter S.
Kimball, dean of Cornell University's
College of Engineering, discussed the
future of civilization, with regard to
the solving of social and economic
problems by means of “learning and
wisdom.”

Dr, Kimball suggested that the last
60 years have brought more changes
in the course of man’s life than all the
centuries before. He said: “These
new inventions—the radio, the tele-
phone, the automobile—have brought
into existence many new callings.
Youth, to ﬁt itself for these callings,
must branch out, must embrace much
that is new and different.

“The thing neededito make men
and women of greatest usefulness is
a broader viewpoint on the world as
a whole. To this end I would suggest
the studying of ﬁrst history and then
economics, to provide background
necessary for the attainment of so-
cial and economic ideals.”

The speaker went on to say that it
has been a failing of lawmakers all
over the world that they have shown
a disappointingly low appreciation for
the facts of history and economics.
“It has often been shown,” he remark-
ed, “just what happens when the
money of a country is depreciated.
Yet the talk of inﬂation goes on and
on. Panaceas similar to the Town-
send Plan have been offered to the
public from time immemorial, yet the
people still adopt every new idea that
is proposed.

Inflation An Old Practice

“If you want to get a good back-
ground on -how inﬂation operates,” Dr.
Kimball continued, “read ‘Deprecia-
tion 6Y~ Currency’ by {Henry VIII, He
tells how inﬂation worked in the 16th
century. \i‘§he trouble is that we are
lacking in essentials of history.”

Concluding, the speaker said that
if._.the world has any ,touchSt.0.I.1eS for
its problems today, those touchstones
are history and economics. “If we are
to attain all our ideals, we must solve
these social and economic problems,
and the control must come from youth.
Unless by learning and wisdom, we
can ﬁnd a solution for these prob-
lems, we cannot make our civilization
endure."

Following Dr. Kimball’s address,
and before the tapping began, schol-
arships and awards were presented.

The orchestra under Lee M. Lock-
hart and the Men’s Glee Club quartet.
provided music for the affair.

Florence Hiller, BA38, received the
only city Panhellenic scholarship giv-
en this year, an award to a woman of
superior standing. Mrs_ Mary Ray Mc-
Kee, president of the City Panhellenic
Association, presented the scholar-
ship.

- The Phi Lambda Upsilon prize, go-
ing to the sophomore chemistry spe-
cial or chemical engineering student
with the highest standing, was award-
ed to S. Frederick Kapff, C38, by To-
bias H. Dunkelberger, graduate as-
sistant in chemistry. Membership in
the American Chemical Society
was won by John J. Griffith, C36.
Griffith and George VV. Gerhardt, "C36,
were presented with the Phillips
Medal by ,Dr_ Alexander Silverman,
professor and head of the department
of chemistry.

The Margaret Enright Memorial
Award of a .75 scholarship was made
for Theta Phi Alpha fraternity by
Helen Ignelzi. It went to Mary Adele
Ehrenfeld.

Robbins Wins $10

Richard Robbins, C36. received the
Pi Tau Phi prize of $10: for his schol-
astic improvement in the last two
years of study. This award was pre-
sented by Norman Horowitz, C36.

Jean Meyer, C36, a Latin major,
Louise Misko, C36, a Spanish major,
Margaret Chalmers, C36, 21 French
major, and David Weinberger, -C36, a
German major, received the Sigma
Kappa Phi Awards presented by Dr.
\Vhitford H. Shelton, head of the de-
partment of foreign languages.

Representing Delta Phi Epsilon fra-
ternity, Ruth Lazirovitz. C36, present-
ed its annual scholarship award to a
freshman woman, Rose Solomon, C39.

Then, in the words of Israel L. Gold-
berg, C36, chairman of the Scholars’
Day committee and presiding officer
at the ceremony, it was “time to open
the Book of the Scholars.” A repre-
sentative of each participating frater-
nity read the list of tappees for his
organization. Those tapped include-

Broadcast Fight
Fails To Bother
Ball Committee

While the downtown radio stations
are ﬁghting for the right to broadcast
the music of the Military Ball orches-
tras on the night of March 20, plans
for the “most successful University
aifair in years” go smoothly on their
way toward completion.

VVhy the radio stations should com-
pete is a puzzle to Howard Lutz, C36,
chairman of the dance. To his way of
thinking, there won’t be anybody with-
in their range to listen to the broad-
casts, anyway. They’ll all be at the
dance, themselves.

In fact, says Lutz, preparations are
belng made to accommodate upwards
of 1,500 couples, an attendance which
will set a new record for University
dances, but which is “certainly within
the realm of possibility.”

Gardner, Stern, Eddy, and Eichler,
the orchestra leaders, have been fore-
warned that the best will be expected
of them, and as the military depart-.
ment says, “Forewarned is fore-
armed.”

Favors are still held in the strictest
conﬁdence, and the only information
released thus far about them is, by
way of the Pitt News business staff,
that they were ordered from Balfour
and Co. Lutz intimated that maybe
The Pitt News would carry a descrip-
tion of them Wednesday and that
“They are not bracelets!”

“Anyway," he continued, “the men
get favors, too."

But notwithstanding all the above,
the Military Ball will still be held on
March 20 (that's Friday, you know)
on the 17th ﬂoor of the William Penn
Hotel, "Hotcha” Gardner, and Harold
Stern from out of town, and Fran
Eichler, and Carl Eddy of the local
talent will play, as tails, tuxes, and
striped uniforms mingle from 10
o’clock on. -

‘City’s» Business Shows 3

Deﬁnite Advancement

Local Trade Increases Noticeably
Despite Recent Sharp setbacks

Despite a moderate setback in busi-
ness activity in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict for the week-end March 6 and
numerous other setbacks, some of
which were severe in the last three
years, the Bureau of Business Re-
search points out that pronounced
gains have been made in business in
the recovery period.

The setback for the week of March
6 was apparent in all series included
in the general index of business ex-
cept for steel operations and originat-
ing shipments. These two indexes re-
mained practically unchanged.

On the other hand, a great decrease
was shown in the volume of trade,
this index falling from 97.0 in the
week ended February 29 to 91.9 for
the week ended March 6. The drop
was accounted for largely by the
slump in new automobile registrations,
new registrations being only about
one—fourth as numerous as in the pre-
ceding week. Department store sales
also reflected a larger than seasonal
drop, but for the past four weeks sales
were about 15 per cent greater than
in the corresponding period last year.

Dr. Root Will Discuss
Reasoning At Forum

The reasoning of the psychologist,
as opposed to that of the pure logician,
will be discussed today by Dr.  T.
Root, (lean of the Graduate School and
head of the department of psychol-
ogy. He will speak on, “The Psychol-
ogy of Reasoning” before the Psychol-
ogy Forum today at 4:30 o’clock, in
Room 308, Alumni Hall.

“The psychologist,” Dr. Root states,
“is interested in what is believed and
why the‘ particular individual in ques-
tion believe it. The logician, how-
ever, is interested in showing that the
thing believed is either true or
false. From the standpoint of the
psychologist, a perfectly erroneous be-
lief, held by the individual, is just as
important as an absolute fact.”

Two Scratch Heads, Find
Something In The Way

They may have been the pos-
sessors of the most brilliant minds
in the University, but nevertheless
two of the participants in the
Scholars’ Day ceremony Friday
forgot to return their caps.

Whether it was the absent-
mindedness that theoretically goes
with scholastic achievement, or
whether the cloth-covered bits of
pasteboard with the cute silk tas-
sels are now reposing in souvenir
collections is beside the point.

As Israel Goldberg, C36, chair-
man, says, “Please! Please return
our caps. Who ever heard of a
gown without a cap? See me at
the Pitt News office, from now on.”

Banjo Players In Demand,
Strings l'Vill Be Attached

“Wanted: one experienced ban-
joist. Applicants see Captain Don-
ald Trede1111ick in the ROTC head-
quarters in Room 1101, Cathedral,
as soon as possible.”

These words, like a distress sig-
nal, fell from the lips of the Pitt
bandmen when it was discovered
that, in order to play several
Stephen Collins Foster selections
at the annual home concert, the
aforementioned instrument is vi-
tally necessary. A survey of the
band showed no one with the abil-
ity to play the banjo.

The annual home concert is
scheduled for the Carnegie Music
Hall on Wednesday, April 29, and
the banjoist must have sufficient
practice with the band to coor-
dinate his large part with the other
instruments.

The band is also scheduled for
concerts at Schenley High school
next Friday , and at Scott High
School, North Braddock, the fol-
lowing Monday.

ﬁsh to a soda fountain clerk. Also,
there will be plenty of cartoons,
jokes, humor, and a plethora of other
similar things usually associated with
the Panther.

Among the headliners in this issue is
“A Finny Tale,” written by (Raymond
Maclntyre, C38, which is, the report
Then there is “Tomes
On My Hands,” a pedantic piece by

which has to do with the Military
Ball.

Volunteer Group
Outlines Purpose

Social Service Workers Plan For
Study, Discussion, Fellowship

A threefold purpose for the new
club for volunteer social service work-
ers was decided upon by the group

organizing committee at a meeting
Friday. The completed purpose
stands as:

1. To coordinate the social studies
with voluntary community service.

2. To act as a clearing house for
the discussion of problems encounter-
ed in the service work:

A. A study of problems in com-
munity leadership.

B. A study of general social prob-
lems and programs of social planning.

3. To foster fellowship among
those of the same interest.

Although the suggestion that the
club be an honorary fraternity was
favorably received by all those pres-
ent, the matter was not settled.

Eligibility of membership was also
discussed. If the club should be an
honorary, membership will probably
be based on the recommendation of
the settlement staff for which the
student works, length of time the vol-
unteer has worked, and the quality of
work done within that time. The list
of qualiﬁcations was not completed.

Present at the meeting besides the
committee were Miss I-Iele11 C. Bat-
trick, executive secretary of the
YVVCA; Miss Miriam R. Ephraim, di-
rector of activities of the YM-YVVI-IA;
and Dr. Harold A. Phelps, professor
of sociology.

The next meeting of the organizing
committee will be held ‘Wednesday at
2:45 o’clock in Room 119, Alumni
Hall.

Hegner To Lecture

An illustrated lecture by Frank A.
:Hegner, president of the Sewickley
Audubon Society, will feature a meet-
ing of the Business Administration
Alumni Association Wednesday eve-
ning at 8:30 o’clock in Room 1001, Ca-
thedral.

News Sponsors Poll Allowing University
Students To Participate In ‘America Speaks’

Beginning today, students at the
University will be given an opportun-
ity to express their views on national
political issues. The medium will be
weekly polls conducted on the cam-
pus under the sponsorship of The Pitt
News and the American Institute of
Public Opinion.

This week the question will be:
Are you in favor of currency inﬂa-
tion?” At present this is one of the
most bitterly contested controversial
issues before Congress. College stu-
dents, who study economics and public
ﬁnance, should have deﬁnite opinions
on this question. In many respects
the question resolves itself into
whether college students are sound
money men, like their fathers, or
whether they are intrigued by the
will-o’-the-wisp of the printing press.

Ballots for the poll will be printed
in The News today and Wednesday.

T

and ballot boxes will be placed at con-
venient places on the campus. The
results of the campus poll will appear
in The Pitt News next Monday, They
will also appear in the America Speaks
feature of the Institute of Public
Opinion. This is the first poll of this
kind to be taken on the University
campus, although similar surveys have
aready been made at many of the
major universities throughout the east-
ern part of the country.

ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF
CURRENCY INFLATION‘?

Yes No

Cl El

(Deposit in same boxes provided
for Style Show ballots.)

All that Mr. Student or Miss Student
has to do to vote in the poll is to ﬁll
out the ballot which appears with this
story and deposit it in one of the bal-
lot boxes.

The ﬁnal tally of the ballots will not,
of course, give the total opinion but
will merely give the representative
opinion on this campus on the question
of currency inﬂation.

There will be another poll taken
next week, on the question of whether
government positions should be given
to those who assist political parties or
whether they should be given to those
who make the highest marks in civil
service examinations.

Ballot boxes will be in the following
places: Alumni Hall (middle of ﬁrst
ﬂoor corridor); Thaw Hall; State
Hall; and Cathedral. There will be
two ballot boxes in the Cathedral, one
in the ﬁrst ﬂoor lobby and one outside
Room 801.

Tonight, then, is the play-oft’.
9 For the second straight year, the

championship of the Eastern Inter-
collegiate Conference is tied up tight-
er than an 1890* bustle. Last season
the Panthers wallopied V\'est Virginia
in the play-off to take their third con-
secutive title. This season, the Pitt
boys and the Tech boys (thanks to
the Mountaineers) are knit together
on top of the conference heap, each
having purled seven, and dropped
three.

This is the third time that the Carl-
son boys and Hannum’s gang line up
against each other this season. In
the ﬁrst battle, Tech pulled one of
its seasonal surprises and nosed out
the favored Panthers after a really
ﬁne la.st half rally, 34-29. Two weeks
ago the city rivals met again, this
time on the Tech ﬂoor, and it was the
Panther’s night to howl, 29-21, after
a rather poor exhibition of the cage
game by both teams.

This leaves the Techites shooting
their darnedest to sail through to their
first conference title. On the other
hand, there is the Panther cage team
trying for its fourth straight league
title.

Tech Wins 14, Loses Eight

This season has had the Tartan
people enjoying their best year since
someone over at Tech picked up a
basketball, and said, “Let’s play this
blooming game!” The records show
a conference standing of seven won,
three lost, while the entire season
shows 14 victories and eight defeats.
The Panthers go the Scotch four

better and stand with 18 triumphs
and eight going to the enemy.
In the important game tonight,

-Coach Hannum plans to stand pat on
his ﬁve cards that called the Golden
Cats the last two games. Captain
Joe Macalka, along with Billy Gibson,
are Hannum’s aces at forward. At
the center position, the coach has
two good boys to rely upon to oppose
Pitt’s Peter Noon. Fitzwilson will
no doubt get the starting job, but
Hugh Jlames, who played a mighty
ﬁne game last time, will also see ac-
tion, a good bit of it.

Babe Patt, one of the Tech’s higher
scorers, and either Cy Felser or Buz-
zy Greenberg will be at the guards for
the Tartans. Buzzy clicked in the
ﬁrst Pitt-Tech struggle for 14 points,
while Cy has been the individual star
in the Plaid’s last few games.

Regular Lineup Starts

There will be no change in Dr. Carl-
son's starters either. He will begin
with Billy Jesko and Frank Loucks
at the forwards. Pete Noon at center,
and Eddie Spotovich and Luke Rowe
are the guardmen. Of course, there
will be the usual amount of -Carlson
substitutions with everyone except
Rags Radvansky expected to be in
there.

Rags has been down with a severe
cold for a week, and it is doubtful if
he will have recovered sufficiently to
take his usual post at guard. For
the last two games, Rags has been
out of action.

The -

I Letter

Editor, The Pitt News:

Please allow me this opportunity to
attempt clariﬁcation of a few points
mentioned by members of the Student
Faculty Association on Tuesday eve-
ning during its discussion concerning
the Student Alliance’s petition for
recognition. Rather than to attempt
a reiteration of the points of policy
and constitutional by-laws of the un-
recognized Student Alliance, I wish
to make clear to the entire student
body the misrepresented points, out-
side of the literal acceptance of the
constitutional text, upon which judg-
ment of the application was based.

‘Twice throughout the discussion ref-
crence was made to the telegram sent
by the Student Alliance’s executive
board to the governor of the state. A
point raised by Mr. Nicholas question-
ed the right of the Alliance’s execu-
Izive board to send a telegram over
the name of the entire organization,
intimating action could be taken by
a majority of as few members of the
board as cared to attend the meet-
ing. In truth ﬁve members of the
board of seven attended, an affirma-
tive vote of four was necessary for
action, and a unanimous vote was
procured. By so acting, the board em-
ployed the right of a. governing group
of any organization, to plan and act
in the name of their group between
formal meetings. The other speaker,
Mr. Ayars, questioned the right of
the Alliance to sign its telegram in
such a manner that when publicized
the impression gained was that of the
University’s entire student body. May
I remind Mr. Ayars, and the student
body, that the telegram as published
bore the signature of Student Alliance
plus the name of the president. And
in addition, all the downtown pa-
pers further qualiﬁed their inserts
with descriptions of the organization,
its policies and activities.

Though these points may appear
trivial, yet no opportunity for correc-
tion has been offered.

Dr. Lanfear affirmed that previous
to the Executive Committee's hearing
with the president of Student Alli-
ance, the matter had not received SFA
attention. How, in that case, was
SFA able twice previously to reject
the Alliance's petition for recogni-
tion?

As for Mr. Strong’s signing of a pro-
perly headed petition, li11ed for signa-
tures, as what be believed to be a class
roll, may I suggest he hurry to class
and assure his instructor of his actual
attendance? Student Alliance, at all
times during its brief existence, has
attempted a straight-forward presenta-
tion of all its acts and intentions.
This bears repetition.

True, our University offers more
actual student freedom than many
similar institutions throughout the,
country. But how great is that—not
speaking quantitatively? What oppor-
tunity do we have on cam-
pus for free discussion of contro-
versial questions to the point of out-
lining a working policy by students
and following that policy as a student
group?

The problem is not one to be dis-
missed now that Student Alliance has
been. The point is not what these
student groups do and say, but the
right and permission to do and say it.
This is an issue which at our Univer-
sity, the University of Pittsburgh,
gradually is shifting from the ranks
of the “temporary” to the “perma-
11ent.”

Faculty Bowlers

Play Second Hay’
Matches Tonight

Professor Dambach’s Faculty bowl-
ing league swings into its second
week in action in the second half com-
petition this evening at the Strand
Bowling alleys,

Several changes in the rules were
made since the conclusion of the ﬁrst
half, the most important one being
that each team will compete against
each other in a two-game match in-
stead of four, and each group will
play two teams in an evening.

The schedule for this evening ﬁnds
the Rovers meeting the Administra-
tion and Education outﬁts; the Print-
ers engaging the Education and His-
tory sextets; the Business Adminis-
tration team playing the Engineer
and Administration teams; and the
VVildcats meeting the ‘History and En-
gineer groups.

As a result of the ﬁrst night’s ac-
tion, the Printers stand at the top of
the league with four victories and no
defeats. A tie exists in the second
place ﬁght with the Biz Ads and Edu-
cators deadlocked at 3 and 1. In
third position Engineers, Historians,
and Wildcats are sewed up in a 2-2
tie, while the Rovers and Administra-
tion bring up the rear.

Dr_ Franklin led the individual
scorers for the ﬁrst evening's play
with an average of 149.2 for four
games, followed by Mr. Wenzel with
a. 144.7 total and Dr. Nietz with a 144
score.

Phi Delts Win Title

For once the teacher met his master
in the student. Unfortunately for
the student and fortunately for the
teacher, it wasn't in the c.assroom.
It was on the bowling alley not long
ago, when the Phi Delta Theta
bowlers, interfraternity champs,
-downed a Faculty pin team, three
games to nothing, thus dethroning
the teachers from the strangle—hold
they have held on the bowling title for
the past few years.

Remembering that the Faculty pin-
men had eked out a one-pin victory
in last year’s titular match, the Phi
Delts, paced by Neil’ Wells, literally
burned up the alleys.

In the ﬁrst game the fraternity boys
knocked over 634 ducks to the Fac-
‘ultys’ 590, and improved in the sec-
ond fray to score 788 to 576 for their
opponents. By that time the 193.3
«champs had given up the ship, mak-
ing the third game unimportant as
far as the ﬁnal result was concern-
ed.

Wells, with a brilliant 223 in the sec-
ond game, averaged 158.6 for the trio
of games. High scorer for the teach-
ers was Ted Biddle, with an average
of 143.

H. Vvigman, R. Heckler, W. Glass-
ford, W. Groscope, and N. VVells made
up the winning combination, while
R. Seidle, J. C. Quick, C. Distelhorst.
J. LaBarthe, and T. Biddle formed the
loser's quintet.

Lambda; Phi-Phi Delta Theta lined up
for 8 o'clock, and Sigma Alpha Mu-
Phi Gamma Delta listed for 9 o'clock.

Thrce times during that dash,
Sebastian narrowly averted the

goal. Sixty-ﬁve thousand fans
and an overcrowded press box
of the ace sports commentators
in the country roared their ap-
proval as Izzy \Veinstock bump-
ed the Notre Dame safety man
to eliminate the ﬁnal obstacle in
the path of the Sharon Speed-
ster’s 46-yard touchdown run.

attempts of the demoralized Irish
attack, that ﬁlled the Stadium
air from goal to goal in the clos-
ing minutes of play, resulted in

Football Practice
Will Begin Today

Promising Grid Squad Assembles
At Stadium For Instructions

Only six lettermen and three squad
members will be absent a.t roll call to-
day, when Coach Jock Sutherland as-
sembles his football squad to open the
spring training drills in preparation
for the 1936 grid campaign.

In reviewing the past season, one
of the most promising sophomore
groups in University history stood up,
especially toward the end of the sea-
son, and seemed to say “Watch us in
1936!” No less than 22 second-year
men graced the Panther roster of 50-
odd candidates. Of that number, 10
saw enough action to earn varsity let-
ters in their ﬁrst year of competition.

Starting today, that sophomore
“beef trust” will be considered as
juniors with a full year of varsity ex-
perience under their belts and will be
out to make good their threat.

Senior candidates, including six var-
sity lettermen and twice that number
of squad candidates, will be ﬁghting
twice as hard as before to earn ﬁrst-
team berths in their ﬁnal year of com-
Petitions

As to members of the freshman
squad who move up for their first
crack at a varsity berth, a great big
question mark describes them best.
They will move through their ﬁrst
varsity maneuvers during this current
spring training session and the result
of those maneuvers depends pretty
much on just how much Pitt “sock
it to ’em” they show.

OF RICH, RIPE-BODIED TOBACCO

For twenty-ﬁve years the research staff
of The American Tobacco Company
has Worked steadily to produce a
measurably ﬁner cigarette—namely,
a cigarette having a minimum of vola-
tile components, with an improved rich-
ness of taste—“A LIGHT SMOKE.”

We believe that Lucky Strike Ciga-
rettes embody a number of genuinely
basic improvements,
improvements combine to produce a
superior cigarette—a modern ciga-
rette, a cigarette made of rich, ripe-
bodied tobaccos—A Light Smoke.

At Annual Banquet

King’s Cross!

\Vhat shall we do?
His purple crown

Is rent in two!

Out of his crown
He’s torn the gems!
He’s thrown his Sceptre
Into the Thames!
The Court is shaking
In its shoes—
King’s Cross!

‘What shall we do?
Leave him alone
For a minute or two.

Stamping and thumping feet pound-
ed out rhythm of these lines in ac-
companiment to the voices of Pan-
hellenic members at their formal ban-
quet Thursday night. Miss Theresa
Kahn, instructor in English, led the
group in a demonstration of the new
choral development. As guest speak-
er, Miss Kahn discussed the apprecia-
tion of poetry and concluded the eve-
ning’s program with this novel form
of entertainment.

Miss Thyrsa VV. Amos, dean of wo-
men, acted as toastmistress in pre-
senting Margaret Chalmers, Ed36,
president of Panhellenic; Betty Kel-
ley, C37, vice president and social
chairman; and Hermoine Rouff, G, for-
mer president of Panhellenic. Miss
Chalmers spoke about the future Pan-
hellenic organization, Miss Kelley dis-
cussed the present Council, and Miss
Rouff spoke on the Panhellenic organ-
ization of the past.

Zeta Tau Alpha was presented with
the scholarship cup by Mrs. Mary Mc-
Kee, City Panhellenic president. The
highest scholastic average of the past
two semesters was reached by this
group. Members of ZTA were pre-
sented with laurels as a mark of their
honor.

Throughout the banquet the Univer-
sity string trio played. Further music-
al offerings were given by members
of each women's fraternity, who sang
favorite songs of all the groups.

It Opens Today

In the lives of the coeds of the
University something important
will happen tomorrow. It will have
nothing to do with St. Patrick’s day
unless it might mean a gift in hon-
or of the day, and it has still less
to do with leap year.

There’s to be a temporary study
room for women opened in Room
351, Cathedral. It is furnished with
tables and chairs and is for study-
ing purposes cnly. The smoking
room on the eighth floor will still
be the place for social gatherings.

The new study room will be open
to all women until the library is
opened.

O save time—to contact more people more frequently
—to increase sales and reduce selling costs, business
more and more turns to the telephone.

New ideas for systematic coverage of markets, for more
efficient purchasing, collections, administration, are con-
stantly being devised by Bell System men as a result of
their experience with the application of Long Distance in
the business world.

Through developing new ideas to meet changing needs,
Bell System service grows

more and more valuable.
