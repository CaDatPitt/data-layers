vaccine, knows what the evalua-
tion report contains. _

The newspaper story stated that
not one of the 440,000 people who
received the vaccine.was aﬁected
by parolytic polio. Immediately,
reports ﬂooded foundation head-
quarters about chilﬂren who had
been struck by the disease, despite
the fact they had taken Salk shots.

All quantities were marked
with serial numbers and sched-
uled on IBM card which were
later sent‘ to the University of
Michigan to await reports on in-
dividuals’ progress.

According to Francis, nothing is
known about the information re-
leased by the World—Telegram. “If
