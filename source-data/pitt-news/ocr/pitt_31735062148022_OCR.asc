Students Attend
New Nationality
Room Opening

"Presentation to Include
Speeches in Commons
Room, Dance in Gym

Departing from the customary ded-
ication or cornerstone laying cere-
mony, .the Hungarian nationality
room Will be opened to students in a
ceremony Friday evening at 8
o’clock, ,Dr. Samuel C. Gomory,
chairman of the room committee, has
announced.

Six other nationality rooms have
been either dedicated or presentedl
to the University before being placed
into student use, but the Hungarian

committee will make an innovation,
when they “open“ their room, Mrs.{
Ruth Crawford Mitchell, adviser to‘,
the nationality room, has stated. 1

Following the address of dedica-5
tion and presentation which will bet
given in the Commons room, a re-‘;
ception and dance will be held in the i
Cathedral Gym. Admission to thel
dance will be by ticket only, Mrs.i
Mitchell said. }
Denes Gyorgi, professor at the In-,5
dustrial Arts school in Budapest, de- l
signed the Hungarian room. The de-
sign was chosen in a competition,‘
among Hungarian architests sponsor- 1
ed by the Hungarian Ministry of Ed- ;
ucation. 3
- “I tried to follow clearly the Mag-
yar folls ornament, the character ofl
which lies in the fact that in the
main it is quite simple, yet in cer-
tain places it is highly ornamental,”

'Gyorgi has said of the room.

Quiet dignity is expressed in the
tobacco-brown oak veneer sheathing
which walls the nationality room.
Brilliantly colored ceiling squares
decorated with Magyar folk motifs
form a dramatic contrast and intro-
duce an element of aayety, giving
the room an intense vitality.

. New Tuck Shop
Will Be Sm-o-0-o-th

Replete in the best Hollywood
style even to red linoleum inlaid
doors, a new Tuck Shop will be com-
pleted by January according to Al-
bert A. Klimcheck, University archi-
tect.

With Ivory walls to set off the
red» doors, terrazo ﬂoors, and indirect
lighting, the new eating place will
match even a Cecil B. De Mille set
or a Powers color reproduction.

Square maple tables, complete with
red leather chairs are being arrang-
ed to seat groups up to six people.

Special feature that will endear the
planner to the average “Tuck Shop

Hound” will be scientiﬁcally designed ‘

“leaning.backs”». for the chairs which,
will give added comfort. ‘

Another attraction for the “Tuck
Sh0DDe1" will be the many. alcoves,
designed to hold small groups in
more privacy. The alcoves will in-
clude red-leather cushioned seats.

The Tuck Shop addition will ac-
commodate 110 students and will
be located on the Bigelow Boulevard
side of the ground ﬂoor of the Ca-
thedral.

Lotus Flowers, Plum Trees, Gold

Dragons Decorate Chinese Room.

A
V

By Gertrude Messeroff

You’d be surprised, but all the at-
tention isn’t on saddle shoes, fresh-
men, or bustles. It isn’t even on the
book exchange, much. Crowds cpl-
lect around the spot, but a brunette
isn’t the object. Questions are asked,
but a lot of them are almost always
intelligent. The answers always are.
The commotion as I saw it was in
front of the rainbow room——the Chi-
nese nationality classroom, located
on the Fifth avenue side of the Com-
mons Room.

It seems that there is a ﬁerce gold-
en dragon, symbol of the Chinese
state, roaring from the ceiling which
frightens some pristine students.
Karl Thumm and John Faulk-
ner, who are decorating the room ex-
plained about the dragon. The gol.d-
en Chinese state in the center of the
ceiling is surrounded by exotic de-
sings and colors. Tamer dragons in
the corners are the statesmen, meek
and less golden than the state.

Brilliant lotus ﬂowers, purple plum
trees, red, blue and golden Chinese
scriptures ﬂash down from the ceil-
ing, making this room one of "the
most “liveable."_<_ . . _

Over the doorway is
proverb, “Be Humble.”  _ p H
the, blackboard is inscribed a blu_e

: a —Chinese

And. under, 

circle‘ofChinese letters. They, too,

tell a story. What seems to impress
the visitors most is the numerous
meanings and ideas the Chinese can
express in one single letter.

Dominating the whole room is the
state Conference, yvho seems even to
tame the dragon by his spiritual
strength. He is a remarkable ﬁgure,
beared and draped and with a
ﬁneness that is complimentary to
Mr. Thumm and Mr. Faulkner.

In fact, the whole room is a mast-
erpiece, an exotic, colorful atmosq,
phere. A ' i 1  

So, if you’re the most attractive
girl on the campus—and not used to
even inanimate competition—watch
your schedule next semester.

‘Movie Producer Relates Stories

By William L. Klinkenstein

Honest - to - goodness Hollywood
publicity hit the University campus
on Monday, when Jesse Lasky,
famed producer—director and talent
scout of that city, addressed a group
of gullible students at Foster Me-

i morial.

Mr. Lasky, who is sponsoring a na-
tion-wide talent hunt to ﬁnd new
stars for his radio program and
movies, spoke under the sponsorship
of the SFA Student Theater Commit-
tee, with David Tucker, C41, as chair-
man.

Complete with Cadillac and en-
tourage beﬁtting his Hollywood po--
sition, the movie man left no doubts
in the students’ minds that there is
such a series as “The Gateway to
Hollywood.”

The publicity was, however, tem-
pered with a few choice anecdotes
about Lasky discoveries. The audi-
ence was told some of the qualities

One (lav e.2;rlv last, F»3b1*11ar_v on a road “some-
where in Spain.” art treasures from tlie National
l‘rlii:—ac1'i1n and fro-ni the homes of vxealthv Madrilenos
were being transported lijv '»va_v of Valencia, and
’ 221-celozm to the border and ﬁnallfr to Gr4?ll(?Va.
Switzerland. Tliere they might be stored until an
end of the Spansli civil War would make their 
turn a safe one. _

On other lj':’)fi{lS, also oincwliere in Spain.” '
that saine day. men and women were fleeing‘ to the
border‘ and what. they hoped would be safety. They
were l'll1‘v"l"_‘a'i}1§_1' to reach a refuge before bombs from
cneniv planes cut short their journey.

The men taking the art lT1‘P?lS1li‘<3”s‘ to tlie border:
had no such need of hurry, for they, unlike thel
refugees, did not fear the planes that ﬂew past. A
nlm had been macle to the Nationalists that these
inanimate . objects of so much 1l)0I}E‘ldl"'_V and
a.cstlieti<.- value be permitted safe conduct to the
border. .

The plea was ;’1“anted-: the art treasures were
not boinhod. and the paintings reached tlieir desti-
nation undamaged. Presumably a few of the
refugees reached the French border alive.

And now our Polish painting has reached the
Polish €l’i'lllEl.’i.*?_‘w.’ in \Va.shington safely.

There must. we feel. be some metanine; in these
two stories which are so similar. Perhaps it is that
a "na't.ij'on‘1nust preserve its things of‘ cultural value

Or perhaps we can let the stories stand as com-
mentaries on that age old belief that men are only
prawns in the game of civilization and history.

Alumnus Objects
To Fighting
Editor,

The Pitt News:

While war continues on in Europe, our organization,
the Loyal Order of the Sons of Leavenworth, grows
by leaps and bounds.

Few words are needed to explain the purposes of
our magniﬁcent Order. We are against war, with no
ifs or buts added. We feel that no reason or cause
justiﬁes in any way the slaying of one of God’s chil-
dren by another.

Just what is ourplan‘? Our Order has as its banner
slogan, “If America goes to war, we go to Leaven-
wc=rth.”._

Hurry! Form your own District Cell of the Loyal
Order of the Sons of Leavenworthl Pick your cell-
mate while you may. Write now for your free mem-
bership card entitling you to all the privileges of our
future home. Write today to ask any questions you
wish about our secret shuffle, our national symbol--the
ball and chain, or any of the other practices of our 
clusive Order.

Since we are without Moscow gold or Fascist lucre
(in plain words, a broke American org‘an'ization) all
questions will be answered on post cards. After all,
the mall man may join us too!

HIGH RICHMAN, ’39,
National President,
The Loyal Order of the Sons of Leavenworth.

Ta, ta, kiddies. When bugles blow, the Loyal Or-
der of the Sons of Leauemcorth may go the way of the
late lamented Veterans of Future Wars. We suggest
that alumnus Richmau apply for some corzstructiue
work; E. I. Du Pont de Nemours might be if-zterested
in his services.-—1l‘h.e E'diz‘.or.

The Senator’s Opinions

Are Questioned
Editor,
The Pitt News:

After reading “Senator” Ziskind’s column “Common
Sense” of Monday, I have come to: the conclusion that
it should be tabbed “Common Nonsense.”

The “Senator’s” first five paragraphs area pretty
hard pill to swallow. But the sixth is indigestible.
Ziskind says, “Of course our sympathies lie with the
European democracies. They should.” This statement
is the most illogical, grotesque, horrible, and non-
sensical declaration I have ever heard. Vfhy? You
know as well as I do. —

The answer lies in Flanders Field, in the great bank-
ing houses of the United States, and in the heart of
every American mother. Why, after lending millions
to the-Allies in the first World War, after killing and
wounding thousands, and after spending the last ten
years in a depression, must America repeat the same
stucker-sapping operation on its citizen? Does Amer-
ica sympathy still lies in Europe after all this?

You and I have to be cold blooded about this. We
have got to match dollar for dollar-—-value for value.
The crisis has been reached—to repeal or not to repeal
the Embargo Act. If we repeal it and reduce the act
to a cash and carry basis, then Germany will take it
as an act of WAR.

“The Senator” states, “That is why we should insist
on cash and carry, realizing that only England and
France are able to utilize it. Thatis why, if necessity
should require it, we ought to extend credit for needed
purchases. But there is where we stop, and stop we
must.”

Here again England and France will cast America
in the “sucker role.” The remark about credit for
needed purchases is simply crazy. Why should America
pile up another war debt as she did twenty years ago?
Look at it as a business man would—-dollar for dollar.

But then the Senator says that there we should stop.
“Send no troops to Europe,” he declares. Do you think
for one moment that the nation would stop there? No! I
It would be necessary. to keep our troops in Europe in
order to safeguard our-in-vestments. And by thattime
our money is spent and our men killed in Europe
again. America has always played the sucker role.
Let’s not make the mistake a second time. i ;

Neither Team Optimistic
As Pitt, Washington Drill

Cripples Hamper
Panther Workouts

By Bert Jaffe

Pitt ’s football worries are in the
contagious stage as the \Vashing-
ton Huskies, ﬁrst opponent for the
Panthers, are none too optimistic
about their chances on Septem-
ber 30.

Minus his all senior backﬁeld of
‘Charles Newton, Jimmy Johnso1

Merle Miller, and Al Cruver, Phelan ,

will have to pin his hopes on last
year's second stringers and fresh
stars of ‘38.
‘Strong Line

Don Jones at fullback is the only

letterman returning counted upon to .
ﬁll one of the backﬁeld positions?
Charles Bechtel will be the signal‘:
caller with Bill Gleason and Deanf
at left hahef
and Joe Dubsky and Lloyd Phelps?

1‘-«lcAdams alternating

‘sharing honors  blocking back.

On the line the Huskies ﬁgure to
be almost on a par with Fordham’s
“seven blocks of granite.” Jay Mac-
Dowell, all coast end of last season,
is a ﬁxture on one side of the line
and will be teamed up with Bill
l‘v1arx at the other terminal spot.

At the tackle posts are Bying Nix-
on and Walt Yonker, both lettermen.
Ralph Emerson, Frank Garretson,

and Hardy Bird are in the ﬁght for
the right guard position vacated by
the graduation of Slivinski.

Letterman Bill Holmes, sophomore
Bill Nelson, and reserve Dick Green-
wood give the Phelan eleven a strong
trio for the left guard slot, left open
with the loss of Means, also by grad-
uation.

‘El Foldo’ Last Year

Rudy Mucha, 210 pounds of bruis-
ing “he-man,” rates the pivot slot

over Frankowski and Zemeck. Mucha 
opened last year as a fullback, but4

became number one center with less
than a week’s practice.

Boasting an experienced squad
with capable reserves, the Huskies
were considered the
coast at the beginning of last year
but did an “el foldo.”

Five games passed before Wash-E

ington chalked up a victory. Minne-
sota, U. C. L. :1... Oregon, and Cali-
fornia" gained decisions over

12-12 deadlock.

Stanford and Southern California
felt the wrath of a dismal Huskie
season losing via the foot method.

tanford lost by a ﬁeld goal, 10-7,
and Southern. Cal’s Trojans came
close to being on the absentee list of
the Rose Bowl game as the Huskies
emerged with an extra point, 7-6,
win.

Four Backs Hurt

Injuries have played havoc with
the Jungle Cats. The boys boarded
two planes yesterday at the county
airport, and the resemblance to an
emergency plane returning from the
front with crippled and wounded
was stronger than that to a football
team before the game.

Bob Thurbon, Ed Jones, Mike
Sekelas, and Tom Murphy, all back-
ﬁeld members. may be going along
for the ride. Thurbon is nursing a
bad leg and is a doubtful participant
in the Seattle battle. Jones has dif- ;
ﬁculty putting weight on his right?

NSPA Names 1939 Owl

As Excellent

Yearbook

University’s Annual
Attains First Class

Rating for Last Year

By Edgar Beigel

Today, following four months of
exceptionally favorably criticism, the
1939 Owl, for the ﬁrst time in its his-
tory, has been named “first class.”

Outstanding as a board of critical
judgment, the National Scholastic
Press Association annually applies its
critical service to college and high
school yearbooks. This year, from
687 high school entrants. and 234
college entrant.s, only nine journals
were chosen to ﬁt the critical bracket
of “excellent” or “ﬁrst class.” The

1939 Owl was among the nine, or if
ranked on a basis of 100%, the 1939!
Owl received a grade of 98%. 
Judging Methods 

Reflecting upon the diﬁiculties con-
cerned with last year’s Owl, Robert
C. Machesney, faculty adviser on pub-
lications congratulates the entire staff
for “putting out such a remarkable
yearbook after the delayed start.”

In explaining the form used by the
National Scholastic Press Association
in criticizing yearbooks, Mr. Maches-
ney pointed out that the introductory
nationality room features, as well as
the informal presentation of student
activities, received special commen-
dation.

Viehman Predicts

Harold Viehman, C39, editor of the
1939 Owl, now assistant executive
secretary of the YMCA, expressed his
congratulations to the staff that as-
sisted him, and predicted that, “with
the advantage of experience from last
year’s dilﬁculties, the 1940 Owl
should outrank the 1939 edition.”

National competition is based on
ﬁve classiﬁcations, All-American, ﬁrst,
second, third, and fourth class. The
Owl has usually received a “second
class” ranking, previous to this year.

committee will meet Friday after-

Marsh Blames England’s Attitude

For International Situation Today

A

By Jack Brady

Speaking at the ﬁrst Inquiry Forum
of the year last Monday, Benjamin
Marsh, executive secretary of the
People's Lobby, placed blame for
present international conditions on
the imperialistic tendencies of Britain
for the past three hundred years.

responsible for running the world,”
declared Marsh, “and she has to ﬁnd
some methods to get rid of her com-
petitors.”

During the war in Spain, Britain
and France backed Franco, who was
Hitler’s man, in the hope that Ger-
many would ﬁght Russia and save
them the trouble, he declared.

“Even our own president,” he as-
serted, “forced Congress, through his
control of appropriations, to violate
international law by placing an em-
bargo on shipments of ammunitions
and arms to Loyalist Spain.”

Refering to the neutrality of‘

what they have forgotten in Wash-

the greatest contribution that the
United States can make is to make
peace work. No other big country
excepting the Scandinavian countries,

“Britain believes that she alone is"

In closing, Mr. Marsh said, “Amer-
ican people are skeptical about let-
ting the democracies re-keep us out

;of war like they did the last time.
‘We are suffering under a dictator-

ship which is just as deadly as any
other of the totalitarian countries in
Europe.”

The Pitt News
‘Seeing Eye’ Dog Acts
As Aid to Transfer Student

By Freda Jaffe

Two inseparable friends, only one
of whom is registered in the Univer-
sity, attend. the same classes, ride the
same elevators, and walk together
along the campus.

George Risko, a graduate of the
Western Pennsylvania School for the
Blind, is the half of the combination
who is ofﬁcially registered as a ju-
nior in the College. Judy, his com-
panion, graduated a year ago from a
four months’ training course for
“Seeing Eye” dogs.

Judy’s Vain

A transfer from Penn State Ex-
tension at Uniontown, George ﬁnds
the University with its enrollment
of thousands quite different from the
Extension where only 90 students at-
tended classes. A

“The few days l’ve been here I’ve
felt lost. But the students here are
very friendly,” George explained.

Besides friendly classmates, George
rather depends on his black-haired
German shepherd dog. After Judy
had been trained by herself, she and
George worked together for a month
in training until they became fast
friends. .

“Judy is vain,” admitted her mas-
ter. We heard ﬂesh and hair rub
against the wood of George’s chair.
“She knows you’re talking about
her.”

Judy’s Sedate

We squirmed around in our chairs.
The dog lay perfectly still. But
George wasn’t fooled.

“Judy’s very sedate, and although
she knows you’re talking about her,
she only watches you when you’re
not looking,” he said. 

With the help of his first “Seeing
Eye” dog, George ﬁnds it fairly easy
to get around the campus and to
classes.

“Judy gets a peculiar thrill out of
riding the elevators. She always

A
W

manages to wedge into even the most
crowded ones.”

Totally blind, George takes notes
in a Braille shorthand. He maintains
that no one else could read his notes,
for he made up the abbreviations
himself. Often he transcribes his
shorthand into longhand or occasion-
ally he typewrites the Braille.

Outside of class, he takes notes
as someone reads his texts to him, or
he may have the text marked so that
he can “cram” before exams.

The dark-haired sociology major
plans to join the YMCA and would
like to sing with the Men’s Glee
Club. George neglected to mention
whether his “invaluable” dog could
sing. Anyhow, Judy, it’s a nice long
ride to the 23rd ﬂoor where the Glee
Club practices.
