i\Across campus, construction is in full swing this summer. The Multi-Purpose Academic Complex, located
on ‘the comer of Forbes Avenue and Bouquet Street, is scheduled for completion in December 2001. The
John M. and Gertrude E. Petersen Events Center, in the former location of Pitt Stadium, is slated to be
ﬁnished early in 2002. But the masonry cleaning and repair in Schenley Quadrangle boasts the most
immediate completion date. According to a Pitt spokesman, the work will be finished before the fall term.

In an age when computer knowledge is
one of the most basic tools leading to edu-
cational and workplace success, many
Americans-are falling behind.

But the Pennsylvania Service-Leaming
Alliance is working to change that.

The Vira I. Heinz Endowment awarded
PSLA a grant in April to help the organiza-
tion work on closing the gap in the digital
divide in the Pittsburgh area.

The $200,000 two—year grant is for the
organizations Faith Tech Center program
which teaches computer skills to people in
low ._income. areas, the elderly and public

school’ teachers at no cost.

‘According to Cindy Wetmiller, the

Western Pennsylvania director of PSLA,
‘ the organization has a two—year deal with
the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh to have

I 4 .0 Faith Tech Centers in six Episcopal church-

es‘ this year and six more next year.

;,.‘;i',2.'.

Computers for. Faith Tech Centers are
donated by a group in Ohio called
Computers for Education of Ohio, which
employs prisoners in the Ohio Corrections
System to build the Pentium II machines.

The idea for Faith Tech Center was
conceived last October, when Wetrniller
and PSLA noticed that there are many pub-
lic school teachers who don’t know how to
check their e-mail, making it impossible for
many teachers to adequately instruct the
students whose technological knowledge is
greater than their own.

“Many public libraries have computers
but discourage people from using them,”
Wetrniller said. ‘This will give [partici-
pants} a chance to learn it on their own
time.”
Last year, PSLA began working with
the Heinz Foundation, the Pittsburgh
Episcopal Diocese and Computers ‘for
Education of Ohio to create a program
designed to teach those on the low end of
the digital divide. In return, in line with the
principles governing service—learning, the

Bridging the ‘Burgh’s digital divide

program aims to inspire participants to give
back to their communities. ‘

_ Cathy Connor Weiss, who will teach a
computer camp this summer, said that
despite the religious location of the centers,
all of the education will be secular.

“We can’t do [this program] in schools
because there are too many rules about‘
when the school can be open,” she said.
“Churches are much more open than
schools. But there will be no religion taught,
people from every religion are welcome.”

. The ﬁrst round of Faith Tech Center
classes will begin June 12 at St. James
Episcopal Church in Penn Hills. Courses
will include an introduction to the Internet
for education and job training instruction in
Microsoft Windows, Excel and Word.

Each class will have 10 to 14 students
and will be two hours long. Classes will last
four weeks. '

In addition to adult eduction classes,
PSLA also sponsors programs for the

ERIC LIDJ I

Senior Staff Writer

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg named
the 12 people who will serve on a commit-
tee to study whether Pitt should begin offer-
ing health beneﬁts to the same—sex partners
of University employees.

The formation of the committee was
armounced on May 22 in response to more
than ﬁve years of litigation involving Pitt
and the American Civil Liberties Union,
which represents seven current and former
Pitt employees involved in the suit.

. Vic Walczak, the director of the
Pittsburgh chapter of the ACLU, said that he
did not have a hand in selecting the comrnit—
tee members, but that “we trust that the com-
mittee will evaluate the issue fairly and
impartially.”

The committee is comprised of six divi-
sions of the University community, with two
members representing each division. The
six groups are members of Pitt’s Board of '

.Trustees, administration, faculty, staff, alurn—

ni and student body.  Lieberman,
executive vice president of the risk manage-
ment ﬁrm Hilb, Rogal & Hamilton Co. will
be the comrnittee’s chair.

Lieberman and retired vice chairman of
BP America Advisory Board Frank Mosier
are the two Board of Trustees representa-
tives. The two administrators in the commit-
tee are Executive Vice Chancellor Jerry
Cochran and Dr. Randy Juhl, dean of the
School of Pharmacy. All four declined to
comment to any media member during the

I duration of the comrnittee’s investigation.

Representing the faculty are Marvin
Fein, a professor in the School of Law, and
Anne Medsger, a professor in the Graduate
School of Public Health. Fein, 62, has
worked at Pitt for ﬁve years and is an alum-
ni of Pitt’s School of Law. Medsger, 61, has
worked at the University since 1965 and
received a master’s degree here as well.

Representing the Pitt staff is Rich
Colwell, 50, president of the Staff
Association Council and Pitt staff member
since 1985, and Carol James, the former
vice president of the same council.

A new term will also bring a new face
to Pitt’s College of General Studies.

Dr. Laura Hastings accepted the new
position of CGS’s associate dean for acad-
emic affairs. CGS Dean Susan Kinsey cre-
ated the position in order to bring in fresh
ideas to the school.

CGS is the college for non-traditional
students, which aims to oﬁer courses more
speciﬁcally designed. for their needs. The
courses and degrees within the school
focus more on releaming or
updating a student’s skills to
meet the current expecta-
tions of today’s market and
industry needs.

Hastings has already
begun to implement many
new plans for the college.

Hastings said she would
like to increase the commu-
nication between CGS and
other Pitt departments, as
well as with the community.
One method she hopes to
utilize is meeting with health
service professionals from
the Pittsburgh area in order
to ﬁnd out which job skills
the health ﬁeld needs.

“Pittsburgh is a mature
health service industry and CGS wants to
help to service it,” Hastings said. “We "need
to reach out to the communitymore and
see what the Pittsburgh industry needs.”

This week Hastings will meet with
CGS’s newly created Health Care
Advisory Board. The 11—member board
will brainstorm ideas and discuss what
new educational needs are emerging in
today’s work ﬁeld. V

In the fall Hastings plans to assemble
an information technology advisory board
to continue on CGS’s new path.

“I will be working with the industry
advisory groups to make sure that ideas for
new programs can happen,” Hastings said.
“Then I will work with the University’s
schools and colleges to get quality faculty
to teach these new courses.”

In addition to strengthening the bond
between the community and CGS projects,
Hastings hopes to help service the growing
needs of CGS by improving .the quality of
teaching throughout the college. She

High court voids retarded
man’s death sentence
WASHINGTON — The
Supreme Court on Monday over-
turned the death sentence given a
Texas murderer who has the mental
age of a 6-year-old, ruling that jurors
were not told clearly to consider his

mental retardation as a reason possi-

bly to spare his life.

The 6-3 ruling faults the Texas
courts for all but ignoring an earlier
Supreme Court decision in the same
man’s case.

' In the fall, the justices will con-
sider whether the execution of
retarded defendants is always cruel

‘ and unusual punishment, and there-

fore should be stopped as unconsti-
tutional.

The court’s- action comes as
more states, including Texas, are
moving on their own to
exempt the mentally
retarded from capital
punishment.

Bush’s approval
rating drops as
Democrats gain
support
WASHINGTON -
Public support for President
Bush has fallen in recent weeks,
led by eroding conﬁdence in his
energy and enviromnental policies
as well as growing concern over the
direction that Bush and the
Republican Party are leading the
country, according to the latest
Washington Post-ABC News poll.

-The president’s overall job -

approval rating stands at 55 percent,
down eight percentage points since
late April. Of the last nine presi-
dents, only two — Gerald Ford and
Bill Clinton — had a lower job
approval rating at a similar point in
their presidencies.

With the Senate now in the
hands of the Democrats, the survey

" found that most Americans say Bush

should stop aggressively promoting
his legislative agenda and instead
should compromise ' with
Democratic lawmakers on energy
policy, patients’ rights for health
care, Social Security andother top
issues.‘

And according to Washington
Post’-ABC polls, public conﬁdence
in congressional Democrats is on the
rise. ‘

California power shortage
mitigated by conscientious
consumers

LOS ANGELES —— Fearful of
blackouts and expensive utility bills,
Californians have begun conserving
electricity at a rate the state has
rarely seen. '

New figures show that in May,
California residents and businesses

   
  
 
  
  
 

reduced power consumption by 11
percent, the largest decline since the
state’s energy crisis erupted earlier
this year.

For state officials, who for
months have been pleading with
California’s 34 million residents to
conserve electricity, the figures are a
heartening sign on the eve of what
could be a long struggle this summer
to avoid recurring power outages.

“It’s extraordinary,” said Steve
Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov.
Gray Davis (D). “People are getting
themessage that we are in a serious
crisis, and they’re responding.”

The statewide drop in electricity
use last month exceeded the target
set by energy officials and occurred
before residents and businesses were
eligible for state ﬁnancial incentives

for demonstrating energy effi-

- ciency —— and before they
were hit with steep utility
rate increases designed
in part to reduce elec-
tricity use.

The data also reveal
that Californians are
cutting power con-
sumption at 4 just the

- noon and early evening peak
periods of electricity demand
that most strain the state’s powe

grid.

Tiananmen S uare
remembrance vigil raws
thousands

HONG KONG —— Nearly

50,000 residents turned a downtown
park into a sea of candlelight
Monday evening, singing songs and
reciting slogans in an hourlong vigil
to mark the 12th armiversary of the
massacre of pro-democracy students
in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.

The protests date back to the era
when Hong Kong was under British
control and have been tolerated by
Beijing during the four years since

' the territory retumed to Chinese.

It is the only large—scale gather-
ing permitted in' China to mark the
anniversary, and Monday’s turnout

that interest in the event had begun
to wane. ' .

Kong ‘people hasn’t died,” said '

y Faith-based charities need to

beware of discrimination

In the United States today,
computer skills are almost essential
for survival. Because of this fact,
the Pennsylvania Service-Learning
Alliance has formed the Faith Tech
Center program, which will pro-
vide computer classes at six

Episcopal churches in the
Pittsburgh area.
Faith Tech is similar to

President GeorgeW. Bush’s recent
efforts to extend federal tax money
to faith-based charities.

The idea of educating more
people to use computers is laud-
able, and PSLA should be com-
mended for its initiative. But, it
should proceed with caution to
avoid certain pitfalls.

Currently, Faith Tech only

holds its\ classes at Episcopal

churches, a condition of the grant
from the Vira Heinz Foundation.
The givers of this grant wanted to
ensure the program would have a
strong foundation on which to
build. -

While these churches are sim-
ply being used as locations for
Faith Tech’s classes, PSLA should
be sure that the classes will wel-
come people with a wide range of
beliefs, not just Episcopalians.

In fact, any faith—based charity
needs to be cautious. If public

.money is used to fund these initia-

tives — as Bush has allowed —
steps need to be taken to ensure that
these programs are still open to all.
But, it is not enough for these
programs to be simply available to
all; faith—based charities must also
take the responsibility to effective-
ly disseminate information about
programs to all members of a com-
munity. Organizers should be sure
that information about it is distrib-
uted in more places than just gath-
ering places of the denomination
offering the service.
_ Furthermore, we must also
ensure that people of different
beliefs are actually using the pro-
grams. With any faith-based chari-

ty, there is a danger that only people -

of that particular faith will beneﬁt.
A Muslim, for example, may feel
uncomfortable utilizing a program
at an Episcopal church.

As‘ Bush’s faith-based initia-
tives begin to take root, we must
also be sure that government con-
tinues to perform its duties and pro-
vide social services, not simply
leaving this duty to the private sec-
tor.

Faith Tech is providing a
much-needed service to the com-
munity, and should be praised for
doing so. Let’s just hope that the
service is delivered in the right-

way.

Tax cut could be spent elsewhere

Is it true?

Do we really have $1.3 trillion to give
away?

President George W. Bush’s tax cut plan
that was recently passed in the Senate is a
wonderful example of the all too frequent
political bag of potato chips designed to make
you think that you are getting what you paid
for. Just like the chips, when we open up the
political bag, we will see that it is mostly air
and a few crumbs.

Put every American in one
room, and "the average person will
receive between - $4,000 and
$5,000 from this tax cut — about
half a used car, a few months’ rent
or a year of groceries. .

Sounds good, but remember, that’s an
average. Your panhandler friend to whom you
give a dime when you go into a drugstore most
likely will get nothing— he doesn’t pay taxes.

“Well ﬁne,” you say. “A tax cut is for tax-
payers.”

OK. Now let’s remember that we pay
taxes on a sliding scale, so the more you earn,
the more you pay," and vice versa. By its very
nature, this tax cut gives more money to peo-
ple who already have more money.

“You pay more, you get more,” you say.

Fine, that makes sense, but it is exactly the
reason why this tax cut; is very wasteful, essen-
tially useless and completely sensationalized.
It is a lot of money, and in the end, the people
who need it aren’t getting it.

Do we really have $1.3 trillion to spend?
If so, maybe we should look at some more
options. _

Tim Russert noted on “Meet the Press”
last Sunday that it has been estimated that the
AIDS epidemic in Africa, which long ago
became disastrous, could be solved or at least
curbed with $5 billion a year for the next ﬁve
years. ‘

0 Sounds like a lot of money until you real-
ize that we have $1.3 trillion at our disposal. If
we gave the $25 billion that has been estimat-

ed, the average American would be sacriﬁcing

$85. That’s a shirt, a pair of pants and a pair of

underwear at the Gap. We would be left ‘with
$1.2975 trillion — not too shabby.

If Dwight Eisenhower taught the country
anything by building the highway system in
the 1950s instead of later, it was that a dollar
now might be worth $5 or $10 down the road;
Not only would our $85 per person save rnil—
lions of lives, it might also save us from pay-
ing $250 billion in a decade or two, if or when
we decide to take action against AIDS. But
this assumes there will be some-
one left by then.

So we’ve spent $25 billion
— now what? Why don’t we
pay school teachers more? Or
how about we build homes for
the homeless? Or help Americans afford med-
ications?

We could do all of those things and still
have some spending cash left over.

Isn’t America supposed to be the free and
visionary country? How can it justify a tax
plan that is so conﬁning and shortsighted?

If we chose to spend this surplus wisely,
while it might not be as popular as saying
“free checks for all,” it would not only be the
smarter thing to do, it would be more beneﬁ-
cial.

If we could stop or curb the major prob-
lems in America and around the world today,
we could do more than simply cover the prob-
lem with money. Bush would be using money
as a tool to fix the problems now, saving us
money later. Spending this money would help
us more in day-to-day life than the average
$4,000-$5,000 in tax cuts each person would
receive.

A child can take money out of the piggy
bank to pay for a broken window, but a car-
penter roHs up his sleeves, gets out the tool
box, buys the equipment and builds a window
that won’t break again. >

In the long run, who do we want to be?

8Bush daughters 5

There are plenty of reasons why George W. Bush has
been a horrible president. In his ﬁrst three and a halfmonths
inoﬂice,healmostcausedawarwithChina,startedona
path to environmental destruction, forced a nonsensical tax
cut package through Congress, re-enacted the so-called glob-
al gag rule that could make overpopulation
problems in the Third World even worse and
refused to do anything to alleviate
California’s power 

But none of this compares to the fact that
hehasbeenunfairtohistwindaughters,
Barbara and Jenna. '

Last Tuesday, the girls were cited for underage drinking
(they’re 19) in Austin, Texas, where Jenna attends the
University of Texas. Jenna received a citation in April also
when Austin police caught her drinking in a bar.

This was Jenna’s second offense; she already went
before a magistrate for her previous citation, and now Dubya
is forcing both daughters to do the same for this one.

What’s so wrong with this picture? Well, their father is
taking no responsibility for their mistakes. Isn’t that what a
wealthy, politically powerful father is for? I’m sure most of
us college students would love to have one to clean up our
messes. After all, Dubya did.

During his years at Yale, where Barbara recently ﬁn-
ished her freshman year, Dubya gained quite the reputation
as a party animal. Although never conﬁrmed, speculation of
his cocaine use is rampant.

And in 1976, he was arrested for drunk driving near the
Bush family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine.

Yet he barely got into trouble for any of these things.
While Jenna and Barbara’s misdeeds are all- over the media,
an enterprising reporter only discovered Dubya’s arrest a
week before he "won” the presidency.

If Dubya were to follow in his father’s footsteps to an
even greater extent (something that seems to be his desire in

MCKENZIE he was 54 and his daughters were only 18.

()l’l\l().VS El)l'l'()R

life), he would ﬁx this for his daughters and allow them to be
like any other spoiled rich children and party for a long time.

In fact, he was simply unfair to them by running for
president when he did.

In 1988, the elder Bush became president of the United
States. At that time, he was 64 and his son was
already 42. .

But when Dubya ran for the presidency,

Thus they did not have the ability to party
without consequence for nearly as long of a
time as their father did

Their father didn’t do much with his life until his father
became president His father’s advisers considered him a
potential political liability because of his failures.

But because he is suddenly president, his daughters are
expected to take responsibility for their own lives much more
quickly than he was. Perhaps this is not such a bad thing.

Just imagine what could happen if both Bush girls
cleaned up their acts (I use that term loosely, since col-
lege students never drink underage) immediately.

They are 19 right now. They could ﬁnd
some ﬁiends to help them buy into a success-
ful business, such as the Texas Rangers.

At age 24, one of them could run for
governor of a major state. Hopefully for
her sake, the Republican Party will be
cruising to victories nationwide that
yearandvotersinthatstatewillbebit-
ter about her father’s loss of a second
term as president

She could then defeat a highly pop-
ular governor (someone such as, say,
Ann Richards) on name recogni-
tion alone.

She , could “”'”

hould learn from daddy

coast through sixyears in ofﬁce with good economic times
and little real power, winning a barely contested re-election
afterfour years.

Then, at age 30, she could win the presidency,‘ albeit

under questionable circumstances (such as a Supreme Court '

case). -

Just think what co11ld happen, Barbara and Jenna. Your
father seems to have found the formula for quick success, but
he found it so late in life. If you get your acts together, you
can have it now. Forget being young and having a good time.
That’s not what college is for these days anyway.

One has to be 35 to become president, according to the
Constitution. But I’m sure they could ﬁnd a way around this.

Does this scenario sound impossible? It’s not if you’re a
member of the Bush family.

ls executing the retarded justicefor all?

Sometimes it’s just amazing what hap-

' pens when lawyers are allowed to pinch hit

for psychologists. We get rulings that disre-
gard empirical fact in favor of vengeance.

That’s exactly what’s happened six
times since 1995, according to the American
Association of Mental Retardation. Since
1995, six mentally retarded individuals —
individuals who, by deﬁnition, do not func-
tion as normal adult decision—makers —
have been executed in the United States.

Let’s consider the facts. According to
the AAMR, mental retardation refers to sub-
stantial limitations in present functioning.
People who are mentally retarded have sig-
niﬁcantly subaverage intellectual function-
ing, existing concurrently with related limi-
tations in four or more applicable adaptive
sldll areas.

What does that mean? For one thing, it
means that we have been executing, and
will continue to execute, people who fume-
tion at lower levels, both adaptively and
intellectually, than the population at large.
We are executing people who show a lack
of basic life skills and are calling it justice.

What a mockery.

While the Trrnothy McVeigh case has
stined controversy about the death penalty

in general, the Johnny Paul Penry case has
given rise to speciﬁc concerns about execu-
tion of the mentally retarded. i

‘ On June. 4, the U.S. Supreme Court:
overturned Penry’s Texas death sentence.
Penry had been twice convicted of a 1979
rape and murder. In a 6-3 ruling, the justices
found that the jury in the second Penry sen-
tencing had not been given instructions
complying with the 1989 Penry case. In
1989, the Supreme Court ordered that the
jury must consider Penry’s mental retarda-
tion as a mitigating circumstance in handing
down the death sentence.

But the high court’s ruling may only
temporarily delay Penry’s execution. The
court said not one word on the constitution-
ality of executing a mentally retarded indi-
vidual. .

In fact, in the 1989 Penry case, the court
held that executing the mentally retarded did
not violate the convict’s right to avoid cruel
or unusual punishment.

Nonetheless, the court is expected to
reconsider the issue within a year in a case
ﬁom North Carolina

Andthis willhappenjustintime forthe
lawyers to start listening to the profession-
als.

The AAMR is staunchly opposed to
capital punishment for mentally retarded
convicts. It might just be reasonable for the
high court, as well as other lawmakers
(including the president, who is an outspo-

' ken opponent of legislation outlawing the

execution‘ of mentally retarded inmates) to
consider why national -

groups like AAMR ﬁnd
capital punishment for the
mentally retarded so unjust.

On its Web site, the
AAMR discusses the
implications of the death penalty for people
with mental retardation. The organization
says, in short, that people with mental retar-
dation cannot be held culpable for crimes to
the extent that the death penalty would be
considered an appropriate punishment.

This is forseveral reasons. Most obvi-
ously, mentally retarded people do not frmc-
tion as nonnal adults and thus should not be
treated as such.

Mentally retarded individuals are also
often easily led‘ and very willing to talk,
making them more likely to be unjustly
incarcerated.

People with mental retardation are also
often impulsive. Other characteristics typi-

SMITH

cal of the mentally retarded, such as low ’

self-esteem and desire to please authority
ﬁgures, put them at higher risk for legal
problems and make it more difﬁcult for
them to be elfectively defended in legal pro-
 -

In essence, the death penalty is dispro- _

portionate to the level of
culpability possible for peo-
ple with mental retardation.

It’s time for those making
the laws, as well as those
enforcing the laws, to listen
to what the experts have to say.

Instead, psychology professionals as
well as law enforcement personnel need to
consider alternative strategies for preventing
the mentally retarded from committing
crimes.

Questions must be answered about why
some mentally retarded individuals commit
violent crimes and why those who are so
mentally retarded that they do not know

they are hurting someone are allowed to go '
-unsupervised into situations where ‘violent -

crimes are committed.

Summer life in Oakland can be magical

Right now, I’m probably more alone
than I’ve ever been in my life — and I love
it.

I had every intention of returning home
to the suburbs outside Philadelphia this
summer when it hit me that there’s not
much for me there. I mean, sure,
my family is there, but most of
my ﬁiends have scattered
along ﬂre East Coast for the
summer.

I’ve grown to love Atwood Street Nobody
ever sleeps here and I know at least ﬁve peo-
ple who live within very short walking dis-
tance. I smile at the children when I walk
past them and their parents smile back at me.
Even the little city binds make the
laugh with pure happiness.

In addition, not having a
television is the best thing that
ever happened to me. In my dorm
room during the school year, my
roommate had a television, and
although she and I never were very big tele-
vision-watchers, I grew pretty addicted to
watching “Law and Order” every night.
Sometimes I would turn it on just to hear
noise in the background.

When I ﬁrst moved in here,iI cou1dn’t

idly watch television during the extra hours,
so I started reading all the books I’d brought
with me to college hoping I’d ﬁnally get
around to reading them.

Before I knew it, I’d become addicted to
books. The Carnegie Library is one of my
new best friends. I go there, take out about
four books, and return the next week for
more. I recognize the people who work
there, but I do not think they recognize me. I
wander through the ﬁction stacks, seeing a
million books that I’ve been wanting to read
over the years and ﬁnally feeling like getting

to them all is possible.

Life truly begins at 11 p.m. though.
Enough of my ﬁiends live in the area that we
always have a place to go. Sometimes we
engage in various forms of college-age
debauchery, but other times we take a late
night Wal—Mart or Eat n’ Park trip. Just
recently, my ﬁiend and I decided to go food
shopping at a 24-hour Giant Eagle; when we
returned at midnight, my friend decided that
hefeltlikemaldngasaladsohernadea
huge salad and dressing ﬁom a mix (taking
a long time, since he too is on his own and
cooks for himself) and we feasted until 3
am.

But, of course, before 11 p.rn. I am more
or less alone. However, I never feel lonely. I
love to work for myself, cook for myself,
then read or write or walk around by myself.
Ipaymyownrentandgrocerybills andl
would not have it any other way.

For the ﬁrst time, I feel independent and
anonymous, like an outsider watching the
curious and beautiful sites all around
Atwood Street, the Carnegie Library and the
rest of Oakland —— a place that other people
sometimes seem to forget can be downright

magical.

In defense of free thought and free speech

A few weeks ago I wrote a column on
the passing of the Beehive (“Good riddance
to the Beehive,” May 23). I never liked the
place and wanted _to poke frm at the people
who were its regular customers.

I wrote on how I disliked those freaks
(which is their term, not mine) and how
uncomfortable I "felt around ﬂrem. Well,
about halfthe people who wrote back get the
joke. They knew I was poking fun and got a
laugh out of it ' ~

But the other half who wrote back had a
dilferent take. They said I was wrong for
feeling the way I did I was told that I didn’t
have the right to judge people based on how
they dress or looked I was told that having
an opinion of someone based on those things
rrrade me a Republican, a redneck, a com-
munist, a racist and a Nazi. '

Have we really become that politically

correct? Does a person not have the right to ’

make his or her own decisions on people
based on whatever criteria he or she wants?
Have we become so liberal that we no longer
tolerate anyone who is uncomfortable as a
result of how people express themselves or
what someone is expressing?

Are we no longer allowed such luxuries
as frw thought or free speech because we
might offend someone?

What next? Am I now not allowed to
look. at someone I ﬁnd unattractive and
think, “Man, she’s fat I don’t want to have
sex with her”? ‘ v

Ifldidthinkit, thatwouldmakeme the

kind of person who makes judgments based
upon  And gosh, I would make
that person feel bad. So golly, I guess it’s
wrong to have an opinion, because someone
else might disagree and you might make him
or her upset

I Now let’s put all sarcasm aside (besides,
no one thought it was funny last time) and be
honest The way people dress is one of the
ways people express themselves. You make
a statement by your clothes, your tattoos,
piercings, haircut and so on.

. And it’s been this way since the begin-
ning of civilization. Appearance has been
used to express religion, philosophies, poli-
tics, social status and your favorite sports

team. Even if you dress in the most com- '

mon, banal way and make sure that you’re
not making a statement, that is a statement in
and of itself.

And just likea spoken statement, one
can agree or disagree with it. And everyone
has the right to think or say, “Hey, I don’t like
that.That statement makes me uncomfort-
able.”

So whenllookata guy wearing a“Free
Murnia Abu-Jan1al” shirt, I have the right to
judge him. I have the right to say, “I agree
with him, therefore I am comfortable with
him” And when I look at a guy who wears
all black, dies his hairpink, has 13 earrings,
12 tattoos, a dog collar around his neck and
drinks his mocha latté at the Beehive while
sneering at capitalist sheep like myself, I
have the right to say, “I don’t like that. I don’t

agree with the statement that guy is making.

. I don’t feel comfortable around him. I don’t

like him.”

And, in turn, that person has the right to
disagree with my assessment. That’s what
makes these things opinions.

_ Opinions are funny things. They belong
solely to the person who has them, and while
they might be right and true for that guy, the
person sitling next to him might have the
exact opposite opinion. That guy feels just as
conﬁdent that his view is the correct one.

plete racist, it’s his or her opinion. He or she

has the right to judge someone, even hate ,

someone based on anything he or she wants.
And while‘I will disagree with that person
and argue over it, I will never tell that person
ﬂrat he or she is wrong and I am right

Why? I have no right to tell another per-
son what is the right thing to think or feel.
Furthermore, while I might disagree withhis
or her opinion, I will still stand up and ﬁght
for that person’s right to think and feel what-
ever he or she wants.

Overall, the thing thatbothered me most
was that people were actually calling me a
Nazibecauselmadeajudgmentthatwas
based on appearance.

Now, I’m a Jew. Just about my entire

 

Jewish upbringing has revolved around the
Holocaust. I’ve dealt with survivors time and
time again. My grandfather even landed on
D-Day plus 3 and liberated a death camp.

I know what the word Nazi means. I
know who Hitler was and what he was
about So, when people toss out theword
Nazi and Hitler, just because it sounds cool
and would make a good sound bite, they dis-
honor the 12 million Jews, blacks, homosex-
uals and many others who were killed
because the Nazis deemed them different

So, quite simply, there is and inferior.

the way you express yourself. That’s life.
Everyone has the right to make a judg-

ment and form an opinion based on whatev-

er they want. This isn’t just about free

speech, but free thought. And yes, having an
opinion might make you a Republican, a
racist or even (God forbid) a Nazi. But above
all other things, having an opinion makes
you the most incredible thing of all. It makes

Amneslac am can

MELISSA BALICK
Staff Writer

The problem with being the most creative, respected and
well-loved band in the world is that there are no standards as
impossible to meet as the ones you accidentally set yourself.

If any band other than Radiohead had released the album
Amnesiac, every critic would give it a perfect score and sing its
praises with the fervor of a gospel choir. But after Radiohead’s
brilliant album OK Computer made our collective pulse race,
we expect everything after it to give us a heart attack.’ That’s
why Kid A got mixed reviews and why, now, so is Amnesiac.

Like people who sneer at “Romeo and Juliet,” insulting it
as Shakespeare’s “weakest work,” some people simply cannot
be satisﬁed with Amnesiac. Sure, “Romeo and Juliet” ain’t no
“Hamlet,” but you’ve got to admit it’s an incredible work, and V
people who read it without having read any other Shakespeare
love it. Similarly, I proclaim that Radiohead’s newest release is
still did-these-guys-make-a—pact-with-the-devil—or—what good.

Often, it seems like when musicians from

Wellwater Conspiracy is a refreshing change.
Although the band is comprised of members of
Soundgarden and Monster Magnet, its sound is
something entirely different. .

Despite the band’s many ties to early ‘90s
grunge rock, its third album, The Scroll and Its
Combinations, has a sound all its own. These
tracks express none of the anger and frustration
that drove much of their earlier bands’ music.

Scroll features former Monster Magnet gui-
tarist John McBain and ex-Soundgarden drum-

as drummer on Pearl Jam’s most

, recent tour).

This album draws more directly on the band’s
early musical inﬂuences, with McBain and
Cameron citing bands from the Byrds to Cream
and The Who as inspiration. These songs show
the musicians a little more grown up and able to
approach their music with a sense of humor.

Cameron has said of the band, “We want to
try to be creative and have fun along the way. It’s
all for kicks.” ‘

They used this album as an opportunity to
experiment with changing instruments and vocal-
ists, with Cameron playing guitar, bass and
singing, in addition to drumming. “Felicity’s
Surprise” even features guest vocals by a man
named “Wes C. Addle” who sounds suspiciously
like Eddie Vedder (an interesting coincidence,
considering Cameron’s connection to Pearl Jam).

But this is the more mellow Eddie of No
Code, rather than the angst—ridden Eddie of Ten._
Other special guests include Soundgarden gui-
tarist Kim Thayil and Cameron’s wife, April, who
plays viola for several tracks. The band also
mixed an old recording by Soundgarden bassist
Ben Sheperd with new music for one of the
tracks. .

Scroll sounds syncopated, with background

vocals that are at times Chipmunk-esque. The
first single is “Of Dreams,” which is a cover of a
song by Steve Morgan. Although Scroll was
recorded over the course of a year, its sound
remains coherent and consistent.

At times psychedelic, at times tending toward
a garage—rock sound, it never has the too‘-pol-
ished (and at times over-produced) feel of some
of their earlier bands’ later recordings.

The Night Garden
Waldeck

emagine music

met
CHAD MARTIN
The Pitt News

Have you ever wondered what‘ a
soundtrack of the moon would sound
like? The answers lie in the new album
by Waldeck, The Night Garden.

Garden is an awesome collage of

penetrating bass lines, tribal drum beats

and tangy riffs, all glossed over with a
lattice of delicate vocals. This makes
for an excitingly pure sound whose
novelty is evident with every listen.
Although Waldeck only has one

“word to his name, there are many titles

that can be attributed to his repertoire.
Waldeck records and produces his own

,music (he was once a practicing copy-
right lawyer) and, among other things, a

he is often thought to be the driving

' {force behind the electronica scene.

The two vocalists joining Waldeck

on this album have also been featured

performers on his first and only other

-full-length album, Balance of the

Force. Former Incognito singer Joy

;l\,4alcom offers her remarkable vocal

¥ange.on seven of the tracks, adding to

"the music’s incredible diversity. And

vocalist Brian Amos contributes a
uniquely sincere /sound to three of the
songs, including the David Bowie
cover “Cat People Dub.”

The album demonstrates ‘ the
Austrian native’s elusive ability to
incorporate tranquility and distress into
one coherent ‘vibe of musical excel-
lence. The feeling Garden evokes is a
reﬂection of the surreal, yet tangible
sound that it projects. The malleable
tones and intrinsic beats somehow nat-
uralize the otherwise completely syn-

jwALm-:cK 

thetic album.
The 11 tracks are a multi-dimen-
sional maze of new and old sounds and
are joined together by seamless transi-
tions, making for an undisturbed col-
lection of sonic joyrides, ﬁtting for
any obscure soundtrack of life.
The title track itself is a
stream of dreary melodies
supported by an insistent bass

line that the Long Beach Dub Allstars

would be proud to call their own.

One day _Waldeck was searching
for trumpet sounds,-‘ and instead he
found jazz great Chet -Baker’s voice
and opted to sample it on “This Isn’t
Maybe.’_’ The album ends with Baker’s
lyric: “This is love/The real beginning
of forever.”

Garden is essential to the collection
of any connoisseur of mood music or

' the lounge style. It is interesting for its

supreme combination of both, along
with many other indescribable A ele-
ments.

f It is safe to say that the European
king of electronica will maintain his
right to the throne in his hometown of
Vienna, Austria.

 

Sticky jam

Live at H0-Down 2000

Schleigho
Flying Frog Records

HEATHER BOWLAN
Staff Writer

Ah, the jam band. Almost everyone
has at least one that they’re partial to — be
it the proliﬁc Phish or the local act at the
bar every Friday night.

But to those who have failed to see the
light of your favorite jazzy-funky-rock
group (who “you have to see live”), the
music often seems, well, boring. And
while Schleigho and their fans are into
their music enough not only to host a “Ho-
Down” music festival every year, but to
release a CD featuring its highlight

   

knows this is because the music stops for a
minute, there’s some clapping and on
inspection the CD player’s display reads
‘Track 2.” .

Featuring an orgy of musical .keys,

guitar and that interminable drum, the

band seems to drift through this song much
as it did through the ﬁrst, becoming fasci-
nated with a pattem of chords for a few
minutes, then tossing it aside for some-
thing equally soporiﬁc. The bass line starts
out interestingly enough but soon becomes
as repetitive as the rest.

That said, “Continent” receives my

enthusiastic approval, because at 12:01, it

clocks in as Ho-Down’s shortest song.

The third track, “Matrices,” seems like
the diamond in the rough at ﬁrst, thanks to
some able guitar work by Suke Cerulo.
But soon enough we ﬁnd ourselves back in
all-too-familiar tenitory, the stereo at this
point practically spewing patchouli oil as
Birkenstock goes up three‘ points on the
Dow.

Optimistic listeners pray that “Witch
Hunt,” the alburn’s ﬁnal track, will reward

opens with an 18-
minute-plus jam of
'Schleigho’s song “Go

Because of each song’s length, only four
songs-are included on the album.

While “Go Children Slow” does fea-
ture several tempo changes from jazzy to
funky to funkier, the bass, keyboard and
drums seem determined to lull the listener
into some kind of trance. Even when guest
ﬂutist Koﬁ Burbridge plays a solo, dis-
playing the capable musicians associated
with Schleigho, the backbeat continues,
like an easy—listening version of world
music.

“Continent” follows “Go Children

Perhaps the members of Schleigho

long, they have hypnotized themselves
into thinking their music is interesting.

Unless you are susceptible to mind
control, chances are you will ﬁnd the exact
opposite to be true. Yet Live at Ho-Down

The world is not fair, one bad hippie spoils

OLIVER B. JOHNSON HI
Staff Writer

It has been said that there are
few differences between theater and
film. The most prevalent discrepan-
cy distinction is that theater inspires
the imagination, while film presents
accumulations of the imaginations
of the artists who present it.

So then what of ‘‘Moulin
Rouge,” a film in the form of
a theatric musical —.— can
this one work transcend
the best of both
worlds? A

‘‘Moulin Rouge” on its
base level is a simple love story.
What complicates it — as if love
isn’t hard enough— is that right
from the beginning the audience
learns that the heroine Satine dies at
the end.

The story starts with the arrival
of Christian (Ewan McGregor).
After a quick mishap, Christian
finds himself the leading playwright
for a quirky company of actors. The
actors scheme a plot to deceive the
beautiful Satine (Nicole Kidman)
into believing Christian is the Duke
of Worcester, a very rich and pow-
erful man. Satine and Christian fall

in love, but when the real Duke of ’

Worcester (Richard Roxburgh)
appears, Satine_is forced to seduce
him instead. The Duke promises to
fund Christian’s play if Satine
sleeps with him on opening night.

During the remainder of the
movie we are shown the differences
between reality and fairy tales.
Christian bases his play on the true-
life love story that he and Satine
must hide from the Duke. While
Christian’s true life story takes

place in a glorified brothel

and turn—of—the—century

nightclub The Moulin

Rouge, his fairy tale

story takes place in a
mystical kingdom.

While Christian sees only his
fairy tale, we see the reality of his
morbid situation. Maybe Cervantes
was right when he said, “Perhaps

Alfred Hitchcock was an innov-
ative film genius and master of sus-
pense long before he went on to the
string of hits in the 1950s and early
‘60s that would catapult him to leg-
endarystatus as a director.

V His films made overseas in
Great Britain during the ‘30s and in
America during the ‘40s displayed
his uncanny knack for building up
and knocking down tension as if it
were a roller coaster ride. /

Three of Hitchcock’s films from
the ‘40s, “Shadow of a Doubt”

(1943), “Notorious” (1946) and Theifilrn takes off from”there,V with I I

“Rope” (1948), are the subject of many twists and turns that later

the Sunday Night Series at the became staples‘ of all Hitchcock.

Mellwood Theater, located
on’ the second floor of
P i t t s b u r g h
Filmmakers. The films
run in chronological
order, with one shown
every Sunday from June 10 to the
24.

“Shadow of a Doubt” deals with
a young woman who thinks her
uncle may be a serial killer. Joseph

.Cotton, who plays the role of Uncle

Charlie, gives a ﬂawless and multi-
dimensional performance.
Hitchcock sets the story up to keep
the audience guessing throughout
the film whether Uncle Charlie is in
fact the elusive serial killer on the
run from the law. It is a shame this
movie is barely ‘known because
Uncle Charlie is one of Hitchcock’s
most memorable characters.
“Notorious” is a story about a
woman (Ingrid Bergman) who is
asked to spy on a Nazi regime in

South America. Along the way she

falls in love with CIA contact T.R.
Devlin (Cary Grant). However, the
conﬂict arises when she must marry

the true story of two
young men who.com-
mit a murder just to see
what it’s like. This film
stands out not so much because of
the story but rather because of the
experimental fashion in which it
was made. Hitchcock used only 10
takes for the film, which clocks in
at just under 90 minutes. Indiana,
Pa,. native, Jimmy Stewart delivers
an all—star performance as a college
professor who grows suspicious of
murder.

Starting in the ‘50s Hitchcock
went on to create such remarkable
films as “North by Northwest,”
“Vertigo,” “The Birds,” and of
course, “Psycho.”

It wasn’t until then that audi-
ences seemed to discover the visual
thrillers that Hitchcock was capable
of making.

But judgingfrom the-quality of
work of his films in the ‘30s and
‘40s, how can we argue with the
cliche — that Hitchcock was ahead
of his time?

‘ I’ll admit, the greatness of OK
Computer and Kid A causes me to do my
fair share of nitpicking too. I noticed
how the line “C’mon if you think you
can take us on” in “You and Whose
Army?” sounds a tad too close to “This
is what you get if you mess with us”
from OK Computer’s “Karma Police.”
And the line “I’m a reason-
able man/get off my _ .
case” from “Packt Like  
Sardines in a Crushed _ <
Tin Box” rings in the ear
the same way as many lines from
Kid A’s “Idioteque.” Yet, Radiohead has
avoided becoming caricatures of them-

 

selves amazingly well, never staying in
one place musically for so long that it
has become tired.

And, yes, I’ll admit that “Pulk/Pull
Revolving Doors” is kind of self-indul-
gent, perhaps the type of song best left to
B_—sides for the hard-core fans. But
Radiohead has always taken chances
with music that the public might have
difﬁculty grasping, and while some peo-
ple give up and write them off as
pretentious art rockers hellbent on
.. "alienating their audience,
' other people have loved and
respected them for it.

Amnesiac is gorgeous

and haunting, disturbing and wonderful

and absolutely worth trying to under-
stand. I’m already prepared to proclaim

“Knives Out” the best single track of the
year, and it’s only June.

This song combines an unusually
upbeat acoustic guitar (something we’ve
rarely heard since 1995’s “The Bends”)
with the pretty electric guitar that we’ve
become accustomed to hearing from
Radiohead, only less sparse. Add in
some freaky lyrics, like “If you’d been a
dog, they would have drowned you at

. birth,” and a gut wrenchingly beautiful

and creative melody, and we have our-
selves a song worthy of real celebration.

The other problem with being the
most creative, respected and well-loved
band in" the world is that not nearly
enough can be said in one album review.

You simply must experience it for

Antonio Bryant trots in for a touchdown last season against West Virginia.

Prrr NEWS FILE PHOTO

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

The preseason accolades contin-
ue to stream in for Pitt’s football pro-
gram.

Two weeks ago defensive end
Bryan Knight was placed on the
“watch list” for the Lombardi award,
which is given to the top lineman or
linebacker in the nation.

Lindy’s, a top college football
preview magazine, recently came out
with its-2001 issue. The magazine
named Knight and teammate Antonio
Bryant to its All-American team.

Last year the pair led Pitt to its
most successful season in — over a
decade, taking the team to the
Insight.com Bowl. Regardless of the
37—29'defeat that was handed to Pitt
by Iowa State in the game, the
Panthers are reaping the benefits of
last year’s\ season. _

Bryant led the nation in receiving
last year with an average of 130.2

yards per, game and his 1,302 total,

receiving yards set a Big East record,
ranking third in the nation.
Knight, a former 190-pound

' receiver, set a Big East record with

26 tackles for losses last season. He
also racked up 11.5 sacks.

Bryant, a 2001 Heisman Trophy
candidate, has been named to two

other preseason All-American teams
as well.

Preview Sports College Football
and Football Action have both put
Bryant on their first-team All-
American rosters. Bryant will also be
gracing the pages of Playboy. There
is no pictorial but he but he did make
their All-American team.

Junior defensive back Ramon
Walker also received honors, making

it onto Football Action’s All-

American team.

Walker earned All-Big East hon-
ors ineach of his first two seasons.
The hard-hitting safety has recorded
double-digit tackles in 13 of his 19
career games. Walker finished his
freshman season in 1999, leading the
team in tackles with 131, earning
All-Big East first team honors.

Despite playing just seven games
last season, Walker still made the
All-Big East second team.

While all of these individual
honors have been handed down, the
team has also received some atten-
tion. Preview Sports listed Pitt 24th
in its 2001 preseason rankings and
third in the Big East Conference
behind Miami and Virginia Tech.

Football Action picked Pitt to
finish in second place, behind
Miami.

The Panthers open their season
Sept. 1 against East Tennessee State.

Pirates must fire

Once again, the Pirates are off to

another dismal season. The timing .

of Cam Bonifay’s inevitable firing
and other changes are vital for the
Pirates’ future.

The ax on Bonifay’s, job should
have been dropped already. Instead
his blurred vision was sub- »
jected upon yesterday’s
draft. Five years, anyone?

The organization needs
someone who can develop
players instead of buying
free agents. It simply doesn’t have

the money to‘risk on the Derek

Be1l’s of the league. I

Kevin Brown would fit this role.
While general manager of the Expos
he always had top talent but simply

could not afford to keep them. The

Pirates are in need of someone _with
Brown’s ability to mold a farm club
system. Brown would even have
some monetary leverage. Not as
much as with Los Angeles, but that
would be a blessing in disguise.
Lloyd McC1endon was one of

- Bonifay’s mistakes. The team need-

ed awholesale change last year, so
Bonifay hired the old batting coach.
Despite his reputation as a player’s
coach he just can’t manage at the
major—league level.

McClendon’s attitude is tough to
ignore, but there was better baseball

personnel available. Larry Bowa'

was a prime candidate, as he had a
long resume of past experience.

 

Jeremy Jester

  Bonifay to win

He’s fiery like Mac but he has the
Phillies in first place.

The Pirates also need ‘-to keep
their fans. PNC Park is a jewel, but
nobody notices a diamond on an
[ugly girl’s finger. If the team keeps
playing poorly, it will be high

school sports champi-
onships that attract
the largest crowds.
Restricting cooler
sizes just pushes away
the ordinary family. It
shows that the organization is acting
like a coldhearted corporation.
Which, it is, of course. The Pirates
want these people to come.
»Lastly,» just when are minority
owners like Chip Ganassigoing to
speak up? They have to be tired of
employing a general manager who
hasn’t won in eight years.

Someone needs to stand up and
make some changes and that person
is Kevin‘McClatchy. , ‘~ ,

He needs to step from behind
the backstop and do whatever needs

to be done to get a winning product.

on the field. The park’s novelty is
wearing off and changes need to be
made. '

Everyone knows Bonifay will
soon be gone. Why not fire him
now? Then the team could make the
painfully obvious changes it desper-
ately needs and bring itself back to
respectability.

ketball staff.

Broderick is entering his fourth
season as a member of Pitt’s staff.
He worked with Waites at Arizona
for three seasons and accompanied
her to Pitt. ' '

- Pitt has appointed’ Jason
Heggemeyer as its new director of
sales and ticketing.

athletic ticket sales office at the
University of Missouri, will coordi-
nate game-day ticket sales for the
