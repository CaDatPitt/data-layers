Cosetti, Duffy Quarrel
At Home’RuIe Debate

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Pitt News Staff Writer
The debate on the home rule

vcharter at times came closer to a

domestic quarrel than an orderly
discussion when Joseph Cosetti
and Dorothy Duffy sniped at each
other throughout their’ arguments
Monday. _ A »

Cosetti, who supports the char-
ter, started the row after Duffy
overran the time given her to
speak. “It’s always a pleasure to
debate with Ms." Duffy,” said
Cosetti. “She alwaysmakes sure
she finishes within her allotted
time.’’' , , _

“I resent that,” retorted Duffy,
and the exchanges continued for
the rest of the meeting.‘ _ A
I The debaters also presented

. facts for and against the charter

during ‘the hour-long ‘exchange in
the Kurtzman Room of the Student
Union. Cosetti, a majority member

of the charter study commission,’

_ stressed that the voting by districts

would assure all residents‘ in all
.)3.1'tS of the county‘ would be
representative.

“Residents in the Northeast

cornerof the county‘ now believe -

their interests are never represen-
ted in county’ government,” said
Cossetti. He maintained that the
charter would give these people a
greater voice -in government.‘
Duffy, a dissentingstudy com-

mission member and ‘jury commis- ,

sion employee, attacked the char-

ter, claiming it would lead to ~

contended the charter was so vague

that the new county‘ executive and‘

council members would constantly

Anyone attending class inthe Cathedral need not

Cathedral of Learning would be a dandy location to
detonate a one- to five-megaton nuclear warhead. -

VATICAN CITY—Pope John
Paul I’s physician said yesterday he
told the pontiff a few days before
his death that he could not continue
such a strenuous pace. -An
ultraconservative Roman Catholic
group has demanded “a judicial
inquiry” into the cause of the
pope's death. _

Dr. Antonio da Ros, Pope John
Paul’s personal physician when he
was Cardinal Albino Luciani,
patriarch of Venice, said the
burden of the pontificate and the
sensitivity of Luciani possibly were

contributing factors in his heart‘-

attack.

said.‘
An organization called Civilta

Cristiana, said it has ﬁled a formal
petition with the Vatican Courts of

"Justice to “open a judicial inquiry

to ascertain the true causes” of the

pope's death.

Cardinal_ Silvio Oddi said the
Sacred College “will not ‘even
discuss the issue. We know for
certain that the death of John Paul I
was because his heart ceased to
beat due to natural causes."

Cardinal Terence J. Co_oke of
New York said Tuesday the next
pope should be a pastor, like John

_Paul I, but he said that does not

mean ‘he cannot‘ be “a good

dinals, including Americans Tim-

Humberto Medeiros of Boston, in
givingpreference to a pope with
the characteristics of John Paul,
noted for his simple ways and

Cooke joined tens of thousands

the 65-year-old pontiff, who died
last Thursday of a heart attack after
a reign of only‘ 34 days. The body is
lying in state near the main altar of
St. Peter’s Basilica. ’ Despite
occasional‘ rain, thousands stream-
ed past the body yesterday. The
Vatican estimated that well over

\

500,000 had seen the body since
Friday.

Forty-four of the 127 cardinals,
meeting in their daily congregation
announced the pope will be buried

the corner of Baum Blvd. and Craig St. to the
Boulevard of the Allies. It would be surrounded by a
-“lip,” caused by the blast’s compression of soil, that

' would rise 125 feetabove the crater.

“The whole area would be very glassy,” Dieter

said. “Almost like a sheet of glass. Anything—in- 1

eluding persons—i_n the immediate area would be
reduced to base ele_inents.. .atoms.”

. Why, one might ask, is Pitt of value to the Soviets?

“Pitt has no intrinsic value,” Dieter said. “It’s

-just a very convenient location...everything of value '

in the Pittsburgh area is within the projected blast
range. The Cathedral was chosen because it is in the
middle of everything.” _
“Pittsburghis very high up on the list of economic
targets,” said the Air Force research associate, who
recently completed a tour at the Pentagon. “Pitts-

A burgh is not the country's number one target, but it’s ’
‘ — not exactly safe, either.”

Among the valued targets within range of a
Cathedral-centered blast would be Pittsburgh’s steel
mills, the area's corporate and ﬁnancial centers, a
research and development center in the eastern

suburbs and, of course,‘ more than one million ‘

people. - V ,

The blast’s effects would reach almost as far as
does~Pitt’s football radio network. Given a “ground
burst” (detonation 50 feet above the Cathedral), the
devastation would reach North and South Parks,
Monroeville and Coraopolis. A higher blast (up to
five miles) would obliterate a smaller area, but would
have force as far away as the Butler County line, New
Kensington and the airport.

"‘It’s pretty grim,” concluded Dieter. “A small
consolation, however, is that they’re going to smaller
weapons. But even one megaton would take out all
of Oakland and damn near all of downtown. Anyone
on the street wouldn't have a chance.”

Ccn‘heclra|“Ground Zero? Soviets Know for Sure

What chance is there that we’ll ever see this? Ac-
tually, no one will ever see it, said an employee of the
arms control center. “You’d never get the chance.
Either it explodes before it’s low enough to be seen,
or it is falling so fast you can’t pick it up.”

“When you assume political leaders are rational,”
the Air ‘Force research associate said, “then you
assume this will never happen, since the results are so
extreme. S '

“But there’s some degree of irrationality in all of
us,” he added. “That gets your attention, when you
think about it.”

Dieter gave an additional facet to the argument
concerning probability. “The Soviets have a dif-
ferent view of war than we do,” he claimed. “They
believe nuclear war can be fought and won. I am ab-
solutely serious about this. They believe that
preparedness (they spend billions of dollars on civil
defense), surprise (who normally ponders the
likelihood of nuclear attack?) and massive attack can
lead to victory.

“They don’t see it as we do—massive mutual
obliteration,” he continued. “They see one side
beating the other. That’s scary.”

.It is estimated that a U.S. missile launched at noon
would beginto strike Soviet targets at 12:33. Sub-
marine-launched warheads would have preceeded
that arrival by some 15. minutes.

“We’re' here (at the arms control center, in Mervis
Hall) in order to study this extensively,” the military
research associate said, “and if you think about it a

"_ lot, it does have an effect on you. But it’s not likely

to occur and we hope that what we’re doing here will
contribute to it never happening. . ‘
“It does get sort ‘of scary at times though:
especially when you get down to particu1afs——and it’s
where you live.”

Tax-cutFever? Ruins 
FDR Memorial Plans

By the Associated Press

WASHINGTON—Friends of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt have
been trying for more than 20 years
to persuade Congress to_ build a
memorial to, the nation’s 32nd
president.‘

They can forget it for this year.

In a year of Proposition 13 and
congressional elections,’ there is
scant support among politicians for
the latest proposal, a $50 million
tribute. .

The Senate Rules Committee
has failed twice to get a quorum
present when it was scheduled to

a vote on the measure. As a result,
the bill is likely to die from lack of

attention. _
Legislation in the House of
Representatives also is unlikely to

"get to the ﬂoor.

And judging from the mail, there
are more-than a‘ few non-politicians_
opposed to a memorial to the man
elected president four times.

FDR said he wanted any
memorial built for him to be

NEW YORK—Has your employ-
er ever rejected your “better
mousetrap” idea? If your answer is
yes you might possess one of the
qualities or experiences that could
contribute to business success.

Bill McCrae, chairman of The
Entrepreneurship Institute, has
distilled 16 questions he feels. can
tip off a would-be business person
on his or her chances of success.
The better mousetrap question is
one of them. » - ‘ / ‘

Corporations frequently do more -

to encourage entrepreneurship than

simple. And as of now, that’s what
he has. In 1965, on the 20th
anniversary of his death, a group of

‘friends dedicated a small, privately

ﬁnanced momument, near the
National’ Archives.

Three earlier plans for anational
monument were killed, largely on
esthetic grounds. One of them, a
series of concrete slabs jutting as
much as 156 feet int0'the air, was
called “ugly” by FDR’s son James.

What is giving politicians pause
this time isn’t the looks, but the
cost.

“While nobody is more enthus-
iastic about a Roosevelt Memorial
for many "reasons," personal "as well
as in the national‘ interest, the cost
of $50 million bothers me,” Sen.
Claiborne‘Pell, -D-R.I., said at a
Rules Committee hearing."

Pell, seeking ‘re-election this fall,
added:

“This will make it about the most
expensive memorial we have ever

— built and for ‘us to go into‘ it at this

time causes me some hesitation.”

they know, McCrae says, referring
to a host_ of small electronics
companies begun, by frustrated
ex-employees of larger firms.‘

. Based ‘on experience, of the
" 500,000 for. 600,000 ‘companies
formed each year, one half will have

’ disappeared within five years, and

the most common explanation

. offered will be “bad management.”

Interesting, but the term is such
an amorphous ,catcha1l it conveys
little information. It might mean
-poor'relations with people, but it
can also mean inferior record-
keeping and inadequate capital-
ization.

 

Equitable Gas Company employees make some last minute adjustments to ‘the Fifth Avenue gasllnes repaired

this summer and fall.

McCrea, himself an entrepren-
eur, thinks it also involves

‘experiences and traits that can_be

pre-measured, helping ' to steer
potential failures away from

business or aiding them in

overcoming weaknesses. _'

McCrae is -founder of the
nonprofit institute and, with the
best legal‘, financial, management
and other brains he can ﬁnd in a
given area, conducts entrepren-
eurial seminars throughout the
country.

‘A pilot program for woman
entrepreneurs, for example, "is

I scheduled for Dallas on Nov. 3 and

4. And a regional seminar for
seriousibeginners and small
operators is scheduled Dec. 2 and 3

‘in New York.
From these projects and sem-_

inars, McCrae and his staff distilled
their 16 questions. if

PHILADELPHIA Pennsyl-
vania’s Democratic and Republican
candidates for governor called on
Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo
yesterday to stop using “racial
tactics’ ’ in his bid to change the City
Charter and run for a third term.

“Mayor Rizzo has resorted to
divisive rhetoric designed to set
race against race,” Republican
Richard L. Thomburgh told a
raucous crowd in the courtyard of
City Hall here.

“I’m opposed to anyone using
racial tactics which would polarize
or divide blacks against whites
along racial‘ lines,” Democrat Peter
F. Flaherty said in ‘a release issued

from his Pittsburgh office.

Thomburgh’s remarks were pep-
pered with boos and chants of

because he had the same name,‘
right down to the middle initial, of
former auditor general Robert P.
Casey—who g happened to be
running for‘ governor.

“It’s a recognizable name. I’m
not denying ‘that. "A lot of people
obviously didn’t'make the distinc-
tion,” said Casey, well aware that
an obscure Cambria County official
named Robert E. Casey was

ming ‘and ‘ﬁshing. And ‘he’s going

Though Casey pooh-poohs the
notion that he’s hiding behind his
lab coat, he’s not’ anxious to grab
the limelight.

“I didn’t' duck any interviews,
but I wasn't‘ looking tomake any

news either,”’said Casey, who has,

declined offers to debate Scranton.

stickers that read ‘ ‘ Charter Change,

Charter change opponents, wear-
ing green and white buttons, along
with Thomburgh supporters, yelled
“Oh, shut up,” and one man,
without a button, kept screaming,
“What are you going to do about
nuclear power?’’

Reporters, wedged within a few
feet of the candidate's face, lost
many of his words in the great din.

“...in recent weeks I have
witnessed campaign conduct on the
part of Mayor Rizzo that should
concern not only Philadelphians but
all ' Pennsylvanians, ’ ’ Thronburgh
continued. ,

“I understand from private
conversations with leaders in the
black community that the mayor’s
statements could well touch off
disturbances.

said.
“I don’t think ‘Scranton will get

Casey said he asked‘ Flaherty

Two weeks ago Rizzo said that

When informed that F laherty had

HARRISBURG——Richard L.
Thornburgh, down in the polls but
still full of spunk, knows he has a
long way to go if he wants to
overtake his Democratic rival in the
ﬁnal month of Pennsylvania’s
gubernatorial campaign.

“It’s like trying to stab a
butterﬂy,” sighed the Republican

-candidate, assessing his plight in

the battle of rhetoric with former
Pittsburgh mayor Peter F. F laherty.

Thornburgh, the former federal
prosecutor from Pittsburgh, knows
he’s some 15 points down in the
polls and has to carry the. ﬁght.
Flaherty’s maverick, tax-cutting
image is going over big with an
electorate tired of bloated govern-
ment. The Democrats have a
whopping edge of 824,000 in voter
registration.’ '

Flaherty is also a tough target to
hit. But the Republicans are just
now opening up with the seige
guns.

-“I think he’s vulnerable in three
areas, and we’ll be exploiting them
in speeches and with our media

PUBLIC NOTICE
TO STUDENTS

The University of Pittsburgh will
not be publishing a “Student
Directory” in 1978-79. However,
there will be an (“in-house”
directory, which is to be used by
several administrative ofﬁces in-
cluding the -Ofﬁce of Student
Affairs. ' ‘

The “in-house” directory is used
to locate students, inform the news
media of student accomplishments,
and respond to legitimate external
requests for information regarding
students.

In order to produce this directory
the University, according to the
“Privacy Right of. Parents and
Students,” more commonly refer-
red to as the “Buckley Amend‘-
ment,” must afford students the
opportunity to remove their names
and personally identiﬁable infor-
mation from the directory. Releases

- of this information, for example, are

made to legislators, groups con-
ducting surveys, lending institu-

‘ tions, hometown and other news-

papers as well .as friends and
relatives who make inquiries. ‘

For those individuals who wish to

campaign,” said the 45-year-old
Thornburgh ina recent interview.
“He’s dangerously close to
misrepresentation when he talks of
tax cuts. After he was elected mayor
of Pttsburgh but while he was still a
city councilman, he voted to raise
real estate taxes 20 percent, parking
taxes by 33 percent, water rates by
20 percent and the mayor's salary
by 40 percent,” Thornburgh said.
“What you see and what you get
are two different things when it
comes to Pete Flaherty. He’s giving
us the smile and a shoeshineithat
are typical of a Flaherty campaign.
He’s campaigning on people’s
ability to be had.” ' .
Secondly, Thornburgh doubts
that Flaherty can clean up the
corruption in state government,
which has seen four cabinet
officials, 26 Transportation Depart-
ment ofﬁcials and dozens of others
guilty of misconduct in ofﬁce.
“He’s above reproach on in-
tegrity. But being an honest man
isn’t enough to clean up a scene like
you have here, where Democratic
leadership has robbed us of our
good name. I don’t see how any

_  Atelephone visit _     
. 1S cheap er than you think!     a

Democrat, no matter how he holds
his own people at arm's length, can
clean it out. And Pete Flaherty is a
Democrat.

“I’m very suspicious’ of a
born-again independent —who pro-
mises to clean up the mess he
helped to make. Dick Thornburgh
doesn’t have to explain why he
supported Milton Shapp three
times, why he called a PennDOT
investigation a ‘witch hunt’ or why
Shapp’s patronage _chief Sam
Begler and Shapp’s hand-picked
party leader Harvey Thiemann
supported him when he‘ ran for
mayor. Pete Flaherty does.”

Thirdly, Thronburgh charges that
his opponent is unable to cooperate
with the groups needed to boost‘
jobs and spurithe pstate’s stagnant
economy. - .

“He has shown a total refusal to
work with labor, business and civic
leadership.” . v 

To get his message across,
Thornburgh is amassing a $2
million war chest, most of it going to
a media blitz designed to build up 2
an image that the candidate admits
is his big weakness.

I

“We live in an image-oriented
society with regard to politics. I'm
not a professional politician,” he
said. ‘

An associate once described
Thornburgh this way: “Dick is
really a warm and happy man. It’s
just that his face doesn’t know it.”

Filling the air waves with
Thomburgh’s message is an agency
headed by John Deardourff of
Washington, who replaced David
Garth. The celluloid spots will
attempt to build Thomburgh’s
image by touching on key issues
early,. then ﬂail away at the
Democrats as the election nears.

Image is also one of Flaherty’s

‘strongest points, built around his

standard speech that he is the only
candidate with an administrative
record.

Flaherty also knows how to
attack. He scored points by
accusing Thornburgh of trying to
buy the election and breaking his

— promise on pre-election disclosures

in the primary.
“He’s a good politician, a darn
good one. I've known him for years

and years. He’s. crafty, opportun-

. istic and has good instincts,” said  

Thornburgh.

“But I don’t take a back seat to I V
anybody on administration,” he.  ‘

added, pointing to"his record as a.
deputy U.S. attorney general in the _
post-Watergate era. " - .

“I took over an operation that
was flat on its back_ and I brought it"
back to life. I have administrative"

experience at the highest level of  .

government,” said Thornburgh,
who has never held elective ofﬁce.

“I have a strong anti-corruption
performance. I feel a sense of need.

for change. And Ihave the ability to _ ‘ ‘-

inspire conﬁdence in the .business
and labor community.” ‘

‘To overcome the Democratic — I

knows he needs to woo disgruntled I I 
Democrats into his camp. Former if .

He also has a planned strategy,

 . , Another
egg. Latest Weapon

 The idea of chemical warfare is making a
ccomeback in the Pentagon, and Army officials, filled
:'”'=with7 fear that" the Soviet Union is making great

A strides in this area, are planning to petition Congress
"‘:for-funds-needed to produce nerve gas. This decision
‘is. a good example of some typical and dangerous
":Tmi_litar.y thinking: If the Russians have something,

” eythen the United States must have it in comparable

 amounts. P ,
._{‘ The Department of Defense is worried about

‘Russia's’ superior capabilities in chemical warfare

and wants Congress to give the Army enough money
to combat the edge.- The military scientists have
-come up with their “safest” nerve gas yet, a com-

bination of products that are harmless when kept
apart. ‘According to the Army, this solves storage _
» and handling dangers that long have been a major“

_;v argument against the gas.
. Even if there would be no leaks or spills, argumen-
{ts presented againstchemical warfare, and its very

morality, should be enough to convince the Congress
that the hundreds of millions of dollars the Army
needs could be better spent elsewhere.

The United States already has stockpiles of nerve
gas stored away——about 30 million pounds worth.
Apparently, that is not enough to decimate an enemy
that has used gas on American troops. (It is the of-
ficial policy of the United States to use chemical war-

fare only in retaliation), or else it is not enough to,

cause sufficient punishment. The two proposed gas
components should eliminate that latter problem.
When mixed, the gas is so lethel only a drop or two
on the skin produces a death marked by spasms and
convulsions. _ 1 .

Another argument suggests that since the Soviet
Union has made such a commitment to chemical
warfare, it must also have developed sophisticated
detection equipment. If that is so, then the United

States can follow the Russian lead. Rather than _
‘producing more gas, the Army should use any funds

for defensive purposes. Specialized equipment could
be emanufactqred orimproved, so the United States
can monitor any of the Soviet offensives it so ob-'
viouslyfears. ' ,
Congressional:opponents’ have suggested that the
use ‘of chemical ‘warfare is only one step above a
nuclear shootout, and the gas attack could be the
event that triggers the holocaust. Since both sides
have sufficient nuclear arms to destroy each other
many times over, it "is absurd to keep increasing

‘destruction capabilities to even higher levels. Why

create just the weapon that could lead to Doomsday

Page 8—Wednes'day, October 4, 1978

if it is not necessary? Apparently, military thinking
does not run along these lines.

Some approve of the nerve gas and give a curious
reason for. doing so. War has become too technical,
surgical and precise, proponents claim. There is less
human emotion in dropping bombs over a village
than there is in facing someone and blowing his
brains out. The argument is that only by making war
as horrible as possible will it ever cease to exist.

That reasoning is questionable, at best ‘(the

A ultimate horrible war could "be the last war, although ’

not by choice), but saying the Soviets will employ it is
not a good reason for the United States to use
chemical warfare either. There is no excuse, in a
world filled with deadly conventional arms, for this
type of weaponry to exist. Congress should make it
clear it will not even consider the Army’s request for
funds. ’

with fellow zealots and form a
voting bloc, even. stage mass
rallies. ’

4) Since one rule of the

’ amendment process has long- been

that you only‘ have seven‘ years to
get 38 states to ratify, panicin the
last two,or three years when your
amendment is in danger, and
threaten to do terrible things if it is
not passed. .

5) New, listencarefully because
this is the key step. Once you see
your amendment is goingto fail,

- despite seven years of hard work

(knowing that no other amendment
has taken nearly so long‘to be
ratified just makes you angrier),
you change your tactics. No longer
do you fight to have the
amendment ratiﬁed. Now you take
your ‘voting: bloc (remember step
3?) and ‘demand that the time limit

be extended for another seven
years. '

Ignore that our founding ‘fathers’

deliberately made the Constitu-

enough so that some suggestions
would fail. Ignore that gnawing

feeling ‘in your stomach that tells

you if the people wanted your

Please do not write any ‘letters

The Equal Rights Amendment

‘Porkers and Graduate Economics

A pig farmer in Iowa, who hates
everyone, nevertheless climbs out
of bed each morning at 5:30 and
works a 12-hour, back-breaking day
so we can eat pork for dinner. Why ‘

. would a person who hates me work

so hard to serve me? _

One . might think that Pitt’s
.Graduate School ‘ of Economics
would teach its studentsthe answer
to that question, but as one of those
students, I venture that none of us

‘ can give a complete and‘ correct

answer, and neither can many of

' the .professors.

No, when one enters the School‘
of Economics he leaves the real
world behind and enters an Alice In
Wonderland world where “compe-
means no competition,
“monopolistic” means competi-

 tion,.and models are studied based I

  Letters

A few years ago the news media
and university administrations were
rubbing their hands with glee and
trumpeting the new era of student
apathy on campuses all over the
country. Lately, however, these
trumpets are silent. Why?

Because there has been a rebirth

/, of student activism, a small but
growing movement centering a-
round opposition to apartheid in
South Africa. Students at Harvard,
Yale, the University of Wisconsin,
the California state schools and

ﬁgsother colleges are organizing
' divestiture campaigns to get their

schools’ investments out of corpor-

ations that have investments in‘

Soutlf Africa—investments _ that
support and maintain the racist
system of apartheid. University
administrators and the monopoly
business leaders don’t like this
_trend at all.

The multinational corporations
and their agents don’t vgant to
divest for one simple reason:
investment in South Africa is too
proﬁtable. U.S. investment in South
Africa amounts to $1.6 billion—15
percent of the total foreign
investment in South Africa and 40

. 4-1; percent of total U.S. investment. on

the African continent. U.S. invest-
ments in South Africa doubled
between 1969 and 1976 and show no
sign of tapering off. This has helped
build South Africa into the most
highly industrialized country in
Africa. The only reason for this
investment is to exploit the cheap
labor force of South Africa, brutally
oppressed by the vicious apartheid
system. 4

The University of Pittsburgh ha i

more than $90 million invested in
private enterprise, 38 percent ‘of
which is involved in companies that
have investments in South Africa.‘

'18 Pitt’s two main ﬁnancial agents,

Mellon Bank and Pittsburgh
National Bank, have a heavy hand in
South Africa. In fact, Pitt has $2.7
million invested in Pittsburgh
National Discount Corporation,
parent company of PNB. PNB itself
has loaned more than $90 million- to
help sustain the apartheid system.
Pitt’s investments in the
automobile industry ($2 million in
Ford and $3’ million in General
Motors) provide another. odious
example of underwriting ‘apartheid.
Along with Chrysler, it controls
one-third of South‘ Africa’s auto
industry, and sell trucks, cars and

.9-frnilitary vehicles to apartheid’s

well-equipped army and police.
GM, which often has
hypocritically against-the apartheid
system, recently made an agree-
ment with the army of the racist
regime to protect its factories in
case of “civil unrest.” In other
words, GM will help blacks achieve

quality by smashing any attempts
blacks make to reach that equality-
a novel concept even for the slimiest
of corporations.

There are many other corpora-
tions in South Africa that Pitt
supports by direct investment. Of
Pitt’s 10 -_largest corporate invest-
ments—-ranging from $1 million to
$3.8 million each——six actively are
involved in South Africa, and four of
them (Exxon, Ford, GM and IBM)
are among the top 13 U.S. investors
in apartheid.

Pitt has another connection to
apartheid—-the Board of Trustees.
In fact, a list of board members
reads like an honor roll of South
African investors, with 15 trustees
tied to corporations involved in
apartheid. This list includes:
Chairman‘ of the Board Roger
Ahlbrandt, director of the Mellon
National Corporation; James
Higgins, chairman of Mellon Bank
N.A., a director of Gulf Oil, and a

director of Joy Manufacturing;

 Organizing the ‘New’StudentActivism

George Stinson, director of PNB;
and George Lore, a former board
chairman of Chrysler. These
representatives of multinational

corporations will be particularly_

unwilling to stop the U_niversity’s
support of racism.

Pitt’s administration and Board
of Trustees have the interests of
business at heart——and business is
interested in proﬁt. The University
always has tried to squeeze every
penny possible out of students,
employees and, as shown, the
oppressed people of South Africa.
As long as industry can super-
exploit the people of South Africa, it
will do so, and the University will
back it all the way.

The money invested by Pitt is
ultimately the money of students
and the state of Pennsylvania.
Students must force Pitt to stop
using student -money to fund its
imperialist adventures.

Anti-Apartheid Revolution  

The Spartacus Youth League is
holding aforum Thursday at 8 p.m.
in Room 216 Cathedral entitled
“Anti-‘Apartheid Revolts and ‘U.S.

— Imperialist Moralism. ’ ’ '

We say the ‘smashing’ of
apartheid will occur as part of a
revolutionary assault against’ the
South African ‘state. Such a
mobilization ‘will dismantle the
bantustans, abolish the color bar
and usher in democratic rights for
the South African masses. As
‘revolutionaries we are for building
a. South African Trotskyist party to
lead the struggle againstcapitalism
and create -a black-centered
workers and ‘peasants’ government,
based‘ on the powerful ‘black
proletariat.

The struggle in South Africa
won’t'be advanced by divestment
campaigns either at Pitt or on other
campuses. Appealing ‘to university
trustees to “cut their ties” (read:
cleanse their hands) with U.S.

‘ corporations investing in South

Africa implies that America’s
mission to democratize the world is
besmirched by its Pretoria con-
nection. "
TherU.S., not Vorster’s blood-
soaked regime, ‘is the most
reactionary force today. American
“democracy,” whose slogan for
Indi'ans,'blacks and communists is,
“The only‘ good one is a dead one,”
atom-bombed Hiroshima and
ﬁrebombed Dresden;
casually wiped out three million
lndochinese and is -the power
propping up Vorster, Marces,

Somoza, Mobutu, Pinochet and the
Shah, to name a few. The main
enemy is at home! .

Pitt's student government co-op did an estimated $1,150
’ worth of business during its first two days of operation Sept.
21 and 22, according to Mark Herman, co-op co-chairman.
“It went fine,” Herman said. “I was quite happy
considering it was the first week. All the customers seem to
_like it better than last year.” , ~
‘A Last year, as a one-day, pre-paid, pre-order operation, the"
co-op took in an average of $1,300 a week, reaching peaks of
bver $2,000. The decision to revamp the project into a store,
open Thursdays and Fridays, was made last spring to allow
the co-op to reach a greater number of customers.
This past week, the co-op moved across the basement of
the Student Union to a new and permanent location in what
' was formerly a ceramics room.
“' “The new location is cleaner, neatei‘, and better
» organized," Herman said Thursday. “We are doing more
‘business than the ﬁrst week. We get the usual rushes, but
it's been generally nice and steady.”
, Herman said the co-op’s plans to add yogurt to its stock
have been postponed until a new refrigerator, already
ordered, arrives.
“We don’t have enough room" for yogurt ‘now, but we
expect the regrigerator to arrive soon,” Herman said.

PUC Denies Yellow Cab Increase

By The Associated Press ’

The Public Utility Commission denied a
petition Tuesday that would have doubled the $251,000
annual increase Yellow Cab Co. of Pittsburgh was granted
last month. ‘ r

The commission ruled that Yellow should ﬁle for another
rate increase if it needs more funds.

The increase Yellow won Sept.\_5 had been trimmed when
the company was forbidden raise its flag-drop fee from $1 to
$1.20. ’

- Instead, the company was only allowed to boost its rate for
each mile after the first quarter mile by about 10 cents..
Yellow said it needed the extra funds for which it petitioned
to pay for an employee pension plan.

BALTIMORE - The body of a man who was found in
Chesapeake Bay wearing diving weights and with a bullet
wound in his head has been identiﬁed as former CIA official
John Paisley,‘ Maryland state police said today.

Paisley, 55, was identiﬁed through dental records, and

‘ died from a gunshot wound to the head, authorities said.

-Bill Clark, a police spokesman, said tests indicated the
weapon was touching the victims's head at the time it was
ﬁred. That could mean either a suicide, or an execution-type
murder, Clark said, adding that an investigation of the case
was“ continuing. .

Clark said no weapon has been recovered.

Bonassi maintained that part-

Supreme Court Hears Fet

l‘. The Associated Press

WASHINGTON —Doctors who
perform abortions without trying to
save the fetus when there’s reason
to believe it “may” have survived
outside the womb should be
subjected to criminal penalties, the
Supreme Court was told yesterday.

Carol Los M_ansmann, a specially
‘appointed assistant state attorney

general in Pennsylvania, urged the —

court to reinstate an invalidated law
that imposed such penalties in the
state. , . ~ .

‘ ‘The law clearly did not intend to
carve out a new period ‘of. time” .in
‘which state officials could interfere
with a woman’s constitutional
rights to decide to have an abortion,

for any Proposition 13 type of
amendment. Cosetti disagreed,
stating that the initiative could be
used to force Allegheny County
officials to cut taxes.

A sharp exchange between
Cosetti and Duffy again developed
when Duffy cited a 1974 report by
county budget director Nicholas
Stabile that shows the 1974 charter

.proposal would have increased the

county‘ budget.
During his rebuttal on this point,

Cosetti said he could not ﬁnd a '

copy of the Stabile report anywhere
and ‘said the county‘ clerk ‘could not‘
produce_a copy of the report. Duffy
angrily threw, a copy of the report
onto the dias a few feet from
Cosetti’s seat.

Mrs. Mansmann argued.
Philadelphia lawyer Roland Mor-
ris charged, however, that the
discredited state law “clearly
intrudes” on the privacy rights of
women and their physicians.

' At issue in a case that will be
decided after the justices have
studied arguments heard yesterday

and those already: submitted in

writing is the scope of a state’s
power to require doctorsgto make
special attempts to preserve fetal
life. — I

The court’s eventual decision
could have a nationwide impact in
determining the availability ' of
mid-pregnancy abortions. If states
are allowed to pass such laws, many

also stated that the‘
charter would give Allegheny

and‘ executive powers. The
commissioner form‘ of county
government combines
powers in the hands'of the three
commissioners.

Duffy argued that separation of
powers is unnecessary in county‘
government because the county
should only act as an administra-
tive body, not‘ as a legislative body.
She said the federal, state and local

Viability was a characteristic of
pregnancy’s ﬁnal trimester, the
Supreme Court said.

In 1974, Pennsylvania’s legisla-
ture passed a law which, in part,
required all doctors to carefully
determine 'before performing any
abortion whether the fetus was
viable.

A _ Under the law, doctors were
required to take all possible
steps——under threat of criminal
sanctions—to preserve fetal life “if
there is sufficient reason to believe
that the fetus may be viable.”

1 Directed. by Robert Altman

If you are planning an expensive spring wedding, you may change

your plans and elope after seeing Robert Altman’s latest ﬁlm, “A
A Wedding.”
‘ Another of Altman’s slice-of-life satires on American society, “A
 Wedding” follows the same free-form format as his classic
T". ’ ‘‘Nashville‘‘—a huge all-star cast of hilarious yet pathetic characters
I interact in a ludicrous, but believable situation against the backdrop of a
lavish Catholic wedding. «

The bridal couple, Dino Corelli and Mufﬁn Brennan, are played

 

moved next to his military school. She's a Sissy Spacek lookalike from a
nouveau ” riche background; he's the spoiled scion of a wealthy
midwestern who has impregnated his sister and maid of honor, Buffy.
,('Mia Farrow). '

His parents are played by Nina Van Pallandt, a socialite turned
morphine addict, and Vittorio Gassman, a gloriﬁed gigolo. Her habit is
administered by the alcoholic Dr. Jules Meachem (Howard Duff) who

 alternates wrapping a paw around a drink or an unsuspecting female
member of the wedding party. .
Mufﬁn’s parents, Snooks (Paul Dooley) and Tulip (Carol Burnett) are
, especially funny. He's a trucker who overindulges his eldest daughter,
V Buffy; she's in over her head with her classy in-laws. Burnett's duties
 onscreen chieﬂy consist of eluding the amorous advances of the groom’s
 uncle, played by the mammoth ‘ ‘Tonight Show” writer Pat McCormick.
Also on hand to add to the lunacy are various members from both
families and a staff seemingly trained by the CIA. Such ﬁne actors as
Viveca Lindfors, Dina Merrill and Geraldine Chaplin play their roles to
,.the hilt. Particularly delightful are legendary silent ﬁlm actress Lillian
Gish as the matriarch of the groom’s family who dies in bed during the
ceremony, and add one Ruth Nelson as Gish’s eccentric sister Beatrice
whose wedding gift is a nude portrait of the bride.

A wedding in traditional society is always’ a happy occasion, but as
one of Mufﬁn’s relatives says at the end of the ﬁlm (after she catches her
macho trucker husband in the arms of a tender young member of the
bridal party) “They always end up so sad.”

Altman never loses the underlying hysteria, the macabre humor that
has marked his ﬁlms, most notably “Nashville” and “M“A*S*H”. The
 senile bishop (John Cromwell) holds a “conversation” with the dead
1.7.. Gish (all under the surveillancegof Gish’s horriﬁed nurse); a frantic
p argument erupts within the Brenner family about whether Buffy
should have an abortion or Muffin an anullment, and the groom’s
‘P ex-girlfriend and the bride's jilted boyfriend die in a car crash after
stealing off in the newleywed’s Mercedes. These are incidents that not
only promote but demand laughter at conditioning and societv.

And yet, the feeling persists that the characters could be encountered
at any gathering-—they strike a social nerve. ' A

Altman successfully employs his unique ﬁlm approach of creating
numerous interactions among the 48-peson cast he gathers, using all of
them as integral parts of the ﬁlm, no matter how small their roles.

‘ ‘A Wedding” is more personal than the standard Altman film, more
deﬁnite than his usual collage of interactions. There is no deﬁnite
statement in the movie, only many small ones.

Nothing Grabbing About     ' a
Golden Earring's New Album

By PHILIP SCALAMOGNA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Golden Earring
Grab It For A Second
MCA

Except for the single, “Radar
Love,” a few years ago, Golden
Earring hasn’t made much of a
dent in the charts. It seems to have
followed the oblivious, path “' of
countless other one-hit bands. But
it is still around, and in its latest
work, “Grab It For A-Second,” the
Dutch ﬁvesome has produced some
good songs. ,
“Moving Down Life,” ‘exhibits
hustle, yet the group pays attention
to the melodic aspect of the music.
The harmonies are ‘good, and} the
vocals by George Kooymans and
Barry Hay show spirit. Sharp
guitar work and a zesty sax by ‘John
Zangrando distinguish “Against
the Grain." * v
The title follows, with fine
vocal work leading the way. “Cell
29,” a gutsy rocker, reveals crisp,
vivid guitar work by Kooymans and
Eelco Gelling. “Cell 29"~is the
most involving piece on the album.
(Continued on page 15)

Golden Earring has a new album out, “Grab It For A
Second,” but it’s the same old sound again.

Losing You To Sleep
Tommy Hoehn _

Tommy Hoehn is an ex-embalmer
born and raised in Memphis, Tenn.
His three favorite performers are, in
order, Johnny Rotten (late of the

With these facts in mind, the
kind of songs you’d expect on his
debut album would fall somewhere
between Zevon’s “Werewolves of
London” and some vintage Cali-
fornia Outlaw rock, all mixed in with
a little country twang. .

Too bad ‘.‘Losing You To Sleep”
isn’t that interesting. In fact, it’s
pretty boring. Eight of the nine

together until it doesn’t matter what
song is playing—you’ll hear mostly
electric guitar bridges, bass,
drums, electric piano, and average
singing-shouting (Hoehn’s voice
sometimes has trouble making it
over the music) of some pretty tired
melodies. , G
The album does sport a few
interesting _lyrics, but, for the most

and somewhat contrived. Hoehn
uses gimmick like punk lyrigs‘set in
mainstream pop-rock—“Hate ‘- my
girl/ Both these eyes  She drinks
in the morning/ Comes with no
warning”— as in Hey Polarity!”

“Fresh Matches,” with a discern-
able upbeat melody and absurd
lyrics is far and away the best song

on the album; one of the two’

Latest Release

(Continued from page 14)

The only‘ disappointing cuts are
“Roxanne” and “Temptin.’-’
Although not‘ really bad, they
sound uninspired and show a lack
of originality. ’

“Leather” is a gripping,’ hard-
and-heavy blues piece. It packs a
punch, and the vocals give it spirit,
revealing the group’s, talent ‘for
performing strong, solid blues.

The album ﬁnishes strongly with
the sweeping, fast-paced “U-Turn
Time,” in a style similar to the
beginning cut, “Moving” Down
Life.” V ‘

“Grab It -For A 'Second” is
Golden Earring’s most consc‘ien~
cious effort to date. It can rock as
well as any group and ‘plays a lot of
attention to the melodic and

Pitt’s soccer team, limping
back to. Pitt Stadium after a 4-1 loss
to Temple last weekend, hosts
Gannon College today at 7 p.m.

Gannon, with a deceiving 1-5
record, has the same problem as
Pitt (2-3-1) this season: a disap-

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

If the number of times a team
turned the ball over was a true
gauge of its quality, this weekend’s
pairing of Pitt and Boston College
in Chestnut’ Hills, Mass., would be
considered a toss-up.

The Panthers were able to
overcome six fumbles in last
Saturday’s 20-16 win over North
Carolina, while the Golden Eagles
get buried at sea by a combination
of their own mistakes and Navy,
19-8. The Eagles have fumbled 23
times in their ﬁrst three games.

“The two most important things
in football are to keep good field
position and tumovers—trying not
to give any and forcing the other
team into them,” said head coach
Jackie Sherrill. ‘ ‘It's not making the
great plays that wins football
games, it’s eliminating the bad
ones.”

“This season has been very-

disappointing and frustrating so
far,” said Boston College head
coach Chlebek. “We move the ball
well early in the game, but then we
drop it on the ground.”

Chlebek also will have to start a

-3;-_.freshman quarterback; Dennis

Scala, against the Panthers since
regular Jay Palazola injured his
shoulder in the Navy game. Scala
will have the unenviable task of
trying to cureithe Eagles’ fumblitis
and mount some sort of offense
against the Panthers.

“Scala could be the quarterback
we want to build our offense
around,” said Chlebek. “He runs

our offense beautifully and throws .

the ball real well.”

While the Eagles have been
having problems offensively with
turnovers, assistant head coach
Jimmy Johnson expressed concern

pointing record despite having the
ability to score goals.

Gannon, coming off a 2-1 loss to
Grove City, returns to Pitt with
eight veterans in its starting lineup.

Last season the Panthers, with a
hot second half, stomped Gannon,
7-1. According to Pitt head coach

Leo Bemis, that fact lends no reason

_, for taking the Knights lightly.

“We can't be overconﬁdent due
to our high-scoring game last
year,” said Bemis. “Gannon, under
head coach Rick Wrobel, is going
through the business of getting its
act together. They seem to be at the
point now where they will play a

competitive game with a lot of depth
from their bench.”

The Panthers have done a little
regrouping themselves after the
Temple loss. Tied, 1-1, in the ﬁrst
half, Pitt lost its aggression, then
lost the contest.

Bemis is hoping his team learned
to proﬁt from the loss.

" Regrouped Panther Boaters Limp To ward Gannon Match

“I think these young men are
intelligent enough to put things
together and proﬁt from their
negative experiences,” he said. “I
think they can begin improving
game by game.” ._

‘should enter at Gate 10. Admission

is free with Pitt ID.

,_Turnovers To Tell Tale of Possible Panther Victory

‘ Gordon Jones is helpless to Lqtrieve his ‘second quarter fumble last week. 4

respondedgto the offense’s mis-
takes.

“We have a lot of young players
of defense, ’ ’ said Johnson. ‘ ‘When-
ever we face adversity, the young
players seem to have a psychologi-
cal letdown. When we turn it over is
when we really have to get tough.”

Senior'Dave DiCiccio agrees with
his coach: The few defensive woes
the Panthers have had so far have
been mental.

‘_‘Yeh, helsaid that last year didn’t

he?” asked Tommy L-asorda,
manager of the Los Angeles
Dodgers.

  

‘.

“Defense is ‘90 percent emo-
tion,” said DiCiccio’. “We weren’t
-playing with a lot of emotion early in
the season. Against Tulane and
Temple, we played like we were
playing against a high school team,

but we” got cranked up against,

North Carolina. ’ ’

Johnson explained that in 1977
the Panthers allowed ascore only 12
percent of the time when the
opponent took possession of the ball

Last year the Dodgers beat the
Phillies 3-1 in the annual best-of-
ﬁve game National League Cham-
pionship Series.

The teams are rematched starting
tonight with the first two games in
Philadelphia, and as many of ‘the
last three as needed in Los Angeles
beginning Friday.

What makes Ozark believe his

Eastern Division winners can wipe

out the Western champion Dodgers
in three straight games? Los
Angeles won the season series
between the teams, 7-5, clinched its
division title early, while the
Phillies had to struggle almost to
the last out of the season to win the
East.

“I just feel our hitting is there
now,” said Ozark of a team that
slumped offensively most of the
regular season. “I was impressed
with the way our guys played under
the pressure of that ﬁnal series
against Pittsburgh?’

Ozark also said he has in a playoff
for the ﬁrst time four solid starting
pitchers-—Larry Christenson, Dick
Ruthven, Steve Carlton and Randy
Lerch. . . . I

after a punt. After a turnover,
however, the opposition’s scoring
percentage jumped to 30 percent.
“We show the players these
said Johnson. “It’s
something they have to think about

‘and talk about.” '

1 Sherrill was conﬁdent the poise
necessary to pull off last Saturday's
comeback will remain with the team
through theseason.

‘ ‘The way we battled back against
North Carolina has done a lot for

‘ ‘I'm certain our starting pitching
is as good as anybody’s, if not
better,” Ozark said;

“Furthermore, I wear number
three, it’s the third straight time
we’re in it, we've lost two, we’re
going to win the third,” Ozark
predicted.

Lasorda refused to debate
Ozark’s bold prediction.

“I don’t believe in predictions,”
said the field boss of the defending
National League champions.

“Number one I'm just happy to

be in the playoffs. Number two,

we’re going to play each game I
hope to our capability.”

Ozark said he will start right-
hander Larry Christenson in ‘the
ﬁrst game, while Lasorda has
named righthander Burt Hooton for
the Dodgers. Christenson was 13-14

this past season, while Hooton won

19 and lost 10.

It's a rematch of the two pitchers
who started in last year’s third
game of the playoffs. Hooton lasted
1 2-3 innings and Christenson 3 1-3
in the game won 6-5 by Los Angeles
with a three run ninth inning rally
after two outs.

conﬁdence,” said Sherrill, "and it

has also done a lot for our football

squad.”

PITT NOTES: The two teams
have averaged 39 points a game
between them through the seven-
game series. The Panthers lead",
5-2, and last lost to‘ the Eagles in
1971...Since 1973, Pitt has a 20-4-2

record on the road. Gordon Jones ‘

_needs only 243 yards for a career
reception total of 2,000.

rk Believes Hitting Will Give Phillies msweep

Christenson, who is 3-4 lifetime
and 1-0 this year against the
Dodgers, had a much better season
than his record indicates. In his 14
losses, the Phillies scored a total of
20 runs. The 24-year-old Christen-
son said he has pitched 11_'i§_.‘.best
baseball this season and use_dfall*.his

pitches. H;
“The important thing’:
make mistakes. They have the best

leadoff hitter in baseball in Davey

Lopes, and if he gets on he can run. . 2

Then Bill Russell follows and then
comes all that power Steve Garvey,
Reggie Smith, Ron Cey and Dusty
Baker,” Christenson said. J

Hooton, who last year walked
four straight in a three run Phillies’
second as 60,000 plus rabid fans

roared with every pitch, saidhe has .

forgotten that game. .

‘ ‘Thinking about last year's game
is not going to help me this year,”
said Hooton, who is 11-10 lifetime
and 2-1 this year against Philadel-

phia. He also said he didn’t plan to —

key on any individual hitters.
“They are all tough hitters and

makeyou work all night,” Hooton .

his plans to compete in two college
sports-,—-baseball and basketball. In
this day and age of specialization,
seldom do you hear about the
dual-sport Collegian. '

But Gissendanner doesn’t con-
sider the endeavor or the time it will
take a big deal. _

“There might be some problem
come March when the two seasons
tend to overlap,” said Gissendan-
ner, who played both 1 sports
throughout high school. “But
March is far off and I’ll worry about
it then.”

Gissendanner decided to forego
fall“ baseball, however, in order to

getready for basketball practice,;

which begins October 15. But he
will play baseball in the spring;
-~ “Ifelt it was more important for

me to get in shape for basketball,”_'

said Gissendanner, whose favorite
sport is basketball. “The condition-

-Deve Diciccio meshes Marv Christensen while Dave Logan observes.

ing for baseball is so much different
than it is for basketball,
emphasizes running a great deal.”

According to Gissendanner, Pitt
basketball coach, Tim Grgurich
isn’t upset that he plans to play
baseball.

“He doesn’t mind,” hesaid. “In
fact, none of the schools that
recruited me (Pitt, Bowling Green
and Massachusetts) seemed to
mind that I also wanted to play
baseball. ,

‘ ‘It really wouldn’t have mattered
if I wasn’t allowed, since the main
reason I’m going to school is to play
basketball and get an education,”
Gissendanner continued. “But I
would have been disappointed if I
couldn’t play.”

Although better "known as a
basketball‘ player, Gissendanner-
who, as a high-scoring‘ guard, led
Class AA Clairton High School to
fourth place in last year's PIAA
basketball playoffs—also excels in
baseball. , 4. » e

which

A third baseman, Gissendanner
hit an impressive .647 for an
average Clairton High team last
spring, and there was specualtion
the freshman would be selected in
the major league baseball draft. ‘

Gissendanner was never drafted,
but still sees advantages in playing
both sports.

“I have the talent—I might as
welluse it,” he said." “It’s the same
withan ambidextrous person. If he
can use both hands equally well, he
should use them. If a person has two
talents he should use them both,
too. .

“Sure, there's always the
thought of a pro career. I’d be silly
not to think about it at this stage.”

- Gissendanner sees, yet another
option as far as his future plans are
I concerned. ' _

“I’m studying computer science
right now,” Gissendanner said. “I
hear the job opportunitiesin that
"ﬁeld will be great once I get my

By The Associated Press

Southern California, getting an

4:" assist from an Oklahoma school, is

the No. 2 football team in the land
while the University of Oklahoma is
still No. 1.

Southern Cal beat Michigan State
30-9 last week and moved from third
to second in the Associated Press
poll, as Arkansas dropped from
second to fourth after needing a
second-half rally to beat unranked
Tulsa 21-13. Michigan also took
advantage of Arkansas’ struggle,

beating Duke 52-0 and moving up
from N054 to third. -
Oklahoma, 4-0 after a 45-23
victory over Missouri, received 38
or 63 first place votes and 1,226 of a
possible 1,260 points yesterday
from a nationwide panel of sports
writers and broadcasters.
Southern Cal received 14 first
place votes and 1,166 points,
Michigan got six first-place votes
and 1,093 points. Arkansas received
three ﬁrst-place votes and 1,062
points. The other two ﬁrst-place

ballots went to No. 5 Penn. State,
which received 1,049 points after
routing Texas Christian 58-0.
Rounding out the Top Ten were
Texas, a 24-7 winner over Texas
Tech; Texas A&M, which ex-
changed places with Alabama after

_beating Memphis State 58-0;

Alabama, which needed a second-
half rally to beat Vanderbilt 51-28;

Pitt, which rallied in the fourth A

quarter to edge North Carolina
20-16, and Nebraska, ‘which moved
up from 12th after mauling Indiana

69-17. .

The only team to fall from the Top
Ten was Florida State, which lost to
Houston 27-21 and dropped to 18th
place.

The Second Ten: Louisiana State,
Maryland, Colorado, Ohio State,
Iowa State, UCLA, Stanford,

Florida State’, Auburn and North

Carolina State. '

Harriers Win
Homeopener  

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff wme,

_Pitt’s' women’s cross country
team opened its home season with
a win over Kent State, 24-34, this
weekend at Schenley Park. .

Kent State’s Shirley Russell '

- ﬁnished first with a time of 19:22‘,

followed by Pitt’s Brenda
Chorpenning at 20:08, Margie Lee
at 20:38 "and Diane Miller at 20:42.

Head coach Alfreeda Goff

partially attributed the victory to 
' the Pantherettes’ ﬁrst home-course

advantage of the year. -. _
“ e had at goodesized crowd of
-family and friends at the meet,”
Goff said. “For the’ freshman,
there were a lot of their friends
from high school who could make it
“to the meet because it was at-home.
Thisimeant a_ lot to the girls.” ,
Goff and her assistant,‘ Mary

Ellen Shea, both predicted that '

were” pleased with performances
turned in by the Pantherettes.

“They did very: well despite a
number of things, including‘ the
fact that/Kent State was late for the
meet,” Goff said, “Kent .was very E?
late which gave the girls more time
to stand around and get jittery
thinking about what was going to
happen.” 4' ' " '

Goff could not’ cite an outstand—‘
ing or drastically improved per-
formance against ‘Kent State.

“For the ﬁrst time: this season,
_the girls really worked like a team,
as you can tell by the fact we placed
girls second, third, fourth, seventh, .
eighth and ninth with all of the
times being close,” Goff said. ‘-‘It
was really a team effort, and ‘I was
very happy with it.” -  51

Next weekend the Pantherettése
travel to Lewisburg, Pa., where
they will take on the Bucknell
Bisons, for the‘ second time this
year. At the Penn State
Invitationals Pitt beat Bucknell by a
narrow margin.

“It was a really close» one last
time against Bucknell, and ‘all I can
say about this weekend is that it

will be close again,” Goff said.

Despite Strong Start

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Running ‘back Larry Sims, off to
the best start of his career,
probably will miss Saturday’s game
with Boston Collegebecause of a
left ankle sprain. __

Sims, starting his second game
at right halfback,-was injured while
trying , to; ‘ break a third-quarter
tackle in Pitt’s 20-16 win over North
Carolina. Despite the injury, he
rushed for a team high 62 yards.

“A couple of guys were trying to
tackle me when one of them hit me
in back of the knee,” explained the
5-foot-10, 175-pound ‘Sims. “I was
standing straight up at the time, so
my knee ended up taking the blow,
and ‘my ankle got‘ twisted.

“I tried to fall forward,” he
added, “but ‘one of the tacklers was
holding me up in such a way that I
couldn’t do that.”

The junior also "injured his knee
on the play and initially didn't ‘think
he hurt his ankle.

“I knew my knee wasuhurt, but
not‘ my ankle,” said Sims, treated
for the injury Monday. “I felt the
knee bend inward. . I tried to
protect it. I/didn’t want to tear
ligaments or anything. My ankle
must have locked in the process
and I twisted it.”

According to Panther head coach
Jackie Sherrill, Sims has improved

since last season, when he played A

only‘ sparingly after starting in the‘
season opener. ~

Sims, who came off the -bench to
score two touchdowns against
Tulane,‘ has averaged 56 yards in
each of the Panthers’ three
victories.

“Larry can make a lotof things
happen,” ' Sherrill said. “He’s

made a lot of progress this year,
and it’s a shame he has to be
injured.” ’

Sims’ versatility impresses
Panther offensive backﬁeld coach
Joe Moore.

“Usually, a running back can
play only‘ the left or right side,”
Moore said. “Very rarely do you
ﬁnd ‘a guy who can play both sides.
It may-be surprising, but there is a
difference between the two sides as'

.far as timing and footwork are

concerned. When you ﬁnd aguy
like Larry, who can play both sides
equally well, you make it a point to
use him.”

Moore will miss that versatility
this week, when he rqust ﬁnd two
separate replacements for Sims.

“Freddy (Jacobs) and Rooster

(Jones) will start at right and left

halfback,” Moore said. “What we
need are two guys who can back
them up. When we have Larry in
there, we onlyneed one other back,

» because he can play both halfback

positions. But when he's not‘ in
there, we need two other guys.
Larry’s the only‘ guy on our team
who can play both.”

Whoever ﬁlls in for Sims (junior
Steve Harris -and ‘freshmen Bryan_
Thomas, Russell ' Carter, Ricky

Asberry and'Barry Compton, are 

the likely candidates) will play most
of the game according to Moore.

“Although Rooster and Freddy
will start, those other two guys
better expect to play a lot, too,”
said the Panther assistant, noting
the importance of the third running
back in the Panther attack. ’

Meanwhile, Sims, hoping to
return for next week’s game at
Notre_‘Dame, is yearning for the,
day he returns ‘to action.

“I want to come back from this
injury and play good ball for the
rest of the season,” said Sims, who
played a.part of last season with a
fractured wrist. ‘

Artrell Hawkins was acquit-
ted Monday of rape charges
brought against him by a
22-year-old woman from Con-
way, Pa., last spring.

Hawkins, a member of the
1977 Pitt football team, also was
cleared of indecent and simple
assault charges during the trial
that lasted ‘four "days.

Crucial to the defense was the
fact that. the plaintiff had
hitchiked to nine other places
the day she was with Hawkins,
including Carnegie, Penn Hills,
Squirrel Hill and Oakland.

Police were not contacted by the
