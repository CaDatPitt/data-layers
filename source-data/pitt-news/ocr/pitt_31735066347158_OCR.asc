Union  Wage Proposal

BY DEBBIE MOXIE

The University has rejected a new
Campus Police wage proposal that
lowers the original demand of $1.50
for the first year to $1.75 over a
period of three years, a‘ source close
to the negotiations reported.

The University, represented by
Pitt Labor Relations Manager Tom
Cherry, had originallyproposed a
-60-cent raise over a period of three
years.

In last week's bargaining
sessions, the Campus Police have
accepted the University proposal
for $200 uniform. allowance, drop-
ping their original demand for
$300.- . -

dropped their demands for vision
and dental carebeneﬁts.

In new cfemands, the University
is asking for unlimited. use of the
Campus Police personnel records,
which includes a record of any
violations of the internal police
code. The Amalgamated Plant
Guards Union Local 502 is
proposing that use of these files be
restricted to two years, the sources
said. -

On behalf of the University,
Campus Police Chief Kurt Graham

introduced a proposal to make ,

polygraph tests (-lie detector tests),
to be used only for internal policy,
mandatory for all,’ officers, sources
reported.

The Campus Police vetoed this
proposal claiming the Fifth Amend-
fment, which protects against self-
incrimination. “A criminal can

even refuse a polygraph test,”
police said in response to the

I proposal.

After nearly 19 hours of
negotiations last week, at which the
University presented several pack-
age plans, a police source reported
the negotiations were “stalling.”
The University is hedging on
matters of substance like wages and
compensation for injuries, one
source claimed. '

Women 's

‘\ . BY RICH HARRY

For the ﬁrst time in five years, the
Undergraduate Women’s Union

(UWU) will not be sponsoring the
- Pitt’s annual Women’s Cultural

Festival, according to UWU co-
chairperson Ann Kelton.

This year’s festival-, scheduled for
Jan. 28-29," will be co-sponsored by
the University Women’s Center and
the Student Government Program-
ming lecture committee. UWU will
help at the festival by working on
symposiums and seminars, Kelton
said.

Kelton explained the UWU would
channel money into funding several
smaller events during the year
instead of just one large function
like the festival.

“By sponsoring more year-
around events, such as our recent
poetry reading, we hope to attract

Student complaints about secur-
ity on campus, prompted newly
elected Resident Student Associa-
tion (RSA) chairman Michele Sikora

to ask for help'in initiating safety,

measures Monday.
Sikora said at a meeting of the
Student Affairs Advisory Council
'(SAAC) that many students had

expressed concern to her about
incidents of harassment around‘

University buildings.
She asked for cooperation
between student groups in.,.alertin‘g

more female participants. We have
about 50 members in the Union
now, but I’m hoping we'll attract
more participants with the events, ”
she said.

The University Women’s Center
originally asked Programming’s
concert committee to co-sponsor the
event, butthe concert committee
refused. The Women’s Center then
approached the lecture committee
about co-sponsoring the event.

The Programming Committee‘
operates under a “ﬂoating budget”

that allows it to use funds as desired
‘within a stipulated amount deter-
mined and approved by the
Allocations Committee. Therefore,
the concert and lecture committees
have the option to sponsor events
without speciﬁc approval from the
Allocations Committee.
Programming’s concert commit-
tee chairman Bill Lurye said the
decision ' not to co-sponsor the

students to the possible dangers
and ways to avoid them.

“Resident students are espec-.
ially concerned because we are on
campus 24 hours out of the day,”
she said. ’

Chancellor Wesley Posvar ex-
pressed concern and asked that a
task force composed of students and
administrative advisors investigate
the problem.

“We want very much "to foster

innovative security measures, such .

as an escort system,” Posvar said.

festival centered on the fact that the
Women’s Center is not a student
organization.

“We felt student monies should
not go into something not sponsored
by students,” Lurye said. ‘

The main act of the festival, a
show by commediennes Harrison
and Tyler, would not appeal to the
entire student body, Lurye added.
“We felt they were too much of an
unknown, over-priced act. ’ ’

Lou Miller, , chairman of the
lecture committee, said the commit-

tee agreed to co-sponsor the event
to “cater to the University with

diverse programs.

‘ ‘We want to reach all aspects, all
groups of the University with our
programs, Ifeel this year’s festival
helps us to do this,” he said.

“The Harrison and Tyler act is
well-known,” he added. “I feel
they will be a good drawing ‘card to
the event.” ._ '

NaderPounces On Corporations  

BY TOM WASELESKI

Corporations enjoy more rights in
the United States than citizens,
 Nader charged last night in

/David Lawrence Hall. '

The famed consumer advocate-

blamed lethargic consumers, com-
placent politicians and apathetic
students- for allowing large corpora-
tions to operate under charters that
make a sham of legal accountability.
“A corporation is able to tellyou
what to do without the pretense of
the consent of the victimized, and
that’s further than the government
goes, ’ ’ Nader told the near-capacity
-crowd. I
“If General Motors decided to
sell the Buick division,” he said,
‘ “the board of directors could do it
without the shareholders’ con-
sent.” ’ _
He challenged students to write
an essay on any of America’ s largest
industries, claiming too little is

-. taught about , corporations at-. A’
' collgegesand universities becauseof «

  
 
 

charter is less known" than the
terrain of Mars,” he said.
“Four years ago at Pitt the
students had over 50% of the
students’ names on a petition to set
up a public interest research group
to analyze the problems of the
state,”_ Nader said. “And, like
Penn State, the trustees here turned
it down.”.‘ — 

He said it was the first time in his
career of consumer advocacy a
board of trustees turned down such
a petition for public research.

Nader also suggested the trus-
tees would oppose the Pitt‘ Law
School if it tried to analyze corporate
dealings such as the recent consent
agreement between U.S. Steel
Corp. and the Environmental
Protection.Agency.

Besides -.attacking the large
corporations, Nader contended the

‘ coun_try’s use of nuclear power will

inevitably lead to catastrophe.’
He went on to score students for

Posvar asked that Assistant Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs
William Markus, Assistant Vice
Chancellor for Planning and Budget
John Yeager and Assistant Director
of Residence Life Jo Ann Gibbs

Some of the problems cited by
students at the SAAC meeting were

Psychology

Prominent

Cas Major

BY THERESA MULAC

Psychology has taken the lead as
the most popular major in the
College of Arts and Sciences (CAS),
according to CAS Dean Robert
Marshall. A

Ten years ago, English had the
highest enrollment‘. Marshall said
the interest in psychology climaxed
in the late 60s and early 70s.

Donald McBurney, temporary
assistant chairman of the psychol-
ogy department said, “Thereason
for the increase of psychology
majors was due to the military’s
application of psychological ideas
and clinical psychology during the
post World War II era of veterans. ”

Last year, 176 psychology majors
graduated from Pitt, a.19% increase
over the 34 psychology majors who.

 8 Support The Co-Op

Everybody remembers the broken campaign promises. 8 “Peace with
Honor,” “Lowered Taxes,” “Full Employment” and “A chicken in

every pot” to name a few.

V It's the fulﬁlled promises that the
Like Barry Weisband’s food co—op.

public has to jog it’s mind about.

Student Government started the co-op last-spring, as Weisband
promised. And it has been operating full time this fall, providing
Students with ﬁ-esh ﬁuits and vegetables at near wholesale prices.
Orders are up ﬁom 105 the ﬁrst week to 175 last week.

Any shortcomings the co-op has cannot be blamed on Student
Government. Instead it is the fault of their constituents. The theory
behind a co-operative is that everyone who participates also donates

some of his time to the co-op.

Such is not the case with Pitt's food co-op. A group of 25 is doing the
work for the 175 who order. Some work as much as 12 hours per week for
the committee. They're all doing at least seven times as much work as

they should.

Weisband has plansfor expanding the co-op. He would like to see it
change to a storefront fomiat with students selecting and bagging their
own ‘orders. But there are obstacles to this expansion. »

Like lack of student support. The work is not difﬁcult. People are
needed to bag the orders before the co-op opens on Thursdays for
distribution. There is so much work for so few people now that the co-op
has to open a half an hour to an hour late. Weisband would like to plan a
system of incentive for co-op volunteers in the form of discounts on the
food they buy. But he can’t make any promises yet.

The co-op is a service created for and by the students. And it can go
nowhere without them. The next general membership meeting is

Tuesday, Nov. 2.

Information can be obtained at the Student

Government oﬁices on the third ﬂoor of the Student Union. Go there.

Faculty Has No Time Forlt  

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The question of the reproduc-
tive processes of faculty has always
captured the imagination of poets
and other civilized folk. It is a
known fact that.faculty die, or at
least are buried. Many have noted
however that we always seem to
have enough faculty to go around.
lpso facto faculty must reproduce,
somehow.

Some have pointed to graduate
schools, but anyone that’s' ever
talked to a graduate student knows
that they can’t be the same faculty

The subject of reproduction was
recently a topic of discussion in one
of the more disgusting bars that
cling to the edges of campus. How
it has \ avoided demolition has,

sparked a whole generation of

rumors’about the augmented

» income of public health inspectors.

The man who addressed the
question of faculty reproduction
was one Samuel Q. Jennikins, a
shambling tenured professor in the
Department, as he calls it.

Jennikins, was in a heated
discussion‘ with a rather shady
women known as Lolita, who could
easily be accused of being a‘ tramp
save _for the fact she was about
"eighty nine years old.

“Ah come on Doc,” Lolita said, ,
ﬁlling their two’ dirty glasses with e
‘ some fresh Stroh’s,. “I heard all

about you -professors and those
undergraduates.” Lolita had a

charmingly crude way of expres-
sing herself. ' '

Jennikins sneered. He was
brooding over the state of the ditto
machine in the Department.

“Well, I think you’re talking to
the wrong people Lo. Faculty
members of any genital persuasion
rarely have time for that sort of
thing. Of course I can only speak of
the better class of faculty member.
there are philistines everywhere.”

Jennikins took a sip of his beer,
an unusual action since he normally
sucks it in. —

“The problem with outsiders is

that they never fully "realize the
sacriﬁces a faculty member must

make for the sake of theprofession. -

All too often it amounts to
celibacy,” Jennikins said.‘
“Celibacy?” Lolita

“Can you imagine a faculty
member taking timeout from work
on a curriculum committee to have

BY SUSAN SKLAR

Two feminist writers, Adrienne
Rich and Charlotte Painter, read
from their most recent works last
Friday in the Student Union Lower
Lounge. Their presentation was
sponsored by Pitt’s Undergraduate
AWomen’s Union. and the Women
Writers’ Group.
Rich captivated an audience of
several hundred people when she
read from her recently published

book, Of Woman Born: Motherhood P

as Experience and Institution. '

Although she is known primarily as
a poet—Of Woman Born is her first
prose volume. Rich described it as
“a fusion of personal experience,

historical research, political anal- '
P ysis and the study of women’s

lives.” She also called the book
“overtly and militantly feminist.”

Rich has piercing eyes and uses
/penetrating language. Her ideas
were exciting, unsettling "and
sometimes threatening but she
consistently managed to inspire her
listeners with a sense of deter-
mination, leaving them breathless
after an hour. I

In readings from her book, Rich
emphasized that it is vital that
women «work toward changing
institutions, such as traditional
motherhood, which have prevented
them from experiencing their own
power.

“There is an inescapable corre-
lation between the idea of
motherhood and the idea of
power,” Rich said from the last
chapter of her book she read. ‘ ‘The
female body has been both territory

and machine, virgin territory to be ’

exploited and assembly line turning
out life. We need to imagine a world
in which every woman . is the

Could you, wouldiyou, spin a yoyo
for more than 48 hours? Play
nonstop Ping-Pong or stand on
you-r head for three days? Bill
McCabe is hoping "you will.

McCabe is the chairman of
Homecoming 1976, the theme of
which is “record breakers."

“Recordbreakers just seemed to
fit with the football team in the top‘

‘ five and Dorsett closing in on Archie

Griffith's record," McCabe said.
“It's the type of thing we could
generate a lot of spiritwith."
McCabe and Homecoming publi-
city chairman Bob Charles now are
looking for students interested in
breaking a record themselves;
namely, a feat recorded ‘in the
Guinness Book of World Records.
An attempt will be made to provide
space at Pitt Stadium prior to the
Homecoming game on Nov. 6 for
those who wish to break a record
there or those who want to break a
marathon record and have it endat
igametime. All ideas are subject to

.'thc comniittee's approval, accord-
ing to McCabe, and any ideas

considered hazardous to the health
of a student will be rejected.

_Medical attention will be available

throughout the marathons. " p
Record-breaking will by no
means be limited to fraternities and
sororities, although -they are
expected to providethe biggest
-turnout. Charles said.
» "Usually the involvement -from
the dorms is negligible.
usually comes from the Greeks,"

. Charles said.

' ‘_Uneof the things we’re’trying to
do is‘ get more involvement,"
McCabe added. , “We're ‘tryingvto

In such a world, women will truly

but the visions and the thinking

Charlotte Painter read later in the
evening and both she and Rich led
the afternoon workshoip. During

the workshiop Painter discussed’

‘mode of expression. Painter is a
published diarist and a teacher of

collection of women’s diaries in a
book called Revelations.

Charles had planned to set a record
with an 81-word title -- “Record
Breakers" plus 79 adjectives.

“Unfortunately, a letter ex-

informed the Homecoming com-

mittee that an even longer title was
already in their listings.

In the afterword of that ‘book
Painter writes, “...to those of us
who are concerned more about
quality than sensation, and partic-
ularly about the quality of our own
inner space, the diary is a simple
direct means of exploring it.”

Later, Painter read from her new ‘

book called Seeing Things. The
novel, which has for its narrator a
spirit guide, is, Painter said, “about
Berkeley, California, the kinds of
spiritual trips that are going on
there, the instant salvationism.”

"People are still in the process of

who will not yet divulge what

Heart Rocks Mosque Crowd 3""P9 P°"”"'°”9 G°°di
  But Lacks Pizzaz  

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Jimmy Page, Paul Rodgers and
Mick Jagger move over, the girls

' are coming! 1
Monday night before a sellout

crowd at the Syria Mosque, the
Seattle-based group, Heart, prdved
that females definitely have a place
in hard rock music. Led by the
Wilson sisters, Annie and Nancy,

Heart blasted its way through an.

hour and a half set of clean acoustic
ballads and kick-out-the-jams rock-
ers.

Anne Wilson is one of the most

' talented vocalists to emerge from

the hard-rock heap in a long while.
This shaggy, jet-black-haired vocal-
-‘ist is the core of I-leart's music.
On “Heartless," “Crazy On
and “Magic: Man,” she
provided as much stage chutzpah as
Grace Slick, yet retained her little
girl vulnerability on the ballads,

- “Dreamboat Annie,” “Soul of the

Sea” and Nillson’s “Without You.”
Nancy played acoustic guitar and
sang chorus vocals.

I was amazed by the professional-
ism of Heart. For a band with only
one national album to its credit,
band’ members seemed to be in

Diamond's Latest--Not a Gem  

or 'roM WASELESKI

Beautiful Noise, Neil Diamond.
Columbia Records, PC33965.
Neil Diartiond, has occupied a
precarious position in the last few
years of his . musical career,
catering mainly to a constantly
aging mainstream pop audience.

l{1 ‘I ‘I/'47 K17 :1./'l’~ M 71’

Perhaps he remains truer to i"

.music, and, hence, his fans, by‘

writing apart from Top Forty trends
and progressive rock innovations.

Somehow, though, the last
several albums haven't been the
‘acoustic, spiritual gems one would

expect. While Diamond has been -

packing them in on his late summer
tour, they’re obviously not coming
to hear the new stuff.

Serenade appeared to be just an
excuse for getting another album
o.ut, and its precedent, the
soundtrack for Jonathan Livingston
Seagull could only have been as
abominably, embarassing for
diamond as it was to those who had
tlielaughable task of reviewing it.

‘Beautiful ‘Noise--clever title
(could it be a pun?-)--is quite an
improvement, but is it good? .

5 Diamond pens on the' album
sleeve in ‘some of his. most
self-serving prose, “This ‘album is
a series of recollections)" .It is made

softer pieces. And their male
back-up band provided a compat-
ible mixing of the sexes. "
The unheralded and glowing light
of Heart was their lead guitarist,
Roger Fischer. In his spotlight
lead-work on “Heartless,” Magic
Man” and “Crazy on You,” he
seemed a young'Jimmy Page. In
fact, Heart seems to have been
weaned on Britain’s Led Zeppelin.
Their drummer looked and
played in a style similar to John
(Bonzo) Bonham’s. “Devil De-

';¢\\

called a renaissance of the

- American spirit, others, the begin-

nings of a new age of decadence..”
The period Diamond attempts to
chronicle is the early sixties, a time
that would have better been left to
die like ‘all other eras, rather than
be peddled like an oddly beautiful
tincup on some junkman’s shelf.
Self-styled chroniclers of the day in
all forms of art have done more
damage to the early sixties than the

early sixties did to itself.

Neil Diamond, while hardly

.- being detrimental, offers no insight

either. , .
Beautiful Noise sounds like a_
collection of Broadway‘ tunes,
ranging from the faddishly reggae
“Don’t Think...Feel" to’ the

Dixieland ‘ ‘ Stargazer. ’ ’
The titlecut and ‘‘If You Know -

What I Mean” are "the most

respectable tracks _on the record,

but then they don’t break any new
ground, borrowing heavily from
earlier hits “Cracklin’ Rosie” and
“I Am I Said,” res-pectjvely.

“Surviving the Life” could easily

light,” a cut from an upcoming
album, was a direct mimic of
Zeppelin’s “No Quarter.” And
when Heart really drove the crowd
to ecstasy, ‘ they were playing
Zeppelin’s concert opening tune
“Rock n’ Roll.”

This tactic of paying homage to
idols is admirable but, at the same
time, foolish. Heart’s material can
carry a crowd on it’s own merit.
They should have realized they
don’t need skeletons from a dusty

, rock closet in order to win a crowd.

‘Heart could definitely be a major
and innovating group. Females

With Anne and

To be fair, John Schmidt’s stripe
paintings exhibited at the Gang Aft
Agley Gallery in Mount Washing-
ton is technically beautiful, but
uninteresting. The show consists of
10 paintings, all variations on the
theme of horizontal, vertical and
sometimes diagonal stripes of color.

The major compositional device
used by Schmidt. in his paintings is
simple repetition. His paintings are
ﬂat, two-dimensional images.

Schmidt works on a slick surface,
canvas or paper treated with several
"coats of gesso (a plaster of paris and
glue mixture), and one coat of
acrylic matte medium, a latex
substance similar to the basic
acrylic vehicle used to suspend the
pigment in all acrylic paint. This
treatment produces a poreless,
plastically surface for the painting.

He uses thin layers of watered
acrylic paint, sprayed on with an air
brush and tape stencils, to produce
his stripes.

Schmidt’s paintings are funda-

mentally experiments with the

optical effects of different colors
placed side by side. His titles often
reflect the emotional connotations
of these color combinations. One

' composition of bands of reds and

greys, colors one would. see
watching a sunset, is entitled ‘ ‘Grey
Horizon.” Another painting that
uses ‘many oranges is entitled
“Autumn Orange.”

In two of the paintings, Schmidt
breaks the monotony of the stripe
pattern by adding areas of a
different color within the stripe.

These additional colors create a.

kind of shimmering, zig-zag pattern
acrossathe background of horizontal
stripes. The titles of ‘the two

Sabbath Re|eases‘Eestasy’ -

BY JAMES SPARK

Technical Ecstasy
Black Sabbath
Warner Brothers [BS 2969]

You probably remember the
shocking audio excesses of the
infamous Black Sabbath back‘ in
.1972. Since then, the_Sabbath
‘drought has beenibroken only once
with last year's promotion of the

‘- band’s ear-shattering epic Sabo-'

tage-. _

Presumably, "a long overdue tour
will now materialize in conjunction
with last week’s release of t;ne,j~ﬁéw

‘LP Technical Ecstacy.

This latest work heralds a new era
of Sabbath music. That has ‘been
said before since, unlike _some

' heavy metal bands, Sabbath never

seems to stagnate musically from
However,
this time the change is fundamen-
tal, involving a new sound that
ventures into some.les'sp profound

,- subject matter. .
In other ‘words, where Paranoid '
.<197.0> 99nt=:ﬁ.ned. s°nsS~that dealt

almost exclusively with _death,
destruction and acid indigestion of
the soul, Ecstacy branches out into
love songs and political satire in
addition to their usual menu.
The album opens with a fast,
vigorous, number called “Back
Street Kids,” an autobiographical
account of vocalist Ozzy ’Osboun’s
life. The next cut, “You Won't
Change Me,” is probably the best
on the entire album. Guitarist -Tony
Iommi (still playing a 1961 Les
Paul) combines his skill with George
Woodruffe’s complex synthesizer,
scoring a most pleasant effect.
Also on side one is a trashy and

mercifully short track featuring Bill
~.Ward;'—in a ‘rare foray out from

behind his drum set—on vocals.
The messageof this song seems to
be “Leave the singing to Ozzy."
Lastly comes the longish cut
“Gypsy” (5:10). This'is'an example

‘ of the . old. Sabbath," musically

updated, but still, unmistakably
occultish.‘ To wit: “Watched the
universe from the end of another

    
  

Side two is more or less a total
loss, being populated with songs
dealing with transvestite presi-
dents, inexpensive prostitutes and
MDs with odd habits. ‘One saving
grace evident in all of these
numbers is Iommi’s ﬂashy and
never hackneyed guitaring.

His peak seems to have been

reached on this album with the song .,
“Dirty Women","”' iifwhich his rapid "

tempo changes remind one of ‘ ‘N. I.
B.” from -the band’s first LP.
,.Combining a soft, acoustic guitar
melodywith syrupy synthesizer on
“She’s Gone,” Sabbath falls short

._,_ of earlier pieces done in a similar_

vein".

Despite its shortcomings, this j

"album is worth the price.. When

. Sabbath is bad, they can turn out ;,

some real lemons, but as is

demonstrated, on - Ecstacy, when

they’re good, they’re very good.

In a recent interview, ‘Bill Ward .

claimed that Sabbathwas no longer
out to prove themselves, better than

other bands. That may well "be, but _ .

(the son of the pie-in-the-face
comedian, Soupy Sales,) used to
play with Todd Rundgren.

Paris has been around the block a
few times, yet they seem to be
trying to create their ‘own heavy
metal style. Their style of dress
(Welch, in a white Havanna suit
looked like an amancipated Elton
John; Cornick, in green jumpsuit
and red beret, a ﬂakey cafe artist;

and Sales, a satin-suited gypsy) is
colorful, but their music is heavy
handed and, at times, monotonous.

“Heart of Stone, ” “Blue Robin,"
“New Orleans” and “Big Towne
2061," were all insipid heavy metal
tunes that lacked punch. Paris

would be a much more complete and '

solid band if they took on another
instrumentalist to beef up their
attack.

Jazz 1

Yes, the jazz-blues are back, as
Nathan Davis directs Pitt’s sixth
annual jazz seminar and concert,
tomorrow through Saturday.

Coordinated by Pitt’sjazz studies

burgh’s Some of God’s Children
and New York's Martin Luther King
Glee_Club.

Saturday night, Carnegie Hall
will mellow out with the event’s
culminating concert, emceed by
WAMO’s Bev Smith.

Paintings

(‘Continued from Page 10)

paintings using this effect are as
straight forward as Schmidt's other
titles. They are called “Verdant
Shift” and “Green Shimmer.”

Schmidt handles.his tools com-
petently. The paintings all have a

superhuman perfection. One of his ~

most interesting techniques is to
spray an area of color with a
contrasting co_lor.say red over blue,
which makes the blue seem to
vibrate.

It takes him a long time to make a
painting, since he builds ‘up colors
slowly misting them onto the canvas
with the air brush.

The thing that makes this show
disappointing is Schmidt’s use of a
class of painting already explored
by several other artists, namely,
stripe painting, which is itself a
repetitious form of painting. The
paintings are very well done, and
their colors are pleasant, but they
leave one feeling somewhat bored.

BY STEVE SYBERT

Once in 1968, when Pitt head
coach Johnny Majors was in his
first year at Iowa State trying to
fatten up one of the Big Eight’s
most starving football programs,
only 12,000 fans felt watching his
team was more worthwhile that the
first day of pheasant season.

And this week, a mere 28,000—
capacity, but generally a sparse,
crowd, for the performance of the
number-two ranked collegiate team
in the. nation—will pack Navy-
Marine Corps Stadium in Anna-
polis, Maryland, to see if the
Panthers can hold off the pesty
Midshipmen,_who upset Pitt, 17-0,
last season, when the Panthers
were cruising along at 5-1, and
came very close the two previous
years. _

For Navy, though, cruising
beneath the " surface with a-
disappointing 31-5 record after
finishing 7-4 last year, it will be the
ing of P nther seaso when

   

   

.a£

 

the two teams meet for the 25th
time on Saturday (Pitt holds a
slight 12-10-2 edge).

“Nobody's given us a tougher
time with the ability. they
possessed,“ Majors said at the
weekly media luncheon yesterday,

country who does as well as (Navy
coach) George Welsh does with the
material he has.”

Welsh has been trying to
revitalize a program which has

seen only one winning season in '

the last 10 years—"last season.

even with the lack of talent—or is it
the lack of stress placed on’ service
academy football?—Welsh has
managed a 15-18 record in three
years at the helm. But with Pitt
(6-0),‘ Notre Dame and Georgia

Tech awaiting, the Middies could I

finish 3-8 or worse, if they fail to
defeat Syracuse and Army, their
closest competition.

“We got a lot of problems, a lot
of big ones," Welsh said yesterday
via a telephone hookup. “We lost
nine regulars (including Panther-
killer Chet Moeller)_ from our
defense. We don’t have quite the
quality of athletes that we had last
year. '

“When you’re 1-5, you don’t
have too many bright spots,” he
continued, “but we do have some
individuals who are playing very
well. In Jeff Sapp, I don’t think
there's a better middle guard in the
country, including Al Romano.”

That may be an overstatement, '

but Sapp has made 90 tackles so far

' this season, 12 of them for losses,

to 50 tackles for Romano. Sapp’s
toughest job, along with the rest of
the.Navy defense, will be to stop
Tony Dorsettswho will be attempt-

ing, with 152 yards needed, to I

break the all-time major college
career rushing mark of 5,177 yards
owned by Archie Grifﬁn.

“We’ll- be trying to stop him
(Dorsett) so we can win,.” Welsh
said. “We’ve done_ fairly well
against Dorsett though the years.
If we can hold him down and keep

him from breaking some long ones
, I’ll be happy.’-’ V .  A.
But Pitt» will be out to muster

Dorsett all the support they can
give him as well as avenging last

year’s defeat. "Comjng off an’

impressive 36-19 victory over
Miami, the Panthers will be more

Ye wcic Gets Opportunity  

‘BY, STEVE SYBERT

When Tom Yewcic ﬁrst came to
Pitt as a non-scholarship player, he
always had thoughts of someday
being the quarterback and right in
the middle of all the action.

. But the Panthers already had a.

quarterback in steady Billy Daniels,
and later found‘ Robert Haygood
' ’ and Matt Cavanaugh to try and lead
them to the ultimate goal of a
national championship. - So ‘last

week, with Daniels graduated and _

the injuries to Haygood" and
Cavanaugh, Yewcic was not sur-
_‘ prise'd‘when he was given the call by
Pitt head coach Johnny Majors to

‘keep the Panthers?-on tracks until»

Cavanaugh returns to the lineup in
several. weeks.

“I always had the conﬁdence I
could play quarterback, that’s why I
came here,” the 5-11, 181-pound

senior from Conemaugh, I_,’a., says. ,.

i I hung in there for three and a half
years just hoping _I’d get the
' opportunity someday to show what
I've got. - And I finally got it. I don’t
like the way I got the opportunity,
but...” ’
Actually,_ three third-team quar-

Q terbacks were in the running for the ‘

vacancy at the positionvdue to the
loss of Cavanaugh in Pitt’s 27-6 win

. two weeks agodover Louisville at Pitt

Stadium. Along‘ with Yewcic were

fellowtsenior Dave Migliore (5-11, .

180) and freshman Woody Jackson
(6-0, 175). ’ .

“All three had good intelligence
and good pride—pride enough to
not let this team down,” Majors
said of the week’s practice in which
he evaluated the three candidates to
reach a-decision. “But Tom is a
heady -young man. He’s been
through a lot of situations. He’s
been very valuable to ourprogram.
He’s been here‘ three and a half
years without a scholarship and he's
been one of the steadiest guys on
our football.team—having to run
the opposition plays year after year,

I day after day. _

“He’s had his butt knocked; off,
but he's never -«failed to »ge..t.up,
never failed to ‘come back. He’s
always there and he played in JV
games when we needed him,
scrimmages when we needed him,
and just had conﬁdence. Knowing
his background——his Dad was a
coach, his uncle played at Michigan
State (_whom he led to a Rose Bowl
victory before performing in the old
American Football League)-'—he’s
got a lot of good traits and I knew
that before the game.”

After Migliore worked a series
following the injury to Cavanaugh,
Yewcic got an infrequent tasteﬁofo
varsity action and, - ‘though he
struggled with the unfamiliarity of
the situation and a slight shock of.‘
being - THE Pitt ~_quarterback, he.

— usual condition with,

remained undaunted, conﬁdent and '

poised.

“I didn’t expect it,” he said of his ,

call to duty. 3- “When Robert
(Haygood) got hurt, I got a little
nervous.
(Cavanaugh) got hurt, I didn’t_have

1 time to react—I was just in there.”

In the. second half against
Louisville the timing and cohesion
of the offense was only a shade of its
say, a
Haygood or a Cavanaugh at the
helm. But Yewcic had a week/to
work on those problems and hoped
Majors would give him the‘ chance
"to show whathe could really do.

‘ ‘To come from a slower backﬁeld
to a super fast backﬁeld is a big

the veer, the option--in every

"aspect of the game,” Yewcic said.
“But. I lmow._..-,now when..I go to 4

practice, I knew, I, have to- go for a

reason and tli'a€-sto work and make »

myself better, to make myself ﬁt in
withthe rest of the team better, so I
can run the team.” ,

Yewcic adapted well and, though

he didn't sparkle, he did play _

admirably in leading the Panthers
by Miami, 36-19.- In the game,

Yewcic completed two key passes"

for 78 -yards, one a 40-yard pass and
run ‘screen to Dorsett for a
touchdown - and the other a

38-yarder to Corbett: to: -set-Yup '

Otrangeﬂowl Scouts Get

 Juices Flowing Over Pitt  

BY CRIS HALL

Did Ben Benjamin, past president of the Orange Bowl Committee and '_
‘one of two Orange Bowl ‘representatives who watched Pitt’s 36-19 -

defusing of Miami’s Hurricanes Saturday, like what he saw of the
Panther football team?
“Hell, yeah.”

Gene Autrey, president of the Orange Bowl Committee and the other '

man who spent Saturday afternoon in the Pitt Stadium press box while

.. wearing an orange blazer, was a bit less colorful when expressing his

opinion of Pitt’s undefeated Panthers, but just as enthusiastic.

“It was an exciting game, a big win for Pitt,” he said. “It certainly
puts them at or near the top of our list.” .

Is it at the top or is it near the top? Autrey can't say, since any
statement which could be construed as anything near an invitation
wouldget Autrey and the Orange‘ Bowl in hot water, with the NCAA

. supplying the gas.

So Autrey came as close to saying ‘ ‘We would want un undefeated Pitt
team on Nov. 20" as he could. V

“Pitt’s in an excellent position,” he said. “We (the Orange Bowl-)
have a history of picking and getting the top teams in the country.”

If Michigan should lose and the Panthers rise to the top, would they be ~

a good choice for the Orange Bowl?‘

-“We would be happy to get the highest-ranked team available.”

If that statement istrue, then an undefeated Pitt team would play in
the Orange Bowl.

_If Michigan loses and Pitt moves into the No. 1 spot, they’d obviously . _ '-

be the best team available. .

If Pitt remains behind Michigan, they still will be the highest-ranked
team available, since Michigan would also have to be undefeated and,
therefore, would play in the.Rose Bowl as Big Ten champion.

The only team that could possibly catch and pass an undefeated team
from behind would be Nebraska or Oklahoma, both unbeaten. But in

order to catch Pitt, the Cornhuskers or Sooners would have to win the Big .

Bight, which would give them an automatic Orange Bowl berth.
, So, it appears, if Pitt can defeat its next five opponents, and thereby

retain its present ranking, the‘pos_t-season will be “one big bowl of '
W M A ' oranges,” as J .C. Wilson put it‘, for the Panthers. " 3 “-  '- "

If Pitt of offered an invitation by the Orange Bowl, they most certainly I
' will accept. The Orange Bowl check is the biggest one available to"
Pitt—$1,000,000 in cash, before expenses—and that would make the '

administration happy. V »
And Miami isn't the worst place to spend the last week of December,
and that is what will attract the votes of the players, many of whom hail

from Miami and Florida. In fact, ‘ ‘it's the only place to go,-’ ’ according to

  Ailing Polo Men Split

BY STEVE SYBERT

Pitt water polo coach Miguel
Rivera hopes the Michigan Invita-
tional does not turn out to be an
annual affair. And if it does, you

can count on at least one R.S.V.P. to,

be missing.

“They should have called it the
tournament of disappointment,”
‘said Rivera after the ﬁasco, which
was marred by poor ofﬁciating, in
the opinion of not just Pitt, but of
several of the teams involved.

Playing without one of the team’s
top scorers, Jorge Machicote, who
missed the trip to Ann Arbor
-__because of an infection, the
Panthers won twice in four
appearances to make their record
stand at 7-3 (still 5-0 in the
Mid-Atlantic Water Polo Confer-
ence). V .

Right from the start, Pitt was in
for trouble. With 100 fouls called
-against the Panthers in their game
with Texas A & M, the eventual
tourney winner, resulting in the loss
of ﬁve players, the absence of
Machi’c<')te;. and an ailment to
another top goal getter, Luis Tom,
who played far below his ability, but
‘still managed to tally 13 goals in the
tourney; Pitt fell to the best of the
southwest, 28-16, last Friday.”

Texas A & M, which drew only 40

’ fouls, capitalized on the ofﬁciating

to pour in 20 goals on penalty shots,

‘, while Pitt managed only four. In _

regular goals, the Panthers out-
scored. the Aggies, 12-8. The
scorers_ for Pitt included Toro, nine

' ‘goals; Butch Silva, three; and Mike
' Mere, Jose Santiago, Peque Rolan,

and Mike Schoefield, one each.
“It was a good game on the part
of'1‘exas A & M," Rivera conceded,
though the contest was marred by
bad officiating. “They played well,
but we didn’t play up to our ability.
'l‘hey’re' Very fast. They came in
second in the Northern California
Invitational to Stanford who is a

' national power.

"We were going to cancel the

meet, " continued Rivera, reflecting

on his team's performance without
Machicote leading the way, “but we
had a team meeting and the guys
still wanted to go and play polo. We
were not able to play up to our
potential. Machicote is our team
leader." '

The loss of Machicote was not the
only problem, though. Only one
hour after the Texas A & M
disappointment, tournament direc-
tors scheduled the Panthers against
another toughie, Loyola, and Pitt
lost, 21-9, drawing the ire of Rivera
and his players. »

“We were not ready," Rivera
said. “The team was really down
and really upset over the referees,

because we knew we had three more ‘

games with the same refs. And to
play with a one hour break--we were

.never told about this--it really
affected us. This was our worst
game of the tournament.”

Silva led Pitt with four goals
‘against Loyola, but the Panthers
.could manage only two as a team,
both by Santiago, in a 2-0 win over

Kentucky on Saturday. Kentucky,
like Pitt, was disgusted with the
officiating and even considered
dropping from the competition after
losing their first two games.
But later Saturday, three hours
this time, the Panthers finally put
things together in a 16-14 conquest
of Southern Methodist, in which
Rolan tallied five goals; Santiago
‘and Silva, three; Toro, two; Mere
and Barry Ford, one. The win gave
Pitt fourth place in the seven-team

“I really hate to blame the

Pitt Spikers “Fantastic” In

Edinboro State Tournament

BY JOHN FINN

“After the match, no one was
sure that the best-team had -won.”

Pitt volleyball coach Mike Hebert

That seemed to b_e the concensus
-of the coaches, the players and the
spectators after Edinboro State
defeated Pitt at the Edinboro State
College volleyball tournament" on
Saturday.

Hebert described his team’s
effort as “fantastic" as the
Pantherettes swept through round-
They defeated State-
University of New York (SUNY) at
Fredonia, 15-1 and 15-9; SUNY at
Binghamton, 15-1 and‘15-10; and
Clarion, 15-0, before losing 15-9.

After drawing a bye in quarter-
finals, the Pantherettes faced

SUNY at Fredonia again and

defeated them, 15-10 and 15-6, in
the semi-ﬁnals. This set up the

-Edinboro State-Pitt confrontation,

one Hebert described as one of the
finest women’s matches he _ has
ever seen.

The Pantherette spikers dropped

the first game of match 15-10. ‘In-

that game, Pitt lost one if its key
players, freshman" Cindy Cham-
bers, with a hyper-extended elbow.

But Hebert’s scrappy spikers

‘rebounded to win the second game,’

15-11.

Edinboro outplayed the Panther-
ettes in the ﬁnal contest, but they
certainly didn’t outclass them.
After being down 11-4, Pitt came
backand cut the lead to two, 14-12,
before losing.

“This_was our first true taste of
-top-notch competition,” Hebert
said-, “and I think we played" very
well. We use eight players

regularly and ﬁve are freshman. I .

don't think we_'ve begun to realize

our full potential.” ' '
Next week, the I ‘Pantherettes

travel to a 16'-team tournament at

.the University of Delaware. Once

again, Pitt will face some of the
best teams in the East. A favorable
showing could sew up a bid to
Eastern Regionals‘ next month.

Pitt Chars Chatham, 6-1

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The Pantherette ﬁeld hockey
team crushed Chatham College
yesterday, 6-1, on Pitt’s ho‘me ﬁeld.
Led by left inner Cindy DiGia-
como’s four.goals, the Pantherette
offense made its best showing of the
season. Chatham (0-4) was much
improved since ’ their previous
contest . with Pitt when the
Pantherettes won, '5-0, but Pitt
dominated the game defensivley,
allowing only three shots on goal.

“To have a’ young man like Tom
Yewcic, who has had very little
recognition if any, to see what
.he has done for. our program is
-incredible,” Majors said. “I never
had a quarterback in 20 years of
coaching that went in under those
circumstances, and to see him
_respond, to see him ‘show conﬁ-
dence and not make any mistakes
was a very ﬁtting compliment to
him.” ”

Pitt’s quarterback hunting may
be over, but Panther hunting, by
the opposition has just begun.

announced that it will switch from
its regular football telecast on

‘In the early going, Pitt had no

offense got into scoring position

am matched the "point when center

"Pantherettes led, 4-1, at the half.

The second half lacked the actioii

few trips into Pantherette territory
and only twice did they get close

in the half and, with three minutes
left, Sue Swick slammed the ﬁnal
point into Chatham’s unguarded

A goal cage.

Pitt had 18 shots on goal,
shooting 33%. ' ‘ _

“I think we played better this
time than during our ﬁrst match
with Pitt,” said Chatham coach
‘Kristy Wazzinski. “We score'd our

A line-up,

ﬁrst goal of the season—that made
usfeel good.-”

“It was a nice open game,” said
Pitt coach Janet McDowell. “We
used both sides of the ﬁeld equally
well.”

McDowell praised most of her
particularly DiGiacomo
who is the team’s leading scorer
with‘ nine points on the season.

“She was very aggressive,

- hustled, and was right there where.
the ball was,” McDowell noted.

“She had good position. /

“Eileen (Flaherty) had good‘

centering,’ McDowell went on,
“and Krup (Carol Krupski) played a
nice game.” A

. As to any difference between the

V two games with_" Chatham, Mc-

Dowell pointedéiut that Pitt’s ball
~movement and?‘ control have im-
proved considerably.

The Pantherettes (4-3) close out
the season Nov. 6 when they travel

.“Didn’t he do a nice job?”

' Majors questioned back at reporters‘

following the game. “Handling
that ball, handing off—he didn’t
make mistakes. He was so happy. I
never saw a kid so happy in my life.

With a young quarterback like Tom ‘

in there, I couldn't have asked for
anything better.

“Under the circumstances, we
have never had a quarterback

than Tom Yewcic did.\”

So Tom Yewcic has made it, no
matter how temporarily. Now the
reporters flock to him. _

.“It’s part of the game,” YeWC1(
said, “but it does feel kind 0
strange though. It’s something I’n
not used to.”

Psychology

Majors

Prominent At Pitt  

‘(Continued from P499 1)
increased 6.3% in the same span of
time——50 graduates in 1965 to 79
graduates in 1976.

‘ ‘The psychology department has
grown to accommodate the increase
of students, but due to tenure and
faculty commitments, those profes-

sors in the department don’t feel it‘

has grown enough,” Marshall said.

Marshall explained the number"

of CAS faculty is fixed prohibiting
the addition of faculty to meet
increasing enrollment in a depart-

nient. Tenure also eliminates the

ﬁring of faculty in departments
where enrollment is dwindling.

Over the last 10 years the
psychology department has in-
creased its faculty by about 20 to a
total of 50 full-time faculty
members. Although psychology
enrollment is now leveling off,
faculty increase still is needed,
McBurney said.

He said due to a lack of University
support, particularly in acquiring
funds, the department ‘is unable to
grow enough to accommodate the
increasing enrollments.

Psychology and other sciences

are the most popular pre-med‘

majors, Marshall said.
