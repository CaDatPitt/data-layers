More to Oakland
farmers market
than making   ‘

proﬁts  

Amy Friedenberger
Assistant News Editor

It’s a little hard to imagine amodeslt’

farmers market set up on a street
that is also ‘surrounded by bars,
businesses andpizza shops.
But that’s what Laura Tsyler
enjoys about it.  _
Tsyler drives two hours from

. Minerva, Ohio, each Friday to come

to _Oakland with her two daughters
to sell her baked goods made from
home. r I . ,

“It’s worth it because I sell a
lot,” said Tsyler. “And besides, I
like Oakland. It’s always alive.”

Tsyler runs one of the several
tents set up every Friday through
Nov. 18 from noon until 4 p.m. on
Sennott Street between Meyran
Avenue and Atwood Street. These
family—owned or independently-
owned businesses strike a balance
between bringing in income and
providing a friendly experience for

"consumers that they couldn’t ﬁnd at

  
 
  
  
  
  
 

most large supermarket chains.

William Lewis of Oakland comes
to the farmers market every week to
buy Tsyler’s cashew crunch bars.

“I love this stuff,” Lewis said.
“It’s like crack!” ,

Tsyler said that business for her
has increased in the past year.

“It’s mostly through word of
mouth,” Tsyler said.

Right beside Tsyler, Ada Miller
of Carrollton, Ohio, sells _items such
as snack crackers, popcorn, pasta
and pickles. She tries to‘ purchase
as many homegrown products as
she can, but she adds different in.-
gredients to “spice it up.”

This is Miller’s ﬁrst year coming
to the Oakland farmers market, and
as the weeks progress and people
hear about what she sells, she said
that her sales haveyincreased.

- When Miller heard about the

’ Tsylers coming to Oakland, bring:

ing in proﬁts and fun experiences,

she decided that she wanted to be
7 a part of that. That kind of growth,

both in individuals bolstering mar-
kets and f;ounding new ones has
been part of a national trend. 4

Library installs resource for potential grad students

Tegan Hanlon
Assistant News Editor

Students preparing for graduate school
entrance exams needn’t look further than
Hillman Library for the most up-to-date
resources. ‘

Student Government Board member
Alex Zimmerman completed his campaign
initiative this summer to consolidate and
update the resources available in the Hill-
man Library for potential graduate stu-
dents.

- Zimmerman teamed up with associate
University librarian Fern Brody to order
ﬁve new graduate resource books and two
eBooks for the Alldred Collection in the
Cup 8: Chaucer Cafe on the ground floor.

Three new preparation books are cur-
rently featured in the library for the GRE,
LSAT and GMAT and two more for the

MCAT and GMAT are on the way. Brody
has also ordered two GRE practice eBooks
that students can ﬁnd on PittCat+.

Brody said the books are on standing
order, so the library will receive immediate
shipment when the publisher comes out
with new editions each year.

While Hillman Library carries a few
older editions of graduate school resource
books, Brody said that Hillman will be
sure to carry. the most up-to-date resource
books in one location.

“The idea is to be up to date, but even-
tually what will happen is you’ll see the
editions printed every year,” Zimmerman
said. “So if the 2011 edition is checked
out, the 2010 will be in the general" col-
lection.” .

Students can check the review books
out for two weeks at a time.

Zimmerman said he crafted the initia-
tive when he served as the chairof SGB’s

academic affairs committee. A student
confronted him about the difficulty of
ﬁnding graduate exam resources in‘ the
library.

Prior to the relocation, Brody said the

books werescattered throughout the li- ‘

brary.
’ “We had some [review books], but spo-

radically, and they -weren’t always the most

up-to—date,” she said.

Chantal Botros, a second-year graduate
student in Pitt’s School of Dental Medicine,
responded positively when told about the
new review books at Hillman.

“Things like that are deﬁnitely benefi— I

cial,” Botros said of the added resources.
She said many of the students in her class

graduated from Pitt undergraduate pro-

grams and that the free study materials

would have served them well. '
Botros said that to prepare for her

Dental Admission Test she signed up for

the Kaplan Review, purchased the Kaplan
books and bought special computer soft-
ware. She took the entrance exam in 2009,
her senior year of undergraduate classes
at Roosevelt University -in Chicago.

Zimmerman hopes the new resources
will save students, like Botros, from pur-
chasing huge amounts of review mate-
rial. T .

“One of the biggest concerns in apply-
ing to grad school is how expensive the
process is. Even just submitting an ap-

. plication can run students well close to

$100,” Zimmerman said. “There are things
Pitt can do resource—wise that will make
applying to grad school less ﬁnancially
burdensome.” . '
Zimmerman said a Library Guide web-
site for students studying for graduate
school is in the works; The guide will list
the eBooks, the call numbers for the gradu-
ate resource books. i:-?:

Farmers< 1

known to be operating in the U.S. Between
2010 and this year, the number of farmers
markets has increased 17 percent.

And even though those at the farmers
market have to adjust to a new time of the
market, they still continue to come each
week. ’ _ 4

In past years, the farmers market was
between 3:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., which
some of the vendors preferred.

Marie Dillner from Dillner Family Farm in

Gibsonia, Pa., has been coming to Oakland

for three years, but she has seen a signiﬁcant I

decline in customers at her tent.

She attributes the lack of business to the
new hours conﬂicting with working hours.

She said that people come during their
breaks, but they tend to purchase more
baked goods, which can hold over until it is
time to go home. Produce tends to be more
difficult to take back to work.

Dillner Farms provides various kinds of

17th Annual

vegetables and fruits organized in baskets.
Dillner comes to Oakland while the own-
ers, her parents, Don and Jane, stay back
at the farm. .

Tsyler, on the other hand, had an almost
completely bare table by 4 p.m.

“The bacon, egg and cheese bread ———I

people come and get that every week,” Tsyler
said. "

’ “It’s hard to ﬁnd a lot of gluten—free food,”
Hitchcock said.

By the end of the day, her table had only
a few items left to choose from.

“You have gluten-free?” a woman
asked.

But when Hitchcock said that her gluten-
free goods were sold out, thedisappointed
woman said that she would be back next
week.‘ I ,

Theresa Clark, who works in Pitt housing,
said that because she has a break around
11:30 a.m., she is able to walk down to the
farmers market to buy some goods before
returning to her shift.

Before buying some rolls from Dino Lo-

cabbage from Dillner’s. I

walked away.

who are from Calab ria, Italy, bake the items
at their bakery, Vibo’s Italian Bakery, in
Brackenridge, Pa.

Banning frats won’t

stop drinking  

Greek life, as any fraternity brother
will tell you, is central to campus
culture. But if developments at
other colleges are any indication,
no tradition is free from censure.
Princeton, a school where
Greek organizations aren’t offi-
cially recognized, recently banned
its incoming class from joining a
fraternity or sorority, partially on

the grounds that they place “ex- '

cessive emphasis on alcohol.” One
week prior to this, the University
of Southern California reminded
its students that pre-rush parties
were forbidden as a result of sev-
eral unseemly incidents — which
included multiple cases of alcohol
poisoning. _

Academia’s increasing stringen-
cy toward the Greeks is reflected
in the pages of several estimable
publications.]ust last week, Cornell
president David Skorton explained
in an impassioned New York Times
op—ed why he prohibited frater-
nity pledging, a practice he deﬁned
as including “the performance of
demeaning or dangerous acts as a
condition of membership.” The de-
cision, he said, was inspired by the
death of a sophomore, who passed

away during one particularly exces- ‘

sive hazing ritual.
The next day, The Chronicle of
Higher Education responded with

_a blog post advocating even more

drastic action —— the elimination of
fraternities altogether. The author,
Laurie Essig, claimed abolishing
the entire institution would send a
resounding, unmistakable message
that Universities are intolerant of
“binge drinking, stupid sex acts and
outright violence.” In other words,
it would be a symbolic gesture as
much as a pragmatic one.

Essig teaches at Middlebury
College, where such measures
have already been enacted. She
acknowledged that illicit behavior
wouldn’t vanish with Greek life,
because even at Middlebury such
excess remains prevalent. Despite
this, she was still conﬁdent that
the ban would change the environ-

_ ment — and the attitudes ——- on

campus. r
As much as we condemn binge

drinking and hazing, we think clos-
ing fraternities — or even disman-
tling their recruitment policies — is

_ only the latest in a series of myopic

attempts to cure collegecampuses
of this seemingly untreatable ill-
ness. In reality, drinking culture is
so entrenched — and so ubiquitous
— that attacking only one facet of
it would ultimately engender little
more than sour feelings.

Fraternities, after all, are a ven-
ue for excessive drinking, not the
catalyst. Whether a college is known
for its raucous parties depends not
on the official status of Greek life,
but rather on the mentality of its
students. This mentality is in turn
dependenton any number of fac-
tors — including the surrounding
environment and campus size.

As for the argument that elimi-
nating fraternities would afﬁrm a
university’s intolerance of illicit
behavior, we believe this is unnec-

essary. Colleges make themselves ‘

perfectly clear on these matters,
through zero-tolerance policies
like Brigham Young’s and police
forces that punish underage drink-
ing, like the Pitt police,

In any case, driving fraternities
off campus would ultimately only
drive them underground. Infor-
mal organizations would develop
in the absence of formal ones, the
same_ alcohol-centric atmosphere
would exist and the‘ drinking epi-
centers on campus would multiply
in secret, outside of University ju-
risdiction.

As disheartening as it is to ad-
mit, drinking is not a fraternity
problem, it’s a college problem ——
maybe even a national problem.
Universities might pursue quick-ﬁx
solutions like banning Greek life,
but culture, as any anthropology

I professor will tell you, is slow to

change. Ultimately, the best solu-
tion might be the least-militant

one: simply educate students I

early on about the dangers of al-
cohol abuse and instill in them an
attitude that promotes modera-
tion for when they’re handed their
ﬁrst drink —— whether that moment
comes in a friend’s basement or a
fraternity house. I

‘THE LYONS DEN

Marriage should be post-college

Kelan Lyons
For The PittNews

    
 

For those of you in serious college
relationships, I’m talking to you.
Heed my words wisely.
Afterreading a recent article on
CNN’s website — “Saying“I do’ while
studying at the ‘U”’ — and doing
some research on my own, I discov-
ered that, according to a 2005 Amer-
ican Council on Education study, 10
percent of undergraduates under 25
are married. In my opinion, that’s
about 10 percent too many.
College, after all, isnot the time
to take your relationship to that lev-
el. You only get so long to stumble
your way to whichever fraternity
house is having their white-trash
bash that night. If you try to do this
when you’re married, then you’ll ﬁnd
yourself in the doghouse for longer ‘
than it took you to decide that special

. _ someone was the person you wanted

to wake up next to everyday for the
rest of your life —- approximately
three months. Plus, who wants to
get married when you can still dance
at raves where scantily- clad strang-
ers shootpaint at you? Still thinking
about taking your relationship to the
next level? Get a tattoo. At least you
can hide that more easily than the

_ emotional trauma of a failed mar-

riage before you’ve reached your
mid—life crisis. ’

If you think your relationship is
different and I’m just the bitter, cyni-
cal ex-boyfriend of one too many
girls, keep in mind that experts tend
to agree with me. Marriage and
family therapist Kelly Roberts told
CNN that couples who marry while
in college take on new responsibili-
ties and ﬁnancial difﬁculties. When

considered along with homework '

and extracurricular activities, these
responsibilities can allow less time
for collegiate engagements, like go-
ing out with your friends and go-
ing to sporting events. While these
might not seem like extraordinarily
important activities if you feel hope-
lessly in love, this is the last time
you’ll be allowed to enjoy them with-
out having to run it by your husband
or wife.

Moreover, The National Marriage «

Project’s “The State of Our Unions”
(2010) report suggests that couples
who marry before 25 are more sus-
ceptible to divorce. Roberts, as well,
says that the closer to 30 people are
when they marry, the higher the
probability that their marriage will
be successful. This is presumably
because, alongside the aforemen-
tioned reasons, the’ longer that you

wait to get married, the more wis-
dom and experience you have with
relationships, and the easier you
ﬁnd it to adjust to marriage life. In
other words, you’re so acclimated
to the inevitable irrational ﬁghts
that you’re better prepared tobear
them with one person for the rest
ofyour life.

' Think about all your past roman-
tic quarrels. Do you really think you

would have been able to have longer- ’

lasting ﬁxture relationships had you
not had these arguments with ex-boy
and -girlfriends? The immaturity

' and stubbornness that all of us show-

case in our ﬁrst relationships better
prepare us for later partners. You are
doing neither you nor your ﬁance

' any favors by launching into a mar-

riage this early, as you have likely not
yet developed the wisdom, patience
and communication skills that are so

necessary for a marriage.

Bradford Wilcox, director of The
National Marriage Project at the Uni-
versity of Virginia, theorizes that
getting married in college is a form
of rebellion. Previous generations
engaged in activities like adultery
and premarital sex to act out, while
ours is using an institution that was
once considered a serious, lifelong
commitment. My advice: If you’re

attempting to be rebellious, try
getting to the top of the Cathedral
of Learning or climbing on the di-

nosaur statue outside the Carnegie ‘

Complex — not jumping into some-
thing that could potentially affect
you for the rest of your life. Marriage
is a beautiful engagement based on
trust, love and maturity. Don’t ruin
it by rushing into it for the purpose‘
of rebellion or as the result of ill-
advised thinking.

None of this is meant to suggest

Marry late, be happier

that you should immediately end all
-ties with those you consider impor-
tant in your life. This is simply meant
to convince you that delaying en-_
gagement in your immediate ﬁxture
may lead to a more successful, happy
marriage in the long-term.

So, relax and enjoy your time-

with_your friends and signiﬁcant
other and save the serious stuff for
later. Keep in mind that ideally, you
should be growing old with your
spouse, not growingup with them. I

To the Editor,

Recent revelations about the
syphilis experiments conducted in
Guatemala from 1946 to 1948 have
called into question the ethics of
Thomas Parran Jr. for whom the
Graduate School of Public Health’s
Parran Hall is named. According
to aJune.12 article in the Pitts-
burgh Post—Gazette, Parran knew
that Dr. John Cutler, a researcher
with the U.S. Public Health Ser-
vice who would later become a
professor and acting clean at Pitt,

was deliberately infecting healthy
Guatemalan people with syphilis
without informing them or re-
ceiving consent so they could be
test subjects in his experiments.
Parran was also Surgeon General
during the Tuskegee Syphilis
Study,~in which poor black men
in Tuskegee, Ala., were never told
they had syphilis and were denied-
treatment for it so the progression
and spread of the disease could
be studied. The Tuskegee study
continued for 40 years until a
whistle—blower revealed its mor-

ally indefensible nature.

Both President Clinton and
President Obama have con-
demned and apologized for the
unethical experiments. Pitt and
GSPH administration should re-
view Parran’s role and evaluate
the wisdom of naming a building
in his honor.

FILM REVIEW

Unbalanced  still. captivates with narrative

Patrick Wagner
Staﬁ"Writer

“Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of A
Tribe Called Quest” _

Starring: Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Ali Shaheed
Muhammad, Jarobi White

Directed by: Michael Rapaport

Grade: B+

Around the time gangsta rap brought an
image of anarchy to the nation’s mind, an-
other set of Djs and MCs from New York City
created a different realization of hip—hop’s
message —— this one focused on afrocentric
creativity. -

Michael Rapaport’s documentary chron-
icles the most prominent of those groups, A
Tribe Called Quest — composed of Queens-
natives Q—Tip, Phife Dawg, Ali Shaheed Mu-
hammad and Jarobi White —— on its rise to
fame, dissolution and eventual reuniﬁcation
based on an indestructible friendship.

The ﬁlm is riveting, but while the ﬁrst half
features spectacular cinematography and
interviewing, the lacking second half looks

‘ like an ordinary documentary, chronicling

events as they happen, lacking the rich visual

and story of the beginning.

When the group members released their
ﬁrst album in 1990 — an opportunity made
possible through their membership in a loose
collective known as the Native Tongues .—
they created a sound that blended the musical
history of black Americans with a cultural
consciousness of what was happening in the
America of their day. i _

They rapped about their skills, their pas-
sions and their lives in New York City like few
had before. Over jazz basslines and a sample
of Lou Reed’s “Walk on the Wild Side,” the
quartet helped to create the foundation for
hip-hop as it is today. '

Each biographical section reveals a little
more about not just Tribe’s history, but the
four personalities involved. Quickly, a rift
emerges between the Type A Q—Tip and Type
B Phife, eventually leading to an eight-year
breakup of the group. It was only eventually

remedied by the other members’ desire to

help Phife get through some tough times, such
as his struggles in dealing with diabetes.
Musicians ranging from the Beastie Boys
to Common and Santigold were inspired by
Tribe’s adherence to it’s individuality., and
they share commentary in support_of the
group through interviews that thankfully
don’t verge on Behind the Music—style ado-

ration. ~

Althoughthe content packs an incredible
story, it’s the cinematography that really takes
this documentary to the level a group like
Tribe deserves. The playful visual style feels
both mythical and hyper-realistic, contrast-
ing the colorful buildup of the band’s psy-
chedelic Afro-inﬂuenced album art with the
admitted imperfection of the contemporary
personalities involved; »

While the ﬁlm is perhaps one of the best
to be made about hip -hop in recent memory,
it feels a bit unbalanced. The beginning is
packed with many of the visuals and what

— seems like the majority of the interviews,

leaving the “as it happens” second part feel-
ing a bit sparse. Though the 98-minute run-
ning time helps prevent the ﬁlm from verging
into redundancy, the length does make the
change in pace more noticeable. And while
the second section shouldn’t be discounted
in the least, but the inconsistency in visual
style — more documentary in the second
half — did not connect the past and present
secctions effectively. .

A captivating —— if a bit unbalanced —-
testament to the power of both hip-hop and
friendship, “Beats, Rhymes & Life” should
make it to the top of any music fan’s must-
see list. I ’

Lil Wayne behind on hip-hop after Rikers

Jeffrey Ihaza
Staﬁ Writer

Tha Carter IV

Lil Wayne

Cash Money Records/Universal Mo-
town -

Rocks like: You just got out of jail
Grade: B-

In the ﬂurry of mix tapes preceding Lil
Wayne’s 2008 release Tha Carter III, New
Orleans—born artist Lil Wayne solidiﬁedhis
position as the best rapper around. That
was 2008. And if Lil Wayne’s eight-month
stint on Rikers Island did anything, it made
him ignorant of the enormous amount of
progress his genre has experienced.

In the three years since Carter II1’s release,

' Lil Wayne protege Drake redeﬁned hip-hop,

incorporating indie music sensibilities into
the genre. Then Kanye West redeﬁned the

genre again with My Beautiﬁil Ddrk Twisted
Fantasy. And only this past summer, a kid
who calls himself “The Creator” turned the

genre on its head. Lil Wayne’s latest hip-hop v

endeavor — let’s just ignore that whole rock
music period he had — completely ignores
three years of genre growth and instead- relies
on the same tricks the rapper has always
used.

Of course, this isn’t to say that Wayne isn’t
arguably still one of the greatest rappers of
all time. Even on this album’s weakest tracks,
Wayne still manages to outperform many of
his competitors. Tracks like “Blunt Blowin”’
still ﬁnd the self-proclaimed Martian dishing
outlandish punch lines and T-shirt-worthy
sentiments. The album’s shining moment,
“She Will,” a ballad featuring Young Money
heir Drake, ﬁnds Wayne making the sexual
acquisition of a stripper a relatable experi-
ence.

None of the songs on the album are partic-
ularly bad, but radio-friendly“‘How to Love,”

comes very close. The problem with Carter
IV is that none of the album’s tracks seem ﬁt-
ting for someone who was once unanimously
regarded as the greatest rapper alive.

If it were still 2008, Lil Wayne’s v Tha

Carter IV would be the album of the year. .

Unfortunately for Wayne, it’s 2011, and the
music is simply different. Wearing skinny

- jeans and skate shoes used to make a rapper

cutting-edge, now it is just another cliché.
Rap super group The Throne embraced the
times on‘ their most-recent endeavor by en-
listing Odd Future singer Frarik Ocean on
several tracks as well as by sampling dubstep
hits. Lil Wayne’s
resistance to
these nuances
causes him to
fall just short
of that “king of
hip-hop” title he
once held. I

Black Pussy playsretro
rock ’n’ roll with On Blonde

Patrick Wagner
Staff Writer _
On Blonde
Black Pussy
Made in China Records

Rocks Like: Eagles of Death Metal, Black
Angels, Rolling Stones
Grade C+

Thanks to the ascetic-rock cool of Black
Pussy’s debut album On Blonde, the sound-
track for high school art rooms might just
have changed. Named Black Pussy after

what was supposedly the original title of the .

Rolling Stone’s “Brown Sugar,” the sextet’s
sound seems to bridle that image of rock
‘n’ roll excess with metallic guitars, driving
rhythms and lyrics about weed, girls and the
darkened desert. ' ._

The sound is pure retro, but touches on
modernity with a carefully planned rhythm
and guitars that occasionally jet into post-
Hendrix extremes. “Marijuana” and “Can’t
Take Anymore” feel a bit over-the-top
thematically — and musically — but the
restraint on subsequent tracks creates a
tremendous difference.

The female backing vocal on “Ain’t Talkin’
’Bout Love” is haunting and lends a lingering
dimensionality to the band’s sound. “Indi—
ana,” the ﬁnal track, even slows things down
and speaks in a sentimental tone. _

The ﬁnished product is often ridiculous,
but it’s still rock ‘n’ roll, isn’t it‘? The band’s

dark, offensive visuals are completely at A‘

home in the songs listed above. On Blonde
is rebellious and sentimental in the way a
great rock record should be, but rarely does
it seem to tie the two themes together with
great success. -

Although the sounds seem to be present,
the focus needs some adjustment in order to
make On Blonde the d‘esert-bohemian classic

it was meant to be. I

 

SlaveAmbient hypnotizing

Natalie Bell
Magazine Editor _
S/ave Ambient V
The War On Drugs‘
Secretly Canadian

Rocks like: an easy-listening Pavement
Grade: B-

S/czve Ambiem‘ is a reﬁned version of The War
On Drugs’ brand of throwback rock melded
with bluesy touches to create an immediately

likable album that ﬂows smoothly from one ‘

song to the next. I

The album kicks off slowly and gently with
“Best Night” —- the song begins with light,
fast percussion, progresses with quietly driv-
ing guitars and ﬁnally adds lead singer Adam
Granduciel’s gravelly, Dylan—esque vocals. Its
intricacy keeps the track from being boring
and eases in the listener with its subdued
tones. 4

Throughout the album, the band main-
tains its strong guitar, with a noticeable dif-
ference between the rock songs and the more
blues-inspired ones. A fondness for progres-

sive beginnings and drawn-out, decrescendo ‘

endings tends to keep the songs from crashing
into one another disharmoniously and Gran-
duciel’s unhurried vocals act as a continuing
thread throughout the album, but there are
still distinct changes between songs.

“I Was There” has a meandering piano in

the background, punctuated by the cries of
an electric guitar and a harmonica. The slow
pace gives Granduciel’s voice awhiny, molas-
ses quality that sometimes comes across as
mumbled but generally marries well with the
tones of the song. But “Your Love Is Calling My

Name,” which comes immediately afterward, -

shifts to faster, more drum—driVen rock with
a fortunately slow start to keep from clashing
with the previous song, and the singing ties
them together.

i The band is fond of long stretches of hyp-
notizing instrumentation. Sometimes this
works out splendidly, as in “The Animator.”

“The Animator” is 2:17 minutes of tran-
quil synthesizer and horns before melding
seamlessly into the more exciting “Come to
the City.” It’s a mesmerizing track that acts as
a prelude, and it falls into the band’s dreamy
aesthetics. . A '

But other times, the instrumentation can

drag on.

“City Reprise” is a 3:06 minute instru-
mental jam that crescendoes into repetitive
drumbeats and organ chords that can get to be
a bit much. The 3:09 minute “Original Slave”
is only slightly better. They might mesh well
with the entire album, but they can become
monotonous. '

It’s a strong musical complexity coupled
with smartly mixed songs that make S/ave
Ambient an enjoyable and listenable album.

Panthers have a tough road

 

 

Dadija Bliudziusl For the Pitt News

A Midﬁelder Katie Ruhe pushes the tempo for Pitt. The senior is focused on‘thel team improving fast.

Donnie Tasser
Staﬂ’ Writer

This Friday, the University of Pitts-
burgh women’s soccer team will test
their mettle against some stiff com-
petition on their home ﬁeld.

In this year’s Pitt Soccer Classic,
which begins on Friday ats p.m, Penn
State will square off against North
Carolina State to see who will make
the ﬁnals and play against the winner

. ofthe 7:30 p.m. game, which features

Pitt against Colorado College. The
Championship game will be played at
2 p.m. on Sunday, with the consola-

» tion game slated for 11:30 a.m.

‘FIt’s going to be a challenge for
sure; we set our schedule up that
wayg” head coach Sue—Moy Chin said.
“The games are going to be tough and
we need to step up.”

Penn State enters the weekend
sporting a 3-1 record. Despite the
season opening with a rough 4-0
defeat to No. 2 Stanford, the Nittany
Lions have ripped off three consecu-
tive multi-goal shutouts, blanking
Nevada 4-0, West Virginia 5-0 and

Richmond 3-0. The Nittany Lions .

are led by Maya Hayes, who has four
goals on the year. Following her are
Taylor Schram andjess Rosenbluth,
who both have two goals and two
assists. . '

North Carolina State enters the
tournament undefeated at 4-0 after
displaying stellar defense and goal-
keeping thus far. They have three,1-0

_ victories on their record, -including
wins over Virginia Commonwealth, ,

Navy and LSU. Their third victory
over Old Dominion went to overtime,

before the Wolfpack exploded for 3 A

goals to seal a 4-1 victory. The Wolf-
pack is led by standout goalkeeper

S Kim Kern, who sports a miniscule

.26 goals—against average and a .950
‘save percentage. ‘

Colorado College limps into the '

tournament with a 1—3record after
defeats at the hands of the Univer-
sity of Colorado (5-0), University of

. Denver (2-1) and Utah State (2-1).
Their only victory was a 1-0 shutout ’
3 ofjacksonville State. ‘

Pitt enters with a 1-2-1 record.
They opened the year with a 2-0 loss
to_Ohio University and a 2-2 (2 OT) tie

,  Eastern Michiganbefore they
participated in the James Madison

Invitational this past weekend. Their
6-0 loss tojames Madison came be-
fore winning their ﬁrst contest of the
year, a 1-0 victory over Delaware.

Pitt will spend this week in prac-
tice improving on aspects they found
lacking in their tournament over the
weekend.’ _

“This week will be hard,” senior
midﬁelder Katie Ruhe-said. “We will
focus on a lot of things we did wrong
over the weekend, like one-V-one
defending and clearing balls out of
our zone.” _

Coach Chin addedto that, saying
“We did good organizing our back
four with our midﬁelders on Sunday,
but we need to continue to be sound
defensively and dangerous attackers."
We will work on getting our person-
nel sorted, on one-v-one situations,
attacking the ﬁnal third and getting
to the goal.”

Junior Ashley Cuba offered a
much simpler approach.‘

“We just need to keep our heads,”
she said. “We need to play with our
instincts and stop thinking so much.
We’re a young team and we just need '
to keep our focus -and continue im-
proving.” Q ~

There is no denying the fact

is also no denying the fact that he

as much as he is loved by those
in Denver and Florida. It is obvi-

the question is, for how long? The
Broncos aren’t very good, and while
Orton has a pretty good record as a
starter, he has always been relied
upon as a Trent Dilfer-type — not a
quarterback that can actually carry

Gabler: Good things ahead

Dustin Gabler
Staff Writer

College football season is ﬁnally here.
Whether you have been a Pitt fan since
birth or just picked up your ﬁrst Pitt shirt
last week when you stepped on campus,
Heinz Field is about to be very different
on Saturdays.

After a confusing and sometimes dis-
appointing offseason for the Panthers,

coaching turmoil ended inlthe Pitt ad~ '

ministration making a big commitment
to the football program. .

In fact, the Pitt administration made
their ﬁrst major commitment to the foot-
ball program since Jackie Sherrill left in
1982, ponying up big money for Todd

  e   55 y  
Looking at the schedule, it seems like

past offseason.

At the very least, the Big East is win-
nable this season.

West Virginia is just sneaking into the
AP poll at 24. With only four defensive
starters‘ returning, the Mountaineers
might not be able to stop anyone.

With Texas Christian University enter-
ing the Big East in 2012 (along with the
end of the world), this may be the last
year that Pitt has to win the conference
rather easily. TCU will be agperennial Top
25 team in a conference struggling to ﬁnd
a leader in the pack. '

. 2011 is also a huge year in Pennsyl-
vania recruiting for Coach Graham and
company. A lot of big—time prospects are

still interested, and they will be watching ‘

intently to see how the team performs.

an easy trip to the BCS Championship

in New Orleans.

Graham.

The 2011 season gives Pitt fans young
and old a chance to put away all the bad
memories and look at this year in anew
light.

“We want Myers!” chants will be annoy-
ing, especially coming from upperclass-
men who shouted “We want Tino!” during
Bill Stull’s senior season as the Panthers’
quarterback. ‘

There is no reason to believe this team
can’t win every game.

The old adage of expecting the upset
doesn’t apply. This is a new coach anda
new Pitt football team.

I’ll'admit that I’m the ultimate optimist.
This is something you don’t get a lot from
sports reporters and broadcasters: Most
of them want to rufﬂe feathers to draw
interest.

Looking at the schedule, it seems like
an easy trip to the BCS Championship in
New Orleans — and no’, Megabus doesn’t
offer trips from Pittsburgh to New Or-
leans. I’ve checked. ,

Graham turned" Rice around from 1-10

, to 7-6 in one season. That was after switch-

ing the philosophy from a pro style to his
“high-octane”, no-huddle attack much
like the transition. Pitt went through this

499

' With all of this action revolving around
the 2011 season, it is easy to see why the
Panthers realize they must capture a Big
East title this year.

The conference schedule seriously fa-

-vors Pitt, which hosts four conference
games. In total, Heinz Field crowds will ‘

see the Panthers in-person eight times
this«sea_so__n.  _, ~ L I _ V

That is anumber that isn’t likely to be
touched again in,tl_1e,near future.

A trip to Iowa. looks daunting before

you realize that they return 10 starters,
tied for second—last in.FBS football behind A

only defending champ Auburn University
with seven.  ‘ . _

N otre Dame carries clout, but still
hasn’t shown they are the powerhouse the
media would like them to be. Considering
the facts that Graham defeated Brian Kelly
with Tulsa last year and he will roll out a
much more talented team this time, it’s not
a bad gamble to bet on the Panthers.

All in all, Pitt has the schedule to run
the table and rekindle football in Oak-
land. ’ '

Don’t take my word for it, though — I
say this every year. Watch this team im-

Don’t expect to see any undefeated teams this year

(a downside of being so good: No
one ever throws to you). The best-
case scenario for the Eagles is that
they shut down everyone’s pass-
ing game and lead the league in
turnover ratios, although that also
depends on which Mike Vick shows
up. Worst-case scenario? Egos get

undefeated. As for Alabama, it’s
too hard to go undefeated in the
SEC, so they’re out. They have the
best chance, but I smell a revival in
SoCa1, so I’m going to say no. LSU
will lose to Oregon in week one,
Boise State will steamroll through
their conference, ﬁnish the regular
season undefeated, blow up the
BCS and all of the mid—major die-

hards will cry tears of joy. Then,
when Boise gets blown out in the
National Championship game by

' a one—1oss SEC team on the big
stage away from their comfy blue .:

turf, those tears of joy will turn
