Professors understand — sometimes

By Kirin Kalia
Staff Writer

(Editor's note: This is the second part of
a two-part series on skipping class.)

My professors must think I spend all
my time studying.

He thinks his class is most important.

Doesn’t she understand I’m working
30 hours a week?

While students may think professors
don’t live in the real world, they usually
understand the other forces in a student’s
life.

“Any professor realizes that going to
class is one of many things that students
do. The course is more important to me
than to any student in it,” said English
department faculty member Chris
Rawson. “My job is to make class inter-
esting and important enough so that peo-
ple want to come.”

Rawson has taught at Pitt for over 30
years and doesn’t pay attention to excus-
es anymore. “Let’s just go ahead from
here,” is his attitude, he said.

But when a student knows ahead of
time he or she will not be in class, pro-
fessors like the advance notice.

“Usually they say they were sick and
leave a note in my mailbox or a message

by phone, which I appreciate,” said his-
tory professor Hugh Kearney, who is
team-teaching a special topics course
with Rawson this semester.

Valerie Staats, a Pitt grad and now
adjunct professor with GSPIA, said, “I
look upon coming to class as the bare
minimum you can do. If you’re not here,
you don’t get it.”

As an undergraduate at Pitt in the
1970s, Staats waitressed at night to pay
for school. She understands students

have other commitments.

“Even knowing that [they have other
things to do], in order to best benefit,
students should come to class.”

Staats uses her own experience as a
student to illustrate her point. “I used to
crave hearing the professors’ off—the—cuff
comments. I learned more from those
than anything else. Suggestions of things
to read, places to go — note—takers don’t
take these things down. You miss a lot of
informal knowledge-sharing.”

Maria Peterson of LSC sees some stu-
dents’ attendance problems in terms of
over-commitment and poor time man-
agement.

“They put these time commitments
ahead of going to class and figure they
have time to catch up,” she said. But
somehow, that ‘catch-up’ time doesn’t
always materialize.

“It’s a question of what kind of analy-
sis you’re going to use,” Staats said. “If
you use the market analysis, you say
‘I’m a consumer, I pay tuition, I’1l
decide what I’m going to do.’ In a mar-
ket society, a lot of people are going to
argue that way.”

The other side of the argument, said
CAS senior Mike Fuller, is getting your
money’s worth out of your education.

”Keepingsfudenfs at Piftmade top priority

By Jackie Duggan
Asst. News Editor

Over 2,000 surveys will
be sent out to undergradu-
ates in an effort to find out
how satisfied they are with
Pitt. It is part of Provost
James Maher’s latest effort
to keep students at the uni-
versity.

“The provost has told the

Deans Council he is mak-
ing student retention one of
his top priorities,” said
Jack Daniel, vice provost
for academic affairs.

The survey, sent out this
week, asks current under-
grads to evaluate all aspects
of university life and rate
what they think needs
improvement.

“We need students to be

responsive to the survey,”
Daniel said. “It’s our effort
to be proactive as apposed
to reactive in the area of
student retention.”

The survey is random and
will be sent to on- and off-
campus students. Of the
2,100 surveys sent, 620
will go to sophomores, and
the remaining will go to
students across the other

four years.

“We are sending more to
sophomores, because they
will be here longer,” Daniel
said. “Over the long term,
we have to pay immediate
attention to their retention.”

Although usually associ-
ated with adults and part-
time students, Daniel said
700 surveys will also go to

Distinguished Teacher
named vice provost

By Julian Neiser
Senior Staff Writer

Hoops are comin '....

After 20 years as a University of Pittsburgh faculty
member, Beverly Harris-Schenz will be promoted to vice
provost for faculty affairs on Jan. 1, 1996.

The former Chancellor’s Distinguished Teaching‘ Award
winner has been an associate professor of German and
director of language studies in the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences since 1991.

She was also the assistant dean in the College of Arts
and Sciences from 1980-1985, and is a member of an advi-
sory committee on undergraduate programs, the CAS
council and a faculty advisory board.

The position Harris-Schenz will occupy is designed to
assist other professors with improving their teaching and
information-gathering abilities.

Provost James Maher, who made the announcement of
Harris-Schenz’ appointment last week, said her experience
and ability make her the ideal person for the job.

“She has an outstanding reputation as both a teacher
and as an organizer,” Maher said. “She is the ideal person
to create a supportive atmosphere for the faculty to devel-

students.

“The key is that we know
what the students want to
improve student life,”
Daniel said.

Questions on the survey
deal with a variety of
issues, including academic
advising, registering for
classes, quality of instruc-
tion, meal plans and campus
security.

The survey was designed
by James Ritchie, director
of institution research and
the Enrollment Management
Committee, which focuses

on all aspects of undergrad— _,
uate recruitment, retention’

and graduation.

The results of the survey
will be used to develop an
action strategy to prevent
students from leaving Pitt
because they are dissatis-
fied, Daniel said.

“We hope to collect
enough information to cre-
ate a retention alert system
to prevent students from
leaving,” Daniel said.

Daniel encouraged any
student or organization that
does not receive a survey to
write to his office.

“I want to hear from as
many students as possible,”
Daniel said.

More than murder

 OK, relax. Breathe in. Now exhale. Repeat this process. You’re

going to be just ﬁne, you are simply experiencing withdrawal symp-
toms. You just have to face the facts — the O.J. trial is over. Get 0

Well, the so—called trial of the century finally ended yesterday,

 [ with your life. ‘

' I somewhat anti-climactically. O.J. was found not guilty of all charges,

and orange juice companies won’t have to change the name of their
product to Citrus Jubilee or anything.

trial served at least one good purpose. The issue of domestic violence
has finally been brought back to the forefront by the O.J. trial, and it
needs to stay there.

You might remember hearing tapes of Nicole Brown Simpson
when she called 911. That call was made when her husband, O.J.

 

3...-

Simpson, tried to attack her. The tape was allowed to be played to the

  O.J. jury, and the prosecution claimed that O.J.’s history of domestic‘

violence might suggest he had the ability to kill.

Even though the jury found that O.J. did not kill in this case, the
prosecution brought up several valid points. Simpson had attacked
his wife several times, physically assaulting her. But he was only
arrested once because his wife had severe bruises.

This kind of thing is nothing new. Nor is it limited to only famous
athletes with a lot of money. Domestic violence has nothing to do
with fame or hero-worship, it has to do with ignorance. People
choose to remain ignorant of domestic violence because it is easier to
ignore than to ﬁx. Police ignore it because they think they can’t stop
it. Bystanders ignore it because they don’t want to be involved, or
because they are still living in the 19th century when abuse was
acceptable. Abusers ignore it because few people try to stop them.
And victims ignore it because they have been degraded and embar-
rassed by it.

Domestic violence needs to be addressed and curbed. Education

about available options for victims needs to be more prevalent.
I . Prosecution and punishment for abusers needs to be harsher and
more consistently applied (and upheld). Whether you are a football
player, steel worker or unemployed cashier, you need to recognize
that domestic violence is a big problem which needs to be solved.
Maybe then we won’t see another trial like the Simpson trial.

Be more than an X-er

Rightly or wrongly, we college kids have the reputation of being
- lazy slackers who only do it for the money. We are “Generation X,”
after all. Well, now the community needs us. Local hospitals are cur-
rently suffering a blood shortage in type O—negative blood. Some
hospitals have had to cancel surgeries because of the shortage.

_ It appears that the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center is safe
i‘-~.for now, mostly because they rely mainly on patients donating their
, own blood before surgery. But that supply could soon run out, and
" then UPMC patients will run into problems too.

So between classes or during your lunch break or after you’re done
for the day, go out and give blood. The emergency is a shortage
of type 0, but hospitals can always use any type. Take a step
towards helping us lose the slacker ID. -

Anyone interested can call 456-1980 or 1-800-310-9551.

tron now has
its very own version of the
Kennedy assassination. Twenty
years from now, we will be
able to answer the question
“Where were you when you
first heard the news that O.J.
Simpson was acquitted?” Now
that the courts have said that
Simpson did not commit the
murders (although public opin-
ion has yet to concur wholly),
the conspiracy theories about
the true murderer can begin.
Simpson has been cleared of
first and second degree murder,
so there will not another mur-
der trial, although the Goldman
family has a wrongful death
suit against him.

I have said from the begin-
ning that this trial raises impor-
tant questions about this coun-
try and its legal system. This is
not just a media circus. There
are questions that go a lot deep-
er. If we can get past the shlock
media and hack analysis, this
may actually be good for the
country.

One person commented to
me as I sat down to write this,
“They asked moral questions
instead of focusing on the fact
that someone died.” While she
was referring to the defense,
this remark is true of the whole
trial. These moral questions
need to be asked. The verdict

itself did not answer questions .

about the justice system, racism
or wealth as it relates to justice,
or hero worship.

It has brought up a number of
these issues, and if we can get
people to think about them as
opposed to whether or not O.J.
Simpson should be lynched,
then maybe there is some value
to the $9 million or so that the
trial cost.

This is not to say that we
ought to ignore the practical

issues. There are still a few

important questions to be
answered. Who actually did kill
Nicole Simpson and Ronald

Goldman? There are killers on
the loose, whether Simpson is
guilty or innocent. Will the
investigation proceed, or will
the Los Angeles Police
Department let it quietly fade
away?

The issue of the LAPD is
another important pragmatic
consideration. This trial has
changed the atmosphere of

policing in Los Angeles. Police

on the street must now work
with the people, after this trial
suggested they will plant evi-
dence to convict innocent peo-
ple. Mark Fuhrman’s state-
ments and allegations about the
police department were not
entirely admitted into evidence,
but they have come to the
attention of the public. Also,
Fuhrman himself (must be
called on the carpet for perjury.
His statements throughout the
trial were contradictory. Will he
have to face up to this in court?

The less concrete questions
are of more concern. L.A.
District Attorney Gil Garcetti
said that this was a trial for vic-
tims of domestic abuse. He also
intimated that it was fought for
justice and that justice was not
served. With speeches worthy
of accepting an Academy
Award, the rest of the prosecu-
tion continued the media trial.
They have received a black
eye, and must try and save face,
but their statements imply that
the jury system did not grant
justice.

There may very well be
something to this claim. If O.J.
had a public defender, would
he have gotten the same ver-
dict? Can money and celebrity
change the outcome of a case?
Some say yes, and others say
that hero-worship had no part
in it. '

Like many others on this
campus, I took time out of my
day to go to the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room and
watch the delivery of the ver-
dict. The cameras parming the
crowd showed a sign which
read, “We still love you O.J.

guilty or not.” This reveals
something about the reverence
which our society holds for its
sports heroes.

The trial has also changed the
way cases will be tried in the
future. Scientific evidence, pre-
vious reports of domestic
abuse, expert testimony and
jury selection, among others,
will all be affected by this case.
The way juries are instructed
will even change.

How is it that a jury which
has sat for a year can reach a
verdict after deliberating after
only four hours? Their verdict
has changed this country in
ways we have not yet begun to
realize. When thinking about
the verdict, this is an important
question to keep in mind. The
jury has suffered from the
media circus, as we all have,
albeit in different ways. Now,
they will continue to face the
results of their deliberations. It
will be interesting to see if the
content of those deliberations
ever comes to light. Clearly it
will be a much shorter story to
tell than the trial itself. What
went on behind those closed
doors is the only thing we have
to determine whether or not
justice was served. Before it is
all over, we may have some
idea, but the ring of truth will
be hard to hear over the noise
coming from the circus.

As the nation copes with the
fallout from the trial, and tries
to deal with every hack analyst
that puts his two cents in, we
ought to keep in mind some of
these larger questions.
Doubtless, we will see many
point-counterpoints on whether
justice was served and why,
since everyone has become an
expert. But as we try to cope
with the trial replays and
Monday morning quarterback-
ing, we must raise these impor-
tant questions to keep the
clowns from running the circus.

Cut
scholar-
ships, not
teams

‘ti
Athletic
Director
Oval J aynes _
. called it the
“most difficult
.  2 decision” he
Columnist make in 37

Mark years.

Gordon - Assistant
Athletic Director Carol Sprague
said the day she gave the news to
tennis coach George
Dieﬁenbach and gymnastics
coach Frank D’An1ico was her
“all—time worst day.”

Athletes like tennis player
Mike Sullivan and gyrrmast
Keith Youndt, received the news
in a phone call from an assistant
coach or a letter from Pitt.

The news was pretty straight-
forward. The men’s tennis and
gymnastics teams at Pitt would
be disbanded . Taking their place
in 1996 would be women’s soc-
cer. This was done because Pitt
had to comply with the NCAA’ s
Title D{ gender-equity rules.

The move gives Pitt nine
men’s programs and eight
women’s programs, somewhat
evening out the playing ﬁeld.
But total scholarships at Pitt are
still far from even between men
and women, mostly thanks to
J ohrmy Majors and company.

Male athletes should not have
lost their opportunity to compete
just to give women a chance, no
matter what discrimination has
been done in the past. But a
tough decision had to be made,
and that’s why Jaynes gets paid
the big bucks.

’ However, something J aynes
and the NCAA might want to
consider next time is cutting
some football scholarships — 85
scholarships, 22 starters. That’s
an average of almost three back-
ups per position.

Take a close look at Pitt’s
depth chart John Ryan, Pete
Gonzalez, Matt Lyttle, Damell
Dinkins, Leon Murray and Sean
Fitzgerald are all on the roster,
all receiving scholarships, all
recruited as quarterbacks.

Translation: Pitt's number one
tennis player Braden Doherty is
expendable, but not the football
team’s sixth quaterback.

Granted, football players tend
to get injured often; ﬁve games
of Panther football is all you ,
need to know that. But the NFL
survives with a 50-player limit
——- Pitt and the NCAA should be
able to do the same.

Nobody wants to mess with
college football, the ﬁnancial

jewel of the NCAA. Cutting

    

. scholarships is a tough decision.

But it makes a lot more sense
than cutting whole teams.

Chief for The Pitt News.

(Editor’s Note: This is the
first ofa two-part preview
on the Pitt baseball
teamsfall camp.)

The Pitt Panther baseball
team is eager to begin anoth-
er season under head coach
Mark Jackson. They’ll be
coming off their best season
in team history, where they
compiled a 39-16 record and
won the Big East
Championship.

Last spring, they traveled
to Knoxville, Tenn., for the
NCAA regionals, where they
came a few games short of
making it into the College
World Series. They won
their first two NCAA
regional games in school
history before being elimi-
nated by the loaded
Oklahoma State Cowboys.
Three more wins would have
propelled them into the
College World Series.

The team has two intense
practices every day which
mostly involve intersquad
games, giving the players
some early form of competi-
tion. They play a five-week
“season” of intersquad
games and then begin their

kids are working hard,
showing me some commit-
ment. With the level of play
and some of the quality
teams we go up against like
Notre Dame, West Virginia
and Rutgers, we have a lot
of work to do. Our weight
training program and condi-
tioning play an important
role as well.”

Pitt will not be lacking in
experience this year, as
many key players are return-
ing. However, Jackso,rr
emphasized that everyoneon
the team plays an important
role.

Returning starters include
All Big East second-team
outfielders Jason Conti and
Kurt Womelsdorf, junior
first baseman Rob Garvey,
senior catcher Bill Derr,
shortstop Sam Crowley and
outfielder/first baseman Jeff
Murse.

“Everyone on this team
must contribute for this team
to have a successful year,”
Jackson said.

He will look to returning
pitchers Mike Rohrback,
Jason Hoppa and Kevin
Kramer,.to lead the pitching
staff. Leadoff man and out-
fielder Josh Mellor will be
back to provide a spark,

times of the year.

Financial considerations part of Title IX decision

By Nichole Gantshar
For The Pitt News

(Editors Note: This is the third of a four-part

series about Title IX and why the University,

of Pittsburgh dropped menis termis and gym-
nastics, while adding women ’s soccer)

Nothing in Title D( dictates that an athletic
department cut men’s teams to fund
women’s teams. Yet according to the
Women’s Sports Foundation, universities
around the country have developed a pattern
of cutting men’s teams in order to create
opportunities for women.

Under an April 30 deadline to create a pro-
portional number of men’s and women’s
teams, ﬁnances forced Pitt's athletic depart-
ment to cut tearrrs to create women’s soccer.
The lack of additional funds to create an

equal number of opportunities for women

prevented the committee from adding sports.

“If we just had enough money, this
wouldn’t have to happen,” one university
official said regarding the elimination of
men’s tennis and gymnastics.

“The funds saved from eliminating these
two teams will go to fund the new women’s
soccer team,” Oval Jaynes,_ director of athlet-
ics, said. He explained, “that’s why we’re
phasing in the women’s scholarships over a
couple of years. We have to wait until all the
currently funded athletes graduate.”

Carol Sprague, associate director of athlet-
ics, defends Jaynes’ decision. '

“Mr. Jaynes had increased the money for
women’s programs each year, whether it was
scholarships for women’s track, money for
travel  he managed through savings made

elsewhere to improve sports and made sig-
nificant changes that were helpful,” she said.
“Through administrative cutbacks, Jaynes
said in earlier years he protected university
cutbacks from having an impact on our
sports programs.”

Before the athletic departrnent’s decision
to cut two teams, Pitt had 11 men’s teams
and eight women’s teams. The committee
that made the recommendation to cut the two
teams looked at over 33 criteria to make its

board of trustees, we have a strong commit-
ment to perform at the highest level at
Division I-A and to perform successfully,”
said J aynes.

Another option for Pitt was adding three
women’s teams. In a campus survey, women
showed a strong interest in women’s softball
and soccer. .

Sprague explains the committee asked,
“Could we afford to add more ﬁeld space,
more locker room space, to accommodate”

decision. These included the

number of scholarships, the ”The iUl‘|dS saved from

condition of the facilities and

other opportunities the athlet- eliminating these two

ty sport.

Tommorow, The Pitt News the new women’s

story will detail this process

at greater length and describe soccer team.”

how men’s gymnastics
became an early candidate
for elimination.

three new teams. But Pitt
was unable to find funding
to accomplish that goal.

The athletic department
receives a small amount of
revenue from the women’s
basketball, women’s volley-
ball and men’s wrestling
teams. This fact helped pro-
tect these teams. Basketball

and football produce rev-
Oval Jaynes enue to help support their

Director at Athletics programs.

Financial concerns, how-
ever, directed the committee to cut men’s
tennis.

Both Jaynes and Sprague are quick to
defend efforts and achievements of the men’s
tennis team and its coach George
Dieffenbach. Winning was not the issue —
Pitt did not have the money nor space to cre-
ate new tennis facilities. ‘

“We are committed to providing all of our
teams on an equitable basis that they’ve got a
chance to compete and to compete at the
highest level,?’ J aynes said. _

“As a department, and as a university and
as an extension of the administration and the

from its football program to help create
opportunities for women. The Women’s
Sports Foundation suggests the NCAA cre-
ate a 66-player team limit for football. To
defend this proposal, the sports foundation
argues that pro teams operate with a 45-play-
er limit.

At an April 1995 seminar on Title IX com-
pliance, one Division I athletic director stated
he could create $250,000 in funds to create
opportunities for women if he cut 20 football
scholarships. Other activists suggest capping
coaches’ salaries so that they could not be
higher than the highest-paid professor. ’

No university has ever cut‘

pretty excited about the
rookies.

“Adjusting to the system,”
Jackson said, “takes a little
bit of time. They have to
learn a structured system
and face better competition
than they’re used to in high
school.

“Shortstop Lou Melucci
and a few other guys are
doing very well. We’ll defi-
nitely have some of these
guys start some games in the
spring, and they should be
factors on this team.” .

Jackson added there are
also a few walk-ons who
have impressed him so far,
although when the season
starts some will be gone.

“lt’s a lot more difficult to
come in here and walk on
this team than it was say
five or 10 years ago with the’
quality players we have

, coming in.”
