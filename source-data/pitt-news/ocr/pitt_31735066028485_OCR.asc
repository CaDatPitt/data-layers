University of Pittsburgh

Wednesday, November 8, 1995

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

A dozen or so umbrellas pointed up at the
gray sky as a light drizzle trickled down.

Beneath the watery umbrellas, students
stood silently, some shedding tears as they
honored a fallen hero, Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin.

Along with the students, professors and
community religious leaders gathered out-
side the William Pitt Union yesterday at a
memorial service for Rabin, who was
assassinated Saturday.

“In Israel, we are all one big happy fami-
ly, and one of our sons killed our father,”
said a despondent Ira Russ to the grief-
stricken crowd. “It’s just so hard to accept.”

As Russ, a Pitt junior, spoke to the crowd
of approximately 150, a Pitt student in the

front row put his hands over his face and
began to cry.

Some people in the crowd looked up into
the sky, as the light rain continued to fall
and the wind drifted through. Others just
stared straight ahead as people shared their
feelings about the assassination.

Local Rabbi Art Donsky first spoke to
the crowd, and told of his “horror [when]
my wife called me into the t.v. room and I
learned a hero had been shot in cold
blood.”

“Whatever anyone believes about the
peace process, they must know that murder
and violence is not the answer,” Donsky
said.

Pastor Gary Dennis of the First Baptist
Church in Pittsburgh said his prayer is that
new voices for peace will arise.

“We mourn the loss of Yitzhak Rabin at a

time when the world cannot afford to lose a
voice for peace.’-’ _

Two Pitt students read a eulogy that was
given by Rabin’s granddaughter, Noa Ben-
Artzi, -at Monday’s funeral in Jerusalem,
and two other students read poems.

One person who spoke encouraged the
community to become more involved.

“It’s not sufficient to stand here on a cold
wet day, mourn and go home,” he said.
“We must keep going. We must think about
what we can do here in Pittsburgh.”

At the service Donsky presented a letter
that anyone.was welcome to sign before it
was sent to Rabin’s family in Israel.

Rabin was shot during a peace rally in
Jerusalem three days ago. Israeli police
have a man in custody, 27-year-old law stu-
dent Yigal Amir. He told police that he
“acted alone, on God’s orders.”

What the hell is the
Aesthetic Review Board?

By Steve Westrick
Staff Writer

A couple of weeks ago I read an
article in The Pitt News which said
the Aesthetic Review Committee
approves what the recycling bins
look like on campus. It’s something I
can’t explain, but at that moment I
just had to know: what is the
Aesthetic Review Committee?

The problem is that nobody seems
to know. Telefact couldn’t find the
answer. The university operator said,
“What is that? I never even heard of
it, and it’s not listed in any of our
numbers. Is it with the university?”

Through the help of the university
operator I got the lead that it might
be under the Facilities Management
Department and received the number
for Rese Koslof, assistant facilities
manager.

When I called the number of Rese
Koslof, a student who worked in the
office answered the phone.

“It’s a group of architects and engi-
neers that have to approve the colors
of garbage cans on school grounds,”
said the student who asked not to be
named in the article.

When I called Koslof’s office
again, he was there. “I don’t know,”
he said when asked about the

Aesthetic Review Committee.

“Well, actually their job is to make
things look more uniform on cam-
pus.” Koslof says. “They work for
the office of facilities management
and have for years.”

But when asked if I could get any
names of people on the committee,
he answered, “To tell you the truth, I
don’t know who is on it.”

Finally Koslof told me to call the
main office of the Facilities
Management Department. When I
call the office, the secretary there
didn’t know what I was talking
about. After about 15 minutes and
being put on hold seven times, she
gave me the number of Deborah
Rouse, who, she said, is the person in
charge of the Aesthetic Review
Committee. A

I called the office of Deborah
Rouse and the receptionist answered
the phone. “It is not a committee; it’s
a process” said Ann, the receptionist,
who refused to give her last name.

I was connected to Rouse’s office
and asked her what the Aesthetic
Review Committee is." “Where did
you get that idea?” she aksed while
laughing. “There is no committee.”

The aesthetic review, which Rouse
described as a process and not a

to Penn State University for a press conference on
Wednesday.

The purpose of the press conference, covered
by State College NBC and ABC afﬁliates, was to
announce the kick-off of a petition drive aimed at
Gov. Tom Ridge.

The petition, circulating around the campuses
of Pitt, Penn State and Temple, is to encourage
Ridge and other state lawmakers to support higher
education better. It stresses the principle of not

trying to remedy the budget by compromising
education.

Wednesday’s meeting at Penn State had two
purposes. Not only was there a press conference,
but the Association of Pennsylvania State Schools
met for the first time.

chair Jason Getz of Penn State, and two represen-

JERUSALEM Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
gunned down in Israel over the
weekend for forging peace
with hostile neighbors, was
buried in Mount Herzl national
cemetery on Monday while
dignitaries. friends and former
enemies stood at his graveside.

At Israel’s moment of deep-
est grief, a barrage of leaders
joined to mourn, from Jordan’s
King Hussein to Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak,
many of whom once consid-
ered the country to be an inter-
national pariah.

Together, the world leaders,
including Bill Clinton, vowed
that the abrupt end to Rabin’s
life would not be followed by
the same quick end of his
dream of peace in the Middle
East. Pittsburgh Post—Gazette

JERUSALEM — Law stu-
dent Yigal Amir again admit-
ted on Monday to killing
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
and voiced a tirade of defiance
as he stood before a judge for
the first time.

He told the judge he did not
intend to stop the peace
process, because “there is no
such concept as the peace
process. This is a process of
war.”

Refusing a lawyer, he cited
biblical foundations for his
actions and said Rabin was
targeted because he had left
Jewish settlers at the mercy of
armed terrorists in the occu-
pied territories.

He also claimed the shooting
was an act he performed
“alone, but maybe with God.”
Police may think otherwise,
for they arrested Amir’s broth-
er, Hagai, on Sunday on suspi-
cion of involvement in the
killing. Pittsburgh Post-

MANAGUA — A researcher
in a U.S. laboratory unraveled
the cause of a mysterious epi-
demic that has stricken 1,900
citizens in Nicaragua, identify-
ing it as a disease carried by
rats.

The bacterial disease, lep-
tospirosis, has now claimed
the lives of 16 people, most of
them from Achuapa, a town 65
miles northwest of Managua.
Three others died in Honduras.

The discovery that it can
easily be treated with antibi-
otics eased the wide-spread
panic. Some health officials
had feared that the epidemic
marked the emergence of an
unknown and fatal virus in
Central America.

With a university the size of ours, I feel a functioning
Student Government Board is a great necessity. Having a

 completed many important projects, and I hope to work just
as effectively as they did with the university officials in get-
 ting the students what they want and need.
' ' As I have stated on the election poster, I plan on making
‘ students’ general concerns my main focus throughout my

' tantly, I am a student. I feel that
being approachable, accessible
and enjoying interaction with

that I possess. With these, along
with experience, I will represent
us, the student body. I believe
that we all face a lot of the same

my years, I have seen both progress and the lack of. I would like
to continue to upgrade campus safety andthe upcoming escort

a lack of effective representation.

As a person that truly cares about this university and
its students, I believe that it is past time for Pitt to fulfill
its potential by permitting student representation to be
STUDENT-based. I have had the displeasure of seeing
different groups and individuals ignored by the adminis-
tration and their “representation.” As your representa-
tive, I do not believe that simply being “here for you” is
enough. Actively seeking student input is what is neces-
sary for effective communication between students and
their representation.

Scott Dolin

The SGB presidency calls
for someone to represent the
entire undergraduate popula-
tion. My background as co-
president of the Campus
Women’s Organization, busi-
ness manager of the SGB
Multicultural Committee, a res-
V ident assistant and intern for

 SGB are my qualiﬁcations.

Many student issues must
be addressed. The student
escort system will increase
safety, but it needs to include
 " ‘ ‘ students walking off—campus.
Meal plans must be developed which don’t rip off the stu-
dents. Recycling on campus has been moving slowly.
Additional student housing has been emphasized in the Master
Space Plan,.but I’d rather see the university support its student
groups. Finding facilities for a Woman’s Center and African
Cultural Center would be a step in fighting student apathy.
Other issues are the ban of campus concerts, possible expan-

sion of our PAT service and extension of the Satisfactory/Not
deadline. *

To keep abreast on student concerns, I’d like more informal
SGB. This would be done by having board members conduct
office hours at tables in the union or Towers one day every

two weeks. .

With changing administration, student concerns can’t be
overlooked. An honest, opinionated, hard-working president is
needed. This is what I’ll be if I’m elected.

 Janera Solomon

Student representatives must be accessible to all students. As
president, I want to hear student concerns and to encourage stu-
dents to be active participants in addressing those concerns. We
have the power to affect change at the University of Pittsburgh.
However, we must all get involved in 'our school with enthusi-
asm and commitment. As SGB president, my focus would be to

increase student participation in the policy making process.’

C We are all students at Pitt and we have the right and power
to affect university policies. Unfortunately, we sometimes are
apathetic, forcing university decision makers and our student
representatives to make decisions with seemingly little student
’ input.

‘ Decisions like raising tuition or making changes in academic

plan, yet increasing the cost; or the new WPU policy that
requires student organizations, hosting events in the union. to pay for three University of
Pittsburgh police officers at $28.65 per hour require student input. To affect these policies.
we must be informed and get involved.

Student leadership involves recognizing the problems. mobilizing others and working

together for change. Being a student leader means facing and overcoming obstacles at Pitt

and encouraging students to take ownership of our university.

Andrew Wuertele

Through my diverse
involvement in Pitt’s commu-
nity including 1994 SGB
». member, president of_the

' Blue and Gold Society and
the Institute of Industrial
_ Engineers, chief justice of the

: IFC and member of numer-
ous administrative commit-
tees, I have acquired a depth
and breadth of leadership
experience and a strong
understanding of the univer-
sity’s shared governance sys-
. ‘W tem.

As your president, I would work to ensure that Student
Government Board is providing efficient and effective ser-
vice to its constituents by redesigning the processes used to
serve students andgroups. Further, _I would demand admin-
istrative participation in evaluating the university’s rela-
tionship with students by taking a bottom-up look at cam-

. pus safety, student health services, alcohol policies, hous-

ing and other areas that affect our everyday undergraduate
experience. Instrumental in realizing these changes is hav-
ing truly representative student interaction throughout the
development and implementation stages.

This university is experiencing tough times and must
confront pressing issues that demand immediate leadership.
Rather than waiting for the arrival of a new chancellor, we
must begin working now to create solutions that meet our
needs. It’s time to elect an SGB president who has the
vision. experience and commitment necessary to create a
more student-oriented University of Pittsburgh.

Cyrus Zolghadri

Through continued relationships with university adminis-
trators and student organizations, I understand the effective-
ness of diplomacy and have the ability to communicate
ideas, contribute energy and achieve success toward a com-
mon goal. My involvement includes: SGB Judicial Board,
New Students Programs Mentor, Inter-Fraternity Council
vice president, Resident Student Association president and
Pitt Varsity Tennis. These activities have strongly developed
my writing, organizational and leadership skills, which I feel
are conducive to membership of the Student Government
Board. .

As a leader on campus at the University of Pittsburgh, I
have gained experience through daily decision making. I
realize the importance of time management and have will-
ingly accepted increased responsibility. I feel that I have the
ability, the direction, and the drive necessary to boost the quality of life on campus for all
students.

One of the greatest things I have learned through campus involvement is the impor-
tance of demonstrating independence and interdependence. Leaders must have the will to
achieve their goals, but most importantly, they must have the ability to listen to the inter-
ests, concerns and expressions of the members they represent. As a member of Student
Government Board, I would work arduously to incorporate the ideas of the student body.

Lisa Caplan

I don’t want to wait to
make a difference, I want to
start now with the Student
Government Board. I enjoy
working with people, espe-
cially on student-related top-
ics. Although I’m only a
freshman, student govern-
ment is nothing new to me.
Throughout my high school
career I was an active "mem-
ber of the student body. I
feel I have the knowledge
necessary to represent the
student body accordingly.
Together we can create a student government that works
for us.

Marc Friedberg '

What is the role of the
student government? Is it to
act as a watchdog over uni-
versity affairs? Is it to act as
a go-between departments
that lack communication? Is
' it to conceive new projects
or ideas or to enhance old
ones? Is it to work for the
betterment of the school or
for the betterment of the
students?

The answer is yes. The
student government takes an
active role in all of these’
and much more. What actually gets done though? Do we
ever see any tangible outcomes to any of these con-
ceived ideas? Over the past several years many impor-
tant issues and ideas have been addressed. and
researched by the student government; unfortunately,
notziuntil this year have we had an SGB that has made
substantial improvements.

I would like to enhance and alleviate problems in

, areas such as food services, public safety, academic

affairs and general communication to the student body.
The students need an SGB that will represent the stu-
dents not only to address their concerns but to take
action. — ‘

It is time for the Student Government Board to realize
what its main goal should be: working first and foremost for
the students. For the past two years I have seen the SGB run
the same way. One president molds the next president with
the same ideas and ideologies they possess. As a result, noth-
ing changes.

I feel the SGB’s first priority should be working with the
administration for improving the undergraduate experience
for Pitt students. A successful board by this definition cannot
be a patsy for policies which are not in the student’s best
interests. As president I would make my primary goal effec-
tive lobbying for the administration by: taking firm stands,
[being persistent in the face of adversity and maintaining tact
and direction at all times.

I also plan to bring the SGB back to the students. If elect-
ed, I will relocate the public meetings from the current small board room to David
Lawrence Hall, where students can feel more comfortable participating in the governing
process. It’s time for a shift in a new direction, one, that is more for the students. I hope
to be the one leading you in that direction.

making sure the university fol-
lows a set of standards which
will assure that the campus
looks like a campus.

The aesthetic review process
comes from Facilities
Planning, which is a sub-divi-
sion of the Facilities
Management Department.

“A significant proportion of
the Oakland campus is in a
historical district, and the city
has to approve any visible

_ changes that are made to the

campus on the historical dis-
trict,” Rouse said.

Rouse said that the process
does more than simply
approve the colors of garbage
cans on campus. “We make
sure the light fixtures, signs
around campus, buildings’
architectural style and all other
things that will make the cam-
pus look more like a campus
are up to standards. “

Rouse pointed out that the
historical district, which
includes a large part of the
university, only came into
existence four years ago.

“This is nothing new.
Campuses have been doing
this for years and years. And-
now we have to become more
aware of the need for it
because of the historical dis-
trict.”

I asked her who allocates the
money for this process. .

“Nobody! It is part of what
we do,” Rouse said.

These are just a few of the problems that face Pitt students every-
day. As an elected representative of the student body, I will approach
these issues in conjunction with providing effective leadership for
our university.

The role that the Student Government
Board plays in the university is to repre-
sent the students and not what is in the
best interest of the person that holds the
position. As an Allocations Committee
member, Ihave seen the needs of many
student organizations. One such need lies
with the method of funding for the club
sports. I plan to start a new funding pro-
gram that will enable club sports to
receive funds that are separate of those
allocated to non-sport organizations
enabling us to meet the needs of all stu-
dent groups. Another concern that I
— would like to address is that of Bigelow
Boulevard. I plan to meet with city and university officials to see
what can be done as far as stop signs, overhead walkways, or even
the closing of the road is concerned, thus giving our university more

Teachers Personal Annuz'ty"J now oﬁers m_ore
ﬂexibility with the new Stock Index Account...
a variable account specifically developed for
the long-term investor who is looking for
more growth opportunities and is willing to
accept more risk.

When you're planning for the future,
every dollar counts. Now you have more
choices to help you make the most of your
'after~tax retirement dollars. With Teachers
Personal Annuity, you can select either our
Fixed Account or our new Stock Index
Account. Or, you may choose to allocate
your money to both accounts. That way you
can take advantage of the highly-competi-
tive effective annual interest rate of the
Fixed Account and the growth potential
offered by the Stock Index Account. With
both accounts, taxes on any earnings will be
deferred until you withdraw them — which
gives you a big edge over taxable accounts.
However, if you withdraw money before age
59%, you may have to pay a federal tax

V penalty in addition to regular income tax.

And remember — as a variable annuity, the
Stock Index Account doesn't guarantee
returns, which will fluctuate over time.

_With a low initial investment, no front-
end sales charges or transfer fees, and no
surrender charge at this time, Teachers

There go the Browns

Help us out here for a minute. How did that old song go? “There
go the Browns. There go the Browns. Onward to Baltimore! the
Cleveland Browns.” Or something like- that, right?

After next week’s game between the Steelers and Browns, all
you loyal Pittsburgh fans may never have to hear that song again.
Of course, neither will all the loyal Cleveland fans who have fol-
lowed their team faithfully for 50 years (not to mention all the peo-
ple Modell is putting out of work by moving his franchise out of
Cleveland). v ’

Why? Well, you probably wouldn’t ask that question, since
almost everyone has heard of Art Modell’s plans to move his team
to Baltimore next. year. Last week Modell made the sudden and
unexpected announcement that he didn’t even care if his team ﬁn-
ished out the season in Cleveland. A good question to ask, then, is
why Modell is making this move? _

The answer boils down to one simple word —— money. In this
case, money actually does walk, straight down the highway to
Baltimore. Modell was given an offer he couldn’t refuse, and he
took it. Over $70 million in moving costs and a new stadium with
70,000-plus seating capacity for 30 years rent-free in exchange for
bringing his team to Baltimore. Who could pass up a deal like
that? ~ .
Modell surely couldn’t — especially since he probably feels
neglected by Cleveland, which has built Jacobs Field. for the

_ — Indians, built Gund Arena for the Cavs and built the Rock and Roll
- Hall of Fame, but which has done nothing for the Browns. Modell

must have forgotten that he owns Municipal Stadium. If he wanted
it remodeled, he could have done it himself.

Modell has been whining for a while now about the ﬁnancial cri-
sis he is trying to deal with. It’s rumored that he had to take out a
loan to pay signing bonuses last year. So what happens to the mil-
lions of dollars every home game brings in to the team, since the

‘stadium is almost always sold out? If the Browns are so broke,

why are they ranked as theninth most valuable  franchise,

- with an estimated worth of around $163 million?

Even though it takes 23 out of 30 votes from NFL owners to

' move the team, this wouldn’t be the first time that vote had been -‘

ignored.’ And even though this move will probably spark enough
litigation to escort in the 21st century, there is very little chance
that it will not take place. .

Modell is setting a dangerous precedent by making this move.
With no clear, logical reasoning behind it, Modell seems to be

p establishing a kind of free-agency for franchises. Even if he is not

trying to, that is exactly what he is accomplishing. This move is
not about anything other than making more money than the
Browns already make (or, more specifically, than Modell already
is making). '

Watch out, because you never know what will happen next. Dan
Rooney may decide to screw all the die-hard Steeler fans by mov-
ing to Dubuque in the next few years. ‘

What is there to celebrate?

his Saturday is a special

I holiday in America
because it represents
everything for which the United
States stands. We celebrate
Americans who have travelled
abroad to shoot foreigners and
lived. (This is an important dis-
tinction, because we have another
holiday in May for Americans

who have travelled abroad to
(shoot foreigners and died_ in the

process.) .

But, you may protest, these
people were defending their
country, so they’re heroes.
Hmmm, defending the country.
Let’s take a look at our handy-
dandy history book and find the
last time a foreign power -attacked
the U.S. mainland. Ah, yes, the
War of 1812. Let’s take a look at
our major skirmishes since that
time.

-Mexican War. America’s first
great land-grab war.

-Civil War. Internal conflict.
Doesn’tcount.

°Spanish-American War. Land
grab 11.

-World War I. We tip the bal-
ance in the last of the European
dynastical wars. The closest the
war comes to America is Western
Belgium.

°World War II. OK, we were
the good guys this time, but we
ﬁrebombed Dresden and nuked
two Japanese cities. We fought
entirely in the Pacific and Europe.
Remember that Hawaii was not a
state until 1959.

Korea and Vietnam. America
is the home of free speech and
free thought, right? Then why did
we spend 80,000 American lives
and many more Asian ones to
ﬁght the spread of a particular
ideology halfway across the
globe?

°Persian Gulf War. We deﬁni-
tively answer the question _of
whether human life or the price of
gasoline is more important to the
average American. (Over 90 per-
cent were pro-this one.)

What I conclude from this is
that we don’t actually have a
national defense — we have a
national offense. But the govem-

Joe
Wright

ment and the mythos of the
United States prevent us from
seeing this.

The whole notion that soldiers
are heroes stems from a notion
that is even more deeply
ingrained — the concept of
America America to most people
is a paragon of what is right and
good, the end result of 2,500
years of civilization. America is
mom, apple pie, baseball and Old
Glory.

America to my mind is com-
posed of four things — a geo-
graphic area, a government, a his-
tory and a national mythology.
The first is merely an artificial,
man—made boundary that has
changed many times. The second
is equally man-made, although as
part of the national mythology we
like to think that our government
was handed down from above.
It’s incredible to me how many
people in this country simultane-
ously hate the federal govemment
and whole-heartedly believe
America has the greatest govem—
ment on Earth. But I digress.

The national history and
mythology are what create our
grandiose notions about patrio-
tism and heroism. By national
mythology, I am referring to the
belief system that is inculcated
into virtually each and every
American from early childhood.
This is done in several ways: '

1. Idol worship. The primary
example is Old Glory, the
American ﬂag. What is one of the
first things you learn in school?
The pledge of allegiance. The
pledge of allegiance?! Think
about those words for a minute.
As a six-year-old, your school
(for most, this means a branch of
the government) makes you stand
up, salute an object and declare
yourself loyal to the ﬂag and the
republic (for which it stands).
Does the word indoctrination
mean anything to you?

2. Nationalism. How many
times have you heard the naked
assertion that America is the
greatest country in the world?

(By naked, I mean with no sup-
porting evidence.) If you ask wh ,
the ﬁrst response will be a funny
look. (You were six once, didn’t
you learn why?) The second
response will be something like,
“Because it is.” Then maybe
you’ll hear something about
America being the freest country
in the world. Have you looked at
virtually all of Western Europe
lately? I could ﬁll the page with
personal freedoms people have
there that you don’t have here.

What does all this have to do
with Veteran’s Day? Well, the
underlying assumption behind the
gloriﬁcation of war in this coun-
try is that America is worth ﬁght-
ing and dying for. I’m not neces-
sarily saying that everyone should
disagree with that idea, but too
often it is an assertion that goes
unchallenged as self-evident.
Looking at some of the facts in a
different light may change your
mind. What I’d argue is, ﬁrst, that
we haven’t fought a war that was
about saving America since the
Battle of New Orleans, and sec-
ond that “America” is an abstrac-
tion rather than anything con-
crete, and I don’t think people
should kill each other over
abstractions.

As you may have guessed by
now, I won’t be participating in
any of the gloriﬁcation of veter-
ans this weekend. At best, these
are guys who made a serious
vocational error and were lucky
to live. Many probably thought
they were doing something noble,
and I say good for them. It’s a lot
easier to go through life if you
believe in what you're doing. At
worst, many of these people are
remorseless killers who think
they did the right thing and are
tenibly wrong.

As for my heroes, I’ll be cele-
brating people like John F.
Kennedy, Jeanette Rankin and
Abbie Hoffman — people who
have tried to keep us out of wars.
I’ll bet those who have died in
wars wish we would have lis-
tened a little more closely.

Before the ITA Rolex Championships,
freshman Erin Shalbrack was confident
that Pitt’s varsity tennis team would do
well. The tournament would “definitely
help us raise our level [of play],”
Shalbrack said. She was partially correct.

Shalbrack and her partner, senior Marla
Zielinksi, beat a doubles team from Drcxel
7-6, 7-4 in the first round of competition.
Pitt’s fall schedule didn’t provide an
opportunity for Pitt to play Drexel, so the
team didn’t know what to expect from
Drexel’s players.

“We were psyched to be at such a presti-
gious toumament,” Shalbrack said. “Marla
and I really communicated during the
match.”

The pair’s ability -to communicate didn’t
carry them through the second round. The
doubles team from Colgate trounced
Shalbrack and Zielinski 6-0, 6-3.

said. “Our play was sluggish.”

The difference between the court sur-
faces in Pitt’s Cost Center and the ITA sur-
face also played a role in the team’s defeat.
The University of Pennsylvania plays their
matches on a hard surface. Pitt’s team
practices for matches on a softer surface
that slows down the players’ volley.

“That’s a problem for us. It’s a different
game,” said Shalbrack. The team tried to
practice at the outside Schenley courts
before the match, but the cold weather

‘ kept practices inside at Cost.

I Toward the end of the ITA match against

‘Colgate, the doubles team had won

three straight matches, but it wasn’t
enough.
“Colgate looked for every opportunity to

kill the ball,” Shalbrack said. “They closed
out the net faster than we could.”

Pitt’s singles entry, sophomore Fran
Davis, played Kristen Fulton, a senior,
from Old Dominion. Fulton beat Davis 6-
2, 6-2.

“I was serving really well, and playing
consistently, but she was a better player,”
Davis said.

Fulton hit hard throughout the game. At

the start“of the match Davis was able to‘.

keep the game even, but Fulton’s aggres-
siveness gave her the edge. Despite the
lopsided score, Davis continued to respond
to the ball, so the final game lasted 20

minutes.

“It went on forever,” Davis said. “I
fought to the end but I couldn’t pull it
out.”

The ITA brings together the top—seeded -

players from the most competitive schools
in the Big East.

“It’s really competitive. Probably the
most competitive [tournament] we do all
year,” Davis said. -

Swimmers set sights on Big East Championship  

By Matt Townsend
Staff Writer

After last year’s 9-3 record
and third-place finish in the
Big East, the -Pitt men’s
swim team is expectingito
regain the Big East title that
it has won the past 11 out of
13 years.

“Third is not very high for
us. It’s the lowest place
we’ve ever had,” said head
coach Chuck Knoles. “We’re
not used to being in third.
It’s a strange thing to say
we’re in third place. It
almost sounds like last to
me.”

Led by Knoles, who is in
his sixth year at Pitt, and
assistant coach Tom Donati,

the Panthers had their fastest ‘

opening meet in a number of
years against Ohio
University.

“That’s a nice omen for us.
We’re typically not fast
starters. As a team we usual-
ly come on at the end of the
season,” Knoles said.

“I think the guys are
focused on trying to regain
the Big East championship.
They are also focused on
trying to reach senior nation-
als, Olympic trials and the
NCAAs._ Goals like that they

have openly expressed to the
coaching staff and written
down on paper. We are going
to be looking for a very
strong season.” _

Key returning swimmers

for the team are: Sam
Vartianen (100- and 200-
meter freestyle), Chris Perry
(100 breaststroke and butter-
fly), Erik Stefanski, Pete
Hezky (top scoring returning
athlete), Steve Lewter
(sprints) and John Salicas
(diving).

This season Knoles is

expecting big things from

freshman Preston Hamontree

. (high school All-American),

Eric Stull (a senior sprinter),
freshman Adam Kotkiewicz,
John Haggerty (transfer from
Ohio University), Chris
Balke (transfer from the
University of Florida) and
Jeremey McClean (senior
diver).

Knoles sees his team’s
depth as its strength. “We

Pitt has had a lot of good
women swimmers over the
years, and this season is no
exception. The women’s

swimming and diving teams

are planning on having
another winning season.

“There are a lot of good
teams in the Big East like
West Virginia, Notre Dame
and Rutgers, but we have a
strong team and should do
extremely well,” said head
coach Marian Cassidy
Keen.

Keen said she has a lot of
talented seniors returning
this year, including Jenny
Doran, Jill Fletcher and
Alicia Tymes.—Doran is tri-
captain and specializes in
the butterfly and freestyle.
Keen said she is counting
on Doran, a three-time Big
East finalist in the 200-
meter butterﬂy, to do well
this season.

Fletcher is also tri-captain
and specializes in breast-
stroke, freestyle and indi-
vidual medley. She has been
working hard, and Keen
said she feels she will be
strong this season.

Chrissy DiLeonardo spe-

cializes in freestyle and
backstroke. DiLeonardo is a
two-time second-team All-
Big East honoree. Keen said
she will replace graduating
senior Vicki Geubtner in
sprint freestyle events.

Alicia Tymes specializes
in freestyle and butterfly
and leads in the top sprint
event at Pitt. She is consid-
ered a team leader as a four-
time second-team All-Big
East honoree.

Keen not only expects her
seniors to do well, but she
expects the same from her
freshmen. “I expect a solid
performance from the new-
comers," she said.

The freshmen are
Samantha Chabotar, Jenny
Banks and Irene Stergios.

Chabotar specializes in
freestyle, breaststroke and
individual medley. Keen is
looking for her to be strong
in distance. Chabotar was in
the 25K Open Water at the

Our weakness is breaststroke
right now. Hopefully we’re
going to be bringing in a
young man in January to
help us out.”

This year the team has
changed its practice schedule
by dividing the team into
training groups of sprint,
middle distance and dis-
tance. Each group practices
at a different times during
the week.

“The training groups
reduces the number of peo-
ple in each group and allows
us [coaches] to focus a little
more on each individual
need, rather than having
everyone practicing at the
same time, and I think that’s
helping us quite a bit,”

In his coaching, Knoles
encourages a great deal of
concentration and responsi-
bility from a very mature
group of college athletes.

“This team is without a
doubt the most mature and
most talented group of swim-
mers I’ve ever coached,”
Knoles said.

Being _together 20 hours a
week, Knoles tries to create
a family atmosphere with the
swimmers.

“The swimmers spend so
much time together that they
are their own best friends,
and me and the women’s
coach end up being the sur-
rogate parents from time to
time. We try to foster a com-

_munity of the feeling of

belonging, community and
pride,” Knoles said. “You
have to be quite a few things
— a father, brother, friend,
disciplinarian, coach, acade-
mic tutor, shoulder to lean on

and someone to encourage.”

According to Knoles, the
key to having a good pro-
gram is getting the swim-
mers to put up their career-
best every time they swim.
In high school they do their
career-high maybe once or
twice, but at this level if they
don’t they will lose. The
coach gets his swimmers to
do their career-best time by
being creative.

“Our court is the most bor-
ing in sports. A swimmer
will see that same black line
300-400 times a practice, so
we as coaches have to make
them think. We get them to
think about times, body parts
and swimming without
breathing. One of my biggest
assets is my assistant coach,
who is the most energetic
coach you will ever meet.
So, we try to keep them
interested and hope they will
respond,” Knoles said.

as strong.
“The girls are going to

have a great season,” head-

diving coach Julian Krug

said, noting that there is a

lot of talent on the team.
“We are going to miss

V Kara Sixbury, but we still

will be strong,” he said.

The two returning seniors
are Amy Spinnenweber and
Sunday Lewandowski.
Spinnenweber is tri-captain
for the second year in a row.
Krug said she is a solid
diver and is looking forward
to her having a great season.

Lewandowski received
All-America honors, honor-
able mention Al1—America
and was named Outstanding
Female Diver at the Big
East Championships. She
won both dives at the com-
petitions and qualified for
Senior Nationals. Krug said
Lewandowski has had an
outstanding three years at
Pitt, and he is looking for
her to have another.

Krug also is planning on
having a great season from
Buffy Smith and Jill Dolbin.
Smith is a sophomore who
Krug said is looking strong
after her leg surgery. Krug
said Smith had a good fresh-
man year. Krug feels she is
a good diver and should do
well this season coming off
a solid freshman year.

Dolbin is a freshman who
Krug feels has a chance of
being a great diver.

With a solid corps of
returning veterans mixed in
with the newcomers, Krug
and Keen are both looking
forward to another success-
ful season. -

The Pitt News, Wednesday, November 8, 1995

Column—
I °From page 7
force the fans to get tanked

before the game at places not
connected with the universi-

ty.

If the Steelers were forced
to undergo these conditions,
they’d be in Tallahassee or
Nashville before the fans
could blink. But the colleges
are stuck.

Not anymore. It’s time to
play hardball. The new foot-
ball facilities are nice, but to
stay competitive with other
top universities, we need to
make some changes.

First, convert existing Pitt

- Stadium into a 68,000-seat

natural grass stadium/con-
vention center/shopping "mall
with a retractable roof for
those cold nights without the
Goodyear blimp. Throw in
10,000 luxury boxes, club
box seats, $10-a-pop park-
ing, beer concessions and’
some hotel rooms in the sec-
ond level (to keep the fans
interested during blowouts),

2 and the club should be able

to recruit anything that
moves. Rename the joint the
Coors/RCA/American
Express/Panther Paul .
Complex (or CRAPP com-
plex, for short), and with
some tricky funding and a
few building demolitions, it
should be up and running by
2012. .

Top talent would flock to
our new sports haven. The
school would have the
money to decrease tuition,
cut bookstore prices and
install locks on all the girls’
showers. Johnny Majors
could do Burger King com-
mercials with Lou Holtz.

I Sportswriters would get rais-

es. It’d be beautiful.

Now, the city won’t be too
happy with these plans.
They’ll probably drag out
those tired arguments about

, how academics are more

important than education, or
the school doesn’t have the
right to boss around
Pittsburgh, or some other
excuse. But we don’t have to
take it. There are plenty of
other cities that are looking
for a Division I sports pro-
gram.
The Baltimore Panthers.

Has a nice ring to it, don’t
you think?
