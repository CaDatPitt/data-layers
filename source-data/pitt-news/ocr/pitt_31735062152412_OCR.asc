‘Charged With Inviting Men
Before Season Opened

 

For_ violation of Interfraternity
Council rushing rules, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon and Sigma Chi social fra-

-ternities yesterday were ﬁned $75

each’ and placed on probation for a
year by action of the Fraternity
Council of the University.

Both fraternities were ' charged
with extending to a ﬁrst semester
freshman invitations to rushing
events in advance of the formal
opening. of the season. The Frater-
mty Committee which passed on the
case declined to reveal the name of
the fraternity bringing the charges
against the two groups.

The ﬁnes which were imposed on
the two houses are to be remitted 00
Interiraternity Council by January
15 anal will be placed in the general
fund of that organization. During
the period of probation which will
extend from January 1, 1931, to
Janiary 1, 1932, an ofﬁcer of each
fraternity must formally report each
month to the dean of men the ac-
tivities of his house. In announc-
ing the penalties late yesterday
afternoon, the Fraternity Committee
stated that their findings should be
ﬁiven publicity through student pub-

cations and that all other members

of Interfraternity Council should be
informed.
- In the charge made against S. A.
13., it was alleged that a pledge to
that fraternity had asked a fresh-
man to a rushing dinner several days
before the opening of the season.
Both the pledge and the rushee ad-
mitted this to a sub-committee
appointed by the Fraternity Com-
mittee to investigate the charges.
The pledge stated that he was un-
familiar with the rushing‘ rules.

A member--of Sigma Chi was-
charged with inviting the same
rushee, also in advance of the sea-
son. He asserted that the change of
date in the opening of rushing
season, occasioned by the Ohio State
football game, had confused him,
and that when he realized his mis-
take, he had attempted to rectify it.

Sigma Chi was represented at the
meetings by Robert George, presi-
dent; George Harrington and John
Bell. Sigma Alpha Epsilon repre-
sentatives at the hearings were:
Daniel Butler, newly elected presi-
dent, and Kenneth Mansﬁeld.

Members of the sub-committee
who conducted the investigation and
reported their ﬁndings to the Fra-
ternity Committee were: Theodore
W. Biddle, assistant to the dean of
men; Robert Ayars, A. H. Arm-
bruster, Ferd C. Arens and Walter
Rome. “ .

 

Reply To Faculty
Club Questionnaires

Some of the questionnaires con-
cerning the future of the Faculty
-Club have been returned and show a
trend toward the acceptance of the
Schenley Hotel proposition, accord-
ing to Dr. Goldberger, president of
Faculty Club.

It has been decided to take a vote
by mail» upon the recommendations
that have been presented by the com-
mittee on thefuture of the club; so
a questionnaire was made up and
sent last Friday to each member
of the club.

The questionnaire contains three
alternatives: ﬁrst, a statement of
whether membership will be contin-
ued if the quarters at the Schenley
Hotel are taken; second, two state-
ments, one asking if the will of the
majority would be all right with that
individual and another asking if the
member desires a general club meet-
ing to discuss the results of this
vote; and third, a statement of any
suggestions for the future of the
club that have not been outlined in
the questionnaire.

It has been requested by Dr.
Goldberger that any member who
has not as yet remitted his reply
should do so as soon as possible, for
a decision of"what is to be done
must be reached shortly. January 14
is the last day the Faculty Club
itvill be able to use its present quar-

ers.

Interfraternity Ball G r o u p
Promises Colorful Event

 

As a ﬁnal touch of what promises
to be the most colorful event of the
social calendar, the Interfraternity
Ball Committee. announced late this
week that negotiations were being
conducted with three well-known
dance orchestras, Will Osborne, Ray
Ingrahm and Paul Specht. The or-
chestra will be deﬁnitely selected
probably late today.

Robert Kleeb, Phi Kappa, chair-
man of the ball committee, expressed
hope of securing Osborne if arrange-
ments can be made with the Na-
tional Broadcasting Company.

Osborne sprang into national
prominence this summer as a mas-
ter of ceremonies, night club enter-
tainer, and “crooner” of popular
songs, when he contested the latter
distinction with his recognized rival,
Rudy Vallee. Both of these favor-
ites laid claim to the mythical title

most Crooner.” Newspapers all over
the country featured the rivalry be-
tween the two popular stars, and
there was even talk of a proposed
ﬁstic battle to settle the dispute. The
disagreement, however, was smoth-
ered by the popularity of each of
the prominent band leaders.

Tickets Out January 5

Tickets go on sale Monday, Janu-
ary 5, and may be purchased at the
office of the Dean of Men, from Wil-

members of the ball committee:
Clarence Rogers, Delta Sigma Phi;

Arthur George, Omega Delta; Rob-
ert Beck, Phi Gamma Delta; Mor-
ris Naumoﬁ’, Sigma Alpha Mu, and
David Coffey, Delta Tau Delta. The
assessment for the dance has been
placed at $5.50 per couple.

Althou h it is being sponsored
by Interfraternity Council, the In-
terfraternity Ball is open to any
student on the campus, regardless
of whether or not the individual is
a fraternity member.

Children Get Gifts
After Arcus Party

The Arcus Club will hold its an-
nual Christmas party honoring the
alumnae on December 26 at the
Heinz House.

Instead of exchanging gifts among
the members of the club as has been
the custom in past years, each mem-
ber will bring a gift suitable fora
child. After the party these gifts
will be taken to the Soho Community
house when they will be distributed
among the poor children of the dis-
trict.

Annual Dinner

u——_——o

Dr. John G. Bowman announced
$75,000 collected’ and banked for the
ngtionality rooms on the Commons
Room floor of the Cathedral of

Learning, and many more thousands
were pledged, last Friday evening
when Dr. Bowman entertained the
members of the ﬁfteen nationality
groups in the Breakfast Room of
the University Club. ‘

Peter Fischer, treasurer of the

German group, presented Dr. Bow-
man with a check for $5.000 in be-
half of the Germans. John Tsui,
chairman of the Chinese room com-
mittee, announced a $10,000 dona-
tion by the Chinese government to-
ward the furnishing of the Chinese
room.
Dr. Bowman spoke. briefly on the
progress of the Cathedral, and the
evelopment of the plans as ad-
vanced by the various nationality
groups during the year. He also
paid a tribute to Mrs. Ruth C.
Mitchell, interior decorator of the
Cathedral, and to Dr. Francis Ty-
son, adviser of the nationality
groups, for their work in aiding the
progress of the Cathedral. He also
stated that he hoped to perpetuate
the organization of the nationality
groups, and added that he wanted
all representatives of the national-
ity groups to meet at least once
every year.

Plan Scholarships

All the delegates were in favor of
Dr. Bowman's plan to perpetuate
the organization of the nationality
groups after the rooms were com-
pleted. Kosto Unkovich of the

ugoslav committee suggested that
all the committees meet once a year
as a group and decide upon one
needy boy and girl, without regard
to nationality, whose career they
could at the University ﬁnance.
This was immediately approved by
the other guests.

e representative from each
group submitted a report. of the se-
- ivities and plans of his committee.

drrey‘Li‘ii,'  of'='the“Chliiesei
committee. spoke of the difliculty of
adopting the Chinese arch to the
American building. A member of
the Hungarian committee announced
that they were employing Mr.
Jurkes, one of the most noted archi-
tects in Hungary, to harmonize the
Hungarian room with the Commons
room. Maurice Eriksson-of Scan-
dinavia in concluding his talk, said
that the purpose of the nationality
rooms was, from his standpoint, to
pay a debt to our forefathers and
to raise a monument to our chil-
dren.

The representatives of the na-
tionality groups included: Frederick
Sheafer and Maurice Eriksson,
Scandinavia; Rineheart Eulricli,
Peter Fischer and Henry Meuschke,
Germany; William P. Ortale and
Mrs. Heinze Langer, Italian; Loren-
zo Pomer and Rev. S. Labujewski,

Sidney Lui, China; Miachel Schram,
Czechoslovakia; George Zimmerman
and Rev. Sebastyan, Hungary, and
Margaret Gwyer and Elvyra Blcad-
ingser, Welsh. .

llpon Frosh,

“The success of the 1931 foot.
ball team rests with the present
freshman squad,” stated Eddie
Hirshberg, newly-appointed pilot
who succeeds Eddie Baker as
captain of Dr. Sutherland’s
Golden Panthers, in an interview
with a member of the Weekly
staff.

“Although we have plenty of
material remaining in the present
varsity,” continued Hirshberg,
“our unusually hard schedule will
force us to rely largely upon.the
second year men. As previous
“odd years” have shown, I have
every reason to believe that we
will come through with a win-
ning team. Spring practice and
the fall training camp should
give early indications of the
squad’s full strength.”

Hirshberg remarked that there
is always a tendency to over-rate
a team's possibilities, and hopes
that this will not be true of the
Panthers. Like Dr. Sutherland,
Hirshberg hopes to “take things
as they come,” make no predic-
tions, and devote his eﬁorts to
the squad.

The plot comes in the form of
some young men of Oxford, on the
loose. They don't seem to have any
reason for being there except to be
a plot, but then that is more rea-
son than most of the guests would
have given. The Oxford boys (not
from Oxford, Ohio) stage a battle
with each other until they all hit

quently demolished by St. George,
who arrives at the crucial moment.

Well, now that is over, and we
were all gently ushered into the
outside of the ballroom, to wait for

laughter, all for the asking, that is
almost, and you couldn't be mer-

the crowd over and wonder why so-

such, and why some one else wasn't
here at all. Boy it's nice to rate

cause there will never be another

Leaders Will
Go To Confab

7 Pitt Delegates To Attend
Prof-Student Meet

 

 

'1'-hree student leaders and four
representative faculty and admin“-
trative delegates will ‘leave shortly
after Christmas for the first annual
National Student Faculty Confer-
ence in Detroit,‘ Dec. 27-31. Mar-

ton ‘Newman, ’31, respective
Presidents of the Y. W. and Y. M.
A.,_ represent these two student
organizations, _and Robert Maches-
ney, Col. ’32, Pitt Weekly editor, has
been named from the student body.

the dean of women; Dr. S. B. Lin-
hart, J. G. Quick, Dean Clothier and
Y. W. Mendenhall. Y. M. C. A. see-
retary, complete‘ the delegation as
administrative representatives.

N ation-Wide Project

The student faculty conference
m_ark~s a signiﬁcant project, nation
wide, for the first time, in creatin
co-operation between student and
collegiate administrators and in
working out.plausible relations of
religious activities on the general
campus.

‘For the past four or ﬁve months,
Dean Amos and Secretary Menden-
hall have been active on two of the
seven big commissions, formed of
leading college heads that have
formulated the outstan 'ng features
of the conference:
policy, educational systems, social
and organized life ‘on the campus,
the project on which Miss Amos
acted as co-chairman, morals in a
day of relativity, social attitudes
and responsibilities, student coun-
seling andthe place of religionin
higher education.

Campus Group Large

The group of men and women go-
ing from this campus will comprise
one of the largest representations
at Detroit during the conference,
for although every university and
college in United States, having an
accredited colle iate rank, is en-
titled to two de egates, one faculty
and one student, those having varied
development and experience in gen-
eral campus and organized reli 'ous
activity have been permitte to
send a group over the regular
quota.

In addition to the official repre-
sentatives, Rev. T. E. ' r, as-
sistant pastor at First Baptist
Church, student religious adviser,
and Rev. Kinley McMillan, Presby-
terian student pastor, will join the
Pittsburgh group.

Players Will Stage
‘Captain Apple Jack’

Pitt Players have announced that
their next production, “Captain Ap-
plejack,” will be produced on Feb-
ruary 19, at the Y. M. H. A. audi-
torium. Walter Hackett, the play-
wright, has given it the sub-title,
“An Arabian Night’s Adventure in
Three Acts.” Tryouts were held on
Wednesday.

“Captain Applejack” tells the
story of a quiet, unassuming coun-
try gentleman who gets tired of liv-
ing monotonously. He decides to
sell his estate and get away from
the deadening atmosphere of the
country. To get people interested
in his farm, his real estate agent

More Solids Fall

In 1923-24, a second survey was
made by Mellon Institute to deter-
mine what results had been accom-
plished during ten years of regula-
tion. It was found that the ense
smoke prohibited by law had been
decreased about 70. per cent; at the
same time, the total solids precipi-
tated had been increased nearly 40
per cent.

Since that time, the effort has
been to reduce the volume of cinder
and ash emitted, although the ordi-
nance under which the Bureau of
Smoke Regulation operates does not
cover anythin except dense smoke.

Mellon Insti ute is now engaged
upon a third survey, which is much
more comprehensive than either of
the others, in that a study is be-
ing made not only of solids precipi-
tated from the atmosphere, but of
air-borne dust and gases and their
e ects. In most of the apparatus,
use is made of the photo-electric
cell-the Magic Eye of Science—-
and particular attention is being
paid tothe measurement of solar
radiation, particularly naturavl ultra-
violet. I

Meller Heads Survey

Mr. H. B. Meller, senior Indus-
trial Fellow, formerly dean of the
school of mines, heads this non-
commercial research, and is aided by
four assistants. Plans in regard to
the scope of the investigation will
necessitate a larger personnel. Ex-
perimental work includes the deter-
mination of amounts and composi-
tions of solid matter and gases at
the sources; study of the distribu-
tion and behavior of these solids and
gases in the atmosphere; their ef-
fects, particularly in screening out
sunshine; and the possibility of de-
veloping methods to prevent them

from getting into the atmosphere.

Deposited solids are collected ‘in
containers placed at nineteen differ-

ent stations in the city of Pitts-I
burgh. The daily samples exhibit

19136 effect of varying weather condi-
tions and are examined and tabu-
lated every day; monthly samples,
g_iv,l.n an adeguate amount of mate-
rial or chemical analysis are ob-
tained ' from another container
placed in close proximity to the con-
trol one.

To test the screening effects of
smoke on the rays of the sun, the
photoelectric cel is used, and the
institute investigation is working on
another device, called the capnome-
ter, which uses the photo-electric cell
in combination with a modulated
light beam, a tuned ampliﬁer and an
indicator and which will enable sci-
entists to measure the extent of air
pollution. ‘

Room Drawings Soon

 

Mr. Tong Kerei, a student at Har-
vard who is drawing the plans for
the Chinese room on the Commons
Room_ ﬁoor of the Cathedral of
Learning,— intends to finish them
during the Christmas vacation.

He will be assisted by Henry K.
Mui-phy,. well-known New York
architect, who has done much to re-
build modern China without doing
away with the old Chinese designs.
Mr. Murphy stopped in Pittsburgh
last week to see the Cathedral and
to discuss plans for the Chinese
room with Mrs. Ruth C. Mitchell, in-
terior decorator.

Mr. Murphy has designed the Uni-
versity o Yenching in Peping,
China, and Gingling College in

this work has been made adviser of

the building of the government
buildings in China.

Business Men Asked
To Employ Students

 

 

Di'._ S. B. Linhart, secretary of the
University, is chairman, is at pres-
ent seeking to interest business
ﬁrms and manufacturing corpora-
tions in the employment of students
who must secure either full or part
time employment in order to main-
tain themselves during their Uni-
versity course.

The committee of Education is one
of the most important committees
of the Chamber of Commerce, and
while it may seem stran e that a
business organization shou d have a
committee of this kind, it is never-
theless appropriate because it is a
recognition by industry and com-
merce of the importance of educa-
tion and its value in the training of
young men and women for positions
in these ﬁelds.

The Indiana Santa Claus gets let-

ters from nearly *everywhere:I Aus-

lieving scoffers -such as we Pittites.
And don't forget one of the requi-
sites is to tell Santa Claus what a
good child you've been all year and
how you've done your lessons every
night. I

You still don't believe a word of

Games will be played.

Of course no Christmas is Christ-

Yuletide Spirit Reflected By
Christmas Number

From its dazzling colored cover
which illustrates the first Santa
Claus mistake ever to be illus-
trated, back to the Hazard Page,
the Christmas issue of the Pitt Pan-
ther, which made its appearance on
the campus" last Tuesday, has caught
the elusive spirit of sophisticated
holiday spirit.
Foremost among the contributors
to the issue is Florence Fisher
Perry, of the Pittsburgh Press. The
noted “I Dare Say” columnist writes
on the subject, -“Go Home for Christ-
mas,” a subject that should be near
to the heart of every University
student. I

As a special help for Christmas
shoppers, the Panther has a double

. page “conﬁdential buyer’s guide, for

handy reference and an u set
stomach.” The feature is il us-.
trated, which should be a great help
in confusing those already confused
by the text.

Marvin T. Herrick continues his
“Theatre” page with an intellec-
tual and serious dissertation on the
“great American laugh,” while on
the opposite page in “Analysis,”
Morris Cohen ﬁnds that two of the
three factors which played thd
greatest part in the rise of Pitt's
basketball reputation are but mem-
ories. I

Another murder case, “The
Christmas Murder Case,” follows
the foot rints of its successful Sher-
lock Ho mes thriller of the .Novem-
ber issue. This time it concerns
Philo Vance, sensational detective,

murderer.
“Things About Town” tells where
“to show off,” where “to shake a

chellia; and “Fair Comment and
Criticism” again informs the man
what to wear and when.

Education To Get
Money False, Browne-

“An education only for the sake
of learning how to make a proﬁt-
able living is learning under false
auspices. Learning for the love of
knowledge, when it is a training for
the intellect, is the real value in
education.

“College years are years of lei-
sure for reading outside of formal
education. ,

“Browsing around a library, look-
ing into books, learningllittle hits
at a time; knowledge acquired in
this way is the kind best remem-
bered.

“We need to become conscious of
the world about us. Specialization
will make us narrow.”

These are some of the statements
Dr. Lewis Browne, author, lecturer,
and authority on comparative reli-
gion, made to a student group at the
Y. M. & W. H. A. Tuesday after-
noon, December 16, before his eve-
ning's lecture.

Carols, Piano Solos
Feature Noel Party

The French Club held its Christ-
mas Cabaret party, Friday, Decem-
b-er 12, at Heinz House. Madame
Baudry gave a short talk on the
holiday customs of France.

Several piano solos, dancing on
the part of a few of the coeds, and
Christmas carols completed the pro-
gram. Refreshments were served.
The “Soiree” was attended by about
ﬁfty members, who enjoyed them-
selves thoroughly.

The next meeting of the club will
be held the second Friday in Janu-
ary. Plans are now being made to
l...ve another outside speaker.

If you should suddenly happen to

Just what we poor humans look like
to a gold fish in a bowl just drop
around sometime and ask Jack Sny-
der, Bus. Ad. ’32, who puts on a
free show for the villagers in a
downtown drug store window eve_rY
day. From his white enameled, min-
iature bathroom in the window Jack
views us common mortals in our
petty wanderings in the triangle
area.

Not. wishing to start another stu-
dent riot or anytlung. but What WP
want to report IS. that Jack wont
have to shave until Saturday morn-
ing, January 17, 1933. You see,
Jack is advertising a face cream, or
rather a shaving cream, for a com-

y and the company sees that
Ken}: -gets tuition money. - _

At approximately two-thirty ev-
ery day Jack leaves our beloved
Alma Mater and trips to his window
and his razors and shaving creams.

THESEEETHOSE

From that time until he's through.
Jack goes through the various
movements of an honest-to-goodness
shave. And it is said he shaves
himself thirty.-ﬁve times a day, or
thereabouts.

Now at that rate, it would make
one thousand ﬁfty shaves a month
and since he's been going for about
that lon already, nineteen thirty-
three is s shaving appointment.

Since he has been in the window,
Jack has become as much of a down-
town ﬁxture as the Grant building
or the clock there at Fifth and
Smithﬁeld. If, on our way home in
the evening, we should miss one of
Jack's demonstrations, our whole
day would be ruined.

We could report on thousands of
other ways to make tuition, work-
ing in a drug store for intance, but
they are too commonplace. At any
rate, Jack goes on shaving, and we
go aoln watching, and thereby hangs
a t e. I

The dear old Dirt Dispensary is
fermenting again and all about a
new idea. Be a Hero. Next week is

_ going to be Be a. Hero Week and you

gotta do something big. If you can
keep someone from taking a lolly-
pop from a baby or if you can make
a schizoid (explanation from The
Human Mind) happy you are eligi-
ble to be a Hero. "No prizes, no
credit, except what you give ‘your-
self. First we will tell you about
one real hero, George Patton. A few
days ago when George was calling
upon a young lady by the name of
Corinne Franz, they two together
heard a loud explosion. George, like
the brave Kappa Sig that he is, ran
out of the house and down the street
to the scene of the big noise. There
were people to be saved so George
saved them. Now that’ what we
want you to do. Have a big ex-
plosion and save people. But all
kidding out, we feel rather proud
that out of all the crowd that gath-
ered around the exploded house,
George and another anonymous man
were the only ones with enough
nerve to do anything about it . . .

Have to give our profs a break.
We always ﬁnd out that they
amount to what we want to amount
to. And this time We Francis Stone
and Miss Wilkinson, of the English

ous mags. Jealous-—we-eell? . . .
Room 107 has a horseshoe hung
right over the entrance of the door.
When you're feeling down in the
mouth one day, stand under it and

ing such a superstitious fool that
you'll forget to be down in the
mouth. . .

Now to get into the dirt. Politics
on the menu, a la carte, or as you
like it. Did you know that Doug-
las Mansﬁeldfs father, D. -W., is the
Mansﬁeld who is candidate for the

resident Pro Tem of the Senate?

oug"s father also owns the Mc-
Keesport Daily News for which
Eddie, that is, Mr. Captain Eddie
Hirshberg, used to drag in the news,
when there was any. . .We hate
to tell you, “We to <1 you so,” but
we must have the thunder. The Y
hut yodelers, that inimitable trio,
composed of Ed Buente, Tom Sav-
age and George Hatcher, with My-
ron Schuller as pianist, went over
with a hang at the Senior Women's
luncheon last week. And to boot,
they have in their pockets four con-
tracts to sing on future occasions.

And then all I do besides gather

thoughts . . . what in the world ever
happened to Henry Pelrson and Paul
Pippart or did they graduate‘! Every
day that passes ﬁnds one or more
of the good old familiar faces gone.
Remember when college was college
or am I getting old and bitter and
cynical . . . Remember when you
couldn't find George Boggs without
ﬁghting your way through a crowd
of adoring piphis; when Betty
Knapp and Mary Lou German were
pals; when Tom McMurray and
Smitty Morton waited under the
clock for Muriel Condrad and Mar-
ion Bodkin respectively; when all
the freshman girls made eyes at that
old smoothie Tomorrow McLenahan
but he hadn't eyes for anybody but
a certain Marjorie; when Viers
Adams was a good inﬂuence around
Alumni Hall and Charlie (Spanish)
Monticone had classes ﬁlled with
soft eyed females; when Eddie’
Baker was not being accosted_lly
people who had never been in -
duced to him and he wasn't captain
of the football team . . . gee, is this
fun! I could go on forever and a
day just saying remember but every-
body thinks this isn't such a bad
year . . . I'm getting old.

George Hatcher does make‘_an

he have fun . . . Christine Ruoif

To the Anonymous who pasted
the note for These and Those on the
Bulletin Board in the Weekly Oﬂice:
Once I wrote an anonymous letter
and it was pretty derned good too
Iotrhoiiitght but I got my face smacked I
speaking. that is. However I turned
out to be a columnist which just
goes to show if you can't make dirty
digs in unsigned letters it gotta
come out some way. The latest and
newest definition for columnists like
us is Schizoid and you gotta read:
a high class book to find out what
it means. I blush to tell it.

I feel sorta lost every now and
then when it comes to the Honor
Spot because nobody is doing any-
thing really noble unless all the
noble things are hidden from my
eyes. But I guess I’ll just take a
chance on giving it to somebody who
I think would do noble things . . .
and that person is Robert Remale
(Robert is attached already, I’l
have you understand and I mean
nothing peisonal by it, see!) Any-
way Robert (Bob) is the kind of a
guy whom babies and dogs and pro-
fessors like, not to mention girls and
girls’ mothers . . . and he is the kind
of a guy that a soft hearted silly
like me would call gallant . . . so I
want Bob to stand up and I'll pin the
Honor Spot on his vest along with
the rest of the jewelry and that’s
just about all for today.

95% Dent Seniors
°Purcha_se 1931 Owls

While the’Owl sorority contest is

‘ _ progressing at full speed, prelim-

inary reports reveal that the seniors
of the dental school have come
through with a record of ninety-
nine per cent perfection in the pur-
chase of 1931 Owls. Out of an en-
rollment of 120 dental students, 114
have made their down payments
toward the purchase of copies of the
coming University yearbook.

According to reports -made by the
various sorority solicitors Monday,
Theta Phi Alpha sorority has an
edge on its competitors ,for the
handsome silver tea set that IS
waiting to be presented to the so-
rority that sells the greatest num-
ber of copies of the 1931 Owl. The

leading sorority are Doro y Slat-
tery, Grace Doyle and Mattie Wood-

The contest will close at 3 o'clock
this afternoon, at which time the

Heinz House Has Mistletoe
But, Alas! Fellas, Coeds
Can’t Stand Under It

The Yule season is here! Even
if you had done the Rip Van Winkle
act and didn’t know the date, the
atmosphere of Heinz House would
tell you so. Mistletoe hangs in
festoons about the room. Collegians
please note: to be speciﬁc mistletoe
hangs on the walls and from per-
sonal experimentation we have dis-

covered that it is impossible to stand
beneath it. _ Evei-greens are ar-
ranged at intervals around the
room; the air is permeated with the
spicy smell of the pine woods, and
to make it more realistic occasion-
ally one ﬁnds a pine needle in one’s
chair——:xfter having sat on it.

The ap roach of the season has
brought orth the usual quota of
parties. There are the usual con-
ventional teas and all sorts holiday
meetings. The German Club is hav-
ing a children's party—-no insinua.
tions. The foreign students are
having a novel aﬁair during the va-
cation. and the Women's Associa-
tion, composed of the wives of. fac-
ty members and of women faculty

plete record of the famous explorer’s'

polar ﬂight, compiled under direction
of the Swedish Qiciety of Anthro-
pology and Geography, and edited by
a friend of Andree’s, is on sale at
the College Music Shop, 105 Atwood
street. And here’s another -thing-
it’s the only place in Pittsburghtliat
it is sold. * .

ANOTHER BELIEVE it or not
(again with apologies to Mr. Ripley)
—-but you students who usually eat
at restaurants are rather hard to
convince —- the University Store.
Forbes and Boquet, make their own

their own pics and cakes. So-ifyou
men, and girls, too, who live away
from home, get hungry for the kind
of things that mother used to make,
Just drop in at the University Store.

NOTHING COULD be more en-
trancing to that little coed, or even
the outside girl who likes the Uni-'
versit just because her boy-friend
goes here, than an article of jew-
elry, or one of the clever leather

urses I saw at Stauft’s, with the

niversity seal _on it. They have
enameled compacts in almost any
color scheme a girl's heart could de-
sire, besides rings, cigarette light-
ers and belts for the men.

WHEN YOUR maiden aunt, whom
you haven't seen for umpty-eleven.
years, gives you a ten-dollar gold:
piece for Christmas, and then maybe
dad loosens_up and increases your
allowance, why not do the sensible;
thing with your -money? Start an
account in the Forbes National
Bank, keep adding to it every time
you feel in funds, and see what a
relief it is next year when the
fraternity dues roll around-—as they
due, inevitably. Pin sorry!

A CHARMING gift for the girl
who likes unusual things are the new
mesh chokers that I saw today at the
Archery Gift Shop, 3603 Forbes
street. One was in gold and green
with the unusual gold and green
enameled clasp, another on the pop-
ular black and white-—‘in fact there
are necklaces for every taste-—-and
the price is amazingly low. And
for your room or fraternity house
ask to see the little black and white’
dogs that will walk “all by them-
selves.” Honestl ‘I '

IF YOU are dreading a ‘lonely
Christmas dinner, forget it, and o
to the Betsy Ross, Forbes and 0a -
land avenues, for a real, old-fash-
ioned turkey dinner with all the
ﬁxins’. You’re sure to meet some of
your friends there-——for the Betsy
Ross seems to be a regular “hang-
out” for colle e students. And don't
forget New ear’s Eve—-they give
away souvenirs ‘Ii’ everything. It’s

, a real p-arty.

To the Editor of the Pitt Weekly:

Colonel Cullen. in the interview
which appeared in the Pitt Weekly
of December 12th, challenges -every
thinking student of American life
interested in the peace of America
and of the world to give a moment's
thought to a unit of contemporary
American civilization, the R. O. T. C,

In American colleges there are
186,000 boys between the ages of 17
and 23 actively engaged in the stu-
élgﬁz of the proper methods of war-

The units of the R. O. T. C. are
under the direct control of the War
Department of the United States Gov-
ernment. The college administration
has absolutely no voice in the select-
tlon of the personnel of the R. 0. T.
C. teaching staff. The War Depart-
ment appoints the instructors and
as under its controj all matters_

. T. C. is cloth d b ‘th

T. C. get a distorted idea of war as
a thing of beauty—ot marches and
military proms—-of medals and drink-
ing bouts, Thus attitudes that make
War possible are formed.

Colonel Cullen blames war on the
politicigns. Al Capone has Ithe same
complaint to make of gang warfare.
Accepting‘ Al Capone's and the Pro-
fessor's statement, are we to lend
our moral approval to their actions?
Unless we were drunkv with the
rig,hteousne_ss_ of our cause, I'd say
no.

.A great deal of the dirt from the
excavation for the new Mellon Insti-
tute and from the excavation for the
Presb erian Hospital is being used
torﬁl in the low places in Frick
Acres; When this grading work is
finished, and the ground has settled
somewhat, shijubbery will be planted
and the landscaping of the ground
around the Cathedral begun. In
grading the grounds, the fact that
other buildings beside" the Cathedral
will be built on Frick Acres is being
kept in mind and allowances are be-
ing made. The assurance of a proper
locale for the high building depends
on the early planting of flora and
fauna round about it, for it usually
takes green thing-:. a while to grow,
as you probably know if you have
ever raised geraniums and petunias
like we have tried to -do.

Panther sales (the Pitt Panther is
the official humorous magazine of
the University) this week were
encouraged by putting one of the
salesman in the Panther hide. For
your information, the present Pan-
ther hide is really a camel's hair
hide, manufactured into the general
form of a panther by A. J. Masters,
taxidermist in Pittsburgh.

Most of the Yuletide spirit at pres-
ent noticeable on the campus is due
to the sale ‘of the Christmas Number
of the Panther. Remember how in
high, school someone always used
to write “Merry Christmas” on the
black ‘board with red and green
chalk, and almost every one had, a
few Christmas cards to shyly hand

Pitt’s wandering basketeers come

from Dartmouth at the stadium on
Tuesday. It’s just one tough. one

‘ after another for Doc Carlson's

crew, but the boys are taking them
as they come and aren't concerned
about distant games and high
sounding reputations. i

 

s far as reputations are con-

cerned, the Panthers are held rather
highly themselves. During the past

few years, Pitt has been amony the
best inthe countr “and so it a up
to the present _e man of Carlson-
men.to keep up ‘the good work and
tread the same winning

their predecessors. At lumbus

last. week the Panthers were far
from good, but the Buckeyes were
several notches worse and missed
enough shots to win two ordinary
games; and as a result, Willie Ar-
«ture and his mateschalked up their

ﬁrst win of the. season.

Thus far, Don Smith and Willie
Kowallis have come through in
great style and have borne the
greater port of a not so powerful
attack. Pitt has been fortunate this
year in being able to uncover sow-

more stars. In football, Heller,

der and Dailey were good enough to
win starting berths, and now Smith

.Tech After Holidays

 

_ The R. O. T. C. has ﬁnally been
Instrumental in securing its own
rifle range, after having attempted
to obtain one for the past ﬁve years.
The range under construction, is
situated in the stadium building op-
posite the basketball pavilion. It Will
probably be ready for use the week
of Janus, 5.

The University is standing behind
the project, although the varsity
riﬂe team will be classed as a. minor,
sport. Last year the rifle team
used the 176th Field Artilelry arm-
but this year, unable to secure its
use, the team was deprived of a
range until now. . .

There will be a varsity and an
R. O. T. C. team this year, and pos-
sibly a freshman and a girls’ team.
The latter two teams are prob-
lematical. The varsity team will be
subject to‘ University athletic eligi-
bility rules.

The team’s ﬁrst two matches of
the season will be with New York

Technology on the week of Janu-
ary 5. Pitt has joined the National

ther, assistant coach.

The R. O. T. C. team, on the
other hand, will be made up only of
R. O. T. C. members and will have
a squad of twenty-ﬁve. S. B. Weur-'
tenberger, manager of the team,
has arranged for it to participate in
the Third Corps .Area Intercollegiate
Match which runs from January 1
to March 10. and in the William

With the completion of the sur-
vey of the records of the class of
1928 by the Department of Research
in Higher Education, it was found

that the psychological tests taken
by these students in their freshman
year bear a very deﬁnite relation to
the scholastic record of the student
during his four years on campus.
Thus, the students coming through
with good grades in the freshman
tests held a consistently good rec-
ord throughout. A similar survey
is being conducted for the class of
1932.

Among the other problems that
the department is working upon are
studies of foreign and second-gener-
ation students; unit cost studies;
university publicity; conduct of
remedial reading classes for slow
readers, studies of scholarship of

athletes versus non-athletes, and the
study of relations between second-
ary and higher education.

This department was organized in
1926 when it was discovered that an
organization was needed to find and
help solve the problems arising at
the University. At the present time

the department’s function is to pro-

vide a means for the study of prob-
lems -which bear on the efficiency of
the organization and happiness of
the personnel: provide student per-
sonnel service of fact-ﬁnding na-
ture; encourage good teaching and
provide means of experimentation in
this ﬁeld; to establish a center in
which information about this insti-
tution and others may be collected
and available to all; and to encour-
age both private and committee

research in problems of higher edu- _

cation.

Heinz House Counterpart Of
Blaring Activities Hut?
You Wouldn’ t Think So! .

The only similarity between
Heinz House and Activities Hut
is that they’re both made of
wood. If it weren’t that the
piano at Heinz House is used
by the Glee Club once a week
it would be covered with ex-
actly three and one-half inches
of dust (computing from the
time it was installed) if it
weren't for the fact that it E
dusted every day (7); while ev-
every budding genius in Activi-
ties ‘Hut manages to practice
his scales when the oﬁices are
busiest.

At Heinz .Hou.se girls lit in
comfortable rockers and study.
The room is quiet and orderly.
A girl once dropped a paper and
from pure loneliness t hopped
along the door and jumped into
the waste basket. The chintz
drapes hang just right and add
a cozy touch to the room. One
would no more think of talking
in a loud tone than she would
of smashing an antique vase.

At Activities Hut the boys sit,
lounge or skip around the
building with a beautiful dis-
regard for peace and quiet.
Some play chess, some checkers
and sometimes tummy or black-
jack. Some philanthropist ren-
ders selections from the latest
song hits as he lies comforta-
bly-scattered over a sofa. Two
boys argue outside the Weekly
office ‘as to the probable chances
..of a third falling off his chair.‘

pices of the Cornell Club of West-
ern Pennsylvania. ‘

bers .of the Glee, Banjo and Man-
dolin clubs, will present a program

mer glee club manager, is expected

aged by James E. Neary, Jr., Brook-
lyn, president; Eugene M. Hanson,
Haiison’s post is elective
and he is responsible for the trip

nity house in the university-truck,
for their annual Christmas party
given by the social service commit-

Ed. ’32, chairman.

Editorial Comment F a v o r a
Two Current Articles

 

The articles of George Ketchum
and Dr. W. T. Root in the Decem-
her issue of the Pittsburgh Record
have_ aroused considerable comment
in Pittsburglnas is reﬂected on the
editorial pages of the Pittsburgh
Press and the Post-Gazette.

It will be remembered that R. L.
Duffus in Harper's Magazine in-
dicted Pittsburgh as being uncivil-
ized and lacking in the humane vir-
tues. Mr. Ketchum’s answer in his
article, “The Wages of Modesty,” Is
thoroughly endorsed in an editorial
in the Press. “There is much to
what Mr. Ketchum says,” states the
editorial. “Thisycharacteristic mod-
esty-—in itself a fine attitude-——is in
Pittsburgh often carried to an ex-
treme where it becomes almost a
vice. . .” ‘

An editorial , in the Post agrees
with Dr. W. T. Root, head of the
department of psychology at the
University and ‘a trustee of the
Western Penitentiary, in his opin-
ion that legal offenses by public oili-
cials, involving public dishonesty,
should be looked upon as treason
and punished with the severest
penalty. The editorial goes further
in stating that Mr. Root’s descrip-
tion of public dishonesty is very
tem erate.

-“ ii most instances,” it says. “the
offending officials "do not merely
look with lenience upon infractions
by their friends and supporters: Out
and out grafters. they virtually sell
the privilege of law violation to any
who have the price _to Day,” The
editorial recalls the widely discussed
suggestion of a few years 880 that
a public oﬂicial caught plundering
his government or using his pﬁice
for rivate gain, should; receive a
doub e penalty, the additional one
being for the betrayal of public
trusts.” _

The Pittsburgh Record is edited
by C. V. Starrett; Col. ’24.

Invade Campus Activities

The enchanted pipes of the goat-
god Pan seem to have lured a large
number of Freshman girls to enter
Glee Club. A canvass of school or-
ganizations shows that the Satyr has
claimed a greater numb: of de-
votees than any other campus group.
Fifty-seven prospective Marion Tal-
leys appeared at tryouts, and only
three were barred from entrance. Of

the group admitted, Mrs. Ayres says,-

“Five or six have possibilities as
soloists, and the rest have good
choral voices." '

loud opinions otherwise.

vinces one that the Muse of Liter-
