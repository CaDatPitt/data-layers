Dinner
honors
student
leaders

By Jenifer Crook
Staff Writer

Pitt's student leaders were hon-
ored last night at a recognition

9 banquet sponsored by the Stu-

dent Government Board.

”You are the students who
have done something other than
going to classes. I thank you, and
the university thanks you. This
place wouldn't be the same
without the things you've done
for it,” said Pitt's director of stu-
dent activities, Joseph Cavalla,
who was the guest speaker for the
banquet

‘ Cavalla added that employers
often Contact him to get the
names of campus leaders.

”Employers look for active stu-
dents,” he said. ”They usually are
hard, dedicated workers.”

Elissa Klein, an SGB member
who organized the banquet with
board member Anastasia
Kawalec, praised the leaders for
their dedication to the university.

”You have given of yourself,
and you have learned many
things outside the classroom,”
she said. O V J

”The leadership, organization-
al skills and personal relation-
ships we enjoy are much better
than just [for a resume’s sake],”
Klein added.

Klein and Kawalec presented
awards to student leaders who
earned special recognition.

Michael Neuman and Orfeu
Buxton, members of the lacrosse
team, received the outstanding
leaders of a sports club award.

The outstanding new program
award was given to the Pan-
hellenic Council, for its inter-
sorority mixer program.

Sherri Brandis of the Collegiate
YMCA, and Wilhemina Tarpeh of
Gamma Sigma Sigma received
awards for being outstanding
members of service programs.

The outstanding service pro-
gram honor was given to the col-
legiate YMCA for its alternative
spring break program.

The Angela Davis lecture,
which was sponsored by -the
Black Action Society, was given
the outstanding lecture award. '

The outstanding project award
went to the Black Interconnection
Network. J

Charles Farinella, former Inter-
fraternity Council president, was

NOW evaluates success of ’choice’ral|y

By Betty Sarafin
Staff Writer

One day after the March for
Women's Equality/Women's
Lives, the phones have not
stopped ringing at the Pennsylva-
nia state headquarters of the Na-
tional Organization for Women,
according to Cindy Judd Hill,
NOW state executive board
member. - '

’’It is hard to believe that the

Supreme Court and our govern-
ment could ignore this outpour-
ing of people who truly care
about women and their dignitygto
decide when and how to bear
children. We must stand up and

speak out for this freedom of’

choice,” said Hill.

There was a totaljof 20 buses
and approximately 800 people
from the Pittsburgh chapters of
NOW attending the March 9 ral-

ly. An equal or greater number
drove _in cars to attend, Hill
added.

”This is the biggest march that
NOW has organized," stated
Hill. ”Diverse organizations from
church groups, Planned Parent-
hood and the League of Women
Voters participated en-
thusiastically.”

The national office of NOW is
experiencing —a delay in reaction

because of a planned Lobbying
Day, said Susan Williams, assis-
tant press secretary. The state

-presidents and other representa-

tives of NOW will be returning
to Capitol Hill to talk with sena-
tors and state representatives
about issues that affect women's
lives. They will not only be dis-
cussing abortion, but also other‘
issues such as child care, pay eq-
uity and women's health care.

Students react to activitiesfee reserve fund

By Mindy Boffemmyer

News Editor ,

Last week, the Student Activi-
ties Capital and Program Reserve
was a hot topic of debate.

Approximately $42,000 re-
mains in the fund, which was
started in 1985 for the purpose of
purchasing a gift for Pitt's 1987
bicentennial. The Student
Government Board took a vote
and decided to purchase the
neon sculpture that currently
decorates the William Pitt Union.

So what's the debate?

The money collected for the
reserve fund was taken from the
$32 included annually in every
Pitt student's tuition bill. Money

n

allocated to a student organiza-
tion but not spent is placed in the
reserve fund. .

Some students are’ asking,
”What about the 42 grand?”
Others are wondering why they
are not permitted a ”say-so” in
deciding how to spend the
money.

The Pitt News conducted an in-
formal survey asking students
what they think the money
should be used for.

One student suggested that the
SGB purchase a wide screen TV
for the television room in the stu-
dent union. Another proposed a
fountain for the back lawn of the
Cathedral of Learning.

Both students wondered why

the SGB had not solicited their
opinions.
’’If we elect them into positions

‘of responsibility, then they

should be doing something for
us,” was one student response.

Campus safety concerns have
prompted some South Oakland
residents to wonder why a sec-
ond campus bus hasn't been pur-
chased to service their
neighborhood.

One female student, a South
Oakland resident, expressed her
concern about walking home at
night due to the recent incidents
of assault that have occurred in
Oakland. ‘

’’I don't understand why there
isn't a campus bus for South Oak-

land when it's more dangerous
than North Oakland. If the Stu-
dent Government Board has so
much extra money l_ying around, ’
why don't they buy another bus?
That sculpture isn't helping any-
one. A new bus would,” she said.

Other suggestions included hir-
ing speakers who would appeal
to a wider variety of students, and

lowering the student activities fee _

to compensate for the funds not
beingused.

SGB President Kent Baldauf
was unavailable for comment on
the matter.

The survey was conducted by
The Pitt News on April>5 and 6.

Fusion research may
yield a lot of energy

Texas A&M University is reporting a major break-
through in the field of atomic energy. It may have
produced a nuclear fusion reaction in a jar of heavy
water.

Current nuclear power plants produce atomic ener-
gy by the process of fission — the splitting of atoms to
release energy. But fission is flawed as an application
for producing usable energy in that it produces radio-
active waste and can produce a potentially dangerous
result — overheating the reactor core, resulting in a melt-
down, which can lead to the escape of radioactive water
used to cool the reactor and thus an escape of residual
radiation, all due to faulty sealants or human error.

Fusion, if perfected, could be a substantially safer and
more economical procedure. Two atoms are fused
together to form a different element. The most common
substance used in fusion is hydrogen, which is fused
to another hydrogen atom to form helium, releasing a
great deal of energy in the process. The energy of the
sun is produced by thermonuclear fusion.

Until now, producing fusion on earth has involved
a great deal of initial energy to start the reaction — more
energy, in fact, than the reaction yielded.

The new process, discovered at Texas A&M, is sim-
pler. Electrodes are inserted into a jar of heavy water,
which causes hydrogen to accumulate next to one elec-
trode, oxygen by the other. In heavy water, the hydro-
gen is atomically heavier than in regular water, and
theoretically, the atoms cluster so close together that
they fuse. The energy output is about 5 percent more
than the input.

This is a possible solution to energy problems for the
future. There is a virtually inexhaustible supply of fuel,
and there is much energy to be gained. There is also i
a bonus, in that fusion is a clean process, leaving no
radioactive waste. As long as the paranoia about nuclear
energy that has persisted for so long does not prevent
the implementation of this power source before it be-
gins, we can see the end of all energy crises ap-
proaching.

 

child of a drug addict? I-Iggy about

PERSPECTIVES ON ABORTION:

By Lou Grieco

One night about two years ago,
I was watching a film called Twist
and Shout at the Pittsburgh Play-
house. The movie was about what
it was like to grow up in Scandina-
via in the early 1960s.

I don’t remember much about the
movie, though there is one scene
that sticks in my mind. One of the
main characters, a teenage boy,
takes his pregnant girlfriend to get
an abortion.

They didn’t show much in the
abortion scene, but what they did
show was horrifying. The "doctor”
was some unqualified old lady. The
"clinic” was her house.

While the girl lay waiting on the
kitchen table, the old lady heated up
a sharpened piece of metal, several
feet long, over the stove. The scene
ended as the old lady began to prod
around inside the girl’s vagina.

Needless to say, I was appalled.
Chills ran down my spine. I was ex-
tremely thankful when the scene
ended.

Unfortunately, this type of medi-
cal (I use the term loosely) proce-
dure was fairly common in this
country up until the Roe vs. Wade
ruling on _]an. 22, 1973, when the
U.S. Supreme Court legalized abor-
tion. Now, with the high court
scheduled to hear an appeal of a
Missouri case, there is a chance that
Roe will be overturned.

This, of course, would quickly
bring back the type of procedure I
described above in any state that
decided to make abortion illegal.

Right about now, the pro-lifers will
accuse me of using "scare tactics.”
And they’re absolutely right. The
thought of any woman having to go

through what that scene depicted‘

should scare the living hell out of
anyone.

"Of course, the pro-life lobby never
uses scare tactics. A few years ago,
someone made a film called Silent
Scream, which showed a fetus be-
ing aborted. It was never mentioned
that the film’s producers distorted
the speed of the film so that it would
look like a fetus was screaming.

These people who represent "life”
also like to ignore the bombings of
abortion clinics, or the harassment
of the employees of these clinics.
They don’t like to mention incidents
like the three shotgun blasts fired at
the home of Norma McCorvey —
otherwise known as Jane Roe — on
April 4.

But enough of this petty bourgeois
fun." The fact is, if women’s rights
are to be preserved, abortion must
stay legal.

Of course, some will say that
women with unwanted pregnancies
shouldn’t have gotten that way in the
first place. Now that's solving a
problem. Anyway, many who do
take the necessary precautions find
themselves pregnant. No birth con-
trol method is IOQ percent effective,
except abstinence. In their perfect
little world, the religious zealots ex-
pect everyone to abstain from sex
until marriage, and then contribute
to the populating of the planet,
regardless of personal finances.

Adoption is the biggest gun in the
pro-life lobby’s artillery. And, as
they say, there are plenty of people
who are looking to adopt a child.

But would they want to adopt the

PART 2 OF 3

the baby of an AIDS patient,‘ or a
mentally retarded child? Another
consideration is race. Would these
adoptive parents be willing to accept
a minority child?

Every year, as many as 6 million
couples want to adopt a healthy,
white baby. Only 34 percent of all
children available for adoption each
year fit into this category. Blacks
and other minorities, older children,
sick and handicapped children make
up the other 66 percent. These chil-
dren are far less likely to be adopt-
ed than their fortunate healthy white
peers. i

Another thing not considered by
pro-lifers is the huge influx of chil-
dren that will be produced if abor-
tion becomes illegal. While there
may be enough adoptive parents to-
day, are there enough to take in all
of the children who will be born? Or
will they get to sit in orphanages and
foster homes?

Besides, many women would
prefer abortion over adoption for

besides
another pro-life
favorite. My mother’s support for
the right to choose comes from the
fact that she feels it would be more

considerations "con-

venience” —

traumatic to carry a child for nine‘
' months and give it up than to abort

it early in the pregnancy.

Yet, as they have ignored other
considerations, the zealots who op-
pose abortion ignore women who
literally can’t afford to bepregnant:
women who already have more kids
than they can feed; women who can’t
take the time off work, even if they
give the child up for adoption, be-
cause the place at which they work
doesn’t offer maternity. leave.

Eliminating abortion as an option
leaves no choice for some women.
Basically, it is the poor who will be
hurt, because wealthier women will
obviously have the money to avoid
these problems or travel abroad to

get an abortion. But conservative

Republicans, who don’t represent
the poor, regardless of rhetoric,
don’t worry about that as they count
up votes from the religious right.

The bottom line is: Women can-

not afford to lose the right to
choose.

Many a louse has walked away
from a pregnant girlfriend. Because
of anatomical differences, men will

always have the privilege of walking.

away from a pregnancy. Like it or
not, abortion is the only way to give
women equality in matters of
pregnancy.

Of course, a woman can sue a
man for child support. But that, too,

costs money. As usual, the poor will in

be left in the cold.

The anti-abortionists will now say
that I have obviously ignored a cer-
tain party in my argument, that be-
ing the unborn. The fact is, the term
"pro—life” is very misleading. In ac-

tuality, these people are "pro-birth.” .

What happens to the child after
birth is not really the concern of the
anti-abortion lobby. Whether or not
the child is neglected, molested,
beaten, abandoned in a crack house
(this happened to an infant in the
Hill district last week), or otherwise

abused is not an issue for these peo-

' ple. The point is, the child was

"saved.”

From this point on, it is the child’s
responsibility to survive whatever
atrocities come into his life. Since

many pro-lifers are ‘Republicans, _

they often fail to support programs
to help children in need.
Granted, they do believe in

prosecuting molesters‘ and other

_ scum. But often enough, Republi-' 1‘

cans vote against aid for rehabilita-
tion and support groups. Wasn’t it
Ronald Reagan who talked of "in-
dividual responsibility”?

Thefact is, there is a good chance
that the juvenile drug abuser, the
guy who beat your wife and stole her
purse, the kid who committed sui-
cide, andeveri the teen mother her-

self wereall unwanted children. But

no one in the pro-life lobby wants
to admit that.

There are those in the ranks of
. Operation Rescue who will say that
I don’t care about the unborn. The
truth is, they don’t care about the
born.

. Coping on campus

Anxiety over public speaking a correctable problem

What can a person do about
public speaking anxiety? I am so
frightenedvby it that I drop any
course where there is a chance
that I might have to get up and
speak.

Public speaking anxiety is a
major concern of many students.
According to a recent survey con-
ducted at Pitt, one out of every
two undergraduate students and
more than one of three graduate
students are speech-anxious.

One of the unfortunate side ef-
fects of this problem is that many
students, like yourself, avoid tak-
ing classes that they might other-
wise enjoy because the class
requires an oral presentation.

Some students even plan their
entire academic curriculum to
avoid having to speak in class,
and countless others have cheat-

 

ed themselves of promising
career possibilities because of this
fear.

This is unfortunate since most
learning theorists believe that
speech anxiety is a learned habit
which can be unlearned.

DR. ROBERT
GALLAGHER

The problem is complex,
however, since the personalities
of speech-anxious students differ
considerably.

Some, for example, are out-
spoken and gregarious individu-
als who express themselves well
in most situations, yet are quite
phobic about formal public
speaking.

Coupon Clipper

The PITT NEWS o April ii," 1989

Others are reticent, unassertive
and anxious people who have
difficulty expressing themselves
in many social situations. The
former student is probably best
advised to confront the problem
directly and take every opportu-
nity to speak in a formal setting.

One possibility might be to
take a public speaking class in
Pitt's Informal Studies Program,
or with an outside group such as
Dale Carnegie (this can be fairly
expensive for students), or the
Toastmasters Club. All of these
programs have much experience
in working with speech-anxious
people and have had many suc-
cessful graduates. -

Such activities may also be
helpful for the more reticent and
unassertive student, but these in-
dividuals may first need to em-
bark on a broader social—skills

It is not clear from your ques-

fall. Consequently, it may be
helpful for you to consult a
professional counselor or a
speech therapist to assess the
specific nature of your problem,
and then to plan a course of
action.

Many people (even shy ones)
who work at it can overcome
public speaking anxiety in a rela-
tively short period of time. Others
will show gradual progress over

a number of years, and some will
struggle with it for a lifetime. The
rewards for success are signifi-
cant, so it is a struggle worth mak-

Walker returns after injury-filled season

By Chris Bosak

Staff Writer

Remember how the Pitt foot-
ball team started last season with
a 2-0 record? Remember how
Pitt's offense was averaging 480
yards in those games?

Now, do you remember who
had 327 yards rushing for Pitt in
those games, more yards in those
first two games than any other Pitt
running back ih history?

No, it wasn't Curvin Richards,
who led Pitt with 1,228 yards

b rushing last year.

It was Adam Walker. The
6-foot-3, I92-pound running
back combined his power with
his slashing moves to average 8.0
yards per carry in Pitt's first two
games. Walker also had five
touchdowns in those games, in-
cluding a 89-yarder against
Northern Iowa.

But, just as Walker was getting
off to a brilliant start, he twisted
his ankle against Boston College,
the fourth game of the season.

Richards replaced Walker in
the game and rushed for 202
yards. Walker's performances
seem to have been forgotten in
the wake of Richards’ outstand-
ing year.

But Walker is determined to
make people remember him. His
ankle is ”IOO percent,” and he is
setting his goals high for his
senior year and won't settle for
anything less.

’’I want to get better as an in-
dividual, as a group of running
backs, and as a team,” said Walk-
er. ’’I want the national champi-
onship and the Heisman Trophy,

the whole nine yards._”
Please see Walker, page 13

Viet Phorn/The Pitt News

Pitt running back Adam Walker, seen here accepting a hand-off early last season, is hoping to make a strong comeback in '89. A

Due to the tremendous
deluge of protesting letters and
hostile, threatening phone
calls, we unidentified people
here at The Pitt News have
come to feel that the literate
public deserves a formal apol-
ogy for the ridiculous remark
that Thomas Danyluk made
concerning the legalization of

aluminum bats in major

league baseball, which ap-
peared in last Tuesday's issue.

' Baseball has not legalized alu-
minum bats.

Any further unusual blun-
ders by Mr. Danyluk, and we
will dig out all of the hair of
any ”O” employee of the pub-
/ic’s choice with a dandelion
digger. Tom?

‘ Ahh, yeah. Okay, I am real-
ly, really sorry for irritating the
extra-alert thousands of you
who freaked out at the lunch
table when you read ”Jose
Canseco using an aluminum
bat is to major league baseball
what Ivan Lencll...” with the
howitzer and all that.

Baseball and April
Fools Day seem to
be closely linked  

to be on the lookout for
intelligence—insulting errors.
And for the remaining gullible
folk who believed it as much
as I did, here's the deal:

I should say that I did it on
purpose, you know, just a joke
to get the aforementioned
result; but in the newspaper
business, that's equivalent to
walking around Pizza Hut
with your fly down and your
shirt tail peeking out the front,
then trying to get out of it by
saying you were in a silly,
goofing-around mood and
meant to do it...

Anyway, the TV show Inside
Baseball ran a segment on
how the major leagues are al-
lowing aluminum bats to be
used during the I989 season.
Complete with angry player
reactions with pitchers Bert

_ Blyleven and Steve Bedrosian ,

and happy player interviews
with sluggers Canseco and
Mark McGwire. The whole
bit. Whoa, this is big, a great
idea for a column, I thought.

And as I was getting a drink
of water in the hall, ’’April
Fools’’ was plastered up on the
screen.

Oh, yeah. April 1st. It didn't

Penguins’ style will have to change
before roundtwo begins, or else...

By. Mike Rampa
Staff Writer

Well, I will be cow-kicked!

The Penguins just finished
playing four of the tightest, most
well-balanced games of their sea-
son as they swept the Rangers
over the weekend.

The Pens received excellent
goal production from members of

the team other than Mario’

Lemieux, which proved to be an
integral key to their success.

While Lucien DeB|ois was
busy shadowing Lemieux, Ray
Bourque, Randy Cunneyworth,
Kevin Stevens, Paul Coffey and
Zarley Zalapski were busy stuff-
ing the puck past all three of the
goalies that Phil Esposito used to
try and stop the relentless Pen-
guin attack.

In all four games, the Penguins
built a comfortable lead and then
slipped back into a defensive
shell. They were content to stay
behind their own blue line and
dish the puck back into the neu-
tral zone or into the Ranger zone.

It worked. But it's not going to
work against the Flyers or the
Capitals — especially the Flyers.

If anyone noticed, the Penguins
won their games fairly comforta-
bly, but failed to capitalize on a
lot of scoring opportunities.

Over the weekend, Lemieux
blew three breakaway opportuni-

,

an open net. Rob Brown could
not lift the puck over a rookie

- goalie (Mike Richter) who was

horizontal on the ice with no
stick. And both Stevens and Jock
Callander got stuffed on two-on-
one breakaways.

ANALYSIS  

-ties. Coffey hit the post twice on _

 

.The Penguins had many
chances not only to put the
games away early on, but to take
the spirit out of and any hope of
winning from the Rangers on
their home ice. They failed on
these few crucial opportunites,
and, as a result, the Rangers
fought back to within a goal Sun-
day night and kept it close.

The mark of a championship

team is forplayers to be able to '

capitalize on crucial scoring op-
portunities, not to get them back
into the game, but to take their
opponents out of the game emo-
tionally. If the Penguins are to
succeed in round two, they must

' start putting the biscuit in the net

even when they don't have to, so
they won't have to later in the
contest.

On a different note: Many of
the goals scored by both the Pens
and the Rangers were on fairly
long-range slap-shots.

Coffey blistered his two netters
from almost 45 feet out. ‘

Brian Leetch-beat'Torn Balrras-,2.

 

so, who was unscreened, from

"just inside the blue line on Sun-
day night.‘

And Guy Lafleur also beat Bar-
rasso to the glove side from 30
feet.out.'

Barrasso was quite successful at
stopping the Rangers when they
tried to score in front of the net
or from shorter distances.

However, with Washington or
Philly, the Pens will have to con-
tend not only with long-range
shots,» but with a much more dan-
gerous short game. - .

The Flyers are deadly «on the
power play. They storm the op-
ponent's net relentlessly and ag-

gressively, and if finesse doesn't

produce goals for them, ‘then
sheer force and maybe a lucky
bounce or two do. _ c

If they can't . get their short
game going, they'll dish it to the
left or right point so Rick Tocchet
can.fire a slap shot.

And with the size of Tim Kerr
and the likes of other members of
the Philly lines, the Penguin
defensemen will have their hands
full in front of the net.

Barrasso, arguably the°\best
goaltender in the Patrick Divi-
sion, will eventually break down
slightly if the Pens keep allowing
over 40 shots a game.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, April ll, 1989

Maybe the fans put sports heroes
on too high and unsteady a pedestal

Here is a little story for every-
body out there.

There was once a football play-
er whom the ownership didn't
like. He was one of the best on
the team, but this team had a lot
of good players. We’ll call him
Bob.

 

VINCE
CAREY

The team had certain rules
when they were on the road.
One of them was that players had
to keep tabs with the office secre-
tary so that if anyone happened
to get into trouble, the team
would know how to help him.

Bob never caused much trou-
ble. He tried to do his job the
best that he could and received
more than a few congratulatory
handshakes on what a fine job it
was.

One day, Bob couldn't get to
a phone, and it just happened
that on this day, Bob gotvinto a
little trouble. ’ ‘

The next day the team received
a call from local authorities ex~
plaining that Bob had been in-
volved in some trouble.

The secretary, knowing that
Bob was in his last year, decided
to take matters into her own
hands. She, in ‘effect, told the
authorities to let him rot." She had
never liked Bob anyway. As a
result, Bob didn't like her.

He had never felt worse in his
professional life. He wanted to
kill that secretary.

Maybe this is the way that Scott
Hoch felt during the first extra
hole in the Masters, Sunday after-
noon. Everything he ever wanted
in life was in front of him. All that

stood in his way was a two-foot —

putt.

Probably one that he has made
a number of times before. He has
probably been able to make that
putt since he was 10 years old.

Yet, on a cold, rainy day in
April, Scott Hoch didn't have a
chance.

There was nobody around to
help him. Nobody to console
him after his loss.

There he was, all alone, in front
of millions of people (thanks to
the magic of television). They all
watched as Scott Hoch knocked

, » the putt to the right of the cup. It
9 wasn't a happy scene.

Maybe this is the problem with

the sports world today. There is
too much pressure put on some-
thing as small as a two-foot putt.

Not to take anything away from
winner Nick Faldo, but Scott
Hoch isn't a loser. In a driving
rainstorm, he completed almost
two rounds of golf in one day,
only to lose the most prestigious
golf tournament in the world.

Now, nobody will remember
him for what he actually did. He
had Americans sitting on the
edge of their seats, hoping that
putt would fall in, only to sigh
when it lipped out.

9

So what if he didn't make the
ball drop? It doesn't matter if the
Pirates shortstop can't hit the ball.

Who cares if Louis Lipps drops-

passes like the ball was coated in
butter?

Watch sports for what they are.
Just entertainment. A bad perfor-
mance is not the end of the
world.

It doesn't really matter if Scott
Hoch ever wins another tourna-
ment in his life. He will forever
be remembered as the ”guy who
couldn't sink the two-foot putt.”

Head coach Debbie Yohman
said the gymnasts would have
surpassed Temple if a few falls on
beam weren't counted. Beam
was the event with which Pitt
started the competition.

”The scores did start out tight
on beam, but the kids worked
slow and cautious/.’ Yohman
said.

Although the majority of the
Lady Panthers hit their beam rou-
tines, the scores were low due to
the fact that Pitt was the first team
up in the entire competition, and
scores, for the mo_st part, started

 

from senior Trish Aser with an
8.75.

However, the rest of Pitt's
scores on the remaining three
events were ”at or above aver-
age,” according to Yohman.

On floor exercise, Aser started
out strong for the Lady Panthers
with a clean routine, scoring 9.1.

Freshman Jen Butkovich and
sophomores Carrie Carnesale and
Kathy Wallish all scored 9.0 for
their floor performances.

Freshman Gina Venezia and
sophomore Tina Taylor were
Pitt's high scorers on floor with a
9.25 and a 9.4, respectively.
Aser once again set the pace for

 

stronger events in the compe-
tition.

Taylor started off with an 8.65,
Venezia hit for a 9.0 and junior
captain Shelly Sleith received an
8.95 on the unevens.

Carnesale and Butkovich each
hit their bar sets for a 9.15‘and
9.2, respectively.

Overal|,«Yohman was pleased
with the team's sixth—place finish.

’’I couldn't have been prouder
of the kids,” she said. ”We com-
peted 100 percent better and
moved up a place from where we
were seeded.”

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, April 11, 1989

. Haynes should be an impact player at college

«Q?

 

By Alan Robinson

AP Sports Writer

For a player from such a small
school, Jonathan Haynes already
has made a big, big impact on
Philadelphia high school
basketball. V

Want statistical proof? Just look
at these big-league numbers the
Germantown Friends School
junior has produced in two
scholastic seasons:

0 A 19.5 points per game scor-
ing average on a 21-5 team as a
sophomore.

0 Averages of 30.5 points,
seven assists and five steals a
game this season on a 19-6 team
that replaced 12 of its top 16
players from a year ago.

0 A 37-point, 11-assist, 9-steal
game in a 91-79 victory over
Cardinal Dougherty.

0 Season highs of 43 points
and 15 steals.

0 A 3.0 grade point average.

If those numbers don't impress
you, how about these names:
Georgetown, Temple, Arizona,

 

Iowa and Notre Dame. They are
among the NCAA Division I
powers that are interested in
Haynes, who began his scholas-
tic career in 1986 as a Rox-
borough High School junior
varsity player.

Those names and numbers
were enough to convince state
sports writers and sportscasters to

' select the 6-foot-3 Haynes as The

Associated Press Small School
Player of the Year for 1989. Play-
ers from Class AA and Class A
schools were eligible.

"This is great for Jonathan and
great for our program,” German-
town Friends Coach Alfred John-
son said. "It's easy for a coach to
say great things about a player
likeJonathan, but he really, truly
is a super talent. He's a good
player now, and he wants to get
even better.”

Haynes isn't bad right now —
just ask Ridley, Germantown,
and Monsignor Bonner, some of
the big schools that became vic-
tims of Haynes’ brand of small-
school magic this season.

Haynes scored 68 points as
Germantown Friends upset Bon-
ner, the defending Philadelphia
Catholic League champion, and
Ridley on consecutive nights to
win the Ridley tournament.

”What any coach would like
about Jonathan is the way he
works, the way he wants to im-
prove himself,” Johnson said.
"He was good last season, but I
told him he needed some work
on his jump shot. Last summer,
he shot 800 jumpers a day, went
to the B.C. All-Star camp, worked
on his passing.” _

Haynes has benefited from
Germantown Friends’ uptempo
style, which emphasizes tight
man-to—man defense and a fast-
break, but not helter—skelter,
offense.

Johnson likes his team to
spread the floor and allow
Haynes, a second-team all-city
pick by the Philadelphia Daily
News, to operate in traffic or pass
off to 6-5 Malik Nagel, who aver-
aged 16.7 points and 1 re-
bounds a game. '

    

"Jonathan's going to get even
better,” Johnson said. "He's go-
ing to go to the Five-Star camp
this summer and he hopes to be
invited to the Nike camp. He's a
good student who works hard on
his academics, and he will be a
Proposition 48 qualifier.

"We’re a small school that likes
to play the best possible compe-
tition, and we're talking to [USA
Today national champion] St. An-
thony's of Jersey City about a
game next season.”

Johnson, who has known
Haynes since he was a fourth
grader, said his star guard decid-
ed two years ago to escape the
inner—city school environment
and enroll in a smaller school
with stricter academic guidelines.

"We tell our players that we
haven't produced any NBA’ play-
ers, but we've produced many,
many successful people in all\
walks of life," Johnson said.
"Jonathan is the type of student,
and athlete, who has benefited
from attending a smaller school.
We play the big schools in

basketball, but he gets individu-
al attention here he might not get
in a bigger school.

"He has handled everything
well: basketball, academics, get-
ting along with his teammates. I
guarantee you that everybody in
the [Philadelphia] Public League
knows about him and would like
to have him." ~

— of scholarship money by sign-
ing the athletes to contracts that
violated NCAA rules.

Defense attorneys argued that
universities often kept athletes in
school, despite poor grades, to
promote their sports programs.
They said Walters and Bloom
were the victims of ”double-
dealing” athletes who took their
money and later backed out of

the deals.

Attorneys for Walters and
Bloom also said the defendants
were merely engaging in prac-
tices long accepted in the sports
world.

NFL players who testified at the
trial included Ronnie Harmon of
Buffalo, Paul Palmer of Kansas
City and Mark Ingram of New
York. They are among the 43
players who signed with Walters
and Bloom and avoided prosecu-

tion with pretrial agreements to
perform community service and
reimburse portions of their
scholarships to their universities.

Fourteen states already have
laws or proposed legislation that
would make it aycrime to pass
money to athletes before their
college eligibility has expired,
Zucker said.

up, Lemieux fulfilled" his new-
found defensive role exception-
ally well, and the offense outmus—
Cled the Rangers in their own end
and consistently beat them to the
puck.

The Pens may have to alter the
defensive shell strategy in round
two. Both the Capitals and the
Flyers are capable of destroying
teams which settle for two— or
three-goal leads midway through
the second period.

The Penguins must capitalize

Walker

on the goal-scoring opportunities
that they are afforded by oppo-
nents’ miscues in order to secure
games in which they have the
lead. Give the Flyers or the Caps
a chance to come back, and they
will. ' _

Also, the Pens must remain ag-
gressive, especially in the fore-
checking department to keep
control of the puck in the oppo-
nent's zone.

Perhaps most important, the‘

Pens must continue to hit hard all
over the ice and must mix it up

with the gloves off occasionally.
The entire Ranger team was
demoralized and played much
more tentatively when Phil Bour-
que dropped Mark Hardy to the
ice with a nice left-hand shot.

The Penguins have all the tools
in their possession for a success-
ful second round. They are cer-
tainly playing p|ayoff—caliber
hockey. They just may have to do
some things a little differently to
be successful against the Flyers or
the Caps.

Continued from page 8
To do that Walker is going to
have to see substantial playing
time, which may be a problem.

Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried 7

didn't say exactly how he willuse
Walker and Richards, _but he said
they will both see a lot of time.

For now, Walker has to wait to
see what happens, but he is keep-
ing a level head about the sit-
uation.

”The coaches are going to de-
termine the playing time,” said
Walker. ’’I’m just going to prac-

tice with everything I have and,
hopefully, get my starting job
back.” A

Last year, the Pitt offense did a
lot of running behind All-

American guard Mark Stepnoski ,

and tackle Tom Ricketts. With
Stepnoski and Ricketts graduat-
ing, the running game will have
to find other linemen to pave the
way.

”We’re going to miss Stepnoski
and Ricketts, but Bill Cherpak
and Scott Miller are stepping in,

- so we aren't going to miss a beat.

We'll have a powerful offense,”
said Walker.

Walker also said there will be
other changes in the team besides
new players in some positions. A
new attitude has been instilled
that will lead to positive things.

”We plan on being better men-
tally prepared,” said Walker.
”We have a better disciplined
team, and we'll make fewer mis-
takes, [and] with that we'll be un-
stoppable.”

dawn on me until 500 guys
(believe it or not, no ladies
picked up on the misprint) that
I know ”dawned” it on my
head with their heckling.

A wise man once said,

”Fools’ rules, nobody wins.”-

But that wasn't the first time
I got suckered by a baseball
gag on April Fools’ Day. Oh
no, I've fallen for better ones
than that. Remember the
Sports Illustrated feature by
George Plimpton on a remark-
able but bizarre upcoming
New York Mets pitcher named
Siddhartha (Sidd) Finch? The
guy who could throw a fastball
150 miles an hour with dead-
ly accuracy?

...Came out in the April 1,
1985 issue.

...Told all kinds of kids’
about Finch... What a player...
Bought that one hook, line,
sinker and half an Ugly Stik, .
too.

But don't worry; I've learned
my lesson. Next April 1st
when I see the special report
on A Current Affair about
Geoge Steinbrenner actually
being a bootie-knitting trans-
vestite skinhead who lives in
a six-bedroom New York
apartment with Amelia
Earhart, you won't be reading

’ about it in my column.
