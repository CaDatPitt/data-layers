SGB Sees Woyfor Pitt to Lead Student Lobbying

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt has the potential to take the
lead in statewide student lobbying
procedures, according to Student
Government Board member Stan
Galanski.

Galanski believes Pitt could lead
the push for effective lobbying in
Harrisburg because of the SGB’s
ﬁnancial situation.

‘ ‘The positionVPitt is in is amazing
with regards to the other state-re-
lated schools,” Galanski said.
“The Pitt Student Government
theoretically has access to about
$300,000 in student activities fees.
Penn State’s Student Board only
has access to about $30,000. That
limits them in what they can do.”

The Temple University Board
does not have access to a student

activity fee.

“It’s outlawed by their charter,”
Galanski said. “The only way they
can get funding is through . the
Board of Trustees which makes

them subject, possibly, to control of“

the.Board or difficulties in getting
money.” '

Galanski indicated Lincoln Uni-_

versity’s problem is size.

‘ ‘Lincoln is a small school. That is
basically their problem,” he said.
“They only have about 1,000

Two men are arguing over a

both men without ‘asking any
questions or resolve the conflict in a
peaceful manner.

‘According to Charles West-
brooks, Pitt’s campus police officers
will always choose the latter
alternative.

“Talking over problems when
they arise or possibly eliminating
them before they start is part of the
ongoing community relations pro-
gram in the department,” he said.

the community we serve.”
“The patrolman is an integral

effort because he makes the contact
with the public, ” he continued.

“And that first contact could leave a
lasting impression. People often

;' have had bad experiences with cops

and are left cynical and suspicious.
That’s why poor conduct on the part
of an officer could destroy any
community relations effort.”
Westbrooks said the effort must
“start at the top.” He credits not
only the entire campus police staff,

Analysis Begins On
Pitt Counseling Survey

By DAVE KIRSHNER

Analysis has begun on the results of a survey on the counseling
demands of Pitt's student population, according to Dr. Robert P.
Gallagher, director of the University Counseling Service.

The study, conducted during the 1977 winter term, asked both —

undergraduate and graduate students to indicate problem areas under
headings of Career Development and Placement, Learning Skills, and

Personal Concerns.

Gallagher said he was “fairly comfortable” with the data obtained
from the random sample of 10 percent of the students on the Oakland

campus. . V

The findings are being forwarded to various members of the
University staff for evaluation and possible action, he said. V

More than half of the 785 students who responded said they need
more job-related information and would favor a one-credit course.
assisting preparation for entrance into the job market or graduate

school.

“The interest expressed in the Career Development and Placement
concerns was high, as expected,’ ’ Gallagher said. “No matter how well
students function academically, or personally, the need to progress
towards some career goal seems to be almost universal among college

students . ’ ’

In addition to‘ showing approval of a course ‘that aids graduating
students, the survey revealed that 80 percent would like to see a course
or structured group to help all new students adjust to the campus.

“Everybody kind of knows students ﬂounder in the beginning,”

Bruce Hall

(Conrirruedjro/n Page I)

According to Tim Snyder, F
assistant to the director of the
Office of Residence Life, the Bruce
Hall residence will consist of three
suites housing four students each,
one housing ﬁve, one suite with
accomodations for six residents and
one large eight-person suite for
each of the eight ﬂoors being
utilized. The suites will consist of
double bedrooms, a bath, a
kitchenette, and -a living room with
new furniture and carpeting.

Within Bruce Hall will be a new
Alternative Lifestyle program cal-
led the International Unit. The unit
will consume 3 ﬂoors or 18 suites of
the new dormitory. Slots in the
new living unit may be secured by
applying to the Office of New
Student Services. The program is
open to all American and foreign.
undergraduates. An equal number
of American and foreign under-
graduates of both sexes will be
selected for the program.

“I encourage students with an
interest in a career in international
affairs, the peace corps or plans for
travel abroad to look into the
program,” said Ralph Morrison
director of the Office of Interna-
tional Student Services and coor-
dinator of the International Unit.

A similar program coordinated
by Morrison in 1970 at the State
University of new York at Stony
Brook was termed a “marvelous
success” by Morrison.

The Forbes Pavillion was pur-
chased by the University earlier
this year. Four ﬂoors of the Forbes
Pavillion will consist primarily of
two double rooms connected by a
bathroom with a centralized shower
facility and a_ large lounge on each
ﬂoor.

Resident students will be housed
on ﬂoors 3 thru 6 with the use of the

‘(Counseling Survey

(Cmiriniiedfroni Page I)
‘Gallagher said. “Information has been sent to the advising center.
We’re awaiting their action.”

Students also expressed a general interest in improving their
learning skills, especially their reading speed.

Gallagher says in his summary of the study, “There seems to be a
pervasive need among students to gain more control over their
pressured lives by reading both required and elective materials faster.
The survey reveals that this is shared by students at all levels of the
_ university.’

He added that although graduate students are usually more
confident of their academic abilities in areas such as test preparation,
test anxiety, general reading skills, and research paper writing, 70
percent still expressed a need for assistance in at least one of these skill
areas.

More than 91 percent of those surveyed requested information
dealing with one or more of the items listed under “Personal
Concerns.”

“The most prevalent concern in this area, among all groups, is
public speaking anxiety,” Gallagher said. “It’s mostly a lack of
experience.”

“Students are avoiding certain majors and courses,” he said. “We

have people working very hard not to get an education in the areas

;where they really need it.” _

Fear of failure ranked high among all sections surveyed, as was
concern with ﬁnding more purpose in life. The problems of loneliness,
depression, lack of self-esteem and assertiveness “provide an
indication that campus life is indeed stressful to a fairly large number
of students,” according to Gallagher’s report.

Almost 70 percent of the students favored help on a one-to-one basis.
Group counseling was the second choice.

Already, the Counseling Center had begun organization of eight

.>ti*'.1niversity-funded workshops to meet the demands of large numbers of

students.

Gallagher also has sent out a second, more speciﬁc survey to the
entire undergraduate population, in order to examine particular
students’ needs. '

ship.

“What we will see is action
beginning at Pitt now, hopefully,
that will establish us as having the
resources, the manpower, the
ﬁnances, and the political expertise
to be leaders in this effort,” said
Galanski.

He is confident the current task
force will become a standing
committee of the Board. The
current “Task Force for Higher
Education” would be renamed
“The Public Affairs/ Governmental
Relations Committee of the SGB.”

“It will be a strong committee,”
Galanski said. “What it will do is

lobby, register votes, deal with
matters of political and govern-
mental relations. It can happen on
the local level, things related to Pitt
students,
meters, lower tuition, or the PAT
situation. It can happen on the state
level with the legislative and the
gubernatorial races coming up, and
to a lesser extent on the national
level.”

The lobbying force from Pitt
would drive to Harrisburg, perhaps
every two weeks, to meet with
different legislators.

Galanski expressed hope the

Board would make the task force a -

standing committee in the near
future.

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

Counseling Survey

Under the present circumstances (i.e., impending tuition hikes),
budget constraints must be given serious consideration when the
expansion of student services is proposed. Limitations on Univer-
sity funding must mean limitations on non-essential, non-academic

programs ﬁrst.

Nevertheless, we are impressed by the steps being taken by Dr.
Robert Gallagher and the University Counseling Service as a result
of the recent survey on student's counseling needs.

The need for improved job acquisition training is acute. Many
students approach the search for a job after graduation with vir-
tually no experience in preparing resumes, interview procedure, etc.

The one-credit course under consideration as an aid to future job
seekers is a good idea. Four years of job preparation at Pitt are
worth much less without that initial “in.”

Although the other new initiatives being taken by the counseling
service are also good, budget considerations should weigh more
heavily in the decisions on whether to implement them.

Even under fiscal constraints, personal counseling services are
important, and we hope funds will be available for the full range of

proposed improvements in this area.

As the survey suggests,

students often suffer from loneliness and depression, among other
things. While the University Counseling Service cannot shoulder
the full burden for alleviating problems in this area, Pitt has a
responsibility to provide quality personal counseling services.

Student problems with reading speed, writing ability and public
speaking anxiety are serious, and the survey reveals interest in
programs directed to these kinds of needs. But, in many cases, they
can be handled by already existing services and classes.
Duplication of services is something none of us needs, and ap-
propriate care should be taken when approving new measures in

these areas.

Finally, problems of new students with adjustment to University
life are often short—lived, emphasis in the survey notwithstanding.
General counseling for students with severe problems should be
available, but improvements in orientation procedures might be a
better idea than new programs specifically designed to deal with

this rather universal anxiety.

Growth Ideology in Carter’s First Budget

By GARY GOVERT

Two weeks ago today, President
Carter presented Congress with his
ﬁrst Federal budget proposal, a
telephone book-size document pro-
jecting,Government outlaysiof over
one-half trillion dollars in ﬁscal year
1979.

It’s a large budget, to say the

‘least. In fact, as the President noted

in his accompanying message to
Congress, the new Federal budget
will be larger than the gross
national products (GNP) of all but

three nations. Still, Carter is said to
be proud he was able to hold the

' total spending increase to just eight

percent over last year’s budget-
two percent after inﬂation.
Unfortunately, there is little else
to be proud of. The zero-based
budgeting techniques imported by
the administration from Georgia
yielded zero paring of ' the
bulging Federal bureaucracy.
Deﬁcit spending, set at $60.6
billion. will reach its third highest

. level in history. jInﬂation—which

already represents half the GNP
when measured against 1965
dollars—will continue to tighten its
grip-

President Carter is not, of course,
solely to blame for the corpulence of
the Federal budget. It is extremely
difficult to reign in the spending
commitments made by one’s
predecessors, and the “uncontroll-
able” element in . government
ﬁnance -can drive an administrator
to despair.

Presently existing social welfare
programs, for instance, often
cannot help but grow incrementally.
Many appear to have been designed
to do just that. And pressure from
special interests not only calls new
programs into existence, it fattens
up old ones.

A comprehensive, area-by-area
analysis of the Federal budget is
beyond the ability (and probably the
interest) of the average student of
public policy. The budget’s sheer

Letters to the Editor

More Tips for Hillman Library Users

The lending staff at Hillman
Library wouldlike to commend Joni
Hurley for her letter and her good
suggestions for users of Hillman, as
they appeared in the Jan. 27, 1978
Pitt News.

If the computer sends you an
overdue notice that you don’t
deserve, please contact our friendly
staff in the lending department. We
will do all in our power to correct the
problem.

If you get a notice you do deserve,
please handle it as promptly as
possible. Don’t just drop the book
in one of the book bins because it
will then cost you a lot more.

It’s a good idea to follow all the

weight in paper is enough to
intimidate most mortals. Yet, a
brief contemplation of Carter’s
bulky ﬁscal scenario leaves one with
a few deﬁnite impressions.
Perhaps the most striking of
these impressions-albeit the most

predictable—is Carter’s whole- ‘

hearted endorsement of the conven-
tional wisdom regarding economic
growth. New York Times reporter
Clyde F amsworth has described the
President as “a ﬁscal conservative
whose basic philosophy is really not
too different from his Republican
predecessors.” As far as growth
ideology is concerned, Farnsworth
is right on the mark. ,

There is, of course, nothing
wrong with economic growth, as
long as it is not made an absolute
value-—and as long as it is not
equated with human growth. But
Carter apparently sees a contin-
uously growing GNP as the answer,

perhaps the only answer, to a whole .

raft of social problems, not the least
of which is unemployment. Never
mind the historical, environmental
and human evidence to the
contrary, the new budget says. The
system is the solution. An
innovative twist here, a little
socially motivated manipulation
there, and the engine of economic
growth will take us where we want
to go—wherever that is.

The President’s conventional
wisdom shows up most clearly in his
proposal for a $24.5 billion tax cut
designed to prime the economy
through increased consumer spend-
mg.

It is difﬁcult to determine
who—-or what—rnight beneﬁt from
a tax cut. Sections of the
middle-class may come out ahead in
some narrowly deﬁned way, or

recommendations made in Hurley’s
letter. In case you missed them,
they were:

1 . Keep a record of the books you
have checked out and when you

returned them.

2. Return books to the book bins

‘on the ground, floor and the ﬁrst

ﬂoor of Hillman Library.

3. Call the phone number listed
on the overdue notice as soon as you
receive the notice.

4. Ask that a search be put on the
book.

5. Ask the name of the staff
member taking the details.

6. If you do not get a response to
the search within a reasonable time,

perhaps a few Democratic con-
gressmen standing for re-election.
But, in general, it looks to be a bad
idea.

The environment, in some places
already victimized beyond repair by
our consumer society, can only lose.
More “consumption means more
production means more pollution-
and while new pollution control
technology might develop under the
impetus of increased consumer
spending and economic growth, it
can only be too little, too late.
Environmental technology simply
cannot keep pace with environmen-
tal deterioration in a consumption-
based, growth-ﬁrst economy.

Certainly the poor, who ought to
be the ﬁrst concern of government,
have little to gain from a tax cut.
An inner-city dweller whose
income is below the taxable level to
begin with, will find small
consolation in the size of his
suburban neighbor’s refund check.

There are those, of course, who
will argue that the economic shot in
the arm provided by increased
middle-class spending will even-
tually ﬁnd its way to the poor,
speciﬁcally in the form of jobs.

But new washing machines for
the affluent do not translate into
jobs for the chronically unemploy-
ed, no matter what the trickle-down
ideologues might have us believe.
An industrialized, highly mechan-
ized, technological economy--no
matter how much GNP it belches
out—does little, if anything, to
solve the problems of education and
motivation that confront the poor.
In fact, it does much to create
them.

There is, of course, more to the
budget than tax cuts. Energy
concerns occupy a prominent place,

contact the lending desk supervisor.
We would like to add a few more
suggestions. 

1. Do not lend—your ID badge to a
friend.

2. Do not let a friend borrow a
book already charged on your ID . In
spite of their good intentions,
friends cannot always be counted
upon to return books as promised,
or when promised. It’s your loan
and your responsibility.

devotion to economic growth, the
President has made some good
proposals. His" commitment to
conservation and development of
renewable resources is laudable.

Military spending, on the other
hand, exhibits a disturbing upward
trend—contrary to campaign prom-

'ises—and there is a frightening
emphasis on weapons research and
development. Production of be
mobile, land-based, MX missile, .ur
instance, can only complicate
present and future arms limitation
talks; yet Carter, who says he seeks
the elimination of all nuclear
weapons, has budgeted increased
funding for the MX.

Overall, the President has
proposed, as always, what he thinks
will be “in the best interests of the
American people. ” Unfortunately,
his budget is built around engines of
destruction, including an econo ic
philosophy that, as always, ten fro

forget America’s poor as wel is

God's good air, land and water. '

Adoming Dorms

By JOHN mcnnm"

What can be done with a
pie-shaped cell in the Towers or a
cube in the Quad? What can be
done to make the space liveable, a
home away from home?

These questions pop into the
head of the new dormitory student
as he stands in the doorway of his
naked room. The answer is easy:
plenty.

Students plagued with thoughts
of creating a decent atmosphere to
live in have discovered a number of
ways to turn their cold dorm rooms
into warm little nests—and the
University intervenes very little.

Students can do just about
anything to decorate within rea-
son,” said Jack Miller, mainten-
ance superintendent, “as long as

‘ they don’t destroy anything.”

One of the ﬁrst places to start is
decorating the room color. The
majority of dorm rooms are painted
in “University” white, yellow, blue
or orange. Not bad colors, but a bit
boring. However, should you walk
into your room the ﬁrst day to

' discover its former occupant left you

a chartreuse legacy with ﬁre-red
beams, you might opt to use one of
those University colors. Mainten-
ance will supply you with every-
thing you need to transform the
monstrosity into cream yellow or
sky blue.

Those who are turned off by the
University colors can supply their
own paint to create the desired
atmosphere. A popular custom in
the Towers is painting the room’s

ceiling beams brown and the walls
and ceiling another colorto create
the old European cottage effect.
Others paint ﬁgures such as
iconographic clouds on the ceiling
or arrows darting along the walls.

The ceiling is one room area open
to almost any decorating idea.
Mobiles can be hung; the ever-pop-
ular ﬁshnet, available in almost any
color, can be twisted in any shape
imaginable and strung across the
ceiling. Fishnet works well in the
Towers and Lothrop due to the small
size of the rooms, but is particularly
effective in making Quad rooms
homey because it lowers the high
ceilings.

The most striking piece of
furniture in any dorm room, due to
its size, is the bed. The bed is one of
the major factors of a well-balanced,
color-coordinated room. The
bedspread can match the color of
the walls; everything else (lamps,
candles, Kleenex boxes) can match
the bedspreads. Many students
make or buy drapes to match the
bedspreads.

The position of the bed can
enhance a room. In the Quad,
where all the furniture is movable,
roommates can rearrange the room
at their slightest whim. In the
Towers, the only furniture not
nailed down is the bed, so moving it
is the only way to rearrange the
room. There are two options for a
person living in a Towers double
(there, is no room to move a bed in a

single short of turning it on its side):
turning the beds parallel to the

‘Things That Go

By LARRY DANDREA

1..c‘+‘59{x011;.want..tp_Lt>_e .a, Carnegie
Institute night watchman, eh?”
He was tall and thin, with jet

. black hair and a skin color usually

associated with young boys who
have just tasted their first cigar.

When he spoke, the words rolled‘

off his tongue so slowly that they
seemed to drip.

There was no doubt about it; he
must have been an Air Force
recruiter for kamikaze pilots during
World War II. Otherwise, he had
missed his calling in life. ‘

“Well, your application seems to
be in order, but I still have to ask
you some questions, strictly routine
stuff.”

Wasting little time, he proceed-
ed to wade mechanically through a
seemingly inﬁnite list of nonsense.
After some time, he began to
smile. Striking a pose that would
have made Edgar Allen Poe
blanch, he said; “By the by, have
you ever held hands with a 3,000
year-old Egyptian Pharaoh at four
in the morning...during a full
moon?”

“Fortunately not,” I answered,
hoping this was simply some new
managerial method of testing an
applicant’s ability to handle a
foreign situation.

“Well then, how about this,” he

‘said. “Have you ever listened to

the asthmatic moans and groans of
an 80-year-old pipe organ as it
takes in air at 2 a.m., just as the
elevator answers the call button on

another floor, and you know you

 

are the only living thing in the
building?”

“You can’t be serious.” Either 

this was some type of prank, or this
guy had spent a great deal of his
time sleeping on his head. '

“Have you ever been pursued
through 11 ﬂoors of library, stacks
by a female ghost in a wedding
gown, your heart beating like a‘
jackhammer on your ribs when she
catches you,...in the dark?”~

“O.K., lO.K. What’s
punchline? ’ ’

“'10 the contrary, this is no
joke,” he said. Federal labor laws

door or making bunk beds. The
second option is by far the more
popular; many students build their
own bunk beds. The advantage of
bunk beds is obviously the extra
room they provide, since two beds
occupy the floor space of one. The

» extra room can be transformed into ,
a small living area, with wicker or-‘~

beanbag chairs and small tables.

Another great addition to any
dorm room is a rug. Some students
buy small throw rugs for various
places in the room, while others
invest in wall-to-wall carpeting,
either shag or pile, although shag
seems to be more popular.

Yet another common decorating
device in the dorms is plants. They
adorn shelves and desks and hang
from plant poles or in macrame
hangers from the walls or ceiling,
adding the touch of live greenery
that brightens any room.

One area of a Towers or Lothrop
room that has potential, but is rarely
worked with, is the entrance to the
larger part of the room from the
closet vestibule. Drapes can be
drawn across this opening and
gathered halfway down for a French
Provincial look; if you prefer the
harem effect, strings of beads can
be hung to the ﬂoor.

In rooms as small as the Towers,
what is done with a bulletin board
can make or break a room. This is
the area in which a resident can be
most creative. Bulletin boards are
covered with burlap, colored shelf
paper or printed contact paper,
and can be adorned with posters,

require us to warn...ask, that is,‘ , ._._\ ‘
these questions of all of our 

prospective night watchmen.
Looks like we'll have to put you
down as negative in terms of work
experience.”

Sensing that the odds of getting
hired were growing slimmer by the
minute, I came up with something
quickly. “But that’s not fair. What
about experience in everyday life,
like walking the streets of Oakland
alone after dark, without the
benefit of an automatic weapon?
Or like sitting through 12 consecu-
tive showings of “The Exorcist” at
the Strand Theater? Doesn’t all of
this count for something?”

“Mercy me, I’m afraid you’re
right,” he said. “We’ll have to
~make that positive on the question
ofprior history of mental illness.”

Does this mean there is no
chance of getting the job?” I said
on the verge of a complete
emotional breakdown.

“Why, not at all. Insanity is

common among our night security

people. If you will just sign this
standard release form, the job will
be yours. You can start tomorrow
at midnight, if you like.”

After one has received several
death threats from the University
computer in charge of student
accounts, a full-time job, even on
the 12-to-eight shift, looks like
manna-from heaven.

To say that my transition from a
normal, impoverished student to a
bleary-eyed watchman was difficult
would be an understatement.

Students are usually human, and
humans, unlike gerbils, aren’t
nocturnal by nature. However,
gerbils have a difficult time
walking seven miles a night while
carrying an eight-pound watch-

prints, photographs, original art-
-work and philisophical sayings.

Here, the resident can let himself

go.
Other styles of decorating do
exist in the dorms, and three are
very popular. The ﬁrst is the
Freshman look, obtained by varying
all your possessions to make them
different from your roommate’s—-
different bedspreads, different

clock. Thus, the need for a
student-watchman.

At any rate, after three weeks of
training with another employee, I
learned all of my duties, and the
squeak of Army-surplus shoes over
marble floors had become toler-
able. The time had arrived for the
inevitable solo test.

Leaving the security office alone
at midnight, for the ﬁrst time,
gives one a feeling not unlike that
of the sixth man in a game of
Russian roulette. One just knows
something is going to happen.

The ﬁrst six hours of the night
ran smoothly, without incident.
The only deviation from the norm
was a burned-out ﬂashlight, which
gave rise to great amusement
among the other watchmen.

“Dumb rookie, he should have
known to carry an extra bulb and
fresh batteries,” they sneered.
“He’ll learn.”

However, just as the calm before

‘the storm frightens the veteran

ﬁsherman, the quiet night stirs
apprehension in the security guard.

The inevitable was about to take
place.

As I passed beneath the ancient
bones of an overnourished bronto-
saurus, my newly trained watch-
man’s ears picked up the distinct
sounds of ﬂuttering wings.

In the beast’s pelvic region,
through a skeletal maze of
antiquity, my ﬂash1ight’s beam
locked onto its target. Despite a
frantic body search, I found the

lamps, and so on. The eye appeal is
not tremendous, but it provides the
variety so many students enjoy.

The second is the “I-aon’t-live- '
here-I-just-sleep-here” look, ac-
hieved by keeping the decorating to
a minimum. A bedspread, a lamp,
and a few books capture this mood
easily.

“Security office, do you read,
over?” I said. "J".

“This is security, Joe speaking,
what’s the problem?”

“Joe, this may sound hard to
believe, but there is a bat ﬂying
around up here in Dinosaur Hall.”

“Are you sure?”

“Of course I’m sure. It has long
black wings, sharp shiny little ,
teeth, and two furry black ears.”

“Sounds like it might be one of
the guys from daylight still hanging
around.”

“Are you nuts, or what? There
is a huge bat up here.”

“Check and see if it’s wearing a
green sports coat and black tie.”

“Will you please be serious,” I
said. 5 up

for a gourmet meal and decides to

“So what’s to worry?” he said.
“You’ll sleep like a baby all day
long and be wide awake at

common in all the dorms and
probably the easiest and most fun to
attain. To create this look, throw
your clothing anywhere after
removing it, and leave it where it

falls . When eating or drinking,
spill whatever you can on the ﬂoor,

bedspreads or desks, and leave

popcorn or other tidbits under the
bed to collect dustballs. Don’t wash
any glasses or dishes; let them
accumulate in various parts of the
room. Never make the bed and
whatever you do, don’t dust—-—this is
the crowning touch of the effect.

a Sha Na Na Warms Over Nost

’s..¢_'}

{.3



’7...z

By KEITH BRIAN

Pitt News Staff Writer

This past weekend, the Stanley
Theater took a giant step backwards
to the 19SO’s. The world’s oldest
teenagers performed three sellout
shows to audiences ranging from
teenagers to little old ladies.

Sha Na Na storms the stage to
sounds of their theme song (“Sha
na na”). The 10-man entourage
plays ﬁve instruments; piano, tenor
sax, drums, bass and lead guitar.
This, of course, leaves room for ﬁve
singer-dancers (for all the do-wops
and shang-a-langs), three of which
are clad in glittering gold tights.

They performed the familiar
ﬁfties songs that are being revived
and rehashed by “Happy Days”
and tributes to Elvis. Sha Na Na,
while limiting their music, put on
a precision performance.

The troup displayed the theatric
precursors of “modern” pop
performances with sarcastic ges-
tures of hands folded in prayer
during “Teen Angel,” a bubbling

piano during “Splish Splash I Was
Taking a Bath” and the shaking
bottom of an Elvis (Presley not
Costello) imitator during “All
Shook Up.”

A skit in the middle of the show
included street props (parking
meter, street lamp, etc.), a rumble
under strobe lights, and" a fog
machine that was a good lead into
“Smoke Gets In Your Eyes.”

After the smoke cleared, the next
skit started with “Sh-Boom.” More
action came in the form of the Sha
Na Na dance contest. Three lucky
ladies from the audience partici-
pated in a medley of jitterbug,
cha-cha, and twist.

The contest winner was awarded
a waltz with the one and only “Fat
Man,” Len Bankar the sax player,
under the mirror ball. “Hound
Dog” remembered Presley with a
new costume (leathers and guitar
studded with sequins) in the ﬁrst
encore. The show ended,
appropriately, with “Goodnight
Sweetheart.”

Pitt News Staff Writer
Attachments

By Judith Rossner

Judith Rossner’s fourth novel,
“Attachments,” follows on the
heels of the successful “Looking
for Mr. Goodbar,” lending an air of
expectation to the new work.
Though nicely written, “Attach-
ments” seems contrived and
sensationalized. It is easy to
picture a woman who haunts the
singles bars looking for the
ultimate ‘encounter, but Rossner’s
latest tale of a woman fascinated by

freaks is unrealistic.

Amos and Eddie Smith are
Siamese twins, attached by a
narrow band of ﬂesh at the
abdomen. Nadine and Dianne are
best friends, but their attachment
proves more binding than the
physical one of the twins they
marry.

Nadine tells the story of her
friendship with Dianne, which
becomes the central force in both
women's lives. They meet in the
early ﬁfties: Dianne is a child

prodigy, crippled by her psychia-
trist parents who have documented
her life; Nadine is alienated from
her parents—a former Miss Amer-
alcoholic

ica mother and an

Music Hall.

out that her‘ father, a swimming

  
 

father-who make no room for
their child in their closeness.
Nadine is obsessed with freaks,
feeling that they are normal
compared to her. Dianne, in turn,
is fascinated with Nadine’s obses-
sion, and the two become friends.

They become an inseparable

c As in “Goodbar,” Rossner does
not develop any characters beyond
the central one. “Attachments”
needs a fuller picture of Dianne to
understand the closeness between
her and Nadine.

Nadine is quickly recognizable as
a variation on “Goodbar’s”

childhoods devoid of parental

Nadine is probably the best

created, but Nadine cannot make
this book work by herself.

 Cagers Boxed By Dukes’ Defense, 88-66

By BOB LABRIOLA

Pin News Staff W_ri_ier
Pitt had its offense put in a box

and mailed back to Oakland
yesterday, as the Duquesne Dukes
embarrassed the Panthers, 88-66,
at the Civic Arena. 7

Duquesne employed a box-and-
one defense the entire time Larry
Harris was on the ﬂoor, forcing the
Panthers to shoot a pitiful 31
percent from the ﬁeld. Ron Dixon,
freshman guard from Macon, Ga.,
was given the assignment of
staying inside Harris’s uniform and
responded well in his first
collegiate start.

Harris was never a factor in the
game, as the 6-6 senior didn’t take
a shot until the first half was 10
minutes old, and didn’t get his ﬁrst
ﬁeld goal until three minutes later.
Harris barely broke into double
ﬁgures with 10 points on a
four-for-10 afternoon from the
ﬁeld, which caused the Dukes to
break into a raucous chorus of
“Who’s Larry Harris” in the
victors’ locker room.

Neither Pitt nor Harris had ever
seen a box-and-one defense before,
and coach Tim Grgurich admitted
that the Panthers had never
practiced for this type of defensive
strategy.

“We tried both our zone and our
man-to-man offense against the
box,” Grgurich said. “The secret
against that type of defense is to
get it early, and we didn’t do it.
We’ve never practiced against it,
but I felt that we had the shooters
to beat the defense if anyone ever
threw it up against us.”

For the ﬁrst time this year, Pitt
was beaten badly in the battle of

the boards, as Duquesne enjoyed a I

33-22 edge in rebounding. Sam
Clancy was the leading rebounder
in the game (what else is new), but
couldn’t offset the balanced board
strength displayed by the Dukes.

Is Duquesne really 22 points

better than Pitt? Is Pitt really a
one-man team that falls apart when
its star is turned to stardust? Did
Dukes coach John Cinicola and
Mike Rice outfox Pitt headman Tim
Grgurich? 7

If you spent your afternoon at the
Civic Arena yesterday you know the
answers to the above questions are

no, no and a great big yes. The
Dukes did clobber Pitt, 88-66, in a

Sports

Wayne Williams and Terry
Knight picked a poor time to have
an off-game in the shooting
department, as the box-and-one’
leaves many shot opportunities for
the other four players. The
Panthers’ backcourt duo could only
ﬁnd the mark on six of 23 attempts
from the ﬁeld, as Duquesne was
constantly building on a lead it
captured in the opening minutes.

Ed Scheuermann was taken out
of the game by the ofﬁciating crew,
picking up three personals in a
four-minute span early in the ﬁrst
half. Wayne Talbott, Pitt’s lone big
man coming off the bench, didn’t
have the necessary offensive
ﬁrepower to take advantage of
Duquesne’s defense.

Pete Strickland came off the
bench to pump in 11 points in 15
minutes of playing time, including
a stunning 35-foot jumper at the
ﬁrst-half buzzer.

Dave Olinger, inserted into the
game to take some of the pressure
off Harris, came out cold just like
everyone else, and Duquesne
found itself in total control of the
game as the result of the defensive
strategy.

V “Going into, the game, we felt we
had to keep Harris out of the
offense because he’s one of the
best pure shooters We’ve played
against,” Duquesne coach John
Cinicola said. “We created this
defense for Pitt, and all the credit
should go to Mike Rice
(Duquesne’s assistant coach).

“We chose Dixon for the job
because he is rangy, has long arms
and good quickness. We accom-
plished what we set out to do
defensively.”

game that wasn't as close as the
score would indicate, but only the
most blindly loyal Bluff fan could

say Duquesne is that much better.

Shooting the ball as if they were
hurling a grapefruit, the Panthers
shot only 31 percent from the ﬁeld,
and a tight Duquesne box-and-one
defense put the screws to Larry

Harris, holding the Panthers’.

leading scorer to a season-low 10
points.
The box-and-one defense, with

After trailing by eight points at
the half, Pitt was never able to get
any closer, and in the ﬁnal 13
minutes the Dukes built a lead that
Pitt couldn’t have overcome (the
way the Panthers were shooting) if
the two teams were still playing.

John Thomas, John Moore and
Richard Cotten all played well for
the Dukes, combining for 48 points
and 20 rebounds. Although the
entire Duquesne team played well,
the key men for the Dukes
yesterday were seated at the end of
the bench plotting strategy.

The ofﬁciating was, for the most
part, as poor as the weather outside
the Arena. Many times a foul was
called for a veritable love-tap, and
nothing was called when bodies
were litteriiig the court. It was
ﬁtting that the ofﬁciating was as
inconsistent as the Panthers’ play.

“The referees seemed more
worried about the coaches standing
up instead of what was going on in
the game,” Grgurich said. “When
you lose by 22 points though, it’s
not the ofﬁciating.”

B.B. Flenory showed some ill
affects still remain from the blows
on the head he received during the
season last year. With. the Dukes
protecting a 20-point lead, Flenory
decided it was time for a bit of
“showmanship’ ’ , choosing Clancy
as the brunt of his antics. Lest
Flenory forget, he is six foot-one
inch and 150 pounds, Clancy is six
foot-six inches, 220 pounds, and
has more basketball ability in his
used socks than B.B. has in his
bush little body.

“There was not one phase of the
game we played Well in compared
with Duquesne,” Grgurich added.
“Our whole ballclub just stood
around on offense all afternoon.”

They were probably waiting for
the mail.

Duquesne freshman Ron Dixon
being the nail in Harris’s box, left
the other four Pitt players
wondering what to do. Grgurich
admitted after the game the
Panthers hadn’t practiced against
the box-and-one, so chalk one up for
Cinicola and Rice.

“I really feel we shoot the ball
well enough so that if someone
plays a box-and-one against us, we
can handle it,” Grgurich said. “I
don’t think we shot well-enough

Surprising Gymnasts Bow

‘ By SUE McFARLAND

Pitt News Staff Writer

When is a defeat not really a
defeat? The answer was etched in
the faces of coach Donna DeMarino
and her 16th-ranked women’s
gymanstics team, as it smashed
virtually every school record before
losing to defending national cham-
pion Clarion State, 145.15-140.45.

‘ ‘I was totally surprised tonight,”
DeMarino said after the Friday day
evening meet before a capacity
crowd at Trees Hall. ‘ ‘I knew we had
the potential to reach 140 points, but
I thought it would take until the end
of the season. This was just totally
beyond anything I ever expected.”

Before the meet, DeMarino set
the team scoring goal for the meet at
136, not knowing her young
gymnasts were destined to break
the overall scoring record of 135.45,
set early last month against Penn
State.

The Pantherettes did not stop at

breaking the team scoring record.

Instead, under the direction of
freshman dynamic duo Myra
Bachuchin and Bonnie Tressler,
they went on to break every
individual record, save the balance
beam mark of 9.3 (set only last week
against Slippery Rock) with a 9.45,
good enough to take first place
honors. She also replaced a ﬂoor
exercise record of 9.15 previously
held by Tressler, with a score of 9.3.

Tressler contributed her talents
to the record-breaking evening by
eliminating Bachuchin’s standing
record of 9.15 on the uneven bars
with her mark of 9.2.

Bachuchin and Tressler teamed
up to deliver two ﬁrst—place
ﬁnishes, two seconds and an equal
number of third-place showings.
Bachuchin’s first-place ﬁnish on
the vault and third on the unevens
paved the way for her second-place
honors in all-around competition.
Tressler took second on the unevens
and third in the all-around.

“I never expected to see each of

our girls hit every routine so well,”
DeMarino said. “We expected
high scores, but everyone was
hitting tonight.

‘ ‘They’re young, but tonight they

looked like a team of juniors and '

seniors. Tonight, I just didn’t feel
as though we lost.”

The Pantherettes improved their
January ranking of 20th in the
nation jumping to 16th for the month
of February, according to a poll of
gymnastics coaches across Amer-
ica.

“Our 16th ranking is going to
improve; it should go up as a result
of this meet,” DeMarino said,
“Right now there are only six teams
that have scored 140, or more points,
I just hope we can repeat this
performance for regionals. ’ ’

The Pantherettes hope to conti-
nue their record-breaking ways, as
they take to the road for a meet with
Kent State this Friday, then return
to their home ﬂoor Feb. 21 for a
tri-meet with Indiana and Youngs-
town State. ’

Duquesne Answers Questions With Convincing Victory

Every team has its bad days, but
the sign of a good team, a
tournament team, is its ability to
ﬁght back and stuff the past in a

today. You can’t shoot 31 or 32
percent and win basketball
games.”

No, you can’t, as 9,916 attendees
discovered. But that wasn't all Pitt
managed to do wrong. Its shot
selection was awful, Duquesne

totally dominated both the offensive —

and defensive backboards, and the
28 points the Panthers picked up in
the second half wouldn’t have been
enough to beat a pack of traveling
nuns.

Where were the rest of the
Panthers on a day when Harris
might have been better off listening
to the game on the radio? Wayne
Williams played well in the ﬁrst
half, scoring all of his 10 points, but
Terry Knight did the reverse,
picking up eight of his nine points in
the second half.

Ed Scheuermann drew three
personal fouls early in the game and
sat down for most of the day,
leaving Sam Clancy all the work
inside. Even Clancy can only do so
much, and he can do even less when
he has to do it all himself. The six
foot-six inch strongman played
admirably on a generally frustrating
afternoon, leading the Panthers
with 16 points while grabbing 10
rebounds.

Pete Strickland re-emerged from
his six- game exile on the bench and
pumped home 11 points, including a

buzzer-beating 35-footer at the end

of the ﬁrst half.

Grgurich’s job now, and a tough
one it will be, is to lift his Panthers
back up in time for Wednesday’s
encounter with West Virginia in
Morgantown.

closet. The battle with the
Mountaineers could set the tone for
what remains of the Panthers’

“ ‘season .

But no matter what happens, Pitt

gets another shot at Duquesne, this ‘

time at the Field House on Feb.22.
They might not win, but, on a
somewhat bright note, they won't
shoot any worse than they did
yesterday.

Two notes in passing: Du
quesne’s ball-handling sophomore
B.B. Flenory pulled the dumbest
stunt since the’ Japanese attacked
Pearl Harbor. While dribbling
away to try to run out the clock,
Flenory knelt and dribbled taunt-
ingly in front of Clancy. Flenory,
whose initials obviously stand for
Bush Ballplayer, should be remind-
ed of three things: He must face
Clancy and Pitt at least seven more
times in his college career, Clancy
has eaten steaks for dinner larger,
and smarter, than the six foot-one
inch Flenory, and ballplayers don’t
forget those kind of insults.

Secondly, the Bad Taste Trophy
for I978 was retired yesterday by
Duquesne’s Sports Information
Department. On the game program
they issued came the revelation that
when Pitt and Duquesne match up
for a basketball game, it can be
compared to a meeting between the
“Israelis and the Arabs.”What
does that make the Pitt and Penn
State rivalrv like, South Moluccan
terrorists and Dutch school children
on a bus? Good work, guys.

Pantherettes Place Sixth in Invite e 

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pit‘ News Staff Writer

Pitt failed to win an event
Saturday, but still placed sixth in a
ﬁeld of ~18 teams at the second
annual Pitt Women’s Indoor
Invitational at the Field House.

A powerful Michigan State squad
took top team honors, scoring a total
of 70 2/3 points, marking the second
straight year the Spartanettes have
won the Invitational.

Maryland had the most wins
(ﬁve), but was nudged out for top
team honors by MSU, which won
only one, but placed in the top four
in nine of the 13 events.

Highlighting the meet for the
Pantherettes was the high jump
competition, in which Marie Ribik
and Karen Krichko placed second
and fourth, respectively. Ribik’s
jump of 5 feet, six inches wasn't
enough to beat Paula Girven

(Maryland), who jumped 5-8, tying
her own Field House and Invita-
tional records set last year.

A personal triumph was gained
by Carmen Scherich, who made the
ﬁnals in the shot put with her best
throw ever, 37 feet, 4 inches.
Delaware State’s Sharon Redvict
won the event while setting new
Field House and Invitational
records, 44 feet 5 inches.

There was little good news in the
running events for Pitt, as no one
placed higher than a tie for third
place. Gwen Murray did that in the
220 with a time of 25.6, equaling the
old Field House and Invitational
records, but it wasn’t good enough
as Marshall Davis of Maryland
broke that record with a time of 25.4
seconds.

Another Pantherette placing in
the top six was Leslie Palmer who
took fourth place in the 50-yard

Michigan State, Ohio State and
winner Maryland (1:43.9). The mile
relay team placed ﬁfth with a time of
4:12, behind Ohio State, Temple,
Maryland and the record-breaking
combination of Paula and Paulette
Clagon, Tanya Bryant and Yvette
Boleman of Morgan State (3:50.3).

Other event winners included
Myrtle Choice (Maryland) in the
long jump, Pam Sedwick (Michigan
State) in the 880 and Debbie Paulik

Pitt head coach Alfreeda Goff was
very pleased with the meet and
said, “I think the Invitational was a
big success and the competition was

excellent for the girls. As a team,

the girls performed a lot better than
we expected and this meet gives us

_ something to build on.”

Show No Pity,
Top W, 74-39

By ANGELA VAVITHES
Pill News Staff Writer

The Pitt swimming team pulled
off a big win against West Virginia
University Saturday, topping the
Mountaineers by 74-39.

“You could feel the intensity of
the meet,” backstroker Stuart .
Swanson said of the meeting .
between the two rivals. “We tried
to run up the score; there was no
pity shown.”

The 50-yard freestyle was an
example of the prevailing spirit. ‘
When Pitt freshman Mickey
Termin stepped up to the block
after bowing out of the 200-yard
freestyle, he was subjected to jeers
from the Mountaineers. Termin
still managed to take ﬁrst in the
event while Civis, also from Pitt,
took second.

Stuart Swanson set a new pool’ '
record winning the 200-yard .

backstroke in 1:57.4. Scott Winkler
had an excellent day, taking ﬁrsts
in both the one-and three-meter
diving competition.

Pitt’s relays were undefeated for
the meet. The medley relay of
Swanson, Mike Connor, Mark
Schuman and Tom McGinley took
ﬁrst in 3:34.0 while Civis, Bob
Greenwald, Neal Wallace and
McGinley led the freestyle relay to
victory.

Other notable performances were
Jeff Trew’s victories

and the one-two punch of Civis and
Schuman in the 100-yard freestyle.

The Panthers will be faced with
two meets next week: Clarion State
Friday and Cleveland State
Saturday.

Grapplers Lock Up Eagies    

ByCHIPHUBBARD

To the Pitt wrestling team, there
is something special about the
ﬁgures 6-3, 7-3 and 13-4, 13-5.

The ﬁrst set of ﬁgures represent
the grapplers’ record before and
after Saturday’s Lock Haven meet.
Knowing this, the second set of

part of the mat in the 126-pound
match, defeating Adems, 6-1.

Pitt also won the 190-pound
confrontation as Bill Bailey wrest-
led for the second time this year.
Bailey decisioned Tim Thompson
and in the heavyweight match,

Mark Stepanovich beat Gregg
Koontz. _ Q

Besides losing the 177-pound
class, the Panthers dropped the
158-and 142-pound meets. It was
at 142 that Lock Haven scored its
fall of the night, with Mike Moore
beating Pitt’s Kim Smith.

McCaffrey, wrestling in the

lost to Austin Shanfelter 4-3. His
performance not only brought
enthusiastic cheers from the crowd
but also drew praise from Adams
and fellow teammates.

“I was extremly impressed by
the way McCaffrey wrestled,” said
Adams. “He typiﬁes this team
right now; he’s going to battle for

“He went out and wrestled the
best match he could wrestle,”
Adams continued. “He really
