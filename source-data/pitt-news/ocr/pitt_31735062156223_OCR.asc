A Pass and Honors Majorslnow going into effect here, has
gcireated some confusion in the minds of "Pitt students. The
coming of Phi Beta Kappa has complicated the scene and
"added to that confusion, especially forstudents eligible for

both. _
‘ 2 Very little has been said about
the requirements for Phi Beta
Kappa and next week many stu-
dents will havetheir semester con-
ferences with. advisors. Perhaps a
roundup of available facts will
prove helpful togthem in» planning
schedules.

Under the new policy, which ap-
plies to students - beginning _ their
senior work in the fall of 1953 as
well as incoming freshmen, Hon-
ors majors are ,disti_nguishe_d from
Pass Majors. Byithge end of the
,third serneste1‘,_ each student
should select a‘ ﬁeld of concentra-
tion in which to do his majo
work. '

This ﬁeld consists of a major of
about 24 credits ‘plus related sub-_

the sophomore ‘year, the student
then applies for admission as
either a Pass or Honor Major;

_A'Pass Major must» earn at least
36 credits in his major and relat-

As understood now, 16 may be in
related subjects and only 20 or
so in amajor subject.

_ ¢tendency for a strong sports pro-

gram is meeting with disapproval.

A campus poll on the question
“Do you think Pitt’s efforts to
build up its inter-collegiate ath-
letic‘ program is a healthy or an
unhealthy trend” showed:

Don ‘Marshall, electrical engi-
neering, ’53—“I’m in favor of it.
Sports give a student a spirit of
belonging to a school and make it
more like a school than a fac-
tory.” ' s

Eileen Paler, college, ’55—“The
student body doesn’t support its
sports teams and too much em-
phasis is already put on "non-
school activities.” , ' ’

Connie Hoover, college, ’55—-
-“Sports are a colorful part of stu-

dent life and should be empha-

sized, but not to the point that
they are all the school stands for.”
Thom Gemmell, college, f56-—
“Spoits tend to draw the students
closer to the University. We should
have a stronger and more varied
sports program.” "
Kitty Maddox, college, ’56—“A
good. sports program gives students
an interest in their school, but it
shouldn’t overshadow the academic
side of school.” '

D o 1. Bromby, college, ,’55——
“Through. ‘Pitt building up its ath-
letic program it will gain national
prestige and thereby cause a
greater interest in University ac-
tivities.” _ ‘ \

Ed Fatula, law—“The_ tendency
toward professionalism‘ detracts
from the-school’s main function of
educati__on.”. _ A

JoAn'n Shenkel, education, ’5_3—
“If it gave. us this'year’s football
teaVm-‘--‘'it_’s,_good.,’’ -  -_ -W .

 -r ‘  ,1 - '

    

more_ school spirit and unite the
studenthbody.” — ' '
W. H. Smith, 1aw—“Good-—gmore
emphasis on football would get
ﬁnancial support for other sports.”
' Joe Banik, pre-med, ’56'—“It
gives the school .more recognition.
Also other sports in the University
should: be developed.” - ‘

David Abbatangelo, ' law-—-“If
we’re going to play a big—time
schedule, we need a ﬁrst class. foot-
ball team. If not I would recom-
mend de—emphasis to_the Carnegie
Tech scale. There. is no in-be-
tween.” , . _ 4

‘Chris’ 'Fourgis, college, ’53—“A
very good trend. It might stimug
late students who want to go to
college to pick a school with a
reputable football team.” V ‘

Pauline Markess, business edu-
cation, ’56—“More students could
participate in sports if the athletic
program were enlarged.

  
   
  
  
 
  
   
  
   
   
    
  
  
   
   
    
   
   
 
 
  
   
 
    
  
  
  
  
   
    
 
 
   
    
    
   
    
  
  

MC Studies 
Pre- 1941  
Point Scale

A proposal to establish a
point system for men’s activi- ‘_
ties was introduced during a._'"
meeting of the executive.com- 
mittee of ' Men’s Council,
Tuesday, Dec. 2. 

According to "the system. 
under consideration, each ac-
tivity will qualify for points de-
pending on the,activity’s sizeiand
prominence, and each student who 3
belongs to one or more activity, _'
will hold‘ points depending on’ his " _
position in the organization. l_

Previous to 1941, a point sys- 7-
tem for men had existed, but the ’:
system was discontinued at the
beginning of the war.
= Convention Idea

Morton Goldstein, vice president
of MC, conceived the idea during‘
a Phi Eta Sigma convention at
Purdue University wehere similar’ .
point arrangement is now work- -
mg. ‘ .

MC President Ron Ecker men-
tioned the' proposal Tuesday in .
his usual president’s report to MC, ’
but no action was taken. .

Ecker contacted Theodore W.
Biddle, dean of men, and reports
that Dean Biddle is in agreement -
with the plan. ‘ s

Go1dstein’s reason for proposing a '
the plan was that he feels the 
idea behind student‘ activities is
to provide richer experience "for
as many people as possible and
not merely to those students who j
can do them most efﬁciently. ’ ’

Lippert Asked Council " ,

During the regular meeting ‘of .-
Men’s Council, Lud Lippert, presi- .
dent of Men’s Debate, asked Coun- 
cil to give $20 to Men’s Debateso ‘
that entertainment for visiting" I
debaters from other universities
and colleges could be provided "
when they participate in a debate
here tomorrow. -

Lippert told Council that the
policy ‘of donating money to this _.
“worthy cause” has been. a policy
of MC for the past three years.
Melvin Forst, MC treasurer, felt
it would be“‘terrible‘ to; dispel an
old MC custom” and the money ,
was given.

i What ‘are the impressions of a person coming fromia‘
 small ‘private school to a large urban university such as
* Pitt? Miss‘ ‘Martha E. Jones, assistant dean of women, who

this year,‘ is well qualiﬁed to

,’ answer that question. ,
Miss Jones was graduated from
-' Denison University, a campus
‘ '-school in Granville,‘ Ohio and re
A _ceived.,her' MA degree from Duke,
hardly small, but also a campus
-university. Until‘ she came to Pitt,
she was an assistant dean at Penn-
sylvania College for Women,
I which is considered a private
“ school. A . 7

Emotional Maturity Greater
The young, blond and attractive
assistant dean feels that the emo-
tional maturity of Pitt students
is greater than that of students in
A a smallschool. She explained that
the reason for this is “the ma-
jority of students attending an ur-
_: bangschool live a life after classes
‘ apart from school life. They go
_ghome' or to a part-time job and
. there face new problerns and must
‘necessarily learn how to -solve
them.” _ ‘ ' l
_ “Here-at Pitt,” she said, “you
. learn to look out at the world in-
. stead of standing outside and look-
y ing-in-A at it. The world can’t pass
— you by if you are right in the
middle of it.” ‘ '

Aside from these more or less
 psychological observations, she
has‘--also noticed some of Pitt’s
physical attributes. F o r e m o s t
;.; -amongthese, she feels, are the Na-

‘tionality Rooms and the Com-
 mons Room.

-‘Yes’ To School Spirit
Here Miss Jones has‘_a reply for
all ‘those who say’ Pitt has no
gfschool spirit. She feels that schbol
.-spirit is not all cheering and hand
clapping, but is shown in the stu-
.d.ents ‘respect for the Nationality
.4. Rooms and the Commons Room.

- “The really excellent condition
 these parts of the Cathedral are in
' despite so much use is no less
than amazing and shows that Pitt
'-students are truly proud of their
-school,” she remarked. _

She enjoys seeing the. students
w,ait‘for elevators, catching a bite
to eat between classes or a casual

  
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
    
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
    
  
  
   
  
   
 
  
   
  
   
  
 
  
 
  
   
  
  
  
    
   
   
  
   
   
  
 

took up that post August 1. or;

color and charm.” _ _
However Miss Jones’ entire life
is not one of leisuerly, observations.
Her days. are hectic since her du-
ties are many. Housing and Place-
ment for Women are her main

"tasks but she also serves as an ad-

visor on the Vocational Informa-
tion Committee. Part of her job,
too, is a weekly conference with
two groups of freshman women

in which the fresh exchange ideas
and try to solve any problemsithat
may arise. Besides these time con-
suming jobs she is connected with
WSGA, Women’s “political” group
on ‘campus. ~

for the clothing was so desperate,
that transportation authorities sent
the shipments free of freight.

A letter from a member of the
YWCA at Pusan told of a group
of ragged, barefoot youngsters who
were seen huddling together out-
side the building. They were
brought in, and given shoes which
were -collected during last year’s
drive. The shoes were oversize and
ill-ﬁtting, but they kept their feet
warm. ,

-Because of that letter, emphasis
in the January drive will be plac-
ed on collecting children’s warm
clothing and s h o e s , although
adults’ clothing is also being col-
lected.

Donors are asked to bring all
usable clothing to the Y» WCA of-
ﬁce on the twelfth ﬂoor. Con-
tributions will be accepted dur-
ing the entire month of December
and the ﬁrst week of January.

It7s surprising, considering last -

that the sena-» -

But ‘ while we’re still able to

counter the senator’s charges.
He has evidently seen what he
takes to be an unhealthy tenden-
cy in the direction of Commun-

in an im‘:er.i‘or position to men.

Soon-,,however, these anti Women Haters shift- ,
ed their attack. The. emphasis changed_from‘mor-
alityto practicality. The result of women working

long hours, they illustrated, was
lower Wages for men.

Since the 18th century, when
they were but Chicago Tribune’s,

dous strides. But much remain

seeing and wise people, would have taken "the
lead in advancing Woman’s cause. But‘ such has‘
-not been the case. s

Latest Example" ‘ .

The latest example of how the colleges are let-
ting the girls down has come to our attention
through the’ courtesy. of the Amateur Athletic Union
in New York. The Athletic Union, through spokes-
man Daniel .J. Ferris, charges. that ‘the colleges,
because of their neglectrof the fairer sex, are let-
ting not only-women but the country down.

_.There' is not, as far as .-any- _

one knows,ca single openly pro-

There is, however, a good deal

it, just as there is a lot of inter-

But it does not follow that
since there is a‘ lively interest in
Communism in the schools that
they". are “nests of Communism”
"that need weeding ‘out, any more

than they are nests of sociology, .

which is a ‘healthy sign, because’

i Ferris explains that the United States almost __

Reds’ superiority in the women’s events. '

To insure victoryin the ’56 Olympics, we must,
Ferris argues, build up our strength in women’s,
track and ﬁeld events.

‘.‘It’s alshame,” Ferris said, “that America doesn’t

‘give her girls more of a chance to be great.”

Many girls,’ of course, have shied away from
athletics because they fear a’ loss of feminity.
Ferris answers, “Participation in track and field,

"Greatest. Danger , _   .

- The greatest danger to an enlarged ‘sports ‘pro’,-

the University could concentrate on improving the A

Scenery Must
Be Tops F or
Players Effort

By BARBARA SCHWARTZ

Major requirementof scene-
ry for the Pitt Player’s pro-
duction “The Heiress” is that

"it be a thing of beauty, ac-

cording to Robert Prendeville,
in charge of sets for the play.

Scenery in the play is not
Victorian, but only verges on
it, Prendeville said. It is more
classical and European than it is
Victorian.- Several elements take
precedence over period, he went
on.

The boy who comes to live in
the house comments upon its beau-
ty, he wishes to marry the girl in
it and make it his home. The doc-
tor is ‘a man of rich tastes and,
reﬂecting his tastes, wants his
house to‘ display the massiveness

of European style.‘ All these
things become more important
tha the actual period of the play,
which is approximately 1850.
Stairway Important

A stairway which is important
in the closing moments of the play
is called for. Much design and
work has gone into the construc-
tion of this stairway, Prendeville
said.

In the Broadway production of
“The Heiress” the stairway used

WHAT IS IT?—A hard worker
on a set crew studies his handi-
work while the admiring female
looks on. Scenery for “The
Heiress” plays an important role
in that it sets the mood for the
play. Much credit goes to the
many students who worked over
the Thanksgiving vacation and

in the evenings to ﬁnish work

on the scenery. The last Pitt
Playe1"s productio'.a was over
only four weeks ago and crews
had little time in which to do a.
lot of work. The psyc‘:.olo3'i?al

was partially hidden from the
View of the audience; the stairway
built by Prayers’ crews is in full
View of the onlookers. It starts in
the archway in the back of the
room and sweeps up toward the
audience twelve steps high.

Prendeville stated that tribute
for the sets should be made to a
lot of people who worked hard
and did much in a short period of
time. Last Player/‘s production was
ended only four weeks ago. Crews
worked over Thanksgiving holi-
days and many nights to have the
scenes ready for opening night

Veteran Lineup Faces

Big Ten Foe Tomorrow

By RUSS »FRANKE
Dr. H. C. Carlson starts on his second 30 years of coach-

ing at Pitt as he escorts his Panther cagers by plane to Ann’

Arbor to open the 1952-53 season against Michigan tomor-

row night.

Although the Wolverines will be trying out a new sys-
tem under a new coach, the change does not make Carlson’s
job of winning the" ﬁrst one any easier. Any Big Ten team

is naturally tough. .

And, like the Panthers, the host
squad is loaded with veterans, los-
ing only two regulars since ap-
pearing in last year’s Steel Bowl
at the Field House.

Wolverines Fast Break

Coach Bill Perigo, formerly of
W e s t e r n Michigan, completely
overhauled the Michigan attack
this year, installing the fast break
in place of Ernie McCoy’s slow,
control game, and thumped Mar-
quette, 80-70, in the ﬁrst test of
the season.

“I like the fast break,” he ex-
plained. “You get more shots and
it stands to reason you’ll score
more points.”

All of which should indicate a
busy night for both squads, since
Car1son’s style, in its defrosted
state, accents the fast break with
sharp passing and little dribbling.

Series Tied, 3-3

The youth-conscious Perigo also
revamped the Wolverine lineup,
chucking Capt. Doug Lawrence,
two-year veteran at guard, and
Center Leo Schlicht in favor of
newcomers Paul Groﬁsky and Ray
Pavichevich _ °‘ '

Rounding out the starters, Milt
1‘vIead, 6-7, and John Codwell play
the forwards, with standout Don
Eaddy at guard.

Michigan came out on top in the

last meeting between the two.

schools in 1948, 62-44, to tie the
series at three wins each—a series
which started in 1925. ‘

_ “Win ’Em All” _

Winning the rubber match would
be the ﬁrst installment in Carl-
son's plan to “win ’em all” again
this season.

At least the Panthers have ex-
perience in their fa «or, having lost
only John Kendrick, last year's
captain, through graduation.

Tomorr0w’s lineup will proba-
bly show Captain Mickey Zernich
and Dutch Burch at forward, Don
Virostek at center, and Art Boyd
and either Chet Palesko or Bill
Ruschel at guard.

Carlson seems pleased with re-
sults so far, relating how his boys
have found they can apply in
actual play what they have been
taught in drills.

Yesterday afternoon was spent .

in putting on an exhibition for
Life Magazine at the Field House,
centering chiefly around the use of
oxygen in revitalizing fatigued
players.

Photographers snapped count-
less pictures of the project, which
will probably appear in one of this
month’s issues.

Free Throw Line
Traffc Heavy

By BORIS ‘WEINSTEIN
Sports Editor ‘

Foul shooting- —an art that Pitt hoopsters didn’t take with

them when they left. ‘the Stadium pavilion for the spacious
Field’ House last ,year——will play even a more important
role in collegiate "basketball this season. A

Dr. H. C. Carlson, a spender of valuable hours on graphs
and charts, besides his regular ﬂoor tutoring, informs that
the guy standing on trial at the foul line will carry more

weight with each shot than ever
before. .

“In fact, it was as .

 

minutes all fouls will be worth two shots.”

Nowtif Doc, a perfectionist to the ﬁrst degree, can explain the
facts of life, in this respect, -to his proteges it may give birth to a-

few more victories this winter.

Last year, for example, the cagers outdid their foes in every
department but two; The ﬁrst was foul shooting. Pitt dumped
only‘ 328 shots of 556 attempts while the opposition hit on 381
of 582 throws. At least ﬁve games could have been won instead
of lost if the Panthers were more accurate at the foul line.
