Sexual
assault
discussed
at forum

By Kevin Kramer
Staff Writer

Pitt’s student groups put
aside their separate agendas
yesterday to join for a com-
mon cause — to discuss sex-
ual assault on campus.

At the President’s Council,
which is a forum for all gov-
ernance group presidents to

   
 

SGB

discuss their concerns on
campus, Sexual Assault
Services Coordinator Mary
Koch Ruiz discussed the
services her office provides.

“She focuses on counsel-
ing and advocacy,” said
Student Government Board
President Pro-Tempore
Elizabeth Mania, who dis-
cussed the President’s
Council at last night’s SGB
meeting. “She would take
students to the hospital, and
do a lot of things for the vic-
tim.” ’

Mania also mentioned that
Sexual Assault Services
offer educational programs
as well. “They have peer
educators that can go to any
campus 1 organization,”
Mania said.

Thesday, Novemberl, 1994

Pitt is lobbying to have the Tuition
Challenge Grant Program removed from
the 1996 Governor’s Budget because it
feels the program distributes funds
unequally to the institutions involved.

The original intent of the program was
to keep tuition for full-time Pennsylvania
students reasonable. It does this by link-
ing appropriations to a 4.5 percent tuition
increase cap, according to Kevin Evanto
of Pitt’s commonwealth relations office.

When first proposed in Fiscal Year
1990, the Challenge Grant funds were
allocated as a percent of the educational
and general line items of the budget.

Pitt against tuition challenge program

directly linked to an institution’s total
increase. The funds were in addition to
the increase in the general and education
line appropriation.

In FY 1991 however, funds were dis-
tributed on the basis of full-time under-
graduate resident enrollment. Institutions
with larger undergraduate populations
received significantly larger percentages
in their appropriations, according to
Evanto.

Penn State University received a 5.1
percent increase from the Challenge
Grant, giving them a total increase of 9.6
percent. Comparatively, Pitt and Temple
University received 7.4 percent and 7.0
percent respectively.

The Challenge Grant Program was dis-
continued in FY 1992 and 1993. It was

External studies offers new choices

By Fred Bigelow
For The Pitt News

“The University External
Studies Program allows people
access to classes they might not
otherwise have,” according to
Pitt senior Steve Heck.

Heck said he supplements
night classes with External
Studies classes because he is
too busy.

“I work full-time. I’m a hus-
band, father and touring bass
fisherman. It’s tough to fit
everything in,” Heck said.

Heck is just the kind of adult
student External Studies is try-
ing to reach, according to
Sandra Haber, assistant director

I for operations at UESP.

“UESP began in 1972 as an
outreach program for College
of General Studies students
who because of work, family or
distance, couldn’t come to regu-
larly scheduled classes,” said
Haber.

Haber said that of the 3,574
registrations the program
processed for the 93-94 acade-
mic year, about 30 percent were
from outside CGS.

“We are very committed to
serving the adult learner. We
feel that that’s. our mission,”
said Haber. “We spend a lot of
time communicating with our
students by phone and mail,
because they aren’t on campus.
We try not to use the adult
leamer’s time frivolously.”

“UESP is a semi-independent
distanced learning program
where students learn at their
own pace,” said Haber.

Haber said most UESP class-
es have three three-hour
Saturday workshops which
enhance the learning process.

“Workshops don’t really
replace lectures because the
class is self—paced,” said Haber.

“External studies is not an
easy way out. It is too easy to
procrastinate,” Haber quickly
added.

Tameika Bozeman, who said
she is taking four UESP classes
this tenn, agreed.

“I think you have to be really
disciplined to make it work. If

Options
for the
midterm
failure

By Jennifer McGinnis
Staff Writer

Failing a mid—term can add
a lot of unneeded stress to a
student’s life.

But, if you have failed a
mid-term, there are options
available aside from worry-
ing over it incessantly.

There are two basic
approaches that a student
who is failing a class can
take. Students can withdraw
from a class and concentrate
efforts on other courses, or
they can keep trying and
stick it out for the semester.

“If students are worried,
definitely now is the time to
talk to the teacher or teach-
ing assistant about how
they’re doing,” said Fred
Koloc, director of the
College of Arts and Sciences
advising office.

Koloc said students should
evaluate their situations and
ask their professors what
their chances of improving
are and ask for suggestions
that could make studying
easier.

The deadline to withdraw
from a class is Nov. 4, so
students have three weeks in
which they could catch up
on work and “rededicate

their efforts” if they would _

like to stay in the class,
Koloc said.

Koloc advised students to
take into consideration the
amount of time it will take
to catch up on their work in

you need someone looking
over your shoulder, this is not
the place for you,” Bozeman
said.

Haber explained that three
majors are available through
External Studies: history, eco-
nomics and psychology.

“That means that every
requirement for those majors
can be fulfilled exclusively
through UESP,” said Haber.

“If a student is not interested
in these three majors, they can
usually earn about 90 of their
120 credits through UESP.
They would have to take the
remaining credits through regu-
larly scheduled classes,” said
Haber. '

Fiore Pugliano, a lecturer and
academic advisor who has been
teaching Written Professional
Communication through the
program for 15 years, said, “I
really enjoy teaching it. Many
students are already working,
so they often have more experi-
ence to draw on and have more
clearly defined goals.”

Arthur Erbe, a lecturer in
English, also spoke highly of
External Studies students.

“Anyone who comes to a
three—hour Saturday class is
probably highly motivated and
capable of structuring their
time independently,” said Erbe.

“My main positive feeling
[about UESP] is that I’m reach-
ing someone who is not able to
be part of the main scheduling
process, so I’m meeting people

I wouldn’t otherwise meet,” F

Erbe added.

the class they are failing and whether
or not their other courses will suffer if
they spend extra time on the problem
course. -

Koloc said students should check
with their advisor before withdrawing
from a class to be certain they do not
need it to fulfill a general education
requirement or to complete their major.

One important concern of students
who wish to withdraw from a class is
whether or not they will lose their
financial aid, Koloc said. Withdrawing
from a course does not make a student
part-time. When you drop a class, you
are removed from the roster and are no
longer in the class, but withdrawing
from the class keeps you registered in
the class.

“You are still on the roster and get a
grade of W. You are in effect still reg-
istered for the course,” Koloc
explained.

Because financial aid is issued for
the entire year, a student cannot have
their aid revoked for withdrawing from
classes, said Koloc.

Students with aid will need to visit
the Financial Aid Office to check on
how many credits they will need to
pick up the next semester to have their
financial aid renewed for the following
year, according to Koloc.

Though students who withdraw from
classes run the risk of not having finan-
cial aid renewed for the next year,
Koloc said, “If you fail you’ll end up
in the same boat, and you certainly
wouldn’t have the QPA difficulty [if
you withdraw].”

Koloc also said a W looks better on a
record than a D or an F. “Most employ-
ers and graduate schools don’t mind
seeing a few W’s scattered here and
there,” Koloc said.

It is only when they see a consistent
pattern of W’s without any explanation
that they will ask a few questions, he
said.

If a student would want to just scrape
by with a D to get the class out of the
way, Koloc said to remember, “You
don’t have to protect your record from
every class you’re afraid of getting a D
in.’’

Pitt offers sources of help to students
who remain in problem courses. The
Learning Skills Center, located in 311
William Pitt Union, offers study skills
workshops, speed reading workshops,
individual appointments and math
tutoring to students.

Phi Eta Sigma honor fraternity
offers tutoring in classes ranging from
Classical Mythology and Literature to
Business Calculus. Students can find a
listing of all the classes Phi Eta Sigma
tutors on its office door in 516 WPU.

Students can call or stop by the
office to set up a tutoring appointment,
and sometimes tutoring can be
arranged for classes that are not on the
list of tutored subjects.

Students can receive feedback and
suggestions on papers and writing
assignments at the University Writing
Center in Room 501 Cathedral of
Learning.

A 30-minute tutoring session will
help students revise what they have
already written or generate ideas and
get the writing process started.

revived in FY 1994 with some changes.
Its allocations were now linked to an
institution’s total increase, rather than as
bonus funds.

The program also included full-time
graduate and professional students. This
still created an inequitable distribution of
funds. Penn State received a 4.9 percent
increase, Pitt a 3.5 percent increase,
Temple a 2.7 percent increase and Lincoln
University a 1.5 percent increase. The
program remained unchanged in FY 1995,
continuing the disparate distribution of
funds.

While this method of distribution may
at first seem fair, Evanto said, Pitt argues
that it is not. The program is ‘also a break
from the traditional practice of awarding
an equal percentage increase to all state-
related universities’ educational and gen-
eral funding.

Evanto said Pitt’s primary arguments in
opposition to the program were that it
does not take into account the diversity of
the student bodies of the institutions, it is
a restraint to growth and the funds are not
distributed in an equal manner.

The Joint State Government
Commission's February 1994 report,
“Institutional Output and Faculty Salary
Costs of the State-related and State-
owned Universities,” shows one way this
is inequitable.

On average, it costs $1,648 to educate a
lower division undergraduate student.
Lower division refers to a freshman or
sophomore. It costs $2,722 to educate an
upper division undergraduate student, a
junior or senior.

It costs, on average, $3,629 to educate a

I master’s student. And finally, it costs

$9,771 to educate a doctoral student.
According to the Challenge Grant, each of

these students is counted the same for
receiving the allocation.

Institutions that have high enrollments
of graduate and professional students do
not receive any extra funding, even
though their education costs the institu-
tion more. In addition, the program does
not take into account the number of part-
time students.

Part—time students, Evanto said, are typ-
ically part of the work force, paying taxes
and contributing to the community. Pitt
has a comparatively large enrollment of
graduate and professional students, as
well as part-time students.

The university receives its flexible
income from two main sources. These are
commonwealth appropriations and tuition.
When one of these is limited it creates a
strain. When both are, such as the situa-
tion with the Tuition Challenge Grant, it
causes greater problems.

Finally, because students do not directly
receive the funds, students attending insti-
tutions with lower allocations are being
penalized. Without the funding, institu-
tional quality may not grow as needed to
keep students competitive.

As part of the opposition to the pro-
gram’s inclusion in the FY 1995 budget,
the Pitt alumni association sent an
“Action Alert!” newsletter.

The newsletter was designed to generate
an alumni letter, phone call, and visit
campaign. Roughly 80 letters were sent,
as well as numerous calls and visits
to members of the state’s General
Assembly.

The alumni asked that Pitt receive an
allocation of 4.8 percent. This was in con-
junction with a joint proposal by Pitt,
Temple and Lincoln universities to give
all state-related universities an equal
increase.

In addition to these ser-

victims are further protected
by Pitt’s Sexual Assault
Guarantee.

This guarantee has been
implemented by Rick Boyd,
Pitt’s new director of Public
Safety, who also spoke at the

“He’s going to treat the

Mania. “If the victim is
unsatisfied with the investi-
gation, they can meet with

Along with being informa-

“I think that groups are

Opinions
Students don't showup

Once again, a chance for Pitt’s student body to express its
opinions has gone by the wayside. There have been two Student
Government Board open forums this year, one last Thursday and
the other on Oct. 20. Both of these forums only attracted two
people.

The Pitt News finds this disturbing. Students and faculty rarely
hesitate to criticize the university. We have all heard people
bitch and complain about how this should be done or how stupid
that decision was, etc. etc.

Now a chance comes along for people to express their dissat-
isfaction in a constructive format. What happens? You guessed
it, nobody shows up. If there really are so many problems on
this campus, then people should show up to discuss them. It is
natural to complain about the “way things are” without being
completely serious. However it is our duty as members of this
campus community to work toward making Pitt a better place
for all.

The ridiculously low turnout is merely one example of the
general apathy which runs rampant on Pitt’s campus; Getting
people involved who try to make a difference seems to be harder
than getting straight A’s.

However, all the blame should not be placed upon the student
body. SGB really needs to do a better job advertising their open
forums. It is unfortunate that a significant number of people do
not find out about them until they read the story in The Pitt
News about how nobody showed up.

Senate race picks up

The pace of Pennsylvania’s Senatorial race is starting
to pick up dramatically. A Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, WTAE-TV
poll last week showed Republican Congressman Rick
Santorum leading Democratic Senator Harris Wofford 46 to 35.
However, since that time nothing has gone right for Santorum.

Over the weekend Teresa Heinz, the widow of former
Pennsylvanian Senatorand Republican John Heinz, all but
endorsed Wofford. Wofford took over Heinz’s position in the
Senate when Heinz died in office in 1991.

Teresa Heinz referred to Santorum as “the antithesis of
John Heinz” and “short on public service and even shorter on
accomplishments.” This is a major blow for Santorum and
could swing a number of moderate Republicans into Wofford’s
camp. '

Finally Bill Clinton attended two strong rallies for Wofford
and Lt. Gov. Mark Singel in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. For
along time Democratic candidates have been wary of President
Clinton because of his high degree of unpopularity with the
electorate. However, in.the last week Clinton’s popularly, and
the popularity of Democrats in general, has jumped, and “Big
Bill” is back on the campaign trail.

All in all the Senatorial race is getting mighty interesting in
these last two weeks. The Pitt News urges everyone to exercise
‘their right next Tuesday, Nov. 8.

Four problems with I994 election

ith
the
1.9-

94 mid-term
elections only

 

days away, I
find myself
Columnist d€SI?€F3tC1Y
Tony wanting to see
Dickensheets NOV. 8 arrive

so that we will
finally be able to rid ourselves
of the filth and stupidity that
have been filling the airwaves

and newspapers for the past

few months. From all of the
polls, it seems that this is the
feeling that most people have.
Americans have been cynical
about politicians before, but
their level of disgust appears to
have reached new heights dur-
ing this campaign. And who
can blame them? Already,
many political analysts are
calling this campaign one of
the nastiest in recent memory.

My take from all of the polls
is that most Americans are
simply disillusioned by a polit-
ical system full of politicians
who say everything that people
want to hear and forget these
“promises” as soon as they
arrive in Washington. There
are several reasons why this
happens and will continue to
happen until we change our
political process. The first
thing that Americans must do
is disregard the myth that
because America is a democra-
cy the citizens run the govern-
ment. This is just nonsense,
and it’s naive to even think
that. America’s political sys-
tem is one of a representative
democracy, and it is getting
more limited in its accessibility
to the average citizen with
each passing election.

Our democracy has already
been so screwed up that it is
certain our forefathers would
no longer recognize it as their
creation. This has come about

largely because of four rea-
sons. The first is the power that
the various special interest
groups have. Although it is
true that the candidates must
campaign in a way that will get
them elected, it is undeniable
that many politicians are
bought and paid off by the spe-
cial interest groups and
Washington lobbyists. This is
especially true since so many
candidates are receiving
money from special interest
groups outside of their own
states. This presents a dilemma
in that the politicians must
decide to whom they owe their
loyalty — to their constituents
or to the special interest groups
who financed their campaign.
My bet is that they go where
the money is.

The second problem is that
many of these candidates are

_ multi-millionaires, and almost

all of them have much more
money than the average citi-
zen. Now there is nothing
wrong with people being rich
if they worked for it. That’s the
great benefit of capitalism. The
problem is that our political
system has evolved in such a
way that an average citizen can
no longer run for political
office because he/she doesn’t
have the financial wherewithal
or the backing of the special
interest groups. The fact is that
in our system the candidate
who spends the most money
usually wins the election. This
has led a large percentage of
the general public to feel that
they no longer have a viable
stake in the political process.
And as I’ve already said, their
feelings are justified.

Thirdly, we must pass a con-
stitutional amendment that will
limit the number of years that a
person may serve in Congress.
Referendums on term limits

. have already passed in several

states, and it seems clear that

our forefathers’ did not want or
intend for a person to spend his
entire life in Congress.
Because as we can see today,
when a politician spends his
entire career in Congress, his
job ceases to be about public
service; it inevitably becomes
about self—interest. This is on
top of the fact that anybody
who spends his entire life in
Congress without ever having
held another job cannot possi-
bly stay in touch with the reali-
ty of _everyday life in America.
Ted Kennedy, D—Mass., is a
perfect example of this.

Finally, most politicians are
nothing more than self—promot-
ing hypocrites. This brings us
full circle in assessing the
problems of the political sys-
tem in America today.
Politicians say anything to get
elected, even though they
know that they are in the hip
pocket of some special interest
group.

Beyond this fact, these lies
extend into all facets of their
policy positions and personal
lives. This year’s elections are
full of such misfits. Two that
come to mind are Mark Singel,
D- Pa., and Michael
Huffington, R- Calif. Singel
says that he is tough on crime,
but neglected to tell us of all of
the murderers and rapists he
has released from jail.
Huffington has said that all
illegal aliens should be kept
out of the United States, but
has just recently admitted, after
initially lying, that he hired
one as a nanny. These two hyp-
ocrites typify the majority of
today’s politicians. Whatever
happened to standards of per-
sonal responsibility and hon-
esty in this country? Like the
politicians, they’ve been
bought off.

Monday  
morning.
QB solves

polls‘  

problems  

t’s Nov.
Columnist I 1, two
David months
Saliba away from
college

football’s bowl games, and
the controversy surrounding
the rights of being the elite I
team in the nation has once
again come to life.

The USA Today-CNN
coaches’ poll has the Penn
State Nittany Lions as the
first place team, while the
Associated Press Poll has
ranked the Nebraska
Cornhuskers as No. 1.

So who’s the top team? Go
ahead and pick a side. The
polls have taken their
respective sides. 6 .
Professional football ana-
lysts have taken theirs, and
as an unqualified, opinionat-
ed, Monday morning quar-
terback type of fan, I have
taken mine.

The Nittany Lions from
Happy Valley are and should
be the unanimous choice for
the No. 1 ranking. Forget
about Nebraska. Though a
good team, they are substan-
dard to an awesome Penn
State program.

Disagree?

Let me offer a solution.
Take the path so often talked
about in a playoff system.
Sure, the controversy of who
is No. 1 and No. 2 is fun
during the season, but why
end in controversy? Or even
worse, a split for the national
title.

Take the top two teams,
Nebraska and Penn State,
and put them in a bowl and
have them play for the title.
We’ve heard this suggestion
before, and it has been met
with criticism as well as sup-
port.

Now let’s try something a
little off the wall. Take the
top four ranked teams in the
nation and have a single-
elimination playoff. Have
the No. 1 team face the No.
4 team and place No. 2
against No. 3, with each
respective winner playing
for the national title.

During the intermittent
period of this playoff, we
could watch the other less
significant bowls and not
have to deal with a ridicu-
lous matchup between two
teams that have absolutely
no business playing one
another.

For instance, if my idea
happens to go unnoticed by
the bowl coalition, we could

Pitt's Mikla, a Ieaderby example

By Adam Pincus
Staff Writer

Over the past several sea-
sons the Pitt volleyball team
has been comprised of one
key player with a supporting
cast surrounding her.

This year is a different situ-
ation, as the team is now
composed of a group of play-
ers who are all very good and
rely on each other to succeed.

One of those players is
j u n i o r
S a r a h
Mikla.

“Mikla is
always a
constant,”
sopho-
m o r e
Jennie Driscoll said. “She is
always working hard. She is
always taking care of what
needs to be taken care of. You
never have to worry about her
competing. She is probably
one of the hardest working
people I have ever met.”

Mikla is definitely not a
vocal type of player, she lets
her work ethic and her play
do the talking.

“She is definitely a leader,”
Driscoll said. “I think people
look up to her because she

 

works so hard. She is not

very vocal about anything.
She is not someone who is
going to scream and yell and
throw tantrums to get people

Strong Big

By Michael Kovak
Smff Writer

Tough losses and missed
opportunities.

These two things perfectly
describe the 1994 Pitt soccer
season.

Pitt’s record stands at 8-7-1
overall and a dismal 1-6-1 in
conference play.

The Big East soccer confer-
ence was particularly strong
this season. Connecticut,
Georgetown, Seton Hall and St.
John’s have all been ranked in
the top 20
nationally
during the
‘ year.

“ W e
have real-
ly had a
. t 0 u g h
schedule this year,” Pitt head
coach Joe Luxbacher said.
“The‘Big East is very strong.
Connecticut, St. John’s and
Georgetown, plus we have
Penn State, too.”

Pitt has two non-conference
games remaining on the sched-
ule, Tuesday at Slippery Rock
and the season finale against
No. 5 Penn State.

The Big East season got off
to a shaky start for the
Panthers.

The Panthers had revenge on
their minds when they kicked

 

fired up. Mikla is just Mikla.
She is very consistent and
solid.

“The younger players look
to see what she is doing. They

want to work out because I

Mikla works out all of the
time. She comes in strong and
in shape and with a low body

fat and everything. I think .

people look up to her exam-
ples more than anything,”
Driscoll added.

Mikla’s confidence level
got a definite boost when she

was named Big East Player of 

the Week by helping the Lady
Panthers past Providence and
Seton Hall just three weeks
ago.

That week Mikla had 45
kills, 46 digs, a .323 hitting
percentage, 2 block solos and
12 block assists.

However, when asked about
her accomplishment, the
humble Mikla was quick to
give credit to her teammates.

Being humble and low-key
is in Mikla’s temperament.
But like everyone else, she
has her moments.

“I think when Sarah makes
a really good play,” teammate
Annemarie Mernagh said,
“you see her get excited and
it is a lot of fun because
sometimes she comes out of
her shell a little bit.”

Despite her recent success
and increased confidence,
Mikla started out the season a
bit slowly.

Knut Saeter and the Panthers were 1-6-1 in the Big East.

off the ‘94 conference season
against the Georgetown Hoyas,
but none would be had, as the
Panthers lost a hard-fought 3-2
game.

During the previous season,
Georgetown kept Pitt out of the
Big East Championships with a
3-0 win.

Pitt dropped to 0-2 in the
conference after 1-0 loss to
Villanova, the third straight
year Pitt lost by that margin. A
missed Panther penalty kick
decided the game.

Pitt then traveled to New
England where they played
Boston College and

Providence.

Boston College pounded Pitt
5-1.

“BC was the only game
where we didn’t play tough,“
Luxbacher said. “The other
losses we just couldn’t get the
results.”

Results came against
Providence, Pitt’s only Big East
win. The 4-3 overtime victory
came on goal from junior for-
ward Dean Astorino.

denied by
Duquesne

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

With two very noticeable
scratches in a lineup already
lacking depth, the Pitt Hockey
Club stumbled into Saturday’s
home opener against local
powerhouse Duquesne with
few weapons in their arsenal.

It could be likened to bring-
ing a switchblade to a gun-
fight.

Predictably, that poor fella
with the blade wouldn’t be
expected to last very long.

In this case, it took about
two minutes and 15 seconds.

With three quick scores in
the game’s early moments, the

Dukes took a lead that they 4

would never relinquish and
defeated the Panthers 13-6 at
Neville Ice Arena on the
South Side this past Saturday.
The Panthers started this
game knowing they would
have to handle a strong
Duquesne team without the
help of defenseman Matt
White (broken thumb) and
forward Brad Rizzo, who
pulled out earlier in the week.

Men's, women's X-country finish sixth in Big East championships

By David Saliba
Staﬁ Writer

Facing nationally ranked
competition at the Big East
Cross Country Championships
in Boston, the University of
Pittsburgh men’s and women’s
cross country squad both fin-
ished sixth overall.

The sixth place standing,
‘ which is
out of 10
t e a m s ,
did not
reflect
the per-
formance
of the
Panther
team, head coach Steve Lewis,
said.

“You have to understand that
the Big East Conference is the
toughest and the ‘best in the
world,” Lewis said.

 

with

This is no exaggeration.
Georgetown’s men’s team, that
won the Big East
Championship, is ranked No. 1
in the nation. The Lady Friars
from Providence are No. 1 in
the nation and this year’s Big
East champions, and Villanova
is the No. 2 nationally ranked
team. -

Pitt’s performance would be
worthy of a second place finish
in any other conference, Lewis
said.

“Our kids improved as indi-
viduals and, yes, we improved
as a team, but the other schools
got better too,” Mark
Schwartz, Panther distance
coach said. “They showed a lot
of courage. They did well.”

For the men, who finished
with a total of 148 points, it
was stand—out runner Mike
Umbleby who finished third
a time of 24:24.

Impressively enough, the
senior finished ahead of
Georgetown’s top two runners,
but lost to runner-up Louis
Quintana of Villanova and
winner Bryan Spoonire of
Seton Hall.

“What we have in Mike is an
achiever and a class act,”
Lewis said.

According to Schwartz,
Umbleby’s time is the second
best performance by a male
athlete in Pitt history.

“To finish under 25 [min-
utes] on this course is some-
thing,” Schwartz said. “Mike
was just outstanding, he’s been
that way all year.”

The supporting cast for
Umbleby did not fare as well.
Dennis Kuntz (25:17) and Ed
Adamson (25:41) finished in
18th and 24th places, respec-
tively.

Yet according to the coaches,
the men did very well.

“All of them hung in there
and ran faster than they did

last year,” Schwartz said. “We
improved individually, and
that’s what you want.”

Improvement has been a
recurring theme all year for the
Panther track program, but for
the women it has been their
youth and inexperience that
has shadowed them.

“We are still very young,”
Lewis said. “Our top runner is
a sophomore, and we have
only a few juniors.”

Speaking of his top runner,
Lewis was referring to Angie
Martin, who led the Pitt
women with a time of 18:42,
good for a 23rd place finish.

“Angie ran a very intelligent
race. She ran great,” Schwartz
said.

It was the consistent
improvement of the women’s

team that impressed Schwartz. ‘

“Stephanie Ellsworth and
Stacey Anderson ran well,
both showed courage and abil-
ity,” Schwartz said.

Ellsworth finished with a

time of 19:54 for 49th place,
while Anderson, who came in
50th place, had a time of
19:58.

“You have to remember that
competitively speaking, we
could have been in last place
and still not had a bad effort,”
Lewis said. “That shows how
competitive our conference
is.’’

For Lewis and his track pro-
gram, the comp_etition will
continue when the Panthers
return to Boston on Nov. 12
for the IC4A Championships.

It is a meet that Lewis said
the Big East Championships
will help prepare them for. If
the performance turned in at
Boston over the weekend is
any indication of how the Pitt
squad will fare, Lewis remains
confident. His expectations
were met and he was
impressed.

“They were great. I couldn’t
put it any other way,” Lewis
said.

“Duquesne has much more
depth than we do  they’re
just a better team,” Panther
head coach Dick Rizzo said.
“Right now, we just need time
to get organized.”

The Dukes were led by left
winger Kevin Check, who
scored four goals and added
two assists for a six—point
night. Check scored his fourth
goal just over three minutes
into the second period, but was
held to those four goals by a
Pitt defense which improved
dramatically as the game wore
on.

Then again, with Pitt’s first
period performance as a mea-
suring stick, that unit could
hardly get much worse.

The game’s opening 20 min-
utes were a long nightmare for
the Panthers and starting goal-
tender Pat Kenny. The Pitt

coach Brian Begor said.
“When you are a big physical
player and you are not killing
the ball, I think it really
affects your confidence. Once
her shoulder got healthy and
she started killing the ball,
that just picked up all the lev-
els of the game. I think she is
such a complete player, and I
think she is really the key to
our defense.”

Mikla will be the first to tell
you that her shoulder was not
an excuse for her slow start
which is now forgotten.

Begor says that Mikla often
makes her teammates play
better because they almost
always know what she is
going to do on the court.

“She is so organized and so
balanced that she is very easy
to play defense around. She is
about the only person on the
team, in a lot of regards, you
almost always know what she
is going to do in a situation.
She is very level-headed, very
balanced.”

Mikla arrived at Pitt three
years ago from Hammond,
Wis., where she played at St.
Croix Central High School.

During high school she also
played in the Junior Olympics
and on club teams. That expo-
sure and experience is what
Mikla feels allowed her to be
noticed by Pitt.

Mikla also set a precedent
at St. Croix by being the first
athlete in the school’s history
ever to earn a Division I
scholarship.

“I chose Pitt over the other
schools because I felt com-

the Panther net.

The quicker Duquesne
squad was able to elude the
Pitt defenders and create sev-
eral odd-man scoring rushes
early on. When the horn final-
ly sounded to close out what
seemed like a never-ending
opening period. the punch-
drunk Panthers were already
down 8-1.

The second period was more
of the same. Misreads, bad
passes and players out of posi-
tion not only gave Duquesne
chance after chance to run up
the score. but they often negat-
ed Panther scoring threats.

At the end of the second
period. a goal by the Panthers’
Derek Liebrecht stopped
Duquesne’s momentum 15
seconds before the scoreboard
clock could, leaving the
Panthers behind 11-2 at the
end of two periods of play.

Finally, as the final period
began the real Panthers found
their way onto the ice.

The poor communication
and timid play that typified the
game’s first two periods was
replaced by crisp passing and
hard hitting in the third, as “the

Panthers thoroughly omplaycfi  Q

fortable with the coaches,”
Mikla said. “I had a feeling
that I really liked it here, and
I have never regretted it.”

Mikla was recruited by her
current head coach Cindy
Alvear, who was then an
assistant coach under former
Pitt coach Sue Woodstra.

“With the type of competi-
tion that we have, I feel like I
fit in well,” Mikla said. “I
don’t think I could play at
Stanford and I don’t think I
would really enjoy it. And I
wouldn’t enjoy playing at a
Division III school either. I
think I have found a happy
median.”

very well witness a matchup
in the Rose Bowl featuring
Penn State and the Oregon
Ducks.

The Ducks have no chance
of beating Penn State, let
alone making a game out of
it.

Joe Patemo and his squad
will manhandle Oregon.

A bit far south, Nebraska
will have its hands full in the
Orange Bowl against Florida
State, which is No. 8 in the
AP poll.

Now let’s draw a case sce-
nario. If Nebraska is able to
get by FSU and Penn State

decisively beats Oregon, then
who will take the title? Will
the coaches’ poll vote for
Penn State while the AP poll
votes for Nebraska?

Obviously the Cornhuskers
would deserve the title
because they beat a high-
ranked team which happens
to be the defending national
champions.

But JoePa and the Lions
manhandled Oregon 68-3,
displaying their power.

Therein lies the controver-
sy. Introduce some sort of
playoff system, do away with
conference affiliations with
the bowls and get rid of the

coaches’ poll.

Why are there two major
polls and a third that remains
a possibility in the near
future? It creates confusion
and controversy.

It’s time for one poll to -
pick one team as No. 1 and
let the controversy ride only
for the regular season.

Come Jan. 2, the polls will
split the national title, pend-
ing a Nebraska win, and the
legacy of ridiculous and con-
troversial endings will con-
tinue.

“Even after (the first two
periods), we continued to play
hard, and we ﬁnally started to
gel,” Rizzo said.

“We really came together
late in the game  we didn’t
play as bad as the final score
indicated.”

Pitt opened the third period
scoring on the power play just
45 seconds in, as Steve
Fisher’s centering pass to rook-
ie Carter Leonards found the
back of the net to cut the
Duquesne lead to 11-3.

After a Duquesne power play
goal restored their nine-goal
advantage at 12-3, Pitt’s Dan
Casagrande scooped up a loose
puck around the Duquesne net
and scored to make it 12-4
with 7:27 remaining.

Just under a minute later,

Pitt’s Leonards scored his sec-
ond goal of the night onithe
wraparound to give the
Panthers their fifth goal of the
night. Leonards would finish
the night at Pitt’s top scorer
with two goals and an assist.

Pitt’s final tally was the pret-
tiest of the night, as the
Panthers entered the Duquesne
zone shorthanded, and Fisher
scored his first goal of the
night with a backhand shot
past a sprawling Duquesne net-
minder to make it 12-6.

Duquesne put the final nail
in Pitt’s coffin with a power
play goal to end the scoring,
but not before the Panthers
could gain some much—needed
confidence before these two
teams lock horns again this
Saturday. Game time is 8 p.m.
at Neville Ice Arena.

trend with several excellent
opportunities to score, but no
goals.

The loss dropped Pitt’s con-
ference record to 1-4. They had
a week off to prepare for anoth-
er national power, Connecticut.

Before the UConn game,
hopes of improving their con-
ference record were still intact.

But the Panthers suffered
another tough 1-0 loss to the
Huskies.

The onslaught of tough oppo-
nents for the Panthers did not
let up. St. John’s, No. 14 in the
nation, was up next.

Pitt was dealt its second
straight conference shutout, 3-
0, to the Red Storm.

The game remained scoreless
through regulation.

Once again, Pitt had several
opportunities to score, but came
up short again.

St. John’s finally capitalized
on Pitt’s missed opportunities
and scored three overtime
goals. I

Pitt finished its Big East
schedule Sunday against
Syracuse.

The recurring theme of Pitt’s
entire season was also prevalent
against the Orangemen, a game
which ended in a scoreless tie.

Prex, playing in his final
home game, missed two penal-
ty kicks in the game. Either
would have sealed the victory

for the Panthers.

“If the same situation would
arise tomorrow, Prex would
still take the shot,“ Luxbacher
said.

The Syracuse game bid
farewell to five senior players.
Prex, Charlie Wasson, Kirk
Brodows, Bob Dyer and John
Lopus all played their last game
at Pitt Stadium.

 

Prex finished the Big East
season with seven goals. With
two games remaining, Prex has
28 career goals. The school
record of 35 goals belongs to
Luxbacher.

Even though several key
starters and role players are
returning next season,
Luxbacher appears concerned
with the team.

“We lost key people. The
seniors were our most consis-
tent players,“ Luxbacher said.

“The returning players are
not as consistent as they should
[be],” Luxbacher said. “We’re
going to have to be better next
season.”

Victories against Slippery
Rock_ and PSU would finish the
season on a strong note.

Even with wins in the final
two games, the Big East games
put a damper on the year.

“The whole year we just
couldn’t make the plays. It was
definitely a season of tough
losses and missed opportuni-
ties,” Luxbacher said.
