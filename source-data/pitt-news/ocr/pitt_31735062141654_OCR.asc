Expect No Violations

 

Of-the 542 bids extended by SeV€I1'
teen fraternities on the campus, 162
bids were accepted by freshmen dur-
ing the fall. rushing period. Wh1_ch
closed last evening at 5 o’clock Wlth
the end of silence period. It is ex-
pected that this total .will be increased
when parental acceptance will be re-
ceivedby some who were unable to
discuss with their parents the matter
of accepting bids, before silence pe-
riod was brought to a close yesterday.

During a nine-day period of rushing
events, which, though unlimited, did
not contain any large social events,
freshmen were accorded invitations
to smokers, dinners,‘ and informal
house gatherings to discuss the advis-
ability of becoming fraternity men.

Freshmen pledged during this sea-
son will not be eligible for initiation
until after they have earned eight
quality points in twelve semester
hours of work.

Fraternity rushing season on the
campus was conspicuous b'_Y th8_3-b‘
sence of bickering and discussions
which have accompanied previous sea-
sons. As far as can be learned, no
fraternity violated any of the rules
drawn up before the beginning of the
season. - _

Infractions of any of the rules will
be taken up at the next meeting of
Interfraternity council, which 1s to
be held November 2. ‘

The number of pledges varied from
one to twenty-three.

You Guess!

Two Drs._Whi_ting Are
Puzzle To Students
Of Genetics

 

“Have you ever had Dr. Whiting
for heredity?”

“Sure, and
grand?” . .

“He-——why, Dr. Whiting’s a she.”

-T.hat’s ho-w the ﬁght started.
Butgthey were both right——there
are two Drs. Whiting. One Dr.
Whiting is at Pitt and teaches
heredity. The other is at Penn-
sylvania College for Women and
also teaches heredity.

These Drs. Whiting are hus--
bandand wife. The Pitt_Dr. Whit-
ing is a member of the staff of
the ‘- boology department and
teaches two courses, one" in ele-
mentary heredity, which "deals for
the most _part with heredity in
connection with human beings,
and the other in genetics, which
deals with heredity in other mam-
mals. - -

His Wife is head of the biology
department at Pennsylvania Col-
lege for Women and likewise
teaches two courses in heredity—-
one in elementary and the other
in advanced.

The Pitt doctor received his Ph.
D. in science at Penn and his wife
took hers at Iowa U.

All-Solicitors
Rally Begins

YWCA Drive

Amos Speaks at Luncheon,
‘ Launching Campaign
to Meet Budget

Set Goal   of $1,200.00

“It is not a depression in money,
but a depression in the spirit of the
students ‘toward the Y. W. C. A. which
will make it hard for the solicitors to
meet the Y. budget,” said Dean Amos
in her address to the All-Solicitors
rally at Heinz House last Wednesday.
The luncheon launched the Y. W. C.
A. campaign for funds among faculty
members, friends of the Y. W., alum-
nae members ‘and students.

Watch ‘the Cathedral poster on

‘ the bulletin board outside of Al-

umni Hall for latest information

aboutthe Y. W. C. A. campaign.

When the “red arrow reaches the

top of the Cathedral the limit of
$1,200 willhavc been achieved.

Mrs. J. Howard Dice, former secre-
tary of the Y -and an alumna of Pitt,
praised the broadening of the Y. pro-
gram to meet _the needs of the stu-
dents. Other speakers were‘ A. E.
Boer, instructor in commerce, who
has been training the women in their
approach for pledges, and Dagny Ol-
sen, Ed. ’34. Helen Turner, chairman
of the ﬁnancial committee, presided.
Mrs. Men-denhall was hostess.

In order to achieve their budget of
$3,100 the Y. W. must obtain $1,200 in
gifts. A large staff of solicitors has
been organized. The following are
chairmen of groups which will solicit
among the classes: Marian Behrin-
ger, seniors; Marie Chontofasky,
juniors; Sally Thomas, sophomores»;
Doris Custer and Ann McAfee, fresh-
men. Cabinet members will solicit
the faculty.

“It is a privilege to assist in
supporting such an organization
as the Y. W. C. A.,” says Dean
Amos. “The Y. W. C. A. is the
only campus organization which.
meets the spiritual needs" of the
Women students.”

Pass Defense
2 A ids Panthers

' To ‘Stop Feared Pitt
Aerial Attack

Panthers Are Prepared

By Bob Harley
Ohio State Lantern Sports Editor.

COLUMBUS, Oct. 19.-Disappointed
at the pass defense which his team
has shown in its three contests this
season, .Coach Sam Willaman is de-
voting this week's p_ractice mainly to
that phase of the game in preparation
[for the Pittsburgh‘ tilt Saturday.

It Ohio State has been woefully weak
in a passing defense this season, and
that is the main reason for the 14-0
Michigan victory here last Saturday.

, No scrimmages are scheduled for
the Buckeyes this week, but the Scar-
let and Gray mentor will devote his
time to perfecting a defense that will
stop the Heller, Reider combination.
Carlie Cramer, Dayton, Ohio, lad,
who was chosen All-Conference quar-
terback last season, will be replaced
at the signal calling berth Saturday
by Marshall Oliphant, Cleveland
Heights boy, who was out most of
last season with an ankle injury.

Olipliant starred against Michigan
Saturday when he was sent in to re-
place Cramer, who made a miserable
showing as quarterback. Oliphant
led three offensive drives for the
Buckeyes which nearly resulted in
scores besides gaining more yardage
than any other backﬁeld man. He
played the best game any Scarlet and
Gray back has exhibited this. season.

Other changes in the regular Ohio
State lineup will see either Joe Sal-
vaterra or Max_ Padlow taking over
the left end position instead of Junie
Farrall, who sustained a wrenched
knee in the Michigan contest.

Collect Class  
Dues Today

Upper Class Women Join
in Finance Drive

.¢__

Women’s organizations of the three
upper classes are inaugurating today
a cooperative ﬁnance plan for the col-
lection of class dues. Charlotte Bair,
ﬁnance chairman of the senior class;
Suzanne Phillips, junior chairman,
and Lois Booth, sophomore chairman,

the class dues of 50 cents per student,
all day today, at a table placed under
the Alumni Hall clock. Representa-
tives from all three classes will be
stationed to explain the programs and
purposes of the class organizations.
“Wholesale collection -o-f class dues
is necessary to the adequate Workings
of class organizations,” is the state-
ment of Evelyn Blaisdell, senior class
president, “and strong class organiza-
tions more than any other factor work
as a, unifying inﬂuence in the relation-
ship of students with the University,
because they are the only organiza-
tions which progress with the devel-

;opment of the student in his four

years at school and encourage strong
alumni feeling.”

Mellon Expert

Phelps to Deliiveir Fourth
Lecture‘1of_ Serie_s__._ _-

 

The fourth of a scheduled series of
lectures by staff members of the Mel-
‘I.-311 Institute willbe given Monday
morniiig at "-10:30 o’clock in the Fel-
lows-’ room of the Institute, when
Mr. S. M. Phelps, industrial're-search
expert, will discuss “Properties a_nd
Uses of Refractories.” '

These lectures, which are opento
any students of the University inter-
ested in industrial chemistry or c1iem-
ical engineemng, are being held every
Monday for the’ purpose of acquainting
the students with allpliases of this
work. The program includes t'en‘lec-
tures of an introductory nature, all
to be given by men who are special-
ists in their ﬁelds. Following these
will be a second series of a more ad-
- vanced nature.

The 1ast,le_ctu_re was. delivered by
l\l'r. E. B. Read on “The Manufacture
of Refract.ories” aiidcontained a great
deal of material chieﬂy concerned with
the manufacture of refractories from
clay. Mr. Read also discussed the ad-
vantages and‘ ‘disadvantages of the
two majorsyste-1ns.~ of maliing brick
refractories, the periodic kiln and the
continuous tunnel kiln.

Mr. Willlani Brinker, instructor in
chemical engineering, introduced the
speaker in the absence of Professor
-H. C. Basliioum, head of the» depart-
lment of chemical engineering. ,
l A factor which has made these lec-
stures popular among the students has
;been the fact that the Mellon Insti-
‘tute specialists regularly end their

subject can be answered._

Talks Monday

‘P - prepared ‘la;

By Irving D. Robbins

The program for the homecoming
week-end celebration in connection
with the Pitt-Ohio State football game
tomorrow comprises eleven events of
major and min-or importance. Stu-
dents, faculty, and alumni of Pitt
have planned several special affairs
in many of which the ten thousand fol-
1-owers of the Buckeye eleven will
take part.

Tonight at 7 o'clock the Ohio State
football team will receive an enthusi-
astic reception when it arrives at the
Union Station. The thirty-five play-
ers and their retinue of coaches, man-
agers, and trainers will then be secret-
ed away to emerge shortly prior to
tomorrow’s game.

Three of the many dances, and
smokers will take place at the Hotel
‘Schenley tonight. First, at 8 o’clock
the Business Administration Alumni
will meet informally at a smoker in
faculty club rooms. One hour later
in the ballroom Bill Cowden’s orches-
tra. will play the first number for the
homecoming dance being sponsored
by Sigma Delta Chi. At 9:30 the gen-
eral alumni smoker for graduates of
both Pitt and Ohio State will start in
the main dining room.

Dr. Elmer Graper, head of the po-
litical science department, will ad-
dress the Business Administration
Alumni at their snicker on the topic,
“The Present Political Outlook.”

Broadcast Dance M usic

“Gold and Blue” and “Red and Grey”
will mingle in the Cotillion of the
homecoming dance. Undergraduates
of both schools will swirl to really de-
lightful music. It will be a colorful
but quite properly informal dance.
Two broadcasts will be made from the
ballroom, -one, consisting of cheers
and talks by notables of both teams,
will be-_ma,de**at—10t o’clock; the other,
song inedleys from both‘ schools, will

. . . by comparison!

Making telephone equipment presents many

an interesting problem to the engineers of Western

Electric-—manufacturer for the Bell System.

A case in point is the drying of telephone cable

before putting on the protective lead sheath. This

step is of utmost importance, for the tiny copper

wires cannot carry your voice properly unless their

paper insulation is thoroughly dried. To this end,

Western Electric engineers devised special drying
ovens in which the air is t/zirty time: drier than

desert air!

The same ingenuity and thoroughness go into

every step of making cable, telephones, switch-

boards and many other kinds of telephone equip-
ment. The dependable apparatus that results is

one reason why Bell System service is dependable.

The Student Health Service for

tem of excuses. In case of ab-
sence of three days or less, a stu-
dent is not required to get an ex-
cuse, but is to report directly to
her class room. If there is any
question on the part of the in-
structor, the student may then
report to the Student Health
Service oﬂice.

The new rest room, 221 Alumni

girls who are ill, and for those
who need rest, is now completed.

had garnered a total of 36 points in competition in

Sophomores collected 22 points.forv* .

their_ share of the ninety-and-nine,
with‘ the elderly seniors, -keeping
their distance — behind —— with 15
points for their exertions.

In the class competition, Bus Ad.
amassed a total of 36 points to lead
their College rivals by a matter of
four points. The Engineers and edu-
cation majors combineddid not reach
either school total, the miners, elec-
tricians and boilers workers garner-
ing 16 points to the “professors" 15.

Because of the earliness of the sea-
son, no record marks were hung up
by ‘the competitors, although some
rather nice times were recorded in
the_880-yard dash and mile run. Con-
nelly, ﬂying the frosh Bus. Ad. colors,
broke the tape in the 880 in‘ 2:1-0:4,
while Watkins was ‘pushed to win the
mile in 4:48:63. Elevemfeet six inches

Sixty-ﬁve students and campus wide
contested together ‘in the ﬁrst part
of the program on the ﬁrst track and
field games, Wednesday afternoon in
the Stadium, to give themselves a
workout and to show what material
is available so far_as track.'is- con-
cerned, to be molded for the spring
games and meets.

 It was not expected that very fast
times would ‘be recorded in the
dashes, the students not having the
time to prepare for the program.

But this turned out to be diﬁerently
when the gun cracked for the ﬁrst
race. The boys wereout to show just
what they could do, which was con-
siderable. ‘ ‘ 1
4N0 individual stars can easily be!
picked among those competing in the;
events the other afternoon. All‘
were good, while possibly the experi-
ence of the upperclassmen, made
these men seem more capable than
the ﬁrst year men. Experience was«
the only thing they had in their favor,
and a tabulation of the results shows
that more than experience is neces-
sary to win track meets.

In all, the meet was a. successful
one frointhe standpoint of the com-
petitors, and those interested in see-
ing the boys go through their paces.

Winners in the events will be
awarded gold, silver, and bronze
medals at a get-together smoker,

Tuesday evening in the Y hut.

The program for this afternoon’s
portion of the meet include-s the 12-
pound shot and hammer throws, dis-
cus, javelin throws which are to be
run off in the practice football ﬁeld,
beginning at 3 o'clock.

on Fall Program

   

W. A. A. announces its major fall
sports to be golf, riding and riﬂery.

with the student body.”

the faculty members can be given on
Wednesdays from 4 to 5 o'clock and
Thursdays from 3 to 4 o’clock, Ten
people will be permitted in each class
for 25 cents per hour. Other periods
may be arranged for groups at the
same rate, or private instruction will
be given for $1.00 per half hour.

W. A. A. has secured the services
of Andrew Patrick, a professional golf
instructor, to teach the classes. All
interested’ women should sign the
posters either in Alumni Hall or in
the gym, or see ‘Margaret Klein, Ed.
’34, W. A. A. golf manager.

The second main sport, riding, will
take place at Rosalyn Farms Wednes-
days and Fridays, 3530, and Saturdays
at 9. o’clock and 2 o’clock. The charge

Panthers Prepare
For C)hio State

In a game that is an absolute toss-
up, no matter which way one looks at
it, Pitt and Ohio State will meet on
the browning turf of the Pitt Stadium
Saturday afternoon.
third meeting -of the two schools in
four years, and up to now all is even
——both institutions having one win to
its credit.

Pitt won in 1929 by a 18-2 score,
without showing too much power, in
a game played on a soggy slippery
gridiron. That was the day that Ohio
State's Wesley Fesler, and Pitts-
burgh's Joe Donchess met to decide
which should be an All-American. If
we remember rightly, Mr. Donchess
won.

His loss of prestige, if there was
such a loss, must of rankled for he
acted like a half a dozen ball players
the following year, when Pitt repaid
O*hio’s visit at Columbus. The ﬁnal
score of that game was 16-7 in favor
of the Buckeyes, and Fesler was re-
;sponsible for each Buckeye tally,
pass,

ity evenly matched. Ohio has a team
ﬁof veterans, only two regular-s from
'-the 1931 machine being lost, while
‘Pitt has but three regulars of 1931 in
ithe lineup, yet the betting will be
i even.

i In some strange manner Ohio has

fmanaged to be tied by Indiana, and,
§to be beaten—or rather outscored by‘
3 Michigan.

On the other hand, Pitt
.minus its stars, had come along unde-
gfeated, although it had a narrow es-
gcape at the hands of the Army last
3 Saturday.

3 But the potential power of the Ohio
team is too well known to allow them
.to be underestimated by the Pitt
Ecoaching staff, and Dr. Jock Suther-
lland will have his team prepared to
[meet a team that is better than any
"foe met to date.

Ohio can match Pitt ball-carrier for
' ball-carrier, passer for passer, blocker
for blocker in the backﬁeld, and it
has a line that is heavier, faster and
more experienced than Pitt’s forward
wall. _

The answer should be an Ohio vic-
tory, but the great spirit of
the Pitt team, evidenced in the
Army game, will keep the Panthers
from going into the game, the under-
dogs. _ ‘

Willaman, coach of the Buckeyes,
warned Jock early in that year, that if
Ohio lost to Michigan, Pitt had better
watch out. That has happened and
Pitt is watching out.

back, will rest the burden of the
Pitt attack. Heller, probably, is- the
outstandini back of the country today,
and he wil1.be the man for Ohio to
stop. The Scarlet and Grey warriors
will ﬁnd the task difficult, for when
Mr. Heller is stopped on the ground
he takes to the air, and usually with
devastating effect. ,. ,

Ohio State can counter with Carl
Cramer, All-Conference quarterback,
who is another triple threat artist,
and he has a strong “supporting cast in
the Vuchinich, Carrol and Hinchman
array, a trio that equals Heller’s com-
bination of Weinstock, Reider and Ho-
gan.

Pep Rally!

Students to Mass Friday on
Eve of Notre Dame 3
Football Game

Followers of the Pitt football
team win have an opportunity to
work up some enthusiasm for a.
victory -over Notre Dame at an
outdoor pep rally to be held on
the eve of the big game. The
giant bonﬁre on Ruskin‘ ﬁeld,
scene of the scheduled rally, will
be lit at 7:30 o’clock Friday eve-
ning, October 29.

Plans for the demonstration
have been drawn up by a com-
mittee under the chairmanship of
Betty Quarrie, student council as-
semblies chairman. Students of
the Dental and Engineering
schools and members of the ROTC
will attend enmasse and attempts
are being made to organize sim-
ilar large groups. _

Jimmy Hagan, former star half-
back at Pitt and now assistant di-
rector of athletics, and Chester
Smith, sports editor of the Pitts-
burgh Press, are scheduled speak-
ers for the rally.

Other members of the committee
in charge of the rally are: Tom
Savage, Eng. ’33; Elaine Blan-
velt, Col. '34; Victor ‘Mattison,
Eng. ’33; June. Miller, Bus. Ad.

of members made trips over various
trails, and studied the
plant life of the forest.

At the club’s meeting Thursday
evening, Dr. Robert Hance of the
Zoology department talked on “Ren1—

edly will start at fullback instead of

. Wetzel has been crowding out Vuch-

inich for the fullback post, and
against the Wolverines appeared to
be more ‘of an offensive threat than
Vuchinich.

, The rest of the lineup probably
will ﬁnd Gillman at right end, Dick
Smith as center, Varner and Gailus,
guards, and Monahan and Rosequist
as tackles.

Captain Lew Hinchman, who played
the best game of his football career
against the Maize and Blue, will be
left halfback, and Bill Carroll, who
is affectionately called “the blonde
express,” will be at the right half-
back position. Carroll ran 50 yards
after catching a pass in the Michigan
game before being forced out of
bounds.

Some 300 students and Ohio State’s
All-America band of 150 pieces will
accompany the team to Pittsburgh for
the grid encounter.

 PITT

BITS '3'

From the publicity that has been!
passed around lately, one would sus-
pect that Pitt meets Ohio State to-
morrow and that Pitt is a top-heavy
favorite to win.

You are also reminded that Ohio
State does not have as good a rec-
ord as the Panthers this year, but
that the Buckeyes are about set
to cut loose, and will likely do so
tomorrow, much to the dismay of
the Panthers.

The Panthers are touted as one of
the teams in the running for the myth-
ical nati-onal championship, and al-
though they defeated Army last week,;
did not show much power except at:
infrequent intervals. Three times, to}
be exact, each time for a touchdown.

Pitt _has beaten Ohio State once
and the Buckeyes have returned
the compliment. It seems, fro-m
a;’l¢| indication.-s, that -it will ‘be
Pitt's turn tomorrow.

Ohio State will have what is prob-
ably the greatest aggregation of blue-
blooded beef that will appear -on the
Pitt Stadium in many a long winter
evening. For instance, -Monohan, 216

pounds; Nelson, 230 pounds; Yards,
202 pounds. All meat, F. O. B., Co-
lumbus_

Although the line will be beefy,
it will also have speed and a good
set.of executive brains to guide it,
in the person of Cramer.

Jock Sutherland has been quoted as
not in favor of the Panthers being
quoted as pre-game favorites, but to-
morrow is likely to see just this very
thing being done.

New York -sports writers are
still harping on the Panther’s
victory over the cadets, and have
even gone so far as to make re-

marks not complimentary to Pitt

as a whole. E’en the well known

“Panther” came in for a bawling ,_

out for not facing the Army Mule.

when the mule showed signs of
wanting to kick something.

One writer called Pitt the Orange
and Blue and spoke -of mighty, tre-
mendous, monstrous and immense for-
ward passes. In the next paragraph
the Panthers were called Juggernauts.
That’s the animal that never forgets.

Muggsy Skladany, who scored
Pitt's second touchdown and didn't
know it, was the victim of what
the common people call lapse of
memory, suffered from an ex-
tremely hard knock on the cran-
ium. By playing throughout the
first half and scoring in the bar-
gain, he demonstrated just how

far a strong will will carry a.

player. Additional congratula-

tions are tendered,

A Duquesne enthusiast, from the
North Side district, who never attend-
ed grade school, has been mean
enough to suggest that all money won
on the Panthers against the Cadets
should be refunded. . ’

The First Annual University

Track and Field meet would be a
much greater success from the
student standpoint if varsity let-
termen and freshmen numeral
winners were not allowed to com-
pete.

The Pitt band has been in earnest
consultation on the best manner in
which to show Ohio State's famed
band who’s who. Why not start pa-
rading first and not leave the field
until it’s time for the second half to
begin. Then Ohio State enthusiasts
would have nothing to brag about.

35 Attend Successful
YM- YWCA Fall Retreat

Thirty-ﬁve students and faculty
members of the University attended
the annual Y, M.-Y. VV. C. A. fall re-
treat at Trinity Manor October 14-15.
Arthur Charlesworth, C01. ’33, chair-
man of the affair, reported that it was
one of the m-ost successful events of
its kind sponsored by the two campus
associations. 1

Frank Olmstead, Y. M. C. A. secre-
tary at New York University, was
the leader of the group. Mr. Olmstead
discussed “Emergent Evolution” and
urged the students present to take
greater interest in the social prob-
lems of the day. '

New Club Opens Activities
With Disarmament Forum

A newly organized International Re-
lations Club will begin its activities on
the campus with a meeting in room
107 at 3:30 o’clock Mond'ay afternoon.
The club is sponsored by the Y. M. C.
A., the Y. W. C. A. and the interna-
tional relations classes of Dr. Benja-
min Williams, professor of political
science.

Joseph Cohen, delegate to the Inter-
national Anti-VVar Congress in Am-
sterdam, Holland, last August, will be
the speaker. An open forum on the
question of disarmament will be held
following the address.

Homecoming Celebration

HOUSANDS of Pitt and Ohio State alumni, their families and
friends,’ will be in the city tonight and tomorrow for the events

included on the Homecoming week—end program.

A downtown parade by the bands of both universities, alumni
meetings and a general smoker, and the Publication Dance for -stu-
dent and alumnus provide a colorful day of pre-game entertainment.
The climax of the.week-end’s festivities will come tomorrow with
theﬁnal whistle in the Pitt-Ohio State game. A

VVin or lose, -Pitt fraternities will celebrate the game and the

pledging of their new members

tomorrow night. Thus the 1932

Homecoming celebration will be spent.

The Alumni Association, the University administration, the pub-
lications, fraternities and athletic department are all working to
make the week-end a success. With the general student body behind
each. of these events, as it is hoped they will be, the program cannot
fail to please and impress our guests.

"One observer in the Stadium Wednesday afternoon reported
having seen a total of ten students——not actual contestants in the
events—-—standing by with the appearance of interested spectators.

That constitutes a new record in

Stadium attendance. But there is

no reason why that fact should dim the success of the meet.

Wednesday ’s meet, thanks to

Coach Carl Olsen and the athletic

department, was one for the athlete, not for the spectator. All the
applause that any contestant received came from his fellows and the

ﬁeld ofﬁcials.

for itself a place of major importance on the athletic calendar.

day. * . 

Announcement of candidates trying
out successfully this week will be

Further tryouts for candidates who-

have not yet been heard will be con-
ducted next week on Tuesday and
Thursday from 12:30 to 2230, during
regular meetings of the association in

The sophomore class has organized
a new committee to acquaint all soph-
omore women with class affairs. Ac-
cording to Sarah Thomas, E»d., chair-
man of the committee. the cards and
letters sent to the students before an
event are too impersonal and fail to
bring much response.

The personnel committee is headed
by Sarah Thomas, who is a member
of the sophomore cabinet. Under the
chairman are seven sub-chairmen:
Mildred Seder, Col.; Dorothy Kauf-
man, Col.; Rosalyn Alexander, Ed.;
Helen Bruun, Col.; Alice Elson, Col.;
Marian Epping, Bus. Ad., and Mar-
jory Lycette, Col. ’

Each of these sub-chairmen has
seven committee women working
under her. Each committeewoman
has a list of ﬁve sophomore women
to inform of each affair.

Depression U.

A “Depression University” opened
early this month in the hills of Vir-
ginia, not far from Washington, D.
C. It is a school at which the fac-
ulty will teach for its room and board
only. About 100 students are ex}-
pected, each of which will pay a fee
of $250, covering all expenses for the
year. There will be no football team
at deah ole “D. U.” but anyone wish-
lng to win his “D” can do so in hunt-
ing‘ or ﬁshing. The idea is that after
a hard day’s workout, athletes will
come home with the “bacon” instead
of a lot of sprains and aches. Dr. A.
C. G. Hill, Jr., professor of economics
at Springﬁeld College, evolved the
plan. No revolutionary teaching
methods are planned, nor will the
school be unduly conservative. The
purpose, it seems, is to utilize unem-
ployed teachers.

Why Worry?.

There are only two things to
worry about: either you have to
go to school or you don’t. If you
don't, you have nothing to worry
about; if you do, you have only
two things to worry about. Either
you are going to study, or you are
not going to study. There are
only two things you have to worry
about. Either you will pass or
you will fall. If you pass, you
need not worry; and if you fail,
you will be so busy shaking the
hands of similar friends that you
wont have any time to worry.

All along we have felt that many
shifts in the contemporary panorama
have been neglected. No newspaper,
of course, can hope to cover all. We
moderns are too interested in every-
thing for that. But some elements
ought to be included. Just what is
happening around us now? Just what,
for instance, is happening in the way
of art about Pittsburgh? This is an
absorbing sidelight. _We rub against
it every day, and it is rife with the
keenest interests—new ‘books filling
the windows each week, recitals and
concerts being given, buildings going
up, exhibitions being hung and show-
lights drawing their continuous
streams of people. Shouldn’t there be

some considerati‘on .of"‘the's‘e?‘We feel

this column will fill’ the need in part,
not so much. as an'_‘artis_tic evaluation
as a consideration and ‘guide-‘post to
some of the more interesting aspects
in this field. .ﬂ  " .   ,

The Schenley Depresslon Art Ex-
hibition struck us_ as being quite a
new note. We dropped by the hotel

mediately 'caught'a suggestion of old

they will hang at the Contemporary
Art Center exhibition, to open the last
part of the month downtown, at Bob
Young’s and McCurdy’s studio. We
shall keep an afternoon open for this.

To come into the world of books,
we find another item of present in-
terest in Pearl S. Buck’s new novel.
Sons was certain to be interesting to

all of us who read The Good Earth.

Unfortunately it proved just another
sequel. It has little of the ease and
charm with which its predecessor al-
lowed the East to step quietly into
our lives. As a story Sons has ex-
citement, but the book is too long,
has many dull digressive Passages,
and is clearly an attempt to draw
our pleasant interest in Wang Lung’s
family through several hundred pages
of a new novel. We can’t help wish-
ing its virtues had been combined
with those of The Good Earth to make
of an interesting novel a sound lit-
erary performance.
