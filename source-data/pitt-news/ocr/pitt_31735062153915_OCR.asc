_The preliminary training for the
s\ea-son which will probably decide the
;fate of baseball at the University of

 Pittsburgh, was inauguratedearly last
. , "week under the able tutelage of Coach

Blair. At t_he same time the Manage-

Zinieirit came forward with the an-
'» nouncemen-ti of'the scheduling of an

additional -game which will be played

. ’ with the Alumni Saturday, April 21.

MEDALS "GIVEN WINNERS

The Freshman Basketballers proved
their right to represent the University
of Pittsburgh when _ they. Won four
straight matches in the Middle At-
lantic "States Basketball Tourney just
completed, thereby giving theni the

Liberty Y. M. C. A., 38 to 30 in the
ﬁrst roun_d; Mansﬁeld Club, of Mc-
Keesport, 27 to 26; the .First U. P.
Church, of Oakland, 50.to 21, in the
semi-ﬁnals; and- easily downed the
Sewickley Y. M.  A. in the ﬁnal,
38 to 28. A , ' . . A
With these wins the Freshmen com-
plete a schedule of 20 wins _out_of 22
games, a performance which has never
been "equaled by a freshman team in
the history of the School. Manager
G. H. Davis, Ec. ’18, has withthe aid
of Coach “Butch” Ochsenhirt, thus de-
veloped a wonderful team, a ‘team
V\l1lCl’1 should mean a great deal to the
Varsity next year. Davis has been
appointed manager of the Varsity next
year,-and should he bring about as
successful a team and schedule as he
has this year, his name will long be
remembered in the annals of Pitt.
East Liberty Y. M. -C. A. was the

the ﬁrst year men in the tourney,

the Pitt men leading by onlyione
point at the end of that time, the
scoring being 15 to 14. However,’ at
the end of .this'time the Pitt men let
loose and ran away from their op-
ponents, getting nine" ﬁeld goals in
this half alone. Levine, Penman and
Reiscgen led in the scoring. each ‘get-
ting four ﬁeld goals, though Penman
made in addition'10'out of 16 fouls.
For East Liberty, Apie‘ played the
bestiigame.‘ The game ended: Pitt,
38; East Liberty, 30. , ‘ -
The second game was with the W.
D. Mansﬁeld team of McKeesport,

‘who gave Pitt the hardest run for

their money inthe tournament. The
score was only 27 to 26 at the end of
the game, thoughthe Gold and Blue
men led by ‘5 points at the end of the
ﬁrst period. The game was marked
by the fouls rather than the ﬁeld goals
made, Penmanmaking 11 out of 16
fouls, and Kﬁie, of Mansﬁeld, 19 out
of 30 fouls. Pitt made only eight
field goals, Reisgen making four, and
Levine three. of-these, and Mansﬁeld
made only three goals from the ﬂoor,
Ramsey ‘having two and Kline, one.
In this game McLean wasabsent,
which .to a great extentaccounts for

ing'would have spelled a‘ different
story had he been in the game.

In the semi-ﬁnals the First U. P.
Church of Oakland, was taken on,

nen, in.fact, never giving them a hard

ous. Reisgen proved himself supe-
rior to his opponent Replogle who had
played such .a ﬁne game all season for
the Schenley High 'School, never al-
lowing him to get a ﬁeld goal‘ while
he ‘himself made six of the baskets.
Penman follows i Reisgen in ﬁeld
goﬂs, getting 5 baskets and made in
addition, 16 out of 20 fouls. M»cKib-
ben and Dougherty were the only
men to make basketsifor the Church
team, each -making two. The game
ended with the score S0-.*-?~to 21.

The ﬁnal game ‘of the series proved
almost as easy a contest for our_men
as had the previous contest, qthey
winning froinithe Sewickley Y. M. C.
A. by the, score _of 38 to 28.

men as their chances for winning
looked very ‘small, even before the
game had started, in view .of the fact
that the, Sewickleyites,had so easily
defeated its opponents in the previous

igaines of the series, and had also

‘Dear Bob:—-' 7 ' -

Your letter of March 28 was waiting
for me -one Saturday when I returned
to Columbus from one of _my numer-
_ous trips.. I was. glad to hear‘ from
you, even if it was toitell me that
you want to inject‘more work, into
an adready busy l-ife.

The effort to enlarge the member-
ship of the Alumni Association is a
commendable one, and I am heartily’
in, sympathy with it, Unfortunately,
my work keeps me out of the, city

a good bit," but you may count on _

me to d'o.'all I can to bringcreditto
your‘conImittee.- -1 - ‘ t.
For. s-ome time ~I.’ve‘been wishing
I might ﬁnd time to attempt the or-
ganization of a 'Centr.al Ohio, Pitt
Club". There ae 901' 10 alumni here
in-Columbus and presumably there are
quite a few-alumni inithe towns in
.this‘vicin'ity. Membership on your
-committee will give me an,op_por-
tunity to kill two birds" with one
stone. _ o
I hope ~t-o visit personally‘ all the
men in Columbus. Yesterday I suc-
ceeded in . obtaining . the membership
-of the two alumni that I was able to
visit.. . - “ --

No. 14- and theyhave 14 members.
W. VV. '(“Waldy"') Zieg, '10, is one
of his best workers, and he has se-
He
‘has written a lot of letters to the
men (and women) who attegded back
in the '06-’l0 days, and these letters
are bringing results. When “Dutch’.~'_
was running the annual W. U. P. In-
tercollegiate and » Interscholastic track

meets .'(which, by the way, ‘he worked '

up to the present high ‘stage, of devel-
opment)-, "his forte was letter writing.
Every detail of..the meet was covered

by a conﬁrrﬁg letter, and when -the .

day of the,._me.et came_.around*cv_ery-

one knew just when he was"to rc- .

port, when things‘-started, etc. _His‘.
letters “delivered the goods”. and we
predict that his letters in this cam-
paign are goingto do the "very same
thing. Dr. T. ‘W. Grayson,-'97, who
was Secretary of the Alumni-.Assoeia-
tion of the old West Penn Medical
School for many years, is on this
team and Capt 'M‘cCrady expects to
get a number. of members through
him. E. C. -Shaler, ’93, who is lo_-
ca-ted in'Broo_klyri, is a worker who
has ‘-been heard from and who prom-
ises to ﬁnd a number from the -City
of Churches. He is a lqgal -Pittite
and a former W. U. P. athletic and
musical‘c1ub performer. - .

lucky number," at ‘least ‘three teams
don't’ think so. __Team__s 3, 4 andf19,-

C. R. Foster, '11, and ,-,B. H. Smyers,

There is a lot. of good talent on this

is_ always to beat ‘his .sideWk-ick.‘

 a” meeting‘ of the -Advisory
Board last night, two important mat:
xters were brought up in.con'nection
with student aetivities. ' There was
considerable debate on the question
of the dis‘penVsation of _the funds for
studentactivities. As it stands now,
the‘. PITT WEEKLY and‘ .the Cap
and Gown Club eachjreceive $1 from
every student for_act,iviti’es._ The plan
before the Advisory Board is to re-
adjust this arrangement so that some
activities may receive more money.

The otlierimportant matter under
discussion was the advisability of hav-
ing a graduate manager of activities.
Activities now are conducted by stu-
dent managers, with the exception.of
the Cap and Gown, Club and the .VatVh-
letic "activities of the University. The
plan is tp have_»a manager that will.
‘be able to supervise the activities and
see that they are Vefﬁcie_ntV1y conducted-
on sound business‘ principles.‘ V

PHARM. NEWS V

tsociati-on':, a list of*_thed_Pharrniacy
“Unknowns” in. the .newVv Alumni

official organ of that associat-ionV,
“The? Western Pensylvania "Retail

about all the retailers in this sec-
tion of "the Keystone Statepitwill
‘und.oubtedl’y_‘ ‘enable us_ to locate
many of the former students’ of the
Pharmacy school 'whose_ _addresses
are not known. _ P ~ P‘

. The Alumni page will devote con-
siderable space each week tothe_ ac-
tivities of the Pharmacy school, as
many-of the graduates and former
of, that ,'Vc_lepa.r‘tment are
meIVnbers of-the Association. News
from-these grads .will be welcome
at all times._ In'VVthe travels of the
Alumni Secretary-toethe various Pitt
club meetings he’ always ﬁnds a loyal
crowd of_Pharmacy men and they
are strong boosters for the Urrive;-
sity. We "want to keep-this spirit
ever alive. _ .- '
._'An effoﬁt is_ also beingmade -toV get
.Vmo’re of‘ ‘the; news ‘in the WEEKLY
from. the Pharamcy school through
student. ‘reporters. _At the recent
l_>anquetV given. -in honor ofVDr. Judd
atV‘V the William} Penn hotel, VVthe Sec-
retary mentioned ‘thisofact and
stated that after invesVtiga_tion he
had discovered the fault did-«not lie
with the PITT WEEKLY staff, as
they were" anxious to print the news.
The trouble was that news v‘v'a_s ‘not
supplied f’romV that school. Heurged
the Pharmacists‘ to elect their re-
porters andVget the news in re-
gularly. To date nothing has been
done but it is Vhoped to effect an ar-
_rangement.fso_o_n.‘ ,

‘With ‘the number of Pharmacy
grads who..are «members ofV the As-
sociation and getting the WEEKLY,
the Secretary is anxious .that they
get all the late news regarding-ac-
-tivities at their school as it will help
keep their interest in the WEEKLY
and "the Alumni Association alive-

Have Pharmacy alumni any sug-
gestions to offer?

ng. ' Other nominations may be made

In the- coming issues of the PITT

WEEKLY, the names of all members

now so large that it will be neces-
sary to split it up among a‘ number of_
issues.- As delinquents pay .up and
new members ‘are added from week to

Those who desire to make nomina-
tions, therefore an tell ‘by Vthis list

nominations of good men, if any have
been missed by ~the Nominations
Committee, will be gladly accepted.
Of course, the new‘ Directory con-
tains a list of mar_1y.of the members-
but as several hundred have come in
since it was published, it" is thought
best to publish this complete list in
the WEEKLY. , . V ' '

A new“-portable stage built and
equipped in modern fashion for the
pres_entation‘ ‘of ‘drama on - a scale
hitherto Vunattempted by them, -is to
be the 1atest_addition, to the property
of the Pit’: Players. Modeled" on the
plan of the Little Theater, yet con-
siderably larger than" that of Stuart
,Walker’s successful company, the
building of the stage has already been
-plannedV-and‘ Work ‘begun upon it.
When completed, audit is expected
this will be done -before May 1st,. the
stage wil have -an opening of thirty
ﬁve feet in front with a depth of
twenty-four, feet. This means that
it will extend all the way across one
end of the gymnasium. VA large pro-
scenium is already completed together
with ‘several pieces of specially con-
structed scenery to make a thor--
oughly theatrical .ap’pear.ance.

The biggest activity of the year for
the Pitt Players, i_t.-is announced will-
be in the first part ofVMay.. One-act
plays will be produced for three‘cVon-
secutive evenings, on two of which
students will be permitted to attend
tickets being‘ supplied. ' _ V

The same'week, the Drama'League.
Convention. will meet in Pittsburgh
and the three plays will be presented
.before the Convention one evening.
This is considered a great distinction
and botlrthe actorsand workers are
striving to attain to the highest pos-
sible stajndard, for the Vproduction
under the Directorship of Prof. G.
M. P. Baird. ’ » 7

Three plays will be produced each
‘evening as -has been-the custom in the
past: . Two of the plays are already
nearly ﬁnished for presentation, the
casts having begun rehearsals s'ome
time ago. A ‘

the work at Pitt. The’ aim  to have

Pitt men who are employerslocate ~ V

Pitt, students when they have open-
ings in their own ‘business or in other
concerns they know of. It al1Vhelps
to -create a greater spiritfor Pitt and
helps sew up the community- for the
University. ‘ T -'

This ‘last week one of» the alumni
Vcalled up the Secretary’s.oﬂice wre-
gartlingga -?position for a Mechanical
Engineer with 6 or 8 years’ experi-
ence, stating ‘he knew of an open-
ingthat would pay between $175 and
$200 to the right, man. Every day
inquiries ofth-is sort «reach us. The
Secretary co-operates with Mr. Hal-
lock of the Engineering facultyin
locating me_n for these positi_ons.

are.Vﬁ~l1e,d" -by co-operation. with the

The Employment ’ Bureau Vfeature
at Pitt,_is one in-which a tremendous
[amount of good can be done for
thei alumni who are emplVoy-ers as
well as for the one who is ‘seeking
totbetter his position. As stated in a
recentissue of the WEEKLY, it is
hoped to tackle this ‘problem along
big lines ‘in the near future, with
