Current Student Government
Board members are concerned
that SGB candidates have been
or are planning to give small
tokens, such as candy, to voters.
These tokens may constitute a
bribe, according to some SGB
members.

Theresa Wilson, elections-
committee chairperson, said that
candidates asked the committee

constitute a bribe under the
elections code. Elections for the
1991 SGB will be held on Nov. 7.

The committee ruled that items .
costing less than 50 cents and

stating details concerning the
candidate and the campaign do
not constitute a bribe.

“Our ruling states that candy,
pens, pencils, buttons and other
small—value items costing less than
50 cents do not constitute a bribe
provided that it states who you
are, what you are running for and

said that the new election rule
“makes a mockery of the election
and trivializes the election to a
great extent.”

According to Batchelor, there
is “a certain respect and dignity
associated with theSGB election.”
Candidates would be disgracing

the election by handing out candy

or pens, Batchelor said.

“I think it’s disgracefulfor future
SGB members to be handing out
candy so people will vote for
them,” he said, “whether or not,

Board member Donald Rhodes
disagreed. He saidthat candidates
are given an amount of money to
spend on whatever the believe to
be their best means of
advertisement.

“What the candidates decide to
spend their money on is their
choice,” he said. “If they choose
to put an ad on [Public
Broadcasting Service], they can

Racism on college campuses concerns activists

By Milt Klopfer

Senior Stajf Writer

Marcus Guy’s first racial experience did not
happen to him at Pitt, but it made him aware
of the walls of misunderstanding that still
stand between blacks and whites more than
20 years after the civil-rights movement.

Guy was attending a leadership camp in
New Hampshire and discovered that out of
about 300 students, he and two others were
the only blacks there.

“The first thing that happened is that [my
black friends and I] came down a path, and
some white students said, ‘Hey man, you’re
black. I bet you can rap, huh?’ And I said, ‘Hey
man, you’re white. I guess you can play the
guitar, huh?’ I began to [wonder], ‘What’s
going on here?”’

Guy’s experience was one of five different
perspectives offered by five black students
attending predominantly white colleges. The
panel convened at Oakland’s Rodef Shalom
Temple as part of the YWCA’s “Combating
Racism” conference, which was held Friday
not only to tell about racism in American
society but also to develop methods to fight
it.

After coming to Pitt, Guy, a member of the
Black Action Society, was to see similar
patterns repeated in the interactions between
blacks and whites on campus.

“Most of the time [Pitt black students are]
the only African American student in the
classroom, and [they’re] expected to be experts
on all African American issues,” he said.

Choosing not to live up to the expectation,
Guy has sat in classes silently while his white

classmates called the idea of having mandatory
cultural-diversity courses “stupid,” and the
issue of black slavery called “ridiculous,
because blacks enslaved their own people.”

The frustration, said Guy, comes not only
from hearing such attitudes expressed but
also from the failure of his other classmates
to challenge such views.

It is this lack of interest and often downright
opposition to the issues of racial prejudice
and civil rights that prompted speaker Charles
T. Vivian, chairperson of the Center for
Democratic Renewal, an anti—Klan and anti-
hate-group organization, to call colleges the
scene of today’s civil-rights struggle.

“As we look at [Louisiana senatorial
candidate] David Duke, we have seen a
breakthrough [of overt racisml into the

Greeks
retain
alcohol
policy

By Jim Wechsler
StaffW'riter

Leaders of Pitt’s Greek system
say that a “bring your own booze”
policy at fraternity parties
wouldn’t Work and isn’t needed
at Pitt.

Inter;Fraternity Council
President Tony Spinola, IFC Vice
President Brent Saunders and
Assistant Director of student
activities Bridget Guernsey were
called together Wednesday
evening to discuss the
ramifications of the University of
Pennsylvania IFC’s recent
decision to institute a “bring your
own booze” policy within its
Greek system.

Under the BYOB policy,
fraternities and sororities are not
allowed to purchase alcohol with
chapter funds. The Penn IFC
policy requires that a professional
bartender from outside the
organization be hired for
functions in which alcohol is
served. One room is set aside for
the service and consumption of
alcohol. Only people over the
age of 21 are permitted in this
room.

. The University of Pittsburgh’s
IFC follows a policy that adheres
to state and university alcohol
regulations but is not BYOB.
Under this system, all G_reek
parties are “closed,” which means
that only invited guests may
attend. The guest list must be
turned in to the IFC before the

party can be held, and it must be t

enforced. No underage drinking
is permitted. Guests are carded
and receive hand stamps or wrist
bracelets which clearly designate
them as over or under 21 years of
age. This policy has been in effect
ever since a Liquor Control Board
raid two years ago forced the IFC
to crack down on the problem of
alcohol at Greek functions.

“I don’t think Pitt needs BYOB,”
said Saunders. “It wouldn’t work
at Pitt,” he added.

Saunders said that most of the
fraternities on the hill have only
one party room, which would
make it difficult to separate
overage and underage drinkers
according to Penn's policy. He
also said that separating the
students would discourage
mingling between older and
younger members.

“I think [Pitt’s policy] is the best
for Pitt because it allows the

Continued from page 1
‘Westrnoreland Country Club.’ I
don’t think they’re bribing me to
come play golf there just because
they gave me a pencil with their
name on it.”

Wilson told the board that by
passing a motion prohibiting the
distribution out of small—token
items during SGB campaigning,
the board is treating students as if
they cannot think for themselves.

“You are saying that these
people are easily swayed,” she
said. “You're basically telling the
undergraduate _ student
population that ‘We’re going to
protect you because you’re
morons.”

Despite the controversy, a
motion was passed stating that
there will be no handing out of
Small-token items, excluding pins,
buttons and flyers during SGB
campaigning. The vote, however,

was nulliﬁed after the meeting by
Alan Rosenthal, SGB judicial-
committee chairperson, who said
that Michael Cohen, a candidate
for the upcoming presidential
election, should abstain from the
vote.

Rosenthal cited provisions in
Roberts’ Rules of Order, which
the SGB uses, that state if a vote
in question directly affects an
individual with personal interests
exclusive to one member, that
the member abstain from voting..

By disqualifying Cohen’s vote,
the decision went
Rosenthal said that he ordered a
mail in re—vote of all board
members, as two were absent
from the proceedings. “I thought
that since this is an important
policy decision, you want it to be
a board decision,” said Rosenthal
of the motion passing with only
three affirmative votes. He said

3-2, but .

he expected to receive the votes
early this week.

“[Cohen] didn’t have any hidden
agenda,” said Rosenthal. “People
might point a finger at Michael
when he didn’t do anything
wrong.”

Cohen said, “I understand that.
I wasn’t told beforehand that I
wasn’t allowed to vote. After
[Rosenthal] referred to Roberts’
Rules, it’s Ligons’ justified.”

In other business,
Presidentjulie Shepard addressed
the issue concerning Black Action
Society Chairperson Doug
Ligons’s questioning of
presidential-search Committee
Appointee Lisa Campoli’s
qualifications and the number of
students assigned to the
presidential-Search committee.

According to Shepard, no more
students will be added to the
committee, and it will stand at 22

people. Shepard added that an
open hearing specifically for
students may be held next
Tuesday afternoon.

“The hearing is for the primary
purpose of trying to get student
concerns. It is not meant to be
any sort of grievance session. It is
specifically for ideas on what the
university needs in its next
president,” she said.

Another way students can
express their feelings about what
they would like to see in the
university’s next president is an
upcoming questionnaire that will
be published in The Pitt News,
said Shepard.

The SGB also discussed a
recommendation to permit
overnight guests of the opposite
sex during the week in university
housing.

Flappers, hippies prove bot costu

By Jennifer Swoboda

For the Pitt News

In and around the Oakland
area there are a number of places
Students can put together a
creative Halloween costume.

Lynn Tomasits, the manager of
Avalon, a vintage clothing store
on Atwood Street, said some of
the most popular costumes this
year seem to be ﬂappers and
French maids. Many students
come in looking for hippie
costumes, she said.

According to Tomasits, the
French maids and ﬂapper
costumes run about $25 to $30. A
hippie costume, including
clothing, jewelry, and sun glasses,
is about $35.

T omasits said anyone can put
together a costume from between
$10 to $85 depending on what
they want to be. Avalon also sells
makeup and shoes.

Forbes Home and Hardware
on Forbes Avenue sells fabric
pieces and make up for costumes.
The store also sells masks,
novelties and Halloween party
supplies. Dolores Repic, the
manager, said everything tends
to sell quickly.

Repic said an average costume
can be put together there for
between $8 or $10. Repic said
next year she plans to order even
more supplies forithe Halloween
season.  »

Don Bradley, a Pitt student,
said he bought his cl own costume
last yeariat Avalon for about $20.

His make up and wig cost him
about $18. This year Bradley
bought his make up at Forbes
Hardware since he said it cost
him only $1.29.

Bradley said, “Forbes in less
expensive than Avalon, but the
good thing about Avalon is that
once you purchase your costume
it’s yours to keep.”

Another vintage clothing store
called Yesterday’s News on E.
Carson St. in the South Side Sells
individual pieces of clothing that
people can buy to put together
their own costumes.

Shop owner Nancy Wuerthele
said since a lot of people want to
be Dick Tracy this year, double
breasted suits that nm about $45
to $50 have been selling She said
ﬂappers are also popular, but
those costumes are fairly
expensive, running about $100.
People have also been buying
sixties clothing to be hippies, she
said.

Wuerthele said the best thing
about the clothing she sells is that
it can be worn after Halloween.

People tend to buy clothing at
Yesterday’s News for everyday
use, said Wuerthele, but the
clothes can be used to piece
together a costume also.

a symbol of a new kind of
political thinking in America.

“This breakthrough has
affected young people far more
than we thought it could have.
Today, over 300 college
campuses have reported racial
incidents. We [who fought in
the original civil-rights
movement] would have never
believed that our colleges
would be the scene of racial
incidents.”

Vivian cited statistics that said
that white males under the age

males. ,

“We’re dealing with campus

when Reagan was in power,”
said Vivian. “How will they
learn? How are they going to
see the future? We need an
intelligent new leadership for
the coming period.”

Saunders said that the

and that a BYOB policy would not
prevent people from bringing in
“hard” alcohol. He said that hard
liquor can be easily disguised in
other soft drinks, and regulating
what is brought in to a party may
become an increasing problem if a
BYOB policy is established.

Spinola said that a BYOB policy
removes liability from the national
chapters of a fraternity and keeps
it on the chapter where the alcohol
is served. This reduces the cost of
insurance for national organizations
which, in turn, reduces the dues
charged to the individual chapters.

“I think that fraternities that do
not buy their alcohol with chapter
funds reduce their legal liabilities
significantly,” Spinola said. “From
a business aspect, it works,”

Spinola noted that 16 of Pitt’s 22
fraternities currently outlaw the
purchase of alcohol with chapter
funds. He added that Sigma Alpha
Epsilon will be testing a BYOB
policy next year.

Guernsey added that Pitt’s IFC
will adjust with the demands of the
times. ,

“As societies get stricter, so do
we,” she said.

Willy Wonleczfor SGB?

During election season Student Government Board
candidates must focus on a plethora of tough, pressing
issues. Now students at the University of Pittsburgh have
another serious issue to contend with: candy.

Recently a rash of candy—ped_dling SGB candidates have
forced the student government to decide whether or not
small items such as candy shoijld be termed as bribes to

__ gain votes. The elections committee voted that any small

tokens, such as candy and pens, may be handed out to
prospective voters, as long as  cost less than 50 cents
and state’ the name of the dandidate, what office the
candidate is running for and the date of the election.

At its r*rieetingf'Thujrsday hfight, however, the 

oV,€rruled that decision and stated that candidates rnaynot
hand out candy and other tokens as bribes. A S

Later. judicial- committee chairperson Alan Rosenthal
ruled that this vote by theSGB—-was null and void because
board member Michael Cohen is a candidate for SGB
president, and therefore could not vote on the subject
because of his vested personal interest. ‘ '

Pitt students should have the right to decide whether or
not they want to be bribed. Furthermore, students who
don’t eat very often may actually want to take this candy,
regardless of who gave them their evening meal. ,

We believe that some forms of candy should be allowed
to be usedas vote-getters. The Pitt News will endorse, for
example, any SGB candidate willing to give chocolate to
students as gimmicks, as it can serve as a temporary meal.

On the other hand, hard candy and gum should not be
allowed because the flavor “lasts an extra long time,” and
therefore, students taking this will have an unfair advantage
come Nov. 7.

According to SGB member Bob Batchelor, there is “a
certain respect and dignity associated with the SGB
election.” The Pitt News sincerely hopes that Pitt students
will be able to keep this in mind as they munch on
officially unendorsed SGB candy. I

Shepard should resign as Well

It is a travesty, to the student body as a whole,
that a much more affirmative action was not taken
on the Student Government Board’s, and especially
Julie Shepard’s part, to insist we as students have
more representation on the presidential—search
corwrnrttee. ,

The appointment of Lisa Campoli to the committee
is yet another example of Ms. Shepard’s’ abuse of

» her position — mainly not effectively representing

“the student body as a whole, . .  ,
As president of the SGB, Ms. Shepard should

H I A have ‘immediately objected toor at least questioned

Li gons appropriately wrote in*his"letters, her excuse

on her part is completely - I

reorganize the gifted program in the Pittsburgh

public schools. Lisa, spearheading the effort,

organized a meeting in which she mediated a

discussion of ideas and consolidated them into a

concise and written form to be submitted. In the

discussion she artfully handled a diversity of opinions
and gracefully allowed all opinions to be fully
expressed. Clearly, Lisa is extremely capable of
working with a diverse group.

The Pitt News has suggested that Lisa is "‘not
familiar with the workings’ of the university” because
she is only a sophomore.‘Lisa'is currently serving
as the chair of the governmental-relations committee
of the Student Government ' Board. She was
appointed to this position last year after undergoing
a rigorous process of application and interview.
Currently, she and her committee are working for
' the reauthorization of the Higher

inexcusable as president of
Student Government Board. (All
members of the board should

question her abilities, not just
one member.) .
It is obvious Ms. Shepard is not capable of her
position in the student government. No effective
president would ever make such a crucial
appointment without consulting major student
groups and the majority student opinion as expressed
through student representatives. Mr. Ligons deserves
a thanks for effectively objecting to Julie Shepard’s
decisions and voicing the opinion of the [Black
Action Society]. Where are other members of the
SGB? More students should object to such outwardly
undemocratic leadership. Julie Shepard was elected
by students and as such is accountable to students.
If she cannot lead correctly, then she should be
ousted and replaced with someone who can.

Campoli excellent choice
The pages of The Pitt News are supposedly a
forum through which members of Pitt’s diverse
undergraduate population can express their views.
However, we believe that the editorial staff of The
Pitt News has not adequately represented these
views in the past several weeks. While they have
certainly demonstrated the existence of a faction
which opposes Julie Shepard’s appointment of Lisa
Campoli to the presidential—search committee, they
have barely acknowledged the merits of this
selection. We are writing to express our full support
for Lisa Campoli as the undergraduate student
representative on the presidential—search committee.
Our experience with Lisa’s participation and
performance in her various student roles has been
one of unqualified excellence. Recently, our
organization has been contributing to efforts to

and Pell Grants for
undergraduates. It seems, then,
that Lisa must necessarily possess a certain

. understanding of the “workings” of the university

and related issues in order to properly execute her
job as chairperson of GRC. ‘

The articles in The Pitt News concerning Lisa’s
appointment frequently allude to her supposed
lack of experience and question her qualifications.
However, a simple analysis of Lisa’s superior
attainment over the past two years reveals that Lisa
does in fact possess many and diverse qualifications
which have unfortunately been ignored in the
publicity surrounding her appointment. Instead,
the editorial staff of The Pitt News has elected to ﬁll
its pages with petty personal attacks on Julie
Shepard and Lisa Campoli.

The editorial staff of The Pitt News has a
responsibility to its readership to cover the story of
the presidential search in full. Thus far, this has not
happened. The coverage of Lisa’s appointment and
the commencement of the presidential search has
been deficient from the outset, as only the views of
an exclusive group of students have appeared in
any of the multitude of feature articles concerning
this subject. We hope that this letter will enlighten
the readers of The Pitt News who have been
subjected to a one-sided perspective on the
presidential search.

In conclusion, we extend our congratulations
and full support to Lisa Campoli and the presidential-
search committee.

Luck of the Irish...

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

Pitt Coach Paul Hackett
received some questioning as to
why he elected to kick a point-

. after attempt instead of trying for

a two—point conversion with his
Panthers down 31-21 with 33
seconds to go against the Irish
Saturday night.

Obviously, some reporters
were playing the role of the
eternal optimist, figuring that Pitt
may have converted for two,
been down by eight and fielded

~the ensuing onsides kick,

eventually winding up in the
end zone with a bomb to tie the
game. All of this with less than
half a minute to go, with only
Notre Dame’s defense standing
between the Panthers and a
touchdown. So why not try it?

“With 35 seconds left when
you’re nine points behind, it
doesn’t make any difference,”
Hackett said. In response to
repeated pressure as to why he
did not elect to try the
aforementioned situation,
Hackett said in frustration, “Well,
I didn’t think that through."

Pitt did not recover the onsides
kick anyway. ,

No matter, the Panthers put

‘K forth one of their best efforts of

the season in a 31-22 loss to the
Irish in front of a sold-out crowd
and a national-television
audience.

Alex Van Pelt set a new school
record for completions and tied
a record for passes thrown, going

. 37-51 with two touchdowns and

two interceptions. The previous
records were held by John
Congerni, who completed 31
against Ohio State in 1984, and
Dave Havern and Rick T rocano,
who attempted 51 passes in 1968
and 1978, respectively.

Darnell Dickerson had his

finest day receiving, pulling down
nine passes for 87 yards, including
a spectacular 8—yard touchdown
catch with 39 seconds left in the
game.

Despite some late-breaking
heroics by Raghib Ismail,
including a 76-yard touchdown
run midway through the fourth
quarter, Pitt held the “Rocket” to
zero yards rushing on two carries
and 8 yards receiving through the
first half. In fact, take away the
touchdown run and another 18-
yarder in the fourth quarter, Ismail
had 22 yards on eight carries. A
sub-par night. But his big-play
ability is why many call him the
best college football player in the
country.

Midway through the first quarter
Pitt tailback ‘Kevin Williams gave

up the ball on a fumble at the

Panther 17-yard line. The miscue
gave rise to Notre Dame’s first
touchdown, a 2-yard run by Tony
Brooks.

Brooks hit pay dirt again in the
second quarter on a 28-yard run
through the middle to give the
Irish a 14-0 lead. V A

Pitt did not counter until late in
the half, when Van Pelt hit tight
end Dave Moore on a 9-yardpass
to pull Pitt to within 7. '

Despite being down by only 7
at the half, Hackett was not
pleased.

“We fumbled the ball on the
15-yard line and gave them a
touchdown. I didn’t feel very
good at halftime,” he said. “We
had five holding penalties. We
can play with them. But we can’t
make mistakes. The issue, as l’ve
said all year, is not the opponent;
the issue is us.”

Pitt was penalized 1 1 times for
125 yards on a night when yellow
ﬂags seemed to be jumping out
of the officials’ pockets by
themselves.

Irish Coach Lou Holtz admitted

The Pitt men’s swim team raced out to

-a commanding lead, leaving the Duquesne

Dukes far back in their wake, cruising to
a 106-84 victory in the Panthers’ first meet
of the season. '

The Dukes were so over—matched by
Pitt that only one Duquesne swimmer
finished ahead of a Panther, and that was
only by a half at second. After Pitt swept
the first six events, the score was 91-21,
and the meet was conceded to Pitt. The
rest of the day was just an exhibition, but
the Panthers were not done. They
proceeded to make a clean sweep of
every event.

The 400-meter medley team of James
Austin, Don Boyd, Joe Kozlina and Eric
Cornell posted a winning time of 3 minutes,
40.66 seconds to begin the onslaught.

The grueling 1,000 freestyle was next,
and junior David Schepner led Pitt to
victory with a time of 10:00.92, almost a

full minute ahead of the fastest Duquesne
swimmer. Mike Pfister and Dave Martin
finished second and third, respectively for
the Panthers.

In the 50 meters free, Kozlina captured
his second of three victories with a time of
21.77. Freshmen Dave Dodson, Zac
Economos and Tony Frassetto each saw
their first collegiate action in the event.
They finished second, third and fifth
respectively.

The Panthers travel to St. Bonaventure
on Nov. 3 for their next meet.

Women

Scheduling an easy win for a powerful
team is a common practice in modern
college athletics. Football teams do it all
the time. They schedule a team they know
they can beat to start the new season out
on the right foot. This practice appears to
have been carried over into swimming
and diving as well.

On Friday the University of Pittsburgh
women's swimming and diving squad

faced the Lady Dukes from Duquesne.
The Lady Panthers overpowered their
visitors, opening their new campaign with
a 95-82 victory.

This score is, at best, misleading. After
allowing nothing higher than one second-
place finish and only 16 points through
the first six races, the meet went to an
exhibition format. Up to that point the Pitt
swimmers had amassed 95 points. After
this, Duquesne was given the remaining
points, accounting for the closeness of the
score.

Despite blowing the competition out of
the water, Coach David Belowich was
concerned with other elements besides
the score. “The score did not reflect what
we are about. We stayed aggressive
throughout the meet, and we were even
strong on our off events, and that’s good
to see.”

The Lady Panthers, hoping to defend
last year’s Big East championship,
overwhelmed its opponent with a
combination of seasoned, veteran talent

en season with easy victories over Duquesne,

and young, rookie enthusiasm. Three
freshman swimmers impressed Coach
Belowich with their performance in their
first collegiate meet. “Candie Burke was
really strong in the 200-yard individual
medley-, Margaret McClurg looked really
good in her events, and Jennifer Burns
also did a nice job in the events she
competed in, also,” said Coach Belowich.

Belowich emphasized, however, that
this team’s success depends mainly on the
role that his experienced swimmers play.
“The seniors and juniors showed
tremendous leadership today. That will
make a difference this year. The better
they lead, the better we will be," said
Belowich.

“This meet served as a tune-up for us.
We travel to Syracuse this coming weekend
for a tough meet with Syracuse and St.
John’s, so we will find out how good we
are then,” said Belowich.

The Lady Swimmers travel to St.
Bonaventure, N.Y. on Nov. 3, for a meet
with the St. Bonaventure Lady Bonnies.

Baltimore Blast to cballengefor top spot in MSL East

Editor's Note: The following is the
first of a two-part series.

In a league that proclaims itself
"human pinball” and has seen 22
defunct teams in 13 years
(including the Pittsburgh Spirit),
an inﬂux of foreign players (ever
hear of Slobodan Illijevski?) and
a recent name change (from the
MISL to the MSL —— Major Soccer
League), it appears anything is
possible. I

The only constant in the MSL
has been the dominance of the
San Diego Sockers, which has
won six league titles and boasted
a slew of all-stars. '

This , year, however, the

Baltimore Blast appears ready
to challenge for the title.

The Blast (32-20, lost to San
Diego in the title game) has the
MSL’s best defense, led by all-
stars Bruce Savage and
goalkeeper Scott Manning.

The acquisition of former
Kansas City Comet forward Dale
Mitchell gives the Blast a long-
needed big gun up front. Throw
in midﬁelder Tim Wittrnan,
arguably the finest indoor
American player, and the Blast is
a solid team that should win the
Eastern Division easily. The only
problem will be the team’s
tendency to choke in the big

to a 26-26 record. The Wings do
have a fine 1-2 punch in Dale

veteran David Byrne had a career
year, but the lack of a solid,
experienced goalkeeper is the
big problem. The Wings imported
Ron Fearon from Ipswich of

England last year, and he -.

responded with a mediocre 3.86

improves and Ervine doesn’t

higher than fourth. But on a team

several times to cutting it even
closer. But that run broke the
Panthers back. The ﬁnal score
stood at 31-22, but only a late
touchdown pass to Darnell
Dickerson made it close.

Ismail ended with 214 total
ﬁnds — 1 10 of them in the fourth
quarter. The 76-yard run was his
career longest as was his 116
rushing yards on 10 carries.

But through three quarters it
looked as if the Panthers would
actually hold Ismail in check.

“This was an average day for
[Ismail]. That’s not an

Qraggeration,” said Notre Dame
Coach Lou Holtz. “Ask anybody
who watches this team on a
regular basis; tl1ey’ll tell you that.”

In fact, compared to his
previous week’s performances, it
was a below-average day. Ismail
has 705 yards in his last three
games and 482 in his last two, so
his 214 yards actually brought

ﬂown his average.

Although the 76-yard run was
Ismail’s only touchdown, he could
have had another. He broke
through again later in the fourth
quarter from the Pitt 36, but ran
into the referee. He regained his
balance, but not before Panther
defenders were in striking
distance, and they dragged him

jlQWI’1 after an 18-yard run.

After the game, reporters from
all over the country swamped the
Irish locker room, stepping on
towels, shoes, bags and pads in
search of Ismail. 6

After 15 minutes the showers ,
were empty, but still no sign of I
Ismail. Then a reporter spotted 1

him. Tucked away in a dark corner
by an exit in the middle of the

Sbcker room, Ismail hurriedly
dressed himself, trying to avoid
the weekly crush of the media
that follows him.

Once he was spotted, however,
it was all over. Microphones, tape
recorders and notebooks
jockeyed for position, hanging
under his breath to record his
few mutterings.

It started last year and has

ﬁicked up again this year. A media
barrage that has turned Ismail’s
life upside down and brought
Ismail’s family into the national
spotlight. It has turned his brother
from just another reserve wide
receiver at Syracuse into “The
Missile” and even given his mother
a nickname —— “The Launching
Pad.”

‘K Ismail tries to avoid it all,
however, and hides from the press
as _much as possible. The name

attempt at anonymity. But it didn’t
work.

Donning a Pittsburgh Steelers
baseball cap with his nickname

answered questions for a couple

dressing in the corner.

Suddenly, without a word more,
he straightened his tie, adjusted
his hat and was gone out the

Lady Pcmtber volleyball ‘sweeps Notre Dame

By Ryan Buncher
Sta_[f'W1-iter -

The Pitt volleyball team won its fifth
straight match Saturday afternoon and raised
its record to 22-4 (6-0 in the Big East) by
defeating Notre Dame (7-16) in three games
by scores of 15-6, 15-9, 15-7.

The team played in front of 100 fans —
a large crowd compared to the usual turnout
for its home matches. Senior co-captain

Michele Adamson (seven kills, .636 kill
percentage) said of the crowd, “It helps.
Hearing the fans’ cheering is good, and
when they single you out and congratulate
you, you get excited. It helps the play on
the court."

In the first game the Lady Panthers fell
behind 4-1 before running off seven straight
points, aided by the communication
problems of Notre Dame. Service errors
also plagued the Irish, who had 13 compared

to only five for Pitt.

The Lady Panthers also came from behind
in the second game. They were down 9-6,
but scored the last nine points of the game.
They also won the third game by scoring
the final nine points.

Pitt outdug the Irish 53 to 31, led by 12

 go along with 10 digs and a .500

I percentage was .317, compared

percentage. Pitt’s kill
to only .158 for Notre Dame.

Pitt also beat the Southern
Illinois Salukis on Friday by scores
of 14-16, 15-8, 15-11, 15'10. The
Lady Panthers were erratic, with
the Salukis running off a string of
points every time Pitt seemed to
take control. After losing the first
game, Pitt won the second, mostly
due to streaks of eight and five
points. The key point might have
been in game three. A run of
eight unanswered Pitt points,
featuring some great shots by
Zonneville and Linda Zols, got
the crowd into the match.

Pitt scored the last seven points
of the match when it was down
10-8 in the fourth game.

said.

“We played hard, and we won.
I don't think it’s fair at all to Pitt to
say that we played a bad football
game,” he added.

A Craig Hentrich field goal was
the only scoring action in the
third quarter, but Ismail’s 76-yard
touchdown, the longest of his
career, put the Irish up 24-7.
Glenn Deveaux capped a seven—
play, 80-yard drive on Pitt’s
ensuing possession, but ND
quarterback Rick Mirer countered
with a one—yard run with 3:07
remaining in the game to give the
Irish a 16-point lead.
