The new world of computers
is knocking at the nation’s door,
and a dean from the University
of Pittsburgh will be part of this
process by assisting President
Bill Clinton’s administration.

Toni Carbo Bearman, dean of
the School of Library and
Information Science (one of the

biggest in the country) was
recently appointed to a 27-
member council that will create
the National Information
Infrastructure (NH). The com-
mittee will advise the president
on policies for the country’s
information superhighway.
Bearman, who is the only
university official on the coun-
cil, said she was very surprised
that she had been chosen. She

will serve along with other rep-
resentatives from companies
such as AT&T and MCI, and a
senator from Hawaii.

The council is not only made
up of representatives from big
companies. It encompasses
people from the private sector
such as a Virginia elementary
school teacher and a represen-
tative from National Public

-Radio. According to Bearrnan,

the purpose is “to make sure all

She said the purpose of this

tem is to give people more
access to an abundance of
information in the future.

The council will advise the
Clinton Administration on such
issues as: Who should get

Byllye Avery started working toward
improved health care for women in 1973.

“I was involved with the wornan’s
health movement which was mostly the
white woman’s health movement,” said
Avery, founding president of the National
Black Women’s Health Project. “I asked
myself, what is the difference between
black women’s health issues and white
women’s health issues?”

To answer this question, Avery
explained that the key issue surrounding
health care is mental health, which was a
problem for many black women. She said
that during the 705 she was struck by a
study which showed that young black
women felt moe psychological distress in
their lives than did white women of the
same age group.

“I couldn’t figure it out. I know we
aren’t crazy. What is this distress?” she
said.

To figure out this problem, and other
health care problems, Avery usually
takes a non—traditional approach.

According to Dr. Donald Mattison, dean
of Pitt’s Graduate School of Public Health
(which sponsored Avery’s lecture), one
unique thing about Avery is that she has
won the McArthur Foundation Fellowship
award.

"They call it the McArthur genius
award. Very few people get it. It’s for
extremely creative approaches,” he said.

In 1973, Avery was working in a med-
ical center for children when someone
asked her to give a lecture about abor-
tion. This was when she started thinking
about feminism.

“The first person that told me about
feminism was a white man, so you never
know where your lessons are going to

one-fourth of the U.S. pop-
ulation, the Holocaust did
not happen, concentration
camps were a hoax and
death camps did not exist
during World War 11.

When asked by a 1993
poll to determine the
extent of Americans’
knowledge of the
Holocaust, 22 percent of
American adults and 20
percent of American high
school students said “Yes,
it was possible that the
Holocaust did not hap-
pen,” according to
Deborah Lipstadt, associ-
ate professor of Modern
Jewish and Holocaust
Studies at Emory
University.

Lipstadt, a noted educa-
tor and author, spoke yes-
terday afternoon on denial
of the Holocaust. She has
recently completed a full-
length study on the history
of those who attempt to
deny the occurrence of the
Holocaust.

“The response that so
many people answered
‘yes’ to the impossibility of
the Holocaust shocked
many people who had
long dismissed denial as a
wacky phenomenon,”
Lipstadt said.

Lipstadt quoted Winston
Churchill: “One cannot
today even reconstruct the
state of mind that would
render such gestures
impossible.”

She said she thinks this
quote could apply to those
who are trying to mini-
mize the Holocaust.

Democratic gubernatorial candidate campaigns at Pitt

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer

Wearing blue jeans, a sweatshirt and sneakers, 53-
year—old gubernatorial candidate Chuck Volpe talked to
the University Democrats last night about why he wants
to offer Pennsylvania voters a better choice.

“I’m a candidate that has actually worked for a living,
that has made a payroll, that has provided jobs to other
people besides myself,” he said.

The Pittsburgh attorney, who runs an insurance busi-
ness with branches statewide, said that the people who
ran in the last govemor’s election “never had a real

job.”

“These people were on state payroll with free cars 
mostly Lincoln Continentals, and they had better health
care, with unlimited vision and unlimited dental costing
taxpayers about 88,000 per bureaucrat,” he said.

Volpe told the group how he has traveled around the
state for the past two years talking and listening to dif-
ferent groups of people.

“I’ve developed a rapport with the people I’ve talked
to, mainly because they looked at me like I wasn’t~‘a
politician,” he said, “because they understand and rec-
ognize someone who’s sincere.”

Volpe said most of the people he had talked to have

one of two opinions about government.

“One is the ‘Us against Them’ mentality,” he said.
“They know they’re going to get screwed [by politi-
ciansl, but they don’t know how. The second thing ‘is
that they believe they can’t make a difference. ‘We’re
small fish,’ they say. ‘Do we matter in the process?”

“I’m here to represent those 12 million
Pennsylvanians who have no say and have no shot.”

Because he said he wants to earn the respect of vot-
ers and does not want to be influenced by any special
interest group. Volpe will not accept any political action
committee contributions to his campaign.

Rescuers express emotions and
eXperiences with Students for Life

By Randy Knapick
Staff Writer

Dozens of protesters gather

' on the stairs and sidewalk in

front of an abortion clinic in
Hobbs Ferry, New York. Some
carry Crucifixes or signs con-
demning abortion, sing and
pray aloud. Others sit in com-
plete silence.

A dissenting pro-choice pro-
testor, carrying a “Keep
Abortion Legal” sign, pickets in
front of the pro-life blockade.
Other pro-choice activists
become involved in heated Ver-
bal exchanges with the pro-life
protestors.

Soon the police mobilize,
arresting pro-life demonstrators
in front of the clinic. Other pro-
life protestors cheer as the

' police vehicle containing the

arrested protestors departs for
the police station.

Such scenes are very familiar
to pro-life “rescuers” such as
Mark and Gretchen Nelson,
who shared their experiences
with Pitt’s Students for Life yes-
terday.

Rescuing, “a very controver-
sial aspect of the pro-life move-
ment,” according to Students
for Life president Jeff Paladina,
involves protesting abortion
clinics and blockading their
entrances, rendering them inac-
cessible.

Mark Nelson has been rescu-

ing since he was a senior in
high school in 1989. His first
rescue was at an abortion clinic
on Fulton Street in Pittsburgh.

He attended the University of
Steubenville briefly before
dropping out of school to res-
cue full-time.

“By rescuing, we say that we
love you so much that we’re
going to stop you from going
in [the abortion clinicl,” Nelson
said.

Nelson said rescuers sit or lay
down in front of the abortion
c1inic’s doors “to keep the
abortion mill closed for as long
as possible.”

Nelson said rescuers do not
blockade clinics “for media

attention,” but rather to save .

individual babies’ lives. “It
brings the Gospel message a

lot closer to you,” he said.

Among the rescuers are
counselors who try to talk the
women who come tothe clinic
for abortions out of the proce-
dure. “We try to reach out to
the women on the street,”
Nelson said.

Mark Nelson was one of
seven rescuers involved in the
“tar rescue” in Pittsburgh a few
years ago, in which the protes-
tors locked their feet in buckets
of tar to hinder police attempts
at removing them.

The police pushed the pro-
testors over, coating the clinic
and the protestors themselves
in tar.

Nelson_said he thought the
rescue, which had lasted only
15 minutes, was a failure until

memory are virtues of the past
that demand that we wrestle with
them. We must confront the past
and take it with us.

“It is not just those who are
personally connected with this
tragedy who must confront it. All
who are repulsed by hatred and
terror must confront it. But
before there can be confronta-
tion there must be knoxxledge."

Lipstadt said the amount of
American ignorance is appalling.
Other questions on the 1995 poll
determined that 38 percent of
American adults and 52 percent‘
of high school students either did
not know or incorrectly
explained what is meant by the
Holocaust. Lipstadt not only
spoke about the deniers but also
attacked the revisors.

“It is not really the deniers who
pose the greatest stress, but
those who would rather revise.
Revisionists try to change our
sense of history. lThey make] an

attempt to rewrite the past."

According to Lipstadt, both
deniers and revisionists work
hand—in-hand to deflate the
Holocaust. Denial makes revi-
sion a morecomfortable place
and when you take the extreme
you create a more reasonable
space for others. she said.

“The danger is that if this effort
[of denial and revision] is suc-
cessful. then any history is in
danger." Lipstadt said. “The bot-
tom line is that utter nonsense
llikel theiearth is flat, two plus
two equals five, Flvis is alive 
the Holocaust did not happen,
need not be given a legitimate
voice.”

Audience member _]en Hyman
said, “I find it veiy scary that peo-
ple could deny the Holocaust.
The facts are all there and I think
that sums it up."

Audience member Nancy
Ackerman said, “I gotsome new
points of view and information I
hadn’t heard before.”

Bearman compared the
superhighway to the tele-
phone. The goal of the

telephone was that every- .

body could communicate
in an easier way with access
for everyone, and the super-
highway expands on the origi-

nal technology of the tele- T -\

phone.
The Cost for NII for the pri-

vate sector, according to a -

university press release, is
estimated at $50 billion to
$100 billion over the next 10
years. The government plans
to invest 81.2 billion each
year to further develop infor-
mation technology and for
“laying fiber optic cable.”

In her two-year term,
her input along with the other
26 members will be the source
of new legislation and guide-
lines on the information high-
way.

Bearman said the future of
the information superhighway
will have “endless opportuni-
ties and improve the quality of
life through universal informa-
tion access.”

the project. I hope that our
chancellor does the same,”
SEAC member Matt Peters said.

But according to a statement
made by Dr. David Turncheck
of Pitt’s astronomy department,
no decision on supporting the
project has even been made.

“The point is that we're in
the process of looking at
a number of telescope sites
to decide what is the best
option for the University of
Pittsburgh.

But whether Pitt joins or not
will not determine the status of
the project. The amount of
money compared to what has

486 SX/25MI-I:

already been invested is tiny,”
said T urncheck.

Josh Knauer of SEAC said
he disagrees with T urncheck’s
claim that the univer-
sity’s involvement will not
change the status of the pro-
ject.

“Tl1e«°ai1ioL1nt that Pitt would
contribute [15 million] would
be 10 percent. Furthermore,
the University of Arizona’ said
they can’t build the project
without more funds,” said
Knauer.

“As a result of National
Science Foundation and

National Optical Astronomy
Observatories studies in the
mid—’80s, some 20 North
American institutions have
abandoned their plans for a
partnership with UA on Mt.
Graham,” the coalition said.
“In 1984 one NSF study found
38 better sites than Mt. Graham
in the continental U.S. Another
study published in 1987 by
the NOAO and representing
years of careful measurements
determined that Mauna Kea

.was clearly superior to Mt.

Graham. Problems with Mt.
Graham included optical distor-
tion from turbulent air pat-
terns.”

“I absolutely agree that
there are better sites,”
Turncheck said. “But you have
to be practical — Hawaii and
Chile would be more expen-
sive.”

According to Knauer, howev-
er, “The Smithsonian Institute
chose Hawaii because of tech-
nological problems and envi-
ronmental issues — it had
nothing to do with monetary
consideration.”

Turncheck said that environ-
mental issues shouldn’t even
be a concern.

‘There is no threat
to the environment. The obser-
vatory, in fact, will kind of
put up a protective shield.
Scientists have to wonder
if environmental activists
have some kind of an ul-
terior motive, like building
ski slopes,” said Turncheck.

“That kind of malicious
slander doesn’t even deserve a
response,” said Knauer.

Continued from page 1
come from,” she said.

Her talk on abortion eventu-
ally led to her to establish the
Gainesville Woman’s Health
Center in Florida where she was
born. The center focused on
women in a new way.

“We were women from our
head to our feet,” she said.
Health care for women should
not just be about pregnancy,
abortion and breast cancer, and
it should “give equal weight to
all of what’s in us.”

Avery said health care goes
beyond getting medical treat-
ment when something is
wrong. People need to learn
how to take care of themselves,
physically and mentally.

“We had to learn to take care
of ourselves. They never taught
us that,” she said.

According to Avery, children
need to be taught about sex,
and one of the problems today
is that society places a taboo on
sex.

“When in coming to the sub-
ject of sex, we ﬂunk out as a
society. I don’t believe in calling
a little boy’s, penis a dill pickle
and a little girl’s vagina a pock-
etbook. Learn to say the
words,” she said.

This can be difficult to do,
something Avery found out
with her own daughter.
Although Avery did not want to
encourage her daughter to
become sexually active at a
young age, she stressed how
important it was to be open
with children.

Another ‘difference Avery
noticed between black women
and white women was their clif-
fering responses to abortion.

Although proportionately black .

women have more abortions
than white women, black
women do not feel that they
have a choice, they do not feel
empowerment, she said.

Empowerment is essential for
good health, she said, and black
women often feel hopelessness,
alienation, isolation and power-
lessness instead.

“We are always in motion
doing something for somebody
else, and very few people are in
motion doing something for
us.”

Avery said that for black
women to empower them-
selves, they need to talk to each
other and get to know them-
selves. At the women’s center
Avery started self-help groups
in which women talked about
Certain things, often for the first
time, with other people. One
issue that \came up. repeatedly
was violence.

“Breaking the conspiracy of

silence” leads to empowerment,‘

said Avery. “We want to get rid
of it, but we’re just scared.”

“When we tooklour shoes off
and talked about it, we had a
better perception of ourselves
as black women,” she said.

In 1978, Avery and other
health care activists founded
Birth Place, a facility that pro-
vided alternative methods of
giving birth. The theory behind
this center was also empower-
ment.

“Women weighed themselves
when they came. They had
complete access to their med-
ical records. I can’t think of any-
one who deserves to see my
medical records more than me.
I need to know,” she said. The
women could also choose the
position in which they would

give birth. Avery explained that
this participation gave the
women empowerment and
improved health care.

The women at Birth Place
were not the only ones who
participated in the pregnancy.
The fathers and children were
also encouraged to help.

“It’s a wonderful time for
empowerment for women, men
and children,” she said.
“Children don’t have to ask
where babies come from, they
were there.”

Myrna Silverman, associate
professor of in the Department
of Health Services at GSPH,
chaired the committee which
chose to bring Avery to Pitt.

“We wanted someone who
would relate to the community
.. we specifically worked with
the Afro-American community
to decide what time the lecture
would be. I think it went very
well, especially considering the
weather,” Silverman said.

“I thought it was a great lec-
ture that brought about relevant
issues not traditionally brought
up, specifically that communi-
cation is the key,” said Harry
Marshall, a research fellow. from
the University of Pittsburgh’s
Department of Surgery.

Joyce Reese expected to
enjoy the lecture and was not

disappointed. “I think she was

everything I expected and
more. She was a very inspiring
speaker,” she said.

At the end of the lecture,
which was part of
the University of Pitts-
burgh Chancellor’s Lecture
Series, Avery encouraged
women to volunteer for the
National Black Woman’s Health
Project.

he learned a woman had decid-
ed against abortion as a result
of the protest. ,

As a result of the tar rescue,
Mark Nelson received a one-
year jail sentence. Neither Mark
nor his wife, Gretchen, are
strangers to jail sentences
resulting from rescues.

Mark and Gretchen Nelson
went to jail with five others for
a rescue in Allentown only two
weeks after the couple’s wed-

ding, and they were separated
for months. They were allowed
to see each other only once
during the jail sentences, for
about 20 minutes on Christmas
Eve.

Gretchen Nelson, who also
dropped out of school to res-

“I wish I could say that I had all this extra money laying
around, but I don’t,” Volpe said. “Sacriﬁces will have to be
made with my family, but I know my children will under-
stand it was important.”

Volpe said he would support a bill making it illegal for
political action groups to contribute to a candidate’s cam-
paign.

“It’s bribery,” he said. “We can’t get a bill out of committee
without 50 special interest groups grabbing itlland changing
itl.”

“It:,’s got to the point where you can’t live the American
Dre?1m,” Volpe said, “\Where you can’t break into govern-
ment because incumbents have built up such a war chest
from special interest groups.”

Volpe acknowledged he is the youngest person to ever run
for governor of Pennsylvania, but claims his “wrinkles are on
the inside,” and that Bill Clinton was two years younger than
he when elected governor of Arkansas.

Although Volpe has held no political office, he said that is
one of his greatest strengths.

“I have no experience in running up a $3 billion tax hike,”

he said. “I’m not used to raising people’s taxes. I’m used to
managing a payroll.”

What Volpe does plan to do in office is provide a “job
voucher,” which would require all businesses to sign an affi-
davit pledging to provide a certain number of jobs that
would match the tax cut they would receive.

signiﬁcance, he said, because if the pro-
testors cooperated by walking away,
they would appear to be giving up their

cause.

Several years ago, penalties for rescu-
ing were more lenient than they are
today, usually consisting of a fine of
about 5350, according to Gretchen
Nelson.

Protestors never paid these fines, she
said, because they “hadn’t done anything
wrong.”

Current penalties involve stiffer penal-
ties, especially after the first offense.
Mark Nelson said the stiffer penalties are
the result of attemp_ts “to stop rescue.”

“When they start coming down on you
like that, you know you’re effective,” he
said.

These sentences “give worth” to abort-
ed fetuses, Gretchen Nelson said,

because “a baby is worth one year’s jail
time.”

Pro-choice activists who counter
the pro—life blockades generally are
not arrested unless they threaten the
police or use violence, because they
cannot be charged with trespassing
violations like the pro—life protestors, she
said.

“Pro-choicers are scary,” Mark Nelson
said. “They obviously don’t care for God
and don’t respect life at all.”

Gretchen Nelson sees the jail time as a
trade—off, sacrificing her time and free-
dom for the life of a baby.

“The philosophy behind rescue is that
you’re breaking a trespass law for a
higher good,” she said.

She used an analogy with a child
drowning in a neighbor’s swimming
pool. “Nobody would charge you with
trespassing if you jumped over a fence

to save the child’s life,” she said. “It’s the
right thing to do.”

Mark and Gretchen Nelson sympathize
with the police officers who arrest pro-
testors involved in rescues. “They’re in a
tough position,” he said.

“We try not to pick a fight with the
cops,” he said.

Sometimes, police officers admit they
do not like arresting protestors because
they are Christians too, according to
Mark Nelson.

“If your father worked for a company
for 20 years, you can’t expect him to just
quit his job,” he said.

According to the rescuers, however,
in I one instance a police officer
who refused to make an arrest left
his motorcycle and sat down with
the protestors. The officer was ar-
rested along with the other protest-
ors.

“Say a small business got a 2
to 3 percent tax cut,” Volpe
said. “That would mean two
jobs at $25,000 a year. In a big
business, it could mean hun-
dreds of jobs.”

“If I had a choice between
paying taxes and hiring some-
one, I’d hire someone, because
that’s one more person promot-
ing your product,” he said.

The state government would
not lose money with the tax
cuts, because the newly
employed people would be
coming off unemployment,
according to Volpe.

“We wouldn’t be paying for
food stamps and welfare,
because they’re off the rolls and
paying income taxes  and
spending more because they
have more.”

”Hoods ” aren ’t the problem

With the growing number of guns on the street, ris-
ing murder- and crime rates and increasing incidents
of youth violence, Pittsburgh Public Schools has come
up with a solution to decrease gang violence. No more
hoods.

No, not the ‘50s term for juvenile delinquent, but
rather the cotton—polyester blend attached to the necks
of sweatshirts.

First Pittsburgh residents were abuzz about what
color bandanas teenagers were wea.ring, but now the
emphasis has switched to hooded versus non—hooded
sweatshirts.

Parents of Lemington Elementary students were told
if their child arrived at school with a hooded sweat-
shirt, they would immediately be sent home. The,_poli—
cy goes so far as to include the preschoolers in the dis-
trict’s HeadStart program.

A school spokesperson told WPXI-TV News that in
bad weather hooded sweatshirts could.be worn to
school, but once inside, the hoods must come off all
students. Somehow it doesn’t seem feasible that three-
year—olds and elementary-school children are purpose-
ly dressing themselves in hooded sweatshirts to pro-
mote gang activity, let alone know what gangs are.
The rationale behind the school policy is more than
questionable, it seems rather to border on the absurd.

If district administrators want students to dress one
way and not another, they should simply make a stan-
dard uniform code, similar to those in parochial
schools. In doing -this, it would save parents money in
buying school clothes for their children as well as sat-
isfy school officials in their aim to provide atmosphere
free from gang imagery.

Rather than spending time worrying about what stu-
dents are wearing and developing policies to specify
what is and is not acceptable, the schools should be
formulating plans to improve the academicand social
atmospheres in constructive, effective manners.
Providing more after— school sponsored activities and
encouraging children to become involved in athletics
and extra-curricular activities will keep children off the
streets, at least a few more hours of the day, and will
teach them the value’ of teamwork and perseverance
as well.

Funding is tight in most public school systems, but
finding ways to keep children away from street vio-
lence and gang activity at an early age will only save
money in the future.

Instead of waiting for the debate to focus on what
type of jeans kids are wearing, school officials should
step back for a moment and think of activities that
enhance a child’s education. By doing this, they’ve
automatically taken a step against gang violence and a
step towards providing the enriching atmosphere
they’re trying to achieve now.

Investigation” of Clinton needed

Ever since I first heard about
the mysterious events surround-
ing Vince Foster’s suicide this
summer, I’ve been following
this complicated (and well hid-
den) story. After three months
of searching for the issue,
which was buried in such
papers as—the Post—Gazette and
The Washington Post, I’ve put it
together. If you’re anything like

the rest of America, you’re

probably confused about this
story. Well, the story is as sim-
ple as Arkansas and as compli-
cated to understand as liberal
logic.

Vince Foster, the former asso-
ciate of Hillary Clinton at the
Rose law firm, followed the
Clintons to Washington as
Deputy White House Counsel.
After accepting the post, Foster
committed suicide on July 20.
According to investigative
reporter David Lee Miller, in an
interview with James McDougal
for the syndicated A Current
Aﬂatr, the FBI found a suicide
note left behind which stated,
“The public will never believe
in the innocence of the Clintons
and their loyal staff.”

Within three hours, White
House aides secretly had
searched Foster’s office. It was
later revealed that the aides had
taken private papers, including
files concerning a Clinton
investment in the White Water
Development Corporation.
According to the Post-Gazette,
the files were turned over to
the Clinton’s private counsel
David Kendell.

Why take such steps so soon
after a close friend’s death?
Clinton’s partner in White
Water was James McDougal. In
1982, he purchased Madison
Guaranty Savings and Loans. By
1985, the S&L was in financial
difficulty after making several
bad loans. That same year,
McDougal helped the Clintons
pay off a $50,000 personal debt,
which was tied to the ‘84
Arkansas governor’s campaign.
The fact that Clinton borrowed

the money from the Bank of
Cherry Valley (which was
owned and run by a senior
aide to the Governor) meant
that the debt was personal and
indicates that it was a bigger
favor than first thought. This
also brings up THE FIRST
question: Were funds diverted
from a failing S&L in order to

help Clinton with his re-elec-
tion bid?

There’s still more! Beverly
Schaffer, former Madison S&L

   
    

 

By the Book
lawyer, was then appointed by
Clinton to regulate Arkansas
banks. Schaffer allowed
Madison to continue for five
years despite numerous viola-
tions detected by federal regu-
lators.

On top that, former Arkansas
judge, David Hale, who admin-
istered Small Business
Administration loans, and who
has now been indicted for
defrauding the federal govern-
ment, claims that Clinton asked
that he approve a $300,000 loan
to McDougal’s wife. Susan
McDougal, according to the
Dec. 29 business section of the
AP, was charged with writing
$140,000 in bad checks (her
hearing will be on Feb. 10). By
1989, Madison had collapsed,
and federal banking officials
soon closed it down. The fed-
eral lawsuit which followed
saw Madison only pay a mini-
mum fee, while leaving taxpay-
ers with a bill in excess of $64
million, according to the Dec.
15 edition of the Post-Gazette.
Now, who volunteered to pros-
ecute Madison? The Rose law
firm, who was lead by (you
guessed it) Hillary Rodham

Clinton. Mrs. Clinton is current-

ly under FDIC investigation for

her involvement. However,
James McDougal was charged
and acquitted of banking fraud.
All of this brings up THE SEC-
OND question: Did McDougal
use depositor money, money
we as taxpayers had to pay
back, to repay Clinton’s person-
al debts in exchange for special
treatment by state regulators?

Many are now asking THE
BIG question: Did Clinton try to
cover this up by taking the
files?

Within three hours of the
death, Clinton had aides search
his office for files he held on
to, directly interfering with the
investigation. He then needed
time to “sort and copy” files,
after promising to turn them
over. On Dec. 23, his personal
lawyer, David Kendell, request-
ed a grand-jury subpoena,
which would make the files off-
limits to everyone outside the
Justice Department. Then, you
have Janet Reno going on CNN
and, for all intents and purpos-
es, saying she’s damned if she
does, damned if she doesn’t, so
she’s going to do what’s in the
best interest of the president.
When asked to comment on
White Water, Clinton stated on
NBC Nightly News that he didn’t
see the problem because he
lost money ($69,000). However,
this so called “loss” wasn’t
claimed on his federal income
tax.

I don’t claim to know what’s
in the White Water files or
claim to know if he did some-
thing wrong or not, but clearly
no one else does either, with
the exception of the Clintons
and McDougals. What clearly
needs to be done is for an
independent prosecutor to be.
appointed by the courts, along
with congressional hearings
and not some “special prosecu-
tor” appointed by Reno. Maybe
then we’ll get the honest
answers that the American peo-
ple deserve.

The Pitt Panther wrestling team opened the
Eastern Wrestling League with a huge, come-
from-behind victory last night at the Fitzgerald
Field House over the Bald Eagles of Lock Haven.

The cold winter chill seemed to stifle the
Panther attack until senior Rich Catalano stepped
up to the mat and ignited a Panther onslaught
that saw Pitt overcome a 19-6 deficit and record
their sixth win of the season and their first win in
conference competition.

“It wasn’t real pretty but we’ll take it,” assistant
coach Jim Beichner said.

The victory last night was the Panthers second
consecutive come-from-behind victory.

Some of the scores in the early weight classes
weren’t indicative of the way the Panthers wres-
tled. Although losing by scores of 8-5, and 12-1,

Chris Stevens and Eric Knopsnyder showed some
real gusto and constantly initiated the action in
their matches. Knopsnyder fought off a near pin
in the first period just survive until the end of the
match.

Sophomore John Richey, still wrestling with a
full face mask, finally put Pitt on the board with
an 8-6 victory. Richey’s agility warmed up the
fans who braved the cold to witness the dual
meet by pulling the rnateh But in the final IU see:
onds to win and cut Lock Haven’s lead to 7-5.

Greg Budman gave it his all, but fell behind
early and was overpowered by Brian Leitzel of
Lock Haven.

Brett Gould slowed the bleeding for the
Panthers by winning a slow-paced match in the
150 lbs. division. Gould took the lead on an
escape early in the third and never relinquished
his advantage.

Maile delivered as Pitt upsets BC

By Brian Gallagher
Senior Staff Writer

Reserve guard Jason Maile drained two second-
half three-pointers and made a key defensive play
as time expired to lead Pitt past homestanding
Boston College, 77-75, in Big East conference
action last night.

Maile, who hit consecutive treys to give the
Panthers their first lead of the second half at 68-
67, stopped Golden Eagles’ guard Howard Eisley
from taking a desperation three-pointer at the
buzzer to preserve the victory.

With the road win, Pitt improves to 9-4 overall,
4-2 (second place) in Big East play. B.C. falls to
11-5 overall, 3-3 in the conference.

The Panthers have now won two straight at
Boston College, and eight of nine overall at the
Conte Forum.

“This team is a much better road team than [Pitt
teams] of the past,” Pitt head coach Paul Evans
said.

“When we execute, we can stay with just about
anybody?

Ahmad Shareef led Pitt with 14 points. The
Golden Eagles got 22 from center Billy Curley, 15
from Eisley.

Boston College led by  many as 12 points
midway through the second half (64-52) when
Pitt went on the <>ffensi\'e.

Buckets by Orlando Antigua and Eric Mobley
(11 points) cut the deficit to 64-58, and after
Maile’s big threes and a Mobley deuce, Pitt was
up, 70-68.

“I’ve felt good shooting the ball all year, but it

5 hasn’t fallen much,” Maile said. “Tonight, it finally

fell.”

The Golden Eagles caught the Panthers at 74-74
on two Eisley free throws, but would never gain
the lead again thanks to a big offensive rebound
and an ensuing pair of free throws by Pitt forward
Chris Gant (12 points) with 34 seconds remaining.

Oh. And Maile’s defensive play at the end.

“I thought he did a good job defensively, stay-
ing in front of [Eisley] when he needed to,” Pitt
head coach Paul Evans said. “He gave us some
big minutes tonight.”

Boston College led at intermission, 59-36,
thanks to a 17-2 run midway through the first half
that doused a strong early-going for the Panthers.

Pitt, employing a three—guard set from the get-
go (with Sotiris Aggelou in, Orlando Antigua out),
jumped ahead of the homestanding Golden
Eagles, 8-0, on three deuces by Shareef and a pair
of free throws by Jerry McCullough (six points).

The Golden Eagles finally got on the score-
board at the 15:27 mark on a basket by Danya
Abrams, a.nd surged to within 10-7 just two min-
utes later on rookie guard Gerrod Abram’s three-
pointer.

The Panthers countered with a “Will Call” of
their own, namely seven straight points from
Willie Cauley —- a slam dunk (off a feed from
Moblcy). a 12-foot banker, and a three-pointer —
to take a 15-7 advantage.

They sustained a comfortable five-to-seven
point lead through most of the first half — lead-

Don ’t let appearance fool you, Peny is someone to count on in water

By Sean Duncan
Staff Writer

here Chris Perry is. All 6-

foot—2 1/2 inches and 180
pounds of him. He stands like a
monument, with his rock-like
shoulders and V—shaped upper-
body, awaiting the next event
— the 200-meter individual
medley. His piercing blue eyes
look calmly upon the competi-
tion. The ceiling lights shine off
his bald scalp and glare off his
earrings —- all five of them.

Finally, the other race is over.

_Time for him to swim.

How would it feel to be
swimming in the lane next to
him? I

Just ask Penn State’s Mac
Fraser before Perry broke his
lifetime best time and easily
won the event. In the same
meet, Perry swam for his sea-
son’s best time in the 200-meter
breaststroke.

Don’t let Perry’s appearance
fool you. In fact, his appearance
is the exact opposite of his per-

sonality.

“It’s kind of for fun,” said
Perry. “If it psyches out the
opponent, I guess that’s a plus,
but I’m not a tough guy. People
know me. They know I’m not
someone to be afraid of.”

“Chris has a wild and funny
sense of humor,” swimming
captain Matt Brady said. “He’s a
down-to—ean‘.h guy and is some-
one you can count on.”

Although Perry may not
intend to psyche out his oppo-
nent, his ﬂamboyant appear-
ance does, in fact, do just that.

“If Chris Perry would stand up
next to me on the starting block
and barked a little, I would be a
little intimidated,” said head
coach Chuck Knoles.

Perry views himself much dif-
ferently than his swimming foes
do.

“I think I’m an honest and fair
person if people give me a
chance,” Perry said. “I’m friend-
ly and really care what people
think. I guess I have a good
sense of humor, too.”

Perry, a sophomore, is one of
the main reasons why Pitt’s
swimming team is ranked No.
22 in the country. His versatility
as a swimmer is why he is an
up-and-coming star. His best
events are the 200 breaststroke
and the 200 individual medley.
Perry also swims the 50-meter
butterfly, the 200-meter
freestyle, and the 400-meter i.m.

“When you talk about the
breaststroke, he’s our top man,”
said Brady. “And he’s our No. 2
man in the i.m.

“Overall, he’s a great addition
to the team.”

Other attributes Perry brings
to the swimming team are his
ability to motivate and his com-
petitiveness. Not only for his
teammates, but for himself —
which is why there are big
expectations for him in years to
come.

“Chris loves to compete,”
Knoll said. “He is an intense
competitor. He has child-like
goal expectations which allow
him to be successful.”

“He is continually improving.
He has not yet reached his full
potential, and I would guess
Chris would be able to swim
after his collegiate career is
done for the nationals.”

Don’t count on it, though.
Perry plans to major in sociolo-
gy and ultimately go into teach-
ing high—school—level kids; but
also intends to get his elemen-
tary level degree, too.

“I want to be able to teach
any age kids because I really
like kids a lot,” Perry said.

With a lot of Perry’s time
going into swimming, he should
have limited time to focus on
his school work, right?

Wrong. Perry is the consum-
mate s’t’i1dent-athlete, a member
of the dean’s list and boasts a
3.54 Q.P.A.

“I’m really proud of that fact,”
repeated Perry, “Because my
grades weren’t that good in high
school (3.0). I feel like I’m
doing a lot better in college.”

A 3.0 “not so good?” Well,
Perry must have compared his
academic success to his swim-
ming success in high school at

. Penn Manor. For a small school

in Conestoga, Pa., which is a
small town outside of Lancaster,
Perry made big splashes.

Perry was on the All-State
Team for two years, and was an
All-American as a senior.

All of this just because it was
the only sport Perry was
“decent” at.

Naturally Perry, a small town
kid, wanted to go. to a big city
for school. But that wasn’t the
only reason why he chose Pitt.

“I felt like I fit into the pro-
gram really well,” Perry said. “I
really like the coach and the
results it saw.”

It would be safe to say that
Perry has found his niche— ath—_
letically, academically and
socially.

If a Big East
Championship is linger-
ing in the minds of the
Pitt women’s basketball
team, then it is imperative
to record tonight’s contest
against 11th-ranked
Connecticut in the W—col—
umn. '

The game, which pits
two of the four Big East
co-leaders against one
another,might be the Lady
Panthers’ most important
game of the year.

“We’re still in first place
— tied for first —- but we
are in first place,” head
coach Kirk Bruce said. “A
lot of people probably
wouldn’t have given us
that amount of credit at
the beginning of the year.
We’re gonna use that as
incentive.”

Pitt (11-3, 5-1) and
Connecticut (12-2, 5-1)
are tied for first place in
the Big East Conference
with the Providence Friars
(7-6, 5-1) and the Seton
Hall Pirates (12—2, 5-1).

The Lady Huskies,
picked to win the Big East
in the preseason, are led
by 6-foot- 5-inch junior
center Rebecca Lobo.

Lobo, who has been
selected as one of 10 can-
didates for the Naismith
Female Collegiate Player
of the Year award, was
named Big East Player of
the Week last week. She
averaged 19 points and 16
rebounds in victories over
Georgetown and
Villanova.

Women's gymnastics ﬁnished third in opening meet

Rehabed Brown
forced to watch '
as Michigan takes
Blue and Gold
Cup for third

S€21SOI1.
By Neal Riley

For the Pitt News

The Pitt women’s gymnastic
team placed third last Saturday
at their first meet against West
Virginia and Michigan.

The Panthers traveled to
WVU’s Coliseum to battle for
the Blue and Gold Cup, a travel-
ing trophy which goes home
with the winning team. The tro-
phy has gone to the Michigan
Wolverineslthe last two seasons,
and they \yvon it again on

Saturday.
The final scores were:
Michigan, 187.625; WVU,

186.75 and Pitt, 160.075.
Early-season optimism aside,
Pitt was competing with two
strong opponents. Lady Panther
injuries left the team shorthand-
ed for some events, making it
difficult to achieve higher
scores. The team counted two
zeros for their vault score and
was forced to take a low score
for bars as well as for the floor.
“We’ve got lots of people out
temporarily for little things, but
it’s too early in the season to
take chances and push them,”
coach Debbie Yohman said.
The trimmed line—up left little
room for mistakes, since extra
perfomers would allow the
dropping of a low score.
Among the injured was junior
Shannon Brown, who broke her

hand in practice Friday. She had
come back from a red-shirted
rookie year due to knee surgery
to be a consistent performer on
the bars last season.

This season Brown was ready
to compete on the vault and
balance beam as well as on the
bars. Saturday was to be her
college debut on vault and
beam before the injury, which
will require surgery.

Rookie Lori Buck, who
bruised a heel recently, per-
formed only on bars (8.1) dur-
ing Saturday’s meet. She should
be back on the all-around soon.
Yohman said that this would be
a help for the beam and floor.

Meg Johns, a senior and co-
captain this year, has had some
back problems. She also had
ankle surgery last spring.
Although she has had less prac-
tice since the holidays, Johns

performed on vault, beam and
floor, scoring 9.0, 8.7 and 8.3
respectively.

According to Yohman, johns
wanted to step in on bars, but
Yohman said it was not wise for
her to push it too early.
Yohman said that Johns felt
some ankle pain on Saturday,
but her back did not give her
the usual difficulties.

Sophomore Brenda Stevens,
who is also experiencing ankle
problems, competed in the all-
around for the first time for Pitt.
Stevens had four solid perfor-
mances on Saturday, with floor
(9.2), vault (9.15), bars (9.175)
and beam (9.25).

The two other all—arounders
for Pitt at the Blue and Gold
Cup were rookie Michelle Cole
and Robyn Senior. Cole’s per-
formances were an 8.8 on ﬂoor,
9.0 on vault, 8.05 on bars and

possibilities are endless.

8.65 for ﬂoor, 9.15 on vault, 9.10
on bars and 9.10 on the beam.

Sophomore co-captain
Bethany Toellner competed on
the beam (8.95) and the floor
(9.30). Toellner has experienced
a shoulder problem and has not
worked the bars and vault much
during practice.

The Panthers host their home
opener this Saturday against
Temple University. The Lady
Panthers said they know what
they need to do to prepare for
this weekend.

Johns and Toellner could be
back in the lineup on bars, giv-
ing the team a sixth-score buffer
for that event. Toellner plans to
vault as well.

“Next week, knock on wood,
we’ll have a full lineup,”

_Yohman said. “Our vaults were

nice, but they can get better. We
"rave some vaulters that need to
step it up now and get back in
the lineup.”

Yohman said that she felt the
beams looked good but, like the
vaults, they could get better.
She also felt the team had some
real nice floor performances,
but that there were some things
that needed to be corrected.

Both Yohman and assistant
coach Ben Rovee agreed that
the bars need some work.

“We’ll be up in the 1805 soon
enough,” Yohman said.

Two third—period
power plays help
salvage sister-
kisser in State
College.

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

The Pitt Hockey Club, coming
off a month-long hiatus and
playing without their head
coach or their leading scorer,
battled to a 2-2 tie against Penn
State at State College this past
Saturday. .

The Panthers compensated
for early defensive slips with
two third period power-play
goals to tie the game and make
the long trip back to Pittsburgh
a little easier to stomach.

They did it without the help
of head coach Harold'Ochs or
first line center and leading
scorer Bill Elliott, both of whom
could not make the game.

Pitt assistant coach Mike
Messner, who played his colle-
giate hockey at Penn St., took
Ochs’ place on the Panther
bench.

“We really looked bad early
on in the game,” Hockey Club
President Matt White said. “It
just looked as if we weren’t ﬁr-
ing on all cylinders. In the third
period, though, I think we we
were able to effectively shut
them down.

“It would have been a long

» ride home had we not gotten

IILIC IILJIIIC lldkl. VV\. ilk) \J\.\.\.,1n

out of there with at least a tie.”

“For a while, it looked like we
weren’t really ready for the
game,” Panther forward Toki
Barron said.

“Right now, we really have to
cut down on stupid play.
Penalties have really killed us in
the games that we have lost.”

The man behind the mask in
the Penn Sate net stonewalled
the Panthers on chance after
chance in the first two periods
of play, giving the Lions an
opportunity to avenge an
embarrassing 12-5 loss to the
Panthers at Golden Mile Ice
Arena on Nov. 15.

While his teammates had their
work cut out for them against a

play, D’Amico was powerless to

halt the continuing onslaught. '
He was pulled with six minutes 

remaining in the second period,
with the Lions holding on to a
2-0 lead after scoring once on a
power play and once on a two-
on-none break. New Panthers’
goaltender Marvin Hodge took
over for D’Amico and held the
Lions scoreless the rest of the
way.

After a speech from Messner
in between periods, the
Panthers came out of the locker
room determined not to go
home with their first non—divi—
sional loss.

Midway through the final
period, the Panthers finally

solved the mystery between the‘

PSU pipes with defenseman
Tony Trovato, playing this game
at forward, scoring Pitt’s first
goal off the feed from captain
Vic Disanti. Defenseman Scott
Giordano was credited with the
second assist on the goal.

Shortly afterward, the
Panthers made it a new game
when Trovato set up Disanti
with the game-tying goal.
Forward Brad Rizzo got the sec-
ond assist on the goal which
made the score 2-2.

Disanti was denied a chance
for his second goal when, with
minutes remaining, he was
stoppedon a breakaway that
would have given the Panthers
their eighth win of the season.
Instead, they will have to be
content with a record of 7-3-1
when they travel to Kirk Nevin
this Saturday to battle Penn
State-West in a WPCHA Division
I showdown.

The fourth-place Panthers will
carry a 2-3 divisional record into
their game this Saturday against
the Saints, who have already
beaten Pitt earlier in the year.
That was undoubtedly the low

point of the season for the
Panthers, as they wasted two
separate one-goal leads and
gave up five power play goals
in the 9-7 loss.

The Panthers are 2-0-1 since
then, however, and are looking
to put to rest any doubts about
the strength of their team with a
convincing victory on Saturday.

“Right now, we have to stay
disciplined and make sure that
our basics are the best they can
be,” White said.

“With the depth that we have

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday,  19, 1994

the unenviable task of trying
to contain Lobo, who for the
season is averaging 18.1
points and 10.9 rebounds per
game.

“She [Lobo] is not only an
inside player, she shoots the
three—pointer,” Bruce said.
“So Carolyn Miller is going to
have to be aware of where
she is on the break and not
run under the basket [when]
Lobo is standing on top of
the key for a three- pointer.
That is the biggest adjust-
ment because you have the
biggest player on the team
and she is shooting threes on
the break. Other than that I
think they’re gonna have to
make some adjustments.”

The Lady Panthers are
coming off their worst game
of the season, a 63-52 loss to
Seton Hall at Fitzgerald Field
House on Sunday.

They think, however, that
Connecticut is vulnerable.

“If I look at game films
from last year, what I get out
of that is  they can be
pressed,” Bruce said.

In order to defeat the Lady
Huskies, Pitt is looking to
mend some of the things that
plagued it against Seton Hall.
The Lady Panthers shot only
32.7 percent from the field

Continued from page 10 and got nailed on the boards,
Pitt’s Carolyn Miller draws 45-33.

“We have to rebound well.
No second shots because
that killed us today,” forward
Jill Colabrese said. “Try and
run our break. If we avoid
giving them second shots
we’ll be able to run our
break.

"We should be able run
against them  I definitely
think we’ll have a better
shooting day. Rebounding
and better shooting is what
we need.” v

“They’re a little on the
slow side,” Bruce said.

“Size-wise they are just like
we are, but we think we
might have a little advantage
on the quickness side of
things.”

Playing a top—ranked team,
despite the fact that all three
Pitt losses have come to
ranked opponents, doesn’t
seem to bother the Lady
Panthers.

“It used to be like that
years ago, but not now
because we are a better
team,” Colabrese said.

“We split with them last
year and they’ve already
been beaten [twice] this year
so it’s not like they are
unbeatable.

“Maybe we’ll try and intim-
idate them.”

Wrestling

Continued from page’ 9

Panther losses in the next ‘two
weight classes were bitter pills
to swallow for Pitt, especially
when Derek Burgert lost his
match in sudden death over-
time, 3-1.

With only three matches
remaining, and ahead by a
score of 19-6, 22nd-ranked Lock
Haven appeared to have the
match all but sealed up.

But sometimes when things
appear to be their darkest, the
brightest stars show through.

Rich Catalano came out and
dominated Jason Rocker on the
way to his pinfall victory that
brought the Field House crowd
to its feet. _

“Rich’s win was real important
for us,” Beichner said.

Still feeling the adrenalin from
the crowd, senior Jeff Kloiber
wrestled like a man possessed,
constantly attacking his oppo-
nent en route to a 24-8 demol-
ishing of Jacob Ritchie.

With Pitt only behind 17-19,
the chips all fell into the large
hands of Panther heavyweight
Pat Wiltanger.

Wiltanger showed his mettle
by wrestling a smart, conserva-
tive match to secure his 13th
victory of the season and lock
up, pun intended, a 20-19 victo-
ry over Lock Haven. \

“Catalano came up with the
big six, and (Brett) Gould did a
really good job for us,” head
coach Rande Stottlemyer said.
“Tonight we won ugly, but we

can stand with anyone we wres-
tle.”

Over the weekend the _
Panthers split a pair of close
matches with Ohio State
University and Ohio University.

Ohio St. squeaked out an 18-
15 victory over the Panthers this
past Saturday.

Against the Buckeyes, Panther
victories were secured by
Stevens‘, Kloiber, Wiltanger and
a pin by Catalano.

Ohio University, who hosted
the meet, were victimized by
another strong Panther come-
back.

Down 19-0, the Panthers grit-
ted their teeth and started a spir-
ited comeback. They won in the
end 20-19.

Gould finally put the Panthers
on the right track with a 6-4
decision in the. 150 lbs. class.

Victories were followed by
Jason Mitchell, Rich Catalano,
Derek Burgert and Jeff Kloiber.

Trailing 17-19, Pitt called on
Wiltanger to close out the
Panther victory. Witlanger
walked the walk and delivered
a 3-2 victory to close out the
scoring.

Next up for the Panthers is
another home match at the
Fitzgerald Field House this
Saturday night at 7:30 p.m. The
Panthers face off against anoth-
er Top 25 team, the Navy
Midshipmen, in" what figures to
be anojgher tough match—up.

half. Shareef paced Pitt

long—range variety — to
