Watching Oakland

by Liz N avratil
Staﬂ Writer

Nearly a dozen officers scribbled their signa-
tures onapaperattachedto thewhine dryerase
board tucked into a corner of the Pitt police sta-
tiorr.

They enthusiastically volunteered to be part
of the Impact Overtime

William Vollberg of the Zone 4 city police, which
covers Oakland

Vollberg said that if minor incidents go un-
punished, “the behavior compounds’ ’

Delaney said this philosophy can be traced
back to former New York police department
Commissioner Lee Brown

“You take care of the

Detail, which the Pitt po-

Crime

little  said Dela-

lice now runs in conjunc-
tion with the city police, said Pitt police Chief Tim
Delaney.

Every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night,
three city police officers and one of their supervi-
sors patrol the streets of Oakland

“There’s a certain rush to it,” said Delaney.

“You’re  doing something,” said Cmdr
Francis \X/alsh, who works on the detail. “You’re
always busy,” he added, a wide smile stretching
across his face

Thedetailispartofanefforttocrackdown
on minor incidents in an effort to reduce the op-
portunities for more serious crimes, such as rapes

or shootings

Students may or may not notice a difference,

depending on how they behave

“If they’re stumblingdowndrunkorurinating A

in public, theyfre unfortunately gonna pay the price
for it; This isn’t Mardi Gras in Oakland,” said Sgt

ney, “and the big ones go
away.”

And Oakland had its share of major events
this summer:

For example, one night injune, the Pit police
responded to a ﬁght outside a hookah bar and
worked with city police to address a separate shoot-
ing outside the McDonald’s on Forbes Avenue be-
tween Atvvood Street and Oakland Avenue

Delaney said he got a phone call from city po-
lice Chief Nathan Harper following the shooting
outside McDonald’s It was then that city police
and Delaney decided to create a team to patrol
Oakland.

“Itdidn’tsutprisemebecausewehavethis type
of conversation when a big event occurs — maybe
awarprotest or abaskethall game,” said Delaney.

Pitt’s Joseph M. Katz Gradu-
ate School of Business's most
recent investment isn't on paper.
It's in the walls.

The school's $2.3 million
trading room, which opened this
summer, is a small—scale simula-
tion of \X/all Street. The class-
room allows Katz students to
analyze current and historical fi-
nancial data and use software to
build and test investment portfo-
lios.

“W/e’re bringing markets into
the classroom,” said Kuldeep
Shastri, a professor of business
administration at Katz.

The unveiling of the trading

room will take place on Oct. 3.
The board of visitors, trustees,
alumni and faculty are invited
to the demonstration, given by
Shastri and Thomas, and to the
reception following.

Classes in experiential learn-
ing‘ for both graduate and under-
graduate students began in the
laboratory Monday.‘

In the spring semester, Shastri
will teach two! classes that were
kept in mind while designing the
functionality of the trading lab.

Surrounded by a ﬂ0or—to—ceil—
ing glass wall, the 3,000—square-
foot trading lab in Mervis Hall
features stock tickers, live news
feeds and LCD screens showing
real—time prices.

The room holds 58 seats,

The multi-million dollar trading room is the newest addition to the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of

Business. The roomwas created to simulate working on Wall Street.

Technological perks

alore in new room

Katz, page 2
each seat equipped with a dual-monitor
computer station.

“Students can see the way markets are
organized and understand how prices
evolve,” said Shastri.

During a trading simulation, students
have the option to see news on one moni-
tor and the price of the stock on the oth-
er. The professor essentially controls the
price of the stock and makes announce-
ments, changing the structure of the mar-
ket. Then students must change trading
strategies based on announcements. With
one keystroke, the professor can call any
of the student screens in the class and
display them on the two large drop—down
screens at the front of the room.

Pitt is not the first schools to invest
in a trading lab. Trading rooms first ap-
peared on college campuses more than 10
years ago, when'MIT’s Sloan School of
Management opened its facility in 1996.

“Most schools have the same set of
features,” said Shastri. “But what is most
important is how the professors teaching
the classes incorporate the lab.”

Carnegie Mellon University, one of
the first schools to open a trading room,
quickly dismantled its facility after the
school deemed a space dedicated solely
to trading unnecessary after it became a
requirement for all students to own a lap-
top.

There is no fear of a similar disman-
tling at Pitt, since the software in the trad-
ing room is exclusive to a laboratory and
cannot be used on a laptop, said Shawn
Thomas, professor of business adminis-
tration at Katz.

“Students simulate a \Wall Street trad-
ing room with the same software packages
used by Wall Street firms,” said Thomas.

Training in a lab stocked with software
used by professional investors around the
world, such as Reuters, Morningstar and
Value Line, better prepares graduates for
careers in ﬁnance because they are already
familiar with real—world software upon
entering the job market. They already
have a feel of the ﬂoor.

-Graduate students also have the op-
portunity to work with real money.

Behind the large trading room is a
newly’ constructed space devoted to the
Student Management Investment Fund,
where students manage a portfolio and
make investment choices.

Not only is a trading room an asset
to students, but also to the school as a
whole.

“The lab is a toolbox for the school,”
said Thomas.

On top of providing hands—on learn-
ing for students, the addition of a trading
room serves as valuable marketing, devel-
opment and recruitment tools.

Impact ofﬁcers not going anywhere until Oakland 'quiets'

Impact, page 1

detail then, as well

“Like the South Side is now — 20 years ago,
that’s how busy Oakland was,” said Walsh. “Be-
cause of the amount of alcohol, there was a lot
of activity”

Both Walsh and Delaney said the detail ﬁzzled
out when the party left Oakland But the two sta-
tions have maintained a close relationship since the
ﬁrst Impact squad left live or six years ago.

That made the transition into the detail a
smooth one .

“It’s no different from what we normally do

on any  day,” said Vollberg, of the city police
‘The dynamics are the same”

But the bonds grow stronger The ofﬁcers at
both stations rotate in and out of the squad, which
is open to any ofﬁcers who want to volunteer for
It.

As a result, the ofﬁcers are  with differ-
ent people every few times they wod< the detail.

“You don’t even realize it,” said Delaney, who
worked on Impact in the late ’80s “When you
work together, you do develop a bond Because
you’re  for eight hours, you just start talk-

mg»

Delaney said the current Impact Overtime
Detail is here indeﬁnitely. If Oakland “quiets or
becomes uneventful,” he said, the city might pull
the detail.

Currently, the city police covers the cost of its
ofﬁcers, and the Pitt police shell out the $30or—so
per hour for each of its ofﬁcers on the team.

Delaney said Impact is “no more built into
the budget than when the Steelers won the Super
Bowl,” which goes to say that it’s not factored in

at all — following the Steelers’ 2006 Super Bowl

victory, masses of people ﬂooded into the streets,
congesting ttafﬁc and burning couches or ﬂipping

cars

But Delaney said his boss, Executive Vice
Chancellorjerome Cochran, has been supportive
of Impact

‘Thankfully, the University ﬁilly understands
the justification for what I want to do,” said Dela-
ney. “We base our decisions on what’s best for
the students, and if you’re on that track, you can’t
fall»

Poor Pittsburgh

Census ranks Pittsburgh as ﬁfth-poorest big
city in the United States

In its 2003 Annual Travel
Report, USA Weekend named
Pittsburgh one of the 10 most
beautiful places in America.

“The Steel City’s aesthetic ap-
peal is undeniable, as is its very
American capacity for renewal,”
said the report.

Undeniable, yes. For a city
that once lived beneath a dark
layer of smog and pollution,
Pittsburgh has come very far. So
far, in fact, that it’s easy to forget

 the city is still overwhelmed with

problems.

According to the 2007 Census
Bureau report, “Income, Earn-
ings and Poverty Data,” Pitts-
burgh ranks as the ﬁfth poorest
big city in the United States, be-

5 hind Detroit, Cleveland, Miami

and Buffalo.

In 2006, Pittsburgh was
named the seventh poorest big
city.

While residents of Pittsburgh
are making slightly more money
than they did last year, at $48,576,
they are still making less than the
national median of $50,740. Fur-
thermore, there have been only
small decreases in the number of
uninsured children and children
in poverty, and about 16 percent
of the state’s children still live in
poverty.

But what makes Pittsburgh
different from many other cit-
ies on the Census Bureau’s list is
that its problems are not always
noticeable. 0

Take areas like the Water-

Z front, SouthSide Works or Sta-

tion Square. These are all at-
tractive and lively places where
the idea of poverty seems like a
joke.

Pittsburgh includes
wealthy neighborhoods like
Shadyside, Squirrel Hill and
Point Breeze, communities that

also

i certainly do not reflect the city’s

‘ poor status.

Indeed, onthe surface, Pitts-

burgh does not look poor. A
drive into our city is much dif-
ferent than a drive into Detroit,
where signs of depression are
clearly evident.

Coming into Pittsburgh
through the Fort Pitt Tunnels,
for example, presents visitors
with a remarkable view of the
city skyline.

But underneath it all, Pitts-
burgh needs much improve-
merit.

City officials have. done a
good job of this so far.

Downtown apartments have
been revamped, and a new gro-
cery store is set to open in Oc-
tober near the corner of Fort
Duquesne Boulevard and 7th
Street.

These changes will undoubt-
edly allow the city’s urban center
to ﬂourish.

The gradual city-county con-
solidation is increasing efficiency
in government performance,
and Mayor Luke Ravenstahl’s
$100,000 Green Initiative will
soon make city—owned prop-
erties more environmentally
friendly. Finally, the rebuilding
of the stadiums years ago ush-
ered in a cleaner and more dy-
namic North Shore.

But like moving around fur-
niture to cover the stains on the
carpet, these improvements have
only grazed the surface of Pitts-
burgh’s troubles.

It will take a lot more time
and effort to eventually pull
Pittsburgh out of the poorest
city rankings for good. Major
changes must be made, from in-
frastructure to better health care
coverage

For now, it is important for
us to remember that while Pitts-
burgh generally looks appealing
on the outside, it is badly strug-
gling on the inside. We might
have come far, but we still have
much further to go.

Israel, America share colonial past

    

by Giles Howard
Colummltt

 
 

Since President Jimmy Carter’s
success with the Camp David Ac-
cords in the 1970s, modern presi-
dents believe it is their job to broker
a Middle East peace deal in their last
years of office Bush 41 presided
over the Oslo Accords, Bill Clinton
was involved with the Camp David
2000 Summit, and now Bush 43 is
making his own lame-duck conni-
bution to the cause of peace in Is-
rael.

But what almost all of these ef-
forts at peace have in common is
that they have failed.

These attempts have failed not
because of intifadas or acts of ter-
rorism perpetrated by Palestinians
but because peace deals brokered
by Western nations ignore the fun-
damental issue at hand in the Israeli
conﬂict". colonialism.

Israel is a settler nation, a na-
tion that occupies and pretends to
govern lands taken from others by
force. The continued building and

occupation of settlements in the
West Bank and Golan Heights is the
strongest example of the colonial
mentality of the Israeli population.

Although Western nations might
fail to understand Israel as the colo-
nial state it truly is, Palestinians are
under no such delusions. In fact,
one of the terms Palestinians use to
refer to Israeli settlements is “mus-
tamaraat,” which in Arabic literally
means “colony.”

Israel might have abandoned its
“colonies” in the Gaza Stiip and
the Sinai Peninsula, but the total
population of Israeli settlements in
the West Bank, East Jerusalem and
Golan Heights is steadily growing
According to the Foundation for
Middle East Peace, in 2005 the set-
tler population stood at 460,838 —
in 1990 the settler population only
stood at 227,500.

These 460,000 Jewish settlers
are more than a population statistic:

They are a clear impediment to a

permanent peace settlement in the
Middle East.

Of course, the fact that Jewish
settlements make peace impos-

sible is well understood in the world
community. Both the General As-
sembly and the Security Council
of the United Nations have passed
resolutions against settlements and
have demanded an end to their con-
struction.

However, no Western nations
are prepared to enforce these reso-
lutions, and no Arab nations are
able to enforce them.

Instead, the West turns a blind
eye to Israeli settlements while pay-
ing lip service to the cause of peace
at Camp David, Oslo and, most re-
cently, Annapolis, Md. '

Of course, as a settler nation
ourselves, we in the United States
are perhaps the last nation on Earth
that would ever tell the Israelis to
stop expanding their occupation.
If we begin to seriously criticize the
occupation of another’s land as an

act of aggression, we would only’

be undermining our own historical
position. -

And, frankly, it is the historical
image of our nation and its found-
ing that is at stake when issues such
as Israel are being discussed.

Politicians’ horoscopes reve

by Molly Green

 

Despite much persecution and
name—calling from nonbelievers,
whom I will now generalize and
collectively refer to _as “the conde-
scending skeptics,” I not only fol-
low horoscopes, but I also make
key decisions based on them and
often use my horoscope as an ex-
cuse for bad behavior.

Unfortunately, I suspect that
many leading politicians have not
been following my good example
by reading and obeying their horo-
scopes —'— politics, as you may or
may not know, is a hotbed for
condescending skeptics.

Therefore, as a selﬂess, up-
standing citizen, I will use my
own precious time to analyze and
advise several key- players in the
upcoming presidential election, if
only because I must, for the sake
of the country.

Name: Sen. Barack Obama

Sign: Leo

Horoscope for the month of
August (courtesy of astrology-
online.com): “Look into events

that you might ﬁnd interesting"

and compromise by doing a few
things that you both like to do.

Don’t let any money slip through
your ﬁngers this mont .” ‘
It’s obvious, or at least slightly
possible, that the ﬁrst part of this
horoscope is referring to Obama’s
primary competition: Sen. John
McCain. I suspect that the horo-
scope knows, as I know, that both
Obama and McCain’s favorite food
is pizza. Recently, the race for the
presidency has turned rather dirty
(and you know it’s dirty when Paris
Hilton is involved). Why not stop

with the mudslinging and instead '

unite over something that we all
love? Yes, clearly the horoscope is
advising ‘Obama to invite McCain
over for a pizza dinner date.

As for the second part of the
horoscope? Well, pizza is expen-
sive. Have you seen the price of
arugula these days?

Name: Sen. John McCain

‘ Sign: Virgo '

Horoscope for the month of
August: “You don’t need to pay
out in order to have fun. You have
done all you can to sort things out
on a personal level. Entertainment
could cost you more than you ex-
pect. You may ﬁnd a rare antique
this month?’ _

McCain is well known for his
attitude toward mixing money
and politics. Could the horoscope

be reminding McCain to stick to
his guns, especially with the Re-
publican National Convention,
an event choc full of big—money
donors, approaching faster and
faster? Because, frankly, I — and
obviously the horoscope, too -—-

. do not agree with his latest tactics.

Which brings me to the entertain-
ment portion of McCain’s horo-
scope:

What gives with those com-
mercials? Mr. All—About-the-Is-
sues-Fair-Play doesn’t seem to be
spending much time informing
the public about his ideas on 
well, anything actually pertinent
to our national government and
instead stoops to such low tactics
as comparing Obama to one Paris
Hilton —.ouch!. .

Let’s hope McCain does ﬁnd a
rare antique this month: his dig-
nit)’-

Narne: President George W
Bush

Sign: Cancer

Horoscope for the month of
August: “Don’t jump as quickly as
you usually do. You’ve been in a
rut, and you need to do something

_that will help you break the pat-

tern that you’ve fallen into. Don’t
try to twist things around so that
they sound more enticing. Offer

love and affection instead of con-
flict and rejection.”

Well, that was a rather dismal
(and accurate) horoscope. Luck-
ily, there is a lot of good advice.
It’s easy to agree that Bush is, as
the horoscope puts it, “stuck in
a rut.” And judging by his public
approval rating, which, according
to CNN, is at a meager 30 percent,
that rut is more than a little deep.

The horoscope is apparently
more optimistic than me that Bush
will ﬁnd a way to break his streak
of bad decisions. I mean, can you
teach a 4 year old to do quantum
physics? Some things just can’t be
done. ~

However, Bush can improve
his image if he follows the horo-
scope’s advice. He needs to stop
 the bad euphemisms. Using
phrases like “sectarian violence”
(does he even know what this
means?) in place of “civil war” to
soften up what’s really going on
can only work for- so long, espe-
cially because there are numerous

-tests on the Internet that purport

that the majority of Americans in
fact have a higher IQ than Bush.
Name: Sen. Joe Biden
Sign: Scorpio .
Horoscope for the month 0
August: “Sudden changes regard-

al all truths

ing work and colleagues are ap-
parent. Don’t be too hard on your
[running] mate. Be careful how
you handle friends and relatives,
they may take things the wrong
way. You can help them with dif-
ﬁcult projects.”

With his recent nomination
as Obama’s running mate and
potential vice president, it might
be appropriate to say that Biden
has had quite a fortuitous month.
I-low his luck proceeds from here,
however, depends on how well
he adheres to the horoscope’s ad-
vice.

Biden is known to be a loud-
spoken lad. He talks smack, and
he likes it; This will probably be
useful to the Obama campaign,

-but Biden must learn the phrase

“less is more.”

He needs to serve as Obama’s
support system, a helper who is
not afraid to get a little tough, kind
of like a police dog to Obama’s
policeman: friendly and stately

looking and loyal to most people,
"but when threatened, he’ll maul

the liver ‘right out of your stom-
ach.

Palestinians suffer from expanding Israeli settlements

Howard, page 8

‘ The Pitt News

Israel is, after all, a 21st—century example
of the colonial process that occurred in the
United States beginning in the 16th century.

It is only natural that a nation, such as
the United States, that is founded on a 400-
year occupation of another people.’s territory
should more fully empathize with Israeli set-
tlers than Palestinian refugees.

However, if, as I believe, our understand-
ing of the Israeli situation is based more on

historical memory than modern foreign policy .

interests, then the question arises: How does
the Jewish historical experience inﬂuence the
actions of Jewish settlers?

How do Israelis, who themselves suffered
a diaspora, rationalize  such a fate on
another people? ’ »

For hundreds of years, Jews suffered as a
landless minority throughout Europe and the
Middle East.

It is a history the world knows well and
one that I don’t believe I need to elaborate on

in a column.

However, the aspect that I have never
been able to understand about the situation in
Israel is how aJewish settler with the cultural
memory of persecution, discrimination and
genocide could dispossess a Palestinian family
of their land and, in so doing, condemn them
to the same fate

I’m not offering a solution to the Middle
East situation. I can’t even comprehend the
scale of the problem, let alone pretend to

solve it in 800 words. _

But the one  I do know is if success
is ever to be achieved in peace talks, then it
is important that historical identities and self-
conceptions be taken into account on both
sides.

The way we understand our own history is
often more important than the way it actually
happened.

Hello, all, and welcome back for yet another
year of my inane -music column

If you’re a freshman and a first time reader,
let me. assure you: Unless you love bro—rock
(Nickelback, Creed), fourth—rate emo/pop-punk
junk (Hawthorne Heights, All Time Low), barely-
authentic country (Toby Keith, Kenny Chesney),
fake hippie-jarn rock (OAR, Guster), brain—dead
hip-hop (Soulja Boy, Flo‘Rida) or complete si-
lence, it’s unlikely that what I write will offend
you, and we’ll likely get along just ﬁne

So enough with the precautions, let’s talk mu-
sic.

It was an exciting summer in Pittsburgh this
season, as more than a few choice acts decided to
stop by and say, “Hey,  Let’s play some rock

’n’ at.” Some of the best shows included Tom _

Petty and the Heartbreakers, The Black Crowes,
Yonder Mountain String Band and the Foo Fight-
ers, along with the one-two—three punch of The
Raconteurs, The Black Keys and Gnarls Barkley,
all of whom ripped the SouthSide \Works in half
as part of the New American Music Union festi-
val» . _

As school ended last April and I sat down to
compile the list of shows I wanted to check out
for the summer, something seemed a bit odd.
Usually a fan of smaller club dates, I noticed that
the near—rnajority of choice concerts were 
held at huge venues — from the Post-Gazette
Pavilion to the Petersen Events Center and even
the classy Byham Theater Downtown. And
what do shows at big venues mean? Big record
companies Andwhat do big record companies
mean?  tickets. And what do 
tickets entail? \Worst of all, of course, overpriced
beer. Paying neatiy double  for a beer? \X/ell,

I hadn’t been privy to for years You see, back

Arena shows showy, fun

Just In It, page 10

Fast-forward, say, a dozen years,
and I’d lost that magic of the big
arena show, the appeal replaced by the
draw of a sweaty club show with 300
people, not 30,000. Maybe ifs because
my tastes veered to the more obscure,
or maybe it’s because I took a vehe-
ment stance against corporations like
LiveNation, the company that has
almost single‘—handedly taken over the
mainstream concert business

Now call me nostalgic or corny
(I assure you, I am both), but this
summer; covering and  about
shows at Pittsburgh’s biggest venues,
I gained back a bit of that rock-spec:
tacle magic I’d been so captivated by
as achild. Andyou knowwhat? Ithas
nothing to do with musical taste

A good example of this magic I
experienced was seeing Mr; Jimmy
Buﬂet; I am not a Parrothead (the
name of his adoring fans) and I don’t
particularly like margaritas, but hot
damn the man can entertain. To a

main attraction was simply the stage

he played on. Palmtrees, tiki torches .3

and a barefoot litde bald man (Buffett)

Honestly, he oould’ve played “Mar-
garitaville” for three hours stxaight,
and it still would’ve been entertaining

That record collection included American icons
such as Bob Dylan and Neil Young And while
these artists ultimately had an impact on the group’s
music — no where is Dylan’s influence more pres.-
ent than the track “W/her1I’m Gone” off the band’s
latest release ——  up, the music was
more different than anything its contemporaries
were listening to

“It was very different With the music in Israel,
there are a lot of different styles But [American mu—
sic] was deﬁnitely diﬂerent,” said Yehuda. “Unfortu-
nately, there’s boenalotofwarand stufflike thar,in
that way . . . maybe the music was a littie lighter.’-’

Asfarastheband’sbeginningsgo,“Wejust
kind of hung out and jammed together and wrote
songs,’ ’ said Yehuda.

And then it began playingin small clubs in]eru—
salern and Tel Aviv

“Israel is such a small counrry— it’s a 25-minute
ride to Jerusalem. Over there you can’t really even
say ‘touring’ Its more- like ‘short car ride,”’ joked
Yehuda.

Itwas in these clubs in the major cities where the
band caught the attention of American college stu-
dents — who eventually brought them overseas

‘They wanwd to  the experience theyhad

I back to their campuses in North America,” said Ye-

huda about the students’ work to bring the group to
the United States a decade ago a

ing the United States and  in Israel It put out a
few records on its own budget, but was really look-
ing for a major label to release its music

That happened when Yehuda met famed music
industry publisher Ronny Vance, who’s known for
getting artists like No Doubt: and 2Pac on the main
stage But not right away — it took some persever-
ance to get Vance on board «

“It’s funny,” began Solomon. “He was a big
music industry guy. Hes Jewish, and one day
he decided he needed to connect with his ]ew~
ish roots, so he moved to Israel. People told
melshouldgoseehirnlwasnaiveandthought
hewouldgivernearecorddealrightaway

“I met him and told him about us, and he was
kinda sweet but at the same time kinda blew me oﬁf
But I didn’t  up. I kept  over to his house,

- kept playing him all our songs, and every time he’d

be like ‘Yeah it's all right, but there’s nothingl can
do for you.’ So I kept  over there until one day
he stood up and  his hands and said, ‘Bravo,
kids Now that’s a piece of business”’

‘The group’s first major—label release was 2006’s
Nlisplaced. It's a 13Ltrack disc with a sound that de-
fies any one category Produced by Ron Aniello
(Barenaked ladies, Guster, Lifehouse), the sound
fuses American rock, Middle Eastem vocal stylings
and traditional percussive elements

Despite its eclectic array of inﬂuences, though,
Moshax/s music is surprisingly accessible to the aver-
age listener;

“It’s all different music that we love, that’s what
we wanted to playf ’ explained Duvid about the
group’s inﬂuences “It’s a challenge to ﬁrse it into

onethingthatwo ”

“It seems like you have to have that nowadays,
something that makes you stand out a litde,” added
Yehuda. “The response has been incredible”

Adecade down theroad ﬁorn when they ﬁrsthit
American shores, it seems Moshav Band has found
success in its own right — which begs the question
of how its popularity has been affected back home.

“It’s funny, in Israel, anything from America is,
like, automatically a success,” laughed Yehuda. “It
makes us more exciting for them. They start playing
us more on the radio”

Halting of 9-year-old's

by Pat Mitsch
Senior Staff IV/'iter

Anyonewhohas everreceiveda speedingticket
knows speed limits can irtitate Nevertheless, forthe
most part, they’re necessary.

ButthespeedlimitjustissuedinNewHaven,
Conn, isn’t. It isn’t fair; either It’s pompous, if any-
thing,becausei€snghtdownd1elar1efromthe
pitchefs mound no home plate on a youth baseball
ﬁeld

It’s apparentiy 39 miles per hour, and because
9-year-old Jericho Scott’s fastball clod<s 40 on the
radar, he’s not allowed to pitch in his youth baseball
league

Reported ea1iierthisweekbyESPN,league of-
ﬁcials of the Youth Baseball League of New Haven
told Scott’s coach that Scottis no longer allowed to
pinchintheleaguebecausehethrowstoohard

\Y/hen Scott, akidwho justwants to playhis
favorite position, wouldrft surrender and took the
mound  after heating the news, the other team
pad<edupits stuifandleﬁ: Histeamwas forcedto
disband. The story also quotes the league attorney as
sayingthatifs dangerous forkids of thatageto face
that kind of speed

Theat:nomeysaid,accordingt3othestory,that
parents expressed concern over possible injury,
should one of their children be hit with one of
Scotfs pitches, though he’cl never beaned anybody

part of promoting a sport also promoting kids to

it, they’re supposed to be honored, right? Not
banned. V

If the league wanted to move Scott to another
league with more experienced players, it should have
