UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

CMU_shanty will
remain standing

By Frances Sansig
Staff Writer

Students at Carnegie Mellon
University have united with Pitt stu-
dents in an effort to persuade their
board of trustees to divest from South
Africa. , .

CMU’s Students Against Apartheid

-erected a shanty on campus last Fri-

day ”to recognize the people all over
the world who have to live in things
like this,” said Drew Waegel, a mem-
ber of SAA.

Around noon on Friday, Brad

Walters, dean of Student Affairs at
CMU, confronted the members of
SAA and ordered them to dismantle
the shanty, claiming it was in viola-
tion of university policy.
‘ According to a source at The Tar-
tan, CMU’s student newspaper, some
professors reported the shanty to
campus police, who called in the
report and ,were told, incorrectly, that
the shanty had been approved.

”[l1'ie shanty] does not represent at-

J titudes of the total campus,” said

Walters. Walters said he was acting
on a statement issued by Richard
Cyert, president of the university.

Debra Martin, a member of SAA,
challenged Walters to present the
document.

”The president says he wants it
down,” replied Walters.

”How can you endorse free speech '

and do this?" Martin asked, referring

‘to a policy in ‘CMU’s student

handbook.

That's the kind of

garbage Student Affairs
has been giving us since
I've been here.

,Wa|ters then asked Martin to con-
fer in private. She refused, asserting
that it was a public matter. Walters
then said hewould return at 1 pm.-
to discuss the matter further. He
returned only to say he would be
back at 2 p.m.

Students who were gathered at‘the
shanty speculated that the reasonfor
the upset was that it was CMU fami-
ly weekend. ,

"But that's the kind of garbage Stu-
dent Affairs has been giving us since
I've been here,” said Allen Green-
berg, a CMU student senator.

According to a source at The Tar-
tan, Dean Cox invited Martin to
Walters’ office. She initially refused
to leave'but conceded when she was
permitted to take other students and
a reporter with her. .

Martin and Cox reached an agree-
ment that the students would be per-
mitted to keep the shanty until Nov.
11, the day CMU’s board of trustees
is scheduled to meet. On that day,
SAA and the administration will meet
again, said the source. '

President Cyert was absent from
the group meeting.

Pittstudent attacked in South Oakland  

By Kathy Stahl

The Pitt News

A 19-year-old Pitt student was
raped in her third-floor apartment on
Atwood Street in South Oakland on
Oct. 26.

According to police reports, the '

victim had been sleeping when she
was awakened at 2 a.m. by someone
sitting in a chair next to her bed. The
assailant was holding a butcher's
knife and told thevictim, ”lf you
make a noise, I'll kill you."

The assailant was describedas a
15- to 19-year-old black male, ap-
proximately 5-4, with a thin build
and short-cropped hair. He was wear-

. ing a dark sweatshirt, jacket and jeans

at the time of the incident.

The assailant had entered the apart-
ment through a window in the kitch-
en. The victim's two roommates, as
well as another female and a male,
were in the apartment at the time of
the incident but were not aware of
what was going on. \ ,

The assailant told the victim that
someone had paid him to do this.

According to the police report, he
told the victim, ’’It’s a good thing
you're not ugly, so I don't have to kill
you.”

The assailant left the apartment at

Another Pitt student was sur-
prised by an intruder last Thurs-
day night, Oct. 30, when she
entered her Oakland Avenue
apartment. _

’’I walked in my bedroom, and
‘ he was behind the door armed

In truder matches rapist’s description

The victim said she believes he
probably was going to rob her
apartment. ’'I screamed, ‘What do
you want?’ and he said he just
wanted to get out,“and he left."

The landlords have since put
new locks on her apartment, .
which is owned by Property
Management, part of Pitt's off-
campus housing.

The description of the intruder
is similar to that of a rapist "who
broke into another South Oakland
apartment on Oct. 26.

He is described as a black male, .

approximately 14 years old, 5-2,
with very short black hair.

The victim said she fled her
apartment immediately after the
intruder had left and ran up the
street to find the police.

The police went back to the
apartment with her and searched
the entire building. The police
have since kept in contact with
the victim, who is still shaken by
the incident.

''I can't believe a kid that old is
walking around with ice picks,"
she said.

The victim was taken to McGee

declared in good condition.

On Oct. 3, a man attempted to
break into Judy's second-story
apartment.

’'It was in the middle of the after-
noon, about 2:30,” said Judy. ’’l was

screamed, he left.

”He was black, not older than 20;
he had a baby face, and he had real-
ly short hair,” said Judy. ”He was
skinny, maybe about 150 pounds.”

Judy-said that she called the Pitts-

burgh police. ”They didn’t*rea|ly do
anything,” she said. ”They just took
a report.” J

Judy said that she does not feel the
apartment building has inadequate
security.

”They [the housing agency] have
done pretty much all they could for
us," said Judy. ”The front door to the
entire building doesn't lock, but the
doors to the individual apartments
do. They also put bars on the
windows.”

Judy said that she did consider

A moving out, but she thought it would

be a "hassle getting out of the lease,”

and it would probably cost a lot of .

money. "But if I lived upstairs,” she
said, ''I’m sure I'd move out.”

The mother of one of the women
who had lived on the third floor said

' that her daughter had originally tried

to get housing on campus but did not
make it through Pitt's lottery system,
where numbers are drawn for dorm
rooms. .

She said that since they vifere not
from the area, they really didn't know
where to look for apartments. But af-
ter what's happened, she said her
daughter will no longer be living in
the apartment building.

Bulgarian chemical plant accidentkills 17

An accident Saturday at a chemi-
cal plant in Bulgaria killed 17 peo-
ple and sent 19 to the hospital for
”urgent medical attention,” s’tate—run
Radio Sofia reported.

The accident at the Devnya ”chem-
ical combine,” about 18 miles west
of Varna, came a day after Radio 50-
fia announced that the leaders of the
chemical industry in the Soviet-bloc
nation had been fired for in-
competence.

It said Saturday, in a report moni-
tored in London, that a special com-
mission had been appointed to
determine the cause of the Devnya
accident and "re-establish normal
production."

The commission ”will start work
on the spot immediately,” the radio
said.

It gave no other details of the ac-
cident.

On Friday, Radio Sofia said the rul-

ing Politburo of the Bulgarian Com- -

munist Party had proposed to the
government that the heads of the
chemical industry be released and its
central administration be ended.

it said that until new management
is in place, the day-to-day running of
the industry and preparation of the
next five-year plan would be handled
by specialists from the Economic

Council, the State Planning Commis-
sion and the State Commission for
Research and Technology.

U.S. chopper lands
in Cuba for fuel stop

MIAMI — The landing of a U.S.
Coast Guard rescue helicopter in
Cuba for. refueling sent officials to the
history books, looking for a
precedent.

Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Cmdr.
Jim Simpson said the refueling stop
authorized by Cuban authorities
Thursday may be the first landing of
a U.S. military aircraft there since the
early years of the Castro government.

Cuban authorities agreed to send
a bill for the fuel back with the crew
of the H-3 helicopter, which had
been called out to look for one of
seven people who had been aboard
the 100-foot coastal freighter New
Year when it sank 12 miles off Cuba

at a crossing and was hit by a pas-
senger train, injuring at least 32 peo-
ple, officials said.

A 20-ton steel coil on the truck
ripped through the first car of the
eight-car South Shorecommuter train
during the collision Thursday even-
ing, said police spokesman Bill
Burns.

’’I heard it [the coil]~ coming
through,” said Brad Carlos of Val-
paraiso, who was in the rear half of
the front car. ’’I kind of put my head
down. I saw sparks flying. The coil
hit the train’s bathroom and moved
it back several feet. If the bathroom
wasn't there, the coil might have
ricocheted to our side, and I wouldn't
be here.”

Methodist Hospital spokesman
John Canright said 13 people were
taken to the Gary hospital's emergen-
Cy room. Three of them were admit-
ted, including the train’s conductor,
Anthony Wajasinski of Michigan
City, who was in critical condition in
the intensive care unit, Canright said.

Eighteen passengers were treated

andreleased from St. Mary's Medi-
cal Center, and one passenger went
to a Merrillville hospital, officials
said.

ACLU blasts Meese

for drug abuse policy

WASHLNQTON — An American
Civil Liberties Union spokesman said
today a proposal by Attorney Gener-

ral Edwin Meese that employers

watch workers in locker rooms,
taverns and parking lots to help curb
drug abuse is outrageous and goes
against the American system of
justice. ‘

Meese, in a speech Thursday to the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, en-
dorsed strategies for preventing drug
abuse advanced by a former director

of the Drug Enforcement Administra- -

tion, Peter B. Bensinger.

Citing Bensinger’s philosophy,
Meese said ”manage’men't  has to
take its responsibility for surveillance

-of problem areas, such as locker

rooms, parking lots, shipping and
mail room areas, and even the near-
by taverns if necessary as a part of
controlling this problem.”

Drugs don't mix
well with sports

is there a drug problem among athletesat the University of
Pittsburgh? . . ,

That seems to be anlappropriate question to ask following former
Pitt football player Bill Fra|ic’s admission that he used steroids while

_playing at Pitt.

Steroids, which are used to help an athlete ”bulk up,” have been
known to cause abnormal reactions within the body. Steroids have

(also, both directly and indirectly, been linked to death.

Fralic said that while at Pitt, he used steroids for only a short time

and knew of others who took them.

_Keep inmind, Fralic was playing on offensive lines that produced
several NFL players, including limbo Covert and Russ Grimm. These
are thetype of linemen who younger players often view as role
models.

If steroids were ’’helpful’’ for Bill Fralic, a "three-time All-America,
they could easily be ”helpful” for any incoming freshman recruit.

The NCAA, its member schools, and the participating student-
athletes co-exist during a difficult period. This is an era when schools
are forced to compete in areas outside of the classroom — on the

“basketball floor and on the football field. lncreased revenue is the

difference between winning and losing.

Pitt, as well as other colleges across the nation, must keep a close
eye on its athletes and their training habits. The pressure to produce
must be toned down, not increased. Previously, the NCAA and its
member schools were making an effort to eliminate steroids from col-
lege athletics, but the cocaine-induced deaths of Maryland basket-
ball player Len Bias and Cleveland Browns’ safety Don Rogers shifted
the attention away from steroids. ,

The time is now to balance it out. Colleges, by concentrating on
elimination of one problem, make it is easy for other problems to

Higher education
is often forgotten

Today marks the beginning of Higher Education Week. It's a spe-
cial week set aside to recognize the achievements and contributions
that higher education gives to our society.

Higher education brings a wealth of new ideas and new approaches
to old problems to our society every day. Far too many people don't
realize these things. This week is meant to change that.

Were it not for universities, it would be tougher to see the world's

E problems from an international scope.

Higher education is probably this countrys’ least appreciated
resource. We have people who are willing to give their time, if for

' no other reason than to further the scope of knowledge. There exist

shamefully few research facilities where progress means more than
profits; universities and colleges are exceptions though.

Institutions of higher education deserve to be lauded for their ac-
complishments — for their past contributions and the contributions
that are to come.

Possible cures for cancer and for AIDS, solutions to international
tensions and the search for a better understanding of our world and
worlds beyond —— all lie in the realm of higher education.

Higher education has taken criticism for its unrealistic idealism in
the past, and that still may hold true today, but universities cast a
_ray of light on the shadows of ignorance, and because of that, they
deserve some sort of public acknowledgement. This week is a step

~ in that direction. .

I-IE1, THAT mm? CﬁN'T
EVEN SQUT 723 lbsl

    

Of late, there has been a lot said
about the Strategic‘ Defense Initiative,
i.e. ”Star Wars,” and what it is all
about and why it is getting in the way
of negotiations with the Soviet Un-
ion in the nuclear arms reduction
talks. Put simply, the Strategic
Defense Initiative was created out of
the United States’ need to obtain a
defensive measure which would
render hostile nuclear missiles impo-
tent by destroying them before they
could get near targets. SDI’s purpose
was, therefore, to create a protective
f’shield” which could be used to in-
sure that, in the event of nuclear ex-
change, the United States_wou|d not
be destroyed. Once perfected, SDI
would have the added benefit of pro-
tecting all nations allied with the
United States.

If the capability for a foreign nation
to attack the United States with
nuclear missiles became nonexistent
due to SDI, the United States would
then be in a position to eliminate
nuclear missiles from the armaments
of world powers. The primary goal of
SDI, therefore, would be the elimi-
nation of nuclear weapons before
they could ever be used. This elimi-
nation would not come from their be-

.ing destroyed on the ground as they

sit inttheir silos or just after they've
been fired; it would come before they
could ever be used by.making them
useless as weapons. Once the Rus-
sians found themselves in possession
of a large number of nuclear missiles
that they knew would prove ineffec-
tive in an attack, they would be com-

'pel|ed to destroy their missiles

themselves.

This method of causing the Soviet
Union's missiles, or for that matter
those of any hostile nation, to be-

. come ineffective before they could

be used can be termed as an indirect
approach at banning nuclear weap-
ons. Still more indirect is the role SDI
is playing at this moment. It is at-
tempting to bring the Soviet Union
to the bargaining table for serious
talks on nuclear disarmament. SDI is
supposed to cause the Soviet Union
to realize that if they do not serious-
ly want to bargain and eradicate
nuclear weapons, then they will be
faced with‘ the dilemma of possess-
ing a great deal of weapons which
they have spent billions of dollars to
develop — only to find that they can-
not be effectively used. The Soviet
Union is supposed to agree to
eliminate its nuclear weapons joint-
ly with the United States before SDI
can effectively be developed so that

' neithersidehas to spend billions of '
dollars on new systems of defense.

   

WILL
I YOUNG

In the present age, the nuclear
weapon is a veritable doomsday
machine, capable of destroying both
sides in the event of a war, should
either decide that it is necessary to
use it. SDI enters the scene with the
threat of placing the nuclear weapon
into obsolescence. The threat the
Soviet Union is supposed to see is

that, in the event of the hyper--

escalation of a war, they would not
be able stave off defeat with a nuclear
strike against enemy nations. Its mis-
siles would not get through to the
degree necessary to cause damage
from which the victim nation would
not be able to recover. Without the
nuclear missile to fall back on, the
Soviet Union would be forced to re-
evaluate its system of fighting ‘a

"world-wide war and realize that

peace is the best solution.

The Soviet Union, however, is not
receiving the correct impression of
the use of SDI because of the failure
of the U.S. State Department to con-
vey it to them. The Soviets are of the
opinion that SDI is meant as a pro-
tective umbrella that would allow the
United States to destroy Soviet mis-
siles and then fire their own in retali-
ation without fear of further Soviet
exchanges. To a degreee this is true,
but it does not hold with U.S. defense
policies that are easily recognizable
from past- U.S. actions. The United
States is not, as the Soviets would
have the world i believe, trying- to.
place itself in an invulnerable posi-
tion from which to dictate its will to
the world. Rather it is trying to ensure
world peace by rendering the. greatest
threat to peace — the nuclear weap-
on —— obsolete and utterly useless.

The basis for this Soviet belief is to-
tally unfounded and tries to play off
anti-American sentiments that are to
be found throughout the world. The
Soviets claim that SDI is in direct op-
position to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty which states, not in so
many words, that neither side is sup-
posed to possess‘ the capability to
eliminate enough missiles of the ene-
my so that they would survive a
nuclear attack. This treaty was an at-
tempt to get the Soviets to realize the
actuality of mutual assured destruc-
tion in the case of nuclear conflict.
In signing this document, bothsides

were adm_itting_._th_ew belief th__a_t "am

hope

nuclear strike would end civilization,

-and that neither side should possess

the power to blunt this effect. Both
sides were supposed to see the sense-
lessness of nuclear weapons and vow
never to use them, because using
them to destroy the enemy would
only end in mutual destruction.

The Soviet Union, however, is the
only nation to have a fully-working
ABM system in operation. This fact
alone leads one to conclude that the
Soviet Union is not really interested
in reducing the stock of nuclear
weapons or in world peace, but only
in furthering its influence in world af-
fairs with the hopes of eventually
isolating the United States. '

The Soviet Union must, then, believe
that it has the upper hand when deal-
ing with nuclear destructive capabil-
ity and the ability to survive such a
war.

Since the Soviet Union has repeat-
edly refused to swear off nuclear
weapons and remove them from its
arsenal, the United States was com-
pelled to devise a new system of

- defense, which would finally settle

the issue of whether nuclear weapons
would be useful or not. The United
States felt compelled to do this in an
effort to lessen the threat of war and
eliminate the threat of nuclear war.
The threat of a conventional war
would be eliminated through the fact
that for the Soviet Union to possess
as much military might in conven-
tional methods, it would be forced to

increase the size of its armed forces’
‘with appropriate increases in war

materials productions. The Soviet
Union does not want to be forced to
seriously rethink its methods of fight-
ing and winning a war in the future.

The Soviet Union isstill persisting
with the accusation that the United
States is not playing fair by trying to
eliminate nuclear weapons, because
without nuclear weapons the Soviet
Union is afraid it may lose its posi-
tion as one of the world's superpow-
ers. The United States, however, must
press the issue of SDI and force the
Soviets to come to terms with nuclear
reality or real peace. This can only
be done by furthering the threat of
SDl'through increased research and
development and by beginning actu-
al testing of the product. The argu-
ment with SDI is not, then, that it is
wasting billions of dollars in a possi-
bly fruitless chase for a defense that
can't be had, but that the furthering
of SDI researchmay eventually lead
to the. eliminationlofmuclear weap-

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November 3, I986

Racism: Closer to home  youk  

Editor's Note: The fOllOWf_f§l'g:Vr
column uses some strong language;

Don't be turned off though. Read to
the end to the point the writer is mak-
ing — in this case a valid one. The
people who discriminate most don't
belong here in the first place.

The other day I saw a friend of
mine named John. John is an Eskimo
from the Northwest Territory in Cana-
da. He came to America about three
years ago to finish high school and
then start here at Pitt. He, like many
students who come to’ Pitt from for-
eign countries, is having a little trou-
ble with ‘ his English, but, in any
event, here is what he said to me:

"You know, Chris, Pitt has got a
serious racial problem on its campus.
That's right, a problem right here in
Pennsylvania. And it's serious, too.
Forget about the rest of the world,
Pitt's got a problem all its own. Why,
just the other day I was walking down
the street, and do you know what I
saw? A honky. Is that how you say
it? Honky? |.think ‘Caucasian’ is the
slang term for it. Yeah, that's right, a
‘Caucasian’ right in theimiddle of the
street. There was more than one of
them, too. There were a lot of

Sphﬁng

If you've been outside lately,
you've undoubtedly noticed that
things are getting pretty disgusting in
America. I

I'm not talking about the political
climate or about street crime. I'm
talking about people spitting.

That's right — spitting. For some
reason, Americans seem to have
abandoned all of"their inhibitions

labout spitting in public and are now

spitting on the streets, on the side-
walks, out the windows of cars 
anywhere they feel like it.

I know that a lot of you read this
column over breakfast, so I will spare
you the details of how people spit.
Suffice it to say that they do it loudly
and openly with no consideration for
people around them. They go about
it as if it's a perfectly natural thing to
do — clearing out their throats and
lungs and depositing the results in full
sight of everyone else on the street.

It's revolting to watch. We are sup-
posed to be in the midst of a very
health-conscious era, and you would
expect that people would keep their
spit to themselves. But they aren't; at
any given moment there is spit flying
all over the nation.

In case you're thinking that some-

Divestment isn't the only option for

Writer's Note: An interesting slew
of letters came into The Pitt News
office after my column last Wednes-
day, “Apartheid is wrong, but will
divestment help?" The majority of
the letters claim that I am a racist be-
cause I oppose divestment.

I found the following article in The
Daily Orange, the student
newspaper at Syracuse University. ‘It
was publishedlast Friday and writ-
ten by a Syracuse student, James B.
Ellsworth. He and I share the same
opinion about the feasability and ef-
fectiveness of divestment.

Much has been said recently about
proposed divestment of holdings
with companies doing business in
South Africa. Unfortunately, much of
it fails to consider the complex and
unique factors of the situation.

Most of us would agree that apart-
heid is abhorrent. In our country,
blacks have demolished the argu-
ment that they are in any way inferi-
or to whites. Clearly, any system
denying them an equal part in socie-
ty is morally and socially retarded.

Divestment has been proposed as
one solution to this problem. A study
of the facts will, however, show it to
be a poor one.

First, let us consider what divest-
ment is and is not. It is not a formof

honkies. As a matter of fact, I think
it is safe to say that there was a whole
horde of those damned honk  those
damned ‘Caucasians’ out there. A
whole horde of them out there all
wearing their faded blue Levi's
jackets.

"And that's not all that was out
there, either. There were some nig-
gers, too —— is that how you say it?
‘Negro’ is the slang term for them, I
think. Yeah, a whole horde of niggers
out there with all the honkies. Not
really with the honkies, but close to
them anyway. You see, the honkies
and the niggers don't like each other.
Yeah, they're all idiots. Idiot ‘Cauca-
sians’ and idiot ‘Negroes.’

“And there were chinks, as well.
C-h-i-n-k-s, right? ‘Asian’ or ‘Oriental’
is their slang. Yeah, a whole horde
of chinks. And, you know what? I
think I saw some spics and injuns,
too. You know, ‘Hispanics’ and ‘In-
dians.’ Yeah, spics and injuns — all
out there with the honkies, the chinks
and the injuns like they owned the
whole street. I'll tell you, it was pret-
ty scary. ' -

races being on our campus. I-mean,
everyone knows how dangerous it
can be for us, well, you know, us nor-

mal folk —— with all those different ‘

races out there, it's amazing they
haven't started a war already. They
don't like each other, all these races.
They don't like each other at all.
,You've got your honk  ‘Caucasians’

that they don't like the nigg

ways screaming ‘racial prejudice’ on
-the part of the ‘Caucasians,’ and those
same ‘Caucasians’ are trying to get rid

everyone hates the chinks because
they raise the curves in the math
classes. That's not to mention the
spics and  the ‘Hispanics’ and ‘In-
dians,’ who have become racially
paranoid because of all this racial ten-
sion. They've been so conditioned to

thing should be done about this —
that someone should pass a law —
well, I agree. And I was surprised to
find'out that in the city where I live,
Chicago, such a law -is already on the
books. J

In the city of Chicago, Municipal
Code section 99-12 is titled “Spitting
in Public."

It is a little-known ordinance, but
it's right down there in black and
white. Here is the exact wording:

"No person shall spit upon any
public sidewalk or upon the floor of
any public conveyance or upon the

floor of any theater, hall, assembly .

room or public building, under a
penalty of not less than $1 nor more
than $5 for each offense." _

Now, granted, that's not much —
a buck or five bucks for each time a
person spits. But at least the law
exists.

As long as I've been around Chica— .

go, though, I have never seen a
police officer arrest a person for spit-
ting in public. I-consulted with a
working cop — Sgt. Joseph Joria of
the 18th police district — and asked

"him if he had ever heard of such an

arrest.

sanction against the white minority
government of South Africa. It is a
sanction against American business-
es operating in South Africa.

This has some interesting implica-
tions. One of the most obvious is that
if the companies refuse to pull out,
divestment‘s only effect will be to in-
jure American businesses.

But supposing they do pull out.
That's what divestment proponents
want, right? Suddenly, our good in-
tentions will have removed nine-
tenths of the jobs which recognize
blacks as human beings, and pro-
mote and pay accordingly.

Further, South Africa will lose the
revenue generated by those compa-
nies. While this might initially seem
good, we must consider what an op-
pressive minority regime will do
when times get tough. A few white
families will have to wait a few years
before they put in their new swim-
ming pools and tennis courts, but the
government will pass the worst of the
effect on to the oppressed black
masses.

Here we have the crux of the mat-
ter. Sanctions against a country, par-
ticularly an oppressive one, do not
hurt the government. They hurt the

country. And in South Africa, the .

country is the blacks — the people
we are trying to help.

“Spitting in the street?” he said. “If
it's happened, I've never heard of it.
A couple of years ago they were
cracking down on crime aboard pub-
lic transit vehicles, and I suppose
there might have been some arrests
for smoking and spitting and turnstile
stuff — but I even doubt that. I can't
imagine it." I

I asked him if he had even heard
any rumors about arrests for spitting.

oppose divestment. South Africa's lar-
gest tribe (seven million), the Zulua,
are protesting economic sanctions.

This would simply worsen an al-
ready dangerous situation, possibly
plunging the country into a bloody
‘revolution which would surely ex-
change a regime which oppresses
blacks for a regime that oppresses
everyone.

grudges. You'd think they were all
born with chips on their shoulders.

"That’s the problem. None of these

groups, not the niggers, the honkies, I

the spics, the,injuns or the chinks get
along with one another. In fact, I'd
say that they hate one another. There
are individual exceptions, of course,
but mostly —- the honkies in particu-
lar —— the groups all have an unjusti-
fied hate for all the rest of the groups.

“There’s even a humorous aspect
to this. When one of these groups is
thousands of miles away, like in
South Africa, everyone pulls for that
group, which is, in South Africa's
case, the niggers. When the
‘Negroes’ are home, everyone hates
them, but when they're thousands of
miles away, they're’ loved like so
many distant teddy bears.

"That’s just the problem with all
these people, dare I call them that —
they're stupid. Here they are, trying
to solve people's problems thousands
of miles away when they can't even
solve their own problems here —
when they can't even coexist with
one another.

that's on the books, but I have been
a police officer for T2 years, and I've
never heard anyone say he'd arrest-
ed a citizen for spitting.”

I asked him if he thought future ar-
rests might be likely.

“I’d have to say I doubt it," he said.
“Maybe if it becomes a national fad
— like if people start spitting off of
buildings onto people on the street.
Then we'd have to do something. But
otherwise I can't see any arrests be-
ing made."

I called the office of Cook County
State's Attorney Richard M. Daley to
see if his lawyers would be willing
to prosecute any spitters who might
eventually be arrested. After doing
some research, a spokesman for
Daley said that public spitting would
not fall under their jurisdiction; be-
cause the spitting law is a city statute,
prosecution would fall to the city cor-
poration counse|’s office.

So I called the city's Department of
Law and spoke with Edwin A. Gaus-
selin, the first assistant corporation
counsel. I asked him if he had any
opinion about public spitting.

"Are you asking me if I’m in favor
of spitting in public?" he said. “No,

a revolution in—South Africa. Even this
may not solve the problem. All that
is certain, if a revolution occurs, is
bloodshed.

The South African military has their
backs against the wall; They rank
among the best-trained and equipped
armies in the world. Further, South
Africa is famous as a source of em-
ployment for mercenaries. They just
might win; then how would things be
for the blacks?

Alternatively, the blacks might win.
I would say this is more likely. Im-
agine what would happen when a
people, oppressed for centuries, can
finally take no more and rebel. Or-
der will disintegrate. Every white re-
maining in the country will be killed,
as will all educated blacks serving in
the token black legislature (the very
people who should be taking over).

Remember what happens, even
now, to blacks suspected of cooper-
ating with the government? The
major leaders of the African Nation-
al Congress, the main revolutionary
group, make no secret of their in-
tentions.

What, then, is the solution? There
is no easy way out. Divestment

- would have been.nice. That is in fact,

why it's so popular. The American
people do not like to feel helpless.
We are reluctant to admit that there's
nothing we can do that would be

' opposite.

“Why don't they send them all

back to where they came from? Yeah; j I

sure, that would solve everything.
Just send ‘em all back. Get some kind
of big boat or something, carry them
back to wherever they came from,-

ill gross

I would have to say that I'm against
it. It sounds like a gross habit to me."
However, Gausselin said he can-
not recall any cases of public spitting
being prosecuted — because he can-
not recall any arrests. I
‘‘If the police start arresting spitters,
then we'll prosecute,” he said.
I asked him why he thought these
cases had not come to justice before.
“Put it this way,” he said. "If you're
a cop, and your job is to chase bur-
glars and rapists and murderers — are
you going to stop what you're doing
because you see a guy.spitting and
takethe time to arrest him?!" .. I ‘

Nevertheless, Gausselin said,‘ the 1

city's law department stands ready to
go to trial against the spitters should
the arrests ever be made.
And he had a tip. - "V
“You think spitting in public is dis-

gusting?” he said. “That’s section’
99-12. You want to talk about dis- '

gusting? Try section 99-I2.1."
“What’s section 99-12.1?" I said.

He started reading aloud from the ‘-

municipal code:

place any used facial tissue, or paper 

handkerchief upon any public way or
other public place ..."

tion’s way of life. (Invasion would
work, but is clearly unacceptable.)

Mild or token economic sanctions -

would be ignored by die-haird bigots
like Botha. Severe or meaningful
sanctions would hurt the blacks.

If a local business had a black em- I

ployee whose landlord was charging
unreasonable rent and harassing him

because of his race, would you de- J
mand that the the business fire the '
' black? This is essentially what divest-

ment is doing. Worse, it istelling the
business to leave the area. The fact

that the South African government ‘

has taken away the black AfriC_an’s
dignity gives us neither the responsi-
bility nor the right to take away their
livelihood. Jr

The inclination is to say "Well, we've

got to do something." In fact, we '

don't, nor should we, when allwe
can do is make things worse.

The disturbing fact is that in order .
to feel morally upright and self- »

righteous for having “done the right
thing,” we are willing to hurt the very
victims of the oppression we oppose.

I suggest that those staunch advo-
cates of divestment among us re-
examine their motives. Do they really
believe divestment will help the
blacks? I doubt it. In just this much

Bringing the process
to a close means voting

Tired of the hustle and.bustle of this year's congressional, guber-
natorial, state congressional and what-all races?

Well, take heart. This week, Pitt presents its own 1987 student
government elections.

The Elections Committee had a Meet the Candidates Night last
Wednesday. Some of you may have even blundered into_ the Public
Health auditorium that night. Student involvement isn't an issue in this
election for nothing.

For the approximately 29,900 of you who. couldn't make it, here's
approximately what happened:

The evening started with the candidates’ speeches, the main ideas
of which have been printed on these pages.

Then came a question and answer period.

Eleven of the 19 questions asked dealt with'the divestment issue.

Other questions covered such topics as motivating student involve-
ment on campus, the allocation of the student activities fund and the
campus housing problem.

If these or any other issues concern you, read the articles and vote
your choice on Wednesday and Thursday. ’

The polling places are open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and are located

’ in The William Pitt Union, Towers Lobby, Benedum Hall Lobby,

Lothrop Hall, David Lawrence Hall and Victoria Hall.

GOVERNMENT

BOARD

Presidential candidates

Jay Rothstein

As the business manager for last
year's Student Government Board,
SGB presidential candidate Jay Roth-
stein has observed and participated
in the functionings of the student
government.

Rothstein believes student involve-
ment is very important. ”C|asses
don't equal an education. Unfor-
tunately, many students think they
do. So they avoid joining campus or-
ganizations. I want to promote in-
volvement in every student group on
campus,” he said.

To do this, Rothstein is investigat-
ing the possibility of increasing the
allocations. He believes this will ena-
ble the different organizations to
sponsor more prestigious events
which will, in turn, attract in-
volvement.

Rothstein ‘also supports the con-
tinued divestment of Pitt funds from
South Africa.

‘'1 don't believe we can continue

 

to support a government based on ra-
cism. For this reason, I would con-
tinue to support Pitt's divestment,” he
said. ,

He wants the new board to pass a
similar resolution to last year's, re-
questing the board of trustees to
divest completely. He also wants to
continue the board's policy of sup-
porting divestment rallies and anti-
apartheid organizations.

Finally, Rothstein wants to" address,

the problems involved with life in
Oakland.

Responding to the increase in vio-
lent crimes in the Oakland area,
Rothstein proposes the formation of
a special board investigative commit-
tee which will be responsible for
reporting safety conditions in off-
campus housing to prospective ten-
nants. The reports would include in-
formation on recent crimes in the
area, the presence of safety doors and
the number of door locks.

Improvements in on-campus hous-
ing will be accomplished through in-
creased and direct involvement of the
Resident Student Association.

“I think that by far the best way to

improve student living conditions is -

through existing organizations,” he
said. '

"I think next year can be a good
year. I know some of my goals may
sound ambitious, but at least I can lay
some groundwork and set objectives
we all can reach,” he said.

 

Phil Moyer

Philip Moyer, 21, is a junior com-
puter science and philosophy major
and one of the two SGB presidential
candidates. ‘ '

Moyer stresses divestment from
South Africa as a major issue facing
the university. While acknowledging
that many favor divestment, Moyer
alsosees that some students question
its effectiveness. To correctly gauge
exactly where students stand in rela-
tion to divestment, Moyer, if elected,
plans to initiate a referendum on the
subject —— the first referendum in
seven years.

According to Moyer, even more
pressing than divestment is the issue
of safety.

”Safety, more than divestment, af-
fects us at a personal level. We walk
down the streets of Oakland at night,
and‘we’re not sure ifwe’|| make it to
our dormitories. That's not necessary.
What I’ propose to do about this is to
express toistudents the dire need to

4.

  

report all acts of crime and violence,”
explained Moyer. This will allow the
police to know just how serious the
situation is.

In addition to the divestment
referendum and stressing safety con-
cerns, Moyer makes other sugges-
trons to increase student involvement

at the university. One proposal is an

under-21 ”university nightclub.”

Moyer cites CMU, USC and Harvard,
who all have simular, successful

programs.

He also advocates that board mem-
bers attend City Council and Safety
Committee meetings and hold SGB
meetings at various locations across
campus (an idea borrowed from the
Engineering Student Council) and us-
ing random phone polling to find out

students concerns.

Moyer is currently a member of the
Allocations Committee, the Univer-
sity Senate Committee on Quantita-
tive Reasoning, the Senate Committe
on Humanities, a Mentor and a
brother at Delta Tau Delta. He also

has served on several Pitt Program
Councils.

lfelected, Moyer claims, ”l’ll be a
conscientious, prudent representative
of student opinion. And I'll hold the
university and administration ac-
countable for the welfare of the
students.”

Fiora Boehm

Student government candidate Fi-
ora Boehm, a junior with a dual
major in business and communica-
tions, is stressing the role of commu-
nications in her platform.

”Communication is the main topic
of my campaign. I think communica-
tion is the basis of a successful Stu-
dent Government Board,” she said.

Boehm is concerned with -getting
the students more involved with the
decision-making process in the
university and informing the student
body about the problems affecting
them. ‘ ’ . '

She also wants to bring the univer-

sity administrators ”down to the lev- _

el of the students and try and get
them to see student problems from
the students’ point of view.”

One of her goals for increasing
communication in the university is to
eliminate instructors whose English
is ”incomprehensible.”

‘Unsatisfactory student living con-
ditions are another problem Boehm
wants to address.

The shortage of off-campus hous-
ing is an example of the problem. ”I
don't know how much power the stu-
dent board is going to have in order
to change that, but I'm going to go
to great extents to see if there can be
anything done,” she said.

    

Roan Confer

Roan Confer- is 'a“junior economics
and political science major who is
running on the idea of leadership
rather than any particular issue.

l think for a candidate to stand up
and promise to change [something]
or, say, guarantee divestment, is’not
accurate. The student government
does not have the power to guaran-
tee these types of things. They can in-
fluence,

mendations,” he said.

He wants to attend the meetings of
the various student organizations to
keep the channels of communication
open.

In addition, Confer supports the
idea of increasing the frequency.of
student assembly meetings and mak-
ing them truly mandatory.

Conter is chairman for_ Pitt's chap-
ter of College Republicans, as well as
secretary for College Republicans of
Pennsylvania.

’’If any student asks me what my
opinion is on a certain issue, I would

_ be glad to give it to him, but I feel

it's more important, once the Student
Government Board is elected, to take
that group of people and go out to
the students and find out what the
students want to have done and to act
on that,” he said.

Maria Kersey

Maria Kersey is a sophomore
majoring in business whose main
goal in running for the Student
Government Board is to continue and
possibly expand the efforts of the stu-
dent goverment to bring about the
c;iiversity’s total divestment from
South Africa.

”l would do whatever it takes to
pressure the university to" wash its
hands clean of South Africa,” she
said. ' , ‘

She is also concerned with keep-
ing the student body informed about
what their student goverment is
doing.

’’I propose to use The Pitt News as
an instrument to cover [the student
government] to the fullest extent,”
she said. _ _

The most controversial of her
proposals is to raise the student ac-
tivities fee by $1.

In her view, such a move would
enable the board to increase the al-
locations, which in turn would en-
able student organizations to sponsor
better events.

”Now just think about that one dol-
Iar for one second. That one dollar
could go toward a soda, maybe a
soda and popcorn, but that one dol-
lar [in the activities fee] will afford
more adequate funds for next year,"
Kersey said.

Melanie Naro

The only incumbent board mem-
ber running for student government
this year, Melanie Naro wants to con-

tinue to serve the students to the best

of her ability.

”Being an incumbent gives me a
slight edge,” Naro said. ’’I know what
forms have to be filled out,~who has
to be seen, what channels have to be
gone through to start something.”

She also supports the idea of a stu-

dent referendum on the divestment
issue. , .

Concerning allocations, Naro said,
”Last year‘| was the picky board
member. I would ask a lot of little
questions. I fought for a lot of student
organizations-about [receiving] what
I felt they d_eserved,'f she said.

While fighting for student organi-
zations, Naro also expects them to
show a little responsibility to the
board. . ‘

Turnout for Student Assembly
meetings had been less than satis-
factorv. V .-

”Out of, I think 105 student organi-
zations, something like 20 or 30
showed up,” Naro said.

Naro would enforce attendance by
promising to enact the board-given
power to freeze an organization's al-
located funds.

  

, Therese McFadden

Therese McFadden is a junior
majoring in political science and eco-
nomics.

As a member of the Governmen-
tal Relations Committee, McFadden
takes a different approach to student
issues. - '

.”| believe-in working toward‘ state-

wide student issues instead of just’ _
making tired promises on issues that ; = '

could never be resolved,” she said.

McFadden believes that an impor-
tant role of the Student Government
Board is to use its Governmental Re-

lations Committee_ as a contact or- V

ganization to the state's legislators.
”If we work toward lobbying, we
could help the reduced student aid

problem,” she said.

McFadden wants to use the board
_to help enact House Bill No: 6.

This bill would call for the com-
plete and total divestment of all’ state
university funds from South Africa.

”If Dr. Posvar does not want a cam-
pus referendum, maybe we should
push toward House Bill No. 6 to
force divestment," she said.’ _

She is quick to deny that hertotal
goal is to present the board as a lob-
bying organization.

”It’s not that I'm trying to ignore
campus issues. I just wantto try work-‘
ing towardsolving them from a differ-
ent angle.”

Amy Danzige

Student Government candidate
‘Amy Danziger is running on a plat-
form backed by a long list of previ-
ous political and |eadersh_ip positions.
Danziger’s experience includes
participation in Student-Govern-
mental Relations -- a liaison group
that tracks and lobbies for student in-
terests in government. Danziger, a
20-year-old political science major,
also interned this past summer in the
Washington office of Senator Bill
Bradley as a legislative corres-
pondent
Here at Pitt, Danziger has been in-
volved with the Pitt Program Coun-
cil and is a little sister at Sigma Chi.
As an Student Government Board
member, Danziger said her primary

concern would be to work toward

decreasing student apathy.

”One of the reasons for student
apathy is the incorrect use of the Stu-
dent Relations Committee  [which]
provides public relations. I do.not feel
that the Student Government Board
has used it to its full potential," Dan-
ziger said. V

Danzinger recommends the use of

bulletins and suggestion boxes to get
student input. Other points that Dan-
ziger advocates are testing TAs on
their mastery of English, an escort
service, improved campus safety and
Pitt divestment from South Africa.

 

Rose Cardone

SGB candidate Rosemary Cardone
is a native of Warren, Pa., and is a
junior majoring in health records ad-
ministration.

As a freshman, Cardone held the
offices of RSA president and treasurer
for Tower A along with serving on the
Pitt Program Council's Homecoming
Committee and participating in the
university's Emerging Leader Pro-
gram. Cardone is a sister at Kappa

- Kappa Gamma where she currently

is responsible for public relations.
Cardone’s major concern is the
qualifications of the advisers here at
Pitt. Cardone contends that many ad-
visers -— particularly in CA5 - were
appointed to their positons and, in
fact, dislike their jobs. This, said
Cardone, is reﬂected in their perform-
ance and results in situations where

they do not always know, or make
a serious effort to know, what is best
for students. If elected, Cardone plans
to try to amend this problem by push-
ing for a redeﬁnition of the guidelines
for hiring advisers.

Another goal of Cardone’s is a
stronger Student Assembly; the pri-
mary benefit being that student or-
ganizations would be able to obtain
the support of other organizations in
their projects, making their activities
a greater success.

 

Vince Altomare

SGB candidate Vince Altomare,
20, is a junior math major from Bucks
County, just outside of Philadelphia.
He served two years in RSA and is
currently an RA and a Mentor.

Altomare’s platform is -built on
three major concerns: safety on and
off campus, complete divestment
from South Africa and the parking sit-
uation in Oakland. '

To increase the level of safety for
Pitt students, Altomare .would, if
elected, continue the work started by

the current SGB on an escort service.
He would also push to continue the
_recent increased effort by campus
and Pittsburgh police in Oakland.

Altomare is a staunch advocate of
complete university divestment from
South Africa.

’’I think we have to get out [of
South Africa] — irregardless of the
cost,” Altomare said. ”We have to
keep student concern up and con-
tinue letting the board of trustees
know how we feel."

Altomare also cites parking for
commuters as a major objective. He
proposes the establishment of a park-
ing permit program that would guar-
antee parking spaces in local garages
for commuters.

as

said, ’’If the students are to become
more involved, they have to be aware
of the issues that concern them. The
board has to be accessible/’.

The 20-year-old junior suggests
opening up communication by mak-
ing better use of the media here at

Pitt. Through some type of advertis- A

ing, a forum between the board and

students could be established, help-'

ing to generate feedback.

Another point which Kontos would
stress, if elected, is safety. He said the
recent upgrading of safety on and
around the campus must be main-
tained and, if possible, improved.

The final major issue of Kontos’
platform is increasing the amount of ,
communication between the SGB’

V and student organizations. If the Stu-

dent Government Board becomes
more aware of student concerns, said
Kontos, the SGB will be more ef-
fective.

Kontos would also have the SGB_
become involved in encouraging stu-
dents to participate in campus organi-
zations.

 

Pamela Rich

Pamela Rich, a candidate for the
Student Government Board, cites stu-

dent awareness as a main concern,
To promote SGB responsiveness to

the interests of students, Rich would
push for the Affinnative Action Com-
mittee to place comment boxes in the
lobbies of the William Pitt Union and
the Towers.

”This would enable us to get some
feedback from the students, to know
what they'd like to see done. It would
also create a stronger communication
between the Student ‘Government
Board and the students,” Rich said.

The second point of Rich's platform

is to increase student awareness. To ‘
. accomplish this, Rich suggests that

the Student Relations Committee
publish SGB minutes so that students
are aware of what the board is doing.

Rich plans to devote her efforts to
the proposed student escort service.
The service would be set up so that
when students are not able to use the
”buddy system,” a student volunteer
would act as an escort.

Rich, 19, is a sophomo_re from
Philadelphia and is majoring in busi-
ness communication. She states that
her dedication, straightforwardness
and assertiveness are traits that would
make her an effective SGB member.

  

Kelly McQuoid

Sophomore Kelly McQuoid, 19,
said she believes communication be-

7tween the Student. Government

Board and students is currently
lacking. -
To alleviate this problem,
McQuoid proposes several solutions.
One is to publish_SGB minutes, mak-
ingwhat occurs in the meetings more
accessible to students.

H’coming confusion resolved
By Kathy Stahl

News Editor

_ This was part of the reason for
the confusion. ”We had no idea
that we were to supply the roses,”
Confusion over the way the Pitt
Program Council handled the
recognition of this year's
homecoming king and queen,
Michele Bellamy and Thomas
Brooks, has been cleared up.
According to the Oct. 31 Pitt

lations officer for the Black Action
Society.

Roberts said that nobody had
contacted the BAS to let them
know beforehand that Bellamy
and Brooks had won.

According to Culp, that is im-
possible to do because ”no'one
knows who wins until they an-
nounce it.” .

Culp said that the roses were an
oversite on the part of the PPC but
that it was corrected, and Bellamy
did receive roses on Oct. 31.

Regarding the special recogni-
tion, Simms said, ”I didn't know
that they had a special dance, and
they did.” -

Religious colleges making   
a return with new guidlines

Editorfs Note: This is the first in a
series of three articles produced for
The Associated Press by the Pennsyl-
vania Association of Colleges and
Universities in observance of Higher
Education Week.

PITTSBURGH (AP) —— Pennsylva-
nia's religious colleges are enjoying
renewed popularity in the mid-'80s,
according to a statewide sampling.
Yet new economic realities are sub-
tly shifting the character of these in-
stitutions.

At many religious colleges and
universities:

some instances rising dramatically.

0 New courses that teach values,
as well as skills, are flourishing.

dance —- continue with little student
resistance at various Catholic and
Protestant institutions.

0 There is an increased emphasis
on voluntary, off—campus social work.

”With today's emphasis on tradi-
tional values, religious institutions are
demonstrating renewed vitality,” said
Robert Smith, public relations direc-
tor at Grove City College.

As with several Protestant-affiliated
colleges in the state, Grove City is be-
coming less dependent on church
funding while steadily maintaining its
Christian character. Though Grove
City remains affiliated with the Pres-
byterian Church, the student body
now represents some 30 religious
denominations. About 20 percent of
the students are Presbyterian; more
than 20 percent are Roman Catholic.
Total enrollment is 2,200.

The religious character of Grove
City remains strong. ”Spiritual values
are as high as they've ever been,”
Smith said. Each Grove City student
is required to attend 16 chapel con-
vocations each semester. The serv-
ices vary and include traditional
worship services, as well as tributes
to outstanding moral leaders.

All Grove City students are also re-
quired to take courses ”that explore
the religious" and philosophical
dimensions of life.’’ '

Service to others is also empha-

.. sized‘ at Grove City. More-than 100

campus organizations are involved in
community activities, including work

with the poor, the elderly and the dis-
advantaged.

At Lancaster Bible College, strict
course work and the campus environ-
ment continue to attract students
throughout the world. Public Rela-
tions Director Richard Wilson reports
that this year's freshman class is 50
percent larger than in 1985. Enroll-
ment is steady at about 500 students.

Though interdenominational, Lan-
caster emphasizes a fundamentalist
approach to the Bible. The curricu-
lum is centered on a bachelor's of
science in Bible studies. A year of
study in Israel is optional.

”[Outside the classroom] the rules
are tough ones,” Wilson said.‘ No
drinking, no dating, no room visita-
tions, no movies and no dancing. A
dress code is strictly enforced. Still,
students rarely transfer. ”Our stu-
dents have made serious commit-
ments to this lifestyle before they
come here,” Wilson said.

At Villanova University, the Cath-
olic character is ”as prominent as
ever,” according to spokesman Eu-
gene Ruane. Though the percentage
of Augustinian priests on the faculty
has sharply decreaed, the administra-
tion and board of trustees ”remain
overwhelmingly Augustinian,” Ru-
ane said.

Eighty percent of the student body
is Catholic — a slight decrease in re-
cent years.

Villanova continues to require all
students to take theology and
philosophy courses. And though en-
gineering, commerce and finance are
the most popular majors, Ruane
reports ”a renewed push to bolster
the liberal arts.”

Another current strategy is ”to trim
undergraduate enrollment” from
6,400 to about 6,000 students. The
move will increase admission selec-
tivity and also allow all students to
live on campus.

Villanova is likewise emphasizing
its campus ministry efforts, now in-
volving both lay ministers and priests.
A number of outreach programs are
aimed at helping Villanova's urban
neighbors in Philadelphia's main-line
suburbs.

Seton Hill College in Greensburg 2

is proving the enduring appeal of
small Catholic women's colleges in
Pennsylvania. Sister Jean Boggs,
director of institutional advancement,
said enrollment ”has been holding
steady” through the 19805. Due to
demographic and economic changes,
many students today are working
women from the surrounding area.
Seventy percent of the students are
Catholic.

Religious studies are required, and
students are particularly encouraged
to study peace and justice issues. An
active campus ministry works with
children, the poor and elderly in
southwestern Pennsylvania. And on
campus, students adopt and care for
the elderly nuns.

The Syracuse Orangemen, shown here celebrating a touchdown, pulled off a minor upset at the Carrier Dome Saturday beating Pitt 24-20.

Pitt bowl hopes crushed by Orangemen

By John Erjright

Sports Editor

Football, like any other sport, is a
game of inches. The team that can do
the little things right during the course
of a game usually comes out on top,
while the team that fails to capitalize
on its opportunities will more often
than not suffer a defeat.

That sums up the Pitt Panthers’
24-20 loss -to the Syracuse Orange-

men at the Carrier Dome last
Saturday.
”We ‘missed some scoring

chances,” said Panther coach Mike
Gottfried. ”We didn't execute on
offense or defense; consequently, we
lost.” »

The loss leaves the Panthers’ record
at 4-3-1 and, with games remaining
against Miami of Florida, Rutgers and
Penn Sate, Pitt's bowl hopes are
almost nonexistent.

Once again the Panthers dominat-
ed the game statistically in every
category but one —- the score.

Early on in the game both team's
offenses stalled. Pitt wasn't helped by
the fact that its ace quarterback John
Congemi went down with a back in-
jury midway through the first quar-
ter. But seldom used back-up Joe
Felitsky came in and led the Panthers
on a nine-play, 50-yard scoring drive
which was capped off by freshman
Jeff VanHorne’s 39-yard field goal.

And when the Panthers’ Carnel

Smith blocked a punt on “Syr_ac_use’s‘ A

ensuing possession at the 10-yard
line, the Orangemen appeared to be
in for a long afternoon.

But not so quick. In the excitement
over the blocked punt, five Pitt play-
ers swarmed the ball as it headed for
Syracuse's goal line, but no one
could hold on to it. The ball rolled
into the end zone for a safety. Two
points for Pitt. A blessing in disguise
for the Orangemen.

While Congemi tried to shake off
the cobwebs on the sideline, Felitsky
drove Pitt down the field in the early
stagesof the second quarter, but Van-
Horne missed a 43-yard field goal
attempt.

The Orangemen took over posses-
sion ‘on their own 26-yard line but,
two sacks and an intentional ground-
ing penalty later, they had to punt
deep from their own end zone. A bad
snap from the center prohibited Syra-
cuse punter Tim Fox from getting the
kick off. Panther linebacker Ezekial
Gadson pushed Fox out of bounds for
the second Pitt safety of the day.

Congemi returned to the game on
the next series and drove Pitt into
field goal position where VanHorne
booted a 46-yard field goal, increas-
ing Pitt's lead to 10-0.

A 10-point lead is comfortable, but
it's nothing to shout about. Yet, with
the way Pitt's defense was dominat-
ing Syracuse quarterback Don
McPherson and the Orangemen
offense, this lead seemed to be
monumental.

On this day, it wasn't. Starting from
their own 9-yard line_with three

g minutes left in the half, McPherson

caught fire. He was able to elude the
Panther rush for the first time in the
game, scrambling out of the pocket
and finding open receivers. On a first-
down play at the Pitt 11, McPherson
found his favorite target, Scott
Schwedes, in the corner of the end
zone. The touchdown cut Pitt's lead
to a not-so-monumental 10-7.

More importantly, the Panthers lost_
their momentum. Defensive end
Tony Woods agreed. ”That_ drive
took a lot out of us,” said Woods.
”We felt that we were playing excel-
lent football up to that point.”

Pitt’s downfall continued early in
the second half, mainly because of
their inability to take advantage of
golden opportunities.

The Panthers blocked another punt
at the Syracuse 18, but Congemi
threw an interception at the 3-yard
line, just as he had on Pitt's first'pos-
session of the game.

Twojblocked punts inside the Syra-
cuse 20-— two points to show for it.
That‘is_r'i’t what makes a winner. ”We
blocked a couple of kicks and didn't
come out with much,” said Gottfried.
”You have to be able to get some
touchdowns.”

Nevertheless, when Van Horne

booted his third field goal of the day '

on»Pitt’s next possession, the Panthers
lead was extended to 13-7.

stripped from his arm. Three Panther
defenders were right there ready to
pounce on the loose football.

Syracuse running back Robert
Drummond, who ran for 100 yards
in last year's win over Pitt, was again
a thorn in the Panthers’ side. Drum-
mond came out of nowhere and
sneaked into the ‘pile to recover the
football. Three plays later Schwedes
caught the winning touchdown pass
from McPherson. Bowl hopes are just
about down the drain.

At the beginning of the fourth
quarter Pitt was faced with a third-
and-one at its own 26-yard line. Af-
ter calling a time out, the Panthers
lined up three running backs on the ,
play. Sophomore fullback Craig
”lronhead” Heyward was sent into
motion. Congemi faked the handoff
to Charles Gladman and found iron-
head all alone at the 45-yard line.
Heyward turned on the afterburners
and out—raced Syracuse defensive
back Marcus Paul to the end zone, 1
giving Pitt its last lead at 20-17.

Obviously, it was another tough
loss for Pitt to take. Seldom does this

Penn State defeats West Virginia at Morgantown

By Rick Gano
AP Sports Writer

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. — Quar-
terback John Shaffer drove Penn State
for a touchdown on its first posses-
sion Saturday night, but from there
the second-ranked Nittany Lions had
to rely on four field goals from Mas-
simo Manca and an unrelenting
defense to gain a 19-0 college foot-
ball victory over West Virginia.

’’It was good to come down here
‘and take the first drive and make a
big-league drive, and after that we
sputtered all over the place,” Penn
State coach Joe Paterno said. It was
the sixth time this season that Penn

session.

Paterno said the Nittany Lions, who
have now beaten West Virginia‘29
times in their last 31 meetings, ”got
a little greedy at times” after Shaffer’s
23-yard pass to D.J. Dozier capped
a 91-yard first-quarter scoring drive.

”We had people trying to make
things happen instead of doing the
things they are supposed to do,”
Paterno said. ”They were trying to
make big plays  instead of just peck-
ing away and doing what we do
best.”

What the Nittany Lions did best
Saturday was play defense, allowing
West Virginia past midfield only
three times. The Mountaineers, 2-6
and condemned to their first losing

nine first downs in their sixth con-
secutive defeat.

”Defensively, without a doubt, it .

was one of our best performances
since I've been head coach here,”
West Virginia coach Don Nehlen
said. ”We just can't make a big play
on offense, which you have to against
a team like Penn State."

Manca, who missed on two first-
quarter field goal attempts, hit from
42 and 37 yards in the second quar-
ter as the Nittany Lions took a 13-0
halftime lead. He connected from 22
and 27 yards in the third quarter af-
ter Penn State twice drove deep into
West Virginia territory.

Shaffer, who completed 11 of 20
passes for 171 yards, said, ”Anytime
you can put points on the board on
the first possession, that's a good po-
sition to be in. Unfortunately for us,
it was the only touchdown we scored
all day. We got close but we should
have been able to put more points on
the board.”

Ray Roundtree’s 30-yard run on a
reverse and Shaffer’s 18-yard pass to
tight end Brian Siverling were the big
plays of the opening drive.

Dozier made his touchdown catch
just inside the left sideline near the
goal line, beating West Virginia cor-
nerback Stacy Smith and linebacker
Matt Smith.

Dozier, who passed Lydell Mitch-
ell to become the No. 2 career rush-

. er in Penn State history, broke off a

32-yard run to the West Virginia
3-yard line in the third quarter. But
the Nittany Lions had to settle for
Manca’s 22-yarder after Shaffer was
sacked on a third-down play from the
2.

On Pen_n State's next possession,
Manca hit a 27-yarder after the Nit-
tany Lions had reached the West Vir-
ginia 10 following Duffy Cobbs’
interception of West Virgina quarter-
back Mike Timko at the WVU 39.

West Vi rginia’_ s deepest penetration
came in the fourth quarter when Tim-
ko’s 54-yard pass to Grantis Bell
moved the Mountaineers to the Penn
State 19. But the drive was stopped
when Timko fumbled on a fourth-
down—and-5 play at the 14.

It was Penn State's second con-
secutive shutout of the Mountaineers
and gives the Nittany Lions .3 43-8-2
lead in one of college football's most
lopsided rivalries. Penn State won last
year's game 27-0.

Penn State limited West Virginia to
only eight yards rushing and 134
yards total offense.

Manca’s six field-goal attempts set
a Penn State record and his four field
goals were one short of the school

mark he shares. He kicked three in

last, week's 23-3 victory over
Alabama.

West Virginia stayed close by sack-

because the offense could not move

In the past, quarterback John Con-
gemi has defended his receivers and
given them nothing but praise, but
the numerous dropped balls are start-
ing to wear on him. ”Obviously we
have to go back to the drawing
board,” said Congemi about the
dropped passes. ”We have to con-
centrate a little more."

0 One player who could help the
situation at wide receiver is sopho-
more Reggie Williams, who broke his
fibula in the third game of the year
against Purdue.

Williams is healthy now and prob-
ably could play against Miami this
weekend, but he is still eligible for
a redshirt. ”I don't think it's been
decided yet [about a redshirt]," said
Williams, Pitt's leading receiver in
the first three games of the year. ”|t's
something we're still looking at, but
I think maybe this week they'll
decide.

’’I don't think they want to risk a
whole year [of eligibility] for the last
three games of this season. I would
rather sit out. If they really needed me
and if I can help the team, I could
come back,” said Williams.

Williams said that right now he is
not 100 percent healthy, but he
thinks he can play. He dressed for the
Syracuse game, and he said it wasn't
easy watching when he could be
helping. ”It's tough sitting on the
sidelines,” said Williams. ”Especial-
ly in a game like this when we lose.
It's real rough." . .

Pitt players were more than im-

”He’s a very good quarterback,” said

defensive lineman Anthony Siragusa. .

”He sees the field really well, and
with his quickness he can really
avoid pass rushers." -
”McPherson’s by far the most ath-

bring down. He's got a great feel for
a defender coming from the blind-

Stoudt leads Cardinals over Philadelphia

By Paul LeBar

AP §norts Writer

ST. LOUIS — Cliff Stoudt, while
unlimbering his passing arm to extri-
cate the St. Louis Cardinals from a
hole, also found use for his tested
legs.

”That’s something I've done be-
fore,” the 31-year-old quarterback
said of a 17-yard bootleg that
launched Sunday's 13-10 comeback
triumph over the Philadelphia Eagles.
”The play was there, especially the
way we've run sweeps all year.”

St. Louis, reeling at the end of three
quarters and shackled with a 10-0
deficit, capitalized on Stoudt’s
resourcefulness and experience to
rebound.

”He called the play himself,” St-

.

MONDAY,
TUESDAY,

Louis Coach Gene Stallingsgsaid of
his backup quarterback’s run. ”He
recognized the (’46’) defense they
were in and thought the play would
work.”

Stoudt, who galloped to Philadel-
phia’s 9, found wide receiver Roy
Green open in the end zone on a
14-yard play to kindle St. Louis’ first
hope with 5:04 remaining.

The eighth-year quarterback after-
ward had 2:55 to work with when the
Cards got the ball back. He sent
Stump Mitchell on a 27-yard run,
then handed off to the same player
for a 1-yard touchdown play with 36
seconds left. ,

Stoudt’s heroics at the finish fol-
lowed his less than auspicious begin-
ning in a relief role for St. Louis’
starting quarterback Neil Lomax.

’’When I got in there, I was a little
bit shaky,” said Stoudt, whose se-
cond pass was intercepted by Roynell
Young to set up an Eagles field goal.
’’I was surprised how long it took to
knock a little of the rust off.”

Philadelphia, following Young's
piracy, advanced 31 yards to set up
Paul McFadden’s field goal of that
distance for its 10-0 advantage.

But earlier the Eagles missed
another opportunity that proved to be
costly. McFadden, kicking from the
Cards’ 20, missed wide left at the first
half’s conclusion after safety Andre
Waters blocked Greg Cater’s punt
four plays earlier.

Stallings said the decision to use
Stoudt stemmed from Lomax’s lack-
luster first two quarters.

tion. It was time to make a change,”
he said. ’’It wasn't all (Lomax’s) fault.
There were some dropped passes.”

Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan
thought his team’s poor effort in the
fourth quarter determined the out-
come more than Stoudt.

”Defensively, we have to make the
big plays. We had (Green) doubled,
and then he caught a touchdown
pass and that opened the floodgates,”
Ryan said. ”We changed the com-
plexion of the game. We didn’t play
good enough Lg-_beat them.”

Still, the Eagles would have
prevailed had not Gregg Garrity been
dragged down at St. Louis’ 2 at the
final gun by Cards cornerback Cedric
Mack's tackle.

’’I thought I could score. We were
tryingéto get in field goal range, and

I was trying to get as far as I could,’’
said Garrity, the receiver of Ron
Jaworski’s pass on a 34-yard play.
”lt’s hard for our team, because we
know we shou|d’ve won.”

Philadelphia, while restricting its
opponent to 79 of its 190 total yards
in the first half, had taken a 7-0 lead
on rookie Charles Crawford's 1-yard
touchdown dive in the first quarter.

Lomax, who was heavily booed,
completed only seven of his 16 pass-
es for 47 yards during the opening 30
minutes. -Wfterward, Stoudt hit on
seven of 10 for 54 yards to help St.
Louis offset Jaworski’s 174 passing
yards for the Eagles. ,

For the moment, at least, Stoudt’s
performance in helping the Cards
climb to 2-7 and drop the Eagles to
3-6 apparently resolved St. Louis’
budding crisis at his position.

”He did a good job for us. I don’t
care how he got it done,” Stallings
said of Stoudt, a former Pittsburgh
Steelers and Birmingham Stallions
field general. ’'’I’m not sure that I
mind having a quarterback crisis.
When you're 1-7, you'needito do
something.”

Penguins
earn tie

at Chicago,
3-3  

ST. LOUIS (AP) — Pittsburgh Pen-
guins scoring sensation‘ Mario
Lemieux, off to a red-hot start in the
1986-87 NHL season, would prefer
to talk about the success of his
teammates.

The tall center scored a power-play

goal at 6:45 of the third period to lift ’

the Penguins to a 3-3 tie with the St.
Louis Blues Saturday night.

The goal was Lemieux’s 16th of the
season. He has scored at least one
point in all of Pittsburgh's 12 games
and at least one goal in 11 of those
games.

’’I haven't been thinking about it
too much," he said about the scor-
ing streak. ”Tonight’s was a big goal
because it gave us a tie on the road.
We're playing good hockey. That
counts above everything else.”

Lemieux praised the play-making
of his linemate, Kevin Lavallee, for
his goal. ”Kevin made a great pass,”
he said. ”He made it easy for me. He
made the play.” '

The tie broke a two—game losing
streak for the Penguins, 8-3-1. St.
Louis is .500 at 3-3-3. The two teams
played a scoreless five-minute over-
time period. ’

Bernie Federko, Doug Wickenheis-
er and Mark Hunter scored goals for
St. Louis. Dan Frawley and Dave
Hannan also scored for Pittsburgh.

Frawley gave Pittsburgh a 1-0 lead
at 7:25 of the first period when his
short wrist shot hit St. Louis goalie
Greg Millen in the chest, bounced
back onto the ice, and into the net.
Hannan scored just 30 seconds later
for a 2-0 Pittsburgh lead.

Federko narrowed the margin to
2-1 at 1:14 of the second period. The
St. Louis center took a pass from
Mark Reeds behind the Pittsburgh
net, circled to the ‘right, and beat
goalie Gilles Meloche with a back-
hander.

T-he goal made Federko the Blues’
all-time leading goal scorer with 293,
breaking Garry Unger’s record. Fed-
erko is already the Blues’ all—time
leader in points and assists.

Wickenheiser beat Meloche with
a 20-foot slapshotat 17:15 of the se-
cond period on a St. Louis power
play to tie the score. Hunter gave the
Blues a 3-2 lead at 4:26 of the final
period.

The Pitt Panther soccer team got
back on the winning track Saturday
afternoon by beating Big East rival
Villanova 2-0. .

“This was the best game we have
played in a while,” said Pitt coach Joe
Luxbacher. ’’I think our guys really

4 wanted it.”

When the teams came out for the
first half, they bothlooked like they
wanted a win. The Panther offense
looked to be back in their early sea-
son form as they drove down the
field. But the Wildcats were also fired
up and stopped them cold.

Villanova took over the ball and

- started to move down the field. The

Panther defense was just as -stingy
and turned them away. This ex-
change continued for most of the
half. Whenever either team would
manage to get in close, the goalies
would pick up where the defense left
off. It didn't seem like anyone would
score.

With 30 minutes left in the half, the
Panthers mounted another attack.
They stole the ball from the Wildcats
and hit their passes perfectly. A cou-
ple of _minutes later, Dan Liberati
ended up with a penalty shot. Three
defensive players lined up in a wall
five yards from the ball. Liberati
kicked it over the defense and
through the outstretched arms of
Wildcat goalie Brendon Quinn to
give Pitt the lead 1-0.

"This is the first time in a while that

our hearts were really into the game,”
said Panther Jeff Vargas.

The rest of the first half was a hard-
fought battle. Both offenses were
playing well, and the defenses were
playing equally as well. The half
ended with Pitt clinging to its one-
goal lead.

The second half started a bit more
slowly. The offenses seemed to be
just kicking the ball back and forth.
They were almost giving the ball to
the other team. Then with 17 minutes
left, Villanova came alive. The Wild-
cats moved down the field and

faked Panther goalie Mark Hendricks

out of the play and had an open net.

’’It was an even game,” said Vil-

difference was the goal keeping. He
[Hendricks] is probably the best
goalie we have faced all year.”

The game then reverted to a mir-
ror image of the first half. Both teams
were playing well, but neither could

:score. Then with 7:17 left in- the
game, Villanova broke through and
put the ball into the net. This would
have tied the game, but the players
hadn't heard the referee blowing the
play dead. A sigh of relief came from
Pitt players and fans as the Panthers
held on to their one-goal lead.

With three minutes left, Pitt started
to move down the field. They
cracked the defense, and Liberati put

-Villanova opened up their offense
in hopes of scoring. They couldn't do

More importantly, Villanova was
the first Big East team that the Pan-
thers have beaten this season. This
puts Pitt in the running for a bid to
the Big East tournament. ”Whether
or not we make the tournament is
academic,” said Luxbacher. ”Our

a lot of character". I'm proud either

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

Jackie and David Hammond have
quickly become accustomed to com-
ing to Pitt Stadium to cheer on the

72,-‘. University of Pittsburgh soccer team.

As a matter of fact, they have made
it a family affair. Two of their four
children, David and Alicia, are usual-
ly on hand to help their parents yell
support for their brother Bryan, a
freshman midfielder for the Panthers.

With a stadium blanket, a thermos
of coffee and a bag of popcorn in
tow, the Hammonds are always
ready for a game and looking forward
to a Panther win. Well, almost al-
ways, that is.

The Hammonds, who are from
Washington, Pa., will have a slight
conflict on their hands when Pitt
plays Indiana University of Pennsyl-
vania on Tuesday, Nov. 4 at Pitt

  

29!,’ Todd Hammond

 

Stadium. While they want Bryan to
do well, it will be difficult forthem
to voice their support for Pitt. You
see, another member of the Ham-
mond family, Todd, is a junior at IUP
and will be going up against his
brother for the first time ever.

”No matter what happens, I am a
winner,” their father commented.
”Win, lose or draw, I still win.”

”l know I'm going to be real quiet
during the game,” commented Mrs.
Hammond. ”l’m anxious but appre-
hensive about it. It will be difficult.”

One thing that does make them
happy is that the two will not be go-
ing head-to-head due to the positions
they play. They may fight for the ball
here and there, but it will not be a

constant battle for the two.

While the game is causing tension
for the parents, it is just another game
for the two who will be playing, or
so they say. But deep down, they
both want to win.

”Todd has already started joking
with me about it,” Bryan said. ”Don’t
let him kid you, he wants to win. I
know he will rub it in, in a joking
way, if IUP wins. I'll do the same if
we win, though. It will be a fun type
of teasing.”

While the Hammonds don't want
the game to be an intense rivalry for
the two, they are also looking for-

" ward to the teasing that will go on be-

tween the two brothers.

”They’ve talked about it a little,”
Mr. Hammond said. ’’I think it is
probably more important for Bryan.
Whoever wins, at Christmas time
there will be a lot of agitation.”

Pitt is currently 8-5-2, while lUP is
5-6-2. It is a big game for both teams,

as it is the last of the season. They
played last year to a 1-1 deadlock,
and both are hoping this year's game
will produce a winner.

”What we have to do is forget
about what happened and think
about what will happen,” Bryan said.
”We need to play every game as it
comes. I really want to win this
game.”

His older brother feels the same
way. «’’I hope we win,’_’ said Todd,
who has been hampered by injuries
this season. ’’I more or less have to
think of it as just another game. It will
be fun playing against him, though.”

The two have played soccer togeth-
er for about nine years and have real-
ly helped each other along the way.
This is the first time that they will not
be pulling forthe other.

”lt’s going to be different,” Bryan
said. ”l’ve played with him for so
long. I think we will go hard against
each other, though. Todd and my dad
have really helped me with soccer.
I used to tag along with [Todd] when
he would go to tournaments, and
sometimes i would get to play. Most-

L ly, though, I only went to watch

him.”

While the Hammonds claim that
they are going to be quiet during the
game, Bryan has his doubts about his
father.

”He likes the competition,” Bryan
said. ’’I think he will yell for both of
us and for both teams. He is just hap-
py to see us both playing.”

And so will all of the fans from
Trinity High School. You can be sure
there will be a crowd on hand to
cheer for their hometown favorites.

Swimmers open season with win over Duquesne 

By Christopher Sepesy
Staff Writer

Boththe Pitt men's and women's
swim teams are again off to a good
start, after they both captured strong
victories Saturday against Duquesne

' at Trees Pool.

The men's team scored a total of
113 points over Duquesne’s 89 in 14
meet events, while the Lady Panthers
scored 118 points to Duquesne’s 81,
also in 14 events.

Pitt men's coach Fred Lewis said he

feels very surprised’ by the actual.

swimming at the meet, but was very
happy with the outcome.

”What we see now is that,

l although we know we're good swim-

mers, we still have a lot of work to
do,” said Lewis. ”This type of meet
is a very good way to show us we still
need to learn a lot.’’

Meanwhile Panther women's
‘coach David Belowich is also very
happy with the victory, but feels his
swimmers have room for im-
provement.

”This kind of meet is very good in
the fact that it shows good swimmers
how they stand up with their compe-
tition,” said Belowich. ’’Overall, I am
very pleased with the swimming to-
day. We swam a lot faster than I ex-
pected us to, and most of all, the
cohesion between the girls is out-
standing.”

The idea of team cohesion is one
aspect both coaches stress. This was

  THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November 3, 1986

 

the first meet of the season and the
first time the freshmen membersof
the team were involved in college
competition. The coaches said they

« did not know just how each team
would jell.

’’l was worried at first, but by the
way the team showed itself today, I
now know I have nothing to worry
about,” said Belowich. ”Most people
think of swimming as an individual’s
sport, but it really isn't. When you are
on a team, you represent not only
yourself, but your teammates as well.
The teams today showed wonderful
cohesion, and as the meets progress,
it will get stronger.”

Many freshmen members did very
well in the meet, including men's
team member Tim Adams, who

. placed first in both the 50-meter
freestyle and the 200-meter individu-
al medley, and women's team mem-
bers Pam Murphy, first in the
200-meter butterfly. Also, Laurie
Walczak placed first in the 50-meter
freestyle, and Josette Prosser came in
first as a member of the 200-meter
medley relay.

One of the reasons for such strong
freshman showings is the coaches’
choice not to put upperclassmen in
their strongest events. 1

”When you do something like this,
it preserves the swimmers’ energies
so they will do better against the
stronger teams,” said Lewis. ”Our
best swimmers should be very hun-
gry now for next week.” -

Next week both teams travel to
meet Kent State.

Volleyball team just Can't beatthe Nittany Lions

By Kelley Butt
Staff Writer

”We played very well. I saw a
lot of progress,” stated Pitt's wom-
en's volleyball coach Shelton Col-
lier following a disappointing loss
to arch-rival Penn State.

The Lady Panthers, now 24-9,
finished second to host Nittany
Lions at the Penn State Classic.

Friday night, Pitt easily handled
Virginia Commonwealth, winning
15-1 0, 15-2 and ,1 5-1 2. The Tem-
ple Owl-s were next in line to fall
to the Lady Panthers in three
games 15-4, 15-9 and 15-4.

Lady Panther freshmen Kelly
Matheis and Lori Silk filled in for
regulars Denise Frawley and Lisa
S_t§w_art in the matches against

“I'm so depressed. It was my brother’s birthday
last night and I was in charge of making the cake.

VCU and Temple.

These wins were more impor-
tant because any time freshmen
can replace starters and still come
up with the win, it is the mark of
a strong team. ‘

Frawley and Stewart were out
due to injuries incurred at the Ten-
nessee Classic last week. They re-
mained on the bench until the
Penn State match.

”Denise and Lisa missed the en-
tire week of practice,” said Col-
lier. ”By holding them outof the
first two matches, we hoped they
would be back to full strength for
the Penn State match.”

Apparently this move paid off.
Frawley led the Lady Panthers
with 19 kills against the national-
lv ranked Nittany Lions.

“Well, I made the cake, a great bigtriple—fudge

layer cake and before it even got a chance to cool, ‘

I ate the whole thing plus an entire can of fudge-

swirl icing. I ate the Very Vanilla ice-cream, too, -

a gallon of it.

“Of course, I felt bad about the cake, but it's no-

big deal about the calories. I just made myself barf

the whole thing up.

“The party was awful. . .one of our family’s
famous get—togethers, and of course I ate like a pig,
so I had to make myself throw up again. I took a
handful of laxatives, too. It’s funny. My family

Senior captain Sue Hoover led
Pitt with 33 kills for the entire
tournament.

Pitt and Penn State clashed for
the third and final time of the sea-
son Saturday night. The Nittany

At one point during
the middle of the
match we «outscored
Penn State 34-13. We
were just. unable to
con vert that into wins.

Lions emerged on top with a 3-1
victory.

The Lady Panthers, off stride at
first, lost 4-15 in the opening
game. Penn State appeared to be
running away with -the win during
the second game.

At one point Pitt was trailing‘

3-14. However, the Lady Panthers’

battled to 11-14 before losing the
game. Coach Collier noted,
”Freshmen Lori Silk, Denise
[Frawley] and Lisa [Stewart] all did
an excellent job in the comeback
bid."

The third game of the match be-
longed to Pitt as it took over and
dominated Penn State 15-6. The
momentum had swung, and the
Lady Panthers were looking for a
comeback sweep. In the fourth

game, Pitt raced to an .1 1-6 edge

but stalled in its comeback drive, ‘

losing the game 15-12 and also
the match.

The Lady Panthers had a legiti-
mate chance to beat Penn State.
”At one point during the middle
of the match, we outscored Penn

were just unable to convert that

into wins.”
