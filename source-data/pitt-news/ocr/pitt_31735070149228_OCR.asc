Staﬁ" Writer

After eight straight days of evacu-
ations, Pitt students adjusted to a
change in routine Tuesday: no bomb_
threats. '

Fortheﬁrsttime sinceApril1, Pitt
did not receive abomb threatfor more
than 24 hours. Since mid—February,
the campus has been hit with 57
threats — a trend that.culminated
Monday in 12 threats, the highest
number of bomb threats received in
one day. t I

Pitt spokespersonjohn Fedele said
that the police have yet to make an
arrestinthe case, despite widespread
rumors on campus and on the Inter-
net that they have‘.

Pitt police and other investigating
bodies declined to comment on the
investigation._ . ‘

On campus, tensions remained
high.

“Honestly, I’m more paranoid
without a bomb threat than with a
bomb threat,” sophomore Amy Moli-
toris said. -

Pitt heightened security Monday,
requiring students, faculty and staff to
present Pitt IDs and have their bags
searched before entering dn—campus
buildings. Students can also no lon-
ger sign non—Pitt students into their
dormitories. V

Robert_Hill, a University spokes-'
man, said that the increased safety
measures will continue despite the
abatement of alarms .

“The restricted—building-access
program continues indeﬁnitely,” Hill
said. “An active investigation contin-
ues tojdentify and bring to justice the

They took turns speaking,
starting at ‘6 p.m., and read
Scripture from pocket Bibles
and smart phones.

Pittjunior.Anthony Bilan said
that he originally invited three
peopleto the vigil, but when

"he later checked the Facebook

event page, he saw that the guest
list had quickly expanded.

Bilan doesn’t belong to a
Christian group on campus and
said he does not have the time to
attend church regularly.

“For me, Christianity is a
very personal thing,” Bilan said.

Rick Santorum, former Pennsylvania
senator and Pitt alumnus, announced
the suspension of his campaign for the
presidency Tuesday. -

In a message on his website, Santorum
thanked his supporters for their dona-

tions and prayers and asked for one last i

monetary donation. Santorurn’s state-
ment said that he did not want to hurt his
party’s chances of takingback the White
House in November. '

“I do not see a path forward that does

not risk our shared’ objective of defeating —

Barack Obama in November,” the state-
ment said.

Recent polls had shown Republican
front-runner Mitt Romney catching up to
Santorum in Pennsylvania, and Santorum
noted the spending gap between him and

Santorum suspends campaign

the former Massachusetts governor.

' “We have been outspent in most states
5-1 or even-10-1. And we still won, or we’ve
come incredibly close,” the statement
said. V

Pennsylvania’s Republicans are set to
Vote on Tuesday, April 24, but without
Santorum in the race, the election will
be all but irrelevant.

The Republican Partyof Pennsylvania
also weighed in on Santorum’s announce-

“For 16 years, Rick Santorum repre-
sented the Commonwealth of Pennsylva-
nia with honor and distinction as a mem-

. ber of the U.S. House of Representative

and the U.S. Senate. He was a leader on
national issues and won the respect of Re-
publicans, Democrats and Independents
as a fierce advocate and someone who
fervently advocated for Pennsylvanians,”

MEN’S BASKETBALL

 Pitt recruit Robinson

to bring leadership

By Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

James R0binson’s favorite mem-
ory from his high school career
isn’t ‘one of the hundreds of
points he scored or a perfectly
placed pass.

It’s not when he learned of his
four—star ranking and placement
as the No. 10 point guard and No.
58 player in his class. He didn’t
immediately recall a personal ac-
colade or the day he committed
to play at Pitt. if _

Instead, he thought of a mo-
ment from -his freshman season
when a teammate made a game-
winning layup that earned the
first of three consecutive confer-
ence championships for DeMatha
High School in Maryland, where
Robinson is now known asthe
team’s most important player.

He could’ve focused on the two
key jump shots he made down
the stretch that gave his team a
one—point lead twice.

, But he didn’t_.

That unselfishness — that
steady focus on the success of the
team — is a quality that DeMatha
head coach Mike Jones said will
make the point guard a success
at Pitt.

Next year, Robinson will join
the Pitt men’s basketball team
as part of an incoming class that
includes five-star center Ste-
ven Adams and shooting. guard
Chris Jones. Junior Trey’Zeigler,

a transfer from Central Michi-

gan, will also join’ the team next
season.

Robinson started playing var-

sityibasketball as a freshman — a
rarity at a high profile basketball
school like DeMatha — and won
three consecutive Washington
Catholic Athletic Conference
championships. Next year, he’ll

'play Division I basketball at

Pitt.

“He could score 20 points
a night,” Jones said. “He could
dominate the basketball. He

could take a shot every time down '

the courtif he wanted to  A lot
of times, when guys get to decide
who shoots it, they’ll call their
own number. James doesn’t do

that.”

He was a freshman when that
layup went in and, in the words of
Jones, tended to defer to the older
members of the team. Now, fel-
low senior Kameron Taylor said
that the team’s play grows hectic
when Robinson isn’t on the floor
for the Stags. .

At 6—foot-3 and 195 pounds,
Robinson is a strong and broad-
shouldered true point guard. He
has a knack for using his strength
and speed for bursting past de-
fenders to get to the basket,

where he either finishes with a '

layup or finds an open teammate
with a well—placed pass.

 Finding h_is way to Pitt

, Pitt originally started recruit-
ing-Robinson when the guard was
in ninth grade, but his primary

recruiter-, former assistant coach ,

Pat Skerry, left to become the
head coach at”Towso‘n last yeaf.
Robinson said that Pitt head
coachjamie Dixon became more
involved with his recruitment af-
ter Skerry’s departure. Although
he was disappointed he wouldn’t

get to play under Skerry, Rob-.
inson’s solid relationship with a
‘Dixon helped solidify his decision-

to commit to Pitt.. . ‘

He can recall the moment he ’

knew he wanted to come play
basketball in Pittsburgh. He’d
finished his official visit and was
driving home with his parents
when the desire to be a partof the
team simply struck him.

“I was just like, ‘I could get
used to that,’” he said. “I really
enjoyed my time on campus-.'Be—
ing with the team and the coach-
es, I really got a good vibe.”

Pitt’s winning mentality was
a draw for a player as team-ori-
ente'd as Robinson. When he vis-
ited, the current members of the
team talked about how hard they
wanted to work to be successful,
and Robinson wanted to be a part
of that future.

He was also impressed -with

the ability of the coaching staff
to develop players‘, pointing to
senior guard Ashton Gibbs who

SOFTBALL

Young pitches

Pitt freshman pitcher Savannah King ranks near the top ofthe Big East with a .1.s4.lrJl<A.

By RJ Sepich
Staﬁ Writer

With a contagious smile and .an
easygoing personality, Savannah
King grew up just a few miles away
from the Paciﬁc Ocean and the
Disneyland Resort near Ana-
heim, Calif. Tall and athletic, she
dreamed of playing softball at an
Ivy League college.

. Meanwhile, Alexa Larkin’s
softball career started more

‘ modestly.

The left-handed Latrobe High
School graduate dominated the
comparatively less competitive

landscape of high school softball .

in southwestern Pennsylvania for
four years before deciding to play
collegiately in her home city.
While King and Larkin have
taken significantly different
paths to Pitt,. the two freshmen
pitchers now share the same goal:

to help Pitt softball become‘ one .

  

of the best teams in the country
over the next four years.‘

Panthers head coach Holly

Aprile, who took over leadership
of the team in 2008 and has had
the program steadily improving

. since, believes King and Larkin

have the ability to take Pitt soft-
ball to new heights;
- ,“Together, they’re a pretty sol-

id foundation for our program,”
Aprile said. “An_d if they can con— .

tinue to-learn and get better, they
can help us take that step to the
next level.” I I
For a program that only start-
ed in 1999 and has now recorded
four consecutive winning seasons,
that next level would be legiti-
mately competingfor conference
and national championships. ‘
King, 18, believes that having
lofty goals is important but add-
ed that the Panthers cannot take
shortcuts if they want to fulfill
their ambitions. ”
. “We want to take this program
as, far as we possibly can,”.she

shi for Panther  

Cou esy Pitt Alll

  

said. “But it’s a game—by—'game
process of getting better every
day in order to reach those ulti-
mate goals.” _

Having grown up over 2,000
miles apart, the two girls said

i that therewas one common de-

nominator in the pair ending up
at Pitt: Aprile. ‘
“Being from southern Califor-

nia, Pitt ‘isn’t really well known,

but I knew Coach through email-

ing, and she was awesome,” King if
‘said. “I would say that we’re both

really close with her.”

Larkin, 19, agreed and said
that Aprile’s personality made her '
decision to come to'Pitt easy.

V “Coach;-Iolly andIwere‘email- 

ing back and forth for awhile be-
fore I decided to come here. She
was very personable and friendly,
and she only made me want to
come to Pitt more,” Larkin said.

However, the similarities in
King’s and Larkin’s paths to Pitt

‘end there.

GREGORIAN RANTS

Hockey teams’ reputations
can be misleading

By Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

Every hockey fan knows that the Wash-
ington Capitals have a lethal offense and
that the Nashville Predators win because

of strong defense and goaltender Pekka .
— Rinne.

Except only ﬁve playoff teams scored
less in the regular season than Washing-
ton, and Nashville had a goal-scoring rate
comparable to those of Detroit and Chi-
cago while ﬁnishing among the bottom
half of playoff teams in goals against.

Teams have stereotypes: “high-flying”
Washington,‘ “tough” Philadelphia‘ and
“anemic” Nash-

two goals per game in the regular season,
a feat unseen since the lockout. Both their
goalies (Brian Elliott andjaroslav Halak)
ﬁnished in the top ﬁve league-wide in
shutouts and goals-against average.

But the Blues aren’t an especially tal-
ented team, and head coach Ken Hitch-
cock’s defensive system usually earns
more praise than Elliott and Halak. First-

roundopponent San Jose, loaded with '

skill, is a trendy pick to upset the Blues,
although the Sharks will have to win at
least one game in the Sco_ttrade Center

his freshman season to an All—Big East
performer.

Although the Panthers struggled this
season, ﬁnishing with just ﬁve Big East
wins and missing both the NCAA and
NIT tournaments to play in the College
Basketball Invitational, Robinson said he
believes" the team members played as hard
as they could.

“Obviously, the results weren’t there
like a lot of people expected, but I think
they will learn something from it, and next
year they will pretty much know what they
have to do,” he said.

Jones called Robinson’s style of play a
perfect fit for the Pitt program, describing
himas a “physical, tough-nosed guard.” He
compared Robinson’s stature to those of
former Pitt point guards Carl Krauser and
Levance Fields —— who were both known
for their physical strength and toughness
— but with more height.

“Ijust think he’s the kind of tough, blue
collar, ‘‘I’m going to bring my lunch pail
and go to work”-type player that Coach

Dixon has had a lot of success v'vith,”Jones

said. “James is the epitome of that.”.
Coming in as a leader

Robinson attributes his hard-working

' nature and leadership abilities to his par-

ents, saying he lives by his father’s motto to
stay humble and hungry. When-he doesn’t
have a good game, his parents are there to
tell him to battle back and keep working.

He took that guidance and transferred
it to his teammates. He shows his true lead-

ership abilities after losses, when Taylor ‘

said he is the player in the locker room
making sure the team stays together and
telling his teammates to come back harder
in the next game. ,

Robinson said he’lldo whatever is nec-
essary for his team to win, whether that
means involving his teammates, taking a
charge or diving on the ﬂoor for a loose
ball.

“I try to play under control as well as I
can,” he said. “Unselﬁsh, but if there are
times when I need to assert myself more,

then I can do that. I try to stay calm as »

possible and be an extension of the coach
on the court.” ’ ~

Robinson has always been a hard work-
er, Taylor said, calling the point guard
the team’s “role model.” Even when the
players are exhausted, Robinson is the
team member who keeps pushing them
in practice. ‘ ,

He began his high school career as a
shooting guard while waiting for his turn
to take over the team. _Now, he has a com-
manding and dominating presence on the
court,Jones said, and puts his teammates

in -the position to do what he wants them

to do.
Off the court,Jones called Robinson laid

back and quiet, although not shy -— a man ’'

who doesn’t have to talk much, but is still
the “alpha dog in the room.”

“He’s the one everybody watches for
‘What is James doing? How is James behav-
ing? How is James reacting?”’Jones said.

He’s the player who shows up in the gym
in the morning before school and stays
after practice to put up extra shots. Jones
stressed that in Robinson’s case, “hard
worker” isn’t just a phrase.

AndJones has complete faith that Rob- ‘

inson will be able to excel at the collegiate
level, both in the Big East Conference and
then the Atlantic Coast Conference when
Pitt makes the move. Jones laughed, say-
ing that he didn’t mean to sound arro-
gant when he said Robinson didn’t need

to improve in order to perform well in
college.

“He’s already got the brain for it,” Jones
said. “A lot of guys, physically they need
to get stronger, but he doesn’t need to do
that  He already has the work ethic that
it’s going to take to be successful.”

Robinson likes to joke around and is
quick with a laugh, _but he knows when
it’s time to be serious. He’s found that line
in between the two extremes of fun and
hard work that Jones said is so difficult
for young men to walk. ;

“I think the other guys look at him as a
very talented basketball player who gets
good grades and doesn’t get in troubleand
carries himself the way he’s supposed to,”

Jones said.

Robinson is excited to have the oppor-
tunity to carry on the point guard tradition
at Pitt that began with current assistant
coach Brandin Knight, who starred at Pitt
from 1999 to 2oo3.

Next year, he’ll have the chance to learn
from Knight and current point guard Tra-
Von Woodall. He’s said he’s looking forward
to learning everything they have to teach
him, both on and off the court.

“I think I am going to be a guy who
will do whatever it takes for us to win,”
Robinson _said. “I’ll' go as hard as I can
in practice, try to lead as much as I can
and try to learn from everyone else who
is already there.” 3 '

were all Pitt fans, so I decided to vi__sit here
and fell in love with the school and the
city,” she said. “It’s perfect for me because
I get to be in the city, but I’m still close ,to_
home._So it’s pretty much a match made
in heaven for me.” 1 . '

With the pitching duo now a few months
into their Pitt careers, Aprile said that hav-
ing an experienced catcher like junior Holly
Stevens behind the plate to work with King
and Larkin has eased the pair’s transition
to-the next level. '

“Our upperclassmen have been really
supportive of them, and especially Holly
[Stevens] behind the plate has done really
well with both of them,’.’ Aprile said.

Stevens said that having two lock—down
pitchers like King and Larkin also helps the
Panthers relax ‘offensively because they
know a few runs are all they need to win
most games. = ‘ '

‘?\ll we ask of them is to consistently
get outs and keep it close,”-she said. “We-
know we aren’t the strongest hitting team,
but we’re still capable of pushing a few runs
across if they can keep us in games.”.

Knowing that the future of-the program

' relies heavily on their arms, ‘both pitchers

— who also ‘live together as suite mates
— said that having a good relationship
and learning from each other has helped
them improve. ' i . .
“Even though we’re different, we still
realize we’re in the same position of being
a freshman pitcher coming in and needing
to step our game up,” Larkin said. “We

know that we’re there for each other and _‘

will support each other.”l 5 .

King also said that the entire freshman
class, which consists of seven girls from
across the country, has developed a good
relationship that should last for the next
four years.’ , '  . .

“All of the freshmen" hang out alot,” she
said. “We see each other all of the time,-and
we are really close.” , of

King, Larkin and rest of the freshmen
want to help the Pitt program move for-
ward during their four years as Panthers.

“We want to take it all theway,” King K

said with a smile. I
