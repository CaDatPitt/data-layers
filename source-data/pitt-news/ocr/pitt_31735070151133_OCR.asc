PKP wins
bid to  

negotiate

for house

Em Maier
Staff Writer

Although the details aren’t yet ﬁnal-
ized, the brothers of Pi Kappa Phi
have a chance to have their own on-
campus fraternity house.

This upcoming fall, the former

fraternity house ofDelta Sigma Delta, .

a dental studentorganization, might
be inhabited by the newcomer to
Pitt’s Greek community. Both Pi

_Kappa Phi and Phi Delta Theta made

bids this fall for a recommendation

to receive the house, and PKP came,

away victorious. » ,
Although the brothers still need
to negotiate withthe University’s De-

, partmentofHousingforaprice,win-

ning the bidwas a major step for the
fraternity toward earning that Greek
life staple — the fraternity house.

“[Formerpresident] Sean [Zajdel]
said it best during our presentation
with the University: ‘We just want a
place to call home,”’ said current PKP
president Braxton Ambrose.

But Pitt spokesman John Fedele
and Ambrose both stressed that the
situation is tentative.

“The fraternity did not ‘win abid
to the house.’ The bidding process

, was to be recommended to the De-

partment of Housing to negotiate a
potential fraternity house opening.
This is only a negotiation process.
There is no guarantee,” Fedele said.

In 2010, Zajdel met with Am-
brose to talk about the return of the
Pi Kappa Phi fraternity to Pitt’s cam-

Monday despite a nasty case of

After a weekend of feverish
bedrest,;she was ready for some
sort of relief.

symptoms, to Nguyen, but upon
arriving at the Student Health
Pharmacy she found there was
no more left. Staff there referred
Nguyen to CVS, but the store was
also out of Tamiﬂu.

“I just had a lot of rest and or-
ange juice,” Nguyen said. “I took
over-the-counter medicine.”

In the midst of a particularly

nasty flu season, health provid-

ers across the country are expe-
riencing a shortage of Tamiﬂu,
and Pitt’s_ Student Health Center
is no exception.

Last Friday, Pitt Student
Health only received four doses

of Tamiﬂu, an antiviral medica-
tion used to prevent and treat
influenza. ‘

“There are sporadic short-
ages being seen throughout the
country,” Director of Student
Health Services Marian Vanek
said in an email. “Our distribu-
tors are being very careful with
allotments. For example, we or-
dered 10 doses but only received
4 doses.”

So far this season, Student
Health diagnosed approximate-
ly 78 cases of influenza-like ill-
nesses.

“Note,” Vanek said in her

email, “that we do not test for_

influenza, and therefore do not
have supporting data, and make
the diagnosis based on a patient’s
history and physical examina-
ﬁon?

But, Vanek said, not all stu-
dents experiencing ﬂu—like symp-
toms need Tamiﬂu. The medica-
tion only works within 48 hours
of infection and often infections
aren’t severe enough that treat-
ment is vital.

Nguyen, for one, is feeling a
lot better and only missed Mon-

pus. PKP previously had a Pitt chapter between
1978 and 2003, before the group surrendered
its charterbecause of sinking membership and
rising debt, according to a2o11 Pitt News article.
Ambrose, afreshman at the time, was doubtful
of Zajdel’s plan.

“The next day he showed up with a note-

began the application process forahouse. Both
fraternities created a packet containing bylaws,
aﬁnancial plan for house payment, an essay and
other information. The process culminated in
a presentation by each president.

“The bid packets were reviewed and evalu-
ated by a selection committee composed of
staff from the Department of Housing, the Divi-
sion of Student Affairs and Student Conduct,”
Fedele said.

from two to eight, then to 20, and in the blink

to 80 brothers in the spring of 2012,” Ambrose
said.

PKP, though still new on campus, is no new-
born when it comes to accomplishments. In the
past few years they’ve completed two major
philanthropic projects: the armual Bike-A-Thon
for Push America and the Michelle Zajdel But-
terﬂy Project, which sets up a scholarship for
new students.

“The amazing part of it is we were able to
accomplish all of this by holding our chapter
meetings at random times in random locations
throughout campus,” Ambrose said.

on gettingaPitt home for more than ﬁve years.
“We are very happy for the Pi Kappa Phi fra-

For better or forworse, ‘PDT is not alone. Of
the 19 ﬁaternities listed as members of the Pitt
Interfraternity Council, only nine have homes
on campus. The others are scattered in private
residences across North and South Oakland.

Ambrose is excited for his fraternity’s future

We won’t go back: A reﬂection on

 

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

Let me take you on atrip. You are
a female Pitt student, and the year
is 1970.

The Roe v Wade decision hasn’t
been made yet, and although 95 per-
cent of Americans at the timeengage
in sexbefore marriage, birth control
is taboo. You and the others in.Hol-
land Hall have a curfew — although
your male classmates don’ —— but its
effectiveness is belied by the number
of girls who drop out because of un-
intended pregnancies.

Student Health Services doesn’t
prescribe birth control, but if you un-

I intentionally get pregnant, you can

appeal to the Student Government

Boardforaloan to payforanabortion _

and the cost of travelingto New York,
where the procedure is legal.

If you don’t have the time or re-
sources to travel, or if the idea of ask-
ing SGB foran abortion loan horriﬁes

THE RIVETER

you — as it might horrify any student
who’s ever had a rough Allocations
meeting — you have another option.
If you know somebody who’s well-
connected, such as Deborah Hetrick
Catanese, a197o Pitt alumna and one
of the activists who spoke to me for
this story, you might hear aboutadoc—
tor who performs abortions illegally.
Sometime in the evening, some-
one like Deborah — who went on
after Roe ‘v. Wade to work for a Pitts-
burgh clinic called Women’s Health
Services and prides herself on the
standard of care that clinic provided
——  you to a" hotel'Downtown.
Youﬂlmeethiminthe parkinglot and
pay  $350 incash. You willhave
heard horror storiesof women who
bled to death inhotel rooms like this
one,  what you’re doing. But if
you havea baby, you’ll have to drop
out, c oose between a shotgun wed-
ding and the marked life of a single
mother, and you’re simply not ready.
You’re desperate enough to take the

e pre—Roe v. Wade era at Pitt

chance.

Afterward, you’ll bleed heavily
and you won’t have anyone to tell you
whether that’s normal. You’ll wonder
if you’re going to bleed to death, or
if you’re infertile. You won’t have a
follow—up appointment, and because
you and the doctor have both done
somethingi1legal,you’ll be too scared
to go to the emergency room and ask
if you should be bleeding this much.

The girls who went with Deborah
were fortunate. The person they saw
was at least a doctor. They did not
bleed to death. But the important con-
cept to take from;t_:heir stories is the
understanding that when feminists

say “we won’t go%back,” and when

we talk about women  their

As the Super Bowl approaches,
consider the NFL and social change

Rosie McKinley
Columnist

Between Pitt ending its season
in yet another meaningless bowl
game and the Steelers missing the
playoffs, this season was a rough
chapter in Pittsburgh football.
But on a broader level, there
was a sense that this season was
one of progress across the National

Football League.

And the positive changes go far
beyond the transition to sexy Nike
uniforms rather than Reebok. Even
my limited fashion sense tells me
that brand hasn’t been hip since
Allen Iverson’s multimillion-dollar
deal in 2oo1.

’ In three major social catego-
ries — race, gender and sexuality

-— the NFL showed its potential -

to make the gridiron a cannon of

societal change.

As sports history has grown as
an academic ﬁeld — History of
Sports is one of the most popular
courses offered at Pitt —— it isn’t
surprising that a major sporting
industrﬂike the NFL, MLB or NBA
has thepotential to affect social
change. Many historians argue that
it was not mere coincidence that

the 1955 ruling of Brown v. Board l

of Education came only eight years
after baseball’s bold integration
pioneered byjackie Robinson. The
surprise this season is that change
was visible across the league re-
garding an array of social issues.
Six starting quarterbacks were
black, and one ‘of them, Robert
Griffin III, has a legitimate shot at
becoming Offensive Rookie of the
Year. The 49ers’ Colin Kaepernick
—— who is of mixed descent and
was raised by white parents — will

start in Super Bowl XLVII. But per-
haps the more historic story con-
cerning race comes from the least
glorious of positions: the kicker.
For only the fourth time in NFL
history, and the ﬁrst since 2001, a
black person started at the posi-
tion. Yetjustin Medlock’s 23 extra
points for the Carolina Panthers
this season hardly made the head-
lines. And that’s a good thing.
Perhaps what shows our prog-
ress as a nation is that stories of
neither black quarterbacks nor
a black kicker were newsworthy
enough to make headlines at all.
These non-headlines indicate that
the race of our quarterbacks and
kickers alike might ﬁnally become
a non-issue. Panther fans really did
seem to care more about Medlock’s
ability to make ﬁeld goals than they

Fund money to give women safer alternatives.
The pill also existed at the time but was
difficult for a coed to get her hands on. Vicki
Sirockman, another Pitt alumna whom I in-
terviewed, explained how one Holland Hall
resident was engaged and then “donated” her
ring after the engagement was broken off.

“The ring ﬂoated around Holland Hall,
and if you wanted to get birth control, you
would wear it,” shetold me, matter—of-factly.
“You had to play like, ‘I’m getting married in
a few months, I need birth control before my
wedding.’ The doctor hemmed and hawed and
[a ﬂoormate of Vicki’s] really had to fast—talk
 but she got the prescription.”

People who think it was better in those
days are a small minority, but it is foolish and
naive to think that “going back” to pre-Roe V.
Wade America is just a paranoid liberal fear."
We have won victories on the federal level.
Co-pay—free birth control is a big step, though
it only restores progress that was undone in
the last few decades; in the late ’70s and ’8os,
birth control was free at family planning clin-
ics allover the country, no questions asked.
But we are losing traction at the state level.

Sirockman, who worked in family plan-
ning during the early ’8os supervising about
50 clinics, describes how she’s seen funding
and access for family planning’ drop off in the
last three decades. if ‘

“I remember seeing clinics close all down
the road. You really have to travel [to get an

abortion] now. A lot of private doctors used
to do it, but it’s harder for a medical student
to get trained in it now. You really have to
opt in,” she said.

The clinics that are still standing are as
heavily picketed as ever, even if they don’t
perform abortions. Sirockman’s clinics never
performed the procedure, but they were pro-
tested daily for referring patients to providers

who did. Death threats are de rigueur. Mean— -

while, state laws include second—trimester
abortion. bans, mandatory ultrasounds and
biased counseling requirements. There have
also been targeted regulations of clinics, such
as the recently passed Pennsylvania SB 732,
which carries no signiﬁcant safety beneﬁt and
imposes thousands of dollars in additional
costs on abortion providers and patients.
These laws and regulations have made the
legal—in-theory procedure veryrdifﬁcult to
access in practice. For many women seeking
abortions, today’s America resembles the
America Deborah Hetrick Catanese’s scared
college women lived in more than the America
that Vicki Sirockman managed clinics in.
Remember this in the coming week, when
feminists are celebrating and conservatives
are scowling over the 40th anniversary of the
Roe v. Wade decision. The pro—life yearning
for the time beforethat decision is a yearning
for a time when women like you and I risked
their lives to. be able to decide when they had

did about the color of his skin.

Social change on the ﬁeld was not limited
to race. When Shannon Eastin‘ donned the
stripes during the referee strike in the ﬁrst
week of the season, she became the NFL’s
ﬁrst woman to referee a regular—season
game. Since the prospect of a woman play-
ing professionally remains entirely unlikely,
Eastin’s' arrival signals a viable opening of the
ﬁeld to women. Never mind that she received
the opportunity because of a bitter labor
dispute between referees and the league.

Commissioner Roger Goodell stated,
“there are more [women] coming,” indicat-
ing that the role of women as referees won’t
end just because the strike did. And as the
members of a generation of girls who grew
up playing backyard football and learning
the game from PlayStation and endless ver-
sions of Madden reach their 20s and 30s,
Goodell is right to think that there are, in-
deed, more of us coming. V

Yet the most incredible display of the
NFL’s interaction with social change didn’t
happen on the ﬁeld at all. In fact, it happened
where much of today’s social change is dis-
puted: the Internet. In a bold YouTube video,
Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo tack-
led the divisive issue of gay marriage.

In an age of social media, professional
athletes have voiced their opinions on social
issues. The entire Miami Heat team showed
support for Trayvon Martin — the black

I

 

17-year-old who was shot and killed by a
Hispanic man named George Zimmerman
— with a symbolic Twitpic in which they
all wore their hoods up to represent the
supposedly aggressive attire that allegedly
made a teenager seem vicious enough to be
fatally shot.

Ayanbadejo has become an outright sup-
porter of marriage equality in a state that, in
November, became one of only nine states
to allow same—sex marriage.

The linebacker’s remarks drew the ire of

Maryland state delegate Emmett C. Burnsjr.

The delegate wrote to Ravens owner Steve
Bisciotti and explained that many of his
constituents — and Ravens fans — were
“appalled and aghast” that a football player
would try to “sway public opinion one way

i or the other.”

, Burns went further in asking that Bisciotti
take “necessary action” to “inhibit such ex-
pressions” from his players. That’s right:
A state delegate called for the invasion of
Ayanbadejo’s First Amendment rights on the
grounds that he was a professional athlete.
' Minnesota punter Chris Kluwe supported
Ayanbadejo, stating that his “only crime was
speaking out for something he believed in.”
As he prepares for the Super Bowl, Ayan-
badejo’s “crime” of acting for societal change
is one’ that will surely garner the attention
of the national media. Who knew we could
admire our NFL stars for attempting to tackle
far more than just each other, even if they
play for the Ravens? I

“The Following”
Created by: Kevin Williamson
Starring: Kevin Bacon, James

Purefoy, Shawn Ashmore

In “The Following,” a new show created by

Kevin Williamson, a convicted serial killer has .

escaped prison and slaughtered ﬁve guards in
his wake. The killer,_Ioe Carroll (James Purefoy),
is a tall, handsome European man with a men-
acing smirk and ﬁightening eyes who believes
in the beauty of death and the insanity of art.

“To bereave beauty is to elevate one’s soul;
nothing is more beautiful than the death of a
beautiful woman,” Carroll tells one of his vic-
tims (Natalie Zea), who happens to be the only
survivor of the 15 women he assaulted and the
incomplete brushstroke of his masterpiece -
a work that literally demanded he feel his art,
breathe every gory detail and ﬁnd strength in
the ﬁnal weakness of others. '

These words are spoken in a classroom in
2003. But most ofthe showis about the ugliness
of death — its ﬁnality, its unscrupulousness and
its effect on the living.

“The Following” chronicles this ugliness
and the frustration of those who are unable to
conquer it or to defeat those workingas Death’s

proxy. The virtue of “The Following,” however, ‘

isthat each pang of excitement and horrorthere
pays tribute to the reality oflife and the delicacy
of people; it combines ruthlessness and human-

ity and is largely dedicated to confusing the line
between good and evil by making those who
represent their polarity maddeningly complex.

The protagonist of Williamson’s story,
former FBI agent Ryan Hardy (Kevin Bacon),
harbors much of this depth, hidden beneath
the guiseof almost-laughable crime—drama
cliches. Carroll’s escape is a primal moment
for Hardy: It marks the rebirth of his career
because according to an ominous phone call
from the bureau, only Hardy can catch Carroll
— akiller obsessed with the artofhis hero, the
gothic romantic author Edgar Allen Poe.

The ﬂustered and upset look that plagues
Hardy’s face when he ﬁnds out that the FBI
needs his expertise makes it clear that Hardy is
wounded by this serial killer and that revenge
and redemption will be at the forefront of his
chase. _

This wound is both metaphoric and literal:
Hardy was stabbed in the heart and now relies
upon the steady beat of a pacemaker. And the
same knife that wounded him also wounded the
only survivingvictim, symbolizingthe strength
of their connection. It’s as though her death
would somehowcause his because shewas the
only girl he could save and the metaphorical
trophy he ﬂashed to prove it. She is his pace-
maker and his crutch. '

This woman, the only proof of Hardy’s vir-
tue, is lost in the chaos of a murderer and his
followers and is found dead with her eyes ripped
out. Hardy is thrown back into the world ofhis
own defeat, lost love and imperfection. He is
forced to question what separates him from Car-
roll’s followers, what separates him from Carroll
and why he fell in love with the ex-wife (Annie
Parisse) of the man he convicted of murder.
Carroll cannot feel or love as Poe could, yet he

ALBUM REVIEW

Local artist produces mediocre album focused heavily on romance

Sam Bojarski
For The Pitt News _

Brooke Annibale

Words In Your Eyes
Grade: C+

Rocks like: John Mayer

The ﬁrst words in artist Brooke Annibale’s
EP Word; In Your Eye: serve as an accurate
portrayal of the tone present throughout the
rest of the recording: “I wrote these letters
in the dark of night, I lit the paper by the

candlelight.” V
In this release, like in her last one, Pitts-

burgh native Annibale sings almost exclu- .
sively about the intricacies of love and re— *
lationships. However, this time around she _

produces a multi—faceted, ambient sound
with strings, keyboard and guitar. This is a

departure from her last effort, Silence Wm/2 '

Breaking, which was more of a folk-pop effort.

Annibale plays a rich variety of instru-
ments on her latest release: acoustic and
electric guitar, ukulele, piano, tubular bells,
synth bass, marimba and Vibraphone. The
sounds she produces are pleasing to the ear,
but the songs tend to hang over the listener’s
head, unable to be trulycaptured and fully

appreciated. In other words, it’s elevator —

music. -
Annibale’s ﬁrst track, “Silence Worth

Breaking,” begins promising with a nice de-
scending guitar riff and lyrics about writing
a love letter by candlelight. It’s romantic and
haunting at the same time. Interestingly, the
song doesn’t end at all like it begins, neither
lyrically nor musically.

Percussion and a high-pitched, ﬂowing
string arrangement kick in toward the middle
of the song, and the lyrics transform into the
telling of a silence between two lovers that
simply must be broken —— a far cry from
what listeners think they are getting when
the song begins.

The way Annibale utilizes percussion in
“Middle of the Mess” is impressive. She em-
ploys percussion only in the most intense
moments of the song, laying a nice backdrop
for the heartfelt verses. The strings also do a
nice job of accenting the frequent stopping

and starting of the melody.

The lyrics reﬂect a commendable effort,
but it is hard to tell exactly where Annibale is
coming from in this track. In the verses, she
describes the problems she has with her lover
and how she plans on solving them. Inthe
chorus, she appears to accept the fact that she
lives in a mess and say she is OK with being
there. Ambivalence might not be a bad thing
to sing about in a song, but perhaps Annibale
could venture a little deeper lyrically.

“By Your Side” contains by far the catchi-
est, most listener-friendly line of the album,
located in the song’s chorus. The song has
potential, but only contains two verses. It’s
almost as if Annibale knew that the chorus
was the only strong section, so she chose to

Thrilling video game a ‘far cry’ from interesting story line

“Far Cry 3”

Developer: Ubisoft Montreal
Publisher: Ubisoft

Grade: B

Pros: Gameplay freedom,
exhilarating combat, great
stealth elements

Cons: Uninteresting story
and generic characters slow

the pacing of the game

Imagine being stuck on a tropical island with
a lot of guns and the three most annoying
characters from this weekend’s frat party
—— the rich stoner, the valley girl, and the
one who claims to be a hipster, though we

3 all know she really isn’t. Wouldn’t you try

to escape? .

In “Far Cry 3,” developer Ubisoft gives
the player the tools to transcend his humble
college dropout roots and rise to be a para-
gon warrior.

Coming from a lineage of “Far Cry”
games, “Far Cry 3” continues an open-world
formula that creates a spontaneous, exciting
game world for the player to explore. And
this time, the franchise ﬁnally capitalizes
on modern technology and game design to
create a truely thrilling gameplay experience.
However, bland characters and an uninspired
attempt at storytelling hold the game back
from reaching its full creative potential.

The game begins with main character
Jason Brody, his close friends and two broth-
ers on vacation  a tropical paradise. But the
idyllic sceneryaijndjocund times come to a di-
sastrous closewhenjason and his friends are
kidnapped by pirates and held for ransom.

repeat it one—too-many times in the latter
half of the song.

It’s reminiscent of “Wish You Were Here”
by Pink Floyd, but it is tragically short. Great
love songs need words — a lot of honest,
vivid words. {Think Bob Dylan’s “Tangled
Up in Blue.”   .

“You Don_’5tKnow” is the closest Annibale
gets to traditional rock music on this album.

But (of course) Brody escapes and ven-
tures out on an island—wide quest to free his
friends and escape the island.

. “Far Cry 3” displays a_ wide arsenal of
customizable weapons, includesplenty of
vehicles and constantly pushes the player
to explore the vast, open world. The detail
and beauty of “Far Cry 3” is only rivaled by
the critically acclaimed RPG “Skyrim,” and
gamers who feel comfortable in the vast,
open worlds of “Grand Theft Auto IV” and
“Borderlands 2” will feel at home in this ex-
pansive setting. ‘

Despite its scope, “Far Cry 3” also ﬁnds
time for innovation. The open—world dynam-

ics —— exploration leading to encounters,-

whichin turn lead to combat — feel fresh and
natural throughout the game, avoiding the
boredom and repetition that often sets in by
the end of games as large as “Far Cry 3.” The
greatest innovation is the tagging system,
which allows players to use a camera to tag
enemies and monitor opponents’ positions
on his rnini—map. This feature allows,Bro‘dy to
sneak through complex outposts of enemies

Withafull drum set and electric guitar in ad— '

dition to a string arrangement, it deﬁnitely
doesn’t belong in anelevator or hotel lobby.
Annibale’s voice is as equally suited for
rock music as it is for folk—pop, ambient or
any other genre she touches. The electric
guitar leads this song and Annibale does a
great job on the instrument. Her voice lends
the music a mellow ﬂavor that is surprisingly

pleasing. , v_
‘ Annibale demonstrates her lyrical matu-

rity in the title track, “Words-in Your Eyes.”

while setting traps along the way, keeping l

track of his opponents through the entirety
of each mission. A
This feature opens up the wonderful
stealth mechanics of the game. By provid-
ing large bonuses for stealthy behavior, the
game pushes the player to take advantage of
the lush vegetation, silenced weapons and
tagging system. But it never feels like the
game is exclusively based on stealth —— the
player can at any time choose the rocket.

launcher over the silenced sniper riﬂe. This '

overwhelming freedom is exhilarating and

refreshing. “Far Cry 3” wants you, the player,

to be who you want to be. ‘ .
This freedom permeates the entire game,

save one feature: storytelling. The player V

is constantly sent on missions to free_ his
friends from captivity. As the game progress-
es, Brody’s friends notice his slow descent
from innocent 20—something to hardened
killer. Brody is impervious to these concerns,
worriedlmore about revenge on the pirates
and rescuing the friends who barely recog-
nize him.

Looking into another’s eyes may give some-
one more words than actually talking to a
person. This sentiment is what Annibale is
trying to convey through this song, which
displays perhaps her best lyrical work on
the album. '

The ﬁnal track, “Tragically Beautiful,”
contains a nice ukulele arrangement that,
unlike the previous song, actually stands
out. Annibale again displays some of her
lyrical maturity, but the listener will prob-
ably ﬁnish this song wanting more words

But pushed between enthralling action
sequences and a liberating world, the sto-
rytelling seems forced, contrived and un-
interesting. Brody’s friends are unlikable
at best and mind—bogglingly annoying at
worst, boring caricatures of typical college
students. Many times, still ﬂeeing the burn-
ing wreckage of your daring escapes, your
friends berate you for the destruction you’ve
wrought while saving them. Although the
story doesn’t distract too much from the
unbridled. joy of Brody’s descent into generic
video game fun, it does enough to limit the
player’s immersion.

But despite not—so—gently prodding you

along a story that slows down the rest of the .

game, “Far Cry 3” still offers a wealth of free-
dom in gameplay. The game drops you on an
island with some guns, thousands of pirates
trying to kill you and some annoying friends
to save, saying, “Have fun or deal with it.”
For those willing to overlook a lacking plot
for some exhilarating exploration, “Far Cry
3” is an enjoyable tropical jaunt that should
not be missed. I

from the artist. 3. .

Annibale triumphs on more than a few
occasions, but she lacks the ‘ability to make
her songs stand out as separate entities in
and of themselves. The result is songs that

t are aesthetically pleasing at moments, yet not

quite worth listening to from start to ﬁnish.

"And that is the essence of elevator music.

Annibale gives us some fantastic sounds
and even better lyrics on Word: 2% Your Eyes.
However, she is far from producing the type
of music that listeners will be eager to buy.

Every nine minutes, someone in the

Now celebrating its 20th anniversary,
Lifebeat is dedicated to using music as a
meansof reaching the demographic most

lives of young people, Lifebeat has carved
out a unique niche by effectively‘ using the
power of music and celebrity to reach this
population.”

One distinguishing aspect of Lifebeat is
that it doesn’t call for the artists to change
their music. Rappers and hip—hop artists,
for example, are still able to use the typical
tropes of the genres and talk about sex —
a topic whose casual treatment by some
popular artists could have the potential
to impede the messages of organizations
promoting HIV and AIDS awareness.

Joining the cause to advocate young peo-
ple to “play it safe, get tested, and protect
yourself” and performing your work as it
was originally written are not mutually
exclusive ideas. The group understands that
the ﬁght for HIV and AIDS prevention is too
important to demand rigid alterations of
lyrics. It’s thankful for all the help it can get.

said Denton, also known as Pepa. When ,

performing, she doesn’t have to tone down
her sultry lyrics or censor herself. She can
still talk about sex, but she wants young
people to know that it can be safe.
Several artists have been encouraging
fans to tweet using “#archesofhope.” Any
tweet sent in could potentially be pictured
on the giant screens that illuminate Times
Square to help bring attention to Lifebeat’s
latest project. _ . 1.
The unveiling of “The Arches of Hope,”

and AIDS awareness. It opened to the pub-
lic right before President Barack Obama’s

WOMEWS BASKETBALL

The Panthers led Notre Dameiagte in the first half. Sheldon Satenstein | Senior Staff Photographer

Dave Uhrmacher
Staﬂ Wrz'ter

All ittookwas 16 seconds. In that short period
of time, two steals and two baskets gave Notre
Dame a 5-0 lead early in Wednesday night’s
game at the Petersen Events Center. Although
Pitt tried to make a game of it, the ﬁrst minute
made it clear that the Fighting Irish were the

_ better women’s basketball team.

Playingwithout leading scorer Asia Logan,
who sustained a shoulder injury, Pitt was able
to shoot effectively in the ﬁrst half and entered
the break down just six points to a team it lost
to by a 76-point margin last year. Then Notre

V Dame’s offensive juggernaut took over right out

of the break, outscoring Pitt 38-18 during the

‘ ﬁnal 20 minutes.

The No. 2 Irish (17-1, 6-0 Big East) moved
another game ahead of the Big East ﬁeld with
the 73-47 victory, and Pitt’s (9-9, 0-5 Big East)
conference losing streak stretched to 23 games
in a row. 4

Up by three points after a 13-2 run, Pitt sur-
rendered a 3-point shot to Irish senior guard
Skylar Diggins that tied the game at 25 with
6:37 remaining in the ﬁrst half. The Panthers
would not regain the lead from that point on.

After a48—percent shooting performance in
the ﬁrst half, Pitt recorded only 18 points inthe
second half, a result of the team’s 23.1-percent
second-half shooting performance.

“We played defense,” Diggins said of the
difference in the second half. “We picked up
our defensive intensity, rebounded the bas-
ketball and really got out into transition in the
second hal .”

The lack of a legitimate inside presence cou-
pled with Logan’s absence allowed Notre Dame
to have a ﬁeld day around the bucket, scoring
42 of its 73 total points in the painted area.

Redshirt junior Ashlee Anderson and red-
shirt freshman Loliya Briggs both chipped in
eight points for Pitt at the four spot, but Logan’s
absence could not be compensated for on a
night the Panthers needed to play their best
game in order to have any chance at a win.

“You never know when someone is going to

«a.

go down,” said Briggs. “You just always have to '‘

be ready when the times comes. Take it as an
opportunity to go out there and keep pushing.
Just be ready to play at all times.”

There is currently no time table for Logan’s
retum.

Erie, Pa., native Kayla McBride led the Irish
in scoring with 19 points, followed by guard

Jewell Loyd’s 14-point performance and Dig-
gins’ 13.

“It was great to be able to come home and
see family in the stands,” said McBride. “It feels
like ahomecoming. I know a lot of people from
Erie came down for the game, and I am glad we
got the win.”

After qualifying for the Big East tourna-
ment in each of the last ﬁve years, the Pitt
women’s volleyball program -is ready to
take the next step by joining the Atlantic
Coast Conference next season. .
Looking to compete inone of the best
conferences in the country, Pitt hired
Dan Fisher to lead the Panthers‘. Fisher
comes to Pitt from Concordia University
in Irvine, Calif., where last year he won
a NAIA National Championship with the
Eagles in just his second season. He previ-

GABLER STYLE

Breaking unwritten coaching
rule pays off for 49ers

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff I/Vriter

If San Francisco 49ers head coach Jim Har-
baugh hadn’t broken an unwritten rule, the
second-year head coach wouldn’t be a little
more than a week away from coaching in his
ﬁrst Super Bowl.

The unwritten rule is, of course, that no
player should lose his job after incurring an
injury, but Harbaugh bucked that trend when
he replaced quarterback Alex Smith with Colin
Kaepemick.

p Smith suffered a concussion in Week 10
and was ready to return to the ﬁeld for the
49ers in Week 12. But instead of going with
the safe choice, Harbaugh put his faith in the
dual-threat Kaepemick, who had been the
backup prior to Smith’s injury.

The 49 ers have relied upon the second—year

Game in Pittsburgh, but the following season
the Steelers won the Super Bowl, with Roeth—
1isberger’s outstanding playoff performances
largely contributing to the team’s effort. Ro-
ethlisberger has since acquired another Super
Bowl victory and has attended three total.
What Harbaugh did with Kaepemick isn’t
groundbreaking, but the fact that anyone still

‘ questions the ethics behind his decision shows

the outdated thinking of many of those who
cover the NFL.
Rules are meant to be broken, especially
dumb ones. I
‘ NFL coaches are in a cutthroat business.
Former Browns coach Pat Shurmur and former
Chiefs coach Romeo Crennel are only two in
the line of coaches ﬁred after a mere two years
on the job. Without even receiving a chance
to bring in players and developthem, those

Colin Kaepemick took over as the 49ers’ starting quarterback. MCT Campus

quarterback since then, but an even more
notable second—year quarterback got his job
after his head coach broke the rule.

In 2001, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick
turned to his backup second—year quarterback
— a sixth—round selection out of Michigan
— to replace the injured Drew Bledsoe. That
quarterback turned out to be Tom Brady, and
he led the Patriots to their ﬁrst Super Bowl
title that year. Brady has since won two more
Super Bowls with the Patriots and been to the
big game a total of ﬁve times.

Another quarterback to take the starting
job after a player injury is Ben Roethlisberger.
The Steelers quarterback took over for Tommy
Maddox after he went down in the second
game of the 2004 season. Roethlisberger led
the Steelers to 131 straight wins —— he sat out
the ﬁnal game to prepare for the playoffs ——
and helped the Steelers become the AFC’s ﬁrst
15—win team.

A Roethlisberger came up short in Brady’s
ﬁrst—season Super Bowl when he lost to the
Patriots quarterback in the AFC Championship

coaches were let go.

It’s a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately
league, and Harbaugh’s NFC Championship
loss in 2012 wasn’t going to secure his job
for long.

The decision to go with Kaepemick saved
the 49ers’ season. San Francisco has a cham-
pionship—ca1iber defense, a top-notch punter,
offensive weapons in Michael Crabtree and
Frank Gore and arguably the league’s best
offensive line. The time to win a Super Bowl
is now. ‘ ‘

It’s possible that Smith could have guided
San Francisco to the title -— mediocre quar-
terbacks like Trent Dilfer with the Ravens in
2001 have won Super Bowls before — but it
would have been very unlikely. _

‘ What’s more probable is that Harbaugh
would be sitting in a luxury box in New Orleans
watching Super Bowl XLVII with his parents
while his brother, Ravens head coach John
Harbaugh, coached in his ﬁrst Super Bowl. _

You can’t follow outdated rules when your
livelihood is on the line. I

VOLLEYBALL

' The Pitt News talked with the Univer-
sity’s new volleyball coach shortly after
he was introduced to the Panthers.

TPN: What was your first impression
after meeting the team last night?

Fisher: The team seems like a nice
group of girls who were just excited to
get in the gym and get to work. From an

‘ attitude standpoint, they are right where

they need to be. They are eager to start
playing volleyball, and I am looking for-
ward to that as well.

TPN: After winning a championship
at Concordia, what was it like to leave‘?

Fisher: It was hard to say goodbye to
a successful team. We only had one girl
from the championship team graduate.
I made good friends there and became a
better coach. Hopefully I can use those

‘teaching skills to help the Pitt girls be-
. ,c_q1;_1e successful both (on and off the court.

can make the NCAA Tournament. I am
looking forward to competing with the
best teams in the country. If we can be
competitive in the ACC, that means that
we can be successfulgat the national level.

W HOOPS

Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato stressed
that in hindsight, her Panthers stayed with a
team that has played in back—to-back national
championship games.

“I think it is a great opportunity for us to play '

a top—ﬁve team in the nation',f’ said Berenato. “I
have to look at what they have done this season,
what we have done this season, andl think it is
so important to realize what we did in the ﬁrst
half against one of the best teams in the country.
What an awesome opportunity for us to have,
and I thought that if we played with heart, we
could play with them.”

Pitt was paced by sophomore guard Brianna

 

The DIETRICH School of

 Arts..& Sciences

Kiesel’s 12 points and six assists. She scored
nine of her points in the ﬁrst half but was shut
down by Diggins and backup point guard Whit-
ney Holloway in the second half.

Coach Berenato liked what she saw in the
ﬁrst half against such a talented squad, and she
hopes her improvingyoung teamwillbe able to
ﬁnally win a Big East game when the Panthers
travel to face Georgetown on Saturday at 4 p.-m.

“I am really proud of the team and how
they played in the ﬁrst half,” Berenato said.
“We had three freshmen and two sophomores
on the courffor a majority of the time, and to
put those ﬁve kids against Notre Dame, the
statistics were not that different. This team gets
better everyday. A measurement of improve-
ment, absolutely.” I
