Class or Groups?

“2—‘—Should there be representation‘

on Council based upon class or group?
The composition of the Council as at
present constituted is as follows:

— Classes. Members in Graduates
. Council. Represented.

Prior to 1890 5 W 100 (1 :20)

1890 to 1900 17 500 (1:30)

1910 to 1910 18 1200 (1:67)
1911 to 1922 22 2400 .(1:109)

“It would thus appear that the
classes prior to 1890 have proportion-
ately greater representation than later
.c1asses.- Your committee does not,
however, believe that class represen-
tation makes a great deal of difference
so far as the alumni are concerned
and believe that this matter will al-
ways take care of itself in the elec-
tion of the members, and in all re-
spects be mutually satisfactory to all
of the members of the Association.
Your committee, therefore, does not
recommend any representation. based
upon chase or group.

“3-—lS‘hould provision be made for
the representation of out of town
alumni associations? A constitution-
al amendment of -1920 authorized the
president of any recognized Pitt club
or another delegated by him, to sit
with Council at its meetings and have
full voting powers. When the pur-
pose of these Pitt Clubs is consider-
ed, and compared with the aims of
the General -Alumni _Association, it
appears to your committee that the
spirit of the amendment is to be com-.
mended, and continued. Your com-
mittee feels, however, that the phras-
ing of the amendment should be
changed in order to prevent any mis-
understanding in the future. Instead
of any other member of the Alumni
Association, the delegate should be a
bona ﬁde member of the Pitt club by
which he is appointed. The sugges-
tion is incorporated in the new section
as submitted‘ herewith.

No Change in Numbers.

“4——Shouldi there be a~c~hange in the

cil?_ Your committee recommends
that the number of members in the
present Council remain unchanged.

small committees it is the function
of the Council as a whole to keep the
alumni interested in the work of the
University. The body as at present
constituted is not unwieldly, and the
number of members makes for a lar-
ger interest in the University among
the graduates and the compiunity. ’

“5—If the membership on the basis .

of schools is continued, what schools
should be represented? This ques-
tion chiefly, concerns the Evening
School of Economics, and to some de-
gree the now non-existent School of
Chemistry. At’ the present time, these
schools are directed and‘ controlled
-by the School of Economics‘ and the
College, respectively. There are few
graduates of either in comparison with
the number of graduates from the
other schools of the University. The

and former Pittsburghcrs. Tljie above picture shows part of the group, about avdozen additional ones-coming in

after the flashlight was taken.

After the feed (everyone had something to sa

y, and it was one of the most enjoyable little affairs of its kind
' the A|umni.Seci-etary has ever attended. Dr. J. H. (“Hube”) Wagner, M.D. '14, team physician, was on hand to

lead the cheers, and he attended to his duties in a way that would have done credit to “Jlmm.y" Scott. .Repre-
sentatives of all the departments of the University were present, including several who might be classed as “old

timers."

Among the well-known ﬁgures there were ’Dr. J. V. McAlpin, Dent. ’04, who was responsible for a “Gob"

band of 60 pieces going to the game at Palo Alto to. play and root for the Panthers; Chalmers Hall, Mines 1'13.
former track and football manager and celebrated‘ writer ('2); R. H.’ (“Harv”) Jamison, Eng. '08, who used to run

the middle distances on the track team; Dr. R. H. Ludwig, Dent. '17, a former member of the swimming team and «

Glee Club;' M..W. (“Mike”) Scanlon, publicity agent of the Westinghouse interests in Frisco, who boosted the af-
fair; G. S-. Paisley, Phar. '94, with I118 wife; «Gordon H. Bell, a member of the faculty of the University of Cali-

evening School of ‘Economics is do
ing very important (work among the
members of the community who are
unable to attend the day school
classes on the campus, and the stand-
ard of scholarship is the same as that
prescribed byany of the other schools.
University credit is given for‘su‘ccess-
ful completion of the courses, and
degrees are granted upon the same
basis as any other school in the Uni-
versity. It appears to your commit‘-
tee, however, that this school can be
represented by the ‘representatives of
the School of Economics, who might,
in fact, be graduates of the Evening
School. There is-nothing..in the con-
stitution 'to -prevent the. nomination
and election of such a representative.
The same recommendation appliesto
the School of Chemistry graduates,
who can be represented through the
College. ’ A
Recommendations.

“Your committee therefore recom-
mends the following section in the
proposed new constitution to replace
Article IV, Section 1: There shall
be an Alumni‘ Council composed of
ﬁfty members of the General Alumni
Association, in good standing, chosen
from the alumni and associate alumni
of the several schools ofthe Univer-
sity. The membership ofthe Coun-
cil shall include two members from
each of the schools of the University
which are listed in the current cata-
logue ofthe University. The other
member shall be chosen at large. Past
presidents, the president, Vice Presi-
dent, secretary, treasurer and other
elected‘ officers o-f the General Alumni
Association, and the president of any
recognized Pitt Club (or a, bona ﬁde
member thereof by him delegated)
shall’ be ex-ofﬁcio members of Alumni

Council.”

Class Reunion.-
.Chairman Hay’s report-outlined in
detail the plans for ‘a system of class
reunions around Commencement, or

at some other suitable time during.

the year, when an organized effort
will be made to. get out a large per-
centage of the various reunion classes.
With the facilities at the Faculty Club
and ,the surrounding grounds, it\ is
possible now to do more in the way-
of bringing about class reunions than
ever before,.and the committee will
work with the Alumni Secretary in
bringing this about.

_ This feature will probably be de-p

veloped with the plan of “Alumni Giv-
ing" which has been under considera-
tion by Council for a number of meet-
ings,’ the details of which will be an-
nounced in the very near future. The
list of reunion classes will be ready
for publication soon, there being a
slight change recommended in the re-
port presented by Mr. Hay.

THE COLOR OF A DIFFERENT
. HORSE

 

Sociologists debate whether or not
heterogeneous America can ever be
amalgamated into a single racial en-
tity. It seems unquestionable, how-
ever, that the conditions which dif-
ferentiate American society from its
European parent have integrated an
individual American psychology the
characteristics of which have been
variously commended and attacked.

One of the most regrettable fea-
tures of America's high-powered psy-
chology of efficiency i_s the atrophy
of what little sense of humor that re-
mained as the heritage of Mid-Vic-
torian England. The average Ameri-
can, in fact most Americans even far’
above the average, have long since
ceased to distinguishbetween serious-
ness and solemnity.

The reason for this failure to dis-
tinguish probably lies in the fact that
the two have been unfortunately as-
sociated for so long a time. A sense
of humor is more or less synonymous
with a sense of proportion. 112;; lack
has caused Americans to pursue in
the
particular goals or fetiches toward
which they have directed their des-
tinies. The man of serious mind, the
one who consciously selected ideals
worthy of his pursuit, became so im-
importance of
achieving them, so iscornful of the
stunted minds that pursued inferior-
ities, that he drew about himself a
cloak of solemnity from ‘which he has
never become free. ‘

The chief victim of this condition

whose evaluations of aims and ideals
is reasonably keen, but who posseses
sufficient sense of proportion to real-
ize his own fallability in the process

and sufficient sense ‘of. humor to pre-

“ MORTAR BOARD

  

, ]Alpha’ Lambda Nu is to be congratulated upon bringing Mortar
Board, the national Senior women ’s honorary activities fraternity to
iiei Pitt campus.‘ The signiﬁcance of such recognition is that the
niversity has attracted nation-wide attention in its promulgation of
 activities. V E ‘ ‘ V
J  §E'itt’-s constantly increasing enrollment of women has served to
imulate the number and quality of organizations open to women.
"7.-oconsistent endeavor on the part of the co-eds, our University suc-
eded in being recognizeid by many national organizations, of which
Vie  S. G. A., the Y. W. C. A. and W. A. A. are a fewexamples.
’1'~'he‘extent of the work of these groups has grown rapidly. Never-
heless, it has -requiredyears of conscientious eifort on the part of
A eco-eds to reach the present state of efficiency in leading activities.
1 ;, Since their organization in 1916, Alpha Lambda Nuhas spon-
ed igall _women’s activities represented here. This group was or—
nized, expressly to encourage undergraduate women in active par-
ticipation in school activities and to honor Senior girls who had
rpved themselves ‘leaders in s/tudentlaﬂairs and students of worthy
liolarship. V I V ‘
-The present chapter of seven Senior girls has followed out the
riinal program”“’of the founders to the ,fullest extent. It has re-
v-ed theiGirls’ Glee Club, chaperoned the noon-day dances, aided
ii campus drives and in numerous other ways" has made co-educa—_
tonal; opportunities abound. For the transition from Pitt of eight
Tears ago to the Pitt of today, these wide-awake girls are largely
esponsible. , “ _
' «Installation of a Mortar Board chapter will enable Pitt women
orlyears‘ to come to develop all resources present in the institution
toiplant new ﬁelds for growth. In this undertaking, our Uni-
hrsity will be linked with some twenty of the best institutions in the

Well folks I haven't much to say as
‘we are in the midst of examinations
and I have to study harder than _
usual. Yesterday I went to a church

supper which was ﬁfty cents for kids
and seventy cents for me but I dont
see why I had to pay more than
some of the kids I saw there for
they ate a lot more than I could. I
meta swell looking girl there who
went to the movies with me after-
wards and she is going to give me
a date as soon as exams are over.
There were exemptions in some of
my subjects and when i asked one
of my prolfessors if I was exempt he
says no but that he was just letting
me take the examination because
maybe I would be lucky and pass
after all blllt I think he was just
kidding. , . -
Well I’ll write more next time

Youth should be able to really ap-

a new year-——youth in the ‘person of
a college student. What a glorious
combination is youth and a smiling
tomorrow. In the radiant promise of
a new year youth can forget the in-
effectual yesterdays and the might '
have beens. A new year—-three hun-
dred and sixty-ﬁve sun rises on a
world of vivid colors, great deeds, no-
ble desires. To see 'a color, to do a
deed, to feel a desire each day——that
is living. As the tired, pathetically
triumphant year dies and youth is
born again in the world, a burden ,de-
parts from the weary, the ability to

TEST RESULTS
ABE ANNOUNCED

Miss Margaret McC1enahan
Assisted by Miss Manola
Vero Conducts Tests Here

 

Miss Margaret McClenahan, assist-
ed by Miss Vero of the Physical Ed-
ucation Departmept, has completed a
series of motor ability tests, which all
women students enrolled in gymna-
sium classes have*- undergone. These
tests, which are a part of the general
physical efficiency" tests in which prac-
tically all large women-’s colleges are
competing, are planned ‘to measure
muscle and endurance by motor abil-
ty, which consists in running high
jump, basket ball throw, 25-yard dash,
buck, boom, ropes, tumbling and gym-
nastics.
~ A.ll the tests ’were taken without
previous practice. Of the number
completing the tests up to January 15,

The highest possible score in the
tests is 80 points, there being eight
events, each with a possible score of
10 points. The highest Pitt score,
made b_y Miss -Jeanne Meuter, was 57
points. '

The highest average score for Pitt
students was in the 25-yard dash, the
average being eight points. The num-
ber of seconds given in order to score
10 points was 4.1 seconds, while over
two-thirds Of the Pitt girls competing
finished in less than four seconds. It
is‘ doubtful‘-' if this record. could be
beaten by any of the girls’ colleges
undergoing the tests.

The lowest average score for Pitt
students was made in rope-climbing
and tumbling. Two girls reached the
top of the ropes and two completed
the tumbling requirements. It must
be remembered, however, that the
Pittsburgh high schools, from which
the majority of the entrants come,
give no training in these two
branches of physical education.

While the Freshmen and Sopho-
mores predominate in the number en-
tered and in the number included in
the highest ten scores in all classes,
the Juniors and Seniors stood’ fairly
well, considering that entrants from
the latter two classes were as a rule
only girls doing make-up work.

The results were as follows: .
