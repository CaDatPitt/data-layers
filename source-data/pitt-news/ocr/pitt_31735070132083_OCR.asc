One of America’s greatest student newspapers — since 1906

A VOLUME XCVIII, NUMBER 108

Kweli covers politics, rap

\_

JESSICA KNAB
Staff Writer

Emcee Talib Kweli, whose name
means “the seeker of truth and knowledge”,
in Arabic and Ghanaian, respectively, wants
students to “grow up and recapture” people
like Martin Luther King Jr. did.

5 Kweli spoke to a crowd that exceeded
the capacity of the Assembly Room in the
William Pitt Union on Monday night.

The speech, attended by_high school
students, college students and graduates,
criticized the nation’s celebration of Black
History Month, political processes, and the
black community’s involvement with ﬂie
Democratic Party. 1 -

The event, presented by Black Actio
Society, was held in celebration of Black
History Month. ’ L

Kweli said that Black History Month is
meant to “bring light to the accomplish-
ments of the black people in this country.”

He also expressed his concern that the
nation only recognizes the “African contri-
bution to American history” as being
“something that can be contained within a

_ mon .”

‘-‘Black History Month, as much as I
appreciate it, has becomesort of annoying
to me,” Kweli said. “I think it should be a

than ‘ just a

and negative aspects
of the Civil Rights
Movement and their
reﬂection on the _~

$42.5 million
will improve
Pitt buildings

LORA WOODWARD
Staff Writer

Construction workers may seem to take '

over the University in the next few months,
as Pitt has scheduled $42.5 million in reno-
vations and upgrades to four buildings.

A 50,000 square—foot expansion of
Clapp/Langley/Crawford (CLC) halls,
scheduled to start in mid-April, will 
ily provide additional biological research
laboratory space, said John Walluk, senior
administrator for Facilities Management.

The CLC project will cost $25.5 mil-
lion and includes inﬁastructure work. The
undertaking should not interfere greatly with
classes because it will mainly be done out-
doors, and the b11lk of construction will be
ﬁnished during the summer, Walluk said

“Pitt is trying to make things better,” he
‘explained. 1 ‘
‘ One major ventilation unit will replace
the 145 fans on top of Chevron Science
Center. The $6 million project__should begin
in March and will take a year to complete,
according to Walluk

Replacement of Trees Hall’s roof will

begin after classes let out in the spring, ’

Walluk added. The $5.1 million project also
includes general renovations to the building.

The ﬁrst major renovation plans for the
year began in early January on the second
and third ﬂoors of the Cathedral of

Muslims important in
America, speaker says

LAURA J ERPI
Staff Writer

When Christopher Columbus dis-

covered America, he was carrying a’

copy of the 13th century Arab scholar
Al-Idrissi’s work, according to Arnir
Muhammed.

Al-Idrissi’s studies contained infor-
mation that eight Muslim explorers had
previously discovered a new continent.

During Colurnbus’s ﬁrst voyage,
two Muslim captains accompanied
him.

The Islamic Center of Pittsburgh

I hosted the event, “Muslims in America:

Seven Centuries of History” on
Monday evening, where Muhammad,
of the “Collections and Stories of
American Muslims” group, held a lec-
ture on the history of Muslims in
America

Displays containing photographs
and stories created a gallery, which
praised some of the many Muslims who
worked to make America the successful
and powerful country that it is today.

Muhammad explained several dif-
ferent collections of stories about
notable American Muslims.

According to Muhammad, the
names of a few American cities have
special meanings to Muslims.

- “There are stories that Tallahassee
[Fla] is supposed to mean ‘returning to
 he said.

“Islamic history in America is a
ﬁeld wide open,” Muhammad added.

Between 1566 and 1587, many
Muslims settled into the areas we now
know as North Carolina, Tennessee,
Kentucky and Vrrginia, he explained
They were the ﬁrst people to extensive-
ly inhabit this area, with the exception
of American Indians, Muhammad
added.

American Muslims have played an
important role in the United State’s
early history, serving as the founders of
several permanent colonies and ﬁghting
in both the War of 1812 and the Civil
War, according to Muhammad

Between the large number of
immigrants from the Islamic world and
new American converts, Islam is the
fastest growing religion in both
America and the entire world. Eight
million Muslim Americans, including
the famous boxer Muhammad Ali, live
in the United States.

become a “popularity contest.”

“Ever since the Democratic Party has had
candidates who have aligned themselves with
the needs of African-Americans, we’ve given
our votes onia platter to the Democrats, and
tl1at’s kind of crazy,” Kweli said. “You’ve got
something that’s beautiful, that’s a tool, like a
vote, but can become destructive because you
participate in a process that’s blind.”

Kweli also I spoke out against the
Democratic Party’s lack of ambition concem-

‘ing the last presidential election,

“It’s a shame that somebody like George
Bush, who’s obviously stupid —— obviously —
had to come into power before the Democrats
could step up,’f Kweli said.

Kweli called the political process unfair
and unbalanced.

“I can’t say any of the candidates, like John
Kerry, or Howard Dean, or any of these people
who sound good and look good on television, I
can’t. really say I relate to [them],” Kweli said.
“And anybody who relates to me will never
have a chance of winning, the way the system
is set up.”

Kweli asked students to recognize their
resources and to ﬁnd and empower a candidate
_who relates to, and acts responsibly toward, the
black community. ’

Kweli also emphasized the importance of
uniﬁcation within the black community.

“I think that our revolution needs to hap-

pen on every level,” Kweli said. “We need our
revolutionary creatures, teachers, people who
vote, people who don’t vote, drug dealers, cops,
whatever. We need to be one type of thought.”

The Emcee applauded the students for
reaching out and making an effort, whﬂe warn-
ing them of losing their direction.

Kweli used the example of Rosa Parks,
who drew attention in the 1955 when she
wouldn’t give up her seat to a white person on
the bus, and her current conﬂicts with the hip-
hop group Outkast. , ‘

“You have Rosa Parks, or whoever is
advising Rosa Parks, trying to sue Outkast over
a song having her name as the title of the song
-— that sounds crazy,” Kweli said. “Outkast has
successfully allowed the music to grow and
revolutionized what hip-hop music can and
will be. They have the power. They have power
to us. To me, that’s divide and conquer.”

‘Though Kweli spoke of the power of hip-
hop and the empowerment of the black com-
munity through hip-hop, he said he did not feel
artists should always be held responsible for
beliefs expressed in their work.

“I think [that] right now, there is no context
for artists to be ‘ political,” Kweli said. “Too
often, artists are put into positions where
they’re treated like leaders because they have
the attention on them and all the hype sur-
rounding them. Do I think that’s not fair for
artists? Yeah, it’s not fair. But it’s not any less
fair than any of you people having to play a role
model to anybody in your life.”

THE PITT NEWS

Writer Stephanopoulos among
PUR contributors of the past

PUR, page 1

the academic papers of college undergradu-
ates with as wide a subject range as does the
PUR.

The evolution of the PUR began in the
early 1980s when Pitt student Robert Pape
returned from studying in Europe and had a
conversation with current Dean of Pitt’s
Honors College Alec Stewart _

“We were sitting around a room up
here, before it was renovated,” recalled
Stewart, “and he said, ‘You know, ﬂrere is a
lot of really good stuff that students write that
disappears into the circular ﬁle. We "should
create a journal that publishes ﬁrst—class
undergraduate scholarship.”,’

Stewart  and with the support of
the honors program, Pape assembled a staif,
compiled undergraduate submissions and
gathered funding to release what would be
the ﬁrst issue of the PUR in the spring of
1981. It would go on to publish the papers of
many talented undergraduate writers in the

following years, including a few who would
later gain widespread notoriety beyond their
academic exploits.

Stephanopoulos, for example, pub-
lished his paper, “Credibility versus Fear“.
The Politics of Missile Modernization in
West Germany,” in the PUR while studying
at Colombia University in 1982.

Following its inception, the publication
caught the attention of the National
Collegiate Honors Council, an organization
of honors programs in state—re1ated universi-
ties, and its then-president John Portz. Portz,
who was also head of the honors program at.
the University of Maryland, helped the PUR
gain wider attention, Stewart said

“He said, ‘It would be great if students
from honors programs around the country
could submit to the PUR,’” Stewart said,
“and we thought that was a good idea, too,
and we got a lot of visibility through .the
organ of the N CHC and their newsletter.”

Faculty happy to actas “referees” for PUR, says Dean Stewart

PUR, page 3

Portz suggested that the PUR request
funding from the NCHC, which they did. He
also endowed the publication with money
for the Edythe P0112 Prize, a $250 honorari-
um narned for his wife and awarded to the
writer of what is judged to be the most out-
standing work in each issue.

According to current PUR Editor in
Chief Hali Felt, it costs around $3,000 dol-
lars in Honors College-supplied funds to put
out each issue. Issues are usually released
twice a year.

She added that the publication currently
sports a staif of about 10, including staff
members who maintain the journal’s Web

Stewart said. “It’s not unusual to get the

Stewart considers the extra effort by
those who submit papers to the PUR as inter-

twined with the goals of the publication 

‘itself.

“A willingness to do what’s required to
get a paper into publishable form means that
you have a special passion for the life of the
mind, and there has to be an outlet for schol-
arly initiative for undergraduate students
who aren’t yet faculty members who earn
their living for it,” Stewart said.

According to Felt, those looking to pick

Al-Qaida memo details war attempts

Single terrorist organization seeks
Willing insurgents for short-term war-
startingrelationship.

A 17-page memo confiscated from
an Al-Qaida suspect reveals two things

. about the current state of Iraq, and the

United States’ occupation there.

First, Al-Qaida is, in fact, working
in Iraq, attempting to start a sectarian
war between the Shiite and Sunni
Muslims there, though the organiza-
tion has not been connected to Saddam
Hussein’s regime in any way.

And, second, it’s having trouble
recruiting.

The Christian Science Monitor,

building on reports done by The
Sydney Morning Herald, The New
York Times and the Associated Press,
reported that the memo taken from

Abu Musab Zarqawi and translated by-

the U.S. military called for a_ war, but,
as the Associated Press reports, “the
resistance against the U.S. occupation
was struggling to recruit Iraqis andito
combat American troops.”

Obviously, this is good news for
both the Iraqi people and the U.S. per-
sonnel stationed there. It speaks to the
fact that Al-Qaida and Hussein loyal-
ists have not been linked conclusively,
and that Al-Qaida is thankfully suffer-
ing because of that.

Al-Qaida and Hussein had differ-
ent agendas — both terrible and
destructive, with the United States as a

common enemy, to be -sure — but vast-
ly different.

‘ And now that Hussein has been

deposed, the Iraqi people shouldn’t be
swayed by an organization that wants
to start massive internal strife before
June 30, when the United States is
supposed to give the Iraqis sovereign-
ty.

Al-Qaida is attempting to play on
animosities between Sunni and Shiite
Muslims; the Shiites are the majority
in Iraq, and, according to The Times,
the memo suggests attacks on Shiite
sites in order to incite Sunni opposi-
tion.

The Times also reports that
Zarqawi is presumed to have had a
role in several recent attacks, includ-
ing three car bombings within the past
six months. 8'

Though this‘ news cannot repair
the damage done, not bring back the
lives lost, it does indicate that some of
the resistance. within Iraq comes not
from the Iraqi people, but an outside
organization. That organization is one
"that is losing its ground there, and one
with which people are not willing to
cooperate. '
Whatever identity Iraqi people devel-
op, it will not include Al-Qaida and
large—scale sectarian war. And hope-
fully, Zarqawi and people like him will
not gain footholds in_an already trou-
bled country.

Sexy “Pizzagra” to whet British appetites

Ours is a strange society. We have cer-

and the wild popularity of Viagra

There’s also an obsession
with unhealthy foods, as illus-
trated by our expanding

though, I guess I’m not too shocked at the

into an inevitable failure. After all, these are
the people who lost the biggest
empire in history, in addition to
inﬂicting such atrocities as the
Spice Girls upon an unsuspect-

A U.K. supermarket chain bearing the

sexual stimulants in pill form. We also love
corporate mergers, so don’t be surprised to
see Pﬁzer Pharmaceuticals, the makers of
Viagra, merging with Pizza Hut or
Domino’s in the near ﬁlture to create a true
Pizzagra. The shwr genius and universal
appeal of such a product is self—evident; I’m
surprised no one thought of it earlier. It
would undoubtedly become the most popu-

So, next time you’re eating fattening, artery-

Just like his daddy: Bush maywin the war and lose election

George H. W. Bush won the first Gulf War and
enjoyed the highest approval ratings of any president
before losing the 1992 election. George W. Bush ‘has
won the second Gulf War, enjoyed some of the high-
est approval ratings of any president and may be des-
tined to the same fate as his father.

The elder Bush lost his bid for re-election due to
economic issues, namely, a “jobless econ-
omy.” Now Dubya, already facing \doubts
about both the economy’s current state
and prospects —— and certain to become
the first president since Herbert Hoover to
have created a net loss in jobs during his .
term, with the 2.2 million person increase
in unemployment since his taking over —
now faces increasing problems in his war 
in Iraq. '

In a recent National Public Radio
interview, and later in a report to the U.S.
Senate, former Chief Iraq Aims Inspector
David Kay revealed that he did not ﬁnd,

nor did he believe Iraq possessed, weapons of mass 0
destruction or stockpiles of chemical and biological ’

weapons. “I don’t think they exist,” he said. “It turns
out that we were all wrong, and that is most disturb-
1ng.”‘ 0 A .

This comes on the heels of accusations by former
Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill —— known for, his
candor — that Bush intended to depose Saddam
Hussein long before Sept. 11, 2001. Still, the Bush

administration continues to defend its war as just, »
i even as the reasons they gave. ———_ of Hussein’s ties to

Al-Qaida and the existence of WMDS —have been

reduced to myths. . ‘ -
Though Kay refused to put any responsibility

upon the administration and blamed intelligence

reports instead,‘ Bush and his neo-conservatives
pushed for this war when the threat simply did not
warrant such action. - I
Bush went to war believing he would be proven
correct in regards to the existence of WMDS. This
view, however, was not created as a result of strong
intelligence pointing in that direction; it had been for-
mulated long before, along with the deci-
sion to go to war. Intelligence data that
provided the administration with suitable
explanations of “suspicious” movements
were highlighted, suggestions that pro-
posed alternative — and ultimately, cor-
I rect — explanations for such activity were
dismissed.
Bush reasoned that Hussein would
not have misled U.N. inspectors if he did
not have anything to hide. Now that it has
been revealed‘ that Hussein was lied to by
‘his. own scientists about their military
capabilities out of their fear of displeasing

the tyrant, the alternative explanation presents itself,

accounting for both Hussein’s reluctance to accom-
modate inspectors and the absence of WMDS.

The war that we entered because of Bush’s dan-
gerous assumption has produced strained diplomatic

. ties with allies and has succeeding only in furthering
, the View of America as an imperial evil, especially in

regions of the world in which credibility was not our
strength to begin with.
It is" fmally undeniably clear that Hans Blix, the

.U.N. and, yes, France were right — and we wrong —

in judging the Iraqi threat. Maybe wars should not be
led on assumptions and uncertain intelligence after all.

Still, withstanding the intelligence failure, Bush
had an option that would have justified the war polit-

ically. He could have taken the diplomatic route which
Europe and most of the world advocated, passing one
ﬁnal U.N. resolution and giving Iraq an explicit ulti-
matum: follow the terms dictated, or face war. As it
stands, he has managed to unnecessarily undermine
America’s standing abroad, the war effort and the
cohesiveness of the international community all at
once, which is no small feat. '

As for other justiﬁcations given for the war, sure,
the world is a safer place without Hussein, and the
Iraqi people are “liberated.” But so long as we are
being honest, let us be honest about our intentions.

We have rarely gone to war to make the world a

safer place or a people more free unless our own inter- I

ests were directly involved. In fact, we have support-
ed exponentially more dictators, who have endan-
gered the world at the expense of brutalizing those
under their rule, than we have run military campaigns
for humanitarian ends. This trend was certainly not
abandoned for the people of Iraq — their liberation
was merely a side effect of pursuing national interests
and was never a sincere objective of the people who
embarked on this war. ‘ E“

The elder Bush lost to a man whose sexual indis-

cretions cost his party the presidency.-, If a political ,
party can lose the White House over an extramarital ’

blowj ob, it can certainly do the same by, waging a pre-
mature — and now undeniably illegitimate —— war.
After all, the political cost of 528 American lives, and
between 8,000 and 10,000 Iraqi civilian lives, thrown
away by the Bush administration in an unnecessary
war should, at the very least, be equal to the political
cost of a receiving a blowjob. -

Media underreporting Palestinian deaths from Israeli actions

Thursday, Jan. 29, a Palestinian
detonates a shrapnel-packed ‘explosive
on a crowded Jerusalem bus.‘ He kills
10, plus himself. He wounds 50 more.

Even more tragic than this repre-
hensible act is the fact that, as wrong
as it is, it is dwarfed by Israeli crimes.

As the BBC reported — apparent-
ly, foreign media outlets try to give
context — at least 2,600 Palestinians
and 875 Israelis have been killed since
the beginning ’ of the second
Palestinian Intifada — Arabic for
“uprising” — in September 2000. For
the math-impaired, this means that
Palestinian deaths — at least 439 of
which were victims younger than 18,
according to Israeli human rights
organization B’Tselem — outnumber
Israeli deaths three to one. _

If this sounds new, thank the
press.

According to a recent study of
Middle East coverage in the San Jose
Mercury News — a representative
part of that intractable U.S. liberal

r media — “the killing of an Israeli was

over 19 times more likely to show up
in a front-page headline than the
killing of a Palestinian.” Nor was the

paper likely to mention who’s footing

the bill — only 1.1 percent of articles
mentioned U.S. aid to Israel. Similar
figures exist for the San Francisco
Chronicle.

This may explain why. only 12
percent of respondents in an August
2002 poll correctly identified Israel as
“mainly to blame for the
violence.” I

Those of us- concerned
with reality may also be
interested in a larger View
of human rights in the
Occupied Territories.

With all the subtlety of
a G Unit album, Israel is I
building a “security fence,”

 

social consequences on the daily lives
of hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians, separating families and
communities from each other and

from their land and water — their
most crucial assets,” and leaving,

Palestinians “trapped into enclaves
and cantons, unable to
have any semblance of a
normal life.” r

The list of abuses goes
on, from Israeli restric-
tions on Palestinian move-

the Palestinian economy”
(over two-thirds of Gaza
Strip residents now live in

which, as even the hawkish poverty), to the “war
New York Times columnist KEV?‘  crime” of the destruction
Thomas Friedman says, “is 0 "mm of more than 4,000

apparently part of a broad-

er [Israeli Prime Minister

Ariel] Sharon plan to unilaterally cre-
ate an interim Palestinian ‘state in
about 50 percent of the West Bank and
all of Gaza, and leave Israel with the
rest.“

This apartheid wall’s role as a bla-
tant land grab notwithstanding,
Amnesty International notes that it is
“having devastating economic and

Palestinian homes in the
last three years.

Lest we operate under the delu-
sion that this constitutes yet another
instance of a faraway people who suf-
fer through no fault of our own, a
glance at the downrightinsulting
U.S.-brokered “peace process” is in
order. ~

The United States, furnishing
Israel with around $3 billion each year

ment that have “crippled

in military aid, has single-handedly
rejected dozens of .U.N. Security
Council resolutions on the conﬂict
that are accepted virtually unanimous-
ly throughout the world.

’ Instead, the United States has sup-
ported plans that, as Amnesty notes,

a have failed to “address the key human

rights issues.” Such plans, adds Jeff
Halper — who is, as the Guardian
notes, “regularly called in by the U.S.
Embassy to brief visiting American
officials” -— are part of a greater strat-
egy for “a two-state solution based on
a bantustan, along the lines of those
South Africa tried to create during the
apartheid era. They will call it a coun-
try, but it won’t be a country. It will be
a ghetto.” — a ghetto made possible
by our tax money, voting habits and
silence.

The fate — and the blood —- of
the Palestinian people lies in our
hands. '

To preempt accusations of anti-
Semitism, Kevin would like to say that
only people with strong fascist ten-
dencies equate the criticism of a gov- V
ernment with the criticism of a reli-

In most of the pieces, you see your eyes, cheek or
the side of your mouth reﬂected back to you in thin
shards of mirror that are arranged around globular

designs of paint. You are forced to confront your own '

reaction to”Kelly’s art and see yourself in the context
of the surface patterns and tensions she has created.

Unfortunately, that reaction will probably fall
somewhere between apathy and mild amusement
being able to fix your hair in the surface of a paint-

The abstract works have interesting texture and
an almost annoying attention to balance, but little
more. There’s a general lack of variation — most of
the works conveyed only simple surface designs.
Only a few of Kelly’s pieces elicit the feelings of vio-

Most of the pieces are small, 8-by—8-inch squares

“Zieleny” is representative of the group because it is
primed with one solid, matte color that is overlaid
with thick splotches of paint in four shades that have

The paint pools on the dag-

points up toward the other

paint suggest a surprising
amount of violence.

lmprov hosts a weekend

of comedy froma survivor

Robert Schimmel is well aware
that the best comedy usually comes
from a person’s own life;

y The Bronx native will be at the
Improv this weekend, spouting off
his keen and hilarious view of rela-
tionships and sex. But he will also
take one of the most serious illness-
es a person can have — cancer —
and offer a humorous take on it.

In 2000, Schimmel was diag-
nosed with lymphoma cancer and
told that he had only six months to
live. Now, after being in remission
for three years, he has made cancer
an integral part of his comedy rou-
tine. His goal is to offer hope to
people currently undergoing treat-
ment by giving them the best medi-
cine of all — laughter. r

Schimmel has been performing
his comedic routine since 1986,
when he appeared on Rodney
Dangerfield’s “Young Comedians

Special” on HBO. After that, he‘

worked as a staff writer for “In
Living Color” until he polished his
act and went on the road again. He
has appeared on numerous televi-

sion shows, including “The
Simpsons,” “Hollywood Squares”
and “Late Night with Conan
O’Brien.” Schimmel has also
brought his talent to films such as
“Scary Movie 2” and “A Low Down
Dirty Shame.”

He has dedicated himself to eas-
ing the pain of cancer patients in
ways other than comedy, however.
He starteda national campaign to
build CD and audio book libraries in
infusion therapy centers across the
country, with great success. He also
has collected many CDs and bought
personal CD players for patients to
use during chemotherapy treat-
ments.

If you’re in the mood for_a light
take on a serious subject, you’l1 cer-
tainly want to head to the Improv‘at
the Waterfront this weekend.

Robert Schimmel will be performing
at the Improv at the Homestead
Waterfront from Feb. 12-15. For

This is one good story that doesn’t getlost in the translation

In the Miso Soup
Ryu Murakami

Kodansha International Inc.
2004
iksfrik

Translated books aren’t usually
the easiest to read. Just look at all
the problems that can occur when
translating a book from any lan-
guage into English: Necessary
words can get lost in the transla-
tion; when an English word — such
as “Mom” — is translated from the
French version of it -—— “Maman” —
the words sometimes don’t have the
same meaning. And there’s more.
But let’s move on. “

The point is that a lot of things
can happen to make what people
most fluent in a language other than
English think is a great book into
what people most familiar with the
English language think is just. a
good book.

But finally, a book has been
translated without losing its point in
the process. “In the Miso Soup” is a

storytof a young Japanese man‘

named Kenji who takes tourists
around Kubuki—cho (commonly
known as Kabukicho), the “plea—
sure” district of Tokyo, where cheap

but legal hookers and st

make their home.
Kenji is a former
college student

. who dropped out

because he had no
desire to continue
his education, so
now he shows
tourists where to
get the best sexual
gratification
around the area.
Enter Frank.

Frank is an
American who
claims to be some
sort of Toyota
‘e’n'trepr‘ene‘ur for
Americans who

came to Japan on
business. He has
read tourist guides
that claim to be
“on the inside,” but
Kenji knows the
real deal. Kenji
also acts as transla-
tor for Frank when
dealing with hook-
ers. \
Frank is, of
course, the stereo-
typical American

rippers

tourist. But Frank likes to visit hookers instead of tourist sites.

~ As the story moves on, we
learn more about who Kenji is
— the practical guy who’s just
trying to earn a living —- and
who Frank is. Eventually,
Kenji becomes wary of Frank,
thinking that Frank may be a
serial killer who sexually
assaulted and murdered .a
Japanese schoolgirl.

vlant about it and who
wouldn’t? — but he finds that
Frank is lying‘ about several
‘things that he doesn’t need to
lie about; for instance, where
and how he grew up, where
he’s actually from and why
there was a stain on his 10,000
yen bill that looked a lot like
blood. _

Anyway, the story is inter-
esting.

As for the book itself, it’s a
good read. It’s not too hard,
but it’s not too easy, and it was
actually translated by the
author, so the meanings come
across — not like those awful
translations that are boring and

page. _

After falling behind by three—tenths of a
point with only one event to go, the Pitt gym-
nastics team used a school—record-tying 49.4 on
the ﬂoor exerciseto propel them past Rutgers,

’ Cornell and Brown on Saturday night at the

Fitzgerald Field House. .

By meet’s end, the Panthers (7-2-1 overall,
3-1-1 Eastern Atlantic Gymnastics League) had
come away with a total of 194.75 points, which
is the eighth—highest total in school history.

After posting a school-record 9.875 on the
vault last week at New_ Hampshire, senior
Allyse Zeffiro set another school record this
week with a 9.95 on the floor exercise. Zeffiro

now has now made nine scores of 9.9 or higher, .

in her collegiate career. .
Senior co-captain Erika Goldberg gave her
team a lift by posting her first career 9.9 on the

~ ﬂoor exercise. ‘~

Sophomore April Pearson also had a career-
night on the ﬂoor exercise, posting a 9.875.
Pearson also recorded a team—high 9.8 on the

sophomore Roslyn Singleton, the Panthers.

were able to rebound from last week’s season-
low point total on the balance beam and record-
ed a score of 48.125.

Flo exercise helps Pitt pull out three victories

According to Zeffiro, emotions played a»

part in the Panthers’ success on Saturday.

“We had high spirits throughout the entire
meet,” Zeffiro said. “It really just kept us
going.”

Head coach Debbie Yohman remains confi-

dent that her team is one of the most talented 9

the University has. seen. She says that the high
scores should not come as a surprise, and that
with the talent these gymnasts have, this type of

V performance is to be expected.

“All of our scores should be top 10 scores,”

Yohman said. “This is one of the best teams “

we’ve had here at Pittsburgh.” . A
Yohman said she wants to focus on elimi-

nating some of the mistakes that have been

occurring in the vault and bars competitions.
“We’ve just been working really hard,”

' Yohman said. “We’ve got to get rid of the falls

on bars and we’ve g)t to work on staying on the
balance beam.” 5 ‘ ‘

Zeffiro said that she feels the team mostly
needs to work on staying sharp mentally, and
that most mistakes are because of a lack of
focus. _ ' » -

“Keeping our focus is what’s most impor-
tant,” Zeffiro said. ‘—‘I think we can get lost
sometimes, but we just need to work on staying
focused.” -

This win, the seventh of the season, ties last
year’s season total with 18 opponents still
remaining on the regular season schedule. The
Panthers next meet will take place at Kent State
this Friday, Feb. 13 at 7 pm. -

Given the numerous black eyes
the NBA has received over the past
few years from such stars and teams
as Kobe_ Bryant, Jerry Stackhouse,
Allen Iverson and the Portland
Trailblazers, rational thinking would
say that the NBA would be eager to
promote the clean and unblemished
images of its two youngest and
brightest stars.

But then again, that’s rational
thinking, and this is the NBA.

Instead of naming_ Cleveland
Cavalier LeBron James and Denver
Nugget Carmelo Anthony to the All-
Star reserve rosters,‘ the NBA chose
to exclude them and include several
players of arguably less‘ talent, and
with less enthusiasm for the game. ,

Yes, that’s right. The 2004 NBA
All-Star game this weekend in Los
Angeles will not feature the two
front—runners for Rookie of the Year
honors or the players responsible for
the current most popular selling jer-
seys according to ESPN.com.

Instead, such players as Ron
Artest, Jamaal Magloire, Andrei
Kirilenko ‘and Brad Miller will play
in the All-Star Game. While I have
nothing against these players and
don’t want to take anything away
from their great seasons, James and
Anthony have -outperformed all of
these players on every level and
deserve their spots in the All-Star
Game. ‘

Consider the Eastern trio of
James, Artest and Magloire. James’

' 20.9 points per game are more than

Artest’s' 17.9 and Magloire’s 12.
Also, in the Western trio of Anthony,
Kirilenko and Miller, Anthony’s
19.1 points _per game tops
Kirilenko’s 16.1 and Miller’s 14.7. ‘

Last year, without James and
Anthony, the Cavaliers and Nuggets
both registered final records of 17-
65. This year, with these two young
superstars, the both teams have

THE PITT NEWS

Rookies should be All-Stars

already improved — the Cavs have a
19-32 record, the Nuggets have
nearly doubled their win total from
last year with a record of 29-22.
Right now, the Nuggets are in the
eighth and final playoff spot in the
ultra—competitive I Western
Conference. Even Cleveland,
despite its current losing record,
stands only three and a half games
out of the playoffs.

Additionally, James and
Anthony "bring an excitement to the
game that the NBA has not seen
since the early,l990’s at the end of
Larry Bird’s and Magic Johnson’s
playing careers. '

Theaddition of James to the
Cavaliers has led to a 58 percent
increase in home attendance, the

largest one-year increase for any

team not playing in a new arena
since Jordan’s‘ rookie season with
the Chicago “Bulls nearly two
decades ago. Since Anthony’s
arrival in Denver, the Nuggets have
tripled their local television ratings
and generated more than $4 million

. more than they had at the same time »

last year in gate and local sponsor-

ship revenue.

Given these facts, it’s amazing
that the NBA could notplace James
and Anthony on-All-Star rosters.
What’s the NBA’s excuse? Could it
be that the NBA is trying to prove
something? For instance, that it can
survive the next two decades with-
out these .two remarkable talents,
which it cannot. Or maybe it was a
gesture by the NBA’s players and
coaches, who might consider these
two players to have too much ,power
too early in their careers. _ '

Whatever the case, I won’t be
watching‘ the All-Star game on
Sunday evening. Instead, I’ll be
watching the Rookie Challenge
game on Friday night, where the real
All-Stars will be in action.

David Shearouse thinks that the
exclusion of LeBron James and
Carmelo Anthony from the All-Star
game parallels Major League
Baseball’s decision last season to
exclude Ivan Rodriguez and Sammy
Sosa from its All-Star contest. Agree
or disagree with him at

- year head coach.

Last minute decisions hurt Pitt’s chances atperfection

It’s hard to fault a rookie
head coach who has exceeded
all expectations up to this
point, but Jamie Dixon hasn’t
exactly looked like a first-

MAR    

Who would have thought
that, with six regular season
games left, Pitt would have ‘
only two losses and lead the
nation in wins?

What’s even more amazing is how close the
Panthers came to remaining undefeated. A few
more bounces that go its way, and Pitt could have
pulled out a win at Connecticut last month. A few
less turnovers, and the Panthers wouldn’t have
had to worry about overtime against Seton Hall
on Monday.

Or had Pitt’s last-second shots fallen against
both teams, Siunday’s matchup against the
Huskies would notonly have been a chance to
extend the longest home winning streak in the
nation, but also the longest winning streak over-
all. ‘

Dixon has done an excellent job-guiding this
team back into the top 10 and has a great chance
to go deep into the NCAA Tournament.

But the one move that has made little sense
— and possibly cost the Panthers two tough road
wins -—— has been Dixon’s use of freshman
Antonio Graves late in ball games. -

Not that the blame for these losses is all on
Graves. He’s a freshman playing in the biggest

games of his life, and for him
to miss those shots isn’t
unexpected.

1 But why put him in the
position to take those shots?

One of the ‘things Dixon
has spoken at lengths about
this season is his senior lead-

ership and how the team’s
experienced players need to
. show the large number of
freshmen how to handle the spotlight. So why not
do it? ‘

Against UConn, Dixon put the ball in his
point guard’s hands, but Carl Krauser w_as
tripled-teamed as soon as he crossed halfcourt.
Krauser had no choice but to pass the ball, which
he dished off to Graves.

But why put Graves in that situation?

Not to take anything away from the fresh-
man’s shooting ability, but why not give the ball
to Julius Page or Jaron Brown? Neither one is
automatic from behind the three-point line, but
they’re seniors who have come up big in clutch
situations before.

The same goes for Monday’s game against
the Pirates.

After Krauser fouled out, why not let Page or
Brown bring the ball down and take that final
shot? They both disappeared Monday night, espe-
cially in the final moments of the game, but
they’ve been there before. ‘

Why even have Graves in there at all? He had

only played three minutes up until that point,
while Yuri Demetris had played almost the entire

second half While Brown was out with four fouls. -

Not that Demetris should have taken the final
shot —— he’s been extremely reluctant to shoot as
of late ‘— but he had to have been looser than
Graves.

Forget for a moment that perhaps someone
else should have taken the final shots. What do
these missed shots do to Graves’ psyche?

The team and his coach may be telling him
that it’s all right, but that doesn’t mean the same
thoughts are going through the young man’s

head. There have to be moments when he putsthe ‘

blame on himself.

did everything it could to try to win against the

‘Huskies, and it didieverything it could to lose

against the Pirates. How many teams can really

times? .
Pitt had to have a bad game eventually, and
it’s better to have it now, when there is still a
tomorrow, than during the month of March. But
the fact that the Panthers still had a chance to win
and couldn’t pull it out is disheartening.
A With different personnel on the ﬂoor and the
ball in a more experienced .player’s' hands, per-
haps things might have been a little different.

Senior Nicole Vann and freshman
Justin Clickett led the Panthers as
they steamrolled over the competi-
tion, en route to six event titles and
24 top-five finishes in the State Farm
Games, in Morgantown, W.Va., this
past weekend.

Clickett set a personal‘ record

1 with a throw of 16.54 meters in the

shot put and won the event by a full
two meters over freshman_teammate
Eduardo Ruiz, who had a throw of
14.54 meters. Clickett also placed
second in the 20-pound weight throw,
with a toss of 15.06 meters.

“I’m really happy with the way
his training has come along,” said
Alonzo VWebb, the head coach of the
men’s and women’s indoor track
team. “Justin is such a competitor 
[and] really put on a show this week-
end.”

Matt Brousse and Clinton Kotuby
also had great meets for the Panthers.

Brousse broke the school record
in the pole Vault, with a height of
5.00 meters, finishing in front of
sophomore teammate Jared Leese.
Kotuby won the 3,000-meter run
with a time of 8:54:26.

said.‘ “He is a special kid, and it was
great to see him perform well this
weekend.”

Chris Anderson, a sophomore,
also had a solid meet. He placed sec-
ond in the 200—meter dash with a
time of 22.26 seconds and finished
third in the 60-meter dash with a time
of 7.03 seconds.

“Chris is going to be special; he
is going to be one of the top runners
in the country when he is done,” said
Webb. “This best thing about Chris is
he keeps getting better.” '

Senior Ryan Smith placed fourth
in the 200—meter dash with a time of
22.95 seconds and rounded out the
top five in the 400-meter dash with a
time of 51.75 seconds.‘

The women’s team was lead by
Nicole Vann, who won the long jump
with a distance of 5.65 meters and
placed fourth in the 60-meter hurdles
with a time of-8.17.

“Nicole is trying out a new event

and had her best jump of the year,”

said Webb. “She is really motivated I

right now, and it is coming at the per-
fect time.”

The Panthers got huge contribu-
tions from star freshmen Fatmata
Fofonah and Krystal Epps. Fofonah

, .

placed first in the 60-meter hurdles
with a time of 7.94, and Epps won
the 800—meter run with a time of
2:15:96.

“Fatmata had the third fastest
time in conference and is getting into
top form just in time for her Big East
run,” said Webb. “Krystal is so tal-

ented and one of the best athletes on .

the team, but she still has a lot to
learn.”

Freshman Kim Rorabaugh placed
third in the 20-pound weight throw,
with a throw of 114.41 meters.
Rorabaugh also finished fourth in the
shot put, with a toss of 12.33 meters.

Webb went into the State Farm
Games hoping to let his younger ath-

_letes get some valuable experience,

and the underclassmen placed first in
two different events and finished in
the top five 10 times.

“They did a tremendous job, and
we are going to count on them in the
Big East Indoor Championships,”

. said Webb

7 The Panthers return to action
next weekend at the Penn State
Challenge Cup at State College, Pa.

“We are going into next week’s
meet doing what is best for our pro-
gram, and [we will] prepare [our
team] for the Big East tournament,”
said Webb. .
