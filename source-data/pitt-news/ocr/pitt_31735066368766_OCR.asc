University Cleared In Bookstore Firings

By MARK A. SINDLER
The Pennsylvania Labor Rela-

tions Board (PLRB) has ruled that _

Pitt was not wrong in the ﬁring of
two Book Center employees in early
January.

The decision, made on June 21,
exonerated Pitt of allegation made
by the Allegheny Joint Regional
Board (AJRB) in an unfair labor
practice suit. AJ RB charged the uni-
versity with thwarting unionizing
attempts that were being made by
the two ﬁred employees.

The AJ RB has been representing
fired employees Charles Delaney
and Tim Brady since early January.

Along with Delaney and Brady,

- Norma Dothard and William Cox

were also suspended for one day
each on Jan. 6 for not working over-

BAS,PPC
Advisers
Named

Pitt’s Black Action Society will
once again have a permanent adviser
when the Office of Student Activi-
ties welcomes its new assistant direc-
tor on July 18.

Mr. James Raymond, current
director of activities and programs
at Duquesne University, will be
moving to Pitt next month to
become assistant director of student
activities and adviser to BAS. Ray-
mond will also be the primary
adviser to the College of General
Studies‘ student goverment.

BAS has been without a full-time
adviser since Sarah Brown left that
position in the fall of 1982, taking a
medical leave of absence from which
she has never returned. Stephan
Broadus, coordinator of athletic
facilities, has served as acting BAS
adviser in the interim.

The Office of Student Activities
began the process of searching for

Brown's replacement in February,
1983. Over 50 candidates responded
to the position opening which was
advertised nationally for five weeks.
Seven prospects were interviewed
here in May from which Raymond
was chosen. _

The challenges of a major univer-
sity, especially one within the city of
Pittsburgh, enticed Raymond to
leave Duquesne where he had been
since I971. ’

“I thought it time for a new chal-
lenge and the position will give me a
chance to socialize in one or two
particular areas," Raymond said.

Raymond met twice with a com-
mittee of BAS students during. the
interviewing process, and he thinks
that the group's major priority in the
next year is the recruitment of new
members.

(PPC) also recently welcomed a new

time hours during a “rush period”at
the bookstore, Jan. 4.‘

Delaney and Brady, however,
were two of the more active
employees seeking union-card sign-
ing during the last
December.

Delaney was fired at the book-
store on Jan. 10 for what Pitt said
was his refusal to report back to
work for a mandatory overtime
assignment and for threats of bodily
harm to shipping and receiving
supervisor Jesse Peters.

Brady was also given notice of his
firing of the same day for refusing a
mandatory overtime assignment, in
addition to making “scurrilous and
obscene" allegations concerning

Ten years ago, someone at the
University of Pittsburgh School
of Music thought it a good idea
to build a recording studio here.
Two weeks ago, the university’s
Board of Trustees approved a
budget that said yes to the idea in
the form of $10,000 in funding.

A proposal submitted for
review two years ago by music
department chairman Don
Franklin, music director Nathan
Davis and electronics technician
Rich Schulz has been formally
approved, and work will begin
shortly with the hope of finishing
at least a major part of thestudio
by late September.

"Heavy student interest helped
in the approval of the plans,“ ,
Schulz, classical concert director
at the school said. “The full bal-

insubordinately towards Peter.

In the eight-page report by hear-
ing examiner Elliot Newman, it was
disclosed that another supervisor,
assistant Book Center director Peter
Sollento made the final decisioon on
Brady's and Delaney’s terminations.
Sollento had no knowledge at the
time the report said, of initial union
activity in the bookstore.

Newman’s final report contained
many derogatory and slanderous
statements made by both Delaney
and Brady to their immediate super-
iors as recorded during testimony in
the two-day hearing.

Peters testified that “Delaney and
Brady began to discuss how

smoothly Jimmy Hoffa had been

ance of the funding is going
exclusively to new equipment so
we will have a pretty good system
ready by [fall].”

The .new studio will include a
top-quality PA system, a 12-
channel audio mixer and an 8-
track studio recording system.
The plans for the new facility
were designed to augment exist-
ing equipment already housed in
the Music Building.

The facility will initially be
used by the university jazz band
and for departmental concerts.
Later, projects involving other
staff members and students will
have access to the studio.

Another use of the studio will
be for the making of university-
wide, non-profit record masters.

“We certainly will not be able
to press records,“ Shulz said,

ing up and people being rubbed

his presence, Peters said.

Newman’sv findings include the
fact that purported union activities
was not a factor in the decision of the
two discharges and that Brady and
Delaney, on several occasions, ques-
tioned whatever Peters‘ authority.

“Mr. Sollento’s decision,” New-
man wrote, “was grounded in his
concern for the safety of his supervi-
sors and the smooth running of the
store."

This latest decision by the PLRB
permits unionizing efforts to con-
tinue, but not on a fragmented basis,
according to University Counsel
Ron Talarico.

be further processed [into
records].”

The music department is plan-
ning to offer a small, directed-
study program in studio and
recording techniques to take
advantage of the new facilities.
School administrators think that
these modern skills, allied with
the department’s already strong
music theory and mechanics
background, will give Pitt stu-
dents majoring in music a boost
in marketability after gradua-
tion. A little-known facility
already in existence here‘ is the
Computerized Electronic Music
Studio (CEMS). The CEMS
uses a DEC-LS1 ll computer
which when digitally interfaced
with various sound synthesizers
allows composers to experiment
with the creation and recording
ima inable sound.

“We have no problem with facing
an election of a union which could
possibly represent such a large
group,” Talarico said.‘ “You don’t
want to have over-fragmentation;
you want to have an appropriate
sized unit.”

“It clears the way for there to be
another hearing on the proper unit,”
he said earlier. “Or in other words, a
unit determination hearing. We feel
very strongly, based on some of the
last union organization attempts,
that that type of unit (a separate,
confined type) would be inapprop-
riate and the board would so rule."

Talarico said that there are many,
reasons why the university prefers
larger and more encompassing
unions overall. Two include “com-

The symbol of the University of
Pittsburgh—the panther——remains
at the center of an ongoing legal bat-
tle between Pitt and Champion Pro-
ducts lnc., a merchandiser of an
array of jackets, T-shirts, and other
softgoods bearing the logo.

In his most recent ruling, U.S.
District Judge Maurice Cohill last
week refused Pitt’s request that
Champion be required to enter into
a licensing agreement with the
university.

Cohill said that Pitt’s request

“amounts to a judicially created,

perpetual monopoly on a product,
Pitt insignia softgoods, which many
people want to buy.”

The university currently has
trademark licensing agreements
with approximately 75 companies,
all of which pay a $100 license fee
and royalties of 6 percent, according
to university legal counsel Ronald
Talarico.

The university originally filed suit
seeking an injunction against Cham-
pion‘s continued selling of any unli-
censed goods bearing Pitt
trademarks in December of I98],
according to Talarico. On Jan. 7,
l982, Cohill rejected Pitt’s request
for an injunction, and the university
then appealed the decision to the 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The
appellate court sent the case back to
Judge Cohill who again ruled
against Pitt.

“We are very disappointed in the
judge's decision,” Talarico said.
“Our preliminary review of his deci-
sion leads us to believe that he is
totally incorrect."

The implications of the suit far
exceed in importance the money
that would be generated by Cham-

    Barry Mitnick,InnovativeInstructor“

By WES COTTER .

Innovative teaching in the gradu-
ate school of business was recog-
nized recently when a Professor
Barry M. Mitnick was given a Free-
doms Foundation Award for excel-
lence in education.

Strategic/ Managerial Behavior in
Business Government Relations is
the name of Mitnick’s course. He
explained that in his class graduate
students learn about managing the
business environment by studying
government regulation.

“I use a portfolio approachf my
teaching methods give a managerial
approach that gives students a
chance to think about tactics and
strategy.”

Mitnick said people are subject to
things like safety and health legisla-
tion and he teaches how to react to
it.

The use of colorful examples is,
according to Mitnick, one of his
most effective tools in teaching. An
example of an interesting case study
Mitnick. uses in his class is the regu-
lation of ﬂutter balls and birdie balls
by the Consumer Product Safety
Commission.

“I try to develop generalizations
and build from there.” Mitnick said.

His class is currently an elective
that is offered to graduate students

Get that  
Great “:6”

and also MBAs and even under-
grads at select times.

The class was recently changed
from a required class to an elective
which has dramatically reduced the
number of students. Mitnick said
over a thousand students have taken
this class in two years, but now with
the change his average class size has
dropped from 200 to 12.

“The class has been very success-
ful and I've gotten excellent feed-
back and response from students on
how this material is applied.

“I pulled together the pieces I
wanted I adopted and adapted it
from colleges; it wasn’t original with
me,” he said in explaining the crea-
tion of his teaching style. I

“We have to deal with regulations
and how this affects competitors,”

Mitnick said. “Some firms are better M

able to comply with regulation.”

Mitnick received a $7,500 cash
incentive award for his work and
said he is grateful for it with an
expanding family of twins and
another coming in September.

Mitnick’s academic career started
at MIT where he received his under-
graduate degree in physics; he
received his masters in physics
science at the University of Pennsyl-
vania and then received a Ph.D.
from Penn.

Mitnick taught at Ohio State in

tration and moved to Pitt in 1978.
He received the title of associate pro-
fessor in 1980 and says he’s happy at
the university.

Mitnick also is involved in
research and has-— written a book
entitled “The Political Economy of
Regulation.” He said the book is a
large volume that deals with the
birth, development and removal of
regulations.

In addition to this he has also
written many articles which ,deal
with government business regula-
tion dealings. ‘

Aspects of Mitnick’s research are

very new and ground-breaking in"

the field of studying theories of the
agency. The first paper written on
this subject was presented to the
public in 1973. Mitnick’s Ph.D. dis-

  

sertation in 1974 deal with the
agency organizational system.

“Mine was the first in this area. I
was one of the first to write on the
agency,” he said.

The award received was given to
only 19 people nationwide. Donna
Wood, who is also a member of the
Graduate School of Business, won
the same award last year. Wood one
for her proposal on writing issue
briefs as a teaching tool.

Mitnick said both awards will

‘help the Graduate School of Busi-

ness become a “top notch place."
He added that if people found out
about the quality of the program,
the reputation of new teaching will‘
rise.

one of the few schools whose faculty
are this active and busy.”

The prominence of the faculty in"a-

this school isn’t well known, accord-
ing to Mitnick, even though Pitt is
probably the only school to have
two members on the governance
committee of the National Academy
of Management. In addition to this,
Pitt has a number of members in
committees in this same academy.

“We have carved out a particular
niche here and we hope we can
attract the best Ph.D. ‘s with it," Mit-
nick said.

The Graduate School of Business
will move to its new home, Mervis ‘
Hall, in August. Mitnick said he is
excited about the new building, but
not the move. The amount of mate- J
rial he has to move is, according to
him, “considerable."

“There's a lot of us academic chip-

, munks," he said, “holding on to aca-

demic nuts for papers we may
write.”

Talarico said. “Both of us have spent
more money on this case than we

Talarico said the university will

“This case turns primarily on

“Champion feels that they have been

staff member. Ric Fogle took over
as program coordinator on June 6,
relocating Jimmy Gilliland, who
had served in the position for the
past two years.

Fogle comes to Pitt from the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin-LaCrosse

‘where he obtained a master’s degree

in education. the branch campus ,at
LaCrosse had a student population
of little more than 8,000 and an
atmosphere Fogle described as
“isolated.”

“It is much more urban here at A

Pitt,” Fogle said, “The people are

much more sophisticated. At

LaCrosse, no matter what (pro-
gramming) you brought, people had

never seen it before.”

Fogle will assist PPC adviser Gina
Miller in overseeing the 13 standing
committees made up of PPC volun-
teer students.

“I suspect he (Fogle) brings with
him new ideas because he has seen
programming done at a different
institution,” Miller said, “but there
will be no structural changes.”

Fogle hopes to take advantage of
the broad audience offered by Pitt’s
diverse student body with a variety
of programming.

“People here have more sophisti-
cated taste, and they are more dis-
criminating,” Fogle said. “There’s
much more of an appeal for foreign
films of jazz at Pitt. None of those
things do well at LaCrosse.”

“We’re still conducting an organiz-
ing campaign and have scheduled a

we’re moving toward and election,
one which we intend to win.”

Scheid said he and his associates

“I think there’s a lot of disap-
pointed people at the Book Center,”
Scheid said. “I think they believe

nated for their union activity, and
it’s a worry now because we’ve gone
through the Pennsylvania Labor
Relations Board process, and the
board determined rightfully or
wrongfully that Brady and Delaney
were not terminated for union
activity.”

Scheid said he believes that the
PLRB‘s deccision on Brady's and
Delaney’s employment status will
not affect the bookstore’s efforts in
gaining union recognition as part of

rico said, “and I thing the answer is
the people thought they’d be better
off without a union. They were being
treated fairly, and there was no need
for union. '

“You know, unions usually come
into play when employees feel they
are being neglected or have needs
that aren’t being met."

Clerical workers on campus
would include those at the book-
store, and there was an agreement
four years ago when clericalworkers
voted in majority to not gain repres-
entation through labor unions.

And there are further reasons,

I Talarico said, why Pitt would only
accept larger unions for representa-

tion of such work groups as clerical
workers.

“The way the university works,’
he continued, “clerks can transfer in
and out of position very freely and
on a very common basis.

“So you’ll have l7 in a union
which voted for it and all ofa sudden
next month six will transfer out to
another divisin. There’s a lot of that
here. That’s why you should have a
university-wide union if you have
one at all.”

  Opinion

Big Business

Pitt is changing, slowly moving away from
what we usually mean by “school”—a place

‘where teachers teach and students study.

In recent years, as demands for their services
have extended beyond the campus, universities
have become more like businesses. Research con-
tracts have long been used to make academic
expertise available to industry and bring revenue
to participating schools. Now schools like Pitt are
creating new legal structures—foundations and
non-profit corporations—.,to financially protect
their research endeavors.

Just as university research is being streng-
thened, educational programs are allowed to
wither. At Pitt, reports of department and pro-
gram cutbacks have become uncomfortably
familiar.

State funding for Pitt willilikely increase by
only 2 percent above last year’s level, while inﬂa-
tion last year ran at about 4 percent, and is not
expected to be much higher this year.

In response to this funding outlook, Pitt's fiscal
wizards have called for a 9.5 percent increase for
most students here. Combined with the admit-
tedly small state funding gain, the tuition increase
would give Pitt a larger budget in 1984 than in
1983. In other words, Pitt would have to grow to
absorb that much money.

Why, then, has the budget of the Faculty of
Arts -and Sciences—the administrative heart of
teaching programs at Pitt—been so sharply cut?
It cannot be because funds are not available. It is
clear that there will be more money, not less, next
year. The answer must be that the university has
decided to channel a large amount of the stu-

“Let’s get physical” is more than
just a title of a favorite song‘of
teenyboppers; it's the idea behind
thousands of college students who
are pushing, pulling and lifting their
bodies into shape.

. On the Pitt.campus, residents of
fraternity houses have moved
weightlifting equipment into extra
rooms, and dedicated lifters have
transformed some Towers lounges
into weightrooms. i

Weightlifting and bodybuilding
magazines ﬂood the display racks in
Oakland stores, and there is
someone who “lifts" in almost every
group.

According to Dan McGovern, an
adviser at Pitt Barbell and Health
Food Corporation, weightlifting is at
the height of its popularity.

' “lt’s the thing of the '80s,"
McGovern said. “The entire health
and fitness thing is incredible.”

The basic idea behind
weightlifting, he said, is to “work fat
into muscle. You’re tightening up
everything.”

Past a certain age, the number of
muscle cells and fibers in the human
body no longer increases with

exercise. Instead, the muscle cells S

respond to physical stress (like
lifting beyond one’s limit) by
increasing in size. This is called
muscle hypertrophy.

A muscle will increase its degree
of hypertrophy in response to the
application of an overload. Such an
overload is provided by increasing
the intensity of resistance applied to
each muscle—by going against your
muscles and picking up dead

weight.

tures

The intensity of an exercise is
increased by increasing the weight
used in an exercise and by
increasing the number of repetitions
in each exercise.

Weightlifting has been going on
for about 100 years, but it was Char-
les Atlas who originally promoted
the exercise in the 1920s. One of the
ways he publicized it was through
his magazine, Strength.

The first step in starting a weight-
lifting program is setting your goals,
McGovern said. Goals are usually
set for bulk, speed and ﬂexibility as
well as for strength.

“You have to know what you
want and what you're going for," he
said.

After one’s goals are set, one
usually starts with a program of
basic exercises, like bench presses,
curls and squats. Bench presses
consist of lying on a bench, packing
weights on a bar and lifting it. These
help to build one.'s chest and
shoulders.

The “curl” is an exercise in which
one starts with’ barbells in both

weightlifting when he is about 12 or

13, but that some people start in
their 405 and 50s.

“Anybody can do it," he said.
“Girls are even getting into it."

That’s somewhat of an
understatement. Lineman has
noticed that women are starting to
lift weights, and that it has become
more popular in the United States
and on the Pitt campus. She was the
only girl who worked out at Trees
Hall at the beginning of last fall, but
now she sees more girls using the
weight facilities. “

‘‘If you read Mademoiselle and
Glamour, they're pushing it a lot
more," she said. 4

She said she doesn’t think weight-
lifting will fade out soon as a popular
means of getting in shape-
especially for women.

“Weightlifting for women is new,”
she said. “Men have been doing it
for quite a while. I think women are
just realizing the kind of results they
get from it and how it improves the
way they look. .

hands, bringing them from the
thighs to the shoulders. This is
designed to develop the biceps.

McGovern calls squats “one of
your most important exercises.”
They work on the upper thighs and
legs.‘ '

The more well-defined you want
to become, the higher the weight
and lower repetition you should use.

Muscle definition and cut is
usually associated with body-
building
, which increases not only strength
but muscle size. 

“You can’t bodybuild without
weightlifting,” McGovern said.

“You do a different type of
exercise and lift with the weight
[when you bodybuild],” said Charla
Lineman, an award-winning
bodybuilder and recent Pitt
graduate.

“lt's excellent for keeping your
body in shape,” she said. “You can
mold your body yourself. You’re in
control of what your body is doing.”

When starting a weightlifting
program, McGovern said you have
to see how strong you are and what
you can already do.

“The basic idea is to work out
with something [you] can strain to
do,” he said. “Most people who
want to get into weightlifting are
more than your 98-pound
weaklings.”

When an athlete stops exercising
and his muscles seem to change into
fat, it's because he eats the same
amount of food as he did when he
was lifting. The muscle itself doesn't
turn into fat. 2

McGovern said one should start

 
   
 

“Women are always looking for
something to help control their
weight or something to firm their
thighs. It's never been acceptable
for a woman to weightlift because it
seems so masculine.

“Now the world is seeing not all
women are becoming masculine
and huge,” she said. ‘‘It improves
your appearance. For that reason, I
think it will be around for a while.”

‘‘It keeps me in shape,” said one

21-year-old Pittsburgh girl who goes
to school in Daytona Beach. ‘‘It’s the
next best thing to running. It makes
me look good, [and] it makes me feel
good.
“You ﬁgure, where I go to school,
people pay attention to how you
look," she said. ‘‘I don’t think it's a
fad or a big deal. People who want to
do it do it.” .

Many people are doing it at
institutions that concentrate on
total figure control like Elaine
Powers and Nautilus.

Elaine Powers spas feature a
circuit weight training program in
which weightlifting equipment
works on the upper part of the body.
Their program includes pull-down
machines, dumbbells for the arms
and chest and a butterﬂy machine
for the pectoral area.

Nautilus centers (one of which is
located in Oakland) feature a
variable-resistance weight program.
This compensates for the strengths
and weaknesses of the body.

According to Nautilus theory,
you have to exhaust the larger
muscles (beginning with your hips
and back) so they don’t help out the
smaller ones, such as those located
in the arms and wrists.

— There are two full circuits of
Nautilus equipment, each
consisting of 12 machines. You do
one set on each machine until the
point of failure, when the muscles
work so hard they can’t do
anymore.

I‘

McGovern said that so-called
spot exercises, designed to work on
one particular part of the body, are
not effective unless they are part of a
larger program.

“There's no such thing as spot-
reducing,” he said. “You can’t just
lose it [in one place]. The whole
body has to do it.”

He said that “into-it” weightlifters
work out three days a week. They
lift every other day because “they're
resting their muscles [so] they’re
ready to go again.”

Lineman, however, works out for
two or two and a half hours five days
a week. In addition, she tries to run
about four miles during the day,
which complements the body-
building.

“That’s as important as
weightlifting itself," McGovern said
of jogging and other athletic
activities.

“Nutrition is a big part of it," he
said. “You're working out and using
more energy and you need a
supplement,” he said. He advises
lifters to eat bulky foods and take
multi-vitamins.

Lineman eats a lot of fruits and
vegetables, high grain and high
protein foods. She avoids salt, sugar
and fats and also takes protein
supplements.

exercise set with a bar and weights
and a leg curl, often used by the

 

beginner.

110-lb. vinyl weight sets can be
bought, though, for about $33-at
some discount department stores.
Steel 110-lb. weight sets are more
expensive, costing $100-$150 at
discount stores.

Weight benches begin around
$25, and good bench presses run
around $70. Weights cost about 50¢

a pound, and dumbbell bars go from
$8 to about $25 a pair. A good 120-
lb. barbell will cost about $137 at a
good sporting goods store.

A new system of weightlifting,

by pulling your own body weight at
various angles, is available for about
$695 at some sporting goods stores.

The summer hours for the weight

1 a complete set of Universal weight-

lifting equipment, are: Monday-
Thursday, 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
and 3:30 p.m. to 9 p.m.; Friday,

BABY
The Suburban Lawns
I.R.S.

Some of today's bands hon-
estly seem to want to stretch
their musical limbs and try very
hard to create a sound that's
both unique but not too‘ inac-
cessible to scare a potential
audience away; but some
groups get this goal mixed up in
artsy posturings and end up
spending far too much time
primping for glaring photos and
buying the latest fashion togs,
or, even, pretending like they
don't care at all about what
they look like, in which case
they usually end up either lucky
(The Talking Heads, whose
music rightly takes precedence
over the image) or otherwise
(Human Switchboard, who, if
you can believe it, have even a
lesser visual image than the
Talking Heads). The Suburban
Lawns fall somewhere between
the hard-working band and the
artsy-fartsy type. Which leaves
this mini lp, Baby, grasping for
something concrete to hold
onto. .

Baby contains five songs; only
one is a total waste—something
called ”Cowboy,” which sounds

prove an occupational hazard.
Shriekback’s nucleus is three
”x”s—Dave Allen , late of Gang
of Four; Barry Andrews, for-
merly of XTC; and Carl Marsh,
from the defunct Out On Blue
Six. Along with various
drummers and percussionists,
they've produced Care, a collec-
tion of ten numbers, co-
authored by the core members.
The songs were developed in
the studio and built onto pre-
outlined bass and drum tracks
to allow for ”spontaneity,”
according to Marsh, although
the outlines are evident. The
tunes are largely dependent on
bass riffs and rhythmic effects
(repetitive to the point of
monotony on some cuts), as
well as synthesizer stylings.

Vocals are mostly unison, not

too strong and in the back-

ground. Lyrics are good, occa-

\.

thesizers? Just dreadful. The
other four tracks aren't half
bad, or, maybe they are exactly
that: half bad. While parts of the
songs work-—the chorus parts,
usually,—others don't. It's like
50 percent sounds like it should
and the remaining 50 percent
was just thrown in to make the
song longer. Only one track,
”Flavor Crystals” (no, I have no
idea what it means, either), has
a higher percentage of good
parts than bad parts. The music
is indescribable, even though
the band goes in for lots of elec-
tronic gadgetry. But, I do like
two things about this record:
lead singer Su Tissue's voice-
whimsical but dead serious, and
the cover design——a large-dot
blow—up photo of a baby who
looks like the star of a '60s hor-
ror movie.

Altered Images are an Anglo

pop fluff, instantly forgettable
except for its introduction of
songstress Clare Grogtan. She's

overcome the many legal battles
with the various recording lab-
els, the king of funk and the
mastermindbehind Parliament,
Funkadelic, Brides of Funken-
stein, Parlet, and Bootsy’s
Rubber Band is back. This effort
labels Clinton as solo artist, but
that was just a way of staying
out of legal troubles, because
the crazy P-Funk ensemble have
all gathered together. The cast
includes Bootsy Collins and
Junie Morrison, both of whom
are now pursuing solo careers
after learning, then borrowing
from black pop’s funky Cecil B.
DeMille.

Clinton tells his cohorts to
”Get Dressed" on the opening
cut on the album, as they are
about to transform themselves
into many guises. They begin
with a dog in ”Man’s Best
Friend,” a humorous prelude to
another creature which arises
from the dark black synthesized
grooves calling itself ”Loopsilla”
as it surfaces with its many
heads. As the back beat belches"

strains of ”Planet Rock," ”Sugar

Planet Rock, we just don't stop!
we're gonna drive you nuts.”___‘

/MANIACS

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

The moguls of Tinseltown are at it again, trying to entice you into the
theatre box (like a roach motel) and——zap—pull your wallet while you're
busy buying stale popcorn and Saudi Arabian priced Coke. Their schemes
are, ridiculous, but only if you're dumb enough or bored enoughvto actually
believe that you'll enjoy watching 120 minutes or so of rebel space warrior
wielding glowing swords, over-the-hill secret spy agents who always get
the girl, or the adventures of a lovesick superhero. The year's worst movies

..are usually released during the summer season and 1983 isn't any excep-
tion. I'm probably taking my life in my hands, when I say this but, take my
advice and wait for Return of the Jedi to run on HBO before you see it. The
outrageous price ($4.50 here, $5.00 in most major cities) is hardly worth
your time. George Lucas took a good thing and ran it into the ground with
this one. Cute creatures and cuddly extra terrestrials abound to the point
where you'll feel like Children's Palace's stuffed animals department has

come to life in a nightmarish way. Even the best part of the Star Wars '
epic—-the horribly wonderful character known as Darth Vader—is dashed .

to bits. Lucas is talkinglabout retiring from the movie business and, in light

of this, that might not be such a bad idea.....Superman III is-—brace yoursel-f— _

even worse than Iedi! An almost non-existent story line that looks suspi-
ciously like it was 'tal<en.i—n bits and pieces from old footage from the first

two movies is edited together so choppily -that the film only gets off the _
ground when Reeve flies with the help of superficial supports. A big deal is J‘

being made about Richard Pryor’s inclusionin the movie, but even he can't
begin to salvage this mess. ‘If any other actor had taken his role—t_hat of a
«computer whiz wh-o's blackmailed into taking over theworld and destroy-
ing Superman—-there would havebeen no laughs whatsoever, but even
though Pryor’s own special style and uncanny timing shine through, the
-character just isn'-t vey funny or very likable to begin with. Notably absent
is Margot Kidder’s Lois Lane, who appears for about two seconds at the
film's beginning and is then carted off to Bermuda for vacation. Replacing

her ‘as the ‘hero's love interest is Annette O'Toole, whose character of a 1

small‘-town widow with a young child to raise alone is so listless and

vacuous that you wish he'd have left her back inSmalltovv‘.n, U.S.A. and ‘

wished her good luck. Reeve . is his usual cartoonish self, grinning boyishly
land g_rimac:i_ng at all the right moments (when he's frozen by a,l<rypton'ray,

Roger Moore and Mae dams star in the latest James Bond adventure,
Octopussy.

goddamned nice all the time! This series has, hopefully, reached the end of p

its life (Reeve says he won't do any more Superman movies) so, if you have

the misfortune of seeing Superman Ill, take consolation by remembering that ~

there probably won't be a Superman IV....James Bond hasn't been the same
since Sean Connery left to pursue a broader acting experience, but that's
old news and we've had to make do with Mr. Plastic himself, Roger Moore,

for years. It's not that Moore isn't good-looking enough or charming ,

enough,-A indeed, that 's his_"problem”: he's good-looking and charming, but

that’s.all. Connery certainly wasn't as handsome, but he had more text_ure: -
he gave the character, who¥'s really second-fiddle to spy weapons and ‘
gadgets and exotic locations, some depth. Th-is problemsis still evidentin the -
latest Bond adventure, Octopussy, but, despite the obvious drawbacks 
. (Moore, the repetition of the saga, etc.,) it's the best Bond movie in years. A

The pace is ur_u.isua'l‘ly_quick,'the story is smooth and intriguing, and there

aren't nearly as many dim-witted hussies as there were in previous epi.- A
sodes. Former model "Maude Adams in the title role is unique for two '

reasons: first, because she is the first Bond Girl to appear in two of the
series (she was also in Man With a Golden Gun}, and second, because her
character is drastically different from the roles women are usually assigned
in 007 movies. Her character isn't merely the girlfriend/mistress of some

arch "Bond villain, nor is she a simpering lovely who tries to seduce the -
agent. She plays a very ‘independent, very wealthy lady who is b'as'ica_flly ..

good, although her business dealings are -somewhat shady. Octopussy

' takes some of the stra-in off of Moore by being an integral part of the movie ‘

and not just some minor diversion. Thus, it's as-if there are two stories and
two characters to root forinstead of just one.‘ Some fans may be disap-

pointed by the lack of super spy "toys" (a metal-cornsur‘-ning acid pen, a"

watch with a closed circuit t.v. screen, and a hot air balloon are hardly’
impressive for James Bond!), but, other than that, most will agree ‘that

V being 007 is still the most exciting job in the world....

‘MIDNIGHT MOVIES

By Stuart Samuels
Collier Books

After midnight, it's a different
world out there. Solid daylight real-
ity turns into something insubstan-
tial, giving way to a shadow-filled
mystery in which curious figures
loom up, in which the unexpected
becomes the order-of—things.

And a different reality requires a

“different entertainment. After mid-

night, for example, the cinema
becomes the province of the mid-
night movies—weird assemblages of
strange or shocking sights and
sounds that don't tell stories as much
as they seem to bore into the precon-
scious mind and strike a resonant
note with that mind's darkest desires,

 its most flippant fantasies.

Stuart Samuels is'Ta useful introduc'- '

tion to the midnight movie pheno-

menon. After a sociologically-o_rient- '

- ed opening in which he tracesthe rise

A of midnight movies out of the anti-
‘establishment ‘needs of '60s youth.

Samuels analyzes nine films that
have become classics of the midnight
movie circuit: El Topo, The Rocky Horror
Picture Show, Harold and Maude, Eraser-
head, King of Hearts, Night of the Living
Dead, Pink Flamingoes, Reefer Madness,
a_nd The Harder They Come. The book's
=one‘_}rna-jor flaw is its failure toexplain

«its limitation‘  these choices .(how“_
could any "book on the m-idnightlg

AND THEN THERE WAS DUCK
By Iohn Ward

Pocket Books
"John Ward studied ducks for two

weeks in the wilds of Northern Cali-
fornia," and was presumably inspired
to develop And Then There Was Duck.
”In the beginning there wasn't
much..." says the cover. Nor at the
end; Duck is a cartoon book deriving
its humor from guess which bird,
perhaps hoping to do for the duck
what B. Kliban or Jim Davis has done
for the cat.

But Ward's collection is an unsuc-
cessful marriage of uninspired draw-
ings and puns/plays-on—words/non
sequiturs pertaining to ducks. Unlike
Kliban, the drawings here are neither
amusing nor detailed enough to elicit

films became midnight classics and he
perceptively links such accounts to
analyses of scenes, themes and styles
in the films. For example, he treats
the success of Night of the Living Dead
not just as a result of its achieve-
ments in horror—film conventions,
but also in relation to its social con-
text: an America which was becom-

ing simultaneously more violent and -

more zombified. Even if the fact that
each film seems to have its very spe-
cific brand of spectator (for example,
ther is no one else in the world like a
Rocky Horror Picture Show fan) would
suggest that each film locks into very
specific sorts of taste, Samuels sug-
gestively argues that all the films are
saying something very explicit about

today's America, about its hopes and .

dreams, about its’ fuailures and
excesses. '

much humorous response; unlike
Davis's Garfield character, Ward's
various ducks lack individualized
personalities. .

You remember "Duck, Duck,
Goose.” Throw in ”Sir Francis
Drake” (admittedly a good one) and
all the words like ”seduction” and
"production;" add sort-of puns like
”earthquack" and ”Roman aquaduck"
and ”the duck stops here;" mix in the
occasional ”little rubber person," and
you've got And Then There Was Duck.
Unfortunately, Ward stretches a few
fun ideas too far.

York."

OK. So how do you deal with this
anxiety? A helpful starting place
might be William D. Leight’s The I
Hate New York Guidebook, an insider's
viewpoint/survival handbook about
the Big Apple.

The guidebook offers a tongue-in-
cheek, good-humored tour of the key
aspects of daily New York existence:
travelling ("every morning the entire
subway system is hosed down with a
urine-scented disinfectant”); spend-
ing money (”the city is a cash-sucking

GRANDE ILLUSIONS: A learn-by-
example guide tojthe art and tech-
nique of special make-up effects
By“ Tom Savini

At the grosser of today's horror
films, you'll sometimes hear a run-
ning commentary that goes some-
thing like this: "Oh my god, that's
disgusting!" Then, several seconds
later, from the same person: ”How
did they do that?” Tom Savini’s book,
Grande Illusions, answers that question
in loving detail.

Pittsburgh-based Savini is the spe-
cial effects king of the "splatter
movie" (that branch of horror film
that luxuriates in the ability to come
up with endless, gruesome, blood-
splattering (hence the name) effects).
It's all in this book: the screwdriver in
the neck trick (Dawn of the Dead), the
pitchfork through the chin (The
Prowler), the axe in the head (Friday the
13th), the stake in the heart (Martin),
the cockroaches through the cheek
(Creepshow), etc., etc.

In living, blood-red color, Savini
displays the technical background of

j //7‘

Little Rubber Person

apartment living and dining out (’’if

' your bathtub were in your kitchen

would you want to eat at home?”).
Neighborhoods and their varied

attractions are discussed,’ along with

strategy and tactics for those who

‘ simply must live in the city. The Man-

hattan S.A.T. (Survival Aptitude
Test) poses such intriguing questions
as: "You witness a purse snatching.
Like a good Samaritan, you start run-
ning after the mugger. Much to your
chagrin, you find yourself catching
up with him. What should you do?"
The author is a native of the city,
and for all his passionate name-
calling, the book is a bluff; his grudg-
ing love for the place is obvious. The I '
Hate New York Guidebook is a different
variation on the traditional tour”
guide, likely to amuse the novice as
well as the initiated New Yorker_.'D.
Leightful. _
RICHARD SATER

such elaborate effects, showing
would-be filmmakers how they, too,
can make heads explode, fangs pro-R
trude, wounds gush. Savini provides
details about supplies, make-up, actor
psychology (for example, how to calm
an actor to whom you're attaching an
exploding stomach) but is careful to
note those effects that would be
beyond the budget of an amateur.

Many of the effects Savini describes '

reach beyond the grotesque, but
somehow it's reassuring to learn that
they are just effects: the book de-
mystifies the shockpf the new horror
film and shows how much of a science
making people jump out of their seats
and spill their popcorn all over the
place can be.

But one implication of that de-
mystification is truly scary: if this
book teaches us how to look more
critically and with greater emotional
distance at violent screen death, will
that mean that horror films will have
to go even further, finding new ways
to trick us and gross us out?

I isy CHARLIE O'HARA

In recentmonths, the New Image
Track Club and Clinton Davis have
become as familiar to Pittsburghers
as the born-again Pirates and their
nine-game win streak. ‘

The obvious key to this recent
popularity has been the team's
success of late. '

More speciﬁcally, it can "be
attributed Ito the ‘overwhelming
success of Davis, who this past
weekend captured the Junior
Nationals 200-meter dash title at
Penn State in a Junior National
record time of 20.29.

' .But the success of this club runs‘ '

much deeper thanthe outstanding
times, The numerous trophies and
the deserved respect that exists at
any time a New Image competitor
steps to the line. '

Since its founding in 1973, the

club has provided youngsters with
.the opportunity to excel both as

athletes as well as responsible men
and women

The providers, for the most part,
have been four men——Elbert
Kennedy, Jr.; Elbert Kennedy Sr.;
Dorel Watley and Sterlino Smith—
who all symbolize unlimited
dedication. Whether it's the
Monday-Thursday practices, the
weekend trips to meets all across the
country ‘or the presentations to the
various companies and individuals
who have ﬁnancia“lly supported the

club,’ the foursome so ends -the.

endless hours making sure that
everyone is given the first class

treatment that he has become

accustomed to receiving.

It sounds like quite a bit, _but the
effort extended by the team
members is equally impressive.

“These kids know what -it takes to
become successful,” the ‘elder
Kennedy said. “They understand
that the discipline learned through
track should be carried over to the
other parts of their lives.”

Track Club Intent On
  Doing Just That .

‘Not only must they make the
effort Monday through Thursday to
attend practices and give I00
percent, but they must also maintain
adequate grades or they will be
disqualified from racing.

“They have to have a C average in
school," Smith explained. “I’m.the
report -card checker. What's special
about these kids is you don't have to
ask them for it, they just bring the
card to me. I remember, at one time,

we didn’t have a kid on the team with.

a low grade of a C.

“Only A's and B’s.”

With regard to how the team
obtains its members, there is ‘almost
_no recruiting involved.

“The kids come to us,” Smith said.
“No onegets thrown off ‘the team.
They find out within two weeks
whether they want to make the
sacriﬁces or not. I can’t remember
‘anyone who hasn’t made it with this

Headhunﬁng:
Should New
Rules Limit It?

By SCOTT DELl.ETl'

Monday night’s Pirate-St‘. ,_
Louis game may have revived an
old baseball .t“actic—'—the
intentional throwing of a ball at a

jbatter, commonly referred to as

thebeanball, .-

The culprits were pitchers
John Candelaria and Joaquin
Andujar. In the top of the thrid,
Andujar, ‘who has been
struggling with a 3-1 I record this
season, threw behind the head of
rookie centerfielder Marvell
Wynne," who singled off the
Cardinal ' pitcher to open the

ame.

At this point, home plate
umpire Joe West issued a
warning Andujar, along with
Candelaria and managers Chuck
Tanner and Whitey Herzog. The
next pitcher to throw near a
batter would be ejected from the
game, along with the pitcher's
manager.

Two batters later, Andujar
nearly hit third basemen Bill
Madlock. Under the rule,
Andujar should have been
thrown out, but West did
nothing.

As the Pirates took the field in
the middle of the third,
Candelaria and Madlock were
having a discussion between
pitcher's mound and third base,
most likely about the close brush
with Anduja~r’s fastball. Two
pitches into the bottom of the
third, Adujar was levelled to the
Busch Stadium dirt by a
Candelaria fastball behind his
head.

West pointed at the 6-7 Pirate
lefthander and threw his fist
down, giving Candelaria a quick

exit to the showers. Then both
benches cleared, with various

’ Cardinals and Pirates screaming

at the umpires and each otiher.

Could all of this halve been -

avoided? Andujar should have
been thrown out of the game for
throwing at Madlock, but at the.

"same time, Candelaria could

have restrained himself from
throwing at the St. Louis pitcher.

And West could have taken a '

calmer posture during th
ensuing argument. ‘

Perhaps a rule change is in I

order. If a pitcher throws at a

batter with the intent of hitting‘

him, the pitcher should be
ejected from the game
immediately. No warnings, no
second chances.

The current rule leaves too
much to the umpire‘s discretion.
What if a'ball slips out of the
opposing pitcher's hand? Or if he
loses control of a pitch? Perhaps
the umpire can tell which is
which, but this can benefit the
umpires.

Ironically, one may have
believed the Cardinals would
have been fired up by the
incident, but Candclaria‘s
replacement, Cecilio Guante,
"pitched seven shutout innings
enroute to his first career victory.

The beanball is a part of
baseball's past. Although the
pitch was not intended for him,
Cleveland shortstop _R~ay
Chapman was killed when a ball
struck him in the head during the
early l920s.

Granted, equipment has made
the game more safe, but the
prospect of a 90-mile-per-hour
fastball aimed at a batter's back
is still frightening. With a change
in the rulebook, hotheaded
pitchers like Andujar and
Candelaria may be inclined to
control themselves.

The satisfaction for both the
competitors as well as the coaches is
apparent.

been very

“We’re very proud of the kids that‘

come out of this program,” Elbert
Sr. said. We ask only one thing of
them after they leave us and that is to
come back and spend some time
with kids here now, showing them
what the experience of the club has
done for them.

“It, without a doubt, provides the
kids with someone to look up to.”

Among these successful New
Image offsprings is former Pitt star,
Dorel Watley, who now coaches the
women's New Image program.

In 1976, Watley, a former world
record holder in the 500-meter dash
as well as a member of the national

champion distance medley team."**

was a member of the U.S. team that
travelled to Russia.

Several members of this past
season’s Pitt track squad have been
some of the more notable achievers
on New Image, including NCAA
high hurdle champ Roger Kingdom;
intermediate hurdler and Big East
indoor 400-meter dash runner-up
Mario Joyner; All-America and
holder of the school’s indoor 800-
meter run record Terry Gallagher;
and All-America on the 3200-meter
relay team, Garland Brown.

The 1978 junior gir1’s team, by

setting two national records which
exist today, won the national title,‘

the first ever brought back to
Pittsburgh. The occasion was
momentous enough to have Mayor
Caliguiri award the team and the
entire club with the key to the city
during a ceremony downtown.

Also in 1978, the younger girls of
the team produced a world record in
the 880, (4x220) relay. Their time of
l:36.9 bettered the former record
held by an East German team whose
1975 record was l:37.8.

Today, with a membership of
some 25 youngsters, the team has a
full slate of national meets in which
it will be competing. Already this

season, at the Cleveland Classics .\
meet, the team came home with 28 ‘

trophies, including 20 first places.
Some of the more talented and
proven members of the team are
Renee Henderson, the Big East’s 55-
meter dash champ and the only four-
time 100- and 200-meter dash champ
in Pittsburgh’s City League while
representing Pcabody’s High-
landers. -

There's also been Darnell Turner,
state Class-AA champ in the 200-
and 400- meter dashes. In addition,
the most prolific high school
sprinter of all time, Clinton Davis.

Davis, in February, nailed the
400-meter dash at the illustrious
Wanamaker-Millrose Games in
front of a packed house at Madison
Square Garden. Davis defeated
several of the world’s top-ranked
400-meter men.

The respect of the New Image
Track Club has become worldwide,
though one would not get that
impression by the coverage provided
courtesy of the area media. Not only
have its successes been over-
shadowed, but aside from Davis,
there has been almost no credit given
the club.

The team sees a desperate need for
promotion of the sport in the area.
The time does not exist to put
together the type of promotional
program which would be successful.

Despite this solitary distraction,
the team is a superior example of
what the youth oftoday can become.
Thanks to the willingness of some
individuals who truly want to see
kids have the chance to grow and
a.<;his:vc in a.-u ni.q.u.e -wayt . _.

and 50 assists for 107 points for
the Skipjacks. His 57 goals broke
the existing record for most goals
in one season as well as the mark
for points and goals by a first-
year player.

Tebbutt—a’ late addition to
the Skipjacks——set a new record
for defensemen with 28 goals and
84 points. Tebbutt also received
another award, when it was
revealed that he has been signed
to a multi-year contract by the
Penguins and will attend their
camp in the fall.

Said General Manager Eddie
Johnston, “We are very proud of
the accomplishments of both

'Mitch and Greg and look for-
ward to their contributions in
training camp. Mitch is going to

have to work very hard to move
up the ladder, but every year that
he has played, he has been
among the league’s scoring
leaders. _

“The addition of Tebbutt gives
us some depth on the left side,
and he has proven he can score
with a good shot and is not afraid
of mixing it up when he has to
play tough.” 

“If every player had the heart
and courage that Mitch dis-
played,” Baltimore coach Lou

Angotti said, “it would be easy to
coach.”

Angotti said one game late in

the year stood out in his mind. »

. “Mitch couldn’t skate in the
morning and could hardly get a
skate on in the evening. I dressed
him in case he had to serve a
penalty or see limited action. The
next thing I knew, he scored all

three goals in a key win down the
stretch.”

Tebbutt, 26, was an eighth.-
round draft choice by Minnesota
in 1977, but saw only limited
action in both the old World‘
Hockey Association and in the
National Hockey League
(NHL). He spent two years with A
Erie Blades in the Eastern
Hockey League and one year
with Ft. Wayne in the Interna-
tional Hockey League before
going to Baltimore last year in a‘
tryout.
