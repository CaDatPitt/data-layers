Bus lane to reopen

PAT study shows Fzﬁh Avenue route faster, safer

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Contributing Editor

In spite of the opposition from
University of Pittsburgh President
Wesley Posvar, Port Authority
Transit will re-open the Fifth
Avenue bus lane in Oakland in
mid-July.

“At this point, it’s still too early
to set a specific date,” said Debra
DeCourcy, assistant manager of
media relations for PAT.

Posvar and County
Commissioner Pete Flaherty were
outspoken opponents of the bus
lane because of the danger it
presents to pedestrians.

In preparation for the re—
opening of the bus lane, PAT is
installing a steel railing from Craft
Street to South Bouquet Street to
encourage pedestrians to cross
only at designated crosswalks,
DeCourcy said.

Before service resumes, PAT
will also issue traffic alerts to
advise pedestrians and motorists
of the re—opening of the bus lane,

eight months for reconstruction.

University to set limit on student computer usage in the Fall  

By Dominic Romeo
For T be Pitt News

Beginning this fall, in order to
use any of the computers in the
university’s public computing
labs, Pitt students and faculty
members will need to obtain a
Computer Accounts Program
password and account number.

The CAP account will enable
the Computing and Information
Service to regulate the usage of
all the university’s computer
systems in the same way they
presently regulate mainframe
usage.

Previously, CAP accounts were
only needed to log on to the
mainframe system. However,

groups had questioned the overall
safety of [the bus lanel,” DeCourcy
said.

Reconstruction included
repaving the bus lane to make it
more clearly distinguishable from
the counter-traffic lanes on Fifth
Avenue.

PAT ’s decision to re-open the
bus lane was based on a study
conducted while the Fifth Avenue
buses were rerouted to Forbes
Avenue. The study examined the
impact of the bus lane on overall
safety, travel time, sidewalk
congestion, air quality and future
development throughout the
Forbes and Fifth Avenue corridor.

The results of this study
indicated that the bus lane
improved safety and reduced
travel time along Fifth and Forbes
Avenues.

The number of personal injuries
per year involving bus accidents
in Oakland was 48 percent higher
before the bus lane opened and
after it was closed, than while it
was in operation, according to
the results of the study.

The new account is required by
the Federal Office of Management
and Budget, which recently
required all universities to begin

In the past, if someone wanted
to use any of the university’s
more than 460 personal computers
to run any one of its 50 site-
licensed software packages, all
that was needed was a current
valid Pitt ID, and a diskette to
store information. Disks also had
to be exchanged to use different
applications.

However, the “direct- charging”

available to users, according Robin
Rueﬂe, an academic computing
specialist for Academic
Computing.

The CAP account will now be
used along with a private
password to “log on” to the
application server, which acts as
a community disk drive for the
personal computers, said Ruefle.

Once logged on to a file server,
the user will be able to use any of
the university’s software available
at the public labs. The user will
also able to set up a super-
computing account from any
terminal.

Also because the computer will
know who is at the terminal, the
user will have the ability to create
a file on the university’s remote
disk drives that only the user will

be able to alter, save on and
retrieve from. This can be used
as a backup to one’s own disks.

David Shatz, manager of
Academic Computing,
encourages students and staff to
go to the labs that will be open
for the remainder of the summer
session and set up a CAP account
now.

“Lines will be unavoidable in
the fall,” said Shatz. “Your best
bet is to set up an account now
at one of the summer labs.” I

The labs at David Lawrence
Hall, Forbes rQuadrangle and
Benedum Hall will be able to
directly set up CAP accounts for
students. CAP accounts for faculty
and staff will be set up by their
departmental administrator or
project leader.

All that is needed to set up an
account is a student or staff ID or
a pink registration slip and a
photo ID.

All students and staff will have
an allocated $200 of which $70
can be used towards hard-copy
printouts. This translates to about
1000 single—sided pages of output.
The remaining $130 will be
available to pay for remote- disks
space on the file servers.

The allocation is renewed at
the beginning of each term and
the level of spending is updated
by Academic Computing daily.

Users will be able to tell how —

much credit they have remaining
right from their personal
computers and will have to use
their allocations sparingly if they
are approaching their limit.

That cigarette you left burning

 hearing on fire-safe cigarettes.
 Fires caused by cigarettes kill
over 1,400 Americans each year

andpburn another 3,300 people.
‘I Walgren has asked the tobacco

industry to join with public—safety
officials and firefighters
nationwide to develop a fire—safe
cigarette. Although the tobacco
industry may claim otherwise,
Walgren said that no one can
 seriously dispute that cigarettes

“We know a ﬁre-safe cigarette

For The Pitt News

The parking problems that
plague Pitt commuters are only
going to be compounded come
the second ‘week of August.

That’s when the Public Parking
Authority will be closing the
Schenley Plaza parking lot
between the Carnegie and
Hillman Library for a complete
remodeling. _ E

The lot will be converted from
metered parking to an attendant
lot and increased by about 100
spaces. However, because of a
schedule delay, ‘it won’t reopen
completely until the end of 1990,
although 150 of the current 200'

spaces should be available by

mid—September. It had initially
been hoped that the lot would be
open by the start of fall—term
classes.

“We’re doing everything we

can do to move things up,” said ,

the authority’s deputy director,
Richard Zimmer. According to
Zimmer, the delay resulted from
the authority’s* having to work
out details with Pitt, the Carnegie
and several other area institutions.

Although the delay will pose
problems for the first couple of
weeks of the fall term, the
authority officials said the
improvements made should
benefit commuters. According to

ii/inter weight gains bring summer banger pains

By Jennifer Shusk
For The Pitt News a

Yes, summer has officially
arrived! Unfortunately, many
students are also noticing the
arrival of the extra pounds that
snuck up on them over the winter
months, as they unsuccessfully
try squeezing into last year’s
bikinis and tank tops.

Instead of buying bi gger clothes
to remedy the situation, most
students opt to diet those pounds
away.

“I saw pictures taken of myself
at Christmas, and I didn’t like the
way I looked. I was also sick of
the way my clothes fit,” said
an office
manager at Pace Long Distance
Company.

Schreiber started on her own
diet plan using the Slim Fast diet
as a supplement, which she drank
for breakfast. She ate the TCBY
lowfat “yogurt of the day” for
lunch and oatmeal for dinner.
She also began walking every
day and would try to do at least
40 miles a week.

should help, since up to 20
percent of them are not
functioning properly at any given
time. He added that the lot will
also be safer, since the lighting
will be improved and an attendant
will be present.

Bonci, a dietician and the
outpatient coordinator
nutrition services at Presbyterian
University Hospital, doesn’t agree
with this type of dieting.

“One may look good on the
outside, but diet affects what
goes on in the inside too," Bonci
said.

change.’ 0

“If the menstrual cycle stops, ~

one should seek the advice of a
physician,” said Bonci.

Using products that are made
to appease the appetite, such as
Dexatrim and Acutrim, does not
help to promote a behavioral
change, said Bonci. Instead, the
person will choose it as a
substitute without learning proper
eating habits that will stabilize
his or her ideal weight.

long run. Americans have the

Katsur can only rent parking-

spaces from his 5732 Dawson St.’
lot to local residents.

This has been a big problem
for Katsur lately, ever since the
City I instituted permit street
parking for Oakland residents.
He’s losing a lot of business,
mainly because a street sticker
only costs residents $10 a year,
compared‘ to $45 a month to park
in Katsur’s lot. 5

“If you were a community
member, would you pay $45 a
month when it costs just $10 a
year to park on the street?” he
asked. “Successful street permit
parking has eliminated all "my
customers." ’ )

Since January, Katsur has been
trying to change this community

status of his parking lot to public, ,

allowing anyone to park there.

Donald R. Mattison, M.D., has
been appointed the dean of the
Graduate School of Public Health,
announced University of
Pittsburgh President Wesley W.
Posvar and senior vice president
for health sciences, Thomas
Detre.

Mattison, who will be the sixth
dean of the GSPH, was selected
by a search committee headed
by George M. BernierJr., dean of
the University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine, and will
assume his position on Aug. 1.
The GSPH has not had a dean
since the resignation of Raymond
Seltser in 1987.

Mattison is currently a professor
of obstetrics and gynecology and
professor of toxicology at the
University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences. His concentration is in
pharmacology and toxicology,
and his research was focused on

developmental toxicology and
risk—assessment methodology.

He serves on the editorial board
of three professional journals and
is the author and co—author of
over 100 articles.

Prior to taking his position at
the University of Arkansas in 1984,
Mattison was chief of the
Pregnancy Research Branch of
Reproductive Toxicology, a
division of the National Institute
of Child Health and Human
Development.

Mattison received his master's
degree in chemistry from
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and his medical
degree from Columbia University.

“Dr. Mattison is a man of great
vision, and he has a strong sense
of the role of public health in
today's society,” said Bernier.
Detre added, “Dr. Mattison’s
credentials as a scientist and
teacher make him ideally suited
to head the Graduate School of
Public Health into the next
century.”

New GSPH Dean appointed

In a written statement, Mattison

claimed that the GSPH will be «

facing complex challenges and
that health-care professionals
must fight and better understand

old diseases while trying to fight’

new diseases. He said,
“Increasing economic constraints

makes it essential to understand I

how health-care and research
dollars are spent and the
alternative to existing spending
patterns."

“I look forward to working
with the faculty, students and
staff of the Graduate School of
Public Health and the University
of Pittsburgh tosustain excellence
of existing programs and develop
initiatives in emerging areas of
public health,” added Mattison.
“Finally, with my wife Margaret
and our children, Jon and Amy, I
look forward to the opportunity
to join the community of scholars
at the University of Pittsburgh
and live in the delightful city of
Pittsburgh among its friendly
citizens.”

lot.

When Katsur originally ﬁled
for his license competition from
the city's permit’-parking program,
attracting business was not a
problem. The street permit-
parking program was non-
existent. Therefore, residents
often had a hard time ﬁnding a
space on the. streets because
commuters, members of the
Oakland work force and others
would park on neighborhood
streets. Left without alternatives,
members of the community then
paid Katsur for a space in his lot.

However, once the permit—
parking program began, Katsur
lost business. Although it seems
as if it would be relatively easy to
change a parking lot from

I community to public, Katsur and

his attorneys have been in court
since January.

“Why is it that the institutions
can build, but when an individual
tries to change a community lot
to a public lot, he runs into so
many problems?” Katsur asked.

His main opposition is from a
neighbor who believes that public
parking will increase traffic
hazards and noise. But despite
one opposing force, Katsur has
documented support from other
neighbors. “I do have support
from the majority of the
community,” he said." 9

Because he is restricted to
community members only in the
lot at 3732 Dawson St., Katsur’s
clientele is very restricted.

“I don’t want to be limited on

my customers. There's a big
market for students who don’t
live in this area," he said.

“When I approached [students],
I asked them one question: ‘Is
there a need for more parking for
students in Oakland?’ A positive
reply was emphasized
repetitively,” said Katsur.

“People want to park as close
as they can to where they’re
going; may it be home, school or
work,” he said. ‘

Katsur has a positive outlook
about the increase in clientele if
he is granted the change from a
community to a public parking
lot in July. .

“The demand for parking is so
great, I figure that when the public
knows they can come to this area
and park, they’ll come,” he said.

New freedom in Eastern Europe spurs uprise in anti-Semitism

By Kristene M.A. Bondi
For Tbe Pitt News

As communism continues to
fall, citizens of Eastern Europe
are enjoying new-found
freedoms, including the freedom
of speech.

However, according to Rabbi I

Joseph Levine of Hillel, some
Europeans are taking this freedom
too far, with several anti-Sernitic
groups turning what was once
secret hatred into open violence.

Rabbi Levine, who recently
returned from the European
World Student Christian
Federation Confedéhce in Eastern
Europe, said the current “situation
with anti-Sernitism in Eastern
Europe is chaotic.” There is
“sporadic violence [and] upsurges
that are unpredictable from
unexpected places. ” One of these
is Poland.

Poland was the site of
Auschwitz, an infamous Nazi
concentration camp. At the
Nuremburg trials, Rudolf Hoess,
a director of the camp for more
than 3 years, testified that 2 1/2
million people were executed
and another 500,000 were starved
to death there. I

A. G. Miller, an expert on
genocide, said that research
shows that “six million Jewish
men, women and children were
exterminated by the Nazis.”

Rabbi Levine explained,
“Europe has not accepted the
Holocaust yet." This is one reason

for the great amount of anti-»

Semitism in Eastern Europe. With
the opening of communications
to Eastern Europe, different myths
about the Holocaust are
beginning to trickle out. One of
these is that the estimated 9 million
people who died in various

concentration camps died of a ,)
fatal disease instead of by Nazi

extermination.

According to Rabbi Levine, a
big portion of the current problem
is the background. “All of the
modiﬁcations of church teachings
that have taken place in this
country in the last 70 years in
terms of removing the charge of
deicide [the killing of God] and
updating all of the teachings of
Christianity about Judaism have
bypassed Eastern Europe under
communism.

“Their teaching of Christianity
is like ancient teaching of
Christianity. The folk hatred is
now free to emerge.” F

In Warsaw, the Jewish State
Theater has its walls defaced with
“Jews to the ovens. Jews for
soap.” Such obscene slogans as
these are commonplace in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union.
Hate mail and threats have
become everyday occurrences.

Newsweek E reported in early
May that “skinheads outnumber

[practicing Jews] by at least 10 to
1.” The skinheads are only one
of many anti—Semitic
organizations in the former
Eastern Bloc. —

In the Soviet Union, which has
an estimated 1.5 million Jews,
the Pamyat terrorizes Jews. The
Pamyat blames the Jews for the
death of Czar Nicolas and the rise

of communism in Russia. On the V

father hand, it also says that
“greedy Jewish capitalists” are
destroying the communist
government. ,However, the
Pamyat opposes Jewish
emigration. It believes that “Jews
should be kept and tried for their
crimes.”

Rabbi Levine believes that the
Pamyat is gaining power because
“the government «is now
weakened because of the conﬂict
between Gorbachev and Boris

Yeltsin,” who is Gorbachev’s rival .

for political power. ’

Currently “Project Exodus,” a
national project, is working to
help Soviet emigrants. It is in the
process of raising a total of $420
million. This amount is divided
into $151.1 million for
transportation, $58.8 for
absorption centers in Israel,
where Soviet Jews will learn
customs and Hebrew, both of
which they need to survive, and
$210 million for housing and
food for the new emigrants.

. Though “Project Exodus” is on

Media attention gives us Poz

President Posvar has received a lot of attention in the
media lately for the “action” he has taken on the ROTC

Posvar’s “action” has consisted -of signing a letter

, proposed by the president of the University of Wisconsin-
.Madison from members of the American Association of

Universities to the Secretary of Defense, which criticized
the Defense Department’s policy of barring gays and
lesbians from the military.

The letter was Posvar’s sole offensive against an issue

‘that concerns a large portion of the students at Pitt. »While
other university presidents have explored the problem of

ROTC, Posvar has refused to effect a change.

Posvar has repeatedly rationalized his lack of action by
saying that “ROTC discrimination is a national problem
and should be dealt with on a national. level.”

This is the same Posvar whose administration adopted
an anti.-dis.Ct,i’mination clause protecting gays and lesbians

in 1988. Déspite this policy,’ though, ROTC exists on

campus and takes up an entire floor in the Cathedral. In
addition, ROTC credits can count toward graduation. In I

 A Posvar’s words the contradiction can exist on the Pitt

campus .because'ROTC is ,“an outside organization.”
This tokenistic attempt at settling campus grumblings is
typical of Posvar, circa 1980s —- a brief, reactive half-
hearted response to a. pressing student concern.
In fact, at the May University Senate Council meeting,

i Professor Mike Margolis asked Posvar why Pitt doesn't

send its own letter as -well, further emphasizing the
concerns of a major university. Posvar hasn’t spear-
headed, this campaign, though. Could it be that the
distinction this ‘retired Air Force colonel has made be-
tween the military and civilian civil rights only extends
when there is enough padding or when someone louder
is leading the charge? ‘
Perhaps the media of this city needs to actually inves-
tigate the Posvar of this decade, as opposed to reading

the press releases that end with Posvar’s signature.

On a beautiful Saturday morn-
ing two or three weeks ago, I got
up bright and early and went
Downtown with one of my
friends. Our first stop was going
to be Women’s Health Services,
where she had an appointment
for a routine exam, then we were
going shopping and out to eat
breakfast. We were both look-
ing forward to a fun, relaxing day
in the city. ‘

As we approached the block
of the clinic, we began to hear
protesters chanting and clapping.
Hundreds ofthem filled the street.
Fortunately, the police had set
up barricades so that people
could still enter the Fulton Build-
ing, which houses WHS. The
activists, singing and kneeling in
prayer, seemed harmless enough.
We made the mistake of thinking
that anyone with such a strong
sense of faith would act compas-
sionately toward clinic patrons.

As we made our way down the
street, dozens of pamphlets were
thrust into my hands —- ranging

- from pictures of mauled fetuses

and death statistics to Bible pas-

sages and ads for area adoption ‘

agencies. I even received my
first “ticket to Hell” that morning.
That’s right -— I was damned to
hell, and they were kind enough

to let me know. Several women
about my age stood in my path,
lecturing me on the doom I would
face if I set foot in the clinic. One
preaching woman got so close to
me that it would be a gross»
understatement to say that she
invaded my personal space. I
have never been that close to

Amy
DiMarco

someone without kissing them. I
never felt so uncomfortable in
my life. ,

I undoubtedly support the right
of Americans to demonstrate
freely in support of their beliefs.
However, this fright to expres-
sion does not entail harassing
innocent passers-by. They
wrongly assumed that either my
friend or I was getting an abor-
tion, simply because we are
female, and we were heading in
the general direction of an abor-
tion clinic. For all they knew, we
could have been on our way to
get haircuts in the salon which
happens to be in the same bulid-
mg.

Protesters can go too far  

The situation I encountered that
morning did not present a moral
issue for me at all. It would be a
different story had I been on my
way to get an abortion. But I
would be just as annoyed if those

protesters had been demonstrat- Ty

ing for any cause. Even if that
woman was screaming that she
thought I was wonderful, any-
body hollering anything in my
face is bound to upset me. People
can change things they disagree
with by protesting. But if they
are inconsiderate about the rights
of other people, they risk not
being taken seriously.

Fortunately that morning, my
friendandl were assisted through
part of the crowd by nine ,.or 10
women wearing yellow T -shirts
that said “Pro—Choice Escort.”
Some of these women I recog-
nized as Pitt students. They did
not hand out literature, nor did
they yell, chant or impose them-
selves on anyone. They were just
there to help people get where
they were going without being
harassed. I'd like to’ thank these
great women for volunteering
their time and energy in a con-
structive way.

Amy DiMarco is the copy editor _

forTbe Pitt News.

While Donald Shufran’s Uune
20] response to Mark Smith's
Uune_13l article was thoughtful,
he overlooked some important

R issues that need to be addressed.

Pat Robertson and Jerry Fal-
well may not be truly represen-
tative of those who oppose
abortion, but as the major pub-
licizers and fundraisers for the
anti-choice lobby, they deserve
serious attention. Their relig-
ious position enables them to

manipulate people's religious
feelings and emotions for their
own political ends.

The abortion issue is not solely
concerned with the question of
where life begins. ,_ Rather, it in-
volves the value placed on a
woman’s ability to determine her
future. If a woman cannot con-
trol her fertility, it will be ex-
tremely difficult for her to main-
tain a job, let alone develop a
career and be economically self-

.sufficient. Many in the anti-
choice movement are opposed

I to birth control as well, which

Letter

further restricts a woman’s abil-
ity to control her body.

In reality, an extremely small
number of women have .more

than one abortion. Because no
birth control is 100 percent ef-
fective, many women become
pregnant when they are not
psychologically and economi-
cally capable of maintaining a
child. By focusing specifically
on the potential life of a child,
the existing life of the woman
is disregarded.

Viewing the abortion debate
as a conception issue only is

Oh, my aching back! Strange Wins at St. Clair C.C.

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

It was almost a good thing that
Curtis Strange was not in perfect
health yesterday; otherwise, he
might have made the golf course
at St. Clair Country Club look like
a day at the local Putt—Putt.

Strange birdied four holes,
including sinking a 7—foot putt on
the 18th hole to finish in grand
style, en route to a final round 69
and a 10 under overall mark to
win the seventh annual
Westinghouse-Family House
Invitational.

Strange was plagued by back
problems throughout the two-
day event and was wearing a
special inﬂatable back brace on
loan from Payne Stewart to ease
the soreness.

“He’s been taking some Advil
which is an anti—inﬂammatory,
and .1 gave him some Motrin,
which is the same thing in a
stronger dose,” said Dr. Richard
Collins.

Collins, an orthopedic surgeon,
served as Strange’s local doctor
during his stay in Pittsburgh. The
cause of Strange’s pain is currently
not known due to the lack of x-

rays.

“He’s got a sore back with
some muscle spasms with no
sign of anything serious. But we
need x—rays to be sure, and I

suggested that he gets those when.

he goes back to Virginia,” Collins
said.

Well, at least paying the medical
bill won't be a problem. Strange
received $125,000 for his first-
place finish in a tournament with
a total payoff of $674,000.

Strange broke club pro Phil
Newcamp’s couse record of 66
on Monday with a round of 65 to
set up his virtual coast to victory
yesterday. Strange had at least a
two—to—t-hree shot cushion
throughout the day. However,
there was an anxious moment.

On the par-5 14th hole, a short
little number by professional
standards at 466 yards, Strange
hit his tee shot to the right and
landed in the rough. Trouble
loomed in the form of a small oak
tree which was about 30 yards
directly in front of Strange. Most
of the crowd thought Strange
would start the ball out to the left
and bring it back to the reachable
green in the form of a slice.

Turns out the gallery had a bad
angle. Strange went right through
the tree and wound up short.
After a «fair pitching wedge, his
ball came to rest near a cart path
in the heavy rough surrounding
the green, about 25 feet from the
hole. After taking countless
practice swings to pop the ball
out of its thick lie, Strange topped
the ball and sent it over to the
rough on the other side of the

Julius Dawkins (80) is attempting to reenter the NFL, via
Arenaball with the Pittsburgh Gladiators this season.

Former Panthers fulfill pro dreams in Arenaball

By Scott Campbell

= ' ._ Assistant Sports Editor

It can be on a blacktop driveway of a split-level ranch in the suburbs, or in an open grassy ﬁeld’ V

behind a farm in the countryside, or between parked cars on a side street in a big city.

Wherever the scene, millions of youngsters have dreamed of one day slam—dunking over Michael b
Jordan, or belting one of Dwight Gooden’s fastballs outta here, or throwing the winning touchdown I

pass in the Superbowl -- in short, of being a professional athlete.  »
And for those who come close to realizing that dream, thecompetitive spirit is often hard to kill.

Such is the case forjulius Dawkins and Billy Osborn, two former Pitt wide receivers who are currently a .

members of the Arena Football I.eague’s Pittsburgh Gladiators. ~

Dawkins, who also played with the Gladiators in 1988, spent two years (198384) with -the NFL’s  
Buffalo Bills, catching 32 passes for 418 yards. while pulling in three touchdowns during thattime.

Osborn, who also played basketball and baseball at Pitt, recently signed with the Glads after
spending 1989 on the Philadelphia Eagles’ injured reserve list.

Both players agree that Arenaball isvnot quite the game they’re used to, but it is a wayto cash in ,

on a childhood fantasy. ,

“Pm still getting adjusted to the [Arena] game,” said Osborn. “It's different; that’s for sure.”

Different indeed. Arena football calls forits offensive players to turn around and play defense also,
a role into which Osborn could easily adjust as he played defensive back at Pitt in his freshman year.

Dawkins, on the other hand, doesn’t have to worry about defense. Gladiators Coach Joe Haering
uses Dawkins only on offense, allowing him to stay fresh against opponents. It's paid off for Haering.
Three times last Friday night, Dawkins sped by defenders for receptions of 26 yards or longer in a 55-
32 thrashing of the Washington Commandos. He caught six passes in all for 137 yards.

‘.‘There’s no question; Julius is our big-play guy,” said Haering. e

But there is also little question why Dawkins and Osborn are playing for the Gladiators. ,

“I’d love to make it back to the NFL,” said Osborn. “I think that this could be an avenue back to there.
You have to keep active, keep competitive if you want to play in the NFL; you can’t just sit around.”

“I think I can still play in the NFL,” Dawkins said. “I think I could make a good third wide receiver,
or a good third down receiver. I have no injuries, and I could contribute to any team if they were
looking for someone who knows the receiver position.” ' ,

“I'd rather look back five years from now and say I did it,” said Osborn, “rather than having nothing
to look back on.” _ A A

Osborn said that this will likely be his only year in Arenaball, however. .

“I think I’m going to try that new World Football League in Europe [that the NFL is putting together].
But if that doesn’t work out, I'm going to move on to something else.”

“Something else” meaning hanging up the spikes for good. T

“It’s a tough decision for an athlete to make. You always think, ‘It’d just be fun to play a little more,”’
Osborn said.

World Cup shaping up going into quarterﬁnals

By Sean Hellman
sum’ Writer

A number of major upsets and
some close early-round matchups
have made this year’s World Cup
one of the most exciting ever.

This past Sunday was billed
“Super Sunday" by the media in
Italy for a pair of second—round
matches which could easily have
been ﬁnal game contests: Brazil
vs. Argentina and West Germany
vs. Holland.

The ﬂamboyant Brazilian side
met up with a battered Argentine
squad Sunday afternoon.

Argentina was shaken by the
opening-day loss to Cameroon
and star player Diego Maradona’s
foot injuries. Brazil dominated
the game, hitting the goalpost
four different times. But in the
81st minute, Maradona was able
to take the ball in the midﬁeld,
avoid Brazilian tacklers while
sprinting toward the goal, and
slip the ball to Claudio Caniggia,
who sent the ball to the back of
the net, breaking the heart of
Brazil.

“Brazil played beautiful soccer,”
said Pitt head soccer coach Joe
Luxbacher. “They did everything

but score. It’s a shame they are
eliminated. They play great
soccer. They can score from
anywhere. But Maradona caught
fire. He can carry a team.”

West Germany vs. Holland was
a rematch of the 1974 ﬁnal, which
Germany won. Germany has been
in the last two Cup ﬁnals and
looked impressive in its three
first-round matches, outscoring
opponents 10-3.

Holland won the European Cup
in 1989 and was expected to
challenge for the world
championship this year. But one
of these teams would be sent
home in only the second round.

It was the most exciting match
of the tournament thus far.
Defender Frank Rijkaard for
Holland and high scorer Rudi
Voeller for Germany were both
ejected in the 22nd minute for a
pair of altercations with each
other within two minutes. Both
teams had to play with one less
man, which created a wide-open
game.

“It is more exciting because
there is more space. It opens up
the game,” said Luxbacher.

~ The Germans scored twice on
goals by Juergen Klinsmann and
Andreas Brehme in the second
half to win 2-1. The Dutch added
a penalty kick goal in the 88th
minute. V

“Germany looked great, but so
did the Dutch. Both teams played
well. It’s a shame they had to
meet in the second round,"
Luxbacher added.

Germany will go on to play a
surprising Czech squad in the
quarterﬁnals. Tomas Skuhravy
leads all scorers with ﬁve goals.

round game against Costa Rica,
where the Czechs advanced with
a 4-1 win.

“They are big and strong and
physical," Luxbacher said.
“Skuhravy had three goals with
his head. He is deadly in the air.

“They are a good team, but it
would deﬁnitely be an upset if
they beat Germany. But when
you have a guy like [Skuhravyl,
you can always be in the game.

“If I had to pick a team [for the
title] it would be West Germany.
They are solid in the back, very
disciplined and they have guys
that can ﬂy up front. I would also

_ say Italy and Argentina have a

chance," Luxbacher said.

Cameroon’s “indomitable
Lions,” as they call themselves,
have been the surprise of the
tournament. They became the
first African team to qualify for
the quarterﬁnals with their 2-1
overtime win against Colombia
on Saturday. Thirty—eight-year—old
Roger Milla scored both goals in
overtime to raise his Cup total to
four without even starting a game.
He has scored all but one of
Cameroon’s goals in the Cup.

“Milla is very experienced. He's
given them a spark. His goals are
just being in the right place at the
right time," Luxbacher said.

Cameroon must play England-
Belgium in the quarterﬁnals. But
its players are already talking. of
advancing to the ﬁnal. Luxbacher
thinks not.

The United States’ quick
departure from the ﬁnals has
caused the soccer world  to
wonder how the Americans can
become a respectable squad by
the time they host the World Cup
in 1994. West German coach Franz
Beckenbauer has said he is
leaving the national team after
the World Cup. Rumors have
already begun about him
becoming the next American head
coach. Beckenbauer was captain

of the West German World Cup
champs in 1974 and coached
Germany to the ﬁnals in 1986.
But a coaching change would
not raise the skill level of American
players.

“’Ihat’s not our problem,” said
Luxbacher. “You can’t tell the
players how to play. I have
watched these games and there
is a big gap in skill level [between
U.S. players and the rest of the
world]. The difference is the speed
of play. You see how quickly
they move the ball.”

An ongoing debate in the NCAA
is whether to implement the
international rule of allowing only
two substitutions in a game.
Proponents of the rule say it
would improve the skill level of
our top college players;
opponents say it would hurt the
overall skill level of American
players.

Luxbacher feels NCAA rule
changes will not increase the
level of play in America. The
United States is a power in youth
soccer. Americans are successful
in under—19 (years old) and under-
16 world tournaments.

“It’s after that when [the rest of
the world's players] go into league
play and lU.S. players] go into
college and semi-pro leagues,"
Luxbacher said.

Club and national teams in
Europe and South America
constantly play outside their
country's borders, naturally

. gaining international experience.
. The »U.S. national team played
. virtually anyonel it could“ get on 5‘

the ﬁeld in preparation for the

World Cup —— kind of like George ]
Foreman or Mike Tyson ﬁghting 

anystiff they could lay theirleather
on to tune up for each other.

European experience for top
U.S. players would be themost
probable solution to increasing
the American quality of play on
the international level.

Lookfor smgorises and tmde—ups

By Michael Milliron
For Tbe Pitt News

The NBA will conduct its annual
selection meeting tonight in New
York at 7: 30 p.m. (TNT network).
While teams and general
managers alike have been
assessing the talent coming from
the collegiate ranks this year,
they have also been reviewing
their own personnel and trade
options. Before the draft, teams
must look at free agents they
might sign, what players they
might lose to free agency and
how their draft choices can best
be used.

While this year’s draft is said to
be deep in quality, it does not
boast many immediate impact
players. Derrick Coleman
(forward, Syracuse), Lionel
Simmons (F, LaSa1le), Gary Payton
(Guard, Oregon State), Dennis
Scott (G, Georgia Tech), Bo
Kimble (G, Loyola Marymount),
Chris Jackson (G, LSU), Kendall
Gill (G, Illinois) and Dwayne
Schintzius (center, Florida) are

considered the cream of this year’s
crop. It is important, however, to
keep in mind that none of last
year’s top six choices even made
the NBA All—Rookie Team. Even
the “can’t-miss” players
sometimes fail to distinguish
themselves in their rookie
campaign. Those picked by the
team for the draft greatly affect
long-term success although trades
that involve veterans often have
a bigger impact on a team’s
upcoming season.

The Denver Nuggets have been
very active in the past week, not
only in attempting to ﬁnd a general
manager, but in making several
personnel moves to overhaul the
club. The Nuggets sent all-star
guard Laffayate “Fat” Lever to the
Dallas Mavericks for the ninth
overall pick in this year’s draft
and a first round pick in the ’91
draft. Lever led the team in
scoring (18.3 ppg), rebounding
(9. 3), assists (5.5) and steals (2.12)
last year. By trading their best
player for draft picks, this certainly
means that the Nuggets are wiping

the slate clean and starting over.

The Nuggets then proceeded
to move up in the draft by trading
this year’s ninth and 15th picks to
the Miami Heat for the third overall
pick in the draft. The Nuggets are
said to be very interested in Gary
Payton. Other people reportedly
leaving Denver via free agency
are center Joe Barry Carroll and
forward Alex English. And Coach
Doug Moe may leave to become
a game analyst at NBC.

There is plenty of trade talk
going around and enough gossip
to fill an issue of the National
Enquirer going into tonight’s draft.
Let's take a look at some of the
rumors and trade speculations.

The Boston Celtics may make
a move with all-star forward Kevin
McHale. Look for the Celtics to
send McHale and the 19th pick
they own in this draft to the
Minnesota Timberwolves for the
sixth pick in the draft. McHale
would return home where he
starred at the University of
Minnesota, to give the Wolves
some strong inside scoring, which

in tonigbtls NBA draft

was something they lacked last
season. With the sixth pick in
their possession, the Celtics could
obtain a shooting guard to
improve a thin backcourt.

The Sacramento Kings are
said to be shopping with guard
Danny Ainge and forward Rodney
McCray. Who knows what
Sacramento is up to this time, but
the Seattle Supersonics are
reportedly interested in Ainge.
The former Celtic would be
reunited with his former coach
K.C. Jones, who is taking the
reins from Bernie Bickerstaff in
Seattle. The New York Knicks are
interested in McCray, and the
Kings have inquired about Mark
Jackson and Trent Tucker.

The Seattle Supersonics are
listening to offers for guard Dale
Ellis and forward Xavier
McDaniel. McDaniel would be
tough to part with, but the Sonics
have become disenchanted with
Ellis’ attitude and off-court
problems. 1989 first~round pick
Dana Barros cannot develop
while sitting on the bench. If

Danny Ainge is acquired, Ellis is
all but gone.

One wild rumor has Akeem
Olajuwon going to the Lakers for
James Worthy, Byron Scott,
Mychal Thompson and a No. 1
draft pick. However, Houston
Rockets owner Charlie Thomas
has said, “Akeem and I are very
close friends, and the value I
would put on the guy is something
I don't think anybody could
meet" Don't hold your breath

waiting for that trade to happen. ‘ ,

The Atlanta Hawks are seeing
who might bid the highest for the
“Human Highlight Film, ”
Dominique Wilkins. They are

also said to be trading center v

Moses Malone to the Milwaukee
Bucks for swingrnan Ricky Pierce.
Other names mentioned in draft-
day trade talk are forward Charles
Oakley of the New York Knicks
and forward Horace Grant of the
Chicago Bulls. So, just sit back
and watch tonight’s draft, for there
is sure to be a surprise or two.

green. The crowd was concerned,
as everyone thought Strange’s
back problems were taking their
toll as fatigue set in during the
final stretch.

But Strange coolly saved bogey
on the hole with a great recovery
shot followed by a short putt. It
Could have been much worse.

A “I played good from the start,
but I got very sloppy on the back
side for whatever reason, and
that’s irritating. Butl hung on and
won, and that’s nice,” Strange
said.

“It’s nice to come here and beat
a good field. The pins were quite
tricky today, and you have to be
a little careful. If you put [the ball]
above the hole, you have a
difficult twO—putt sometimes. So
that’s where the course changes
from day to day; it’s just pin
placement,” he added.

Most of the golfers coming off
the course commented on the
radical pin placement. And just
by. looking at the greens, you
knew this was a professional
tournament.

O The flags were placed on
sections of the greens which were
the hardest to reach. When
looking at the average green at
St. Clair, all one saw was a massive
expanse of perfectly mown grass,

* and a flagstick stuck somewhere

"in the cornerlor just above a sand
trap. In short, an average golfer’s
nightmare and a pro golfer’s major
pet peeve.

“This is a good golf course to
test yourself on. The course

played a lot tougher today; the
pins were all on slants and slopes,
and you could be out there all
day if you weren’t careful,” said
John Cook.

“You've got major winners [at
this tournament], and all the best
players that the [PGAl has. You
don’t come here to fool around;
you’ve got to play some good
golf to score well,” he added.

The rolling hills, deep valleys
and natural hazards, in addition
to the challenging pin placement,
left the field with a good margin
for error. Strange, however,
proved once again that he is one
of the toughest mental players in
the game by maintaining his lead
throughout the entire second
round.

“You look back through the
records, and Curtis Strange doesn’t
make mental mistakes. And that’s
the type of player he is; he’s
down the middle, and he doesn’t
get rattled,” said U.S. Open
runner—up Mike Donald.

. Strange is looking forward to
returning home in order to
prepare for the upcoming British
Open. He mentioned that the
back brace that Stewart lent him
helps keep the back warm and
ﬂexible during the day’s outing.
He might need it —— badly —- in’

Scotland to deal with the chilly‘

temperatures. A

Scott Hoch said his first task in
preparing for the yearly outing at
St. Andrews was to pack a lot of
sweaters. Maybe Strange will need
a warmer back brace.

Shakespeare Festival doubles-up for Richard II

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Contributing Editor

Director W. Stephen Coleman
took an unusual approach to the
casting of Richard II for the Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival.

Coleman had actors Jim Abele
and Robertson Dean alternate
the roles of Richard II and
Bolingbroke each night of the
performance.

The casting and set suggest
that Coleman is attempting to
illustrate the dichotomy of the
personality of power. Coleman’s
set uses two predominant colors,
red and black, to mark the gradual
usurping of power from King
Richard’s hands to those of his
cousin Bolingbroke.

Does his gamble pay off?

Yes, in a very big way.

Abele is brilliant as Richard 11.
His performance is the
Shakespeare Festival’s most
impressive feat of the season —
so far. Of course, there’s always
As You Like It and the possibility
that they’re saving the best for
last. But Abe1e’s act will be very
tough to follow.

, The play opens after the murder
of King Richard’s uncle, when

Henry Bolingbroke publicly
accuses Thomas Mowbray Uames
Berry] of committing the murder.

When the date arrives for their
trial by combat, King Richard
chooses to banish them from the
kingdom instead.

Bolingbroke’s father becomes
seriously ill at the news of his
son’s banishment, and Richard
takes his wealth the minute’ he’s
dead. King Richard needs the
money to raise an army to quell
the unrest in Ireland. Richard
goes off to battle, leaving his
uncle, the Duke of York (Derek
E. Campbell), to mind the
kingdom.

jWhile Richard is in Ireland,
Bolingbroke returns with an army
of his own. His true plot is to
overthrow the king and claim the
throne for himself, which proves
to be more difficult than he had
imagined.

Abele and Dean interact
beautifully, powerfully displaying
the fear and resentment of their
characters. The show has
two openings —— Abele was
Richard last night, and Deanwill
play the lead role tonight.

Unfortunately, I didn’t get to

Shocking Henry’ plays Fulton

By Dmitri Ragano

Entertainment Editor

” Be forewarned: If Henry Portrait of a Serial
Killer doesn’t shake you up, no film will.
The movie begins with scenes of bodies. We
hear the dead victims’ screams and see the
corpses —— shot, strangled, sliced up and bloody

— with vivid objectivity.

Henry (Michael Rooker), a polite, quiet drifter,
spends most of his free time killing. Henry
knows killing the way an old stoner knows pot.
At one point, he gives his roommate Otis (Tom
Towles) some tips: “You shoot one, strangle
another, then cut one up.  This way the police

can’t track you.”

Henry’s mother was a prostitute; as a child, he
was forced to wear a dress and watch his mother
sleep with tricks. Having served a prison sentence
for killing his mother and a lover, Henry now
lives in Chicago with Otis, a friend from prison,
and Otis’ newly divorced sister Becky (Tracy
Arnold) from the boondocks. Becky is
immediately attracted to Henry. Unlike her
slimy, pot-bellied brother, Henry is a real
gentleman.

After Otis discovers his roommate’s secret
passion, the two of them go on a killing spree.
They steal a videocamera and videotape

Jim Abele and Robertson Dean star in 'l'RSF's Richard II

Bowie’s

  Souncl+Visio11

By Joel Timulak

The Pitt News

About a year ago just about
everyone who was anyone back
in those classic-tracks days was
back in the spotlight with a
Michelob and a new tour deal.
You know, the Who, the Stones,
all that. Hell, even Iron Butterﬂy
made the rounds. This led me to
try to discover what all these
oldsters were really about. This
was about the time I stumbled
upon The Bowie Case.

Back then, like today, the
unusual guys—T-Rex, NewYork
Dolls, Roxy Music 4- were very
much in the background of the
megabuck rock world. So how
did it happen that a skinny,
androgynous Martian got so rich
and popular. Was it that he was
very talented? Bowie was
immensely talented, but I don't
need to tell you that there is no
equation that matches success
with talent.

Bowie was a complete fake.
He was crass, manipulative, ultra-
pretentious, and totally artificial.
He didn’t mess around with that
sincere, honest poet nonsense.
He just entered the limelight and
got the job done. He gave the
people what they wanted:~a star
and a hero. It was a pretty shrewd
trick that by merely acting like a
star, Bowie became one.

When the whole “Superstar”
routine, the whole “Fame” trip
became too immense for such a
thin pair of shoulders, Bowie

Tour

retreated to a more experimental
pose. This was about the time
when Bowie’s joke was
discovered. It became apparent
that Bowie was a great designer.
He assembled great bands,
created a new image and
proceeded to set another trend.

Bowie_’s records were
completely inauthentic examples
of whatever idiom he was
exploring, but they showed a
completely new mind in pop
culture. A mind that would either
explore more obscure musics for
exploration’s sake, or synthesize
them with pop culture. This mind
was not only plastic and media-
soaked but also smart and multi-
cultural. And it remains very
prevalent today.

But Bowie was very much a
phenomenon of the seventies.
When the eighties arrived, it
seemed that all of his strangness
and adventure was gone. He no
longer challenged pop culture,
he was challenged by the market
to get a hit.~Somehow at the end
of a very lame decade, Bowie
stormed back to form. He, for
better or worse, dropped the
theater and joined a rock band.

The Tin Machine had all the
talent of his other bands and
phases, but with about none of
hype. The group was eclectic,
scaled down and hi gh-quality and
Bowie seems to be continuing
these values in his other projects.
His choice of the quality-obsessed
independent label Rykodisc to

They’ve restored, re~mastered and
appended the first four LPs so far,
as well as a handsome 3 1/2 CD

This brings us to the matter at
hand, the Bowie Sound + Vision

celebration Of a phenomenal

,.career and a handsome set Of re-

issues, it is a farewell to the
seventies classics. Reviews have
been very good for his minimal
stage set and four piece group

Richard

featuring Adrian Belew as guitarist
and bandleader. The show also
features a specially designed ﬁlm
show.

Being a great actor, I’m sure
Bowie’s performance will meet
everyOne’s expectations, but I
have a feeling that tonight at the
Star Lake A phitheatre, Bowie will
be doing a very professional job
Of going through the motions to
please fans of his classic songs.
But for my money, no one e1se’s
motions are as worthy of
excitement.

A jong day's journey into love and sex Henry

Erica Jong
Any Woman's Blues

Do you love the man or do you
love his penis? Are you obessed
with his aura, his mystique or are
you just used to him being around?
Do you secretly harbor sado-
masochistic fantasies that include
anal rituals involving black
candles? Then Erica _Iong’s new
book is just the thing to satiate
your desire.

Where her best selling novel
Fear of Flying left off, Jong’s Any
Woman’: Blues takes up. Her
infamous character Isadora Wing
has now become the equally
nymphomanical Leila Sand in tale
of sexual obsession and addiction.

Jong’s prose is not for the weak
hearted. It takes the female's

 

perspective in a turbulant and
torrid love affair and Jong leaves
no guess work for the reader.

The way Jong uses sex in this
novel is brutal to the point of
excessivenes. She uses every
sexual cliche and forces the reader
to make a decision; either admit
that you have a sexual nature that
doesn't ﬁt the 1950's television
stereotype or continue to let
everyone else define your intimate
life for you.

The way Jong de-sensitizes the
very act of sexual intercourse
itself seems to correlate with her
lead character Leila’s problem of
obsession with her lover Dart.

Jong uses words like “cock”
and “fuck” so much that after the
reader's initial shock to her
language the words’ offensiveness

 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
   
 

  ”AN EXCEPIIONALLY
RICH ROMANTIC QQMEQY 

As risky and full of wit as anything the writer-

almost seem non—existant. As the
protagonist becomes numb to
her relationship, so the reader
becomes numb the “foul”
language that shapes our society’s
norms.

Any W/oman’sBlues it is much
more than a steamy Harlequin
love story. It is a serious
investigation into sexual and
emotional obsession. In a culture
where supposedly men and
women think about sex on the
average of every five minutes,
this book will change the way
you view intimacy.

Leila, a woman coming of age
in the sixties who sought her
escape in drugs, love affairs, and
fine wine, is much more than a
“debutramp" persona like those
in Jackie Collins’ novels. She
stumbles into the dark half of her
sexual self and emerges a more
balanced person for recognizing
the struggle of good and evil
within herself.

You should leave this book
with mixed emotions and if you
do, then Jong has accomplished
her task.

themselves murdering a family.

Meanwhile, in Becky's eyes,
Henry remains a knight in shining
armor. He is the only person in
her life who treats her well. Their
romance is Henry's one
glimmering hope for salvation.

Henry: Portrait of a Serlallaller
was shot in Chicago in 1986. It is
the product of a young director
with artistic ambitions and a
production company that wanted
a routine slasher ﬁlm. After seeing
convicted serial killer Henry lee
Lucas on "20/20,” Chicago
ﬁlmmaker John McNaughton
became interested in the
relationship between cinematic
and real—life horror.

Henrys real-life implications
—— the fact that serial killers walk
among us undetected, impossible
to capture — are frightening.
Here violence is shown so

“uncinematically,” not as a means
of action or suspense, but
something horrible and crushing
that happens every day to people
who in no way deserve it. This
kind of thing can be a much-
needed shock for action-movie
babies who think Schwarzen-
negger is just the coolest thing.
Henry also boasts solid, low-
budget direction and strong
performance from its three
principals actors: Rocker, Towles
and Arnold. Particularly
impressive is Arnold, who plays
Henry with eerie understatement.
Henryis a gritty, crazy depiction
of all those stories in the paper
that we don’t want to read, and
those neighborhoods in the big
cities that we don’t want to hear
about. Seeing Henry may min
your night, but (unlike The Cook,
Tbe Tbiejf His Wife and HerL01/er)

at least it will ruin it for a reason.
