Pitt took the first step last
Wednesday in alleviating its housing
problem when trustees approved con-
struction of a new $5.3 million resi-

dence hall.

The apartment-style
housing will accommo-
date ZO4 students ,and
Pitt is aiming to have

At the moment, no one is
contracted to begin the
project, but Pitt has taken
the initial step of getting
the ftmding in place.

The next step will be
to choose an architect
and a construction com-
pany. -

According to Pitt
spokesman Ken Service,
the University is receiv-
ing no state funds for the

project. Unlike the $38 million grant-
ed for the convocation center, the
commonwealth capital fund doesn’t
provide for new dormitories. So to
accommodate the increase of incom-

ing students, the University has to
borrow money to finance the new res-

-idence hall.

“It’s like building a house,”
Service said. “We can borrow the
money and pay it back over time.”

He said this is only one compo-
nent of an underlying “housing strate-
gy.” Speciﬁcs about the long-range
strategy are not yet available.

This is just the first step in the
University’s 10-year facilities plan
that promises to provide even more
housing by the year 2007.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
said the project goes beyond merely
providing additional space.

“We have taken a number of steps
to improve the quality of the residen-

Get your grades, toll-free

Aderonke Omotade
For The Pitt News

Members of SGB have proposed a
new system that would allow Pitt students
to call a toll-free number to receive their
semester grades just hours after their pro-
fessors turn them in to the registrar. This
system could begin as soon as December.

If approved, students would be able
to call anytime to ﬁnd out their grades in
individual classes, their QPA, their overall
GPA and the number of credits they’ve
eamed.

According to George Mongell, acad-
emic aifairs chairman for SGB, students

a would most likely enter the last four digits

of their social security number as their pin
number.

Ali Roberts, a CAS junior, said she
thinks the proposed service would be more
efﬁcient than the present one, with the most
noticeable advantage being its conve-
nience.

Sam Conti of the Registrar’s ofﬁce
said students would not have to worry
about not being at their home address to
receive their transcript, and also wouldn’t
have to worry about it getting lost in the

One big convenience is that students
would be able to receive their grades with-
in four hours of the time the professor sub-
mits them. For students who have to deal
with parents opening their grades, this ser-
vice might be a welcome relief.

As the present system works, pro-
fessors submit grades,

The toll-free  e  a i d which are then scanned
call would take ’ into the computer, sent
approximately two to the Registrar’s ofﬁce
minutes and would where they’re
include an advertise- processed, then printed
merit and a from the computer cen-

University-related
armouncement at the
beginning, a list of
options, and then

another’ advertise-
ment at the end of the
call.

Some of these
options might be for
students to ﬁnd out
about their ﬁnancial
or academic status or
to get a printed copy
of their . grades.
Students who want a printed copy of their
grades may be able to choose the option of
receiving a hard copy inthe mail in about a
week.

Students who choose this option will
still be eligible to receive a free unoﬁicial
student transcript during that semester.
However, they might only be able to
receive their grades within a certain time
period, and only from the most recent
semester.’

VV1th this move, the University will
join a legion of other schools such as Penn
State, Virrsconsin and Michigan that give
semester, grades over the phone. Pitt will
look at these pre—existing systems when
modeling their system, but it will be cus-
tomized to Pitt students, assured Mongell.

However, some students don’t think
this service is necessary.

“Students are not that eager to get
their grades,” said one student who wished
to remain anonymous. “We want stuff with
little effort as students. Why do I have to
call for my grades? It’s doing something
that’s unnecessary. And if students are anx-
ious to get their grades, ﬂiey can call the
professor on the phone, and simply ask for
their grades.”

For some students, the positive
aspects of the proposed service seem to
override the negative.

ter' and ﬁnally mailed
out.

Mongell said
Pitt will save “thou-
sands on the paper,
postage and manpow-
er.”

But Conti said
the proposed system
wouldn’t necessarily
mean a decrease in
manpower, because the
only work that would
change is that the com-
puter center wouldn’t print the grades and
the mail room would not have to send them
out. -

Conti said this “interactive voice
technology” would cost Pitt $2,500 to get
started and around $7,500 a year to operate.

’ The cost of printing and mailing
grades via ﬁrst class mail for Pitt students
is between $20—$25,000, according to
Conti.

Conti said it would be hard to say
how much money would be saved,
because it would depend on how many stu-
dents ask for a traditional printout of their
grades. ’

Meghan McGeary, a CAS junior, said
her sister has found a lot of problems with
the service at Penn State.

“It made a lot more mistakes and it
was harder to correct those mistakes,”
McGeary said. “And she had to wait for
days to get through. If [Pitt] could get
around it, then it would be possible.”

The grades-over-the—phone proposal
is still in its preliminary stages, so changes
may still be made.

A fomral proposal will be produced
by Sam Conti and presented to Provost
James Maher. If approved by the office of
the Provost, then the project will be able to
move ahead and would be in place for the
fall term. .

tial experience,” he said, “ranging from
wiring the residence halls for direct
Internet connections, to providing, more
indoor exercise and recreational facilities
for students.”

The University’s housing problem
has been viewed by some as a priority
problem.

Marshall Goodwin, president of the
Oakland Business and Civic Association,
has long criticized Pitt for using tax dol-
lars for everything except housing.
Goodwin was unavailable for comment.

Susan Golomb, president of the
Oakland Plarming and Development
Corp., said she is happy with the
University’s plans to build much needed
housing.

“We hoped there would be more,”
she said. “But we’re hoping it’s just the
first step [in increasing housing].”

Nordenberg publically recognized
this concern, saying the new dorms will
“address a signiﬁcant concern of our
neighbors here in Oakland.”

The new apartments will be built on
two University owned parking lots in the
area surrounded by Oakland Avenue,
Bouquet and Sennott Streets. Aside from
a 64—car parking garage replacing
Pennsylvania Hall, the University has

FROM PAGE 1

made no plans to replace this parking.

Each apartment will include individ-
ual bedrooms for four students, two bath-
rooms, a kitchen, and living and dining
area.

“The new residence hall will play a
key role in strengthening our student
housing options,” Nordenberg said, “and
help us guarantee four years of on—cam—
pus housing to entering students.”

The Pitt student community has been
somewhat dissatisfied with recent
attempts to accommodate the increase in
housing needs.

Pitt junior Phillip Sartori cited his
dissatisfaction with the transformation of
Sutherland Hall living rooms into bed-
rooms. .

“It just makes things too crowded,”
Sartori said.

Another student expressed similar
frustration with Pitt’s housing shortage.

“I couldn’t even get housing,” com-
plained a Pitt sophomore who wished to
remain anonymous. He said he’s trans-
ferring because he feels he missed out on
the “freshman community” so prevalent
in dormitories.

Nordenberg addressed these con-
cerns in his statement last Wednesday.

“A vibrant, attractive, academically-
oriented residential environment can
provide a much richer overall college
experience for our students,” he said.

IMPROVEMENTS

replace it with a 64-space parking garage.

Two weeks ago, the state announced
it had contracted Apostolou Associates of
Mount Washington and Rosser
International of Atlanta to design the $60
million convocation center.

Paul Apostolou, of Apostolou
Associates, said last week his company
must meet with the University or the state
to agree upon the complex’s speciﬁca-
tions before the blueprints can be started.

Aside from a basketball court and
locker rooms, no signiﬁcant speciﬁca-
tions for the center are in line yet, accord-
ing to Pitt spokesman Ken Service.

A few years ago, Golomb said the
community may not have shown much
support for Pitt’s expansion. But she said
her neighbors’ worry over parking is off-
set by the relief coming from new student

_ housing.

According to Golomb, when students
move into nicer housing in areas designat-
ed for them, it opens up the houses and
apartments in the community for more
permanent renters, promoting local
growth.

“The University building on Forbes
and Bouquet is great because it’s at the
edge of campus,” Golomb said. “If they
don’t go any further than that and we can
take everything west of there and start to
build it back up to where they once were.”

"Nordenberg said that although the
convocation center is the biggest and most
expensive improvement in the works, Pitt
is still aggressively working on renova-

FROM PAGE 1

tions and building new housing.

“We’re moving forward on so many
fronts right now,” Nordenberg said. “It’s
all part of the University’s 10-year facili-
ties plan.”

This plan is three-tiered, spanning
from 1998 to 2007, resulting from a com-
prehensive review of the University’s
needs for academic, athletic, student life
and recreational facilities.

Nordenberg announced the plan last
January when Pennsylvania Governor
Tom Ridge announced the state’s inten-
tion to give Pitt $138 million for campus
improvements and construction of the
convocation center.

The first tier includes short-terrn
improvements to be made within the next
four years. This most recent $27 million
worth of projects and classroom renova-
tions ﬁt under this tier.

The second tier is a continuation of
classroom renovation, improvements to
Hillman Library and any other housing
needs that arise. These will take between
ﬁve and seven years to complete, accord-
ing to the plan.

The third tier is comprised of long
term goals, including more renovations, to
be completed by 2007. No major con-
struction has yet been slated under this
tier. .

None of the longer term plans are def-
inite yet, according to Service. But he said
all of Pitt’s classrooms will be renovated
within the next 10 years.

The U.S. Postal Service received per-

from the current price.

, The date of the increase is not yet set,
though. Postal regulators doubt the rise is
needed before January, considering the Postal
Service has made a proﬁt of $1 billion amu-
ally for the past three years.

Some senior postal executives said they
will pressure the governors, who will meet
June 2, to impose the new rates as soon as
possible, perhaps within 90 days.

Along with the one-cent increase in let-

Tuition Account
Program cuts

enrollment fee,
waiting period

Harrisburg—— State Treasurer Barbara
Hafer today announced two key irr1prove—
ments to Pennsylvania’s Tuition Account
Program that she said, “will make TAP the
right choice for even more Pennsylvania
families who are trying to save for college.”

9 TAP enables families to buy tomorrow’s
college tuition at today’s lower prices, while
getting a tax break. Hafer said the already
popular plan — it has 20,000 participants —
has been enhanced by:

-Cutting from four years to one year the
waiting period between the time families pre-
purchase TAP Credits and the time they use
those credits to pay for college.

-Reducing the enrollment fee from $65
to $50.

“The previous four—year waiting period
effectively locked out high-schoolers and
their parents as prospective participants,”
Hafer said. “Just when families were most

likely to be focusing on how to pay for col-
lege, we were turning them away because
when they purchased tuition through TAP,

' those tuition credits couldn’t be used for four

years.” -

In addition, families who use higher-risk I
investments, such as mutual funds, will now
be able to move money into safe, guaranteed
TAP accounts as their child gets closer to col-
lege age, Hafer noted.

And with the change, she said, ‘TAP
Credits become a perfect high school gradu-
ation gift: Friends and relatives can contribute
to aTAPaccount, whichcanbe usedtopay
tuition at any accredited college, university,
trade or technical school — public or private,
anywhere in the country.” ' '

The Tuition Account Program Advisory
Board approved the reduced waiting period
April 29, agreeing it will enable TAP to serve
the families . of the 600,000 Pemrsylvania
children currently enrolled in grades 9-12.

  step for big problem

New housing. “Fantastic, wonderful. It’s
about time,” one might say, but only if the hous-
ing in question actually housed a substantial
amount of students and alleviated the over-
crowding problem.

The fact is, the new university housing com-
plex, to be built for the Fall of 1999 on Bouquet
Street, will house approximately 204 students in
51 apartments. This complex is a rather slow
start to Pitt’s 10-year facilities plan.

It is amusing to note that last fallSutherland
Hall held 208 students more than the 624 it was
designed to house.

It’s as if Pitt looked at last year’s number of
excess students in one particular residence hall,
and decided that’s the number of students that
should go in the new complex. While students
appreciate the addition of a new housing com-
plex, this building seems nothing more than a
halfhearted attempt, considering Pitt wants to
enroll even more freshmen than it did last year.
It’s an idea tantamount to fixing a smashed car
hood by merely spraying paint over the dents.

Besides, overcrowding was prevalent not
just in Sutherland Hall, but in the Towers as
well. With students who decide not to move off-
campus, coupled with the new freshman class,
which is predicted to get marginally bigger
every year, there will still be overcrowding in
1999. ‘

One of the reasons students transfer out of
Pitt is —- surprise —— poor housing, especially
overcrowding. This band-aid over a gaping
wound will not alleviate this common griev-
ance.

If Pitt wants to enroll a bigger freshman
class, and manage to house its current students,
it needs to construct a high—occupancy dorm -
a building the same size as Lothrop Hall or
Sutherland Hall. The proposed housing complex
on Bouquet Street will cost $5.3 million. But for
$5 million more, the whole housing problem
might be solved. Though the $138 million grant
from the State can’t be used for housing, it does
take care of major projects which were given
priority, freeing up Pitt’s money.

The proposed new building is a step in the
right direction, but with only 204 students to be
housed, many more steps are needed.

Neoconservatism under-
mines America’s past

The recent release of the
Mississippi Sovereignty Commission
files should be a cause for reﬂection.
Granted, the ﬁles simply let us know
the ﬁner details of a larger story we
all knew: that the government of the
state of Mississippi used spying,
bribery, extortion and other criminal
tactics to intimidate civil rights work-
ers and to protect segregation. But the
files serve as a reminder not only of
the depravity of the powers-that—be,
but of the unparalleled courage of
those who took a stand for justice in
those years.

Most of them did not even carry
weapons to defend themselves, and

’ yet they threw themselves into the

struggle against injustice in a state
where the government not only
refused to guarantee their safety, but
sought to neutralize them at every
opportunity. All of them took great
risks, and a great many —
let us remember Medgar
Evers, Andrew Goodman,
James Chaney and Mickey
Schwemer —- paid with
their lives.

It is right and necessary to invoke
the memory of these courageous souls
to whom we owe so much. Their
steadfast example ought to be enough
to shame some of us. During the life-
time of today’s university students it
has become fashionable to deride such
depths of human commitment as fool-
hardy, as un—American, or as relics of
the Sixties. As one perceptive individ-
ual noted, the Sixties are the favorite
target of those who take delight in the
failure of dreams, and you can find an
abundance of those who take such
delight on television, in the op—ed
pages, at right—wing think tanks, and
in slick neoconservative magazines.

This attitude of smug apologetics
for injustice is systematically cultivat-
ed by those who stand to benefit the
most from it. Richard Mellon Scaife,
Joseph Coors, and a multitude of
other wealthy individuals and corpo-
rations ladle out cash to organizations
like the Heritage Foundation, the
American Enterprise Institute (AEI),
the Cato Institute and the Independent
Women’s Forum (an Orwellian name
if there ever was one). These think
tanks provide money and public expo-
sure to the commentators who domi-
nate the American news media, on
television and in print. They are also
continuously sowing the next crop of
smug young right—wing pundits.

JOHN

LACNY

COLUMNIST

 

When carrying out this latter task,
the think tanks know where to look:
the nationwide network of right—wing
campus newspapers, usually funded
by the same kinds of sources (Scaife,
et. al.). Here can be found some of the
most loathsome junior bigots in the
country, many of whom can be turned
into effective ideological hit men for
the rich and powerful with a suitable
grant from AEI or Heritage.

The Dartmouth Review, for
example, has cursed us with both
Dinesh D’Souza and Laura Ingraham.
D’Souza, a hanger-on at AEI, is con-
vinced that African-Americans no
longer suffer because of racism, and
has dedicated his life to persuading
the rest of us as to the validity of this
contention. Ingraham, a notorious
member of the so-called Independent
Women’s Forum, claims that the glass
ceiling for women no longer exists
and regularly pens op-ed
columns to this effect.

When Ingraham was
editor of the Dartmouth
Review, she sent a reporter
to infiltrate a meeting of
the Gay Students’ Association and
secretly make a recording. The
Review then published transcripts of
the meeting and sent them to the par-
ents of the students who had attended,
“outing” them against their will. If
this does not give you enough indica-
tion of the reigning mentality at this
vile little rag, note also that its staff
once held a lobster and champagne
dinner on the same day other students
had scheduled events to combat world
hunger. '

A belief in the notion that the
ideal human being is a selfishly
acquisitive “rugged individualist,” a
conviction that one deserves one’s
own place at the top of a Social
Darwinist hierarchy, a callused disre-
gard for the disadvantaged, a dismis-
sive attitude toward those who hope
for a better world — these are the
required characteristics for anyone
who is eager to get a fat cash grant
from the Heritage Foundation.

As for the rest of us, as the sum-
mer approaches, we would do best to
emulate in some small way the spirit
of those who stood for justice in
Mississippi during that first freedom
summer over three decades ago.

Rumincliions on high fructose cornsyrup

Joseph

Gielata

“Baloneyl,” my amigo called my
claim that the world will end in 1999.
His rival theory is that the apocalypse
will take place in the year 666, which in
god years is yet to come. I was curious as
to why he had not employed the custom-
ary “Bullcrap!” (or its brother term) to
denounce my comment, and I scrambled
to the fridge to discover what qualiﬁed
“bologna” to be an invective in addition
to signifying a so-called meat. His com-
ment thus initiated a quest which would
ultimately lead me to a disturbing recog-
nition piercing to the very heart of the
American stomach.

Just three places after “mechanically.

separated chicken” (the main component
of bologna) in the list of ingredients,I
noticed “corn syrup.” Acting on a hunch,
I checked the components of Heinz
ketchup only to find that in third place
appeared “high fructose corn syrup”
again. Becoming agitated, I checked sev-
eral other condiments — including BBQ
sauce, steak sauce and pancake syrup -
and it turned out that high fructose corn
syrup was the prime ingredient in all of
them! The Worcestershire sauce and
peanut butter also registered high fruc-
tose corn syrup as a dominant ingredient.
The chocolate sauce and even the jams
revealed themselves to be primarily corn
syrup. I turned my attention to bever-
ages, and there, too, corn syrup was the
common ingredient. Of course, all car-
bonated beverages are mainly corn syrup
mixed with carbonated water (along with
some ﬂavoring as an afterthought) but
many of the fruit juices have a good deal
of corn syrup as well. I had come upon a
signiﬁcant pattern and I had to follow it
to the end. -

It’s still interesting today to read

about the pre—Socratic philosophers,

many of whom were concerned with
exposing a single material underlying all
things. Thales recommended water as
the “material principle” and Anaximenes
suggested air. Recalling
that spirit, and in ‘
light of my fridge ,-
research, I guessed '
that corn syrup was the
distinctive essence of
American taste. Look in
your fridge —— you’ll see.
Corn syrup seems to pervade
the United States’ culinary
landscape in not-so-obvious
ways. Note the faint sweetness
of the meats from your deli, the
sauces on restaurant sandwiches 
and the various marinades. If 1
Nietzsche were an American, he
might’ve written about the Will to
Sweetness instead. _

Corn syrup is everywhere! How can
one cope with such an insistence on the
high fructose substance? My amigo, ever
ready to help, suggested, “Drink
whiskey and malt liquor. No sugar there,
hombre!” Alas, alcohol is fermented

   
   
  
   
 
   
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  

sugar. In an effort to calm my troubled»

nerves I accepted a swig of his dwindling
bottle anyway, to little effect. Just then
“Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser”
(incidentally, Rukeyser is perhaps the
most under-appreciated TV personality)
came on and the show was prefaced by
some familiar Archer Daniels Midland
propaganda. I paid closer attention this
time as the ADM voice related that com
had more uses than I can now remember
(and I, having read a George Washington
Carver bio long ago, thought the peanut

‘was useful!).

At that point I remembered reading

about the govemment’s substantial price
supports on sugar, without which high
fructose corn syrup would not be prof-
itable. ADM happens to be one of the
major (if not THE major) producers of
corn syrup in this country and the corpo-
ration seems to have gone to significant
lengths to get government action restrict-
ing imports of sugar and imposing mini-
mum prices. It is at least partially due to
the artiﬁcial price of sugar that I face so
much goddamn corn syrup when I visit
the fridge. For instance, Coca—Co1a used
to use sugar but they
switched» when sugar became
more expensive than corn
syrup. Wondering how
to rectify such an intoler-
able situation, I explained
it to my amigo who, sensi-
bly enough, asked, “What
i would the Europeans
do?” “Well,” I
replied, “naturally,
the Europeans
would institute
government price
supports on the
corn syrup to
counteract the
sugar price sup-
ports until
~ corn syrup
1, b e c o m e s
more expen-
sive than sugar. That’s the European
way.”

Asa result of some further inquiry,
my resistance to corn syrup is now three-
fold: 1) It isn’t as pleasing to the tongue
as sugar —_— indeed, usually gum has to
be added to the corn syrup to make it
heavier and thus more “tongue-friend-
ly”; 2) The molecular structure of corn
syrup is such that, unlike sugar, .there is

excess fructose which messes with the
digestive process (although com syrup
doesn’t wreak nearly as much havoc as
malt liquor) and 3) there’s just so darrm
much of it EVERYWHERE. Partially
hydrogenated vegetable oils and xanthan
gum seem to pop up a lot in ingredient
lists too, but nothing appears as com-
monly as corn syrup.

Of course, corn syrup has certain
respectable uses. There is no substitute
for good ol’ Karo corn syrup when it
comes to making fake blood just add red
food coloring. And my amigo reports
that a friend once injected Karo via a
hypodermic syringe, yielding a welcome
though not particularly remarkable high
(is there anyone more desperate, and
thus more inventive, than someone look-
ing for a high? For example, who
would’ve thought to snort 3M
ScotchGard carpet cleaner?) But for the
purposes of ordinary consumption to sat-
isfy the seemingly inﬁnite desire for
sweetness in this country, sugar is
undoubtedly preferable.

1 I’ve avoided the examination of a
much more profound dilemma, however.
Why do Americans want everything to
be so sweet? Why can’t other ﬂavors and
aspects of food be allowed to come
through without drowning them in corn
syrup? Must common American taste be
so homogeneous? I thought that at this
age we were supposed to put away child-
ish things like a sweet tooth, but that
doesn’t seem to be the case. Instead, high
fructose corn syrup assails us from all
sides, and the future holds no hope as

long as ADM holds the sugar industry by

the political testicles. We’re all stuck in
the culinary equivalent of hell.

Joseph Gielata’s sweet tooth is regularly
soured by St. Ides malt liquor:

Few things that require mas-
sive maintenance last for a cen-
tury. The United States of
America has only been around
for a little more than two.

Nonetheless, Kennywood
has survived and thrived for 100
years because it’s proven tobe
highly adaptable. During the
Depression, its changing focus
from roller coasters to dance
halls kept the park in business.
In recent years, crowds have
clamored for big, fast rides.
Kennywood has followed the
trend while keeping up with tra-
ditions that display pride in
their earlier years.

Kennywood has received
international recognition and is
highly acclaimed by some
roller-coaster addicts’ asso-
ciations. But just as a

attendees can see
near the top. And besides, the
Steel Phantom may not be the
highest roller coaster in the
world anymore, but that doesn’t
diminish its fun quotient. It’s
still high enough and fast
enough to triple the pulse rate.

‘ But these kudos are some-
thing to fall back on — some-
thing to grasp at in desperation
when trying to justify an hour-
long wait in line for a fifteen-
second ride. The plaque
announcing the roller-coaster
addicts’ endorsement of the
Pittfall is next to the winding
mile—long line corral, offering
encouragement.

While in line for the Pittfall,
one bit of conversation was
seared into my memory. “Look
at that,” one junior-high girl
said, pointing to the ride.
“There’s duct tape on that
cable!” Sure enough, the cable
appeared to be repaired with
duct tape. No matter. We were
not about to get out of a line in
which we had already waited 40
minutes. If we died, at least we
would die knowing our wait
hadn’t been for nothing.

Despite the Pittfa1l’s line,
the ride was exhilarating an!’
almost worth the wait. Almos

well worth the price of admis-
sion. The park offers group days
that can either enhance or put a
damper on your outing. If large
crowds are preferred, then by
all means go on a group day.

Cedar Point may be the
mother of all roller—coaster
amusement” parks, but
Kennywood is worth all the
praise it gets from hometown
visitors and those that make the
pilgrimage to the ‘Burgh’s local
mecca. And not all days are
likely to be as crowded as the
first one. So get a little sun,
learn a little history and enjoy a
summer tradition.

The film would flow better with
a shorter running time. It is nearly
three hours — a merciless time dur-

falls for Redford, a guy nearly thir-
ty years her senior. It’s not particu-
larly pleasant.

Also, the story is firmly ground-
ed in pretense. Annie is portrayed

family is estranged. But the men,
both Robert and Tom, are noble and
self—assured. There’s nothing like a
little chauvinism in contemporary
film.

It seems the only thing that can
help Annie is some home cooking
and good ol’ country simplicity —
she even line-dances. Although the

Though Soulﬂy sounds like the name
of a band that should be providing music
for ‘70s blaxploitation movie soundtracks,
the now defunct Sepultura’s frontrnan Max
Cavalera’s new band (or as he calls it,
“tribe”) continues where
Sepultura’s last album, Roots,
left off, mixing Brazilian
tribal music with black
metal. For all intents
and purposes,
Soulﬂy’s self—titled
album should be

 
  
  
   
 
  
   

THE Pin News

1996 (murder or accident, depending on
which magazine one reads), as well as God
and the late Brazilian author Chico
Science. This is a big difference from the
“Fuck shit up!” dedication of Sepultura’s
Chaos A.D.
The album deals with issues as vast as
the brutal colonial rule of the
Portuguese, people getting
away with murder, eco-
nomic disparity in Brazil,
mainstream attitudes
(one can’t help but
love a song with
lyrics that include

called Roots II. “No Muthafuckin’
Soulﬂy mixes Hootie & the
metal with Blowﬁshl”), and
Brazilian tribal even ‘ Brazil’s
music, coming national pastime
up with a hard— —- futebol (soc-
edged, esoteric cer).
— and at times, On the whole,
unbalanced —-- it’s a good hard-

sound. Though the
album contains suf-
ficient amounts of
rage and anger, both
lyrically and musically,
it has quiet, reﬂective
moments, which can be,
depending on one’s disposition,
quite irritating.

According to Max Cavalera, Soulﬂy
is so—called because it refers to the soul ﬂy-
ing free. The album (two songs in particu-
lar) is dedicated to Dana Wells, Max’s 21
year—old stepson who died in a car crash in

   
 
 
   
  
  
 

edged album, with
some songs that
really kick der-
riere, blending
tribal Indian drums with
crunchy electric guitar
riffs. Though it does not
come close to the majesty of

Sepu1tura’s Beneath the Remains and -

Chaos A.D., Cavalera’s new “tri ” can
turn out majestic moshpit tunes.

But if you did not like Sepultura’s
Roots and its eclectic experimentation, you
will not appreciate Soulﬂy.

Trade Jagr for th
future ofthe team

Even though they struggled last year,
and even though I hate their guts, I’ve got
to admit the Dallas Cowboys are probably
the NFL’s team of the decade. They rose
from being the worstteamin the league in
1988 to winning three Superbowls in four
years during the '90s. ’

Herschel Walker had more to do with
building the Cowboys into champions
than any of the stars who actually played
on those championship teams.

During the late '80s, Walker was one
of the best running backs in football. As
the team around him crumbled, Walker
still put up pro bowl numbers. Then the
Cowboys traded him to the Minnesota
Vikings. .

Why would a struggling team trade
away their only star player? Because of the
staggering amount they got in return.

The ‘Boys got a boatload of draft
picks and young players, many of whom
developed intothe starsthatled theteamto
Superbowl victories just a few years later.

You’re probably wondering what the
Herschel Walker saga in Dallas 10 years
ago has to do with Pittsburgh today. Take
a look at the ﬂormdering hockey team in
this town and you’ll see some startling
similarities. . ‘

A once great team clinging to one
mega-star is on a steady fall from grace.
True, the Penguins and Jaromir Jagr
haven’t sunk as low as the '88 Cowboys,
but the Pens are perennial underachievers.

I_ know I’m in the minority, but the
only way I see to correct the problem _is to
trade J agr.

Jagr is arguably the most talented
player in the NHL, and after this town’s
hockey savior, Mario Lernieux, retired last
year,theownerst1nnedtoJagrwitha$68
million contract and asked him to step into
Mario’s old all-world role.

Unfortunately, Jagr is not and never
will be Mario Iemieux. Pittsburghers will
never like J aromir the way they did Mario,
no matter how many goals the Czech
scores (he lead the league last year).

Jagr mouths off, complaining about
coach _ Kevin Constantine. That kind of
behavior is something Pittsburgh sports
fans have never tolerated In addition, Jagr
is not as active in the community as
Pittsbu@'s beloved Mario. People here
just don’t take to him in the same way.

The result was empty seats in the
Civic Arena all season’ long, despite the
team's successful win—loss record Ticket
prices were staggering, mainly because the
team had to pay off Jagr’s huge contract.

Most people argue my point, claim-
ing it would be a public relations night-

Baseball finishes season with a bang

Patrick Robertson

Sports Edltor

The Pittsburgh Panther baseball team
has been busier than most Pitt students -
since the last day of ﬁnals, going 4-4 to
finish their season with a losing record,
12-27-1.

The Panthers lost their last game 12-

   

victorious against Kent State 149. First

baseman Steve Dickerson hit two homers

in the game, tying for the all-tirne Panther
home run mark at 20. Former Panther
    

9 to Boston College. The Eagles had a  

big ﬁfth inning, scoring ﬁve I'lll’lS and fm-
ishing Pitt's season with another loss.
BC also had a four—run seventh
inning. Chang Choe’s grand slam, his
second homer of the game, accounted for
all four of these runs off of Panther

‘ reliever Kevin Lazeski.

Jory Coughenour started the game

   

for Pitt and gave up nine runs, eight of  

which were earned in six innings.

The Panthers did manage some hit-
ting by grinding out nine runs. David
Hoopes hit a home run in the game to
contribute to the cause.

Before the fifth inning, Pitt led 4-3.
The Panthers plated two in the seventh to
make it an 8-6 ballgame before the grand
slam in the bottom of the inning. Hoopes’
home run came in the ninth to close the
scoring.

“Our guys were more patient at the
plate, and they started to understand our
offensive philosophy,” Head Coach Joe
J ordano said. ' _

A few days before, the Panthers were

  

 ‘..4é.. .

Steve Dicinson belted two me runs 
tie the Pitt record last week against BC.

Brian Lohrnanheld, who played for Pitt
from 1985-1988, shares that record with
Dickerson. "

“He got a hold of a couple. He has had

some problems at the plate all season that ‘

he never straightened out, but he is so

powerful that those two just ﬂew out of
the ballpark,” Jordano said.

Darrin Lenhart also took two out of
the ballpark. The Panthers scored four
runs in the ﬁrst and fifth innings.
The game remained close most of
the way, but Pitt held the lead from
the second inning on.

Two of Pitt's other three wins
over the last two weeks came
against Big East foe Seton Hall. In
the ﬁrst game of a doubleheader the
Panthers beat the Pirates 2-1.

Lenhart hit his only other home
run of the season in this game to go
along with a Lou Meluci RBI single.

~  U) Coughenour picked up the win,

pitching six and two—thirds innings.
Matt Irvin saved the game, giving up
two hits in his' two and one-third
innings of work.

In the second game, Pitt managed
only four hits and lost 8-0. The
Pirates put together nine hits, includ-
ing two home runs. John Schultz
started the game for the Panthers and
gave up all eight runs.

The next day, Pitt came back with
a vengeance to take the rubber game
of the series 11-0. Jason Oliver and Steve
Dickinson went yard for the Panthers,
while Bob Balazentis pitched a complete
game. Balazentis scattered four hits over

Pitt announces improvements to athletic facilities

Brian Knavlsh

Column, page 14

Assistant sports Edltor

“Pitt’s facilities suck!”

We’ve heard coaches, players and fans
complain about the deplorable conditon of
Pitt’s athletic facilities for years, but now,
ﬁnally, things are changing.

Thanks in large part to Pitt Athletics
Director/savior Steve Pederson, more
money has been committed to facility reno-
vation projects in the past year than in entire
decades preceding it. February’s armounce-

ment of plans to construct a convocation

center was the big daddy, but last week the
University announced its plans for four
other substantial facility renovations with a
cost totaling $7,171,500.

Fitzgerald Field House - While the
men’s and women’s basketball teams will
move into the Convocation Center in a cou-
ple of years, the wrestling, volleyball, track,
and gymnastics teams will still reside in the
Field House, making the renovation of the
building welcome.

The $3.2 million facelift will include an
expansion and renovation, of the ground
ﬂoor of the building, the site of the cramped

locker rooms. Because of the sardine-like
conditions, teams currently are forced to
share locker rooms, an unheard of practice

for a school the size of Pitt.

“Anytime a facility is renovated, every-
one who uses the facility beneﬁts,”
Volleyball Head Coach Cindy Alvear said.
“Just like if you’re renting a house, it’s more
enticing to have your own room than if
you're sharing it with nine other people. It
will certainly help our recruiting if we have
our own locker room.”

Tennis Courts - “Hail to Pitt” will be
no more. Well, at least not on the side of
Pemrsylvania Hall. That building will be
leveled to make way for a new tennis
court/parking facility. ‘

The $1,495,000 project will include
three enclosed tennis courts built on top of a
small, 64-space parking garage.

The project will improve the facility for
tennis while removing the need for tennis
courts in the Cost Sports Center.

Baseball Field - The only Pitt facility
arguably more embarrassing than the Field
House has been Trees Field, home of Pitt’s
baseball team. The $1.25 million commit-
ted to renovating that ﬁeld should make life

much easier for the baseball team.

The project includes adding lights so
that night games can be played and replac-
ing the currently rocky inﬁeld with artiﬁcial
turf. This renovation will not only benefit
the baseball team, but the intramural pro-
grams as well.

“We’re thrilled. I think it’ll help the
program tremendously,” Head Coach Joe
J ordano said. “It’ll give us a top-notch facil-
itysowecancornpetewithotherteamsin
the Big East that we’re recruiting against.”

Cost Sports Center - The ﬁnal project
in this wave of facilities renovations is the
resurfacing of the ﬁeld in the Cost Sports
Center. \V1th the tennis courts out of the
way and brand new artiﬁcial turf on the
ground, the center will be more effective as

an indoor practice facility for football, soc-

cer, baseball and other recreational activi-
ties.

Despite the signiﬁcance of the four
projects, the communication within the
University’s hierarchy was surprisingly
inefﬁcient. Alvear and Tennis Coach
George Dieffenbach did not even know
about the projects ﬁve days after The Pitt
News received a press release on the matter.

mare to trade Jagr. They say, “You think
there are empty seats now, imagine if you
traded Jagr just one year after Mario
retired. No one would come.”

Bullshit.

Just like the Herschel Walker situa-
tion, the Penguins could either keep J agr
and his $68 million contract and not sell
out, or trade him, save a ton of money
and not sell out. The team lost $10 mil-
lion last season, so I think the decision is
obvious.

The amount of young talent the
Penguins" could get in return for Jagr
would be enough to build a champi-
onship caliber team for the next ten years.

Ever notice which Penguin gets the
biggest ovation during the games?
Bruiser Darius Kasparaitis, not Jagr.
Pittsburghers love tough, physical teams
(see: Steel Curtain), not long-haired pret-
ty boys like Jagr.

If the Pens brought in more players
like Kasparaitis and put a big checking
team on the ice, a team like the
Philadelphia Flyers, the Arena would sell
out every night. :

Editor of The Pitt News.

nine innings to get his second win of the
season.

Balazentis earned Big East
Conference Pitcher of the Week honors
from the dominating performance

On April 28, Pitt was shut out by
Youngstown State. The Penguins won
3-0 and allowed the Panthers only four
hits.

Pitt’s only other win came against
West Virginia. Melucci hit his fourth
home run of the season, and Balazentis
threw another complete game.

The Panthers dipped from a 24-20-
6 record last year to 12-27-1 this year
under new Head Coach Joe Jordano.

“It was a challenging season for us.
It took us a while to get our new
philosophies across on and 0E the ﬁeld.
Now that we have taken care of off the
ﬁeld, next year we should be able to
focus all of our attention on what we do
on the ﬁeld,” J ordano said.

Mengerink wins Freshman of the Year honors

Brian Knavish

Assistant Sports Editor

Nick Mengerink’s wrestling resume:
two—time high school state champion, one-
time high school national champion, the
most wins ever by a Pitt freshman and the
second Pitt freshman All-American. Now he
can add the 1998 Eastern Wrestling League
Freshman of 
the Year and
Academic All-

 

   

year, and Chad Jesko captured the honor in
1995.

Mengerink’s unbelievable 344 record
highlighted his freshman season that saw
him go as far as capturing All-American
honors at the NCAA championships.

“He was pretty much the hands—down
favorite to win the award,” Assistant Coach
Ed Palmer said. “It’s a great honor to have
those guys on
our team. You

and come back
and work harder.”

Mengerink proved he is just as skilled in
the classroom as he is on the wrestling mat
His continuous ﬁght to a 3.47 QPA as a biol-
ogy major landed him Academic All-
American honors.

Many experts in the wrestling ﬁeld

 

agree that Mengerink is of a rare breed, the
type of athlete with the highest level of ded-
ication and talent necessary to become a col-
legiate national champ.

Wrestling fans got a glimpse of that ﬁre
in Mengerink’s courageous performance last
March at the NCAA tournament. During
one of his matches, Mengerink tore his
biceps muscle from his pectoral muscle, an
excruciatingly painful injury.

But Mengerink didn’t tell anyone of his
injury at the time. He continued wrestling
until he secured eighth place, giving him All-
American honors. He undoubtedly would
have ﬁnished higher if he hadn’t gotten hurt.

“It doesn’t really hurt anymore; it’s a lit-
tle uncomfortable though. I’m slowly getting
my strength back, but it’ll never be as strong
as it was before the injury,” he explained

Because of the location of the tear in his
muscle, surgery is impossible. Mengerink
explained that instead of operating, they will
let the injury “scar up”, rehabilitate the mus-
cle, and allow it to heal naturally.

The injury will prevent him from com-
peting in this surnmer’s free style tourna-

ments, but those familiar with his. perfor-

mance expect this injury to have no perma-
nent damage on his wrestling ability and
expect him to be back in top form come the
regular season. Those who know him well
expect him to be even better
