M   After Poor Start,

  

  

 , With the decisive victory over Penn

 Mther returned to his den, not to ap-

" _pear.M again until the season of 1924.

gardless of a bad. start, he ﬁnally
_ _. -came out on top, having ﬁve wins and
 ~  four defeats. .;M _ -
'_  ‘Of the defeats handed the Pitt ma-
  ‘chine, notone was by ‘a margin great-
F or than. six points," which‘ goes to
 prove that no ‘opposing team had an
 “outstanding edge over our «M aggrega-
--  “tion.-. Our, opponents’ total in points

 a ‘ ‘was 4, while_t,‘;._~l“.\.Blue and Gold gath-'

-erod to its .criF?ut almost double this
 number, netting 83. Losing by a ﬁeld
‘goal to Syracuse and a lone touch-
down being the niargin of -the other

 strong on the defense“and' needed only

A‘  While the University of Pittsburgh

that the Panthe_r would be lucky if it
M jwonthe majority of games played this
season. ‘He said this because of the

 ‘ In" departing fromour midst, the Pan-.

our line for twotouchdowns. In the
second half, however, with Johnson at
center and Murdoch replaced ‘ at

strength and scored its lone touch-_
down on the Morgantown lads._ The

the West Virginia team worked‘about-
the wonderful generalship and play-
ing..of Nardacci. M M , '
The second defeat of the season was
handed to Pitt when Syracuse Univer-
sity was met at the Yankee‘ Stadium
in New YorkACity. The Orange was
unable to penetrate the Pantherline,
being unable to score one tiinewhen
a fumble placed the‘ pigskin on the
two-footline. The lone points of the
tangle“-.._were '.Ath'ree,A. a beautiful ‘kick
overfthe goal posts by McBride in the
third quarter. -Flanagan distinguished
himself ‘in. this game, by his brilliant
kicking, tackling, running,
and -general , playing, 1 while Johnson

lights for the Syracuse team. ’ _
What was -- expected to be _“Cake”
for the “Pitt team was now in order.

The Carnegie Institute of Technology °

was taken .on.by the Pitt Panther at
Forbes Field. 'Th'e'batt1e ended 7-2
in favor of the Scotch. Although the
Tartan was outplayed,’ outgained and‘

its clan‘, and that is all that they were
there for. The only points scored for
old ‘Uni were'..the ‘two . made. when
Marsh Johnson brokeinfand blocked.

behind his -own goal line,
team could cross the goal line in the
ﬁrst half, but in the second period,
the Plaid, on the kickoff surprised the
Blue and Gold with the old shoe-string
play and in just two plays Jimmy
Robertson scored the lone touchdown
of the ﬁght. The stellar work of Hoot
Flan,agan,.Jakie Bohren and Gustafson
for Pitt, and,Robinson for Tech was
the highspots of the game.

For the fourth time,“-the Pitt Pan-_
ther went down to defeat when it met
the University of Pennsylvania "at
Philadelphia. ‘ The game‘ was‘ hard
fought, butia costly fumble by Flan-
aganwhich Waslrecovered by Thomas
gave old Penn the decision 6-0 before

thegreat crowd of 56,000. In the last ’

half Pitt resorted to’ a passing game,
but her chances for scoring were
nipped when Jap Bohren.-dropped a
forward pass behindfthe Penn goal
line. ,Gwosden, Bohren, Gustafson and
Captain Jordan, were the stars for
the Pitt team, while Hammer and
Thomas played real football for the
hometeam. ~ _ i . .
MNext on the card ‘was the Grove
City College team. which Pitt met. at
Forbes Field. The weakened varsity
defeated the visitors in a closesgame
13-7. ‘Chalky Williamson and Charley

coaches in this. batvtle,--Mhav-ing a classy
