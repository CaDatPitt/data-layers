Conference Points Out
Need for International

C‘ Center in Pittsburgh

. By JAY GLASSER
The need for an international center in the Pittsburgh

area was pointed out by Dr. Shepherd L. Whitman, main..

speaker at a -recent conference sponsored by the Interna-
tional Students’ Organization. A

A center here in Pittsburgh would service the needs of the entire
tri-state area. According to Dr. Whitman, it would be a meeting ‘place
for foreign students, foreign visitors, businessmen, patrons of civic
groups, college faculties, and groups interested in international and
intercultural affairs. ' A ‘

The center would be of special importance to foreign students.
Servinglas an orientation .and information center about the United
States, it would also provide a place for students to practice English,
an area for recreation, and a “home” where students could bring
their friends. '

‘ One of the primary features of the center would be to bring to-
gether under a single roof all of the offices. and administrative facil-
ities of international organizations. It would also provide a place
for trade meetings and an exhibit area for products of this area.
Students would be available to act as advisors on their respective
countries to the business groups.

Dr. Whitman cited reasons why a separate building would be
needed to house the center. Most important is the need for space
to housethe oifices, conference rooms, libraries, living and recreation
facilities which are necessary.

The organizations which would use the center, such as the In-
ternational Students’ Organization, the Pittsburgh Council for Inter-
national Visitors, and the United Nations Association, -have been

' working from their separate offices for the creation of the structure

which would serve as a physical symbol of international under-
standing.

Rabbi States Value  
OfRights Movement

Rabbi Richard L. Rubenstein,_Univers-
ity Chaplain, has issued the following state-
ment concerning the charges and counter-
charges in the controversy over the student
demonstrations in Montgomery and his du-

ties to all students in general. a _
‘ “My primary duty as Hillel Director and Uni-

versity Chaplain is to be mindful at all times of
the safety of students at the colleges and un1Ve1‘-
sities in the Pittsburgh area.
I owe this responsibiilty to
my own conscience, to my
students and to their parents.
“I believe in the Civil Rights
movement and I am utterly
convinced that the enormous
gains, which have been made
in the extension of equal
rights to all Americans would
have been impossible without
it. The Civil Rights move-
ment deserves the support of
all who have a vision of a great American future.
Dr. Martin Luther King is the hope, not only of
his own'people, but of all Americans.
“Inevitably, any mass movement involving mil-
lions of people attracts fringe elements. The iden-
,ti_ﬁcati_on_ of V these, elements should  no way dc“
‘tract from the aims" of the leadership of the Civil

Rights movement itself.

“I have read the published remarks of Father
Xavier Carroll, Father Donald McIlv.ane, and the
48 students who have taken exception to my orig-
inal statement at the Pitt rally, to the effect that
our Northern students were mislead about impor-
tant details of the demonstration.

“I have great respect for Father Mcllvane,
Father Carroll, and‘ the students and do not wish
to enter into public controversy with them. Never-
theless, I believe my original statement was true
and that is was my clear "and unmistakable duty

to issue it.

Freedom Rally Draws
Diversified Audience

A Freedom Rally attracted a small but diverse audi-
ence in the Tower’s lobby Tuesday night.

While Dr. David Montgomery, assistant professor of
history, emphasized the need for students of the University
to act with this community, a group of hecklers gathered. These stu-
dents, most of them athletes, kept up a steady undertone throughout

Ross Danielson, editor of Ideas and Figures; Eric Stern, president
of Student Government, and Joseph Centifani spoke. Danielson ad-
dressed the students in reference to civil rights and invited students
to ask questions. Stern extended this invitation to the hecklers.

When Stern asked for speakers with opposing views, one boy
from the audience came forward and stepped onto the platform. After _
receiving applause from his fellows, the boy walked away speechless.
Stern encouraged him to say something‘, but there was only silence.

Centifani spoke to certain individuals he knew from his home-
town area and reminded’ them that Eastern Pennsylvania thrives
from coal mines. About two generations ago, he added, the managers
of these mines walked around with whips to, beat the workers just

University Remains
Neutral on Bus Trip;

“We did not endorse the trip to Ala
bama., nor did we oppose it,” Chancellor Ed
ward H. Litchﬁel-d said in a statementﬂis
sued today concerning the University!
position on the recent student trip to'Ala
bama.

The official statement includes four maim-
points. ' ‘ ‘

First, “The University does not, as an institu- '.
tion, take action on political issues. ‘It never has,
done so, and, in my judgment, ~
it never should.”

In his second point Dr.
Litchﬁeld stressed that a stu-
dent’s decision must be guided
by “his own conscience in so
far as the moral and social
issues are concerned” and “the
academic consequences of his
actions.”

Thirdly, he said that “These
are ‘moving moments in the Litchﬁeld
life of our generation generally and in the liv'
of students particularly. Our students, more than,
their elders,’ are acutely aware of the Wounds our
society inﬂicts upon itself.”

"He pointed out that since students do not ‘all;
agree on the issue thelstudent body and its 
versity can not be expected to agree. ,

Lastly, the Chancellor said that the University
encourages each student “to do what he considers.
appropriate to pursue his convictions and thatf
he seek his objectives through our democrati
processes. For him to do less is to ignore his._1"‘e-"5
sponsibilities. We insist only that he speak ands
act with regard to the law of the land, the reg"-
ulations of the University, and the rights of his-."
fellow men.” ;

By BILL SACKS ' ‘

Standout hitters are rare in collegiate baseball, and the '
pitcher often becomes the key to a successful team. It’s
probable this year's team will face a similar situation.

The loss of outﬁelder Fred Mazurek has put pressure‘
on Dave Blyshak, the only returning letterman on the pitch-
ing staff. “Last year Freddy carried us through the ﬁrst
ten games until the others started hitting,” said Blyshak.

“Even with him the team just
couldn’t score runs when they
were needed. This year we prob-
ably won’t have any long ball
hitters.”

Blyshak had a 3-4 record last

season, including a 1-0 loss to

West Virginia and .a 2-0 setback
against Syracuse. He has good
control, relying mainly on his
curve and fast ball.

In addition to Blyshak, Lee
Brueckel will also be ‘a starter.
That leaves four openings, and
coach Bob Lewis has brought in
several pitchers on scholarships
this year. “I haven’t been paying
much ‘attention to them,” said
Blyshak.

“I’ve been concentrating on
loosening up my arm. Most of
the guys will probably come
through, but you can't tell till
you get outside. In our ﬁrst week,
we usually play some service
teams and that will give coach
Lewis a /chance to experiment
with the staff,” he said.

If the pitching staff does run
into trouble, Lewis might use

second baseman Steve Eiseman.‘

Eiseman pitched some last year
and was a pitcher in high school.
“First, I'll be playing second
base, ’ said Eiseman. “If some of
the pitchers don't pan out, the

might run short,” continued Eise-
man. “My stuff’s still good and
I’m not worried about my con-
trol. But I’m still a second base-
man.”
