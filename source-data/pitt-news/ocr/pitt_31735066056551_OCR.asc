Student apathy
apparent once
again at SGB

election forum

By Sam Gresock

Staff Writer

The more things change, the more they stay the
same.-

Last night, Student Government Board tried a

new format for its student organizations meeting.
Unlike the panel-type discussion of past meetings,
this one was set up as a more informal, conversa-
tional event so students “could get a one-on—one
feeling with’the candidates,” according to SGB
Elections Chair- Deborah Ryan.
--However, less than 20 students went one-on-
one with the candidates, a fact that did not sit well
with several SGB members and candidates,
including Ryan.

“I’m really disappointed in this  I thought
morestudents would be here,” Ryan said. “I was
really hoping the turnout would’ve been higher.”

SGB presidential candidate Tony Moody said he
was also disappointed with the turnout, but the

lack of attendance was similar to what he has

seen at other events.

“I thought this was an excellent opportunity to
interact with the candidates, but I really wasn’t
surprised at how many people were here,” Moody
said. “Over the last year  the turnout at events
like this, such as open forums and safety semi-
nars, has been relatively unimpressive.”

“We just can’t grab students by the hand and
say you have to get involved,” Moody added.

According to Ryan, only 10 to 15 students
showed upqto express their concerns and ask the
candidates questions. She said the program’s
informal setting would have worked well had
more people attended the event.

“If more students would have shown up, they
could have asked [the candidates] anything they
wanted,” Ryan said. “It is a shame that more stu-
dents 'didn’t come.”

Ryan said posters announcing the event were
l_1_ung and letters were sent inviting student orga-
nizations to attend, but she said she wasn’t sure if
the organizations actually got those letters.

Board candidates Deena Buchanan and Todd
Neufeld said it is difficult to receive student input
when not many students seem to care about
expressing their opinions.

“One thing everyone seems to be trying to ﬁght
is student apathy, and with a turnout like this, it
looks like we’ll have to go door to door to get stu-
dents involved,” Buchanan said.

“It’s like the rest of the country,” Neufeld said.
“People think, ‘I’m not going to go after the infor-

Pitt joins in national study tocombat diseases affecting women

By Steve Kozlarovichy
Asst. News Editor

Pitt’s Graduate School of Public Health
and 15 other clinical centers coast-to-
coast have joined forces in a nationwide
recruitmentwfor a study to combat chron-
ic diseases affecting women.

“This is the largest study ever to seek
"answers to important questions about
women’s health,” said Janet Bork,

recruitment coordinator for Pitt’s

Department of Epidemiology. “This
study will provide answers to burning
questions regarding disability in
women.”

Recruiting women between the ages of
50 and 79 and post—menopausal is the
first phase of" the National Institutes of
Health’s (NIH) Women’s Health Initiative
(WHI) clinical trials.

WHI will focus on the causes and pre-
vention of the most common causes of
death and disability — cardiovascular

disease, cancer and osteoporosis. WHI is

a $625 million, 15-year program dedicat-

ed to studying these chronic diseases of
women. A

According to Bork, Pitt competed with
institutions across the country to become
one of the original, or Vanguard Clinical
Centers, involved in the program.

The original 16 institutions will begin
“showing the way” now with 29 more
centers being added by September 1994.

Nationally, 63,000 women will be

involved in the clinical trials study and
another 100,000 will participate in an
observational study.

Each woman will be involved for
approximately nine years to obtain the
necessary information to achieve the
goals for the study, according to the
UPMC News Bureau.

Pitt is searching for 1,400 local women

for the clinical study“ and over 42,000

women for the observation study,

Allegations of election violations inconsequential!

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

No action will be taken on
allegations of Student
Government Board candidate
misconduct, according to SGB
Elections Chair Deborah Ryan.
‘“We are looking into viola-
tions as far as postering around
campus, but at this point, no
specific rule of the SGB elec-
tions code has been broken,”
Ryan said.

The issue, raised by other
SGB candidates, concerns pos-
sible violations of the election
code by the “Make the Choice
for Equal Voice” slate which
includes Ross Pasquale as presi-
dential candidate and Julie

Crowell, Eric McKinley and

Andy Wuertele as board candi-
dates.

Some members of the slate
have campaigned individually,

' which, according to Ryan, is

legal under the elections code.
But according to board candi-
date Heath Golden, at a candi-
date orientation meeting last
month, Ryan instructed candi-

dates not to advertise as both
slates and individuals, known as
“informal slating.”

Golden, who is running on
the Golden-Mania slate with
Elizabeth Mania, said they were
approached by several presi-
dential candidates about joining
their slate but turned them
down due to Ryan’s original
comments about informal
slates.

“We were told absolutely no
informal slating would be per-
mitted,” Mania said. “When we
considered running with a pres-
idential candidate, the rule cer-
tainly had an effect.”

Ryan said she did advise the
candidates against running as a
formal slate, but said the elec-
tions code ofﬁcially reads candi-
dates “may” run together if they
are a slate.

“We researched it carefully
before we ran,” Crowell said. “I
made sure I had a choice about
advertising.”

Jacob Brody, current presi-
dent of the SGB, said there was
possibly a violation of the poli-
cy as explained to the candi-

dates, but no violation accord-

‘ing to the elections code.

“We must rely on the formal
code for judgements such as
this,” Brody said.

According to SGB member
Joe Foner, $155 can be spent on
campaign items by each candi-
date running in a slate, whereas
the limit for individuals is $200.

“The fact that slates should
advertise and include all mem-
bers counterbalances the larger
pool of money which slates
have,” Foner said.

Brody said “somewhat” of an
advantage exists for slates who
also advertise as individuals.
According to Brody, students
may‘ take notice of an individ-
ual’s name more easily than
remembering several names on
a slate.

McKinley said he sees no
problem with the way the
sIate’s advertisingis being han-
dled.“Whenever we make a
presentation, we do it as a
group or we make sure the
entire group is represented,”
McKinley said. “As for advertis-
ing, we can only go by the

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Tuesday, November ;9, "-1,993

codes we were given, and we
have not violated them.”

Pasquale said in the fall of
1990, the last time a slate was
involved with SGB election,
slate members advertised indi-
vidually and as a group.

“It is important for-students to
realize they can vote for anyone
they want,” Pasquale said.
“They don’t necessarily have to
vote for the entire slate.”

Doug Herman, a presidential
candidate who heads the
Students United for Responsible

Government (SURG) slate said '

his slate has advertised together
all along, but the issue is
insignificant.“I don’t see any
advantages or disadvantages to
informal slating,” Herman said.
“We” give a more unified

approach by laying out propos— ‘

als as a slate, but it is important
to remember students will be
voting for individuals.”

“It was a case of miscommu-
nication,” Golden said. “There
were things that could have
helped us that we didn’t do
because of our understanding
of the campaign rules.” _

donates
money to

By Michael

For The Pitt News

Phi Kappa Theta frater-
nity said it is hoping to
raise money for The
Pittsburgh Zoo in their
first annual philanthropy
— Miles of Pennies.

“A couple of the
brothers were at the
[Pittsburgh] Zoo last year
and we saw that they

were trying to raise
money for the new
Children’s Zoo and

Educational Center,” said
Chuck Whisman, chapter
president.

“We know that college
kids don’t have a lot of
money to give to charities,
but whatever spare
change they can give is
appreciated,” said Bill
Holtz, who is the Miles of
Pennies chair.’ _ ’  

According to Holtz, the
theme in Miles of Pennies
is the amount‘ of pennies
that make a mile. _“Our
goal is to get two miles
which is equal to $1,689,”
said Holtz.

lecting money three dif-

ourselves more responsible to
the African-Americans of
Pittsburgh,” Ellis Clifton said.
Clifton serves as director of the
Business and Economics Career
program for the Urban League
of Pittsburgh}

“We need to know what
[African-Americans] feel,” he
said. “We need to know what
direction you feel the civil rights
movement should take.”

Though the Urban League has
a smaller membership than the
National Association for the
Advancement of Colored
People, the Urban League is
“the largest professional organi-
zation in the country whose pri-

mary purpose is to advance the
economic and social conditions
of African-Americans,” accord-
ing to Haley.

The Urban League representa-
tives took questions from the
audience pertaining to social
issues of concern to African-
Americans and the programs of
the Urban League.

According to Haley, one of
the Urban League’s programs
strives to educate school chil-
dren about business, ‘entrepre-
neurship, and the American
economic system.

The children of today are “the
next generation of African-
American corporate executives,
or even better, the next wave of

African-American entrepre-
neurs,” Haley said.

“We’re committed to the future
of our youth,” Clifton said.

Other programs include assis-
tance for African-Americans in
college and tutoring programs
in the Northview Heights hous-
ing project.

Haley said that in this peer
tutoring program, honor stu-
dents are paid a small stipend to
tutor other students who are
struggling in school before they
can fall behind.

Fostering academic success at
a young age tends to reduce
high school dropout rates,
according to Haley. ,

“When a person is 16 or 17

years old, it’s too late,” Haley
said. “Early intervention...tries to
forestall the dropout.”

The Urban League tries to
assist African-American high
school students who have
dropped out of school, through
“school—to—work transition pro-
grams,” or by helping them
return to school.

“When they are in the
right...we are successful in get-
ting those young people back
into school,” he said.

He said the Urban League does
not have the resources, howev-
er, to eliminate the educational
problems which plague the
African-American community.

Sororities on campus are also
helping out with donations by
going around with cans to col-

The fratemity also plans to go
around to allthe residence halls
and collect money door-to-
doon
_. “We really appreciate the
help of the sororities in this
endeavor to raise money,” said
Whisman.

The fact that they are taking
out the time in their schedules

to help should not go unno-
ticed," W'hisman said.

Donating money is not the
only way in which students and
faculty can help.

There are also Adopt-An-

Prices for Adopt—An-Animal

small as a Horseshoe Crab to

“What we do pales into
insigniﬁcance in comparison to
the overall problems,” Haley
said.

He responded to one audience
member whd was concerned
about the availability of instruc-
tion in African history in
Pittsburgh public schools.

Haley said the African-
American community must go
“one step further” than the pub-
lic schools to proliferate the her-
itage of the African nation to its
youth.

He cited that the Jewish com-
munity recently observed
Kristalnacht, the beginning of
the Holocaust.

“The Jewish community does

not rely on Allderdice, or
Peabody, or Brashear,” he said.
“It probably wasn’t even men-
tioned in public schools, yet
every Jewish kid knows about
it.”

“I don’t think we should ever
trust the teaching of our history
to public schools. \Ve’ve got to
depend on ourselves to do it.”

Single Point of Contact, or
SPOC, is a program designed to
help young single mothers
“remove the excuses that keep
them from going to school and
learning,” according to Leroy
Hicks. T

The program offers daycare
and classroom training in a sin-
gle locations so the mother can
learn while her child or children

are attended to.

Another program for single
parents, now in its fourth year,
is the Entrepreneur Training
Program.

According to Haley, single
parents are trained to operate
“microbusinesses” out of their
homes, or small shops.

Haley said currently 25 such
businesses are operating suc-
cessfully as a result of the pro-
gram.

He said much of the violence
which affects the African-
American community is a result
of the “degeneration of the
African-American family,” citing
the fact that 67% of African-
American children grow up in
single parent homes.

“The seed and the kernel” of

the Urban League and the.

NAACP was planted “the very
day the first African was forced
to come [to America] on a ship
against his will,” Haley said.
The “first flowering of the
search for freedom” for African-
Amercans ‘came during the
Reconstruction era after the
Civil War, he said.
“African-Americans were free
by law, but not by circum-
stance, because economic,
social, and political conditions
were unfavorable for the
African-American community.”
A lynching in Illinois in 1910
was the direct root of the
NAACP, which fought for politi-
cal equality, but not social

issues, whereas the Urban
League was founded to address
social concerns of African-
Americans, Haley said.

Pittsburgh, like many other
large industrial cities of the early
twentieth century, “was a place
of hope for many African-
Americans coming from the
South,” he said.

Unable to obtain housing,
many African-American workers
were forced to live in railroad
boxcars, without proper sanita-
tion, in conditions “unfit for
human habitation,” Haley said.

According to Haley, the Urban
League of Pittsburgh "originated
in the Hill District, before
expanding to encompass the
entire city.

“You keep hearing about a lot of inter-
est in this campaign,” Scerbo said. “If
people were really that interested, they
should have come here to take a look.”

Pitt junior Kendra Thomas said she
attended the event in search of candi-
dates with realistic platforms.

“I’m looking for candidates who have

‘ ideas and goals which are attainable,”

Thomas said. “The candidates have a lot
of good ideas. Let’s see if they can follow
through with them.” -

“You can dance around a subject all

you want,” she added. “It depends on
whether or not you do something about
it.”

Moira Meadows, who said she, “didn’t
really come to represent any particular
group,” also said she hopes the candi-
dates set attainable goals for themselves

and the board.

“I’d like to see candidates with realistic
expectations of what SGB can do. That’s
the bottom line,” Meadows said. “I’ve
heard about a lot of outrageous expecta-
tions. SGB is powerful, but they can’t do

. everything.”

Students Chris Meier and Adam
Shapiro said candidates with SGB expe-
rience will be able to see what issues
they can directly affect.

“We need someone who’s been
involved and knows what goes on,”

Shapiro said. “A lot of [Candidates] are

talking about hiring more police officers.-

That’s out of their control.”

Meier said, “These guys can search
until they’re blue in the face for concerns
but they've got to be realistic.”

Student Nova Ackerman said leader-
ship capabilities are important when
choosing student government members.
“I’m looking for someone with experi-
ence and someone who will be success-
ful in getting others motivated to achieve
their goals,” she said.

Craig Collins of College Republicans
said the candidates he spoke with
answered his questions about the pro-
posed Black Cultural Center and the
Women’s Studies major program, but he
did not like the informal style of the
meeting.

“Personally, I was very disappointed
that the format changed  it was disor-
ganized,” Collins said. “It made it hard to
get-all the candidates to understand what
you were asking.”

Scerbo also said the program could
have benefitted had it been organized
better. “I think if it were a little more
structured, if groups had been contacted

better, and if there was some semblance _
of order, it could have been more bene-

ficial for students,” Scerbo said.

“This informal setting is a good way to
see how candidates will react to ques-
tions when there’s nothing in front of
them,” he added. “Here you have to be
able to think on your toes, and that’s
important for board members or presi-

dents who have to make snap deci-

sions.”

Blind justice
Recently, the policy of mandatory sentencing for
drug—related offenses has come under scrutiny.
According to the ‘New Yorle Times, the United States
Sentencing Commission reports that, “more than 5,000
drug offenders who were not involved in violence and
had no previous record were sent to federal prisons for
terms of at least five years.” The sentences generally
depend on the kind of drug, not the amount the

offender possesses. The mandatory sentencing law was _

imposed in the 1980’s. Now, according to the New Yorle
Times, federal officials list this as one of the main rea-
son for prison overcrowding.

It is now time to revise these laws and lift the manda-
tory sentences so that those who have made a mistake
can be rehabilitated. California Judge J. Lawrence Irving

was quoted as saying, “You’ve got murderers who get

out sooner than some kid who did some stupid thing
with drugs,”_ (New Yorle Times).
Judge Irving is not the only member of the Justice

department who thinks it is time to change the way we _

deal with drug offenses. When she spoke here in
October, Attorney General Janet Reno stressed the need
to re—examine the sentencing for narcotics offenses.
According to Reno, up 50 percent of the current prison
population are arrested for these crimes. '

Instead of warehousing these people, Reno said the
Justice system should work to make them into produc-
tive members of society through education and sub-
stance abuse programs. She was talking about addicts
and dealers, but it is also first— time offenders who are
receiving these sentences. 2

While these people should receive somevsort of
penalty for their crime, the punishment’ should fit the
crime. The U.S. cannot afford to hold these people for
unreasonably long times for petty offenses. The U.S.
should begin implementing the programs which have
already been shown to be successful, such as boot
camps and job training. There are also other forms of
imprisonment, such» as house arrest and the tether pro-
gram, in which a criminal is monitored by means of an
electronic band attached to his body.

The New York: Times also cites a case in which two
men received equal sentences for two very different
drug offenses. One man was engaged by an undercov-
er agent to find a dealer who could supply LSD to the
agent. The other man was found in possession of
20,000 doses of LSD. _

By crowding the prisons with these offenders, it
becomes difficult to make the sentences mean any-
thing. By using alternate forms of punishment, the U‘.S.
can make use of a human‘ resource while solving the
crime problem. By removing truly dangerous criminals
from society and keeping borderline people on the
right path, the Justice system will go a long way toward
making the streets safer for everyone.

Constitution has no time constraint

1 do belive that America has
indeed sadly fallen from the
ideals upon which it was
founded. .

But, I find great fault with
the logical path that David W.
Matta pursues in his argument
against the validity of the U.S.
Constitution (The Pitt News,
Nov. 3).

I realize that in disagreeing
with Mr. Matta, I am, as he
made quite clear, both wrong
and stupid, yet I feel com-
pelled to do so despite such
alarming consequences.

I begin by questioning Mr.
Matta’s ideas about the
American Constitution which
he finds to be obsolete. I, on
the other hand find it to be the
greatest document ever con-
ceived.

Quite‘ ironically, it_ is the
timelessness of the Constitution
that leads me to this conclu-
sion.

In over 200 years of exis-
tence, the Constitution has
been amended only 27 times.
Of those 27, the first ten are
the Bill of Rights, which were
just after ‘the
Constitution was completed
only to persuade a few reluc-
tant states, most notably Rhode
Island and North Carolina, to
join the union.

Thus, in a practical sense,
the Bill of Rights may be con-
sidered part of the original
Constitution. A

Moreover, amendment 18 is
concerned with Prohibition and
amendment 21 deals with the
repeal of 18. Because we real-
ized just a little too late that
this issue was not a constitu-
tional one, we showed that the
founding fathers were a bit
more wise.

After more than two cen-
turies, then, there has only
been the need to consider a
mere fifteen changes.

Fifteen! And some of those
changes, like the 22nd amend-
ment, (which limits the
President to only two terms in
office) were" the result of parti-

san politics; we may have been
better off without them. But
that is a separate argument
altogether.

The point I'm making is that
there has really been only a
minimal need to force the
Constitution to adapt to chang-
ing times.

At its founding, the United
States was the great experi-
ment.

' Never before had a nation

Neil
Chaudhuri

built upon the principles of
democracy been conceived. In
order to make this unprece-

dented experiment into an

enduring reality, the nation
needed a body of laws that
would get it off the ground in
the short term and thrive in the

long term.
The 55 delegates at the
Constitutional Convention

meticulously worded the text
of the document to allow for
differing interpretations and
hence enable the text to grow
with the country.

These individuals, despite
the inane and insulting way
that Mr. Matta characterizes
them, were brilliant enough to
understand that the greatest
and most withstanding ideas
ensue from intelligent and
organized debate.

This is a notion that has no
time constraint.

Of course there will always
be disagreement over whether
or not something is lawful,
and the Constitution provides
the freedom for Americans of
any era to come to some con-
clusion after a healthy dis-
course.

This is why the Constitution
is relevant now and will remain
relevant for as long as any
American is left to defend its

ideals.

As I began to grow more and
more annoyed reading Mr.
Matta’s lofty and seemingly
unfounded constitutional rumi-
nations, I was taken by sur-
prise.

Suddenly, out of nowhere,
he raises the issue of guns’con-
trol and violence. While I find
his comments rather sopho-
moric, I can understand his dis-
enchantment.

Yet I do notadvocate tossing“
the second amendment (which
guarantees the right to bear
arms) right out the window,
either. ,

As guns have no mind of
their own, perhaps we should
consider the people who oper-
ate them. -

Despite my being wrong and
stupid, why is it that after
watching a Rambo movie, or
any other showcase for gun
violence, I never feel the urge
to fire 60 rounds of ammo at
everyone eating dinner in the
Schenley Cafe?

I think I already know the
reason why this is, but maybe
Mr. Matta needs to muse over
the answer while he gazes at
the stars above from the “gaze-

bo on the William Pitt Union -

lawn.”.

The magnificent document I

that is the United States
Constitution is what defines the

tremendous success of our »

own great experiment and has
served as the blueprint for the
constitutions of numerous
other nations I scattered
throughout the world. _

Now these countries may
enjoy the same freedom and
democracy that we do. How

one could so callously disre- «

gard such a masterpiece is well
beyond me.

Then again, the effort I have
put forth here, as was the case
with the constitutional dele-
gates, has been made without
the luxury of Old Spice. You
see, I use Brut.

more in the biological sciences

516 yards of total offense for

138 yards for

A 35-7 score and another loss
to a nationally ranked oppo-
nent.

Why? -

Yesterday at the weekly press
conference, Pitt head coach
johnny Majors clearly addressed
an area. that his team needs to
improve. It is an element of
football that can’t be taught and
something that most nationally
ranked teams possess.

“We \need speed at every
position,” Majors said.

This statement comes after

the Pitt

lightning—quick Miami squad
Saturday. - ’
Pitt managed to gain only 19
yards on the ground, and a fero-
cious’Hurricane pass rush regis-
tered nine sacks.
Miami has ‘the top defense in

._ p the Big East‘ and is one of the

quickest teams in the country.
.“We have not played a team
with better speed,” Majors said.
Center Lawson Mollica said
that, “he has never faced a team
as fast as Miami.”
- “They had very quick defen-
sive linemen that gave us some

-problems,” he said.

That quickness is something
that Majors is striving for.

“We need help everywhere,”
he said.

The Panthers have been hurt
by a lot of teams this year but
Majors remains upbeat.

said. “I think we have a chance
to have a good recruiting year.”

“I think recruits can see that
they can come here and help
us,” he said. “There is not a

don’t need help.”

The Pitt Panthers didn’t real-
ly have a chance Saturday
against the Miami Hurricanes.
Sure, there’s something to be
said for the ole David-vs.-
Goliath attitude, but there is a
lot more to be said for nation-
al-powerhouse football.

It was a game that you could
see Pitt getting rolled over by

Saturday that only the handful

Finnish ﬂash Sami Vartiainen finds refuge in Trees pool

Byjeff Kamis
Staff Writer

hen many of us are

- deciding where we

want to go to school,

the distance from

our homes may play a part. Or

we may have visited a school
that we really liked.

But seldom do we just pack
up our things and head _to an
unknown place, like a foreign
country that we have never
even visited.

Sami Vartiainen is certainly
not one of the many. Vartiainen,
who is in his second season
with the Pitt men’s swimming
and diving team, left his home-
land of Finland one day after his
20th birthday last December.

His destination: Tampa,
Florida, the United States of
America.

Vartiainen was meeting his
new coach and new teammates
for the team’s training trip over
winter break. _

“It was really scary coming
Qyer sitting on the airplane,”

Vartiainen said. “But the team

took me in real well, and it

didn’t take that long to get
adjusted.”

Head coach Chuck Knoles
said that he agreed, despite the
fact that Sami had never even
visited the United

a way it  ‘

Vartiainen said that the time
in the army and the past year
with Knoles has really motivat-
ed him.

Sami very well, and

weekends ago,

“Sami brings a lot to the team,
but one thing he brings‘ is a
maturity that has helped the
team out of the pool.”

Vartiainen may have matured‘

during his 11-month mandatory
service with the Finnish Army
immediately following his high
school graduation.

“You have to have a sense of
humor because it’s tough men-
tally,” Vartiainen said. 

“You have to take a lot of

new ideas, and he’s done a lot
with my strength,” Vartiainen
said.
“Chuck doesn’t give in, I like
it because he gets me going.”
Knoles said that Vartiainen’s
dedication is second to none on

the team, and it is reflected in,

the nickname that his team-

‘mates have given him: “Sarge.”

“I think it’s sort of a nickname
of respect for him,” Knoles said.

and there was a lot of competi-
tion when he first got here.”

Knoles said that the recruiting
process with Vartianinen was an
unusual one for him.

“I heard about him through
some Finnish friends that I
know. They gave me a list, and
he was one of the people on the
list,” Knoles said.

“I received an info packet on
him and converted his times
and they were fairly decent,’.’
said Knoles.

“I said this kid’s big and
bright, and I need to get him.”

Knoles then began talking to
Vartiainen back and forth over
the phone, finding out that he
was interested in coming to Pitt.

“It was a long, hard recruiting
process over the phone, with
him never having seen Pitt and
me never having ever seen him
swim,” Knoles said.

Vartiainen said that he
became interested in coming to
the U.S. while he was in the
army.

“We had this guy from the
recruiting agency talking to us
and I got interested,” Vartiainen
said. “So I tried and I got some
responses.”

Vartiainen said that he was
contacted by about 10 schools,
but Syracuse was the only other
Big East school, Despite his
unfamiliarity with the country,
he said it was not a big shock
coming over. ‘

“Coming to the States was to
combine swimming with educa-
tion and get experience for life,”
Vartiainen said. “It’s not that
different.”

The one major difference may
just be the weather. Vartiainen
said that the coldest day in
Pittsburgh would not even
come close to the coldest day in
his homeland. ‘

He added one other differ-
ence:

“You can’t get shot in Finland
in the middle of the street; that’s
the scary part here,” Vartiainen
said.

But Knoles said that
Vartiainen has become an
excellent role model for some
of his younger swimmers in a
short time.

“When younger kids want to
emulate someone like Sami, it

On‘ Saturday afternoon, the much
improved Pitt Panthers faced the Miami

‘-Hurricanes in what many envisioned

would be a very lopsided contest.

" ‘The Hurricanes came into the game not

only ranked fourth in the nation, but also
carrying the toughest schedule, having
onlylost to No. 1 ranked Florida St.

At the end of the contest the final score
read Miami over Pitt, 35-7, but considering
how the ‘Canes have been playing in
recent weeks, (thumbing Syracuse 49-0
and scorching Temple 42-7) you will have
to be honest with yourself and say Pitt
played their hearts out.

“You’ve got to give Pittsburgh credit,”
Miami head coach Dennis Erickson said.
“They played hard. That’s one thing we
noticed, that they never gave up. That is

one thing that they improved on since the ’

beginning of the season.

“Pitt is starting to play defense [better],
and they are starting to do the things offen-
sively that coach Majors wants them to do.
The progress that they are making is
extremely good for the program, and in

' another year or two they are going to be

rightup there where they used to be,”

. ' Erickson said.

‘While Erickson praised the Panthers for
the way they played, one of Pitt's players
walked off the field glancing at the score-
board in a state of disbelief.

“I felt confident about our game plan,”
outside linebacker Jon McCra'y ‘said. “I felt
that we did have a chance to win. If we
would have stopped the big plays on a
couple of occasions we would have been
in a better predicament. Who knows, the
outcome might have been different.”

...As the sophomore from Akron, Ohio,

untied his sneakers amidst his teammates-

in the locker room, the only thing on his
mind was optimism about bringing back
the proud tradition of Panther football to
the fans of Pittsburgh. V

“In the years to come we will be better,”
McCray said. “We will get more recruits to
push us to work harder — we are deter-
mined we will turn this program around.”

Since taking the starting outside line—_

backer spot in the Ohio St. game, McCray
has developed into a solid linebacker for
the Panthers. ’

After having six tackles against the
Hurricanes, McCray is currently ranked
second on the team with 74 tackles (39

solos, ﬁve tackles for losses), one sack, two
deflections, and one forced fumble.

“J-Mack (McCray) is very confident,”
sophomore defensive tackle Eric Johnson
said. “He is not the type to boast about his
ability. He goes out and does his job and
keeps his mouth shut. He is [a] very sup-
portive and team-oriented person. I like his
kind because he’ shows more action than
talk and he keeps busting his [butt] on the
field.”

“In a few years he will be one of the best
linebackers that we have — I’ll bet my bot-

" tom dollar on that,” said Johnson. _

Not bad for a person whose future as a
Panther seemed bleak last semester.

Last spring McCray accompanied former
Pitt defensive tackle Sean Gilbert and cur-
rent teammate Reuben Brown on a night
on the town. .

The three were later arrested at the

Original Hot Dog Shop on misdemeanor

and felony assault charges.

Due to their ‘arrest,-McCray and Brown
were suspended from the team and kept

they are going nowhere.
_..The desire is there.
The talent will come.

- -The difference in talent
between the powerhouse Miami
and theorebuilding Pitt was
clearly evident by looking at just
one factor: team speed. The
Hurricanes were consistently
faster and quicker than the
Pantherslat every position and

made Pitt pay on nearly every

play.

“Everybody knows their
defense has unbelievable
speed, every position has great
speed, the coaches drilled to
run north-south,” Pitt quarter-
back John Ryan said. “Martin

~could outrun them, but their
linebackers are quick.”

“They weren’t as strong as
they were fast,” Pitt offensive
lineman Ruben Brown said. ‘

Offensively, Miami ran quick

slant—ins and out-patterns that 9

the Pitt defensive backs and
linebackers could just not react
to in time, and Bennent and
Jones got to the corner on
sweeps before anyone in Navy
Blue could.

Defensively, and especially
on specialteams, the ‘Canes
swarmed the ba_ll better than
anyone the Panthers have seen
all season. Pitt averaged only
05 yards per rush, and topped
out at 10 yards for the biggest
gainer of the day.

The Hurricane defensive line
sacked Ryan four times (while
the defense had a total of nine

sacks for 56 yards), with Kevin ‘

Patrick recording two-and—a-half
sacks on the day.
On one play, Miami’s Warren

Jim Madl/The Pitt News

Tom Tumulty and the Panther defense has steadily improved during tlliel season.

Sapp blew past Pitt lineman

Dave Kristoﬁc so fast that by the
time Kristofic looked up, Sapp
was already dancing over a fall-
en Ryan forothe smattering of
Miami fans in the stands.

Miami is consistently one of
the fastest teams in the country,
so the comparison might be a
little unfair, but if Pitt is to
improve, they need to recruit
some burners that can, if not
balance out squads like Miami,

at least make up the difference.

Pitt finished 3 of 14.

Playing out of the defensive
end spot, Reardon got a hand
onvFrank Collins’ pass, swatting
it into the air. He maneuvered
under the ball, picked it out of
the air, and rumbled to the one-
yard line before being dragged
down. ,

“It was a play-action, and I
play basketball so I jumped up
like it was a rebound,” Reardon
said. “Everyone hounded me to
go the three or four inches for
the touchdown.”

That’s how I heard Mel

“I was

Vartiainen said.“I want to

Vartiainen is currently
