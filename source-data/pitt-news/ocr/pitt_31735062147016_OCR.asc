Beta Group Topples Alpha
Power At Cp_u_ncil Meeting

Fraternity Heads Deposed '

 

As Majority Coalition
Assumes Control

 

By Charles B. Holstein _ ,

The applecart of Alpha_coalition’s

olitical control of the Pitt camplls
was unceremoniously d_ump_ed Tuesday
night for the second time in two con-
secutive days. Immediately Iollowing
,Alpha’s failure to seat a maJ01'1l3Y
Monday in the new Student-Faculty
assembly, Beta coalition, by means of
a “coup d’etat” wrapped in a mo-
tion by Elmer Hubacher,_E35, Theta
Chi president, succeeded in_ removing
from office in Interfraternity council
all four Alpha officers, and inducting
in their stead four members of Beta
coalition. ,

Clifton McClain, C35, Sigma Chi
president, King Derr, C35. Slgma 
-pha Epsilon, George Golantya BA-33,
Sigma Alpha Mu president, and Her-
bert Kweskin, D37, Phi _EDS110n_P1
president, are now president, vice-
president, secretary, and i3_1'€3-S_u1‘€1‘, 1'9-
spectively, of the organization, suc-
ceeding Robert Willison, BA35, Delta
Tau Delta, Joseph L. Rodgers, C36,
Phi Kappa, Earl Israel, C35. P1 Lamb:
da Phi, and Robert Bowdler, C36, Phl
Gamma Delta.

The removal proceedings were the
culmination of a month-old ﬁght in
Council rising out of the election of
the four Alpha men to ofﬁce under
alleged “irregular” practices. Alpha
coalition, composed of six of the thir-
teen campus social fraternities, was
successful in staving off the removal
proceedings sponsored by the new
gnajcnity-control Beta camp at a spe-
cial meeting of Council about two
weeks ago by calling a surprise ad-
journment, after Derr, Beta spokes-
man and legal expert, had woven_ a
network of legislative measures which
made it possible according to Council
by-laws for officers to be removed by
a straight majority vote.

The Alpha oﬂicers were swept out
of ofﬁce by a 7-6 vote Tuesday shortly
after Bernard Silverblatt, C34, former
Pi Lambda Phi representatives, had de-
clared to Beta, “You can’t depose our
oﬂicers!” ..   p. ..   .. 

Prior to the vacating of the offices,
Alpha had deplored the stand, of the
Beta forces and took the position that
its men, though feeling they were
forced to do nothing, had decided to
compromise “for the best interests of
Council,” and offered two positions
on the executive committee to Beta.
Beta replied that it was willing to
compromise also, and would accept
only two of the four ofiices, but that
it must be awarded the presidency.
Alpha refused this demand, and the
removal proceedings were then under-
taken.

The meeting opened, after a de-
cidedly friendly dinner atmosphere at
the Theta Chi house, when Derr rose
to protest against Willison’s action
in adjourning the previous meeting,
declaring that the chair had “exceed-
ed its authority” and had acted un-
gentlemanly and contrary to the estab-
lished rules of order. Willison replied
that the situation was, at the time,
“controversial, to say the least,” with
both factions believing explicitly in
their own righteousness. He remind-
ed Derr of the arbitration conferences
arranged before the" last meeting
ended.

At this point, Hubacher, an off-
spring of the old South with a drawl
from here to Georgia, declared, “You-
all pulled a fast one on us. Okay,
all well and good. We, at present,
have a majority vote in council and
we intend to exercise it. You-all have
pledged your intention of abiding by

Coeds Turn Gardeners
And Gardens Bloom
At Heinz House

It’s the sophomore gardens
again. And this time, as pre-
dicted way back in the snowings
and blowings of January, the
gardens are blooming brightly
as the poets would have it.

If by chance you’ve missed this ‘
ﬂoral display, glance upward to-
ward the left hand corner of the
lawn below Heinz House. That
bright ginghamy patch of white
and yellow beneath the YW
windows is the sophomore garden.
There grow in abundance tulips,
bright yellow tulips, some almost
orange, white tulips that the
gardeners point out with pride
as being “double.”

The crocus crop which sprung
over night. on the hillside wasn’t
exactly what one might call an
example of ﬂoral artistry. Such
derogatory remarks as “over-
grown dandelions” and “scraps of
yellow paper” seemed to be the
consensus of opinion upon the
first evidence of the sophomore’s
project. But with the sudden
bhoming of the tulip bed the
sophomore gardens achieve the
distinction of success. Roberta
Nern heads the list of planters

with such valuable “aids” as
Margaret Lewis, Sarah Blair,
Nelda Vveiterhausen, Ruth De

Forest, Virginia Long and Norma
Cosgrove.

Orchids Go To Three
Faculty Members
For Service

With the bright and sunny weather
three new orchid wearers blossom
out on the campus. The orchids given
by the Pitt News for distinguished
service above the line of regular duty
go this time to:

Dr. Frank D. Tyson, professor of
economics, because to date he leads
all contestants, faculty and other-
wise, for the honor of enlisting the
greatest number of workers in the
campaign organization, and because
he is spreading the news of the “Com-
plete the Cathedral” wherever he
goes.

L. C. McCandless, head of the de-
partment of civil engineering, because
he is organizer and chairman of the
faculty committee, which is rendering
brilliant service in the building of
the roster of the campaign workers.

J, E. McLean, assistant business
manager, because on him falls much
of the load of physical arrangements
involved in operating a big fund
raising activity in an incompleted
building, bringing hundreds of people
to see the structure, so that visitors
do not see the “wheels go round” or
have to realize that the additional
activity does produce a strain on the
administrative group.

New Assemblymen
Await First Meet

Total Of 1,141 Voters Participate
In Election Last Monday

Whatever storm was brewing in
campus politics during the early part
of the week has now abated, and
elected assembly members are await-
ing the call for their ﬁrst meeting.

A total of 1,141 students voted for
the-assembly candidates, while 580
took part in the balloting for College
association ofﬁces. Despite the inter-
est evidenced before election day, all
predictions of the total vote were at
least 500 over the actual couiit_ More
students took part in the 1933 affair
than in this year’s.

The ﬁrst work of the new Student-
Faculty association will concern itself
with the-election of an executive com-
mittee. Five student members are to
be chosen to this body. Working with
the Chancellor, the dean of men,
and the dean of women, the under-
graduate committeemen will, accord-
ing to the constitution, “have power
customarily given to such a com-
mittee.”

Schools now represented in the as-
sociation include the College and the
schools of Business Administration,
Dentistry, Engineering, Mines and
Education. Other schools in the Uni-
versity, by a majority vote of their
students, may also enter the new
group at any time.

Group To Discuss
War Psychology

Psychology Professor To Lead
Student Meeting Monday

After debating the overt causes of
war in several meetings, the Student
Discussion group will meet this Mon-
day in Room 315, Alumni hall, to dis-
cuss under the leadership of Dr. Nor-
man L. Munn, assistant professor in
the psychology department, “The
Psychology of War.”

Dr. Munn will not speak at the
session but will direct the discussion
of the students. These social phases
of man’s nature: whether he is
naturally pugnacious, the extent of
the inﬂuence of war propaganda, and
racial prejudices of groups of people
will be among the questions to ‘be
debated at the session. '

At previous meetings, the machina-
tions of capitalists and the intrigue
of nations and armament manufac-
turers were discussed. Dr. B. J. Hovde,
professor of history, directed the
sessions.

600 Attend Pitt News
Style Show; 6 Win
Door Prizes

From beach to ballroom! That
was the range of women’s and
men’s fashions in the News Spring
and Summer Style show in the
Hotel Schenley Wednesday after-
noon. More than 600 students
attended and danced after the
modeling to the music of Al
Wasel’s Intercollegiate orchestra.

A three-piece red and white
ensemble, including shorts, blouse
and a skirt, which could also be
used as a cape, was displayed
for tennis. One of the most prom-
inent frocks in the display was a
colorful Mexican dress. Tur-
quoise knit was displayed for Sun-
day evening wear, and taffeta
and net were shown for formal
wear.

The new deal in men’s clothes
was adequately exempliﬁed by
blue, tan, brown and gray knee
action suits with patch pockets.
The greatest sensation in the
men’s ..modeling was caused‘ by
the latest riding habit display.

Four freshmen, one sophomore
and one junior were the lucky
women in the drawing of the
stockings, donated by the ‘Wise
Shoe Store, Jack Hammerschmidt,
star of the Cap and Gown show,
repeated by request the song,
“Fine Feathers.” Oscar Schloss-
berg was the accompanist.

The models were as follows:
Betty Black, Alberta Boyer, Ag-

The Works

Attributed To Shakespeare?

Followers of Bacon Employ
Mathematics As Proof
Of Authorship

By John C. Gerber

The Shakespeare-Bacon contro-
versy introduced recently in the
columns of the News, is nothing new.
It dates back to the middle of the
past century and is a phenomenon al-
most wholly American. ~

A Miss Delia Bacon, writing in Put-
nam’s, 1856, started the entire affair.
In her article, Miss Bacon bewailed
the “stupendous spectacle of a nation
referring the origin of its drama —- a
drama more noble and learned than
the Greel-:—to the invention—-the ac-
cidental unconscious invention—of a
stupid, ignorant, illiterate, third-rate
play actor!” Thus she disposed of
Shakespeare, and named in his stead
as the true author of the plays Fran-
cis Bacon. Figuratively and literally,
she died for her cause. Originally a
resident of Cincinnati, Miss Bacon
ﬁrst came to literary notice as a lec-
turer on history in Boston. It was
during the course of her historical
studies that she became convinced
that Bacon wrote the works com-
monly attributed to Shakespeare. To
conﬁrm her views, she went to Eng-
land to study and to investigate. The
English laughed at her, and the ed-
itors refused her articles. Finally,
through the help of Nathaniel Haw-
thorne, who was in England for a
brief visit, she succeeded in publish-
ing a book through Fraser’s. It was
a dry, incoherent tone entitled The
Philosophy of the Plays of Shake-
speare Unfolded, which, it has been
said, only one man ever read com-,
pletely, Undismayed by the ridicule
her book aroused, Miss Bacon deter-
mined to push her investig3~ti0I1S
further; she was certain the true
facts lay hidden in the grave of Shake-
speare or of Bacon, or, possibly, of
Raleigh. Being her only conﬁdant,
Hawthorne attempted to discourage
her new plans but was passionately
cut off. Stormed by abuse, humiliated
by laughter, and believing that the
anathema of Shakespeare’s tomb had.
fallen upon her, Miss Bacon wavered,
cracked and soon died, a complete
lunatic. The “most unkindest cut of
all” was that she had been prompted
only by a desire to glorify her own
name.

The case was reopened in 1866 by
the Honorable Nathaniel Holmes,
supreme court judge of Missouri and
later professor of law at Harvard, In

championing Bacon in his The Au-I

thorship of Shakespeare, Judgel
Holmes was eminently legal. His
brief amounted to this: the author

of the plays knew law; Bacon knew
law; therefore, Bacon wrote the plays.
He was convinced, for instance, that
in order to write the grave diggers’
scene in Hamlet, the author must
have been familiar with the celebrated
case of Hales v. Petit, Plowden’s R
256. More direct proof, however, was
to be found in a postscript of a letter
written by Tobie Matthew to Francis
Bacon, in which the former said:
“The most prodigious wit which ever
I knew of my nation, and of this]
side of the sea, is of your Lordship’si
name, though he be known -by an-
other.” To those who, like Judge
Holmes, recognized the analogy be-
tween this letter and the one in the
signiﬁcant case of Bardell v. Pick-
wick, the conclusion was obvious.
“Shakespeare” was only a pen name
for Bacon_ Another of the proofs pre-
sented by Holmes was contained in
an anecdote to the effect that a man
named Hogg, once on trial, implored
Sir Nicholas Bacon (the father of
Francis) to save his life, claiming
there was a kindred between Hogg
and Bacon. “Aye,” replied Sir Nich-
olas, “you and I cannot be kindred
except you be hanged; for Hog is not
Bacon until it is hanged.” With only
a slight stretch of his fertile imag-
ination, Judge Holmes found this
same joke in “The Merry Wives of
\Vindsor: ”

Evans. “I pray you have your re-
membrance, child; accusative, hung,
hang, hog.”

Quick. “‘Hang—hog’
bacon, I warrant you.”

Finally, the “newt’s eye” and “frogs
toe” of Macbeth reminded Holmes of
Bacon’s Sylva Sylvarum; Yorick’s
skull of De Augmentis, Falstaff’s jests .
of the Essay on Truth, and Miss
Quickly of On Marriage and Single
Life!

During the following thirty years,
the Baconians kept the presses roll-
ing. Only the more notable works
can be considered. In 1883, Mrs.
Henry Potts published a book en-
titled The Promus of Formularies and
Elegancies (being private notes, circa
1594. hitherto unpublished, of Fran-
cis Bacon, Illustrated and Elucidated
by Passages from Shakespeare). In
collecting these “dusts and sweepings”
of Bacon’s writings, she found no
fewer than 4,404 passages in the
Shakespearian plays, sonnets and
poems had their origin in the frag-
mentary jottings of Bacon, which she
collected in the Promus. In Bacon’s

is Latin for

‘ forbeare .

“a ring of gold in a smyne’s mouth,”

for instance, Mrs, Potts detected
Shakespeare’s “rich jewel in an
Ethiop’s ear.” Richard Grant White
was originally asked to write an in-
troduction for this book' but' declined
and wrote a criticism instead. “Mrs.
Potts,” he remarked, “is ‘loony.’ ”

For sheer ingenuity, whatever hon-
ors there be should be heaped upon
Ignatius Donnelly, Shakespearean
scholar extraordinary, erstwhile Con-
gressman from Minnesota, and twice
nominated by the People’s party for
the vice presidency. In a book en-
titled The Great Cryptogram, 1887, Mr.
Donnelly presented some amazing dis-
coveries. (By way of introduction, he
dismissed the lunacy of Delia Bacon
with the observation that plenty of
women have been insane who thought
Shakespeare wrote the plays.) He
was convinced that the writer of the
plays had put a cipher into the Folio
of 1623. Deciphering the plays was a
matter only of simple arithmetic; for
instance:

Page 53 of the Folio x 7 italic words
on that page equals 371, The 371st
word on that page is “bacon.” Apply-
ing the same principle on the next
page, Donnelly achieved:

Page 54 x 12 italic words equals
648.

The 648th word proved to be “Nich-
olas.” In this manner, Donnelly ob-
tained:

Francis—Bacon—Nicl1olas—Bacoiis
——son.

Cheered by such success, Donnelly
continued. The ﬁrst column on page
53 was broken by the beginning of
a scene. Above the break were 189
words, below it 269, or 273, counting
the hyphenated words twice. Using
these numbers and the magic 371
procured before, he subtracted.

371-189 words above break equals
182.

371-283 words below break equals
98.

Beginning at the break and count-
ing down, Donnelly discovered the
182iid word to -be “I;” beginning at
the break and counting up, he found
the 98th word was “Francis.” In this
manner he eked out: ‘'1, Francis Ba-
con, Son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, a.
Truly Great and Good Man.” Later he
obtained: “A Gorbellied rascal——
Jack Speare.” Clues lay also in hy-
phens and brackets. By adding the
hyphenated and-~ bracketed words on
page 74, and by counting several of
them twice, Donnelly was able to
come upon the word “found.” Like-
wise, he alighted upon the word “out.”
Thus the mystery was “found out.”
These examples give only a brief»
glimpse into Donnelly’s method; his
entire system required a large book.

This new game proved to be a pop-
ular one. Inspired by Donnelly, other
ingenious persons unearthed codes
not only in the plays but in the pro-
hibition written on Shakespeare’s
grave. Using a key Bacon once had
referred to in the De Augmentis, a
Hugo Black found the innocent look-
ing “Good Friend for Jesus SAKE
.” really said, “Francis
Bacon wrote Shakespeare’s Plays—-
Shakespeare.” Gordon Clarke, who
continued the research, was able to
produce among other things:

Francis Bacon VVrote Here: Aye,
Aye, Shaxpeare.

Shaxpeare:
Bacon was he
Francis Bacon.

Bacon raised CD (seedy) William.

Since the beginning of the second
century, only sporadic outbursts have
kept Baconianism alive. Mark Twain,
for instance, branded those who would
not recognize the Baconian theory as
“Stratfordolators, Shakesperiods,ban-
galors, thugs, ‘troglodytes, herum—
frodites, blatherskites, buccaneers and
bando1eers.” Commenting on these
phrases in the Bookman, Edward
Fuller said that Twain was “not even
funny when he loses his temper.”
Fuller went on to prove by accepted
methods of the Baconians that Bacon
wrote also The Anatomy of Melan-
choly, The Broken Heart, and the
works accredited to Marlowe and
Dryden! In 1925, William Stone Booth
published Subtle Shining Secrecies
\Vrit in the Margents of Brooks. In
it he revealed new acrostics and
cryptic messages. From the syllable
“pig,” for example, in the word “pig-
mies,” Booth scented “bacon.” And
from the witch's “Padock calls anon,”
Booth took the pa, the c, and the an,
and produced “Pacan,” which he
seriously presented as a signature of
Bacon. E. L. Pearson, reviewing
Booth’s work in the Outlook, facetious-
ly suggested other possibilities. For
instance there were the plays about
the Henrys. What was more simple
than to suppose that the ﬁrst syl-
lable of Henry, or “lien,” was to sug-
gest “egg,” and “egg” of course-
“bacon!”

In their search for “a mind to match
the matter of the Plays,” many modern
decipherers have moved away from
the Baconian theory. To their satis-
faction, they can and have proved
that almost any Elizabethan writer,
except Shakespeare himself, was the
true author of the plays. Bacon, prob-
ably, stfill has the advantage, but
Marlowe is giving him stiff competi-
tion, One of the more important of
the present day decipherers is Joseph

Martin Feely of Rochester, N. Y, Mr.
Feely recently donated the Pitt Li-
brary a copy of his Decyphering
Shakespeare, 1’34, a beautifully
bound book which the author evi-
dently, has had printed at his own
expense. Mr..Feely‘s purpose is “to
show scientiﬁcally that in the First
Folio 3. cipher conveys an intelligible
message.” The book consists of a col-
lection of the author’s work sheets in
which he shows certain passages
traversed “not only by one run of
cipher, but by several, like a fugue,
and often in opposite directions, with
different messages.” The pages are
mazes of numbers, lines, letters, outer
and inner keys, ebbe runs, down
runs, doublets, .meanders, ,musical.
notes and what not. In general, one‘
gathers from the book that the
Shakespearian plays contain a code
that, when altogether deciphered will
furnish those interested with a com-
plete and intelligent autobiography of
the true author. For careful inspec-
tion, however, Mr. Feely’s work is
recommended only to graduate stu-
dents in the mathematics department.

Ever since they began writing, the

Baconians and decipherers have had '

to run a gauntlet of satire. One of
the best of these burlesques was
written by Ellis Parker Butler, in
which he tells of an incident that
occurred to him while he was visit-
ong Stratford-on-Avon. He had or-
dered ham and‘ eggs at a local inn
when the waitress replied: “The ’am
is hall ’et, sir, but I could give you
some‘ ’am omelette, sir. Or some ba-
con, sir.”

Butler told hom this remark caught
his attetion. By considering the words
carefully, he discovered that they
were a cryptogrammatical phonorythm
which he explained in this way: “If
the utterly useless syllable ‘om’ be
dropped from ‘ham omelette,’ we have
‘hamlette’ or ‘Hamlet’ . . But why
did the serving maid utter the word
‘sir’ three times? Evidently but to
emphasize it. ‘Sir——-sir—sir!’ Sir
what? Sir Bacon! In other words, she
was telling me that Sir Bacon was
the author of Hamlet. I was imme-
diately convinced. She was a very
very pretty girl. Truth and beauty
are one!”

More thoughtful was the answer of
Richard Grant VVhite to the Bacon-
ians. By the veiy nature of the two
works, he pointed out, Bacon’s and
that accredited to Shakespeare could
not have been written by the same
man. Bacon was a cautious observer,
whereas Shakespeare glowed with
constant inspiration; Bacon was a
logical man whereas Shakespeare
soared on wings; Bacon sought to
prove all things, Shakespeare to prove
nothing; Bacon was cautious, Shake-
speare was large, free and ﬂexible;
Bacon was without humor, Shake-
speare was forever smiling; and Ba-
con was wholly without poetic fac-
ulty, whereas Shakespeare uncon-
sciously ascended the heights of
poetic grandeur. It is such literary
seiisitivity and incisive realization as
this that the ciphers and cryptograms
of the Baconians fail to answer.

group choice if we can prove our legal
stand. Ah think that’s been done.”

Willison injected the opinion that
neither side had proven anything, with
both protesting their stands as being
right. He declared that the only way
in which council can be maintained on
campus is by a more harmonious
working together of its component
parts. Theodore W. Biddle, assistant
to the dean of men and faculty ad-
viser of council, then stated that the
weight of evidence as to the correct-
ness of the two stands was slight in
either direction. However, he warned
that council might be dissolved by
the University administration unless
the two factions got together and
worked out their diﬂiculties. He in-
timated to Beta that to demand the
whole slate of oflices would be greedy
to the highest degree, and informed
that group that in the past ﬁve years,
25 of the 45 executive positions in
Council have been held by former
members of Beta fraternities.

Willison then offered his plan for
the settling of the difficulties. He
ﬁrst stated that no man would de-
sire to hold office in “an organiza-
tion -‘-which stinks” and «inferred that
for either group to ho-ld all power
would place that blot on council. “None
of our men has to resign,” he said,
“but, since Alpha really wants to
work for the best interest of the coun-
cil, the vice-president and the secre-
tary, have come forward with offers
to resign. These oﬂices may then be
ﬁlled. But understand that these men
are under no compulsion whatever!”
Willison stressed the fact that coun-
ci1’s “four-week fuss” to elect officers
with all its resulting “bad publicity”
has done the organization much harm
on_ campus and in the eyes of the ad-
ministration. He stated that should
no agreement be reached, the Council
would be done away with as unneces-
sary.

A short debate ensued during which
Derr classiﬁed the recent publicity
as “bad, according to one viewpoint.”

George Roll, C35, Phi Kappa presi-
dent, then asked the following ques-
tion of Derr and Hubacher: “Do you
favor a system of checks and bal-
ances such as is included in the na-
tional constitution?”

_Derr: “As a student of political
science, I ﬁrmly do not!”

Hubacher: “Though no student of
political science, Ah don’t either!”

Roll: “Well, there usually is one,
and in this case it happens to be the
University. We’ve got to get to-
gether here!”

Albert Franks, D35, Phi Epsilon Pi
representative, then took the ﬂoor.
“Willison,” he began, “I don’t think
you or Alpha cares a hoot for the
good of Interfraternity council in any
manner other than as it concerns Al-
pha directly.” Willison countered by
dubbing the statement “narrow-mind-
ed and unthought out.”

Derr followed Franks’ remarks with
a statement questioning the sincerity
of Alpha in declaring itself working
for the best interest of Council and
also doubted its willingness to com-
promise fairly. He cited the attempt
of Alpha to break the power of Beta
by offering various bribes, including a
Druid “plum” to a Beta house if it
would jump coalitions.

A ﬁfteen_minute recess was then
called by Willison to give Beta an op-
portunity to decide whether it would
accept the proposed compromise which
would give Beta the vice-presidency
and the secretaryship.

After the recess Derr began, “We
believe that Alpha desires a com-
promise; we also believe this desire is
made in good faith. We of Beta have
decided that instead of sweeping your
slate clean and taking all offices (as
we can do, according to our by-laws),
we, too, shall be fair. We are pre-
pared to accept the resignations of
two off'icers——the president and the
secretary.”

Willison declared himself unprepar-
ed to resign. Another debate ensued
in which both sides declined to yield.
Another recess, this one of ﬁve min-
utes, was called.

When the meeting resumed, Silver-
blatt offered Beta any two of the
three offices of vice president, secre-
tary, or treasurer. The offer was re-
jected. Silverblatt then said: “There
is no reason why we should give you
the presidency. We hold four offices.
What we do offer is undeniably mag-
nanimous. There is no court that

would say we must do anything.
Chieﬂyf you can't depose us!”

Derr: “I maintain my former
stand.”

A motion for adjournment, spon-
sored by Alpha, was defeated, 7-6.

Derr then declared that Beta was
ready to accept the resignations of
vice-president, secretary, and treas-
urer. Alpha refused this.

Hubacher then made the evening’s
first workable proposal. He suggested
that the names of the four oﬂicers be
placed in a hat, two drawn, and the
other two be allowed to retain their
offices. Roll ridiculed and dismissed
this as “Chi]d’s p1ay——-next time bring
your blohks to Council.”

The meeting remained deadlocked
for a few minutes, after-which Hu-
-bacher repeated his motion of the pre-
vious meeting, calling for the removal
of Willison, Rodgers, Israel, and
Bowdler from office. Biddle inter-
rupted at this point to warn that such
action would prove harmful to coun-
cil. A sudden motion by Rodgers for
adjournment was defeated 7-6. Hu-
bacher’s motion was seconded and
passed, 7-6.

All Alpha men rose to leave the
meeting, but decided to stay as James
H3I‘V€.V, C35, Sigma Alpha Epsilon
president, made and put a motion to
have McClain and Golanty made tem-
porar_y president and secretary re-
spectively. The motion passed and
McClain opened nominations. He was
elected president without opposition.
Derr nominated Willison for vice-
president, but Willison declined “to
take oﬂice in an extinct organization.”
The complete Beta ticket was then
installed. -

_Roll then moved for adjournment,
with a unanimous vote resulting.

‘Now that it is over, Beta men in-
sist that the executive committee
would have been split equally between
the two factions, but Willison’s re-
fusal demonstrated Alpha’s unwilling-
ness to cooperate “for the good of
Council.” They _also assert that the
making of a motion by Roll does dem-
onstrate that the new chair and ad-
ministration have been recognized.

Immediately before adjournment,
Derr stated that at the next meeting

,he will submit a proposal to widen
‘the scope of the organization and of

its constitution.

After the meeting Alpha men de_
clared themselves just as dissatisﬁed
with the officers chosen as Beta men
were before the meeting started,

privilege has been extended the Spring
Festival dance to sell tickets at the.
door. To get these tickets students
must have registration card or other
identiﬁcation. This privilege extended
for two reasons: ﬁrst, the dance is
a. beneﬁt for the ‘Complete the Ca-
thedral’ campaign; and second, there
being no school today, it is only fair
to give the dance committee addi-
tional time to sell tickets.”

Chinese Study Harder Than

Americans, Pitt Sisters Say

 

“The students of Chinese universi-
ties work harder‘ than American‘ stu-
dents." That is the opinion of R0-
salie Yee Quil, a Chinese student in

the College. Her sister, Grace Yee
Quil, also enrolled in the College,
agreed.

Although born in Pittsburgh, the
girls learned at ﬁrst hand how Chi-
nese live, when they went on a visit
to Canton and the southern part of
China, in the summer of 1932. ,

Of course such a statement required
a. reason and an explanation. “The
average Chinese family has far less
wealth than the average American
family,” said Rosalie. “In most cases
a Chinese mother a.iid father must
sacriﬁce about everything to send
their boy or girl to college, and the
student to justify the sacriﬁce, always
makes the most of his opportunity.”

When it was suggested that many
American parents also have to forego
cream in their morning coffee, and

Dr. Giardini Explains Plan
For Classing Of Prisoners

 

A plan for the classiﬁcation of
prisoners in Pennsylvania was ex-
plained by Dr. Giardini, psychologist
of Western Pennsylvania penitentiary,
at the Psychology forum, Mo_nd_ay.
April 30. The advantages and limita-
tions of such a classiﬁcation were out-
lined in his address. _ ,

The plan, which would facilitate
both administrative and educational
work in the institiitioiis, has Several
limitations, Dr. Giardini told the group.
The ﬁrst of these is the criminal him-
self. His capabilities are limited and
it is expensive to have ‘trade train-
ing in which everybody is permitted
to participate. The institutions and
their personnel also present dlfﬁC1ll-
ties, since most states havent the
number of prisons or the equipment
necessary, and the guards are usual-
ly not capable enoiigh_ The laws also
hinder the plan, as they do I10t PTO-
vide for the transfel‘ Of D1‘iS0D€1‘S

must wear the same coat three years,
so that Will-ie or Jane can go to
school, Rosalie insisted that there was
no comparison between the two sit-
uations and that Americans hardly
knew the meaning of the word “sacri-
ﬁce.”

When asked why Chinese spoke so
often in ﬁgurative language and used
such a great number of quotations, a
la. the best Chinese movie scripts,
Grace knew the answer. “It’s because ,
Chinese instructors require their pu-i
pils to learn by heart books of
Oriental classics, so that they can re-
peat on demand, in the sing-song pe-
culiar to our race, as many pages as
the teacher requires.”

The girls were the ﬁrst Chinese to
graduate from Vvilkinsburg high
school. Rosalie was Valedictorian of
her class and a member of the Na-
tional Honor society. Grace also
made the Honor society and was
graduated high in her class.

of the ﬁve major institutions of this
state. The total in these is from 5,-
000 to 6,000 at present. The sug-
gestion is to keep the whole Eastern
penitentiary as the place for the least
hopeful cases; that is, those whom
we feel it would be a loss of time
and money to train. The Western pen-
itentiary and the branch of the East-
ern penitentiary will be reserved for
those cases who have former prison
records, but are hopeful. Those cases
having their ﬁrst offenses, and who
are the most hopeful, will be sent
to Huntington and the Rockview
branch of the VVestern penitentiary.”

The prisons will, of course, need
more employes if this plan is to be
carried out. Altogether they will need
ten more psychologists, ﬁve more
stenographers, and a part-time
psychiatrist. According to Dr. Giar-
dini, the prisoners’ conditions will

Trackmen A Le ave
Today For State

Olson Takes Varsity, Freshman

; Teams To Meet Tomorrow i

 

 

 

Pitt’s track and ﬁeld men will be
out for their second outdoor dual meet
victory in as many starts when they
compete against the trackmen of Penn
State at State tomorrow. Coach Ol-
son is taking a large squad of varsity
and freshman athletes to the meet,
the party being scheduled to leave this
afternoon.

Although the fear which the Pan-
thers felt for the Temple Owls in a
recent meet appeared a bit premature
in the light of Pitt’s overwhelming
triumph, nevertheless Olson and his
men are expecting anything but a
Walkaway in tomorrow’s meet. Year
in and year out, the Lions present
well-balanced track outﬁts and the
Panthers must be in top form if they
hope to take the measure of the men
from State.

the scheduled events follows:

100-yard dash: Varsity—MiIIigan, Schloss-
berg‘. Jacobson, Fleming. McMunn. Freshmen
