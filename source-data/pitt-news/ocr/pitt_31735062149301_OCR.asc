has been extended for one more
week, according to Al Kairys, C39,
business manager of the year book.

“While almost all of the seniors
have had their pictures taken and
have been well pleased with the
results, there are a few who have
been unable to get down because
of the holiday last Friday, and the
great last minute rush. Therefore,
we will give them one more week
in which to purchase their 1939
Owls and have portraits made,”
stated Kairys.

This announcement will delay
the ﬁnal date for purchases and
pictures until November 21, one
week from today. Word also comes
from the Owl oﬁice that ﬁve dol-
lars in cash will be awarded the

V five books. If no salesman reaches
that mark, the money will go to
the one who most nearly approach-

I Fund Divisions

All students contributing a dollar
or more to the Community Fund will
receive 1939 memberships in the
American Red Cross. _

By special arrangement with the
Community Fund, the University
keeps 75 per cent of the money rais-
ed in the student drive and diverts’
this money into University aid chan--
nels. Thus 40 cents of every stu-
dent dollar is divided between the
University YMCA and YWCA, and.
30 cents is divided between the Men’s
and Women’s Student Loan funds.
The remaining ﬁve cents goes to Pitt.
in China, Ling Nan university.

In this manner, the student ‘con-
tribution to the Community Fund
removes the necessity of conduct-
ing six separate drives for funds.

Student Goal

Goal for the student contributions
to the Community Fund has been set
at $3,000 or an average of one dollar
per student, Registrar J. G. Quick,
lchairman of the University drive,
{stated This goal must be attained
if the $10,000 budget for the‘ Uni-
sity’s combined student—facu1ty
drive is to be met. To reach this goal
some students will have to contribute
more than one dollar in order to bal-
ance the contributions of those less:
able to pledge. I A '

Last year’s returns showed that
the students had cont:ributed,,an-ave1r-
age of 97 cents each, William Men».-

YMCA, of the student drive commit-
tee, stated. .

SFA President Requests End
Of Pitt-Tech Goalpost Feud’  . 

“Please don’t organize any more¢-

ﬂying trips to the Tech campus to
recover the lost goalposts,” says John
-Downie, C39, and president of SFA,
“They’re gone.”

Tech Attacks

Thus ends a hectic week-end that
began with the Carnegie Tech defeat
and the desire of some of the Tech
undergraduates to get a goalpost from
the stadium.

After failing in an attempt to get
the posts Saturday after the game
and during the night, a Tech group
went to the stadium in force. Mon-
day morning. When it found the
posts protected by University
groundkeepers and students, the
group went up to the practice ﬁeld to
play touch football until Jimmy Ha-
gan, University director athletics
could be reached. After a strenuous
game, word came that Mr. Hagan
had said that the posts were not to be
defended. In fact the groundkeep-
ers had unscrewed them from their
bases. .
. Goalpost Won

A jubilant crowd carried them to
the lawn in _front_of Scobell Hall on
'Carnegie’s campus where the stu-
dents proceeded to imbed them in

steel reinforced concrete. _ ,

Tuesday night, a movement among
the freshmen football team, gather-
ed at the downtown-aﬁairs, got un-.
derway and in the face of Tech"s'
complete preparation with be1ls,_.
guards, and cement, they went tore-
cover the posts.

Tech Defends

Four Tech “dorms” rose to the de-
fense of their prize and caught
three University men, before they
could ﬂee ~ with the others. While
these players were being held, some-
one contacted Downie, Wh0_. gather-.
ed a few aides and went over to pre-
vent any further outbreaks and, res-
cued the prisoners. -

Goalposts Sold

Wednesday afternoon the Carnegie’
Student Council announced the re-
moval of the posts, which were to be-
broken up and sold to alumni, with
proceeds to go to the Wally Steﬁair
Memorial Fund. ' '

Downie, asks that the student body
refrain from further attempts ‘to
recover the goalposts, and that no‘
further action be.taken by any group
which might lead to strained. relations
between the schools. ' L

Three Cents Extra
For A Good Cause

Today and toinorrow, one of our ace reporters
inforn‘-.s us. are "red feather” days on the Univer-
sity calendar. \\'hich means, to put it less subtly,
that these are the days when students are custom-
‘-arily touched for contributions to the annual Com-
Jnuuity Fund drive.

I The ends of the Connnunity Fund—its humani-
tarian objectives, its already time-worn slogan, “Be
a (loocl .\'eig'l1ln)r.” are too well-known to require
any attention here. '.-hit its local aspects, the old
question of "Where does; my money go?” are
usually a little more puzzling.

Amt):-tliiig to our news story, 75 per cent of the
inoncv collected from students stays in the U11iver-
isity. the rest being diverted to the general fund.
of this 7-3 per cent, 40 per cent goes to the Univer-
sity YM and YWCA, 30 to the men's and women ’s
student loan funds. and the remaining ﬁve cents 011
every dollar to the l’itt-in-China fund, which goes
to the support of Lingnan University i11 Canton,
China.

With these statistics before him, we can’t see
how the average student can begrudge the fund
that extra dollar which returns to him in so many
ways through the activities of these campus organ-
izations.

- . ,,_We are told that one dollar is the expected c011-
t1'ibi1tio11. Thus, one dollar from every student so-
--licited would multiply up to $3,000, goal of the
student drive.

Last year the average student contributions
was 97 cents. We don’t think it would be too
much of a. hardship to contribute that extra little

., three cents and put over this year’s campaign
even more successfully than in years before.

Peace Propagandists
Versus ‘Scare-Mongers’

_ The sound movies of war in Spain and China,
shown last week under the sponsorship of Pitt
Peace Council, seem to be docu1ncnta1'_v proof of
the failure of peace societies. _ p

"In spite of the agitation of anti-war movements
th'rougl1out the world, civilian populations are still
being bombed. The consensus of opinion is: what’s
the use?

Perhaps the answer is that the totalitarian
countries which have been responsible for recent
aggression do not permit‘ peace societies to func-
tion at all. Their effectiveness may thus-be demon-

‘ World War;

Onderdonk
Discusses
League

By Ruggero Aldisert

To counteract the advances of the
two paranoics, Hitler and Mussolini,
the United States 1nust immediately
join the League of Nations.

So thinks Dr. Francis Skillman On-
derdonk, author, architect, and stu-
dent of international affairs, who ad-
dressed a Pitt Peace Council spon-
sored—Inquiry Forum last Wednes-
day.

“Imperial countries today, such as
Japan, Germany, and Italy are in the
control of fanatics. We should not
condone the people of these countries,
but instead put strength into the
League of Nations by immediately
joining it,” declared Dr. Onderdonk.

He believes that the League of Na-
tions was not. a failure. “Itsettled
40 disputes among European coun-
tries; it averted nine wars through
its efficient council at Geneva.”

“The most outstanding example of
the value of the league came  1926
in the settlement of the dispute be-
tween Bulgaria and Greece. Within
24 hours the council of the League
ﬂew to parts, deliberated with the

"disputing parties, and stopped the

coming military conﬂict one hour be-
fore hostilities were to start.”

Dr. Onderdonk’s illustrated lecture
consisted of a series of silent and
talking ﬁlms. He began his program
by picturing domestic scenes of peace
among the Chinese and Japanese,
emphasizing the simplicity of the
people and their apparent indiﬁer—
once to imperial expansion.

“But a military clique got control.
of the Japanese foreign policy and
turned the emperor into a religious
fanatic,” he continued. His screen
then showed uncensored reels of the
bombing of Nanking; shots of emer-
gency treatment at ﬁrst aid stations;
and a series of gruesome burials.

At several times during the pro-
gram D1‘. Onderdonk had to suggest
women in the audience to turn their
heads aside so they might not View
the more horrlblescenes of carnage.
Included in these were shots-show-'
ing decapitation of Chinese prison-
ers of war and disﬁgurations result-
ing from the “human bonﬁres” held
by the Japanese.

Besides the Sino—Japanese war, his
ﬁlms showed the sinking of the Ger-
man steamship Helgoland during the
action at the Bilbao
l'ront_:‘ and cartoon satirizing the arm-
ament race.

His concluding remarks were in
the form of an appeal for an eco-
nomic boycott on Japan. “Thousands

of sill;—stocki.nged girls stand in foot-

ball‘ stadiums every Saturday, little
realizing that 54‘per cent of the war
materials used by Japan come from
the United States.”

Dear Sir:

This morning we awoke to discov-

been decorated by an effective, it‘

Every form of art has some expres-

expression is on the emotional effect.

This peculiar exhibit of talent of
which I write was meant to provoke
humor. People walking by the Sig-

ed to laugh at the ridiculous appear-
ance of our lions.

Such is not the case." People do not
laugh at a scene of wanton destruc-

we like to believe, that we are :1

Cornhuskers, 19-O

Leading what is hoped to be a national trend—-—the return to

norn1alcy—Dr. Jock Sutl1erland’s

football Panthers acted a great

deal more like Ilieiiiselves Saturday afternoon in the budget-baL
anced state of Nebraska, when both their yarcls-gained and points-
scored were re-established in affluency.

Giving further proof that you can knock a good man down but
you can ’t keep him there, the Panthers quickly climbed out of the

valley of depression and back to their?

rightful place in the football worldg
by cobbing the Nebraska Cornhusk-l
ers, 19-0, in the fourteenth game ofg
an intersectional rivalry that has!

seen little but Pitt wins.

In going about its seventh_ tri-§
umph of the current semester, Pitt’
showed itself still a little punchy in‘;
the beginning. Gradually, however,§

Cornhuskers Err

The Panthers went up and down
‘the ﬁeld with no trouble at all. J ust
the same their scoring was, in the
majority, directly attributable to two
breaks, both of which were the re-
sults of Nebraska errors.

First, there was the event of early .

second quarter. Bill Callihan fum-
bled on a Biff Jones trick play and
alert Joe Rettinger cornered the
market for the Panthers on the Corn-
husker 10-yard line. Dr. Jock
promptly reinvested his first team
in the game.

This surety brought back the ex-
pected dividends. In three slick
plays Dick Cassiano had the touch-
down, although never-miss-a-goal-
post Bill Daddio didn’t come through
with the extra point. This experi-
ence, however sent the Panthers in-
to the dressing room with a lead for
the ﬁrst time in two weeks.

Kish Scores

Second in the way of breaks-to-
be—capitali2'ed occured in the mid-
dle of the third quarter. A Nebraska
punt went screwy on the Cornhusk-
er's own 27-yard line. With Cassi-
ano and Stebbins taking turns going
around the ends the ball was put
into position for a line buck by full-
back Ben Kish, who had replaced
Larry Peace, who had replaced Mar-

shall Goldberg in the Pan'ther‘s don’t-

fto do with Pitt's third touchdown
l "as the break in the Nebraska line
{when the Panther blockers went to
lwork. It was Pitt power going for
368 yards. Two passes, both caught
by quarterback Chickerneo and a 27-
yard run from punt formation by
Kish highlighted the drive.
g Dick Cassiano ﬁnally went over for
l the touchdown and Bill Daddio's kick
was true to complete the Pitt scoring
and the entire game‘s point-making.
d This happened in the ﬁnal period.

During the first half Pitt was not
exactly the crisp, wide-awake team
that it had been all through Oc-
tober. While there was not much
diﬁ‘iculty'to be had in picking up
yardage, the Panthers didn’t seem to
be getting any place.

Cassiano Stars

In the last half, they were re-
viviﬁed. Two long sustained
.marches featured the play. All aft-
ernoon the ball-carrying seemed to
be under copy-right to Cassiano and
Stebbins.

Both -boys gavea good acount of
themselves as they kept nipping
through the Nebraska line for short,
clear-cut gains.

Pitt practically dragged the Corn-
huskers up and down the length and
width of the ﬁeld. More than 300
yards and 19 ﬁrst. downs were re-
corded by- the Panthers in their
prairie march.

Newman Wins Crown

On the basis of previous games,

should give the Mets the most trou-
ble. The old reliable, Leith, Mann,
Pataky, and Underwood look like the
Metallurgists’ fair-haired boys.

Engineers in Race

Games in the Engineering League
during the past week and a half have
been monopolized by the two clubs
who meet today. The Chem Juniors,f;
after ‘earlier dropping Electrical B,
19-0, felt the power of the rejuven-
ated Electricals as Wilkenson went
over for the only score of the game.

A ﬁghting CE team fell before the
superior . Metallurgists,
19-6, despite" the brilliant work of
Captain Al Ackenheil who caught‘,
one of Bill Smith’s passes for his
team’s only score. Reilly, Mann, and
Gross hit paydirt for the Mets and
Underwood added one extra point on
the receiving end ‘of an aerial.
Although improved, Electrical B
did not hit their full stride until last
Thursday, toppling the demoralized
CEs under a 19-7 onslaught. _.Tomb‘
and Wilkenson caught passes from
Krane to chalk up the ﬁrst two
touchdowns, and Donic added a third
with a run. ‘
Quinn tacked on an extra point,
as did Spence for the CEs after Ack-
enheil had gathered In a Bill Smith
pass for the CE touchdown. The de-
cisive manner in which the Elec-
tricals overpowered their opposition
offered several rays of hope for the
members of the “Who’s going to beat
the Metallurgists?" club.

Positions Indeﬁnite

Although their positions are not’
deﬁnite, the probable starting lineup
for the Electricals will include Du-
gar, Donic, Krane, Quinn, Upte-
graph, Miller, Tomb, Bright, and
Wilkenson. The Metallurgists should
counter with Underwood, Reilly,
Mann. Knapp, Leith, Pataky, Ash-

151s Battle
Phi Delts

F or Title

By Bert Jaffee

Phi Gamma Delta plays Phi Delta
Theta this afternoon at 3:30 o’clock
for the Interfraternity touch football
championship.

The Phi Delts earned the right to
play the Phi Gams when they de-
teated Delta Tau Delta on Thursday
afternoon, 12-2.

The Delts scored ﬁrst on a safety
as Bob Black was tabbed by “Happy”
Stickle behind the goal line as Bob
attempted to run 1'rom fake punt for-
mation. The Delts received the open-
ing kickoff and marched down ﬁeld
to the Phi Delt one-yard_ line on
passes from Cooper. They lost the
ball at this point and then Black was
tabbed for the safety.

‘Naste Little Time

The Phi Delts wasted little time in
taking the lead. Cashdollar kicked
oil‘, and the Delts scrimmaged the
ball deep in their own territory. Fail-
ing to, gain on the ﬁrst two downs,
Chuck Cooper went back to kick.
His ﬁrst punt was knocked into the
air on a block by lVIiller and Angel,
and Danny Snyder caught the ball

i
l
a

1; on the goalline for a" Phi Delt touch-

down. Cashdollar’s drop kick was
low. The touchdown came two min-
utes after the start of the game.

Neither team threatened to score
in. the ﬁrst half. The Delts almost
had a score when Cooper threw; a
long pass to Edgar Jones, but the
ball slipped off Jones’ ﬁnger tips

Phi Delt secondary. ,
_ -_ In the second half ‘both teams were

down, and the Phi Delts seemed con-
tent to play ‘defensive ‘ball and pro-
tect their lead. After 12"minutes had
elapsed, the Phi Delts clinched the
game as Bob Black pulled down
Cashdollar’s‘ pass in the end zone.
Cashdollar’s toss to Larry Smith for
the extra point was knocked down
by Kennedy. ,
Delts Throw Passes .‘

Statistics of the game show that
the Delts threw a total of 37 passes,
31 by Cooper, and completed 10 for
an efficiency average of 27 per cent.
The Phi Delts completed 5 out of 17
for an average of 28 per cent.

one point, the Phi Delts defeated Pi
Kappa Alpha last Wednesday, 7-6.
Art Todd proved himself to be the
hero of the Phi Delt victory as he
entered the game for a single play,
that of drop kicking the point after
touchdown, and then left the ﬁeld.

That one point turned out to be
the crimper in the PiKA attempt to
bring the touch football trophy to
Belleﬁeld Street. PiKA scored early
in the game after recovering a fum-
bled punt on the 20-yard line. Jim
Napier whipped a high pass over
Cashdollai-’s head to George Davies
in the end zone.

First Half Scoreless
The Phi Delts were held scoreless
the first half, but unleashed their
power in the second half to advance
40 yards on ﬁve consecutive passes.
On the ﬁrst one Parks passed to Lar-
ry Smith for 10 yards, then he sailed
‘one over center to McLeod for ﬁve
yards, the next one was caught by
'vCox for 10, the following one was
lcaught by Cashdollar on the two-
yard line.

The ﬁnal pass was caught in the
corner of the end zone by Larry

the list with 30 points, closely fol-

high average if we remove all
those below a certain grade,” states
Dr. Charlesworth. “However, we
only dropped three out of the en-
tire group.”

Of the 69 students in the gov-
ernment service course, eight had a
three point average.
