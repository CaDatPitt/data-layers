Book Center Employee Refused Compensation

By MARK A. SINDLER‘

The state unemployment compen-
sation office recently rejected a uni-
versity Book Center employee's bid
to gain benefits after he claimed he
was unfairly fired on Jan. I3, I983.
_ On March I l, referee Michael
Fedor decided in favor of Pitt, who
objected to Charles Delaney’s ﬁling
for unemployment compensation
upon his being terminated. Delaney
and Tim Brady were fired in mid-
January and three other book center
employees were suspended for one
day for what they believe is the uni-
versity’s attempts to thwart union
representation in the bookstore.

Fedor reached his decision after
reviewing details leading to Dela-
ney’s termination. Fedor’s fact-
finding report noted that because
the bookstore handles the unusual
amount of traffic at the beginning of
the term, Delaney’s supervisors
required him to follow store policies
regarding mandatory overtime.

The report further stated that Del-
aney should have been aware of his
boss’ rules. Delaney did not report

J. for overtime on Jan. 4 at 6 p.m. as a

work schedule required that he do
during the week of Jan. 3-7.

After Delaney was given notice of
a one-day suspension effective Jai..
l0, the report said that he “physi-
cally threatened the bodily well-

being of his immediate supervisor.” _

The bookstore has a policy whereby
it discharges any employees who use
physical violence on any other uni-
versity employees.

With that reasoning in mind,
Fedor then concluded that Section
402 [e] of the Office of Employment
Security provides that claimants are
not eligible for unemployment com-
pensation ifthe termination is due to
willful misconduct.

According to Delaney, he was
never clearly given a set work sche-
dule for that one week when the
bookstore is inundated with new-
book buyers.

“There was no schedule posted,”
he said. “At that time, you had an
assistant director [Peter Solento],
Jesse Peters [immediate supervisor]
and Dave Held [Peter’s assistant
supervisor], who gave me three dif-
ferent opinions concerning whether
there'd be mandatory overtime that
week or not.”

Delaney continued, “One said,
‘Maybe you'll work;' one said,
‘Could be you'll work;'and the other
said, ‘Possibly you'll work.’ And I
brought that out at the unemploy-
ment hearing, and l was imme-
diately cut of

Delaney further explained that
last week’s hearing did not exhibit
fairness under the law.

“As far as [Fedor] went, he didn't
even recognize my side,” Delaney
said. ‘‘It sort of seemed to me that he

already had his mind made up and
we were just going through the
motions more or less.”

Bookstore administrators and
other university supervisors refused
to comment about Delaney’s
employment status in mid-January,
standing by earlier statements that

Wliners Get Buried By Rocky
lcompetition In Colorado

By BRIAN BALK

The typical engineering stu-
dent attends class, memorizes
theories and mentally applies
concepts. Yet, few engineers
have the opportunity to gain
tangible experience in their
respective fields.

A group of ll mining engi-
neering students, however, got
enough hands-on experience to
last a lifetime at the Intercolle-
giate Mining Competition held
last weekend in Golden, Colo.
Fifteen male and 8 female
teams, from as far as Alaska,
competed for this year’s coveted
mining trophy. Both male and
female teams participated in a

series of five mining events as

they would not release such personal
information about employees.
Delaney was also without the ser-
vices of an attorney at the hearing
because he could not afford the ser-
vices of one, he said. ‘‘I tried to find
an attorney previously, but there
was nothing to be found,” he said.

well as a beer-chugging tie
breaker. (The competition was
sponsored by Coors.)

“This was the first time a team
from the East ever competed in
the competition," Jackie Pine,
one of the members of Pitt's
female squad, said. “We were the
only coal miners there, all the
other teams were hard rock
miners."

Being the only eastern school
presented a number of problems
for the Pitt Miners, one of which
was encountered in an event
called the Jack Leg Drill.

“We never even saw a Jack Leg
Drill until last Friday,“ Audrey
Dunahay said. “I only had two
minutes to drag the drill and
pound it in the rock. It took me
the entire two minutes to just

of the other fired bookstore
employee, Brady. He said that the
office has not yet received any infor-
mation from the Office of Employ-
ment Security as to whether Brady
filed for compensation.

drag the drill—it weighed more
than me.”

Needless to say, the Pitt Min-
ers did not fare too well in this
event.

The men’s team took last in a
field of burly miners, some of
whom trained three hours each
day for the competition.

“We were out-muscled and
out-experienced,” George
McCaa, the faculty sponsor and
team's coach said. “But I am
quite proud of all of them."

The Pitt Miners were not the
quickest, strongest or most skill-
ful of the competitors, but they
had the most spirit.

“We weren’t the most talented
team there, but we sure were the

Red tape is a problem common to

Large schools process huge
amounts of information, and even to
the disgruntlement of both students
and administrators, this takes time.

tration line or at the cafeteria.

Problems with red tape come from

admission forms, which require
timeconsuming corrections.

He also commented on peak peri-
ods when the number of students
overloads the system.

Overloading occurs at the office
when things such as rejection letters
and awards are distributed, he said.
"In most cases, the number has
nothing to do with the process. Large
numbers don't usually affect it."

“Governmental regulation and
misinformation are the biggest prob
lems we deal with,"_,Merante said.

According to him, Student Aid
and Admissions do not have a major
problem in this area, but they do
have many of the same difficulties
others do.

“We have tremendous problems A

with state loans," Merante explained.
He said that the current system of
sending loans through the bank then
to the state and back again is very
time consuming.

While this is a problem, there is
little that can be done about it.

"Every dollar comes from some-
where. and there is a string attached
to every one of them."

May explained that the federal
government has many rules that his
office must obey. Each program has
its own requirements that must be
met.

He also said, "One of Reagan's
campaign promises was to deregu-
late, but in recent years, it has turned
into a significant increase in
regulation."

May said that general reduction in
rules would make things a lot easier
for his department which handles
$40 million a year.

"For this office, red tape is now a
major problem," May said. "Redtape
is a fact of life when you deal with this
many dollars."

He also said they have problems
with students who make mistakes on
forms. May gave some suqqestions

to help eliminate mistakes and
delays.

First, read the instructions. This
department spends a great deal of
time writing them [the instructions]
and misreading them complicates
the situation.

Second, do things in a timely
manner. If a form is due in April, ﬁle it
in April.

Third, problems and questions
should be taken care of at counsel-
ling sessions before problems arise.

James Beavers
Business Manager Food
Service

"We have to have a system that
can handle the number of people we‘
have here. The system (housing lot-
tery) has to give everyone an equal
chance.”

Beavers explained that 80 percent
of the housing contracts are ready
for processing prior to end of winter
term but 50 percent have to be
mailed out due to delays on both
ends (students and Housing Ofﬁce).

Failure to ﬁnish processing forms

by the Housing Ofﬁce and to submit-

the complete forms by the students
leads to the delays and problems
most people experience with
housing.

The majority of complaints that
arise from the lottery system are
from people with bad numbers, he
said. "People who draw good

numbers are never the ones who
complain.“

"ltiis an additional cost; it's a delay
getting it out and checking to see if
it's in yet," he said.

Assistant Registrar

but the student who gets closed out

Repasi said that “we don't want to

"We all have rules and regulations to

According to Repasi, the regis-

cut as much red tape as possible.
Things such as going’ over forms

mistakes and soliciting extra help at

Irish
 Lesson

St. Patrick’s Day. Americans—-whether Irish
or not— go to great lengths to celebrate being
Irish. Now another St. Patrick’s day has passed,
marking still another year in which that cele-

~. brated Emerald Isle is torn by internal conﬂict.

Ireland has a long history of violence, and
today that land is quickly associated with terror-
ists, bombs and death. Each year at this time, as
most Americans are drinking green beer and
wondering what “Erin go bragh” means, promi-
nent Irish-Americans come forward to call for
peace in their homeland. These calls are most
often shrugged off by the public as futile. Nice,
but futile. After all, what can Americans do?

First of all, Americans—whether Irish or not-
can be concerned. Many claim that Northern
Ireland is a British problem-—none of our busi-
ness. But such a continued waste of human lives is
aehuman problem. The cheapening of human life
that is occuring in Northern Ireland makes politi-
cal boundries insigniﬁcant.

Second, Americans should take a stand; The
importance of even the moral support offered by
Americans to both sides in the Irish conflict
should not be underestimated. That influence
should now be used not just to back one side or
the other, but also to inﬂuence them. This means
knowing who one is supporting, and how, or if,
that group is working for peace. In addition, it
means making a positive call for peace. When
writing letters to the IRA or Margaret Thatcher,
the last remark should always be, “but let’s do it
peacefully.”

Finally, Americans should not forget the sim-
ilarities between Irish violence and the turbulence
intthe Middle East and South America. In all
these areas, people are struggling for the right to
determine how and by whomgthey will be gov-
erned. If history is any guide, this kind of struggle
will not soon disappear from the world. We must
learn how to settle this sort of conflict peacefully,
or there will be no end to the human cost. Why
not start learning that lesson in Ireland?

Time For New Ideas

Dear Editor:

It is a pity that so many arguments
these days are still couched in the old
language of capitalism vs. socialism,
as in the recurrent drumbeating by

' one Scott Rex and ( on Mar. 14) his

anonymous “working class” critic.
As the latter argues, there is indeed a

“working economic depression,” but .

the problems of “exploitation,
depression and death to workers”
can no longer be labeled a “capital-
ist” phenomenon.

Contrary to what economic theor-
ies tell us, it seems likely (as histori-
ans long have noted) that
overbuilding of industrial capacity
and overproduction on farms are the

causes, not the effects. of depression.

In countless industries today, there

is far more production capacity than
could be used to meet virtually any
conceivable level of demand. This
occurs, as it must, because in any

. competitive market, many suppliers

Dear Editor:

It was interesting to read “Gandhi
and Assam" (amusingly misspelt
“Gandhi and Asam”) in The Pitt
News (March 9. I983) not so much
for the intent of the letter as for its
reference to the carnage in Assam.

While I appreciate the writer’s
concern about the questionable feas-
ibility of non-violence as a political
technique today, I would like to
place the Assam incident in its
proper perspective. The staggering
figure of the loss of “3,600 lives“ in
Assam (The New York Times
reports 2,000, and India Abroadand
News India report 2,500.) is
undoubtedly a human tragedy
unparalleled in recent Indian
history.

However, the violence between
Assamese tribesmen and “Bengalis"
(mainly Muslims) from neighboring
Bangladesh seems to have stemmed
from a socio-economic struggle for
survival between native Indians and
illegal aliens. India's “policy of
secularism" has little to do with the
event. The Reuters news agency
quoted Mihir Muk,herjee‘s dispatch
which said that clashes in Gohpur,
Darrang and several other places in
Assam were initiated by both sides
(Lalung and Bodo tribesmen and
illegal aliens for Bangladesh

mainly Bengali speaking Muslims).

compete for the favors of each
consumer.

The greater the competition, the
more likely overproduction will lead
to depression. Today’s competitors
are, in part capitalists,‘in part social-
ists, in part monarchists, in part
members of other ideologies. Pri-
vate and public loans have been
extended by all sorts of banks to all
sorts of borrowers, in northern,
southern, eastern and western
hemispheres.

If current problems are not trace-
able to any one ideology, neither can
a solution be found wholly within

any one ideology. Organizationally,
capitalism and socialism are much
more similar than different, even if it
can be admitted that since “second
stage socialism,” or “ultimate” com-
munism, never has been described
very well or attempted anywhere,
nobody can say anything definitive
about it.

With two largely-similar systems
seeking to dominate each other, the
victory of either could not be
expected to change very much. True,
World War III may be the result if
capitalists and socialists do not soon
learn that it is time to invent some-
thing quite different from both.

tine Of Violence

It is widely reported that both the
Assamese, numbering about 32,000,
and the Bengalis, numbering about
50,000, have sought refuge from the
violence in the neighboring states of
Arunachal Pradesh and West
Bengal. i

As an Indian with an insight into
the current turmoil in Assam, I am
convinced that the reasons for the
Assam massacre are rooted in socio-
economic factors and have little to
do with political policy. Hence, they

can hardly be explained in terms of
the “philosophy of non-violence and
tolerance.”

While I agree with the writer-
“something must be done to stop
this quotidian routine ofviolence"~
I assert that the events in Assam
should not merely be interpreted as
an instance of the failure ofthe pol-
icy of secularism.

Covering Up Decades Of Mismanagement

Dear Editor: .

The question of the effect of imports on
the U.S. economy has raised interest in
many public circles. Executives at U.S. Steel
have been using the issue of imports as a
justification for-their demands that steel-_
workers accept lower wages and reduced
benefits. In many cases, after making even
these concessions to the steel industry, steel-
workers have found themselves unem-
ployed. Entire towns have been shut down as
the economic base, the steel industry, has
moved on to greener pastures seeking non-
union labor.

In order to divert attention away from
decades of mismanagement and investment
in areas other than the production.of steel,
the steel industry has been telling its
,.mployees that the heart of the problem is
one of foreign imports.

One of the reasons nations such as Ger-
many and Japan have been so successful in
competing with U.S. industry is that they
have implemented advanced technology to
reduce the cost of production. While it may
be true that workers are paid less in direct
wages in these countries than they are in the
United States, it is also true that they enjoy
more extensive benefits from the company
at which they are employed such as empoy-
ment security, subsidized housing and, in

somecases, recreational facilities. . _
It is also true that American labor finds it

difficult to compete with workers in Taiwan,
South Korea and South Africa when it
comes to wages and benefits. If you compare

gﬁthe standard of living of U.S. workers

against that of workers in the above menti-
oned countries then U.S. workers are “over-
paid,” but to those who suggest that the
standard of living of U.S. workers should be
lowered in order to compete with, say, the
South African worker, one must ask if the
conditions facing South African labor is an

acceptable model for the future U.S. labor.

Other questions also come to mind. In
which country are the transnational corpo-
rations based that invest in the above men
tioned regimes? Which government supplies

military aid (direct or indirect) which keeps
such regimes in power?

Nor is it possible to ignore the increasing
investments by U.S. corporations in their
“foreign competition” ” instead of in the

Dear Editor:

I would like to repIy,Iate as it may

the abortion issue.

in the letter; one—~women are not
simply vessels for procreation, two-
having children is a matter of choice,
and three—sex and reproduction
have become two separate entities.
On these three points I must agree,
but the arguments in favor of abor-
tion are inconclusive and
inappropriate.

The authors contend correctly
that we live in an age of great per-
sonal freedom, but they must also
realize that with freedom comes
responsibility. If an individual
decides not to have children,
whether the individual is single or
married, than the individual should

insure that a pregnancy does not
occur. There are many contraceptive
devices on the market today, and if
an individual does not wish to
become pregnant, it is her responsi-
bility to take the proper precautions.
The use of abortion as an “after-
the-fact contraceptive" must cease.
If both males and females would i
take the responsibility to insure that
unwanted pregnancies do not occur,
then there would not be a need to
have abortions except in cases of
rape, incest or situations where the
life of the mother was in jeopardy.
It is inappropriate to say that
eliminating abortion except in cases
of rape _or incest would deny the
right of women to choose between
having children or not having child-

Imports of inexpensive items from coun-
tries where the pay scale and standard of
living for workers is low and union rights are
non-existent does have a dampening effect
on U.S. labor. This is not to say the foreign
labor is to be blamed nor that U.S. labor has
been too greedy in its demands. It certainly is
not to praise the “economic efficiency” of
repressive anti-labor regimes.

Let us focus our attention on those who
profit most, both from concessions made by
the U.S. work force and from supercxploita-
tion of labor abroad. It is not the industrial
worker but the industrial owner who proﬁts.

Lights Hurry

By LINDA HENRY

"Look, the birds are beginning to
fly away already. Swans or geese . . .
Dear birds, happy birds . . .,” says
Masha, the middle of the Three Sisters
in Anton Chekhov's drama, which is
being performed in Stephen Foster
Memorial Theatre through March
26. And so it goes, according to Baron
-Tusenbach, the birds ”go on flying no
matter how ‘many philosophers they
happen to have flying with them.”
These people, however, despite their
ambitious dreams and talk, never
leave the ground. But in the end, the
three sisters vow to "go on liv-
ing"...”to start our lives all over
again," and so there is hope.

One thing is certain, they love life,
or they would not be so despondent
with boredom. They just aren't quite

. brave enough to spread their wings,

and therein lies the fault with this
production.

It is a nice show. Many productions
of Three Sisters are pessimistic, but
director Gillette Elvgren went for a
lighter touch seeing the play as a
comedy. ”Chekhov never allows a
character to be taken too seriously,"
said Elvgren. ”They each have a comic
bubble to be pricked.”

This concept of ”lighthearted fun"
was apparent throughout as the cast
worked well both with and off of each
other. The actors were so believable
in their roles that there was a feeling
they were type-cast. Especially con-
vincing was Patricia Hicok, who
played a biting Natalya, the ”petty
bougeois housewife” married to
Andrei, brother of the three sisters.

The best performance was by
Maria Barney as Masha. It is a credit
to be able to play a person bored with
her life and not bore the audience but
stir its compassion instead. Barney
touches the audience even when she
is sitting, reading a book or laying on
a couch with her head in a pillow. Her
presence is the theme off of which
other characters bounce variations.

Douglas Krizner plays a heart-
wrenching, pitiful Andrei, and Mary-
Jo Kelly displays amazing energy as
Irina, the youngest sister, especially
for a mother of a one—month old
baby. (She has been in rehearsal since
before giving birth.)

Masha’s husband, Eyodor, the
bumbling fool, is lovingly portrayed
by Mark P. Stevenson, and Richard
Ewing and Steven Brown give fine
performances as Alexandr Vershinin
and Baron Nikolai Tusenbach,
respectively.

Two minor characters are worth
mentioning if only for their realistic
makeup. However, Rudi Kastelic as
Ferpont, watchman atithe District
Council, was wonderful as a deaf old
man and Lillian Miskow Coury's
Anfisa, an over-80-year-old servant,
never seemed like a minor character
when on stage.

Also not taking minor roles in this
production were the set and cos-
tumes. Henry Heymann designed the
beautiful, fragmented but realistic

se,t,u$in,g.authentic antique furnish-
*r_.‘.«‘,¢.”.,‘,e‘, ,4‘ or». 1 a «v m—,»««,~ u.-. an in wwv mm--< . a ma um - - v ~

' ings for a feel of naturalism. The

characters were not boxed in, which
is part of the point.

The magnificent period costumes
designed by Karen Anselm vMackes
were practically the stars of the
show. Everyone was praising them.
There were 15 characters with over
40 luscious costumes, most built
from scratch.

Despite all this prettiness, there is
something emotional missing. Like
viewing a good artist paint a copy of a
masterpiece, we are left with some-
thing nice but not different, with no
individual meaning. Masha expresses
this feeling best: ”How can you live
and not know why the cranes fly,

why children are born, why the stars \

shine in the sky!...You must either

' know why you live, or else...nothing

m,atters...everything’s just wild
grass....”

CQUSADE

BERLIN/SWEET OLIVE
Stanley Theater
March 10, 1983

By RICHARD SATER

than the five—man/one-woman group
from Los Angeles, but the ‘re doing
their best to remedy the situation.
They're “currently on tour to promote
their recently released debut album,
Pleasure Victim. But "Victim" is hardly
an appropriate tag for anyone who
heard Berlin's pleasureable concert at
the Stanley on Thursday.

Berlin's men, elegant in tuxedos
and heavy with makeup and hairs-
pray, hit the stage first, followed by
lead vocalist Terri Nunn—who
looked striking in red with a black
lace hat riding sidesaddle, her blonde
hair apparently combed with a
blender. The red stuff on her arms
and right leg was dripped paint.
"Masquerade" and "The Metro," two
of the group's best, kicked things off
and set the pace for the 75-minute
set—a highly stylized show, invigo-
rating and frenetic.

Drummer Rod Learned provided
excellent beat, grinning demonically
throughout; he's the only one who let
the audience in on the fun he was
having. David Diamond and John
Crawford both played synthesizers
and were occasionally featured on
guitar, with Crawford also sharing

guitar and Matt Reid on synthesizer
provided the remaining third of
Berlin.

Nunn’s voice was incredible:
defiant and powerful at times, little
lost girl or delicious cat's purr at oth-
ers. She stalked and prowled with
feline grace, caressing the micro-
phone as she sang. She established an
informal rapport with the audience.

Plenty of new material was mixed
in along with the songs the audience
came to hear. The new stuff was par,

mostly, numbers like ”Picture of
You" and "When We Make Love."
Some of it was fantastic——”Touch and
Co," dedicated to the one-night
stand, had a marvelous carnival—like
feel. Berlin offered glossy, vivid
musicianship; effective use of "real"
instruments (guitars and drums)
along with the synthesizers height-
ened the music's emotional pitch.

Midway through, Nunn left the
stage,» returning in pink tights that
lived up to their name and a loosely-
structured white blouse. "Talk To
Me" and "Tell Me Why," two of the
evening's highlights, followed.
"What else do you want?" asked
Nunn at the end. S‘

”Sex!" yelled the audience, and
they got it; the live version of "Sex
(I'm a...)," their current single, a duet
by Nunn and Crawford which fea-
tured visual passion-play accompani-
ment. It was the climax (excuse me)
of the show and its standout, accord-
ing to audience reaction. Two
encores followed, including the
namesake, "Dancing in Berlin.” Hard
to find fault with any of it; Berlin
proved themselves an ideal live band,
offering exciting and noticeably
embellished versions of their album
material instead of merely parrot—like
covers. They can definitely do with-
out some of the Devo—like robotics,
though.

The opener, Sweet Olive, is a new
local organization, a four-man group
topped by Deborah Faryl, a singer
with plenty of talent. She displayed
her range for the moderately appreci-
ative crowd, holding visual interest-
fishnet tights, red tiger-striped silk
dress, black gloves and bushy blonde
hair—-and keeping busy throughout
their 50-minute set. Faryl's voice is
powerful and well controlled; she's
got the Pat Benatar-ish crying edge
and authority that commands
attention.

The rest of the band adopted a
rather typical (or is it required?)
facade-bored expressions, vivid out-
fits and punky makeup, but they're a
tight group, not radically new, but
entirely satisfactory. They played
their own material—mostly upbeat,
new—wavish pop and rather good,
too, especially "Cut Right Through"
and "Pigment of My Imagination."
It's all united and carried by Faryl's
singing.

They closed things with the lament
”City Life" and ‘an overlong instru-
mental, ”Backwash," that still offered
some nice solo opportunities for
Kenny Palino on bass, Ron Brown on
lead guitar, Paul Brouwn on key-

boards and Philip Christ on drums. It

led into their final number, "I Don't
Care" (the title doesn't reflect their
approach to music). There are good
possibilities here.

IGGY POP
March 14, 1983
Stanley

I By DAVID JONES

Iggy Pop has lived his entire adult
life with Rock on his mind and in his
blood; coming in his ears and out his
mouth. Iggy exists for Rock, in Rock
and by Rock, and he knows it. He's
well aware of Rock's capacity to
extend his persona beyond the boun-
daries of his person, of Rock's ena-
bling a forceful insertion of his
self-awareness into the mass con-
sciousness and of the intense ego-
extension allowed by a Rock
performance: a contextual existence,
separate from himself but nonethe-
less alive by virtue of the audience.

Iggy has been performing Rock
since 1966, when he was known as
James Osterberg, drummer for the
Iguanas in his hometown of Detroit.
But it wan't until he got together
with Ron and Scott Ashton and Dave
Alexander that Iggy Pop came alive to
the world fronting the seminal punk
band, The Stooges.

lggy’s work with the Stooges is
outstanding in its extreme awareness
of the sexual nature of Rock perfor-
mance. The concert hall is the bed-
room, the show a big bang. lggy’s

' three albums with the Stooges--The

Stooges, Funhause and Raw Power--went
further in realizing the sexual poten-
tial of Rock than anything that had
yet been produced.

Iggy opened the show with one of
those "old" songs, "Loose," from Fun-
house ("I'm gonna stick it deep inside,
cuz I'm loose") and the fuses in the
Stanley blew out 30 seconds into the
song. After "Loose," Iggy did three
cuts from The Idiot, the first of two
albums he recorded with David
Bowie in Berlin in 1977: "Mass Pro-
duction," "Funtime," and "Nightclub-
bing," all filled with extreme cynicism
towards common social behavior,
obviously reflective of his experien-
ces in life and with Rock.

Following the Idiot set, he did a sur-
prise (for me) medley of "96 Tears"
and "I'm Waiting For My Man." He
followed this with "Eat or Be Eaten"

(his favorite rave-up), ”Sixteen"
(from Lust for Life), and ”Raw Power,”
the title track to the most intense
album of all time came next. He fol-
lowed this with ”The Villagers” and
”Street Crazies,” both from Zombie,
after which he let someone fromthe
audience jump around on stage and
yell into the mike for a minute. (Get
it? it's a cruel joke!)

This signalled the breakdown of A

the conditioned performer/audience
barrier: shit started flying at Iggy
from the audience, Iggy insulted and
then spit at (and got spit back at by)
people in the front, sang ”Cock in My
Pocket," got hit in the face with a cup
full of beer and insulted the audience

some more. Having thus enriched the \

audience with a full-blown load of his
hate, Iggy, along with the band, who
provided the loud, hard, fast backing
that Iggy demands, did a vicious
”Bang—,Bang/' his ode to the Ameri-
can way of life (”Lonely! Who? Me?
Bang-Bang!”), dropped the mike,
picked up and smashed one of the

’ guitars and walked off stage. The

lights came on, the roadies came out,
and we all went home.

SOUTHSIDE JOHNNY & THE
ASBURY JUKES

March 15, 1983

Stanley Theatre

By TODD ERKEL

Some celebrations, such as wakes,
proceed against a grain of undeniable
tragedy. Some concerts, such as this,
proceed despite the empty seats.

There would be no corporate
splash tonight; no free posters of the
Jukes popping open their favorite
beer or soft drink, no fancy lighting,
no souped up staging. Only the
natives showed up tonight. Oh, there
were a few prep-college types there,
home on spring break and fired up to
see "Bruce Springsteen's friend,” but
for the most part, these were people
who lived lives brewing of the same
mixed-up parts—lonesome blues,
angry rock and joyous pop—that
”the Joooks” use in their music.

One blink of the eye and the crystal
chandeliers and brass railings of this
magestic theater vanished, replaced
by the sight of John Lyon, dishe-
velled, unfashionable and badly pos-
tured, hair flopping around his dark
shades and sweat dripping down his
neck before the first notes were sung.

Loose is the only word to describe
this band, and at one time,that was a
surpreme compliment, but their per-
formance tonight and that of this
past summer bordered upon being
unprofessional. Lyon can get away
with it, with anything, because he's
the quintessential punk. He can
insult an audience with more genuine
love than any performer around
today. But more is expected from the
band, and in the earlier years, it was
delivered. The departure of Ed Man-
ion and Richard ”La Bamba" Rosen-
berg, the most stylish and adept of
the "Miami Horns," further deplete
the Jukes, who have never fully reco-
vered from the loss of guitarist Joel
Gramolini two years ago.

The crowd, small in number but
enthusiastic nonetheless, stood

screaming by the third song, ”alk To

,Me," but Southside had beaten them

to the punch; he was mugging and
flailing his body around the stage
eight bars into the opener. ”I Don't
Want To Go Home" came early on
with a couple of new songs, including
the bouncy "I Can't Live Without
Love,” which on first listen had com-
mercial possibilities. Lyon pretty
much summed uphis approach to life
after treating the crowd to an ear-
wrenching, guitar solo lead-in to
”The Fever.” Unsuccessful in his
attempt at feedback, Lyon dropped
the instrument, grabbed the mike
and said, ”Fuck it."

"Trapped Again” and ”Vertigo’
drove Lyon and his audience over the
edge, the lyrics of the latter-
”spinning, and turning, round I
go,”—-only beginning to capture his
movements which ended in a James
Brown-like collapse to the stage
floor. Lyon somehow goes on, spin-
ning turning, falling, joking, empty
seats or not, record label or not, not a
man possesed, just a fool having a
good -time.

The strains of the perennial close-
out, ”Having A Party,” rang out the
night with good cheer, but beneath
thechanting chorus could be heard
the sound of despair. The Jukes are a
dying breed, a band looked upon as
archaic but actuallyahead of its time.
The "new wave" of bands and music
fans boast a defiant, cross-racial
approach to their music forgetting
that it was Lyon and others like him
who embodied as much in a more
stoic time. No, Southside Johnny &
The Asbury Jukes haven't adapted
well to changing times. Maybe
they've been there all along..,.

 
MICHAEL STANLEY BAND
Syria Mosque
March 10, 1983

I

By FRANK DIGIACOMO

Those who were not aware of the
Michael Stanley Band before their
1980 Heartland tour may have mis-
taken last Thursday's concert at the
Mosque as a good one. However,
those who found themselves remi-
niscing about the band's Stage Pass
(arguably their best album) days were
probably extremely disappointed,
bored or both.

Albeit, the music industry has not
been kind to the Michael Stanley
Band. During 1978 and 1979, when
the band was producing its sharpest
material, it was dropped by its Epic
label—-who hardly promoted. the
band. Two albums later, the group
wandered» onto EMI and came up
with Heartland, an album that showed
promise and even put MSB on the
charts with ”Lover” and ”He Can't
Love You." Unfortunately, the aroma
of success convinced Stanley to cling
to the safety of AOR formulae, which
resulted in Northcoast and MSB—two
poor imitations of Seger’s Against The
Wind.

As usual, the Pitt student turnout
for the concert was dismal, with
probably no more than 900 attend-
ing. Moreover, the lethargic attitude
of the audience and the disinterested
performance by the band mixed to
cause a chain reaction of yawns and
rustling seats.

Still, there was not much of an
excuse for MSB's limp performance.
’’In The Heartland" was a good choice
for an opener, but its execution failed
to generate any galvanic response
from the crowd. The band members

seemed fragmented—-everyone was
playing competently, but there was
no group unity. Consequently, gui-
tarist Gary Markasky’s trademark
frenetic solos ended up coming across
as bizarre displays of virtuosity while
Stanley himself seemed too con-

cerned with his heterosexuality to -

worry about the group's perfor-
mance. '

The set was largely taken from the
Heartland, Northcoast, and MSB albums
with a smattering of tunes from Cabin
Fever, Greatest Hints, and Stage Pass. The
set reached a peak during the Stage
Pass versions of ”Let’s Get the Show
on the‘ Road" and "Midwest
Midnight"—the group's best song
which, ironically, deals with the
struggle to make it in Rock-n-Roll
land. It was here that Stanley seemed
to regain some of the fire of his
yesteryears—until he spoiled the lat-
ter song with a Springsteenish rap
that dampened the anger of this, the

 

band's former anthem.

The show was average from there
until "Lover” and ”He Can't Love
You” revived the snoozing audience
and compelled them to bring MSB
back for an encore performance of
their usual ”Strike Up The Band."
This gave keyboardist Bob Pelander,
one of the MSB originals, a chance to
prove his voice is better than key-
boardistlvocalist Kevin Raleigh's and
the rest of the group an opportunity
to re-bore the just-awakened crowd
with bass, drum and guitar solos.

Frankly, it was rather easy to leave
after the encore, and nobody else
seemed concerned with bringing out
the band again. In fact, the band prob-
ably felt the same way. This was a
clear-cut case in which both parties
were guilty: the Michael Stanley
Band for a terribly average show and
the audience for letting them get
away with it. '

When the Jackson Five busted

smash "ABC," the group
offered a sound that's simplicity
was rivalled only by its
infectiousness—slick harmony
and simple lyrics that caused
more sprained ankles and groin
injuries than an episode of Soul

more than 10 years later, the

Michael, has made the truly
exciting Thriller with the same

True, Michael Jackson has
grown up. His album portrait

his baby face and castrato tenor

revealed more so in Thriller's lyr-

messages, letting the listener
come back to the songs’ mean-
ings only after he has stopped
dancing.

Chronologically, Thriller is the
logical follow-up to Off The Wall.
While the previous album was a
glossy product of the hedonis-
tic, late '70s disco period, Thriller
shows some of the concern of
the '80s in addition to the
numerous musical styles that
have evolved. Synthesizers per-
meate the entire album, there is
a rap track by none other than
Vincent Price on "Thriller," and
the searing guitar of Eddie Van
Halen makes "Beat It" smolder
with rock-n-roll. Despite its
radio overkill, even ”The Girl Is
Mine" emphasizes an '80s play-
fulness in Jackson's duet with
Paul McCartney instead of
exploiting the song's transcend-
ence of racial music barriers (as
did "Ebony and Ivory").

Moreover, Thriller has the
same smooth sound, infectious
melodies and high-gloss pro-

duction that Off The Wall

coming from; is Modern English
trying to be a cross between the
Psychedelic Furs and Echo and
the Bunneymen, or, are they
just trying to be themselves?
After an earful of After The Show,
I'll opt for the latter.

Modern English is an
extremely smooth band who
seem to be creating music that
recreates life's "more reflective
moments. Cerebral, yet not
arty, they create mood pieces
that fit together like frames of
film. The songs don't run
together so much as they follow

offered. Fortunately, however,
Quincy Jones manages not to
overproduce Jackson as he did
Donna Summer on her last
album. Thriller’s production and
direction is attractively sweet
but not overbearingly rich. Jack-
son has written -and arranged
the best songs, most notably
"Billie Jean" and "Beat It," while
Rod Temperton, though at
times a little sappy, has found
Jackson's style of song with
"Thriller” and "The Lady In My
Life" to mention two.

While the album's music
makes it irresistibly danceable,
it is Jackson's voice that makes
Thriller so unquestionably list-
enable. There is nothing
smoother than his candied
tenor stylings and, on this

one another in "precise order,
making subtle comments, but
rarely judgments, about the
subjects they choose to write
about.
The music itself is subtle, but
there is a churning urgency to
its rhythms that belies the calm
surface. ”I Melt With You," for
example, sounds like an
extremely beautiful love song at
first; but beneath this exterior is
a song about love between the
races and the comment that
"l’ve seen the changes, but it's
getting better all the time." A
* hopeful song, in fact, which
echoes the sentiments of the
majority of the album's other
material.

a rock—n-roll swagger on ”Beat

falter and only serve to fortify
this musical confection. '

Thriller is no great exodus
from Off The Wall or a carbon
copy of it. It is a fantastic album
by an artist who has grown so
very much since his childhood
days with the Jackson Five.
However, through all of this
maturation, Jackson has kept
with him a quality that is so
abundant in children and so evi-
dent on this album—-—the ability
to please.

the same, but people like them.

NO MAN'S LAND
Lene Lovich ,
Stiff/Epic ,
Lene Lovich, she of the
braided, skigslope hair-dos and
space-age ethnic clothes, is
really not all that weird. Her
appearance and her bizarre in-
concert performances might
lead you to think that she's an
inaccessible art-type who has no

' concern for the whims of record

buyers. But, while she's highly
original and there's no question
that advanced stages of creativ-
ity are going on in her mind,
Lovich obviously cares whether

or not people are going to pay I
‘cold, hard cash for her efforts.

Why else would she release No
Man's Land?

No Man's Land is much better
than last year's New Toy, which
wasn't representative of
Lovich's considerable talents.
This time around, she's taken a
much lighter approach; the pro-
duction is simple and clear
(Lovich and her right arm,‘Les
Chapell, with remix help by Bob
Clearmountain), centerin_g
around Lovich's strong, reson-
ant vocals-—a wise choice. The
music is haunting but rollicking
fun nonetheless—another
Lovich forte. The first single off
the LP, "It's You, Only You
(Mein Schmerz)," for example,
is oh—so—madly dramatic but
done so broadly (you can just
imagine Lovich standing center
stage, arms flailing like Dutch
windmills) that it's funny.

There's an abundance of top-
notch material on this disc—-
”Sister Video," "Blue Hotel,"
"Maria " etc.—and considering
it's all quite accessible, there's
only one thing out of place: why
is it Called No Man's Land?

Selleck FliesOnto\
The Silver Screen

By RICHARD SATER

I All right, all right—Tom Selleck is
so damned appealing that it's nearly
impossible to dislike High Road To
China. It's his starring debut in a
theatrical release, and it's a mixture
of adventure, excitement, intrigue,
romance and improbability set in
192.0. Seems to me I've heard that
song before, but it hasn't been sung‘
exactly like this for years.

He's Patrick O’Malley, described
with adequate vagueness as "some
kind of war hero,” an ace pilot and
displaced American in Istanbul since
the Armistice. O’Malley has two rick-
ety biplanes, and he's available for
flying lessons or liasons. He smokes
cigars doesn't shave often and drinks
a lot, but "he's all right in any condi-
tion," according to his faithful
mechanic, Struts (Jack Weston).

Bess Armstrong is Eve Tozer,
O’Malley’s opposition. She's a rich,
devil-may-care cool blonde——"the
society dame," as he refers to her.
Intrigue: Several years ago, Eve's
father disappeared into Afghanistan,
and now Bentik (Robert Morley), the
unscrupulous business partner,
wants Mr. Tozer declared legally
dead. In the event of death, the
unnamed business transfers to Ben-
tik, and Eve is given 12 days to prove
her father is alive or she will lose her
considerable bank account. Natu-,
rally, Bentik wants to prevent a reun-

ion, and that just about connects all
the plot angles.

Anyway and fortunately, Eve
needs a plane to get to Afghanistan,
and she seeks out O’Malley. Romance
puts its best traditional foot forward:
it's hate at first sight, as he calls her "a
rich, spoiled brat...with more money
than sense” when she offers him
30,000 pounds to fly with her. He's "a
man of principle," refusing until she
doubles the amount. O’Malley dis-
covers what sort of deal he's arranged
when Eve proves herself an equally
proficient (and always sober) pilot.

The high road in the title refers to
the sky; O’Malley, Eve and Struts fly
out of Istanbul, heading vaguely
toward Afghanistan. Mr. Tozer isn't
there, though, and the search con-
tinues through Nepal and the Hima-
layas. En route to father, they
encounter a tribe of hostile natives
and O’Malley is forced into an excit-
ing aerial dogfight. They never have
trouble getting petrol I for the
machines, and Eve and O’Malley’s
relationship develops along the usual
lines; hate moves to tolerance, camar-
aderie and concern. Bentik's pursuit
of Eve is entirely forgettable,
although random shots of his annoy-
ance and his methods are shoehorned
into the business.

The actual pursuit of dad obliter-
ates the reasons behind it; after the
traditional wild goose chase——-"he's
not here?"—they run into him (Wil-

Swcase, riday March 1'8. 1983

’ ford Brimley) beyond the Himalayas.

"Daddy! What the hell are you doing
out here in the middle of China?"
asks Eve. The flimsy ploy framework
collapses by the end of the film, as
O’Malley and Eve find themselves
involved in love and a climactic battle

. between a Chinese warlord and the

local peasantry (led by Mr. Tozer).

Heroes and villians are blacked-
and—whitewashed. There's no grey in
between to deter our sympathies.
Unreal luck, adventure and breath-
less escapes unfold cheerfully, and it's
all punctuated by John Barry's Max
Steiner-ish musical score, with a nice

Selleck and Armstrong get along
with screen-team efficiency, and
their slowly and inevitably dawning
attraction is deliciously worked out
through games, name-calling and
stolen kisses. In direct descendence
from their forefathers, the sex is left
neatly to imagination.

Selleck couldn't have requisitioned
a better vehicle for his first solo
flight. He is cast into with type;
O’Malley’s nicely vulgar, unshaven
character rather drips with naive and
unharnessed sensuality—the ideal
fantasy hero-lover. Selleck is perhaps
best without long stretches of dia-
logue, but his is an entirely ingratiat-
ing performance that can only add to

'The House On

By BRENDAN BE-ARY’

The movie poster for The House on
Sorority Row has the caption, "Nothing
can prepare you for what happens
when she fights back." If that mis-
leads you into expecting a film of Car-
rie quality, you're in for a surprise;
nothing can prepare you for the stu-
pidity of the next 90 minutes.

Horror films have never been
heavy on the gray matter, but this
one wears its stupidity like a crown.
I'll save you $4.00 and quickly outline
the plot: The girls of a sorority decide,
as a last blast, to play a prank on the
evil, half-mad housemother. Rather
than kids’ stuff like pennying her
door, they decide some fun with a
‘Luger. is in order. Of course, there's
one live bullet in the round, and poor
Mrs. Slater, despite the girls’
attempts at mouth-to-mouth (that
works for bullet wounds, doesn't it?),
buys the farm. Does anyone call the

the myth. He's Errol Flynn and Gary
Cooper and Clark Cable and, quite
possibly, next in line to be matinee
idol.

Bess Armstrong is lovely, elegant
and never disheveled; her-‘faucet
charm is well-controlled and she's a
proper, spoiled, I-don't-care girl. Her
dialogue works somewhat against
the effectiveness of it—she could be
hard—boiled without mouthing "shit"

and "son of a bitch." It's difficult at ya

times to feel the entire and necessary
sympathy for her, and it clashes with
1920—according to the movies, girls
just didn't talk that way.

The film was shot on location in
England and Yugoslavia, and the
nature is beautiful. The aerial photo-
graphy is exciting, and Brian Hut-
ton’s direction is always servicea-
ble—nothing surprising, but the
picture is refreshing and upbeat, pay-
ing homage to all those old adventure
movies about airplanes and pilots and
romance. High Road to China empties

the Hollywood box of stock parts andm

characters, but it's all done with
genuine fondness and good humor.
For all its inadequacies, there's plea-
sant entertainment here, so sincere
that it even avoids parody. Suspen-
sion of belief is absolutely essential
and perhaps there's nothing new
here except Tom Selleck on the big
screen, but High Road to China is fun
and an irresistible souvenir.

party that night! So they throw her in
the scum-infested pool for the time

pool?). _
Well, unknown to the girls, Mrs.
Slater had a brain-damaged child
who's been living in the attic for 20
years who finally decides it's time to
get out and see the world. Alas, the
first thing he sees is Mom taking the
long count, which gets little Eric very
angry. And so the fun begins.

And if it's stupid dialogue you'reﬁ

after, try this: one of the girls sur-
vives an initial attack and runs back to
the house with huge bloody gashes all
over only to be asked by one of her
sisters, "Did somebody do this to
you?”

Writer and director Mark Rosman
has touched all the bases of the
horror-film genre: the Introductory
Flashback, the Fatal Accident, the
Terrible Secret, the Bevy of Svelte
Nymphs who bide their time until
they cash in their chips, and the Ivory
Girl Who Survives (Kathryn
McNeil). The only problem is that,
despite all the right parts, nothing
happens. There is really nothing new

about this film—not even any new.

ways of knocking people off. There
are a few genuinely scary scenes, but
balanced against the plodding script
and some of the most childishly-
constructed hallucination sequences
since the ’60s acid films, the viewer
still gets short-changed.

The best thing to be said about this
film is that, aside from Eileen David-
son in one of the hokiest lovemaking
scenes ever, it resists the temptation
of gratuitous sexploitation of some
nubile starlets. But it was the hint of
that orgiastic romping that brought
in most -of the audience. If you can
find anyone who wasn't disappointed
by this film, don't give him directions
to Amos Hall.

Sue Heon achieved All-

America status in two events
‘while Jan Ujevich failed to qual-
’ify for the final l2 during the first

day of the NCAA National

Women's Swimming Champion-

ships held at the University of

Nebraska.

Heon earned All-America
honors in the 500-yard freestyle
and t_he 200-yard backstroke, the
third consecutive year she
received this status. Her time of
2:04.14 in the backstroke event
established a new Lady Panther

record and broke her own per-
sonal best time by over two
seconds.

The junior from Clark Sum-
mit, Pa., finished eleventh in the
preliminaries in the freestyle
event with a time of 4:5 1 .9. Heon
could finish as high as seventh in
the nation in both events.

Meanwhile, Ujevich failed to
finish in the top 12 in the 200-
yard individual medley, finishing
with a time of 2210.5.

Both Heon and Ujevich were
seeded high in their respective
events, which means they have to
swim in the first heat and wait

until all the qualifying heats are
finished in order to find out if
they had made it into the top 12
spots.

“Swimming in the first heat is
definitely a disadvantage,”
Coach David Belowich said. “It
forces you to swim against the
clock instead of the competition.

“Then you have to sit and wait
for the other heats to finish. Your
times become the target for the
other swimmers."

According to Belowich, the
only thing Heon and Ujevich can
do in this situation is work
harder.

“They have to push as hard as
they can," he said. ‘

This situation may have kept
Ujevich out of the finals in her
event.

“It wasn't the most ideal set-
ting," Belowich said. "But both
Jan and Sue know what they
have to do, and they have been
doing a good job. Unfortunately,
J an’s time wasn't good enough to
hit the top 12.”

Ujeich will still have an oppor-
tunity to earn her fourth consec-
utive All-America honor as she
still has to swim in the 100-yard
individual medley, while Heon is

Early in the competition,

ing for the team championship,
while Pitt is the only Eastern
team scoring points.

Meanwhile, a new national
record has been set. Tammy
Thomas of Kansas broke the 50-
yard freestyle mark witha time
of 22.28, over a second ahead of

by Jill Sterkel of Texas, who also *

This is a team that could be
suffering from what might be
termed mental anguish, more
commonly known as burnout.
The Panther volleyball squad
was a prime candidate for this
condition when it tuned its car-
buretor for an Indy-500 start of a
season.

The Panthers’ first four week-
ends meant three pressure-
packed days of best-of-three and
best-of-five matches. They were
grueling matches that could have
thrown this roster—revealing six
freshmen out of l0—-into an irre-
versible tailspin. V

It could have, -but nothing
resembling a disaster of that
magnitude ever surfaced. That’s
why coach Ray Reilly is grateful

x for split seasons. The division

appears every year, this season
being no different. The first part
begins in late January and usu-
ally extends through the dark
recesses of February.

Phase ll begins now—as it has
traditionally—and endures until
Eastern Championships arrive.
Had it not been for a three-week
hiatus the Panthers journeyed on
since their last match against
Rutgers-—Newark, Feb. 26, their
current l3-8-l match record
could conceivably show how fast
a team can plummet to earth
when dealing with so few veteran
players.

By CHARLIE O'HARA

Over the last three-and-a-half
months, Pitt has been a witness
to the resurgence of the Panther
track program, one that had
gone through some pretty lean
years prior to the arrival of new
coach John Vasvary, who came
to Pitt in September from
Virginia.

Before the '82-'83 campaign
began, the team had some basic
goals: “We wanted to build a
foundation, begin a new.tradi-
tion,“ coach Steve Lewis said.

“We wanted to be competitive,
but we weren't sure how good we
were going to be," Vasvary said.
“We did have one ultimate goal
as a team, and that was to win the
Big East conference title. We
didn't win, but we gave it a heck-
uva shot.“

They weren't sure how good
they were because they hadn't
run a race yet. The season
opened Dec. 4 at the West Vir-
ginia lnvitational, which was to
have been an “observation eval-

/ uation" meet. The Panthers dis-
covered a quality hurdler in
sophomore transfer Darryl
Shepherd.

The second meet ofthe season
was at the George Mason Christ-
mas lnvitational. where the

long assault on the Pitt record
book.

/

But Reilly has done a fairly
credible job to date. He should

continue doing so when the .

Panthers play host to three dis-
trict teams tomorrow at Trees
Hall for a round-robin tourna-
ment. Edinboro, Duquesne arid
Robert Morris will all face Pitt
with the first match scheduled to
start at 10 a.m.

The latter two programs are
struggling thrugh their first year
and should pose no problem for
the fifth-year Panthers. Edin-
boro has already been defeated
by Pitt this season in three
straight games and should pro-
vide little competition for the
Panthers.

Reilly scheduled the round-
robin only several weeks ago
since he had some open dates in
March and probably saw the
need for some competition
before the team travels to ever-
Happy Valley for a Penn State
encounter on Monday evening.

“It's nothing exciting, really,”
Reilly said in anticipation of
tomorrow's matches. “The main
reason we’re playing them is that
the freshmen need the competi-
tion to gain some more
confidence.”

That's been Reilly's utmost
concern all year-——trying to instill
necessary collegiate experience
into players only accustomed to
high school volleyball. Lately,
Reilly added some new flavor
into his Baskin-Robbins playset

Junior Todd Colas ran a
NCAA qualifying 1,000-meter
run, destroying the field and set-
ting the school record. Brian Pol-
lock broke the school record in
the 400-meter dash while fresh-
man teammate Rich Baderinwa
did likewise in the 300-meter
dash.

“We found out that [Mario]
Joyner and Pollock could run
the hurdles and that Todd is as
tough as they come,” Vasvary
said. “We also discovered that
Terry Gallagher had speed that
we didn't think he had."

After a month of training, the
Panthers traveled to the campus

of East Tennessee State for the
Eastman Kodak lnvitational.

“At the Kodak meet, Roger
Kingdom proved that he is a
bona fide national class hurdler,"
Vasvary said. “We found out
about Ricky Asberry in the short
sprints and Mario Joyner in the
quarter mile. Bob Buczkowski
made- his first appearance and
showed~~,,that he was a definite
contendei for the Big East
competition.

A week later, the Panther
sprinters and jumpers traveled to
Ohio State. “We took our sprint-
ers and jumpers. Roger high

jumped 6-l0 I/4 and we realized
that he would be very important

strategy. He calls it a 6-2 offense,
temporarily replacing the tradi-
tional 5-l offense.

It also temporarily replaces
two-time All-East setter Dave
Baird, who only saw action in
one game of Pitt's four-game vic-
tory over the Colonials on Tues-
day. The other three times, Reilly
used middle hitters Tony Zortea
and Barry Goldberg as the two

The prestige and pomp of the
world-renowned Wanamaker-
Millrose Games was next on the
agenda for the Panthers.

Though Kingdom was not
admitted in the 60-yard hurdle
field, the two-mile relay team
made the trip and, except for an
excellent effort by Todd Colas
(l:49.7), ran into disaster. It was
the only meet where the Panthers
couldn't handle the pressure.
They had only 24 hours to shake
it off.

The following evening, the
same five members (Kingdom,
Colas, Gallagher, Darren Geary
and Garland Brown) traveled to
Louisville for the Mason-Dixon
Games.

setters. e

In the 6-2, there are always
three hitters up front with one
setter in the back and one in the
front. Both then rotate as play
continues.

“We'll always have three hit-
ters when using the 6-2,” Reilly
explained. “It gets more away
from the 5-! where deception
plays a key role. The last time we

Kingdom was defeated by Wil-
lie Gault (soon to be NCAA 60-
yard hurdle and dash champ) by
a tenth of a second.

The two-mile relay team
rebounded after the previous
night's disappointment by breez-
ing to victory, defeating the Ca-
nadian National Team handily.

Finally, it was time to enter the
entire team. The Panthers trav-
eled south to the VMI Winter
Relays.

“We put it all together [second
place, 84 points—losing only to a
verysound VMI team] and beat
some outstanding teams——N.C.
State, the ACC champs; Geor-
gia, the SEC runner-ups; South
Carolina and Virginia," Vasvary

used the 6-2 offense was when
Mike Hebert was here [1978-79].‘
The 5-1 has been used ever since
‘Chubby’ [Baird] came along.”
Reilly is experimenting with
the 6-2 since the Panthers are in
the midst of playing more of the
weaker-type teams. Both Zortea
and Goldberg, Reilly admitted,
“aren’t setters per se," but the
Panthers can run more small
plays off this type offense. The
5-1 will be resurrected again
when Pitt travels to Penn State.
There ‘are certain advantages
inherent when’ using the 6-2
offense, Reilly said.‘ .
“You get a whole different tim
ing sequence. The setters show
different traits, bringing about
different responses [by the hit-

, ters]. With the 5-1, you can get

used to one setter.

“But with two setters, one has
to work with certain hitters while
the other has his own hitters to
work with,” Reilly said. “In fact,
it often makes for double work in
practice. The freshmen, though,
have integrated well with the new
offense. They're gaining
experience.” .-

Indeed, the squad's record
undoubtedly belies that fact.
That in mind, the start of Reilly's
second season tomorrow could
realistically bring about a team
more likely to play above .500
than the team which struggled
through the first half of the
season.

said. “Everyone realized that
every step was important. We
became a team.”

The shuttle hurdle relay team
set the school record while King-
dom broke the Field House
record previously held by Rich-
mond Flowers, one of the great-
est hurdlers of all time. Kingdom ’
was named the meet‘s outstand-
ing performer.

Next for the Panthers was the
I-lardee‘s classic at W.V.U.

Gallagher set the school
record in the 800-meter run.
Moorhead proved his worth in
the l,000-meter run.

Pitt mei.’s tennis coach George
Dieffenba .h plans to start this year's
season wi.h| a change of strategy.

“Last year we ended up 7-7 on the
year because we came back to win
six of our last seven matches," Dief-
fenbach said. “We don't want to
have to resort to that again this year.
We want a very fast start and consis-
tency throughout the season."

fenbach achieve his goal are his
team's dedication and Mother

Nature.

“The team has worked hard since
we placed fifth at the Big East tour-
nament last fall," Dieffenbach said.
“We've lifted and run all winter, and
we've had a lot of good fortune with
the weather the last month. The
weather has helped a lot because we
could play outside a lot more. That’s
something we've never really had
before."

With a tougher-than-usual sched-
ulgthat includes Middle States Ten-

teams such as Penn State, West Vir-

nis AssociEitioii'i'(MSTA)‘V Toff ’l0"‘"

ginia and California State, Dief-
fenbach will have to depend heavily
on experience to produce a winning
season. .
“Our No. l, 2, 3 and 4 players are

definitely strong, while our No. 5,

and 6 are relatively untested,” he
said. “We're confident with our high’
positions on the team. Whether we
can compete with the stronger com-
petition depends on the perfor-
mance of our lower positions."

could double in the 60-yard hur-
dles and dash,” Vasvary said.

The team was then to face the
stiff competition of the Big East
Conference meet. The Panthers
performed about as well as
possible.

“Everybody did the best they
could. The guys took pride in
being a part of the team. We
gained respectability,” Vasvary
said.

Kingdom was again named
outstanding performer for his
efforts in the high jump and the
55-meter high hurdles. Pollock
set the meet record in the 300-
meter dash. Colas was unbeata-
ble in the l,000-meter run while
manipulating Vi1lanova’s Mike
England and tearing apart the
rest of the field. Moorhead ran a
4:05.? anchor leg in the distance
medley relay.

“I could talk about every guy
on the team and I would have
something good to say. It was an
opportunity that the team capi-
talized on,” Vasvary said.

After the excitement and
accomplishment at the Big East

‘ The Pitt News, Friday March 18, I983

Track Team Runs Away

was to W.V.U. and a tri-meet
with North Carolina, Kent State
and West Virginia.

“It was an emotional letdown
after the tough weekend we had
just spent at the Big East meet,"
Vasvary said. “Geary, Colas and
Gallagher didn‘t make the trip,
and though we had some good
performances, we ran the meet as
though our main concern was to
get it over with.

The Panthers were then ready
to enter the season finale-the
lC4A and NCAA champion-
ships. Vasvary and Lewis
decided that the team concerns
were secondary for the
remainder of the season—the
members should be given the
opportunity to achieve from an
individual status.

At the lC4A meet, March 5-6,
only Roger Kingdom was able to
advance to the ﬁnals. He did so
in two different events—the high
jump and the 60-yard high hur-
dles. Because of scheduling diffi-
culties, he could only compete in
the hurdles. He placed fourth,
good for four points, Pitt's only
points all weekend.

The NCAA meet was the sea-

son's final meet and the Panthers
had six team members qualified.
The two-mile relay team of
Geary, Brown, Moorhead and
Gallagher, Colas in the l,000-
yard run and Kingdom in the 60-
yard high hurdles all
participated.

Neither Kingdom nor Colas
advanced to the finals, but the
two-mile relay team did, placing
fifth, thus gaining All-America
status.

“They were outstanding,” Vas-
vary said. “Geary put us in first
with a big lead. Garland and
Terry ran great and Bill
responded about as well as
anyone could have expected. For
Todd and Roger, it was an excel-
lent learning experience. They
faced international competition
(in the l,000-yard run, 16 of the
2l entrants were foreigners). Just
qualifying for this meet is so
tough.”

The team has begun workouts
for the outdoor season that be-
gins April 2 at William and Mary
and The Colonial Relays. “We
have a team, and we have a lot of
fun. To me, that spells success. It
is hard to put a measurement on

m£et,_t_he Panthers’ next voyage
that success, but we want to pick
up right where we left off with the
indoor season,” Lewis said.

The outdoor season presents a
much different challenge for the
Panthers. There will be a much
greater need for overall team
strength since there are extra
events that are run outdoors. The
outdoors will also give the
Panthers the opportunity to
show the strength of their inter-
mediate hurdler corps. An
indoor season like the one the
Panthers are coming off can only
provide optimism for an outdoor
season that will definitely test the
hungry Panthers.

Paterno speaks out....

Penn State football coach Joe
Paterno told a Senate Panel yester-
day that action must be taken to stop
“unscrupulous” agents from luring
college athletes into professional __
sports before they graduate. L~.
 Both Paterno and Michigan foot- v
ball coach Bo Schembechlcr lashed
out at player agents. Their testimony
came at a hearing on legislation APT5.
designed to encourage professional
sports leagues from signing
0 undergraduates.
_ Paterno said, “We have a problem k‘~rA;__
in college with unscrupulous agents ofp;c5
contacting players before gradua-
tion. Our concern is with the l8—l9-
and 20- ear—oId kid who can be
seduced }into thinking he's a better A P TS .- {
commodity than he actually is and
giving up his college education.

McDonald placed fourth at the Big
East tournament, losing only to the
eventual champion. He had a losing
record last year, but Dieffenbach
expects only good things this season.
“Last year was a learning experience
for Jim. As a freshman, he was our
No. l player," said Dieffenbach.
“Everyone he played was tough, but
he’s developed some weapons are
consistency, now.” These, according
to Dieffenbach, could take him to
nationals.

The No. 2, 3 and 4 spots are still
up for grabs, withjunior Larry Led-
erer and seniors D.J. Mariano and
Jack Warwick fighting for them.

Lederer was last year’s No.2 man,
but sickness has hampered his play
the past week. If healthy enough,
he'll compete in today’s match at

on WORKE
on mun

 Madden

Penn State.

Mariano enters after a 9-4 singles
record last year, and according to
Dieffenbach, he is a strong player
who is “great when he is hot."

Warwick sat out last year, but has
remained active in the sport. He,
along with Lady Panther Kris Peck-
man, went 3-0 in this year’s Pitts-
burgh Intercollegiate Tennis
Classics. Dieffenbach thinks War-
wick will be important in adding the
top positions on the squad.

The No. 5 player is sophomore
Dave Kortyna, and junior Jay
Petras takes the No. 6 position.

Both are expected to play impor-
tant roles this season.

“If our No.5 and 6 players can rise
above the level of competition, and
our top four can do what is expected
of them, then we can do much better

than a 7-7 record,” Dieffenbach
said.

Also expected to break into the
lineup this year are senior Dan
Cook, sophomore Alan Grossman
and freshmen Jim Blackburn and
John Hahalyak.

ln doubles, McDonald and Mari-
ano take Pitt’s No. l spot. They are
currently ranked fifth in the Alle-
gheny Mountain Tennis Association
and 15th in the MSTA.

Lederer and Warwick take over
the No. 2 doubles spot. They started
the season strong by finishing fourth '
at the Big East Tournament.

Rounding out the Panther lineup,
Kortyna and Hahalyak will be team-
ing up once again, the two having
played together at Churchill High
School. '

Although Dieffenbach is confi-
dent his team will put forth a strong
showing, he recognizes the possibil-
ity of trouble in what he calls a
“Reader’s Digest condensed” ver-
sion of a season~one that includes
13 matches in 27 days.

“With only one month in a season,
it could be disastrous,” he said. “lt’s
a challenge for me as a coach. I have
to keep them motivated through; _
some tough matches. We are going '
to have to develop shots that we can
put our opponents away with, and
we also need to develop the ability to
keep the ball in play.”

The Panthers start the season off
tough, with a trip to Penn State
today, to Bucknell tomorrow and to
Lycoming Sunday.

Their first home match will be
against West Liberty State College
on March 28 at 3:30 p.m.

When I-lain Fniends opened its dooiis in BONEIRS AND BONNETTES—
Octoben, 1981, it was immediately
obvious that this was no nun-of-the-mill
hair: salon. It was desiqned and built fon
the comfont of clients by the staff itself.
The atmos heae is wanm and REl.AX£d with
wooden oons and antioues instead of
plastic, fonmica on chaome. The outdoon
patio pnovides a touch of added comfont in
the wanmen months.

At Hai_n_Fniends we believe we qneatest
competition is ounselves—oun conscience.
We want to qive you we best effont. Oun
knowledge, expenience and even expanding
nepeittoine of new shapes and pnopontions
ane one most impontant tools in finding a
look that suits you image and attitude.
We can take you wheite you want to qo.
