UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Midday Speaker Claims
Naked Beasts Arouse

Man’s Purient Instincts

by PRUDENCE POTT

“Naked animals are becoming a serious problem in the
United States. Man’s purient instincts are arro-used every
time he sees an unclothed beast,” commented G. Clifford
Prout at yesterday’s “Midday Lecture in the S.U. Ballroom.
Prout is the president of the Society for the Indecency of
Naked Animals (SINA), whose headquarters are at 507

Fifth Ave., New York City.
SINA is asking Congress to
make it illegal to appear on
the streets with an unclothed
animal. “We have compiled a
phamphlet that contains patterns
for making bermuda shorts for
dogs, cats, pigs, cows and al-
most every other kind of animal
imaginable,” Prout offered. “All
one need do is drop a postcard
to the head office in New York.
In addition, the Society is pro-
ducing doggy outhouses which
are being placed in strategic lo-
cations throughout the cities, so
that men and women will be
spared the immorality of seeing
dogs ‘doing their duty,’ as the
saying goes.” Saint Bernards are
being taught to clean out these
facilities Prout told the audi-
ence. All SINA is doing is re-
placing their beer kegs with
deodorant booties. He assured
the overﬂow crowd, that dogs
have already been taught to
take off their shorts in two sec-
onds, so no one need worry
about how the animals will com-
plete their bodily functions.
“But SINA does not stop with
this one crusade,” Prout remind-
ed. “We are greatly concerned
with the air pollution problem.”
He stated that the greatest dan-
ger to the population is the ever
increasing amount of Firbon di-
oxide being released into the
air, causing an inbalance be-
tween carbon dioxide and oxy-
gen, and that the impending
shortage of oxygen may be
traced to the problem of over-

‘weight. Abel claimed that those

people who weigh over 250
pounds are breathing in too
much oxygen and exhaling too
much carbon dioxide. “For this
reason we have begun to deport
all those who weigh over 250
pounds, Prout revealed.

Last month in Pittsburgh SINA
advertised in the local press of-
fering free malts, milkshakes,
sundaes, and eclairs for all those
who weighted over 250 pounds.
After being indoctrinated into
the SINA cause, half of the 275
people who attended the orgy
are outside of the continental
limits of the US and most of the
rest are now on crash diets,
Prout told the audience.

p SINA has also found a way to ’

ard of the Society for Conser-

correct the unemployment prob-
lem, Prout remarked. “All we
need do is require all the unem-
ployed to go naked and those
who are part-time employed to
go topless.” In this way, he con-
tinued, the unemployed will be
shamed into looking for jobs
and the employers will not have
to use employment agencies to
ﬁnd those who need jobs.

Concluding his remarks, Prout
urged anyone who wants to join
the Society to contact him at
his office. The organization has
over 50,000 members and is still
trying to increase its inﬂuence
by converting more people to its
‘cause.

“Boss” Ainisman Exposed

by JOHN LINGSTAFF

During a recent Pitt News
investigation of several cam.-
pus hangouts, it was discov-
ered that Howard “Boss”
Ainismann, ex-Student Gov-
ernment (SG) veep, is 51%
owner of the Cum Laude Cock-
tail Lounge, located down on
Forbes St. .

According ‘to Ainisman, he is
responsible for “the operation of
the bar when no Pitt student
leaders are around—not very of-
ten.” When asked whether there
was any relation between the
Cum Laude and SG functions,
Ainisman answered, “Are you
serious? On this campus——nev-
er!” Concerning ownership of
the Cum Laude, he said, “That’s
not Your Business!” This writer
replied, Is it Yours?”

Manager of the Cum Laude,
Miss Schenley S. Seagrams told
the Pitt News that Ainisman is
the owner. “He’s a student at
Pitt; he’s with the Student Gov-
ernment, 32O Schenley Hall. But

New Innovations

WESLEY POSVAR
Chancellor-defunct.

by NAJEEB HALABY

Now that the University’s ap-
petite for a new Chancellor has
been satiated, the question has
arisen in many circles as to
what innovations Chancellor-
elect Wesley Posvar plans to ini-
tiate. It seems that the Univer-
sity’s Chancellor-elect is at no
loss for words, and plans to
bring many ﬁrsts to the Univer-
sity—his ﬁrst civilian under-
taking. ‘ ,

When questioned as to What
he plans to do to ameliorate the
usual after-class traffic jams in
the Cathedral of Learning, Dr.
Posvar commented that he has
been toying with two possible
"solutions. First, Dr. Posvar sug-
gested calling in the Army Sig-
nal Corps to change all Cathe-
dral clocks into 24 hour chrono-
meters. “After all,” he stated,
“what was good enough for 700,-
000 in Korea, ought to be good
enough for 7,000 at Pitt.”

Dr. Posvar said that he has
also been considering renovating
the Cathedral's aging elevators.
He stated that by simply bring-
ing in the’ Army Corps of Engi-
neers, wings could be.fastened
to ‘eachftelevator car thud i’ L

creasing their upward speed. Dr.
Posvar continued mumbling,
“Got to move faster, got to
move faster”

The good Colonel termed the
University's severence with Mrs.
Frick as “no great loss.” He ad-
mitted that quite frankly he has
little interest in art, but that his
blueprints for the University of
the future do have recom-
mendations for the Frick Fine
Arts Building. Since the walls
will be a bit bare, he suggested
hanging portraits of “Amelia
Earhart, Charles Lindberg, and
Thomas Schelling” throughout
the ediﬁce.

‘That semblence of grass be-
tween the Cathedral and Heinz
Chapel will also be altered, Dr.
Posvar said. Since “grass takes
too much time to grow,” Colonel
Posvar is making arrangements
to have that plot converted into
a heliport for his private heli-
copter. He made it emphatic
that this new platform will not
be just for his use, but for “any
member of the faculty and stu-
dent body who also owns a heli-
copter or similar device.”

Rumors that hinted at Dr

Posvar’s planting a small “tacti-
cal" nuclear device under the
Cathedral's left side in order to
create a “leaning” impression,
were discarded when he dismiss-
ed the ideas as “not practical.”
Dr. Posvar did admit, however,
that he has been considering in-
stalling a huge fluorescent chron-
ometer atop the Cathedral. He
stated that the clock and the in-
clination could not both be af-
forded. He rationalized this in-
adequacy of funds by quipping,
“After all, it's no good to have
the inclination unless .you’ve got

 
  
   

the   ‘

-don’t send any samples there,
we don’t even allow the sales-
men to do that——it’s all ‘locked’
up.”

A check in the Prothonotary’s
Office of Allegheny County
showed that on October 19, 1964,
Howard Ainisman, 320 Schenley
Hall, received certiﬁcate number
008 for the ﬁcticious business
name of the Cum Laude.

The Cum Laude, according to
hearsay, was started for the pur-
pose of retail selling of booze. It
sells almost one dozen varieties
of Pitt Panther Juice, many
types of beers, a fulliline of
wines and cocktails.

“We handle a complete line
of Pitt Panther Juice,” volun-
teered Miss Seagrams. “We also
sell about 200 Pitt Martinis a day
at a cost of $1 each,” sheadded.
“We have a priority with the
Pitt student leaders, too——-the
‘Boss’ sees to that. When the
Hunt Room was overrun by the
commuters a few years ago and
dropped its liquor sales, my
boss (Howard Ainisman) moved
in. We bought out what the
Hunt Room had—they didn't
want to handle this type of stuff
anymore. We expanded their
product line.”

When asked what days busi-
ness is best, Miss Seagrams said,
“You men! Business builds up
fast after the SG meetings,‘the
SG Banquet and the SG Tap
Day. Howie always brings the
gang down with him.”

The Hunt Room, on the other
hand, has one fountain server
approximately two feet long
which dispenses root beer, Coke
and Pepsi. They also sell orange
drink, lemonade, grape drink,
three ﬂavors of milkshakes, cof-
fee and tea. Missing from the
Hunt Room are alcoholic bev-

erages, the lifeline of the Pitt

student leaders.
In response to the question of;

why these goods are not sold?‘
Miss Helluva Cesspool, mana-"‘
ger of the Hunt Room, said, “Up -

above ('SG) they don’t‘ feel those
goods are appropriate to be sold
here. It’s not my decision on
what’s sold here.” When asked
why these goods could not be
sold by catalogue, she answered-3'?
“You must be nuts!”

This reporter then walked to
the counter where beverages are

sold. A female employee with__
glasses and dirty hands asked”

to help me. I questioned her

about a double scotch on them
rocks. “If you don’t like what”
we sell here go to the Cum ’ 
Laude. They have a better line 6

than We do in all types of booze."
When Ainisman was question-

ed about which SG Committee Q

makes the suggestion as to what

products are sold in the Hunt 

Room he stated, “During Eric
Stern’s brief tenure as SG pres-
ident a "decision was rightly

.made to create an academic at-

mosphere in the Hunt Room. I i
think the SG Spirit Award Com-:
mittee made the suggestion in
about 1964 or 1965.” Speculat-
ing that the Hunt Room has al-
ways made money, Ainisman
said, “I don’t know how much
they make in that place‘, but it
sure must be a bundle, consider-
ing the prices‘/’ '

After gathering the above evi- 6

dence, this reporter notiﬁed Ain-
ismanof his ﬁndings. “You’re
next,” heisaid. “I’ve been think-
ing of changing the name to
Your Campus Cocktail Lounge,”
he added. To the question of
who owns the other 49 per cent '

of the business, Ainisman an- ‘

swered, “Dr. Robert . . . . . . . _

Frank Caught with Loot  
From Quad Panty Raid  

Fred Frank, bon vivant, pro-
fessional sycophant, and former.
perpetrator of the Pitt News,
was recently apprehended by
University Police in a parity
raid staged in Schenley Quad-
rangle by an obscure student
group known as Playboy's Pent-
house.

Fran-k, who_is presently incar-
cerated in the Dean of Student
Affair’s office incommunicado,
was dragged off forcibly by po-
lice and was heard to have yell-
ed, “And the student prince was
married to Queen Hatshepsut,
and moved to the Isle of Man,
where he lived in sensual pleas-
ure for the rest of his wretched
life.’-’ Students near -Frank rec-
ognized immediately the signiﬁ-
cance of this, the latest. of

_Frank’s insigniﬁcant parables. It ’

meant, of course, “Dirty cops,

Frank, according to anony- _

was among the ﬁrst at the Quad-
rangle. He‘ scurried from by- .
stander to bystander, querying,
“Where’s the silk? Where's the
silk? Gotta have silk.”

When the silk finally ﬂew,

Frank assembled a prefabricated
platform- tower, on which he
stood to obtain unfair advantage ‘
over his fellow degenerates. “The "
structure, solidly built, was a
veritable Tower of Babel,” said
an admiring bystander, Bartho-
lomew Bart-Boggs.  _
Several studentsattempted to” L’
scale Frank's tower, whereupon" 
they were bombarded with dev-N . ,

‘Original’ Is Institution
In Oakland Community

by DUNCAN HINES

Hard-working students get hungry, and Oakland is con-
sequently chock full of snack bars and beaneries. But it
seems that one establishment, the Jokeland Original, has
been in business even before the University was founded.
As a matter of fact, Mayor Barr has proclaimed this week
“Patronize the ‘O’ Week” in commemoration of its 233rd

year of service to Oakland.
Gus Miller, one of Oakland's
old-timers can still recall when
he and his grandfather went to
the Original “for an ‘O’ Dog”
with “mustard and kraut.” The
Original takes pride in its wide
variety of condiments ranging
from hickory-smoked chile to
saurkraut aged in driftwood
casks, and one employee, Pim-
ples Finster proudly claims that
the Original has served more
hot dogs than “all ’dem Nathan’s
joints put together.” Questions
of age withstanding, the Orig-
inal is certainly a landmark
cherished by all ‘Pittsburghers.
Perhaps the Original’s busiest
hour is Saturday night, when
University Romeos return from
dropping off their dates. One
University student remarks that
“the warm, efficient, and cour-
teous service is by far the ﬁnest
Oakland has to offer.” As a mat-
ter of fact, the Original’s man-
ager, Biaju Bonayudo, claims
that the employees of his es-
tablishment are the “highest

quality of culinary help avail-

able.” Bonayudo further claimed

that in order to be considered
for a position, an aspirant must
have a “prison record at least
an arm-long.”

The Original’s phenomenal
success, Bonayudo says, is due
to its exclusive process for hot
dog production. He claimed that
the “O Dog ‘machine” skillfully
yet automatically blends the in-
gredients fed it into .“a hot
dog beyond compare.” He later
admitted that this new electron-
ic marvel does have drawbacks.
“Once in a while, “Bonayudo
conceded, “the creature gets out

‘of hand and sucks everything in

sight into its “funnel.” He made
it clear, however, that no health
problems result because, “we
grab the dirty ones before we
throw them in a bun.”

Bonayudo said he was “quite
proud to work for such a repu-
table and long-standing estab-
lishment,” and he claimed that
the staff considers its chances
for acquiring a health permit
this year as “pretty near a nat-
ural.”

North Side At River

Site For New Dorms

James Hilton, the director of
University Housing, announced
today that the new dormitorys
that the University is planning
have been moved from the ceme-
tary to a location on the North
Side, across the river from the
bridge that leads to nowhere.

, “Its the most -obvious place in

the world,” Hilton said.

“I know there’s -been a little
crabbing about the fact that the
dorms are going to be used sole-
ly for the men, who might have
a little trouble in seeing their
—giI‘ls, but we’re planning for the
problem 'I‘here’s going to be a
great new ping-pong room‘, a
weight lifting room, and ﬁve
baseball diamonds. You can’t
tell me that any red-blooded

American boy would miss girls
with a set-up like that.

“The life of the boys up there
will be great. After getting up
in the morning to the aroma of
the river they will board ferries
to cross the river.

“I’ve heard some rumors that

_ the boys think that the trip to

the University to too long, but
I’m 150 years old, and I made
the trip in a hour ﬂat. In the
Spring the boys can swim the
river and save time if the ferry
isn’t running. The” pirrahnah
problem should be solved by
then.

The ferry service is planned
to take care of everyone. 'I‘here’s

already one running once a day.

Dialogue On Stu

_ DEAN: It has long been my point of view and my inherent philosophy
that students in a diverse educational situation, with myriad conflicts and
desires, have a definite role to play in an institution of higher learning.

 We believe that their opinions should be heard at every possible instance‘.

There is nothing I like more than hearing students discuss every aspect of

‘University life, except—any area of Student Affairs, the Twelfth Floor,

my outer office, my inner office, my conference room, John Vrana, the

‘ Litchfield era, the Bowman era, the Chancellor’s mansion, the Neville

House, Helen Clay Frick, or Earl Trent. In this areas administrative dogma
must prevail!_!- ~ -

While some have tried to model their role in student affairs after
that of a dedicated, labor-management mediator, I have always thought of
myself as more of a dowager empress, gaining wise and just counsel. From
my court of lackeys who know better than to challenge anything I say, as
a matter. of fact, I have always thought of myself . . . .

Students may wonder how they can become directly involved in th
life of their university. Although I have banned, by my imperial encyclical,
any 'riots,.demonstrations, free elections, vigils, posters, teach-ins, public

l’j statements without my personal censorship, and any other foolish expres-
' sion of opinion, students do have a right to help build our institution. (By

the Way, if you have any questions, boys and girls, my entire encyclical can
be found in the second edition of the Student Handbook, which can easily

  be obtained by prying off the paneling in the Jacobian Room of the Henry
I ._.,l-,,_ Clay Frick Fine Arts Buildings.)

Now, on some of my ideas on student involvement: First of all, what‘
could be a more signiﬁcant contribution than making peanut brittle on the

if _ twelfth ﬂoor with your mentor group? For the fen, I can think of no more

basically masculine endeavor than being a blanket boy on Lantern Night,

helping me arrange flowers in my office, or serving petit fours at my annual
memorial tea for those assistant deans of women lost in a 1944 panty raid.

I have always taken great pride at our student newspaper, The Pitt
News. About a year and a half ago, ‘just about the time when the student
directories were being passed out, I found it necessary to seize control of
the campus ..newspaper. ‘ Out my private funds, deposited in the Earl
Belle National Bank in Happy Hills, Guatemala, I was able to hire this
wonderful young man named Will Flabin, to serve as my editor-in-chief.
I knew I would always count on him, as I knew I could always count on my
favorite bf all Student Government presidents, Eric Stern. I was particu-
larly SURE (Students United for Responsible Expression) of this, since

I edited all of his copy and wrote a great deal of it myself. I was especially_

pleased about his editorial, “Viewpoints "On Women Today,” which com-

pared me so favorably to Mrs. Wayne Morse.

As one of my greatest heroes, Malcolm X, once said, “On this I stand;
I can do no other.

Does anyone disagree with anything I have said.

THE 50th anniversary of the
Bolshevik Revolution comes up
' in October and chances are the

; surprises in addition to the us-
 ual" parades. In all probability
 the Soviets will attempt to put
I a man on the Moon——an accom-
plishment that the United States
"won't be able to duplicate for
at least two more years. '
_ Not only will Washington's
‘*5 Dunand Bradstreet rating suf-
fer immeasurable harm, but also
it will givethe communist an-
other item to put into their port-
folios when their salesman come
calling on the peasants in under-
t_;; developed villages.

_Certain political groups _in
this country will at ﬁrst say
that the Soviets faked the land-
ing, but later they will change
their tune to: “What difference
does it make who gets to the
Moon ﬁrst?”

TIIE SOVIETS aren’_t as dumb
as some people would like us to
think. They planned this a long
timeago. When the ﬁrst UFO’s
started being reported in the
vUnited States, the authorities
“here dismissed the matter by
s_aying that all of the people

men spotted a UFO, they
changed their tune a little,
brought in a few scientists and
declared that it was marsh gas.
At the same time UFO’s were
cited along the Black Sea re-
sort areas, but the Soviets did-
n’t dismiss these citings lightly.

Worker has clear pictures of lit-
tle red men talking with ‘Nikita

point I would like to make an

. ist vs. Capitalist states based on

the afore mentioned empirical
evidence: On all planets where
life evolves, the Communist
state will be the ﬁrst to explore
space, but the Capitalist state
will have more color TV’s.)

It is also abvious that the So-

a.re planning wars of liberation
so that the moonmen will be

When communist historians

Disler Column

Cut Oh So Low‘

Editor, The Pitt News:

I wish I wasn't compelled to“

take time off from faculty po-
litics to answer Alan Disler’s
column in the Pitt News about
Earle Trent and Marti Luther
King’s. visit. The reason that I
am writing this letter is that
the charges in that column did
not come from Mr. Disler, but
directly from the Dean of Stu-
dents Office. -Proof? You'll see.

First of all, have you ever no-
ticed the large black box in the
back of the Dean of Student's
office? Well, that box is the box
that controls every shred of ma-
terial that goes into the Pitt
News. After ‘having consulted
several Electrical Engineers, I
discovered that the box is really
-a radio transmitter that is con-
nected to receivers emplanted in
the brains of every Pitt News
staffer before he is allowed to
write‘ a single word for the pa-
per. Every night at 12 midnight
a representative of the Univer-
sity whispers into a; microphone
that is attuned to the natural
body frequency of the Pitt News
reporters the text of their arti-
cles, which has already been ap-
proved by a committee made up
of representatives of John Birch
Society,“ the CIA, and the Ku
Klux Klan.

I know this whole set up
sounds unbelieveable to the av-
erage reader’ of the Pitt News,
but I have lain awake many a
night listening to the mysteri-
ous voices. After having heard

’ them for many weeks, I con-
sulted another engineer who"

told me the reason I alone was
able to hear them was that I

~have had the unbelievable for-
tune to be living in exactly the
place where the transmitters co-
axial cable takes a loop of 39
degrees, thereby shortcircuiting
the aeliron in the heavy side
layer due to the Lorentz trans-
formation. So far, I have been
the only person to detect these
waves.

The reason I am writing this
letter is to call attention to the
administration's attempt to take
over the political . views, of the
 ‘ .-here!

n I don't like it.

Timmons Named

ONE OF 1966's standing room only crowds rises
for the national anthem prior to the Penn State
game. Ticket manager Kenny George reported
attendance figures ‘rose to an all-time high des-

pite the football team’s terrible record. Pictured

here are the backbone of Pitt supporters—the

season ticket holders. UCLA opens the Panthers
1967 season Sept. 23.

Panther Demands Pressure Hart
While Spring Practice Continues

Dave Hart has more troubles.
One there was a time when he
didn’t have enough players, now
he has too many and he can’t
keep track of them.

For spring football practice,
89 prospects greeted Hart and
his staff. But as enthusiatistic ‘as
he appeared, Hart revealed an
inner turmoil.

“I don’t. know what’s come
over these kids, they're asking
for too much,” exploded Hart.
“When I recruited each player,
he seemed like a great kid.

“Nowadays, they expect too
much,” he continued. “Just the
other day, our All-American
quarterback Dick Rewisky bor-
rowed 20 bucks from my wife,

then he borrowed my station
wagons for his Saturday night
date.” - '

Hart has been the Pitt suc-

cess story in recent years. Once

appointed, it took him only a
few years to get exactly the
football program he desired.His
pressure tactics soon won out
over Athletic Director Frank
Carver’s academic integrity po-
licy.

Now Hart has his back to the
wall. For the "past two years, he
has had a total of 20 varsity
hold outs.

“They feel their classes im-
pose upon their grid careers,”
Hart noted. “Heck, since that
second season when I recruited.

---“Innu- -------- -: IIIIIIIIIIIIII

In the immortal words of Aeschylus, “That which is best

- is done at~night.” I’d like to explain how I’ve lived up to

those words during the past year. .

~ When the football team flew to_Los Angeles, naturally
I dragged along. _I had never seen Disneyland. I had never
even seen a stewardess before. So I put the two together
on the Friday night before the UCLA game. And I still

don’t understand whyshe left ‘me and ran
off with Mickey Mouse.
Anyway, two weeks later, the football
— _ team tried their luck against California.
' Berkeley is just outside San Francisco, and
that’s where my next escapade took place.
ON TOP of one of the hills,'I came across
a fancy nightclub. Gosh, was it fancy! The
girls didn’t wear anything to cover their
. . , well you know what I mean. I asked
four of them for a quick date but they all
were busy. So I went out with a couple of

players for a ride on a trolley instead.

On the plane ride back, one of the coaches asked me if
I would serve as escort for the same players on the next
trip. I said “Yes, gladly.” Maybe that’s why the coach left

the team.

DON’T GET me wrong, though. Birddog and the rest
of them had a good" time in Miami. I deserted the bunch to
lay on the beach and catch the ‘rays. My only problem was
some girl who claimed she was the Orange Bowl Queen. She

made me miss the game.

After Miami, came Notre Dame and Syracuse. Good

nights. both of them.

Just last week, Satch Moili-

Hart a petition with a petition
with the players’ demands. “We
feel the varsity members are en-
titled to as much loot as the

Moilibee unionized the pre-

Florida, New York’ City, and
California; (2) No m_ore games

Seven Footer Alcindor

Will Attend University

In two startling announcements, the Athletic Depart-
ment revealed that Basketball Coach Bob Timmons has been
named Coach of the Year and that Herman Alcindor will

attend the University next year.

Timmons, who found out “while
I was hard at work in my of-
ﬁce,” admitted that he was stun-
ned when named Coach of the
Year by the East Turtle Creek
Little League. “My secretary
jumped right off my lap at the
news,” Timmons exclaimed, “and
all I could say was ‘Gosh.”’

Herman Alcindor is a 3’8”
midget who recently set a rec-
ord with a leap of 7’ in. the
standing broad jump (the broad
was stoned at the time), at the
games of the Little People in
Corning, Iowa.

The man most startled by the
news was, once again, the ﬁery
Timmons.

mons. “We‘have enough mid-
gets on the basketball team now
without adding another one.”

Timmons face turned an an-
gry red as he snorted, “I guess

we’ll use him at center. He can
probably outjump our boys.”
Frosh Coach Tim Grgurich,
who is responsible for_recruit-
ing the wrong Alcindor, was in-
terviewed while packing his bag
in hopes of a quick getaway.
“I thought it was a smart
"move,” replied the always soft-
spoken Grgurich. “Now that
they’ve outlawed the dunk shot,
there’s no use for the big man
anymore. Besides, most of them

"We had a chance to get three
or four guys over 6’8”, but I
intend to look for more guys
like Herman. We can employ a
whole new strategy, dribbling
under big guys and so on. Be-
sides, anything would be better
than the team we have now.”

Matmen Nip Lehigh, I
Gain EIWA Crown

The varsity matmen’s long awaited return to the top
spot in the East has finally been realized. And it happened
only a year after the sa.me squad finished fifteenth out of

sixteen teams in the same tournament.

The matmen, a six-man maintenance crew headed by William
Brophy, cleared the Palestra floor of all wrestling mats in 4:O2:2
Saturday to edge second place Lehigh by less than a half second.

“Yes, it is a remarkable comeback,” said Brophy, “but I had
a funny feeling we'd win it all after we each had two bowls of
Wheaties for breakfast.

“Actually, I think we could have broken four minutes if we
had had all the training these other teams get. Our problem at Pitt
is that after the wrestling meets there are so many of the varsity
wrestlers left lying around that it's impossible to practice an effi-
cient routine.” .

However, Brophy, chose not get aggravated at the discomfort
the wrestlers caused him throughout the season and in the East-
erns. Instead, he looked ahead to the NCAA next Weekend at the

they were in slow heat. As for the others, I’d imagine Michigan and

The main reason for that spirit is the matmen’s self-appointed
cheerleader, Horse Czarnecki, whenever spirits run low, Horse
charges down the hill to Gustine’s to replentish the supply.

“Of course, this is the kind of sport you have to condition for
——with all that lifting and pulling,” said Horse, “but a little nip
once in a while boosts anyone’s moral.”

Among the other plaudits handed out to the matmen were
those contributed ‘by wrestling coach Dave Johnson.

“Bill and his boys have done a ﬁne job and are to! be con-
gratulated on the credit they’ve brought to the University. They
were always patient with our wrestlers even though We cut into
their practice time,” said dentist-coach Johnson.

,Disco<vered to be Catholic

by MRS. CAWN

Rabbi Ruben L. Richardstein
was removed today as chaplain
to Jewish students at the Uni-
versitywhen it was discovered
that he was- really a Roman
Catholic.

Students in, his French 181
course were suspicious of him
because he was always saying,

a “If I weren’t Jewish, I would be

a Roman Catholic.” They found
out he really was a Roman Cath-

‘ olic after two CIA agents were

informed of this possibility by
the Pitt NSA chapter.

They followed him after last
Tuesday's lecture when he was

' , supposed to discuss the Death

of God at the Jewish Theological
Seminary in New York. It turn-
ed out that he boarded an El
Al ﬂight to Tel Aviv, but got
off at the Rome stopover. From

7 there he took a VW to the Vati-

can.
A check up of airline tickets

showed that on his supposed

trips to Toronto, Emory, Chi-
cago,"and Boston he had also
visited the Pope in the Vatican.
It was suggested that he came
to receive absolution for pre-

tending to be Jewish.

When CIA officials traced his
family tree they found out he
was related to John Paul Start-
er, noted existentialist, and this
is probably were he picked up
his radical background. It was
also found out that he was a
brother-in-law of Marshall Mac-
Luhen and this isprobably the
only reason he uses Mac’s book
on Media in his course which is
listed as French Novels.

It is also believed that Rich-
ardstein owns a part interest in
Tim O’Reilley’s LRD plant in
San Francisco which he plans to
visit soon. (LRD is an achronym
for: LetRiversrunDownirishhi1ls
tolowvaleysandt'helnoncemorbac-
kuptohumptoncherwickevery-
bodyandadamandevetothe.)

The CIA men also found out
that Richardstein has been see-
ing a psychiatrist regularly for
the past seven years and the
high costs have forced him to
do free-lance psychonalysis for
his students on a part time
bases. The proof of this was
found in a newspaper adver-
tisement which describes the
service and gives his office hours

THE SPRING ‘run Riot

as Tuesday and Thursdaysfrom
2:35 to 3:40 p.m.

A check in the Student Record
Office showed that 90 per cent
of his students during the past
three years had received A’s and
seven per cent had received B's,
and during this time his bank
account had grown to the point
where he could afford a 15 room
mansion, while he was only
making $85 weekly as a Rabbi.

It was also found that the 26
books for his course cost a total
of $54 and that he had received
a check for $270 from the Na-

tional Paperbooks Association. _

It was also noticed in an old
graduation picture that he real-
ly had blond hair, but he died
it black to look more Jewish.

A local priest commented when
hearing the evidence, “I still
can’t believe a Catholic could
have written that article in Play-
boy on Student Morality.”

I Out—of-State Students e  

Out-----Michaelangelo

Joseph Michelangelo, the Uni-
versity’s public relations head,
disclosed today that the Univer-
sity will accept no more out-of-
state students as of next Sep-
tember.

Michelangelo attributed this
change in policy to two basic
reasons. First, in cooperation
with the Pittsburgh Police De-
partment, the Admissions De-
partment will do all it can to
inhibit traffic across the Pan-
ther Hollow Bridge. Both parties
agree that the current condition
of the bridge is such that out-
of-state migration may cause
disaster.

The second reason, Michelan-

gelo claims, is Helen Phoole and
Gwilym Priceless’ decision to re-
trench to a “Fortress Universi-
ty” policy that will make Pitt
“one of Allegheny County’s ﬁn-
est regional institutions.”

Trusty Gwil stated that this
system of regional emphasis was
most successful in his corpor-
ate dealings.

Helen Phoole did say, how-
ever, that some out-of-state stu-
dents would be accepted provid-
ing they signed a letter of intent
to live in the University's pro-
posed Panther Hollow Dormi-
tories which will be managed
jointly by Saga Food and Langs-
dorff Enterprises.
