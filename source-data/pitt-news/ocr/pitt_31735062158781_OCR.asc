Wherein The Events Of
A Saturday Afternoon
Are Reviwed . . .

BY LEONARD LEVISON
Sports Editor

All we have to say is that

Marshall Goldberg ran down '

the ﬁeld in the ﬁrst’ quarter and
we’ll see you at Fordham next
week. That, in skeleton sub-
stance, is the story of the 1937
Pit-—Duquesne game.

But, we’ve got more of a story
‘to tell. It’s the story of a Pitt
football team that played real
football for the ﬁrst time this sea-
son. Of a Pitt team that has
proven time and time again that
when it wants to win, there’s no
team that can beat it.

'Yes,.there were mistakes Satur-
day. There were times when the
Panthers missed up on excellent
scoring chances. And there were
times, few that they were, that the
blockers didn't connect and some
of} the tacklers didn’t bring down
their man. But, there was little
time in. Saturday’s game that Pitt
stood in any chance of losing.

ONLY VICTORY

Bomber Shaw’s great tackle in
the fading minutes of the contest
when he broke through and nab-
bed Boyd Brumbaugh for an 11-
yard loss as the Duke was wait-
ing to throw a touchdown pass
was not merely a break that
cinched the contest. It was the
inevitable maneuver of a team
that was playing to win.

“If we could play this game
over,” was the thought in every
Panther mind one black afternoon
last October. ‘Well, there must
have been a tang of destiny in the
meeting this year of the Panthers
and the Dukes.

The rain was back, both teams
were back, a bigger crowd, num-
bering close to 60,000 was there.
The setting was identical. And the
Panthers played as if they were
playing that game over.

BIGGIE DOES IT

Taking the ball on the 20-yard
line after Brumbaugh’s punt over
the goal line, Pitt ﬁrst let Stebbins
go after the yardage. Curly grab-

Harry Gilbert, graduate chair-
man of the Intersectarian Forum,
which represents the various cul-
tural, religious and racial groups
in Pittsburgh, has announced that
the group will visit East Liberty
Presbyterian church, Penn and Hi-

ASSISTED AT WUP

“Uncle Bill” was at the Univer-
sity, then WUP, when it celebrated
its hundredth anniversary. WUP
had not yet moved from down-
town to the heights above Perrys-
ville avenue. On that property
was the original Allegheny Ob-
servatory; its director, Dr. Lang-
ley, and his young assistant, Bill
Ludewig, built their “whirling ta-
ble.” It was the forerunner of the
modern wind-tunnel in which the
reactions of aeroplanes to aid
movements are studied.

Instead of aeroplanes, Langley
and Bill Ludewig used stuffed
birds. From them they learned
first principles of aeroplane wing
construction. Then they made

Dr. Ferguson
Finishes Text
On Economics

Dr. John M. Ferguson, associ-
ate professor of economics, has
recently ﬁnished writing a book
entitled, “Landmarks of Economic
Thought.”

The book is one of a series ti-
tled “American Business Funda-
mentals.” This series, according
to Dr. Ferguson, aims to give both
students and adults the distilled
essence of each subject, and to
present as much detail as may be
necessary to illustrate them and
suggest a method of approach to
the daily problems of commerce,
industry, and ﬁnance.

Dr. Ferguson’s volume is to be
published in English within two
weeks, and in Spanish within the
next six months. At a later date
it will be translated and published
in Russian, Polish, and several
other languages. This volume
embodied 14 years of thought and
14 months of writing.

The editor-in-chief of the series

is Justin H. lMoore, dean of the
School of Business and Civic Ad-
ministration College of the City of
New York.

Chinese Student Reports

On Conditions

Among the 150 students sent by
the Chinese government to Ameri-
can universities, is Kwan Han Sun,
graduate of the National univer-
sity of Chekiang, Hang-Chow.

Sun is enrolled in the Graduate
School.

A native of Hang-Chow, indus-
trial center of China, so-called
“Pittsburgh of the Orient,” Sun is
working for his masters’ degree in
chemistry. He speaks both Eng-
lish and German, in addition to his
mother tongue.

Arriving in Pittsburgh last
week, the Chinese student came
directly from what he terms “the
horrors of wanton destruction in
Shanghai, Nanking, and other
Chinese cities.”

Sun revealed that the party of
governmental students were forced
to remain in war-torn Shanghai
for a month prior to their depart-
ture.

Here, in the city where the
Japanese have bombed the univer-
sity, schools, and printing plants,
the America-bound students were

In Orient

eye-witnesses to the actual de-
struction of a Japanese ﬂagship by
Chinese airmen.

A daily sight, added Sun, was

the horde of people’ milling about

steamship agencies seeking refuge
on ships bound for foreign ports.

Food, normally low in prices,
had skyrocketted4, whereas Chi-
nese silks, jades, and ivories could
be had for a song.

After waiting a month in Shang-
hai for transportation to the
United States, Sun, with his fellow
students, departed to Hong Kong
and there boarded the S. S. Presi-
dent Grant. Landing in Seattle,
the students separated, each head-
ing for his assigned university.

Kwan, who is also the recipient
of a fellowship from the Univer-
sity of Ting-Hua, Peiping, intends
to make a study of Pittsburgh
mills and factories.

He will devote next year to
study at Alfred University, New
York. Upon his return home, as
a ceramic chemist, he will special-
ize in the development of optical
glass.

Players Join
Fund Drive

Pitt Players will join the groups
participating in the 1937 Com-
munity Fund Campaign, accord-
ing to an announcement today by
Carl Cass, assistant professor of
English and I director of the
Players.

Thornton Wilder’s one-act play,
“The Happy Journey to Trenton
and Camden” will be presented by
the Players during the second
Community Fund Exposition to be

position.

Whitehill has conducted tryouts
for the roles in the Wilder play,
but says that several parts have
not been ﬁlled as yet. He expects
to mke his ﬁnal selections for

Songs Tonight

Although he is no moun-
taineer, John Jacob Niles will
present a program of American
folk songs as the music depart-
ment of the University inaug-
urates its concert series tonight
at 8:30 o’clock in the Stephen
Foster auditorium. Niles’ pro-
gram will consist of the authentic
ballads which are replacing the
“hillbilly” songs often attributed
to the mountaineers.

Niles has quite an unusual sys-
tem for obtaining these folk songs
from the natives. He will go into
their homes or meeting—places and
sing a few songs of his own, and
in return the Kentuckians will.
sing their folk songs. These songs
Niles learns and adds to his list
of true American music.

Niles, besides being a singer, is ;
also a composer and a wri.ter of‘
note. Some of his better known
works are, “Singing Soldiers,”
“Songs My Mother Never Taught
Me,” and “One Man’s VVar.” A,
member of the staff of the Univer- l
sity of Kentucky, he is at present
compiling a dictionary of Eliza-
bethan, Tudor, Middle English,
and Saxon words which are still

American Lithographs

Shown In A

By AUSTIN HAY

The etchings, woodcuts, and
lithographs of the American Art-
ists Group now on view in the new
seventh ﬂoor ﬁne arts library of
the Cathedral offer the public a
chance to see a. range ofisubject
matter that will appeal to all pos-
sible tastes.

There are examples of conserv-
ative and so-called modern art, of
realistic, abstract, and even sur-
realist art. There are landscapes,
humorous, and genre pictures; pic-
tures for those who like sailing
and other sports; pictures of ani-
mals, nudes, industrial scenes and
still life; pictures for those who
want purely decorative 4prints for
their walls.

In variety of subject matter and
treatment, this exhibition comes
very close to being a complete
cross—section of the whole range
of contemporary American Art

In assembling the American
Artists Group, a deliberate at-
tempt was made to bringitogether
representative artists of every

rts Library

school and style of art. No matter

w.=h-a-t'one’s taste or inclination may
be,_ an opportunity to  it
should be found among the widely
diverse offerings of Rockwell Kent,
Emil Ganso, Mig4uel_Covarrubias,
and forty—six otl"r'er'famous-‘ artists
represented in the exhibit.
PICTURES RE-EDITED

These original prints have been
exhibited before; they are works
that have been created as a part of
the American Artists Group’: pro-
gram of making the best contem-
porary art of America available
not only to the wealthy art col-
lector but to those average Amer-
icans who enjoy good music, good
books, and other ﬁner things of
life.

These artists whose pictures
command the highest ' prices in
limited editions, whose works are
part of the permanent collections
of our leading museums, by over-
riding the barrier of scarciety,
make it possible to ocer original
etchings and lithographs at a price
of two dollars and 75 cents.

Toward Lower Degrees . . .

‘C HERE aren’t enough clients to go

around,” says John R. Tunis, writing
about the Ainerican College mart in the cur-
rent issue of Scribner’s magazine.

According‘ to Mr. Tunis, who seems to have
contributed a fair although popularized inves-
1'.ig'ati\-'e report on the situation, the latest gov-
_ci.=nnicnt. statistics give the number of degree-

 gi'21iiting' universities in this country at about
one tliousand. The number of students en-
rolled is slightly over one miIlion——‘.vhich aver-
zxct-s a thousand students per institution.

’ This average ﬁgure  excessively high be-
cause the huge enrollments of large municipal
izfml state universities, and l\lr. Tunis estimates
that seven or eigrlit hundred sn1aII.e1' colleges
are “student-poor. ”

Competition for students among these is so
keen iihat‘ many have gone in for high-pressure
salesniansliip methods which aim mainly at in-
c1'easin,«.»; the quantity and not the quality of ‘Lille
:<tu<Ici1ts who enroll.

If the practice is continued the value of a

' more valueless.

Best publicity Plit has developed in the last year
is the combined movie-lecture tours of James Potts,
assistant track coach, given before high school
audiences everywhere. The movies were ﬁlmed by
Potts at last year’s spectacular Olympic Games.

Says distinguished Dr. George W. Gerwig, head
of the commission, “Every child in our public school
system should see these pictures.” Potts has been
taking movies for the University for the past three
years. Every football Saturday he exposes 1000
feet of 16mm Super—Sensitive to record the games.

They are projected the following week before D13;

Sutherland and the team to correct playing errors.

S r
-..and 

By Nick Spanos

You may have heard of Bette Davis’ story squab-
bles with Warner Bros. It seems she’s sick and
tired of being a suffering woman struggling to
make a decent livingthou-gh burdened with ":1 rec-
ord. It is ‘rumored thatwith the addition ‘of the
Stanley’s “Tliat Certain Woman” I can see Vvl1'-are
Bette would need at least nine lives to live dbwn
all the pasts that Hollywood digs up for her.

Of -course the pasts are all so similar that Bette
might be- ableto chisel some sort of arrangement
to live them all down at once and save time. Yes,
the resemblance of one o-f Bette-’s pasts to the
others is certainly remarkable. I hadn’t yawned

at more than ﬁve hundred feet of the Stanley’s fea-
ture before I was mutteringto myself, “Hmm, its
the same damn story.”

This time it seems that Bettepulls a boner when
she’s fifteen years and some odd months old by
marrying Al Haines, prominent thug. Al goes for
a ride and Bette makes the headlines. That was
about eight years ago and now Bette, a really nice
girl although a little lacking in opportunism, is
working in a famous lawyer’s office under an as-
sumed name.

Not only that but she’s in love. Yea its the real
thing thistime and guess who the johnny is. No
not Robert Taylor (there is no Robert Taylor pic-
ture this month, Q. E. D.). No, its Henry Fonda
and is Henry a sight! Whewl He’s positively sicken-
ing. He made me think he was Freddie Barth-
olomew grown much older and sweeter and become
.9. Deli. What I want to say is Henry was very very
sad in all respects.

Well Henry like any college man has a stern and
rich father who forbids him to marry women like
Warmers make Bette out to be. And when he does
pull off a stunt like that the old man turns on the
pressure by shutting off the allowance and an an-
nulment ensues. So it was with Bette and Henry.
They hadn’t enjoyed the privacy of their honey-
‘moon hotel room more than three hours when the
old man blows in and gums up the works.

Result is that Henry leaves Bette, and Bette has
baby all of which made Spanos very sad as baby is
cute and Bette is such a ﬁne girl. In fact Spanos

been near first base.

very well and you ‘probably know it. He does-have

Fairy Tales Retold

namely, the March Of Time and The Prisoner of
_Zenda. Because the Prisoner was the main fea-
iture the rest of the review concerns it only.
Maybe I should be more partial to the Prisoner‘
than I am if only because Ronald Coleman and
Madeline Carroll are cast in it. But I don’t knowi

. . . I must havehad an off day. Even the fact
that Ronald as an English captain and Madeline as
ia princess are given plenty of opportunities to
gsquarei their shoulders, ﬁll their eyes with longing ,
fand sigh dolefully about duty to king and country,
’didn’t help". And the large amount of woo pitched
along traditional English lines was, I think, a detri-
ment.

The background of this new old boy-meets-girl
Iﬁction is a small kingdom somewhere in Eastern
fliurope. Ronald is vacationing there on the eve,
{of the coronation of the new king, Rudolph the?
iFii'th (also played‘ by Ronald).

I Unfortunately for the coronation, the king to be
Ihas an unreasonable attachment to whiskey sours
ior something, an‘d‘.as‘ a result, the night before the
icrowning, ‘he arrives at a condition familiarly
‘known as “plastered.” The frantic courtiers are
«fearful that if he appears at the coronation in such
 state public resentment might be so great that
§l*_-is half brother‘ Grand Duke Michael might pull
la double and seize the throne (the cadl). So Ron-
la-ld who looks exactly like the king is drafted as
 a pinch hitter for one day.

Complications arise when real king is kidnapped
 and Ronald falls in love with Madeline, the king’s,
betrothed. Things happen fast after this and

triumph of duty over love. I mean that boy does
snot completely make girl.

' In spite of any unfavorable insinuations that may
have been gathered from the above The Prisoner
; manages to be an entertaining picture. It would
ihavc been far better if some of the heavy emotion
' had been toned down. -

Editor The Pitt News:
Herein speaks ‘a -"voice o,_f?anony-

Think 

mitt  the, isubdect _of inane-
“quibblmg” within the represen-

tative Campus organizations on in-
terests that are secondary in rela-
tive value to student welfare.
These groups consisting of cam-
pus-“bi'g<g_ies’-’ as elected by social
status and faculty inter-relation-
ship do not represent the great
majority of mere registrants, and
cannot therefore be immediately
concerned with the interests of
the average student.

As proof’ of this contention-
whathas happened to the proposal
of reduced bus and trolley fares
as set forth upon the platform of
electional nominees to these or-
ganizations? Doubtless, it served

as a mere step in the attainment-

of the individual’s personal ob-
jective. What is the basic cause
for disinterest in the cooperative
group that promised student eco-
nomies?

Summarily, it seems that a dis-

proportionality existed between ,
'cept by the consciences of its edi-

the amount of work necessary for
success and the personal beneﬁts
to be derived from the achieve-
ment. We, the mere student
body, who absorb culture much as
a sponge collects water (squeezing
sponge is analagous to struggle for
existence after graduation) wish
to keep at a minimum the expen-
ditures for this temporary ﬂight
into the esthetic and therefore ask
that SFA, Men’s Council, etc.,. take
immediate action on the reduction
of cost’s for student essentials.
Why not a cooperative book-
store? Vfhy is initiative lacking
injthe for-"um action of plans for
reduced bus and trolley fares? Is
discrhnation in the allotment of
part-time employment practised?"
It appears so. i_' If a local restau-
ranteur were to receive by agree-

Entrepeneur Rather Than Editor
Determines Newspaper Policy

:5

_ W'e’d like to think well’ of newspapers in general but the»
weight of evidence against‘ the Fourth Estate weighs down our
good intentions and 04V_eI‘wh8lll1S usvjwith .(I0I]E:)fg_ ’

K h Not that newspapers are out and out villains-sometimes
 «_‘il(I‘€—,0,I’__tha’E Vt-hell“ operators are wicked or simply mis-
guided, for  don think that such is the ca__s'c..

. I They are possibly no more wicked than business: enterprise
in general. However, it IS the -discrepancy between the ideals

pers that is the vital factor. By
the nature of it the newspaper is
supposed to be of, a higher order
of things than ordinary business
enterprise. ‘

Since its purpose is the purvey-
ing of news and opinion it is in
the nature of a public utility, for
upon the quality of its services de-
pend the healthy views of a great
majority of the citizens. There-
fore society has an interest in its
proper functioning.

REGULATION BY CONSCIENCE

But because there is no con-
venient or possible yardstick by
which to measure those services,
the newspaper is not subject to
regulation as are other public util-
ities. That is, no regulation ex-

tors. It is argued that there
are clammering for a “football
which is
science of its editor. ,
But the simple fact is that to-
day, editors, with few exceptions,
do not determine policy. That is
the function of the ﬁnancial entre-
preneur, who may know nothing
or care not at all for the public
service relationship, as witness the
newspapers and press services
which contested the W'agner La-
bor Act and the American News-
paper Guild as opposed‘ to the
principle of a free press.

NEWSPAPER‘ CHANGES
In the old days, and it still holds
in some case today, the editor was

the entrepreneur. He usually
but he realized-

paper directly,

He was interested in.

. his paper the best paper that -he.‘
i could‘. It was not always good or-
‘wise or enlightened; but it was.

sincere.

Few‘ people would advocate that
the same I'io=lcls- true today. Be-

of ordinarybusiness and newspa-%

imposed by the con--

made his living from the news-'

that it was only’ by his newspaper ;
being a progressive and enlight- r 
. ened force 1" n his comrhunity would
; it prosper.
: his commtmity because he lived inn 1
 it and therefore sincerely made;

they are important as mone+ymak-
ers other than in selling advertis-
ing space, newspapers are not sub-
ject to the simple impulse‘ for
truth that dominated them once-
upon a time. They are not news-
papers so much as ﬁnancial en-
terprises; and so long as they are
that, it is illogical to exempt them
from public regulation because of
the tenuous argument of “freedom
of the press.”

And if they pursue in the future
the tactics they followed in the
Black case, and others in recent
years, they will undoubtedly ﬁnd
that the public, or that part of it
which they have attacked so vi-
ciously, will insist upon regula-
tion.

Marshall Goldberg, started fast
through right tackle, reversed his
field once, went out into the sec-
ondary zone, reversed again, and
after 77 yards had been covered,
Pitt had won the game.

Goldberg, in scoring, outran the
.last two Duquesne backﬁeld men.
He was given life-saving assist-
.ance by an entire team’s perfect
blocking. Frank Souchak made,
what to every end is tantamount
to scoring itself, the final block,
-eliminating the last man.

kept Pitt back to its end zone. A
very well executed run by Steb-
bins of 20 yards brought the ball
to the 36 yard line, Goldberg
brought it to midﬁeld as the time
was called.
DRY JERSIES

A partially blocked punt ended

the Pitt advance. With the second

team playing the second quarter-

there was no scoring approach.
‘When the Panthers came out onto
‘the field in the second half, they
had new jersies on. ‘This didn’t
confuse the Dukes as much as it
did the sports writers and fans.

This move, by pre-game permis-
sion of the officials, was to give
th-e,Panthers a change from the
cold, wet uniforms. It also seem-
ed to add punch to the Pitt at-
tack. Duquesne, kicking off, bob-
bled the ball, and Pitt took it far
upﬁeld.

Stebbins, Goldberg‘, mostly Big-
gie, and Stapulis carried the Pan-
thers down to the Duke 7-yard
line. Here, injuries forced Dalle-
Tezze and Goldberg out of the
play. Urban, replacing the Pitt
left-halfback, was unable to gain,
and the Dukes snatched the big
apple.

Pitt’s other point-making op-
portunity came when Gene Onder
foozled a punt and the ball went
to the Panthers on the 14-yard
line. A miss-pass from center en-
able the Dukes to pounce on the
ball.

Another center error, caused by
Dannies’ high tension, presented
the Bluffmen with their chance
late in the game. Two Brumbaugh
passes put Duquesne on the 10-
yard mark. This was too much
for Bomber Shaw, and he ended
the game with his brilliant tackle.

Singing out individual stars in
what was a whole, coordinated

team effort is not altogehtre nec-.

essary. But, there were stand-
outs. Frank Souchak contributed
the finest game of his collegiate
career. Oﬁensively, he more than
took care of his man, tackle Joe
Maras. His tackling was ex-
ceptional.

Unfortunately, he was involved

-in the one regrettable incident of

the game. In self-defense, Souchak
claims that the motion that he
made was not a deliberate punch,
but a stab at the ball which Mat-
sik had juggled.

At the other end. Paul Shaw was
almost as brilliant. Tony Matisi,

Bumper Crop Of Boners
Turn Up In Freshman Tests

University History, Facts Receive New
Interpretations In Annual Customs Exam

By DAN CANNON

Mild insanity is predicted for
the upperclass counselors who will
attempt to decipher, d-ecode, or
translate the papers handed in by
freshman men in. the customs
test held last week.

Not only was every street cor-
ner in Pittsburgh credited with be-
ing the birthplace of Pittsburgh
Academy, but one brave soul went
far enough to suggest the Point
Bridge as a likely spot. Esti-
mates on the height of the Cathe-
dral ranged from 31 to 52 stories.

New and dubiously improved
versions of the time-honored Uni-
versity songs were presented by
various ambitious students, and
there was great confusion as to
who is what on the campus. The
presidency of the Men’s Council
was ascribed to several persons,
including Robert R. Corley, assist-
ant to the dean of men, and Rob-
ert Dannies. Dr. Williams was

er, and one paper gave the state-
ment that “Dr. Bowman was the
instigator of a building program.”

Theodore Whitaker was over-
burdened with the duties of being
editor of The News, chairman of
SFA, and president of Men’s Coun-
cil. The humble beginning of
Pittsburgh Academy was noted by
one befuddled freshman, who
wrote, “Pitt had only one student
to begin with—Judge Henry
Breckenridge.”

Gross injustice must have been
done to the student who thought
that the last line of the Alma
Mater was, “God forgive thee,
evermore,” and overpowering the
wrath of the person who wrote,
“Pitt has been called many names
by her students.”

But the one which takes the
ﬁgurative cake is the plaintive
plea of the freshman who wrote

on the last page of his booklet,
“Please explain to me how I can

referred to as an upperclass lead- get a plague.”

WORKER WITH LANGLEY

In 1891,_ Langley learned enough
of aerodynamics to publish his
hsitoric book containing formulas
and diagrams which aeronautical
engineers today say are accurate.
In that year, too, Dr. Langley was
appointed to the highest scientiﬁc
post in the United States, secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institute.
William Ludewig, by then inter-
ested in astronomy, chose to re-
main in Pittsburgh and work in
the laboratory of John Brashear,
the famous maker of telescope
lenses.

“Uncle Bill” Ludewig was ac-
tive in the building of the new
Allegheny observatory in River-
view park, dedicated in 1912. In
the succeeding decades, he stood
nightly under the big telescope
there, and told visitors the stories
of astronomy—how many years it
takes the light of the stars to

reach the earth; how many moons

spin around the planet Saturn;
what causes eclipses.
APPOINTED TO STAFF

In 1920 he was appointed to the
University’s teaching faculty, and
in 1932, “Uncle Bill,” who had
never attended college, was
awarded an honorary Master of
Science degree.

Last spring Mr. Ludewig was
given by Chancellor John G. Bow-
man the assignment of construct-
ing, for exhibition in the Cathe-
dral during the University_’s cele-
bration of the one hundred ﬁftieth
anniversary of its founding, a
model of old Allegheny Observa-
tory as it looked when he was at
youth, complete with a scale
model of the “whirling table” in
the front yard.

Mr. Ludewig, who has never
married, is survived by his sister,
Mrs. C. E. DeVore, with whom he«
lived, and his brother, Joseph, of
Washington, D. C., who is a mem-
ber of the staff of Smithsonian In-
stitute and the United States Bu-
reau of Standards.

Student Recitals,

Recordings

This season’s series of SFA-
sponsored concert hour programs
will open next Wednesday in 2317
Cathedral at 3:30 o’clock, with a
recital consisting partly of record-
ed music and partly of chamber
works to be presented by stu-
dents.

Main offering of the program
will be Schubert"s “Unﬁnished
Symphony,” recorded by the Phil-
adslphia symphony Under Leopold
Stokowski. Other A piécdes of ‘re-
corded music will include excerpts
from 'I‘schaikowsky’s “Nutcrack-

er Suite,” and Albert Schweitzer’s
interpretation of a Bach fugue.

Numbers to be given by the
University piano trio, consisting of
Mildred Gardner C40, violin; Rob-
ert Brown C39, ’cellist, and Harry
Goldby C39, pianoforte, will in-
clude one movement from Mozart’s
Trio in B Flat and an introduc-
tory largo from a chamber music
work by a 17th century Belgian,
Loeillet. In addition, Goldby will
perform Bach’s G Minor Prelude
arranged for piano by Siloti.

“We are trying to present pro-
grams that will appeal to every-
one from a musicologist to a per-
son who can just tap his feet in
approximate time,” stated Brown,
chairman of the concert hour com-
mittee. “For example, very few
people have ever heard this Bel-
gian"s works, one of the most
beautiful examples of three-part
writing in existence, while the
Schubert symphony is so well
known that I expect to hear
Tommy Dorsey come out with a
“swing arrangement of it any day.”

Concerts will be presented every
other Wednesday, and are open
to students and faculty.

Members of the committee in-
clude Brown, Goldby, Miss Gard-
ner, Denton Beal C39, Richard
Raley C39, Gertrude Broida C40,
and Stella Kaplan C39.

Panhel Council
Announces Contest

When the women’s fraternities
come together for their next mass
meeting, they will be offered two
new songs to add to their list.
These songs, to be written by the
fraternities, will be the winners
selected from a contest sponsored
by Panhellenic Council.

Two types of songs are eligible
for the contest. One should be
stately and rather formal—the
kind of composition that would be
suitable on any serious occasion.
The other may be as catchy and
clever as the writer choses to
make it.

One of each type will be select-
ed two weeks before the mass
meeting, by a committee of judges,
as yet unannounced. During the
meeting, mimeographed copies of
