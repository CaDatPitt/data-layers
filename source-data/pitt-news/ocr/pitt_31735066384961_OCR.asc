IFC votes down party advertising policy

By Michele Quinn
Staff Writer

Last night, the lnter—Fraternity
Council voted down a proposal
to prohibit public advertising for
fraternity social functions serving
alcohol.

"We're concerned with adver-
tising before the event occurs,”
said Chuck Farinella, lFC presi-
dent. "If one fraternity goes down
for underage drinking the univer-
sity will probably draw the line
and we will all suffer."

The issue was first introduced
at the Gavel Club meeting on
Monday night. Fraternity presi-
dents voiced their concern about
underage drinking in the fraterni-
ties, public disturbances and
community relations.

Most members were worried
that an incident such as the one
which occured at a fraternity
party on the Carnegie Melon
University campus last year
would occur at Pitt. This incident
involved a party which was raid-

ed by the police. Studentswere
arrested and the fraternity was
penalized. Many people ques-
tioned whether this incident
would have occurred if there had
not been extensive advertising.

”There is still a chance that
what happened at CMU could
happen here,” Farinella said.

According to Farinella police
recently‘ raided an apartment
party in North Oakland. Farinel-
la and other board members were
worried that the police will start
cracking down on social events
on campus as well. Farinella ad-
ded that advertising may make it
easier for authorities to locate and
investigate such events.

Most of the fraternity members
in attendance at the meeting were
against such a proposal.

"lt seems so negative. Soon
we're going to be yanking letters
off our houses, putting up funer-
al home signs and smuggling
people into the house in caskets,”
commented Tim McLaughlin of
Phi Delta Theta.

Other members argued that the
proposal would infringe on the
social aspects of fraternity events.
Without advertising in local me-
dia, fraternities — especially
those located in the North Oak-
land area —— would be unable to
inform as many people about the
event

"The Pitt News is the only way
fraternities in North Oakland
have of getting people over
there,” said Ron Bizick, IFC
representative.

However, Farinella pointed out
the disadvantages of the media.

”Approximately 16,000 copies
of The Pitt News are put out.
They're free. People pick them
up. Already we have had high
school girls at our parties," he
commented.

Farinella went on to explain
that many high school students
use The Pitt News classified sec-
tion to find out when fraternities
are having parties. The
newspaper issues are circulated
throughout Squirrel Hill, Shady-

side and surrounding areas.

”By not advertising hopefully
fraternities would be able to con-
trol and contain parties. They will
know who is going to be there,”
Farinella said.

Discussions were held during
the council meeting in order to
define ”public advertising.”
Some members questioned
whether the distribution of t-
shirts, cards, or leaflets would be
considered advertising.

Also, during last night's meet-
ing, the phrase ”media related
advertising” was substituted for
"public advertising.” The bylaws
had already stated that fraternities
were not allowed to use the
words "alcohol/’ ”alcoholic
beverages,” or ”parties" in any
advertisements.

The proposal was voted down
with the suggestion that the ex-
ecutive board research alternative
forms of ”advertisements," such
as private invitations and a bulle-
tin board for social events in the
Litchfield Towers.

Dukakis
addresses
campaign
office

By Scot Ross

News Editor

The 1988 presidential race
took a personal turn for the
citizens of Pittsburgh last night as
Kitty Dukakis addressed a crowd
at the opening of the Pittsburgh's
campaign headquarters.

Echoing the message of her
husband and his plan of ”eco-
nomic opportunity,” Dukakis
opened with a strong message on
voter participation. ”This Novem-
ber, Michael Dukakis and Lloyd
Bentsen are contesting for every
county and every state in our land
and they are not conceding a sin-
gle vote to the Republicans.”

The Democrat ticket garnered
support from Pittsburgh Mayor
Sophie Masloff, who said, ”No
question he's a winner. Absolute-
ly. He's got a good campaign and
I think he's going to be a winner.
It's time for a change."

”There’s a lot of things he can

a do [for Pennsylvania]/' Masloff

said. "We need a lot of jobs and
we need some money. We need
some federal money for housing.
We've got to get it from the fed-
eral government and I'm sure [if
elected} he'll get it."

"We have begun to think about
the United States of America as
a large classroom,"Mrs. Dukakis
said, ”and no lesson in that class-
room has been more significant
than the real importance of mak-
ing the ’American Dream’ a real-
ity for all our families.”

She described this ’dream’ as
economic stability for all citizens,
reasonably priced health insur-
ance, quality child care, school-
yards and streets that are drug
free, a nation without homeless-
ness and respect for the law.

Michael Dukakis has pinpoint-
ed education as one of his biggest
concerns and his wife made
much of the issue as well.

"The words ‘educated in
America’ mean that our children
are the best trained and the best
educated and prepared on the
face of the earth."

The problem of low and mid-
dle income families paying for
higher education is a part of the
Dukakis platform that has been
scrutinized by aspiring college
academicians and their families.

When asked what her husband
planned to do for college finan-
cial aid she replied, "First of all,

he's going to stop the assault of .

Westinghouse andGerman firm to combine

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Westing-
house Electric Corp. and AEG Ak-
tiengesellschaft of West Germany
said Tuesday they have signed a
final agreement to combine their
mass transportation businesses.

The agreement, announced in
February, gives AEG controlling
interest in the joint venture con-
sisting of AEG Westinghouse
Transportation Systems Inc. of
Pittsburgh, AEG Westinghouse
Transport-Systems GmbH of
West Berlin, Magnetic Transit of
America Inc. of Los Angeles and
Magnetbahn GmnH of Starns-
berg, West Germany.

The companies said the new
firm will develop mass transit
propulsion and auxiliary systems,
power supplies, automatic train
controls, automated people-
mover systems and magnetic levi-
tation technology.

The terms of the transaction
were not disclosed.

Computer shortage
in American schools

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ Ameri-
can schools have only one com-

puter for every 30 students, and
even those pupils with access to
computers get to use them an
average of just one hour a week,
a report to Congress said
yesterday.

The report by the congression-
al Office of Technology Assess-
ment said that ”today’s
classrooms typically resemble
their ancestors of 50 years ago
more closely than operating
rooms or business offices resem-
ble their 1938 versions.”

The agency estimated that
schools have spent $2 billion on
computer hardware over the past
decade. There are now 1.2 mil-
lion to 1.7 million computers in
public schools, and fewer than
five percent have no computers.

But the agency said it would
cost $4 billion to buy enough
equipment to reduce the student-
computer ratio from 30-1 to 3-1.

der legislation proposed Tuesday
by a state senator.

A legislative package spon-
sored by Sen. Edward Helfrick, R-
Northumberland, would also
give additional prosecutorial
tools to local district attorneys
and provide funds for drug-
education programs, a statement
from his office said.

Specifically, the bill calls for
anyone convicted of leading a
narcotics trafficking network to
be subject to a minimum 20-year
sentence, with 10 years manda-
tory before parole. There is no
comparable law currently in
place in the state.

Soviet corruption
trial in second day

MOSCOW (AP) — The govern-
ment charged today that cash,
jewelry, fine wines and fruits
were given to the nation's form-
er chief law enforcement officer
by defendants in the influence-

peddling trial of Leonid I. Brezh-
nev’s son-in-law.

As the trial before a three-
member military tribunal entered
its second day, prosecutors al-
leged defendants gave former In-
terior Minister Nikolai
Shchelokov, then the Soviet Un-
ion’s top police officer and a pro-
tege of Brezhnev, gifts ranging
from neckties to three pearls
valued at $5,300 each.

The charges provided the most
detailed account yet of official
corruption at the top levels of the
Brezhnev regime.

The central figure among the
nine defendants, 51-year-old Yuri
Churbanov, was Shche|okov’s
deputy and could face the death
penalty if convicted on charges
he accepted bribes and gifts such
as wine, cognac and grapes flown
to him via the Soviet airline Aer-
oflot from Uzbekistan.

Freshmen continue to
participate on campus

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

Membership in some of Pitt's
largest student organizations re-
mains strong as the fall semester
gets underway.

Leaders and spokespeople
from the Student Government
Board, the Black Action Society,
the New Student Network and
WPTS FM agreed that the fresh-
man Activities Fair, held on Aug.
30, helped in making students
aware of their organizations and
provided students an opportuni-
ty to get involved.

SGB president Craig Jackson
said that ”a lot of freshmen
signed up” to be part of the
board. Jackson continued by ex-
plaining that once freshmen de-
cide to join,-they must first go
through a brief training period to
acquaint themselves with univer-
sity policy.

”We want freshmen who want
to get involved, [but] to have
[them] involved is tough. They
don't know university policy,”
said Jackson.

Jackson explained that fresh-
men learn procedures by taking
notes from current board mem-
bers and are also grouped
together, elect their own presi-
dent and partake to a lesser
degree in SGB projects.

For example, said Jackson, last
year the freshman‘ group called
people living in Pitt's dorms and
surveyed the living conditions.

Jackson said that membership

"ﬁr ,
..

in the SGB has been consistently
strong and that no one who
served last year on the allocations
committee dropped out.

BAS membership chairperson
Dawn Hill said that this year,
about 50 to 100 people signed up
to join her organization and that
this is higher than usual.

She said that, although the Ac-
tivities Fair was helpful, about 50
people visited the BAS office last
week.

Hill explained that when fresh-
men join the BAS, they are asked
of which committee within the
BAS they would prefer to be a
part. From there, they are circu-
lated within the BAS and are
asked to attend group meetings
regularly.

Additional lot may nix tailgating

By Jason Hillman
Staff Writer

Another parking lot is con-
sidering prohibiting tailgating
on its premises during Pitt
football games.

Charles Graham, the direc-
tor of property management
for Pitt, said that the university-
owned parking lot on the
corner of University Place and
Fifth Avenue, next to Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial, may no
longer be open for tailgating.

As reported in yesterday's
Pitt News, the parking lot next
to the Syria Mosque now pro-
hibits tailgating. An official
from William Penn Parking
Lots,\the company that runs
the Syria Mosque lot, said the
reasons for the new rule were

complaints from neighbors
about the noise, damage to
parked not owned by the tail-
gaters, and the trash that the

tailgaters often left behind in
the lot and in neighboring
areas.

Since the Syria Mosque lot
was closed to tailgating, many
tailgaters went to the Univer-
sity and Fifth parking lot for
last Saturday’s game. Two at-
tendants, who wished to re-
main unidentified and who
supervised the lot during the
tailgates, commented in
yesterday's Pitt News that the
tailgating was a ”problem.”

”We charge [the tailgaters]
to park like everybody else,”
said one of the attendants.
”Two kids will come in with
a van or a truck, and all of a

sudden there are 50 people
standing there. I would say
that some of the people who
would normally park here are
just driving by because they
see all this.”

”We haven't had a chance
to investigate,” said Graham,
”but I heard it was somewhat
disruptive. I don't believe we
will permit tailgating in the
future.”

Many Pitt students are con-
cerned about the closing of
parking lots to tailgaters.

’’I think it's wrong [to»pro—
hibit tailgaters] because it's
like a way of celebration,”
said Tony Palombi, a sopho-
more at Pitt. ”|t’s the way col-
lege students celebrate. That's
their way of showing their
spirit. ”

Crash victims vow against airshows

By DAVID SEDENO

Associated Press Writer

SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) —
An American couple recovering
from burns suffered during an air
show crash in West Germany
said Tuesday they still wonder
how they survived the disaster
and vowed never to attend
another aerobatic exhibition.

Air Force Sgt. Jeffrey McCanch,

23, and his wife, Tammy
McCanch, 21, and their
28-month-old son, Jeffrey

McCanch II, are among a group
of Americans being treated at the
burn unit of Brooke Army Medi-
cal Center. '

The McCanches were among
several hundred spectators in-
jured Aug. 28 when three Italian
jets crashed during a demonstra-
tion at Ramstein Air Force Base,
West Germany. More than 40
people died.

McCanch said he and his fami-
ly were sitting in a group when
the crash occurred and that parts
of the aircraft landed about 30
feet near them.

The McCanchs suffered burns
to their hands, but their son, who
was asleep on the ground at the
time of the crash, suffered burns
to his face, neck, back, legs and
chest.

”It was just like a nightmare,”

Ms. McCanch said. ”When I was
laying there on the ground  I
just kept on saying, ‘This is not
real. It's not happening.”

Both McCanches said they
would never go to another air
show as spectators, but they dis-
agreed on whether air shows
should be banned.

’’I don’t think there is a purpose
for them,” said Ms. McCanch,
whose parents live in Indianapo-
lis, Ind.

But her husband, who is as-
signed to bomb disposal unit at
Kapaun Air Station near Ram-
stein, said the public is interest-
ed in the expensive aircraft.

”It shows the public the capa-
bilities of the aircraft. I know the
public would like to find out
more what the capablities does
an F-I6 have,” McCanch said.

”They want to see if they can
really do a vertical climb from an
X amount of miles and they get
can go to the air shows and find
out that they can really do some
things and it serves a good pur-
pose like that,” he said.

McCanch said that he was try-
ing to take pictures with a small
camera when he saw the aircraft
collide.

He said the impact knocked
them several feet away from their
son and he had to race back to
pick him up.

”There was no reaction time,”
said McCanch, a native of Saxon-
burg, Pa. ”As I was flying through
the air, I was telling my wife that
it was going to be OK.

”After I saw my wife was fine
I got up real quick and I thought
the first thing was to get back and
grab our son and take him out,"
he said.

McCanch said after he got his
wife and child to a Red Cross
shelter he wanted to go back and
help others, but medical person-
nel did not let him.

After their son's condition
stabilized, the three were flown
to the Texas burn unit.

Their son had a skin graft
Tuesday.

”He’s doing fine. He sees us all
the time. He wants to be with us
as much as we can,” Ms.
McCanch said.

McCanch, who has been in
West Germany two years, said he
has requested a transfer to Lack-
land Air Force Base in San
Antonio.

U.S.S.R. tour, suggested leaving
the hotel and exploring Moscow
for an evening. I had accepted the
invitation wholeheartedly.

All of the Russian spy stories I
had heard had begun to play on
my imagination. I had half-
convinced myself that the Rus-
sians behind the desks, in the lob-
by and in the hallways were all
spies watching, listening and
waiting for one of us to pass on
secret information or stuff defec-
tors into our backpacks.

My roommate and I had even
started to talk to the ”bug” in our
room.

”We’re going to dinner now.
Please make our beds while
we’re gone,” we would say loud-
ly as we shut the room door. We
were joking, but also wondering.

Andy and I had learned the
transit system well enough during
the past two days to find our way
down to Red Square. We walked
along the icy sidewalks uncons-
ciously taking on the mannerisms
of many Russians: tucking our
chins into the collars of our coats,
burying our hands deep into our
pockets — trying to find warmth
against the bitter winter wind.

The streets were empty and
quiet, except for the occasional
muffled noise of tires moving
along on the packed snow. We
heard the cars before we saw
them. Most drivers did not use
their headlights except to flash at
overanxious pedestrians trying to

cross the street.

We began to circle the Krem-
lin Wall, first stopping at the
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,
watching the bright flame cast
shadows over the frozen wreaths
of roses. The Kremlin Wall, a
solid fortress against the outside
world, towered behind.

Andy and I began walking
again along the path. Trees
loomed up on each side, their
black, leafless branches sprawl-
ing out in all directions. I felt as
if I were in the haunted forest in
The Wizard of Oz and those trees
were about to spring alive, grab
us and throw us over the wall.

Suddenly, the quiet was broken
by a piercing scream. Up ahead,
we saw a dark figure apppear
from one side of the path, cross
it, and disappear into the trees on
the other side.

We quickened our pace and,
coming upon the spot where the
figure had appeared, we stopped
and searched the hill into the
trees which circled the wall.

We heard a quick shout and
jumped back as a little boy
dressed in dark clothes slid down
the hill, across the path and into
a small parting where he fell into
a big pile of snow. His oversized,
black rubber galoshes enabled
him to slide standing up on the

We looked up again into the
trees and saw a small group of
people waiting their turn to slide
down. They huddled together
and quietly giggled as one little
girl slid by us, her smiling face
peeking out from the collar of her
coat.

At that moment, I smiled and
forgot about the spy stories and
tales of drudgery behind the Iron
Curtain. Instead, I remembered
myself as a little girl, sliding down
the hills of the park in my
hometown.

Perry attempts - media comeback

PITTSBURGH (AP) - Nick Per-
ry, caught in the Pennsylvania
Lottery's infamous ”666” scandal
in 1980, is making a comeback
to television 3 not as a newsman
or with the lottery, but as host of
a bowling show on cable tele-
vision.

’’I was apprehensive. You
could say I still am,” Perry said.
”Everybody doesn't love every-
body else. There's bound to be
somebody out there dissatisfied
with my coming back.”

Perry, 71, returned to the air
Monday night on ”BPA Jackpot
Bowling,” a twice-nightly show
similar to ’’Bowling for Dollars”
programs seen frequently on tel-
evision.

The program, produced by the
Pittsburgh chapter of the Bowling
Proprietors of America, can be
seen at 6:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. on
the KBL cable channel in the
Pittsburgh area. Perry has taped
30 of 64 programs scheduled for
the initial 13-week run.

”The first couple of shows
were a little rough because it was
difficult for me to get back into
the swing of things. I felt like I
could crawl into a hole and pull
it right behind me,” Perry said.

Perry was host of the nightly
lottery telecast and a staff an-
nouncer on Pittsburgh station
WTAE-TV when the daily lottery
number came up 666 on April
24, 1980. Perry and several other
men were arrested and convict-

ed in the rigging of the lottery
drawing.

Perry, sentenced to a three— to
seven-year term, served two years
at Camp Hill State Correctional
Institution and another year at a
Pittsburgh halfway house not far
from his home. He now super-
vises couriers for a medical test-
ing company in suburban Ross
Township.

Perry still insists he is innocent
of the charges.

”No one in my family and
none of my close friends ever hit
the three sixes,” he said. ”Why
wouldn't I give it to them 3 my fa-
mily, who could have used the
money°”

Perry hosted a local ”Bowling
for Dollars” program in Pitts-
burgh before his arrest and was
encouraged to do the new pro-
gram by Dick Clouser, president
of Unitel Mobile Video.

”I didn't know if I wanted to go
back on TV.  I didn't know
what my acceptance would be,"
Perry said. ”I didn't know if I
wanted to hear about what hap-
pened to me and all the incidents
and have it rehashed again.”

Perry said, for example, he was
listening to a popular Pittsburgh
radio station the last time that 666
came up in the lottery.

”And the star said, ’I wonder
how many times three sixes has
come up. I should call Nick Per-
ry and ask him.’ These kind of
things are uncalled for, to get

Hill said that the BAS lost no
members over the summer other
than to graduation and that
”traditionally, membership has
been strong.”

Entering its first year as an offi-
cial university organization, the
NSN, a campus human rights or-
ganization, faired well in attract-
ing new membership at the
activities fair, according to group
president Angie Hirsch.

She said that about 35 people
expressed interest in joining at
the fair.

Most freshmen present at the
fair said they felt that a campus
human rights group was a good
idea, according to Hirsch, but
that a few people did walk away
when they found that the NSN
was a political organization.

Hirsch said that, at the fair, she
’’talked to people from other or-
ganizations, and they seemed to
be getting similar numbers.”

Hirsch added that next week,
the NSN will be holding a recep-
tion for new members in the
Kurtzman Room of the William
Pitt Union. The reception will ac-
quaint new members with the
NSN, she said.

About 150 to 200 people have
displayed interest in joining Pitt's
campus radio station, WPTS FM,
so far this fall, according to pro-
gram director Bob Backer.

Backer said that, last year, the
station did equally well in recruit-
ing new members but that two
years ago, only about 60 people
showed serious interest in
joining.

Out of these 200 people, said
Backer, only about 24 will be
chosen to become disc jockeys.
These 24 people will then spend
one semester learning on-the-air
proceedures. Those not chosen
for DJ positions may filter into
other production positions.

Backer added that joining

WPTS is usually very popular
with freshmen.

”lf freshmen are interested,
now is the time [to join],” he said.

WPTS lost 30 percent of its staff
over the summer due to
graduation.

Perry said when he hears jokes
about himself on the street, ’’I just
ignore it and keep on walking. If
I would stop, I'm afraid of what
would happen.”

But Perry said he is not bitter.

”I don't worry about the past.
My philosophy is just work in the
present and look forward to the
future. When you try to live in the
past, you grow old too fast and
there's no gain,” he said.

”I can honestly say I have no
vindictiveness in me. I don't hate
the people involved and I feel
God willed it that way,” he said.

Perry said he is now ”open to
anything” on television and is
very happy for his bowling show
for now.

”I would enjoy doing a
newscast, but I know I'll never
get it,” he said. ”I just want them
to say, ‘It's good to have Nick
back again.’ ”

Checking up on the
banks a good idea

In August of this year, Congress passed the Expedited Funds
Availability Act, which requires banks and credit unions to
sharply decrease the amount of time they can hold funds
deposited in the form of checks. ‘

Many of us have witnessed the ugly scenes at our local banks
when a customer iscomplaining with greatvigor about the de-
lays he has experienced in getting deposited funds into his ac-
count. Surely, most have at some time sweated out the
seven—day hold on a check drawn on a bank across the street.

In many institutions, there has even been a week-long hold
placed on checks drawn on the same bank.

Under the provisions of the EFA Act, banks can now only
place a three-day hold on local checks and no more than a
seven-day hold on non-local checks. Within two years, those
limits will decrease to two days for local checks and no more
than five days for non-local checks.

It seems reasonable to expect a bank to hold a check for a
small amount of time after it has been deposited. There are sur-
ely enough bad checks written’ every day to make some wait
worthwhile. However, a consumer advocate group found that
banks are collecting roughly $290 million each year in interest
on the funds collected for a check not yet deposited in the cus-
tomer's account. An additional $145 million was found to have
been collected in non-sufficient funds charges levied against
accounts waiting for money deposited sometimes two weeks
before a check is written. '

It is one thing for a bank to defend itself against bad checks.
It is quite another for them to get richer by holding on to funds
from good ones. It is pleasant to see that Congress has correct-
ed what had become an indefensible practice.

In a nutshell...

”The average man, who does not know what to do with
his life, wants another one which will last forever.”

—— Anatole France

Don't turn the TV off, just change the

The networks are terribly wor-
ried about losing their audiences
these days. Between the writers’
strike, cable television, VCR
machines and independent
programming, the American peo-
ple are having an entertainment
orgy and driving television
moguls up the wall.

Probably what affects TV more
than anything else is the remote-
control clicker, which has put all
programming decisions into the
hands of the viewer.

Before its arrival, most people,
particularly men, were too lazy to
get out of their chairs or beds to
alter the channel. Sometimes the
set stayed on the same station for
weeks. But this has all changed
since some genius invented the

How does he operate?

For starters, he practices on the

More than a few years have

school. Those special years when
a youngster leaves the neighbor-

educational environment are so
important to the development of
an individual.

At the age of 6, the world out-

wonderland where new friends
could be made and new interests
and hobbies pursued. Each new
day was supposed to bring a
challenge to learn more and ex-

When I attended St. Phillip, the
diocese’s policy was that the first
two years of education were to be
performed solely by nuns.
Perhaps it was the same for some
of you reading this, or similar.

Nuns, the last that I heard, are
women who have devoted their
earthly lives to the service of
God. I'm not sure how much they
are remunerated for their service
as teachers; I'm guessing if I say
it's a pittance.

Other memories: if a child's
gaze left the textbook during the

who was condemned to go sever-

Once you start clicking, you have
to keep doing it to assure your-
self that you're not missing any-

Liberati tries comeback after year layoff

By Mike Rampa

For The Pitt News

Sweeper fullback Dan Liberati
has high hopes for the 1988 soc-
cer season. Liberati missed last
season due to academic difficul-
ties. His absence from collegiate
soccer seems to have given him
added optimism and a very com-
petitve attitude going into the '88
campaign.

”We have the players for a
potentially good season. I'm very
optimistic about playing this year.
As far as individual positions go,

we have some good players,”
Liberati said. ”I think chemistry
among the team is very important
and I think we've developed
that.”

Two of Pitt's top recruits are
Heinz Pak and Mark Mostinckx.
The two Community College of
Allegheny County transfers will
provide an experienced one-two
punch to the Panther offense.
”They definitely have an impact
on our midfie|d,” said Liberati.

"They’re very good finishers on
goal. Both of them have a very
good shot. If they fit in well,

Brister’s fiery style has
Steelers fans, players
looking forward to ’88

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer

”A young starting quarterback
isn't supposed to do this well,"
was the remark a reporter threw
at Steeler Bubby Brister following
Pittsburgh's 24-21 win over the
Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.

But Brister did do well, satiat-
ing the quarterback—hungry fans
and reporters of Pittsburgh for the
first time since the early 1980's.

”Pisses ya’|| off, doesn't it?"

That's Bubby for ya. Says what
he thinks. Says what he feels. In-
troducing Mr. Cut-and-Dry as the
newest quarterback of the Pitts-
burgh Steelers.

Actually, Bubby Brister wasn't
expected to lead the team to its
second consecutive opening day
win. He was only expected to
contribute to the overall cause.
Call the signals. Complete a few
passes. Hand the ball off to the
running backs and not make any
waves.

Heck with that, Brister says.
This is his team. He is responsi-
ble for what goes on out there.
And if his job on the football
team is to help score points, then,
by golly, that's what he's gonna
do.

The Dallas defense figured it
would have its way with the
third-year pro out of Northeast
Louisiana. After all, ,he started
only two games in 1986 and saw
brief action -— two fourth—quarter
appearances — in all of 1987. So
the Cowboys blitzed their Span-
jans off throughout much of the

game, knocking Brister on his can
countless times, although never
sacking him.

The bruise tactic didn't work.
And that's why Pittsburgh is 1-0
and the ’Pokes are 0-1.

”They gave us lots of different
looks," said Brister. ”They blitzed
a ton, but we picked it up pretty
good. I got dazed a few times, but
I just dragged my butt off the
ground and got to it again.”

What Brister adds to the Steel-
er offense is something that's
been missing since Terry Brad-
shaw made his heroic last appear-
ance after elbow surgery in 1983.
And that intangible, ladies and
gentlemen of the jury, is en-
thusiasm.

”His tempo is infectious,” says
Steeler coach Chuck Noll, ”and
it kind of inspires the rest of our
people.”

”After we scored that first
touchdown, I said, ’Jeez, this is
fun. Let's get back out there and
do it again.’ I hadn't felt that way
about the game in a long time,”
says center Mike Webster.

’’I’m having fun out there,”
says Brister. "And that's a big part
of football. When it stops being
fun, then it's time to quit playing.

’’I know the system now. I'm
bigger, I'm stronger. I'm better
suited to play. We're having good
execution for everybody being so
young. The line did a good job,
the backs picked up blitzes. They
did an excellent job. Our
offense is stretching so many peo-
ple so many different ways.”

Please see Brister, page 12

which they should, they will help
us tremendously," he added.
Mostinckx, a center midfielder,
has played in Belgium and
throughout Europe, which consti-
tutes a good deal of beneficial ex-
perience in Liberati’s eyes. He
should prove to be a valuable as-
set to the relatively young Panther
team by bringing his overseas
playing experiences to Pitt.

into the Panther offense as a left
midfielder and should help to
strengthen the Panthers’ offensive
line. Hard shots on goal from a

Ieft—footed kicker, which is a valu-
able trait to possess in an offen-
sive line, is something opposing
goaltenders will have to reckon
with this season.

Liberati has a great amount of
confidence in this year's
goalkeeping staff. He states, ”I’m
not going to single out one goalie
and say ‘He's the best.’ I feel
comfortable with any of the three
in goal. They're all very capable
of performing well." Such confi-
dence expressed by Liberati, one
of the Panthers’ leading
defenders, is reassuring consider-

ing that if one goalkeeper must
miss a game, there are two pairs
of very capable feet (not to men-
tion hands) to fill the vacant
shoes. '
When asked which opponen

would be most difficult to handle
this season, Liberati stated, ”Any
of the Division I schools we play
will be strong, especially the Big
East teams." According tq Liber-
ati, last year's number—four—
ranked team, Seton Hall, may not
prove to be as large of a threat
this year because of a loss of play-

Quarterback Bubby Brister will make Steeler games a little more interesting this season.

Volleyball team looks to continue

By Ed Kuznik
For The Pitt News

In 1987, the University of Pitts-
burgh women’s volleyball squad
garnered a 37‘6 record, a No. 1
ranking in the East and a berth in
the NCAA Tournament — seem-
ingly a climax for any program.

But Pitt head coach Shelton
Collier feels his current squad
could even surpass these accom-
p I i s h m e n t s .

”By the end of the season, this
could be the most successful
team in Pitt volleyball history,”
Collier said after the Lady Pan-
thers racked up two straight-set
victories and won the Ball State
Classic this past weekend. ” We

have a long way to go, but the
potential is there.”

Pitt began play in the tourna-
ment by defeating Indianapolis
University 3-0 (15-13,15-4,
15-11), andthen hung on to beat
a tough Illinois State team 3-0
(15-13,15—7,16-14) in the cham-
pionship encounter.

Denise Frawley, Kelly Matheis,
Dee MacAulay, Nora Mulvihill,
Lori Silk, Jenelle Lantagne and
Michele Adamson all played key
roles. Frawley (the tournament
MVP with 22 kills, even though
she did not play against Indi-
anapolis), Matheis (18 kills and
selected to the All-Tournament
team) and MacAuley (12 kills,
All-Tourney) were the top guns

statistically.

Collier lauded the play of that
trio recently.

”|t’s interesting because all
three have quite different per-
spectives with Pitt volleyball,” he
said. ”Denise is a senior All-
American candidate and an es-
tablished, nationally known play-
er, whereas this was Dee
MacAulay’s first collegiate tour-
nament. She was a very average
high school player that somehow
has developed into a nationally
competitive player.

”I’m sure we'll be counting on
all three all year long.”

Despite the optimism emanat-
ed by Collier, the ninth-year
coach realizes that his squad has

not yet faced the cream of the
NCAA crop. To top that off, he
must deal with the fact that the
team has been somewhat deci-

mated from last year due to the

graduation of four seniors.

But there will be no uncertainty
about those things this time next
week, as looming this weekend
is a gargantuan encounter with
three of the giants in the volley-
ball world: Brigham Young
University, Texas and the Univer-
sity of Pacific, in a tournament
which will be held in Utah.

SUCCESS

”This is the most inexperienced
team I ever coached, but we
found a way to win the close
games (at the Ball State tourney),
and that's a great sign,” Collier
said.

”The tournament coming up is I

one where we're not expected to
win any matches by virtue of the
fact that all three teams are in the
Top 10. We are very much in the
upset role,’’ he added.

”We’d like to upsetone of the
teams in the Top 10 so that we
could get in the national rankings
ourselves. If we don't get an up-
set, we still have to play well so
that we can carry that through the
season.”

ers to graduation. Also, several
key Irish players are gone be-
cause their coach left and is now
at Boston College.

However, Liberati is not count-
ing Seton Hall out as a major
threat in the Big East. ”Who
knows who they're getting in.
They might be getting another
group of Irish players. They
should still be strong.”

The fact that Liberati plays soc-
cer in a stadium where the atten-
dance averages around 100 per
game, while football and basket-
ball contests are consistent sel-
louts, does not bother him. He
attributes the small crowds to two
key reasons. ”The game [soccer]
hasn’t caught on in this country.
Football, baseball and basketball
will always be the big sports, I
think.”

The other reason: soccer is
simply not one of Pitt's bigger
sports. Liberati comments, ”I was
recruited by Indiana; I was look-
ing at Duke and Penn State. Penn
State has its own soccer stadium.
They have their own field. It's in-
credible. At games, when they're
playing another top Division I
school, they'll get a couple thou-
sand people at the game; they'll
fill the place up. I have a team
poster of Duke from four years
ago, and there were at least five
or 6,000 people in the stands.”

Liberati ignores the attendance
factor and concentrates instead
on personal and team develop-
ment and achievement. ”It comes
down to the point where you take
pride in your playing. And even
if no one comes to watch you,
you want to do well for yourself

, and as a team.”

Steelers

PITTSBURGH (AP) ~ The
Pittsburgh Steelers Tuesday
waived injured tight end Dan-
zell Lee, signed defensive line-
man free agent Rollin Putzier,
and placed defensive lineman
Lorenzo Freeman on the in-
jured reserve list.

Lee, in his second year out
of Lamar, started 13 games last
year, catching 12 passes, after
joining the replacement team.
He was on the team's injured
reserve list this season.

Putzier, 6-foot-4 and 279
pounds, out of Oregon, was
waived by Packers on Aug.
29. He was the Packers’
fourth-round draft pick.

Freeman is in his second
year after joining the Steelers
as a free agent last year. He
was the Packers’ fourth-round
draft pick in 1987 out of the
University of Pittsburgh.

Freeman hurt his ankle in
practice last Friday, according
to team spokesman Dan
Edwards.

 

Liberati feels that this year's
preseason camp has been the
most competitive in a while. ”lt’s
been a tough camp. Guys are
really working hard. This is the
most competitive year since I've
been at Pitt." Players are still
fighting for starting spots within
an extremely competitive in-
trasquad team.

Liberati feels that defense will
be the team's strong point, while
Coach Joe Luxbacher is still iron-
ing out the offense. Liberati is
confident that Luxbacher will
continue to pick up the soccer
program and carry it a long way.

”This is my last year playing,
and I'd really like to see the team
do well. I'd like to do well in-
dividually also. Hopefully, the
Pitt soccer program will grow; it
has since I was a freshman. I'd
just like to see it get better. I think
Joe [Luxbacher] is the kind of guy
who will take it up from here.”

Backed by strong recruiting of
Pak and Mostincyx, solid defense
and Liberati’s extremely mature
and professional approach to his
final season, Luxbacher may car-
ry the Panther soccer program a
step further.

He also scrambled 13 yards for
a first down that kept alive the

Brister’s cockiness behind

minute before the end of the first

DETROIT — The cracks in the
Detroit Tigers’ already thin armor
began to show in August. Now
those cracks have become gaps
that even a managerial magician
like Sparky Anderson may be un-
able to repair. a

The Tigers, who clung to the
American League East lead while
losing 11 of their last 13 games,
finally were caught Sunday by the
Boston Red Sox. The two entered
play Monday tied for the division
lead.

”We just have too many inju-
ries right now,” Anderson said.
’’I’d like to go with a set lineup
the rest of the way, but I can't. But
there's no use crying about it. I'm
sure they ain't gonna worry about
it in New York or Boston.”

er was the latest to go down ——

Freak injuries and lack of hitting
cause Tigers to topple from lead

in his right knee while dancing
and doing splits at an anniversary
party he attended with his wife af-
ter the Tigers’ loss Saturday night
to the Milwaukee Brewers. He’s
out 10 days to two weeks.

The Tigers as a team are hitting

‘.255, third to last in the 14-tea

American League. a

’’I still think we’ve got a good
team on the field, but nobody’s
hitting, and the pitchers are just
kind of suffocating. They know if
they fall behind, it's going to be
a long game,” third baseman
Tom Brookens said.

The pitching staff, which was
most responsible for getting the
Tigers to first place and keeping
them there, has fallen on hard
times.

Second—year starter Jeff Robin-
son, 13-6 with a 2.98 ERA, hasn’t
started since being bothered by
two inflamed fingers on his pitch-
ing hand; Frank Tanana, 14-9
with a 4.25 ERA; and Eric King,

3-1, 3.65 ERA since being called
up from Toledo, each missed a
turn with a stiff shoulder.

General Manager Bill Lajoie fi-
nally landed some help in an
eleventh-hour trade last week
with Baltimore that brought Fred
Lynn, 18 home runs, 38 RBI, to
Detroit. But Lynn hits from the
left side, and what the Tigers lost
when free agent Kirk Gibson
went to the Los Angeles Dodgers
was right—handed power.

The deal lost some of its luster
because the chartered jet bring-
ing Lynn from the West Coast,
where the Orioles were playing,
radioed Chicago, where the
Tigers had last played, 10
minutes after the midnight Sept.
1 trading deadline. That made
Lynn ineligible for the playoffs.

’’It certainly would be nice to
be a part of that,” Lynn said. ”But
right now, the important thing is
getting there, not who plays in
it.”

Thomas expected to miss season
as Paterno sets opening lineup

By David S. Martin

Associated Press Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) —
Penn State will start the season at
Virginia with Tom Bill at quarter-
back, Ray Tarasi kicking and a
large corp of freshmen involved
in pivotal roles, Coach Joe Pater-
no said Tuesday.

’’I don't think we've ever start-
ed a season with as many fresh-
men in key spots as we have right
now,” Paterno said at his week-
ly news conference.

Third—team All—American tail-
back Blair Thomas will not play
Saturday against Virginia and is
doubtful for the season, he said.

Paterno, who often has said he
would rather play someone a
week late rather than a day ear-
ly, conceded he was pressing
some freshmen into action before
they might be ready.

’’I think our freshman class is
going to have to be a big part of
any success we're going to have.
Some of them are going to have
to get good in a hurry,” Paterno
said.

In addition, Paterno has some
experienced players in unfamiliar
positions.

— Andre Collins, a safety last
year, will start at inside line-
backer

—— Bob Mrosko, a tight end last
year, will start at defensive tackle.

— Eddie Johnson, a cornerback
last year, will start at safety.

— Sherrod Rainge, a safety last

year, will start at cornerback.

Paterno, who is entering his
23rd season as head coach, said
Virginia will challenge the inex-
perienced team.

”We’re going to have a bunch
of uncertain kids. We're going to
have some people who are going
to be a little edgy. The only way
to offset that is to be as aggressive
as you can,” Paterno said.

Virginia defeated William &
Mary 31-23 Saturday in its season
openen

Bill, a junior, out-performed
senior Lance Lonergan in presea-
son to earn the starting quarter-
back spot, according to Paterno.

”l think he's done very, very
well this preseason and I think
he’s ready to do a good job for
us,” Paterno said.

’’I don't have any plans to al-
ternate or anything like that. 
You give a guy a job and unless
he doesn't play well or gets hurt,
he's going to be our quarter-
back,” he added.

Last year, Bill completed 16 of
36 passes for 247 yards and two
touchdowns. Lonergan complet-
ed the only pass he attemped last
year, for 12 yards.

Junior Ray Tarasi will handle
field goals and kickoffs for Penn
State, according to Paterno.

Last year, Tarasi kicked off for
the Lions and was their p|acekick—
er only in the three games when
Eric Etze was injured.

Tarasi made seven consecutive
point—after attempts and made 1

of 5 field goal tries, connecting
on a 33—yarder against West Vir-
ginia. He had two field goal at-
tempts blocked against
Pittsburgh.

Paterno said he talked to Tho-
mas on Monday and told the
senior to assume he would play
this year. Thomas, who led Penn
State last year with 1,414 yards,
had surgery on his right knee in
January.

"He's not ready to go and I
think it's extremely doubtful he’ll
go this year,” Paterno said.

Paterno added that he'll talk to
Thomas in January about whether
the senior wants to enter the NFL
draft this year or play another
year for Penn State.

Penn State finished 8-4 last sea-
son and lost 35-10 to Clemson in
the Citrus Bowl.

Women’s swim team
ready for big splash
in upcoming season

By Chris Bosak
Staff Writer

The Pitt women's swim
team has won the Big East ti-
tle six years in a row now,
which is quite an impressive
feat. But head coach David
Belowich won't rely on the
past performances of his team
to carry the Panthers through
another season.

No. He wants and expects
that ”lucky number seven.”

Belowich is relying on the
balance of returning swim-
mers and an outstanding
recruiting class this season.

”This is one of the better
recruiting years we've had, but
you can’t replace four years
experience,” said Belowich.

Sixteen swimmers return
from last year's championship
squad. Belowich is counting
on their experience, particular-
ly that of captains Trish Rick-
ery and Maureen Cleary, for
leadership in and out of the
pool.

Other important returning
seniors are Betsy Holbert and
Margie Taulick, Big East Diver
of the Year two years ago. -

Connor still favorite in America ’s Cup races

By Sid Moody

AP Sports Writer

SAN DIEGO — Dennis Con-
ner, almost as sure to win the
America's Cup as death and tax-
es, issued a warning on Tuesday
that is bound to be heard in any
sport: ”Until the race is over, it's
never over.”

He told a news conference on
the day before the Cup races be-
gan that he was in a no-win situ-
ation against New Zealand’s
far-out yacht.

’’If we win, it's because my
boat was faster, because you all
[the media] have told me that,”
Conner said. ’’If we lose, ol’ Den-
nis Iost the America's Cup
again.”

Conner, in his fifth Cup series,
is the only defending skipper to
lose the 137—year-old trophy and
the only challenger to win it
back. v

He is a prohibitive favorite to
keep the Cup for the San Diego
Yacht Club in the best-of-three
series. His opponent, Kiwi skip-
per David Barnes, told the con-
ference ”something very unusual

_ would have to happen” with the

weather to give New Zealand’s
133-foot monohull yacht a
chance against Conner’s catama-
ran, Stars & Stripes.

Although both yachts are at the
cutting edge of technology, a
monohull has as much chance
against a catamaran as a grand-
stand against a race horse.

Somewhat testily, Conner told
the media, ”there’s never asure
thing in a sailboat race.”

Sails have ripped, equipment
can break down.

”You can go in the wrong
direction. The other guy can out-
smart you,” he said.

”My attitude is I have to do
everything in my power to sail
the boat and take nothing for
granted. The idea is to win. I
never said I wanted to keep it
close. There's no extra credit for
that.

”There’s a fine balance be-
tween winning a race and press-
ing your boat to ultimate speed
at the risk of your equipment.
David is a very good match racer,
and I'm sure he has some tricks

up his sleeve. I'll try to stay clear
of him at the start.”

Barnes didn't roll up his sleeve,
saying only: “We have a pretty
good idea of the strengths of our
boat.”

Among others, those would
possibly be a better ability to han-
dle very light airs and a lumpy
sea, which could slow Conner’s
Stars & Stripes.The forecast was
for onshore winds of 12-18 knots
and northwesterlies at 10-15
knots farther out to sea on the
40-mile windward—leeward
course.

Even Bruce Farr, whose An-
napolis, Md., firm designed New
Zealand, predicts his boat will
lose by as much as an hour in any
normal conditions.

Barnes said he was not sure of
a finalruling on the sailing direc-
tions. New Zealand, which
brought the series about by twice
suing in court, is challenging a
protest section which would al-

absolve itself by making two cir-
cles. Thus, a fouling boat could

point for the team this year, ac-
cording to Belowich. Laurie
Walczak, who was All-
American her freshman year,
and Sandy Albright, who al-
ready holds two school
records, are expected to have
excellent seasons. Pam Mur-
phy, returning from an injury
last year, and Terry Ziggler, are
also expected to have a posi-
tive impact on the team this
year.

Key sophomores returning
to help the team include Liz
Sari, Theresa Piccalo and
Celeste Makiel. Makiel placed
first in the 500 freestyle in the
Big East last year.

Incoming freshman Karin
Masil, a national caliber
breaststroker who qualified for
the Olympic Trials, will also
be heavily relied on by Be-
lowich and his team.

Belowich always expects a
strong Villanova, as well as
Boston College, to be Pitt's
closest competition in the con-
ference.

But Pitt also faces stiff com-
petition from outside the Big
East. Virginia, which finished
seventh in the nation last year,
Ohio State (14th) and Penn
State, second in eastern
regionals, head the list of op-
ponents.

”We want to provide them
[Pitt] with the best competition
we can provide them with.
You can only get better by
competing with teams who
are as good as or better than
you are,” said Belowich.

Belowich expects many in-
dividual school records to be
broken this year. He said the
breaststroke, backstroke and
relay events could see new
best times by the end of the
