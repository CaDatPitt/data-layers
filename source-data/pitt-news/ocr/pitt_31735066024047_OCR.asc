UFO, ‘Expert’ May Be Possible Fraud

Pitt Program Council Cancels Lecture-

By SCOT STONE
V Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt Program Council (PPC)
canceled its UFO , presentation
Wednesday when they found out
that the featured speaker, Clark
McClelland, was not, exactly the
noted astronomer he claimed to be.

McClelland had billed himself as
Research
Astronomer” "at Pitt’s Allegheny
Observatory, a former aerospace
engineer at the ‘ National
Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion (NASA), and a participant in
509 rocket launchings.

According to Bill Jackson, Lec-
ture Committee Chairman on the
PPC, McClelland had been
scheduled to perform since last
spring, and he had been booked in
September.

“We took him on his word,”
Jackson said. “He sent us a lot of
literature on his program, and we
were very impressed. ' ’

“We especially liked the fact that
he had been a NASA engineer,
since we knew that NASA’s official
position on UFO’s was ‘no com-
ment,‘ ” Jackson added.

McClel1and’s credentials began
to unravel when a Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette reporter, Henry Pierce,
contacted George Gatewood at the
Allegheny Observatory to check up
on the “facts”‘of a Pitt new
release on the lecture. ’

“Henry Pierce called us up,”
Gatewood said, “and he said, ‘My
God, is all this stuff true,’ and_ I
said, ‘What stuff?’ He said, ‘The
part about him being a research
astronomer.’ I said, “Geez, that’s
not true. Why do you call me?’ He
said, ‘it’s in a Pitt News release,’
and I said, ‘Oh my God!’ ”

Gatewood said he contacted the
PPC about McClelland Tuesday,

and they immediately canceled the «
scheduled for the '

presentation
following night.

When McClelland was booked by
the PPC in September he signed a
contractthat promised him $1,000
for his performance and, according
to Andy Smith, Director of Student
Activities, that issue has not been
completely resolved.

“Like anything else, if there is
any misrepresentation in advertis-
ing, then there are mitigating fac-

tors which affect the contract,”
Smith said. “It’s a question that
will need to be discussed. It is not
sett-led, and we are still doing
research on his biography.”
McClelland himself is upset
about the situation and claims "that
he has been misinterpreted, and, in
fact, claims to have been‘in con-
sultation with an attorney about
whether grounds exist for a suit.
“It was a great disappointment
for me,” McClelland said in a
telephone interview. “They didn’t
give me an opportunity to come up
with my own side of this. What I
wanted to do was to supply Pitt
with documentation that would
show, without a shadow of a doubt,

that what I state l’ve done, and ,

what I state l’ve experienced, is in

fact more true than what the flyer =

said.”

The “flyer” McClelland referred ,
to is an extensive press release -‘
which states that McClelland is a *

recognized expert with 30 years ex-

_ perience in the fields of astronomy, .

space exploration and UFO’s. Ac-
cording‘ to McClelland, these flyers

They asked what the students felt
about the new visitation policy.
They turned to the president

president said, ‘I have ' no

“I should start by explaining why
I’m running for student govern-

government as it exists now has
slowly become an administrative
puppet. They often times reitterate
exactly what the adminstration
wants them to say. It is not ac-
curately representing what the
students want. The way SGB is set

“I’d like to work to create a new

type of student government. I’d like

. to have a president, and executive

board and two voting blocks. One
would be made up" ‘of elected
students, say two freshmen, two
sophomores, etcetera. . .and the
other I’d leave‘ open to the
organizations. These seats could be
proportional to the size of the
organization. This system, I
believe, adds much more student in-
put into student government and
will create more of a senseof in-
volvement.” Rice said.

ing toward the future,” Abraham

high credibility. I don’t want us to ., 
fluctuate back and forth from the .

radical to the conservative.

-“I want to get students involved,
and get them to be willing to take
the risk and commit themselves,
and not just listen to us and the ad-
ministrators say, ‘we’ll take care of
fit in time, we’ll work through the
channels,’ ” Bertocchi retorted. .

“I think by involving‘ more

students in student government, - .

we’ll have more unification among
the students. This way we’ll be able
to stand up against the administra-

tion and get something done instead . i"

of having them push us around. I

want to reverse these policies and I

this trend, and it may take all year "I 

to do this. I may be banging by

head against a wall but I think it’s ‘

Abraham defended the position
student government has taken’
under his direction this past year.

“This year student government

has ‘taken a different approach to .

things than it’ has taken in the past.
I think it’s been a good approach.

Evidence of this are such things as .

the university commitment to an

this proposal was in front of the ad- ' ‘

minstration; none of these worked.
We tried a different approach. We
sat down with the vice chancellor

Researchers Study Neighborhoods

By FRED BEERS
Pin News Staff Writer

The relationship between
neighborhood stability and ‘social
support networks is currently being
‘researched by Pitt's School of
Social Work in conjunction with
the Center of Social and Urban
Research.

The results of this project will
serve a twofold purpose according
to Roger Ahlbrant of the School of
Social Work who is serving as direc-
tor of the study.

“We’ll use the results to make
recommendations of policy on the
national level in respect to
strengthening neighborhoods and
improving social supports to
decrease mental health problems,”
Ahlbrandt said.

On the local level, the results will
be used to make recommendations
of policy on how “local govern-
ment could better utilize” resources
to upgrade social support networks.

He added that the collected data
will be distributed to
neighborhoods organizations ‘and

'that he was hopeful that there

would be a “wide dissemination of
the results.”

Social support networks, accor-
ding to Ahlbrandt, contain an “in-
dividual component as well as an in-
stitutional component.” They are
“those upon whom an individual
can rely on for emotional
problems." These include family,
friends, and neighbors as well as
community organizations.

The ultimate goal of this type of
project is to lessen life stress: that is
improve mental health, Ahlbrandt

said.

I The data now under analysis will
“explain attitudinal differences” as
they pertain to neighborhoods in
Pittsburgh, Ahlbrandt explained.

He added that it would also allow
the researchers to’ “relate dif-
ferences in the social support
systems of the neighborhoods to
neighborhood stability, mental
health, neighboring patterns, par-
ticipation, religious service and so
on‘)!

telephone interviews were con-
ducted, canvasing all
neighborhoods in Pittsburgh.

The interviews contained 128

questions pertaining to all aspects
of the neighborhood and covered

ning of the year and early spring.

Dec.l Deadline for Women's Center

By CHRIS CLINTON

Pin News Staff Writer

A December 1 deadline has
been posted by the provost’s office
for its final decision on the fate of
the Women’s Center according to
sources at the center.

In response, definite planning has 0

started by the center in its fight for
survival. This past Monday night,
various students, faculty and com-
munity members gathered at the
center to form a plan of action.

The community based center was
informed this summer that funding
by the university would be discon-
tinued after June 30, I981. The
university’s decision is based on the
predicted budget problems forseen
for fiscal year 1982. The center's
budget is currently less than $50,000
a year.

The Women’s Center has been in

existence since 1973. The services
offered include counseling, refer-
rals and support groups for women
facing problems with transitions in
their lives. Many of the programs
reach out to women returning to
school. Information concerning
health, law and finance are also
available. ’

The decision was made at the
meeting on Monday for the center
to ask for contributions from the
community, but only as a supple-
ment to university funding. Three
campaigns were‘ launched to
pressure the university into revers-
ing its decision.

The campaigns will focus on ob-
taining media attention, petition
signing and letter writing. These
“task forces” will be put into ac-
tion during the month of November
to prepare for the December first
decision.

A press release has been devised
to inform the media of the various
services offered and the problems
facing the center. This release will
be sent to television and radio sta-

tions and newspapers throughout "

the Pittsburgh area. The committee
is also seeking air time to present
their point of view.

The petition campaign will deal
with getting an undetermined
amount of signatures and presen-
ting them to the university adminis-
tration.

Individual protest will be the goal
behind the letter writing campaign.
The designated committee will try
to convince students, faculty and
staff members of the university to
write letters to the chancellor pro-
testing the closing. The
chancellor‘s office has already
received a large response from in-
dividuals.

CAS Council Decides to Approve SAS courses

By PEGGI FERRI
Pitt News Staff Writer

The College of Arts and Sciences
(CAS) Council decided at their
meeting Wednesday to accept the
responsibility of approving courses
offered in the Semester at Sea Pro-
gram and discussed the rules con-
cerning independent study credit.

At a previous meeting in Oct. , the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS)
Council moved it was “not their
role to approve or disapprove the
Semester at Sea Program” and
recognized "the responsibility of
CAS Council to consider courses
offered in the program for ap-
proval.”

“It’s funny that a faculty con-
cerned about usurpation of power
would vote to give the program
back to the university to approve,”
said Irwin Schulman, dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences.

“Most courses in the Program
are taken from existing course of-
ferings,” Schulman explained.
“There are only two or three new
ones that require the approval of
this body.” ‘-

Dr. Philip Stehle, professor of
physics, agreed and added, “It is
not the responsibility of this council
to consider courses in this program
for approval, but because we did
not ask for FAS Council to approve
them, we should consider them.”

However, Neal Galpern, pro-
fessor of history, maintained that
CAS Council had already done its
job.

“FAS Council didn’t approve it
or disapprove it and now it's back
to us. There is no reason for it to be
our responsibility to be dragged
along and have to approve it,”
Galpern said.

Schulman introduced the pro-

asked the council to consider what
rules should govern, among others,
the amount of credit awarded for
independent study.

“Very often, there is credit given
for less work done outside the
university than work done inside.

“It is not uncommon for students
to receive credit for non-learning
activities. For instance, students
doing menial lab work receive
credits, and athletic programs are a
unique category," Schulman ex-
plained.

“The situation I find-here is scan-
dalous. The department uses
credits instead of money as pay-
ment for this work. The student

pays money," but doesn’t learn.

of the Division of Infectious
Diseases,) attributed his success in
receiving the award to being well-
known, having a lot of experience
in the study of infectious diseases,
and being able to acquire the in-
terferon.

“The interferon will be supplied
through the Central Public Health
laboratories of Finland by virologist
Dr. Kari Cantell,” Ho said.

The three-year study will be con-
ducted at Pitt’s Graduate School of
Public Health (GSPH) and other
member institutions of the Univer-
sity Health Center of Pittsburgh.

The “placebo-controlled study”
will use outpatient facilities at
Mag_ee-Womens’ Hospital, the
clinical Research Unit at the School
of Medicine, and the GSPH
laboratories.

Subjects for thetresearch project
will be women who have had their
first episode of primary genital
herpes, and who have had the il-

lness for a short period of time.

Interferon has been widely ac-
claimed as a possible anti-viral and
anti-tumor agent. However, Ho
notesthat there have been relatively
few controlled clinical studies done
on the use of interferon and none

on its use in combatting genital
herpes.

According to Ho, the grant of
more than $355,000 will be broken
down and distributed yearly in ac-
cordance to the budget agreed upon
by The National Institutes of
Health and Ho’s research team.

The research team consists of
“three different components,” said
Ho: Dr. James H. Harger of
Magee-Womens Hospital, who will
be in charge of the virus clinic; Dr.
George J. Pazin of the Division of
Infectious Diseases at the School of
Medicine; Dr. John A. Armstrong
and Dr. Mary C. Breinig of the
GSPH.

The accomplishments of the
three-year study “will be to see if
interferon decreases the severity
and the number of occurances of
the disease,” Ho said.

The National Institutes of Health
functions as one of the main
governmental agencies which
ﬁnances. medical research. It is
broken up into seven departments.
The department that awarded Pitt
money for the research in genital
herpes was the National Institute

Environmental Epidemiology Center
Studies Disease in The Population

By WENDY WAREHAM

Along with the growing
awareness among the public that
man changes his environment
comes a realization that the en-
vironment also changes man. It is a
reciprocal effect that cannot be
altered. The Center for En-
vironmental Epidemiology (CEE)
at Pitt was formed to study the pro-
blems between the environment and
its effect on public health.

Epidemiology is the study of
disease in populations. Environ-
mental epidemiology is a special
field within epidemiology concern-
ed with the effects of the environ-
ment on people’s health. Accord-
ing to Dr. Edward Radford, direc-
tor of the CEE, this includes man-
made stubstances, naturally occur--
ring substances, as well as factors
like crowding.

The center was established in
September, ' 1979, after being
selected by the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency from 17 universities
that applied for the original grant.
Since 1979, six other centers have
been established. But Pitt’s center
is the only one in the country that
researches human health effects and
advises the EPA on their findings.

Radford said the center research-

es problems that are of a specific
interest to the EPA, but-that is not
their only function.

“They (EPA) look to us for ad-
vice on specfic problems. Some-
times they have us review some of
their internal documents for our
opinion as to how reliable the
results may be,” he said.

“Although our center is based on
EPA funds, it isn’t restricted to
that. We’re seeking possible fund-
ding from other agencies of the
government, or from industry, or
foreign governments,” Radford ex-
plained.

“We’re exploring international
implications of these environmental
problems. We’ve done a project for
the Bahamas government. We’re
going to help them organize a study
on certain chemicals emitted from
some industries there,” he said.

The center is currently research-
ing a number of projects. One of
the more well publicized projects is
the study of exposure to low-level
radiation in the Cannonsburg area"
of Pennsylvania.

‘.i‘There was ’a plant there that
processed radium from around the
turn of the century until just before
World War II,’’ Radford explain-
ed. “It was one of the early plants
in the United States that extracted

uiamum from radium ores for com-
mercial purposes.

“They would extract the radium .

and leave the tailings (radioactive
material left over) lying around. It's
been sitting there for decades. It
was never buried. It just sort of sat
there in piles," he said.

disease rates in coal miners. What
he found was that the number of
stomach cancers were higher than
would be expected for that popula-
tion according to age, race, sex,
ethnic background, and so on. So
that gives us a clue that there's
something involved in coal mining.
“Additional evidence is that the
stomach cancer rate has been com-
ing down very drastically. It's been
a very remarkable phenomenon.

“Eventually it was hauled away a ~ 

and used to fill in a lagoon to make
a children’s playing field. Some of
it was hauled away and used as a
soil conditioner. Even
citizens would haul it away in
wheelbarrows and put it on their
gardens,” he said.

The center received a grant of
$500,000 this year to study the im-
pact of this low-level radiation ex-
posure on the people who live in
Cannonsburg. Radford hopes that
information discovered there_will be
helpful in evaluating possible health
effects on workers involved with
radioactive substances and other
comparable types of exposure.

Another research project the
center is working on involves a
possible connection between coal
products (manufacturing, mining,
waste or transport) and stomach
cancer.

“We have some indications that
there is a correlation between the
use of coal and the development of
stomach cancer,” Radford said.
“We don’t know what the link is
yet, or even how strong the link is.
But we are carrying out a research
project. This is a good area to do
that kind of research because so
much coal is used here.”

Radford explained how the
center investigates a possible health
problem: ’

V “Let’s take the caes of the coal
connection, if I may call it that,” he
said; “A study was done by one of
our faculty members looking at

so, but it also parallels the decline in
the use of coal,” he said.
‘‘It’s not very strong evidence,

‘ but it’s suggestive. In other words,

we switched from coal to oil and
natural gas just about the time the
rate of stomach cancer began to
come down.

“The interest of the EPA is, if
there is anything to this hypothesis
and we're now going back to coal in
a big way, are we going to have a
big stomach cancer ' problem re-
emerging? It's possible,” Radford
asserted.

Radford said these health fac-
tors, while being a cause for con-
cern, should not be the basis on
which decisions are made concern-
ing the future of energy sources.

ed ten years from now, rather than

Tibbets’ Art: Delving Into The Inner Structure

ROGER TIBBETTS
PAINTINGS

UP Callery

October 14-November 9

By MYRLE KAYE

Without a skeleton, the
human body becomes a soft
sack of skin, a huge jellyfish.
Bones provide a stable founda-
tion for muscles, dictating form
and movement. Skeletons
fascinate with their’ slender
strength, their veiled presence in
all of us.

Roger Tibbetts' show of
paintings and drawings opened
at the UP Gallery October 14.
He deals with a different kind of
skeleton in his work—linear
geometric figures. Tibbetts
strips his vision down to a
primary focus of circles and
elipses, squares and retangles.
Limiting his color range to
black, red, and blue for large

areas, he creates a stability.

The intimacy of the UP
Gallery serves Tibbetts' pieces
well. Entering the quiet rooms
from Forbes Avenue, the viewer
finds one wall ~ completely
devoted to a three-panel red
composition. The strong,
primary red fields the thin, exact
black lines of elipses. Tibbetts
plays with the panels, continu-
ing some lines from one to the
other, allowing ‘other lines to
abruptly stop.

In the gallery's second room,
a black wall-length rectangle
dominates the area. The lines
working in the black space are
delicate and provide surprising
bursts of blue, yellow, white,
and red. Two folded elipses, red
and black, jut from the opposite
wall and counter the solid rect-
angle. Elipses appear in each of
the paintings—skeletons of
form.

The show gives ample room

 

Roger Tibbets’ works:

to six of Tibbetts’ diagrammed
drawings. The dog—eared works,
embellished with staple marks,
erasures, and even a coffee
stain, pulse with an energy that
belies the placidity of the paint-
ings. The drawings don't focus

on certain lines—their space
brims with a variety of intersect-
ing and non-intersecting
geometric forms. The drawings
tell a history of the paintings,
describing their evolutionary
process.

Tibbetts is a visiting artist at
Carnegie-Mellon University. His
show runs through November 9,
and fits well into the month of
October with its frost-covered
evenings, crayoned leaves, and
early darkness.

THE NUMA BAND
The Numa Band
Ovation Records

The Numa Band is one of
those nice, unoffensive jazz
bands that finds itself at peace
with the world immersed in the
mainstream of jazz circles. It is
light, tuneful, and relatively
mindless.

At times highly flavorful, this
album is the perfect low—key
medium for various activities:
intimate little vegetable parties,
calculus homework, or a junior
high school intensity of innocent
lovemaking.

Straight from the depths of
ethnic Chicago, the Numa Band,
like many of its predecessors,
both successful and otherwise, is
typical of the new kids on the
block trying to break into the
business with all the con-
glomerated talent they can
possibly muster. In this case, the
talent is there.

This is especially evident in
Russ lverson's saxophone.
Though he promises no break-
outs into the stylized sax-
jamming escapades one might
expect on a jazz album, he pun-
ches out a lulling melody that
will soothe rather that entice.
Sort of an audio quaalude.

New Wave is really one of the
most stupid terms ever foisted
on pop music. Any term that
has the pretensions to covering
bands as divergent as The Sex
Pistols, The Pretenders, or The
Specials obviously isn't worth
much.

At any rate, The Police are
another sort of "New Wave"
band. That is, a group of vet
musicians who read the trends
and made the jump. Unlike
some hacks who have tried this,

they have class.

The music is essentially a
futhering of their last album
Regatta De Blanc. No surprises
there. What's interesting is that

‘some new lyrical inspiration has
come into the fold.

On their last tour, the band
went to places bands hardly ever
go. Places like India and
Thailand. This has yielded cuts
like the fatalistic "When The
World Is Running Down, You
Make The Best Of What's Still

Around." Or there's "Bomb's
Away," more tongue-in-cheek
humor from Stewart Copeland.
Only a more relevant edge has
slipped in.

So far, these guys have
developed a reputation as hot
players. With a little luck, no
one will bother putting them in
any categories.

Third is the best.

  Going Beyond  
the Surface

Next week a team of evaluators from the Middle
States Association will visit Pitt to conduct a four-
day study of the university and its effectiveness.

If the evaluators find serious deficiencies in
specific areas, Pitt will be asked to correct the pro-
blems. Failure to respond to Middle States sugges-
tions could jeopardize continuation of Pitt’s ac-
creditation.

There are, in our eyes, some serious curricular
deficiencies here at Pitt. Deficiencies exist in require-
ments and course structures that result in Pitt

students receiving a less than adequate education.
Although we recognize some of Pitt’s finer pro-
grams—Medicine, Health Related Professions and
Engineering—we believe that there are some areas,
particularly in the College of Arts and Sciences that
need a careful evaluation.

We do not condone the attitude of Associate Pro-
vost Robert Nossen who said that formal accredita-
tion is a secondary concern in the process, because
continuing accreditation is relatively assured. ’

It seems that Nossen has taken the accreditation
proves for granted, and has failed to put any‘
credence in the possible suggestions or deficiencies
that the team might find. .

We urge Nossen and other members of the
administration to take the accreditation process
seriously and heedlthe warnings that may be issued
therein. "

We understand why some persons may believe that

Pitt can be car_ried through almost any evaluation on 3,.

its mere reputation, but such is not the case.

As we stated before, there are severe curricular and
staffing problems to be dealt with Here at the univer-
sity that have gone unattended for some time.

On Nov. 12, the accreditation team chairman John
Toll, who is also president of the University of Mary-
land will put the finishing touches on the team’s final
report and then present it to Pitt Chancellor Wesley
Posvar. _ I

For our sake we hope that the team finds no pro-
blems that cause Pitt to lose its accreditation. It is

Greeks Saving Seats at Football Game Irks Pitt Students

To the Editor:

For four years I have attended all
of the Pitt home football games,
and for four years I have been told
the same thing by the fraternities
and sororities that “these seats are
saved.” The fraternities and
sororities are not just saving seats,
but also rows and sections, roping
them off, creating a dangerous
situation for movement in the

‘ V bleachers. '

Every Saturday morning my
friends and I, as a group,_ go up to
the stadium 2 hours prior to the
start of the game in order to obtain
enough seats for us as close to the
50-yard line as possible. We enter
Gate 8 and see many rows of empty
seats, but as we attempt to sit down’,
we are approached by someone
from the fraternities or sororites
telling us “these seats are saved.”

One specific example of this oc-
curred at the Pitt homecoming
game on October 18. When we
entered the stadium at 11:30 a.m.,

we found a large section of unoc-
cupied rows (at least 20). After we
sat down, we were approached by a
tall “cowboy’-’ from a fraternity.
“These seats are saved” he told us.
Therefore, we sat down in the row
behind the so—called “reserved
seats” in the_ student section and a
few of us sat down in the row above
where 3 girls were sitting. After a
few minutes, one girl turned to me
and said, “these seats are saved.”

After being kicked out for the se-
cond time, our tempers began to
rise. We managed to obtain 3 seats
from the “cowboy” after a near
keg rolling contest in the bleachers
instead of around the track, for we
claimed that he didn't need all of
those seats. After the dispute for
these 3 seats, a girl came over and
said she needed 1 more row for her
sorority. The “cowboy," without a
moment of hesitation, automatical-
ly surrendered one whole row prov-
ing my point that 20 rows were not
needed. The “cowboy’s” explana-

Policy

tion for saving so many rows was
that he was expecting many alumni
for this game and that they‘usually
sit in the other section, even closer
to the 50-yard line, except these
seats were already saved by another
fraternity. Granted, they have a
large group, but we don't like s -
ting ‘in the end zone anymore than
they do. _

What makes the fraternities and
sororities better than the other
students that they can save all these
seats? After all, it is the student
section and no one owns any seats,
let alone rows. Fraternities and
sororities should not have the

privileges of this monopoly just
because they are university spon-
sored groups. I can understand
their wanting to sit together as a
group, because I like to sit withmy
friends too. If they want to sit
together as a group, then they
should come together as a group.
Sure, I save seats, but only or two at
the'most, not rows; or my friends
and I squeeze together to make
room. Steps ,toward consideration
should be taken concerning the

number of seats being saved. One

person should not save 20 rows of
seats. The fraternities and
sororities didn't pay any more for

these seats than the rest of us and_

we are entitled to sit in these seats
just as much as they are.

Whatever happened to “first
come, first serve?” My group of
friends and I are there before their

groups start coming in., and we are V
going to continue sitting in any '.

unoccupied seat or row, because we
are tired of cooperating and trying

Prof and Librarians Clarify Students’
Complaints About -Chemistry Library

(Editor’s note: this letter was writ-
ten to Joe Schoenholte’s letter
published in the Nov. 5 edition of
The Pitt News).

To the Editor: . I

Since Mr. Schoenholte’s com-
plaint about the Chemistry
Library’s policy is by no means the
first one we have received on this
topic, we would like to take this
opportunity to clearly describe our
current policy.

Students who are enrolled in the
introductory organic chemistry
laboratory courses (Chem 33, 34)
are assigned‘ problems to analyze
unknown compounds. One techni-
que they use is spectral analysis.
Once they are given or have
themselves produced a spectral
curve of their unknown, their
assignment is to interpret that spec-

’ tral curve using the theoretical pl'|l‘|-

ciples they have learned in class. In
other words, it is the student's abili-
ty to analyze experimental data bas-
ed upon his theoretical knowledge
that is being tested.

For this pedigogical reason it has
been policy in this course that the
student should not use published
reference spectra. The students are
expected to obtain their own spectra
and interpret them independently.

‘Therefore, collections such as the

“Sadtler Spectral File” and the
Aldrich Library are not made
available to students in Chem 33
and 34. We emphasize that this
restriction applies only to these two
courses.

It is quite possible that Mr.
Schoenholte’s laboratory instructor
recommended that he confirm his
interpretation in this case; but if so,

it was a failure on the part of the ,

laboratory instructor to follow ex-
isting policy. We can understand
how this can happen because there
_is a considerable
laboratory instructors each year.
We emphasize that the reason for
this policy is based upon what we
believe is best for the students’
educational experience.

We can understand how Mr.
Schoenholte could easily become in-
censed if this policy were not made
clear to him and we welcome the
opportunity to make it explicit to all
of the Chemistry Library users.

The Pantherette volleyball team
lost to Penn State Tuesday night,
two games to three. Despite the
loss, head coach Shelton Collier
was pleased with the quality of his
team’s play.

“Actually I think we played real
well,” Collier said. “I think my
first reaction after the match was
that I was happy, and I think the
girls were happy because they felt
they were starting to play well
again.

Pitt News Sports Editor I

Most Pitt fans will probably hang
around the stadium tomorrow until
at least halftime to see Hugh
Green’s number retired, because
there looks to be little action on the
field when the Panthers take on
Louisville.

The Cardinals are a 3-5 team
which hasn’t really been impressive
in any of its wins. Louisville

‘ defeated Kansas (17-9), Memphis

State (38-14) and Indiana State
(27-17). The Cards lost to three
good teams in Florida State (52-0),
Miami of Florida (24-10) and
Florida (13-0). They were also
defeated by Murray State (13-9) and
Temple (17-12).

“Louisville is a team that has
some talent, probably more than a
couple teams we played earlier,”
said Pitt coach Jackie Sherrill. “I’m
sure they’ll show up and play well.
They certainly have some players
who can run.”

The Cardinals are led by tailback
Don Craft who has rushed for 538
yards and four touchdowns on 103
carries. He gained 127 yards on 10
carries against Temple last week.

The Louisville quarterback, Pat

Patterson, has. hit on 58 of 142
two
touchdowns. '

As for Pitt. the Panthers will
once again be led by quarterback
Rick Trocano.‘ He has completed
50 of 84 passes for five touchdowns
and 743 yards. Trocano has passed

games where we were playing some
real good volleyball,” Collier said.
“I think now we’re looking ahead
to regionals with a greater amount
of confidence.”

One indication of the upswing in
the team’s efforts was the perfor-
mance of Linda Stadler, star spiker,
against the highly rated Ellen Kran-
dal of Penn‘State.

“Linda Stadler out-played Ellen
Krandal, which was encouraging
for us,” Collier said. “She was
much more efficient at the net.”

Ultimately, it was blocking that
did in the Pantherettes. As a result
blocking is being concentrated on in
practice.

“I’d have to say the main reason

Dave Havern and moved into se-
cond place on Pitt’s list of all-time
total offense leaders with 4,163
yards. He trails only Tony Dorsett
whose career total yardage stands at
6,256 yards. Trocano will be one of
21 seniors playing their last game at
Pitt Stadium Saturday.

Sherrill will be saying goodbye to
his first recruiting class when these
seniors graduate.

Hugh Green is another who will
be saying goodbye to Pitt Stadium
tomorrow. ’

“Pitt Stadium has been a part of
the four greatest years in my life, so
you bet I've got a lot of memories,”
said all-America Hugh Green. “I
just might stay on the field after the
game a little and watch the fans
leave. . . just to savor the moment a
little.’’ I

“When they graduate, these
seniors can say they’ve kept a foot-
ball program on top,” he said.
“There’s no doubt that Saturday’s
game should be a rewarding time
for them. And there's no question
they’ll have had one of the best
records of any class ever at the
University of Pittsburgh.”

Back to the subject at
hand—Louisville——Sherrill is confi-
dent that his team won’t let down
and will win its 15th game in a row
at Pitt Stadium.

“This is a very mature, intelligent
football team and they know what
the stakes are,” said Sherrill.

we didn't play as well as we could
have is because of our blocking,
which was not that good,” Collier
said. “We didn’t use our new
strategy, but returned to our old of-
fense, with Maria Perez in the set-
ting position.

“There’s a give and take,” he ad-
ded. “Maria is a better setter; she's
one of the best around. And Julie
Gaul is just learning so it's kind of a
trade off. We can have a good of-
fense and lack the height with
Maria in there or we can sacrifice
some of the setting and put in a
taller person. Those are the deci-
sions we are making right now.”

This weekend, the Pantherettes
will go to Michigan in their last

 

competition before the regional
championships on November 20th.
Out of a field of eight teams, Pitt is
scheduled to face Wisconsin, Ten-
nessee, the top ranked team in the
south, and Kellogg Community
College, the defending national
champion in the junior college divi-
sion.

Collier is expecting all of the
competition to be tough, “a notch
above Penn State and Rutgers,”
but feels that the toughest matches
will come against Tennessee.

“This is our last match before the
regionals,” Collier said. “I think
we’ve been improving all year, as a
team we’ve been coming together,
but there's still some things that

Panlhereh‘es’Spikers Defeated By Penn State  

need to be improved.”
In practices, Collier has been try-
ing to get his players to improve

their blocking skills by anticipating‘

the spikes. Since the whole squa
rotates with each new possession of
the ball, everyone has to develop
good all aroun‘d skills, but general-
ly, Collier believes, things are com-
ing together well.

“We had a strong start at the
beginning of the season,” he said,
“and the last couple of weeks have
been critical, but the team took it
upon themselves to regroup and get
themselves together.

“Right now, I think we’re just
right,” Collier added. “We’re
ready for the regionals.” 4

Those “good things” could turn

for sure until bids are actually ex-
tended.

receivers, Willie Collier, Benjie

caught at least one pass in seven of
the first eight games of the year.
Collins has had at least one recep-

Pitt is ranked ninth in the AP poll
and eighth in the UPI rankings. . .
Pitt hasn't lost a home game since
the 1977 loss to Penn State. . .
Pitt’s defense is still ranked number
one against the rush allowing an
average of 58.9 yards per game, tied
for number one (with Virginia
Tech) in total defense (205 yards per
game), and eighth against the score 5]
(10.2 points per game). . .The Pan-
ther offense is also ranked. The
passing game is number five (267.7
yards per game) and Pitt is number
14 in scoring with an average of
30.4 yards per game. .

     

Fullback Randy McMillan is now averaging 4.7 yards per carry this season. lie hopes to see holes like this in the

HughGreen Will Say Farewell to Pitt Fans

By SAUL MARKOWITZ
Pin News Sports writer

This Saturday Hugh Green, Pitt's
awesome defensive end, will be
playing his final game in front of
the Panther partisans.

Though the option was open for
him to play at Mississippi State,
Green decided to change his mind
and come to Pitt. There were a few
reasons for this major change.

“The people, the idea that I got a
chance to play in my first year and
the opportunity to be at a big
university and have that national
Exposure.”

Once entering Pitt he soon
became a well known celebrity. His
hard hitting and ability to always be
at the right spot at the right time
were well appreciated by the fans.

Green set a few goals when star-
ting his career here.

“To make all-American, to be
the best defensive end in the coun-
try and to go to 4 consecutive bowl
games.” he stated. All of these

goals have the potential to be
achieved and he is proud of his ac-
complishments.

After graduation Green hopes to
play pro football. When asked what
team he wishes to play for, he com-
mented “it’s not my decision,” and
added that no teams have yet ap-
proached him.

What alternative career is he
seeking?

“I want to get involved with
business, a restaurant or something
like that,” said Green, “so I can
fall upon it in case something hap-
pens to me.” 4 ,

Green attributes his success main-
ly to the fans.

“The past 4 years I’ve really ap-
preciated what they’ve given me
and I’m going to miss them and I
love them.”

He commented that it is truly a
thrill for him to hear the fans yell
his name after he makes a play.
Green feels that he owes the fans
everything in the world.

Another reason for his success
these past years has been “hard
work, people behind me pushing me
trying to make me no.1.”

According to Green, since he
began playing football, has always
wanted to be the best defensive
player. Many sports writers feel he
has accomplished his dream. This
can be shown by being chosen to be
on the cover of the college football
preview issue of Sports Illustrated.

Does he mind all this publicity or
does being pestered by reporters
sometimes bother him? ‘‘It helps,”
said Green. You always have to
cope with it and always be yourself.
I think the past 4 years I’ve been
myself and I haven't been cocky."

Hugh Green has also been
honored by being selected as a can-
didate for the famed Heisman
Trophy which is presented to the
best college player.

“I’m honored! 1’-m glad the peo-
ple are putting me up on that type
of stage to say that I'm classified as
good enough to be among the
leaders for the trophy like the
Heisman.”

Green will be doing a lot of runn-
ing and just basicly working on
himself to get ready for the pros.
What he really want to do is “try to
erase some of the things that are my
weaknesses.’ ’

Since being at Pitt Green feels he
has not only matured physically,
but academically as well.

Now that Hugh Green is leaving,
an era in Pitt football is ending. It’s
difficult to think of attending a
game without the familiar state-
ment: “tackle by no. 99
Huuuuuugh Green!” He has truly
been a big asset not only to his
team, but to the school as a whole.
