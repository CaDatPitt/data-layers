Morrison vvins SGBpreidency

.by Lindsay Carroll
Senior Staff W//‘iter

Pitt students elected Kevin Morri-
son to be their next Student Govern-
ment Board president by a  of
fewer than 100 votes yesterday.

Mortison’s board will consist of
Lance Bonner, Andrew Freeman, Nila
Devanath, Ada Noh, Charlie Shull, Al-
exajennings, Max Greenwald and Kat-
lyn  current SGB president
Sumter Link announced last night

Morrison, the current SGB alloca-
tions chair, beat Justin Romeo of the
Integrity slate by 86 votes Current
board member Amanda Reed ﬁnished
third in the presidential race and Dan
Gore ﬁnished fourth.

“I think I just had so many people
behind me who believed in me,” said
Morrison. “Each of [the candidates]
had something unique that deﬁned
them ...AndIrespect them.”

About 4,000 students voted in the
election, an increase from last year.

All the totals separating the board
member candidates were close. Bon-
ner won the most votes, with Freeman
and current board member Devanath
 close behind

Link announced the results to a
room packed with candidates, current
and former board members and their
ftiends.

“Why can’t we have this much at-
tendance at a board meeting?” said cur-

When Link said Morrison won,
half of the room stood up and
cheered

“I have full conﬁdence in Kevin’s
ability to be president,” said Link. “It’s
a very diverse boar ”

Romeo said he felt he did well de-
spite his close second—place ﬁnish

‘Tm very proud of my slate,” said
Romeo. “I believe thatI had the best
platform”

Reed said she was happy with the
election despite her loss

“If that’s what the students wanted,
then that’s how it should be,” she said
“I think for me personally, it gives me
the chance to focus on other 
that I really care about _

“IthinkKevincandoagoodjob.
I think that board is amazing,” she
added. “It’s a well—rounded group of

Gore said he appreciated those
who voted for him.

“Iwould like to thank all of the
905 supporters of my candidacy who
voted to revolutionize this campus,”
said Gore. “However, I am saddened
for the University because today it lost

People running out of gas, bio-fuels

by Jayson Myers
' Slqﬂ Wrder .

People are quickly running out
of natural gas. But one environmen-
tal expert said that bio’-fuels aren’t
the solution. ~

Pat Atkins, CEO of sustain-
ability consulting ﬁrm Atkins 360,
said he believes that bio—fuels, fuels
produced from natural sources and
refined into substances like ethanol,
won’t provide a suitable replacement

in the long term.

People will burn through two-
thirds of all available petroleum by
2040 if they continue at their cur-
rent consumption rates, said Atkins
in a lecture in Posvar Hall last night.

Atkins said that in 1859 the world
had access to three trillion barrels of
natural gas, and people have since

-used one trillion of those barrels

and will have used another trillion
by 2040.

The majority of the remaining
natural gas, Atkins added,‘will be in
- forms that will be difﬁcult to reﬁne,
such as oil shale, a form of sedi-
mentary" rock from which people
can obtain the materials needed to
produce oil. '

_ “We are living in interesting
times,” said Atkins, referring to a
unique convergence of fuel and
food problems.

Ethanol production depends on

crops like corn and sugar cane. This
dependence, said Atkins, raises the
price of food. '

“Food costs rose signiﬁcantly in

2008 and remain high,” he said.

Atkins said that in July of this

7 year, the price of corn hit a record

high, despite production twice its
normal rate.

Atkins didn’t provide" a single
deﬁnite solution to the problem dur-
ing his lecture. ~

not a fix

He said that people worldwide
need to either reduce or eliminate
their dependence on liquid fuel. Un-
til they do so, he said, they must bal-
ance their natural gas consumption
while working to ﬁnd alternative fuel
sources that would more effectively
sustain human consumption than
ethanol would. ' ’

At the moment, Atkins said, A

he wasn’t sure what those sources
would be.

British musician Joel Lindsey started Best in
the Burgh last March at Connections Cafe in
Oakland. Since then, the $5 charity event has
grown to highlight some of the best artists in
the Pittsburgh region ’ .

The events are known for placing an empha-

and prizes given away duting the show, with all
the proceeds going to Lupus Pennsylvania

“I guess the best way of  to get media
attention is to get all the best musicians in one
place and have a stage for all the best and try and
promote that itself,” said Lindsey. “It became
extremely popular, and the public has really sup-
ported us.” , e . 1

‘‘It’s always neat to be on the same lineup

Jason Kendall, a local musician who  per-_

way to try and mix up what you’re going to hear

whenever you hear Best in the Burgh.”_

to the popular Cabaret Theatre on Penn Ave. in

Girl Talk

With Grand Buffet, CX Kidtronik and Skymall
Saturday, 8 p.m.
Club Gravity, Cheswick
Sold Out

Gregg Gillis sits on his couch, funously tap-
ping away on his laptop. It’s time to go to work.

The blinds are drawn in the front room of
his quaint, barely furnished home in Pittsburgh’s
Polish Hill neighborhood, casting a soft red glow
on the computer screen that bounces up to his
quickly scanning eyes.

He wears an old flarmel shirt, faded Chicago

Bulls gym shorts and slippers. Thisis about as’

dressed up as he’ll ever get for work.

He opens a folder on his computer full of
hundreds of nondescript ﬁles. Each one is a
speck of what will eventually become music —
a single snare drum hit, a low bass tone.

Gillis clicks and drags a half dozen out of -

the folder.

“Here’s a heavy bass tone  we’ll use this one
and distort it,” said Gillis.

His words can barely keep up with his copy-

ing, pasting, listening, cutting and tweaking. He’s

obsessive about details and adjusts every level,
every tone. In about 10 minutes, he has. built a
four—second beat from "scratch. ‘

Ladies and gentlemen, meet Girl Talk. _

Equal parts pop music junkie, mad scientist
and producer, Gillis, who creates music under
the alias Girl Talk, has devoted the last half-de-
cade of his life to perfecting the art of the mash-
up.i Mash—up refers to music that is created solely
from: digital samples taken from other songs,
spliced into a neon patchwork quilt of recogniz-
able beats, vocal tracks and melodies.

For Gillis, though, the mash-up isn’t simply
pairing one song to another. Girl Talk music, he
said, is ttansformative. By using only brief hints

of each song swirled together, his work is more
like a Jackson Pollock painting —— snippets of
hundreds of songs pieced together in one fran-
tic, rambunctious whole.

“There are maybe 10 samples at once, but
you can only make out two,” said Gillis.

Last sumrner’s Feed Me Animalr, Girl Talk’s
fourth and best album, featured more than
300 samples edited seamlessly together. into

I one mind-blowing mash-up, separated into 14

tracks. Gillis even considered releasing multiple
editions, each starting at a different place of the
work —,— the album has no true end, no real be-
ginning. Play it on repeat and it’ll loop endlessly.

Also showing up are Girl Talk’s fans — tons

of them, and every one ready to party. Girl Talk H

shows feature Gillis alone with his laptop, mix-
ing his samples liveiin the center of audience
rave—ups that verge on dance—euphoria. Proud
fans climb onstage and bounce around Gillis as
he taps away at the keyboard.

“The audience onstage — that’s my laser

light show. That’s my pyrotechnics,” said Gillis.

\Within' minutes of the first beat of any show,
Gregg Gillis becomes the sweaty, nearly naked
eye of a feverous, pulsating danceiparty hurri-
cane. Just try not to spill your beer on the com-
puter. V . -

Gillis grew up in Pittsburgh’s South Hills.
He was a lad who, after attending Lollapalooza
in 1995, constantly searched for “what the ex-

tent of weird music was.” In high school, his_

right), was more interested in syncing skipping
CD players and four—tIacks than  teen
love ballads.

“We had goals of making everyone hate us,”
said Gillis.

But as Girl Talk, the moniker he adopted
while studying biomedical engineering at Cleve— I
land’s Case Western Reserve, Gillis embraced
his love of unabashed, superﬁcial pop music —-—
you know, the stuff that hits are made of.

“In the underground, you need that critical
push for people to like you. In that way, main-
stream pop artists are more about what the fans
want than any other type of music,” said Gil-
lis. “I wanted to ﬂip [my high school attitude]
and make really populist music for everyone to
like.”

Gillis release two records of crude, frenetic
mash-ups to the electronic music underground

while working as an engineer, and, in 2006, Gillis
dropped Nzg/92‘ Rq">per.

Girl Talk had created the ultimate party
soundtrack — all the catchy choruses and hot
beats, none of the filler.

But soon came grumblings about the law
—- Gillis hasn’t obtained, oreven attempted to
obtain, legal clearance for any of the hundreds
of samples on his records. Could he get sued?
The simple answer is, well, nobody knows. Gillis
maintains that he’s safe under the fair use doc-
trine of U.S. copyright law, which protects a new
work if it doesn’t damage the proﬁtability of the
original. So far, Gillis has stayed out of court;
There’s simply too much to lose for the sampled
artists, Gillis said. ‘

“I can’t imagine that the people suing me
wouldn’t look like the bad guys. Everyone knows
the Lars story.- Metallica lost a lot of street cred af-
ter that one,” he said, citing Metallica’s drummer’s

  
 
 
 

2001 legal battle with downloading giant Napster.

\With Feed z‘/ye Animalr, Gillis has come to
terms with his now tired Sample Renegade per-
sona (he even samples Metallica’s “One”).

“If you interview everyone who walks in
and out of Club Gravity, no one is there for the
controversy They’re there for the music,” said
Gillis. _ ,

And with good reason — the sound collage
of Reed I/ye /lmimalr is arguably the most compre-
hensive collection of pop music ever. And it’s all
there on one album.

No wonder, then, that the album took Gil-
lis more than two years to complete. He often
worked eight to 10 hours a day perfecting only a
few seconds of music

.\While the actual sample assembly of the
record was compiled and ﬁnished from home,
Gillis used live ‘shows to generate ideas and
crowd—test which pairings worked the best.

“It was such a massive mountain to climb,

because the more time I put into it, the more

options [for new samples] I ha ” said Gillis. “I
could’ve spent 10 years — a lifetime —— on the
record. It’s never truly complete. The day I ﬁn-
ished Feed 2799 Animalrl took the day off, but the
next day I had new samples beyond the record

Gillis cracked a  acknowledging the
daunting task that he completed just last June,
when Feed 2‘/Je Aizimalr was released — as a pay-

“I’m so happy I’m done.”

Gregg Gillis watches the Steelers every
weekend. He frequents his favorite local dive,
Gooski’s, for a drink on his nights off. And he

shops at Giant Eagle every week, where, he said,

people never recognize him.
But with his laptop, he throws the wildest
parties in the world. And everyone’s invited.

For the first time in its brief history,
the River City Rivalry means something.

The Pitt football team enters tomor-
row’s contest against Cincinnati with a
possible Big East title and a BCS bowl bid

are the likely candidates for the Orange

With Big East tourney approaching, Pitt looks for payback

_ by Randy Lieberman
Staff Writer"

It isn’t March, but tournament‘

time hits Pitt’s campus with the
kickoff of the 2008 Big East Vol-

leyball Championship today at,

the Fitzgerald Field House.

The Pitt 'women’s volleyball
team faces ﬁrst-round opponent
Cincinnati at 6 p.m. Pitt dropped
its only match against the Bearcats
this season 3-0.

Games begin at 10 a.m., with
No. 4-seeded Connecticut taking
on the No. 5 seed, Notre Dame.

The Panthers (16-13, 8-6 Big
East) are the seventh seed in the
tournament and are coming off
one of their best performances
of the year inja 3-0 win at Mar-
quette last weekend.

“Everything just came — to-

gether,” said sophomore outside ‘

hitter Amy Town. “All year, we’ve
had one or two players play re-
ally well, but against Marquette,
everyone played ’ their position
well.” V V

Pitt coach Toby Rens repeated

‘ Town’s praise for the Panthers.

“I feel like it was one of the
matches where we all clicked at
the same time,” said Rens.

Pitt traveled a long road to get
to that point against the Golden
Eagles, including a coaching
change just prior to the start of
the season and adjusting to a new
playing style throughout the cam-
Wign-

‘‘Looking back, we deﬁnitely
made some great gains,” said
Rens. “I’m just really happy with
the work ethic of this group and
their attitude. They showed a

lot of character through adver- '

sity and I’m really happy with
the progress they’ve made as a
group.”

The Panthers’ progress from
last year to this year included a

berth in the Big East tournament, _

something senior middle hitter

Jessica Moses was determined to ‘ '

achieve this year.

“It was a iheartbreaker last
year,” said Moses about missing
the Big East tournament last sea-
son. “This year,‘ with our team,

nothing has happened to make us
lose focus on the Big East tour-
nament. It’s awesome to be back,
especially in my senior year.”
Moses said Pitt’s season began

at

last spring while the entire team
played spring volleyball matches.
She added that the team built up
chemistry and camaraderie dur-
ing the games, which has helped
carry the players through the off-
season and regular season.

More importantly, the games

established the seniors as leaders '

of the team.
“Being around the seniors,
with their mindset and their ex-

perience, has really helped me

focus,” said Town. “Being on
the court with them every single
game this year, I can see how
much they want it.” ' .

.“-I think they have the most

, said Rens of the seniors. “They

As for Pitt’s next opponent,
the Bearcats were 25-5 on the year
and ﬁnished their season tied for
first in the Big East standings.

Cincinnati is also the hot-
test team coming into the Big“)
East tournament, having won
15 matches in a row. Its last loss
came against No. 4-seeded" Con-
necticut almost two months ago,
on Sept. 28. .

In its only match of the sea-

Pitt to face spread offense
with dangerous receivers

H Football, page 10

West Virginia and’ Connecticut, Pitt will
be the Big East representative in a BCS
game.

The Panthers _own a 7-0 advantage

lifetime against Cincinnati, but Pitt coach

Dave Wannstedt isn’t thinking about that
statistic. 1

“We will not be overconﬁdent going
into this game,” said Wannstedt at his
weekly press conference. “This is a vet-
eran team that won a lot of games. Our
team knows the challenge that we have.”

The Bearcats ride a three-game win-
ning streak into tomorrow night’s battle.

. Quarterback Tony Pike, who was injured

in the fourth quarter of last week’s win
over Louisville, is expected to start.

Cincinnati has played ﬁve quarterbacks
this season ‘because of an injury plague.
Opening day starter Dustin Grutza broke
his leg against Oklahoma in the second
game of the season, and Pike filled in ad-
mirably. He has 1,479 passing yards and
12 touchdowns on the year.

The Bearcats boast two dangerous
threats at wide receiver. Senior Dominick

412"‘688"f85383

Goodman and junior Marshwan Gilyard
havecombined for 111 catches and 1,560
yards, to go along with 14 touchdowns.

‘ “Goodman is a big, strong and physical
player with great hands,” said Wannstedt.
“[Gilyard’s] probably the most dangerous
guy we’ll face once he has the ball in his
hands.”

Pitt running back LeSean McCoy looks
to bounce back from the worst statistical
performance of his young career. McCoy
ran for 39 yards on 17 carries in Pitt’s 41-7
triumph over Louisville Nov. 8.

‘Despite the rough game, McCoy still
has 1,043 yards and 16 touchdowns on
the season. j

The Panthers defense might have a
tall task ahead as well. Cincinnati runs a
spread offensethat has garnered 374.9
yards per game. In addition to the pass-
ing threat, Cincinnati owns two tailbacks
with more than 400 rushing yards: Jacob
Ramsey and John Goebel.

“You prepare for everything, and at

'this point in the season we’Ve seen every-

thing,” said Wannstedt.

Men's Basketball

With Fields healthy, Pitt

by Ben Duignan
Staﬁ’ Writer

When the preseason rankings came out, it
was almost _a consensusthat in order for the
Pitt basketball team to hold its spot as a legiti-
mate title contender, Levance Fields was going
to need to be healthy. V

After Fields recovered from a foot infec-
tion that kept him off the court, many expect-
ed him to struggle at the onset of the season.

Fields leads the team into action this week-
end when Pitt hosts the first two games of the
Legends Classic Tournament. The Panthers
face the Akron Zips tonight and play Indiana
University of Pennsylvania tomorrow.

Fields has come out of the gates on fire,
registering his first career double-double with
a career—high 12 assists against Miami Univer-
sity on Monday night in a 82-53 victory. After
two games, Fields is carrying a 20—to-1 assist-
to—turnover ratio, first in the country in that
category.

Freshman forward _Nasir Robinson recog-
nizes the importance of  Fields around.

“He’s our leader out there,” said Robinson,
who admitted that Fields has had a profound
impact on the development of his game.

Pitt will be without sophomore 
Gilbert Brown, as coach Jamie Dixon ruled
him out of both games this weekend. Brown
continues to nurse a stress fracture in his left
foot.

The Zips are coming 0E a very productive
campaign from last year, when they made the
NIT, beating Florida State in the first round
before losing to Massachusetts ir1 the second.

Akron enters toe_lay’s game with a 2-0 re-
cord, defeating Canisius in its opener last Sat-
urday, and \V1nthrop, an NCAA Tournament
team from last year, on Tuesday.

V/hile Pitt has been efﬁcient on the offen-
sive side of the ball in its first two games, it’s
 to have to continue to execute against
an Akron team that prides itself on defensive
intensity._- ‘

The Zips held Winthrop to only 14 points '

in the paint and forced 17 turnovers in their
game on Tuesday. Akron currently holds a
plus—1 5 turnover margin versus its opponents.

The Panthers  have to focus on attack-
ing the boards throughout the game, as Ak-
ron has been" outrebounded by its opponents

  looks to survive Weekend

by 16 through the first two games, while the
Panthers are currently outrebounding their op-
ponents by 18.

In Monday’s game, the Panthers did a poor
jobof controlling the boards in the first half,
allowing Miami to keep the score close for the
first 20 minutes

The Zips come into the battle with three
players averaging double ﬁgures in scoring

Junior guard Darryl Roberts is leading the
team in scoring at 13.5 points per game. For-
ward Chris McKnight,-who will most likely be
matched up against Dejuan Blair, is averaging
11 points and five rebounds through the first
two games. 1

Nate Linhart; a 6—feet—8-inch senior for-
ward, is averaging 10.5 points and eight re-
bounds, and he will be Pitt’s main concern to
keep off the glass

Pitt will counter, however, with its own ver-
sion of “the big three.”

Sam Young paces the team in scoring at '

14.5 points per game, while Blair and Fields
both average 13.5 points per game Fields is
averaging 10 assists, and Blair is averaging 11
rebounds a game.
Pitt will continue to look for shooting guard
Jermaine Dixon to keep up his outstanding
play in the absence of Brown. Dixon is the
fourth player on the team averaging in double
ﬁgures, at 10 points per game
In Saturday’s game,_the Panthers will face
off against Division II opponent IUP. This
matchup was originally scheduled to be an ex-
hibition game but was moved to a regular sea-
son contest; The Crimson Hawks come into
the contest with a 2-0 mark, with victories over
Thiel and Penn State Fayette
Fields doesn’t think the team has necessarily

found the  equation for victory despite _

thetwowins,andhethinksthismightbethe
most well—rounded team he’s ever been 

“I think we’re really  to show off our
depth this year,” said Fields.
