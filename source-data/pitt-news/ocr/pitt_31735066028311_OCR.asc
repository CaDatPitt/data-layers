Pitt never guaranteecl $30 million

said.

The legislature authorized the $30 mil-
lion in 1988, but long periods of time
often pass before an institution sees
authorized money. _

Unidentified Pitt officials and the state
made an agreement to forfeit $17 million
of the grant in order to receive an imme-
diate $13 million in December of 1993.

Ex—chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor was
in charge at the time of this deal.

Pitt Po/ice  
bust two for
possession
of crack

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Two individuals, one a Pitt
student, were arrested yesterday
as university police seized’
around $10,000 worth of crack
coc.;=’-:ne.

"These seem to be some very
serious drug dealers,” said Rick
Boyd, Pitt police chief.

Julius Riley, a 19-year-old
Pitt student, and Darnell Smith,
18, of’Hazelwood, were arrest-
ed after police found marijuana,
crack cocaine and drug para-
phernalia in one of the sus-
pects’ car.

Security officers outside
Children’s Hospital spotted two
people fighting in a car around

6p.m., and Pitt Police respond- 7

ed, attempting to break up the
fight. '

Boyd said the officers found a
portion of marijuana in the car
“in plain view,” and Smith

allowed the officers to search.

the inside.

“In addition to the marijuana,
approximately 90 grams of
crack cocaine, four pagers and
$2,810 in small bills were
found,” Boyd said.

The suspects are in custody
and will becharged with pos-
session of marijuana with intent

to sell, possession of cocaine .5

with intent to sell and conspira-
cy to deliver marijuana and
cocaine.

Boyd estimated the value of
the drugs seized is between
$5,000 and $10,000.

He said the large amount of
drugs siezed was unusaul.

SEAC riders want bike lanes in Pittsburgh

By Steve Westrick
Staff Writer

From the time we left
Meade Street, it was clear
that bicyclists get no respect
in Pittsburgh.

“Illegal pass on your"

right.”

“Illegal pass on your left.”

“Watch out, that car is rid-
ing your back wheel.”

These were all phrases that
one could hear bikers shout

to each other throughout the

day of riding.

We were riding in the
Critical Mass protest that
started at East End Food Co-
op in Point Breeze and went
\down Forbes Avenue

through the heart of Squirrel
Hill and Oakland.

Over 20 bikers showed up
in the rain to join in the
protest ride for bike lanes
in Pittsburgh.

All riders were given an
orange safety vest as a pre-
caution for riding on the wet
roads.

These safety vests were
quickly turned into moving
signs for the protest.

Some riders took the role
of peace-keepers and acted
as a safety barrier between
the riders and cars.

Before the protest began,
Josh Knauer, one ofthe
peace-keepers, addressed his
fellow riders to explain what

it "was they were going to do
on the protest ride.

“The point of what we are
doing today is to show the
city we need bike lanes and
further awareness of what
we need,” he said. “We will
do this by legally taking up

one lane and riding in V

protest. We are here to have
fun and get our point
across.”

Despite the rain, which
was now coming down fairly
hard, peace-keeper Distina
Corvin told her fellow bik-
ers, “It’s still going to be
fun, and our message is still
important. We will get our
point across.”

With all that said. it was

time’ to begin the protest
ride.

Minutes into the ride, a
tractor trailer truck took a
wide turn and hit the side-
walk beside us, shaking
electrical wires above our
heads. 

Screams ‘of “get over,
watch those wires” were
shouted out by the peace-
keepers.

The ride thenproceeded
down Squirrel Hill with
chants of “One less car!”
“Get out of your cars and
ride a bike!” and. “We need
bike 1anes!” I

Head to zoo for spooky weekencr

By Sheela Mirmira
For The Pitt News

. Think about what you_

did last Halloween.
Did you go out with your
friends? Did you head for

' the bars? Did you do any-

thing at all?
Year after year it seems
like the same thing. _

There’s never anything dif-
ferent to do. y I

iWell this year a different
kind of horror is lurking at
the Pittsburgh Zoo-
ZooBoo.

ZooBoo has been a long-
standing event at the zoo.
Around Halloween every
year, the Pittsburgh Zoo
transforms into a haunting-
ly festive area for people
of all ages. '

~ “Students ‘think
Halloween as just another
excuse to go out drinking,”

or

zoo’s public relations
department.
“Drinking requires

money. But the zoo is
another way for students to
have a good time with-
out spending so much.”

Julian also brought up
the issue of conservation.

“Why not come to sup-
port the environment?”
Julian said.

The Pittsburgh Zoo is
actively involved in envi-
ronmental protection.

It houses numerous
threatened and endangered
species.

The zoo is partof a
nationwide band of zoos
that have come together
to save animals that are
‘in danger. 7

_This year’s ZooBoo will
feature the Pittsburgh
Penguins’ Iceberg, as well
as various other surprises

You can take a spooky
train ride through the
African Savanna, walk
through the mysteries of
the sea in the AquaZoo or

.just walk through the fes-

tive light area. A .

“It’s a great way for stu-
dents to participate and
blend in with the children
in a safe environment,”

_ said Kim Adams of the

zoo’s marketing depart-
ment.

“Everyone can dress in
costumes and really get.

into the spirit of the occa-

sion.” A
ZooBoo~ takes place

tonight through Sunday,

from 6:30 to 9.
Tickets are only $4. So if

ent to do this Halloween,

the usual sounds of hon_king

30 million
°Frompagé1

Tim Reeves, a Ridge
spokesperson, saidlthe full
$30 million was never guar-
anteed anyway.

“Statistically, of every 10
projects that are authorized
by the legislature, usually
only one gets funded,”
Reeves said. “The legislature
authorizes many more
projects than the state can
afford to pay for.”

Vice Chancellor of
Business and Finance Ben
Tuchi, nor O’Connor,
could not be reached for
comment, and interim
chancellor Mark
Nordenberg was out of
town yesterday.

The decision to take less
money may have been -
made to secure at least a
portion of the funds.

Revelation of the agree-
ment came as a surprise to
many Pitt officials, and the
university has recently
insisted that the $30 million
authorization is still in
effect.

According to a Pitt press
release, “The. original act

whether Pitt intended to do

whether to give Pitt the addi-

Reeves said.

Because it takes so
long to receive state-
authorized money, many
universities make similar
agreements to receive
smaller amounts sooner.

A “There are dozen of

    Grow up, Pitt students

A .should not be punished any more. _

There seems to be a maturity problem around this campus late-
ly. You know who you are, the ones who are snickering behind
your hand or hiding your smile right now. Yes, you. The ones who
showed just how cool you could be when you threw that bottle at
the Pitt marching band. . '

No. this is not addressed to fans of a visiting football team. It is
addressed to some of our own fellow Pitt students. It might be
expected. though still juvenile for students from ANY college or
university, if the people throwing things were from a rival school.
But lately. Pitt fans have shown their lack of concern for other
people’s safety, lack of respect for"other people’s hard work, and
their own immaturity by tossing garbage and even bottles at the
band from the home field stands during the homecoming game.

. Pitt’s marching band practices 25+ hours/a week to play for the ,

team with the worst record in the Big East.‘ They put in a lotof
hard work to provide entertainment and spirit for games which

. could be downright miserable without them. But instead of saying

“good job.” some idiots have chosen to ﬂing garbage at "them.

Anyone who would resort to this kind of thing isn’t mature
enough even to be in college, especially when you are throwing
things at your own classmates. So here’s a little advice which
might help you in the long run —_— grow up.

Law makes sense

On Tuesday, Gov. Tom Ridge kept one of his campaign promis-
es when he signed what is being labelled “Megan’s Law” into act.
Once sexual offenders are released from prison, they are now
required by law (in Pennsylvania) to register. their addresses with

' local police for 10 years following their release.

Some groups have criticized Megan’s law as an infringement on
the rights of ex-convicts. They say once offenders have served
their ‘time in prison, they have paid their debt to society and

But requiring offenders to register their address is not infringing
_on their right to live wherever they want. Once they leave prison,
they have the right to do anything they want within the bounds of
the law. Registration only helps the police to track down offenders
whose pattern is similar to sexual offenses currently under investi-
gation. '

The recidivism rate of sexual offenders is, unfortunately, very
high. If the prison system had a better rehabilitation program to
prevent repeat offenses, then Megan’s Law might not be neces-
sary. But atleast for now, too‘ many “rehabilitated” sex offenders

are released from prison only to commit the same crimes again.

Registration of these offenders’ locations will assist police ‘in
tracking down offenders whose previous modus operandi resem-
bles or matches presently unsolved offenses. .

It does not hurt anyone to register his or her address with the
police. If the ex-con has no intention of committing another
crime, there should be no problem. And if they do revert to their
criminal leanings, the only ‘people who are hurt if they are not reg-
istered are their next victims.

GOP and Democrats Wage war

Berquist

ast year,
with the
election

of a new Republican Congress

for the first time in over 40
years, the new Speaker_of the
House, Newt Gingrich, declared
that a revolution had seized
hold of Washington and of
America itself. Time and
Newsweek magazines hailed the
beginning of a new political
order. Now it has become
apparent that the revolution has
lost its hold over the American
people. In their quest to over-
haul LBJ ’s Great Society of the
1960s, the Republicans seem
intent upon creating a Grim
Society for the 1990s.

In the past year, the “new”
Republican party has done
nothing to change politics and
government in America. The
much-hyped Contract With
America has had a negligible
impact upon the way the gov-
ernment does business.
Republican analyst Kevin
Phillips has derided the
Contract as being little more
than a “Contract With K
Street,” the Washington special
interest lobbying community.
Key components of the

. Contract, such as term limits

and the line—item veto, are now
dead issues in Washington.
Lawyers for special interest
groups’ wield extraordinary
power over Congress. Last
spring staffers for various mem-
bers of Congress were stunned
to find lawyers for timber,
ranching and mining lobbies
conducting meetings and rewrit-
ing laws without even bothering
to consult members of Congress
or their staffs. The Republicans
have done little more than hand
special interest groups a blank
sheet of paper and say, “Your
wish is our command”,
Phillips,'a critic of the two-
party system, has dismissed
Gingrich and his followers as
being, “ivory tower planners,
ideologues and second-rate pro-

. fessors.” Phillips also points out

that today’s conservative lead-
ers are intellectual elitists who
have never run a business or
met a payroll. He also warns
Republicans that, “today’s right-
wing zealots seem just as eager
as the 1960s liberals to ignore
the voter worries that they’re
going too far.” According to
Phillips, the Republicans are
washing away a golden oppor-
tunity to re-align American pol-
itics for decades to come.
Several prominent Democrats
recently jumped ship and
became Republicans in order to
continue to receive the perks

that go with being apmember of-,_
the majority party. Take, for‘.
of ‘

example, the case
Congressman Greg Laughlin of
Texas. Laughlin left the
Democratic party earlier this
year and watched as pork-barrel
money ﬂowed like a river into
his district. Just after switching
parties, a waiver was built into
the Clean Water Act to allow
the construction of a golf course
inside a wetland in Laughlin’s
district. While Gingrich has
tried to address these defections
as good news for the

Republican party, what it really 9

shows is that the old system of
securing votes by handing out
federal money is still very much
intact. People like Laughlin saw
which way the wind" was blow-
ing and switched sides.

' The Gingrich revolution has

become a bitter taste in the

mouths of voters. In a recent
poll, 49 percent of voters said
that special interests controlled
Washington, while only 25 per-
cent said that the Republican
Congress does. When two out
of three people" say that the
GOP is little more than a puppet
for special interest groups,
Gingrich should know that he
has a problem on his hands. To
make matters worse, 60 percent
of all Americans (and 50 per-
cent of all Republicans) favor
the creation of a third political
Party-

Rather than fatally torpedo

the faltering Democratic party.
the Republicans have breathed
new life into the Democrats and
have given President Clinton a
real chance of winning re—elec—
tion in 1996. Last year polls

said that it would take nothing

less than a miracle to re—elect
Bill Clinton. Now his re—elec—
tion prospects have gone from
doubtful to probable. Gingrich’s
popularity ratings recently
plummeted below 30 percent.
Gingrich even runs the danger

of seeing neoisolationist Pat.

Buchanan surpassing him in the
polls and of becoming the most
hated political figure on the

American political landscape.’
 Not since Richard Nixon has a

politician inspired such ire from
‘voters. Democrats are salivating
over the prospect of Gingrich
running for president and fatally
dividing the Republican party at
the moment of its greatest tri-
umph. ‘

In their quest for power. the
Republicans have sold out to
special interest groups and have
passed on a golden opportunity

to not only revamp the way the ‘

government does business, but
also to ensure that the
Republican party will be the
majority party for years to
come. The same old system of
backslapping politicians trading
votes for favors is still very
much the norm. The Gingrich
revolution has sadly failed in
what it set out to do in the first

GFOVE Granted,it

something different —— some-
thing that one would never
forget. _

While at Pitt footballcamp
watching the likes of Ryan, '
J ells and Tumulty, I felt
something inside that was
new. A feeling that,_yes, just
maybe, Pitt.would be good
this season. i _

Not just better than last
year, I mean really good. Not
the “I found a buck in these‘
dirty jeans” type good. Not
even the “I kissed my friend’s
sister” good. This was
GOOD.

Pitt had a decent QB com-
ing back and Billy West was
going to run people over
week in and week out. Jells
would be racing down the
sidelines picking up huge

 chunks ‘of yardage.

This was better than free
nudie channels on cable or
screwing Columbia House.

No more _3-8 crap, I was

catching a plane somewhere
out of Pittsburgh in
December and going some-

’ where warm; I did not care

where.'Pitt was finally out of
the cellar and on the rise.

In the first two weeks of the
season, the Panthers made -me
feel like this summer dream
was becoming reality. Was
this happening? Were the ‘

Panthers really 2-O? You bet. ‘

A spirited c_ome-from-
behind win at home against _
Washington‘State gave the

_ Panthers that much—needed,
“Hey, maybe we don't suck”
attitude. We were on our way.

' Steve Clay of Eastern
Michigan almost changed my
dream into a nightmare when

, he took the opening kickoff
93 yards for a score.
Thankfully, our beloved .
Panthers bounced back and
pounded the Eagles, 66-30, in

' what was the best game I’ve

' ever seen at Pitt Stadium.

Off to Texas, where the-
Panthers lost a tough game
that they should have won, ,
but that was OK. Next week
was the biggy —— the Ohio
State game. Now, this was the
coming out party for Pitt.
Upset the Buckeyes on

dream is still alivle. ,

Soccer beats Canisius

Thursday, October 26, 1995

for si)dh straight win  

By Ned Schano
For The Pitt News

The Pitt soccer team squeaked out a win last night,idefeating

Canisius 2- l.

The non—conference win raised Pitt’s overall record to 11-4 and
added to their season—high sixth straight win. The Panthers have

also won nine of their last 11 games.

The Panthers controlled the tempo early, as they dominated the
first half. Pitt outplayed Canisius but could not translate its efforts

into a goal. I V

The Panthers had a number of good scoring opportunities in the
first half, and they kept Canisius goalie Nick Christou active. At

Graf -notched his second goal of the sea-
son at 54:59. The goal was assisted by

Kopp, who extended his team-leading *

point total to 13.

Kopp made a crossing pass to Graf, who
buried it past the diving Christou in the
lower left corner of the net.

“On Todd’s goal, Drew made a nice
cross and Todd shot‘ it in,” coach
Luxbacher said. '

Pitt added what seemed to be an insur-
ance goal at 67:04., Senior forward Keith
Hoetzlein converted a header into the net
for his second goal of the year. The goal
was assisted by Matt Schell.

“Keith’s goal was critical to the game,”
Luxbacher said.

The Panthers looked like they were in
the driver’s seat, but their play deteriorated
after their second goal. I

“I was a bit disappointed we didn’t play
better after the second goal,” Luxbacher
said.

“We should have played a lot better,”
Porter said. “We should have scored
more.”

Canisius took full advantage of the situ-
ation and made the game interesting in the
final few minutes. The Golden Griffins got
on the scoreboard at 82:44 when Jeff
Donlon knocked a rebound shot past

nd Canisius player Todd Spitzer.

Something has to give in Pitt - Rutgers game

Alike, Pitt had a very,

By Mike Kovak

L Asst. Sports Editor

This Saturday the Pitt Panthers travel

"to Rutgers University, and the similari-

ties between the two teams are"amazing.
Pitt (2-6, 0-4) are losers of six consec-
utive ball games. Rutgers (1-5, 0-3) has
strung together four consecutive losses.
.“Both teams are similar,” said Rutgers
head coach Doug Graber. “We’re com-

we really” lost those »  
four games. It looks

very tough early season
schedule, that had an ,
effect ontheir team as 
well.” '

Much has been made
of Pitt’s rash of critical
injuries to its star play-
ers. Some say a suc-
cessful season.might
have been a reality.
When players like Billy
West, Denorse Mosley
and Reggie Thomas go
down, the excuse
appears legitimate.

The same story can _
be said for the Scarlet ‘

Knights. _
“We lost our two best‘ 
receivers, and lost

another senior receiv-
er,” Graber said.‘ “Also,

A quick look at Pitt’s depth chart
shows several new names. Sadiq
Durham has moved to the number two
split end. Other players like'Raymond
Belvin, Kenny Pegram, Maurice Harris
and Ken Kashubara have crept up on the
charts. '

With all the fresh faces on Pitt’s depth
chart, the appearance of ateam attempt-
ing to forge ahead to next season is evi-

 
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
   
  
 
  
 
 
  
  

dent.

“There is no one at all that I'm inter-
ested in getting into the ball game right
now that can help us win games now,”
Pitt head coach Johnny Majors said.

. “We are playing some young people. I,
in my mind, want to help us win a ball
game, right now.”

Both teams have lost to Virginia Tech
and Miami. The Panthers suffered two
of their most disappointing losses in
recent memory against
 these clubs. They fell
 26-l6.against Virginia

Tech, and 17-16
against Miami.
The Scarlet

Knights have not fared

to the Hokies 45-17
last week at home.

Pitt, a two-point
underdog, has history
on its side in this
matchup. The Panthers
have lost to Rutgers
only once in the 12-
game.series. The loss
, was suffered in 1992. a
21-16 defeat at
Rutgers Stadium. Pitt

This goal seemed to spark
the Golden Griffins, as they
put on an offensive onslaught
during the last eight minutes
of the game. Luckily for the
Panthers, Spitzer continued
his solid play in goal and
prevented the game from
going into overtime.

Pitt played well at times in
this game but was not able to

I" convert enough early scoring

opportunities.
“We had four chances [in

 R the first half] and couldn’t

score.'We didn’t play well,
but it was a win,” Porter said.

7 - The Panthers’ next game is
 against Big East conference

foe.Villanova on Sunday.
“[Villanova] is a very difﬁ-
cult team to play.”
Luxbacher said. “We are
going to have to up our level

of play.”
The Panthers currently are
in second place in the Big

../East and have aspirations of

winning the conference. In
order for the Panthers to win
the conference, they will
probably have to win their
final three games.

After the Villanova game,
the Panthers still have to play
at West Virginia on Nov. 1
and then finish the regular
season at home against
Georgetown on Nov. 4.

Before. the game, Pitt

, junior defender Bret Stezoski

was named to Soccer
America’s Team of the Week.
Stezoski, a cornerstone of the
Pitt defense, was also named
Big East Defensive Player of
the Week after stellar perfor-
mances against Rutgers and
Syracuse.

°From page 5

It was not that easy. Bobby Hoying and Co. rolled over the
Panthers in the second half and went back to Columbus with a
55- 14 win.

But 2-2 wasn’t all that bad, I guessed. Virginia Tech was
next, and I knew we could win that one. They. were not that
good, but as the couple thousand fans soon realized, neither
was Pitt.

Pitthad every chance to win that game and "turn the year
around, but as usual the Panthers blew it. A 26-16 loss hurt and
hurt badly. Boston College was the next stop for this traveling
band of merry men. ’

Those nice guys up in Chestnut Hill welcomed Pitt and pro-
ceeded to pitch a pretty 17-O shutout. A—ha, 2-4 and falling fast,
but could doom be right around the corner? There was no way,
at least I thought, wetcould lose to Temple.

Those Panthers were crafty, though. They went out and
proved everyone wrong that drizzly Saturday night in October.
Who woulda thunk it? If Temple lost to Bowling Green, Pitt
could surely squeeze a win against the lowly Owls. Sorry, try
again. Temple 29-Pitt 27.

That was the lowest point that the Panthers could have
reached, and they did it. There were two bright spots, however,
about the loss at Temple. One, it was on the radio, and two,
John Ryan was finally yanked at quarterback and replaced by
Pete Gonzalez.

Gonzalez came out the next week against the Hurricanes and
scorched a terrible Miami secondary for four of 20 passing and
100 yards. Good thing the couple thousand fans at the game
were so drunk, or Majors may have been lynched. (Maybe that
would have been a good thing, now that I think about it.)

What have the Panthers earned now? How about an all-
expense-paid trip to beautiful New Brunswick, N.J., to face the
1-5 Scarlet Knights of Rutgers. »

At the beginning of the season, in my dream world, this was
a pit stop on the way to a 7-4 season. That has changed. This is
now a must-win game for Pitt. Must-win for respect, but more
importantly for pride.

The season is a loss for the Panthers, but a loss at Rutgers
could crush any dreams in the future for the coaches, players
and fans.

If I could go back and change one thing, I really wish some-
one would have woke me while I was dreaming. Rutgers 14-

.- Pitt 10.

Matt Grove is a columnist for The Pitt News and sometimes
has really nice dreams.

Pitt

Scoring is another concern for both clubs.

Pitt has tallied 43 points in its last two losses. In the two
losses combined, the offense did not tally 600 yards.

For the Scarlet Knights, moving the football is not the prob-
lem. The offense, which features All-American candidate
Marco Battaglia and Terrell Willis, is first in the Big East
conference, averaging 441.4 yards a game. Its rushing offense
also ranks first in the conference averaging 212.4 yards a
game. . ~

Success moving the ball does not result in victories — just
ask the Steelers. Rutgers ranks only sixth for scoring offense
in the Big East. It averages 22.6 points per game. That’s still
more than the Panthers, who average 21.6 points per game.

“We have poor field position all the time. We have not got-
ten turnovers from the defensive side. We have a long field to
deal with all the time,” Graber said.

An Ening at th rnd

‘ Guignol

directed by Kevin J. Wetmore
Jr.

Ph.D. candidate Kevin
Wetmore is known as the
‘‘intellectual’’ of Pitt’s theater
community. He is well-versed
in the classics of Western the-
ater and contemporary
Japanese and African theater
forms along with the history of
practically every artistic move-
ment ever known. In short, he
is a learned man. His analyti-
cal prowess is evident in the
productions that he has direct-
ed here at Pitt. Last year’s
Fuente. Ovejuna and Cardenio
were. indicative of a style ‘of
directing that stressed a prob-
ing intellectual depth and an‘
innovative theatrical force that
did not rest on convention.

Not surprisingly, when I
asked Wetmore about the
intentions and goals-behind An
Evening at the Grand Guignol,

he responded with a slew of
.-psychological, artistic and his-
torical underpinnings that
revolve around the theater of
the Grand Guignol and the
necessity for staging it. The
theater of the Grand Guignol
[“Guignol” was used to signify
a generic name for Punch and
Judy puppet characters] grew
out'of the naturalistic tradition
in France near the end of the
19th century and was typified
by mad behavior and violence.»
Horror, with psychological
undertones, was created as a
genre with the theater of the
Grand.Guignol. Playwrights
such as Andre de Lorde and
Henri Bauche wrote about sub-
jects like insanity, imprison-
ment, vengeance and mysteri-
ous death. The concept of the
psychological thriller had its
beginnings in the Grand
Guignol, and Wetmore said
that he wanted to “mix psycho-
realism with comedy” to make
a show that is disturbing and

 
 
   

funny at the
time.Wetmore also chose to
direct the Grand Guignol
because, although it is rather
obscure, the theater of the
Grand Guignol is rather influ-
ential in’ areas such as horror
film, theater and psychology.

However, after all the afore-
mentioned “mental masturba-
tion” [as Wetmore himself calls
it], the show is just plain fun.
lt’s fun to act like a madman,
to scream, to be scared of
what might be there and to be
involved in an adventure that
could include death, blood and
scary stuff. All of the above are
included in Pitt’s Evening at
the Grand Guignol, along with,
for the most part, convincing
performances. » i

The show consists of 2 one-
act plays — “The System of
Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether,”
which is based on an Edgar
Allan Poe short story, and “The
Laboratory of Hallucinations,”
a play by Andre de Lorde and

 

same

former is rather simple and
rather disturbing. Two journal-
ists [John Koch and Leanne
Lennon] visit Dr. Tarr [David
Novinski], who has supposedly
created a treatment to cure
insanity. Screams are heard in
adjacent rooms, accompanied
by Dr. Tarr’s laughter. When
his colleagues and assistants
[Kenyatta Rogers, Lori
Sharpless, Flay Burtoff] join
him and seem a bit strange,
the journalists begin to wonder
who really is insane. They
finally discover that insane
patients have taken over the
roles of. doctor and attendant.
Guards [Christina Petrill_o,
Heather Wiltanger and Tim
Wisnieski] rescue the journal-
ists at the last minute and
reveal a rather unsettling end-
ing. _
The cast of An Evening at
the Grand Guignol is on a
well-orchestrated cohesive

Heri Bahe. The story of th tawareof and respetful f

 
 
  

each other. John Koch, howev-
er, is the one exception. As

usual, -he wrecks the rhythm‘

and kinesthetic balance that is
skillfully maintained by all of
the other actors. Koch is so
bland and lifeless that, after a
few minutes on stage, I forgot
that he possessed a body and
a personality and thought that
a robot who was programmed
to speak and react at prede-
fined times was reciting his
lines.

But Koch’s talentlessness
does not take away from the
overall quality of the perfor-
mance. David Novinski is
remarkable in his portrayal of
the mad doctor impersonator.
Describing him as hilarious
would be an understatement,
and his capacities for physical
and vocal expressivity reflect a
learned maturity about the
stage. Kenyatta Rogers is
another standout, as his move-

level where each actor is _guigno'p15

that I am a genuine prophet.
And as l sit here munching on
fresh baked pumpkin cookies
(3 for a dollar at an Oakland
bakery) and sipping on pump-
kin lyrics, I reflect on some 0’
the sounds that have made
their way into my milk carton
crates thus far. Some rekin-
dled love affairs with The
Cocteau Twins, Clutch,
Catherine Wheel, Joy
Division, Cornershop, Ride

and now The Smashing-

Pumpkins have kept me soni-
cally satisfied and a nuisance
to the neighbors. l know you’re
probably wondering if Mel/on
Collie and the inﬁnite Sadness
is good or not. Well, of course
the album is splendid beyond
beyond expectation, you idiot!
What you should be wondering
is “how good is it?”~ and “will I
be able to leave my room for a
month after listening to it?”

My only problem with the
album is the name. Personally,
I think the album should be
called Jupiter and Chloe, but l
can’t convince Billy to change
it (he's so damn stubborn). lt’s

V imperative that you know that

Mellon Collie and the Infinite
Sadness is produced by Alan
Moulder and Billy Corgan,
which is equivalent to Zeus
and Apollo playing jack rocks
on the Elysian Fields. l’ve
often had shameless carnal
fantasies about both of them,
and on this album I experi-
enced the fruits of their talents
simultaneously. No, I’m not
crazy, but I amsmiling!

In all accuracy, listening to
this album is like having my
palm read and gently kissed.
Siamese Dream was a brief
and unforgettable rune rawk

‘readn, bu this album

 

 

IS a
complete and genuine psychic
experience without the 900
numbers and Dionne Warwick.
(if i ever hear Dionne Warwick
on a Smashing Pumpkins
album, l’ll shave my head and
start a tambourine collection.)
The album has a very mythi-
cal, mystical type of theme. its
beautiful!!! lt’s a double album
(Paul doesn't like double
albums, he’d rather get the.b-
sides), which wonderfully
adheres to the duality of the
soul.

The first album, Dawn to
Dusk, starts with a “melan—
cholic and infinitely sad” piano
solo with violin strings of hope
wailing in the background.
“Tonight, Tonight” is the alter

ego of ‘‘Today.’’ it lifts on with

Suede-like soap box, lo-fi twirl
and then it welcomes the mil-
lennium with wide mouth out-
stretched rolling drum beats.
its one of those songs which
you will listen to 5,000 years
from now.

i must warn you that none of
the songs on this album are
bad. In fact, I listened to Dawn
to Dusk seven times before I
even remembered the second
album Twilight to Starlight.
“Bu|let with Butterfly Wings,”

the single, reminds me of my

best friend Johnas, because it
is intentionally immature, bratty
and repetitious. These are
some of the qualities I look for
in a friend, and I love it in my
music as well. One of the most
impressive‘ characteristics of
Dawn to Dusk is the blood
brother relationship between
Bil|y’s lemon juice vocals and
the raspy, rancorous instru-
ments. I look up, and to my
splendid horror, the sounds

are discordantly falling straight

at me and can’t tell the differ-
ence until they finally crashed
into all of my senses, including
taste. “Love” represents the
Smashing Pumpkins’ mastery
of sonic psychedelia with little

 .october 26   1 995-

 
 

  

pieces of electronic candy
bursting in the background.
“Cupid de Locke” puts you on
a'beautiful blue island all by
yourself where the only law is
to close your eyes and contin-
uously sway your head back
and forth in harmony with the
breezes. The song is short just
like a fantasy. “Muzzle" is

pleasant with with its machete’

vocals and machine gun
drums. “Porcelina-of the Vast
Oceans” has a sound that is
just as awesome as the title. It
should be played at maximum
volume during quiet hours.
James lha and D’arcy kick a
couple tunes around in “Take
Me Down.” James lha has the
most awesome hair, and there

is a guy on this campus who‘

looksjust like him.

The second album, Twilight
to Starlight, fizzles eternally in
your ears and leaves a metal-
lic film in your speakers. its so
wonderful!!! “Bodies,” a song
in which Billy continuously
reminds us that “love is sui-
cide,” is powerfully addictive
with its static melody. “Where
Boys Fear to Tread” intro-
duces the band, as Brett
Anderson would say, with
pleasantly unsuccessful tuning
which switches to a harmo-
nious metallic collaboration
(that is possible, you know).
One of my favorites is “1979”
simply because it was digitally
remastered on Pluto (you
know, the gaseous outer plan-
et in our solar system). It has
this electro-echo swingirig
from a silky thread of smooth
vocals. “Stumbleine” has an
acoustic awkwardness remi-
niscent of “Landslide” minus
the sore throat. “We‘Only
Come Out At Night” would be
an appropriate theme song for
A Clockwork Orange sequel.

One song that l subcon-
sciously predicted would be on
the album is “By Starlight.”

BILL R'll2CHNE'R SEES‘ RIGHT THROUGH NADJA

   

Nadja
Written and directed by
Michael Almereyda

With Elina Lowensohn, Martin
Donovan and Peter Fonda

Time-Warner mass pro-

j duces the indie rock sound.
 R.J. Reynolds is now churning

out indie cigarettes. (Moonlight
just a
Winston/Camel packaged to
fool all you suckas tryin’ to be
different.) Director Michael
Almereyda retells the vam-
pire/Dracula story with as
much black and white indie
film flair as he could muster for
a few millions.

In Nadja, Almereyda tries to
synthesize indie film staples
like black and white,
Pixelvision, extended mon-
tage, etc., even down to the
underacted neo-new wave dia-
logue a la Jim Jarmusch and
friends. Nadja even gets the
hip stamp of David Lynch as
executive producer and the
likes of Peter Fonda, Easy
Riders Captain America, trying
to prove himself still eclectic,
eccentric and crazy after all
these years.

In this version of the vampire
yarn, the dear Carpathian

'_ count has been done in by the

mountain-bike-riding, hippy-in-

 a-tweed-jacket Van Helsing

(Peter Fonda) — with a stake
through the heart of course.
Meanwhile, in nighttime

 



Count’s perfectly pasty and
beautiful daughter Nadja (Elina
Lowensohn) uses her powers
to remove daddy from the
morgue and dispose of him
properly to ensure his com-
plete death. It seems the old
Count was a bit of a tyrant,
and Nadja is only too happy to
see daddy dearest gone.

These characters become.

conveniently entwined when
Van Helsing’s nephew Jim
(Martin Donavan) bails out his
uncle and joins him in a night
of drinking and indulging in the
paranoid possibilities of vam-
pire revenge. This leaves Jim’s
wife Lucy (Galaxy Craze -—
great name, weak actress)
unmet as her husband
promised earlier. Conveniently

alone, Lucy does the depres-
sion shuffle to a nearby bar
where she meets who else but
the aching Nadja.

Lucy sits entranced as the
deep, dark pale one tells her
tale with flashbacks interrupted
by inane conversation like this:
Lucy: Where are you from?
Nadja: I was born by the Black
Sea, under the shadow of the
Carpathian Mountains.

Lucy: is the Black Sea really
black?
Nadja: It's blue, actual/y.

What the director misses
time and again with this film is
the endless possibility for
camp in his own screenplay.
It's enough to make you wan-
der off mid-film to the possibili-
ties if Nadja were directed by

 " ~//.///’r'//V‘///74W. .v

 

      

Almodovar instead of
Almereyda. Now that would be
a movie.

But Almereyda is too
obsessed with creating an
ethereal feel and wants to
immerse us in the tortured
journey of the undead. He
does it by creating Vampire
Vision Pixelvision
sequences from Nadja’s POV.
She kills her first nameless vic-
tim in Vampire Vision, she
seduces the dopey Lucy in
Vampire Vision, she stalks the
naked city in Vampire Vision.
Why? Because as Fonda’s
Van Helsing keeps mention-
ing, she’s not like us. Ooooh.
Creepy.

Really, it just feels like an
excuse to exploit Almereyda’s

 

 

other tendency, and that is to
create an incredibly artsy
music video full of effects,
superimposition and blurring
montage set to Portishead
songs. How gothic.

But Almereyda seems lost in
his own foolishness and pre-
tense. The surreal Chiaroscuro
charm is laughable. When
interviewed, Almereyda said,
“The point is, Pixe|vision’s
rough and raw but, like feed-
back in a good harsh punk
song, it has its own peculiar
eloquence.” Hmmm. I smell a
pretentious high-art wanker
once again delving into lo-fi
culture and trying to dredge it
up for their own bastardized
uses in order to remain eter-
nally hip. Listen, no punk
should be described as having
“peculiar eloquence.” And
feedback’s free, baby.

While Coppola’s Dracula
was a grand costume action-
adventure and Abel Ferrara’s
The Addiction another of his
efforts to be the postmodern
Peckinpah, Almereyda’s Nadja
is an indie director trying to tell
a very old story with only the
most up-to-date and modern
filmic cliches. lt’s independent
cinema trying very hard to look
independent — a film hoping
you’ll be mesmerized so thor-
oughly with its borrowed,
excessive stylizations that
you’ll not notice it has nothing
much to say.

-bi/I kirchner

 

  

should tip you oftt that a root down is
happening in the music industry. Listen
to the Beastie Boys’ “Sure Shot” and

Matthew Sweet’s Girlfriend album; the _

cult of vinyl isn’t just making a cameo.
it’s making a comeback like Cleveland
in the World Series.

There’s something unique about
vinyl. The album's photograph is more
inviting because of it’s obvious large_
size — you can pick out the goop on
Sebadoh’s Bakesale (near the bath-
tub). lts cheaper price tag — check a
local mom & pop record store. Just for
the’ collector, it takes up a lot of space
— check out Jerry’s Records in
Squirrel Hill. With so much style, why
did it go away?

LPs dropped 25 percent, according to
Billboard magazine. At the same time,
CD sales jumped 150 percent. As a
result, many record companies out
back on their LP production and raced
to market the CD. In 1988, vinyl sales
dropped 49 percent, and the industry
had a new baby that was shiny, easy to
maintain and digital.

Analog the Underdog

With compact discs averaging $17
apiece, only the affluent collector can
afford to buy them regularly.
Comparatively, vinyl is close to $8
apiece, half the price of the CD.

in Oakland’s Sam Goody, their vinyl
section is compromised of a few mis-
placed Van Halen LPs, priced at $5.98.
Teri McConnell, assistant manager,
says “vinyl has no market with compact
disc” in their mainstream.

Audiophile Rich Puerzer has a collec-
tion of 1,200 vinyl records and 600
compact discs. “Certainly, price affects
me when l buy music,” Puerzer insists.
“When I buy vinyl, that means l get to
buy more; two records for almost one
CD,” he says. While vinyl’s cheaper
price appeals to many, compact discs
have conveniences. “CDs are just easi-
er to use. You bring them almost any-
where and listen to a CD repetitively
without getting up to flip a record to the
other side,” he says. _

In analog recording, sound waves
are transcribed as grooves onto a vinyl
disc. The grooves are then traced by a
stylus in the tone arm of the turnable to
re-create the sound. In digital record-
ing, the music is sampled by a
microchip at the rate 44,100 ‘times a
second and expressed as a series of
binary codes, one and zeros. Encoded
in invisible “pits,” the numbers are read
by a player equipped with a laser
beam,'which relays the information to a
microcomputer that converts the codes
back to sound. A nice technology.

Digital recordings, the critics contend,
are devoid of the warmth that marks
the best analog recordings. Heading a
new effort to create better sounding
vinyl, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, a pio-
neer in the music market, offers a new
line of high fidelity. Where most albums
average 140 grams, Mobile’s LPs
weigh a hefty 200 grams. The thicker

tried to stop myself from going into
every single Bleecker Street record
store. But l couldn’t. A friend would
grab an LP and ecstatically say, “This

ferred collectors item, and the music
industry is releasing limited CDs to
grab our attention — and dough.
Warner Brothers repackaged The
Smiths into the CD format and sold a
series of two separate compact discs.

the former owner, but the
important part is the vinyl is
still good. »“We sell some
really good music here,”
says Rayschich. “A lot of

they can't find elsewhere.”

‘‘I Just Wanna Rockl”
Although LP sales have
dropped off, vinyl continues
to thrive in a different medi-
um —— that of the jukebox.

There are over 400,000 _

jukeboxes throughout the
world, and only 50,000 con-
verted to CDs. That’s a
whole lotta wax.

LP onvinyl, a week prior to
the CD, it entered the

Epic Records, Pearl Jam’s
label, shipped 75,000 copies
and sold 33,500 in the first

Soundscan. ._
Local musician Karl
Hendricks sold homemade
tapes of his early efforts to

7-inch vinyl because that’s
how he wanted to see it.
When he formed The Karl
Hendricks Trio, music mater-

 

ial was put on vinyl, and now
the Trio can be heard on the
hi-fi CD. ‘‘I prefer vinyl, per-
sonally, and that had to do
with why our earlier stuff
came out on it,” Hendricks
said. However most
Americans have CD players,
and that’s the only way to
reach them.

Ray Rotuna of Boxcar 5‘

follow-up a compact disc.
“We recorded a compact

Karl Hendricks said,
“There are a lot of people
who aren’t prepared for the

Now that mall-based
stores have decided that
vinyl is cold-ass fashion,
they’ve been stocking their
shelves with vinyl and CD

clothing and ugly glasses
frames, vinyl is back and

Let’s think of what West
Virginia is all about. Hill peo-
ple, banjos and inbreeding are
the first things that come to

' mind, but how about skate-
.- f boarding? Deep in the wooded

' V western portion of this strange
 land lies a skate mecca for
 ,those travelling the East

 Coast.

So it’s about nine in the
morning on the last Saturday
of September, and the
Weather Channel promises a
weekend of sunshine and
skating. Three of us sit in the
car drinking legal ampheta-
, mines (coffee), flying down I-
9 bitching about too much
, beer and lack of sleep due to
i the excitement level surround-
fing the trip. Anyway, with the
isappearance of the coffee
omes the last hour of the trip.

final stretch into the mountains
of this untouched country.

With the fall of vert skating in
the late ‘80s, many of the
ramps and skaters seemed to
fade away, while others opted
to move underground. Brewce
Martin was one of those who
decided that the hills of West
Virginia were the perfect place
to start his own skate utopia.
The ramp became an offering
to the Gods and was built so
that anyone could come and
sample this huge structure and
leave there changed for life.
The ramp lies 10 feet from his
humble house where his family
resides and where the doors
are never closed, or even on
the hinges.

Back to our place of resi-
dence for the weekend, Dave’s
car. We made it to Brewce’s
road, which winds up the
mountain with very few houses
or trailers scattered along the
mountainside. Only after see-
ing the stickers on the street
signs saying “Have a Hardcore
Day’ did we know for sure that
we were there. The four-hour
drive only took three, and we
caught up to a car from South
Carolina that led right to the
spot. it was about noon, and
the second day of the official
party was already underway.
As we got out of the car, we
were greeted with hoots and
hollers from people we didn’t
even know, but they knew why
we were there.

As we walked towards the
giant structure, saying hi to
everyone, we saw one of the
Pittsburgh crew. Suede left
Friday morning and gave us
the lowdown of the activity. We
sat down at what came to be
known as Fort Florida for
some pre-session activity.
After a few offerings to the
Skate Gods, we padded up for
the session. Thrasher was
there on Friday, but they
missed out on the best session
of the weekend, Saturday

night.

Many of the skaters had
been there all week and had
the place wired. Up on the
deck for the midday session,
we met up with some skaters
whom we had met in the early
summer in Columbus who
then went to Brewce’s and had
been there on his lawn ever

had been camped there for a
week before the official gather-
ing. Let me ask you this: what

in one state, call that number
and be at some stranger's
house in another state with a
welcoming as if you were fami-
ly? it’s the greatest feeling to
be able to travel somewhere to
do something that you love
knowing you'll meet some
good people and have a place
to stay. The greatest feeling
comes from this sort of broth-
erhood happening with about

150 people to share it with.

One of the other things that
makes skating such a fun
activity is that all skaters are
constantly behind each other
so that no matter what the abil-
ity level of the skater is he'll
get the same cheers as the
pro for pushing the limits of his
own ability. The person drop-
ping in for the first time gets
just as many cheers as the
one doing eight-foot airs. With
sessions such as these, the
brotherhood in skating seems
to be on the comeback with
the Vert scene.

So anyway, back. to the com-
pound. The session died down
a little as many took time out
to feast and make more peace
offerings to the gods as they
blessed us with the incredible

weekend. The food flowed, the
bands set up on the deck, and
the sound system Brewce
rented kicked out some Minor
Threat. The session began
heating up again, and soon
there were close to fifty people
on the decks trying to get a run
in. With each trick, the skaters
were pushing the limits of their
ability _and going far beyond.
The bands started to play, and
the party started to rage. The
32-foot-wide, 11-foot-high
structure was filled with
skaters, photographers and
partiers when “The Naked
Guy," a.k.a. Dave Maxwell

 

insane. To get the session
going, he donned nothing but
sneakers and dropped in on a
little plastic banana board with
fireworks taped to it and pro-
ceeded to rip through an
insane run, beer in hand. Then
Brewce, Kenny “The He|lbi|ly,”
and the rest of the locals took
center stage and showed how
to rule the place. I swear that
the ramp caught on fire when
Brewce was on: he skated so
fast and so solid, and he
wouldn't fall off. The skating
and music continued into the
night with Bunjie Jambo play-
ing and nothing stopping until
the dew on the ramp made it
too slippery. The Ft. Florida
Choir closed the night with its

own version of G.G. Allin s
greatest hits. Many cans of
beans and more offerings to
the gods closed the night, and
everyone passed out in tents,
cars or, in Sebastian's case, a
patch of wet grass.

The sun rose, and, as soon
as the dew dried, the skating
commenced with a little morn-
ing warm-up session, and
once again libations were
made-. Since many people had
to leave, Sunday was more
mellow, but the skating was
intense as the last runs were
taken by many. The troops
from all over the east said their
goodbyes and made their way
back to South Carolina,
Florida, Virginia, Maryland,

Ohio, Pennsylvania and '
Massachusetts. Others stayed
for the second week due to
broken-down cars or just to
enjoy more of Brewce’s hospi-
tality. Still others made plans
to meet in Charleston for the
Halloween party at that ramp.

Before I go, I just want to
say hi to Lambda Lambda,
Lambert; Sebastian; Joe P.;
George “The Dragon,” Suede
and The Sniffer, all of whom
represented Pittsburgh. Also,
a special thanks to Brewce
Martin for opening his home to
all of us for a place to seek
freedom and expression"
through skating, and I hope
the landlord relaxes a bit and
the ramp stays.

Sly’s falsetto coos and creaks

touch of sophistication, like the
swirly girlies in too-tall plat-
forms. They take slow drags
from their Virginia Slims and
nod their heads to the splash-

forward. “Sly knows funk,"

hot damn! A dangling-by-a-
guitar-string sound casts the
spell of James Brown’s “The
Big Payback.” This grimy funk
makes you shake on your

almost fall off. You abandon
your highball, which waits
patiently for you to stop shak-

red go-go boots.

can't stand the sappy senti-

curse the DJ. He throws on
Curtis Mayfie|d’s “Walk on By,”
and you bust a move. The yel-
low ceiling lights reflect off the
dangling gold earrings of the
fly honey with the irresistible
mouth as Curtis’ skittish funk
guitar and smooth falsetto dig
a groove so deep that you
almost completely miss the

tal mess. Your imagination
flashes a brief picture of you
and your dancing partner
dressed as a bride and groom,
your momma crying loudly that
her baby’s gone off and gotten
himself anotherwoman to take
care of him. Instantly, you put
that chaotic vision aside, and
you and Sheila enjoy the light,
lilting sound of “Tired of Being
Alone,” a ruby of a song by Al
Green. The Reverend’s got a
swinging groove that makes
your body move, and you’re_ all
warmed up when the O’Jays
ride their “Love Train” into your

V ears. The disco-string arrange-

ments pour from the sound
system like the steady flow of
tequila from the bottle in the
bartender’s hand as he yells
for tonight’s last call. The silver
clock above the bar proudly
presents the late hour as the
responsibilities of daily life
slowly creep back, occupying a
spot in your conscious. You
and Sheila make your date for
Saturday, and after a passion-
ate embrace, exchange good-
byes. You walk out the door,
the sensitive skin on your
freshly kissed lips scorned by

the cold world outside.

it usually means it fronts the
best music that this town has
to offer. Think of past winners
like Brownie Mary and Rusted
Root, and you ‘suddenly find
yourself in a circle of some
pretty successful friends. The
band D.O.S.E. (not the acid) is
the latest to win the honor.
This means it gets to record a
CD and then go back and have
a CD-release party. If anything,
their recently released CD Sex
With Sara falls short of the pre-
vious ultra-original, ecclectic
sounds that past winners have
generated. In fact the whole
CD sounds like a regurgitated
lunch bag full of previous local
talent.

The first track, “Dope,” starts
out with a hypnotic drum beat
which is layered over by a
funky bass line. As you begin
to twist and turn to that pepper-
shaker sound of Rusted Root,
the song takes a quick turn into
some heavy distortion and
pounding drums. You fall to the
ground in despair as you sud-
denly realize this is KELLY
AFFAIR! No wait. lt’s D.O.S.E.
Never mind.

Every song on the CD
seems to follow the predictable
pattern of Rock Band Trying
To Be Different. The grunge
factor has not been lost on
D.O.S.E. Most of their songs
start out soft and thoughtful
and proceed to kick in with
some heavy riffs and deep,
meaningful lyrics. In “Horsefly,”
singer Jason Trunzo croons,
“of course i have a horsefly/of
course i do/why don’t you?”

Today was a lousy day, until
I checked my mailbox and
found the DIY Guide. This is
the most useful zine that I've

‘ read in a long time, and cliched

as it may sound, if you only get
one zine that l’ve reviewed so
far, get this one. It's that good.
What it does, basically, is list
short articles on how to do vari-

ous things for yourself. It's 117

pages long, and most of the
articles are less_ than five
pages, so there’s a lot of differ-
ent stuff here. My personal
favorites were the ones on
putting out records and CDs,
because it presented the.most
detailed account of how to go
about that process that l’ve
ever seen, and the one on how
to get your rent deposit back,
because I have a feeling that
l’mgoing to use that one all too
soon.

I would advise a lot of cau-
tion with some of the articles,

- especially the ones on how to

induce abortion or make psy-
choactive drugs. l’ve seen this
information before, so it’s not
like it’s not out there, but I just
don’t think you should be tak-
ing chances by putting poten-
tially dangerous drugs into your

. system. Sometimes it’s not

really worth it to do it yourself.
The article on how to make
bombs should prove very pop-
ular with certain government
types, I hear they like to make
friends with anyone who tells
people how to do that. At least
it might prove that you don’t
have to use the Internet in
order to find out how to blow

things up. There were also a

lot of slightly more mundane
articles on things like stereo,
bike and auto-repair and main-
tenance. Anyway, you should
get this, because almost every-
one that I know could find at
least one article that they could
use in here, and you would
save enough money to more
than pay for this zine through
that. I

Maybe you could use the
one on how to make beer,
since it seems like hard times
have fallen on underage
drinkers in Oakland. Also, the

editorsplan on .putting this out.

on a regular basis, so I hope
they get a lot of support so
they can continue this. It's
available for $3 from: P.O. Box

_ and it's a bargain at twice the

price.

I also got
Research fanzine #4 in my
mailbox today. The author is
someone who obviously is very
politically motivated and active,

and he has some ‘normal’ zine- L

type stuff like interviews and
zine reviews, but almost every-
thing else is slanted toward
inspiring the reader to become
active.

There’s a long piece in the
middle about how to think criti-
cally that probably sums up a
lot of the author’s ideals quite
nicely. It's all about disregard-
ing hearsay and backing your
opinions up with research, and

a copy of

while most of the stuff in it
seems really common sense, it
was great to see it all written
out.

One thing in this zine that
was really refreshing to see
were book reviews instead of
the usual record reviews. If you
read a lot of zines, sometimes
record reviews tend to get
redundant, as you see the
same ones over and over. But
you almost never see anything
about books, and I’m a lot
more likely to go get a book out
of the library based on a review
than I am to buy a record.

I also liked the interview with
Jeff from Fifteen (the band, not
that Nickelodeon TV show).
Instead of focusing on the tra-
ditional band-type questions,
Jeff talks a lot about how politi-
cal things can have an effect
on people’s everyday lives. I
know I’m making this zine
sound really dense and dog-
matic, and some parts of it
tend in that direction (like the
introduction), but it’s a lot more
readable than I thought some-
thing like this could be.

This goes for $2 through the I

mail, and I don’t have the
address on me, but I’m sure I
could get it if anyone e-mails
me-for it. I '
Thanks for- all the mail and
zines. Any comments, blah,
blah, blah: jjcst25@pitt.edu.

ments and his motivations are
always precise, and most
importantly, clear. Christina
‘Petrillo is always exacting and
convincing in her perfor-
mances, and her work in
Grand Guignol is no excep-
tion. Leanne Lennon shows
some sincerity in her role as
the inquisitive journalist, and

» although glints of real artistic

gumption show up now'and
then, her performance is lack-
luster. But as a whole, I
thought the show moves in a

positive direction and accom-

plishes some good things:
produces a quality work of art,
combines skills of talented
theater artists and, most
importantly, provides a show
that is fun to watch. g
An Evening at the Grand
Guignol is not the sort of
show that is often staged here
in Pittsburgh,‘ but it's probably
the most exciting. I recom-
mend all those interested in a
good time to see An Evening
at the Grand Guignol,
because, unlike so many uni-

versity productions, being at

theater-goer or a scholar isn’t
required to have a good time.

An Evening at the Grand
Guignol previews tonight and
opens tomorrow night thru
Nov. 4 at the Pit Theatre, cor-
ner of Senno_tt and Bouquet
streets. Curtain at 8 p.m..
Tues. — Sat. and 2 p.m. Sun.

i am so excited about this
album! Mellon Collie and the
Infinite Sadness is, an album
with a wing span. I want to
have children just so they
could experience its aerial
techniques. If you’re a true
and obsessed fan like-me,
then you should have a copy
of their 12-inch import to pre-

'serve the cassette for when

you’re walking to class ignor-
ing people, and the compact
disc for your sub-conscious
listening pleasure. And start
training for the b-sides and
bootleg marathon. By the way,
I’m not at all partial to the
Smashing Pumpkins. If you
don’t get the album, it’s your
infinite loss, pal.
