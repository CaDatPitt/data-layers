of the periodical room,‘ ﬁfth ﬂoor
Cathedral, Dr. John W. Oliver,
chairman of the committee, an-
nounced today-.

More than 300 items are available
at the information center, and if

2,000 items will be catalogued by
. July 1, according to Dr. A. L. Rob-
inson, associate professor of chem-
istry and chairman of the informa-

tion center sub—committee.

Established at the request of the
U.S. Office of Education, the Uni-
versity morale desk will provide
information concerning the war for

- study by students, faculty, and the
general public, and will serve as

a “key center of information and.

training” for the Western Pennsyl-
vania area.

Lorena A. Garlock, chief refer-
ence librarian has been placed in
charge of the center. Commenting
more speciﬁcally on the information
available, Miss Garlock said there
is material that can be used by
speakers, debaters, program chair-
men of church and club groups, li-
brarians, teachers, and students
who have writing or research as-
signments in subjects associated
with the war effort.

With a seven to six majority in
Men’s council, Independent mem-
bers at a banquet—meeting Wednes-
day evening in the Royal York
apartments swept three of the four
elected executive offices and as an

T expression of their hoped for fu-

ture harmony granted to the fra-
ternities the treasurer’s position.

Arthur Thompson, C43, Inde-
.pendent, was elected president for
the coming year, which will in-
clude the summer session of the
council; Paul Pﬁschner, C44, In-
dependent, was elected vice-presi-
dent; Andrew Kramer, Ed43, In-
dependent, secretary; and Dave
Truan, BA44, treasurer. B

Because of the band concert, Wil-
liam Saalbach, E43, and Pﬁschner,
both band members, voted by proxy.

After the election which follow-
ed a general discussion, president-
elect Thompson- said that this year

. ‘Men’s council will function all dur-
ing the year and that closer atten-
tion to the constitutional laws will
be observed. He said:

“There is a clause in the by-laws
of the constitution which states
that absence—of any member from
two consecutive . meetings is
grounds for hi-s dismissal. This
year this ruling will be strictly en-
forced."

At a caucus meeting held Wed-
nesday, Independent members
unanimously elected James Rial,
E43, as their candidate for the
presidentcy. Rial, however, declin-

, ed the nomination -‘because of his
many duties as president of the
YMCA. Upon his refusal to run,
Thompson was selected.

As determined by the general
election April 8. the Independent
majority was eight to ﬁve, but the
difference was recently when Ar-
thur Clarke, E44, pledged Delta

Syphilis Tests
Not Offered
For This Year

Dr. Clifford Carlson, director of
the Men’s Student Health Service,
announced today that the annual
Wasserman tests will not be con-
ducted this year at the University.

Because just as many students
have been given the Wasserman test
during the recent blood bank drive
as are normally tested during the
Wasserman campaigns, he said that
the ﬁeld has been fairly well cov-
ered and the additional expenses
can be avoided.

Although the local blood bank
drive has closed, students who wish
to volunteer their pint of blood may
do so at the Wabash building down-
town.’ *

Higbee, Chicks
Given Review p

In PM Weekly

By PAT MONTGOMERY

After PM._ took 60 different pho-
tos of Dr. Edna Higbee, instructor
in biology she wouldn’t have been
surprised to see a whole picture
section devoted to herself-

Dr. Higbee is well known for
her experiments with increasing
the growth and maturation of baby
chicks by the injection of colchi-_
cine. Consequently she's used to
publicity and she posed obligingly.
After about 40 photos even her
chicks began to become photogeni-
cally minded. Knowing the ways of
publications she wasn't surprised

when nothing appeared for s. time .

afterward.

Finally she received a phone call
from the young photographer. He
raved about the lovely picture of
her they were printing with the
article about her experiments, and
said that it would appear in. the
April 12th “Weekly Magazine.”

The magazine came out and the
one picture of her was surrounded
by huge pictures of her photogenic
chickens. '

When asked about the picture
chosen from the 60, Dr. Higbee
chuckled, “Not even my chickens
recognized me.”

All students who expect to en-
roll for student teaching the first
or second semester, 1942-43,
will meet Monday at 2:30 o'clock
in 244 Cathedral.

SFA To Nleet Wednesday;  
A/lust Break Deadlock *

By IRV LEIBER H
With all members agreeing that

some definite and satisfactory ac-
tion should be taken as soon as pos-
sible to break the 16-16 deadlock,
the executive committee yesterday

called a SFA meeting for Wednes-
day at 7:45 o’clock in the Men’s
Lounge. .

The seven faculty members who
still retain their vote and who
could not attend the last scheduled
SFA meeting will probably be on
hand to either advise the assembly
on how the deadlock can be brok-
en without their interference or to
use their right to vote and break
the 16-16 deadlock.

Any way you look at the present
set-up the faculty members are on
the spot. The power of the faculty
members’ vote can very easily
break the deadlock, but the faculty
in doing so will be deciding an is-
sue which primarily is one for the
student members to decide.

However, it does not look like
either the Independents or the Fra-
ternity representatives will yield to
the demands of each other. -

perform any duty assigned to him.

Since the compilation of the
questionnaires, several requests
have been ﬁlled. Among them 
one for engineering students to
serve as ﬁre-ﬁghters, and others
for students interestedin ﬁrst aid.
About 500 students have already
received ﬁrst aid training. S‘

The largest list of names is that
of persons interested in ﬁrst aid,
including; faculty members, boy
scouts and girl scouts who have had

training, persons qualiﬁed to teach I
ﬁrst aid, and all others who would
be interested in joining ﬁrst aid
training courses.

Beside the list of those in first
aid, are other lists of persons who
either signified an interest or pos-
sessed qualifications. for ﬁre-ﬁghb
ing, ambulance service, guides and
messengers, and bomb squads, of
which several have been formed
and trained. ‘

As the University begins the ac-
tual work of air raid defense, calls
are expected to come in for black-'’ ,
out aides, and for traffic managers
whose job will be to direct students S
to those.parts of the building which
are safest, and to keep the base-
ment and elevator clear for the"
wounded during any emergency.

Other ﬁles have been compiled"
of auxiliary nurse bandage makers,
rescue squads,‘ and clinical work- 
ers. At present, Dr. lsaacs is re- if B
checking the ﬁles to remove the —
names of the seniors who just grad- "

uated.

In making these records, Dr, r
Isaacs has also listed all the regu-
lar workers on every ﬂoor of all
the Unlversity buildings who would i‘
be available immediately to ban.

burg this weekend with the fervent hope of making it four in

a row and avenging the opening game defeat handed them by

Buckn-ell. ‘

“Fourteen players will be included in the squad that will

leave this afternoon for Bucknell. Those making the trip will
be inﬁelders, Brown, Kostenbauder, Fisher, and tA1corn_who
apparently has won the third base spot from Fred Wilner.

Icardi, Feldstein, Wilk, Jacobs, and
Vaiksnor will compose the outﬁeld

crew,e and Mitterling will take-

pitchers McKee, Vitunac, Egan, and-
Ranii. Eugene Zukes will be the
only catcher included in the squad.

Mel Ranii, who started the open-
ing game and _who,has not pitched
since, is favored to start for the
Panthers on Saturday. ,
lTh"e Panther "squad,lwhich in the

mainis made up of inexperienced
sophomores, can be pardoned for
being elated over their recent show-
ings. By defeating.West Virginia,
6-4, on Tuesday they swept the two
game series and ran their win
streak up to three. Once again time-
ly hitting and pitching combined
to give them victory.

Jim Egan who prior to Tues-
day's game had-neverdpitched a
ball anywhere but i_nto_a basket,
did a ﬁne job up to the eighth in-
ning when Bill McKee was sent in
to relieve him after West Virginia
hand bunched four hits to produce
three runs. McKee was in several
tough spots and on two occasions

had men on second and third with
two outs, but he had what it took
in the clutch and on both occa-
sions escaped without any runs be-
ing scored. in addition he chipped
in with a triple, and a single.

Johnny Brown continued his bat-
ting spree by knocking out_ three
hits in ﬁve trips to the plate. Joe
Wilk faltered somewhat and only

got one hit in four times at bat.-

Incidentally, while the Pirates
may not know it they were respon-
sible for an unexpected -patriotic
ceremony before Tuesday's,-iigame.

“One fan who liked his baseball any"

‘way he could get it had brought
along _a portable radio. He tuned in
the Pirate-Phil game just as they
had begun to play the Star Spran-
gled Banner. » .

For a moment no one knew what
to do. Then a few fans stood up.
Then the West Virginia team stood
up. Then the Pitt team stood up,
and with heads bowed, and caps
held over their hearts all stoor at
attention until the last strains of
the music died away.
