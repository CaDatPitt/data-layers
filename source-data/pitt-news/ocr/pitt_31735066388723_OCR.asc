UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Universities prepare for National Condom Week

By Jonathan Berr
Staff Writer

Over 150 universities across
the country are planning obser-
vances of one type or another for
this year's National Condom
Week, scheduled Feb. 14 to 21.

National Condom Week is a
joint effort of the Pharmacist’s
Planning Services, |nc.; Carter
Wallace, manufacturers of Trojan
Condoms; and Mayer Laborato-
ries, makers of Kimmono con-
doms, to promote the use of
condoms among the sexually ac-
tive population.

This year's official insignia for
Condom Week consists of a line
of dancing condoms complete
with top hats.

One of the events included in

Condom week is a National Con-
dom Couplet Contest, which
awards ”a valuable prize” for the
best ”rubber rhyme”. Some of
the sample couplets given in the
National Condom Week
brochure include, ”When you
rise  Condomize" and ”Send a
rubber to your lover.”

Karen Hughy, National Coordi-
nator for National Condom Week
said their goal is to reduce the
cases of sexually transmitted dis-
eases (STDs) including AIDS, and
unwanted pregnancies.

NCW started at the University
of California at Berkeley in 1978,
when Frederick Mayer, president
of the Pharmacist’s Planning Serv-
ices, Inc. handed out condoms at
Union Square on campus.

than, a junior political science
major and president of Berkeley's
Students for Preventative Health,
is coordinating a celebration of
NCW at Berkeley.

NCW events scheduled at Ber-
keley are titled ”The Dicatha-
|on”. Some events include: a
condom-blowing contest, the
water-filling condom competi-
tion, pin the condom on the man,
a condom trivia match, a preg-
nant man pageant and the put the
condom on the cucumber
contest.

Mayer said that the condom on
the cucumber contest requires its
contestants to split up into male-
female teams. ’’It is a totally open
contest. It is not important who
holds the cucumber. There are no
rules. We want it done srnoothly

as long as it works.”

The Univerity of Pittsburgh is
planning a low—key observation
of National Condom Week, said
Janet Devoe, a Nurse Health Edu-
cator with the Student Health
Service. ”One week a year is not
enough," said Devoe.

Devoe said that the reliability
of condoms is close to 100 per-
cent effective if they are used in
the correct manner.

Devoe said the most effective
condoms are the latex condoms
which are lubricated and contain
the spermicide non-oxul nine.
"Condoms made in the United
States have to undergo strict qual-
ity control,” she said.

Throughout the week, the Stu-
dent Health Service will be man-
ning a booth in the Towers Lobby

Students
compete
in comic
contest

By Scot Ross
Staff Writer

Quips, quotes, questions,
answers, anecdotes, applause,
guffaws. These were just a few
of the elements tossed around
at the Pittsburgh leg of the U.S.
College Comedy Competition,
held Thursday, Feb. 11 in
David Lawrence Auditorium.

Sponsored by Sticklets
Natural Flavor Gum and Dori-
tos brand Cool Ranch tortilla
chips and hosted by the Pitt
Panhellenics, the program was
part of a nationwide,
100—college search to find
America’s best college stand-
up comedian.

The rules require each bud-
ding comic to perform no
more than a three-minute rou-
tine to be video-taped and
reviewed by national judges,
comedians Gilbert Gottfried
and Larry ”Bud” Melman.

Of the 2,000 students cross-
country expected to enter, four
finalists will be chosen and
flown to Daytona Beach, Fla.
from March 21 through 25 to
compete in the finals for the
right to be crowned ”The Fun-
niest College Comedian.”

The grand prize winner will
receive an all-expense paid
five-day, four-night trip for two
to New York, including a VIP
tour of comedy clubs, dinner
at the Hard Rock Cafe and an
appearance at the Comedy
Strip.

I-debut’: Sindlt::rr’The- Pitt Ni

Professional comedian, Judd Apatow hosted the U.S. College Comedy Competition last week

in David Lawrence Hall-

U.S. Concepts, Inc. is
producing the entire competi-
tion, and President Brian Mur-
phy believes, ”The College
Comedy Competition gives
grass-roots comedians on cam-
puses all over the country a
unique opportunity to be dis-
covered at their own school
and nationally. And it's a great
way for [Sticklets and Doritos]
to reach students — through
their stomachs and funny
bones.”

According to Panhellenic
president Michele Jedlica,
Panhel offered to help be-
cause, ”We wanted to do
something that opened up to

the entire campus. It concen-
trates on students as opposed
to just the Greeks.”

Doritos and Sticklets offset
all the costs of the production.
They also passed out free sam-
ples throughout the campus.

In addition, the companies
are holding another contest
whereby the college that col-
lects the most Doritos and
Sticklets wrappers wins a
comedy concert with Gilbert
and Larry ”Bud”.

Jedlica said Panhel spent no
money on the show. ”We
were just a group to help bring
it on campus.”

Five aspiring jokesters

represented Pitt in the tourna-
ment: they included Henry
Lerner, Mindy Aronson, Ge-
orge Bellios, Mark Staff and
Keith Leslie.

Master of Ceremonies was
professional comedian Judd
Apatow, formerly of New York
and currently performing on
the college tour.

Apatow, who has performed
at the Improvisation, as well as
the Comic Strip and Danger-
field's, explained that half of
the colleges in the competition
are from the East Coast, and
half are on the West. .

He also said that of the

and will be handing out informa-
tion about condoms and coupons
for condoms. The Student Health
Service sells condoms at a dis-
count price on a regular basis.

Kent Baldauf, president protern
of the Student Government Board
and Chuck Farinella, President of
the lnterfraternity Council both
said they weren't aware of Na-
tional Condom Week.

Gianfranco Chicco, a spokes-
man for Carter-Wallace said,
”The goals of National Condom
Week and those of our company
are the same."

Chicco said that last year there
were over 360 million condoms
sold in this country for a total re-
tail sales of $200 million.

Roots of
racism
addressed
at lecture

By Keri D. Smith
Staff Writer

Dr. Charles H. King Jr. deli-
vered a lecture entitled, ”How
Racist Are You?” that included
demonstrations of racism in our
society to an audience in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union on Thursday
night.

King, founder of the Urban Cri-
sis Center Inc. in Atlanta, Ga.,
spoke in honor of Black History
Month.

Monique Sims, chairperson of
Pitt's Black Action Society, said
"the reason that it [King's lecture]
relates to Black History Month is
because, unfortunately, [racism]
is a part of our history, not only
by whites but by a wide range.”

King leads racial awareness
and sensitivity seminars through-
out the country to promote
affirmative action. His lectures in-
clude simulations of real—life rac-
ist incidents with white and black
members of his audience.

According to King, the problem
with racism is that blacks and
whites cannot admit that there is
a problem.

”The first problem we face,” he
said, ”is people will not ac-
knowledge the problem between
black people and white people.
The cause of the problem is white
people and white racism.”

King added that whites are
prejudiced because of condition-
ing by family, teachers and
friends. Blacks, however, are

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, February T5, T988

New changes on horizon for Soviet government

MOSCOW Communist
Party activists proposed in an ar-
ticle on the front page of Pravda
on Sunday that more than one
candidate be ptrt forward for top
party posts and that all party
meml)ers be allowed to vote.

The stiggestions, appearing in
the party’s main newspaper,
came from party activists in the
Ukraine.

Althotigh the proposals do not
have the party's formal approval,
their appearance on Pravc/a’s
front page indicated the leacler—
ship is seriously considering
them.

The article said the issue would
be formally taken up at the l9th
All-Union Party Conference, a
rare gathering of the nation's
Communists to be held June 28
in Moscow.

Soviet leader Mikhail S. (lor-
bachev has said electoral reform
will be a key topic at the confer-
ence. He has talked about many
of the same siiggestions printed
in Pravda, beginning at a plenary
meeting of the party's Central
Committee in January 1986.

Vranitzky may resign
over Waldheim furor

VIENNA, Atistria -— Socialist
(Thancellor Franz Vranit/ky said
Sunday he would consider
resigning if the controversy over
President Ktirt Waldheim’s World
W/ar ll conduct continues to hani—
per Vranitzky’s leadership.

About 5,()()() people, including
actor Klaus Maria Branclauer,
gathered in central Vienna out-
side the landmark St. Stephen’s
Cathedral to c all for Walclheim’.s
ouster.

Abotit half of them marched to
the Hofburg Palace, site of the
president’s office, and chanted,
"Waldheim must go!"

In an hour-long television iiiter—
view, Vraiiit/ky, who heads a
coalition goyeriimeiit, launched
a sharp attack on Waldheim,
whose duties as head of state are
mostly ceremonial.

The president "did not deal ex-
actly with the truth” during the
investigation into his activities as
a soldier in the Nazi army,
Vranit/ky said. He stopped short,

however, of urging Waldheim to
step down.

Veteran political observers did
not recall a similar public: con-
frontation between a chancellor
and a president since the second
Austrian republic was established
after World War It.

South Koreans protest

”suppression” of labor

SE()Ul_, South Korea —- About
%()() people marched through
downtown Seoul Sunday to pro-
test what they said was govern-
ment suppression of labor
movements and U.S. pressure to
open South Korea's restricted
market.

Police took away about fit)
people for defying an order to (lis-
perse near the headquarters of the
governing Democratic Justice
Party. They didn't say if charges
would be filed.

Demonstrators shouted ’’Out

with Rob Tae—woo!” and ”The
United States, stop unfair eco-
nomic pressure!”

U.S. officials are asking South
Korea to reduce its growing trade
surplus by allowing more imports
of foreign cigarettes, beef and
other agricultural products.

South Korea ran up a trade stir-
plus of $9.3 billion with the Uiiit—
ed States last year.

Rob was elected president on
Dec. l6.

Baby M
discussed
at Law
seminar  

By Mark R. Brown

Staff Writer

Edward O'Donnell, the
New Jersey attorney who re-
cently lost the famous Baby M
surrogate custody case, spoke
Saturday at the Pitt Law
School

Sponsored by the Women's
Law Caucus, the fourth annu-
al Marjorie Matson Law Semi-
nar focused on reproductive
rights and issues.

O'Donnell, a lawyer
specializing in divorce and
custody cases, was in the na-
tional spotlight for his han-
dling of the Stern couple in
their effort to gain custody of
Melissa Stern from her sur-
rogate mother, Mary Beth
Whitehead.

According to O'Donnell,
”Statistics show a three-fold in-
crease in infertility in the last
20 years. It's an epidemic in
infertility.

"it seems that New Jersey
law has a narrow view of

procreation,” O'Donnell
added.
O'Donnell discussed the

rights of the surrogate mother
as well as the rights of the
child, which "  transcends
all other considerations. The
child's rights are paramount."
O'Donnell also said that,
"There has always been and
always will be a black market
and grey market for babies.
Stringent guidelines should
regulate the issue of surrogacy.
”The New Jersey law says
’no’ to pre-birth surrender
agreements, whereas the Ken-
tucky and New York decisions
are overbroad," he said.
"My mother didn't want me.
Other mommies didn't give up
their kids. Why me?” said
Cyril Means, a law professor
from New York University.
”Does the l3th Amendment
apply here or not? A genera-
tion of surrogate children may
have higher incidences of drug
use or other problems when
they learn that they were sold
for profit," said Means.

Dr. Charles King spoke on racism in today's society last week in the William

prejudiced only because of
hostile encounters with a
prejudiced white society.

"We are all prejudiced.
Piejudice is not a negative thing,
it's prejudgement. it's how you
feel, not what you do. Prejudice
only becomes wrong when you
misuse it," King said.

"Even though a lot of people
say racism went away with the
Jim Crow Laws, it hasn't," said
Simms. _

King explained that many black
youths fall out of schools and col-
leges because of oppression by
teachers. To demonstrate this to
the audience, King asked for a
white male volunteer, Chris Gal-
vin, to go before the audience
an(l kneel in front of King with a
cup on his head and one arm out-
stretched. King explained to the
audience that Galvin would feel
dumb, humiliated and would not
remember what he was about to
ask of him.

King asked Galvin to sing "The
Star—Spangled Banner." Later,

One of the biggest problems
he has witnessed is a lack of

.Condom use week

starts amid fanfare

This week is a time for celebration. It is the National Week
of the Condom, the days of ”li’l rubber sheaths” for the John
Thomas’ of the country. ”Wrap that Rascal,” a T-shirt adver-
tised in Rolling Stone suggests.

At the University of Berkeley, a ”pin the condom on the man”
contest is being planned. Other schools are giving thousands
of condoms, some with instructions, to their students. In case
anyone was wondering, the most commonly purchased type
of condom is the lubricated variety with the reservoir tip, and
women buy about half of the condoms sold in this country,
according to a USA Today report.

There seems to be a lighthearted approach to the condom,
and by implication, to the once taboo topic of birth control.
Virginia Slim cigarettes tells women that they have ”come a
long way, baby.” Perhaps the same could be said of the entire
country. With the recent rise in fatal sexually transmitted dis-
eases, the game of ”pin the condom on the man” could take
on a significance beyond that of a fun party diversion.

Noriega lives past
his usefulness here

Increasingly, Panamanian General Manuel Antonio Noriega
is coming under fire in the United States for his part in drug
cartels smuggling cocaine and marijuana across American bord-
ers. Other charges against him include facilitating the training
of contra rebels for the United States when such aid was banned
here and money laundering.

After the indictment was handed down from the Justice
Department, it was learned by The Washington Post, among
other papers, that there had long been evidence of Noriega’s
participation in drug smuggling, but that his value to the CIA
as an informant and a partner caused some of that information
to be supressed.

In a blazing battle between the State Department, the Justice
Department and the various intelligence agencies, Noriega has
been fought over like a piece of meat thrown to a starving dog
team. There has been some speculation that Noriega has out-
lived his usefulness to the CIA because his cover has been blown
in the contra war.

Panama does not have an extradition agreement with the Unit-
ed States, and the Panamanian government has accused
Washington of trying to upset a sovereign government.

Whatever the outcome of this latest spectacle of governmental
oversight, one thing will be clear. As long as the various govern-
ment agencies are working with conflicting agendas, the pub-
lic can expect more of the same. Much more.

In a nutshell 

 we have to change our civilization and
come to terms with this obsession with vio-
lence that now characterizes civilization.

— Al Gore, presidential candidate (from a
U.S. News and World Report interview)

Muslims are being harassed

Israel is in jeopardy. This is be-
cause they shoot Muslims. Mus-
lims are denied legal status in
Israel. No new mosques are built.
The Muslims are granted little or
no representation in the Krfesset.
America funds this religious ex-
clusion. No one knows exactly
why, except that Israel is pre-
sumed loyal to America. So loy-
al, in fact, that they will help us
sell missiles to the Ayatollah
Khomeini.

The Muslim culture is not in-
herently vicious or anti—Israe|.
There are few aspects about Is-
lamic philosophy that a pragmat-
ic atheist would like, but, for a
strict rationalist, Judaism and
Christianity are equally absurd.
The point is that even absurd peo
ple should not be denied legal
status, and if they are going to be,
there's no good reason to deny it
only to Muslims. Besides, every
religion has its flavors, its special
poems, its prayers, and the mys-
tery of life is something no atheist
can explain. So religion isn't all
that absurd, anyway; it just isn't
a matter for exclusion from
representation and legal rights. ,

As for Palestinian riots:

How far

I feel tompelled to take issue
with [TI irsday’s, Feb. 11] letter
praising the Sandinista govern-
ment as an instrument of progres-
sive reform. Somehow I fail to see
the forced resettlement of
Nicaragua’s Miskito Indians as
”progressive reform." The San-
dinistas have also forbidden the
existence of labor unions which
are critical of their policies. This
move is inconsistent with the
”progressive reforms” which the
Nicaraguan government has sup-
posedly implemented. The clos-
ing of opposition newspaper La
Prensa is a blatent violation of
freedom of expression.

The author of [Thursday's] let-
ter also stated that the Sandinis-
tas are not communists. I find this
hard to believe, given the large
number of Cuban, East German
and Soviet military advisors in

your friends were treated as in-
feriors by the legal system? Isn't
it a bit preposterous that Muslims
shouIdn’t demand a government
which doesn't discriminate
against them? Israel fears Muslims
because many Muslim countries
don't recognize their right to ex-
ist. They don't need Muslim ap-
proval to exist, but they do need
a humane legal system for legiti-
mate American approval. Such
legitimacy will persuade many
Muslims.

The Muslim culture is not
about stockings over the head
and pistol-wielding murderers.
That perception is the result of

terrorist—mongering. The Muslim
culture is no more inherently ter-
rorist than the American culture
is inherently The Texas Chain
Saw Massacre.

Muslim culture is the search for
freedom from lies, and the search
for holiness. The doctrines are not
all benign, but the mystical quest
is no grounds for total ridicule.
The practice of religion is certain-
ly no excuse for exclusion from
government or sympathy. As with
any culture, the more Muslims
receive proper nourishment, the
healthier they will grow to
become.

The Israeli-Arab entanglement
is often excused away as some-
how based on the ”historic ani-
mosity” of the Arabs for the Jews,
or the Jews for the Arabs. Indeed,
the biblical origin of the two
semitic peoples is not that love-
ly. There is, however, no histor-
ic animosity which cannot be
overcome with dignity and a lit-
tle bit of luck. Americans stand-
ing tall will not really solve the
problem, and neither will an ls-
raeli solution of death.

Nicaragua. According to a recent
State Department estimate, there
are 3,000 military advisors from
Eastern Bloc countries in
Nicaragua. The presence of Bul-
garian economic advisors and the
supression of private enterprise in
Nicaragua seems to suggest that
the Sandinistas, if not com-
munists, are hardly Adam
Smith/Iassez faire capitalists.

Given the ongoing civil war in
Nicaragua, one may deem the
oppressive domestic measures
which the Sandinistas have im-
plemented as necessary for na-
tional security. However, those
who are constantly making this
argument, including Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega, are ig-

noring the events prior to 1981,
when the contra war began.

From the time the FSLN came
to power in 1979 until 1981, the
Sandinista regime consolidated
its power under the rubric of
Marxism/Leninism. This meant
the suspension of elections until
1984, increased media censor-
ship and tight-fisted control over
Nicaragua’s economy.

These events, and not necessar-
ily intervention by Ronald Rea-
gan, are the reasons for the
existence of the contras. While
the "freedom fighters” are not ex-
actly Ted Kennedy Democrats
themselves, their continued exis-
tence will force President Ortega
to make true the progressive re-
forms of which the author of
[Thursday's] paean spoke.

Husband worried about AIDS

Q: While I was out of the coun-
try, I went to a fabulous brothel,
famous around the world, and
fell for those old ”when in Rome
do as the Romans” and ”I
deserve this experience once”
fallacies. I went to the brothel as
a tourist, just to see the place and
have a drink or two, but I left as
a trick with a case of gonorrhea.

The drinks helped my fall from
good sense. So I caught a dose
and stayed some extra days over-
seas getting it cleared up. Now I
am worried about having risked
exposure to the AIDS virus and
have not had sex with my wife
‘since coming home. She has the
situation figured out, although I
have admitted nothing.

I see what has to be done. I
have to tell her the truth. So
please tell me how to take the
first step with some kind ofstyle,
or at least without covering my-
self with a fake look of remorse

I-------I
DR. R|l'I'l-I
WESTHEIMER

I don’t really feel.

A: I think you really do feel
some remorse or regret, or you
wouldn't be worrying at all. And
let me say that some regret, at
least let us call it regret, is certain-
ly the right thing to have. Because
the situation is definitely regret-
table. For you to have this loss of
frankness with your wife, this fear
of having been exposed, this fear
of passing something fatal on to
her, is regrettable. And obvious-
ly you do regret it, because those
few drinks you had did not make
a permanent idiot out of you.

When we have the good sense
to regret something, at least let us
not regret having good sense.

In the past I have often told
people not to burden their

spouses with unwanted confes-
sions. If a husband or wife
slipped from fidelity and felt
guilty, that was no reason to give
this unwelcome and pain—giving
news to the faithful one, the de-
ceived one. But in the present
era, any infidelity puts the spouse
who was unfaithful and the inno-
cent one in grave danger. So you
have to say you got drunk, the ex-
otic place and the drinks over-
came your good sense, and now
you are sober, pretty frightened,
and very, very sorry.

Your wife will not doubt that
you are serious. It is a very seri-
ous dilemma you are in, and if
you are worried about what kind
of style you show, then you are
worried about the wrong thing.
You just have to realize how seri-
ous this is, and act seriously.

You definitely have to see a
doctor to have the test for the
AIDS virus antigen.

straight title

By Kelly Witt
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s and women's
swim teams captured their sixth
consecutive Big East titles this
weekend at Trees’ pool.

’’I was really happy to see the
team pull together like they did.
It was a team effort and everyone
contributed. We were still a little
tired from not tapering fully, but
all in all, we swam well,” said
senior Geoff Rife.

Rife put in a strong perfor-
mance in the 1650-yard freestyle.
However, teammate Charlie Fry
won the event, breaking the
record he set last year, with a
time of 15:34.70.

Senior co-captain Chuck Lersch
took second, and Rob Monte
took third. Junior Dan Langan
came in fourth. ”l’m just really
happy with my performance and
I hope to do well at Easterns,”
sdl(l Langan.

Lersch took first place in the
30()-yard freestyle with a time of
-l:.%().5.%. Fry took second place.
Monte and Rife came in fifth and
slXll1, respectively.

Senior co-captain Jim Emore
won the 200—yard individual
medley with a time of 1:55.99.

Emore was joined by team-
mates Tim Adams, Mark Dom-
broski, and Bill Folger to make up
the winning 400-yard Medley re-
lay team. They had a time of
3:25.09.

Emore came in second in the
10()-yard buttterfly with a time of
50.09. Teammate John Kesler
came in third with a 51.66.

Adams placed third in the
50-yard freestyle, with teammates
Scott Jeffries and Folger taking
fourth and fifth.

In the 100-yard freestyle
Adams, Folger, and Jeffries came
in second, third, and fourth.

Dombroski won the 100-yard
breastroke and the 200-yard
breastroke. ‘'1 expected to win
both events. David Buyze of Syra-
cuse beat me last year in the 200.
I beat him this year. it's personal-
ly satisfying,” said Dombroski.

Teammate Matt Weist came in
third in the 100-yard breastroke
and second in the 200.

I wanted to beat David Buyze.

Panthers shake off Wildcats, sta

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

The Villanova Wildcats were
poised to take away first place in
the Big East. The Pitt Panthers
wanted to keep it. Something had
to give.

Pitt was able to hold off the
Wildcats for an 87-75 victory.

”They [Villanova] had us a lit-
tle confused with their changing
defenses,” Pitt guard Jason Mat-
thews said. ’’It looked like they
were in a triangle and two, a box
and one, or a matchup zone, so

goal of mine and a goal of Mark's
(Dombroski),” said Weist.

”Matt’s come a long way, he's
improving a |ot,”said men's head
coach Dick Bradshaw.

The 800-yard relay team of
Lersch, Folger, Fry and, Adams
won with a time of 6:53.04.

Adams also placed second in
the 100—yard backstroke. Emore
came in fourth.

Lersch came in second in the
200—yard freestyle and Folger
came in third. Sprinter Scott
Jeffries put forth a super effort and
won the consolation heat.

‘'1 was really happy," said
Lersch. ’’It was the best Big East
of my life. it ended my swimming
here great, just like I wanted to.”

” We anticipated it to be a very
tough meet. Villanova has proved
to be tough in dual meets. It was
a total team effort,” said
Bradshaw.

”The men’s Eastern Seaboard
championships will be held at
Brown University in three weeks.

Pitt's Chris Blair was named
(liver of the meet. Blair came in
second on the 1—meter board and
first on the 3-meter. The compe-
tition for diver of the meet was so
(‘lose that the judges had to go to
point differences, which made
Blair the winner by 0.55 of a
point.

”l'm relieved more than any-
thing else. He (Villanova’s Dave
Echeverria) came a long way
from last year. I didn't expect him
to dive this well. He did a good
job,” said Blair.

Vernon Yenick came in third
on the 3—meter board. Freshman
Eric Homer placed sixth in what
diving coach Julian Krug called a
”surprise performance”.

’’I wasn't picked to be in the
top six. I'm really happy with
it,”said Horner.

Tricia Ney was named wom-
en's diver of the meet. Ney won
both the 1-meter and 3-meter
competitions. ”By breaking the
record on the 1—meter board,
Tricia became the best woman
diver ever to compete at Pitt. She
now holds the team records and
the pool records,” said women's
coach David Belowich.

”Overall, the divers did a
whale of a job," said Krug. ”Ca-
thy Sistek did a great Job in tak-

we had a little trouble with that
in the beginning of the game.
Once we figured out their
defense, we didn't have much of
a problem.”

The win put the Panthers
(ranked number 5 by the As-
sociated Press) at 17-3 overall,
and 7-2 in the Big East. Villano-
va falls to 16-8, 8-4 in the league.

”The team came back well
against a very hostile crowd,” Pitt
coach Paul Evans said. ”We got

game, and the defense was a
whole lot better.”

Villanova’s Mark Plansky led
all scorers with 27 points. Lane
led the Panther attack with 24.

Lane topped the Panthers with
13 rebounds, and Plansky led the
Wildcats with seven.

Pitt's season has run in cycles.
It seems that a loss riles up the
Panthers.

After losing their first game of
the year at Georgetown, they
were able to come back and
shoot down St. John's, 81-70.

A loss to Oklahoma was a
warning sign to Providence. Pitt

sent them crashing down, 90-56.

After Syracuse was able to
hand Pitt its first home loss of the
season last week, it was the Wild-
cats’ turn to fall.

”Once you get that loss it's like
you have to start all over again,"
Smith said. ”You just come out
and play. There is no pressure,
you just play ball."

Lane seems to be the catalyst
behind this improved play. Fol-
lowing Georgetown, he put in 19
points and had 15 rebounds. Af-
ter Oklahoma, he led the team
with 17 points and 17 rebounds.
He seems to explode after a loss.

y in first

"I don't think it has to do with
maturing as a team,” Lane said.
"It's just a sign that we weren't
playing together as a team one
game and other games we were
playing as a team. When we play
as a team hardly anybody can
stop us.”

‘'1 think it shows our ability to
bounce back,” Matthews said.
”When we lose a game, we ar-
en’t really down. We are upset
that we lost, and we come back
the next game and play harder."

Senior Judy Haughton won the
2()0—yard butterfly, becoming the
third person in Big East history to
win an event four years in a row.
Freshman Kara Moxie came in
fifth, and Rachelle Stauffer came
in seventh. Michelle Ranck had
a lifetime best performance. ’’It
was my last meet. It was really
nice to see the teams pull
together like they did. It was great
winning the sixth Big East in a
row. i was pleased with the way
I swam. It was a great way to fin-
ish my swimming career,” said
Ranck.

Haughton placed third in the
100-yard butterfly, eighth in the
individual medley, and was a
member of the 200- and 400-yard
medley relays.

Sandy Albright, Maureen
Cleary and Celeste Makiel joined
Haughton in the 400—yard med-
ley relay.

Makiel won the 500-yard
freestyle with a time of 5:01.99.

Marian Cassidy placed second,
with Theresa Picklo, Pat Rick-
ert,and Liz Sari taking fourth, fifth
and sixth, respectively.

’’I was just really happy that we
won. It feels great to be part of a
winning team,” said Makiel.

Cassidy won the. 400—yard in-
dividual medley. She was joined
by Makiel, Moxie, and Rickert in
the winning 800-yard freestyle re-
lay and by Makiel, Rickert, and
Cindy‘ Rose in the 400-yard relay.

”l was happy with my meet. It
was nice to swim well in my last
home meet,”said Cassidy. ’’It was
a lot tougher this year and we had
to swim harder and it meant
more.”

Most valuable swimmer of the
meet, Vi|lanova’s Laurel Fourni—
er won the 50-yard freestyle. Pitt's
Cindy Rose came in second.

”This is a good championship
in particular. It's a young team.
They have to realize that the most
important part of the team is the
team itself. They were excited,
swam very well, and were an im-
pressive team,”said Belowich.

a Pirate,
signs deal

(AP) — Pittsburgh Pirates
outfielder Andy Van Slyke has
signed a one-year contract, ac-
cording to team officials.

Van Slyke, 27, was acquired
by Pittsburgh in a four—player
deal with St. Louis on April 1.

Van Slyke batted .293 in
157 games at Pittsburgh. He
had 21 home runs, 82 runs
batted in and 34 stolen bases
in his first season with the
Pirates.

He set career highs in every
offensive category and led the
Pirates in nearly every offen-
sive department, team spokes-
man Greg lohnson said
Saturday night.

His signing leaves only one
Pirate eligible for arbitration,
first baseman Sid Bream, ata-
cording to lohnson.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, February l5, T988

The Pitt wrestling team
travelled to Penn State yester-
day, and came away with a

4 tough 28-16 loss.

It dropped the Panthers to
1-3 in the Eastern Wrestling
League. Penn State is 4-0 and
on top of the EWL.

”This was a tough one,” Pitt
head coach Rande Stottlemyer
said. ”Overall, the team wres-
tled hard, but we can't be
satisfied with just hanging
tough. I think that we easily
could have won this with
some extra effort.”

PSU got off to an 1 1-0 start
by taking the first three
matches. It was up to Pitt All-
American Pat Santoro to give
the Panthers a fighting chance.

Santoro responded by pin-
ning last weeks EWL wrestler
of the week Rob Meloy.

”Pat looked really good,”
Stottlemyer said. ”He knew
what he had to do, went out
and did it.”

A pivotal match was up next.

Wrestling team falls
to Penn State, 28-16

Pitt's Scott Hovan squared off
against Sean Finkbeiner, last
year's EWL champion.
Hovan held his own in a 7-7
tie.
”Scott is climbing the lad-

der,” Stottlemyer said. ’’Ear|i- '

er in the season, Finkbeiner
dominated Scott. Today
[yesterday], Scott was ready to
wrestle. It's not a win, but it
was a good match.”

Stottlemyer said that the
swing matches at 134 pounds
and heavyweight decided the
match.

”Some guys do what they
are supposed to do, but others
let down,” Stottlemyer said. ’’I
don't think it is too much to
ask.”

At 134 pounds, Pitt's Dave
Ciafre lost his fifth consecutive
one point match.

Pitt's lineup had a couple of
changes because of injuries.
Sean Moffit subbed for Matt
Gerhard at 126 pounds. Matt
Armour was at 177 pounds for
Mike Tongel. Both wrestlers
had to face the number one
wrestler in the country at their
weight classes.

Panther hockey club holds off
ex-rival Penn State-McKeesport

By John Labriola
Staff Writer

Pitt and Penn State have been
rivals for a long time. Their rival-
ry has the power to split a state
and to even split some
households.

This past Wednesday, this
traditional rivalry took on a rather
untraditional twist, when the
Saints from Penn State-
McKeesport played hosts to the
Pitt Hockey Club.

The Panthers left the Saints
praying after defeating them 6-4.

The Panthers opened the first
period with a terrific glove save
made by Chris Studebaker, fol-
lowed by a Panther goal scored
by Marc Bowers, assisted by Bri-
an Owens.

At 4:12, the Saints scored their
first goal off a rebounded save.

Panther Bill Ohnhouse put in
the Panthers’ second goal, only to
have it taken away by the referees
and a ”man in the crease” call.

With a minute remaining in the
first period, the Saints scored, fol-
lowed by a Panther goal by Craig
Clontz, assisted by Brian Woyt
and Eric Anderson.

The second period started with
two Panthers receiving penalties.
The first was Owens with a back-
checking penalty, followed short-
ly by Woyt with a tripping call.

Three minutes later, the Pan-
thers scored two consecutive
goals. The first came from Jim

Jacobs, assisted by John Carlins,
at 9:23. The second came from
Carlins, assisted by Woyt and
Jacobs, at 8:26.

The Saints retaliated with a goal
of their own.

At 2:37, Clontz scored to give
the Panthers a 5-2 lead over the
Saints. The Panthers then
received three consecutive penal-
ties —— a roughing call on Clontz,
a elbowing penalty on Bowers
and a roughing call on Owens.

Owens then received a 10-
minute misconduct call, while a
Saints player received only a two-
minute bench minor.

The Panthers, even playing
with three men in the box, were
able to keep the Saints from scor-
ing for the remainder of the sec-
ond period.

The third period opened with
three Panthers skating against six
Saints. After several attempts, the
Saints finally did manage to score
against the short—handed
Panthers.

The Saints followed their goal
with two penalties, both for
roughing.

With seven minutes remaining
in the third period, the Panthers
were hit with two more penalties.
Greg Rich earned a four—minute
double minor for roughing, and

Studebaker received a two-
minute roughing call.
With :32 left, Greg Wer-

chowski scored to close the scor-

ing at 6-4.

The game was called with eight
seconds remaining on the clock,
shortly after a fight broke out be-
tween Lance Riddle of the Saints
and Rich Schlesinger of the
Panthers.

Studebaker, the Panthers’
goaltender, summed up the entire
team's feelings. ”Today wasn't
easy. It was a real physical game.

”Our defense played real good.
When our defense plays good,
we win,” he added.

The Panthers are still holding
the No. 2 spot in the West Penn
College Hockey Association.
Gannon University still remains
undefeated and atop the
WPCHA. The Panthers are fol-
lowed by Penn State-McKeesport
and the Carnegie Mellon Tartans.

The Panthers’ current league
record is 8-3-2; their overall
record is 9-9-2.

The Panthers next game will be
against Allegheny College on
Saturday, Feb. 20 in Meadville.
Faceoff is at 4:30 p.m.

”We beat them 16-2 the last
time, and they only had seven
players. Now they have some
football players on the team. We
should have a good game," said
Rich, one of the Panthers’ assis-
tant captains.

’’It will be a long trip, and that
could be a big factor in how the
team will perform,” said Owens,
the Panthers’ captain.

l\/liller shows maturity
as season progresses

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

In the 198()’s, freshmen have
played a large role in the resur-
gence of Pitt basketball. Charles
Smith was voted Big East Fresh-
man of the Year in 1984. De-
metreus Gore, Michigan's Mr.
Basketball in 1983-84, came to
Pitt in that year, also starting ev-
ery game.

And Jerome Lane, a Parade All-
American from Akron, Ohio start-
ed sluggishly in his freshman year
but went on to become the na-
tion's leading rebounder as a
sophomore.

The three formed a cornerstone
for what has become one of the
most successful basketball pro-
grams in the country. 1987's
recruiting class will attest to that.

But forget about the past.
There's a new kid on the block
by the name of Sean Miller who
is redefining the term
”freshman.”

In his first year at Pitt, the-6-foot
Miller has become one of the
most reliable members of the
Panther squad. Averaging 1().2
points and nearly 5.5 assists per
game, Miller has established him-
self as one of the top point guards

in the rugged Big East conference.

The Blackhawk high school
graduate has been coming on
strong after a short mid-season
slump, dishing out 31 assists in
the past four games and scoring
a team high 18 points ir1 last
week's loss to Syracuse.

"1 think l’n1 getting a little bet-
ter,” Miller said. ’’I’m learning
the college game.”

Miller has had little trouble dur-
ing the transition period from
high school to Division-I basket-
ball. In his first collegiate game,
Miller was barking out plays and
orders like a seasoned veteran.
He came off the bench in the first
four games of the season and
took over the starting role against
West Virginia December 12th,
starting every game since.

Nearly everyone assumed
Miller would inherit the starting
spot when Mike Goodson was
declared ineligible during the fall
semester, but he apparently felt
more comfortable as the sixth
man.

Panther head coach Paul Evans
asked Miller if he would start
against Chicago State on Decem-
ber 7th, but Miller declined, say-
ing he wasn't ready to start.

(AP) —— Derrick Chievous has
spent much of this season being
mis-Chievous. But he turned his
mischief on No. 7 Nevada—Las
Vegas Saturday, and the result
was a victory for Missouri that
may put the Tigers back in the na-
tional rankings.

Chievous, benched by Coach
Norm Stewart for disciplinary rea-
sons at the start of five games this
season, had 26 points and held
UNLV gunner Gerald Paddio to
just 6 of 21 shooting as Missouri
beat the Runnnin’ Rebels 81-79.
It was just the third loss in 21
games for UNLV and just their
fourth home loss in five years at
the Thomas and Mack Center.

Maybe not, but he hasn’t dis-
appointed Evans or Pitt fans.

Miller's statistics are quite im-
pressive, particularly for a fresh-
man. He averages fewer
turnovers (46) than any other
Panther who plays at least 32
minutes a game.

Miller, a 1988 pre-season All-
Big East Freshman selection has
dished oIIt 109 assists this season,
a new Panther freshman record.
And he is currently in the midst
of a hot streak as he has hit 25
consecutive free-throws. The Pitt
record is 29 in a row, set by Ter-
ry Knight in 1978-79.

He has also hit 41 of 85 It-point
field goals this year and needs
only six more to move ahead of
former Panther (iurtis /\iken and
into first place on the .5-point
scoring list.

Miller's play has been a major
part of the fifth-ranked Panthers
7-2 record and first place stami-
ing in the Big East.

Pitt is 17-3 overall.

But Miller has not let the hype
surrounding his achievements af-
fect his game ,)erformance. ’’I’m
never satisfied,” Miller said. '’I
think when the season ends I still
won't be satisfied.”

But Evans is surely happy with
Miller's standout play. ”He’s
been very cfonsistent because his
shooting is back. People around
here think when he's not shoot-

ing, he's not having a great‘ game.
But he's had some great games
defensively and running this ball
club when he hasn't scored,"
Evans said.

I" resh off Saturday night's 87-73
Pitt victory at Villanova, coupled
with SyracI.Ise’s 61-59 loss to Ge-
orgetown this weekend, Miller is
optimistic about the rest of the
season. /\sked who the best team
in the Big East is, Miller said/“I
think we're it. If we win the next
two games, it's just nails in the
coffin."

Pitt plays at Providence Tues-
day night and faces (jeorgetown
in the Civic Arena at 2 p.m. Satur-
day, a game ( arried nationally by
CBS.

The freshman-who-doesn’t-
play-like-a-freshman has obvious‘-
ly accomplished quite a bit. But
he doesn't think he's done yet.
"The Final Four is the big thing,”
Miller said.

With Pitt’s talent, nothing’s im-
possible.

And with Miller's talent, the
same holds true. Don’t forget ~
Miller won’t be a freshman
forever.
