Associated Press Writer

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) - Vice
presidential candidates Dan
Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen
clashed Wednesday night in a
campaign debate, the youthful
Republican pronouncing himself
fully qualified for the high office
he seeks and his Democratic rival
saying there is no ”margin for er-
ror” in the White House.

Quayle played the role of ag-
gressor in the opening moments
of the debate, constantly turning
his answers into attacks on
Michael Dukakis even as he
defended his own readiness for
the vice presidency. ”|f qualifica-
tions alone are going to be the is-
sue in this campaign, George
Bush has more qualifications than
Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bent-
sen combined,” he said.

Bentsen, who has sharply ques-
tioned Qu-ayle’s maturity on the
campaign trail, said a vice presi-
dent must be prepared to take
over ”without any margin for
error.”

”The debate is about the

presidency itself,” he said. ”The
stakes could not be higher.”

Bentsen took aim at Bush,
recalling the vice president's vote
in favor of a budget plan to cur-
tail Social Security cost-of-living
increases.

The vice presidential rivals
shook hands and smiled as they
met at center stage for the begin-
ning of their 90-minute televised
debate.

The opening question came
from moderator Judy Woodruff,
who asked Quayle why he
thought he had not made a more
’’substantial impression” on fel-
low Republicans, some of whom
have openly criticized the Indi-
ana senator. The audience erupt-
ed into cheers and boos,
prompting Woodruff to appeal
for silence during the high-stakes
debate. _

But a few moments later, some
in the auditorium broke out into
derisive laughter when Quayle
strongly defended his voting
record on environmental issues.

Just as Quayle was asked to de-
fend his qualifications, Bentsen
was asked about his differences

Organization forms

to aid the

By Ugochi Oyoyo
Staff Writer

Written expressions of one’s
thoughts, feelings and other ideas
are a special form of human com-
munication. Unfortunately, not
all of us are participating in this
form of communication, for 26
million adults have not mastered
basic reading and writing skills,
while another 45 million are only
marginally competent in these
skills, reports the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education.

One Pitt student, Jay Katz, a
CAS senior studying English writ-
ing and sociology, spent the sum-
mer with the Greater Pittsburgh
Literacy Council, training as a tu-
tor for illiterate adults. During that
time, he decided to organize a
program that would allow college
students to get involved in the
battle against illiteracy.

’’I had been thinking about the
problem all along but didn't de-
cide to get active until after I saw
a campaign ad,” said Katz. ”I
knew there were many ads being
played on TV, but I don't watch
TV, and the ad that really got me
concerned was on the back of a
book!’

The GPLC, founded in 1976 by

illiterate

a group of volunteers, provides
instruction to the undereducated
adults of Allegheny County and
is cosponsoring the organization,
the Student Coalition for Literacy.

While Katz was planning the
student organization that would
address the need of illiterate
adults, Dr. Terrence Milani, as-
sociate director of Student Activi-
ties, sought to fulfill a broader
interest in establishing more stu-
dent service organizations on
campus.

”We happened to come
together at the right time,” said
Milani, ”and Jay called for a
meeting in which students would
talk about forming an organiza-
tion that serves as a vehicle for
students to get involved.”

This orientation meeting oc-
cured on Sept. 27 and involved
interaction between the students
and administrators present.

Katz said that ”in about a week
or two we should be more set-
tled, and possibly by December
we'll be certified.”

In the meantime, ”anybody
can apply to be a tutor  but
there definitely has to be an in-
terest and a strong sense of dedi-
cation,” said Veronica Schuder,
a CAS. freshman studying English

City celebrates Yugoslavian heritage

By Karen D. Speece

For The Pitt News

For the past 1 1 years, October
has been known by some as ”Yu-
goslavia in Pittsburgh” month.
The University of Pittsburgh and
several other cultural, education-
al and fraternal organizations
have come together to present a
variety of events in honor of this
occasion.

Steve Zupcic, chairman for
’’Yugoslavia in Pittsburgh”
month, said that ”various artistic
and cultural events related to var-
ious ethnic groups, such as the
Serbs, Slovakians and Croats” are
taking place.

Zupcic said, ”There’s a large
ethnic population in the Pitts-
burgh area. This is a way to coor-
dinate events for all of the
groups.”

The restaurant at the Radisson
Hotel in Monroeville is offering

Slovakian Cuisine Week. The
Slovakian style of food prepara-
tion is a blending of Slavic, Italian
and Austrian cooking methods.

Slovakian Cuisine Week at the
Radisson Hotel runs until Oct. 9,
frrm 5 to 10 p.m. every day.

"he Radisson is also holding an
exliibiton of paintings by Konrad
Peternelj, a Slovakian primitive
artist. Peternelj has held many ex-
hibitions in Slovenia, Frankfurt
and Vienna.

The University of Pittsburgh is
presenting a concert by the Yu-
goslavian pianist Aleksandra Ro-
manic. The concert will be held
on Friday, Oct. 14 at 8:30 p.m.
in the Frick Fine Arts auditorium.

According to Zupcic, Roman-
ic is ”one of the leading Yugo-
slavian pianists, and one of the
finest in the world.”

Romanic studied at Julliard in
New York and at the Moscow
Conservatory. She has performed

at such places as the Lincoln
Center in New York.

Romanic’s program will in-
clude works from Scarlatti,
Beethoven, Debussy and

Prokofiev. The university is offer-

ing complimentary admission to
all students.

On Wednesday, Nov. 2, En-
semble Mosa Pijade: The Zagreb
Jewish Choir will perform in the
Frick Fine Arts auditorium at 7:30
p.m.

The choir, which has 50 mem-
bers, will perform a combination
of Jewish and Slavic music, as
well as some classical pieces.

The concert is cosponsored by
the American Jewish Communi-
ty and the Croatian Fraternal
Union.

Lawsuit against CIA reaches tentative s

WASHINGTON (AP) —— The
government has tentatively set-
tled a lawsuit charging that the
CIA used nine Canadians as hu-
man guinea pigs in mind—control
research that included heavy
doses of LSD, lawyers in the case
said Wednesday.

The tentative out—of—court settle-
ment, negotiated by attorneys for
the Canadians and the Justice
Department, was announced on
the eve of trial at a hearing before
U.S. District Judge John Garrett
Penn, who has presided over the
case for eight years.

Neither side would discuss the

No assassination

policy contradicted

WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Reagan never signed intelli-
gence findings or documents
intended to authorize assassina-
tions by U.S. agents seeking to
combat terrorism, a White House
spokesman said today.

Such an authorization would
have been a direct contradiction
to an executive order that Reagan
signed in December, 1981 ex-
pressly prohibiting such murders,
said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.

But Fitzwater did say that there

8 Citizens’ lack of insurance told 2

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

For over a decade before his
wife's death, Sam LoFaso
faced enormous medical bills
due to her long series of ail-
ments. Despite his efforts to
get his wife the care she criti-
cally needed, she died.

”The expenses were un-
bearable, and l was forced to
declare bankruptcy,” he said.
”We lost our home and had to
move into a small apartment.
Everything just fell apart. We
didn't know how we were go-
ing to manage from day to
day/7

The same things exist for the
many Americans today who
find the cost of critical medi-
cal care insurmountable. in
fact, one out of every six
citizens in the United States
has no health insurance at all.

Debate on the issue of
universal health insurance has
been a central one in the up-
coming presidential election
and has caused concern
among many private citizens
throughout the United States.

Nine out of 10 Americans
believe everyone is entitled to
health care ”as good as a mil-
lionaire could get,” according
to a national poll conducted
by Louis Harris and As-
sociates.

This statistic, along with
others from polling organiza-
tions such as the Public Agen-

da Foundation and The Gallup

Organization, shows that a
great majority of citizens see
a need for bettering the avail-
ability of health care. Statis-
tics also show, however, that
many Americans are some-
what uncertain how to provide

health care certainty to the less‘

advantaged.

0 Some 74 percent of the
general public said they are
willing to see more spent on
health care.

0 When asked if they would
be willing to pay the taxes
necessary to support the catas-
trophic illness program, a pro-
gram designed to provide
health care to the needy, only
one in 10 said that they would
agree to a tax increase of about
$125 per year for this purpose.

0 A high proportion of peo-
ple (71 percent) believe that
health insurance should pay
for any treatment that-will save
lives even if it costs one mil-
lion dollars to save a life.

0 A large majority recognize
(by an 80 percent margin) that
the constant appearance of
new and very expensive ways
of treating the sick will soon
force harsh’ choices, making
universal health care unlikely.

0 The majority of Americans
believe that the quality of and
access to health care will suffer
if hospitals are forced to oper-
ate at a loss because of the
widening gap between Medi-
care payments and hospital
costs.

0 Three—quarters of those

surveyed believe private em-
ployers should be required to
provide health insurance to all
their employees.

0 Three—quarters of Ameri-
cans reported that they would
be less likely to vote for a po-
litical candidate if that candi-
date favored cuts in payments
for Medicare and Medicaid.

Governor Michael Dukakis
has vowed to change the fact
that the U.S. is the only’indus—
trialized country in the
Western world which does not
provide basic medical insur-
ance for all of its citizens, if he
is elected president in
November.

Dukakis promises to in-
troduce legislation requiring
employers to provide em-
ployee health benefits and
favors long—term care and
coverage for the currently
uninsured.

Vice President George Bush,
in alnationally televised de-
bate with Dukakis, stated that
he is against universal health
insurance. He argues that forc-
ing all employers to provide
health insurance to all their
employees would cause many
small businesses just getting
off the ground to fold. He said
that many companies simply
cannot afford it.

Bush has also said that he
would like to discourage
Medicare benefits being given
to those who may not need it.

writing.

At the orientation meeting, the
members of the organization said
that they needed students to sign
up as tutors and substitute tutors,
to interview students and adults
who would like to be tutored and
to distribute flyers and pamphlets
with more information.

Students who would like more
information or would like to offer
their time should either contact
Katz or leave a written message
in the Student Fiction and Poetry
Club mailbox located on the fifth
floor of the Student Union.

”The meeting was a nice suc-
cess,” said Donald Block, execu-
tive director of the GPLC.
”Fifty—two students showed up,
and we also presented informa-
tion about the the background of
the problem of illiteracy and
talked extensively about the op-
tions for student involvement.”

”There was an overwhelming
interest among the students, ad-
ministrators and organizations
present,” said Katz. Some of the
organizations that plan to be in-
volved with the organization,
which will be titled the Student
Coalition for Literacy, include the
Delta Delta Delta Sorority, Un-
dergraduate Social Work Club,
New Student Network and Stu-
dent Fiction and Poetry
Workshop.

The final details of the SCL are
still in the making.

Block stated that they ”are
working with a range of ideas in
getting college students involved.
These include forming some kind
of work—study arrangement where

a student gets rewarded for his
help and providing course credits
for tutoring. We're also looking
into professors sponsoring in-
dependent studies, and we're
making a variety of volunteer op-
portunities.”

GPLC’s hopes for the new coa-

lition include ”increasing aware— .

ness of the illiteracy problem”
and ”providing a way to make
the organization a permanent
part of the service programs avail-
able at the University,” said
Block. .

’’It can't just be dependent on
one or two students  lots of peo-
ple have to be involved. And we
know that they want to be, be-
cause it was Pitt's idea to do
this,” Black said. ”They came to
us.” V '

Black has been closely in-
volved in the fight against illiter-
acy for nearly eight years with the
GPLC.

He views his commitment as
”a natural outgrowth of his Peace
Corps experience teaching En-
glish as a second language in
Niger, West Africa.” _

Katz’s commitment comes
from what he describes as the‘
”side of me that wants to be in-
volved in helping people, and as
an organizer, I want to get a
whole army of peole involved.”

”[llliteracy is] one of the biggest
problems in America,” said
Schuder, ”and that's why I devote
as much time as I have to the
project  [because] literacy is
one of the things that brings out
the creative force in people.

Defense moves to throw out wiretap evidence

W PITTSBURGH (AP) ~ A
defense attorney at the counter-
feiting trial of white supremacist
James Wickstrom asked a feder-
al judge Wednesday to throw out
wiretap evidence that is a central
part of the prosecution's case.

U.S. District Judge Glenn
Mencer did not rule immediately.

0 After surprise testimony Tues-
day from prosecution witness
Victor Rizzo, 54, a chiropractor
from Patton, Cambria County,
Wickstrom’s attorney, Michael
Rosenfield, claimed Wednesday
that Rizzo was coerced into al-
lowing a tap to be placed on his
phone.

Prosecutors say three recorded
conversations led to Wickstrom,
45.

Rizzo testified that he cooper-
ated with federal agents only af-
ter they threatened to jail his

$19-year—old son.

”We’re dealing with a situation
where the government uses
blackmail and intimidation to
break the will of an individual,”
Rosenfield said.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Bradley

Barbin argued that Rizzo began
cooperating immediately after his
arrest June 22, before the time he
claims the threats were made. He
changed his story after his arrest
became public knowledge, Bar-
bin said.

Federal authorities allege that
Wickstrom tried to buy and dis-
tribute counterfeit money and
planned to finance activities by
the racist group he founded,
Posse Comitatus. A co—defendant,
David ”Sarge” Gardner, 44, of
Greensburg, is charged with con-
spiracy to distribute counterfeit
money.

UA W hearing with
Mack continues

ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) ~ Two
former security guards testified as
Mack Trucks Inc. began its
defense in a National Labor Re-
lations Board hearing into the fir-
ings of 14 workers at the
company's Winnsboro, S.C.,
plant.

STATE BRIEFS

The United Auto Workers con-
tends that Mack Trucks violated
fair labor laws and engaged in
”union—busting” when it fired the

14 workers. The NLRB has ac—‘

cused the company of firing the
employees, including four from
South Carolina, because of their
union-organizing activities.

Security guard Gregory Jones of
Winnsboro said that, in another
incident, Fajardo made a
threatening gesture toward him,
and he filed a report that played
a role in Fajardo’s dismissal.

In testimony about a sexual
harassment case that led to the fir-
ing of another transferee, area su-
pervisorjames Heimppel said he
saw Phillippe Carroll grab a fe-
male co-worker’s buttocks to
boost her into the cab of a truck.

Mack spokeswoman Deb
Woolley said Carroll was fired af-
ter he was cited for a second in-
fraction -— playing with the line
emergency stop button.

Bipartisan study on
radon threat needed

HARRISBURG (AP) — A House
Democrat on Wednesday pro-
posed a resolution that calls for
the creation of a bipartisan com-
mittee to study Pennsylvania's
problems with radon gas.

Rep. Ruth C. Rudy of Centre
County said she would introduce
the resolution in the house be-
cause new laws are needed to
handle the problem of radon, a
colorless, odorless gas suspected
of causing cancer.

The committee would have six
months to hold public hearings,
study reports on radon and
recommend future legislation ad-
dressing the problem, she said.

The Department of Environ-
mental Resources and the feder-
al Environmental Protection

Agency have been addressing the
radon issue for several years, but
Rudy said there is still confusion
about toxic levels of the gas and
how to get rid of it.

Bill approved on ice
quality inspections

HARRISBURG (AP) - Legisla-
tion unanimously approved by a
House committee Wednesday
would require businesses with
ice machines and plants that
manufacture ice to undergo regu-
lar inspections by the Department
of Environmental Resources.

The House Consumer Affairs
Committee voted in favor of the
bill that would set up a system to
license, inspect and regulate all
the state’s ice—making machines
and check the quality of import-
ed ice.

By Michael C. Lingo

For The Pitt News

Attempting a definition of the
Cocteau Twins as a musical unit
is a somewhat useless endeavor.
Their music is an intangible,
ethereal effort that is not con-

Qtained by the restrictions of the

listener. And due to this openness
in their music, the Cocteau Twins
that I know may be completely
different from the Cocteau Twins
that anyone else may know. it is
safe to say that a good Cocteau
Twins record listens to you as op-
posed to your listening to it.

THE INFORMAL RUSH OF GAMMA SIGMA

Cocteau Twins formed in late
1981, with guitarist Robin
Guthrie, vocalist Elizabeth Fraser
and bassist Will Heggie. By the
spring of '82, the band had
recorded their first album entitled
Garlands on England's now
legendary 4AD records. The al-
bum featured a definitively
unique aura. it left spaces that
even Joy Division may have at-
tempted to fill. ~

And in between the sparseness,
Will Heggie’s remarkable bass
lines kept the bottom intact as
Robin Guthrie was able to coax
the most beautiful sounds from

his guitar, with an early prototype
drum machine, the kind Ginger
Baker may even tolerate, kicking
a driving beat.

Elizabeth Fraser's voice added
the perfect complement to the
music. Both scary and beautiful,
she exhibits an excellent range
and inaudible lyrics that make
her voice the band's third instru-
ment. Listen once to ”Wax and
Wane,” and the foreboding, war-
bling quality of Fraser's voice is
evident.

Will Heggie’s bass lines on
”The Hollow Men” and the title
track, as well as ”Blind Dumb
Deaf,” are evidence of the

rethinking of the bass by the likes
of Pete Hook and Jah Wobble.
Needless to say, the album was
similar to nothing before it; a re-
evaluation of musical structure
and form.

Unfortunately, Will Heggie left
the band by the summer of 1983,
after the release of the Lullabies
and Peppermint Pig 12-inches.
The band continued as a two-
piece, with Guthrie taking over
the entire musical aspect.

Their next release, Head Over
Heels, showed Guthrie expand-
ing the music with the use of
more instrumentation, including
the use of bells and the incredi-

.Cocteau Twins release another treasure on 4AD

ble xylophone-sounds of ”The
Tinderbox of a Heart.” Tracks on
the LP showed a different side of
the band. A less abrasive sound
on tracks, like the lilting ”Sugar
Hiccup”and the smoothness of
”Mussette and‘ Drums,” opened
the door to an escalating sound
which the band would crystallize
on Treasure.

This shift continued with the
brilliantly arranged and produced
Sunburst and Snowblind 12-inch.
it featured ”Sugar Hiccup” and
several other cascading tracks,
”Hitherto” being the song most
indicative of the vein in which

Music critics, friends, salespeople and you. -
know the most important part of a stereo
system is the loudspeaker. To improve your
sound. you look for better speakers. You
search all the stores and read all the ads
(including classifieds). You even listen to
hucksters selling great speaker promises from
their vans and car trunks.

Few companies make great speakers.
even fewer are able to make a great
speaker at a low price. BOSTON ACOUSTICS
is an exception to this rule.

Robert Frank is back on the road and rolling

Dmitri Ragano
For The Pitt News

   

 

Candy Mountain gave me a
mild case of deja vu. The new
Robert Frank film owes more
than a little of its picaresque hip—
ness to Kerouac’s On the Road
and road films such as Easy Riderm
and Stranger Than Paradise. And”
like so many films these days, it's
full of references to music and
rock ’n’ roll culture.

But somehow, Candy Moun-
tain never turns into a cliche.
There is a mixture of wit and
cruel honesty that gives the
movie a very original feel. Can-
dy Mountain is a worthy addition
to the ”road film” genre.

The film begins with Julius
(Kevin O'Connor), a second-rate
guitar player on the skids in New
York City. After playing a gig for‘...
a club singer (David Johansen), '
Julius overhears some record ex-
ecutives discussing a guitar

  legend named Elmore Silk.

with the businessmen. A little
 later, he is headed upstate in
search of Silk and his big break.
During his odyssey, he meets '7“
a number of off—the—wall charac-
ters. First,‘ he contacts Silk’s
brother (Tom Waits), a bizarre

Two years ago, one of the most
arrogant and loudest bands ever
to use a drum machine broke up.
Big Black fans were left wonder-

be a lawyer and, even more bi-

to law school.

Since then, Big Black master-
mind Steve Albini has been wan-
dering the musical wastelands
searching for ways to occupy his
time. To his credit, he produced

Now, after a creative absence

mind—blowing experience. Albini
pleads, ”Budd, don’t!” He later
screams, ”He’s my god, he's the
scene, he is pure genius!” Albi-
ni’s proclivity for the perverse
hasn't changed much since Big
Black and ”Jordan, Minnesota.”

The other three songs sound
more reminiscent of Big Black, if
you can imagine Big Black with
a drummer. ”Log Bass” and
”Dutch Courage” are more
straight ahead rock ’n’ roll than
”Budd.”

A|bini’s guitar work is a bit
more sparse than on Big Black
records. He's taken to making
weird noises and feedback, creat-
ing an atmosphere around the
bass and drum work of David
Simms and Rey Washam. ”Dutch
Courage” was the only song from
a ”disastrous studio session” to
make the EP. The other three
songs were recorded live, some-
where in the great Midwest.

Albini’s return is more than
welcome. Rapeman may take a
couple of listenings to get ac-
customed to, but it delivers what
one would expect from Albini:
pure deviance.

the band was to flow. Shortly
thereafter, Cocteau Twins added
Simon Raymonde on bass in late
1983.

New material was written and
the 1984 release of the Pearly-
Dewdrops’ Drops 12-inch
showed them at what was nearly
the peak of their musical collage.
With the title track and ”The
Spangle Maker,” a certain area of
musical’ nirvana had been en-
tered where no band had tread
before.

in 1984, the band also record-
ed ”Millimillenary” for a New
Music Express compilation tape.
And in the summer of 1984, Coc-
teau Twins released what is
perhaps the most strikingly beau-
tiful album ever released, entitled
Treasure. Treasure’s atmospheric
and nearly gothic quality showed
the band at the peak of their ex-
pressiveness.

The songs have a tendency to
mesh together, and the band
winds patterns of sound around
what is Elizabeth Fraser's finest
vocal performance. Songs like
”|vo”(named after a 4AD
producer and sometimes mem-
ber of the not-a—4AD-house—band,
This Mortal Coil), ”Lorelei” and
”Pandora” breathe with the sub-
tle energy that songs like ”Be—
Cause of Whirl—Jack” and ’’In The
Gold Dust Rush” hinted at.

Treasure was followed with the
equally impressive Aikea—Cuinea
12-inch. Cocteau Twins soon ex-
plored a slightly excessive route
in 1985 with the release of two
12—inches entitled Tiny Dyna-
mine and Echoes in a Shallow
Bay. The music contained on
both is distinctly Cocteau Twins,
yet much of the material is too
abstract, and it nearly loses itself
in the arrangement. There are,
however, several standout tracks
such as ”Pink Orange Red."

1985 also saw the release of an

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Irish, Holtz expect game of year from Pitt

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

THURSDAY, OCT. 6, ‘I988

THE PITT NEWS

are their capabilities of execu-  “
tion? I look at them on defense,
I look at them on offense. There's
no doubt that Pitt can be, on a
given Saturday, as good as any
football team in the country,”
Holtz said.

Pitt has indeed shown that it
can dominate a game. Two
games, actually — Northern Iowa
and Ohio State, 59-10 and 42-10
blowouts, respectively.

But the two most recent games
have seen ‘the Panthers do an
about face. Injuries have taken
their toll, and second—half let-
downs have proved costly.

Notre Dame, on the other
hand, has been as efficient in the
fourth quarter as in the first. The
Irish have scored 133 points to
their opponents’ 41 and averaged
374 yards per game through four
contests, including an astounding
281 yards rushing.

Defensively, the Irish have in-
tercepted eight passes, have a to-
tal of 16 quarterback sacks for a
loss of 46 yards and limited teams
to 262.5 yards per game, 96.8
yards on the ground.

”They’ve beaten Michigan,
Michigan State, Purdue, Stanford.
They beat teams that are kind of
diversified in their attack,” said
Pitt coach Mike Gottfried.

Please see Irish, page 14

If Irish coach Lou Holtz had his
way, his Notre Dame team might
never again play in the state of
Pennsylvania.

The Irish limped out of the
Quaker State in 1987 with an 0-2
record — losses coming at the
hands of Pitt and Penn State. The
Panthers were the first team to
defeat Notre Dame after a 3-0
start.

Holtz said he would not play
games at both team's home stadi-
ums in the same year again.

But Pitt will get another chance
at the spoiler role this Saturday
when Notre Dame comes to Pitt
Stadium foiyja 4 p.m. match—up to
be televised nationally by ESPN.

Holtz knows what Pitt is capa-
ble of.

”They took the football and,
with power and virtually the
same offensive line, moved it
down the field,” Holtz said, refer-
ring to Pitt's play in last season's
game.

This season? ’’I think Pitt may
be the most talented team we've
played, on both sides of the
football.

”Pitt has a tendency to
dominate a game. I look at a foot-
ball team and evaluate it. What

The University of Colorado

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October 6, I988

Buckeyes five more times, I'll bet
they would win three.

Notre Dame-31, Pitt-13

It's true that Pitt has made a
habit of knocking off the Irish in
the past three attempts, but Notre
Dame just looks awesome. This
game will be close until the third
quarter, but the Irish will break it
open. I hope I'm wrong, but only
a fool would pick the Panthers
this Saturday.

Michigan-24,
State-21

Not a good year for’ George
Perles’ winless Spartans.

Kansas-29, Nebraska-2

Yuk-yuk. I just wanted to see if
you were paying attention. Make
that Nebraska—49, Kansas-6.

Oklahoma-31, Te-xas-14

This is one of college football's
truly great rivalries, but this year,
as in recent years, it will not be

Michigan

a great game.

Southern Cal-23, Oregon-10

The Ducks upset USC last year,
but this year the Trojans are for
real. Oregon does not deserve to
be ejected from the Top 20 for
losing to this USC team.

LSU-27, Auburn-21

I just have a feeling that LSU
will not lose three straight games.
A loss by the Tigers would prob-
ably knock them completely out
of the SEC race.

Second Upset of the Week

Colorado-21,
State-20

This is the most important
game for Colorado in many
years. They'll probably win, but
don't be too surprised if they
blow it. Nothing like covering all
options by picking a team to win
but then saying not to be too'sur—
prised if they lose.

200—yard game pushes
Curvin Richards into
mighty fine company

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

In 1973, freshman Tony Dor-
sett broke into the Pitt scene by
rushing for over 200 yards on
three occasions, including a 265-
yard performance against North-
western and a 209—yard perfor-
mance against Notre Dame, the
Panthers’ opponents this week.

Dorsett went on to become the
all—time leading rusher for the
Panthers, winning the Heisman
Trophy his senior year of 1976 to
boot

Last week against Boston Col-
lege, Curvin Richards introduced
himselfto Pitt fans by rushing for
202 yards, the only freshman
since Dorsett to reach the 200-
plus plateau.

While it is still too early to

make comparisons between the
two, it is not too early to realize
that, with performances such as
this, Richards could make a huge
impact on the Panthers through-

out his playing days.

”I didn't think I was close to
200 yards,” said Richards, who
was named ECAC Rookie of the
week. ’’I was just running the ball
and trying for the first downs. I
just wanted to move the ball
down the field.”

Richards was forced into action
when starting tailback Adam
Walker went down with a first-
half ankle injury.

”It felt good,” Richards said
simply of becoming only the
eighth player in Pitt history to
gain 200 yards in a single outing.
”I was happy. I wanted to play
my freshman year. I didn't want
to be red-shirted; that was one of
my goals.

”When I scored my first college
touchdown, all I heard was the
announcer saying that ‘Curvin
Richards has scored a 47-yard
touchdown.’ Everything else
went blank. It made a believer
out of me. I now know I can

A important quarterback position.

Injury, lack of playing time frusttesak

By Ed Kuznik I  "
Staff Writer

Injuries have decimated almost
every facet of the 1988 Pitt foot-
ball team, but perhaps nowhere
can that fact become more appar-
ent in the Panthers’ game against
Notre Dame than at the all-

Right now, starter Darnell
Dickerson is in fine health,
despite an injury to his left eye in
the West Virginia contest, and is
ready to lead Pitt against the
Fighting Irish. But looking at the
situation pessimistically, yet
realistically, one play could
change Dickerson’s physical sta-
tus in a hurry.

If Dickerson is indeed injured,
then he would normally pass the
torch off to Larry Wanke. But
Wanke suffered a separated

two weeks ago and is not likely
to see action against Lou Holtz’
team.

The only other quarterbacks
listed on Pitt’s roster are Yusef
Washington, Alex Van Pelt, Dean
E|—Attrache and Kieran Scanlon.

Irish

Continued from page 11

”They’re very good on offense.
Defensively, they just shut every-
body down. I don't see any weak-
nesses in them. I think when you
look at them, they are one of the
five best teams in the country,”
he added.

— a quarterback who can run the

out with a broken clavicle, has
been nothing short of spectacu-
lar this season, rushing for 293
yards and four touchdowns, as
well as completing 20 of 41 pass-
es for 304 yards and three
touchdowns.

”He’s progressed. He's still a
long ways away from where he
will be eventually, but he keeps
getting better every week. He's a
competitor,” Holtz said.

The Irish opened the season
with a plethora of talented run-
ning backs. ”We thought that one
strength of our football team was

going to be the running back po-
sition but we’ve been depleted
there,” Holtz said.‘

Ricky Watters was moved to
flanker, Braxton Banks was lost
for an indefinite period of time,
Tony Banks is outwith a broken
foot, Anthony Johnson has
missed two games with a bad an-
kle and Mark Green, who leads
all Irish rushers with 293 yards
and two touchdowns, is ”banged
up,” according to Holtz.

But the Irish have persevered.
Nine receivers have been
deployed, combining for 372
yards and four TDs.

”We’ve improved offensively.
We had to rebuild an offense,”
Holtz said. ’’I think our offensive
line and the development of it
has been pleasant. Our receivers
are starting to mature and de-
velop. Overall offensively, we've
played well enough to win four
footbal games, but I don’t know
if we've played well enough to
win five.”

One major point of concern for
Holtz is the big-play capability of
Pitt's offense.

”I think Pitt certainly is a big-
play offense team. They just do
so many things; they give you
such a problem. They run the op-
tion, they can make big plays off
the option,” Holtz said.

”The long pass [a 76-yard
touchdown reception by Henry
Tuten against Boston College] on
Saturday came off the option.
Their passing game is very, very
effective. They just have good ta-
lent, and they do an awful lot of
different things.”

But the Irish defense has not
given up big plays this season.
Opponents average 2.8 yards per
carry, 5.3 yards per pass.

The linebackers have been the
most solid spot of the defense so
far, deep enough to have one of
last year's starters, Ned Bolcar,
moved to second—string behind
Mike Stonebreaker.

The secondary has been effec-
tive as well. The defensive back-
field has four combined
interceptions, with senior strong
safety George Streeter tied for the
team lead with two.

A talented Pitt team defeated
the Irish last year, and although
Pitt is again a talented squad, in-
juries have taken some of the bite
from Pitt's play, particularly the
defense. »

”Injury-wise, we’ve got a lot of
people hurt,” Gottfried said.
”We’ve got to make some deci-
sions a little earlier this week on
injured people, try to get some of
the younger players out.”
Center Dean Caliguire left the
Boston College game after suffer-
ing a thigh contusion. John
Glesky has been taking most of
the snaps at practice, with guard
Mark Stepnoski backing him up.

In the backfield, freshman tail-
back Curvin Richards should play

in his second full game after

Adam Walker left the BC contest
with an ankle injury.

Richards filled in admirably,
rushing for 202 yards and two
touchdowns.

So it will be Pitt's big offensive
play and injury—depleted team
versus Notre Dame's fundametal-
ly sound, offensively rebuilt
squad. What does Holtz expect?

”I don't think it's any real mys-
tery that Pitt will play the best
game against us that they have all
year. What we’ve got to do is
make sure we play the best game
against them.”

Irish safety Streeter is writing his Wanke I

’ own script, on and off field

By Theresa Kelly

Assistant Sports Editor, The Observer

Who are Oatmeal Man and the
Nabisco Kid, and what do they
have to do with the Notre Dame
secondary?

The connection is Irish senior
strong safety George Streeter.

The creative side of Streeter
does not come across on the foot-
ball field, but off of it, Streeter is
very soft—spoken and creative for
a 6—foot-2, 200-pound football
player.

”One of the problems with be-
ing an athlete is that, to be a good

athlete, you can't be diversified,” '

Streeter said. ”You can’t be well-
rounded. You have to specialize

Q all the time. Those of us who do

have other talents are stereotyped
as only being able to play
football.”

OK, but who is the Nabisco
Kid?

-”One story I wrote, a children's
story, was about Oatmeal man
and the Nabisco Kid. The whole
story was about cookies - every-
body in it was a cookie,” Street-
er explains. ”People liked that
story.” .

But writing for kids, as well as
drawing and designing, is not
what you expect of Streeter.

”A lot of people I know
wouldn't know that I can write,
wouldn't know that I can draw,
wouldn't know that I like to do
those things,” he said. ”A thing
I really like to do is coloring in gi-
ant coloring books, but nobody

0 would guess that.”

Most of Streeter’s work gets
thrown into the wastebasket, but
last year, he had a mural of a
California beach done in chalk

on the wall of his dorm room.
”They painted over it this
year,” he said, ”but people al-
ways said something. They al-
ways liked it. My talent as an
artist is limited. I'm no Rem-
brandt, that’s for sure.”
Although his creative interests
have taken a backseat at Notre

    

George Streeter.
Dame because of the lack of free
time, Streeter is a marketing
major, which he said is a way for
him to use his creativity in the
business world.

On the football field, though,
Streeter is all business.

In the first three games of the
season, Streeter was in on 15
tackles and intercepted two pass-
es, both in the first half of Notre
Dame’s 52-7 drubbing of Purdue.
The two interceptions tied him
for the lead with linebacker Mike
Stonebreaker.

”My biggest game, even my
biggest half, was against Purdue,”
he explained. ”The two intercep-
tions tied both my season and
career highs at the same time.
That game was good because we
knew what we had to do, we had
the opportunity to do it, and we
got it done.”

Streeter has played in every
Irish football game since he came

to Notre Dame in 1985.

Streeter learned early how to
deal with long days of school and
football. As an athlete at Chica-
golulian High School, he was on
the move from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m.

”The school is on the far South
Side,” he said. ’’I lived further
north, and I had to catch the bus
every day. I had to be out of the
house at six o'clock, and I got
home the same time I get home
now, eight o‘clock, with practice
and all.”

Four players who graduated
with Streeter from Julian earned
scholarships to play football. The
tradition continued in the Street-
er family and at Julian as Street-
er’s younger brother, Sean, is a
linebacker at the University of II-
linois. .

Another facet of Streeter’s per-
sonality that is not apparent on
the football field is his involve-
ment with the team’s Fellowship
of Christian Athletes organiza-

In preseason practice, the Pitt
coaches indicated that there was
a chance that Wanke and Dick-
erson would split time early in
the season, but that never materi-
alized, as Dickerson quickly
grabbed control and ran away
with the job.

Dickerson played well for the
first two games, but when he was
poked in the eye against WVU,
Wanke had his shot to let the
team know he did not drop off
the face of the Earth. As luck
would have it, however, he was
injured after only a few minutes
of action.

’’Believe me, it's frustrating,”
Wanke said. ”I got in there for
eight minutes, and to get hurt 
that's really tough.”

Wanke said that he did not
know why the coaches decided
against the platoon system but
would not let himself get down
about his situation.

”It’s just one of those things
about football. You have a lot of
peoplewho can do the job,”
Wanke said. ’’I have to accept a
role as a second—team player. In
a way, it's a challenge because
you always have to be ready 
you never know when you'll be
in there.

’’I think I'm a confident leader.
I don't think I can do some of the
things that Darnell can [do], but
I also don’t feel the level of play
goes down when I'm in there.”

Even though there was no offi-
cial indication by Gottfried, Van
Pelt, only a freshman, would
probably have taken over the QB
slot had something happened to
Dickerson in last week's Boston
College game. A decision has not
yet been made as to who the No.
2 man will be if Wanke cannot
perform on Saturday.

score on a collegiate level.”

The last time Richards covered
more yardage in a single outing
was when his family moved from
their native land of Trinidad to
LaPorte, Texas. One of seven
children, Richards appreciated
the sacrifices his parents made for
them, including the move to the
United States. A job opportunity
for his father drew his family to
Texas when Richards was 9 years
old.

”He was a role model for me,”
said Richards of his father, who
died one year after the move.
”He really cared about the fami-
ly and other people. He was a
hard worker.”

Richards has picked up on
some of those traits. He’s willing
to give the extra effort, push a lit-
tle harder, or go the extra mile —
or yard — whichever may be the
case.

’’I try to give 100 percent eve-
ry time,” said Richards. ”If I don't
do my best or I slack off, I could
get hurt.” ’

Another trait that stands out is
Richards’ willingness to work for
the team goal. While personal
bests might be an added plus,
they don't mean as much as team
success to him.

”God gave me the ability to
run the football, and that's what
I'm going to do,” Richards said.
”|’l| do anything to help the team.

”The next seven games, we
have to forget the last four. We
have to start the whole season
over and not lose. We have the
right people at the right positions.
We have the right personnel.”

|t’s been less than a week since
Richards showed the football
world what he is capable of, but
it may as well have been two
years.

"I don't feel like a freshman,”
said Richards. ”Once I put on the
uniform and step out onto the
field, I feel like a Pitt football
player.”

”The attitude has Changed
since Coach Holtz has been

I here,” Streeter said. ”First year,

we found out we Could win; the
second year, we found out that if
we played well, we'd go to a
bowl game, and this year we ex-

disappointed if we don't. It's all

”Our goal is to be playing for

Continued from page 9

The new places and people
seem to be an- important asset to
the band, and every member can
recount a favorite experience.

Chris remembers the hospita-
ble people and especially the al-
ligators in Florida.

Dennis has surrealistic
memories of Florida as well. ”l
really liked St. Petersburg,” he
says. ’’I went to the Salvador Dali
Museum and it was great.”

John, meanwhile, has had his
mind on more culturally impor-
tant issues. ”All the college girls,”
he says, ”that’s been my favorite
so far. They know how to cut
loose and have a good time.”

Behind -all the fun times and
fond memories lie the devotion
and drudgery behind the musical
profession.

Michael is notonly the front-
man for the band; he is also the
historian. His life and Social Dis-
tortion’s life go hand in hand. His
tranquil vigor comes through not
only in his raspy vocals but in his
fascinating narration as well.

”We started as a punk band

eight years ago,” Michael says,
folding his heavily tattooed arms
behind his head. ”One thing I do
know is that Social Distortion has
never done what was popular at
the time. _

’’In '82, when the hardcore
scene got real popular, the mu-
sic was really fast with screaming
vocals; we were still doing the
kind of music that we wanted to
do, which was more melodic,
more rock ’n’ roll. We're just go-
ing back into our roots, which is
all the way back in the '40s, '50s
and '60s.”

With such dated influences and
Michael's obvious fascination for

nostalgia, which is also shared by
the other band members, it's easy
to see from where Social Distor-
tion’s complex, original rock ’n’
roll style was derived.

”The Stones probably have the
biggest influence on us,” says
Michael. ”There’s‘ the Ramones
and the Clash, too.”

Another State of Mind, which
portrayed Social Distortion on
their first full-scale tour, was one
of the few films to reveal the es-
sence of punk.

’’I think [the film producers] ex-
posed a good side of the punk
scene that the media has always
failed to show,” says Michael.

”As far as the public’s concerned,
punk rockers slash themselves
with razor blades and carve
swastikas. it's a really misunder-
stood thing. The movie showed
a side of it that doesn't get to be
shown too much."

It was obvious from the five-
year period of silence that fol-
lowed Mommy’5 Little Monster
that Social Distortion‘ was ex-
periencing problems that the
band had to sort through and
overcome in order to continue.

’’In the last five years, we've
gone through a lot of personnel
changes, personnel problems and
financial problems,” says

Michael. ”We’ve gone through in
five years what some bands go
through in 20 and we managed
to stay together, so I think there's
someone up there helping us.”

One of the obstacles that the
band had to overcome was
Michael's substance abuse,
which isnow a thing of the past.

”l’ve been places where [drugs
and alcohol] can take you that
some people have never even
dreamed of, so for me it's not an
option anymore,” says Michael.

Despite Michael's personal ab-
stinence and circulating rumors,
Social Distortion hasn't adopted

a straightedged view.

”My personal experience with
drugs and alcohol was pretty
widely publicized, but by no
means do we preach or try to say
we’re straightedged,” Michael
says. , ’’I don't have anything
against people who drink or do
drugs, I'm just one of those peo-
ple who can’t. The fellows in the
band like to drink beer and that's
fine.”

Faced with such adversity,
many bands would have quickly
crumbled, but Social Distortion’s
passion for producing music kept
them together.

’’It’s a certain lust we have. I

Michael. ”My love for music and
playing music is really strong. it
just kept me hanging in there.”

Social Distortion’s music and
prospective goals now override
personal pleasures. This new at-
titude can be credited for the
release of Prison Bound and the
band's exuberance for their cur-
rent tour.

”Our attitudes have changed as
far as the band goes,” says
Michael, ”as far as looking at this
like it's work. It isn’t a big party
anymore. The last two years
we've been working hard on this
record, just working hard,

Coupled with all the other
changes Social Distortion has en-
dured, it’s amazing that their mu-
sical style hasn’t changed as well.
The lyrics still project many of
Michael’s personal philosophies,
along with the band's hearty, dis-
torted, rock ’n’ roll style.

’’I believe you can mature and
still keep the same ideals that you
had when you started,” says
Michael. ”Bands like Iggy Pop
and X, as far as I'm concerned,
are still doing the same stuff they

were doing eight or nine years ix 

 

road, touring America, pushing 

their new album, doing it all with

a hope for the future that they -
gained from their rigorous past. "
”We want to keep doingthis,” g,~ ~ 
says Michael. ”We don't see any ‘_f’_~~t:'
reason why there should be  ‘_
another five—year lapse ever .i S‘

Playwrite and director, Horton Foote.

By Patricia Lomando White
Staff Writer

It was an electrically charged
opening night with many Pitts-
burgh personalities on hand to
view the many splendid charac-
ters unveiled in award—winning
playwright Horton; Foote’s The
Habitation of Dragons, which
opened last Wednesday at the
Pittsburgh Public Theater.

The play, directed by Foote and
set in Harrison, Texas, during
1935, opens with a confrontation
between brothers George (Hor-
ton Foote Jr.) and Leonard (Mar-
co St. John) Tolliver. Leonard,
who had previously dissolved a
law partnership with his brother,
informs George that he is bring-
ing his brother—in—law Billy

mily farm. Leonard refuses to
allow George to sell it outside the
family and convinces him to ac-
cept his low price. George sees
himself as the underdog and
claims he has continually
sacrificed himself for Leonard's

prosperity.

This scene, while just a sample
of the disharmony and revela-
tions to come, injects an air of
tension, making the audience feel
as theughthey have stumbled
upon an incident that they have
no business observing. And if you
are a little uncomfortable, just
hold on to your seat because
almost as often as each new
character makes his entrance,"we
learn more than the casual ‘ob-
server may want to about this
close-knit Texas family.

Lenora Tolliver (Isa Thomas) is
the matriarch who works to hold

the family together. And, like any
loving mother who sees friction
between her children, she be-
comes a mediator between her
sons. We learn more about
Lenora’s cohesiveness through
her actions. Years earlier, she
brought a boy of mixed parentage
into her home when his mother
died. This gesture is quite
astonishing when we remember
the South of that time period. And
for the last 15 years, she has rent-
ed a room, at the same rent, to
Miss Helen (Eugenia Rawls), a
distant cousin. When Leonard
tells her she‘ should be getting
more for the room, Lenora says
it's all Helen can afford and that
she likes having her there be-
cause Helenvis her ”link to the
past.”

Helen is also our link to the
past. Through her somber
reminiscences, spoken in soft,”

clear Southern dialect, we hear
several anecdotes about the fami-
ly’s past. And in Act II, it is
through her that we experience
the mood set by the recent fami-
ly tradegies.

Another strong character in the

‘play is Leonard's wife Margaret

(Hallie Foote). Hers is a transfor-
mation from a confident and hap-
py, yet restless woman, to one
who is tortured and bereaved.
The torture is mostly self—inflicted,
since her guilt forces her to ac-
cept blame for the horrible trage-
dy. While begging for her
husband's forgiveness, it is clear
that she cannot forgive herself.

And Virgil Tolliver (Conrad
McLaren), the opinionated but
senile uncle, gives us the only
moments of laughter in this seri-
ous work. Yet he, too, has a seri-
ous side. His spouted theories

and bouts of forgetfulness, often
at the most inappropriate times,
'create for us a character of great
depth. He blames himself for his
brother's death and is also
ashamed of the way he treated
his brother's family.

The play’s title is taken from the
Bible. ”In the habitation of dra-
gons, where each lay, shall be
grass with reeds and rushes,”

Isaiah 35:7. In spite of the dark-
ness and despair, we endure and
often flourish. V

This play, running almost three
hours, features all that is present
in relationships and families -
Iove, hatred, bitterness, deceit,
loss and forgiveness. All of this is
exemplified through the richly
woven characters created by
Foote and performed by the very
capable actors.

excellent singles collection, The

Pink Opaque.

With the release of Victorialand
in 1986, the Cocteau Twins had
become slightly more excessive,
and the album is somewhat lack-
ing the cohesiveness of former
Cocteau Twins releases.
However, with the release of the
incredibly lush Love’s Easy Tears
12-inch, featuring the brilliant
”Orange Appled,” they had
returned to better days.

In 1986, Fraser and Guthrie did
work with.This Mortal Coil and
the Cocteau Twins also worked
with Harold Budd and released

‘ an album under the pseudonym

The Moon and The Melodies.

 Then,l_M987 brought only the song
”Crushed” from 4AD’s Lonely As

An Eyesore compilation, and
Guthrie's production work with
other 4AD bands, such as DifJuz.
Cocteau Twins’ latest release
Blue Bell Knoll is an amalgama-
tion of several starting points in
the band's career. The title track

offers a very subtle, slow—moving

rhythm that almost never begins.
Yet, the rest of side one is an ex-
cellent offering, nearly as lush as
Treasure. The orchestration of
tracks like ”Athol—Brose” and
”Carolyn’s Fingers” is excellent,
and at times the guitar sound
seems acoustic.

Elizabeth Fraser's voice is as
good as ever, and it's less murky
than some of the vocal tracks on
Victoria/and. The bass lines on
side two seem to be buried too

deeply, yet the effects of

Guthrie's guitar playing are near-
ly enough to compensate.
Side two is less dense and co-

hesive than side one. High points _

include the sparkling ”Suckling
the Mender” and the softness of
”Spooning Good Singing Gum.”

The drum machine used on the
album tends to be more crisp
than that of other releases. It
works well with ”For Phoebe Still
A Baby,” yet fails on the heavily
synth-laden ”A Kissed Out Red
Floatboat.”

Overall, the album combines
elements of Tiny Dynamine and
Treasure, creating a very good
impression of the band after two
years of absence. The album is
well—produced, as expected, and
has an incredible sleeve, as ex-
pected. _And through Capitol
Records, the album has been
licensed from 4AD for the Coc-
teau Twins’ initial American
release.

If all goes well, Cocteau Twins
will be in Pittsburgh this year to

In a preliminary vote yesterday, City Council reached an expected

The Olympics show us what fluid is really important

The 1988 Olympics at Seoul,
Korea have finally proved that the
search for world peace has turned
into a search for — if you'll ex-
cuse the expletive deleted —
world pi-s. (You fill in the blank.)

Is nothing sacred anymore?
And just when the winners of the
Nobel Peace Prize were being
announced. Maybe they should
award the Nobel Pi-s Prize in-
stead. (I nominate Ben Johnson.)

But never "mind the tragedy of
Johnson and the other athletes
who were disqualified because
they were stupid enough to think
they could sneak one by those
sharp ol' Olympic officials.
What's more pressing is that a by-
product of this is that we seem to
have become a society obsessed
and ruled by - gulp -— urine.

Just prounouncing that word
gives me the willies. Why, just

J yesterday, I read that urine tests

can now detect early bladder
cancer. New discoveries are con-
sistently being made with the aid
of urine. Our ancestors would be
aghast at such liberal use of the

word in headlines! Now that's all
fine and dandy when it's used to
help the ill, but couldn't a spit
analysis prove just as reliable?
What's really depressing is, when
you think about it, of all the hu—
man bodily fluids, urine does
seem to be one of the least
offensive. '

The demand has never been so
high for this plentiful liquid. We
are choosing our athletes, our
politicians and our civil servants
by the contents of it. Why, blood
tests will soon become obsolete
for the betrothed.

Why bother to take that phys-
ics test when a little bit of "old
faithful” will prove whether or
not you know your equations? I
have frightening visions of T.A.s
passing out No. 2 flasks instead
of pencils.

Whoever said that the eyes are
the mirror of the soul was proba-
bly never asked to ''fill it up to
here.” It's a sad day when one’s
moral fiber can be more easily
read in a bottle than any autobi-
ography one might have written.

I'm worried.

Before you know it, they'll be
using urine to detect things
(gasp!) we've never dreamed of.

Why bother taking the driver's
test? You can send in a small
urine sample along with your

FRANCES
SANSIG

check . (made payable to the
Department of Transportation),
receive a card you can take with
your sample and get pho-
tographed at your nearest photo
license center..

When you apply to college,
you'll still have to take your
PSATs (Pi-s Satisfies All Teachers).

This seemingly innocuous fluid
has been the cause of much -mis-
fortune for many — and most as-
suredly many more to come.
Soon, everyone from Grandma to
Rover to the neighborhood
preacher will become suspect.

Why, ifJesus Christ were alive
today, they'd probably make him

take a urine test to see if he was
on drugs for those three days he
spent out of it in the Holy Land.

Imagine forcing a historical
figure like our great past presi-
dent, George Washington, to take
a urine test. "I cannot tell a lie."
We'll see, Georgie boy, we'll see.

Maybe if an event like that oc-
curred, it would better explain
the shape of the Washington
monument. .

And our other founding fathers
 "We the people, in order to
form a more perfect urine ..."

Enough!

Sad things to think about, but
you'll find out when you're next.

"Yes, and how much money
do you have your bank account?"

"Ah  enough to cover this
check, honest."

"Well, you'll have to prove it.
Here, take this cup ..."

Good heavens!

I'm surprised industry hasn't,

tried to capitalize on it yet. "Your
urine sample. Don't be caught
without it!" advertisements
would read for handy purse-sized

containers. "Stock up now for
winter." And how about a black
market sure-fire ad for a product
that would make your drugs un-
detectable? (It could appear next
to an ad with a cream guaranteed
to increase your bust.) The
product promises to clean out
your system: "Tidy-Bowel."

The advent of a new era in tel-
evision game shows could begin:
Battle of the Network Bottles, or
Win, Lose or Pi-s, etc.

I don't know, maybe it's just
the word I find offensive. Maybe
a nice euphemism might ease my
anguish.

One positive outcome might
be an increase in the number of
public restroom facilities and
more pocket money for those
who hold stock in Dixie cups.

And then, perhaps all ‘this

merely serves to prove that Ma-
hatma Ghandi was ahead of his
time.

He sure could quaff the stu—ff.

Frances Sansig is a columnist
for The Pitt News.

The disadvantaged don't need money to be smart

, A WPTS DJ came to the office
yesterday to talk to me. It _seems
thata rather ignorant statement
was made by Melanie Naro fol-
lowing a commentary that the sta-

-tion aired last Thursday.

The topic addressed in the
commentary was the proposed
savings—bond bill, which would
enable parents to purchase col-
lege tuition credits to be
redeemed when their child
reached college—age.

During the commentary, Naro,
a member of the Students for
Bush organization, discussed her
position in favor of the proposed
legislation. I -

Following the commentary, off
the air, the DJ asked Naro what
good this program would be to
families who were unable to af-
ford the savings bonds. "

She responded, "People who
don't have any money won't be

going to college — and they
probably don't have the grades
anyway.”

The DJ who presented this
ridiculous statement to me was

The thing that I am most
bothered about in this presiden-
tial campaign is that each of the
candidates is in the hands of high-
ly skilled image—makers straight
out of show business. Every word
and gesture seems to be
programmed by these so-called
media specialists whose only in-
terest in politics is to get a sound
bite of their man on the evening
news.

What frightens me is that after

, the election, these advisors will

follow the winner into the White
House and continue running his
life from there.

"Mr. President, the deficit has
just hit the 2-trillion dollar mark."

"Oh, my God, what do I do?"

"Well, first you get up from be-
hind your desk, very slowly, and
pretend that this happens every
day. Then you walk over to the
window and look out at the Rose
Garden for a couple of beats, and
finally, you turn around, look
straight into the camera and say,

  

MINDY

careful to point out that it had not
been made on the air, so it wasn't
recorded and did not exist on the
transcript.

Since I couldn't be sure that
Naro had been quoted verbatim,
I telephoned her to verify her
statement. She told me that she
had said it, but that it had been
taken out of_context.

I askedrher what she had actu-
ally meant, in context, by her
comment.

Singing and dancing

‘Oh nuts.’ "

”Two trillion dollars. Isn't there
any action I can take?"

"You should put on some
makeup. The polls indicate that
45 percent of the public thinks
your nose is too shiny. We have
a saying on Madison Avenue,
‘When you're President of the
United States, never let the Rus-

ART  
BUCHWALD

sians see you sweat.’ "

"Mr. President, Mr. President,
Noriega has just closed the Pana-
ma Canal and wants 25,000 tons
of marijuana before he'll open it
again.”

"That sounds like a serious
public relations problem that
could hurt my credibility in the
South."

"That's true, Mr. President, and
we'll get the writers on it immedi-

She replied, "Statistics show
that socio-economic status corre-
lates with. intelligence level." I

I didn't ask Ms. Naro where she
had gotten her statistics. Perhaps
I should have. I know quite a few
very intelligent people who were
born under unfortunate social
and economic conditions.

Naro further explained that the
odds are against children of
broken or impoverished homes
rising above their situations to at-
tend college and "make it out of
the slums."

I told Ms. Naro that my inten-
tion was to write a column in-
volving our discussion.

To her credit, she explained
that her own up—bringing had not
been an "unfortunate" one, that
her parents had been able to sup-
port and care for her financially.

This gave me some respect for
her in that she‘ was, in a way, ad-
mitting that she didn't have a full
understanding of the situation.
She couldn't possibly identify
with the predicament of an im-
poverished or otherwise deprived

child, having never been in that
situation herself.

I, however, can. Maybe that's
where my anger about her state-
ment is coming from. I resent it.
It's untrue.

Many people who don't have
any money will be going to col-
lege because they will earn the
grades to get accepted. I know
this factually, from experience,
unlike those elusive statistics
which Naro mentioned.

My suggestion is that instead of
reciting statistics, people might
begin to take a closer look at
what's actually around them.

I see hundreds of people (and
there are probably thousands) at
my own university who have
come from broken and im-
poverished homes to college. In
fact, I, myself, am an example of
that situation.

I could accept that it is more
difficult for a disadvantaged stu-
dent to attend college. They have
more concerns: money for books,
food, laundry, etc. What I cannot
accept is that these students

"probably don't havethe grades
anyway."

Am I expected to believe that
poor equals stupid? Or if you're
disadvantaged, you simply don't
care to better yourself? That part,
I just. can't buy.

There isn't a psychologist, so-
ciologist, politician (or statisti-
cian) alive who could convince
me of that because I see proof all
around me against it. "‘

I know it happens. I know that
some disadvantaged students ar-
en't motivated to do well in
school or attend college. But at
the same time, I see otherstu-
dents of solid backgrounds and
stable homes who also lack that
motivation.

Could it be that both types of
people have made this decision
regardless of opposite back-
grounds? That's what my ex-
perience has shown me. Naro's
statistics have shown her
otherwise.

Reagan wore the day we bombed
Libya."

"Mr. President, this came in
from the Treasury Department. In
order to avoid going bankrupt,
we'll have to raise income taxes."

"What shall I say to the Ameri-
can people? I made a promise not
to raise them."

"We'll damage-control it, sir.
We want you to stand over here
next to the presidential seal and
say, ‘When I promised not to
raise your taxes, I was drunk.’ "

''I can't say that."

"That was a joke. We'll have
you make the announcement in
a corn field in Iowa, and we will
slip it in while you're driving a
harvester across the amber waves
of grain."

"I can do it."

"Mr. President, are you going
to meet Gorbachev this af-
ternoon?" ,

"I think so. Why do you ask?"

"We want you to upstage him
by kissing him before he kisses
you. The last time you were

«together, he got all the best

camera angles."

”Now, after Gorbachev, you
have a meeting with the Eagle
Scout who willpresent you with
a flag."

"I'm looking foward to that. Is
it a debate?"

"Not exactly. But we aren't tak-
ing any chances. We have a kid
from the White House mail room

who will play the role of the Ea-
gle Scout during rehearsals. He'll
throw every question in the book
at you, and you'll pretend it's the
real thing."

"I'm not afraid. I am a great de-
bater. That's how I won the elec-
tion. The trick is to be yourself so
that everyone knows you are a
real person. Does anybody have
any good ad libs I can use when
I exchange bon mots with the
kid?"
