12 students receive UCEP
academic scholarships

Brennan Mault

   

The room in Forbes Quad could
hardly contain all of the awards and
accolades for the people in it.

The University of Pittsburgh’s
University Challenge for Excellence

Program awarded their Faison,
Henderson, and Lavelle Scholarships
on Wednesday, Oct. 16. The awards
were given to 12 students who were
among the highest-achieving African-
American men and women admitted
to Pitt.

Students from as far away as
Maine, California, Florida, New
York, and Virginia chose Pitt and
accepted full tuition scholarships. Jay
Johnson, from Los Angeles, was
awarded the Robert Lavelle scholar-
ship. He said, “I’m honored to have it
and I’m looking forward to meeting
some of the other winners.”

Besides these scholarships, all of
the recipients have outstanding high-
lights from their high school years.
All of the award winners graduated

near the top of their classes and were
members of various national honor
societies. Johnson, who managed to
balance his studies with extracurricu-
lar activities, played varsity football
and sang in a choir that recorded a
Christmas album with John Tesh.

The ceremonies were hosted by
Dr. Chentis Pettigrew Jr., assistant
dean of the faculty of arts and sci-
ences and the director of UCEP. He
said, “This is an occasion to celebrate
the achievements of some special
people and their families.”

Pettigrew spoke about how the
University will benefit from helping
the recipients throughout their col-
lege careers. He said, “We are also
celebrating our institutional accom-

plishments through the Faison,
Henderson, and Lavelle
Scholarships.”

As the men and women were
being recognized, one of the winners,
Cherise Clement, was absent. A mem-
ber of the audience said that she was
in class. Pettigrew said, “Well, I

Week shows pharmacists
aren ’t just pill counters

Marc Nuzzo

 

Pharmacists don’t just stand behind a
counter and count pills anymore.

“A lot of people have the big 1nis~
conception that that is all we do,” said
Andy Gnimore, president of the Phi Delta
Chi pharmacy fraternity and co-coordina-
tor of the National Pharmacy Week
events on campus this week.

That misconception is one of the
main motivating factors behind the pro-
grams which being presented this week
by the school of pharmacy in observance
of National Phannacy Week.

Carol Bromley, vice president of the
Academy of Students of Phannacy and
the other co—coordinator of the Pharmacy
Week events, said, “Pharmacy is a ﬁeld

.,..,;. .. ~~\~<

  

which is undergoing a great deal of
change right now.” P

According to Jennifer Gonos, presi-
dent of the Lambda Kappa Sigma phar-
macy sorority, many pharmacy students
involved in the program hope this week
will serve “to make Pitt students more
aware of the school of pharmacy and
what [they] do.”

The program series, entitled “Team
up and Talk with Your Pharmacist,” is
being presented through the efforts of
many professional organizations within
the school.

All but one of this week’s events will
be held from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the
lower level of the VV1lliam Pitt Union.

The activities kicked off on Monday
with a blood pressure screening and

RSA wants to make life on
campus more comfortable

Rachel Bacheler

 

Trying to overcome what Nick
Lierman, the Resident Student

Association’s executive chair,
describes as “Pitt’s reputation of
an apathetic student body,” the
Resident Student Association
board meets every Friday to
brainstorm exciting events to
bring to Pitt.

Imagine this: Live, from Pitt
Stadium, the Beastie Boys. The
stands are full, students are cheer-
ing, it’s a success.

Imagine this, at the University
of Pittsburgh.

Currently, the Black Action
Society is working in conjunction
with the ‘RSA, to determine which
popular bands would be the best
to bring to Pitt’s stadium.

The Beastie Boys and The
Lost Boys are among those on the
list. According to Lierman,
whether or not the concert
becomes a reality is based on

interest and energy from the stu-
dent body’.

However, according to
Lierman, the RSA’s foremost goal
is to make the residence halls
more attractive and comfortable.
He said that maybe students won’t
be so anxious to move off campus
if things are done right.

This month, the RSA has
planned a “Fall Fest” to kick off
its activities for the year.

Beginning at 6 p.m. on October
29th, a D.J. and well as a band,
will be in Schenley Quad, accom-
panied by beanbag tosses, face
painting, food, and other games.
Following the “Fall Fest” that
same night, Holland Hall will host
its annual Haunted House.

Not all the residence halls are
as well organized this early in the
semester, and Lierman, Tower B
president, said, “we don’t have
much on tap.” He said that the
Towers have trouble getting
events organized because Tower C

“Poison Prevention” booth.
Today the school will be setting up a

_ booth entitled “Spin the Bottle with Your

Pharmacist,” directed at educating stu-
dents about the dangers and precautions
of drug interaction.

Tim Jancel, a pharmacy student help-
ing with the events said the purpose of
today's program is “to educate the patient
more, to let them know they can ask
questions of their pharmacist.”

“Team up and Talk with your
Pharmacist” and “Allergy Medications”
booths will be set up to provide interest-
ed students with information on
Wednesday.

Thursday will bring a program on
diabetes awareness and prevention to the
Union. Carol‘ Bromley, who will be in
charge of the booth, said that “[those run-
ning it] will have little test kits  we’ll do
some prevention things, and go over risk
factors [for diabetes].”

The topic of the ﬁnal booth run by
the school will be “AIDS home tests.”

“We did [the AIDS booth] before,
and we had problems going to get the
information because [students] ﬁgured
everybody thought they had AIDS just
because they got the information,” said
Erin Conley, a Pitt Pharmacy student.
“You can just get [information] to be
aware of the test.”

At the end of the “Team Up and Talk
to Your Pharmacist” week, the pharmacy
school will be hosting an open house
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in Salk Hall.
Students interested‘ in attending will be
provided with an overview of the phar-
macy school curriculum, tours, and
career options for pharmacists.

On Wednesday, there will be a noon

 

Tuesday, October 2 ‘I996

, lecture by Marcia Brand, a representative

from the Bureau of Health Professions, in
lecture Room 6 of Scaife Hall. Brand will
be speaking on the importance of stream-
lining interdisciplinary relations between
healthcare professionals.

“We’d like to get more interaction
between doctors, nurses, and pharma-
cists” said Gonos, “so that we all work
together for a common goal instead of
everyone just doing their own thing.”

Pharmacy is an area of education
which has undergone a considerable
degree of reform in the past several years,
especially here at Pitt. Pitt’s school of
phannacy recently introduced a doctor of
pharmacy degree program when it irnple—
mented its fall 1996 curriculum.

“What we used to got was a B.S. in
pharmacy  [Pitt’s] program offers a
doctorate degree  we want to make peo-
ple educated on these kind of changes,”
said Marci Kropif, a school of pharmacy
student.

The need for better communication
between students and career pharmacists

' is one of the school’s other goals.

“Better communication increases
efficiency and the efficacy of the services
that [pharmacists] try to provide,” said
Gonos.

Conley said the shifting responsibili-
ties of a pharmacist are oifering new
goals and challenges for students study-
ing that ﬁeld.

‘The traditional role of the pharma-
cist is changing rapidly  [we are] in a
difficult time for the profession because
of that change,” Conley said.

This week will be the school of phar-
macy’s chance to convey that to the rest
of Pitt’s academic community.

The study abroad office is explor-
ing new territory on campus by open-
ing an extension in Pitt’s school of
engineering.

“The new office in engineering
serves as a model for professional
schools throughout the University and
is an extension of the study abroad
office in the school of engineering in
B80 Benedum.” said Alicia Olalde,
stfidy abroad advisor.

Pitt has sensed a growing need to
provide the school of engineering with
more support to study abroad. The new
office in Benedum should make it eas-
ier for engineering students to get
assistance and find ways to study
abroad.

“Studying abroad makes our stu-
dents more competitive in the current
job market,” Olalde said. “Students
have an increased understanding of the
culture and the language and the
opportunities are certainly not limited
to the humanities majors -—— it is a
necessity to all students.”

Olalde noted that, “More and more
types of majors are studying abroad
including some from SIS [School of
Information Systems] and CBA
[College of Business Administration].”

Olalde also said that for engineers
one important benefit of an intema—
tional education is they are able to
learn about new styles of learning and
new approaches to engineering.

Engineers also make new contacts

Study abroad office seeks

with other individuals in their field
both competitors and colleagues.

“Some of the study abroad engi-
neering programs include Technion
University in Israel, CPE-Lyon in
France, and programs in Canada,
China, Australia, Denmark and
Monterrey, Mexico,” said Olalde.
“Technion University and CPE -
Lyon are the premier engineering uni-
versities in their countries, so the Pitt
students are really provided with some
very high —-— quality opportunities.”

The programs in Monterrey and in
Canada were started because of the
NAFTA treaty, Olalde said.

Dr. Larry Shuman, associate sean
of the school of engineering, Dr. Jayant
Rajgopal, faculty member in the
school of engineering and others inves-
tigated the courses and program of
study at Monterrey and had found that
the programs were nearly identical to
that at Pitt.

There are presently ten engineers
from the ITESM (Instituto
Technologico y de Estudios Superiores
de Monterrey) at Pitt, and there are two
engineers from Pitt at Monterrey dur-
ing the fall semester.

“The greatest benefit is that stu-
dents gain knowledge and become bet-
ter citizens of the world. The Pitt stu-
dents are ambassadors all around the
world,” said Olalde. “Pitt is taking ini-
tiative to provide this service to the
school of engineering by establishing
an office to help and meet with engi-
neering students interested in studying
abroad.”

The keynote speaker of the after-
noon was Keyne Johnson, a 1996
UNCF—Merck Undergraduate Science
Research Scholar. She has interned at
the neuroscience department at Pitt
since 1993 and was selected in 1995
to participate in an international epi-
demiological research study on dia-
betes at the University of West Indies
in Barbados.

She spoke of the need for the
freshmen to maximize their potential
in order to minimize their problems.
She also told them to “do well in
everything” to get the most out of
their time at Pitt.

“It’s a great accolade for the
University. It shows that they’re
investing in their future. These fresh-
men are leaders and Pitt knows that
they are leaders and their achieve-
ments will reﬂeet on Pitt,” Johnson

Are we driven by the hands of fate?

 

When you are sitting in the
computer lab at four in the morning
cursing at the evils of the demonic
computer spirits, I wonder if you
ponder things. Do you ponder the
meaning of life while you are sitting
in a dorm room at 3 am scarﬁng
down the O’s pathetic (but cheap)
excuse for pizza while doing 1min-
telligible physics problems? As a
gloriﬁed method of procrastination,
Idothisandonoccasion,Idohave
an interesting albeit useless thought
The other day I was wondering
about ﬂee will and determinism, a
hackneyed philosophical problem,
but nonetheless, considerably per-
plexing. Please humor my humble
ramblings...

The idea that the entire future is
planned out, and there’s nothing we
candotochangeit, soundsalittle
ridiculous. Perhaps it is because our
daily life is riddled with choices. For
example, most ofus choose not to
undress and ﬂolic naked through the
aisles of our lecture classes. If we
really wanted to, it is certainly with-
in our domain of power. According
to many, this deterministic idea is
not totally insane.

The purpose of science, espe-
cially physics, seems oddly oriented
towards predicting the futtne. In

. physics, one is often concerned with

the path of particles. Knowing the
initial forces, one can predict a par-
ticle’s future path. Biology and psy-
chology are also stimulus-response
based sciences. If one gave John
Doe (my favorite guinea pig) med-
ication, how will he respond? W111
he get better? Will he lose his lunch?
Wrllhetuminvisibleandceaseto
exist? The primary concern is still
with predicting the future:

The typical determinist asserts
thatifweknewallthescientiﬁcdata
about the entire universe at any one
time, we could, through the
immutable laws of natme, predict
the entire future. IfI had this knowl-
edge,Icouldtellyouifyouwere
going to get drunk next Friday and
dance on the tables at CJ.’s. Even
silly decisions like whether or not
I’m going to turn left could be pre-
dicted. Psychological, situational,
and biological concerns could be
examined Is there an oncoming
car?WheredoIhavetogo?DoI
have some deeply—rooted psycho-
logical predisposition? Maybe the
Catholic school nuns smacked me
ontherightsideofmyheadtoo
much whenlwas young, andIcon-
stantly had to go left to evade the
blows. If one looks at all past expe-
riences, one can invariably ﬁnd
causes for all of them. This might
putaseriouspoisonthomintheside
of free will.

Quantum mechanics and chaos
theory might add something to the
contrary. Quantum mechanics states
that at least on a small level (i.e. real-
ly, really, small) things can only be
described in terms of probability.
On smaller levels, values of a parti-
cle’s momentum can be completely
undetermined. Chaos theory shows
that for some extremely complex
systems, the future is chaotic. I won-
derifthehurnanbrainisone such
system Maybe I wouldn’t feel so
bad about my scatter-brained ideas.

Seriously though, it may be
possible that these properties cas-
cade into more and more uncertain-
ty. Maybe our rational ﬂee will is
taking the reigns of the crazy run-
away horse of nature. Maybe we are

' not merely the stereotypical strand-

ed sailboat completely at the mercy
of the stormy waters of an inﬁnite

ocean. Who knows? But more
importantly  who cares?

'lhis question makes it sound
like I’ve been babbling for nothing.
-IthinkIhavebeen.Wethinkwe
have a choice in matters, whether
we do or not. Neither determinism
nor the existence of a ﬂee will can
be proven, so what are conscien-
tious college students like us to do?
Perhaps wallowing in our agnosti-
cism will help. That is a cheesy
answer.

I think the real answer lies in a
realization that our nature forces us
to believe in ﬂee will. Immanuel
Kant, in “Grounding for the
Metaphysics of Moralsﬁ called
humans “beings who cannot act
otherwise than under the idea of our
own ﬂeedom.” There may be some
truthinthis.IrnagineiftheNew York
Times headline tomonow read
“Determinism is true, we are at the
hands of Fate!” Would one choose
to reject all morality in favor of
instant gratiﬁcation because one
could say “It was my fate”? Oops,
how could we choose anything, ﬂee
will doesn’t exist. And besides, what
would we do with criminals? Can
you imagine a drunk driver? “I’m
thorryocifenltwuzmyfatetokill
those innothent people.” “OK sir, be
on your way, chive safely, and watch
out for those trees.” I don’t think so.

It is our nature as human beings
tothinkthatwehaveafreewill.A
world in which we didn’t believe in
ﬂee will is extremely silly. So this
philosophical tirade (like most) was
fairly useless, but maybe I’ll rest
better knowing that it’s pointless to
worry about such things. Or maybe
I’ll just be so exasperated from
thinking I’ll pass out and have pleas-
ant dreams.

Jay DeMartino thinks that freedom
is our fate.

 

Are we Zips,
Panthers, or
Tarheels?

 

During the 1995-96 school year, Pitt
did not win a single conference champi-
onship. The way things are going this
fall, that won’t change anytime soon.

Things are getting desperate, and
that requires desperate action. Pitt needs
to consider a new name. When was the
last time any team named the Panthers
won anything?

It’s time for Pitt to step into the ‘90s,
when sports teams change names and
logos as often as players change under-
wear. Besides, in a conference full of
Hokies, Orangemen, and Hoyas, the only
thing the Pitt Panthers have going for
them is alliteration. As a public service, I
will walk through the name selection
process.

We’ll keep our school colors so that
the athletic department doesn’t have to
go deeper into debt by splurging on new
uniforms. That makes especially good
sense when you consider that uniform
aesthetics is one area where Pitt is a con-
ference leader.

Since professional teams from
Carolina and Florida have stolen our
name, let’s look at some successful pro
names to steal back. The 1995 (and soon
to be 1996) World Series champs, the
Braves, have a name that is too political-
ly incorrect for college. Cowboys is too
southern a name for Pittsburgh, and the
NI-IL-charnpion Avalanche is quite sim-
ply too dumb for any team. The most
interesting option lies in copying the
NBA champions. Being the Pitt Bulls
would add an entirely new dimension to
that nickname, but in terms of originality,
Bulls really isn’t much better than
Panthers.

College teams are known for odd,
unmistakable, original nicknames. When
you hear “Crimson Tide”, you think of
Alabama. The same holds true with
teams like the Tarheels or the Buckeyes.

Youth and experience
guided Pitt to victory as
the volleyball team took
out Big East enemy
Syracuse and non-confer-
ence opponent Buffalo on
the road last weekend.

Pitt (13-8, 3-0 Big
East) played through
seven hard—fought games
in the past two days en
route to victories over the
Orangewomen (15-11,
10-15, 15-11 and 15-12)
and a sweep of the Lady
Bengals (15-10, 15-13
and 15-8).

Senior—standout
Jennie Driscoll and fresh-
man Peggy Meinhart led
Pitt to both wins with a
combined 51 kills and a
.402 attack percentage.

“Peggy [Meinhart]

and Jennie [Driscoll] car-
ried us this weekend,”
said Head Coach Cindy
Alvear. “Peggy sort of
turned a corner for us.”

Meinhart was sensa-
tional, firing 21 spikes in
addition to one block and
12 block assists. With 58
block assists and an aver-
age of .91 blocks per
game, both second-best
stats-on the team, things
are finally looking up for
the Pitt freshman. _

“Peggy said that it’s
almost like the light bulb
had indeed gone on,”
Alvear said, laughing.
“She said that things are
finally beginning to make
sense to her.”

Driscoll was on fire
this weekend as well. The
senior hit a team—high 30

“You’d think that peo-

her,” Alvear said, “but it

Men's soccer sinks Number 6 Rutgers

_atric.k.R°b¢rtson.- , - .    . I‘ ,

The Pitt men’s soccer team went on the
road last weekend trying to turn things
around. They returned with a 1-0-1 record,
including a win over nationally-ranked
Rutgers.

The Panthers traveled to Vrllanova on
Friday for a Big East matchup. The game
ﬁnished in a 3-3 deadlock

Pitt opened the scoring at 3:30 when
Dean Astorino booted his fourth goal of the
season off a pass from Bret Stezoski. This
began the see-saw battle. Vrllanova
responded with a goal ﬁom Mike Paskey at
38:40 to knot the game at one.

Pitt recaptured the lead at 74:00 when
ﬁeshman Bill Hicks scored off an assist
from Mike Dyer. This lead did not last long
as Vrllanova bounced right back to tie it on
a late goal by Paul Miraglia This goal
came at 84:38 and sent the game to over-
time.

The Panthers made their move in the
ﬁrst overtime when sophomore Phil
Matilla scored on an Astorino assist.

Pitt held onto its lead for almost 20
minutes until Villanova capped otf the scor-

Men's soccer will play California
University of Pa. this Wednesday
at 7:15 p.m. at Pitt Stadium.

Correll netted the tying goal at 13:20 oif an
assist from Conor Porter.

The offensive star of the game was
Pitt’s Astorino with three points.
V1llanova’s goalkeeper Kevin McCuhan

faced 14 shots and made ﬁve saves.

Pitt has defeated top—20 Rutgers
(ranked number six at the time) three
straight times. Pitt swept the season series
from the Scarlet Knights last season. This
time, Rutgers was looking for a win, but
Pitt had different ideas and pulled off a big
upset to earn its ﬁrst conference win of the
season.

Late in the ﬁrst half, Pitt junior Matt
Gray scored his second goal of the season,
and it turned out to be the eventual game
winner. Adam Spitzer, Pitt’s goaltender,
lowered his goals against average to 1.84 in
the fourth win of the Panthers’ season.

For most of the season, the soccer team
has felt they’ve been talented enough to
win, but hadn’t found the right combination
tmtil the Rutgers game.

Sophomore Drew Kopp said, “I was-
n’t really surprised we won. We have the
potential to beat anyone, and we ﬁnally
proved it.”

The Panthers have one conference
game remaining, which leaves them a
rniniscule chance of making the Big East
tournament Three of their last four games
are at home, on Oct. 23 and 30 and Nov. 3.

Kopp summed up the Panthers’ season
thus far by saying, “It’s been disappointing,
but we really want to end on a good note.”

Football

- The Cincinnati Bengals are starting
over. The team fired Head Coach
David Shula yesterday and replaced
him with Offensive Coordinator
Bruce Coslet. Shula finished with
one of the NFL’s all—time worst
coaching records, 19-52, in four—plus
seasons.

The Shula era ended with four
consecutive losses including yester-
day’s 28-21 defeat, in which the
Bengals blew a 21-0 lead in San
Francisco.

The 50-year-old Coslet is in his
second tour of duty on the Bengals’
coaching staff. He is a former New
York Jets head coach and onetime
Bengals tight end.

continued her superb senior season
with 10 kills, 16 digs, four block
assists and a team-high 101 assists.
The setter is tops on the squad with
916 assists.

With 10 matches remaining
before the Big East Tournament,
Dufresne has moved within 736
assists of Pitt’s all—time single sea-
son assist record of 1,652, held by
Jenelle Lantagne. Dufresne finished
last season with 1,228 helpers.

Unfortunately, the weekend did

j not go as well for first-year hitter

Paula Zemrowski. The Michigan
native struggled through both victo-
ries, mustering a mere eight kills in
five games. She finished the week-
end with a .030 kill percentage,
both season lows.

“We tried her a little on the left
side and a little on the right,” said
Alvear of Zemrowski. “If she’s not
hitting the ball, she won’t be on the
court.”

NOTICE TO ALL STUDENTS
ENROLLED IN CAS COURSES

DEADLINE FOR W GRADES

Students enrolled in CAS courses who
wish to withdraw without credit or
penalty must fill out a form in the CAS
Dean’s Ofﬁce, Room 140 Thackeray

MUST MEET WITH AN ADVISOR
OR CAS DEAN BEFORE
WITHDRAWING FROM ANY

THIS DEADLINE WILL BE
OBSERVED

 

Alvear

explained that
Zemrowski is extremely talented
when it comes to hitting up front.
But the 6-foot-5 hitter is still devel-
oping her passing and setting skills.

Pitt heads back out on the road
again this weekend to face confer-
ence rivals Boston College and
Providence before returning home
to host Robert Morris on “Mischief
Night,” Oct. 30. While the Lady
Friars and Eagles are not formida-
ble foes, the Panthers will prepare
just as hard for the upcoming
matches.

“We’re going to jump in with
both feet and go really hard,”
Alvear explained. ‘‘We’ll go
through repetitions, some one—on—
ones plus make some [small]
changes to the defense. It’s that
‘young team’ syndrome. One day
things are going well and the next
you’re back to square one, but
we’re winning through it all.”

But there is a downside.

For every team like the Fighting
Irish, there are teams out there like the
Tulane Green Wave, the Kent Golden
Flashes, or the Akron Zips. If a name
is to be a source of pride to us, it
shouldn’t be a source of ridicule to
everyone else. There is a very thin line
between stupid nicknames that are full
of tradition and stupid nicknames that
are just plain stupid, and most of the
stupid ones fall into the latter catego-

ry.

In college sports, when you think
of Panthers, Pitt is the only major team
that comes to mind. Sure, schools like
Northern Iowa call themselves
Panthers, but who cares? What have
they ever done? Our Panthers have the
tradition that the Nittany Lions have,
and a much better name. Being better
than Penn State in something is reason
enough to stick with what we have.

Geoff Moak is thinking of changing
his name to Bubby.

Landing your first job is the hard part. Once you get into a corporation,
you know you can prove yourself.

So what can you do to set yourself apart from all of those other college
graduates? join the advertising staff of The Pitt News. Year after year our staff
members start promising careers after they graduate (many have offers even
before they finish their last semester.) Some of the companies that currently
employ alumni from our sales staff include IBM, Ketcbum Advertising,
Andersen Consulting, GQ Magazine, MCI, Merle, Bristol Meyers, and Pfizer.

If you’re interested in getting the experience that these successful
corporations require, you need to start working as an account executive or
advertising staff member for The Pitt News.

For more information and an application, see Natalie D’Antonio
in room 426 of the William Pitt Union.
