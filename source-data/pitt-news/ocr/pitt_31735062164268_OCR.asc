Curb Shaving

Begins Soon

On Campus

By Josey Grossman
Editorial, “Qualiﬁed Success,”
page 4.

The University has con-
tracted Joseph J. Graziano,
Graziano Construction Com-
pany, Inc., to shave curbs
for Wheelchair students at
three points on the main campus
as soon as possible.

Assistant Chancellor of Stu-
dent and General Affairs Alan C.
Rankin revealed Wednesday that
the contract had been made’ a
couple_ weeks ago to cut curbs
on both sides of Fifth Avenue in
front of Clapp Hall and at the
Bigelow Boulevard entrance to
the Cathedral directly across
from the Student Union drive-
way. J

General maintenance funds

will absorb the $2,650 cost for
the three cuts. Two temporary
wooden ramps connecting steps
on the first ﬂoor of the Cathe-
dral have also been ordered,
with the estimated cost of about
$200 a piece coming from the
Student Affairs budget.

This construction realizes the
goal set by the Committee on the
Handicapped during the spring
trimester which met to increase
independent mobility around the
campus for wheelchair students.
As a result of the Committee's
initial efforts, handles were se-
cured to the outside of the ﬁre
doors at the Lily Court entrance
to. the Cathedral, the only en-
trance a wheelchair student can
manage without going up or down
steps. Dr. Rankin also appointed
his administrative assistant Frank
Callanen as a special advisor to
the handicapped for any prob-
lems, such as scheduling classes
on ﬂoors where the elevator does
not stop.

Smoker Opens Rush

‘.

ED STACK explains the features. of his fraternity to rushee Bob
Laurenzane during the IF Smoker Wednesday evening. Nearly 500
rushees turned out despite evening classes and a Jewish holiday.
Registration for rush continues through September 23.

Interfraternity Council opened a week-long registration period
Wednesday evening in the Student Union Ballroom when nearly 500
rushees turned out for the annual fraternity smoker.

Parker lmiwright, assistant dean of men and IFC advisor, noted
that evening labs and the Jewish holiday cut into opening-night at-
tendance. He predicted, however, that many of these students would
register during the coming week.

The smoker began with brief talks about the beneﬁts of the fra-
ternity system. Jack Koury of Delta Tau Delta, chairman of the cen-
tral rush committee, told the gathering that fraternities offer a student
an opportunity to ﬁnd an identity in the large enrollment of a
University.

High Scholastically

He added that scholastically, fraternity members are achieving

better averages than non-fraternity students.

IFC president Norm Himes of Sigma, Chi said that the turn-
out was an indication of the growing popularity of the fraternity
system.

Enwright added that since last fall’s rush, “the fraternities have
had a very positive year.” He explained that the University is behind
the fraternity idea and “recognizes fully the positive force that they
can exert on the campus.” '

Anyone who missed the smoker may sign up for fall rush in the
Dean of Men’s Office.

‘No Exceptions’ on Receipt Deadline

Book Exchange Concludes Successful Sale

The Student Book Exchange, which closed a ﬁve day

' °hanE¢- adding.» annotlner successful service gto»*SG annals.

 

JERRY HOGAN. SG book exchange chairman, unscrambles boxes of
receipts in an attempt to organize an efficient refund system. Over
800 books sold for approximately $1,800 during the ﬁve day ex-

‘   sale last Wednesday, was one of the most successful ex-

changes ever sponsored by the Student Government, stated
Jerry Hogan, President pro tempore of the Student Gov-
ernment Senate and this year’s Chairman of the exchange.

Over 800 books worth approxi-
mately $1,800 were sold during
the course of the exchange with
10% feet of adding machine tape
needed to tally the sales.‘ These
books represented about 80 per
cent of the total books turned in
for the sale.

“Considering the number of
text requirements that were
changed this term,” said Hogan,
“this is a fantastic sale.”

Nonproﬁt Project ,

A service charge of 10 cents a
book was levied to cover the cost
of the sales receipts. The project
itself is run on a nonproﬁt basis
with any surplus being used on
advertising the exchange for nxet
trimester.

“The exchange was well ac-
cepted by the students,” Hogan

= 5  ‘-‘Most of the stu-

dents who participated in the
sale wanted to see it expanded
or enlarged,” he added.

Presently the SG is organizing
an “efficient refund system” for
the purpose of distributing the
receipts and returning unsold
books back to their owners.

Refunds Start Tiiesday

Money and books may be claim-
ed in 306 Schenley Hall on Tues-
days, September 22 and 29, from
9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and on Thurs-
day, September 24, from 10 a.m.
to 3 p.m.

Wednesday, September 30, will
be the last day to redeem books
or money. “Anyone holding re-
ceipts after this might as well
burn them,” Hogan stated with
authority. “Absolutely no excep-

General Studies’ Community Series of Informal Courses
Satisfies Desire of Adults for Continued Se1f—Development

- By DEVRA LEE DAVIS

Learning is a continuous process; one which does not
stop when the yearly tuition bill drops into oblivion. The
University’s Community Series of informal courses and lec-
tures seeks to satisfy the desire among adults’ “for con-
tinued self-development, and for an increased understand-
ing of the world and its problems.”

Jane Wood-Smith, assistant to the Dean of the School

of General Studies, considers the
increasing enrollment in these

1 courses strong evidence that “the

need for the renewal of liberal
skins, ‘attitudes, and habits is
constant.” ’

Miss Woodasmith cited a 1953

Business School
Undergraduate
Program Ending

Undergrduates now in the
School of Business who fail to
complete their business require-
ments by April, 1965, cannot
graduate from the University
with a bachelor’s degree in busi-
ness.

H. Jerome Zoﬂer, assistant
dean for academic affairs in the
Graduate School of Business,
stressed that after that date the
undergraduate program in busi-
ness will end. Should an under-
graduate fail to reach the re-

» quired number of credits to grad-

uate, he said, there will be no
make-up opportunity.

Said Dr. Zoffer,
some business subjects will be
given in the School of General
Studies, they cannot be used to
complete a bachelor’s degree in»
business after April of 1965.”

If .a student cannot meet the
requirements by April, he added,
“the alternative open is to trans-

fer credits immediately to an- _
' other school in the University or

to another University.”

“Althou gh '

report on adult liberal arts educa-
tion to explain the public’s inter-
est in non-credit courses: “The
need for education develops,
both as a means of seli-expres-
sion and fulﬁllment within the
individual, and as a defense
against the distortion of values
and humiliation of the human
spirit through which a mechani-
zed, propagandized, industrial-
ized, materialistic society must
ﬁnd its way to a meaningful lite.”
Enrollment Encouraged

The School of General Studies
encourages , enrollment in these
courses in several ways. Any one

over 65 may enroll for $3; mar-
ried couples also are granted re-
duced rates. , The enticement,
however, is more than a mone-
tary bonus.

As the report adds, the adults
both require and expect a
stimulus from without; but
once they receive this, they
respond by imposing upon
themselves their own stimulus
from within. Thus the program
nut provide not only recrea-
tion, but stimulation as well.

To quite adequately ﬁll these
requirements, the University pro-

vides more than -20 professors. .

and assistant professors to spark
31 courses, whose topics vary
from gourmet wine to classical
mythology, irom the Soviet Union
to the 1964 election, and from
conversational Italian to busi-
ness English.

Jazz FéVora lily    

A   Compared With  

Classical Music

. By Larry Bernfeld ,
‘.‘Jazz and rock-and-roll are not music,” the distin-
guished science professor remarked perfunctorily. “It is
”'-music for the body and the feet, and it all sounds the

‘_ ' same.”

 . I I had heard this argument many times before. It
represents the value judgment of a large group of classi-
{cists who hold jazz and rock-and-roll in disrepute because
these musical idioms do not “attain nor approach the

criteria of good music.”

- I took the professor’s
 statement as a challenge.
* ’ Ha vi'n g a

ing affinity
toward both
of these mu-
sical modes,

that given the
the opprtun-

 WHAT ARE THE cri-

is a word heavily laden with
gsemantics. Throughout the
[ages it has been culturally
deﬁned and redefined. The

 _ Later, when checking my

. should have been the same.

A-. At—_that point a horrible sus-

picion entered my mind. I

It all start-
ed with one
tiny mistake .

, i “I’M AFRAID that is im'-

 

ments. But can this music
be so glibly pushed aside?
Culture is not static and
neither i's taste. A brief ex-
amination of the trends
within “classical” music it-
self will reveal that ever
since music has become a
significant art form, com-
posers and musicians peri-
odically have introduced
new developments in music-
al style that have offended
the traditionalist’s sense of
good music.

The formal and predom-
inately diatonic structure of
Bach, Mozart and other
composers of the “classical”
period gave Way to the
warm, beauty - conscious
form of the romantics. Yet
the freer, chromatic style
of this later period did not
win the immediate approval
of its audiences. The initial
performances of Tchaikov-
sky’s works serve as a case
in point. At ﬁrst received
with coldness, if not open
hostility, the Russian com-
poser’s symphonies won
great acclaim in later years.

Part two will deal with the
basic characteristics which dis-
tinguish iazz as a musical form,
with the void which . it serves
to ﬁll, and with the social fac-
tors which in reality underlie
much of the criticism directed
towards jazz as music.

conﬁrmed. The number on

I asked worriedly.

lance, the clerk replied, "I
really don't know, but I
-wouldn’t worry about it if I
were you.”

For a while I took the
clerk's advice and forgot
about the situation. But then
I received an invitation to
join the Society of Women
Engineers, which set off a
chain of events.

At that point I only knew
that I was supposed to be an
engineering student; I had
no idea what kind of engi-
neering. I discovered that
quite accidentally. I had to
call the electrical engineer-
ing department for the Pitt
News. When I gave the sec-
retary my name, she replied:
“Oh yes, you are one of. the
students in our department.”

‘(I am?”

“I have your name right
here on my list.”

‘_‘But I'm an English ma-
jor," I protested.

~ an engineer was ludicrous.

 

V c The Committee on the Handicapped and especially itschairman, aslsistant Chan-if 

- cellor Alan _Rankin, should be congratulated for effecting the long awaited curb cuts

for Wheelchair students. Top on the priority list for modifications that would ease
mobility around the campus for the handicapped, the cuts were delayed mainly be-
cause of finances. But now‘ ‘thatthe general maintenance fund has absorbed the cost,
the Committee has succeeded in its aims. ‘

The significance of the victory lies in two areas. First, naturally, the accomp-
lishment of plans to help the Wheelchair students. And secondly, an effective co-
operation between the members of a student, faculty, and administrative committee.

The first victory was not so easy because of technical problems. But the
second was difficult in a different way because it involved personalities, personal-
ilities of groups that are not used to working with one another and at some times
not used to trusting one another. ‘ _,

We must remember through all ofthis that the three groups of people who
worked on this»Committee were primarily concerned with the Welfare of’ the handi-
capped students. The discussions they had this summer were deep, concerned ones,
and they made several small modifications immediately. But the test as to their ulti-
mate success was the curb cuts, because of the size and financial implications of the V
project. Since thegroup had worked so closely this summer, Dr. Rankin told the
Committee at its last meeting that they would meet to see the final technical plans
before they were submitted to the City for approval.

This was the last the Committee heard of the plans.

By the middle of September, the students began to Wonder if‘ they would ever
be called for this meeting, as we described in our last editorial. As far as they could
see, the Committee was a test rocket for student inclusion in such a project and
they did not Want to be grounded.

At the same time, Dr. Rankin and Captain Liles Creighton of the Physical
Plant had efficiently concluded the financial and contracting setup, but because of
the rush of the beginning of the term had notnotified the rest of the Committee.

In a telephone conversation Wednesday, Dr. Rankin explained this rush, but
noted that a meeting of‘ the Committee to approve the plans would have been a
waste of time since they could see the" progress in the pavement for themselves.

The students Waited in vain for a phone call. The administration called us
down for jumping to conclusions. The beginning of such a co-operation is bound to
be rough. We’re only glad the handicapped students have their curb cuts.

“THE THIRD ADVERSARY

INEXPERIENCE and a rugged schedule wi‘ll plague the
‘Panther football team all season. But now they have en-
encountered -another obstacle, one unforeseen by most

- football fans. That new obstacle, the substitution rule,

also stands between the Panthers and a winning

season. -
The new rule passed by the National Collegiate

Athletic Association (NCAA) beneﬁts the Panthers

I: like pollen benefits a farmer writh hay fever.

‘ BASICALLY. the new rule provides free substitution

9 any time the clock is stopped. This means an entire unit

A can besent into a game after a penalty, a punt, an
incomplete pass, a time out for a measurement, or a
time out for a television commercial. ,

When the clock is not stopped," a team can send
in two substitutes at a time without being charged
for a time-out.

V According to Panther backfield coach Lou
“Bimbo” Cecconi, the new ruling will beneﬁt the
teams with the big squads. Those are the teams that
will be able to play separate units of offensive and
defensive specialists. Teams like Army, Navy, Texas,

- Syracuse, UCLA, and USC will beneﬁt from the rul-
ing. They will be able to have fresh ballpayers in the

game at all times.

“The ruling will bring back free substitution in
college,” Cecconi explained. “And they'll make a farce_

‘ out of the rule at the same time.” It's hardly differ-

ent from unlimited free substitution, “The only rea-
son we-vdon’t have that is because we don’t want to
be the same as the pros, but I can’t see where it’s

 . much different now.”

. - THE NEW RULING particularly‘ favors the service

* academies. “Those teams have men coming out of their

 3~__ ; \ ears," Cecconi said. “T:hey’1l be able to go with three

‘ solid units: an offense, a defense, and a two-way team.”

Fans who saw the Panther-UCLA game can al-
ready see some consequences of the new ruling. Bruin
  . coach Bill Barns took advantage of the new ruling to
7:1;  . alternate his units‘ on punting situations. By taking
 j'i~ j too much time to call the play, they draw a ﬁve-yard
  penalty. At this point, while the clock is stopped,

Barns can send in a fresh unit to play defense.

V Some fans doubted the advantage of losing ﬁve
yards to change teams. Barns explained it this may:
“Losing ﬁve yards when you’re punting means almost
nothing. It doesn’t matter too much whether the
opponent has the  on the 15 or the 20 yard line.
We _ﬁ8‘0!‘9 WE’l‘e gaming «those five yards back just by

;:__ having a fresh unit in-there.”

 "THE PANTHERS did not follow the same procedure

 . -with changing teams. “We can’t do that,” Coach Miche-

 losen explained. “We just don’t have the material

' for two complete units.”

Cecconi feels that the new substitution rule will
also breed a new type of college football player, the
specialist. “College scouts used to look for the big
complete football player,” Cecconi said. “Now scouts
will look for specialists in high school. They'll take
one boy just because he’s big and slow for one" job,
and another because they can use him for a defensive
safety. '

“We don’t play specialists here,” Cecconi con-
tinued. “We liked to look for the complete football
_ player. Now we won’t have to.”

‘ S0 NOW, in addition to having inexperience and a rough

schedule working against them, the Panthers have an-
other obstacle to overcome: the rulebook.

get ‘his timing down and start

moving the team steadily if the
Panthers are to have any success
against Oregon or any future op-
ponent. The team seemed to move
in spurts against UCLA and this
will have to be worked on.

The scrimmage will also de-
cide if any changes will be
made in the starting lineup
next week. Probably the right
halfback spot will see the stiff-
est competition because of the
experience of Bill Bodle and
his pass catching ability. The
Panther receivers weren't sure
handed enough against the
Bruins and Bodle could stab-
ilize the ﬁrst unit.

Although coach Leo Bemis
feels that the soccer team
will be improved when it

1 plays at Frostburg State Col-

lege tomorrow, the problem
is that Frostburg will also
have an improved team.
“Frostburg was rather
green last year, since they
had few seniors and little
experience. They did ﬁnish strong

1 last year, however, and with an

experienced squad, they'll be
much better this season,” said
Bemis.

Of its eleven starters, Frost-
burg will have seven lettermen.
According to Bemis, “Their en-
tire offensive line consists of
lettermen and they've got a good

 center halfback in Jim Broad-

water.” Frostburg has two other
good players in center forward
Bill Kinton and Al Chaney, an
inside lineman.

t1eBe1stered pron.

  

Frostburg not only has a more
experienced squad‘ this year, but
they will be up for Pitt. “Their
schedule consists mainly of small
schools, and therefore Pitt is a
big game on their schedule. If
they can defeat us, it would give
them the impetus for a winning
season,” said Bemis.

Bemis is still uncertain about
his strategy against Frostburg,
because he still has several prob-
lems. Aldo Zortea, the starting
right wing, is recovering from a
pulled hamstring, and Bemis is
not certain whether he'll be in
top shape for the game.

both former Yogi champions, return this year to defend
their titles against a hostof challengers. Among the chal-

“Sage” Smizik, the 1962 cham-
pion, slumped to sixth place last
year, but is determined to im-
prove his record. “Last year I
gave ‘Isaiah’ the crown,” the Sage
remarked, “This year, however,
and mark my word, I shall be un-
merciful in my "picks, and lead‘
from the first week to the last. I

will return to the throne room.

I’ left in 1962.

But lo, the words of the Sage
have not discouraged “Isaiah.”
The prophet. who last year
rode his ﬂaming chariot to the
top of the Yogi standings, smiled
.a benevolent smile when he
heard the words of the Sage.
Then he spoke: “Lo, I have
many suns and many moons
since the last football season,
but my Adviser's Voice hath’
only been slightly dulled. And
behold, I have a further edge
on the Sage. My bad week is
already out of my system” . . . .

“Isaiah” picked the Panthers
to defeat UCLA, 26-0.

Perhaps the strongest chal-
lenger to the above prophets is
“Hot Lips” Grossman. “Last year
I was the only one to have a
perfect score,” she said. “Even

 for Burt Lancaster. It told Hemingway’s brief episode in stark, real-
