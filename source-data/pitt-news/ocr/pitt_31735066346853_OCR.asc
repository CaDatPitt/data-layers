Tracing ‘Highly Difficult Task”

Calls Remain Mystery

A Captain Charles Ray of

Monday afternoon that “no investigation of the so—called ‘

the University ‘Police stated

mysterious phone calls to Schenley Hall is being planne

by the force at this time.”

Concerning the calls, which have been placed nightly to
the sixth and seventh floors of Schenley throughout the ‘last

term and well into the present tri-
mester, Captain Ray added that
“tracing phone calls has become a
highly difficult task in recent years.

“In the old days, when phone
calls were processed by switch-
board operators, it was relatively
simple to trace a phone call,” he
continued. “However, with all the
automatic methods today, tracing
a call is highly complicated. It's
also a slow process, and the phone-
pest has to be kept on the line
all that time, which isn’t too easy.”

Mysterious Caller

The mysterious caller who has
been bothering the residents of
Schenley is considered by the stu-
dents involved to be a nian im-
personating the voice of a woman.

Several of the students, who
ﬁnally attempted to have the
caller traced last week, told
Pitt News reporters that the
“voice” asked for different stu-
dents by name and then arranged
for meetings in secluded areas
near campus.

Captain Ray, who had received
an oﬁicial report from one of his
officers, stated that “if suchcallers
aren’t encouraged, they usually
end their annoying game.”

The Police Captain then added
that he had received reports of
University personnel receiving ob-
scenity over the phone in the past,
and that usually such behavior
did not continue very long.

“The difficulty of the matter,"
he explained, “is that you have to
apprehend the offender with the
telephone. in his hand. This, of
course, is practically impossible

in charge of Regional Operations,
listed some of the factors under
consideration for the study. '

“Important are the number of
high school graduates who would
be available for and interested in
a community college,” he said, “as
well as the availability of already
existing educational facilities in
the communities.” _ ,

Dr. Geise hoted that “the inter-
est of the community and the
needs of local public schools and
local industry for graduate work at
the master’s level” is also being

_ The objectives for a commun-
ity college would be a two year
curriculum offering the first four
terms in ‘liberal arts and Eng-
lish. .
Included ‘in plans would, be
semi-professional technical train-

and evenings.

As vice chancellor, Dr. Geise is
concerned with the development of
educational opportunities in West-
ern Pennsylvania and liason work
with various federal agencies that
are concerned with education.

Ivory Is Out

“The ivory tower conception of
a university is out,” Dr. Geise em-
Dhasized. “Co-operation between
various schools and various agen-
—cies is essential because of the
great amounts of money that are
dealt with.”

He said that much administra-
tive detail is involved in requests
for research funds. He cited a.
hypothetical example of a re-
quest for research funds going
to one federal agency that ini-
tially shows no interest in the
project. It could happen that
aﬂ0thel' agency would be inter-re
ested.

Dr. Geise said that later the ﬁrst
agency might decide to underwrite
the research and, eventually, a
contract would be signed involving
both agencies.

ROTC Colonel Wolf
Assigned to Germany

BY BERNIE TRUMPOWER

Lieutenant Colonel Paul B.
Wolff, Professor of Military Science
and Tactics, recently received no-
tice that he is being transferred to
Germany.

While at the University, he ini-
tiated The Cadet Handbook, “A
source of information for those

questions cadets often won’t ask.”.

Also during Colonel Wolff’s assign-
ment to the University an orienta-
tion weekend for cadets preparing
to go to six week summer camp
has been started.

Colonel Wolff commented, “No
one truly appreciates the physical
and mental maturing of students
unless they have the chance to see
it take place. During my four
years here at Pitt 1 have been able
to follow the progress of cadets
from their freshman orientation
through their senior year.”

Also Carried

The Colonel has‘ also carried on
correspondence with various col-
leges in referenceto the ROTC
program under the trimester plan.
He feels that Military Science
courses should be offered during
the spring trimester so that cadets
may not be hampered in earning

their commission as well as their

diploma.

In reference to his stay at the
University he said, “It is a
unique experience in my career
as a professional soldier.” A
father of two sons, one in ﬁfth
grade, the other a sophomore in
college, Colonel Wolff comment-
ed concerning declining enroll-
ment in ROTC, “The memory of
World War II is still present,
but it is not quite as fresh.”

He added, “Engineering and

" pharmacy s t u d e n t s encounter

schedule problems which make it

I ditﬁcult for them. to enroll in our

program.”

A native of Greensburg and a
graduate of the University as well
as various government schools,
Colonel Wolff first served as a
Range Officer at a battery Seacoast
Artillery, after which he was as-
signed to Fort Eustis, Va. as a
Battalion Adjutant and ‘later as a
Group Personnel Officer.

With the expansion of Anti-

‘Aircraft Artillery, Colonel Wolﬁ

attended the Automatic Weapons

.. Course at Camp Davis, N.C. Fol-

lowing his training in that ﬁeld he
was assigned to an Anti—Aircraft
Artillery Brigade.
Moved to England
Later he was moved to England

‘as part of an advance party for

the move to Europe. He served
combat duty in France, Belgium,

\Ho1land and Germany in defense
'. of forward airﬁelds on the Ninth

Air Force.

The invasion of Japan moved
\’I’olff along‘ with his unit to the
Far East. His unit was among
the first to be moved from
Europe to Japan. After‘com-

pleting his tour of the Far East,
Colonel Wolff served as Execu-
tive Officer of the Harbor De-
fenses of New York City and
Fort Hancock, New Jersey. A

After serving as an Intelligence

Officer on Okinawa he moved to

Fort Bliss, Texas and from there
to Karlsruhe, Germany with his

The Panther golf team failed
to break its season-long losing

vious nine dual matches. Loss
number ten came with a score
of 41/; to 21/2. .

Neil Shorthousel’ tied St. Vin-
cent’s Mike Johnson, each player
carding a 79 ‘over Holiday Acres’
par 72 course. Ed Wicknick, Pitt’s
number two man, shot an 82, but
it was not good enough to top his
opponent’s 79. Dick McBride, with
an 81, was the only other Panther
victor. E ‘

Pitt’s fourth and fifth-ranked
players, Bob McSorley and Lan-
ny McCoullock, failed to add
those needed points to the team
total. McSorley did manage to tie
his man, aiding the Panther cause
somewhat. St. Vincent won the
sixth match by forfeit, as a sixth

LPenn State Games GoDown Drain

Lions Heavy Card

Prevents Make-Up

By BOB SMIZIK

Chances of the Panther baseball team being selected for
the NCAA District 2 p1ay—ofTs were all but dismissed Monday
morning when Coach Bobby Lewis received a» c-all from
Penn State notifying him that the Lions would be unable to
replay last Saturday’s rained-out double-header.

Lewis had hoped to play the game today but the Lions

had to beg off since they play at
Delaware tomorrow and intend to

leave for that engagement this

afternoon.
Since the Selection Committee is

meeting tomorrow the Panthers
needed two wins over Penn State
to please them. Their present 9-5

record does not promise to ‘draw

that much

attention from the

Chances Fade
According
baseball coach at Colgate Univer-
sity and Chairman of the Selection
Committee, “Pitt’s chances dimin-
ished greatly when their double-
header with Penn State was rained
out. If they had beaten Penn State
twice they would have been prime
contenders for a play-off spot, but
now I don’t think so.”
'O’Hora believed that three of
the spots in the play-offs are up
for grabs, between four teams
with the other place going’ to the
winner of the Mid-Atlantic Con-
ference, which appears to be
Gettysburg. V
“Ithaca, 9 Seton Hall, St. Johns
and Penn State look like the chief
contenders for the play-offs,”_ the
Committee head noted.
Ithaca has a 14-0 record, St.
Johns, at last glance, was 18-1,

If Penn State makes the tourna-

the weatherman- Due to the rain
the Lions did not have to face
West Virginia and its outstanding
pitcher Tom Shafer. 1

State got another break from
the weather last Saturday when
they were scheduled to meet
Pitt. Their ace, Bob Fenton had
pitched eight innings the previ-

With the play-offs out of reach

CRAM COURSE N0. 5: SHAKESPEARE

Continuing-our series of pre—ﬁna.l exam. cram courses, today We
take up the works of William Shakespeare (‘or “The Bard of
Avon” as he is jocularly called). 1

First let us examine the persistent theory that Slia.kespeare
(or “The Pearl of the Antilles” as he is aifectionately referred
to) is not the real author of his plays. Advocates of this theory
insist that the plays are so full of classical allusions and learned
references that they couldn’t»possibly have been written by
the son of an illiterate country butcher.

To which I reply, “Faugh!” Was not the great Spinoza’s

father a humble woodcutter? Was not the immortal Isaac .

Newton’s father a simple second baseman? (The elder Newton,
incidentally, is one of history’s truly pathetic ﬁgures. He was,
by all accounts, the greatest second baseman of his time, but
baseball, alas, had not yet been invented.) It used to break
young Isaac’s heart to see his father get up every morning, put
on uniform, spikes, glove, and cap, and stand alertly behind
second base, bent forward, eyes narrowed, waiting, waiting,
waitiiig. That’s all—wa.iting. Isaac loyally sat in the bleachers
and yelled, “Good show, Dad!” and stuff like that, but every-
one else in town used to snigger and pelt the Newtons with
overripe fruit—ﬁgs for the elder Newton, apples for the yo11i'1ger.
Thus, as we all know, the famous occasion came about when
Isaac Newton, struck in the head with an apple, leapt to his
feet, shouted, “Europa!” and announced the third law of
motion: “For every action there is an opposite and equal
reaction I" c

(How profoundly true these simple words are! Take, for
example, Marlboro Cigarettes. Light one. That's the action.
Now what is the reaction‘? Pleasure, delight, contentment, cheer,

' and comfort! And why such a happy reaction? Because you have

  

  

f"?E2z! agaz/, 271'/2%,

started with a happy cigarette-a felicitous blend of jolly to- A

baccos, a good-natured ﬁlter, a rollicking ﬂip-top box, a merry
soft pack. As Newton often said, “You begin with ' better
makin’s, you end with better smokin’s.” Small wonder they
called him “The Swedish Nightinga.le!”). A

But I digress. Back to Shakespeare (or “The Gem of th
Ocean” as he was ribaldly appelated). 1

Shakespeare’s most important play is, of course, Hamlet (or
Macbeth, as it is sometimes called). This playtells in living
color the story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, who one night
sees a ghost upon the battlements. (Possibly it is 3, goal he
sees.’ I have a first folio edition that is frankly not too legible.)
Anyhow, Hamlet is so upset by seeing the ghost (or goat) that
he stabs Polonius and Bare Bodkin. He is thereupon banished
to a. leather factory by the King, who cries, “Get thee to a
tannery!” Thereupon Ophelia refuses her food until Laertes-A
shouts, “Get thee  a beanery!” Ophelia is so miffed that she
chases her little dog out of the room, crying, “Out: out damned
Spot!” She is lined ﬁfty shillings for swearing, but Portia, in
an eloquent plea, gets the sentence committed to life imprison-
ment. Thereupon King Lear and Queen Mab proclaim 9. festi-
val-complete with amateur theatricals, kissing games, and a.
pie—ea.ting contest. Everyone has a perfectly splendid time till
Banquo’s ghost (or goat) shows up. This so unhinges Richard
III that he drowns. his cousin, Butt Malmsey. This leads to a,
lively discussion. during which everyone is killed. The little dog
Spot returns to utter theimmort.a.l curtain lines:

Alack, the play forsooth. was sad and sobby,
B M be of cheer-the're’s M arlboros in the lobby!
