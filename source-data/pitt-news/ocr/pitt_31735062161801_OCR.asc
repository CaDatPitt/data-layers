MC Rules

On Beanie
Standards

Beanies for all is the new battle-
cry of Men’s Council. Because of
numerous requests for the beanies

by upperclassmen and relatives of»

the students and of the faculty,
Council decided in their meeting
last Tuesday to sell the beanies
to all who request them.

A motion by Don Ewart which
would have held up the open selling
until numerals could be obtained
to distinguish the student’s class
was defeated.

A store in Oakland is already
selling them indiscriminately it
was disclosed at the meeting.

Council also discussed the com-
ing freshman mixer dances. For
this Wednsday’s dance, in 1228 Cl.
from 1:30 to 5, the committee is
planning on Jerry Newberg’s re-
corded music and refreshments.

The third part of Council’s fresh-
man program, the orientation Exam,
was reported on by Dozia Frazier.
He announced that this year's exam
will be prepared by graduate stud-
ents and will be machine scored.

Dario Icardi moved that Council
buy ribbons with Men’s Council
printed on them to designate the
members at the freshmen affairs.
Council okayed the move in a unan-
imous vote.

The Council members who worked
during the summer planning the
freshman program were thanked by
by Howard Greenberger, president
of Men’s Council. "The results of
their work are apparent in the suc-
cess of the program, ” Greenberger
declared.

Musical

Planned

The first coed musical to be pre-
sented at the University will go
into production in the spring. It
will come as the finale of the Pitt
Players’ season. 7

Harvey Pope, the director,
expects the musical to revive the
the interest formerly accorded to
the Cap and Gown’s all-male re-
vues. He asks that students submit
to him at his office, 1309 Cl., the
name of any Broadway musical
that they would like to see done.

The Players will be going all out
to duplicate their success of the
past season. Since Pope assumed
thedirectorship of the group three
years ago, the group has been mak-
ing a reputation in Pittsburgh
drama circles.

The Players have four produc-
tions on their schedule. The first
play, “Arsenic and Old Lace” by
Joseph Kesserling, will run from
Nov. 3 through 5. “Caste” by T.W.
Robertson will
Dec. 15, 16, and‘ 17. On March 16,
17, and 18 the Players will do
Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar.”
The musical will be presented May
18, 19, 20, 2'5, 26, and 2}.

Season tickets are available at
the student desk for $3.

Students who wish to work with
the Players have been urged by the
organ zation to attend a meeting in
1217 Cl. from 3:30 to 7:30 p.m. on
October 3 and 4. At that time pre-
liminary acting tryouts will be held
for the first production.

Positions are available on the
sta e, make—up, and costume crews,

The tickets will go on sale Mon-
day for a reduced rate of $10.35
for the round trip to Philadelphia.
This is about 32 less than the reg-
ular fare for a one-wayriciket.

There's a catch, however. If
there are not at least 300 tickets
sold to Pitt students, the deal is
off as far as the Sun-Telegraph and
the Pennsylvania Railroad are
concerned.

Pennsy Offers Extras

Don Ewart, Congress member
arranged the Pitt end of the event,
says that the Pennsy is willing to
throw in a lot of extras including a
rally at Union Station, a student-
selected name for the train, private
cars for groups who wish them, and
an assurance of plenty of room.

There was even some talk of fit-
ting a boxcar as a traveling dance
hall. An invitation extended to the
band was declined by Director
Robert L. Arthur on the grounds
that there would be “too much
trouble involved” in moving the
instruments from train to buses.

The tour train will leave the sta-
tion shortly after midnight Friday
and‘ arrive in Philadelphia 7:30
Saturday morning. The return trip
will leave Philadelphia a little
before midnight Saturday, reaching

« Pittsburgh at 7:30 a.m. Sunday.

A caravan of buses was also
suggested but was "nayed" by
Congress. The buses would have
been slightly cheaper, but offered
less advantages in the way of com-
fort and capacity.

Secretary Dissents

The motion to support the tour
met with only one dissenting vote,
that of Secretary Cora Pancereve.
Discussion on the motion centered
ﬁround whether Congress should
lend its official support, since
there are to be club cars on the
train. 1

Neighbors Charge

Phi Kaps

  Rowdy

By BOB THOMAS
Apparently Pitt fraternities must not come equipped with park-
ing lots, coeds, or noise of any sort. ‘A suit has been filed
against Phi Kappa fraternity to enjoin the group from "permitting
petting, using offensive language, holding initiations, and playing

loud radios. ‘y’

The suit was filed by W. Hayden Wilson and Henry K. _Kirk-
two ofthe Phi Kaps’ im\-"’ ' “ ’ “-

Patrick,
mediate neighbors in the Hampton
Hall Apartments at 166 North
Dithridge St. Kirk-Patrick is a
member of the English department
at Carnegie Tech.

Not First Complaint
According to the Dean of Men’s
office this is not the first complaint
that has been directed against Phi
Kappa. It is the continuance of a
disturbance that occurred last

\

spring when neighbors complained . 1

to the school authorities about the
noise connected with living beside
a fraternity house. This trouble
as well as the parking lot contro-

versy was smoothed over at
the time.

Named as defendants in the
present action are the Mu Chapter
of Phi Kappa fraternity and the
house mother, Mrs. Camille
MacF.lwee.

Regarding the charges, fraternity
president James Lauble issued a
vigorous denial of all counts. He
called the accusations a “below
the belt attack.” “

He said, “It's a campus rule that
no liquor be allowed on any frater-
nitypremises, and our house mother

has never permittedany of us to,

bring beer into the house.” He
branded the charges “just plain
rabble rousing.”

Neighbors Claim Nuisance

The Phi Kap parking lot was in-
stalled last fall because parking
facilities were sometimes unavail-
able. The neighbors claim that it is
a “nuisance.” ,

The lot is exclusively for frater-
nity members although Hampton
Hall residents have occasionally
asked for and received permission
to park their automoniles there.

This parking lot is allegedly the
scene of late evening petting part-
ies, loud shouting, blasting auto
horns, and boisterous conduct in
general.

According to Attorney Ella
Graubart, who represents the neigh-
bors, the main object of the suit is
to remove the parking lot from the
rear of the Phi Kap house and

‘CHARLES ‘ARNOLD
t 0 o

Professor

Quits Post 

After an unbroken 35 years of
service, Professor Charles Arnold
has retired from the English de-
partment faculty.

Professor Arnold came to Pitt
in 1914 and remained here, except
for a brief interlude for graduate
work at the University of Chicago,
until his retirement. His original
position was that of publicity
worker and instructor in journalism.

He had the unique and rather
lonely experience of being the
first graduate of the world's first
school of journalism and of grad-
uating from a high school whose
senior class was composed of two,
himself and one girl.

Professor Arnold gained his prac-
tical newspaper experience on var-J ’

ious Missouri newspapers, and fin-
ally settled in St. Louis where he
worked on the old St. Louis Star.
He came to Pitt directly from the
Star.

Drill Coach Transferred

To Pentagon Assignment

Next week, Captain James D.
Hunter starts for Washington, leav-
ing’ the Military Science Depart-
ment minus an instructor and the
Pitt Band without its drill coach.

Captain Hunter, familiar to most
students at the University as the
marching band’s drill coach, has
been ordered by the Army to the
Pentagon Building in Washington,
D. C., where he will work for the
Directorate of Program Standards
and Cost Control, USAF Head-
quarters. -'

As band drill coach since 1945,
Captain Hunter, along with Band
Cirector Robert L. Arthur has been
responsible for the precision march-
ing of the fast-stepping football
band.

A veteran of 18 months over-
seas with the Air Corps through
Africa, Sicily, and Italy, Captain
Hunter started his Army career with
a commission from the Pitt ROTC.

He received his B.S. degree here
at the University in 1942. During

Hunter ’s Loss Hurts

The army showed this week that officers, no more than en-
listed men_, are immune from transfer.,The latest illustration,

. though, was hardly appreciated around Pitt. ,

Captain James D. Hunter, the popular ROTC officer and band
marching director, has been ordered from Pitt to the Pentagon
building in Washington October 12 after spending his undergrad-
uate days and four years in the military science department.

Two men in particular and a large segment of the student
population in general regretithe Army’s directive. To Col. John
I. Hincke, head of the military science department, and to Robert
L. _Arthur, director of the University band, Capt. Hunter’s depar-
ture means the loss of a valuable adjutant. ,

Capt. ,Hunter’s work with the band, more so than his regular
duties in the ROTC department, have displayed his abilities. _It
was his job to put the exacting motion into the marching band.

Since 1945, when the organization was revived on campus, he has
joined with Arthur, regarded as one of the top collegiate band
directors, to hoist the Pitt band among the top collegiate outfits
in the country. 4
V Pitt students and Pittsburgh football fans have applauded the
Blue and Gold music makers as they've whipped snappily through
pre-game and half-time performances at Pitt Stadium. Capt. Hunter
and Arthur have been largely responsible for that. '

The band members know it and are sending the departing
officer off with agift worthy ‘of his contribution to them. Doubt-
less, many other students, ROTC recruits who found him the
exception to the usual pattern of the hard-hearted, aloof officer,
feel the same way. i

The Captain has been in the rare position, for a faculty mem-
ber, of having a rather close contact with many students. He
didn’t waste the opportunity.

One-Paragraph Wisdom

The worry over the re-appearance of school spirit at Pitt has
taken on the appearance of the pessimistic yo-yoer who’s afraid
the cylinder he has flipped down won’t come back ‘up. ‘Allow a
few more years for a complete return to normalcy and the spirit
will snap back to the sought-after level of the pre-war years.

By DONALD ‘GIFFIN
Pitt News Editor

 

 

iPublication’s” Row (all of four

offices on the Cathedral’s eighth
floor) was beseiged last week by‘a
present-day Carrie Nation.

A woman graduate of Pitt who
has, for the past few years, been
warring on "the cigarette,” unload-
ed another barrage.

The 1949 Carrie has modified her

predecessor's violent tactics. Ra-

ther than sinking an axe into the-

swinging doors ofa saloon or wrap-
ping an umbrella around the noggin
of a tottering elbow-bender, she re-
sorts to a more peaceful medium-
the mails.

.Prolific essays, accompanied by
reams of qualifying articles, pam-
and magazines, are the
tools of our puff-abatement crusad-
ers.

She aims her broadsides, not at
the pall of smoke that gushes con-
stantly from the open doors of the
820s, Cathedral, but at the Stan

Musials, Paulette Goddards, and
Arthur Godfreys Wl'D dangle cigar-
ettes from lips and fingers in the
ads in the News and Panther.

"What you sell them (tobacco
companies)...will not be merely
space in the paper, but the internal
and external cleanliness of all the
students in the school..~.3’

The smoker is as thoroughly cor-
rupted, in our most regular corres-
pondent’s mind, as is the ‘.‘Los_t
Weeken ” binge artist.

No matter where she went, she
couldn’t have tackled a tougher
spot to work on. College students
burn moretobacco than they do mid-

night oil. Who knows a college man

who climbs in'bed before the wee

_ hours?

Even Pitt, like all but the most
austere schools,- has conceded
somewhat to the smokers. The col-
leges have just had to give. The

smoking areas set up here are grad-
ually eating away the places where
the smoking lamp is out.

After witnessing the latest pos-
tal broadside on the publications,
we of the News decided an explan-
ation of the necessity and desira-
bility of Pitt publications carrying
cigarette advertising might soothe
her.

We also had an ulterior motive.

lWe felt for the mailman’s aching

back.

Nevertheless, we explained that,
without national advertising, of
which cigarette advertising predo-
minates, the publications wouldn't
last long.

Cigarette smoking, too, we sus-
pect, is here to stay. Our vigorous
writer’s mail barrage is just so
much waste of postage stamps.

IF Prexy
Resigns J oh

On Council

   

Ray Maher tendered his resigna-
tion as a member of Men’s Council
in a letter to Howard Greenberger,
president of Men’s Council.

"Due to pressing activities as a
member of Student Congress and
as president of the Inter-Fraternity
Council,” said Maher, ‘'1 find that
I do not have the time to devote to
Men’s Council which my member-
ship obligates
ship obligates me to.”

Greenberger read and accepted
Maher’s resignation at last Tues-
day's meeting. "We are indeed
sorry to lose such an industrious
and sincere worker,” he declared.

A replacement for Maher will be

elected at a special meeting of
Council next Tuesday. It will be
an internal election as prescribed
by Council's newly revised Con-
stitution. The electee must be a
junior in the College.

Maher was elected to Council in
the~spring of 1947 and has served
uninterruptedly since then.

His campus offices and honors

include membership in Druids, hon-'

orary activities fraternity; John
Marshall, honorary pre-law frater-
nity. He is an upperclass councelor
and ran Council's book store last
year.’

Pitt panthers and pantherettes
can prowl at West View Park Dance-
land during the sophomore class’
informal Panther Prowl, Oct. 14.

Lee Kelton and his WJAS radio
orchestra will be stationed in the
West View stockade to supply the

Jack Shano has been elected
chairman of the dance while John
Hogan will serve as business man-
_ager.

Publicity Director Don Herowitz

for summer study, graduate work,
or the spending of the junior year
abroad.

To investigate the opportunities
for American students to get part
‘of their education overseas, Mrs.
Mitchell visited the summer schools
of Southampton, Bristol, London,
Birmingham, Nottingham, Leeds
and Edinburgh in England.

A similar tour through France
took her to Paris, Dijon, Poitiers,
Rennes, and Grenoble.

Visits Switzerland

On a side trip, she stopped at
University of Neuchatel in
Switzerland, which has an Ameri-
can section headed by Dr. Elisa-
beth Waelti of the Pitt faculty and
was recently attended by Vernie
Stanislaw, winner of the Tap Day
award for Nationality Rooms host-
esses.

Mrs. Mitchell feels that it is
essential for future leaders on the
American scene to have some study
abroad, and especially urges Pitt
students to take advantage of the
growing chances for such study.

Plans Travel Aid

To encourage more students to
go overseas, Mrs. Mitchell plans
to have regular consulting hours’
for anyone interested in foreign‘
study. A tea will honor faculty
members and students who have
been abroad during 1948-1949.

Pitt students who have spent
time studying in overseas schools
bring back enthusiastic reports,
according to Mrs. Mitchell.

Among those who have left to go
abroad in recent months are Peggy
Antoon at the American University
in Beirut, and Marcus Allen who is
in France on ascholarship from the
French government.

C  Art Exhibit 

Unveiled in

F A Gallery

Helen West Heller's exhibition of _

woodcuts in the Fine Arts gallery
demonstrates the fine work which
can be done through this medium.

The 35 woodcuts represent many
themes and styles. Miss Heller's
realistic prints such as “Alabama
Biochemist" are in sharp contrast
no: the geometric design of "Penta-
gon.’,’ Her skillful handling of
religious subjects is demonstrated
by ‘.'Saint Francis Singing” and
"Creation. ’ ’

Miss Heller has exhibited her
work in many of the outstanding
museums of the country. The Lib-
rary of Congress, Brooklyn Museum,
Metropolitan Museum of New York,
and others have acquired her work
for their permanent collections.

She has also won numerous
prizes. "Nocturne,” included in
the Pitt exhibit, won the Library of
Congress’ 1949 Pennel Competition.
‘ Woodcutting is not Miss Heller’s
only talent. She has done easal
painting, murals‘, and mosaic work.

The exhibition will continue
through Oct. 12. The gallery, on
the 7th floor Cl, is open to the
p\~i__l_s’lic Monday through Saturday.

Chemist’s Cutter
Cancels Coed’s
Cuticle Cristiésv

Pitt’s Dr. Alexander Silverman
has come a-cutting to the rescue
‘of the cuticle-conscious coed.

No longer will she have to saw
furiously with an outmoded ‘faulty
steel file that just doesn't do the
job at that tender spot where the
nail joins the finger. For Doctor
Silverman has patented a triangular
nail file.

With this new file, our coed can
work in one of the small edges and
with a few quick passes went away
the ugly nail edge. without damag-
ing the nail itself or hacking up
herfinger.

The new file is long, light, and
triangular, tapering from a small
point to a smooth handle which is
suitable for the inter-locking, over-
lapping, or choke grip, as milady
desires.

For those females who are
sticklers for technicalities, the.

Debaters
Set Plans

The Men's Debating Association,
undefeated state champion last
year, has started planning for the
coming campaign.

As in the past the planners must
keep a careful eye on the railroad
schedules, Last season the Assoc-
iation debated 254 times, involving
5500 miles of travel.

Debates have already been arran-
ged in Boston, Massachusetts and
at the_ University of Virginia. The
Association's first encounter is
tentatively set before a gathering
of state high school debate coaches.

Debate mentor Fred Robie has
announced that opportunities are
plentiful for new members this
year. The debators will meet from
2:30 p.rn. to 4:30 p.m. on Tuesdays
and Thursdays.

The first meeting will be held
Tuesday Oct. 4 in 132 C1. Women
interested in debating will meet at
the same time in 1217 C1.

To spectators at the William
and Mary—Pitt game Saturday,
the Varsity Marching Band ap-
peared _as_pr.Vecision-drillged and
hqigh-spirited as thoroughbred show-
hiorses.

Roll the calendar back to Mon-
day, September 19 and the band
plresents a strongly contrasting
sycene.

Shake ‘llangovers’

The first day at Camp Kon-O-
Kwee, band director Robert L..Ar-
thur and Captain James Hunter, drill
coach, saw a rough job ahead of
them. Suffering lethargic summer
hangovers, divorced from their ins-
truments for three months, made up
of about half new members, this
group would take some doing.

Mr. Arthir tackled his project
with characteristic good humor.

At music rehearsal, Mr. Arthur
took pains to instruct the new mem-
bers in methods of stopping a band.
"The three techniques,” he said,
"are to stand there and hope that
all the players will run out of wind,
to give the halt signal to the half
of the band that sometimes
watches the director and wait for
the rest of them to follow suit, or
to have everyone stop on signal.."

‘Heavy Reading’

In spite of the cold nights spent
in unheated tents and the inky
darkness in what was lovingly
termed "Pneumonia Gulch,” some
bandsmen remained in good spirits.
One wit was heard to remark while
groping through the forest, "Why
doesn't the sun shine at night
when you need it?”

And a certain musician, trying
his hand for the first time at read-
the small music notes while boun-
cing along at that 180 pace ex-
claimed, "This is like reading the
Pitt News on the Toonerville
Trolley.” , .

Band camp gave Ben Benack,
new assistant director of Univer-
sity bands and orchestras, a
chance to make his debut.

Signs Hint

Decline Of
IM Kin g s

B.V ANDY SCIIURMAN

It is likely that a new IM foot-
ball champ may be crowned this
fall, as the Locals, independent
titlists, and the Phi Gams, frater-
nity winners, are both faced with
a rebuilding program.

According to Bob Wicks, last
year's Local captain who is now
in Dent School, his ex-teammates
will be doubtful contenders.

Locals Lose Three

Three members of the Local sex-
tet have either graduated or have
gone fraternity, leaving Dynamite
Tank Valacenti and Bob Badke to
reorganize the loose ends. Another
star, Gene Gaugler, is trying for a
berth on the Panther Jayvee squad
in spite of a serious head injury
received as a varsity fullback in
1944.

The Locals lost but one game
last year, that being a disputed
contest with the Carnegie Tech IM
champs for the Oakland title.

Fijis Pessimistic

Phi Gam sources,meanwhile, are
a bit pessimistic as graduation and
transfers caused a terrific shakeup
in personnel. Bob Hornet along
with Tuffy Thompson and Rex
McLain will carry the brunt of the
Gam attack on their shoulders.

Delta Tau Delta charges, who
have been strengthened by the
Local’s losses, look like the team
to beat in the frat race.

°PP°Slte‘ Gate 14 of the Stadium
on Monday at 4:30, it has been
announced by Coach Ben Grady.

Those who cannot report at the
requested time should make an ap-
pearance any day after 4:30 at
Trees Pool.

The opening of practice will
mark the beginning of a new ef-
fort on Grady s part to build up an-
other long winning streak. At the
close of last season, Penn State
snapped the Panthers’ I3-meet
skein by a 38-37 score.

Pitt mermen hollered foul after
the meet.» They scorned the offici-
ating.

Now, however, the loss is so
much water under the diving board,
for Grady and his pupils have a
fresh season before them.

Four truck loads of top soil were
put on the Ellsworth practice field,
smoothing out treacherous ruts and
ditches.

Northwestern

With Proven

Club Loaded

Veterans

N DAVE POLLOCK

It took Pitt a long time to say hello to Northwestern in a foot-
ball way, and before Saturday’s struggle is over the Panthers may
wish the Wildcats had turned their backs.

In history's first clash between the two schools, the Iungle

Cats travel to Evanston to run
headlong into last year's Rose
Bowl champs.

To make matters even worse,
only three regulars, Frank Aschen-
brenner, halfback, Alex Sarkisian,
center’, and George Maddock,tackle,
were lost to the Wildcats by grad-
uation.

Veteran Team

Coach Bob Voigts has 34 letter-
men returning and he has built his
offense around a strong running
game headed by Art Murakowski.-

The hard running fullback has
led Northwestern in scoring and
ground gaining for the past three
seasons. Twice he has been
elected the team’s most valuable
player.

Running with Murakowski in the
backfield are Ed Tunnicliff and
John Miller at the halfbacks, and
Don Burson at quarterback.

Linemen Tough

Captain Steve Sawle at tackle
heads a line that averages over
200 pounds per man.

In the Purdue game last week
which Northwestern won, 20-6, the
Boilermakers were able to gain
only 46 yards from rushing through
the Big Purple line.

Surprisingly, Purdue gained 191
yards by passing. In 1948, North-
western led the nation in pass
defense and ‘was expected to throw
up a strong aerial defense again
this year.

Punting a Problem

Kicking and passing are con-
sidered the Wildcats most vulner-
able spots.

Ashenbrenner did a superb job of
punting last fall and a capable re-
placement hasn’t been found as yet.

Burson will do most of the pass-
ing again this year from the T
quarterback slot. Though consid-
ered above the average as aPaSS€f»
he has been hampered by an arm
injury since late last fall.

John Chickerneo, assistant Pitt
backfield coach, and former Pitts-
burgh Steeler Johnny Clement,
were teammates in the service.

Griclders Adopt
Air Policy For
Dual Purpose

Mike Milligan’s Panthers flew to
Evanston, Illinois this morning for
their game with Northwestern tomor-
row.

The traveling squad of 36 play-
ers will arrive in the Midwest city
in the early afternoon. Light drills
are scheduled soon after arrival.

Traveling, however, will not be
the only aerial aspect of the game,
if Pitt’s past week of scrimmage is
any hint of things to come. The
Panthers spent the week sharpen-
ing their passing attack. In all pro-
bability Bimbo Cecconi will throw
quite a few passes before the final
whistle blows.

Cecconi, as well as receivers
Nick DeRosa, Ted Geremsky, John
Masarik, and Carl DePasqua, show-
ed in drills the form that enabled
the Panthers to score against Wil-
liam and Mary.

By MYRON KOPELMAN
Sports Editor

  

011 This Line  

Bobby Boucher, the former Boston University halfback whiz who
became indifferent to more than just the baked beans in Boston, has
beenturned down by Pitt in his attempt to switch to another ball club.

Although the grounds for rejection are kept confidential by the

Registrar, it is known that Boucher’
of Phi Beta Kappa quality. The
speedy back, who by the way
comes from Dormont, denies that
this was the reason.

He claims that the Registrar’s
office wrote him that he had simply
applied too late for entrance--this,
despite the common knowledge that
he was interviewed in the Dean of
Men’s office two weeks before the
start of the fall semester.

And the Registrar accepts appli-

*cations right up to the close of
registration week. _ «
‘lnot-her Angle ‘

At any rate the New England
hotfooter is not with us. Yet it
was not so much the roles played
‘by the Registrar or Boucher’s
‘grades that made the case so inter-
esting, but rather the actions of
"the athletic department.

Now offhand you might suppose
that any coaching staff would re-
joice at the news that a player of
Boucher’s proven talents was in-
tending to enter its school. Much
to the contrary, however, Mike
Milligan and his aides hardly threw
a lavish reception for Boucher
when they heard’ of his intentions.

In fact, they threw no reception
whatsoever. No coaches went forth
with nice things to say. No alumni
met him with handsome promises.
Diplomacy Employed

Certainly they wanted a man like
Boucher. But they were in the posi-

enter school in the regular “manner
and then try out for the team, OK.
If he cannot getjinto the school via
this procedure, OK, too.

The fact was that Pitt was hav-
ing small truck with transfer stu-
dents, especially ‘the kind that
part on bad terms from their first
alma mater. The Panthers make no
practice of stealing players from
foreign campuses, and were
anxious to make it clear that they
had in no way done any wooing in

the Boucher case.

Pitt Stand Understandable

Pitt’s caution toward such play.-
ers as Boucher is both creditable
and understandable. The school is
merely disdaining the tactics which
North Carolina employed in swip-«
ing the promising Fred Sherman
from the Panther squad only three
years back.

What ever happened to Sherman,
you ask?

Why, he was injured in his first
year and thereafter reportedly re-
ceived little of what the fine
southern gentlemen had promised
him.

Cathedral Gets Face Lifting

During Summer Session

By BOB THOMAS

The summer treated the Cathed-
ral well. At least the men who work-
ed inside and out over the past
three months makeit look that way.

The lawn is once more the re-
splendent green spread that it was
before the Spring Festival stakes
started goring in. Not even the com-
mencement or the intermittent drill-
ings that are going on at present
have dulled the new luster that the
gardners applied.

The thirsty Pittite who leans far
down into the depths of the water
fountain there and jams on the
handle to coax out a drop or two
is greeted with an eye-splattering
deluge.
