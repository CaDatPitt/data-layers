Pitt has the third highest resident tuition ($1 ,'366
annually)of all Government-supported umv€rSlI1€S
in the United States , according to a recent study
released by the National Association or State
Universities and Land Grant Colleges.

The yearly study, sent from Washington D.C.
in the last week of October, showed Pitt, Temple

‘ and Penn State, Pennsylvania’s three major state-

related schools, have three of the top five resident

Cornell University has the highest ($1,950) and
Vermont is fourth ($1,366), Completing the top
five.

The study indicated a median student bill, for a
year’s attendance at one of the major public
universities will increase 6.7 percent this year,
barely exceeding the 6.6 percent rise in the Con-
sumer Price Index for 1976-77.

While the median total charges (tuition, fees,
room and board) for undergraduates will be
$2,108, Pitt’s.is $3,016, ranking it third highest in
total resident charges. Pitt’s non—resident tuition
and total charges figures are $2,676 and $4,326,

lone Phillips, contact for the study, said, “We
have done the study for 15 years. The main reason
(for doing it) is the enormous interest and to
highlight the fact that student charges, which have
traditionally been low, have been relentlessly in-
creasing in recent years.”

“We have no further use for it (the study), but
many universities use it as an analysis on how their
university compares with a cross section across the
nation,” she added. Phillips said approximately
10 copies were mailed to Pitt.

CAS Council Vetoes
Distribution Proposal

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Slztft Writer

The College of Arts and Sciences
Council yesterday voted down a
proposal to require students to take
itional courses in a division

 / outside their major fields of study.

The proposal would have re-
quired students entering Pitt as
freshmen in fall 1978 to take ﬁve
courses in one of the three CAS
divisions, humanities, social
sciences and natural sciences, in
order to fulfill the distribution of
studies requirements. Current dis-
tribution of studies standards
require only that students accumu-
late a total of three courses in each
division. Two new courses," speci-

would have been arranged in a
cluster determined by individual
departments.

The proposal, according to CAS
Associate Dean Jack Daniels, was
intended to increase the depth and
breadth of the student’s know-
ledge.

According to CAS Dean Robert
Marshall, passage of the proposal
might have triggered a reevalua-
tion of courses offered by each
department.

“It is possible you might cause
changes that could create a dynamo
that could eventually cause someof
the courses to improve,” Marshal
said. “For example, if a depart-
ment had to ask themselves what

Students at Capitol
Vocal but Orderly

By RICH HARRY

Pit! News Staffwriter

HARRISBURG--Students from
Pennsylvania’s four state-related
universities, including Pitt,
converged on the Capitol steps
yesterday to call for the release of
approved appropriations to their
universities.

Some 3,000 students from Pitt,
Penn State, Temple and Lincoln
Universities listened to a parade of
speakers that included. Governor
Shapp, party leaders, Pitt Student
Government Board president
Bernie’ Payne and, after much of the
crowd had dispersed, Pitt
Chancellor Wesley Posvar.

The character of the rally was as

mild as the weather, but the
students were vocal and frequently
interrupted speakers, especially the
legislators.

They listened to Democrat James
Manderino and Republican Robert
Butera, House majority «and
minority leaders, place the blame
on each other’s party for the
impasse that has delayed $300
million in funds to the state-related
universities, including $61.7 million
to Pitt.

Manderino pledged continued
Democratic support for funding of
higher education, adding that the
Republicans did not vote for full

The Rally: A Different View

By RICH HARRY
Pitt News St;tl'l’\\‘mcr

HARRISBURG—Dave Hesi-
dence stood on the Capitol steps at
yesterday’s rally for prompt deliv-
ery of funds for the state-related
‘universities, and is still convinced
mass lobbying isn't the most effec-
tive measure for students to use in
dealing with the current legislative
impasse. ' ~
Hesidence, one of two Student
Government Board members to
vote against funding Pitt transpor-
tation to Harrisburg, sees little
chance the lobby will inﬂuence
legislation to finance
Pennsylvania’s four financially

crippled universities.

The root of the problem in mass
student lobbying, Hesidence said,
is numbers. Students at Pitt,
Temple, Lincoln and Penn State
compose an exceedingly small
number of the state’s total voting
population; perhaps as little as one
percent, ‘a number that can’t
effectively pressure state ofﬁcials to"
vote favorably for higher education.

“We can’t have much input in_

Harrisburg,” Hesidence said
Friday of ‘the some 3,000 students
who lined the Capitol steps. “What
will happen in the Legislature will
happen, no matter what we say.”
He said legislative action is
dictated primarily by the ofﬁcials’
desire for re-election, an ambition

1

that is mot efficiently dealt with in
student lobbying.

“We’re dealing with political
ambition in a lot of ways,”
Hesidence said. “The Legislature
knows constituents don’t want them
to raise taxes, so they're not going
out on a limb to vote for a tax hike. ”

And students just don’t have the
political clout, he said, to move the
Legislature to vote for more taxes

and to pave the way for Pitt’s
appropriation.

“This is a pessimistic, but
realistic outlook,” he said. ‘

Hesidence’s strategy would
emphasise face-to-face contact with

/ legislators, in an effort to build what

he sees as a more effective working
relationship for the future.

“We're not ready for lobbying.
We must make appointments and
see the Legislature face to face. It
won’t change votes this year, but it
will build a foundation for the
future, so legislators know us and
are. more sensitive to what the
University of Pittsburgh is all
about.”

Even this is a problem,
Hesidence said, in light of the few
personal contacts made this year by

2). students. “We must raise the

consciousness of the students
here...the rally should be on the
campus instead of the steps in
Harrisburg.

“And the media is not the contact
students need. Two minutes on the
six o’clock news report is not
enough...they must go to the
legislators and explain the problem
and explain how it can be
resolved.”

Nor can the media, he added,

show the public that funding higher
education is in its best interest. “No
matter how the rally comes off, I
can't see how it will affect the
public. They’ll say they’ll have to
pay taxes to support the extra
funds.”

HARRISBURG (AP)—Senate
Democratic leaders offered another
new tax plan yesterday to fund the
state-related universities and insti-
tutions.

The proposal would increase the
personal income tax from 2 percent
to 2.2 percent and push the
corporate net income tax to
10.75 percent.

The ﬁgures are slightly lower
than contained in the tax proposal
that was defeated Monday night.

The plan, offered by Sen. Joseph
Smith, D-Philadelphia, also calls
for levying a 4.5 percent tax on
out-of-state utilities.

The Senate delayed ﬁnal action
on the proposal after adding it to a
pending tax bill.

three courses should be in the
sequence, itlmight cause a fresh
look at the curriculum.”
Opponents of the proposal
argued it limited a student's
choices, and that the courses would
be taken by students “just to get
them out of the way.” Council
members also voiced fears the new
course requirements would cause a
surplus of 80’s courses.
“I could see using it to have the
students learn skills,” Said CAS

Qgouncil member Herbert Chesler.

“My concern is in providing more
obligations for the student to fill. If
all the major courses are taken
during the freshman and sopho-
more years, I don’t think the
student is learning, and that’s why
I'm uncomfortable legislating more
requirements.”

students in the past have fulﬁlled

Marshall, the 974 CAS students

funding of the state-related univer-
sities.

Butera spoke to students and
reporters after his speech, and
criticized the Democrats for exclud-
ing the GOP from budget deliber-
ations over the summer.

Students avoided pinning blame
on either party, agreeing a
compromise between the two is
essential to break the funding
deadlock. They praised the lobby
for seeking a resolution of the crisis.

“I think the students now will
monitor the Legislature more
closely,” said John Manuel,
president of the undergraduate
student body at Lincoln University.
“They’ve suffered curtailments in
programs, and now they know the
culprits are the legislators.”

Other student leaders spoke in a
similar vein. Grant Ackerman, Penn
State’s undergraduate student
president, claimed mass student
mobilization for next year’s
elections could change the makeup
of the Legislature, by electing
ofﬁcials sympathetic to the state-
related universities.

“Students can be motivated to
participate in the state elections,”
Ackerman said, “and they can be a
party swing vote.”

Speaking to a reporter on the way
back to Pitt, SGB President Bernie
Payne said the rally “served its
purpose” in mobilizing students.

“People now can’t say we have an
empty voice,” Payne said.

He indicated efforts will be made
to persuade citizens that funding
higher education is in their best
interest, noting several
services the University provides.

“lt’s up to us to show the beneﬁts

“I don’t think citizens mind paying
for something when they get
something in return.”

Payne said lobbying strategy now
will shift to personal contacts with
the Legislature, adding that student
leaders from the other state-
related universities are slated to
meet with the board Sunday.

the funding deadlock was a
“political problem.”

“We (state-related universities)

part of the budget not to be
funded,” he said.

A Wise Choice

Yesterday's CAS Council decision to reject the recommendations
of the ad hoc Committee on the Distribution of Studies was a

good one.

Had the recommendations been adopted, six credits in a non-
major division would have been added to the present distribution
requirement-for next year’s freshmen. Students now are required
simply to accumulate at least nine credits in each of the three
divisions, humanities, social science and natural science.

While the interest shown by the ad hoc committee in a well-
rounded, coherently directed liberal arts education is commen-
dable, we feel additional course requirements areiunnecessary.
Most students who desire that _well-rounded education already have
fulfilled the recommended additional requirements. For those
students who wish to concentrate heavily in their major area of
study, the new requirements only would impose an unneeded ad-

ditional burden.

On the other hand, some of the committee’s recommendations
deserve further consideration. The charge that there are too many
graduate teaching assistants instructing introductory courses is a
valid one, and the situation should be rectified. Students’ first im-
pressions of the different disciplines are important, especially for
those who have yet to choose a major. The best qualified teachers
available should handle lower level courses.

As noted in the committee’s report, the existing wide range of
courses available to students seeking to fulfill the distribution
requirement allows them to avoid large lecture courses in favor of
smaller classes. This should be continued.

If anything needs to be added to the committee’s recommen-
dations, it is an increased emphasis on basic skill courses.
Although new requirements are not desirable, incoming students
should be encouraged to take courses in areas such as writing and

critical reading.

Caliguiri and the Democratic Party

By R. DAVID TIVE

Eight days is usually enough time
for the backlash of an election to die
down. By the eighth day, the losers
have licked their wounds and
decided what office to run for next.
By the eighth day the winners have
slept off their victory parties and
decided what ofﬁce to runkfor next.
And, by the eighth day, newspaper
columnists have written their
post-mortems and analyses of the
election.

The problem with those post-
mortems and analyses is they deal
primarily with what has passed.

True, they have a certain value in C

any case, but it is equally valuable
to discuss the election in terms of its
implications for the future. The two
most pressing matters upcoming for
Pennsylvania politics are the control
of the Democratic Party here in
Pittsburgh, and next year’s race for
Governor of Pennsylvania.
Dick Caliguiri is now in the same

position Pete Flaherty was eight
years ago in terms of his
relationship with the Democratic
Party. He is a Democrat, but was
elected by running against the
endorsed candidate, and over the
efforts of the so-called machine.
What remains to be seen is if he
handles that relationship in the
same way Flaherty did.

Throughout his eight years,
Flaherty never challenged the basic
structure and organization of the
party. All he ever did was attack the
top. He ran candidates for high
elected positions such as district
attorney and county commissioner.
A number of times he won;
sometimes he lost. But what "he
never did was attack the Democratic
Party where it lives, in the wards
and voting districts. He never
challenged the ward chairmen. He
never challenged the committee-
men, of which there are one man
and one woman in each voting

Letters To The Editor

    
 

Abortion Article Clariﬁed

Congratulations to Dan McKay
for being brave enough to tackle
the subject of abortion in his recent
three article series. Although it is
impossible to deal adequately with

this crucial and controversial

subject in three articles, he is, I
hope, provoking some serious
thinking on this topic.

lbelieve, however, he misunder-
stood a statement I made concern-
ing the role of People Concerned
for the Unborn Child (PCUC) in the
establishment of the local chapter

of Birthright. He stated the

founders of PCUC started Birth-

district. As a result, when he left,
there was no Flaherty organization
to fill in for his absence. Had he
tried to run a hand-picked heir as
mayor, he would have had a difficult
time since his popularity was based
on personal loyalty and not on
political power.

Caliguiri is now faced with the
same type of situation. Every
committeeman, committeewoman
and ward chairman in the city is up
for re-election next year. By
running people for those positions
in wards where he did well last
week, Caliguiri could take personal
control of much of the Democratic
Party. He could certainly weaken
the party to the point where it would
not pose much of a threat to him in
the future.

Will the new mayor choose to take
on the party, or will he decide to
ignore it for a while like his
predecessor? No one knows for
sure, but I would venture a guess
that his decision will depend greatly
on his perceptions of the likely
outcome of another election next
year, that of the Govemor’s race.

Conventional wisdom has declar-
ed 1978 to be a Republican year in
Pennsylvania, and it may well be
correct. In fact, the Republican’s
main problem may not be electing a
governor, but deciding exactly
which Republican to elect. There‘
are ﬁve people who seem to want
the job, including Robert Butera,
minority leader of the State House;
Henry Hager, minority leader of the
State Senate; Richard Schweiker,
U.S. Senator; Arlen Spector,
former Philadelphia district attor-
ney, and Richard Thornburgh,
former U.S. attorney for Southwest
Pennsylvania. If they can avoid a

 

 

right “really for tax reasons.”
What I stated in the interview is
that the founders of PCUC realized
from the very beginning, in 1969, a
pro-life group had to be more than
anti-abortion. We realized troubled
pregnant women, a most exploited
group, had to have positive help
and alternatives to abortion avail-
able to them. PCUC is the
education and lobbying agent of
the local pro-life movement, but we
do not directly supply emergency
pregnancy services to women.
Birthright is a service organization
that does not lobby, and therefore

self-destructive primary ﬁght, one
of those men will have a good

chance of beating the Democratic
candidate.

And who will that candidate he?
Prior to last Tuesday there seemed
to be three choices: Al Benedict,
current auditor general; Robert
Casey, former auditor general, and
Ernest Kline, lieutenant governor.
Since last Tuesday, a fourth
contender has arisen. That’s right,
Peter J. Flaherty himself.

Why the resurgence of a Flaherty
candidacy? It’s very simple. With
Caliguiri as mayor, and the odd
couple of Jim Flaherty and Bob
Pierce controlling county govern-
ment, the “Democratic machine”
has no base to use against Pete, and
he therefore runs no chance of
having his solid southwestern
Pennsylvania support reduced.
With that solid support, he can run a
strong statewide campaign.

However, any Democratic can- '

didate will have to run with the
albatross of the “scandal-ridden”
Shapp administration around his
neck. All the contenders, whether
they are friends of Milton Shapp or
not, will be hurt by that image. That
is why most observers are picking
the Republicans in 1978. I don’t
necessarily agree, but then I don’t
have the ear of powerful politicians.

So where does that leave Dick
Caliguiri and his decision on
whether to challenge for control of
the Democratic Party? A
Republican governor . next year
means a Democratic Party in
Pennsylvania with no leader. It will
have no governor; no lieutenant
governor; no senators; no strong

leadership in the State House; no A"

The “right to choose” is, in‘

reality, the right to kill one’s
offspring. Pro-life organizations
defend and speak on behalf of the
youngest members of the human

do our best to provide troubled

necessary to choose life rather than

strong leadership in the State
Senate; a lame-duck, one-more-

and, oh yes, a new, young,
attractive guy, with a clean record,
as mayor of Pittsburgh.

Leadership abhors a vacuum.
President Carter, running for
re-election in 1980 particularly
abhors a vacuum in the leadership
of the Democratic Party in a crucial
state like Pennsylvania. Someone
will have to step in to take charge.

The implication should be c *5
A successful move by Caliguiri in
1978 for local party control is an egg
in the basket for 1980 when
Schweiker’s term is up, or for 1982
when it is gubernatorial time again.
At the very least, it will put Caliguiri
into a position of statewide
leadership where he can have a
major voice in determining who
those people will be.

With that at stake, will Caliguiri
make his move for control ot the

local party apparatus? You bet v '
will. ‘

- Punk Rockers Ramones

By JIM FARERI

“We’re punk rock,” said Johnny
Ramone, guitarist for America’s
premiere and most exposed punk
rock band, The Ramones. “If
anybody is punk rock, we’re punk
rock.”

But Johnny and the other
Ramone “brothers”—Joey,
Tommy and DeeDee—approach
their punk status with tougue-in-

cheek. They’re naturally conscious
of being referred to as punk rockers,
but they demonstrate none of the
attitudes the press has worked so
hard to associate them with.

For instance; a punk rocker
supposedly is against playing in
large concert halls——this is “selling
out,” being “impersonal.” But
when Johnny was asked whether
The Ramones would play in places
that seat several thousand, he had
to hold back a laugh.

“Of course! We have a tour

I coming up next week in which we

play 2,000-to 5,000-seat halls in
Boston, Chicago, St. Louis,” he
said.

Then, Johnny described the true
punk. “A true punk doesn’t care
about fashions or fads. A true punk
isn’t supposed to care about
anything....not even rock ’n’ roll.”

In concert, though, Johnny and
his adopted brothers make good
punks. With their leather jackets,
torn blue jeans and scuffed
sneakers, the band affects an
impeccable NYC street kid image.
They stand close together on stage,
spare the audience interaction, and
deliver non-stop rock ’n’ roll. There
are no breaks between songs: they
charge through their 20-plus
catalogue of two-minute minimal
rockers in the time it takes most
bands just to get warmed up. Their
impatience with themselves and the
unusual distance they keep from
their audience is very punk.

Lead singer Joey Ramone is the
ﬁgurehead of the group. He stands
over six feet, wears tinted
egg-shaped glasses, and never lets
go of the microphone stand when he
sings. His movements are sparse
and inarticulate; his voice is a
half-cocked imitation of a 1960's
British popster.

Backstage, Joey described The
Ramones’ music as “Ah...new and

Olivia’ Newton-Johnllmayilhave a pretty dece

unique...and ah...it’s about...and
it’s. . .how do I describe our music...
ah, how do we describe our music,
Tom?”

With his animated disinterest
and scorn for the serious, Joey is the
biggest punk in the band--and it
comes from just being himself.

Johnny is a lot more straight-
forward and down-to-earth than
Joey.

“When I ﬁrst saw Elvis Presley, I
decided I wanted to become a rock
’n’ roll star,” said the talkative
guitarist. ‘ ‘Then I forgot about it for
awhile until I saw. the Beatles, and
then I again realized I wanted to be a
rock ’n’ roll star.”

Johnny is the kid whose wildest
dream came true, and it’s easy to
see he revels in it.

As one of the ﬁrst new wave
bands, The Ramones are proud of
the distance they’ve come and the
success they’ve achieved.

“We’ve proved ourselves, while
everyone else is just putting out
their ﬁrst album,” said Johnny.
“We’ve put out three albumszeach
one has gotten better and each one
has had 14 good songs on it.

Keeping to the essential essen-
tials, any one of The Ramones’
songs makes as good a single as the
next. The band offers a good
sampling from each of their albums
in its set, which includes an encore
of three songs.

“We’rejust arock ’n’ roll band,”
Johnny said, when asked to plead
his case before a less than
punk-prone university audience.
“Don’t be sucked in by all the bull
you read. They play up violence
when there is no violence. It’s sick.
We’re just .trying to get the
excitement back into rock ’n’ roll
and to entertain people. We just
want everyone to have a good
time.”

And the hundred or so that

gathered at Antonino’s had a good ,

time. Indeed, it was an unlikely
locale and audience for a punk rock
concert: Antonino’s, a dry, under-
21 club, clean and modern, with a
crowd of well-dressed collegiates.
But The Ramones are anxious for a
wider audience.

“There wasn’t much good rock
coming out when we started,” said
Johnny, “now there's a whole new

J"

The Ramones, America’s first and foremost punk rock band don’t quite fit in
the same category as British entries like the Sex Pistols. Even if they don’t
mutilate themselves with safety pins, the Ramones can play some first rate
rock ’n’ roll, as they proved last weekend at Antonino’s in Oakland.

Wonderland’ ’), and a dozen motion
picture screenplays, Ellison also
has toured with the Rolling Stones
and has served as a television critic
to'the-Los Angeles Free Press. Since
he began writing in the late 1950's,
Ellison has won six and a half Hugo
awards for science fiction stories,
two Nebula awards and three best
teleplay of the year awards, as Well
as the Edgar-Allen Poe award for
the best mystery short story in 1974.
Ellison said he feels the sci-ﬁ
label is detrimental‘ to a writer’s

career.

‘ ‘Theodore Sturgeon is one of the
ﬁnest writers today, but he hasﬁ,
never been allowed to rise to .the 4
popular level because he was
labeled ‘science fiction,’ ” Ellison
said.

He said the hard core sci-ti
audience will leech off a writer and,
if the writer changes from the norm,
the audience will destroy him.
Personally, Ellison prefers the term
fantasy to science ﬁction.

superior to “Elton John’s Greatest
Hits Volume I” because there is
more variety in the selections.

This new reLease includes
“Philadelphia Freedom,” “The
Bitch is Back,” “Levon,” “Island
Girl,” “Someone Saved My Life
Tonight” and “Don’t Go Breaking
My Heart.” -

There are also two versions of
other people’s hits—-the Beatles’
“Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds”
and the Who’s “Pinball Wizard.”
Granted, John recorded both, but
they aren’t exactly the songs one
would identify with him. I

There are also some dumb
choices. “Sorry Seems To Be The
Hardest Word” and “Grow Some
Funk Of Your Own" aren’t exactly
John’s high points. Especially
when you consider that neither
greatest hits album included “Tiny
Dancer” or “Mona Lisas and
Madhatters." John probably is
saving them for his third greatest
hits volume.

Overall, if you like Elton John,
you’ll like this album. One gripe,
and it’s a small on_e—-—why can't
these things come out in some sort
of chronological order? It used to
be that greatest hits albums could
be separated into early hits and
more recent ones, not a random

grouping.

An especially annoying thing
about greatest hits albums is when
the star doesn’t have enough hits to
fill both sides of a 45, let alone a
whole album.

This is exactly the case ‘hi,
“Olivia Newton-John’s Grezrgf
Hits.” *

Well, not ex_actly—a single and a
half could do it. Outside of “Have
You Never Been Mellow,” “Let
Me Be There” and “I Honestly
Love You,” there’s really nothing
in this album.

Probably the most redeeming
feature of this album is the
double-jacket photos of “Livvy,"
and then only for lovesick
adolescent boys. Newton-John has
been busy filming the film version
of “Grease” with John Travolta .‘_
and hasn't been recording latelﬂé»

The three main songs on this
album are good, at least. Heaven
help us when Travolta releases his

Ellison said he would like to say
he has been heavily inﬂuenced by
other writers, but that his ideas are
amorphous and come from his head.

.‘ ‘I gave Time a list of authors who
inﬂuenced me,” he said, “but mv
imagination was stirred most by
comic books, old-time radio, pulp
magazines and movies—the kind
they say are bad for children
today.”

Ellison taught himself to read
and, by the time he was in grade
school, had read most of the classics
and turned to the pulp magazines.

“Startling Stories was the ﬁrst
magazine I bought,” he said, “and
that had an amazing effect on me.”

Ellison went to Ohio State, did
time in the Army, and had written
several stories that didn’t really
catch on until Dorothy Parker gave a
favorable review to “Gentleman
Junkie” in Esquire. Regarded as
one of the leaders of the progressive
change in science ﬁction since he
edited the anthology “Dangerous
Visions” in the late 1960's, Ellison
said the newest writers of science
fiction are still predominently white
and male.

“Black people have to deal with
reality too much to become involved
with fantasy,” he said. He added
since science ﬁction is basically
male wish fulﬁllment, women
writers tend to stay away from it. .

Ellison does not see the fall of the
basic sci-ﬁ plot—fair maidens being
rescued from monsters by male
heroes. He said the same stuff is
being published, now about
wizards.

Ellison's new group of storles
includes one on jazz musician
D’jango Reinhart, who went to war
at a late age and lost some of his
ﬁngers, but returned to play his
guitar on stage.

“History also is altered by artists
and poets,” Ellison said of the
story. “Secondly, one must sacri-
ﬁce everything to one’s art.”

As for Ellison’s own sacriﬁces to
his craft, he said he could consider
his four marriages and four divorces
casualties, “but maybe it’s my
fault, maybe I’m messed up
anyway.” 1

Ellison’s descriptive personal
style of writing often depicts the
grotesque in life. He dislikes the

impersonal technical jargon of
many sci-ﬁ stories.

“Sci-ﬁ is mostly gadgets and
gimmicks,” he said. “There are
very few people in sci-ﬁ."

Dracula Rises Again -- Annotated

By PATTY TASCARELLA

The Annotated Dracula

Dracula by Bram Stoker
Introduction and Bibliography by
Leonard Wolfe

Ballantine Books

It goes without saying “The
Annotated Dracula” is only meant
for the true Dracophile. Not only
does this book contain the complete

text of Bram Stoker's novel, but
Leonard Wolfe added a bibliogra-
phy, so the subleties of the book
are drawn out.

Wolfe’s footnotes include com-
ments from Sigmund Freud,
literary references from Shake-
speare, and a history of vampire in
general.

As everyone knows, Dracula
himslef can be traced back to a
Rumanian ruler named Vlad the

wave. Some of it is good and will
last, and a lot of it is no good and will
disappear. There’s just as much
junk in the new wave as there was in
the old music.”

Johnny hopes The Ramones will
make it through the new wave as
The Beatles made it through the last
big wave of young rock groups. The
verdict is in at Antonino’s: The
Ramones have made it.

Stoker's “Dracula” was ﬁrst
published in 1897. and made its
first movie appearance in the 1922
German ﬁlm, “Nosferatu."

The_movie version most people
are familiar with is Tod Browning’s
1931 ﬁlm “Dracula,” in which Bela
Lugosi said those now-immortal
words—“I vant to drink your
blood.” From there, hundreds of
vampire ﬁlms have been made,
most with John Carradine or
Christdpher Lee portraying Dra-
cula. Basically, the quality has
dropped considerably since the

Browing version. The ﬁlms have
included such notable items as the

Chiller Theater staple “Billy the ‘

Kid Meets Dracula" and Andy

Warhol's three-dimensional X-

rated rendition in 1974.

Besides charting the film history
of Dracula, Wolfe includes a

‘calendar that dutifully recounts the ‘

events of the Stoker story.

Wolfe’s footnotes ﬂesh out the 

original story

Did Patemo Bluff Way Into, Orange Bowl?-

The Orange Bowl says it isn’t so, but someone
close (close, as in bride to groom) to the confused
situation surrounding the only undecided major bid
says Penn State coach Joe Paterno nixed an offer
from Miami that would have put the Pitt-Penn
State winner in the Orange Bowl against the Big
Eight champion.

Another deal vetoed by Paterno, according to the
source, would have put the Pitt-Penn State loser in

V the Liberty Bowl. “The Liberty folks would have

gone for it,” the source said, “but Patemo
wouldn’t do it.”

Patemo, who by all published accounts has the
inside track with the Orange Bowl committee, may
have thereby set the Sun upon Pitt, setting up a
Panther-LSU matchup in El Paso, Texas Dec. 31.
And that must disappoint Pitt coach Jackie Sherrill,
who believes the Nittany Lions should wait until af-
ter Nov. 26 to take a bid to a major bowl.

He believes his team is better than Venn State,
will defeat the Lions Nov. 26 and therefore deser-
ves the Orange Bowl bid.

It was suggested to the Pitt head coach by at least
one bowl that Sherrill should call Paterno and
remind him of the fairness and logic that mandate a
Pitt-Penn State winner be assured a good bid, but
Sherrill says he has not made any such call. He also
said a published report that had Sherrill making the
challenge a public matter was incorrect.

But, according to the source, the challenge was
made—by the Orange Bowl. “The Orange Bowl
committee wanted to wait,” he said, “but Paterno
wouldn’t go along with it. He called their bluff.

“They wanted to see which team won, but Pater-
no said he’s make no deal involving Pitt.”

Citing Paterno’s animosity toward Pitt, ac-
cumulated during the Majors era and culminating
with Pitt’s waltz to a national championship, the
source said Penn State instead made a deal with

Arkansas that had either the Hogs or Lions——the

choice was left to the Orange—playing in Miami ’

and the other team committed to the Fiesta Bowl.

Arkansas’ players voted recently to go to the
Fiesta Bowl if an Orange bid is not extended their
way. Pitt officials are not expecting to get a major
bid, subscribing to the theory that puts Penn State
in the Orange Bowl. And a University Park travel
agent was reported to be in Miami yesterday, setting
up a tour.’

 

But, said a member of the Orange Bowl selection
committee last night, Lion fans need not pack their
flight bags yet. At least, he said, they should wait
until Saturday to tie on the destination tags.

“Everyone thinks they have it all figured out,”
he said by telephone from Miami. “But I’m telling
the truth when I say it’s not completely settled. I
thought I knew who we’d invite a week ago, but
I’m not so sure tonight.

“We have met several times for extended periods
and we’ll meet again Thursday afternoon,” he ad-
ded, “but the only thing we’ve voted to do is to ex-
tend on the 19th. If Jackie Sherrill and Pittsburgh
think they’re out of it, I think that’s premature. No

team has a clear majority on this committee.”

Some Orange Bowl members still give some con-
sideration to the Big 10 runnerup, though it is
almost certain that team will meet Alabama and a
happy (because he thinks he’ll win this one) Bear

Bryant in the Sugar Bowl.

Others like Arkansas, which likely will bring a 10-
1 record to its bowl. But Orange selection commit-
tee chairman Bob Lafferty already has expressed a
preference for Penn State, and most, if not all,
published and spoken accounts have him getting
what he wants.

“Penn State is money in the bank to the Orange
Bowl Committee,” a Miami sports writer told The
Pitt News. “Penn State and the Orange Bowl
people are close socially, and Penn State has done
well here. Every indication we have points to Penn
State getting the invitation. But there’s still the Pitt
game.”

And so we’re back to Pitt and Penn State. Jackie
Sherrill, who has nursed private disappointment
while staying relatively quiet, and Joe Paterno,
whose only comment to anyone except the Orange
Bowl committee has been “no comment.”

Paterno has talked often in the past about
“what’s good for eastern football,” probably since
his team was the only decent team in 12 states for
some time and what was good for Penn‘State was
good for “eastern football.”

But Pitt has affected that phrase recently,
because having the best eastern team—the winner
of the Pitt-Penn State game-—-in a major bowl is not
only good for eastern football, but also Pitt’s only
hope this year.

“Paterno’s talked about eastern football a lot,”
said a source well-versed in the ways of eastern
football. “But apparently it doesn’t matter where
Penn State is concerned. They should wait, but it’s
up to them now and Paterno won’t make a deal
unless he’s forced into it.”

But the only folks able to exert the kind of
pressure that could move Joe Paterno are in Miami
now, and they’ve already heard his answer. The

 

 

question then becomes, will they take it?

Give Pitt Liberty, Or Whatever

By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL

Pitt News Staff Writer

“As much as we” enjoy the
bowls themselves,” said one
member of a major bowl committee
yesterday, ‘ ‘I think this speculation
in the newspapers is more fun than
we ever have down here. I just can't
wait to pick up my morning paper
and see which team we’ve invited
today.”

The NCAA-imposed fact is that
no bowl has invited any team yet, at
least not officially. But several have
already been decided at bowl
committee meetings and those
decisions will be announced some-
where around 6:01 p.m. Saturday,
right after the NCAA says “Go!”

And while several teams’ holiday
vacation spots have already been
chosen, many other teams, in-
cluding Pitt’s 8-1-1 Panthers, are

Pitt last night was said by a Gator
Bowl source to be ' headed for
Jacksonville (Friday night, Dec. 31)

hopes go unfulﬁlled. But Jackie

- Sherrill has spoken to folks in El

Paso, Texas, recently about the Sun
Bowl (Dec. 30) and someone from

polo ea ve no hpe of bettering last

Memphis called the Pitt band
selling hotel rooms the other day, so
the Sun and Liberty (Dec. 19) also
may feature Pitt. The Gator, which
had been said to be rejected by Pitt,
now may be the Panthers’ best bet.

Both the Sun and Liberty are
reported ready to extend an
invitation to Pitt. The Orange Bowl,
contrary to belief in the Pitt athletic

department, still is not completely
sold on Penn State and still offers
Pitt a faint chance at a Jan. 2 bowl.

A chance to faint is what everyone
will get if Notre Dame does not
accept a Cotton Bowl bid and the
Big 10 runnerup a Sugar Bowl bid
before the clock hits 6:02 Saturday
evening.

AnOrange Bowl source was eager

to learn last night whether the
Sugar Bowl had the Big 10’s
number-two team locked up.

“We’d like to know one way

another, but they won’t tell us,’ ’ he
said. “We are still interested, since
the Big 10 is an _attractive
commodity, but we keep hearing
the Sugar Bowl has them.”

“I’d say you’re on the right track
if you put the Big 10 runnerup in the
Sugar,” a Sugar Bowl selection
committee member told The Pitt
News last night.

“We also have heard that the
Orange Bowl is going to go with
Penn State Nov. 19, and we’re
pretty sure the Cotton is taking
Notre Dame,” he added.

“But we have a pretty good game
ourselves.”

Poloists Hopes for Ranking Sunk

By BOB LABRIOLA

l’t'I 'Vc\\s Stall’ \\ Htcv

Sunday’s 21-20 sudden death
overtime loss to Bucknell snuffed
any remaining hopes of a national
ranking for Pitt’s water polo team.

Because of the large effect the
‘NCAA tournament has on the ﬁnal
rankings, the Panthers, despite
their slow start, still had an
excellent chance to ﬁnish in the top
ﬁve in the country, if Pitt had won
the Eastern Championship and
received the bid.

Pitt was leading in the ﬁnal
match with Bucknell, 16-14, with
1:18 to play in regulation time, then
mysteriously folded up like a card
table in allowing the Bisons to
score twice and send it into
overtime.

“If someone had come up to me
when we were ahead by two with
1:18 left. and said that we would
lose. I would've bet my neck
against it." said Miguel Rivera.
That's how conﬁdent lwas. But. if]

“With 18 seconds lett we were
still ahead by a goal, 16-15, so I
called a timeout so we could call a
play and kill the rest of the time,”
Rivera continued. “When the ball
was put in play Mike (Mere) was
open on the side, but the goalie
(Steve Feller) tried to force the ball
to (George) Machicote, and
Bucknell made the steal.”

Despite the disappointment in-
volved in missing the NCAA
tournament, and losing four of ﬁve
matches with the Bisons, this
season, Rivera maintained an
optimistic proﬁle. '

"Sure, I’m unhappy we lost the
match, but I’m pleased with the
way the guys turned it around after
our slow start." Rivera said. “One
or two mistakes by individuals at
critical times hurt us. You could
describe us the same way the
Steelers were in 1974: We were
super. but missed the bowl."

Pitt placed six players on the
all-East team, twice as many as

Feller received honorable mention

“I was deﬁnitely surprised to

at the Conference Champion-
ships."

“Matches like the one for the

committee is divided, though Penn
State is the favorite. A deal was
reported that had Penn State and
Arkansas vying for the Orange bid
with the “loser” settling for a
Fiesta Bowl invitation.

The teams that appeared to be
set, aside from Notre Dame and the
Big 10 runnerup, are:

North Carolina, which is said to
have accepted a Liberty Bowl
invitation; probably to take on the
Big Eight runnerup;

‘mlemson, which is said to be in
the Gator Bowl with Pitt, Florida St.
(which has the governor of Florida

pulling for it) or the Big Eight
runnerup;

 

Arkansas, which sees its Orange
Bowl hopes almost ended by
NBC-TV officials who want to
televise a less regional game and
which probably will take the
players’ second choice, the Fiesta
Bowl, which will also feature
Arizona St.;

LSU, which will play in the Sun
Bowl against Pitt or a conference
runnerup;

North Carolina St., which will
take four losses to the Peach Bowl,
which likes Florida St., and

interesting team because of the
recent lobbying Florida’s governor,
a FSU alumnus, has done on its
behalf with Gator Bowl officials.

“I understand he’s getting in the
act,” said an official from another
Florida bowl who asked not to be
identified. “The governor lives,
works and is an alumnus up there,
and he wants to see them in the
Gator Bowl. But if I know the folks
at the Gator, they won’t yield to the
pressure.

“That is pretty good pressure,
though,” he continued after a
moment of thought. “Coming for
the governor and all.

“It’s amazing how folks get ‘all
worked up over this stuff.”

One passing quarterback down,
another one to go.

If the Pitt defensive football team
were to keep a tally sheet from
week to week, that’s the way this
week’s sheet might read.

Last week, the Pitt .defense
concentrated most of its attention
in practice and team meetings, in
an effort to halt Army quarterback
Leamon Hall. Pitt was able to stop
Hall enough to register an
impressive 52-26 win over the
Cadets Saturday at Meadowlands
Stadium in East Rutherford, New
Jersey.

Practice resumes today, follow-
ing a two-day lay off and the
Panther defense again will divert
most of its attention this week and
next week to stop yet another
machine gun-armed quarterback,
Chuck Fusina. The junior from
Sto-Rox High School will lead
eighth-ranked Penn State for its
nationally televised game with the
Panthers into Pitt Stadium Nov. 26.

However, trying to stop Fusina
may be a tougher assignment than
trying to stop Hall. Fusina,
considered by many to be perhaps
the best quarterback in the
talent-rich East, heads an offense
far superior to the one Hall guided
into Saturday’s game between
Army and Pitt.

Pitt will have to keep open more
for than just Fusina’s passing.

“We won’t begin practice until
Wednesday,” Pitt linebacker Jeff
Pelusi said shortly after Saturday’s
Pitt-Army game. “So, we haven’t
really seen any film on them. But
with Fusina back there, you can be
sure we’ll be concentrating on pass
defense again.”

Pelusi knows he’ll have his work
cut out for him when he faces
Fusina and the rest of the Penn
State offense in less than two
weeks.

Snacking on Some Sports Tidbits

Playing linebacker against a
passing quarterback like Hall or
Fusina means added responsibili-
ties for the sophomore from
Youngstown, Ohio.

“We have to be quicker on pass
drops,” Pelusi explained. “We
have to get back quicker to stop the
pass.”

Pelusi ﬁgures the Pitt defense
will have to be a lot quicker in a lot
of other areas, too.

“We’ve been starting slowly in
most of our games,” Pelusi said. “I
don't know why, but we haven't
been getting the real quick start in
our games so far.

“Saturday, we started out the
same way,” Pelusi continued. “In
the beginning of the game, we
were playing man-to-man coverage
against Army. It took a while for
our defensive secondary to get
going. But once we caught on, we
did all right, and started stopping
their routes over the middle.

“We began to realize the only
way they could move the football
was by passing it. We gave them
no openings. They couldn’t run.”

The Nittany Lions supposedly
have one of the better attacks in
their illustrious school history.
They not only have a guy who can
pass the football in Fusina, they
have people who can run the
football, Matt Suhey and Bob
Torrey, and people who can catch
the football, Mickey Shuler and
Jimmy Cefalo. Both Shuler and
Cefalo went over the 1,000-yard
career passing mark last Saturday,
in Penn State’s 44-7 washout of
Temple.

“We still won’t know about them
until we watch the films,” Pelusi
concluded.

Pitt, in the meantime, will be out
to complete its tally sheet
defensively. Chuck Fusina is next
on the list.

 

If some writing is food for thought, here are some
very light snacks:

Considering the truly remarkable job he’s done
with the Pitt defense this year—in the wake of both a
decimating graduation and a seemingly endless string
 injuries——Panther defensive coordinator Jimmy
’,hnson would seem a ripe candidate for a head
coaching position somewhere next year. Love to see
him stay, though.

Randy Holloway will be one of the first 12 players
drafted by the NFL in May, and will be closely
followed in the first round by teammate Matt
Cavanaugh. Unfortunately for Holloway, who leads
the Panthers in both tackles and sacks despite con-
stant double-teaming, Ross Browner will most un-
deservedly win the Outland Trophy. Playing for
Notre Dame, perhaps the most charistmatic of all
football teams, will help Browner, but his biggest
asset is that he won the trophy last year. (Matt

  
   
   
   

  

   
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
   
    
   
  
   
  
    
    
 
  

 " Carroll ate Browner alive in the Pitt-Notre Dame

game in September-)

Why Randy Holloway is a Kansas City Chiefs fan
defies explanation.

Julius Erving may well be the most spectacular
player the NBA has ever showcased. His new coach,
Billy Cunningham, played with the same
freewheeling, unpredictable style, and probably will
turn the good Doctor loose. This will give the 76ers
at least some sense of what they’re doing on offense.
Last year, everybody but Henry Bibby often seemed
to be lost on the court. After all, who better than
Julius Erving to build an offense around?

, Elliot Walker has been simply outstanding for Pitt
this year. It is his running talents in particular that

force Pitt opponents to play the run. When that

happens, Cavanaugh and Gordon Jones take over.

Baseball free agent Rich Gossage, reliever extraor-
dinaire, will sign with the California Angels. As a
direct result, Nolan Ryan and Frank Tahana will
combine for 50 to 55 wins next season.

Speaking of free agents, if Richie Zisk——a solid,
though by no means spectacular, hitter--is worth
$2.5 million over 10 years, what would Cincinnati’s
George Foster’s price be? Foster is a much better
power hitter, hits for a higher average, can both out-

 

field and outthrow Zisk, and is a faster runner.
(Foster, the National League’s Most Valuable Player
last season, hit 52 home runs, drove in 149 and bat-
ted .324.)

Perhaps the case that most strikingly shows the ex-
tremes to which the baseball free agent market has
gone is that of Doc Medich, who pitched poorly for
the Pirates in 1976, and poorly for the Oakland
Athletics, Seattle Mariners and New York Mets in
1977. Medich jumped into the free-agent pool and
was rewarded with a cool million for four years. The
philanthropist behind the upswing in both Zisk’s and
Medich’s fortunes is Texas Ranger owner Brad Cor-
bett, a man whose idol is obviously Yankee owner
George Steinbrenner.

The Steelers will beat Dallas, 17-13-, Sunday, and
will go on to win the Central division.

Howard Cosell is a banal personification of ver-
bosity run amuck; he exemplifies the abysmal depth
to which announcers are capable of sinking when
they elect to eschew any semblance of sports
knowledge and rational thinking, and insist upon an
endless stream of uniformed, pointless elucidation.

Howard Cosell talks too much and knows too lit-
tle.

Anyone who tries to blame Jackie Sherrill for
Pitt’s being 8-l-l instead of 10-0 is carefully
choosing to forget Sherrill is the main reason Pitt
recruited many of the extremely talented freshmen
who have made a good football team into a great
one.

Bill Walton is the most complete center in the
NBA today. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar cannot be
touched in sheer ability to score, but Walton re-
bounds as well or better, is a more aggressive defen-
der and shot-blocker, is without peer as a passer,
generates the fast break quicker than anyone, and is
in a class all his own as a team player.

Pitt will beat Penn State, 27-10, dominatingthe
game on defense and exploiting the Nittanies’ weak
pass defense. Despite Joe Paterno’s claim that this
year’s bunch from Happy Valley might be his best
ever, they have not had to face the adversity Pitt has

this year.‘ This is important, because Pitt has not ‘

only faced adversity but has blasted through it,
gaining in the process a confidence in both the star-
ters and reserves. Playing in Pitt Stadium won’t hurt
Pitt’s chances, either,

Cowboy Tony Returns g

PITTSBURGH (AP)—-Million-
dollar rookie Tony Dorsett of the
Dallas Cowboys is bringing his own
fans to watch him play against the
Pittsburgh Steelers Sunday.

“l’ve ordered 50 tickets but I
found out today I need 60 to 100,”
Dorsett said Tuesday.

“I can't wait to get home,”
added Dorsett, a native of nearby
Aliquippa. “I hope I play well. Of
course, I always hope I play well. 
But there's something different
about it when you’re going home.”

Dorsett, a Heisman Trophy
winner with the University of
Pittsburgh in 1977, shares the
Cowboy’s leading running back
position with former Steeler Pres-
ton Pearson.

Although he leads the Cowboys
in rushing with 522 yards in 112
carries, Coach Tom Landry has
never put Dorsett in the starting

‘‘I can’t tell you how Landry is
thinking. I hope he’l1 start me
Sunday,” Dorsett said.

Dorsett’s wish may come true.
Landry said at a press conference
that there is a possibility Dorsett
might start in the game against the
5-4 Steelers, replacing the veteran
Pearson, who has rushed for 298
yards on 80 carries this season.

“We’re not positive on it, but it
might happen,” Landry said.

“We haven’t made a deﬁnite
decision, but Tony will continue to
play more.”

Early in the season Dorsett had
difficulty getting accustomed to the
complex Dallas offense. He says
it’s second nature to him now.

“I worked on it before and after
practice for weeks. I just
concentrated more on catching the
ball with my hands instead of

lineup.

“I thought I’d be starting by now
but things haven't worked out that
way. lt’s hard sometimes to come
.off the bench.

Former Pitt superback Tony Dorsett returns as a Dallas
Cowboy Sunday when the NFC leaders will clash with the
Pittsburgh Steelers. It will be the first game Dorsett has

played in P tsburgh since last year’s Pitt-Penn t. e-

Evolution

By Peter J. Butch

More than 300 years ago, when
Shakespeare was poetically postulating
what phases homo sapiens passed
through on the way to the grave, he
found it easy to breaklife down to seven

gas of men, and a classic was born.

Today, in Oakland, life is not so sim-
ple. in half a decade students go
through four ages—freshman,
sophomore, junior and senior. The first
three each have a one year duration’ and
the last lingers until the individual has
the good fortune to rack up 1 20 credits.

These phases hardly blend together;
they’re as different as Pennsylvania
legislators and scrupulous scout-
masters. For instance, no senior would
want his daughter to marry a freshman.
And you'll never catch a freshman
reading over the shoulder of a junior.

The average freshman reads Mad
magazine, the sophomore, National

dipoon, the junior, Esquire, and the-

senior, Mad magazine.

All four read the comic pages. The
freshman identifies with Linus, the
sophomore, Spiderman, the junior,
Mike Doonesbury and the senior,
Chester the Molester. .

in study, as well as in reading, the
college junior is the epitome of student
intellectualism. Alas, every shred of
common sense acquired in three years

is knocked away like duck pins at the
onset of the senior year. ‘

 l You Thought

tlve interest in some corporate
monopoly while consistently main-
taining—with a straight face—the
politics of Marxist professors have
nothing to do with the denial of tenure.

That brings to mind the Tenure Game,
the requirements of which are that
dedicated teachers sacrifice their
private lives, integrity and their

poo

teaching, to fight interdepartmental bat-
tles for a contract. Some players have
claimed that the Tenure Game often
requires a player be white and male, but
if those are the rules, we’ve never seen
them written down anywhere.

The Pitt Game is played in sequen-
ces that are often meant to correspond
to intellectual and emotional maturation,
but most often correspond to increased
depression, disillusionment and
recurring acne. The first sequence is
often the easiest—a potential player
must fill out a form, answering a few
questions like what you want to do
when you grow up. It's difficult, but you
could answer one of the questions
wrong——for instance, ‘‘I want to be a
state legislator when I grow up”—which
means you’ll be shifted to some ob-
scure branch campus where you will
play another game called How to get to
Main Campus.

The Pitt Game includes several sub-
games. One of the most basic is the
Where I'll Live Game that offers three
options with corresponding prizes for
the winners and losers. One loser of
the Dormitory Option was awarded a
hard of hearing roommate who owned
all the Hudson Brothers albums. Other

players opt for the L lying at Home Game,

the losers of which are forced to repeat
,‘(until they believe it): .“Just because I
jhave to be in bed at 11 p.m. doesn’t
‘mean I’m not independentl” Apartment
Dweller Game players compete with

admires it, the junior is amused by it and
the senior runs for it.

Freshmen take summer courses
because they don’t want to go back
home and work. Sophomores have a
boyfriend or girlfriend studying all sum-
mer, juniors take summer courses

because they want to enrich their‘

-background and seniors take them
because they want to graduate.

Freshmen are going steady with a
boyfriend or girlfriend back home,
sophomores are engaged to be married
upon graduation, juniors jugglethree or
four boyfriends or girlfriends and
seniors wonder if they'll ever have a
social life again.

The veteran Pitt student learns all the
shortcuts. The freshman buys his
books in the first week of August, the
sophomore waits three hours in line at
the bookstore on the first day of
classes. The junior has it timed perfec_-
tly. He saunters into the bookstore the
Friday before Labor Day. The senior
stumbles into class for the first time in
early October and fibs he just add-
dropped the course and can't find the
text.

,Most freshmen want to be doctors,
most sophomores want to be lawyers,
most juniors want to be marketing
analysts with an advanced degree in
business administration. Most seniors
wantajob.

Freshmen think Wesley Posvar is
God, sophomores are agnostics, juniors
are atheists and seniors know the
assistant CAS dean for graduation,
Rhea Bass, is God.

Tastebuds take a beating in four

. years. Freshmen drink Hop ’n’ Gator,
sophomores drink Iron City, juniors
drink Heineken and seniors take

 

 Ill’, J3]: .

whatever is on special at the Original.

Freshmen complain about cafeteria
food, sophomores tolerate it, juniors are
resigned to eating it and seniors go
back for second helpings.

The sense of humor refines with age.
Freshmen laugh at their professor's
jokes, sophomores laugh in the face of
danger and juniors laugh at Steve Martin
albums played for the 307th con-
secutive time. Seniors laugh at nothing.

Freshmen save their extra money to
buy a Corvette, sophomores scrimp for
a TR-7, juniors covet 1964. Mustang
convertibles and seniors make down
payments, on gray 1971 Belvederes
with black vinyl roofs.

On Mom's birthday, frehsmen ask for
money, sophomores call collect, juniors
say it with flowers and seniors send her
a Veg-o-matic.

The grass is always greener on the
other side of the fence. Freshmen can’t
wait to be seniors, sophomores can’t
wait to be seniors, juniors can’t wait to
be seniors. Seniors wish they were
freshmen again.

each other in several ways, picking up
points for not sleeping, having parties in
which furniture is destroyed and police
make appearances, allowing food to
turn into strange green entities in the
refrigerator and, of course, the size of
one’s cockroach colony. Each of these
games do have winners, who get to ad-
vance through various point categories,
like Shadyside and Squirrel Hill.

One game that comes up more often‘
than Where I'll Live is the Rites of
Registration, much like the Rites of
Passage since it involves both
maturation and a pain similar to being
circumcised. The Rites‘ of Registration
are otherwise known ‘as the Match
Game (trying to match your schedule
with the available classes) and the Gong
Show (what you would like to do to the

35 people standing in front of you in

the registration line).

Once you make it through the ob-
stacles of registration, you can take
your CER form, your special permission
slips and your Add/Drop form, and ad-
vance to the Add-Drop Game.
Professors, playing their own Tenure
and Promotion Game, will love playing
the Go Ahead and Beg Me to Let You in-
to My Class Runaround Game, while
you will play But I'm a Senior and I Need
the Class to Graduate Game.

Playing Teacher must be lots of fun.
Players, astute and concerned, go
through Testing Trials, Paper Politics,
and Grading Games over and‘ again
every four months. -Players designated
Teacher win points for sentences
without pauses, . while players
designated Student win points for
yawns without pauses. Teachers get to
play" the graded curve option as well,
which requires they stand at the top of a
stairway, tests in hand, and toss them
with a decided flair, giving B's to those
that land face up, and F's to those that
land face down. A's go to the tests that
stand up on their sides. '

There are few rules for another
game, called the Study Game. Par-
ticipants progress through the game by
making declarations such as ‘‘I am going
to study for eighthours tonight" or ‘‘I am
never going out again until my paper is
done."

The Social Game and the Study
Game are a matched set, the former
eating up the latter as the years
progress. The Social Game has sub-
games as well, including the I'm Going
to Party Until My Fingernails Fall‘ Off
game, the No, I’m not 21 Yet Game and
the Paul/Paula Pick-Up Party Game.

Playing the Graduation Game is one
of the hardest games of all, since not
only do you have to accumulate 120
credits, but you have to remember to
graduate. You see, that is part of the
game. If you forget to register for
graduation, you will have to go around
again, and again, and everytime you
pass go,_you lose $2,000.

Ron N yswaner and Lisa Rubenstein
have played the Pitt Game for four
years, are mad as hell and -aren’t going
to take it anymore.
