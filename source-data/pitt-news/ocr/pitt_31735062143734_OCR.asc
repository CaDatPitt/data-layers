Glee Club To
Compete In
Pa. Contest

Eight Colleges Expected to
be Represented at
Philadelphia

-Group Leaves Thursday

Preparatory to entering the state
division of the National University
Glee Club competition, the Glee Club
is practicing the three numbers spec-
iﬁed by the national contest commit-
tee for presentation at Philadelphia,
Friday evening, March 17.

The songs are: “Ave Maria,” by Ar-
cadelt; “Now Sleeps the Crimson
Petal,” by Andrews. and “The Broken
Melody,” by Sibelius. From these
three numbers one will be selected to
be sung that evening. Many of Phil-
adelphia’s most prominent musically
interested citizens will be present at
the contest and from this group the
judges will be chosen. One of them

will also be cnosen to draw the con-
test song from the above three.

Eight Pennsylvania colleges are ex-
pected to compete for the state cham-
pionship. The winner of this contest
will represent Pennsylvania in the
national competition in New York
City at a later date. The winner of
the national contest at New York will
tour Europe.

Each glee club is limited to thirty
voices and Dr. Walter H. Wright,
director of the University group, is
having some difﬁculty in choosing the
thirty out of the sixty» members
under him, to represent the Univer-
sity. The deﬁnite choices will not
be known until a day or two before
the time of departure. As each group
must have a college student as its
leader, it has been announced that
James Holland, Bus. Ad. ’34, presi-
dent of our Glee Club, will take over
the directing duties. Earl A. Zimber,
Ed. '33, business manager of the club.

The University group will leave by
bus next Thursday and will stay
that night in Gettysburg, where it
will give a concert. The members will
leave the next morning for Philadel-
phia. The Saturday morning follow-
ing the contest they will leave Phila-
phia.

This will be the ﬁrst time the Uni-
versity Glee Club has taken part in
the contest since it was last held here
in Pittsburgh several years back. No
contest was held last year, but the
one held in 1931 was won by Penn
State.

Pitt Team Opposes North
Carolina Today

One of the Men’s Debating Associa-
tion’s best audiences, the Pittsburgh
Advertising Club, will hear a discus-
sion of the war debt question at noon
today, when a team from the Univer-
sity of North Carolina will meet Saul
Shapira, Col. ’34, and Edwin Banks,
Col. ’35.

The debate will take place in the
club room at William Penn Hotel
with the Pitt men supporting the neg- '
ative.

Six speakers, three from the Asso-
ciation and three from Georgetown
University, featured a debate last
Sunday night on the same topic at
the East End Christian Church. John
Bracken, Col. ’34; John Torrence,
Col. ’34, and Leonard Boreman, Col.
'33, argued the affirmative side for
Pitt.

At the East Liberty YMCA last
Saturday night, another inter-col1e-
giate contest took place, two men
from New York University this time
contending with Israel Golberg, Col.
'36, and Shapira on the cancellation
question.

On March 10 two Pitt teams travel-
ed to McKees Rocks where they dis-
cussed the war debt problem again
before the Chamber of Commerce of
that borough. Norman Landy, Col.
’34, and Boreman favored cancellation,
while Abe Bonder, Col. ’34, and Gold-
berg argued for revision.

Players Mimic “Big

A variety of interests absorb the
time of the Pitt Players while Mr.
Carl B. Cass, director rearranges his
“Minick” cast during its ﬁrst week of
rehearsal. Several parts. of this
comedy by George S, Kaufman and
Edna Ferber are difficult to cast and
Mr. Cass has been experimenting thus
far. Inelegibility among the women
chosen for p-arts has left several va-
cancies which must be reﬁlled. A

complete cast should be announced,
however, within the week.

Out of town patrons of the one-act

plays have shown an interest in the
work of the Play Production class as
is evidenced by the fact that several
of the plays have been requested for
off-campus performances.

In Rehearsal

of Men. Necessary

approximately 375 men, William Mar-

“By Friday,” Walter J. Rome, as-
sistant dean of men said, “the men
chosen for the revue will be deﬁnitely
approved, with their scholastic stand-
ing and quality point average checked.
Unitil the candidates are passed by
the dean’s office, the cast named will

be merely tentative.”-

At the rehearsal tonight, the sched-
ule for subsequent meetings of the
chorus and the cast will be decided.
Ordinary routine, if followed this year,
will involve three afternoon practices
for the chorus, and at least two more
for cast members.

Work for the chorus will not be so
rigorous this year as last, Marlatt de-
clares. The bulk of singing, acting,
and dancing will fall upon the cast, he
said, since “Pittsburgh in 1787 and the
Founding of the University” will be
even more music—ﬁlled than the “Sil-
ver Domino” of 1932.

Staffs of the show, it was an-
nounced, will begin work simultane-
ously with the players. Production,
business, and advertising groups are
planning organization and prelimi-
nary activities immediately. As with
the cast and the chorus, however, the
deﬁnite list of staff members has not
been drawn up.

Association’s Dance New

Set for March 31

The justly indignant spirit of that
very venerable Irishman, jolly old St.
Patrick, in righteous wrath at having
the sacredness of March 17 deﬁled
by the hey nonny nonnies and the
hot cha chas of modern collegiate
rythym, waved his gnarled shillalah
over the fate of Pitt dances and,
presto, the College Association’s ﬁrst
affair of ye school year, 1933, jumps
ahead to March 31.

Although the Association’s ﬁrst
dance of the current semester has
been buffeted about the campus social
calendar until the officers are dizzy
announcing new dates, it has now
been deﬁnitely decided to present the
informal on the Friday night so re-
cently vacated by the army function
of the year. T

As arranged for the St. Patrick's
day dance, Bill Leroy will present his
ten Tattlers and furnish the melody
for the dance. The scene of the
festivities, the Hotel Schenley, has
not been changed.

Despite the fact that there will be
no Irish shamrocks or Erin colleens
to color the Association's ﬁrst presen-
tation, the sale of memberships, good
for both the formal and the informal
dances, promises a full house, The
memberships, limited to 300, are ob-
tainable for $2.00 at the College of-

ﬁce, 205 State Hall.

AICE Hears
E. J. Sullivan

To Discuss Chemical War at
Seminar Thursday

“General Aspects of Chemical En-
gineering in Warfare” and “The Pro-
tection of Chemical Agents” are the
subjects that will be treated at 11:30
Thursday morning at the regular
weekly seminar meeting of the Ameri-
can Institute of Chemical Engineers
by Lieut. E. J. Sullivan of the Chemi-
cal Warfare Service. The meeting
will take place in the Upper Dental
Building.

Last Thursday, Lieut. D. C. Treden-
nick of the University ROTC depart-
ment addressed the group informally
on various phases of an army stay in
Hawaii. Lieut. Tredennick spoke of
experiences met by army men in
Hawaii, the social status of the men,
and told of a few interesting and
amusing episodes of his trip, includ-
ing an account of a hike up a few
of Hawaii's principle volcanos.

According to Harold Kennedy, ’33,
president of the AICE, seminar meet-
ings this semester will follow an en-
tirely new policy. Instead of a series
of technical talks relating purely to
the chemical engineering profession,
the schedule includes a number of
cultural and educational lectures
which are intended to give under-
graduates a broader and more varied
knowledge of conditions, events, peo-
ple, and places. “We feel that we
get enough chem engineering in
class,” he pointed out, “and in our

seminars we want to hear a little of '

what’s going on outside of our own

ﬁeld.”

German Club Meeting
Friday; Elect Officers

The German Club, sponsored by the
instructors of German classes, re-
sumes activities next Friday in room

_315 Alumni Hall, at 1:00 o’clock dur-

ing drill hour.

This is the ﬁrst meeting of the Ger-
man students this semester.

Election of officers will be the main
feature of this meeting. Clarissa
Fricke, Ed. ’34, temporary president of
the group, will deliver a short talk
concerning the organization of the
German clubs on the Yale Campus.
Other attractions on the program in-
clude native German songs and Ger-
man folk songs, As an added induce-
ment, William Potter. Ed. '33, will con-
tribute popular German stories of
funny situations, unusual answers,
and silly snapshots. At the close of

the program, refreshments will be
served.
All students attending German

classes are urged to come, as this pro-
gram is of utmost interest to anybody
who has an understanding of the Ger-
man language.

Organized. for State
Social Legislation

Is City Chairman Also

 

Recently chosen chairman of the
Allegheny county committee for the
Pennsylvania State Security League,
additional honor came to Dr. Ralph
A. Turner, of the history department
when he was elected chairman of the
«executive committee of the league
at a state meeting last week in Har-
risburg. 

With Dr. Turner on the committee
are faculty members of the larger
colleges in the state, representatives
from local committees of charitable
and church welfare organizations, and
representatives of the more important
state labor organizations. Commit-
tee memberships number 26.

The purpose of the league is to ob-
tain a state-wide membership large
enough to influence state legislation
into passing laws for old age pensions,
a mimimum wage law for women and
minors, and unemployment insurance.
Membership of the executive commit-
tee is drawn from local groups made
up of representatives of three groups
represented in the state committee.
The registration of the Pittsburgh
and Allegheny county committee is
approximately 8,000 members.

In commenting on the work of the
executive committee, Dr. Turner said
yesterday that the major duty of his
committee was to correlate the work
of the local committees that they
might have a cohesive organization,
rather than have several incongruent
district committees. That the work
of the league might be more efficient-
ly conducted, Dr. Turner said was the
ma.in reason that the executive com-
mittee was organized.

lnquiry Hears
Religious Talk

Father Cratz Leads Third
Discussion Tomorrow

 

The ﬁnal discussion of contempor-
ary religion, an answer to “What Is
Catholicism?” will be presented be-
fore the Inquiry Forum tomorrow at
12:30 o’clock by Father Sigmund
Cratz of De Paul Institute, Brookline.

Tomorrow’s talk will be the third
of a series. Last week Rev. David
Lang of the Shady Avenue Presbyte-
rian Church set forth the doctrines of
Protestantism and pointed out the dif-
-rences between Protestant and
Catholic faiths from the point of
view of Protestantism. The previous
week Rabbi B. B. Glazer of the Rodef
-Shalom Congregation set forth the
tenets of Judaism.

The three-week religious symposi-
um, says Rudolph Morgan, president
of the Inquiry Forum Committee, will
be followed next week and the Wed-
nesday following ‘by speeches on the
current situation in Germany. An-
other date deﬁnitely settled and prom-
ised as a feature event is the after-
’noon of April 19, when Harold W. Co-
hen, “Post-Gazette” movie critic, will
discuss the modern motion picture.

Atheism, too, will have its share-
of attention within several weeks. A
disbeliever prominent on the campus
will be secured to expound his view
of life. Other talks in the Inquiry
series will deal with the mid-west
-farm situation and with art and paint-
: ing.

Because- of the. unrepresentative

- Friday. to- decide-. upon the new book-

type of diploma, seniors. in these

. schools are-to be asked to voice their

preference as they apply at the

Graduating classes in the Schools

. of Engineers and Mines, Business Ad-

ministration, and the Graduate School

_ have already expressed their com-

plete approval, acc_ording~ to J. G.
Quick, registrar. Despite the disap-
proval of the College and School of
Education, the other schools so
strongly. favored it, that the vote is
more than three to one in its. favor.
The diploma, is prepared on sheep-

skin, 8- by 10 inches,-‘and is an exact
facsimile of the original larger wall
size. It is to ﬁt into a folder of blue
morocco leather, lined inside with
silk moire. The folder will have the
student's name engraved: in gold leaf
on the. outs-ide.

Deans Sieg, Holbrook, and Arm-
bruster have already expressed their
approval of it. Their attitude, in gen-.
eral, has been that the student will
be able to keep the diploma intact in
a dust-proof folder.

Recent trends in schools through-
out the country h-ave pointed to-ward
book-type diplomas. Kansas State,
University of South -Carolina, Tulane,
Syracuse, Nebraska, Ohio State, and
Carnegie Tech were among the
schools mentioned by registrar Quick
as using it.

Educational
Trends Cited

V‘oca-tional’ and Avoeational
Guidance Stressed.

Signiﬁcant trends in- modern edu-
cation were discussed in the reports
given by University faculty members
at the luncheon meeting last Thurs-
day of the Personnel Council of the
University,

Dean Thynsa VV. Amos cited the most-
important trend as the new outlook on
vocational guidance, the training of
students for specialized work and at
the same time generalized work in
the same ﬁeld, and the teaching of an
avocation or hobby for leisure time.

After years of experience in inten-
sive specialization it has been ﬁnally
realized that a more general back-
ground must be given to a student to
ﬁt him for any changes that may ob-
solete his job or make the. procuring
of a position in his specialized ﬁeld

out.

That mass education is slowly pass-
ing out of the American program was
vigorously denied by the proponents
of our present system. It was argued
that the old standards of education
are evolving into one where the sys-
tem is adapted to the individual
rather than the individual to the sys-

tem, with an increase in the educa-
tion of the masses being anticipated
rather than a decrease.

The study of the personality ad-
justment of young men and women
and its relation to home training, con-
ducted by Dr. Burgess, of the Univer-
sity of Chicago, was another im-
portant topic
meeting.

YM Cabinet
Election Soon

 

 

Committee Meets to Consid-
er Nominees

 

To consider potential nominees to
the YMCA Presidents’ Cabinet, exec-
utive body of the Y, the newly ap-
pointed nominating committee of two
faculty men and three senior mem-
bers, met for the ﬁrst time yester-
day. No deﬁnite choices are to be
made until later in the semester.

Six of the nine members of the
Cabinet are subject to renomination;
the other three are to graduate. Mem-
bers are elected for terms of one year
at the end of the spring session, but
they can be re-elected to succeed
themselves.

In considering nominees, the nomin-
ating committee must ﬁll in ques-
tionnaires answering the commit-
tee’s judgment of nominees’ qualiﬁca-
tions. Topics considered range from
personality to attitudes.

For example, in answer to the ques-
tion, “What effect does his physical
presence, manner, voice, and dress
have upon you,” the committee must
check one of the following: inspiring,
favorable, indifferent, unfavorable, or
repellent.

Indicating their estimate of the
nominees judgment, intelligent grasp
of his work, and ability to think
through problems, the nominations
must consider the following: deep
and constructive, clear thinker, good
mind, superﬁcial, or easily confused
and dull.

In considering his efficiency, the‘
committee is to limit itself to such
comments as: highly achieving even
under great difficulties-, efficient un-
der normal conditions, li-mited execu-
tive ability, clerical capacity, or care-
less.

Other characteristics include con-
sideration of Christian ideals, value
to the association movement, ability
to cooperate, and degree of stick-to-
it-iveness.

University Seismograph Registers

The University seismograph chart, shown above with
Dr. Homer M. Rutherford, University seismologist and grad-
uate assistant in geology, recorded the violenteearthquake
that caused death and disaster in the vicinity of Los Angeles
last Friday night. The tremors were recorded on the seis-
mograph in a series of vibration marks, caused by the move-
ments of a suspended, steady mast which has an arrange-
ment for magnifying its motions. The California disturb-

ance was a pectonic ’quake, according to Dr. Rutherford,
and was caused by a slipping of the rock crust, due to

strains which were relieved by a breaking of the inner rock.

ELLUSEON:

A large packing case is exhibited on 3' raised plat-
form. A young woman climbs into the box. Head,
hands and feet protrude, and are held by specta-
tors while the magician takes a crosscut saw and,
with the help of an assistant, saws through the
center of the box and apparently through the W0-
man.

EXPLANATION;

There are many explanations for this illusion. One
method of performing this illusion requires the
presence of trwogirls in the box. One girl curls up
in the left half of the box with her head and hands
protruding, giving the effect you see illustrated
above. The other girl is doubled up in the right
half of the box, with only her feet showing. Nobody
is sawed in half. ‘

Californians might escape ’quake disasters, the seismologist
pointed out, by constructing buildings that are more rigid.
Other tremors have been recorded by the University seis-
mograph, reported to be taking place almost hourly. A
strong earth shock yesterday morning, characterized as sec-
ond only to the one recorded Friday, was not recorded by
the University, the instrument being locked at that time.
The Southern California earthquake has been reported as

taking more than 135 lives and causing more than $60,000,-
000 of damage. Cities to suffer most were Long Beach,
Compton, Huntington Park, and Los Angeles.

Dr. W.’t Hooft 
Speaks Here

Famous Theologian Will
Address Faculty Club

Dr. W. A. Visser ’t Hooft, interna-
tionally known theologian, ls to g.pea_]._§..
next Monday afternoon, on “Move-
ments of Thought and Action Among’
Students Today" at a YMCA lecture‘
in the Faculty Club. The address is
to begin at 3:30 o'clock.

A native of Holland, Dr. ’t Hooft is-
spending ﬁve weeks in this country
upon the invitation of American stu-
dent groups. By general agreement
in leading Christian association cir-
cles, he is the person who is most fa-—
miliar with currents of life and
thought, political and religious,-
among modern youth.

In his last years at Leyden Univer-
sity, he was a leader in relief work
for Central and Eastern European
students through the European Stu-
dent Relief Agency. In 1922, on leav-
ing the university, he joined the Boys’
Work staff of the World’s Committee
of the YMCA and since that time has
had a. steadily growing influence in
international affairs.

As Geneva correspondent of “The"
Christian Century” he has followed
closely the work of the League of
Nations and very particularly of re-
cent disarmament conferences.

Dr. ’t Hooft was called to the staff‘
of the World’s Student Christian Fed-
eration as European and American
secretary in 1930, as well as being ap-
pointed to editorship of “The Student
World.” In 1932 he was appointed?
general secretary of the Federation,
in which capacity he is
groups of students and professors the
world over. .

He has written “The Background}
of the Social Gospel in America” and'
is soon to publish another book on‘
“Non-Roman Catholicism.”

“His religion is scholarly, incisive,
personal, and practical.

selves. Quality is by far the most important.
Domestic cigarette tobaccos vary in price
from 5:3 a pound up to 40¢ a pound. Imported

Gaining the top-hole position in the
Eastern Basketball League Saturday
night at Morgantown in defeating the
West Virginia Mountaineers, 45-35,
Dr. Carlson’s Panther passers acquir-
ed possession of the new league’s
ﬁrst trophy. Although the Panthers
have one more game to play—that
with Carnegie Tech Friday evening—
the results will have no effect on the
team standing as the Tartans, who
had a ﬁne chance to tying Pitt for the
league, lost their opportunity Satur-
day evening when Georgetown nosed
out the ambitious Skibos, 43-41.

Ochsenhirt placed Pitt in the lead
at the start with a ﬁeld goal, and
Charley Hughes added a point from
the foul line. W. Hughes scored a
ﬁeld goal. Stydahar gave West Vir-
ginia its ﬁrst two points. Wilson
added a foul. Ochsenhirt came back
with a ﬁeld goal. Stydahar tallied a
free throw. Skippy Hughes scored a
two-pointer, and Sortet splurged with
two ﬁeld goals and a foul, to tie the
count at nine-all.

Stydahar placed the Mountaineers
in the lead with a double-decker. Mc-
Camant retaliated with a ﬁeld goal,
to tie the score at 11 points, and
Hughes got a foul. Charles Hughes
added two more points, but Sortet
scored two points and Stydahar
placed West Virginia ahead witha
ﬁeld goal and a foul. The Moun-
taineers led, 16-14, at the half-time in-
termission.

Slate opened the second period
with a ﬁeld goal, but Smith staged
an individual exhibition, scoring three
ﬁeld goals and a foul in quick order.
Ochsenhirt got two double-deckers in

succession. Slate tallied two points
for West Virginia and Fidler added
two more. McCamant sank a long
one for Pitt. West Virginia rallied.
Sortet, Slate and Fidler scored four
ﬁeld goals to place the Mountaineers
ahead, 30-37. Pitt drew time out.
Ochsenhirt scored a ﬁeld goal, Smith
two and C. Hughes one"to give ‘Pitts-
burgh a deﬁnite lead. Slate and Sty-
dahar-each scored ﬁeld goals.
Leading, 34-33, Pitt went into a
stall. The Panthers disorganized the
West Virginia defense, then struck
swiftly to score four ﬁeld goals and a
foul in less than two minutes. Styda-
har tallied the ﬁnal Mountaineer
counter and Charley Hughes totaled
the Pitt score. -

Point Average

To scout the idea that to be an
athlete is to have a strong pair of
legs, lots of beef, a strong back but
only a small amount of the property
commonly called brains, the athletic
department released yesterday a com-
posite and individual scholastic aver-
age of the various major and minor
teams in operation during the ﬁrst
semester.

The general. quality point average
of all athletes for the ﬁrst semester
was 1.12 which compares to the gen-
eral student average over the entire
campus of 1. The quality point aver-
ages range from 1.52 made by mem-
bers of the riﬂe team to .89 the stand-
ard for varsity footballers.

Swimmers had a 1.35 quality point
average to hold second place, scholas-
tically, among Pitt’s athletes. Track-
sters maintained an average of 1.13;
boxers, 1.12, cross-country men, 1.08,
cagers, 1.01.

William Albright. a member of the
Panther track team and cross-country
man last fall headed the list of the 15
best, scholastically, among individual
team members. VVa.llen Currie, riﬂe,
maintained an average of 2.68. Ken-
neth McFar1and, another member of

the riﬂe team nad an average of 2.47.

Other averages were: Joe
Schmeiler, swimming, 2.50; Irving
Robbins, swimming, 2.50; James Wat-
kins, track, 2.00-; Arveil Fleming,
track, 1.91; and William Ames, basket-
ball, 1.87.

Pitt Places In Two Events
In Conference Games

While Ralph Metcalfe of Marquette
was breaking the world’s record for
the 60-yard dash, Pitt men placed in
two events at the Central Inter-Colle-
giate Conference indoor track meet at
South Bend, Indiana, Friday and Sat-
urday. Metcalfe’s time was 6 1-10 sec-
"3nd‘s. ’

Pitt’s one-mile relay team, consist-
ing of Kiger, Keller, Watkins, and Mc-
Donald, placed second in their event
to Michigan State. The winner's time,
3226.9, was only .3 seconds better than
that of the Olson-coached group.
Coach said yesterday that only awk-
wardness in the baton-handling, which
lost 15 yards for the team, kept the
Blue and Gold from victory.

In the 440-yard dash, Bill Keller

placed fourth, The winner in this
event, Mullins, of Western State
Teachers’ College, took the race in
50.8 seconds. Keller had previously
won his heat Friday evening in 51.2

Dr. Sutherland Plans Coaches’

Sessions During High
School Track Meet

 

 

Third Saturday In May

 

Tomorrow afternoon, after a lapse
of three months the Panther gridders
will have their ﬁrst taste of green
grass and brown earth when they be-
gin unlimbering on the practice ﬁeld
during the ﬁrst spring practice ses-
sions. _ ____ _________

Although the Weather forwtheipast
few days has been anything -but con-
ducive to good clean practices. Dr.
Sutherland is planning to take the
boys out on the ﬁeld ISO that the seri-
ous business of training and adjust-
ing them for the fall season can rap-
idly progress. In view of the fact

that only six weeks have been set
' aside for practice sessions, the doctor

feels that there is a great need to get
the stffness out immediately.

Yesterday afternoon, varsity play-
ers trekked through the doors of the
Stadium locker room to claim uni-
forms unused since the Southern Cal-
ifornia game, and this afternoon
“Skip” Gougler’s- frosh will have uni-
forms issued theml for practices, as
well alsi those who are appearing on
the University grid practice ﬁeld for
the ﬁrst time. ‘

A development of the spring prac-
tice session announced by Dr. Suther-
land last week, will be an invitation
gridiron clinic to which coaches of
high schools and nearby colleges will
be invited. He plans to conduct the

‘clinic during the annual high school

invitation track meet, scheduled tenta-
tively the third week in May. During
the meeet, coaches will have an oppor-
tunity of “going to school” for a day
under the doctor’s tutelage.

Team -formations, plays, and the
correct positions assumed by players
will be taught during the clinic. Dr.
Sutherland expects to have several
groups in -session at the same time,
on will feature guard and tackle posi-
tions, nother will .stress the bckﬁeld
play, and other will study end defen-
sive and offensive.

During the clinic, varsity and frosh
gridders will act as models.

Something For Council

ELIMINATION of ﬁfth hour classes» from block schedules and, if
feasible, from the schedules. of all undergraduates, a schedule
change suggested some time ago by the News, is a project that calls
for immediate action if anything is" to be accomplished in time to
benefit next year’s students. It is natural that Student Council, as
the governing body representing the students in such matters, should
be expected to investigate the possibilities of such a revision.

Two organizations, representing sections of campus opinion, al-
ready have given their enthusiastic support to the suggestion.
Simultaneous with the appearance of the News’ editorial urging the
change, Interfraternity Council went on record of its own accord
proposing the same action. Alpha chapter of Cwens, national hon-
orary activities fraternity for sophomore women, similarly endorsed
the. project in a letter printed on this page on January 27.

Both Interfraternity Council and Cwens recognized the beneﬁts
that would immediately follow the creation of a general lunch hour.
The importance of safeguarding the health of University students by
reserving a “free” period for them each day was at once apparent
to the members of these groups. This point was particularly empha-
sized as it applied to “block schedule” students who may have little
or no time for their mid—day meals and some relaxation.

“The social relations which could be established at this time
with fraternities and clubs” and the opportunity for participation in
extra-curricular activities, important because it brings to each stu-
dent “a sense of responsibility which classroom work cannot give,”
were the other major values which the fraternity men and the sopho-
more women found in the idea.

The time for the preparation of the fall term schedule is draw-
ing dangerously near. The schedule for summer session classes is
being drawn up now, and work will probably begin on next year ’s
ﬁrst semester classes within a week or two. If Council or anyone
else hopes to see this change incorporated into the plans of the
Schedule committee for next year, they should present their recom-
mendations in the very near future.

Because of space limitations on the campus, especially in labora-
tory courses, proponents of the change may be faced by some ob-
stacles. Whether or not these are sufﬁcient to prevent the incorpora-
tion of a “free hour” into the schedule can be determined only by
investigation.

Registrar Quick has expressed his willingness to cooperate with
students in reaching a decision on the practicability of the sugges-

tion. Council, at its meeting tomorrow night, should give immediate
attention to the hoped-for change.

More Cf Relief

WITH the agencies of government turning their attentions to the

vast problems of reorganization of national ﬁnances and emer-
gency relief, the problem of student relief and l1ow to keep education
within the means of most of us during these “trying times” becomes
a matter of immediate concern.

What emergency measures might be taken now at the Univer-
sity, beyond what has already been done, to aid undergraduates in
their ﬁght to remain outside the ranks of the intellectually un-
employed?

None of us is so optimistic as to expect an increase in registra-
tion when classes convene next September. Certainly, the outlook
ﬁt present would indicate a decrease, however slight, in the enroll-
ment recorded for the current year.

Not a great deal more assistance through scholarships or defer-
red payments of tuition can be expected from the University itself.
In an institution such as ours, whose only endowment is its biennial
appropriation from the commonwealth, the limitations of relief be-
come hard and fast. If the University is to remain a going concern,
a sound institution with plans for the future as Well as the present,
its acts of philanthropy must end at agivcn point. That is why
another drop in registration may call for an enforced reduction in
departmental staffs and a cut in salaries for those fortunate enough
to remain.

Here, indeed, is a problem which worthwhile student groups

might tackle. Here is an opportunity for students to test their train-
ing, their ability to cope with issues more vital than any they have
ever before experienced. Lines of thought thrown out now might
bring surprising results. At least, there is the comfort that the
most abject failure could not be compared with the four-year ﬁasco
of our recently dethroned elders.
. Students might examine, for instance, the possibility of institut-
ing a system of barter exchange—an exchange for both services and
commodities-——as one emergency relief measure. Any such plan
would call for the unlimited cooperation of all University dependents.
The solution, perhapvs, does not lie in such a plan. The problems in-
volved 111 1ts'work1ng out would be many. But somewhere along the
way there might be an answer worth seeking.

Now, if ever before, the time is ripe for a little testing of the
values, of education.

HE CRISIS and subsequent panic of the past ten days is about to

hoped for, but which, we might as

well admit, we did not expect so soon. Aside from concrete changes
in our banking and monetary system and changes ‘in our national
policies, there was. in the happenings of the past week as. nice an
exhibition of how democracy works as has been seen on this con-

tinent in two decades.

We have seen a democracy face a.-. tough sit-

uation, and make the very decisions¢—

that the most intelligent and progress-
ive dictator would.

I hope that our American Fascists
and that our local breed of Com-
munists will consider this little object.
lesson. It would be expecting, too
much to hope that the events of last
week and the coming weeks would
convert these two minorities to the
old, mossy, but somehow true tenet,
Vox populi, vox Dei. If what has
happened shuts’ the mouths of these
super-idealist critics (Mr. Jay Frank-
lin, in particular) for a few months,
we may all be thankful for the rest
and quiet.

Democracy’s Machinery.

It is a. pity, of course, that we can-
not institute reforms and changes
when everything is going well, and
thus avoid in part disasters such as
the one we are witnessing now. But
we cannot. Human beings and their
institutions, unfortunately, do not
work that way. To get the Federal
Reserve System, we had to have the
panic of 1907. To get a national bank-
ing system, whose need has been ap-
parent to everyone since the War, we
had to have the panic of 1933. Natur-
ally that is an understatement of all
that we may expect as a result of

— these lean years. We are going to get

a better banking system plus a lot of
other things that we need. And we
are going to miss getting a lot of other
things that we really need. At least,
however, we are not standing still.

Outward appearances would make it
seem that Mr. Roosevelt's proposed
revolution in banking will be insti-
As anyone
with only one good eye can see, he
has Congress in the palm of his hand.
To the public mind right now, any
Senator or Representative who op-
poses him is a. traitor. There are
few, if any, in either house who would
dare do that now. Certain, it is, that
his actions and words since Saturday
before last have been unwelcomely re-
ceived among the reactionaries and
conservatives. But so great has been
his public support that no one cared
to risk saying what was being
thought.

Banking Reforms

From a considerable number of the
nation’s bankers opposition to the pro-
posed reforms of Roosevelt and
Woodin may be expected, The
present dual banking laws, which
give a banker his choice between state
or federal control, have been of ad-
vantage to the banker. But that sys-
tem has been the source of many
evils, among them, the lack of a sin-
gle policy and an unfortunate competi-
tion between federal aud state gov-

ernments to secure “customers,”
which brought a laxity of require-
ments.

It is generally agreed now that
Roosevelt proposes to abolish all state
banks, or at least compel all banks to
become members of the lrederal Re-
serve System. That is a sweeping
change, a change that could not have
been bought for love nor money a
year ago. But through circumstances
Roosevelt has been put in a position
to do very nearly what he pleases
with the banks, allowing for a mim-
mum of opposition.

The enthusiasm of Congress for
whatever the President proposes has
only begun to cool. And while the leg-
islators are still asleep on their feet.
he may get them to pass the very bill
that is needed. Besides, Federal Re-
serve membership is an advantage
more apparent now than ever, with
the Reserve banks hxtending badly
needed credit. There remains the
possibility of an organized opposition.
But I doubt its potency. For public
opinion and law-makers alike are
grabbing at straws now. And it is ap-
parent that Mr. Roosevelt has taken
the ofﬁce of chief straw-thrower.

Weak Opposition

It is apparent that all this means
the end of the old time banker. The
small bank which served its own com-
munity well, as the presidents of
these institutions used to say at the
cbnventions of the American Banker's
Association, was usually a. state-
licensed institution. The unfortunate
part of the scheme was that it served
its community with good intentions,
but too often with disastrous results.
The weakness of the small, state-
licensed bank has received its full
share of publicity in the lists of
failures.

On whether Roosevelt and Woodin
intend to allow or encourage chain
and branch banking, we know little as
yet. But it is no idle guess that,
if they are serious in their concern
over security for the depositor, and
see what is inevitable, existing re-
strictions on chain banking will be
partially removed, with a view to a
future policy of allowing branches.

There is a more deﬁnite suggestion

of a. sharp diﬁerentiation among
types of banking by which the law
will provide that each institution will
engage in one of the four and no
more. Under this plan there would be
(1) commercial banks, (2)
banks, (3) trust companies, (4) invest-
ment banks.

The evils inherent in a system that
allows a genuine bank to own an
affiliate whose business. is the market-
ing of stocks and bonds are no secret.
The famous Peruvian b.onds, the more
recent Senate investigation of the Na.-
tional City Bank and’ its afﬁliate——
these things have given ample testi-
mony of the necessity for a. separation
of banking and stock and bond pro-
moting activities. Trust functions
have for the most part already been
made separate from banking func-
tions. Trust departments are, al-
-though owned by savings banks, run
under different laws, and operated by
separate" officials.

The proposal to separate commer-
cial and savings banks, and to forbid
the one to carry on the functions of
the other is hardly one to be adopted
whole-heartedly. It has been amply
demonstrated in the failures and suc-
cesses of the past years. that the worst
fault of a small-town bank was its
lack of diversiﬁcation. The metro-
politan institutions that show great
strength today are those whose busi-
ness is greatly diversiﬁed. Such a
sharp differentiation between savings
and commercial banks would probably
put a burden on the former, taking
away their opportunities to deal in
the more ready assets.

Other Things

VVhi1e the administration's bank
holiday has been received well, it be-
came evident on Saturday with the
opposition of a strong Democratic
bloc to the proposed cuts in veteran’s
relief that all is not to be smooth sail-
ing for the next four years. It is
well known, of course, that when it
comes to being a little tight with the
electorate back home-, a legislator can
be very touchy. This may mark the
ﬁrst break between a Congress that
would like a status quo budget and a
President who would like to carry out
his campaign promises,

But Roosevelt lost very little by
that Saturday interlude. He still has
his panic prestige. Anxious as Demo-
cratic Senators and Representatives
are to be well thought of among the
electorate, they are equally anxious to
wipe out a bad record, acquired in
their inability to ﬁnd a leader and fol-
low him. In the coming months their
leader is going to take them to many
strange watering-troughs. And he is
going to offer them a lot that they
cannot or do not care to swallow.

He is going to show them power
projects, which will be a, violation of
American individualism; he is going
to show them higher income and in-
heritance taxes; he is going to show
them unemployment insurance, unless
he is keeping some secret formula for
relief that no one else in the world
has ever thought of before; and he is
going to show them war debt reduc-
tion, that will burn like an acid. The
main question is, how long will Con-
gress remain docile? I hope the
answer is, until Roosevelt begins to
think about 1936. ‘

A MAYOR IS A
FEMALE HORSE

ND you haven't heard the half

of it! The other day Bill Boner

said the Sphinx were a tribe of peo-
ple living in Egypt!

Won’t some kind friend tell him
what to do before it's too late? What
he needs is a good pipe and good to-
bacco. Of course, the right tobacco is
necessary—~but that’s easy. A recent
investigation showed Edgeworth to
be the favorite smoking tobacco at
42 out of 54 leading colleges.

And here’s why: Edgeworth isn't
just another smoking tobacco. It’s
an individual blend of ﬁne old bur-
leys. And you'll know that difference
with the ﬁrst cool puff of Edgeworth.
