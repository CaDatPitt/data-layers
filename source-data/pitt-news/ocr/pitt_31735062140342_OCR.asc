New Course: The Church 8: The War

By BETTY McMAHAN

“The church, concerned about its future course '
luring this crisis, is examining itself to discover its
ahortcomings,’,' Dr. Samuel Franklin, professor of
education, said today, in an interview concerning his
new course, “The Present War and the Religious

Outlook in America.”

The course is one of a group started this school
year and related to the national emergency.
Twenty-six pastors, religious workers, teachers,
and undergraduates of all faiths are enrolled. They
will attempt to find church shortcomings by examin-
ing the place of the church in the last World War
and what now seems to have been its mistakes.
These problems are studied by small groups which
meet to gather literature on a speciﬁc problem and

then /present ﬁndings to the class.
, Some of these problems are:

STUDENTS BUYING oarensé STAMPS

Pitt News Photo

Battleship Drive Opens;
Exceeds ' 'All Expectations’

Beginning with a big splash,
the battleship committee sales to-
taled $83.25 Wednesday, opening
day of the Defense Stamp drive.

Stamps will be sold again next
Wednesday.

The initial sale of 333 twenty-
ﬁve cent stamps boosted the drive
beyond “all expectations,” said
salermanager Edwin Klein, BA42.

_ “There is, however, no reason why
every single student shouldn’t have
bought at least one stamp, when
you consider what a ﬁne ‘invest-

ment this represents.” .

Wednesday's receipts were the
first contributions, although the
committee has been working for a
month on publicity. All funds ob-
tained will be turned over to the
government.

A battleship may never’ really
receive any of the money derived
from the sale of these stamps, but
it is being used merely as an ex-
ample 0: one, of the government’s
vital lnoney- consuming defense
projects. _

“The object of the drive," said
Herbert Gall, M43, chairman, f‘is
to reach the students who other-
wise would never lend the govern-
ment any ﬁnancial support."

In reviewing the first day’s ef-
forts, Klein criticized -the “ﬂimsy
excuses some students’ presented
instead of buying a stamp.” He said
the most common reply was, “Next
week!”

Other salesmen noted indifference
and even opposition on the part of
a small number of students.

Similar drives ‘for raising de-
fense funds have been successful

the war?

By studying these problems, Dr. Franklin
the class discovered that the church and the state
were attempting to solve some of the same economic
and political problems.

“Surely,” said Call, “the tran-
sition from high school to college
should not destroy a person’: pa-
triotism or his desire to be of some
service to his country. . . . If they
can do it, so can we . . -. and bet-

The also discovered that the proposals for the so-

instance, the Atlantic charter drawn up last August
by Winston Churchill, and President Roosevelt is
alike in many waysfto church proposals for a new

7‘/arsity Rillers Gain Clean

Sweep Over College Foes

 

By PAUL PALANZO .

Reports of the postal matches
ﬁred last week.-end between the
Panther varsity marksmen and va-
rious ‘colleges came via the mail
yesterday, and it was the best
sports news that the University

has received in a long time. -

/

Five colleges in all-.--Kansas,
_ South Dakota State, Dayton,‘Geor-.
gia. Tech, and Davidson.--failed to
match the Blue and Gold score of
1388 points, thereby giving the
local boys ﬁve precious victories.
These recent successes’ swelled
the total for the season at ten wins
as against ﬁve defeats.
Previously unrecorded victories
are included in this record——a pos-
tal match with Drexel Institute

‘and a shoulder-to-shoulder meet

with the strong Neville lsland club
of Pittsburgh. .
Leading last week’s victorious
bullet barrage was Captain Larry
La Spada, who posted a ﬁne 282

mark, _ followed closely by Bruno ,
Cengiitgand John-uy_.__l-_lelbling, both 
of wli;:o'_in,’ hit equially ﬁne -.2‘-%O"s. ,

These"f"'three lads 1? have been the

most consistent shooters on the V
squad, and they have been respon- '=

sible for the sudden rise of the
team after’ it had fared poorly at
the beginning of the :season last
month. 7 = S
i\'1'ca‘n\vhile, the ROTC squad did
not manage to repel their toes and
were handed three more’ setbacks.
Georgia Tech, Cornell. and the Uni-
versity of Maine were the victors
over our cadets, thus making the
ROTC record read three wins and
six losses. The three victorieswere
over ‘Ohio State University, Wis-
cousin, and Pennsylvania, the latter
two being oﬁicially recorded recent-

ly. Johnny I-Ielbling, who also did
well for the varsity, was the out-
standing" performer :Fo.r the ROTC.
Both the ROTC and the varsity
will again see action this week-end
when eachwill ﬁre against ﬁve op-
ponents. Furnishing the opposition
for the cadets will be Virginia
Military Institute, Iowa State uni-
versity, Tennessee, Kentucky, and
lllinois.‘

The va.rsity riﬂcrs will attempt
to extend their winning streak, now
at six. straight and nine out of the
last eleven, at the expense of Cor-
nell, Michigan State, Virginia Mili-
tary Institute, Washington univer-
sity, and the po\vert‘ul. Marine Bar-
racks aggregation.

Daily drills are in high gear at
the Stadium r-a.n,g'e, for this is, no
doubt, the toughest task confront-
in<,>,' the entire Blue and Gold maiks-
men squad.

: Died;  _UniveI_-ysity of

Pittsburgh basketball.team last ’

, Tuesday_ . ‘evening-..‘ at 99:30
o'clock at the :Carnegie Tech
gymnasium in its 12th game
of a prolonged illness. The
Panther squad was born on

d December 20, 1941, at Evans-
ton, lllinois.

The health of the deceased
was steadily declining until
this week when the “Tartan
Tjerrors," conquerors of Thiel,
Allegheny, and .Case, proved
justtoo much for them.

}The victim was survived by
its father, Doctor H. Clifford

Panther, Cagers
Hope To Avenge
Nittany Deleat

Pitt's l)attle—scarred and weary

basketball Panthers move down to

State College tomoirmv night . in
an attelnpt to avenge. an early sea-

son defeat sutl’ered at the han.ds= of .

the Penn State cagers on the Sta-
dium ﬂoor. However, if the show-
ing; they made’ against Carnegie
Tech last Tuesday night is any cri-
terion olf the type of vengeance they
plan to inﬂict on the,Lions they
may as well stay home.

In facing a vastly inferior Tar-
tan team the Blue and Gold dis-
played the vsloppiest brand of bas-
ketball a Pitt team has shown in
many seasons. After the first half
the Panthers were never in the
contest and by the time the ﬁnal
whistle blew they were merely go-
ing through the motions.

Led by Herky Baltimore, Elmer
Gross and the blocking zone de-
fense the State basketeers over-

came a 20-9 lead held by Pitt at
the hall.’ to emerge the victors,

34-30.'In the first half blond Bomb- ~

er Larry Paffrath scored 16 of
the Panthers’ 20 points, but was
completely bottled up in the sec-
ond part of the game.

While Pitt was cooling off, El-
mer Cross was getting hot and
with Baltimore, combined’ to‘ sink
the Carlson-coached’ ﬁve. The

blocking zone defense also played.

a big part in the Panther defeat.

Tomorrow ni_9;ht Carlson prom-
ises to spring some sort oil.’ sur-
prise on State to counteract the
defense use by that team. He re-
fused to elaborate on the tactics
his oﬁense will employ, but stated
that the zone defense would be in-
effective against it.

What ever it is it must be better
than the type oil.’ gaiiie Pitt played
against Tech, or Penn State will
be a little closer to the NCAA play-
offs. T

start of the. day’s events when Trager nosed out P'itt’s Cui§tis., «
until the famed mile-relay team lost to the B

last race. 1
Ohio State’s Bob Wright

the day when he won the 60-yard high hurdles in record l)1‘e.z1l<.-* ”

' .,§_«.-..s_.

ing time, tied with Stickel in the
70-yard low hurdles, and ﬁnished.
third in the sh-otput and 60-yard
dash.
ln his record-shattering 60-yard
high hurdle dash, Wright ﬁnished
in 8.7 seconds, bettering the old
record of 9 seconds. George Hoef-
linger of Ohio cleared the ‘high
jump bar at six feet three and one-
half inches, bettering the original
mark by one and a half inches.
Thoseiwere the only two n1at‘l(s
that were threatened.

The highlight of." the meet oc-
curred in the last race of’ the day
when Pitt already saw their chanc-
es of victory gone. The Blue and
Gold quartet comprised of Stickel.
Peretic, Smith, and Carter entered
the race "against theABuckeyes with
the Millrose and the Boston AA
titles already tucked under their
belts. '

“Hap” Stickel took the lead at

the outset and handed the baton
to Al Peretic while four yards in
front of his rival. The inexperienc-
ed junior had trouble receiving
the baton and as a result lost
not only the lead but several yards.
Smith took up the race, but kept
the same distance with the Ohio
State man. When the stick was ﬁn-
ally passed to anchor man Carter,
the Buckeye star, Owen, was ﬁve
yards in the lead. “Bullet Bill" ran
the lastquarter in 50.1, and miss-
ed catching his rival by a. scant
yard.

Pitt was literally outclassed in
the‘ ﬁeld events when the Ohio men
swept the shot put, high jump,
broad jump, and the pole vault. The
Buckeyes ran up their points in
these events to give the Panthers
one of the worst beatings in the
history of indoor track at the Uni-
vorsity.

Coach Olson leaves tomorrow at‘-
ternoon for the New York Athletic
Association meet with pole vaulter
“Dusty” Rhoades, and the mile-re-
lay squad of‘ Carter, Stickel, Smith,
and Peretic. The Panthers are rat-
ed to be the darkhorse outﬁt of
the New York games with George-
town installed the Tavorites. If the
Cathedralmen triumph over the
Hoyas in the mile-relay race, they
will be regarded as the lilastori.
