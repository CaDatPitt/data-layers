Cost of Building Raises Goal
Of Med Center Campaign

By LEN BAKER
Pitt‘ News Reporter
The Fund Raising Committee for Pitt’s new medical
center has to set its sights on a higher ﬁgure than the $9,-
675,000 estimated last September.
Just how high the ﬁgure will be is the mystery ques-

tion. But it’s getting higher

The cost of building materials
has risen 28 per cent in the last
six months, according to a survey
by the Dow Service. The con-
tracts for the new medical school
and the clinical laboratories and
wards wing could not be distribut-
ed before the rise began because
of continued changes in the medi-
cal school plans.

May Cost $10 Million

The new school and wing, plan-

ned last September at a cost of

$5,500,000, will rise to a specuj,

lated seven to ten million dollars.

The changes in plans resulted
from the School of Nursing being
included in the same building as
the new medical school. The in-
clusion was necessary because of
a $850,000 grant by the Pennsylva-
nia State Authority for Nurses’

every day..

Homes made to Pitt’s new home,
now being built.
Committee Allots Space

A committee has been "meeting
for some time under Dr. Daven-
port Hooker. head of the depart-
ment of anatomy, to decide how
much space should be given to
each department. Until this com-
mittee comes to a decision, even
an approximate overall cost ﬁgure
can not be arrived at.

J. Lloyd Mahony, who recently
came to Pitt to head the fund
raising campaign, said that he can
only make plans which could start
to roll when he is given an esti-
mate.

‘Top Drawer‘ Campaign

“The campaign,” said Mahony,

“will be a top drawer one, rath-

A maximum of about 200 corpora-

Mahony pointed out that these
corporations can be shown the be-

industry. The problem will be
approached from the angle of the
medical school situation in the
entire state, he added.

Pitt’s medical school, which

Policy chgfiigk Allows

June, Xmas Dances

By JdHN KULAMER ‘
Pitt News Writer
They made it! Student Congress ﬁnally got the green
light on its Commons Room dance proposal.

At a meeting on Monday, the, board of undergraduate
deans approved the University social committee’s recom-

The decision of the board to
allow Commons Room danc-
ing represented a major vic-
tory for Student Congress in
its dealings with the admin-
istration. ’

It was the first time within
memory that the lawmakers
had been able to effect an im-
portant U 11 iv e r s i t y policy
change.

Climaxs Long Fight

The objective was reached, how-
ever, only after months of patient
perseverance by SC Vice-President
Bill McKinley against opposition
which at times looked strong
enough to kill the project.

Dean of Men T. W. Biddle and
Dean of Women Helen P. Rush
had objected to the plan from the

ﬁrst. Dean Biddle maintained that

a CR dance “would militate
against the Student Union.” Dean
Rush held that the technical
problems involved in holding such
an affair made it “impractical.”
McKinley investigated these ob-
jections and presented his ﬁndings

— in the form of a petition to the

University social committee. The
petition stated that, since the

funds for the Student Union had

already been guaranteed, the
project would not be endangered
by CR dancing.

Feasibility Asserted

The petition also said that the
cost of administering such an af-
fair would be‘much less than the
price of (for example) the Schen-
ley Hotel ballroom, and there-
fore, was “definitely feasible.”

Finally, the petition said
that “when facilities are not
available, we do not mind
substitutes, but when— [they]

—are available and yet not

employed—we feel that the

University is not doing justice

either to itself or to its stu-

dents.”

The committee approved the
petition and drafted the recom-
mendation which this
brought the _incident to its suc-
cessful conclusion.

Repercussions Already Felt

Thevrepercussions of this move,
which will undoubtedly be na-
tionwide, are beginning to be felt
on a local scale. Student govern-

out “the shackles of the adminis-

It is expected that this move
will result in lower costs for
the student, according to a
University professor who ask-
ed that his name be withheld.
Instead of paying so much
per credit, the student will
contribute a nominal amount,
possibly a quarter or even
less, to the instructor each
time the class meets.

Instead ‘of paying 36 dollars for
a three-credit course meeting
three _times a week, the student
will, during the entire semester,

pay only 12 dollars, or 75 cents a
week. There would be some ar-
rangement made for classes that
met only twice a week for an hour
and a half. The students in these
classes would probably contribute
40 cents per session.

Faculty To Proﬁt

The Faculty Association expects
that the lower costs will attract
more students. “In the long run,”
an Association spokesman said,
“we will gain more remuneration
than under the old system.”

“The largt inﬂux of stu-
dents expected under the new
system,” commented Student_
Congress President Green-
berger, “will, of course, mean
a greater job for Congress. I
believe, however, that Con-
gress ls equal to it.”

When queried by the News on

_ the rumored Flagstaff Hill Dance,

Greenberger replied with a terse
“no comment.”

University oiﬁcials have made
no statement about the turnabout
move. Informed sources say, how-

‘ ever, that the administration will

ﬁght back with a plan of their
own. This plan would involve out-
standing students in each ﬁeld

Well-informed sources express-

Now, many insiders disclose,
new evidence indicates these
groups are really “front” organ-
izations. It should be kept _in mind,
however, that no unfair accusa-
tions should be made or implica-
tions drawn until all the facts are
known.

Meanwhile, upon advice of coun-
sel, Panther editor Horowitz, elab-
orated on his previous statements.
Said Horowitz, “I ain’t answering
no questions because it might tend
to incinerate me.”

Joe MacCarthy, chief exponent of
fair play and violent foe of Un-
Americanism, declared on the floor
of the Senate thatthe Panther ed-

itors should “go back to where .

they came from.” WCTU leaders
and the DAR,
Tribune, however, appear re-
luctant to take them back ‘into
the fold.

Un-American members of the
Committee presented their side of
the dispute by emphatically stat-
ing they would show a clear case
of subversive activity. In answer
to this Horowitz clariﬁed his pre-
vious statement. Said the Pan-
ther editor, “I ain’t talking.”

appeal to the all-important farm

even more concrete evidence of his

ysteria   Nat Hysteria
We had to use some editorial dynamite a few weeks ago
jto discover that the University does have some good, sound
fplans on how to attract students, which was the main
‘con_cern of the editorial, “Hysteria in High Places.”
So we aren’t mad about that subjectany more. V
we are mad, however, that we had to use dynamite to
ast out the information that such plans exist. The pro-
ram_ (and it’s a good one) had been on the books for a
month when we blasted the powers that be .for not having
lny such plan. They were only too’ happy, 'of course, to
*point out error after the editorial appeared.
i It’s been that way as long as we can remember, and no
f‘matter_ how we beg, cajole, and complain, we still have to
use editorial dynamite, which is awfully -hard on the,ﬁx-
ftures, to get much of the information that students and
wfaculty have a right to know. -
We have been entrusted with many bits of information
which were obviously not for publication, but as a general
, ule we must go_clear up to the Chancellor to get stories
which, like the recruiting program, are matters of general
"interest and need no special handling.
A ‘The repercussions» of the ‘hysteria’ editorial have been
-a lesson to us. We hope that_it will be a lesson to our
news sources as well.

o
Wlmt Pme loyalty? .

This editorial is primarily directed to the faculty, but
we hope that students, too, will read it and do something
about it.

_ For some time, ever since the Regents at the University
of ‘California inflicted their now-infamous ‘loyalty oath’ on
the faculty at that school and succeeded in driving some
‘ of the top professors away as a result, we’ve been concerned
about the way similar movements have sprungiup in various
state legislatures.

VVe never dreamed, however, that this misguided idea,
one that threatens the very basic tenets of academic freedom,

. would gain any headway. “It can’t happen here,” we said.
’ ac =1: :5: .

4

Well, "it’s happening. . I

, The State Senate Wednesday passed just such a meas-
'.ure, one that would require faculty members here to swear
’ {that they held no beliefs that might possibly-»be construed
: as sympathetic to Communist principles on pain, of dismissal
from their jobs. ;

__ No‘ clearer example of state,thought—control has ever
been foisted on the people of this state or this country than
 this bill. If\it becomes law, we will have taken a long step
toward that brand of totalitarianism that we fought in the
last war and are currently ﬁghting in Korea and the UN.

:1: 3: :1<

The editor of this newspaper expects to be drafted June
'9, as do hundreds of students here and elsewhere in Penn-
‘ sylvania. ,

, If we are going to ﬁght the Communist brand of authori-
 tarian government, then we expect to ﬁght the same kind of
government at home. And ﬁght it we will.

.\ We wish to go on record as being iunalterably opposed
to this measure. We hope that a large percentage of the
. students and faculty will do so as well. THIS BILL MUST
_ NOT BECOME LAW! .

Panther—Pro and Con

 

By |sabe|- Lubovskiyli

The question for this week’s Pitt
Poll, “What do you think of this
year’s Panther?” has brought var-
ied replies. «
Donald Samuels, Col. ’52: “On the
whole it’s pretty good, but I’d like
to see more cartoons init.”
Frances Hohl, Col. ’53: “It’s been
okay, but I didn’t care for this last
issue.” ' V
James Dunbar, Col. ’51: “It’s a
very good publication, humorous
and clever.”

Myron S .Kopelman, graduate: “I
decline to answer on the grounds
of self-incrimination.” ,
Abe Zaidan, Col. ’53: “I will say
it’s exclusive. My friends in other
universities don’t know how they

get away with it.”

Emily Eshelman, Col. ’5l: “I think
it’s a good college humor maga-
zine.”

Robert Boyles, Ed. ’52: “I think
the literature could be "improved,
however the humor is rather
’good3’

Dee Bailie, Col. ’53: “It’s a big let-
down from-last year’s Panther.”
Serge Daniels, Col. ’54: “It’s all
right now, but I hope they don’t
overstep the bounds of decent lit-
erature.” ‘ S
Harold Campbell, Col. ’5l: “—I am
always amused with the humor in
the Panther, especially with the
parodies on current magazines.”
Richard Wilson, Col. ’53: “I-don’t

reading it.”

ED JENSEN‘

As you must have gathered from reading PaPge 2 of
today’s paper, this is the Pitt News April Fool’s edition. (Any.
similarity to the Panther’s Sexquire is purely coincidental.)

At the risk of being regarded a‘ wet blanket by my
fellow staffers, all of whom pitched in with enthusiasm to
make this issue a howling success,.I wish here to go on

record as irreconcilibly opposed to the observance of this
0

barbarous relic of yesteryear.

Why Continue Practice?

The grounds for setting aside a
special day‘for the fools in the
populace no longer exists. We
have progressed so far beyond our
medieval ancestors that we are
now capable of being fools every
day in the week and twice on
Sunday. Any fool can see that.

’W_itness radio and television‘.

In this ﬁeld of entertainment
the greater the fool the higher
his pay. There is actually a
premium on being what the an-
cients were but once a year.

But to delve a little deper into
the subject; the foolishness that

is peculiar to the ﬁrst day in April
is mainly of the practical joke
variety. In this ﬁeld the“punster
whose humor is tempered with a
wee bit of sadism is supreme.

Whimsey Perverted

His whimsey ﬁnds a true out-
let in such devilish pranks as in-
serting a small charge of TNT in
the wiring system of your auto,
or sending you a telegram ,ad—
vising you that your sweetheart
has hit the road with another man,
or a special delivery letter warn-
ing you that your prospective
pappy-in-law is gunning for your

hide (I might point out that a

prank of this Sort only resultsinxihi

your easing up on your vigilance-+

something that can have grave ‘'

consequences.)

reprehensible.

Concerning a Snap Course

Believe it or‘ not, the physics department is worried
because not enough people are taking their snap course-

non-technical physics 1 and 2.

Physics prof Oswald Blackwood
was exasperated recently when,
as a witness, he had to give a
short (free) course in physics to
an otherwise well-educated judge,
who was trying a patent case. This
illustrates very pointedly, he says,
the fact that people who‘ will be
leaders in this technological age
are the very people who avoid
even snap courses in physics in
college high school.

No math background is neces-
sary for physics 1 and 2, and tests
are mostly on principles, not prob-
lems—the natural laws behind
heat, light, simple atomic physics,
etc. Put that in your memory

I can vouch for the course.
It is a pretty interesting,
three-credit soft touch as a
ﬁeld C science, but one‘ note
of warning: If you takeit in
the evening, either wait and _
eat dinner afterwards or plan
on bringing a pillow to class.
Heavy meal and warm room
make dozing unavoidable, and
those hard chairs in G-8 al-
ways give you a. cramped
back.

Hero With Coffee-Pot

An intrepid guy from’ the bur-
Sar’s office who is still anonymous
wasa hero just before Easter va-
cation. Thursday morning, March
15, a group» of .- girls, including
Mavis Fuhr and; Joanne Gordon of
the University editor’s oﬁice, push-
ed open the door, of the 24th ﬂoor
women's washrbom and were
greeted by billowing .clouds of
smoke. . .

, Their cries brought our uniden-
titled hero, who dashed in with
his trusty coffee-pot and put out
the ﬁre. According to 24th ﬂoor
authorities someone’s cigarette
butt had caused the blaze in a

stuffed wastebzisket.

0

my guess is that the people in
the bursar‘s otﬁce are still faith-
ful disciples of one Bill Scrivo,
1949-50 Pitt News News editor,
who devoted a great deal of en-
ergy to pointing out the ‘defects
in Tuck Shop coffee. He wrote a
death-bet‘. apology to Miss Ruth
Cramblett for his slighting re-
marks about her blend of Java.

Watch White-Coated Men!

' Be slow to call men in white
coats, for obviously insane char-
acters are roaming our ‘halls at
this time of the year. Stopped a
guy running up the steps with a‘
hockey stick not long ago. He
gasped, “Demonstration, speech!-
I’m late!” and rushed on.

Reminded me of the time last
year when a man walked into the
eighth ﬂoor men’s room and start-
ed to blow the insides of a raw
egg out through a pinhole. And
he had to use my sink!

While I washed the goo off my
hands, he, too, grunted “Demon-
stration speech!” and then charged
out and down the stairs, with his
hollow egg nestling in one hand.

Lit, Chorines and Mums '

I wouldn’t say myself that the
tests in Backgrounds of English
Literature are tough, but one guy
told me his, buddy dropped his
pencil and missed four questions.
Another guy in the same class said
his ﬁnger tip turned blue from
the cold zbreeze he stirred ‘up
pushing his tightly-gripped pencil
across the page.

The University Print Shop al-
most had people rushing to Schen-
ley Park to see chorus girls danc-
ing through the hushed green-
houses of staid old Phipps Con-
servatory.

The University’s Photo Library
asked them to set up some ma-
terial for a big display they were
preparing for a downtown bank.

Deans Propose A I

2 Year Phys Ed‘

A proposal to make two_yeazt_&
of physical education compulsory
for all students has been submits
ted by the Board of Deans to the.
faculties of the Un,iversity?§_;-B
schools. , I "V , ,

“The proposal will be cpnsidered
by faculty committees, and the.
ﬁnal decision on the proposal -will-,

be made by the faculties,—since,

they are the people who set the
graduation requirements for their
School,” Stanton C. Crawford,
dean of the College, said yester-
day. -

Captain Tom Hamilton, athletic/'.,

director, is one of the strongest’
backers of the proposal. As far
back as the beginning of the
school year he advocated four
years of physical education for an

Announcement Comes

A r°n ri s '
s Sp 1 g D 1] Begin
By DON MURDOCK '

With spring football drills only four days old, Coach
'Len Casanova was greeted by the news today that he will
be able to use freshmen next fall. I

The Athletic Commitee voted to follow Western Con-‘

ference policy in making freshman athletes eligible to com»
pete in varsity sports. This ruling will be effective beginning

marked the ﬁrst day of a six-week
spring training grind for the Pan-
ther football squad.

Riddled Line

Pitt’s line has been riddled by
graduation losses and service call,
Ends Ted Geremsky and Nick De-
Rosa, tackles Nick Bolkovac and
Flint Green, guards Mike Boldin,
Don Karanovich, Charley Thomas,
and Larry Pierce, and center
George Radosevich are among the
missing.

Fred Botti, Billy Sichko, and
Tony Simile are the only losses
in the backfield. |

“Every position is wide open,”
say Casanova. “My IDEAL type of
ballplayer is the one who shows
Industry, Desire, Enthusiasm, At-
titude, and Loyalty to himself and
his coaches.”

Guards Weak
The undefeated frosh team is
being countec‘. on heavily to help
ﬁll the gaps up front. But at the
guard position graduation has hurt
the Panthers so much that Casa-

of transferring tackle Charley
Yost and fullback Joe Schmidt to
this position.

As things now stand, two trans-
fer students from Duquesne, Dick
Pardini and Blair Kramer, are in-
eligible to play next fall. They

will be changed,

Under the present ruling’ a
transfer student must wait a full
year before hr: is eligible to com-
pete in athletics, but a ruling is
expected to be issued shortly re-
garding transfer students from a
school dropping the sport.

The comparison that appeared here indicating

that Pitt

had albetter basketball team than Duquesne seems to have
created -somewhat of a controversy.

And the inevitable argument-.
who would win if the two teams,

met‘?-has been brought up_

That’s a question that won‘t be 

settled this season, but here‘s hop-
ing that Pitt and Duquesne get to-

gether for a. series next season.3
A natural rivalry like this Should 3
not have been allowed to die in‘;

the ﬁrst place.
No Betting. Though

You can bet that the Gardens or
Pitt’s new ﬁeld house would be
jammed for a game between the
two city rivals. ~

On second thought, maybe you‘d
better not bet-—what with the
Kefauver crime hearings and such
these days. But you can be pret-
ty certain that a Pitt-Duquesne
game would be a first-class attrac-
tion.

It’s hard to understand, then,
why the two teams do not play.
The schools profess friendly rela-
tions——yet do not engage in in-
tercollegiate contests.

Turn About

Doc Carls0n’s cagers do get to-
gether with Dudey Moore's Dukes
‘for pre-season practice games, but
that’s as far as things have pro-
gressed.

It might be interesting to point
out that the Panthers gave the
Dukes a good shellacking in a
game here at the Stadium, but
were in turn shellacked when the
practice site was switched to the
Bluff.

Pitt and Duquesne do, however,
compete in one intercollegiate
sport—riﬂe shooting. Which
brings up a rather amazing point.

Duquesne’s riﬂemen won the
Hearst national ROTC rifle cham-
pionship this year, ﬁring a bet-

Playhouse Show

By DICK SNYDER.

While “The Velvet Glove,” (which previewed last eve-
ning at the Pittsburgh Playhouse) struck me as being, in
the main, a remarkably engaging play, a great deal of the
credit must go to the generally excellent pacing of director

Frederick Burleigh.

Mr. .Burleigh’s success secret isO~~ .

pace and, given a comedy that
tends to wear slightly in the mid-
dle and lag a bit in the laughs de-
partment, as does The Velvet
Glove, he has invested it with
warmth and movement and re-
turned a sparkling dividend.
Convent Locale

The action of the play takes
place in a convent in northern
New York and is concerned with
the imminent dismissal of a young

history professor who stands ac-
cused of some radical views. The
bishop favors the young man's im-
mediate removal and is opposed
by‘ the Mother Superior. who
spends three ' acts solving the
young professor’s problem. ,
Pretty thin stuff, I agree, until
you reckon with the cleft and airy
hand of Mr. Burleigh, andlan ex-
traordinary fresh and disarming

~performance from Miss Dorothy

Well-Paced

Scott as Mother Hildebrand. It is
Miss Scott’s show from start to
ﬁn:ish. She moves through her role
with much skill and grace, con-
verting it into a personal vehicle.
Able Cast Helps

Too, the contributions of John
Johns, Ruth Nirella, William Ross,
Miriam Lewis, and Eileen Larson
are all on a high level, particularly
Mr. Johns and Miss Nirella, who
frequently manage to make The
Velvet Glove sound a great deal
funnier than it actually is.

The Playhouse can get ready to
do business again. Mr. Burleigh
has come up with a warm and
winning evening in the local the-
ater.
