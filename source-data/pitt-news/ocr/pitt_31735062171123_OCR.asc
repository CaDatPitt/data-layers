“A notion of submissive people"

  Kunstler Urges Skepticism

By DAVE MAJERNIK

William Kunstler, civil liber-
ties attorney and spokesman for
minority interests, addressed a
crowd of several hundred people
at Lawrence Hall Friday.

Kunstler said he is currently

defending five young black mili-,

tants, who are charged with mul-

tiple murders in St. Croix, Virgin —

Islands. The FBI, he said, has in-
flicted unbelievable tortures on
these youths to extricate confes-
sions.

The attorney said he will also
be defending American Indian
Movement (AIM) leader Russell
Means when the Wounded Knee
trial begins.

Kunstler then addressed his re-
marks to the Watergate scandal.

“We are living in miraculous
times,” said Kunstler. “I never
thought I’d live to see myself be-
come respectable. All my old ene-
mies are going to jail.”

Kunstler called Ni:«.on Admin-

istration leaders "moral perverts."
‘and said they are in the same

league as the leaders of
Third Reich.

"To these leaders morality has
no meaning. They do not hesi-
tate to violate the Bill of Rights.
Watergate has revealed that
there is no level to which they
will not stoop,” he said.

Kunstler pointed out that sev-

the

‘ eral years ago these same men had

accused him and his friends of
disrupting justice.

Watergate, he said. has reveal-
ed the dangerous tendency of
Americans to believe in their in-
stitutions and their leaders. The
attorney said he hopes this affair
will wake-up the American peo-
ple and start them thinking ration-
ally.

"I hope everyone is suspect
from now on. I think that's a good
thing.” he said.

 

Kunstler: I" hope’ everyone is sus-
pect from now on.

But he cautioned: “You don’t
save the country by indicting
John Mitchell. Nixon should be
driven out of office, but that is
not the end of it.‘ It’s like con-
victing Calley for mass murder.
The system is wrong.”

The real solution to the prob-
lem. said Kunstler. is to have a
thinking and activist people who
closely scrutinize the actions of
the government. But most Ameri-
cans. he said. are apathetic and

satisfied to waste their lives sit-

Provost’s Fund Otters Aid

to Pre-doctoral Students

By RITA VITOLO

The Provost's Development Fund. -in operation for the past three
years, offers financial aid to graduate students at. or near. their final
year of preparation for a doctoral degree. -

The awards. funded as a regular part of the University budget.
are granted on the basis of two criteria: financial need of the appli-
cant. and the extent of his completed work in fulfilling the degree
requirements of his department. Special attention is given to women
and members of minority groups. in an effort to increase the "min-
ority pool" of female and black personnel capable of filling faculty

and administrative positions within the University.
Don Henderson. assistant to the Provost.

according to

Offered to graduate students in those departments under the

Provost’s jurisdiction, the amounts of the grants vary.

Depending

upon the individual needs of the applicants, the awards can range
from a tuition stipend, living expenses, or a sum to cover dissertation
costs. Last year, 42 such awards were presented; approximately $55,-

000 was budgeted for the program.

Applications are screened by a review panel which includes

representatives of the Provost's office. the organization of Black Ad-
ministrators. Faculty. Students. and Staff (OBAFSS). the»Univel‘sity‘s
Women‘s Center. and the University Council on Graduate Study.
The program is part of the Affirmative Action Plans submitted to
the University by the Department of Health. Education. and Wel-

' fa re.

"Many people came to us." "according to Karen Gentleman. a"
member of the review panel. "who were eager to hire women and
blacks in their departments. but who claimed that there were none
to draw from within the University. Ideally. the students who we
_are helping through this program. will remain here at Pitt. but
many will probably go on toyother places. In any case. we are widen-

ing the"pool' al_l around." a

 

ting in front of a television
"watching Sanford And Son, I
Love Lucy, or some other drivel.“

Kunstler asked: "Where were
all the people who are now in-
censed at the bugging of Demo-
cratic headquarters when students
were killed at Kent State and
when the war was raging in
Vietnam?"

He said the United States ac-
cepted the same terms in the cur-
rent peace treaty as the Viet
Cong and the North Vietnamese
offered six yearsago.

“Now,” he said, “Nixon calls
it peace with honor.”

Presently in this country. said
Kunstler. we are experiencing a
deprivation of the rights of the
people by means of universal bug-
ging and the No-Knock Law.
which he sarcastically called "one
of the great achievements of
John Mitchell."

Then he spoke of Nan Pendrell.
the Chatham College professor
who was fired a year ago for
being over 65.

Allende '5 Chile Studied 

By SCOTT MacLEOD

Norman Gall. writer for the
American University field staff
and part-time journalist for the
New York Times spoke Thursday
on "Salvadore Allende and the
Crisis of the Chilean Left." The
event was sponsored and chiefly
attended by members of the
Center For Latin American Stu-
dies. ‘

Gall cited three central points '
of conflict within the present
Allende regime, which he said
has led the nation into its worst

shape, economically speaking,
since “the last world depres-
sion.”

The first crisis. according to
Gall. is_ the "tremendous infla-

tion which has attacked the
economy" since Allendes elec-
tionin 1971.

Among Allende's civil reforms
was ending unemployment in
Chile and beginning a mass
working force to “lift the people
into an era of advancement. As
a result ,.there are too many
workers in the factories of ur-
ban Chile in relation to the con-
sumer products which must be
produced.“

To cope with this problem,
Gall said, the Chilean govern-
ment has resolved to print more
and more currency to pay its debt
to the working class. This has
meant that Chile ultimately
produces 100% more capital in one
year than in the previous year
and this has obviously led to
nation’s abundant inflation.

Gall pointed ,out the wide-

spreadinflation in the United

States. 'where the money rate

Lack of Issues Believed

Source of Conservatism 

By MICHAEL CLINTON

Rising conservatism on col-
lege campuses was the topic of
an article written by Richard
Trubo of the Pittsburgh Press
(May 13. 1973).

The story contended that a
new movement to the right has
emerged among students. and
that a "new crusade on the na-
tionscampuses is looking to the
past. defending the traditional
American beliefs and way of
life."

William Markus, associate dean

. ‘of students and director of Stud-

ent Activities at Pitt, stated in
the article that the “lack of is-
sues” led to the decline in the
New Left interest. "He project-
ed that there “will not be/a high
level of political activity on Pitt’s
campus this fall, due to the de-
cline of such issues as the Viet-
nam War and the draft.”

He claimed that students are
more into their course work.
"Students are concerned with the
social issues of our time." he
said. “but not concerned with a

  Allende's Chile Studied

[Continued from Page 1)

He reported that in the late
1960’s he was in Chile to inter-
view Salvadore Allende. shortly
before he assumed office. At
that time Allende told Gall.
"Chile has no reason to import
foodstuffs. We have enough ara-
ble land for adequate produc-
tion."

Since then. Gall stated. Chile
has doubled its import quota
under President Allende. Gall
went on to say that these are the
type of problems that are hurt-
ing the Chilean economy and its
prospects for advancement.

Moreover, the world market
price on foodstuffs, such as
wheat, has risen and so Chile
is forced to pay a ceiling price
for its imports at a time of inter-
nal economic crisis.

which expropriates farm lands to
peasant formers on a regula-
tory basis. In this way. the gov-
ernment could control the food
market in socialist fashion in
hopes of strengthening that mar-
ket.

But according to Gall. who
has witnessed this plan in action
"the control is not working.“

He stated that only about one
tenth of the farmers are benefit-
ing from the government’s efforts,
and that CORA, the state agency
handling the reform, is having
difficulties in initiating land
takeovers.

This crisis is the direct cause
of the last crisis. according to
Gall. and is "Chile‘s number one
problem.“ He refers to the se-
vere conflicts of interest that oc-

alition.

the MIR. and the Christian De-

As a result of their discontent,
the MIR, a small and extremely
young party, has initiated and
carried out several land seizures
throughout arable land areas in
Chile, to rebut the actions of the
Allende government.

Nevertheless. Gall continued
that these conflicts of the govern-
mental coalition seem to be a
very serious threat to the Allende
regime. if not the Chilean na-
tion itself.

Following the lecture. the
floor was opened for discussion.
and one Bolivian student voiced
his disapproval of Gall‘s presen-
tation. "Mr. Gall. why is it that
you give one hour and fifteen

is either because you don’t know
or you don't care.“

Gall responded by insisting
that the purpose of the evening

lende and the Crisis of the Chil-
ean Left.' and not a seminar in
Chilean politics.

support of the weekend. “It is im-
portant to realize that actions like
this are oriented to raising peo-
ple‘s consciousness of the en-
vironmental factors.

“It is not a question of who is
legally responsible for the restor-
ation of riverfront resources, but
a question of public awareness of
the need for everyone’s involve-
ment in these issues,” he contin-
ued.

Victor S. Willem. a spokesman I

for the City Planning office.
stressed the aspect of public in-
volvement, “The city is happy to

The_ sight of Secretariat tearing

out of the club house turn, coupled
with the irregularities of the pay;
ing prices, leads one to believe
that the electric clock may indeed
have erred. '

Secretariat payed $2.60. $2.20.
and $2.10. although the automic
computer feedouts at the betting
windows revealed several other
sets of figures before deciding on
that one.

‘ The record handle of $922,898
was wagered for the most part on
-the~three top finishers. Secretar-
iat, Sham, and Our Native. Sham
‘played $2.20 to place or show. and
Our -Native also payed that
amount to its show bettors.

Secretariathad scared off most
of his challengers with his record-
‘setting performance in the Ken-
tucky Derby, and the six’-horse
field contributed to. the heavy
show betting. Turcottedidn’t have
to whip the horse in the Derby
either. ' -

Top-seeded Panther Joe Kantor
defeated a strongopponent in Wil-

Riggs
Sexes

by G. W. STEVENS

Bobby Riggs. the 55-year-old
superstar of tennis. did more than
establish male tennis supremacy
last Sunday when he defeated Aus-
tralia's Margaret Court in their
$12.500 winner-take-all match. If
appears that he also opened the
door for future male—female bat-
tles in the world of sports.

Immediately following the match

between Riggs and Court. it was
announced that Riggs would meet

-r/‘$8-year-old Christ Evert in an-

'1

other battle of the sexes on Sept.
22 in Fort Lauderdale. Fla. This
time the winner will come away
with $50,000 in prize money.

But, the challenges are not go-
ing to be limited to tennis match-
es. Other past notables are begin-
ning to realize that there is big
money in these popular rivalries.
Jimmy Demaret, the 60-year-old.
three-time Masters champion has
already issued a challenge of his
own. He has offered to play Kathy
Whitworth, the leading" money
winner of the Ladies Professional‘

""3olf Association. in an 18-hole, no

handicap match.

“This seems to be the thing to
do these days,” Demaret said.
“And if they want me to make it
a foursome, I’ll take a 62-year-old
man, Sam Snead, for my partner. .

War

Demarets statement about tells
the whole story. The Women‘s Lib
movement has prompted such riv-
alries due to the desires of wom-
en athletes to obtain purses equal
to those awarded to their male
counterparts. But the men argue
that they deserve the extra mon-
ey because the quality of their
performance is so much higher.
The only thing to do is to settle
the matter in open competition.
As a result, the athletes can take
advantage of the opportunity to
prove their superiority and make
some extra money.

'll|||lIlllll|||lll||||ll|||llE

Regardless of the outcome of
these matchups. the battle prob-
ably won’t end here. Billie Jean
King has already stated that she
is ready to meet Riggs anytime
he pleases. And, numerous other
challenges havegbeen issued in
other sports.

As long as the women feel they
aren‘t getting a fair shake. the
battle will go on. They feel they
deserve to be treated equally and
will do whatever they can to get
what they desire. Perhaps in the
future we can look for the East
End Debs, Pittsburgh’s World
Champion softball team, to chal-
lenge the Pirates to a game.
