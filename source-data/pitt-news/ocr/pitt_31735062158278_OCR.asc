known to the campus through the
Pitt News. The undergraduate
will then be the guest‘ of honor at
one of the Druids’ luncheons
where he or she will receive a
certiﬁcate of. merit.

Kent‘ Jarrell, president, com-
mented, “For too long a time,
' Druids has overlooked an im-
portant part of its Constitution
which reads, ‘Druids shall stim-
ulate interest in campus activi-
ties. foster and recognize out-
standing contributions to the
activities.’ _

“I feel that this new program
will not only recognize a job well-
done, but through this recogni-
tion, it will encourage others to
participate with a more intense
interest in beneﬁcial activities.”

Jarrell added that the program
will not tend to recognize officers
in organizations who have done a
capable job, but will acknowledge
those who have been leaders even
though their positions might be
minor.

The ﬁrst selection will be made
in February.

F roslt Boimhed‘
By Little Dukes
For F ifth Loss .

Failing again to ﬁnd the ‘right
combination, Coach Carl Peter-
son’s frosh dropped their ﬁfth
straight game, 83-44, to Duquesne
Monday night'at the Field House.

In the remaining ﬁve gminutes

_ of the ﬁrst half Duquesne tallied

six’ baskets and three foul shots
to hold a commanding 41-19 lead
at half-time. .

Fine ball handling and good
shooting on the part of Bill Strom
helped the Dukes to increase their
lead to 39 points at the,ﬁnal'buiz-
er. Strom led the Dukes with 25
while Clyde Arnold added 17
points.

' Although the Dukes were not
taller than the Cubs they con-
trolled the boards throughout

the game. -Using the same basic
pattern as the varsity, Duquesne
passed well and continually set
men up for easy jump shots.

Joe Schinitski and‘ Bob Sankey

led the Panthers in scoring with

11 points apiece. .

Julius Pegues, assistant fresh-'

man coach, had this to say con-

cerning the Cubs’ efforts -so far
this season. “The attitude as .far
as can be observed is very good,
but the fellows ,are still having
trouble working together.”

 

DON KASNER works out on the parallel bars as he prepares for

do not know how to advise our
boys for the different events,” de-
clared Neiger who is in his sev-
enth year as.head coach. _'
Syracuse will be without the
services of last year’s strong all-
event performer Walt Dodge.
Dodge is being “red—shirted” by
Romeo this season so that he can
improve on his all—event routine
and perhaps gain a. berth on the
1960‘U. S. Olympic Team.
Neiger is" deﬁnitely behind
the decision to withhold the
Orange star. “I believe the boy.
is really sincere and wants to
make the Olympic squad. The-
all—event has six events and he
‘needs at least a. year to improve
on his routines,” he said. - 7
The Panther coach believes his
boys can pile up many points in
tumbling and the ﬂying rings, at
leastbreak even in the high bar,
parallel bar, and side horse, but
ﬁgures to be outclassed in Syra-
cuse’s specialty, the rope climb.
“Dave Hirst leads the way in

Children’s Hospital will beneﬁt from the triple—header at

The Panthers and'Bisons will wind up the evening after

The Bisons, from Lewisburg,

They have captured eight of
11 games so far this season. The
victories were over Gettysburg,

Timmons is undecided on the

Timmonssaid. Mauro, a 5-9 jun-
ior, scored‘ 12 points against
Temple and showed a lot of
hustle in the Syracuse game last
Saturday. ‘ E '

Defense Blamed

Timmons blames a poor defense
and too many lost balls for the
‘Panthers’ ‘poor showing to date.
“Lou,” referring to his ‘assistant
coach Lou Iezzi, “tells the boys

just forget everything that they

- have learned‘ once the other team

brings the ball into their "zone.

“Another thing is that I have
had to play‘ many sophomores
.and when you play. those
youngsters it’s bound to cost you
a lot of baskets in either direc-'
tion,” the Panther coach con-
tinued. _

It has been disclosed that jun-
ior 'Lloyd Simpson‘ is deﬁnitely
out for the season due to a knee
cartilage" injury suffered against
Michigan in the ﬁrst game of the

season. Simpson had won a berth I
on the starting team before the‘

injury occurred.

Seating Poll

Of Students

Student ‘Government Associa-

tion voted Monday not to conduct
~ a poll of student opinion regard-

ing the proposal to charge stu-
dents, an admission fee to the
football games next fall.”

It ‘was voted, however, to y es-
tablish a special ﬁve-man com-
mittee to confer with the athletic

V department on matters of student

seating, date tickets, and other
questions pertaining to student
attendance at athletic events.

_ SGA felt that the proposed
,_ questions set forth by the poll-
ing committee would not have
been adequate to sample‘ stu-
dent opinion intelligently. SGA
also felt that the student body
is not sufficiently aware _of the
* issues -involved in the proposed
charge for tickets to render a
useful opinion on the subject.

In other SGA ‘business carried
on Monday, a motion by Linda
Hemmerich, Arts ’6l, that no Uni-
versity activities, such as Midday
Series, be _ scheduled during

' exams, was‘ defeated. The consen-

sus was that a student who did
not wish to study would be di-

verted by other things anyway;_.

cultural and athletic events
should be provided for those who
want them. *
