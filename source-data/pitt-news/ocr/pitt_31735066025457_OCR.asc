Politics is both a hobby and a career

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer

In a roundtable discussion,
local democratic politicians
and party officials ‘spoke
about the benefits.of political

in_volvement‘as a hobby and...
_ as a. career at ameeting of the

University Democrats _Friday
evening. -
“There are so many advan-

V . tages to being in politics,”
-36th district state representa-

tive Chris McNaly said_. “The
best and most important one,
in my opinion,,is the ability to
effect change. You get such a
good feel_ing from helping
others, from providing a ser-
vice to your constituents.”
McNaly named prestige and
being one’s own boss as other

advantages of being a politi-

cian.

According to McNaly, a stu-
dent who wants to pursue a
career in politics ‘must like all
types of people.

“You deal with such a wide
contact, from students to
senior citizens, union guys to
lawyers. I think it’s really

Democratic campaign man-
ager Nello Giorgetti stressed
volunteering in both national
and local elections. “You
‘don’t just learn to lick stamps,

ent ideologiesof both liberal

and conservative democrats,”
Giorgetti said. “Get involved
with Clinton headquarters.
They won’t bite you, they’ll
probably hug you.” '

Allegheny County Register
of Wills Jay Costa also empha-
sized student interest in poli-
tics. -

“Now it’s your turn, your
opportunity to get involved.
We need a wide range of
interests, especially at the stu-
dent level. Please continue to
show your support,” Costa
said.

Giorgetti dispelled three
standard ideas about politics.
One was the-honesty of politi-
cians. “There are more noble

people in politics than

world.”

Second, Giorgetti said that a
person does not have to come
fromla great family to be suc-
cessful in politics.

“Politics offers endless
opportunities. With hard work
and inspiration, it’s wide open
to whatever you’re interested
in,” he said.

T hree-peat may
delay graduation

By Christine Harma
News Editor

Pitt’s graduation may not be May 2, 1993 at the Civic Arena

' if the Pittsburgh Penguins have a playoff game.

“The Civic Arena has basically given the shaft to the univer-
sity,” Student Government Board President Gil Golden said at
an SGB meeting Friday. ,

The administration asked the SGB to add input about where
and when graduation can take place. “We, as eight people,
cannot make this decision for everyone and cannot know
what’s going to inconvenience students the most,” Golden
said at Friday’s meeting.

The graduation options being considered are having it May-

1, which is the Jewish Sabbath Day and could cause contro-
versy; having it on a week day, which would cause inconve-

nience for parents and relatives; having it the following’

Sunday, but students would have to stay an extra week or
come back just for the ceremony; or having it on campus May
2, which is the day of the Pittsburgh Marathon.

“Students should feel free to stop in our office any time as
soon as possible or to call our office with any suggestions or
comments,” Golden said. . . 3

Another job that SGB will take on is helping the homeless

people in the Pittsburgh area by participating in “Operation _

Save A Life.” .
Golden said that he hopes the student body will participate

by dropping off used coats, sleeping bags and blankets in the

the purpose for the chain was to show that “the church is tak-
ing its position — abortion is murder. It may be a harsh sign
but it is the reality of what it 

As the pro-lifers prayed and quietly held their signs, Pitt stu-
dent Linda Jarrett, dressed as a clown, ran up and down the
sidewalk chanting “Blah, blah blah.”

“It’s absolutely ridiculous that we’re still ﬁghting to have an
abortion. These people are using the name of God to infringe
on the rights of others,” she said.

Pro-life Baptist Sharon Hennen from the North Hills said she
was upset to see so many young people protesting the Life
Chain. 0

“It makes me sad to see a lot of young people taking such a
hard pro-choice side when they haven’t experienced life yet,”
Hennen said as nearby students chanted “Hey Hey, Ho Ho
George Bush has got to go.”

Assumption School seventh graders chanted back to the pro-
choice college students “Life not Death,” until their religious
teacher Mary Ann Bercini quickly hushed them up. I

Journalist Battalion.”

On the bus ride to West
Virginia I talked with Colonel
Michael H. Cassetori, Pitt’s pro-
fessor of Military Science.

“These kids will get to see
and do things they’ll never see
in the city,” the Colonel said.

I arrived at Camp Dawson
about 8 or 9 pm. I was told
we had to get our equipment
squared away (put our cloth-
ing and equipment in lockers)
and “lights out” was at 22:30
hours (10:30 p.m.). Bob sought
out cadet commanders who
could tell us what would hap-
pen on Saturday. Cadets wan-
dered back and forth talking
and eating. They would figure
out how much of the MRE’s
(food) contents they needed
for the field and how much
was not needed. The excess
food became bedtime snacks.

Some cadets took the chance
to heat the entree pouches

HAIR STUD

with a disposable heating
pouch they were issued, one
per MRE. A heater pouch is a
plastic bag with a chemical in
the bottom. When water is
poured into it a reaction
occurs, and it gets hot. The
reaction takes about 10 to 15
minutes to occur, according to
the instructions on the pack-
age.

“Ditch those MRE heaters.
You’ll never get time to use
them,” Bob said. He was cor-
rect. We were allotted 10 min-
utes to eat. When I packed my

ruck (backpack) for the next .

day, I left them behind in my
locker.

We knew the basics of what

was supposed to occur: the
Panther Battalion would be
broken down into eight
squads. (A squad consists of
10 or so people.) The squads-
would go from station to sta-
tion on the training course,
performing the required task

while senior cadets at each sta-

tion taught, looked on, timed,
graded and gave advice. The
course was supposed to be fun
but challenging.

The training stations were as
follows: -
-CPR certification.
°Rappelling.
-Survival. A squad learned
such things as how to con-
struct shelters, find and purify
water, etc. For example, don’t
drink from water where you
see beavers because they carry
many diseases.

-Grenade Assault course —
this was fun to watch. A squad
had to surmount various obsta-

cles (like barbed wire) and.

crawl up to a (simulated)

_bunker and throw grenade

simulators at it.

-Poncho raft. Squads broke
down into teams of two peo-
ple who then constructed rafts
with their equipment. They
constructed the rafts using two
ponchos, two rucksacks (back-
packs with frames), two
garbage bags, a stick and a
rubber duck (a life—size, hard-

rubber M-16 rifle simulator).
Once the rafts were construct-
ed, the squad had to assault
and occupy a small island in a
huge training pond.

-Rope bridge. A narrow por-
tion of the pond had two
poles on opposite sides of the
pond. A rope was tied across
the water and squads would
cross the simulated river by
attaching a rope to themselves
then hooking their harnesses
to the rope bridge by a metal
D—ring. They attached a rubber

Life after protest

Plato talked about it. Hobbes talked about it. So
did Rousseau. It’s discussed in the Bible and
mentioned in medical journals —— the question of
life. ' ‘

Ever since the beginning of humankind, ques-
tions about the value and genesis_of life have
been hotly_debated. The debate has taken several

 forms: genetic superiority, euthanasia and capital
. punishment among them. But nowhere, does it

seem, has the issue of life been debated more furi-
ously than when questioning the right of a woman
to choose to abort an unborn child.

Yesterday was no different. About 3,000 souls
lined the sidewalks of Forbes Avenue. and Fifth
‘Avenue — from Carnegie Mellon to Montefiore

0‘ Hospital — to Voice their opposition to abortion

through the National Life Chain. There were also a
significant number of pro-choicers present who
chanted about a woman’s right to choose.

This is a picture that many of us have seen

' before. And it is an issue that many of us feel

strongly about. But yesterday’s chain draws atten-
tion to an issue that has been clouded by both
sides of the fence. On one side there are those

 . referred to as pro-lifers who portray their oppo-
nents as “amoral abortion—demanding hounds.” On

the other side lies the pro-choicers who so often
portray their enemies as “women—hating body con-
trollers.”

CWO co—President Jennifer Swoboda said that
“anti-choice is anti-women” while former presi-
dent of Students for Life, Joel Garrett said that
“Pro-life is V-pro—women.” This shows_that both
sides, although claiming to fight for the health of
women, seem to be more concerned with mean—_
ingless terminology.

Rather than making assumptions about the other
side’s political or moral stand, both groups should
come together to work on decreasing the number
of abortions. A -

The only way to accomplish‘ this goal is to
increase the amount of information on how the
human body works and the implications of sexual
intercourse, which includes unwanted‘ pregnan-
cies. , .

This country informs all of it s citizens who wish

0 to drive a car of how a motor vehicle works and

the damage it can do. We should do no less with

’ our children and their bodies.

It may be trite to say’ that we get more accom-
plished by working together than by fighting one
‘another, but it’s true. Stop_fighting one another,
and remember why you are fighting. Let’s make it
easier for those concerned — women. -There’s the

* common ground. _ . '

The truth about Planned Parenthood

I love the way that people
who generallyIdon’1 give a
damn about African Americans
get so concerned about us
whenever it suits their needs.
In the Sept. 24 edition of The
Pitt News, Mr. Joel Garrett
wrote a’ column about Planned
Parenthood entitled “Welcome
to Banned Parenthood.”

The first line in the column
begins "As the leading proﬁteer
" Well, I’ve
spoken to friends, activists and
even people at Planned
Parenthood’s New York head-
quarters. Planned Parenthood
is, in fact, non-profit. From
there, he goes on to quote Lise
Fortier who he claims is the

medical director of Planned»

Parenthood of Los Angeles.
Well, — I called Planned
Parenthood, L.A., and Lise
Fortier doesn’t work there any-
more.

From there, Mr. Garrett gets
into‘ what really bugs me about
his column. His column is engi-
neered to create friction
between African Americans and
feminists. He brings up
Margaret Sanger and tosses
around a few quotes from the
‘30s‘and ‘40s. Apparently Ms.
Sanger had said some things
that were racially nuncool. This,
I would guess, means that the
entire organization is inherently
racist and is in fact theenemy
of all. people of color. Didn’t
George Washington own
slaves? I guess that means that
the United States is inherently
racist.

Even though I figured that
his argument itself didn’t hold
water, I called the Pittsburgh

0 division of Planned Parenthood

and asked them a few ques-
tions about Margaret Sanger.
According to them, Margaret
Sanger proposed the “Negro
Project” in response to a sug-
gestion of W.E.B. DuBois.
Goals for the project were:
°Reduction of the maternal
mortality rate of African-
American women — which at

the time was twice that of
white women. -

°Reduction of the African-
American infant mortality rate
- then 60 percent higher than
that of whites.

°Enabling women with
tuberculosis, heart disease, kid-
ney disease and other serious
diseases to avoid pregnancy.

-Enabling mothers to space

7

Letters  

‘their children at intervals of

two or three years. ,
Planned Parenthood also
commented on the quote “We
do not want the ‘word to get
out that we want to extermi-
nate the Negro population.”
According to Planned
Parenthood, the quote was
taken from a letter to Dr.
Clarence Gamble, a birth con-
trol activist, wherein she
stressed the importance of
explaining the project to the

« African-American ministers who

were to spread the word. They

did this because there were

people who were suspicious of
any white moves, and they “did
not want the word to get out”
that “they wanted to extermi-
nate the Negro population.” As
opposed to Mr. Garrett’s paint-
ing of a eugenicist conspiracy,
the quote here seems sensible.

Mr. Garrett tries to paint a
eugenicist picture of Faye
Wattleton as well. He followed
his earlier misquotes of Sanger
with Ms. Watt1eton’s quote “I
am proud to be walking in the
footsteps of Margaret Sanger.”
Is this to mean that former
Planned Parenthood President
Faye Wattleton wants to exter-
minate African Americans?
That’s interesting, considering
that Faye Wattleton is an
African American — a fact that
was carefully deleted from
Garrett’s article.

I got a copy of an April 1992
article from Family Planning

Perspectives. According to 1988
data, only 36 percent of all
abortions were performed

upon non-white women. This

is a bit different from the 53
percent reported by Mr.
Garrett. These questionable
numbers came from a journal
called Diversity. The column
was written by Andrew Zappia
who is the associate editor of
the Common Sense Guide to
American Colleges. The article
doesn’t mention where the data
came from. N
After this, Mr. Garrett begins
the false concern segment "of

, his column._ He’ goes into dis-

cussing the class ramifications
of abortion. He mixes a state-
ment about class and race giv-
ing the impression that being a
minority and being poor are
synonymous. -I know Mr.
Garrett personally. Knowing
that he is and has for years
been an ardent Bush supporter,
I am forced to question Mr.
Garrett’s level of concern for
the poor. He follows this up
with his concern for how abor-
tion “physically damages the
woman’s body and psyche  “
If Mr. Garrett had concern
about women after they were
born, this wouldn’t be an issue.
In fact, if he thought_that
women were valuable enough
to think for themselves, this
again wouldn’t be an issue.

Mr. Garrett’s column says to
me that he thinks that women,
and particularly minority
women, aren’t capable of mak-
ing important decisions for
themselves. I received 11 pages
of information on abortion
from Planned Parenthood, so
the information is available on
abortion. If a woman chooses
to talk to someone about abor-
tion, Planned Parentl1ood’s ads
point them in the right direc-
tion. Oh yeah, by the way,
Planned Parenthood doesn’t
currently perform abortions.

  SHELL-SHOCKED

Terrapins blast Panthers 4 7-34 in shootout

_ Byjeremy Swarbrick
/; )Sta_[f Writer

COLLEGE PARK, Md. —- The offense
was supposed to carry a questionable
defense for the Pitt football team. It did

. its part with 552 yards of total offense

(‘I

and 32 points against Maryland. It was

' not enough.

Maryland’s run-and-shoot, no—huddle
offense rolled up a total of 557 ‘yards
and two school records en route to "a

47-34 thrashing of the Panther squad

Saturday night at Byrd Stadium.

Senior quarterback John Kaleo com-
pleted 24 of 37 passes for 415 yards
and three touchdowns, setting a new
school record for the most passing
yards in a single game to lead the
T erps (1-4) to their first victory under
rookie head coach Mark Duffner.

Maryland split end Marcus Badgett
also had a record—setting day, hauling
in 11 catches for a new school one-
game high of 251 yards and two touch-
downs.

Not to be outdone offensively were
the Panthers, who were led by the arm
of quarterback Alex Van Pelt and the
legs of running back Tim Colicchio.
Van Pelt finished the evening complet-
ing 26 of 46 passes for 395 yards and
four touchdowns. 1

IQ)‘ Colicchio added 156 yards-on 22

Pl‘.

carries while the Panthers also rolled
up an impressive 552 yards total
offense. _

It was, however, the defense that let
this game get out of ‘hand.

Pi_ttsburgh opened up the game
strong by taking the opening kickoff
and jumping out to a 3-0 lead on a 21-
yard field goal by kicker Sean Conley. 1

After Maryland’s Dave DeArmas
bounced his 45-yard field goal attempt
short off of the crossbar, Pitt took over
on offense. '

The Panthers marched down the

field and capped a four play, 71-yard
drive when Van Pelt hit a wide
open Rob Coons at the one and the big
tight end danced into the end zone,
giving the Panthers a 10-0 lead and
silencing most of the 35,891 fans in
attendance.
' -But as they would do all night, the
Terpsstruck back swiftly and severely,
capitalizing on poor tackling. Badgett
caught a 37-yard pass to set up a one-
yard scoring plunge byrunning back
Larry Washington to cut the lead to 10-
7. '

After a missed field goal, Maryland
took over again and Kaleo picked apart

the Panther secondary, finding his
favorite target, Badgett, 33 yards down
field for a touchdown that gave the
Terps their first lead 14-10. .
Maryland increased its lead to seven
on a 32-yard David DeArmas ﬁeld goal.

Terps took the opening half possession
70 yards, culminating in a 19-yard
touchdown to Badgett from Kaleo.

The game’s tide began to shift again
when, following an interception by Pitt
strong safety David Sumner, the

 

  

   

Pitt answere just e ore t e ,
settling for a 19-yard Conley kick, after
coming away just inches short from
scoring the’ potential tying touchdown
to make the score?17-13 at the end of
two quarters.

Maryland’s run-and-shoot continued
to blow holes in Pitt’s defense as the

   

Pan ers too over e a W1
field position. As the offense rolled
down ﬁeld, Van Pelt took advantage of
the situation and found Dietrich Jells in

the end zone for an 18-yard score that

cut the deficit to 24-19.
Pitt’s defense held Maryland on its
next possession, and with the momen-

good”

turn clearly on its side, capped a 76-
yard, four-play drive that only spent 26
seconds off the clock with a 41-yard
touchdown pass to Bill Davis. Davis
managed to slip into the back of the

end zone unnoticed by the Maryland ‘_
defense.

After a successful two-point conver-
sion, the Panthers had their first lead
since the opening quarter, 27-24.

That would be all the celebrating Pitt
would do on this night. Terps quarter-
back Kaleo continued to ambush the
Panthers all night long without any

- pressurelfrom a Panther defensive front _

that was kept in check all night.

Maryland regained the lead just 1:44
later as another long reception by
Badgett set up a one-yard keeper by
Kaleo.

The score increased in the fourth
quarter on a 15-yard touchdown pass
to wide receiver Wade Inge but failed
to convert the point after, making the
score 37-27. ‘

The missed PAT was the firstfor S

Maryland in 190 attempts — a record
that was set back in the 1984 season. -

A DeArmas field goal and a nine- 1

yard touchdown burst from backup
superback Doug Burnett rounded out
the scoring for the Terps.

Burnett entered the game when
Maryland’s star superback Mark Mason
suffered a season-ending shoulder
injury in the game’s first quarter. The
Terps also lost the services of running
back Larry Washington, who will be
out indefinitely with a bruised knee.

Van Pelt, who was knocked down
and almost out on a vicious hit by

‘defensive back Andre Vaughn,

bounced back in his next_series to fin-
ish the scoring with a 12-yard touch-
down pass to Chris Bouyer. Bouyer,
who ended the evening with 10 catch-
es for 128 yards and one touchdown,
had some high praise for his quarter-
back after the game. ‘ .

“Alex played great today,” Bouyer
said. “People criticize him a lot and say
he is not that great, but he is a great

quarterback, probably one of the best

in’ the nation.”

Next week, Pi has the honor of
hosting the nationally ranked Fighting
Irish, who not only boast one of the
nation’s best offenses but have given
Pitt some fits in the recent past. After
this ‘past week’s shocking loss to

-Stanford, Notre Dame will undoubtedly

be looking for some revenge and the
Panthers suspect defense will be stand-

Volleyball coach sends message daring team's erratic wee/eena’

Cory Walborn
Staff Writer

Melanie Gustafson huffed-

and puffed. The match was
already over, but the hard work
had just begun. Running down

this ball, diving for that ball, ’

exhaustion was setting in. '
Gustafson staggered but

would not quit. She went’

through these post-game drills
like every member of the Pitt

.¢.z...‘..-.,.__

volleyball team. At the end, a
hyperventilating Gustafson
finally stepped aside.

These digging drills were a
message sent from head coach
Sue Woodstra. Woodstra, who
was disappointed with Pitt’s
lethargic victory over Boston
College last Friday, was making
her team go “all out”' for every
ball she hit at them. Her aim
and message was to be mental-
ly tough —- a weak area that

Pitt needed to rectify.

The message seemed to get
through as Pitt solidly demol-
ished Akron early Saturday.
That was not so apparent that
night as the Panthers lost their
second Big East match of the
year to the Friars of
Providence.

The weekend started inno-
cently enough as Pitt faced a
lowly 1-9 Boston College team
on Friday. Using an array of

players throughout the match,
Pitt won in three straight games
15-12, 15-9 and 15-10.

Game one seemed routine as
junior Ann Marie Lucanie start-
ed things off with two quick
kills as Pitt darted out to a 6-2
lead.

With several mistakes by
both teams, Pitt and Boston
College traded points on their
way to a 12-12 tie. Sophomore
outside hitter Chelsea

Hemingway then sparked a
three-point surge that gave Pi
a 15-12 win. j
Controlling the beginning of
game two, the Eagles ﬂew to a
6-1 lead. Pitt crawled its way
back, but Boston College still

‘held a two-point margin at 9-7.

Then Carrie ‘Thornton began
to shine. The sophomore fired
six straight serves and gave Pitt
a 12-9 lead. Thornton did a lit-

Hoyas end soccer winning streak

By Brian Gallagher

Senior Staff Writer

The streaks are over.

Hoyas’ forward Ben
McKnightVscored a second
half goal, and goalie Pat
Wellington made three saves
to power Georgetown past
Big East co-leader Pitt, 2-1,
at Harbin Field in

Washington, D.C. yesterday.

The loss ended two

ALP  

impressive victory runs for
the Panthers, a seven-game
overall win streak and four
in a row in conference
play. Their last loss was
Sept. 6 to Bucknell
University (5-2) Pitt fell to
7-3 overall and 4-1 in the
Big East. Georgetown is 7-2
overall, 2-2 in league play.
Midfielder Michael Basaca
scored the Panthers’ lone
tally with 14 minutes left in

EPSI

the second half on a
rebound of a perimeter shot,
but Pitt could not penetrate
the Hoyas’ defense for a late
tying score. Georgetown
outshot the Panthers, 15-10,

and held a 9-7 corner kick

advantage.

The Hoyas jumped out to
a 1-0 halftime lead on a
blast by senior forward Tom
Dillow at the midway point

Cross ‘men run
sixth aswomen Win

By Jim Clark
Staff Writer

Pitt’s men's cross country
team finished sixth on
Friday at the Notre Dame
Invitational.

According to distance
coach Jim Lear, the compe-
tition was pretty solid with

‘. three top 20 teams compet-

ing (Notre Dame, Eastern
Michigan and Michigan).

“It was a pretty strong
field,” Lear commented.
“We ran OK yesterday. We
ran solid.”

Pitt’s top finisher at the
meet was senior co—captain
Waddie Freeman, who
placed 19th.

Junior Mike Lynn finished
29th, sophomores Frank
Nesko and Mike Umbleby
placed 35th and 57th
respectively while first—year
student Matt Clarkson fin—
ished 62nd.

What impressed Lear
about his team’s perfor-
mance at the meet was that
only 45 seconds separated
Freeman from Clarkson.

After three meets, Pitt’s
only injury to speak of is a
calf injury to senior co—cap-
tain Tom Swartout. Lear
said that he expects
Swartout will be back soon.

The women’s team won
its field at the Robert Morris
Invitational on Saturday

tle bit of everything as she
helped the Panthers ﬁnish out

game two 15-9.]

After jumping out to a 4-0
lead in game three, Pitt seemed
a little slow, and Boston
College came back totake a 6-
5 advantage. After exchanging
points, Thornton took over
again with scrappy hustle and
relentless defense to propel Pitt
to a 15-10 win.

The win evened Pitt’s Big
East record at 1-1 but did not
impress Woodstra. '

“We are trying to work on
being mentally tough, and that
is one of the reasons we had
the exercise after the game,”
Woodstra said of the post-game
drills on Friday.

“We took a step backward
last week,” Woodstra said,
referring to Pitt’s surprising-loss
to Villanova a week earlier.
“We have to work things out
right now.”

Working things out would
happen soon enough as Pitt

played Akron on Saturday. The '

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, October 5, 1992

Zips made several mistakes
early in_ game one and were
bothered by a Pitt wall of
blocks, thus falling down 7-0
quickly.

Senior Karen Godzinski’s
jump serve brought Akron back
and cut the Panthers lead to 8-
5. But then Pitt started to put
things together. Thornton and
Gustafson provided the

offense, and first-year player

Laura Horvath provided the
excellent defense as Pitt
zapped the Zips 15-5.

In game two, Pitt first-year
players Sarah Mikla and Alyssia
Yanik dominated early and
gave the Panthers a 7-2 advan-
tage.

The Zips tried to fight back
but Pitt’s Thornton connected
on several thunderous back-
row spikes that sent Akron
reeling as the Panthers took
game two, 15-7.

After the Zips took a 5-1 lead
in game three, the Panther
scrapped back into the match.

Matching sideout for sideout

and point for point, the

Panthers gained the upper
hand. Then, following a
Thornton kill and a Gustafson
block, Pitt ran out the Zips, 15-
10. .

“We played very stable and
did the things we should have
done,” Woodstra said. “I would
like to think last night’s exer-
cise had something to do with

that.”

So Woodstra’s methods were
proving to be correct. Pitt
played better against a better
team. It lacked no hustle and
went “all out” for every ball.
The Panther question mark was
answered —- at least for a cou-
ple oflhours.

That was of course until 7:30
p.m., when the most highly
anticipated match of the week-
end started — a newly rejuve-
nated Pitt team against an
always tough Providence. '

In game one, Providence
routed the mistake—prone
Panthers and led 8-0 before Pitt
scored a point. Using junior
Missy Dawson’s . serve,
Providence extended its lead

13-3. With this huge margin,
Pitt could not come back and
lost its first game of the week-
end, 15-5.

After a shaky beginning, the
Panthers regained their mental
edge in game two and were
determined not to lose.
Horvath’s and Thornton’s
serves spurned on Pitt to an
easy 15-5 win.

In game three, Pitt exploded
for nine straight points and
looked as if it had taken con-
trol of the match. Erasing all
doubts of game one’s drubbing,
the Panthers looked mentally fit
to shatter any Providence
hopes for an upset. But a 9-0
lead was not good enough.
The Friars started to play more
consistent as Pitt slowly fell
apart.

Providence put together a 15-
to—one run against the Panthers
and not only defeated Pitt 15-
10, but seemed to raisemore
questions about Pitt’s consisten-
cy as a team.

The questions were not
about to go away in game four

as Providence, led by Aileen
Koprowski, ran eight straight
points to take a comfortable 9-4
lead. Pitt’s Lucanie did every-
thing possible to make Pitt’s
fortunes change, reeling off
several well-placed spikes.

But Providence took
Lucanie’s tremendous spikes in
stride and beat Pitt on its home
court 15-9 and three games to

' one.

“Unlike Boston College and
Akron, Providence is a good
team,” Woodstra said. “They
are a taller team with a better
setter and better blocking.

Pitt’s Big East record now
falls to 1-2 (7-6 overall). But the
record is not what worries
Woodstra. It is the questions
that arise from such a loss.
Questions of youth, inconsis-
tency and mental toughness
that surround the Pitt volleyball
team. '

“The problems won’t be
solved in a day or a week,”
Woodstra said. “It [solving the
problems] is a season—long
process. 5

yards.

The Maryland record was
previously held by Dan
I-Ienning, who threw for 567
yards against North Carolina
in 1986.

Senior wide receiver
Marcus Badgett blew an
existing Terrapin record out
of the water.

He broke James Milling’s
record of 220 yards receiving
in one game by catching 11
passes for 251 yards.

Milling set his record on
only five receptions against
North Carolina in 1986.

Badgett also caught two
touchdown passes, helping

*Maryland score 47 points.

That was the most a Terrapin
team has scored in a game in
10 years.

However, one Maryland
record streak came to an end
when kicker David DeArmas
missed the extra point after
his team scored its fifth
touchdown. That broke a
streak of 190 straight PAT’s
converted by Maryland kick-
ers over the last eight years.

The Terrapins only punted
once in the entire game -
late in the third quarter.

The Maryland offensive
records fell almost effortlessly
as the rest of the game
consisted of the Terrapins
running and passing up
and down the field almost "at
will.
