Rubenstein Refuses to

  Attend Artists’ Dinner

Held at University Club

Richard Rubenstein, Director of B’nai B’rith Hillel
Foundation and University Chaplain refused to attend the
annual dinner of the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh held
at the University Club Tuesdayevening. .

A member of the Associated Artists had invited Rabbi

Rubenstein to attend the group’s annual dinner. He pro-~

tested the decision of a non-denominational organization to convene
at a place where all members cannot go with equal dignity.

In an open letter to Professor Jerry Caplan, president of Asso-
ciated Artists, Rabbi Rubenstein said: “Art knows no boundaries of
race or religion. By its decision to hold the dinner at the University
Club, the Associated Artists has forced Pittsburgh art lovers to choose
between attending an event at an institution whose policies deny
equal dignity to all men, or to
refrain from participating in this
even .” '

the University
Club has been

cial University
functions. Rabbi
R u b e n s t e i n
pointed out that
“It is a matter Rubenstein
of public record that the Univer-
sity Club bars Jews, Negroes, and
people of Southern European des-
cent from its membership.”

Commenting to The Pitt News,
Rabbi Rubenstein stressed that
he is not protesting the Club's
discriminating policies: “Any pri-
vate social club has the right to
choose as members anyone it
wants and bar whomever it
chooses. I question the advisibil-
ity of such public organizations
as the Associated Artists holding
meetings there.”

Rabbi Rubenstein expressed his
hope that “public organizations
will not meet in segregated in-
stitutions_ As long as membersof
my faith are not regarding as good
enough to be associated as mem-
bers, I will not enter the Club.”

Student evaluation of distribu-

fall will be made available to un-
dergraduates, faculty and all in-
terested parties, the Liberal Arts
Cabinet announced yesterday.

“The evaluations were com-
piled ﬁom the results of ques-
tionnaires which were distributed
to students‘ who had previously
taken 80 or 180 courses and
whom the cabinet considered
academically responsible,” Cabi-
net Chairman Tom Zaret said.

Three main advantages would
accrue from the course analy-

ses. First, information not or-

dinarily available would be
placed at the disposal of students
interested in distribution courses
offered in the School of Liberal

deal with speciﬁc course compon-

Dean Treats Morals  

- By BONNIE STONE
Dean of Students Helen Pool Rush, commenting on
“Morals in Our Society,” advised students Tuesday night to
regard each other “as men and women, not males and fe-
males.” She spoke to a crowded audience in Tower A, at one
of the Men’s Dormitory Council lecture series. -
Moral obligations, Miss Rush said, are much broader
than people consider. They include health, intelligence, and
and aesthetic sensitivity and they demand that a student regard-
others as a source of interest, respect “material things of this earth,”
and have an awareness of the power of gossip. . "
Referring to her stress on the concept of “men” and “women,”
Miss Rush explained: “All culture, reﬁnement, beauty, and love. arbe

Pittsburgh Symphony     

.._/A

’\\\\\\\\\\\

ByBILL SMITH

This weekend Carlo Giu-
lini will conduct the Pitts-
burgh Symphony in ‘his sec-
ond and last pair of sub-
scription concerts. The pro-
gram will consist of Verdi's
“Overture to La Forza del
Bestino,” William Walton‘s “Con-
certo for Violin and Orchestra,”
and Beethoven’s “Symphony No. 6
in F Major” (the Pastorale).

Those who attend will hear one
of the finest violinists of our time,
Zino Francescatti, who will per-
form in the Walton work. Fran-
cescatti has been described by
Jay Harrison, the critic of the
New York Herald Tribune, as “a
musician whose perfection, in

fact, has become a habit . . .”
The Walton concerto, ﬁrst per-
formed in 1939, is a well con-
structed work abounding in sing-
ing melodies and exciting rhyth-
mic passages. As the world un-
folds, it becomes clear that the
violin will dominate, indicating
Walton's belief that the purpose
of a concerto should be to dis-
play the virtuosity of the soloist.
The Verdi overture is one of
the few he wrote for symphonic
performance. Rather than write
the overture in the classical sona-
ta, form, Verdi used it to an-
nounce some of the more impor-
tant motives and themes in the
opera. The agitated "four-note mo-
tive heard throughout the work
symbolizes the violence and trit-

John Griffin Tells Audience
Of His Experience as Negro

By RUTH LEVIKOFF

John Howard Griffin, sociolo-
gist, told an overﬂow Midday
crowd how he responded to a
Negro’s comment: “the only way
you could understand my situa-
tion is if some morning you woke
up in my skin.”

Students sat on the floor and
leaned azainst pillars, listening
to Griﬂin relate the intense anti-
pathy he felt when he saw a
Negro face in the »mirror——his
face darkened by chemical treat-
ments. Although he was intellec-
tually opposed to racism and dis-
crimination, he suddenly realized
that he, too, had the white prob-
lem of not seeing beyond pig-
mentation.

He was constantly amazed that
he could be treated so diﬁerent-
ly merely because his skin was
black, though he had the same
‘name, same background, and per-
sonality.

When the best accommodations
he could get as a. Negro were a

small, windowless, tadry room,
he remembered the luxurious ho-
tels he had stayed in as a white
man. When the only jobs he
could get were those of a shoe-
shine boy. porter, and truck load-
enherealizedthatasawhite
man with the same -qualiﬁcations,

he would not even consider such

occupations.

As a Negro, Griffin soon"‘l'earn-_

—ed to call white men who be-
friend Negroes only for scan-
dalous reasons “Good White Bud-
dies.”

Urging Americans to stop think-
ing in terms of being pro-white
or pro-Negro and start concern-
ing themselves with being pro-
human, Griﬂin exhorted: “Cry

_out in any injustice.”

   

edy that befalls the heroine and
her family in the ensuing acts of
the opera.

The Beethoven symphony is
best known for its statements
about the relationship between
Man and Nature. Thus, we hear
the nightingale, the quail, .and
the cuckoo, as well as the most
famous storm music in musical
literature. Beethoven stated, how-
ever, that he was primarily con-
cerned with the expression of
human moods and that tonal
scene-painting was secondary to
this.

With the intelligent and dra-
matic conducting of which Giulini
is capable, the cr ._.:ert promises
to be a good one.

be required of dormitory stu-
dents,” Stern commented.

>Possible affiliation of SG
with a national student organi-
zation. “We are one of the few
major campuses that does not be-
long to a national organization,”
he said.

> Total ﬁnancing of student
publications by the student activ-
ities fund,

D Creation of some sort of in-
tellectual environment where in-
tellectual dialogues could take
place.

> Activities Fee. Stern feels
that there should be an activities
fee but that “control of it should
be totally up to SG and the
amount should be kept reason-
able.”

“Some of the proposals can be
worked on immediately.” he said.
“Others will take quite a bit of
time and will probably result in
slowly obtaining concessions from

the administration over a long .

period of time.”
Stern feels that “the adminis-
tration has taken the prerogative
where SG has failed to act in the
past."
“I hope to represent anew spir-
‘ it on campus which will have an
intellectual atmosphere rather
than the four year process of ac-
culturation where you create the
‘Organization man,”’
eluded.

Student Cooperation

Desired byAble Party

(Continued from Page 1)
Also, he is a member of Druids;
Phi Eta Sigma, freshman men’s
honorary; Omicron Delta Kappa,
senior men’s honorary, and Sig‘-
ma Tau, national engineering
honorary.

Believing that “no president of
SG can be effective unless he can
work with other heads of organi-
zations,” Lefton wants to con-
tinue to improve the co-operation
of other student leaders on the
Student Affairs Committee. “Peo-
ple stress all kinds of ideas in
terms of getting things done, but
no group can get things done if
they alienate other students,”
Lefton commented.

The party platform contains
solutions to existing problems,
according to Hogan. “While the
suggestions and proposals might
not be radical changes, I think it
has signiﬁcance in that it indi-
cates a continuation of the trend
started this past year under John
Vrana,” he said.

Some speciﬁc areas which Lef-
ton and Hogan would like to see
investigated include:

>Placing of old examinations
on ﬁle in the library. “This would
give all students a chance to look
up past exams,” Lefton comment-
ed, “and also it would force the
faculty to constantly revise their
exams. ‘ A
. > Greatly increased participa-
tion of students in SG particular-
ly and in all students activities
generally. This could be done by
delegating responsibility to vari-
ous senators without waiting for
them to volunteer, according to
Hogan.

It could also be implemented
through fair distribution of funds
derived from the activities fee
and the 50-50 proﬁt sharing plan
with the University Book Center.

> An attempt to do something

 

about the parking situation. “This
is a virtually insolvable situation,
but we can try,” Hogan comment-
ed. The party advocates the use
of vacant land on the University
campus as a low-cost or no-cost
student parking lot,

>Lefton feels that the pro-
posed activities fee has deﬁnite
good for all students. “I want to
see the fee handled by the stu-
dents and I want deﬁnite com-
mitment from the administration
that the student affairs appropri-
ation will not be jeopardized in
any way.”

Lefton would like to see a pro-
portional. plan set up whereby
as the money from an activities
fee increases, the student affairs
appropriation would increase pro-
portionally.

Both candidates feel that “if I

whatever opposition parties which
might develop sincerely feel that
there are no better qualiﬁed in-
dividuals than those who are rim-
ning for president, and vice-pres-
ident, certainly we would ‘think
that they would have conﬁdence
in our judgment to want to place
conﬁdence in our selection .of a
slate of senators.

The party is also interested in
seeing “our resolutions imple-
mented as quickly as possible
while at the same time avoiding
the -bureaucratic run-around.

  Problems 

V The 1965 Student Government election marks a dynamic change in student atti-
' tude on this campus with the commendable, noteworthy competition of a two-party sys-

    

tem. The Able Party, winning over independent foes for the two years of its existence,
this year faces the Pitt Progressive Party, ﬁnally offering the student some choice of
political philosophy and some identifying factor among the masses of senatorial candi-

dates.

Both in essence are ﬁghting for student leadership and the improvement of the
student’s position on this campus. Both push towards an ID card, a co-operative Book

. Center, re—examination of advising and course offerings, among others, all concrete at-

tacks on speciﬁc student problems to be dealt with through student initiative, all a far
cry from simply a presidential contest or an over-powering one-party system.

There are still some obvious drawbacks in the way the innovation was introduced
this year. First of all, the PPP is not supporting a presidential or vice-presidential can-
didate: they propose a senate but can give no assurance that their planks could be car-
ried out because they offer no choice of party leader. Indeed, their senate members could
be elected, but their effectiveness as far as following speciﬁc party planks will be limited
by the views of the president and vice-president who will, of necessity, be of the opposi-

tion.

In another vein, the PPP offers only senatorial candidates from the School of Lib
eral Arts, certainly the largest undergraduate school numerically -but still only part of
the total student body; this offers a rather limited scope to the party interest which
should, if it is to be respresentative, cross all school lines.

There is only one person in opposition to the Able party candidates, and unfortun-
ately he does not have a running mate. If students vote with an eye to how the total
setnate will work together, his chances may suffer because he does not have a ready-’

made support.

The problems are certainly there, but we hope that the idea of a two-party system
will spread next year to more intense and evenly balanced competition —— of candidates
as well as party philosophy. The groundwork is commendable. L

 

Pay Attention
To Non-Cheater

Editor, The Pitt News:

Discussions of cheating are un-
doubtedly both healthful for the
academic community and disrup-
tive of it. But I suspect that the
recent discussions in this paper
have focused far too much atten-
tion on the cheater and far too
little on those who will not cheat.
The latter are far more interest-
ing to me, and far more worthy
of attention.

The actions of the teacher in
regard to cheaters affects not
only them, but the non-cheaters
as well—those valiants who de-
sire education and want to learn

, are far too precious to me to turn

my classrooms into that of a
guard. Doing so does not diminish
the cheaters (they seek new de-
vices), but it reflects unfairly and
cruelly on the motivations of|
those who have an emotional in-
vestment in ‘the learning process.
Learning, after all, is an exercise
in freedom and freedom does not
fare well in prisons. I- am re-
luctantly willing‘ to suffer the
depradations on morality inﬂict-

‘ ed by those who cheat to pre-

serve an atmosphere in which
those who wish to learn can
ﬂourish.

. The professor's role is, after
to illustrate
through his own behavior the
joys of a life of learning; to open
doors through which people who
wish to. may walk and enjoy new
experiences; to reveal his own en-
thusiasm for learning so others
may learn; to always display the
sense of tentativeness with which
scholars hold knowledge, so
younger scholars will wish to

;' ,venture into a mystifying and

challenging world of uncertainty,
frail data, and inadequate con-

clusions. He who will cheat to‘

“succeed” is depriving himself
of an exciting journey, but he is
only afflicting others when the
teacher arranges a system in
which the cheater can have im-

 pact on others with different de-

sires. Grading on a curve is one
such cruel system device: I sus-

_ pect that the multiple choice test»
' is another. ~

 

I am inadequately trying to
say that we should pay more at-
tention to the learner and less
attention to the abuser. This
probably implies more freedom
rather than less and a presump-
tion of interest and innocence
rather than the casting of sus-
picious eyes on all of our stu-
dents. A

Admittedly, the cheaters may
beneﬁt by this kind of policy.
They may get their admission
cards to middle class society. But
the other students will beneﬁt
more for they will get the chance
to explore without fear of the
omnipresent curve and the haz-
ard of memorizing the wrong
fact for the wrong test. I do not
condone the cheater but neither
will I dignify him by paying so
much attention to his problems
that I forget those who do not
cheat. We must direct our ener-
gies at making an education
worthy of those who will take
intellectual advantage of it, rath-
er than so governing our be-
havior that we catch the greatest
number of cheaters.

As to those who cheat and ra-
tionalize this behavior by say-
ing that the social system forces
them into it, I can feel’ only pity.

Societies are composed of indi- .

viduals and traditional social ar-
rangements, This diversion of
guilt to a mystical entity outside
themselves which somehow over-
powers their right to choose is a
pitiful sham which itself is illus-
trative of how much they have
failed to gain from participating
in the active pursuit of know-
ledge,

Let us attempt then to ﬁnd
methods for the improvement of
our own abilities to learn and be
challenged and respond to in-
tellectual demands. Let - those
who cheat see how much more
promising and rewarding the
search for understanding can be
than is the search for better
grades. And those who cheat may
then join us in the fun of learn-
ing.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR I

Cheating Solution
Called Unfeasible

Editor, The Pitt News:

Humble, hard working students,
such as you and I, wholehearted-
ly agree with such enlightened
minds as Marie Kukich. “Let's go
Pitt!” (The Pitt News, Feb. 8.)
We eagerly form a line behind
her hard hitting shoulders, and
beg her to lead us from this den
of iniquity, and up the righteous
path of honesty and perfect
truth, provided, of course, she
knows the way.

But, we sincerely doubt this.
Cheating is as old as the Univer-
sity itself, and simple demands
do no more than ﬁll columns of
The Pitt News with fruitless, hu-
morous, and almost naive ideal-
ism.

Certainly, no mature and rea-
sonably honest student condones
cheating, but we're afraid if we
wait for Marie Kukich’s solution
to the problem, we will graduate
with a diploma from the Cathe-
dral of Hypocrisy,

Over Comment

Editor, The Pitt News: ~

Someone once said that ignor-
ance is Bliss, and the Feb. 1 Pitt
News article on cheating certain-
ly seems to prove this.

It was a traumatic experience
to learn that we commuters are,
in Mr. Cartwright’s own words,
“. . . a particular problem . . .”
in an otherwise perfect academic
Utopia,

We, the undersigned, are truly
sorry that we have caused the
standards of the University to be
lowered, But why doesn’t anyone
in the administration or the fac-
ulty complain when we pay our
$700?

Luce Journalism

  By Allan Schlosser .

. Time magazine, fortunately or unfortunately, has made
[aim imprint on_ modern history. _It represents a revolutionary
eve opment in contemporary Journalism: the advent of the

\ mass-circulation news weekly.

_“ If one is to believe its immodest masthead, Time is a

Weekly news. magazine ’ written for the American “leader-
ship community. At the very outset, therefore, I feel com-
pelled to state ﬁnally and unequivoc-
ally that I am not now, nor have I
ever been, a subscription- carrying
member of this leadership elite. Be-
ing an outsider, however, carries with
it the advantages of freer expression
and greater objectivity.

One wag, writing recently in The
Realist, dubbed Time “the weekly fic-
tion magazine.” Such charges stem
in part from the “news dialogues”
_ contrived by the editors for middle-
-  " brow consumption. I recall one issue
_  in which appeared a verbatim account
of a private conversation between Caroline Kennedy and her
brother J ohn-John.

 

ANOTHER OF Time’s favorite devices is to include
anonymous quotations _in its -articles. In a recent feature on
the teenager in America, for example, one of Time’s more
enterprising reporters presumably invaded the sanctity of
3. Louisville, Ky, home and managed to record the dinner
conversation: “When a 16-year-old Louisville boy, as a
practical joke, gravely announced at dinner that his girl
friend was pregnant, the ﬁrst reaction of a stunned family
came from the boy's younger brother, 13. ‘My God,’ he said.
‘You’ll_ lose your allowance’.”

Time, in addition to its other heavy responsibilities,
keeps a sharp eye on the American intellectual (it is ironic
that a magazine which admires, and purports to speak for,
a politico-ﬁnancial leadership community should so thor-
oughly distrust the nations intellectual community). Sev-
eral years ago Time found an intellectual hero in Herman
Wouk, author of The Caine Mutiny.

V_V(_)UK WAS consequently proclaimed as “one of the
few living U.S. writers who carries no chip on his shoulder
and who gives the U.S. straight A's in his fictional report
cards.” In the novels of Wouk, Time found a reaction against
a century -dominated by “skeptical criticism, sexual emanci-
pation, social protest, and psycho-analytical serinonizing.”
Wouk had unknowingly become what Time would eventually
call a “Man of Affirmation”—an artist or intellectual who
tells the Leadership Community exactly what it wants to
hear. One can only speculate as to how Time would rank a
Veblen or a Dewey, a Twain or a Mencken, were such ﬁgures
to appear today.

Periodically, Time publishes the ﬁndings of its massive
(in breadth rather than depth) investigations of American
life. In its thirtieth anniversary issue, Time chose as its
victim the American intellectual, whom it accused, arraign-
ed, and promptly convicted as a Gnostic conspirator. Last
year Time dared to suggest that a moral relativism might
underlie the sexual mores of the American college student
(it should be mentioned, to the magazine's everlasting credit,
that it did not retreat a single step when deluged with angry
letters from Good Christians and Patriotic Americans).

FOR THE BENEFIT of the Leadership Community-
and for those who aspire to membership——'I‘ime (Dec. 4,
1964) included a 15-page feature story on the “New Ele-
gants,” an article which assured its readers that being
nouveau riche is (no longer unacceptable) in American high
society.

In its Dec. 18 issue, Dorothy “Buff” Chandler appeared
on the cover. Mrs. Chandler is one of the leading matrons
of mass culture on the West Coast and is the wife of Nor-
man “Los Angeles Times” Chandler. It is coincidental that

the Henry Luces and-the Norman Chandlers are the closest -

of friends. _
Although it is rumored that there is a computer-like
“pun machine” in the basement of the Time-Life Building

' in New York City, it must be conceded that Time employs

many gifted writers. But Time remains a magazine more
devoted to entertainment and humor than to the accurate
presentation and analysis of the news.

1) SG should be the only stu-
dent organization to ‘speak in the
name of and make decisions for
the entire student body. The
proper function of a group such
as the Student Affairs Commit-
tee is to advise. Decision-making,
however, is the legitimate power
of SG.

2) The Book Center should be
converted into a University Co-
operative (such as now exists at
such schools as Cornell, Harvard,
and Princeton), The members of
the cooperative would be charged
a very nominal fee (it is $1 at
the above schools) for one year
membership and would receive a
rebate (which usually amounts to
10 per cent or better) at the end
of each trimester. ,

3) A student committee re-
cruited and chaired by a SG sena-
tor, should publish annually a
frank _and mature evaluation of
all undergraduate courses.

4) Library hours should be lib-
eralized and a head librarian
should be appointed immediate-
ly to facilitate a consistent and
qualitative library system.

5) A deﬁnite and constant sys-
tem of social visiting hours should
be established in men and wom-
en’s residence halls and in fra-
ternity houses and sorority suites

Also, students should not be
restricted to taking ﬁve particu-

as being needed in this area.

7) Commuter students should
be aided in their problems by

other area schools, work with
the Port Authority Transit Com-

Hoopsters Traveling;

By FRANK SMIZIK
The basketball team will again play the role of goodwill

- ambassadors when they travel to Washington, D.C. tomor-

row. The Panthers have given the crowds which see them
on the road a good reason to like the hoopsters since they
never embarass the home team by winning the games.

The same thing will be in the mind of the Washington
fans when the Panthers meet George Washington. George
Washington doesn't have too strong a squad and the Pan-

Gym Fault

The gymnastics team will
be relying on depth, its maj-
or handicap in every meet
thus far, to beat West Vir-
ginia at 2 p.m. tomorrow at
the field house.

The Mountaineers have placed
the gymnasts in this situation by
possessing one of the top per-~
formers in the county — Jerry
Spencer— and yet lacking any
support to back him up. Insur-
ing'his national rating, Spencer
took ﬁrst place in ﬁve events
against Slippery Rock last week.

“Spencer is deﬁnitely the guy
to watch,” said coach Warren
Neiger. “We’re conceding almost
30 points to him and its going to
take a pretty good effort to over-
come that.”

is banking on winning every sec-
ond and third and perhaps a few
firsts. A break through could
come with Dave Mcliinnis in the
ﬂoor exercises. and Tom Mimge
on the high bar.

“McKinnis and Misage could
both beat Spencer if they have
a really good day,” added Neiger.
“Misage has been looking his best
on the high bar. Health and in-
jury wise we're pretty well off.
We'll just be keeping our ﬁngers
crossed.”

In tomororw’s meet there will
be no trampoline or all-around
competition. The Mountaineers
have not yet converted over from
Olympic rules to the NCCA rules

_ but will do so next year. A tram-

oline exhibition will be given

though.

up their morale.

Except for defeating Massa-
chusetts and Westminister, the
Panthers have not won on the
road. They have lost nine games
on the oppositions court includ-
ing two in the Quaker City Tour-
nament,

They’ve been much less kind
to the very few fans who make
it to the home games, however.
The hoopsters have won three
games out of ﬁve on home court,
counting the Steel Bowl.

The Panthers were less anxious
to be hospitable to the Philadel-
phia fans for the third time on
Tuesday against Temple. They
me already lost to Wichita and
Penn in games at the Palestra
and they made the Owls worry
before they succumbed by six
points.

Daryle Ruby and Bob Lovett
tried their best not to oblige the
home fans and scored 20 and 18
points, respectively. Ruby has
been hitting consistently for the
last few" games and has brought
his scoring average to almost 15

Lehigh Tomorrow

By BILL CABIN

The 130-pound match between Mike Johnson and Le-
high’s undefeated sophomore Joe Peritore highlights the
wrestling team’s meet tomorrow at Lehigh.

Reigning Eastern champion Johnson challenges Peri-
tore’s eight match winning streak. Johnson was undefeated
last year, but a knee injury has hampered him this year,
giving him a 4-1 record. He did not wrestle last week at
Cornell because of a mild case of the flu.

Peritore, a native of Warren-
dale, Ohio, unseated letterman
John Leek early in the season
and has compiled an 8-0 against
such wrestling powers as Iowa
State, Penn State, and Navy. He
won the 130-pound title at the
Freshman Plebe Tournament last
year.

Peritore is only one of seven
sophomores who have given
depth to the Engineer’s seven re-
turning lettermen. As freshmen
last year, they compiled an unde-
feated dual-meet record, winning
three titles and two rimner-up
positions in the Plebe Tourna-
ment.

Sophomores Bob Hartenstine,
Mike Caruso, and Glenn Ams-
baugh have all replaced letter-
men in starting positions. Caruso
holds a 7-0 record, and meets
Torn Heniﬁ (6-1) in the 123-
pound match. Caruso was the
outstanding wrestler in the 1964
Plebe Tournament,

Tom Baily has won his last
four matches, but faces Harten-
stine in the 157-pound match.
Hartenstine has a 5-3 record, and
has pinned three opponents in
his ﬁrst varsity season.

Dino Boni moves to the 147-
nound class this week to face
either Amsbaugh or sophomore
Len Gyllenhall who have been
alternating in the 147-pound di-
vision, and have 3-3-1 composite
records. ~ 1

Although the Engineer’s line-
up is sophomore-dominated, sen-
iors Harley Ferguson and John
Illgenwarth and junior Bill Stuart

are among the team’s top six
wrestlers. Captain Ferguson
placed second in the 157-pound
division of the 1964 Easterns, and
has a 5-2-1 record, as a 167-
pounder this year.

Illgenwarth poses an insur-
mountable threat to the matmen’s
depleted heavyweight division.
Bill Bodle will wrestle Illegen-

warth, who placed third at the ~

EIWA tournament and has scored
12 falls in his last 20 matches.

Frankalkun, the team’s second
leading point man with a 7-1
record, faces Stuart. Stuart, how-
ever, posts an 8-0 record and
was runner-up to Johnson in the
1964 Easterns.

Although the matmen won the
dual-meet, 19-13, last year, Le-
high edged them by one point to
win the Eastern team champion-
ship. Chances of winning tomor-
row’s meet appear slim since the
Engineer’s are “just as strong or

stronger than last year,” accord-
ing to coach Gerry Leeman.

The wrestlers are weaker. than
last year and have less depth
than Lehigh. They lost to Cor-
nell, 21-11, last week and lost to
Syracuse, 23-11, earlier. Lehigh,
however, trounced Cornell, 28-5,
and beat Syriicuse, 29-6.

Track Team Ends Indoor Season

By RON SHEARER

The track team ended its
indoor season on a losing
note at Navy last Saturday,
as their season mark slipped
to the .500, 2-2.

“The season did not turn
out exactly as we wanted it,”
said Coach Carl Rees. “We ex-
pected some of our sophomores
and men we thought would score
seconds or thirds to come through.
They just didn’t.”

Injuries to Fran Shor, Larry
Hubner, and Don Hinchberger
hurt the depth of the squad. “We
missed Don Hinchberger the most
for the 1,000-yard run,” said
Rees. “Two of the three times we

' lost this event, Hinchberger would

have won. He had beaten the
winners last year in the same
event.”

“I thought We had a good
chance to beat Army here at the
Field House,” said Rees," but we
inst didn't pull it oﬂ. Kent State
and Slippery Rock were pretty

* much as we expected them, al-

though Kent’ best mnner was
injured and made it easier for us.

next to impossible,” continued
Rees. “They just have too many
bodies for a. squad like ours.”
Rees feels that the team could
have done better than its show-
ings. “Any time you lose, you
could have done better,” he said.

Coach Rees will be the ﬁrst to
admit that the season had its
highlights, too. “I think the ad-
justment of Bill DelVecchio from
a dash man to the 600-yard run
was the brightest spot of the sea-
son,” said Rees. “Most men would
quit the squad if they were .as
good as Bill in the dash and their
coach asked them to change
events.

“Luddy Hayden was another
consistent point scorer,” said
Rees. “Any time a performer can
compete in several events and
score consistently, as Hayden did,
he is a valuable asset to a team.”

Coach Rees also had praise for
shot putter Jim Flanigan, two-
miler Dave Eichenlaub, mile and
two mile runner Damien Koch
who had execellent seasons, Dave
Sallach did not do as well in the
high jump as expected, but he
hurt his back in the Kent State
meet and could not go all out in

Most members of the track
team are ﬁnished now until the
outdoor season begins in April.
The exception is the mile relay
team which was invited to the
Baltimore Invitational on Feb. 27
and will go to New York for the
IC4A meet on March 6.

The swimming team faces
Bucknell University tomor-

Ben Grady anticipates an-

Looking at the Bison’s times
and places earned in the NCAA
swimming and diving tournament
last year, Grady said, “We may
see some pool records broken

because they are very ﬁne swim-

mers.”

Bucknell coach Bob Latour de- I

account for 80 per cent of the
