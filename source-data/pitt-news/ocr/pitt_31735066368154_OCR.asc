Asdourian Resigns

Charged With Jeopardizing Fairness

Student Government Board can-
didate Arpi Asdourian, charged
with jeopardizing the fairness of
the election after ballots were
stolen from a Hillman Library pol-
ling place, resigned from the race
yesterday, Student Government
Board president Todd DeLuca said
last night.

DeLuca said Asdourian cited
personal reasons for her resigna-
tion. She was unavailable for com-
ment last night. The Student
Government Elections Committee
dropped the charges against
Asdourian because of the resigna-
tion, DeLuc:a said.

According to DeLuca, two stu-
dents reported to the board and the
Office of Student Activities that
they saw someone stealing about 25
ballots from an unattended polling
placein the library on Wednesday;

Joyce Giancarlo, assistant direc-

tor of student activities, said
Asdourian, though not charged
with stealing the ballots, “knew
about it and was seen with them
(the ballots).”

A student admitted to stealing
the ballots, and they were returned
to the Office of Student Activities
Wednesday night, Giancarlo said.
Neither she nor DeLuca would
comment on whether the ballots
had been marked.

The elections committee did not
hold a hearing on the complaint
because Asdourian resigned, elec-
tions chairman Mauina Simon
said.

The library polling place was
left unattended Wednesday for
about 10 inintites while election
committee workers were changing
shifts. Both have been fired, DeLu-
ca said.

Mark Downs defeated
Spencer Davis by over 250
votes to become Pitt’s new
Student Government Board
president, according to the
unofficial election results
announced last night.

Downs, considered an
underdog by some because
he had no previous student
government experience,
nevertheless drew 1,697 votes
to Davis’ 1,444. Davis is a
current board member.

Junior Jeff Shaffer was the
top vote-getter among the
board candidates with 1,059
votes. Other board winners,
in order, are: Jeff Delmon-
tagne, who will now serve a
second term as a board
member with 1040; Mark
Steele, a junior engineer,
922; Kathy Brown, the only
female elected to the board,

G_reene 862; Dan Lecce, the

 only non-Greek elected, 856;

‘ sophomore Ken Stram, 804;
and sophomore Craig Mur-

I phey, 780.

_ "The results are considered

‘ unofficial until the Office of

Student Activities verifies

leach candidate's financial
 report.

Downs said he is not sur-
prised by his win.
‘.“I really worked hard for

‘f it,” he said. “I think it was
it because of my enthusiasm
and hard work. They were
_the things that carried me.”

Students Trying To Increase AwayGame Tickets

By MARK A. SINDLER

Because of student complaints
that not enough l1(l~'.ClS for the Pitt-
Penn State gaine were 21\'illl'dl)l(‘
this year, Student (;()\'t‘I‘t1tl1t‘l1l
Board president 'lodd DeLuca is
forining a coalition oi students
from all Pitt canipuses to obtain ‘st
larger student ticket allotment for
away games.

Pitt gets 5,000 ticl<etsfor each
away game. Five hundred of these
are earmarked for students; 108 go
to branch campuses. 92 to the Pitt
Program Council and 300 for the
general student population.

 

DeI.uca said the student coali-
tion will present a proposal at the

Uriiversity Athletic Committee
rneeting Nov. 17 that would
increase the student allotment

from H) to 20 percent for awa§.‘
game tickets.

“SOB has realized the problem
of away games that we regionally
schedule with such s(‘h()()ls as Penn
State and West Virginia," !”)el.uca
said. “VVe have plans to take action
by going to the University Athletic
(lommittee for a larger percentage
of the seats."

The University Athletic Com-
mittee consists of two students

appointed by student government;
one student appointed by the Col-
lege of General Studies and nine
faculty and community representa-
tives. '
l7niversity Athletic friﬂlnttlllltt‘
member David Sopko, a student
government appointee, said the
te:iin’s potential this year has
increased interest in a larger stu-
dent ticket allotment.
"No one ever really
before," Sopko said. “The problem
occurs when Pitt plays schools like
Peini State or WVU...besides, Pitt
has a chance to be the national
champion this year. In the past,

cared’

there have been teams with no hope
of being a national champion.”
Athletic director Ed Bo/.ik
refused to comment on the pro-
posal. Asked whether the students‘
proposal might be accepted by the
University Athletic (Iommittee, he
said, “that's a hypothetical ques-
tion." He said he was unaware of

student problems in obtaining
tickets.
DeLuca, however, said he spoke

with Bozik about the tickets. De-
Luca did not want to give details
about the coalition’s plans
because, he said, “Bozik’s a smart
man. He'll know how to beat us.”

Assessing the Student Government Board  

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

The days of the campus
government revolutionary have
all but disappeared from most
universities around the coiin—
try. The war in Vietnam is over
an(l the draft, while existent, is
not a major factor of revolt as it
was in the ‘60s.

Life on college campuses in
1982 is seemingly serene.
There’s nothing to protest
against and the feelings of
animosity between students and
administrators have turned into
a tolerance of sorts.

Because of these changing
times, student governments
have also gone through
changes. This week’s Forum
deals with the topic: does stu-
dent government at Pitt have
any influence -witliiii the
university?

Most of the students iiiter-
viewed around campus and in
the Towers Lobby were not
even sure what SGB actually
does, let alone if it has any

power.
“I don’t know anything
about them," one student said.
“The only thing I know is that
election time is near because
they keep shoving everything
(posters, etc.) in your face.”
(Iarol Ferchak, a junior, said
she really doesn't know what

SGB does, btit she thinks it
probably has some influence
with the administration.

“If the adiiiiiiistratioiii is
dead set against something, I
don't think SGB can turn it
around," she said.

Although the changing times
could be used as an excuse for
iioii-productivity, the student
governments at Penn State" and
West Virginia University have
not found th_is to be true.

Ann Conners, the editorial
page editor of the Daily Colle-
gian at PSU, said the ainountof
work that is accoiiipiislied by
the student government
depends on the leader.

The Illilkt‘-11]) of l’SU‘s
Undergraduate Student
Coveriiment is a president and
a senate, which consists of 35
students elected campiis-wide.

Conners said, like Pitt's, their
student government's main job
is to allocate money. Other
things, however, are done.

She said last year's president,
whom she called a “strong
leader,” was instrumental in
starting ‘it strong campaign
against the cuts in student aid.

“That campaign made a dif— '

ference," she said. “Penn State
is one of the leaders in fighting
cuts."

ARGENTINA AFTER THE FALKLANDS WAR .

Tim Rowland, associate edi-
tor of the Daily Anthenum, said
WVU's student governinent’s
power is limited l)ut it is able to
do some things.

“Their primary function is to
act as a liaison between the stu-
dents aiid the faculty," Row-
land said. “But they go down to
the state capital a lot and push
for several bills."

WVU’s student government
was also able to stop the adiniii-
istration from changing the
add/drop period from 10 weeks
to five weeks after each term
begins.

Rowland said the govern-
ment board caii make a differ-
ence with the administration in
borderline cases but if the
administration has its mind set,
there’s nothing to stop the poli-
cies’ from being enacted.

Pitt's director of Student
Activities. Andy Smith, said
SOB does have some influence.

Smith said that during the
turbulence of the '60s, the board
decided to work around the sys-
tem rather than within it, as it
does now.

“The approach they chose
was a little bit coiifrontationist
to a point,” he said.

This approach did not
appeal to the administration,
he said. The way the board
works now is more appreciated
by the administration.

“If people perceive student
government as acting in a
responsible and responsive
nature, they are going to act
more positively towards it,”
Smith said.

Clreationists Spread Misconceptions, Prof Says

By MARK.A. SINDLER

Crea'tio_nist_s, who believe that all
species‘ on earth were created by
higher beings, are spreading inis-
conceptioiis about evolutionary
theory in order to abolish it, history
and philosophy of science profes-
sor james-Lennox said Wednesday.

Speaking at the University
HonorsjProgram Student
Cabin'et’s5_Noontime Lecture Ser-
ies, Lennox said that creationists
are rhetorically clever, well-
organized, and have convinced
IlTTIII()IlS that evolutionary theory
is illegitimate.

The creationists, Lennox said,

are strongly connected to the Moral-

Majority, have strong television
exposure and use the mailing lists
of several influential conservative
groups.

He said he is concerned about
their tactics because of the “gross
caricatures” they form when out-
lining evolutionary theory. Crea-
tionists win over many “neutral
people" by not setting the terms
straight and have serious effects on
people still undecided about the
whole issue, he said.

Lennox added that creationists

have established a trend under
which one who accepts evolution-
ary theory is labelled immoral.
“The attack is clearly religiously
and morally motivated," Lennox
said. “Being an evolutioiiist in
creationists’ eyes means you are a
Fascist, Communist, Nazi, a racist.
Their attack is based on a strong
dose of moral fervor.”
“Creationists can easily switch
topics when they are on the defen-
sive to being on the offensive. They
think they are defending the mor-
als of society. Instead, it could lead
to a serious erosion of society's

moral fibers," he said.

In addition, Lennox said that
creationists have much influence
over textbook publishers and are
trying to demand that creationist
and eyolutioiiary theory be taught
in school.

“They want their text taught
consistent with religious view-
points.” Lennox said. “This
clearly violates the First and 14th
Aminendinents. though. These
state, simply, that you cannot

‘enhance or detract from religoii

and in the public classroom."

‘\
The American Civil Liberties‘)

Union successfully quelled the

creationists’ attempt in Arkansas,

Leiinox said, but there are still
cuts, countersuits and jockeying
for position in Louisiana.
“(Ireationists are out to insure
that the public school ciirric-ultiin
reflects their beliefs," Lennox said.
“They plan their strategy so the
publishers react by taking evolu-
tion out of biology textbooks.”
“After a revision in 1963 of the
public school curriculum," Len-
nox coininented. “livoliitionary

biology was made a major part of

but changed in the early '70s after
an anti-evolutioiiary moyeineiit
was afoot."

The publishers are, in effect,
‘squee/.ed" by creatioiiists to water
down evoltitionary theory. I.(‘l1I1()X
said. If they do not conform, the
publishers do not sell books.

These publishers, Leiiiiox con-
tinued, consistently worry whether
they will offend people at the grass-
roots level.

Opinion

 

In Our Best  
Interests

Legislation calling for the elimination of
a mandatory retirement age is meeting
opposition from the academic
community—and for good reason.

The legislation, proposed by Senator
John Heinz will allow members of the uni-
versity faculty to continue working past 70,
a move that Pitt and other universities
argue would have an adverse affect on
tenure’.

This elimination of a mandatory retire-
ment age would back up the system by cur-
tailing the number of job openings.
Potential faculty are unlikely to enter teach-
ing careers if there are fewer positions

available.

Coupled with this is the fact that Pitt’s
senior administrators support a controver-
sial policy. Briefly stated, the policy main-

L tains that the proportion of tenured faculty
must not rise to a level that would exceed
the amount of funds or number of positions
available.

The most current legislation concerning
the mandatory retirement age expired last
June. It had also called for an elimination
but it exempted universities. The removal
of this exemption under the new legislation
(S2617) works against the best interest of the
students, according to Lou Tronzo, assist-
ant vice-chancellor for public affairs. He
said that students will not be exposed to the
new ideas and research that the newer
faculty could provide.

/ Universities are suffering from a lack_of
trained professionals and those potential
professors are not immune to the forces of
the marketplace. In creating an atmosphere
that would attract more of them, Tronzo
explained that the first step is to make cer-
tain there are job openings—something
that S2617 would reduce.

Granted, the legislation was proposed to
amend the current age discriminations, but
a compromise should be reached that
doesn’t adversely affect the students or the

faculty.

Turning Back Progress

By TOM WA_NKO

The concept of education as the
great equalizer is being abandoned

, throughout America, and few stu-

dents seem to notice. Fewer seem to
care. Students need to take a look at
the programs being enacted at the
local, state and federal level. The
Reagan Administration, Governor
Thornburgh and Chancellor Pos-
var are carrying out programs that
will succeed in accomplishing
nothing less than putting higher
education out of the reach of lower
and middle income students. They
are engaged in an effort to turn the
clock back on the social progress
that has been made over the past
several decades. In light of this, it
appears as if only a small number
of students realize where they
should stand.

Are you a student with a PHEAA
guaranteed loan? If so, Reagan has
seen to it that you now “pay" a 5
percent origination fee on your
loan before you receive it. Over a
four year period, you will relin-
quish close to six hundred dollars
to the banks and be expected to
“pay” that six hundred back at 9
percent interest (until it rises to
expected levels of 12 or 14 percent)
when you graduate, never deriving
the benefits of using this “fee.” If
you currently receive a PELL
grant, chances are you could be one
of the 750,000 students out of2 mil-
lion who will be adversely affected
by the “failure" of the Reagan
administration to increase the
PELI. grant budget to keep up
with inflation. Next year, under
the proposed Reagan budget, the
Pl{LI.. grant program will be cut by
over $800 million. If you are on a
work—study program, you can look
forward to cuts of close to $lO0 mil-
lion. If that’s not enough, how
about the elimination of National
Direct Student Loans, Supplemen-
tal Educational Opportunity
Grants and‘State Student Incentive
Grants, a slashing of $523.1
million.

Soine.might say that under Rea-
gan's New Federalism, the states
will be picking up the “burden" of
assisting students. No way. Thanks
to Thornburgh, Pennsylvania has
the highest tuition rate for public
schools in the entire nation. Will
the university cut us a break?
Hardly, tuition here at Pitt has
been raised during 12 out of the last
I3 years consecutively, and the
chancellorsmiles all the way to the
bank. All the while, not even a
wliiinper of opposition is voiced by
any student government. Student
government is, in my view, sup-
posed to be the representative of
ziiidnegotiator f0f.».Slud('l1I needs,

not a rubber stamp for administra-
tion screw policies.

Thomas jefferson wrote, “livery
government degenerates when
trusted to the rulers of the people
alone. The people themselves
therefore, are its only safe deposito-
ries. And to render them safe, their
minds must be improved to a cer-
tain degree.”

It has taken close to 200 years to
make advances towards realizing
this great goal. Most of these
advances have taken place in the
post-World’ War II era, a most

‘Thanks to Thornburgh,
Pennsylvania has the
highest tuition rate for
public schools in the
entire nation.’

recent phenomenon in historical
context. I

Consider that the G.I. Bill was
the first program to provide a vehi-
cle to higher education for main-
stream lower and middle class
Americans returning home from
war. The next major advance in
educational opportunities for
mainstream Americans took place
with the passage of the Higher
Education Act of I965. This act
sought to make higher education
possible for the children of lower
and middle income families. This
bill “authorized the first program
to provide general grants to under-
graduate college students and was
enacted in concert with loan and
work—stu'dy programs." In recent
years, minorities and women have
been able to derive benefits from
the enactment of these and similar
programs.

Now, these programs are being
compromised by the current “rul-
ers." What America faces in the '80s
is nothing less than a return to the
elitist—type system present at the

turn of the century. In 1900. only Al"

percent of the 17-22 year age group
was attending college. By the '70s,
this figure had risen to almost 50
percent. Without student aid and
services, the majority of main-
stream Americans wishing to
attetid college will be closed out by
financial barriers and left in an
educational void, thereby reserving
the “right" to higher education for
the wealthy.

I, for one, don't feel our children
should have to be faced with the
prospect of only having a choice
b%‘l“'<it‘,u..905-!stm.2I.ct>imIisinits;gql,-.

lege or attending a vocational
school, but these are the implica-
tions of cuts in student aid and
services.

Consider the statements by Rea-
gan’s Secretary of Education, Bell,
“I don’t think we’re going to be as
concerned with social reform and
equal opportunity in education as
with the survival of our system in a
very, very competitive world. The
U.S. is no longer going to be as
dominant a power in the world’s
sphere as it has been in the past,
and it's not going to be the demo-
cratic issues that are going to keep
us on the edge of our seats....We
have to educate for technology, for
managing scarcity and for coinpe=
tition and productivity.” I think
we can imagine an outraged and
affronted Jefferson listening to
such aiiti-democratic remarks by a
representative‘ of the American
government. A

An Oxford professor was quoted
in the Feb.  I978 issue of News-
week as sayin'g,“If you work hard
and intelligently, you should be
able to detect when a man is talking

rot, and that, in my view, is the 

97

purpose of education.

Without programs to assure the
opportunity to attend schools of
higher education, you may be the
last generation with the ability to
recognize the rot that is spewing
forth from the Reagans, Thorn-
burghs and Posvars.

Consider where you stand, Pitt
students, and take a stand. If we fail
to "struggle against these static and
regressive policies, their momeii—
tum will overpower our attempts
to continue progress.

Degrading Our Quarterback

Dear Editor:

I know that Dan Marino is one of

the better known. students on
campus, if not the most well
known. He is probably better

known than the majority of the
faculty members,-even the
provost—and, of course, we all
know who (or what)‘ou'r provost is,
don't we?! It is also true that
Marino’s fame, or should I say
name, has been -‘established
through Pitt’s football ‘program.
Furthermore, it is safe to_say that he
has not performed aswell this year
as he has in previous Ybars, but...

0 He is our quarterback and one
of the captains of our team. He may
not be the team, but without his
contributions, we may not have
come this far. It’s truethat thereare
a lot of other good quarterbacks in
college football, but. how many are
better than, or even ajsugood as, Dan
Marino? ‘ ~' -

0 Does the factjjthat he’s not
having as great a season‘ this year as
compared to last year's (and no
one, not even UPI, can say last year
was bad!) justify the excessive
number of Pitt -_N_'eu'2s articles
degrading our quarterback?
(There’s that word again-our.)

Sure, it’s a newspaper's job to
carry both sides of _an issue or to
simply tell it like it is’,,bu'tcriticism
has its limits. When two or more
articles against Marino appear,
there is definitely _ something
wrong with the spirit at The Pitt
News. . '

I know that it must be extremely
difficult to cover enough college
sports to fill the entire section, but
“Dan Marino is Washed Up”
stories are being run too many
times. Who do you’ think you are

anyway, Sports Illustrated? Well,
spare us. You are, however, our
school newspaper, and that is
nothing to scoff about.

0 What gives the student body
just cause to boo Marino during
the football game—continuously?!
Even Terry Bradshaw has, at times,
not performed all that well, and he
has led the Steelers to four Super
Bowl championships. Maybe
when it comes to college
quarterbacks, you prefer Penn
State’s boy-next-door, Todd
Blackledge.

Penn State is not even
undefeated, but excuse me, he’s
having a good year, so we’ll cheer
for them this season—is that how it
goes? I’ve been told that
“Pittsburgh loves a winner, but
hates a loser.” Wake up you guys,
haven’t you heard, we’re still
winningll

0 Is it always Marino’s fault? I
guess the receivers never run the
wrong patterns, drop perfect

News Staff Asked

Dear Editor: ~ - '

I would like to condemn the staff
of The Pitt News for printing a
column entitled “For What It’s
Worth” by Christina Clinton on
‘Monday Oct. 18, 1982. '

I would especially like ‘to cite
reponsible for this .errroneous bit
of journalism. They*a_r.e_managing

editor and columnist, Christina
Clinton; editor, Mary Kane; and
copy editor, Jim Shaughnessy.

I would like to start with
Christina Clinton. In her haste to
produce a column of;worth and
respectable integrity; Clinton
forgot several things. First of all,
according to Melvin Mencher,
author of “News Reporting and
Writing,” a column is defined as a
“signed article of opinion or strong
personal expression,-frequently by
an authority for expert.” Would an
authority or expert make the kind
of incomprehensibleerrors made

Dear Editor:

As members of the Ukrainian
Student Organizaton at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, We are
pleased to witness an uY_1Pr€C9'
dented proclamation honoring the
Ukrainian Helsinki Group bi’
President Reagan. The proclama-
tion acknowledges the impOrtanC€
of the human rights activists work
in Ukraine. Today, most of the
members of the group are 1mP“‘
soned or exiled under the all
encompassing charge of arm-

by Clinton and so diligently
pointed out by many of The Pitt
News readers?

Second, Christina Clinton failed
to follow the most important and
most basic rule of journalism—she
failed to check her facts and instead
relied on a “misinformed source.”
In her last paragraph she wrote,
“Roger Daltrey, Hall and Oates
and Billy Joel will never see this
column.” Let’s hope that they
don’t, because if they do, Clinton
and The Pitt News could be
charged with libeljand no'judge or
jury in America would decide in
favor of Clinton or The Pitt News.

The third point that needs to be
made is that in Clinton’s article on
Friday, Oct. 22, she took a
nonchalant and even sarcastic view
of her mistakes.

Instead of apologizing to her
readers, she insulted “college
students’ intelligence” because we
responded to her article of

The Ukrainian Helsinki Group
was organized in 1976 for the pur-
pose of monitoring the Soviet
Union’s compliance with the Hel-
sinki Accords. The Helsinki
Accords, an international agree-
ment signed in Finland in 1975 by
thirty-five states including the
USSR, guarantees the observance
of human rights to the citizens of
the signatory states.

President Reagan signed the
proclamation on Sept. 21, 1982 in
accordane with House Concurrent
Resolution 205. This resolution
also sets aside Nov. 9 to mark the

si*xth'anniversa~ry of the gI0u‘p.’Th“t"

passes, and the coaches never, ever,
call bad plays, right? Like I said,
everyone makes mistakes.

0 Have you ever stood in the
middle of Pitt stadium and looked
up at the bleachers? Well, take the
opportunity someday. lmagiiie
those stands filled with 40,000
sometimes screaming fans (and I
use that term looselyl). Now,
imagine these words coming from
these loyal (?) fellow Panthers: You
messed up! You’re on drugs!

Pitt’s football program is one of
the best in the country. What gives
us the right to criticize something
we know nothing about? Do any of
us really know what goes on down
there on the playing field, or even
on the practice field, for that
matter? I’m sure that Dan Marino
doesn’t need some bumbling
underclassman to defend him, in
fact he could probably do a better

job himself. But why should he '

need to defend himself to us?

If you think he stinks and you
could do a better job, let's see you
try. Just ask Foge how many
people try out for his posi tion-—it’s
not as easy to compete against the
best as it is to compete against
someone who’s merely average. Is
it?

One last thought—it has to be
true that it’s lonely at the top.
Given the opportunity, I wouldn’t
trade places with you. Good luck
on Saturday, Dan. Whether we win
by 30 points or by one, or even if we

lose, as long as you and the team 

give it your best shot, that’s all we
can ask for. And all we should
expect.

To Resign

incompetence.

I would also like to condemn
Mary Kane for allowing Christina
Clinton’s article to be published.
Jim Shaughnessy is also to blame
because it is his job to find and
correct any errors that are made
before an article goes to print. If he
is suspicious about some facts, then
it is his job to send it back to the
writer for the necessary revisions.

I would like to close by asking
Christina Clinton to write a
sincere, apologetic response to her
column. If this can not be done,
then I hereby ask Christina Clinton
to resign as managing editor and
columnist for The Pitt News. We,
the “intelligent college students”
of the University of Pittsburgh,
will not be subjected to the
intolerable scribble that Christina"
Clinton calls journalism.

Dear Editor:

This letter is in response to
“Pork Chops, End Tables and
juniors Pants,” a letter relat-
ing to an article written by
Christina Clinton for The, Pitt
News on Oct. 18 entitled, “For
What It Is Worth.” Peter]. Bon-
acuse made one point about the
article in his letter. “The point
...is that we can’t take things so
seriously. Music is meant to be
entertainment and is there
sokly for our enjoyment.”

What was the rest of the arti-
cle? It was filled with immature
namecalling and sexist remarks
that were uncalled for. Instead
of addressing the issue that
Clinton was writing about,
Bonacuse chose to single out
the author and verbally abuse
her.

SexistRemarks Do Not

Address The Real Issue

’'had a point by saying that rock

Yes, Clinton did incorrectly
state some facts, and there’s
absolutely no excuse for a
reporter not to get the facts
straight for a story. But again
Bonacuse chose to dwell on her
errors and cheated his reading
audience out of knowing why
he disagreed with the article. At
one point in his article, Bona-
cuse said Clinton’s article
“...started out being a sound
idea...” He tried to tell us why
the idea wasn't any good but
didn’t mention anything but
the misquotes. What was the
“sound idea” Bonacuse referred
to? Was he saying that Clinton

and role is sexist?

Having AGood Time

Dear Editor:

I just read Christina Clinton's
article, “This Bud's For You,” in
Wednesday's Pitt News. I am not
writing to abuse Christina Clinton
in any way, but to respond to an
attitude that the majority of college
students seem to hold—the attitude
that you must drink to have a good
time and that you can’t possibly
have a good time without alcohol.

I do no drink. Whereas some
people ask, “How can you have a
good time when you’re not drink-
ing?” I ask, “How can you have a
good time when you are drunk?” I
have attended many genuinely fun
parties at which not a drop of alco-
hol has been served. I think there is
something drastically wrong with
the attitude that you have to drink
to have fun. I listen to many peo-
ple, especially after a weekend of
intensive partying, brag about how
drunk they got and what ridiculous
things they thought they did—-
actually, they could not really
remember what happened after
about ll p.m.—-or how sick they
got afterward.

I just do not understand what is
so fun about that. Maybe someone
could tell me??? But I don't see how
people can say what a great party it
was or what a good time they had
when they don't remember what
they did or how sick they were.

Every once in a while, I turn my
thoughts to a somewhat serious
side. What about alcoholism?
Could any of these happy-go-lucky

partiers be alcoholics? Or will they
be? I would bet thatjustaboutever-
yone would say no—never! But I’m
not so sure.

I remember in a class last year
reading that if you have gotten so
drunk that you passed out more
than once or couldn’t remember
Wiiéii i/8b‘ {lit-l While? ﬁflﬂléliié; i/8h‘
could be an alcoholic. How many
college students fit into that cate-
gory? If that information is right, I
would think an awful lot do. That
is sad, because all anyone wants to
do is have a good time.

. Maybe tha_t is the problem. Hav-
ing a good time may mean getting
wasted——you know the way people
say, “Oh, did I ever have a great
time last night!"—with a certain
sparkle in their eyes. Maybe we
should think about what having a
good time means. '

I do not in any way condemn
drinking and I do not think ever-
yone should be a tee-totaller. Ijust
think there should be a happy
medium in how much people do
drink. A little more maturity and
discretion should be used in peo-
ple’s partying. The problem isn’t
just on college campuses. It is also
a part of high school and “adult”
life. It is a problem—-of both atti-
tudes and physical health!

Typical. There's no other
word to describe this piece of
”literature.” The story, which
(of course) revolves around a
torrid love affair, is about the
beautiful Celia Bartlett and the
virile Rafe Lattimore. They are
passionately in love, but Celia,
being the pure, good Southern
girl, refuses to give herself
totally to her would-be lover,
Rafe. He, being the noble gen-
tleman, strives to raise himself
to a position of wealth (since
being the second-born son he is
not entitled to the Lattimore
inheritance) before he'll ask for
Celia’s hand in marriage. How-
ever, Rafe’s brother Micah
spoils the plans when he bru-
tally rapes Celia after she jilts
him.

for a prolonged visit with an
aunt, leaving her lover and
father wondering at her sudden
and unexplained departure.

Unfortunately, she cannot con- _

fide in her father because he has
a heart condition, and the news
would kill him. Once she is safe
in Boston, Celia gets reac-
quainted with her cousin
Anthony, who finds out her
shameful secret.

At this time, the Civil War
breaks out between the North
and the South, and Cousin
Anthony, knowing Celia’s bit-
ter resentment and disappoint-
ment over her shattered future,
persuades her to turn spy
against the South. Celia agrees
to the plan, and after her father
dies, she moves back to her
home in Vicksburg, where she
leads a double life-~prominent
society and espionage. During
her time of treachery, Rafe also

Author Christina Savage uses
their reunion as the basis for
what can only be described as
soft-core pornography with
something of~a romantic twist.
The descriptions. of the love
scenes are quite explicit.

As in most novels of this
caliber, the story has a happy
ending. Rafe and Celia find true
happiness with each other, des-
pite the fact that Celia betrayed
her birthplace.

The Tempest is definitely one of
those easy, mindless reading
books with a small portion of
American history interspersed
throughout the story. The plot
itself is weak, ridiculous and
totally unbelievable. However,
Christina Savage’s knowledge
of sex does seem to be accurate,
so I guessthat in itself could
make this book worthwhile.

By FRANK DIGIACOMO

Night is starting to fall as the bat-
tered van pulls up to the It's A Small
World Disco in East Liberty and
parks along the curb. As I fumble
vainly in the darkness to determine
the difference between the door han-

dle and the window lever, Hans, the

driver and keyboardist! guitarist for
Carsickness, locks up his side of the
van and heads for the apartment
door. Chris Koenigsberg, the bassist
for the band, who is sitting behind
me in the microbus, finally realizes
my ineptitude and reaches instinc-
tively for the handle, spilling me
onto the Penn Mall sidewalk.

cians alike—largely without the help
of this city's inhabitants. With the
release of their second album, Sharpen
Up For Duty (T.M.l.), Carsickness’
acceptance and popularity has
reached new levels in both national
and international markets. The
band's material has been favorably
reviewed in such music periodicals as
Trouser Press and Op Magazine. In addi-
tion, Carsickness has performed live
gigs at such trendsetting clubs as
N YC's Danceteria with, according to
the band, a very good reaction.

and a nucleus was_.formed. Chris
Koenigsberg and Hans then signed
on to form the first Carsickness prot-
otype which went onto record two
45's and the LP Shooting Above The Car-
hage before the last member of the
band, saxophonist Don Juan, was
added at a Christmas party during
the winter of '80 to complete,the
band's roster as it is known now. "At
that time, garage bands couldn't get
gigs in clubs," says Hans, "the
Banana was a disco, the Decade was
rock-n-roll...everybody had to play
parties, and you played until the
police came."

"We would rehearse in Soap’s liv-
ing room at the time, and there’d be a
lot of people hanging out with us,"
Sciulli adds. "Eventually, all of these
people started to form bands or were
already in them—sort of an under-

» ground movement was started."

However, although there was an
overabundance of bands formed, few
groups besides Carsickness have
remained intact let alone maintained
a steady production of new material
and music. Possibly, the band's work
ethic has something to do with this
statistic. Though Hans maintains
that the band did not form to "make
it," he does admit that each group

roots are in t»  -y, though the
group generally agrees that they are
no longer a part of the Pittsburgh
underground music scene. "We used
to be, but a lot of people have turned
against us," says Koenigsberg. Soap
attributes this to the feeling that
Carsickness is not considered to be a
punk or new wave band by the
people.

Certainly, trying to define Car-
sickness’ sound is by no means easy.
They've been described as the psy-
chedelic answer to The Clash and as
having a strong resemblance to the
Psychedelic Furs. Although the
group does not agree with either des-

    

cription and is especiallyinsulted by
the second, they refuse to pigeonhole
their brand of music. Soap refers to a
piece of graffiti: "On the bathroom
walls, some people call us the Steely
Dan of Pittsburgh—I guess they con-
sider it an insult."

The same clique that once
endorsed Carsickness now tends to

American ci=t== Youngstown,
Ohio; Olympia and Seattle,
Washington; as well as L.A. and
NYC. "It doesn't really upset us that
we can't get a decent gig here on a
Saturday night," says Soap, "because
we can always go to Canada where
they treat it like a major event."

"A lot of times we've sold out
tickets," adds Koenigsburg, "We
played Toronto and four local bands
opened for us...and we should be
worried about not getting a gig at the
Banana?" he laughs.

Nonetheless, the focus remains on
Pittsburgh's’ particularly dismal
music scene. Childers emphasizes
that, in addition to the fact that Pitts-
burgh is not on the rock club circuit
map, there is no place for little-
known bands to play around here.

In addition to the lack of night-
clubs and playing places, the band
recognizes that there are a lot of good
Pittsburgh bands that find them-
selves trapped in this city and enter-
ing various states of stagnation. "A
lot of bands in Pittsburgh have the
notion that if you can make it in
Pittsburgh, some one is going to
come in from L.A. or New York and
take you out of Pittsburgh. That hap-
pened to the Houserockers and they
still couldn't get out of this city.
They had a major label and a major
producer for their third album, and
now look where they are," says Hans,
"I noticed that with the Core, too. I
saw them the other night, and

tried to play out of town as much as
possible. We also try to get our

Soap also maintains that the band
is by no means stagnating. "Two
years ago, bands like the House-

that, at present, is working with
twelve bands. In exchange for $10.00
a month in dues, T.M.I. agrees to
send a band's new record out to the
record distributors with
which it is associated, in adition to
advertising for the bands. "T.M.I.
has a lot of good credibility with the
major American distributors we
work with,” says Soap. "The distrib-
utors know that the bands are good
and that the records will be delivered
if we say they will.”

At present, T.M.I. is working on a
compilation album that will offer a
sampling of the bands on the label.
The groups on the album will be The
Dancing Cigarettes from Blooming-
ton Indiana; Akron’s Johnny Clam-
ett and the Walkers; Club of Rome

probably a large part of bei
band, it is not the only reason ,
existence of Carsickness. Whe
fronted individually, each mem ‘
professed an extreme obsession with
music and the desire to play in a
band—~though the vibes from the
music scene at the ti_me didn't always
nurture that hunger. "I think in the
late '70s, we were intimidated by the
Eric Claptons and all those guys

ﬁecause we never thought we could

0 that good,” says Hans, "so even
though you always wanted to be in a
band, you shied away from it because
of the superstar image that was pre-
valent at the time." However, that
image changed as more and more

 
   
   
  
  
  
 
   
    
  
 

garage bands began to emerge as the

life-forces behind the new rock-n-
roll. With that new image came the
chance for a band like Carsickness to
exist, and that chance was seized
upon. Of course, along with that
opportunity came the sacrifices of
not being able to hold down a steady
job, extreme shortages of money and
the seemingly eternal task of looking
for low rent apartments that the
band could also practice in. As Hans
puts it, "The standard American
dream is not part of our dream."

Soap, on the other hand, doesn't
really see a problem. "It's not really a
sacrifice is it?" _he says. "The only
sacrifice is that when you're in a
band, time goes by so fast, and people
say, ‘Did you see that movie,’ or ‘did
you hear about that,’ and the answer
is always ’No,’ because you spend
most of your free time practicing
when you're not playing gigs. Then,
when there is a night off, you go and
get drunk."

"And we all sit around the bar
together and talk about playing and
music and everything we do
together," continues Childers, who
also tends to overlook. the sacrifices
in exchange for the excitement of
having a record come out or just the
entire learning process associated
with being a band that has cut two
LPs and three singles and has per-
formed over 250 live gigs.

No doubt, the band unanimously
admits that they have learned a lot
about the art of performing, record-
ing and music in general. "We're
more aware of what's going on now,"
says Koenigsberg. "After hearing
our records and hearing my own mis-
takes on the albums and seeing that
no one else catches them, I realize
that there's a lot more behind the
scenes in this business than is
evident." A

Yet, along with the education,
esha certain degree of disillusion-
mentflsut that is not too evident in
I I ix aces of this band. Steve Sci-
 5 a germ of this feeling, but
‘ imlt d to his outlook on other
3H finds that it's hard for him
ock show and really appre-
_ i nstead there is a tendency to
‘e’ hypercritical of everything the
_ ad-“does, he says. Hans, meanwhile,
IS the polar opposite in terms of his
feelings for the band. "Actually, I
think it gets more and more excit-
ing," he says. "The new album is out,
and it's doing really well. With
T.M.I., we've picked up a new dis-
tributor that's never handled us
before; we're getting better gigs—we
just played Danceteria in New York,
and we gained a lot of credibility out
of it. It just seems like there's so
many new possibilities that are
opening up that there's really no rea-
son to become disillusioned."

Yes, to listen to the members of

IOE SOAP

,Carsickness, it would be easy to

decipher their excitement-
especially about their new album,
Sharpen Up For Duty—but the group is
dismayed about the critical

responses the album has received.
Once this is mentioned, I begin to
shift in my seat as six pairs of eyes
stare at me. I begin to eye the dis-
tance to the door when I notice that
Soap is trying to say something.
"Nobody's really criticized it," he
says. "They just say our music's a
Psychedelic Furs cover or something
shallow like that.

The group is also disappointed that
no critic has yet derived the anti-war
sentiment of the album. This leads to
their pointing out the various
themes of the songs. "Never‘Walk
Alone" is a reaction to the Atlanta
child killings, while both "Warriors"

and "Runaway Soldiers" offer two
different viewpoints of the fighting
soldier.

"On Sharpen Up For Duty, we tried to
develop different characters and dif-
ferent sounds—there's some punk,
some pop, folk and rock," says Soap.
Indeed, the band maintains that
they've tried to stay away from any
formulated sound, including at
times, their own. "It would be easy
for us to go out and make an album of
hits with "Cancertown," "For You"
and "Modern Knowledge," com-
ments Soap, "but we didn't go in to

with the ou "ii for the day.
Soap mentions that it's time to prac-
tice, and I find myself being slowly
expelled from the microcosm of
music and practice that this band
inhabits. As the rest of the band
heads for their instruments, Hans
offers me a ride back to Oakland
which I eagerly accept. On the way
back down the stairs and into the
night air, he mentions that on
November 22, Carsickness will be
playing David Lawrence Auditorium
along with 96 Tears. Save for that
comment, the ride back to town is
silent, until, just as he pulls the van
over to the curb again, I think of
another question. As I fumble with
the window lever, I ask Hans how
long he thinks Carsickness will
remain. "I think we all realize that
Carsickness will last only as long as
we can progress and cover new
ground musically and artistically.
Once it becomes apparent that the
band is not going anywhere, we'll
probably go our separate ways," he
says as Islam the van door. "After all,
there's no use putting our name on
something that would violate every-
thing we've stood for in the past."

Ska, like just about every

took hold in the New World, but
it left a smudge—if not a mark—-

and at least one band identified’

with the craze, The English
Beat, continues to make com-

ground for this band, with a
broader range of sounds that
creates milieux, some very
urban, others almost heavenly,
with which The English Beat
have never before experiment-
ed.

Frivolity a la Flock of Seagulls,

the others, The English Beat
backs it up with some class
musicianship.

The opening piano chords of
”I Confess" signal the new
sound this band has acquired; a
sound more bountiful than the
spastic combo beat of  Just
Can't Stop It," and yet, it is just
as danceable. ”End of the Party,”
with its blaring sax and acoustic
12-string, seems to evolve from
that same, lush arrangement,
conjuring up some otherworld
Eden.

Going in a wholly different
direction, the band mixes its
tropical beats with an urban
American funkiness in both
”Sole Salvation" and ”She’s
Going.” The sounds of the gui-
tars here are pure, untouched
by distortion or synthesized
effects.

If that's not enough, then try
”Save it for Later,” on which
The English Beat sound like a

proven rock band similar to Dire .

Straits.

What else? How about a
Latin’-like limbo or traditional
ska, all with delightfully silly
word plays such as ”/la Nata-
raletle, her mom's a rnillionelte/S0 we
shared one last cigarette and shared
false addresses."

This band should be a hit at
any party where mindless con-
versation and physical contact is
intense. Puh eh on de reka playe

WINDS OF CHANGE
Jefferson Starship
Grunt

Jefferson Starship keeps
changing, yet they remain so
much the same. The changes
are in personnel; the songs
aimed at the music charts and
the listening public remain the
same. Winds Of Change brought
on the departure of Aynsley
Dunbar, who was replaced by
Donny Baldwin. This took place
after the album was recorded,
but before its release and sup-
port tour due in town on the
10th of this month.

The music is more of what
you would expect from this
band; that is, everything from
ballads to heavy metal. ”I Will
Stay" is one of the softer cuts; it
is one of the popular love songs
that always end up on the chart.
”Out Of Control” is an ass-
kicker that fits Grace Slick’s
image perfectly. ”I<eep On
Drearnin’/’ ”Be My Lady" and
"Can't Find Love” all feature
great guitar work by Craig Cha-
quico and smooth vocals by
Mickey Thomas. ”Black Widow”
has strong bass lines, compli—
ments of Pete Sears, and has
Grace singing forcefully, as if

 

she were the female black
widow spider preparing to
devour her mate. ”I Came From
The Jaws Of The Dragon,”
written by Jefferson Airplane
founder and Starship rhythm
guitarist Paul Kanter and”Quit
Wasting Time" close out the
album in the proper way, with-
out a letup.
Winds Of Change isn't much of
a change, but it’s”not stagnant.
This is what one would guess
Jefferson Starship would put
out—great songs and polished
production. This album receives
highest recommendations.

PAT TRAVERS’ BLACK
PEARL - J
Pat Travers & Black Pearl
Polydor

Pat Travers is best known for
his live version of ”Boom Boom,
Out Go The Lights." The

 

  

 

release of Pat Travers’ Black Pearl
will do nsthmg tti thshgé that:

Black Pearl features Travers
on guitars, keys and vocals; the
rest of the band is Peter
Cowling (bass), Don Harriss
(piano, synthesizers) and Sandy
Gennaro (drums). All are com-
petent, but nothing here is truly
testing. The songs are slightly
below-average power-pop/
heavy metal fare; it all adds up
to pretty dull stuff.

Recommended (but none too
highly) are ’’I'd Rather See You
Dead," "Stand Up," ”Rockin’ ”
and ”The Fifth.” ”The Fifth" is
yet another remake of Beetho—
ven’s symphony. Sorry guys,
guitars don't cut it here.

Pal Travers’ Black Pearl is
another throwaway destined to
be bought and forgotten by the
masses. SAVE YOUR MONEY
——just forget it before you buy!

EDDIE MURPHY
Eddie Murphy
Columbia

He's one of the new crowd
from Saturday Night Live—Eddie
Murphy—and this album was
recorded live in New York City.
There's an apt notice on the out-
side of the package warning that
some of the lyrical content may
be offensive to some listeners.
The audience is enthusiastic,
though, clapping and chanting
"Eddie, Eddie," until he tells
them, "Calm down. You're out
there clapping your ass off-I
might not even be funny."

He is, occasionally. Murphy
discusses homosexuality,
grandmothers, Chinese food,
car accidents, alcoholic parents
and Christmas gifts. He estab-
lishes [good rapport with the
crowd, and he travels from topic
to topic with ease. Some of his
appeal—judging from audience
response——is visual and there-
fore lost to the listener. What do
we do when he tells to us to
"watch?"

Much of the material is unne-
cessarily crude—for instance,
the extended segment concern-
ing the size of the male organ.
The funniest sequence chastises
the "Little Rascals” for their
names. "I come from a predomi-
nantly black family," he says,
"and I have yet to run into a
relative named 'Buckwheat.’ "
He continues, lamenting the
practice of naming children
after "father’s favorite
breakfast." ’

Two musical numbers are
included; "Boogie In Your Butt,"
a sly send-up of rap songs and
"Enough Is Enough," a duet
featuring Eddie Murphy as
Richard Simmons and Buck-
wheat (a sort of cover of the
Donna Summer-Barbara Strei-

sand hit).

Like most comic albums, it
won't hold up after repeated lis-
tenings. Borrow it from a friend
and play it once or twice if
you're interested.

RICHARD SATER

SPRING SESSION M .
Missing Persons
Capitol Records

First, there was Heart. Then
came Blondie, the Go-Go's, X,
the Motels and a bunch of other
groups. The similarity? If you
haven't figured it out, all have a
female lead singer. Now joining
the ranks of these bands is Miss-
ing Persons, fronted by lead sin-
ger, Dale Bozzio and her
husband, Terry. Already A vic-
tims of media hype, the band is
almost a shoo-in to become one
of the big new groups of the
'80s. And they deserve it.
Acclaimed in L.A. and expe-
rienced after work with Frank

-Zappa, Missing Persons com-
bines Dale Bozzio's distinctive
vocals (she has a catchy way of
jumping to higher octaves on
whim), interesting music and
lyrics by the Bozzio's and
Warren Cucurullo and a new
wave/synthesizer pop sound to
form a simply excellent debut
LP. .

The album opens with
"Noticeable One,” the Bozzio's
declaration of their goals: "I'll
take you out with the things that Isay/I
draw the crowds, and whenever I'm
ready/ I've got what it takes to blow
them all away." And they do.
Intelligent, but not pretentious,
all of the songs on sideione are
very good. When you flip the
record or tape over to side two,
things get even better. Side two I
starts with the energetic,
hooked-up "Tears," shortly fol- g

Golly Gee, A Letter!

Dear Editor:

"The Clash’s ideology fails again.”
What's the point of even mentioning
ideology if the crowd only dances to a
pianoless version of "Rock the Cas-
bah" and everybody's favorite
"Should I Stay or Should I Go?"
Pseudo-punk attire abounded, as Mr.
Erkel pointed out. You can always tell
"those kind of people," the majority
of who like the Clash, Donnie Iris and
Pat Benatar. (How they do this, I
don't know.) Why even try to talk
about social meaning ("The Call Up")
when only a third of the audience has
heard most of the songs, and most of
them don't know the words.
Granted, our friends from Camden
Town want to reach as many people
as possible, but there's not much of a
point in seeing them if you don't
know what the songs are about.

O.K. So knowing all of the lyrics
may be a lot to ask of people obsessed
with rocking into the night, but if
you're going to dress up and not look
like you usually do, (trying to look
like a punk, I mean) the least you can
do is dance. All you have to do is jump
up and down. No fancy disco steps or
hip motion, just leap about and forget
everything. (No, you don't have to
slam.)

I noticed several feet between
myself and others at the gig, appar-
ently they thought I was weird or
something. ("Hey Bill, check out that

A x-w ar..’c»,.u a » 2: 1;.‘ no 1. ‘we ~ *'-*4?"-‘I

punker. What an asshole, dancing to
the Clash.")

What's that? You'll be too tired?
You don't think Joe Strummer gets
tired? At 20 feet from the stage, I had
a good view of the sweat dripping
from the man. But what does he
know—he and Terry Chimes have to
look at each other while they're play-
ing because they obviously don't
know what's going on. Has Mr. Erkel
ever been in a group, I wonder? Well,
he should be in one someday,and he
should try to play "Stay Free" while
standing still. It doesn't matter any-
how, since I don't think anyone there
ever heard anything off Give 'Em
Enough Rope.

The point is, if you're going to see a
group like the Clash, either know
what kind of reasoning they have
behindtheir songs or take your Pat
Benatar records and argue with each
other about who is sexist while all the
record companies laugh to the bank.

("Gig" is one of our favorite words...The

down before rigor mortis sets in...fEd.)

3"» vs

lowed by "Here and Now," "Bad
Streets" and the tour de force,
"Words." "Words" addresses
the problem of the attention-
seeker in the '80s: "Pursue it any
fiurther, and another thing you'llfind/
Not only are they deafand dumb, they
could be going blind/No one notices; I
think I'll dye my hair blue/Media
overload bombarding you with action/
It's getting near impossible to cause dis-
traction/Someone answerime before I
pull out the plug." Missing Per-
sons finish Spring Session M with
"Rock and Roll Suspension" and
"No Way Out," two songs that

affirm their punk/new wave

beginnings.

I like this band for pretty
much the same reasons that I
liked the Go-Go's last year.
They have a eonfident; fresh
sound and one feels that they
would be "dancing to their beat"
(from "Bad Streets"), commer-
cial success or not, unlike Fleet-
wood Mac, who declared in a
recent interview that they
would break up if they stopped
selling albums. I just hope Miss-
ing Persons never gets that
way.

THE GUN CLUB ‘

numbers. Their debut album on
Slash, Fire of Love was one of the
more intriguing montages to
emerge from the L.A. under-
ground scene, odd as it was.
Miami, Gun Club's first album
for the newly-formed Animal
Records (Blondie-man Chris
Stein's new label, distributed
through Chrysalis) finds the
group holding onto their
integrity—just because they've
signed with a bigger label
doesn't mean they've cut off any
of their roots or lost their origi-
nal approach.
The Gun Club doesn't sound
exactly like anyone else, but
comparisons can be drawn eas-
ily because there is such an
abundance of them. The most
obvious analogues; stylistically;
seem to be the Doors (note the
,ominous drive of the chords,
especially on "Devil In The
Woods" and "Sleeping In Blood
City") and traditional bluesmen
like’ Howlin' Wolf (Pierce’s
delivery and inflections). But
they also reminded me at times
of artists as diverse as John Lee
Hooker and Human Switch-
board; maybe this is where Gun
Club's ingenuity lies—-taking a
bit of everything and molding it
into something that sounds
new.

Whatever the case, Miami
ought to be listened to, if not for
the fact that it's not syntho—pop
drivel, then at least because it
lets Gun Club show their roots.

Notre Dame: An Obstacle In Path To Major Bowl

weapon.

..lrish Coach Faust
Adjusts To College
Level Coaching

By IRA M. KATZ

In November of 1980, Notre
Dame concluded a nationwide

' search for a head football coach by

selecting Gerry Faust as Dan
Devine's successor.

Faust had 21 long history of win-
ning at Moeller High School in
Ohio. He guided his teams to 174
wins against only 17 losses atrd two
ties over an 18-year period.

Faust's arrival at Notre I)ame
was greeted with mixed emotions.

Critics cited Faust as a novice at the
collegiate level and said that he
would have difficulty adapting to
college football.

Some of the anticipated prob-
lems did develop last year, Notre
Dame struggled to a 5-6 record.
The transition from Moeller High
School, which has an enrollment
of 1,000 students, to a major uni-
versity like tradition—rich
Dame, had to l)e considered a learn-
ing experience.

“I had to learn how to handle
losing football games," Faust said.
“I didn’t have much experience in
that area, atrd I probably let it affect
me more than it should have."

Preparing a collegiate football
squad was a new challenge for
Faust. “That was a difficult period
of adjustment for me last year,"
Faust said, adding, “It's a big tran-
saction. no matter how much you

think you know about football."

From 1963 to 1980. as coach of
Moeller lligh, Faust was building
a football dynasty. llis Crusaders
won the Greater Cincinnati
League (Ihampionships during
each of his last eight years.

see, but that is their prerogative.
They've got to write what they
want to write.” Faust said, “I don’t
hold that against anybody—never
have, never will.”

Faust brought with him to _Notre
Dame a large number of his former
Moeller High players. Presently on
the Irish squad are 19 former Cru-
saders, including such notables as
All-America candidate split end
Tony Hunter and linebacker Mike
Larkin.

This year, the adjustment has
been easier for both Faust and his
team. For starters, the Irish have a
5-1-1 record on the season heading
into this week's game against Pitt.

“Well, I don't know if every-
thing is on target," Faust said. “We
would've liked to have been 12-0
last year and 7-0 at thisgime, but
realistically we can see the light at
the end of the tunnel."

Faust may receive a better irrdica—
tion of how good the current edi-
tion of Notre Dame is within the
next couple weeks, when his, team
battles Pitt, Penn State and USC.

“I think"you can go back and rate
your team after the season," Faust
said. “When it is over, then you can
look back and rnakejudgernerrts on
how well you've done.

“The differences at this level,
even between the ll—0 teams and
the -1-7 learns, are small enough
that you can't expect to overpower
anyone," Faust said. “You've got
to be ready to play each week."

()rre man who definitely won't
seem unfamiliar to Faust tomor-
row when Pitt hosts Notre Dame is
Panther coach Foge Fa/io. Their
friendship goes back to when Fa/.io
was coach at the l‘niversity of (Zin-
cinnati, where be recruited many of
Faust's high school players.

".-\nytirne you coach against a
friend or a person you know very
well," Fazio said, "gives you a little
extra desire to succeed."

It's Notre Dame versus Pitt, past
against present, tradition challeng-
ing sheer talent.

It's much more. If players have
“jitterbugs” before playing the
Irish, what does an administration
have, knowing that the difference
between winning and losing could
amount to well over $1 million.

An image suggests itself. The
game is tied entering the fourth
quarter, and Chancellor Wesley W.
Posvar perspires as if state alloca-
tions were about to be announced.

Such may be the case when Pitt
battles Notre Dame tomorrow
afternoon at Pitt Stadium. The sce-
nario may keep the Pitt adminis-
tration turning all night—Pitt
loses to Notre Dame and has a 9-1
record with Penn State to follow,
when bowl bids are extended on
November 20.

The major bowl committees,
fearing that Pitt will lose its final
game to Penn State and end the
season with two losses, bypass Pitt
for other 9-1 teams. Alabama, Penn
State, Arizona State, the Pac-10
runnerup and the loser of the
SMU-Arkansas game are all likely
candidates.

Pitt associate athletic director
Dean Billick shied away from com-
menting by saying, “We're not
thinking about the bowl games-
we're concerned with Notre
Dame.”

Pitt is concerned too, especially
about Notre Dame's defense. The
Irish rank fifth in total defense,



Gerry Faust

allowing an average of 233 yards a
game. They are among the stingi-
est in scoring defense, yielding a
scant 12.4 points.

“Their defense is very physical,
big and strong,” said Pitt coach
Foge Fazio. “No one has scored

more than two touchdowns on.

them."

Even more impressive is that
Notre Dame is second in rushing
defense, allowing just 56.4 yards
per contest. Still, Fazio plans on
loosening the Irish defense with
the run.

“We plan on running,” Fazio
said earlier this week. “We have to
establish the run.”

Notre Dame's leading tacklers
are linebackers Mike Larkin and
Mark Zavagnin. They typify the
entire Irish defense—aggressive
and tough. Larkin has 68 tackles,
while Zavagnin has 61.

The secondary accounted for six
interceptions against Navy last
week. Free safety Dave Duerson
had three himself.

“Their secondary is outstand-
ing," Fazio said. “They’re very
physical,and they play great cover-
age. They make the big plays.

“They don’t play a whole lot of
man," Fazio said, “but they play a
three-deep zone, and they break on
the ball well. They are all 6-1, 6-2
and all are good hitters."

Notre Dame.has some offensive
threats too, despite scoring two
touchdowns or less in four of seven
games. The biggest weapon has
been tight end Tony Hunter, who
has 29 receptions for 354 yards.

“He's a first round draft choice,”
Fazio said. “He’s 6-5, 225 and can
run a 4.6 40.” .

“He’s one of the best tight ends
in the nation,” added Notre Dame
coach Gerry Faust.

Quarterback Blair Kiel has
thrown just two touchdown passes.
He has had a problem with consis-
tency, sometimes showing shades
of great Irish quarterbacks of the
past, other times resembling a man
out of place in Notre Dame
tradition.

“He's had good games and bad
games," Faust said, “but we'll still
stick with him.”

“He's a roll-out quarterback,"
Fazio said. “We have to contain
him."

Notre Dame's offense depends
on a grinding running game. Tail-

back Phil Carter is the Irish’s lead- ’

ing rusher with 504 yards. He has
been suffering with a thigh bruise,
but is 100 percent, according to
Faust. Fullback Larry Moriarty is

averaging nearly six yards per

carry.

The Notre Dame scoring method
is definable: Run theball inside the
opponent’s 50-yard line and call on
place kicker Mike Johnston, who
has _connected on 15 of 16 field
goals attempts. At one point, he
kicked 13 consecutively before hav-
ing an attempt blocked last week
against Navy. He's perfect on seven
tries from beyond the 40-yard line.

Johnston's leg may well be the
difference of, say, 351 million.

 

 

Spikers T ripped By Penn State

‘By MARK A. SINDLER

It has been cotnrnonplace this
season for the Lady Panther volley-
ball team to come from behind and
win their matches.

This was somewhat dinrmed
\\'ednesday evening when Pitt was
defeated by Penn State's Lady
l.ions 2-113, ll—l.3, ll-I5. Despite
this loss, the Lady Panthers did
win the seasonal war with a 2-1
advantage.

Pitt Coach Sheldon Collier

looked to Penn State's overall state
of readiness as reason for success in
their third encounter.

“They have had revenge in mind
for the last two weeks," he said.
“The team just came off of wins
and

l.n contrast, Pitt, after a very
draining weekend, was coming off
wins against several top southern
schools.

“The staff and the entire team
had difficulty coming back and
shifting gears," Collier said. “It
was a lot to ask to get them up
emotionally. We didn't even have
enough time to review scouting
reports."

The loss was not devoid of posi-
tive signs for the Panthers. The
match. as has been the caseover the
last couple of weeks, adds impetus
to the preparation for the Big East
Charnpionships, which will be
held one week from today in
Providence.

“As a result of this loss." Collier

said, “we \'ill be more rnaturely,

"‘ i 0' ’l.—>*iv-H W H.~Is—awum.m n.*vas:.i-guest’: 5 2.3:; *2» 3 .n«.«za. an a.»a.=-.u:,ar.-:I.&:»y;.~a, n.~w.e.a,,~i‘,gt~-1 .w;au.' .')‘_“'V.’_.> -

physically and strategically pre-
pared for the playoffs."

Collier further elaborated in say-
ing his squad learned as much in
defeat as they would have itr vic-
tory. Even the post-garne meeting
after the game was positive, he said.

Because the team has had such
paramount mountains to scale this
season, the team readily under-
stands its “underdog" position and
strives constantly to ready them-
selves mentally during practice
sessions.

“I think now we understand we
can't just snapour fingers and have
the positive intangibles come
true," Collier said. “As a result of
this loss, the team will now take
seriously what is ahead of them.

There will be an increased
awareness."  M

2-1 loss to West Virginia.

Booters Lose To West Virginia 

By JIM COLLINS

Despite the outstanding perfor-
mances of goalie Dave Torrence
and the Pitt defense. West Virginia
disappointed the upset-minded
Panthers 2-] Wednesday night in
the last home game of the I982
soccer season.

Both teams had trouble mount-
ing an offense due to the driving
rain thoughout the game. But Tor-
rence kept the Panthers in the
game—a game in which West Vir-
ginia was heavily favored.

The freshman from Arlington,
\’a., come up with save after save.
including two from penalty kicks.

West Virginia’s Al)ibou Niang
took the first kick, and Pitt's Dave
Torrence tipped the l)all enough so
that the ball bounced off the post.

There’s some good news and

the results of tommorrow’s games.

fine. Send me 10 percent of your
winnings. If you lose your shirt,
don’t come after me.

Anyway, enough of this drivel-—
let’s get to this week's picks. Pitt
over Notre Dame—The Panthers
are on a roll thanks to Louisville.
The Fighting Irish have recovered
from their mid-season slump and
should be ready to face a team the
caliber of Pitt.

But Notre Dame's offensive line
has been hurt by injuries. Pitt’s
defense should thrive on that. 24-

West Virginia over Ternple——
The Mountaineers want that bowl

that’s not going to stop West Virgi
nia. 23-l0. ‘

Louisiana State over Alabama-
The only reason I’m picking LSU
is because my managing editor
promised me a dinner if I picked
her favorite team. Well, I can’t be

on the rebound. but Torrence was
right there to stop it. With the
incredible save, Torrence not only
kept the Panthers in the game, but
also sparked the team. ‘

Three minutes after Torrence's
save. Pitt was on the scoreboard.
Danny Zamanski passed the l)all in
the center of the field to Sparky
Lucke. I.ucke flicked the ball
between two Mountaineer defend-
ers to the foot of john llagenbuch.
Hagenbnch tucked the ball in the
corner to put the Panthers ahead
1-0.

West Virginia quickly tied the
score before Pitt could adjust to the
offensive pressure. Niang was com-
pletely unmarked in the middle as
he volleyed a corner kick into the
net. just as Torrence's save sparked
the Panthers earlier, the goal

seemed to ignite the Mountaineers.

West Virginia began to domi-
nate the game. They applied more
pressure to Pitt’.s defense. Frustra-
tion was a result of all the pressure
and the Mountaineers were
awarded their second penalty kick
of the night.

()nce again, Torrence was equal
to the task. The only difference was
that this time he cleanly caught the
l)all and did not tip it off the post.

Willi 1.3 minutes left in the game, 

the Mountaineers broke the tie for
good.‘ Bruce Moyo kicked in a loose
ball in front of the net and the
Panthers were down 2—l.

Men Netters Look Impressive

By TIM DINGER

While the Big East Tournament
spelled the end of the women's ten-
nis season, it marked the beginning
for the men’s team, which has to
wait until spring for its regular sea-
son. However, they still competein
the Big East during the fall.

“It’s hard to train for just one
tournament and then be off until
spring," said tennis coach George
Dieffenbach. “But we'll be training
hard indoors for the winter, and I

‘expect a very successful season.”

At the Big East, the Panthers tied
Seton Hall for fifth place, which
came as a surprise to some of their
competition.

“I was extremely pleased with
the men's performance,” Dieffen-
bach said. “They came into the
tournament with virtually no fall
season and surprised other teams
by winning some matches."

At No. 1 singles for Pitt, James
McDonald deseated St. John’s
Dean Ehren in what Dieffenbach
called “the best match of the tour-
nament.” McDonald won a 10-8

"I was surprised to find the com-
petition so strong. The girls played
their hearts out, but we didn't have
the experience the other teams
had."

A No. 1 singles, Pitt's Cathy Ja-
cobson lost to Seton Hall’s Peggy
Tauli 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, which dropped
her from the single elimination
tournament. _

At No.2 singles, Pitt's Lisa Lafu-
ria was eliminated by Seton Hall’s
Peggy Savage 6-4, 7-5.

Pitt’s Miriam Goltz fell to Nancy

tie-breaker in the opening set and
went on to defeat Ehren 7-6, 5-7,
6-2.

In the semi-finals, McDonald
was throttled by Boston College's
John O’Connell 6-1, 6-2. O’Con-
nell eventually won the
tournament.

by Providence’s Mike Curran 6-0,

Lacking
Revenue

continued from page twenty

Thus, the non-revenue athletesi
participate in their. respective
sports for the love of it. The non-
revenue athletes can truly compre-
hend the “thrill of victory and
the “agony of defeat,’ for they put
their hearts into every minute of
competition.

Whenever fans or sports writers
refer to these non-revenue sports as
“minor sports” it is inappropriate.
“Minor" suggests that non-
revenue sports are lesser in nature,
less important. Can a team which
practices 364 days out of a year be
considered lesser than football,
whose players have the winter
months off? The non-reveniie ath-
letes may not graf) headlines every
week, but they toil and sweatjust as
hard.

So during these autumn weeks
when the sports pages are flooded
with football and all the talk
around campus centers upon “the
game," think of those athletes who
ask for very little. They may not
earn notoriety or the money that
Pitt football does, but the non-
reyenue athletes deserve as much
respect for their efforts as anyone.

“The one thing we need to get is
depth,” Dieffenbach added. “The
other teams have depth all the way
down the line. Hopefully we can
have a good recruiting year, and
have returners get stronger over the
summer.”
