Gre_ek community sets expansion timeline  

Pat McAteer
News Editor

Because of itsrelatively small size

and large potential, ‘Pitt’s Greek

community has attracted the in-

terest of four national fraternities.

And the University’s Interfrater-.
nity Council isin full support of
their becoming a part of Greek

life at Pitt. ‘

After meeting with representa-

tives from six national fraternity
organizations, Pitt IFC has estab-
lished a timeline of colonization‘
for four different Greek organi-

zations, including Beta Theta Pi,
Delta Sigma Phi, Alpha Tau Qmega
and Phi Gamma Delta. . - ,

According to the Pitt Frater-

nity and Sorority Life Policies and‘

Procedures Manual, a colony is “a
student organization in the ﬁnal
stage prior to being installed as

a chartered chapter of a fraternal

organization.” . . »
IFC President Zach Patton said
the prospective fraternities will

gain colony status over the next‘

-four years, with BTP joining ﬁrst

~ next fall, DSP in fall 2014, ATO
* in spring 2016 and PGD in spring

2017. V

Before they received consider-
ation for colonization, Patton said
representatives from the national

 fraternities gave presentations
that included statistics regarding ,

academics, the local alumni base
and alumni contributions.

’ Bobby Grangier, ATO’s direc-
tor of expansion, said Pitt was an
attractive location for expansion

_ because the fraternity is returning
~ to Carnegie Mellon University next

fall, and he hoped to establish a

greater presence in Pittsburgh. He

also said that representatives from

Pitt reached out to ATO’s national
fraternity and communicated that
Pitt had a large number of male
students with. high grade point

"averages who weren’t currently

aﬂiliated with a fraternity.
“There was a lot of interest
from multiple organizations in
general,” Grangier said. ;
Phil Erford, BTP’s director of
expansion, largely echoed Grang-

ier’s sentiments in anemail, tout- ‘

ing Pitt’s strong academic reputa-
tion.

“We found the Pitt campus attractive
because we believe that there are many stu-
dents here who are interested in embrac-
ing Beta’s corevalues of mutual assistance,
intellectual growth, trust, responsible con-
duct.and integrity,” he said.

Nik Koulogeorge, DSP’s assistant direc-

 

tor of fraternity growth, said the fraternity '
used to have a chapter on Pitt’s campus — '

which he said was one of DSP’s ﬁrst — as
well as a large alumni base in Pittsburgh.
He added that “the message Pitt offers” in
terms of innovation and forward tlfinking
aligns with that of DSP.

Brett Pytel, PGD’s director of expansion,
said that, like DSP, his fraternity enjoyed a
long history on campus. He said the PGD’s
ﬂagship chapter was ﬁrst formed at the
University when it was still the Pittsburgh
Academy. It existed on campus until 1863,
when membership began to decline because
of the U.S. Civil War.

In 1916, Pitt students expressed interest
in having PGD return to campus. It remained
an active fraternity until 1998. Because of.

    

its long history, Pytel said, :there’s a large
and enthusiastic alumni base remaining in
the city. He also said that Pitt’s Greek Life
administration is ﬁrmly established, which
gave the national fraternity conﬁdence that
a chapter could ﬂourish on campus. .
After meeting with the representatives,
IFC members consulted with Pitt Greek Life
Adviser Dustin Page, the expansion com-
mittee and the group’s general counsel to
establish timelines for colonization. ‘
Page said in an email that for the re-
spective fraternities, he considers factors
such as the alumni support within the city,
whether their national policies align with
Pitt’s policies, colonization procedures
and standards, national and international

strength, success rate at similar institu- '

tions, national and international support
and assistance, and the values and goals of
the organization.

He also said that the reputation of the

four new fraternities precedes them.

“All four organizations also have strong
success rates with colonies at similar insti-
tutions, where they have positively con-
tributed to the Greek Community. We are
positive that all four of the inter/national
organizations

A will help build the community in a posi-
tive direction,” Page said.
Patton said each of the organizations can

5 begin dialogue regarding colonization one

to two semesters "before its invitation date.
He-said this entails having a representative
from the national fraternity live near Pitt’s
campus and establish connections withstu—
dent groups such as Student Government
Board and Pitt Pathﬁnders.

He added that this method of Greek‘
‘community expansion could attract stu-

dents who would not typically choose to
join fraternities. . ‘
“This way, we’re taking students that
maybe didn’t want to go Greek, and now
they’re going to be solicited by these recruit-
ers,” Patton said. '
This top-down approach to colonization

differs from other Greek organizations, .

Patton said. He cited the process that led
to the establishment of Pi Kappa Phi, which
became a chartered fraternity in the spring
semester of last year. " .
PKP began as aninterest group two years
ago after the organization’s former presi-
dent, Sean Zajdel, a senior nursing major,

"transferred to Pitt from Albright College.

Zajdel was a member of PKP at Albright,

 

and, after transferring to Pitt, he and a
group of Pitt students began the push to
establish the fraternity on campus.

The aggressive expansion of Pitt’s Greek

_ community is part of a broad set of initia-
tives Patton has pursued as president of
IFC. Patton said he’s focused on improvi
ing campuswide perception of the Greek
community through a new public relations
campaign. .

He said one of the initiatives he hopes
to highlight through the campaign is IFC’s
improvedVGPA requirement for fraternity
-members. Current rules forbid ﬁrst—semes-
ter fréshmen from joining fraternities since

they don’t have a recorded GPA, but Pat- .

ton said these rules are largely ignored. He
hopes to improve the enforcement'of this
rule by allowing ﬁrst-semester freshmen
to participate in recruitment events, but
not to become initiated until their second
semester, when they have a recorded GPA..

Patton said the new push by IFC to en-
force GPA requirements is part of a new-
found effort to -increaseparticipation and
diversity within the Pitt Greek community.

“Our hope is that people 'who wouldn’t
normally be willing to go Greek’ might be
willing to do so,” he said.’ I

GOLDWATER

Scholars across the United States. Universities
nominated 1,107 mathematics, science and
engineering students for the award this year.

Before consideration on the national level,
aspiring Goldwater Scholars must ﬁrst submit
their applications to a committee of Univer—
sity professors and faculty who choose four
nominees to present to the national selection
committee.

Goldwater Scholar Adair Borges is a ju-
nior microbiology major from Billings, Mo.
Borges’ interest in microbiology research
began in high school when she found success
at a number of local science fairs. Soon she
found herself with invitations to national and
international science project competitions. At
Pitt, Borges has primarily worked in the lab of
Pitt assistant professor of biology Jon Boyle
and focused her research efforts on studying
the roleof proteins in infections.

“My project has been kind of constantly
evolving and changing over the time I’ve
worked there,” Borges said.

This work earned her a Howard Hughes
Medical Institute Fellowship for the summer
of 2012 as well as for the current academic
year. Borges hopes to continue research work
on the graduate level in the future.

“I just want to keep working in a lab where
I can be really excited about the research,”
she said. -

neering, mathematics and economics major

Goldwater winners David Eckman and Michael Nites (not pictured: Adair Borges) and
Udall winner Nikki Luke. Photos ‘courtesy Chris Chirdon, Bobby Mizia, Nikki Luke

from Pittsburgh, will receive a Goldwater
Scholarship in large part for his work on
several research, projects for UPMC. Since
December 2011, Nites has completed ﬁve
projects in total. Among these endeavors was
the discovery of a more efficient system for
delivering pharmaceutical drugs to operating
rooms, improvement of cancer examination
carts at the Hillman Cancer Center to improve
medical worker efficiency and limiting the
number of times medical personnel touch a
blood sample in order to process it. Nites is
currently working on a project to improve the
schedules of UPMC workers in a manner satis-
factory to both the workers and management.

In addition to his three majors and re-

search projects, N ites also serves as a member
of Pitt’s Student Government Board.

“I don’t sleep,” he joked.

Nites found his way to industrial engineer-
ing after realizing that he wished to work in
health care, but didn’t like interacting with
the gore many health care professionals en-
counter on a daily basis. ' ‘

“I was always interested in health care, but
I’m sort of squearnish,” Nites said.

After graduating, Nites plans to attend
graduate school and study operational re-
search, a ﬁeld thatauses advanced analytics
to help make better decisions.

Like fellow awardee -Nites, Goldwater
Scholar David Eckman is an industrial engi-

neering major. His research, conducted under
the supervision of industrial engineering pro-
fessor Andrew Schaefer, has focused on im-
proving operations in hospital intensive care
unitsand operating rooms at The University
Drive Division of VA Pittsburgh Healthcare
System. Eckman is currently participating
in a co—op with the Supply Chain Logistics
Department at H._]. Heinz North America. '

Industrial engineering’s focus on applied
math and versatility drew Eckman to the ﬁeld.

The Fargo, N.D., native is captain of a team
in the‘ Pittsburgh Chess League, an activity
that has imparted on him life lessons.

“Chess really helps with decision making
and evaluating situations you ﬁnd yourself
in, either in school or work,” Eckman said.

In the ﬁiture, Eckman hopes to pursue
postgraduate studies in the ﬁeld of opera-
tional research.

Junior Nikki Luke is oneof 50 students
nationally to win a Udall scholarship forwork
related to the environment, Native American
health care or tribal public policy. Luke, an
environmental studies and economics double
major, earned the scholarship for a long track
record of research and activism related to the
environment. Luke’s focus in recent years has
been on the issue of desertiﬁcation, the loss
of water from often already arid areas of land.
In 2010, she attend a United Nations conven-
tion on the issue of desertiﬁcation in China.

action is important and why it’s important to

Everyone likes a good secret, but '

everyone loves a good scandal.
Secrets only become interesting
when they’re made public.
Thanks to the Internet, baring
your soul has never been easier.
‘ Sites such as PostSec"ret and FMy-
Life allow peopleto reveal things
they probably wouldn’t share at
the dinner table.
Over spring break, sharing

thanks to the creation of the Face-
book pages Pitt Secrets and Pitt
Exposed. They join the existing
page, Pitt Crushes, which was cre-
ated in February.

Pitt Crushes functions the
same way as school—yard notes
did in primary school—— tell
someone ydu think.she’s cute and
hope she thinks the same about
you —. but on Pitt Crushes, your
compliment is anonymous and
more likely to be rated PG-13.‘

Pitt Secrets allows you to

want, which is the same thing Pitt
Exposed does, only with a differ-
ent proﬁle picture.

There are several common
themes throughout the posts,
the most prominent being rela-
tionships. People post about their
struggles to ﬁnd signiﬁcant oth-
ers at Pitt, their insecurities about
being liked and how to best ap-
proach people despite lacking the
conﬁdence todo so. _ ‘

writes, “I don’t care about ﬁnding the per-
fect guy, I just want to be a great girlfriend
to SOMEONE.”

Another student on Pitt Crushes writes,
“Cute blonde that works at the pizza bar in
Oakland. I’m‘one of your Thursday night
regulars. You’re beautiful, smart and funny.
I’m in dire need of your digits.” T

However, Pitt Crushes and Pitt Secrets
seem to perpetuate a cycle of loneliness. —
You post about how much you want a boy-
friend on one page and then gush about the
men’s swim team on another, but nothing
changes. Anonymity might save your pride,’
but it kills the chances of your confession
ever amounting to anything in reality.

If you want to reap the rewards, you have
to take the risks. Playing it safe doesn’t
get you far.

Pitt Crushes, although it might be ﬂat- ,
tering at times, doesn’t do much for either
party. The person receiving the compli-
ment is often‘ left curious as tothe poster’s
identity (and sometimes a bit creeped out
depending on the comment), and the poster
gets a virtual pat on the back for saying
something nice — not very rewarding.

The'idea of spilling your secrets on
Facebook isn’t unique to Pitt: It’s a col-
legettrend. But I think we can do better.

could be easy to do as well. Why not identify
yourself when posting about heartbreakor

loneliness or your qualms with religion? -

There are so many students experi-

Fan reaction to Pitt athlete news evidence of troubling trend

People care too much about college athletics. Bobby Mizia |Assistant Visual Editor

Nate Barnes
Senior Stcyj’ Wrz'ter

The week hasn’t treated fans of the Pitt
basketball and football programs too
kindly. . . A
Freshman tailback Rushel Shell an-
nounced on Monday that he would trans-
fer from the football team.
And on Tuesday, another transfer sur-

faced in the form of junior Trey Zeigler,

who left the basketball team as a result
of not ﬁtting in with head coach Jamie
Dixon’s program. Never mind that Zeigler
transferred to Pitt from Central Michigan
last summer and was immediately eligible
to play because of the NCAA granting him
a hardship waiver after his father Ernie
Zeigler was ﬁred from his post as head
coach of the men’s basketball program at
Central Michigan. 7 . "

And then freshman center Steven Ad-
ams dropped the most destructive bomb
later that night, when news broke at about
8 p.m. that he hadldeclared for the NBA
Draft. Adams, one of the program’s most
highly touted recruits ever, announced
his decision after returning home to New

Zealand and likely speaking with family
members about his future plans.

The decision to leave comes a few
weeks after Adams said, following Pitt’s
embarrassing loss to Wichita-State in»;
the NCAA tournament, “I’m definitely‘
coming back. I don’t know why you guys
keep asking that question. I’m deﬁnitely
coming back.”

But the worst part_ about the depar-
tures had nothing to do with the players.
It had to do with the fans, and how they’ M
reacted to the decisions these young men
made. -

Here’s a hard truth, Pitt fans:

All of what has happened is fine.

And‘ if more players decide they want
to leave, that’s fine too. 

Because really, we sit here and watch

(these college -students -— yes, that’s what

they are, college students — and think
we know what’s best for them.

But don’t let me lecture you from the
pulpit. Direct your attention to the Twit-,_ 3
tersphere and review some of the tweets“
mentioning the players, such as the ones

THE MARKUP

Maj or

A e Baseball is back,

time to relax and enjoy it

Mark Powell
F or The Pitt News

Just as winter begins to feel like it will
never end, the ﬁrst two weeks in April
provide us with an early vacation. Spring
ﬂirts with summer, and America’s favorite
pastime regains its rightful place on top
of the Mt. Rushmore of sports. Ballparks
open their gates, fans return to their seats
and players resume putting on a spectacle
in front of thousands on a daily basis.

Thesounds of spring provide an eerie,
all-too-familiar reminder of past failures
and feats. The ghosts of seasons past re-
main not in-the stadium, not-in the stands,
but in the memory of every fan who walks
through that gate. The boys of summer
are at it again.

This will be the second'MLB.season
since MLB Commissioner Bud Selig de-
cided to expand the playoffs to include
two wild—card teams. It’s fair to expect
some late—season drama as the dog days
of summer give way to the cool nights of
September and October.

In case you missed it, this off—season
had its share of big news. So, let’s recap.

Both L.A. teams made big signings: _“

The Angels picked up Josh Hamilton from
their divisionrival, the Rangers, while
the Dodgers‘ stole Zack Greinke from
their previously mentioned-Crosstown
rivals. Detroit decided its lineup wasn’t

, dominant enough, adding Torii Hunter
and the previously injured Victor Marti— -

nez. The Nationals bolstered an already
ﬁlthy pitching staff with the signing of
Dan Haren, while division rival Atlanta
paired the brothers B._]. and_]ustin'Upton
together to ﬁll the void left by the recently
retired Chipper Jones.

Toronto picked up what seems like half

of the Marlins roster, while the Yankees

“didn’t do much other than get older. Bos— "”

ton added a few veteranpieces in Shane
Victorino and Mike Napoli to try and get
over last year’s sad excuse of a season.
Some big names stayed in their respective
places, includingjustin Verlander, Buster
Posey and-Felix Hernandez.

Locally, thevPirates didn’-t do anything
too notable, which is an improvement for
them‘: Lastly, the Houston Astros moved
from the NL Central to the AL West, which
will surely make them even worse than last
year. But at least the new logo looks cool.

.All told, this season will have many
intriguing story lines to keep fans inter-
ested throughout its 162-_game duration.

Below are my playoff picks and World
Series prediction. If your team didn’t
make it, don’t worry: At least you’re not
an Astros fan.

4 Playoffs: ‘ -

AL: Rays, Tigers, Angels, Rangers, Yan-
kees _ T
NL: Nationals, Reds, Dodgers, Braves,

‘Phillies

World Series: Braves ‘defeating the An-
gels, 4-2 I

calling Shell “b*tch boy” or local radio

personality Mark Madden’s antagonizing
of Shell, saying how “easy, easier, easiest”
he was making Madden’s show.

Shell’s response to the hatred? Once
the news of his transfer came out Tuesday
he tweeted, “I don’t owe this city anything
period y’all make accusations but don’t
know the facts but keep doing what you
do best!”

Yeah, it might seem selﬁsh and prob-
ably something many of us wouldn’t say.

But he’s right. Shell owes us nothing.
Shell is 19 years old. I think we’d all be
hard—pressed to ﬁnd someone who had
his or her life planned out at that age, let
alone what he or she would be doing four
or ﬁve years from that,time.

He’s a teenager. Teenagers make mis-
takes. I made mistakes as a teenager. At
21, I probably still do.

I’m sure many citizens of the world did
too during their college years, or would-
be college years.

And this column isn’t me standing on y

a soapbox wagging my ﬁnger at the col-
lective Pitt fan base.

I think it’s time to re-evaluate the way
fans look at these athletes.

Instead of thinking what might be best
for you whenyou sit down to watch a bas-
ketball or football game for a few hours
every week, think about what these kids
have to do with the lives they have to live
as the objects of your ire or affection for,
you know, 24 hours a day, seven days a
week, 365 days a year.

None of us know what is going on in-
side his head. None of us likely ever will.
Perhaps he’s thinking of how to advance
himself and others he cares about in the
best way, and Pitt isn’t the school to help
him do that. .

Maybe Shell should’ve made the deci-

sion Robert Foster did, when the latter _

chose Alabama over Pitt in December. I
In Adams’ case, look at thereason he_’s

leaving -— family. Kenny McFadden, one

of Adams’ coaches in New Zealand and a

former teammate of Jamie Dixon’s who
helped him discover Adams, told Pitts- '

burgh Post—Gazette beat writer Ray Fit-
tipaldo that Adams’ decision was based
purely on helping family. - '
Through all of this, put all questions
of attitude, class or whatever is going
on for them aside, and just think about

these three people. This isn’t the.last big,

decision they will makein their lives, and
each one ‘certainly has little impact on

. fans’ well-being. p
In related news, Adams no longer has .
. a Twitter account. Do you think maybe

he saw the way fans lashed out at Shell

over nothing .that will ever impact the I
day-to—day proceedings of their own lives —

and just decided, “I don’t want to put up
with that. Hell, I don’t have to.” I

full from the top of the Bulls’ lineup to the
bottom, but she has had success from the
mound in Big East play this season, having
won three games in four starts while striking
out 25 batters in 26 1/3 innings.

While King, the aceof the staff, has lost

  

both games she has started in during confer- _

ence play, herearned run average remains
under four, and she has only allowed eight
earned runs.

Though the Panthers have had sharp
pitching, it will mean little if Pitt cannot’
score a plethora of runs this weekend.

Sophomore Carly Thea has led the charge

at the plate in conference play for Pitt, hit-

ting a team—leading .429 and recording a '

team-high three stolen bases in ﬁve starts.

tWith the help of fellow sophomore Kaila

Balatgek and freshman Tori Nirschl at the
top of the lineup, those underclassmen will
have to continue to reach base to give the
heavy hitters behind them a shot at batting
them in.  t

The Bulls, who have already played 31
games this season, are currently tied for
second place in the Big East with DePaul,
which has a 7-1 conference record. Notre
Dame is the only remaining unbeaten team
in conference play at 5-0. ’ '

“South Florida went to the College World

Series last year. They have an outstanding
pitching staff, and we need to be ready to
be better —— better at the plate —— and just
continue to set the tone on the mound,” Pitt
head coach Holly Aprile said.

The weekend series marks the beginning
of a ﬁve—garne homestand for Pitt. Following
the USF set, the Panthers will host in—state
rival Penn State in a Wednesday night dou-
bleheader at the Petersen Sports Complex.

Pitt will have to avoid looking too farﬁ:
advance to the Keystone State battle next
week, though, and focus on snapping the
current four-game skid they are on.

A key to which will be doing plenty of
one thing — scoring. H
