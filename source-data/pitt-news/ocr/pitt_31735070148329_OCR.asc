Despitethe countless hours ofprepara—
tion that candidates spend preparing
campaignbanners, T—shirts andﬂiers,
asmallportion ofPittstudents casts its
votes in the annual Student Govem-
ment Board elections.

Each Novemberbrings anew elec-
tion season, butthevotertnumouttends
to remain fairly consistent. The Pitt
News reported tl1atlast year’s election
sawa19 percentvotertumout, relative-
ly comparableto thosefrom2009 and
2008, when12 percentand 19 percent
of students voted, respectively.

Although the SGB Elections Com-
mittee chair Kari Rosenkaimer said
thathercommittee does notkeep pre-
vious voterturnout records on ﬁle, she
has made it her priority to increase

votertumoutto atleastzs percentthis ,
yearforthe Nov. 17 election. The Board"

is the student govemingbody in charge
of allocating more than $2 million in
Student Activities Fee funds.
“Ithinkone ofthe reasons students
choose not to vote is because SGB
hasn’t always beenastransparentas it

hasbeenthisyear;”Rosenkaimersaid. 1

“[SGB President] Molly [Stieber] and
allthe Board members have really done
a greatjob of making SGBwell—known
on campus.”

This election season brings one
more candidate to the playing ﬁeld
than last year’s, with 16 students mm-
ningfor eight Board memberpositions
and two battling it out for the presi-
dency. Rosenkaimer is hopeful that

the added number of candidates will‘

bring more students to the polls this
Thursday.

“I think this year we’re going to
have a really great election, because
there are a lot of candidates running,”

New restaurant, bar opens in Schenley Plaza

Danny Zaidi
Staﬁ” Writer

The construction has ceased at"
Schenley Plaza, and The Porch of-

‘ ﬁcially opened its doors to the Oak-

land community Monday.

The sit- down restaurant and bar,
owned by Eat’n Park Hospitality
Group, joins four food kiosks in the

Plaza across from the Hillman Li— ‘

brary. But unlike the other eateries,
The Porch will stay open year-round
and provide diners indoor seating as
well as outdoor seating options.

The Porch’s menu includes
American cuisine such as salads,
sandwiches and pizza for lunch,
with a larger menu for dinner. The
menu does not reﬂect the usual Eat’n
Park dishes. '

he restaurant also has a liquor
license and will serve alcohol from 11

a.m. until 10 p.m. on weekdays, and

until 11 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays ‘

and 9 p.m. on Sundays. ,

Mark Broadhurst, the director of
concept development for The Porch,
said that the restaurant wasn’t ex-
pecting a large turnout for the early
part of its opening day, since the
managers have kept the unveiling
pretty quiet and haven’t started
marketing. _

“[We’re] just happy to get the
doors open and get some nice ﬂow
through here. So we were, I think,
kind of happy to get the turnout es-
pecially on a rainy day,” Broadhurst
said. -

_Broadhurst and executive chef
Kevin Hermann promised The Porch
will be a speedy lunch stop for a cam-
pus crowd looking for a nice view,
with its wall of garage-door-style

T windows overlooking the Schenley

Plaza lawniq

“The idea is the food — the menu
items — ideally come out in ﬁve to
six minutes. The intention is to get
them in and out quickly,” Broad-
hurst said, noting that he expects
the typical meal will last from 20 to
30 minutes. .

Hermann said that the full-
service menu for dinner includes
rotisserie items such as prime rib,
porchetta, roast chicken, duck legs
and sauteed salmon. V

His favorite menu items are the
brick—oven Bianca pizza and the
porchetta, aslow-roasted pork that
comes from Cunningham Farms in
Indiana, Pa.

Students will likely not have to
break the bank for lunch, but they
do have the option to spend more
money during dinner both for en-
trées from the on-site rotisserie and

‘ at the bar for those 21 and older.

Sandwiches, pizzas and salads

range from $7 to $10, whereas din-
nertime entrees go for $15 to $20.
The Porch does accept Panther
Funds.

Hermann said The Porch might
eventually feature half-price appe-
tizers at night, just like many of the
other restaurants around Oakland.

“We are kicking around a lot of
ideas, so probably after the Thanks-
giving holiday or in December we
will be having a happy hour and also
late food special,” Hermann said.

The Porch is open Monday
through Friday from 11 a.m." to 11
p.m. Saturday and Sunday brunch
starts at 10 a.m., and the restaurant
remains open until 11 p.m. on Satur-
day and 9 p.m. on Sunday.

“Schenley Plaza is such a great,
beautiﬁil space — it looks at the vi-
brancy of Oakland. We really wanted
to focus on the outside rather than
the inside,” Broadhurst said. I

Elections 4 1

Rosenkaimer said.

SGB candidates have communicated their
platfomts to students by speakinginfront ofvari-
ous student organizations, encouraging ﬁiends
and supporters to wear campaignT—shirts and
hanging banners.

“With lowvoter turnouts, every vote matters.
This makes campaigning even more important
for us candidates as we need to ﬁght for every
student’s vote,” Board candidate Scott Blackburn
said. '

Blackburn, running on the Pitt First slate,
has spoken abouthis platform to myriad student
organizations at Pitt. He said he believes that
consistently low voter tumouts are the result of a
large portion of the student body being unaware
of what SGB actually does and how it impacts
students’ experiences at the University.

“I believe campaigning is effective, and that V

it gets candidates’ names out to students who
are going to vote, but I don’t believe campaign-
ing makes a huge difference in the number of

voters,” the junior political science and history

- major said. “In the end,,I feel campaigning will
pay off because it enables us to get our message 4

to the students who do vote.”

Rosenkaimer saidthatto increase votertum--
out this year, she has made efforts to keep the
student body well—inforrned about prospective
candidates and the election process.

In August, the Elections Committee threwan
SGB-ingo nightforfreshmen during orientation
week. Rosenkaimer said that current Board mem-
bers introduced themselves to the group of about

V sooﬁeshmenandspokeabouttheworkthatSGB

does. She said she believes freshmen are now
more educated about the workings of SGB and
hopes that informingnew studentswilltranslate
into a greater voter turnoutthis year.

The Elections Committeehas also puttogether
a nine—minute video to help students 
themselves withallthe candidates and theirideas.
The video —which includes clips fromthe candi-
dates stating who they are, why they’re running
and their three platforms —- is currently being
played on the screens in the Wlliam Pitt Union,

Towers Lobby and the Petersen Events Center.
Despite the best efforts of SGB and its hope-
ﬁils, some Pitt students might still be uninformed
and unwilling to cast their votes on Thursday.
“I don’t really know when [the election] is,”
said Phillip Ferguson, a freshman who does not

plantovote.“Ihaven’tbeenpayingattention,andI '

don’tl<nowwho is init. I’m just not connectedwith
the whole process, but from what I’ve heard, the
Student Government Board is important.”

However, other students plantovote because
of the clear-cut campaigns that candidates have
run so far.

Senior Danielle Grimm said the candidates
have done a good job of making their slates un-

’ derstandable and making themselves available

on campus so that students don’t have to seek
information actively on their own. "
“I think it’s important to vote at the collegiate

Students encouraged to “put out” this week

Gretchen Andersen
Staff Writer

Sean Zajdel can’t stand it when some-
one is smoking in front of him.

“It’s the worst,” the junior said. “I
don’t understand the addiction.”

Zajdel is not alone. It is a common
sight on campus to see students duck
their heads or pass by people in front
of them to avoid the puffs of a cigarette
smoker.

This week marks Tobacco Aware-
ness Week, aweek—long series of activi-
ties devoted to promoting awareness
of the effects of smoking and smoke-
less tobacco. Pitt Student Health Ser-
vices and several student organiza-
tions are co-sponsoring the events,
the ﬁrst ofwhichwas held on Monday
on the William Pitt Union lawn ﬁ‘om

, .n09n,to 1.P-.II_1. .  ._,.  _  _  - _. _. ..
Anna Vitriol, a health educator at

Student Health Services, said that ac-
cording to the 2009 National College
Health Assessment conducted at Pitt,
48.1 percent ofPitt students have used
hookah, 41.2 percent of Pitt students

havesmokedsomeformofcigarettes -

i and 11.9 percent of Pitt students have
used smokeless tobacco. 4
Tobacco use in general, Vitriol said,

  

 
 
  

 

cancause health hazards. '

“Its many detrimental effects
on health are well-established and
include triggering asthma attacks,
causing lung cancer and causing car-
diovascular and other lung diseases,”
Vitriol said.

On Monday, the kickoff event
brought students up to the table on the
WPU lawn where they could receive
wristbands and bright red T—shirts that
read “I hope you put out” on the front
and “  that cigarette” on the back.

Junior Raheel Haque, picked up
one of the free T—shirts. Haque, a
resident assistant who. often talks to

I his_residents about smoking, said he

thinks there are “way to_o many people
smoking on campus.”

Vitriol said one research study
found that the four most common
reasons college students give fortheir

vision, having more free ﬁmeanilthe
number of their ﬁiends who smoke.
“In fact, many college students

report that they often use smoking .

as a means of controlling stress and/
or depression,” she said.

Vitriol said second—hand smoke,
also known as environmental to—_
bacco smoke, is classiﬁed as a Class
A carcinogen. She said that there is

“signiﬁcant” evidenceto support that
second—hand smoke is harmful to non-
smokers as well as smokers.

Unfortunately, Vitriol acknowl-
edged that avoiding second—hand
smokeis “ineffective” in enclosed
spaces or outside entrance areas and
sidewalks. A

“Smoke can easily travel through
open doors, through heating and air
circulation vents. People must walk

From noon to 3 p.m. on Tuesday,
PantherWELL, Stress-Free Zone and
Tobacco Free Allegheny will set up
information tables in Towers Lobby.
Tobacco Free Allegheny, a local non-
proﬁt thatworks to provide awareness
about the use of tobacco, will present
an age—progression demonstration.

sions, which outline steps students
can take to stop using tobacco. The
program is sponsored by Office of

V Health Education and Promotion at

Student Health Services, according

to the Student Healthwebsite.

Vitriol said the QUIT program is
six weeks long and offers participat-
ing students two weeks worth of free
nicotine patches. The sessions are one-
on—one with a graduate—level intern
and the student.

On Thursday from 4 to 6 p.m. in
Towers Lobby, PantherWELL will
sponsor the Great American Smoke-
out — a national event sponsofed
by the American Cancer Society that
encourages smokers to quit smoking

on Nov. 17 or set a quit date.

Vitriol said that students will learn
about tobacco—related topics they
might never have known about before,
such as the dangers of hookah.

“One hour of smoking hookah is
equivalent to 100 cigarettes,” Vitriol
said.

EDITORIAL ”

Eliild sex abuse

bill insufficient

' Recent events at Penn State have

caused many different reactions.
People from all over -— and es-
pecially.Pen’nsylvanians —— are
discussing the issue ad nauseam,
examining people’s legal and
moral obligations, as well as the
fall from grace of an administra-

tion, football program and local’

hero. —

But in New York, there’s been
a legislative reaction that comes
just days after former Penn State
President Graham Spanier and
head football coach Joe Paterno
were ﬁred for failing to tell police
about a credible report of child
sex abuse on campus.

The New York bill would make

such inactions illegal. It would

require college coaches, athletic
directors, administrators and
professors to report child sex
abuse to the police. If passed,
the bill would add these college
employees to a list that already
places these obligations on- high
school teachers, physicians and
coaches.

It’s very clear that this bill
comes in reaction to the events
that unfolded at Penn State last
week. And We think that’s ﬁne,
and it’s good to look for a solid
solution. But we also think it’s just
too narrowly constructed to be
effective. , ‘

By addressing child sex abuse
on college campuses, the bill miss-
es the mark. Its aim appears to be

' very focused but, after a closer

look, it seems like it’s trying to
score political points. By narrow-

ing the bill to only include these. '

college employees, how effective
would it really be in preventing
child sex abuse and bringingjus-
tice to those involved?

The smaller issue of reporting
child sex abuse should not neces-
sarily be the focus of this ordeal.
The actual crime is a much bigger
problem, and that’s where the fo-
cus needs to be. By addressing the
child sex abuse itself, legislation
would be much more effective. 4

For instance, lawmakers might
look into nonproﬁts that work
with children and examine how
they operate and work from the
inside out. And at colleges, where
sexual abuse often runs rampant,
there need to be institutional rules,
about conduct when it comes to
minors. _

Something as heinous as child
sex abuse requires a lot more
work than a tunnel-visioned bill
that only addresses the residual
problem after abuse takes place.
According to The Philadelphia
Inquirer, though, Pennsylvania
state lawmakers predict the in-
troduction and passage of simi-
lar legislation. We hope future
abuse—related bills will be effec-

» tive, precise and broader in their

language. I -

The sex abuse scandal at Penn
State —— and the alleged cover-
up that imbues it all —— is a sad
statement on the priorities of
institutions of higher education.
We’re glad lawmakers are conven-
ing in response to sucha tragedy
coming to light, but the nation
needs more efficient protocol if it
wants to prevent institutionalized
wrongdoing.

In the meantime, we just have
to -wish there wouldn’t be a need
for a law like this in the first place.
In a better world, people wouldn’t

‘wait for the long arm of the law
to direct them to do the right ,

thing. I

Has this ever happened to you? You
meet a cool person, start texting him
or her, and then something totally
out of the ordinary happens:

i u: hey sup

umewfriend: Hi there! I’m at a
slam poetry event right now. What
are you doing?

Ohdear God, what do you say
to this? Do you tell this person the‘
truth: that you’ve been managing
your Cleveland Browns dynasty in
Madden 2012 for the better part of
the past 48 hours? No way; ‘she’ll
think you’re a complete loser. Just
play it cool and buy some time:

u: nmjus chillin u

You dodged a bullet there. But

‘~ Wait: '

urnewﬁiend: Well, as I just wrote,

I’m attending a slam poetry event. ‘
_ Maybe you’d like to come to one with

me. They’re very “chill,” so if you’re
as into “just chilling” as your text
indicates, you’ll have a great time.
No, a thousand times no! A po-
etry slam‘? Is this person “straight
tripping”? You haven’t even taken
the plastic seal off those CD-bundled
textbooks you bought months ago

(and you’re justiﬁed in refusing to
unwrap them, since doing so would
reduce their resale value). Well 
maybe there’s-a way you can salvage
this awkward situation and get on
his or her good side. Let’s try a dif-
ferent tactic:

u: sounds cool i’m workin on a
short story right now

umewfriend: Awesome! I’d love
to read it!

How about that? You’ve caught
this person’s attention,’which is fan-
tastic. What isn’t so fantastic is that
he orshe has expressed an interest in
reading the story you’ve claimed that
you’re writing. Now it appears that
you’re going to have to type some-
thing longer than a hottext like “jus
chillin” or “sup,” a terrifying even-
tuality you thought you’d avoided

by crafting a schedule of “blow—off ”

lecture classes where the overworked
instructors didn’t assign papers.

Fortunately for you, we’re here to
help. We’ve written thousands of sto-
ries, so assisting you with the story
of your dreams won’t be a problem.
Before we begin, though, commit
these principles to memory:

1. When writing a short story,
keep it very short. Squib—length, tops.
Ever notice how any news article that
requires scrolling down or clicking to
a second or —— heaven forbid — third
page is “tl;dr”? Exactly. And given

Danielle Ha I Staff Illustrator

how action-packed this upcoming
college basketball season is likely to
be, it’s doubtful that anyone will have
time to read anything besides his or
her fantasy team’s statistics.

2. The best authors write about
what they know. This is why former
lawyer John Grisham writes about
lawyers, former wizardJ.K. Rowling
writes about wizards, former vam-
pire Stephenie Meyer writes about
vampires, and former pizza magnate
Herman Cain writes about why 45 is
his lucky number.

2 3-. The only difference between
“best-selling” ﬁction and “literary”
ﬁction is that the latter contains way
more references to esoteric colors
and ﬂowers. If you’re going to write
“literary” ﬁction, you’ll need to be
unafraid to describe the cyan, ochre,
Vermilion, chartreuse, fuchsia and
perhaps even aubergine shades of
every petal on every begonia, orchid,
marigold, wisteria and chrysanthe—
mum in the cemetery where the main
character’s abusive father is buried.

Got it? Good, because it’s time to
start typing. Since it’s probably been
ages since you’ve written anything
longer than a hot text, we’ll just write
this thing for you. Even though this-
is a short story rather than a play,
we’re going to work from the 5—act
dramatic structure laid out in Gustav

Freytag’s “Die Technik des Dramas.”
First, the exposition, where we in-
troduce our main character and the
problem that he faces:

Haden Braden was a pretty cool
bro who wore Ed Hardy shirts that
were tight around the arms and loose
around the stomach. His fave baller
was Kevin Love and his main man in
Madden 2012 was Peyton Hillis. He
really wanted to get with this one
girl he knew.

Man, doesn’t Haden Braden
sound awesome? In addition to hav-

.'ing a name that’s really popular right ‘

now, he’s as relatable as they come.
Now for the rising action, where
the main problem — HB’s desire to
get with this one girl he knows —— is
made more difficult by the addition
of various secondary conflicts:

Maybe they could hangfor a little
bit, he thought. However, he needed
to ﬁnish his fantasy football waiver
wire deals before the games this
weekend. Also, some of his home-
boys wanted to come over and “get
their drink on.”

Poor Haden Braden! With so
much to do, will he ever be able to
get with the girl he knows? We’ll ﬁnd
out in the climax to this masterpiece-
in-the-making:

. Haden Braden decided he would
get up before noon to do some of this
stuff. He actually woke up at 12:30,
which was still solid. After he picked
up Dez Bryant and Sam Bradford off
the waiver wire, he sent the girl he
knew a hot text: “sup wanna hang?”
“Yah sure,” she wrote back afew sec-
onds later.

Whew! Seemed like he wasn’t
going to make it, huh? Talk about
a cliffhanger — but thankfully our
bro HB managed to dig deep and ﬁnd

‘ the right words. We’re approaching

the resolution, although the falling
action that ‘precedes it will be no
less breathtaking than what came
before:

Haden Braden tried to clean up
the huge piles of garbage around his
place while he waited for the girl to
arrive. He knew his bros would be
over later, too. If the girl was still
there, maybe she could hang with
them as well. '

of the backward baseball cap that

Facebook good news source  

Elizabeth Weisel-
Columnist

It’s been said that no news is good
news, but I’d say that any news is
better than no news. In a society
that relies on at least a basic knowl-
edge of current events, we can’t af-
ford to be uninformed — even if our
information comes from a source
like Facebook. ,
According to Facebook statis-
tics, the site currently hosts more
than 800 million users, and more
than 50 percent of those users log
on every day. And every day millions
of users post millions of words and
pictures and links to communicate
information to the other millions
of users. —
When scrolling through your
news feed on your Facebook

, homepage, you bombard yourself

with news. From posted links about
international news to personal up-
dates from your friends, the news
is conveniently listed in one acces-
sible source to be seen at any given
moment. -
Hitwise analyst Heather Hop-
kins reports that Facebook was the
fourth—largest source of trafﬁc to
news and media websites behind
Google, Yahoo and MSN, at 3.52
percent.]ohn Hudson reported for
The Atlantic Wire that by December
2009 Facebook reached 193 million
page views, which was almost as
much as Yahoo and MSN combined.
If the trend continues, Facebook

Whereas Facebook isn’t by
deﬁnition a news source, it both
provides news and directs its us-
ers to news and media websites.
Facebook operates as an effective
news‘ provider because of its con-
venience and personal signiﬁcance
to its readers. .

Especially as college students,
we frequently log on to Facebook
and check our notiﬁcations or scan
our news feed for updates. It’s un-
necessaryifor usto logon to a news"
website or turn on the TVwhen we’
can just watch news stories break

on Facebook through updated sta— A

tuses and- posted materials. When
your friends ﬁnd the most pertinent
or thought—provoking articles for
you, there is no need to search for
your own information anymore.
We would much rather spend our
time watching “The Office” than
the news, or doing the Sudoku than
scanning the headlines.

Even if we do not use Facebook A

to get our ﬁll of news, we frequently

employ it to be aware of breaking .

news. For example, when Presi-
dent Barack Obama was elected or
when Osama bin Laden was killed,
the news was in almost every Fa-

cebook status. Within a few days, i

there were still articles and news
media pages pertinent to the events
being conveniently posted foryou

to peruse.

We are’ more willing to accept
news from a social networking site
because of the personal connec-
tion that is associated with it. When
a news article or video is posted,
we automatically pair that piece of
information with the person who

and whatever we know about him.
Especially if there are comments
made on the piece, a posted news
story can inspire much discussion
about issues.

But Facebook doesn’t only
spread international and national
news. It is also our main source for
news about our friends and families,
and even the people we don’t know
well at all. Whether it’s information
about a friend’s new romance or an

When we get the news from Fa-
cebook, we are also ﬁltering our
news through the opinions of our
friends and peers. While that can
limit our sources, it can also focus
the information to our personal
preferences. The stories shared
usually come from friends whose
opinions we trust.

_ In some regard, it could be
dangerous to rely ona social net-
working site like Facebook for news
information if only biased sources
are presented or you don’t ﬁnd the
whole story. But I think that it has
proved more useful than harmful.

In college, we have Very little
time or will to read the newspaper
or watch the news on a regular ba-
sis. But this is also the most vital
time‘ in our lives for us to be aware
of what is going on i-n the world
around us, both in our immediate
bubble and internationally. It is bet-
ter to get our news from Facebook
than from nowhereat all.

Occupy movement comparable to Tea Party

Brian Dollard and Dan Law
Staff Writers

This is the second in an ongoingseries
on the Occupy Pittsburgh movement;
an offshoot of the Occupy Wall Street
protest. ‘-

As it enters its third month, ques— 

' tions regarding Occupy Wall Street’s
methods and ﬁmire remain prevalent
as the organization gains complexity.

 

Its local olfshoot, Occupy Pittsburgh
— currently in its second month oc-
cupying Mellon Green Downtown —
faces posterity issues similartothose of
its brother groups in cities throughout
the world. -

Theprotesters’ collective voice
continues to cry outagainstcorporate
greedand government corruption. The
movement reminds many of adifferent
set ofpolitical activists —— onethatper-
haps encompasses part ofthe opposite

side ofthe political and social spectrum:

the Tea Party.

TheTeaPartyevolvedﬁ*omamove
ment spurred by socioeconomic dis-
content to a  force in national
politics. Theirorganizationalfounding
and solidiﬁcation provides the Occupy
movement with a recent example of
howasocial movementcansuccessfully

sustainitselfin politics.

But the two social protest groups
diiferin many of their views and align-

ments with existing groups. This sug-
gests that the Occupy movement will
not follow in the Tea Pa1ty’s footsteps.

As for the protesters, the Occupy
Piusburgh movement is slowly reach-
inga crossroads that has led some Oc-
cupiersto consider establishingoccupy
Pittsburgh as a nonproﬁt or as abeneﬁ—
ciary of ﬁscal sponsorship.

The Mellon Green group is now split
over whether or not to combine with
existing political groups.

“Join or Die”

Similar to Occupy Pittsburgh, the
Tea Party rallied against its members’
perceived lack of voice within the gov-
emment starting in 2009.

that spread rather rapidly —- but it
seems like the parallels might end right
there. The Tea Party movement, after
it got going, became very well-ﬁrnded.

_p First corporate interests ﬁieled the '

the Republican Partystarted organizing
candidates,” Victor said.

Victor doubted that the Occupy
movement will follow the Tea Party’s
path, saying that the movement’s mo-
tives are unclear. Occupy lacks the
money ﬁom corporate sponsorship

. that has helped fund the Tea Party.

At a similar crossroads, the Tea
Party chose the reinforcement route,
Victor said. The group decided to join

VlCt0I‘ said that she’s not sure that
the Occupy movement’sgrievanceswill
resonate with the Democratic Party
as the campaign season continues to

unfold. Some have speculated that the
Democratic Partywill come to focus on
some of Occupy’s central issues, includ-
ing income disparity.

“It’s unclear if the Democratic Party
will take advantage of the energy in
the Occupy movement and use that to
recruit candidates and fold it into the

Greed is Good

Pitt sociology professor Suzanne
Staggenborg said there is a speciﬁc dif-
ference between the Tea Party and the
Occupy Movement— one thatfocuses
on the aspect of greed.

The OccupyPittsburghwebsite1ink

~ reads, “Occupy Pittsburgh: Standing

Together Against Corporate Greed.”

“The Occupy movements are con-
cerned with corporate greed /and gov-

ernment corruption. The TeaPartyisn’t

talkingaboutcorporate greed Greedis
ﬁne for them,” Staggenborg said.
Melissa Haluszczak —- the Repub-
lican Tea Party candidate who plans to
run for Congress against incumbent
Rep.  Doyle (D-Pa.) — said that
those within the Occupy movement
often confuse the terms “corporate
greed” and “corporate welfare,” and
thattheTeaPartyisagainstdoingthings
solely motivated bygreed. ,
“Greed isn’t bad unless you are a
glu_ttonaboutit,” saidHaluszczak. “The
Tea Party is absolutely against doing
things for greed itself.” She explained
thatshe opposes corporate welfare, like

federal bailouts ofbanks.

The Tea Party candidate extended
the deﬁnition of greed, explaining that
the concept isn’t necessarily bad if ap-
plied in moderation.

“Corporate greed iswhafs goingto
push the corporations to innovate, to
become better, to grow and hire more
people. [Corporate greed] hasbecome
anevilphrase. Greed iswhenacorpora-
tion is‘ stepping on its employees, when

it’s crushing other corporations under _

Despite Haluszczak’s comments on
the Occupiers’ philosophy, the Tea Party
candidate admitted seeing a connec-

ward. “We want people to cooperate
-— that’s the only way We’re goingto get
the 99 percent involved,” he said.

Working the System

It is hard to determine the actual
success of the Tea Party movement in
terms of policy outcomes — the debt
ceiling debate over the course of the
summer certainly pitted the newly
minted Republican representatives
against the Democrats with mixed re-
sults.Nonetheless, the electoral gains
of the Tea Party are measurable and
numerous after its alliance with the
Republican Party.

As of the most recent update "on
their website, the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives’ Tea Party Caucus, founded
in2010, contained 60 members,allRe-
publicans. Seventeenofthose members
were electedinthezolo election cycle.
Thefounderofthe caucus, Rep. Michele
Bachmann (R—Minn.), is seeking the
GOP nomination alongside other Tea

Party-supported candidates, such as"

Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) and former
CEO of Godfather’s Pizza Herman
Cain.

And those only representthe  -

on the federal level of government for
the Tea Party. The group is prevalent

in local and state politics around the
United States.

Currently, the Occupiers in Pitts-
burgh aren’t moving toward party af-
ﬁliation or forming their own party.
But they are looking for other ways to
sustain the movement by using Pitts-
burgh’s nonproﬁt community. '

Inastatementposted onthe Google
group page for Occupy Pittsburgh’s
Food working group on Oct. 27, the
group in charge of donations said that
an infusion of cas “is an absolute ne-
cessity if the camp is to survive.” As
a solution, Occupy Pittsburgh might
exploit a technicality in the tax code
called“ﬁscal_sponsorship.”This process
would channel tax-cleductible funds to
Occupy Pittsburgh through an estab-
lished nonproﬁt. . .

The statement also said that there
is an internal movement looking to
create a sponsorship arm of Occupy
Pittsburgh. This arm of the movement
would apply to the IRS as a nonproﬁt
under 501(c)(3) status.

More recently, there have been
meetings within Occupy Pittsburgh
to discuss whether or not the move-
ment should seek ﬁscal sponsorship

- through the Thomas Merton’ Center;

a Pittsburgh social justice nonproﬁt.
Some protesters believe that the Mer-

ton Center’s ﬁnancial relationship with
PNC bank runs contrary to the move-
ment’s principles.

Lawson — a member of the State-
ment, Hospitality and Facilitation
working groups — conﬁrmed that Pitt-
burgh’s Occupiers are discussingﬁscal
sponsorship. But “it is still an ongoing
conversation,” he said, ﬁirther noting
thatthe movement “still hasn’tﬁgured
out all of the details.”

Lawson said he wants to focus on
the core needs ofthe movement. Elabo-
ratingﬁirther, he said that restructuring
Occupy Pittsburghas anonproﬁtstands
againstwhatthe movementis tryingto
achieve.‘ ‘Granted, We’re kind ofmagray
area right now in regards to organiza-
tional structure. We’re notan organiza-
tion by any means, we’re a movement.
We have no hierarchy. In order to apply
for501(c)(3) status, you haveto have an
organizational structure. Implementing
ourselves as a nonproﬁt organization is
completely against what we stand for
here,” Lawson _said. i

As the protests around the U.S. and
the world enter their third month, ob-
servers wait to see how this grassroots
movementwill deliver on its message:
either through the political or nonproﬁt
systems or by remaining outside of all

Panthers look to regroup against Saint Francis  

Dustin Gabler
Staﬁ Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team
will look to pickup its ﬁrst win
of the season against the Saint
Francis Red Flash Tuesday after
falling in its season opener to
Hampton.

Despite being in the smaller
Northeast Conference, the Red

, 5 Flash will bring a talented team to

the Petersen Events Center. Saint
Francis went 22-12 last season,
when it logged a victory over the
Panthers. The Red Flash have won
the Northeast Conference for the

past two seasons and were the fa-
vorites to do so again in the con-
ference’s head coaches’ poll. 5 _
The Red Flash are coming off
a 74-70 defeat at the hands of
Duquesne butshowed some prom-

‘ _ ise late in the game after starting

off slow. Offensively, the team is
led by sophomore forward Alli
Williams and junior guard Rhon-
da Watts. Against —Duquesne, the
two combined for 39_points. Also
scoring in double digits for the
Flash were Pennsbury graduate
Sarah Thorn, with 12 points, and
freshman guard Alexa Hayward,
with 15. - . ’
Pitt head coach Agnus Bere-

nato knows that ‘Saint Francis is
a quality opponent for her, young
team, and she cannot let her play-
ers dwell on the disappointment
of losing their ﬁrst game. -

“I just think that today they got
a dose of reality of what it is re-
ally like,” Berenato said after the
Hampton loss. “We’ll be back at
it in the morning for practice and
then practice again on Monday,
and then we face another really
good NCAA tournament veteran
team, Saint Francis.”

The Panthers boast a squad of
six freshmen and six sophomores,
making them the youngest Wom-
en’s Division I basketball team

Panthers dominate, get first conference Win

 

Dexter Gulick
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s and women’s swim
teams got their ﬁrst in—conference
wins of the season when they
trounced the Cincinnati Bearcats
Friday night at Trees Pool.

The wins gave both Panther
teams an important in—conference
victory, one that they hope can
propel them back towardthe top
of the conference standings. Both
teams were led by standout indi-
vidual performances on their way
to the wins.

The men’s team won all 16 events
in which they competed, ﬁnishing

\ l, with a lopsided 237-60 victory over

the Bearcats. On the women’s side,
juniors Joanna Budzis and Kelsey
Herbst brought home ﬁrst-place ﬁn-
ishes on the way to a 217-82 team
victory. ' .-

‘- —‘ Herbst earned aﬁrst-place ﬁnish

in the women’s 500-yard free, with a
4:59.58 time. In a rare occasion, she
also swam the 100—yard freestyle,

‘ coming .84 seconds off her best time
with a 53.89.

“I had a little break last night,” p

Herbst said Saturday evening. “It’s
kind of nice to do the 100-yard
free.” A

She also took home the gold in

the 200-yard, free with a 1:53.21,

‘which was also an in-season best

time.
“Coach wanted to see what I

could do when I was fresh by not

swimmingthe 1,000 before the 200
free,” Herbst said.

Covering for her in the 1,000-
yard freestyle was sophomorejulie
Harrison, who won the event with
a time of 10:19.36. Teammates Kate

Dunseith (10:32.88) and Emily Bolek
(10:40.98) took second and third to
round out the sweep in the grueling,
40—length race. '

The sprint group of the women’s
team (2-3, 1-2 Big East), led by fresh-
man Dani des Tombe, also cruised
to an easy victory over the Bearcat
women (1-3, 0-3 Big East) with a
ﬁnal score of 217-82. Des Tombe
placed ﬁrst in the 50-yard freestyle

(24.14) and second in the 100-yard
freestyle (52.34) '
“We are so young on the women’s

side, but they’re coming around-

like you can’t believe,” head coach
Chuck Knoles said. “The things that
we were not very good at last week,
two weeks ago —— our pull—outs and
our starts —- we’ve cleaned those up.
They looked really sharp tonight.”
Junior Budzis swept up the worn-

 

en’s 100- and 200-yard backstroke,

I withtimes of 57.28 and 2:01.82,ire-

spectivelyi’ Sophomore Veronica Lee

‘took the 200-yard breaststroke with

a 2:18.29 and the 100—yard ﬂy with
3 57.25. .

The meet was a good showcase of
talent, according to Knoles. The pre-
vious two meets, both losses, were
against Big East powerhouses Notre

Dame and Louisville. The Irish have ’
15 more men on their roster than

Pitt, and the Cardinals ﬁeld 13 more
than the Panthers. The Cincinnati
men’s team (0-4, 0-3 Big East) had
only three more swimmers.

“Ifwas a much more even meet ‘

number—wise,” Knoles said. “Their
guys had to swim as many events as

our guys had to swim, for both the

men and women.” .
The men’s team (2-3, 1-2’ Big East)

won handedly. The Panthers won

every single men’s event, swept the

Bearcats in ﬁve events, -and ended .

with aﬁnal score of 237-60. The Pan-
thers were especially dominant in
the 400—yard medley relay, posting
an incredible 3:21.83. That relay is
ranked eighth best in the nation.

“I did not expect us to gothat fast

in the medley relay,” Knoles said. “I ‘

expected us to be in the 3:24-range.
Forus to go 3:21 at this point of the

season, before we’ve even rested — ‘

that’s a great time.’-’

slowing down,
improving offense

Basketball < 12

Panthers will need more offen-

sive production to pick up the win,

Tuesdaynight. Freshman guard
Brianna Kiesel knows the shots
were there, but the team just failed
to get them to go through.

“We rushed in offense and
had good looks, but we just had a
little bit of trouble knocking down
shots,” Kiesel said_. “Like Coach B
said, we just have to go back to the
drawing board.”

Sophomore guard Asia Logan
echoed the sentiment, saying the
young team just needs to calm
down and play basketball the way
they have been taught.

“We just really need to relax

and run our plays,” Logan said.
“The points are there, but we were
just rushing.”

Berenato is looking to see her
team continue to gain experience.
Part of that experience comes
from playing against NCAA Tour-
nament-caliber teams, especially
because the Big East schedule will
deal the Panthers the same level
of competition during the bulk 0

their schedule. ‘ ‘

“We like this team, and we

l\/’l.-n*q'Liel D;-wi:. tlrixresa; to the Lme zlgainr-;i. llaxnptrm on Szltiiniay

are “excited about this team, we
just have to keep progressing,”
Berenato said. “We have a great
schedule and are going to be
playing some NCAA Tournament
teams right in the beginning, be-
cause that is who we are going
to be playing come January and
February. So we need to go at it
now and_not sugarcoat it.”

The schedule doesn’t get any
easier for the Panthers. Pitt has
three games in six days -- a stretch

-that could prove difficult for the

untested players, who haven’t yet
become accustomed to playing to-

. gether. Berenato knows her team

was dealt a difficult schedule, but
she plans to approach it as a learn-
ing experience for the squad.

“We need competition. They‘
. need to get used to the lights. I

would much rather have back-
to-back games,” Berenato said.
“With a veteran team, you would

_be able to do ﬁlm and scout, but

it’s not about that right now. We

' have to do what is best for us, and

right now it is about the speed and

A GRAIN OF SAUL

What you missed last week _

Isaac‘ Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

While the Penn State child abuse
scandal dominated the head-
lines for the last week, the rest
of the sports world didn’t hit the
brakes.

Hidden on the sidebars and
second pages were a few inter-
esting sports stories that ﬂew
under the radar — so in case you
were absorbed byjerry Sandusky
and all that came with him, here
is a little update on what you
missed.

Wilson Ramos is kid-
napped

In one of the most interesting
and horrifying stories the MLB
has seen in years, the Washington
Nationals’ 24-year-old catcher
Wilson Ramos was kidnapped

at gunpoint from his home in —

Venezuela.

, ‘The story is straight out ofla
Hollywood blockbuster. Ramos
was standing outside his home
with his father and two broth-
ers when an. SUV with armed
men pulled up and whisked him
away. What ensued was a two-

day, 200-person police search.

through the backcountry of Ven-
ezuela. After a shootout that last-
ed ﬁfteen minutes, Ramos was
found hiding on the floor of a
room in the captors’ home.

As a gesture to the community,

Ramosplans to stay in Venezuela _

and play in at least one game with
the Aragua Tigers, his Venezu-
elan team, before returning to
Washington for training.

The kidnapping is a remind- \

er of the liberties that many
American athletes hold and do
not share with their foreign
counterparts. Stories of Major
League Baseball players’ families
and friends being kidnapped for
ransom pop up every few years.
Even in Russia, there have been
horror tales of maﬁa members
extorting NHL hockey players.
Fortunately, Ramos is safe and
all but four of a large group of
men involved in his kidnapping
have been apprehended.

Tiger Woods ﬁnishes third
at the Australian Open

Tiger Woods hasn’t made a
headline for anything good in a
while, but this was a start. After
finishing third at the Australian
Open, Woods moved up in the
Official World Golf Ranking for
the first time in seven months.
He is now ranked 50"‘.

"The high ﬁnish, coming on

the heels of the Sandusky case, .

brought an interesting thought:
Maybe Woods’ game will improve
while America’s focus moves to
a new villain. Suddenly cheat-
ing on your wife doesn’t seem
so bad in comparison to child
molestation.

‘ My guess? Woods hasfound
his stroke and will be back on

‘ the podium before you know it.

I never thought his career was
over, and I still don’t. Perhaps
one of the sports world’s darkest
hours will cause the rebirth of
one of its greatest golfers.

The Raiders and Chargers

themselves back in the AFC play-
off race.

NBA season on the verge of -.
cancellation

In one of sports most promi-
nent displays of greed and self-
centeredness, the NBA lockout
reached a new low point over the
last week.

The players have begun to
disband their union, making the
possibility of not having a season
much greater.

The move came after David

Stern made an ultimatum—type fi-s

nal offer, leaving the players with
little choice. According to union
executive director Billy Hunter,
the anti-trust action the players
plan to ﬁle against the NBA is the

“best situation where players can

get their due process.”

. dal itself, the backlash from

Thursday night football
started in 2006, and it is one of
the best ideas the NFL has ever
had. Since its conception, there
have been 41 televised games on
Thursday night. a .

Part of its appeal is that it only
starts halfway through the sea-
son. For me, it just makes it feel

like the weekend before it is the ’
' weekend —- an unbelievably nice

way to end the school day. —

On Thursday, Carson Palmer

of football in a long time as he
threw for two touchdowns and

public and internal uproar on

developments. ,_

The CEO of Sandusky’s The
Second Mile organization has
quit, Joe Paterno’s name has
been removed from the Big Ten
championship trophy, and Mike
McQueary has been put on ad-
ministrative leave. "

While the story of the victims '
is much greater than sports, Penn
State football will surely play a
role in the healing process for the
campus and the athletes in Happy
Valley. We can only hope some »
of the victims can find-solace in
the weeks, months and years to

stroke (2:07.36). Freshman Kourosh Ahani
won the men’s 100—yard butterﬂy, posting
a 50.16. V .

The anchor of the relay, senior Jake Van
Roekel, went on to win both the 50- and the
100—yard freestyle with times of 21.27 and a
46.57, respectively. But in the 400—yard med-
ley, sophomore Alexander Rodenkirk stole
the show with a 45.94 split.

“The way that we did it, we didn’t even
have our fastest freestyler on the end of the
‘A’ relay,” Knoles said. “Van Roekel anchored
it, but Roedenkirk was faster this week on
the ‘B’ relay.” 1’

That’s not the only controversy with the
relay. There’s an ongoing battle between se-
nior Solari and sophomore Rob Power for
the breaststroke slot. The two have been ﬂip-
ﬂopping back and forth over who swims the
second leg of the relay.

ing into,” Knoles said. “And they don’t help
me out at all because one or the other always
ends up swimming faster than the other one
when you put the one in the relay.”

And soon, Knoles says, there could‘ be
another contender for the position on the
relay. ' ‘

“My guess is that [Luke] Nosbisch is going
to be in there real soon,” Knoles said. “His
speed is coming around really fast. He’s never
lifted weights before. He’s ﬁnally going to start
resting, and he’s going to be blazing.”

Despite the competitiveness to earn a
place on the relay, the rivalries always remains
friendly.

“It’s ﬁerce when the gun goes off to race,

a butwe correct each other’s strokes at practice,”

Solari said. “We help each other because we are
