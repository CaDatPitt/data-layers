Interfraternity Loan
And Scholarship Fund
Established by IFC

By NANCY FUCHS

The Office of Student and General Affairs has approved
an Interfraternity Loan and Scholarship Fund slated to go
into effect this trimester. The original proposal was passed
by Interfraternity Council (IFC) at the close of the winter
trimester. ‘

The fund will operate primarily as a short-term, emer-
gency loan fund at ﬁrst. But:1Parker Enwright, assistant
dean of men, predicts that it “could 'éasily.~~amount to $1,000
by Christmas-” 3:}? 33:1 2‘f{’;i “ is : .

“Within ﬁve years, when the plan ”mat'if1_res, scholarships
ranging from -$250 to $1,000 should total $2,000 or more,” according to
Enwright. Then graduate fellowships and international scholarships
may be granted. 7 ’ 

Financial backbone of the fund will be a contribution of one
dollar per trimester from each fraternity member and pledge. Other
sources which will “at least equal or possibly double fraternity con-
tributions,” according to Enwright, include a $1,000 bond which was
purchased when the fraternities closed down during World War II,
and ﬁnes levied by IFC.

Also included are funds held in trust in surplus accounts
which can be borrowed for loans, and donations from companies
like Balfour, which have contracts with fraternities.

Demanding personal emergencies will head the list of priority
ﬁnancial needs. In the following order are listed: essential education-
al expenses, such as tuition and room and board; educationally
related expenses, including fraternity dues; initiation fees, and miscel-
laneous personal expenses.

Loans will be made only to full-time students in good stand-
ing with their fraternities-. Amounts may range from $10 to $100,
usually to be repaid in six months or less. Loans can be made for
periods as long as one year in exceptional cases. If funds become
limited in the beginning, loans will be made in proportion to the
amount that a fraternity has contributed, according to Enwright.

Ewery loan will be secured by promisory note, and minors may
be required to obtain co—signers. A parent or guardian must co-sign
all loans to minors for initiation fees. A service charge of two per
cent per year will be imposed on a loan made for more than 31 days.

SG Unanimously Supports

Student Textbook Discount i

ByFR.EDFRANK

Student Government unanimously passed a resolution‘ that the Book Store “grant
a reasonable discount” to all full time graduate and undergraduate students for the pur-
chase of textbooks and school supplies, at Thursday's meeting.

Senator Martin Engels, who proposed he resolution stated that 2,300 University

students had signed petitions favoring the bill.

SG President John Vrana urged pass age of the resolution because the bill would
“engender a lot of support for Student Government from the student body. The 2,300
signatures tell us they want this. You are under an obligation to give this to the peo-

ADDRESSING a meeting of Student Government, Marty Engels dis-
cusses the progress of petitions recently circulated to reduce taxes
on textbooks and obtain student discounts in the Book Center. Stu-
dent interest in such matters was evident from the large number of
signatures collected.

As Dubow Bows

_ By BARRY SHAW

An extremely enthusiastic audience greeted Marilyn
Dubow on Thursday at the Student Union PM Series. Miss
Dubow performed exceedingly well for it, demonstrat-
ing her range of ability by moving from the classicism of
Mozart through the spirituality of Beethoven and Brahms,
to the utter sensuality of Debussy, with all the skill of a
great virtuoso. Yet Miss Dubow did all this in such an as-
surmng manner that no one failed to be impressed.

Showing consistent understanding of her material

throughout the evening. Miss Dubow performed exceed-
ingly well on the sonatas of Beethoven and Brahms. In the

Beethoven, she played powerfully where the music called for it, and-

tenderly, in a complete reversal of mood, where that was expected.
The rapport between Miss Dubow and her accompanist, Bela Szilingi,
was well demonstrated in the scherzo of this work, when the violinist
had to immediately follow the pianist in many intricate rhythms. In
performing the Brahms, Miss Dubow brought out the most subtle
emotions, while maintaining a ﬂowing quality, a task well-executed

and usually lacking in performances of this type.

Evening Highlight

The highlight of the evening, however, was works by Debussy
and a work by Bloch. In the Debussy, Miss Dubow had the audience
completely under her spell as she performed with a lyricism and
grace that blended perfectly with the music. Even her whole body
Seemed to ﬂow with the charms of Debussy, and the insight that she
showed into the composerand his works would be difficult to duplicate.

 - Much the" same effect was evident in the work 'by Bloch. Miss
Dubow created such an aura within the audience, that -at the
°l°5° °f this beautiful Work. the audience had to pause for an
instant before applauding. '

And ﬁnally, Miss Dubow proved that her technical proﬁcience
matched her spiritual insight, as she gave a ﬂawless performance of
the Scherzo Tarantelle by Wieniawski. The technical obstades in
this piece were many, and Miss Dubow glided through them with the
grace and ease that characterized every one of her performances. The
audience was so impressed with this, her ﬁnal -work, that they called
her back for an_en_core.:~_ . . g -  » w , e

    

ple who elected you.”' ,

The next step, according to“

SG President Vrana, will be that
he will present the resolution to
Lawrence L. Monnett, Jr., Assist-
ant Chancellor for Business Af-

fairs, and John Bologna, manager 

of the Book Center.

Vrana will inform them of “the B it

sentiment expressed at the meet-

ing and urge that they take :’
favorable action on the resolu- ' ‘

tion.” _
At the same meeting a. reso-
lution proposed by Senator
John Dugan concerning student,
integrity was passed. Senators
Jack Koury and Feme Pitt
both questioned what Senator
Dugan meatn by his proposal
to gather background in-
formation." ' .
At Presid'ent Vrana’s sugges-
tion the SG decided it would be
most feasible to issue a statement
concerning student integrity to

the student body and that this‘

would be the purpose of the reso-
lution. ,
The senate elected Naomi Hoff-

man to ﬁll the senate vacancy

from the school of Liberal Arts.

ported on the basis of her various

By JIM DALGLISH
The Autumn issue of Ideas and Figures has
‘made the scene—-an odd mixture of the grotesque
, and the lucid, of mystiﬁ-cation and searching rea-
. sonableness. At times one feels penetrated by the
- issue, at times one does not penetrate. That is
. what happens when college-people read college-
. people. '
' Judging by the ﬁction, which is, as usual,
the most conspicuous feature of the issue, one
‘might say that the enlightened minds on the cam-
pus are at least taking a serious
view of things, even bordering on
"the depressive.
». Annamae Pavlosky’ s lead-piece,
“With Perspective,” builds a
t a needling ﬁrst scene with the
meticulousness of a spider spin-
ning a web—only then to trail out
on a thin thread which leaves the L
weighty reader behind, unable to ~ 
follow, and unable — when the DA!-GLISH _
spider comes back to believe that he’s stuck in
the same web. He goes too far in too short a time,
one feels. _ . .
Miss Pavlosky’s character is a sob-muffin with
whom intimacy after one page or two becomes
embarrassing. Her bitter-sweet style, in empha-
sizing the morbidly unpleasant, has certain. at-
tractions—but in this example is short on disci-
pline and weak on character.
’ Fiction, to stand on its own two feet (and
‘ Miss Pavlosky’s does not), must discover some-
thing new and yet evident, wrapped in the be- _
lievable garment of fresh experience. Without
this verisimilitude of proven experience and
originality, ﬁction is a needless ‘repetition of
itself. » s
Rudolph Ricci’s “Orlando” suffers from the
same lack of discipline, i.e., balance between the

Orlando is a sort of Colin Wilson type “out-
sider” Whose war experiences have robbed him of
his creativity, and who lives among trivialities,
described with much vivd imagery. He no longer
has the strength to live out his ideal, and in fact
regards it very dubiously. In the face of modern
commercial vulgarity — a cheap science-ﬁction
movie starring a girl he once loved——the art of
Orlando collapses. He wanders down the-street,
thinking forlornly of a picture he is going to
paint, when suddenly a recollection of the movie
comes back to him, and the small bit that remains
from his i-deal disintegrates.

It is pitiful, but one is not moved because
one wonders why Orlando fell in love with vul-
garity in the ﬁrst place.

Ron Caplan’s “The Dream Had "Begun Again”
is the strongest piece of ﬁction in the issue. The
grotesque here reaches a high point, ina moon-
lit mystery of motivation where a dualistic sit-
uation seems to divide into two realities, both
achieving themselves in the present, and where
characters become indistinct, between moonlight
and shadow.

An old .man’s misery and phantasy are bun-
dled together with a skill that promises, but with
a certain psychological inaccuracy, perhaps due
to the caprices of a mind considerably younger
than that of the old man. Intriguing, one might
say, or nerve-racking!

Turning to non-ﬁction, Jim Marino contri-
butes an interpretive essay on. literary criticism
which points out one major absurdity of mod-
e-rn “creative” criticism. Marino suggests a re-
turn to the more conservative and reasonable

V attitudes of the neo-classicists. His essay has

the rare merit of being rigorously organized and
exciting! ' » ‘

to persuade as to explain to the laymen and exhort
his own cadres to a purer conception of their
idealogy.

The weak point in the essay is the author's de-
crial of the “lack of veneration extant.” If that is
the heart of the problem in institutionalizing con-
servatism as the author wishes, it seems more
logical to assume that “veneration” will -be re-
generated in the yet-to-come, and not by general-.
izations from the past.

Poetry, for some reason, seems to be the
most vigorous form of, college literature. Why
college students ‘make better poets than novel-
ists is not much of a mystery; poetry is more
suited to their level of ‘experince. This issue
of Ideas and Figures, in fact, wages an impres-
sive campaign to that effect.

Ann Richardson in “African Woman” and

R. Morgan Morrison in “Poem,” without mutilat-
ing the poetic line, produce delightful fresh effects
with concrete imagery and a simplicity of the
verb. Miss Richardson’s poem is especially un-
pretentious and .convincing. She writes with a
glamorous feminine touch which makes her par-
ticulars seem larger than life. Her African_wom-
an is essentially the universal woman. Morrison’s
“Poem,” a sort of illustration of Nietzche’s mys-
tical doctrine of Eternal Recurrence, leads us

along a symbol-laden road which concludes this
very heavy and serious magazine with an Oriental- -

like uplift of spirit.

The other poems, which approach the universal
more brashly, lose out in comparison, but one nev-
er doubts that they-are poetry.

The art work and photographs——all good
but none striking, except a haloed face by Irene
Fertik which is both—appear in small uninte-
grated morsels throughout the issue. Why not
illustrate?

The issue rides the precarious path between
caverns ‘of the nevrosed consciousness and the
high plains of reason, not a perfect synthesis by
any means. But after all the reader has some in-
teresting choices.

FLEA6U2E T0 655 A TEST WITH SOMANY

 Goldwater Extreme?
  c Nearly Everyone ls

By ALEX D’IPPOLITO

One of the favorite charges hurled at Barry Goldwater
 this campaign is that he and all around him are extrem-
7 ~ ists.” Not only is Goldwater an extremist, so the sayings

 go, but his staff members are extremist, so the sayings
extremists, his wife is an extremist, his dog IS an extrem-
ist, -ad. nauseum. “ _

Moderation is the virtue and although the _middle of
the road” appears on no map, it is the superhighway of
politics. The more violently one opposes Goldwater the more
moderate he is. _ .

But when one tries to discover_what people mean when
they use the terms moderation, middle of the road, _main-
stream-, and extremism, he ﬁnds some confusion arising.

-OF COURSE an extremist is one who tries to achieve
his goals through radical actions. But we run into some
‘trouble ‘here because Dr. Martin Luther King .in his famous
“Letter from Birmingham City J all after subduing his
initial resentment to charges that his actions were of an
extreme vairiety said, “As I continued to think about the
matter I gradually gained a bit of satisfaction from being
considered an extremist.” Dr. King continued his explana-
tion by asking, “Was not Jesus an extremist in love?

.. So this conception of extremism is no good. After all,
_- Dr. King opposes Goldwater. .
Well, how about extremism i_n thoughts? Certainly
 Senator Goldwater’s recent suggestion of giving control of
" tactical nuclear weapons to NATO is an extreme suggestion.
But then again it was not extremism when Senator Hum-
 phrey in the early ﬁfties and again in his 1960; Senate cam-
.: .paign advocated giving the U.N. control of United States
nuclear ‘ power. ’

NOR CAN IT be considered extremism when Hubert’s
Americans for Democratic Action favors “general and com-
 plete disarmament (except for United Nations armed force)

' and unilateral United States initiatives to that end”; not
a frantic cry was heard when Senator Joe Clark proposed
. _ a plank to the 1964 Democratic platform saying the same

thing.
" Since we can tell an extremist by the type of bedfello-ws
, he attracts, surely there must be some similarity between
Goldwater and a Bircher because of the latter’s avid sup-
port of the former. But, even though American Communist
‘ leader Gus Hall and the boys, on direct orders from Mos-
! cow, are hitting the campaign trail for President Johnson
‘ A this year we cannot (and rightly so) call him a Communist.
And after all, to be fair about the matter we can’t call
’Humphrey an ADA disarmer, Johnson a Communist, or
. Goldwater a Bircher simply because these groups share or
" at least appear to share some of the views of these men.
Remember it was the right-wing Senator Joseph McCarthy
who used the “guilt by association technique.” To do the
same would be associating with McCarthy.

That’s why it’s important to interpret events correctly
—-the way the Washington Post does. But it is still just a
little confusing why the Post called Goldwater’s sugges-
tion to strike at the supply lines in North Vietnam “brink-_
manship” (with all the evil connotations of the word) and
J ohnson’s decision to attack North Vietnamese bases in
the Gulf of Tonkin and Kennedy’s Cuban blockade “states-
manship.”

Since it is extremely difficult to deﬁne extremism in
' such a way that we can all comfortably abhor extremists
we are “left” with only one alternative——and that is to
ask not whether one is or is not a extremist or even whether.
1 extremism is or is not bad but rather ask as one writer so
_succ_intly did, “What extremism is your extremism?”

 

 

 Oakland Votes Will Protest

Renewal Plan of Chancellor

By AL JANEZIC . '

When the people of lower Oakland
go to the polls this November, they will
vote against Chancellor Litchﬁeld. They
have read about the backlash and the
frontlash and have come up with one of
their own: It’s called the Litchfield Lash,
and it i'sn’t funny.

For several years
the Oakland resi-
dents have been un-
easy and afraid;
afraid of losing
their houses to the
University’ of Pitts-
burgh under the
guise of the City
Redevelopment Au-
thority. The people
are convinced that

JANEZIC , the authority, form-
er mayor David L. Lawrence and the
Chancellor are in cahoots to grab their
houses and their land.

Furthermore, they claim that Lawr-
ence has a ﬁnancial interest in the shen-
anigans and being a close friend of
President Johnson could get some sort of
approval to manipulate the land area
as he pleased.

NO ONE HAS spelled out any par-
ticulars. But if Johnson is reelected, the
reasoning goes, the headache ball will
swing. If he is defeated, they realize the
result may only work like an aspirin: It
provides temporary relief but no assur-
ance the ache won’t return.

 

Bickering began last fall when the
city took positive steps to begin tearing
down the houses in an area bounded by

Bates and South Bouquet Streets, Forbes
and McKee Avenues. At that time, men
snooped through houses, appraising every-
thing from the dog house to wall-to-
wall rugs. Residents countered with
neighborhood meetings, petitions and
lawyers. Nothing happened.

Afterwards, Oaklanders sat tight,
waiting for a notice to move. No one
fixed a leaking rainspout, replaced a
worn shingle or painted the front porch.
It . wasn’t worth the money. Soon they
thought, the demolition crews would be-
gin.

SINCE THEN, no one’s house has
been torn down and rumors have been

i rampant. Everyone is speculating "mo-

tives for the delay. One woman just last
week was considering plunging ahead
with new wall-to-wall carpeting. She
was stopped by her neighbor. “Don’t,”.
she advised. “Wait until after the elec-
tion.”

So now everyone is waiting again.
But in the meantime they are thinking.
These people see‘ Chancellor Litchﬁeld
as a monarch with an insatiable appetite
for power and land; as a ruler who came
to reign in Oakland ten years ago and
who brought trouble by buying, tearing,
building and pushing. They fear their

Open Door

Editor, The Pitt News:
Re the letter which Mr. Jay

Goldstein authored in the Wednes- ’

day, Sept. 23, issue of The Pitt
News.

I believe Mr. Goldstein is try-
ing to make a point in his letter,
but he stops short .of reaching
any worthwhile one, ‘except that
sarcasm can be written by any-
one. Mr. Goldstein makes several
statements which do not strike
me as being representative of the
truth.

First, I am sure that the “self-
appointed arbiters of sexual mor-
ality,” as he calls the rules makers
of the graduate dorm, have not
set out to insult grad students by
curtailing women visitation. Most
certainly they are not trying to
dictate or impose their own mor-
ality rules on grad students such
as Mr. Goldstein. It is merely the
responsibility of these “arbiters”
to prevent any of these “isolated
instances of pregancy” from oc-
curing on the campus of the Uni-
versity.

It is also my belief that the
revenue of the surrounding mo-
tels has not increased appreciab-
ly due to the “open door policy.”
Anything that is going to happen
between girl and boy can happen
in a car, inthe park, or in any
one of .a hundred cheaper places
than the neighborhood motel. It
is simply that what students do
off campus is of little concern to
University officials; what we do
on campus is of GREAT concern
to them. '

What has happened, however, is ’

 

   
  

decisions at times, just as we
will do. Perhaus, though, the poli-
cy on_ women visitation in the
graduate dorm is a correct one; I
think so. I salute the “open door.”
And may we maintain our rec-
ord of not one “isolated instance
of pregnancy” in the dorms.

Residents
Ask Change

Editor, The Pitt News:

It seems to us that if the al-
leged resolution concerning all-
University programs sponsored
by the houses is true, that we
have made a mistake. We do not
wish to remain in an atmosphere
which prohibits us from helping
our house host University stu-
dents at properly organized func-
tions.

As any fool can plainly see (?),
the Men's Dorm Council is a good
organization. But is too large to
plan every social event for all of
the residents of the Towers. It is
our belief that there should be a
devision of power in the Towers.
Each house should have a certain
amount of autonomy in planning
social events.

In this manner there would be
a broader scope of ideas used in
organizing University functions.
With more men participating in
these events, the end result
should be a dormitory which
really. stimulates its occupants.
~ University administrators make

Thus, in a university that is
growing rapidly both physically
and intellectually, it seems strange
that a large number of students
should be stiﬂed for the mere
sake of expediency in communi-
cation. .

Portland Papers
Call Oregon Lucky

PORTLAND, Ore. — Newspapers here made it abun-
dantly clear that Oregon was a lucky team in their 22-13
win over the Panthers Saturday night. One paper said,
“Oregon parlayed a rabbit’s foot, a four-leaf clover and some
timely aerial shots” to beat Pitt Saturday night.

_ k . The papers were not being bitter,

1 they were stating what happened.

V . The Panthers dominated Oregon in

 every phase of the game except sco-r-

" ing legal touchdowns.

The Panthers racked up 22 ﬁrst
" downs to 12 for Oregon and had a

 

230 for the Ducks.
But it is scoring that counts in
 football and that is what the Pan-
thers lack. The cohesion of the 1963
unit is missing this year. The present

303 SMIZIK team moves the ball just as well as

- as last year’s squad but can’t seem to get the ball across the

goal often enough.
Inexperience is part of the reason, but one observer,

' who has followed Pitt closely over the past two seasons

feels the team is lacking the meaness of last year’s squad.
He said the ability of players like Jeff Ware, Al Grigaliunas
and Rick Leeson may be equaled on this year’s team, but
not their meaness.
_ The team now has two relatively easy opponents com
ing up in William & Mary and West Virginia. Against these
teams they should pick up their ﬁrst and second wins, gain
needed experience, and hopefully get meaner and tougher.
Inexperience was especially evident Saturday night at
defensive safety where oe Pohl started the game. Although
the Panthers Were playing against one of the top long pass
threats in the country in Bob Berry, coach John Michelosen
said he started Pohl “to give him some experience.” Pohl got

. some experience sitting on the bench after Oregon’s Corky

Sullivan got behind him for a long pass reception in the sec-
ond period.

His successor, "senior Fran Novak, fell victim to the
same play later in the period and he was replaced by Fred
Mazurek.

One position that does appear to be shaping up is tackle.
Although bothregulars, Ron Linaburg and Jim Jones were
hurt and barely played Saturday, the tackles accredited
themselves well. ,

The biggest surprise was senior Dennis Bernick. A dis-
appointment for the past two seasons, Bernick was ‘the only
lineman. who earned Michelosen’s praise after the game.
Jones will be hard pressed to win back his starting job once
his bad ankle heals.

. Tom Raymond, an infrequent performer last year, also
did a good job as one of the replacements for Linaburg.
. The improvements at tackles will have to matched at
end and in the defensive backﬁeld. The Panthers are basical-

' ill’ a good team. Any team with a player the quality of Ma-

zurek has got to be good. What is standing in their way is
that slight difference which separates average teams from
good teams—extra effort.

Harriers Win
Triangular
At Kent State

The cross-country team won its
second meet of the season Satur-
day at Kent State, defeating both
Kent State and Ohio Uuniversity
in the triangular meet, 31-35-'64.
Kent State placed last.

“The boys ran real well,” coach
Jim Banner explained after the
meet. “I was very statisﬁed with
them.”

The harriers’ performance
was an improvement over last
year, when in a similar trian-
gular meet, Panther runners
placed second with 54 points.

Penn State’s cross-country team
travels here one week from Sat-
urday for the Panther’s next
meet. “That’s going to be a rough
one,” Banner said. “Penn State
usually has a strong team.” Last
year, the Lions topped the Pan-
thers, 19-41.

Fortune Abandons
Team in Setback

By BOB SNHZIK
PORTLAND, Ore. — John Michelosen played football
the way Chancellor Litchﬁeld likes it here Saturday night

and came out a loser, 22-13, to Oregon.

Michelosen should have known a gambler needs two attributes
to be a success—skill and luck. The skill was there in abundant
quantities in the persons of Fred Mazurek, Barry McKnight, Dennis
Bernick and Marty Schottenheimer. But Michelosen and the Panthers
had no luck as the events of the game so aptly proved.

Michelosen’s big gamble came with ﬁve minutes left to play
after the Panthers had just scored to make it a 14-13 game. The Pan-
thers went for two points instead of one and on .a fake kick attempt
the ball went to Mazurek. But the tough Pitt line, which had made
a shambles out of Oregon in the second half, for once did not hold
and Mazurek was spilled on the ﬁve-yard line.

The way things were going is the Panthers had kicked, the ball
probably would have hit the upright.

The Panthers crossed the goal line twice without getting .any
points. .

The ﬁrst time came early in the third quarter after they marched
57 yards to the Oregon two, while trailing, 14-7. Dale Stewart plunged
over the goal from that point for an apparent score. But the referee
said Stewart lost possession of the ball before crossing the goal line.

After the g.ame Michelosen said, “Stewart and several other of
my players said the fumble wasn’t made until after Dale crossed the
goal line. They said that Stewart didn’t fumble until he hit the ground.

But Harry Cartales, the Oregon player who recovered the fum-
ble, said, “Stewart wasn’t over the goal when he fumbled. He was
on about the one-yard line.’’

A moment of greater frustration hit the Panthers minutes after
they missed the two-point conversion try. They held Oregon for
downs after the kickoff, but Stewart fumbled again on the Panthers
ﬁrst play. It was actually a blessing, though.

Oregon’s vaunted quarterback Bob Berry threw a screen pass
on ﬁrst down which was picked off by Eric Crabtree, who ran 80-
yards for another apparent touchdown.

But back on the line of scrimmage an official detected Panther
end Mitch Zalnasky offsides and the play went over. Oregon soon
moved in for its ﬁnal and decisive touchdown.

Zalnasky said he didn’t know what he had done wrong, but that
he didn’t charge before the snap of the ball.

With the exception of two ﬁrst half plays the Panthers actually
did a good job of stopping the touted Oregon passing attack, which is
led by all-America candidate Berry. -

on one Berry hit end Corky Sullivan with a 56-yard pas set-
ting up the ﬁrst Oregon score. On another second unit quarterback
Mike Brundage, running from a halfback spot, threw a 41-yard pass
to Ray Palm, the second Oregon score.

The Panther defense was superb in the second half led by Bernick
and Schottenheimer. Michelosen cited Bernick, a second unit tackle
playing in place of injured Jim Jones, as “the lineman who impressed
me the most.” ’

Schottenheirner, who had made more tackles in two games than
most players make in a season, seemed to always be just where the
Panthers needed him.

But what the Panthers needed most——luck—strictly belonged to
Oregon.

Booters Buckle Under Pressure

By BILL CABIN

Cal Bonawitz Hds  ester Win, 3-2

  
 

_ Fullback Cal Bonawitz blocked a shot on goal with
his hand Saturday, giving West Chester the free shot that
won the soccer game, 3-2. The play came with ﬁve min-
utes left, and stunned both teams.

“Cal saw that his man had him beaten, and rather
than take a chance of him scoring, he intentionally block-
ed,” said coach Leo Bemis. Mel Lorback, West Chester
coach and chairman of the district NCAA soccer com-
mittee, said, “The only reason I could give is that he
did it as a defensive tactic.” ‘

The play was ironic because the only man between
Bonawitz .and the goal was goalie Ken Lang.

The only plausible explanation Bemis could offer
was Bona.witz’s unawareness of the circumstances.
“Lack of communication hindered our team all day,”
said Bemis. “When you play soccer everyone has to
act as a. quarterback and warn the player with the

, ball if an opponent is around or if there's a man in
the open.

“We got bogged down and as a result of insufficient
talking we had some stupid play,” Bemis said. “We broke
up several of our own plays by bumping into one another
and not calling for balls.” Frosh coach Bob McNulty

HALFBACK GEORGE SOMMER and fullback Andy Mc-
Graw (hidden by hands) help goalie Ken Lang block
West Chester shot. Fullback Jim Cuddy approaches play
in the background. West ‘Chester ‘won, 3-2.

   

 

~ * Besides lack of communication, the booters were un-
 _v able to keep up with the fast pace of the experienced
”' ‘ Rams. “Our strategy is always to keep a fast pace and

hope that the opponent will be pressured into a mistake,”
said Lorback.

Bemis said, “Our inexperience showed under the
pressure. Our inside men and halfbacks couldn’t quite
match their veteran players.” Lorback agreed with Bemis
saying, “The decisive factor in the game was our ability
to control mid-ﬁeld.”

“They clogged up the center with Blum and forced
us to the outside constantly. Our strategy then was to
play on the wings, but we didn’t do enough of it,” said
Bemis. Schwartz agreed, “If we had played the wings
a little more effectively, we'd have won.”

Both goals were scored by working the ball down
between Shimpino the center-forward, and right wing
Aldo Zortea. “Our problem. wasn’t getting through
their defense so much as it was scoring once we had
the position,” said Bemis. ‘

Despite the, loss, Lorback was impressed by the boot-
ers. “We have never had an easy game against Pitt, and
this one was hard fought. They’ve got a stronger club
thanzlast year and I expect that they'll progress steadily

‘ as the year goes '7on,”_he said.

Public Health Wins, 9-4

By GEORGE LIES

Our Gang fell to the power of Public Health, 9-4, in the
second Week of intramural softball play at Schenley Oval.
Led by Duke Martin’s four hits, including two doubles, Pub-
lic Health won its second game in a row. Skip Coleman lim-
ited Our Gang to just nine hits while raising his record to

2-0 in one of the best games of

‘the season thus far.

Other Independent League con-

‘ tests found the Tower Grads elim-

inating the Dorm Counselors, 5-3.
This evened their record at one
win and one loss. Faigi was the
winning pitcher, handing Al Moye
his second loss.

 In an electrifying‘ ball game,

Lasers squeezed past Dent
Beavers by a. score of 11-10.
Palapino and Pavuk hit home
runs in a losing cause. Monaco
helped pitcher M-ahalic win his
ﬁrst game of the season by hit-
ting two home runs.
Bob Knight gave up only eight
hits to Sigma Chi in earning a

SW9-3 victory for Delta Tau Delta.
7 Delta Tau banged out 20 hits

against losing pitcher W. Pekim-
mer.
Ray Goeke and Skip Kebel each

hit two home runs while leading
Tower B (17, 18, 19) in a trounc-

,, ing of Roundhouse, 17-8. Ralph

eliminating the ’House.

Hawthorne and Tower B (14,
