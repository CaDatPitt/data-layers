Teach-In On Draft Registration ReminiscentOf

By SETH LUBOVE
Pitt News Staff Writer

A draft teach—in, similar in style
to those originated.at Pitt during
the Vietnam protest era,'was held
yesterday afternoon in the Student
Union. The teach-in was sponsored
by the Pitt Ad Hoc Committee
Against the Draft. '

The speakers discussed a wide
range of topics concerning opposi-
tion.to the draft, including women
and the draft, Soviet foreign policy,
the nuclear arms race, and lessons
learned from draft protests during
the Vietnamera. .

David Goldberg, who spent nine-

teen months in federal prison as a"
draft resister, had advocated not
cooperating with the Selective "Ser-

vice during the Vietnam era, with

the initial hope that there would be
mass resistance.

Despite the severe consequences
of Goldberg’s protest, he had
hoped it would have been ”a cut-
ting edge in terms‘of stopping the
war.”

Goldberg saw the roots of the
student protests as an “awareness
that the working class and blacks
were the ones being drafted.” Even
though they were receiving
deferments, the students‘ began to

consider ways of stopping the war,
so that no one might be drafted.
Dr. Robert G. Colodny, pro-
fessor of history at Pitt spoke of the
“lessons of Vietnam,” referring to
the veterans of that conflict as
”that vast‘ multitude who have

melted into the shadows of society,"

having passed through the rice pad-
dies of Vietnam. .
Colodny blamed Vietnam for

‘ “the Watergates of the seventies,”

describing the United States as “a

University Prepares For Evaluation

By PATTI LANGFORD

Pitt News Staff Writer

In preparation for the 1986 Mid-

dle States [accreditation] Evalua-
tion, Pitt will place emphasis’ on
the
undergraduate sector of the Univer-
sity, according to Dr. Robert
Nossen, Associate Provost.
Although —the evaluation usually
covers the entire University, Nossen
stated that Pitt authorities have
decided to concentrate on
undergraduate planning because of
the undergraduate majority and a
belief that any improvements in the
undergraduate program should,

idealistically, contribute to the,

graduate program.

The Middle States Evaluation,
conducted by an outside team of
observers appointed by the Com-

”!?mission on Higher Education, is
part of a decennial regional ac-'

creditation process by the Middle

' States Association of Colleges and
1 Schools. The Association»is a non-
; ~7p_rofi.t’,_ i independent __rnember_ship~

  

 

organization. There are five similar
regional organizations in the United
States.

Also, part of ‘the accreditation
process is a self-study to be done by
the institution.

Pitt’s self-study is set up in the
form of a steering committee com-
prised of persons from each school
[CAS, CGS, FAS, etc.]. Each
school, in turn, does it’s own self-
study, the results of which will be
turned into Nossen, who will sum-
marize and present them to the
Middle States Evaluation team,

"next November. ’

In an address to the chancellor’s
meeting ‘with the university deans,
academic directors and department
Chairpersons on January 16, Nossen
outlined some of the basic issues to

— be looked at in undergraduate plan-

ning. He expressed concern for the
increasing. trend of high school
graduates seeking vocational rather

than a vlibehrfal arts eduacation, as ;

stitution over another. Also ad-
dressed were questions pertaining to
minority enrollment and adult
education. 3

According to a 1979 information
bulletin prepared by the Middle
States Association, “accreditation
is an expression of confidence in an
institution’s purposes, performance
and resources.” ' i

“Failure to be accredited can

‘have a serious affect on a school, in

areas such as tranfers or allocations
of grants and loans,” said Nossen.

‘ Though Pitt is in no danger of

. losing its accredition Dr. J ._ Steele

Gow, dean of the College of
General Studies [CGS], views the
self-study program, ;“_‘... as an op-
portunity, every ten years, to step
back and look at what we’re
doing.” . '

Socialist Group Holds
Anti -Draft Program

By SETH LUBOVE
Pitt News Staff Writer

Anti-draft activities continued
Tuesday night,-when the Young
Socialist Alliance sponsored a
forum titled “Women, The Draft,

, and the ERA” in David Lawrence
Hall with featured speaker Mary
>rZins. C

 .‘. *1 

Zins, womens’ rights activist and
member of the United Mineworkers
of America, concentrated on the
role of women in the proposed draft
registration, ‘emphasizing that it is
in women’s interest to fight against
registration and the draft.

“Part of the reason that Carter is
talking about drafting women is to
confuse the whole issue,” Zins said.

“He’d like for people to assume
there’s going to be a draft no matter
what, so he clouds the issue by rais-

’ ing the question of whether or not

women should be included when
the real discussion" should be
whether or not there should be a
draft at all,” she added. ‘ ‘ ,
' Zins also criticized Carter for his
“sudden support of women’s
equality.”

“All of a sudden, Jimmy Carter

1 is a staunch supporter of women’s

rights,_when he’s done nothing to
get ERA passed, nothing to insure

that women have access to abor-

tions, nothing to help unemployed
women get jobs....but he wants to
make sure that women have equal
rights by getting them drafted,”
Zins said. A

Zins discussed the logic of
the National Organization of
Women’s recent statement com-

mending “Carter’s action of‘equity_

to include both men and women in

‘ 'women’s rights groups, specifically‘  

the proposed registration,” and she A

questioned whether or not the in-
clusion of women in "the draft
should be considered a step towards
equality.

“It would hardly be in women’s .

rights’-interest. The draft is actually
taking away someone’s rights,” she
added. _
V “It tells you you’re going to war
to kill someone just like yourself,”
Zins added. if
Attacking Carter’s definition of
equal rights, Zins said, “When
Carter talks about equal rights for
women, he’s talking about equal
rights to die.”

Pitt News Staff Writer

The University Honors Convoca-
tion was held on Wednesday to
acknowledge university students
and faculty who have excelled in
academic and leadership areas.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar said

, that the aim of the ceremony was to

“recognize that the central purpose
of the university was the pursuit of
excellence in scholarship.”
Posvar added that the recogni-
tion of these scholars and leaders by

- the university and organizations na-

tion and worldwide was proof of
our commitment to these ideas.

Awards included the recognition
of university scholars [those who
are in the top 2 per cent of their
class], special academic awards and
awards to student leaders.

“Our 193-year history is built on
excellence and we as a university do
what we do better than any other in-

Self-Designed Advisor Position To

By TERESA soKoL
Pitt News Staff Writer
Plans to eliminate the position of

advisor to "self-designed majors may ’

have undesirable consequences for

, the program, according to Susanna

Downie, currently part-time_advisor
to students who design their own
course of study. Downie was

’ recently informed by CAS Dean Ir-

win Schulman that the position
would -be eliminated June 1.
Efforts by the CAS Council to
tighten the self-designed major pro-
gram may cause the program to be
placed in a ‘‘low priority,” Downie
added.‘ ,
Downie is responsible for

tion, and our job as the repository
of faith and hope for the future we
help shape,” Posvar said.

Dr. Conney Kimbo, Vice
Chancellor for student affairs said,
“Students must actively assume
leadership roles. Your challenge is
to make the most ‘of your abilities.”

In presenting the faculty awards
Dr. Jerome L_. Rosenberg, vice pro-
vost and clean of the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences ‘said, “the thing that
distinguishes one university from
another is its faculty. The faculty
here has been recognized by the
university, professional organiza-
tions, national organizations and
groups around'the world.’ ’

In response, Dr. Monto Ho, of
Pitt’s Medical School said, “We
wish to thank the university for
- granting us the right and freedom to
extend ourselves, and first and
foremost we dedicate ourselves to
learning.”

‘sufficient rigor and depth to be con-
sidered a major. .
These responsibilities will be ab-

sorbed into the office of Assistant

Dean Reed Reading, according to
Schulman. '

"Under the current council pro-
posals, students wishing to design a
major would have to consult with a
three-member faculty panel with
‘one faculty advisor, who the stit-
dent would be responsible for ob-
taining, and two supplementary ad-
visors appointed through the dean's
office.‘ Currently, one faculty
member and Downie direct a stir-
dent’s course of study. ‘

Working out a course of study
with three advisors may discourage
rather than encourage student in-

/

in the ORL or RSAT office .

Also announced at the Convoca-
tion was the Omicron Delta Kappa
Senior of the Year Award. This
year’s winner was Joseph C. Heim,
whose name will be engraved ‘on the
Omicron walk at the Cathedral of
Learning.

This year’s guest speaker was Dr.
Karl W. Deutsch, Stanfield pro-
fessor of International Peace at
Harvard. Dr. Deutsch was
presented with an honorary doc-
torate in humane letters.

Deutsch spoke of the coming age
of high information, when most of
mankind will be involved‘ in some
aspect of information services.

“We are becoming more and
more sophisticated in our uses of in-

formation,” said Deutsch. “Radio.

Criticisms levelled by the council
in recent meetings have also given
Downie cause for ' concern.

Both Schulman and ‘ Downie
acknowledge that they have had dif-
ferences of opinion about the major
goals of the self-designed course of
study. Schulman had phrased this
discrepancy of mission as the “ten-
sion between utility and
knowledge” at a March 10 meeting
of the council. V _

Many students designing a major
emphasize the vocational aspects of
their "study in an attempt to be
marketable when the time comes to
find a job, according to Downie‘. .

Because of this clash of belief,

. Zbigniew Brzezinski,

-,5.’ By SETH LUBOVE
 Pitt News Staff Writer

In another anti-draft forum high-
lighting women and the draft, the
Steel City National Organization
for Women, formally Campus
NOW, met in David Lawrence Hall
on Wednesday night to discuss
NOWs position on female equality
in the draft.

Linda Norquist, a steelworker
and union activist, along with Tom
Onieal, head of the Pittsburgh
chapter of the Committee Against
Registration and the Draft
(r.g3ARD), were the featured
speakers, presenting their opposi-
tion to the proposed registration for
the draft.

“The anti-draft movement is a
legitimate expression of the mass
opposition to Washington’s war
aims,” Norquist said. “NOW
should be doing everything possible
to fight against the draft.”

But Norquist disagrees
NOWS
President Carter’s action of equity
to include both men and women in

with

statement commending .

the proposed registration, accusing
NOW of “attempting to walk down
both sides of the street” and on
“resting their entire argument on
that if women don’t go into the
military, then we’ll never win
equality.”

In a statement printed in the
Pennsylvania NOW Times
Magazine‘ and elaborated in a
25-page position paper of the Na-
tional Organization for Women,
NOW states: “NOW is against
registration because it will, in fact,
stimulate war.”

But then, further on in the state-

ment the following four points are.

stated: A
—“But until the ERA is ratified,

women will have the responsibilities _
_ for national defense without the

equal protection of law."
—“Women match or exceed men

in qualifications, performance, (in-

cluding combat effectiveness) and
retention rates.”

_—“The cost of sex discrimina-
tion in the military today is wasted
potential,” and

0 I

—“The debate in Congress
should not be the registration of
women. Rather, it should be how
quickly we can safely eliminate the
barriers to women’s full participa-
tion in the military.”

Norquist attacked the statement
in the NOW Times Magazine as

' “reading like it was sent out by the

Pentagon” and she interpreted
NOW’s position to be “couched on
the most defeatist terms.

“Equality in a military that is
used to plunder the world is not
what women are fighting for,”
Norquist said. “A co-ed Army
would be forced to commit the
same crimes and support dictators
like the Shah of Iran or Samoza.

“The crux of the matter is:
‘whose. war is this?’_ ” she said. The
general recognition is that we’re not
under attack...it’s not our war, it’s

«a war for the rich oil companies.

“We don’t have to send our
women off to fight a war for the

rich,” Norquist said. “But give us v

something to fight for and wewill
ﬁght.”

 

Norquist accused the United
States’ government of “propping
up the rnost vicious dictators” and
that “these dictators defended
United States’ business interests,
and that’s why the United States’
government sends troops to defend
these dictators.”

Norquist also said that sections
of the third world are becoming
more assertive and are taking away
United States’ business interests,
and that the third world countries
that have lived under dictators

“take inspiration from the revolu- '

tions. ’ ’

“The third world is gaining in-
creased confidence, so American
business is getting scared,” she
said. '

“The way Carter presents the
issue, he seems to be saying ‘you

want equality . . . . ..go to war!’ We
want men to be equal with
women . . . . ..everyone- should be

out of the military,” she said.
Tom Onieal of.-CARD said Presi-

“The reason Carter called for,

message to the American conserva-
tives that he’s a tough leader, but at
the expense of coming genera-

Onieal ‘said the conservatives
have been pressuring Congress to

,“get rid of the all-volunteer Army”

because of “laxing military
discipline” and “a decline in the
quality of candidates.”

“The all-volunteer Army has

been performing as well as a draft-
time Army—they’re getting better
quality as evidenced by improved
test scores and more high school
graduates who are applying,”
Onieal said. , .

Soviet Foreign Po|icy,Arms Race Discussed At Drdft Teach-In

(Continued from Page I)

“It is important‘ to keep in mind
that this is not an act committed in
isolation. You have to look at the
world climate,” said Dr. "William
Chase, ' assistant professor of
history at the University of Pitt-
sburgh. R

President Carter appointed
national
security advisor, “who has built a
career on saying that Russia is the

most henious nation in the world,” _

said Chase, who sees Brzezinski as
having a major inﬂuence on
Carter’s increased military spen-
ding.

Chase also discussed the Carter
Doctrine in the Persian Gulf as “ex—
ploiting many deep-seated fears
that right-wing factions have been
pressuring on us for years.”

Molly Rush, representing the
Mobilization for Survival group,
targeted her remarks at the nuclear
arms race.

“We’re talking about a real
possibility of nuclear war,” she
said, referring to a possible super-
power confrontation. V

But her main fear stems from the
nuclear buildup between the United
States and tRussia, and the
economic effects of placing too

much money into nuclear arms.
“Essentially, civilization would

bepretty much wiped out,” she

said. i -
“I’m very frightened about the

Rev. Elizabeth Scott from the
University and City Ministries,
recently returned from a trip to
Iran, said she believes the U.S.
government couldn’t care less about
the hostages in Tehran, but “they
want to exploit sentiment to go to
war so we can defend U.S. interests.
“It’s much easier" to steal in-

terests than it is to develop them in

your own country,” Scott said.
But the m ain purpose of the

teach-in remained as a protest to
President Carter’s call for registra-

'tion, providing information and

serving as an educational forum for

students worried about registration. «

“We need to show, onceagain,
that Pittsburgh will be a,force in

stopping the draft,” said Tom

Onieal, head of the Pittsburgh
chapter of the Committee Against
Registration and the Draft.

“There are indications that the

said. ‘

College students can make their
small living spaces more attractive
and functional without spending a
fortune, according to Dave Farrar,
national home furnishings coor-
dinator for Montgomery Ward and
Company.

Farrar said in a recent interview,
that students in college residence
halls should consider spending a

-reasonable sum of money making

their living quarters reflect their
tastes and personalities.

“Even though you know that
your life at Pitt, or any university, is
a temporary one,” said Farrar,
“you should do the best you can
with the space you have. You

  I _g.':      o ‘t  _ ,   
‘ge7"4-—‘-F_riday,‘March 14, 1980' - ' '

should ask yourself, ‘What can I do
to the space to make it usable, and
at the same time interesting? I
don’t have a. lot of money, but I

want the maximum return out of ‘

this space.’ Your next question
should be, ‘what achieves this end’

“Think in terms of color,” said
Farrar. “You should think. of what
will best represent how you feel. If
you are vivacious or a cheerful sort,
then you should pick a color that
shows that. Choose a paint, a high
quality, semi- or high-gloss paint
that will suit your needs. A gallon
of paint should cover the room; ex-
pect to pay $10 to $12 for a long
lasting paint that will perk up your

room, that will reflect you as an in- .

dividual. ’ ’

, Can Reflect One's Personality

Farrar said that living space, to
be interesting, should show stu-
dent’s concept of stage appearance.

“By using one color scheme.

throughout the room, in different
values and intensities, a student can
create a stage setting,” Farrar said.
“With a semi-gloss paint, you
might ask yourself the question,
‘Am I goingto tire of this?’ but the
answer is often, ‘no,’ because semi-
gloss paint will reflect light well,
and give you great shadow effects.”
The walls should uniformly be
the same color, according to Farrar.
He added that objects in the room
can enhance the overall appearance
if they contrast with the wall color.

“It’s an inexpensive way to get an _

expensive look,” said Farrar.

I   Opposing

 » Registration

The Student Government Board’s resolution sup- '
_ porting President Carter’s call for reinstatement of

draft registration is a shocking occurrence.

It is shocking not because the board wrote the
resolution, but rather because it is based on a survey
of students, fifty percent of whom support Carter’s
move. I ' '

While polling approximately 700 students may not

be fully indicative of total student opinion at Pitt,'thel

fact remains that there is fairly strong support for
mandatory draft registration, if surveys -of this
nature properly represent a cross section of the stu-
dent body at Pitt.‘ '

/.

In an editorial in January, The Pitt News expressed
opposition to mandatory’ registration. We remain
steadfast in this opinion. The reasons for the opposi-
tion also remain the same.

The United States sovereignty is not at stake; there
are no enemy ships off our shores or troopsiwaiting
to invade our borders, Instead, reinstatement of
registration is a political move to warn the Soviet
Union to behave itself.

Also, rather than attempting to bolster the all-

‘ volunteer force, the president has chosen to place the

future of draft-age individuals in jeopardy. As we
said in the January editorial, draft registration is one
step closer to conscription. ’

Students and other draft-age individuals should see
the proposed mandatory registration for whatitiis. It

is using individuals (rather than diplomacy or sanc- -
' tions) to warn the Soviets that one false move will

lead to direct conflict with the United States.
There is no argument from this newspaper that the

‘Soviet’siincursion into Afghanistan isan aggressive,

imperialistic move. The Soviets are not warranted in

A their aggressive actions and they should be con-

demned. But reinstitution of draft registration is not
the answer. 1 ' I

Why, if mandatory registration is so bad, do the

students surveyed support it?

One answer could be the return by most Americans .

tothe patriotic fervor characteristic of past genera-
tions. Americans are seeing their country stepped on
by other nations,‘in particular, Iran. A small country
with a weak government is holding the United States

(a world power) and the United Nations at bay _' I

through its refusal to set the American hostages free.
Patriotism is a logical result of such a situation. ’

' ‘But; Americans must carefully respond to the in-' ~ ‘  5"

ternational situatioﬁi and beware of irrationalpolicy.

This is an election year and politicians are watching ,
opinion polls like the one conducted at Pitt (but on a 

larger scale)., If the majority of the people believe a

certain way concerning an issue, a natural result is , ~ I" 
that“ politicians will respond to‘ the electorate’s .

wishes.

Such is the case with mandatory draft registration. , A

V We do not argue with the right of students to ex-
press their opinions on national issues. On the con-

trary, freedom of speech is a basic foundation of our (‘  
‘ society. However, we are inclined to disagree with .

the 50_ percent of those Pitt students who support
registration. Perhaps students should take a closer
look at what the consequences could be.

Columnist Wrong; Life

Stephen Wohl’s article of March

Distrubing

I have been at Pitt .either as a
student or as a staff member for
every year since 1971. During the
period it has been my understand-
ing_that the Student Government
Board does not feel that it is ap-
propriate for it to take stands on
political issues. Therefore I was
disturbed when Iread that the
SGB, in what appears to be a sud-
den shift_in a longstanding policy,
had voted to support President
Carter’s proposal for reinstating
draft registration.

Even if I am mistaken in my .

characterization of what I have
described as a»“longstanding SGB
policy”—which Inight very well be
the case—legitimate questions

, still remain as to the methods by

which the Board arrivedyat its deci-
sion. According to the Pitt News,
the vote was allegedly‘ based_ on" a
“survey” of9'Pitt students in which
50 percent of those surveyed ‘ex-

pressed support for - reinstatement

‘\

i

of draft registration. We are told
nothing about the methodology of
the survey itself, outside of Mr.
Blazer’s comforting assurances
that it was “given to a represen-
tative sampling of Pitt students.”
How many students were

surveyed? How was the “sample”

chosen? What questions were ask-

ed? Where and when was the.-

survey_ taken? \
The question of the draft is ob-

viously of direct and vital concern '

to University students. Thisis, not
the place for me to discuss the
substantive issues
although >it should be clear from
this letter where I stand on the
issue. It may very will be that a
majority of Pitt students do indeed
support reinstatement of draft
registration. But certainly before

the SGB takes a stand on such a '

crucial issue we are entitled to
know more about the basis for its

decision. .And since the SGB has '
shown a new-found interest in tak- ,

ing stands on national policy
issues, perhaps it is ready to im-

mediately and ‘forcefully take a‘

position on the question of

~ No Room for the Extraordinary

‘I suppose it’s my turn to add at
least one more voice of futile pro-
test to what is happening here at

Pitt. I was surprised by the strong.

editorials in The Pitt News regar-
ding Curtisl Porter and the cartoon
showing the faculty of Yes People
all scurreying about in total
very “strong
response for a student publication
these days. '

I thoroughly enjoyed Professor’s
James D. Simmonds piece (Feb. 25)
"about yellow-sports-on-the-
classroom-floor (where the fur-
niture should be), called him, and
was again surprised that someone
like him was still here. We agreed

. that we are probably “The Last of

the Mohicans,” avanishing peo-

'. ple, a remnant of a very brief

period here when this university
was on the brink of becoming first
rate. V /
But—systematically—every
reform of the sixties has been or
soon will be extinguished. Alter-
native Curriculum was the first to
go-,_ now the attack on Black
Studies and self-designed majors
and independent studies and soon

, the’ Women’s program will feel the
turning-back-of-the-clock. We are I
rrfaking every effort to solidify our

reputation as a second rate univer-

' sity and I’m certain, if we keep at

the present course with the same
dedication we will achieve
glorious_ third-ratedness quite
soon. We’ve purged the Marxists
in our midst, now the Black
»agitator, then those who want to
direct their own education and
finally—but much more
cautiously—the largest minority
of women.

It will be easy since the whole
society is doing the same

reinstitution of selective service,
rebuilding the military, no matter
where one turns the pattern is

. there. Every film I show is falling

to pieces and we can’t afford to
buy new ones, but then I should be
lecturing and giving tests
showing films. Practically every
week’ a new directive is issued
from somewhere adding another
requirement to the students’ pro-
gram, another set of tests, more re-
quired courses-—more’ “hard
work.” .

ago this was an exciting place to

In short we have destroyed the
potential this university once had.
We are offering inferior education
to our students. If they cannot en-
radical Marxists and
Blacks in their time here then their
education is inferior. If they can-
not choose to direct their own learn-
ing, so as to finally direct their
own lives, their education is in-
ferior.» More rigid requirements,
more tests and papers and “harder
grading” has nothing at ‘all to do
with quality education.

I’m- afraid we have mediocre
people hiring people like
themselves and firing those who
are different or extraordinary.
The process is as old as'Socrates

brief ﬂowering here and now, after
that dazzling display, comes the

SGB Vote
Causes Anger

Regarding the recent action of
the Student Government Board to
support Carter’s move to reinstate
the draft, we are enraged to find
the Board once again misrepresen-_
ting the student body in order to
further their own petty ambitions.
Where was the alleged sampling of
student opinions made? ROTC?
College Young Democrats? _.The
men’s room at Danny's Pub? In-
deed, how many were polled?
Why was the poll taken before the
March 12 draft teach-in‘?

Anyone possessing the political
insight of, say, Dean Schulman,
could not help but realize that sup-
port for Carter’s draft proposal im-
plies support for Carter’s re-
election campaign, as well as his
dubious foreign policy.

Perhaps Bill Abraham took ad-
vantage of the opportunity to
,.discuss the wording of the
sycophantic SGB resolution during
his late junket to the White House.
We certainly hope there was some
purpose to the trip. “

We applaud Scott He1‘1dler’s
vote against the resolution.

We hope those voting yes are as
enthusiastic in combat as they
were in the SGB meeting.

Bertocchi’s spineless abstention. —

Raking
The Muck

We protest! We had always
thought that the succor of a college
newspaper came from muck raking.
The Graduate and Professional Stu-
dent Association is full of muck,
but so far The Pitt News has refus-
ed to rake. 1

Our dispute with GPSA was first
entombed on page four and subse-
quently ignored in two. page one
stories covering GPSA’s most re-
cent meetings. These last stories
have dwelt on GPSA’s- semi-
grandiose, and oft repeated, plans
for the future. They have read like

‘GPSA memos (the kind we pay an

administrative assistant to write.)
These stories failed to mention
some facts from the present and the
recent past. They did not mention
that at the first meeting, Director of

, Student Affairs, Andy Smith called

on‘ GPSA to settle its dispute with
the Student Bar Association. They

do not mention that at the second »

meeting, GPSA Chairman, S. La-

Mont Hughes refused to accept stu- ,

dent petitions favoring SBA’_s
withdrawl. They did not mention
that an S.B.A. proposal for
withdraw] was again voted down.
These stories also fail to mention

that the luncheons at both meetings .

"were paid’ for from student activity
fees (paid by every graduate stu-
dent). At the first meeting, over
$350 was spent to provide an invited
few with a filet mignonﬁlunchf

An undetermined amount was
spent for lunch at the sedefnd
meeting, but it must not have been
as good as lunch at the first
meeting. The crowd of 30 that sat

down to dine dwindled to about one
the end . of the meeting. '

by
_Presumably these early departures
were caused by indigestion or
boredom.

The moral is that talk is cheap
and often boring, filet mignon is
neither. We hope that in the future
The Pitt News will serve _up more

filet and less cheap fat and gristle.

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s volleyball team
willtry to continue its undefeated
play in conference competition
tomorrow afternoon when the Pan-
thers host a triangular match with
Penn and Navy.

The Panthers are coming off a
very successful weekend during
which the second year squad finish-
ed a very impressive third in the
Eastern Collegiate Volleyball

League open tournament at
Newark, New Jersey. Pitt finished
the tourney in a tie for third with
Army, behind winner Rutgers-
Newark and second place Penn
State. 1

Pitt has faced Penn a number of
times this year in tournament com-
petition and, once in a regular
season conference match. The two
Division II schools will battle it out
in the first match of the afternoon

at 1' p.m. A match between Penn

and Navy will follow, and the event
will be concluded by the Pitt—Navy
pairing.

The match—up» with Fﬂin will
begin the Panthers’ first round
competition in conference play. Pitt
has previously disposed of Penn
twice, in the Penn State Invitational
tournament early in the season and
in a match in Philadelphia three
weeks ago. In the tournament
clash,_ the Panthers outmanned
Penn by scores of 15-1 and 15-3.

These one-sided scores, however,
do not have the Panthers overly op-

Roundballer Kathy Paczkowski Isn't Forgotten Anymore

By MARIE HUFF
Pitt News Staff Writer

In the realm of athletics, spec-
tators are treated to the sensational
moves of the exceptional player, ap-
plauding their awesome ability.
Often the fans overlook - those
players that constitute -the re-
mainder of the starting five; the
“forgotten” stars. These in-
dividuals many times contribute
consistency and unselfish play to
the game, opening the door to post-
season games and team recognition.

For the past four years, Kathy Pac- ‘

National Prequalifiers Diving Meet.

“This meet will encompass all of I _

eastern states,” said Lewis. “The
biggest conpetition will come from

Pat’s brother, Joe Greenwell, and '

Mike Gurnee of Harvard.”

In this kind of competition, there I

are 80 divers on each board, and
only four will survive the intense
competition and go on to nationals.

“You have to dive really. good,

and your diving coach has to be a '

good politician,” joked Lewis.
“They judge the meet, and it’s
similar to Olympic judging where
you lean towards your guy. There
are seven judges on each panel and

they take the middle three scores.

That makes it pretty fair.”

It should be noted that Pitt’s
divers have gone undefeated the en-
tire year, quite a tribute to rookie
diving coach Julian Krug. It is the
first time this has ever been accom-

plished at Pitt. - .

“Our divers have several strong-
points,” said Lewis. “There are re-
quired dives and optional dives in
competition. Our guys are extreme-
We do
tougher dives than most other kids.

Because of this, we can come out ~

ahead in optional dives.”

A subject_ that is often mentioned
in collegiate athletics is that concer-

years of cgmpetition.

“Here at Pitt, we have to replace
three good kids,” said Lewis. “We
have 100 percent graduation this
year, which really means a lot to the
parents. All three of our seniors are
graduating, and graduating on
time.”

Paczkowski’s junior year. In just
two years she set every playing
record at the school’, and she earned
the distinction of being the first girl
in the Pittsburgh Public School
System to accept a college athletic
scholarship.

Jean Balthaser, an assistant
coach at the time Paczkowski was
recruited, said “We liked Kathy
because she was an excellent passer.
When she was a senior, she was pro-
bably the best high school player in
Pittsburgh.’ ’

Paczkowski did not disappoint
the coaches once she got here. Od-
dly, Paczkowski recorded more r'e- ,

shots on the year. She attributes
this to the difference in coaching
philosophies between Pat Wallace,
who coached her freshman year,
and the current coach, Jean
Balthaser.

“Coach Wallace really didn’t
have a set position or role for
everybody to »play,_” she said.
“Coach Balthaser more or less did,
and as a point guard I did not have
to go for the rebounds as much.”

Paczkowski was well on her way
to matching her previous totals dur-
ing her sophomore year. In just six-
teen games she had recorded 42
assists, just four short of her
freshman year. Unfortunately, she

-suffered.—ani"ankle injury that put

her out for the remainder of the

season. - .
Determined to make a comeback,

Paczkowski worked hard the entire
summer on her rehabilitation pro-

-’ gram. Sitll, shefelt that although

she returned physically sound, her
game was hurt somewhat mentally.
More pressure was added with the
loss of the other guard, Debbie
Lewis. Paczkowski came through
with the style of a true champion, as
she led the team to post-season play
and set a team record for assists
with 119 for the year. _ '

For her efforts, the team voted
her the Most Valuable Player of the
1979 season.

“That has to be the biggest thrill

I’ve ever experienced at Pitt,” said .

With the coming of this year, her’ 1 ' "

final year at Pitt, Paczkowski

found herself as the team’ captain .  i

and leader of a’ young squad.
“Kathy is more a leader through

her actions than through her words. -_.

She’s a very quiet individual,”

Coach Balthaser said. ’
This was perhaps Paczkowski’s

best year for all-around statistics,

She recorded personal bests in free ,  

throw percentage [.793], rebounds "

[71], steals [51], and.assists [I33].
Paczkowski is now the all-time

assist leader for the Pantherettes '

with 340 assists in her career. '

After graduating this year with a 3

degree in sociology, Paczowski
would like to return to graduate
school in her efforts to become a

high school counselor.

 

 

 

 

 

‘ first level behind the reserved seat area.

Now that the dust has, in a way, settled following
the resignation of Pitt basketball coach Tim
Grgurich, an analysis of the program at Pitt is in
order.

. The six-man committee formed by Athletic Direc-
tor Cas _Myslinski is to be commended for its swift ac-
tion in pursuing Villanova Coach Rollie Massimino.
Massimino was in town Wednesday, for, by his own
admission, .recruiting purposes.
mulled the Pitt job, a job he isn’t likely to take.

What would Massimino," or any Division One
coach see when he pays a visit to the _Oakland campus
and inspects the program? ‘Let’s take that look.

The first, and most obvious eyesore to ‘cross his
path of vision is the Field House, that 5,300 seat
structure up on the hill. Most big. time coaches are
used to facilities such as Kentucky's 23,000 seat Rupp
Arena, West Virginia’s 14,000 seat Coliseum and
Ohio State’s impressive St. John Arena. The Field

House is hardly a first-rate arena, and its presence‘

has, and always will be a detriment to Pitt basketball.

Then there is the basketball office, located on the
The
walkway leading to the offices (which resembles the
kind found in prisons), takes one into the _reception

area, and two offices for coaches. At last count, Pitt ‘
. had one head coach, two full-time assistants, a

graduate ‘assistant and a very loyal and dedicated
secretary. ‘ Mathematics indicate that _not every
employee has an office. (Very proficient for a-major
college basketball program.)

The offices themselves are stunning- Each comes
 complete without panelling, little elbow room, and a
beautiful paint job over the luxurious concrete block
walls. Hmmm. C

Instant Replay

By SAMUEL SCIULLO -

 

The basketball team’s locker room, located in the
bowels of the Field'House, was built during the early
1970s by a group of interested alumni whocalled

themselves the Golden Panther Rebounders. The
group raised $5,000 for the room, and was a virtual
construction crew, assisting in the actual construc-
tion of the room.

For some reason, the Rebounders were forced to
disband, and got sucked up by the Golden Panthers,
the parent group which collects all the loot into one

single pot. _(After all, it wouldn’t be good for the se- ‘

cond most important team at Pitt to maybe prosper
on its own, and advance itself past some of the minor
teams.) J T ‘

Several years ago, locker and team rooms for some
of‘ Pitt’s womens_’ teams were built, and at a cost of
slightly more than $5,000. A

Tim Grgurich and his staff were given a recruiting

budget of $15,000 for the last season, much less than .

most major powers, including two local (not Du-
quesne) rivals, each of which had a new, big name
coach at the start of the 1978-79 season.

Critics of Grgurich have pointed to the state of
Georgia, where they claim he spent too much money
pursuing a player. But besides Len McMillian, Pitt
was trying to lure Terry Fair, Michael Hunt, Ted
Benson and Avery Rawlins.‘ Five players, not one,

 "    B005-ketball Plr0Qiramn Needs SUPPOH‘ To Make Bi9 Time

and Grgurich came extremely close to landing at least
one of those other four.

Another area where Grgurich suffered from lack
of support was with the alumni. The actual number

of alumni who take an active interest in the Pitt pro— _

gram could be counted on one hand. Grgurich
became blue in the face from asking for help that he
soon had to shrug his shoulders. A new coach com-
ing in will want to be assured that he will receivefull
support from alumni and fans, whose interests will
consist of more than criticizing the coach after a loss.

The greatest tragedy of the situation is that Pitt has
now indicated its intentions to upgrade the. program
tremendously. Why now? Weren’t the funds -and
improvements possible when Grgurich was coach?

. The work of the selection process by the committee
could become testy if a successor isn’t named too
soon. As was the case in the late 1960s, when Dee
Andros and Frank Kush smeared egg all over the
faces of several Pitt administrators, a repeat ‘perfor-
mance could be forthcoming.

What if the committee is unable to land a suc-'
cessful Division One coach? Will it dip into the Divi-
sion Two ranks and reduce its enticements to a coach
who hasn’t proven himself, as Tim Grgurich has?
Grgurich leaves Pitt a winner, having won 16, 18 and
17 games during each of the past three seasons.

If the committee should become nervous, it might
consider sucking up some pride and offering
Grgurich the big time program it is now dangling
before several “big time” coaches, none of whom
ever cared a bit for Pitt.

Should Tim Grgurich still be available, Pitt might
not have to look very far for its basketball coach.

(Continued from page 7)

Pitt was the only team to
defeat the Nittany Lions in last
week’s ECVL tournament,
besides the eventual champions,
Rutgers-Newark.

The remainder of the games
on the Panthers’ schedule will be
conference matches, with the ex-
ception of another match with
Penn State, to be played at
home on April 1.

“We have another round of

conference matches remaining,

with Penn beginning the second
round,” said assistant coach
Mike Hebert. “We can’t let

down because every team could
I beat us, and that includes Penn. 0

We must be prepared to play
each game and we will be able to
handle each opponent if we play

well.”

  v....,..... Action 

Continues Tomorrow  

Hebert also had a great.de'al

of praise for the improvement I A 0

that the men’s team has made,
since they" gained varsity status

last season. Coupled with the "

women’s program (who ' have
placed number one in the East.
and number 13 in the nation for

the last two years), Pitt has cer- -

tainly turned into a volleyball

-powerhouse in the East.

“The finish that we had in the L

ECVL was very impressive,” _
said Hebert.’ “That tourney was
a prelude to the Eastern cham-
pionships and, if it is any indica-
tion of what will take place, it

would put Pitt in at least third or. _

fourth place in the East; I’m

very pleased with our program . "7

here at Pitt because, with the
women’s and men’s showings in
Eastern volleyball, we should be
looked at as a powerhouse in
this section of the country.” =
