Chancellor Litchﬁeld announced plans for an annual fund-raising
campaign to help increase the University revenue at a luncheon with stu-
dent leaders at noon Monday.

The Chancellor made this announcement while explaining to the stu-
dent leaders that the budget problem is being handled in two ways. The
ﬁrst is the cost-cut program which he said is “hopefully not being taken
from areas which affect the students.”

The second method of handling the budget problem is an increase in
revenue. Governor William Scranton has agreed that there should be an
increase in revenue, according to the Chancellor. “We would have hoped
that it would have been a little more, but it will -be an improvement," 
he said. “How much, is the question.” -*

The second way to increase the revenue is through the fund.
raising campaign. The campaign will begin Monday with the show-
ing of two ﬁlms about the University. The films, which will promote
the campaign, will be shown at the_Chancel1or’s home. They are
“The Sudden Show of Strength” and “The Gift.”

The campaign will be directed to more than just the alumni
and the immediate Pittsburgh area. It will also be directed toward
friends of the University, annual gi_vers,—Pittsburgh businessmen, the
University community which includes administration, faculty, stu-
dents, and parents of students, and to various corporations, he explained,

“Eastern schools do this regularly, but Pitt has been prevented because of
internal considerations,” the Chancellor said. “We needed special funds for the medical
and health centers. Now we can launch an annual giving drive.

“Most funds in the past have come from Harrisburg, from annual giving, and
from tuition,” he continued. “It is with the endowment that we are seriously lacking.”

g Chance11orAnnounces FundRaisingPlans

The Chancellor was referring to the fact that much of the endowment given to
the University is restricted, which means that it can only be used for the purpose spe-
ciﬁed.

In presenting the budget ﬁgures to the Student Affairs Committee Feb. 23,
Lawrence L. Monnett, vice chancellor or business affairs, explained that the endow-
ment income increased from $1,540,625 to $1,884,325 or 22.8 per cent from 1960 to
1964. He also explained that gifts and grants increased from $619,556 to‘ $983,135 or
58.6 per cent over the same period of time.

Monnett explained that the unrestricted endowment amounts to only 1.2 Per
cent of the total endowment.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld feels that the most important aspect of the campaign is
to get people involved in the University. “Too many people sit back and think that
their funds aren’t needed because they see new buildings going up.”

“If _the problem is shared it will have an important side effect,’ he continued.
“Non-ﬁnancial contributions are just as important as ﬁnancial ones.”

Dean of Students Helen Pool Rush suggested that the student campaign he called
a “Dollar a Scholar.” She feels that a dollar from the students will make them feel
they are sharing in the growth of the University.

Eric Stern, president-elect of Student Government, suggested that perhaps more
students would be interested in the campaign if student leaders helped to involve stu-
dents in the soliciting of funds. Reacting favorably, the Chancellor said: “Don’t let this
drop,” to which ‘Stern replied, “I won’t.”

The ﬁrst campaign will end July 31, the Chancellor explained and said, “We
hope to close the deficit in the foreseeable future.” .

Explaining that the University can not stand still in its development since by
nature a social institution must either go backwards or forwards, Chancellor Litchﬁeld
said, “We won't go back. We will go forward either at the same rate or a. little more
slowly.”

Visiting Professor Speaks

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Wed., March 10, 1965

At Convocation Tomorrow

Dr. Peter H. Odegard, vis-
iting Maurice Falk professor
of politics and former presi-
dent of Reed College, will be
the principal speaker at to-
mor-roW’s Honors Convoca-
tion, which will be held in
Carnegie Music Hall at 10:30 a.m.
Dr. Odegard will receive an hon-
orary Doctor of Letters degree.

An honorary degree will also
be conferred upon Lorin Maazel.
a former University student and
a distinguished musician. Maazel
will be awarded a Doctor of Mu-
sic degree.

In addition, University schol-
ars and students who have earned
academic distinction will be hon-
ored at the annual convocation.
All 10 and 11 .a.m. classes have
been cancelled for the ceremony.

Dr. Odegard, currently profes-
sor of political science at the

University of California at Berk-
eley, is at the University for the
winter trimester.

He received national recogni-
tion in 1961-62 when he taught
American Government on NBC-
TV’s Continental Classroom. He
has also published several books,
including Religion and Politics,
American Government; Theory,
Politics and Constitutional Foun-
dation, and Government; and
Politics in the American Republic.

Besides acting as consultant to
United States cabinet officials and
the Atomic Energy Commission,
Dr. Odegard has served as pro-
fessor of political science at Wil-
liams College, Ohio State Univer-
sity, and Amherst College. He
was president of Reed College
from 1945 to 1948.

A graduate of the University

of Washington who received his
Ph.D. from Columbia University,
Dr. Odegard is a former presi-
dent of the American Political
Science Association.

Maazel made his public debut
at the age of nine as a conductor
at the Interlaken Music Camp in
Michigan. The following year he
was invited by Tosoanini to con-
duct the NBC Symphony.

He has traveled extensively all
over the world, conducting such
major symphony orchestras as
the Leningrad Philharmonic, the
French National Orchestra, and
the New York Philharmonic._

Maazel recently recorded Ben-
jamin Britten’s “The Young Per-
son’s Guide to the Orchestra,”
speaking the narr.ation in French,
English, Italian, Spanish, Portu-
guese, and German.

To hold office space in the
Union an organization must be
recognized by the Student Affairs
Committee of the Uniwlffa-sity.
Space will be allocated on the
basis of need for an office the use
the organization will make of the
space allocated, and the organiza-
tion's need for maintaining a
regularly staffed. office.

Loch said: “Several organiza-
tions might share the same oﬁice,
as they may need nothing more
than .a desk or ﬁling space. In
such a case, this space could be
made available to them in a
room already being used by one
or more organizations.” Present-
ly, 33 organizations have offices
in the Union.

The Student Union House Com-
mittee chairman, Cynthia Cor-
bett, will assist in the assign-
ment of the student organization

necessary additions to the staff

in all departments

may not now be made, and, what
is more, replacements for any of

the staff who, for

son, may leave may not be ap--

3. Lack of Space

a) A most obvious need of the
library is additional space. The
simple fact that there is no more"
space to put anything and inade-
quate space in which to do any-
thing accounts for a major share
of the present inadequacies . . .

For example, the most persis-
tent criticism brought to our at-
tention—the unusually long lapse
of time between the ordering of
a book and its subsequent _ap-

pearance on shelf,

the fact that faculty frequently
cannot discover what has happen-
V ed to their requests and books—

is as much related

‘ b) Presently, in the Science Li-

Campus Libraries only minimum
professional services, chieﬂy con-
sultations concerning problems,
are available, and in the main
Circulation Department searches
for unlocated books are not en-
couraged, and faculty overdue
notices are not being sent out.

c) The present library staff has
made every effort to absorb with-
in its own means the necessary
workload to maintain services
now offered. Within a month,
however, it is anticipated that
additional staff will be leaving
the library, and that, consequent-
ly, further reductions in services
rendered must be made. Obvious-
ly, to the extent that the re-
sources of a library are not made
available to its users, to that
same extent that library does not

5. Lack of Faith and Prestige.

a) . . .aVIany of us, especially in
view of the hopeful recommen-
dations for improving the library
made by a special committee two
years ago, have been embarrassed
by questions from new faculty
and prospective faculty about our
library. Many feel thatithe Uni-
versity has misrepresented itself
in regard to its modern, adequate
library facilities. In all fairness,
we do recognize that gains were
made in 1963 and early 1964; but
once again the library is in

. According with the inadequa-
cies-which have been pointed out,
the following suggestions

are

1) That every reasonable means
be exhausted to ﬁnd and appoint
a permanent director of the Uni-
versity Libraries as soon as possi-

2) That funds be found now to
enable the library to acquire the
staff it needs, to purchase the
new serials and books it‘ needs,
and to provide the necessary
services it must have in order to
support the truly ﬁrst-rate aca-
demic program we are all work-
ing so hard to establish—-in this
regard, we urge the assignment
of funds in spite of the Univer-
sity-wide ﬁnancial situation, to
the library, in the hope that sav-
ings achieved elsewhere should
be directed here, for any tem-
porary economy in library opera-
tions —: now will obligate a ten-
fold expenditure in the next few

. . . Also, in this regard, we
urge that the library allocations
be placed at the very center of
the total University obligation,
because the library is indeed the
true core of a thriving academic
program; and also, in this regard,
we urge that authority to pur-
chase books be returned to the
head of the Acquisition Depart-
ment now, with the injunction,

if it is necessary, that only such
and such an amount may be
spent for books in such and such
a given period; t

3) That additional space he
found to enable the library to
carry out its operations efficient-
ly-—in this regard, a memoran-
dum from the acting director of
University Libraries to the direc-
tor of the Physical Plant .
concludes that space in the base-
ment of the Cathedral of Leam-
ing to be vacated by the depart-
ment of physical education is
ideally suited to the library's

needs . . .

4 and 5) Should the ﬁrst three
suggestions receive favorable ac-
tion, an automatic improvement
in services, and restoration of
faith and prestige, too, will fol-
low. Should it not be possible to
act favorably upon the ﬁrst three
suggestions, then this committee
is at a loss to suggest ways to
improve and restore
faith and prestige.

If I mightspeak a sentence or
two in my own voice, I should
like to say two more things. I
have avoided speaking to the
many questions I have received
about the date‘ when one might
expect the start of construction
of the Hillman Library, because
I know that the present crisis for
our library is in no way at all
connected with the new building
we all hope to see. Our library
needs help right now. I also very
much regret that our suggestions
have not matched in detail the
tone of the inadequacies we dis-
covered. It is so much easier to
uncover deﬁciencies than it is to
ﬁnd remedies for them. I know
there is no simple solution to
the problems I have had to des-
cribe, but it is the hope of our
committee that some discussion,
at this moment might be directed
to what, surely, is a common

Himes Letter
Called Unfair

Editor, The Pitt News:

To anyone operating under the
assumption that The Pitt News
editorial policy is guided by con-
siderations of common decency
and fair play, the presence of C.
L. Himes’ letter in the Wednes-
day, Feb. 24, issue is totally in-
explicable. _ _

Why the record of someone’s
visceral reactions should be re-
garded as meriting a column and
a half, is question enough; ques-
tionable is too weak a word for
publishing them when the polit-
ical candidate attacked had no
opportunity to reply prior to the
election.

The letter itself, ‘ now that
we've all read it, is worth ques-
tioning; it is .a piece of scurillous
fulmination such as we seldom

’see. I sincerely hope that its au-

thor, at any rate, is not so strong-
ly moved by the fear of being
inflicted with long hair and a
beard, as automatic result of
thought, that he continues to
“remain incogitative.” Some no-
tions that he might reﬂect upon
are: ’

a) That the criteria of insecur-
ity, immaturity, and ineptitude
don’t provide the nice division of
the student body he seems to
envision;

yet may not lllﬁlbb Dual: 1.1.» nu» un-
ministered to rather than mere-
ly administered? Is there free-

-dom where some are free to

screw the “successful paramet-
ers” down to the point where

‘working within them means leav-

ing things .as is?

We should also, even at the risk
of becoming hirsute, cogitate on
these matters. And while we can
demand that, henceforth, replies
appear simultaneously with the
publication of political attacks,
we can only hope that interac-
tion in the process of political
and social life will be sufficient
to give the full concept of free-
dom to those’ of us who, so ob-
viously, lack it.

Viet Nam View
Irritates Reader  

Editor, The Pitt News:

As one who at least considers
himself to be a rational Ameri-
can,‘ I am extremely irritated by
the article appearing in the
March 5 edition of The Pitt News,
advocating the withdrawal of
American forces from Viet Nam.

The ﬁrst implication of the
article is that this is a true “Peo-
ple’s Rebellion.” In other words
the people are supporting the
Viet Cong. Therefore, we have no
business interfering. I assert that
this is a lot of baloney. The peo-
ple are behind the system that

“This book combines the

one of the ablest new ﬁgures
in public life of our genera-

courage and hope to the
anxious and fearful, and to

hoped would carry them to a. successful season. Un-
fortunately, the Panthers’ performances this year

By FRANK SMIZIK

The Beatles describe the Panther bas-
ketball season just about right when they
sing “I’m a Loser.” The 7-17 record is the
worst posted by a Bob Timmons coached
team since 1950.

The season had some bright spots and
some very low points. The low mark in the
season came on‘ January 30th when the

‘ travel-weary Panthers played Dartmouth to see

which team was the worst team in the country
and the Panthers lost.

“We lacked talent this year . . , we were
loaded with inexperience,” said Timmons. Al-
though we didn’t expect great things from the
team this year I thought we’d do a little better
than we showed.

Of the six victories the Panthers did manage,
four were against Carnegie Tech and Westminster.
The other two victories came at the expense of
Massachusetts and VPI; the Massachusetts game
being on the road while the win over VPI came
in the Steel Bowl Tournament.

“Two of the best games we played were
against Massachusetts and VPI. I thought in the
game we beat VPI we hit one of our high points
of the season. At that point I thought we’d be
better than we ﬁnished,” said Timmons.

[Inconsistency was the trademark of the
hoopsters this season. Against Wichita the Pan-

. ‘ thers couldn’t bring the ball up court and looked 1

horrible. At Army the Panthers couldn’t rebound
and made only 30 per cent of their shots. At Dart-

mouth the Panthers played one of their worst all.

around games of the season.

They managed to look very good at times
also. They had good games against tournament
bound Penn State and West Virginia. The score
was close in all four games and only a wild shot
at the end of the game stopped them from defeat-
ing the Mountaineers. Their best win was the vic-
tory over Massachusetts on the road. “I’d have to
say that was our best al1-around game of the year,"
said Timmons. _

The height of the Panthers’ inconsistency
came in the game against George Washington on
February 20. The Panthers scored over 50 points
in the ﬁrst half and shot 60 per cent. In the second
half the hoopsters only made 19 per cent of their
shots and lost the game,

Inexperience Wasn’t the only factor contrib-
uting to the Panthers downfall this season. At the
beginning of the year the Panthers made only 35
per cent of their shots and to make matters worst
never got the rebound to follow up their misses.

The lack of a good rebounder wasn’t corrected

because of lack of a bench.

With all these weaknesses, Timmons had his
hands full this winter and didn’t have the most
pleasant job in the University. “We came a long

sway from the~’beginning of the season and I hope
this is indicativelof what we’ll do_ next year,”

A he said.. ’  o L, -W

   

GERRY FRANZEN
17 7 -pound Champ

By BILL CABIN

Reigning Eastern champion Leh.igh University looms as the pre-
tournament favorite to win their 18th team title at the Eastern In-
tercollegiate Wrestling Tournament (Easterns) this weekend at Cor-
nell. The Engineers have a 10-1 dual-meet record this season, and

have defeated all major Eastern schools.

Penn State and Navy were the only teams to come close, but Le-
high defeated both teams by identical 17-11 scores. Other victories
include Cornell (28-5), Syracuse (29-6), Army (21-10), and Pitt (23-6).
A 15-9 defeat by nationally-rankedi Iowa State was their only loss.

The Engineers’ strength lies in the 123, 130, 137, and heavyweight
divisions. Sophomores Mike Caruso (123) and Joe Peritore (130) and
junior Bill Stuart (137) lead the lightweight attack. Peritore and
Stuart were undefeated this season, while Caruso lost once. 7

Although neither Peritore nor Caruso were in last year’s tourna-
ment, both will at least ﬁnish as runners-up. Peritore has already
defeated every prominent 130-pounder in the East, except defending

champion Mike Johnson.

Johnson was unable to wrestle mostof the season because of a
knee injury and lack of conditioning. However, he pinned Penn State's
Steve Erber in his last match, and his experience may give him the

edge over Peritore.

Caruso, however, has lost a match and had several close ones.
Four scrappy veterans, including Tom Heniﬁ (Pitt), Terry Haise
(Syracuse), Bob Steenlage (Army), and current champ John Wind-
felder (Penn State), also wrestle at 123. Haise and Steenlage ﬁnished
second and fourth respectively last year, .and Heniif almost beat Wind-

felder this year. I

WAYNE HICKS
Reigns at 137

K

Stuart was runner-up to Johnson as a 130-pounder last year, but '

will probably remain at 137 for the tournament. Although champion
Wayne Hicks (Navy) and Frank 0’Korn, who placed fourth, wrestle
again this year, both have been defeated by Stuart. His toughest com-
petition could be Army’s Mark Scureman. Scureman was runner-up
at 137 last year, but has been wrestling at 147 all season‘.

Heavyweight John Illengwarth placed third last season and ﬁg- ‘+-
ures to place at least second this year. He has defeated all the top
-Eastern heavyweights, except Syracuse’s champ Jim Nance.

The Engineers’ Doug Koch and John Gladish won the 147 and
191-pound titles, respectively, last year, but both have graduated.
Although their loss depleted the team's middleweight division, Glenn
Amsbaugh (147) and Harley Ferguson (167) have good chances of
placing. Although Amsbaugh only had a 5-2-1 record this year, he

defeated the Panthers’ Dino Boni.

Boni placed third last year and still rates as the top contender '
for the title, since both last year’s champion and runner-up have

graduated. -

Ferguson placed second in the 157-pound division last year, and
coach Gerry Leeman may put him at either 157 or 167 for the East-

I

ems. His top oppwition at 167 would be Cornell’s Jeff Stephens and ‘

reigning champ Marty Strayer. Stephens, however, may wrestle at 157..
Lehigh could further enhance their chances by moving senior

Rich Warnke into the 123-pound position and move the other wres- _

tlers up one division. That would give them Warnke (123), Caruso
(130), Peritore (137), and Stuart (147). Warnke was a starter last
year, but Caruso has outwrestled him for the starting position this

year.

The scoringlsystem for the tournament gives a wrestler 10 points
for ﬁrst place, seven for second; four for third, and two points for
fourth. Teams also gain one point for each fall, default, or forfeit
by which their wrestlers win. Each advancement (winning a round)
earns one point and failure to enter a divsion incurs a ﬁve point

penalty.

With their six probable wrestlers placing in the ﬁrst four places,
Lehigh has an advantage over most teams. Although Pitt, Syracuse,
and Penn State each have several outstanding wrestlers, their lack
of balance has hindered them all season. If any team can achieve
that lacking balance this weekend, they could pose a serious threat.

The Panthers could easily become a serious threat, despite their
upper weight weakness. They have ﬁve men who earned points in

last year’s tournament, and coach Rex Peery feels Johnson, Boni, and 4 --

Lee Hall have excellent chances of. winning titles.

Their chances, however, rest on whether or not Heniff, O’Korn,
and Tom Baily can place in their divisions. Baily and O’Kom placed

third and fourth, respectively, last year.

Besides Nance, they have Gerry Everling (191), Haise (123),
all season. If they’re healthy this weekend, they’ll be tough.
Lew Roberts (167), and Tom Chlendorf (177). Haise placed third last
year, but has had a sporadic season. Everling won the 191-pound title
as a sophomore, but was injured last year. However, he has -had a '
good season and ranks as the top.191-pounder. 4

    Hawthorne
‘ For Hoop Playoff Position

By GERG REED
Random House defeated Hawthorne 59-40 Monday
night —in a play-off for second place in the Dorm League,
ﬁlling the ﬁnal berth in the all-campus basketball champion-

ship. The winners broke open a
tight game by scoring 11 straight
points at the start of the last per-
iod. Random will face the Glimps
in the ﬁrst round.

The combination of the re-
bounding of Bob Boucek and 6’4”

John Enterline, the ball-hawking '

of Len Fiore, and the consistent
shooting of Lou Cepanac proved
too much for Hawthorne. Ce-
panac was top scorer in the game
with 23 points. Enterline tallied
12 points, all in the second half.
Loucek and Fiore each had nine
points.

Random controlled the open-
ing tap with Cepanac hitting im-
mediately on a jump shot. He fol-
lowed with a short hook shot as
Random took a momentary 4-0
lead. Baskets by guard Joe 0’Don-
nell and center Joel Levitt tied
the game 7-7 at the end of the
ﬁrst period. The teams exchanged
ﬁeld goals throughout the second
quarter with Hawthorne holding
an 18-17 edge at the intermission.

The rebounding‘ of Loucek and
Enterline began to pay off in the
third period. They controlled
both the offensive and defensive

boards in leading Random to a
six point bul-ge, 39-33. A hook
shot by Boucek from half court
as the buzzer sounded was a sign
of what was to come.
