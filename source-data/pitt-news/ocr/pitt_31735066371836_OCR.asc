Alzheimer’s

By Joelle Latine
The Pitt News I

The phone rings. “Hello, Falk
Clinic, Nanci Keefe speaking.”

“Hi, my name is John Doe. I think
I have Alzheimer’s disease.” Nanci
Keefe, program coordinator of Alz-
heimer’s disease at the Falk Clinic,
has heard this same phrase many
times.

A five-year research program on
Alzheimer’s disease, coordinated by
Keefe and headed by Dr. Francois
Boller, is being conducted by two
schools at‘the University of Pitts-
burgh and five affiliated clinics and
hospitals.

The program consists of 300 par-
ticipants, 100 of which are control
subjects who are the same age and of
the same socio-economic status as
the other participants. The types of
tests that are given include behav-
ioral, neurological and physical
tests. These tests are given every nine
months and data collected from
them is stored in a Pitt computer for
future reference.

The part of the project being done
at the Falk Clinic is run by a staff of

- eight to 10 people. Other clinics and

hospitals working on the project
include Western Psychiatric Insti-
tute and Clinic, Presbyterian-
University Hospital, Montefiore

Hospital, Benedum Geriatric Center‘

and the Veterans Administration
Medical Center. The Pitt Graduate
School of . Public Health and School
of Medicine are also involved with
the project.

The program is funded entirely by
a $1.8 million grant from the
National Institute of Aging.

“Memory loss, confusion and dis-
orientation are just a few of the
symptoms of this disease,” said
Keefe. ‘‘It affects one to two million
Americans with an average age of
65. Some patients come to the Falk
Clinic on their own, while others are
brought by discerning relatives.”

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurolog-
ical disorder that is marked by pro-
gressive memory loss and cerebral
cortical atrophy. Because the disease
is only detectable within the tissues
of the brain, it is hard to diagnose.
“The only way to detect this disease
is through an autopsy and by that
time, it’s too late,” said Keefe. “For
now, we can only say that it is proba-
bly Alzheimer’s."

Before treatment can be adminis-
tered, a definite diagnosis must be
made. The goal of this ﬁve-year pro-
gram —— already in its second year —
is to be able to diagnose Alzheimer’s
disease. But, according to Keefe, the
research project may also conduct
experiments in the treatment
process.

The reason for the major focus on
this disease is because of the increas-
ing elderly population.

“Families go through a lot of emo-
tions, they want to help, but keep
meeting a dead end,” Keefe said. The
program offers a variety of care in
order to relieve the burden from Alz-
heimer victims.

Keefe seemed optimistic about
achieving the project’s goals within
the scheduled five-year time limit.

“Yes, we should find a diagnosis,”
stated Keefe.

Lisa Birnbach, so-called “Princess of Prep,” spoke‘ at Pitt last night.

College handbook author

makes appearance at Pitt

By Carrie Stetler and
Craig Mullen
The Pitt News

Despite the fact that Pitt students
are presented as being “boring” in
humorist Lisa Birnbach’s recent
book, a sizable crowd showed up for
her appearance last night at David
Lawrence Auditorium.

The audience seemed hostile dur-
ing the first few minutes of the lec-
ture but soon warmed up as she
traded insults with hecklers and
asked students: “Have you ever
thrown up on campus?”

The author of “Lisa Birnbach’s
Guide to Colleges” and the best-
selling “Preppy Handbook” has
been visiting colleges across the
country discussing the sexual, drink-
ing and grooming habits of today’s
students. Dressed in what she
revealed was a “.l.H. Hook skirt, a
sweater with padded shoulders and
Ralph Lauren pantyhose” Birn-

bach’s sardonic monologues and
one-liners better beﬁtted a stand-up
comedian than a 27-year-old jour-
nalist. “How many football players
are here tonight?” she asked the Pitt
audience. When no one raised their
hand, she quipped, “That’s because
they’re all eating their steaks and
driving their cars.”

While Birnbach was researching
her book, she discovered that the
most popular drinking games on
campus are “Hi, Bob” and “Chug
Boat,” based on “The Bob Newhart
Show” and “Love Boat,” respec-
tively. She explained that in “Hi,
Bob,” partiers take a drink whenever
a character says “Hi, Bob,” and in
“Chug Boat,” players consume when
the guest stars of “Love Boat” kiss.
“[‘Love Boat’ is] the only place in the
world,” noted Birnbach, “where one
minute people meet, and the next
minute they’re making out and say-
ing, ‘hey, let’s get married.’ ”

Birnbach not only discovered new
drinking games during her campus
inspections but also observed some
of the local colors at schools such as

Old Mississippi, “which has the
highest ratio of curling irons per stu-
dent in the world,” and conservative
Wheaton University, “which has a
Fire and Brimstone museum. Press
any button in the museum, and a
famous evangelist tells you you’re
going to hell."

Birnbach’s wry tone changed
toward the end of her lecture. She
encouraged today’s career-minded
students not to take college‘ too
seriously: ‘‘I’m here to tell you to
have fun,” she said. “Your parents
aren’t going to college - you are."

During a 30-minute press confer-
ence preceding her appearance,
Birnbach defended her college
guide, which has been criticized by
several schools for its innaccuracy
and ﬂippant tone. “People who like
what I say about their schools usu-
ally like the book,” said Birnbach.
“People who don’t like what I say
about their school don’t like it. lt’s
supposed to be a fun book about
college life, and it is a fun book. I
mean, people don’t complain that
Barron’s is boring but ...”

Financial incentives planned
to encourage faculty migration

By Susan Benedek
The Pitt News

To reduce the number of tenured
faculty in areas targeted under the
university’s Five-year Plan, the
administration is preparing finan-
cial incentives for some faculty to
seek employment elsewhere.

The incentives, termed Voluntary
Severance Pay Options, are ways of
reducing faculty in those schools,
departments or programs addressed
by the provost in the F ive-year Plan.

Phase two of the plan, which will
officially identify those reduced
units, will be released March 19,
according to Dr. Rodger Ahlbrant,
associate provost for planning and
development.

However, even in draft stages, the

_ voluntary severance pay option has

stirred criticism and concern among
faculty within the designated units
targeted by the provost’s prelimi-
nary recommendations.

“If the purpose is to encourage
people to leave, then the incentives
are not adequate,” stated Dr. Nor-
man Mulgrave, a faculty member
from the School of Education. “Not
too many people will take the [incen-

have a job offer,” he continued.
The voluntary severance option is
only applicable to tenured faculty
under 60 years of age in those areas
designated for substantial reduc-
tion. The amount of severance pay
would be based on years of academic
service, and the total amount is
equal to twice an individual’s con-
tracted salary at the time of separa-
tion, to a maximum of $100,000.
According to the current draft,
severance pay can be taken in a lump
sum or spread over ‘a period up to,
but not exceeding, three years. In
addition, during the period in which
severance pay is received, faculty
may continue to receive some fringe
benefits such as Blue Cross, life insu-
rance and scholarships for depend-

, ent children.

“If this constitues some sort of
compensation for years of service,
then the general consensus is that
this is not nearly enough. The carrot
is not much of an incentive," stated
Dr. Robert Mundell, co-chairman
of the University Senate’s Commit-
tee for Tenure and Academic
Freedom.

Mulgrave explained: “Would you
give up 25 years ofemployment for 2
to 3 years of job hunting? Is that
really an inducement? The purpose

tive] offer unless they  already of tenure is to promote high aca-

Mundell added: “President Wes-
ley Posvar and Provost Rodger Ben-
jamin have been trying to put Pitt in
a position where the university can
maintain flexibility in all resources.
The idea of tenure is a constraint
when trying to achieve flexibility.”

“We will be reducing size in cer-
tain units. But we will still honor
tenure,” stated Robert Dunkelman,
executive assistant provost.

In order to maintain the promise
to honor tenure, the Office of the
Provost is offering incentives such as
voluntary separation and is also

Finally, Ahlbrant stressed that
non-faculty in the units designated
for reduction will not be laid off but
will be retrained and, if necessary,
phased into other units.

Funding

By Julie Bavdek
The Pitt News

Enormous changes in government
funding for research have resulted in
many jobs being offered in science,
engineering and computers, accord-
ing to Dr. Lincoln Wolfenstein.

Wolfenstein, a professor‘ in
Carnegie-Mellon University’s phys-
ics department, addressed the Arms
Race Study Group at Pitt on
Tuesday.

The main concern that Wolfen-
stein brought to light was the moral
dilemma whether to take ajob that
could possibly entail the research

from jail

CLAIRTON, Pa. (UPI) -
Lutheran pastor Douglas Roth
said yesterdy that he is rested and
ready to do battle again with
U.S. Steel Corporation and Mel-
Ion Bank over unemployment.

Roth was arrested Nov. 13 for
contempt of court after refusing
to leave Trinity Lutheran
Church in Clairton, Pa., despite
a court order to stop preaching.
Roth said that he was “obeying
the laws of God and not man.”
The congregation was disbanded
shortly after his arrest.

After spending ll2 days in the
Armstrong County Jail, Roth
was released Monday morning.
His initial 90-day jail term was
extended because he continued
to preach through taped and
written sermons delivered by his
wife, Nadine. She was released
from the Clearfield County Jail

Roth released

Monday.

Outside the Armstrong
County facility, Roth told re-
porters that “our experience is
really the experience of the
unemployed. For them, unem-
ployment is like a jail.”

Three dissident members of
the Trinity Lutheran Church
Council were also released Mon-
day from the Clearfield jail.

Roth said he will return to the
church to hold services again.
However, he will have to preach
on the lawn in front ofthe church
because the church is locked and
protected by an electronic securi-
ty system installed by the
church’s local synod. Church
officers said Roth will face arrest
if he does.

Roth faces a disciplinary hear-
ing on March ll before a group
of church fathers.

changes job scene

and development of weapons.
“There

is an overwhelming

number of jobs being offered with
military contractors in the field of
natural science,” Wolfenstein said.
Wolfenstein went on to point out
that instructors on both the college
and high school level may choose to
contribute to the research and devel-
opment of military devices.

“It’s hard to distinguish if research
involves the military or no.t because
of the recent increases in the funding
for military research," Wolfenstein
stated. “A sizable number of well-
educated people, including current
students, will use their knowledge
for developing destructive devices.
It's up to us as faculty members to
guide these students to the correct

choices,” he added.

Another member of the discus-
sion panel, Rev. Robert White ofthe
campus ministry, commented: “As
professors, whether we specialize in
physics, English or political science,
it’s up to us to help those students
deal with ethical considerations.
Much needs to be done in the form
of career counseling.”

The panel also included a repre-
sentative from Computer Profes-
sionals for Social Responsibility.

Next month’s meeting will feature
Beverly Crawford of GSPIA, who
will speak on foreign policy in Latin
America.

Pittsburghers‘naive’ on fruit

By Nadia Moritz
The Pitt News

Pittsburgh may be the nation’s no.
1 city, but according to the Green
Grocer’s proprietor. Howie Ehrlich-
man, it‘s way behind in fruit trends.
“People tend to be naive about fruit
and produce in Pittsburgh,” said the
owner of the market, which is
located at Murray Avenue in Squir-
rel Hill.

“Fruits that are household words
in California, and a lot of major cit-
ies have never been heard ofin Pitts-
burgh. We’re trying to change that
attitude.”

The Green Grocer has been edu-
cating Pittsburghers about fruit for
the last 25 years, exposing its clien-
tele to several new and exotic fruits
each week.

“Our store may not be the fanci-
est, but our fruit is top quality,” he
said from behind a tiny, cluttered
desk. Around him are red mesh bags

of turnips and onions. He uses a
wooden fruit basket for a chair, and
the shelves that hold his papers and
files consist of stacked wooden fruit
crates.

The main floor of the market,
where customers walk amidst the
fruit, is more immaculate. Oranges,
grapefruits and five colors ofapples,
stacked and styled in rows and
pyramids, line the walls of the tiny
shop.

The Green Grocer stocks exotic
fruits year-round. Presently, the
shelves are stocked with such fruits
as cherimoya, passion fruit and star
fruit. The cherimoya, which has only
27 calories per ounce, is an oval-
shaped fruit with leaves similar to
those of the artichoke. The pulp of
the fruit, which is white, has a taste
much like vanilla sherbet. Passion
fruit, on the other hand, has a purple
tint and a hard, wrinkled skin.
Inside, you will find a taste alongthe
lines of a citrus fruit. Carambola,
also called the star fruit, is perhaps

the most attractive of the exotic
fruits. It gets its name from the star
shape that it collapses into after it is
cut open. The entire fruit. is edible,
although the rind, if not quite ripe,
will have a slightly bitter taste. Other
fruits too numerous to mention may
also intrigue you.

Ehrlichman said that one of his
objectives is to educate Pittsburgh
about fruit. “Once people are edu-
cated about fruit," he explained,
“they will get more into exotic fruits.
We would like to speed up that pro-
cess." For now, he said, the store will
introduce the new fruits slowly, lim-
iting the selection to a couple of new
fruits per week.

He added that the present clien-
tele range from the elderly to “yup-
pies" (young urban professionals).
He also said that during the Jewish
holiday Tunshuad, during which the
Jews eat five types of fruit from
Israel, and the Jewish New Year,
many people will come to the market
seeking the various kinds of fruit.

Catch-22

Sanity has prevailed, for the moment at least. in the
case of the warden of the Allegheny‘ County Jail sent-
enced to prison last Friday. Warden Charles Kozakie-
wicz is the victim of a judiciary Catch-22.

Kozakiewicz was sentenced to six months to a year in
the Washington County Jail for refusing Common Pleas
Judge Ralph J. Cappy’s order to admit a state prisoner.
The warden refused the order to comply with a federal
court order limiting the population of the jail. Caught
between a rock and a hard place, Kozakiewicz was faced
with deciding which court’s order he would disobey.

Even Judge Cappy described the situation as “some-
thing like a Woody Allen movie.” He postponed sending
the warden to jail to review the case. After reviewing the
situation, Cappy curiously called the entire proceeding
unconstitutional. He said he found his own contempt
hearing “procedurally offensive” and thus spared Koza-
kiewicz a jail sentence. ‘

This was a polite way of saying the entire case was quite
ridiculous. But it made sensational headlines for the
weekend and helped to publicize the problem of over-
crowding at the jail, a problem that has been ignored
politically for a number of years.

Judge Cappy quite rightly implied that the problem
rests with the county board of commissioners, who
“choose not to provide adequate and constitutionally
proper facilities to house dangerous felons.” He said it is
not a “proper judicial function for the court to be
involved in the political question of how big the jail must
be. Let this properly be a political decision for which the
board must answer to the law enforcement community
and to the electorate.”

' The warden said he was thankful for not going tojail,
“but it’s not the end of the story.” He said there will be
more prisoners and more refusals in the future and the
possibility of another contempt order.

The countyjail is a museum piece that should be retired
from service as a jail as soon as an alternative can be
constructed. It cannot adequately house all the prisoners
the county has. A building from the last century cannot
be expected to meet the needs of a modern society with a
much larger population. The frequent escapes from the
institution are but testimony to its ineffectiveness.

The sooner the county has a new and modern facility
capable of housing more criminals, the safer the people of
this county will be. The county board of commissioners
should quit dragging their feet and get on with the busi-
ness of building a jail.

Tears of Joy

In regard to Craig L. Fishman’s I

letter last week, contrary to popular
opinion, we did not pay him money
to mythologize us. Reading his de-
scriptions of us as neo-decadents
who “succeeded in raping the morals
and psyche of Bloomsburg,”
brought joint tears of joy to our
depraved eyes. To be_ called “left-
wing heathens” and potential child
molesters in print made our year.

Only one thing bothered us about
this utter failure at castigation:
something that stuck out as particu-
larly reckless and mean-spirited,
namely the part where he said, “I
dismissed them as belonging to
DSM category III, 295.32 ~— para-
noid schizophrenia, especially con-
sidering their unfocused anxiety,
argumentativeness and fear of
homosexuals.”

First of all, we may have exhibited
all the latter characteristics, but that
in no way adds up to schizophrenia.
More importantly, though, labeling
someone a schizophrenic according
to official medical classifications
without ﬁrm grounds for doing so is
a serious matter. Real doctors cer-
tainly don’t engage in such irrespon-
sible and potentially destructive
behavior. I’m sure Mr. Fishman
didn’t learn to publicly classify
someone as psychotic in medical
school, of which he so proudly and
prominently proclaimed himself a
student at the end of his letter.

Calling us paranoid schizophren-
ics was a slimy gesture. Well, Mr.
Fishman, you and your DSM III are
not cute or playful, just unethical
and libelous.

Correct

the Course

It is finally time to put S. B.
Tomasic on the correct course of
human events. Through his ram-
blings and contradictions in past let-
ters to the editor, Tomasic has once
again proven how single-
mindedness can distort reality. I will
not attempt to say that I am a com-
plete authority on this subject, but
then, neither should Tomasic.

In his latest letter to the editor,
Tomasic asks that if the Communist
regime in the Soviet Union is so ter-
rible, “where are the Kondraty

Bulavins, the Ivan Bolotnikovs, the '

Stenka Razins and the Emelyan
Pugachevs, who, from 1607 to 1774,
led massive peasant revolts against
the evil and despotic Czarist
regimes?”

Well, To masic, like all people who
lived in the 17th and 18th centuries,
those peasant leaders are dead. To

suggest ‘that the networks bf”ro'ad's,' °

but 41»  

 So flimsy were

 
  

excuses macle . '~\-

as luilcions Climbed. “E

communications and internal secu-
urity forces of l7th- and 18th-
century Russia are anywhere
comparable to those employed by
the present day Soviet Union is not
only ridculous, but asinine. There is
no possible way for a revolt to bet
beyond its embryonic stages in
today’s U.S.S.R. The prohibitive
manner in which those who speak
out against present—day leaders are
treated forestalls any or all chances
of a “peasant” revolt.

Tomasic defends the purges of the
1930s by explaining that they
focused mainly on the “intelligen-
cia.” In the eyes of Tomasic, I guess
it makes the purges acceptable then.
Let us add the fact that forced collec-
tivization (and the subsequent fail-
ures of this design — witness the
number of times the U.S.S.R. has
come up short in realized grain pro-
duction, as opposed to projected
wants and needs of the people) and
the ineffectual uses of Soviet farms
caused much suffering and starva-
tion among the Soviet Union's com-
mon people.

The Soviet system is not unani-
mously agreed upon by those who

‘ live within the U.S.S.R.‘s borders.

Otherwise, dissidents and political
asylum seekers would not exist.
Many people inside the Soviet
Union consider themselves first and
foremost Ukrainians, or Uzbekis-
tans, or Byelorussians, or Estonians,
etc. I do not contend that the aver-
age Soviet citizen is any more sinis-
ter than an average American. But
why does Tomasic feel compelled to
defend them regardless of what his-
tory bears out? Does Tomasic have
an ax to grind with someone or
something? Has he carried this chip
on his shoulder so long as to disavow
any negative statements against his
beloved Soviets? I hope Tomasic
rethinks his opinion on world his-
tory so as to see both the benevo-
lence and malevolence in the Soviet
system and its people. And like
Tomasic, I too shall tell my children
and grandchildren so.

the Pitt fight song, “fight Pitt,

ﬁghtl”; then there is the now-
infamous “cheer” (sort of) for the
opponent’s starting lineup. It’s wild:
When Pitt scores their first basket,
everybody throws all kinds of blue
and gold streamers and toilet paper
all over the court. The officials just
stop the game and take time out to
clear off the ﬂoor.

The cheerleaders had lots of good,
bouncy routines, the men’s glee club
did a good job on the national
anthem, and to add to the fun, CBS
was there, and President Posvar
even went around and waved to eve-
rybody. Ihis is tlTe'W‘2Yy 'i't"o'ugl1't"to'Be
and students should always be able
to get tickets for free ’cause this is
about the best time there is to be had
at a Pitt student activity. And 'what a
game it was!

Pitt really plays together. They-

fire each other up and they’re just as
proud to make a slick pass to a team-
mate inside and you can see it when
they’re running back down the
court.

They played some killer defense,
and when the seniors got in, they
played great. When Roy (Chipman)
called them out of the game one by
one in the second half, they got
standing O’s and hugs from team-
mates and coaches.

I loved the plays, the slams, break-
ing the press, and the whole team
played great, but I just could not
believe Charles Smith; that’s what
l’ll remember most of all.

He did everything like an artist:
He was moving, pushing and fight-
ing, using his arms and moving his
feet the whole game, then he’d get
the ball and fly up alone in the air
and leave the crowd down below. He
was so tough on both sides of the
floor. The crowd loves him and you
can tell how much his teammates
love him. He was so cool, always
giving encouragement and high
fives.

Pitt just seems like a really close
team. l’ll never forget this one play:
In the first half, Villanova still had a
chance. A guard took the ball near
the corner and Charles Smith was
working in near the hoop with
Pinckney all over his back, and
another guy underneath helping out,
but this was right in front of me sol
could see Smith was smiling and
waving for the ball, going, “Yeah,
yeah!” He’s got two guys all over
him, but he went down low and he
wanted that ball. I think the guard
was a little surprised, but he fired it
in to him. Smith took the ball,
turned around somehow, leaped up
in the air and dropped it in. Needless
to say, the crowd went nuts.

The team looked great and it was
a great time exactly the way it ought
to be.

(Editor’s Note: This is the second
section of a two-part series about
patrolling with the Oakland police.)

On Sunday, lentered the Oakland
Police Station No. 4 once again with
tension and apprehension. I was
assigned again to Officers Franz and
Stack. I had mixed emotions. First
of all, I really wanted to patrol Oak-
land, not Hazelwood, but I also felt
comfortable with the two officers I
had patrolled with the night before. I
accustomed myself to the fact and
cheerfully entered Mr. Donut (Pan-
cake Kitchen was closed.) with the
two officers for coffee that I now
knew was necessary to stay awake, if
nothing else.

The night was extremely quiet,
and patrol was just about all we did.
However, as we came back to the
station to drop me off, someone
ignored a stop sign and almost hit
the side of the police car. I really got

nervous, but the policemen had the _

situation well in hand. After turning
around and pulling the man over,
the officers asked for his owner’s
registration and driver’s license.
Checking his record with down-
town, the driver came away clean.
The officers merely served him with
a ticket. They were very courteous
and much more understanding of
the man’s position than I was. All I
thought about was how glad I was to
be alive, but they seemed unaffected
by it. They were not kidding when
they said they cannot really let any-
thing bother them. Once again, I
promised to be back on Friday for
the busiest shift — 7 p.m. to 3 a.m.
—- with car no. 43. With that in
mind, I managed to wait until Fri-
day night for the real excitement.
On Friday, I started off on my
trek to the station, where once again
I saw Lt. Joyce, talking to him for 30
minutes until the officers working
the 7-3 shift came on. At 6:40 p.m.,
the first officer, Mike Kudrav,
walked in. While he maintained the
austere, hard exterior ofa cop on the
outside, he talked to everyone on the
streets all night, waved to everyone
and really seemed to care about all
the people with whom he came into
contact. The second officer was
Linda Wittmer. She wasn’t very dif-
ferent from Officer Kudrav, except
that her interior was a little harder;
she believed in strict law and order in
courteous and compassionate as an
courteous and compassionate as an
officer can be without becoming
emotionally involved in every case.

From Where I Stand/ Toby Sanes
On Patrol with Oakland’s No. 4

The night started off with a report
that a man both officers knew well
was walking around in Hazelwood
with a gun. We never did find him,
but we had to be on the lookout at all
times. We did occasionally check his
haunts and other areas known to the
officers as hangouts for many ofthe
lawbreakers whom they are familiar
with in Hazelwood. The officers had
both worked the shift for a number
of years. They informed me that the
same people commit the majority of
crimes over and over again. Most
lawbreakers, at least the ones they
deal with, are repeat offenders.
“After one crime, there are a small
number who do change over onto
the right side ofthe law, but after the
second or third time they have been
picked up, forget it. They are gone,”
one officer said.

The comments I got concerning
media portrayal of police, if they
thought it was fair at all, were realis-
tic in their assertions that the press is
a business and their goal is ratings.
Therefore, to achieve these ratings,
it only makes sense that what is
newsworthy and most interesting to
the public will be shown. “They have
to make the news marketable,” was
one comment.

I noticed that everyone on the
streets, especially the kids, waved at
us. This happened all night. I don’t
know why I particularly thought this
was strange, but I did. One of the
officers pointed to a kid and asked
me how old I thought he was. I said,
“ Oh, about I0.” They laughed and
said he was I3 years old and had
been walking around the night
before with a loaded pellet gun.

There were also lots of girls, look-
ing like 10-year-old Revlon models,
hanging out on the streetcorners.
They were between the ages of I2
and I7 and were Iookingfor any type
of action they could find. They were
not hurting anyone, though, and
they were polite to the officers. What
can be done? It is a real problem that
needs help.

After leaving the main drag of
Hazelwood, we stopped at the repair
shop in Oakland that works on
police cars. There I met two of the
plainclothes cops from the No. 4

precinct. I felt like I was meeting
Kojak.

We then got a call for a domestic
disturbance back in Hazelwood. It
was a husband and wife who were in
the process of getting a divorce. The
husband, who had a drug problem,
had cleared the house that they both
owned completely of furniture.
When we arrived, I glanced into the
kitchen. All the cabinets, and even
the sink, had been dismantled! I was
under the impression that the hus-
band had fled somewhere, but upon
entering the living room, I was sur-
prised to see him there. The calm-
ness of his attitude struck me.

He invited one of the officers into
the dining room, where we observed
an open bag of marijuana. The wife
then entered the room and began
handing the officer other drugs and
paraphernalia from the one bureau
left in the dining room.They arrested
and charged him with possession of
illegal drugs with intent to sell.

Our next destination was the Pub-
lic Safety Building (where traffic
tickets are sent). This is where the
fun part of the night began. All the
officers in Pittsburgh have to go to
there with the lawbreaker they pick
up to file reports. I was stuck in a
room for an hour-and-a-half while
they filed their report. Then I got the
grand tour of the telephone room,
the stolen cars computer room, the
dispatch room and the records
office.

On leaving the building, I was
rushed through the cell block area. I
got to look from outside. I decided
that this was the only way I ever
wanted to see a cell block, and not as
a criminal sees it.

The night was capped off with a
burglar alarm going off on Craig
Street. We checked it out tho-
roughly and found no break-ins. We
packed it in and headed back to the
station. _

I thanked the officers for making
this story one ofthe most interesting
I have ever reported. The moral of
my story is this: The police are
friends, not enemies, so the next
time you see one patrolling, say “Hi”
or put out a hand. I think they
deserve respect and cooperation.

About Town/]. Stephen Lewis
Two Plus Two Equals Five

On any given day, it’s possible
to pick up any one of Ameriea’s
leading newspapers and see an
advertisement saying, “Buy
stock in America. Buy bonds."
Every Saturday it’s possible to
hear the president’s weekly radio
address on the current state of
the country. The Columbia
Encyclopedia has a chart of flags
for every nation.

For some reason, people
throughout the world see and
hear these things and pretend
that there is nothing wrong with
them. Don't the people of the
world know that there is no such
‘thing as “society?” Don’t they
know that there is no such thing
as. an “organization?" Don’t they
know that there is no such thing
as a “country?”

Could it be that after the thou-
sands of years that man has lived,
he still has not discovered that
there is nothing real beyond his
own mind? It must be so, for man
is still clinging ﬁercely to patches
of grass and clumps of trees
which have existed for centuries
before he found them, and he is
still inclined to call them his.
Men still look for virgin soil and,
finding no one there, say, “This
land is mine. No trespassing!"
They build houses and buildings
on that land and call it an “insti-
tution.” When the buildings have
been completed,they tell friends
and family that they can buy into
this glorious thing by putting
selfish concerns aside.

It is not this, however, that is

the greatest horror. The greatest
horror is that people do put their
selfish concerns aside.

What does it mean to be so
selfless? What does it mean to
willfully ignore the dictates of
one‘s own mind in favor of the
dictates of another’s?

Here in the America of the
l980s —— the land of do not tear,
fold, spindle or mutilate, the land
of Jane Fonda, and the land of
“pulling together" —— it means
picking up a few extra dollars or
getting a good grade to impress a
future employer. Being coopera-
tive means not rocking the boat.
It means being a team player and
supporting the team no matter
where it tramples or what morals
it violates.

Despite our greatest technol-
ogy and the repeated admoni-
tions of wise men throughout the
ages, we modern men have
reached the height of all evil. We
have begun to bandy the word
“cooperation” about as if it were
the word “truth” and, of late,
have been want to bandy the
term “self-interest” about as if it
were not the whole of freedom
that it is. _

If, with the wealth of contrary
information that we possess, we
still speak of self-interest as a bad
thing, blame not reason. Instead,
blame some men’s lust for lying
and others’ lust for laziness that
is so powerful that it seems too

_ much work to argue when a man

says that what is green is red or
that two plus two equals five.

The Pitt News

The works of 18 dynamic and
diversified artists are featured in an
art. exhibit entitled “Contemporary
Art of the Dominican Republic.”
The exhibit is on display at th Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Art Ga lery,
Frick Fine Arts, through March 24.

All the art on display is from the
private collection of Dr. and Mrs.
Bernard H. Grossman. Dr. Gross-
man was surprised to find such
highly developed art in such in
impoverished country.

“It is a grossly underdeveloped
country,” he said, “but their art is so
sophisticated. I went to a museum
there and expected to find the usual
island art and did not think I would
find such developed works.”

ZELDA’S

Grossman and his wife have trav-
eled to the Dominican Republic on
several occasions.

Ambassador Marianne de Tolen- 3‘

tino came to Pittsburgh to help kick
off the show last Thursday. As an art
historian, she is trying to promote
Dominican art in the United States.

“One way that we are promoting
art from the Dominican Republic is
through a museum, the "OAS, in
Washington D.C.,” Tolentino said.
“Also, there are seven collectors in
the United States who buy Domini-
can art. And they have been greatly
pleased with such art.”

John Frechione, assistant director 
for communications, added, “It is »

hoped that this exhibit of works of
art from the Dominican Republic
will contribute to a greater under-
standing and appreciation of the
people of the Latin American

country.“ _

Safely inside the David Lawrence

the house. Several evergreens, a
Norway spruce and a full—sized dog-
wood tree highlight the garden.
There is a miniature cascading
waterfall and pond, complete with a
footbridge and four ducks. “Ameri-
cana" is how Santorro described his
design. The effect of the garden
emphasizes the house’s unique style.

Architect Elbert O. Speidel
designed the 1,500-square—foot
home that sells for under $60,000.
The home — built and furnished to
accommodate the lifestyle of an
imaginary family with one teenage
son —— includes two decks, an L-
shaped living room, a master bed-
room with a bath that connects to
the second bedroom, a powder room
and a spacious kitchen separated
from the dining room by a kitchen
bar. Two doors in the kitchen lead to
a pantry and a washer/dryer area.

Clerestory windows in the living
room offer a view of the garden.
Light pours in through the windows
of the cathedral ceilings in both bed-
rooms. A skylight in the master
bathroom looks over a Jacuzzi
whirlpool spa.

“The challenge to build the ‘Af-
fordable American Dream House‘
for this year’s show came through
the media,” said John DeSantis,
:xecutive director of the show.
“Each year people looked at the

house, said it was beautiful and took L

Audit displeases
PAT

PITTSBURGH (UPI) —~ A
top official of the Port Authority
of Allegheny County has
responded to a preliminary audit
critizing the agency for not using
more cost-effective methods in
its purchasing procedures.

PAT executive director Wil-
liam Millar responded Sunday to
a report published in The Pitts-
burgh Press stating that the U.S.
Office of the Inspector General is
questioning $4 million worth of
purchases made by PAT’s Oper-
ations Division between 1982
and 1984.

The audit is being prepared for
the Urban Mass Transportation
Administration, which provides
over $10 million to PAT for
operating expenses. The audit
charged that the $4 million was
spent on such items as office fur-
niture and spare parts, and that
PAT overspent or did not use the
best procedures to purchse the
items.

Millar said the audit leaves the
impressionthat the agency spent
more than it should have for pro-
ducts and services, and that this
is not true.

He said this year’s home is practi-
cal for everyday living, easy to main-
tain, has plenty of space and luxury
and is affordable. g

DeSantis claimed that the house is
“shaking people up” in a positive
way. He felt that people are becom-
ing more aware of the choices they
have when looking for a new home.

Other activities are also going on
at the convention center. This year’s
NeighborFair recreates a town
square, featuring booths and exhib-
its from approximately 50 Pitts-
burgh neighborhoods. Visitors are
welcomed by citizens of each com-
munity and invited to visit with
them. Fineview won last year’s
award for most creative exhibit and
best representation of its communi-
ty. The four-generation community
of 4,000 overlooks Pittsburgh from
Nunnery Hill on the North Shore
and boasts one church and two_gro-
cery stores.

Other neighborhoods sell deco-
rated Easter eggs, promote local
house tours and tally votes on areas
of the city. Polish Hill claims to be
the neighborhood with the steepest
streets. The Urban Redevelopment
Authority will test your Pittsburgh

The best piece in the show is Jorge
Severino’s “Mi abuelo, el papa”(my
grandfather, the pope). Severino
painted this piece with the intention
of giving it to Grossman.

Referring to this piece, Grossman
said: “In Latin America, blacks are
considered the lowest class and are
given only menial jobs. Severino is
attempting to dignify the blacks in
white standards. He paints the pos-
tures of the head so delicately that
you would think he was painting
Spanish royalty. In reality, his
grandfather was probably a share-

cropper.” Luis Romero is another
interesting artist. He paints surreal-
istic pictures that remind one of
Dali’s work and incorporates pos-
tage stamps and clips of photo-
graphs into his art. This technique of
using stamps is very creative, and
one must look closely to see that it is
actually a stamp and not part of the
actual painting.

The show is being hosted by the
Center for Latin American Studies
with support from the Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation. Laura Creery,
a student at Pitt, is the show’s guest
curator. The show was installed at

the Fine Arts 102 class under the
direction of Matthew Roper and
David Wilkens.

This is one of the better shows to
come to the University Art Gallery
this year. The art is so diversified
that anyone can enjoy it. It features
surrealism, realism, folk art and
some sculptures.

Two of the sculptures are the rear
ends of a bishop and a movie star. .
These are so interesting that visitors
of the gallery can’t help but touch
them.

Gallery hours are Tuesday to Sat-
urday 10-4; Sunday 2-5; closed

The Pitt News, Wednesday, March 6, I985

Fans, cameras, basketball

Garden

League

lacks

access

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

Many self-proclaimed basketball
experts across these United States
have named the Big East as the top
collegiate basketball conference in
the nation. No argument here. With
three teams in the Top 20, including
top-ranked Georgetown and
second-ranked St. J ohn’s, the supre-
macy is evident, but the time has
come for the Big East to match big-
time organization with big-time
basketball.

Of late, trying to put together a
story on Big East basketball has
been about as fun as going on vaca-
tion in Beirut. Big East teams, with
the exception of the University of
Pittsburgh, have a habit of making
life difficult for the press.

Viewpoint

0 Following Pitt’s destruction of
Villanova at the field house last Sat-
urday, Coach Rollie Massimino
closed his locker room to the media.
In addition, during the week pre-
ceding the Pitt-Villanova game,
Massimino put a gag order on all his
players, disallowing any perspective
interviews with the media.

0 Massimino, in the ever-
protective shadow of Villanova
Sports Information Director Craig
Miller, answered about five ques-
tions following the blowout, then
high-tailed it out of the field house
press room. He offered no addi-
tional comments, and some of his
more enlightening quotes were:

1. “Pitt played very well."

2. “Charles Smith played very
well."

0 Massimino again —— this time, he
hung up on The Pitt News during a
telephone interview in which his last
statement was, “Don’t put words in
my mouth!” The interview was con-
ducted Sunday, after the Big East
Tournament seedings were
announced.

0 Enough about Massimino, now
St. John’s. For several days preced-
ing the second Pitt—St. John’s
matchup, The Pitt News made
efforts to set up an interview with St.
John’s center Bill Wennington. Set
up through St. John’s Sports
Information Director Katha Quinn,
Wennington was supposed to phone
The Pitt News at a set time on a set
night. (This is standard procedure
for telephone interviews with many
collegiate athletes.) The call never
came. No problem — something
could’ve come up. Quinn was called
the next day to reset the interview,
and everything was set for that
night. But once again, the call never
came.

0 Georgetown coach John
Thompson protects his players from
the media so it will not effect their
performance in the classroom. No
problem with that, but what about
his post-game locker room policy?
(The media is allowed 15 minutes
with the players, exactly 15 min-
utes.) Are his players that bogged
down with their studies that the
locker room is closed after 15 mm-

utes‘? Do they open textbooks as
soon as Georgetown Sports Infor-
mation Director Bill Shapland is
done hurrying the media out of the
Hoya locker room?

East should take some lessons from

ball Smith and Coach Roy Chip-

from a coach like Chipman, who is
always gracious in victory or defeat.

Several weeks ago, after a loss to
Georgetown that saw Pitt basketball
reach depths it had not seen in a
while, Chipman kept a cool head
and was as gracious as ever.

Panthers ready for

Villan ova rematch

page 11

By Mark A. Slndler
The Pitt News

It is the widely pronounced mecca of college basketball. The
nation’s top conference couldn't imagine holding its sixth-annual
tournament anywhere else.

The Big East never has. This time around, though, the hope is that
Madison Square Garden suppresses a big yawn before Saturday
night.

For now, the main attraction is the anticipated tug-of-war between
St. John’s and Georgetown. This rematch of one week ago seems
inescapable because other league teams have shown mediocre ten-
dencies all year. Will select fans — the Garden stub holders - fidget
between now and 7 p.m. Saturday?

Tomorrow’s Georgetown-Connecticut opener at l p.m. will
intrigue until Patrick Ewing initiates things with another dunk.
Ditto for the St. John’s game later when tonight’s preliminary
winner attends the Walter Berry Camp. In between is another
first-rounder between Syracuse and Boston College, collectively
losers of six of their last eight games.

Fidget, fidget.

Which leaves the Pitt-Villanova sequel at 9 p.m. - the day's
darkhorse event for fans either still hanging around or waiting for
tipoff. It should be a doozy, perhaps the game before Saturday. Just
four days ago Wildcats coach Rollie Massimino surrendered early
in the second half before an 85-62 loss and  uh, that’s enough
introduction.

“There’s no way it can be more packed than at Syracuse or here at
the arena,”.Coach Roy Chipman said, hesitantly looking forward
to tomorrow night.

“As I told the players, this is no longer a young team. We’ve
played 27 times. [The statement] that this is a freshman team has
gone down the tubes.”

The starting lineup has changed the last three games. Except for
freshman Charles Smith (15.2 ppg, 8.2 rpg), the new starters are
almost personally responsible for Pitt’s first eight-win season in the
league. «

Amid a 2-1 resurgence the last three games, forward Darryl Shep-
herd (5.7, 2.8) has scored 39 points in his first-ever starts. Joey David
will also start for the fourth straight time, again replacing Curtis
Aiken at the point. Beside him is on-again off-again starter Demetreus
Gore, a 42-percent shooter second on the team with 47 assists.
assists.

“I like the way Joey and Demetreus are playing back there,”
Chipman said. “We’re able to swing the ball quickly. They're doing
that and getting us out of traps.”

A tossup remains at center, for which Andre Williams (10 points,
eight rebounds Saturday) and a rugged Matt Miklasevich are vying.

For the short-term Chipman has been satisfied. Now comes the
hard part, of reckoning with a Massimino whoselatest coaching
tactics have been reproachable.

“Hopefully, we won’t be going in cocky,” Shepherd said, “feel-
ing we can do what we did [Saturday]. We have to make things
work. Early, [if] we get out front, we'll haveamuch better chance of
winning. This is not really a comeback team.”

In the two teams’ first meeting on Jan. 29, the Panthers never had
a chance against the ’Cats. Ed Pinckney and guard Dwight Wilbur
combined for 34 points and 13 rebounds to seal it 70-63.

Uncertainty currently prevails. For 17 minutes on Saturday, five
starters stewed in their juices. Pitt had run up a 32-point lead at one
point, in front“of five’ players accustomed to averaging about 33
minutes per game.

Is dissension imminent? Or is payback time short in coming?

Either way, tomorrow’s 9 p.m. contest is one of the can’t-miss
variety, approaching the variety that a championship game later on
represents.

“It’s the premier game, something everybody should be proud to
be a part of,” Chipman said.

CONFERENCE

1984 Pitt football season.

season.
In the midst of an 0-4 start, Coach

F oge Fazio did not shield his players
from the media, nor did he himself
shun the media, the characteristics
of a class program; he showed grace
under pressure. Granted, Pitt was
not all that informative during the
coaching ﬁrings and hirings, but
overall, access to the players and
Fazio was easy throughout the

So maybe Pitt should hold a
seminar for the schools of the Big
East on how to run a major college
sports program. After all, they are
the class of the conference. Mean-
while, it is time for the Big East to
begin promoting the conference at a
level equal to the basketball that is
played.

Pitt legend Mike Ditka:

Settling down in Chicago

series on Pitt graduate and current
Chicago Bears head coach Mike
Ditka)

The play was ending as so many
running plays end in a practice, with
a pile of bodies several feet deep and
a few yards wide. Free safety Glenn
Lehner ran to the ball from his def-
ensive position deep downfield. By
the time he got there, the shrill sound
of whistles signalled the end of the
play. From somewhere behind
Lehner rushed Mike Ditka, Pitt’s
tight end. Ditka blindsided Lehner,

remarkable about these stories is not
that they are told, but the vast
number of them that are true.

Ditka was recruited out of Ali-
quippa by then Panther coach John
Michelosen. He lettered in football,
basketball and baseball. He won the
Charles C. Harting Award for out-
standing contributions to Pitt
athletics in 1960, his senior year.
That same year he was named to the
first team All-America squad. He
was the stuff of which blue and gold
legends are woven.

time when blast furnaces put food
on the table and fathers put respect
in their sons. In local lingo, Ditka
would be called a “shot and a beer
kind of a guy,” fitting because Ditka
almost ended up a boilermaker at
United State Steel’s Aliquippa
works. Like millions of other steel-
town boys in the 1950s, Ditka heard
the mill call to him. It was not the life
he wanted, but at the time it seemed
like the only one he would have.

“At that time the mill seemed like
a good idea,” Ditka said in a recent
interview with The Pitt News. ‘‘I
know my parents couldn’t have
afforded to send me to college. I
guess what would have happened
was that I would have tried to work
my way through school some way.”

But Ditka’s was a different des-
tiny. For him, unlike so many of his
classmates, life did not revolve
around the millgate. Ditka had what
none of them possessed —— that pre-
cious ability to excel on the football
field. Ditka was stronger, faster and
tougher than the other kids. He was
every cliche you’ve ever heard about
gifted athletes, and he escaped the
mediocrity of sweating it_ out
beneath the smokestacks through
the tiny crevice called college
athletics.

play pro football came, I took it, and

Hockey team
loses to CMU

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News

The Pittsburgh Hockey Club will
have to wait another year to capture
the championship trophy after their
4-3 loss to CMU in the first round of
the playoffs Sunday. The Panthers
had defeated CMU already twice
this season but not without
difficulty.

“We walked all over Duquesne
(the first place team in the league)
easier than we beat CMU,” stated
right wing Jim Godwin. But Pitt was
unable to hold off the CMU attack
on Sunday. “It’s not that we played
bad,” continued Godwin. “CMU
has a good team. Itjust wasn't meant
to be."

The Panthers took an early lead
and were on top 2-0 at the end ofthe
first period. However, CMU came
out in the second period and retal-
iated by scoring four goals within
minutes, leaving the Pitt skaters
stunned. The Panthers counter-
attacked and narrowed the CMU
lead to one, but they were unable to
regain control of the game.

“It’s disappointing having lost.

We had a real good year and it seems
like we wasted everything now,”
commented center Jim Lang, who
led the league with 61 points this
season. “We never reached our full
potential. We were never able to put
everything together at once. Sunday
was tough —- to be winning and then
to give up four quick goals. We were
sleepwalking through the second
period. It was like they played and
we watched. I have to give CMU a
lot of credit. They could have
thrown in the towel after they got
behind, but they played harder and
we let up. Losing Jim Owens forthat
game really hurt, too, because his
line was playing really well, and then
to lose him really hurt.”Owens, who
finished the season with 40 points,
suffered a knee injury in a recent
scrimmage with the Junior Pens and
was unable to play in Sunday's

game.

“We were shorthanded half ofthe

we killed them in the first period,
they killed us in the second and out-
shot us 17-3, and we killed them in
the third — wejust got a lot of bad
breaks.”

With two minutes left in the game,
the score was 4-3 in favor of CMU,
and the Panthers scored what they
thought was a goal which would
have tied the game. But the goal was
ruled no good by the officials. “I
think it went in," argued co-captain
Damon Brown. “The ref who made
the call made some other crucial
penalty calls that were borderline.
But, yeah, that goal was in. We
didn't play with as much intensity as
we usually play. I guess we all had
the playoff jitters.”

Brown received a knee injury in
the last five minutes of play and was

The taming of the Bear:

Ditka’s road to the top

continued from page fourteen

I think it’s worked out well. This is
what I've always wanted to do.”

From his All-America senior year
at Pitt, Ditka went to the Chicago
Bears and was named NFL Rookie
of the Year, hauling in 56 passes for
1,076 yards and 12 touchdowns.

During hisplaying days in the pro
ranks, Ditka lived up to the promise
he showed for two-and-a-half sea-
sons at Pitt Stadium. He was named
All-Pro four times during his Chi-
cago years before finishing out his
career with stints in Philadelphia
and Dallas.

Under the wide Texas sky and the
wider brim of Tom Landry’s hat,
Ditka found out what Chuck Noll
refers to as one’s life’s work. Ditka
stayed in Dallas and joined Coach
Landry’s staff as an assistant coach
in charge of special teams and
receivers. It was a job Ditka would
hold for five years.

During those years, Ditka’s repu-
tation for being as tough a coach as
he was a player grew. He was fiery
and emotional. Landry seemed his
antithesis, cool and detached. It was
as though Ditka lived football while
Landry keenly observed it from
behind his steely eyes.

Ditka, however, knows adifferent

local distributor’

Landry. “He [Landry] is emotional,
too. Hejust controls it better than I
do. If you don’t show emotion,‘
you’re just not human; you’re a
rock." And Ditka is anything but a
rock. He is more a volcano, threat-
ening to erupt at any moment, spew-
ing his verbal ash on anyone or
anything that might incur his wrath.

“At times,” he said, “I wish I
wasn‘t like this [hot-tempered], but
at other times I wouldn’t want to be
any other way. I think that in the last
three years I’ve made improvements
in controlling my temper, but I'm
still not at the point I want to be with
it.”

Throughout his often tumultuous
playing and coaching career, Ditka
has been associated with some ofthe
greatest names in pro football his-
tory, names like Landry, George
Halas, Gayle Sayers and Walter
Payton.

When asked to name one player
or coach who had the most influence
on him, Ditka goes back to Ali-
quippa and his high school football
coach. “Every coach has influence,
but one I would say is Carl Ashbin in
high school. He had me at a very
critical time. My habits and values
were being formed, and he pointed
me in the right direction.

“When I think of all the coaches
I’ve been involved with —— Michel-
osen, Landry, Halas — I see very
different approaches among them,
but they all have a sameness about
them, too. They are all innovators
and teachers. A coach has to be a
teacher.”

In 1982, Ditka was given his
chance to become a teacher when
Bears owner George Halas made
Ditka the last head coach he would
ever hire. Ditka took control of the
Bears.

unable to finish the game. “You
can’t take that kind of person from
the game,“ stated Pitt head coach
Jim Owens Sr. “Damon is really
good. When he goes out on the ice,
he makes things happen."

The Panthers have recently been
plagued with various injuries which
have been detrimental to the teams
performance. The injury list
includes not only Brown and Owens,
but defenseman Tom Dieffenbach,
who has been uable to skate for three
weeks due to a torn knee cartilege.
Also, right wing Pete Barbara was
playing Sunday with a shoulder
injury while Jim Godwin continued
to skate with a pulled hamstring.

“That’s one bad thing about this
being our first year back in the
league,” explained Coach Owens.
“A lot of the teams like CMU,
Duquesne and Gannon have had
much better conditioning than we
have. With the long haul, the injuries

did take a toll on us.”

The club ended the season 17-3-1,
and according to Owens, this record
is much better than what the team
had expected. “This season was a
particularly exciting one. It was our
first year back into the league and I
think we surprised everybody. We
had so many opportunities to go
ahead on Sunday, but wejust didn’t
capitalize on them. We had the tal-
ent to come back and win, but we
didn’t come back. I'm not all that
disappointed about the loss Sunday.
lt’s tough to play all those games and
win them all.”

CMU will play the defending
champion Duquesne Dukes in the
second round playoff tonight at
Lakevue. Duquesne defeated CMU
twice this season, but if they play as
well as they did against Pitt on Sun-
day,‘ the Tartans may well be on their
way to the championship. Roger
Oldaker, head coach ofthe Tartans,
said that Pitt demonstrated a com-

mendable performance on Sunday
and throughout the season. “Pitt has
nothing to be ashamed of. They had
a couple of breaks against them. lfit
wasn’t for those breaks, I think
things would have turned out a little
differently. It was an excellent game
— too bad it was wasted on so few

people."

Oldaker's son is a member of the
Pitt hockey club and in the past has
been on the winning team, but now
the tables are turned. “I had to prove
to Roger that the old man could still
do a few things right," Oldaker said.

Right wing Oldaker assisted in
one of the Pitt goals on Sunday and
totaled 42 points for the Panthers
this season. “We had a great year.
Things like that [losing] happen,"
said Oldaker. “We beat CMU in the
first and third periods decisively. My
father was glad his team won, but he
didn’t want to see us lose either.”

Lineman’s size a plus for Pitt

 
 

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

Spring training for the Pitt foot-
ball team isjust around the bend and
freshman offensive lineman Bob
Sign is a sure indication of the
squad’s determination to improve
on last year's 3-7-1 record. ,

At 6-3, 265 lbs., Sign’s presence
and intensity in the weight room
gives the impression that he would
be just as tough off the football field
as he is on it. However, he leaves his
tough-guy image on the field and in
the weight room. Off the field he is
quiet, friendly and displays the
manners of a Southern gentleman.

“Bobby is total class,” said Pitt

Sign every year, there would be no
problem in college football with aca-
demics or social behavior."

Although Sign is very happy in
Pittsburgh, he almost made a deci-
sion that would have kept him close
to his home in Arlington, Texas. He
orginally planned on going to the
University of Texas, but a final visit
to Pitt changed his mind.

“When you make a decision about
what school to go to, you are sup-
posed to be happy," Sign said. “You
are supposed to have the weight off
your shoulders. I wasjust not happy

Before coming to Pitt, Sign knew
it would not be easy to get a lot of

Panther offensive line, but he
proved his worth when he got his
chance.

According to Sunseri, “He is a very
versatile athlete. I can see him being
a great football player next year and
an All—America someday."

Sign is busy these days preparing
for spring practice, which is slated to
begin March 22. The adjustments
from high school to college football
and academics can often be tough,
but Sign has handled them with
ease.

“In high school, on the offensive
line you use your forearm a lot,” he
explained. “In college you use your
hands more. It is basically the same,
though. The guys in college are
much bigger. The plays and forma-
tions are a lot more complex, too.

lege. You don't have to go to the

Sign’s adjustment to college and
being away from home has been
helped by the closeness of his family.
His parents have not missed a game
this year.

“I don’t know what I would have
done without my family,” he said.
“They have helped me a great deal. If
something is bothering me, I will call

am best friends with him. Wejoke

University of Pittsburgh head
coach Foge Fazio, at a noon
press luncheon yesterday, said
that freshman Dante Wiley, a
Parade All-America at Jeannette
High School a year ago, would
resume his usual position of
quarterback when Pitt spring
practice begins on March 22.

Later in the day, however,
after speaking with Wiley, Fazio
reported that Wiley would
remain on defense, having
played free safety for the second

half of this past season.

Quarterback coach Ron
Turner, who had been with the
Panthers for the past two sea-
sons, resigned to take on a posi-
tion at Southern California.
Although. Pitt lost this coach,
they did‘ acquire a new defensive
line coach. Sal Sunseri, captain
of the 1981 Pittsburgh squad,
assumes this position after
spending last season as a gradu-
ate assistant coach.

DUDE]

Turning to action on the
soccer field, or put more bluntly,
action in the front office, the

Pittsburgh Spirit released mid-
fielder David McNiven on Mon-
day. The 29-year-old McNiven
scored three goals and had one
assist in his 14 games with the
struggling Spirit, who occupy
last place in the Eastern Division
of the MISL with a record of
13-21.

Spirit head coach John
Kowalski explained the reason
for this action in The Pittsburgh
Press yesterday by saying, “We
need to make a couple of
changes, and we need to make
room for players we will be
getting.”

McNiven was in his first year
of a two-year contract, plus an
option season.

‘ Spring, tennis in the Oakland air

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

When head coach George.Dief-
fenbach takes his Panther squad to
Tennessee on Thursday, he will be
armed with one of Pitt’s finest men’s

"tennis teams. Last year’s team fin-

ished the regular season with an
overall record of 8-8, tying for sixth
place with Providence in the Big
East Conference. Pittlost only one
player from that squad.

With five sophomores and one
freshman in their top six, the Pan-
thers not -only have a strong, young
squad this year but also have a good
chance of emerging as a powerful
force in the future.

Sophomore David Johnson, last
year’s team MVP, will anchor the
Pitt attack while assuming the posi-
tion of No. 1 singles and No. 2 dou-
bles player. Johnson was the No. 2
l8-and-under player in Canada and
could develop into one of Pitt’s ﬁn-
est tennis players ever. Last Sep-
tember at the Big East
Championships, Johnson won the
No. 1 singles consolation match.

Johnson's doubles partner is
sophomore transfer Jeff Dadowski
of Coraopolis. Dadowski spent his
freshman year at Bloomsburg State

before coming to Pitt. During last
year’s Big East Championships, he
lost a tough battle, finishing second
in the finals of the No.2 singles con-
solation match.

“Our overall team depth is much
stronger than last year’s team had,”
Dadowski said. “Right now, there is
such a fine line between our top and
bottom players because we’re all so
close in ability."

With the addition of freshman
Greg Campbell to this year’s team,
Pitt gained even more young talent.
Campbell, who hails from Williams-
port, Pa., will occupy the No. 3 sin-
gles and No. 3 doubles spots. As the
I984 PIAA District IV singles cham-
pion with a'No. 23 ranking in the
Middle States I8-and-under singles,
he will definitely add power and con-
sistency to the squad.

“l’ve mainly been concentrating
on my serve and volley game lately,"
he explained. “The coaches have
been working with me in order to
prepare me for my doubles
competition.”

The Panthers will be facing one of
their toughest schedules in recent
years, with the majority of their
matches being against tough Divi-
sion 1 schools. Dieffenbach agreed,
saying that Penn State and West
Virginia should produce the stiffest
competition. Nevertheless, Dief-
fenbach feels that his squad will rise

Pitt tennis team emerges
as dark horse of Big East

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s tennis team will
kick off the 1984-85 season tomor-
row when the squad travels to Ten-
nessee for a four-day stint with six
other schools. The Panthers will face
Tennessee, Knoxville and Maryville
College on Thursday, Tennessee
Chattanooga on Friday, and Ten-
nessee Tech on Saturday. The trip
concludes on Sunday with matches
against Middle Tennessee State and
Tennessee State.

“These are very important
matches,” commented Pitt head
coach George Dieffenbach. “Our
goal right now will be to return to
Pittsburgh with a 3-3 record.”

Dieffenbach said that his squad
should beat Maryville and Tennes-
see State, with the remaining
matches capable of “going either
way.”

The toughest competition will
undoubtedly be the twin Tennessees
of Knoxville and Chatanooga.
Knoxville has a history of turning
out top quality players — this year’s
team ranked in the nations’ Top 10.
Chatanooga currently boasts Davis

Match
Preview

Cup player Orlando Laurenco of
Zimbabwe. Laurenco is ranked 98th
in the country in singles
competition.

The Panthers will rely heavily on
their youth and strong team depth to
carry them through the long week-
end schedule.

“We’re very optimistic at this
point,” stated freshman Greg Camp-
bell. “Our attitude and team spirit
are very high  there are no inner-
team rivalries.”

Pitt’s schedule at the Division I
level involves six singles and three
doubles matches per meet. Dieffen-
bach feels confident with his t sin-
gles players, but added, Our
doubles will be the deciding factor in

terms of the success we have this
season.”

Although the weather has just
begun to show signs of spring, the
Pitt squad has been practicing
indoors up until this recent change.

“We’ve been practicing outside
this past week, and it’s really helped
us a lot,” said sophomore Jeff
Dadowski. “I'm expecting both the
team and myself to play well.”

Fellow sophomore Rich Monte-
leone sees the trip to Tennessee as a
key stage in this young season with
goals of a 3-3 start to shoot for.

“Our Tennessee matches are vital
in preparing us for the remainder of
the season because the competition
will be such a challenge,” he
explained.

Whatever the case, Dieffenbach’s
squad will be entering its longest sea-
son ever (22 matches). He said that a
12-10 record would make him “the
happiest coach at the University of
Pittsburgh.” The stop-over in Ten-
nessee will be the starting point
toward reaching this goal.
