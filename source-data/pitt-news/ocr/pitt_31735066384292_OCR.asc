The departments of black studies
and anthropology will be housed in
the new.Forbes Quadrangle Comp-
lex, located behind Hillman Lib-
rary, beginning Feb. 8.

Black studies currently is housed
at 3804 Forbes Ave., while the
Anthropology Department occupies
a building at 234 Atwood St.

In subsequent moves, at dates yet
to be determined, the Mervis Hall
offices of the history, geography,
sociology and political science
departments will be relocated to the
Forbes Complex. The Graduate
Schools of Business and Education.

The economics
department will be the only social
science department to remain in
Mervis Hall when the move is
completed.

Baylson, who also has served on

the Student Government Alloca-

ism towards his one-year tenure as
SGB president.

Baylson said his ﬁrst duties
would include strengthening the
SGB standing committees and
increasing student involvement in
student government.

“We have to get more students
involved and make them feel we’re
representing them,” he said.

During his campaign, Baylson
stressed academic issues like the
Undergraduate Academic Review
and course description handbooks,
and also called for new campus
programming that would offer
entertainment not provided else-
where in Pittsburgh.

Hesidence, an incumbent, also
expressed optimism towards his
second consecutive year on the
board. “I’m looking forward to
another year, he said.

muter Committee will be using a
computer to place Pitt commuters
in various carpools, according to
project head Frank Kunkel.

The computer, which will be fed
names and residences of com-
muters, will sort out the informa-
tion and assign car pools based on
geographic locations of students
who elect to sign up for the
program.

“If it works properly, commuters

co-chairman Gloria Dorn. “The
program will cut the time and cost
of commuting to Pitt.”

“We’ll probably have the pro-
gram for the computer done by the
end of the week,” Kunkel said.

The committee hopes to have the
car pools operating by the ﬁrst
week of next month.

Persons involved in the project
deny any intention of competing

“It’s more to take cars off the
road than people off the buses,”
Dorn said. “The car pools will be
able to serve commuters who
cannot easily be" served by PAT.”

The idea of organized car pools

advanced in December 1976 when
PAT drivers struck, halting city bus
service. The Student Government
Board set up a booth in Schenley
Hall and volunteers organized
emergency car pools by hand.

"72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

1119 New Board

The Student Government Board elections, both extended and
abbreviated by the weather, are now over. The votes have been
counted and the winners will be inaugurated Jan. 30.

Josh Baylson, Diane Behers, Stan Galanski, Dave Hesidence,
Jan Medoff, Bernie Popko and Sharon Starzynski face a year full

of opportunities and challenges.

So—called “old business,”

including progress of the Undergraduate Academic Review and
faculty English competency requirements, should be taken care of

as soon as possible.

But this is a new board and a new year, and new business, new

initiatives should be the board’s priority.

Without neglecting

projects already in the works, SGB should turn itsattention to
long—neglected areas, such as commuter concerns, year—round
lobbying in Harrisburg and University relations with the Oakland

community.

The student assembly, though a laudable project in principle, has

not worked well in the past year.

We suggest that measures be

taken either to reform and revitalize the assembly or abolish it

altogether.

Past boards have made grand and sweeping promises that have
been difficult to fulfill. While we hope that the board realizes the
limits of what a student government can actually accomplish, we

equally hope it works together for the programs it promised.

Abortion as Anti-Feminism 

By MARY WINTER

I would like to address the issue
of abortion from the viewpoint of a
pro-life feminist—a feminist in the
true sense of the wordzone who
wants what is best for women.
What is best for women cannot be
abortion. After centuries of being
treated as objects, women have
been presented the ﬁnal mechan-
ical insult as a constitutional right.
The strange compulsion for abor-
tion is, in reality, the ultimate
exploitation of women by immature
men; technocrats, generally, im-
bued with a myopic sense of social
awareness and unable to interpret
or control their own sexuality. (1
do_n’t want what I write here
considered a blanket condemnation
of men. Some of my favorite
people are males.)

It was no surprise Playboy
Foundation money’ joined with
Rockefeller Foundation money to
promote the concept of permissive
abortion and helped to bring about
the Supreme Court’s tragic abor-
tion decision. The rich man's
solution has become the puerile
male’s solution, and the last
vestige of responsibility and .
commitment has disappeared.

Responsibility and Mutuality  

By GARY GOVERT

“At the heart of the contro-

versy... are those recurring preg-

nancies that pose no danger
whatsoever to the life or health of
the mother but are, nevertheless,
unwanted for any one or more of a
variety of reasons—convenience,
family planning, economics. . .etc. ’ ’

The statement above is excerpt-
ed from Justice Byron R. White’s
dissenting opinion to the 1973
Supreme Court decision that, in

effect, legalized ﬁrst trimester

abortions for any woman who
wants one (and can pay for it). I
quote Justice White because these
so-called “abortions for the sake of
convenience” are to be -the focus of
this commentary.
certain other categories—those in
which the mother’s life is endan-
gered and cases of rape and incest,
for instance—are an entirely
different matter, and I cannot deal
with them here.

Abortion.' The word itself is
enough to kindle a ﬁre in most
people. Pro-lifers and pro-choicers
both are only too willing to take
offense when they encounter a
viewpoint in opposition to their
own. In fact, it might be said the
art of polemics has reached new
low_s in the politics of abortion.

Logicians and legislators have
done little to help the situation. No
one, as far as I can tell, has _yet
been able to adequately demon-
strate whether a fetus is a “human
being.” Congress has muddled its
way through the abortion question
to such an extent that it now
appears the Government approves
of convenience, abortions for the
already convenience-laden rich,
but not for the overburdened poor.

Nevertheless, I think some sense
can be made of this important and
divisive issue. If our humanity
requires something more from us
than responsibility-free individual-
ism, then abortions for the sake of
convenience are morally indefen-
sible.

Abortions obtained and per-
formed for the sake of convenience
are very much wrapped up in what
has been called “a woman’s right
to choose.” A euphemism like that
is difficult to quarrel with. heavy as
it is with intimations of liberty and

p equality for all, but I think it points

Abortions in .

to ‘an error in pro-abortionist
philosophy.

Straight off, a “right” is claimed.
Exactly what a “right” might be,
in a universal and lasting sense, I
am not quite suﬁ. I am fairly
certain, however, the currently
popular American cultural deﬁni-
tion is incorrect.

Rights, although they serve a
necessary and legitimate function
in society, oftencut people off from
one another. They are barriers
against the infringement of others
upon our political, financial,
physical, emotional—and often
relational—autonomy. Our con-
ception of rights has, in fact, done
much to foster a deeply ingrained
cultural individualism, a sort of
“over-againstness” in our rela-
tionships with other people. The
social and spiritual viability of this
individualism is debatable, I
suppose, although I am quite
convinced it is radically wrong-
headed. But in any case, I think
the inﬂuence of this individualism
is rather evident when it comes to
claiming a woman’s right to choose
an abortion without interference
from anyone else,. including her
husband.

A discussion of human rights
would be glaringly incomplete
without an attendant consideration
of human responsibilities, and it is
here that pro-choicers—and often
pro-lifers as well—have com-
pletely dropped the ball.

In his book, “I Pledge You My
Troth,” Dr. John Olthius, a
Canadian theologian, wrote, “Will-
ingness to engage in physical
intercourse includes the mutual
promise...to bear the responsibility
of the act.” Although at ﬁrst glance
there might be a tendency to
dismiss this statement as another
example of moralistic anti-abor-
tionist dogmatism, I do not think
that would be wise. Instead, I think
Olthius has very succinctly pointed
out the essence of human sexual
dignity and freedom.

There are at least two key words
in Olthius’s maxim, one of which,
of course, is “responsibility.”
Anti-abortionists sometimes say—
rather insensitively, I think—the
right to choose an abortion is
negated by the right to avoid
getting into the situation in the ﬁrst
place. It would be much better,
and much more accurate, to say the

right to full human sexual dignity
entails the responsibility to accept
full human sexuality. In other
words, if we are unwilling to accept
the fullness of our sexuality-which
includes the possibility of procrea-
tion—then we have no right to claim
the fullness of human sexual
dignity. Abortions for the sake of
convenience, therefore, are a denial
of one’s own humanity.

The other key word, all too often
ignored by men and women alike,
is “mutua .” The union of egg with
sperm is an event for which a man
and a woman are always mutually
responsible. Mutuality—-shared,
other-directed 'love——is so impor-
tant to human sexual dignity that,
without it, the’ act.of intercourse
itself becomes an act of sexual
exploitation. The absence of
mutuality reduces the man or
woman or both to the‘ status of
sexual objects

An emphasis on mutuality
precludes a woman’s right to
individualistic, autonomous deci-
sions to abort potential children.
But such an emphasis also points to
a dismal chapter in the history of
maleness. Men, who have
consistently failed to recognize and
accept responsibility for their own
sexuality, have compromised their
humanity every bit as much as
women who value convenience and
“rights” above true dignity and\
mutuality.

So it is clear, at least. to me, that
abortions for the sake of conven-
ience are wrong. Claims to sexual -
humanity and dignity are empty
without prior acceptance of sexual
responsibility and mutuality.
When responsibility and mutuality
are abandoned, men and women
share the blame equally.

- I realize I have avoided the
question of how to help the poor
and the emotionally distraught with
family planning, but I am convin-
ced abortion is not the answer. It is
approaching the question back-
wards and from the perspective of a
culture that doesn’t want to make
the sacriﬁces involved in finding a
real solution. I suspect—and this
should be no surprise—the answer
will be found in societal acceptance
of economic and political responsi-
bility and mutuality, rather than in
the elimination of potential pro-
hlem-solvers.

Any volunteer at any pro-life
pregnancy service hears, over and
over again, women explaining that
their boyfriends are willing to pay
for an abortion, but will desert them
if they decide to bear the child.
These irresponsible males are
simply following the lead of the
champion of all male chauvinist
pigs, Hugh Hefner, whose Playboy
philosophy exploits women sexual-
ly, psychologically and ﬁnancially,
while helping the.women’s libera-
tion movement in its ﬁght for a
woman’s “right to control her own
body.” It is incredible pro-abortion
feminists can’t see through this
kind of “help.” Susan B. Anthony
must be turning over in her grave.

I am concerned the feminist cause
is being betrayed by the men and
women pushing for public ac-
ceptance and funding of the killing
of pre-born humans. On this issue,
radical feminists have completely
identiﬁed with the male aggressor;
they spout a straight machismo
ideology. It is a classic case of the
oppressed becoming the oppressors
as they demand the power of life
and death overvtheir offspring and
insist upon the right to take their
children’s lives to preserve their
own lifestyles. They claim to ﬁght
for rights for all women, and yet

would deny the fundamental right-

to life to the tiny women who are not
yet born.

You would think it would be
obvious to pro-abortion feminists
that they have played right into the
hands of male technocrats, irres-
ponsible boyfriends and the popu-

he might be expected to accept
some responsibility. too.

3. “Any problem" pregnancy
should be terminated early by a
qualiﬁed doctor employing the best
technological techniques.” Yet the
feminist movement has persistent-
ly protested impersonal profes-
sional technologies that efﬁciently
ignore not only emotions, but the
real roots of complex human
problems. Males have always
searched, destroyed, cut, burned
and aggressively attacked anything
in the way,. without regard to
context, consequences and'natural
interrrelationships. Women have
been committed to creative nonvio-
lent alternatives that seek more
lasting solutions.

4. ‘Males have no right to speak
or legislate on the abortion issue,
(unless they agree with us, of
course).” This argument is used
to browbeat men, but it is contrary
to other feminist demands. Femin-
ists justly insist upon equal
male-female cooperation, decision-
making and mutual responsibility in
all areas of social life.Only with
abortion does community concern
become disallowed. Men are
angrily disqualiﬁed, although over
half the aborted babies are male,
all pre-born babies are father ‘

physically linked to the human
species as a whole.

On January 22, 1973—five years ago yesterday-the United
States Supreme Court ruled that state laws restricting a
woman’s right to abortion during the first trimester of her
pregnancy were unconstitutional.

The Pitt News today presents four differing perspectives 6:0,‘

this important issue.

Mary Winter is Vice-President of People Concerned for the
Unborn Child and a member of Feminists for Life. John Burkoff
is a professor of law at Pitt. His column consists of excerpts
from testimony he gave before a Pennyslvania Senate
committee considering H.B. 71, a joint resolution calling for a
Consitutional Convention to draft a “right to life” amendment.
Maggie McKay and Gary Govert are Pitt News staff writers.

women continue to mouth slogans
that are male-oriented and a sellout
of real feminist values. For
instance:

1. “The fetus isn’t human and
has no right to life.” But the
feminist movement insists men
cease their age-old habit of
dehumanizing women, blacks,
Jews, Indians and -any other
‘helpless or different instances of
human life. To deny the fact of the
humanity of the pre-born child is to
deny scientiﬁc evidence and is a
failure of imagination and em-
pathy. Out of sight, out of mind,
may do for a bombardier’s
conscience, but not for a feminist
movement dedicated to ending
unilateral suppression of life.

2. “A woman has the right to
control her own body.” How
valiantly the feminist movement
has struggled against the male
obsession to control. Many men are
only too happy to separate female
“reproductive systems” from the

self and view female bodies as a
form of property. To many males,
full feminine sexuality, including
childbearing ability, is a threat.

Better to encourage women to look
at their own bodies as objects that
they can manipulate at will and keep
under control—-privately, efﬁcient-
ly with no messy demand. Better to
have a woman view the pre-born
child as a “piece” of her own body
rather than as a separate human
being temporarily residing within
her. After all, if she assumed
responsibility for this new parson,

demand society develop a true ,

concern for our physical and
psychological equilibrium and offer
us something more humane than
abortion for our socio-economic
problems.

We reject the increasing ten-

dency to view pregnancy as
.. .\

disease to be eradicated,
abnormality, a society-‘threatening
condition. We are outraged at the
view held by population control
advocates that women are wombs
to be deactivated, rather than
human beings with lives to be
fulﬁlled.
Pro-life women are committed to
working to provide positive, life-
giving, life-enhancing answers for
women faced with problem preg-
nancies, rather than the physically
and emotionally‘ traumatizing e
pedient of abortion. A
feminist approach must deny’
violence a legitimate place in our
society by rejecting the ﬁrst
violence—abortion. The women of
this society must say to puerile men
that the game is over. They can no
longer exploit our bodies either in
the centerfolds or on their abortion
bills. If Bella Abzug, Gloria
Steinem, Betty B-Friedan and their
friends in the radical feminist
movement want to play along with
Playboy, that is their problem. But
they ought to stop imposing Hugh

Hefner's morality on the rest of 11%!
I .

and they ought to stop calling
“liberation." The Playboy philo-
sophy representsiwomen's libera-
tion like Adolph Hitler represented
B’nai B’rith.

By JOHN BURKOFF

I am not here to speak on the issue
of abortion. ‘Rather, I have tailored
my remarks to respond to the
particular procedural device pro-
posed in House Bill 71'—an
application to Congress for a call for
a constitutional convention. I
oppose passage of H.B. 71 on
grounds of constitutional history,
policy and risk. The issue of what I
call “constitutional risk” in part-
icular is a very real one, and I would
like to deal with it in three different
ways: (1) the risk arising from the

ambiguous and uncertain state of
constitutional law; (2) the risk
involved in consideration of “spec-
ia ’_’ consitutional amendments, and
(3) the risk presented by the
ambiguity of the H.B. 71 proposed
constitutional text.

First, the legal risk. My
reference here is to the many, many
jurisprudential loose ends associat-
ed with construction and interpreta-
tion of Article V of the Constitution.
I assume you have heard and read a
great deal on this subject in the past
few months. I venture to say the
sheer diversity and contrariety of

legal opinion should tell you
something-that there are no
ultimate legal conclusions reliably
to be drawn on the various issues
posed. Let me highlight a couple of
the important points here.

Most important for present
purposes, the constitutional history
is ambiguous—to say the least-on
the question whether or not a
limited Consitutional Convention,-
that is, a Convention limited to
passage of a particular Amend-
ment, can (1) be called by Congress,
and/or (2) be held. These -are,
notably, two separate questions.

at Abortion: A Private Decision

By MAGGIE McKAY

Abortion--saying the word is akin
to ringing a bell for the start of a
prize ﬁght. Opponents rush out of
all corners of the ring, punching
wildly and knocking each other
senseless. No referee in his right
mind would ‘try to decide the
outcome of the bout. There is no
winner in the abortion brouhaha.

Abortion is an emotional issue
with a plethora of religious, moral
and legal quesitons. Opponents of
abortion often charge that men and
women today are abdicating their
responsibilities toward the family,
are opting for abortion of “conven-
ience.” Pro-abortion or “pro-
choice” advocates often argue that
the abortion decision is one that
involves more than mere conven-
ience for the woman because her

"future will bear the brunt of

pregnancy, birth and child-rearing.
It’s hard to straddle the middle
line and take a neutral stance on
abortion. After struggling to juggle
my Catholicism and my belief
abortion was a private issue to be
decided on a case by case basis, I

‘found myself on the “pro-choice”

side of the abortion fence.

The major catalyst for my
decision was the struggle this
summer and fall over" the Labor-
HEW appropriations bill. Contain-
ed within this bill was the Hyde
amendment, authored by obscure
Congressman Henry J . Hyde,
which sought to stop Federal
funding of abortions. The attempt
to restrict the abortion rights of the
poor by withdrawing state funds
from clinics for Medicaid abortions
angers and offends me. It offends

. me to see the state violate the

doctrine of separation of church and
state by using its secular power to
enforce the theology of the
Christian churches. —

The implicit double standard of

the Medicaid abortion controversy
also offends me. As the laws are
actually administered, middle-class
private patients may receive
abortions without state interfer-
ence, while the state is attempting
to shut down birth control clinics
providing such services to the poor.
Jimmy Carter expressed this double
standard which favors the middle-
and upper-classes this summer
when he made a speech on the
issue, and said “Life is unfair.”

It certainly is unfair that a
middle-class woman has the right to
obtain certain medical treatment
that is denied to poorer women. It’s
unfair, Mr. Carter, but does that
mean women should just shut up
and put up? Denial of equal
protection under the law is a serious
matter.

In 1973, in Roe v. Wade, the
Supreme Court ruled that until the
end of the first trimester, “the
attending physician, in consultation
with his patient, is free to
determine, without regulation by
the state, that in his medical
judgment the patient’s pregnancy
should be terminated. If that
decision is reached, the judgment
may be effectuated by an abortion
free of interference by the state.”

Aside from the legal question of
equal protection under the 14th
Amendment, there is more to the
abortion issue. The Supreme
Court’s ruling in Roe v. Wade
conﬁrmed my opinion that abortion
is a private matter. It is a decision to
be made by a woman in conjuction
with her doctor and the man
involved also, be he husband or
lover. Religious or moral views also
necessarily enter "into the decision
of whether to have an abortion.

The decision is a painful one to
make, but it is a private decision and
no legal restrictions should be
placed upon it.

One would hope that those who
object to their tax monies being
spent to maintain safe standards for
abortions and adequate facilities
will realize that clandestine abort-
ion factories will continue to
operate. Women will continue to
seek abortion, and consequently
risk dying from infections and inept
surgical techniques. Denying funds
for Medicaid abortions will not stop
the problems, only aggravate them.

01 course, there should be
alternatives to abortion. Lower
class women, teenagers and college
students should be educated about
birth control methods. But it’s a
fact that educative programs are
woefully few and far between, and
the availability of birth control
devices is limited to a small number
of American women. Until
programs and clinics that deal with
pregnancy and its psychological and
physical problems are properly
staffed and funded, there can be no
progress in the abortion morass.

As the Supreme Court stated in
Roe v. Wade, “Maternity, or
additional offspring, may force
upon the woman a distressful life
and future. Psychological harm
may be imminent. Mental and
physical health may be taxed by
child care. There is also the distress
for all concerned and associated
with the unwanted child, and there
is the problem of bringing a child
into a family already unable,
psychologically and otherwise, to
care for.it.”

Until we can adequately counsel a
pregnant woman, until we can
really ease the difficulties of
pregnant women, trying to staunch
the growing abortion rate would be
futile. The right of a woman to
decide whether to bear and beget a
child is fundamental, and it
necessarily includes her right to
decide whether to terminate
pregnancy.

Senate TestimonyOn Constitutional Convention

The Article V language referring to
the call for a “Convention for
proposing Amendments” suggests,
as the distinguished constitutional
historian, Charles Black Jr., of Yale
Law School, concluded, that the
framers envisioned “a convention
for proposing such amendments as
to that convention seem suitable for
being proposed.” To restate the
point—it is not in the least clear that
Congress is constitutionally em-
powered to call a Constitutional
Convention that does not have the
wholesale freedom to deliberate

upon and to draft whatever’

proposed amendments it cares to
make. As United States Senator
William Proxmire stated in Senate
discussion of this point in 1967:
“The constitutional language is
clear that the convention can
propose any number of amend-
ments; that this is. the purpose
of...Article V.”

There is a grave risk here. Legal
issues notwithstanding—whether
there can be a limited Convention-
the pure political fact of life
remains: If such 8. Convention is
called and convenes, there is no way
to exert any rein on it; it can do
whatever it wants! The real
question is what can the Congress
or the courts or the states do about
the Convention after the fact?

What kind of changes might
come? Name your poison. All you
need is a majority of delegates who
are upset about the Supreme
Court’s reapportionment decisions,
for example, or affirmative action,
or a majority of delegates who want
to constitutionalize a requisite
afﬁrmative action, or to modify the
Fourth Amendment, or ban hand-
guns, or this or that or anything!

Add to this not so hypothetical
scenario the type of deeply, morally
committed individuals likely to
constitute a substantial element-
perhaps ,a majority—-of such a
national anti-abortion Convention,
and who knows what other issues of
current moral and emotional
moment might strike their ‘collective
fancy.

The point is there is a substantial
risk even if it were possible as a
legal matter for Congress to call a
limited convention, it is far from
clear that such a convention can
constitutionally be limited in
practice so as to preclude it from
being, in the constitutional langu-
age——“a Convention for proposing
Amendments. ’ ’

A second area of risk posed by
H.B. 71 is the precedent of
encouraging “special”
amendments to the Constitution.
The United States Constitution has
a very special position in the
judicial and popular construction of
American law. It is commonly
viewed by the legal community as
the repository not only of speciﬁc
textual requirements as the rights
and duties, but as embodying more
rareﬁed jurisprudential principles
of overriding importance. That is
why the Constitutional language is
couched in the general, hortatory
language of, for .example, “due
process” or “equal protection.”
That is why the Constitutional
preface refers to a document
“ordain(ed)” by the people not
merely “enacted” as an ordinary
statute. To the extent it is
proposed we treat the Constitution
like an ordinary legislative enact-
ment, in the allowance of special
interest type, speciﬁc‘ amendments
-proposed by religious or partisan

political groups, the sanctity of the -

Constitutional symbolism is

destroyed.

Moreover, even if it were
clear——as it is not—a majority of
the American people favored such
a change in the Constitutional text,

the United States Constitution has
a role that transcends that of
reﬂecting the will of evanescent
majorities of the populace. It is,
among other things, a repository of
minority rights. It serves to protect
those individuals and those groups
of individuals who are not in so
numerous or so powerful a position
that they can otherwise protect
themselves adequately in our
political system.

In the case of H.B. 71, in
particular, to the extent we ratify
the imposition of a particular
religious morality upon those
individuals who seek to avail
themselves of abortion services, we
are seeking to instill and coerce a
moral conformity that is incon-
sistent with the basic American
commitment to individual freedoms
as guaranteed, particularly by the
Bill of Rights.

A third danger is associated. with
the particulat text of H.B. 71. It is
important to show that H.B. 71
mandates the Constitutional Con-
vention must provide that life
begins for legal purposes at “the
moment of fertilization.” Aside
from the patent incongruity of a
legal document crafted to dictate a
final answer to the age-old

religious question of when life.

begins, this passage in H.B. 71 will
clearly have significant legal
impact beyond that purportedly
intended. For example, the use of
some contraceptive methods, most
particularly the use of IUDs, would

' most certainly be rendered uncon-

stitutional—and, note, subject to
criminalization. Implantation,
which IUDs are designed to
prevent, occurs subsequent to the
act of “fertilization,” at least as I
construe that ambiguous term.
The point to bear in mind is
constitutional language often holds
sway in contexts totally unantici-
pated by its draftsmen. The best
example of this point is the scope of
modem application of the 14th
Amendment “equal protection”
phraseology.

’ -In this vein, you should take

careful note that the phrase “right
to life” in H.B. 71—language that
is presently found nowhere in the
Constitution-—might well be taken
to have a far broader meaning than
you or its draftsmen apparently
intend. For example, I ﬁnd it
rather easy to construe that phrase
as guaranteeing all Americans
rights that have explicitly not been
found by the present Supreme
Court majority to be commanded
by the current constitutional text,
e.g., a right to decent housing, a
right to welfare, a right to adequate
and sufﬁcient medical care, etc.
Certainly I intend. to make this
argument to appellate courts in the
unlikely event that a “right to life”
amendment succeeds.

In short, I am afraid of—and
uncertain about—the consequen-
ces of the procedures recom-
mended to the Pennsylvania
Assembly to effect a national

anti-abortion policy. I am afraid of .

what they might mean beyond the
conﬁnes of the purported intent to
limit the proposed Convention’s
charge to the anti-abortion issue. I
am afraid of the national turmoil

the debate over these legal
questions will create when it
becomes clear that such a

convention, if called by Congress,

has at least the potential power-— '

and, perhaps, even the constitu-
tional obligation—to reconsider
and redraft for proposal vast
portions of the Constitution.

I would solicit you to be very,
very careful about the political, the
moral, and the legal Pandora’s Box
you are being asked to open. I

strongly urge you to reject H.B. 71.

Gene Wilder and Carol Kane strike a dramatic pose in this scene from "The

Panthers, sporting a new and

maturing coaching strategy and a
new-found conﬁdence spawned by a
pair of Field House wins, become
Cincinnati coach Gale Catlett’s
guests at Riverfront Coliseum
tonight (8 p.m. WTAE radio).

Pitt’s main obstacle, now that the
Panthers (8-5) no longer face their
worst enemy in the mirror before
each game, will be the revenge-
fueled ﬁres with which Catlett, a

Grapplers Pinned Beneath Engineers’ bble

By CHIP HUBBARD

Winning efforts on the parts of
Mike Bond, Ed Bredniak, Tom
Jones and Jim Gordon were not
enough Saturday night, as the
Panther wrestlers went down to
defeat at the hands of a powerful
Lehigh team, 21-12.

“The wrestling from both teams
was excellent,” said Pitt coach
Dave Adams. “There were some
really good and exciting matches. . .I

‘:7 don’t think we have anything to

5..

hang our heads about.”

A crowd of over 1,000 watched as
the Panther matmen put on one of
the most exciting wrestling meets at
the Field House this year.

Lehigh was leading 9-0 before the
Panthers notched their ﬁrst win, as
Mike Bond defeated Lehigh’s Greg
Cunningham in the 142-pound
class.

The Panthers went on to win the
150-pound with Ed Bredniak
beating Joe Hockman. Freshman
Tom Jones put on a good
performance to tie the meet at 9-9
by downing Jeff Allegar. The last

‘win by the Panthers was Jim
Gordon’s victory over Bill Amelio.

"We got a big lift from Jimmy
Gordon tonight,’ ’ said Adams. ‘ ‘He
did an excellent job. Amelio beat
him (Gordon) at the Penn State
Tournament.”

surely will attempt to burn his
visitors. The Bearcats are 9-6 after
Saturday afternoon’s loss to
Memphis State here, a defeat that
was Cincinnati’s second in its past
72 home games.

Pitt’s home record is not so
sparkling, but, after the Panthers’
65-64 win against Cincinnati at the
Field House last season, Catlett told
reporters his team would not be
back.

Pitt was a 6-21 team last year, so,
Catlett believed, it took more than
Pitt’s good showing and his team’s
poor performance to allow Larry
Harris’s last-second bomb to win

Senior George O’Korn dropped
the 177 class to Colin Kilrain in a
close match in which O’Korn
gained a burst of strength in the last
minute.

“O’Korn lost, but he came back
ﬁring, and I was pleased to see
that,” remarked Adams. “That’s
an excellent wrestler they have
(Kilrain). He was their number-
one recruit.”

In the 190-pounds, the only pin of
the night was scored by the
Engineers’ Art Luberman. He
pinned the still-injured freshman
Mike Palko with 1:13 left in the
second period.

It was left up to Mark
Stepanovich to pull it out for the
Panthers with a pin in the
heavyweight, but the senior, in his
second match of the year lost in the
last few minutes of the third period
to Mike Brown.

“Mark has not had enough mat
time yet to be able to be in top
shape; the big thing is condition-
ing,” Adams commented.

The grapplers also dropped the
ﬁrst three matches: the 118, the 126,
and the 134. Rande Stottlemyer,
who did not wrestle last night
because of the ﬂu was replaced by
Jackie Kline, who, according to
Adams, made a ﬁne performance.

“We didn’t have Rande in there,

By ANGELA VAVITHES

Pitt’s men’s swimming team
added two victories to its growing
total (now four) during the past
week, slaughtering Kent State, 74
to 38, Thursday and beating Penn
‘State by the same score Saturday.

‘ In both meets, many swimmers
tried different strokes and distances
in an effort to develop more
versatility.

Against Penn State, the Panthers
shut out the Nittany Lions in four
events. The ﬁrst shutout was in the
200-yard freestyle, in which Mickey
Termin, Neal Wallace and Mike
Reinhard ﬁnished ﬁrst, second and
third, respectively.

In the 50-yard freestyle, Panthers
Tom McGinley, Dave Civis and
Orlando Catinchi ﬁnished one, two,
three. It happened again in the
500-yard freestyle when Dale
Pﬂaumer, Stuart Swanson and Bob
Greenwald led the way for Pitt.

In the 200-yard breastroke, Mike
Connors, Bob Clemmer and Catin-
chi all ﬁnished ahead of last year’s
Eastern Champion.

During the 13-event meet, Penn
State only managed to win two
events--the 200-yard butterﬂy and
the 200-yard individual medley.

The men’s track meet, post-
fponed from Friday night, will be run
today at the Field House. West
Virginia University will face Pitt in
the Panthers’ home opener, with
jumping events beginning at 5 p.m.
and running events at 6 p.m.

I TRACK RESCHEDULED

Against Kent State, Mark
Schuman bettered Civis’s record in
the 50-yard freestyle with a time of
21.42, and Pat Greenwell qualiﬁed
for nationals in the three-meter
diving with a total of 312 points (the
required number for qualifying is
310).

The Panthers are all pleased with

 

   

the game. Catlett wouldn’t say it,
but in a post-game press confer-
ence, he implied his belief that the
referees were like Cincinnati’s Joe
Morgan in that they batted about
.300.

Catlett’s recent weeks have not
been centered around Pitt’s visit,
however. The Bearcats, playing in
the tough Metro-Seven Conference,
have played eight straight confer-
ence games. They were the
pre-season Metro-Seven favorite;
today, they’re in the middle of the
league’s standings.

The Bearcats are led by a pair of
strongmen. Johnstown’s Pat

but Jackie did a nice job; he was

just out-forced as a 134-pounder.
He is only 126, and that was too
much weight right there for him.

We missed Rande in there, and we
missed Bailey but you can’t go on‘
what could have been. You have to

go on what you did.”

PSU, KSU

the way the season is developing.
Coach Dick Bradshaw even predict-
ed, “the men’s swimming team will
be the only undefeated team at Pitt
this year.”

Pitt faces a top team Saturday
when they swim against Maryland,
the East’s 10th-ranked team.

average near 18 and is third in the
nation in ﬁeld goal percentage

defense this season, likely will stay
away from a man-to-man until
(and if) I-Iarris forces the Bearcats
out of a zone.
