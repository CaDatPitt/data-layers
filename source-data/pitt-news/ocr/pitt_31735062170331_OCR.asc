Political Discussion Heated

by BOB OBENREDER

Heated discussion and rhetoric
highlighted “The ’72 Elections,”
a panel discussion held last
Thursday in Langley Hall. Rep-
resentatives from the Democrat-
ic, Republican, and Socialist par-
ties" lauded their candidates and
party policies in a.two-hour ses-
sion where outbursts from both
the speakers and audience were
frequent.

The Democrats were represent-
ed by... Mike Stinson, a Vietnam
veteran and student at Robert
Morris College. William Johns-
ton, a Pitt student and member of
the College Republicans, repre-

_ sented the Republican party, and
Stephanie Coontz, a Woodrow Wil-
5 son Fellow from Berkeley and
former co-ordinator for the Na-
tional Peace Coalition, spoke for
the Socialist Workers Party. The
Communist Party was contacted,

but did not send a speaker.

Each person briefly outlined
his parties’ platforms in a 10
minute address. Stinson opened
his address declaring Nixon’s
good showing.in the polls a result
of the majority of Republican pub-
lishers across the nation. The re-
mainder of his talk focused on In-
do-China war. He held Nixon re-
sponsible for all the victims of
the war since Nixon took office in
1968.

Stinson declared there was no
such thing as an honorable war,
that Nixon’s withdrawal policies
were a failure due to the bombing
escalation and increase of troops
elesewhere in Indo—China, and
that the Saigon regime was mere-
ly a puppet of the United States.
“This war in Vietnam is a politi-
cal war,” Stinson claimed.

The Republican speaker, Wil-
liam Johnston, addressed the as-
sembly in a much lower key-. ‘He

iWilliams Pushes Grass Roots Campaign
To Become First Black State Treasurer

by KARL BALDYS
Glenn E. Williams, Jr. is the
Republican candidate for State‘
Treasurer. He came to Pittsburgh

Saturday to shake some bands,

and, hopefully, win some votes.
“This is what I call ‘Grass Roots
Contact,”’ he said.

Williams feels that the offices
of Treasurer, along with the of-
fice of Auditor General, are neg-
lected by the voters and thus left
for the politicians to manipulate.
He said, “These are two jobs that
I call ‘Garbage Can Jobs’ because
they are unglamorous and yet

‘ Coontz Seeks Support L
For SWP Candidates

“A vote for us is much more

, significant than a vote for either
the Democratic or Republican
parties; a vote for them is a vote-
against yourself, a counter pro-
ductive vote,” said Stephanie

Coontz, touring speaker for the
Socialist Workers Party.

the American people from the

Some of the duties of the State
Treasurer include: (1) depositor
of all moneys of the Common-
wealth; (2) examiner of requisi-
tions for disbursements; (3) stat-
utory custodian of funds, such as
Unemployment Compensation;
and (4) chairman of the Board of
Finance and Revenue.

Attacking the present State.
Treasurer, Grace Sloan, Williams

said, “S_he’s no more than a rub- A

She is now 73 years old and, ac-

persuaded her to stay because he
doesn’t like the State Democratic

Chairman who would have run for ‘I

the office if she hadn’t.”'He add-
ed, “What will happen is, she will
try to get elected and, if elected,
resign, allowing the Governor to
appoint his own Treasurer.”

Williams accused the Shapp ad-
ministration of circumventing the
Treasurer’s office. He pointed out

Physical Plant Blasted

‘ by JOAN EASTBOURN’

Repeated blasts at the Office of
the Physical Plant of the Univer-
sity reflected Student Govern-
ment Board President Tom Bail-
ey’s attitude at the Board’s week-
ly meeting.

Initially, he cited the problem
of the intramural playing’ field
lights as ‘being Physical Plant’s
fault. The lights have been out

‘since the new parking lot was put

in next to Trees Hall due to the
severance of the cable to the field
during the lot’s construction. Di-
rector of IM Athletics Leo Bemis
had assured SG that repairs
would be completed" by Sept. 19,
but the problem “is no longer in
his hands,”‘according to Bailey.

A. The question being asked is who
will fund the repair, and as yet,

wer.

A second stab at the Physical
Plant came when Board member
Terry Sadler expressed concern,
asking why the Trees Hall park-
ing‘ lot, which is open to students

_throughout the week, is reserved

parking only, on weekends.
“Many students have come in for
games on Saturdays and depend
on parking there, but find they’re
not allowed in,” he said.

Bailey again lit into Physical
Plant, tagging thatoffice as being
at fault. “I"can’t believe all the
things they’re screwing up,” he
added.

In discussing the Activities
Fair's request for extra funds,
the Board conceeded that the
event "‘didn’t come off” as it
should have. “It was too faraway

L Although Women’ s Studi/e_s
courses have been offered through

the College of Arts and Sciences '

since 1969, it was only last Octo-
ber that the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences decided to create an in-
terdisciplinary program to formu-
late, focus and coordinate a curri-
culum for Women's Studies. Since
then, three new faculty members,
who have been appointed to the
English, History and Psychology
departments, will devote part of

their time directly to Women’s‘

Studies.
Mary Briscoe, associate profes-

. sor of English and coordinator of

the program; -Irene Freize, in-
structor in Psychology, and Maur-
een Greenwald, instructor in His-
tory, talked enthusiastically about
the program they’ve come to
Pittsburgh to be a part of.

who would not allow SG to stage

  S.G. ToSetile Ring Controversy

by KAREN BURGIO

Anbody wanting to buy a Pitt
ring had better wait for a while
until the controversy cools off.

The official Pitt ring will be de-
cided upon Thursday night when
Student Government will hand
down its decision concerning the
sale of rings in the Student Book-
store. There may be more than
one company to choose from.

According to SG President Tom
Bailey, the Balfour Company has
produced the official University
ring for 40 years. Last year, the
John Roberts ring was introduced
in the Bookstore and sales were at
a 1-1 ratio.

Over the summer John Roberts
moved from Oklahoma to Texas
and orders for sales were not be-
ing picked up at the Bookstore.
Then the area salesman quit, add-
ing to the confusion.

Mary Bonak, manager of
the Bookstore, then took the Rob-
erts ring off display.

In the meantime, the Balfour
Company designed a new Pitt
ring, one which included the Ca-
thedral of Learning—a reason the
Roberts ring was so well liked.

Josten’s Ring Company got
wind of the controversy and ex-
pressed a desire to be put in the
Bookstore.

- Bailey then decied that the only
fair way_to settle the matter was
for all three companies to sub-
mit new contracts to the Student
Government Board. Balfour’s will
be submitted tonight, Josten’s
Tuesdaynight and Roberts’ Wed-
nesday night. The final decision
will be made Thursday night at 8
p.m.

“Bonak has sa_id -that she

doesn’t want to have three differ-
ent companiesin the store,” Bail-
ey said. “But what’s interesting
is that the Balfour Company, al-
though here for 40 years, may be
asked to leave. '

Williams

“The only thing now is to sit
back and see what happens—we‘ll
(Student Government) have a de-
cision and a statement on Thurs-
day night,” Bailey said.

Williams, a Republican, admit-
ted that he felt the Democratic
partv gives fairer representation,
within the _part_v to blacks. But
he added, “If I am not elected I
think it will set the Republican
and the Democratic parties back
politically. If I’m not elected, I
think it will be 10 years before
anybody will come up with a state-
wide black candidate again. I
think, if I.am~ elected, both par-
ties will begin to look and see that
voters are paying attention to
qualification. I think that would be
a great hope to the younger gen-
eration.”

Williams described his own reg-
istration as a political reality for
his local constituency. He has
served a four and one-half year
term as Harrisburg’s City Con-
troller. In Dauphin County Repub-
licans outnumber Democrats 3-1.
However. he feels that statewide

party labels hold less meaning.

Williams was born in Dauphin
County and went to school there.
He received a B.A. in Economics
from West Virginia State Univer-
sity. Presently he is involved in
many Dauphin County political
and civic organizations. This is
his first statewide campaign.

ciplinary nature, she hopes it will
give women the chance to make
their own disciplines more rele-
vant to themselves. She recalled a
psychology textbook that announc-
ed at the beginning that the ex-
periments it would treat would
deal solely with men because
women were too complex. It also
gives women the opportunity to
express their points of view, for
example, to challenge Freud’s in-
terpretation of the psychology of
women.

Pitt’s program can be meas-

ured by the fact that there are
only a few, possibly six, other un-
dergraduate programs in Wom-
en's Studies in the country. The
faculty expressed hope that other
institutions could draw from
Pitt’s experience as they formu-
late Women’s Studies programs to
fit their individual needs.

Greenwald, who came from
Brown University where she help-
ed found the Rhode Island wom-
en’s liberation movement, said
she has been impressed with the
"tremendous community of wom-
en” that characterizes Pitt.

One of the immediate goals of
the Women’s Studies Program is
to establish :courses in every de-
partment of the College. Right
now interested faculty members
can conceive and formulate their
own course and present them to
the Women’s Studies Curriculum
Committee for consideration and
possible implementation.

Courses being offered this term,

include “Development and Repro-
ductive Biology of Women,”
taught by Marilynn Goldsmith of

-..-President Thieu’s Foreign Policy advisor, Dr.
o Wei Nao, has recently returned from an ex-
jended trip abroad. His visits to Paris and Otta-
‘a-, were publicized, but his whereabouts during
 stay in Ottawa were unknown for at least
' orty-eight hours. Reliable sources now report .

on alert status.

 

 

Speaking from his jail cell, the surviving Op-
position Representative was quoted as saying:
“No matter what they call it, I know we‘re about

i to get dragged into supporting a corrupt dictator
ten thousand miles away. This is not, and should
not be, any business of the RVN.”

More objective evidence suggests that direct

intervention may very well be planned. Scattered

yet.

bombing and strafing of civilian activities on the
west coast USA have been traced to Forward De-
fense Units stationed off the coast of neighboring
Canada, though no confirmation is available as\

The location of these alleged attacks, three
thousand miles from Washington, the capitol of
USA, suggests that the bombings may be intend-

‘ ed as a warning to the Soviet Union, which is
widely believed to be supporting the insurgent
political groups.

The RVN administration would neither con-
firm-nor deny their participation in the raids,

RVN and USA.

but a Thieu spokesman, who declined to be iden-
tified. said that such activities had always been a
part of “realistic contingency planning” in both

There has been no direct response from Wash-

ington, possibly due to the remote location of the
alleged attacks, but leaflets claiming to repre-

sent the opposition viewpoint have claimed‘ that
“USA is now under attack by the foreign allies
of a government seeking to hold by force the loy-

alty of anation they have deceived."

Mr. Agnew, speaking for the USA govern-
ment, dismissed the leaflet as "Seditio/us silli-
ness palmed off on the people by a bunch of bab-
bling babboons bent on burying all that is best
in our superior society.”

. He did not respond directly to the charges.

Our sources indicate, however, that Thieu does
intend to “return all the favors done to the people
of RVN by the people of USALT"A'more definite
announcement is expected shortly. It may be signi-
ficant that one report states that President Thieu
may convene Parliament for the first time in seven
years, for “emergency business.”

A Nixon representative would only comment that
“The USA alliance with RVN is as firm and re-
ciprocal as it ever has been."

He also declined

of the act? No. A government,
like its citizens, has no right to
initiate coercion of any kind.

The American franchise affords
one, in this election, the oppor-
tunity to condone theft in various
degrees.

Mr. Prozzi, representative of
College Young Democrats, makes
a valid point when he demonstrates
the inequity of the present tax
structure. Many overblown, inef-
ficient and unresponsive industrial
firms, for example, are privileged
by the U. S. tax system, in that
the “excessive” profits of their
smaller, more competent competi-
tors are absorbed by the govern-
ment, thus hindering progress and
establishing economic stagnation.
But his proposed remedy would
surely kill the patient.

Libertarian writers, in books and
articles too numerous to list,
have offered many sound volun-
tary and just alternatives to coer-
cive taxation. See, for example,
Ayn Rand’s “Government Finan-
cing in a_ Free Society,” in her
book, The Virtue of Selfishness.

In closing, I should like to in-
form Ms. Bitensky of the Com-
munist Party that neither Richard
Nixon nor his goon squad quali-
fy as capitalists. Color them fas-
cists. You may recall, Ms. Biten-
sky, (though you will disagree with
my interpretation), that when
Richard Nixon established wage
and price “guidelines,” he estab-
lished as well the precedent of a
totalitarian society. But then (I
suppose that you, as a member
of the Communist Party, Ms.
Bitensky, would know more
about totalitarianism than I.

Dear Editor,

I have just returned to my room
after another finely prepared
Szabo dinner. Upon doing so I
must immediately run to my
"munchies” cupboard and com-

‘ mence devouring box after box

of Kellog’s cereal. After crunch-
ing through three or four boxes of
Sugar Pops and Puffa Puffa Rice
you begin to hate cereal as
much, if it’s possible, as Szabo
food.

One might ask me, if he or she
has not eaten in our cafeteria re-
cently, why I live on mere grains
and corn when the cafeteria offers
such a wide variety of meals. To
these people I reply that I agree
there is a wide variety of meals.
You can take for example the
Special Saturday Shoe-Leather
Express Steak or the Rubber-Dil-
do Hotdog served for Tuesdays
lunch. They can take them al-
right, and I only wish they

. knew where to stick them.

The quality of the food is not
by far the only fault found in our
cafeteria. One of the other major
ones is cleanliness. It is said that
cleanliness is next go godliness,
surely then the Pitt cafeteria is a
form of hell. It was not too bad

at the beginning of the term, but’
the sanitation department of the _

cafe must be on strike or some-
thing. In the past few days I
have had to sort through/about
six forks, 10 spoons, and who
knows how many knives each
tirlié I went to eat before the
magic jackpot of a clean set was
hit. This type of gambling could

, eases including very serious ones

  Nixon’s   T Plan   o
Re-evaluated) I

by BARRY PARSONS _
Science fiction must be Lynn Alstadt’s real bag.) His "facts"
on Nixon and taxes are obviously from another world. The world in
which we live is an America which, in the last four years of King
Richard, has seen: “ -

1) the unemployment rate rise from 31/2 to 5 percent
ing a $50 to $60 billion tax revenue loss to the government),

2) the highest prices in 14 years (Nixon inflation control. any-
one?).

(represent-

3) Six million more people added to the welfare rolls (while,'

Richard Nixon clearly—+and one can only assume intentionally—— is
letting his own avowedly top priority welfare reform bill die in
Congress),

4) an increase in the national debt of 23 percent.
' 5) a phenomenal $75 billion federalbudget deficit, and
6) the worst foreign trade imbalance in this century, for two
years a running, 1971 and 1972. A

Nowhere is Young Aldstadt deeper into some nether world than
when he maintains the idea that Nixon is working for tax reform
and tax relief, as if the two could possibly be divisible under a
“responsible” tax program. Both elements sing out with exceptional
clarity in McGovern’s well-researched tax program (good re-
search, Mr. A, uncovers errors which “responsible” men acknow-
ledge and correct). Rarely, if ever, in our history has a presidential
candidate been so specific on tax policy before and election: $54

billion dollars in additional revenue (through Defense cuts, increas-.

ing tax rates on income from capital, returning to a corporate tax
rate structure similar to that which-prevailed under Eisenhower,
and an increase in inheritance.taxes with exemptions for property
left to spouse and moderate-sized estates) and $39 billion in addi-
tional expenditures (subsidies to states & cities to cut property
taxes in half; $6 billion for public service jobs at the minimum
wage; pollution, health, rural & urban development, & transit; in-
creasing by 7/8 the minimum monthly payments, through Social
Security system, to the aged; blind and disabled; and a federal
streamlining and liberalization of the existing welfare mess, with
a $4,000 minimum income for a family of four (Nixon’s HR 1 bill
would have it at $24007).

That leaves $15 billion surplus which presumably will be
applied to rising expenses’ of" existing programs—until the phased-
down military budget takes effect and inflation is genuinely re-
duced through increased demand resulting from the increased em-
ployment that will take place under a McGovern—administration..

There will NOT, as Alstadt says, be a 50 percent tax increase
for “the taxpayers of America” with McGovern’s proposal (there
likely will be one of that magnitude under Nixon’s non-plan). Tax-
payers making under_ $20 to 22,000 in wages, salaries, dividends, or
interest will not experience a tax hike but, on the contrary, a tax reduc-
tion, increasing in proportion down into the lower income brackets.
Those above this break—even point will experience tax increases to the
extent that their actual income, as is commonly the case in the higher
brackets, comes from capital gains, tax shelters, accelerated deple-
tion allowances, etc. ’

The Nixon 1969 “tax reform” bill was an over-advertised absurd
ad hominem to the absent-minded American public (how’s that,

Spiro?). Nixon’s own Assistant Secretary of Labor, Jerome Rosow. re- —

cently in the New Republic, stated that the 1969 act “does not
provide adequate relief” (my emphasis) for the lower middle-
class, due to the BASIC TAX STRUCTURE, which was left un-
changed. For example, tax deductions for dependents add up to more
for higher income earners than for moderate and low earners. You

‘can’t have it both ways, Mr. Alstadt: real tax relief equals real

tax reform.

And what is the Nixon tax plan for 19_73 and beyond? Where is
it? The answer is, there is none. Instead we are told that the Nixon
people are “studying. . .” as they have been for the past 19 months.
Studiousness is great, but the people want—and have a right— to know
what would be in store for their pocketbooks under each candidate.
We have heard only that Nixon is going to cut property taxes (Who

iisn’t‘?) That is one item, not a program. But.how is Nixongoing to

make up the revenue loss and cover other-regular expenditure in-
creases. Why, with the Value-Added Tax, so the carefully leaked,
preparatory White House story goes.

But VAT is a grossly regressive sales tax, the exact opposite of
tax reform. To make it fair, ‘Nixon would have to sweeten it with
lots of tax credits to the poor and lower (and middle) classes,
making the net revenue gain relatively small. ‘How then would
Nixon finance the huge deficit, estimated now_ at about $12 bil-
lion (on top of the $75 billion he’s already built up)? Again, this is
another secret plan, but the nature of the answer we can expect with

"four more years” has been revealed by the Administration bill just -~

passed by the House: unilateral power to the President to slash the
PROGRAMS ALREADY PASSED BY CONGRESS, WHEREVER HE
WANTS in order to keep expenditures within a proposed $250 billion
debt ceiling! This is how Nixon is “fighting . . to prevent the need
for more taxes. And where will the cuts be? Why in HEW, of
course. Like Manpower training, for example. But the obvious

larger danger here is a fundamental change, surely unconstitutional,‘

in the very heart of our governmental structure and concept of the
separation of power.

. THIS is clearly the most radical proposal of the campaign. __

 

Godspell In Pittsburgh
 For Limited Stay

“Godspell”, the internationally acclaimed musical adapta-
tion of the Gospel of St. ‘Matthew, will open its national tour at
Pittsburgh’s Nixon Theatre. Previews begin October 20 with the for-
mal opening—-a premiere benefit performance for “The First Stage:

Performing Arts for Children" sponsored by Carnegie Institute-set.

for October 27.

Conceived and directed originally by John-Michael Tebelak
with an original score by Stephen Schwartz, “Godspell” is pro-
duced by Edgar Lansbury, Stuart Duncan, and Joseph Beruh. The
national touring company is directed by Nina Faso.

For everyone involved with “Godspell,” the Pittsburgh engage-
ment has special significance, for it was here at Carnegie-Mellon
that John-Michael Tubelak first conceived the project as partial
fulfillmant of his master’s thesis. Encouraged by the response, Tebelak
and his cast scraped together their funds and set out for’New York.

Only during the _last sequences of the production does the Pas-
sion and Crucifixion enter into this spirited production, for
Tebelak has drawn from the spirit of Christ and his teachings rather
than from the Bible in its literal sense. Judaism, Zen, Baba—all reli-
gions profoundly influence the presentation which is at its heart an
attempt to create a new mass for today. -

“Godspell,” which is the archaic form of the word gospel, at-
tempts to envelope its audience with its message of joy, communica-
tion and renewal; "Godspell” is in essence Eucharistic Theatre.$a

In the last year or so the “Jesus Freaks” have begun to out-
number panhandlers on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley and the
Sunset Strip in Los Angeles; reformed addicts have started hold-
ing non—denominational church services in living rooms; a mystical

_ religion based on the teachings of Meher Baba bloomed in The
".‘t’ho’s- rock opera “Tommy”; “Jesus Christ Superstar” and “Joseph »

and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,’_’ composed and written
by two young Englishmen, Andrew Loyde Webber and Tim Rice,
have made an indelible impression on young America—and now on
the crest of this wave of spirituality in the young comes “God-
spell,” an answer to the age of despair.

Since‘leaving Pittsburgh for New York nearly two years ago,
“Godspell” has opened in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Wash-
ington, Toronto, Chicago, London, Paris, Montevideo, Hamburg,
Sydney, and Melbourne. The film version of 'the.musical is now
being filmed on location in New York with a cast drawn from
various national companies and from the original New York
cast.

“Godspell” will continue in Pittsburgh through November 25,
playing Monday—Saturday evenings at 8:30 p.m. with matinees
Wednesday at 2 and Saturday at 2:30 p.m. For information call

I confess that I know very
little about the use of drugs, my
experience being limited to the
tiny tube of cortisonewhich I
employ in my? never ending
battle against the Heartbreak of
Psoraisis. However, I have a
friend who is constantly shooting
up something or other (at last
report he’s quit concentrated
orange juice and is now getting
off on Tang), and this dude usu-
ally seeks me out whenever things
get hairy. Last night was no ex-
ception. Seems he had this dream,
this vision of the future.

“First off, it’s 1976 and it’s the
Republican convention, see?” My
friend looked very excited, count-
ing off the details of his dream
on his fingers. “Now, the Republi-
cans don’t want Spiro runnin’ for
President, even if he do got a
new image. ‘But Spiro, he’s really
got his little ole heart set on the
Presidency, andhe’s kinds strung-
out. I mean, they did promise him
and everything, right? so the Re-
publican leaders work out this
deal between Spiro and Johnny
Carson—”

"Hold on, there,”

I said, my
tohurt. "How’d

‘Johnny Carson get into this?"

“Well, in this dream, the Re-
publican Party owns NBC by

thoughtfully. “Or is it the other
way around? Ah, who cares, it’s
only a dream.”

String Players Capture Rustic Sub

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

The shortage of competent
string players has reached almost
acute proportions in the past few
years and it is certainly not a
rare occurrence when the string
section of A many an orchestra

proves itself to be perhaps the
weakest portion of the orchestral
sonorities.

Occasionally. we receive the
opportunity to hear the strings of
our orchestras in solo sectional
"spots," and during this past
weekend, Pittsburgh audiences

, _ heard their local ensembles

string players in just such a sit-
uation under conductor Donald
.Johanos. And while our bowman
hardly showed themselves incom-
petent during their playing (nor
proved themselves the ‘dregs of
the orchestral forces), a certain
weakness in tonal quality was ap-
parent throughout their rendition

Q of the Dvorak  Major Serenade.

A When refined tonal quality
comes to mind, our ears must un-

 ,3 fortunately turn to our sister or-

 

 

 

chestra across the state and the
very fine string ensemble that Mr.
Ormandy, _.has assembled within
.it. There can be no doubt of the

’ tempermental nature of 9 string

instruments and there can also be
little doubt that our local strings
have yet to overcome this tem-
permentality. Rather than the pro-
duction of the smooth, flowing

tone that the Dvorak demands, we —

were instead greeeted with a
“scratchiness” that became quite
blatant in the absence of brass,
woodwinds, and percussion.

Needless to say. the rustic na-
ture of the serenade was compe-
tently conveyed and Johanos‘ cap-
abilities on the podium were re-
affirmed as he made his first ap-
pearance of the season. The really
unfortunate thing about the sere-
nade is the fact that it is so large-
ly neglected; the only Romantic
serenade we hear these days
would seem to be the Tchaikovsky

and here we have a work which,
has just as great a wealth of mel-.

ody and has been totally ignored.

From the realm of the string
ensemble. we must turn to the ac-
complishments of the string solo-
ist. and in particular. the work of
the PSO’s concertmaster, Fritz
Siegal. In this weekend's pair; Sie-
gel offered the usually mistaken
"conventionalities" of the Bruch
First Violin Concerto with mar-

-velous artistry. His double stop-

ping was indeed effective through-
out and his quickly paced per-
formance down to the -horse race
finish of the finale was remark-
ably clean and precise.

Siegal has offered a major con-
certo of the repertoire every sea-

son during his tenure with the.

symphony and it, has been with
these performances that we all

.have come to realize his impor-

tant contribution to our orches-‘V

the Nixon administration.

t'ra’s achievements. Few orches-
tras have been so fortunate as
ours in regard to the presence of
a competent concertmaster.

In addition to the Dvorak and
Bruch. the program also offered
a “no strings attached" composi-
tion-—“Integrales" of Edgar Va-
rese. While “Integrales" has

manifested itself as one of those
classic examples of noise pollu-
tion in the concert hall. it is still a
work which gives the orchestral
forces the opportunity to display
their capabilities without ever-
present strings. ‘
Completely devoted to experi-
mentation with sounds. Varese

Heﬁes

has moulded his composition
-around three dissonant climaxes
which he demands be analyzed in
objective. scientific terms. Al-
though this listener cannot_possi-
bly hope to accomplish this cri-
terion. he can at least wonder how

so few musicians are able to make .

so much noise.

on our hands and knees.” Johns-
ton concluded his speech by stat-
ing a vote for Nixon would assure
“four more years of prosperity.”

The longest and most virulent
address was given by Stephanie
Coontz. representing the Socialist
Workers Party. She opened her
address with an attack on both the
Republicans and Democrats.
claiming both parties share a sim-
ilar goal: the preservation of
American business
throughout the world. "We have
a society which puts private in-
vestments ahead of public inter-
ests." Coontz stated.

Coontz advocated revolution as
the only means for affecting any
major change in U.S. policies.

“‘The only gains the American

people have ever made in this
country were when they stopped
working within the system.”

fective way to achieve objectives.

At the conclusion of her speech.
Coontz was given a round of ap-
plause which the other speakers
did not receive.

A question and answer session
followed the prepared speeches in
which moderator Susan, Christian,
former YWCA director, often had
difficulty controlling the proceed-
ings.

,‘Stinson questioned Coontz on

the validity of equating McGovern
with past Democratic candidates.
Coontz replied that McGovern
used "McCarthy's techniques to
channel anti-war sentiment into
the Democratic party" and that

. he refused to help publish the Ben-

tagon Papers, indicating his simi-
against you.”

 Stinson then gave a long rebut-
tal. defining McGovern‘s econom-
ic policies and stating that Mc-
Govern's only "black mark" was
his vote in favor of the Tonkin Gulf
Resolution. '

Johnston countered this speech
by stating McGovern could have
voted against the Tonkin Resolu-
tion. He also mentioned McGov-
ern’s frequent shifts in policies,
stating if elected “he may say one
thing and do another.”

After.this impromptu debate.
questions from the audience were
accepted. S'tinson. however. had
to leave because of another en-
gagement. -

Coontz was asked to give one
realistic reason to vote f'or the So-

cialist candidates. She replied. "A
vote for the Socialist Party will
be the only vote that won‘t be used
against you." explaining that both
parties support industrialism and
war.

Both Johnston and Coontz were
asked which of the two major par-
ties proposed more realistic po-
licies. Coontz replied there was
“no difference,” while Johnston
stated although he admired Mc-
Govern’s idealism, his policies
would “hurt the U.S. more than
Nixon’s.”

After his reply. Johnston «had to
leave the discussion. but Coontz
continued to answer questions.

She was asked what concrete-
solutions the Socialist party could
offer to solve such problems as
unemployment, l‘acism._ and infla-

. tion. She. replied that by national-

izing the major corporations ’

("change society so there is pro-
duction for public use instead of
private gain"). unemployment
could be eliminated and economic
stability achieved.

Coontz termed a statement from
an SDS member that the socialists
were only running candidates ev-
ery four years but not building a
movement as an “out and out lie.”

Coontz closed by saying. "TIl€‘&'

most important thing you can do
IS not to vote on Nov. 7. but to use
the other 364 days of the year to

organize" against the policies of I

the present political structure.

Being from a steel and mining
family in Minnesota, he empha-
sized the Nixon tax swindle, al-
lowing corporations grossing $50
million to pay no taxes while
40 per cent of steel workers
wages go into taxes.

Reviewing the present admin-
istration‘s Vietnam policy. Gus
Hall compared Nixon to an alco-
holic always intending to stop af-
ter the next one. "Nixon has no
intention to end the war. Troop
withdrawal is an illusion of re-
escalation in Southeast Asia.

Ending his prepared statement
without a reference to the Demo-
cratic candidate. Gus- Hall was
asked his opinion of George Mc-
Govern. "McGovern is different
from Nixon in that he is liberal.
But. under pressure McGovern
will compromise with big busi-
ness and co_rD_0ration profit. Mc-
McGovern has promised to end the
bombing on inagural day and the
war 90 days after.“

“All it would take is a 90 second
phone call to President Thieu on
inagural day which I plan to make
if elected. All troops from Indo-
china and the 200 overseas bases
would be removed.”

Canceling all war contracts.
the Communist Party candidate
would "reorganize the tax struc-
.ture. and priority spending. The
state would be transformed from
a warfare to a welfare state.”

Gus Hall has served as the Gen-
eral Secretary of the-U.S. Com-
munist Party for the past 12 years
This is the first time he has run

Reinstated ‘CAS Cabinet Seeks
To Solve Academic Trouble Spots

by SHARON SEXTON
The CAS Cabinet is presently be-

ing reinstated after an oversight .

by the Student Government Con-
stitution Committee omitted it
from the new constitution.

Ron Eskin. who has been ap-
pointed as chairman for the Cabi-
net. explains. "The committee
has been given standing commit-
tee status. I assume that this will
be only temporary. Hopefully it
will give us time to restructure
the Cabinet before it becomes
really functional."

Eskin is planning to change the
old structure of the Cabinet by ap-
pointing student representatives
from every department within the
University to serve on the Cabinet.

"In the past the Cabinet has
been run primarily by the chair-
man. he acted or rather reacted
to student gripes. requests. etc.

I'd like to organize a Cabinet ‘
, made “up of students who actively

try to identify those problems

, which are bothering the students

they represent. After the prob-
lems have been identified the stu-
dent will bring them to the Cabi-
net members and we will find
a workable solution."

Eskin elaborated. "In addition

ties. the representatives would be

Eskin said, “This is one sure

phasized that the CAS Cabinet is
the only organization which rep-
resents the needs and opinions of
the students in the College of Arts

Eskin is also hoping that one of
the new Cabinet's projects will be

"Faith Healer Tells r Own ‘ Story 7 ~ i

_ , by JOHN CAPITMAN

'A good freak-you know. not too
much different from you or me.
sits on a. waterbed in tight ‘blue
jeans. paisley shirt and blonde
afro." 'He’s been talking, but it
didn’t. make much sense. And
-then he sort of smirks and says.
fIt'Glory bi to Jeesus! “

 Like this freak is Marjoe-the
.b.0Y#Wonder-preacher. who grew
up with the same US of A as we
;did.'Wel1 not exactly. because at

’went on tour, to spread the word
‘of "Christ as your personal savi-
or;" And then at fourteen. cause
he was kind’a mature. he split
»fron_1 his parents and went to Los-
tngeles to be a gigolo. ‘cause
e had found "karma and all
.-that."

But, like he needed bread, so
eiwent back to preaching. He
idn’t‘ believe any of the sin
1/stuff so he knew he couldn’t
{really hack it. But he knew that
‘t -was like something he could
lways fall back on. So he got

ogether with a couple of his-

.'friends and they did this flick
_'bout the trip of Evangelical

meetings.
And its kind’a a neat film.you

know, there’s lots of music, that
ood old.GoSpel sound — and then
here are these weird old ladies
fho freak out and _lie on the
loor writhing, sort of in hot flash-

}four_he hit the road—you know—,

es. every time this dude Marjoe
lays a hand on ‘em.

And its all sort of sad - this
guy knows exactly how much
bull he’s lettin‘ go down. Like
he knows that he doesn't believe
it, and that it's all these people
have to believe in. He knows that
he’s stealin’ from them.

But it’s like something so much
a part of him that when he get’s
on stage he just lets all this
crap come flowin’ out. But I guess
that now, since he’s made this
flick it’ll be done for him-and he
can get into something else.

I don’t know, it was a really
nice flick, but wow, if this is
what this dude is really like, he's
got a lot of stuff to go through be-
fore he gets his head together.

* * *

There is quite a bit more than
the above to be said about Marjoe.
the new movie produced and di-
rected by Howard Smith and
Sarah Kernochanwich, playing

at the Shadyside Theater. It is

perhaps a truly original cinematic
form that could be termed“A self-
pitying autobiographical docu-
mentary." c

As a documentary Mar joe
exposes the big business of
spreading the Gospel. . One

becomes almost painfully con-
scious of the hypocritical, self-
serving, vaudeville sordidness of
the almost endless series of

Movie TracesPreacl1er'S Life  

fraud that are used tosteal mon-
ey from America’s people with
this particular product.

The anti-hero, Marjoe. rejects
this religion of "love“. but not
the pleasure that he attains from
the money and attention gained
in proselytizing it. And thus the
shorts from old-newsr'eels are

pathetic, tender, but ambiguous. ’

The life was hard for a four
year old, but he did get some
kind of pleasure out of it.

And the current scenes are

equally ambiguous; the preach-'

er enjoys himself—enjoys watch-
ing people writhe under his hand.
But these scnese effectively por-
tray the emotional void that we
call the American mentality-
the need for a disembodied sav-
ior who may be brought to our
back-yards and TV screens by a

comgination of Mick Jagger and

Elvis Presley.

As autobiography, however.
the filmis unsettling.-The direc-
tors have somehow failed to dis-
tinguish between Marjoe’s self-
perception and the reality of
the Revival Meeting.

Marjoe is provocative.
exciting, entertaining and im-
portant as a modern film expose
of "Big Time Religion.” Marjoe
should be seen as the film, that
does for Evangelism what say, or
Gimme Shelter did for Rock.

Gremlin Colony. Launched

by KAREN BURGIO

mGremlins invaded the Pitt News last night and the walls of the
office Will never be the same t_hanks to their bearded, doodle-
freak originator, Gene Mater. '

Gene is the man behind Gremlin Village. which often appears
on the editorial pages. He also is the owner of Clark. a;German Shep-.

‘ ard who likes Winkey’s donuts.

Gremlin Village is Gene’s way of life -- and he-is one of the
very few cartoonists that caters exclusively to college papers, being
found in such diverse locations as the Universities of Miami and
San Francisco, the State University of New York and his alma
mater, Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa.

"The Gremlins were a character that a friend of mine used when
we were in high school in Germany around 1964. Gremlin is-a World
War II term for explaining the unexplainable—if planes were sabo-
taged. the Gremlins did it.

"Physics was the class I doodled in the most here in the States,
and one of the girls in my class noticed, the Gremlins, and said, ‘how
cute.’ Shortly afterward, I started drawing them for our high school
paper.vand made a last minute effort to come up with a name be-
fore the deadline. Since Greenwich Village ‘was the big thing then,
the doodles became inhabitants of Gremlin Village. Everyone moan-
ed at ‘the pun and I’ve tried to come up with another name but
couldn’t, so I thought I’d stick with that one,” he said.

"When I got to Lehigh_University, I wanted to learn a little
more about college and to make a name for myself. And since there
weren’t any cartoons in the paper, they were more than willing to
accept them.” .

“Being a political science major, after graduation I found a job
as the manager of the service division of a car dealer. But sticking
in one place for 40 hours a week wasn’t worth it. Ninety percent of
the people that work don’t enjoy what they do and this is a‘ statistic
I didn’t want to be a part of.” . ’

A number of the, cartoons are sent to 20 campuses once "every
two weeks and they pay for the number they use. In his own words,
“I’m not a business man and I never will be.”

He continued, ‘‘I’m basically a pretty insubordinate son of a
bitch and I treasure my independence. My chief desire is to remain
as free as possible and that means avoiding marriage and kids—my
only dependants are Clark and the cartoons.

“Gremlins -are usually reflective of human beings, the same way
that there are fascist-pro Nixon type people,“ there are fascist-pro
Nixon type gremlins. The_ ideas come from two sou_rces—national or
campus issues. I rely on the circulation people on campus to supply
me with news of what’s going on there and if it’s a topic that appears
elsewhere, I’ll use it. ' '

“I didn’t consider the possibility of my own business not_working
out—that was being optimistic and foolhardy. I try not to think too far
in the future, but it looks optimistic.” S

In a December, 1968 interview for the Allentown Morning Call, 

Gene said, “I’ll be persuring a political science career, unless an
opportunity in cartooning presents itself.”

And it did.

Despite Northwestern’s appar-
ent willingness to ‘turnover’
Saturday afternoon’s football
game, the Pitt Panthers refused
to capitalize as they wound up
on the short end of a 27—22_score.

The Wildcats donated nine
fumbles to ‘the Panthers’ cause

_ four of which were recovered by

Pitt.

These turnovers enabled the
Cats to establish a 14-0 lead
early in the first half, a lead
they quickly relinqished in the
closing minutes of the

ahead 21-14. What appeared to
be a certain victory for the Pan-
thers soon' deteriorated into
their fourth loss of the winless
season.

After trying to reassure his
team that they were still capable
of winning, a dejected Pitt coach,
commented,
“It sure was a tough loss. It was
a tough game. ‘We lost, that’s
all.”

If ever a single break proved
to be the difference in a foot-
ball game. a kick-off return

seemed to be the one for the.

Panthers.
Within a matter of 19'seconds

Northwestern came up with the '

big play that paved the way for
a Wildcat victory.

After junior quarterback Bob
Medwid put the Panthers back
in the lead midway through the
fourth quarter, disaster struck.

western after Medwid’s 62 yard

per Mark Krumtinger returned
the boot to the NU 35 yard

line where he was stuck by the
Pitt specialty squad and coughed
up the football.

In a freakish type play the
ball squirted into the arms of
Northwestern’s Steve Craig who
carried, it to the Pitt 43 yard

"line. On his first carry of the

afternoon, the next play of the
game, Greg Boykin turned a
simple trap play into a touch-
down run, putting NU ahead,
27-22. .

Although there remained approx-
imately eight minutes left in the
game, the Panthers never recov-
ered from this fourth quarter
blow.

“It narrows down to that one
big play at the end of the game,”
recounted DePasqua. "These are
the things that happen all the
time—you just have to try and
preventit.”

The Wildcats’ head football
coach Alex Agase also felt that
the ‘big play’ in the fourth
quarter was a decisive blow to
the Panthers.

“The second half could have

- gone either way,-we were only

14 points behind,” related the
Northwestern mentor. “But we
got the big break when we need-
ed it. They smashed us on the

.,,€-MU, Moses Stopped;

Booters Continue Drive

by BART MACK

Just as the’ Israelites had"Moses
to lead them into the promised
land, the Carnegie—Mellon soccer
team had their Moses to leadthem
in its would-be upset over the
Pitt booters.‘ '

But the biblical Moses never
made into that promised land, and
Peter Moses himself was not
enough to power the Tartans
over Pitt as the Panthers continu-
ed their unbeaten ways, downing

«'3.-.C-MU, 3-0.

Moses, the Jamaican—born
center ‘fullback for the Tartans,
put on quite a show of his soc-
cer talents at Pitt Stadium Satur-
day afternoon. His individual ef-
forts, however, were not enough
to counter a stingy Pitt defense

RAY REX

.v4“,'._ ‘

 

and an offense that
started to put it all together.

Moses, along with his team-
mate Goran Bencic, proved to b_e
the only offensive threats that
C-MU had, but those two men
alone kept the Pitt defense in
riddles throughout the first half
and parts of the second.

finally

Bencic and Moses worked as
if they grew up playing soccer
together as their passes were
picture perfect and almost always
to one another. Moses, in par-
ticular, gave the Pitt defense fits
with his brilliant ball handling.

Pitt goalie Bill Haines felt
Moses’ presence perhaps more
than anyone on the field. Haines

‘finally had to face a good shoot-

er and came up with several ex-
cellent saves.

“He (Moses) is by far the

best individual player we’ve seen.
so far. He could release a good I

shot with either foot,” Haines
commented.

Besides containing Moses, the
booters were also at odds with
another problem. The weather
proved to be a very important
factor, especially in theifirst
half. Both clubs had trouble with
wet grounds and the damp wea-
ther seemed to slow the first half
play almost to a standstill.

Up until the 21:25 mark of
the second half, Moses and the
weather gave the Panthers a
fight. Joe Luxbacher netted his
first goal of the game at that
point, which was all Pitt really
needed.

Luxbacher and the offense were
having trouble connecting on their

passes but John Curly fed Lux- ‘

bacher with a beautiful pass down
the middle and Luxbacher fired
from 20 yards out to ‘put Pitt
in the lead.

Four minutes later, Lenny
Raffa sent a pass from midfield
over the heads of the C-MU de-
fense, setting up Luxbacher for
his second tally. Luxbacher out-
ran a lone C-MU fullback to the
ball, broke to the right wing and
fired the ball past a helpless
John Lape into the left corner of
the net. ‘

C-MU roared back with their
last serious threat of the game
that ended in a wildscramble in
front of the Pitt goal. After stop-
ping a pair of close shots, Haines
found himself flat on his back
with a crowd in front of the nets
and the ball somewhere in be-
tween. But before any Tartans
could get a foot on the ball Haines
sprawled to grab it and cover up.

The rest of the contest turned A

out .to be shooting practice for
the Panther offense. With the C-ML
defense obviously fatigued, Ray
Rex put the icing on the cake
with the final Pitt goal at the
39:20 mark.

Although the win gave the
booters a 2-0-1 mark, the team
suffered a setback in Saturday’s
contest. Interior lineman Al Jutca
will be lost for the remainder of
the season with a fractured tibula.
Jutca sustained the injury in a
collision .in front of the C-MU
net.

Pitt will continue their drive
to make the NCAA playoffs when
they travel to Philadelphia next
Friday to meet Temple. Last year
the booters downed the Owls,
2-'1, here at Pitt.

and it turned out to be the ‘win-
ning play. It was tough to do but
we won it.

“I ‘feel’ for Carl because it
seems that Pitt is snakebit," add-
ed the winning coach.

Guided by strating quarter-
back John Hogan, it looked like
the Panthers were in for a big
afternoon. . ‘

To say that Pitt'Stadium was a gloomy place Saturday ‘I
afternoon, about four o’clock, would be saying the very least.‘ , "

Monday, Oc'tober2, Ii9i72—’iI‘HE Prrir m‘vs_p.*ge 9 P   

True, it had rained all morning and the air was crisp, but

situation wasn’t relieved any by the preceding football game.-. 
That would be the game between the Pitt Panthers and the -o ’

Northwestern Wildcats.

This was by far the worst exhibition of football the Pan-. 

thers have thus far "been involved in this year. Despite the
close score of 27-22, to’ say that what took place was a good

football game would be being very very kind. That however 

is another story.

When Bob Medwid faded back to pass with 7:20 left on, 7.‘,
the scoreboard, there was still hope that Pitt could salvage the-ﬁe
game and.turn a gray day into a warm and sunny one, at least. ”

in the Panther locker room. ' _
Medwid, replacing an injured John Hogan,scrabbled around '

in his own backfield and looked like he was going to" get, i ’

caught for a loss. With Wildcats closing in on him, Medwid let
loose a long,‘ wobbly pass which found its way into the open
hands of split end Tod Toerper.

, WOW!‘Pitt was ahead 22-21. On the way to victory; Rah.
Rah, ‘Rah. ' 9

What happened? Pitt kicked off and the next 19 seconds. 

w_ere enough to make the most loyal Pitt football enthusiastic

turn into the nearest wastecan and puke, or at least break into."-if

a long weary cry. ’ -

A fellow by the name of Krumtinger took-John 'White’.~; ,

kick at the Wildcat nine yaui line and returned it to the -35

yard line. There, receiving one of the harder Pitt tackles‘, ,~ ..

Krumtinger turned the play into a humdinger instead.

He fumbled the ball, into the hands of Steve Craig, at 

least five yards ahead, who gladly took it like a forward pass

and kept returning it to the Pitt 43. From there, freshman back . 

Tom Boykin ripped off a 43 yard touchdown run on the very
first play from scrimmage and Pitt was once again behind.

It could only happen to Pitt.

Don’t get the wrong impression. One can blame the coaches, , 
others can blame the players, I blame the curse that has been ’ ‘

hanging around Pitt athletics since 1963.

You might haveheard that in ‘C3 Pitt went'9—1 and didn’t-
receive a major bowl bid. Since then, everytime the University

seems to have something going, the unexpected—or is it the ex-  E“

pected—always happens. Pitt's Monkey’s Paw plays its role. 1

You might remember the story of the Monkey’s Paw. A
family is granted three wishes through the auspices of an ape’s
hand. '

Their first wish is for money and the son dies, whereupon

the money is received through the son’s insurance. heir second

wish also goes assunder and the third wish is for the dead
son’s life. Yes, the son returns. to life in the same form as he
was in the casket——mangled from his accidental death.

Carl DePasqua had three wishes when the season opened.

He hoped that his team would win, he hoped to please hungry ‘ _.~"‘
Pitt fans, and he hoped that his job would be secure going 

into the fifth week of the season‘. None of these has occurred.

The next time a panther starter is carried off the field-
there have been eight so far-'—the next time the Cats give up‘ the

_ big play, the next time something unbelievable happens to - 
I the Pitt__footba;ll team, blame '

points in that period. Concen-
trating on an established running
game, the only time NU went to
the air was to get two points
after its second touchdown.

in the third quarter.

Pitt's Mcirtin Cops First

by LYNN HARRIS

Pitts cross country team open-
ed its season Friday with a loss
of 20-35 against an unexpectedly
good Kent State Golden Flahses
team. Although it was the first
dual meet Pitt has lost in four
years, there was one outstanding
highlight. '

Nick Martin, a 1972 graduate of
Carrick High School, finished first
with a time of 30:59.

, “I was pleased with my per-
formance, yet disappointed the
team lost” was Nick’s comment.

The number one man at Carrick
High ran the longest course he had
ever run. Used to his high school
course of two and a half miles,
the six mile course was a chal-
lenge but he miet it.

“I tried to stay behind Kent’s ’

lead runner to keep pressure on

him, then with the last 50 yards 

approaching I pulled out,’’. he
commented.

A disadvantage that Nick p0int- .

ed out was the fact that the Kent

course was flatter than Pitt’s and _

the team wasn’t familiar with it.

Pitt Head Coach Jim Banner, 5

who unfortunately could’t make
the trip due to a knee injury was
disappointed, but said his team

- was a young one.

“They are a good group,” was
the Banner comment. Referring
to the level of the program this
year, Banner said he will “use the
dual meets to work up to the big-
ger ones,” ultimately aiming at
the IC4A and the NCAA".

After Nick Martin placed first,

   

freshman; Richard Markley, a
sophomore, and Micky Collins, a
sophomore from Easton, Pa.

Assisting Banner this year are
Don Mollenhaur and Smitty A
Brown, who coached the squad at
Kent State. The Harriers worked
all week in Schenley Park with
practices twice a day. The work-
outs were held at 7 a.m.and 4
p.m. with the team running appro

Although no meets will be held
in Pittsburgh this year, there are
five meets left on the schedule.

1, What was responsible for the
budden change in the Northwest-
lrrn offense. an offense that fum-
lled six times in the first half?
the answer is only two words.

im Trimble. ,

The stocky sophomore carried
.’he ball 13 times for 57 yards and
we touchdown in the third quar-
ter alone, and ‘proved to be the
sustaining force that turned a

, sputtering Wildcat attack into a

smooth, grinding machine.

On the whole, Trimble carried
26 times for an even 100 yards,
set up one field goal and scored
one touchdown himself. Remem-
bering that he only ran one play in
the fourth quarter, those statis-
tics are __very impressive.

In a day where the pigskin seem-

 ed to elude the grasps of every-
‘\on<-3-igkfrimble faired well, although

he did have some trouble hanging

" "ir"The ball was really slippery at
the start of the game,” Trimble
“It might not have

looked that wet. but it was soak-
ing wet under the surface of the
turf." '

But Trimble and Northwestern
were no strangers to losing the
ball, having played Notre Dame
the week before. “We fumbled
some last week,” Trimble said.
“I dropped two myself against
Notre Dame.”

The third quater proved to be
the turning point for both the Wild-

fense. a defense that did not im-
press Trimble at all.

"After you‘ve played against
the Notre Dame defensive line.
well then everyone looks small.
even though Michigan wasn’t that
big." remarked Trimble. '

After a shaky first half, North-
western settled down and began to
play like the team that they could
be, or at least similar to the team
that held Michigan to only seven
points.

“Our films helped us a lot."
Trimble commented. “We had re-.
ports on Michigan and the films of
the Pitt-Air Force game. but did-
n‘t have anything on Notre Dame
at all."

If there is anythingbright in the
immediate future of Northwest-
ern football it is the fact that their
team is composed of mainly
sophomores. including Trimble.
"We have a lot of sophomores."
Trimble said. “You might say
that this is a rebuilding year for

Souvenir Siegel recaptured sec-
ond place from ‘Nub Zchunkmo by
posting a 10-5 mark while the

another 10-5 week. Cid erred on
the Pitt game, the Boston College

California and Army upsets.

Rupert Buccigrossi just smiles.

It’s the perfect autumn day :

sunny, but crisp and cool,

with,the smell of burning
leaves and the colors of
changing foliage." A great
afternoon for getting into '
the mood of the season and
carving out that pumpkin.
And even though it’s “that
time” of the month, you’re
feeling really happy, with a"
smile as broad as the pump-
kin’s. Because you Maseuse
have the comfortable 
feelingyof Tampax Noam?‘
tampons’ internal sanitary
protection. And the confi-
dent feeling you get because
Tampax tampons free you
from irritation, odor and
worries. Comfort, freedom.
and conﬁdence are impor-
tant to you and to women all
over the world, so it’s no
wonder more women trust
Tampax tampons to help «
keep them smiling.

  
 

Dur only interest is protecting you.
