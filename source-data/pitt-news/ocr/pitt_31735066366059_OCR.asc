New Law Eases Drug

by MIKE MILLER
" Editor

The Controlled Substance Drug,
Device and Cosmetic Act of
1972 which took effect in Penn-
sylvania last Wednesday makes
possession and use of marijuana
or hashisha misdemeanor. This
law replaces the Drug, Device
and Cosmetic Act of September
26, 1962, which classified such

an offense as a felony.

The law states that amounts
of marijuana weighing under
30 grams or hashish weighing
under eight grams will be con-
sidered a "small-amount." .

The maximum penalty for pos-
session or transfer without pay-
ment of a “small amount” of
these drugs is 30 days in jail or
$500 fine. ' »

Possession or transfer without ' A

payment of greater amounts of
these ‘drugs is still a misdemean-
or with /a maximum penalty of
one year in jail or a $5,000 fine.

Trafficing in large amounts of
these drugs can lead to 15 years
in prison or a fine or a quarter
of a million dollars. This crime
is considered a felony.

Under this new law a first
offender may plead guilty and
be placed on probation for a
period not exceeding .the maxi-
mum time of imprisonment.
When the probation is fulfilled,
the court _must discharge the
offender without an adjudica-
tion of guilty.

If the probation is violated
the court can enter a judgzr
ment and proceed as in any
ordinary criminal case, or con-
tinue the probation without ver-
dict. ’

This provision does not apply
to drug pushers who are not

themselves users.

Other provisions include medi-
cal treatment‘ for persons de-
pendent upon drugs in lieu of
imprisonment at ‘ the discre-
tion of the court. ,

Bob Ging, Chairman of the
Student Government Legal
Awareness Committee call the

‘act “a good law." ‘

However, Ging found some
sticking points. “The problem is
that nobody knows how the law
is going to be enforced,” he siad.
“There are certain ramifications
that ‘people arent sure of.”

A Ging was uncertain of whether
a magistrate can grant probation
without goin— through the court
process.

“The way the text of the law
reads it states that a court can
grant probation and it includes
magistrates and justices of the
peace in the definition of courts,”

GIL “Fewer gray areas" I

Ging explained.

“We don‘t know ifmagistrates
will do this at the hearing or
make you go through the court
process,” he said.

With the enactment of this law.
Ging said,’ “Drug use is on par
with underage drinking.”

Superintendent of Campus Se-
curity, Joseph Gil, stated that he
had not yet determined the ef-
fect of the new bill on his policy
of treating marijuana use as a
counseling matter.

However, he said, “I’m in-
clined to think that the new law
is more beneficial to our (the
University) environment than the
old one.”

“The language of the new law '

is more specific,” he said. “It
may eliminate sone of the grey
areas we’ve had in the past. A
defendant .is not subject to indi-
vidual interpretations as in the
past."

Resident Life Office Created to

Improve Dorm Quality, Relations

by MIKE MILLER

The Office of Student Affairs
ahp the Housing Office have
‘announced the creation of the
Office of Resident Life which
will function under the Dean of
Student Affairs and concern it-
self with “the supervision of

Resident Assistants and imple- .

mentation of residence hall stu-
dent programs.“

Other administrative aspects of
the residence halls will remain
with the Director of Housing.
John Vrana.

Alfred Moye, Dean of Student
Affairs, explained that the new
office resulted from a “Feeling
that we might get more milage
out of our personnel is we sep-
arated two generations."

Vrana reported that the Hous-
ing Office has consisted of a
Student Personnel division and an
Operational division. both under
his supervision. He described
the creation of the new posi-
tion as an effort to make the dis-
tinction between. the two jobs

and provide for greater coopera-

‘tion among all concdrned.

Moye stated that the Coordina-
tor of Residence Life will, “han-
dle all things related to the
quality of life in the dorms."

This, according to Moye, will
include programming. This pro-

gramming will not be financed _

by student activities fees and a
source of funding has not yet
been determined by Moye.

He also said that the type of
programs instituted will depend
upon the wishes of the students
living in the dorms.

While _the office change will
take effect in July, a Coordina-
tor of Residence Life has not
yet been chosen. This will be
done,” as soon as we identify
the person,” Moye said.

According to a joint statement
issued by Vrana _and Moye.
“While the resident assistants
and other student personnel
staff in the Office of Residence
Life will report to Student Af-
fairs. 'the_v will cooperate and

work with the University Hous-in

ing Staff on operational mat-
ters."

Two thousand prospective freshmen students representing‘ al-
most all of the class of ‘76 are presently at Pitt experiencing their
first task of collegiate academic and social life.

The group includes 1,500 students staying in Tower B and

I Brackenridge. McCormack and Holland Halls, as well as 500 stu- .
dents who are getting their first taste of commuting from home to .

Pitt.

Transfer students and members of minority groups admitted
under special programs will undergo orientation later in the sum-
mer. ‘ I

A different format than those used in,/"previous years was de-

_ veloped for Orientation ‘72. The primary emphasis of this year's pro-I 
gram will be on academic matters,,rather than on the social and" ‘
political activities which occupied a great deal of the time in pre- .

vious orientation sessions.
To accommodate thd increased emphasis on academic matters

numerous faculty members and upperclassmen were/-invited to par- _-

ticipate in the program. A ratio of 13 ‘newcomers to one orientation
personnel will be maintained throughout the orientation
which ends Thursday afternoon.

’ Dave Wahl, a student in charge of the orientation program, re-

igvealed that faculty participation has. been disappointing. Six hund-

red faculty members were asked to participate in the orientation, 
but only 50 will play an integral part in the program. ‘

Students who will be coming to Pitt from great distances will '.

register during this session, while commuting students will be asked '
to register later during the summer. Spaces are being held open in ‘,
all courses so that freshman commuters will not be closed out of _

classes because they are registering late.

The.activities scheduled for Sunday,,Wednesday and 'l‘hursdayV§
will include Nursing, Engineering and College of Arts. and Sciences C

students as a whole, while those scheduld for Monday and Tuesday

grams. Individualdepartments and pre-professional‘ committees are

sponsoring special seminars for prospective.stud_ents. '  ’ "

Student services and activities will highlight We nesday’s ses- 
sion, as the Student Goyernment, Panhelenic Socidty, Commuter 
Association, Angel Glight, ROTC, the Pitt News and other campus 

activitids present programs directed toward the newcomers.

S/ocial activities for the session are quite diverse. The facilities
in the gym and the Student Union will be opened to the freshmen
Monday night. Students wishing to attend ‘the dance Monday even-  .

ing at the gym must wear gym shoes due to University regulations. g
On Tuesday evening Cool Hand Luke and Anne of a Thousand f-

Days will be shown. COTA is sponsoring a rock festival Wednesday '-

afternoon while a watermelon picnicwill be held simultaneously.

Students will be encouraged to mingle with faculty and their_i

mentors informally during Wednesdays social session.

All night movies will be shown Wednesday night headlined

Wait Until Dark and a comedy film festival.

With the increased emphasis on academic matters, the orienta- 

tion planners hope that orientation ‘72 will prove to be enlightening’

and worthwhile experience, for the students who will‘be entering g
the mainstream of college life in September. '  ' ”

‘ Much is being said today about

The six-year-old program is de-
signed to aid women, ages 30-50,
in preparing or a care’er in the ur-
ban professions. Most candidates
are housewives seeking a new ca-
reer now that their children are
grown, or women already in the
labor force who have decided to
change careers. A bachelor’s de-
gree is the usual prerequisite, al-
though exceptions have been
made.

Students work toward a mas-
ter’s degree, either in Public Ad-
ministration or Urban and Re-
gional Planning. Most women in

fully completed the course to

ed with such services as Alle-

Anything Else?: I

by CH UCK STEE BER

Louis McLinden. Associate Di-
rector of Student Activities. will
take over the position of advisor

to the Graduate Students and,

General Studies (two different
groups). This is a new position
within Student Activities.
McLinden first started with
Student Activities in March of

_ 1866 in charge of Off“ Campus

Housing. In July of 1967 he took
over Parker Enright’s position as
advisor to’ the Interfraternitv
-Council. McLinden has held that
position up to the present. He will
start his new _position
time in July of this year.

' McLinden was a graduate
of the" Pitt class of 1951 where he
earned his Bachelor of Arts. In

1969, he earned his Masters of Ed- ‘

ucation. As an undergraduate at
Pitt he was a member of Delta

some-

F/ell.0Wsl1i1) Pl‘()gI'£ll11‘SCCl{iS to Place McLinden Takes New Position

Tau Delta. He has been an active
alumni ever since.

McLinden commented on
his five years here at Pitt as an
administrator. "They were five
enjoyable years. I’ve made many.
many friends. I still keep in touch
with many of the people I met at
the very beginning."

Looking back on his’ five years
he had one disappointment that
was in the area of fraternity
housing. “In the five years, we
haven’t been able to get adequate
housing. We have worked with the
alumni and students of the individ-
ual (fraternity) chapters. But so
far no answers have been forth-
coming of the plans for a fraterni-
ty complex.

I--r11 miss dealing with the
fraternities and the fraternity
problems. but I’m looking for-
ward to the new job.”

IN COMPLlANCE,with the City's annolinced one-way traffic plan for
Forbes and Fifth Aves.~; the following changes in our shuttle bus
service must be made effective by Monday, June I9.

The starting point, the Cathedral stop, will be moved to Bige-
low (west side of the~Cathedral) near crosswalk from Schenley

some change) the route followed will be Bigelow to_B_aird to Be le-

seith to Terrace t‘o‘DeSotto and then cross Fifth and go by way of

FFreshma11 Weekend I   Pilot Mentor

\

Plannetl for September

By JOHN SIMELIS

The difficulties traditionally
associated with one’s first term in
college stem from a lack of
familiarity with a new environ-
ment. A freshman may find that he
mustgo out and make friends as
a first.step in adjusting to his new
situation, but this alone will
not eliminate the problem. He
still is not acquainted with es-

;sential aspects of a.large univer-
sity. What will classes be like?
Will he be treated as a person
or just a number_?

Freshman Fall Weekend, now
40 years old, has eased count-
less freshmen into university life
through an informal program of
During the three
days of the weekend, you will
meet_many members of your
Freshman Class, interesting pro-
fessors, . involved administrators,
and active upperclassmen.

While-=imostwfres»hmeni «will» see
their teachers only in _large lec-
tures. you willhave the oppor-
tunity to meet informally-with
professors from many depart-
ments, and when you get back
to school it will be much easier
for you to take the initiative of
talking to any of the other in-
structors outside of class about
anything. It‘ can help a lot if
you‘re on the borderline between
two grades and the prof recog-
nizes your name out of the hun-
dreds there rather than thinking
of you as just another number. '

You will meet the establish-
ment. better. known as the ad-

. ministration. and learn first hand
‘of the problems‘ of student in-

volvement. Most important of all
you will meet one another and
develop" friendships that
last throughout your college car-
eer and perhaps your lifetime.
- When-is Fall Weekend?‘

Unlike previous years. Fall
Weekend will be held before

will

classes begin so you won’t have
to worry about academic prob-
lems at camp. The weekend will
start on Saturdagn September 2
at 2:00 p.m. when the buses ar-
rive at the Student Union and will
end Monday, September 4, (Lab-

or Day) sometime in thelate af- I

ternoon.

Although most resident stud-
ents won't officially check into
the dorms until Sunday, Sept.
3, you will be able to move in
anytime on Saturday priorto
leaving for camp. Since classes
won’t start until Wednesday,
Sept. 6, you can just throw your
things into your room on Satur-
day and still have plenty of time
to straighten them out when you
get back on Monday. For a small
fee (3.50/-double room; $4.50/sin-
gle room) you may check in Fri-
day, Sept. 1.

Where is Fall Weekend? '

I

"=""Fall~ Weekend‘-will be held at

Camp Kon-O-Kwee, located near
Zelienople, Pa.. approximately

. one hour from the Oakland cam-

pus. Camp Kon-O-Kwee’s excel-
lent facilities include a large out-
door swimming pool. four hard-
top tennis courts. volleyball
courts, basketball courts. three
turf football and_ soccer. bout
docks. many campfire areas. and
a beautiful outdoor chapel to ac-
commodate religious services.

How Much Will it Cost?

The total cost is $16. This fee
includes all meals. sleeping. ac-
commodations, transportation and

' insurance. There will be no extra

charge for anything except re-
freshments bought,at ca mp.‘
Applications will be accepted
on a first-come first-serve bas-
is. Since we_ are expecting a
large turnout you should get it

_in as soon as possible. You. can

A new Pilot Program was intro-
duced at the recent Mentor train-
ing camp held at the Pitt campus
during the term ‘break.

The revised goalsof Mentor un-
der the Pilot Program. as explain-
ed by Mentor Chairman Terrie
Amelio. are to promote an ongo-
ing orientation for freshmen. to
serve as peer counselors and re-
source people, and to give ‘atten-
tion -to academic issues which
have been neglectedin the past.

The four day training workshop I

was divided into four areas: ex-
planation and application of small
group dynamics, orientation to-

. University programs and serv-

ices, discussion on the philoso-
phy of the educational process,
and presentation of the -Mentor’s
role at the June orientation for
freshmen.

The group dynamics program
was lead by Jim Yaksich. vice-
president at Slippery Rock State
College. The explanation of group
dynamics tore the group process
into a series of one-to-one rela-
tionships. A lab exercise involved
the group in a joint production of a
poster. emphasizing the roles of
the individual group members in
the total functioning of the group.

One evening of the workshop
explored the black-white experi-
ence. Dr. Lloyd Bell. Assistant
Vice Chancellor of Public Affairs
and director of Urban Community
Services. descriptively reviewed
the history of blacks in America.
relating it to interpersonal rela-
tionships between blacks and
whites. To further explore the
black-white relationship. small

discussion groups met with blacks. .

As a resource source, the Men-
tor will be expected to be able to
give outginformation on many,of
the University’s programs and
services.

Yes, the world is in pieces allright —— pieces that need to be picked up and put
together again so everyone’s needs can be met. Before the pieces can be put together
the rough edges need to be smoothed: people need people.

If we wonder if our society was made for man, we must reaffirm that man is made .
for man. We must be human together.-Where our society hurts, hassles or humiliates
people, people must be there. For to be where people have needs is to begin to re-

17A Q Few Good People

The graduation of 19 staff members last “April has left

 .,the Pitt News with a serious personnel problem. The re-

_- maining staff members will be seniors in the fall. It is our

i hope that we can recruit some qualified staff members from
the class of ‘76.

' The Pitt News publishes three times per week in the fall
Al-
though we concentrate our coverage on campus news.

" we also cover local and national news which is pertinent to

the University. - ‘ _
In the past year our reporters have met such people as

A Ralph Nader, Shirley Chisholm, George McGovern, Peter
- Yarrow, Zit Blemish, Don McLean, Betty Friedan, Carl
 Stokes, Vincent Price,

Neil Sheehan, Walter Hickel, and
Wesley Posvar (the Chancellor).

.In‘ the next few months we anticipate coverage of the

 ';‘Rolling Stones, Alice Copper, Norman Mailer. Germaine

Greer, and Wesley Posvar (the Chancellor).

In addition to meeting such people, thePitt News
offers students practical writing experience, rapid advance-
ment within the organization (all editorial positions will be
left open with the April graduation), a forum for expressing
opinions, salaries, travel, and pizza parties at 3 a.m. on
deadline nights. 0 ‘

,Your work on the paper can easily be tailored to your
academic or commuting schedule. -

The Pitt News also covers intercollegiate athletics, fol-
lowing such sports as football, basketball, sports car racing

(Pitt ‘has theionly college sports car racing team in the U.S.),

tennis,-karate, wrestling, soccer, baseball, track, gymnastics,
and swimming. '*

Not all staff members are writers. We have positions for
photographers, artists, layout and production people, and ad-
vertising salesmen.

The Pitt News like any other‘ newspaper, is a business.

A Each year, the. Business Office of the Pitt News spends be-

tween 80,000 and 100,000 dollars to operate the paper.

While selling advertising is the backbone of the continu-

,_,ed financial success of the Pitt News. it is the production

people who design attractive ads and lay them out which

_ keeps the advertisers coming back and attract new ones.

\

Other personnel constantly keep‘ in touch with the busi-
ndss community by sending advertisers copies of all the is-
sues in which their ad appears.

Promotion is,\ the theme of the coming year,’ and the
Pitt News staff will be out in the business community more
than ever.

Not all staff members are writing majors. The present
staff has representatives from such diverse fields as political
science, biology, speech, nursing, physics, chemistry, econo-

mics, psychology. and art.

If you would like to know more about the Pitt News,
stop up at our open house Wednesdayafternoon from 1:30
to :30 in 407 Schenley Hall. We’ll look forward to meetingyou.

is little more than a-drop in the A

bucket. But what significance
does that effort, that experience
have for that one man?

It can mean quiteia lot to him.
At least it has to me. A year or

so of political‘ involvement has

left me looking back on a’ long
trail of day-to-day happenings,
day-to-day victories and losses.
day-to-day changes.

There were. the sweltering
days of last August and eaNly
Sdptember, helping put togeth-
er a voter registration rally and
trying to spread the word about

it to the young population of -

an entire country—with both
Pittsburgh newspapers out on
strike. And the day of the rally
itself, a warm, beautiful after-
noon, marching with John
Kerry into Point State Park
with a vibrant crowd of 15,000
people. ..

There were the meetingswith
the political‘ personalities who
have made national headlines

in months and years past.hear--
ing Ted Kennedy speak briefl

after an appearance at a $100-
a.plate dnner. Heading off to
a Homestead union. hall the
day before any last final exam
to hear George McGovern talk
to a gathering of pensioners.
Standing in the midst ofa crowd
captivated by a Humphrey
speech or dropping in on a

' fund-raiser to listen to Ramsey

Clark in Pittsburgh during a
break in the trial of the Har-
risburg7.

And you can‘t leave out the

countless miles that were ‘logged
during those months. There

were the long weekend trips like .

the one to New Hampshire in
early March, driving through the
fog and snow to canvass for
McGovern before the first presi-
dential primary of the year.
There was the unforgettable bus
ride to a ‘St. Louis convention
with an unforgettable busload
of kids. And a change-of-pace
political conference held at a
campsite along the Maryland
seashore.

Local places would/ fascinate

you, too. Out on the road making-

deliveries of campaign liter-
ature for a congressional can-
didate you would pass through
areas no more than six or _seven

.miles from Pittsburgh that look-

ed like the backwoods of Ken-
tucky.‘ Returning to the cam-
paign headquarters, you would
drive through sections of the
city that rivaled New York’s
worst ghettos, with the U. S.
Steel Building and Three Rivers

Stadium glimmering in the
distance.
There’s a variety of little

things that makes certain days
stand out in your memory more
than others. Things like losing
a position on a" slate of conven-
tion delegate candidates by four
votes at a meeting of over 150
people, painting and cleaning
up an office in the Student
Union, waking up to a phone

. political

call from a furious candidate
chewing you out because your
organization backed his oppon-
ent.

Hectic election days and tense
election nights. The feeling of
accomplishment that comes
from a call from a local candi-
date who knows you’ve got some
clout and who’ asks
for your help, or an invitation to
work on a campaign in New
York.

Any guide to points of inter-
est in the Pittsburgh area should
include a note about what its
political scene has to offer. With
hundreds of candidates run-
ning for office every May and
November there is always some-
one worth supporting. Occasion-

ally you even run across a de-

cent congressional or presiden-
tial aspirant on the ballot.

Opportunities for a campaign
of your own are also within
reach. During this past primary
election, at least a dozen young
people, from Allegheny County
some-of them Pitt students, ran
for the positions of delegate and
alternate delegate to the Demo-
cratic National Conventivn. Four
of them won. Others have run
successfully for local party of-
fices.

No doubt these new politicians
have their own stories to tell,
stories about people and places
that~\they’ve run across along
the campaign trail. Some of

1 them will be at Pitt this week

to talk about them.‘

They’ll be at an Open House
in the College Young Democrats
office, 301 Student Union on
Wednesday, June 21. Stop up
anytime between 3‘ and 7 on
Wednesday, grab .some free re-
freshments and talk with some
of these kids. Maybe you’ll wind
up in the ridiculous game of
politics yourself before too
long.

Beware of The ROTC Pitdl

By JIM HOLLAND

If you are an entering student,
you face an intensive sales pitch
by ROTC and ARFROTC. To pre-
pare for the pitch, the ads, and
the inducements you should know
that ROTC’s mission (as defined
by their own official regula-
tions) is to produce ca'feer and
reservist officers. Their pitch
rests heavily on the draft.

But last year’s_ top lottery num-
ber was 125, this year it is ex-
pected to be much lower, per-
haps not over 50 (New York Tim-
e_s,_Jan. 1, 1972), and next year
a zero draft is expected. The
threat of the draft applies, then,
only if your lottery number is
low and you are in this year's
lottery. ,If so, get draft counsel-
ling, available near campus at the
University and Oakland Minist-
ries(UAOM).

It is not true that your only
alternative is to be drafted as a
private. The selective service law
provides other means of serving.
Perhaps you qualify as a C.O.
You no longer have to oppose
violence in all circumstances
or base your belief on the ten-
ets of an organized religion. but
taking a ROTC course will hurt
your chances.

On the other hand if you have
no objections. enlisting in the
National Guard is an alternative
to the draft. You get six months
training ‘and two weeks of sum-
mer camp each year for six years
—- all with pay: Now they, take

.you in‘ the Guard even after

you’ve received draft notice.
There are other deferments too,
so call UAOM before being
stampeded into ROTC.

Consider too the implacations
of the ROTC pitch that “if you
must serve, why not as an offi-
cer.” It is at least debatable
whether the lot of a second lieu-
tenant is better than a private.
The 2nd Lt. is at the bottom of
the heap also had hassled by
higher officers and non—coms
alike. '

-Look closely at the financial
inducements. The scholarships
usually require longer active
duty and the $100 a month in
your 3rd and 4th years is one of

those half truths. You only get

the money by joining the re-
sdrves and signing a statement
saying you will accepta com-
mission. Then if you don’t com-
plete a series of courses: you are

"bf! Tour: "I lfullrnirilr J¢runuiIi.InI" .

immediately called up as an en-
listed man (your lottery number
isn’t relevant)..

The cost to you is high. To
complete the program you will
have finished a minor in mili-
tary courses but without credit.
Then, on graduation, you must
serve two to four years. The de-
la in starting your career could
more than offset the pay

The worst problem is the ear-
ly committment forced upon you.
The end of the sophomore year is
too early for irrevocable com-
mittments. College is, after all,
a time to explore ideas, to grow.

to find out who youare, and to‘

establish yourself as a self ac-
tualized indepenpent person.
ROTC’s main claimto personal’
development isthat it “instillsa
respect for superiors” (from the
Army Brochure, Your Son and the
Army ROTC).

'iTh'ick Brick’ lSinks

 Tull After 'Aqlutlung’

by BARBARA GERAUD

Jethro Tull is back again. this time with "Thick as a Brick." an
unfortunately mediocre album, and a distinct letdown from the magni-
ficence of "Aqualung."

Another “concept" album. TAAB is purportedly a musical rendi-
tion of a controversial poem by an eight—year-old genius named Gerald
“Little Milton” Bostock, and little Gerald is given credit on the album
for co-authoring the whole thing with Tull’s flutist and lead singer, Ian
Anderson. ,

Reprise has even been generous enough to provide us with a 12-
page newspaper, the St. Cleve Chronicle, the local paper from Little
Gerald’s home town. The paper -is much more interesting than the

7 album, and certainly much more informative.

Conveniently, this particular issue of the Chroncile contains the
complete text of Gerald’s poem. It seems that this epic had won a lo-
cal Literary Competition sponsored by the Society for Literary Ad-
vancement and Gestation (SLAG), but was disqualified when “four
leading. child psychiatrists decided the boy’s mind was seriously un-
balanced and that his work was the product of an ‘extremely unwho1e-

73)

We are left to assume that 01’ Ian felt sorry for poor little Gerald
(who wasn't really so bad off—another article in the papter reports

on his_14—year-old girlfriend. who claims eight-year-old Gerald is the" ‘

father of her unborn baby) and decided to help him out by writing mu-
sic to his epic and making an album of it.

He shouldn’t have wasted his time. The lyrics are, at best, strange,

4 and at worst, nonsensical. “But your new shoes are worn at the heels

and/your suntan does rapidly peel and/your wise men don’t know
how it feels to be thick as a brick.” Sure.

The music isn’t much better. It’s repetitive to the vergeof being
boring. Anderson’s flute playing is on its usual level of excellence, but
his voice is beginning to war on the nerves. The instrumental passages
are much too long and leave one wondering when—if ever—the record

‘ is going to be over.

. Borrow a friend’s copy to read the newspaper—_—it’s hysterically
rib-tickling, but don’t waste your own money on the album. I regret my
having done it.

Interesting Crap Time

- by VINCE Di NARDO

Wrestling coach Dave Adams wasn’t an old
Brooklyn Dodger fan, but he used one of their say-
ings to sum up his feelings when last year’s season
came to a close. In a letter to alumni, Adams said,
“Wait until next year.”

In a lot of ways, last year was a bummer for
Adams and his crew. He just called it "disappoint-

~ ing.” "He started the year with three of New York’s'
best wrestlers. At the end, all were gone. None by

graduation. Furthermore, a couple of other wrest-
lers were rumored going all over the globe. The two
Paynes (Mark and Tom) and Scott Ross left schol;
Dave Whylie was out with an injury, as was Flem-
ing just before tournement time, going through a
stunt for a TV camera. It was that kind of season.

Adams, however, thinks all that is behind him

and the team. '

“I would hope ‘we have a better yearthan last
year,” he said. “Our dual meet season may not be
as good, ‘but by tournament time I think we’ll be
much better.” I '

Coming off a good recruitingcampaign, Adams
feels he will have a better balanced team when the
referee yells “wrestle.” Right now, Adams is
wrestling with himself . because he can’t’wa.it til
that time comes. Kevin Love, Geroge Bryant,
Craig Trich, John Chatman and. company return
andAdams should be eager.

, “We’re enthusiastic about getting started,” he
said. “We didn’t have a great recruiting season,
we didn?t get all the boys we wanted, but you

-never do. We had a good ‘season though and I think

we’ve got an interesting group. They don’t have a
reputation, but they have the potential to get
one. Right now, I consider every spot at every
weight class open to anyone.”

lThe Keese of Death)  

When head basketball coach Buzz Ridl thinks of
Bob MacAdoo, Lionel Billingy, Tom Burleson, Tom
Riker, and Mike Heitz he has all the right in the
world to become a little dizzy and nauseous.

Considering what these hoopers did to him

“last year one could not blame him, nor could they

‘Due to recent circumstances, it has become apparent that .

Pitt Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski made the right
.choice by naming Al Smith as one of his assistants, a black
' assistant,lastyear.

Recently, Smith was offered the head ,, athletic direc-
- tor’s job a Michigan State University.

Smith, however, liked what he saw at Pitt and has de-
cided to stay.
' * ' III *

Just as Myslinski promised earlier, the faculty repre-

sentatives of the Big Four schools (Pitt, Penn State, West

‘ Virginia, and Syracuse), will meet on June 28 to try and to

‘T come up with a congruent academic acceptance criteria,
-amongother things ..

West Virginia uses a different criteria than the other
three schools, but theirmethod‘ is also approved by the
‘ NCAA and any change will have to_ come out of the meet-
‘V-_ing.:‘ ~ . - . e

    
  

blame him for setting out to get a big man, some-
body like Lucius Keese.

The big man proved to_be the kiss of death for
Pitt basketball last year, but could very well work
the other way nexttime around.

Ridl’s big men (Paul O’Gorek and Bill Sulkowski)
weren't big enough, they were only 6-8. 1-

"‘I really believe that-if we would have had a big 

man in there we could have Won four to five more
games,” Ridl has said time and time again‘. “It was-
n’t that their (the opposition) big man was that good
but the fact they had him in-their made the differ-
ence. ’ “

If Ridl wanted a big man, he got one in the per-
son of Keese. At 6-10, 230 pounds Lucisus fits the
big bruiser, the intimidator type needed. Not only
does he look- the role,,but defense has been and will
continue to be his forte. He thinks defense. I

Coming to Pitt with a 20 rebound, 14 point aver-
age, the’, St. Petersburg J. C. star has an objective
in mind.

“I plan to get a degree in two years. I expect to .

be on a winning team and I want to make a name for

‘myself,” he said, preferably a name that pro scouts

will come to recognize.

Lucius Keese didn’t ha .}e to be a big scorer for
St. Petersburg. ‘The Largo, Fla., native had two of-
the top scorers in the state on his teams in his two
ydars and he was there to pull down the rebounds
and block shots. With a range of five to 10 geet Lu-
ClllS seemed content to stick aNound the hoop. And
even though he plans to work on his shots all sum-
mer——like from around the foul line and the top of

the ‘key, he’ll,be_ around the_hoop for the missed ‘

shot_s. . V _
s ‘,‘.I think defensively,“ he said, “I want to get that

-V rebound and block the shot.”» _ , .

' professionally,” he saidpriort‘ to the: draft.

 

  

That should make all the wrestlers happy.
The “good and solid” group that Adams re-
cruited is headed by name players Raymond Dalla-

tore, the 165 pound State champ, and Jeffrey,

Minerd, the 180 pound State runner-up. According
these
wrestlers are coming
in with great poten-

Seemingly, Adams
has no great problem ,
bringing in great ,
wrestlers, but some-,'
thing always happens

“We’ve had enough '
injuries in the last ‘
couple of years to last
us for‘ the next ten
years,” is the way he
sums up his feelings
on\the subject.

Art.-Nakazato (118),
Lud Hanczar (126),
Ron Selfridge (134),
John Buzzato (142),
and Gary McLure will
all return to try and
turn the injury riddled tide. Adams is‘ also count-
ing on John Robba to come back from his football
injury to add some depth. '

Adams seems to have recruited at least one
wrestler for every weight class to complement the
already existing talent. And, with a few more
wrestlers yet to be announced, Adams feels the
season should be able to roll. '

Anxiously Awaiting

Now if just the injuries, TV cameras, and other ,

strokesof bad luck would just cease to play a role,
Adams _won’t have to wait until next year as the

' Brooklyn Dodgers often did.

with, Keese must have done a lot of thinking.
Keese was the captain and twoyear starter for

St..Petersburg. He was named to the All Division \

III of the_Florida Junior College Conference and
was -selected to play in the state’s junior college’

all-star game—in which he collected 15 points and,

Furthermore, Keese knew nothing about Pitt". His
coach, George McGrossin, who captained the Pitt
team in 1950 told Tim Grgurichiall about him. In
turn, Grgurich told Keese all about Pitt.

How does Lucius Keese feel about being the tall-

“I feel pretty good about it.’ Now I’d like to make p ‘

‘ Penguins Fare Well

In Hockey Draftings   3 Sport Med Symposium  

by RON SIEGLE
The Pittsburgh Penguins came

1 out of last week's draft meeting

at Montreal in fine shape, losing
only one man'in the intra—league
draft and threeplayers in the ex-
panion draft.

Judging from the players that

H /were lost, it was a good week for

the Pens. Of the four, only Bob
Leiter played any kind of role in
the Penguin fourth place finish
last season.
Leiter, acquired in an off season
deal from Hershey of the Ameri-
, can Hockey League, got off to a

_ great start and when the season
T’ was over had 14, goals and 17 as-

sists to his credit. The 31 year old
center admitted to the Pens that
he was talking seriously with the
rival WHA and this was_a factor in
his being left unprotected.

The other two skaters lost were
leftwingers Keith McGreary and

' John Stewart. Stewart spent the

season shuffling back and forth
between Pittsburgh and their min-
‘ or league affiliate, Hershey.

McCreary, an original Penguin
from the expansion draft five
years ago, has been injury riddled
in recent years, and this coupled
withhis age, 32, influenced his
being left unprotected.

Veteran Tim Horton. who again

1 announced his retirement, was

drafted by the Buffalo Sabres in
the Inter-League draft. It is not
expected that he will play for the
Sabres, but the Pens got the $40,-
000 drafting fee anyhow. Horton

PENN STATE’S Greg Fredericks
blazed through a sensational
final lap at the AAU Track and
Field Championships Friday
night, in Seattle, to set a new
American Record in the 10,000

meter run.

Fredericks’ 28:08.0 time en-
abled him to break Billy Mills
1965 record. Fredericks’ run
was also the fastest 10,000 A
meters ever run on American
soil.

was a dissappointment last sea-
son, especially in-the playoffs. His
$100,000 salary was quite a bur-
den on the team’s finances. He
missed much of the regular sea-
son witha broken ankle. -

What left the team in fine shape
was everything that happened
and didn’t happen, in Montreal.
What happened was the drafting
of two fine prospects in the ama-
tuer draft. What didn’t happen

.was that none of the experienced

goalies, Les Binkley and Roy Ed-
wards, left unprotected, weren’t
taken.

Also not taken in the drafts
were veterans Ken Schinkel, Val
Fonteyne, and Eddie "The Enter-
tainer” Schack.

The best thing that didn’t hap-

pen was that not a single Penguin
has been signed by the World
Hockey Association. In fact, most
have already signed with the
Pens. With other clubs losing
players left and right, the Pens

can’t help improve their rankings _ V

as they remain» the same while

others weaken. Also, with goalies V

jumping to the other league, the
Penguins can make some good
deals for golaies Binkley and Ed-
wards.’ ' . ‘
Oshawa defenseman Jack Lynch
was Pittsburgh’s first amatuer
pick. The 6-2 bruiser scored 18
goals and 38 assists last year in

the OHA. Second pick. Bernie _ 

Lukowich, scored 38 goals for
New Westminster of the WCHL.
Either player has a chance to
make the team this year.
