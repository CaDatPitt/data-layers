ICG Will Mark Fifth
Birthday I/Vith Model

‘Governor’ Conference

By RUGY ALDISERT

Besides being the date of our
student elections, April 21 marks
the ﬁfth birthday of an intercol-
legiate government group that has
outgrown its “fad stage” and de-
veloped into a permanent institu-
tion.

Organized in 1934 by two Uni-
versity students, Miss Genevieve
Blatt, C33, and John P. Bracken,
C34, the Intercollegiate Conference
on Government has
from a “test tube” experiment to
a state-wide organization in which
over 40 schools are taking an
active part.

These colleges and universities
will send over 300 delegates to
Harrisburg two weeks from today
for the ﬁrst of a three-day session.
At these meetings delegates will
attempt to iron out the difficulties
of the states through ‘a model con-
ference of governors.

Blatt-Bracken Machine

The ﬁ.rst ICG took the form of
a model constitutional convention.
The Blatt-Bracken conference, the
ﬁrst intercollegiate convention to
redraft a constitution of a state,
was so successful that student
delegates created a continuation
committee for the organization and
maintenance of an annual confer-
ence on government. '

Boasting a continued interest of
Pennsylvania students, the ICG
reached the point in April, 1935
where plans for a permanent or-
ganization could be seriously pro-
posed and the adoption of theplan
secured. ' ' ' ‘

At that year’s meeting a consti-

tution was adopted providing for
the preservation of the conference
along’ the lines upon which it had
been launched. The essence of the
ICG was crystallized in its new
constitution stating that its pur-
pose “shall be to foster an inter-
est in governmental problems
among the students in colleges and
universities by dramatizing the
activities of the government in an
unbiased, nonpartisan manner.”

The 1935 conclave founded the
ICG as a’ permanent organization,
with its co-founder, Miss Blatt,
present_ coach of -_Women’s Debat-
ing Association, as its’ executive
director. ’

Model Legislatures

“During the years in "which the
General Assembly holds its regu-
lar sessions, the Intercollegiate
Conference on Government spon-
sors model legislatures,” declares
Miss Blatt. “In the years between
regular legislative meetings, the
conference dramatizes some other
phase of governmental activity
which seems appropriate at the
time. A ‘ _

“Thus, in 1934, a model state
constitutional convention was held.
In 1936, the presidential election
year, a model political convention
was held. And in 1938, a year in
which the necessity for research
into; the ‘no-rnan’s land’ between
state rights is all too apparent, we
are sponsoring a model governor’s
conference. ;

“If someone gave the ICG a
whetstone all mounted in plati-
num, the "organization wouldn’t.
have a bit of use for it. We have
no axes to grind. We’re not inter-
ested in agitation or parties. We
don’t preach or even teach. Our
purpose is to supply a means
whereby students may learn to-
gether how their government
works.” '

Bureau Notes
Business Drop,
Index ecline

According to Dr. Ralph J. Wat-
kins, director of the Bureau of
Business Research, business for the
week ending April 2 lost all gains
recorded in the two preceding
weeks, despite  ’
allowance f or i_
the usual sea‘- , ,§
sonal changes. ‘

Most of the
decline in the
index last week
can be traced to
the sharply re-
duced produc-
tion of coal and
electric power
sales. Depart-._
ment store sales
rose somewhat, _
but less th a n

Dr. V Watkins A
the usual Easter season increase:
Last week the Bureau’s -season-

ally adjusted index of business
stood at 67.0 ,pe_r~c.ent.-.of-the 192.3-.
25 average, a new low in the cur-
rent downswingin business. «The
index, however, was only 2.4
points lower than it was" the first
week of 1938.

Painting Of Swedish  
Room ‘ ears Completion

A
V ,

rOlle Nordniark
To Paint Murals,

I Supervise Work

By E. SEYMOUR KERBER

Final work on the. Swedish
Room was started last week with
the arrival of Ol.le Nordmark,
Swedish fresco painter, who will
‘paint the murals and supervise
the completion of the room.

Mr. Nordmark was born in
Sweden and studied art in Sweden,
Italy, France, and Russia. He
teaches art and has trained many
of the younger American artists,
among them George Biddle and
Reginald March, in the technique“
of fresco and fresco secco painting.

Prior to coming to Pittsburgh,
Mr. Nordmark spent two and one-
half years as technical supervisor
of art work for the Resettlement
Administration. At present he is
connected, in this capacity, with
the U. S. Department of Agricul-
ture. He was in charge of the
painting of the Department of Jus-
tice fresco walls and the murals in
the new Washington, ‘D. C., post-
oﬁice. His largest undertaking
was the painting of a 3000 square
foot fresco in New York.

The ceiling and one wall of the
Swedish Room will be painted in
a fresco secco after‘ the oil tech-
nique of the old Swedish masters.
It is modeled upon a fresco in the
Northern museum in Stockholm.

From a full size drawing on pa-
per, the mural will be painted on

the wall and ceiling.” Mr. Nord-

mark stressed the difference be-
tween a fresco and a fresco secco,
such as being done in the Swedish
Room, The fresco is painted on
wet plaster, and the paint dries in,
while the fresco secco is painted
on a dry plaster surface.

The Swedish Room is to be com-
pleted by the ﬁrst of May, accord-
ing to Mr. Nordmark, in order to
be ready to take part in Pitts-
burgh’s 4 Swedish tercentennary
celebration.

Also as a part of the Swedish
tercentennary celebration will be
a special exhibit of Swedish art at
the Carnegie Institute from April
12 to May 1. This exhibit, con-
taining the works of Sweden’s best
artists,’ was gathered in Sweden
and shipped on "its American tour
by the Swedish government.

By Shorty Long

The

7 Cornerstone

Out of the Spanish conﬂict, there has emerged a
simple faith—“Whoever wins in Spain, a Geddes
cannot lose.” What is a Geddes? Well, your Geddes
is as good as mine. As a matter of fact, :3. Geddes
has taken its stand as a cornerstone of British for-
eign policy. . .

To explain—-—Sir Auckland Campbell Geddes,
P.C., is one of those versatile English peers. He has
been in his time a, medical student at.Edinburgh
University, a professor of anatomy, Principal of

McGill University, a lieutenant in the Highland

Light "Infantry in the South African War, Director
of Recruitingand the Brains of Lord Derby, (who
needed A’em) during the World War.
been British Ambassador to Washington.

But now he has drifted down (yes?) to being

only a company official; just chairman of the Rio
Tinto Mining Company. A, A
-“Kland” ‘Geddes is generally recogAnlzedA-as»--the
largest living example of what a diet of Carlyle in
youthican do fora Scot with a good mind, .:1.. good
presence, and unlimited vitality.
Prankish Smile  __  __
Like Carlyle, the Chairman of Rio Tinto believes
in supermell Aa'ndA their right’ to rule. He also be-

lieves in Auckland Campbell Geddes. To. suppAo_rt-

this latter" point it’.isA only fair to note thatA‘?le leaped
from.‘ . , . .
 17 years.‘ . 5- 

sonage one would say that he is very mirthful. He.

llAas_.-.a jovial, prankish ‘smile that bearﬂﬂ-3 .Wi.A,A.‘h '°Ah.‘A3_A
Asuperman’sA;unlirnited faith in the‘ stupidity "a'"nd fu-' i

tility of mankind. Other points to note’ are a fore-
head like thedome of Allegheny Observatory, :1
chin'like a profile of Edinburgh Rock, and eyes as.
merry as Tom, Sawyer’s. ’ p
A A_Yes, it seems strange that such a superman would
forsake .an official» Government career for a simple
chajirmanshipﬁ He has never looked, I like L0t’s
wife, back at the Foreign office. He doesn’t have
to. He just sends them billet doux; or whatever,
around the corner. A A

For the Rio Tinto is a large corporation produc-
ing Spanish copper and iron ores; Sir Auckland has
let it be known that he does not fear that :1 victory
for General Franco  Spain will tnean the domina-
tion of Spain by either Germany or Italy.

Scientiﬁc Mind . .
- The gist of this modest statement is ".hat.3le be-
lieves Rio Tinto holds the key to Z€‘ranc0’s heart-
He trusts AtAheAlnAsuArgent general would as soonput
his war-time allies behind the eight-ball as bomb
Barcelona. ' ‘ ’ '

As reported in the New York Times, the Geddes A‘

argunjeﬁt is that Spain will be prostrate when the
war ends; that there will be a :1eed :Tor casn, credits
andjmarkets rather than; Italian and German Lech-
 -that London alone can supply aguarantee
ofall three, and that a victorious Franco will not
coyly‘ refuse to look those ﬁscal gift horses in the
mouth. ' . - - i A A

A This, you see, mirrors the scientiﬁc mind of Sir
Auckland. He ~reduces_all ‘things, including Gen-

eral Franco, to a” very’ low common denominator.-

Indeed, his critics maintain that his knowledge of
men is limited by that mind. ~ .;

. Such human traits as foolish enthusiasrns, lxwift
passions, unreasoning fortitudes, and _-wasteful hero-
iéins are notpcalculated by him. Long ago, the old
London Morning Post added up the sco.re"thu-sly:
“Sir Auckland,’.’,it said, “knowseverything about
human anatomy and nothing about _l1l1Xl'13n.l.'1‘aAt'uI‘€z”.’
AA Well, maybe so. , , Anyway .,
still as good as -mine. A

Well it certainly is a sad commentary on the state
of the nation when the head of that great charit-
able, educational, and all-around benevolent insti-
tution Sing Sing takes to turning out such rank

You may not be aware of it but today in America
innocent men are being sent to prison. Yes, it is
unfortunate but true; many an inoffensive pug takes
the rap for things he had nothing to do with.
But don’t let that worryyou.

A In the long run it’s good for them. Why, it keeps
them off street corners and out of fraternity houses.
And after all is said and done and the parole board
sets them loose, they go out into the world honest
upright citizens with a peculiar knack for turning
out license plates or maybe crooning. At least thatjs
what Warden Lawes would have us think and War-
den should know. Hecertainly should. A A

Anyway, togo back Over the Wall, Dick Foran
was just such a. one as I mentioned above,-la good
all-around American boy. »A little hot headed, per-'
haps, but underneath ‘he was solid 14 karat, And
kind! Say, Dickwas‘ so kind he would stand for
hours holding a ﬂashlight so that his grandmother
wouldnot have to shovel coal inthe dark. He was
that kind of guy. A prince. . '

But do you think the bul1s"cou1dA see that. Hell
no. With their customary stupidity the gendarrnes
took this young sprig of humanity and threw him
into ga'ol.~ And there he’ might be languishing unto

this very day had it not been for John Litel, the

John knew what the score was. He saw in "a" "ﬂash
that Dick should be throwing vocal cords instead of
ﬁts. It took some time for him to bring Dick around
but when he did the picture’s troubles were over.

I Jackie Cooper is on the stage. He made a mis-

I know I shouldn’t be telling you this because the

the Penn has a really good picture. A smash hit.
A super colassal laugh-a-minute farce.

A;A;Business Research jBureauA ClaiiAns_ Pittsburgh
Has Firm Grip On Iron, Steel Industries
Editor’s Note: The followingis the ﬁrst of two articles discussing
and explaining the Pittsburgh dist7'ict’s domir-.~allce~~of the iron and
steel industry, based on a study by the University’s Bureau of Business

Research.

Is‘ the Pittsburgh district to lose its dominance in iron and
steel manufacture, the lndustry which has Won for it the title

of "i‘?‘l?l_;’orkshop of the ‘Wo‘1'ld?”
The answer is “No.”

And there are

l‘€ElSOI1S.

Economists of the Bureau of Business Research at the Uni-

versirtyllave studied this vital, much discussed

probAleniA. And

they believe they have found that¢

Pittsburgh and the many indus-
trial cities and townsmof its dis-
trict have a ﬁrm grip on their
chief breadwinner-—iron and steel.

“Coal mines near navigable riv-
ers” is the phrase to. explain the
district’s. dominance.

BLAST FURNACES

There are 37 blast furnaces
producing pig iron——in Allegheny
county; seven in Beaver county;
andtwo each in Westmoreland and
Washington counties. These 48
furnaces represent nearly one-
fourth of the nation’s pig iron pro-
ducing capacity.

The United States Steel corpor-
ation owns 30 furnaces in Alle-
gheny county, and two in Wash-
ington county. Jones and Laugh-
lin ‘Steel corporations owns six in

Professional Ethics Discussed

In ‘Dental Rays’

MONDAY, APRIL 11, 1938

Current Issue

Featuring an editorial discus-'3‘
sion of the niceties of dental
ethics and etiquette, the March
issue of Dental Rays, a quarterly
published by the students and
alumni of the School of Dentistry,
was released recently.

SPECIAL ARTICLES

To clarify the professional
problem of the wandering patient,
Dental Rays ‘points out that “it
has long been an accepted rule of
medical practice that when a pa-
tient presents himself ata physic-
ian’s ofﬁce for treatment, , he is
that physiciaxrs patient”...

Working on thepremise that
“the patient is still free and able
to make a decision as to his choice
of physician,” the article claims
that when a dentist accepts a wan-
dering patient, “without any idea
of injuring the formerA dentist,
(he) is not only ethical but sen-
sible.”

Several articles in the magazine
are written by students in the
school of dentistry. "H. P. Miller;
V. L. Williams; and E. W. Sphar;
discuss “Change in Size of Bac-
teria Due to Fixing and Staining,
and B. H. Neft; S. A. Herron, and
E. A. Nicotra, write on “Bacteria

STUDENT AUTHORS

“Bacteria Found in the Mouths of
Students,” is‘ written by. E. A.
Taano, and W. A. Barrickman,
P. F. Griﬂln, F. C. Meller, and.P;A
E. Martin, Jr., discuss “Germicid-

There was an added bit of
bi'igl1ti1ess in Jimmy Hagan’s
smile the other day whenhe
jlamped his French phone down
on its hook after speaking to
Art Snyder. For Art had just
called to report that his Alco-

ma links were just about in the
physical wel1—bein’g that would be
needed to withstand the divot—di,,-
ging Pitt golf team.

The reason for the extra Hagan
gleam was not so much that Pitt’s
athletic mogul‘ has mellowed into
an adept mashier himself, but

that golf at Pitt was brother Ha-
gan’s particular foster-child.

‘He has nurtured it along from
the days when Sam Parks, Jr.,
as_ a national

who you will recall
open champion
if. you have .a
potent mem-
ory, was the
‘team himself,
throu gh the
days when Re-
zgis Wolff like-
wise acted as
captain, num-
' er one man,
and coach, until
the -immediate
moment, which
brings us to the
p oint where
Pitt is stalking the fairways with
the most select golfing sextets in
the country as a member of the
Eastern Collegiate Conference.

Pitt’s conference companionship
consists of such excellent campus
fairwayers as Cornell, Yale,
Princeton, Dartmouth, Williams,
Georgetown, Pennsylvania, Penn
State, and others of similar cali-
ber. About the only ranking teams
in the nation that are not included
are Michigan and Louisiana State,
and they have been left out only
because of reasons that deal with
geography.

Haven’t Clicked

It is true that in its two years
of matching tee shots with this
group the Panthers have done
very little to bunker the other
members. Last year, just as they‘
were expected to set up a number
of stymies, they narrowly escaped
what could be called a winning
touch.

But" last year there was the
feeling that if the team didn’t
sock its way up among the upper
heirarchy in the league standings,
there was always the season that
loomed one year away for consola-
tion. Because by that time the
best three of the present would
still be around and the undefeat-
ed freshman team would be ready
for varsity play.

Well, that day is now here. But
the days that intervened have
taken a rather drastic toll. In
actual ﬁgures it adds up to three
_golfers that have disappeared from
the contemplated roster.‘

First to go was Fred Nonnen-
berg, state scholastic champion,
who was rightfully regarded as
one of the district’s best golfers.
The beginning of this semester
brought the withdrawal of_ his
Turtle Creek teammate, Adam

Yurigan, who with Nonnenberg.

was responsible for bringing the
state team title to their high school
in the valley.

Junior Frank Bonoratti, Oak-
mont’s contribution to’ Pitt golf,
put aside his books last fall to
record the other casulty in the
Panther ranks.

Two Weak Idlacesl

These depletions still leave the
Pitt team in what may appear to
be a robust condition. This con-
ception comes after a glance at
the upper portions of the line-up
that remain. There are still four
good men around. -

Frank Souchak, number one for
the past two years, will be in there
swinging. During his sophomore
season he only lost one match.
Last season he didn’t fare so well;
He is expected to recapture his
sophomoric tendencies this year.
He will be flanked by endman,
Bill Daddio, and also by Tony
Kay, two good juniors.

The new face in the line-up be‘,-_
longs to smiling Barrett Melvin,
who didn’t play very much golf
last summer, but who ..took the
West Penn Junior and Pennsyl-
vania State "Amateur champion-
ships two years ago. 1 He should
contribute ‘something to the Pitt
point totals.  ‘ . ,, V _ '

SUCCESSFUL VENTURE,

If time permits, the tourney will

Rooker has been .working hard
to put over the tournaments, and
it seems that his efforts ha_ven’t
been wasted. The meet is onesof
the most successful intra—mural
ventures of the seasons Probably
this is because far more boys have

Two-Milc Problcin

By KEN RYDEN, Pitt Hurdler _

Is Coach Carl Olson’s IC4A championship track team as
weak in the long distance" events-as purported by. the lack of
“names.” on his squad list‘? Thisquestionvis directed to those
who have stressed this particular weakness in
scoring of the Pitt spiked squad. _

Admittedly, Harold Tost, red-headed distance star, left a
large opening to be ﬁlled on his graduation last year. _Fresh1nan
records of last‘ year gave no hope for someone to ﬁll his place to

 

 

Solve

reference to the

undergraduate gave evidence of
exceptional ‘ability in the longer
distance runs at the close of last
year’s season. ’ ‘

However‘, recent developments
in the post-indoor ‘training period
‘ have uncovered .a man of potential
ability to ﬁllin the glaring spot of
weakness left by graduation.

One afternoon las't week one of
Coach O1son’s cross-country let-
termen turned in a 10:02 two-
mile run around the tightly
banked indoor track,‘-i a total‘ of
twenty-fourilaps. Cas Kopec, one
of the ‘Kopec brothers of cross-
country fame, was the fellow who
did it.»  V L '

; KOPEC MATURE

According to all logical‘ conclu-
sions Cas should runWw_ell.'_und'e_r,
the 9:50 mark on the easier’ eight-
distance on out--of-door tracks.
This would mean bettering the
University record in this event of
9:49.6 set by Tost over the six-
teen-lap distapce _ on, the Yost
ﬁeldhouse tra‘ck?.,at - the °°University
of Michigan‘."'?..;,u;_,.   

Why draw tliesj'e'.con_clu‘s,ions as
to the ability of a con‘ipar'ably un-
known in distance racing? Primar-
ily because of the fell0Tw.;.'involyed
and the lack of track

For Handicaps Thursday

By BILL MAZEFSKY ' 2 .

Cold weather, andrain have kept the Pitt trac"k squad from

Sixth Annual University Spring Hanclicaps scheduled for next

Thursday, April 14,,in that same Stadium some strenuous
tice sessions are'par.ticularly desirable. I

frosh are ‘jum‘bl-ecdginto the same?

fore him. He is favored with age
and endurance he has shown con-
sistent improvement as he has
learned more ‘about running, and
has run excellent time on a poor
track that cuts stride and builds
muscle fatigue. Because of these
factors, he should improve/to a
p‘oin7t beyond University record
time. i _ ' _ I _j
But what has Coach Olson to
say’ of this. i_An’ amazing state-
ment, to the effect that, although
he expects Cas to run under rec-
ord time, he will not be acredited
with it.‘ Why? Because Pitt’s
home meet‘is with Penn State and
Penn State has two versatile men

in . Pete "Olexy,- a senior, and a I

sophomore, Smith‘, who won the
freshman IC4A cross-country title
last» year. V This’ pair has run the
distance under 9:40.

’ LONGER DISTANCES

However, Mr. Olson is looking
for longer distances for the Erie
boy to run. Mainly the 5,000 and
10,000 metre races, which, as

Coach Olson puts it, “are run in .

the 1940 Olympics.” . N .

Cas is a hard worker, ,putting,
week—ends and
hours in a machine shop at his
toolmaking trade. He has been
out of school only one year since,
he began. He attended Erie Pitt,
before coming here. General
Electric has had him as a night
school pupil in Detroit. An en-
gineer here, he hasiplenty of work
ahead in school, as well as on the,
track this spring.

Plans For Dance

All med and pre-med students
should prick up their ears at the
rumor that some extraordinary
. plans are in the wind for the Chi
Rho Nu dance which comes the
middle of May. This should be of
interest to pre-meds especially be-
cause all members of the medical
school faculty, as well as the pre-
med‘ instructors, ' have been invited.
We could tell you lots more, but
even the committee hasn’t made

up its mind.

Phi Eps Will Dance
At Chatterbox

S p e a k in g of extra-special
dances and things, we think we
have held out on this one long
enough (so do the Phi Eps).

It happens on May 7 that these
boys will invade the Chatterbox
to swing to the tunes of Bill
LeRoy and his Town Tattlers on
the occasion of their Spring
Formal Dinner Dance. That's
all we know about it, but Chair-
man Larry Leyton should be
able to answer all other queries.

Comprehensive inventories of in-

the latest testing devices for to-
day’s college students.

First to institute the examina-

president, Henry M. Wriston, says
that they will attempt to measure
“what students know today rather
than what they have known—
what they have retained and have
available as current resources.”

The tests will also measure
