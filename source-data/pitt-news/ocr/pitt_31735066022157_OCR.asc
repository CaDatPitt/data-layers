Blood bank offers an

incentive for Greeks

The Central Blood Bank is
‘sponsoring a $1,000 prize for the
fraternity that raises the most
pledges for the new blood drive
program Help Increase Pledges
or ”HIP,” according to Craig

‘Jackson co—supervi'sor of public

relations for the IFC.

The fraternities had three hours
on the night of March 21 to call
on the phones supplied by the
blood bank and raise pledges.
They have two more chances on
April 2 and. 10 to increase the
amount of pledges.

”I think one of the main rea-
sons for the new program is that

with all the [surgical] operations

in the area, they just need alot
more blood,” said Jackson.

He went on to say that because
more people are moving out of
Pittsburgh than moving in, the
blood supply has decreased.

”Wev [fraternities] get their
[pledges’] names, addresses and

phone numbers, and all they
have to do is say they'll give
blood within the next year,” said
Jackson. ”The Central Blood
Bank will call them and notify»
them when the next blood drive
is. Whether they give or not is not
the fraternity’s responsibility.”

Pledges are verified by social —

security numbers. -
According to Jackson, the Cen-
tral Blood Bank will need 32,000
more pints next year fromvwhat
they have this year. ”We’ve do-
nated over 1,600 pints of blood
in the previous two blood drives

but we just can.’t do 32,000 pints

ourselves/_’(_ _

Jackson went on to say, ”It’s
not a crisis. situation, they just
want to get the ball rolling before
there is a cri-sis. I’m not sure ifthe
money incentive will always be
there for future blood drives, but

it would be nice to count on it.”

Handicapped kids
enjoy, Hand—in-Hand

By Theresa Costello,
Staff Writer

The sight of a young child on
a college campus is curious in
most cases; this weekend,sev'er—
al hundred were seen wandering
Forbes Quad.

The Ninth Annual Hand-in— *-

Hand festival was held this past

weekend in_ Forbes Quadrangle.’

The festival, which is organized
by ‘Pitt volunteer students,
brought in approximately 300
mentally and physically handi-
capped children from the Pitts-
burgh area.

Lekeena Pryo’r, age 3, said her
favorite part of the program was
getting her picture taken with
some of the clowns.

Her ”buddy,” one of the volun-
teer students, was Nikki
Michalidesga freshman psychol-
ogy major. .

Michalides said that at first
Pryor missed her mother but
within a short «time she was
laughing and having fun. .

Throughout the first and sec-
ond floor of Forbes Quadrangle
were over 30 booths with various
games and prizes for the children.

Eddie Rawson, age 8, accumu-
Iated prizes such as a deputy
badge given by the Allegheny
County Sheriff's Department.

Also present was the the Pirate
Parrot, the Kentucky Fried Chick-
en_ and Gumby. All three were
big hits with the chi_ldren.

”I like bowling best,” said Gary
Lee Beltz, one of this year's par-
ticipants, as he happily remem-
bered his strike.

The day was not only enjoya-
ble for the childrenbut for the
student volunteers as well.

”I just thought it was a good
opportunity to help these kids,"
said Shawn Danday, a sophmore
political science major. “I know
that they look foward to this day
all year, so what is one day out
of my year?”

Michalides said, ”I was really
interested in this [the festival]. I'm

' thinking about going into psy-

chology -.maybe child psychol-
ogy, so I thought. this would be
good experience, too.”
Actitvities for the children in-
cluded more than the game

‘booths. Various acts kept some of

the children entertained for the
afternoon._ Skits included puppet
acts, which were both entertain-

_ing and educational. /'

Sign language was used ‘to
communicate to the deaf chil-

_dren. One of the most popular

events was a performance of the
Wham song, ”Wake Me Up Be-

' Joseph Heller, author of the
‘classic’ book Catch-22, spoke
about his writings and ex-
periences Saturday at the Tenth
Annual University of Pittsburgh
Writers’ Conference. I I
Heller, the keynote speaker of
the conference, told the_more
than 700 people who filled the
Assembly Room of the William
Pitt Union that he madea discov-
ery while still" in elementary
schooL ‘

’’I found out that in this coun—.

try anybody can- become a
writer,” Heller said. ”All you
need is, a typewriter and some
papen” '

Heller explained that after he"

submitted a story for publication
he madela second discovery: not
everybody who wants to be a
writer can become a published
writer.

Heller said that it was not until
college, after World War II, that
he finally became a published
writer.

’.’In college, I took a class in fic-
tion writing.  Everything I wrote

I submitted for publication to ev--

Heller remembered ”The New
Yorker gives such swift re-
jections.”

But Heller said that he did get
two handwritten rejections from
Esquire and The Atlantic Month-
ly saying they liked what he
wrote but suggested revisions.

‘fl had [three] more stories pub-
Iished,” Heller said. ’’I became a

not comfortably live on that sa-
lary. He said he then decided to‘
go to graduate school.

Heller told his audience that

while attending graduate school I t ,
at Columbia, he decided to write 7 '  "
a novel. He proceeded to write x 
thefirst few chapters of what was ~‘
to become Catch-22 while work-I _

ing at an advertising agency. J
Heller said he then‘ spent the

next two and a half years work

ing on Catch-22. ‘ . ' ,
But writing the book seemed to

be an easier task than getting it‘

published. ’’I took it to eight or

nine publishers.” , ‘

’ Robert Gotlieb, of Simon and M

Baker tries to round up Reagan cronies for talks

WASHINGTON —— White
House Chief of Staff Howard Bak-
er, long distrusted by the conser-
vative wing of the GOP, is trying
to calm its members by organiz-
ing a small group of President
Reagan's |ong—time associates to
meet regularly with the president

‘to press the conservatives’

agenda.

Baker, the former majority
leader in the Senate, is viewed
with deep suspicion by many in
the right wing, who see him as a
Capitol Hill compromiser, eager
to get Reagan to approve higher
taxes, slacken support for the
Nicaraguan rebels or even sign
an arms control agreement with
the Soviets, just to shift the focus
from the disarray caused by the
Iran-Contra affair.

Kenneth Cribb, a conservative
activist who has been detailed to

Baker's White House transition»

team, said it was Baker's idea to
bring together, a group of ”the
president's oldest and closest as-
sociates.”

Couple released after
triangle affair arrests

PITTSBURGH — A West-
moreland County couple are free
on bond after being charged in
connection with an alleged love
triangle with their 16-year-old
foster daughter.

Joseph and Rhonda Kubiac of
New Kensington were released
on $5,000 bond each after a
hearing before Districtlustice Art
Sabulsky last week. Both were
charged with criminal conspira-
cy and corruption of minors.

Mrs. Kubiac also was charged
with indecent assault, aggravated
assault and criminal attempt at
aggravated assault. The latter two
charges stem from an incident in
which she allegedly -pointed a
knife to the girl's stomach and
threatened to kill her, police said.

Kubiac was not charged with
indecent assault because the girl.
told police she willingly had sex
with him when they were alone,
said Allegheny County Official
Bob Downey.

A nuclear world

is adeadlyworld

In recent news from the arms control front, British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher is in Moscow to meet with Mik-
hail Gorbachev. The proposed topics of discussion are to in-
clude the possible elimination of medium-range missiles in
Western Europe. ‘ -

In a live interview before the trip, Thatcher claimed that she

. was not willing to discuss the British arsenal of nuclear weapons

as part of a LI.S.-Soviet arms agreement. That sentiment was

- echoed by French Prime Ministerjacques Chirac, in a discus-

sion of his aims in an upcoming meeting with Reagan.

The-.central.issue seems to be that the Soviets are not willing

 to.ir'icIude their short-"range nuclear weapons without some sort *-
‘ of agreement from the British and the French. The concerns’

of the Europeans are understandable; their lands have been deci-
mated twice in the Iast.70 years. They surely have reason to

fear a powerful neighbor.

As the world arsenal of nuclear weapons increases, though,

.there,can only be an increasing chance that a nuclear weapon

will come to the hands of a special interest political group, a
group without the restraint of a large constituency.

To eliminate the threat of such a group controlling a nuclear

“ arsenal, the aim of the superpowers, on both sides of the idea-
logical line, must be one of total disarmament.

I We, as voters,-have the right and responsibility of choosing
thoserepresentatives who will stand for nothing short of total
freedom from the nuclear-specter that has so long shaded our

BAS elections

leave some doubt

In the midst of the confusion surrounding its elections, the

4' Black Action Society is to be commended for its attempts to

rectify the situation. However, the situation seems to have gener-

I I. ated an attitude among BAS members regarding the general pub-

Iic as adversaries. -

For example, in interviews relating to -Friday's story about

I thegelections, members of the BAS refused to discuss even
~ whether a meeting held on Thursday involved the Steering Com-

mittee or the Elections Committee. Because of the apparent per-
ception of the public as an adversary, it seems that all facts are

I being closely guarded — lest certain information fall into the
wrong hands.

in The BAS has apparently already decided to repeat the elec-

tions on April 2, according to ‘an advertisment in this newspaper
to that effect. Yet in a statement on Thursday,,a spokesman said
an official decision would not be reached until today. Why the

9"" it secrecy and contradictions?

I * ’ We encourage the BAS to be more open about the situation
' and not to view the public as an adversary. If they had reached

a decision to repeat the elections, why not say so? Such secre-
cy' about the situation could lead people to believe that there

. is more involved inthe confusionthan a simple mistake. Open-

ness about the elections can only expedite a‘ sovlutioln.’

0 What is Coke? We're told

‘ that Coke is it, but what is it? Is

it the universal it? Have the

0 People ask for a very. dry mar-
tini, but they still ‘get upset when
it spills on them. If it's dry, why
does it matter?

dealt with The Pitt News on a

sum of these experiences [that] I
write this letter. The Student
Government Board and The Pitt

paranoia and extreme vigilance
surrounding their interactions.

The Pitt News, Monday, March 30, 1937

Vanity is running rampant

Mirror, mirror, on the wall,

\ who's the fairest of them all?

Though futile, the search for
everlasting beauty will always be
a reality as long as there are wom-
en and men who feel they're only
as good as they look.

We have fostered and nurtured
those whom we consider to pos-
sess beauty extraordinaire -— in
fact, we reward it.

Ponce de Leon never really
found a fountain of youth.
But modern-day miracle scaven-
gers are still out there, still trying

to find the secret for eternal youth I

and beauty.

If you read the Sunday Press,
you saw the article on the front
page about a new facial treatment
that promises to reduce scars and
wrinkles. I'm cringing right now
(probably increasing my chances

of developing premature wrin— _

kles), thinking about the number
of people who will call the paper
or the doctors mentioned in the
article to find out more about the
treatment.

Though those who received the
treatment call the results ”fantas-
tic,” I believe‘| would have to see
for myself. We've all seen. those
before/after pictures in magazines
and newspapers for ads promot-
ing weight-loss products and goo-
ey things to make you look years
younger. You know + those
untouched-retouched-touched-
up photos that look like they've
been magneted to somebody’s
refrigerator for 10 years.

-‘What ever happened to aging
gracefully? I would consider
wrinkles a physical mark that
deserves respect, unless they are
those caused by excessive sun-
bathing. Now that we are all
aware of the dangers caused by

     

3 A  '  V

overexposure to the sun, there is
_ no excuse for developing any of

its consequent diseases. Buy
now, pay later.

Wrinkles, physiologically
speaking, are caused by things
like stress, too much smiling, and
the eventual loss of elasticity of
the skin. ' T

Wrinkles are — more than a
sign of aging — a sign of life.
Time is our greatest enemy; fight-
ing a clock with a scalpel is like
fighting off a nuclear warhead
with a water gun.

Everyone has heard the cliche
purporting inner beauty as the ul-
timate means to happiness. And
hackneyed though it may be, ac-
cepting it as fact is something
people find difficult to do.

I've always heard beauty is
only skin deep, but hey? —
Who's fooling whom?

There are times when I wish I
had blue eyes and when I wish
my nose wouldn't turn up just so
much. (Don't be fooled bythe
picture of me you see. It makes
my nose look like Al Pacino or
something that ate Manhattan. In

Greene ain't no god

It was the finest of weekends.

It's not often one is able to
spend time with a personal hero,
and I was able to do that for a
short while this weekend.

I was assigned to pick up Bob
Greene, Joseph Heller and Ish-
mael Reed as each arrived at
Pittsburgh International Airport
for their appearance at the
Writers’ Conference. '

Given that I have worshipped
Bob Greene much in the same
way many follow Bruce Spring-
steen, I was much more excited
about meeting him than Heller.

I got upearly and went out to
the airport Friday to wait for
Greene. Heller wouldn't be in till
Saturday, and I was to pick him
and Ishmael Reed up when
Greene went back for his flight
home.

. Greene's flight on United
Airlines from Chicago was an
hour late, but I waited. patiently
—— reading a mediocre book by
Garrison Keillor and looking up
for the plane that carried a man
I knew only by words. (By the
way, the person who designed
airport lounge chairs should be
strapped to one that is mounted
on the wing of a, 747 just before
the jet takes off for Cleveland.
Upon arrival there, he should be
shot.) I

longer impressed by what I
thought was the man behind it.

He's basically a shy person,
and that must have something to
do with it — but it bothered me
that all he ever wanted to talk
about was himself. As first i_m-
pressions go, Bob Greene was —
forgive me — a jerk.

Joseph Heller, on the other
hand, was one of the more amia-
ble people I have ever met. He
talked in spurts, used a wry wit,
and he jumped from topic to
topic; different observations
came to him on his thirdvisit to
the city.

His questions and comments
continued to flow as we got in a
silver Chevy Caprice loaned from
_the university car pool.

”Is this your car, or is it from
the college?” he asked.

L ”It’s the college's,’’ I said, con-
sidering whether or not I should
tell him Pitt was a university and

not a mere college. I'm glad I_

didn't say anything.
”Your college is either rich or
pretentious,” he said.‘ I ~

The only strange thing about

Heller was the fact that he carried

only-at small silver book bag. He
g had no luggage, and yet Ijcouldg A

fact, I don't think that picture
looks like me at all — but that's
another story. At least I don't look

like a demon — check out Mat- ,

thew Thornton's picture.)

I suppose it is only natural to
want to look better. Almost every-
one does. But that is only be-
cause we made it that way.

However, fooling oneself into
believing that true happiness can
only be achieved by erasing wrin-
kles is pathetic.

I remember a story I read when
I was little. It was about a girl who
had terrible luck attracting the
guys at school. She went shop-
ping and saw the biggest hair
bow imaginable._ She thought it
was beautiful, and the salesper-
son told her she would be sure to

’ get a date if she wore the bow.

That night, she fastened the
bow to her hair, and went -—
where else? — to the soda shop.
She encountered a young boy on
whom she had a crush but never
thought she could get a date with
before. Unbeknownst to her, the
bow had fallen out of her hair.
But she asked the boy, she got the
date, and the rest, well, the rest
is history. '

”Paint a perfect picture. Bring
to life a vision in one’s mind. The
beautiful ones always smash the
picture, always. Every time.”
Words of wisdom from Prince.
And he even hangs with a chick
named Vanity.

And so, too, with time, beauty’ i

shall fade away. Smile all you
want, and be grateful as long as
you have something to smile

his hotel later he was wearing a
change of clothes.

The weekend was both uplift-

ing and disappointing. Just as I'

thought Greene had quelled my

’ ideas about successful writers be-

ing all-around good guys, Heller
came along and, at least tem-
porarily, resurrected them. _

I interviewed Greene two
weeks ago for a story which ap-
peared in the Writers’ Confer-
ence guide we printed. By the
time he went to the podium to
speak at 9 pm." Friday, he had al-
‘ready either told me or written

everything he told the audience ‘

in his presentation. There was
nothing spontaneous about the
man ‘during the time he. was here.

So what do I do now? Drop

Greene and pick up everything

Heller does?

I don't think so because it prob-
ably wasn't too bright to think so
much of a person I didn't know.
He's not going to remember me,
though he might remember our
news editor -~ only because she
is an attractive blonde — he never
really talked to her either.

If I wanted to worship Heller,
he'd probably call or write me

and say I should get a job or

something.

There were times when I want-
ed to be justlike Bob Greene.
That feeling is gone now,-—— and
I. really don't mind at_all.

The Graceland Express added a postscript. It said that Spring- '_ _

”Fol|ow that Dream.” ’ A ' » ‘I L
I don't know why I like that anecdote so much. The thing i
that hits me the hardest is the part where Springsteen is telling '

I hope we're all over that
Bruce Springsteen nastiness
that erupted when I men-
tioned, several months ago,
that I didn't understand his
appeal. I‘ have a Bruce
Springsteen story to tell to-
day, and I don't want it to
be flavored by that column.

  

The newest issue of the
Graceland Express has just
come out. The Graceland
Express is a publication that
is produced by the estate of
Elvis Presley, and I sub- .
scribe to it. A-nyway, there's an -article about Springsteen in‘ it.

The article begins with a preface by the editors of the
Graceland Express: '

”Over the 20 years that Elvis lived at Graceland, the securi-

'4

ty staff enjoyed a friendly and usually well-controlled relation- '

ship with the fans and curiosity-seekers who gathered atthe
Graceland gates night and day. Once in a while, though, some-
one would get brave, jump over the fence and head for the
house’. The guards sometimes had to pull people off the hood

of_Elvis’ car, coax them down from trees, and chase them all .

over the grounds. One night in 1975, a singer on the threshold
of superstardom made a stop at Graceland in hope of ha-ving

an audience with his idol. The singer was Bruce Springsteen, ’

and here, in his own words, is the story he often tells in
concert.” I I
What follows is Springsteen's narration, apparently tape
recorded from one of his concert appearances: 
”Back in '75, on the Born to Run tour — a little. bit of history

for you  we were down in Memphis, and I remember it was r
late at night, and I was sittin’ in a motel room and my guitar _

player, Steve. We got a taxi to.take us out to Elvis’ house.
”And it took us out there in the middle of the night, and‘l

rememeber we got outta the cab, and we stood there in front

of those gates with the big guitar players on ’em. And when

I we looked up the driveway, in the second story of_ the house,'.. - " 
you could see a light on, and I figured Elvis has gotta-be up

readin’ or somethin’. And I told Steve, I said, ’Steve, man‘, I gotta

go check it out.’ And I jumped over the wall, and I started run-_

nin’ up the driveway, which when I look back on it now was
a kind of stupid thing to do, because I hate it when people do
it at my house. V -~

”Anyway, at the time, I was filled with the enthusiasm of

youth and ran up the driveway, and I got to the front door, and '
I was just about to knock, and the guards came out of the woods _ , »

and asked me what I wanted. And Isaid, ‘Is Elvis home?’ Then
they said, ‘No, no, Elvis isn't home, he's in Lake Tahoe.’
”So, I started to tell ’em that I was a guitar player and that
I had my own band, and that we played in town that night, and
that I made some records. And I even told ’em I had my pic-

ture on the cover of Time and Newsweek. I had to pull out all
‘the stops to try to make an impression, you know. I don't think

he believed me, though, ’cause he just kinda stood there nod-

din’  and then he took me by the arm and put me back on

the street with Steve. V
”Later on, I ‘used, to wonder what I would have said if I'd

knocked on the door and Elvis had come to the door, because _ 
it wasn't really Elvisl was goin’ to see. But, it was like he _came 
along and whispered some dream in everybody’s ear, and some- ' ’ '

how we all dreamed it. And maybe that's why we're here

the Graceland security guards that he has his pictures‘ on the

covers of Time and Newsweek. I had always heard that Spring- _  
steen was a littleembarrassed by the simultaneous magazine , 5;’

covers, and didn't like it when people brought up the subject.
But apparently being at. Graceland was so important to him
that he felt he had to use the magazine covers as ammunition

with the security guards. I'm sure the guards didn't believe him; . is  

here's some guy trying to sneak up to the front door, and he's
saying that he's been on the covers of Time and Newsweek.

_ Sometimes people ask me why I think that Elvis was such an '. ' 
important force in so many |ives.I like the way that Springsteen. _ I  3'

said it:

”... It wasn't really Elvis I was goin’ to see. But, it was like V
he came along and wispered some dream in everybody’s ear, '

and somehow _we all dreamed it.” -

DeSiIIers’ condition still critical

PITTSBURGH (AP) ~ A
7-year-old liver transplant pa-
tient who received national at-
tention when donations from
his classmates were stolen was
on a respirator Sunday while
awaiting a second liver
transplant.

' Ronnie DeSillers'of Miami
was in critical condition for
the second straight day at Chil-
dren’s Hospital of Pittsburgh,
a hospital spokeswoman said.

’’It’s rough seeing him like

that. He can't move,” his

mother, Maria DeSillers, 31,
said Sunday evening from the
hospital. ’’It tears my heart, it
really does.”

Ronnie had been in critical
but stable condition since
March 22, when he was

- moved into the intensive care

unit to await a second donor’
liver because of a virus that

damaged the liver he received

Feb. 24.

The viral infection later
spread to his lungs and has not
abated, hospital spokeswom-

an Lynn McMahon said.

He was placed on the respi-
rator early Saturday because of
the lung infection, Ms.VMcMa-
hon said.

Ronnie's case received na-
tional attention after $4,000
was stolen from his class-

vmates’ medical fund at his
school in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
A nationwide outpouring of
donations followed, including
a $1,000 check from President
Reagan, with the total eventu-
ally passing $400,000.

Deaf woman sues for

right to sit on jury

By Bob Dvorchak

Associated Press Writer

ROARING SPRlN.G, Pa. —
JoAnn DeLong is not among

those who scramble to get out of ’

jury duty.

DeLong, a deaf assembly-line
worker, has sued in federal court
to be put back in a jury pool af-
ter a Blair County judge barred
her from serving in a civil .case

Heller

Continued from page 1

Eventually, the book sold 2 mil-
lion copies. Heller said that he
then decided to work on other
books.

His next novels include Some-
thing Happened and As Good As
Cold. Both novels were a hit with
‘readers.

Heller's next novel, God
Knows, was interrupted by a
paralyzing illness. Heller told the
audience that one day in 1981 he
hadtrouble swallowing. He be-
came worried when he tried to
cross his legs and couldn't. He
ssaid he wore tube socks because
he didn't have the strength to
separate stretch socks.

”I called my doctor, and he
said ’It sounds like Gullain-
Barre,’ ” "Heller said.

While recovering in the hospi-
tal, Heller fell inllove with his
nurse, who he intendes to marry
this summer. K,’

His first non—fictib’ﬁ book, No
Laughing Matter, co-written with
Speed Vogel, documents Heller's
illness and recovery.

The audience's reaction to
Heller was enthusiastic. Listeners

readings from his books.

Pat Patterson, an audience
member, said that she liked hear-
ing about Catch—22. ’’I had to
read it when l was in college 20
years ago. It- was great-hearing
him in person —— hearing the up-
dates on the new novels.”

Frank Rowe, another member.

of the audience, said that the
speech was inspirational to him.
”Joe Heller has demonstrated
great strength and indeed hero-
in coming back from
Guillain-Barre syndrome.”

Lee Gutkind, founder of the
University of Pittsburgh Writers’

Conference, said that he was -

pleased with the turnout. ”We’ve
probably had twice as many peo-
ple through here this time than
ever before, and all of our other
conferences were well-

. attended." -

Gutkind said that he was look-
ing forward to next year. ”This
[the Writers’ Conference] is one
of those things where you never
know if there will be a next year,

"but I hope there is.”

’’I felt [that] it like a slap in the
face. I didn't feel like an Ameri-
can citizen anymore,” DeLong
said. ”Where’s the equal rights?
I pay taxes like everyone else. I
want to be treated as a regular
citizen.”

Ironically, a different judge in

ed Allen Hammel, a deaf postal
worker who was assisted by an
interpreter using sign language
during a two-day assault trial.

Other jurors were impressed
with the way he picked up on nu-
ances and detail of testimony.

ing on. He was able to notice
things. We noticed inflections in
voice, and he was able to use his
senses to the best of his abilities,”
Josette Shiffler of Altoona, who
headed the jury.

The deaf and their advocates
list such examples to support
their point that American justice
can be deaf aswell as blind.

The deaf are permitted by law
to serve on juries in California,
Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois

PTL spokesman critical of Hahn's ’Iewd’behavior

By Robert Barr

Associated Press Writer

Jim Bakker’s congregation
prayed Sunday for the evangelist
who was brought down by a
night of adultery, while the wom-
an in the affair was admonished
by her adviser to wear quieter
clothes and ”shut up.” '

Paul Roper, the se|f—appointed
Pentecostal watchdog who
negotiated a $265,000 settlement
with Bakker’s PTL ministry, criti-
cized 27-year-old Jessica Hahn
for ”walking around in skin-tight
jeans in her back yard saying cute

little throwaway remarks to the .
press.” '

’’I have told her inwriting and
on the telephone to either shut up
and say nothing, or else tell her
whole story to a church tribunal,”
Roper was quoted as saying in
Sunday's editions of Newsday,
the Long Island newspaper.

Roper said he believes the As-
semblies of God, the denomina-
tion to which he and Bakker
belong, would convene such a
hearing.

In Fort Mill, S.C., the Rev.
Richard Dortch told 2,300 peo-
ple who filled Bakker’s Heritage
Village-Church that ”We’re on
the road to victory.

side,” said Dortch, who offered
a prayer for Bakker and his wife
Tammy.

Hahn has mostly stayed inside
her West Babylon, N.Y., apart-
ment since she was identified as
the woman whose night with
Bakker led to his resignation from
the PTL ministry. She has refused
most requests for interviews but
has stepped outside occasional-
ly to be photographed.

’’I believe her story. But I'm
violently opposed to trying any-
body without hearing all the ver-
sions,” said Roper, an ‘Anaheim,
Calif., businessman who met
with several reporters last week
to give Hahn's version.

PTL gauges

By Tamara Jones
Associated Press Writer

FORT MILL, s.c. — The toy
store at Heritage USA sells plas-
tic whales and grinning Jonah
dolls. -

At the village's fast-food joint,
a pizza is named after the pastor.

The grounds boast a $10 mil-
lion water slide, a carousel, a
miniature golf course, a roller
rink, a miniature train and other
amusements.

The Rev. Jim Bakker used to
call children ' ”the church of
tomorrow,” and growing up in

_ his evangelical enclave was sup-

posed to be a happy, wholesome
and holy experience. I
Then came what members of

Bakker’s PTL ministry have come"

to call simply ”the trouble.”
First came the admission that
Bakker’s wife and popular co-
pastor, Tammy Faye, was depen-
dent on prescription drugs.
Then Bakker confessed he had

_Bakker and Dortch both offered
their resignations to the denomi-
nation on March 19, the day Bak-
ker announced his resignation
from PTL. Bakker asked the Rev.
Jerry Falwell, a Baptist, to step in
as chairman of the PTL board to
prevent what Bakker called a
hostile takeover.

Bakker’s attorney later accused
Louisiana evangelistjimmy Swag-
gart of attempting a takeover, a
charge that Swaggart denied.

Dortch, who is now president
of PTL, has been asked to meet

with the North Carolina District

Council of the Assemblies of God
this week to discuss his resigna-
tion, which was not immediate-

ly accepted.

Roper has said that Dortch met '

with him to negotiate a $265,000
settlement for Hahn, which in-
cluded a $150,000 trust fund.
Roper has said the agreement
called for her to keep silent about
her liaison with Bakker in 1980.

Bakker has called that money
’’blackmail,’’ and Falwell has said
it has the appearance of ex-
tortion. ,

’’If that's the case, I would
predict he will be gone in the
near future,” said the Rev. Robert
Dugan, president of the Nation-
al Association of Evangelicals,
who appeared Sunday on ABC's
This Week with David Brinkley.

scandal’s effect on kids

committed adultery. He resigned,
claiming he was being black-
mailed by people with designs on
his -video pulpit.

Mudslinging among television
evangelists ensued. .

It was in this atmosphere that
the Rev. Dave Winchellwalked
into Heritage’s weekly children's
service and asked the grade-
school congregation to raise their
hands if they knew that ”some—
thing serious had happened at
PTL."

”Every hand was raised,” Win-
chell said, .”and there were
maybe 110, 115 kids there.”

How to explain ”the trouble”
has become a sensitive and emo-
tionally charged issue for PTL’s
ministers, parents and teachers.

’’It has affected kids,” said
Mark Muirh_ead, the minister in
charge of PTL’s teen—age and
young adult members.

”There is grief, disappoint-

ment, confusion and misunder-
standing,” he said.

'”We did not want to deny the

mistake ofJim Bakker or the mag-

nitude of it. We tried to discover
what lessons we can learn.”
Muirhead was peppered with
questions at a PTL teen fellow-
ship meeting. Mostly, he said, the
youngsters wanted to know why

Bakker did it, what would hap—-

pen to the ministry and when the
Bakkers would come back.
”There’s a lot of closeness now
because everybody’s kind of
banding together to make it over
the hill,” said Nelson White, a
13-year-old PTL member who

, has lived at Heritage for a year

and attends the village's private
school.

Dave Winchell didn't discuss
Bakker’s sexual dalliance with
the younger children but said he
broached the subject of Mrs. Bak-
ker’s, problem by ’’explaining the
difference between drug depen-
dency and drug abuse.”

who can't understand speech, the
NAD said.

”There’s no real reason why
the deaf can't sit on juries. As
citizens, we have a right. The law
is due for social reform,” said
Muriel Strassler, spokeswoman
for the NAD. ”We just want to be
the same as everybody else.”

Arguments against the deaf
serving on juries are that the in-

- terpreters could distract other

jurors because they must be in
the line of sight of the witness and
the jury. Others question the
presence ofthe interpreter in the
jury room, and some wonder if
the deaf can sense subtle nervous
tones‘ in the voice of a witness.

”Their eye senses are very spe-
cial. They can pick up things
other people can't, like body lan-

guage, the crossing of legs, ner-'
. vous glances. Every person who

loses one sense picks up other
things. They see things we miss,”
said interpreter Stan Swope.
”The big fear always was a deaf
juror would miss something in
testimony. They don't miss any-
thing. They have access to the
same material,” said Mark Shar-
matz, attorney for the NAD.
’’I’m a firm believer that the
deaf serve as well as anybody
else,” Sharmatz said. ”When you

' get called and can't serve, the

judge is saying: ’You’re deaf.
Therefore, leave.’ That's insulting
to some people. You don't want

to be shunted aside.”

DeLong, 47, had hearing until
the age of 7 when an illness af-
fected her nervous system. She
was rejected as a juror on Oct. 6
byjudge Bruce Brunbaugh before
she was questioned by attorneys.

Brunbaugh did not return
phone calls. At the time, he cit-
ed a Pennsylvania case in which
a convict received a new trial af-
ter it was learned one of the
juror's hearing was impaired.

Mrs. DeLong sued in federal
court in February that her rejec-
tion violated her constitutional
rights and a federal act that bans
discrimination against the han-
dicapped. ‘

”She’s a fighter. A lot of peo-
ple would have been upset and
forgot about it. She's not like that.
She's willing‘ to take a stand,”
said her attorney, Robert Lape of
Roaring Spring. ,

”She was very capable of per-
forming her duty. She wasn't
given a chance because of some-
thing she couldn't control,” Lape
said.

Meanwhile, Blair County Presi-

‘ dent Judge Thomas G. Peoples Jr.

allowed Allen Hammel to sit on
a jury.

”What confuses me is that the
law is supposed to be the same
for everybody, but here we have
two judges giving two different
opinions in the same county,”
Hammel, who was born deaf,
said through an interpreter.

A recent survey of. I00 Pitt
students showed that one of
the major problems hindering
academic performance is
procrastination.

Procrastination is the act of
putting off doing something,
especially unpleasant or bur-
densome activities.

According to Dr. Tom.
Schlesinger, Pitt Counseling
Center psychologist, students
procrastinate for a variety of
reasons. I

Some contributing factors

failure, lack of time-
management skill, peer pres-

sures to socialize and lack of

might include laziness, fear of 

long-term goals or direction.
Many professionals argue
that procrastination does not
reflect an unwillingness to-
work but rather just the
avoidance of the one specific
task that has to be done first.
Students surveyed readily
admitted to neglecting their
academic duties, but few
could offer explanations. ‘
”Every term I pay a late fee
because I wait too long to
make an advising appoint-
ment,” senior statistics major
Joe Spadafore said. ”I don't -
know why I do it because I
really can't afford the luxury."
As a direct result of poor
study habits, some instructors
are continually being ad-
dressed by students trying to

make up for lost time.

”No one group of students
seems to corner the market on
late homework, but I have no-
ticed a positive relationship
between speech giving days
and dead grandparents,” said ‘
Asli Gokhan, a Public Speak-
ing instructor. _

“ ”Students should set short-
term and realistic goals each
week if they are having
problems completing their
work on time,” suggested
Gokhan.

Contributor thought North controlled Contra money

By Rita Beamish

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON —— At least one
wealthy contributor who gave
money to a private Contra aid ef-
fort believed Lt. Col. Oliver

North, then a White House aide, '

was controlling how the funds
were spent, documents show.
A note from the contributor to
an employee of conservative
fund—raiser Carl ”Spitz” Channell
included a $100,000 check and
said, ”Please have Ollie contact
me to let me know what he's go-.
ing to do with it.” »
The note, dated May 27, 1986,
was among documents obtained
from Channell’s offices by Jane
McLaughlin, who worked as a

fund—raiser for Channell.

The documents, which Miss
McLaughlin has turned over to
the independent counsel inves-

Ii

tigating the lran-Contra affair,
were reviewed by The Associat-
ed Press. They indicate a more
active role by North in Channell’s
operation than previously ac-
knowledged by Channell, whose
activities are under scrutiny by
the independent counsel.

Miss McLaughlin would not

' comment about the documents.

Channell has maintained that
North did not raise or control
money for his operations, which
included a $1 million pro-Contra
TV campaign, a Contra speakers
program and humanitarian aid
contributions estimated at $3 mil-
lion throughout the two-year con-

gressional ban on U.S. military_

aid to the Contra -rebels in
Nicaragua.

Roots author criticizes racial situation

ERIE, Pa. (AP) — Author Alex
Haley says the Reagan adminis-
tration is undermining the
progress blacks and other minori-
ties have made since his Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel, Roots, was
published 10 years ago.

”This administration is working
hard to dilute, to weaken, to hold
in place, all minorities, not just
blacks,” Haley said Saturday at a
press conference at the Pennsyl-

vania State University at Erie, the

Behrend College. ”This is an

’’I wouldn't say as a nation that

that there is an attitude problem

that it raised the level of cans-

Greene's beat takes him from Nixon to the Alamo

By J.A. Reese
For The Pitt News ,

The profession of journalism
can often make for some un-
predictable moments. Bob
Greene, columnist for the Chica-
go Tribune, took everyoneby sur-
prise Friday when he opened the
Tenth Annual Writers’ Confer-
ence —— not with the planned

Playwright and producer

By‘ Tracy Yossa
For The Pitt News

Saturday at the Pittsburgh Pub-
lic Theater, an enthusiastic au-
dience had the .opportunity to
witness the love-hate relationship
between the playwright and his
producer. '

‘William T. Gardner, producing

S director of the Pittsburgh Public

Theater, shared the stage with
award-winning playwright Arthur
Giron, director of the playwriting

jprogram at Carnegie Mellon
_ University. The two spoke about

problems the playwright and the
producer encounter when work-
ing to stage a play.

day and Friday in The Pitt News,
said that writing has given him
the opportunity to see America.

However, Greene said there is
really nothing genuine in
America.

"The Alamo was the only thing
real, so I flew to San Antonio. I
knew [that] I had to get to_the Ala-
mo and would need transporta-
tion. I asked the desk clerk where

‘ it [the Alamo] was and how far

away it was from the hotel. He

. said it was down one block right

across the street from Wool-
worth's, and in front of the Alamo
is a USA Today box. In the back

As one member of the au-
dience pointed out, the public
generally believes that a
playwright finishes a work then
finds a producer to back him. The
two hire actors and a director,
then, after a few months of re-
hearsal, comes opening night.

According to Giron, this is not
true. "Only about 30 percent of
having a play produced cons_ists
of the brighter aspects people as-
sociate with being a playwright,
such as finishing a play then sub-
mitting it to a producer to be
staged,” he said.

Giron added, ”For all its
wonder, the life of a playwright

was Charles Long, the manager,
with a digital clock and a cord-
less telephone. I went back to the
Hyatt Regency and left the next
day," said Greene.

Greene also talked about his
experience interviewing Richard
Nixon — he asked Nixon if he
minded being tape recorded for
the interview. This was after the
Watergate scandal.

"He looked at me, and I looked
back, and the interview just start-
ed,” said Greene.

Greene said he does not write
for his audience but for himself.

is 70 percent full of issues that
must be taken care of after the in-
itial work is finished.”

Consultation with the producer_

. and perhaps numerous rewrites

Arthur Giron

are just a few of the issues that
must be dealt with following the
completion of the play. ,

If the life of a playwright is lack-
ing in glamour, the duties of a

producer can be just as dreary. ‘

"|t's 20 percent artistic and 80
percent funds,” Gardner said.
"But Iaccept that it [fundraising]
has to be done. The plays won't
go on without the funds."

However, the artistic aspect‘ of _

producing isn"t less taxing. Gard-

"When I write in my room at
my word processor, I like to think
of writing myself a letter. I make
it as good as I can for myself, then

it's just as good for anyone else. '

"If something isn't interesting,
I don't write the story. I never
write a story because the editors
tell me what should be written,"
said Greene.

Although Greene has accom-
plished so much, he said that he
does not consider himselfto be
out of_ the ordinary.

"I'm not sure I'm special. I
think of myself as a pretty good
reporter who works hard and
with some luck," said Greene.

ner.not only has to choose the
plays the Public Theater will
stage, he also reads the work of
playwrights and discusses with
him or her what mustbe rewrit-
ten before the play will be
produced.

' "That's when I have to separate
my personal feelings from my
feelings ' as a producer,” said
Gardner. . -

"I have to think like an au-
dience,” Gardner continued. "I
have to choose six plays [per sea-
son] to appeal to 20,000 people.”

Giron and Gardner are current-
ly preparing one of Giron's plays,
Scout's Honor, for production
next season at the Public Theater.

Mulroony urges aci rain control talks with U.S.

By Bill Schulz

Associated Press Writer

QUEBEC — Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney must

I .,_publicly tell President Reagan

S I ~ ‘Saturday.

‘next month that his country-
wants acid rain cleaned up, a
-Minnesota congressman said

"If there are going to be acid
rain controls, they're going to be
legislated by Congress," said
Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D—Minn.,

7-4 . author of the most widely sup-

ported acid rain control bill in

' Congress last year.

  

 

 

  
     
 
     

"It's Congress that's undercut
when our two leaders do an acid‘

rain jig that fades as fast as the ~

camera |ights," Sikorski said.
"Each time the prime minister
of Canada saddles up to the “presi-
dent of the United States on acid
rain, he confuses the American
people, and he reduces the effec-
tive pressureon those of us in
Congress who are fighting to con-

trol acid rain.” ‘

Sikor_ski's comments came be-
fore a panel on clean air during
the Slstannual meeting of the

‘National Wildlife Federation.,

which was held in conjunction
with the annual meeting of the
Canadian Wildlife_ Federation.

‘ ' Reagan and Mulroney are to
meet April 5 and 6, and acid rain
ison the agenda. The summit will

bring a rare opportunity to curb
the problem, Sikorskisaid‘.

"The only way we who are op-

] posed to acid rain are going to get

the [Reagan] administration to
agree to anything positive or sub-
stantive is if the Canadian posi-
tion is straightforward, is
forthright and is vigorously pur-
sued,” he said.

Mulroney, he said, must not
put on a public show of friend-

—ship and complete agreement

with Reagan.

"It's hard enough to pass acid
rain legislation  without the

leader of the country suffering the I
horrible consequences — with
their whole economy, their

whole environment, their whole
culture at risk — siding up with
the most powerful American op-
ponent of acid rain controls,”
Sikorski said. ' »

Acid rain is caused when-sul-
fur and nitrogen oxides emitted
from coa|—burning power plants
and industries mix with water in
the atmosphere. "Every day over.
the North American continent,
«every 24 hours, 176,000 tons of
nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides
are shot into the skies,” Sikorski
said. "What goes. up comes
down. ' -

"We know that we've lost
hundreds and hundreds of lakes,
we've lost thousands and thou-

sands of miles of streams and
we've endangered millions and
millions of acres of farmland.
We've endangered historical

; monuments andlhuman health,

and we're fast making this planet
unliveable — if not for us, for. our

‘ children and their children.

"We havea whole world-wide
cemetery of dead lakes, dead fish

and dead forests to drive home I

the point."
~ Sikorski said he knows that

; clean-up would threaten jobs in

the coal industry and could mean
higher bills for electricity users.
Federal legislation must’ soften

,_

those blows while reducing emis- ,

sions of sulfur and nitrogen ox-
ides, he said.

SU victory will silence Boeheim’s critics

Big Ten vs. Big East.. Bobby
Knight vs. Jim Boeheim. Dis-
cipline vs. free spiritedness.

Yes, Indiana vs. Syracuse for
the 1987 NCAA basketball cham-
pionship.

At the beginning of the season,
these two teams had enormous
potential but a lot of question
marks to go along with it.

Many fans never would have «

thought that Knight's Hoosiers

and Boeheim’s Orangemen‘

could make it this far.
Knight took a team with one
great player — senior guard Steve

 

Alford —— and surrounded him
with several role players to
produce what has now become
a great team.

Earlier in the season things
didn't look so good for the Hoos-
iers though. Sure, they were win-
ning —— Indiana has lost only four
games all year —— but sophomore
forward Rick Calloway was in-
jured with a bad knee, and junior
college players Keith Smart and
Dean Garrett were still unproven.

But when the Big Ten season
started, the Hoosiers were a well-
oiled machine, and they rolled

Knight has great respect forOrangemen

By Hal Bock

AP Sports Writer

NEW ORLEANS — Tonight,
Hollywood's Hoosiers go for the
Oscars while Indiana's version
reaches for the NCAA basketball
championship.

Syracuse is the last hurdle for
Coach Bob Knight's team after In-
diana defeated Nevada—Las Vegas
97-93 and the Orangemen
downed Providence 77-63 in
Saturday's semifinals.

”I think Syracuse is as good a
team as there is in the country,”

~Knight said. ”Considering the

regional they came out of and the
way they've played, they're prob-
ably right where they ought to

. be.”

Syracuse was seeded No. 2 in
the East and reached the Final
Four by beating Georgia
Southern, Western Kentucky,

Florida and the region's No. 1
seed, North Carolina. Indiana
carried the No. 1 seed in the Mid-
west Region and beat Fairfield,
Auburn, Duke and LSU on the
toad to New Orleans and the Fi-
na|FouL

Syracuse is basically a seven-
man team, depending heavily on
their five starters -—»guards Sher-
man Douglas and Greg Monroe,
forwards Howard Triche and
Derrick Coleman and center
Rony Seikaly. Boeheim will sub-
stitute Stephen Thompson in the
backcourt and Derek Brower up
front, but he rarely goes deeper
than that.

Douglas’ defensive job on Bil-

Iy Donovan was a key element of -

the Providence victory, and he
could draw the assignment on In-
diana All-America Steve Alford,
who scored 33 against UNLV.
Monroe is Syracuse's 3-point

in the country.
— Bobby Knight

specialist. He hit three of the
home run shots against Provi-
dence and had to be watching
when UNLV’s Freddie Banks lit
it up with 10 against Indiana. ,

Triche is a good ball handler
and, at 6-5, can help off the
boards. ‘Like the other Syracuse
starters, he averaged in double
figures this season.

Coleman, a 6-9 freshman, and
Seikaly, a 6-10 junior, give the
Orangemen a twin tower look
underneath. Both have played

well throughout the tournament,
asserting themselves and improv-
ing what had been a spotty re-
bounding game for Syracuse.

Indiana's bench plays a more
significant role for the Hoosiers
behind starters Alford and Keith
Smart at guard, Rick Calloway
and Daryl Thomas at forward and
Dean Garrett at center. The
Hoosiers got important contribu-
tions from reserves Joe Hillman
and Steve Eyl, who hit a com-
bined 6-for-7 from‘ the floor
against—UNLV.

”Our bench has helped in
tough situations allyear,” Alford
said. ”They do an excellent job
coming in like that.” “

Smart and Garrett are junior
college transfers, a departure for
Knight who previously has-de-
pended on traditionalfour-year
recruits.

It's not so much because of any-

because of Syracuse coach Jim,

I'm going with the Orangemen
because of Boeheim. The much-
maligned (even by me) coach has
never made it to the Final Four in

his 11 years before now.

Boeheim has constantly,been
harassed by the press and fans -
especially in Syracuse — for his
team's inability to win in the
NCAA tou_rnament.

I think Indiana is a better team,
but the Orangemen are on a
mission.

Fate would
who may be Indiana's greatest
player ever, would finish his
career a winner.

But I think it's time for Boeheim I

to get his adversaries off his back.

Seikaly and freshman Derrick

Boeheim’s strategy to contain
Providence.

”You’ve got to contain Billy

”We’ve got a guy [Sherman

Two coaches have very contrasting styles

By John Nelson
AP Sports Writer

NEW ORLEANS — Bob Knight
and Jim Boeheim have both
thrown chairs in anger at basket-
ball games. The difference is in
how they threw them.

The coaches — Knight of Indi-
ana and Boeheim of Syracuse —
take their teams into the champi-
onship game of the NCAA
basketball tournament Monday
night.

They are a study in contrasting
styles, although they have one
thing in common — both have
been very successful.

In 22 years of coaching, the last

' 16 at Indiana, Knight has a record

of 467-1 69 and has won two na-
tional titles. While never winning
the national championship, Boe-

' heim has a career mark of 261-83

in 11 seasons at Syracuse.

Knight is the tough guy, the
basketball genius who spends his
off.hours fly fishing and reading
World War II history. His hero is
said to be Gen. George Patton.

Boeheim, on the other hand, is
the whiner, the guy who couldn't
win the big one, a former golf
coach and 8—handicapper.

Knight is in the news nearly as
often for his own antics as he is
for the accomplishments of his
team. He got into trouble with the
law in Puerto Rico during the
1979 Pan American Games‘, then
stuffed a Louisiana State fan into
a garbage can in a Cherry Hill,
N.J., hotel during the 1981 Final
Four. He threw a chair across the

court during a game in 1985, and.

he began this season in an angry

mood because of a book written a

about his 1985-86 season that he
felt contained too much of his
profanity. '

Like Knight, Boeheim is emo-
tional on the sidelines during
games, but he recognizes that his
reputation is not unmarked.
”People don't say I'm a good
coach," he said earlier in the
NCAA tournament. ”They don't
say I'm a bad coach. They say I'm
not bad.”

Boeheim has taken the Orange-
men into the NCAA tournament
nine times, but had never gotten
past the second round until this
yean

When he threw his chair, it was
in the privacy of the press room

during the 1983 Big East Confer-
ence tournament.

”I tend to think in terms of our
program,” Boeheim said Sunday
at a news conference. ”If people
respect our program, then I think
they'll have some respect for me.
I'm not really concerned from the
’me’ aspect, though.,So much is
made by the media of success in
the NCAA tournament — and
wrongly so, I think. I could have
been beaten in the first round,
and I guess then I'd still .have
been a lousy coach.”

Knight, too, professes little per-

sonal interest in winning another
national title, even though he
would join Adolph Rupp and
John Wooden as the only three-
time winners.

”The only significance at this
point for me is what it would
mean to our players,” Knight
said. 1

”I remember the thrill of play-
ing on an NCAA champion [with
Ohio State in 1960]. Either our
kids or Syracuse's kids are going
to be able to look back with fond-
ness at this Final Four and say
they were national champions.”

Seikaly

“there.”

Coleman contributed 12 points
and 12 rebounds, helping Seika-
ly bottle up Providence's inside
game.

”We know with this team you
can't win by stopping one play-
er,” said Douglas

‘'1 had a lot of help playing
against Donovan. When he went

through screens, sordebody was

bumping him all the time. I tried
to deny him the ball and force
him to the left, which is his weak
side. Our offense was not there.

Staff Writer

Dean Caliguire is ready to
make his move — and what a
strange one it is.

The 6-3, 263—pound sopho-

himself onto, well, onto the line
where he belongs. Last season,

Caliguire was best know for play-

sition 'known as the Angus back
— a big, hulking lineman who
positions himself in the offensive
backfield, thereby providing a lit-
tle extra horsepower to the run-
ning game. _

ead start gave me a bit of an ad-

vantage when trying to block the
defensive guys,” said Caliguire.
”But now I'm ready to get onto
the line and play the position I
know best.”

Caliguire and the oft-injured Ed
Miller are fighting for the starting
center position, and according to
new offensive line coach Bill

. Meyers, the battle is 

”Fierce. Dean and Ed are real-

ly going at it,” he said. ”lt’s a real

healthy competition. You can tell
both of these guys want the job.”

Caliguire came to Pitt from
Montour High as an AP and UPl
al|—state performer. ”The overall
reputation that Pitt has was what
attracted me -here,” said
Caliguire. ”When you think of a
Pitt guy, you think of a tough,
nasty, strong kind of player. A lot

Caliguire claims that his rap-

is what makes his job a whole lot
easier. A tough, cohesive group,
these players seem to have a lot

Said Caliguire, ”We’re all close

Gottfried not impressed with scrimmage?

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

On the heels of the end of the
NCAA basketball season, the Pitt
football team held their first in-
trasquad scrimmage yesterday af-
ternoon at Pitt Stadium.

”The guys were a little sluggish
today,” said Pitt head coach Mike
Gottfried. ”They played hard, but
I thought we would be a little far-
ther ahead than we are.”

Gottfried stressed that the team

4__

is still involved with basics be-
cause spring camp is just under-
way. ”This is only our fourth
day," said Gottfried. ”So we were
not trying anything new.”

The offensive backfield was led
by senior Charles Gladman with
118 yards on eight carries. He
also had two touchdown runs of
28 and 70 yards. Gladman was
the most impressive runner of the
day, as he seemed to be return-
ing to his 1 985 form after an off-
year last season. ’’I’m pleased

Nonetheless, they did receive
All-America recognition for Pitt,
but for a time, Daniels may not
have ended up at Pitt if it wasn't
for (of all things) an injury.

While at Suitland High School
in Forestville, Md., Daniels was
sought after by many college
track coaches. He was a
I 500—meter champion at the Gib-

son Relays in Jamaica. He

    
   
      

returned to the states and became
a half-mile indoor champion as
well as being named All-
Metropolitan", All—State and
Honorable Mention All-America.

He was in hisprime when the
injury occurred.

”At the time, I had just finished
running the 1500.[meters],” said
Daniels. ”Coaches were talking
to me, and then I got hurt in the
mile relay, but Coach Vasvary
was still interested.

”When I did get hurt, I was for-
gotten about until I came to Pitt.”

Vasvary, who never gave up on
Daniels, is obviously glad he
didn't.

”Joe’s been a good worker ever
since he's come to Pitt,” said Pitt
mens' track coach John Vasvary.
”He runs cross country, the two-

mile relay and does a lot of differ-_

ent things.”

”I'd like to qualify in the 800
for nationals, and_ possibly the
1500 in the IC4A’s,” said
Daniels. ”If I keep going strong
and increase my strength, I can
drop to the 800 which is my best

/ " -_ [event].”

The, Pitt News, Monday, Mclrch 30, 1987

Regarding the two-mile relay,

his All-America event, the team .

will lose Weiner and Manes be-
cause both are seniors. Is it pos-
sible that this might effect the
national success of Pitt's two-mile
relay team?

Daniels doesn't think so. _

”Hopefully, I'll get in some
good work over the summer,‘ and
guys like Tom Boggan and Joe
Turner can fill in. The coach is al-
ways getting good recruits, too,”
said Daniels.

Volleyball  
team ineligible
for playoffs

By Suzie Clair _

For The Pitt News

The Pitt men's club volley-
ball team is ineligible to par-

ticipate in their division‘

playoffs.

The men's team finished
their season with a record of
12-1.

According to Pitt coach Jeff
Beavers, ”Right now, because
of last year's lack of participa-
tion [there was no official team
last year] we are on probation.
.We cannot participate in the
Eastern division playoffs.

”The team wrote an appeal
to this decision, but the appeal
is under review,” continued
Beavers.

Now that the season is over .

and the playoffs are coming up
in mid—April, the team must
wait to hear a response to its
‘appeal.

Beavers, for one, thinks itis
unfair. ”I think penalizing this

year's team because of last ‘N

year's team is unfair, especial-
ly fora club outfit. It's not like
we're a varsity team,” said
Beavers.

According to Beavers, the
team is definitely not par-
ticipating in the men's nation-
al club championship
tournament in Texas, April
22-25.

Said Beavers, ”We are
bypassing the invitation be-
cause of a lack of funds. It
would cost $2,000 to get the
team down there. If it [were]
closer, we would definitely go.
We have a good team this
year.”

- The men's volleyball team
plays as aclub and receives
equipment funds from the Stu-
dent Government Board. All
other financial support is
generated by the team mem-
bers through fund raising.

Pitt lost to IUP in their last
conference match of the sea-
son Friday night. They lost the
match in five games 3-2. Satur-
day, the team lost in the quar-
terfinals at IUP’s tournament.

Just like Rodney Dangerfield,
lacrosse team gets no respect

By Rae Ann Collette

For The Pitt News

The Pitt Panther Lacrosse Club
continues to strive for improve-
ment despite the lack of fan sup-
port and university funds. ~
In the past, the Lacrosse Club
was «very disorganized. Club
members did not regularly attend
practices and games, and the
club's scheduling of activities was
also haphazard.
But, with the dedication and

help of club leaders Ortheo Bux-‘

ton, Craig Jackson, Bob
Mankowski and Todd Zwikl, club
members now participate on a

 regular basis, and there is more
‘ team unity.

Buxton, the acting play-
er/coach for the '87 season, said
that the club's organization is bet-
ter this year as opposed to last
season, although, some problems
still remain.‘ -

For instance, the serious injury
of club member Bob Mankowski,
who played a crucial role in es-
tablishing club unity, put a clamp-
er on things. Buxton said, ”A few
guys on the team even quit after
his injury.”

Buxton also pointed out the
problem with obtaining. the Pitt

Stadium field for home games. ‘

”The football team gets priority
with the field  we had, to resche-
dule our practices to work around
their practices.”

The problem with fan support
is one of the club's major,set—
backs. Buxton would like to see
more people attend the lacrosse
home games in hopes that such
fan support would boost the
club's spirit. .

Jackson, vice president of the
Panther Lacrosse Club, said that
the opposing team consistently
has more fans at Pitt's home
games. ”We need to get people
interested," Jackson said. ”The
guys on the team practically drag
their friends up to our games.”
" Todd Zwikl, team secretary,
claimed, that not enough of the
student body knows about the
lacrosse games. Added Zwikl,

' ”The club. supports itself.”

But the team members really
feel sports fans are missing out on
something special. ”Lacrosse is
exciting to watch —’it’s a colli-
sion sport," said Zwikl.

Jackson suggested that lacrosse

should appeal to many students-

because it is like ”hockey in air.”
Jeff Lafuria, a fr_iend ofJackson_’s

Despite the . low fan atten-
.dence, the Panther Lacrosse Club
‘plays home games on Thursday
nights during the season and
sometimes on the weekends.

Because lacrosse is not a Big
East sport, the university does not
sponsor the Pitt Lacrosse Club
which constitutes yet another
major setback for the club.

As a consequence, the club I

does not receive a full time, paid
coach. ‘Club members unani-
mously agree that a hired coach
would provide more stability for
the club. V

During the season different

A people attempt to o,r'g_:a,n_izde‘g,cI'ub
matters,’ and such ._acti‘o‘ns prove 

to be disruptive.
Since the university does not

sponsor the club, members must

pay monthly dues in order to
cover costs such as home—game
referee fees.

”Our biggest problem was get-
ting the guys to pay their dues on
time, but it's better this year,”
said Jackson.

Each member must also pur-
chase his equipment, which is
quite expensive. ”The guys don't
seem to mind, though,” Jackson
said. ”They just love to play.”

department and the student
government to support us more

referee fees.”

So far this season, the club's
record is 0-3, but Buxton said that
the club played the first half of
last Thursday's game ”skillfully
and with high spirits.” Hopeful-
ly, things will be looking up for

the team in the. near future. Ad-
