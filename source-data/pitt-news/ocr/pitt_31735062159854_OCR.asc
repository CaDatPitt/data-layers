MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE——Students crowd
around the Student Desk to get back the money
they paid for Michigan State train-game tickets.

The trip was called off at the last minute after
success was almost in sight. Full price will be
paid for all outstanding tickets.

ain  

 

(See editorial “Better Charter a Bus” on page four.)
Students who bought tickets on the ill—fated train to
Michigan State today were making arrangements to get to

East Lansing by bus and auto.

One group of 37 publications

members has already chartered a bus.
A last minute attempt to send the train by reducing the
number to 300 and using the Pennsylvania railroad was

defeated early Wednesday morn-4

ing when the company reported
that it could not send a separate
train.

The Pennsy, however, offered to
hook special cars to the rear of a
regular train and route it through
to East Lansing. The offer was re-
jected because it meant a one hour
layover in Detroit on the way to
the game and a two and one half
hour layover on the way back.

Returned Too Early

The most serious argument
against accepting the offer was
due to the train’s departure time
from East Lansing. The return
trip would have begun at 6:37 p.m.
Saturday afternoon.

The Pennsylvania on Tuesday
afternoon had agreed to make up
a special train with seating for a
minimum of 300 but had to with-
draw the offer when one of the
four other lines over which the
train would pass rejected the plan.
The company said it would lose
money on 300 fares. '

Original plans had the Pitts-
burgh and Lake Erie railroad fur-
nishing the train. But the same

company that objected to the
Pennsylvania’s offer also scuttled
the P. & L. E. arrangements.

Sales Picked Up Monday

Sales for. the train had lagged
until Monday and Tuesday when
a mild spurt pushed the number
of tickets purchased to near the
250 mark. Backers of the train
had felt that the 300 mark would
have been easily reached on Wed-
nesday. A

Michigan State student groups
had made elaborate plans for host-
ing the ticket purchasers as part
of their Homecoming Week. The
train would have arrived in East
Lansing at 7 a.m. and left at mid-
night. .

Sponsors of the train blamed the
failure on student indiﬁerence.
Bob Gardner was chairman of the
committee which included Larry
Adler and Buzzy ‘Robbins.

A similar project for the Notre
Dame game last year was an over-
whelming success. The train for
the Pennsylvania game ‘the year
before failed.

Friday, Nov. 30 have fallen

Government Clinic chairman

James Rock announced Wednes-¢

day, SC will hold its open session
for the beneﬁt of the student body

here.
Lacked Support

The plan as originally proposed '

was abandoned because of_ lack
of support -from the Superinten-
dent of Pittsburgh Public Schools,
Dr. Earl A. Dimmick, and Mr. C.
W. H. Pullun, Director of Social
Studies for the Pittsburgh Public
Schools. They said_ they wouldn’t
lend their support for two rea-
sons: lack of proper leadership and
the fact that a state-wide asso-
ciation is already in existence
which would only be duplicated
by SC’s efforts.

These same men made two rec-
,ommendations to Student Con-
gress:

1. To send several representa-
tives to the meeting -of the state-
wide association as observers.

_2. To send representatives from
Student Congress to visit district

high school student councils and_
‘write an evaluation of them. '
Coolly Received

James Rock, who
these recommendations, said they!
were received “coolly” by SC: 3

He was however able to get one
member, Nancy Tear, to make the
trip to the Kittanning meeting of
the Pennsylvania Association of
Student. Councils. «

Two other students, Ernie Smith
and Lewis McCullough, along with
J. Edward Ricart, assistant to the
dean of men, also attended the
meeting.

Pitt Chest Head Plans Dance;

Committee Asks $2 Donation

The Pitt Chest council today_ is planning an all-student
dance to plug its fall solicitation.’
The dance is tentatively set for Friday, Nov. 16.

The Chest Council has secured¢

approval of the idea, but as yet a
dance hall, orchestra,‘ and enter-
tainment are not lined up.

Deﬁnite action on the dance is
slated for today’s regular meeting
of the Chest Council.

Admission to the dance might
be either by receipt from class-
room donations or a nominal do-
nation at the door. All dance pro-

ceeds» will go to the Chest Fund. .

The dance will be informal and
open to all. . -

This year’s goal has been set at
$2 per student by the Council’s
ratio and goal sub—committee.

According to Ronald Ecker,
Chest Drive chairman, “The Chest
Committee has set‘ $2 as the
amount desired from each student
in order to reach our minimum
goal. We hope that there will be
many who will donate more than
their quota, but if the student

 

gift will be appreciated.”

The two dollars provides ap-
proximately two cents apiece’ for
each of the 99 Chest agencies. So-
licitations will be. made in the
classrooms on Wednesday, Nov. 14
during fourth hour, and Thursday,
Nov. 15, third hour.

Received Honor Mark

Last week, however, Mr. Fedel
received notice that ‘the National
University of Ireland has awarded
him the First Honor Mark—an
award given only to someoneiwho
has proved exceptionally deserv-
mg. . , »

Mr. Fedel hadas the subject for
his honor-winning dissertation the
Irish short-story ‘writer, Daniel
Corkery. .

He said that he chose Corkery
because he‘ was the_most modern
writer whose life works are com-
pleted. I

In order to achieve the First
Honor Mark, Mr. Fedel’s work had
to be. acutely .judged. A board of
three examiners, onejrom Trinity
College, Dublin, one from Oxford
University, and an “internal ex-
aminer” from University College,
Dublin, reviewed. the student’s
yearly’ work, his thesis, and his
ﬁnal examination. “That’s when
they really throw anything and
everything at you,” Fedel said.

, _Helped by Expert

Mr. Fedel prepared his thesis
under the direction of Dean J.
Hogan, the “internal examiner”,
and studied under Professor Roger
McHugh, one of the outstanding
authorities on Anglo-Irish Liter-

ature,. according to the former ’ '

Pittite. .
Although he had to study almost

constantly, Mr. Fedel, found time_

to write, and several of his short
stories were published in Ireland.

‘Just Like The Real Thing

 

‘Russian ’

By LOIS FOIGHT
The model'United ‘Nations Se-
curity Council session held in
Stephen Foster Memorial Wed-
nesday was as like the real thing
as Pitt students and faculty could

make it. And it -was alike pri-
" marily in being as confusing and
_ inconclusive as original Council

sessions have been.

This was the opinion of Dr. Al-
bert B. Martin, assistant professor
of political science and faculty ad-
visor to the program. He stated:

_“We demonstrated today the gen— ‘

eral confusion over a critical

problem such as this, even among

governments.” ~ —

“Should Red China Be Admitted
to the United Nations?” was the
question before the 11 graduate
and undergraduate student dele-
gates to the mock session.

Foreign Students Speak

Five of the delegates were citi-
zens of the countries represented.
All delegates presented a written
statement of their country’s view-

. point on the question under the

direction of Robert Gardner, dele-
gate from China and president of
the session. Strict parliamentary
proceedure was enforced by the
president. \ ‘

An overﬂow crowd of district
high school and college students
mingled with interested Pittites in
the Foster Social Room. A large
group of grade school students
from the Colfax school also at-
tended. ‘

Russia Leaves Session

Highlight of the p_resentation
came when Doris Lyda, a first
year Pitt Law student; simulated
the antics of Yakov A. Malik and,
‘representing Russia to the letter,
stalked out of the room. She left
an impotent discussion and know-
ing smiles behind her.

Delegates to the model session
were attended, as Security Coun-
_cil “delegates are in reality, by
their advisors. A member of the
faculty and a student had worked.
with each delegate in preparing

‘UN No Symbol

‘Of Futility,’ .

O O ‘
Says Ltltenthal

“The United Nations represents
an extension of the democratic
ideal . . . applied to the world
community,” declared David Lili-
enthal Wednesday night at the
Carnegie Music Hall.

Mr. Lilienthal, the former chair-
man of‘the Atomic Energy Com-
mission and past head of the TVA,
spoke before a sizeable crowd

gathered to observe the sixth an- '

niversary of the founding of the
UN. ' ‘
,Ass_erting that “the UN is not a
speciﬁc cure-all for our troubles,”
Lilienthal stated that it also was

“not a symbol of futility . . . as
human institutions go.”
He mentioned as concrete ac-

complishments of the world or-
ganization these Items: the with-
drawal of Soviet troops from Iran:
mediation of problems in Indone-
sia; settlement of the dispute in
Greece; and conciliation of the
Jewish—Arab ‘conﬂict in Palestine.

Lilienthal, while believing that
weshould ‘talk softly, but carry a
big stick,” deplored the excessive
emphasis upon armaments. “We
can talk ourselves. into war,” he
said. ‘ ’

“The _success of the United
Nations,” concluded Lilienthal,
“depends on you.” .

The apathy of the student body was matched by the
disinterest of the supporters of the train. Instead of button-
holing individuals and speaking to groups, they relied upon
posters and badges to sell tickets. They failed to get di-
rectly to the buyer. ~ ' I _

And the organized groups waited too long to get on the
band wagon or else'they ignored it. IF Council failed to

. see that its assistance was necessary and so did nothing

to promote sales. One fraternity even chartered a bus in

conflict with the train.

Internal politics have turned our. formal organizations
into ‘sewing circles and stepping stones for prestige. There

' is more importance attached to the positions than to the

Work accomplished while in these positions.

“So we have a train that has ﬂo\pped because no "more-
than 250 students out of a minimum of_7000 fulltime stu-
dents felt like using it. ‘We might ashwell all charter buses.

We ask too much when we expect the‘18-year- it

whether it is immoral for a boy to playfor money.

But the moral question holds little weight against
the pressing argument that a stadium 'must be paid

Among the most thankless of tasks in intercollegiate
sports is to run on the cross country squad. Just ask Carl
Olson’s hard working harriers, who are gaining a national
reputation with a 3-1 record over major competition, but
are comparatively unknown at Pitt.

Nevertheless, Olson’s home-grown‘ thinclads seek their

Michigan State would be near the

Head Coach Biggie Munn to say,
“I don’t think we’re that good, but

With 25 lettermen bolstering the

appears rather conservative to say
the least. ‘

With tomorrow’s game an as-

before two consecutive capacity
crowds for the ﬁrst time in years.

their intersectional clash with the
second ranking team in the nation

A capacity crowd "of 50,000
‘Homecoming Day’ fans will wit-

a romp for the powerful Spartans.

The only dim light that ﬂickers
for Coach Tom Hamilton's grid-

fense with gunner-like accuracy.

Bestwick completed 19 passes that
gained 252 aerial yards-—-enough
‘to surpass the old mark of 211. _

Now just eight completed throws
from another Rickard mark of 90
completions, Bestwick goes after
his second passing record. _
‘ Warriner, the sure-ﬁngered sen-
ior from 'Tarentum, has been
tagged ‘one of Pitt’s greatest pass-
catchers’. He’s only nine grabs

If it looks‘ as good inside as it does outside, there will
be no complaints from this corner. , V
a The above could only refer to the $195 million ﬁeldhouse
above the Stadium now being rapidly completed for the Pitt-
Geneva basketball game on Saturday, ‘Dec. 8. -

The basketball court will be
112 feet long by 72 feet in width.
There is an 8,000 seating ca-
pacity in comparison to the 2,800
seating capacity of the Stadium.

Large Sports, Program
In addition to basketball, track,

‘ wrestling, gymnastics, s q u a s h,

handball, and volley ball can be
played at the ﬁeldhouse while
room will be available for indoor
practice of football, baseball, ten-
nis, and golf.

The outside work on the struc-
ture is almost completed while
grading and leveling inside will be
started next week.

According to Frank Carver, Uni-
versity Athletic Publicity Director,
“They’re a couple of days behind
schedule, but we’re hoping that
the thing will be completed by
Nov. 15 so that the basketball team
will get a chance to practice on the
ﬂoor.”

Plans now call for dedication»

' ceremonies to precede the Co-

_ lumbia-Pitt basketball game on
Saturday, Dec. 15. ’ ’

, Not Closed Proposition

In addition to college ball, the
WPIAL high school sectional bas-
ketball elimination series will be
held in the ﬁeldhouse. The PIAA
has taken a favorite attitude to-
ward staging the basketball ﬁnal
at the ﬁeldhouse, whereby district
fans may be able to see the high
school state basketball champion-
ship right here in Pittsburgh
rather than take the annual trek to
Philadelphia. “

The. Stadium pavilion is now
being used for basketball practice
for Pitt’s Varsity, but just as soon
as the ﬁeldhouse is completed, the
hoopsters will transfer to the_ﬁeld-
house while the Stadium will be
used for intramural basketball,

squash, and volleyball.

Plans call for three basketball
courts to be set up at the Stadium
for intramural purposes.
220-Yard Track _

When the newest addition to the
Pitt family of‘buildings is com-
pleted it will contain: '

Two practice, intramural, or
physical education courts 60 feet
by 50 feet. »

220-yard indoor dirt track.

Practice area for football, base-
ball, tennis, and golf. .
‘ Wrestling room, gymnastics
room, eight squash courts, and two.
handball courts.

Dressing room, training rooms,
basket room to accommodate 500.
at one time. Oﬁice space for entire
department, in addition to two
large conference rooms.

74:-Yard Reverse

This year’s football team hopes
to do much better than their pre-
decessors did at the Stadium last
year when Michigan State drubbed
Pitt, 19-0. That was bad enough
butwhen the statistics showed the
Panthers’ efforts for the afternoon,
that was all. The rushing attack
came out minus 63 yards and the
passing offense showed a deﬁcit of
11 yards. The totals for the game,
were 74 yards lost.

World war I Vet

A machine gunner in the First
World War, "Mr. Lotz used to en-
tertain his buddies on a ﬁve-octave
piano in the dugouts directly be-
hind the front lines. After the
armistice, he was in charge of a
regimental band until his dis-
charge. -

In keeping with the tradition,
that the, show must go on, Mr.
Lotz once‘ played _a concert with‘
a badly burned_ hand.

On this particular occasion, the
piano had been placed too far

down stage and the footlights A

were shining right in the organ-
ist’s eyes, hindering his playing.

In order not to bother the stage
crewmen, he leaned over to un-
screw one or two of the hot bulbs
himself. _ ' .

With a painful skin burn on his
right hand, ‘Mr. Lotz then contin-
ued to play and ﬁnished the con-
cert. ‘ ~ . ‘
