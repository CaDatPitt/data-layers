Freight, Trade
Boost District 0
Business Index-

’ Business in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict increased slightly last week
due to increased freight shipments

and gains‘ in volume trade, the Uni-
versity Bureau of Business Re-
search reported Friday. The‘ Bu-
reau's index reached. 145.3 per cent
of the 1923-25 average, a rise of
four points from the previous
week.

. Contributing to the increased
business district, steel mills contin-
ued to operate a-t near-capacity,
not yet reflecting any effects of
the captive mine labor dispute.

Rail and river tonnage was

heavy and department store sales
increased to ‘a point 17 per cent

greater than in the same four‘-—

weeks period last November. High-
er prices account for part of the
increase in the dollar‘ business, the
Bureau maintained.

Today all undergraduate Women in the University
begin an extensive three-day drive\ for funds to con-. »

by the faculty and alumnae campaigns which have
been in progress for several months are expectedgto

boost the fund to.$30,000.

Letters have been sent 'to all women students by
the presidents of their classes, and plans have been
* made to have a representative from each’ class con-

Book   Drive Increase  

Faculty and student contributions continued to grow in number
today as the week-old Student-Faculty association book drive for men
in army service neared the Wednesday deadline. .

Textbooks, both new and used, have been the most popular dona-
tions to date, according»; to Lois Galbreath, C42, co-chairman of the
drive. Popular fiction closely followed texts in number of contributions.

Other non-ﬁction books also in-
creased as the drive progresesd.

Gilbert Seaman, E42, is “head
donator up to this point,” Miss Gal-
breath stated. “I believe he brought
in enough books to fill a good size
bookcase,” she said. ,

Ralph Hines, Ed42, also co-

chairman, added that while contri-

— butions have been coming in fre-

quently, the student supply is “far
from exhausted.”

“Many books that students have
not been using for‘ some time are on
bookshelves in their homes gather-
ing dust. This is a wonderful op-
portunity to help the boys in camp
by donating these books, and I
think it is foolish to pass it by.”

Mr. and Mrs..Doake.s Attend (1 Reception

As they approached the Cathed-

not sure What to expect.

They had a few visions of des-
peratewattempts to ﬁght their way
thorugh a mob to see some be-sp,ec-
tacled crabby teacher, of getting
lost in‘ “that building,” and of get-
ting so hungry from all the walk-

entrance they were met by a stu-
dent aide. Before they had time to
feel the least bit lost, the. aide in-
troduced himself, asked their
names and led them both to a
checkroom. A woman student aide
took Mr. and Mrs. Doakes to seats
in -the “auditorium.” ‘
lAfter an address by Dr. Row-
J man, they were escorted by an-
other student to tables ’where sec-
retaries from the Registrar’: office
gave them, Johnny's grade cards.
, “Look at,that,” _Mr..‘Doak,es said

cracked that book.”

“J. J. Geise is his instructor in
that subject, let's go see him first,”
said Mrs. Doakes. No sooner were
those, words spoken when an aide
stepped up to ‘them, asked the

. number of the room they were
seeking and showed them the stair-
way nearest it. _

After seeing all of Johnny’s in-
structors, Mr. and Mrs. Doakes
made their way back to the Com-

gmons room. a ,

“Ah, food!" whispered. Mr.
Doakes as he sighted the long

And Meet the University's Chancellor

Bowman’s receiving line.

Mrs. Doakes told the Chancellor
she was very glad to have the op-
portunity. tosee the University.

As she slowly sipped. her cup of
coffee, ’Mrs.'Doakes said, “He looks
to me like he doesn’t eat enough.
I bet some of my potato pancakes
would fix him up.”

As they went out the door on
their way home an aide gave them
a copy of the magazine Pitt and

t the special freshman issue of the

Pitt News and bade them good-

night. .

“women students, in entertaining, could learn how to
be truly hospitable, how to balance things social
with things intellectual.” ‘.

It was Miss Amos’ desire to complete the entir,
’ twelfth ﬂoor bythe end of this school year, but it‘
was her particular wish that 1217 be furnished in’
the style of the age in "which the University was
founded, and attempt to “embody in,its.arran’gemen1t,
its furnishings, and its decorations, the ideals of
gracious living.”
Helen Poole Rush, acting dean of women, urged-
every woman to contribute to the drive with the feel-
ing that she is contributing to more than a lasting
memorial to aperson who will always live in Pitt’s
ideals of traditions. ‘

“She should feel that/here is a golden opportunity

to make something completely her own, for
really belong to the women.” 1
In mentioning speciﬁc plans for the room Miss,
Rush said that it vwill be furnished much like the
former women’s reading goom on the sixthpﬂoor. lt

the steel companies should certain-
ly not have anything to do with the
relations between employers and
workers.

This is especially true when over
95 per cent of the miners in the
captive mines are at this very, mo-'
ment memhers of the ‘UMW.

The question which immediately
arises, of course, is that if the un-
ion had such an open and shut case
why did the Mediation Board re-
fuse to grant its request? The an-
swer is plainly one of personal an-
tagonism‘: ".\: ‘E3:  . . .1‘ -2
Thelmemhersl of the board. (andé,
the public) allowed their personal
dislike for John L‘. Lewis to color
their decision.‘ In ‘a" similar case——
but not, so strong a one from.‘ the
union" viewpoint  the board" not
long ago granted the closed ‘shop.
But not to John L. Lewis.  1

It must be admitted,,of course,
that they have ample reason, for
disliking Lewis. and many of. the
things he has done. However; they
should not allow it . to enter into
their judgment on a perfectly leg-
itimate union request. A

The question now is, “What
should the President do?” One
thing is immediately plain. He
should not send the troops to force

any workers hack in the mines.

This would probably mean blood-
shed. And it would certainly’ not
insure ‘the efficient running of the
mines—which is the primary goal.

Another personal conference be-
tween himself, the management of
the mines and the leaders, of labor
should he the first step. If, how-
ever, this step does not accomplish
anything, it is obvious he go‘ i

Service, Bureau

On Government

International Student Service re-
cently announced the opening of a
Student Service bureau in Wash-
ington, D. C.

Purpose of the Washington bu-
reau is to provide students and
members of faculties first-hand op-
portunities to study operations of
the Federal government.

Joseph P. Lash, general secre-
tary of ISS, gave. reasons for es-
tablishment of the new bureau:

“The need for first-hand obser-
vntion as a means to implement
. . . knowledge acquired in the
classrooms has been recognized by
students and teachers. Teachers
have encouraged their students to

u ‘make trips to Washington. Thou-

: sands have come every year alone .

or in» groups ,_hoping, to. obtain a
close view of the government in
action.

“For most of them, this hope
has not been fulﬁled . . . no agency

use all the ‘possibilities for a deep-
or understanding of what the capi-
tal of this democracy symbolizes.
Hence the establishment of our
Washington bureau.”

To college students and teachers
the new ofﬁce offers these speciﬁc
services. .. ,_

(1) Conferences on topics of po-
litical, social and economic inter-
ests. .First gathering will be a
live daysession, November 28 to
"December 2. Government officials
will lead the discussions.

(2) Aid to’ teachers and indi-
vidual students collecting material
tor special studies, to" those’ desir-
ing information about speciﬁc leg-
islation, careers in government
service, civilian defense, etc. ~

(3) Assistance with ﬁeld trips,
including visits to departments,
lhureaus, and agencies. These visits
will be prepared in close coopera-
tion with appropriate ofﬁcials who
will assist students and be avail-
able for questions and instructions.

(4) Information to individuals
and groups of teachersgand stu-
dents concerning the legislative,
administrative, judicial, and tech-
nical resources of the government.

For further information, address
Miss Molly Yard, Washington Stu-
dent Service Bureau, 1155-16th St.,

Bedtime Story No. l:

‘Two Kent State (Ohio) univer-
sity men were ejected from their
rooming house by an irate house-
smother one night recently.

Unable to contact the dean of
men or the dean of women, they
phoned President K. C. Leebrick

New Worldvorlder Must

Borrow From
By rnnnxemnsronaxi’ ' ', _
In the days to come we have it
gtiave task before us. It is for us,
the citizens of the United States,
together with the people of other
nations to unite in one sincere ef-
fort to attain a happy medium of
economic, political, and social life.
At no time in the history of the
world has a given. people had so
great an opportunity to analyze,
select and synthesize, not a per-
fect order, but a better one than
already exists. We cannot turn our
backs to systems which have rock-
ed our contemporary world.

To many of us the words Com-

munism, Nazism, Fascism, Social-

ism, and Capitalism have unhappy
connotations. Each system propos-
ed by one of the above isms has its
evils but, we must remember, its
virtues as well.

Communism, though administer-
ing limited relief to a majority of
the people, refuses them the right
to self-determination. The Ameri-
can housing system was first con-
ceived and practiced in Russia.

Nazism destroys rational think-
ers, but gives to its followers em-
ployment, and solves the “money
problem by eliminating‘ a gold or
silver standard.

Fascism is too regimental. How-

All "lsms'  

ever, the economic dictatorial pow-
er exercised by industrialists under
Fascism is less than the-authority
exercised by many of the corpora-
tion heads in the United States.
Socialism, while curtailing pri-
vate initiative," advocates such so-
cial reforms (now in this country)
as social security’ and a public
school system.

Capitalism, which stimulates
progress, through the severity of
its injustices (70% of the people
receive from 500 to 2000 dollars
a year which is only 40% of the
total income) invites antagonism
which often results in cruel, unre-
strained world wars.

Let us suppose now that Capital-
ism-is the better of the other isms.

Let's assume the following:
There is more good in Capitalism
than bad; there is more bad in
Communism, Nazism, Fascism, So-
cialism, than good. We admit there

is some bad in Capitalism and some
good in Communism, etc. Why not
attempt to merge the good with
the good and discard the bad?

Often pointed out as the pride
and joy of Capitalism is the United
States’ high standard of living. This
high standard is only for 11% of
the population. The rich here are
much wealthier than the rich in,
let's say Sweden.

The poor in Sweden are wealthi-
er than the poor in the United
States. There is no great_gap,be‘-
tween rich and poor in Sweden as
there exists in the United States.

_It is very difficult to solve the
problem.’ But it can be solved.
vWhy' not" apply a principle of so-
cialism, or if the word socialism‘
annoys you call it equalized capi-
talism.

. No bloody revolution is needed.
No hysterical outbreaks. No damn-
ing war of millions. Just sensible,
cool thought.

Of course it may be the other
way around. Communism may be
desirable but lacking in certain
“liberal” principles. Here an ap-
plication of Capitalism may be just
the thing. ‘

Though not one of the isms is a ‘

perfect system, Capitalism is a
good point to begin with. Let us
amend. Capitalism with principles
of the other isms as the people of
the world ﬁnd amendments desir-
able. -

be a singular, exclusive system, but

‘At The Stanley

For the third time this year, the
‘Andrews sisters return to the Stan-
ley stage, and for the third time
this year their tuneful jiving and
musical mugging makes for a
swingy. entertaining session.

The girls bring nothing new with
them, nothing that swing fans
throughout the nation haven't
heard times before; but all their
old arrangements, “In Apple Blos-
zsom Time," “Daddy,” “Scrub Me
‘Momma With a Boogie Beat,”
“Why Don't We Do This More
Often,” are novel enough in them-
selves to insure a 'warm reception
for the famous trio.

Jetter than ever, though, is
Patty (the tall» blonde job in the
middle) Andrews, whose second-
chorus improvising and first rate
'-solos,‘sound better with each re-
turn engagement.

‘On hand with his trumpet and
his orchestra is Johnny “Scat" Da-
vis, featuring vocalists Gloria Van
and Joe Martin. Davis, who play-
ed with Fred Waring before start-
ing a band of his own, might‘lis-
‘ten to his former employer's ag-
gregation and catch some of his
versatility, noticeably lacking the
Davis outﬁt. ' O V’ '
" When Davis and his trumpet and

hisvorchestra swing out, theyplay
with a blatancy that is little short
of ecstatic to jitterbug ears.‘ But
when Davis and his trumpet, _etc.,
tryto play a smooth, dreamy, ro-
mantle‘ ballad, there is far too much
brass and blatancy for dreamy ro-
mance.

Davis himself, however, still
plays a powerful trumpet. in fact
he far outblows the‘, other ﬁfteen
members of his band. It’: a musical
ﬁeld day for lovers of the unmuted
trumpet when Davis is in the spot-

tain time you probably will, but
the “preoccupation of the subcons-

and causes waking, tossing, and
general restlessness.” fit’s hardly

Edgar “Special Delivery” Jones was mailed last Saturday
afternoon at the Pitt stadium, but after he tore away for a
'43-yard touchdown with only two minutes of the first quarter
gone,-he was relegated to the dead letter office, and as a result
the erratic Panther forces were humiliated before a crowd of

- 33,000 people by an inspired Penn State eleven, 31-7.

Not since 1919 when Coach Bob Higgins ran wild against
the Blue and Gold did the Nittany Lions beat Pitt in the local
-stadium, but last Saturday they took revenge for all their

-losses.

They showed a brilliant passing attack in Smaltz to

Krouse, a magniﬁcent broken-ﬁeld runner in diminutive “Pep-
per” Petrella, and a forward wall that completely outrushed

the Panthers to roll up their 31
points. , , _ , ,

P  the localifans had any visions
before the Penn State contest of
seeing Edgar Jones named on the
nation's all-American teams, they
Were‘ deﬁnitely crushed by 4:30
o'clock Saturday. Jones started the
game in whirlwind fashion when

‘ he took a reverse from Dutton ear-

ly in the opening stanza, and elud-
ed the entire State secondary. to
score Pitt's first and only tally of
the day. On the extra point, Jones‘
dropped the ball as Fife was ready
to kick, but he hurriedly scooped’
it up and circled left end for the
additional point.

At this point, there was not one
person in the entire stadium or
press box that doubted Jones’ ca-
pability of« making the honored set.
They cheered and applauded this

miracle man. But fate dished him

‘sou-Ia different role on this particu?

lar day for from then on until the
ﬁnish of the game, he took a back
seat for Smaltz, Krouse, and Pe-
lrella. Jones.’ kicking was not as
good as usual, his injured shoulder
hampered his passing, and the
"charging State line would not give
‘him a running chance.

“Pepper” Petrella caused trou-
ble for the Bowsermen last year,
-and was expected to be rather both-
ersome once more. But who would
believe that this little speedster
lirom Downingtown, Pa._, would
score three-,, touchdowns against
Pitt. Petrella did not start the

. game, but entered soon after the

-opening whistle. He did not waste
‘much time in carrying the ball

ed, Petrella. had scored State’s first

The half ended with :1... visitors V

nhowing a 14-7 advantage. It was
nothing at all. the conﬁdent Pan-

ther rooters proclaimed, hadn't
they beaten the great Ram squad,
and didn’t they score twice in the
last five minutes of the game
against Nebraska to win, 13-7. 50
the fans didn't worry, nor did the
footballers. Let's wait until {the last
quarter K

Then came the third quarter.
And again that little man, Petrella,
got into the Panther’s hair. He
caught the opening kickoff and re-
turnedrit to the St'ate"_49.‘ A Smaltz
to Krouse pass picked up eight.
and Pepper made it a first down
on the Pitt 40-yard line. A few
more plays through the line, an-
other pass from Smaltz, and Pep-
per delivered. This time it was a
beautiful 24-yard sprint . around

tally. , , _

perfect ﬁeld goal from the 16.

The Lions did not let up as the
ﬁnal period got underway, in fact,
the Lions were just getting
warmed up to their task. Pitt had
the ball on their own 25-yard line,
and they started to pass. Unfortu-
nately, without Jones to toss the
ball, Pitt hadn’t an attack, conse-
quently a State back intercepted
the ball on the 40-yard line. Smaltz
uncorked a heave to Krouse that
took the ball up to the Panther
goal line. After two unsuccessful
tries at the double stripe, Ventres-
co cut over left guard for the
score.

Punks Dominate All-lntramural Squad,-
Ziolkowski Named Mythical Captain

Dr JERRY RIPP
It's getting to be habit with the
Punks, this business of being on
the Pitt News all-intramural team.
Last year they had the most
énien mentioned, and again this sea-
son they lead every team. In fact

Every member of the Punks start- ’

ilng team, ‘and even one of their re-
iiserves made this year's mythical
squad.

Captain of this
-3easo,n's teamvis
Eddie Ziolkow-
ski, who is also
Bo-captain of the
Ilasketball team.
Ziol, gwho does
‘all of the pass-
iing for the in-
jwincible Punks,
was a member
Lil‘ last year's
team, and this

season is the unanimous choice of

the intramural officials, who pick-
ed the squad.

Playing inexi to Ziol on this
;cea.r’s “dream team” is Dave
"Bulgy” Ma'ma'u.\, leader of the
='AE&ME seniors. Bulge is .strcam
dined this year, and was better than
aver before. His bullet passes to
{Marshall Winkler, his long punts,
and his daring runs made him the
iyensation of the engineering loop.

This year's all—star team had
plenty of stellar backﬁeld men,
and made the selection of the out-
ntanding backs pretty tough. But
when the ﬁnal analysis was made,
-Harry Abramovitz, speed merchant
for Sigma Alpha Mu, got the nod.

ZIOLKOWSKI

 

Harry played with a team that
sdidn’t even reach the semi-ﬁnal
round of the Greek league. Never-
theless, his ability to carry the mail
a la Edgar Jones made him the nat-
ural choice for the number three
post in the backﬁeld.

Up on the line, the intramural
oﬂicials put three big men who
were able to crash in on the de-
fense, and get down the field fast
for passes on the offense.

Steve ‘Shuber, playing his first
season for the Punks, put his 6
feet 4 inches to good use in getting
behind thli defense and pulling
Ziolkowski’s long passes out of the
air. "He towered‘ over overyone try-
ing to cover him,‘-and was on the
sco.ring- end of many passes.

Coleman of the Phi Eps, was
the mainstay of the entire Phi Ep
inner defense. His ability to get in
fast and rush the passer, plus his
blocking on offense, easily earned
him a spot on this year's all-star
aggregation. '

Kenny “Buck”' Defoe, like Cole-
man, was the “whole works” as
far as the Phi Delt line was con-
cerned. While not as big‘ as Shuber
or Coleman, Buck was big enough
to snare long passes, and break up
many plays on the defense.

At center this season, is a play-
er who made last season’s mythi-
cal team, but not as center, thus
proving his versatility. He is Ar-
nold Biron of the Phi Eps. Biron’s
ability to get away fast after snap-
pinguthe ball, and get down the
ﬁeld,,put him on the first team.

paydirt, and Jones’ pick-up and
proper delivery of Fife's conver-
sion attempt that was fumbled be-
fore the Panther guard could boot,
brought many words of praise
throughout the Stadium.

As for Ralph Fife, his hitherto
all-’round defensive action was
smothered. and muzzled by the Hig-
ginsmen, as per previously well-
practiced plan. On almost every
State play, regardless of direction
or purpose, the Panther right-
guard was rendered impotent by
three and even more Lion block-

ers. He took a terriﬁc physical‘
beating. And it was the opinion
of many, as Fife limped to the
locker rooms early in the ﬁnal peri-
od, that there was the real hero of
the game. . 0 i .
Pitt and Penn State had several
things in common. Both the bands
performed exceptionally and equal-
ly well. The Panther and the Lion,
in their respective skins, bore a
very strong resemblance. And the
score board . . . that's where the
resemblance ceased.

But it seems that with each suc-
ceeding week, the Pitt Band be-
comes better and better. The Piano
‘Concerto performed in combination
with the State band, really hit a
peak in halftime offerings. . . . PA
balloon ﬂoat, bearing a picture of
the Penn State coach failed to rise
at the speciﬁed moment, due un-
doubtedly to mathematical miscal-
culations on the part of Lion en-
gineers. Once the gaseous mass
reached the section reserved for
the kids, though, up it went . . .
but quick . . . and in all directions.

Intramural‘ ~%football’s ifliowl game
will be played "this afternoon as
the Punks, undefeated, untied,«and

in the grand ﬁnale of the currentvvi:

campaign. . ;,;.
' Last Friday the Phi Eps man-
aged to squeeze out a victory over
the ' AE&ME seniors, engineering
league kings, I4-6. Thus they
gained the right to meet the Punks

today. \ « 

-  The engineers took the ~opening' I’:
kickoff and started a drive toward ~

the Phi Eps goal line.
Jimmy Deutelbaum intercepted an

AE&ME pass and the drive was,_

stopped. ‘ _ T

The Phi, Eps then ‘ started a
march of their own, that ended up
in_pay dirt, as Deutelbaum passed
to Hal Weissman. Figgy .Dutch
then circled right end to add the
conversion and the seventh point."

Near the endof the period, the

Phi Eps again startedldown the

ﬁeld on a sustained drive which

netted them their second and ﬁnal
tally. The score culminated. a beau-

CARL OLSON
uncovers new star

‘ kind of performances indicative of

Panther and Olson coached teams.
Never in the entire campaign did
the Pitt hill and dale toppers go
down in defeat without giving the
enemy a stiﬁ battle for their
money. . ‘

With Captain John Brosky, lead- A

ing the local harriers, the Olson
boys took their initial setback at
the hands of Michigan State, 21-
34. However‘, the locals earned
praise as William Curtis, an un-
known sophomore, cut the tape in
ﬁrst,’ outrunning more experienced
_ State runners.
Thiswas only the beginning for

    

  

this ﬂashy Pitt spiker “as he cop-

ped his second contest in a qua-
drangular meet at Cleveland with
Hiram, Bethany and Case. The

Olsonmen won top honors’ with a«

low total of 19 points.
‘Next the Jungle Cats invaded

stubborn Army mules who proved
to be too. powerful as they inflict-
ed a 20-35 defeat. The Service
men won the met, but Curtis again
showed his heels to the opposition
and breezed in first in 22:29. ‘lever
in the race did any Mule harrier
threaten to overtake him.

Defeat remained as the locals
dropped their second straight meet
to the crack forces of Coach
“Chick” Werner’s Nittany Lion
spikers. Not only was it disastrous
for the Panthermen, but also to
Bill Curtis, who trailed in, seventh
place. It was his first defeat of the
SQ880IIa

Then followed the all-important
IC4-A meet in New York, which
brought together the outstanding
runners in the country. Panther-
man Curtis placed 44th. Leslie
MacMitche11, victor in the last two
IC4-A classics, garnered his third
national championship, grabbing
first place honors. Rhode Island
State with an all time low of 31
markers won the meet.

“We had a fairly good season
and the boys had to ﬁght all the
way, being pitted against the
toughest teams in the country in
Michigan State, Penn State, and
vArmy,” was the way Coach Ol-
son described the past season.
,“They deserve a great deal of
credit."
MacMitchell the Panther mentor
said, “He’s the best runner in the
world, barring none.”

As soon as the track house is in
condition for practice sessions,
initial track. workouts will begin.
In all probability call for candi-
dates will be issued this week.

~ Having left «the varioussweet
stages that Dr. Carlson had them
in, Pitt’s varsity basketball squad
is down to the serious work of prac-
tice games with local semipro
teams.

Last Tuesday, the Blue and Gold
team beat a squad from Aliquippa,
on the Stadium ﬂoor. Playing

' against the Panthers were Sam Mi-
lanovich of last year's Pitt team,
and Pres Maravich, high point man
for Davis-Elkins last season. '

1 On Thursday, they shellacked

Gulf Reﬁning, 67-38. The entire

first half was played by the team
that is at present the first string
ﬁve. They were Eddie Ziolkowski,

Larry Paffrath, Tay Malarky, Jim-

my Egan, and Bob Artman. ‘

Steve Shuber was the first re-A

serve to enter the game, and then
Carlson substituted freely, until ev-
ery man on the squad had been in
the game. T "

Carlson was in New York earlier
in the week, at a conference con-
cerning the Pan-American games,
which will be played in Buenos
Aires, Argentina, next winter. The
Pan-American games are taking
the place of the Olympic games,
which have been cancelled indef-
initely because of the war in Eu-
rope. ,-

The trip to the Argentina will
take, 18 days each way, and will
provide something new in the way
of athletics in South America. As
far as basketball goes, live college
players will be selected to go, and
five more players under the juris-
diction. of the AAU.

Getting back to basketball at
Pitt, the local season is less than a
month away, and thus far the
showing of the local quintet has

, been very gratifying to Carlson.

, At Thursday’s game, the playing
of Bobby Artman in particular,
was outstanding. He is small for
a basketball player, but doesn’t let
his size «hamper
play. * ~-

La spaaa

By: PAUL PALANZO
 Since our sports section is usu-
ally ﬁlled, with news about football,
basketball, track, or baseball, very
few of our student body here at
Pitt know that we have a riﬂe
team—and a very good one, too.
Now in its fourth week of prac-
tice, the team is shaping into one
of the best ever to represent Pitt.
Coach Sergeant MacDonald seems
to be all smiles’ these days, and
who wouldn’t, when there’s an ex-
pert marksman like Lou La Spada
to captain and,lead the team. La
Spade. has beenthe most consistent
shooter on the team. Last spring
he placed eleventh. in the National
Riﬂes Association matches staged
in Washington, D. C. Practically
every college riﬂe team in the coun-

try participated in the N R A
matches.

i_ . lncidentally, La Spada just miss-
ied being selected on the Golden
Bullets, the official All-American
rifle team, which consists of the
ten best marksman in the country,_
The riflemen are divided into
two units, the Varsity and the R
OTC. The boys have been prac-
ticing daily, from I to 4 in the "aft-
ernoon, under‘ the ‘Pitt stadium.
With 22 caliber riﬂes, the boys
aim at a bull’s eye, ﬁfty feet away.
A. perfect shot is made only twlien
one-hits the sma'1l,spot in the.cen-
terof the"eye, and the diameter of
this spot is lonly'157100 of an inch.

matches. ’
Two boys who have been valu-
able to Sgt. MacDonald in shaping
up the team are Head Manager
Vince Matera, and his assistan
Dick Stein. — /

“Some people think there is
nothing to this sport,” said’~Sgl°;,
MacDonald, “but Pd like them’ 
know that it takes more pr-actiee_,
and guts than any other ‘sports.
And it's much tougher than hunts
ing.” 

Eighteen sophomores are make-
ing strong bids for positions on the;
varsity squad, starting its schedule’
of matches early in January. 2

Sergeant MacDonald ’believ M
that his team will undoubtedlycmsé
ish somewhere on top in the nexﬁ
NRA meet, and also that 
La Spada will break into the A
lect ten marksman of the count
next spring.
