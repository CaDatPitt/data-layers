Police
identify
  murder
Victim

By Marcia Dunn
Associated Press Writer

. , PITTSBURGH (AP) — Enough
body parts have been found and
reassembled to tentatively iden-
. tify at decapitation victim as a city
man% with a checkered past,
police said Wednesday.
”Murder’s always gruesome.
When they decapitate the body
and ‘then dissect it, it becomes
that much more gruesome,” said
Allegheny County Police Su-
perintendent Robert Kroner.

C‘ _ From body parts found in scat-
L ere ‘locations east of Pittsburgh,

authorities have identified the

.victi§m as Anthony Patrick
c Michalowski, a 22-year-old un-

employed Pittsburgh resident.

His head, severed from his
body with a machete or similar
weapon, was found along with a
1.‘/2- to 2-foot piece of large intes-
tine in a plastic garbage bag in a
comljrnercial trash bin behind a
_ hopping center in North Ver-
sailles on Dec. 27.

l — ' The victim had been dead 24

to 48 hours, said coronerjoshua
Perp’er.
The lower jaw had been re-

'moved, apparently to hinder

identification. It was found Tues-
day outside a steel mill several
-miles away in North.Braddock.
A ‘tongue, small intestines and
several strands of hair were found
in tlie plastic garbage bag with
the javv.
_AU_’thorities believe the body
pieces came from the same body
and are testing them for confir-

in Whitaker, across the Monon-
gahela River from North Brad-
dock. Lab tests determined the
lung and head came from the
same body. '

T he coroner's staff stitched the
lower jaw and lip to the head on
'Tuesday', allowing police to dis-

Navy shoots down Libyan fighter planes

By Norman Black
AP Military Writer-
WASHINGTON (AP) ~. U.S.
Navy‘ jet fighters shot down two
Libyan MiG-23 jets Wednesday
after the Americans were ap-
proached at high speed in what
Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci called ”a hostile man-
ner” in international airspace
over the Mediterranean Sea.
Carlucci said the two American
E-14 Tomcat jets acted solely in
self-defense. Based on prelimi-
nary reports, the Soviet-built Lib-
yan jets activated their

weapon-targeting radar before

the U.S. jets opened fire with
their air-to-air missiles, he said.

Carlucci denied that the'jets,
assigned to the aircraft carrier
USS John F. Kennedy, were air-
borne to participate in a military
strike on a disputed chemical
weapons production plant inside
Libya.

He said the carrier was only
crossing the Mediterranean
toward a port call and conduct-
ing routine operations when the

incident occurred at midday lo-
cal time, about 5 a.m. EST.
The U.S. planes, each carrying
two crewmen, returned without
incident to their carrier‘and were
then flown to Naples, Italy, for
debriefing, Carlucci said. The fate

of the two Libyan pilots remained _

unclear, although he said ”two
parachutes were sighted” and a
rescue helicopter was later seen
in the area.

It was the first military confron-
tation between the United States
and Libya since a U.S. bombing
raid over Tripoli in 1986. That
raid came after the Reagan ad-
ministration said it had conclu-
sive evidence that Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi was behind a

.terrorist bombing attack in West

Germany;

President Reagan, on vacation
in Los Angeles, was awakened
about an hour after the downing
and told of the incident by Lt.
Gen. Colin L. Powell, his nation-
al security adviser, in a phone
call, said White House spokes-
man Roman Popadiuk.

The spokesman said he had no

information on Reagan's reac-
tion, except to say that the presi-
dent ”considers the incident
closed.”

In Washingtonat a Pentagon
briefing, Carlucci echoed that:
”We now consider this matter
closed.” ’

Libya's Foreign Ministry called
it a ”premeditated attack” by U.S.
forces and said it would seek an
emergency meeting of the U.N.
Security Council.

President-elect Bush was told
of the incident by phone at 6 a.m.
Wednesday by the White House
situation room, according to
spokeswoman Sheila Tate. ”He’s
being kept informed” throughout
the day, she added.

Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-
Ga., said the U.S. jets were act-
ing defensively and the Libyan
planes ”had maneuvered them-
selves into a position of attack —
and they did_ it on two oc-
casions.”

”That violates the rules of en-
gagement that we have common
understanding on in the interna-

tional environment,” Nunn said.
”You cannot, in this day and time
and [with] modern technology,
wait until another plane has fired
in order to defend yourself. It's
too late then.”

Senate Republican Leader Bob
Dale of Kansas said the downing
appeared to be ”self-defense -
pure and simple.”

Gadhafi ”never learns,” Dole
said. ”Maybe this time he will fi-
nally get it straight: Whenever he
threatens American forces, we
will defend ourselves.”

The incident occurred well off-

the Libyan coast in international
airspace, Carlucci said. The air-
craft carrier was about 127 miles
north of Tobruk, Libya, while the
two F-145 were about 70 miles
north of the coast. 4

In Rome, Libya's ambassador
to Italy, Abdel Rahman Shalgam,
called Wednesday's incident ”a
unilateral act” and a dangerous
action. He declined to say how
Libya would respond.

Number of reported AIDS cases drops in 1988

part a schedule of three human *
rights conferences, including a
1991 session in Moscow, the
White
yesterday.

HARRISBURG (AP) - About
530 new AIDS cases were report-
ed in 1988, 150 less than the
previous year, but the lower to-
tals do not represent a slowing in
the spread of the deadly disease,
the state Health Department said
Wednesday.

”Those '88 figures are very in-
conclusive right now,” said
department spokesman Bruce
Reimer. ”We will be adding to
those figures through 1989.”

In 1988, 528 new AIDS cases
were reported compared to 678
in 1987, Reimer said. The disease
attacks the immune system and
makes the victim powerless to
fight off illness.

Although the figures give the
impression that the number of
cases is dropping, they actually
reflect a lag in the time between
a case diagnosis and the actual
reporting of the case to the
department, Reimer said.

In fact, physicians are predict-
ing AIDS cases in Pennsylvania
will double in coming years, he
said.

”Those predictions are based
mainly on national projections

because we here in Pennsylvania
are pretty closely paralleling what
we're seeing nationwide,” Reim-
er said.

Health officials estimate there
are some 60,000 Pennsylvania
residents currently carrying the
AIDS virus who have not yet
been diagnosed with the disease.

Hyatt Hotel incident

PITTSBURGH (AP) ~ City offi-

operators of a major hotel why
firefighters were not called im-
mediately to battle a ceiling fire
that was extinguished by work-

sitate an evacuation.

City firemen were called to the
second fire, but not the first.

Deputy Fire Chief Eugene Tho-
mas said Wednesday that had the
smoldering fire gone undetected
a disaster could have resulted at
the Hyatt Hotel in downtown
Pittsburgh.

 must be strong

when facing Libya

In the wake of yesterday's shooting of two Libyan jet
fighters, the United States once again faces criticism from
its allies for allegedly flexing too much of its muscle. Some-
body, however, has got to do it.

Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci denies that the Unit-

ed States had the intent of destroying a Libyan chemical .

weapons factory and said he considers ”this matter
closed.” Unfortunately, Libyan leader Moammar Gadha—
fi’s vow to ”meet challenge with challenge” creates more
avenues of terrorism which the United States must face.

Libya claims that its chemical plant will only produce
pharmaceuticals. Gadhafi, however, has been known to

lie.

Chemical weapon development is becoming more
prevalent in Middle Eastern countries. Syria, Israel, Iran,
Iraq, Egypt, North Korea and Vietnam reportedly have
chemical weapons. In such a militarily unstable area,‘
Libya's chemical plant poses a dangerous threat to U.S.
and world security. A half-dozen chemical bombs could

- destroy life in a half-mile square, and the United States

should be concerned when such power is available to a

lunatic like Cadhafi.

President Reagan should seriously consider destroying
Libya's chemical plant unless conclusive evidence can be
found that Libya is telling the truth. I

The United States appears to be acting like an abusive
parent torward Libya. Yet, when Gadhafi/s behavior
reflects that of a disturbed child, what else can we do?

Spontaneous human combustion and a car's revenge

Those of you who are fans and
followers of my columns, and
those of you with nothing better
to do during classes, will proba-
bly remember the delightfully
witty tale about my car that was
printed last September. Well, my
'68 Oldsmobile, in a spiteful fit
owing to its perception of mis-
treatment by me with a six-pack
of Coke, got its revenge over the
past holidays, but not in a man-
ner you'd expect.

Allow me to explain (since it's
the first day of classes, it's not like
you have anything better to do).

The car, wondering which day
woulldl be best to begin its
revenge, waited until the day be-
fore Christmas. It was just after
dinner, and I was standing in the
kitchen chatting with my Aunt Pat
and several other relatives who,
like me, were waiting for the next
pot of coffee to finish brewing.

”Fire!” my Aunt Pat shouted in
a not-too-loud voice. I, quickly
looked around the kitchen, but
determined that there actually
was no fire.

”Fire!” echoed my cousin-in-
law, Wes. Still, I saw no fire.

”You’re on fire, Will,” Aunt Pat

said loudly, putting down a cup
and rushing toward me. I rapidly
checked myself out, determining
that there was no fire on me and
informed all the people in the
room that they must be joking.
Mom had now entered the
room and joined in the chant,
”You’re on fire, Will; turn
around.” I informed my mother
that I wasn't on fire, but by this
time it was too late. I was quick-
ly seized, spun around and
repeatedly slapped on the back
until everyone was convinced
that I was no longer on fire.
"Jesus, Will, how did your
sweater catch fire?” Mom said,
directing my attention to a pile of
ash on the floor at my feet. No
clue on my part, just one sweat-
er with a gaping hole in the back.
There was an odd, sinister
laugh from the driveway, but
when I opened the front door, it
stopped. Several days later (the
day after Christmas, to be exact),
I drove back to Oakland from
Erie. Having made a stop at a
friend's house on the way (you all
remember the evil Jeff from the
previous car story), I didn't get to
my apartment until about three in

the morning.

Not wanting to make several
trips up and down the block from
my apartment to the car, I decid-
ed to undergo the herculean task

, of carrying all my luggage and

Christmas booty in one shot. This
task completed, I deposited
everything at the foot of my door
and stuck my key into the shiny
brass hardwareon my front door.

WILLIAM
YOUNG

Then lthought, Wait a minute,
I don't have a shiny brass lock
and doorknob.

But there it was, a new lock on
my front door and no key to open
it. Pausing for a second, I waited
to hear Rod Serling’s voice. No
dice. I decided to try my key
again. Nope. Then I knocked on
the door. Zilch.

I was contemplating getting an- ‘

gry and throwing a temper tan-
trum when I remembered
something: my apartment had
been broken into before. Well, I
thought, if some -high—schoo|
twerp can get into my apartment

when it's locked, so can I.

I was standing on the the ledge
outside my bedroom window, fu-
tilely trying to force the window
open, when I spied ’a police car
stopped at the intersection 20
yards away from me. I looked
over my left shoulder for a sec-
ond, wondering if the City Police

A were going to put me up for the
’ night, when the police car drove

away. Yes, the city's finest were
certainly out there questioning
suspicious people trying to force
windows open.

After retrieving a crowbar from
my car and gently forcing a win-
dow open, I discovered my new
key on my dresser.

The car, now angry that I had
gotten out of two of its well-laid
traps, decided that it would try
once more.

Around 7 p.m. on New Year's
Eve, I was heading back to my
apartment with a friend to begin
pre-celebrating. Within a mile of
my apartment, as I waited patient-
Iy at a red light, smoke rose slow-
Iy from my hood and my

electrical system shorted out. Af-
ter performing the limited
amount of troubleshooting I
knew (turningthe car off and then
back on, hoping everything
would be “back to normal), I
decided to just head back to the
apartment and continue with the
evening.

Several days later, my grandpa
(the Mr. Fix-It from the Septem-
ber story) arrived on the scene to
set things alright. Diagnosing the
malady as an undercharged bat-
tery, he soon alleviated the
problem. The electrical system
was once again working, and I
bid Grandpa adios.

The car, however, was pre-
pared for just such a situation.
That night, as I hopped into my
car for a night of solace at the
cinema, the electrical system re-
fused to work. Instead of the mo-
vies, I had to content myself with
a short trudge to Chief's Cafe and
conversation with a loon.

Leading this holiday’s pack of
”serious” films is Rain Man.
There are a few moments when
the movie flirts with trancelike
near-enchantment, with gorgeous
landscapes and engaging work by
superstars Dustin Hoffman and
Tom Cruise. But the film be-
comes little more than a vehicle
for the two stars and ultimately
runs out of gas.

Dustin Hoffman's much—hyped

“performance is a reminder that
the most memorable acting jobs
are accompanied by excellent
movies.

Charlie Babbit (Tom Cruise), a
car dealer, finds out his estranged

.. ..
. . - o --
. .

   

father has died. The father left
millions to Charlie's older
brother, Raymond (Dustin Hoff-
man), whom Charlie never knew.
Charlie initially kidnaps Ray-
mond to ”get back” at the dad he
hates and maybe win some
money in court. But after a week
on the road together, the two be-
come pretty chummy and Charlie
”makes a connection” with his
long lost brother.

The storyline has a tendency to
be loopy and sensational.

There's a subplot about Charlie's
financial troubles that feels pho-
ny from the get-go. It's so hard to
care about the storyline, you be-
gin to wonder how much atten-
tion the filmmakers gave it.

Director Barry Levinson has

: find that even when Cruise is at

 

captured some great ensemble
acting in the past, namely every
inch of his breakthrough Diner.
He does come up with a few
touching scenes here, particular-
ly Raymond dancing with

Charl-ie’s girlfriend (Valeria
Golino).
But the film feels glossy and

overwrought, which undermines

y the intensity of the acting. Also,

Levinson has a weakness for syn-
thesizers. When Hoffman’s Ray-
mond has a crisis, Levinson kicks
in the sentimental wah—wah pe-
dal and kills the scene. _
As for Cruise, well, you can't
say he doesn't try. But he's still
trying to coast by on the slick, air-
head charm of his blockbusters.
He butchers most of his mono-

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, January 5, T989

 logues and bungles crucial mo-

ments. As in Color of Money, we

 his best, his girlfriend (Golino)

ff can steal most of their scenes.

It will be interesting to see

 where Cruise's career goes in the
'j;"_:§ next decade. Part of the problem
' is he still looks like a kid. His

screen presence is purely adoles-
cent. And that's okay at the be-
ginning of Rain Man, where he
is supposed to be an overgrown
adolescent.

But his character must under-
go extraordinary emotional
growth, and Cruise is unconvinc-
ing. At the end of the film, he
seems more like an adolescent
toying with the serious situations
he faces. ’

If boyishness is Cruise's curse,
it has always been Hoffman's
blessing (one of many). I don't
know if the script was tailored for

Hoffman. Maybe it's just a coin-

cidence that Raymond, the
repressed autistic genius, seems
like a culmination of the vulner-
ability that streaks through The
Craduate, Marathon Man and

Hoffman's other great roles.
Hoffman's performance is im-
pressive in the same way a well-
made chair is: You can gasp over
its craftsmanship and finishing.
Like Tootsie, Rain Man uses Hoff-
man's abilities to elicit a maxi-
mum ,response from the
audience. (You can just hear peo-
ple muttering, ”Boy, that Dustin
Hoffman sure can act!” in movie

theaters all over America.)

The script soon gets so bogged
down in Hoffman's acrobatics
that it's difficult to filter the brilli-
ance from superfluous gimmick-
ry. As a result, the story in Rain
Man never fully comes to life. In-
stead, Hoffman's stunt becomes
the center of attention.

Rain Man is an example of
what Hollywood considers a
good movie these days. Every
once in a while, mainstream
moviemaking decides to throw a
bone to sullen pop critics and
other assorted pseudo-anti-
philistines. Rain Man carries
more weight than most of what's

floating down the gutter, but‘

don't expect it to cling to you.

Carnegie International

By Kathy Condit
Staff Writer

The Carnegie International, a
world—famous exhibit of the best
in avant—garde art, is on display
now through Jan. 22 at the Car—

. negie Museum of Art.

The 1988 International is the
latest in-a series endowed by An-
drew Carnegie in 1896. As a
triennial exhibit, the Internation-

al was designed to educate its au-
diences and to make the City of
Pittsburgh more prominent in the
art world.

This year's International
achieves both goals. it is an ex-
cellent way to experience art and
artists rarely seen outside the
world's art hot spots. The Interna-
tional has also brought attention

' to Pittsburgh, since this year's

show has provoked mixed reac-

tions from the art press and
critics.

The 1988 Carnegie Internation-
al features 100 recent or special-
ly created works by 39 artists
from Europe and America. The
exhibition reflects the diversity of
artistic achievement during the
late 1980s but also includes
works by well—known modern ar-
tistssuch as Richard Artschwager,

Beware of The Blob! Thirty years ago. the creeping, leap-

ing menace was captured by the U.S. Armed Forces and
banished to outer space. Now, in the remake of the original
'50s camp classic. it's back as an exploding force of evil that
overwhelms its victims with unspeakable fear. State-of-the-art
technology adds to the impact of this shocking contemporary
horror story that unleashes The Blob on a whole new genera-
tion of unsuspecting moviegoers!

  Carnegie International

Continued from page 7
Anselm Kiefer and Robert
Ryman.

Newer artists are showcased,
along with a memorial exhibition
of works by Joseph Beuys and
Andy Warhol.

The majority of artists are
represented by three to five
works, most on display for the
first time. Some artists have creat-
ed large installations or site-

- specific works expressly for the
International. The works
represent a variety of media: pl'IO—
tography, painting, video, sculp-
ture and more.

”The Sleep of Reason” by Bill
Viola and ”The Way Things Co,”

are two of the more interesting
works in the 1988 Carnegie lnter-

_ national.

These works stand out from the
others in the International be-
cause they use cinematography
to create art. As video and film,
these works were created in a
medium new to art in our centu-
ry: one that incorporates modern
technology, captures the dimen-

peaceful, controlled aspects of
sleep and the uncontrollable,
even violent quality of the dream
state.

The work is site-specific: an en-
closed room outfitted with video
projectors and a special sound
system. During the ’’sleep’’
phase, the room is empty except
for an ordinary bureau covered
with household knickknacks and
a TV. On the TV is the image of
a sleeping person.

At random intervals, the room
goes dark, and identical color im-
ages are projected onto the blank
walls. Footage of forests, skele-
tons, tunnels, fires and frightened
animals passes quickly across the
walls.

After a brief period, the lights
go up, and the sleeper becomes

the focus of attention once more-

This irrational process continually
repeats, using randomly generat-
ed and timed images.

This ”dream” phase, in con-
trast to the ”sleep” phase, puts
the viewer at the center of the
work. Images surround the view-
er on three sides, while blaring
sound assaults the ears. The view-
er is thus enclosed in the work of
art. _

This work is interesting be-
cause of its ability to involve and
surround the viewer in the art it-
self. It uses video and audio
stimuli to create a sensory over-
load that startles and shocks.

The intense imagery creates
scenes of mortality, confusion,
and disaster. The uncontroled
random dream images force the
viewer to submit to the artwork
instead of choosing the level of
involvement. ”The Sleep of Rea-
son” succeeds by removing logic,
control and calm, by putting
”reason to sleep” in the awake
viewer.

”The Way Things Go,” by Ger-
man artists Peter Fischli
David Weiss, is an amusing
avant—garde film studying the ef-
fects of physical and chemical
forces on ordinary household
items.

The film begins with a sharp fo-
cus on a field of rippling black
plastic. As the ripples slowly
twist, the camera pulls back un-
til a garbage bag is seen unwind-
ing from a rope. When it finally
falls and strikes a tire, the action
takes off in a burst of momentum.

In one gigantic, domino—effect
sequence, tires collide, bottles
spill, sugar melts, liquids react
and foam, firecrackers explode,
chairs tip and newspapers burn.

In ”The Way Things Go,” the
artists successfully appeal to the
emotions and the intellect. The
film creates a feeling of unres-
trained childish creativity. Its se-
quence of reactions is like a
child's domino chain, while in-

The Rolling Stone year of 1988 in review

January
The annual Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame induction dinner, held
on Jan. 20, 1988, at New York's
Waldorf—Astoria, offered nostal-
gia, controversy and great music.
Five artists — Dylan, the Beach

the Supremes, —- were inducted; _

Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie and
Les Paul were honored as musi-
cal forefathers; and Motown
Records founder Berry Gordy Jr.
was inducted as a nonperforming
professional.

While inducting the Beatles,
Jagger recalled his envy the first
time he saw ”the four headed
monster. They had on these
beautiful long, black trench coats.
I could really die for one of those.
And I thought, ’Even if I have to
learn how to write songs, l’m
gonna get this.’ ”

There was no sympathy for the
‘plaintiff when Mick Jagger was
accused of plagiarism. Patrick Al-
ley, a reggae singer from the
Bronx, alleged that ”Just Another
Night,” the hit single from Jag-
ger’s 1985. album She's The Boss,
was based on his own ”Just
Another Night,” released in
1983. A six-person jury in White
Plains, N.Y., dismissed A|ley’s
copyright—infringement suit.

But the trial may have done ir-I
reparable damage to Jagger's
reputation. When Al|ey’s attorney
asked him whether he could have
heard A|ley’s song on the radio,
Mick admitted that’he usually
listens to classical music in the
morning. That pretty much bears
out what Keith Richards has been
saying for the past two years.’

Whether it was a concession to
his fans, a retort to the growing
ranks of Led Zeppelin imitators or

_ just a mature recognition of his

legacy, Robert Plant included a

healthy serving of classic Zep
songs in his solo tour this time
around. Among the selections
were ”Misty Mountain,” ”In The
Evening,” ”Heartbreaker” and
”Trampled Under Foot.”

Rock music gained a cool new
band from a cool old place when
the Sugarcubes released -their first
American album, Life's Too
Good. This Icelandic group com-
bined vintage New Wave

I rhythms with biting guitars and

plenty of bratty attitude on the al-
bum and on their first U.S. tour.

Singer Bjork Gudmundsdottir
looks like a schoolgirl, but she
sings with stunning range and
control.

The Sugarcubes’ other singer,
Einar Corn, regularly disrupted
their concerts with bad jokes,
taunts at the audience and solos
on his pocket trumpet. ”He|lo,

Tokyo,” he said during the

Cubes’ first New York show, at
the World. ”Hello, Tokyo. Hel-
lo, Tokyo.” It went on like that for
more than an hour. ”We’re not
professional musicians,” Einar
told one interviewer, and isn't
that a nice change?

Although the Nelson Mandela
Freedomfest, at London's Wem—
bley Stadium, was held in honor
of the imprisoned South African
anti—aparthied activist and head of
the outlawed ‘African National

lighter on political speeches than
on rock ’n’ roll. Nonetheless, the
artists managed to convey their
message through the music.

‘Orange Crushed

Panthers upset host Syracuse, 81-76, in BigEast opener

By John Enright

The Pitt News

SYRACUSE, N.Y. — This was a
‘game Pitt wasn't expected to win.
After all, how many times did
Paul Evans think he could march
his Panthers into the Carrier
Dome, Syracuse's battleground
replete with 28,152 screaming
orangeclad fans, and come out
with a win? . ‘‘

Before last night's Pitt-Syracuse
game, Evans had done it three
straight times — once with Navy
in the 1986 NCAA Tournament
and twice with Pitt, including last

8 year's Big East regular season,

title-clinching 85-84 victory.

But Evans’ success .in upstate
New York was supposed to end.
The Orangemen, ranked second
in the country, were favored by
13 points over a team minus ac-
complished Orange whippers
Charles Smith, Jerome Lane and
Demetreus Gore.

So what happened? The final
score — Pitt 81, Syracuse=76 in
the Big East opener for both
teams.

The loss was Syracuse's first of
the season after 13 consecutive
wins. Pitt improved its record to
7-4.

J3 Maybe it was something in the

Panther’s pregame drink that
made them do things nobody ex-
pected them _to do.

”We drink orange juice with
our pregame meal before every
game here,” said Sean Miller,
Pitt's sophomore point guard
who played the entire 40 minutes
and scored a career-high 22
points.

Whatever the reason, two
things are becoming readily ap-
parent about the Pitt basketball
team. The Panthers don’t lose in
the Carrier Dome and they don't
lose two consecutive games.

Jason Matthews was a key player in Pitt's win last night.

Neither has happened in Evans’
three year tenure at Pitt.

’’I’d like to use (the Carrier-
Dome) ‘as our home court,”
Evans said, ”We do better here
than we do at home.”

Said swingman Darelle Porter,
who scored nine points; ”Before
I left I was telling my girlfriend,
‘You know, we've never lost two
in a row.’ We don't lose two in
a row so I'm glad we kept that
streak alive tonight. Nobody was
thinking of it during the game,
but it's a good streak th have.”

Pitt's win was the result of a
simple game’ plan. The Panthers
got an early lead which they
would never relinquish, gained
confidence, and played tough
defense. Syracuse helped matters
by making only 15 of 35 free

throws (The bricklayers: Stephen
Thompson, 4 for 13, Herman
Harried, 1 for 6, Derrick Cole-
man 5 for 9).

The Orangemen were colder

than the sub-zero temperatures -

outisde the ’Dome. They shot
only 42.6 percent from the field
compared to Pitt's 52 percent.
The Panthers were 24 of 35 from
the line for 68.6 percent. ~

”We’re just not going to be
able to win these kind of games
if we miss 20 free throws,” Syra-
cuse Coach Jim Boeheim said.
”That’s something we have to
continue to work on.

”Pitt played a very solid game
and did the things they had to do
to win. They're very controlled
and they do a good job of getting

the ball down inside. We did a
pretty good job of defending the
inside. Miller hurt us more than
we would like and so did (Jason)
Matthews."

Matthews, the sophomore
shooting guard, finished with 18
points, including two clutch free
throws which extended Pitt's lead
to 71-64 with 4:16 left, and, more
importantly, ended a string of six
missed foul shots by the Panthers.

Despite some anxious mo-
ments down the stretch, Pitt was
able to hang on. Syracuse pulled
to within three points, 71-68,
thanks to two Thompson dunks.
But Porter drove to the left of the
lane and hit a short bank shot
with 3:21 remaining to extend
Pitt's lead to five. The Orange-
men could get no closer.

”There were a few shaky spots
out there but every time they
made a run we countered,” Port-
er said.

Pitt got a strong effort from
center Bobby Martin, who was
coming off a poor performance in
last week's 26-point loss to Ari-
zona in the Fiesta Bowl Champi-
onship. Martin, playing with a
sore back, scored 13 points and
grabbed‘ a career high 13 re-
bounds

Pitt outrebounded the taller
Orangemen 42-41.

”After we lost to Arizona, I felt
pretty bad,” Martin said. ’’I knew
that I was lacking a lot of intensi-
ty and somehow I had to make
up for it.”

Coleman, the Big East's leading
rebounder, blocked three of Mar-
tin's shots early in the game, but
that didn't bother Martin.

”The Lord has given me the ta-
lent to play basketball, and I'm
not going to stop,” Martin said.
”We didn't think if we won it
would be an upset. We came in
here with the attitude that we

Thursday, January 5, T989

were going to come out with a
win.”

It was Martin's turnaround jum-

per that gave Pitt the game’s first
points and the lead it never lost.

After a Brian Shorter tip-in put
the Panthers up 14-10, Syracuse
pulled within one on a Thomp-
son layup. But Pitt went on a 12-3
run highlighted by Matthew's
three—point play, a Shorter dunk
on a feed from Miller and Miller's
first of four three—point field goals,
for a 26-16 lead. Syracuse cut it
to five, 30-25, on a Coleman
coast-to-coast drive. However,
Pitt's 10-3 spurt closed out the
half and gave the Panthers a
40-28 halftime lead which si-
lenced the Orangemen fans.

Syracuse closed to within one
point, 45-44, at 15:50 of the se-
cond half following ‘a 16-5
Orangemen run, but Miller bu-
ried a three-ponter to ensure the
lead.

Coleman led Syracuse with 19
points and 13 rebounds. Thomp-
son and point guard Sherman
Douglas each scored 18.

Another bonus for Pitt was win-
ning while getting only 10 points
from Shorter, Pitt's leading scorer,
who fouled out with 2:07 left and
played only 24 minutes.

Shorter can thank Miller for
picking up the slack.

’’It was a big win for us,” said
Miller, who dished out five as-
sists. ’’I don't know how many
people really believed we could
come up here and win. This
place is a good luck charm for
our team. Last year we came in
and won against the odds. This
year we came in and won against
bigger odds. It seems like when
we come here things fall into
place for us.”

NOTES: Pitt plays Boston College
(7-4, 0-1) Saturday night at Fitz-
gerald Field House.

Modell made big mistake in letting Schottenheimer lea ve

The sudden departure of Marty
Schottenheimer as head coach of
the Cleveland Browns, due to the
coach's ”disagreement in
philosophy” with team owner Art

J Modell paired with the team's re-
cent playoff loss to the Houston
Oilers, calls to mind two similar
situations that occurred in pro
football during the 1980s:

The first deals with the Atlanta
Falcons teams of the late 1970s
and early '80s. _

The head coach of the team
during those years was Leeman
Bennett, the only man ever to
lead the laughingstock Falcons to
the playoffs. Bennett had a talent-
ed squad back then —— William
Andrews, Steve Bartkowski,
Alfred Jenkins and Jeff Van Note
were only some of the stars who
lit up his roster.

Bennett guided his teams into
postseason "action three times
from 1978 through 1982. Didn't
"win any of those matchups -
Dallas and Philadelphia were still
dominating the NFC in those
days — but he at least had the Fal-
cons consistently in the thick of
things.

t

'52...;.1;;¢;a4;u:;:r;:-----;

But ”in the thick of things”
wasn't enough for owner Rankin
Smith Sr. Smith wanted a Super
Bowl trophy, so he axed Bennett
after a 5-4 performance during
the strike season of 1982.

Since the move,«At|anta has
fallen apart entirely.

The other instance came in
1985, the year John Mackovic
directed the Kansas City Chiefs to
their first playoff appearance
since 1971. Mack's Chiefs bowed
to the New York Jets in that wild-
card game, but fairly steady
progress was being made with his
young team.

Yet Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt
fired Mackovic shortly after the
season. Team dissension was his
supposed cause. The players
didn't like Mackovic. They didn't
respect him.

So Hunt hired then-special
teams coach Frank Gansz. The
players liked Gansz. They
respected him. They rallied
around him.

In turn, Gansz took what was
a 10-6 team and transformed it
into a loser. The players now dis-
like Gansz. They dislike losing.

. 1 .-__.-_-‘-.r_‘-_

w«n«qamAaa~m----

At least they were winners with
Mackovic.
Modell, like Hunt and Smith

1 before, won't realize how good

DAIAIIIDDII :1

he had it until a little further
down the road.

What he had in Schottenheim-
er, the NFL Coach of the Year in
1986, was a sharp leader in con-
trol ofhis talented football team.
A coach who had taken the

-Browns to the playoffs’ four

THOMAS
DANYLUK

straight years, including two ap- '

pearances in the AFC Champion-
ship game. A coach who‘
compiled the best record in
Cleveland (46-31) since the high-
ly successful Blanton Collier of
the 19605.

Modell’s reasoning lies in the
fact that Schottenheimer blatant-
ly refused to hire an offensive
coordinator after Lindy lnfante
left the team following the 1987
season.

In 1988, under Schottenheim-
er’s guidance, the offense plum-

...  ,.......,-.._.»......
._._.‘.‘._._._._.;J;,_._;_._,_ 

metted from seventh in the
league to 18th in total yards
gained, 20th to 24th in rushing
yards and third to 19th in points
scored.

”As owner of the club, it's my
responsibility to look to the fu-
ture, not to indulge in the past,”
said Modell. ’’I see two power-
houses rising in Cincinnati and
Houston, and I saw us as almost
treading water.”

But what also needs to be con-
sidered is that Cleveland played
most of the 1988 season without
its best quarterback, its best run-
ning back and its best wide
receiver, as Bernie Kosar, Kevin
Mack and Webster Slaughter
were frequently sidelined
throughout the year with injuries.
A pretty tough scenario.

”Houston lost Warren Moon
for a period,” Modell justified.
”Seattle lost Dave Krieg for a peri-
0d. The Chicago Bears lost Jim
McMahon and Mike Tomczak
and had to, go out and find a quar-
terback from the Arena Football
League.”

Well aside from losing Kosar,
one of the best in the game, the

Browns proceeded to lose back-
up Gary Danielson, then back-
backup Mike Pagel, then back-
back-backup Don Strock.

Lack of consistency behind
center, that's what really stifled
the Browns’ offense this season.

If Modell were going to look for
a weak spot, it was on the
defense. What kept Cleveland
from getting over the hump in
those previous AFC title games
was the inability to stop John El-.
way and Denver's offense — first
it was The Drive in 1986 that
killed the Browns, then it was
Denver's whopping 38 points to

Cleveland's 33 that told the sto- '

ry in the 1987 confrontation.

Nope, Art, it wasn't Schotten-
heimer who kept your gutsy team
out of the Super Bowl. It just
wasn't meant to be this year.
When the injury bug bites, the
thing can bite pretty darn hard.

But if it ain't broken, don't fix
it — that's how the saying goes.
Cleveland wasn't broken. Just
a little beaten up. -
