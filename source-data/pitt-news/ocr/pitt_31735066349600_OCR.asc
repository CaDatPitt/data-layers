The Student Government
Board (SGB) withdrew its en-
dorsement of the Student Coalition
against Tuition Hikes (SCATH) at a

[SCATH meeting in the Student

Union last night.

Dissension prevailed after IFC
representative Rick Siegel propos-
ed a motion for SGB takeover of
SCATH.

. IFC and Pan-Hellenic Society

 inembers lined the walls in support

/2

of SGB. * .

“Before recessing, SGB voted
4-1-2 to take control ‘of SCATH,”
SGB President Barry Weisband
announced.

“If the motion is not approved, .
SGB will withdraw its support of 

SCATH,” Weisband threatened. I

Heated debate of the proposal
ended with SCATH members and
SGB supporters huddled at oppo-
site ends of the room.

“The IFC and Pan-Hel Society
will not endorse SCATH,” IFC
resident Jay McNamara said,
“unless the SGB takes it over.”
' IFC and Pan-Hel members
argued that SCATH needs a
broader power base and funding to
increase its effectiveness.

“I think more can be done by
arbitration with the administration,
than by attacking it, ” Lisa Mattiak,
Pan-Hel spokeswoman explained.
“The SGB has made this one of its
goals."

SCATH members charged that
SGB represents only a fraction of

“Putting SCATH in the hands of

“There are only seven people‘ on

statement "of purpose for the

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The Pennsylvania State Educa-
tion Association (PSEA) has asked
its members to support the Pitt
Professional Union (PPU) in
upcoming union runoff election in
the Provost's area. The statement
came yesterday as a reiteration of
PSEA policy to support any viable
agent in a union runoff election.

“We urge all of our supporters to
work on behalf of collective
bargaining and to vote for the
election of a collective bargaining
agent for the Provost area unit,”
read the one-page announcement
issued by the PSEA organizing
committee.

The March 30 and 31 runoff will
have the PPU and No Representa-
tive on the ballet. PPU won the
Provost area runoff‘ spot in recent
University-wide faculty union elec-
tions by topping the American
Assocaion of University Professors
(AAUP) by 11 votes.

_¢ ost observers have suggested the
PPU will need support from the
other union organizations to defeat

      

option. In the March 9 and 10
election the ’No Representative

option took nearly 48% of all 4

ballots cast.

According to PPU president Van
Beck Hall, the AAUP and PSEA
could join with the PPU in a
bargaining caucus and still main-
tain their structural integrity. The
bargaining caucus, said Hall,
would represent each of the three
unions active in the Provost's area
in a “proportionate equality.”

“If we're going to have effective
collective bargaining, we have to
combine our forces," Hall said.
“No one agent has the overwhelm-
ing majority needed to win the
runoff elections."

“There have been attempts to
combine the unions since last
September," Hall added, “but it’s
clear at this point that somebody
has to glue the thing together."

The AAUP is expected to meet
today or Monday on the issue of
supporting the PPU in the
Provost's area runoff. A

The Student Government
Board (SGB) reevaluated its priori-
ties in the ﬁght against a tuition
hike after its pullout from the
Student Coalition Against Tuition
Hikes (SCATH) last night.

‘The SGB voted to revoke its
endorsement of the coalition
because it did not feel SCATH has

' “A tuition hike seems inevitable,
and I think we should looktoward
minimizing it,” SGB member
Robin Wertkin said. “SCATH’s
orientations are likely to alienate

Nyden Confident He Wi||Winf

BY BILL MOORE

Assistant sociology professor
Paul Nyden is absolutely convinced
he will win the ﬁght to have his
contract renewed, he told reporters
yesterday.

“I have no doubt in my mind we
will win,” he said at a press
conference called by his support-
ers. I

Nyden was critical of the Board
of Trustees, claiming their military-
industrial ties were responsible for
what he termed a heavier emphasis
on research than on teaching.

“Until people truly representa-
tive of western Pennsylvania sit on
the Board, we will not have a truly
democratic university,” he said.

Cooper Takes BAS Election  

. 

BY BILL MOORE ‘

Kevin Cooper won the Black
Action Society (BAS) chairmanship
election with 198 of the 382 votes
cast Wednesday.

Cooper, a sophomore, stressed
bringing together the various black
student groups on campus. “Black
students have the resources to do
just about anything they want to
do. But black students must get
more involved," he said.

He defeated Bill Warren, who

pulled 126 votes, and Lorenzo"

Boone. who garnered 55 votes.
Doug Guy won the election for

. co-chairperson with 324 votes. He ~

was unopposed.

' ‘lilting

He claimed the decision by the
sociology department steering
committee not to renew his contract
was based on strictly political
reasons and had nothing to do with
his ability to teach.

“I feel my academic record is

excellent, my teaching record is
excellent, and my community
service record is excellent,” he
said.

. He said he played no part in
Tuesday's sit-in at the ofﬁce of
sociology department chairman
Burkart Holzner, but added that it
was not until the sit-in that he won
the right to an open hearing.

Other speakers ‘at the press
conference included Lou Antal,

was pleased with his victory. “I
want to thank all of the people who
supported me, and I want to give a
special thanks to all black Greeks. ”

“I think the election went very
well,” he added, “and I look
forward to a very good year next
year.”

A total of 669 students registered
to vote during the BAS registration
drive. A spokesperson for the
election committee attributed the
difference between the number of
students registered and the num-

Hall at Teach-In

 

“Must Pressure Legislature” s

BY DEANNA L. CONGILEO

A tuition hike is inevitable unless
greaterpstudent pressure is exerted
on the state legislature to increase
Pitt’s proposed $59.9 million
appropriation, Pitt Professional
Union president Van Beck Hall said
at Wednesday’s Student Coalition
Against Tuition Hikes (SCATH)

‘Teach-In.

“The Pitt Board of Trustees has
not been able or willing to exert
enough pressure on state legisla-
tors,” Hall said. .

About 100 people attended the

brum, held in the S.U. Ballroom.
Pennsylvania holds a shocking
in higher
education, according to Hall. The
commonwealth ranks fortieth of
ﬁfty states in the percent of its
budget (9%) allocated to higher
education. . ' _

The administration’s represen-
tative, Vice-Chancellor for Budget

?and Planning Jack Freeman,

‘.‘The petition has been circula-
ted with great success, although
there are still some departments
we haven’t reached yet,” UGE
spokesmen Robert Nelson said.
“The petition’ calls for
University to recognize the UGE as
the sole bargaining agent for

fssﬁiaduate student employes and
"’§i1thorizes the UGE to bargain with

  

administrators on terms of em-
ployment.” .

phasizing Pitt’s need for increased
appropriations.

Public opinion, Freeman said,

exerts the greatest influence on a '

legislator’s vote.

“As citizens, we have done an
inadequate job of promoting higher
education, which requires ever-
increasing funds,” Freeman said.
“The University, like every con-
sumer,” is subject to the inﬂation-
ary spiral, and must compensate
for it.” ,

Tuition hikes, Freeman said, do

T not produce much income, relative

to the total" costs of running the
university.

“Last year’s 14% increase
supplied only $2 million of the
$146 ..million total
education budget,” Hall saidin his
presentation. _ .

Several’ speakers suggested con-
centrating University funds on
essential programs. SCATH
member Ann Kelton said ‘there is

too much money wasted on.

arelconsidering hiring a certified
public accountant‘ to review the

, budget.’ ’ - .

SCATH members, some of them
in tears, protested that the SGB has
not labored for the cause", as other
SCATH members have. _

“It’s not right for the SGB to just

i‘ take over,” one SCATH'supporter

said. “We’ve done all the work so
far.” i ‘ -

An SGB supporter demanded a
recount after SCATH members
voted 38-37 against the motion.

opposite sides of the room in order

to demonstrate. their feeling on the

motion. ‘ '

frivolous expenditures, such as

“Extra law facilities and the
bridge across Forbes Avenue were
built for the betterment of the
-University,” Freeman responded.
He added he does not believe
administrative salaries should be
cut to finance facilities like the
Forbes Avenue bridge.

Freeman said the Board of
Trustees has an acute concern for
educational improvements. r

“I am sure any member of the _

advised .SCATH to shift its

interests from long range societal T

concerns ‘’‘to immediate ‘action

is a beginning that may have
happened too late.”

“I did not‘ intend for this to
happen and refuse to go to one side

said. , , '

SGB members then held a closed

Fewer Than 100   —

I It doesn’t say much for students when. fewer than 100 people are
, concerned enough about a likely tuition hike to tLu'n out for the
Teach-In sponsored Wednesday by the Student Coalition Against

Tuition Hikes (SCATH).

SCATH has come under considerable criticism for its reluctance to
get down to facts, but now the student body as a whole must be asked
why they are so reluctant to cooperate with SCATH‘. '

Most of the speakers at the Teach-In offered valuable commentary
on Pitt’s ﬁnancial situation and how it will affect students. For once,
the real issues were directly addressed, but it does little good when no

one is there to listen.

SCATH did an admirable job in coordinating the event and keeping

student aid-—but they are few.

_ the speakers to the point. There were exceptions——those who felt V
‘ obliged to raise personal issues not related to tuition, cutbacks, or

The speakers who were critical of the administration offered some
realistic viewpoints on the present situation and some suggestions for
future actions aimed at halting a hike, and Vice Chancellor for Budget
and Planning Jack Freeman went on the record with some important
clariﬁcations of fact. All in all, most any student stood to beneﬁt from

‘the few. hours it took to attend.

The low turnout is unfortunate, and could easily be the cause of
disillusionment on the part of SCATH supporters, but it sho11ldn’t be.
SCATH must act fast to formulate additional positive efforts for the
preciois few weeks remaining until the term ends. f
' Tuition costs are one area where students stand a chance to have
their voice heard, but only if they are willing to exert themselves and

‘speak clearly and directly.

_ Increased participation in SCATH activities would bea good sign, no
matter where the additional students ‘come from, and SCATH should

continue to work toward that goal.

It is lack of student concern of the sort exhibited at Wednesday’s

handleanother hike. ‘ I

‘Two thousand years ago a King

the darkness. We though that at

light, safe from the truth; here, at
last, we needn’t be confused by
truth—truth that could have made
us free. -

In the March 15, issue of the Pitt

very poorly executed attack on the

contained so little historical truth
as to have possibly been laughable;

Christians have given their lives as
a testimony to the validity of the

the evidence for the resurrection of
Christ warrants serious considera-

tion. In the March 15 article the

period following the death of the
Lord Jesus is called “...the day
that God disappeared.” No, Jack,
He didn't disappear. You and I
rejected Him and ran into our own
version of reality. As for the King,
He still loves us, that never
changes. He still wants to stand
beside us as our friend. Through
the centuries people have called
Him a bastard, a liar, a legend, and
a lunatic. In your article, Jack, you
question the legitimacy of the
King's birth; you even introduce a
law suit in your “fairy tale” version
of the birth of Jesus Christ. In
reality, there was a trail, and the
verdict, “...l ﬁnd no fault in this

__G*uise of Parody

The article by W. Jack Romberg"
which appeared on March 15 was

- one of the most blatant examples of

biased journalism ever to appear on
the pages of your newspaper.
Taking the guise of parody, it was
in reality little more than an
excursion into the realm of
anti-Christian bigotry. Mr. Rom-
berg has taken it upon himself to
heap ridicule and scorn on beliefs
such as the Divinity of Christ and
the Virgin Birth, beliefs which are
held sacred by millions.

Even these who do not subscribe
to these beliefs would agree that
this kind of cavalier mockery of
religion has no place in our society.
One might dismiss this article as
the sophomoric ramblings of an
iconoclast, or as a light-hearted

jest, but sacred doctrine is not a._

 

    

legitimate object of satire, and the
uneasy feeling the reader is left
with tends to dispel the notion that
iconoclastism was the author's sole
purpose.

No, there was a certain degree of
maliciousness which cannot be
tolerated. The First Amendment
guarantees of freedom of speech
and press do not provide a license
for outright blasphemy. For these
reasons we appeal to Mr. Rom-
berg's sense of common decency in
asking‘ him to retract or at least
explain this most unfortunate
article.

The Chancellor Didn’t Hear

BY TOM WASELESKI

SCATH. Say it. SCATH. It even
sounds like a festering sore. "

Seeking to enflame the tuition-
paying hearts of Pitt students, they
have ﬁzzled out like a cigarette butt
hitting toilet water. '

It had seemed like the time for
such a group was ripe. January’s
student government candidates
parroted each other on the
necessity of a broad-based student
coalition to lead the fight in student
issues.

Things were looking good the

, ﬁrst night, with endorsements from
various student ‘groups pouring in ‘

and even more on the way. There
was a wide array of representa-
tives. Commuters, residents,
blacks, Greeks—just about every-
one hada spokesman on hand.

I

IMPRESSION '

Then, amid the inflated breasts
that called this the great coalition
that would provide the necessary
force to make student concerns
heard and heeded over at. the
Cathedral, proposals offered for
adoption into SCA,TH’s statement of
purpose included a 2% educational
tax‘ on all multinational corpora-
tions and the replacement of the
present Board of Trustees with an
all student-faculty board. Sudden-
ly the coalition seemed stacked.

Certainly, depending on to whom
you talk, there exist several
different assessments of SCATH.
The only correct one is the view
that recognizes the “coalition” as a
loosely arranged band of students
who have something against the
administration, whether it is
raising tuition or not.

After attending the “coalition’s”
meetings one gets a very deﬁnite
sense of SCATH types. The typical
SCATH regular is pro-union (on
just about anything), pro-Nyden,
has handed out leaflets, has
circulated petitions, and knows
how to carry a sandwich board
sign.

from readers. Letters for publica-
tion should be typewritten and
include the _writer’s name and
accompanied by signatures. Be-
causepof the large volume of mail
received we regret we are unable to
acknowledge or return unpublished
letters. Due to space limitations the
-PITT NEWS cannot guarantee that
all letters are published.

rThe PITT NEWS welcomes letters‘

Not that there is anything wrong

with what these SCAT H types do,
but their similarity of viewpoints
and activities and their (and they
love this word) solidarity proves
that they‘ are not a coalition of
diverse groups at all, but rather
preachers preaching to the convert-
ed. ' ’

It's a great change for them to
hear thevoices echoing off the high

walls of the Student Union lower

lounge rather than off the tight
confines‘ of cubby-hole offices and
the Militant Bookstore down Fifth
Avenue across from Carlow. ‘

Their biggest consciousness- ,
raising spectacular was Wednes-

day night’s ‘_‘teach-in,” ‘where
seven speakers, eight if you include
the remarks by the moderator,
tried to confront the issue of ‘rising
tuition. .Some apparently were
speaking at thelwrong forum, as
the audience found itself haran-
gued on faculty unionization, the
drive for graduate employes to
unionize, and the case of Dr. Paul
Nyden.

Some, however, were straight-
forward, to the-point, and were not
re-reading addresses previously
delivered at the Young Socialists’
Militant Forum._ V

Take Barry Weisband, for
instance. He said in simple terms
and without quoting any slogans
that SCATH should “alter its scope
from the long-range conversion of
society" to the speciﬁc issue at
hand—rising tuition at Pitt.

Take George Van Hook, for
instance. He made the point and
he made it without banging his ﬁst
even once, that if Pitt’s tuition goes
up,'its aid grants td impoverished
students should go up as they do at
most other schools.

Take ‘Van Beck Hall, for
instance. He recommended that a
concentrated student-faculty-

I administration effort on Harrisburg

take’ place and that University
officials open the budget hearings
to the public the way the city and

county do. And I don’t think. he
even waved a banner.’ ‘

But the SCATH regulars just
seemed to yawn,

the floor for questions to Vice-
Chancellor for Budget and Plan-.
ning Jack Freeman, who was, by
the way, the only speaker that
Redwood invited the audience to

question, they seemed particularly A

concerned with the size of the

pointless, objective that SCATH in
its present form and under its
present “leadership” lost any
potential for effectiveness that it
might have had..

The great majority of  _

students are against rising tuition
but do not espouse the same causes
as SCA'TH’s zealous nuclear
leadership.’ Any» I coalition .of
student groups that plans to
broaden its base of support must be
led by the group with the largest
base and that is the student
government. A handful of Young
Socialist members leading an
entire student body in Pittsburgh,
1976, is like turning a pyramid
upside down and expecting it to
stand on its apex.

A dozen picketers marching,

 Grad Employe-s

9 Oppose ‘Hikes

The ‘University of Pittsburgh
administration has repeatedly in-
sinuated that, in our attempts to

‘secure collective bargaining, the

graduate employees and faculty are
engaged in a conspiracy whereby
we seek salary increases at the
expense of the student body. The
implies that in-

terms and

and
conditions of employment as well

wages, hours

as the inpact thereon.” We can,
however, bargain over matters like
classroom size and teaching loads.

A contract which includes
restrictions on class size and
workload assures the whole Univ-
ersity community that the educa-
tional process will not be adversely
affected by the administration’s
future attempts at'budget-cutting.
Unionization will put graduate
employees on a common ground
with graduate and undergraduate

students in their opposition to

cutbacks.

Our affiliation with the American
Federation of Teachers (AFL/CIO)
provides links with the labor
movement as a whole. Unionized,
we are better able to bring pressure
to bear on the University adminis-
tration and even the state
government over
broad importance to students.

There is no reason why the
interests of graduate employees
and those of the student body must

all workers share in common—the

right to organize and bargain

collectively. But we are also taking
an active part, through our
membership in the Student Coali-
tion Against Tuition Hikes
(SCATH) to fight the hikes and
cutbacks. Neither SCATH nor the
UGE can guarantee a victory in this
struggle, but we can strengthen the
movement by joining together. A
strong union of graduate em-
ployees can be a solid defense
against this and further attacks on
the quality of education at Pitt. We
urge you to support our assertion of
the right to collective bargaining.

We would first like to point out
what is becoming painfully clear to
all students at Pitt: There are
strong indications that a tuition!

l\linety-three percent of the eligible faculty in the Provost area voted in the initial collective
bargaining election on March 9 and 10. A majority, 582 faculty or almost 52%, expressed themselves
in favor of collective bargaining at the University. The Pitt Professional Union received a plurality of
the votes cast for the three union groups. lt will therefore represent faculty sentiment in favor of col-
lective bargaining in the runoff election scheduled for March 30 and 31 against "no representation." It
is important, especially in a situation where the shape of the University's future is at stake and rumors
and misrepresentations abound, that faculty and other concerned members of the University commun-
ity understand exactly what the Pitt Professional Union is and what it is asking for? '

What Is the PiffProfessional Union?

0 PPU is not a labor union that-has come onto the ‘Pitt campus to "organize" faculty. We are
an independent organization of faculty, founded in 1969, who chose to affiliate with the American
Federation of Teachers two years ago in order to get support to push the case for collective bargaining
here. A V i ' ’

0 Our membership includes’ two past Presidents of the University Senate, several past and
present elected members of Senate Council, representatives of the regionalcampus Senates and faculty
that have been prominent in other areas of University governance and scholarship. Approximately half
of our members are tenured; ‘ '

_ 0 Our Constitution guarantees the autonomy of the Pitt Professional Union. It specifies that
all decisions about policy and organization (including contract demands) be made solely by vote of the

one is obliged to join.

0 PPU felt from the start that the achievement of collective bargaining was the main issue and
that this would require the broadest level of faculty unity. Consequently, we have proposed opening
the contract drafting process and negotiations to participation by members. of the AAUP and the

have to be approved by a majority of. thefaculty to take effect.

Owe neither support nor identify with all activities or positions of the American Federation
of Teachers. We do insist, however, that affiliation with a strong national teachers organization like the
AFT and with organized labor in the United States gives faculty powerful support in our need to se-

- cure adequate funding for this University. I I

0 Because graduate employees share with faculty the teaching and research mission of the Uni-
versity, the PPU welcomes them as members and supports collective bargaining for them. It is impor-
tant to not that the graduate employees have their own organization, the Union of Graduate Em-
ployees, which is autonomous from the faculty organization. Graduate employees do not make policy

campaign. :

0 Many people who oppose faculty unionization claim that under ACT 195 collective bargain.-
ing can only cover issues touching directly on wages, hours, and conditions of employment and would
leave all other matters up to the perogative of the administration. This has simply not been the case
where faculty unions have beenformed either in Pennsylvania or in" other states. Not that the PPU has
any objection to faculty negotiation on matters of salary, etc.; indeed we intend to pursue them as
effectively as possible. But we also see collective bargaining as a means to tackle the whole range of
problems—libraries, governance, tenure, professional development, etc.—that confront us as a faculty. .

Let Horses Be Individuals

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The rider, in full equestrienne
dress, and the prancing dark brown
gelding appeared to be ready for a
fox hunt, so imagine the surprise of
bystanders and PAT bus passen-
gers when they chose for thin; trot
a place in the muddy Student Union
lawn instead of some tranquil ﬁeld
in the countryside.

What was happening was the
ﬁnal part of a program on the

’ Robert O. Mayer Riding ‘Academy.

The focus was on dressage——a

training
It is the
method used by the Mayer
Academy and its purpose is “to
create an athletic balance, a
supple, obedient horse.”

Mayer himself opened the
program in the S.U. lower lounge
with a lecture entitled “Horse
Instincts and Psychology as Ap-
plied in Dressage Riding.

“The horse has a brain,” he
began. “I’m convinced it has the
same rights as we do. We (must let
him bean individual. We train him
so he thinks he’s doing what he
wants to do.” _

Mayer is a member of Federation

Q/"‘§I_>Iationale ...of Germany, was a

British Horse , Society instructor
and teacher in the Spanish Riding
School of Vienna, home of the
Royal Lipizon Stallions.

“Our first aim is to reproduce
the horse in his natural gaits in
such a fashion that he’d want to be
running,”.Mayer continued. “The
idea is to train the muscles in such
a fashion that the horse is able to
carry weight.”

Equestrienne Victoria Patterson prances Dark Thistle across the S.U.

lawn. '

Mayer frequently turned to
diagrams of horses to illustrate
various positions in different
stages.

Next on the agenda was a film on
the Lipizon Stallions, the epitomy
of Baroque dressage. 5 Dressage
can be classified in two major
categories—exhibition (like the
Lipizons) and competition (like the
Olympics). All of it is based on
centuries-old training methods. '

FIDELITY LAW STRICKEN

DOYLESTOWN, PA. (AP)——A
Common Pleas Court Judge has
struck down the century-old right
of a husband to sue his wifegs
lover for damages because, the
judge ruled, a woman is entitled to
choose her sexual partner.

“The principle that one person
has a cause for action for money
damages against- another arising
out of his spouse’s voluntary...
sexual activity with another person
is abhorrent and repugnant to
modern standards," Judge Isaac S.
Garb of Bucks County Court said
Wednesday.

After a 45-minute talk came what
everyone had been waiting for-
the live demonstration.

Victoria Patterson and her horse,
Dark Thistle, put on an exhibition
of dressage riding, going from the
basics to feats made especially
difficult by the slippery lawn.

The horse is “aged”, according
to owner Patterson. “He’s around
13 years old,” she explained.
“Anything over eight years is
considered aged." ’

Patterson, who has owned Dark
Thistle for eight years,. originally
trained him as a hunter-jumper.
Dressage training, through Mayer,
began about four years ago.

Dark Thistle, a mixed breed of
thoroughbred and perchperon heri-
tage, has competed at the
international level.-

Crew Cuts and Grease    
Give Way To Stylists  

BY DREW PDRVAZNIK
_ The late President John Ken-
nedy marked a new breed of
politician. He represented change
and had charisma and youth. He
also was the ﬁrst to popularize the’
‘dry-look’ and longer hair.

So say Gus Corso and Dave
Thompson, stylists at Corso's Hair
People on Oakland Avenue.

“Before any public appearances,
Kennedy had a man do his hair and
make-up,” Thompson explained.
“When the public saw Kennedy,
his features were perfect and he
looked damn good. I think the
change in men’s hair styles began
with Kennedy. Then, in the mid
60s, the Beatles started the look
with really long hair.’_’

“Men are now more conscious o -

their hair, and they care’ for their
hair more,” Corso added.

“Even barbers are now putting
their money made from cutting hair
back into learning more about
cutting and styling,” Thompson
said.

When Corso ﬁrst entered the
tonsorial business 15 years ago,
crew cuts, ﬂat tops and “lvy
leagues” were in vogue. Then, he
gave 35 flat tops a day. Corso says
he still gives a few.

A few years ago Corso started to

   

cut women's hair, too. Now women , ' 
comprise one-third of his business. I '

Corso estimates 80% of his

customers are Pitt students and I 
their hair gets styled and cut every . . 
4-8 weeks, depending on how long, i 

they wear the hair.‘ Corso also

claims business is better than ever,..- .. 

though it hasn’t always been that

way. In the late 60s when people,» '" 
particularly students, wore their 1  
hair very long and uncut, Corso's  
shop almost went out of business. 
Now that most . people ar._e~ ..

conscientious about how their hair;

looks, they are paying more   

attention to caring for it, Thompson
said.

you need is a shampoo that is.

scientifically balanced that won't’, I 55

harm your hair or coat it."

A In addition to bad shampoo, hair
stylers with attached brushes also
damage the hair, according to

Thompson. “The 1,000 watts of»' ﬁn

heat from the blowers dry out your

hair, cause breakage and can burn 
the hair. A way to solve this-'-“'79

problem is to get the heat away by.
holding just the blower without any

attachments in one hand and an ; ‘A 

ordinary brush in the other hand.”‘

c The above is just one ofthe 250
‘V messages that Pitt's Amateur
0 Radio Association (ARA) has
received from Pitt students and
.,sent to places across the United
States in the past two weeks, and it
‘describes rather accurately the
- ' service which the ARA will provide
 at no charge to any Pitt student.

The ARA can send the messages
v for no charge, as is mandated by
l federal law, because the message
travels most of its journey as a
series of dots and dashes emana-
. ting from a Morse Code transmitter
” L at the ARA’s office in 326 S.U.
V .- . The message is received and
». '0 decoded by a ham operator located
i . near its destination. The operator
_ then makes a local phone call to the
,_ _ message's recipient and delivers
 the message.

The entire process usually takes
, ' = less than 48 hours.

“We exist as a public service
organization,” ARA president
 Sandy Silverberg said. “The creed
  .. “of amateur radio is to be of public

‘ ‘service and promote goodwill
‘between countries,” said Silver-
berg,‘ “and we think maintaining
this message service is one way to
serve thetstudents."

Silverberg, in his second year as
* ARA president, presides over a
' _, club which currently has 32 active
’ members, but did not receive any
_ ' funds from the Student Govern-

“We were told by Student
Government last year that if we
needed money, we could sell off
some of our equipment,” Silver-
berg said. ‘

Silverberg noted the equipment
that was sold by the club to finance
operations was not purchased with
Student Government funds, but

' was donated to the club by former

Pitt chancellor Edward H. Litch-
ﬁeld. '

“We’re operating on a shoe.-
string this year,” said Silverberg,
“but we’ve been working remark-
ably well considering.”

The institution of the message
service could work in the ARA’s
favor when it presents its request
for some $3,000 in funds ‘from
Allocations.

Club members spend from two to
three hours each night sending and
receiving messages for Pitt stu-
dents. '

Operating with the call letters
W3YI, the ARA has been in contact
with fellow “hammers” from 35,
states and 200 countries. '

Another service- offered by the
ARA is that of “phone patching,”.
whereby students can speak,
without charge, to anyone, any-
where in the country. The ARA’
contacts someone in the general"
area of the call’s destination, and
then “patches” the , stu-
dent’s voice into a local telephone
call dialed by the other operator.

Recently, the club performed
this service for crewmembers of a

'ship in the Arctic who wanted to

speak with families in the U.S.

Among future projects scheduled
by the ARA is a scheduled chat
with Sen. Barry Goldwater, another
amateur radio operator, via satel-
lite that will coincide with the
NASA-Student Union Board space
exhibition to be held in the Student
Union April 4-7.

He also said there is a direct
correlation between diet, drugs and
hair. For example, the spices, oils
and Vinegars associated with

Italian foods leave secretions on the '

hair that effect the way it looks and
lays. Likewise, aspirin, antibiotics
and drugs like pot leave coatings on
the hair. ' ’'

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The walls of the room are lined
with glittering trophies. It looks
like a jock’s dream world, but none
of the awards were won for athletic
endeavors—-this is the home of the
William Pitt Debating Union.

Believe it or not, the Pitt
debating team had a nationwide
reputation long before Majorized
football put Pitt’s name in Sports
Illustrated. The club, which has
been in existence since before the
turn of the century, last weekend
won its seventh consecutive state
championship.

Most people agree that the
golden age of Pitt debating began
nine years ago when associate
speech professor Dr. Thomas Kane
took over the position of club
advisor.

‘‘I just don’t think you can
estimate how important Dr. Kane
is to the debate team,” freshman
debator James Griffen said. Griffen
will represent Pitt at the district
seven finals along with partner Earl
Creps.

A Kane has a special fondness for
itt’s debating tradition. He is not

only an alumnus of the, University

but also of the debating team.

For the nationwide competition,
the country is divided into nine
districts. Pitt is a member of the
seventh district, along with teams

from New Jersey, Maryland,
Delaware, West Virginia, Virginia,
and the District of Columbia. The
top four teams will go on to
Nationals.

“If we qualify this weekend,
which Ithink we will, Pitt will go to
the Nationals for the seventh
straight year,” Kane said.

“No other team from Pennsyl-
vania has done that.” ‘

Kane speculates that “Pitt
Georgetown, Catholic University,
and West Virginia Wesleyan are
the top four team in district seven,
but like everything else, anything
can happen.”

A formal debate lasts one hour.
Eact participant is allotted ﬁfteen
minutes for initial and summary
speeches. In a competition includ-
ing 60 teams, Pitt will debate eight
times; four times offensively, and
four times defensively. After this,
the top 16 teams are selected. The
first ranked team then takes on
number 16,, second place goes
against the 15th. place ﬁnisher, and
down the line.

‘As a member‘ in Delta Sigma
Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha, the national
debate fraternity, the American
Forensic Association, and the
Debating Assocation of Pennsyl-
vania Colleges, the Pitt team
sponsors a full year of debating
activities which includes intramural
and intercollegiate programs and
35 debates around the country. A
high school program takes visiting

 “Roxy" Interview

- McKay, Best of Both Worlds  

" _Br.1v'1. PATRICK MONAHAN

Sitting quietly in a hardback
chair in his small, cramped suite at
the William Penn Hotel, Roxy
Music horn player Andy McKay

A -5 shattered the image of conceited

L _ Sunday night.
‘ politely ﬁelded questions about his

_; “European decadence” that the
« American rock press has attached
I to Roxy Music.

McKay was winding down slowly

Qfrom a well-received gig ‘at

Carnegie-‘Mellon University last
He calmly and

- . ‘band and solo career and the music

A business in general. His responses

were well thought out, getting
maximum mileage from every
phrase.

“I think that back in 1971, when I
formed Roxy Music with Bryan

(Ferry), Paul (Thompson) and Phil

(Manzera), we had in the back of

’ our minds an’ idea to start a unique
intelligent situation within the-

" . structure of the traditional .rock

group, where solo projects would
_be allowed but not interfere with
Roxy Music,” McKay explained.
‘ McKay has one solo album, In
Search of Eddie Riff, a predomi-
nately sax oriented venture that

, sold well in England, but was never

released in the United States

.  except on an import label. He has

 A1 also done studio work with Mott the

 Hoople, and is currently in the

process of composing a six hour
musical score for an independent
British television station.
“I have the best of both worlds.

I can play with Roxy, musicians
l’ve grown to love and respect,
make a decent living, and still be
able to step outside the context of

Roxy Music with my own projects.

“Other than the Who, Roxy
Music is perhaps the only band
which exhibits this freedom. We
can do our solo bits, then come
back to. the band and concentrate
totally upon Roxy Music.”

When asked about the possibility
of the band breaking up because of
the multitude of solo projects,
McKay cracked a wry smile and

heartily answered:

“Well, as far "as the forseeable
future, which for me is never more
than three months,...no way.
We’re playing too well on this tour
and enjoying ourselves too much.”

Ro_xy has always had a hard-core
following in the United States, and
with the success of their current
album, Siren, and the single “Love
is the Drug,” the American masses
seem to be ﬁnally‘ turning on to
Roxy's sophisticated music.

“This is our longest American‘

tour to date and certainly the best
received. We've opened for
bands such as the Electric Light

'Orchestra and Gary Wright, with

audiences filled with their fans,
played our fifty minute set,
knocked them dead, and ' the
headliners have shown more than a
little reluctance in trying to follow
us,” McKay said.

McKay sets high goals for Roxy.-

“I’d like to see us headlining
some day in New York’s Madison
Square Garden. I’d real-ly love
that.” « '
When quizzed on the so-called
“glamourous rock n’ roll life,”
McKay said, ‘V‘It’s hectic, at least
ﬁnancially it’s a good life. I love to
travel and being in a touring band
is a great way to accomplish this.
But often we can’t go outside of the
hotel, since we're constantly in

“Fish Out Of Water"
Squire Swimmin' Easy

BY TOM WASELESKI

Fish Out Of Water, Chris Squire.
Atlantic Records, SD 18159.

If you’re waiting for that next’

Yes album, wait no more, for this is
it. ‘ *

J Chris Squire, Yes’ specialist~in
the bass department, has _assem-
bled his original material, and with
the accomplished help of other
Yes-men, notably Patrick Moraz on
keyboards and Bill Bruford on
drums, offers what may be the best
album of this young and until now
mediocre year.

Not what you want to call a solo
album at all, Fish Out Of Water is a
good indication of just how much
creative weight Squire carries
around the Yes recording studio.
So you thought Jon Anderson was
the writer/arranger mastermind,
eh?

Squire shows a bit more
discipline in maintaining a traditi-
onal melody, unlike some of Yes’
recent disjointed pieces, i.e.,
“Sound Chaser” from Relayer and
“The Ancient” from Tales from
Topographic Oceans.

The opening cut, listed as two I

songs, "Hold,Out Your Hand” and
“You By My Side,” is actually a

good up-tempo keyboard-bass in,-u

.terplay that moves easily into a
fervent ballad backed by, piano and
a touch of Squire on the old strings.

The vocal in the second half is
strongly "reminiscent of the Beach
Boys’ Holland album. The
nine-minute piece closes with a
heavily orchestrated arrangement
whose major component is a set of
bell-chimes tolling away the
remaining beats of the song.

“Silently Falling” is more
typical Yes fare. Not as
orchestrated, Squire and Bruford.

bounce bass and drum
between each other the way they
did on “The Fish Song,” Squire’s
solo track on the Fragile album.
Moraz goes to town on a keyboard
interlude that could’ve been
swiped from Relayer.

On “Lucky Seven,” there’s more
of that crossﬁre between Squire
and Bruford, leading into a good
sax solo by Mel Collins.

licks

6‘:

“Safe (Canon Song)” is the most A

lavish cut on the album, and
probably the -only place where
Squire encounters any trouble.

The first twelve minutes are sharp?‘

crisp fance-offsbetween bass and
ﬂute, organ and woodwinds, oboe
and bass, and violinand viola.
Squire’s vocal is clear, and pulsates
with the beat of the orchestra.
Suspense builds as new instru-
mentation takes over.

 

 

One can sense‘ the climax
coming. The unfortunate thing is

4

that when it does, its garbled blare, -

a dissonant crashing of synthesizer
and orchestra, is anti-climactic at
best. There is a pleasant synthetic
after-effect, however, that is most
likely intended to convey mysteri-
ous underwater depths.

The blunder on “Safe” detrac
little from the overall quality of‘ the
album, though, and one wonders

'after a few breathless, listening

sessions how soon it will be before

_ the next “real” Yes album comes

along.

‘Fast Annie’ Shallow  

BY TOM WASELESKI

Fast Annie, Annie McLoone.
RCA Records, APL-1362.

‘You've no doubt heard the claim

it won't if the Linda Ronstadt
imitators don’t drop their act.
After all, who are they trying to

stance. During the first listen she

The only song on Fast Annie (I'd  

like to say something profoundly
detrimental about this title but
can’t think,of anything at the

with any degree of justice is Grace
Slick’s “Ai Garimasu (There Is

chorus and only because it’s

. f In the game against West Virginia Jan 7, Tom "Richards suffered an

‘mkle inﬁll’! that ruined his season. —Pitt coach Tim Grgurich called it
the turning ‘point of the season for the Panthers. '

For The Defense,  
Six Shutouts?

BY RON SIEGEL

 

‘ ‘Six Shutouts in 76” reads the labels plastered all over the defensive
coaches’ ﬁlm room at Pitt Stadium. Newly-appointed defensive
coordinator Bob Roper is at a loss as to their origin.

‘‘I don’t know where that came from,” drawled the successor to
Jackie Sherrill. ‘.‘It’s not a defensive slogan for this year. We had ﬁve

‘ shutouts in 1964 at Arkansas (Pitt assistant coach Harry Jones also’
,;.-g,‘ played on that team), but I never _heard of six.” -
‘; T“ Not an expert on Pittfootball history, Roper, like many others, does,
not realize the full extent of past Panther triumphs. Eighteen different
Pitt squads have postedsix or more shutouts in a season. The 1910
Panthers played a nine-game season without being scored upon.

There is little else that concerns Pitt football with which Roper is not
familiar. In his previous three seasons at Pitt, he has coached offensive
receivers and defensive ends, but this year will tutor linebackers, in

addition to assuming his role as defensive coordinator.
_ “I don't anticipate a lot of changes," said Roper. “We lost only
three men, but they were three ﬁne college football players.”

The only starters not returning from the Sun Bowl squad are
defensive end Randy Cozens, linebacker Tom Perko, and. safety Dennis
Moorhead. Cecil Johnson and Ed Willamowski, both of whom saw
plenty of_ action in past seasons, have the inside track on the starting
defensive end positions. ,_

_.g,.;_., Mike Balzer and Larry_Felton are battling for the safety job while Jim
“cw ‘I’ Carmer and Gary Tyra will ﬁght it out for Perko’s linebacker spot.

Roper is trying to convince Majors to try All-East noseguard
candidate Al Romano at linebacker. Majors likes the idea about as
much as he likes Joe Paterno. ‘

“It’s very unlikely A] would line up there the first game of the year,”
said Roper. “Spring is just a time to look and see. It’s the time to
make a silly move.”

The Pitt football team is going places this season, and both the
players and coaches know it. Talk of a national championship does not
seem realistic to Roper. “After four days of practice, we’d be lucky to
beat Carlow College,” he said. “We’ve got a lot of work to do.”

Things have changed in many ways since Majors and his staff came
to Pitt three years ago. The quality of the players has improved

. greatly. “When I coached the receivers the ﬁrst year, my big
contribution was teaching them how to downﬁeld block for Dorsett,”
cracked Roper. - I

The Fiesta Bowl squad of 1973 was the least talented and most

surprising Pitt team in the Majors era. “I still hold a place in my heart
, for them,” said Roper. “We didn’t think we would have a winning
,,.5. A season, let alone go to a bowl game.” '

There is perhaps only one player on the 1973 squad Pitt has not been
able to replace. The staff is still looking for a blocking fullback to
replace Dave Janasek. .

“It's easier to find a center than a blocking fullback,” said Roper,
who has a quick line for everything,” and there aren’t any centers. It’s
easier to find a bionic man.”

Notwithstanding Lee Majors’ friendship with Johnny, Pitt is still
looking to improve itself in many positions. They should be in the Top
Ten all season. National championships usually go to teams that have
been in contentionlyear after year so a title this season is not likely.

For Bob Roper and the rest ofthe coaching staff, the endless hours of
work will be the same as in the past. Only_ the rewards will be different.

PITT PATTER: Punter Larry Swider is hobbling around on crutches.
He cut his foot on some glass, and a cast was put" on it for

 protection....Pro scouts have shown an interest in Cozens," Perko,
VI? Moorehead, and Karl Farmer....Center John Pelusi, defensive tackle
Jim Morsillo, and linebacker Al Chesley will miss spring drills due to
off-season operations. '

u1j'|iieV)jSIj Expected Us To WinTwo

 

BY TOM HALL
Sports Editor

The Panther basketball season
was but a few weeks gone when I
wandered through the Field House
one afternoon. Tim Grgurich sat
rapping with a couple students,
watching a pick-up game, and
making plans for the Roundball

“ Classic.

Grgurich was smiling, joking
with the kids that passed by,
tossing quips at some of his
players. This was quite unlike a
man who, in his ﬁrst year as Pitt
head coach, had suffered through
one of the most frustrating seasons
in Panther basketball history. I

Perhaps he is considering
writing a book on-“How To Make
the Most of a 12-15 Season,” or
just grateful that, in the shaky
world of coaching, he as not been
"subjected to the degradation
handed Duquesne’s John Cinicola.

Then again, perhaps he is
genuinely pleased with the past
season. If so, you might wonder
why.

“We had a lot of hardships to
face up to at the beginning of the
year,” said Grgurich, still grin-
ing. ’ “After our initial losses (Mel
Bennett and Kelvin Smith) we lost
Keith Starr for the year with a knee

1 injury. -

' “At that point, a lot of people
thought we’d be lucky to win two
games all year, and we went a
respectable 12-15, with four
straight wins at the end of the year.

I’d have to say, with the talent we
had, we had a pretty ﬁne year.”

Through the 1975-76 season, the
Panthers played a total of nine
tournament teams, including Notre
Dame, Cincinnati, Alabama, Mar-
quette, and the surprisingly tough
Virginia Cavaliers, who won the
Atlantic Coast Conference, consi-
dered the toughest conference in
the country by most experts.

“I like the caliber of teams we
played last year,” Grgurich said.
“This is what ‘we want in
Pittsburgh. We don’t have the

‘facilities, the arenas that Notre

Dame, West Virginia, or most of
the ACC schools have, but our
schedule brings in a lot of
recruits.” '

It’s hard to keep Grgurich from
looking ahead to next year, but he
complied by taking another look at
his ﬁrst, tough year.

“I learned a lot this year,” he
says. “I learned that you have a lot
of people to work with, and if you
treat them right, then they’ll do the
same for you. I’ve had to learn how
to deal with the media, the fans,
and my players, and I’m really
learning, and ‘looking forward to
next year.” - I ' ’

It would be difﬁcult to ascertain a
specific point in the season when
Grgurich knew he'd be in _for a long
year. But Grgurich has his mind
made up about that. .

“We were struggling along, and
then made some changes on
offense, and things started to click.
-We won a couple of games, and
then West Virginia came to the
Field House. Tommy Richards
hurt his ankle, and wasn’t quite the
same after that.
McClelland hurt a knee, going into
the toughest part of the schedule,
and, by thetime we got. going
agian, playing up to our potential,
the season was over.”

And now to 1976, and hope for
the future. ’

“Our recruiting is going excep-
tionally well this year, and a lot of
that has to do wih our players.
They are our best recruiters
because they believe in our

program, and can ex—plain..to these
prospects what Pitt is all about. .;
To make that point, Richards has ,
been talking to Joe ' Fryz, who 
attends Richards’ alma mater,‘ 
Moon High School; Wayne A
Williams and Roundball ~pic_k't.."
Nathan ~“Sonny” Lewis played 
together on last year’s Schenley 
state championship team. Wil-. _.._7-i"f‘
liams also spends his summers ‘ 1 
playinglbasketball with tBaldwin’s  
6-11 Ed Scheuermann, whom V 
Grgurich can only call “dynamite.”
“Larry Harris,” continued _
Grgurich, “has made a name for V 
himself here, and now he can 
back to Ohio and sell Pitt to_ some, " S‘ S
out-of-state roundballers.” Iwou_l_d, . 
imagine that would include 0hio’s _ ' A '
all-state star Mike Miday.
Have you wondered why some-
one from far “off Frederick," v. 
Maryland might suddenly develop "1" 
an interest in Pitt-‘? “I found out 7-
that Mel Bennett gave Mike‘_Rice a 
call one night, and talked to him for" t
a couple of hours,” said Grgurich. ‘ t 
“These guys believe in our if 7’
program and the kids in high school up
now are more willing to trust- 
someone who's been here. .  
“Billy Knight has helped out by
calling recruits for us. If tour
recruiting goes theway wehope it -
will, then we’re going to have some .
fun next year.” ‘.
Maybe a Top‘Twenty prospect in‘;
the making?] ' « j
“Let me put it this way,” said 1
Grgurich. “We all love the -game, -
and when we go out and press, and”,
run for forty minutes, we’-re going
to be exciting.”' ' ‘

Defensively, the Pirates. are also
weak in left ﬁeld, where Richie Zisk

I PHILADELPHIA

Where the Pirates have a
defensive problem‘, the Phillies do
not. Not only do‘ they have
defense, but they have hitting to
almost match that of the divison
champions. The only thing the
Phils don’t have.is pitching. '\ ‘

Dave) Cash and Larry Bowa

provide the finest. double-play
_ combination in the division, rivaled

in the league only by the Reds,
Dave Concepcion and Joe Morgan.
Cash and Bowa also provide a good

leadoff combination, each of them _

hitting over .300 last season.

Greg Luzinski and Mike Schmidt-

are expected to keep hammering
home runs along with Dick Allen, if
he shows up for the beginning of
season, that is. -

Garry Maddox plays centerﬁeld
as well as anyone, but the Phillies‘
must make up for with two
tremendous weaknesses. _

One of those weaknesses is at the

. catching position where Bob Boone

and Johnny Oates are mediocre at
best. . or .

The other glaring weakness on
the Phillies team is the lack of a
good starting rotation. Jim Kaat
and Ron Reed should give the Phils
some good games, but Steve
Carlton and Jim Longborg are both
over the hill, leaving youngsters
Tom -Underwood and Larry Chris-
tenson to take up the slack.

Tug McGraw and Tom Hilgen-
dorf are adequate in relief, but the
bullpen is in desperate need of a
good right-handed reliever.

"The Cards possess the best

' Seven months from now, when we’re in the middle of the college
football season, the pro football season is just getting under way and
the hockey and basketball seasonsare just around the corner, one other
sport will quickly fade into ob1ivion—baseball.

Unless we are lucky enough to see another World Series like last
year’s super battle between the Cincinnati Reds and the Boston Red
Sox (perhaps the best Series ever played), baseball will become lost in

' the shuftleof Tony Dorsett touchdown scampers and Jean'Pronovost

hat tricks.

What once was considered the national pastime is hurting not only at '

Baseball Throwing

f

the box ofﬁces, but also in the hearts of, all the freckle-facedﬁév

ten-year"-olds who collect baseball cards and trade doubles to get their
heroes and players on their favorite teams. I used to worship Mickey
Mantle. I had an autographed picture of him on my wall and used a,
model of his glove in~my Little League days. Then Jim Bouton, in his
controversial book Ball Four, labled Mantle a peeping tom and left me

wondering how I could have looked up to that guy. _.By then, though, at -

age ﬁfteen, I was old enough to absorb the shock. '

' I was the first kid in my neighborhood‘ to shun baseball. I began to

love hockey (Phil Esposito was and still is my hero) and my friends
At one time we were" all
baseball fanatics, but no more. ‘
The point‘ is—people are rapidly becoming
baseball. _ . I
Springtraining-camps opened yesterday after a 17-day delay and
more bickering than that done by two old ladies with a hot gossip item.
With basketball and hockey action getting hot and heavy and playoff
time approaching many people don’t even care about the baseball

dissatisﬁed with '

chicken ﬁght_and won’t until the NBA championship and Stanley  A

champion are decided somtime before the Fourth of July.

Who cares if~there’s a baseball season? Thelsmall period between
the end of the hockey playoffs and the startof football season ban be
filled with tennis, ‘golf, autoracing or one of a number of summertime
viewing activities. Baseball players, and most other pro athletes

~ included, are becoming ‘(if they aren’t already) spoiled by visions of

dollar signs circling the bases in-their heads. 0 , V ,
Pro athletes’ don’t know how good they have it. In this area, for’

example, thousands of men spend forty hours a week in dusty, drafty -

steel mills making only $10,000 to $15,000 per year and busting their
you-know-whats for twenty years or more in order to reach the

_ $20,000-plus plateau. The latter figure is common for a ballplayel-"5
.. boAnus—what.he might makefor a week in the World Series.

Phil Musick, sports editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said

yesterday that‘Jim McDaniels, one of the greatest outside shouters in 3"”

pro basketball, jumped his contract with the'Kentucky Colonels of the
ABA and ﬂed to the Seattle Supersonics of,the NBA because Kentucky
failed to have a tilting steering wheel installed. in a Toronado

We’ve become accustomed to such happenings in basketball and

‘hockey, but, with the threatening collapse» of the ‘ABA and the

Quasi-professional World Hockey Association, these twosports have
temporarily forsaken the courts for the hardwood and ice, at least until
the next round of legal action begins. - I .
Now it -is baseball’s turn to make a fool of itself. C_,an football’s
demise be far behind? Let the players keep arguing about playing out
their options, let them rant about how they are treated as slaves
because they must collect their $100,000 from a'~team not.necessaril'y of

their choice. If it keeps up, fans will elect to ‘shun the ballparks and*§"‘»:.

a little fishing in their spare time. In short, they too will be playing ou

Two Gymnasts Return From   NSC

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

Pitt’s men’s gymnastics team,
which failed to win a match during
the season, did manage one
impressive feat—it sent two
athletes, team captain Don Steven-
son and freshman Mitch Spero, to
the Eastern Regionals of the NCAA

Championships. —

Each event was performed twice
for compulsory and optional scores.
The compulsory category is the
more rigid of the two——everything
is done to certain speciﬁcations

In fact, the Pitt team didn't even
work on the compulsory routines
until the end of the season, which
left little time to prepare for the
championship meet. Arriving at
Penn State for the Easterns,
Stevenson found he’d practiced the
wrong procedure for vaulting..

“We’d been working the vault
from the far end—the stoop vault,”
Stevenson said. Adapting to the
new routine, he received two 7.6
(out of 10.0) ratings for the

‘ compulsory score.

Stevenson competed in two other

events, side‘ horse and ﬂoor
exercises, and received his best
showing in the former. He placed
17th in‘ a ﬁeld of 37 with
compulsory scores of 7.8 and 7.3,
optional scores of 8.4 and 8.1. '

Spero didn't fare so well, scoring
4.8 and 4.5 compulsory and 6.0 and
5.5 in optionals.

“He broke severely on both,”
Assistant Coach Elliot Sanft said.
“It was just a lack of awareness
and experience, but_you’ve got to
start somewhere. He was up
against high-quality competition.”

.“Last year it was a different?-
league," Stevenson agreed. ‘fit
was much harder this year. Ifeel I
did a lot better since it was tougher
competition.” H ‘ 

Sanft was critical of Stevenson's 
performance, however, stating’ that '
Stevenson was aware of the 
compulsory requirements for the
vault well in advance of the 

, regionals. H

“It’s a rough competition with‘,,..ff
