Schenley Garage Would Fee Bargaining Breaks Down

Increase Rates 50-I00 %

BY RALPH HAURWITZ

A parking rate of 30-40 cents per
hour would be necessary for an
underground parking garage in
Schenley Plaza to break even,
according to /Joseph Wozniak,
Executive Director of the Pitts-
burgh Parking‘ ‘Authority, in a
progress report presented to
Oakland Development Inc. (ODI)
Monday. ‘

The increase would be 50% to
100% over the present 20 cents per
hour charge for meter parking.

Problems with-the entering and
exiting of cars have forced the
project back to the drawing boards
of Ramp Consulting Services. Inc.,
the consulting engineers.

“They’ll come back with detailed
schemes and statistics for garages
containing about 300, 600, and 900
spaces." said Wozniak. “We will
review them with the Department
of City “Planning and then ODI
before printing up a ﬁnal report on
the economic feasibility of an
underground garage." '

According togRobert Paternoster,
Director of City Planning, the
Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) is requiring Pittsburgh to
extend the reverse bus lane on the
south side of 5th Avenue from Craft
to Bellefield, removing up to 350
on-street parking spaces.

“Off-street parking must be
provided to replace these spaces,"
Paternoster said.

Existing parking in the central
area of Schenley Plaza is 223
spaces. Thus, a 600-space garage
would create 377 new spaces; a
900-space garage, about 677
spaces.

Off-street parking must also be
provided in the Oakland business
area,” Paternoster added.

Pitt owes the City 600 parking
spaces, said Paternoster, since the
University has built buildings
which do not have ample parking,
according to City ordinances.

“Pitt will guarantee 600 spaces
in an underground garage,”
Paternoster explained. “Thus,
although they will not pay for the
garage, if there are losses, Pitt
picks it up.

“In a O00-space garage, Pitt
would pay 100% of any loss. In a
900 space garage, 2/3 of a loss.

“But our" ﬁgures are for 18
months in the future, and take
inflation into account, so we don't
anticipate any loss."

University architect Theodore
Bowman said, "I predict this will
be a substantial burden to Pitt, but
I’m in favor of it. It’s the first plan
for a garage that seems ﬁnancially

feasible." -

Abandon Time Schedule 

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

Vice-chancellor, of Operations
Joseph A. Dutton refused yester-
day to offer his alternatives to the
time schedule charge because the
Pitt News ‘was present at a meeting
in his office with Student Govern-
ment representatives.

When asked by Board member
Bruce Keeler why he would not
discuss the matter with the Pitt
News present, Dutton said, “I’told
you I wasn’t going to negotiate in
the presence of the press.”

Dutton told the representatives,
including President Mike Furick,
he could not openly discuss
alternatives to the time schedule

Pa. Irons Out Death Penalty Bill

BY LARRY PLATT

Intentional killings will be
punishable by death in the electric

The compromise allows for the

age to the San Francisco-Oakland

In the early and mid-l960’s Seale

the agreement juries can weigh
such things as the age or lack of
maturity of the defendant, the
victim’s consent such as in a
suicide. pact or a mercy killing, and
if the defendant committed the act
under forced physical duress.

The jury could change the

sentence from death to life in '

Newton. and the two worked
together in 1966 to organize the
Black Panther . Party for Self
Defense, as it was known then, and
developed various community ser-
vice programs within the party.
These included free breakfasts for
school children, free medical
research health clinics, legal aid
service. and a transport-escort
service for senior citizens.

prison if it considers any of these
circumstances strong enough.
The present debate in the
legislature centers not on the
philosophy of the death penalty,
but rather on its application. Both
bodies have passed bills which
established nine categories of
murder which could be punished by
death. including killing a police-
man, foreman or a guard while
performing their duties. The
House of Representatives first
passed a bill. formulated in its Law
and Order Committee. which did

_not allow juries to show mercy to

convicted killers.

The Senate later passed its own
version of the bill. saying “miti-
gating circumstances" should be,
considered.

The Federal Supreme Court
ruled 5-4 last year that the death
penalty was unconstitutional, criti-
cizing its application as arbitrary.

Thus, _any capital punishment bill -

saying it would decrease waste and
defray printing costs. “We print
29,000 time schedules," Dutton
said. “So we’re «talking about
$10,000." ~

Acknowledging student waste‘ of
time schedules, Furick replied, “I
question that $10,000 coming out of
students‘ pockets will affect a
multi-million dollar university."

Furick proposed an‘ alternative
way to decrease waste by punching
each student’s validation card upon
obtaining a time schedule. He also
suggested putting 1,000 time
schedules on reserve in the

might be rejected and he did not

want them to appear in print.
Also‘in reference to prior Pitt

News stories on the issue, Dutton ‘
said the newspaper has “distorted A
the issue and put us (Dutton and 2

student leaders) in an_ adversary
position.”
Keeler had insisted the Pitt

News remain at the meeting in

order to report the negotiations
because “the issueis affecting all
the students at this school.”

The meeting concluded “without
any productive" bargaining. ‘
‘Dutton and Furick have scheduled

“There are other ways to get .

out of the student’s pockets.” But; ~
he would not relay the alternatives‘ ~

to the Board members.

Responding to Dutton, Furick I

said, “If we could get a budget, we
would tell you where to cut."

Schweiker Announces  

(Continued from Page 2)

—» spending.

In the same year. Schweiker
introduced a proposed constitu-
tional amendment lowering the
minimum voting age to 18.

During the years. Schweiker
became somewhat of an adversary
to the Nixon administration. at
least in legislation matters.

Headlines in early 1970 editions
of the Pittsburgh Press read: “Cut
Waste, Schweiker Tells Military,”
“Schweiker Blasts Cambodia
Move,” and “Schweiker Backs
Students on Cambodia.”

Last summer during the Water-
gate Hearings, Washington colum-
nist Jack Anderson revealed
Schweiker had been named to the
“White House enemies list."

After the disclosure. Schweiker
told newsman he was on the list
because he had been a man of
independent judgement.

In June Schweiker said, “I think
the real tragedy of Watergate is
that we had White House staffers

who spent more time putting
together hate lists and figuring how
they were going to come up with
petty reprisal schemes as opposed
to addressing themselves to the
real problems like high food prices,
inﬂation, health education, and
energy.”

Regarding Schweiker's Senate
voting record, in 1973 he was the
only Republican Senator to vote in
favor of labor's AFL-CIO on every
one of 11 key votes.

According to a study by Ralph
Nader. Schweiker has voted
against the Nixon administration
“in nearly every highly publicized
Senate vote, from the Haynesworth
and Carswell nominations. to the
supersonic transport and anti-
ballistic missiles systems."

In the Senate. Schweiker serves
on the Appropriations Committee.
Labor and Public Welfare Com-
mittee. Select Committee on
Nutrition and Human Needs, Joint
Economic Committee. Technology
Assessment Board and the Health
Subcommittee.

Recent actions by Vice-chancellor of Operations Joseph Dutton
"'tl1reaten to impede our efforts to do our job responsibly. At
yesterday’s meeting between Dutton and Student Government, the
, Vice-chancellor refused to negotiate on the issue of the 25 cents time
 schedule fee while the Pitt News reporter was in the room.

., Inaddition, the Vice-chancellor has shown a regretable disregard for
 responsibility to inform students of those issues and policy
determinations which directly effect them and their pocketbooks.
tudents have a right to know what the considerations were which lead
to an administrative decision in their regard, and they have a right to

"I f We realize the students cannot attend meetings of this kind en

 to exclude us from these negotiations seriously impedes our
efforts to inform the student body on matters of student concern. This

{support of the Student Government personnel involved.

" Dutton’s actions show an imwlllingness to present the issues

“the viability of strident input and effectively isolates students from

lettuce,   Grape--and Wine Boycott

Most Pitt students are now
aware of the United Farmworkers’
(UFW) boycott of non-union lettuce
and grapes. Perhaps not so many
realize that the grape boycott
involves -a more popular product---
wine. The wine boycott is directed
towards three major popular
companies which have refused to
renegotiate contracts with the
UFW: Franzia, Guild, and most
importantly, Gallo. A brief history
of Gallo's dealings with the UFW
will illustrate the issues surround-
ing the farmworkers' struggle as a
whole.

The E & J Gallo winery is the
largest wine makerin the country,
producing one-third of the wine
sold in the United States, and
buying nearly one-third of the
grapes grown in California. [All
California wineries together ac-
count for 70% of the wine sold in
the United States.] according to a
Time article [Nov. 27, 1972], the
company’s before-tax profits for
1971 totaled between 35-40 million
dollars. Gallo is especially

sensitive to the impact of student_

wine consumption since 90% of all
“pop” wine sales in the country in
1971 were among its four major
labels: Boone's Farm, Tyrolia,
Spanada, and Ripple.

In April. 1967, the United
Farmworkers signed their first
contract with the Gallo winery.
Besides a wage increase, the
contract provided for the prohibi-
tion of child labor, the supervision
the
guarantee of decent working
conditions (including such basic
needs as bathroom facilities and
drinking water in the ﬁelds), and
the establishment of a union hiring
hall.

The contract was renewed in
1970, and came up for renegotia-
tion again in 1973. Negotiations
began in March, 1973 with
company assurances that the UFW
was recognized as the sole
bargaining agent for its agricul-
tural workers. However, the

company refused to verbally extend I

the contract beyond the expiration
date, and while negotiations were
going on, began using insecticides
in violation of the contract,
necessitating the hospitalization of
at least one worker.

Despite the company’s claims“
that it was bargaining in good faith,
Teamster organizers were al-lowed
in the fields. Several workers were
ﬁred for protesting the presence of
Teamster organizers while UFW
staff members were prohibited
from entering the fields toytalk to
their members about the negotia-
tions. In May, Cesar Chavez, the
UFW head, called for elections to
settle the dispute regarding repre-
sentation. The company refused,
claiming that the UFW was still
recognized as the onlyubargaining
agent.

However, negotiations were cut
off by the company in June, and
Gallo told its workers that the
teamsters Union had been given

notice that they represented the‘

"workers and that the company was
ready to negotiate with the
Teamsters. By July, all the regular
Gallo workers were out on strike
and scabs were brought in to
replace them.

The Gallo winery and the
Teamsters signed a contract on
July 9', 1973, which eliminated
several major provisions of the
United Farmworkers’ contracts.
Although the wage levels provided
by the Teamster contract are lower
than those negotiated with other
wine producers, the major differ-
ences involve job security and
working conditions. The Teamster
contract gives the company com-
plete discretion in hiring. This
means that the union hiring hall
and the seniority system, the only
assurances, of job security, were
effectively abolished. The com-
pany is thus permitted to reinstate
a labor contracting system under
which workers are recruited by
independent contractors who are
free from supervision or control.

Crisis Gives New SC

BY TOM SMITH
During his campaign Mike
Furick was described as unﬁt to
assume the ofﬁce of Student
Government (SG) president be-
cause of his past record of inactivity
as an SG Board member.

Furick has been president for
only a week. Yet, already be has

asserted himself and established a‘

set of priorities for the coming
year. The events of the past week
should silence his critics.

At the SG Inauguration cere-
monies, Furick quoted Pope John
XXIII. “We must open the
windows and let in some fresh air
and let in some new ideas." Furick
has been faithful to his promise.

Within an hour of the swearing--
in ceremonies the newly elected
president became aware of the
proposed time schedule fee (25
cents). By late afternoon a memo
was drafted and sent to all student
organizations asking for their
assistance.

Though Furick was committed to
improving the relationship between
Student Government and the
student groups. the initial step was
made much sooner than originally

planned Circumstances prev nted have to work through ‘and, with the

 

any delay.

And the University admini-
stration deserves much of the
credit for speeding up this long and
difficult process. Without the
proposed fee the Government and
the organizations might still be
searching for an initial contact.

Whether the University succeeds
or not in its attempt to charge for
time schedules, at least the fee has
served as the catalyst in closing the

communication gap between SG

and student groups.

For the ﬁrst time in recent
memory, student groups were
collectively invited to a special SG
meeting. Organizational repre-
sentatives were provided’ an
opportunity to affect governmental
policy. The session gave the
government a chance to inform the
groups of the problem and solicite
their opinions for future action.

In his speech Furick also
expressed his hope for “working
together" with the administration.
The SG president has realized the
need for good relations with the
University.

This need was echoed by
Furick s predecessor, Rege Kauf-
man. when the latter-said, ‘_‘You

isnssé

Not only is job security threat-
ened, but, since wages are paid
through the contractor, he can take
money out of the wages for
transportation costs, etc. Further-
more, the Teamster contract does
not provide for the strict regulation
of health and safety standards or
for the effective enforcement of
those that do appear, particularly
those applying to the use of
pesticides.

The circumstances surrounding
the Gallo contracts are not unique.
Nearly all grape producers in
California refused to renew their
contracts with the UFW and have
signed with the Teamsters al-
though no elections were held to
determine if the workers wanted
this change in bargaining agents.
The issues o.f job security, wages,
and working conditions are gener-
ally the same for all disputes
between the UFW and the growers,
whether grape or lettuce.

Through the use of the boycott,
the’ UFW is asking consumers to
exercise their right of free choice,
and to choose products not only on
the basis of price but also on the
policy of a company towards its
workers. In particular, the UF W is

asking people to ‘express their-

disapproval of Gallo’s labor prac-
tices by refusing to buy Gallo wines
until decent contracts are signed
with what is still’ the elected
representative of the Gallo work-
ers, the United Farmworkers.
Among the Gallo products which
are being boycotted are Boone’s
Farm, Thunderbird, Spanada, Ty-
rolia, Ripple, and Andre wines as
well as all labels marked Modesto,
California. Those wineries which
have signed contracts with the

UF W and can serve as alternatives A

are Italian Swiss Colony (Annie
Green Springs, Bali Hai, Zapple,
Sangrole, Italian Swiss Colony),'

Almaden, Paul Masson, and
Christian Brothers.

administration. Anynegativism on
that is going to close a" lot of
doors..."

It is unfortunate the good
relations between students and the
administration have been threat-
ened because of a quarter fee. This
incident, though, may set the tone
for the future.

_ At that time SG can work with
the University in a cooperative
effort for improvement in areas of
student concern. Both groups can
work together for the students, and
not against the students.

Furick has proven himself
capable of handling the SG
presidency. He assumed a difﬁcult
job under very difficult circum-
stances without an opportunity for
adjustment.

However, the ﬁnal judgement on
Furick will not be made for another
year. In the meantime he has the
opportunity to resolve many
student concerns. particularly in
the areas of intramurals and
registration.

SG does not exist to respond only
to crises. Much work needs to be
done and many goals await
achievement._ But, students are

Robert Casciato, an Oakland
resident and ODT member, was
critical of the underground garage
plan throughout the meeting.

“It may be a white elephant,” he
said, “since it won’t be used
enough during the summer.

“It seems to be foregone
conclusion that this garage is going
in--come hell or high water. I feel
like the City is a Steamroller and

I'm under it," Casciato com-
plained.
Paternoster, however, insisted

the garage is still in the study
phase:

“If the study proves it’s not
feasible, it's not going to be done.
And unless the whole package is
tied together with a park on top, we
won't dig the hole.

“The land in Schenley Plaza is
City parkland, and is now actually
being used in violation,” Pater-
noster continued.

“I think a park there could be
very nice. However, the money for
it has yet to be resolved, since it is
not included in the garage cost. It
would probably cost about $1
million and be financed by public
and private funds.”

Dave Houston, Chairman for the
Transportation Steering Committee
of ODI, expressed dissatisfaction.

“What’s brought to us is a
mechanical cost anaylsis--it is those

~ other costs that the community is

concerned with," Houston said.
“What’s going to happen to streets
like Atwood, Bouquet, Oakland,
Louisa, Bates, and Pier when such
a structure is built?

“If you can’t demonstrate this
structure will do something posi-
tive for this area, the committee
(ODI) has no reason to support it.”

Death Penalty

The Conference Committee
agreement is expected to be
released for full legislative review
this week and is not expected to
meet serious opposition.

Governor Milton Shapp has been
on record as being opposed to the
death penalty. But a spokesman
from his press office said: “There
have been bills in the past that
although the Governor did not
personally like them, were in the
best interests of the state.

“The, Governor would have to
see the temper of the people and
then wait to see the specifics of any
bill before making a decision.”

Zord said the sudden upsurge in
support of capital punishment
came after the murder of a warden
in a Philadelphia prison and a
guard at Western Pennitentiary in
Pittsburgh.

Russian Author-Poet Arrested

(Continued from Page 1)

“Solzhenitsyn is calling for a
moral renaissance, a religious
revival,” said Koehler, “not a
revolution. He is one of the
greatest living authors."

Koehler said she noticed a
change in the atmosphere in Russia
since an earlier visit in the 60s.
“Everyone is afraid,” she said, ‘‘I
was advised not try and see
Solzhenitsyn.”

Koehler mentioned that people
introduced to her in the Russian
literary underground are under
constant pressure, and a few have
since been arrested and sent away.

“One young man had been
serving a three year sentence in
Siberia for his writings,” she said.
“His sentence is up and they

refuse to let him return.”
Koehler insisted the Soviet way
oflife is not the Russian way of life,
and that away from the control of
the government in cities there is

greater freedom. “The Soviet
culture is the sub-culture in
Russia.” she said.

The Russian Embassy in

Washington declined to comment
on the arrest of Solzhenitsyn,
although in an earlier interview an
Embassy press agent commented
Solzhenitsyn was a “soap-bubble”
who had received unwarranted
attention in Western press.

The State Department in
Washington declined immediate
comment on the Solzhenitsyn
arrest, although its representative
admitted there could be a

precedent for action in the matter.

Senator Hughes Scott’s press
secretary, Bob Heatherington, said
it was too early to comment on the
arrest of Solzhenitsyn and that any
sort of action on the author’s behalf
would be complicated by a tradition
of non-interference with the
internal issues of foreign nations.

“Very frankly,” Heatherington
said, “We have to realize that he is
a Russian citizen.”

The University of Pittsburgh has
reportedly received several phone
calls requesting some form of
statement on the arrest of author
Solzhenitsyn. However, Chan-
cellor Posvar, Executive Assistant
to the Chancellor Charles R. Coble,
and Provost Rhoten A. Smith all
were unavailable for comment.

“Solzhenitsyn belongs to every-
one,” said a student of the College
of Arts and Sciences, “not just one
country.”

BY ED HOLLIN
Correspondents Sander Vanocur,
formerly of Public Broadcast
System and NBC, and James
Naughton of the New York Times
Washington Bureau, agreed news-
men's shield laws may be more
dangerous than a recent Supreme
Court decision limiting a reporter's
right to withhold information about
conﬁdential sources.
That decision was the Earl
‘Caldwell case, in which a Times
reporter was cited for refusing to
reveal a confidential source to a
grand jury. The ruling was upheld
by the Supreme-Court in 1972.
Speaking Monday night before
approximately 250 persons at
Lawrence Hall, Vanocur mentioned
the problem of determining who a
shield law would cover.

Eggs:

BY MONICA A. CIROCCO '

“The simpler~-the better" was
the moral learned by 100 freshmen
who participated in the “Egg
Delivery Competition" held Feb-
ruary 11-12 as part of Engineering
3, a creative design course.

Divided into 30 teams, the
students had. to construct a vehicle
capable of deliveriiig an egg,
intact. 16 feet over or around a
six-inch barrier located midway
between the starting point and a
bull’s-eye target. The vehicles
were judged on originality and
accuracy, with 110 points the
highest score possible. This
included a 10-point bonus if the egg
was actually placed on the
bull’s-eye.

Dr. Alan Brainard, director of
the freshmen engineering pro-
gram, said, “We discussed the
project in class. I told them that
the simpler the vehicle was the
better because the more com-
plex--the_ more that could go wrong
with it.”

Despite ‘ the warning, many.
students constructed elaborate ve-;

hicles which stopped short of the
bull’s-eye or never even reached
the target. One student confronted
with a few" jeers, said, “It's
working--that’s all that counts."
There were a few successes. The
top scorer on the first day of
competition was Leonard Kovalsky,
receiving 100 points with one of the
smallest entries. His battery-oper-

 
      

s

ated cart made a semi-circle around
the barrier. It contained a spool of
thread which unwound until the
vehicle reached the bull’s-eye.

“I spent a day making the cart
and six hours figuring out how
much thread to put on the spool.
The hardest part was ﬁguring out
at what angle to place the wheels,”
he said.

On Monday, two teams received
100 points each: Karen Krejdov-
sky, Lee Wilson and Sonya Hanczar
constructed one of the simplest
entries. Two parallel and notched
wheels rolled over the barrier and
onto the target, dropping the‘ egg
on the bull’s-eye.

The electric-powered cart of Gene
Mannella, Fred Summers, Myles
Kapusta, Brad Martin and Ron
Pappaport propelled a long wooden
extension, containing the egg, over
the barrier and on to the bull’s-eye.

Brainard concluded, “I was very
pleased with the competition.

The 1954-55 appearance of the
first white Rock and Roll was a wild
T ,. -fusion of gutsy black blues and
ﬁr’ white country twang called Rocka-
 billy.) This basic combination is to
this day the essential ingredient of
 Rock and-Roll stew. Although most
ﬁfties Rock and Roll of any
.¢ significance was produced by
' ‘blacks, the white Rockabilly per-

,sonalities~were responsible for a
’ unique sound that bubbled with
fresh creative energy. Rock
journalist Jon Landau says of
Rockabilly’s initial impact, ‘‘It
1 was, at its best, unpretentious,
tell you to get up and dance."

V Blll Haley was actually the first

popular music. He had a string of

hits and then faded aginst the
dynamic performers who leaped on
stage in 1956.

Rockabilly was the creation of
one man--Sam Phillips--and his
Memphis-based Sun records. Sun
began as a tiny blues label in 1953,
with a roster that included.Little Jr.
Parker, James Cotton, Rufus
Thomas. But with the release of
Sun #209, things changed. That
record was “That’s Alright
Mama," a vintage blues by Arthur
“Big Boy" Crudup, performed by
19 year-old Elvis Aaron Presley.
Presley borrowed freely from the
bluesy beat of Little Jr. Parker and
Kokomo Arnold. He cut a path for
white rock and roll with his ﬁve Sun
recordings--all excellent examples
of early rockabilly. Today, the
original discs command over $100
each from collectors. Sun then sold
Elvis’ contractto R.C.A., and his
chain of rock‘ and roll classics
(“Don't be Cruel,” “Hound Dog,”
“Heartbreak Hotel") carried him
through the ﬁfties.

Carl Perkins was signed by Sun _

in an attempt to duplicate Presley’s
success. He never achieved the
popularity that his great Rockabilly
deserved. However, his place in
Rock and Roll history speaks for
itself in his most famous com-
position, the Rock and Roll staple
“Blue Suede_ Shoes." The Beatles
admitted Perkins’ inﬂuence by
recording three of his songs

major Sun artist, and gave Rock
and Roll a jolt with his frantic

But in .1964 the British onslaught
occurred. Almost simultaneously
the musical ideas of Berry Gordy,-
Jr. jelled, and the stylized Detroit
R&B rolled off the assembly lines
of Tamla-Motown.

Blues is by origin a part of
American culture, but ironically the
initial impact that won blues its
most extensive recognition in its
own country came from another.
Reeling with the inﬂuence of blues
tours that visited England in the
late ﬁfties, a ﬂeet of British bands
followed the Beatles into America.
These whites with black roots
paved the way for blues/R&B
exposure to a mass American
audience. Said John Lennon: “In

famous of these being the group
that appeared on the bootleg
“basement tapes”. Dylan’s liner
notes and some other miscel-
laneous poetry plus some pleasant
but insignificant drawings to
accompany some of the songs. The
main question to be faced is how do
the lyrics to Dylan’s gvreat records
stand up on the printed page?
The answer is that the results
vary. The best of Dylan's early
so-called protest songs such as
"Blowin' in the Wind" seem to
hold up reasonably well. Some
may seem dated now and indi-
vidual lines stand out as never
having been any good but in
general they are still moving.

Dylan: Book, ALbum, Concert

Dylan's finest songs. from High-
way 61 Revisited (1965) and Blonde
on Blonde (1966) perhaps suffer the
absence of music more than the
early songs as they were more
dependant on the accompa-
niment that is on these albums.
The best of these songs. such as
“Like a Rolling Stone" and
“Positively 4th Street" are still
great as the violent hatred that
propels these songs still makes
them extremely powerful.

Earlier rock songs from 1965's
“Bringing it All Back Home"
generally hold up well. especially
the marvelous “Subterranean
Homesick Blues." In general then
regarding the rock songs. the ones
which were dependant on great
lyrics like “Subterranean Home-
sick Blues" look fine in print while
songs like “Rainy Day Women #12

& 35" seem better on the records.

The “basement tapes” songs,
the best known of which are “I
Shall be Released” and “Quinn the
Eskimo” are interesting, while the
lyric to the songs on“John Wesley
Harding” impress me as being
among Dylan’s best. The songs
on this fine record which was less
dependant than its predecessors on
musical accompaniment, show
Dylan at his best. Nearly the _whole
range of Dylan’s lyric-writing skills
from humor to clever use of cliches
to subtle and interesting ways of
delivering a message are repre-
sented.

Lyrics to the later songs such as
those on Nashville Skyline are
unimpressive as a whole but the
songs were not intended to be
profound. just good music. Thus
they suffer without the music.

The book can best be regarded as
a supplement to Dylan's record
because the songs in print can't
have the force given to them by
Dylan's fine, expressive singing
and generally good backup mu-
sicians.

Dylan as a performer. As shown in
his tour, where he was backed up
by one of America's finest groups,
The Band, Dylan is still a great
performer. In the concert that I
saw, in Philadelphia on the
afternoon of January 6, Dylan
proved he can still make his old
material sound fresh and relevant.

Playing songs from nearly all of
his albums, he performed “All
Along the Watchtower",“Like a
Rolling Stone", “Lay Lady Lay"
and about a dozen others. Playing
with the band on most numbers, he
did four songs accompanied only by
his acoustic guitar. The highlight
ofthe acoustic part of the show was
“It's Alright Ma,
Bleeding)". The Band performed
about a dozen songs from their first
3 albums.

The release of Planet Waves on
which Dylan is also accompanied
by The Band coincided with the
tour. Planet Waves which leans
more to rock music than most
recent Dylan records is pleasant
but not a great record. Most songs
have pleasant, trivial lyrics but if
Dylan does not want to write songs
with lyrics like his earlier ones, his
audience must respect that de-
cision.

Highlights of the album‘ are
“Dirge” a song reminiscent of

(Dylan songs like “Positively 4th

Street” but more mature in

approach as Dylan blames himself ’

as well as whoever he is attacking.
Other songs in the album, with the
great “Wedding Song” the most
explicit, indicate that Dylan doesn’t
want to be a leader. They also
indicate that he has found peace of
mind as he alludes to times of
personal troubles as being in the
past. The album, like the concert
shows Dylan’s desire to be just
another musician, not a leader.

All three, the book, the album,
and the concert serve to remind
people of Dylan's great accomp-
lishments. Dylan wrote perhaps
the most sophisticated lyrics to
ever grace a rock song. On paper
they do not have the significance
that Dylan can lend them in concert
and on records with his perfor-
mance.

the press. Up until the summer of
1971, “the attacks were a pain, but
manageable,” said Vanocur.

He denounced the effort that
summer to stop publication of the
Pentagon Papers, the first attempt
of any administration at prior
restraint, according to Vanocur.

Naughton directed most of his
criticism at the news media itself,
while concurring with Vanocur’s
worry over the first amendment
climate. “Spiro Agnew had a lot of
things right about the news‘
media,’,’ Naughton said.

He mentioned a “Seven Dwarfs”

profit ahead of professionalism”
and Sneezy, “the newsman who is
allergic to one side of the story.”

Both men credited a few
individuals at the Washington
Post, not the press in general, for
bringing Watergate to the surface.

Naughton praised the televising
of the Ervin committee hearings,
but criticized the secrecy of the
Judicial Committee investigating
impeachment.

“The public has a right to
watch,” he said, “and the ability to
be discerning about it.”

Vanocur, now a consultant for
the -Center for the ‘Study of
Democratic Institutions, criticized
his former employer, public tele-
vision, as “amateurish” during a
question-answer session following
the journalists’ prepared remarks.

“I’m not an unqualified admirer
of p_ublic broadcasting,” he said.

teaches “Black Women," will lead
tonight's 7:30 seminar.

Turner has compiled'an exten-
sive . bibliography which is an
analysis of research done on black
family. His article, “Some
Theoretical and Conceptual Con-
siderations for Black Family
Studies”, was in the Black Lines
journal in 1972. Turner is on the

cussion leader, is a professor of

federal and corporate programs for
minority business development.
Assisting Doctors will be William
Tito, director of the Student

on minority business development.
“I’ll be talking about what the
federal government isn't doing
with minority economics." Doctors

said. “I've already taken them -to

Not concerned about being
overconﬁdent for the Cleveland
_State game tomorrow night at the
Field Housc'(8 pm), Pitt basketball
coach Buzz Ridl is talking about
‘/and looking forward to a post-
season tournament.

“I don't worry about overconﬁ-
dence with this team," he said at
this week's basketball luncheon.
“These guys just love to play."

Cleveland State rates among the
weaker schools on Pitt's schedule
this year. The 5-16 Vikings have
lost three starters. including the
top two scorers and leading

A crowd of 3,000 is expected for
the game, and student exchange
tickets are not needed. Exchange
tickets will be required for the
other two home games left on the
schedule, against Temple (Feb. 20)
and West Virginia (Mar. 2).

The guest of honor at the
luncheon was Pitt's All-American
candidate, Billy Knight. Knight
received accolades from the various
area coaches in attendance, then
the talk shifted to the playoff
situation.

Knight made it clear he wanted
to play in the NCAA playoffs. “I

It's another beautiful day in Hawaii. The second and last day of the

professional tomato throwing championship.
‘ $110,000. Twentieth prize (last place) earns $100,000.

There are two teams in the PTTL (Professional Tomato Throwing
League). In the west division is the Coors Creamers. The east division

consists of the Tuborg Purees.

First prize is worth

The names of the competitors are much more familiar than the
names of the teams. Assembled on the beach of Waikiki are 20 of the j
 . 22 first-string All-American football players.

C they all attend either Olympia State College or Rheingold University.

These two schools are the top gridiron powers in the country. Right
after they played in bowl games, these twenty football playersjﬂew to
Hawaii to compete In the only PTTL meet of the season.

The thought of a college football player getting a hundred thousand
_ dollars to throw tomatoes in Hawaii shouldn't be that farfetched from
anyone’s mind. It's quite legal under the NCAA pro-amateur rules.

Not so coincidentaly,

The rule states that a college athlete may compete in one sport as a

professional and one as an amateur.

The intention of the

rules-committee was to make it possible for people like Pitt's Ernie
Webster, who signed a pro football contract, to compete in another
sport while in school. Webster is currently putting the shot for the Pitt

track team.

I have nothing against Ernie Webster being on the Pitt track team.

I’m all for it.

What the new. rule has done though, is made it

rediculously simple to get around the old recruit-spending rule and the

brand-new ‘.50 scholarship limit.

The ﬁcticious characters in the PTTL are merely wealthy alumni who
sign athletes headed toward their alma maters to RI IL contracts.
They could fly them out to Hawaii several times to show them where

they'll be throwing the tomatoes.

It would be no bother at all to raise the prize money at the PTTL
championship a few thousand dollars. thus allowing the gridders to pay_
their way through college and not count as one of the 30 scholarships.

While things may not reach this extreme, minor violations will

flourish. A few thousand dollars to play in a semi-pro basketball
league will easily save a school a scholarship.

Pitt head football coach Johnny Majors had little comment on my

scheme when I presented it too him several weeks ago.

“I haven't

studied the rule carefully yet." he said.

Majors had expressed dismay at the 30 scholarship rule when it was
initiated last year. He had hoped it would be altered at the NCAA
meetings in San Francisco last month, but all that came out of the
meetings were the amateur-pro rule and a new blocking-regulation on

kicks.

In typical fashion, the bumbling NCAA failed to remove ‘a existing
obscure rule which makes signing a contract difficult for most
collegians. The rule states that an athlete may not have an agent.
UCLA running back James McAllister signed a contract with the World
Football League, then was told he could not compete in track because

he used an agent.

The new blocking rule says that a player cannot block below the
waist away from the line of scrimmage on kickoffs and punts. it is

intended to cut down on injuries.

Majors didn't like the change.

“It will take a lot away from the excitement of the kicking game," he

predicted.

It also will change the type of player used to block on

The NCAA continues to flounder in incompetance. The scholarship

limit. has been cut to an unrealistic number (100 over a four-year
period). Any two-sport athletric- (as most high school grid stars are) will
have no trouble becoming pros in their freshman year.

If the PTTL needs sometargets for its tournament. there are plenty
of stuffed-shirt NCAA executives who would be quite suitable.

prestige and the better teams,"
said “Mooney".

“This team wants to play,”
added Ridl. “We dOn’t want to
hide.”

Pitt looms as the top candidate
among the Eastern schools for the
three at-large bids that normally go
to this section of the country.
Syracuse had been a contender, but
their losses here and at West
Virginia practically eliminated the
Orangemen from contention.

Providence and South Carolina

are considered the other teams
most likely to get a bid. Pitt plays
the Gamecocks in Columiba, S.C.
February 27. The bids will come
out soon after that game.

The Panthers’ first game in the
playoffs would be Saturday, March
9. The site and opponent will not
be determined until all the bids
have been issued.

A victory in that game would
send the Cats to the Eastern
Regionals. to be played March 14
and 16 in Raleigh, N.C. The
winner of the Atlantic Coast
Conference Tournament (North
Carolina St., North Carolina,
Maryland, etc.) will probably be
favored there.

The survivor in Raleigh goes on
to Greensboro, N.C. for the March
22 and 24 ﬁnals.

Pitt will still be assured of a
berth even if it lost one more game,

and probably would get one with"

two more losses. If they don't get
one, the Commissioner’s Touma-
ment and the N.I.T. come into the
picture.

The Commissioners Tourna-
ment. also known as the runner-up
tournament, is in its first year. The
St. Louis affair will feature, as the
name indicates, runner-ups from
most of the conferences _in the

also be given.-

,Ridl is glad to discuss the
tournament situation. He doesn't
have to worry about overconiidence
or looking ahead, because as he
puts it. “Some of the weaker teams
on the schedule have given us our
toughest games. Everybody wants
to be the one to break our string."'

Tip-Ins: Pitt's average scoring

ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR
After battling league leading
Carnegie-Mellon to a four all tie in
its last WPIHA outing. the Pitt
Hockey Club will resume the fight
to keep pace with the Tartans
tonight against Indiana at the
Belmont Arena in Kittanning, Pa.

Pitt remains in second place.

might be against the other clubs,
but still providing points to keep
the Tartans in first place. Pitt can
only match C-MU win for win and
wait until February 23 when the

two teams meet for the last time in
the regular season.

Indiana, on the other hand, is
looking for all possible points to
help insure a playoff berth.
Currently the Indians are holding

down fourth place, just one points

behind an improved Penn State
(MeKeesport) team. Indiana blew
an opportunity to catch PSU when
the Duquesne Dukes fought them
to a four-four tie at the Civic Arena

year, especially those vital “four
point" contests with PSU (Mc-
Keesport) and Duquesne.

The last time Pitt met the
Indians, the skaters left the Civic
Arena ice with a 6-2 victory in a
lackluster affair. But tonight
Indiana will have the home ice
advantage working for them. if that
means anything against a still
powerful Pitt team that has never
lost to the Indians on any rink.

Purdue) warranted his suspension.
Whether or not he resumes his first
line wing position is up to
Barcawlo, since Greg “Mad Dog”
Mintz has been skating well with
Charly Hagins and ‘Denny Browne.

SLAPSHOTS: Pitt’s inability to
subdue Carnegie-Mellon over the
last two seasons has really set some
of the skaters thinking about that
“jinx”....both Greg Mintz and Bob
Arturo had Tartan goalie Jeff Hart

and both fanned on opportunities
that could have iced a Pitt
victory....Hart has modified his
style of netminding somewhat from

goals scored against him in the tie
