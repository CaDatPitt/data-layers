Independent

Toss Reins to Juniors

‘Vlerit, Merit,’ Aldisert

Before Rally of 130 Men, Women Students

Leaders of the Independent Party opened their political cam-
paign ‘Wednesday with the theme “Last year We asked for a break—-
this year we can stand on our record.”

Before a meeting of 130 students in 24 Cathedral, leadership of

Party Heads

Emphasizes in Address

the Independent. Party was passed’

over to the junior members of the
group, David Tucker, C41; Riigy
Aldisert, C41; Bill McElwain, C41,;
and Fred Robie, Ed41.

Emphasized by the speakerswas
the Independent attitude toward fra-
ternities, as expressed by Aldisert in
his opening speech:

“The Independent party has no
quarrel with fraternities as such.
We are not anti-fraternity. We do
believe that fraternity membership
should not be the only reason for
representation in student govern-
ment. Merit and merit alone should
be the basis. We feel that the Inde-
pendent Party must represent the 80
per cent of non-fraternity students
on campus.”

Jack Hoeveler, C40, Independenit
leader during the past year, explain-
ed that the group intends to continue
its policy of merit for campus office-
holders.

“Pat Cusick at the SFA meeting
Tuesday spoke about lack of coop-
eratic=.1 from the members. In my
opinion he was hitting at the mem-
bers of his own group, the fraternity
people. ’

“Cusick has done a swell job with
SFA this year, but he has started
with some little things. Next year it
would be a good idea for the frater-
nities to begin with big things by
putting some good people in.”

Other speakers at the "meeting were
J. Karl Stark, C40, one o-f the found-
ers of the party; Clarence Shepard,
BA40, member of the SFA executive
committee; Dorothy Ann Carrier,
C41; Lewis Riley, C42; Fred R0-bie,
C41; and Adele Yorio, C41.

Wednesday’s meeting marked the
ﬁrst attempt of the Independent
group to begin this year’s program.
The rally was open to all students
for a statement of the party’s pur-

I

pose.

Veinegar to Act
Despite i n jury

Players’ Lead Carries
On Theatrical Tradition

Playing the role in “Counsellor-
at-Law,” Pitt Players’ production
which opened last night at Foster
Memorial, was an actor who “carried
on” in the best traditional fashion
although he did not know at what
time he might be “carried off.”

George Veinegar, E40, read his
lines and followed his stage direc-
tions last night although doctors be-
lieved him to be suffering from a
brain concussion. Veinegar was re-
-cently released from Mercy hospital,
following an automobile accident in
which he received a severe injury
to his head.

While awaiting results of X-rays
to determine his exact condition, he
again appears as the principal figure
in the drama tonight in Foster Me- I
morial beginning at 8:15 o’clock.

Laura Jean Smith, Ed40, plays
opposite him in the feminine lead of
Regina, the secretary. Other mem-I
bers of the cast of thirty include such I
veteran actors as Peggy Nelson, C40, I
Herb Hohstetter, C41, Milton Mosko-
vitz, C42, Virginia Hosp, C42, and
Mabel Anderson, C42.

At First indeperidcrit Party

By Irv Kaufman

Ma-de up of office holders, disap-
pointed o:i"fice seekers, aspiring pol-
iticos, the combined staffs of my
co ‘eagues Aldisert, McElwain, and
Hyde, and of people who, like my-
self thought they would see “The
Crusades,” downwards of 146 per-
sons gathered in 24 Cathedral last.
Wednesday noon to ﬁnd out that al-
though “the Independents aren’t
mad at anybody,” they certainly are
peeved.

Called to order by Bill “ﬁnd me a
pep meeting” McElwain, the meet-
ing was turned over to the charms
of the golden-voiced Rugy “rank’n
ﬁle” Aldisert. Brother Aldisert, re-
cently returned from big—city politics
where he single-handedly secured
the election of Kane and Rankin, act-
ed as chairman or ringmaster (de-
pending upon your party afﬁliation.)
Stark Spouts

Campus luminaries who spoke at
the party meeting were Babe Stark,
historian of the party, Clarence “sky-
rocket on the kick-off” Shepard,
Dave “me ’n Lasky” Tucker, Dot
Carrier, Lew “sure I’m a 3 pointer”
Riley, Adele “those on blue tacks,
turn over” Yorio, Fred “activities
man” Robie, and Jack “The Great I
Am” Hoeveler.

Also present and taking bows
were George “step down” Hyde, and
Joe “glamor boy” Kristufek.

   

 ii otiy

note was struck when Dot Carrier,
head of the grievance committee, I
think, complained that independent
women don’t have a chance on the
Pitt campus. This slam at
twelfth floor is supposed to have hurt
the feelings of Sister Gertrude Broi-
do, AEPhi but another loyal party
worker. Outside of these slight de-
fections, the meeting was quite suc-
cessful . . I imagine.

,Sorry,- No Tea,

The speeches consisted of one lead-
er getting up and saying “we are not
anti-fraternity” and of the next
speaker saying
must go” and of the next speaker
saying “we are not anti-fraternity,”
etc. According to the official count,
the organization is “not anti-frater-
nity,” seven speeches to six, with
Hoeveler casting the decisive speech.

To this unprejudiced reporter, it
seemed that the year’s ﬁrst revival
meeting was not quite in the “true
University spirit” because neither
tea nor cookies were served.

Evidently, the Independent leaders

the I

String Quartet
To Give Recital
For Students

Through an arrangement made by
the University administrators the
Stradivarius String Quartet of New
York will give a free performance
for University students, in Foster
Memorial, next Thursday.

Co-sponsored by the department
of music appreciation and the SFA
concert hour committee, the quartet
“is the most important outside mu-
sical organization to appear at the
University this year,” announces
Dave Mackey, E40, chairman for the

 affair.

Because of a limited seating capac-

’i ity, tickets will be distributed-free
of charge—to all students interested »
" in the- event.
, today at the information room, and

Tickets are available

the hostess’ olﬁce, ﬁrst floor, Cathe-

dral, the dean of men’s and the dean
of women’s offices, and the music de-
partment office, 422 Cathedral; and
in 106 State Hall.

Mackey urges students to secure
tickets immediately, to facilitate invi-
tations to outside organizations—-
possible only after extra seats are
determined.

Hey, Prof!‘

Hoeveler Announces
Circulation Campaign
Today, the Panther roars.
Of course it’s the Pitt Panther, hu-

mor magazine, and it is the vocal
chords of Business Manager J. W ish-

; art Hoeveler, C40, that are making

the noise as he announces plans for a
circulation campaign among the fac-
‘ulty members. ‘ ‘ ' I

t seems that professors will be ap-
proached by the legions of the cir-
culation staff members and will be
offered, “the greatest opportunity in
the world, the chance to obtain the
next seven issues, including the Cap
and Gown issue, for the nominal sum
of $1.”

Main selling point of the drive 
that each issue beginning with the
January issue will contain contribu-
tions by the members of the faculty.
In fact one page will be set aside for
the writings and sketches of the
‘ higher ups.

The English people are very vague as to why

The (lei-n1ans, of course, are 11na11.i111ously in

their propaganda ministers. l\/laybe it is because
the people have Mein Kampf and a song called
Deutschland Uber Alles to lead them.

Phi Beta Kappa

This week many campi will
hold appropriate ceremonies to
honor the oldest and most famous
scholastic honorary, Phi Beta
Kappa. But no celebrations will
be held here.

The U11iversit_v still does 11ot
have a chapter of Phi Beta
Kappa. Vtllien one was request-
ed, it was refused hecaiise the
l1o11orar_v disliked certain prac-
tices here.

Two of these blackmarks have
been erased. Our library facili-
ties are lieiiig improved and our
athletic policy is being cleaned
up.

But the cl1:«1pter is still bei11_ej
held up. Phi Beta Kappa re-
fuses to have a chapter here be-
cause the l.'11iversit_v is still
blacklisted by the An1erica11 As-
sociation of lliiiversity Profess-
ors for failure to provide aca-
demic freedo111 and tenure a11d
because the l'11ive1:'sitv still re-
ceives had 1_')ublicit_v in the news-

You’d be surprised how telephone

engineers put them to work for you

How to put more and more wires into a telephone cable
without increasing its diameter is an ever present problem
at Western Electric——manufacturing unit of the Bell
System. Existing ducts beneath city streets limit both the
number and the diameter of cables-but demand for tele-
phone service continues to grow.

Until recently, the largest cable contained 3636 wires
in a diameter of 2% inches. Years of study led to an en-
tirely new insulating process that saved 3/1000 of an inch
per wire. Multiply this tiny fraction of an inch by 3636,
and you provide enough space to place 606 more wires
in the same size cab1e!—a total of 4242.

With such resourcefulness, Bell System engineers meet
countless problems. Result: you can talk to almost any-
one, anywhere—quickly, at low cost.

Pla;:.:-1 for 3:1 Undergraduate Letter-
men’: club are being hastily drafted
by charter members of the ur.-der-
graduate lettermerfs committee. 
group of varsity athletes  sports
leaders gaveled over by chairman
Joe Kristufel<.

Kristufel: popular campus leader
and captai of the varsity tennis
team. speaks for the undergraduate
lettermen and the members of his
committee when he claims: “This
idea has been a long standing one in
the University and has been sorely
needed. It has worked out success-
fully at the Michigan campus and
other large universities, and there is
evidence that it will. be well received
on the Pitt campus.”

The club, as was mentioned, has
been  success at the University of
ll/Iichigan. It is an association of all
unde1*gra.di.zates who have earned
their letter in a varsity sport, so that
they niay have closer relations
aniong themselves. ‘

It would create a ﬁne tradition, at-
tempt to acquaint athletes with one
another, and would be an aid in
building up the campus spirit which
so recently has been sparked.

The group would hold their own
dances,  monthly, help out let-
terman ﬁnancially, and would create
organization which would appeal to
all lettermen on campus.

Final arrangements for the Letter-
men’s club will be drawn up at a
large meeting with some 70 athletes
present on January 8 in 24 Cathe-
dral.

Members of the committee are:
Frank Kristufek, football; Emil Na-__
rick. football; Allan McKee, track;
Bob Johnson, basketball; Joe Kris-
tufek, tennis; and Dick Cassiano,
football. The committee will be un-
der the advisership of swimming
coach Ben Grady who helped intro-
duce the idea.

Fullerton Returns

To Home in Newark

Pitt footballer Dick “Congo” Ful-
lerton has been permitted to leave
the New York Polytechnic hospital
where he was suffering from a head
injury, and_,return__to_his home in
Newark, New Jersey, to rest, it was
announced today.

The Pitt center was knocked out
in the season’s opener with Wash-
ington and again in the game at
Fordham. So seriously was he in-
jured in the latter contest that he
was forced to remain in New York
for observation. A close examina-
tion disclosed that the star center
was suffering from a brain concus-
sion.

Hospital authorities stated that, al-
though Fullerton was permitted to
leave the hospital, he will be unable
to attend classes until February.

<:out.cst.s are on tap for today, and
six volleyball duels and six table
tennis pairings round out a spark-
ling‘ two day card.

Very different from recent years,
top-flight contests in the independent
bookings, as well fraternity, are the
rule. The Punks head the rankings
in non-amliated league, heretofore
dominated by Newman Club aggre-
gations.

The Punks, who grabbed practi-
cally all the glory in all-intramural
touch football competition, put a
“mystery ﬁve” on the floor tonight
that threatens to steal plenty of
thunder from attractive fraternity‘
encounters.

Punks, Newmans Set

Manager Sam Milanovich, one of
Doc Carlson’s ice cream fed proteges,
reveals a conspiracy afoot among
sundry varsity athletes who are
bound by no fraternity ties to take
the all-intramural all-point trophy
out of circulation within the ranks
of the social organizations, and make
it apermanent track house ornament.

Seeking to add a basketbal.l cham-
pionship to the football honors, this
“mystery five” makes its debut at the
stadium tonight when they do battle
with the College Hicks. Although
manager Milanovich withheld his
roster for publication, the  of
Joe Vaughan, Harold Nehf, George
Cunningﬁham, and Johnny Kapurka,
all passers of reputation, have been
mentioned in connection with this
occult entry.

The other quintets who promise
to give the independent leaguesome
brilliant play are the Newman Club,
current holders of the loving cup, the
Phys Ed Majors, and two high-gear-
ed outﬁts from Paul Zehfuss’ fresh-
man squad, the Blizzards and the
Zephyrs.

, Rivalry Keen

However, the new blood in inde-
pendent leagues has served only to
give the set—up a balance of power,
for there is every evidence of the
keen enthusiasm and rivalry in fra-
ernity circles. All the brotherhoods

have entered teams, and today’s ac- ,
tivity finds 12 of the 13 bowling‘

teams in action.

A great race throughout the sea-
son is predicted in the bowling cir-
cuit where the Theta Chis ruled su-
preme last season. The defending
champs must stand off the challenge
of strong rollers from the Delts, Pi-
KAs, Phi Delts and Phi Gams.

With Ollie Hurst in the alumni
category, the current ping-pong art-
ists from Bayard street pin their
hopes on I-F prexy Jim Kennedy and
Dan Cannon. The Delts had their
baptism of ﬁre yesterday and meet
the Kappa Sigs, who may prove a
stumbling block with Chuck Wuer-
tenberger in top form.

Jaffe Astounds Sporting World

By Picking All»-American Team

By Bert Jaffe

With our
plicit rules,

friend and colleague, William Mazefsky,
we attempt to pick the cream of the 1939 All-Americans.

Some will argue that the most important position on any team is the

backﬁeld.
that the center

every play and therefore he would
position.

After searching through all the
schools that subsidize and then ﬁnal-
ly watching the Pitt team practice,
our center still remained a mystery.

Rules one and two of Sir William’s
list give little aid in ﬁnding our piv-
ot man. Rule three can also be omit-
ted because even if we could spell,
the printer wouldn’t believe the
names.

Rule four brings up the unfavora-
ble subject of cynics, and the sports
editor doesn’t know what that means.
That crash you just heard was rule
four being relegated to the ash can.
Smaltz Is Center

Mr. Mazefsky advocates the elim-
ination of Francis Wallace’s pre-sea-
son stars. The players that Mazef-
sky chose to overlook would make a
good team alone. Our opinion differs
with Bill on rule ﬁve.

Stout hearted men can overlook
rule six as it deals with women. And
we’re women haters.

Rule seven concerns jealousy, but
we haven’t the slightest idea what
position he plays. And we’re not tied
down to one gal as is Willie “the
kid.”

Rule eight . . . censored. It men-
tions the Panther.

We are well acquainted with Frank
Carver so we ﬁnally agree with our
collegue on rule nine.

Quoting rule 10 we ﬁnd, “Why pick
a team? What do we have sports
writers for?” Now we ﬁnd ourselves
out in the open. Are we or are we
not sports writers? Incidentally, you
need not answer that question.

Has anyone found us a center yet?
Well, isn’t she the pretty girl. Is it
true that her boyfriend is the ice-maxi
and his name is Joe Smaltz. Well, to

to pick. Those two huskies that work
for the Brink armored trucks do
enough guarding each day to win po-
sitions on this mythical team.

Our tackles ﬁt into the picture per-
fectly. Mazefsky picked himself a
fine job trying to tackle that story of
his so ‘we place William at one tackle.
Frankie’s bartender seems quite cap-
able of tackling a scotch and soda,
We don’t know his name, but he al-
ways gives McElwain such a nice
smile that we had to put him on the
team.

We honor two great ends o-n this
great team. Andy Ferguson and Bill
McJunkin of the twenty-seventh floor
end their ﬁve-year course come June
16. Where could anyone ﬁnd such
enders?

Publications Backﬁeld

With such a line, it isn’t necessary
to pick a backﬁeld but here goes.

For quarterback Bob Adams directs
the attack. If he’s a good ﬁeld gen-
eral this will never see the light of
day in The Pitt News.

The two Bobs of the journalism de-
partment, Graham and Machesney,
rate the halfback positions. Graham
cand wend his way through more pa-
per getting into his oﬁice than Har-
mon can on an end sweep. Mac is
just as tough knocking down ex-
pense accounts as Mel Hein is on pass
defense.

Jack Hoeveler wins the fullback
position hands down. If anyone can
say that Jack isn’t full of something
or other, then we’ve been under a
misapprehension for four years.

Well, you asked if we wanted to
try it, so it’s your tough luck.

cla
in an appearance.
A hard fought game between the‘
.hem and the Evening
School ﬁves found the former ahead ,
14-6. Hufnagle led the winners in
scoring by tallying four points.

Led by Rosenbloom and lacking
the services of Ruskin, the Pitt Club
completely overwhelmed the Amity
Club by a 38-10 score. The Pitt club
displayed the same scoring punch
that made them runner-up to the
Newman Club last year.

The Blizzards handed the Upper
Dentists a 24-15 defeat Wednesday
night at the Stadium court. The Bliz-
zards, a quintet of freshmen, who
were left holding the bag because of
no freshman -competition, started oﬁ
on the right foot in notching their
initial triumph. Neely was the in-
dividual star of the evening, ac-
counting personally for 15 points. ,

The Newman Club, last year ﬁnal- I
ists for the basketball championship, ,
accepted a forfeit donated by thel
Pharmicists. A double forfeit was
imposed on the YMCA and Chem
Frosh teams when both failed to
make an appearance. Thus both are
officially charged with a loss and
neither with a win.

YMCA Dinner Meeting

Lecturer Will Discuss ‘Must We Go to War?’
Before University’s Weekly Forum Monday

Kirby Page, noted author, lecturer, and authoi-iij,« -.211 ;?n‘.e:';':ational af-
fairs, vcill speak twice on the University campus 1'15’.-X1‘ l\’l<m.rlay.

. - _ ‘
Mr. Page, whose revealing volume on the causes and r.~u1’es. of war en- 5

titled “Must We Go To War?” received world-\vide l“f:“(:O;.'j,*ll'i‘l(.‘.Yl, will take

the same subject for his Inquiry
Forum talk at 12:30 o’clock Monday
in 132 Cathedral. He will later dis-
cuss “Youth in 'l‘oday’s World of
Conﬁict” at a dinner discussion in
the Y clubrooms at 5:45 o’clock.

Known throughout America for
his strong non-intervention argu-
ment, Mr. Page is the most outstand-
ing speaker to appear on the Uni-
versity campus this year, according
to Harold Viehman, assistant secre-
tary of the University YMCA.

In his Inquiry Forum address Mr.
Page will answer vita]. questions re-
lating to the war and American for-
eign policy: If Hitler‘ wins the war,
will the United States then be in
danger of invasion? Is the spread
of Hitlerism so ominous a threat to
liberty that it must be destroyed
through victory in war? Should the
United States help the other democ-
racies to destroy the totalitarian dic-
tatorships‘? Does not frightfulness,
in the form of unrestricted subma-
rine warfare an.d air raids over ene-
my cities, prove that war must be
waged until Hitlerism is extermin-
ated? How could Hitlerism have
been prevented, and how can its
threat to democracy now be re-
moved?

A graduate of Drake university,
Mr. Page is a member of Phi Beta
Kappa and a contributing editor of
the Christian Century. He is the
author of a number of books includ-
ing “Living Courageously,” “Religi-
ous Resources,” and “Living Crea-
tiVely.”

Tests tfontinue

Students Make Better
Than Standard Scores
The question of whether men are
mains unsettled if the testing ma-
chines which have been in 124 Ca-
thedral this week are proof; for, an-
nounces Dave Buente, C41, chairman
of the safety campaign committee,
not enough women have taken the
tests.
“You don’t have to be able to drive
to take a test on these machines,”
states Buente. “Anyone can take it.”

In spite of the fact that so few
women have entered into the com-
petition fo-r the $5 prize for the high-
est score, Buente is well satisﬁed
with the large turnout. Approxi-
mately 500 students have already
taken the tests.

The average scoreemade by the
students at the University surpasses
that set by the Studebaker‘ company,
owner of the machines. The average
for the glarometer, a machine which
tests the driver’s ability at night, was
set by the company as four, and that
of the students, so far is two. On
this machine, the lower the score
the better the driver, according to
traﬁic scientists.

On the steerometer, which tests
daytime driving accuracy, the safe
score was 75, while that of the stu-
dents is 78. In this case the higher
score shows greater ability.

Other members of the safety cam-
paign committee are: Frank Miller,
C41; T. A. Beatty, C43; Harris Hawk-

ins, BA4l; Robert Jones, BA41;
James Kennedy, C40; and T. J.
Lewis, C41.

‘Newsboys’ Sell
Papers Monday
To Aid Charity

Attempting to better the record set
by University students in previous
“old newsboy day” drives, leaders in
activities and prominent persons on
campus will d.on the costumes of
news vendors for a day in order to
raise funds for the C.nildren’s hos-

{WSGA and leader of the campaign
:on campus.

Special issues of the Pittsburgh
Press will be sold at the Univer-
sity from 10 to 1:30 o’clock on Mon-

One hundred dollars has been set
as the goal for the University in this
year’s drive, a drive that is being
conducted in all the leading colleges
and business schools of Pittsburgh.
Proﬁts from the University sale last
year, which totaled $77, exceeded
the amount raised in the other
schools, and were the most donated
by the University in the past five
years, according to Miss Pyle.

Christmas Fund

A gift from Dr. John G. Bowman,
chancellor, has been added to the

“This is a ﬁne, worthwhile proj-
ect,” the chancellor stated in mak-
ing his contribution, “and I wish it
great success this year."

contributions to be turned in at the
office of the dean of men, 809 Ca-
thedral. All money will be used to
purchase canned food, and this food
will be added to the quantities do-
nated by members of the fraternities
and other organizations on campus.

“This drive is not for fraternity
men alone, but for all students at the
University. We are earnest in our
request that as many students as pos-
sible bring some contribution of
canned food on Friday, December 15,
and place it with the other contri-
butions in the alcove at the south
end of the Commons Room,” Eger
states.

Needy families in the Pittsburgh
district will be given food gifts for
Christmas through several charita-
ble organizations.

by the use of the special 10-cent
transfer which the Pittsburgh Rail-
ways company adopted last Tuesday,
it was estimated this week.

Formerly University commuters
living in the outlying districts in
the South Hills, North Side, North
Boroughs, and Homestead were
forced to pay two tokens each way,
although some were able to take ad-
vantage of the old--fare-zone trans-
fer which costs 15 cents, a saving of
one and two—thirds cents per ‘trip.

With the new transfer one may
travel from the Cathedral to the
downtown area and transfer to any
car going into another one-fare zone,
or to the farthest point on the Wil-
kinsburg line. The transfer is sub-
ject to the same regulations as the
regular transfer with the exception
that it is good for two hours instead
of for one hour and a half.

Circulars giving complete informa-
tion regarding the fare reduction will
be available in the Cathedral. today,
according to J. A. Lloyd, public re-
lations manager of the Pittsburgh
Railways company.

In recent laboratory tests, CAMELS burned 25%
slower than the average of the 15 other of the largest-

selling brands tested — slower than any of them.
That means, on the average, a smoking plus equal to

EXT TIME you light a Camel,
notice how slowly it burns.
How smoothly and evenly.

A scientist would tell you that
this s—l-o-w “rate of burn” ‘means
cooler, milder smoking—-with all
the natural fragrance and ﬂavor
in full, rich measure.

Fast-burning cigarettes pro-
duce a hot ﬂat taste and a dismal
lack of fragrance. Came1’s slow
burning is your guide to certain,
steady smoking pleasure.

Camels burned 25 % slower than
the average of the 15 other of
the 1argest—selling brands tested!
