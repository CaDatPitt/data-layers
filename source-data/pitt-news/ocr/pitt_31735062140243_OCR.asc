In a poorly played game last Fri-

team defeated the Juniata ﬁve ‘by a
score of 42 to 29. The visitors played
more aggressive ball than the Blue
and Gold during the early part of the

game, and it looked for a time as

if they were going to have little trou-

Word and ‘Song by Students
and Speakers. »

Vi/ashington's birthday was ﬁtting-

;:_ly celebrated last Friday morning

with exercises in the assembly r_oom
of Thaw Hall. The speakers of the
morning were Dr. E. H. V\/ard, of,
Saint Peter's church, Forbes street,
and Dr. G. A. M. Dyess, of the Uni-‘
versity faculty. The Chapel cihoir,
under the direction of Prof. Ferdi-
nand Berger, rendered a pleasing pro-
gram ofvpatriotic. and classical songs.

The theme of the ﬁrst speaker’s ad-
dress, Dr. Ward, was “International
Peace,” and in a straightforward and

convincing manner the possibilities of

national and international rest were
pr-opounded. The leading thought
brought out was, the fact that world-
wide peace is not a thing of the pres-
ent, but a feature of the future, which
is fast working toward ultimate reali-
zation. The students were implored
to aid the cause of peace by learning
the lesson of justice and brotherhood
in dealing with their fellowmen. As
a ﬁtting conclusion: to the remarks,
Dr. Ward quoted the.lines of. Kip-
ling’s Recessional. ‘
The topic assigned Dr. Dyess was,
“George Washi.ngton,”,and it is pos-
sibly not exaggerating the fact, when

year on the 17th of March,
makeup of the team is not fully de-
ci(le(l upon, l)ut the ﬁnal ‘selection is
to be made in a few (lays. The sub-
ject for debate this year is the much
discussed income tax, which will no
doubt ‘bring out many interesting
phases of the question.

The schedule.arranged by the three
members of the association, is as fol-
lows: Allegheny College at Pitts-
burgh, Pittsburgh at VV00ster Uni-
versity.

Under the careful coaching of Pro-
-fessor Fish the University representa-
tives ought to make a very creditable
showing, both at home and abroad.
‘The candidates for the teams have
given the income question a great
deal of faithful study a.nd their efforts
should be rewarded by victory.

I . In another column of this issue will

‘ eral/ tenor of~the‘ letter is, the avoid-
ance by the parents and friends of the

“_a Yeqlleset on the part‘of the Univer-
sity administrative authorities to call
J-the attention of the.~.parents, that the
‘time of 'the.Universitye men and W0-
 jtnen i.n the evening does not ‘belong
to any other place, than the prepara-
; K tion of the morrow’s lessons. The
 jgeneral intent of the letter is on the
‘  ,_lwho’le,' good, that is, it would be most
‘h.igh1y‘eﬁ‘1cient if it were conﬁned
strictly to the members of the Fresh-
Lrhen or Sophomore classes, but the
.1 fact that it is intended for men, who
have reached the position of Upper-
fclasrsmen is almost ludicrous. The
Vaverage, Senior or Junior is well aware 5

where there is supposed to ‘be suffi-
-cient maturity to regulate the hours’
of pleasure and duty. It is notﬂthe

totherwise belittle the efforts of the

TEAM GOES To PENN.

The athletic committee of the Uni-lg

versity last week reconsidered their?
action of a former ‘meeting and de-3
cided to send a relay team to the an—‘,
nual games at Philadelphia in the:
spring. The committee is entitled to;
the thanks of the students in the in—i
stitution, for the determination to;
have the University of Pittsburghi
represented in the biggest athleticl
carnival of the college year. The?
classiﬁcation, which last year placed;
the ’Varsity runners completely out’
of their class, has been removed‘ by
the Pe_nn authorities and the teams of-
this section,.VV. & J., Tech and _others
are all on an equal footing._ The
beneﬁt which "the University will re-
ceive from the mere appearance of
the name in the entry lists is sufficient
cause t-o justify. the dispatch of a
team. The Weeklyis aware of the
ﬁnancial condition of the athletic
association, and that strict economy
must be practiced in all branches of
sport. It is fully understood that it
requires a considerable outlay’ of
money to send .a team to the Phila-
delphia games, but surely the incen-
tive .it~_gives the candidates for the
track work is quite adequate to cover
the deficit arising from monetary em-_.
barrassment. The men, who nightly:
go out tolpractice must have some in»
ducement, other than the "glory of
self—satisfaction, and one of the prin-§,
cipal means to attract men to work;
energetically’ and faithfully is thei
prospect of a trip. The uninitiatedi
may look with doubtin.g countenancei
on that statement, 'but nevertheless it;
is a fact, ‘borne out in all athletic con—l
tests.

The athletic committee has!
shown itself to be a farsighted and:
able body in" its decision to send a re-:
lay team to the Quaker City. .

with great possibilities for the-future'

  Our Letter Box  

To the Editor of the Pitt \/Veekly:
1t has come to my notice that a
letter, purporting to be from

of the University, was

avoidance of me during six evenings?
of the week. VVhen I entered this in-‘

stitution I thought the fancies of

childhood had long past, but the re-,
ceipt of that kindergarten letter_has
determination a»

given my mannish
rude blow.’ lt seems highly pertinent
to me, that a man or woman capable
of entering a University is likewise
able to regulate the time for play and
work. If the. University of Pitts-
burgh wants to improve the scholastic
standing of its students, why doe_sn’t

it adopt the methods of other largel

institutions, when the men fall behind
in their work—as the saying is,
“throw them out.” I believe, Mr.
Editor, that is the remedy needed; of
course it is severe _medicine,'but it is
an adult’s dose, and rL'otVa child’s sip
in the fonm of a whining letter". ~

Kindly give this slight suggestion
for. the improvement of study a place
in your most valued columns. I am,
sir, V

ing mailed to the parents of all stu-
dents Who reside in t-he city. No
comment is necessary: G

Dear Sir:——-Students who live at
home are often interrupted in their

study’ hours by members of the fam-i

ily who do not realize how important
it is that the study time shall ‘be ab-
solutely devoted _to -the University
work. Lon-g accustomed to call upon
them to discharge certiain duties or to

joyments, it is not easy always to re-
member. that all the time at home,
during the six days, should‘ be given
to study and reading and other duties
assigned by instructors. ~

This letter is sent out to the par-
ents of allrstudenits residing at home
with the earnest request that every
member of the family seek to guard
sacredly t-he time of the student so
that he may do ‘his best work. We

are sure that we ca11 count conﬁdent-

ly upon the co-operation of parents
to this end. ,
Ieam very sincerely yours,
