Many Europeans consider 1983 to
be a crucial year because of the sche-
duled deployment of cruise missiles
in Western Europe, and according
to members of a British women’s
peace group, women have a part to
play in taking responsibility for the
future into their own hands.

Toni, a member of the Greenham
Common peace camp, discussed the
past strategies and activities of the
all-woman camp in an ihformal talk
sponsored by the Pitt Arms Race
Study Group and the Pittsburgh
Peace Network. Toni said she pre-
ferred not to use her last name for
both personal and political reasons.

The peace camp is located near an
American Air Force base in Green-
ham Common, Great Britain, and
has .been' in existence since Sep-
tember l98l. The location was
chosen because it was the destina-
tion of a women’s 125-mile march
for life and the camp was set up
spontaneously. /

Since its beginning, there have
been many actions‘of civil disobe-
dience at the camp and Within the
confines of the high security military
base; British women take a differ-
ent approach to protesting which
uses outrageousness and imagina-
tion, Toni explained, because it
"defuses hostility" on the part of the
police.

Summer is the timeiior music and this musici
playing a tune near the Carnegie Library.

“The symbolism and colors are
very important,” she said. “We use
them to catch peoples’ attentions
and their imagination.”

Not all demonstrations of civil
disobedience have been humorous,
but Toni recalled examples of a few
that were.

During a massive demonstration
near the base last Easter, a few of the
women decided to go into the base
and have a Teddy bears'picnic, Toni
explained. She described the women
who were sewing furiously in order
to have the colored fur costumes
done in time. *

“Thirty or 40 women in bear cos-
tumes climbed over the fence.” Toni
said, “and when the police arrived,
they were really baffled. Then, they
sort of chucked us out of there.”

Commenting about the press cov-
erage of the occasion, Toni said the
language differs from paper to
paper. Oneconservative newspaper,
she said, reported that the women
had been dressed as Russian bears.

A similar demonstration took
place when the women found out
that the minister of defense was due
to visit the base.

Three women dressed in snake
costumes. and entered the base to
talk with the children in school and
with construction workers to ask
them how they felt about their work
and the weapons, Toni said.

“Things the women do are spon-
taneous and never planned,” Toni
explained, “like climbing over the
fence and inside the base—it sort of
got popular and women started
doing it all the time."

Because there is no set strategy,
Toni could only hint at what could
happen in Britain during the

summer.

There is an old legend, she
explained, which says the land near
the missile silos is where dragons
once roamed. “We might call up the
dragon to encircle the base,” she
said.

Despite her light-hearted talk,
Toni spoke seriously about the
camp. the cruise missiles and the
June 9 elections in. Britain.

There have been three evictions at
the ’ camp, according to Toni.
Women have been scooped up with
bulldozers and dumped,into ditches,
she said. These incidents received lit-
tle attention from the press, but one
barricade did. “It was broken up so

violently,” she explained, “that the -

newspapers the next day had head-
lines about the police’s breaching the
peace.“

In another incident, she said,
police smashed windows and the
dragged the woman across the
broken glass. On December 12,
30,000 women gathered for a dem"-
onstration and blockade of the base.

University Silences i

Student Network

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

Pitt’s Office of Student Activities
has suspended the recognition and
programming privileges of a student
organization because of the group’s
disruption of the May 19 Board of
Trustees meeting. _

The Progresssive Student Net-
work (PSN) will also have its univer-
sity allocations account frozen until
Andy Smith, the director of student
activities, can meet with the entire
group and discuss the conduct ofthe
club’s officers at the board meeting.

According to PSN business man-
ager Dana Reed, two members of
the group met with the Student and
Academic Affairs Committees at
9:30 a.m. that same morning and
were told that the proposed tuition
hike would not be on the board’s
agenda. Reed said the group was
also told that observers were not
allowed to participate in the meet-
ing. Yet, club president Tom Wanko
interrupted the meeting for what
Reed said was three minut_es ‘and
voiced opposition to the proposed
tuition hike. Reed, Wanko and an
unidentified student were then asked
to leave, which they did. The three
were the only group members in
attendance.

On May 26, Smith sent a letter to
Reed informing him of the suspen-

cial Patrol Group (SPG) was called
in to disperse the women. Many of
the women, she said, suffered dislo-
cations and other injuries after
members of the SPG picked them up
by their thumbs and carried them
away. ’
Toni said she is also concerned
about new developments in Britain

sions and the frozen allocations. The
allocations were frozen, Reed said,
because of an advertisement that
appeared in The Pitt News the day
before the meeting. The ad informed
the public of the meeting and said
“Stop theTuition Hikes! No Cuts in
Student Aid and Services...Be there,
or pay the 10% Hikell”

Reed said the organization used
the ad as a recruitment ad, a type of
ad that university funds allocate,
because it was recruiting people to
go to the meeting. —

Smith said’the ad was not a

recruitment ad because it was not ‘

recruiting members, only urging
people to attend the meeting.

“It's difficult for someone to con-
vince me that that ad was in the spirit

A of what a recruitment ad should be,”

he said.

Reed said the actions that student
activities took against the group
were “purely political" and that the
university doesn‘t have any grounds
on which to suspend the
organization.

Smith said he was well within his
authority to suspend the organiza-
tion because the disruption of the
meeting went against university
procedures. Procedures, he said, o£
which Wanko and Reed were aware.

He said the two were informed of the‘ ’

Soldiers at the base are allowed to
use their judgement, and women on
the base can be shot on sight, Toni
said.

The exact number of women liv-
ing at the camp varies and can reach
100.000 or more, accordin to Toni.

The rate of women entering
major colleges and universities
across the nation will be levelling
off in the next few years, accord-
ing to Cynthia Vanda, assistant
to the provost's office on
women’s issues.

Vanda’s position is relatively
new to the university. She has
worked for the provost‘s office
since November I982 and prim-
arily deals with administrative
policies that will improve condi-
tions for women at Pitt. Pres-
ently, 48 percent of the students
attending Pitt are women, and
that’s very encouraging, Vanda
said.

The former director. of the

The 80’s Student

vveyed from the class of 1981 had

women’s center said that women
have reached a peak in college
enrollment. She believes the
increase of women in major col-
leges will not continue for long,
but there will be an increase of
women majoring in the physical
sciences, engineering and law.
A study conducted by seven
colleges, including Harvard,
Barnard and Vassar, found that
male and female college students
are beginning to share the same
goals for careers and family.
Researchers said a decade ago,
most female students would
aspire to careers that were tradi-
tional for women. Only 3 percent
of 8,000 female students sur-

similar aspirations. Male stu-

Pitt’s work study program has
received funding for next year at
a time when many other universi-
ties are suffering cutbacks in
funding.

An increase in federal money
will enable Pitt’s work-study
program to continue, The
government has approved $50
million in a special jobs bill for
college work.

The work-study program
employs between 900 and 1,200
students, and according to Dan
May from the office of admis-
sions and student aid, employs
30 percent of the student
population.

The work-study program has
had problems recently with stu-
dents who cannot receive finan-
cial aid, he said. Students who
have recently had reduced
income due to family layoffs or
similar problems have over-
whelmed the program. Part-time
‘jobs, he added, supplied by the
university and local employers
can become vitally important to
a student who has trouble mak-
ing ends meet because of his own
or_ family lay offs.

“We try to place everyone we
can,” May explained, “but our
problem is, we try to place skilled
kids in appropriate positions.”
He added that the students the
office is unable to place are
referred to a job placement
service.

May said this program con-
sists of approximately I,l00 stu-
dents, and almost everyone who
has some kind of skill is placed in
a job. .

The most encouraging aspect
of the new federal funds, accord-
ing to May, is that the existing
federal regulations will be effec-
tive for the next 4 or 5 years,
which means the program is not
in immediate danger.

The program is alive and well
and will continue to help stu-
dents make it through college,
May said. The increase in funds
for this program is good news to
the many Pitt students who are
counting on their jobs.

British Wage Peace Campaign

4 continued from page one
“There is a hard core group of
approximately 35 women who live
at the camp all the time,” she
explained. Men were a part of the
group at one time, but they found
that the men wanted to be too pro-
tective when the police were around.
They also found that the police
would treat the men roughly and
pursue them first. Men now play a
part in the camp as support and help -
take care of the children women
bring to the camp with them.

Toni said she does not want to

3}? think beyond December (the date of

in

scheduled deployment‘) and admit-
ted to being scared, but she said that
she “tries not to think about it."

“She [Margaret Thatcher]
announced a huge advertisement
campaign [to promote cruise mis-
siles],” Tom said, “but because of
public outcry against spending
money [on the campaign] she was
forced to abandon it."Toni thinks it
is likely Thatcher will win the
upcoming election, largely due to
the fervor over the Falkland Islands
incident.

Toni added, however, that British
polls show that 67 percent of the

people are against the stationing of

_ cruise missiles, considered to be a

first-strike weapon.
“We can't physically stop the mis-

, siles," Toni said, “but we can edu-

cate the people and challenge their
attitudes.”

The camp maintains contacts with
many similar_ groups throughout
Europe and the Eastern Block coun-
tries. Another such peace camp is
scheduled to begin in Senaca falls,
NY, on July 4. ,

The lecture was filmed for cable
television and will be televised on
communi_ty access channel. ‘

('m1Iin1u*(I from /)ug'(' I/u’rI_\' our
dents are now assigning higher
priority to child rearing and fam-
ily life. Thirty-three percent of
the men surveyed stated they
would prefer to stay home or
work part—time while their child-
ren were preschoolers.

The I983 census bureau report
differs from Vanda‘s statement.
The report claims that women
are still entering college at an
increasing rate and this number
is now surpassing that of male
undergraduates.

Even with the increasing
numbers of women and blacks in
college, some feel that Pitt’s
administration has maintained a
conservative attitude towards
non-traditional students. The
university recently stopped fund-
ing its Women’s Center after 10
years.

The decision to close the cen-

proper way of protesting the cuts at
the morning meeting.

Smith said the suspension of the
group was not a normal proceeding
because there was never a group that
had disrupted a Board of Trustees
meeting since he has been at Pitt. He
did say, however, that this was not
the first group to be suspended as a
disciplinary measure.

The group has a history of not
going along with university proce-
dures, Smith said.

“We have a kind ofiagreement
with organizations that they are
going to abide by university regula-
tions or they won't be an organiza-
tion." he said.

Although Smith denied that his
actions resulted from any pressure
from the Board of Trustees or higher
offices in the university, Reed said
that he did.

“The actions were clearly aimed at
the politics of the PSN.” he said. “It
was definitely motivated from
above.” '

Smith said no further disciplinary
actions will be taken by his office
against the group or its members.
Reed said that he could not be disci-
plined because he has good aca-
demic standing. He did say,

however, that the group could be

listed as a subversive one.

Although President Reagan has not yet
declared his candidacy, he is currently laying the
groundwork for a re-election campaign in 1984.
Among the issues the president may inject into
next year's race is his support for improving the
quality of education.

Reagan's concern for the minds of America's
youth does not, however extend to the millions of
underprivileged children living and studying in
our inner cities.

Improving the quality of education costs
money, both in terms of higher teacher salaries
(which Reagan supports) and the costs of upgrad-
ing educational facilities and materials. So school
districts that have money—or that can get it-—can
afford to improve the quality of their programs.
Districts with less money available, including,
most notably, inner city schools, may not be able
to afford improvements.

This is, in theory, where the federal govern-
ment steps in to supplement the funds available to
school districts in economically troubled areas.
The task of reducing inequalities in school fund-
ing must fall to the federal government because
individual school districts and states cannot
affect‘the budgets of schools outside of their
limited jurisdictions.

Further, reduction of these funding inequali-
ties is an important step in opening new horizons
for the urban poor and interrupting the cycle of
poor parents, bad schools, poor children that can
trap poor families into poverty for generations.

One of Reagan’s pet projects—-—known as “New
Federalism"—is not consistent with these goals.
New Federalism aims to reduce the role of the
Federal government as “the big equalizer” in
many areas, including education. In addition,
some city school officials claim that the new Rea-
gan “block grants” to the states for education are
being channelled to suburban and rural schools
rather than to inner city districts where the need
for funds may be considerably greater.

Do not be fooled, then, by Reagan's bright
banners proclaiming better schools and brighter
youngsters, for the fine print means less and less
for America's poor. I

Eckankar

Dear Editor:

I am writing about the let_ter of
May llth, “Eckankar Religion
Explained.“ The most striking
inconsistency straight off was the
title you tacked on. The letter
explained nothing except that Eck-
ankar is not a religion. On rereading
the letter several times, I found
nothing explaining what he actually

‘ DID believe.

The author certainly was justified
in protesting Eckankar‘s being listed
as a cult, on the same level as the
Moonies. However, Eckankar is still
a religion in that it deﬁnes man's
existence and future in the cosmos

Still Unexplained

and follows daily exercises (I won't
call them rituals) intended to spiritu-
ally elevate the believer.

Eckankar cleverly avoids the
problem of religious inquiry by say-
ing, “It's not a religion, and all those
religions are true and they're all the
same." This benign shoulder-patting
has been seen before in Theosophy,
The I Am, Baha'i and myriad pop-
psychology books. How, may I ask,
is one to choose which truth to fol-
low?

If, as the author says, “nobody has
a monopoly on the truth," then
Christ, Krishna and Guru Ma are all
our One True Leader. Each had a
message incompatible with the
other-—can truth be self contradic-

tory? Sorry, Name Withheld Upon
Request, I don't buy it. Even if you
can't find a logical basis for believing
something, you haven't proven that
everything is true.

It is very trendy these days, espe-
cially with the resurgence of interest
in Gandhi, to say “I am a (Christian-
/Jew/ Hindu/Eckist) but other reli-
gions are all OK too". This sort of
attitude negates any argument a per-
son can give defending his belief.

No, Eckankar is not a cult. It'sjust
another name for the pantheistic
chaotic mish-mash that most people
call “their religion".

cares about his audience.

It takes courage to stop being
David Brenner, _“Entertainer", to
become David Brenner, “Person."
Apparently Ms. Lefkowitz does not
appreciate people with personality
or courage. The point of the appear-
ance was not to be an entertainer,
but a person. It seemed most people
in the audience appreciated this.
Unlike the article which stated that
“Much of the audience...left," I
noticed only four. ls four out of 400
really “leaving them napping.?"

Apparently she was the one nap-
ping, for like the editor who
spawned her, she misquoted
Brenner. She ended the article with
Brenner's saying he turned Broad-
way down because the “lines are bor-
ing." What he said was that the

repetiveness of the same show would
be boring. A convenient misquote
for a disappointed writer, struggling
to make the real events match her

own tear blurred views.

Objectivity and integrity have
been banished from the news room.
In the future, The Pitt News should
allow their intellect to guide the
story, not their subjective views. I
fear, though, if The Pitt News staff
followed its intellect, it would lead
them ‘to realize where they belong,
back in a remedialjournalism class.

Dear Editor:

I. too. attended‘ David
Brenner's presentation on Satur-
day. May 2|. Unlike your repor-
ter, however, I came with no
expectations, and thus I was

' neither “sadly disappointed" nor
did I find either Brenner or the
event “boring." On the contrary.
I found Brenner's question-and-
answer session refreshing. sin-
cere. interestingand educational.
I hope that mine is not a minority
viewpoint among those in
attendance. ,

Still Refreshing

P.S. Brenner's critique of tele-
vision as being primarily a vehi-
cle for mass marketing was made
in response to my queries about
NBC’s cancellation of SCTV.
His description of SCTV as ‘
being truly innovative, as a
reaching out beyond the boun-
daries of what has already been
done. was, in my opinion, “right

in."

WHAMMY!
The B-52's
Warner Bros.

After their brief but pleasant
vacation in Mesopotamia last year,
The B-52's are back on the home
front with Whammy’, a collection
of nine dance numbers that tries
hard to catch the spontaneity of
their early work. Instrumenta-
tion (except for guest sax and

trumpet on one cut) is handled I

entirely by Ricky Wilson and
Keith Strickland. The rest of the
group provide the vocals; Fred
Schneider is in fine rasp, and
Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson
register strongly and in tune.
Production is very clean and
precise, and the mark of the stu-
dio is evident. Missing is the
cheerful, sloppy ease of their
ensemble‘playing——the percus-
sion here is unerringly on-

target, and the overall musical _

effect is calculated, a strong
sense of trying hard to make it
all sound fun. Tales of love,
science fiction, counterfeiting,

A dinner, and bird lifeare included

LIVING IN OZ
Rick Springfield
RCA ’

What's this? Rick Springfield
sporting a two-day growth of
stubble on the cover of his new
album——not to mention tousled
hair, leather vest, and Oh my
gawd...an earring? Has the
school of neo-hardass become
chic or did Rick have a bad day at
the hair salon? Well, really kids,
it's none of the above—Rick
Springfield just wants a. new
audience and on Living In Oz, he
takes the necessary steps to get
it.

Sure the cover ‘picture is
hype, but it's the music inside
that will end up changing the
minds of all those who have

5 poo-pooed Mr. Springfield in

the past as a cute popster. This
album has guts—something
that ”Jessie's Girl" and-"What
Kind of Fool" etc., lacked. Those
songs had good hooks but this
album has a mean jab.

Almost as if attempting to
alienate himself from his high-
school audience, Springfield
seems to have made this album
deliberately risque, both lyri-
cally and musically. Instead of
his past tales of preadolescent
foibles, Living In Oz delves into
adultery, one night stands, and

in the package, and, although
the tunes are a bit less quirky
and memorable, dancing is still
the order of business.

‘ ”Trism," ”Queen’ of Las
Vegas," and ”Shake That

Skirt"—all of side two, in fact———-
qualify as pleasant but undis-
tinguished, with an abundance
of beat but little otherwise. Best
cuts? Taste "Butterbean," actu-
ally about the vegetable, or

plenty of sex. The lyrics do not
mask their intent with
innuendo. Instead, songs like
”Affair Of The Heart," the first
single release, have lyrics like
"When we make love, it's a passionate
thing/You shudder and shake and sink
your teeth in my skin/I almost believe
you were made to be played by my
hands."

Along with the shift in lyrical
content, Springfield's music has
been given a new coat of muscle.
The majority of the songs run at
ar fuel-injected pace and are
loaded with some metallic gui-
tar work by the former Dr.
Noah Drake.

Still, be forewarned that Liv-
ing In Oz is no panacea for Rick
Springfield's teenybopper
blues. Songs like "I Can't Stop
Hurting You" and "Like Father
Like Son" tend to slip back into
pop cliche. Still, this album is a
positive change for Springfield
and will, more thanlikely, turn a
few heads. Finally, Rick Spring-
field seems to be on the right
track...

NONA
Nona Hendryx
RCA _

Nona Hendryx is one of mus-
ic's most diversified, albeit qual-
ified, performers. She's
probably best known for her
work with the short-lived but
successful Labelle, but she's col-
laborated with everyone from
the jazz-funk group Material, to
ex—New York Dolls’ David
Iohansen, to Garland Ieffries,
and even the Talking Heads.
Credentials like those aren't
common.

Nona is her first solo album in
a long time, but it was worth the
wait. Boy, was it worth the wait!

Nona is a collection of gor-
geous songs and arrangements
that combine the best elements
of nearly every category of

 

"Song for a Future Generation,”
a lyrically fun astrological tour
of The B-52's'("HelIo. I'm Cindy;
I'm a Pisces, and I like rhihuahuasand
chinese noodles..."). "Legal Tender”
finds them printing in the base-

ment. The words are undeep, as '

usual, although the jazzy "Big
Bird” tells of "a big bird flying over
the house/and it looks like it's decided to
stay"—could this perhaps be a
topical reference to the threat of

music: funk, soul, new wave,.

synthopop—it's all here, and
rarely has it been done so well.
Hendryx has the ability ‘to slide
from one groove into another
without ever missing a beat. "B-
Boys '5'’ smooth dance—floor
 at

rhythm careens right into the

funkier, political "Living On '

The Border," and that into
”Keep It Confidential,” a softer
ballad written by Ellie Green-
wich and Elden Foley. ”Design
For Living,” side one’s closer, is
unusual not only in its musical
superiority, but also for its all.-
star female” line—up: Gina
Schock, Tina Weymouth,
Nancy. Wilson, Patti LaBelle,
and Laurie Anerson all" lend a
hand.

Side two is every bit as stu-
pefying as the first, but the
stand-outs have to be "Trans-
formation," another cut that
fuses all of_the different faces of
music together, and "Steady
Action,” an almost reggae-ish
number that allows Hendryx to
let go and croon the lusty, soul-
ful notes she's known for.

Nona is fearless in its experi-
mentation, "and perfect in its
outcome. Brilliance is a rare
commodity. You'd be well-
advised to invest.

MURMUR
R.E.M.
IRS

Rarely does
against the fringes of excellence
on its first album release-
usually, artistical maturity is
directly proportional to the size
of a group's record catalogue.
R.E.M. is this year's first excep-
tion to the rule, and it is a most
beautiful exception indeed. ,

Murmur, the band's first full-
length album (the group's debut
was an EP entitled Chronic Town)
is a fascinating album that com-
bines the traditionality of coun-
try music with the dimensional-
ity of today's new music sound.

R.E.M.'s roots lay in Athens,
Georgia, and the region's influ-
ence is apparent. Murmur has a
Nashville twang ‘to it, not to
mention plenty of acoustic gui-
tar patterns that are rich with
southern dialect. At moments,
as on "Catapult," the sound is
coyly reminiscent of . early
Byrd's music. However,
R.E.M.'s rhythm section pre-
vents Murmur from simply
being a country album. The
heavy backbeat and often rav-
aging bass charts (hear ”9-9" for

-a real good example) separate

this music from the south and
move it north for a more mod-
ern sound. R.E.M.'s music is like
a shot of. good whiskey: it
warms going down and then it
kicks in the head,

While Chronic Town was a bit
repetitive, Murmur doesn't have
a bad song on it. It is the album's
first song, ”Radio Free Europe,"
though, that ends up being the
best cut.

Murmur is an excellent album
that establishes R.E.M. as a
band to make a fuss about.
Their second album should be
even more interesting, though
with an effort the caliber of
Murmur, who needs a second
release?

Jack  
 Spratt
Flat
Falls

By LINDA HENRY

Closing the season of the Fine Line
Theatre Company is a play called"
Spratt by Joe Weisenfeld‘, running
through June 12th at the Famous
Rider Theatre in Oakland. Thiscom—
pany is known for taking risks, doing
modern plays and often producing
local premieres. An exciting and
refreshing concept that can also by
deadly. Spratt isdeadly theatre.

There is nothing appealing about
the main character, Jack Spratt, who
tumbles from one sales job to another
(in this story losing his job selling
‘plastic flowers), falls in and out of
bars where he cracks crude and
chauvanistic jokes, and is a chronic

, gambler and liar. As if this wasn't
enough, on the day he loses his job he

‘ gets arrested for ”sexual intercourse
with the feeble-minded" (raping a

I woman who is a mental patient). We
find out,‘ through theunraveling of
events, that he did not actually ”make
it” with Marlie, the woman in ques-
tion, but it's difficult to be sympa-
thetic about his plight, as I assume
somewhere between the lines we are
supposed to feel compassion for this
ultimate jag—off.

champagne in the nude with Marlie,
his wife is at home agonizing over
impending surgery for a biopsy of an
ovarian cyst. When Spratt is told of
this he replies, ’'I don't want to hear
anymore about this cancer bullshit.”
Later we do find out that he reacts
this way because he is scared. We are
supposed to believe he truly loves
Dorrie, his wife. Like Stanley loves
Stella, perhaps. .
The problem is that Spratt is dispi-
cable and Bruce Kirkpatrick plays his
repulsive characteristics so well there
is no room for belief that somewhere
under there is a good ol’ guy. _
Tammy Bouzos is the saving grace
of the production as Dorrie, Spratt’s
emotionally abused wife. She
deserves a wife of the year award for
staying in character opposite such a
tedious brute. Her performance is
near perfect, giving more to her part
than any role in this play deserves.
Other performances were not as
consistent. Chris Josephs, Spratt’s
best friend and lawyer. Eddie, weaves
in and out of believability. Nita Ling’s
Marlie, though endearing, is stereo-
typical of someone playing mentally
ill rather than actuakly being
disturbed. __ (
Robert Reusch and Tom Lehner
played multiple roles and were best in
their biggest parts as bad-cop/good-
cop team of Fox and Plover. Joan
Kimmel as the woman, another
multiple-role part, gave fine‘"perfor-
mances as a secretary, policewoman

and most notably a waitress who \

must suffer Spratt’s verbal abuse in
one scene.

In all, company artistic director
Robert Koch ‘made an interesting
attempt of presenting this character
study with a sparse set, bare necessi-
ties of props and lighting designed to

‘spotlight Jack. The problem is, this

character is not worthy of exposure.

Before Return of the Jedi was released,
last week, Flashdance was the film
industry's top grosser for three
weeks in a row. An amazing fact con-
sidering that the movie is little more
than a slick little pieceof trash—all

flash, no substance. The only things
worth, seeing in it are four dance
scenes where there is no acting and
none of I-'lashdance's actors to muck
them up—just professional dancers,
deafening music, and death-defying
choreography.’ One of these sequen-
ces is now being shown on MTV, with
more to follow, which is a good rea-
son not to see the mOvie—stay home
and watch the good parts in the pri-

FROG RAISING

by the American Frog Canning
Company

Dell

“Frogs have comical expressions
that never fail to fascinate young
and old people alike.” Even if that
statement was fact, why would Dell
reissue a complete facsimile edition
of the 1937 guide to Frog Raising?
Perhaps it’s funny because the orig-
inal text was entirely serious and
straightforward in intent.

“This book presents the true
facts about frogs and frog raising,”
explains the forward to the 1937
guide. The American Frog Canning
Company (headquarters in New
Orleans) fervently believed that
America’s culinary future
depended on the frog.

Frog Raising is certainly a newsy
little book. The text is curiously
morbid, as the processes involved
in the cultivation of frogs are
explained step-by-step, from birth
through tadpolehood and straight
through to the end. That's when the
frog farmer decapitates the little
amphibians, squeezes their guts
out (presumably like toothpaste),
and sends them off to the packing
plant. From there they go straight
to your kitchen table.

Related material is included—
recipes and information about the
scientific research market and var-

H ious by-products of frogs (shoes,

glue, key rings). The guide is gener-
ously illustrated, and readers are
urged to order, through the mail,
five sets of breeding frogs and the

frog Culture. . A
Apparently, since the guide had
been outof print for nearly 45 years,
the frog business didn’t catch the
public’s fancy, and the reasons why
seem obvious. It's an unattractive
and rather silly proposition. The
1937 Frog Raising guide is not with-
out historical interest, but as

there is more humor in the idea (a

tion of it.

However misdirected, Frog Rais-
ing resulted from serious effort on
behalf of the American Frog Can-

appears ludicrous, the book is too
desperately sincere to qualify as
successful light humor. One’ won-

laughter has guilty underpinnings.

I on THE WALL STREET JOUR-

NAL II
Hendra Associates, Inc.

This looks real. It fools a lot of
people, but there are a couple clues.
The "off" and the "the" promote sus-
picion, as does the price code at the
bottom of the front page-—and what
about the conspicuous photographs?
Ah—-—but this is the Off The Wall Street
Iournal 11, another on-target parody
from the folks who brought us the
first OTWS]. Successful and tho-
rough parody is hard work, but
they've done it over again. An Amer-
ican institution is slammed here; it’s
minor blasphemy, but the sin is
forgiveable.

This is the "Huge Recovery lssue,”
dated April 15 (the date has some-
thing vaguely to do with taxes), and
it is similar in content and style to
the real Wall Street fournal. "What's
News” becomes "What! News?”
‘Front-page stories report on the new
ballistic bishops operating out of

Rome as spiritual weapons and also

on the introduction of "a chemical
' ” into
the pages of‘ the pages of the Iournal.

”l~'ighting around the world fell

27 million for the previousday.”
"Corrections ’

dead, as was reported in an earlier
edition.” The ads are deceptive: Dou-
ble Cross pens with disappearing ink
are. designed so that "one can get
what one wants now without having
to pay for it later.” Rumors say that
MGM will abandon its 40-year
experiment with talking pictures in
favor of silent ones. "New Study
Shows Teens Prefer B--ting M--t To
Playing Atari Games.” Twnety-four
pages comprise the issue, and every-
thing comes in for its share of
lampoon—world and U.S. news, bus-
iness, entertainment, sports, and
most of it is wickedly funny.

The parody issue naturally _ is
aimed at the regular [carnal reader
with a sense of humor—an audience
which it may not reach. But Off The
Wall is aptly titled and a good
extended joke, even for those unfam-
iliar with the layout and the work-
ings of the real fournal.

1983 GUINNESS BOOK OF‘

Edited by Norris McWhirter
Bantam Books

Remember your first time? You

the fourth grade. You had to wait
because it was the most popular book
in the library, but finally it was your
turn, and you had it for a whole

week. You took it home and read it

avidly and bored anyone who would
listen with never-ending and unusa-
ble facts about the highest, longest,
oldest, most, best, biggest, fastest....

There's a new one out again: the
1983 Guinness Book of World Records,
edited as usual by Norris McWhirter,
updating his 1982 edition (which
updated the 1981 copy, which
improved upon the 1980 version and
so on and so on, since 1956). It is
unique; there ought to be an entry in
it for Most Copies of a Practically
Pointless Reference Book Sold-
over 50 million and still rising.

Still, the appeal of this compen-
dium of trivia is undeniable. Any
Guinness is easy to get lost in, and the
1983 edition is "the biggest...ever,"
according to its cover. The rules and
procedures—is it really a record?--—
are explained in the preface for
anyone interested in seeking admi-t-
tance, and as always, this book is
divided conveniently into chapters
by topic: the human being, the natu-
ral world, arts, science and various
other categories.

By far, the most intriguing sec-
tions are "Human Achievements”
and "Sports Games and Pastimes."

After all, isn't life a series of endu-

rance marathons? Guinness gives
credit where it's due. One fellow ate
62 six-inch pancakes (with butter
and syrup) in six minutes and 58.5

thon to beat is 337 hours and 20 min-
utes.
surprisingly persuasive, too—makes
you want to shatter one of the
records and leave your mark in one of
the Guinness books.

All homes should have one, and ,
they probably do, although Guinness’

books are like encyclopedias-—

nobody buys a new set every year, -

despite all the new information it
may contain. But like its numerous
brothers, the -1983 Guinness Book of
World Records is fascinating browsing
territory.

EPPIE: THE STORY OF AN
LANDERS "_ ‘
By Margo Howard A A
Pinnacle Books

The maximum-strength Who
Cares? biography.’ Ann Landers, "a
square Iewish girl from Iowa,” is an
advice columnist, and everyone is
aware of it. Her twin sister, Abigail
Van Buren,
coIumnist——more old news. Ann
Landers (or Esther Pauline Fried-
man) married one Jules Lederer, pro-
duced a daughter, Margo, and got
divorced in the mid-1970s. Recently,
Miss Landers has been taken to task

for recycling old letters which she

considered topical and rerunning
them in her column. Oh, oh-—pass
the smellingsalts. ‘

"It's all here...” says the book.

i Everything you never wanted to

know about the subject can be found
in Eppie: The Story of Ann Landers,
authored by her daughter, also a syn-
dicated columnist. ”Eppie," by the
way, is Landers’ nickname; the book

details her early life, later rivalry ~

with her sister and the particulars
surrounding her job (when the Chi-
cago Sun-Times’ Ann Landers died,
Eppie Lederer won the name and the
position). The divorce is here, also.
Yawn. , ,

Eppie provides undeniably easy
reading, devoid of any advice column
guidance or even "real, untold”-type
gossip. Howard's style is more con-
versationally informal than literary.
The reader is treated to such astute
analysis as "Mother seemed ieiune at
times, with her enthusiasms and her
sense of mission." Absent from the
proceedings is something vital:' a
purpose. At no time is it explained
why Ann Landers’ story needs tell-
ing. A celebrity biography in the
worst sense, Eppie is little more than
an exercise in non-fiction. "Anyone
can give advice," the author had said
at one point; "Mother turned into
America's umpire,” writes Howard.
But does anyone care to know?

Fall Short

By CHARLIE O'HARA

The Georgetown Invitational,
held at University of Maryland’s
Byrd Stadium, was to have been the
final opportunity for Panther mid-
dle distance runners Todd Colas and
Terry Gallagher to qualify for the
NCAA Championship meet.

The weather conditions were just
right if either Colas or Gallagher had
it in themselves.

“We brought Garland [Brown] to
pace Todd [Colas] through the first
550 [meters],” Panther coach John
Vasvary said. “The weather was fine.
Everything was fine."

Everything except the result.

Colas missed the NCAA qualify-
ing standard by two tenths of a
second as he raced to victory with a
time of 1248.0.

Gallagher was able to manage a
time of 1:49.

Placement wasn’t the realizing
that the sole purpose of the trip was
to come away with a time that would
qualify.

“It wouldn’t matter if Todd fin-
ished sixth, just so long as he quali-
fied," Vasvary said.

For Colas, the collegiate season
and competition are completed until
his senior year, and for Gallagher,
collegiate competition is over. There
are rumors that Gallagher will stay
in the area and compete as a member
of the New Image Track Club.

NCAA PREVIEW: Despite the
gallant efforts put forth this past
weekend in College Park, Md., one
Panther is presently preparing for
his qualifying heats at the NCAA

of NCAAs

meet being held at the campus of the
University of Houston.

Sophomore Roger Kingdom, will
compete in the 110-meter high
hurdles.

Kingdom will be facing as tough a
field of hurdlers as can be assembled
in the country. ,

The favorites entering the meet
are defending champion Milan
Stewart of Southern California,
Willie Gault of Tennessee, the
indoor 60-yard hurdle and dash
champ, and Rodney Wilson of Vil-
lanova, I979 national champ and
1980 runner-up.

“It’s without a doubt a group of
top flight hurdlers," Vasvary said.
“But don’t count Roger out. On any
given day, he can compete with any
of those guys. Let’s just hope that
given day is this weekend.” .

His qualifying time of 13.64 ranks
among the top times recorded all
season by anyone in the country. In
fact, Wilson of Villanova’s 1983 best
doesn’t compare to Kingdom’s
mark.

The hurdle championship in the
United States often times, breeds the
future Olympic and World Cup
Champions.

“The competition is tough," Vas-
vary said. “Most of the time, first,
second and third in the United
States means ranking first, second
or third in the world. There aren’t
too many hurdle champions outside

of the US.”

Kingdom looks to gain All-
American honors—finishing in the
top six—while maintaining an out-
side shot at the title.

World University

Games:

Goes English Route

By scon DELLETT

Clyde Vaughan was a basket-

ball player without a country for
which to play. The 6-4 senior for-
ward was looking forward to
play for the United States in the
Pan—American games this
summer. There was one catch——
he was born in England.

Though he was planning to
gain citizenship in July, Vaughan
would still have been ineligible to
play for the United States. Rules
state that one must have been a
citizen for three years to play for
a national team.

But instead of being left out,
Vaughan will perform against
international competition. The‘
British invited Vaughan to par-
ticipate for England in the World
University games in Edmonton,
July l—l2.

Vaughan was allowed to
become a U.S. citizen several
years ago, but he never got
around to declaring.

“I never gave it a second
thought,” ne said. “It didn't
occur to me that I would be play-
ing in the PanAm games or the
Olvmnics.

Vaughan will be playing
against 30 countries, including
the United States, the Soviet
Union and Yugoslavia. in the
World University games.

When international basketball
powers are mentioned. England
is generally ignored. However.

aughan

England finished tenth in last
year's games.

“I can’t tell how good they
are,” Vaughan said ofhis English
teammates. “They have played
against top competition.

"I do think I will be better.”

Vaughan’s United States citi-
zenship may be held off depend-
ing on how well the England
team performs at the games.

“If I like the team at the World
Championships, then I'll put off

my citizenship and play for Eng-,

land in the I984 Olympics," he
said.

Certainly the Olympics were a
far way off when Vaughan came
to the Pitt campus in I980. A
230—lb. freshman, he saw little
action, scoring only seven points
a game. After taking off weight,
Vaughan showed marked
improvement in his sophomore
year, leading the then-Eastern
Eight in scoring.

After being part ofa Big East
squad which travelled to Spain
and Yugoslavia-~ he led the
squad in scoring with a I3-point
per game averagem Vaughan
continued his success. leading
the Big East conference in scor-
ing, averaging 22 points a contest
last season.

Vaughan and the English team
will tune up before the garrles,
facing teams from the United
States. Yugoslavia and Mexico.
starting June 25in Kansas City.

Unqualilied as an American, Forward Clyde Vaughan will find
room to compete on the English squad.

Allderdice Dragons

By MARK A. SINDLER

 the school bus descended

steeply sloping West St. in Homes-
tead, several occupants screamed in
unison, “When do we get our
jackets?”

The 17 members of the Taylor
Allderdice High School Dragons
baseball team will soon be wearing
the jackets which proclaim them
City League champions following
their 6-5 victory over Langley yester-
day at West Field.

_ After squandering a five-run lead
in the fifth and sixth innings, Allder-
dice capitalized on a key wild pitch

/‘in the bottom of the seventh to

unknot the tie and go on to victory.

Shortstop Duke Lamanti keyed

the top of that inning by being hit on

‘his left shoulder by reliever Jim
Johnson. After junior Tommy
Johnson popped up to second base-
man Ron Martin, Duke’s twin,
Dave, sent a screaming line drive
single up the middle as Duke
advanced to third.

This set the stage for sophomore
catcher Auggie Lagnese, as Drag-
ons’ coach Jim Dunlap instructed
him to go for the suicide squeeze on
the second pitch.

Although squared away for the
bunt, Lagnese never executed the

Osqueeze play since Johnson, a right-
I handed hurler, threw high and inside

just enough for the ball to graze the
top of Mustang catcher Jim Nelson’s
mitt and roll about 25 feel beyond
reach. Duke Lamanti, already danc-
-ing up and down the third base line,
raced home with the winning run.
Said a frazzled-looking Lagnese
afterward, “[Dunlay] told me,

squeeze. He said do anything you
can to lay it down and keep the bat
up to protect the runner, too.”

The dramatic finish paradoxically
summed up the first three and a half
innings, which were completed in
under an hour. Langley starter Ron
King retired the Dragons on four
pitches in the third inning as evi-
dence of the rapid play.

This after Lagnese, one inning
earlier, had launched an infield sin-
gle off of King’s left shoulder and
forced King to think twice about
continuing his starting role.

His third inning masterpiece
aside, King should have pondered
the possibility more thoroughly as
the Dragons sent 10 men to the plate
in the fourth inning, en route to a 5-0
lead compliments of five hits and
two errors.

After Dave Lamanti and Johnson
startedthe barrage with a walk and a
single to right field, Lamanti sent a
line drive to right, scoring Duke.
Lagnese then laid down a neat
squeeze bunt, scoring the
previously—advanced Johnson and
sending Dave to second base.

With right fielder Tony Patter-
son’s sacrificing, Lagnese and
Lamanti advanced one base each.
With center fielder Kent Davis’ bat-
ting, Lamanti was sent home.

_Now 3-0, Davis sent a lightning
grounder past third baseman Frank
.Madia’s reach, permitting Lagnese
to score. After Davis stole second
and designated hitter Mark Van
Buskirk executed the inning’s third
bunt, the center fielder easily crossed A
home plate after second baseman
Pam Soboslay sent a ricochet off
Mustang infielder Martin.

in Section I play, seemed to have
total control of the game at this
point, but the squad did not account
for the stiffness that Johnson, a 7-0
pitcher on the year, acquired while

, the Dragons batted for over 20

minutes. ,

That inflexibility is a plausible
explanation for Langley’s sending
eight men to the plate and scoring
four runs in the fifth inning.

“He felt he was losing some of the
stuff he went out there to throw
with," assistant coach Rick DeSano
said of Johnson _after he was
replaced by Lamanti in the sixth
inning. “His curve wasn’t as sharp
and his fastball wasn’t as quick.”

Johnson said, “I wasjout for a
while and sitting [in the dugout]. I
wasn't throwing. I should have been
warming up, but I got tight and
threw a little wild. But we came back

~ ‘to beat them.”

The Mustangs, owners of a 13-1
regular season record, literally plun-
dered Johnson’s offerings after
designated hitter Jim Johnson
struck out. Left fielder Jeff Bachner
then walked and advanced to second
when pinch hitter John Hirschfield
[for King] reached base on a fielder’s
choice after third baseman Al Hend-

Lasso Langley For League Title

dropped by Soboslay.

Two more singles, a double, a
walk and a wild pitch allowed Lan-
gley to catch up before Nelson, the
catcher, struck out to end the inning.

Langley could have easily taken
command of the game in the seventh
inning when Allderdice outfielder
Patterson misjudged a ﬂy off Mus-
tang center fielder Eric DeJohn, a

.457 hitter. Now at second after an .

earlier sacrifice bunt, DeJohr_i was
caught 35 feet off‘ the bag when
shortstop Lou Henry’s fly to Davis

was caught and thrown to Soboslay I

for the double play.

The inning, and the game, was
overfor Langley.

Yesterday’s title game proved that
the Dragons were not accustomed to
carrying fat leads, and that, Sobos-
lay explained, could have actually
given Langley the win.

“We played well,” he said, “except
for the fifth; I thinkwe let up a little
bit. We made too many mental mis-
takes then. But once we realized
where we were, we got back on the
right track and came back to win it.”

Dunlap, the Allderdice skipper in
his ninth year, liked what he saw in
the early innings, but admitted that
Johnson’s stiffening gave the Mus-
tangs an extra edge in fighting back.

“The first four for us were well

“Jphnson had that long delay,
wasn’t loose enough and was a little
