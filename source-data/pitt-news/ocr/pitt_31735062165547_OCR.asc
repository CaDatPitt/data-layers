Student Aid
F orms Due

November 15

Students, intending to ap-

ply for student aid for, the
winter trimester should sub-
mit their completed applica-
tions to the Office of Student
Aid, 1.16, SU,-— by_ November
15, according to Jack B. Critch-

ﬁeld, director of student aid.

Students who received either
scholarships .or loans‘ for the fall
and winter term need ‘not reapply
at this time, he said, "but ,must
reapply for next year or for the
spring trimester. v

Applications for the spring tri-’- ’

meste are «due March 1, and

those for next year ,on.April 15. .

“To insure consideration, appli-

. cants should strictly adhere to

the deadline dates," 'Critchﬁeld

_ emphasized.

Funds Increased‘ 1
According to Critchﬁeld, the
student aid funds have been in-
creased to help Vmeet the tuition

_ incr"ea:'se. “Attempts are also being

made to increase the scholarship
and loan budget,” he stated.

The major sources of under-,
graduate funds come from the
University scholarships, gift,
supported scholarships, endow-
ed scholarships, National A De"-
fense loans, and ‘University stu-
dent loans.

“The University student loans
were inaugurated to help meet the
increased demands of the student
body for more funds. Most stu-
dents accepted the loans, or re-
jected them because of the terms
of the loan, which included a ﬁve
percent interest rate,” stated
Critchﬁeld, _ .

Bill Shelved

The status of P a federal "bill

would aid student funds has been

A shelved, according to Litchﬁeld.

 

 

A 3.0

“Any aid through the federal gov.-
ernment would be beneﬁcial,” he
continued. “No college can receive
more than a quarter of a million
dollars in national defense funds
and we are alreadyreceiving the
max1mum.”

Students must maintain a 2.75
QPA in order to keep or receive-
University

for Umversity. or national

scholarships and as '

 
  

etvill "have the opportunity to see
drama of every variety,” Ulrich
said.‘ ’

He predicted ‘that because, The-
'atre presentations now “do not
have to compete with other enter-
tainment ~media for- students’
money,” attendance at its pro-
ductions will increase. Ulrich also
suggested that an increase in at-
tendance would also mean an in-
crease in the number of students
interested in participating in Uni-
versity Theatre productions._ ‘

Systems For Tickets

A system is being devised to
give the student tickets through
their invoices and to give mem-
bers of the faculty V and admin-
istration tickets through special
identiﬁcation cards, ‘he said.

,The new policy is a continua-
"tion of a program which began
last September, when all the-

»ater work at the University,
along ‘with the department of
speech and ‘theatre arts, was

- placed under .the direction of
‘the newly created "University
Theatre. ‘

According to Ulrich, Charles ‘H.
Peake, vice-chancellor of the Aca-
demic Disciplines; Dr.‘ ‘Alan , C.
Rankin, assistant chancellor for
Student and General Affairs; Wil-
liam B. Crafts, dean of men; and
Jack Matthews, chairman of the
speech department, also, worked
on formulating the new policy.

To Satisfy All '

“I am hoping that the scope and
depth of the University Theatre
will satisfy the potential needs of
all students andfaculty towards
theatre work,” Ulrich stated.

The first University Theatre
production in cooperation with
the music department, Gilbert
and Sullivan’s “Mikado,” will be
performed, under the free ad-
mission policy. Performers are
scheduled for the last week of-
November.

Ulrich, who will stage the oper-
etta, has noted that this is the
first time a‘ work by Gilbert and
Sullivan has been performed at
the University.

 NewtDental Assistant Program   AWS Freshnlen K;

Girls Fill Critical Gaps

  

~ By BONNIE BUHL
“On Friday I was wishing there were class on Saturday,”
says Susan Pheile, student at the University’s School of
Dentistry training program for dental assistants.
Classes are “difficult but challenging,” she saysfadding

that she appreciates the fact

that teachers take time to

listen to the students’ problems and iron out diﬁ'iculties.'

Another student, Marty Olson,‘
feels that it is the “fmest course”
of its kind in which she could be
enrolled, and believes that most
of the students feel the same way.

,Both girls are enthusiastic about
their courses, their professors, the
new friends they are making, and
the future opportunities which the
program will provide for them.
Has Capacity

The dental assistant program,
which at present has its capacity
‘of 24 students enrolled, is a direct
result of U.S. government interest.

‘In 1954 the American Asso- .
ciation of Dental Assistants, the
American Dental Association,
and the Bureau of Health, Edu-
cation, and Welfare started and
ﬁnanced a project of pilot pro-
grams in six universities. The
program, which has since ex-
panded, now includes the Uni-
versity’s School of Dentistry.

Dr. Federbush, public relations
representative for the School of
Dentistry, believes that the need
for such a program has been stim-
ulated by the long existent over-
load of patients and the lack of
training facilities in private or-
ﬂees.

It has also been expected he
said, that the. expanding popula-
tion will create even greater de-
mands on the dentist, making the
role ot the dental assistants more
essential.

The program, which is the
first of its kind in Pennsylvania,
.is still in the pioneering and
experimental stage of its devel-
opment. It consists of a full year
of training at 40 hours a week

   

.9

A dentistry,”

for a $500 tuition plus uniform
and textbook costs, and is under
the direction of Dr. Edward
Forrest, Dean of the School of
Dentistry.

According to Dr. Helen Morgart,
supervisor and coordinator of the
program, it is a “team approach to
training both dental
assistants and dental students to
work with each other. Dr. Mor-
gart feels that the students are
“all very much interested in the
work” and are receiving “a good
background in dentistry.”

Caliber Praised

“I have been congratulated on
the caliber of the students,” she
says, speaking of the 24 young
women, who are between the ages
of 18 and 22. Some have been to
college, business school, or nurses’

training, while others are recent

high school graduates.

Among admision requirements
for the program are-satisfactory
completion of high school with a
grade average of “C” or better,
compatibility, neatness of ap-
pearance, desire to work with
facial and oral health problems,
and the maturity to accept re-
sponsibility, according ‘to Dr.
Morgart.

The dental assistant program
will present opportunities for
graduates in institutional service,
in education, and in administra-
tion, she explains. With the com-
pletion of two additional years of
experience and by passing a cer-
tifying examination, graduates
may ‘qualify for certiﬁcation by
the American Association of Den-
tal Assistants.

Midday Speaker Discusses Toxic Literature

‘Freedom Takes Suffering’

By NANCY FUCHS
“I like American students.
With them, I don’t have to
break the barrier of fear
which European students so

often have of their school-'

masters.”

With this entirely unprovoked
statement, Dr. Jakob Amstutz, the
Swiss philosopher who spoke at
Midday Series last Friday, began
his informal interview. Nervously

smoking his- American cigarettes,.

the slightly built, balding ‘philo-
sopher spoke, with contagious en-
thusiasm. ‘

Within a short space of time, he
gave his impressions of America,

~ American students vs. European,

Switzerland, and told some of his
personal experiences.
_ Berne Philosopher
Dr. Amstutz _is a professor of

philosophy at the University of.

Berne, and a guest lect_urer at A1-
bert Schweitzer College in Swit-

zerland, an experimental college

with an international makeup of
40 students, who come from 12

countries for at year of a liberal

arts curriculum. A ‘minister of the
Swiss Church, he isthe director
of religious‘ broadcasting for the
canton of_Berne_. ‘

Fluent in German, French,
and Italian, Dr. Amstutz didnot
learn English until 1956, and did
not appreciate the beauty iof the
English language until he heard
Dylan Thomas’ recording of his
play, Under Milkwood, I

Since this is his third lecture
tour of the United States, Dr.
Amstutz has formed s0me‘fascin-
ating opinions about American
students. .

Feels Advantage

He feels that it is an advantage
that American students are so
fresh when they come to college,
as far as exposure to difficult
studies is concerned.

Dr. Amstutz also says, “It is
quite refreshing to have Ameri-
can. students because they are
not hampered by too much his-

nn. JACOB AMSTUTZ
‘No Barrievi of Fear’

torical knowledge. Europeans"
can’t talk ﬁve minutes. without
quoting an authority.” _

He loves. ‘New England because
“the people have roots in the
ground, the landscape is like
northern Switzerland,’ and in my
favorite city, Boston, you can. ac-
tually feel history.” .

_‘ One Language

To him it is “boring that in such
a big country only one language
is spoken.” German, French, and
Italian are all spoken in Switzer-
land. ,

Dr. Amstutz ‘is amazed by
American indifference toward
politics when it is not election
time. In Switzerland, everyone
is involved in politics because
the citizens have the power of
referendum. ' -

Like the ancient Roman, who
considered himself ‘primarily Ro-

never says he’ is Swiss when he is
traveling in Europe. He calls him-
self Genevese. -

Toxic Effect «

In his lecture on “Sickness,
Evil, and Theology with . Sartre,
Camus, and Kafka,” Dr. Amstutz
discussed the effect of toxic litera-
ture on the reader.

_ He said that the internal com-
pulsion of sickness is the “lack
of inner control of man,” and
that “evil is the external com-I
p u l s i o n which dehumanizes
mani’ Books with unhealthy in-
ﬂuence have always,been writ-
ten.

Today, however, writers do not
want to urge their readers into
the three sicknesses of snobbish-
ness, defeatism, and theologic
doubts. Instead, they intend to
show man how he is destroying
his freedom. According to Sartre’s

_existentialism, “Man is only what

hemakes of himself. Hecan only
be free if he decides that he will
be and is willing to suffer."

Dr. Amstutz also‘ discussed the
atheistic ethics of Camus and Sar-
tre, neither of whom are theo-
logians. Whereas Sartre believes

that God is merely a projection,

Kafka, the. theologian, believes
that “the highest moral authority
lies. within man himself."

  PennsylvaniaPolitics

alcohol proposal came as no surprise. What is interesting

to note, however, is that pollsters have reported that dormi- V

ytory students and fraternity members appeared to have
been genuinely sincere in their voting. The Student Gov-
ernment representatives added that almost everyone seem-
‘ed-well informed on the various aspects of the proposal
and" many were prepared with intelligent questions con-
cerning the future of the alcohol issue.

The question of student support, which the administra-
tion used as its primary basis for rejecting the last alcohol
proposal, is now clearly answered. The student body def-
initely wants alcohol on campus and ﬁrmly believes it can
accept all responsibilities that would accompany its arrival.
The future of the proposal, therefore, should be determin-
ed as soon as possible.

There is no reason why Student Government should
not approve the. student body’s overwhelming decision.

There is no reason why the proposal should not be sub-
mitted to the University as soon as this approval is made.

And there is no reason why alcohol should not be per-
mitted on campus. , V

Reason may exist, however, for the rejection of this
proposal. As has been pointed out in this newspaper recent-
ly, the alcohol bill does contain several ﬂaws in wording and
perhaps even in logic.‘ But being generally well construct-
ed, thetproposal can be altered in points if it is rejected on
the basis of technicalities. ,

These things are minor. The fact remains that there is
no solid reason for banning the consumption of alcoholic
beverages here as permitted under Pennsylvania law. '

This can be illustrated by the “other type” of student
support for campus drinking which has been exhibited for
many years. It is an open secret that soft drink-spiking is
traditional at football games; that organizations’ oﬁice
parties have often been highlighted by spirited toasts; that
hip—pocket flasks are still in style. ' ‘ ‘ 4

Rarely if ever has such activity led to improper be-

havior. The only unfortunate result of this illegal drinking '

is an occasional feeling of guilt.

Because students have shown they both want alcohol
on campus and can behave properly, and because no real
reason has been presented to justify its banishment, we
fully endorse the idea of legalizing alcoholic beverages at
the University.

The avalanche of affirmation for Student Government's

Bill Scranton Promises

End to ‘Power Politics’

By THOMAS BAKER
OncNovember 6, the voters will elect the next
governor of Pennsylvania. We needuan HONEST,
dependable man -for this office. Bill Scranton is

such a" man. For 15 years he has been a leader in

the effort‘ of depression-rocked north-eastern Penn-
sylvania to pull itself “out by t'hé:‘bootstraps.” V
Scranton has promised to bring": an end‘ .10
,“Power Politics“ and create an honest Civil Serv-
ice System. ’_He. also would stop ‘waste "in I-Iarris—

. burg, relieve the state payroll, and --state, SUll>DO'i_lt.
of political 'parties,'’ and“-get the~State Police and ‘

mental health‘ program" out‘ of politics.

Scrantonalso -promises to investigate the Bureau,
of Professional“Licensing which was “one of‘ the

most corrupt and scandal-ridden agencies of state
government during the"Lawrence Administration.”

Educational Legislation Lacking’ _ _ _

Our efforts in higher education are classed as
number 48 in the 50 states. Scranton would change
the School Reorganization Act to make it work, in-
crease teachers’ salaries, improve public schools
and expand college facilities.

We also need an honestly-balanced budget.
Lawrence has balanced the budget‘ only by impos-
ing several hundred million dollars in new taxes,
accelerated‘ tax payments,. and by juggling other
payments and receipts; ‘ g

In every department of state government, Bil

Scranton's program calls for progress not politics,’
action not alibis. If he is elected,ehe will be our

greatest governor since Gifford_=Pinchot.

Richardson Dilworth, hand} picked 1 by party ‘

bosses behind closed doors, is ”Scranton’s opponent.
Dilworth is proud of such deeds as: blocking a
grand jury probe of multi-million dollar corruption
in Philadelphia; forcing Michael H. Sura/to resign

from a city post (later appointed director of Phila-

delphia mint by JFK); ﬁring two women on civil

service who_ were later given back their jobs and-

$2,500,in_back pay;‘ permittingthe big crooks to
remain in control of city hall; -andﬂbeing forced to
resign as deputy attorney general of Pennsylvania
in 1933 for what former Governor, Earle described
as “neglect of duty.” c , _ A

Is this the_ kind of man that ‘will attract new
business to Pennsylvania?‘ Is this the kind of man
that the hgiest, ordinary citizen ‘can-trust — or for

that matter that anyone can trust? ‘Is thisthe man .

that Pitt University wants? I don’t think it; is. We
must all work together to defeat Dick Dilworth by
voting for Bill Scranton this November. '

Dilworth Stresses Need

For Unemployment Solution

By DAVE MENZER

Richardson Dilworth will continue to keep our
state moving’ forward. The impetus for this drive
will come from the great accomplishments of the
previous eight years of-Democratic administrations.
, Both candidates for the chief executive office in
the state stress unemployment as the chief issue 
the campaign, and both emphasize the’ need for
attracting new industry asnthe major solution. But,
yvearsyriofp Republican neglect have done little. or

nothing to aid the ‘st‘ate’s_ sickly economy.
However, the vitality. of the program advanced

..by the two Democratic administrations can clearly

be _seen_ essay: The "Pennsylvania Industrial De-
velopment -zgsnithority, created over the opposition of
Republi_cans- in the legislature has brought over

£1,000 new job ~‘opportu'n'ities to areas of high un-3?
"employment. ‘The state Chamber of Commerce,
‘ hardly atool of the Democratic Party, claims that

Pennsylvania today has an extremely healthy cli-
mate for new industry.

While it is afact that there are a great number
of appointive jobs in/the "state, the Republicans
gloss over ‘many facts,_trying to hide them from the
voters of our state.’ ( 1) Underithe Democratic ad-
ministrations, more persons were placed under civil
service than during any comparable period in his-
tory. (2) According to the U. s. Department ' or
Labor, Pennsylvania has the lowest number of state
employees, per population, of any other state in the
union,nand (3) Richardson Dilworth had pledged
to put approximately one-half of state employees
under an effective civil service program._

Favors Expanldedi Contributions

Richardson Dilworth stands for expanded state
contributions to education on all levels. He once
more will attempt to get a program of community

I

colleges throughout the state, andstate scholarships, ‘  A

and loans to college students through the legisla-
ture. There, Republicans have blocked passage of
similar proposals in -the past sessions. , '~

Even with such; staunch/Republican opposition \_

to progressive programs, the Democratic admini-
strations have almost doubled the -amount of state
f‘mdS_ ‘C0 education, _d0l_1bled,’ the ‘number of miles
of. highway ..bu1lt, ' planned -state park facilities

planned‘ modern mental health care, provided edu-
cational facilities for the exceptional child. and. in“
general have modernized the archaic state_govern‘-‘-
ment which "existed previously. . V"

n Building on the past eight years of pi'ogi~e;s_sive
state government by using his experience as mayor
of America’s most exciting city government, "Rich,

ardson Dilworth will be the best governor in
.Pennsylvania’s history.

Rockwell Pitied c
By ‘Sympat_hizer'

Editor, The Pitt News

Re: Administration N a y 5
Speech by Neo—Nazi;.Octo_ber 1

issue The Pitt News‘. ' -

The fundamental problem of
the Fifth Floor Lecture Series
has been overlooked, I fear, in
a fuss over freedom of speech,
which is not at issue at all. The
people involved ,were carried
away by emotional considera-
tions of their own, rather than
those of their proposed speaker.

The rather spectacular and
tragic psychic condition which
afﬂicts this man has never been
mentioned. It would seem that
publicity can wreak great dam-
age to one in his condition, as
it apparently already has.

In addition, there is a certain
infectiousness in it, as evi-
denced by the fact that he is
not without “followers,” pre-
sumably people with a low re-
sistance to this kind of malaise.

In "the interests of sympathy
towards the afiiicted, therefore,
I feel he should be left alone to
recuperate as best he can, with-
out our causing his illness to as-
sert itself here. ‘

Whatever_ feelings of animos-

       

iity we may feel toward him

shou_ld‘be amply gratiﬁed by the
knowledge that even with our
consideration, others will not be
so kind, and" will probablyaid
in maintaining the disease which

he is so, evidentally powerless‘

to resist.

‘The Buckley Brigade’
Attacked By Student

Editor, the Pitt News
Re: Mr. Kleinberg’s review of
“National Review” (“The Buck-‘

ley Brigade,” The Pitt News, Oct.
15.

“Buckley’s specialty,” clever
sarcasm, is one vehicle by which
one aspect of truth is so advo-
cated as to be listmed to. Man-

. ner of presentation should be

logically separated from the con-
tent presented, however. Mr,
Buckley’s sarcasm and wit as-
sures us of neither the truth nor
the falsity of his views.

Likewise the “frustration” and
“hate” which Mr. Kleinberg
finds in Conservatism bears no
relation to the logical or fact-
ual truth or importance of the
views they express.

Now, _Mr.,

,“the‘l\/Iom-oe Doctrine is the last

thing in the world to mention to
.Latin Americans as a basis of ac-
tion.”

-_ In commenting upon U.S.—
Cuban relations, Dr. Perkins said
that "the ill-starred Bay of Pigs
Invasion of 1961 was one of those
..bluders that democracies are
sometimes prone to make. The
basic reason for the invasion’s
“failure was that “Cuban patriots
‘grossly overestimated the unrest
which the Castro regime had gen-
erated.”

‘Not ‘Ultimate Challenge’

‘Professor Perkins, while con-
ceeding the importance of the
Cuban situation, maintained that
America should not be “disposed
-to. think that this is the ultimate
" challenge in regard ‘to Russia.”
.“The problem of Cuba,” he said,
“isga secondary problem compar-
— ed to the problem of Berlin.”

, Outlining the reasons why he
-feels that communism will not
 succeed in the New World, Dr.
"Perkins stated that the Latin
*American is an “intense indivi-
llualist,” who does not have the
‘A necessary “docility” for subju-
gation. Also he feels that Latin
America states are not in them- ,
selves self-sufficient.

With President Kennedy’s sev-
en-point defense proposal in the
background, Dr. Perkins called for
the preservation of America’s in-
‘ tegrity regardless of the cost.

This is about the best thing that's happened to buying cars since
Chevrolet started building them—-four entirely different kinds of
cars to choose from at your Chevrolet dealer’: one-Stop Shopping
center. If you're a luxury-lover, you'll probably want to go no further
than those 13 plush new Jet-smooth '63 Chevrolets. Want to give your
budget an even bigger break? Step over and see what’s new with those
10 nifty models of the '63 Chevy II. Or maybe you've been eyeing
sports-car caps, in which case have a go at a sporty new '63 Corvair
(8 of them, including three snazzy bucket-seat Monzas and those big
Greenbrier Sports Wagons). There's even something for the all-out
sports-car set—the daring Corvette Sting Ray. Picking a new car has
never been easier. (Unless you'd like to own them all!)

 novel, “War of the Worlds” over

Pittsburgh Radio Network; WPGH

On October 31, 1938, Halloween

night, Wellesi presentation on the‘

‘throughout the nation. The pro-

gram began as a news bulletin in-

Listeners who had just tuned in

and missed the earlier explana-
tion that it was only fiction, be-
lieved that Martians were actual-
ly invading Princeton, New Jer-
sey.
' Intended as a Halloween treat,
“War of the Worlds” turned into a
nightmare as people called the po-
lice, claiming to have seen the
Martians, and one woman com-
mitted suicide. Sunday’s program
will be from the tapes of the
original broadcast.

  KICK BACK
Slice of life: Guard John Draksler came limping off. the

‘football ﬁeld Saturday in the third quarter. He had been a

defensive standout, knifirig down tacklers from his middle.
linebacker'position and making a nuisance of hi_mself._ UCLA’s
“Iron Man,” Kermit , Alexander,»-who is the best all-aground
back in the_ West, had kicked John inthe knee as he lay
on the ﬁeld. _ _
Draksler didn’t get back "in -the game until Pitt had‘ scor-
ed. On the ensuing kick-off, Rick:.L‘eeson booted) the ball
to the Bruin nine where Alexander picked it off and’ headed
uplﬁeld. He ran into an unopposed tankecolumn and ‘went
down faster than. Floyd Patterson. As they unpiled there

, remained one man grasping ._Alexander’s still legs —- Drak-

sler. . -

“I wanted him,” Dr'aksler'roa'red in self delight. “I want-

ed him badly and I just had-to puthim on his backquick

and hard.”

Red Badge of. Courage _ _, _
Slice of life: Jerry _Yospir_i,, a youthful-looking senior

‘ soccer player, grasped for support ashe lay‘ on an improv-
B ished stretcher across the street from the Pitt-Howard may-

hem- . . .
His right leg was contorted. His dad squeezed _his~hand
-and his mother looked on in fear. "They were in Pittsburgh
for Parents Weekend. _ ' , V _
There were ugly. ‘spike marks emblazoned on the rear
of Yos.pin’s knee, right above where his leg had suffered a
compound fracture. -They were similar to the ones that
showed red ‘on. Sam ;.Donatelli’s back. They were bloody
like the‘ gash good for 11 stiches-in Chuck Dunbar’s fore-
head. , ' ’ ‘

_ Back on the ﬁeld Paul‘ Liberati was kicking the feetout
fromunder the legs of‘theHoward team. Ted Verlato crash-
ed into a scowling- Howard manat midﬁeld. Howard soccer
players were sprawling" on the ﬁeld. _ _ i

_ In other words, the Panthers were paying theirdebts
back to a hell—bent _enemy, whose tactics required military
action. ‘ " -

When the team ﬁled * into‘ the dressing room later,-
happy with 'a‘3-l verdict, Yospin looked up, W_1nCed and
murmered,,“Nic.e going, fellows. You did a good ]Ob.

They Fought Back  , , ,

They'sur_e did do -a good" ‘job. And so .»did John Draksler.
Because they fought back. Pitt’s football tearn’made_~many
mistakes Saturday, yet they didn’t allow the Bruins to
scor‘e.-‘ They fought" back. , V. _

Every soccer player and,-every football player, and for
that matter,‘ every cross-country runner, knows whether he
‘can do the same.,Th,e mirror in -each of their rooms is the all-
knowing element. Few can kid their own staring images.

Now we have a good soccer team. They have every- .,
thing required .to reach the NCAA play-offs. And there
were about 350 people ‘who saw them beat Howard who
care about them now. The football team is equally com-
petent.'They still can go to a bowl game if they care
enough to fight for it. ' _ _ _ ,

They shouldn’t havebeen beaten by West Virginia. And
we must say here that we don’t think the team that beat

bone- from last year’s meeting and a charge which John
Kuprok made. . ' , _ _

He was wrong i-n saying it and Iwas wrongin bringing
it up again. My reasoning was to prove that such utterings
don’t win games. And I still feel that way. Studentsin Mor-
gantown, however, are no different than students here.

And any kid who goes out on a football ﬁeld and puts
out —, yet, only if he puts out — is not garbage: He’s the
same kind of kid as John Draksler and Jerry Yospin. He has
the big “G” |— not garbage, but guts.

Grove City Hosts

Panther Booters;

Hope for Reverse

Grove City entertains a much
kicked-about Panther soccer team
at 3 pm. Saturday, hoping to re-
verse ‘a 1-0‘ setback of last year.

(Editor’s Note: The results of
yesterday’s game with Slippery
Rock is not reported here because
of the Monday deadline for" to-
day’s paper.) ‘

Grove City has been winning
this year, but their competition
has not been of the same caliber
that Pitt ‘has met. The, Grovers
have slipped by Slippery Rock,
2-1, and battled them to a score-
less deadlock. St.’ Francis of L0-
retto was a 5-2 victim.

I Strong Up Front

_ The host team boasts a strong
front line,'according'to Coach Leo
Bemis. It is lead by co-captains
Carl Sorzano and Joe Levisky in
addition to freshman center for-
ward Win Mueller of Stuttgart,
Germany. ,

Mueller is reported to have a
flair for stealing the ball and
scoring on long range shots or
short head shots.

The men up front also concern
themselves with a considerable
amount of teamwork, a facet of
play which the Panthers haven’t
seen in the last few opponents.

not be complacent because of talk
about NCAA—play-off bids danc-
ing in their heads.

First in Every Meet

Larry Robinson
Leads Runners

This Season

By BOB SMIZIK

When the Panther cross-
country team hosts West Vir-
ginia Saturday its main hope
of scoring its ﬁrst win in four
years against The Mounties
will rest on the slender shoul-

ders of junior
Larry Robin-I
son.
Robinson has I
been the Pan- 
thers’ number 
one man in ev- '
ery meet this
season, includ-
ing a ﬁrst place
against Slip-
pery Rock and
he has taken I
a fourth against

 

I Robinson
Ohio University, a sixth against
Navy and a third against rival
Penn State. "-

Despite being the Panther’s
number one man, Robinson has
not lived up to Coach Carl Rees’
expectation of him.

Must Improve

“Larry will have to do some
improving it he expects to com-
pete in the IC4A championships
this year. I'm not going to take
him unless I think he will be a
worthy representative of the Uni-
versity,” said Rees.

“Larry’s biggest problem is
that he's afraid to go all out in
a race,” the coach continued.
“He seems to hold himself back
early in the race because he
feels it‘ he goes to fast he won't
have enough left to ﬁnish.

“Once Larry can lick this pro-
blem I feel that he will become
a much better runner,” Rees add-
ed.

More Desire

Rees, however, is cognizant of
the improvement Robinson has
made over last season. “He seems
to want to be better. He has more
desire this year,” he said.

In winning the Slippery Rock
meet Robinson posted the 11th
best time that has ever been
run on Pitt's 4.3 mile Schenley
Park Course. It is the third best
showing that a Pitt runner has
ever compiled. Only Ron Rush,
in 1959, and Steve Waslo, last
year, have done better than
Robinson. ’

With two more meets this year
plus another season of varsity
competition in front of him, Rob-
inson could go on to become the
fastest runner in Panther cross-
country history.

In Yogi Race;

Girls Improve

It seems as if fate was at work
this past week as the Yogi race
resulted in a four-way tie for first
place. Third place Gary Kalten-
bach (player) came up with the
best record, 12-3.

This, combined with Jim
O’Brien’s 10-5 mark and the 11-4
scores of “Sage” Smizik and
“Skip” Fleischner, caused this
unprecedented position.

“This is their last chance,"
quipped cocky Bob Smizik. “From
now on its all over. Just watch
my dust.”

“At least I'm ahead of the fe-
males,” was all O’Brien could re-
ply.

The females, however, are
showing deﬁnite improvement.
Last week Judy Engelhardt
moved within one game of .500
by compiling an 8-7 mark. This

Across the table, in the dimly-lit cocktail lounge known
as Dante’s, sat ‘a brash blonde.

To the left was Bob Drum, a gregarious 250—pound giant
who is known as the “chairman of.
the board” at Dante’s, although
there is some confusion as to the
spelling of the latter half of his
title. \ ,

Their rendezvous is a “haven

' aptly describes it in his’ book “Al-

Cussed and Discussed

The author is Bobby Layne, the
storied Pittsburgh Steeler quar-
terback who is the most cussed
and discussed player in the Na-
tional Football League. \He has
teamed up with Drum to writethe

“You sportswriters are all the

you gotta write bad. And right
now I’m good and you can't say

“Why you ever write something
bad about me and l’ll cut your
heart out,” Layne went on. “Why
you’ll be the bloodiest mess- . . .”

“Good. Good. Give it to him
good,” -roared Drum, probably the
only sportswriter in the -country
whom Layne can look at without
conjuring an image of Earl Wilson
or Dorothy Kilgallen. ' ’

“Why-you’re just another frus-
