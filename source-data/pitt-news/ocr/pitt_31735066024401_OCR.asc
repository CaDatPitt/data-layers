ProfessionalUnion   g
  Close to Confirmation

By PHILIP WINTERS

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt Professional Union has

' received 25 percent confirmation by
faculty members, to authorize them A

to act as collective bargaining agents
with the university, according to
PPU President Philip Wion.

The purpose of the drive, begun in
December, is to collect faculty sig-
natures on authorization cards mai-
led to faculty members by the PPU.
By signing the cards, faculty
members are authorizing the PPU to
represent them for collective bar-
gaining with the university.

“We need collective bargaining in
order to restructure the relationship

I between the faculty._and the univer-

sity. As it is, the administration
claims ultimate authority," said
Wion. “We are trying to change the
relationship, so that there is a legally
recognized faculty organization."

ln order to do this, the faculty
must first decide in favor of collec-
tive bargaining and choose its bar-
gaining organization in a faculty
representation election. But before
the PPU can legally petition the

MEMBER - College Nowsolpol
Business Advemsmq Mmaqol:

Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board for such an election, they
must have 30 percent authorization
by the facultv.

“We are very pleased with the suc-
cess of the card drive,” said Wion.
“Of the L350 faculty members
represented,’ we now have over 25
percent authorization, with more
cards coming in every day. Our goal
is between 50 and 60 percent, but
that isjust a target. We might decide
it would be better to start earlier, but
we probably won't petition until we

have substantially more than 30'

percent.”

Although the PPU will be work-
ing for increased salaries and better
working conditions, Wion stresses
that that is not the only area where
collective bargaining will improve
the faculty situation.

“Collective -bargaining could
strengthen and protect many of the
good things that we have. such as
academic freedom, tenure, and
faculty consultation on administra-
tive appointments," Wion said.

Wion stresses that the PPU would
be a good. organization for the
faculty to'choose.

The council also decided to defer
their consideration ofa proposal for
a certificate in Children’s Literature
and to speak to other interested par-
ties before making a decision on’ a

new major in Enviromental Studies. ,
The certificate program for Jewish .

Studiesoffers students an pppo'rtun- .
ity to concentrate l8 credits of their.
electives, in Jewish Studies while‘
pursuing an undergraduate degree"
in a different major.

According to Dean lrwin Schul-
man, dean of CAS,‘~{‘Many‘students

spend one third of their time or less,"

in their major area of study and
choose the rest of their courses at
random. The certificate programs
help the students. organize elective
courses in plausible sequence.”
The Department of Computer

Science initiated a ‘plan for new
courses and tracks. The plan,_which
the C AS council approved will serve

the students majoring in Computer

Science as well as thestudent body.
of CA5.‘ ' ‘

“The_ plan is a good step in the
direction," ' Schulman
said,“The department is figuring out
ways to make Computer Science
attractive for "majors and non-
majors as well.”

The council also approved a new
course, “Science, Philosophy and

lrrationality", which was proposed‘

by Professor Clark Glymor, Depart-
ment of History and’ Philosophy of
Science. The course will contrast
methods and procedures of various
pseudosciences with historical

methods in the natural sciences. It -

will also include material on relativ-
ity and interpretation of scientific
results. _ ,

ln other decisions, the council
elected to defer consideration of a
certificate in Children's Literature

until someone from the English 1‘
-Department is invited to a meeting.

Council Candidate Files Petition

By FREDERICK BE\ER$
Pitt News Staff Writer .
’ John Zingaro, Consumer Party
candidate for the vacant seat on
Pittsburgh City Council, filed his
petition Friday with the election
board and addressed the issues of his
campaign. ’ . 7
Speaking at a scheduled press
conference.downtown following the
filing, Zingaro brieﬂyoutlined his
platform, including: the rights.of
office workers; restoration of Pitts-
burgh’s productivity in the steel
industry; housing reform; the use-of
Pittsburgh tax dollars for military
purposes; and the need for a check

and balance on the mayor. ‘ -

He said his campaign was “not a
spurious reaction,” but was in plan-
ning since November.

\ .

The May 19 special election is for
Congressman William Coyne"s seat
and extends until January l982. Zin-
garo. said he would again run in the
November election for the full four-
year term. A ’

To appear on the ballot, Zingaro
had to collect 1500 signatures of reg-

"isteried Allegheny County voters. He

collected 2800. . -,

‘Zingaro, who describes himself as
the only alternative in the election,
said he proposes to “dovetail
Renaissance II with reform.”
Because Renaissance ll isoffered as

a solution to unemployment in the .

form of corporate offices, -Zingaro

—<said»“t»he issue is not just jobs, its

control over jobs.” ’

By MIKE LYCZKO
Pitt News Stoli Wriler

Advancement in microsurgical
techniques and specialized equip-
ment has made the reattachment of
severed fingers relatively successful
in recent years.

William M. Swartz, M.D., assist-
ant professor of surgery at Pitt’s
medical school,_ discussed digit
replantation and other reconstruc-
tive surgery at a Tuesday night lec-
ture sponsored by the University’s
Center for Emergency Medicine.

Swartz, who works in the Div-
ision of Microsurgical and Recon-
structive Surgery, said that
“microvascular surgery is a rela-
tively new area in reconstructive
surgery" and that the major goal is
to restore functional ability to the
part involved. I ,

Reattaching digits, usually the

    

fingers, requires magniﬁcation aver-
aging l6 to 40 power because tiny
blood vessels of about I millimeter
in diameter must be sewn together.
If the blood supply is not restored,

_ the replantation will not work.

Surgical microscopes, miniatur-
ized instruments, and tiny sutures
are used. A typical operation to
replant three fingers can take I6
hours.

Surgery isn't done immediately »

after the accident. The severed digits
are preserved in ice for about two
days while the operation is discussed
and the patient is prepared.

A major problem during and after
surgery is “blood clotting” in the tiny
vessels. During recovery, drugs such
as aspirin are used to combat
clotting. ‘ V I

Swartz cautioned that surgeons
.“can't replant everything." The

injury must be a clean cut, as froma
knife orslicing. machine. Digits from
a crushed hand can't be used. Also,
the “time element is important,” for

,the severed digits must be cooled

immediately and preserved.
' Even if theseconditions are met,
Swartz said that a single digit loss
s-houldn’t automatically be
replanted because a person often
does better without a finger than to
have a reattached finger “comprom-
ise" the use of.the other ﬁngers. _
He said “the ‘ thumb is
irreplaceable-—every effort should be
made to replant a thumb. If this
can’t be done, the surgeon should try

to reconstruct a thumb by using a

toe.”

Priority for surgery is givenzto
patients who need the fingers in a
career, such as a musician or athlete.
Surgery is also done for cosmetic

  
  

reasons if the injury is particularly
unsightly.
~Th§f,unctional recovery for digit

and hand replantations is much bet— ,
' _ter than for limb replantations

(which don’t require magnification).
ln_arm or leg replants, nerve regen-
eration is often so slow that muscles
deteriorate. . ' ~ ,

if a person is ever involved in an
accident_ where a body .part is

severed, Dr. Swartz said that the .

part should be put in a plastic bag in

ice-but not directly in ice or water. '-

Dry ice should no-t be used. ln addi-
tion to digits and limbs, ea-rlobes and
scalps can possibly be reattached.

The person should then come to I

Presbyterian University Hospital
for possible replantation, Swartz
said. . ' -
The percentage of recovery varies
according to age. A A ’

“The younger the patient, the bet—
ter off they’ll be,”' Swartz said.
Children under- I5 have a much
greater capacity at nerve regenera-
tion and generally do well with
reconstructive surgery. -

Swartz also discussed other uses
of reconstructive microsurgery,

‘where “flaps" of muscle: along with
their blood supply are transplanted
from one part ofthe body_to another
to" cover a severe open wound.

Amputation due to gangrene (from 1

loss of blood s‘upply),alnd ‘infection
canoften be prevented this way. .
Various organs, such as the eso-

phagus and larynx, can be recon- ‘

structed with microsurgery. '

The first successful limb replanta-
tion was that of an arm in Boston in
1962. The first “free human digital

O replantation" was done in l968.

Philosophy Department 0 ersNe ro

By LARRY LEDERER
Pill News Sloll Writer
In accordance with Pitt's philo-

Qsophy department, a new introduc-

‘*4.

tory course called “Case Studies in
How Philosophers Work” will be
offered starting next fall term.

Dr. Richard Gale, the founding
father of the course, describes it as
being, “a sort of all-star introduc-
tory philosophy course based on the
strength of the philosophy depart-
ment.” Indeed, the philosophy
department at Pitt is nationally
acclaimed. It has been in the top ten
since I964, and is currently ranked
third behind Harvard and Prin-
ceton, respectively. p

“The new introductory course is
designed to be a stepping stone into
the I00’s and increase undergradu-
ate 'philosophy enrollment," Dr.
Gale said. “In fact, any eligible
undergraduate is encouraged to take
it because it will aid students argu-
mentative and interpretative skills.
A very broad range of interests
would be applicable for taking this
course."

Students will read through a per-
ennial philosophical problem such
as whether the existence ofGod can
be proven or disproven, then
observe how one of Pitt’s faculty
members handles it.

Six of Pitt’s faculty members will
guest lecture at thecourse throught-
out the term, each on a single issue.
They will take the issue at hand in
relation to their own specialties in
philosophy. Then, Gale’s task will be

The Pitt News, Monday, March 2, 1981

to integrate what the guest lecturer
has said, the asigned readings, and
some of his own views to arrive at
some sort ofan understanding ofthe
problem. Thus, students may inter-
pret the problem in their own way by
using these paradigms as guides.
The six members of the philo-
sophy department who will guest
lecture are: Professors Kurt Baler,
David Gauthier, Adolf Grunbaum,
Carl Hempel, Nicholas Rescher, and

Wilfrid Sellars. All have published‘

articles and books covering many
aspects of philosophy.

Gale emphasizes that throughout
the course, students will not be
expected (nor will they want) to
arrive at “answers,” but, they will be
expected to arrive at strong theories
that are supported extensively.

For example, one can not
“answer” a question about the limits
and scope of human knowledge, yet,
one can present strong arguments as
to their beliefs about the material.
That is, it will be up to the students
to arrive at their own interpretation

of the topic. Like observing a paint- '

ing, many different interpretations
can be made.

After the students get a feeling as
to how some of Pitt’s philosophers

handle particular problems in differ- ‘

ent areas of philosophy, they will be
required to prepare a take-home
mid-term, a final examination, and
perhaps one short paper, according
to Gale. Also, effective class partici-
pation would contribute immensely

‘ to the understanding ofthe problem.

Pitt’s philosophers are said to be S0m€ Ofthe best in the country.

He called the idea that the money
the defense department spends in a
particular area is being used to
create jobs, a “fallacy.”

He said the money is used for
equipment, not jobs. _ l i _
Zingaro said he would try to

,“spark a movement to transfer

money” out ofthe military budget,
back into the cities, the schools and
transit systems, though he didn’t
give any specifics of such a progam.

Finally, he called for a “check and
balance on the mayor, independant
of the Democratic Party.”

He said “if it’s the Democratic
Party I get my support from, it’s the
Democratic Party I’ll lookout for. If
it’s issues I win on, it’s issues l’Il act

‘on.
‘ “Pittsburghers have a clear cho-

ice,” Zingaro said. “They can vote

for a candidate who is getting sup-

port-only because he, belongs to a

party that is offering jobs and street

money, or they can vote fora candi-
da-te who is getting ‘support not
because of hisname, not because of

abilityto hand outjobs, but because
of the issues and ideas his campaign.

what scientists term ”superconj_unc-
tion.”

’’I really think of this alignment as

a rather poor straight line,” said Dr. '

George Gatewood, director of the
Allegheny Observatory. ”lt’s not
what I would call a straight line.”
But whatever its exact dimen-
sions, there has been a great deal of

controversy over the effect of such

an alignment on the planet Earth.

The authors of the book The Jup- V

iter.Eﬂect, John R. Gribbin and Ste-
phen Plagemann, predict that "there
will be many earthquakes, large and
small, around susceptible regions of

. the globe. One region, where one of .

the greatest fault systems lies today
under great strain, long overdue for

a giant leap forward andjust waiting -

the necessary kick, is California. _
The alignment due in I982
happens once every 179 years. The
last time it occurred (I803), Califor-
nia underwent a period of concen-
trated earthquake activity. ,
”California' could have many
earthquakes in the next few years,
but we don‘t know where or when,"
said Walter Pilant, associate profes-

’ sor of Geophysics at Pitt- ’’But, I find

the whole idea of predicting earth-

quakes by rare conjunctions, such as 1

the one in I982, I00 percent invalid."

Other significant alignments
occur much more often. Jupiter and
Saturn align every 30 years; Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune every
I85 years. And the closer planets,
Venus and Mercury, are aligned
quite often. : otten. ' '

"We have similar alignments
every 30 years and better ones every
I85,” said Gatewood. A i

”The alignment of I803 wiasjrust a

coincidence," he added. ”I don’t A

know of a single scientist who is of

— the same opinion as the authors of

Jupiter Effect. _

’’In other words,” Gatewood con-
tinued, ”it takes place so frequently
that if there was any corrolation,
we’d have all sorts of ways to predict
and pay attention to possible
earthquakes. I I

"It uses astrology as its basis and I
don't believe it,” he said.

Both Gatewood and Pilant did
agree that the sun, moon, and
planets close to the Earth, do have
an effect upon certain behaviors.

"The moon, as we know, affects
‘the tide and raises the crust of the
Earth a full 12 inches,” Gatewood
said. ”However, I don’t believein the
idea that the moon affects the brain
as in lunacy.

"Jupiter is 2000 times as far away

‘ as the moon is,” said Gatewood,

”and our sensitive instruments can’t
detect the effects of these planets so
far away. The “additional gravita-
tional iiyullvaccbmpanying this align-
ment in I982 will only be two parts
in 2,000,000,000 more.”

”Sun_spot activity," explained
Pilant, -"affects our radio reception,

and the more activity the worse the "

reception. This activity occurs when
a charged particle from the sun

3 arrives into the ionosphere, which is

what the radio waves~use.

"The whole idea of earthquake
prediction using the observations of '

petuated by those who_ believe in
astrology, something I feelhas’ no
validity."

Seismic gaps are quiet’ zones in an

' area that has had large earthquakes A

Identifying such a gap does not gua- .

does indicate where a large earth-

  Defining
Feminism

The Oxford American Dictionary definesa feminist
as “a supporter of women's claims to be given rights,
opportunities and treatment equal to those of men.”
While this seems to be a rather clear cut ideology for
members of the movement, the definition hardly goes
far enough to categorize the varied postulates it
contains. '

less than generous. But rather than
burden you with such obviously
scurrilous claptrap, 1 will set my
tone only by offering a couple of
accounts from “insiders.” Take for
example, Rene Descartes and Tho-

would have to appear on anybody’s
list of the top twenty who ever lived.
These two men disagreed with each
other on just about every matter of

Gloria Steinem’s recent lecture at Pitt brings to light
': some of the problems. Although the feminist move-
ment is making progress, there is something hamper-'

Letters

, .

ing the effectiveness of their efforts and the
achievements of their goals. This seems to be the
dichotomy between the feminist movement and the
feminist philosophy.

, It is at this point that feminism becomes diluted and
disjointed. Although Steinem doesn’t view herself as
the “ﬁgurehead of the feminist movement,” this unof-.
ficial position is one of the few cohesive points to the
crusade.

Approximately, Steinem labels the movement as
one of individuals. It seems, however, that because of
this, many “feminists" are specifying their own goals
and ignoring the movement as a whole. '

'l" he way this male-dominated society is structured,
it would seem that a feminist’s indiviual structuring
becomes more of a philosophy, rather than part of a
progressive movement. It would also seem that to
make any headway in the push for equal rights, the
feminists must, for a time, band together a bit more
tightly to really get the ball rolling. L

Without this common bond—-one of principles and
objectives stated cleary in black and white—the femi-
nist movement ceases to become a movement alto-
gether. The feminists become _leaderless guerrillas
simply impeding the obstruction of their rights, rather
than setting any kind of precedent.

This would make the “rights, opportunities and
treatment equal to those of men," a very far-sighted
goal. More unity is imperative, for,their common"
enemy is not an opposing movement;“they are battling
generations ofsocial brainwashing that, even when
recognized as unfair, is difficult to dissolve. They are
fighting something that, to many, is a way of life.

Grossly unjust and frightening as this is, it is some-
thing that women striving for those elusive equal rights
must recognize and prepare to fight. Although they are
individuals and should never lose sight of that, they
must search for and strike a single conjunctive chord.
From this point, the individual woman can work to
modify her life in relation to the much needed justice
done to her sex. . L '

A '50 What?’ Reaction to jPosvarStory   

Dear Editors: I .

After reading twice the sensation-
alized three page account of Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar’s acting as a
"personal intermediary” between the
CIA and a selected group of univer-
sity presidents, my initial reaction
remains: so what?

You billed this article as a_news
breaking story, but I failed to find
one. There’s nothing new, unusual,
or illegal about a chancellor of a
university being contacted -by a
Director of the CIA. If the point of
the story was to reveal CIA inﬁltra-
tion on campus-as was customary
for the CIA to do during -the_ 60’s‘
demonstrations-then l’m afraid you
missed the mark. You failed to cite
specific examples of who-and why
the CIA was investigating and then
you failedto link Posvar’s ‘involve-
ment in such an activity, if indeed a
connection exists. A _ .

Philosophy

the same top twenty, Bertrand Rus-
sell maintained that philosophy is

the business of finding premises
which nobody could deny, and steps
which nobody could dispute, such
that together they yield conclusions
which no sane person would believe.
Now these three men (and their des-
criptions are not atypical) are
among the experts of the experts.
We could hardly accuse them of
being ignorant about philosophy, or
of being prejudiced against it. So

" what l want to do here is offera view

of philosophy-l call it the “leftover
garbage" view-which l think does
justice to the insights of these great
masters. l will, of course, spell the
view out in somewhat fuller detail,
not only to enlighten the reader, but
also in the hope of answering that
question which must be on the tip of
every tongue: if philosophy is all
absurdity and garbage, why does
anyone do it‘? And by that circuitous
route, l propose to get back, eventu-
ally, to relevance.

Before beginning proper, how-
ever, it is only decent to warn that
this “garbage view” is my own. Some
of my colleagues might agree with it;
but l "suspect that many would be
happier with rather different
accounts-not that they would agree

with each other, ofcourse. ln partic-
ular, it‘s fairly clear from the pub-
lished works of Hobbes, Descartes,
or Russel that none of them would
accept the view l‘m going tonpresent.
But then all kinds of absurd views
are to be found in philosophers‘
£\;vbr(i)tli1rtigsS,[;sltl) that‘s nothing to worry
- , there lS a lesson to be

learned here: philosophy is unique
among established intellectual
endeavors to have as one of its own
problems what it itself is. Physicists
or literary critics may from time to
time try to say in their own words
what physics or literary criticism is,
but this is no more part oftheirdisci—
pline per se than it would be for a
physicist to say what criticism is, ora
critic to say what physics is. The

proper domain of physics is physical
nature; of literary criticism, litera-
ture. lfwe ask whose business it is to
say what these disciplines them-
selves are, the only available answer
is: it’s the philosophers’ business.

When the physicists and critics turn .

to such issues, we say they are “wax-
ing philosophical.” ‘

So this adds another dimension to
our problem. Not only must we
explain why philosophy is garbage,
and why if it’s garbage it’s worth
doing, but we must also explain

ENERAL

why, after the physicists have sone
their physics, the critics their criti-
cism, and so on, the philosophers are
left holding the bag-- namely the
bag of questions about what eve-
rybody (including the philosophers
themselves) was doing. This new
twist to the issue. luckily, provides
a clue to our overall task. To
characterize philosophy is, in part,
to distinguish it from such things
as the sciences, technology, the
;arts, and other humanistic studies;
"and part of this distinction lies in
the phrase: “is left holding the
bag.”

Let me follow up fora moment on
the matter of seperating philosophy
from other pursuits. First we can
draw a broad and not too sharp line
between the arts and what might be
called “intellectual” undertakings.
Now this calls for two qualifications
right away. One is that “art” should
be understood in a wide sense—not
just fine arts but also manual arts,
industrial arts, arts and crafts, and
so on. In general, arts are those skills
and activities that are directed
towards making things (tangible or
otherwise sensible things). So in this
wide sense, technology, too, will fall
among the arts, as will invention,
architecture and cooking. The

    NERAL DYNAMIC:

second qualification is that “intellec-
tual" should be taken narrowly. In
particular, I don’t want to slight the
arts by this contrast with the
intellectual-as if artistry did not
involve intelligence, or some such.
By “intellectual undertakings" l
mean only those which are directed
primarily toward acquiring new gen-
eral understanding or knowledge of
things. Basically this includes what
most people would mean by “theo-
retical" or “pure" research, as
opposed to “practical” or “applied”
efforts (though these terms are just
as loaded as the ones I have used
alread_y). In the intellectual group,
now suitably narrowed down, will
fall the recognized sciences, philoso-
phy, and perhaps a few other things
like historiography, mathematics,
and philology. I repeat that my dis-
tinction is not a hard and fast one,
and that it does not rule intelligence
out of art-nor artistry out of science
and philosophy.

The importance of the distinction
is that it reduces the problem of
characterizing philosophy. Now we
need only show how it differs from
other “intellectual” undertakings-
mainly, sciences. lf we look at this
question historically, we make a
rather surprising discovery: most of

the sciences were not distinguished
from philosophy until compara-
tively recently. Newton’s ‘major
work on mechanics and gravitation,
fro example, was entitled:
“Mathematical Principles of Natu-
ral Philosophy," and Newton was
well into what we call “the modern
era.“ Closer to home,_ it wasn't until
l9l5 that there was a separate psy-
chology department here at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. Before that, it
was part of philosophy. Such
,branching off from philosophy is
typical of a great many fields that
now count as sciences. Indeed, it is
no accident that the highest acade-
mic degree olleredin most intellect-
tual disciplines is called not just a
doctorate, but a doctor of
philosophy-a Ph.D.

Panthers Lose At Buzzer;

By'MlKE DICHIARA

Pitt News Sports Writer

It began as a repeat of this past
Jan. 10. On that date, the Rutgers
Scarlet Knights got off to a quick
lead against the Pitt Panthers at the

. Field House, holding a 10-point

advantage throughout most of the
game. '

On Saturday, Rutgers ( 16-13) was
able to get an early 10 point lead
against the Panthers, but Pitt (15-
ll) ,managed to keep pace in the
second half before losing to Rutgers
in Piscataway, NJ. 61-60, as a last
second shot by Dwayne Wallace
went in and out of the basket.

With 3:38 left to play in the game,
Roy Hinson converted on a three
point play to give Rutgers the lead,
59-58. Pitt called a time out to plan
strategy, and Rutgers came out in
the four-corner offense. Hinson was
trapped by Lennie McMillian to
force a jump ball and the tip was
won by Pitt. Wallace drove the lane
and scored with 24 seconds left to

give Pitt a 60-59 advantage.

After a Rutgers timeout, Hinson
hit an 1 l-foor, turnaroundjumper in
the lane and Rutgers led 61-60 with
six seconds left. Pitt called another
timeout and Clyde Vaughn was put
in, presumably to take the final shot.
But the ball was inbourided to Wal-
lace, who brought the ball to the

’forecourt and shot a 13-footer that
went in, rolled around the iron and
popped out as the buzzer sounded.

The contest was characterized by
physical play under the baskets.
While the first half was relatively
foul—free-—neither team was in the
bonus situati‘on—the second half
turned into a free-for-all as the offi-
cials slapped each team with numer-
ous fouls.

With the Panthers leading 6-5
after three minutes of play in the
game, the Scarlet Knights began a
streak in which they scored ‘seven

Pantherettes Lose;

By MARIE HUFF

Pitt News Sports Writer

The Pantherettes ended regular
season play on asour note Saturday
night, losing to the Lady Knights of
Rutgers, 87-73. Pitt, whose record
is now 20~6, must wait for the East-
ern Seedings Committee to meet and
rank the top eight teams in the
region. The results of this meeting

will determine who the Pantherettes .

will face in the first round of the
playoffs.

Poor shooting on the part of,the
Pantherettes in the first half was the
determining factor of the game.

1 Rutgers moved to a convincing‘23—
6 lead in nine minutes, led by Kris
Kirchener who dumped in nine
points. At the 10:43 mark, Lori
Dolby hit a free throw, marking the
beginning of a Pantherette
comeback.‘ i

Pitt’s offense came alive, sparked
by Debbie Lewis and Pam Miklase-

, vich. The paircombined for 13 ofthe

16 points scored in a drive that
brought the Pantherettes within
nine, 3 l——22, with 4:26 remaining in
the first half. However, the surge fell
short, and Rutgers held a 36-24
edge at halftime. '
‘In the first 20 minutes of play, the

Pantherettes shot a meager 29 per- -,

cent, hitting only nine fieldgoals the
entire first half. The Lady Knights
earned their lead by sinking .17 shots

fromthe floor, which translates into’ _

,2 hot 53 percent. _ ' .-

straight points to take command 12-
6. The Knights were led with baskets
from Hinson, Clarence Tillman and
Rich Brunson. Tillman and Hinson
ﬁnished as Rutgers’ leading scorers
with 18 and 16 points respectively.‘

After a Pitt timeout, Rutgers was
able to score two mdre baskets and
take a 16-6 lead.

At this point, visions of the first

imeeting between these twoiteams

were evident. Pitt was not shooting
well, as was the problemiduring the
first game, and ended the first half
hitting only 14 of 44 shots from the
field for a 31.8 percentage. Rutgers,
meanwhile, netted 50 percent of its
first half shots.

As time wore down in the half, the
Panthers started a comeback with
about three minutes remaining.
Rutgers led 32-22 when consecutive
baskets by Sam Clancy, McMillian
and Carlton Neverson brought Pitt
within two, 32-30, with a minute left.
Following a Rutgers basket, Never-
son missed a chance to score with
three seconds ledt and Rutgers’s lead
was down to four at the intermis-
sion, 34-30.

Pitt's problems were legion during
that half of play. Wallace, who had
been carrying a large scoring burden
the past few games, shot only 1 for

10 from the field. Clancy, hampered
by an ankle injury, shot only 3 for 9.
And as a team, Pitt was out
rebounded, 17‘-9.

On the other side, Rutgers-main
weapon, Kelvin Troy, was limited to
two points in the half, six in the
game. Tillman led the Knightsiwith
10 first-half points. '

' The second half was physical.
Clancy got in foul trouble with four
personals, Ed Scheuermann fouled
out, and Wallace and Neverson
played most of the remaining with
three fouls each. Hinson and Troy
had four and three fouls respectively
for Rutgers. As a r"e’sult of the ons-

laught of fouls, bot_h teams were in Dwayne Wallace couIdn’t silik

Tough Road
For Pzlt

By MIKE DICHIARA

Pitt News Sports Writer
P1tt’s basketball team haslost to

Rutgers twice this season. In fact,
the Panthers haven’t beaten Rutgers
since 1973. The team hopes to end
that losing streak when they face
Rutgers tomorrow at the Fitzgerald
Field House at 8 p.m. in the opening
round of the Eastern Eight
tournament. , .. .
These two teams know each other
very well. They met last Saturday
and played a physical gamethat was
fought mainly '8 underneath the
basket. Rutgers’ main strength is in
the front line, where they start Kel-
vin Troy, Clarence Tillman and Roy
Hinson. In Saturday’s game, Til-
lman and Hinson ‘were’ the team’s
leading scorers with 18 and l6'points
respectively. ‘ V - '_
“We have to slow them down into
their offense,” said Panther coach
Roy Chipman. “They have more

vtrouble that way. We also have to '

rebound the ball more.” _
In addition to controlling the Sca-

‘ rlet Knight’s frontiline, the Panthers

will rieed consistent production
from the guard position. Over the
past several games, Pitt’s Dwayne
Wallace and Carlton Neverson have
been catalysts. When the two guards
were ‘both shooting well, Pitt has
come away with a victory. i
This past Saturday, however,
Wallace started'poorly,.hitting only

\ one of 10 shots from the field in the‘

first half. When he improved in the

second half, Pitt made a,_g‘arne of it.

right down to the buzzer.
Neverson. is another key. He
scored 25 points against Rutgers
' Saturday and was the main reason
Pitt stayed close right down to the
end. . g '
The Panther that will also have to
be heard frorn"is -Sam Clancy.
Clancy" was_ severely limited in
1 Saturdga-y’s game with a bad ankle
and finished. withonly 10 points. I

Clancy is the man that Pitt "will need 1 '

healthy to battle the boards against
-Tillman, Troy and Hinson.

i Shirk Leads Gymnasts

By JEFF DUROSKO

Pitt gymnast Lisa Shirk led the way
Saturday as the Pantherettes
dumped arch-rival West Virginia
l38.8-129.35.

Shirk, ranked third in the nation,
wonsall four events and the all-
around to pace the No. 2 team in the
east to a surprisingly easy victory
over the third-ranked Lady
Mountaineers.

ln the event, the vault, Shirk
scored a 9.4 in winning the event,
while Pitt's Holly Martino and
WVU’s Danis Sill tied for second

place with 9.0’s. Pantherette Regina’

Carson was third with an 8.75.

Shirk repeated ‘her 9.4 in the
second event, the uneven bars in
copping top honors. WVU’s Donna
Donati was seond with an 8.7 while‘
Pitt’s Bonnie Tressler was third with
an 8.55._

In the third ‘event, the balance
beam, Shirk had an’ 8.9, outscoring
Carson who was second with an 8.5

and Donati who was third with an.

the day, a 9.5, easily outdistancing
Martino, who had an 8.65 and Pan-
therette Karen Martin (8.55).

In the all-around, Shirk won with
a 37.2, Carson was second with a
33.6 and Donati was_third with a
33.2. .

“We had good vaulting and floor
exercises,” said Pitt caoch Donna
Sanft. “We had a few breaks though
on the bars and beam. But, when we
did have a break, the kids got killed
scorewise. On routines that should
have scored 8.4’s and 8.5’s, the girls
were only getting 8.0’s.” ‘

According to Sanft, the Pitt squad
is trying something new this season

-in bringing injudges from outside of

the area. .

“On one occasion it helped. VWe
brought in an internationally quali-
fied judge and she scored us higher
than any of the locals,” said Sanft,
“but not Saturday as agNew" Jersey
judge, who was used "to judging
small colleges, though she was ‘giv-
ing out a phenomenal score by giv-

.ing a 9.0. Personally, I was very

disappointed with the scoring. l feel
we should have been at l40 or more
and because of our trying to qualify
for nationals, every little bit helps.”

‘They could care less whether we

With Neverson picking up some
of the slack—he ended as the
games‘s high scorer with 25 points-
and Wallace regaining his recent

shooting form, ending with l3
points, Pitt took its first lead since
early in the game, 41-40 with I3 min-

From here, the game was a seesaw
battle right down to the final buzzer.
With Neverson and Wallace provid-

to outshoot Rutgers in the second
half, the Scarlet Knights stayed in
the game "by shooting foul shots
effectively. With the bonus situation

Swimmers Favored To Capture Eastern Crown

By SEAN BARN ES

Pill News Sports Writer

Nineteen of Pitt’s best women
swimmers and divers will com-
pete against 20 of the top teams
in the East for the Eastern cham-
pionship title at Trees Pool this
Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
The Pantherettes are this sea-
son’s favorite to win Easterns,
with the Princeton Tigers close
behind. Pitt defeated Princeton
88~43 during the regular sea-
son. but Princeton is last year’s
Eastern champion and will be
out to defend its title.

The Pantherettes (9-- I) have
one remaining regular season
meet before Easterns. Tomorrow
at 4 p.m. Carnegie—MeIIon will
come.to Trees Pool for the last
meet in which a team can qualify
for Easterns. Coach Dick Brad-
shaw has guided the Pantherettes
an excellent season, with the
team’s only loss coming early in
the season to North Carolina
State. Otherwise, ‘the Pan-
therettes have demolished every
opponent by almost embarrass-
ing scores for the other team.
These impressive wins have given
Pitt top seeding in every event,
including diving.

The divers, under head coach
Julian Krug, recently had
nationals pre-qualification at
Penn State. Pitt‘s Julie DeHaven
will be going to Nationals for
both one- and three-meter div-
ing. Freshman Lisa Huey placed

, I3th out of6I divers on the one- I

meter board‘ and will be first

I Nowci

The Pantherette swimmers ‘hope to plunge pastthe opposition, led by reigning champ Princeton,
as Pitt hosts the EAIAW regional championships this weekend at Trees Pool.

I alternate since only the top 12

finishers qualify nationally. Pitt
divers should do well in Easterns
since only half of the teams that
went to national prequalifica-
tions will be at Trees Thursday.

Harvard, Princeton and Penn .

State will be the closest competi-
tion in the diving.

The swimming portion of
Easterns should also be domina-
ted by Pitt. The woman are
ranked 12th in the nation and
will probably move up to No.9 or
better with the strength they have

. attained this season.

The freestyle event should be
ruled by Pitt's Jan Ujevich, Amy
Jackson, and Denise Sedlacek.
Ujevich is seeded first in the 50-
and I00-yard events. Sue Heon is
the best bet among Pitt's long
distance freestylers to win her
events. Heon is currently fourth
in the nation in the I650-yard
freestyle. She is also seeded
highly in the backstroke events,
as is Pantherette Bonnie Durdy.

Ujevich, Firth and Suzanne
Pulley are seeded first, second
and fourth respectively in the

-Out of the I7 individual events

I at Easterns, each swimmer can

“only” swim five individual
events plus two relays. Coach
Bradshaw can enter the women
in quite an a-rray of-events with
swimmers like Ujevich, who
qualified for ll individual events
and all five relays. All 15 Pitt
swimmers qualified in the relays,
and I I ofthe I5 qualiﬁed in more
individual events than they will
, be allowed to swim at Easterns.
The Pantherettes have already
qualified nationally in IS events.
They have not yet shaved prac-
tice distances this season and
don’t intend to until the end of
March, when Nationals will be
held. Some Eastern teams have
already shaved and almost all
will --except Pitt-- for Easterns.

Pitt looks to move up nation-
ally not only this year but also
next year. Leaving after this sea-
son will be seniors Durdy and
Pulley. Although both women
will be _a big loss to the team,
recruiting looks excellent for
Bradshaw. And, with freshmen
like Heon, nationally ranked in
two individual events and three
relays, Pitt doesn’t expect any-
thing but improvement next
year. '

“We have links with other labor
movements,“ he said, “such as the
AFL-CIO and the American Feder-
ation of Teachers. Instead ofjust the
faculty. we have the aid ofa broade_r
political spectrum. This includes
affective lobbying and contacts in
legislature.“

In addition, the PPU is trying to
work closer with the American
Association of Universi_ty Profes-
sors, and has proposed forming a
coalition with them to be called the
United Faculty of the University of
Pittsburgh. _ _, -

“In I976,” said Wion. “there were
three different organizations com-
peting for the representation of Pitt
faculty. We are trying to avoid dif-
ferent faculty groups running
against each other now."

The AAUP has asked for a one
year delay on their decision concern-
ing the coalition, with an option to

“We hope to form the coalition
before the year is up," said Wion.
“We would like to unite to see the

To the Editor: —

I have some comments concerning "American Film/Industry Sinking
Amid Problem'Crisis”:

1. What is a "Problem Crisis"? A financial crisis would be a situation in
which problems exist concerning finances. Would a problem crisis be a
situation in which problems exist concerning problems?

2. "Being a director used to be a revered profession.” This is missing the
point. Directors were never revered for losing money or making bad
movies. The key issue is that today's directors are consideredvto be respon-
sible for their movies, good or bad. Under the old studio system, directors
were technicians working on other people's movies. Can you name the four
directors of "The Wizard of Oz"? How many people can tell you who
_directed "Gone With the Wind"?

3. What does "average budgets have soared to anywhere between "$10
million and $40 million per picture" mean? The word 'average' does not
belong in this sentence. Maybe, you meant 'typical'?

»4. What does "rhetoric/ally discussing” mean? I would be anxious to hear
a non-rhetorical discussion. _ . E

5. What does "are hired and fired’ in alarming frequency” mean? Is

alarming frequency a room where the director of personnel sits? Shouldn't .

the phrase be -"with alarming frequency"?

6. Isn't "the main core of the company" a bit redundant?

7. What does "thus escalating the total amount that must return in pure
profit in order to make the picture financially successful" mean? ls "pure
profit” money used to payoff interest rates? Is it less than "net profit”?

8. "Producing a blockbuster is still a hit or miss situation. One can only
hope that the industry will aim with eyes opened instead of closed, thus
hitting the target more often than not." One hopes that most movies will be

blockbusters? Do you own stock in movies companies? I would lil<e.to see
the industry remain financially viable and occasionally produce a quality
movie. If blockbusters are necessary for this to occur, I'll leave it to you to sit
through "Star Wars" five or six times. ‘ -
Robert Desno

Granted, everyone has his opinions, but in the SHOWCASE review of
Altered States (February, 17,1981), 1 am convinced that Mr. Kleinke has few
that can be backed up by logical‘ thought. _ -

From the headline to the final paragraph, he seems to be misled, swallow-
ing the superficial aspects of the film, misinterpreting them, and then
trying to come to some conclusions. "Misplaced Scientist Deflates Potential
Thriller," reads the headline; The movie is not aythriller, first of allisure, it is
a potential thriller——but, if it were, then the meaning of the film would
become lost in the "Oohs and aahs” of the audience, subordinating sensi-
tive, heart—felt response to gut-response. . '

The story does not deal with genetic experiments as, Mr.~Kleinke would JV

call it, its "theme.” A theme is a little more abstract, dealing with aspects of
the human condition. If he had reviewed Star Wars, I am convinced he
would believe it's theme was space travel. Hogwash. Theme lies under-

neath; one must think, using the process of combining the whole of the film ‘

to determine its final effect, whether it be simpleor complex. Suppose I
suggest the theme is the nature of modern man himself. Granted, this is
vague, but see: the film in every way supportsthe theory that the evolution
of the "new brain" creates the human emotion of love, and the capability to
surmount the instinctional or the irrational with conscious thought. This is

supported by Jessup acting, as “Kleinke puts it, "like a madman.” This is A
supported by the subplot of love, and by the ending of the film itself, where, _

after the irrational has been investigated, Jes.su‘p must learn to control it-—
the epitome of the egovovercome by the epitome of the superego, as it were.

Jessup recognizes the dangerousness of his experimentation, but he,is
drawn into it irrationally. (Compare this with ’’Heart of Darkness" or the \

novel Edgar Huntley.) / ‘

The Art of Gesture is one
of the most ancient, most
difficult-and rarestart of the
performing media. It is for
that reason that the greatest .

Marceau, has reaped the most

,, passionate world-wide praise

ever bestowed on a silent
performer. The London Times.

I would almost certainly be the

first addition to the national

coffer.” The Chicago Sun-Times

sang, ”He is simply .

ever happened to silence.”

French critic Francois Cha-
lais raved, "His silence speaks
all languages. Do we recognize
the privilege that is ours to be

.a contemporary of such a

person?” I also remem-ber my

SPECIAL EVENTS
  Deflation: Marceau_Lost On Heinz Stage  

tery of symbol and emotion.

So, anticipating a vivid and
electric evening with the
world's greatest mime artist,
one attends the Friday night
performance at Heinz Hall and
can't help but emerge (dare I

V say it) dissatisfied and disap-

I pointed. Before some fervent_
theatre-goer dis-misses this
reviewer as being unapprecia-
tive. of the finer, ”pure" cultu—\’
ral events, I must confess that
the disappointment lies not in
Marceau’s actual performance,
‘but in the stage environment.

Heinz Hall is~a theatre built’
to accomodate large, major
shows: ‘symphonies, ballets
and the like.‘ Marceau’s perfor-
mance is also a major produc-
tion, but a one-man
pantomime show is a unique
and difficult event to stage
effectively for larger audiepn-.
ces. The very natureof pan-
tomime requires different,
rules and settings for a truly_
visceral performance. Since - '
there was_ only a sole per-
former on a baresfage, minus
dialogue or continuous music
or sound effects, the silenceof
the empty, cavernous stage
and Marceau’s performance
was deafening.

”But my dear,” berates a
phantom drama. society club
member, ’_’you ‘miss the whole
point of mime. Marceau him-
self fills the stag_e. His move-

' ments express the little
dramas and human emotions
that we can all relate to. Mime
is pure and speaks for itself.”

' Mimevis indeed-regarded as
a valuable, ”pure” art form
because it requires mor.e con-

audience to interpret expres-

v sions and symbols. But any

iPolanski Pays Tribute To Thomas Hardy With ‘Tess’

 J TESS

Directed by Roman Polanski
' Based on the novel by
Thomas Hardy
By THOM PALMER

How much justice is done in the

' 7 cinema in the last few years is .a mat-
- — ter of debatable opinion. Tess may be

- construed as an assault on this jus-

tice, or injustice. While the film is not
ﬂawless in its three sprawling hours,
'it is a beautiful achievement for
\ Polanski, and an epic representation
and tribute to Thomas Hardy.

-, Polanski shows such artistic res-
traint in translating the novel to the
screen that it makes one wonder if
Polanski found some way of using
Hardy as a creative consultant on the
film. The detail of Tess contributes
not so much to its sporadic drama, as
“ it-does to development of the film as a
whole. Admittedly, while some
moments are morestriking than oth-
ers,‘the narrative progression com-
plements high points rather than
abandons them. With the material

that Polanski had as a basis for the I

. work, much of the film could have
presented itself as extraneous to the
viewer, while still seeming to func-

.» tion purposefully for the diretor.

But the skill that Polanski shows in
Tess avoids anything extraneous. The
mysticism of the Hardy" style still
exists, but not to the point where
Polanski would tend to seem indul-
gent. He cuts the corners that need to
be. cut, and eliminates that which
would hardly be transferable to the

- ,, screen, or that which would only

serve as very weak links of transition.

’ Tess (Nastassia Kinski) goes to the
D’Urberville estate in a neighboring
area, on behalf of her family, who feel
‘that they descend from a long lineof
the clan. The D'Urbervilles that she
encounters are not really D’Uber—
villes at all, but the rich son uses his
affluence to acquire the services of
Tess and eventually take advantage

of her.

To this point in the film, Polanski
builds very slowly. This seems, in
part, due his attention to character

and environment. He takes pains to ‘
familiarize us with the story's setting I

Also, we are not thrust into Tess’
world with the hope that her feelings
will eventually become crystal clear
to us. At the ‘start, we simply meet
her, and the film follows almost as if
prides and prejudices become more

" complex as our interpretations of

these become more lucid. -
Through this gentle and beautiful
construction, Tess might even.be con-

sidered as Polanski’s lesson in-reading_ ’

the gestation of a film correctly con-
ceived and executed. .
For instance, Tess’ actions» and

. reactions in the early moments of the
' film are none that impede the pro-

\

 

’...Tess might even be .considered. as
Polanski's lesson in reading the gestation j
of a film correctly conceived and

executed.’

and people; their habits, feelings and
most importantly, the characters’
development and language. Being too
judicious in containing the scope of
the story would detract from under-
standing or sympathizing with it. As
earlier stated, Polanski pays attention
to the details that make Tess a fitting

film version of Tess of the D'Urbervilles. , ’
» He doesn't throw the language of the

book at us and expect us to accept it or
overlook it. More appropriately, we
are weaned into it, almost unaware,

until it becomes established, under- ~
. stood and welcomed as the tone the

film will, and must take. ‘ «

gress of the film. Polanski doesjnot
leave us behind pondering what one
of -Kinski’s pouty, languid looks

means while the narrativce gallops‘

along’at its own pace. One piece of
the film cannot be separated from
another and stored .in memory for
later reference. Polanski does not ask

.us be analytical, _just interested and‘

receptive. T here is really not much

for us to do on ourown in viewing the ..
film,‘ nor should there be. It * is
- Polanski telling _'Hardy’s‘ story.

Between the two of them, the kinks

, have been worked out and the story

complete. There is no place for us in

the meaning of the film. ‘

After Tess is- impregnated, she‘
leaves the D’Urberville estate. This is
the point in the film where Polanski's
judgements are most apparent. She is
walking home with her bags, yet
unaware that she is with child. Then
in the next scene,'she is breastfeeding
a baby boy‘ on her lunchbreak from
working in the fields. This is the type
of cutting that, were it not done,
could prove to be the extraneous
non-progression. We know Tess by
this ’time,.and have developed feel-
ings for her, but nothing sophisti-
cated enough tofhave any “kind. of

success in reading her feelings in the '

period "of her pregnancy. It is one,

~ undoubtedly, of much introspection
* ,and pain and hate on her part, but to

\translate these to the screen would
have been-risky.\Much of it most
' likely would have turned out ambigu-

ous and overly mystical, something

that Polanski had to avoid to hold his
viewer's interest. 
' The only difficulty with Tessis Nas-

tassia Kinski. It is not her talents that

are lacking, but" her ‘chance to’ use

 them to thefullest. Maybe this has to

do with the character, wlﬁ> suffers so

much throughoutithe film that_ she _ A

can do nothing else but walk around

_.-‘dazed and drugged with grief. She

does seem rather too soft and ineffec-
tual at times, but Kinski has her
moments, enough to make one aware
that she can act,‘ and is notjust a
mediocre first-timer overrated from

,' being swaddled in_tPolanski’s genius.
' For its length and theme, ‘Tess is an’
unquestionable success, true to its_

medium while establishing itself as a
work of art. ‘ ‘ .

Groomes, production manager of the
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, "theater
people are magic. What I do is magic
to myself and many others.”

The 28-year-old California native
has- had a lot of experience making
theater magic. Before coming‘ to
Pittsburgh, in fact, before becoming
involved with ballet, Groomes
worked in many different types of
productions. His theater career
began when, at 14, he read for a part
in his highschool play, Shaw's Bury the
'Dead and, to his"surprise, got it.

"I fell in love," he says of the expe-
rience. ”It was the first time some-
thing grabbed me and I haven't come
up since.”

He spent the next six years acting
almost exclusivelyiin 40 shows, back
to back. In 1971 he ‘ discovered
another "beautiful” aspect of the
theater, lighting design.

says. "It's subtle-pure
psychology.”

While attaining an Associate Arts
degree in design and management at
Grossmont College and attending
San Diego State University, Ron
worked on numerous productions in
various capacities, such as stage’man-
ager, lighting designer, technical
director, and assistant production
manager. He also worked behind the
scenes for several stars, such as
actress Dorothy Lamour and female
impersonator Jim Bailey.

Groomes says that a person makes

likes to have several things going on
at one time. Immediately before join-
ing the PBT, he worked simultane-
ously with the San Diego Symphony
Orchestra, the San Diego Ballet
Company, and a San Diego project
designing firm.

He came to the PBT last year, "rela-
tively new to dance," he claims, but
says that his job here is ”thrilling to
me. There is nothing else I'd rather
do." '

As production manager of Pitts-
burgh's only professional ballet com-

\

pany he is, in his own words,-

"responsible for the entire over-view
of the on-stage production.” ' '
"I'm like a funnel," says Ron. "I

for it all coming together into an

He works with the other members
of the PBT’s production staff, the
costumer, stage manager, and techni-
cal director, to get the company, in its
eleventh season, on the Heinz Hall
stage. .

"We are the pathway on which eve-
ryone else treads," he adds.

Groomes says that he loves his
work and_cannot believe that anyone
can watch ballet and remain
unmoved. ' - I

tinues, ”to present something to

thing. A spark. This is the magic. To

"Patrick has something with his
Celebration, a PBT ballet. He's on the
right track. And the whole creative
process is just fascinating.”

The process that begins with a
vague idea and ends up a finished per-
formance takes months to develop.
Groomes says it is impossible to pre-
dict how many hours a weekhe will
put inpreparing for the 13‘-ballet sea-
son which will begin in October.

"My involvement with the com-
pany is total," Groornes states. "In a
good ‘week, we'll work a minimum of
40 hours. But during production we’
could go from 60' to 80. And on tour
we're working around the clock."

"Sometimes there are personality
clashes, or equipmenttrouble, but
the final performances make it all
worthwhile,”he concludes.

Ron says that he would like to
make changes within the PBT so that

That sort ofthing," he explains.
When asked about the future, he
says that his is "to be announced." 
"I am extremely enthused about
where I am now. I know I'm extraor-
dinarily lucky, but I'm thrilled to
death to be here," he claims. "I may
not make as much as ‘other people,
but I love what I do and that's vital to
me. And, assuming the survival of
our economy, I think that the best is

PANINTINGS AND PRINTS BY
ROBERT EAGERTON

‘UP Gallery

Forbes Avenue and Bouquet Street
February 4 - March 1

By MYRLE KAYE

If you walked past the UP Gallery _ I

in February, brilliant blues, reds, and
striking fleshtones, visible through

the gallery's spacious windows, prob-'
ably caught your eye. Adramatic '

show of paintings and prints ran at

‘ the gallery through March 1. Robert

Eagerton's works encouraged a range
pf strong reactions: enthusiasm,

admiration, and even disgust.

Eagerton took emotional risks in
the show. His sensual treatment of
‘nude female figures. These dominant
figures pulsed with an undercurrent
of feeling and many of them conjured
an erotic atmosphere.‘ Despite the

emphasis on provoking a definite

response from the viewer, Eagerton's

-I paintings and especially the litho-

. ’ graphs stood strong on their techni- ’

~ _ cal foundations. His treatment of the
xtnedia held together as consistently
 ine.

Ejagerton, a 40-year old artist who
teaches at the Herron School of Art

"  in Indianapolis, said, "I work to pro- 
zvoke response ‘in myself. I'm .a very
it emotional person. I hope it provokes
_.._a response in others.”

Eagertonscompositions included a
variety of symbols--stars, hearts, and
red brushstrokes that flickered in and

  out of compositions like tongues of
 : flame. He said, "Symbols represent
 ‘things. Ixhave my own interpreta-
‘ " tions of those things and Idon't think
"".it’s' essential ‘to know” what \they

0' represent to me to get someth_i—ng out

g of the work." ,- *

sitting‘ around Eagerton's studio for
years, nor has his choice of subjects
remained consistent during his

career. "I started working with ele—’

phants in the 50's and 60's," he said.
"My work was very abstract, as many
artist's work was at that time. I
became involved in working with fig-
ures in the late 60's. My studio i‘s~on
an island of_f South Carolina. It's a
desolate isolated place. I work every
day of the week andprefer to work at
night. I have astronger feeling for my
work in‘the evenings." _

Eagerton said that he tries to create
a fantasy world using areas, people,
and things. He attended the Atlanta
College of Art, the Academy of Fine
Arts in Venice, and then went on to
advanced work in Cranbrook, Micha-
gan. He is‘ from Beauford, South
Carolina. I . '

''I read a lot of Southern writers,"
he said. ”They, have a great under-
standing of moments of value. Itry to
do the same thing, to ’make, other

THE JIM CARROLL BAND
The Startracker '
February 17, 1981

BY SAM MATTHEWS

There wasn't even any action in the
Mens room. We the audience were
made to believe that Jim Carroll
would hit the stage like the messiah

at 8 o'clock. By nine a local- outfit

called Nomad played. At eleven still
no Jim ‘Carroll. Tension mounted.
After standing aroundin a bar with
the ambiance of a frat basement for a
couple of hours the audience was
noticably hostile. You can't afford to
drink, you can't leave, you just do
burn time. 'DVE dj's came on to
entertain. The audience wasn't too
polite. '

Meanwhile, Jim Carroll rounds the
corner into the dressing room. Finally
he appears. 1

”What’s your f ———— —— prob-
lem?” inquires a paying customer. _

"I got lukemia this afternoon” says

‘Carroll and the band explodes into

”Wicked Gr_avity.""Sisters" followed. I

The notion of a poet working in
rock and roll has been popular since
Jim Morrison. Part of theattraction is
the shamanistic element of the per-
sonal-ity of the performer. Morrison
had it, and Patti Smith almost did. But
Patti Smith's biggest contribution to
the genre was street credibility. Jim
Carroll explodes with credentials. A

and dunking is published and nomi-
nated for a Pulitzer Prize.

A Shaman he isn't. Only during
"When The City Drops Into The
Night” he transended the normal
concert surroundings, and cliches.

Carroll's stage persona tended
towards that of a Lou Reed. He
looked loaded, the crowd wanted to
believe he was, but Carroll could pull
it together to sing/talk through the
lyrics. _He sang essentially onelsong
seven times. The band was compe-
tent and uninspired. Two new songs
were played. "Tension" rocked in a
”Wicked Gravity” vein, and "Angel"
was similar in structure to Smith's
"Birdland." J ~

"This isn't a song about death,”
began Carroll as he introduced "Peo-
ple Who Died.” As the band‘-blasted
through this -raveup about mishaps,
people danced. You wondered if they

listened to the words. The Lou Reed '

A influence ‘intensified.

Encore time and the selectionwas
”Sweet Jane,” (a Lou Reed song for
those who don't know the reference ,
points). The lead guitarists aped the
musical interplay of-the Rock and Roll’
Animal version as Carroll delivered j,-
the lyrics. Not with venom or even a "
hint of intensity. He leaned against a 
wall andjoined the crowd in watching 
his band.  .'

Jim Carroll is ‘not the poet of the

”Hi mister! What's your name?”,
asked the third grade boy seated
beside me with his parents.

Cheap Trick has always had a tal-
ent for cutting through the usual
audience demographics. They're
noisy enough for the hard rockers
and have plenty of melody for the.
musical purists. Combine this with
their cartoon image and the assump-
tion that the songs of Rick Nielson
have always been directed at the
twelve year old mind (witness the
message of ”Surrender”) to account
for oodles of teen appeal. Through-

The most disturbing aspect of this
year's concert was the inﬂuence of

  
   

Comita. In-the past Cheap Trick was 
never. the band for random jamming.
Their songs and arrangements..were
always structured to the tenth
degree. At times the musical inter-
play (using the term loosely) took on

‘all the bad points of heavy metal.

. And while‘ on the subject of heavy I
metal, the opening act, UFO, had a

Meanwhile, UFO plowed through
their set with all the sensitivity of a

"lights out Pittsburgh" creating some
instant audience identification. UFO
even mentioned the Steelers...

J.T.iTrys,* Comes ‘Up Dry

JAMES TAYLOR  
Stanley Theatre ~ ‘
February 21, 1981 J

By I.OHNETTE_ HOWARD ’

In "a. 1979 Rolling Stone interview,

James Taylor‘ said, "Sometimes I»

think maybe I'm getting too old to be
performing rock ’n' roll.” '

Maybe. Maybe it was an off-night. "
Maybe i.t_._was because most of the _

regular boys in. the‘ band aren't‘ with

Taylor on this tour. Or, maybe.it was '

just a case of Taylor's "reputation

exceeding ‘his performance. ' t‘ _
The sellout crowd at the Stanley

gave Taylor‘ a standing ovation

‘before he had even played a note,

which shows the expectations Taylor
can arouse in an audience. But Taylor
never totally fulfilled" them, ibreezing
through two 45-minute sets of
trimmed-down versions of most of
his hits, playing a repitoireof what he
called ”a lot of acoustic stuff and a

' little bit electric.” Taylor's ch'aract‘eri-. A
zation was_right—literally and figur-

atively. Though enjoyable, the

performance generated" about- as.

much excitement as Rodney Danger-_
field in fish net stockings.

" Well, if you want excitement, you _

go ' to see" Ted Nugent,‘ swinging
‘around the*Civic Arena in a loincloth,

right? To expect Taylor. to beltout’

two hours of fast-paced,rockers is
wrong. What he does excel at is his
"acoustic stuff", and what makes him

agood is his ability to_ move an

audience in a different, low—key way
with his soft, introspective-songs and
soft rock numbers. '
