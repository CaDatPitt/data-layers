When a team from Pitt’s]umpstart
program arrived at Crescent Early
Childhood Center, a preschool in
Homewood, the class of 20 could
barely contain its excitement.
One student became so en-
thralled at seeing the Pitt students
who have worked with him since
the fall that he ran into the hallway
where the members of Jumpstart
were hanging their jackets in a
locker and embraced the leg of

one of the tutors. Another child “

grinned from the doorway as he

greeted tutors by name.
Jumpstart, a nationwide Ameri-

Corps program, aims to teach early

literacy and comprehension skills
to preschoolers in low-income
neighborhoods in order to reduce
the education gap that affects many
poor neighborhoods. During this
year’s National AmeriCorps Week,
which runs from Marchilo to 18,
Jumpstart at Pitt will partner with
other AmeriCorps organizations to
offer services to the community. '
Angela Gordon, Pitt’s Jumpstart
program coordinator, said that 115
Pitt students currently participate
in the University’s Jumpstart pro-
gram, which tutors a_total of 253
preschoolers in.12 classrooms
located in Braddock, Swissvale,
Mountwashington, Northside,

'East Liberty and Homewood.

crawl on Saturday with members
of other AmeriCorps organizations
across Pittsburgh as part of Ameri-
Corps week. During the event, the
members went from one service

project in the city to another based‘

on scavenger—hunt style clues.
Gordon expressed enthusiasm

about her organization’s oppor-
tunity to celebrate the week with-

other nonproﬁts.
“We try to do some sharing with
other AmeriCorps organizations,”

she said. “So it"s nice that we got.

invited to the service crawl.”

Gov. Corbett
  to Vi$,iiPitt 

on Friday  

By Gretchen Andersen
Senior Staﬂ"Writer

if - ‘ During his ﬁrst two years in office,

Gov. Tom Corbett has proposed
cutting Pitt’s state funding to half
of what it was before he took of-
ﬁce. And onvFriday, Pitt students
will have a chance to question him
about his ‘controversial budget pro-
posals.

, Corbett will be the next poli-
tician speaking at Breakfast and
‘Politics in the "William Pitt Union
Assembly’Room‘at 7:30 a.m on
Friday. Pitt’s Graduate and Pro-
fessional Student Assembly and

the event, which usually features a
local politician who gives a speech
and takes questions from students
over breakfast.

GPSA administrativeassistant
Thom_as Cunningham said this

event is important for students be- —

cause “we don’t often have the op-
portunity for such a high-ranking

' official to come to Pitt’s campus.”

Cunningham said each year
GPSA makes a list of government
oﬂicials its members would like
to bring to Breakfast and Politics.
This year, he said GPSA President
Nyasha Hungwe reached out to the

-governor’s office.

He said organizers do not know
what Corbett will speak about at
the event, but there will be pre-
screened questions from the au-
dience for the governor during a
question and answer session. SGB

students will also be able to write,

— in additional questions during the

breakfast, and SGB will also reach
out to both Pitt College Democrats
and Pitt College Republicans for
questions. .
Landreneau said Corbett’s visit
is just as imperative as Pitt Day in
Harrisburg, which will take place
today at the State Capitol build-
ing in Harrisburg. There, students
will talk with legislators about Pitt-
related issues, such as this_year’s
proposed 30 percent appropria-
tions cuts. '
Landreneau acknowledged that

Corbett’s visit will serve as an op-— '

portunity for members of the Pitt
community to learn about the pro-
posed budget cuts.

“There’s a lot of confusion and
angst about this topic, and this is
the guy who planned it. Students
will get to understand his ideol-
ogy about the cuts and offer their
judgement for why it should be
changed,” Landreneau said.

The Governor’s Press Office said
they could not conﬁrm Corbett’s
visit because they do not release
the governor’s schedule until 24
hours in advance. _

The event, usually known as
Pancakes and Politics, will not be
serving pancakes on Friday be-
cause Landreneau said SGB is'wan-
ing down the funding for the event
since not enough undergraduates
attend. However, Sodexo will cater
the breakfast, which will feature
bagels and juice. F

Students can pick up free tick-

ets to the breakfast, at which seats
will be limited, in room 848 of
the William Pitt Union. There are
300 tickets available in total, to be

split between undergraduates and

graduates. .

The doors will open at 7 a.m: '

and breakfast will beserved from

7:30 to 8. Corbett will address the
"audience at 8:15. '

“We are acutely aware of fund-

V ing cuts. GPSA is trying to take a

leadership role. We don’t have an
organized message, but we believe

state education is valuable and the _

time is right to increase ﬁmding
after years of decreasing ﬁmding,”

_ Cunningham said.

The ticket reads that event at-
tendees will go through airport-
like security and are encouraged
to bring as few personal items as
possible. No signs, banners, post-
ers, liquids, umbrellas, laptops,

computers or bookbags will be al— -

lowed in the venue. Cameras will
be permitted.

“This is an opportunity to gal-
vanize support for opposition to
the funding cuts,” Cunningham
said. . . /

Vice Chancellor Robert Hill said
in anemail that after Breakfast and
Politics, Governor Corbett and
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg will
visit the Swanson’School of Engi-
neering and the Center for Energy.
Hill said that while at Swanson,
they will discuss Pitt’s certiﬁcate
program in nuclear engineering.

“This an important opportunity
to demonstrate Pitt’s accomplish-
me nts and the University’s extraor-
dinary contributions to research,

as well as to the economy of the
southwestern Pennsylvania re-
gion,” Hill said.  '

“I am Very, very thankfulfor _

the support that [the University]

Pitt students who work for the

program participate in planning.

sessions and attend two classes at
the local schools every week during
which they each work closely with
two or three children.

Each of the 12 teams within
Pitt’s jumpstart program is led by
a member who has had at least one

‘ year of experience. Gordon ‘said

the program also employs three

full—time site managers who man-_ ‘
age the teams and supervise the_

implementation of the _curric'u-'

‘ lum.

_ Gordon said most of the stu-
dents who participate in the

program commit to 300 hours.

throughout the year, including
60 hours of training before they.
work with a.class. She noted that 25
of Pitt’s Jumpstart students could
only commit to 220. hours through-
out the year.

Gordon added that team lead-
ers go through additional training,

such as the weekend—long Septem— -

ber Leadership institute, at which
they practice planning and leading

  

classroom sessions.

Once in the classroom, each tu-
toring session focuses on a core
storybook, which Corps members
"read aloud to groups of two or

three preschoolers. - . ~
V When junior Nicky Saputo’s
-team. visited the Crescent Early

Childhood Center on March 1,
they read “Dear Juno,” a picture
book by Soyung Pak about a child
who corresponds by_mail with his

. grandmother. .. -

Laura Buccigrossi, a junior, sat

near a corner with a young boy and _

girl, 3 and 5 years old, respectively,-
who huddled closely and looked on
intently as she read “Dear Juno”

to them. Buccigrossi stopped oc— .

casionally to ask them questions
and have them repeat information
to check their comprehension of
the material. I ‘

At a table _closer to the middle

' of the room, Sahil Amin ﬁnished

reading “Dear Juno” to his three
students a‘ little early. He picked
up a small stack of cards that he
had set on the table and removed-
the metallic ring that held them
together. ‘

“This is just a small trick I
showed them to pass the time when
we ﬁnish reading,” Amin said.
“'I‘-hey spin the ring [while] I ask
them questions about the story,”
he said as his students excitedly
began passing the ring back and
forth. 4 D .

Jennifer Cooley-Matesic, who
teaches the preschool class Sapu-

that, in order to enhance the at-
tention her students receive during
their small-group sessions with
‘Jumpstart’s tutors, she gives the
tutors guidance about the needs
of individual students.

With the consent of her‘ pupils’
parents, she makes recommen-
dations to the tutors about the
learning needs of ,her individual
students. l '

“I noticed that some of my kids
were having trouble telling a story

with a beginning, middle and end,” "

Cooley-Matesic said. “So Itold [the
Jumpstart tutors], and now they

- focus on that during story time.”

During each session, the core
storybook provides. a framework .
for theother learning activities ,

that the tutors prepare for the. '

children. Because letter writing
ﬁgured so prominently in ‘FDear‘
Juno,” this session incorporated;
letter writing and mail as a theme
for most of the activities.

ond year as a team leader, has
Worked forjumpstart since she was

Students and faculty at universities
like Pitt should all join the move-

academic journal articles. Freely

of opportunity, but also with the

and at other universities, prospec-
tive researchers somehow do their
work in a limited-subscription en-
vironment.

In recent years, according to
Pitt’s University Library System
Director Rush Miller, the cost of

journal subscription and public

‘ support for higher education
have steadily moved in oppo-
site directions, resulting in
decreasing access to pri-
 vate journals (but not for

Pitt, which keeps footing

the rising bill).

vate publishers and made true on their re-
alization -— in the past 10 years, more than
9,000 open—access journals have sprung up,
according to Miller. Open-access journals
generally disseminate publications exclu-
sively through the Internet, and the money
needed to organize peer review seems to be
raised by three general means: private or

‘ public grants, author fees or institutional

support (Pitt sponsors about 20 open—access
journals). ‘ .
Additionally, since 2008 all articles
that refer to work paid for by the National
Institutes of Health automatically appear

in the NIH’s open—access PubMed Central,
but private journals have ‘a 12-month “em-
bargo” period in-which to sell subscriptions.
Some universities, like Pitt and MIT, also
encourage faculty to put their publications
in institutional open-access “repositories”
whenever they submit publications to pri-
vate journals. ‘ -

Whatever today’s norms might be, there’s
no substantive reason why open—access jour-
nals shouldn’t be just as respected as private,
subscription-based journals. According to a
review composed by a Pitt task force headed
by Miller, articles in free journals are receiv-
ing at least as many citations as private-
journal articles and even more readership.

This open—access snowball is most cer-

tainly rolling, but it should roll faster. Here
are some obvious next steps:

1. Change the culture. Not all academic
scientists seem to know about open access,
let alone support it. This could and should be
changed through more rigorous awareness
efforts. What does a start look like? There’s
currently an online declaration for faculty
across the globe to announce their refusal to
submit or review material for publications
under the Elsevierlabel at www.thecostof—
knowledge.com. To date, only eight Pitt af-
ﬁliates have signed that declaration.

2: Don’t stop at embargoes. The PubMed

Central open—access model is surely better i

than nothing, but especially for biomedical
researchers, there’s an indubitable value in
having real-time access to research prog-
ress, as opposed to year—later access.

3. Make this a case about tuition. Miller
said the ULS spends $500,000 extra each
year just to sustain the current subscription
level. It’s hard to believe the recent tuition
increases ‘(and similar ones at other universi-
ties) have nothing to do with that. E '

By Kira Scammell
Staff Writer

After" 15 years of serving cuppas, indie coffee
shop Kiva Han permanently closed its doors
onjan. 19, leaving Oakland with only big—name
corporationspserving up its morning joe. V

Between the ‘Starbucks on Forbes Avenue
and the’ Starbucks on Craig.Street, there is
Caribou Coffee, Dunkin’ Donuts, Einstein Bros.
Bagels and 7—Eleven. The only independently

_ owned coffee chain in the area is Crazy Mo-

cha, but the Oakland location isn’t open on
weekends. , .

Major corporations such as Starbucks in-
troduced the world to specialty coffee when the
business started booming in the mid 1990s.
Words like “cappuccino” and “latte” soon be-
came elements of everyday vocabulary. But
as those corporations have grow larger, the
focus has inevitably shifted from the custom-
ers and the coffee to something standardized
and economic. Representatives of Starbucks

' did not wish to comment.

Though they might require a trip outof
Oakland, independent coffee shops are still
wo'rking.to serve up cups to please Pittsburgh’s
palate. . E

y Coffee Tree Roasters

‘ V Coffee Tree, one of Pittsburgh’s leading in?
dependent coffee chains and roasters, focuses

on ﬁnding the best quality coffee available.
“Our search has really been to get the best
on the market that wecan buy. Really only 10
percent of coffee in the world is specialty,” said
chain founder Bill Swoope.
With only ﬁve locations, Coffee Tree has the

’ ability to be picky about its beans. ‘ y

“The big companies can’t play with what
we play with.‘ Say they need 5,000 bags, and
we can get away with only having 100 bags. We

small crop, and it’s enough,” Swoope said. For

Coffee Tree, it has always been about quality

a over quantity, he said.

Zeke’s Coffee ‘ - , -
T ‘ This small—batch roaster shop is tucked int
blooming East Liberty. Chris Rhodes opened

.up shop on his own in May 2011. . '

“I roast by the pound in a ﬂuid-bed coffee
roaster. That kind of coffee roaster keeps the
temperature consistent. The beans are always
moving, or ﬂuid, so they all get roasted evenly,”

said Rhodes. “Because the beans are roasted in _

small batches and ground immediately before

brewing, the customer always receives th .

freshest-tasting coffee.” i
Rhodes’ focus goes beyond fresh coffee; he
also wants to maintain a personal. relationship

A with his customers. His goal this year is to sell l
more coffee by the cup than he did last year

i since he has. already developed a strong fan
base with the surrounding community, which E

typically buys for businesses. .

He is also currently working on reﬁning
the shop’s interior, which includes a rotating
selection of artwork from Pittsburgh Public

Schools. ‘-

use the right brewing techniques to evoke the

“We have a high emphasis on really good
coffee, but also on people. People always de-
scribe this place as kind of the ‘Cheers’ of coffee
shops because we get to know our customers
and pretty much everyo ne’s name and ‘drink
order. We like to have a relaxed feel to our shop.
Plus, we are in Lawrenceville, which is a great
neighborhood because of the Variety of people
that come here,” owner Matt Gebis said.

21st Street Coffee and'Tea

Even during an off—day in the Strip District, .

a constant ﬂow of customers grab a cup of

 

  

coffee at the 21st Street Coffee and Tea. The
shop is best known for its pour—over coffee,
which it prepares by setting a grounds-ﬁlled
ﬁlter cone into a cup and pouring hot water
over it to steep. See our coffee guide for more
information on this method.

“You have to start with a good product.
Serving it fresh per—cup ensures that all the
hard work we’ve done is getting to the cus-
tomer,” said Alexis Shaffer, a co—owner of the
cafe. A. . _

The shop focuses on keeping coffee simple
and making sure the staff fulﬁlls its custom-
ers’ needs. Employeesiare more than willing
to give instructions and recommendations to
best suit the customers. . V
“We try to show this to people —— how they

 

can do this at home. It’s very transparent. We
also hold classes and coffee tastings. We are
unique in that we care, and our main intent is
to give something to the customer, something
they enjoy. We want to make the customer
happy,” Shaffer said. _ _ '_

Panthers win EWL

By Dustin Gabler
Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team captured
the Eastern Wrestling League tour-
nament title on Sunday for the sec-
ond year in a row.

The Panthers clinched the
135.5—11.5 victory over Edinboro
following competition in the
174-pound weight class.

Six Panthers earned automatic
bids to the NCAA Tournament that
will be held in St. Louis starting
March 15'.

125 Pounds _

In the lowest weight class, No.
15 junior Anthony Zanetta earned
the top seed with his perfect record
in EWL duals. A

With a ﬁrst—round bye and a
major decision, 10-2, over Lock
Haven’s Bobby Rehm, Zanetta ad-
vanced to the ﬁnals for the third
straight year. The top two wres-
tlers from the EWL earn automatic
bids to the NCAA Tournament, so
Zanetta became Pitt’s ﬁrst quali-
ﬁer.

Zanetta matched up with» West .

Virginia’s Shane Young in the ﬁ-
nals. The two met in the past two
seasons’ EWL ﬁnals with Zanetta
taking both previous matches.
 “That was the sixth time I wres-
tled him in three years,”=Zanetta
said. “I had an idea of what the
match had in store for me.”

The Pitt junior wrestled a cau-
tious ﬁrst period and remained
scoreless after holding off several
good shots from the Mountaineers’
Young.

“In the EWL ﬁnals, it’s easy to
be cautious through the ﬁrst pe-
riod because your nerves get to
you,” Zanetta said. “Nobody wants
to make a mistake at first.” _

Young chose to wrestle neutral
in the third period, and the Pan-

thers’ 125-pound wrestler needed a

to make a move if he wanted his
third-straight EWL champion-
ship.

“Ijust had to let it rip and go get
a takedown,” Zanetta said.

Pitt opts
to compete
in CBI  

By Kelly Flanigan
Staﬁ" Writer

To the dismay of Panther fans ev-

erywhere, Pitt’s worst season in

more than a decade will not come

‘to an end.

After riding a seven-game con-
ference losing streak in mid-winter,
Pitt knew its hopes for getting into
the NCAA Tournament were slim.
The team ﬁgured_it' would have to
settle for playing in the National
Invitation Tournament as a back-
up, although acceptance of an NIT
bid would cause slight embarrass-
ment for a program that has not
missed an NCAA Tournament ap-
pearance during head coachjamie
Dixon’s 10-year reign.

_ But after being passed up by the
NIT committee on Sunday night,
Pitt will play Wofford at 7 p.m. on
March 14 at the Petersen Events
Center as part of the College Bas-
ketball Invitational.

Sixteen teams will compete
in the CBI, but cross-city rival
Duquesne will not;be one of those
teams, as it rejected its potential
bid in an effort to instead focus on
recruiting and moving on to the
next season. Opponents are argu-
ing that Pitt should have done the
same, as even advancing through
and winning this tournament will

_ provide few tangible beneﬁts.

So why compete‘? Dixon says
it is an opportunity to get more
experience for the young players
on his team. It gives players an op-
portunity to see where they need
to improve and the team an oppor-
tunity to assess holistic strengths
and weaknesses.

' “Our guys want to play,” he said.
“Given our youth, this is an event
that is important to us. We’re ex-
cited about the opportunity. We
know’ [Wofford] and how good
of a program they are. They’ll be
very anxious and excited for this
game, just like we are. They have
a lot of seniors -— they are expe-
rienced.” A

“College Basketball Invitation-
al” seemed to be a painful utterance
for Dixon at Monday afternoon’s

Robert Griffin Illa good “fit

l\/larch T8,” 201 21 The Pittl\lev\/st ]f\/wvw'.pittnevvs.00m

for Washington, D.C.

By Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

Finally, the Washington Redskins have done
something I’m excited about.

Come fall, Robert Grifﬁn III will be the
13th starting quarterback for the Redskins
since the 2001 season. '

Washingto n’s owner Dan Snyder can only

. hope it will be a lucky 13..

After giving up so much — a ﬁrst round
pick in 2012, 2013 ‘and 2014, as well as a
second-round pick in this year’s draft e
the team will experience the effects of a few
enormous implications: f

Firstly, the Re_dskins have completely
bought the hype on Grifﬁn. To give away
what they gave away in order to move up
four spots inthe draft, the scouts musthave
seen something from Grifﬁn that put them
over the edge. I

Secondly, Grifﬁn just became the most
valued quarterback in the NFL draft. Did you
hear that, Andrew Luck? While you try and
replace Peyton‘ Manning in what hasbeen a
successful franchise, Griffin will be stepping
into a lost organization —— one that just put
all the eggs of their future in his basket.

Thirdly, this means that the Redskins
think they can build around Grifﬁn through

free agency. They don’t have a pick in this ’ .

year’s draft after Grifﬁn until the third
round, -and they’re $40 million under the
cap. With names like Vincent Jackson on
the market, you can expect Washington to
throw a lot of money at big talents.

' So while theprice was monumental, how
should all the other Redskins fans and Ifeel
now? Only Grifﬁn’s play will prove his worth,
but for now, we should all be happy.

While most dreadlocked, athletic, hu-
man—highlight—reel football players seem
pompous and arrogant, Griffin is humble,
well spoken and intelligent. ‘

Grantland writer Michael Weinreb de-
scribed him as “one of the most self—aware
and charismatic and intelligent football

players I’ve everspent time around.”
As a political science major who was

. called “The Ambassador” by his team-

mates in college, Weinreb even speculated

that Grifﬁn’s future in D.C. could be just as '

important in the political arena as on the
gridiron. He will be the face of the nation’s
capital during one of the most tumultuous
times our country has ever seen. His impact
could be beyond any of our expectations.

' . Surely, ,Grifﬁn will have to win Washing-
ton’s heart on the ﬁeld with his play. But

‘ aside from an injury (I’ve already had one-
— nightmare), not much can go wrong. Grif- .

ﬁn is big, strong and incredibly fast. He is
the median between Mike Vick and Cam
Newton, perhaps even _a reincarnation of
Redskin great Doug Williams. ’

When quarterbacks have strong arms
and freakish mobility, things always stay-
interesting. Even when the Carolina Pan-

. thers were losing last year, how often did

you watch Cam Newton on.TV? I bet ev-

' ery Panthers fan enjoyed their 6-10 los-

ing season with Newton at the .l_1el1ri more
than,t‘ho_se 9-7 “winning” seasons withjake
Delhomme. _ -

' Besides, who elsewould be the Redskins

‘ quarterback‘? Peyton Manning is too smart

and too slow to play in D.C. in a system
that relies on a quarterback’s mobility. Rex
Grossman showed us all he’ll never be a
winner. John Beck proved he’s an average
backup quarterback. That leaves  Kyle
Orton? No thanks.

So in this upcoming year, Redskins fans

I can look forward to a quarterback who

knows what to say and when.to say it.
They will see Vick and Grifﬁn going head
to head  twice. We will all get to utter that

l _ super ﬂy nickname, “RG3,” whenever we

want.Jersey sales will go up. Ticket sales will
go up. Our team will be back in the ﬁrst 30
minutes of SportsCenter. We’ll be in top plays

and popular highlights, followed closely by -
everyone in the country and, shoot — we-

might even’ win a few games! I

‘ press conference. He used the phrase “It’s

not the NCAA Tournament” nearly 10 times,
although he countered the assertion with,
“but this is where we landed.” However, he
says he knew before the CBI called that ‘Pitt

The players seem " _
"happy for the extra opportunity to compete
as well. Sophomore guardJ.J. Moore said the
team was obviously initially disappointed
but appreciates the chance to extend its
season. .

“We want to try to look to win something
instead of going out with a loss,”.Moore said.

“Itis deﬁnitely a stepping stone for next year. ,

We fell short this year. We feel that this will
make us play harder because we don’t want
the same reaction next year.”

. Moore is one of the team’s younger‘play-

ers who will undoubtedly beneﬁt from a bit
more experience. Having played increas-
ingly well in the last ﬁve games of the sea-

son, Moore will still look to improve his

defense. «I .-

“I think I’m playing well, and my team- .

matesjthink I’m playing well, too,” Moore
said. “I think I did both of these at the end
of the season.” : .

. “Teams go through-rebuilding years, and
this is a rebuilding year for us,” freshman
Malcolm Gilbert added. “We’re keeping our

I heads high, and now we are moving for-

ward focusing on gettingbetter and getting
stronger.” _ 

Gilbert cites getting used to‘ the speedof
the game and the team’s sets as beneﬁts he
will gain from extending the season.

“It’s a mental battle out there,” he said.

“The extra practice time will help me go I

harder defensively. Now we can still battle
each other to make each other better and

unique, and every situ-

ation isfdifferent. I felt that having a game

‘_ to play for would give us something to look

forward to,” Dixon said.
— . Despite the fact’ that the CBI will be

primarily an opportunity for the younger ,

members of the team, Dixon‘ is still focused

on winning. _ A - .
“We need to have our best team on the

ﬂoor and play our best basketball. We’re

going to try anclbe the bestgteam we can

be,” he said. ’
Moore agreed. ,
“We’re trying to do this for the seniors,”

he said. “We want to win something for them’

and play as a team. It’s good for the younger
guys like me, but at the same time it’s for
the seniors.” , I ' j '
When asked how he felt the turnout would
be for the game, Dixon could not be both-
ered. “We’ve never dealt with as short of
aturnaround as this before,” Dixon said.
“We’re in different circumstances. If we don’t
sell a lot of tickets. I don’t think that reﬂect's
anything about where we are or what we’ve
done.” ‘ .  -'
’ Even after the team’s hardships, Dixon

‘ is still not making excuses for his squad.

Instead, he is focused on Wofford and ad-
vancing through the CBI. “We understand
the situation that We’re in, and we recognize
that,” he said. '

‘ “We don’t make any excuses for it. We’re ’
trying to win a game. That doesn’t change .

notqmatter who you’re playing.” 1
