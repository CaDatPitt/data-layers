O'Connor Waiting for student input on salary plan

By Christine Hanna

News Editor

Although Senate Council
passed the compensation policy
recommendations, Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
said he would not take any
immediate actions on it until the
student concerns are on his
desk.

According to the Chancellor’s
Ad Hoc Committee on

Compensation’s recommenda-
tion, four components factor
into whether or not staff or fac-
ulty members receive a salary
increase. Maintenance of real
salary, merit increases, equity
adjustments and market adjust-
ments are those components
taken into consideration.

What was questioned at yes-
terday"s Senate Council meeting
was whether or not students

performing satisfactory or meri-
torious.

Under the recommendations,
“criteria for satisfactory perfor-
mance may be further specified
by the faculty and the head of
the unit. through collegial
processes  and judgments of
relative merit ‘within a depart-
ment or school should be made
in accordance with explicit,
written criteria and procedures

By Scott Carpel
For The Pitt News
  While yesterday marked the celebra-
" tion of Christopher Columbus’ first
 9- steps in America, some students at the

University of Pittsburgh protested 501
years of oppression.

This was just one of the ideas por-
trayed yesterday in front of the
William Pitt Union where many stu-
dent groups protested the University
of Pittsburgh’s involvement in the
Mount Graham Project.

Pitt, which had been asked by the
University of Arizona to invest $15
million in the Mount Graham tele-
scope project in Arizona last year, has
yet to make a decision.

The project involves two telescopes
in Arizona, the Vatican and the Max
Planck. The university has been asked
to invest in the building of the third
telescope, Columbus.

Pitt was among 30 or so other insti-
tutions that were asked to invest in
this project, including
Aeronautics and Space Administration,
the Smithsonian Institution and
* i I Harvard University. These groups all
E declined the offer.

Pitt Chancellor]. Dennis O’Connor
was cordially invited to the Rally,
according to Olivia Kissel, business
manager of the Student Environmental
Action Coalition. According to univer-
sity spokesperson Mary Ann Aug, the
whole issue is still under study by the
University of Pittsburgh.

and the head of the unit.”

“I feel that if faculty are going
to be rewarded based upon
merit for teaching, that the
effect of their teaching based on
students’ reactions is necessary
in determining whether they
should receive a salary
increase,” Student Government
Board member Tara Munkatchy
said.

According to Munkatchy, the
students’ role in determining

the National

Panel tal/es about Coming out

whether a faculty member is
teaching satisfactorily through
teaching evaluations should be
taken very seriously.

The Educational Policy
Committee will look into the
issue and then report back to
O’Connor.

SEAC unites with other
roupstto rally

The purpose of this rally was to tell
students why this project is not in the
best interest of the university, accord-
ing to co-organizer of the protest and
SEAC member Matthew Peters.

The rally included members of:
Allegheny Earth First; Alliance for
Progressive Action; Bisexual, Gay and
Lesbian Alliance; Black Action Society;
Campus Women’s Organization;
Pittsburgh Students for Peace; Student
Action Union and various local chap-
ters of the Student Environmental
Action Coalition.

The main purpose of this rally was
to “educate and inform people about
what is going on,” Josh Knauer, SEAC
member, said. “To inform and not
push opinions so that you can decide

. to inform and let people know
about the irresponsibility of the uni-
versity.” He also said it was important
that the rally was held in a responsible
manner. “We will continue to keep
pressure on the university and isolate
individuals involved in the decision
making process,” Knauer said.

He said the group will make it
known throughout the university com-
munity that those individuals involved
“do not support ethnic diversity, and
that they are not interested in real sci-
ence if Pitt becomes involved in this.”

The rally included live entertain-
ment and jugglers. Protesters carried
signs which read “501 years of oppres-
sion” and “Africans support your

After making it through law school on
loans, going to class at night and work-
ing everyday, most students would not
ﬁnd any problem with a job which paid
back $20,000 in a single month.

Milton Raiford said that after winning
his first eight cases as a defense attor-
ney, he knew something was wrong. “I
was just getting people off the hook,”
Raiford said. “I’ve learned that what
people need is what you have inside of
you. They need the wisdom which you

have gained through your experience.”

Raiford, a defense attorney, told stu-
dents last night to look past the materi-
alism of the world and realize that “it is
more important to be a good person
than a good lawyer.” Raiford, who also
serves as assistant pastor at the Mt.
Ararat Baptist Church, spoke openly
about the temptations of being a lawyer
in his speech sponsored by the Black
Law Students Association.

“The world wants you to think suc-
cess is greed and being a defense attor-
ney can be very lucrative,” Raiford said.

If coming out in college seems like a
challenge to some students, imagine
what it could be like in the workplace.

In recognition of coming out day, the
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance
held a discussion with people who did
more than just imagine. Last night the
group presented a panel of five local
gay and lesbian professionals who
shared personal experiences about
coming out at work. A

Experiences between the individuals
varied greatly. Some received negative

responses at their place ‘of work, others
positive. John Michael Curlovich was
fired from one of his jobs. “They
brought in a new facility manager and
she said, ‘I don’t have any room in my
department for a gay man.’ Two weeks
later, I was demoted,” said Curlovich.
He filed a lawsuit, which he won.
Dinah Denmark, a marketing execu-
tive at PNC Bank, said she had no
problem being out at her job. “I’ve
worked at advertising and public rela-
tions agencies. And I never came out.
Now I’m [out in] ‘corporate America’

and hey, it’s cool,” she said.

chosen to be on a task force to determine objectives and
strategies to enhance cultural diversity and re-evaluate the
progress Pitt has already made in this ar_ea.

O’Connor will chair this task force and said he wants to
have outlines and recommendations by June of 1994.

-O’Connor also said Pennsylvania Sen. Harris Wofford
requested that the university choose a group of experts to
examine and find potential problems in President Clinton’s
health-care reforms. ;

-Brody also said SGB will be purchasing a clock for the
corner of Bigelow and Forbes avenues in honor of former
Pitt Provost Donald Henderson, who left Pitt in August. SGB
is asking for minimum donations of $25 to help buy the
“Henderson clock.” “We are initiating this financial campaign
in hopes that members of the university’s faculty and staff
would like to make a donation, so that together we can show
our appreciation for Dr. Henderson and bring this monument
clock to our fair campus,” Brody said.

-Graduate and Professional Student Association President
Steve Parks said GPSA is looking into teaching awards —- one
for TAs and TFs and the other for part-time faculty. Students‘
could nominate teachers who they thought were exceptional,
Parks said.

-The Faculty Medical and Family Leave Policy,- which was
approved at the Oct. 5'Faculty Assembly meeting, was dis-
cussed.

Professor Herbert Chesler, chair of the Senate Benefits and
Welfare Committee, said the policy, if passed, would make
Pitt more of a “family-friendly institution.”

“Some clients never paid by
credit cardior check, they paid
in cash. The paid upfront, andl
did anything I could to get them

_off.” Raiford admittedthat in his

early days as a defense lawyer it
was exciting to keep a guilty
person out of jail. “It’s a rush,”
Raiford said. “Until the person
you got off kills one of your
friends.” He later related an
experience in which one of his
clients, after eluding conviction,
was involved in the injury of an
acquaintance.

However, it was after those
first eight wins that Raiford said
he realized God wanted him to
be more than just a lawyer.

.“Because society is—so sick,
often times people will try to

‘carve out their niche by unlaw-

ful means,” he said. “I also real-
ized that maybe the best thing
you can do for your community
is to be a prosecutor, though it
may mean prosecuting those
you love.” _
Several members of the audi-
ence, made up primarily of Pitt
law students, found Raiford’s

lN\’l£S'l‘ING

lecture a new angle on law
practice.

“I had never thought of a
lawyer in that way,” first—year
law student Donald Tibbs said.
“Lawyers are often called ‘coun-
selor,’ but I’ve never thought of
counseling a client in the way
[Raiford] talked about.”

Raiford urged students to use
their talents for a purpose, such
as improving their community

or the environment. “If we don’t

get our act together soon, chil-
dren who are seven years old
right now will never get to live
in a good community. Wrong
things are becoming the norm
in this society,” he said.

According to Raiford, when
one person sets a caring exam-
ple, many others often follow.
He said the apathy‘ of today’s
society is to blame for the rising
crime rates. “Everyone is
responsible. If you can pick up
a newspaper and not feel for
50,000 earthquake victims or
one murdered person, you need
to come on my job and go to a
morgue or see a child who was
just shot,” he said.

  IRONICALLY, THE TIME TO START
  SAVING FOR RETIREMENT IS WHEN IT LOOKS
LIKE YOU CAN LEAST AFFORD IT.

an't afford to save for retirement?

The truth is, you can't afford not to.
Not when you realize that your retirement
can last 20 to 30 years or more. You'll want
to live at least as comfortably then as you
do now. And that takes planning.

By starting to save now, you can take
advantage of tax-deferral and give your
money time to compound and grow.
Consider this: set aside just $100 each
month beginning at age 30 and you can
accumulate over $154,o31* by the time
you reach age 65. But wait ten years and
you'll have to budget $211 each month
to reach the same goal. '

Mount Graham project.”
The groups passed out
petitions and a fact sheet,
which informed students
why SEAC feels the
University of Pittsburgh
should not get involved in
this project.

The handout included
information about Mount
Graham and how, accord-
ing to SEAC, this project
will endanger the San
Carlos Apache Nation and
18 other plant and animal 1
species.

The $15 million invest-
ment could be used for
more important things at
this university like a bet— .
ter library, improved
security and an increase

. of staff workers’ salaries,

Peters said.

John Cihon, a SEAC
member, said the rally is
important because it is a
“chance to let people find
out what’s going on and
be aware of where their
money may go. We just
want them to know.”

Mike Kaizar, another
SEAC member, said the
goal of this rally is to stop
Pitt’s involvement. “We,
want to let the chancellor
know students at this uni-
versity are not behind
him,” he said.

Dave Ott, Student
Government Board mem-
ber, said, “There has to be
other sites the university
must find. If it’s causing
this much controversy,

1 then it’s just not worth it.

The university should
present the facts to the
students.” '

Pitt senior and amateur
astronomer Steven
Esposito, said, “lt’s a waste
of money if you are not ‘
going to get the best reso-
lution.”

Students, standing in
front of the union had
mixed opinions on Pitt’s
involvement. While some
students had no knowl-
-edge of the purpose of
the rally, there were some
who were actively con-
cerned.

Some members will
also sleep out in front of
the union until Thursday
night when another small
rally will convene.

Telescope brings clearer view

A newcomer to the University of Pittsburgh, in light of
recent Conﬂicts among different student organizations,
may very well conclude that the Pitt campus is full of
intolerance, racism, hatred, and that its members are
unable to get along with each other.

The letters to‘ the editor, which take aim at this organi-
zation or that one, fill The Pitt News editorial page
alarmingly often.

Whether it be anti—African American, anti-Jewish or
anti—white, lately members of Pitt’s community have
been "expressing very arrogant, and sometimes even
racist, views. * ‘

But students walking by the Fifth Avenue entrance of
the William Pitt Union yesterday may have gotten an
entirely different view of our campus community than
the one which may be ascertained by leafing through
the student newspaper. ‘ ‘

Students were kicking off the “Mt. Graham Vigil,” a

I protest which aims at informing the university adminis-

tration of the opposition and displeasure on the part of

many students, faculty and staff, in regards to Pitt’s ten- _
_ tative plans to co-sponsor a telescope-building project

-in Arizona in conjunction with the University of Arizona
and the Vatican. Students pointed out the scientific infe-
riority of the location, but more importantly, are con-
cerned with the welfare of the Apache tribe who deems

- the mountain sacred.

The question of the fragile ecosystems that exist on
Mt. Graham, which will be definitely threatenedby the
planned development, was also raised.

Besides seeing and hearing students voice their oppo-
sition to this project, passersby also enjoyed the music

performed by students taking part in the program and

were given the opportunity to sign petitions, which will
be passed on to Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor.

Most encouraging was the fact that several different
student organizations on campus, with very different

‘ agendas and outlooks, participated in this joint effort.

These student groups included: the Black Action
Society; the Campus Women’s Organization; the
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance; the Mt. Graham

Coalition and the Student Environmental Action
‘Coalition. '

According to Josh Knauer,‘a ‘co—op student at Pitt and
Carnegie Mellon and a member of the Mt. Graham
Coalition, the events went smoothly and without inter-
ruption. He was most impressed by how well the differ-
ent groups involved got along with each other in their
efforts to reach a common goal. ‘

Yesterday’s display of solidarity was one which goes
to show all members of the Pitt community that despite
the divergence of opinion in many areas, there exists
common ground on which to stand and work to
achieve common goals. ’ - ‘

Realizing ‘these similarities is the first step in settling
the differences.

Somalia becoming another quagmire

On,Oct. 3 the illusion of the
U.S. military’s mission in

-Somalia as being “humanitarian”

came to an abrupt and tragic
end,_After a 15-hour firefight
and the worst military debacle
since Vietnam, 17 U.S. soldiers
were dead and at least 78
injured. What had begun in
December 1992 as an attempt to
feed starving children has radi-
cally changed into a state of
war. This is a tragedy because it
is a war that the U.S. cannot,
nor should attempt to, win. This
mission has also done damage
to theimage of our military, as
President Clinton and Defense
Secretary Les Aspin continue to
change the objectives of the
mission.

Last December most
Americans, including me, sup-
ported, President Bush’s deci-
sion to try and reopen food sup-
plies to the Somalian people. In
the villages of Somalia that mis-
sion has been accomplished. It
is only the capital of Mogadishu
that is in chaos. This is largely
because of one warlord and the
history of the nation as a whole.

In the ancient culture of
Somalia, tribal loyalty is what
ties society together (and tears it
apart), and herein lies just one
of the many reasons why the
new U.S. mission to create,sta-
bility will fail miserably." There is
no central _governmer_i_t or civil
order and very little prospect
that the U.S. could establish a
workable government, no mat-
ter how long the U.S. and the
United Nations stayed there.
Furthermore, it is not ‘ the
responsibility of the U.S. to set
up governments in other coun-
tries, particularly one that is still
ruled by tribal values. It is the
role of the U.N. to nation-build,
but it is only possible when the
warring factions are willing to
settle their differences like civi-
lized people. This is the reason
for the success of the U.N. in

. Camb.Qdia;,,@.nd its. failure in

Yugoslavia-and Somalia. --
.. Mohamed Farrah Aidid
emerged in 1991 as one of two

leaders of Somalia after dispos— ,

ing of the dictator Mohamed
Siad Barre. Since then, Aidid
and his cronies have engaged in
a policy of terror, blackmail and
starvation tactics to stay in
power andattempt to win the
civil war. Aidid is a member of
the -Haber Gedir clan and is a
former army general. and
ambassador to India. He con-
trols his 6,000 or so fellow
tribesmen with drugs, bribery
and the promise“ that their clan

Tony
Dickensheets

will soon rule Somalia. In his
daily radio addresses he calls
the U.N. an “occupation force”
and urges the Somalian people
to fight U.S. soldiers. The most
horrifying demonstration of his
power over the people were the
pictures of people dragging the
body of a dead U.S. soldier
through the streets of
Mogadishu as the local popu-
lace cheered. Those pictures
make it very hard to justify this
mission as being “humanitari-
an.” It seems to be a contradic-
tion in terms. '

On Oct. 6 President Clinton
announced that he will send
5,500 more soldiers into East
Africa so that the U.S. can “con—
clude its role in Somalia.” The
problem with-this is that Clinton
has wafﬂed so badly and has
constantly changed the role of
the mission. Within a matter of
two weeks, the mission has
changed from humanitarian aid,
to the capture of Aidid (which
CNN could’ve done), to nation-
building, to C1inton’s plea on
Oct. 7 that the U.S. must “pre-
vent chaos.” That nation has
been in chaos for decades and
will continue to be long after

._the...U.S. lea.vf«es-..C—li=iatQri;..§.ur.s.t -dangerous quagmire. ' 
'doesn’t seem to realize that the ‘

role of the- military is not to pre-
vent chaos but to ﬁght and win

wars that are in the interest of
the U.S.

Clinton has now announced a
withdrawal date of March 31,
1994. But in the meantime an
additional 5,300 soldiers will be
deployed to Somalia. We
should immediately pull our
forces out of Somalia, because it
is impossible to restore order in
a nation with a barbarian bandit
as its leader. The U.S. military is
not trained to fight urban guer-
rilla warfare,and to put our sol-
diers in harms way for an addi-
tional six months is unforgiv-
able. No matter what we man-
age to accomplish in the next
six months, the situation will
remain chaotic long after we
have left. It is just not plausible
to create a civil society or a last-
ing coalition government in a
mere six months.

I feel sorry for the innocent
adults and children in Somalia
who only want to be left alone
to fann and live their lives, but
that does not change the reality
that there are tragic situations in
many countries all around the
world affecting millions of chil-
dren. The U.S. cannot, and
should not, send in our military
to all of those countries. There
are famines in the Sudan and
Ethiopia, and in many parts of
Southeast Asia millions of
young girls and women are sold
into prostitution. Where does
the U.S. draw the line? These

Pitt's "salvage"
Class of '97
makes its
mark on a
forgettable '93

: By Cory Walborn
senior’ staff Writer

The ad in the Pittsburgh
.Post-Gazette read this way:

For the low price of five
dollars, any youth can attain
Pitt football tickets for this
Saturday’s Homecoming game
with Syracuse ——'just call 648-
PITT. _

While the youth, no exact
age is speciﬁed, lets hisor her
fingers do the dialing, the
advertisement continues:

Flash: Marvin Graves, the
Orangemen’s All-American
quarterback, will be there.
Mike Ditka, former Panther
gridiron star, will also make a
halftime appearance. P

But the Steel City’s solo
flyer forgot someone, or V
rather something — Pitt’s own-
“kids.”

red ones. ' —

“We would prefer to red-
shirt all our freshmen,” Pitt
head coach John Majors said
yesterday at Pitt’s weekly
press conference. “But we
don’t have that luxury at the
University of Pittsburgh.”

How true. In fact, amidst a
1-4 start, Majors has been

forced to play several players.

he wouldn’t have under nor-
mal circumstances.

Jim Mal/The Pitt News

Pitt rookie Nate “Cochran has averaged over 43 yards a punt in two games as a starter.

But the circumstances sur-
rounding Pitt football are not
normal — they are drastic._
And drastic situations require
drastic measures.

Enter Pete Gonzalez, Pitt’s
rookie quarterback,’ who
made his first collegiate
appearance in the second
quarter of the Notre Dame
game last weekend.

“I thought about playing
him three weeks ago,” Majors

said. “But the Ohio State‘
game was so far out of reach,
we decided not to.

“But he’s unredshirted
now,” Majors added. “He
wanted to play, and he got
baptized.” '

Gonzalez was a nerve-rack-
ing 0-for-5 through the air
against the Irish. His only
pass that didn’t hit the ground
first ended up in the arms of
a Notre Dame defender, giv-

ing Gonzalez his first colle-
giate interception.

Meanwhile in South Bend,
another “sure” I'€ClSlllI't\I‘OOl(l€
was makingisome waves of
his own.

Punter Nate Cochran, who
replaced the injured Kevinl
Leon two weeks ago against
Louisville, solidified his role
with a great effort against
Notre Dame.

Kic/eing, defense makes Steelers contenders in weak AFC

This weekend the Pittsburgh Steelers
host the New Orleans Saints in what
could be an early indication of whether
or not the AFC could actually provide a
decent challenger for this season’s
Super Bowl.

The Saints may or may not be for
real. Head coach Jim Mora’s team has
started fast like this before and failed in
the postseason. Then again, it would
ma-ke sense if the Saints went all the
way in what has been the Year of the
Field Goal. Kicker Morten Anderson has
carried the Saint offense for years.

‘ It is on the Steeler side of things that
the real test lies. They are a young team
that has not yet proven its playoff met-

tle. They may also be the best the con- »

ference has to offer.

The AFC has been mostly mediocre
for years, and it is reaching a new. low
this season.

The one team that was making an
early claim to elite status was Miami.
The Dolphins had finally found a
defense and a semblance of a running
game to go along with the Hall-of-Fame

passing of Dan ,Marino...Then, _1v;_i,a,l;r1i’s,

Super Bowl chances snapped along

with Marino’s Achilles tendon.

Kansas City has the defense to win a
championship, but its offense is Nick
Lowery’s leg and a prayer when Joe‘
Montana is out, which is most always.

The Houston. Oilers still have world
champion talent and absolutely no clue
how to use it. Adding Buddy Ryan as
defensive coordinator has provided the

York defense is nowhere near it. Bubby
Brister and Vince Evans have brought
their teams back from large deﬁcits the
last two weeks against the Jets.

The San Diego Chargers were last
season’s beneficiary of the last place

schedule in the AFC West, good for a

playoff ticket. This year they are 2-3,

detonator for a team
that was ripe for self-
destruction after last
season’s postseason
choke in Buffalo.

‘The Bills still have
much of the talent that

  J Ryan  
Buncher

thanksto John Carney. _.

‘ ' Three things that killed
the Chargers all hap-
pened in preseason. One
is they didn’t get such an
easy schedule. Then
Bobby Ross handed the
quarterback job to over-

' put them in three straight Super Bowls,

but the point above was providing a
challenge for the NFC champion.

The rest of the so-called contenders
atop this season are early pretenders or
last year’s news.

After a fast start, Cleveland is now
turning the reigns of its bumbling
offense over to Vinny Testaverde. That
is like asking Wile E. Coyote how to use
your new ACME catapult correctly.

. Then th.¢.r.e.-a-re._t.11.e..J.ets.- Iioqmer J

Esiason is back on top, but the New

rated Stan Humphries, leaving talented
youngster John Friesz out in the cold
(sorry, couldn’t resist). Finally, Pro Bowl
cornerback Gil Byrd went out with a
knee injury, a loss from which their sec-
ondary has not yet recovered.

Denver is John E1way’s miracle and
the excellence of rookie kicker Jason
Elam (is this kicker stuff annoying or
what). Teams will ﬂy the friendly skies
against a weak Bronco secondary all

that it helps if a safety is not just an

undersized linebacker (i.e. Steve
Atwater).

That leaves the Steelers. The Steeler
offense is erratic. at best. Sunday was a
perfect example. Barry Foster rumbled
for 110 yards against a strong San Diego
defense, but quarterback Neil O’Donnell
was unable to make the key plays
against the depleted Charger secondary.

The Pittsburgh defense was devastat-

ing, giving up only one field goal on

138 total yards. They scored the only
touchdown of the game, Levon Kirkland
converting a fumble.

Last year Pittsburgh could not stop
the run or rush the passer. This year the
front seven have moved to another
level. Second—year players Kirkland and
nose tackle Joel Steed have developed.
Kevin Greene has been every bit as
good as advertised. Lloydhas raised his
game to an All-Pro level, as he and
Greene feed off of each other’s success.

The result has been decent pressure
on the quarterback and a stiflingrun
defense. The Steelers have given up
only 107 yards on 55 Carries in the last

Lacrosseclub settles forthird place at Bluegrass Fest

By Brady Slater
Staff Writer

A 50-9 record over the last’

three years and a national club
lacrosse title last spring have
the Panthers Lacrosse Club
believing that it can win every
game, every tournament.

Sunday night the Panthers
came home a little disappoint-
ed.

The Panthers beat Tennessee
10-7 Sunday to settle for a
third-place finish at the
Bluegrass Lacrosse Festival in

. Lexington, Ky.

The Panthers lost .' to
Vanderbilt 7-4 in the semifinals,

ruining their chance for the
tournament championship they
had expected to win.

‘‘\We should have won,”
defenseman Tim Kenkel said.
“We play a physical brand of
lacrosse, and we got penalized
for it in the Vanderbilt game.
They scored four goals when
we were a man short.”

Along with being shorthand-
ed for over a fourth of the
Vanderbilt game, the usually
potent Panthers’ offense
couldn’t find the net.

, “We outplayed them, and we
outshot them,” Neft said. “We
just couldn’t score. They had a
real good goalie, but we usual-

ly score anyway.”

The Panthers had little trou-
ble scoring in their first two
games. They opened with a 12-
1 win over the St. Louis
Lacrosse Club and then beat
Bowling Green 11-3.

But lopsided wins and a
third-place finish aren’t enough
to satisfy these Panthers.

‘‘We’ve got a lot of work to
do before spring,” captain Luke
Fox said. “But the fall season is

. developmental, and we didn’t

have all of our guys down
there.”

Pitt starters John Foris and
Chad Lahman were both out
with injuries, and starter Ed

Croot didn’t make the trip
because of a prior ROTC com-
mitment, forcing the Panthers
to go with inexperienced rook-
ies.

“The freshmen don’t under-
stand collegiate lacrosse yet,”
Fox said.

“The game has a different
tempo than the high school
game.

One Pitt rookie who didn’t
have a problem adjusting to his
first collegiate action was Mark
Polecritti. He finished the tour-
nament with five goals, second
on the team to two-time
Panther scoring leader Josh
Gochnauer, who had nine

goals.

“I just went out and gave 100
percent,” Polecritti said.

“Ed [Croot] wasn’t there, and
Mark stepped up and gave me
good support up front,”
Gochnauer said. “He’s not up
to Croot’s level yet, but he’s
improving.”

And while they didn’t come
away with the tournament
championship, the Panthers
were able to reassure them-
selves that this year’s club is
capable of past accomplish-
ments.

“Our defense is still real
solid,” Neft said. “It can carry
us."

Continued from page 5
Punting 15 times over the

past two games, Cochran is

averaging a steady 43 yards

per punt. He also boomed a

52-yard kick against the Irish

that showcased his young,
strong leg.

A leg that wasn’t supposed
to punt this year.

“Everything I heard was I’ll
be redshirted," Cochran said
of what he was told at the
beginning of the season. “The
first game Kevin [Leon] had a
great. game, then the groin
injury started to bother him.

“After the third game, the

coaches told me to ‘step it up’
if Iwanted to play,” Cochran
added.

“And I was told a week
before‘ our fourth game that I
would be the starter.”

What a transition. From red-
shirt back-up to starting
punter in a matter of weeks is
very unusual. But the unusual
has usually turned into the
typical for the 1995 Pitt foot-
ball team.

Another “typical” Pitt expe-
rience has blossomed in rook-
ie Denorse Mosley.

Mosley, who has shared
time with the injured Dietrich

Jells and Jay Jones on kickoff
returns, is averaging a
sparkling 28.3 yards per
return. He also seen some
playing time as a punt return-
er.

Mosley, another likely red-
shirt candidate as the season
began, has played on the
defensive side of the ball, too.
He has 13 tackles (10 solo
and three assists) and has
been in every Panther game
this season.

Throw in rookie placekick—
er Steve Kalmanides and his

strong effort as Pitt’s starting ~

kicker, and the “kids,” who

would probably be confined
to the redshirt sidelines, are
now quickly becoming regu-
lars. .

So a question arises. How
will these “kids” affect next
years recruiting class?

“We need to recruit in
every position,” Majors said.
“We’ll try to get at least one
good football player at each
position. Even though it usu-
ally doesn’t work that way,
we will try to do it.”

So the “kids” won’t affect
Majors recruiting effort next
season at all. They will just be
a year older.

Buncher—

holding a previously
respectable San Diego running
game to a pathetic total of 19
yards on 20 carries.

The Steelers have the kind of
defense that champions are
made of. In a year that the field
goal is king, they have one of
the best in Gary Anderson.

‘Weak competition in the con-
ference could make the Steelers
the class of the AFC. This
Sunday could provide an indi-
cation of what they could do
there as the Saints come march
 no, that one is too easy.
