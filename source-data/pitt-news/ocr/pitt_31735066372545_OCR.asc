Dr. Richard Thom, a Pitt eco-

minus in the area of economy. He
said that Reagan has not done any-
thing substantial yet to improve

the nation’s economy. He has,

slowed down the inflation rate and
reduced taxes, but Thorn said he
doesn’t think those two acts will
help the economy to any great
degree. _ P’

“I think the Reagan administra-

Dr. Dave Houston, a Pitt econo-

Reagan “no credit” on his grade

saying the administration will
have to ‘abandon its current poli-

improve. . t

“The economic progress is a very
substantial failure partly because
of poorly conceived notions,”
Houston said.

He said that even the ideas
behind the policies“ do not work
and criticized the planning behind
the budgeting process.’

“We have the largest peacetime

Johnston gives Reagan an A to A
mmus as a politician and “no bet-
ter than a C plus” as an administra-
tor.

Johnston said he senses a strong
flavor of 19505 ideology _in Ameri-

 can life today.

“Reagan believes that the Rus-
sians are behind everything had
that happens in the world,” he
said. _

While most people were whis-

pering about the new era of conser- '

vatism that would sweep the
nation with Reagan’s election,
Johnston said he does not think
that the country is turning in that
direction.

“There was a long-term realign-
ment starting with Goldwater in

1964, and I do think that people are -

more conservative now than they
were 20 years ago,” Johnston said.

Hypnosis

Moshein also said that
hypnosis was unlikely to force
any action against a person’s
natural tendencies--it would-
n’t cause one to commit a bank
robbery for instance.

“His brain is intact and his
personality is intact in hypnosis
as well as not in hypnosis,” he
commented.

In response to a question
regarding reliability of
testimony for court gleaned by
hypnosis, Moshein said that it
is “no better or no worse than

any other kind of human

testimony.” _
Hypnosis is usually

attempted when a person

cannot recall details or has
impaired memory, he added.
“Hypnosis is not a crystal
ball,” he said.
Strongly entrenched habits
can be broken through

‘hypnosis, but strong motiva-

tion is also necessary, he
pointed out.

“For a person who is fairly
highly motivated and needs a
little extra nudge, two or three
hypnotic sessions can be very,
very helpful,” Moshien said.

Is training necessary for the
use of hypnosis?

He likened such thinking to
allowing only an advanced,
experienced surgeon use of a
Band—Aid. But Moshein did
characterize hypnosis as
entertainment that can leave a
person embarrassed, humili-
ated and disturbed.

“If you use it for goals that
you are not prepared to

~.fulfill...then why did you use
it?” he asked.

Moshein has not used
hypnosis to regress individuals
to childhood and pointed out
that memories “practically
tasted" in regression may be
illusory—-the results are “bits
and pieces of truth and bits and
pieces of fiction pasted together
the way your dreams are."

In summation, he defined the
hypnotic process as “a joint
effort to achieve a mutually

avreerl upon goal."

against past circumstances.”

Perhaps the strongest reaction to
Reagan’s performance concerns
his policies towards Poland and
the martial law currently in force
there.

Bob Donnorummo
Director, Russian and
East European Studies

Bob Donnorummo, associate
director of the Russian and East
European Studies program, said
that Reagan is not handling the
situation in Poland very well.

“Every action that happens can’t
be seen as a communist plot,” he
said. “Reagan and his advisors

‘have a strong, built-in aversion to

communism.”

Donnorummo said he agrees
with the sanctions imposed against
the Polish government but does
not agree with the restrictions
against the Soviet.Union.

“Our west European Allies have
a dillerent view otdetente, and

— they’re not in support of how

Reagan is handling the
situation.”

“Reagan has to be careful on act-

ing on complicity,” he said, since v

the Soviet Union has no troops in
Poland.

Donnorummo said the sanctions
against Poland are hurting the

Poles to some degree. He said that

donations made to the Catholic
Church will get to the people and
not to the government or the mil-
itary, unlike the grain the U.S.
government would send.

“Our West European allies have

gan is handling the situation,”
Donnorummo said.

Kaz F rieske

Dr. Kaz Freizke, of the Russian

gram, said that the sanctions
against Poland and the Soviet
Union are useful.

“In the short range, it may hurt
the people (of Poland) but in the
long range, it might be reason-
able,” he said.

Many of the professors contacted
by The Pitt_News did notiwant to

ston, Reagan set his own trap

[because of his fiasco: Supply

Side Economics.

“Reagan will probably have
to alter his economic course to
sidestep that trap,” he said.

Johnston also said Reagan’s
style is greatly different from
that of his predecessor, Jimmy
Carter.

“This is largely due to his
flexibility and low-key attitude
regarding crisis,” Johnston
said. ,

Johnston believes that
because Carter was unyielding
and very uptight during times
of crisis, it lead to his downfall.

Although things are going
smoothly for Reagan now,
Johnston said he thinks there
were some unsettling indica-
tions that the president may
face some problems in the
future.

According to him, Reagan
has been unwilling to
backdown on his tax cut plan,
and has been blaming recession
on Carter.

“This may erode his support
and harm his image as a
leader,” Johnston said.

Johnston also pointed out
that some of Reagan’s aides no
longer support the supply side
economic theory, and that the
problem with this theory is that
the high budget deficit will
yield higher interest rates.
These higher interest rates hurt
individuals and small business,
mostly. High interest rates also

hinder investment by big
business.
He also stated that the

recession may be difficult to
stop, and that the lowering of
the inflation rate causes a
mostly minimal effect.

“This seems to reflect a common

society is only integrated on two
levels—the most fundamental and
most organized. Otherwise, Polish
society is very dis-integrated. ‘The
political implications of this
relative dis-integration is that one
cannot speak of having attitudes
that result in leading a political
force. 3‘ ;

Frieske says that the Church and
the Solidarity Union have become
prisoners of their own ideologies
rather than being integrating
forces.

Frieske, speaking concerning an

"historical perspective of Polish
people, opposed, the American
notion that Poles are oriented
toward the future. i

Joyce’s works—Dublz'ners. A
Portra.2't of the Artist as a Young
Man, Ulysses and Fmnegans
Wake——are increasingly recognized
as a landmark in the history of
world literature, according to Pitt
Irish historian Hugh Kearney.

“As a great lover of music (Verdi
was his favorite), Joyce also

— believed he could learn from the

great masters of opera,” said
Kearney. “He felt that such
composgrs as Mozart, Wagner and
Puccini had created great works of

art possessing the universality to '

which he himself aspired.”

According to Frieske, the Polish
people have learned how to protect
their identity rather than adapting
to social and political change. In
this way they are a very
conservative society.

Frieske claims that one cannot
explain Polish society without
reference to the past, and that there
are no significant differences in
value structures and morals of the
old and the young.

According to lfrieske the
situation in Poland is much the
same as it was after World War II.
He contends’ that the situation in
Poland today is the productiof a

I Moreviews  

 Than Glew’s

For Dr.Robert Glew, the medical school professor
P who has known for some time that the pen is
mightier than the scalpel, there is no limit to the .
criticism that can be heaped uponPitt’s School of
Medicine. . .

In the meantime, however, there seems to be only
one -voice coming from the medical school. This
shouldn’t be the case.

Glew’s long and detailed letters decrying the ,
financialstraits of Pitt’s Med School have taken up
space on these pages for some time, and probably
will continue to do so for as long as he staysat Pitt.
Or at least until his typewriter ribbon snaps.--~

He has put his neck out every time he attacks the
medical school’s policy, particularly at the
university where criticism of higher-ups_ tends to*
make one’s occupational status tenuous, at best.

“They won’t fire me because they know I’m
always right,” Glew once said.

He has criticized the medical school’; massive
debt, he has argued against skyrocketing tuitions, he
has attacked Dean Donald Leon, and has led a one-
irian attack against the school’s clinical practice
p ans. -

; Despite all of Glew’s arguments for disclosure of
the practice plans, they continue to. be his nemeses.

“It is imperative that we learn more about these
practiceplans,” Glew wrote in ‘a letter Wednesday.

‘ And if we don't, be continued, Pitt’s medical school

\ is certain to die.

While Glew may be making something of a

‘ doomsday predication, he does seem‘ to make an

important point that warrants additional

consideration: Where exactly did the $27.2 million

in practice plans generated this year go? Who or
what benefited from the money?

With that ‘kind of money, theimedical school

. could: pay off its current debt of $2.8 million and

0 have enough money left over to stay out of the red for
the next decade. 0 .

- Unfortunately, the subject of the practice plans is
too complicated an issue to be described here. For
that matter, so is much of the internal operation of
the medical school".

The medical school and its practice plans might
be a little easier to discuss, however, if some
additional faculty besides the prolific Glew came out
in the open and -gave their sides to: the story. It’s
probably the faculty members who are complaining
the most about biased medical school reporting who
are doing the least to correct the situation.

So until someone else gets up enough courage to
make a public statement for or against the medical
school’s policies, Glew will probably be the only
voice we hear from inside Scaife-Hall.

What Does.-if

By TIM KEARNEY‘

In a recent press conference, U.S.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig
refused to field a question from a
British reporter. Haig exploded in
anger when asked if it wasn’t
incongruous for him to support
military regimes, such as the Tur-
kish military dictatorship (a
NATO member), while deriding

the Polish leadership. The Secre-

tary went into a tirade about the
press’ double standard. He said he
couldn't understand how the press
could ask such a question, and it

‘should be talking up the West— .i

not deriding it with ‘such
questions. ' ‘ A 7

I wish that Haig had answered
the question. When the Polish mil-
itary grabbed power, Haig was in
Brussels at a meeting of the NATO
leaders, and he expressed his out-
rage. Personally, I couldn't help
but accept his words with cyni-

‘ cism. NATO, a group which is to

protect western democracy as we
know it, has within its ranks a mil-

  

 

‘itary dictatorship that can be as

repressive as any totalitarian "state
that Haig chooses to berate. Of
course Haig can't understand the
question: if he understood it, he
would have to answer it.

Perhaps the press has a bias.
That is up to the tastes of’ the read-
ership. But if I understand Haig’s
reaction and comments, he would
have the press turn a deaf ear and a

 ig Want?  

blind eye to the obvious improprie- E
ties and contradictions between
what we say and do. What exactly
does Haig want? If he could sup-
port military regimes within his
own camp, why bother to make
such a fuss about Poland? 1
Granted, the reporter asked a
loaded question. The answer was
obvious: the Polish situation fit
into Haig and the administraiioifs '
ideological arena and lends itself to
make hay with propaganda. H5w-

ever, the audacity to suggest that P’
 the press has a double standard is

beyond belief. What shall the press 0
do—look only for ways to vilify the ‘
enemy and promote -ourselves in
print? This is the role of the media M
in the Soviet Union. The,only way
to ‘differentiate ourselves from the
Russians is to prove to the world
that there is a difference between

E the two countries. The distinction 
doesn’t seem to be forthcoming.‘It’s L

a shame. We have so much more to
offer than empty platitudes.

‘TaIkingTeeth {Needs Fillings

Dear Editor: I
This letter is written in response

_ to the article, “Pitt Student Invents

‘Talking Teeth’ ” that appeared in
your Jan. ~13 edition. I have
nothing but praise for Joseph Res-
nick, for he has certainly used his
engineering talents quite innova-
tively to. attack the biomedical
problem presented. The problem is
that Pitt News reporter Margaret
Attwood 'was also quite
innovative—albeit- in a different
matirier——in writing the story.

For starters, the presenting dis-
order was entitled “Laryngocaroe-
noma” throughout the article, an
obvious substitution for the true
title “laryngocarcinoma." More
seriously, laryngectomized
patients do not communicate via
estomer (sic) or use diaphramal
(sic) speech. They all must breathe
through a stoma (the hole in the
throat) since the airway must be
directed out through this hole in
the absence of the larynx. Those
who can, learn to speak using eso-
phageal speech, in which a modi-
fied belch provides the new voice
source. This can be done because
the passageway is still open from
the esophagus to the mouth.

Furthermore, she writes of the
$300-$800 cost (really $100 and up)
of  . .the hand-held devices that
require surgery to install." If these
devices are hand-held (which is
true), why would surgery be
required? To suture the device to
the patient’s hand?

Finally‘, the claim that speech
pathologists have never done this
research is unsubstantiated. Physi-

cians, tientists, biomedical engi-

neers and speech pathologists
throughout the world are working
in concert to develop new devices
and techniques, both surgical and
rehabilitative, to improve the com-
munication of this type of patient.

' Again, I take nothing away from

Mr_. Resnick. He does seem to be a
creative genius who has developed

a valuable tool to help the laryn-'

gectomee. It is ‘The Pitt _I_Vews that ~
has not done its homework.

Health Service Budget
Statements Incorrect  

Dear Editor:
Upon reading the article about
the student health fee that

appeared in the Jan. 18 edition of

The Pitt News “Students Discuss
SHS”, we, as members of the Stu-
dent Health Advisory Board, are

committed to respond to state-‘

ments made concerning the budge-
tary policy of the Student Health
Service. The general budget break-
Jown outlined in the article was
only partially correct. _

The SHS is a labor-intensive
facility and consequently 70 per-
cent of the budget- is allocated for
staff salaries. The remainder of the
budget is divided among contrac-
tual services, e.g. lab work and x-
rays. .

Franklin Carter, director of SHS,
also pointed out another major
expenditure discrepancy men-
tioned in the article. It was incor-
rectly stated “approximately 23
percent of all student health fees"
are used for employee fringe

benefits. Actually, 23.5 percent of ’

employee salaries go for fringe
benefits. Acording to Carter, this
figure for fringe benefits is
appropriated into every university
ment budget. He continued by
stating that this expenditure is
mandated by law or by action of the
board of trustees and is not subject .
to change at the discretion of the
department head. Therefore,‘ the
suggestion offered by Robbie The’
concerning reallocation of this per-'
centage cannot materialize.
As members of this campus organi-
zation, serving as a liaison between
students and the Student Health
Center, the Student Health Advi-
sory Board will continue to moni-
tor the policies of the health center
to meet the needs of all university
students. _

 Senior Darrelli Gissendaniier rocketed off thebencht to

‘contribute 13 points Wednesday as Pitt ended a four-game
 skid with a convincing win over St. Bonaventure.

Roth photo

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Was it the blistering pre-game
talk by Coach Roy Chipman, was it
the change in the lineup or was it
the endless team discussions that
enabled the Pitt Panther basketball
team to break a four-gaine losing
streak Wednesday with a
ridiculously easy 86-56 rout of St.
Bonaventure?

Or was it just that St.
Bonaventure, usually no patsy, left
its team back in Olean, N.Y. and
brought what losing Coach Jim
Satalin would later describe as “a
bad grammar school team” to‘ the
Pitt Field House.

W-hatever thereason, the win
was the perfect prescription for a
Panther team that had begun to
question its own ability and a
coach who was questioning his
sanity.

“We really need this game.
We’ve been talking to our kids a
lot, telling them not to hang their
heads,” Chipman said, then added
smiling, “I needed thisone for my
health and my sanity too.” ’

.The win kept the Panthers from
falling into the Eastern 8 cellar and
was the debut of a lineup that
Chipman felt was finally, after a
plethora of changes, the right one.

Chipman inserted two freshmen,
center Andre Williams and guard
George Allen, into the lineup and
utilized Roosevelt Kirby in the
middlelof the 2-3 zone‘. The second-
year coach looked like a genius as,
from‘ the opening tap, the new
Panther quintet outmuscled,
outhustled and severely outplayed
the slower Bonnies.

Even the score, as
lamented after the game, was not
an indication of how truly
dominant Pitt was.

One of the reasons for Pitt’s
domination was the play of senior
Darrell Gissendanner and
Williams. Gissendanner, benched
at the start in favor of Allen’, made

Clripman look like a prophet when -

he came off the bench to score 13

Money Not the On|yReason snemn Left  

I current

i/By JOHNETTE HOWARD

While Jackie Sherrill’s decision
to aceept a record $1.7 million pact
to serve as football coach and

» athletic director at Texas A&M was

made with a great reverence for the
almighty dollar, the newfound
autonomy he gained by bolting

Pitt also figured in the ex-Panther‘

coach’s-decision.

While speculation suggesting
Sherrill was nudged out of Pitt
seems unfounded—the words and

Jmore importantly, the actions of

Pitt adiriinistratipn in the days
before Sherrill’s departure suggest
otherwise—it is evident an under-
of frustration, perhaps
even resenment, eased Sherrill’s
mind in his decision to head South.

The conflict is clear: Sherrill, by

I going to Texas A&M, gained not

only the lifetime security a couple
million dollars can bring, but also
the freedom over his football pro-
gram that be actively sought, but
did not satisfactorily receive at Pitt.
And, perhaps more importantly,
autonomy he harbored no hope of
ever receiving. .

‘As several top administrators,

notably Chancellor Wesley Posvar,’

have said, “No one man is bigger
than this university.” While Sher-
rill apparently never bluntly asked
for outright’ control of his pro-

'gram, it was no secret by his

attempts to erode the administra-
tion‘ grip over such things as sche-
duling, equipment ordering and
financial accountability that he
desired, freedom, and thought his
achievements‘ merited them.

Any attempt to understand the
importance of. 

  

s . freedom to-1‘ s 

Sherrill, a highly-principled and
proud man who rose from a hum-
ble dirt—farin Oklahoma town to
the height of his profession, is a
task that necessarily involves an
examination of the man’s values,
and a healthy dose of speculation,

given Sherrill’s inavailability the

past two days—he was out
recruiting—-in the aftermath of the
coach’s leave.

After six seasons of unabashed
success in which he posted a 50-9-l

vmark, including a 33-3 record the

last three years and a near-miss
national championship team,
Sherrill still felt he did not get the
appreciation he deserved at Pitt,
nor the ” power he wanted to
continue——power the rabid Texas
A8cM football sycophants gladly
surrendered. . I

What did Sherrill want? “Hejust
didn’t want anyone else touching
his football program," says a high-
placed Pitt athletic official. “Those
stories about the watches, the sand-
wiches are all petty things.‘That’s
garbage——that wasn’t part of it. It
was all ego.”

Maybe. Maybe it was petty for
Sherrill to berate Pitt Assistant
Athletic Director Walt Cummings
for distributing Sugar" Bowl
watches to coaches first, and not
the team’s student managers first,
as Sherrill intended. Sherrill was
also reportedly fuming over Pitt
Assistant Chancellor Ed Bozik’s

,orders to open tip the Panther

locker room before Sherrill felt he
had enough time to talk to his team
after this year's stunning Sugar
Bowl win.

Iherc. was ..a.1so .S_heniilt's anger -.

‘with

after Pitt refused to pay a $400 bill
for sandwiches he ordered for the
players while trainingi at Biloxi,
Miss. prior to the Sugar Bowl. Pitt
rightly maintained that by footing
the bill the university would vio-
late NCAA rules since the players
had already been given meal
money for that day. ‘But to Sherrill,
already frustrated with the bureau-
cratic channels the football pro-
gram had to go through for
purchasing, Pitt's refusal to pick
up the tab was a slight.

Sherrill also resented the univer-
sity officials who exhorted him to
fire first-year ‘assistant George
Pugh after it was discovered that
Pugh had scalped Sugar Bowl
tickets. Sherrill, in a battle, pre-
vailed and Pugh was suspended for
one—month without pay.

There were other concessions
Sherrill wanted-—“fiscal and "pro-
cedural problems,” according to
Dean Billick, Pitt associate athletic
director—and the university was
ready to meet most of those
demands to Sherrill’s satisfaction,
according to Athletic Director Cas
Myslinski. The problem included
Sherrill’s desire for greater control
over scheduling, travel arrange-
ments and purchasing within the
football program.

“He already had complete con-
trol of the football program and
was answerable only to the athletic
director. The things he discussed
the administration were
minor things. Anything he asked
for, he got, within reason,” Billick
said.

What Sherrill didn’t get was

.complete ,autonomt?:.and.{,answera-. 1

-bility only to the charicellor’s
office. While Pitt was planning to
give Sherrill the new title of asso-
ciate athletic director for football,
both Myslinski and Billick-admit-
ted the title would have been more
an acknowledgment of Sherrill’s
accountability only to the athletic
director’s office, and not a boost in
his power or change in duties.

In his final press conference
here, after he had announced his,
resignation, Sherrill repeatedly
stressed the complete authority he
would have over the program at
A8cM, where he is answerable only
to the president.

“It came down to how important
athletics are to a university—and

/they are very, very important (at

Texas A_8cM), ” Sherrill said. “They I

have more loyalty, more allegiance
to the school than anybody here
can visualize.”

At the same press conference,
Sherrill made several unspecific
references to the “frustrations” and
“struggles” he had here at Pitt.
Commenting on the rebuilding
task‘ ahead of him at A&M, Sherrill
said, ‘‘I know it’s not going to be an
easy job. I know how hard I had to
work here, and how difficult it was
to put the program in this
position.”

Considering Sherrill inherited a
well-established program and a
team coming off a national cham-
pionship, the above statement
sheds some important light on
Sherrill’s view of his treatment by
the Pitt administration. Some team

observers have admitted Sherrill

would have preferred to not have to

deal with the eadmi-nistratioiiat. all. I
V . ~r , ,. « 7

, I

except for the chancellor's office.

“I think he would have loved to
have been athletic director if he had
the chance to do that,” says a source
close to the Pitt team. .

As Sherrill stressed at the press
conference, at A8cl\/I he will be
answerable only to the president.
Otherwise, he said, “I'm not owned
and I never will be.” 

So, apparently, Sherrill got the
control he wanted at Texas A&M,
and Pitt kept the control over its
football program, the way they
wanted. Still, there is the lingering
doubt that, had Sherrill gotten the
respect and power he thought he
rightly deserved and wrongly
lacked, he might still be at Pitt. As’
one of Sherrill’s confidantes said,
“If not for that, I think he might
have stayed. It wasn’t just the
money.” 1

In the highly emotional after-
math of Pitt's last-minute Sugar
Bowl win over Georgia, shortly ,
before Bozik succeeded in opening
the locker room to the host of well-
wishers and boosters outside, Sher-
rill’did get one brief moment with
the team——a moment that, for all its
raw intensity and outpouring of
feeling, may best indicate Sherrill’s
opinion of the powers above and
around him.

“I don't want anyone else in this
room,” Sherrill said sternly from
atop a table in the rear of the locker
room. "I'm tired of everyonejump—
ing on the bandwagon. This is our
victory. This is ours.”

T_hat, more than anything,
explains why Jackie Sherrill is now

Gymnastics a Labor
 Love for Martino

By BRIAN BALK

For Pitt senior,Holly Martino,
gymnastics is not just any activity
which she chooses to repeatedly
engage in. Rather, gymnastics has

been an overwhelming influence.

that has molded her lifestyle since
she‘ was a child.

Like most gymnasts, Martino is
highly disciplined and dedicated to
the sport—-perhaps even addicted.

g»Despite several obstacles, she's

never quit striving to continue
competing.

Martino entered the gymnast’s
world at the young age of 10 at the
McKeesport Turners Club. There
she learned the rudiments of. the
sport, but more importantly; she
learned the meaning of the words
dedication and discipline.

“My very first coach pounded me
with discipline and really taught
me what dedication meant. I guess
I carried these teachings over to the
way I presently train,” Martino
said.

For the potential young star,
gymnastics soon became second

. nature. She modestly admits, “I
FV;,.}.-eally never went through an inter-

mediate stage. For me, it was from
beginners right to the advanced
level.”

Martino continued her excel-
lence in high school by qualifying
for the Pennsylvania State Cham-
pionships her freshman year, and
winning the district meet her
sophomore year. When McKees-
port High School terminated its

gymnastics program after Marti-I

no’s sophomore year, she con-
tinued to train on a competitive
club level.

Today Martino’s honors and
awards are numerous. For exam-
ple: she was named an All-East

 both her freshman and sophomore
3*‘ /.\}*ears at Pitt. She also was named

M.V.P. of the Lady Panther team
her first two seasons. Martino was
ranked 20th nationally in the all-
around her freshman year, and is
currently the captain of the Lady
Panther squad. As the .list of her
achievements stretches on, it is
obvious that winning and excel-
ling are Martino’s strong points.

Ironically, Martino might never
have achieved her gymnastics suc-
cess. After she had a bad fall, her
doctor told her “You may never
compete again.”

While working out on the
uneven bars during last year’s
Christmas break, Martino slipped
and went crashing to the floor,

..,.§mding on her head. She suffered a

broken sternum from the fall, and
was expected to be out all season, if
not for her entire career. This
injury was emotionally and physi-
cally traumatic, for it meant the
probable end to a major part of her
life.

iMartino still can not determine
whether it was her love for the
sport, undying determination, or

.._» . V V , a , » . . , . V ..
2..--. s . _ . _ . , » 1 '

worry about retaining her scholar-
ship which restored her to full
health. “Within two weeks, I was
up in the gym doing almost every-
thing,” said Martino. In fact, Mar-
tino recovered so quickly that she
was able to compete in the majority
of the team’s meets last year. .

During a meet situation, Marti-
no’s behavior resembles a hypnotic
state. It seems that she is immersed
in a world of her own as she con-
centrates on her performance.

“I rarely talk to.anyone-—even
my parents—during a competi-
tion,” said Martino.

The endless hours of practice
time are essential for a gymnast,
Martino explained.

“By practicing my skills over
and over again, my routine
becomes like a natural set of
reflexes while competing,” said
Martino: By having fully mastered
the major skills, Martino is free to
concentrate on the “little things”
that give her routines that extra
spark of amplitude.

Martino’s favorite event is the
floor exercise. It’s a crowd pleaser,
too. It is obvious by the continual
smile on her face that she is enjoy-
ing every second of her routine.

“Being expressionistic on floor
exercises is extremely important
because it gives the impression that
it is easy, that everyone could do
it,” Martino said.

Martino’s fondness for the floor
exercise was probably prompted by
her first love, dancing. “I always
wanted to be a dancer. Whenever
there is a movie with dancing on
TV you can’t tear me away from
it,” said Martino. Her favorites:
Ginger Rodgers and Fred Astaire.
She even has aspirations to some-
day be a member of a dance
company. ’

Martino explains that the prob-
lem with today’s young, exciting
gymnasts is just that, they try to be
too exciting. “The small superstars
will throw those crazy, phenome-
nol tricks, but theylack the finesse

of a well-composed routine,”

Martino said.

For Martino’s last 11 years, the
only other activity that took up
more time than gymnastics was

sleep. With eight-hour workouts.

each day while in high school and
entire summers spent in various
gymnastics camps, it is under-
standable why she considers
gymnastics to be a important part
of her life. She admits that living a
life that revolves around
gymnastics has its downfalls, but
she adds, that it has its benefits too.

“Through gymnastics I know
more people around the world
than I do in my home town,” Mar-
tino said.

Martino, a psychology major, is
planning to attend Pitt’s Graduate
School of Business next fall. She

-said she will have “mixed emo-

tions” about leaving the sport; she
will be relieved when all the hard
work is over, but added she will
always miss her avidity for
competition.

Whether Martino is an adminis-
trator for a corporation, or dancing
up a storm at Radio City, she will
always have a warm spot in her
heart for the sport she loves most,
gymnastics.

The Pitt Lady Panthers gymnas-
tics team, its depth still depleted by
injuries, travels to face a strong
Michigan team tomorrow.

With leading scorer and All-
America Lisa Shirk out for at least
two more weeks and Gretchen
Speich still bothered by injuries to
both ankles, the team will be striv-
ing more than usual to minimize
its mistakes and hit ‘routines.

The team is coming off a weak
performance at Maryland, which
defeated Pitt by a whopping nine-

point margin. Lady Panther Coach ”

Donna Sanf t said her gymnasts are
intent on “redeeming themselves,”
tomorrow for the Maryland meet.

“We had a lot of breaks at Mary-
land. It was a bad meet, but then

that doesn’t happen very often to .

us,” Sanft said. “We’re doing the
best we can_not to make excuses
and the team has a good attitude. I
still think we'll have a strong team
by the middle of the season, and
our goal is still to win the Eastern
Regionals.” ‘

Michigan, which has been scor-
ing in the mid-l30’s range, boasts
five solid all-around performers,
according to Sanft, but the team’s
overall scoring has been erratic.
Because Pitt is traveling out of its
Eastern region, Sanft said her
team’s scoring becomes harder
than usual to predict.

‘l'omorrow’s meet is the second
in a five-match gantlet the Lady
Panthers must endure on the road.

Tiger Paul in Limbo

By SCOTT DELLETT

The saga of “Tiger” Paul
Auslander and his conflict with
the Pitt-~ administration
continues. With Auslander
conspicuously absent, the Pitt
cheerleaders made their first
appearance ‘—meeting with
mixed reactions—since Tiger
Paul was banned from cheering
on the floor before the
Panthers-Duquesne game.

Today, Auslander says he
will meet with Associate
Athletic Director Dean Billick
to discuss possible solutions to
this situation.

“If I came back now without
getting a better deal, I would
look like a fool, ” Auslander
“It’s a matter of

"A better deal, according to
Auslander, is not an increase to
the $50 he was being paid for
cheering by a member of the
Golden Panthers. Rather, he
would like a position with the
university.

“I started cheerleading not
only because I enjoy to, but also
I wanted to earn some money
through commercials,” said
Auslander. “It hasn't worked
out, and I am frustrated because
of that. I’m addicted to
cheerleading.”

Some of that frustration may
be attributed to his financial
status. Auslander earns about
$5000 over the winter at various
jobs, but this money usually
doesn’t last over the summer
months. Auslander used to
work as a vendor at Three
Rivers Stadium, but as he said,
“It isn't safe to ride home on the
bus at night.” .

Auslander is waitingfor the
Pitt administration to make a
decision. He says, “The ball is
in their court." .

Billick would not reveal what
he planned to discuss over
lunch with Auslander. Rather,
Billick said he hopes tov“sit
down and discuss our thoughts
and position.

“This is a very sensitive issue,
although minor,” Billick said.
“The main issue is our support.
for the basketball program.

“We supported the Pitt
cheerleaders and will continue
to do so. We hope the students-
will support the other
students." This may be .the
main problem Billick and
cheerleading coach Karen
Agostinella have to solve.

Booing was ev_ident toward
the cheerleaders at Wednesday
night's game but Agostinella
believes this reaction will
subside.

“We’re still taking a lot of
swipes over the matter."
Agostinella said. “I was told the
cheerleaders would get egged
and booed last night
(Wednesday), and we prepared
mentally for that possibility.
I’m rather relieved people
didn’t take that approach.”

“We were booed, but the kids
said the faces in the crowd——the
students—were not hostile.
They were booing on a lark
almost—a few here, ‘a few
there.”

Agostinella believes that the
booing will stop as time heals
the wounds.

“There were some cheers,"

said Agostinella. “I am
confident things will get
better."

Despite Agostinella’s
optimism, healing those
wounds may be harder than she
thinks. Many fans showed their
displeasure towards the
decision Wednesday night, and
one group of students raised a
banner reading, “We only cheer
for Tiger Paul.”

Auslander appreciates the
continued support of his Pitt
fans throughout the situation.

“I thought I might have lost
the support of the Pitt
students—especially with the
rumors of my going to
Duquesne,” Auslander said.
“The students made me
popular. To me, how they feel
is all that matters. I’m glad they
still back me. I don't want to
lose their respect and
friendship.”

Perhaps Billick expressed the
best way to handle the
situation.

“We hope to handle the issue
with dignity,” Billick said.

Swimmers Face
Tough Lasalle

By SEAN BARNES

Coach Fred Lewis and his
Panther swimmers left for Phila-
delphia this morning for their Sat-
urday match-up with the Explorers
of LaSalle. LaSalle, known for its
basketball and swimming prowess,
has had a good recruiting year and
will prove a formidable opponent
in every event.

Adding to LaSalle’s already
strong returning lineup are fresh-
men who competed in the senior
national championships in the

events. In the other events, LaSalle
returns NCAA National qualifiers

and mid—distance freestyle events.
LaSalle did_ a fine job recruiting
divers. This is especially disheart-
ening for Pitt’s chances in - the
event. With the recent loss of their

For the fourth time this season,
the Pitt Lady Panther basketball
team took the floor and were out-
numbered by their opponents, 7-5.
In addition to the five Indiana
Lady basketball players, Pitt also
had to overcome the two villains in
black and white, otherwise known
as officials.

Everyone knows you can’t argue
with officials—they always get the
last word. And the last word out of
Bloomington, Indiana was “Got-
chal”

Indiana University, seeking
revenge for two previous defeats at
the hands of the Lady Panthers,
slapped Pitt in the face with a 69-59
loss. The defeat lowers Pitt’s record
to 10-6 as the Lady Panthers pre-
pare to host ninth-ranked Mary-
land Saturday night.

Indiana opened the game with a

_lay-up by Denise Jackson, but

’ Pitt’s Jennifer Bruce countered
with a three-point play to give Pitt
the early edge, 3-2. It was the only

 News,-‘_Friiday, January-'22,» I982

time Pitt lead all night. Indiana
put together five unanswered
points to go on top 7-3 just three
minutes into the game.

Pitt clawed back midway
through the half to tie the score at
15-15. In the next three minutes the
officials called four fouls on the
Lady Panthers—-two on forward
Pam Miklasevich. This sent Mik-
lasevich to the bench with three
personal fouls with barely a quar-
ter of the game gone by.

The calls also gave the Lady
Hoosiers some breathing room
again, having racked up nine
straight points, five of them on free
throws. The Lady Panthers, being
slapped periodically with personal
fouls, could not mount a counter-
attack, and Indiana went to the
locker room with a comfortable 39-
28 edge.

The Lady Hoosiers still main-
tained their ll-point margin over
Pitt halfway through the second
period. Then Bruce got things rol-
ling for the Lady Panthers with a
lay-up. Debbie Lewis followed that
with another, Gail Aughburns

swished a live-footer, and Beth
Tarasi popped one in from 15 feet
out to bring the Lady Panthers
within three, 53-50.

With seven minutes remaining
the margin was still three, 57-54. In
the next two minutes, ihe Lady
Panthers were whistled for three
personal fouls, two of which went
to Aughburns, saddling her with
four. Indiana then coasted to a 69-
59 win.

Despite the foul trouble, Augh-

burns turned in a stellar perfor‘-.,,

mance for the Lady Panthers. She
led all scorers with 19 points and
pulled down 12 rebounds, also tops
for the Lady Panthers. Bruce
canned 16 in the loss. Four of Indi-
ana’s starters ended the game in
double figures, true to their scoring
averages.

Again, the numbers show that
Pitt lost the game by sending the
Lady Hoosiers to the charity stripe
too many times. Both teams
recorded 27 field goals, but Indiana
was 15 of 23 from the foul line. Pitt
had llchances from the foul line
and made good on just five of them.

Ladies Blow by Clarion

By SCOTT DELLETT

Several swimmers qualified for
Nationals last Wednesday night at
Trees Hall as the Pitt Lady Panther
swim team won 11 of their first 12
events en route to an easy 79-68 win
over Division II champion Clarion
State College.

Pitt Coach Dave Belowich had
some set goals for his swimmers to
achieve, and once again, they
didn’t’disappoint him.

“We achieved all our goals,”
Belowich said. “We had people
making national and Eastern cuts,
worked on our speed, and got the
inexperienced swimmers to take
the main role in the events, where
they responded well._

“In general, the whole team
swam well,” Belowich added.

Jan Ujevich had another out-
standing meet, setting the Pitt
record for the 100-yard individual
medley with a time of 58.86. Uje-
vich also qualified for nationals
with wins in the 50-yard freestyle

the Maryland Terrapins.

The Lady Panthers have never
defeated a Maryland squad, but
they will attempt to break the jinx
Saturday night at Pitt Field House.
Maryland is one of six nationally
ranked teams remaining on Pitt’s
schedule. Four Lady Terrapins are

averaging in double-digits, led by _

Jasmine Perzic with 16.5 points a
game. Pitt will counter with Lewis,

Dugan, Bruce, Miklasevich and
Aughburns.

In an attempt to attract more

support for the Lady Panthers, the J

Pitt Sports Information Office has
selected Saturday’s game as Pitt

Wrestlers Travel to Ohio

By TIM DINGER

Tonight the Pitt wrestling team
begins a two-match road trip to
Ohio. Tonight’s match places the
Panthers against an experienced
Ohio State Buckeye squad.

Although Ohio State is not
ranked in the Top 20, they can
boast a 21-19 upset over top-ranked
Oklahoma, which shows the
Buckeyes’ potential as a
contending team.

Saturday the Panthers travel to
the Ashland Quad to wrestle
Ashland, Central State, and
Cincinnati. Although not as strong
as Ohio State, Ashland promises a
close, exciting match.

Then, after a two day rest, Pitt
travels back to Ohio to take on
Cleveland State.

Pitt Coach Rande Stottlemyer is
confident about this weekend's
action.” Ohio State is tough, but
they’re not as intense as Lehigh
was,” he said. Lehigh recently
stopped the Panthers 38-2.

The Panther’s shifted line-up
finds John Lis (1-0) against the
Buckeyes’ Chris Disavito at 126
pounds

At 134 pounds, Chris’ younger
cousin, Leo Disavito, takes on
Panther Joe Throckmorton (9-2),
up from 126 to replace the injured -
Craig Richey.

' In addition, Lewis’ outstanding

freshman recruits will be threats to
the Explorers may not be
expecting.

Pitt will be LaSalle’s toughest
opponent of the 1981-82 season and
should easily fill the stands with
spectators‘. “We shoud be able to
counter everything but their All-
America butterflyer and their long-
distance freestyle national list,”
said Lewis. “But even in these

events. we’ll only be a couple’

strokes behind. We’ll need 100 per-

~- cent of our team striving for their

best times. That one point for third
place may mean the difference in
the meet.”

LaSalle has a good, fast pool_
with ample lighting for diving.
Krug, who has coached an Eastern
champion diver for Pitt annually

since 1979, has had Nordheimer .

“working his butt off” and expects

a» good showing from him. Minik’s-

loss will cost the Panther team
dearly not just at LaSalle, but in
every meet remaining this season,
including the NCAA Easterns at
Pitt and the Nationals in
Milwaukee.

continued from page eight

points in only 15 minutes.
Chipman had been saying all
along that Gissendanner was better
off the bench.

Andre.Williams no longer sits on
the ‘bench. His role as starting
center on offense and forward on
defense was further reinforced by a
12-point, ll-rebound effort.
Although still plagued by a lack of
stamina, Williams, when not
“sucking air” as Ch_ipman put it,

,was effective on both the offensive

and defensive boards. Williams
had three tip-ins of missed shots.
Williams’ solid play at center
allowed Steve Beatty, a misfit at
center since arriving at Pitt, to play
to his natural forward spot.
“(There is more room of
maneuver at the forward spot. I can
see the cutters in front of me, and I

»don’t have to react as quickly,”

Beatty said. ' -
Beatty’s preference for the

forward spot was reflected in his

play. He hit ‘on two out of three

Rutgers away on Saturday.

“they can handle,” Chipman said.

Pitt Crushes Bonnied

from the field and three out of four
from the line.

“We feel forward is Steve's
natural position, and at center we
really didn’t let his talent develop,".
Chipman said of Beatty’s switch.

With a new lineup that
seemingly has everyone happy,
Chipman prepares for one of the
tougher games of the year—

“Last time we played Rutgers, I
felt we played a good game, and
Rutgers had to play their best game
of the year. I’m not saying we are
going to win the game, but if we‘
play like we can, we’ll give them all

A new lineup and a revamped
defense fresh off a 30-point win
against St. Bonaventure may make .
some coaches brim with‘
confidence, if not cockiness. Not
Chipman, for he knows Rutgers
will be no...well, St. Bonaven-
ture. »
