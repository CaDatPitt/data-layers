Syphilis Test
Deadline Set
For 5 O’ clock

700 Students Have
Taken Examinations

Today is the ﬁnal day on which
free Wassermann tests will be giv-
en to students. and faculty and ad-
ministration members.

The deadline for both men and
women students is 5 o’clock today.
Tests are taken in the Men's Stu-
dent Health services on the thirty-
fourth floor and the Women’s
Health service on the twenty-eighth
ﬂoor.

‘Approximately 700 students ltad
been tested up to Wednesday aft-
ernoon. The total number is ex-
pected to go over the 1,000 mark.
Only" Test Known

The -Wasserman-n tests being
offered free through the sponsor-
ship of the Pitt News, and with
the cooperation of the health serv-
ices, and the Pittsburgh Syphilis
Control Program, are the only
method. of ﬁnding out whether the
disease has been_ contracted.

Each test takes only a few min-
ptes to complete. The student
merely submits to the blood extrac-
tion: the blood is then taken to the
City, health laboratories, where it
is tested. Reports are available for
the students a. week or ten days
after the tests are taken.

The blood tests this‘ year have
been administered :by Dr. H. C.
Carlson, director of the Men’s Stu-
dent Health service, and his assist-
ant, Dr. H. A. Bolton, and Dr. A.u-
leene‘ M. Jamison, director of the
Women’s Student Health service.

Neither the Health Services nor
the City laboratories will reveal
any percentage of ratio ﬁgures.
Results of the tests are entirely
conﬁdential.

Fourth Campaign

This final day marks the close of
the fourth annual anti-syphilis
campaign begun in 1937 by the
Pitt. News as part of a nation-wide
collegiate‘program.‘ This 1937 cam-
paign tested over 2,600 students
and faculty members.

Dr.) Millard C. Hanson, director
of the Pittsburgh Syphilis Control
Program, a City sponsored agency,
has given the full cooperation of

his department to the program, and
"made

available the laboratories
of the City to the program.

Both Dr. Carlson and Dr. Jaini-
son pointed out the educational as-
poet of the campaign as being the
most. important, for the number of
pos_i_tive reactions each year, indi-
.[cating syphilis, is negligible.

Cop & Groun Ilrama: The Engineers’ Jallop
Almost Backfires into a ’Fined’ Time

Pitt dances have, in the past,
produced some awfully weird fig-
ures (ﬁnancially speaking) but it
took the engineers to almost run
their dance in the hole before it
was held.

It seems that the engineers are
having a. Jallopy dance, come May
2, and in anticipation of the happy
event the boys were rattling around
the campus in their tjallopy to
show what some lucky fellow would
win if he went to the dance. The
jallopy, central ﬁgure in our drama.
is the door prize. _

A cop. a.nti—s_ocial no doubt, de-
cided that if he couldn't go to the
dance, neither could the jallopy.
So he ups to driver Paul Papanek
and says, “what is this you laugh-

course was, “Why this, as you can

Contest Enters
Semi-Finals

Semi-ﬁnals of the annual public
speaking contest, preliminaries of
which are now going on in speech
classes, will take place this aft-
ernoon at 2:30 o'clock in 251 Ca-
thedral.

Although two members will be
selected to represent each speech
class in the semi-ﬁnals, any student
in the University may enter in the
semi-ﬁnal contest whether he is
enrolled in a speech class or not.
The only qualiﬁcation is that he
deliver an eight to ten minute talk.

Judges in the preliminary con-
test will be faculty members of the
speech department who will select
ﬁve to seven representatives for the
final contest on April 30. Judges
in the ﬁnal contest will be mem-
bers of the University faculty other
than the speech department.

Two prizes of $10 and $5 will be
awarded to the winner and runner-
up. Last year’s contest was won by
Fred Robie, C41. Leiona'i'd“Cohen,
C42, placed second.

The tete-a-tete continued, and
during the course of the conversa-
tion, the cop‘ punctuated his re-
marks by (1) promising jail to the

With the help of . Bus Ad stu-

motion, not locomotion, and that it
wouldn't happen again.

Omar C. Held Returns to N aivy  

To Continue Personnel Work

.3)’ GEORGIA SHUSET

A man who at some time or an-
other has interviewed in his office
every student in the College, who
has served as personal adviser and
friend rather than a remote person-
ality glimpsed occasionally in an
elevator, has been notiﬁed by the
Navy department to report for ac-
tive service.

Dr. Omar C. Held, personnel as-
sistant to the Dean of the College
for 13 years, will report to the
Naval Training Station at Norfolk,
Va., ‘before May 15 to do personnel
work similar to his activities at the
University.

Varied Duties A

Dr_. Held’-s, duties at Pitt consist-
ed of teaching one class in general
psychology and having complete
charge of freshman men’s orienta-
tion courses. _

He also had the responsibility of
giving the psychological examina-
tion to freshmen, as well as the
foreign language and mathematics
placement tests.

Dr. Held has written numerous
articles for publication in educa-
tional magazines, one of the more
recent ones being a feature which
attracted widespread attention. and
was entitled “The Inﬂuence of
Month of Birth on the Intelligence
of College Freshmen.”

The former faculty member re-
ceived his A. B. degree from In-
November,
1923, his M. A. degree from the
same institution in June, 1924, and
his Ph. D. from the University in
1931. His ﬁelds of study were
psychology and education.

He was a sailor in the U. S. Navy
from 1918 to 1919.

Crawford Comments

The congenial personnel direc-
tor’s membership in professional
organizations include the American
Psychological association, Sigma Xi,
the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, the Penn-
sylvania Association of Clinical
Psychologists, the Eastern Associa-
tion of Deans and Advisers of Men,
and the American Association of
Applied Psychologists.

Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, dean of
the College, stated: “We are sure
that Dr. Held will be equally de-
voted to the interests of the men
in naval aviation for whom he will
be doing much the same kind of
work that he has done so well here.

The cop took another look at the
iallom’. and decided that if it did
happen again, viz: if he did see the
car rolling’ on the streets again, the
boys would probably be pushing it;
and that to ﬁne the boys would be
adding insult to the injury. So he
tore up the tickets.

The ﬁnale to this, one of 1il‘e’s 1

little dramas, ﬁnds the boys limp-
ing home ,and_ the cop going mer-
rily away, happy in the thought
that tomorrow is another day, the
baseball season is on, and win.
lose, or rain, Pitt cars could still
be tagged for illegal parking.

So, next. Friday's dance does not
owe $55, if the Bus Ad man is cor-
rect; the Oakland station will never
replace State Hall; and one cop
can count on never being tapped
to Sigma Tau. ‘

Pitt Thinclads
At PennRelays

Heel; Countr_v’s Best ,
At Philadelphia ﬂeet

At famed Franklin ﬁeld today and
tomorrow, 13 Pitt track and ﬁeld
performers seek to uphold the great
tradition past Panther squads have
established during the colorful 47-
year history of the Pennsylvania
relay carnival in Philadelphia.

The number 13 carries a some-
what ominous connotation to the
Panther track squad, for injuries
and hard luck have continually be-
set coach Carl Olson’s squad this
spring. The prospect of matching
feats of past Pitt teams looks fore-
boding with the nati_onally-promi-
nent Hap Stickel on the sidelines
with an injured leg, and Larry Tre-
goning and Bud Graf not in the best
of shape. A last, minute addition
to the casualty list is Red Jessup, a
member of the crack junior pole-
vaulting duo. . '

.This,a"’tei'n-oon, about 2 o'clock,
Bullet Bill Carter walks over to
starter Johnny Mcflugh and draws
a capsule from the hand of the red-
capped official. He then goes over
to teammates Larry Tregoning, Bud
Graf, and Regis Larkin to take
them to the lane he has drawn.

When McHugh raises his pistol,
Tregoning crouches on the starting
line, and the defense of‘ the Penn
Relays 440-yard title ison. Pitt
stands an outside chance of winning
this event, its third straight 440-
yard title, but Stickel’s well-built
frame is very conspicuous by its
absence.

Tomorrow morning, the same
lineup tries for the third triumph
in four years in the half-mile re-
lay. A win also retires this trophy,
but Stickel would make this look
much more secure.

Larkin, Tregoning, Carter, and
Del Anderson run the 440, 220, 220,
and 880 respectively, in the mile
sprint medley this afternoon, but
Indiana, with Roy Cochrane and.
Campbell Kane operating on each
end of this relay, should win in a
walk.

The most cherished of all Penn
titles is the one mile relay cham-
pionship of America. To defend

Thralls Reveals Demand for U. S. Collegians
In South American F ieltls after Recent Trip

.3)’ JEAN THOMS '

Back from a ﬂying trip to South
America, Miss Zoe Thralls, associ-
ate professor of geography, declar-
ed that it is an almost unexplored
commercial field for young Amer-
ican men and women.

Said tanned Miss Thralls, “South
as well as
North American-owned corpora-
tions are eager to employ college
trained boys from the States.” Not
all golden opportunities are for
men, either, explained Miss Thralls,
but girls from the United States are
much in demand for office work,
nursing, or in diplomatic service.
"Mining company officials," de-
clared Miss Thralls, “say they just
can’t keep a girl from the United
States —-—- they marry so quickly
down there.”

Advises Spanish

Young people interested in the
possibilities in South American in-
dustry should take a great deal of
Spanish, and go down with the idea
of remaining there for quite some
time, advised Miss Thralls.

Miss Thralls, who made the trip

to attend the Pan American Insti-
tute of History and Geography, was
the only woman delegate among the
11 who were chosen to represent
the United States.

Asked if the “Good Neighbor
Policy” is effective, Miss Thralls
replied that she felt it really is--
“especially so among the younger
people.” She explained that these
people have traveled much in the
United States, and like us and our
ways. In return, the attractive
geography professor said, South
Americans are very polite and
friendly with us when we visit
them. “During my whole trip,”
Miss Thralls exclaimed, “I never
received a discourteous word or
look.”

When questioned about the Ger-

man inﬂuence, Miss Thralls said
that she feels there is a deﬁnite Nazi
pressure on the Republics, but add-
ed that the people are strongly pro-
American. “There is also a strong
Japanese inﬂuence,” continued
Miss Thralls, “especially in Peru,
where I am told the Japanese colony
numbers 80,000." But she again

emphasized the fact that the people

' favor the United States. This feel-

ing is largely due to the enormous
trade the United States carries on
down there, and to the friendliness
of American business men in the
South American countries.

“Especially in Brazil and in Peru
on the west coast,” said Miss
Thralls, "immense quantities of
manufactures from the United
States are used." Pittsburgh pro-
ducts, she added, such as glass,
plumbing, and steel constitute a
great percentage of the imports.
Many U. S. Automobiles

Several times Miss Thralhs men-
tioned the large numbers of auto-
mobiles from the United States in
use in South America. They are
mostly Fords, she asserted, but
“Chevrolet is giving Ford :1 lot of
competition," she laughed. “I
couldn't get over it,” Miss Thralls
declared and laughed again at the
recollection, “why, all you have to
do, even in the very poorest sec-
tions of the cities, is to raise your
hand, and up chuggs an American-
made taxi!"

the best skit at the Engineers’ an-
nual stunt night smoker Wednes-
day in Trees gym. Imitations of
professors was the chief reason for
the electrical engineers’ winning,
in the opinions of the judges, who
were faculty members.

R. C. Goi-ham, associate profes-
sor of electrical engineering, was
the main victim. In the act, Gor-
ham was called a quorum because
he could start any meeting. The act
consisted of a four-man band with
dialogue between musical numbers.

Second place and no prize was
awarded to the mechanical engin-
eering group who presented a
blackface womanless wedding act.
The M. E.’s won the cup last year.

Other ski-ts included civil engin-
eers in a hillbilly shotgun wedding:
a picture of the future family of
an engineer by industrial engin-

eers; and a “girls” chorus -of
chemical engineers.
The cup, which must be won

three times before it can be kept
by a group. has the li_nes “Eng"n-
eering Association Stunt Night”
engraved on it. So far, it has been
won once by the mechanical engin-
eers and once by the electrical en-
gineers.

Judges f or the acts were Dr.
Bertram K. Hovey. instructor in
electrical engineering; William

Applegarth, instructor in mechan-
ical engineering; and L. C. Mc-
Candliss. professor and head of the
department of civil engineering.

The Right. to Strike
Is Still a Right

AS EDUCATED PEOPLE the students of the
University of Pittsburgh ought not to be taken
for a ride by the downtown newspapers.

When newspaper stories are slanted, Uni-
versity students ought to realize this. For in-
stance, they ought to know, before even taking
their evening or morning newspaper in their
hands, that the Press, the Tele, or the Post-
Gazette have certain dogmas.

One of these dogmas is that labor strikes are
completely unnecessary, that any labor leader
who leads such a strike is irresponsible, that
strikes can be settled beforehand, always.

It follows from this dogma that bills to pro-
mote anti-strike legislation are important and
necessary. And newspapers such as our city’s
can never ﬁnd anything wrong with anti-strike
legislation.

Now any educated person knows quite well
that strikes are necessary. For instance .the
present ‘strike at West Penn Hospital is the
culmination of 14 months negotiation between
maintenance workers and the Hospital. The
Ford strike came only after years of attempts
by unions to be recognized. When an employer
stubbornly refuses-to ‘accept a minimum of pro-
posals. from his employees, then the only way
to gainthese minimum proposals is to quit work
until- the-‘ employer comes around.

. ' _ =16, =3 * * 3'5

THERE HAS NEVER been any sound action
advanced to take the place of strikes. Actions
for f_orceable‘mediation are not necessary or
democratic, for mediation is a political maneu-
vering, the power of the opponents depending
upon theiriaggregate strength. And the strength
of 'p,u_lli'ng employees out of the factory is the
power upon which all union men rely, in the
last "analysis-.> ~ Deny them this right or privilege
or power, whatever you call it, and you deprive
them of the only means they have to back up
their proposals.

.Str:ikes. are necessary because if employees
cannot strike, then an employer does not ever

have"‘to agree with the workers’ proposals,

Never. He c'an'n_egotiate with them until, as
Henry. Ford.’s,right hand man, Harry Bennett,
said, “Hell freezes over.” In short an employer
can"pa7y' what he" likes, when he likes; he can
make.his men work as long as he likes, wherever
he likes; and he can hire and ﬁre whom he likes,
whenhe likes to. This is a medieval notion of
the ,er‘nployer’s duty. Times have changed.
Proposals -- to limit striking are usually ad-

vancéd by those who —h’ate‘labor unions.- Part’

of this hate has been instilled by irresponsible
newspapers. For instance one of the downtown
papers said that they saw nothing objectionable
about a law which would have made labor unions
toolsof the government, subject to virtual license
by the. national government. Of course they
saw nothing objectionable about it. They

wcre_n’tflooking for anything objectionable, and

they never will. _But. now a l.ot of other people

believe that this bill is O. K. There is the dan-

ger of the 'pr_e_ss. When controlled by a small

group it mustlthink as the small group thinks.
:3 >1: 3 2!: *

WE ARE " NOT REFORMERS. We don’t
know what to do. We believe that labor has
certain inalienable rights, the greatest of which
is the right to strike. When this right is taken
from them, then democracy will vanish.

In England 5,000 coal miners are on strike.

The Squire is a tall, broad-shouldered boy of thirty.
His life reads like a Collier‘s serial story, with well-
deﬁned waves of action and a series of events that are
not only impossible, but worse, improbable. At North
Dakota, he was a 148-pound first string fullback. When
he ﬁrst came to Washington he found himself edging
closer and closer to the gambling tables. He would
lose a few dollars each night and toss it off as a part
of the money that one must pay for amusement. One
night he made eighteen straight passes with the dice.
He had been pulling his money back on each roll and
he only made forty—three dollars. The man at his
elbow was riding with him, and left the gambling-
house with $20,000. The squire decidedto become ‘a
bookie.

The Squire is a big fellow. He stays away from
drink and tobacco. In fact, his only vice is booking.
He knows most of the important people of the town.
In the afternoon he drove up to a ﬂabby-faced police-
man outside the Capitol building. He said, “Say, I’ve
gothout-of-town plates and I might not know about
not being allowed to park over on that side. Would
that be all right?” The officer nodded. '

The colored man, short and thick-lippcd and with
a. dusty derby sitting squarely on the top of his head.
waited behind the soda bar in the drug store, standing
back from ‘the stools. The soda-jerk fumbled with the
ice cream until the negro placed his coins on the coun-
ter. He wrapped the ice-cream in a paper bag and
threw it to the colored man. The colored man caught
it and shuﬂied quickly out onto the street.

By Intercollegiate Washington Press

Formulation of a national draft
policy that will mean either an
army camp or more education for
an estimated 90,000 college students
subject to selective service after
July 1 moved rapidly toward com-
pletion this week.

In a joint statement of recom-
mended procedure——desig‘ned to
“eliminate confusion" among stu-

dents—na~tional draft headquarters
and the American Council on Edu-
cation are about to ask college and
university officials to:
(1) Place all available draft
information in the hands of stu-
dents immediately, and

(2) Take the initiative in ask-
ing deferment for students when
the present “blanket exemption”
expires.

The program, as ﬁnally agreed
upon this week, is purely voluntary.
Every university president in the
country, however, will be asked to
cooperate. 

Initially, college officials will be
requested to send a. “recommend-

ed list" to all students registered
for selective service. Drawn’ up
here during the past two weeks,
the letter will outline brieﬂy the
Position of students under the ex-
isting draft law, and will warn
college registrants who have al-
ready received their questionnaires
or have been classiﬁed that their
classiﬁcation will soon? be changed.

Deferred students will be asked
to prepare a “Statement of Informa-
tion,” which they will receive with
their draft letter.

This statement—the key item
in the new college-draft arrange-
ment—-will give st.udents an oppor-
tunity to describe in considerable
detail their classroom work, the
courses they have completed, their
relative scholastic standing, and
their post-graduation employment
0-“ﬂ00k- Space will be provided
for any additional information
that might aid local draft boards in
deciding a student’s “potential im-
portance” to national health, safe-
ty, or welfare. Students will be
asked speciﬁcally if they have as-
surances of a job after gradua-
tion.

When the “Statement of In.form'a-
tion” has been completed, each stu-
dent will be requested to mail one
copy to the local draft boardxand
to present a second copy to univer-
sity oﬁicials.

From this information, the ofli-
cial college records, and other “per-
tinent data,” college presidents‘
who agree to follow the plan that
will be outlined to them next wee};
——will prepare sworn afﬁdavits en-

dorsing each student’s information.-

Bing Crosby and Connie Boswell

In addition, they will categorically
answer the question:

“Occupational deferment for
this student is or is not recom-
mended.”

The afﬁdavits will go directly to
local draft boards, and. according
to present indications, will consti-
tute the chief basis for the occupa-
tional deferment of college students,
when draft boards undertake the
reclassification of approximately
40,000 to 60,000 students next July.

Copies of the “recommended let-
ter," the proposed student “State-
ment of Information,” and the uni-
versity affida\'it—all bearing the
endorsement of national draft offi-
cials—-are being sent as well to local
draft boards throughout the nation.

Coincidentally, local boards have
been reminded of Acting Draft Di-
rector Lewis B. Hershey’s advice
that:

“In determining whether a stu-
dent is a necessary man, the local
board should give due consider-
ation to such factors as the length
of time which the studentihas been
pursuing the course in question,
his relative progress and standing
in such course, and his relative
chances for employment or place-
ment in the activity for which he
is preparing."

The l’anth(-rs will be favored to capture their t

the year and second in succession
when they take the fie d against the
Teachers. Pitt has displayed plenty
of offensive power plus a better than
average pitching staff, ample in-
dication that the Indiana baseball-
ers will probably be defeated.

Pitt will be out to gain revenge
f'or the 7-6 setback handed them
by the Indiana team last year.
Practically the same nine athletes
who opened the game against Army
will make up the starting lineup.
Coach Mitterling is expected “to
start righthander Jim Egan against
the Teachers.

The Panther squad will be some-

the fact that hard hitting pitcher-

to remain in Pittsburgh and partic-

will leave Pittsburgh early Satur-

in plenty of time for the game. They
will departfor home immediately
following the match. The same
group which made the Army trip
will be sent to Indiana tomorrow.

Regardless of the present records
of the two teams, a red-hot battle
is anticipated by Panther mentor
Ralph Mitterling. In their two past
meetings with the Teachers, the Pitt
team has broken even,..winning the
1939 tilt and losing‘ last year's

I GDI’s Win All Campus Swim Meet;

Engineers Surprise; Greeks Absent

This year's all campus swimming
meet, taken by the Independents
at Trees pool last Tuesday, was
both disappointing and surprising.
It was disappdnting because of the
conspicuous absence O1 fraternity
competition.

The Independent boys had been
practicing for several weeks and
were getting set to give the frater-
nity follows a stiff battle for the
aquatic title. But with the excep-
tion of three Pi Lambda Phi stal-
warts. when the important moment
came. the Greek brothers were
missing.

Engineers Show Well

One of the big surprises of the
meet was the remarkable showing
of the deﬁnitely underrated engi-
neer entry. Witn only a ﬁve man
squad representing them, the en-
gineers won three events, and
broke a couple of records in do-
ing it.

Their medley relay trio of M05-
ko, Shulness. and Shank splashed
through the 120-yard course in
1.10.1, setting a new record that
probably won't be broken for quite
a while. Mosko came back to swim
the 40-yard backstroke in 23.4.
easily beating the old mark of 24.1.
Shulness gave the engineers on-
other ﬁrst place in the 40-yard
breaststroke.

ments and surprises of the water

dependent swimmers might possi-

Spring Football Practice
Ends With Squad Contest

Spring football drills bow out of
the Pitt sports picture tomorrow
morning when the draft-ridden as
well as baseball ridden second team
squad endeavors to get revenge over
the varsity combination in the last
intro-squad game of the season.

As a result of’ the two previous
contests. the outlook is not at all

rosy.’ The varsity team has shown
classy ball handling‘ as well as
fine defensive work during the

spring practice tilts. but the second

team material is of mcdiocre cal-

iber. _

_W;=.lter West has capably handled
the signal calling assignment. Play-

with his third straight win.

West Homers , _

Led by Frank Dax and pitcher
Mike Sotack, the Phi Kaps con-

all of their runs in the fourth on

ler.

In the last fraternity contest,
Walt West drove a long ﬂy over

The White Sox and Gamma Woos
provided the entertainment in the

in the last inning when Steve Shu-

Lace, Crosby Win

Last Friday afternoon, the minor
sports held the spotlight in the fra-

the day.

Jim Lace and “Bing" Crosby

PiKA house in tennis. 6-1 and 8-6.
The Phi Eps. with Wally Hirsch and

Only line regulars certain of
starting posts are Stan Gervelis,
veteran terminal, Steve Sinco, two
year letterman at center, Ralph
Fife, potential All-American guard,
and Harry Kindelberger, bulky vet-
eran tackle.

“Tex” Hinte, Marty Rosepink
and Mike Sinco are, at the present
time, leading all candidates for the
vacated end spot.

Scheduled to play understudy to
rugged Steve Sinco are veterans

Tackle seems to be the weakest
part of the team, for Benghauser‘s
low draft number hurt. On the
other side of Kindelberger is a hole
that must be ﬁlled from among Bob

Vince Antonelli has the inside

In I ntramurals

Establishing themselves as an
early season favorite by their 1-0
victory over the Gamma Gamma
Woos, the Whitesox will try to
make it two'°straight over an un-
tested YMCA team today in the
second round of the Independent
schedule.

The slugging of Steve Shuber and
the pitching of Zabric, who set down

in this battle. ‘

other interesting game at 3 o’clock.

Not much is known about either
team since this is the ﬁrst year
of competition for both. The Bus
Ad team is rebuilt from one of last
years topnotch outﬁts, PBI, .but all
of their stars have graduated. —

For the first time since the intra-
mural set-up was started, a team
will-. be entered from the Medical
School.-. This precedent-setting out-
ﬁt, labeled the Medical Sophs, will
tackle the Sluggers in their open-
ing contest.

Also starting their second round
will be the Engineering league bat-
tlers. One of the best games in this
series will be the AE & ME Senior
team againstthe Oil and Gas squad.

The AE & ME team will have to
be rebuilt, for all the members of
last year's outﬁt, which placed ﬁrst
in their league, have graduated.

Another top-notcher is the con-
test between the Chemical Sophs
and the lClL‘cti‘ical.<. The Electric-
als will be Ll.\'ln_£.' the same team.
plus few more additions. that

Kokotsis Paints Unique Ceiling
In Greek Nationality Classroom

‘By.’ “7II.I.I.\\.V| JAZVIISON

The University will be the possessor of the only room of its kind in
the United States when Demetaios Kokotsis of Athens, perhaps the most
celebrated of Greek contemporary painters, climbs down from his
scaltold in the Greek room in the Cathedral. ' V

K(‘vl§()i":$l_~', the only painter for
v-:‘nov.n King George II of Greece
eva-;~r p"c'£l. is the creator of the por-
‘i.1‘f.lil. 01' John rvletaxas in the Greek
capital. He was born on the Islzmcl
o Crete and studied for six years
in the Beaux Arts Academy in
Athe: s. Kokotsis came to America
two years ill3,0 where his work hzis
received favorable ccmincnt.

A score of his old p-.iintin;_»,s are
on exhibit in the Gillespie galleries
in Pi;t.\.l:m.i‘gl1, and ;~:.evcr:.il of his
works may be se-cit in the F.-_:cL1lly
club.

The artist uses the technique of
the old masters in his work. Every
detail is caret'u1ly worked out. Al-
thou9,'h he is :1 portrait painter, Ko-
kotsis considers his work in the
CLlClleCll'1.ll in his line. “This room
is Greece in Americz-.,’ he said in
halting‘ Englisii, “I paint her por-
trail."

The richly colored ceiling is a
reproduction of the ceiling in the
1‘-‘artht-.r.on. The capitals of the col-
Ll_I'Xll1;< are like those of the Erecthe-
um in Athens. Part 01‘ the ceiling
is ll rich blue color.

""E.x,'r-.ry niglit about live or six
o'clock," explained Kokots’s, “The
slay or l-’ittsou2.‘gl1 is this color.”
