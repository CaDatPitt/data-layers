with a'con_sideration of the ,c‘ause'sf
"which lead up to the inception of the
so-called Laldollette. party. He quoted
the old ‘standard example of the Dem-

which would have been one for every
man in the (service. He bitfterly" cited
the --Republican party in.-..the_re(_rent

After he had proven that theparty
did not arisMeMf_-I"om any unworMthy-im-

sic principles. He was very emphatic
in impressing’ on the group the-Mfact
that it”,-was . absolutely-_ ridiculous to
coinparej their conservatism with the

Panther cheering Better.
- Whileeveryono is gossiping. about
the. players, it would behoove us to
take a look at the actionjin the Pitt
cheering stands. A thousand times
better than the noise made at the La-

out-across Forbes Field, and although
they didn’t give the'_Panther thefina!
punch that he lacked at the “laid
goals, they did ~make‘hirn feel ‘that
he shared his great sorrow-with some.
one else and thathe lost with the stu-
dent. body (7) not _alone.. it might
also be said that the Pitt stands out-
roared those of Carnegie, although
the winners. had fewer throats to‘ be-
come hoarse. . -
After the game,A.nowspapers carried
account ofthe Panther spirit, extolled
the student body for sticking until
the last play, and {stamped it as the
outstanding feature of the day. That,

ifying after he listened to, the puny
sereeehes that. seeped“ out

stands tat the Maroon clash- Then

’ too, the Pitt Cheering has been stead. .

ily on the Arise, for that at the West
