Posvar 0rders Hiring Freeze   353 Wi” V0“ 70"”    
e     0n Ziegler Appearance .

BY HARRIS LEVY

Hiring of Pitt faculty and staff
personnel has been frozen by Pitt
Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar who
cited a shortage of state funding as

' he impetus to postpone ﬁlling
vacant posts,_.possib1y eliminating
them. .

Posvar cited Governor Shapp’s
refusal to sign Senate Bill 1953,
which would have given Pitt $1.3
million in .a supplemental appro-
priation to cover “unanticipated
escalations in the cost of utilities
and maintenance.” .

“Effective February 1, I have
asked each Vice Chancellor and the
Provost to review personally all
requests for new staff and faculty

. appointments and the ﬁlling of all

vacancies in, their respective
areas,” said Posvar in a Pitt
Update released February 3.

“Ou problem is basically that we

- have to tighten _our belts,” Vice

Chancellor _of «Planning and Budget

_ Jack E. Freeman agreed.

reeman added.‘

)

“The reasons are unanticipated
utility costs and inﬂation and the
very uncertain situation regarding
state funding for next year,”
“We’ll try to
restrict expenditures for the eur-

rent year and avoid making long .

.term personnel committments,”

’ Freeman said. “We want to insure

that to the extent. that vacancies are
ﬁlled, it’s because they’re essential
and not just because they’re
there.”

Posvar’s statement added, “Fil-
ling of only those positions consid-
ered essential to the performance

"”"‘of the " mission of a _given ofﬁce,

department, or school will be
approved.” Personnel forms in-
volving hiring will not be processed
unless they are signed by the

DA Hickton Seeks

Mazzei Indictment
In New charges

Pitt Trustee Board member Frank
Mazzei has been charged by
Allegheny County District Attorney

John Hickton with seven counts of u In

political corruption stemming from
his term as state Senator represen-

-ting the Pittsburgh’s‘ Oakland

district.

The latest charges, "following
Mazzei’s conviction for extortion,
include six counts of violating state
electoral proceedure and one count
of extortion.

Hickton has’ requested the State
Supreme Court to issue a writ
commanding Mazzei to show why
he should not immediately forfeit
his senate seat.”

 The new accusations result for

Mazzei's acceptance of $20,000
from BMI Incorporated of Pitts-
burgh which held leases for two
state agencies.

ging.”

Provost or the appropriate Vice
Chancellor, ‘the statement added.

Requests for hiring submitted by
the appropriate dean or director
must document the need for the

position and elaborate the conse- .

quences of leaving it vacant.
“No new employment may be
made for any kind of program when

— a person. already employed by the

University whose position may be
terminated or who is on unemploy-
ment compensation is reasonably
well-qua1iﬁed,” according to the
Update statement. .

“At this point in time, the freeze
will continue until we can get a fix
on the state appropriations for next
year,” said Vice Chancellor of
Business and Finance Joseph A‘.
Dutton. “If.they’re adequate, then
we can unfreeze the freeze.”

The Governor’s budget proposal
for the next ﬁscal year has not been
released yet. '

Posvar’s statement said “The
outlook for funding that is sufﬁ-
cient to our needs is not encoura-
Major decreases in the
budget will hopefully not be neces-
sary, according to Posvar.

“We must exercise prudent man-
agement and attempt to reduce
expenses if we -are to provide

economic security for our present
faculty and staff, as wekk as
maintain the quality of our pro-
grams. '

The Pitt Professional Unio_n re-
futed Posvar’s statement in a
release yesterday.

“The Chancellor’s order illus-
trates the vulnerability of all em-
ployees of the University to the
Chancellor’s unilateral decisions,”

Univ. to Air complaints
Before Commission

BY BILL MOORE

Student, faculty, and university
staff opinion will be aired at a
special meeting Thursday of the
Pitt‘News study commission.

The study commission was creat-
ed in October, to study the Pit’:
News and its "relationship with the
University community, particularly
the administration and Student
Government.

Commission chairman, Walter_

Glazer, a professor in the history

department, said the meeting to-‘

morrow was called to hear the
opinions of the University com-
munity on editorial policy, news
coverage, and internal operations
of the Pitt News. A -

from four years of college studies
“virtually unscathed by educa-
tion.” .

To assist the job seeker, present
or future, the Pitt News collected
the following impressions and com-
ments from conversations with
ten major Pittsburgh ‘employers
and other professional job coun-
selors. ‘

SELLING YOURSELF

Of chief concern is the candidate’s'
ability to demonstrate what US
Steel’s college relations manager
David Bates called “a genuine and

prepared to justify

 

deﬁnable interest in coming to
work for us.”
‘That is half of what is meant by
selling yourself and for the typical
liberal arts major, who lacks the
marketable skills of engineer or
"accountant, there is nothing else to
sell. _ I
The success of an interview may
rest on how the subject responds to
feelers as unimaginative as, “Why
did you choose our firm?” He
should welcome such questions
because they offer open invitations
to showcase his knowledge of the
company’ and to discuss how his

- career goals led to the choice.

Every employer believes his com-
pany is an acknowledged leader in
its ﬁeld in somerespect, pointed
out Robert Liken, vice president of
Liken Employment, one of Pitts-

,burgh’s largest private employ-

ment agenices. Any hint of a
question like, “This is a beautiful
building but just what do you do
here?” may earn an explanation,
though never a job. »_
“A .lot of student go to Pitt

‘because they want to stay home;

they can’t really crystallize their
porcesses beyond this,” said
PNBTs Gillis, himself a Pitt grad.
They will apply at a company only
because it is local and that comes
out in the interview, he said.

The candidate should also be
his career
decision. '

relationship of the Pitt News with
Student Government and‘ the Uni-
versity, and on the role of the paper
as a student activity. .

"There is a natural, inevitable
conflict in deﬁning what the Pitt
News is and should be." he said.
“The paper has a dual role as the
main conduit of information about
various activities on campus and as
an educational activity for those on
the staff."

Student Government president
Mike Furick, a non-voting member

earlier this week to various student

Since the signing of the contract at a time when all but 20 of Gallo’s

curious about the workings of a

Rhetoric majors should be en-

thralled by Ziegler’s stories of

swaying public opinion and cleverly

obscuring facts.

In fact, any student should be
curious to see how Nixon, a man
they may have voted for,'abused
his ofﬁce and misled the public,
and few were closer to the action
than Zeigler.

It will be more than interesting to I

hear Ziegler’s rationalization of his
role in the Watergate cover-up.

Ziegler wants to speak. The

We should not be denied the

The Ziegler Letters

Ziegler’s Speech:
is He Ghostly?

To the Editor:

The Student Government Pro-
gramming Committee has invited
Ron Ziegler to speak on campus.
Isn’t that nice. This decision was
made without any input from the
student body beyond the divine
inspiration of the SG Programming
Committee. Isn’t that consistent.
He will be paid $2500 out of our
activities fee. Isn’t that ghastly.

Seriously, this is not a laughing
matter. Apparently the Program-
ming Committee. believes bringing
Mr. Ziegler to speak would be
beneficial to the students at Pitt. I
do not deny that hearing various
points of view is constructive and
consistent with a liberal academic
community ethic. However, we are
not simply dealing with point of

, view here, but with a man who
earned his livelihood through the
subversion and manipulation of

- reality as seen in the media.

What went through the mind of
Ms. Wendy Traub and her col-
legues is anyone’s guess. Student
opinion could not have been con-
sidered‘ in earnest. Unfortunately,
the money appropriated _ for, most
activities -is determined by a small
group. "T The .students have little
voice as to where they activities fee
is used. However, on many issues
there is a perceived consensus of
opinion. Whether or not this
perception is justified is another
matter. (I trust in the future a more
responsible means will be found to
ascertain student opinion.) But
certainly there was no consensus of
opinion with regard to Mr. Ziegler.
What has been done, simply stat-
ed, is this:

decide what is good for the
students and inthe processit has
run roughshod over -their opinions.
Mr. Ziegler will be getting $2500
for one'day’s engagement at Pitt.
We are told by some that this a
modest fee. . However, I don’t
remember being asked what I
consider a modest amount. Com-
parisons are than made with past
speakers. Three stand out for
reflection: Angela Davis, Robert
' Welch, and James_McCord~. Ang.ela
Davis and Robert Welch represent
political extremes on the left and
right respectfully. However,
neither one is an apostle of deceit.
We may evaluate their views, but
* few believe their integrity is in-
. credulous. This is not the casewith
. Mr. "Ziegler. McCord exposed
Watergate while Ziegler _ exacer-
bated what he termed a “caper.”
Also, McCord came to Pitt for a fee
which is mere fraction of what Mr.
Ziegler desires.
Many on this campus feel there. is
a fundamental inconsistency‘ be-
tween promoting academic free-
dom and perpetuating the wealth of
an actor who sought to undermine
that freedom. Do you want your

University to be. the first major.

institution to bring this man to
speak? Such a precedent would do
wonders fo Pitt’s reputation among
collegues at other schools. What is
so depressing here, is‘ that there is
so little one can do to stop this
oncoming mess.

I hope the _members of the
Programming Committee are hap-
py with their decision. They will
have to live with it. Unfortunately,
so will all who are associated with
Pitt. ’

One ﬁnal note. Wendy, I implore
you—Don_’t choose Frank Fitzi-
-mmons to talk on ‘Gallo 'Wine as
your next speaker. I fear such an

action would be all. too consistent

A committee has '
chosen in a paternalistic fashion to.

“Inoperative"

Is Not Enough

To The Editor:

It is 1975 and the moral issue of
Watergate is still not ‘behind
us...and maybe that is not such a
bad thing. The. moral issue has
gone before the press and the
public, gone before the Congress,
gone before the Courts. Now it has

«come to rest ‘in our academic

institutions, our centers of learning
and enlightenment. It is evident
that as a nation we do not embrace
the body of thought and the moral
watchwords for which Ronald

Ziegler has been and remains a

spokesman. History has a way of

dealing with social. and moral‘

thought of the past, and it is in the
academic institution that these
philosophies, in historical context,
evolve through the enlightenment
process.

.. The issue is not freedom, of

speech. The moral outrage
expressed by students and faculty
at this University and on other
campuses around the country
should not be dismissed without
requisite analysis. No one denies
Mr. Ziegler’s right to speak on this

V _ campus, or even the payment of his

expenses in coming here to do

such. What is questioned then is -

his right to» proﬁt from such an
endeavor. ' _ y
Even today, in the face of an
overwhelming burden of evidence
as to the intent and veracity of his
mentor’s speech and conduct, Mr.
Ziegler ignores the issue of his _role
as a spokesman for these untruths.
He has yet to be taken to the task
for his role in the day to day
cover-up. The people's right to
know the truth was and is of
paramount importance. ‘ ‘Inopera-
tive” is not enough. The very
fabric of our system was under-

mined by the conduct of the Nixon V

White House. These individuals

knowing what management is all
about, he is in trouble," said
Walter Ritenour, director of re-
cruiting and placement for Pitt’s
graduate business school. He cited

who eagerly applies for a personnel
management position announcing
how he “like to deal with people.”

The applicant has not sold him-
self, however, until he convinces
the employer that he can do the
job. '

In US Steel's case, though 95% of
the liberal arts graduates hired for
management training previously
held summer jobs as steelworkers
with the company, there is the
other 35 % who “banged on the
door” and persuaded a department
head they had something important
to offer, Bates said.

%9!1e counselor suggested the stu- ~
" de‘nt’s first step should be to take

stock of his assets and liabilities,
both tangible and intangible.
Although related work experience
is an obvious plus, most employers
view any work record as aniasset.
A candidate who doesn’t list a" job
because itfalls near the bottom of
the job hierarchy may be doubly
penalizing himself. He is failing

not only to take credit for work/

experience but also, possibly, ‘to
account for a period of time.

sider other demands on the stu-
dent’s time. ’

Most require evident the job

INTERVIEW MECHANICS

“If you are too tense, you will not
interview well,” said a professional
employment counselor who asked
not to be identified. He suggested
practicing interviews with friends

and predicted the ‘preparation in-
 'volved.1n -researching a company

will, in and of itself, ease tensions.
He also warned against canned

answers to questions. “An exper- '

ienced interviewer will see through
them so fast it will make your head
spin,” he said.

Some candidates forget the
basics: Be early, be conservatively
dressed, submit your resume in
advance if possible and have with
you grade transcripts, proof of
military serviceif any and samples
of your work if applicable.

  Here’s Job Hunting Help

The applicant should expect to be
asked, “Do you have any ques-
tions?" Although questions may
make the difference between a
ten-minute and a half-hour inter-
view, they should be meaningful,
not merely time ﬁllers. The
candidate should Listen—the an-
swers are for his benefit and may
help him make his decision. A

The big question is still unans-
wered. When two or more similar-
ly qualiﬁed people go into an
interview, what determines who
gets the job?

“It isn’t all charisma, it isn’t all
beauty—there’s a sincerity that
gets through, that communicates to
the employer,” said Dorothy
Graves, manager of the South-
western Pennsylvania Job Bank of
the. Bureau of Employment Se-
curity. ' A

How do you communicate that
sincerity?

and better preparation,” the un-
identiﬁed employment counselor
concluded.

Sweet Sounds of Voice

BY JIM OPPENHEIMER

On the evening of January 27, the
Oberlin College Choir directed by
Daniel Moe, presented a concert in
Carnegie Hall. I heard the choir in
1965, when its director was Robert

Fountain, and it was an excellent-

ensemble. This concert showed
that it continues to adhere to very
high musical standards.

The program began with Quem
Vidist-is Pastores by Richard Der-
ing, followed by Die mit Traenen
Saeen by Johann Hermann Schein.
In this piece, there are distinct
fugal patterns. One part presents a
short theme, and the other parts,
one by one, enter later with the
same thern_e.. The choir sang with
clarity, and even though the parts
often conflicted, they were always
distinct. The singing of the
sopranos when divided in two parts

was confident, clear, and with fine .

intonation.

The concert continued with Der
Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf
by Back, a work for double choir. It

was less effective because the two

.: l;

Wednesdavairebruarvs;1975 

choirs weren't separated, but ad:
jacent to one another, although it

two pieces show how perverse,
experimental, and sensitive a com-
poser America had in Charles

’ Ives.

The concert continued with 0 All
Ye by Joseph Wood, Prelude and
Hodie by Daniel Moe, Motet, Op.
75, No. 2 by Johannes Brahms and
concluded with Praise to God by
Knut Nystedt. Moe’s composition
was quite effective, beginning at a
fairly low key, and working up to a
festive ﬁnale. His style shows a
sensitivity to the text which other

orks in the concert lacked.

The Nystedt piece featured sec-
tions where the choir “speaks” and
“whispers” the words of the text.
While this can be an extremely
effective technique, Nystedt
shamelessly drives it into the

ground.

I am very sorry that one area of
choral music, the vast amount of
Russiam Orthodox music. all for “a
cappelle'' ‘ choir, was not- repre-
sented in the concert. I mention
this because the Oberlin ‘choir is
quite able to handle the demands of
this gorgeous section of the choral
literature, which is being totally
and inexcusably neglected by most
groups.

There are at least ten records of
the Oberlin College Choir avail-
able, at four dollars per record. For
further details, write to the Oberlin
College» Choir, Oberlin Conserva-
tory of Music, Oberlin, Ohio
44074. ‘

An interesting contrast to the
Oberlin Choir concert was the
concert on Tuesday evening, given

by the Pittsburgh Camerata, di-
rected by Arthur Wenk. The
Pittsburgh Camerata normally

— sings works of the medieval or

rennaissance, but this time, the
program was all by Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart, in.celebration of
his 219th birthday. The program
included four sacred songs, the
Piano Concerto in E-ﬂat, K. 449,
with the director as soloist, and the
Missa Brevis in D Major, K. 194.
All soloists, especially Beverlee
Kollar and Mary Ricker, sopranos,
performed quite well. _

The Camerata is a small, intimate
group of persons from the Pitts-
burgh area. One member estimat-
ed about half of the group is
students,‘ and *one person is a
lawyer.

This is a new group, and probably
needs a ‘bit more polish, but the
concert was enjoyable and well

done.

Columbia, S.C. -- The Pitt
basketball team is now relaxing in
the Carolina Inn in preparation for

._,this evening’s game against the

‘South Carolina Gamecocks, a team’

which, like the Panthers. almost
never loses on their home ﬂoor.

The SC squad currently boasts a
record of 12-5, but their home court
record so far this season is an
impressive 9-0. on the other hand,
the Cats will be after only their
second road victory of the season.
The Cats overall mark stands at
11-7 but their road record is a
dismal  7.

The Panthers, to say the least, are

 about to face a stiff challenge,

possibly their toughest of the year.

Those persons endowed with the
great distinction of enumerating
the Top Twenty college basketball
teams in the nation, have once
again failed miserably. . . .

Normally I don’t‘ ponder the
integrity of the Top "Twenty, but
since I am a Pitt basketball fan, the
time has come. when I must
perform my duty.

Pitt should be ranked in the Top
Twenty. ‘I decided that on the basis"
of logical reasoning and also ‘by
Divine Inspiration, and because I
am an intelligent and well informed
citizen, I will explain how I came to
this conclusion.

‘‘I’d like to play more, but the
job,” Keese says, What his own
modesty fails to reveal is that he
too, is doing a good job when given
the chance.

Against Rollins, for instance, the
6’10” senior from Large, Florida
dominated the game during the few
moments he competed. Keese had
9 points, 11 rebounds,‘ and more
rejections than Nixon’s Supreme

gets their hopes up, thinking new_

angrier at Ridl that Loosh was.

“I don’t know what the strategy
was (against Rutgers),” he sighs.
“I only played for about a minute,
but I quess they were just faster
than I was.” '

just'doen’t appear to this guy at

’ least, that Keese’s presence in the .

line-up hurts the Panthers. Indeed,
his "teammates seem to become
nearly as aroused as the fans when
the amiable Keese debuts nightly.
The ironic element in Ridl’s
failure to use Keese more often is
that the center has made garantuan
improvements in his game. A
“I’ve been more patient on‘of,-

Keese reacts warmly to the end-

“I know the fans want to see me

play harder when I get in there.”

South Carolina and Pitt have
played just two mutual opponents,
Marquette and St. Joseph’s with
Pitt topping both teams and the
Gamecocks winning one and
losing one. Marquette managed to
defeat SC earlier this year’ by a
69-60 score but that was with the

home court advantage. The two '

teams will meet later this month in
the SC Coliseum and the result
should be just the opposite.

Tonight's game is an important
one for both squads as they strive
for NCAA tournament bids. The
Coliseum should be well ﬁlled
tonight; the, Gamecocks are
averaging over 10,000 fans per
home game, and the Cats will

':“Before Allen was

BY RALPH BERN STEIN
AP Sports Writer —

PHILADELPHIA AP--Are_ the
Philadelphia Phillies tampering
with the Atlanta Braves’ rights to
Dick Allen? '

fa“ Phillies’ president.Ruly Carpenter
' . "says “no way.”

Braves’ vice * president Eddie
Robinson has asked baseball
commissioner Bower Kuhn to
investigate’ reports that Phillies’
players sounded out Allen on the
idea of playing with Philadelphia.

Kuhn confirmed Tuesday that the
Braves had asked for an investiga-'
tion and that it was under way.

The exchange stemmed from a
story by Allen Lewis in the Tuesday
morning editions of the Philadel-
phia Inquirer.

Lewis wrote that the Phillies are
“tip-toeing through negotiations
which may result in the return of

-“‘”,,\Dick Allen to the team...They’re
I proceeding softly, slowly‘ and ’

carefully so as not to be saddled
with a charge of tampering.”
Apparently the move, if true, was
not softly, slowly or carefully
enough.
“I have asked the commissioner

of baseball’s office to investigate‘

the possibility of the Philadelphia
Phillies tampering with Dick
Allen,” Robinson said. ,

“I feel we have the best right
handed hitter in baseball. ' If he

' plays, we want him to play for the .

Braves,” Robinson declared.
Allen announced his retirement
last September,

before the end of the 1974 season.
‘The White Sox last December dealt
Allen to the Braves.
Allen has indicated that he would
like to return to baseball, but not
with the Braves. _Robinson recently
visited the slugger at Allen’s farm
in Perkasie, Pa., near Philadelphia,
in an attempt to change his mind.
traded ‘to
Atlanta, the Phillies approached
him and asked if he would return to
Philadelphia--if the Phillies ac-
quired him from Chicago. Allen
said he would never play in
Philadelphia again, because of his
/problems with the media in the City
of Brotherly Love.

Allen played with the Phillies six
years before he was traded to the
St. Louis Cardinals five years ago.

A The Cards sent him to the Los

Angeles Dodgers a year later. The
following season, Los Angeles
dealt the feared home run hitter to
the White Sox.

According to Lewis, Phillies’
infielders Dave Cash and Mike
Schmidt visited with Allen and told
him how badly many of‘ the key
players, as well as the Phillies
organization, wanted him, and how
certain they were that with him
they could win the National League
pennant.

“The more Allen listened the

' more he liked the idea,” Lewis

wrote. A
Cash denied his alleged part in

, trying to convince Allen he should

play for the Phillies.

“We weren’t sent out there to
recruit Allen,” declared the second
baseman. We weren’t sent out
there by the ball club. We were
invited out by Allen for a social
evening.” -

Cash laughed when he heard the
story.

“There is no way anyone could
send me out there,” Cash said.
“You can’t do that. That’s against
the rules.

“It was purely a social visit. '

Atlanta Complains AI..,.}

Allen and the Phillies. There is no

way we could get into that subject.
“If I can be faulted for a ‘social

visit then I'm guilty,” Cash said.

' Sure we talked about baseball. I

had heard a lot of things about

Allen and I wanted to hear his ideas‘

on the game.”

Carpenter said he had talked with
Robinson and assured him that the
Phillies had not tampered wit
Allen. - '

“We never even considered
approaching Allen without the
permission of theAtlanta Braves,”
Carpenter said. _

“Schmidt and Cash paid’ a social
call on Allen,” Carpenter related.

“They played cards, looked at
Richie’s horses," talked about
baseball,” Carpenter said. “No
one here the Phillies sent anyone
on any m1ss1on.”

Carpenter went on:. “I cannot
.control the social life of my players.

If Richie is at the track and one of
my players is there and they talk
baseball, I can’t control that.

“We have nothing to hide. We
haven’t done anything dishonest or
against the rules. «

There is no question that we’re
interested if Atlanta wants to trade
him. But at this point I think it’s
obvious that :the Braves" are
interested only in having Allen
report to their camp. Robinson
wants Allen in his lineup and I can
understand that.” '_ A

“Can you imagine what our lineup
would be like with Allen, Greg
Luzinski and Schmidt in the middle
of our batting order. A I

It would give the Phillies last
season’s two major league home
run champions--Schmidt and Allen.

“Ethically, .I- can’t do anything
right now,” Carpenter said. "
"‘At this point we're going to have
to sit back and see what Allen is
going to do. If he takes a stand and
comes out publicly about not
playing in Atlanta, then we might
do something.” .

Carpenter recalls the problems '
Allen gave the Phillies last time he
was here; ﬂouting of rules other
players must live with. '
