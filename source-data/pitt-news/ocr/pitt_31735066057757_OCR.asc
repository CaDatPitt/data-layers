Siucleni dies of alcohol poisoning

By Mark Gordon
and Sam Gresock

F gr TM @ News

A Pitt student died Friday morning, two

' days after drinking 16 shots of whiskeyin

less than an hour while celebrating his 21st
birthday.

The student’s father said his son never
drank before, while a bartender at Mitchell’s
Tavern said he has seen the student drinking
at parties before.

Questions surrounding Atif Bhatti’s death
have caused Leon Haley, vice chancellor for
student and public affairs, to initiate a spe-
cial investigation into the incident.

Bhatti, a senior, was pronounced dead at
approximately 8:30 a.m. Friday. According
to a county coroner’s office spokesperson,
the cause of Bhatti’s death was chronic alco-
hokoverdose, pending further investigation.

“He has never drank before,” his father
Maqbool Bhatti said. “I am very upset. I and
my family are in a period of mourning.”

Mike Giles, a bartender at Mitchell’s, said
he was working the night Bhatti and his
friends were drinking.

“I had seen [Bhatti] at parties, drinking
before. I recognized him as someone I’d
seen before,” Giles said. “It’s a shame and a
real tragedy.” "

Bhatti, the son of Maqbool and Nasim

Bhatti of Russelville, Ark.. was an honors
pre-med student at Pitt and a member of the
Delta Sigma Phi fraternity. He was to visit
the University of Arkansas School of
Medicine later this month for an interview.

Bhatti’s fratemity said, “It was an unfortu-
nate incident, and our thoughts and prayers
are with our brother.”

On Tuesday, at approximately 11:30 p.m..
Bhatti and three’ of his fratemity brothers left
the fraternity house on Dithridge Street. The
group went to Mitchell’s Tavern on Centre
Avenue in North Oakland, according to Pitt
Director of Public Safety Rick Boyd.

At the bar, Bhatti consumed 16 shots of

Dukakis discusses health care

By John B. Moore

Asst. News Editor

Former presidential candi-
date Michael Dukakis went
ahead with his health care
reform lecture, despite fail-
ing to make revisions fol-
lowing Tuesday’s election
results.

Speaking at the University
Club on Thursday, former
Massachusetts Gov.
Dukakis said, “I’m frank to
tell you I’m not sure what I
would have done by way of
revision in these past two
days  Certainly what hap-
pened on Tuesday is going
to affect [health care] even
more.”

Although a Republican-
controlled Congress means
passing a govemment-man-
dated universal health care
bill will take longer,

Dukakis said he is still com-
mitted to the cause.

Because the debate for
health care reform did not
begin until well into the
congressional election year,
Dukakis blames the elec-
tions for failure to get bipar-
tisan support.

“Bob Dole is a case in
point,” said Dukakis. “Early
in deliberations, Senator
Dole said that universal cov-
erage was a must, the only
question was how to get it 
as the public relations
assault continued to mount
on the president’s plan,
Senator Dole finally aban-
doned all pretense of sup-
port for a meaningful plan.”

Quoting from a Newsweek
magazine article, Dukakis
said opponents to health
care reform spent an esti-
mated $300 million to stop a

Jim Madl/Staff Photographer

bill from being passed.

“The opponents to the
president’s plan outspent
proponents on television, by
something like six-to-one,”
Dukakis said.

Dukakis, who teaches
full-time at Northeastern
University and spent a
semester teaching at the
University of Hawaii, said
we should look to that state
as an example for reforming
health care in the rest of the
country.

“The Hawaii system is
simple, it’s not bureaucratic
and it’s very attractive,” said
Dukakis. “All employers
and employees, without
exception, must contribute
to the cost of every employ-
ee’s health insurance in the
state of Hawaii.”

NEW YORK —— USAir, the
troubled airline whose record in
the last 20 years has been the
worst of any major U.S. airline,
continues to be plagued by safe-
ty and training lapses, according
to a major examination con-
ducted by The New York Times.

The newspaper, in its Sunday
edition, said a national team of
FAA inspectors last year found
more than 40 deficiencies in
USAir’s ﬂight operation and
training programs for its more
than 5,000 pilots.

In addition, the Times report-
ed USAir was more than $2 bil-
lion in debt and losing $2 mil-
lion each day, causing some

employees to feel pressure to’

keep planes ﬂying.

In one case, the newspaper
said, USAir violated FAA regu-
lations by permitting a plane to
fly for 13 days without proper
repairs to a dented and cracked
wing ﬂap. — Reuters

Dukakis-

-From page 1
Hawaii’s bill, he said the leg-
islation is only 25 pages long,
in comparison to the.presi—
dent’s bill which is 1,300
pages.

Dukakis said reform could
not be implemented on a
state-to-state basis because
once a state enacts mandated
universal coverage, the
employers would move to a
neighboring state. ,

Hawaii has one of the high-
est life expectancies and low-
est infant mortality rates in
the country. The reason, he
said, is because just about
everyone has health insur-
ance, and they go to the doc-
tor when they first get sick.

“As a result, Hawaiians
spent about 40 percent less
time in the hospital than we
do, and that saves a lot of
money,” Dukakis said.

Stating that health care is
still a major concern, Dukakis
said national polls taken with-
in the past month show
Americans haven’t backed
away from the issue that
played a prominent role in the
1992 elections;

“Public opinion hasn’t
changed all that much,”
Dukakis said. “A hundred
million dollars in TV spots
certainly created doubts about
the president’s plan in the
minds of a lot of Americans,
but that’s the bottom line in

I most lobbying strategies —

create doubt.”

liquor and an undetermined amount of beer,
Boyd said.

Bhatti and his brothers left the bar at
approximately l2:l5—a.m. and returned to
the fraternity house. Bhatti’s brothers placed
him on a couch and turned his head in case
he got sick, Boyd said. Boyd said it was
undetermined when exactly Bhatti passed
out.

Bhatti was still breathing when a brother
checked on him at around 4 a.m. Sometime
within the next 45 minutes, Bhatti stopped
breathing.

“When a brother went to check on him
around 4:45 a.m., his face was blue and he
had stopped breathing,” Boyd said.

A fraternity brother administered mouth-
to-mouth resuscitation to Bhatti, and he
resumed breathing. "Bhatti was taken by
paramedics to Presbyterian University
Hospital, where he was placed in critical
condition. Friday morning his parents made
the decision to take him off a life-support
system, according to Boyd.

“He was treated at the scene by para-
medics, but he did not have a pulse when
they arrived,” Boyd said. “We have asked
that an additional investigation be brought
into the situation, and we will work with the
coroner’s oﬂice.”

Control Enforcement might also be involved

be reached for comment.

The coroner’s spokesperson said they are
still awaiting toxicology test results, and if
there is possible criminal negligence, the
investigation will be turned over to the
major crimes department of city police.

A memorial service was held for Bhatti on
Saturday at the Islamic Mosque on Bigelow
Boulevard in North Oakland. Over 100
friends, relatives and members of the local
Islamic community gathered to mourn the
loss of Bhatti. He was buried Saturday after-
noon in Homewood Cemetery in
Pittsburgh’s East End.

Mahboob Shahid Bhatti, Atif Bhatti’s
uncle from Allentown, said at the service
that the incident can serve towam people
about the dangers of excessive alcohol con-
sumption.

“He had a very bright future ahead of him.
All of his grades were excellent,” he said. “It
is the tragedy of our life that one simple mis-
take proved so fatal.”

“It can be an eye-opener for youngsters
who are sitting here, to stay away from this
substance which can be so fatal,” Mahboob
Shahid Bhatti said.

In a letter to Pitt students, faculty and staff
dated Friday, Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor expressed his concern about the

incident and overuse of alcohol by students.

“We know that there are serious risks
associated with alcohol consumption, and I
strongly urge you to be more responsible in
a direct and personal way to help your peers
and colleagues when there is evidence of
excessive alcohol consumption,” O’Connor
said.

According to the letter and Haley, the uni-

versity began establishing a campus-wide

alcohol abuse task force last week.

“I obviously consider this a priority
for this campus, and I particularly see it
as a quality of student life issue if we
are to avoid future needless losses
such [as] Mr. Bhatti, or other serious impair-
ments to the health of students,” O’Connor
said.

Haley said Bhatti’s death serves as an

ominous sign that the dangers of excessive

alcohol consumption are present every-
where.

“We -are all deeply affected by this,”
Haley said on Friday. ‘This is a tragedy we
are all sharing in.”

“We know there’s [an alcohol] problem.
There’s a problem on all college campuses,”
Haley said. ,

“It’s a terrible tragedy. What a waste,”
Boyd said. “Anybody who does not think
alcohol is a deadly drug is kidding them-
selves.”

beat dads, he said. But only
one-ﬁfth of all women receive
child support duly, he said.

“Does this sound like a black
problem?’i Reed asked.

Local news broadcasts air
problems in the black commu-
nity more than those in the
white community, he said.

“I’m sure we have local TV
news here that at 11 p.m. starts
off with black crime,” he said.
“The dirty laundry of the
African American community
is the only dirty laundry that’s
aired.”

I The media uses black men as

scapegoats the way the Nazis
pinned blame to the Jews, he

‘ said. Since the media are pow-

erful and have more resources,
African Americans must use
writing to force open the
debate.

“We’re up against Rome’——
the media are Rome,” he said.

Reed has written l5 books,
two of which have been nomi-
nated for National Book
Awards. His book of poetry,
“Conjure,” was nominated for
a Pulitzer Prize.

Reed read from his latest
novel “Japanese By Spring” in

‘ which the main character, a

black professor without tenure.
teaches at a university
entrenched in a race war
between blacks and whites.

When the Japanese buy the
campus, the new Japanese
president of the school asks the
professor for his help in mak-
ing changes on campus.

The Japanese president
wants to close down the
Humanities Department and
teach Ethnic Studies instead.
The school already has African
Studies and Asian Studies, says
the new president. Now the
school will have European
Studies and give it the same
budget as the other ethnic stud-
ies departments.

Putting down his book, Reed
spoke about Japanese attitudes
toward African Americans. He
said many Japanese hold a
“naive racism” toward blacks
because the two do not have
much Contact with each other.

More black people should
visit Japan and other countries
to combat the “sophisticated
anti-black propaganda”
brought in by the television
media, Reed said.

When a member of the audi-
ence asked Reed, “How close

. did we come to making it in the

‘60s?” he responded that a
change in consciousness
occurred but “your generation
can do more.” Today, young
people have more resources
because they can now commu-
nicate in computer cyberspace,
he said.

Opinions

No mandate

Well, the dust has settled on the 1994 elections. Many have
hailed this election as the triumph of conservatism over liber-
alism, or the demise of President Bill Clinton and the
Democratic Party and the re-emergence of the Republican
Party. This analysis, while it may seem intuitively correct, is
in part inaccurate and is tremendously oversimplified.

The catalyst for this tremendous shift is far more complicat-
ed than the American people finally discovering the “correct-
ness” of the Republican Party. It was only two years ago
when the tremendous demand for change resulted in the victo-
ry of Bill Clinton pver George Bush.

Clinton has brought some change, but not all of the change
the American people desire. He has not brought health care
for everyone that demands no sacrifices. He hasnot brought
tax reductions without a decline in the benefits provided by
the government. He has not eliminated the crime problem in
this country without increasing government spending on
crime reduction. Do these seem like impossible and somewhat
contradictory goals? That is because they are 4 yet they are
what the American people truly desire.

Furthermore, the Republicans have hailed this election as a
message against big government. What exactly is big govern-
ment, you may ask? That is a good question. The Republicans
would have you believe it is anything the Democrats are in
favor of and most forms of social spending. But what about
increases in military spending? What about huge increases in
scientific spending such as the space station or the supercon-
ducting supercollider? What of a “moral mandate” from the
government? These are certainly forms of big government,
but the Republicans say that these increases in government
are OK. Well, they may be, they may not be. The point is the
Republicans are hardly against big government. They are
merely against forms of government spending they do not
like. ,

To insinuate that the American people are against big gov-
ernment is an even greater inaccuracy. They are very much in
favor of a government which would provide health care,
social security, a super—powerful military, college loans, a
safer society and an entire list of other government opera-
tions. The problem is the people want these things, but they
want them without an increase in taxes and without further
intrusion in their lives. Well, all of these things would be nice,
but they are virtually impossible to achieve without sacrifice,
and the decision needs to be made whether or not each sacri-
fice is worth the benefit. However, this decision is not being
made by the people of this country.

What the people desire is a panacea. Unfortunately, this is
something neither the Republicans nor the Democrats can
provide. This is something Bill Clinton, the Democratic Party
and George Bush have discovered. Bob Dole and Newt
Gingrich will soon receive their lesson.

n last
w e e k ’ s
mid-term

elections, the
Republican
P a r t y
regained
control of
Columnist both houses
Tony of the
Dickensheets Congress for

the first time
in 40 years. How they
accomplished what some are
calling the “Republican
Revolution of 1994” is a
matter of who one listens to.

 

The spin doctors for the.

Democratic Party have spun
a tale which says that the
huge number of incumbents
thrown out of office was
merely due to voter anger
that manifested itself in a
“throw-the-bums-out move-
ment.” The problem with this
thesis is that the only bums
who were thrown out of
office were Democrats. The
Republican Party had all of
its incumbent members of
Congress re-elected.

The mid—term elections
were a referendum on not
only the Clinton administra-
tion, but on liberalism
as well. And the results show
a resounding mandate from
the American people for
the government to get off
our backs. This election
was about the American
people demanding that
the government assume
a much smaller role in

the lives of individual
Americans and for our
elected representatives

to stop taxing and regulating
us to death. It seems to
me that there are two man-
dates that the American
people gave to Congress
to accomplish, one having
to do with economic policy
and the other with social pol-
icy.

One of the statements at
the top of the list in the
“Contract With America”

was that this nation must
have a Constitutional amend-
ment which requires the gov-
ernment to maintain a bal-
anced budget. The first step
that the 104th Congress will
take is to look at which pro-
grams and subsidies can be
cut or ‘eliminated.
Everything, except Social
Security, is on the table for
possible cuts. The govern-
ment is full of waste that can
be cut along with such pro-
grams as Medicaid and
Medicare. In addition to
spending cuts, look for some
broad-based middle-class tax
cuts along with a bill that
will give the president a line-
item veto for the budget.

The second overwhelming
mandate that the American
peoplegave to Congress is to
move radically away from
the 1960s social liberalism
which the Clinton adminis-
tration, Democrats and col-
lege campuses have been
pushing down the throats of
the American people for too
long. The electorate sent a
powerful message that they
want this throwback to the
‘60s Great Society programs
to end immediately. The lib-
erals have had the opportuni-
ty to test their thesis of solv-
ing all of society’s problems
through government inter-
vention and throwing money
at the “oppressed.”

The liberal “solution” has
failed miserably, and those
days are about to end. All
forms .of violent crime are
up, welfare dependency has
increased, illegitimacy has
skyrocketed because of gov-
ernment welfare programs
which pay young girls to
have babies. The social fab-
ric of this nation has been
frayed to its limits because
of bleeding-heart liberals
whose programs have
trapped many blacks and
other minorities in an inner-
city underclass by telling
them that they can’t succeed

  Election gives Republicans a mandate

because of “racism” or
“oppression.”

Welfare should not be an
occupation. It should be
available to those in need
and then only temporarily.
Too many people in this
country only know about
their “rights” and have com-
pletely forgotten that along
with rights come responsibil-
ities. Welfare has created a
class of addicts dependent on
government handouts and it
is time for it to end. The tax-
payers cannot be made to pay
for the support of able-bod-
ied people. If given the
option of working or starv-
ing, I’ll bet that most of them
will work. It’s time for the
government to give that ulti-
matum.

The American people also
want Congress to crackdown
on crime. They are tired of
our revolving-door justice
system which continually
lets violent repeat predators
out on our streets after serv-
ing a short jail term in which
they were supposedly “reha-
bilitated.” Clinton’s crime

bill is a farce and everybody ~

knows it. It would take a fool
to believe that rapists, mur-
derers and drug dealers will
stop everything in order to
play a game of midnight bas-
ketball.

Maybe the liberal estab-
lishment is that stupid, but
the real America isn’t. It is
time to take the Playboy
channel away from the crimi-
nals and make them work for
their living. Those that are
rapists and murderers should
be exterminated so that
America’s schools, parks and
streets can be enjoyed by the
people’, not the predators.

If Clinton is looking for a i

new campaign slogan for
‘96, I’d like to suggest this
one: “Liberalism is Dead,
Stupid!”

Jells, a
victim of
the system

ietrich
J ells.
The

    

Columnist long bombs and
Brett big plays. But
Fondrk maybe I should
say that it was
associated with the big play.

J ells, who was once one of
the top receivers in nation, has
had an average year.

Let’s look at what he’s
accomplished in the past. In his
magical season of 1992, he set
a Pitt and Big East record when
he amassed 1,091 yards. His 55
receptions that year are a
school record. He tied a Pitt
record for the longest pass play
in a season when he caught a
91-yard bomb against Rutgers.
For his efforts, he was named
to the Football News first team
sophomore All—America squad,
second—team A1l—Big East team
and to the ECAC All-Star
team.

At the outset of the ‘93 sea-
son, Athlon magazine had him
rated as the ninth-best receiver
in the country.

This year, with one game
remaining, he has 31 receptions
for 565 yards and four touch-
downs. These less-than—gaudy
numbers rate him fourth in the
Big East.

So how could a player so tal-
ented put up such average
numbers?

He is a victim of the system.
A victim of the John Majors
system.

At the beginning of the year
he wasn’t even starting. He was
a back—up to Curtis Anderson.
Anderson has eight catches on

- the season.

But to his credit, Jells was a
consummate professional about
the situation. He didn’t whine
to the press or give half efforts,
he simply waited for his
chance.

And when it came, he
responded in a big way. Most
of his yards have come in the
past few games, as Majors has
finally let the star shine. John
Ryan has connected with Jells
on a number of long pass plays.
The two hooked up against
West Virginia five times for
220 yards and two touchdowns,
which set a Pitt single-game
record. Jells is clearly the best‘
receiver on the roster and is
unarguably one of the most tal-
ented players on the team. He
is a viable touchdown threat
every time he steps on the
field.

My question is, why did
Majors hold one of his
weapons in check until late in

Pitt hangs tough with Miami, loses l7-l2

By Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

The last thing Miami expect-
ed to see from Pitt was a 6-
foot-3-inch, 305-pound tackle
lining up in the backfield on a
crucial fourth—and—one situa-

down, but
in the
end, the
u p s e t —
minded Panthers and their
trick plays fell to the No. 5
Hurricanes 17-12 in the rain-
drenched Orange Bowl on
Saturday.

Pitt had the ball in Miami
territory late in the game, but
lost the ball on downs, and
therefore the game, with 59
seconds left.

This ruined what could have
been a fairy-tale ending for
Pitt, which fell to 2-8 and 1-5
in conference.

“I just don’t see how I could
be any prouder of a team’s
effort,” head coach John
Majors said. “Nobody in our

For the fifth year in a row,
the Pitt volleyball team has
won or shared the regular sea-
son title in the Big East.

The Lady Panthers will

‘ share this
season’s
title with

Hall and
UConn.
 Based
on conference tie-breaking
procedures, Seton Hall was
awarded the top seed in next
weekend’s Big East tourna-
ment, which they will also be
hosting. ,

Pitt earned the third seed for
the tournament and will face
second seed UConn next
Saturday afternoon in one of
two semifinal matches.

However, despite a success-
ful regular season in which the
team went 18-10 overall and
7-1 in the Big East, the Lady
Panthers finished their season
this weekend by dropping two
out of three at the Virginia
Tech Tournament.

“We started three different
lineups this weekend,” head
coach Cindy Alvear said. “We
hit a real high point in the sea-
son when we played
Providence and Seton Hall,
and we really haven’t played
to that level since then. We’re
doing everything we can in
practice to get the girls back to

came close. We thought we
could win.”

With 7:43 left on its own 20,
Pitt had a chance.

“The sideline was electric,”
Majors said. “It was so excit-
ing you had to try to contain it
to some degree without trying
to put cold water on it.”

rebounded by hitting Chad
Askew for three yards the next
play.

On a crucial fourth-and-four,
Ryan found Billy Davis for six
yards and a first down at the
Miami 35. Patton then rum-
bled for two more yards, but
Pitt was flagged for a false
start.

Ryan hit Dietrich Jells for
eight yards, but after two
incompletions, Miami took
over on downs at its 38 with
59 seconds left in the contest.

The drive fell 38 yards short
of what would have been the
biggest upset in college foot-
ball this season.

Despite the defeat, Majors
was proud of his team.

“It’s the most encouraging
effort that we’ve had in two
years,” he said.

And for the Panthers, there
was a lot to be encouraged
about when you consider what
they accomplished.

They were 32-point under-
dogs and were not given much

of chance to score, let alone

have a chance to win.

 Trees Pool.
The Pitt women beat Clarion,
but lost to OSU and UVa.»

To give you an idea of how
tough the men’s competition
was, Matt Brady broke the
longest standing Pitt men’s
record in the l,650—meter
freestyle. He covered the
mile distance in 15:28.37,
breaking a mark set in 1977,
but he only finished third
behind a pair of swimmers
from Virginia in the race.

“We looked good on paper
against all of these teams,”
Jonti Bacharach said. “We
knew we could beat Virginia
and we knew it would come
down to the last few events
against Ohio State. It’s just
unfortunate that we couldn’t
get them.”

OSU beat Pitt 142-101, but

crushed outclassed Clarion Brady captured the

Panthers’ only other two
overall swimming firsts, with
wins in the 200 individual
medley and 200 backstroke.
But he’s most proud of the
1,650 record.

“It’s not my best event,” he
said, “but to be able to say
that I broke a school record,
it’s an honor.”

Diver John Soulakis won
the three-meter and finished
second in the one-meter for
the Panthers.

Eric Stull finished third in
the 50-meter freestyle, and
Chris Perry finished third in

141-86.

“They’re both real strong
teams,” Brady said. “Ohio
State is top 15-top 20 in the
nation. Virginia is also there,
and that’s where we’re head-
ed.” »

Bacharach headed the
Panthers’ efforts with overall
wins in the 100- and 200-

off the second-place 400-
meter freestyle relay team for
the Panthers.

the 200 i.m. for Pitt.

Separating the Panthers
from the Buckeyes in the
meet was OSU’s depth. They
consistently placed two
swimmers in the top three
places, even in the Panthers’
strongest events.

“They’ve got depth in all
the events that we’re good
at,” head coach Chuck
Knoles said. “In everything
that we’re good at, they’re
good at.”

While the men thought they
had a strong shot on paper
against OSU and UVa., the
young women’s team knew
when they looked at the
schedule that they didn’t hold
much of a shot at beating
either team.

“We knew the outcome
before we started,” Christy
Knobloch said. “They’re both
top 25 schools, and we didn’t
expect to win against either
one of them.”

Pitt lost to Virginia 137-
102, and OSU 140-103, but
stifled Clarion 161-77.

“We pretty much
just focused on beating
Clarion heartily, which
we did,” Vicki Geubtner
said, “and trying to hang

in there with Virginia and
Ohio State as best we could.”

The Panthers’ best was
diver Sunday Lewandowski,
who finished first in both the
one- and three-meter diving.
Kara Sixbury also dove well,
with a third in the three-
meter and a fourth in the one-
meter. Geubtner led a trio
of Panthers’ swimmers in the
50 free. She finished third
overall, just ahead of Isabel
Dejo and Alicia Tymes.
Geubtner also finished third
in the 100 free. Dejo fol-

» lowed her fourth in the 50

free with a fifth in the 100
free.

Knobloch was third in the
200 butterfly, followed by
Jenny Doran in fourth. Erin
Bissell came in fourth in the
200 breaststroke.

“We had a lot of lifetime
bests, which is amazing for
the way we’ve been getting
our butts kicked in practice,”
Geubtner said.

The Panthers didn’t place
much stock in the outcomes
of Saturday’s meets.

“Right now, all we have to
worry about is getting up and
racing the person next to us,”
Knobloch said.

in the third match, we had
another lineup in and we did
not play great, but we seemed
to rally, so I’ve just got to
finalize what we are going to
do for the Big East [tourna-
ment].”

Friday afternoon Pitt played
Arkansas State and was swept
15-12, 15-12 and 15-8. The
Lady Panthers found them-
selves in a familiar situation on
Saturday afternoon when
George Mason swept them as
well by the scores of 15-11,
15-13 and 15-1.

The Lady Panthers did
redeem themselves on
Saturday night by defeating
tournament host Virginia Tech
10-15, 15-9, 15-11 and 16-14.

One bright spot for Pitt this
weekend was senior middle
hitter Melanie Gustafson, who
earned All—Tournament team
honors. Over the three games
Gustafson had 33 kills, includ-
ing 18 against Virginia Tech.

“She was our most consistent
performer,” Alvear said.
“Melanie was definitely offen-
sively very strong and people
notice that, and she was the
most consistent offensive per-
former on the team this week-
end.”

Next weekend’s Big East
Tournament is a major one for
the Lady Panthers if they hope
to maintain their goal of mak-
ing it to the NCAA tourna-
ment. Unless the team wins the
Big East Tournament, which
would give them an automatic
bid to the NCAAs, then they
will be forced to play in the
National Invitational
Volleyball Tournament.

“I don’t know if we would
take the NIVT invitation,”
Alvear said. “I’ve already had
correspondence with them as
we do every year, because you
don’t want to put all your eggs
in one basket.”

Alvear has no doubts that the
team will be ready for next
weekend and the goal at hand.

“At this point in the season,
you are not going to change a
lot of things,” she said. “You
just have to be at a peak men-
tally and emotionally, and I
think we will be ready.”

the season? Jells could easily
be an Eric Metcalf type of
player who strikes fear into the
hearts of opposing defenses.

The last thing a defense
wants to face is a strong run-
ning attack which is compli-
mented by a deep threat who
can beat them for 90 yards in
one play.

If Majors would have
thought about this from the
first game, maybe Pitt
wouldn’t be 2-8. Using Jells as
a featured offensive player is
too little, too late, in a season
that has been an absolute mess.

Let’s hope that next year,
someone wakes up and utilizes
the talent that Pitt has to its
advantage. If he is used as he
should be, Jells has the ability
to be one of the top receivers
in the nation.

Miami
°Fr0m page 7
vaunted ‘Cane defense off bal-
ance all day, as Majors used
Brown in the backfield on a
number of occasions, as well
as a three-way split formation
that Majors calls “hully-gully

football.”

“Pittsburgh came out to play
today,” Miami linebacker Ray
Lewis said. “They ran some
trick plays and did some good
things on offense. They had
time to prepare for us, and it
showed with some of the
effective things that they did.”

The Miami defense had
problems with West especially,
as he shredded the ‘Canes for

160 yards on 34 carries. It was
the first time this season a
back has gained 100 yards
against Miami.

Ryan, who was the top rated
passer in the Big East confer-
ence, was 10 of 17 for 68
yards and a touchdown. The
TD pass marked the first time
in 18 quarters that a team had
scored against the Hurricane
defense.

Despite giving up 309 yards
in the air, the Pitt defense bent
but didn’t break as they kept
the game close. Its effort was
spearheaded by cornerback
Denorse Mosley, who picked
off Miami quarterback Frank

Costa twice. John Jenkins also
recovered a fumble.

Pitt actually had the lead in
the contest in the first quarter.

Following the first of
Mosley’s picks, Pitt drove 39
yards, a drive which culminat-
ed in a 37-yard field goal by
David Merrick.

Miami took the ball 78 yards
on the ensuing possession. The
drive ended in a touchdown
when fullback Danyell
Ferguson ran the ball in from
one yard out to give Miami a
7-3 lead at 9:23 in the first
quarter.

Mosley’s interception in the
second quarter set up another
