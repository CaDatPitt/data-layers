Sophs To0ltlT1il°IIcfully    

By Irene Long

Well, pards, it was sophfu,l.,for the
rest of the classes, but it was indu-
bitably swell on Friday for the sopho-
mores. ‘They won the annual Inter-
class Sing!

With “Sophomore Joe” (Mary Jane
Patterson), 21 rootin’, tootin’, cigar
waving candidate on the platform, and
standing on such planks as “a chicken
pie in every Mrs. Lane’s lunchbox,
profs like Clark Gable, post-graduate
pensions instead of diplomas, roller
skating to classes,” and whatnot, they
were the indisputable winners of the
Sing. - e '

The renowned candidate pounded
and shouted (in her; modest little’
voice), “My friends (Harrumph, har-
umph, gurgle) we face a crisis!“ She
then went on to attack the frivolous
policies, formalities, and traditions of
the freshmen, juniors, and seniors. At
intervals the entire class yelled; {.‘Cap-
italists! Monofiolists! _’R_.egimen£a'tor !
Plutocrats !” and excitedly shook their

c_....-.'.... ..

To  Sing .:.;Trophy

fists to give punch to the candidate's

-electioneering. One of the highlights

of the skits was Mary Lee Nicholson
sle’w-footing around in overalls and a
red sweater with a bandanna slung
around her neck and a bomb in one
hand. Verily, verily, and a couple of
more verilies, the sophomore spirit,
skits, and songs were swell!-

They tell me, that the idea’ for the
sophomore’s skits originated with a
young lady named Edith Stewart. As
to_ the-‘ other classes, they, too, were
quite original as to songs and skits.
The“ seniors, who placed second with
Betty _ Wainwright impersonating
Chancellor Bowman, snuk up on Eda
Gfupen who was Andrew Mellon and
touched himlfor some money to build
the Cathedral. The whole skit con-
cerned the’hist‘or_v of the Cathedral,
and had WEA workmen trotting in
andcout with shovels and picks, not
to mention some Knock‘. Knocks!

The Juniors had a pedagogic parade

Wanted: $15,000

IT HAS been learned that the Athletic Council has decided
against sending the band to the Rose Bowl game. It is with re-
gret that students seek support elsewhere, but then it must be
agreed that the bondholders, those gentlemen who hold the Sta-
dium bag, so to speak, must be satisﬁed.

It is difficult to understand why there should be an insistent
demand on the part of the same bondholders, especially when con-
sideration is given the manner in which the Pitt bid was forwarded.
Earlier in the season when the Dukes outscored the Panthers,
there was -little hope for Rose Bowl honors. How then, anyone
could plan or anticipate a Rose Bowl bid is just plain tough to see.

Pitt’s bid came out of a blue Paciﬁc sky. It was a great bid
for Dr. Sutherland’s ﬁghting squad. The returns should net any-
where from $50,000 to $100,000. Yet there was not $15,000 with
which to send the band west. The bondholders must be paid off
was the cry.

Now the smooth way to handle the band situation was through
the athletic council. Yet, they refused more than moral support.

So the band must go outside the University to seek its sponsor.
Permission has been granted, it has again been learned upon au-
thority, to solicit outside aid, for everyone readily admits that the
band would do much for a University at such an event.

We can only wait to see the success of the students attempting
to collect the necessary funds in this manner. Good luck, boys,
the undergraduates are with you one hundred per cent.

A Public Menace

TONIGHT in this city a public burial will be held for an uni-
dentiﬁed man killed by a hit-and-run driver, believed to have
been under the inﬂuence of liquor.

The burial has been made public as a protest against drivers
of automobiles who, despite rigid enforcement of the law, continue
their ﬂagrant violations of that law by driving in an intoxicated
condition.

Men most prominent in the campaign to wipe out this menace
of safety are far from prohibitionists themselves. However, they
do recognize and admit that an automobile driver in an intoxicated
state cannot have the alert reactions so necessary to driving under
normal conditions. Liquor leaves some people in various stupyﬁng
states, while others are irrational in their ideas, actions and judg-
ments.

Every University in the country should go on record as sup-
porting every attempt to insure safety to automobile riding and
driving. We, too, should protest the circumstances which led to
the death of that unidentiﬁed man and be resolved that we will

c-—-..—._... .r......—

campaign by strict adherence to the automobile code.

Th ree Christmas
Pa rt ies Planned

 

It looks as though the ﬁve and dime
stores will do a landslide business this
week. Panhellenic Council, Cwens, and
the Italian Club are all holding Christ-
mas parties within the next few days,
and all will exchange ten cent gifts.

Members of Penhellenic Council will
have their Christmas party at the
Ti-i—De1t house on Bigelow Boulevard
tomorrow evening at 7:30 o’clock.

Besides the exchange of gifts,
Marian Messer, C37, social chairman,
h.as planned games for the entertain-
ment of the representatives of the 15
women's fraternities on campus. Re-
freshments will also be served.

The Italian Club is also swapping
presents at their party which will be
held at the same time as the Panhel
party. Every member of the Italian
Club and their guests are to bring
a ten—cent article to their party which
will be in Room 1309, Cathedral.

A grab bag ﬁlled with ten-cent gifts
will be the main attraction of the
Cwen party, scheduled for Thursday
evening at Heinz House. Games and
refreshments will add to the Cwens’
entertainment.

Send-Off

occurs. Great enthusiasm has met
all requests for support thus far so-
licited.

Student opinion is unanimous in
backing the move to send the band
west; all representative ctivities on
campus have expressed their approval
of the venture.

Sponsoring the mass meeting Wed-
nesday evening, which will give the
student body the last chance to see
the football team and, probably, the
band until after Pitt’s fourth chance
at a Rose Bowl victory on January 1,
1937, are The News, College Asso-
ciation and SFA. Things will begin
to hum at the Pennsylvania terminal
about 6 o’clock.

 

Describes Travels

 

Dr. Stephan Jarosz, Poland's most
famous explorer, will describe h-is
travels in Alaska and Poland tonight
before the Polish Intercollegiate
Club. The meeting will be held at
the International Institute, 405 South
Dithridge street.

Medical Freshmen

Members of the freshman class of
the School of Medicine chose officers
for the next year at an election held
last Wednesday. The new officers are:
Courtland D. Leigh, president; Rich-
ard H. Horn, vice-president; J. C. Me-
lassonos, secretary; James R. Hoon,
treasurer.

(Ed. Note: This is the fourth

in a series of articles concerning

"the history of the University. Next

' semester the sesquicentennial anni-

versary will be officially observed

by a ﬁtting celebration, plans for
which are already under way.)

Blocking oil’ the space between the
Fifth avenue entrance and the elevator
lobby has given the Cathedral work-
men an opportunity to continue undis-
turbed the job of creating the Com-
mons Room.

According to John Weber, secretary
of the University’, the room will be
completed by May 1, in time for the
celebration of the sesquicentennial an-
niversary.

“Planned in the Gothic style of art,
the room will provide a place where
students may meet with their friends,”
Mr. Weber declared.

Conceived about 1926, the Commons
Room has undergone an evolution in
design in the hands of ‘ the architect
.of the, Cathedral, C. C. Klauder, who
has been connected with the archi-
tectural planning at Princeton, Yale,
Wellesley, Columbia, and Penn State.

According to the report of Chan-
cellor John G. Bowman to the trustees
of the University for the biennium
1934-1936, the Commons Room is “the
last major construction operation in
connection with the Cathedral of
Learning. ' ~ ~

ARTIST’S SKETCH OF COMMONS ROOM SCENE

ers an area of approximately half an

acre. The walls are to be of Indiana

Limestone.”

In commenting on the spirit and
principle underlying the room, Dr.
Bowman remarks in his review:

“Let us assume now tnat the Com-
mons Room is ﬁnished and that the
boy leaves the sidewalk and enters
the room. Floors and walls are stone.
In the dim light overhead, he sees
the stone vaulted ceiling. There is a
strength about this room that for a
moment dwarfs him. ‘But vaguely,
somewhere deep in him, he has a feel-
ing of importance that is hard to de-
ﬁne. Is it rhythm? Or has he walked,
as it seems, into an invocation. .

“ ‘What is college like?’ he wants to
know. From the dim vaulted ceiling,
from arches reaching up and up, from
the strength of pillars comes the an-
swer, but not in words. He is some-
what a stranger to himself. He is al-
most what he wants to be. College is
not a dream, but it seems like one. It
seems like the sum of all dreams in
which he is trusted and respected. It
is a prelude to some kind of great liv-
ing.”

ment, it has achieved one of the most
outstanding debating records in the
country. It publicizes its debating

ington University and Pennsylvania

tively. A team from Bucknell Univer-
sity will oppose members of the Asso-
ciation sometime in April. V

week-end of March 12 when a Univer-
sity squad participates in a debating
conference at Penn State. March 18

State debaters a second time at State
College. The following day they will
fill an engagement at Bucknell.

The week after that will ﬁnd the
debaters journeying west. On March
22 they are scheduled to‘- meet a squad
from Denison College at Granville,
Ohio. Ohio Wesleyan University of
Delaware, Ohio, and Capital Univer-
sity. of Columbus will oppose them on
