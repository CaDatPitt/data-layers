Author Vance Packard to Speak  
 At SUB Public Affairs -orum

The Student'Union Board Lecture Series is presenting
Vance Packard, one of America’s most popular authors of
social criticism this Wednesday at 12 noon in the Student
Union Ballroom. His speech is entitled “America in Up-

heavel.”

Packard ﬁrst came to be noticed on a national level with
the publication of his ﬁrst book, Th‘e Hidden Persuaders,

which was a study of the techniques of motivational re-_

search. The -book emphasized the applications of these tech-
niques in two areas, advertising and political campaigns.
His second book was entitled The Status Seekers, a
study of class stratiﬁcation in the United States; The Stu-
dent Union Public Affairs Committee plans to follow up this
topic with a panel discussion on “Social Climbers at Pitt” to
be held the following day at 12 noon in the Student Union
Supper Room. The panel will consist of_ three undergrad-

Let Us Regress Together

I The tone of the Ford Foundation-sponsored Wells’ re-
port, released last week, recommendsinevitable, but never-
theless despicable, academic regression.’ .
' ' Its major conclusion is: “In the_ opinion of _the Com-
_mittee the University has revamped its ﬁscal attitude suf-
*ﬁcient1y to prompt the encouragement and support of the
community. The Committee, therefore, calls upon the civic
leaders of Pittsburgh to assist the rebirth of the Universi-
..ty’.s promise by sponsorship of a special bootstrap cam-

.:to the Pittsburgh community. The call, however, must either
appeal primarily towards the wealthy private community
leaders or the community-at-large. _ _

Attempts have been made to -tap the few important
wealthy community leaders to support the University. At-
tempts have failed and have aggravated the need to move
-towards ‘a closer state affiliation. The Wells’ report, how-
-ever, reasons that if the community is aware that the Uni-
versity will be taking more local and in-state students the
elite will unlock their vaults and dole out globs of money.
? Unfortunately, this is a regression from an academic
Jpoint of view. When the University was originally develop-
ing, the program was community-based. The undergraduate
school of business administration, for example, served as a
,quick training ground for prospective local young execu-
tives. Also, the Cathedral itself was built, in part, by a local
‘fund-raising campaign where one could buy a brick for one
dollar.
" ' In recent years there was the Litchﬁeld trend toward
increasing private status with a corresponding increase in
academic freedom, releasing the University from depen-
dence on Bittsburgh’s elite of wealthy families.

Now, says the Ford report, regress. Their rationale is

academic regression where a private institution concerned
with academic pursuits will be directed _towards the mass

Play Against West -Virginia E

By JAY ROSENSTEIN

University Park, Jan. 22,
1966.——West Virginia crosses
the state line to meet the
hoopsters here tomorrow
night but you can be sure
that ‘Mountaineer coach
Bucky Walters isn’t looking
forward to the trip as much as
he was two days- ago.

The Panthers changed the
thinking of a lot of people when

a they narrowly missed defeating
3 Penn State last Saturday in Uni-

Lu"-

versity Park.

Penn State students, some 5,-
500 of them, came to the game
fully expecting a Lion rout. They
clapped to the music of “Sweet
Georgia Brown” during the pre-
game drill. They roared when
Carver Clinton imitated Meadow-'
lark Lemon of the Harlem Globe-
trotters.

But they didn't roar once the
game got under way. They didn’t
even breathe easy ‘until the ﬁnal
12 seconds of the contest. It was
then that Clinton clinched a 66-62
Penn State victory with two foul-
shots. -

‘ “It was the best team effort of
the year,” said Panther coach
Bob Timmons after the game.
“For the ﬁrst time we put to-
gether two halves and played
our ball game.” A

The hoopsters riddled the Lions’
2-3 zone defense to perfection.'
“We looked for»the open man

and made them come to us,” ‘

added Timmons.

“If we had been ahead in the
last two minutes, they would

have had to foul"us. That made‘

the difference.”

The hoopsters had the lead at’
halftime, 38-36, in a game that
was tied 15 times. Led by Bob
Lovett, the Panther offense hit_
64 per cent from the ﬂoor in that
ﬁrst half. The hoopster guards,
Larry Szykowny and Stan Fal-
enski, found Lovett open for 13
points of his 21 point total. .

There‘ were however, several
key turning points in the second.
half that shifted the momentum
to Penn State. Lion coach John
Egli felt that when his 6-9 cen-
ter Paul ‘ll/iickey stuﬂed an at-

tempted layup by Jim LaValley,:
the tide turned.

Timmons, partly agreed. “That
was still early in the second
half,” he said. “I though the real
turning point came when Lovett
,missed a layup that would have
put us four points up with ﬁve
minutes to go.

‘After Lovett’s shot rolled off

and opened up a 64-58 lead. Yet
the cagers fought back to 64-62,

two free throws clinched it.

the rim, Penn State came alive-

still ringing in his ears after
Kent State ﬁnished-off the

In many of the events, the
trackmen went along ‘with that
old adage, “It doesn’t matter
whether you win or lose, .but it’s-
how you play the game that
counts.” How the track team
played it, however, did not count
in the ﬁnal tabulations.

The wrestling match with

inost of the matmen coming away
 a distinctly sick feeling.
 The ,matmen’s lone points came
from Dino Boni’s 2-1 decision of
Dicgklll/ﬁles. The meet started off
on an ominous tone when Gary
Burger pinned Tony Liberati at
123 in the ﬁrst period. From that
point on, with the exception of
Bani, the results became a little
monotonous. A
“Most of the guys just didn't
ut out," said Johnson. “If you
d_on’t shoot the whole match
then you don't stand a chance

meet.”
..At' 130, Dick Shildt put up a
cod match with Pete Vander1ot-
ske losing, 9-6. Wayne Hicks, rim-
__eir-up last year at the nationals
1n"'the 137 pound division, pinned
ophomore Ron Schuchert.
“Schuchert gave him a rough
time in the ﬁrst period,” said
Johnson. “He did better than I
{expected considering the experi-
nce that Hicks has.”
Jim Rhone and Clair Riley
ere decisloned 15-7 and 8-5, re-
spectively. Tim Trax in the 167

strong performance considering
that his opponent had a draw
several weeks ago with Okla-
homa’s Greg Ruth, last year's
NCAA champion. _ ,
It was in the /upper weight di-
visions that Johnson had hoped

to gather some points and that '

was where he suﬂfered his big-
gest disappointment. Randy Kah-
lor and Jack Williams were both
pinned, while heavyweight Terry
Hoover lost a 14-2 decision.

“I didn’t realize that their
heavyweights were as good as
they were,” said Johnson.
