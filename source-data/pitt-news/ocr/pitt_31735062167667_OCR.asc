Eight Trustees and Chancellor
Wesley Posvar answered ques-
tions on the function of Trustees,
membership in the board of
Trustees, additional funds for the
University, and opening meetings‘
with the Board. On Wednesday
in an open meeting held in the
Common Facilities Building.

The trustees included: Holmes
Wolfe, lawyer and member of
the Education and Student Af-
fairs Committee, Dr. Peake, Po-
vost; William Rea, Chairman of
the Oliver Tryone Corp. and head
of the Trustees. Also present were
Judge Aldisert, judge of the U.S.
Court of Appeals; Robert Kirby,
President of Westinghouse, and
member of The Budget Audit
Committee; Edison Montgomery,
and Dean Pease.

The largest number of ques-

tions raised pertained to the role

of the trustees.

To Vic Willem’s question,

L “What does it mean to you to be

a member of the board'of Trus-

1 tee?,” Kirby answered simply, “A

heartbreaking experience.”
"Students should. be pleased

“ that people with_such broad ex-

perience and are devoting time.
to the running of the University,”

7 he added.

An open meeting of ‘the Fac-

Wednesday morning i-n the Ste-

" '  ven Foster Memorial social room.
‘ Dr. Max Lauffer, leader of the

discussion and ‘one of ” the key
members of theresearch commit-

five’ faculty members that about

involved determining exactly

Rea expresses his feeling as
“A distinct opportunity and obli-
gation to the community.”

Josh Chasen asked the Trus-
tees, “Given the background of
the Trustees here, how does this
represent the public trust?”

Rea stated that “Six members

‘are elected by the Alumni, 12
are state appointed. others are.

charter trustees elected by other

trustees, some of which hold their
office until they are seventy,

and some of which are elected

for five years.”

“A corporation’ director and a
lawyer are naturally endowed to
handle the matter of finance, etc,
but there should be more educa-
tors and a broader economic spec-
trum.” Posvar added.

Migrants, Black
  Both Exploited

by BOB GIN G
Staff Writer

Tuesday afternoon, A1 Rojas,
the representative of the Cali-
fornia Grape;-xWorkers, spoke be-
fore a smalllgrloup of students and
faculty in the SU Supper Room.
Rojas came to Pittsburgh fif_teen
months ago, and has worked as
the coordinator of the movement
here."

In his fifteen months as a.Pitts-
burgh resident, Rojas has been
subjectedto much violence, scorn,
and other harrassment, andmet
many discouragements. The ju's‘—“
tice of his cause, though, is what
has kept him going. Rojas said,

"that, “Many times in America,
-as we become more affluent, we

find it harder to bring home the
care of the improverished people.
. . . Migrant workers don’t have‘
any of the protection that indus-
trial workers have.”-

He gave many reasons for the-
sad plight of the Mexican mi-
grant-worker, and one of the most
effective reasons he used was
education. Rojas said that because
of_ the constant shifting of the mi-
grant workers, education is dif-
ficult to- get. ‘Our education sys-
tem is not setup on a migrant
basis, andthe onlyway that the
Mexicancan get his education is
byleaving his family.  , ' P

The problems are not alleviat-
ed by the employers, he said.

» “They feel that these people who

work for them are just tools.

' When a migrant worker is cheat-
-ed out of his wage . .

. I10 one

cares . . . people are being treat-

ed as a wasteful material.” Now, .

though, “For the first time there
is a determination by the people

themselves forftheir own destin- ,
‘ies." This, isthe movement.

_ Themovement, was founded in
1965 'by.Caesar Chavez, to fight
the inhuman treatment of the Mex-
ican-American migrant farmers.
The Method, chosen was a nation-

~ al boycott. This action has been
V more -A than successful, cutting

down by far morethan half the:

ed enough to show at the meet-
ing.

When asked, what would come
first —— money/making or educa-

educational values are immeas-

opinion that trusteeship is a “dis”-

One of the maintopics brought
up-by the audience was the ques-
tion of finances. Edison Mont-
-gomery, vice-Chancellor of Fi-

nance told the assembly that we
are about "twenty-ninth in the
nation in total endowments,
“and we should be first. I would
like to see the trustees get busy.”

One of the main points of dis-
content _for the past two years,
has been the openess of the trus-
tee meetings. Rea contended that
the trustees have made a tremen-

dous concession by allowing

of that death is to acquiesce in
the murder of a part of yourself.

I marched out of conviction:
conviction that all wars are bad,
and that one worse than most. In
no history class or history book
that I’ve ever come across have'I
ever learned of -a war that solved
all the problems it was intended
to solve without creating a lot of
new ones. — War eventually leads
to other wars. The U. S. is wasting
my father’s taxes and my friends’
lives. What little added “secur-
ity” we might gain by entrench-
ing a corrupt regime and contin-
uing a division of the Viet-
namese people in order to keep
Communists (and the North Viet-
namese are really nationalists
more than Communists) out of
power would not be worth the
cost in dollars alone, much less in
human lives and anguish, that we
have spent to date with neither vic-
tory nor loss.

 unexpected demonstration by militant leftists dis-
rjipted the fifteenth annual Pillsbury Bakeoff yesterday at
olyoke, Massachusetts. I

It was during the Cake Originality Contest that students
garrying signs such as “beat rugs not eggs” entered the
°itchens and took over the day’s events.

fgMark Rudd, seizing the microphone from Judge Betty
ocker, chastized the bakers for their “racist policies.”~-

V {Why should we use only egg whites?” queried the doughty
Rudd. _Yolks have been tossed aside for years. It’s time people
r:ea_liz‘ed that they have feelings the same as whites.”

ff’. Abbie Hoffman, adropout from the Duncan Hines Cul-
ipary College, cautioned that the fight against bakers was
' st beginning. _, »

“We must examine the society that permits such pressure-
cooker tactics. We must ask ourselves, what is the real func-

on of desert.” I

A The speeches were followed by an actual demonstration
9f..,—;yeast, a controversial weapon in the baker’s arsenal that
causes a bloated feelingjn innocent batters.

C, A group of reactionary White Thumbers tried to win the
tchens back, brandishing signs of “Flower Power” and “White
makes Right,” causing a full scale melee to erupt.

ed? his opinion, Vice President Agnew angrily snapped, “let

It has recently come to the attention of
those who make decisions in this University
that spectator sports here have declined great-
ly. In reviewing the problem, the adminis-
tration decided that it would be much too dif-
ficult to have the soccer team play at an ac-
cessible and spacious field (they now oc-
cupy the practice fields behind Trees Hall).
They also decided that football had too dif-
ficult a schedule to instill life into and “no-
body enjoys watching a loser, anyway.” Ac-
cordingly, the administration, in an aggre-
gate,’piece-meal facshion,” decided to set up
a new sport.

The game has initially been called “Open
Meeting with the Chancellor and some Trus-
tees.” .The name of the game will probably

cause many aspiring athletes to shun the game _

wihout reading the rules. Unfortunately,

. there are rules and they are quite interesting. ‘

The game consists of two teams, diametri-
cally apart in views and unable to communi-
cate or relate to each other. One team is cal-
led Them and consists of Chancellor Posvar;
some of his friends, called administrators;
and four of their" bosses, referred to as trus-

The Big Game

tees. They sit on the stage in the common
facilities auditorium and can be distinguish-
ed by their three-piece-suit uniforms. Oppos-
ing Them are the students,“ in the audience,
nicknamed Us. Leading the charge are those
“concerned students and faculty members,”
who sit in the audience and are uniformed in
whatever they slept in the night before.

The game begins with an alumni (prefer-
ably a bearded ex-student government presi-

, dent) officiating. A teaching fellow rises and

asks a trustee to define his position on the
board. Now here is where the game becomes
crucial. Hoping the trustee won’t answer the
question without making a fool of himself or
needing the aid of the chancellor, the spec-
tators sit on th edge of their seat. The trus-
tee states that he feels he is contributing to
the community and is aiding the “wonderful,
glorious youth” of this country to setp into
his shoes. The spectators laugh, Then turn red.
Its one point for Us.

Thus the games goes on. Fun isn’t it.

‘ For some reason very few spectators show-

ed up. I guess we all 1ose_.

Chancellor Turns Hippy;

Injures Bare Baby, Toe  

Wesley Posvar, Chancellor of the Univer-
sity, today, overcome with shame and remorse
what he described as “ a jive, typical ad-

, ministrative, hoax-like, response by the mem-

bers of —the University’s Board of.Trustees at

his All-University meeting held on Wednes- i_
‘day, has declared that he will forsake his posi-

tion and join the ranks of the “flower people.”

The Chancellor, dressed in cloroxed blue
jeans, a grass-stained t-shirt, a ROTC Cadet
jacket (withithe bottons cut off), and a char-
truse mod hat, with “Free Huey” and “Dick
Gregory for President” buttons pinned all over
it, stormed out of his office, saying he would
never return’.

“I’ve had enough of administrative mean-

ingless jargon, deception ‘of the poor students, ‘

and constant defense of people that I have no
respect for,” the former Administrater spat at
reporters in the front of the Cathedral.

He said that he felt he had been practi-

cing deception, and cloaking it in the folds of *

administrative red tape too long;

“My decision was not just brought about
by the Open meeting on Wednesday,” the one-

time corporation puppet continued, ‘.‘-it has

been brought about from dealing: with the
freaks controlling our educational system.”

The new leftist, his red-teased hair seem-
ingly flaming and the two-day stubble for a
proposed beard already bristling, told the re-
porters that he was personally going to write
an obscene letter to all the trustees, and that
he would burn his draft card tomorrow on the

Paul VI, fired nearly forty veterans of the

anyone would care. ‘

.As the Chancellor leftthe Cathedral, he
was so overcome by new meaning in life he
had-found, that emotionally weakend, he ac-
cidently dropped the “Get Out -of Vietnam”
sign that he was carrying; hitting his right
baby toe. In obvious pain, his only comment
was, “still not able to get used to not wearing
those damn establishment, shoes.” '

When a policeman came over to see if he
could aid the aging crusader, he looked up

sharply from his ever swelling-foot and said N

“Don’t touch me pig.” /

“I am joining the youth movement, Pos-
var said, “Because I am fed up with the val-
ues and wrong-doings inherent in our society.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar is reported to
be sueing any Journalists who say they in-
terviewed a man fitting-his description, but
acting and talking in a deranged,-and very
"atypical and anti-establishment state. “Imagine

know how to tease my hair.” He refused to

Letters To The Editor

Way Back

Editor,lThe Pitt News:

I believe that most of the prob-
lems of this university stem from
the inadequacy of the administra-
tion. In order _to function as a rel-
evant, integral part of the com-
munity, the university must have
capable administration. There-
fore, I feel it’s time for Jack
Critchfield to swallow his pride
and resign.

Athletics is another area which
suffers from poor management.
The -present coaching situation
must be critically reviewed. I sug-
gest that the athletic department
get rid of John Michelosen and
hire a competent coach, someone
like Dave Hart.

Sincerely,
A Concerned Student

The box office sale have begun
at the Nixon Theatre for the one
week engagement there, begin-
ning Nov. 3, of Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead, the ac-
claimed hit of London and winner
of both the Tony Award and the
Drama Critics’ Circle Award as
the best play of the New York sea-
son in 1968.

This is the robustly funny come-
dy written by Tom Stoppard, at
the age of 28, that immediately
raised him to the front rank of
playwrights of the English-speak-

@ing world—an ingenious piece of

taxidermy, it was called by one
critic, since Stoppard had imagin-
atively stuffed a pair of Shakes-
peare’s characters (Hamlet’s col-
lege cronies) with personalities
that Shakespeare hadn’t bothered
to fill out.

In Hamlet these echoing syco-
phants are such talk-alikes that
the king and queen, using them to
ferret out the cause of Hamlet’s
alarming moodiness, aren’t sure
which is which. Stoppard has tak-
en this as his cue to make Rosen-
crantz and Guildenstern into pro-
types of the “identity crisis” of
aimless, alienated modern youth.

i "always commanded by an estab-

._1ishment that leaves them puzzled

.' €5"as‘to what they’re supposed to do

and why, and constantly under a
premonition of some nameless
doom.

By Zllurtlm‘ H urtle

Sports Editor

Syracuse comes into the’Stadium tomorrow afternoon with

‘a squad that currently ranks right behind Penn State in the
East and the Orangemen are highly touted as perhaps the
strongest team physically that the Panthers have faced so far

‘ this season. Yet to hear Syracuse coach Ben Schwartzwalder
talk, you’d hardly think so. --   _,   ,  

, In his 21st year as coach of
the Orangemen, Schwartz-
-walder has produced seven _.
 ‘bowl teams, one national
I P . championship squad, four Lam- 
. bert trophy winners and 19
straight non-losing seasons.
His overall record at Syracuse
stands at 130-62-2.

Currently 3-2 on the season,
Schwartzwalder’s team nar-
rowly missed an upset of Penn
State two weeks ago. But de-
spite the strong performances of
his team, Mr. Ben isn’t doing .
any bragging. “We’ve lost
two games haven’t we?” he
‘ ~ - laments.

Uncle Ben almost makes me
, cry when I hear about the woes  I
facing the Orangemen this 
season. “How’s your injury sit- '
. AA uation coach,” asked one re- 
 porter at Tuesday’s press
gathering? “We hope to have
eleven players ready,” Sch-
wartzwalder/retorted.

“And how much does your offensive line average (in
weight),” queried another. “I really don’t know. I don’t pay
much attention to averages,” groaned the coach. “Our center
goes about 205.”

Pass the crying towel. The Syracuse offensive line aver-

senior veterans. The seventh is junior split end ‘Tony Gabriel,
the Orangemen’s finest pass receiver.

One brave reporter dared to venture off the subject of
‘the upcoming Panther game. He probed into the area of re-
4 cruiting, hinting at the trespassing of Pennsylvania schools into

‘ the New York territory. “What’s this got to do with the Pitt
game,” answered Schwartzwalder.

But alas, Mr. Ben finally got the kind of question he likes
to answer. “Who are your defensive tackles?” “Now that’s a
question,” answered Schwartzwalder. Don’t be so gentle, Ben.

, , Schwartzwalder look, the crunching ground game. Schwartz-

’ ‘walder’s teams have never been outrushed over the course of a
 . season and over the full 20 seasons of his reign, his teams have
’ . outrushed the opposition by more than 20,000 yards.

Incidentally, the Orange do have a passing attack. “It
varies from game to game,” explained the coach. “In the Penn
State game, we threw three or four times.”

Pursue Fourth Victory

by EVAN PATTAK

Number 44. A legendary number steeped in Syracuse foot-
ball tradition. There’s Jim Brown carrying a host of would-
be tacklers into the end zone. Ernie Davis slithers through the
line and leaves a half dozen opponents clawing at his heels.
Powerful Floyd Little overruns a tackle twice his size.

This year’s 44 is Rich Pan-
czyszyn, a second-string quar-
terback who gets most of his grid-
iron thrills vicariously. The de-
grading of that famous legend
might give you some idea of the
ebb in Coach Ben Schwartzwald-
er’s football tidal wave;

Not that Syracuse is a bad team;
the Orange is one of the East’s
best. But Schwartzwalder is never
satisfied with good. Of course,
when you’re trying to becomethe
fifth and head of Mt. Rushmore
as not-so-gentle Ben is, you must
pursue perfection.

That, however,» is one achieve-‘

ment that will evade Schwartz-
walder this season. Following a
one point squeaker over Iowa
State in the opener, the Orange
was whitewashed by a mediocre
Kansas team 13-0. Syracuse bounc-

Penn State. The Orange won
every category but scoring, los-
ing 15-14 after assuming a two
touchdown lead.

The Jekyll-Hyde performance of
the Orangemen is perplexing in
light of their outstanding person-
nel. Fullback Al Newton and
halfback Greg. Allen, running be-
hind a meaty line that averages
238 pounds, have each rushed for
more than five yards per carry.

Marty Januszkiewicz (vendors
at Syracuse games must sell dic-
tionaries instead of programs) is
a, promising Sophomore halfback.
Junior Quarterback Randy Zur

has found ends John Massis and ‘

Tony Gabriel most welcome tar-
gets for his passes.

The defense has been little
short of superb. Going into last
week’s games, Syracuse ranked
fifth in the country in total" de-
fense and third in pass defense.
The ‘Orangemen. ‘have held
their opponents to 383 yards pas-
sing and 697 rushing yards, while

the offense has amassed 1708,

total yards.

Skill and size obviously be-
long to the Orangemen, yet their
play hasn.’t reflected it. Part of
the Syracuse problem has" been

I Sarver Sends Riflers  

Against Dukes, Indian.

Sergeant Bill Sarver’s rifle
squad has a busy week-end
ahead of them, but they don’t ex-
pect many problems.

Tonight the sharpshooters host
Duquesne in a 6 p.m. Halloween
special, .

The Duke’s rifle team lost twice
to Sarver’s unit last yearand the
coach indicates that he doesn’t
think there’s been much change
in the crosstown rivals.

Tomorrow night the sharpshoot-
ers travel to Indiana, Pa., to shoot
against the Indians.

Just last week Sarver’s squad
defeated the Indians, 1,324-1,-
263.

That victory upped the riflers 
season mark to 6-0 in the West
Penn Conference and 7-1 overall. ‘ 
They’re currently in first place. ,

  Bemis Hopes Squad Up; tLAssII=IEn

 Awaiting Slippery Rock

Even -after whipping Kent

 State, 7-2, Tuesday, the boot- A

ers still may need a psycholog-

  ical uplift.

Next Tuesday the soccermen
oppose Slippery Rock at the all-
purpose practice fields and team
morale will be_ a vital factor. The
booters could barely break a smile

 after two back—to-back one goal

defeats within the past two weeks.

Still Tuesday’s victory did not
brighten the squad’s outlook.

John White, frosh lineman, who
scored three goals against Kent
State stated that the offense mow-
ed Kent down because of the posi-
tion of the opposing fullbacks.

“Their fullbacks played way
up near, midfield." It was easy to
push the ball through. It wasn’t an
important win,” White remark-

ed.

eﬂarriers Double WOI‘1{

For the first time this year

 the cross country team is fac-

 

 

  

ed with a two-week layoff be- _

tween meets. This Saturday is an
open date for the Panthers, fol-

 lowed on Nov. 8 by their meet

with Penn State.

Coach Banner is determined to

v i keep the squad in shape, schedul-
'_ ing double workouts for a good
 part of the time lapse. This en-

tails almost 20 miles of running a
day. The boys have been turning

,,__in good times during these prac-

tices and should prove a formid-
able foe for the Nittany Lions.

I . Dave Cheseborogh is expected

to be back for the meet and so the
harriers will ‘ invade‘ University
Park with a full contingent of run-
ners. Meanwhile, the main thing
is to stay loose and maintain the
pace they exhibited at Canisius.

Coach" Bemis commented that
Kent State wasn’t as good as he
had first believed. He mentioned
that the losers definitely were not
as rugged as his past opponents
have been.

Looking ahead, Bemis noted
that a lack of respect for Slippery ’
Rock could possibly cause a harsh

' tumble.
