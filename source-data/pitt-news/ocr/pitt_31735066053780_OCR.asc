"Fight entropy.”

It's closed

Bigelow shut down after months of debate

Russ Krebs

 

Beginning today, and for 29
more days, you will no longer'have to
play chicken with cars on Bigelow
Boulevard between the Cathedral of
Learning and the William Pitt Union.

The temporary closing official-
ly began today at 12:01 a.m., when bar-
riers were placed in front of the ends of
Bigelow between Forbes and Fifth
Avenues. The road will remain closed
until Oct. 15 at midnight.

“Pitt needs to be able to com-
pete to attract students,” said Pittsburgh
Mayor Tom Murphy. “We wanted to be
Pitt’s partner and felt closing Bigelow
Boulevard would make for a far more
attractive campus.”

Murphy said that if this trial
closing is successful, he would support

a permanent closing.

“If it doesn’t cause mass trafﬁc
jams and problems with the local busi-
nesses, then I would deﬁnitely support
a plan for permanent closing,” Murphy
said.

According to Jay Roling, Pitt’s
director of local relations, the purpose

. of this 30-day closing is to gather data

to determine the feasibility of a perma-
nent closing.

“We have already taken trafﬁc
counts at a myriad of intersections of
total traffic, turning movements and
pedestrian counts,” Roling said. “We
are going to take the same counts with
the road closed and compare them.”

Roling said the plight of local
businesses is also being considered
during the trial closing.

“At the same time the trafﬁc

“Get a job.”

These are not exactly the words
that are in the forefront of most under-
graduate minds in the Fall semester,

While students from around the
country are cracking the spines of their
textbooks for ﬁrst exams, Pitt students
have the opportunity to begintheir job
search and get a head start on’ the com-
petition. The University Placement
Service is running its “Opportunities
‘96: Job Fair” beginning today and
running through the 24th.

. “It’s an exciting’ time  a blast
off. It’s the chance to really launch
your career,” said Robert Perkoski,
director of the Placement Service. “We
have seen a greater interest in college
grads now than we have in ﬁve years.”

The job fair, now in its second
year, has drawn 112 employers from
around the country. Over half of this

year’s employers are new to the job
fair. _

“It’s a win-win situation for the
employer and the student,” said Lisa
Perry, a placement counselor. “The
employers bring what opportunities
they have, and the students bring the
skills that they have. The fair has
evolved into an excellent recruiting
tool.”

Employers participating in this
job fair are from all around the nation
and include such big names as IBM,
AT&T Wireless, and the U.S.
Department of State.

“Companies have already begun
competitively. recruiting from the
classes of ‘97 and ‘98,” said Perry.
“Employers are here because they have
paid to be here. They consider these to
be very serious recruiting events.”

Though last year’s event drew
over 550 students and alumni, the
Placement Service hopes to double that

rmy ROTC Alpha and Beta batallions give their final salute at

Thursday's changing of the guard ceremony on the Cathedral lawn.

ROTC ceremony transfers
command to student officers

As the troops gathered outside the
Cathedral of Learning Thursday morning,
it may have looked like a scene pulled
straight from the latest Tom Clancy novel.

Approximately 100 cadets and offi-
cers took fonnation on the lawn beside
the ﬂagpole not for battle, but to begin the
23-year-old tradition of the Reserve
Officer Training Corp [ROTC] change of
corrrrnand ceremony.

The event signiﬁes the enlisted ofﬁ-
cer’s transfer of ROI" C command to the
student ofﬁcers for the duration of the
school year.

Commander Clinton Long said this
event is the ROTC’s “oldest, most impor-
tant ceremony.”

Senior Noncommissioned Ofﬁcer,
Master Sergeant Harry Suders, was
responsible for guarding the colors during
the summer term. This year’s senior
cadets, Battalion Commander Sean
Williams and Command Sergeant Major
Andrew Clark, will assume responsibility
of the Panther Battalion during the school
year.

The ceremony consists of passing the
ROFC ﬂag from Suders to Long, who in
turn passes it to Williams then on to Clark,
who secures the ﬂag in the color bearer’s
harness. While this takes place, the
assumption of command orders areread,
oﬂicially putting Williams in charge of
the activities of the year. Then the cadets

recite the Cadet Creed, ending the cere-
mony.

This event was particularly important
for the freshman cadets. Major 
Real feels the ceremony went well for
them. - s

“The cadets really worked hard on
getting ready for it,” Real said. “They’ve
been practicing for weeks now. Especially
our freshmen who had never learned how
to salute or stand at attention.”

Cadet Platoon Leader Mike Fraas
agreed. “It’s a good way to expose the
incoming freshmen to what the
University of Pittsburgh Army ROl" C is
all about,” Fraas said. “It’s something they
can participate in to get the feeling of tra-
ditional ceremonies.”

Army ROTC is a regularly—sched-
uled credited class at the University. The

courses are aimed at providing cadets '

with an introduction and general under-
standing of the United States Army. _

ROI‘ C has a longstanding Pittsburgh
tradition. It was ﬁrst founded at Pittsburgh
in March of 1918. However, the Pitt class-
es began just after World War II, when
military instructors ﬁrst arrived at the
University.

The ROI‘ C participates in many
events on campus and in the community,
including ushering at sporting events,
Habitat for Humanity, and the Great
Race. Community service must be com-
pleted by cadets twice a semester in
accordance with ROI‘C classes.

Clinton awards $13 million
for hurricane damage

Across the Nation
RALEIGH — Clinton announced $8
million in grants for 750 workers who
lost their jobs because of Hurricane
Fran and $5 million in grants to repair
highways and bridges. Preliminary
administration estimates anticipate
$490 million in federal aid in the form
of loans, grants, and assistance from
Army engineers and other federal
agencies.

However, that ﬁgure is likely to
grow substantially because it does not
include costs such as crop insurance
payments, emergency dredging, and
housing loans.

Clinton said he would contact con-
gressional leaders Monday to push for
relief money this week, or certainly
before lawmakers leave for their elec-
tion recess next month. The

WASHINGTON — Six in 10 people

American voters are looking
inward again this year, according to
the polls, with an agenda of personal
concerns. that begin with problems

they face in their families, on their
streets, and in their communities. As
elections approach, these concerns are
expected to inﬂuence how citizens
cast their ballots. The Washington Post

Clinton campaigner and .
Mayor Murphy address
political and educational
issues with Pitt Democrats

 

With election day just around
the corner, the University hosted
two prominent political figures, Art
DeCounsey and Tom Murphy, on
Wednesday night.

Art DeCounsey, the Western
Pennsylvania political director for
President Clinton, and Pittsburgh
Mayor Tom Murphy spoke to the
group at the first meeting of the

organization. Both spoke of how the’

upcoming election will involve
many education issues that will
affect Pitt students directly.

“President Clinton’s education
platform is in favor of student loan
opportunities and Pell Grants,” said
DeCounsey, “both of which affect
many of the students here.”

DeCounsey. questioned Bob
Dole’s budget plans and his stand
on education.

“If he is going to propose tax
cuts, the money has got to come
from somewhere,” DeCounsey said.
“It looks like it’s going to come out
of education.” .

He then went on to stress how
the youth vote in the United States

‘was very important to the

Presidential election. He looked
back to the elections in 1992, when
a large number of youth voters
helped boost President Clinton’s
campaign.

“I urge you to register to vote
and become active,” DeCounsey

said. “Because remember, your
voice counts.”

Mayor Murphy, who recently
spoke at the Democratic National
Convention, stressed how we are in
a unique situation living here in
Pittsburgh.

“Cities like ours have helped to
define our society throughout histo-
ry,” Murphy said. “The results of
this election could directly affect
our city.”

He explained how there has
been an effort to clean up the city in
the past few years, and how this
election could inﬂuence that pro-
gression.

“This election involves the
grass roots people, because its out-
come will directly affect them,”
Murphy explained.

Both speakers praised the
University Democrats’ support and
urged that they increase it in the
upcoming elections.

“Plain and simple, we need
your help,” said DeCounsey. “Even
if it’s only an hour a week.”

Both also urged the students in

‘attendance to enjoy themselves.

. “Elections can be a lot of fun,”
said Murphy. “Being active and
involved in campaigns can be a
great experience.”

“I’m having the time of my
life,” said Paul McKrell, president
of the University Democrats, who
has been very active in both the
local candidates campaigns and
with the Clinton campaign.

studies are being conducted, the city is
going to conduct a_business survey
about what the effects of the trial clos-
ing mean to local businesses,” said
Roling.

During the closing, traffic will
be re—routed from Bigelow to
Bellefield and back down Fifth for dri-
vers coming from Forbes. It will be re-
routed from Bigelow to Bouquet and
back up Forbes for those driving down
Fifth, according to Gary Moses, direc-
tor of public safety at Pitt.

The routes of Pitt shuttle
busses will change as well. The most
notable change is that they will all
depart from the Fifth Avenue side of
the Student Union.

Since traffic will be heavier
than usual on Bellefield and Bouquet,
the parking meters have been bagged
and police officers will be at the cor-
ners for at least the first few days,
Moses said. Warning signs have also
been posted where the law requires,
along the involved streets.

Moses warned students not to
park on any of the effected streets. “We
will be ticketing and towing any cars
parked on the streets involved to
ensure that traffic moves smoothly,” he
said.

He said that there will be three
city-contracted towtrucks on standby
during the project.

“Even with the loss of these
few spaces, parking shouldn’t be a
problem,” said Bob Harkins, director
of parking and transportation at Pitt.

To help with the parking loss, a
20—space lot on the corner of Fifth and
Oakland Avenues opened this morning.

“We are trying to accommo-
date the parkers,” said Harkins. “I feel
we have an ample supply of parking
around. We have spaces at the Soldiers
and Sailors’ garage, and most of the
other lots in Oakland are not at capaci-
ty.” He added that at most of these lots,
students get a discount by showing
their IDs.

“The whole intent of doing this
is to unify the campus and make it bet-
ter for the student body. What we are
trying to do is make Oakland a more
livable place for students,” said
Harkins. “We accept the fact that some
people are going to be inconvenienced,
but we need to get past that inconve-
nience and help the University as a
whole.”

Harkins feels that if students
use proper crosswalks on Forbes and
Fifth, follow traffic signs, and don’t
park illegally on the effected streets,
they can help make this trial closing
run more smoothly.

“The biggest thing that stu-
dents can do is to make their support
known downtown. I think that once
traffic adjusts, it will move smoothly,”
said Harkins. ’

figure this year. The nearly two-week-
long event was kicked off on Sept.
11th with the Placement Center Open
House. Placement counselors exhibit-
ed the numerous on—site resources
which they provide to the interested
student.

The Health and Law Advising.
office provides information to students
of all years ranging from what types of
prep classes to take for the LSATs and
MCAT to how to get interviews at tar-
geted schools.

“Anything you need to know, we
have it here, or we can find out,” said
Kevin Collins, the pre-law advisor in
the placement center. “We work with
students from any year. Obviously it
helps to get them in earlier for our pur-
poses of preparing the student.”

Also on display was the place-
ment center’s new World Wide Web
site which allows students to link up to
job availabilities which are updated
daily. The site also includes an interac-
tive calendar of recruiting events as
well as career— specialized placement
center counselors to arrange meetings.

“Nothing can be better than actu-
ally coming to placement and talking
to the counselors who are very quali-
fied,” said Ben Anstandig, the place-
ment counsellor who demonstrated the
website. “But what the webpage does
is, since the placement center can’t be
open 24 hours a day, students can
access it through the Internet,” he said.

A complete listing of scheduled
times and events for the fair is avail-
able from the Placement Service
Office located in room 224 of the
William Pitt Union. Highlights of the
job fair include a program today from
noon to 1 p.m. in room 525 of the
WPU entitled “Careers for Creative
and Unconventional People.”

“This workshop is specifically
geared towards the liberal arts student
who may be having a hard time in their
job search,” said Perry. “It provides
them‘ with innovative ideas and sug-
gestions for employment.” _

Later tonight, from 5 to 7 p.m. in
the William Pitt Union dining Room
A, will be a business etiquette dinner.
The dinner, which costs $5, is the only
event of the fair for which participants
have to pay.

The fair will also include pro-
grams on temporary hiring agencies,
networking and interviewing work-
shops, and opportunities in account-
ing, governmental, and educational
employment.

Juniors, seniors, and alumni who
register to attend with the placement
service are encouraged to take part in a
networking reception on the evening
of the 23rd. The informal event will
feature refreshments and the jazz
music of Pitt alumnus Derrick Finch.

Jobs e

“It’s an opportunity to informally
meet the recruiters and others who are
in the job search and create a lasting
impression,” Perry said.

The Placement Service has indi-
cated that this is not, however, an
event where prospective employees
should bring their resumes or expect to
"be recruited.

The culminating event of
“Opportunities ‘96” is the job fair
which is on Tuesday, Sept. 24th, from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the William Pitt
Union Ballroom, Assembly Room,
Kurtzman Room, and Lower Lounge.
At this time, the attending employers
will be accepting resumes for both per-.
manent job applicants and summer
internships. Recruiters will be present
to answer any questions which partici-
pants may have and to schedule future
interviews.

What are some of the placement
center’s . suggestions for the fair?
Professional dress, good questions,
and a firm handshake are among the
top hints. Be sure "to show enthusiasm
and interest, and ask good questions.
Many of the programs featured before
the fair will help to refine the aspects
of individual appearance and settle any
jitters of uncertainty.

“Companies want Pitt students,”
Perry said. “What more can I say? Be
involved early. Come on, and get over
to the fair. We are enthusiastic; we are
excited.”

All of the featured programs in
the fair are strictly for University of
Pittsburgh students and those alumni
on the Pitt Alumni master list.

We need reform!

In the United States, 19 states have restrictions on the fund
raising a legislator can do during the legislative calendar.
Unfortunately, Pennsylvania is not one of those states.

In fact, Pennsylvania has only one restriction on fund—rais—
ing: corporations are barmed from making donations to candi-
dates. There is a loophole, however, to get around this law. A cor-
poration simply needs to hire a lobbyist, who can give as much
money as he pleases.

There are no limits on the amount of money any individual,
lobbyist, or Political Action Committee can choose to give a can-
didate. Therefore, the more money a person or group has, the
more they can inﬂuence governmental decisions, policies, and
elections. . — ,

This policy leads to an elitist governmental order in which
the rich have political clout forﬁnancing the pathways to office,
whereupon those who are less fortunate can only stand by and
watch as the system turns away ﬁom them.

In this system, as Leonard Cohen sings in “Everybody
Knows,” “The rich stay rich and the poor stay poor, that’s how
it goes.” Frankly, money is what fuels political campaigns. In
order to attain or maintain oﬂice, one needs money to get elect-
ed. In an unregulated system, the highest bidders are going to be
courted with favors and power. The lowest bidders will be cast
aside. -

That is why we need campaign ﬁnancing refonn. At the

» very least, we need a system in which ﬂrere are limitations on the

amount of money any individual, lobbyist, or PAC can spend on
a single candidate. At best, we get governrnentally-funded cam-
paigns in which the playing ﬁeld is level, so that the best candi-
date wins raﬂrer than the candidate with the most money to
spend on TV. commercials. Governrnental-funding would cause
legislators to concentrate on passing comprehensive legislation
for the greater good rather than on those select groups which
have the resources available to ﬁnance a campaign.

The most effective instrument for change is to contact your
state representative, senator, or ﬂie governor and let them know

that you want campaign ﬁnance reform. Nearly every legislative _

session, a bill for refonn comes up and is passed over. Don’t let
this year’s shot at real reform go by.

Last week, I told you about the
Dutch tradition of buying bikes from
junks. Another curious fact about the

- Netherlands is the role that a certain

plant plays. No, I’m not about to

‘ launch into a discussion on pot; that’s

another topic. This particular plant
has a greater inﬂuence on daily life
than marijuana does. Used to stain
hot water and give it an undeﬁnable
ﬂavor, this plant is commonly known
as tea. Mention tea in the U.S., and
people are likely to get either mental
pictures of old English ladies sipping
from delicate, tiny tea cups, or ﬂash-
backs to junior high history lessons
about the Boston Tea Party. Tea just
isn’t a daily drink for the vast majori-
ty of the American population. In
fact, I could tell I was deﬁnitely back
in America when a waitress asked me
if I wanted “iced tea” when I asked
for “tea.” ‘

I suppose you want me to stop
babbling about how Americans don’t
drink tea and explain why it’s so
important in Holland. Well, tea serves

' as an excuse for socializing at various

points during the day. In the Dutch ‘

home, this is certainly evident.
Breakfast includes tea, starting the
day off with a nice caffeine boost. To
befair,Ihavetosaythatteaandcof-
fee go together", they are partners in
the easily won struggle to keep
humankind hooked on caffeine, the
legal upper. However, it must be
pointed out that tea is a signiﬁcant
partner —— it’s not just an after-
thought

Back to my story: after breakfast
has long been cleared away, the tea
pot comes out again at around 11 or

 

Dutch drug of choice?

11:30. Coffee is available for those

who prefer it, but tea is really king at
this time, accompanied by the

famous cookie tin. The cookie tin is

passed around, and everyone gets

one cookie. If there are guests, there
might even be a piece of cake for
everyone. After everything has been
cleared away, people continue with
whatever they were doing before. A
bit over an hour later, lunch comes
around. Lunch is tea-free, except for
true addicts who can have yet anoth-
er cup of the hot liquid But at around
3:30 or 4 p.m., tea comesback in full
force again with its faithful compan-
ion, the coolde tin. More social chit-
chat accompanies the tea; it’s an
excellent excuse for everyone to stop
what they’re doing and discuss daily
business. By the way, nobody drinks
tea from mugs, that’s an
Americanism. It’s either served in tea
cups or in_ the glass heat-resistant
cups that everyone seems to have.

At 5 or 5:30 p.m., there’s a break
ﬁom the tea and coffee and another
excuse for socializing takes center
stage. This is called the barrel , which
is when people have a glass of wine,
sheny, kier, or Dutch whiskey. This
time, savory snacks are brought out,
usually nuts or various mixes of ﬂa-
vored crackers. Directly after the bar-
ml, at 6, it’s time for dinner. After din-
ner, tlrere’s a fairly long refrain from
any kind of eating or drinking, but at
around 8:30 p.m., tea and coffee are
reintroduced with a chocolate or
some other small sweet.

But as crazy as this constant
division of the day into tea times
seems, nothing amazed me as much
as the scene at the university.
Whereas the American student heads
for the soda machine for a caﬁeine

boost, the Dutch student heads (often
with his or her own small mug) to the
tea and coffee machine. Dutch urti-
versity classes last 2-4 hours but
pause every hour for a tea and coffee
break, accommodating the need for
caffeine. During these breaks,’huge
lines form behind the caﬂ’eine vend-

ing  and everyone in line, .

professor included, smokes his or her
' Marlboros or rolls a heavy shag and
The real conﬁrmation of my sus-
picion of a caffeine addiction prob-
lem came during exams. You might
suspect that I’m going to say that the
levels of tea and coffee consumption
go up tremendously during this
stressful period Well; that’s true, but
not "really unusual considering it’s a
universal trait of stressed, informa-
tion—cramrning students. Actually, I
mean literally during exams. There I
was, sweating nervously, chewing on
my pencil trying to remember in
what year Dante died, and my con-
centration was broken by a tea lady. I
kid you not. There was actually a
lady walking up and down the isles
DURING the exam selling coffee
and tea and various cookies. No joke.
I nearly started laughing hysterically.
I mean, really, you’re sitting. there
getting a hand cramp from writing
your exam that counts for 100 per-
cent of your grade for the course, and
this kooky lady asks if you would
care for a cup of tea. Really, yes, I’d
love a cup, I think I need the break,
cause I’m sure I have enough time to
sit here and sip tea whilst writing my
exam

until the beginning of September,
this means that he has to arrive in
town around Aug. 27, find someplace
to crash with all of his stuﬁ‘ for the
first several days of class, and then
try to move it all into his new apart-
ment during his “free time,” which is
a shorter way of saying “the time
during which he really needs to be
doing all of the other work that has
just materialized.” :

COYMIR #3 is something I
learned from experience. Over the
summer, I had a small, two—bedroom
Shadyside apartment, in which
Roommate A and I lived while wait-
ing for our other four roommates to
arrive in the fall to move into our
much larger apartment in Oakland.
Well, Roommates B, C, D, and E all
got into town between‘Aug. 26 and
27, and had to, sleep on the ﬂoor in
our tiny summer apartment until our
new lease started on Sept. 1. To help
you understand the dire nature of this
situation, let me paint a picture:

It’s 7 a.m. on the first day of
class. I’m awakened by a loud
thump, followed by some even loud-
er cursing, outside my bedroom door.
I get up and look, to find that it was
caused by Roommate A tripping over

  

the leg of Roommate B, whose now— '

bruised body is sprawled across the

floor of the hallway, where he went ,

to sleep because the only part of the
living room floor not covered by
forty-seven trillion cardboard boxes
full of junk is occupied by the snor-
ing form of Roommate C, who insist-
ed on having that spot for himself
because it was underneath the win-
dow. Roommate D has just run out
the front door in a mad dash that
embodies the sentiment, “I’m late for
my first class!” ——_ a dash necessitat-_
ed by Roommate E, who has been
standing in the shower "for forty-five
minutes, continually assuring us that
he’s almost done. -

Just then, the doorbell rings. I
open the door to find the landlord’s
mother, pushing a mechanical mon-
strosity that would have been too
large to fit in the place before the
herd arrived; when I just gape at her
in bewildered disbelief, she_cheerily
announces, “Time to steam-clean the
carpets! Would everybody please
move into the back half of the apart-
ment until tomorrow?”

I think you all see what I’m get- I

ting at here. Let’s push the first day
of class back to the Tuesday after
Labor Day, shall we? Beginning a
new school year is stressful enough
without inventing artificial ways to
make it worse.

Bob Dole’s war record —— and
Bill Clinton’s lack of one — has
become a major theme in Dole’s
campaign for the presidency. Dole,
at the behest of his handlers, doesn’t
talk much about his wartime
exploits, beyond his references to
the grievous wounds he suffered and
his painful course of rehabilitation.
Dole’s understated reticence, howev-
er, has given way to the widespread
belief that his service was particular-
ly exemplary. This overstated truth,
which has been kept alive by jour-

nalists and the GOP propaganda

gang, has dealt a blow to Dole’s reli-
ability.

In most journalistic accounts,
Dole’s wartime exploits are accept-
ed, without question, as being gen-
uinely authentic. In a recent G.O.P.
fund—raising letter signed by Dole,
the following statement appears:
“And when I was asked to lead my
men up a rocky hill in Italy into the
roaring guns and mortar fire. of the
German Wehrmacht, my sense of
duty never wavered.” The official
campaign Web site describes his
experiences in similarly heroic
terms. And although these sources
are not in full agreement with one
another, the following picture of Bob

THE put NEWS

Dole’s war record begins to develop.
In 1942, Dole left college in
earnest to enlist in the service. He
joined the Reserves, but soon after
asked to be placed on active duty.

Dole returned to lead his platoon
on a second patrol only two days
later after being slightly wounded on
a night patrol. 1

While dragging a wounded
radioman into a shell hole, Dole was
gravely wounded by enemy shrap-
nel.

Dole was awarded two Bronze
Stars for his “heroism under fire.”

Yet, all of the above are either
exaggerated or inaccurate. Let’s
carefully examine Dole’s military
record, not for the purpose of finding
fault with Dole’s honorable service
to his country, but rather to cast
doubt on the reliability of his cam-
paign rhetoric.

Dole left college in earnest to
enlist. In 1942, Dole joined the
Army’s Enlisted Reserve Corps, not
the regular Army. By’ joining the
Reserves, Dole could remain a stu-
dent and defer induction into the
military. Dole acknowledges, but
doesn’t explain how he ended up in
the Reserves. In 1943, as the war
progressed, Dole participated in the
Army Specialized Training Program
and studied engineering at Brooklyn
College until the spring of 1944. In

November 1944, after training in
Louisiana, Georgia, and Kentucky,
now as an antitank gunner, Dole was
shipped off to Italy. Once in the field
of combat, Dole tried for a posting in
the Army sports unit, according to
Richard Cramer’s “Bob Dole.”
Instead, he was assigned to the most
undesirable unit in the Army:
Combat Infantry.

Only two days after being
wounded by a grenade, Dole
returned to lead his men on another
patrol. In his autobiography, Dole
confesses that the wound for which
he won a Purple Heart was self-
inﬂicted. He admits that “it wasn’t a
very good pitch” and that “in the
darkness, the grenade must have
struck a tree and bounced of ,”
exploding nearby and sending a sliv-
er of metal into his leg. The wound
was so minor that he led another
patrol two nights later. Dole does not
mention that others were also injured

‘ by his misguided toss.

Dole was wounded saving his
radioman. Dole writes that he
jumped into a shell hole for protec-
tion in the course of an attack in
which several members of his pla-
toon were hit. “From where I was
crouched,” he explains, “I could see
my platoon’s radioman go down
After ‘pulling his lifeless form into
the foxhole, I scrambled back out

Bola Dole tells tall tals of wartime accomplishments

again. As I did, I felt a sharp sting in
my upper right back.” Thus, his
wound came after he had pulled the
radioman into the shell hole.

Dole was awarded two Bronze
Stars for his valiancy. Dole’s cam-
paign literature makes note of his
two Bronze Stars, but does not pro-
duce any citations. The Army’s
Personnel Records Center says he
received only one, and his separation
notice confirms this.
received two Bronze Stars, the sec-
ond one was awarded to him under a
policy instituted in 1947 which
awarded the medal to every holder of
the Combat Infantryman’s Badge. In
other words, Dole’s second award
would have been simply for being in
combat — not as Bronze Stars are
awarded in wartime, for acting with
“heroic” or “meritorious” conduct. '

The unvarnished picture of
Dole’s wartime record is consider-
ably less than awe-inspiring, and yet
the falsehoods about his experiences
continue to be accepted as genuinely
authentic. In the interests of political
capital, the GOP following wil1-con-
tinue to portray Dole as a valiant
leader, winner of two Bronze Stars
and two Purple Hearts.

Daniel Weiss has great respect for
all of America’s war veterans,
including Bob Dole.

Pitt fans are
the worst I  

 

Pitt fans just can’t get anything right.
Sat11rday’s game against Houston is the lat-
est lowlight that serves as evidence for that
sadfact

Many Panther backers are just plain
foolish. , Sometimes, that’s good. It was
great when the crowd booed the referees for
penalizing Curtis Anderson after he pound-
ed Charles West on a fair catch of a punt in
the second quarter. It’s about time Pitt start-
ed playing that kind of emotional football.
Fans ought to encourage it, despite the fact
that Anderson’s hit may have been the most
blatant penalty in Pitt history.

Unfortunately, there weren’t many
people around to encourage anything at
Saturday’s game. There was no excuse for
the poor attendance, particularly in the stu-
dent section. One quick glance at this sea-
son’s schedule, and it should have been
obvious that this game would be the best of
the season. On paper, it looked like a high-
scoring, evenly-rnatched game. We got
more than anyone could have expected.
You probably missed it, and I have no sym-

pathy for you, since you were foolish '

enough to skip the best game here in two
years. ’

I’m well aware that the student section
of Pitt Stadium is not the most enticing real

Houston beats Panthers in overtime

Kevin Lilley

 

In their first meeting, the Pitt

‘Panthers and the NCAA college

football overtime system didn’t hit
it off.

After allowing a Houston
Cougar score on the opening series
of the new extra frame, the Panthers
failed to answer with one of their

‘ . own. So, in their first meeting with

Pitt, it would be the Cougars who
earned the 42-35’ victory.

“This type of overtime  is not
a complete game,” said Pitt Head
Coach Johnny Majors. “A true over-
time should only be played  where
football is played like football.
[But] that’s no excuse tonight. We
lost.”

Pitt won the overtime toss and
elected to defend in the first 25-yard
overtime series_in school .and Big
East Conference history. Houston’s
Chuck Clements opened the mini-
drive for the Cougars, completing
his 21st pass of the game to Charles
West for nine yards. A first down, an
incompletion, and a short rush later
set up a third—and_-six from the nine,
and Pitt’s first chance to stop the
drive.

It would be their last, as
Clements fired a touchdown pass to
Rob_bie Wheeler to end phase one of
the period. Houston converted the
extra point before the Panthers got
their chance at an overtime score.

Billy West got three chances at
the all—important first down marker
in the fifth quarter but came up two
yards shy to set up a crucial fourth
down. Matt Lytle then took the run-
ning game into his own hands, send-
ing West out of the backfield and

stutter-"stepping his way towards the
marker on a quarterback draw.

Standing in his way was 5—foot-
9, 197-pound sophomore .safety
Stedmon Forman, who gave up 30
pounds to his target.

Lytlelowered his shoulder and
stretched out the football, but
Forman’s tackle kept him six inches
away from the marker.

“We ran the QB draw all week,”
said Lytle after the loss. “I just
looked for a hole. I thought I had the
first down, but they marked it where
my knees were, and it came up
short.”

Forman’s tackle was one of the
few that Houston could muster ver-
sus the 225-yard Panther rushing
attack. West was the team’s rushing
leader with 144 yards, including 33
on the team’s first scoring drive. His
last rush of the drive, a three-yard
burst up the middle to the Cougar

Mindless overtime
format ruins great game

JMike Kovok

y
991.’ /

In a game that featured two run-
ning backs (Houston’s Antowain
Smith and Pitt’s Billy West) rushing
for a, combined 336 yards, with the
offenses scoring 77 points with 815
yards total offense and a twenty-eight
point run by the Cougars, a decision
reached by the NCAA decided the out-
come.

To appease college football fans,
the NCAA implemented overtime dur-
ing the off—season against the graces of
many top coaches and schools.

“I’ve always been strongly anti-
overtime,” Pitt‘ Coach Johnny Majors
said. “In every vote I’ve ever had,
every meeting I’ve attended, I’ve been
against it.” A

Majors might have felt differently
had Pitt (1-2) won the game. Even so,
the general consensus leans towards
the disapproval of the NCAA’s over-
time structure. '

“Overtime can go either way,” said
Matt Lytle, Pitt’s starting quarterback.
“I don’t like it at all. We should have
won the game before overtime.” _

When two teams are tied at the end

 

of regulation, the respective team cap-
tains walk on the field_for another coin
toss. Most of the time, teams defer the
toss, electing to play defense first.

This was the case "with Pitt. They
won the coin toss and . deferred to
Houston.

“We wanted to see what Houston
could do,” Lytle said. “That way we
knew what we had to do to match
them.” .-

When Houston received the ball at
the Pitt 25-yard-line, the pressure was
placed upon the Pitt defense, who sur-
rendered 472 total yards and 279 rush-
ing yards to stop the Cougar attack.

Cougar quarterback Chuck
Clements completed the first pass of
extra time to Charles West for nine
yards. Then Smith, who rushed for 192
yards, dove ahead to the.12 and picked
up the first down. ‘

On the next play, Rashaad
Whitmill broke up a pass that looked
like an apparent touchdown. After a

run, Houston faced a third-and-six at

the Pitt 10. Robbie Wheeler got by
safety John Jenkins in the right corner
of the end zone for what proved to be
the game—winning touchdown.

Matt l.e’s “uarterback draw in overtime on frthown as
stopped short by the Cougar defense.

League, the NCAA overtime is not
sudden death, when the first score after
regulation time wins. Pitt still had a
chance to tie the game because each
team is guaranteed one possession.

Pitt’s last shot to tie the game start-
ed at the Houston 25-yard-line. After
Billy West, who rushed for 144 yards,
popped a seven—yard carry, Pitt faced a
third—and-two at the 17. West tried to
sneak around the left end, but the
Cougar defense stuffed him.

So, the game came down to one

final play. Pitt faced a fourth—and-
three. Majors called a quarterback
draw. West went in motion, and Lytle
was left alone in the backfield. He
fought his way through the right side
of the line but came up short.

A visibly distraught Majors
summed up his thoughts on the struc-
ture of NCAA overtime said, “I’ve said
this before, and I’ll say it again: a true
overtime should be played where foot-
ball is played like football, a chance to
play a full quarter.”

Cougar one after Schulters’ score,
and Smith’s off-tackle run on first
down gained only three yards.

He fared ‘better on his next

‘attempt, taking the handoff around

left end and sprinting untouched for
96 yards into the Panther end zone.
Smith had recorded -23 yards in the
first quarter but finished with a 192-
yard performance on the heels of his
breakaway touchdown.

“I used what little speed I had to
get into the end zone,” said Smith. “I
don’t know who covered me, but I’m
thankful to our whole team.”

Nearly the whole Cougar team
did cover Smith on the play, falling
into a punt—return type blocking for-
mation and creating a Panther—free
corridor along the sideline.

The corridor stayed open for the
second and third quarters, as the
Cougars scored three more touch-
downs without a Pitt response.
Clements woke the Houston passing
attack from its slumber, throwing for
all three scores and amassing most
of his 193 yards passing during the
Cougar rally.

“We thought Clements was a
very good passer,” said Majors.
“They had a well-designed passing
game. Their offense  it was just a
mismatch.”

But before the third quarter
ended, the Pitt offense answered.
Lytle led the squad on a 73-yard
scoring drive, highlighted by the
quarterback’s 20-yard scramble and

finished off by another six-yard

‘ Schulters’ score.

Then it was the defense’s turn in
the Pitt Stadium spotlightgstopping
the Cougar attack on its last six reg-
ulation drives. Linebacker Phil
Clarke stopped a Houston drive sin-
gle—handedly, knocking the ball out

of Smith’s hands and pouncing on it .

in the backfield. John Jenkins would
also record a takeaway, intercepting
Clements on the Pitt four yard—line
to kill another drive.

Late in the fourth, the Panthers
put together their final scoring drive
on the strength of Schulters (four
carries on the drive for 37 yards) and
Chris Schneider, whose nine—yard
bull-rush into the end zone tied the
score at 35 apiece. g

Houston would fail to reply, and
Pitt would hold for overtime on the
final possession. Then the Cougar
offense would rise again, handing
Pitt its first non-conference loss of
the year and its first overtime defeat

“Naturally, it’s very disappoint-
ing to lose,” said Majors. “There is
no good way to lose — overtime,
