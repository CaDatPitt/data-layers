Pitt Near Top
In Chase For

National Title '

 

Victories Place Pitt On Par With
Undefeated Squads: Duke,

NationalHonorsInSight

 

By Robert E. Badger
Pitt News Sports Editor

Saturday four more members of the
previously undefeated, untied, class of
football elevens fell by the wayside.

Right here at the Pitt Stadium the
Nebraska Cornhuskers lost to ‘the
Panthers. Out at Ann Arbor, Michi-
gan met a tartar in the Minnesota
Gophers and was lucky to get out of
the game with a scoreless tie_ Way
down South the Georgia Bulldogs were
handed a setback by a mediocre
Auburn team. And out on the Paciﬁc
coast Oregon, conqueror of Oregon
State, was soundly trounced by South-
ern California’s Trojans.

Now, what is the football picture
today? Duke university has the only
undefeated, untied football team in
the South. However the team has
played no team with a national reD11'
tation and consequently cannot be
justified in claiming any national
championship. Princeton and Army
are the only undefeated, untied magor
teams in the East. Princeton’s record
is much like that of Duke. The
Tigers have not played a representa-
tive schedule, and any claims _they
may make to the mythical national
title will receive scant recognition.

Army, on the other hand, has a
little greater right to lay claim to
championship honors, The Cadets
own victories over two major op-
ponents, Harvard and Illinois. Harv-
ard, as usual, is just a name. Illi-
nois, this year, has a better team than
it has had in recent years. Army has
yet to meet Notre Dame, among
others. A victory over the Irish will
make the ‘Vest Point record much
better. However, we are picking
Notre Dame in this game,

That ends the meagre list of unde-
feated, untied football teams.

Now, where does Pitt ﬁt into the
‘football picture? The Panthers have
played a much more impressive sched-
ule than any of the above mentioned
teams still in the unbeaten, untied
category, Their record includes vic-
tories over previously unbeaten, un-
tied Navy, Diiquesne, and Nebraska
teams, a victory over Notre Dame
when the Ramblers gained very few
of those 1600 yards they have gained
thus far this year, and victories over
W & J, Centre, and VVest Virginia.
They went out to Minnesota where
everything seemed to go wrong for
them and consequently lost to the
Gophers, 7 to 3. This game was one
of those things where the losing team
leads in everything but the score.

Should the Panthers be successful
in winning over Carnegie Tech in
their only remaining game they will
have a record second to none. It will
compare favorably with Stanford’s,
Southern California’s, Army’s, or any
other leader’s. Minnesota lost what-
ever chance it had for national hon-
ors by tying four games with four of
its Big Ten rivals,

There's the picture. By defeating
the Carnegie Tech Tartans the Panth-
ers will have a claim for national
honors as justiﬁed as those of any
other team in the country.

weeks, replacing the ribbon worn by
the pledges over the week-end. These
ribbons were either received by the
rushees along with their formal invi-
tation to join the sorority or were
pinned on at informal ribbon teas on
Sunday afternoon.

The pledging was the culmination
of annual fall rushing which took
place on Sunday, November 12.

The Freshman Dance Friday night
at the Grotto Ballroom maintained the
tradition of they a_r,i_nual first year af-
fair by clearing a proﬁt. An incom-
plete report obtained by the Pitt
News shows that the dance netted
approximately $31.86.

The proﬁt of the affair is about $52
below that realized by the class of
1936 with its Freshman Dance, al-
though only five additional couples
attended the dance last year. One hun-
dred and eighty-four were present at
the Grotto Friday night.

Expenses this year were $52 above
the amount outlaid last year, expense
attributed to increased cost of ball-
room, programs, printing, and deco-
rations.

well. balanced combination of soft and
low Waltzes, hot, snappy numbers,
and one or two novelty arrange-
ments. Eloise Rutter, the featured
vocalist of the band, scored with the
dancers with a creditable voice and
the stage presence of a veteran
trouper.

As usual with freshman dances, the
majority of those in attendance were
upperclassinen, which may be traced,
this year, to the early date of the af-
fair. Last year’s Freshman Dance
took place in March.

The Grand March was led by Har-
riet (Lewis, C37, and Edwin Beach-
ler, C37, chairman of the affair.

Swartz, As King, Rates Acting Honors

In “The Queen’s Husband,” Says Herrick

Setting, Make-Ups First-
Rate, Lighting Good,
He Adds

.._._.-_—.......

By Marvin T. Herrick
Associate Professor of English

The Pitt Players opened the campus
season last Thursday night with “The
Queen’s Husband,” by Robert Sher-
wood. The audience, more than half
of which was male, ﬁlled all but the
last four or ﬁve rows of the Sclienley
ballroom. The air in the ballroom
was good, the acoustics good, and the
carpeted foyer was a pleasant place to
gossip between acts. The high chan-
deliers, the mirrors, and the University-
symphony orchestra were pleasant ad-
juncts to the royal atmosphere of the
play.

The play itself is not a dramatic
masterpiece, but good enough, per-
haps, for an open-er. Though written
several years ago, the story is timely.
We witnessed a struggle between the
vested interests and the liberal left
wing. After a. noisy revolution,
which knocked chunks of plaster from
the royal ceiling and alarmed the ho-
tel guests in the lobby, the left wing
triumphed. King Eric VIII, who rose,
during the revolution, from the posi-

tion of “queen’s husband” and runner-
up in the palace checker champion-
ship to that of a wise, liberal ruler,
winds up the action by promising the
country a new deal. The dialogue is
clever, often witty. At least one real
character, the King, emerges. There
are good character sketches General
Northrup, the hard-boiled, bureau-
cratic, political boss, in Queen Martha,
almost a burlesque of the Roumanian
Marie, and in Phipps the royal ﬁunkey,
the checker champion. The other
characters, even in the most expert
hands, would hardly show much real
life and vigor.

What did the Pitt Players do with
the play?

The setting was ﬁrst—rate, It was
ornamental without being junky, pala-
tial without a hint of Cecil B. DeM.ille.
The lighting, after one false start in
the ﬁrst act, was mainly good enough.
There was no clear distinction, how-
ever, between the night and afternoon
scenes. I suspect that the electri-
cians were hampered by cramped
space and equipment, but they might
have done more with the back drop
in the daylight scenes. The costumes
were highly ornamental, and, as far
as I know, a la mode of Eric’s court.
I did wonder why the Queen wore a
black evening gown to the afternoon
,wedding, but admit that the fashion

for queens is beyond me. The make-
ups were exceptionally good, the most
professional touch in the whole show.

And the acting? There was also
some acting.

possession in the undergraduate actor,
He can read lines intelligently, almost
as rare an accomplishment. He has
poise and humor. His worst faults
were inability to remain still unless
seated and a ﬁdgety roving of the
eyes which weakened the emphasis of
many of his best speeches. These
faults, however, can easily be cor-
rected. His uncertain movements
were typical of most of the cast,
Which apparently has yet to learn
that standing stock-still is always bet-
ter than aimless movement. His rov-
iﬂg eye was typical of the general
lack among all the players of a con-
sistent eye-level.

Second honors went to Joseph Let-
teriello, who made the minor role of

Freshman Class
Pledges $750 To
Chest Drive Fund

Seminar, Fraternity Returns Not
Checked As Yet, Says
Wadsworth, Director

Returns Due Dec. 15th

A check up of the freshman English
classes’ contributions to the Student
Chest drive indicates a total of about
$750 for the group, This is the only
group return in the drive for which
any ﬁgures are available.

Fraternities that have handed in
their contributions have for the most
part reported 100 per cent contribu-
tion of membership; until a check up
on these returns has been made, how-
ever, no ﬁgures will be published.

Other returns from the engineering
seminars, business administration
seminars and class representatives
are coming in slowly, and have not
been checked, as yet, by Homer
Wadsworth, C35, director of the drive.

Instructions will be given this week
to student workers to aid them in
ﬁnishing the drive. With these in-
structions will be enclosed a list of
students whom the worker has con-
tacted, indicating those who have paid
and those who have pledged. The re-
ceipts for those students who have
paid in full will also be returned.

The instructions for the workers
are as follows: Return the receipts
to those who paid in cash. Receipts
will be given to those students who
have pledged, only when the pledge
is paid in full.

Collect the money from those who
have pledged. All pledges are due
December 15, unless a later date was
designated. Be sure to turn in the
name and amounts for all who pay
money to you,

Interview individually, at the earli-
est possible moment, all who have not
pledged.

1,200 Parents Expected

One hundred and ﬁfty students have
been chosen from representative
branches of the University to serve
as aides and ushers at Chancellor
John G. Bowmaii’s twelfth annual re-
ception to the parents of freshmen
next Friday evening in Memorial hall.
Thirty-ﬁve are members of Pitt Riﬂes,
honorary military drill platoon; over
ﬁfty are men students chosen by Theo-
dore Biddle, assistant dean of men,
from representative branches of the
University; and the rest are women
students chosen by Thyrsa W. Amos,
dean of women. T

These student aides will attend a
meeting in the banquet room of
Memorial hall Thursday afternoon at
4 o’clock, at which time their duties
will be explained to them. They will
escort the parents as they come into
the main auditorium of Memorial hall,
and help them locate the various de-
partments and the instructors of their
sons and daughters.

Invitations have been sent to the
parents of every freshman in the Uni-
versity, and, according to an an-
nouncement from the ofﬁce of Walter
Rome, dean of men, about 1200 par-
ents are expected to attend the re-
ception Friday night.

The annual reception was origi-
nated at Pitt; since the ﬁrst, 12
years ago, several other colleges and
universities have followed Pitt’s lead
and established like receptions. The
administration at the University has
found that these annual conferences
between the parents and instructors
have been very successful.

The highlight of the program will
be an address by Dr, John G. Bowman,
Chancellor of the University, in the
main auditorium after which the con-
ferences will take place on the second
and third ﬂoors of the building.

Freshman Women
Elect Executives
By New Methods

Vote For Second, Third Choices
To Eliminate Possibility
Of Grade Ineligibility

Announce Results Soon

Three new methods of voting were
introduced by freshman women at
their election last Friday in Heinz
House. Preferential balloting, talks
by the nominees, and a delayed an-
nouncement of the results were the
innovations,

Because of the delay and incon-
venience occurring in past years
when the women elected were de-
clared ineligible due to low grades,
this new system of preferential voting
was used. This year nominees were
voted on as first, second, or third
choice. If it is found, next Monday
when the grades are made known,
that the winning candidate is ineligi-
ble, the second choice will receive the
office. Miss Helen Rush, assistant
dean of women, will announce the re-
sults sometime soon.

The talks given by the nominees
prior to the balloting enabled the
class to know more about the women
they were voting for. Three of the
four candidates for president urged
that freshman women take the lead
in campus activities and deplored the
fact that only three out of the 14
members of Student Council were
women while the ratio of women stu-
dents at the University is two for
every three men.

The nominees for offices were:
president, Jean Hamilton, Dorothy
Holbrook, Alice Lewis, Marcella Ley-
ton; vice president, Jane Critchlow,
Katherine Hardy, Dorothy Schwartz,
Helen Snyder; secretary, Jean Bash,
Rita Carey, Arlene Cupples, Janet
Gass; treasurer, Lois Follansbee, Jean
McMasters, Ruth Mills, Betty Rieger;
WSGA representative, Ruth Alpern,
Alberta Boyer, Eleanor Fedigan, Bar-
bara Hargrave, Eleanor Scott. These
women were selected two weeks ago
by 35 representatives from the mentor
groups,

Frieda Goldsteiii, C35, chairman of
the organization committee of WSGA,
presided at the meeting.

Herrick Reviews.
‘Queen’s Husband’

(Continued From Page One.)
Prince William the brightest spot in
the last act, I do not agree with his
interpretation of the character, but
granting he had a right to make the
Prince an effeminate, lisping coxcomb,
he surely succeeded. He picked a
definite pattern of characterization
and stuck to it. He was the one actor
who seemed to know exactly what
every next move was to be, and he
moved deliberately, unhesitatingly.
He was the one actor who seemed to
realize the value of pause. There is
a good old saying, “The sooner an
amateur show is over the better.” But
the cast of “The Queen’s Husband”
followed that maxim too literally, all
but Letteriel1o_ He, on the contrary,
relished every move and every word.
And the audience shared his relish.
The audience, with the exception of
that too-brief interval while Prince
William was on the scene, was bela-
bored with a torrent of dialogue from
curtain to curtain, without one real
pause.

Betty Quarrie, who has possibly the
best stage presence of any of the play-
«ers, was not very happy in her role of
the Queen. Starting out with a bang,
she spent all her ammunition in the
ﬁrst ﬁve minutes. Afterwards she
was an anti-climax. There was noth-

‘much at the audience and not enough
with the other characters, She had a
bad habit of slumping out of charac-
ter between speeches.

Louis Reizenstein’s Phipps was
pretty Wooden, but amusing. George
Strong, as Major Blent, was convinc-
ingly upright and soldierly. His read-
ing was better than average. The
ﬁne make-up of John Hesselbein, who
played the radical professor, Dr, Fell-
man, won him half the battle, and he
added something to the other half.
Nathan Elbaum’s Lord Birten showed
glimpses of the oily diplomat, but too
often the ﬁgure creaked. Herbert
Fine, as General Northrup, strutted
and ranted in ﬁne choler. He had
the most gusto, but there was little
beyond gusto, no let-up in the contin-
uous pow-wow he was forever raising.
Elizabeth Black, who worked hard at
the part of Princess Anne, has a lot
to learn about the fundamentals of
reading and walking across the stage.
With more experience, she may be
able to present something besides an
attractive appearance, Joseph Sam-
son, as Granton, the royal secretary,
was impeccable in appearance, but
too inﬂexible a suitor, even for a prin-
cess.

My chief general criticism is that

 

Dental Aches, Throbs T
Vanish As Doctors
Use Soft Soap

If, on your next trip the den-
tist smiles at you, offers you the
latest magazines, and then fully
agrees with you about your
aches and pains, keep your shirt
on, He’s merely using applied
psychology and will bring it out
later in the bill.

Dr. C. A. Whitmer, instructor
in psychology, started this idea
when he addressed the several,
hundred Western Pennsylvania
dentists on “The Use of Psychol-
ogy in Talking to Patients,” at
the closing session of the Odonto-
logical Society convention at the
William Penn hotel last Thurs-
day.

Advising dentists that diplo-
macy with patients pays, Dr.
Whitmer also instructed them to
beware of imaginary pains.

“A great many people go to
dentists believing they are in
acute pain,” said Dr, Whitmer.
“They really are not—but that's
no reason to tell them so. Just
treat them as though they were
in pain for a while and then,
when you say, ‘Now, that doesn’t
hurt a bit, does it?’ They’ll think
they feel ﬁne.”

Symposium Group
Invites Debaters

Pitt Forensic Association Will
Discuss NRA At Meet

The Men’s Debating association has
accepted an invitation to take part
in a symposium at Penn State col-
lege December 8 and 9. Penn State,
Pennsylvania, Temple and the Uni-
versity will be the schools represent-
ed.

According to the present plans
each school will be represented by
two speakers who will discuss the
various features of the NRA. Pitt’s
two speakers have not yet been
chosen.

The association will also present
seven debates before the Allegheny
County League of Women Voters in
January.

Saul Shapira, C34, manager of the
debating team, has announced that all
local intercollegiate debates will be
presented before fraternities, and that
any fraternity interested in hearing
a debate should speak to him about
it.

4-:

the cast has not yet paid enough at-
tention to the fundamentals of read-
ing lines and of moving with a pur-

pose. The speech, with a few excep-
tions, was Dbor. The sloppy enuncia-
tion as such words as William

(“Weeum”) and million (“mihun”)
was appalling to the ﬁnicky listener.
Reading of lines, with a few excep-
tions, was poor. Most of the players
lost all emphasis by too much empha-
sis; they pounded almost every word
in every speech, There was little
variety, little shading, no pauses, and
almost no demonstration that the
speakers thoroughly understood what
they were saying. At times the
grouping was bad, There was a
tendency to ﬂatten out the groups into
a straight line across the stage. There
were several awkward crosses in
front of speakers. Many of the exits
were fade-aways. Most of the players
have learned not to be afraid of the
furniture, but they have Iiot yet
learned not to be afraid of each
other. The embraces were of the
familiar amateurish type——about a
yard between the pairs of feet and the
stiff apex of the triangle at the heads.

But it is always easy to pick faults
in an amateur performance, and I re-
alize that this was the first attempt of
the season, Good speech is hard to
acquire when the actor has bad
speech. lvlost of the responsibility
should rest upon the individual actor,
especially when the director has to
run the whole performance himself,
everything from posters to make-up.
The student can improve his own
speech if he wants to. Reading of
lines is ﬁrst of all understanding of
lines, then individual practice, repeti-
tion until the right meaning appears.
Obviously the players need to give
more attention to intelligent reading
of lines. The reading of “The Queen’s
Husband” did not measure up to the
standard of the spectacle, the scenery,
costumes, and make-up_ Nor did the
action, the moving and grouping of
the actors. Intelligent reading of
lines, with a minimum of designed ac-
tion, are the necessary fundamentals
of any stage performance. I, for one,
would be willing to put up with
shabby scenery and crude lighting if
the action and speech were not shab-
by. The Pitt Players need more work
in the simple fundamentals of acting.
I trust we shall see an improvement
at the next performance, when the
Players should have reached mid—sea-
son form.

$1,000 Donated
For Room Fund

300 Attend Scottish Reception In’

Honor Of Dr. Bowman

At the largest gathering ever to
take place in the Cathedral, R. B.
Mellon, president of Mellon National
bank, presented a $1,000 check, for
use in the construction of the Cathe-
dral Scottish room, to Dr, John G.
Bowman, Chancellor of the Univer-
sity. The reception was given in Dr.
Bowman’s honor in the offices of Mrs.
Ruth Crawford Mitchell, adviser to
the nationality rooms, Thursday night.
The check raised the fund for the
room to $4,000.

Regaled in real Scotch kilts, a
Scottish clan member introduced Dr.
Bowman, Dr. John B. Sutherland,
chairman of the Scottish committee,
and James Brown, vice chairman of
the committee. After the audience
sang “Scot Wha ’hae," a lengthy
Scottish program began. It consisted
of remarks by Mr. Brown; the read-
ing of a testimonal poem written to
Dr. Bowman by Mrs, E. S. Dick, a
member of the Pittsburgh Daughters
of Scotia; incidental songs by Mr. J.
Bain, Mr. Robert Bruce, Miss Cathie

McRae, and Mr, James Brown; a read-

ing by Mr. Bill McLay; a dance by
Mr. George Keiller; remarks by Dr.
Sutherland, introducing Dr. Bowman;
Dr. Bowman’s reply; and group sing-
ing of “Annie Laurie,” “Old Lang
Sync,” and other Scotch songs.

Mr. James Brown, vice chairman of
the committee, was in charge of the
affair, Mrs. Jessie Farmer and Mrs.
M. Hale were in charge of refresh-
ments and arrangement of the two
tea tables. Miss E, Jamieson, Mrs.

Panther Gets Tail Pulled
Then Yanks Bad Molars

Oakley Climbs Into Panther Skin On Saturdays And
Then His Worries Commence

 

 

By Charles Ruch

Just in case any of the freshmen are still wondering, that
Panther, which cavorts around the Stadium green during the foot-

are wondering who is the power beneath that beastly costume, it’s

looked up from the set of “uppers” he
was modeling in the dental laboratory
to tell about the one time when his
Panther outﬁt did have plenty of ven-
tilation,

It seems that during the Navy game
the three tumblers yanked too fre-
quently upon the Panther’s tail and
one very unceremonious tug separated
the rear assembly of the skin from
its other parts. There was nothing to
do but “hold on,” and that is exactly
what Oakley did fo-r the remainder of
the game. For, after all, it wouldn’t
have been quite proper for the Pan-
ther to ﬁnish his jumping around
while attired in his “underthings.”

The Navy game, incidentally, sur-
passed all other days in the matter of
excitement for Oakley. There was
the Navy goat to fool around with, the
new Panther cub to chaperone, and
Oakley took his ﬁrst crack at climb-
ing the goal-posts. The goat was fair
enougl1—at a distance. The Panther
cub just wouldn’t recognize her old
man, greeting Jack with a baring of
fangs and a few hisses each time he
came close to the cage. Oakley’s
ﬁrst climb of the goal-posts was a
huge success, giving Chuck a really
great thrill, for, he says, “Until that

day I had never been able to climb a

tree.” Oakley maintained this to be
true in spite of the fact that his kid-
hood days were spent in the wilds of
Mt. Washington.

The Dental acrobat made the trips
to Notre Dame and West Virginia for
the games there. At Notre Dame he
had to get the consent of Hunk An-
derson, varsity coach, before he was
allowed to lead the Irish terrier
around the ﬁeld. At West Virginia,
Oakley had been having a pretty hard
day following the “mountaineer” all
over the ﬁeld, running away from a
group of fraternity boys with paddles
until he realized that they merely
wanted to present him with a mascot
cat for the Pitt team, and then, when

he thought it was all over, one of

the little West Virginia rooters just

wouldn’t be satisﬁed until he could
ride around the ﬁeld on the Panther’s
back. The lad was satisﬁed. Oakley
thinks that was the day he “weighed
in” for his afternoon at 145 and came
out of the fray minus four pounds.

Panthers aren't easily scared, but
the Pitt Panther had a real fright be-
tween halves of the Centre game. He
had climbed the goal—posts again and
Jack Wunderley, drum major of the
band, tossed up the baton to him.
Oakley is a little superstitious about
this baton-tossing because there al-
ways seems to be some slip-up. This
time was no exception. The toss was
a little wide and as he reached or the
This
Dent will probably never be so wor-
ried over a patient’s toothache as he
was for the few seconds he struggled
to keep from falling down upon the
band passing beneath the posts. For-
tunately for Mr. Oakley, a few musi-
cians, and several trumpets, the mas-
cot regained his balance. Perhaps, if
it had been saxophones, Oakley would
not have tried so hard. Oakley didn’t
say.

That’s just about all that can be
crowded into a foot-paw sketch of a
Panther. But if there are any others
of this species who have blond, wavy
hair and are ﬁve feet, ten inches tall,
and weigh 145 pounds, they had bet-

Meanwhile, Oakley will continue to

Smile For The Birdie!

N ENTERTAINING PROCEDURE this, photographing

the American Eagle and the Russian Bear! Mr.
Eagle wore his best diplomatic silk hose, and Miss Bear
her best proletarian ﬁnery. Gathered at the photo-
grapher's window making faces at the main characters
of our little drama are “Micky McGuire” Mussolini,
“Trough Boy” Hitler, and “Suave Savant” Daladier. “Lord
Fauntleroy" George sits home playing with his toy cruis-
ers, waiting for the proofs. “Cherry Blossom” Matsuoka
doesn’t like pictures and trains his tin soldiers instead.
The proofs will be ready next month!

It took a lot of time and a lot of trouble for Mr. Roose-
velt and Mr. Litvinoff, ace photographers, to get Mr.
Eagle and Miss Bear to have their picture taken. First,
what would Papa Emanuel, “Mickey McGuire’s” guar-
dian, think? And “Grosspapa” Hindenburg would likely
spank “Tough Boy” if he were caught hobnobbing and
having pictures taken with strange people. So photo-
graphers Roosevelt and Litvinoflf decided several things:

1. The photography business was nothing to brag
about either in Russia or in America. So merging
was the only way out.

2. “Cherry Blossom” Matsuoka practiced unfair
competition against Mr. Litvinoff’s studios, what with
busting up plates, ruining lighting systems, and tak-
ing possessions of whole parts of the studio.

3. “Suave Savant” Daladier still remembered the
Franco—Prussian movie and was making things mis-
erable for “Tough Boy” and “Micky McGuire." Be-
sides, “Micky McGuire” Mussolini has always wanted
to take his gang across the railroad tracks to play
hide and seek in Africa.

So the other day Mr. Eagle and Miss Bear were sum-
moned and had their picture taken. Some people think
Mr. Eagle has fallen for Miss Bear, and why shouldn't
be? Isn't she worth a billion in trade, and isn't that a
princess’ dowry? Then some say that since Mr. Eagle
has won Miss Bear, “Cherry Blossom" Matsuoka will get
sore and start a ﬁght. And that “Little Lord Fauntle-
1'03"’ George Will help him. But they forget that “Cherry
Blossom” has been chiseling in on the Lord’s playground
in India and Australia and that Fauntleroy doesn’t like
it. But Mr. Eagle will probably help Miss Bear no matter
with whom she gets into trouble. Didn't they just have
their picture taken together? And all the granduncles

Comptroller ‘

and second cousins at Geneva think it's a serious busi-
ness.

Photographers Roosevelt and Litvinoff know their
business, however. It looks as though the pictures Will
succeed. The proofs will come from Litvinoff’s studio
soon and Mr. Eagle’s factories will get busy. It’s a nice
picture, no matter how you look at it!

New Prohibition
NTIQUATED, musty, pre-prohibition laws will again
be invoked in colleges and universities throughout
the country with the return of liquor as a legal piece of

merchandise on American markets. Notable among these
ancient reform provisions are those which forbade the
sale of liquor within three or four miles of a college
campus. Notable, too, through the years of prohibition
was the unregulated ﬂow of beverages of all sorts at col-
lege athletic contests and dances.

The University of Wisconsin at the present time per-
mits sale of beer in campus dining halls and in its fa.-
mous old German rathskeller. Other colleges permit not
one drop of beer within miles of the institution.

College and university authorities face a crisis in mak-
ing a decision on the question. Urban universities,
schools that are near business districts where beer and
liquor will be sold openly, face a problem of their own.

The question, in the minds of most college men and
women, is one which asks whether or not these students
are adults and are to be treated as grown-up men and
women. Prohibition failed in the United States, and
everywhere else it was tried, because certain people had

i the idea that other people could not do anything right

until they were forced to. Unless college and university
authorities in American colleges recognize the serious
results that could come from hurried decisions on the
liquor question, many mistakes will be made in devising
regulations for beer and liquor sales on and near
campuses.

American Students Lacking
Work May Turn Radical

English Aluthor Of “Coming Struggle For Power” Calls
Pittsburgh Center Of American Repression

 

 

By Israel L. Goldberg

’ f‘The American student, faced upon graduation with almost
inevltable unemployment, will drift into radicalism, and perhaps

Communism.’ ’

This is the opinion of John Strachey, 32-year-old British author
and publicist, whose ﬁrst major work, “The Coming Struggle for
Power,” attracted world-wide attention early this year.

The youngest prominent member of the famous Strachey family

was in Pittsburgh Friday, addressing¢

  Look Out For Panther! I
Set Loose On Air
Again Tonight

 

According to uncensored radio
time-tables, the Pitt Panther will
prowl again this _evening. The
hour, it is rumored, will again be
9:30 o'clock, and the station,
WWSW.

The irrepressible and irrespon-
sible backers of the so-called pro-
gram have arranged for some-
thing novel this time. Inasmuch
as this news appears once a week,
however, you may as well turn
the dial with your ﬁngers crossed.
Then maybe you won’t get
VVVV SW, after all.

Everything is going to be topsy-

turvy on the broadcast, The only

the League of Vvomen Voters on,
“Can World Capitalism Recover?” A
large crowd, including Pitt students,
heard him predict, in his Carnegie
Music hall speech, the inability of
capitalism to emerge from the pres-
ent crisis.

After he had lunched at the Twenti-
eth Century club, Mr. Strachey was
asked the extent of political activity
among English undergraduates_ “The
well-known Oxford resolution against
war," he said, “is fairly indicative of
the average British student’s attitude.
What is more signiﬁcant is that every
English university except one passed
the same declaration.”

“Radicalism is represented in our
universities," he continued, “by a
small nucleus of Communists, and
many more Communist sympathizers.
The war resolution, you must remem-
ber, does not indicate mere ‘Commun-
ist sentiment. It represents a. much
wider spread of paciﬂsm."

According to the author, who left
Pittsburgh for a lecture tour in the
South, the Scottsboro case attracted a
great deal of attention abroad, He
was particularly interested when told

that M,rs. Pinchot had been forbidden
to speak at Vandergrift, and that
Secretary of Labor Perkins had been
compelled to speak on Federal terri-
tory, the post oﬂice, when she ad-
dressed a steel-workers’ group at
Homestead last summer,

“Of course Pittsburgh, to us, is the
center of American repression,” Mr.
Strachey remarked. “Our university
free speech has not yet been throttled,
but it, too, probably will be before
long.”

In addition to his better—publicized
work, the tall, vigorous Oxford gradu-
ate has just written a new volume,
“The Menace of Fascism,” which ex-
pounds the thesis that fascism is
merely capitalism in disguise. He is
a Communist, though not a member

. of the Communist party.

sane feature will be the singing
of Kit Hall and Jack Lavender.
Even Lucius H. Hassenplug will
not act intelligent. As for the
place in the hour of the society
reporter, Sally Sanderson, and the
Pitt News reeler, Israel Gold-
berg, we can’t guarantee a thing.
It’s been announced that they,
too, will succumb in the campaign
of insanity.

Bureau Aids Students

During the month of October the
employment bureau, according to J.
C. Barton, director, gave employ-
ment to a total of 243 students. These
students have been placed in 54 dif-
ferent kinds of positions which in-
clude everything from blood transfu-
sions to clothing salesmen. There
are still several openings available
for those ambitious enough to apply
for them at the bureau office in Room
801, Cathedral.

Activities Groups’ Organization
Meeting Acquaints Women
With Fellow Workers

Chairmen To Be Elected

The freshman units met for the ﬁrst
time last Friday during the activities
period. The meetings were for the
purpose of getting acquainted both
with the purpose of the speciﬁed
group and also with the girls. Be-
cause of the lack of time, due to the
fact that unit meetings took place
after the freshman mass meeting, no
deﬁnite organization was voted on.

The sports unit, advised by Alice
Rosenberger, Ed35, will elect its chair-
man and secretary after the freshman
class oﬂlcers have been announced.

Mrs_ Robert D. Ayars, director of
the Women’s Glee club, spoke for a
few minutes to the members of the
Glee club unit, Charlotte Logan,-
C35, adviser of the group, followed
Mrs. Ayars’ talk with a few remarks
of her own. At following meetings
Lucille Hamilton, accompanist for the
Glee club, will take the actual direc-
tion of the group.

The publications unit, directed by
Florence King, C35, will elect its of-
floors at a meeting this Friday. They
also plan to discuss the publishing of
a mimographed paper which will be
issued for the freshman women's
mothers’ tea.

At this ﬁrst meeting of the debat-
ing unit, Marjorie Hanson, C34, took
the place of Rosalyn Alexander, Ed35,
who had been appointed student ad-
viser to the group, but who is serious-
ly ill, The activities committee of
WSGA will make 3 lleﬁnite appoint-
ment for this position soon.

The social unit, headed by Mary
Gertrude Herron, Ed35, will begin
functioning in a few weeks.

Alice Elson, C35, is taking charge
of the dramatic unit. No deﬁnite or-
ganization was made Friday.

The literary unit under the direc-
tion of Hazel Lincoln, C35, sponsors
creative writing among the freshmen
themselves, and practices criticism.
The next meeting will take place at
2:30 o’clock tomorrow in Miss Helen
Rush’s oiﬁce.

According to Frieda Goldstein, C35,
tentative programs for the freshman
units will be advanced in a few weeks,

COLLEGE LIFE

 

By EDWARD J. WALDMAN, JR.,
Editoruin-Chief of the Duquesne Duke.

“Three types of men go to college;
those who are willing to be educated,
those who want to be educated, and
those who are determined to be ed-
ucated,” said Newton’ D. Baker, in a
recent address before the student
body of a prominent eastern univer-
sity. Many are in accord with his
views. The individual is the prime
factor in that complex formula em-
ployed in producing education with a
college background.

College life can be made pleasant;
it can be ﬁlled with joys and con-
tentment; it may even ra_diate_warmth
and sunshine to"make the hearts‘ ahd
minds of men rejoice. But college
life alone cannot do these things. Col-
lege life does not take an ordinary
piece of human clay and mold it into
a likeable product. There must be
something behind this clay to lend
inspiration and admiration that do not
exist in just ordinary human clay.
The student himself is the primary
factor that is instrumental in the
production of desired effects in col-
lege life. Teachers may be of the
best and the conditions of the stu-
dent's environment may be harmon-
iously arranged and outlined, but the
student must play his role if he wants
to receive pleasure.

On the other hand, life at college
may be a drudgery; it may be a tire-
some, boresome task; it may be a
mental burden and worry; it may be
just a series of multiple, monotonous
processes and activities, coupled with
a constant dread and fear of class-
room work.

But the student who fails to get a
genuine pleasure out of college life
ha.s no one to blame but himself. The

Letters

Editor, The Pitt News:

Student relations committee is rais-
ing a lot of fuss about its investiga-
tions, but it seems to be ignoring the
need of an investigation of its spon-
sor, Student Council.

To the reader of the News it seems
that Student Council is the most po-
litical of all the organizations on
campus. Perhaps Druids do choose
their members to some extent in view
of their fraternity afﬁliations, but
Council seems to consider men in the
same light.

Particularly do I notice this phase
of politics in the choice of dance
chairmen. Last year three, out of
seven dances were led by members
of Delta Tau Delta. The remaining
four were distributed among Phi
Gamma Delta, Kappa Sigma and Phi
Kappa, and one chairmanship was
given to a non-fraternity man.

This year's dances began with the
College Association Dance, being led
by a member of Delta Tau Delta, al-
though this was, of course, the result
of a general election rather than a
decision of Council. The Sophomore
Hop was chairmaned by a member of

of the coming Interfraternity Con-
ference Dance is also a member. Out
ofthe four “dances whose chairmen
have been chosen this year, the only
one who is not a Delta Tau Delta is
the Kappa Sigma pledge in charge Of
the Freshman Dance.

While I have no doubt that the
chairmen who have been chosen are
as capable of handling their dances
as are the other candidates, it still
stands to reason that they are not
the only men able to do the work. For
instance, one man, who was a Delta
Tau Delta, was in charge of two
dances last year, and it seems reason-
able to assume that there was another
candidate with the same capabilities
who might have been chosen for the
sake of fairness.

Petitioners for the chairmanship of
University functions are coming to
rely more and more on their frater-
nity “pull.” Non-fraternity men and
men belonging to small fraternities
seem to have little or no chance to
show their capabilities. Even the other
“big” fraternities are, more or less,
kept out, because of Council’s per-
fected political system. Council might
well begin its reforms at home and
see that the chairmanship of a dance
is given on merit alone.

Panthers Dominate Play

 

By James Nelson
Pitt News Sports Writer‘

The Panthers dethroned another of
the mythical kings of the football
world in the stadium Saturday by
handing an undefeated and untied
Nebraska team a 6 to 0 setback. The
Pitt team dominated the play from
the start to the ﬁnish. Dana Bible's
team had to be content with only two
invasions into Panther territory. On
one occasion they advanced to the
Pitt 45-yard line and another goal line
thrust was stopped on the Pitt 24.

goal line as they could get 311 after‘

professor in the Industrial Art school
in Budapest.

The chief ornament of the room
will be a painted carpet-picture. The
paints used in this decoration are
color-fast paints produced by a pro-
cess similar to that used to develop
photographic ﬁlm. Alexander M,units,
a professor in the Royal Hungarian
Industrial Artists’ college, will design
and paint the carpet-picture.

The ﬂoor carpet will be of a new
type of rips-woven rug, a material
which cannot become moth-eaten.
Its design will depict the cultural

Panther Runners
Point For AMA

Varsity And Freshman Squads
Grouped Into Four Teams

 

 

Now that the IC—4A meet in New
York yesterday is history, the Pitt
cross—country team is focussing its at-
tention upon the local Allegheny
Mountain association meet to be run
on Saturday. The AMA is a branch
of the Amateur Athletic association
and has upon its enrollment lists the
ﬁnest harrier talent in this district.

The site for this year’s run will be
the Schenley course. This should
greatly enhance the Panther chances
inasmuch as this is their home course,

It is deﬁnitely assured that all the
cross-country men on the varsity and
freshman squads will be entered in
the meet. The combined squads will
be divided into four teams as the Pitt
entries.

For Jim Watkins and Bill Law-
rence, it will be the last chance to
don the Panther spangles in cross-
country competition. Lawrence will
be eligible for indoor and outdoor
track, but Watkins, a mid-year grad-
uate, will hang up his spiked shoes
for the last time after the Saturday
meet.

Pitt Frosh Football
Winning Streak Broken

 

The Little Panthers did not do so
well as their big brothers on Satur-
day, losing to the Tech plebes 12 to
6. It was the ﬁrst time the freshman
football team has been defeated in
two years. Because of the muddy
ﬁeld neither team could make any ap-
preciable gains on running plays. All
the scores were made on passes.

Pitt tallied ﬁrst on a pass from '

Iafolla to O'Neil, who ran 70 yards

for a touchdown. Quarantello failed to-

convert the extra point. Tech scored
when Kopcsak intercepted a pass and
crossed the goal line after an 80-yard
run. Tech scored the winning touch-
down in the third quarter on a pass
from Lorenz to M,cGee who ran 40

yards to score. The lineup:

Sportorial . . . .

By Robert E. Badger
Pitt News Sports Editor
That Boner

Much criticism has been aimed at the officials in the Pitt-Nebraska game
for making an error in downs which may have cost the Panthers a well-
earned victory. To many, including this writer, the mistake was not one‘
to cause all this hue and cry. The error was not one of judgment or of‘
lack of knowledge of the rules, but was simply a mechanical error, entirely
excusable in the excitement of the game.

How excusable it was, may ‘be noted by the fact that none of the Pan-
ther players, who like the oﬂicials were right in the midst of the battle,
apparently noticed the mistake or protested about it. Likewise, very few of
the partisan spectators noticed the mistake.

The sports writers in the press box were on the lookout for such an-
error. Newspapers all over the country have carried stories about mis-
takes made by oﬂicials and about the poor state of oﬂiciating all over the
Ezounttry. Consequently when the mistake was made they were “primed”

or i .

That the boner may have cost the Panthers a victory cannot be denied.

However, they won, so let’s forget about it and give the oﬁicials a break.-
II: :1: II: * =3

-Sauer

All the nice things said about George Sauer, Husker fullback, were true".-
The big boy played a bang-up defensive game and punted for an average of
40 yards. That he didn’t gain a lot of ground was no surprise to anybody
who knows about Sutherland lines.

Christy Walsh, who witnessed the game, remarked that it was too bad?
that Sauer had to run up against that Pitt line as he apparently was a good

ball carrier.

Statistics Again

The statistics of Saturday’s game demonstrated clearly the Panther’s-‘
superiority. They gained 276 yards from scrimmage to 45 gained by the‘
Cornhuskers, and had 17 ﬁrst downs to 7 for the visitors.

They had a net gain of 78 yards from forward passes to 80 for the
Huskers and their punts averaged 38 yards as compared with Sauer’s 40-
yard average.

! Radio Wrongs -

Somebody apparently was wrong at two local radio stations Saturday
for sports announcers at both stations in summarizing the Pitt-Nebraska:
game made much of the fact that Nebraska twice drove to the Panther 2-
yard line only to be stopped by “a valiant Panther forward wall.” Most of
us who saw the game missed these plays.

Frosh Stars

Standing out in the playing of the Fresh in their defeat in a sea of mud
Saturday morning at Tech Bowl was the playing of O’Neil. The little half-
back who prepped at Kiski c-utran the entire Tech backﬁeld when he took‘.
Iafolla’s pass for a touchdown.

To many, Quarantello’s judgment in calling for passes after the Pan-
ther Cubs had gained a. one touchdown lead seemed questionable. The re»
sult of the passes was disastrous, for Kopcsak intercepted one and galloped
for a touchdown to knot the score.

In Kelley, a center, the Tech Plebes showed a very promising prospect.
On defense, he backed up the line, and set the Panther backs down very
ungently.
