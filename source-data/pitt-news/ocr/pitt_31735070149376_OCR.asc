Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

After more than four months of investiga-
tion, law enforcement officials have ﬁled
an indictment against the man the state
attorney general says was behind more
than 50 bomb threats at Pitt.

At a press conference on Wednesday
at the FBI ﬁeld office in the South Side,
David Hickton, United States attorney
for the Western District of Pennsylvania,
announced two indictments against Adam
Stuart Busby, 64, of Dublin, Ireland, for
emailing bomb threats targeting Pitt, three
federal courthouses and a federal officer.

“Busby has been charged with email-

A ing numerous, anonymous bomb threats
targeting the University of Pittsburgh this -

past spring,” Hickton said. “The bomb
threats caused more than 100 evacuations
at Pitt, greatly disrupting the personal and
professional lives of students, faculty and
employees.”

Between Feb. 13 and April 21 of this
year, Pitt received 52 individual bomb
threats resulting in 136 evacuations of

University buildings.

Hickton said that Busby is responsi-
ble for the more than 40 emailed threats
that were aimed at Pitt’s campus between
March 30 and April 21. Most of those
threats were sent to media outlets in the
area, including the Pittsburgh Post-Ga-
zette and the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.

Busby was indicted on charges of 17
counts of wire fraud, 16 counts of mali-
ciously conveying false -information and
two counts of international extortion".

A second indictment charged Busby
with maliciously conveying false informa-
tion through the Internet onjune 20 and
21 by claiming that bombs were placed
at federal courthouses in Erie, Pa., John-
stown, Pa. and Pittsburgh.

He was also charged with threatening "A

to assault and murder Hickton while the
U.S. attorney was performing his ofﬁcial
duties, but no speciﬁcs as to how those

threats were, sent were discussed at the -

press conference.

Hickton said that the maximum sen-
tence for each count of wire fraud is 20
years in prison, the maximum penalty for

maliciously conveying false information
is 10 years in prison and the maximum
penalty for_extorti0nate threats is two
years. Hickton saideach felonious count
attributed to Busby also carries a maxi-
mum $250,000 fine. A
Busby is currently in custody in Ireland

_. for unrelated charges, which Hickton said

he could not comment on at this time.

Hickton declined to comment on the
details of the investigation, but he did say
that Busby had been a suspect since mid-
April. He added that there are no known
connections between Busby and the Uni-
versity that he is currently aware of.

“We' don’t get into the mind of the
criminal,” he said. ‘

Chancellor Nordenberg responds

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg spoke
after Hickton at Wednesday’s press confer-
ence, expressing relief and gratitude" for
the capture of the man behind the spring
bomb threats against Pitt. '

“The timing to reach this point before
we begin a new academic year is very bene-

   Man from Ireland charged in making Pitt bomb threats

ﬁcial for the University,” Nordenberg said.

He said that hiring extra security
guards, paying overtime for police officers
and procuring the types of equipment to
detect explosives all added to the total bill
for threat response. He put the ﬁnancial
cost of security and police response to
the bomb threats at upward of $300,000.

But he also noted the other costs as-

sociated with the threats, including lost '

time for faculty members, lost opportuni-

ties for students and time invested by law

enforcement organizations other than

the Pitt police, as additional, incalculable
‘costs of the threats.

“If we were able to calculate’ those
things, the amount would be much larger,”
he said. . '

N ordenberg then thanked all those
involved in the investigation, including
Pitt police, city of Pittsburgh police and
the FBI. He also praised students and pro-
fessors for “their strength and resiliency
displayed during a time of crisis.”

. His praises were echoed by Hickton.

New head ofadmissions aimsto not just recruit, but retain

Joe Chilson
Staﬁ" Writer

As Marc Harding rode the elevatorto the sec-
ond ﬂoor of Alumni Hall, he metahigh school
senior visiting Pitt for the day.

Though the young male student slouched -
unassumingly behind his father as if trying
to blend in with the elevator walls, Harding,
Pitt’s new chief enrollment officer, extended
his hand and a greeting, asking him how old
he was and what he thought of the -school
that Harding himself is just coming to know.

The elevator ride lasted but a minute, but
in that time, the beginnings of a personal re-
lationship were formed.

Marc Harding was hired to head Pitt’s Of-
ﬁce of Admissions and Financial Aid when the
former director of the admission office, Betsy
Porter, retired after 26 years of service. As
head of the oflice, Harding will be responsible
for attracting and retaining classes of students.

Debbie Rupert, senior assistant director of
Admissions and Financial Aid, said Harding is

already popular with his colleagues.

Rupert said that no one grows up dreaming
about getting into the ﬁeld of admissions and
ﬁnancial aid, but for people who ﬁnd them-
selves moving in that direction, it can be a
very fulﬁlling job._ A

“Once you do it for a few years, it’s in your
blood and you do it forever,” Rupert said.

Harding certainly didn’t run around in
his Massachusetts backyard as a boy playing

’ dean of admissions, but he has still forged a

decades—long career in the ﬁeld.

Harding attended college at the Univer-
sity of Massachusetts, studying business. His
father owned a string of automotive parts
stores, and Harding said he originally felt
that following in his father’s footsteps might
not be such a bad path. But soon, he said, he
found out that business wasn’t his passion.-

He moved to education, where he student-
taught elementary school for a few years, but
that, too, didn’t feel quite right. _

“I think I was sort of denying who my inner
me was,” Harding said.

So he took a class in communications and
discovered a love for interpersonal commu-
nication. He expanded on that love by eam—
ing a degree in communications with minors
in psychology and Chinese from UMass and
eventually landed a job in the school’s admis-
sions office.

“I got todo aspirational things in terms
of helping students succeed,” Harding said,
referring to working with students, setting
up programming and speaking with people.
“All that was just a grand mix to me  after
three years of doing that stuff, I was in love.”

Harding spent ﬁve years at UMass, moved
on to Virginia Tech for three years, the Univer-
sity of South Florida for ﬁve and then spent 15
years working at the University of Iowa. This
year, he moved his things into an office at Pitt.

Harding sees what an admissions ofﬁce
does as cultivating the very unique relation-

ship that exists between students and their
university. “

Harding said that when students set out
to look at colleges, they’re shopping -— set-
ting out to purchase a product. But after they
graduate, he said, something changes. As
alumni, students become an extension of the
school they chose. They become the product
they sought. ' \

“That’s always given me pause and reason
to take this relationship that we’re trying to
build very seriously,” Harding said. "0

So when Harding sets his mind to building
a freshman class, he conceptualizes it not as
recruiting students, but as creating future
alumni. Harding’s goal is not just to persuade
potential students to’ come to Pitt, but to in-
form them as to what sort of place Pitt is and
to seek out the ones that will mesh well into
its family. ' _

In order to make sure that Pitt’s brand isn’t
misrepresented and students who pick Pittwill
be a good match, Harding said he likes to en-
courage campus visits. That way, prospective
students and parents have a chance to make
connections with students and faculty that
share their interests and concerns.

“It’s a pretty serious thing, this college
choice  it’s our job to represent the brand as
Well, if not better, than anyone, but never to
misrepresent it, so that students can get the
best sense of who we are. It becomes part of
their very fabric, because they’ll be alumni

someday,” Harding said.

« Chief.EnrolIment Officer Marc Harding

Rupert, who has worked in admissions
for 28 years, agrees with this recruiting style.

“We' don’t do, like some schools, a hard
sell, because not only do we want to recruit
them, we want to retain them,” Rupert said.

Though retainment isn’t particularly a
problem at Pitt, Harding said he realizes that

Student Health, Counseling Center to-be placed in new dorm

Michael Ringling
Assistant News Editor

When Pitt’s new, yet—to-be-named dorm is
completed in the fall of 2013, students will no
longer need to travel between two buildings to
ﬁilﬁll their mental and physical health needs.

The University’s Student Health Ser-
vices, currently located on the ﬁfth ﬂoor of
the UPMC-owned Medical Arts Building on
Fifth Avenue, and the Counseling Center, now
situated on the third ﬂoor of the William Pitt
Union, will unite to form the Wellness Center,
to be located on the second ﬂoor of the newly
constructed dorm at 121 University Place. The
Student Health pharmacy will be moved to
the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the new buildingand will fea-
ture street—level access.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele said that the
building’s estimated cost has remained at $59
million -— as originally announced — and
will house 559 freshmen on 10 ﬂoors when it
opens its doors in fall 2013.

Marian Vanek, the director of Student
Health Services, said that the center’s current
location isn’t ideal for its patients.

For one, she said, the current center can-
not overtly advertise outside of the building,

’ and it also must pay a lease to use the facility.

Vanek said she was unauthorized to give spe-

ciﬁc ﬁgures concerning the cost of the lease
but said the new facility will be “cost-saving.”

The layout of the Wellness Center will fea-
ture 18 examination rooms around a central-
ized nursing station. Vanek, who contributed
to the design of the new facility, said that this
was an improvement over the layout of the
center at the Medical Arts Building.

She said she was particularly excited about“

the connection between Student Health and
the Counseling Center.

“Many patients we see in the Health Cen-
ter have a mental-health component,” Vanek
said, adding that the Counseling Center’s in-
clusion in the Wellness Center will allow for
easier travel between the two service provid-
ers.

“We believe in the mind-body connec-
tion,” Vanek said. -

Teyva Zukor, the director of the Counsel-

ing Center since last September, is also excited ~

about the relocation. He said it will make for
easier’ and quicker cross-referrals between
the mental and physical departments of the
Wellness Center.

“Certainly for us, we refer to the Health

V Center to rule out any physiological cause,”

Zukor said, adding that~after the relocation,

he and his staff “can walk people to the Health

Center.” ‘ .
While his department frequently sends

students over to the Health Center for a physi-
cal examination, he said students are also sent
his way for various ailments. .
Oﬁzentimes when students have a panic at-
tack or are dealing with depression, they head

. to their medical doctor, Zukor said. But these

ailments often involve a mental component,
and are therefore better handled by one of
the Counseling Center’s two full-time psychia-
trists. I

Rainbow Alliance ﬁles revised complaint regarding transgender policy

Em Maier ~
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

Seamus Johnston and Tricia Dougherty are
not backing down in the complaints they
launched against the University, both involv-
ing the use of Pitt’s facilities for transgender
students.

Johnston, a former Pitt student,'and
Dougherty, the Rainbow Alliance presi-
dent, both ﬁled complaints against Pitt to
Pittsburgh’s Commission on Human Rela-
tions, which has resulted in back-and-forth
reports from both parties as to whether Pitt
engaged in discriminatory practices. The
commission, after receiving the complaints,
launched investigations to determine the
validity of the allegations. Typical investi-
gations aim for conciliation but frequently
result in litigation and punitive ﬁnes, ac-
cording to Commission Director Charles
Morrison.

Dougherty ﬁled a complaint with the
commission on April 25 of this year, claiming
that Pitt enacted “discriminatory practices
relating to public accommodation” towar
transgender students. ' ‘

The organization objected to the Uni-
versity announcing a policy stating that all
transgender students must use gendered
facilities according to the sex listed on their
birth certiﬁcates. The new policy requires
that students who wish to use facilities des-
ignated for the opposite sex ﬁrst undergo

sexual reassignment surgery, a costly and
invasive procedure. Previously, the Univer-
sity had no stated policy governing the use
of gendered facilities, allowing for more
ﬂexibility in practice. i
Pitt had responded with_a motion to
dismiss the complaint, due to the lack of
a speciﬁc incident or discriminatory act.
Dougherty and others in the community
had implied a larger impact by the policies.
The Rainbow Alliance tried again, sub-
mitting a reworked complaint on July 27,
featuring a more developed case as well as
arguing with the University’s issues with the
lack of identiﬁed members. The new com-
plaint cited articles as well as past decisions
disputing the need to publicly identify the
speciﬁc individuals injured and discrimi-
nated. ' ,
The impact Rainbow Alliance referred
to had extended all the way to the branch
campus of Johnstown, where, in January,
Pitt expelledJohnston, a 22-year-old female-
bodied pre—op transgender person, for re-
peated indecent exposure,-deﬁant trespass
and disorderly conduct after he showered
and changed in a men’s locker room on
campus. '
The FBI subpoenaed Johnston and his
partner, Katherine Anne Mccloskey, 56,
inJuly regarding the investigation into the
string of more than 140 bomb threats the
University received from February to April
last semester.
Johnston has maintained his innocence,

protesting that he was being unfairly tar-
geted due to his status. ‘ ’
In response, on April 17,J0hnston ﬁled a

V complaint with the Pittsburgh Human Re-
_lations Commission about the University’s

policy. Pitt had replied with a motion to dis-
miss, on the grounds of jurisdiction, because
his expulsion occurred at a branch campus.
Morrison had conﬁrmed that the com-
mission would have jurisdiction, due to the
universal policies the University has in place.
An investigation, provided jurisdiction
exists, would entail communications with
various branches of the offending organi-
zation, as well as a more closed means of
determining if discrimination occurred.
Working with both parties, the commission
would try to ‘peacefully resolve the situation.
If reconciliation isn’t reached, the matter is
pursued, potentially resulting in ﬁnes, litiga-
tion or hearings. Fines issued are variable.
Morrison also suggested that the Univer-
sity could begin dealing with pressure from
other universities and schools that have
more accommodating and ﬂexible policies.
Pitt spokesman Robert Hill said in an
email that the school does not comment on

‘ pending litigation. —

“The University has not discriminated
against anyone,” he said.

Johnston had initially fought the expul-
sion, but resigned to taking a deal known
as Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition,
or ARD, in which he would go straight to

. probation without a guilty verdict.

“I’m disappointed not to prove my case in
court, but I realized it was taking too long.
I could lose the opportunity to bring action
against Pitt,”Johnston’said. ‘

But he continued to work on his discrimi-
nation litigation against Pitt, a case that
has yet to go to trial. Due to the extensive
preparation the case requires,Johnston said

- he will not be resuming college this fall.

Despite the policy obstructions and

J litigation, Johnston said he still desires to ‘

return to his alma mater, even if it takes a
court order. .

“I’m continuing to ﬁght Pitt for my edu-
cation, despite the dozens of road blocks
thrown in my way,” Johnston said.

In the midst of the controversy and sim-
mering litigations, the University Senate
proposed an ad hoc committee to look into
and create policies regarding transgender
people at Pitt. However, on May 9, the cre-
ation was postponed in order to avoid legal
complications regarding the complaints
issued against the University. '

Senate Council President Michael Pinsky
had planned to task the committee with
examining relevant policies in the state and
other institutions, with the goal of forging a

new set of policies that would consider the

needs of both the transgenderpopulation
as well as the faculty and students of the
university.

The Universitymaintained that the com-
mittee would not meet while there was on-
going litigation. ] A

Pitt, CMU still Waiting
L for distribution of
Dietrich’s

Pitt has yet to receive any payout

' from the $125 million donation be-

queathed _to the University by W'1l-
liam S. Dietrichll last September, but
plans are already well underway for
how the funds will be managed once
they have been received.

Although Dietrich’s donation be-
came operational upon his death in
October2011, funds from the endow-
ment might not arrive at Pitt until

» early next year. But both ﬁnancial

representatives of Dietrich’s estate
and Pitt officials say that the lag in
ﬁind dispersal is to be expected with
such a sizable contribution.

Last fall, the late Pitt alumnus set
the record for the largest monetary
donation in Pitt’s history when he
announced his gift on Sept. 22. The
contribution came shortly after
Dietrich’s announcement of a $225
million donation to Carnegie ‘Mel-
lon University, and both institutions
quickly renamed their largest col-
leges in honor of the donor’s parents

—— Pitt christening the Kenneth L.'

Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences,
and CMU announcing the Marianna
Brown Dietrich College of Humani—
ties and Social Sciences. However,
neither university has received any
actual money.

N.]ohn Cooper, dean of the Diet—
rich School of Arts 8: Sciences, said
the delay isn’t cause for concern.

,“Any estate on this sort of scale

. takes some time to set up, and the ap-

propriate foundation forthat process
is not yet complete,” he said.

CMU spokeswoman Teresa
Thomas said in an email that the
delay in payout from the operation-
al funds also falls in line with her

donation

school’s expectations.

Edward J. Grefenstette, chief
investment ofﬁcer ofthe Dietrich
Charitable Trusts, said in an email

that whilethe vehicle for charitable ~

fund dispersal — The Dietrich Foun-
dation —- is currently formed, it has
yetto befunded. He said that there is;
however, a timetable in place for the
completion of the funding process.
“There are certain regulatory, tax
and administrative requirements
that must be satisﬁed before the Di-
etrich Charitable Trusts can fund The
Dietrich Foundation,” Grefenstette
said. “We are hopeful that the founda-
tion’s funding can take place around
year-end, meaning that the ﬁrst of the
annual distributions to the founda-
tion’s supported organizations will
likely begin in the ﬁrst half of 2013.”
Pitt and CMU will receive the
ﬁinds from the Dietrich Charitable

Trusts, which was created from as- -

sets generated by the sale of Dietrich
Industries in 1996 andwillﬁmd The
Dietrich Foundation.

“It is expected that, in aggregate,
approximately 3 percent of the foun-
dation’s total assets will be distribut-
ed annually,” Grefenstette said. “The
University of Pittsburgh is expected
to receive 25 percent of the amount
of each armual distribution made by
the foundation.” .

As University officials await pay-
out from the largest gift in Pitt his-
tory, they face state and University
regulations forthe use of funds as en-
dowed gifts. The amount of endow-
ment “income” available for spend-
ing is determined by the Investment
Committee of Pitt’s Board ofTrustees
and is governed by Pennsylvania law.

the Sikh temple in Oak Creek,‘

Wis., before the gunman fatally
shot himself, her ﬁrst reaction
was shock. ' b

At the time of the attack,
Ghotra, 60, who resides in
Chandigarh, India, was visit-
ing her son in Milwaukee, only
about 30 minutes from where
the attack took place.

Before the Aug. 5 shooting,
she and other family members
had planned on going to the Oak
Creek temple later in the day.
Those plans quickly changed as
news of the attack emerged;

“Maybe God was protecting
us,” Ghotra said quietly, sorrow

‘ audible in her voice.

Ghotra was one of more
than 300 people, both Sikhs
and members of other religious
and nonreligious communities,
who attended a vigil on Aug.
11 at the Pittsburgh Sikh Gurd-
wara in Monroeville for the six
victims of the Oak Creek at-
tack. Along with hymns from
the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh
scripture, the service included
prayers for the victims, speak-
ers and a candle—lighting cer-
emony. The vigil began a little
after 7:30 p.m. and lasted more

than anlhour an_d a half.

The speakers included not

only members of the temple’s
sangat, or congregation, but
also elected officials and other
guests from outside the Sikh
community. All expressed a

message of solidarity with the
victims and with members of
the Sikh faith as a whole.
Chitratan Singh Sethi, a
member of‘ the executive com-
mittee of the gurdwara (a Sikh
temple), opened the service in
front of the somber audience
that had gathered, most of its
members sitting cross-legged

facing the altar, which was
draped in white cloth embroi-
dered in red.

“On Sunday, Aug. 5, we saw
the darkest side of mankind,”
Sethi said, expressing grief that
a place of worship could be the
scene of such senseless violence.

He went onto praise the Oak
Creek police, who responded to
the attack — especially -Lt. Brian

. Murphy, the ﬁrst officer to arrive
on the scene. Murphy sustained
nine gunshot wounds during the
attack.

Sethi concluded his remarks
by thanking those guests from
other,” religious backgrounds,
government officials and the
community at large for the soli-
darity it had shown following
the attack. ‘ ’ l '

“The Sikh community has
been touched during the last few
days by the outpouring of sup-
port from the nation,’—’ he said.

Following Sethi’s' remarks, . l
T‘ Bhai Sahib Sucha Singh, a priest

at the temple, led hymns and a‘
prayer in Gurmukhi, the form of
Punjabi in which Sikh scripture
is written.

Sucha Singh then outlined l

the history and beliefs of Sikh-
ism, which he said originated in

northern ‘India in the 16th cen- ’

News Editor

In order to make renovations to
the University Book Center, the
campus textbook retailer has
been relocated from its Fifth
Avenue location to 3601 Forbes
Ave. for the fall and spring se-

' mesters.

The Book Center manager
Debra Fyock said the renova-
tions will not affect the book-
store’s ability to carry every
required textbook, or affect its ’
delivery to on-campus students.
Off-campus residents who or-

dered textbooks online will be
able to pick them up at the old‘
location on Fifth Avenue for this

semester. -

The Book Center will also
carry required lab materials,
such as lab goggles.

Fyock said the only major
exterior change will be to the
Schenley Quad Entrance, which
will be moved closer to the Fifth
Avenue side of the building.

The interior of the building
will have an entirely new look.

“We will have two major
checkout areas set up to accom-

- modate the increased volume

of customers during rush. Way-

ﬁnding signage and computers
strategically placed throughout
the store will help our customers

navigate the space with ease,”

Fyock said. .

The renovated store will
include places to study, a cof-
fee shop, new technology and
a textbook “guru” to answer
questions.‘

Fyock‘ said the remodeled
bookstore will also be able to
hold after-hours events, such as
book signings and department
showcase events.

The Book Center is expected
to be fully renovated and re-

opened by the fall of 2013. I

Uptown Girls: Longtime resident

Dolores David stands in her temporary living space that once used to be her and her husband’s

Even students who got away from campus
over the summer could still ﬁnd them-
selves in hot water with the University if
they broke the law —— depending on the
nature oftheir crimes.

The University’s Code of Conduct me-
ticulously outlines students’ rights, the
procedures for disciplinary action against
University students and the composition
of the authorities that hear disciplinary
cases. These include the Hearing Officers,
the Judicial Board and the University Re-
view Board. Even when students are away
from school on holidays or breaks, the

rules‘ still apply.

This is Because the code doesn’t just.

concern itself with the actions of students
that affect their academics or occur on
University property. Instead, it includes
provisions that allow the University to
punish students for infractions that may
fall outsidePitt’s boundaries.

Page 7 of the Code of Conduct lists three
broad categories of offenses for which the
University may discipline a student, even

. when he or she commits them outside the

bounds of the University campus. One of
these categories deals with infractions
considered “grave offenses,” which Uni-
versity spokesman John Fedele said may
include alleged serious felonies committed

by students.

 

“Fortunately, because of our gener-

allywell-behaved students, this is rarely A

invoked,” he said in an email.

According to the same section of the
code,’ other offenses for which students
may face disciplinary procedures from the
University, even when they commit them
off-campus, include those that endanger
fellow students‘ or other Pitt affiliates and
offenses students commit while within the
jurisdiction of the Pitt police.

Fedelesaid that this area includes, ev-
erything within 500 yards of any property
owned or controlled by the University.

mote asense ‘of accountability but’th“at
the University should tailor its reaction

This past summer; four Pitt engi-
neering students won comedian
Stephen Colbert’s Super PAC Fun
Pack Challenge. The grand prize?
Stephen ColbertwillvisitPitt. To win
the challenge, the students created
their own Super PAC and went on a 5
adventure to recover a 101-year— old
piece of treasure. This is the story of
the treasure hunt. '

For the Pitt treasure hunters, the
journey of a lifetime began with a
single moment of serendipity.

Pitt engineering graduate stu-
dent Dan Stough turned on his TV_
and watched “The Colbert Report.”

Usually, Stough said, he doesn’t
have time to watch the satirical po-
litical show, but on this particular
March evening, he happened to
ﬁnd the time. And on this episode,
Stephen Colbert happened to be
introducing a contest.

_ Stough watched as Colbert told
viewers about the Colbert Super PAC
Fun Pack, a package of political-
themed activities that featured a
treasure hunt for an enigmatic silver
turtle.

“When I saw the Super PAC~Fun

August 22, 2012 I The Pitt News l \M/vvx/.pittnevvs.oom

X Marks the Spot: Students discover Co|bert’s hidden treasure

Pack I thought, you know this is
probably something that would be
a good waste of time for everybody,
and so I bought it immediately, the
same day,” Stough said.

Once the PAC package arrived,
ﬁlled with maps, clues and direc-
tions for how to begin his very own
Super PAC, Stough sent out a mass
email seeking help from his fellow
Pitt students in ﬁnding the treasure.

Three fellow Pitt engineering»

students jumped on the opportu-
nity.

Recent Pitt graduates Daniela
Aizpitarte and Ben Zaczek, along
with graduate engineering student
Justine Buchman, joined Stough in
his quest for the silver turtle. Stough
put all the maps and clues included
in the Super PAC Fun Pack onto a
digital dropbox so that all four team
members could work on the clues
simultaneously.

With a decoder ring, a direction
book for how to set up a Super PAC
and a map of the U.S., including pic-
tures and colored arrows denoting
routes through various states, the
group set out to discover the loca-
tion of their treasure. '

On a pure hunch, Stough decided
.to look at the source code of the con-
test’s web page for ahidden clue. He

discovered a message.

“Read everything carefully,” it
advised.

“If you read through these things
very carefully,” Buchman said,
pointing to the map and contest’s
directions, “That’s when you can
ﬁnd the weird stuff.” .

In reading through the rule book
for creating a Super PAC, the team
discovered a portion where letters
were strangely bolded or italicized.
The bold and italicized letters
spelled out the nonsensical phrase
“Massachusetts Upper Right.”

Stough used the decoder ring in-
cluded in the pack to discover the
meaning of a set of numbers on the
bottom right of the U.S. map. The
number code translated to “over
the land of the free.”

On the bottom left corner of the
map, Zaczek noticed strange sym-
bols written on the body of a dragon.
Buchman took a picture of the sym-
bols and,,using Google Goggles,_ a
picture-based web-search engine,
learned they were Masonic symbols
that translated to “something.”

The group noticed strange
breaks. in the border surrounding
the rule book Colbert sent them.
They suspected that the breaks were
Braille or Morse Code. After trying

to translate for both, they came up
empty on that clue.
At the beginning of April,’ Col-'

. bert also aired a clue on his show to

launch the competition. He ﬂashed
a multilayered series of horizon-
tal and vertical lines on the screen
during his broadcast. The Pitt team
realized that the colors of the lines
on screen matched the colors of the
arrows printed on the treasure map,
but they weren’t sure what to make
of the connection.

“The codes we had in the kit, we
had mostly ﬁgured out by the very
end of April,” Stough said.

“But we didn’t know exactly what I

they all meant.”

Soon, the month of April came
to a close, just as the team members
found themselves stalled in their
ability to determine any more clues.
Stough headed abroad for a few

' weeks while his teammates began

summer j obs. The treasure hunt was
pushed to the back burner.

While on hiatus, the team kept
an eye on their competition .— the
people in ownership of the 999 oth-
er Super PAC Fun Packs. The team
took particular interest in agroupt
of Penn State students also work-

. ing to solve the puzzle. Stough and
‘ company said the Penn State group _

was putting a lot of effort into the
challenge, posting on their 'I‘umblr

| blog page that it had hired a lawyer «

to help manage and develop the
Super PAC.
' “What was on this 'kid’s Tumblr

was crazy,” Aizpitarte said. “He was -

saying 200 people showed up to one
of their meetings to ﬁgure this out
and we were like ‘oh my god’ because
it’s just the four of us.”

On June 9, after a month-long
break, the Pitt treasure hunters
found their way back on track when
a new clue was sent out from “The
Colbert Report” via email.

“Their plan from the start was
to start giving people clues every
month or so if no one found it, be-
cause they wanted someone to ﬁnd
it before the fall,” Stough said.

The new clue was a classic puz-
zle: a word search. In completing
the word search, a handful of letters
weren’t circled. These letters spelled
out: “The answer you are seeking is
written in the stars.”

“The day after is when I had, like
an epiphany that it had to do with
stars and the ﬂag,” Stough said.

This realization kicked the
team’s problem solving into hyper

WASHINGTON —- Rep. Paul
Ryan’s proposed federal budget —
now starring as the centerpiece
of the presidential campaign as
he joins the Republican ticket

—- would reshape American gov— '

ernment, achieving long—sought
conservative goals and reversing
an 80-year path of larger, more
expensive federal programs.

Under Ryan’s plan, which has
passed the Republican-controlled
House twice in slightly different
versions, the Internal Revenue
Service would tax the wealthi-
est Americans less, but many of
the poorest ones more; Medicare
would be transformed; Medicaid
would be cut by about a third, and
all functions of government other
than those health programs, Social
Security and the military would
shrink to levels not seen since the
19305.

Mitt Romney has made a point

, . . . . . . . . . . , q — . < v . . . 1

of saying that he’s running on his
own budget, not Ryan’s, but even
before choosing him as a running

mate, he had adopted much of Ry-i I
an’s plan. Romney’s tax plan would ‘

reduce tax rates by less, but closely
resembles Ryan’s,.and so do his
plans for Medicare, Medicaid and
other safety-net programs.

The Ryan plan would not bal-
ance the federal budget for an-
other 28 years at least, according
to an analysis by the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Ofﬁce. That
means the federal-debt would con-
tinue to rise. That’s partly because
the tax cuts take effect right away
while the Medicare cuts kick in
later, as people now 55 hit retire-
ment age. It’s also partly because
Ryan’s proposed tax cuts consider-
ably outweigh even his ambitious
spending reductions.

Ryan himself concedes that his
plan would not balance the bud-
get this decade, predicting it could
be balanced by the “mid-to-early
2o2os” because his plan would ig-
nite rapid economic growth. Like

his onetime mentor, Jack Kemp,
the 1996 Republican vice presi-

: dential nominee, Ryan argues that

the key to economic growth is not
balancing the budget, but lowering
tax rates.

“Growth is the key to ﬁscal ‘sus-
tainability —— and low rates are the
key to growth,” he said.

But even if low tax rates spur
the economy — a debatable point‘
among economists —— a balanced
budget will depend on wiping

enough tax breaks off the books i

to offset the new tax cuts.

In the more than two years.
since his budget was unveiled, Ryan .

has_not speciﬁed any tax breaks
he would eliminate. Independent
analyses have shown that offset-
ting the tax cuts would require
changing things such as the mort-
gage interest deduction, the tax
exclusion for employer-ﬁnanced
health insurance or other popu-
lar tax preferences widely used by

_ middle-income households.

For any of these changes to take
place, of course, Romney and Ryan

s » . : . , . ,

would have to win the election and
probably carry a Republican Sen-
ate with them.

Republicans hope the Ryan
budget will propel their campaign
forward, grabbing the mantle of
“change” away from President
Barack Obama. Democrats fervent-
ly believe Ryan’s plan will become a
major weapon for their side.

Medicare

Ryan would shift Medicare from
a system in which everyone gets
the same set of beneﬁts, paid for
by tax funds, to one in which the
government would give each senior
citizen a ﬁxed amount of money.

When people now 55 or young-
er reach retirement, they would
be given the option of using that

“premium support” payment, or A

voucher, to buy private insurance
policies or enroll in Medicare.
The amount of the payment
would vary from one region of the
country to another, depending on
the cost of private insurance plans.

o.l5'-

  Ryan’s fiscal-vision would reshape the nation

In someplaces, at least in the early
years, the premium—support pay-
ment might cover the full cost_of
Medicare, but there’s no guarantee
of that. ,

Ryan would also gradually lift
the Medicare eligibility age from
6sto 67 by 2034.

' Supporters say the premium-
support approach would hold down
the federal government’s spending

on health care, since seniors would V -

have an incentive to shop for the
cheapest plans and competition
among private health plans would
push costs down. But critics argue
that elderly sick people aren’t likely
to be good comparison shoppers
and could easily be misled by com-
plicated insurance programs.

Detractors» also say health in- ’

surers would have a huge incen-
tive to create” low-cost plans for

- younger, healthier seniors, leaving

Medicare with the oldest, sickest
patients and driving up its costs.
Medicare beneﬁciaries have av-

The Student Government Board are
some of the most visible leaders on
campus and hold the purse strings
to the seven ﬁgure sums of money
allocated to students. And while
they might be busy student leaders,
The Pitt News wanted to start the
year by looking at the personalities
behind the positions.

James Landreneau

Position: President

Year: Senior “
Major: Chemical Engineering

Originally from Wexford, Penn-
sylvania Landreneau was intro-
duced to student government as a
sophomore interning for past Board
member David Gau. But itwas this
past year that he really got involved.

“I was asked by former SGB
President Molly Stieber to run with
her slate as a Board member,” Lan-
dreneau said in an email. “I was ex-
tremely excited to serve my fellow
students.”

Fun fact:

Landreneau’s parents had athing
for the letter J. Each of his siblings’
names begins with the letter, and
with seven of them, his family tree
begins to look like a Dr. Seuss book.

“My siblings, in order, are: Je-

zrome, John, Joshua, Jordan, Jude

andJackson.” Landreneau said. “[It]
can get pretty confusing for my par-
entsl”

Megan Carlene McGrath
Position: President Pro Tempore '
Year: Senior
Major: Economics, minor in politi-
cal science

McGrath started her career in
Pitt politics by joining an SGB com-
mittee when she was a sophomore.

“I kept thinking of projects I
would like to work on if I was on
boar ,” McGrath said. “I wanted
the chance to actually work on those
things, so I decided to run.”

Drinkofchoice:
- “Blue Moons, Wednesdays at

Hemingway’s.”

Olivia Armstrong
Position: Board Member
Year: Senior
Major: Health and Physical Activity
Armstrong said she reluctantly
ran for SGB after originally shying
away from the added work and re-
sponsibility that the position would
bring. _
“I tend to say yes to everything
and I was trying to not spread myself

August 22, 2012 | The Pitt News I wvvx/\/.pittnevvs.com

Election car will

too thin,” Armstrong said. “I usually
prioritize extra curricular activities
over my academic work, which is a
terrible habit.”
Weirdest food ever tried:

“The weirdest thing I’ve ever

eaten is a tie between alligator and,

escargot,” Armstrong said.

During one of her yearly trips to
Sanibel Island, Florida she ordered
fried alligator at a local restaurant.

“It was pretty much just chewy
chicken.” -

Alex Murdoch

Position: Business Manager
Year: Senior

Major: Accounting

Murdoch didn’t set out to get in-
volved in SGB, but when he ﬁnally
decided to run he didn’t tell Megan
McGrath, his friend since 4th gade.

“She had been very open about
running and I decided to keep quiet
for strategic reasons,” Murdoch
said.

Secret study spot:

At the end of the walkway be-
tween Towers and Posvar there is an
elevator. On the fourth ﬂoor of that
elevator there is a table with ﬁve of
six chairs.

“No one is ever there and there
are plenty of outlets,” Murdoch said.

Julie Hallinan
Position: Board Member
Year: Senior
Major: Economics, Leadership, Pub-
lic and Professional Writing and Po-
litical Science '
After Hallinan saw the difference
she could make while serving as vice
president of her high school senior
class, she arrived at Pitt with student
government aspirations. But like
many new students she spent her
freshman year getting her bearings.
Hallinan got her start in student

government as a sophomore. She"

served on the environmental com-
mittee afcer applying to two chair
positions and beingturned down for
both. As a junior Hallinan decided
to run for SGB. ’
Cartoon and cereal of choice:
Hallinan said she used to love
Lucky Charms, Recess and Pep-
per Ann but to this day still loves
Spongebob Squarepants. _
. “It will be on mute while I’m do-
ing my homewor ,” Halinan said.

Natalie Rothenberger
Position: Board Member
Year: Senior
Major: Politics-Philosophy and The-
atreArts .
As a freshman activities Rothen-

berger and her roommate picked up

  Getting to know SGB members

ﬂyers about SGB and decided to go
to public meeting to check it out. At
that meetingRothenberger met past
board member Molly Stieber

“She really helped introduce
me to how SGB works and all that
it does for campus,” Rothenberger
said “I became instantly interested
and was forttmate to be on Alloca-
tions committee and from there my
passion to continue staying involved
grew!) '

Hobbie:

Rothenberger was active in
the music department at her high
school and was a member of show
choir, performed in musicals, and
competed in choir competitions.
The ﬁrst club she joined on campus
was the Women’s Choral Ensemble.

Gordon Louderback

Position: Board Member

Year: Senior

Major: Civil and Environmental En-
gineering ‘

Louderback started getting in-
volved with SGB during his fresh-
man year, through his involvements
with the Pitt Association for Leader-
ship and Success. '

“We worked on different cam-
pus projects which naturally coin-
cided with SGB’s efforts,” he said. “I
worked closely with James Landre-
neau while we were both in PALS”

Best memory with Pitt sports:

“Deﬁnitely the triple overtime
basketball win against WVUV my
freshman year at the

Pete!Therehasbeen alot of great
experiences but that stands out.”

Zoe Samudzi

Position: Board Members

Year: Junior

Major: African Studies, Global
Studies and Political Science

Zoe wasn’t involved in student
government in high school and she
didn’t know much about SGB. dur-
ing her freshman year. But during
her sophomore year, ‘James Lan-
dreneau approached her about run-
ning with him and his slate.

“I’ve learned a lot about nego-
tiating and compromising with
people whose interests and person-
alities differ from mine,” she said.
“That’ll undoubtedly be useﬁil in
the future.”

Weirdest thing ever eaten:

Mopane worms

“It’s not weird, but it’s deﬁnitely
uncommon in America. My family
is Zimbabwean, and in some parts
of southern Africa, people eat mo-
pane worms. They’re a great source
of protein, but deﬁnitely not my fa-

vorite food.” I

of college students, this will be
the first presidential election
in which they can participate.
But this year also features an in-

President Barack Obama will
be the ﬁrst incumbent to be out-
spent in a presidential election
— and you’ll find that fact on the‘
fundraising materials he’s send-
ing out to his supporters. While
Pennsylvania has been consis-
tently blue in recent history, look
for the president’s challenger,
former Republican Massachu-
setts Gov. Mitt Romney, to try
to put PA in play with his sizable
war chest. His «message will be
almost entirely focused on the
economy, and his pitch to" the
American people is that Romney
has the experience and know-
how to create jobs. His pick for
a running mate, Republican Rep.
Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, reinforc-

' es this economy-ﬁrst focus. Ryan

made a name for himself as a ﬁs-
cal conservative who authored
Republican answers to Obama’s
budgets. .

But Obama has stayed con-
sistently above Romney in the
polls, and the president will
portray the former governor as
an out-of-touch, super-wealthy
businessman who’s traded Amer-
ican jobs for qu_ick proﬁts. The
wild card in Pennsylvania will
be the effects of the Republican-
sponsored voter ID law, which
opponents say was a voter— .
suppression effort to keep key
Obama—supporting demograph-
ics away from the polls.

Senate:

Incumbent Democrat Sen.

Bob Casey faces his first re-
election bid after defeating Rick
Santorum in 2006, sending the
social conservative into obscuri-
ty, never to be heard from again.
His challenger, Republican Tom
Smith, faces a huge obstacle in
his bid to unseat Casey —- a lack
of name recognition. Casey was
already well known in the state
when he ran against Santorum,
as his father was a former Penn-
sylvania governor. Until receiv-
ing the Republican nomination,
Smith was only involved in lo-
cal politics, prior to which he
worked in the coal industry. To
win, Smith will have to sell Casey

as Obama’s surrogate, and hope.

the president will be unpopular
enough for the strategy to work.

_House of Representatives:

Hans ‘Lessmann, an eye doc-
tor from the Forest Hills sub-
urb of Pittsburgh, is challenging
Democratic Rep. Mike Doyle, the
incumbent, for the 14th congres-
sional district of Pennsylvania,
which includes Pittsburgh and
a few surrounding boroughs.
But Lessmann has a steep hill
to climb. Doyle holds one of the
safest positions in the country
and has yet to face re-election
bid that has been close. Doyle
won nearly 70 percent of the vote
in 2010, and there isn’t much
reason to think this year will be
any different.

Although Pitt’s campus falls
in the 14th district, another
election of note — in the 12th.
Congressional District — in-
volves a large portion of west-

. ern Pennsylvania. After recent

redistricting, two democratic in-
cumbents, Mark Critz andjason
Altmire, squared off, both seek-
ing re—'election. Critz, the more
conservative of the two, won the
nomination by a small margin
and now leads Keith Rothfus,
whom Altmire defeated in 2010,
in the polls. Critz represents a
very specific brand of local poli-
tician: a social conservative with
strong ties to labor, leading him
to break with his party more of-
ten than other democrats.

Study claims buying and reselling
as opposed to renting textbooks
can save students more monrey

Andrew Shull
News Editor

Behind tuition and room and
board, textbooks are the third
largest expense for college stu-
dents._ But on—campus book-
stores aren’t-the only option
for students seeking required
reading.

Outside of the University
Book Center, there are book
exchanges, online retailers and
textbook rental agencies all
competing for students’ money
in the course-material market.
And while renting might seem
like the best deal, one textbook
comparison website contends
that buying and reselling books
can be a more cost-effective op-
tion than borrowing.

Jeff Sherwood, CEO of text-
book-comparison website Big-
words.com, did a study of the
1,000 most—s_earched textbooks
on his website. Hefound that, in
general, if a book is bought at
the lowest price available and
then sold at the highest sell-back
price offered, the money-saving
results of "the buy/sell method
beat those of renting 95 percent
of the time.

Following that model, Sher-
wood estimates that students
can save, on average, $1,000
annually.

“We’re turning the third—high-
est cost for students to some-
thing that isn’t even that much of
a consideration,” he said.

Sherwood said ‘that finding
students the best deal is his busi-

ness model at Bigwords.com. He

receives a commission when a -

retailer receives a customer from
his website, whether the book
in question is bought, sold or
rented.

“Our job and goal is to show‘

students the cheapest way to get ‘

their textbooks,” he said.

And while buying low and
selling high seems to be most
cost-effective, Sherwood said
that renting can deﬁnitely be
more economical than other
methods. _

He said that the low overhead
associated with online retailers
generally makes them a better
deal than brick-and-mortar re—
tailers, stores that physically

occupy their retail space.

Taking advantage of the li-
brary is another way to save
money. _'

Rush Miller, the executive ad-
ministrator of the University Li-
brary System, said that although
the library can’t help students
circumvent buying textbooks, it
has more than 6.5 million books
available in its collection.

Miller went on to say that

“There have
been a number
of large—scale
efforts to
digitize and
"make available
for free books
that are in
the public
domain.” .
Rush l\/iiller  

the library makes an effort to
be as convenient as possible for
students.

“Everything we can do can be
found on the website,” he said.
“We try to be where you are,
where the students are.”

In addition to requesting
books that are physically in
stock, Miller discussed another
way students can get the refer-
ence materials they’re‘looking
for.

“There have been a number of
large—scale efforts to digitize and
make available for free books
that are in the public’ domain,”
he said.

Of the virtually millions of
books that are free online, Mill-

er pointed to any book whose
copyright has expired —— which
includes books printed before
1923 as well as more recent
books whose copyrights simply
haven’t been renewed.

The public domain refers to
books that are no longer the in-

tellectual property of a person
or a corporation. That means
everybody has the right to view
centuries of primary source ma-
terials that no longer belong to
their authors. .

For classes that require read-
ing old original source docu-
ments — such as literature,
history and philosophy — pub-
lic domain documents allow
students to read original texts
without purchasing countless
paperbacks.

Other documents, -such as
government funded research,
can be viewed for free, as well.

Miller said that the Pitt Li-
brary System has been involved
in this process as well, digitizing
thousands of books, journal ar-
ticles and other documents from
Pitt’s collections. Thosetare then
indexed in a way that allows stu-
dents to both search for and read
these books online.

But Debra Fyock, manager of
the University Book Center, said
that none of these alternatives
can adequately replace the on-
campus book store. '

‘_‘We are the only resource for

"all of the required and recom-

mended coursework for every

class,” she said in an email.

She said that The Book Cen-
ter is conscious of the cost of
textbooks and tries to keep costs
down. The Book Center is the
only store guaranteed to have the
right textbook available.

Fyock went on to say that The
Book Center has options for stu-
dents to rent course materials
as well as buy and sell them,
and offers eBooks in addition
to hard copies. She alsopointed
to the‘store’s return policy and
year-round buy—back offerings
as reasons to keep business on
campus.

Her tip for saving money was
buying and selling at the right
times. She said that selling books
at the beginning ofa semester is
the most cost-effective option,
because this is when The Book
Center has in all of its orders.

“We are very mindful of stu-
dent budgets and endeavor to
have lower prices for new and.
used textbooks when compared

to other brick—and—mortar_

stores,” she said. I

BOMBS  

“The Pitt community across
the board responded to this
threat in an exemplary fashion,”
Hickton said. “We could not have
solved the crime without their
help. The stories of the way the
Pitt community came together
—— from students helping each
other to the tips and ‘assistance
we received — have moved me
deeply.”

Nordenberg said reaching this
point in the investigation was not
only important for the University
and the city, but also for society
at large, which continues to see
an increasing number of cyber
attacks. -

Gary Douglas Perdue, special
agent in charge of the Pittsburgh
division of the FBI, agreed with
Nordenberg on the increasing
seriousness of cyber attacks.

“Criminal activity, facilitat-
ed through the use of computer
technology, is an increasing
problem for law enforcement,”
he said. “The FBI is committed
to meet this challenge.”

He said the Bureau is expand-
ing its cyber capabilities to keep
up with this channel of crime.

In recent months, law en-
forcement officials said much
of the difficulty in tracking the
perpetrator was due to his use
of sophisticated anonymizing
servers that obscured the loca-
tion from which the threats were
emailed.

During the press conference,
Nordenberg also addressed the
University’s decision to rescind
the $50,000 reward for infor-
mation about the threatener in
return for an end to the threats.

“Whenever there was a'dif—
ﬁcult decision to be made, I lis-

tened attentively and respectfully .

to the advice of law enforcement
officials and my own senior
staff,” Nordenberg said. “But in

. the end, the decision was mine

to make.”

He said that a first offer to
end the bomb threats in return
for removal of the reward, sent
on April 10, was crudely crafted
and included factual errors and

was therefore not taken seriously.
However, a similar email offer -
_on April 20, this time promising a

24-hour reprieve in bomb threats

' to prove the author of the email

was in fact the threatener, led

Nordenberg to make the decision .

to remove the reward.

“It’s a threshold question of
whether you ever respond to
threatening messages of this

type,” Nordenberg said.

Police chief says investigation
continues

Pitt Police Chief Tim Delaney
said that despite Busby’s indict-
ment, the bomb threats investi-
gation is not yet closed.

“There are other elements
here,” Delaney said, citing Bus-
by’s current status in a foreign
country as one such element.
“All the questions have not been
answered.” '

During the press conference,
Nordenberg and Hickton gave
special thanks to the‘ Pitt police
for their efforts in responding to
the formerly daily bomb threats.

Delaney said that the bomb
threats “stretched [the police
force] to the max,” but that the

continued support from other

law enforcement agencies, in-
cluding city police and the FBI,
along with thoughts of keeping
the Pitt community safe kept a
tired police force motivated.

“The kids were always our
main interest,” Delaney said. “I
have 28,000 kids. They’re my
children and I need to be respon-
sible for them.”

Delaney said he was especially ,

impressed with the way the Pitt,
community came together in re—
sponse to the bomb threats.
“The more they threatened us,
the more people got involved,”
Delaney said. “We had one com-
mon enemy -— all of us ——‘It

V doesn’t happen that often.”

YouTube threateners indicted

In addition to announcing the
Busby indictment, Hickton also
announced the indictment of two
Ohio menin aseparate threat
made against Pitt via YouTube
in April. A .

Alexander Waterland of Love-
land, Ohio, and Brett Hudson, of
Hillsboro,.Ohio, are both charged
with engaging in a conspiracy
targeting the" computer system
of the University. _ .

A group using the YouTube
username AnonOperative13
claimed in a YouTube video
posted on April 26 to'have hacked
into Pitt’s computer system and
downloaded personal informa-
tion about Pitt students, employ-
ees and alumni. '

Hickton said that both Wa-
terland and Hudson will be ar-
raigned in federal court in Pitts-
burgh later this month. The law
prescribes a maximumsentence

xgf five years in prison, a fine of
$250,000 or both ifthe two men

are found guilty. I

DIETRICH

Pitt has yet to receive any payout
from the $125 million donation be-
queathed to the University by Wil-
liam S. Dietrich II last September, but
plans are already well underway for
how the funds will be managed once
they have been received.

Although Dietrich’s donation be-
came operational upon his death in
October 2011, ﬁmds from the endow-
ment might not arrive at Pitt until
early next year. But both ﬁnancial
representatives of Dietrich’s estate
and Pitt ofﬁcials say that the lag in
fund dispersalis to be expectedwith
such a sizable contribution. ’

Last fall, the late Pitt alumnus set
the record for the largest monetary
donation in Pitt’s history when he
armounced his gift on Sept. 22. The
contribution came shortly after
Dietrich’s announcement of a $225
million donation to Carnegie Mel-
lon University, and both institutions
quickly renamed their largest col-
leges in honor of the donor’s parents
—- Pitt christening the Kenneth L.
Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences,
and CMU armouncing the Marianna
Brown Dietrich College of Humani-
ties and Social Sciences. However,
neither university has received any
actual money. ‘

N.]ohn Cooper, dean of the Diet-
rich School of Arts & Sciences, said
the delay isn’t cause for concern.

“Any estate on this sort of scale
takes some time to setup, and the ap-
propriate foundationforthatprocess
is not yet complete,” he said.

CMU spokeswoman Teresa
Thomas said in an email that the
delay in payout from the operation-
al funds also falls in line with he
school’s expectations. *

Edward J. Grefenstette, chief
investment ofﬁcer of the Dietrich
Charitable Trusts, said in an email
that while the vehicle forcharitable
fund dispersal —— The Dietrich Foun-
dation — is currently formed, it has
yetto beftmded. He said thatthere is,

however, a timetable in place for the
completion of the funding process.
“There are certain regulatory, tax
and ‘administrative requirements
that must be satisﬁed before the Di-
etrich Charitable Trusts can fund The
Dietrich Foundation,” Grefenstette
said. “We are hopefulthat the founda-
tion’s funding can take place around
year-end, meaning that the ﬁrst of the
annual distributions to the founda-
tion’s supported organizations will
likely begin in the ﬁrst half of 2013.”
Pitt and CMU will receive the
funds from the Dietrich Charitable
Trusts, which was created from as-
sets generated by the sale of Dietrich
Industries in 1996 andwillﬁ.1ndThe

Dietrich Foundation.

“It is expected that, in aggregate,
approximately 3 percent of the foun-
dation’s total assets will be distribut-
ed annually,” Grefenstette said. “The
University of Pittsburgh is expected
to receive 25 percent of the amount
of each annual distribution made by
the foundation.”

As University ofﬁcials await pay-
out from the largest gift in Pitt his-
tory, they face state and University
regulations for the use of ﬁmds as en-
dowed gifts. The amount of endow-
ment “income” available for spend-
ing is determined by the Investment
Committee of Pitt’s Board ofTrustees
and is governed by Pennsylvania law.

’ According. to the University’s
Endowed Fund Reports, which are
published online, the University of
Pittsburgh Endowment Fund, which
consists of nearly 2,000 individual
funds and has market value in excess
of $2.5 billion as ofjune 30, 2011,
is comprised of endowed  that
provide ﬁnancial support for schol-
arships, fellowships, faculty chairs,
instruction and other important
University programs and services.

By deﬁnition, an endowed  is
intended to provide the University
with a permanent source of funding
by investing the principal amount of
the gift and making available a por-
tion of the income it generates for
use by the University.

Thomas said that Dietrich’s gift A

increases CMU°s endowment in‘ a

. waythatwillsupportfuture academic

initiatives across the university, in-
cluding undergraduate and graduate

‘ programs, scholarship, artistic cre-

ation and research, but that it should
be noted that the CMU endowment
will not immediately increase by the
amount of Dietrich’s donation.

“Rather, the Dietrich Foundation

will oversee the Dietrich gift and
will make annual distributions to
the CMU endowment in perpetuity,
which will increase the CMU endow-
ment over time,” she said.

While a timeline for the reception
of the money remains unclear, Pitt
intends to move forward with plans
for the donation. Cooper noted that
under the terms of the gift, the money
will be used to create endowments
to support activities in the Dietrich
school, at least for the ﬁrst few years
of its dispersal. _

Cooper said hewillpresentaplan
over the next year to the provost for
the use of the funds to be distributed
to Pitt, and that the plan will focus
on three key areas: undergraduate
scholarships, endowed chairs and
graduate fellowships.

“Using the ﬁmds in this way is an
investment in excellence,” Cooper

New West Oakland community

center provides social hub

Pat McAteer
Stcyf Wrz'ter

At Friendship Community Presby-

terian Church, the idea of build-
ing a community center in its West
Oakland neighborhood arose af-
ter members of the congregation
recognized a need for community
outreach in a largely forgotten sec-
tor of Pittsburgh.

After three years of planning,
the church opened its new com-
munity center, The Corner, on
Robinson Street last spring. Those
involved with the creation of The
Comer say it will beneﬁt Pitt stu-
dents and West Oakland residents
alike by providing services that ﬁt
individual needs.

Pitt English Professor Mark
Kramer, a member of Friendship
Community Church and one of the
leaders in the push to create The
Corner, said the new venue tailors
its programs to members of the

- community.-

‘‘—The idea here is to engage
people socially and at a level to ﬁt
their own personal needs,” Kramer
said. “We wanted to have a place to
express concerns and make plans
for organizing activities.”

For Kramer, the opening of The
Corner is a tribute to the hard-
working members of Friendship
Community Church.

.According to Kramer, the
planning process began afterthe
church hired a consulting ﬁrm and
surveyed more than 50 people in
the area, including local residents
and representatives from institu-
tions such as Pitt, Carnegie Mel-
lon, Carlow and UPMC. The sur-

vey gauged the interest level of the .

community in issues affecting area

— residents.

When church organizers re-
ceived the results of the survey,
Kramer said they decided on a
variety of needs to focus on in the
neighborhood, including after-
school programs for local high
school students and j ob skills train-
ing programs.

Since opening its doors, The
Corner has served as a site for
neighborhood council meetings,
as well as a provider of services for
area residents.

Kramer said The Corner pro—‘

vides the opportunity for Pitt stu-

dents, members of the Friendship ‘

congregation and local residents to
interact -— especially during the
renovation of the property.
Rahuljoyce, a junioraccounting
major at Pitt, said in an email that

  

his experience painting and clean-
ing The Corner before its opening
allowed him to meet West Oakland
residents and form friendships
with other Pitt students.

“It was very fulﬁlling to know

. that the local community will be

able to enjoy an environment that
-I had a part in helping clean up,”
Joyce said. A

Joyce’s involvement in the proj-
ect began after taking Kramer’s
Seminar in Composition class dur-
ing his freshman year. The class
focused on community service, a
subject he is passionate about.

“It was wonderful to meet and

- make new friends from‘ Pitt and

with residents around West Oak-
land who had very similar inter-

‘CRIME.

but if infractions are minor and
infrequent, the response from
the University should be to pre-
scribe counseling and to examine
the underlying reasons — such
as family or ﬁnancial problems
— for students’ behavior.

Discussing the University’s.

policy for offenses that occur off
campus and for which students
already face legalconsequences,
Molly McKain, a senior major-
ing in chemical engineering, ex-

pressed skepticism. .
“I would say that if the gov-
ernment has already prosecuted

[the offending student] to the

fullest extent of the law, then

I don’t see why the University ‘

needs to step in and punish'[him
or her] again,” McKain said.

While McKain stressed that
she could see the reason the Uni-
versity would discipline students
who commit violent offenses or
those caught with illegal drugs,
she speculated that there were
few such offenders on campus.
Most Pitt students, she believes,
do nothing more serious than
drink underage.

Similarly, Fedele stressed that
Pitt has not witnessed many cas-
es for which it has needed to pun-
ish students during the holidays
and breaks. ' ‘

“Students who have matricu-
lated at the University are subject
to the code,” he said. “[_]udi'cial
Board] ﬁlings while on summer"
or holiday break are somewhat
uncommon, but can and do oc-
cur.” ’ i

Hopefully, though, students
will be too busy to find them-
selves in trouble.

“I probably wouldn’t have
time to get arrested even if I
tried,” McKain said. I

Fresh, organic food at heartof   at farmer’s market 2

Pennsylvania and Ohio. In a single week, the ’

Em Maier
Stcyf Wrz'ter

Seven years ago, a Southern California couple
left suburbia and bought a farm in Ohio. The
husband didn’t come from an agricultural
background — he hadn’t been raised on eggs
from the henhouse or milk from the pasture.

Jeff Mott, 45, and his wife, Shelley, began
a new type of farm business, one built on a
manageable scale. This enabled their fam-
ily to utilize and appreciate the farm while
remaining capable of traveling and relaxing
during the short off-season, which lasts from-
November to February. And their contempo-
rary agrarian venture is not an uncommon
one; dedicated small—scale food growers keep
farmers markets well—stocked from Seattle
to Pittsburgh, offering fresh produceto ur-
banites for the majority of the year.

The Mott family began its business by
planting a wide variety of greens, from the
commonplace sugar snap pea and Swiss
chard to the more unusual eight-ball zuc-
chini and dandelion greens.Jeff Mott focused
on the concept of permaculture, a type of
ecological engineering based on developing
sustainable farms and settlements modeled
after natural ecosystems. The orchard on his
land is a mix of fruit trees and berry bushes

« designed to attract a variety of pollinators.

As the farm grew in production, its dis-

tribution network grew to include both

Mott family now attends numerous markets,
delivering their fresh, organic, local produce
to consumers and restaurants alike.

Intrigued by the plurality of culinary op- A

tions presented by food growing, the Motts
eventually began to vary their selection by
adding more exotic Asian plants, inﬂuenced

by Shelley’s background —— her family had ‘

sold vegetables in Chicago. The two now
hawk Italian, heirloom and Asianvegetables
and encourage clients to explore and try
new ﬂavors.

“I want to do as much local as possible.
We have an ethnic niche, and it’s what I love,’’
said Jeff Mott, who has attended the local
Pittsburgh markets for the past three years.

The transaction between farmer and
eater extends past the kitchen table in the

‘case of Jen Lea, 23, one of Mott’s regular

clients. A graduate student at Pitt’s School
of Public Health, Lea began helping out on
Wednesdays at the Motts’ stand at Phipps
Conservatory. There, she converses with the
patrons and points out interesting facts and
uses for the wide variety of products laid out
on the table. ’
“I much prefer farmers markets and local
food. The taste of the lettuces — it’s one of

those things that you almost have to taste to _

believe it, but it’s such a difference,” Lea said.
“The ﬂavors are phenomenal — cooking
what’s in season, it’s very natur .”

Lea said she is one of many who have be-

come taken with the concept of “Slow Food,” .

a movement started in Italy in 1986 that
promotes a fresh, clean, wholesome attitude
toward agriculture, according to Slow Food
International’s web page. Slow Food puts a
focus on eating seasonally, primarily through
small-scale producers with moderate prices.

A Lea took the theory to heart, buying sea-
sonal produce, tweaking favorite recipes to
include her new purchases or freezing others
to last throughout the winter-.

As indicated by Jeff Mott and Lea, not.

all agrarians are from an agricultural back-
ground. Farmers market vendors such as the
Clarion River Organic, a _co—op from Sligo,
Pa., -often build lasting relationships with;
their buyers, whose interest grows intoa
greater involvement with farming. Such

‘ stands will offer “shares” to interested con-

sumers, allowing families to receive a weekly

. portion of farm goods that typically contains

an assortment of recently harvested produce.

Aubrey and Justin Hillman are two such
people. _

“We really appreciate the local produce,
which we get here and at the community
gardens,” Justin Hillman, 29, said. ’

And the tradeoff allows farmers and’ur—
banites to enter a. symbiotic relationship,
as the farmers receive payment early in the
season and the consumers receive fresh food,
as well as an education about the qualities

and ﬂavors of what they’re ingesting.

“For us, it’s the community aspect, sup-
porting the local farms. Personally, I like to
know where it’s coming from. I can talk to the
farmers, ﬁnd out what has been happening
lately,” Aubrey Hillman agreed. _

Justin Hillman had not been raised on
local produce. While his wife had grown
up working on an orchard, he experienced
something new upon trying fresh fruits and
vegetables and said he noticed a remarkable
difference. The couple has made plans to

become farmers themselves, but for now’

they are simplymaintaining a small garden
and studying the practicesand economics
of farming.

Mark Haines, 23, of West Michigan,
joined the network only a_ few short weeks
ago on the advice of some friends. Acting as
a porter for Clarion River Organics, which
includes numerous Amish farms, he grew
more involved with the ideology of his cli-

' ents. Despite his short time working with

the co—op, he’s become mindful of what he
ingests daily.

~ “I began eating more heal-thily, staying
away from processed foods and the like. At
some point, you -really want to know what’s
in your food — and for that, you need to get
to the source. There may be things you don’t

Recent legislation requires photo identiﬁcation at polls
2 Student ID and drivers licmseﬁtllﬁl requirements  

Pat McAteer ~
Stqff Wrz’ter

While the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation estimates around 750,000
statewide voters lack a valid form of identi-
ﬁcation, Pitt officials say ID cards issued by
the University are considered valid under the

' state’s new voter ID law.

Although opponents of the voter ID law
are concerned it would disenfranchise eli-
gible voters who do not have an appropri-
ate form of identiﬁcation, Pitt students with
University ID cards should have no problem
voting in the No_ver'nber presidential election.
Pitt spokesman Robert Hill said in an email
that because University ID ‘cards include ex—
piration dates, the state considers them a
valid form of ID.

The Pennsylvania law requires that voters
present a valid form of photographic identi-
ﬁcation every time they enter their polling
location. In addition, the identiﬁcation card
— issued by a government agency, a state
university or one of the commonwealth’s
nursing homes — must be have avisible ex-
piration date. . .

Critics of the law, including Democrats,
have accused state Republicans of attempt-
ing to suppress the vote of elderly citizens,

   

 

minorities, disabled people and the low in-
come bracket of the electorate that typically
vote Democrat by limiting accessibility to
valid forms of identiﬁcation. Proponents of
the law said that it’s necessary in order to
prevent voter fraud.

In recent days, this ideological battle over
Voter,ID has fallen into the courtroom. This
month, Pennsyvaniajudge Robert Simpson
upheld the Commonwealth’s right to require
voter ID at polls.

. “Petitioners did not establish . . . that dis-
enfranchisement was immediate or inevi-
table,” Simpson wrote in his 70—page Opinion.

The case will likely be appealed to the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court by Voter ID’s
opponents in coming days.

Pitt’s Director of Commonwealth Rela-
tions Charles McLaughlin said the University
has a policy of not providing a public stance
on state government issues. . ,

“Generally, on issues that are this conten-
tious, the University does not take a stance,”
McLaughlin said.

Outside of Pitt’s campus, the newly-en-
acted law has received widespread criticism
from Pennsylvania’s Democratic party as well
as numerous other national and state orga-
nizations. -

eny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, said

Pennsylvania’s state constitution lists being
18 years of age and living in Pennsylvania and
the U.S. for a month as the only criteria for
an eligible voter. She said Republicans didn’t
attempt to amend the state’s constitution to .
account for the law’s lack of constitutionality.

Fitzgerald ‘was a co-signer of a lawsuit
against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
related to the voter ID law.

Downs also said the new voter ID law,
could prevent 100,000 Allegheny County
residents from voting in the November presi-
dential election. - ‘ '

Critics of the law and statistics from the
Department of State have raised concerns
about whether eligible voters will be able to
obtain valid identiﬁcation before the election.

Ana Gonzalez, a Philadelphia resident
who was born in Puerto Rico and currently /
lacks a valid form of identiﬁcation, said the
new law could prevent her from voting for
the ﬁrst time since gaining eligibility.

“I don’t have a birth certiﬁcate and, right
now, I’m trying to get my birth certiﬁcate and
I was told I needed a photo ID to try to get
a birth certiﬁcate, so that’s the situation my
family’s struggling with and that’s why I felt
Ineed to get in contact with the ACLU and
see if there’s some way they could help me
and try to take a stand against this issue,”
Gonzalez said.

With the backing of voters like Gonzalez,
organizations from around the nation have
publicly opposed the law and dedicated re-
sources to defeat it through the state’s court
system. ‘

New York University’s Brennan Center for

Justice, one of the law’s most vocal national
opponents, offered its expert assistance in
Applewhite v. Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania, the case in which Simpson upheld the
Voter ID Law. . -

The ACLU and Advancement Project are
two of multiple organizations providing legal
assistance in the ongoing battle over voter ID
in Pennsylvania.

Wendy Weiser, Director of the Brennan
Center’s Democracy Program, said Rep. Mike
Turzai, R-Allegheny, Pennsylvania’s House
majority leader, revealed the true intentions
of the law at a Republican State Committee
meeting earlier this year. Turzai said the new
law gave presumptive Republican presiden-
tial nominee Mitt Romney an edge in the
state. - -

Rainbow Alliance, Sodexo comment on campus Chick-fil-A

Andrew Shull
News Editor

Tricia Dougherty hasn’t eaten at Chick-
ﬁl-A in about two years.
The president of Pitt’s Rainbow Alli-

' ance, an LGBTQ advocacy group on cam-

pus, cut the restaurant out of her campus
dining options ever since she heard the
fast food chain was donating money to
organizations that oppose same-sex mar-
riage. 2

The controversy surrounding Chick-
ﬁl—A experienced a spike in public aware-
ness recently after the Biblical Recorder, a
weekly Baptist newspaper based in North
Carolina, asked restaurant CEO Dan Cathy
if he opposed same-sex marriage. He re-
sponded in the July 16 interview that he
was “guilty as charged.”

His declaration opened up an outpour-
ing of objections and support around the
country. The controversy hits close to
home, as Pitt’s campus includes a Chick-
ﬁl—A restaurant on the ground floor of the
Cathedral of Learning.

In an email, University spokesman

_ John Harvith deferred comment on Pitt’s

stance on the issue, insteadproviding
statements from Chick—fil-A and Sodexo,
the corporation that oversees Pitt’s cam-

pus dining.
The statement from Sodexo didn’t di-

rectly comment on same-sex marriage, .

but it advised customers to vote with
their money. 2

“While we provide a variety of op-
tions, ultimately our customers decide
for themselves which businesses they
wish to support with their Dining Dol-
lars,” the statement said.

The statements from both Sodexo and
Chick-ﬁl-A maintained that the organiza-
tions respect diversity and do not dis-
criminate when it comes to their clients.

And while Chick-fil-A reaffirmed its
commitment to '“biblically-based prin-
ciples,” which include charitable dona-
tions and closing on Sundays, it chose
to eschew further commentary on the
hot—button issue. .

“Going forward, our intent is to leave

the policy debate over same-sex marriage '

to the government and political arena,”
Chick-ﬁl-A’s statement said.

For Dougherty, Cathy’s comments
didn’t come as a surprise. The Rainbow
Alliance’s opposition to Chick-ﬁl-A is
nothing new. »

Dougherty said that two years ago, the
group organized a boycott of Chick-ﬁl-A
because the company donated money

“[Chick-fil-A] i
can say anything
they want and do
what they want,
but it’s important
that people

know where their

money is going.”

Tricia Dougherty

to organizations that oppose marriage
equality. '

- However, she said the continued
presence of the restaurant on campus
wouldn’t be a priority for her organiza-
tion, regardless of the recent controversy.

Dougherty said she would bring the
issue before the board of the Rainbow
Alliance to ask members if anyone would
want to tackle the issue, most likely

through attempts to inform the student -

‘ body about Chick-fil—A’s stance. .

“When we did the first protest, people
had no idea,” Dougherty said.

While she did characterize Chick—f1l—A
as a “hateful organization” and described
its presence on campus as “unfortunate,”
Dougherty didn’t go os far as to say that
members of the Pitt community should
boycott the restaurant. ’

“I won’t say that anyone should or
shouldn’t eat there,” she said.

The controversy has garnered nation-
wide attention. The mayor of Boston,
Thomas Menino, and the mayor of Chi-
cago, Rahm Emanuel — both democrats
— voiced their opposition to Chick-fil-A
restaurants within their cities’ limits, al-
though neither found means of enforcing
the sentiment. ‘

Other prominent public figures, in-
cluding former presidential candidate
Mike Huckabee and the Rev. Billy G.ra-
ham, came out in support of the restau-
rant.

For Dougherty, helping consumers
know what types of organizations their
money supports remainsthe most im-
portant thing. ‘

“[Chick-fil-A] can say anything they
want and do what they want,” she said,
“but it’s important that people know
where their money is going.” I

New system provides students
option to pay to electronically
order copies of transcript

Joe Chilson
Staff Wrz'ter

Pitt instituted a new system for ordering
transcripts this summer, which will abolish
the long lines at Thackeray Hall. But the new

__ convenience comes with a price.

Pitt’s new system for ordering tran-
scripts, initiated on June 5, will be faster,

more convenient and will offer transcripts '

in PDF form. But, for the ﬁrst time since
2005, the process will cost students money.

The old method of obtaining transcripts
required students to go to Thackeray Hall
and request a physical copy that could also
be mailed to a speciﬁed location.

Under the old system, many graduating
students began to ﬁnd that employers and
graduate schools were requesting electronic
transcripts, which Pitt did not provide, ac-
cording to Carol Miller, the supervisor of
transcripts and cer-
tiﬁcations. She said
the Registrar’s Office
was inundated with
requests to make the

about it, and we T

for free by going to Thackeray Hall, but the
Registrar’s Office will no longer mail them.

The Avow system also offers a tracking
service. For an extra $1.99, students can see
when their mailed transcript has arrived and
when their electronic transcript was opened.

Miller said the new system is also faster.
With Avow, a mailed transcript will usually
arrive in 1-2 business days instead of the
average 3-5 under the old system. Electronic
transcripts-will usually arrive in just a few
hours. .

The online. system also gives students
the option to add an attachment to their

5 electronic transcript, such as a resumé, a

cover letter or test scores.
“We’re excited about it, and we think

i students will be excited about it,” Miller

said of the new system. “We’re keeping up

_ with the times.”

But some students are uneasy about

having to pay for a '

service which was
. previously free.

The new system will allow students to

trar’s Office website for former students. An

_ Travis Wisor,-

hard to keep student costs down. A
“We feel like this is a reasonable price,”

. Wisor said.

And when compared with other universi-
ties, it is. Temple University charges $8.25
for similar services and Penn State charges
$9. . .

Wisor said many at the Registrar’s Ofﬁce
feel that the price is a small one to pay for the
step forward in convenience and ﬂexibility.

“Our office is still available,” Wisor said.
“This is just an extension of the services that
our office already offers.”

campaign by the University to raise funding
outside of tuition and public funds, past the
$1.85 billion mark, moving it closer to its $2
billion goal. .

Cooper said that the campaign, which dis-
perses funds for use by faculty and in schol-
arships and fellowships, has been extremely
successﬁil and is by far the largest capital cam-
paign among public universities in western
Pennsylvania’s history.

“The chancellor was strongly in the view
that voluntary supports were really the key to
providing ﬁnancial strength to the University,”

. Cooper said. “So with the aim to strengthen the

University, without being completely depen-
dent on public aid and undergraduate tuition,
we made the launch of the capital campaign.”

 

     
    
  
  
  
    
 

The Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences
provides instruction in the natural sciences
and humanities and includes more than 10,000
undergraduate students pursuing majors or
certiﬁcates in the nearly 50 departments and
programs. The school also offers the largest
graduate program in Pittsburgh and includes
Pitt’s College of General Studies, which is one
of the region’s leading providers of adult educa-
tion programs.

Grefenstette said that, in time, Dietrich’s
donations could have far—reaching impacts.

“Because of the perpetual nature of the
gift, it certainly has the power, over time, to
be transformative for the foundation’s sup-
ported organizations, as well as for the city
of Pittsburgh, in which almost all of them are
situated,” he said. ~ ' _

Cooper said that individual donations like
Dietrich’s impact Pitt’s future success and ac-
cessibility in important ways.

“The creation of endowments of this sort are
really going to be the key to growing the excel-
lence of our university and-also in maintaining
access to the University for undergraduate stu-
dents in a time when tuition is such a ﬁnancial
burden on so many of our students,” he said.

than half a million followers in the U.S.
and about 25 million worldwide, making
it the world’s ﬁfth-largest religion.

As the audience continued to listen
intently, Sucha Singh emphasized that
focus on God, honest livelihood and shar-
ing within one’s community are central to
Sikhs’ faith. He also cited scripture that
counsels believers not to seek’ retaliation
against enemies. '

After Sucha Singh’s address, two other
members of the sangat also shared their
thoughts on the tragedy.

Sangat member Bani Kaurdiscussed
Sikh-Americans’ contributions to the na-
tion, pointing out to that the ﬁrst doctor
to arrive at the‘World Trade Center fol-
lowing the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, was a

- Sikh—American.

Amar Singh, another member of the
sangat, spoke "after Kaur. His remarks fo-
cused on the turban, the headwear Sikhs
don as an outward sign of faith. He point-
ed out that the turban emerged as a sign

-of equality during a period of Indian his-

tory when castes dictated citizens’ social
positions. Despite the events at Oak Creek
and other violence directed at Sikhs in the
United States and around the world, for
Singh, his turban is linked inextricably to
his identity. '

“While the turban may make us the
targets of these senseless attacks,” Singh
said, “I have never been prouder in my life
to tie the turban.” ' .

“The unsaid sentence was that for the
ﬁrst time in many years, there will be a level
playing ﬁeld in Pennsylvania because of voter
ID and other election reforms put in place,”
Miskin said. “The fact is, there is and has been
election fraud in Pennsylvania regardless of
Democrat and ACLU naysayers.”

Many of Turzai’s Democratic counter-
parts, however, disagreed with Miskin’s
clariﬁcation, saying the law poorly deﬁnes
what’s considered a valid form of identiﬁca-
tion, thereby putting voters’ rights in danger.

_ Sen.Jay Costa, D—Allegheny, whose legisla-
tive district encompasses Pitt’s campus, said
in an email that the law was “ill—conceived
[and] short—sighted” and could affect many
voters — including students.

“This will hit students hard — especially

Weiser said Turzai’s admission invalidated
the Republicans’ argument that the law was
enacted to combat possible problems of in-
person voting fraud.

“In fact, as we all heard, the House Ma-
jority Leader had said that it, in fact, was
the reason that the law was passed was in
order to deliver Mitt Romney as president,”
Weiser said.

Steve Miskin, Turzai’s press secretary,
said reports “misrepresented and mischar-
acterized” the state representative’s remarks.

“Seniors, the less—afﬂuent, minorities and
others without driver’s..licenses or other
forms of identiﬁcation will also face obstacles
and may not participate in the election.”

But in a statement released on Aug. 15,
Turzai once again defended his position on
the issue.

“The many election reforms enacted, in-
cludng voter ID, are aimed to ensure citizens
and registered voters have the right to vote

and have their vote counted. It’s about one '

" with a group of people united to make a dif-

ference.”

Whilejoyce said that he would like to even-
tually attend a program at The Corner during
the fall semester, other Pitt students have
made the project a part of their studies at Pitt.

Whitney Bosnyak, a student in Pitt’s Grad-
uate School of Social Work, said in an email
thatshe became involved with The Corner
through the school’s second-year program
placement. K

She said The Corner offers a variety of
summer programs such as Saturday mar-'
kets, an open microphone night, nutrition

“It is great to work

classes, a home—buying workshop and free
health screenings. V

Bosnynak emphasized that the Saturday
morning markets, which take place outside
of the community center, have been received
positvely by members of the community.
During the weekly event, artists and local
food vendors sell their products to shoppers
from West Oakland and beyond.

Like Kramer, Bosnyak said The Corner is a
community— driven project, and its programs
reﬂect the needs of West Oakland residents.

I For her, this aspect of The Corner promises a

positive output from the community center
heading into the future.

“In my opinion, the role of a community
center in an ‘area as diverse as West Oak-

, land and Oak Hill is a really important one,”

Bosnyak said. “I think the more that people
can get to know one another and build rela-
tionships, the better neighbors they will be,
and there will be a greater understanding of
various life situations and circumstances.”

_ gear. The group quickly discovered that each

star on the American ﬂag corresponds to a dif-
ferent state. By following patterns indicated
in the clues they previously discovered, the
stars on the ﬂag revealed a series of numbers
—- GPS codes.

“That epiphany really set us off,” Buchman
said. “We had it all ﬁgured out by Sunday.”

But the gang couldn’t leave immediately
because of work commitments, and Buchman
couldn’t go at all because she was out of sick
days. So after going to work on Monday, and
worried they might be beaten to the punch,
Stough, Zaczek and Aizpitarte jumped in the

car at 8 p.m. and headed for La Moille, 111. A
Following a ten-hour drive from.Pitts-
burgh, they arrived at the source of their GPS

‘ coordinates — afarmer’s ﬁeld in La Moille, Ill.

This was the moment. After months of
solving clues, they were going to ﬁnd the sil-
ver turtle. But there were no markings in the
ﬁeld. No signpost saying ‘Treasure Here.’ Not
even a scarecrow. The owner of the ﬁeld didn’t
know anything about a treasure hunt, either.

“He told us if we were looking for a silver
turtle, his kids had found some turtles. They
could paint them silver and give them to us,”
Zaczek said.

Zaczek and Stough traipsed out into the
ﬁeld searching for some hint of where their
treasure might be, but after searching for
some time and coming up empty, the team

had to face the facts — they arrived at the
wrong location.

In their frustration, but not quite ready
to give up yet, the team found a football ﬁeld
in the middle of rural Illinois and laid down
on it. Zaczek and Stough. pored over all the
clues again, while Aizpitarte laid on her back,
thinking. After some time in these positions,

' Aizpitarte bolted up in revelation.

“What if it’s in the wrong format?” she

_ asked.

Stough explained later that the problem
with using GPS is there are different formats
—- a decimal number, degree—minutes—sec—
onds or degree—minutes -— which can de-

_ scribe different locations.

They ran the coordinates in a new degrees-
minutes-seconds-based format instead of

the decimal format they previously used and
found that the new coordinates led them to
a state park about an hour away in Dixon, Ill.

“[While] driving, we ﬁgured out it was on
the Ronald Reagan Trail,” Zaczek said.

“That was a tip—of_f,” Stough said/. “That
he would hide it in some conservative place.”

Colbert’s character on his television show
parodies conservative commentators, most
notably Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly, and Colbert
makes frequent references to his devotion to
former President Reagan.

Once in the park, though, the team couldn’t
ﬁnd the treasure. They weren’t sure of the
exact point in the 50—acre park where the
treasure was hidden.

They spent two hours inspecting a tele-
phone pole in the middle of the park, thinking
the treasure must be hidden inside. Eventu-

' ally, they moved on to a bathhouse where

Reagan worked as a young man. Outside the
bathhouse was a memorial to Reagan. Aiz-
pitarte ‘— despite a mortal fear of spiders ——

' pulled stones off the side of the monument,

believing the turtle could be inside.

“That was our Indiana Jones moment,”
Stough added.

But the turtle wasn’t in the monument."
The gang continued.to search.

“We get to the edge of this trail, and we
start kind of fanning out, and after only a
minute I see this strange-looking log on the
trail. It was really clean,” Stoughsaid.

“And it had cut edges, too,” Aizpitarte said.
“I don’t think anything else in that forest had
cut edges.”

Stough kicked the log. It landed right—side
up and he noticed it had a strange sectioned
bottom. _

“I looked at Zaczek and said, ‘What is
this?”’

Zaczek picked up the strange log, and, not
realizing his own strength, ripped the back
part off. Only then did they notice a mark-
ing that said ‘D0n’t_break me open...” with a
warning lost to the elements. '

The other side of the log said, “If you want
to win the prize, Kingmaker, take heed.”

_ “We were excited at that point, but we
couldn’t even celebrate, we were just staring
at each other in shock,” Stough said.

Inside they found a small turtle, a scroll
congratulating them and an email address to
let “The Colbert Report” know they’d found

V the prize.

Zaczek and Stough went back to the car to
tell Aizpitarte, who was napping, about their
discovery, and they would call Buchman later.

“We knocked on the car door and said

‘Aizpitarte, we have a really important clue,”’

Stough said. Too exhausted to solve any more

_ clues for the day, Aizpitarte told her friends

to go away-. , _

The guys eventually got Aizpitarte out of
the car, and, in one hand, Z_aczek held the
treasure before his" fellow hunter. Aizpitarte
looked at the box with wide eyes.

“No way,” she said. '

Looking back on the trip, Stough isn’t sure
what to make of the adventure. *

“It’s kind of funny because a lot of thestuff
we had to ﬁgure out by accident or by Provi-
dence, whatever way you want to interpret
it,” Stough said. I I — — ..

audience, pledging support to the Sikh
community and praising its restraint. He
called the actions of Wade Michael Page,
the alleged shooter, “an attack on our
core principles.” He went on to pledge
that law enforcement will be committed
to protecting the Sikh community.

“Such attacks are unacceptable and
will never be tolerated,” Hickton said.

Other government officials also at-
tended the ceremony to offer condolenc-
es and support to the Sikh community.

U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy offered his sym-
pathies and added that he had seen cause

for hope at the service, where so many

expressed solidarity with the Sikh com-_

munity. . -

“We are not a nation of hate,” Murphy
said. “We are a nation of love, and as such,
there is no room for hate in this room.”

James Kennedy and Jeffrey Schaffer
took the stage on behalf of Gov. Tom Cor-
bett and U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle respective-
ly, also extending condolences.

Tharren Thompson, who teaches reli-
gious studies at Penn State, told the au-
dience about his longstanding relation-
ship with the Pittsburgh Sikh Gurdwara,
where he often brings his students.

“The fact that‘I am a‘Christian does
not prevent being welcomed here,” he
said. '

Thompson went on to say that mem-
bers of all faiths were rallying around
Sikhs to offer support._

Following the service, those in atten-
dance slowly ﬁled out of the sanctuary,
each taking a small serving of Karah Par-
shad, a sweet, traditional pudding that
symbolizes their acceptance of the teach-
ings of their religion’s founders.

At the doorway that led to the parking
lot, sangat members handed a candle to
each person who ﬁled past. Most of those

leaving the temple paused to replace _

their shoes, which all those present had
removed previously as a sign of respect
before entering the sanctuary.

Candle light illuminating each of their
faces in the dark, the attendees gathered

around the Nishan Sahib, a tall, saffron-
colored ﬂag symbolising Sikh identity,
whose post was mounted beside the
gurdwara’s parking lot.

After a priest and gurdwara leaders
said the name of each of the six victims,
the rest of those present responded, “Wa-
heguru,” a Sikh name for God, in unison.
Following the mention of those slain, the
name of Lt. Brian Murphy was also re-
cited.

After all of the names had been read,
the worshippers and attendees patiently
awaited their turns to drip melted wax
onto the cylindrical base which held the
Nishan Sahib’s post upright before affix-
ing the bottom of each ﬂickering candle
onto the ﬂat concrete on the top of the
base.

Rabbi James Gibson of Temple Sinai
in Squirrel Hill said that his only regret
wasthat it had taken a tragedy to bring so
many different communities together. He
noted that he felt’ there was some com-
monality between Sikh beliefs and his
own. L

“It was comforting to-see how closely
Sikh scriptures parallel our own,” he said.

Gibson also mentioned that there
were three other rabbis present.

Speaking after the vigil concluded,
Hickton reiterated that law enforcement
is committed to preventing hate crimes
and that in recent years the Department
ofJustice has implemented outreach pro-
grams to the Sikh, Arab and Muslim com-
munities in an attempt to protect their
members’ civil rights.

Hickton also discussed the FBI’s Joint
Terrorism Task Forces, which investigate
potential threats, but cited the difficulty
in anticipating such attacks by individu-
als like Page, who apparently acted alone.

“We spend a lot of time in our office
trying to prevent things like [the Oak
Creek shooting], but there’s a difference
between preventing something like this
and anticipating it,” he said. E

On a personal level, Hickton reiterat-

1 ed the shock he felt at hearing of the Aug.

5 tragedy.

“If you listened to the service tonight,
it isvery‘ hard for anyone who is hinged
and reasonable to disagree with the prin-
ciples of this wonderfulucommunity,” he
said. I

HARDING

three-fourths of enrollment at any University
is comprised of continuing students, and a big
part of his job is to keep retainment numbers
healthy.-

“Retention rate is high at Pitt, and we want
to keep it there,” Harding said.

In Rupert’s mind, the biggest challenge
facing Harding in his new j ob will be maintain-
ing the level of excellence that the admissions
ofﬁce has already established.

The department received an Ofﬁce of Ex-
cellence award from Provost and Vice Chan-
cellor Patricia Beeson in 2000 and has taken
Pitt’s annual applications total from 15,880

applications in 2002 to 24,873 in 2012, ac-
cording to Kellie Kane, an assistant director
of admissions and ﬁnancial aid. .
Rupert seemed assured that Hardingis the
best man to take on the challenge of continu-
ing the success. '
A ‘‘Here’s what I said to the provost: If she had

called me into her ofﬁce and said to me, ‘Go out I

through the land and ﬁnd the perfect match
forthe University of Pittsburgh,’ I would have
come back with Marc Harding,” Rupert said.

Harding’s former colleagues also praised
his performance.

Phil Caffrey, director of admissions opera-
tions and policy at the University of Iowa and
Harding’s co-worker there for 15 years, said
that Harding was greatly respected and well

liked at the University, and he said that regard
resulted from Harding’s integrity, talent and
occasionally goofy persona.

“We worked incredibly hard, but it didn’t
feel like it,” Caffrey said. ' I ~

Part of that might be because Harding fo-

cuses on the importance of relationships in
his managerial style.

He subscribes to a method known as “Situ-
ational Management,” coined by author Ken
Blanchard in his book of the same title.

“It’s doing the really hard work of me get-

- ting to know you as well as I can, look at the

positive in you, in terms of what gifts you have,
what you bring to the table, and then manage
appropriately,” Harding said.

He feels that, too often, things fall apart

because too little attention is paid to the per-
sonal aspect of things.

“A lot of it is just investing the time and
getting to know who they are,-and sometimes
even trying to dig down deep and go, “What
are they really asking? What are they really
wanting? What are they really needing?”
Harding said. _

Harding hasn’t moved any of his things
into his new office yet, but he says that when
he does, one of the very few things he’ll put
on the wall is a Maya Angelou quote recom-
mended to him by a co-worker at Iowa.

“I’ve learned that people will forget what
you said, people will forget what you did, but
people will never forget how you made them

erage incomes of $20,000 a year. Last year,
the federal government spent $5,500 for
each beneﬁciary, according to the Congres-
sional Budget Ofﬁce, which projects that cost
will rise to between $8,600 and $9,600 by
2030. Ryan would cap the spending at $7,400
per senior. So unless costs grow much more
slowly than expected, the average retiree on

Medicare would have to pay between $1,200“

and $2,400 a year. The amount would rise
overtime and would probably be higher for

those with chronic health problems.

Taxes

Ryan’s plan would keep the tax cuts en-
acted under President George W. Bush and
add an additional $4.5 trillion in cuts over
the next decade. It would do that by replac-
ing the current six tax rates with two —— 10
percent and 25 percent. It would also elimi-
nate the Alternative Minimum Tax and cut
corporate taxes.

Not all Americans would get a tax cut,
however. The plan would repeal tax breaks for
low-income families with children and other
changes adopted in 2009 under Obama. The
net result would be atax increase for the bot-
tom ﬁfth of households and a big tax cut at

' the top, according to the Tax Policy Center,

a nonpartisan Washington think tank.

In many cases, low-income households
would see a tax increase of $100 or less, but
some would be hit harder. Among households
earning between $10,000 and $20,000 a
year, about 1 in 5 would get a tax increase
averaging more than $1,000, the Tax Policy
Center analysis showed. Households earning
more than $1 million a year would get nearly
40 percent of the beneﬁts of the plan, with a
cut averaging about $265,000. Ryan has not
challenged those ﬁgures.

Those tax cuts would reduce overall fed-
eral revenue far below the level of spending
that Ryan- would allow. The result would be
a very large deﬁcit — larger than Obama
envisions. To keep that from happening, Ryan

 V says he would eliminate existing tax breaks to

A “broaden the base” of the tax code. i

“What we’re saying is take away the tax
shelters that are uniquely enjoyed by people
in.the top tax brackets so they can’t shelter as
much money from taxation,” Ryan said in a
CBS “60 Minutes” interview in mid-August.

While upper-income taxpayers pay a lot
of taxes, many of the tax beneﬁts they use
are either supported by Ryan and Romney
or don’t come close to closing the gap.

One of the largest beneﬁts for upper-
income taxpayers, for example, is the lower
tax rate for capital gains. Ryan, like Rom-

ney, opposes raising the capital gains tax
rate. Indeed, in 2010, when Ryan unveiled
his plan, it called for entirely eliminating
taxes on capital gains, interest and divi-
dends. Romney opposed that idea during
the Republican primaries. Ryan has never
disowned it, but did not address the topic
in this year’s version of the plan. ’

The remaining big tax preferences all
have huge political support -—- the mort-
gage interest deduction, the exclusion of
employer-provided health insurance from
income, the charitable contribution deduc-
tion. Changing those would increase taxes on
middle—income households, which Romney
has said he won’t do. Not ‘changing_them

Medicaid

The biggest single source of cost savings
in Ryan’s budget would come from cutting

Medicaid, the joint state—federal program 4

that provides health care for the poor and

disabled, and a companion program that .

pays for health care for children.

Now serving 58 million low-income chil-
dren, disabled adults and seniors a year,
Medicaid is the nation’s main health care

' safety net. Much of the spending on the pro-

gram goes to long-term care forseniors,
largely in nursing homes, which Medicare
does not cover. ’

Under the Ryan plan, funding would be
cut by a third, according to the CBO, and
the remaining federal funds would be given
to the states as a block grant to use as they
wish in providing care to the poor.

Conservatives have long argued that giv-
ing state and local governments greater con-
trol would save money by making Medicaid
more efficient. The budget office said in its
analysis this year that “even with signiﬁ-
cant efﬁciency gains, states would need to
increase their spending on these programs,
make considerable cutbacks in them, or
both.” Medicaid already makes up one of
the largest shares of most states’ budgets,
making new state funds unlikely.

Medicaid pays doctors and hospitals sub-
stantially less than they get from private
insurance or Medicare. In many states, eligi-
bility requirements are extremely tight. For
example, 30 states do not allow coverage for
parents who earn more than $9,500 a year,
according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Expanding Medicaid had been a central
part of Obama’s health care law. Ryan’s bud-

,— get would repeal that expansion along with

the rest of the law.
Defense and domestic spending

y ' One important display of priorities in

' Ryan’s budget is the.trade—off between de-

fense spending and domestic programs
other than Social Security, Medicare and
Medicaid. 0

Last summer, Congress and the White
House reached a deal that would trigger
automatic across-the-board spending cuts
of nearly $1 trillion over 10 years, begin-
ningjan. 2 —— half from defense, half from
domestic programs. The automatic cuts
would be stopped if Congress reached a
plan to reduce the deﬁcit.

Ryan would upend that deal. Instead of
cutting defense by half a trillion dollars over
the next 10 years —— which Obama also op-
poses -— Ryan would increase the military
budget by $300 billion over the decade.

Ryan would keep in place the across-the-
board cuts on the domestic side and deepen
them by $700 billion more over the decade.

' Some of the domestic spending cuts are
spelled out in Ryan’s blueprint -— a cut in
food stamps, for example, that would im-

pose new limits on the length of time re- ‘

cipients can receive aid. Like Medicaid, the
food stamp program would become a grant
to the states, giving local jurisdictions more

say in how the money is spent. Pell Grants» ..
for college students would similarly be ‘

capped, with new requirements that make
only lower—income students’ eligible. Worker
training programs would also be reduced.

Overall, the CBO said in its analysis that
undre_r‘Ryan’s budget, spending on defense
and all domestic programs other than Social
Security, Medicare and Medicaid would

i fall to .6 percent of the total economy by

2030, about half the current level. That
would mean a smaller share of the economy
going to federal domestic spending other
than entitlements than at any time since
the New Deal. I

OPINIONS

THE SCHAFFIDAVIT

With these tips, group projects    
don’t mean the death of happiness

Matt Schaff
Columnist

When an academic year begins,
students often prepare by looking
for ways to save time. Hoping to ﬁt
more productivity into the same
168-hour school week, we search
our memories of past academic
activities for places warranting

» improvement. Often, those places

are obvious. For example, cutting
down involvement in ﬂoor—wide
Halo tournaments, Facebook com-
ment wars and weeknight alcohol
binges opens up time for studying
and the possibility of healthy cir-
cadian rhythms. ’

But this semester, more of stu-
dents’ attempts to cut back on lost

time should be directed to optimize

a subtler time suck: group projects.
I really should clarify that group
projects only pose to assault the
schedules of a small portion of stu-
dents. For many others, in fact, a
teacher assigning a group project
constitutes nothing more than a
de facto gift of free time. That is,
just as in high school, collegiate
group projects suffer heavily from
the free-rider problem: Twenty
percent of participants produce
80 percent of the work. The other
80 percent get to have their grade
and eat cake, too. ‘
I’ve never been a free rider, and
I say that with chagrin, not pride.
Rather, I hold a strange respect for
those who manage to take advan-
tage of the awkward social situation

L presented by group projects to suc-

cessfully skirt any semblance of re-
sponsibility. I’m not so impressive.
Upon project assignment, instead
of putting on an artful performance
that allows me to spend would-be
project time to address any other
of college life’s tasks, I’m pushed by,
let’s say, internal forces to do some-
thing temporally taxing: meaning-
fully participate. Be it a tinge of
perfectionism, an appreciation of
industriousness or a nascent psy-
chosis —— whatever it is, I choose to
pour time into group projects when
I could otherwise feast on the fruits
of classmates’ labor.

Given the preceding rhetoric,
you might think I’m about to en-

dorse free riding as a worthy tool in
college students’ time-saving play-
book. But if you’re receptive to such
an argument, this column isn’t for
you. Instead, Pm concerned with
helping those like me: those sorry
souls similarly cursed with the un-
conscious impulse to throw time,
energy and office supplies at any
assignment coming their way. If

you’re among those who just can’t

help but participate in group proj-
ects, here’s how to convert the free
riders around you into more-than-
somewhat—helpful group members
this semester:

The less you
look like you
know what

you’re‘doing,  
the better. That
doesn’t mean
  acting dumb
or catatonic 

Try not to seem too loud, inter-
ested or conﬁdent

Students inclined to hop on

their peers’ backs start scouting .

for roomy shoulders the ﬁrst time
the group convenes. To promote
more equitable teamwork over the
course of the project, do your best
to create an environment where
everyone’s at the same apparent

state of motivation. The less you’

look like you know what you’re do-
ing, the better. That doesn’t mean
acting dumb or catatonic; you just
have to increase the likelihood that
your groupmates will suddenly re-
alize the need to step up.

Deﬁne roles, early
Too much aimless pandemo-

nium gives wannabe free riders a
welcome opportunity to disengage;

. it’s a lot easier to ignore the task

at hand when you don’t know how
you’re going to contribute to it.
To combat this, ask someone else

_— remember, you can’t introduce

yourself as the worker bee —- to
email everyone a list of responsi-
bilities and manage the ensuing
thread of project-related emails. Be
prepared for group members who
will try to indeﬁnitely postpone the
role-assignment phase by saying
things like, ‘.‘We’ll take another look
at this next week.”

Set up group-meetings with your
professor

Getting your whole group in a
room together is likely essential
for the success of your project —-or
at least the fairness of it. But "doing
so is more of an art than a reﬂex.
What youneed are powerful incen-
tives. Sure, you could try food or
TV, but unless you’re getting ﬁlet
mignon delivered, your best bet is
somehow to make group members
think their grades are on the line. If
you can get them to worry so much
about their professor comparing
them to fellow group members
— and that comparison coloring
individual grades — that they at-
tend these joint meetings, you’d be
well on your way to taking work off
your plate. ’

Third-grade tactics

Things might be looking bad.
Let’s say you’ve done all the right
things but your group members
insist — subtly or not — on giv-
ing up their project to the magical
worker fairies in the sky (you). In
this case, your last resort is to at-
tempt engendering that “we’re all

in this together” feeling in people’s

hearts. Yes, that means team-build-
ing exercises. Don’t just learn group
members’ names; inquire about
their majors or, if you’re daring
enough, their thoughts on current
events. But camaraderie doesn’t
grow on trees, so if that fails, con-
sider coffee — you’re about to have
a lot of late nights on your own.

The songs that top the summertime
charts are often‘ faster and perkier
than the tunes popular in colder
seasons. B.ut this summer more
than ever, these catchy rhythms
and lyrics have paralleled an equally
upbeat national and local attitude.

The popular hits of summer
2012 are in many ways typical of
summers past. There are lyrics that

of the same chords and cliche ex-
pressions of simple teenage love.
Summer songs are usually upbeat
— the sort of music you want to
listen to on a long drive. But this
-summer’s songs are exceptionally
so; and when mixed with other
signs. of progress along our coun-

try’s highway, they ﬁnally don’t

don’t actually rhyme, repetitions .

Hey, ljust met you,and
things are looking up

seem too out of place.

It was on a recent 11-hour road
trip that I ﬁrst noticed the similar-
ity of this year’s hits, regardless of
how often I changed the radio sta-
tion. For nearly 500 miles between
Cleveland and New York City, be-
hind the wheel of my Subaru station
wagon, I heard ultra—sweet songs

‘ such as Carly Rae_]epsen’s “Call Me

Maybe” and Demi Lovato’s “Give
Your Heart a B_rea ” on repeat, and
not much else. I

On road trips in recent sum-
mers, these happy summertime hits
would seem at odds with a nation

_ struggling with bursting housing

bubbles and major national catas-
trophes. It was hard to enjoy “Cali-
fornia Gurls” or “I Gotta Feeling”
between bleak job reports during

THE STAMATTACK

Please stop takingpictures of ﬁreworks

Really, what’s the value of that hiurry photo you took on your iPhone? Melinda Maloney | Contributing Staff

Nick Stamatakis
Assistant Oj)z'm'0ns Editor

Scene: a country music concert in
downtown Nashville, Tenn. The
crowd is a good mix of die-hard coun-
try fans and more casual onlookers,
like myself. A famous singer gets on
the stage.

With the sky now partially dark,
thousands of iPhone screens pop
up and hover over the crowd. As the
night grows darker, the lights are
morphed from individual rectangles
to resemble a net of Christmas lights
entrapping the audience.

Of course, iPhone photography
isn’t just a Nashville thing. Kenny
Chesney at Heinz Field was the same
way. Same with the Dave Matthews
Band — or at least I’m guessing it
was.

Even less famous and notable

events get some level of amateur ‘

iPhone photography. At both the
Erie County Fourth ofjuly ﬁreworks
display and the Boyz II Men Fan
Jam at PNC Park in June, I saw the
same thing: people photographing

blurry, distant things happening too
far away to look halfway decent on a
camera phone.

Call me crazy, but do we really
need to take this many pictures?

I can’t quite ﬁgure out why spec-
tators everywhere feel so obligated
to capture such scenes. These aren’t
pictures of friends at the concert.
This isn’t one or two still photos of
the stage. Instead, these are hours
of fuzzy footage of ﬁreworks and
indecipherable noises that we are
documenting just for the sake of
documenting.

The numbers showcasing our love
of video and photography are abso-
lutely staggering. In half a minute
-— roughly the amount of time it took
you to read to this point within this
article —— 30 hours ofvideo have been
uploaded to YouTube, according to
a statement by Google. A month of
YouTube uploads contains more
video than the entirety of 60 years
of Big Three broadcast television.

I don’t imagine people actually
watch these things. When it goes out
into great cyberspace, most people
don’t: Roughly a third of all YouTube

videos have fewer than 100 views,
according to Watchmojo.com, an
online video production company.

But it isn’t much better when this
stuff stays on our phones or Face-
book accounts. Does anybody get
gooey—eyed and sentimental look-
ing at a picture of the Erie County
Fourth of July ﬁreworks show? Or
at a more spectacular show in New
York or Washington?

Maybe it is the social element of
these events that we want to capture.
We want to Facebook and Instagram
all this fun stuff we do and broadcast
it to the world (incidentally, if I ever
see anybody Instagram—ing a ﬁre-
work, there will be a world of pain).

But even here, the marginal ben-
eﬁt from posting hundreds ofblurry
pictures is not that great. Maybe we
get a few extra shots of dopamine
from gleefully spending hours telling
the world about how awesome our
lives are, but overall, you are not im-
pressing anybody or even genuinely
expressing more of the experience to

your social network by holding your j

Don't get into the
Netflix. rut this year

Naomi Borrebach
Opz’nz'ons Editor

Does this cycle of undergraduate
life sound familiar to you? Wake
up, go to class, study. Go to a group
project meeting, outline an essay,
have a small breakdown in the li-
brary. Go to work. Sleep. Wakeup
— it’s Friday! Party away the pain
of your academic life for two days.‘
Nervously check Facebook for any
incriminating evidence. Sleep. Af-
ter a hearty breakfast, promptly
have another small breakdown
over the state of your essay, this

time in the Cathedral Commons

while nursing a splitting headache.

Go to work. Repeat until summer
break, when the entire undergrad-

uate population of Pitt simultane-

ously collapses with exhaustion
and then radically changes its life-

style for three months.

While it is all too tempting to
spend weekdays in an anxious fren-
zy of activity and to let go of all of
the week’s tension onthe weekend,
I think that we could all beneﬁt
from taking some of the easy-going
spirit of summer with us into the
academic year. During the summer,
most of us don’t have to alternate
between the extremes of intense
academic and work stress during
the week and total relaxation on
the weekends. Because obligations
are fewer and the weather is nicer,
it’s easier to strike a balance in our
scheduling and attitudes.

Here are a few ways to take the
relaxed feeling of summer with you
this year, even as the leaves turn
brown and the piles of textbooks
get taller.

i. Schedule fun activities during
the week

During the school year, it’s
hard to ﬁnd time during the week
to have fun. So make sure that you
plan time for fun activities to take a
break from the chaos. If you make
a schedule of your week in advance,
try to keep in mind relaxing or fun
things that you’d like to do when
planning your schedule. And work
ahead of time so that you don’t end
up skipping out on having coffee
with friends or going to a movie be-
cause deadlines are approaching.

2. Be productive on the weekends

During the summer, it’s a lot
easier for me to be productive on
the weekends because I don’t feel
like it’s my last opportunity to relax
before the onslaught of work starts
on Monday. A balanced attitude
toward work and relaxation makes
it a lot easier to actually ﬁnish some
homeworkbn Saturday afternoon,
instead of idly staring at a textbook
as a precursor to a nap.

During the
  summer,
most of us
don’t have
to alternate
between the
extremes
of intense
academic and
work stress
duﬁngthe
week and
relaxation on
the weekends.

3. Do yoga (or some other exer-
cise)

Although you can’t do sunrise
yoga on the beach in Pittsburgh,-
you can get the same beneﬁts by
taking an exercise class or pulling
out a yoga mat in your apartment.
Enlist some friends or roommates
and you’ll all get the physical, so-
cial, and mood-boosting beneﬁts of
thoseamazing beachfront exercise
classes —— even when snow covers
the ground.

4. Take spontaneous trips

One of the best parts ofsummer
is that you can go on vacation. Try
to bring summer into the school

year by getting some friends to-

THE SCHAFFIDAVIT

Bring Google Streetview to Pitt, bring Pitt to the world

Matt Schaff
Columnist

Pitt should welcome Google cameras onto
campus. Consider this:

’ It’s August, and you’re a rising high
school senior living in, say, ‘Fresno, Calif.
Maintaining that she has your best interests
in mind, your mom is once again harping on
you to make an honest effort in the college
search. So, half to appease her and half to
imagine life outside of making the bed and
meetingcurfew, you turn to the instrument
you think best-suited to aid in your decision-
making process —— the Internet. '

Somewhere down the line you come
across a school whose mountains, bridges

. and programs interest you, but whose dis-

tant location invalidates feasible travel. It
calls itself the University of Pittsburgh. After
perusing departmental websites and student
testimonials, you inevitably reach a certain
question, which you subsequently run into

a wall trying to fully answer: What is it like
to go to Pitt? .

Sure, forums like College Conﬁdential,
statistical resources like the Princeton Re-
view and U.-S. News and World Report, stu-
dent publications and even pictures of cam-
pus buildings and activitieseall contribute to

.a meaningful “what it’s like” understanding.

But what if you could add a whole new way
of pre-evaluating a school’s “feel” to these
perspectives: A self-guided, 360-degree tour
through campus, attainable from any wired
computer and unlikely, thanks to a robust
cloud infrastructure, to ‘ever go offline?
Such a resource would undoubtedly be
valuable to prospective students (and par-
ticipating universities), and that’s why Pitt
should join the growing list of U.S. univer-
sities partnering with Google Street View.
Since 2009, institutions of higher edu-
cation from Dartmouth College to the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania to the University of

California at Riverside have invited search '

giant" Google from the “streets” onto their

grounds..Thanks to the Google Street View A

Partners program, the nooks and crannies of
27 major U.S. college and university campus-
es are wide open for public view, integrated
seamlessly into Google Maps. ’

Similarly plastering its walkways and
non—street public spaces in plain electronic
sight, Pitt could make college decisions eas-
ier for prospective students who live a sig-
niﬁcant distance from Pitt’s campus. Think
about how your “initial sense” of Pitt could
have changed if you could effortlessly take an

' — after- class stroll alongside the Cathedral of
_ Learning, attend an event in Schenley Quad

or chill out on Towers Patio, all in under
ﬁve minutes from the convenience of your
computer or smartphone. Far more helpful
than the building—by—building slideshow
currently available on Pitt’s website, a Street
View representation of Pitt’s campus could
instantly familiarize prospects with the en-
vironment that would surround them should

they choose to attend Pitt. And that’s not
even mentioning the emotional value such
a resource could provide to alumni and he-
licopter parents. ‘

More than just individuals stand to ben-
eﬁt from a Street-View-enhanced Pitt. With
Pitt’s architecture and other physical ameni-
ties at the world’s scrutinizing ﬁngertips, the
visibility ofthe University as awhole could
experience a boost (I suppose as long as we

cut our grass). James Grant, assistant vice .

chancellor of strategic communications at
Riverside, agrees that such Google part-
nerships could give sometimes-overlooked
schools another chance tdprove themselves.
“Why not look for an advantage and make
sure people are aware of what we’ve got right
now?” he said in an Inside Higher Ed report
in July. '

Alex needs to attend a 9 a.m. psy-
chology class. The alarm clock
reads 8:50 p.m. What does he
need to do in order to make it to
class on time? Assuming a frantic
commute to the classroom will
take ﬁve minutes, he only has ﬁve
minutes to get out the door. He

needs a strategy.

‘ It’s a good thing he has one.

Alex is an on—campus college
student and, like any class—bound
student, has felt the pressure of
a timed commute before. Being
a minute late could result in the
unfortunate fate of having to open
a closed classroom door in front
of his entire psychology class. In
addition, Alex wants to lessen the
possibility of forgetting a wallet or
reusing the odor-ridden T—shirt
closest to the door. Although oth-
ers might adopt a strategy that
resigns them to these unfortunate
fates, Alex always follows his game
plan that seemingly deﬁes the laws
of time.

techniques, Alex .will practice his

“Five-Minute Morning” strategy '

in order to consistently reach his
psychology class on time.

Channel the adrenaline rush

(8:50»a.m.) His eyes are slightly
blurred from awakening, but the
red outlines of the alarm clock on
his coffee table hold true to form.
The realization of the time sets
in. Within“ seconds, Alex’s body

receives a shock of adrenaline, and

he hurls the covers from his dorm
room bed into the air, setting his
plan in motion. As the covers fall
elegantly to the ground, he gets
to his feet. A sudden panic begins
to set in as his mind races and his
pupils dilate. With renewed in-
tent, he stumbles forward and as-
serts, out loud, “I’m going to make
my class.” Alex recalls the game
plan and uses this initial rush of
adrenaline as the foundation of
his now—focused state.

Back to School: But

Andrew Kaback
A Columnist

Do you have that feeling in your
stomach? You know the one: it’s
right between dating your best
friend’s ex and your secret attrac-
tion tojustin Bieber songs. I know
I have it and there can be only one
explanation: school is about to
start.

Now, I know that many of you -

may be thinking that returning to
campus sounds almost as good as
the Pirates returning to at least av-
erage play. But I assure you, now
that I’ve had a couple of years under
my belt, going back to school ‘is
awful. It’s like “being called on at-a
Daniel Tosh stand-up” meets “look—
ing through internet photographs
of friends who once dressed up as
Joe Paterno for a football game.”
It always sounds like such a
good idea. After all, we normally
think about the good stuff: new-
found friends, endless parties and
shunning the guy on your ﬂoor
that thinks Antoon’s isn’t as good
as Sorrento’s. But you know what

else sounded like a good idea once?
“Hey Zuckerberg, we should really

think about taking this Facebook

thing public.” .

While I usually side with House
Lannister (c’mon, who doesn’t love
the little guy?), I must agree that
going back to school means only
one thing: winter is coming. It will
be so cold. The ﬁrst two weeks of
school are deceptive, freshmen.
The leaves do look pretty for about
a week after classes begin, but then
they die. If the new school year
means anything, it is that you had
better remember to wear a coat.

All of those exciting feelings
you think you have entering the
ﬁrst semester evaporate as soon
as the ﬁrst snow falls. Sure, there’s
a millisecond where we all think
that sledding in Schenley will be
fun, but the realization of walking
to class in the wind and snow gets
rid of that pretty quickly. And then
there’s the whole “coat at a party”
debate. What do you do with it?
Should I awkwardly carry it around
all night or leave it in a place where
it might get stolen? Ah, I might as

late-night inspiration or by vir-
tue of necessity created by use of
communal restrooms, Alex had
established his hygiene bag be-
forehand. This includes an assort-
ment of toiletries including face
wipes, hand sanitizer, deodorant,
gum and a comb. The small, un-
zipped black leather bag provides
a pseudo-shower experience in
one-tenth of the time of a regular
bathroom excursion. Using the
aforementioned items provides a
quick cleanup for Alex. He pops a
stick of gum into his mouth, pro-
viding at least a facade of spear-
mint over his morning breath, and
proceeds to his closet.

Master the “Hot Swap”

(8:52 a.m.) Swinging open the
closet door reveals a set of cloth-
ing. Within a minute, he is but-
toning his shirt and tying on his
shoes. How did he doait so fast?

You may note during your video
game playing the tendency of cer-
tain characters to suddenly change
armor or clothing with minimal
effort. This is called a “Hot Swap.”

The same idea, surprisingly, can
apply to real life. (Unless Alex en-
joys wearing his pajama pants to
class, which is a whole other issﬁ“
— but I digress). The goal of hot
swapping is to spend almost no
time searching for an appropri-
ate set of clothing by preparing
clothing the night before. Alex has
already systematically placed a
matching top, bottom and shoe
combination togetherin his clos-

et. Socks and underwear come as .

a standard feature in the package.
With proper preparation, the hot
swap takes 54 seconds.

Now, he both smells clean and
looks ready to leap out of the door.
But is he truly ready for class? Not
quite.

Locate the “Drop Zone” and per-
form the KWC

(8:54 a.m.) Like a ﬁghter pilot
locking in on his target, Alex’s eyes
dart to his "Drop Zone,” located on
the coffee table next to his alarm
clock. He has established a speciﬁc

- location, a 1—foot by 1—foot space

that through the day serves as a.

Use the ‘5—Minute Morning’ strategy to get to class on time

drop-off point for his essential
items. By habit, every time he en-
ters his dorm room, he places his
keys, wallet and cellphone (KWC)
in the same spot, making it an easy
and quick task to locate and gather
his belongings. '

The performance of the KWC
maneuver requires a Matrix-like
ability to stop time. With adrena-
line rushing and time expiring,
Alex asks himself, “Do I have
my keys, wallet and cell phone
on me?” A pause for conﬁrma-
tion ensures that these items are
not forgotten, and increases the
chance that additional items such
as a pen and notebook leave with
Alex, too. ’

As the class-bound student
turns the door knob, he takes a
calm breath and shuts the door

~ behind him. Assuring himself that

his feet are still attached to his
legs, he exhales conﬁdently. It is
8:55 a.m.

What’s his next ﬁve-minute
strategy?

Run. Like mad.

Write Jonathan at ﬁscherjd2@
upmc.edu. I

don’t bother getting too excited

well not go out.

Of course, returning to the
classroom also means that we must
re-enter the holy of holies in annoy-
ances: group projects. Every time I
see the tweets about returning to
the good old 4-1-2, my, soul cringes

So my advice
for you as the
school year
begins? Make
this one count.

at the thought of another intro-
ductory class syllabus reading: 30
percent of your grade will be based
on group work. Thirty percent? Is
that some kind of Walmart rollback
gimmick gone wrong?

Not only is group work worth.

a larger portion of my grade than
the winning percentage of the Pitt
football team in games that actually

mean something, I also have no
control over what the other people
in my group decide to do. Has any
professor on the face of the Earth
ever worked with other people?
Have you ever tried doing a slide-
show with the kid who hasn’t been
to class for eight weeks?
Ultimately, people forget that
outside of the shenanigans, col-
lege life primarily consists of do-
ing schoolwork. Schoolwork sucks!
Homework, essays and midterms
line up like there’s free bread dur-
ing the Depression. Then there’s
clubsand organizations, interview-
ing for jobs and internships and
trying to stay sane all the while.
The ﬁrst week back, with its
limited homework and classes
devoted to the rules of the course,
is certainly the best, but after that,
your life is ﬁtll of school at every
corner. When we can manage a
week without a bomb threat, we
start to feel like we would do any-
thing for summer. It’s one thing
to have awork schedule, but the
endless unknown about whether
or not you’ve studied enough for a

test drives us all mad. ,

OK, so maybe I really don’t
think that school is that bad. I
guess what I really hate about the
end of the summer is that it means
we’re all one year closer to the end.
It brings up the scary questions
about what we want to do when we
grow up and how we are planning
to make it all work. '

There’s a world out there that’s
consumed with rent payments,
work schedules and where to buy
groceries, and I want to be ready
for it. Unfortunately, the begin-
ning of a school year forces me to
remember that there will be an end
to our time at Pitt. '

So my advice for you as the
school year begins? Make this one
count. Maybe it’s a new club that
you should joinor a hobby that you
should take up. Pretty soon we’re
all going to be staring down adult-
hood, and you want to be sure that
there are no regrets. So stay away
school year. Give me a bit more
summertime.

The Great Recession and the John Cusack
thriller “2012” both share similar philoso-
phies and economic ideas.

It’s 2007 (or 2011) and everything is going
great. Adjusting wages are keeping involun-
tary unemployment at zero and markets are
properly valuing risky assets (or Los Angeles
isn’t engulfed in ﬂames)..You can have a job
(and Cusack can stick to capturing the at-
tention of window-bound valedictorians).

Then one day the ground literally disap-
pears from beneath your feet. An earthquake,
or in the case of the economy, a gross misal-
location of capital, has destroyed the calm.
Cusack has to go from passively holding a
boom box overhead to driving into the wil-
derness to save his family. Previously safe
jobs in services and manufacturing disappear
as the economy tumultuously shifts resources
to other sectors aided by outsourcing and
automation.

The time it takes to recover from this
shifting constitutes a recession. I never saw
“2012,” so I don’t know if .Cusack’s character
lived to see his‘ family live a happy, fruitful
life. Luckily, unlike in the movies, things
in the economy tend to settle down pretty
quickly: recessions are usually short enough

into this phenom-

that workers ﬁnd other uses for their skills
and eventually move to other sectors.

But the Great Recession of 2007 doesn’t
seem to want to end.‘Month after month of

Take a minute and think back to freshman
year of high school. As you walked to the
bus with your clarinet tucked away in your
backpack to hide your inner band geek, the
images of those television shows about high
school became real. You preferred ‘to not
have your head stuffed down that toilet in
the last stall of the second ﬂoor bathroom.
Being a freshman sucked.

Now, think of freshman year of college.
Literally nobody cares what you’re doing or
who you are, let alone your age. See, in col-
lege, everyone leaves everyone else alone.
But there is one big man on campus target-
ing the ‘freshmen. Actually, there are two.

Every year, during the last days of Au-
gust and into early September, the College
Democrats and College Republicans take
to the streets of Oakland, working hard to
get students —— especially freshmen _—- to
register to vote. Insert a sigh of relief here,
that’s not sobad! This is a completely differ-
ent situation than the bullies you avoided on

this is the ﬁrst chance that political activists
have to reach out to you. As you’re cornered
in Towers Lobby in the coming weeks, there

country. This year is more important than
most — it’s a presidential election year. By
registering to vote, you can pick the person

you want to be the President of the United ,

States of America for the next four years. I’m
sure there are some nifty T-shirts, stickers
and other ﬂashy swag for you to advertise
your elite sta-

Simply put, we are the age group most

ﬁcials because we are going to be around to
see the outcome of the selected administra-

citizen population is notoriously the most
likely to vote, the issues will stay with us,
logically speaking, for much longer. You,
at 18, have the right and the power to let
your voice be heard on policies that matter
to you by voting.

And even if your party or candidate
doesn’t win, wouldn’t you rather be able
to say that you voted against something
instead of pinning the hundredth perfect
bouquet of ﬂowers to your “Dream Wedding
<3!” board on Pinterest‘?

The groups of students asking you to
register to vote may seem intimidating,
or even annoying, but don’t you feel kind
of popular? The Democrats want you. So
do the Republicans. You could check the
“Independent” box if you don’t have a fa-
vorite or a preference. As a citizen of the
U.S. and as a new or lifelong resident of
Pennsylvania, you’re wanted. Exercise the
right that people have fought for on U.S. soil

Music not just noise, but a primal source of emotion -

Jonathan Fischer
Columnist

How many times have you heard
the tragic strokes of a violin or
the thumping,sounds'of a bass
drum and felt moved?

Music is composed, techni-
cally, of a combination of sounds

C and rhythms that generate a

wide variety of real emotional re-
sponses. Though those respons-
es might differ from listener to
listener, it seems increasingly
evident that a strong connection

. between music and emotional .

health is a common human ex-
perience — so much so that it’s
arguably vital to our emotional
health and well-being that we
take the time to appreciate that
many aspects of our body and
mind revolve around music.
Perhaps the best argument
for the undeniable relationship
between rhythmic tones and

the human psyche is that most '

people surround themselves with
music whenever possible. How
many students do you see with
headphones on while they shuf-

ﬂe to their next class? When was
the last time you were at a party

without some sort of rhythm

playing in the background?

-It’s not by mistake that our
culture embraces sound. Our
heartbeat is the constant music
or beat of life. Before that, it was
our mother’s pulse informing
us during our earliest period of
growth. Changes in these pulses
were and are deeply signiﬁcant
to-us. Movements we conduct
on an everyday basis, such as
walking, breathing and blinking
continue this identiﬁcation with
rhythm and are often reflected
in music.

Clearly, as human beings,
we are driven and affected by
music. These-motions are con-
nected to emotions, and by
better understanding the two,
we can better understand our
health. University of California,
San Diego psychologist Vladimir
Konecni —— author of “Docs mu-
sic induce emotion? A theoreti-
cal and methodological analysis”
— agrees. He has written that
“the idea that music gives rise

to thoughts about signiﬁcant
others, about emotionally rich
social situations and one’s past
experiences” does in fact play a
part in the “transformation of
heard sound into emotional state
via memories and contempla-
tion.”-‘

And this connection isn’t one

— that stops early in life — it seems

to affect emotional health longer
than almost anything else. My
mother was an activities director
for an Alzheimer’s care center,
where she observed that primi-
tive songs and melodies evoked
the most commonly observed
responses from patients. The
Alzheimer’s victims, in their un-
fortunate states, could repeat all
verses of songs from their youth
from memory due to communi-
cation through music. When the
music stopped playing, so did the
patient’s singing and awareness.
There was hardly a need for a
doctorto apply numerical data
or fill out a prescription to show
that the elderly beneﬁt from
musical communication. Not to
mention, it’s comforting to know

that there is something we can
hold on to. Inside our thoughts,
even in old age, is a deep—seated
connection to our own musical
beginnings. In a way, it’s a natu-
ral safeguard for the purpose of
keeping ourselves healthy and
sane.

People who are not paying
attention to the rhythm and
musicof their surroundings to_
expand their emotional reper-
toires risk becoming unhealthy.
While it might be hard to gather
numerical data regarding the
types of responses compared to
the number of emotions a person
might experience, a lack of musi-
cal stimuli must be detrimental.
Just as muscles atrophy without
physical stimulation,.so does hu-
man well-being deteriorate with-
out emotional stimulation. While
doctors might deﬁne health with
vital statistics on a pad of paper,
the more appropriate and mean-
ingful deﬁnition includes a di-.
verse range of emotions evoked
over a lifetime.

Sometimes, we don’t know
why we feel better after listening

to music, but there is a deﬁnite
sense of an emotional response
generated by listening. If we are
truly to be able to live in a state
of well-being, we need to pay at-
tention to sounds and the music
around us. It could even be said
that our survival depends on
it, as our emotions play a huge
part of how we define ourselves.
How can there be a true sense of
health and emotional well-being
without a need to seek external
musical stimuli?

While we might not know why
we associate certain emotions
with certain types of music, we
should at least recognize the
connection between the two, as
well as the health beneﬁts that
emotional awareness — and con-
sequently, music — can provide.

And if you get a bit jittery like
I do when attemptingto sing at a
karaoke bar, just remember that
you might be adding a healthy
new emotional experience to
your listeners’ arsenals — com-
pliments of your voice.

What did you dothis summer? Consider wri

2 Elizabeth Weisel
Columnist

Elementary school was a simpler

time. During the school year, we ’

had nothing to look forward to ex-
cept summer, a time when our days
could be ﬁlled with bike rides and
ice cream trucks and soccer leagues.
Maybe fora week or two we’d go on
vacation with our families to places
like Gettysburg or Cape May, and
then the next thing we’d know we’d
be back to school in the fall. ,
Inevitably, within the ﬁrst week
back to school, our new teachers
would make us write the one essay
we wrote every year: “What I Did
This Summer?’ And as we wrote
those essays, we took a long, com-
prehensive look at how the ﬁm that
made up our summer days relaxed

. us and prepared us for the new year.

So why don’t we write those essays
anymore? What would change if
we did? ' '

I’m going to argue that a revival
of the summer essay would better
prepare students to return to school
in the fall semester, even if we are
long out of elementary school, so
that we can take time for self-re-

ﬂection.
The ﬁrst reason we need to

set apart time for self-reﬂection '

is to slowourselves down. Gone
are the days of spending our sum-
mers running around the neigh-
borhood chasing our neighbor’s
dog for hours on end. Instead, the
pressures of summer
jobs and internships
plague us, so we’re
constantly pushing
ourselves to do more.
I have worked at least
two jobs during each
of the past three sum-
mers, and I’ve barely
had time for myself.
It’s easy to get caught
up in everything you
have to do and forget
the meaning behind
the experiences.
When we take time
to sit down and write
about the things that
we’ve done and what
we’ve learned from them, we allow
ourselves a chance to sit back, re-
lax and enjoy the learning process.
Then we gain a better appreciation

. of how hard we worked or what

our work has meant. Maybe you
worked a job that you really hated,
but didn’t notice because you were
too busy to realize you didn’t like
what you were doing. Or maybe it
was the opposite: you loved your
work but got caught up in how much
there was to do.

I’m going to argue that
a revival of the summer
essay would better

  preparestudents to
return to school inthe fall
1 semester, even if we are I
long out of elementary

school".

Last summer I worked three
jobs, and while I was working I
didn’t think the tasks held much

signiﬁcance for me. I liked one over '

the other two, but not so noticeably

during the summer. Now when I
think back to that summer, I real-
ize that I really disliked one of my
jobs and loved another, and these
realizations changed the course of
my career path. Only after taking
time to reﬂect did I recognize the

. things that I learned from my sum-

mer jobs.
But summer isn’t
just about work. It’s
also a time for vaca-
tion and spending time
with friends and fam-
ily. The other reason we
need to take time for a
self-reﬂective essay is
to soak in the calm-
ing energy that graced
our summers — even
if it was sparse. For
some reason, in the
summer, we are much
' more willing to spend
an extra night out with
ourfriends to lie in the
grass and stargaze.
When we’re in school, the stress
of constant homework can weigh
down our evenings and even our
weekends. We forget what it was
like in the summer to sacriﬁce a

ting it down

couple of hours of sleep for the sake
of a fun night with friends.

If we make the effort to reﬂect
on the time we spent relaxing over
the summer, we can recognize that
it was good for our minds, bodies
and souls to take time off even when
it meant a little bit of sacriﬁce. If we
record our memories from sum-
mer nights we have something to
go back to when we’re feeling the
stress of our daily lives and remem-
ber the fresh scent of the summer.
We can let the memory of summer
sink deep into our skin and remind
us at the beginning of theyschool
year that whenever we get faced
with huge workloads or time-con-
suming jobs, we know that there is
another summer coming.

Even though it might seem ju-
venile, taking time to sit down and
write an essay simply titled “What
I Did This Summer” can give us a

' chance to reﬂect, slow down and

remember the feel of summer.
When we take the time to do these
things, we are better prepared for
the fall and the beginning of a new
school year. ‘

SONGS

‘the recession or hourly updates

on the BP oil spill in 2010. But this
summer, the songs made an ap-
propriate soundtrack as I passed
the signs of a country getting back
on its feet.

In surprisingly pretty Cleve-
land, progress is manifest in the
reinvented West Side, where each
week is marked by the grand open-
ings of restaurants and other new
businesses. In small towns that
sometimes seem little more than
exit signs along the interstate, there
are factories, such as GM’s Chevy
Cruze assembly plant in Lordstown,
Ohio, working at full production.
Across the hills ofPem1sylvania, old
strip mines are overshadowed by
miles of newly constructed — and
far more sustainable — windmills.
Even the spots of traffic brought
on by highway construction and
repairs were signs of progress.

From chart—topping veterans

like Katy Perry to the wholesome '

teens of One Direction, the upbeat
music does indeed match the signs
of American progress this summer.

The occasionally terrifying Nicki
Minaj shed her creepier alter egos
in the song “Starships” to encour-
age us to “reach up and touch the

sky.” A band ﬁttingly named Fun.
reminded us that “We Are Young,”
while One Direction, the summer’s
biggest boy band, told us that “What
Makes You Beautiful” is simply not
realizing that you are indeed beauti-
ful. With cheesy lines like “I wanna
give your heart a break,” these tunes
are optimistic enough to serveas
wedding vows at a shotgun wed-
ding. Even recently divorced Katy
Perry highlighted her ability to get
over heartbreak in her newest hit,
“Wide Awake.”

But you don’t need to be on a
highway to jive with the summer-
time tunes. In Oakland, a spirit of
progress consumes the campus. On
a stroll down Fifth Avenue, students
pass the old entrance of the now-
relocated Book Center and the
quick construction of a residence
hall.'In Alumni Hall, the Oﬂice of .
Admissions and Financial Aid has a
new chi_ef enrollment ofﬁcer for the
ﬁrst time in three decades. Even the
touch-ups to sidewalks along the
Cathedral or Schenley Quad remind
us that this is a season of progress.

Off campus, we are treated to
new restaurants such as Hello Bis-
tro and The Bagel Factory. Even
Bigelow Boulevard got a fresh
level of tar. Things were so good
in Pittsburgh this summer that the

perpetually defeated Pirates adopt- '

ed a winning attitude. The Buccos

Great beer prices/drink specials

entered the All—Star break leading
the division, and center ﬁelder An-
drew Mccutchen has become a vi-
able candidate for the MVP award.
Last summer, the soundtrack
to the Women’s World Cup was
Lady Gaga’s “Edge of Glory,” which
seemed especially ﬁtting, as the U.S.
team made it just to the edge before
losing in a shootout thriller to Ja-
pan. Japan received accolades for
its ability to turn out a champion-
ship team despite overcoming the
devastation at home brought on by
an earthquake and a tsunami. This
year, we expected a great deal from
Olympians, and those expectations
matched the music of the summer.
The oﬂicial song of the London
Olympic games was “Survival” by
Muse, in which the opening line is
a conﬁdent declaration that “life’s
a race / and I am gonna win.”
Summer smash hits will always
be upbeat and positive — it’s the
nature of the season. This year it is
refreshing to have an upbeat envi-
ronment to match. But before long,
we will ﬁnd ourselves making study
playlists again for long stays in Hill-
man Library and Posvar Hall. So
throw some Katy Perry and Justin

Bieber onto your iPhone, because V

if we can’t keep summer, we can at
least keep its upbeat attitude.

PIRATES

accuratelydescribe the Pirates for
the ﬁrst 15 years, one step forward
and off a cliff).

This insight is important in un-
derstanding the role government
has in helping workers transition.
Affluent business magnate Mark Cu-
ban could have bought the Pirates
and shoveled millions of dollars on a
team, as it was speculated he would
in 2009. We "might have won more,
but we would also be unproﬁtable —
an unacceptable long-term solution.
The potential Mark Cuban model
was not unlike programs ranging
from unemployment insurance ex-
tensions toincreased food stamps
e nobody would be getting closer to
the new, improved versions of them-
selves they must inevitably become.

Instead, government should be
all about transforming essential
things concerning the way our so-
ciety is structured. Strategies must
change and adapt. Those solutions
are too numerous to mention here,
but all revolve around a key point:
you must plan for tomorrow, not for
today to never end.

And on that note, I guess “2012”
and the economy are different.

GOOGLE  

on the Street View bandwagon, Pitt
should ﬁrst consider some veritable
concerns. Mainly, privacy could be-
come an issue. Yes, on one hand
the algorithms Google uses to blur
faces, obscure identifying informa-
tion and avoid unsightly visuals
aren’t perfect (this isn’t so much
of a problem, since Google sup-
posedly bendsto whatever terms
universities set and maintains an
online form to accept complaints
from users about content to be re-
moved). On the_other hand, several
government organizations around
the world — including the U.S. Fed-
eral Communications Commission
— have challenged Google with the
allegation that_the company_’s ve-
hicles have collected data beyond
photographs (such as personal data
from surrounding open Wi.-Fi net-
works), and partnering universities
therefore may want to worry about
data privacy..

But, in the face of the obvious
beneﬁts, such concerns are sur-
mountable. We’ve already allowed
Google into so many other aspects
of our lives, sharing Pitt’s walkways
with it wouldn’t be so different.

iPhone in the air for 30 minutes.

In other words, we take all these pictures
for almost no obvious reason. We are all just
capturing these leisure events for posterity’s
sake, even if we know ﬁill well that, after a point,
nobody will care —— including us.

This is a key insight regarding this endless
documentation. We increasingly can’t enjoy
our leisure time without making it somehow
about something more than just enjoying our
leisure time.

Everything else in our lives, after all, unilat-
erally exists to create some beneﬁt in the ﬁiture.

We go to school to improve our chances at a
good job. We go to work to improve our ﬁnan-
cial condition and improve our chances at living
comfortably. We date for sex and emotional
connections. We pray to increase our chances
of reaching salvation.

Thus, when we inevitably reach the times .

in our life that ostensibly represent the payoff,

we ﬁnd ourselves lost. The moments that we

should be enjoying, the fruit of the years of
schooling, work and relationship building, are

incomprehensible. Faced with just experiencing
a moment, we reach for our iPhones and make
even these moments a purposeful activity to
create an awesome historical record for our
mental bucket lists.

That is to say, everything must be a means to
some end. Even our fun, carefree times when,
encroached with photography equipment, be-
come nothing more than pleasure we method-
ologically catalog and anthologize.

So as the school year begins, here’s one piece
of advice to help combat this: put down the
camera. Take photojournalist Nick Danziger’s
idea and take only one picture a day.

Doing so can help take some of the purpose-
orientation out of your life — something that
we could all use. Your goal in college isn’t to

' have as many experiences as possible. The goal

isn’t to look back someday and remember each
of the 1,432 crazy things you did. Such atarget
turns your college experience into a means to
an end. V

The secret is realizing that the means is

. the end.

NO RUTS

gether and taking a short trip on a weekend.
Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia are two
of several places close enough that they’re
easy to travel to for a short amount of time,
and they’ll provide a change of pace from
Pittsburgh. For a cheap and fun wayto travel,
take Megabus to visit friends at other col-
leges in cities near Pittsburgh. Or, to bring
the spontaneity of summer into a day in the
city, get out of Oakland and see something
in a neighborhood that’s different or outside

‘ of your normal routine.

5. Learn something interesting or unusual

Summer is the ideal season to use free
time to learn a new, interesting skill —-— but
why stop there? Taking intellectual and cre-

ative spontaneity with you throughout the

year can make it feel like summer all the
time. During the school year, use space for
electives in your schedule to learn to play a

musical instrument, throw pottery or take

a class on an obscure topic.
6. Volunteer

It’s a lot easier to ﬁnd time to volunteer
during the summer. But even during the
school year, volunteering every now and
then is both incredibly helpful to the com-
munity and a major mood-booster. Helping
those who are less fortunate can be incred-
ibly helpful during moments when you feel
like the stress of midterms will overtake your
life, because volunteering can help you to
see beyond yourself. Planning to volunteer
can help you manage your time and strike a
balance between work and play — an ele-
ment which most of our falls and winters

_ could use.

Even though summer is coming to a close,
the best parts of the season don’t have to go
into hibernation. With the right mindset and
schedule, you can break out of the academic
year’s library/party/ library scene. So this
year, try to make your fall and winter a little
more like summer — tanning bed optional.

Caliban keeps rare and used books relevant

Anna Weldon
A€§J’E Editor

Whenjohn Schulman began work-
ing at The Tuckers, a used book
shop in Squirrel Hill during the
late 1970s, he didn’t foresee him-
self turning his passion for books
into a career.

Instead, Schulman attended
Pitt as an undergraduate study-
ing English Writing and later re-
turned for his graduate degree in
education, planning to become a
teacher.

“I decided I wasn’t really a
natural teacher,” Schulman said.
“I was selling used books to pay
rent.”

But today, Schulman has con-
verted his original job into a ca-
reer. He and his wife, Emily Het-
zel, co—own Caliban Book Shop,
a popular local bookstore selling
used and rare books.

Located on South Craig Street
ingoakland, Caliban Book Shop
is a local treasure that breaks
from the traditional bookstore
layout. The bookstore is an un-
likely establishment that sup-
pliesa variety of commodities.
Different from the typical modern
bookstore model that is currently
suffering under the hand of elec-
tronic reading devices, Caliban
remains true to its mission: to sell
used and rare books.

Schulman and Hetzel —
daughter of Frederick Hetzel,
the chief editor of the University
of Pittsburgh Press for 40 years
— opened the bookshop in 1991,
and today both act as co—owners.

“I married into Pittsburgh
book royalty by marrying [Fred-
éfick Hetzel’s] younger daughter,”
Schulman said.

Caliban Book Shop houses
more than 40,000 titles of rare
and used books. Selling books
about philosophy, photography
and history, among many other
topics, the bookstore has a wide
selection that encompasses a mul-
titude of interests.

Currently, Caliban Book Shop
is selling ﬁrst-edition titles of
books, such as “Slaughterhouse—
Five” by Kurt Vonnegut for $1,000

' and “On the Road” by Jack Ker— ‘
; ouac for $300. Both the store

and its patrons beneﬁt from the

' intrigue surrounding collectors’

items.

Schulman explained that if a
modern—day literary classic is ﬁrst
published after 1920, it is expect-
ed to have the dust jacket on to be
sold for its maximum value as a
collectible. Without it, the book
sells for signiﬁcantly less -— as is
the case with the ﬁrst edition of
Kerouac’s famous novel.

But that doesn’t take away
from the volumes’ intrinsic value.

“They are hot commodities.
They’re still considered rare
books,” Schulman said.

Within the bookshop also ex-
ists Desolation Row — a record
shop opened in 2004 by store
manager Kristofer Collins.

Collins, a ‘96 Pitt graduate
with a degree in religious stud-

“[Books are] still
one of the great
middle-class
collectibles.”
John Schulman

ies and American literature,
began working at Caliban Book
Shop almost a decade ago. As a

. long-time worker at the bookshop

and frequent visitor prior to his
employment, Collins has seen the
store develop and evolve over the
years. In 2004, Collins pitched the
idea for a record shop inside the
store to promote the music that
the bookshop played throughout
the day.

“I ‘turned 30 and panicked,
and thought I needed to be adult
and do something. So I opened a
record shop,” he said.

The corner that the record
shop now sits in used to be home
to a few unnoticed bookcases.
Customers tended to keep away
from this “blind spot” of books,
so the area was comically named
Desolation Row. When Collins
opened his record shop, he placed
it in this previously neglected
area, and the name of the corner
stuck with today’s record pur-
veyor. - —

The bookshop is also a member

of the Antiquarian Booksellers’
Association of America (ABAA).
Working to promote interest in

rare and antique books since ‘

1949, the ABAA is the main pro-
fessional organization of book
dealers and appraisers. The orga-
nization specializes in rare books.

Schulman has invested his time
in appraisals, as well. As an ap-
praiser for estate, legal, tax and
insurance purposes, Schulman
decided to take his gig public as
an appraiser on “Antiques Road-
show” —_a PBS television pro-
gram that takes a collection of
appraisers from leading auction
houses and independent dealers
to do appraisals of antiques and
collectibles. This summer he even
traveled to Corpus Christi, Texas,
to offer appraisals.

Through his encounters with
other antiques, Schulman has re-
alized the importance and affo_rd-
ability of collecting rare books‘.

“They’re still one of the great
middle-class collectibles,” he
said.

Unlike other collectibles — for
example, paintings — that only
produce one ﬁrst edition, which
sells for an extremely high price,
books are issued with thousands
of ﬁrst editions’. Over the years,
ﬁrst edition copies of famous
books continually pop up, ready
to be sold. Books like Kerouac’s
“On the Road” were typically pro-
duced in the thousands, Schulman
explained, and the current copy
at Caliban is one of 15 copies that
have gone through the store.

Because of the bookshop’s less
mainstream appeal, Schulman
doesn’t expect the growth of the

competitive new book business .

to have a huge impact on Caliban
Book Shop. ’ '

“It’s a different economy,” he
said.

And Collins agrees. Electronic
reading devices may affect book-
stores that sell newly published
books, but Caliban Book Shop has

" dodged this latest trend.
“The Kindle and the Nook .

haven’t really affected this end of
the book business,” Collins said.
“It’s a different side of the busi-
ness that doesn’t get as affected

Te|evision’s hit shows heated up in the summer months

Five /7z't series unleash the elnzmtz, television becomes entertainment /nzz/en this summer

The men and women at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce faced a series of changes and catastrophes in the

fifth season of “Mad Men.” MCT Campus

e~’L«The Pitt News Staff

With the variety of hit series that be-
gan and ended this summer, there
was plenty to watch when the heat
became too much to handle.

From the end of the ﬁfth season
of “Mad Men” to the beginning of
new shows such as “The News-
room” and “Political Animals,”
every hit channel seems to have
a dramalfor true television fans.

Viewers watched as Roger tripped
on LSD, Daenerys hatched the only
three dragons in Westeros and Wal-
ter White turned into a meth king.

To keep the drama in order,
we compiled a list of ourfavorite

summer shows. Here are ﬁve show
recaps from this summer that docu-
ment the emotional highs and lows

. of television_’s hit series.

“Mad Men”

The ﬁfth season of ‘AMC’s “Mad
Men” took fans of the hit series on
a winding series of plot twists and
cast changes, from Sterling Cooper
Draper Pryce dramatically losing a
partner, to LSD trips, to huge clien-
.tele deals and-to a lot of inﬁdelity.
The season began with Don
Draper and his ex-secretary—turned-
wife Megan beginning their new
life together both at home and
in the ofﬁce, which continues to

function under the predominantly A

male infrastructure. Throughout
the season, however, various social
norms begin to evo1ve,%and societal
issues such as gender and race are
addressed even more intricately
than before.

As always, each episode focused
on a character’s personal struggle
both in and outside of the office.
Over the course of the season,

viewers saw Pete cheat on his wife
and struggle with clients,_]oan and
Roger divorce their spouses, Peggy
struggle constantly with her work
and Don and Megan’s tumultu-
ous relationship, which somehow
makes its way into the ﬁrm.

But probably the most shocking
turn of events came at the end of the
season (though it was certainly fore-
shadowed throughout), when Lane
steals money from SCDP, is caught
and then commits suicide in the of-
ﬁce, leaving only a succinct suicide
note —— his resignation letter.

Taking his position as partner
at the ﬁrm is Joan, who recently
became a mother. She returned

Kevin, and after working at her.

of the season, she encountered a

reinvent college cooking

Quinn Keaney
Stcyff Writer

The realm of college cooking has long been dominated by quick and easy
staples such as powdery Easy Mac and whichever box of cereal was cheapest
that week. g_ t _

Taste buds everywhere routinely suffer the unfortunate fate of munching
on stale popcorn and last night’s leftover French fries, all because these .
options don’t put too much of a burden on the typically empty college wallet.

Never fear, though, because cooking in college has been made over from
a.m. to p.m. ' b . ' .. .

A good alternative to a run—of—the—mil1 breakfast cereal is fruit and yogurt.
Whether you’re feeling kind of fancy and want to turn basic yogurt into a '
classy parfait, or you only have a few precious minutes before your 9 a.m.
class, it’s an easy way to whip up something healthy and delicious without
requiring the use of an ovenor stove. Cut up and mix in your favorite fruit for
an extra pop of ﬂavor and, texture. '

Pittsburgh venues vary with different atmospheres and acts

Andrew Gretchko
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

As Pittsburgh continues to play an ever-
increasing role in the broader music scene,
itéccountless concert venues have been
ﬂooded by artists and fans alike.

While the idea~of being able to see some
of your favorite artists can be exciting, it
can also be a little daunting. Where do you
start? What venues are best?

Here are ﬁve venues that locals should
get to know. A

Stage AE

More than likely, this is where people’s
favorite artists will be performing. The
two-year—old concert hall located in the
shadows of Heinz Field on the North Shore
has already become a fan favorite after
hosting artists such as Childish Gambino,
Modest Mouse, Feist and Death Cab for
Cutie.

Worried about getting tickets to such in-
demand shows? With a maximum capacity
of 2,400 spectators for its indoor shows
and more than 5,500 for outdoor events,
Stage AE caters to the fans, giving them
the opportunity to watch the band they’ve

always dreamt of seeing live.
Brillobox '

For those who aren’t as interested in
mainstream music, Bloomﬁeld’s Brillobox

is one of Pittsburgh’s many popular indie _

music venues. ,

With a slew of artists the majority of us
have never heard of as well as a number of
bigger indie artists, such as Neon Indian,

Concert venues invite el /7051‘ of nets, oﬂering a variety of music for Pittsburg/7er5

Brillobox offers an intimate venue to see
up—and-coming artists perform with a kind
of passion that is often lost with big—name
artists who are ﬁlthy rich.

Throw in the added bonuses of its full
menu, stellar Sunday brunch, starving
artist’s vegetarian supper and a creative
bar, and it’s easy to see why Brillobox is
so popular with the indie crowd.

Altar Bar

. This one is as eclectic as they come.

Located in Pittsburgh’s Strip District,
the Altar Bar is a former-church—turned—
concert-venue, complete with stained glass
windows, up to 650 rowdy fans, and some
of the best local music in Pittsburgh.

Serving up a wide variety of music, rang-
ing from underground hip—hop to rock, the
Altar Bar has hosted artists such as Action
Bronson, Manchester Orchestra and Fuel,
and will play host to artists such as Big
K.R.I.T. and Neon Trees this fall.

Picture this: Latin American beats in the
background, strappy high heels and twist-
ing and turning bodies moving to the
rhythm of the syncretic combinations of
folkloric music.

This is salsa. _ ,

Salsa dancing is an intense and exhila-
rating way to spend an evening out, and in
Pittsburgh, it’s available any night of the
week. The salsa community in Pittsburgh
welcomes both those with two left feet and
those who have been dancing for years.

In the last 10 years, Loyal Martinez,
an independent dance ‘instructor in Pitts-
burgh, has seen the city’s salsa dance
community explode. Martinez began his

involvement with salsa dance in 1999 and

now teaches classes throughout the week

at a few of the many salsa events found

here. Based ' out of Absolute Ballroom, a
dance center located in the East End, Mar-
tinez not only teaches, but also attends
many of the other salsa dance socials dur-
ing the week. '

“We have a night called Absolute Sal-
sa,” Martinez said, referring to the Sunday
night class at Absolute Ballroom. “Sunday
night is targeted toward dancers that want
to learn and want to practice — and, of
course, have a good time, too.”

Editor

Today’s widely popularized form of sal-
sa music is derived from Cuba. A blend of
African beatsand Spanish guitar have de-
veloped into various forms of music, one
of which grew to include this lively form of
dance.

Salsa has people moving their waist and
hips on top of their -quickly moving feet.

DiNlNG

Dancers turn and perform difficult tricks,
making the dance not the most simple of
hobbies. v

Heidi Pullen, Martinez’s dance partner,
decided to take up salsa in Pittsburgh af-
ter ﬁrst taking a salsa class while studying
abroad in Spain.

“It was a way for me to get out and prac-

7__,.

[db

tice my Spanish with the locals,” Pull:5f_1
said. Since moving back to the U.S., she’s
found a place to take lessons and has now
been dancing for ﬁve and a half years.

She and Martinez agree that the salsa ‘

community becomes like a family for
many people, keeping them enraptured
with the dance. V _ '”"'“

“It’s not like a big sea of people that go.
It’s usually the same crowd, and you be-
come friends with these people. Everyone
embraces you and wants every new person
to learn and enjoy it. There’s like a salsa
family, and when you keep going out and
that salsa family takes you in, it’s just like a
different lifestyle,” Martinez said.

He and Pullen met at Mexico City, a bar
and restaurant located Downtown. This
venue hosts salsa nights every Wednesday
and Saturday.

~ “Mexico City attracts a lot of begili:
ners and gets them into it,” Pullen said. “It
is the big salsa party place that everyone
goes to have a good time.”

Anne Neuhaus, who has been a dancer
for most of her life, discovered salsa this
past year after a friend invited her to Mexi-
co City. The venue has become her favorite
place. ‘

This summer’s best entertainment, from London to Chicago

$3‘ The Pitt News Staff

No matter where you spent your summer
months, the increase in concerts, arts fes-
tivals and movie releases likely kept things
entertaining. Summer break always plays
H3-st to a hearty variety of pop-culture
events, and without constant homework
assignments it’s easier to take advantage
of these recreations.

Having attended events both on the
other side of the Atlantic and throughout
the nation, the Arts and Entertainment
writers of The Pitt News compiled a list of
some of their favorite summer entertain-
ment by writing about how these experi-
ences stood out from the rest. Spanning
from music festivals to Rollerblading, this
list of attractions demonstrates that your

Childish Gambino, came to Pittsburgh on
a mission. Touting a live band, Childish
made good on the promise of his Camp
tour, playing the majority of his album
Camp for fans at Stage AE, many of whom
arrived hours before the sold—out show on
June 18. - ‘

While opening act Danny Brown might
not have lived up to the audience’s expec-
tations, Childish maintained his reputa-
tion as a “mastermind” as he performed
hits such as “Freaks and Geeks” while
‘dashing back and forth across the stage.

In an attempt to challenge the longtime
hype king Busta Rhymes, Childish not only
jumped to the beat of each song, but also
rapped his lyrics directly into the faces of
crowd members. ‘

As a creative genius, Childish didn’t
disappoint, ending the show with a free-
style rap over “Rack City” and providing
sneak—peeks of some of his latest work,
which was released on the mixtape “Roy-
alty” in July.

The show’s only downside was that,
eventually, the fun had to come to an end.
When the stage went dark and the lights

crowd moaned, not yet ready to give up
hope that Childish Gambino would return

From Eastern Europe to

 
   

  & Greece, a summerabroad

Greece appears calm during economic struggles. Hope McLaughlin | Staffwriter

Hope McLaughlin
Staff Wrz'ter_

On May 26, I left the U.S. with twomonths
in Europe ahead of me. Those two months
are behind me now — I can’t get them
back no matter how hard I wish. And if
I had them back, I Wouldn’t spend them
differently. In fact, I’d do just the opposite.
There is not one moment of my travels that
Iwouldn’t relive exactly as it-had happened.

Over the course of my time abroad, I
traveled to 14 European cities in seven
different countries. _

I completed two different study abroad
programs. The ﬁrst was 'a Pitt program
new to the University this year, during
which my classmates and I studied Romani
(Gypsy). music, culture and human rights
on a three-week trip throughout central
and eastern Europe. After the program
ended, I spent time in Vienna and Buda-
pest, Hungary before arriving in Thes-
saloniki, Greece for my second program
~ six weeks at the American College of
Thessaloniki, a university in which I was
directly enrolled.

My experiences on the European con-
tinent were diverse, to say the very least. I
attended a Gypsy music festival in Prague,
entered the single former gas chamber that
remains intact at the Auschwitz concentra-
tion camp, took part in an improvisational
musical performance on stage at a punk
club in Krakow, mingled with impoverished
Gypsy families in the mountains of eastern
Slovakia, went to an opera in Vienna and
swam in the hot springs of Budapest.

Then, according to the rest _of the world,

I spent the last two—thirds of my European
adventure embracing the culture of a na-
tion in collapse.

Greece: the “imploding” nation. The
rotten troublemaker of the European
Union. Trapped in a ﬁnancial crisis that
has affected the euro severely, Greece’s
poor economic state has sparked nation-
wide civil unrest, according to the media. -

As it turns out, the media isn’t always
right. Before you ask me if I saw, heard or
participated in any riots, allow me to clear
up a few things. '

Regarding riots: there are none. Grant-
ed, I studied in Thessaloniki, located on
the Thermaic Gulf in northern Greece, so
my experience maythave been different if
I had spent my summer in Athens. Prior‘
travels to Greece with my family led me to
surmise that anything remotely related to
politics, economics and policy takes place
in Athens, and it has little to no effect on
daily life in the rest of Greece. Stu_dying
abroad in Thessaloniki meant I had zero‘
crisis—related concerns that could impact
my well-being. .

In the weeks leading up to my depar-
ture from America, I spent a lot of time on
the receiving end of the s_keptical_ eyebrow

raise. Avid followers of international news .

questioned my decision to spend six weeks
in a country that is “in turmoil.” ,
My suspicions about the location of po-
litical unrest were completely conﬁrmed.
According to people from my program who
traveled ther'e, Athens does show some
signs of unrest, with a slightly increased

Liven u college closets with
small a ditions and changes

  

Brandi Yates of Churchill is a frequent shopper at Avalon Exchange, a’ consignment

shop in Squirrel Hill. Luv Purohit |Visua| Editor

Anna Weldon
A€9°E Editor

New styles don’t always ﬁt a college budget,
and for students interested in maintaining a
personal look that coincides with the latest
fashion trends, an updated wardrobe can
cost more money than anticipated.
Fortunately, shopping smartly never goes
out of style, and there are plenty of options
for each fashionista’s college budget.
Thrift stores and secondhand shops are
the greatest sources for inexpensive cloth-
ing options. Stores such as Avalon Exchange
(in Squirrel Hill) and Goodwill (in the South
Side) are ﬁlled with great buys and stylish
clothing. Though these stores may not have
the most recent trends, they do feature a host

of vintage options that mirror current styles.

The key to thrifting is time. Shoppers will
not encounter a good deal immediately upon
entering a thrift store because of the large
quantity of clothing in these stores. Second-
hand shops typically have racks lined with

shirts, jackets and pants jammed together.

into a confusing mess. Entering into one of
these stores can be daunting at ﬁrst, and it
may seem like there is nothing worth wear-

'ing despite the many options. '

Thrifters should spend an afternoon
searching through the racks for that per-
fect outﬁt. Start at the beginning and work
diligently through each article of clothing,

, slowly examining the quality and style of

each piece. Unfortunately, because all of the
clothes have been worn previously, some
pieces may be stretched and old, leaving
them unﬁt for wearing. ' '

Also, these stores offer a lot of vintage
options whose styles reappear in current
trends. You can ﬁnd high-waisted pants,

sheer tops and great used name—brand bags
and shoes at a thrift store that cost signiﬁ-
cantly less money than they would at popular
chains. Usedclothing costs next to nothing
compared to its original price, but buyers
will still get a great look.

Another option for students on a bud-
get is to reinvent old clothes through do-
it—yourself projects. Some of the greatest
clothing options are currently in your closet,
just waiting to be altered and transformed.

Consider changing the buttons on an old
cardigan or adding a decorative ﬂower to a
plain T-shirt. Skirts and pants can be easily
revamped with hems and stitching. Shorten
full—length pants to make a contemporary
cropped look that is currently in style. V

Your small alterations to simple pieces
can make them more modern—looking while
recreating your wardrobe and enhancing
it dramatically while spending hardly any
money. Old pieces made new are the best
expansions of your closet, and though it
takes a little effort, the.ﬁnal product will be
worth the work. M 7.

If used clothing and DIY projects don’t
seem appealing, there are still many options
for budgeted shoppers; Other stores such as
Marshalls, T.j.Maxx and Ross have inexpen-
sive options from popular retailers that have
overproduced their products. There, ypu
can ﬁnd the latest styles of expensive name
brands at discounted prices. .

Shoppers frequently rely on ﬁnding their
favorite name brands in a traditional setting.
They don’t think outside of the box when it
comes to fashion, which puts a severe de:r1t

in their wallets. Shopping smartly will sagve A

you money and help to ﬁx your wardrobe,
expanding our fashion options this fall
semester. . ‘

“Breaking Bad”

@It’s been one year in the world of “Break-
ing Bad” as the AMC show starts its ﬁfth and
ﬁnal season. And the audience is watching
Walter White in horror as he fully assumes
the role of Heisenberg — the name he uses
as a meth cook.

In season one, after discovering he had
lung cancer, Walter started cooking meth in
order to establish ﬁnancial stability for his
wife and son, who suffers from cerebral palsy.
He teams up with his former high school stu-
dent, Jesse Pinkman, who only played the
%g—dealing ﬁeld a little because of the Mexi-
can cartel that runs the industry near the U.S.—
Mexico border.

In the early episodes, Walter White claimed
that he was cooking methamphetamine “for
our family” —— and audience members found
themselves rooting for him. Now in season
ﬁve, Walt is the king of the meth business
and he has hubris that was brought on by his
crafting the murder of the kingpin before him.

1t;:’s5almost~syllabus week, and we’re all just
 party before the semester of dead-
l‘@fes;md term papers. And you, of course,

 to be the guy or girl throwing the party A

 the music that’ll please both your new
aléquaintances and old friends.

 honestly, how do you know what
 cute girl with the eyebrow piercing you
Ilfljéli in Intro to Economics listens to? You
don’t, but you did invite her to the so-called
“banger” you’re throwing tonight in your

S South Oakland apartment.

Do you want to be the I person who
throws on the party mix Pandora playlist, a

T hiist who subjects‘ party guests to the nadir

of American music, also known as the Top
40?’ Or how about the hipster who throws
on the obscure music that no one has heard
about? Because, you know, that’ll really
bring people together.

§ No. You want to be the person who has
alittle bit of music for everyone, even the

, ]ager—bombing metal head in the Slayer T-

shirt.

But before we get too heavy for you hip-
sters, let’s take care of the basics.

You need a playlist that creates a natural
progression for the night, so you don’t want
the songs that people drunkenly sing along
to playing at 9:30 p.m. Thatis bad timing,
and with so many parties to choose from,
people aren’t going to stick around if the

’ music gives off the wrong vibe at-the wrong

times.

For starters, turn off shuffle. You’re bet-
ter than that.

Start your playlist with a pregaming mix.
You have at least an hour before the random
party—goers start showing up and judging

. you for your musical tastes, so take advan-
« tage of the time. »

Of course, the ﬁrst people who show up
are going to be the guys in their Walmart-
purchased band T-shirts who are super
pumped to go to their ﬁrst college party.
Make them happy with some old party fa-
vorites from a better generation — like
some Led Zeppelin, Rush or Boston. Every-
one loves Boston. '

Now the party’s growing, your guests are
feeling good and the sorority hopefuls just
walked through the door. They’ll have none
of your classic rock goodness, so appease
their minds with some chronic hits.

A The Notorious B.I.G.’s “Hypnotize,” Tu-
pac’s “California Love” and Dr. Dre’s “Nut—
hin but a ‘G’ Thang” all keep the tempo up
without prematurely sending the party into
dance mode. ,

And when your guests are past the self-
conscious stage,’ move them to the dance
ﬂoor with songs like Ludacris’ “What’s your
Fantasy” or Jay—Z and Kanye West’s “Ni**as

In Paris.” ’

“Angel of Death” by Slayer
“Mouth for War” by Pantera
“Tomado of Souls" by Megadeth
“Eyeless” by Slipknot

After a few hours of dancing, Jello shots
and overtly sexual jams, your party—go-

ers are ready to sing.]Just make sure you i

pick songs that even the most anti—social
21-year-old knows the words to, like Bon]o-
vi’s “Livin’ on a Prayer” orjourney’s “Don’t
Stop Believin’.” You can also throw in some
of those songs from the awkward middle-
school—dance days, like a catchy Blink-182
song or some Dook1'e—era Green Day.

But now you’ve reached the tricky part
of playlist creation. Your guests are close,
comfortable and singing overplayed ’80s
tunes, so how do you elevate the party from
here? Do you slow it down, giving your
guests a chance to couple up and leave‘?

No. This isyour party, and you’re show-
ing no signs of slowing down.

With the people looking for the laid—back
rap hits already departed for their inscense—
burning-friend’s house and‘ the dancing
girls off to some frat, you have only the met-
al heads and late-night drinkers to please. A

Throw on the Slayer! The guy single-

handedly killing yourjager handle has been '

burning for some West Coast thrash all
night.

And what better way to keepthe party
moshing into the darkened streets of South
Oakland than “Madhouse” by thrash gi-
ant Anthrax or “Devirgination Studies” by
death-metal monsters Whitechapel?

There is none. Party on people, and keep
off the Pandora. i

( ALBUM REVIEW

Nas returns to roots,

Andrew Gretchko
Stqff Wrz'ter

Life is "Good

,_ Nas
iébef Jam Recordings

Grade: A-
Rocks like: ‘90s Nas meets Swizz Beatz

As many aging rappers struggle to stay
relevant, Nasir Jones, more publicly
known as Nas, has remained successful
throughout his 18-year, 10-studio-album
career. The key to Nas’ continued ad-
vances in the rap game? Refusing to sell
out. ,
lNas’ newest album might include

{aplenty of the usual trumpeting of gang-

ster hardness so common in his songs,
but the recent release, Life is Good, also
features smoother tracks more akin to
those of his Golden Age past.

Yes, it’s true that Nas no longer needs
to sell drugs or tote guns to earn money,
but that doesn’t mean he can’t reminisce
on his youth, thereby providing the Nas
faithful with exactly what they want to
hear. “How could I not succumb? / How
could I not partake? / Fifteen I got a gun /

sixteen I robbed a train,” heraps in the al-
bum’s opening track, “No Introductionfi
The song takes the listener back through
Nas’ earlier years —— which included life
in the neighborhood he was raised in —
and talks with rap legend Biggie Smalls.
The album’s second track, “Loco-
Motive,” may not have the mournful key-
board or cymbal crashes of its predeces-
sor, but what it lacks in live-performance

I feel it makes up for in style. Harkening

back to the early ’9os -— rap’s Golden Age
— Nas enlists the help of producer Large
Professor, ‘a fellow Queens native, in or-
der to set things off right.

Touted as one of the best hip—hop pro-
ducers of all-time, Large Pro really deliv-
ers in Nas’ newest old—school hit, which
calls upon the sounds of the New York
City subway and a laid-back bassline to
move it forward. The dark, jazzy sound
of the piano is reminiscent of Nas’ popu-

lar 1994 song “N.Y. State of Mind” and

proves that.Nasty Nas can still ﬂow with
the best of them.

How does a big-name rapper like Nas
manage to deliver the age—old militant
ﬂow he did back in ’94? A lack of respect.
“They askin’ how he disappear and reap-
pear back on top,” he says during “Loco-
Motive,” reminding -us that detractors

only help Nas by giving
him motivation. If Nas’
beefs with Bill O’Reilly,_
Jay—Z and Mobb Deep
have taught us anything,
it’s that this rap veteran is
willing to return to war at
a moment’s notice, bring-
ing out the type of sound
that has helped him thrive
for nearly two decades.

The album’s third
song, “A Queens Sto-
ry,” makes good use of
boom—bap rimshots and
a vibrant string section
to complement Nas’ sto-
rytelling ability, which
hasn’t lost a beat. He
emulates the track’s jazzy
feel throughout the album
with songs such as “Stay”
and “Cherry Wine,” the
latter of which features late British sing-
er Amy Winehouse.

The track may detail plenty of illicit
behavior, but for a rapper with a past as
rough as Nas’, it’s no wonder that many
of his story-themed songs cover tales of
drugs, sex and violence. For those look-

ing to avoid the harsh realities of life in

takes on old persona for new album

the ghetto, tracks such as “Daughters”
are rated closer to PG-13 than R and show
the rapper’s softer side. '

He might be a platinum—record—sell—
ing hip—hop mogul, but unlike his old
crosstown enemy, ]ay—Z, he’s not pushing
forward with covers of “Forever Young.”
Nas’ latest album harkens back to true
rap. I

When the Pittsburgh Penguins’ iconic
Civic Arena was torn down, the new home
of one of the nation’s biggest hockey towns
had some pretty big shoes to ﬁll.

Luckily, the Consol Energy Center has
picked up right where the old stadium left
off, housing some of Pittsburgh’s larger-
than-life concerts while managing to juggle
the Penguins’ and the Pittsburgh Power
arena football team’s schedules on the side.
Featuring_big-name performances from
some of music’s premier players —- includ-
ing Avicii, Carrie Underwood, Rush and
Lady Gaga — Consol is the place to be for
some of the biggest shows that come to
Pittsburgh.

Honorable mentions

Since a city as large as Pittsburgh must
have far more than ﬁve concert venues,
here’s our list of honorable mentions: the
Shadow Lounge (hip-hop), the First Ni-
agara Pavilion (23,o0o—plus seats), Diesel
Club Lounge (great sound system), Club
Cafe (hipster heaven) and Heinz Hall (clas-
sical music and plays).

Bob your head, mosh, crowd surf, rock

FILM REVIEW

‘Campaign’ pokes fun at real-
life political figures

   

Kate Miltenberger
For The Pitt News

“The Campaign”

Directed by: Jay Roach

Starring: Will Ferrell, Zach Galiﬁanakis
Grade: B

It’s not sophisticated. It’s not ground-
breaking. It’s also not that far off the mark.

“The Campaign” satirically picks at
real—life politicians during an inﬂuential
time in American politics through its witty
plot and the comedic interactions between
the two main characters. W

“The Campaign” is about a congressio-
nal race in North Carolina for a House seat
that Cam Brady, played by a well—coiffed
Will Ferrell, has held for eight years, run-
ning unopposed every time. Then enters
Marty Huggins (Zach Galiﬁanakis), who
decides to run at the urgings of his politi-
cally connected father (Brian Cox) and the
evil Motch brothers, a fun-to—watch duo of
Dan Aykroyd and john Lithgow.

Brady is an incumbent more interested
in having the position rather than living
up to his responsibilities, and Huggins is
a morally sound odd-ball that gets duped
by the Motch brothers. The duo see him as
a puppet for their evil scheme to set up a
Chinese sweatshop in the United States.

For fans of Ferrell and Galiﬁanakis’s

But what redeems these blunders is
the plot, which zips along nicely as it fol-
lows the weeks leading up to the election.
There’s just enough room for the funny

‘and awkward interactions that Ferrell and

Galiﬁanakis both thrive on without any
of the uncomfortable ad-libbing that can
sometimes become tedious in other Fer-
rell ﬁlms.

Many things in this ﬁlm are implausible.

These falsehoods don’t matter though, and T

that’s part of the charm. “The Campaign”
is so over—the—top, so far from touching on
all the real issues, that it’s a pleasant re-
spite from the actual state of politics today.

The only touch of reality comes from
ﬁctional national news coverage that calls
on well—known pundits like Wolf Blitzer of
CNN’s “The Situation Room,” Chris Mat-
thews of MSNBC’s “Hardball” and Bill
Maher, among others, to warp these outra-
geous incidents into just more muck from
the campaign trail.

In these pundit-centered moments,
there’s a touch of truth when the outra-

2 geous gags are downplayed to appear as

nothing more than run-of-the-mill elec-
tion—time mud throwing. Viewers may
think during these scenes, “This would
never actually happen.” But that thought
eventually becomes, “Could this ever hap-
pen?” and adds a comic realization to the
political landscape. However, this momen-
tary reﬂection is immediately wiped away
by more insane one—up-manship out of
Ferrell and Galiﬁanakis.

trends as new bookshops do.”

But that doesn’t mean that Caliban re-_

mains in the dark ages. With more than
200,000 books in the bookshop’s ware-
house, located in Wilkinsburg, Pa., the In-
ternet has become the best place to reach
a broader market outside of Pittsburgh in
attempt to sell-more goods, ‘

Scott Silsbe, the bookstore’s warehouse
manager, works among the racks of books
ﬁve days a week. The warehouse acts as
a holding station for the surplus books
that come in and will eventually go to the
bookshop, as well as a source to document
an online inventory. Currently, the ware-
house has more than 43,000 books listed
online, which helps to expand the book-
store’s revenue. ‘

Still, Schulman notes that the Internet
does generate a few negative consequences.

e entire concept of purchasing goods
online generally isolates people, keeping
them inside their homes and separated
from in-store interaction.

“I don’t know if it’s really great as far
as promoting the idea of books,” Schul-
man said. E

And that mentality is what Caliban Book
Shop seeks to represent through its used
and rare books. Located between the cam-
puses of Pitt and Carnegie Mellon, the store
is surrounded by academia that helps to

Silsbe received his masters degree from
Pitt in 2004, and as a student he found
used book stores to be avaluable resource.

ties, it does draw from the support that -

both Pitt and CMU generate for the area,

‘ “ [Used book stores] are a safe place off

authors,” he said. “Somehow writers get

Salsa is a way to get out and make new
friends while learning about a new culture
and having fun while working out. Fortu-
nately, it doesn’t take much to get involved
in salsa.

Sunday night salsa at Absolute Ball-
room starts with an advanced class fol-

 

 

C,

in ct: 

lowed by beginner and intermediate les-
sons. After receiving instructions, dancers
are set free for a dance social to mingle and
practice their moves.

While Absolute Ballroom seems to be a
place to practice precision, there are other
options for those just wanting to get their
toes wet.

Monday salsa nights can be found
Downtown at Seviche, Tuesdays at the

Pittsburgh Dance Center in Bloomﬁeld
and Thursdays at Bossa Nova, also located
Downtown. ‘

According to Martinez, Thursday at
Bossa Nova is probably one of the biggest
salsa events of the week due to the num-
ber of people that attend consistently. He
teaches a class there with an open ﬂoor for
dancing afterward. Events like these offer
dancers different forms of salsa.

“As an instructor, I think it is important
to know all styles in case you come across a
student who wants to learn all of these dif-
ferent styles that came about. Everything
needs to be embraced and I don’t believe
that one is betterthan the other,” Martinez .
said. “It’s all about what you enjoy.”

But those who are starting with no pri-
or_experience shouldnit be afraid. T

“Even if they are off a little bit, so what?
It’s all about having a smile on your face
and making the person that you are danc-
ing with happy — and enjoying it,” Marti-
nez said. “When you hear that rhythm and
the music. is playing, it kind of moves you.
And once it moves one person, it kind of
moves the whole crowd.”

On a tight college budget, salsa is ﬁnan-
cially practical. While many other activi-
ties and workout classes cost more than a
college student can afford, these salsa les-
sons are typically free. Mexico City has a
$5 cover, but after a ﬁrst lesson or dance
social, it will be clear that the workout pro-
vided by salsa dancing is quite worth the
small price. ,

Coldplay

I saw Coldplay in concert this June
while bopping around London for the
summer (tough life, I know). While I’m

- not the biggest Coldplay fan in the world,

it’s tough not to get totally wrapped upin
the band’s shows, which are less concert
and more experiences. . -
With a 60,000-strong stadium audi-
ence waiting in the rain, Coldplay burst
onto the stage with a dazzling visual dis-
play. The show’s production value was
lavish, to say the least. Five massive cir-
cular video screens, an army of rockets
and confetti cannons, giant beach balls

, painted like the globe and blinking wrist-

bands on every‘ audience member that
ﬂashed multi-colored lights in time to
the music all played a part in transform-
ing the entire stadium into a Technicolor
light show.

Chris Martin, the band’s lead singer,
threw himself around the stage almost
giddily as the confetti cannons rained

down pastel cutouts of hearts, butter— '

ﬂies and triangles, further encouraging
the drunken Frenchman wearing a Chris
Martin mask next to me to dance his heart
out.

Still, Coldplay managed breezily to get
through its professional 100-minute set,
complete with almost two dozen songs,

additional special effects (an elaborate
laser light show) and guest appearances
(Simon Pegg of Shaun of the Dead played
harmonica).

The band opened the show with the
title track of its latest album, Mylo Xylo-
to, and quickly moved on to more popu-
lar fan—favorites such as “Yellow,” “The
Scientist” and “Viva la Vida.” Coldplay-
philes throughout the crowd were more
than satisﬁed when the band ventured
into its more obscure songbook, includ-
ing a performance of “Lovers injapan.”

« As the band closed out its performance
with a large ﬁreworks display,~I couldn-’t
help but get caught up in the moment and
dance just as exuberantly as the Chris
Martin—masked man next to me.

Bonnaroo

From June 7 to 10, the Red Hot Chili
Peppers, Phish and The Beach Boys were
hanging out at a farm in Manchester,
Tenn.

“Hanging out” may not be a good_

enough description. A p
Really, they were rocking out, along
with about 150 other artists and approxi-

mately 60,000 music fans. While the love

of music, camping and wonderful hippie
activities brought this large group togeth-
er, it was all made possible by the 11th an-
nual Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival.
Other music festivals, such as Coach-
ella, have been tainted by celebrity fash-
ion, but Bonnaroo has remained dirty
and perfectly ﬁlled with groups of ﬂower
children. By the fourth day, everyone had
a layer of dust covering their skin, giving
them a nice tan made permanent by the
consistent sweat that was inescapable af-
ter hours under a tent with hundreds of
equally dirty, equally committed fans.

“With this more urban approach, we still

The restaurant’s menu features a few

The Porch serves more-expensive food in

iMen /mng images of cars, whiskey, sports and cigizrs to Dudepins, »t/7e masculine version of Pinterest

for the start—up to announce that it recently

recruited a chief technology ofﬁcer from San .

Jose, Sohail Suleman, to help take things to
the next level. '

And just how did‘ two cross—border bros
hit on the idea? '

“Honestly —— and I’m not overexagger—
ating — we were sitting on Colin’s [a.k.a. C
Dude’s] balcony in Vancouver having Scotch
and a cigar,” K Dude explained. “We started
talking about Pinterest, and we ﬁgured out
that men really can’t use Pinterest. Well, they
can, but it’s not built for them. So we decided

to throw together something that caters to— ‘

ward dudes and men to see if it would fly.”

Catering to that dude demographic meant '

a few rules. Posting of male—oriented con?

tent (“dude stuff”) is encouraged, and “dude” '

stuff” is deﬁned at the Dudepins website as:

“something that injects enough testosterone

to tickle your sub-cockles.” .

K Dude is less oblique: “We’re strictly“

about_cars, cigars, Scotch, style, man caves,
bacon —— all the good stuff. And we don’t al-

No, dude, K Dude so did not say what you’
think he just said. He’s not hanging a “No
Girls Allowed” sign on the door of the virtual

tree fort — the site actually has several hun- ‘
‘ dred female members, which is totally A—OK I

with K Dude. What he means is that, despite

what you might expect from a man—centric, A

photo—driven social media website, images

of naked women and scantily clad. bikini ‘

bodies are verboten.

5 “We don’t allow any women or nudity be-
cause our users have told us they can’t look
at it at work if there are naked women on the

-site,” K Dude says. “And men won’t want to

look at [the site] at home if their wives think
they’re lookingn[at those kinds of sites] .” H
But that’s not 100 percent accurate,

since a quick check of- the site turned up"

some tasteful “pinned up” pictures of a tank-
topped Marisa Tomei, a bikini-bottomed
Hope Solo and’ Anne Hathaway clad in a
curve—hugging Catwoman costume. (They’ve
all somehow managed to helpfully .congre—
gate over in a category called “Hot Chicks,”
presumably to ensure no dude runs afoul of
his boss or lady friend.)

In addition to the pinboard montages,
there’s a Dudepinsblog and a-Dudepins fo-
rum, as well as a Dudepins Facebook page.

LOS AN GELES — As Will Ferrell and Zach

 Galiﬁanakis open their new movie, “The Cam-

 paign,” this weekend, they’re trying to woo a
 ﬁlm-going audience that has been voting —.

 

 

 

 

 

 

',:.a.;.’:.r-‘-z '2 :,

:5 with its feet — against comedies this season.

Nearly all of their fellow big-name come—
dians have struggled at the box ofﬁce recently.
Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller bombed with
“The Watc ” two weeks ago. Adam Sandler, as

A A close to a golden boy this comedic century has

seen, ﬂopped inJune with the gross—out father-

 son pic “That’s My Boy,” his second consecutive

disappointment after last year’s ‘flack andJill.”
Jason Segel, who has built a solid fan base with

 bromantic comedies like “I Love You, Man,”

couldn’t push “The Five—Year Engagement”

J past the $30 million mark this spring.

Instead, this year’s biggest comedy hit has
been the unlikely “Ted,” a movie whose break-
out star is a potty—mouthed virtual teddy bear.

. “Ted” has made $205 million at the domes-

tic box office, more than double the take of

“That’s My Boy,” “Engagement” and “Watch”

combined.

The results have some in Hollywood won-
dering whether there may be a ﬁ1ndamen-
tal shift taking place, away from star—driven
comedies.

American movie-goers have long had_

a love affair with comedic actors, from the
Marx Brothers and Bob Hope to “Saturday
Night Live” alumni such as Eddie Murphy and

L Sandler, ﬂocking to theaters again and again to
—~ watch these comedians do their shtick, despite
. and sometimes even because it is familiar.

But in an era when seemingly anyone can
be ﬁmny on YouTube, and when there’s an

I abundance of A-list comedians on TV and

the Web, the idea of paying money to watch
a particular big-screen comedian one more
time may be on the wane. .

“You can see a guy do impressions on Com-
edy Central oi‘ the Internet all day long now,”

 ’ said Sony Pictures Classics’s Tom Bernard, the
 V executive behind Woody Allen’s intelligentsia-

comedy hit “Midnight in Paris.” “I think ‘Mid-

‘ ‘ night’ and ‘Ted’ show people want something

smart and different when they go to a movie
theater.” '

Vincent Bruzzese, president of the motion-
picture group at Ipsos Media, an industry re-
search ﬁrm, said concept and novelty now
seem to drive the genre.

And with technology now allowing people
to share clips and ﬁmny scenes, movie-goers
who once relied on marquee names to pick
what to see are more likely to take a chance
on comedies with unknowns, he said, cit-
ing ﬁlms such as “Bridesmaids” and the ﬁrst
“Hangover.” *

“I think more people were talking about
Zach Galiﬁanakis saying the word ‘re-tard’ in

. ‘The Hangover’ than anything else in a comedy

in the last ﬁve years,” he added. “And most

. people didn’t even know who Zach Galiﬁanakis

Was when that movie came ou .”

Studios have responded by putting more ef-
fort into developing concept—driven comedies,
such as this spring’s low-budget “Project X”
(which featured norecognizable actors and
cost Warner Bros. $12 million, but brought
in $100 million worldwide) or a “Ted”—like
decision this week by Sony Pictures Animation
to develop a movie based on the wisecracking
1980s alien furball “Alf.”

Scott Stuber, who has produced numerous
comedies for Universal — including “Ted,”
Vaughn’s “The Break—Up” and “Couples Re-
trea ,” and Owen Wilson’s “You, Me and Du-
pree” — believes the landscape is shifting.

“Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller and Adam
Sandler are funny, charismatic actors and will
continue to be,” he said. “But the audience
wants new and original things. We’re all chal-
lenged by that.”

Neither of the main human stars in “Ted”
—— Mark‘ Wahlberg and Mila Kunis — are
known for comedy; they essentially played
the straight men in the ﬁlm. The “new and
original” came in the form of a stuffed toy
that simulates sex acts and acts purely on id.
If the ﬁlm did have a brand name, it wasn’t an
actor but its writer— director, Seth MacFarlane,
creator of the animated TV show “Family Guy.”

1 Are audiences playing a joke on Hollywood's comedy stars?

Other successful comedies in the last few
years have fallen into a similar category asag,
“Ted.” In 2011, the Kristen Wiig— and Judd
Apatow—guided “Bridesmaids” offered the
appeal of seeing women who were not movie
stars joking grossly then bonding sweetly, a
fresh twist on Apatow’s male—centric formula.

Meanwhile, the Jason Bateman—Charlie ,.
Day-Jason Sudeikis workplace comedy “Hor—e‘“'
rible Bosses,” another big comedy hit last
summer, also eschewed conventional ﬁlm-
comedy stars in favor of an intoxicating (if

Now, Walt’s desire to keep the meth busi-

T3.) ness going is purely ego—driven with the in-

rgp

tent to portray himself as the one with the
most power. It’s hard to decipher when he’s
being genuine.

His wife made an emotional transition
from shock at the discovery of his secret job

 to helping him launder his earnings through

a car wash to horror at her husband who she
discovers has killed people and shows no
' remorse. And Walter’s brother—in—law, who
is up off his feet after a shootout between
two Mexican cousins entwined in the cartel,
continues to fervently pursue those in the

Beginning its ﬁrst season this summer,
HBO’s “The Newsroom” works to create an
idealized show for viewers of the behind—the—

ﬁctional news channel set in New York City.

The show, created by Aaron Sorkin (“The

A MESSAGE FROM CHIEF DELANTEY

To the University of Pittsburgh community:

As a second generation police officer at the University of Pittsburgh, i am honored and proud to
serve as your Chief of Police. l started my affiliation with the University of Pittsburgh in 1972
and have seen the school’ grow and develop, not only as a student and employee, but also as a
parent. This has given me a very well-rounded view of ‘our school.

Asa parent of a Pitt graduate, observing -the University through my son's eyes as he navigated
through his academic career has given me a strong perspective of what is important to the stu-

dent body. Many of my decisions as chief are based on what's important to the students and

their parents. I understand what the concerns‘ of parents are, having also experienced the feel-
ing of a child leaving home to broaden his/her horizons. i'd like to assure all Pitt parentsthat

your child and their well-being are my top priority as acting Chief of Police.

To Pitt students, i want your college experience to be a positive and safe one. Your second home
here at Pitt will be stable and enjoyable. Our department actively meets with student groups

‘throughout the school year to maintain an open line of communication and heip you take full ad«

vantage of this great institution.

,“21]ump Street” co-director Chris Miller said,

,,referring to comedic actors who’ve been ply-
sing their trade for a long time. “He was fresh

While many dramas and action ﬁlms can
reap 60 percent or 70 percent of their overall
 revenue from overseas, American comedies
. frequently do not travel as well, adding to the
pressure on studios to contain costs and re-
examine big paydays for stars. The budget for
the star-laden “The Watch” was estimated at
nearly $70 million. “The Hangover,” in con-

. trast, whose actors were relative unknowns
 before itbecame a colossal hit, cost only about
-$35 million. (A few comedians do have inter-
national followings; Sacha Baron Cohen, for
instance, often does well abroad; his “The Dic-
tator” pulled in only $59 million inthe U.S., but

$108 million overseas.)

»+. The fading of many big comedy stars can
be seen as part of a larger trend away from
actor vehicles across genres -— consider how
the “Twilight,” “Harry Potter” and “Hunger
Games” franchises made many of their actors
into stars, instead of the other way around.

Still, studios aren’t giving up on stars en-
gtirely, and “The Campaign” is acase in point.

frigerator, under the covers and into the
nursery that the Greens thought would
never be ﬁlled. When the less—than-fear-A
ful couple searches for their intruder,
they ﬁnd a boy named Timothy, covered
in dirt and sprouting leaves from his
legs. He claims he’s “from the garden.”
The entirety of the film maintains a
strange tone that borders the ﬁne line

‘between quirky and terrifying. For some

reason, none of the movie’s charac-
ters question Timothy’s presence in the
Greens’ life, which  even aside from
the unbreakable leaves stemming from

his legs — is entirely nonsensical. He
appears quickly, immediately affecting
the lives of everyone around him, but his
arrival provokes no questions from the
otherwise overinvolved townspeople.

But such inconsistencies don’t mean
“The Odd Life of Timothy Green” is a
total loss. Though the ﬁlm is based on
an entirely unrealistic plot that tampers
with ideas of the paranormal, it strikes a
compassionate chord with the audience."

Timothy is often the object of ridicule
from his peers, getting made fun of for
his lack of athleticism or goofy persona.
But his constant positivity makes him a
likeable character who eventually wins
over some of his bullies.

Even Jim and Cindy, through all of
their obnoxious parenting, come across

‘as likeable characters. Seeking to pro-

vide the best childhood for their gar-

den child, they work hard to make hllﬁx

friends, keep him happy and love him
unconditionally. Their intense behav-
ior stems solely from the love they have
for Timothy, absolving them of many of
their faults and mistakes.

Searching to teach a valuable lesso
about acceptance and love, “The O "
Life of Timothy Green” incites a good
feeling in its viewers. But with its many
strange plot twists and wholly improb-
able premise, it still plants a few ques-
tions for audience members. I

This year’s line—up attracted fans of

‘Jéled from places as far away as France

and China to see Bon Iver croon and Ra-
diohead show off.

With such a variety of concerts to fit
in the time span of four days, the trivial
Bonnaroo dilemmas become legitimate.

3E‘=his year, fans had to choose between
seeing The Shins, Young the Giant, Fun.
or The Civil Wars, who all performed
during the same time slot.

Fans had to consider the distance be-
tween the stages and the obstacle course

that the massive crowds created while
choosing their shows and planning to fit
more than one into a single time slot.

Though I had to make some hard de-
cisions because of the overlapping con-
cert times, I had to remember that it
was rare to have this many solid artists
at one event. And what I remember most
about Bonnaroo are the moments of mu-
sic magic: Dispatch following its concert
with an announcement that its members
are getting back together, stumbling
upon a surprise performance by Feist
and running through the Avett Broth-
ers crowd to hear every banjo strum of
the last song. Because 'that’s what it’s all

':omeless population, more empty build-
irigs than we noticed in Thessaloniki and
the occasional riot. The rest of the country,
however, does not. Most of the Greeks are
‘too busy fraternizing at cafes and taverns
 to the wee hours of the morning to riot.

fghelir lack of response to the pivotal elec-
tions that took place shortly after my ar-
rival exempliﬁed many aspects of their

'€

ﬁulture quite nicely.

   
 
 

71 For example, if a foreigner set foot in

.ne,of America’s largest cities on one of
the most signiﬁcant election days in re-
cent history, it wouldn’t take the foreigner
long to recognize that it was no ordinary
Tuesday.

- This was not the case in Greece.

Thessaloniki is the second—largest city
in Greece, but if someone arrived there on
election day, oblivious to the signiﬁcance
of the day, they certainly wouldn’t ﬁgure
it out. The only abnormal behavior I saw
was one man driving down my street by
himself, holding a bullhorn up through
his open sun roof.

My Greek language arsenal did not ex-
tend far enough to catch the exact message
playing on repeat from the bullhorn, but it
sounded like some sort of repetitive chant
supporting one of the political parties.

The “protester” did not linger anywhere
long enough to disturb anyone. In fact, I
found the man who walked down my street

playing an out— of-tune accordion at 7 a.m. ,

every other morning to be far more irritat-
ing —— and he deﬁnitely had no relation to
the economic crisis. He wasn’t much of a
bother anyway — he served as an alarm
clock on school days. ‘

In the days leading up to the election, we
speculated a bit over potential outcomes
and how they might affect the country. My
RA, after spending most of his summers
and the past year in Thessaloniki, emerged
as the voice of reason. He conﬁdently as-
sured us that either Greece would remain
a part of the European Union and nothing
would change, or Greece would leave the
European Union indeﬁnitely and nothing
would change.

Here’s what happened: Greece remained
a part of the European Union, and nothing
changed. _

Contrary to popular belief, not every
Greek citizen is at fault for the country’s
pending economic crisis. The, mistakes of
certain people have undoubtedly created
some very large, very serious problems,
but those who aren’t to blame simply want
to go on with their lives.

The Greeks are extremely laid-back
but, generally speaking, they are also
ﬁrmly committed to carrying out their
responsibilities. The people do their jobs
and live their lives the same wayas they

V always have. -
Many of the stereotypes about Greeks ‘

are entirely accurate: they are loud, stub-
born and overwhelmingly ethnocentric.
They have a_rich history and they’re not

   

afraid to talk about it. But they’re also

friendly,‘ affectionate and extremely hos-

pitable. - ~ »
My mom’s side of the family is 100

percent’ Greek, so these concepts were

never foreign to me. But they do not truly
manifest in the U.S. the same way they do
in Greece. There, you can sit at a restaurant
all day if you choose. Only wantwater?
Fine..Want to stay and hang for seven hours
after ﬁnishing that water? Not a problem.
No one will ask you to leave.

And you probably wo n’t-leave. This city
truly does not sleep, unless it’s time for
afternoon siesta. Leaving to go out to a
cafe,.bar or club between the hours of 1
and 3 a.m. is commonplace.

No one gets much sleep at night. In-

stead, they catch up during the siesta quiet

hours from 3 to 5 p.m. every day. During.

siesta, all stores close and a good portion
of the population naps. Those who aren’t
napping are sitting at cafes with friends,
philosophizing and sipping frappes at their
leisure.

Drinks —- whether caffeinated, alcohol- ‘

ic or neither — are always leisurely sipped.
No slurping, no chugging. Although they
do tend to watch in fascination when they
spot Americans being Americans out at
bars.

I only barely alluded to the nature of my
previous study abroad program, on which I
was chasing Gypsies all across central and
eastern Europe. Alas, a detailed account of
my past two months would be at least the

length of a novella, if not a novel.
Given the average lifespan of a human
being, two months seems like an inconse-

quential length of time, and, in the U.S., it

often is. Why? Because we are Americans.

America is familiar. Everyone gets jadedpgfgj

some point or another.

But no amount of time spent on foreign
turf is inconsequential. Every experience
is life—changing, whether immediately
noticeable or not. Some experiences are
valuable solely because they make the trav-

eler appreciate once—overlooked aspecﬁff

of home.

I will not regret any minute of my time
spent in Europe —— or so I hope. And for
those considering studying abroad, I have
two words for you: do it. I

the rolling hills and manifold potholes

Shell skates around like a ﬁgure from the
ro1ler—derby movie “Whip It,” while I scream
while going down 10-percent—grade hills;
But this summer, it has become my goal to
master the smooth hills of the North Shore,
where we have kept our morning skate ritual.

Skating on the trail surrounding the
North Shore in the mornings reminds me of
how much I love Pittsburgh. The cityscape is
spectacular, with smooth water rushing be-
neath the bridges and the building windows
sparkling the sun’s reﬂection. There are run-
ners, walkers, bikers and people lining up
for kayaking in the rivers. It is always full of
activity.

Now that summer is coming to an end,
the Rollerblades will soon ﬁnd their desig-
nated spot in the dusty closet of my laundry
room —— my goal of conquering those hills

I still let out a little scream and occasion-

is that I am enjoying the beautiful summer

“The Dark Knight Rises”

When the ﬁnal installment of Christo-
pher Nolan’s Batman trilogy came to a dra-
matic end this July, Pittsburghers didn’t just
watch their favorite actors duke it out on
screen: They watched Heinz Field fall apart
under the football players’ feet, Mellon Insti-

tute turn into a battleground and the villain’

Bane take over their beloved city. _

But with every computer—generated hit
the city took for the sake of movie magic in
Nolan’s masterpiece, residents fell even more
in love with the rivers, bridges and buildings.
As alocal, seeing “The Dark Knight Rises”
on the big screen developed into something
more than just attending a premiere. Pitts-
burghers aren’t accustomed to seeing the fa-
miliar sights blown up in front of their faces.
Pittsburgh is not an over-ﬁlmed city, so its 15
minutes — or two hours and 45 minutes —
of fame sent audiences into a ﬁt of applause
at the sight of every familiar set.

Opening night brought the characters
off the big screen and into the theater with
many movie—goers dressed in Batman, Cat-
woman or Bane costumes. There were even
a few villains resurrected from past install-
ments, including the Joker and Two-Face.
The disguises created an energized, child-

like atmosphere that other viewers soaked

in while anticipating the ﬁlm.

But the excitement for the ﬁlm resonated
throughout the theater even without the
accompaniment of the characters. Locals
seemed especially excited to see “The Dark
Knight Rises,” and even after the lengthy
ﬁlm ended, audience members still had the
energy and enthusiasm that they had at the
beginning of the ﬁlm.

Nolan’s ﬁnal heartbeat to the Batman tril-
ogy left an impression on the world, but for
Pittsburgh, this ﬁlm was personal. I

“Game of Thrones”

, After wrapping up its second season,
“Game of Thrones” continues to reel in
viewers with its intricate plot and compel-
ling storyline.

_; Set in the ﬁctional land of Westeros, the
television series picked up where it left off
its ﬁrst season, with the Seven Kingdoms at '
war. Spanning a period of several months, the
season shows the delicately complex inner
workings of Westeros and depicts exactly
hgw intertwined each character’s storyline is.

Robb Stark, the King of the North, fought

L to gain freedom for his people and those of the

R-iverlands, whilejoffrey Baratheon continues
to hold the Iron Throne. There, he has the
support of House Lannister.

, But Stannis Baratheon, who has also made
a claim to the Iron Throne, has sought advice
from Melisandre, the priestess from the east,
and Ser Davos Seaworth. She believes Stannis
is meant for a greater ﬁxture, while Seaworth
feels uneasy about the shifting powers in Stan-
nis’ inner-circle.

Daenerys Targaryen hatched the only

' three dragons in the world, and though they

are currently vulnerable, they will develop
into horriﬁc creatures capable of demolishing
cities at her command. As another character

. seeking to claim the Iron Throne, she will

make her way to Westeros to obtain what

iv she believes is her rightful place, collecting

allies along the way.
. Each character’s story will continue to
evolve, and with tensions high in Westeros,

‘ T the third season of “Game of Thrones” will
 prove just as exciting as its predecessors.

 

 “l3olitical Animals” .

“Political Animals,” USA Network’s new

 miniseries, began its ﬁrst season this summer

during a time when Americans are especially
interested in politics —— just months before

 the 2012 presidential election.

;, Set in Washington, D.C., the show’s plot
revolves around Elaine Barrish, who currently
serves as the Secretary of State under Presi-

{ dent Paul Garcetti. Barrish —— who recently

 divorced former president and infamous
 womanizer Bud Hammond — works to es-
 tablish her own politics in a sea of deceit,
'> seandal and intense government action that
 she tactfully controls as a woman in such a
 high position.

The miniseries began with an interview

 between Barrish and journalist Susan Berg, a
'1 womanjust as equally driven as the Secretary
 of State, but by a different agenda. Sprinkled

f with a set of ﬂashbacks to Barrish’s marriage
 and previous campaign for the presidency,
 the show gives viewers a more inclusive look
1;; at the life of a ﬁctional politician.

.2 Determined to prove her role as aleader of l

 the U.S., Barrish decides to run for president

again. The election is still two years away in
the miniseries, but as a vulture in the political
realm, Barrish decides to begin her campaign
immediately, though under the radar. Her son
Douglas leads the campaign, ﬁrst attempting
to destroy it before it even begins, but then
conceding to it and accepting that his mother
would make a good president.

It’s the many similarities to real—life Amer-

ican politics that make this show compelling. '

Viewers can easily draw parallels between the
ﬁctio nal characters and politicians who have

passed through the White House and their

conﬂictsg with the media.

Though “Political Animals” isn’t near its
ﬁnale yet, a strong plot ﬁlled with relatable
characters and dramatic quality is already
making the miniseries athrilling experience.

He’s done a little bit of everything
in his Pitt football career — block
punts, make crucial tackles and

gggecover game—changing fumbles.



When he’s not making impact

plays for the Panthers, he might
as well ﬁll the water bottles, do
the team’s laundry and walk the
coach’s dog.
‘‘I guess you could call me
a ‘jack of all trades, master of
none,’” safety Andrew Taglianetti
said with a laugh.

With 77 tackles, six blocked
punts and four fumble recover-
ies in his Pitt career, the redshirt

fgjsenior has shown he‘ has a knack

for altering games with his play-
making abilities on defense and
special teams.

“I try to anticipate things and
have a feel for the game,._ and
sometimes the ball comes my
way,” he said. “I’ve been fortu-
nate the past couple years to make

some plays, but I’d say there’s a

little bit of luck, too.”

Despite the_coaching carousel
that has plagued Pitt football in
recent years, Taglianetti’s talent
and outgoing personality have
made him one of the more rec-
ognizable faces of the program
since he ﬁrst put on his blue and
gold No. 41 jersey in 2008.

So it was no surprise that
“Tags” —— as many Pitt players,
coaches and fans often refer to
him — was chosen for the an-

- nual Pitt football season tickets

advertisement, along with run-
ning back Ray Graham, defensive
tackle Aaron Donald and fellow
safety Jarred Holley.

“It’s something I take pride in,”

Taglianetti says in the commercial V
about playing for Pitt. “I love this "

University and, most of all, I love
this city.”

The Central‘Catholic High
School graduate, who helped the
school win a Pennsylvania AAAA
state football championship in
2007, said he was honored to be
selected, and also joked that the
commercial has helped him with
the ladies.

“It makes me feel important,”

., .,

 

he said with his trademark sar-
casm. “Plus, this gives the girls a
reason to like me now.”

But what a lot of Pitt fans might
not know is that Taglianetti, who
is a two —time Big East All-Academ-
ic football team selection and a
2012 Allstate AFCA Good Works
Team nominee, arguably makes

‘more impact in his community

than he does on the football ﬁeld.

As the son of former Pitts-
burgh Penguin Peter Taglianetti,
Andrew gives back to the area he
grew up in by volunteering with
the Muscular Dystrophy Associa-
tion and regularly visiting the Mel
Blount Youth Home, which helps
young males who were victims of
child abuse and neglect.

This past May, his community

_ service reached well beyond his

hometown when Taglianetti, red-
shirt sophomore fullback Mark
Giubilato and redshirt senior
tight end Hubie Graham traveled
to an orphanage in Haiti along
with more than a dozen other Pitt
student—athletes.

Chryst brings familiar

After undergoing a drastic change

self-titled “high-octane” spread
attack, the Pitt football team has
returned to.an offensive style that

offense, the Paul Chryst—led_

Panthers are returning to what

Wannstedt, who spent numer-

VVhat you missed in Pitt sports

during the summer months

Pete Blais
Staff Wrz'ter

At the end /of April, most students are
fortunate enough to travel home and en-
joy their lengthy summer break. But that
doesn’t mean Pitt sports stop when the
spring semester ends.

Some Pitt athletes are deservedly given
a break from their grueling schedules dur—p
ing the summer, but sports are never out of
the news altogether.

In case you were too busy "sleeping or
sunbathing these last few months, here’s
what you missed in the world of Pitt sports:

May 6 ——.Big East Outdoor Track and
Field Championships

Not long after summer began, the Pitt
men’s and women’s track‘ and ﬁeld teams
traveled to South Florida for the Big East
Outdoor Championships, where they ﬁn-
ished third and sixth, respectively.

At the conclusion of the three—day
competition, 14 Pitt runners received All-
Big East Honors, and several of them also
competed atboth regional and national
levels.

Seniors Jermaine Lowery and Cambrya
Jones were among the seven Panthers that
advanced to the NCAA Outdoor Champi-
onships in_early June, although none were
able to advancepast the ﬁrst round of

' heats.

The Pitt track and ﬁeld team returns to

     

action in early December with the Blue-
Gold meet, as it looks to build on last sea-
son’s success.

May 25 —- Men’s hoops transfer Trey
Zeigler declared eligible for upcoming

SCEISOI1

A V When the NCAA ruled that Trey Zei-

gler, an incoming men’s basketball trans-A

fer from Central Michigan, would be eli~
gible to play for the Panthers this season,
the news was so signiﬁcant that Pitt head
coach Jamie Dixon announced it on his
Twitter.

“Just heard from NCAA that Trey Zei-
gler will be eligible to play this year,” Dixon

' said, tweeting for the ﬁrst time in almost

three years.

Zeigler, a 6—foot—5 shooting guard,

scored more than 1,000 points at Central
Michigan, averaging 16.0 points, 6.1 re-
bounds and 2.3 assists per game in his two
years at the school. _

He will begin playing next season for
the Panthers as a junior and will have two
years of eligibility remaining.

When Malcolm Gilbert’s roommate
abruptly left the Pitt men’s basketball
team midway through the season last
year, the Panthers lost an integral piece of
their roster.

But while Khem Birch’s sudden depar-
ture left his teammates hanging, it did the
exact opposite for Gilbert — at least in a
literal sense.

That’s because when Pitt student—ath-
letes move into the dormitories on cam-
pus — Litchﬁeld Towers in the summer
and Sutherland Hall during the fall and
spring —~ they’re given the same furniture
and amenities as normal students, which
can be a minor issue for a 7-foot sopho-
more like Gilbert.

“I think they did come in and lengthen
[the bed] a few inches to give me a ‘7-foot
bed,’ but my toes still came off just a little

bit,” Gilbert said. “Before, my Achilles i

would hang off and sit on the edge of the
bed, and the wood was not very soft at
all.”

So when Birch transferred, Gilbert
took both beds and pushed them togeth-
er, forming a makeshift queen-sized bed
that he could sleep on diagonally.

While the dual mattresses were nice,

the soft—spoken Gilbert missed out on the
roommate experience during his second
semester — a big reason why he’s already
decided he’ll be living not just on campus
again this year, but with his new freshman
teammates for a second season in Suther-
land.

While it’s, not uncommon for foot-
ball players to live in Bouquet Gardens
as sophomores, most basketball players
choose to move to South Oakland, Shad -
side and other off—campus neighborhooﬁ
after their ﬁrst year.

“It’s a personal preference thing,” Gil-
bert said. “Some people like their space
and some people like to be around people
and be social.”

Knowing that his -father doesn’t want
him to live in off-campus housing until his
senior year didn’t hurt Gilbert’s decision
either. And since the University pays for
the athletes’ room and board as part of
their scholarships, Gilbert just sees living
in the dorms as one less aspect of college
life to worry about.

But as one of the more outgoing mem-
bers of the football team, it’s no surprise
that Taglianetti has taken advantage of
his upperclassman status by moving of
campus.

“You don’t get any relief at Sutherland
or Towers, so hopefully the freshmen that
have to live there [all year] bring an extra
pad or something, because those beds
aren’t very comfortable,” he said. “That’s
why I live in Shadyside.” I

Sean Corrado

{ﬁe of the greatest running backs in NFL
and Pitt football history began his Pro
Football Hall of Fame ‘induction speech
with a shocking admission.

“I was never a fan of football,” said Cur-
tis Martin, who played with the Panthers
from 1991 to 1994. ‘fl can probably count
on one hand how many football games I
have watchedover the years.” .

Without a true passion for football,
Martin understood his speech would be
something much different than what an
audience expects at the annual Hall-of

‘ "Fﬁme induction. As the last of the‘ six

inductees to speak on Aug. 4 in Canton,
Ohio, Martin left the crowd of more than
12,000 in tears. A '

“I was someone who was somewhat
forced toiplay football,” Martin recalled
as he began to open up about the obstacles
he faced as a child.

Growing up in a rough neighborhood

Martin described his close relationship
with his mother, Rochella Dixon, who

collegiate career. Then, just before the
1995 NFL Draft, Martin received a call
from then-New England Patriots coach
Bill Parcells asking if he was interested
in playing in the AFC East. Martin replied
with a stern “yes, sir,” yet almost went
back on his decision before conferring

it with his old pastor.

“I_ don’t even know that I liked football
enough to try to make a career out of it,”
Martin said, “but my pastor at the time
was a guy by the name of LeRoy Joseph.
He [said to me]: ‘Maybe football is just
something that God’s given you to do those
wonderful things you said you wanted to
do for other people.”’ '

That became Martin’s connection to
football, and, 14,101 yards later, Martin
rushed himself out of a life in a difﬁcult
neighborhood and onto the list of the
NFL’s all~time rushing leaders.

Parcells, who coached Martin with both
the Patriots and the New Yorkjets, loved
Martin for his career total of 100 touch-
downs and his durability — Martin only
missed one game in his ﬁrst seven seasons

what recently occurred in the Pittsburgh

to start this summer review with them.

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Panthers improve their games at Greentree summer league

0"

Pat McAteer
Staff Writer ,

with the conclusion of the Pittsburgh Basket-
ball Club Pro-Am Summer League onjuly 19,
Pitt fans caught their last glimpse of this year’s
men’s basketball players until late November.
PGT Trucking, a team featuring a host of
current and ﬁiture Panthers, brought home
the championship title in front of a large
crowd at the Greentree SportsPlex.
Here’s a look at the performances of a few
current and incoming Panthers who shined
during the summer league.

Lamar Patterson, redshirt junior, small
ﬁarward

There’s no denying that Patterson was the
best player throughout the summer league
season, and he is likely to be Pitt’s best scoring
option in 2012.

In nine games at Greentree, Patterson av-
eraged a league—best 23.3 points per game.
This, along with 7.3 rebounds and 5.4 assists,
helped lead PGT to the title.

By scoring in a variety of ways, Patterson
showed the same aggressiveness he displayed
last season during Pitt’s College Basketball
12

, Invitational championship run. But unlike the

regular season last year, he never hesitated
behind the 3-point line, hitting 25 3-pointers
in summer league competition.

“You never know when you’re going to have
to make a tough shot, so summer league is the

want to be able to get shots up in the flow of

shown awillingness to use his strength while

Jasper Wilson
Assistant Sports Editor

When I began watching this summer’s
London Olympics, I was drawn to the
team sports. However, I soon realized
that it wasn’t so much the team sports
aspect that attracted me, but rather the
talented athleteswhose names I already
recognized: the professionals.

The Olympic creed reads: “The most
important thing in the Olympic Games
is not to win but to take part, just as the
most important thing in life is not the
triumph but the struggle. The essential
thing is not to have conquered, but to
have fought well.”

But this romanticized idea no longer
ﬁts into the scheme of the Games, if it
ever did, which brought athletes from
204 countries to the United Kingdom
fromjuly 27 to Aug. 12.

Look no further than the conclusion
of the breathtaking semi-ﬁnal women’s

soccer match between the United States’

and Canada. The Canadians led until the
very end of the 4-3 overtime thriller, and
seeing the shared looks of emptiness on
the players’ faces, you knew that they

weren’t satisﬁed with just having com-
peted and obtained a chance to win a
bronze medal.
They wanted to beat their rivals. Tgy
wanted a shot to win a gold medal. ‘K’
The idealized Olympic Games don’t
exist. While the modern Olympics began
as an amateur competition, such a setup
doesn’t make sense now. Wrestlers and
boxers are the only amateurs who com-
pete in the games currently; everyone
else is allowed to be a professional.
Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade, who
played for the underwhelming bronze
medal team in Athens in 2004 and then
the dominant American men’s basketball
team in Beijing fours year ago, sparked
controversy when he suggested that NBA
players should get paid for competing in
the Olympics. Given his success at the
Games, you would think he knows that
Olympic athletes do receive compensa-
tion, but only if they win. I

Pitt student—athletes travel to Haitian orphanages

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

Hubie Graham recently traveled to Haiti, but
he didn’t come home with his new pair of ten-
ngshoes.

That’s because the redshirt senior tight end
on the Pitt football team gave his Nikes to a
young Haitian boy. And to Graham’s amaze-

ment, instead of putting the shoes on his feet,

the boy immediately took them to his father,
because his father had never owned a pair of
shoes.

“For having absolutely nothing, they are so
selﬂess,” Graham said of his experiences with
the Haitian people.

As part of a group led by Vince Burens, the
chief operating ofﬁcer for the Coalition for
Cmistian Outreach at Pitt, and Mark Steffey, a
campus ministerworkingwith the CCO, Graham
and 15 other Pitt student—athletes j oumeyed to
Cap—Haitien, Haiti, after spring classes ended to
volunteer for six days at a pair of orphanages in
the poverty—stricken Caribbean country.

Mark Giubilato, a redshirt sophomore line-
backer on the football team, said he was in the
car last winter with Graham when the pair got
the email asking if anyone would be interested
in going on the trip.

Giubilato said he was immediately inter-

ested, because he didn’t want to pass on the
zrw

opportunity to go and regret not going later on.

“You heara lot of ideas about this kind of
stuff, and over time it just sort of fades out like,
‘Oh, I could have done that, butI didn’t,”’ he said.
“I really wanted to take advantage of this and
I’m sure everyone else was the same.”

Sixteen Pitt athletes — three football play-
ers, three wrestlers, six women’s soccer players,
two women’s divers, one women’s swimmer and
one men’s soccer player — volunteered at the
EBAC orphanage in Cap—Haitien. The orphan-
age, which was established in 1978 by Fayette
County, Pa., natives Alice Wise and Kathy Gouk~
er, houses about 90 Haitian orphans;

The idea for the trip developed from a con-
versation that Steffey, who has worked at Pitt
for four years as a minister to student—athletes,
had with the chaplain for the Pittsburgh Pirates
and Pittsburgh Penguins.

“My relationship with Brad Henderson,
who’s the chaplain for the Pirates and Penguins
and the president for the Pittsburgh Kids Foun-
dation, is really what led to this trip,” Steffey
said. “Brad has taken many groups down to
Haiti over the years.” /

Steffey also said the timing felt right to plan
a trip of this magnitude. A

er frustrating 20 1 1 , youthful Panthers seek improved res ts

Jasper Wilson
Asszstant Sports Editor

Despite suffering through one of the worst
seasons in the programs history, the 2011,
. 'tt men’s soccer team was better than what
s atistics suggested.
At least, that’s how its members feel.
Last year, the Panthers managed only four
wins out of 18 games, ﬁnishing with a disap-
pointing record of 4-13-1 (2-7 Big East). But
even after losing ﬁve seniors at graduation,
head coach Joe Luxbacher is conﬁdent that
this year’s team will be much improved.
“We’ll be more talented than we have
been,” said Luxbacher, who has been the
head coach at Pitt since 1984.
Sophomore forward Chu Chu Onyeukwu

as it looked on paper.

“I don’t think we were really that far be-
hind,” he said. “Last year, we were just miss-
ing an ‘it’ factor or something. We kept on
losing games by one goal. [Our improvement]
will probably seem like a lot more on the
score sheet because we’ll be scoring more.”

WOMEN’S SOCCER

Panthers hoping to develop proliﬁc offense
 under new coaching staff this fall

Donnie Tasser
Staff Wrz'ter

After getting shut out 13 times last season,

e Pitt women’s soccer team has to look
no ﬁlrther than that ‘statistic to see why it
ﬁnished the 2011 campaign with a dismal
2-13-4 record (1-8-2 in the Big East).

But under new head coach Greg Miller,
who served as associate head coach for the
Ohio State Buckeyes, the Panthers hope to
rebound instead of rebuild in 2012 in order
to return to the postseason for the ﬁrst time
since 2008.

“Coach Miller is awesome,” senior for-
ward Ashley Cuba said of the new coach.

,:Qur team is a complete 180 from last year.
‘He asks more from us individually and is
always positive. Our mentality is different.

. We were down on ourselves a lot last season,

even when we won. This year we expect more
from ourselves, and we are working hard.”

She also said the team has been working
more on offensive maneuvers, which was the
team’s biggest weakness last season.

Senior goalkeeper Kristina Rioux echoed
Cuba’s statement, saying that this year’s team
has more self—conﬁdence.

“We’re completely different from last

year,” she said. “Our attitude is much bet-
ter, we’re playing much better and supporting
each other. Coach Miller is preparing us, to
win and has us focusing on this year and not
on what happened last season.”

1 Even though they were just exhibition
matches, the Panthers won more games this
past spring than they did all of last fall, open-
ing the spring season with a record of 4-0 and

Quarterback
transfers

Jasper Wilson
Assistarzt Sports Editor

Pitt’s football team is starting the season with
two players less than it intended to.

Backup quarterback Mark Myers left the pro-
gram and transferred, while offensive lineman
Juantez Hollins is suspended for the entirety of
the 2012 season and freshman wideout Chris Da-
vis sat outthe ﬁrstweek of camp for disciplinary
reasons, all according to a press release issued

by the team on Aug. 3. ,

Hollins, a redshirt junior, started seven
games last year and saw time in all 13 games
for the Panthers. _

The reason for his punishmentwas described
in the release as a violation of team policy.

Myers redshirted his freshman year and then
saw the ﬁeld sparingly under former head coach
Todd Graham. He played in four games while
completing just one of four passes for 5 yards
and punting once for 46 yards. '

The team now has three eligible quarter-
backs, given the impending transfer: starting
redshirt senior Tino Sunseri, freshman Chad
Voytik and sophomore Trey Anderson.

Redshirt sophomore Anthony Gonzalez,
who has seen time as quarterback in the past,

’ 1 has made the position switch to defensive back.

of the Year, Khaseem Greene, anchoring
a defense returning eight starters from
a 2011 campaign that saw Rutgers ﬁn-
ish with the conference’s best defense.
Five-star recruit Darius Hamilton will also
bolster ﬁrst-year head coach Kyle Flood’s
defensive unit. ‘ .

On offense, Rutgers returns seven start-
‘ers with Jawan Jamison, Jeremy Deering
and Savon Huggins anchoring a solid rush-
ing attack for the Scarlet Knights, who
ﬁnished last season with a surprising 9-4
record. _

Even with a rookie head coach in Flood,
who succeeds the NFL-bound Greg Schia—
no, and a quarterback battle between Gary
Nova and Chas Dodd, Rutgers still has a
great opportunity to win the conference
this season. In the mediocre Big_East, even
major flaws like the lack of a set quarter-
back anda new coach shouldn’t rule out
atrip to a BCS game.

Strong’s group, and Louisville’s defense
was ranked 10th in the nation against the

. run. In a conference full of strong rushing

attacks, the Cardinals will need a similarly
stingy rush defense this season to compete
for the Big East title.

Despite being chosen as the preseason
conference favorite by the media, the Car-
dinals may struggle to winthe Big«East in

a 2012 because the schedule does them no

favors. Louisville must travel to Pitt in
mid-October before ﬁnishing the regular
season at Rutgers.

 

3.0 Pittsburgh

The Pitt Panthers enter this season to
very little hype.

Following Todd Graham’s one-and-
doneseason, new head coach Paul Chryst
has brought a mellow approach that’s kept
the Panthers out of the summer headlines.

Pitt only returns 12 starters from last

year’s 6-6 team, but the Panthers still have

plenty of talent. Defensive tackle Aaron
Donald will anchor the defensive line and,
if healthy, star running back Ray Graham,
who led the nation in rushing before his
season-ending injury in Week 8 last sea-
son, will be the top returning player in

the conference.

With Graham, sophomore Isaac Bennett
and freshman Rushel Shell composing one
of the most talented groups of running
backs in the country, Chryst’s offense will
focus on the run and try to take some heat
off senior quarterback Tino Sunseri.

But the Panthers’ downfall in 2012 may

' be a lack /of depth, and barring a season

with very few injuries, the team will strug-
gle to keep up with the Big East’s top two
teams.

As the returning Pitt volleyball players take _
the court in preparation for the 2012 season,

i one of the most highly regarded recruiting :
classes in the program’s history will join ,

them. -
Prepvolleyball.com, an online volleyball
resource, gave Pitt’s incoming ﬁve-player
recruiting class an “honorable mention”
distinction in its annual report. With this
nationally recognized class, Pitt head coach
Toby Rens is excited about the upcoming
season, which starts this fall.

“This class has a winning mentality and
a competitive attitude,” Rens said. “We are
excited to have them join the Pitt family.”

All ﬁve new additions to the Pitt volleyball
program hail from the state of Illinois, where
each was named to the Chicago Tribune
All—State Team after their senior years. Jes-
sica Boddy, Casey Durham,_Ienna]acobson,
Amanda Orchard and Mary Striedl will all
become Panthers in the fall, and according

_ to Rens, each will bring unique skills to the

2012 squad.
Boddy, a 6—foot—3 middle blocker, will
be a crucial member of the team as she will’

replace the recently graduated Kiesha Leggs.
As a senior starter and captain on the 2011
team, Leggs led the team in kills and blocks
and wasnamed an All-American Honorable
Mention. I

Rens sees the potential for Boddy to ﬁll
the void left by Leggs, despite her being a
freshman.

“Jessica is a well—trained middle blocker,”
Rens said in a press release announcing the
recruiting class. “She will add depth to that
position and she has an opportunity to make
an impact early on in her career.”

Durham, Orchard and Striedl are outside
hitters who will contribute to the Panther
offensive attack, whilejacobson comes to the
team as a setter. As the setter is responsible
for dictating the pace of the offense, Rens
is conﬁdent inJacobson’s ability to lead on
the court.

“Jenna not only brings a great skill set
with her to Pitt, but also a wonderful attitude
and work ethic,” Rens said. “She has a feel
for the game and makes great decisions.”

While the abilities of the incoming class
provide optimism for the ﬁiture, the Pan-
thers will also be able to draw valuable
experience from returning players in the

MEN’S SOCCER

“We lost. to a few teams last year, and
after the game we would go into the locker
room kicking ourselves trying to work out
how we’d just lost to a side that wasn’t on the
same level as us,” Harrison said in an email.

In addition to having trouble scoring
goals in 2011, the team also struggled to
prevent opponents from ﬁnding the net and
ended the year with a 1.79 goals-against aver-

_ age — second worst in the Big East.

But the ﬁrst—year performance of now- '

sophomore goalkeeper.LeeJohnston was im-

_:;._, — pressive, under the circumstances (11 starts,
 two shutouts and a 1.32 goals-against aver-

age), and Luxbacher said he has the inside
track to a position as a starter.

When the season begins, Johnston will
have competition in the net from incoming

“ freshman Dan Lynd and senior Mark Hast.

Such competition exists for the rest of
the positions as well. .

According to Luxbacher, no player is
guaranteed any spot on the team or in the
starting lineup. The preseason roster names
30 players, but only 25 will remain at the
start of the regular season.

Making substantial progress is the goal
for the 2012 Pitt men’s soccer team, but as
a member of one of the top college soccer
conferences in the country, climbing the

standings can be difficult. ‘

Seven of the 16 Big East teams made it
to the 2011 Division I NCAA Tournament,

the largest contingent of any conference
by far. Luxbacher admitted that playing in
such an unforgiving league is a difﬁcult task
for his squad.

“It’s like Big East basketball. If you’re not
on all cylinders, things can get bad really
quickly,” he said.

One of the major hurdles to consistent
play last year that the team had to overcome
was its youth: 17 members of the 25—man
roster were underclassmen.

The spring season
provided an oppor-
tunity to gain more
experience and in-

“You need guys who
can walk the walk,

just talk about how it’s done,” Luxbacher
said. “You need leadership. It doesn’t have
to come from seniors.”

The players appear ready for the added
responsibility.

Harrison, a captain, says he’ll do all he can
to help the newcomers adjust and sees lead-
ership qualities in many of his teammates.

Onyeukwu, for one, knows he has a role
to play.

' “When the freshmen come, they’ll get up
to speed. As long as
you lead them in the

sure they’ll follow,”

With eight more incoming players this
season, the need to have a quick learning
curve won’t go away. So the burden is on
all returning players to help the newcom-
ers adapt. ~

“It’s critical. You need guys who walk the
walk, who show you how it’s done and don’t

“The lack of experience was the factor
for us not earning a tie or even a win, which
we deserved in a lot of these games,” Har-
rison said. . ' - .

In total, Pitt lost seven contests by a single
goal last fall. The ability to take points (three
for a victory and one for a draw) this season
from such games will prove crucial to the
team’s success.

‘‘[We want to be] good enough to get a
result [tie or win]. That’s the goal,” Lux-
bacher said.

J.R. Eskilson, a writer for Topdrawersoc-
cer.com, says the nature of the college game
makes predicting Pitt’s progress this yegé;
nearly impossible.

“There’s always a possibility to exceed
expectations,” Eskilson said of Pitt. “But [this
season] is just about showing improvement.
You want to see more goals scored and less
goals conceded.”

Onyeukwu attributed last season’s scorﬁ
struggles to the team’s youth.

“I think part of not scoring has a lot to
do with the youth in our team and our in-
experience,” he said. “W_hen you’re coming
in as a young player, you’re trying to make a
difference automatically because you want
to keep playing, and what that leads to is
impatience on the ﬁeld. You make a lot of
mistakes.”

He doesn’t think those issues will return
now that they have the beneﬁt of one year’s
experience. _ _ i j

“Everyone, together, we’ve got the [rigﬁj
level of conﬁdence. We know we can score,”
the sophomore forward said. “just keep

- the ball, take our time and we’ll score more

goals.“

Whatever issues plagued the team last
year, ultimately the only thing that will rem-
edy them will be victories in 2012. V

“There’s no cookbook formula [for win-
ning],” Luxbacher said. “There are no easy
games. We have to battle. We have to ﬁnd a
way to get it done.” I

Pitt’s fourth head coach in less than two
, grearsi when Graham shockingly left for

 

position, will look to reinstate a running
mindset by mimicking the power offense
‘he built during his time as offensive coordi-
nator for back-to-back Big Ten champion,
Wisconsin.

"(“We don’t apologize if we can line
up and knock the heck out of [the other
team],” Chryst said of his offensive style at
his introductory press conference. “That’s

fun.”

At Wisconsin, Chryst liked to use mul-
tiple running backs. And luckily for Pitt’s
new head coach, he not only inherits one of
the best ball carriers in the nation in senior
Ray Graham, but also has talented backups
at his disposal in sophomore Isaac Bennett

and exciting freshman Rushel Shell.
. Unlike Todd Graham’s offense last sea-

? ‘ n, the running game will be downhill
with the quarterback taking snaps from
under center and handing the ball off to
the rusher in a traditional fashion. Chryst
won’t rely on quarterback Tino Sunseri’s
running abilities to offset the running
backs, and don’t expectthe Panthers to
run muchfrom the shotgun.

We also won’t see Pitt’s offense hurry-
ing to get off as many snaps as possible, like
the team did under Graham last season.

of Chryst’s offense. “The whole tempo and
system is different, but now we’re back to
how we used tobe under Coach Wannstedt,
playing pro-style footbaliljand trying to hit
someone in the mouth?! 7 -

Wannstedt recruitedjacobson and the
other upperclassmen to play pro-style
football. This should give Chryst an ad-
vantage over Graham, vvhowas attempting
a complete change in the playing style.

Following 2011’s lackluster season, the
older Pitt players are reminding everyone

of-the success that the Panthers had under

' Wannstedt. .

“We understand what we’re expected

. to do each and every p1ay,” Sunseri said.

“Even though [Wannstedt’s and Ch-ryst’s

systems] are very similar, they are also

very different. But you can always resort

back to [what we did under Wannstedt] to
look at the success we had.”

While every coach’s offense has its own
nuances and terminology that make the
playbooks’ different, the overall theme of
Wannstedt’s and Chryst’s systems share a
common message: establish the running
game to set up the passing attack.

And.when the ball does go in the air,
targeting the tight ends will likely be a fo-
cus. Since arriving, Chryst has focused on
tight end recruiting and has already used

keep him on the sidelines at Heinz Field
through the 2016 season. Management
also ﬁred offensive coordinator Bruce Ari-
ans and tabbed former Kansas City Chiefs
head coach Todd Haley to, ﬁll the role.

In addition to the coaching change,
the Steelers added a number of young,
talented players to their roster in April’s
NFL Draft. Most'notably, first-round se-
lection David DeCastro —— a guard out of
Stanford — should contribute immedi-
ately on the offensive line.

Other draft picks who ﬁgure to see time
on the ﬁeld this season are offensive tack-
le Mike Adams from Ohio State, former
Miami (Fla.) linebacker Sean Spence and
speedy running back Chris Rainey. While
the acquisitions of DeCastro and Adams
will help protect star quarterback Ben Ro-
ethlisberger, there is still concern about
the impending loss of wide receiver Mike
Wallace, Roethlisberger’s favorite target.
Wallace, widely regarded as the fastest
receiver in the game, could not come to an
agreement on a contract extension before

knows that team captain Sidney,Crosby
signed a 12-year mega-deal with the Pen-

rest of his career at an average salary of

While Penguins fans should be excited
to have Crosby in Pittsburgh for that long,
they should be skeptical about guarantee-
ing such a long contract to a player who
has only appeared in 63 games in the last
two seasons due to concussions.

If Crosby suffers another concussion,
his hockey career will be injeopardy and

with the Jets. However, what Parcells said
he loves the most about Martin is the way
he represents professional football play-
ers. » '
“He is, I think, the poster child for what
the NFL is supposed to be,” Parcells said.
"You come into the league, maximize your
abilities, save your money, make a smooth
transition into society and then you pass
all those things on to other people.”

But Martin said none of that would’ve
happened if it weren’t for his mother.

Dixon did nothing but guide her son
to success, no matter what the cost was.
After dealing with the murder of her own
mother, she worked two jobs to support
her family, hoping that Curtis wouldn’t
live a life full of drugs and violence like
his father had. Rochella was all her son

had left and she needed to remain com-

posed in order to be there throughout his
young life.

To conclude his speech, Martin stated
that the greatest achievement in his life
was not his jets franchise records in rush-
ing yards (10,302) and touchdowns (58).
Nor was it his induction to the NFL Hall
of Fame.

“My greatest achievement in my life
was healing my mother and nurturing my
mother,” Martin said.

, After those words, the teary—eyed audi-

 

ence Stood to applaud Martin and Dixon.

Many of the fans gathered at the cer-
emony in Canton made the trip from Pitts-
burgh to celebrate the careers of Martin

Pi‘tt’s only Heisman Trophy winner, Tony
Dorsett (running back, 1973-1976).

Doleman, like Martin, said his big
football decisions were also very family-
oriented. F

The former Minnesota Vikings defen-
sive end revealed that he chose to attend
Pitt so his’ parents could come watch
his games. He had a long list of people
to thank, mentioning his own children
three times.

Doleman joined the prestigious 100-
sack club early in his career and finished
fourthon the NFL’s all-time sack list

with 150.5 tackles on the quarterback. —

He shone throughout -the 1989 season,
reaching 21 sacks —- a Vikings record at
the time.

After his long list of those he appre-
ciated, Doleman took a quick second to
think about how he had reached the po-
dium in Canton. '

“Anything you want in life, you can get
through sacks,” he concluded with a smile.

. Averaging 11.6 points and 12.4 rebounds

Without a doubt, the addition of Adams to

their game plans in order to compensate for
his size and skill in the post.

 

 
  
 

Trey Zeigler, junior, shooting guard

 

An off-season transfer from Central
Michigan University, Zeigler arrived at Pitt
as an established college basketball player.
He earned a reputation as one of the most
highly sought after players while he was a
senior in high school.

During the summer league, Zeigler showed

 

why he’s a welcome addition to Pitt’s bas-
ketball team, averaging 13.8 points and 5.8
rebounds for the league’s tournament cham-
pion, PGT.

“Trey is another playmaker for us,” Pat-
terson said of Zeigler. “He can shoot the ball
and pass it, and he works hard ——- he’s a com-
petitor.”

Although he struggled from behind the
3-point line, Zeigler constantly attacked the
basket, using his agility and size to outma-
neuver those guarding him. He also provided
solid rebounding for his position.

I A Pitt starting backcourt of Zeigler and
point guard Woodall should fare well against
Big East competition because of Woodall’s
shooting touch and Zeigler’s ability to attack
the basket on every possession.

In his three years at Pitt, the storyline with
Zanna as a player has always revolved around
his consistency. At times, he appeared to be
a power forward with athleticism and size
that wowed NBA scouts. On other occasions,
Zanna appeared raw, often struggling to con-
vert simple baskets.

But during the summer league season,
Zanna displayed a revamped offensive arsenal
that included an effective mid-range jump
shot, allowing him to average 14.6 points
per game in nine games. As an already estab-

ship and share their experience in collegiate
competition.

Zitzke said she takes the role of leader-
shipseriously, and she hopes to facilitate a
cohesive 2012 squad. ‘ ‘

“Being the setter, I know I have to be

consistent and work to make our offense
run eﬂiciently,” Zitzke said.‘ “Keeping up

‘communication on the court can help, and

it gets everyone involved.”

Another returning Panther, sophomore
outside hitterjessica Wynn, is also conﬁdent
in the team’s ability to build from 2011.

“As young players last year, we got a
taste of intense competition,” Wynn said.
“When we come back this year, we will be

hungrier and more prepared to face that '

competition.” .

That 2011 team ﬁnished with a winnin
18-15 record and, after playing in the com-
petitive Big East, earned a bid in the confer-
ence tournament. Rens believes that the
combination of new players and veterans
will be beneﬁcial to the team as it embarks
on the 2012 campaign. .

“The current players are excited for the
new recruits to join the Pitt family,” Rens
said. “We are ready to start working to-
gether.”

The Panthers will face ﬁve teams that
earned NCAA tournament bids last season,
including Big East rivals Louisville and Cin-

' cinnati. The opening match‘ of the season is .

set for Aug. 24 when the Panthers will face
George Washington in the Mortar Board
Premier Tournament hosted by Purdue.

Pitt will host its own tournament the
following weekend, and Big East confer-
ence play will begin on Sept. 22 when the
Panthers travel to Seton Hall. The team will
then return to its home, the Fitzgerald Field
House, to host the Cincinnati Bearcats on
Sept. 28. »

Following the regular season, the Fitzger-
ald Field House will also be the site of the

BREAKDOWN

due to injuries last season, to lead an
offense that only returns four starters.
With last year’s star running back Isaiah
Pead now in the NFL, the Cincinnati of-
fense loses a lot of its firepower.

However, Legaux showed flashes of
brilliance during his limited playing
time last season, and he could develop
into a great dual-threat quarterback this
season.

But if Cincinnati hopes to compete for
a championship, the defense will need
to carry the team. Seniors Drew Frey
and Maalik Bomar, who had 73 and 60
tackles, respectively, in 2011, should be
the primary stoppers for the defense._

5. South Florida

Despite low expectations, the Bulls
willhave an early chance toshoot up on
everyone’s list when they meet Rutgers
on Sept. 13.

Talented quarterback B.J. Daniels
returns to lead the Bulls after he aver-
aged 236.7 yards passingper game in
2011 — a number that was good enough
to rank him second best in the Big East
last season.

South Florida got out to a hot start
in 2011 at 4-0, but Coach Skip Holtz’s
team faltered down the stretch, ﬁnishing
with a record of 5-7. With an aggressive
linebacker corps of DeDe Lattimore, Sam
Barrington and Michael Lanaris keying
the defense, the Bulls will hope to start
and ﬁnish strong in 2012.

 

6. Syracuse

In its ﬁnal year in the Big East before
moving to the ACC along with Pitt in
2013, the Orange will look to return to

the top of the conference.

Unlike many Big East teams, Syracuse
can boast a solid and experienced of-
fensive line, but this season, Coach Doug
Marrone loses his 1,000 yard rusher
from last season, Antwon Bailey. Re-
turning quarterback Ryan Nassib and
his top two targets, seniors Alec Lemon
and Marcus Sales, provide some stabil-
ity, but with Syracuse’s youthful defense,
expect teams to put up big points against
the Orange.

While the offense is decent, it won’t be
enough to keep up with its below-average
defense, and Syracuse may miss a bowl
gamefor the second consecutive season.

7. Temple

Led by second-year head coach Steve
Addazio, the Owls rejoin the Big East
after being kicked out of the conference
in 2004. And with only nine return-
ing starters -— the lowest of any Big
East team —— don’t expect much out of

‘"“QtIC|7V 0:7 PlI?g§u‘.~

Temple this season.

Although the roster is comprised of
mostly mid-major talent, the Owls’ run-
ning back combination of Matt Brown
and Boston College-transfer Morita‘
Harris will be the team’s strength. This
team will frequently run the ball to try
and scrap out a few conference victo-
ries. And if Temple can keep Addazio
around and lure some New Jersey and
eastern Pennsylvania recruits to Philas
delphia, the Owls could develop into’ a
competitive Big,East team in the near
future.

8. Connecticut

Just two years removed from winning
the conference, the Huskies will likely
ﬁnish as the last-placed team in the-Big
East this season.

The defense returns every lineback-
er and secondary starter, but opposing
rushing attacks will beat up the defensive
line before the back seven can make an
impact. On offense, Lyle McCombs will
give second-year Coach Paul Pasqualoni
a legitimate starting running back, while
Chandler Whitmer, a junior college trans-
fer, has been named the team’s starting
quarterback heading into fall camp. He
can only improve upon Conneticut’s pass-

ing offense thatﬁnished last in the con-
ference in 2011. '

, An unfavorable schedule highlighted
by facing Rutgers and Louisville on the
road adds to the Huskies’ problems, so
this season will focus on building the
program’s future around the talented
sophomore offensive duo of McCombs
and Whitmer. I

“I think the team has adapted quite well
to the many changes we implemented last
spring,” Miller said. “There were a lot of new
things we introduced as a staff that were both
exciting and at times difﬁcult. They took it
all in stride and never complained about any
of it. At the very least, we hope what you’ll
see different from last year is a more ﬁt and
organized team that will be tougher to play.”

The team’s three captains — Rioux, senior
defender Abby Baldys and junior midﬁelder
Caroline Keefer — carry a lot of responsibili-
ties both on and off the ﬁeld. ,

“Being named captain for my senior sea-
son is great,” Rioux said. “But it comes with a
lot of added responsibility. Abby, Caroline and
I are up to it, and we want to focus on mov-
ing forward, making sure everyone is doing
their responsibilities on and off the ﬁeld and
providing leadership so we can win games.”

Coach Miller pointed out Cuba and juniors
Katie Lippert and Alyssa Meier as other play-
ers who should have a big year ahead of them.

“All have a great deal of experience on the
ﬁeld, and all had a strong spring,” he said.

Cuba leads the way offensively for the Pan-
thers. As a third-team All-Big East selection
last season, Cuba set the school’s all-time
goal—scoring mark —’21, topping the old re-
cord of 19 —— in just three years.

1 “It’s pretty awesome having the record,”
Cub’a said. “I never expected to be able to do
it in three years, and it’s nice to have it out
of the way. I can look back on that later as
a great thing, but right now it’s on the back
burner. I want to win.’’ '

Despite all of the positive changes hap-
pening to the program, Miller is not getting
ahead of himself.

“We will sit down during preseason as a
team and set some realistic goals for ourselves
after we get an idea of what we have to work
with and how ﬁt the team is,” Miller said. “I
am conﬁdent the team’s focus will be to be
more competitive, .which will hopefully trans-
late to more wins, especially in [the Big East] .”

While Miller doesn’t want his players to
forget last year, he does want them to put the
dismal year behind them and take on the new
season with a positive attitude. _

“As we have told the returning team, and

we will certainly convey it to the newcomers,‘
no one is here to dwell on the past and point -

ﬁngers,” he said. “We will have 10 new play-
ers this fall who have not experienced the
college game. This is a new team, anew year
that will share new experiences, new goals
and new objectives.” -
The Panthers will play nine non—confer—
ence games in late August and early Septem-
ber before beginning their Big East play at
home atthe Petersen Sports Complex against
Marquette on Sept. 13. ,
_With a new coach and a new attitude, the
2012 Pitt women’s soccer team will hope to
score more goals and record more wins than
it has in recent years.
“[We’re] really excited to see what kind of
product we can produce,” Miller said. I

“We’ve always been pretty close outside H
oflfootball,” Giubilato said of his relation-
ship with Taglianetti. “We’re both involved
in community service, along with Hubie
Graham. When Hubie and. Tags said they
were going to Haiti and asked ifl wanted
to come along, Iwasn’t going to miss that.”

After returning from Haiti, Taglianetti
said the trip changed the way he looks at
life. i - ‘ ' ..

“The impact we can have on their lives is
kind of minuscule. The impact on us will last ~
a lifetime,” he said. “It was tremendously
eye’-opening.” » '

Taglianetti also recently graduated with
a bachelor’s degree in business and is pursu-
ing his MBA at Pitt’s Katz Graduate School
of Business. .

After a busy summer of volunteering in‘
Haiti and starring in local commercials,
Taglianetti says he’s excited to start play-
ing football again, and he hopes his versa-
tility can help lead Pitt to the elusive Big
East title in the school’s ﬁnal season in the 5
conference. :

‘fHopefully we can win a Big Eas_t.cham- K’
pionship outright this year -—— that’s the
ultimate goal,” he said. “I think we have
what it takes with-these players and this g
coaching staff to get it done'.” A y :

Pitt’s new defensive secondary coach
Matt House said he’s looking forward to
seeing what Taglianetti can do this season
to help the Panthers win.

“I’m excited about coaching Tags,”
House said. “He deﬁnitely comes to work
every day. I just like the way he competes.
He’s a great competitor, and it’s fun to
watch.” .

Giubila-to agreed, saying that despite

, Taglianetti’s relatively small size at 5—foot-11

and 185 pounds, his ability to make game-
changing plays for Pitt at ‘Heinz Field be- _‘
gins with his incredible work ethic on the
practice ﬁeld. 
“He works his_ butt off every day, and
it shows with how many plays he makes
on defense and special teams,” Giubilato

 said. “He might not be the biggest or the

strongest guy, but he plays just as hard as
anybody in the country.” I -

‘ tions in practice.
In Wannstedt’s best season in 2009, the
Panthers had dominant tight ends Nate
 Byham and Dorin Dickerson. Both are now
f in the NFL.
With Chryst’s offense that pairs ath-
 letic tight ends with mismatched slower
_i linebackers to develop the passing game,
 current Pitt tight ends Drew Carswell and
ff Hubie Graham could see a lot of the ball
 in 2012.
As for the wide receivers, Chryst has
i instilled the concept of focusing on the
catch first before the big play, while Gra-
ham talked about impact plays and often

get yards after the catch,” said Sunseri,

whom Chryst has already named as his

; starting quarterback for this season. “They

r want to become playmakers.”

' Despite all of the talk about pro—style
and no—huddle football, one of the biggest
differences between Chryst and Graham is
the adaptability of the former. '

Graham forced a heavily pro-style group
of players to play in his hurry-up system,

' which led to numerous errors from pro-
style quarterback Sunseri, a blown 21-point
lead against Iowa and a tired defense much
of the year. ‘

~~ Chryst displayed his adaptability when

 Wisconsin added Russell Wilson as a fifth-

 year transfer last season. a
A Wilson, a mobile quarterback, came

to the Badgers in late June, giving the of-

fensive coordinator just over a month to
write up a playbook for the new quarter-
back, yet Wilson ﬂourished and developed
into an All-American and Heisman trophy
candidate. ‘

“No matter who we havehad, our of-
fense has found a way to play to p1ayer’s
strengths and not fit into a certain mold,”

 
   

 

 

Chryst said of his system’s adaptability.
“To me, a coach’s job is to put players in
positions to have success.”

Expect to see Chryst learn Sunseri’s
strengths early and build an offense ca-
tered to them, instead of forcing a huge
workload upon him.

Chryst will focus on short passes and
play—action, and with such a dangerous
running game, Pitt will run the ball until
the defense shows that it can stop it, at

which point Sunseri will sell the fake and "

look to find his receivers open down the
ﬁeld. -

“This is a great offense to be in,” fresh-
man quarterback Chad Voytik said. “It’s all
about making the right reads.” I

at Greentree ‘ ‘

As the Pitt men’s basketball program
looks to rebound from a difficult 2011-
2012 campaign, fans got a taste of what is
to come when the Pittsburgh Basketball
Club Pro—Am summer league displayed the
talents of several new Panthers.

Hundreds of fans packed into the
gymnasium at the Greentree SportsPlex
to watch Pitt’s three talked—about new-
comers, Zeigler, freshman center Steven
Adams and freshman point guard James
Robinson, play with fellow Panther and re-
turning junior_Lamar Patterson on the PGT
Trucking team.

PGT won that night, and the team fea-

’ turing four Panthers would eventually win

the summer league in dramatic fashion a
few weeks later, thanks to an overtime vic-
tory against a team stacked with Robert
Morris and Duquesne players.

june 28 - Big East basketball matchups
released ‘

When those new faces in Pitt basketball
begin playing games for the Panthers, they
will face a challenging Big East conference
schedule that includes several much—antic-
ipated home games.

That’s because when the Big East re- .

leased its conference matchup schedule
for all 15 teams, Pitt fans instantly became
excited after seeing that the Panthers
will host Connecticut, Marquette, Notre
Dame, Syracuse and Villanova this season.
Also coming to the Petersen Events Center
will be Cincinnati, DePaul, Seton Hall and
South Florida.

Each team in the conference must face
four teams twice, and Pitt will face Cin-
cinnati, DePaul, Marquette and Villanova
both at home and away this season.

Perhaps the biggest news to affect Pitt
Athletics this summer was the announce-
ment that the University and the Big East

that will allow the Panthers to join the At-
lantic Coast Conference next summer.

acuse reached to leave the Big East for the

be $2.5 million more than the $5 million

laws had Pitt waited until 2014 to exit the
conference. '

“We have appreciated and enjoyed our
membership in the Big East and wish them

they made their emotional enshrinement
speeches. ‘

Martin, who played running back at Plﬂ,%_

from 1991 to 1994 before starring on the
New England Patriots and the New York
Jets in the NFL, brought tears to the eyes
of many in attendance at the ceremony
in Canton, Ohio. In his speech, he talked

about how his mother rescued him from an , _
life of drugs and violence by forcing him to )3’

play football.
But Doleman, who dominated at de-
fensive end for the Panthers from 1981 to

season, but nobody is better suited to
g _f_'1ll Manning’s shoes than the Stanford
‘ “grad. Luck will have to use both his
voice and his talent to carry a team that
could only manage one win last season.
He is widely considered the best quar-
terback to come out of the draft since
Manning, so you won’t catch me betting

"I’7~“against him.

I see the Colts pulling off an 8-8 sea-
son, while Luck leaves some jaws on the
floor with his accuracy and demeanor.

RG3 in Washington, D.C.

August 22, 2012 7 The Pitt News I vvvvvx/.pittnevvs.com

Perhaps the biggest unknown of last
April’s draft was Robert Grifﬁn III. He
is the kind of quarterback that could ei-
ther thrive or dive in the NFL — freak-
ishly talented, unorthodox, big, athletic
and coming from a program that has
never played a top-tier college team.
Nobody will really know what‘ he has
until his number gets called on opening
day.

It’s tough to separate my fandom for
the Redskins from logical reasoning,
but this kid has impressed everyone
who has seen him, and I won’t be the
first doubter. It might not be Cam New-
ton-esque, but “RG3” will get it done in

his rookie season, and other.” teams in
the NFC East are not going to enjoy hav-
ing to chase him and Eagles quarterback

Mike Vick around week after week.‘

if this team actually looked as good on

The San Francisco 49ers have more

they did more in the offseason than any-
one and they were one game away from
the Super Bowl last year. This could be
their year.

Dream Team tries to fall asleep 8

l

The hype around the Eagles last year

was not entirely their fault, but it was ‘

entirely their fault that they only man-
aged eight wins. Vick followed my rant
on his contract being outrageous 
proving (once again) that he can’t com-
plete a full NFL season without suffer-
ing an injury.

Still, the “Dream Team” hype lingers

and the birds are doing everything they,

can to get where they know they can be:
the Super Bowl. The signing of DeMecg

_ Ryans was big for a line-backing groiip

thatleaks like a South Oakland faucet;
but he_, like Vick, still needs to prove he
can stay healthy. ° .

Bucs as a Dark Horse

Nobody is talking about Tampa Bay,
and I’m not sure why.-The Buccaneers
signed wide receiver Vincent Jackson,
who may have been the biggest sure
thing in free agency this year. They also
picked up veterans like Carl Nicks and
Dallas Clark and got rid of the cancer
that is Albert Haynesworth. 4:

They also have Josh Freeman, a quar-

terback who had a 25 to 6 touchdown-

to-interception ratio in his rookie;
season before plummeting for myriad

_ reasons, and they seem to have ad-}

dressed most of those reasons. 
from the Saints, they play in a pretty
weak division. And with New Orleans in
shambles, this could be the year Tampa,

New Orleans gets impaled

 Speaking of New Orleans, nothing
like what happened to the Saints this
offseason has ‘ever happened in the
NFL, and it might never happen again.

The Saints lost their defensive coor-
- » dinator, their coach was suspended for
the entire season and four of their best
players will have to serve suspensions
in the wake of “bounty gate” -—— a scan-
dal that revealed that Saints players and
coaches had been putting bounties on
opposing players in an attempt to injure
them. N

But the Saints’ problems don’t stop '

there. They lost Carl Nicks to a team in
their division, star quarterback Drew
Brees hadcontract disputes this sum-
rner and the team was supposed to have
a down year anyway. New Orleans could
be in for a depressing season on the
gridiron. ‘

than one month prior to the Games. This
time, Murray won with relative ease,
sending a nation craving a legitimate
tennis star into a frenzy.

However, American Serena Williams
put that celebration to shame. After
winning her women’s tennis gold medal
match against Maria Sharapova of Russia
in dominating fashion, the Compton, Ca-
lif., native performed a dance move that
originated in her hometown called the
“crip walk” to the pleasure of the British
crowd. '

The victory completed the “golden
slam” for Williams, meaning she had won
all four major tournaments (the Austra-
lian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon

and the U.S. Open) and an Olympic gold
medal.

Even if they are professionals, such
emotion from both Murray and Williams
reaffirms how important the Olympics

' are -‘to these athletes. It’s not just anoth-

er title to add to the collection — it is a
unique distinction that can only be won
every four years.

In women’s soccer, 70,584 fans saw
team Great Britain face Brazil at the fa-
mous Wembley Stadium in a group—stage
contest, making it the largest crowd to
ever see a women’s soccer game in the
United Kingdom and the third largest
ever in history. '

participated with the exception of three
over-age players. Despite the relative
youth of the under-23 players, all of
them earn money for professional sides,
and because of the high level of play, the
tournament drew about 1.5 million spec-
tators over the 30 ‘matches before Mexi-

‘ co eventually won gold.

Professional athletes competing in
the Olympics began only recently, when
the United States men’s basketball team
validated the International Olympic
Committee’s (IOC) decision to allow pro-
fessionals at the Games in 1992. Dubbed
the “Dream Team” because of its aston-
ishing collection of talent (11 Hall of
Famers), that team’s performance at the
Games in Barcelona deserves much of
the credit for the subsequent growth of
basketball internationally. And growing
sports across the world has always been
one of the overarching goals of the Olyrrf-
pics. ’ 

Ice hockey at the Winter Games is a
comparable sport, as since 1998 it has
become the domain of professionals. As
a result, no event at the Winter Olympics
is more anticipated than the men’s ice
hockey ﬁnal. '

It’s been 20 years since profession’-
als ﬁrst competed at the world’s biggest
sporting event, and if the IOC knows

’ what a vital role these professionals have

in making the games everlastingly rel-

’ evant, it will do everything in its power

to keep from losing the pros. If the Olym-
pics were comprised of all amateurs,
there would be way too many Olympians

O just happy to be there, and the level of

competition and entertainment would
drop signiﬁcantly. ~
After all, when we tune in every four

years to watch the very best athletes in

the world compete, we want to know that
they’ are indeed the very best athletes in
the world.‘
