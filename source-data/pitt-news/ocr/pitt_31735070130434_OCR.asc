. Maybe Holland Hall really ishaunted. But not by
ghosts or ghouls. » «

The asbestos that has left trash rooms in Holland
scaled up now has forced University officials to cancel
Haunted Holland, the popular haunted house 11111 by the

A Resident Student Association for Halloween.

‘ And the building’s jinx is ongoing. Now, some
Holland residents will be restricted from using some of
their bathrooms, too. '

A sign posted on the door of the south wing’s
entrance at the end of last week warns students that the
bathrooms on the south side of the second, third, ‘sixth,
eighth and ninth ﬂoors will be closed “to have various
valves abated” on Monday and Tuesday from .10 a.m
until 6 p.m. ' ‘

The residents have been asked to use bathrooms on
the north side of the building.

Abatement, the process of removing asbestos, is
also the cause for the temporary closing of Haunted
Holland. Work is being done in both the basement and
sub-basement of the building which makes it impossible

 Ho||andHal|’s asbestos halts haunted house

to use the route for the haunted house, according to

Denine Rocco, interim director of Residence Life.
Sometime around the beginning of October,

Holland Hall Resident Director Laurel Johnson called

’ Rocco in order to get a trunk full of costumes and props

for the event. She then learned that event would be can-
celled. ,
According to Johnson, a new event will ﬁll in for
Haunted Holland, which has a 20-year tradition.
‘We’re calling it ‘Nightmare in the Quad,”’ she
said. The Oct. 26 event will feature games and pumpkin
decorating in the Schenley Quadrangle from .7 to 10
p.m., and then willmove to the Pitt Club until midnight.
But Rocco insists that Haunted Holland will return.
-“It’s really been an event that we’ve enjoyed putting
on,” she said. “We’ll bring it back next year, no doubt.”
In light of all of the abatements in Holland Hall,
Don Horrigan, the asbestos inspector supervisor from
the Allegheny Department of Health who is overseeing
the abatements, said that informational meetings will be
held in the future to address any community concerns.

' “Me or one of my inspectors will attend the meet-
ings before work starts,” he said. “It will explain how
the area will be set up. And at the same time, it will help
me, if somebody sees something out of the ordinary.”

The work in the trash rooms, which is supposed to
conclude. in the middle of this week, is centered around
the insulation of steam pipes that run vertically through
the building. 2

Larry Keller, the director of environmental health
and safety, said the ﬁrst step in the process was to deter-
mine the pipe’s insulation was made out of asbestos,

_ which is hard to differentiate from ﬁberglass.

“Sometimes, you can’t even tell what’s asbestos and
what’s‘ not, even under a microscope,” he said.

He said that" the pipes were encapsulated in an
attempt to prevent the asbestos from breaking off,
enough times to warrant abatement. . _

Horrigan said that any other abatements taking
place on campus are removing levels of asbestos less

than the limit imposed by the Allegheny County .

Department of Health. ’

Horrigan also said that Pitt is doing all it is supposed in

to do with regards to warning students.

“[Pitt] is not required to do anything beyond posting
the signs,” he said, speaking of the warning signs glued
on protective plastic sheets that enclose the trash rooms.

Harry Burner, director of housing, did not return
phone messages left by The Pitt News over a period of
ﬁve days.

Pittsburgh Project c

Oakland is a cleaner place now
that hundreds of Pitt volunteers are
finished with it.

Volunteers for the sixth annual
Pittsburgh Project successfully
combed the streets picking up trash
Saturday, illustrating this year’s
theme, “Yinz pitch in.”

Armed with trash bags, gloves,
Oakland maps and first aid kits, 27
groups of volunteers started from
Posvar Hall at noon and were
assigned to clean up Shadyside,
Baum Boulevard, Boulevard of the
Allies, North Oakland and other
areas. Each group had a crew leader
to help guide and motivate its mem-
bers. .

More motivation came from the
free T-shirts and food afterward.

This year’s project, which has
been in the planning stages since
the summer, was run by the Student
Government Board Community
Relations and Environmental com-
mittees and the Student Volunteer
Outreach. Planning for the event
included getting catered food cour-
tesy of Pitt, hiring DJ “Digital”
Dave Lander for entertainment after

received free T-shirts that they had
to wear during the day.

Although the approval for this
year’s of the T-shirts hit some
obstacles, everything was resolved
in time.

“It basically took a lot’ of team-
work,” said senior Neha Patel, co-
chair of the Community Relations
Committee and of the Pittsburgh
Project.

Registration signs and posters
advertised the ‘event, the commit-
tees’ members also spent the last
few weeks actively recruiting‘vol—
unteers around campus and at the
volunteer fair. More than 500. stu-
dents signed up.

“It was great to see everyone
wanting to take time out of their
busy schedules to work as a team
and clean up Oakland,” Patel said.

The Environmental Committee,
which was just reinstated last
spring after a hiatus, wanted to get
involved in the school’s activities
as quickly as possible.

“We thought this would be a
great event to get involved in to get
started this year,” said sophomore

“It’s great that everyone wants

couldn’t have had a better day for
it.”

Other Pitt organizations made
the project a success “as well. The 15

to advertise its presence on campus.

“We are trying to get the fresh-
men aware of what’s around,”

. Culliton said.

Gray and Culliton have also
volunteered in the .Adopt-a-
Highway program and at children’s
hospitals respectively. Although the
turnout was not what the project
was expecting, the volunteers felt
like they had accomplished some-
thing after the day was over.

“We accomplished a lot with the

people that did come,” Graysaid. “I
did something that really made a
difference.”_

“We take a lot of pride_in this
University,” said Community

“This was a great way to show our
Pitt Pride.”

On Oct. 11, Pitt sponsored “Get
Out-Stay Out,” an informative exhibit
about fire prevention and safety on the
William Pitt Union lawn.

This week is Fire Prevention Week,
and in light of the recent arson ﬁre on
North Oakland, the exhibit was more
important than normal. The exhibits
were a mixture of informative games
and real-life examples about how close-
ly ﬁre can hit home. Pamphlets were
given out to on-campus students outlin-
ing firc prevention techniques in the
dorms and info about what devices are
allowed in Pitt’s dorm rooms. -

Off campus students were given
free batteries for fire alarms and were
asked to ﬁll out a form about their off-
campus housing experience. Those who
send in the form will receive afree ﬁre
alarm. Since ﬁre is so unpredictable,
Larry Keller, director of environmental
and health safety, said, every home
should have two ﬁre escape routes and
should practice escape routines regular-
13/

Students were asked to try to use a

fire extinguisher to put out a fire.

According to Rick Schultz, safety and
training manager at Pitt, many people
do not know how to use a ﬁre extin-
guisher.

A technique called PASS, an’

acronym for pull the pin, aim at the
base of the ﬁre, squeeze the handle and
sweep from side to side, is the best
technique to use. While most students
succeeded in putting out the. ﬁre, some
were unable to extinguish the con-
trolled blaze at the event.

“If you’ve never used a ﬁre extin-_
guisher, you may not be ready for the
noise or the feeling of [carbon dioxide]
coming out,” Keller said.

At another table, remnants of dorm
ﬁres, a melted stereo from Tower C, a
charred microwave from Sutherland
Hall and a burnt fan from a fraternity
house were some of the items on dis-
play. Keller said ﬁre is one of the
biggest problems on college campuses.

“In the last 10 years, 38 students
have died and since January of this
year, 12 around the country have died,”
Keller said.

Keller said when aﬁre occurs, the
ﬁre is not what normally kills people,
usually the person becomes so disori-
ented they don’t know where to go.
Students were invited to take a walk
through a smoke tunnel to see how dif-
ficult it is to get out of a smoky room.

“That was cool, you couldn’t see
two feet in front of you and it wasn’t

even black smoke, it was whitc,”. said ‘

Ashley ‘ Peters, a .freshman from
Sutherland Hall. “ S

A video booth showed three videos,
each video dealing with a different

aspect of fire‘ destruction. The first s

video showed a studcnt’s whose acade-
mic carccrwas almost destroyed after a
fire in his building; an aspect of ﬁre

’ destruction typically not thought about.

The second video was more people-
oriented and it spoke about the victims
and the families in a fraternity house

‘fire at North Carolina University. The

third video, made at Middlebury
University, showed that it takes only
three minutes for ﬁre to completely
engulf a dorm room. .

“Seems like every year we have
one major ﬁre,” Schultz said. i .

-Since 1992, the University ha
done a ﬁre ‘ awareness exhibit during
Fire Prevention Week to keep students
aware ‘of the hazards of ﬁre and what to
do in case of a ﬁre.

“It’s very good for awareness, espe-
cially with what’s been going on,”
Peters said.

A haunting

TAMARA SIMPSON

Staff Writer

The room is silent. A full moon shines
through the old windows of the Early
American Room. It is 11:45 p.m., on
Friday the 13th 2000, and I lie sleeping on
the wooden ﬂoor of the upstairs bedroom.

Suddenly, I wake up to a chilly blast
of air. It is so cold that I am shivering. Not
certain of what exactly woke me up, I
open my eyes, and as quickly as it came,
the cold air is gone. To my left, Maxine
Bruhns lays only three feet away, and says
somehow she did not feel the same chill
that I did. .

My experience in the Early American
Room was not the ﬁrst of its kind.

The room consists of a living area and
a secret passage that leads to a bedroom.
Before we fell asleep Friday, Director of
the Nationality Rooms Maxine Bruhns
told the other reported stories occurring in
328, the Cathedral of Learning.

The first alleged haunting happened
to custodian John Carter.

, Bruhns said as he was “straightening
the bed,” he leaned under the rope that
kept visitors out.

“He heard a movement,” she said,
“and he turned around. The bed had been
turned down, and there was an indentation
in the pillow as if someone had lain there.”

That was not the only occurrence that
Carter reported. Another time, he entered
the room and a few decorative ears of com
had fallen. There were kernels all over the
ﬂoor, and although he wondered how they

 

night inthe arly American Room

could have fallen off of an inch-long nail,
he cleaned them anyway. After carefully
replacing the corn on the nail, he left the
room to ﬁnish his rounds.

The next day, he entered the Early
American Room and once again, there
were com kernels all over the ﬂoor. He
cleaned them once again, and that was the
last of the mysterious corn fallings.

“Sometime later, one of our guides
walked in here with a group and every-
body smelled freshly baked bread,”
Bruhns continued. _She said there was no
bread in the fireplace, and -there was no
bread in the hall. v.

“That was a big mystery,” she said.-

“Another guide carne upto the room
with a group, and the baby cradle had been
moved and was rocking slightly,” Bruhns
said.

Many people outside of the
University soon heard of the haunted
Nationality Room, and became interested
in viewing it for themselves.

Charmel 11 ﬁlmed ‘a special there on
the “Ghosts of Pittsburgh.” The same
channel later spent Halloween night in the
Early American Room.

“I gave them a key to the door and
told them how to operate the secret latc ,”
Bruhns said. “The broadcaster, the pro-
ducer and the videographer went in that
closet and somehow the door closed and
latched behind them, locking them in.”
The-reporters were forced to look through
a crack in the door and lift the latch with a
credit card. '

Later that same night, two women
from Channel -11 decided to leave to get
something to eat,
and were trapped in
an elevator when the
lights went out and

the elevator stopped.
’ Security had to
rescue the women.

Bruhns stayed
in the room with the
crew until almost 5
a.m. “I just put my
sleeping bag up
there and went to
sleep,” she said‘.
“When I woke up , I

felt somebody was in my sleeping bag.

with me. It was very warm.” Bruhns
remembered sharing a bed with her grand-
parents when she would stay overnight
with them as a child.

“They would let me sleep ir1 their bed

between them when it was really cold. It ‘

was a good feeling. I just sort of felt that

. my grandmother was there, but I can’t-

prove that,” she said.

Bruhns believes her grandmother
may be the ghost of the Early American
Room because it wasn’t until her wedding
quilt was added to the display there that
strange things started happening.

Bruhns always wears her grandmoth-
er’s wedding ring and decided to give her
another chance to appear on her grandpar-
ents wedding anniversary. On Feb. 28,
Bruhns went up to the Early American
Room and bedded down on the bedroom
ﬂoor. Just when she was about to drift off
to sleep, she heard movement above her
head. After a little rustling,‘ she heard
something fall right beside her head. She
reached for her ﬂashlight and found that

her water bottle had fallen from the chair '

onto the ﬂoor right next to her head.

. To make the bedroom appear to be
occupied, Bruhns put a photo of her
grandmother, her grandfather’s glasses

and his Bible in the bedroom. .

One psychic supports Bruhns theory
about the ghost being her grandmother.
Oncehe stood in the bedroom, he said that
there was a woman there. He claimed she '
was wearing an apron and described her to
be exactly like Bruhns’ grandmother,
Brulms said. '

Brulms said thatwhen a spirit passes
by, it is usually accompanied by a cold

gust of air. That cold gust of air was the

only presence felt that night.
My incident occurred upstairs, but
downstairs Bruhns felt a gust of air also.

2 The candle in 328 Cathedral of
Learning was burning very low. Suddenly,
the ﬂame blazed up as if a burst of oxygeri
came into the room. The ﬂame then settled
to its original low. _ _ .

Could it be a coincidence that the cra-
dle was rocking when the guide brought in
her group? Perhaps a window was open
allowing the scent of freshly baked bread.
to enter the room. Did those that experi-
enced, weird occurrences in the Early

American Room fabricate their stories? Or . A

is there really something weird going on
inside this small suite in the Cathedral of
Learning?

The experience of this Friday the 13th
has made me a believer.

Each participant paid a $15 fee to
enter the race, which is donated directly
to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

Bob Cole, father of Lambda Chit

Alpha president Jason Cole, placed 18th
in last year’s race. This year his goal was
to beat everyone in his son’s fraternity.
“It’s a full moon on a Friday night,
what more could you ask for,” Cole
asked.
Joel Feltz, Pi Kappa Alpha member

and runner, liked this year’s race condi-
tions.

“It’s not too cold and it’s not early in
the moming,” Feltz said.

Last year’s Campus Classic was held
on a Saturday morning, and weather con-
ditions weren’t favorable.

in the Flot.

Ricki Martin’s “She Bangs” sent I'llIl-
ners on their way. About 15 minutes later
Lander got walkers walking to “Rapper’s

‘ Delight.” , .

It took only 20 minutes for runners to

circle back to the parking lot. After pass-
ing the large clock that displayed their
ﬁnishing time, runners bent over to catch
their breaths.

Sigma Sigma Sigma member Kathy
Graham gulped down a bottle of
Aquaﬁna after a hard race. She thought
the race was “way too hilly.”

Cole took a short walk to catch his
breath after ﬁnishing the race.

“It was fun, although I didn’t like the
down hills,” he said.

The parking lot began to ﬁll up again
with exhausted runners and seemingly
more energetic walkers. A group of soror-

ity sisters who walked in the race danced
to ‘N Sync's “Bye Bye Bye.”

More pizza arrived from Cumpie’sI
and hungry participants raced to grab a
slice. ‘ \

' As the pizza disappeared, so did the

participants. Many headed up to Trees a’
Hall for the armouncement of the race’s '

winners and Pitt basketba1l’s Midnight
Madness event. I

Torok said he was happy with the
outcome of the event.

“It was a success, I think students
and other participants really ‘enjoyed
themselves,” he said.

 OPINIONS

A EDITORIAL  

University’s attitude toward
asbestos magnifies anxiety

Ignorance is not always bliss, espe-

cially with regard to matters of health .

and safety. Apparently not realizing

‘this, the University has chosen to take a

covert approach to the asbestos
removal currently taking place in
Holland Hall, rather than being Open
and up front with students. ‘_

. The potentially fatal effects that
asbestos can have on one’s health are

, widely publicized and even sensation-

ahzed in our generation. Consequently,
“asbestos” is a loaded word for many
students and people our age —— one that
easily inspires fear and panic.

In reality, asbestos is dangerous,
but only when the ﬁbers become air-
borne are inhaled. It is a very common
insulate, especially in older buildings,
and it can be safely removed.

The best way for the University to .
1- . ease students’ minds about the asbestos
problem is to emphasize such facts and A

educate people! about the issue. Fear

' springs from both genuine threat and
lack of knowledge; the more you

understand a particular problem, the
less likely you are to worry irrationally
about it.

I =-Unforurnately, the University has
not espoused such a direct and honest
approach. When students in Holland
Hall awoke one morning last week to
ﬁnd their trash rooms sealed off, with
signs reading “Danger. Asbestos.

Cancer and lung hazard,” it is likely
that they were surprised and appropri-
ately concerned.

Other signs posted in the halls stat-
ing that there would be “men working
on various ﬂoors” and that the water
would be shut off may or may not have
been in reference to asbestos removal
and only increased ﬂie ambiguity sur-
rounding the matter.

Dealing with the situation so
sneakily — not directly warning stu-
dents ahead of time about abatements
and failing to inform them about the
overall process, every step along the
Way ~ is what stimulates the growth
of an asbestos anxiety practically
inborn among many. The University
administration’s unwillingness to dis-
cuss the issue will do noﬂiing to allevi-
ate students’ concerns and is irresponsi-
ble and negligent of their duties.

It is also disturbing that the
University can discover asbestos in a

‘residence hall so seemingly suddenly.

Why isn’t Pitt checking the safety of all
buildings in the beginning of the sum-
mer, so that abatements in residence

halls could take place when no one is

living in them? Shouldn’t they know
where every instance of asbestos is?

With regard’ to asbestos, the
University provides few solid facts and
a lot of unanswered questions. We can-
not help but worry.

Open your mind with music

Tell me if I’m wrong: in your hometown,
you and your high school friends complained that
there was nothing to do, except maybe go to Eat
‘NParkat2a.m. and, afterthat, gotoWal-Mart
to mess with as much merchandise as possible.

Alﬂrough you were sad to leave your high
school friends, you were happy to be moving to
Pittsburgh, where ﬁnally you would have “some-
ﬂring to do”. Whether this is your ﬁrst year_or

, you’ve been here for three already, you were at

some point excited about coming to Pittsburgh.

So now that you’re here, what do you do?.

The exact same thing — complain. You may say,‘
“There’s nothing to do in Oakland,” “'Ihere’s
nowhere to go,” “This place sucks.” At this point
I could try to inﬂuence you to attend ‘

. the opera, ballet, symphony or any of TRISH A

the various museums in Pittsburgh.

But I won’t. Although all of
these culturally enriching events are
wonderful, I’m talking about going .
to see some live music that will knock you on
your complaining rump. Believe it or not, there
are several venues, such as the Beehive and Club
Laga, located within walking distance of campus.
Many shows are 18 and _over and priced for ﬁnan-
cially impaired college students.

Two shows that I attended several weekends
ago at the Beehive Theater got me thinking about
this. Between these two shows, I saw Fungus,
Left for Dead, Jhinx, One World Tribe and
Schleigho (I’m doing a little plug for these bands
because they were all awesome). If you’re the
type who needs to put everything into categories,
these‘could be classiﬁed as “hippie” bands.

Now, maybe hearing this turns you off. You
don’t like “hippie” music. Well, you probably like
guitar, bass, drums and vocals, and when you
break it down, these bands consist of that Open
yourself up to music to which you don’t normal-
ly listen -_-— you’ll ﬁnd a whole new crowd with
diiferent interests and perspectives, musical and
otherwise. Maybe you’ll end up opening new
doors of both musical interest and ﬁiendship.

Picture this: although you’re self-conscious
about dancing and singing along in front of so

many unfamiliar faces standing with you on the
hard, cement ﬂoor, you know you really want to.
The music feels good to you. If you were in your
room by yourself, you’d certainly be dancing by
now. You begin by tapping your foot and scan-.
ning the room to see how other people are con-
ducting themselves. Everyone seems like they are
holding back too; if only this roomful of people
could break the social boundaries!

At about the halfway point in the show, you
and almost everyone else give in to the pounding
of the drums, guitars and bass jamming out You

have to, because the music really seems to get

into everyone and gives you no choice but to
move to the music in Whatever.way you see ﬁt.

at the Beehive on those two nights. I
had‘ to smile when I saw people
completely let themselves go, danc-
ing in their own ridiculous ways.
Whether it was the armoying guy
who ﬂailed himself around and invaded every-
one’s space, or the unsure people in the comer
who could allow themselves only to bob their
heads and tap their feet, everyone seemed to be
having a great time being totally blown away by
the musical talent before ﬂiem.

There truly is some great talent coming to the
Pittsburgh area every weekend. Explore it.
Maybe you won’t like everything you hear, but
you’re bound to like something. Pittsburgh might
have dreary weather and smell of a variety of pol-
lutants, but it’s ours. A great way to make it even
better is to put a few bucks into local businesses
and music venues to show your support.

Both weekends, the shows lasted from about
9 pm until 2 am. You can’t get much more
entertainment than that for $5-7. That is, unless
you consider yourself entertained watching drunk
guys play beer pong in the dirty basement of a
house on Sernple Street. And if you do consider
that entertainment, then maybe music can’t save
you after all.

  

Trisha Powell believes that you do not have to
spend a ton of money to have a good time.

 

This is the atmosphere I found -

worked, he worked hard. But as important as

a time -to kickback and relax. Friday nights,

freedom rights.i.:‘*’?-“ 

Regarding the coverage of the Life -
Chain a few weeks ago, we wish to clarify
the confusion between pro-life and pro-choice.

First, let’s put an end to the deceptive label “pro—life.”
Pro-life advocates are really just anti—choice, demanding
that a woman be forced to bear a child when faced with an
unwanted pregnancy. V 4   ’
enough to let them choose between their two options —
carrying the pregnancy to term and abortion. Adoption is
a possibility after birth, but the woman must still bear the
child. _ H

Pr—choice ‘advocates do not support “ “abortion, in all
cases, but we do support a woman’s right to choose in all

contraception.’ We believe that Women should have pro-
tection  forced sterilization. We believe that women
should have the right to safe and legal abortion, even if
they are minors or or can’t take off from work to have
the mandatory coiiirseling 24 hours ‘before the abortion.
Diminished family planning promotes unsafe abortion.
Anti-choice demonstrators are out of line. Rather than

women who will get an abortion in their lifetime, why not
focus on improving sex education, increasing access to
contraception, or adopting a child‘? Is it because anti-
choice is not about the fetus, but about trying to make
women’s decisions for them? .

However, I do not understand why pro-lifers are
held responsible for the women who die this way. After
all, every woman who everdied during an abortion,
legal or illegal, was killed by a pro-choicer.‘ Pro-life
people do not support, encourage or want illegal abor-

Forbes Field: Mazeroski revisits o

MATTHEW SCHLIESMAN
Staff Writer

When former Pittsburgh Pirates legend Bill
Mazeroski stepped onto the sidewalk in front of the
remaining section of the ivy-covered brick outﬁeld
wall that was part of Forbes Field, he received aloud
ovation from nearly 500 people that were there to
greet him Friday.

. Ampliﬁed 73 times, the cheer would be much like
the one 36,683 people gave Mazeroski when he
stepped across home plate after hitting the game-win-
ning home run against the Yankees in game seven of
the 1960 World Series 40 years ago on Friday.

“I never thought anything like this would ever
happen,” Mazeroski said. “I just thought it was anoth-
er home run to win a ball game. I never thought [the
memory] would last this long.”

’ Mazeroski joined the crowd “to relive his tri-

, umphant moment on a day that was bright and smmy,

almost exactly the same as it was on Oct. 13, 1960.
Fans have gone to the wall on Oct. 13 to remember the
game since 1985.

Fans from all over the city come to the celebration
and bring their favorite baseball memories. They lis-

Though George  . ' , 1
Skornickel wasn’t at any of  ' —
the 1960 World Series
games, he came to the wall
with a custom framed pic-
ture of the 1960 Pirates that 
had the autographs of all 25 ~
players and the seven ticket _ _;
stubs from the series sur-
rounding it’.

“I ask other people, ‘Do
you remember what you
were doing in ‘7l and ‘79
when the Pirates won the
series?’ and nobody can
remember,” Skornickel said.
“But anyone old enough to
have been around for the ‘60
series, they can tell you sto-
ties for an hour of what they
were doing and what hap-
pened.”

Skornickel was in high school, but Dorothy King
was at game seven that day, as well as the other three
home games in Pittsburgh. She has gone to the wall
for the last 14 years and reads the scorecard that she

“It was a good time
to be a baseball fan,” King
said. “You could walk down
the street and hear a game
coming out of every house
on the radio. No matter
where you were, you could

stop a stranger and ask,
‘What’s the score?’”

Saul Finkelstein
started playing his tape of the
game just to rekindle his own
memories of baseball at
Forbes Field and watching
game seven at home on tele-
vision with his father. Little
did he know that so many
other Pittsburgh residents
wanted to do the same.

Finkelstein began tha

tape on the anmversary in 1985.

Hoops starts with MidnightMadness 

Men’s and women’s basketball open practice for 2000-01 season;

KENNETH PAUL

Senior Staff Writer

Loud music, pyrotechnics, con-
tests. and students young and old
packed into the Fitzgerald Field
House Friday night to celebrate
Midnight Madness.

0 Over 2,000 students and alumni
were in attendance for the festivi-
ties, which signified the start of the
basketball season for the men’s and
women’s teams. Even NBA star
Brevin Knight showed up to support
his younger brother, Pitt guard
Brandin Knight.

Fox sports anchor Alby
Oxenreiter emceed the night, con-
ducting the contests with assistance
from members of the Pitt Program
Council. 1

The night ran very smoothly and
there was plenty of excitement in
the atmosphere.

“I’m looking forward to seeing
Ricardo Greer and the return of
Isaac ., Hawkins,” said Tim
Zenkshek, a Pitt alumnus who grad-
uated in 1994.

 The fans weren’t the only peo-
ple who were excited,’ though.
Men’s coach Ben Howland and
women’s coach Tracy Waites both
expressed their eagerness for the
season to begin.

“I_’m really excited and even
more excited for the kids,” Waites
said. “I know all of my recruits are
ready and I’m excited about how we
finished last year in the Women’s
National Invitation Tournament.” 4

The women finished with a 16-
13“ record, which enabled them to
earn the birth to. the WNIT.

_ The men’s team; coming off of
an agonizing 13-15 season, is look-
ing to turn things around this sea-
son. " .
=.“The gain of-a new-year brings a
lot of optimism, excitement and

new players,” Howland said. “Just

having more depth and having play-
ers returning that have been in the
program and that are familiar with
the system makes us a better team.”
Howland expressed that he was
pleased to have forward/center
Isaac Hawkins back. «
“In retrospect, with him being

4'-hurt last year, he’s playing now

with what could be a better team,”
he said. .

Friday, fans got to see a glimpse
of eight new Panthers who will be
fighting for playing time this sea-
son. a _

Brown was academically ineligible
last season.

will determine how much playing

The Pittsburgh Pirates’ Search for a
new manager has led them all across
the nation.

There are candidates with prior
managerial experience, such as Buck
Showalter and Larry Bowa.

There are young candidates with
ties to the Pittsburgh area, such as
Gateway-native, A’s bench coach Ken
Macha, as well as San Francisco bench
coach Ron Wotus, who hasrfamily in
Westmoreland County.

And there are candidates from
within the organization, like Tommy
Sandt, Trent Jewett and of course,
Lloyd McClendon. It is the candidacy
of McClendon that puzzles me.

Machi for Macha as Pirates skipper

Cardinals. Easler, if he was still play-
ing the game now, would be about as
successful at the plate as Pat Meares, if
that tells you anything.

This theory of mine is the reason
why I don’t think veterans like Bob
Boone or Willie Randolph, or even

Ken Griffey Sr. have a shot at the V
Pirates job. Those guys did way too

well in their playing careers for
McClatchy or general manager Cam
Bonifay to considerhiring them.

Let’s take a quick look at the guys
the Pirates are discussing as potential
managers:

0 Showalter, who ESPN’s Peter

I Gamrnons says is the front-runner for

the job, is not the right man for the
Bucs. If he could not win with a pay-
roll in Arizona that is twice the size of
what he would have in Pittsburgh,
what can you expect him to do here?

- Easler isn’t a terrible choice, but
I would rather see the Bucs go for
someone. with more experience as a
manager. Obviously Easler has done a
good job, because the Cardinals have
one of the most revered lineups in all
of baseball. However, Kevin. Young
and Brian Giles don’t Stack up to Mar
McGwire: and Jim Edmonds. 

- I would eliminate Jewett, Sandt
and McClendon at the Same time
because they are all members of the
organization already. I would assume
that they aren’t the right people
because of the lack of success that the
Bucs had in 2000.

I like Jewett, and I think he did a
nice job as the manager of Pittsburgh’s
Class AAA affiliate in Nashville. I

would send him back there and let him _

coach for a few more years, and then
he would be ready for a job in the big
leagues.

Sandt is a good advisor for any g

young manager, so if the Pirates go
that route, I would keep him on to help
out the new guy in charge. It can’t hurt,

I right?

As for McClendon, well, I just
hope that he gets that job as the
Phillies manager. That way the Bucs
will be guaranteed to have the best
record in the commonwealth for as
long as he is there. _

0 Macha and Wotus can both be
grouped together as
Pittsburgh ties who have great reputa-
tions around the league. I would prefer
Macha over Wotus, because he has a
little bit more experience, and if the
Bucs go for someone in the Giants
organization, I would rather it be
Dusty Baker, the best manager in the
game.

0 Speaking of Baker, he’s on a list
with guys like Lou Pinella and Felipe

Finkelstein said. “I never imagined it

Mazeroski, who now lives in

the right hits, the right plays and right
pitching at the right time and that’s

, what Wins games,”

Mazeroski had, to work ‘his way
through the crowd to get next to the
stereo playing the game. All the way

there, he smiled and autographed every— .

thing that was put in front of him, from
baseballs and jerseys, to newspapers
and business cards. ’
When the magic moment came on
the tape, 20 minutes past the 3:36 p.m.
mark when Mazeroski actually hit the
home run, he stood up and cheered with
all the fans.
Forty years later, Mazeroski can
still recall his thoughts heading towards
that magic moment. ‘

“We got the two runs with Hal-

Smith’s home run and I’m running out
to the field thinking, ‘Geez, we got this
thing settled, all we got to do is get
three outs and we’re world champs,”’
Mazeroski said. “But one thing after

another and here, you know, it’s tied up. A

“After we got the third out, I’m sit-
ting on the bench, trying to figure out
what we’re going to do and someone
yelled out, ‘Youire up,’ I forgot I was
on deck the last inning. I had no idea
about trying to hit a home run.

“The pitch was down, but in the
high strike zone, and when I hit it, I
knew Yogi Berra was not going to catch
it. If he misplayed it off the wall, I
wanted to be on third base, butathe roar
let out just before I hit secondand I saw

the umpire give the home run signal. I’
. probably didn’t touch ground all the

way from second to home,” Mazeroski
said. ‘ ’
Mazeroski left the wall shortly after
the broadcast ended with other Pirates
Nellie King, Elroy Face and Friend; and

went down to the Forbes Field Tavern  ’

at 29th and Sarah streets and celebrated
the rest of the day with 18 other former
Pirates that included Bob Walk, Kent
Tekulve and Manny Sanguillen.

Even though the
Mazeroski’s, he still kept. a quiet hum-
bleness about himself, much like the

way he did when he played for the
Pirates. ‘

When asked if he would come to
next year’s gathering, Mazeroski jok-
ingly responded, “I don’t know, ifl get
invited.”

‘leave Seattle, and if he does, I’d

expect to see him with the Reds or the
Mets next year.
p 0 Other dark-horse candidates
include Bowa, Boone, Randolph,
Griffey and former Bucs coach Rich
Donnelly. I wouldn’t put ‘too much
stock into anyof those guys. Most of
them are trying to campaign for other
jobs by expressing their interest in the
Pirates position. If any of those guys
get a serious look, it will be Bowa.

So where does that leave us? Well,

I don’t know why, but I see the Pirates,

narrowing the choice down to either
Wotus or Macha. While neither man
has experience‘ at the major league
level, both were successful managers
in the minor leagues. .

As for my choice, I would take
Macha. No, not because his last name
is just one letter different from mine. I
would take Macha because he comes
from a similar situation in Oakland.

. Sure, the A’s -have more talent than the

‘Bucs, but Oakland had a similar pay-
- roll ‘last year, and Macha was a key in
helping the A’s get to the next level as
they won the American League West
this year. '
So there you have it. In this elec-
tion year, I’m voting for Macha for
Pirates manager.

petitive this year. We didn’t have
enough guys to push each other last
year.”

After short speeches by both_

coaches, the players got to intro-
duce themselves to the fans.

Highlighting the introductionss,
much to the delight of the fans and
his teammates, was the popular
junior guard Griffin Abel, who
danced and did a split before intro-
ducing himself.

After the introductions the
men’s team_held a scrimmage, giv-
ing the fans a quick peak at the new
squad. _ .

New players who stood out
were Page, Demetris and Chad
Johnson. Johnson, who sat out las_t
season after he transferred from
Nebraska, showed a nice shooting
touch on the floor.

Six—foot-7-inches freshman
Chevy Troutman showed the fans
his rebounding ability and Brown
illustrated his ball—handling skills.
Greer was his usual self, rebound-
ing and running the floor and
Knight was dishing out assists
throughout the scrimmage.

“If this team improves through-
out the year and the young guys can
step up, then I believe we could be
a dark horse in this conference,”
Howland said. 3

passed to Kyle McAuley, who then
found Caitlyn Welsh 16 yards out on
the right side. Welsh fired a kick in
and Brown was caught out of posi-
tion to defend it.

“That was a bad goal, no doubt
about it,” Sturk said. “I think Rachel
would tell you that she takes respon-
sibility for it. A goaltender of her
caliber doesn’t make that kind of
mistake.”

But Pitt got fired up after the
Providence goal and dropped the
hammer offensively. Keeping the
ball deep in the Friars zone, sopho-

more Lauren Sciocchetti charged
toward the net and was taken down
by a defender. Sciocchetti was
awarded a penalty kick and easily
sent it past Providence goalkeeper
Caroline Haines.

In both overtimes, Pitt earned
ample opportunities to score, but just
couldn’t put the ball past Haines.
She had‘ 11' saves for the day. Brown
had five saves in 70 minutes of
action.

“We have to have a better men-
tality when we’re in front of the goal
to get in and finish things because
we’re certainly getting our chances,”
Sturk said. “We got to put ‘em away,
that’s really the name of our sport.”
