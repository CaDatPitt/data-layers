Solicitation of freshman stu-
dents during registration at Syria
Mosque by campus organizations
having memberships or subscrip-
tions to sell has been banned this
year by John Weber, Business
Manager of the University.

“First year students were fre-
quently subject to imposition dur-
ing registration by campus publi-
cations, and school prganizations,
with the result that sometimes
freshmen thought that purchase of
memberships to these organiza-
tions was part of the regular,reg-

istration procedure,” said Mr.
Weber. “In order to -protect fresh-
men from any imposition and to
eliminate an objectionable feature?
of the registration procedure, the
administration has asked that stu-
dent organizations refraln from so-‘
liciting freshmen until the regular
opening of school.”

Organizations affected by this
edict include the ‘Pitt Panther,
E932 Owl, and the College Associa-

on.

Failure To Earn “12-12”
Brings About Action

 

Fifty-ﬁve men were automatically
depledged from fraternities by the
office of the dean of men with the
opening of registration week. The
men were asked to give up their
pledge pins when for the S:COI1d
consecutive semester they had

None of the men depledged will
be eligible to wear a pledge pin
again until he has obtained‘ 12
credits ‘and the like number -of
quality points. \

Names of the depledged students
have been withheld by the Pitt
Weekly, although every campus
fraternity lost men.

The system which provides for
the depledging was inaugurated
here last year after a prolonged
debate over rushing rules by Inter-
,fraternity Council. In order to as-
sist fraternities in their ﬁnancial
program, ,, a. previous restriction
which prohibited men from pledg-
ing until they met the necessary
requirements was eliminated last
fall. The system whereby they
might accept a trial pledgeship
With hope that attainment of the
necessary credits in, the succeed-

pledgeship permanent, was substi-

Pitt Gets $1,320, 000 1
‘State Appropriation

The University will receive an
appropriation of $1.320,000 from the
State for the next biennum with the
signing of the appropriation bill by
Governor Gifford Pinchot on June
26. At the same time the Governor
vetoed an appropriation of $60,000
which had been asked for the par-
tial maintenance of the new Falk
Clinic.

The amount given the University
this year. is an increase of 10 per-
cent over the appropriation granted
the last -biennum. In signing the
bill_ the Governor cut the Univer-
sity appropriation $300,000 under
the amount which had been passed
earlier by the Legislature.

Fresh Camp
Opens Friday

75 Freshmen Expected To
Leave For sojourn

Arrangements for the first Y. M.
C. A. camp in the history of the
University are complete according
to W. W. ,Mendenhall, Executive
Secretary of the Pitt Y. M. C. A.
Seventy-ﬁve freshmen will camp at
Camp Kon-O-Kwee from Septem-
ber 18 to 20. ‘

Under the leadership of John,
Holbrook,  L’34, general; chair-
 , 
will leavethe campu ‘ at 2 o’.CLlcb
Friday afternoon. The transporta-
tion committee announces that
busses and private cars will be
used to -get the men to the camp.
James Danahey, chairman of the
transportation committee, asks
each of the delegates to call at the
Y office in Activities Bui1ding.bé-
fore noon tomorrow to arrange
deﬁnitely for the transportation ar-
rangements.

The men will break camp at 3
o’clock on Sunday afternoon in or-
der to have plenty of time to re-
turn to class on Monday mornina‘.
The ﬁnal session of talks and dis-
cussions will be held at 2 o'clock
Sunday afternoon in the main audi-
torium of the camp.

According to W. W. Mention-
hall freshman camps were started»
at the University of Pennsylvania
two years ago. Mr. Mendenhall
was active in organizing two camps
at the University of Indiana and
the movement has spread until at
the present time every major cam-
pus in the country has its Y. M.
C. A. camp. This years camp is
the ﬁrst one of its kind at Pitt and
is endorsed by administrative and
department heads. -

The meetings at the camp will be
informal and the idea of the entire
camp life is to “have a good time.”
The men will have the opportunity
of hearing such campus leaders as
Dean of Men Robert C. Clothier,
Registrar J. G. Quick, Dean E. A.

Following its successful inaugu-
ration last year, the project of or-
ganizing a separate division of all
activities in which new freshman
women participate, will extend it-
self this year into coed activities
as well. Last year’s plan made pro-
visions only for those activities
which were entirely composed of
women and, therefore, subject to
the ruling of Womau’s Self Gov-
ernment Association.

The attempt to extend this pol-
icy into all activities in which
women will participate affects the
three ca.-mpus publications, the
Owl, Panther and Vveekly. and al-
so Pitt players and the Orchestra.
This does not mean that freshmen
will have no contact with these or-
ganizations for interest groups
will be formed, sponsored by upper-
classmen for the purpose of demon-
strating and explaining the work
of the activity. At the beginning
of the second semester, after the
freshman has had an opportunity
to become acquainted with the
school and the work of the activity
in which she is interested, she is
ready for active membership.

Miss Rush, assistant dean of
women, has been an enthusiastic
supporter of this plan. “The ad-
vantages of this system are three-
fold,” says Miss Rush. “In the

Fall Rushing

Panhellenic D elegat es
Feel “Hard Times”

 

 

Meeting at Shannopin Country
Club last Wednesday in their first
Annual Fall Conference, members
of Pauhellenic Association serious-
ly considered omitting the fall
rushing period in an effort to lower’
expenses of women's ffaternities.
Representatives of both ,Panhel-
lenic Council and Presidents’ Coun-
cil are concerned and wondering
over the effects of the present na-
tion-wide depression upon new
membership this year.

In ,airing their ﬁnancial difficul-
ties, coeds, realizing that national
dues will prevent possible cuts in
initiation fees, expressed their de-
cision to economize. Elimination
of November rushing which has

been regularly made to establish ’

contacts with second semester
freshmen, transfers from other col-
leges and uppercllaﬁs members,
would be one step. ‘ "

Engineers Meet To
Elect New Officers

Opening another year of group
activity in the University, the ﬁve
departments of the engineering
school will meet next week for
election of cabinet oﬂicers to the
Engineering Association, it was an-
nounced this week by William E.
Brinker, instructor in chemical en-
gineering and sponsor of the or-
ganization.

Two representatives from each
department, one junior and one
senior, are to be elected to the gov-
ernlng cabinet of the engineers’
group. This body of ten students
will serve for the coming school
year, according to Mr. Brinker, un-
tilthe succeeding fall elections.

to become oriented and to decide
in which activities her interest
will be centered. Then, too, it is
advantageous to the upperclass-
man_ for it widens her chances for
participating in activities. ?Lastly,
it is really better for the activities
themselves, for it eliminates the
necessity of making adjustments in
program to take care of inexperi-
enced people.”

The p-lan has proved popular
among the upperclassmen who
have worked under it as well as
with the freshmen whom it affected
last year. .

Rose Marie Demestichas, Junior
representative in Student Council,
is of the opinion that “The plan is
an excellent one. I saw it work
last year in W. S. G. A. There is
no reason why it shouldn't work
in all activities. Incidentally, it's
the best plan I’ve

Student Council will convene for
the new school year Thursday, Sep-
tember 24, according to a state-
ment issued today by Lowman

governing group, . ,

in the ﬁnal meeting of the yearlast

the calm which has enveloped the
‘campus legislators during the va-
cation period. ’

Once school gets underway, how-
ever, a number of problems with
which Council will be“ asked to
grapple suggest themselves.

Student Relations Committee
will have to consider the problem
of an overloaded social calendar.
A survey of this situation was
madelast spring, but the ﬁndings
‘Lhave never been ‘made public.

‘ Customs Need Enforcement.

The Customs committee already
has under way the minor Frosh
customs and it will be the duty of
this group to discover some ade-
quate way of solving the perennial
puzzle of enforcement. V

Selection of chairmen for major
social events will also be made
again this year by Student Council.
The Sophomore Hop, first major
dance, however, is not scheduled
until December, . t

The University’ Symphony Or-
chestra, beginning its sixth season
as a campus activity, will hold its

ﬁrst practice at the Cathedral of

Learning‘ on Thursday, September
24, at 7 o’clock. An increase in the
scope of music played, as well as
in the number of performances and
social affairs are part of the plan
which the officers of the group
hope to execute. According to
Hartman L. Smith, manager of-the
orchestra, more than a hundred
notices have been sent to freshmen
who indicated their interests, in-
structing them as
place of tryouts.

Coach M. S. Rocereto, who is
conducting tryouts for Orchestra
at his offices inthe Werner Build-
ing, Penn avenue, downtown,’ says
that he is particularly interested in
"increasing the woodwind and brass
sections of the organization, and
indicates that freshmen who play
in these sections will be welcome
at his office any time during the
remainder of therweek. .

Formal organization of the or-
chestra will take place in Activi-

outs will be welcomed into the

The Campus,  
Scout Says:

, In just ten more days the University of Pittsburgh football team
will open another season. This season, more, so than any other season,
will give the Pitt football enthusiast a parade of games that will be
good watching, and will have the eyes of the entire country centered on

layed. The season opens next Saturday with Miami University of Ohio
furnishing the opposition. Miami is a newcomer to Pitt football sched-
~l ulés. Because of that and because they are touted to have a potential
“All-American back the game should have a lot of interest for Pitt
‘-fans. Then on the next Saturday Pitt travels to Iowa City to meet
,3‘ we, a member of the Big Ten, in gladiatorial combat. .
J Not much is known about the caliber of the Iowa team this year,
 the fact that they are in the Big Ten is enough to warrant them
having a Class A college outﬁt. It will be a real test for the Panthers
meet them in the second contest of the season. When Iowa has
fire’ It defeated, we hope, then the team returns to the Stadium to meet
A Virginia. From the appearance of the West Virginia team last
“the team this year will be very much harder to subdue. Last
with a bunch of sophomores in the lineup the game was not iced

game worth watching. Western Reserve is met next and should not
furnish much opposition. They will furnish the last breathing spell

iNotre Dame comes next. Last year when Notre Dame played here
handed Pitt 9. merciless drubbing that left Pittsburgh and the foot-
_ « world breathless with the size of the score. This year smarting

gﬁieeting. After Notre Dame Penn State will furnish the opposition.

*- AT HOME

Election time is a greathtime
for ballyhoo. Everywhere you go,
you see signs, “Vote for So—and—So,

Honest, Independent, Able, Fear-
less, and What Have You.”. The
kids have a geat time tossing

cards, heads I win, tails it doesn't
count. -

Personally there is no reason for
comment here on the schemes,
concoctions, and high pressure
salesmanship planned and employ-
ed by would-be public officials

-even though several former col-

legiate gridiron stars were candi-
dates for nomination for the vari-
ous offices in the primary election
held yesterday. But the fact that
a. certain group of judges running
together had as their campaign
slogan “Maintain the traditions of
your courts” recalls Pitt's tradi-
tions on the gridiron since Jock

.Sutherland became head coach

here in 1924.
ODD YEARS, -THE CHARM

It may seem strange but since
that time Pitt has always had a
championship team \in the odd-
numbered years while their record
during the even years of the same
period were only fair, although
improvement has been shown in
the won and lost column each suc-
ceeding even year.

In 1925, Sutherland's second year
as head coach at Pitt, the Panthers
lost an early season game to
Lafayette, the school whose team
he coached before coming here, by
a 20-9 score, but braced sufficiently
to win the rest of the games on
their schedule, climaxing the sea-
son with a 14-0 victory over Penn
at Franklin Field, the victory in-
suring them the Eastern cham-
pionship. ,

Two years later, Pitt had an-
other great team. The team was
undefeated during the regular
campaign, only a scorless tie with
Wash-Jeff marring an otherwise
perfect record. Jap Douds, left
tackle for the Presidents ruined
Pitt hopes in that game continually
stopping Gibby Welch, Pitt’s main
offensive threat. Pitt's 30-0 victory
over Penn State that year in
which Johnny Roepke, State's star
halfback was completely stopped,
gained Pitt an invitation to play
in the Tournament of Roses game
with Stanford. Stanford won that
game 7-6. s

, A PERFECT YEAR .

1929 saw Sutherland pilot the
{Panthers through an undefeated
-season. Pitt opened its season with
a 53-0 victory over Waynesburg
and closed the regular campaign
in a blaze of glory when it was
forced to come from behind for
the ﬁrst time that year to defeat
Penn State, 20-7. Pitt also re-
ceived the bid to play in the
Tournament of Roses game that
year, but something went wrong
and the Panthers received their
worst beating since 1912 when Jim
Thorpe and his Carlisle Indians
handed them a 45-8 defeat. The
score of the post-season game with
Southern California was 47-14.

This is another odd year; and

from reports coming from Camp

Coming Football Record
Recalls Odd- Year Season

 

‘Hamilton where the Panthers are

now ‘in training, hopes are high for
another successful football season.
There are many letter-men return-
ing, including three ends, two
tackles, two guards, two centers,
one fullback, and two halfbacks.
In addition there are many promis-
ing freshmen, Hogan, a quarter-
back; Matesic and Sebastian,
halves; Skladany, an end; Mere-
dith, a tackle, and Onder, a guard.

If tradition holds true, Pitt
should have another championship
team. And if the improvement
shown in each succeeding odd
year contines, Pitt should not only
be undefeated during its regular
campaign, but it should also re-
ceive a bid to play in the Tourna-
ment of Roses and should at least
tie its opponent this time.

HOPES ARE HIGH

None of those persons closely
connected with Pitt athletics will
predict an undefeated season for
the Panthers because they face
their toughest schedule in years.
Iowa is to be met in the second
game of the season. West Virginia
comes to the stadium the follow-
ing week; and then after a set-up
game with Western Reserve, all
the team will be asked to do will
be to beat Notre Dame, Penn
State, Carnegie Tech, Army, and
Nebraska in succession, the ﬁrst of
these two games being played in
alien territory.

It may be too much to ask the
Panthers to wade through such op-
position undefeated, but then
there’s the tradition and the pos-
sibilities of a trip to the coast
where there is, a new crop of
cinema stars. The last time the
Panthers went out there, Con-

Panther Boxers Will Meet
Cadets in Stadium

 

Boxing activities at the Univer-
sity will get under way during the
first week of classes in physical
education. Joe Orsini will be in
charge as instru tor in Trees Gym
and as coach of t. e varsity boxing
team for the second year. Regu-
lar classes in boxing will be held
throughout the year, but the call
for boxing candidates will not be
actually sounded until later this
semester.

The intercollegiate boxing sched-
ule does not start until January,
but a long period of earnest train-
ing will be needed. Pitt's ringmen
must be hardened and seasoned
for a tough schedule. Erection of
a boxing ring was completed at

the Stadium and has eliminated

A

one of the handicaps of last year's
team. ,
Prepares Synopsis.

Coach Orsini, besides supervis-
lng erection of the ring. has been
busy preparing a synopsis on his
favorite sport. It explains various
boxing terms, advises the beginner
in rudiments and explains how
classes and practice sessions should
be conducted. Several local high
school coaches, who will handle
scholastic mitt teams this winter
will use the synopsis. Midland,
Clairton, Rankin, Braddock and
Scott of North Braddock are among
schools who will have teams.

The boxing season this year,
opening and closing at home with
West Virginia on January 30 and
Army on April 5, respectively, in-
cludes seven meets in ten weeks.
The intervening dates are:
February 6———Syracuse, away.

Grace

State, and tied with Nebraska.

Iowa have been added as major
opponents and along with Notre
Dame, Nebraska, Tech, and West
Virginia should give the Panthers
a very busy season of troublesome
Saturday afternoons.

The schedule is rigorous, but the

deVe10D into an aggregatioh closely
resembling the 1929 team which
lost only to Southern California in
the post-season tournament of
Roses game.

Need Klcker.

Thus far Sutherland has been
devoting his time at Camp Hamil-
ton to developing capable reserve
material for his veteran line, and
picking out a quarterback to fill
the shoes of last year's captain,
Eddie Baker. Finding a kicker
who can really kick is another
vexing problem at present, but
several of the men have been show-
ing constant improvement and it
won’t be long until this matter is
decided for the season. Sopho-
more Bobby Hogan, who has done
the lion’s share of quarterbacking
the past two weeks, is kicking
fairly well and should be depend-
able by the time Miami invades the
stadium September 26.

Zola Alpert and Rocco Cutri, who
are giving Hogan a battle’ for the
quarterback position, have also
been getting some nice punts away
and either one is ready to step in
and start barking the signals.
Alpert is the lightest of the trio,
but can pass well and has poise and
conﬁdence to the last degree.
l/Cutri, who injured his shoulder
last year against Western Reserve,
has been looking good in the daily
drills and will continue to push
Hogan who seems to have the in-
side track right now. When the
Panthers first came to camp it was
feared that a capable quarterback
was sadly lacking, and that the
team would be forced to go through
the campaign thus handicapped.
The showing of Hogan as brought
about a change, however, and with
Cutri and Alpert in addition Pitt
will be well fortiﬁed with quarter-
backs who know what it's all about.

Many Backs On Squad.

This year's forward wall ranks
with the best in all Pitt history,
but a team also needs backﬁeld
men who can carry the ball after
the line and other backs have
cleared the way. Coach Sutherland
is certainly not lacking in backﬁeld

They will undoubtedly be the first

Joe Tormey, who gave such a

College Culture

HE MIDD_LE-AGED ALUM-
‘ NUS whose favorite recre-
ations are still ootball games
and musical co ies, familiar
though he may in fact and
in ﬁction, is apparently, after
all, not typical of his kind.

A recent survey conducted
in Brooklyn shows that with
almost robot-like exactitude the
more education a person has,
the higherin the cultural and

, intellectual scale are his rec-
reational pursuits. According
to the ﬁndings of this study,
the typical individual of ele-
mentary schooling seldom en-
ters a public library‘ or an art
museum, reads no phlosophy,
economics, and practically no
fiction, and is likely to be
addicted to the sensational
type of newspaper. The typi-
cal college graduate, on the
other hand, uses libraries and
art museums, attends serious
drama, reads ﬁction; biography,
and science. No college gradu-
ate was found in the survey
who confined his" newspaper
reading to tabloids:

While this survey was made
in Brooklyn, there is no rea-
‘son to doubt that the same re-
sults would be’ obtained should
it be conducted among Pitt.
students. This should stifle.
some of the alarmists who have
long been «bewailing thew tastes _
of college students. On paper
the ﬁndings look like a slot-

S tuden t Opinion

Ii
HE PITT WEEKLY encour-
ages student opinion. For
that reason, it suggeststhat if
you have constructive criticism
or comment on existing condi-
tions to offer, you submit them
to this paper. If they meet
editorial requirements you may
V expect to- have them published.
Mass opinion breathes life
into any organization, but
mass opinion is frequently not
expressed on an even temper.
Remember, it is very easy to
play the part of the fault
ﬁnder. Humans and institu-
tions are so obviously imper-
feet to the one who sits by the
wayside. It is far less hard to
tear down than to build up.
Probably that is why so few
crusading movements ever‘ re-
alize any tangible end!

should see Prof. M. S. Rocereto,
Werner Buildihg, (next door to
the Pitt Theater, Penn, avenue,

and Saturday of this week, in order

we managed -to catch above the

precious notes. But we’ll make
the best of things. 1“

Thereill-. be six concerts: two by
the Chicago with Frederick Stock,
one by the Detroit, one by the
Cleveland, one by the Minneapolis,
and a grand. opening October 30
with the Boston and the masterful
Mr. Roussevitzky. We lean very
heavily on that one, but wé don’t
think we’re quite safe.
evitzky is a bit unequal; he can
make us iresent ‘a tame Eroica
and leave us breathless with a
perfect Festivals in a single even-
ins. But there's sure to be some-
thing amazing, so we'd better go.
Anyway, the first concert, the ﬁrst
tuning up, the first cigarette-mist
spreading over the balcony makes
us all I‘0maI1tics for one more Octo-
ber evening. ‘ V s .

on the Y events. All the artists
