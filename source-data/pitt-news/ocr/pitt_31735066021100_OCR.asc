Perestroika

brings
Soviet

’ to Pitt

By Jessica Coville
Staff Writer

Like many colleges, the
University of Pittsburgh has a
Study Abroad program in which
Pitt students may choose to study
in places such as Spain or France.

In addition, Pitt offers a
Semester at Sea, during which
students travel on a ship to many
different countries in a short peri-
od of time. '

Such are the opportunities for
students in America, but how do
people from other countries

Qcome to the United States as stu-

dents? It is quite common to see
students from India, China and
Africa. What about the Soviet
Union?

Of all the visiting students at
American universities, only 46
are Soviet citizens. Among them
is Pitt student Gintas Vilkelis.

On’ a visiting Chancellor's
Scholarship from the University

QHonors College, Vilkelis studies

in Pitt's physics program, where
he is concentrating on theoretical
particle physics.

However, getting Vilkelis to the
United States was not an easy
feat.

Pitt sophomore Bryan Beatty
and Vilkelis met at the 18th Inter-
national Physics Olympiad’ that
convened in 1987 at Jena, East
Germany. Afterward, Beatty and
Vilkelis kept in touch through let-
ters and phone calls.

One day, while Beatty and

I UHC Dean Alec Stewart were
talking, the topic of having Vilke-
lis study in America came up.

”I don't quite remember who
thought of it first, but the idea was
exciting — to have a student from
the Soviet Union come over and
‘study at Pitt,” said Beatty.

;VWten Vilkelis first heard of the
opportunity to study through the
UHC, he thought it was a good
idea. ”I knew I could get a lot of
benefits from studying in the
United States.

”At Pitt I would be able to
study a new branch of physics
which is part of the theoretical
particle science that is currently
being developed in Vilnus [at the
univeristy in Lithuania],” Vilkelis
said. '

The reaction from both sides of
the globe was very positive. ”We
were surprised,” said Vilkelis
when he spoke of how his fami-
ly and friends took the news.

Panther

By Kathleen Brown
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh's
Panther Prints Yearbook staff is
busy working on the 1989 edi-

tion of the book, which will con-.

tain almost 400 pages recounting
year-round activities.

The yearbook includes sections
on the Greeks, student organiza-
tions, academics, sports, student
life and world events. The univer-
sity's seniors have individual pho-
tos featured in the book as well.

The yearbook receives minimal

funding from the university and
must rely on sponsors to buy ad-
vertising space in the book, ac-
cording to Heather Clark,

‘yearbook editor in chief.

The price of each book is
$28.50, and the student's name
or Greek insignia can be placed
on the front cover for an addition-
al $5. The price includes mailing
costs to the student's home.

Clark noted that after Spring
Break, free posters with calendars
advertising the yearbook will be
distributed around campus.

The staff includes three editaors

nts '89 is on

and an office manager who mon-
itors the funds raised through sub-
scriptions and advertising. The
editors receive a small salary for
their 10-15 hours of work per
week, while general staff mem-
bers are paid according to the
amount of layouts they complete.

In 1987, the Panther Prints bi-
centennial edition received a first-
place award from the American
Scholastic Press Association.

The 1989 edition of the year-
book can be ordered in the Pan-
ther Prints office in 430 William
Pitt Union or in 426 WPU.

Patients
sheltered
at Family
House

By Lisa Goetz
Staff Writer

A plaque on the living room
wall at Family House reads, ”This
little house so very small... Just
big enough for love... That's all!”
Although the rhyme seems awash
with sticky-sweet sentiment, it
describes the facility that be-
comes home to out-of-town fami-
lies with relatives in local
hospitals. *

Family House, located on
McKee Place in Oakland, pro-
vides affordable sleeping rooms
and a homey atmosphere to rela-
tives of patients receiving medi-
cal .tr.ea_t_m,ent for life-threatening’
ailments at Oakland hospitals, ac-
cording to Kitsy McNulty,
manager of Family House.
Rooms are also provided for pa-
tients who are discharged from
the hospital but must stay in Pitts-
burgh for out-patient hospital
care, she added.

Because there are only 39
roomsat Family House, the wait-
ing list is long, and eligibility re-
quirements are strict. Guests at

‘Family House must live at least

100 miles away from Pittsburgh.
Reservations are not accepted
from the families themselves but
must be made through a patient’s
doctor or a hospital's social serv-
ices department, according to
McNulty.

”About 60 percent of the house
 is [usually] occupied by trans-
plant families. The other 40 per-
cent is allotted to people with
other problems. We place an em-
phasis on cancer families because
the American Cancer Society was
one of the house's founders. 
We also accept many neurosur-
gical patients and people under-
going a variety of other
medical-surgical procedures,”
McNulty said.

Once a family has been given
a room, it is theirs for as long as
they need to stay in Pittsburgh.
Guests’ visits are determined by
patients’ hospital stays, according
to McNulty.

The facility, which opened in
November of 1983, is a refur-
bished older house with the an
additional wing. From the street
it appears neat and bright with
two swings on its big, airy porch.
Immediately inside are a tidy liv-
ing room and a library, complete
with a piano and photo albums
filled ‘ with pictures of former

   Sovietfood shortage in years ahead

MOSCOW (AP)_-— President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev called on
the Communist Party yesterday to
take urgent steps to ease chronic
food shortages — the Soviet Un-
ion’s ”biggest wound” —— but he
indicated the problem would ex-
ist for years.

The party's policy-making Cen-
tral Committee began a two-day
meeting largely devoted to
agricultural reform, including a
search for ways to increase the
food supply and improve tradi-
tionally dreary rural life.

The 58-year-old Kremlin lead-
er, himself the son of a southern
Russian peasar‘; srid conditions
in some region )1 the country-
side were at a "critical level,”
with mass migration nf their
population to c.i:"~

so low, he sari mat the Soviet
Union still mu< go abroad to buy
"large quarr as of grain, meat,
fruits, vegetables, sugar, vegeta-
ble oil and some other staples”
to meet domestic demand.

Gorbachev, once the party's
overseer for agriculture, called for

”an agrarian policy that will be

able to restore the pasnt s be

master on the land, and depend-
ably solve the food problem.”

Among the measures endorsed
by Gorbachev was an ”extensive
transition to leasing,” or allowing
work collectives and individuals
to work state-owned farmland in
exchange for a fee. He also said
”more flexible prices” for crops
purchased by the state would go
into effect Jan. 1, 1990.

Discovery mission '

averts early return

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
— Discovery's astronauts over-
came a sticky valve in the elec-
trical system and began restoring
full power to the space shuttle
yesterday, averting the possibili-
ty of an early return to Earth,
NASA said.

The shuttle started drawing fuel
again from a hydrogen tank that
had been closed because of the
valve, said Al Pennington, a flight
director.

The valve, which started jam-
ming shortly after the launch
Monday, had forced the crew to

dim lights and shut down un-
needed computers to conserve
power. The astronauts were in no
danger, but officials said the
problem limited the electricity
available and could have forced
the shuttle to cut short its mission
by one day.

The measure would require

a mandatory registry for people
who wish to be notified when
spraying occurs. .

There-doesn't seem to be a big

Because of perestroika (Soviet

Keeping the human
factor in education

The University of California at Santa Barbara has in-
stituted a videotaped lecture of a popular art class in
order to allow more students to take the overbooked .

class. The national college newspaper U. reported that

more than 1,500 students enrolled in the class. The lec-
ture hall only seated 525 students, so arrangements were
made for the videotaping of lectures to be shown at a
later time, so other students could enroll in the class.

Reaction to this move has beenmixed. One student
commented, "This is the first step to completely de-
humanizing education.” Others were more positive:
"It’s like watching movies, and I like movies better than
lectures anyway.”

C-reat. ‘

Lots of people like movies better than lectures, but
that isn't really the point. While lectures can be about _
movies, and movies can have educational value,
perhaps we could try to keep the two in their own
separate realms.

Taking the human element out of the classroom is
a jarring step, but it is just as meaningless when a profes-
sor is standing in front of hundreds of students speaking."

We have to ask to learn. Memorizing pages of infor-
mation isn't learning — it's memorization. To really
learn, there must be an exchange of ideas. Memoriz-
ing lists and definitions is not a substitute for personal
interaction. ,

Glossaries are seductive. They lead students into the
memorization trap. Instead of interaction, there is a flow.
A flow of data into the brain of the student, with noth-
ing coming back out.

When we ask questions, we are not merely receiv-
ing information. Questioning can be a product of think-
ing and the synthesis of information. Presumabl the
answer provokes more thought. If there is a lack o clar-
ity in a textbook chapter, there is little recourse, except
to pore over more textbooks hoping for something bet-
ter. Research numbs the mind. By theltime you find the
answers, you don't quite care so muc . The process of
questioning has more worth than rot‘/e memorization. .

Answering questions is not the only‘ function of a live
professor. He is also there to listen. When a student has

  a theory, he may want to tell it to someone. He should
.. fkbe telling it to someone with a solid knowledge of the
"subject.

You can't ask a videotape much of anything. You can't
explain your ideas and original thoughts to it. We need
smaller classes, and more interaction, if we want to "re-
humanize” the education process.

Of course, there are problems. Professors want to be
paid for their time. Universities can't afford to hire suffi-
cient staff for 20-student classes. But there are alterna-
tives. Most_lecture classes have recitation sections, and
the emphasis should be on them, though often it is not.
Another alternative is to eliminate lecture and break the
class into recitationswhere a T.A. teaches two classes
per week, and the professor comes in for one. It is an

exchange of quantity time for quality time, and students -.
- who might otherwise never speak one-word to their '

professors could interact with him or her in a classroom,
as it should be. .

The hornsof a major dilemmaj

The university is going to force
me to declare a major soon. I can
-just feel it.

Major-declaring time just sort
of sneaks up on a person, doesn't
it? I can remember a time when
I never even thought about it.
Everyone I knew was "undecid-
ed.” But these days those same
people will turn to me and ask,
”Haven’t you declared a major
yet?” ‘

MINDY
BOFFEMMYER

' And it isn't only friends. Profes-
sors go around the room on the
first day of every class demand-
ing: "your name, year in school,
why you took this class and your
MAJOR." For those of us who
don't have a major and flip
through the course description
booklet in search of classes that
"look interesting/"those ques-
tions can be very embarrassing.

Even worse yet? Relatives. My
parents aren't so bad, but there
seems to be an endless flow of
aunts and uncles who won't hesi-
tate at any family gathering to ask,

"Have you -decided what to D
about what to major in. I haven't
found a subject that interests me: V
so much that I'd like to dedicate
my life to its advancement. And .

major in yet?"

Relatives are the worst because
they never ask directly. They're
thinking, "Don’t you have any
goals? Are you completely un-
motivated? Why are you wasting
your parents hard-earned money

this way?" But they never seem '

to ask these questions aloud. In-
stead they ask a few probing

Besieging the walls that-hide

Little Dutch doll,

Hell within hell.

Hollow faces, and on into eternity.

With the way that things gener-
ally go in life, people develop
defense mechanisms to protect
themselves from _some of the
more painful pictures that are
painted around them.

When pain comes from our at-
tempts to interact with other peo-
ple, we start to hide ourselves
from ‘them. .

These are our individual faces;
known to some as ”the faces of
the Stranger," to others it is sim-
ply "the Wall."

When you have been hurt by

questions: "Are you enjoying
school? Do you like your class-
es? Are you making good
grades?” Then they hit you ‘with
”What are you majoring in?"

Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if
only people didn't ask as if it
were the most important question
in the world. It isn't, you know.
I sometimes feel like answering,
"I’ve decided not to major in any-
thing. I like those helpful CAS
graduate student advisers too
much to be scheduled by some-
one who was trained in the field
I'm entering.”

Those‘ of us who should have
majors but don't, often try to
come up with witty reasons in
order to save face. Of course, I've
never responded, "I’m majoring
in the ’O'." But that's only be-
cause I don't find that one partic-
ularly amusing.

I suppose it might be more
productive to spend time think-
ing about what to major in in-
stead of trying to come up with
a pretentious justification for my

predicament. The truth is, I do,

think about it. Often, in fact. But
I don't like to.

I'm not sure what type of a job
I want. I could hold an ”impor-

everything), or I could work at

wouldn't mind doing either of
those things, b_ut who's to say

. The frustrations of searching for an Oakland apartment

'9

My roommate had her wisdom
teeth taken out over spring break.
Most of you know that it is, for
the most part, a pretty unpleasant
experience, but the mouth heals
pretty quickly, and it is soon for-
gotten.

However, after six days my
roommate still had complications
and was bleeding because her
dentist didn't suture her gums.
Seeing as my roommates and I
were English majors, none of us
knew what to do. Soon panic set
in.

Luckily, we have three gor-
geous dental students living in
the apartment next to ours.
(Looks having nothing to do with
their expertise but are a nice as-
set.) So, in a flash, we were
knocking on their door.

’.’Help, you guys, Margy is
bleeding to death!” we said as the
supermen came flying into our
humble abode.

’’You’re going to be all right,”
they said after they conferred
with each other, ”just call your

dentist tomorrow.” In a flash, the ’

amazing dentists left.
What does this have to do with

[.-..] The intention of this [letter]
is to offer some suggestions‘ on
how to protect your books.
However, I feel it is [important]
to point out and comment upon
the major inaccurate statements

 made in [The Pitt News, Jan. 23, I

”|s(”You'r Campus'Stor‘e buying
your stolen books?”]. Obviously,
the writer of the article is not

familiar with our store. We have »

a sign in our window advertising
that we buy books. The sign has
been in the window for more

‘ than a year. If the writer had paid

attention as she passed by our
store, or if she had been in our
store looking for other merchan-
dise, she certainly would have
been aware of our services. In the
article, she indicates that she

_ spent /several frustrating days of

checking with ”all book buyers"
in the area. That is simply not
true. She never contacted Your
Campus Store. When we are con-
tacted by students, the Pitt Book
Center, or the police, we enter

So many readers ask, ”What do
people in Washington do all day
long?” Believe it or not, we are
no differentfrom superachievers
in other parts of the country.

"r‘.“t%ARt

BUCHWALD

Mostiof the time we make tele-
phone calls, leave messages and
then wait for someone to return
them. We measure our impor-
tance by how long it takes for a
person to get back to us.

Because of this, many
Washingtonians have become
experts on the smoke-screen mes-
sages the secretaries are sending
out to us when we call.

Here's one that is heard fre-
quently: I phone and give my
name. There is a pause of about
45 seconds; I am put on hold,

trying to find an apartment for
next year?

  

JEICA
COVILLE

How often do you get to live
next door to three sexy dental stu-
dents who would do anything for
you, including lending you nails
and eggs? Not very often. Unfor-
tunately, we have to leave our
nice apartment and our nice den-
tists behind to find another place

because the rent is so outrageous l

that we need a cheaper place to
live than South Oakland.

It is ridiculous how high the
rents are jacked up for students

the information into our com-
puter. When we receive books,

we access our computer to deter— '

mine if there is anything on
record about a particular title.
The writer of the article never
contacted us. We wish she had.

LETTERS‘

She also indicates in her article
that she identified three books as
being hers.-That is not true. When
we buy books, we simply put

- them in stacks; we do not sort

them.  The fact that the [three]

books that she identified came.

from different stacks indicates to
us that they were brought in at
different times. In other words,
the three books were not sitting
 together as if they had been
sold to us in one transaction. The
workbook that she identified did
have a document in it which con-
tained her name. The other books
were not positively identified as

and then the secretary returns and
says, ”He’s not at his desk right
now.” This makes me wonder,
”Howifar is her desk from the
boss’ desk for the secretary to
take 45 seconds to discover he is
not there?” Once in a while,
when I lose my temper, I say,
”Well, if he's not at his desk,
would you look and see if he's
hanging outside the window?”

Many of the people I telephone
are ”in a meeting.” Sometimes I
want to know what kind of meet-
ing. I ask, ”|s it a Cabinet meet-
ing, an executive meeting, or a
bowling team meeting?"

”What difference does that
make?” _

”I’d like to speak to him, and
the only meeting I won't interrupt
is the one with the bowling
team.”

The excuse that always bothers
me is, ”Mr. Dominick is tied up
at the moment.” An image im-

who want to live right in Oak-
land. Come on, $480 for a two-
bedroom apartment where the
heat doesn't even work? I know
that there are people out there
who arempaying even more for
their places.

Taking into consideration that
we are college students, and that
title warrants a lot of prejudice,
I still believe that we are getting
screwed.

The incidents of property des-
truction are not of the horrifying
proportions that many landlords
to seem to dramatize. Isn't that
why we have security deposits?
We're being taken to the clean-
ers, folks...

There are some who are lucky
enough not to worry about the
cost of living while attending
school, but then there are those

2 people who are getting financial

aid just to cover tuition, plus
holding various part—time jobs
while having afull schedule of
classes.

Dear Landlords, just because
we seem like we can afford col-
lege doesn’t mean that we can af-
ford to pay outrageous sums of

being hers. ~

The writer indicates that some-
one accused her of lying about
the theft of books. That's simply
not correct.  I did not accuse
her of lying. I simply tried to ex-

[ plain to the police officer that we

have had many situations where
a person will come in and claim
that [his] roommate brought [his]
books in and sold them, and
[then] attempt to get books‘ back
and split the money with the
thief. I certainly was not accusing
her of engaging in such a scam,
but simply trying to inform the
officer of the the problems we
face in the course of offering a
book-buying service to the stu-
dent population of the university.

[...] .

Your Campus Store believes
that each student should take a
positive approach to the preven-
tion of book theft. The following
steps [can] assist students in pro-
tecting their investment in books:
’ 0 Keep alert! Don't expose

gag over his mouth, |isten_ing to

convince him to buy a new Fax.

machine. .
Another notorious excuse for

not talking to me is, ”Mr.‘

Califano is out to lunch.” What's
wrong with this message that it is
at 9:30 in the morning. So I ask
the secretary to have him get
back to me before dinner as I
have a 2 p.m. dental ap-
pointment. ‘

I have a terrible problem about
being rejected on the phone. My
fears run amok when I call some-
one and he won't talk to me,
although I am certain he is there.
In my mind I see him shaking his
head at the secretary, indicating
”no, no,” but I also see his face
breaking into a wide grin’ while
he is doingit.

* . As the day goes on, Ilkeep im-

money for housing!

I know I'm not the only person
who feels this way, and I'm won-
dering what can be done. There
is a statistic available that says the
University ofPittsburgh generates
a considerable amount of money
and jobs for the City of Pitts-
burgh. If it weren't for the schools
in the city, these people wouldn't
have jobs. Then the landlords
wouldn't have anybody to rent
to. Ah, but I seem to be on a
soapbox of sorts, and I shall step
down now.

Currently, my roommates and
I are going through the hassle of
trying to find subletters for the
summer (because it's virtually im-
possible to get a nine-month
lease), along with the rest of
Oakland. .

On top of that, we are trying to
find a nice (I stress nice, folks)
apartment that doesn't cost an
arm and a leg and one that won't
require an hour bus ride to cam-
pus everyday.

Most distressing, however, is
the fact that we'll have to leave
our wonderful dentist friends be-
hind. Who will be there for us

your books to risk by leaving
them unattended in the dormito-
ry lobbies, the library, or the stu-
dent union.

0 Mark your books! Writing
your name and address and

i detailed information on the inside

cover of a book will not make it
unmarketable as a used book. But
such obvious identification can
be erased. As added protection,
pick an even-numbered page,
select a particular line from the
bottom of that page, circle the last
word on that line, and initial it.
Be consistent; use your particular
marks on each of your books.

I have this theory about music.
I believe that for every extreme-
ly popular artist, there is someone
else doing something of the same
sort three (or ten) times better.

For example, people who think
Paul Simon plays world music
have never heard Toure Kundu;
people who think Ministry are in-
dustrial have never heard Einstur-
zende Neubauten; people who
think Bon Jovi is a rock star know
nothing about Nick Cave; people
who think MTV plays metal are

 

just plain wrong.

And people who think the
Talking Heads, who haven't
made a piddle in the rock pool
since 1980, are something spe-
cial, haven’t heard XTC.

Sure, Remain In Light was a su-
per record, but with a dozen
guest musicians who know how
to play all sorts of crazy music,
the four Heads could barely be
heard, except for D. Byrne’s
avant-nerd singing. XTC, in the
meantime, cranked out English
Settlement, a record twice as long
with more musical intelligence
and variety just between the four
of them.

1982's Settlement was their

first diversion from the abrasive,
guitar-based rock they'd been
playing since the late '70s, in
favor of studio-created pop with
tons of ethnic references. After it
was released, the band tried a few
concerts but found the new ar-
rangement impossible to take on
the road, so they retired to the
studio.

The three records that followed
proved singer/composer/ar-
ranger/guitarist Andy Partridge’s
genius and confirmed that the
studio is where he belongs, qual-

ities that became fully evident on .

English Settlement.
His incredible sense of melody
and intriguing compositions

peaked on 1986's Skylarking
with not only a virtuoso perfor-
mance from the band, but the
most lovely arrangements since
Love's Forever Changes.

Also since 1982, the band has
recorded two discs as their
psychedelic alter-ego, the Dukes
of Stratosphere, and Andy has
released a solo record under the
name Mr. Partridge. Let's see,
that's seven magnum opuses in

' seven years.

Now, in 1989, an eighth.
Oranges and Lemons is a double
album (which was preceded by
a 12" single with three extra
songs) and, in a way, I'm let
down. Instead of each song be-_,
ing a new epochal dream of ’ex-\
otic tastes and smells, the new
songs are somewhat uniform.

That's not to say that the mag-
ic is missing; the tunes are still ec-
static with clever instrumentation
and vocal wit. But, where

Skylarking summarized all of the ._
band's power-pop urges in one
song, Oranges, and Lemons is

 

O
dominated by the said sensibili-
ty (and, for.what it's worth, not
quite as well).

So that leaves us with half an
album sounding like ”Earn
Enough For Us” with an extra lay-
er of polish. If Skylarking was
their nod to the Beatles, then
Oranges and Lemons is one to
the Beach Boys.

The songs _are great, but XTC
has always been their brightest P
with their more experimental
material. And the fringe tunes cﬂ
the new record are bright indeed.
Instead of ”g_oing native” with ar-
rangementsiand using only in-
strumentation foreign to the pop
song, they've assimilated the Afri-
can percussion, baroque strings
and Middle Eastern melodies into

\_ the sheen of guitar-pop songs.
\ The effect is almost_ too brilli-

ant, but too -much brilliance isn't
necessarily a bad thing. It all
cpmes down to enjoyment, an .

Sounds, is delightful.

The lyrics are another story.
Partridge’s writing has always
been corny, but he could have
read a newspaper to the tune of
anything on English Settlement
and it would've been stellar. As
a new father, Partridge’s naive
world view and politics on
Oranges and Lemons are pushed
to the hilt, as if he were singing
to a newborn child.

Even on English Settlement Par-
tridge thought that if we could
just get some good music
together and hold hands, all the
problems of racism would dis-
integrate. Now his detailed fables
have as little profundity as ever,

satirizing commercialism (”King

(”Scarecrow People”), and polit-
ical inhumanity (”President

The problem is that there is no
dark side to balance out the ideal-
ism. It’s like ”All You Need Is
Love” without ’’Happiness Is A
Warm Gun.” -

But as before, the utter magnifi-
cence of his craft outshines the
childlike message.

On all but one song, that is. Mr.

Surfers with all their obsession
with bodily parts could get away
with such a blunt and earnest
song and deliver it with so much
charm and naivete. If he is going
to sing songs with a concern for
the young growing up in this
cruel world, he should look be-
low his waist more often.

Kids should listen to Oranges
and Lemons before they become
cynical. Like the Peter Max-style
cover suggests, it is like a cartoon.
Kids watch cartoons because they
understand them, and when they
see them years later, they realize
that the art behind them is ungod-
ly beautiful.

Describing themselves as not
totally rock, but not totally blues
either, Room To Move is simply
a band that must be heard. It you
haven't heard RTM yet, shame on

pressing audiences everywhere.
”There are other bands out
there playing blues,” according
to lead singer Don Szejk. ”But
RTM started out playing blues
music because that’s what we
liked.” Q
And four years later, RTM con-
tinues to play their brand of
blues—oriented rock. This four-
member band consists of Don
Szejk on lead vocals and guitar,
Mark Anderson on guitar, Joe
McGuire on bass, and his brother

Sean on drums.

By Dmitri Ragano
Staff Writer

 

’’I want to be free,” a co-
worker- tells Pelle, the boy hero
of the Danish film Pelle the Con-
queror. Pelle is set in 19th cen-
tury Denmark where women and
the poor had to fight for freedom.
We see this struggle everywhere
in this sprawling epic of the
downtrodden.

In search of work, the widow-
er Lasse (Max von Sydow) and his
young son Pelle (Pelle Hven—
gaard) migrate from Sweden to
Denmark. Lasse finds a iob on a

huge rural estate owned by a
wealthy lecher, Kongstrup, and
his spooky, bottle-swigging wife.

Being ignorant newcomers,
Pelle and Lasse find themselves
at the mercy of their cruel over-
seer (Erik Paaskejl. Pelle soon
learns he can't rely on his father
for protection, or even moral sup-
port. He befriends Rud, a
deformed boy, and a recalcitrant
co-worker, Erik.

Pelle finds himself_an observer
of many subplots. A peasant girl
and a local rich boy are involved
in an affair which is doomed by
their social inequalities. Romance

Ieihe Conqueror

and treachery intermingle else-
where, too. The landowner Kong-
strup, who looks and acts like a
Danish John Tower, suffers pain-
fully at the hands of his wife for
his infidelity.

Few films of such enormity
have looked so beautiful. The
hazy brown skies and vivid land-
scapes sometimes approach the
wonder of the paintings that
come from this time period. The
peoples’ faces have the same pas-
sionate griminess of the scenery.
But luckily, director Bille August
has the sense not to use his cast

of the members agree that Black
Fish is a band with direction and
talent that they admire.

As far as the music scene in
Pittsburgh goes, more openness
is needed. According to Szejk,
”snobbism and pretension do
more harm to local bands. We
need to get more people out
listening to ALL bands. DJs who
spin records for money put bands
out of work. That's not our only
competition, though. Some peo-
ple would rather hear a terrible
top-40 band with electronics than
a good live band.”

What's next for RTM? ”An in-
vestor would be nice. Someone
to back us up financially so that
we could record.”

. Future performance dates in-
clude March 25 at O’Rourke’s in
Squirrel Hill, March 30 at the De-

cade, and March 31 at Bucky‘

Fitzgerald's on Route 51. So
come out and hear what ”rock
with soul” sounds like.

only as scenery.

Max von Sydow has had plenty
of practice brooding and furrow-
ing his brow in his work with Ing-
mar Bergman. His role as the.
graying, sad-sack widower Lasse
has all the precision and sensitiv-

‘ ity .needed for an excellent per-

formance. I always seem to take
Sydow for granted in movies -
he’s understated and dependable.

Ina few short scenes where
he's courting potential wives, he

fumbles along, _,s£t,r.uggli,ng--to_look  .

dignified in the face of total hu-
miliation. These are really
delightful moments — I wish
there were more ofthem. Sydow
brings a lightness that the film
could use more of. '

The rest of the cast is just as
solid. Pelle Hvenegaard, the child
actor who plays Pelle, is blessed
with terrific eyes. In close-up"
shots, his eyes can electrify the
wonder beneath the mask of stoi-
cism he's forced to wear.

I loved the first hour and a half
or so of Pelle. Then, the violent
melodrama became suffocating
and the film became less affect-
ing. Why do so many directors
feel they have to pile on one hor-

' ror after another in order to affect

us?

August is more concerned with
shocking us with the grotesque
than studying the psychology be-
hind it. Every faulty character
pays for his or her shortcoming
with death or a similarly finaliz-
ing atrocity. I've seen episodes of

_Star Trek that kill off stray charac-

ters more tactfully.

Pelle‘ the Conqueror was all the

rage at last year's Cannes Film ’

Festival, where it took Best Film.
It will probably take the an Os-
car for Best Foreign Film as well.
For me, it was both disappointing
and enjoyable: half-and-half
worth seeing. Pelle presents a
rich and fascinating spectacle. It
makes a tedious world breathtak-
ing. That in itself is special.

By John Enright

The Pi It News

One of the first things
you notice about Pitt
sophomore Brian Short-
er is his reticence. He’s
not a loudmouth and
He's not animated,
which accurately de-
scribes Jerome Lane,
Shorter’s predecessor at
the power forward po-
sition on the University
of Pittsburgh basketball

team.
Shorter’s not cocky, unlike
ane, who was a first—round draft
pick of the NBA’s Denver Nug-
gets and was famous at Pitt for his
braggadocio. Of course, many
people would excuse Shorter if
he were a bit arrogant. He may
have reason to be. In his first col-
lege season, Shorter already has
established himself as one of the
' East Conference's best play-
ers, the result of a desire and self-
confidence as strong as his
6—foot-6, 235-pound body.
Shorter, who attended Pitt last
season but couldn’t play because
he failed to meet the academic
guidelines for freshman athletes,
known "as Proposition 48, has car-

ried the Panthers on his broad, -

well—muscled shoulders. When
Pigneeded four consecutive wins
during a four—game homestand in
February, Shorter took control.
He averaged 23.5 points and 9.3
rebounds. Pitt won all four
games.

The Panthers (17-12) will need
another strong effort from Short-
er tonight when they face Ball
State (28-2) in the first round of
the Midwest Regional - of the

. l\EAA Tournament in Indianapo-

lis (Channel 2, 9:30 p.m.).

”In a way, I'm satisfied,_" Short--_

<   Shorter making the grade

er says, "but I want to make sure
we finish the season off with a
good record and just hope we
can go far [in the NCAA Tour-
nament]/’

Shorter’s success has earned
him Big East Newcomer of the
Year honors, ahead of George-
town’s Alonzo Mourning and
Syracuse’s Billy Owens, the over-
whelming preseason favorites for
the award. Shorter was also
named first—team All-Big East,
only the second time in. the
league’s 10-year history a first-
year player has made the squad.
Syracuse’s Pearl Washington was
the other, in 1984.

”At the beginning of the year,”
Shorter says, ”I thought it was go-
ing to be kind of hard because
there were stories about kids
coming back after a year off kind
of rusty and taking awhile to ad-
just. I just took the attitude of
working on the little things and
[doing] the things I can doto help
the team out. I had a lot of confi-
dence in myself, and things
worked out. I wanted to prove to
everybody that, sitting out a year,
they couldn’t forget about me. I

wanted to get back on track with J

everybody. I proved I can play
with anybody.”

Maybe the most astonishing
aspect of Shorter’s success is to
hear Pitt Coach Paul Evans say he
isn't surprised by it. Maybe that's
because Shorter is the guy who

“ scored 1,869 points in three years »

at Simon Gratz High School in
Philadelphia, and would have
broken Wilt Chamberlain's
Philadelphia Public League scor-
ing record had he played his
senior year there. Shorter is the
man‘-child who made first-team
Al|—American at Oak Hill Acade-
my his senior year and was called
the best rebounder in the high

school ranks by Eastern Basket- '

ball magazine. *
Given all these achievements,
it's hard to believe the 20-year-

Brian, Shorter has become the hub of the Pitt offense in only his first year on the squad.

Bisons believe they can defeat;
Syracuse at the free throw line!

LEWISBURG, Pa.
Senior forward Bo Heiden says
the trick for the Bucknell Bison
will be forcing No.7 Syracuse
into a free-throw contest when
they meet the Orange Friday in
the NCAA Midwest Regional
Tournament. . ~ ’

Bucknell, 23-7, is fourth in the
nation in free-throw shooting
with 79 percent, while Syracuse,
27-7, is just 60.9 percent.

”If»it turns into a foul-shooting
contest, we'll win,” said Heiden,
who has averaged 12 points and
6.8 rebounds this year. '

But Coach Charlie Woollum
didn't seem so sure Bucknell
would have an advantage if it
comes down to free-throws late
in the game. ’

”They shoot a lot of free throws
andsooner or later it'll work it-
self out for them,” he said. Syra-
cuse has made 534 of 877 free
throws this year, compared to
Buckne|l’s 577 of 730.

Free-throw percentage didn't
seem to count much with the
oddsmakers, either. USA Today's
Danny Sheridan gave the Bison

(AP) -2

a 50-million-to-1 shot atwinning
the tournament. Vegas Vic was
gentler at 4,000—1 

But Bucknell has won 19 of its
last 22 games and is making its
second NCAA appearance in
three years as the East Coast Con-
ference champion. In 1987, the
Bison lost to Georgetown 75-53
in a first round Southeast Region-
al game. .

The Bison also have excelled in
outside shooting, with 47 percent
from three-point range to 37 per-

cent for Syracuse. That translated I
. into 156 three-pointers of 334 at-

tempts for Bucknell and 128 of
348 for Syracuse. A _
”We will have to play well to
be in the game, but nothing says
we can’t,” said Woollum,
231-161 in 14 years at Bucknell.
Junior guard Mike Joseph and
6-foot-10 senior center Mike
Butts led the Bison with 13.9
points each per game. Butts also
was leading rebounder with 7.9.

Bucknell has outscored its op-
ponents an average of 81 to 74.5.
Syracuse has averaged 90.4. to

”We have to control the tem-
po of the game and hope Syra-
cuse doesn’t shoot well from the
outside,” Heiden said. ”Syracuse

can crash the boards; they can’

play good defense, and they run
the break well. We're going to
have to shoot well from the field,
box out so we don't let Syracuse

get a lot of offensive rebounds, .

seniors, Chris Seneca and Mark _

Allsteadt, played well. Hopeful-
ly we, as the seniors this time, can
play just as well and it will rub
off on the younger guys, so that

we can show them it will be just J

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, March T6, T989

Shorter--:_

Continued from page 15
old Shorter, an avid music
listener, doesn't show even a
modicum of arrogance.

”He was never cocky,” says
Evans.

Shorter is arguably having the
finest season a Pitt player has had
since All—American Billy Knight
averaged 21.8 points and 13.4 re-
bounds and led the Panthers to
the final eight of the NCAA Tour-
nament in 1974.:

”He’s playing like I thought hi
probably could,” Evans says. ”He
started those first seven, eight
games a little inconsistently and
not real confident in what he was
doing. He almost looked like he
was going to take a year to get it
done. But he's really coming into
his own and doing similar things
on this level to what he did in
high school.” .

In Pitt's 29 games, Shorter is
averaging 19.8 points and 9.8 re-

bounds per game. He's shooting0 '

.597 from the floor, a Pitt season
record. He scored a career-high
37 points in a win over then third-
ranked Oklahoma in January.
All this in Shorter’s first colle-

giate season, from a player who‘

is considered short for the pow-
er forward position he plays.

Shorter says he always playeO»

close to the basket when he was
younger because he was always
the tallest guy on the team. That's
not the case anymore, but, Short-
er says, ”l’ve always played
there. That's one of the reasons
why i think I'm still successful
playing down low, even against
guys taller than me."

By Shorter’s junior year in hi h
5ChQ0l». there waslittie doubt ' '
was major college material —— on
the basketball floor. Former Pitt
assistant coach john Calipari says
Shorter was the best ninth—grader
he'd ever seen.

Shorter’s exploits on the‘ Philly
playgrounds had earned him the
nickname ”Messiah.” Actually,
Shorter prefers his latest

tag,”Ox,” given to him by 

/

teammates. ”lt’s a pretty goo
name. I like it. I think itdescribes

me. I'm strong, and I do like to .

bang inside.”

Still, Shorter’s academic short-
comings were obvious. He knew
if he didn't work on his grades,
he would never be anything
morelthan a playground legend.

The summer before Shorter’s"

senior year he left Simon Gratz
and enrolled at Oak Hill Acade-
my, a small preparatory school in
Mouth of Wilson, Va. Oak Hill
annually brings in some‘ of the na-

tion's best basketball players whcﬁt — '

need academic help.

Oak Hill's structured environ-
ment afforded Shorter the oppor-
tunity to put academics
ahead of basketball on his priori-
ty list.

While at Oak Hill, Shorter im-
proved his grade point average to
the NCAA’s required 2.0, but he
couldn't score the necessary 700

on the-Scholastic Aptitude Test HQ ,

be eligible as a freshman. _
The stigma that would follow
Shorter was felt by Oak Hill
basketball coach Steve Smith at
the Dapper Dan Roundball Clas-
sic, an all-star game for high
school players, at the Civic Are-
na two years ago. .
”When Brian was introduced
the people gave him a nice ova-

tion, but the‘ guy sitting behincﬂ‘

.me said, ‘Go read a book,’ "

Smith says. ’’I turned aroundand

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, March its, 1989

Shorter

Continued from page 16
started talking to the guy, and he
was really nice when he found
out who I was. I told Brian there
were going to be a lot of people
like that.

“There was a lot of attention on
‘him. Sports Illustrated did an ar-
ticle on our school, and I told Bri-
an they were going to ask him
about the SAT. The stigma was
there.”

For a time, Evans wouldn't let
the media interview Shorter be-

cause the newspaper stories

labeling him as a “Proposition 48
victim” would damage his con-
ﬁdence.

Shorter admits such, but now
says, "I don't worry about the
stigma of being a Prop 48 guy. I
just think it's unfair to label some-
one as dumb because of that. I'm
not dumb. ‘

“But I think I've overcome that.
I have classes with everybody
else on campus. I don't think I'm
any different than anybody else.
I proved to them in the classroom
that I'm doing the ‘same work as
everybody else. In a way, I want-
ed to prove people wrong. I have
a 2.5 [GPA]/’ he says. Shorter
plans a major in sociology.

Those who know Shorter well

say Oak Hill was the best thing _

that ever happened to him.
‘_‘He’s probably the best adver-
tisement that school could ever
have,” Evans says. "It’s what they
did to get him ready for school
an_d what they did to get him
changed around as a person. You
have to give Brian a lot of the

credit, too. He's changed his at— E

titude a ton."

Smith, in his fourth year at Oak
Hill, remembers the day he went
to Philadelphia to to talk to Short-
er about coming to his school.

“Brian had a tough upbringing.
He had it rough. When I went to
see him in Philly he was riding a

A bike, and it wasn't a:10-speed.

He rode 15 blocks to see me. But
you could tell he wasn't your
typical jive-talking person.

“The first time he was in my -

office he told me, ‘Coach, even

if I don't makethe SAT, I'm bet- '
- ter off here.’ I thought to myself,

‘I'm usually telling the kids that
and here he is telling me this.’ I
said to myself, ‘This kid's going
to make it.’ ” ‘
Smith says one quality distin-
guishes Shorter from the rest.
Desire. —
“Brian worked hard. He got his
C's. I told Brian, ‘If you can't
make A's, you can't make A's.’
People ask me, ‘Can he do the
work at Pitt?’ and I said, ‘Yes, he
wants to prove everybody
wrong.‘ ,
“He’s a good guy and he likes
to have fun. He was quiet here.
He was withdrawn. But I looked
a little into his background, and
I knew where he was coming
from. I hear he's loosened up

_some at Pitt. He's going to suc-
' " ceed, and everybody down here

follows him. They want him to

-succeed.”

Says Shorter, “Oak Hill helped
me grow and get away from the

city. It gave me a chance to do

some thinking being out in the
country. It made me realize the
importance of what I really had
to do to go to college, mainly

how important academics are.” E

Shorter‘s incessant, desire to
achieve has been more than evi-
dent on the basketball floor. Last

_ year was Shorter‘s firstwithout

playing on a team since sixth
grade. But he kept busy. He hit

the books. And hit the weights.
He took his sinewy, well-
developed body and added I3
pounds. He dropped his body fat
5 percent. He worked on his
game.

At the beginning, it wasn't
easy. “Mentally, it started getting
tough when the season came
around. I started feeling kind of
funny because the guys started
practicing and I was just hanging
around," Shorter recalls. “After a
while I got used to it. It became
second nature to me. It felt nice
to see how it is to meet people
on campus and not play basket-
ball, just adjust socially.”

  EXPERIE

But he still envisions what
could have been. All-Americans
Lane and Charles Smith (now
with the NBA’s Los Angeles Clip-
pers) led Pitt to the Big East regu-
lar season championship. Pitt
finished the season 24-7, but with
a second—round tournament loss
to Vanderbilt. Many experts
thought Pitt should have gone
much further, possibly to the Fi-
nal Four. ‘

If Shorter had played on that
team, anything less than a Final
Four appearance would have
been even further below expec-
tations.

“I think about it a lot,” Shorter ,

ATTENTION RESIDENT STUDENTS:    I 

says. “If I would have played, I
think we would have made it to
the Final Four and had a chance
to win the national champion-
ship. I could have backed up Jer-
ome or Charles. With that

mixture, we would have been

real nice.” .

Pitt isn't expected to go as far
in this year's tournament. For
one, the team is young, with five
sophomores starting. Also, there
isn't much depth, as the Panthers
rely primarily on six players. But
they also have Shorter, a player
capable of elevating his game
and consequently his team, to
another level.

"The thing with Brian," says
Smith, “is that he doesn't fear
anybody. It's not an ego trip. He
just doesn't think anybody is bet-
ter than him. He has tremendous
self—confidence.”

Where does Shorter go from
here? Smith and Evans think he
can play in the NBA. But Shorter

. doesn't seem to realize the mag-
nitude of his immense talent. In ,

the Pitt media guide he lists
"working with kids and doing
recreational work” under goals.
Of the NBA, he says, ‘‘I would
like to go there, but I don't want
to put all my hopes into it be-
cause it's not promising. But it's
something I would like_to do.”
