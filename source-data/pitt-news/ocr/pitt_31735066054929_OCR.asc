Scarlet Morgan said her neigh-
borhood comes under siege every
time th_ere is an event at Pitt Stadium
or the Fitzgerald Field House.

.Cars ﬂood the area, known as
West Oakland, making it impossible
for residents to park, according to
Morgan. She lives on Allequippa
Street and said she once had to park
on Fifth Avenue during a Pitt basket-
ball game and carry 10 bags of gro-
ceries four blocks up Cardiac Hill to
her house.

The University plans to build a
14,000—seatcConvocation Center next
to the stadium, a plan Morgan said
would exacerbate the parking short-
age and economically harm the area.
Morgan is a member of
Breachmenders, Inc., a group that
advocates decent and affordable
housing in Oakland.

Arguing that Pitt refuses to listen
to residents’ concerns, several local
community groups, including
Breachmenders, have planned a

meeting Thursday
evening to dis-
cuss ways to gen-
erate negative
publicity for the
University and
possibly take
legal action
against it;

“We no longer
understand why
the University is
doing what it’s

doing,” said
Morgan

“It’s almost
like’ dropping
another Civic

Arena in a neigh-
borhood,” she
said, referring to
the economic decline the Hill
District suffered after the Civic
Arena was built in the late 1960s.

Morgan asked the Student
Government Board at its" meeting last
Tuesday to send a representative to
the meeting.

“I think the student government

a sizable chunk of the money needed
to fund the project, he is concerned

Stars shine again

in ”The  

Golden Age of Hollywood”

David Eskendri
For The Pltt News

Gene Kelly may have danced. his
way off Pitt’s campus with the class
of 1933, but his image, along with
those of a host of other film celebri-
ties, has returned for a photo exhibit
commemorating Hollywood stars of
old. ‘ '

“The Golden Age of Hollywood”
features photos of more than 100
actors and actresses of the 1930s,
‘40s, and ‘50s.

The black and white photos,
somegof which are six decades old,
show stars such as Bette Davis,
Audrey Hepburn, Orson Welles,
John Wayne and_ Marilyn Monroe
and will be featured at Hillman

. Library.

The photos came to Pitt as dona-
tions from newspapers like the for-
mer Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph —
now the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ——
and from wire services as part of
movie studio promotions.

This particular Hollywood dis-
play‘ was chosen by the Curtis
Theatre Collection for its broad
appeal and also because of the return
of classics like “Gone With The

lWind.”

“‘The

Golden Age of

Hollywood’ is a salute to the era and

‘curator of the

its stars, who are still icons of glam-
our to this day,” said Cheryl Padula,
Curtis Theatre
Collection. “The Golden Age saw
the development of film genres that
would become embedded in our cul-
ture, such as horror and gangster
films, musicals and film noir.”

The display is taken from Pitt’s
extensive Curtis Theatre Collection,
which contains an additional 20,000
photos and a Variety of other items
relating to stage and screen from the
past and present. Except for the pho-
tospnow a part of the display, all pho-
tos are stored in a climate—controlled
room in acid-free folders. These
resources are available for use upon
request.

Classic motion picture enthusi-
asts, as well as fans of today’s silver
screen, can take advantage of the
free exhibit, which is open from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through
Friday and until 8 p.m. Tuesday. The
cased collection can be found in the
library’s Special Collections
Reading Room 363 until Sept. 30.

The Ford E. and Harriet R.
Curtis Theatre Collection,_ which
was founded in 1920; is tentatively
planning a future display themed
after upcoming Pitt Theatre presen-
tations, including “Before It Hits
Home” and “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.”

Piﬂbegins campus renovations

Thomas Mitchell

For The Pitt News

This summer, Pitt began several con-

struction and renovation projects designed

to improve the campus. -

According to a memo from Ana
Guzman, director of Pitt’s Facilities
Management, work started in the Cathedral
of Learning and die Fitzgerald Field House.

The projects are divided into three cat-
egories: new construction and renovation,
upgrading facilities, and preservation pro-
jects. Projects such as new student housing
and upgrading the playing ﬁelds are cate-
gorized in the new construction area.

Facilities Management plans to have
new student housing constructed in by
August 31, 1999. ,

The University will also construct new
outdoor baseball ﬁelds, which it hopes will
help recruit players and eventually make
the Pitt men’s baseball team nationally
prominent.

“Having new facilities to play in was
one of the many things that helped per-
suade. me to come to Pitt,” said Matthew
Shoemaker, a transfer student who pitches.

Improvements are also being made to
the Fitzgerald Field House, where locker
rooms, team rooms and training roorrrs will
be built. _

Renovations to the Field House are
under way and‘ improvements should be

completed by February of '1 999.
Other projects include construction of
a student ﬁtness center in Tower A and ren-
ovation of several classrooms across cam-
pus.
In addition, the University is building a
new interactive classroom in Mervis Hall
that will serve 40 people. The new busi-
ness education classroom will be similar to
those in David Lawrence and Benedurn
Halls. The room will have ethemet connec-

tions" at each workstation, as well as tech-

nology for large—scale teleconferencing,
according to Frank lVlil1er, of computer ser-
vice and facilities in the Katz Graduate
Sch8o1 of Business.

Several preservation projects are obvi-
ous to undergraduate students, such as the
improvements to the Catl1edral’s ground
ﬂoor, in which lighting and ﬂoors were
overhauled.

The other major project in this area is
the improvement of the elevators.

‘Implementation of these irnprove—
ments is very challenging, Guzman said in
the memp. One particular problem is that
the elevators are being renovated during
regular operating hours.

Guzrnan’s letter said this is a case
where temporary inconvenience will lead
to permanent. improvement.

“They [the improvement projects] will

all have a major positive impact on the‘

Pittsburgh campus,” said Guzman.

The Appalachian people have missed

due to the fact that their main industries —
coal mining and steel — have diminished

aren’t enough to to live on.

“I work at the McDonald’s down the
street, making $5.50 an hour. I can’t feed
myself or pay my rent on this money,” she

. said “I might as well be homeless”.

“I think what they are doing is good
I’m homeless and I can’t ﬁnd a steady job.
I’m going on the tour just to help Rev.

Jackson said the dichotomy between

rich and poor is widening and the working
class is suffering.

“For the wealthy, the roof has been
removed. For the poor, the ﬂoor has been
removed. Meanwhile, the middle class is
going through a sinking feeling through
downsizing and outsourcing,” Jackson said.

Jackson’s journey to Appalachia will
conclude Sept. 27 in Nelsonville, Ohio.

beginning of the Jewish New Year,
reflect on improving their character
in the year to come, and try to recon-
cile themselves with God and their
fellow people.

“Traditionally, Jews believe that
God judges the world on Yom Kippur
and seals people in the book of life
for another year,” said Wiseman.

The two Jewish holidays mark

the most important time of the year

for Jewish people, said Wiseman.

During Rosh Hashanah, Jews eat
apples and honey with the hope they
will have a sweet new year. Honey
represents the sweetness of a new
beginning and the apples represent
the Jewish people.

Tursomr, 22 SEPTEMBER 1998

FROM PAGE 1

“Jewish people immerse the
entire apple deeply into the honey as
a representation of themselves,” said
Wiseman,.”They are doing it in
hopes to have sweetness in life.”

Yom Kippur services will com-
mence with Kol Nidre, a prayer that
is sung in a low tone in which Jews

' ask God to annul any vows that were

made in the past year. This tradition
started at the time when Jews were
persecuted because of their religion
and as a result forced to convert to
Islam or Christianity.

Wiseman added that information
on services in area synagogues can
be acquired by calling him at the
Hillel Foundation at 681-8875.

EDHQRIAL

Convocation Center will not

cause harm

Not a week goes by without
some civic group complaining
about Pitt’s decision to construct a
building designed to house or
attract students.

Up to bat this week are several
residents living near the area next
to Pitt Stadium where the
Convocation Center will be built.
They’re complaining that the
already pressing problem of park-
ing will be exacerbated, that com-
munication between Pitt and the
community is infrequent, and that
the center would economically
harm the area. _ _

Well, 25,000 -students live in
the area, too. The Convocation
Center is needed to hold special
events like concerts (there’s been a
lot of student criticism that
Pittsburgh is a dull city) and to
help attract top sporting recruits,
which would in turn generate pos-
itive publicity for the University.

_ Parking is a problem at Pitt -—
no one can deny that. But Pitt
appears to be trying to ﬁnd solu-
tions to the problem, and residents
should call it just that: a parking

, problem. It seems like a strange,

childish response to call a meeting
to discuss ways to give Pitt bad
PR, which is what they’re plan-
ning.

to residents

The Convocation Center is
hardly likely to bring economic
harm to the area. In fact, quite the
opposite would be true. Of course,
this doesn’t stop the residents of
West Oakland from linking the
construction of the Convocation
Center with the construction of the

Civic Arena in the ‘60s, which dis- —

placed several families and set the
Hill District on a downward spiral
from which it has never recovered.
' The Convocation Center will
not displace anyone (it is to be
built behind Pitt stadium on
Allequippa Street by Pitt’s OC
parking lot), nor will it bring eco-
nomic harm to the residents —-
students and non-students — of
Oakland.
With the likely construction of
a police mini-station on the top of
the hill, as well as other security
contingencies, the area should be
safe, too. Maybe the added securi-
ty measures will even help allevi-
ate vandalism and theft from cars
on Robinson Street. p
There is justiﬁcation in resi-
dents’ complaints about communi-
ty/University communication and
parking. But these problems are
trivial when compared to the
Convocation Center’s potential
advantages.

On the affairs (and crime) of state

I have come to the regrettable conclusion I
that the President of the United States should be
impeached. Hear me out: I know there has to be

momentous cause for taking such action. Who

in their right mind would suggest otherwise?
Nevertheless, after a re-reading of the
Constitution — a document to which many pay
lip service but few pay attention nowadays —— I
came across this passage in Article VI: “all
treaties made  under the authority of the
United States, shall be the supreme law of the
land.” » I
Cross-referencing this with Chapter 1 of the
Charter of the United Nations — to which the

United Statesis aparty-—IfoundthisinArtic1e ‘

2, clauses 3 and 4: “All Members. shall settle
their international disputes by peaceful means 

.Allmembersshallreﬁ'ainintheirinternational

relations from the threat or use of force against
the territorial integrity or political independence
of any state.” I .

The president and his underlings justiﬁed
the rocket attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan by
invoking the pretext of U.S. f‘nation-
al security,” a concept which the
United States chooses to deﬁne for
itself in deﬁance of international law. ,

supreme law of the land” constitutes a “high

crime” and thus an impeachable olfense under

Article II, Section 4 of ﬂie Constitution.

Yet something tells me that members of
Congress and other Establishment ﬁgures are
not about to follow my line of reasoning on this
one. Otherwise, they would have impeached
Clinton ﬁve years ago, when he unilaterally
launched a rocket attack on Iraq — killing eight
 in the process —_— in “retaliation” for a
mythical plot to assassinate ex-President Bush.

Members of The U.S. Congress bear
responsibility for their own disregard of the frui-
damental tenets of international law. Take as a
case in point the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (UDHR), adopted by most mem-
bers of the United Nations. Human rights advo-

~cates' are celebrating the Dec-laration’s 50th

anniversary this year, and are hoping that in the
future the document will not be trampled on as
wantonly as it has been dining the ﬁrst half-cen-
tury of its existence. They have a long way to go, -
but for now I will highlight one of the obstacles
the U.S. government is throwing in their way.

This conﬂict is portrayed in the U.S. media as a

for the Colombian people.

A document leaked to Amnesty
International in October of 1996 revealed that all
but one of the Colombian military units AI had
implicated in human rights abuses were receiv-
ing so-called “cOuntemarcotics” funding from

the United States. This should not be particular-‘

ly surprising because Colombia has received
$830 million in U.S. “countemarcotics” support
since 1990, and of that, two-thirds has gone for
military-related expenditures.

“Countemarcotics” aid is really being used
to carry out a vicious counterinsurgency war
against the guerrilla Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, the FARC’s civilian sup-
porters, and political opponents of the govern-
ment who are not guerrilla supporters at all. This
war has led to thousands of deaths and the dis-
placement of 1.2 million people from their
homes in the past ﬁve years.

eral relatively successful olfensives
this year, and seems strong enough
now to force the Colombian govern-
ment to the negotiating table. Not
surprisingly, the U.S. Congress now sees the

« need for drastically increased “counternarcotics”

funding — to the tune of $208 million ear-
marked for Colombia in Section 201 of the
“Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act,”
which recently passed the House. However,
only $15 million of this money is actually to be
used to ﬁrnd development programs to give
Colombian peasants a credible alternative to the
cocoa crop. The rest is to be used for military

purposes. How novel for a “counternarcotics”-'

operation. , -

There is still time to stop the bill in the
Senate, and this is worth the effort Nevertheless,
the House vote is a further indication that one
can never expect members of Congress to
impeach the President for war crimes. They’re
as beholden to anti-democratic corporate inter-
ests as he, and they’re not about to call him on it
when it would rebound on them. When it comes
to human rights, they all screw around

Marching band — is it worth olllhe effort?

Chris Griswold
Columnlst

During Saturday’s time/space con-
vergence known as the Pitt/Penn State
game, you may have noticed howhot it
was. You weren’t wearing wool.

Did you wonder about the 250 peo-
ple who were? As you sat in the stands,
getting drunk and doing your own thing,
did you wonder about the sweat-
drenched, exhausted individuals who
somehow marched themselves across
the ﬁeld?

I’m talking about the marching
band.

Have you ever wondered why these
people would gladly choose to exhaust
themselves in dark, heavy uniforms in
front of tens of thousands of people -
most of whom would rather be watching
something else?

' We have.

Every chance we are given to release
ourselves from marching band’s grasp,
we hesitate. We ask ourselves, “why?”

Each year, we grind our teeth and
commit anew — because, for some rea-
son, we actually like it.

But that just leads us back to “why?”
again. ‘

We have so many reasons not to be
in band that it seems strange that we stay.

First of all, hand takes up an inordi- "

nate amount of time. It’s very hard to
keep up with classes, much less a job,

with two—hour practices almost every
night. i

This may sound a bit whiny, espe-
cially since athletes most likely put in as
much or more work than we do. But look
at us: do we look like athletes?

But I digress. In addition to time,
marching band takes a great deal out of
us physically. Our practices — especial-
ly on early Saturday mornings — and

our performances at games can be gruel- ‘ -
'ing. By the end, we are thoroughly bast- 

ed in our own saline-solution gravy.
(That was particularly graphic terminol-
ogy. I apologize.)

And after marching up the hill every
Saturday, a handful of people are ready

to pass out or suffer from some insidious ‘

sun- or heat-instigated malady. We’. 
water like children on a hot summer day,

trying to get it down our throats as=_quick-

ly as possible. A

pissed off, we’re actually pretty happy.
As I was pondering this issue of
friendship, I began to remember my
sophomore year of high school. My best
friend Brady and I felt like outcasts, suf-
fering from what is popularly called
“teen angst.” Neither one of us knew the
other was also suffering from a year-long
bout with depression,for that we had both
been prescribed Prozac. A
We were quintessential early-’90s
teenagers, with an added cynicism that
came from growing up in a rural area.
We listened to Nirvana, absent-mindedly
transcribing lyrics from’ memory during
classes, but we didn’t mourn Kurt

 Cobain’s suicide like “them.”

 that, though we decidedly did

.To top that, I have seen someorre  

leave her crutches in the bleache:rs«--and
forcibly straighten her leg to march dur-
ing halftime.

Also, we get the chance to taste our
saliva after it has passed through a crude
brass still.

Despite all of these reasons not to do
it, we stay. It’s not pride. Screw pride.
One factor alone makes us stay: friends.

‘ I have formed friendships through
band that will never be broken. We often
gather together, stiff’ and sore, and we
complain. But despite being rather

not like most of the people in band, the
few non-zealots made it worthwhile. We
also knew that in the shifting schedules
and friendships of high school, band
remained the only constant, the only
time of day we could be sure to have
people we knew and liked around us.
That friendship continues at Pitt. I
see the same 250 people day after day. I
constantly find myself reﬂexively smil-
ing and waving to my fellow band mem-
bers, whether I know their names or not.
At practices, though exhausted, irri-
table and not yet awake, I can’t seem to
be angry. My friends make it impossible.
We care for each other; we cared right
away, but now, after all we have gone
through, our bonds have become quite
strong.
It’s how we make those straight lines
out there. .
I know that in a few months, band

members will receive letters asking if.

they wish to stay. And, though we will
hesitate, cringe and grit our teeth, we’ll
sign our names. Arid maybe smile.

is “The Bastard.” That’s the way he '

likes it.

J. Michael

Murray

As I sit on. the 35th ﬂoor of the
Cathedral, I ﬁnd myself contemplating

anything and everything but the growing '

sets of problems and lab assignments
rapidly approaching their due dates. I’ve
come to the realization that I have
absorbed more nicotine and caffeine than
engineering concepts and theorems, and on
any given day there have been more than
just those two chemicals ﬂowing through
my veins. .

Please consider, for the sake of my
parents and my political aspirations, that
last thought to be a ﬁctional confession.”

' Drugs are bad, OK? Mary J. Wana is bad.

I had a very interesting dream recently,
during a short period of abstinence from
pot, which, as I implied earlier, I don’t
smoke.

My dream  set in an outdoor cafe’

located in the Old Town Square in Prague.

There I saw Bill Clinton and Fidel Castro

work out their ideological differences over

cigars and more than a few pints of a deli-
' cious Bohemian Pilsner.

I I Bill pulled a cigar ﬁom his vest pock-

~ et and handed it to Castro, who paused to

run it across his nose and inhale the sweet
aroma before sparking up. After a few
experienced puﬂs, Castro — obviously
impressed with the cigar’s quality —- asked

‘Clinton if it came from Cuba.

To this question, Clinton replied, “No,

in fact, it’s a cheap Chinese imitation that /_
was passed to me through one of my

interns.” After a short discussion about
Clinton’s intellectual property  and
his unique process of curing cigars, their
conversation drifted into a plot to re-route
CIA cocaine shipments to Russia to help
speed up the country’s economic metabo-
lism. The rest of the dream evolved into
some truly unbelievable scenarios.

On a slightly more serious note, I’d
like to toss in my proverbial two cents
regarding the impeachment situation in
Washington. Diverting attention from non-
trivial breachesof public trust, the powers

scapegoat to the masses. The Republicans
spearheading this witch hunt are the same
people who railroaded‘ campaign ﬁnance

Of course, the. public and the media
stand ﬂaccid on this issue, as Mark

rails than Union Federal the night he hit 62.
The Democrats have abandoned their lib-
eral base, moving further and further right
with every transgression on the Bill of
Rights in the name of the “War on Drugs.”
These transgressions are inevitably leading
us into a fascist state, if we’re not there
already. As Uncle Sam wheezes out his last
breath of freedom 10 years down the line,

Adding more fuel Io the bonfire

Adrian Kimble

Columnlst

A rally is a wonderful opportunity
for the masses to unite, join in a com-
mon cause and cheer the working class-
es to victory. It can also serve as a
morale booster, like last Thursday’s
bonﬁre spotlighting the Pitt football
team. ‘

Solidarity should, however, tran-
scend a mere sports game. I cheered the
Pitt football team’s valiant efforts

. against Penn State — a metaphor for the

resistance of the working classes against
the bourgeoisie, with the inevitable
result in almost nine out of 10 instances
the bourgeoisie will win 20-13. Fear not,
for the time of the proletariat is at hand.
_ It disturbs me that the bonﬁre may
have been used as a political vehicle for
our very own Student Government
Board president, Alyson Wallach. While
you may see me as a David Duchovny
with a clenched ﬁst, Maols little red
book and a black beret, I will try to stay
away from fantasizing about shagging
the socialist equivalent of a Gillian
Anderson, and give credence to my con-
spiracy.

As president of the Blue and Gold
Society (a.k.a. the students act all lovey-
dovey with alumni club), Alyson
Wallach organized last year’s bonﬁre.
The event was hailed a success, and
Wallach used it to storm to victory in the

SGB Presidential elections. She stressed
communication between SGB and stu-
dents, campus unity, and all that other
rubbish.

Furthermore, she used the bonﬁre to
fuel her bourgeois desire to dominate
Pitt students. This year, she usurped
power herself, using SGB and the Pitt
Program Council I
to gain control of
the bonﬁre.

In an article in
the Sept. 16 issue
of The Pitt News,
she said, “The Blue
and Gold Society is
honored that SGB
and PPC are taking
over and making
the bonﬁre an
annual event.”

I reckon that
the quivering
alumni of Blue and
Gold have no
bloody choice. It’s
a case of “do as
you’re told or I’ll chew your bloody leg
off!” Wallach now has two bonﬁres to
put on her resume, as well as a lot of
glowing references and kind words from
her supporting elves in the SGB ofﬁces.

Friends, bonﬁres are rubbish. Under
the auspice of generating unity for any
event, they serve as a mask to conceal a
Draconian agenda. Though I do not have

CATHLEEN O'MALLEY/ STAFF ILLUSTRATOR

the mental faculty, resources or scabs to
reveal a far-reaching conspiracy (my hat
still goes off to former The Pitt News
Editor in Chief Anthony Breznican for
uncovering the scandals of last year), I
will die trying!

Bonﬁres served to fry and bake the
solidarity of the masses. The Ku Klux
Klan uses ﬁre to
roast its crosses
(if members
drank Polish
vodka instead of
moonshine, they
would not be so
backward in their
views). There
were book burn-
ings in Germany
in the 1930s, and I
wonder if they
were carried out
under the pretense
of celebrating
before a big soc-
cer game.

We must stop
surrounding bonﬁres on the Cathedral
Lawn. Where the ﬁre scarred the earth
and broiled the grass, we must erect a
statue in honor ofV. I..Lenin. A march
around the icon of the working masses is
much more productive than a march
around a bloody ﬁre! Instead of shout-
ing “Penn State sucks,” we should shout
“the workers united will never’ be

defeated!”

I too felt proud of Pitt football coach
Walt Harris for riling up the students.
But I couldn’t help noticing that his
speech was suspiciously low on quotes
from Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao
Tse Tung, Ho Chi Minh and Trotsky.
After all, football is the game of the pro-
letariat. It’s not a bloody ponce game
like cricket, croquet, dominoes or ten-
nis!

This past summer, I wrote a column
about my obsession with Wallach,
undermining my socialist sensibilities.
This time, I write about how Wallach’s
usurpation of power undemiines real
school spirit. Maybe love conquers all,
but solidarity among the workers slices,
dices, splices, kills, pounds,‘ hammers,
nukes, maims, destroys, annihilates and
singes the system of capitalism that
Americans have been foolishly brought
up to love.

While the bonﬁre is long gone, Penn

S State won unconvincingly, and Wallach

is beaming over her newly acquired rec-
ommendations, I will say, “the students
united will never be defeated.”

Next time, drop the ﬂames, pick up
the picket boards, and support both Pitt
and the aspirations of the working class.

Adrian Kimble would ' never usurp
power for the sake of a bloody rotten
ﬁre, but would to get his paws on a plat-
inum hammer and sickle.

 

Lytle leads Pitt’s
offense with
tough altitude

One word can describe Matt Lytle
after Saturday’s contest:

Woozy.

Entering the media room after a
20-13 loss, the quarterback squinted at
the bright camera lights and searched
desperately for his chair, plopping
down quickly and laying his arms on a
table in a stance of complete exhaus-
tion.

He moved his head from left to

‘right, shaking off cobwebs that he

alone could see. -

His eyes reﬂected the lights of the
room all too easily, leaving the press to
wonder if anything behind those eyes
was still working.

His head bore the marks of all eight
sacks — pink indentations into his
sweat—soaked skin sho‘wed where his
helmet ﬁt just a little too tightly and
where his head had crashed into the
stadium turf a little too hard.

For The Pitt News

At his weekly press conference
yesterday, head football coach Walt

‘Harris struggled to explain the fine

line between being proud of his
football team for nearly upsetting
eighth-ranked Penn State and being
satisfied with a loss.

“A couple days after the game
on Saturday, I think we are even
moredisappointed,” Harris said. .

The coach said he believed near-

ly overcoming‘ a deficit against‘ a‘

good team like the Nittany Lions
can be an important step’ in the
process of becoming a winning
team. ’ .

“I think it happened a year ago
when we were able to come back on
Syracuse. That gave our players the

‘confidence that helped us in our

final two ball games,” he said
Harris said“ part of the reason

Pitt was not able to “get over the

hump” against Penn State was

Even the tape on Lytle’s wrist was

ripped. .

The normally verbose leader of the
1998 Pitt Panthers ‘answered questions
with phrases such as “Yeah” and “I
think so.” ' -

When a reporter asked how he
thought he’d played, Lytle just
answered, “Lousy.” ‘C ,

And when another reporter asked
him how he felt, the Pitt senior shook
away some more Cobwebs and said, in
what may have been the most genuine

statement ever made at a postgame

press conference, “My head hurts.”
Lytle took a beating Saturday.

He did it because his line is young, .

because the Penn State defense is better
than adrenaline-pumped. Pitt fans are
willing to admit, and because the
Nittany Lion secondary blanketed Pitt

receivers for much of the -game.

And he did it because he is a war-
rior. _

Going into the final drive of
Saturday’s game, Lytle had been

. sacked ﬁve times. He had scrambled

for yardage on nine other occasions,
refusing to slide and being hammered
for his efforts.

He ran the option for the first time,
facing a horde of Nittany Lions as he
rounded the corner of the Pitt line,
pitching the ball to Brandon Williams
before eating white helmets.

The Pitt men’s soccer
team’s unbeaten streak came

to ‘an end this weekend as it‘

dropped one of two games,
defeating Villanova 1-0 Friday
and falling short 1-0 to
Rutgers in overtime Sunday.
Phil Matilla ‘had the only
Panther goal this weekend in
Friday’s victory over the
Villanova Wildcats. The goal
came in the 57th minute, off
an assist from Spencer Barton.
In the victory, Panther
goalkeeper Chris Hanlon was
perfect, stopping all six
Wildcat shots to record the
shutout. ‘

Pitt’s .lone score-was one

of only three shots .-on
Villanova ' goalkeeper Matt
Malek. \

Friday’s win extended
Pittsburgh’s unbeaten record
t0 4-0-2. ‘ i

This record stood until
Sunday, when the team went
into its first overtime of the
season with Rutgers. '

Rutgers struck in the
94th minute, when the
Scarlet Knights’ ' Brian
Piesner scored on a break-
away’ pass from teammate
Chris Stewart.

The Panthers managed
to tally only four shots in
Sunday’s game. Pitt’s lead-
ing scorer, Drew Kopp,
had only one shot, record-
ing no points for the
Panthers in this weekend’s
road contests.

. , Rutgers came on strong
against the Pittsburgh
defense, recording 21
shots.

Chris Hanlon had six saves

‘on seven shots, and Jon

Conway recorded the
shutout for Rutgers.

Pitt’s first loss drops
the team’s record to 4-1-2.

For The Pitt News

After last week’s defeat at the Sun Trust
Invitational Tournament, the Pitt women’s
volleyball team hada lot of recovering to do.

Last Wednesday’s game proved the

* team did not_ have enough time to accom-

plish that recovery. After a fantastic start, the
Lady Panthers lost another game.

Pitt put up a ﬁght against Ohio State,
but lost consecutively with scores of 15-7,
15-7 and 15-8.

Jenna Birkel tried to hold off Ohio with
her nine kills, but was no match for Rosie
Show, who ended the night with 19 kills and

‘led Ohio to its win.

Cross country tries to counteract
youth and inexperience

Pitt runs at Akron

After Pitt’s dual meet at West
Virginia Sept. 5, cross country
coach Dave-Sobal blamed the loss
on lack of experience. Many of the
athletes were running in their first
intercollegiate race.

The men and women on the
cross country teams took the expe-
rience they gained from the dual

meet and put it to use at the Tommy-

Evans Invitational at Akron
University. The women finished a
close second behind Kent State,
while the men finished fifth in a

"six-team field.

“I was very pleased with the
women’s effort. We are finally at
full strength, and we showed what
we are capable of doing,” Sobal
said.

The women’s team placed five
runners in the top 13 at the meet.
Lauren Fittz crossed the finish line
first for the Panthers and finished in
sixth place overall. Also giving an
impressive performance was fresh-
man Danielle Rhodes, who finished
eighth.

us a boost, something that is hard to
get from freshmen,” Sobal said.

The men finished in fifth place,
with Mike Orzechowski leading the
pack, finishing in fifth place for the
second straight week. His success
has brought a positive atmosphere
to the team.

“Mike has been great for us. He
leads by example and everyone else
just follows. Just having him on the
team makes a big difference,” Sobal
said.  ‘O

Despite acknowledging that the
team is not a top program, Sobal
believes in the abilities of his
squad. ‘

“Distance . runners are made
through hard work. Our team is pre-
pared to get better each week. We
know what it takes to be a good

program, and we are making strides

to become one,” Sobal said.

Pitt runs at
State College

' Pitt’s men’s and women’s cross

country teams travelled to State.

College Sept. 19 to compete in the
20th annual Spiked Shoe
Invitational Meet. Twelve schools,
including Pittsburgh, competed in
the run on the Penn State Blue and
White golf courses.

The men’s team placed 10th in
the 5.2-‘ mile invitational meet.
Mike Orzechowski was the highest
placing runner for Pitt, coming in
42nd with a time of 28:05.93. He
was followed by John Becker, Kyle
Davis, Kelly Hanlin and Justin
Wiley.

Penn‘ State’s men’s team placed
first, with its highest runner coming

in fifth, 1:55 ahead of Pitt’s leading»

runner, Frank Bruder

Pitt’s women’s team fared a lit-
tle better than the men’s team, plac-
ing fifth out of eight teams in a
5,000-meter run. Lauren Fittz was
the highest placing runner for Pitt,
coming in 22nd with a time of
19:03.88. She was followed by
Danielle Rhodes, Stacey Anderson,
Amanda Schmidt, .Wendy Lampart,
Sarah McMillan and Jessica
Raymer. ‘

Penn State’s women’s team also

“I don’t think that we went into
the Penn State game thinking that we
were going to win. That’s under-
standable,” Harris said.

“When we become established as

_a program that is consistently a win-

ner, then I think you change from
going in to every game trying to play
hard to going in to every game
expecting to win.”

Harris believes that the Panthers
will face a daunting task when they

, play Virginia Tech this weekend.

“They have very good running
backs,-as well as an outstanding
defense,” he said. “We’re also wor-

ried about the speed they have at

Harris commented about the
Hokies’ senior quarterback Al
Clarke, who is doubtful to play this
weekend, saying, “I’m saddened to
hear that a great competitor like him
and a senior like he is may not be
able to play this week, but I don’t

into thegame on_Saturday without
the aid of senior running back Chris
Schneider, who will sit out the game
with an injury. I

In an uncharacteristic move,
Coach Harris interrupted his own
response to answer a question on
everyone’s mind:

“I tell you, I would like to say

one thing. I haven’t been to any Pitt-
Penn State football ‘games [at Pitt
Stadium], but I thought our crowd
and our students and our fans in par-
ticular were a huge reason why we
were able to play as well as we were
able to play against that ball club.

“I’m praying that that atmos-
phere, excitement, and the way our
players played won’t be just a once
every two year deal.”

“I hope it will be a weekly situa-
tion because it really made a differ-
ence in our ability to play.”

As for the possibility of athletics
director Steve Pederson extending
the 94-year-old Pitt-Penn State
rivalry for 10 additional years,
Harris said, “I read where the guy I
work for wanted a 30-year deal, so
I’m with him.”
