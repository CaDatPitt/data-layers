Pledg_e__l§lumbers Rise As Successful Fraternity Rushing

Fraternities Get
191 Pledges After
Rushing Season

“Best Conducted Rushing Season
Ever Seen Here,” Says
Theodore Biddle

Expect M o r e Pledges

One hundred and ninety-one
pledges take their places at fra-
ternity tables today as the suc-
cessful rushing season for men's
fraternities somes to a close. Ex-
ceeding last year’: mark by 28
men, this year's group enters
fraternity life at the University
following a nine-day hectllc rush-
ing period.

Five hundred and ﬁfty-one bids were
received by the office’ of Mr; Biddle
for three hundred and seventy-six
boys. A good many more will be
pledged next week, said Mr. Biddle
as the pledging came to a close yes-
terday afternoon.

“This year's was the best conduct-
ed rushing season ever to take place
at Pitt," said Mr. Biddle. “It seems
as though present freshmen seem
to have more money than in former
years and that fraternity rates are
more reasonable. There has been a
wealth of fraternity material.”

Student Assembly
Called Wednesday

Fourth-hour Classes will Be
Dismissed For Meeting

All fourth-hour classes in the
University will be dismissed next
Wednesday morning so that students
may attend the pep assembly in
Memorial Hall.

Given under the auspices of Student
Council to inspirit the Panthers be-
fore their Notre Dame tussle, the
meeting will feature Coach John B.
Sutherland, Judge Ralph H. Smith
and the Golden Cats themselves.

Both the University band and the
cheerleaders will be present to help
honor the team. Pitt's new victory
song will be played and the slogan
of the affair will be, “C’mon Pan-
thers, Claw the Irish."

The assembly is under the super-
vision of George Roll, Ed3, chair-
man of Council's assemblies commit-
tee, and is the ﬁrst of a series planned
by the legislative body for the year.
Subsequent meetings will introduce
prominent national speakers. No other
football rallies are yet scheduled,

According to Roll, Dr. Sutherland
and Judge Smith will each address
Wednesday's group. Members of the
team will sit on the stage, but are
not scheduled to speak,

Memories of Pitt's surprise triumph
over Notre Dame last season, and
hopes for a repetition of the victory
in South Bend next Saturday, promise
a large attendance.

an

Absentee Check
Planned By Held

Only “ Cuts’ ’ Detrimental To
Study Will Be Reported To Dean

A new system has been devised
throughout the University for
checking up on absentees, according
to Dr. Omar C. Held, assistant to the
dean of the College.

Unlike last year’s method of re-
porting each individual absence to
the dean of the department, this year
only those absences detrimental to
University work will be sent in. The
University is especially interested in
those students whose absences are
due to illness, those who have with-
drawn without formal notiﬁcation,

i and those who are absent without

good ‘cause. .
Each teacher will, note the absen-

A tees in his classes and will report

them to the head of his department,

school.

To the Students of the

On November 7 the voters
of this state will pass upon
twelve proposed amendments to
the state constitution.

One of these amendments,
Number 8, authorizes “a $25.-
000,000 bond issue to defray
the expenses of the state dur-
ing the next biennium. If this
amendment fails:

1. Hunger and misery will
fall upon from two to three
million Pennsylvaniansthis
winter.

2. Pennsylvania will not
be eligible to receive its
share of Federal relief funds.

3. New taxes will have
to be imposed.

4. One hundred and Sixty-
five hospitals will have to
curtail or discontinue their
free ward and dispensary
services.

And

5. The University's state
appropriations. already re-
duced by $132,000, will re-
ceive a further reduction of
$396,000. Such a result
would cripple the Univer-

sity for years to come.

Of $25,000,000 Bond

Failure Of Move Means
$396,000 Loss To
University

 

Thirty-ﬁve thousand, four hundred

alumni, students, parents of students,

faculty members, administration staff
and friends of the University will be
contacted by mail this week by the
General Alumni Association in the
ﬁrst offensive of its educational cam-
paign for the passing of Amendment
8 to the State constitution at the
polls on November 7.

Amendment 8 is one of twelve to
be presented to the voters of Penn-
sylvania for approval at the polls on
November 7. The amendment pro-
vides for a $25,000,000 bond issue to
defray expenses of the state for two
years. Twenty million, one hundred
thousand dollars will go to food and
work relief, $2,231,365 ‘ for grants to
hospitals and the balance ofthe ls-
sue will go to provide for interest

and sinking fund to retire the bond »

issue, »

Failure of this bond issue, besides
seriously crippling hospitals and wel-
fare organizations, directly involves
the future of state-aided universities
and schools. If the bond issue does
not pass, one-third of the appropria-
tions granted at the last session of
the legislature to the four state-aided
universities, Temple, Penn State, Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania and Pitt will
be lost.

Pitt’s budget has already been cut
about $132,000; the additional cut, it
Amendment 8 fails to pass, will
amount to $396,000 and would cripple
the school’s services to the community
for years to come.

J. W. Hallock, secretary of the

General Alumni association, is di-
recting Pitt's part in the campaign
throughout the state and has organ-
ized alumni committees in ﬁfty-six

- P*“=°'*i!-

counties. Pitt's county committees
will cooperate with committees from
the University of Pennsylvania, Penn
State, Temple and with local welfare
units and local hospitals in their
campaigns to support Amendment 8.

On November 2 and 3 alumni, stu-
dents and personnel of the Univer-
sity will receive envelopes contain-
ing post cards that give pertinent
facts and ﬁgures on the emergency
that exists in the state. Recipients

of the cards will be asked to sign‘

and mail them to voters requesting
them to support Amendment 8,

Vhonorary pre-legal group. With power to rescind
charters from campus organizations and to sub-
poena activities leaders to appear before the
,group, the investigations committee is at last the
7’group that campus organizations have needed.

C Campus organizations that have been ,lax in
their activities and have been content to exist in
fgviacuo, giving occasional pink teas and donating
 goldl keys, might do well to prepare for the spot-
 of the investigations group. It appears, ﬁnal-
that the committee isn’t merely a ﬁgurehead

There is little danger that the investigating
ommittee will abuse its power. Certainly in less
 capable hands the entire movement might become

lithe advantage of certain campus political leaders.

 Inevitable, In 1934

 C ECLARATIONS IN THE PUBLIC press, in speeches
 , I of “ “intellectuals,” and in many classrooms that
, “war is inevitable in 1934” are neither statements of

(‘publicity-mad alarmists nor professional paciﬁsts. Polit-
ically and economically, a greater World War is inevit-
ii able in 1934 unless drastic measures are taken, we are
ﬁtold in the liberal press. Whether or not Japan and
5jRussia will start the conﬁagration; whether England’s,
iicontlict in the Orient with Japan for world trade will
-{start war in the Paciﬁc; whether the unbearable yoke of
gthe, Versailles Treaty provisions will make Hitler's Ger-
fmany take a crack at France; whether Japan's economic
Imperialism In the Pacific endanger United States island
‘ ‘possessions and Australia; whether the stubborn nation-

; jalism and militarism of France Wlll anger Italy who has
‘too long had an eager eye on France’ African trade; all
«L/these reasons and more fade in the face of the indiffer-
ence which Pitt students, and American university stu-
dents in general, show concerning these important and
I impressive world events.

I In the workings of social psychology we can vision
‘that pride in the blue and gold ROTC uniform, the
céiheightened pulse beat when the bands play martial airs,
gand the pride of pretty girls in the sword and brass but-
tons of khaki uniforms. With the experience of the bor-
-‘irors of war, with staggering war debts, with four -years
of.De"pression misery directly resulting from the effects
I of the last combat, and with the prediction of economists
and political scientists that another World War will be
an economic and social catastrophe to civilization, stu-
dents remain only slightly concerned and then only in
the gloriﬁed fringes that make up war’s glamour and at-
A «tion. _

   EVELOPING INTO WHAT promises to be-

aﬁousl Points; ; A

Effluvia
“A Subtle Emanation”
By Saul Weisberg

HAVE JUST RECEIVED my ﬁrst letter and I am In-

clined to make a great fuss over it, for it marks a
turning point in this column. From this time on, I can
move ahead, safe in the belief that I have at least a few
readers interested enough to signify their agreement or
disagreement with the views I uphold. And that, of
course,.is what I desire. After all, there is little on-
joyment in writing a column unless one feels that he is
stirring up a little thought, a little discussion, even a
little excitement.

Especially do I want letters from those persons who
oppose my opinions. For then I no longer wil1,have
the fear that I am pouring out my material Into a pas-
sive and non-resistant coagulation of student brain cells.
And I promise that I will print all letters fithin the
limits of my allotted space.

HE FIRST LETTER FOLLOWS: “Dear Efflu-
via: It appears that Dormont's councilmanic

candidate, John Bracken, president of ODK, dares to
do what angels fear to contemp1ate—he travels to
Washington to bid President Roosevelt for ODK’s
surprise tappee. In defense of the angels be it said
that we assume that there are no political parties to
disturb the serenity of Heaven and, consequently, no
celestial Guffey to smooth the way for ambitious
cherubims.

“President Roosevelt is not, however, to be severe-
ly pitied. In return for his 200 dollars and lodging
a day, the chief executive is expected to perform cer-
tain baby-kissing publicity duties for the glory of
the party and the ediﬁcation of the populace. Or-
dinarily these political playlets have been achieved
with the aid of characteristic North American fauna,
Indians, not ODK members. Quaking Quaker Hoov-
er had his disturbing Seminole ﬁascos, and Paleface
Calvin Coolidge was made chief of a. sizeable Da-
kota tribe.

(5 UT TODAY WE ARE rising above solidiﬁed

tradition. Certainly, the fruitful ODK mem-
bers are as deserving, if not as colorful, as the Van-
ishing Americans, and should age-old precedents be
broken, we hope to be among the ﬁrst to point with
pride to the noble experiment of the party of the
donkey. But since ODK can hardly show us magni-
ﬁcant feather head-dresses, readily photographed, it
is to be hoped that it will at least contrive an In-
spiring midnight dance around Totem-pole cathedral.

“Trapper Scouts Bracken and Danahey are men
of long vision. They may yet be the fathers of a
great University legend: As the President of ODK
said to the President of USA, ‘We’d like to tap ya’."

(Signed)
A Former Pitt Student.
HE ABOVE LETTER is undoubtedly a little merci-
less and harsh, but nevertheless it serves to bring
attention to bear upon the ODK and its purposes and
activities. I myself am frank to admit that I have never
been quite sure exactly what the function of an honor-
ary fraternity is. And I'd like to find out. I’ve always

been somewhat skeptical of the activities of these hon-

orary fraternal organizations. I never knew, for in-
stance, whether ODK was a sublimated Student Council
or merely a group of nice fellows who got together and
talked every once in a while. I wish someone would tell
me the answer to these things. I'm really interested and
I'm always eager to learn.

  Letters
To The
E d i t 0 r

Editor, The Pitt News:

As a perfectly disinterested ob-
server I should like to say that the
attitude of Student Council in dealing
with the “League for Social Justice
affair” has probably done more to
arouse a general student interest in
the League itself than the granting
of six charters would have done.

If the League, in the normal course
of things, had been permitted to ex-
ist as an organization on this campus
it would, it seems to me, have served
the perfectly justiﬁable needs of one
interested group of students. The
rest of us would have been about as
much concerned as we now are with
the Glee club, or something equally
harmless.

But Council, by refusing to face
the issue, by refusing to even con-
sider an organization that might not
be as safe, as non-thought provoking
(and as generally insipid) as those
now existent here, has gone far to-
ward defeating its own ends.

Before all the discussion, most of
us neither knew nor cared anything
about a society called “The League
for Social Justice.” Council, by its
vague and shifting policy has created
a general feeling that the League,
whatever it is, has not been given a
fair deal.

Any column sometime or other is
bound to be like this. We all have
our off-days. Oh well, let’s get on
with it and get it over with.

To the right of the Wilkinsburg hill
on the William Penn highway is an
old golf course where they now sink
coﬁins instead of putts. It's just a
new cemetery, with only one or two
marble monuments so far. One of
them is erected on a family lot. Let
the name be “Smith” for conveni-
ence’s sake. The headstone over the
occupied grave reads: “John S., My
Husband." Now when she dies, his
wife, what’s to be put on her marker?
‘'1, His Wife,” seems to be the only
solution,

A cemetery in Big Run, Pennsylva-
nia, has a. stone with an interesting
inscription, The man's wife died
through what he thought was a care-
lessness on the part of the doctor.
He recorded his contempt for the
physician thus:

Examination Refused (Quack)

Before Operation (Quack)

12 Hours Later Marched (Quack)

Through the Room (Quack)

4 oz. of Salts Are Equal (Quack)

Midwife (Quack)

is this from a Puritan graveyard:

Pitt football victories, the hostess
committee of WSGA entertained the
students at an open house after the
Navy game last Saturday. The initial
football open house lasted ‘from 4:00

‘to 6:00 o’clock and was such a suc-

cess, that it will no doubt become
“the thing.” As the admission price
was “exactly nothing,” it helped out
a lot with the students who aren't in
the money, and who is these days?_
The hot chocolate served was hot,

Fraternities Need
More Cooperation
Says Dean Amos
Round-Table Discussions To

Feature Panhellenic
Conference Week

 

women Lacking In Spirit

“Women must begin a social rev-
olution in fraternities; an NRA
movement in fraternities is as neces-
sary as it is in the country if the
fraternities are to go forward,” said
T.hyrsa,W, Amos, dean ,of_ women, at
the opening meeting of Panhellenic
Conference Week. In comparing wo-
men’s fraternities tonational gov-
ernment, Dean Amos emphasized the
need for ﬁrst things ﬁrst.

“Women must be considered for
themselves and not for their money,
activities, scholarships or any other
one point which might make them
attractive. The cooperative spirit
must be-developed among women's
fraternities in the rushees are to be
given the advantage of choosing their
own fraternity. Fraternity women
must be broad enough to see this
need and to make those whom they
feel do not ﬁt in their particular group
acquainted with groups in which they
will ﬁt. Cooperation must be the
by-word of fraternities.

At the round-table discussion for
rushing rules chairmen, plans for
spring rushing events was the main
subject of discussion. This meeting
was under the leadership of Beatrice
Kopsofsky, C35, rushing chairman of
Panhellenic Council.

Ideal minutes and reports were the
subjects of the secretaries’ meeting,
headed by Martha Green, C35, sec-
retary of Panhellenic. The secre-
taries of the various fraternities dis-
cussed their particular difficulties and
problems in writing minutes and re-
ports.

Pledge captains under Muriel Dills,
Ed35, discussed methods of orientat-
ing pledges to the ways of the
fraternity and the ways of making
pledges and active women more co-
operative,

Watch Your P’s and Q’s
When You’re Looking
For The Birdie!

That men are much easier to pho-
tograph than women is the observa-
tion of the 0w1’s photographer,

In further explanation of the state-
ment to a News reporter, the photog-
rapher continued: “Either a man is
or isn't handsome. A woman needs
the proper setting. But since the
camera records in black and white
only, it is the person’s features which
count, not the shade of lipstick. Fur-
thermore, women are always trying
to pose, whereas a man is not even
concerned with looking like himself.

“To pose before the camera is al-
ways difﬁcult. When you feel you
have attained your most awkward
position you will probably appear
most graceful on the developed prints.
But the secret of the lovely screen
ladies is to come before the camera
in the proper frame of mind. To run
in to be photographed on your way
home from school, with a dirty face
and straggly hair, simply won't do.
There must be a feeling of expect-
ancy, a going-to-a-party air, to give
that glamorous atmosphere."

Hundred Novices
Compete In Track
 And Field Games

Twenty-two To Receive Medals,
Ribbons At Get-together
On Tuesday Evening

Garrety Heads Winners

By Charles Ruch
, One hundred freshmen and upper-
classmen novices capered around the
Stadium track Wednesday afternoon
In the second annual University of

ffittsburgh fall track and ﬁeld games.

is a result, 22 boys will be on the re-
ceiving end of one or more medals
and ribbons at the track and ﬁeld get-
Ilogether at the activities building
Tuesday night.

Standing head and shoulders above
all others was a freshman, Robert
Garrety, who hails from Ashtabula,
Ohio. Streaking along a somewhat
slow track, Gerrety clicked oﬁ the
hundred yards in 10.8 seconds to gar-
nor a. ﬁrst place. He came back to
Lake. the broad-jump event with a leap
pf 20 feet, nine inches, and his re-
"m'a‘.rkable pole vault of an even 11
feet ‘was plenty good enough to give
him his third ﬁrst place of the after-
noon.

./Close behind Gerrety were Harold

jirost. C31, and Andrew Lasky, Ed37,
ghp {captured two ﬁrsts.

_ Tost
jltole the showin the mile and two-

’ gains races, while Lasky skimmed over

‘ﬁle hurdles in both the 120-yard high-
hurdle and the 220-yard low-hurdle
affairs considerably in advance of the
rest‘ of the ﬁeld.

Two of the ﬁnest races of the meet
were the 100-yard dash and the two-
‘gnile run. The century event found
iﬂerrety and J. R. Cherico, Ed37, ﬁght-
ing it out right down to the ﬁnish
glue, with the former breasting the

’ tape just a fraction of a second ahead

gof Cherico. The gruelling two-

lmile run was a battle between Tost

fend George Cook, C36, These two
led the pack from the very start, with
-‘Tost being content to remain two
strides behind Cook for seven laps
ground the Stadium track. As the
‘gun sounded beginning the last lap,
boys hastened their pace
{and drew away from the rest of the
field. Red-headed Tost slowly crept

I -up on Cook and with 220 yards yet

“to go, the two were matching stride

A for stride at what appeared to be a

killing pace. Rounding the last turn,

4 Tost put on a ﬁnal burst which Cook

could not match and crossed the tape
ﬁrst.

In commenting upon the meet,
Coach Olson said, “To have had that
gang of fellows out there on a day
which was none too promising to
start with, is all I need in order to
can the meet a success. I know each
boy was out there giving the very
best that was in him and for that
reason I'm positive they all had a good
time of it.

This afternoon at three o'clock, the
meet will be completed with the ham-
mer throw, discus throw, javelin
throw, and 12-pound shot put. These
events will be run off at the football
practice ﬁeld.

Harriers To Meet
Miami Tomorrow

Close Competition Expected From
Last Year's Ohio Champions

Tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 o'clock,
the cross-country team will meet the
strong Miami University harriers on
the four-mile Schenley park course.

Coach Rider of Miami will bring a
real team here to test the qualities of
the Panthers, a team that last year
was Ohio state champion, and is re-
garded this year as one of the strong-
est cross-country squads in the Mid-
dle-west. They were fortunate in los-
ing but little of last year's team
through graduation, and so bring a
squad made up mostly of veterans.

Boyd, Cole, Hydeman, Taggart,
Wilkes, and Hatﬁeld will start for
Miami, while Coach Olson of the
Panthers expects to line up with the
same team that defeated Westminster
last Saturday: Waggonhouser, Wat-
kins, Albright, Lawrence, Kirkpatrick,
Cook, Musico, Loncher, and Connelly.

and give the cage sport a try. “In
fact,” said Dr. Carlson, “I’m more
concerned with having a gang of fel-
lows up there on the Stadium floor
to know each other than I am with
the fact that they are able to shoot
(only) one foul out of ﬁfty."

This is the second year of the tour-
nament and it willstart at 3:30 o'clock
Monday. Every day during the week
sessions will be held from 3:30 o'clock
to 5:30 o'clock, dealing with the
bare fundamentals and rudiments of
the game. Emphasis will be laid
mostly upon giving every fellow a
chance to play and enjoy himself.

All that is necessary for participa-
tion is ﬁlling out the entry blank
on this page and bringing it to the
Stadium at 3:30 o'clock Monday after-
noon with a basketball outﬁt, Speak-
ing of these outﬁts, Dr. Carlson says:
“The odder they are, the better. I’d
like to see every one wearing two
different colors of silk stockings, be-
cause the uniform doesn’t make the
least bit of difference. Later in the
week we intend to award a prize to
the group with the “gooﬁest” out-
ﬁts.

After the ﬁrst days the boys will
be divided into groups, or teams, Dur-

A

THIS WEEK AT THE GROTTO:

Saturday, October 21, Joe Donley
and his Virginians; Monday, Octo-
ber 23, Jack Bruce and his Show

{Boat Band. Modern dancing.

..

ing the remainder of the week these
teams will battle for the “Novice
supremacy.” As an added attraction
one day there will be a serving of
generous portions of ice cream.

“On Monday I'll be looking for the
biggest turnout of boys ever to come
out for a Pitt sport," concluded Carl-
son. “And," he added with some-
what of a twinkle in his eye, “while
we’re not expecting to uncover any
Charley Hyatts or any Don Smiths,
if we do notice any among our
novices, I think we'll know just what
to do with them."

While urging every eligible boy to
come out and enjoy himself in a week
of real collegiate sport, Carlson also
sends out a call for basketball mana-
gerial candidates.

Cheerleaders  and Band

There used to be a time when neither the band nor the cheerleader:

amounted to much, but the last few years has seen a great change in one of
these organizations, the band.

to write home about.

The Pitt band, at the present time is one of the best collegiate
organizations of its kind in thelcountry, and the recently developed
spirit among its members has tended" to mold them into a snappy
marching group that does credit to the University. Any band can

, form letters while not marching or playing, but the band that can
form GOOD letters while doing GOOD marching and playing GOOD
music is in a class by itself. The Pitt band ranks at the top, and
will undoubtedly continue the ﬁne pace it has set for itself. We doff
our borrowed hat to a good band and its ﬁne directors.

The present cheerleaders, like many of their predecessors, are nothing

A lack of unity, coupled with an apparent lack of

enthusiasm has turned the Pitt cheering section into a group resembling any-
thing but concentrated enthusiasm. Perhaps if the alleged cheerleaders
would at least TRY to work together the results MIGHT be satisfactory to

everyone.

Less attention to photographers and more to the rudiments of

yell leading could make the cheerleaders into somehing to ‘boast about,

rather than something to apologize for.

After all, cheerleaders are supposed

to see that the cheering is done at the same time, by EVERYBODY.

The best bet at the present time is to train the talented tumblers
in the cheerleading rudiments and turn them loose to do a good job.
Let's hope that the cheering problem is remedied before the next
home appearance of the gold cats.

The Gophers

When a team that is rated as highly as Minnesota's is held to two ties

in as many starts, the third team on the schedule can expect plenty of

trouble.

a

_ This is the situation confronting the Panthers in tomorrow’s game
t Minneapolis. The Gophers are victory hungry at the present time, and

the Panthers are undefeated. What a combination for an upset. Personally,

I

think the Panthers are mean enough to win tomorrow. ,
