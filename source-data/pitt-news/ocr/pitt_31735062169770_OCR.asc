Farmer, Hentoff Talk ‘Black Power’

by BILL ROSEN
Staff News Writer

-Nat Hentoff. author, lecturer.
and white liberal from New York.
and James Farmer, political lead-
er and past national director of
CORE, presented their ideas on
“Community Control” and “Black
Power” Thursday evening in the
CF auditorium to an audience of
over 300.

The program was scheduled
from 7 to 9 p.m. but due to plane
difficulties, Farmer did not ar-
rive until 7:45 p.m. As a result.
Hentoff began speaking on cum-
munity control.

Hentoff stated that since 1966.
when Stokely Carmichael invent-
ed the term black power. condi-
tions have not changed for the
blacks. Job opportunities are mov-
ing away and the ghettos are get-
ting bigger and worse. Ghetto
populations are rising at a rate
of one-half million per year.

Hentoff, citing, a recent health
report, said, “If the Bedford-
Stuyvesant areas was a separate
nation, the health conditions there
would immediately qualify it for
aid from the World Health Or-
ganization.

from all parts of the country.
Blacks realized that they must re-
spond to white institutional ra-
cism. One response has been a
thrust ‘for community control over
schools, health centers, and po-
lice.

Hentoff emphasized, “A slow
killing takes place in ghetto
schools. Of the 30,000 New York
City high school diplomas given
out in 1966, only 700 went to
black students. Furthermore, 60
per cent of these white students
went on to college whereas less
than five per cent of the blacks
continued their education.”

Becuase of these statistics, a
concept of accountability has
arisen — that is, the school’s fac-
ulty and administrators must be
responsible to members of the
communites. In this manner, com-
munity leaders, if dissatisfied
with the way their schools are be-

ing run, will have the power to

change the situation.

In Washington, D. C., and Bos-
ton. there is a strong movement
for establishing community con-
trol of schools. The Ocean-Hill-
Brownsville area in New York is
presently experimenting with the
idea.

“Community control of schools

is acting as a catalyst for com-
munity control of other _institu-
tions,” Hentoff pointed out. Cit-
izens on the Lower East Side of
New York hired an intern to run
a medical center in their com-
munity. People from the com-
munity are. trained for jobs and
the community approves all em-
ployees selected by -the intern’s
staff.

MC Constitution
To Go Into Effect

After months of discussion and
consultation, the Men’s Council
Constitution will go into effectas
soon as the selection of Judicial
Board members is completed.

The Men’s Judicial Review
Board, one of the major innova-
tions of the new constitution, will
be responsible for evaluating and
sentencing male students charged
with personal misconduct.

The six—man board 'will be
made up of members of the IFC,
CA, and MDC. They will meet
within a week of the accusation,
and will try all cases a la Perry
Mason. -

The board will have many pos-
sible actions to take upon sen-
tencing a guilty student, ranging
from a reprimanding to expulsion
from the University.

All decisions of the board will
be final unless appealed to a
higher authority.

Another important part of the
new constitution is the formation
of the Men’s Advisory Board
(MAB). This group will be re-
sponsible for the planning of ex-
tracurricular activities for male
students. as well as being a voice
to the administration. faculty and
Student Government’ on men's
welfare. , T , ’ .

  

The 15 members of the MAB
will be selected from the mem-
bership of the IFC, CA, and MDC
and will meet bi-weekly.

In a letter to the Pitt News, N.
Ronald Pease, dean’ of students.
expressed his happiness with the
new constitution, and especially

with the formation of the Judi--

cial Board.

NAT HENTOFF and James Farmer discuss “Community Control” and ‘‘Black Power.”

Hentoff stressed that political
power must follow community
control. People must make allia-
ances in voting in order to
achieve substantial political rep-
resentation.

A question was raised on how
people in the University who sup-
port the radical movement can
function in their respective de-

.partments.. In conclusion. Hent-

off replied, “If a university is not
directly involved with the city’s
problems, it is dead. Professors
should begin by refusing to give
grades, which is counter to the
notion of what learning is all
about.”

“I’ve just seen a demonstration
that black power can’t change
the weather or make planes fly
when the weather is bad,” Farm-
er amusingly began.

Farmer then proceeded to speak
on the three aspects of black pow-
er: cultural, political, and eco-
nomical;

He emphasized, “The old an-
swers are obsolete and things are
changing fast. People of the New
Deal era don’t know whatis hap-
pening in black communities.
They came out of an era of color
blindness which turned blacks
into whites.”

An example of, the ludricrous
color blind laws was the idea of
hiring the best applicant, regard-
less of color. When an employer
was asked how many black he
employed. the retort was. “How
should I know. I’m color blind.”
But-. upon inspection, it was us-
ually found that he employed
none.

Student FBI Agent

Informer Discusses Job 

by BRUCE LEVENSON
Staff News Editor

A student informer for the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation was
recently discovered and subse-
quently interviewed by The Pitt
News. He is a senior who has
been an FBI empolyee since his
freshman year.

He claims to work solely on the

 

(Editor's Note: The following letter was circulated to a limited
number of persons in the University Community from the Dean of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences David Halliday.)

Dear Friends:
E

I realize full well that I am behaving improperly in making this
ruling. However, public reaction to our resolution is justbeginning
to affect us and, as a pragmatic person, I have serious concerns about
our budget situation in Harrisburg. I have had several conversations
with Colonel Drew of the American Legion and he tells me that the
Legion is planning to recommend that the University of Pittsburgh re-

ceive no state aid in the future. This is, of course, unlikely but it sug— ‘

gests the climate in which we are operating.

I do hope that, on a personal basis if no other. you are willing to
accept this administrative ruling. Please note that something will hap-
pen next fall, namely that no student may receive credit for the basic
course; all that I’m asking for is an extension of the removal of credit
from the advanced course for those students currently enrolled in the

basic program.

 
 

Sincerely yours,

pants in the resistance movement.
His primary function is to take
down names of people in the re-
sistance, mainly draft card burn-
ers and leaders. “They want the
hard core leaders so they can be
put under surveillance, ” the agent
said.

He mentioned that he was only
one of several regular attendants
of meetings of Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS) that
reports for the FBI. “I just get
the names, the general propagan-
da, and some first hand informa-
tion at the meetings,” said the in-
former. He turns in two or three
names after each meeting the he
attends but indicated that “it’s
generally not the first time these
.names appear.”

He also related that agents pos-
ing as irameramen and reporters
have been sent to recent local
demonstrations sponsored by SDS
and other organizations. They get
photos of every face in the crowd,
file them, and check to see which
ones turn up regularly.

The informer is paid a token
sum of money for his work -— al-
ways in cash, but he admitted
that patriotism is also “a big fac-
tor.” . '

“I do get a little money,” he

_testifie,d,; “about $100 a year; ‘.1; _

Farmer then stressed ‘the resi-

dues of racism due to comic books,‘ i ’

textbooks, and Hollywood. The
only black characters encounter-

ed in these medias were janitors, ‘ ;.
maids, garbage men, or criminals . , 

—hardly the citizens to receive ad-
miration.

Upon visiting a university,
Farmer was shocked when be dis-
covered that history students were

not aware that hundreds of blacks _'_' j 

fought for their freedom on the

' Union side during the Civil War.

Farmer related these residues 0 in

of racism to the fact that every
black person confronts his own
image even if he knows it is a lie

, the superiority of whites and, _’ 

the inferiority of blacks.

Debaters Discuss

Community Control E35

(Continued from Page 1)

In the last two or three years
the emphasis has been on black
awareness. Farmer said, “Blacks
are trying to deprogram them-
selves.” They realized that they
should not feel inferior and thus
coined the expression “Black Is
Beautiful.”

Farmer pointed out that whites
are terrified at the phrase Black
Power. “Black is a negative
term,” he said, “a white lie is all
right but a black lie is bad. White
cake is called Angel Food Cake
but black cake is Devil’s Food
Cake.”

Farmer feels that the ultimate
goal for blacks is a cohesive iden-
tity that emphasizes pride in cul-

The University YWCA, spon-
sor of the Student-Faculty Lunch-
eon series, announced today that
Scott Baum, newly elected pres-
ident of Student Government, will
be featured as guest speaker at
this week’s noontime gathering.

In his new position as SG pres-
ident, Scott has pledged that his
main area of concern will focus
on “making Student Government
relevant to students.”

As a beginning towards this
goal Baum plans to discuss the is-
sues facing students at the Uni-
versity and how Student Govern-
ment might function to effective-
ly cope with these issues in the
upcoming administration. Scott
has emphasized that he would
like this Tuesday’s session to be
a two-way forum as he is eager
to hear new ideas and suggestions
from students. faculty, and ad-
ministration. Discussion begins at
12:15 p.m.

Politically, victories in Civil
Rights movements have not alter-
ed the average black’s life.

Farmer sees two levels of pow-
er that can change the situation.
One is financially hurting the
whites by boycotting and picket-
ing their stores. The other is by
block voting — voting for the man.
not the party, who offers them
the best solutions to their prob-
lems.

Farmer believes that past riot-
ing was not due to unemployment
or bad housing. Rather, it was a
reaction against the fact that
blacks had very little control over
the communities that they lived
in, They did not (and still do not)
own.their own homes, businesses.
or much income producing_pro—
perty.

In response to a question on
why blacks have waited a hun-
dred years, Farmer anwered,
“Before, blacks were spread out
over the South; today they are
city dwellers and identity and or-
ganizations comes quickly. Since
World War II, blacks have seen
an increasing amount of racism.
Also, the Supreme Court Civil
Rights Decision of 1954 set up a
legal framework for change.”

Farmer concluded his address
by saying that the present objec-
tive of blacks is to check racism.
He said, “We don’t want whites
to love us — we want them to re-

Pitt News Analysis

by MICHAEL EDELSTEIN
Staff News Writer

“Is the way to stop a keg of
dynamite from explodingto sit
heavily on the lid?”

It was billed as a debate, but
the second speaker reiterated the
plan of the first. And what Nat
Hentoff factually suggested,
James Farmer dramatically drove
home: the idea that the black man
in America must be given control
over his own destiny so that he
can develop a sense of identity
and participate in American so-
ciety with a sense of efficacy.

This writer achieved political
awareness at a time when the
goal of the civil rights movement
was integration. My heroes were
Schwerner, Chaney and Good-
man. It was thus with initial
skepticism that I met Farmer’s at-
tempt to justify a move toward
separatism. ‘

But the former CORE leader
did such a masterful job of en-
veloping the audience in the fu-
tility of trying to be a “white
man with invisible black skin,”
in the dissonance caused when
one lets himself relegated to an
inferior status without protest,
and in the insecurity one feels
when he lacks identity, that I
laughed with the audience as
Farmer anecdotally destroyed the
ideaof integration.

To Farmer, the important thing
now is for the black man to say
“Black is Beautiful” and to ac-
quire the ethnocentricity oth'er
minorities have. Once he reaches
this point. he will be equal. He can
-make ad hoc alliances with other
groups and wield power to check-
mate racism. This power will
come when the black man’s vote
“is not in anybody’s
Farmer called for the use of “bal-
lots as bullets” in the war to gain
recognition. The power is espe-
cially important in the opinion of
both Farmer and Hentoff in com-
munity control of schools. medi-
cal facilities and even police.

This writer finds it most grati-

_ fying that the speakers advocate

the use of the “system” to bring
change. It is the fear that those
desiring change will bypass the
“system” that often brings “back-
lash.” However. the BAS—compu-
tor center incident at Pitt is a
case in point that such action also
brings results. It was in this con-

bag.”

y, That’s Dynamite!

text that Farmer said, “God bless
the militants, without them we
would have stood still or taken a
step backwards.”

With the idea of community
control comes the "problem of
others involved in the commun-
ity. The Ocean-Hill-Brownsville
strike resulted in a sense of com-
munity among the blacks and ha-
tred of the conflicting group, in
this case the predominantly Jew-
ish United Federation of Teach-
ers. Because many black areas
were formally Jewish, there is ad-
ditional conflict because Jewish
merchants are often still in busi-
ness in the black areas. The same
is true of other minorities in con-
tact with the black communities,
but the press and the teacher’s
strike have given an anti-semite
label to what Mr. Farmer termed‘
“anti-white” feelings.

Both men felt that the widely
acclaimed black capitalism would
do little to solve the problems of
the ghetto. Along with redistribu-
tion of wealth under a Guarran—
teed Annual Income (GAT). Hen-
toff proposes a community cor-
poration to buy out white busi-
nesses in the ghetto and sell them
back to black communities cor-
porations. It is here that the ques-
tion of the white merchants be-
comes relevant. As one white girl
commented to.me, “My father’s
been in business in.a ghetto all
his life. Is he suddenly going to
be made to give up his business?”

Although I agree that black
capitalism is not the whole an-
swer. I wonder if guarranted in-
come will provide the self-respect
the black wants. The solution, in
this writer’s_opinion, must lead to
the black’s involvement in com-
munity and national life. I don’t
see how the GAI will do this (uni.
less proper incentives are also
guarranteed). However, if the dis-
engagement of whites and blacks
will lead _to hard feeling, as in
the case, of the long-established
merchant, the need for diplom-
acy and patience is apparent.

Whether or not the proposed
system of community control and
segregation is the answer, it seems
apparent to this writer that pre-
vious methods have not done the
job. There were no riots this sum-
mer, according to Hentoff, not be-
cause the blacks are focusing

their attention on control of their ‘

local institutions. There will be

-1 -/In a letter of limited circulaton,
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sci-
ences David Halliday made an admin-
istrative ruling extending the removal
of "academic credit from the advanced
course of ROTC “for those students
currently enrolled in the basic pro-
gram. This decision is a reaction to
pressure emanating from the “moral”
halls of the American Legion.

Such a decision, in our view, has
serious implications for the University
« community. As an institution, we have,
-to an‘ extent, wilted in the presence of
the Legion. This is a serious set back
" ‘ in the battle for institutional autonomy.

The reasoning behind the Halliday
decision reveals a clear lack of Uni-
versity confidence and strength. “I
‘realize full well,” Dean Halliday says,
_ “that I am behaving improperly in
_ ‘making this ruling. However, public
 reactions to our resolution is just be-
 ginning to affect us and, as a prag-
matic person, I have serious concerns
r  about our budget situation in Harris-
burg.”
Dean Halliday points to his sever-
ft‘ al conversations with the American‘
 '.Legion’s Col. Daniel Drew. But he ad-
 mits that implementation of Drew’s
 7 - Legion resolution is unlikely. Halliday’s
  fear, it seems, is “the climate in which
  we are operating.” ‘
I The climate in which we are op-
'-erating is indeed hostile. Outside
{groups are attempting to dictate Uni-
 versity policy. And if Dean Halliday’s
 decision is valid evidence, outside
 . groups, like the American Legion, are
~ ‘having some success. This success, in
 '0 our view, is a clear prostitution of our
’  academic ideals. -

        Student

. It has been brought to our attention
. , recently that a few seniors have been
 working as agents for the FBI during
 ‘ their four years here. These students

 t. ‘or mail in their draft cards and are
 ;  then paid by the FBI for the names.

3-:_:;.'%, , ' One of the agents noted that there
 ~ ‘is strong‘ evidence that there are up to
»  425 other agents in the freshman class
' , alone who could receive up to $1,000
 I . for names of drug users or pushers.
 , Although the administration will
 }. j. probably deny any knowledge of these
 actions, The Pitt News urges imme-
 , odiate action by the administration for
  "the safety of those students at the Uni-
" versity who must be exposed daily to
the underhanded tactics ‘of the FBI
a_nd a group of students who have been
. bought out in exchange for a clean
A record and suspension of fines and/or
jail terms they earned before ever
coming to the University.

This editorial does not intend to
condone the use of drugs or the des-
truction of draft cards, but does chal-

_ lenge the use of student agents in a
j » - free academic community where open

" and free thinking is supposed to be
.-  encouraged.

. _ at V, Students should also keep the fact
r  in mind that their names could very
I A f  easily be turned in by their best friends"

      

Halliday Decision

To make matters worse, the Halli-
day decision, if we can really call it

that, was made without consultation

of the faculty. This is, in Dean Halli-
day’s words, “behaving improperly.”
The ROTC resolution was passed by
the Faculty of the College of Arts and
Sciences. Consequently, any amend-
ments to that initial resolution should
be made by that same faculty body,
not Dean Halliday and other members
of the administrative hierarchy. The
members of the faculty should feel in-
sulted. Some of their representative
decision-making power has been
usurped. ’

The administration of the Univer-
sity is wilting in presence of that aca-
demically “tuned in” group, the Amer-
ican Legion. Can the faculty of this
institution sit in their soft secure aca-
demic chairs and accept this weak-
ness? Can the faculty of this Univer-
sity. digest an administrative decision
bastardizing their own resolution?

There is much more at stake here
than budgetary - problems in Harris-
burgh. This institution will not be
worth the grime and dirt that covers
its buildings if we of the academic
community allow the American Le-
gion and that majority of half-wits,
the Pennsylvania State Legislature, to
influence and dictate internal Univer-
sity policy.

This newspaper is shocked and dis-
mayed with the Halliday decision.
And we urge the members of the fac-

ulty to overrule this “pragmatic move”

in the name of academic freedom.“
Passivity is not the quality needed in
this situation. It is time for those of us
in the academic community to raise
our voices, not lower them.

Agents

at any time for any illegal actions,
ranging from demonstrations against
the war in Vietnam to drug usage. Any
information about student agents
should be made public at the earli-
est possible moment for the safety
of all students at the University.

Any knowledgeable silence by ei-
ther the administration or students is
considered by the Pitt News to be
even more serious than the Gestapo-
type of tactics presently being used
by the FBI.

It is no wonder that students in to-
day’s academic community challenge
the validity of the society into which
they will someday move. When the
FBI cannot take action against known
Mafia members who have now moved
in and cornered the drug market, and
yet trade fines or jail terms to young
students for information about their
fellow students, some pertinent ques-
tions about the police action in our so-
ciety must be raised.

These questions about society will
be dealt with when students move into
that society, but while they attend
Universities, a certain academic en-
vironment must be insured by the ad-
ministrators. This free environment is
being infringed upon by the FBI, and
their actions must be halted immedi-
ately. . ‘ l “

Last winter the Council of the Faculty
Senate directed its Students Affairs Com-
mittee to study criticism of ROTC. After
study , the committee recommended" that
the ROTC programs should be offered as
voluntary extra-curricular activities which
carry no academic credit and the use of
academic titles for instructors of ROTC
courses should either be discontinued or
modified by the use of the word “clinical”
as a prefix. This recommendation was tak-
en to the Senate Council May 13 and they

voted to adopt the recommendation with,

minor modifications. After this meeting
the administration took the first of several
actions to prevent changes in ROTC by
faculty action. The responsibility for
ROTC was placed under the Provost’s jur-
isdiction who announced that neither the
Senate Council nor the‘Senate were appro-
priate bodies to deal with either the ques-
tions of course credit or faculty rank. In-
stead _both were referred to the undergrad-
uate schools concerned.

The Cabinet of Arts and Sciences then
reaffirmed the original ‘action of the Sen-
ate Council. The administration next ruled
that this was also not the group to decide,
rather power was now said to be with a
faculty body called the Undergraduate
Councilof Arts and Sciences.

Before the Undergraduate Council
completed its work the administration
ruled that it could deal only with the
course credit and that the question of titles
was for the Senate and Senate Council
where it had begun in the first place. The
Undergraduate Council ‘voted, like those
groups before it, to remove academic cred-
it. Next Dean Halliday ruled that it must
be decided by the full Faculty of Arts and
Science. One may speculateas to whether
the question would have ever reached
them had any of the previous four groups
voted to retain credit. The Faculty of Arts
and Sciences which had never met before
or since, met Dec. 4 and voted by 106 to
81 the following policy: “I hereby move
that this faculty award no academic cred-
it for ROTC courses, except that any stu-
dent currently enrolled in either a basic
or advanced program may complete that
program with credit as currently granted.”

THE ARGUMENTS for this policy
presented in the debate were that of ex-
ternal control of the curriculum, the fact
that ROTC staff, as military officers, are

For anyone who is interested. the fourth
issue of Alternatives will never make it
to the presses. Even though the adminis-

tration has been involved in the usual BS‘

rationalizations, the fact remains that
this particular issue of the paper will nev-
er appear.

The fourth issue of Alternatives was
supposed to go the press during last tri-
mester’s finals week. When Beers decided
that he didn’t want to print the famous
words, the administration knew that they
would only have to stall until winter break
for the issue to die because of topicality
loss. They came out with all the familiar
verbiage to disguise the well—known fact
that news is news for only a short period
of time.

Much has been said about Beers’ right
to exercise his individual freedoms by re-
fusing to print the objectionable words.
It seems strange, or not so strange, that
people like Esther Kitzes call it “freedom”
when Beers is able to express his opinion
will supress the ideas contained in Alter-
natives. If Beers objected to the words,
he should have written a letter or article
relating his views on the topic.

IF BEERS HAD undertaken this ac-
tion, we would have had the “freedom”
that Montgomery, Posvar, and Kitzes have
been shooting their mouths off about. It
would have been possible to hear the opin-
ion of Beers as well as the ideas contained
in Alternatives.

What occurred in this case is a perfect

_‘ example of how the‘ad_ministration‘ sup-

primarily responsive to a’discipline from
outside the University, and that the role
of the ROTC curriculum and staff is one
of recruitment for the regular and reserve
forces using the course instruction and
and coursecredit as a portion of that re-
cruitment activity. Among the supporters
of the motion. there was, I’m happy to say,
little discussion on professionalism, aca-
demic merit of courses of qualifications of
instructors. The vote would seem to have
finally and unequivocally settled the mat-
ter but the newspapers the next day indi-
cated that there could be curriculum re-
form of some kind. What the press was
told, but omitted, was that this reflected
the provost’s thinking rather than the new
policy actually adopted by the faculty.

The administration’s next move, an ad
hoc committee was appointed by Halliday
on the already decided ROTC question-
what it is to do is unclear, but its chair-
man has received communication from the

-provost suggesting the possibility of cur-

curiculum reform_ for ROTC. Then Jan.
22, the letter published on the front page
was prepared by Halliday.

Are we to sacrifice principle with each
change in the “climate” or on demand of
each weak lobbying interest?’Of course,
not. This ruling must be viewed against
the background of administration moves
to thwart faculty action on ROTC. A
flimzy excuse has been seized upon to
override the faculty. That the threat by
Col. Drew should be taken seriouly is ab-
surd. And Dean Halliday’s very forthright
letter admits the unlikelihood of Col.
Drew making good his threat.

THAT IS WHERE course credit issue
stands at this time. and the question of
academic rank is still stalled after being
waylaid by Provost Peake. There is one
interesting contrast. however. In May,
1967, the University signed a new contract
with the Air Force which changed the
AFROTC from a two year program to a
four year program. There was, as near as I
can tell, no discernable discussion among
the faculty or even knowledge that such a
step was being taken. '

The administration seems to initiate
new programs, such as upper level
AFROTC, without faculty review and is

prepared to obstruct faculty action, or u

even overrule the faculty in the very areas
generally assumed to be faculty responsi-
bility-— degree requirements and faculty
appointment. The insult is doubled by
claiming to do so for the American Le-
gion.

presses an issue by usingdiversionary tac- ’

tics. They said that they really didn't cen-
sor the paper because they offered to have
someone else print it. They point with
prideto the fact that six printers refused
to print Alternatives. They also point, with
the same finger, that the University is a
community of free expression.

According to Wesley’s own words, the
University supports the idea of a free
press; then why did the University refuse
to print the isse. The guise of Beers’ indi-
vidual conscience has been hiding the fact
that Central Printing is part of the Univer-
sity and it was Central Printing that re-
fused its facilities to Alternatives.

THIS WAS NOT the act of one man;
it was the act of the University._The fourth
issue of Alternatives will never appear be-
cause the administration carried out their
stall long enough to kill it. It was another
of their many lies.

I am glad to report, however, that Al-

ternatives has found someone to print their‘ ‘

paper, so this distressing tactic cannot be
repeated. The “New Fourth Issue” will be
appearing shortly, and let me warn you
now that it is full of obscenities, dirty
pictures, and a three section nude photo
of the Cathedral with the staples in the
12th floor.

S0 for you pious readers out there, take
my advice and don’t read it. It will dis-
gust you, turn your stomach, and make you
puke. And just remember that if you do
read it, you can only blame yourself. 01’
Uncle Dave tried to warn you. And I know

' you wouldn’t want Alternatives not to ap-
1 pear just becuase you find it objectionable. oi.

24 years old and has a keen aware-
ness of student interests.

Markus climbed out from be-
hind his desk and sat down next

of the interview. “Ken (Schueler)

has done a great deal to provide
for more significant student in-
volvement,” Markus said in giv-
ing his evaluation of the past SG
administration. Markus cited the
student representation on the Fac-
ulty Senate Committees as evi-
dence but indicated that Schuel-
er’s last two proposals “were pass-
ed by a lame duck Senate.”

“It’s up to Scott Baum to carry

the ball now,” Markus conclud-

ed. “Perhaps Scott will take a dif-
ferent approach altogether to the
student involvement porblems. ”

On the subject of the Under-
graduate Council, Markus said,
“The Chancellor has encouraged
the academic deans to recognize
student needs in areas like cur-
riculum, books, etc,. It is logical
the institution is moving in this
direction. because how do you de-
termine the needs of theilearner
without student feedback?”

Markus awakened at 6:30 on.
the morning of the Speak Your
Peace Conference and drove ten
miles to take part in the session.
“If you determine success by
number, the program clearly fail-
ed,” he said. “There was an hon-

est attempt on the part of the fac- ,

ulty to step away from their desks
into neutral ground to hear what

‘The micro-lab is an_ attempt to bring people

and game situations in which one relates without
the crutch of traditional roles and expectations. It
is on the order of sensitivity training and the co-

tion to the dynamics of sensitivity groups.

It will be run by Lee Bolman and Joel Goldstein,

(Editor's Note: This is the first
of a two part series on “Student
‘-RestIessness.")

Recent, controversies surround-
_ing various issues on our campus

sive heat and passion if they were

Against the Ivy Wall: A History
of the Columbia Crisis . . .). until
I was in possession of a sizeable
file (which I still keep). With its
help I gained a valuable insight
into the nature of the rebellion
and into student restlessness gen-
erally. My conclusions correspond
roughly with those _o_f__lyI_a_rgaret
Mead,‘ the noted anthropologist, in
her article, _“The Wider Signifi-
cance of the Columbia Upheaval”
(Columbia Forum, Fall, 1968).
According to her, “the events at
Columbia mark the end of a very
long epoch during which students
have been treated as wards of
academic institutions, a position
which joins special controls with
special privileges and immuni-
ty from the civil authorities.”
Under such a system, the uni-
versity acts toward the students
in loco parentis; in return for the
continued protection and teach-
ing, students are expected to sur-
render part of their freedom as
young adults. “It is against this
anomalous status (while the
whole face of the United States is
changing) that students are dem-
onstrating and rioting, although
the causes of rioting are various-
ly -defined: demands for the ad-
mission of members of minority
groups; against dismissal or re-
tention of a professor; against
classes on Good Friday; against
the presence of Dow Chemical;
against recruiting for the Marines
(or ROTC); or just “general dis-
content.”

- In this state of discontent, dis-
turbances are triggered by any
slight episode or by the organ-
ized disruptive behavior of small
groups of the left or right. And
every institution in. this country
is ripe for some kind of disorder.
The disorder turns into a crisis
when the university revokes its
traditional claim to protect and
discipline its own students and
calls in the police. A compact as
old as the university system is
broken and a confrontation devel-
ops. This is exactly what .happen—
ed at Columbia. “Students were
treated as ordinary disrupters of
peace, trespassers, vandals, de-
spoilers of private property,
breakers and enterers, and this at
the initiation of the university au-
thorities. This -provoked outraged

accusations" of incredible brutal-

ity.»”- ‘Although there were few

this sense of outrage at a broken
compact. A
But the compact needs to be
broken, even at a cost of a minor
crisis. Students must learn to be
responsible adults. Those who
don’t must pay the penalty. Uni-
versitites across the country are
increasingly urged to expell stu-
dents fomenting revolts (New

. York Times, Nov. 12, 1968). On

the other hand, students should

‘be given a voice in shaping their

future ‘careers. If they are not,
new crises will develop. Although
I do not share Professor Hofstad—
ter’s apocalyptic’ vision of a ma-
jor crisis, I nevertheless agree
with him that “for every crisis
. . . there has to be s_ome construc-
tive response.” At Columbia, the
constructiveresponse has been a
call for university reform.

About "university reform, cer-

tain guiding principles ought to be-,

observed. Politics should not be a
consideration. .In the words of Dr.
Richard B. Morris, the historian,
“American universitites should

_never be politicized, whether by

radicals or by conservaties, for as
the German universities under
the Nazis proved, apolitical uni-
versity is a university doomed”
(New York Times, De(_:_.__15,_ 1968). M

The question should be ap-
proached primarily in terms of
academic merit. Long before the
Columbia crisis, educators across
the nations have been concerned
with the changing nature of the
American university and its func-
tion and place in society, A term
commitment of the modern uni-

’ versity to public service) has been

coined by Clark Kerr, during his
tenure as president of the Univ-
versity of California. James A.
Perkins, president of Cornell, has
likened the modern university to
a triangle with equal sides—teach-
ing, research and public service.

  

  

\

 

The issue, he said, is not whet_h_eL
to‘ eliminate any one,’l_)ut_how to
keep the three in balance and
perspective (New York Times
November 3, 1968). This is the
crux of the problem.. Because
while the university is getting
bigger and more involved in pub-
lic service, while the faculty is
getting more engaged in re-
search and outside committments,
the primary function of the uni-
versity, teaching, suffers, and the
most important ingredient of the
university, the student, is neglect-
ed.

These facts were pointed out by
Jacques Barzun, a leading scho-
lar and critic of higher educa-
tion, who charged that American
universities had destroyed them-
selves by turning into “a public

' utility” (Dr. Barzun made his re-

marks at a news conference that
introduced his new book, The Am-
erican University — How It Runs,
Where It Is Going). While op-
posing the demands to give stu-
dents new powers in the manage-
ment of ‘the universities, he said
the sympathized with them as‘ the
victims of. “increasingly poor
teaching or nonteaching or idioti-
cally . p_rofessional (specialized)
teaching where they wanted or
expected a liberal education,”
this’ he added. is what “the stu-
dent can and should raise the roof
about.” (New ‘York Times, Oc-

tober 25, 1968).. Dr. Barzun’s cri- I

ticism of “activist universities”
provoked a rebuttal by Dr. Kerr,

Where Barzun saw the universit-
ies in self-inflicted decline, Kerr
described thecampus of 1968, de-
spite its upheavals, as much better

than that of 1.0 ‘years ago — ready ~

for its mission to provide service
‘-‘-to the_ cities, the lower classes
and the poor” (New York Times,
October 31,1968).

The argument then seems to be
between the Barzun-type and Kerr-
type university and, for the mo-

ment, the Kerr argument seems in
ascendancy. But while it admit-
tedly accommodates some stu-
dent activists, it does leave the

moderates and the bulk of uncom-
mitted students further removed

from the center of the uniVersity’s

concern than ever before. Needless
to say, this is a major (but not the

only one) source of discontent

among the students, who are

hankering for participation. The

ideal situation would be some-

thing in the middle — not only a

middle between the Kerr and Bar-

zun arguments, but a happy me-

dium inwhich the three forces

(students, faculty and adminis-

tration) could live in harmony.

In recent months there have
been many newspaper and maga-
zine articles on just how to
achieve it. The most progressive
of them, “The System Really

Isn’t Working,” by Dr. Judson-

Jerome of Antioch College (Life,
November 1, 1968), calls for a
radical change in the existing
curriculula and their replace-
ment by education “relevant to
real human concerns.” It would
involve abolishing many of the
required course programs (”resul—
ting from theneed to populate
courses taught by teachers with
tenure”) and substituting them
-with informal courses dictated
by social needs and student in-
terest. Another article, “A Dif-
ferent Way to Restructure the
University,” by Irving Kristol
(The New York Times Magazine,
Dec. 8, 1968), calls for students
to finance their own education
with student loans into which all
public funds for education would
be channelled. “It means
that students will have more of
the only kind of ‘student power’
that counts: the freedom to-pur-

. chase the kind of education they

want, on terms acceptable to
them.” If students paid for their
own education, “there would cer-
tainly be less casual or playful
disruption . . . . . ”

Cuba

(Editor's Note: This is Part Two
of a three part series begun on
Jan.3l.)

Mr. Campina described some of
the circumstances and events lead-
ing to the establishment of the
current Castro regime, and his
personal role in these struggles.

“Batista came to power in a
bloodless coup d’etat. Your per-
sonal freedom was not limited. Of
course, Batista ruled absolutely.
and it was not good to be caught
working against him.”

Campina related with a smile
that “I myself engaged in some
‘orderly’ activities against Batis-
ta,” but explained that this had
not included “terrorist activities
like bombings.” He added that he
was “not a part of the 26-de—Julio
Movement.”

Campina recounted that Castro
had fought and won his revolution
mainly with money and propagan-
da:

“‘The New York Times, Coro-
net, even Bohemian, one of our
national magazines in Cuba. went
into the hills to interview Fidel.
All he offered was ‘honest govern-

A

ment’ and ‘elections every three
or four years’ . . . He (Castro) got
three million dollars cash from
cattle barons, et cetera, which en-
abled him to buy the (Batista’sl
army for $20,000. Also at that time.
labor unions did not follow Cas-
tro. There was a boycott against
new cars; they said anyone who
bought one would be bombed.”

“I left the Underground in
1960.” said Campina. “because I
became what is called ‘hot.’ (At
the time) I knew two or three peo-
ple; it was a chain. It took me two
or three years to make a mistake.”
When Castro came to power, Cam_--
pina related", many of the men who
had foughtwith him in the Sier-
ra Maestra were shocked at his al-
legiance to the Communist Par-
ty and Russia. Campina indicat-
ed that many of these same men
were later “the easiest to persuade
to join the Bay of Pigs invasion.”
Campina continued to work as
Budget Director for Castro for
one year. whileparticipating ac-
tively in the underground—move-
ment to overthrow Castro. He dis-
credited the popular stereotype of

Campina Raps Batista Ruler”

sterious cloak -and-dagger hero.
“It is merely living a double life.
and a verylunpopular one,” he
said. “I was hated by many who
thought my loyalties were with
Castro, and vice-versa.” Campina
said that while he lived his dou-
ble life, he found the “Cuban
middle class, of working men”
most responsive and co-operative
to the underground movement.
while “white collar office work-
ers“ were “a bad class to Contact
or rely on.” Campina and others
were also angered at the blood-
shed and imprisonment that were

rampant-when Castro took over; .7

“There were 125,000 people in
jail. Supermarkets were made into
jails.” ’

Campina was most shocked
when, he related, he was work-
ing on the government budget and
came across “a fund of a million
and a half dollars which I didn’t
know where to allocate.” At this
point Capina made an appoint-
ment with a superior, who told
him that the fund was expressly
for “the overthrow of the capital-

the underground agent asa my— _ist governments of Latin Amer-

ica.”

by JOE ANDERSON
Staff Entertainment Editor

Occasionally one record will
appear on the market which
shakes everyone up and sends
even the most sedentary ears
a-rockin’. But seldom is the
case now do three such albums
show up at once. The Creedence
Clearwater Revival — Bayou Coun-
try (Fantasy-8387) The Live Ad-
ventures of Mike Bloomfield &
Al Kooper (KGP-6) and Spirit —
The Family That Plans Together
(Z12 44014) are each in their
own rights extraordinary albums.

Bayou Country is probably the
best and most consistant of the
lot. The Creedence Clearwater
Revival are deep into Cajun
blues with all its voodo charm
and mystical fetish. It’s hard
Rock all around with no excuses
and few compromises. Of course
Blues is the medium but not just
urban souffle but real electric
rock salt.

John Fogerty, lead vocalist of
the Revival, has the most convin-
cing Delta blues drag that I’ve
heard since the early recordings
of Robert Johnson. If it’s neces-
sary to pick favorite “Graveyard
Train” and “Proud Mary” are
mine.

,F'

Whereas the Clearwater Re-
vival are best catalogued as
primitive urban blues, the work
of Al Kooper and Mike Bloom-
field can only be characterized
as “intellectual blues.” This is
done only out of consideration
and respect for Bloomfield &
Kooper’s genius as musicians. For
once, on the Live Adventures Al-
bum, Al Kooper decided to for-
get his usual afterthought of ad-
ding horn arrangements. The re-

sult is the best collection of the
now famous Bloomfield-Kooper
jam sessions available. It’s hard
to imagine such a tight and flaw-
less album coming out of just
four days of rehearsals.

On drums is ex-Pauper Skip
Prokop whose drum phrasing
here is very well executed and
never gets sloppy or carried
away. Being a live album and a
jam session at that the songs
could have gotten caught up in a
lot of monotonous improvisation
which is fine for the musicians
but hard on an audience. Such is
not the case though for Kooper
knows exactly where he wants
things to go and in the end every-
there.

Spirit plays head music which
mears just about anything you
want it to. Their material shows
quite a variety of style which
usually isn’t the case with a
group like the Revival, The
Family that Plays Together was
everything from folk-rock ballads
like “Silky Sam,” through the
obsidian rock barrage of “I Got
a Line On You” to the delicate,
tough and go of “Darlin If” Re-
markably enough, the Spirit hand-
les each form with amazing accur-
acy and understanding. One fail-
ing is “All the Same” in which the
group tries to lay down some real-
ly raunchy music but succeeds in
only making so much noise. I us-
ually don’t like to quote a lot
of lyrics unless they’re import-
ant to the album as a whole, but
these from “Silky Sam” just struck
me as being particularly good.

“Silky Sam was a joke telling
man.

and you laugh just to be at his
side.

Two other albums which
caught my attention and at

Grapefruit is interesting mostly
because it sounds so much like

songs like “Another Game,”

few mud pie songs like “C’M0n

Establishes
Library

Last December the Process ’69
Group Against White Racism set up
a library on white racism, black
history, and black culture. With
funds provided by the University
YWCA, the group purchased 23
books including Soul in Ice, Black
Rage, Black Skin White Masks,
Malcolm X Speaks, Home, The
Black Muslims in America and
Black Power, and is planning to
expand its selection.

The books are located in the
Counseling Center Library, 205
SU. It is open to the public as well
as the university community.
There are magazines which can be
used in the library, and books can
be taken out for one week, wi-th
a 10 0 per day overdue fine. A
Pitt ID card or some other identi-
fication is required to borrow
books.

Discussion groups on some of
the books will be formulated if
students show an interest. All
interested students can sign up
at the Pitt YWCA office, 210

WROAC Created
To Insure Rights

This is the first of three articles by Sharon Nelson and Elinor Scherl
aimed at giving the recipient's point of view on what is wrong with the
welfare system and what can be done about it.

Welfare rights — just a phrase? Maybe. The welfare Rights Organiz-

ation of Allegheny County (WROAC) doesn’t think so. WROAC is a group
of people who think that receiving a welfare check does not make you

ineligible for human rights.

Mr. Henry is one of those people who knows what it’s like to be de-
prived of those rights, to have his car, his house, his insurance, and

all other assets taken away for
$323 a month. Why? So that each
recipient is equal —- equally needy.
Where does the money go? Into
the welfare budget, not to pay the
recipients’ debts.

What is the significance of this?
First, recipients do contribute to
the welfare budget. Second, the
debts still have to be paid when
recipients leave the welfare roll.

Mr. Henry has contributed his
share to the budget, and his debts
have yet to be paid. In 1964 Mr.
Henry, an insurance executive
making $10,000 a year, was
forced to go on welfare. Social
pressures and the strain of trying
to support eight children and a
wife resulted in a nervous break-
down. 2

After several months of not
working, the Henry’s were finally
forced to seek aid. The welfare
department collected what it

could after Mr. Henry’s assets
were liquidated. This money could
have been applied to his $10,000
debt. He feels that he had “been
taken into an alley and been given
a financial beating.”

Mr. Henry also feels that each
month he is on welfare, his family
goes farther and farther downhill
and finds it harder and harder to
keep up the few things they have.

The caseworker, who could be
the recipient’s greatest help,
too often hides behind adminis-
trative red tape. In addition, the
caseworker often fails to inform
the recipient of his rights.

Mr. Henry’s daughter, who
wished to go into practical nurs-
ing, worked as a receptionist at
Montefiore Hospital, making
$200 a month so that she could
go to school. The welfare depart-
ment, considering this as part of
the family income, decreased
the monthly check by $67 and in-
creased the rent by $27. She was
able to save $400 in five months,
but only through great sacrifice
by the family. When she was laid
off. she reapplied for welfare;
but she was required to use up all
her savings before she would be
eligible.

It was only after she was back
on welfare, that Mr. Henry learn-
ed how they had been misinform-
ed. a VISTA worker explained that
she had the right to a trust fund
for educational purposes. Her
savings could have been $1003. ~

It was this incident that con-
vinced Mr. Henry of the need for
WROAC. Since September he has
been extremely active in WROAC
to insure that others are inform-
ed of their rights. He also hopes
that through WROAC increased
recipient participation will lead
to a better system.

 Tackle Maryland;  
Seek Second Dual Victory

by MARTHA HARTLE

 With a big win over Clarion behind them, the matmen will
.be‘ out to make it two straight tomorrow night when they take
on a powerful squad from the University of Maryland in the

;,Field House at 7 :30.

' Maryland comes into the match with an awesome line-up and an

.’only one meet so far this season
and that one was to Iowa State,

23-12. Iowa State is ranked num-

ber two in the nation. The twelve
"points which Maryland scored
against the Iowans is the highest

that an opponent has registered

against them all year.

“I’d say that Maryland is every
bit, as good a team as Navy at this
point,” commented‘ wrestling

[mentor Dave Adams. (Navy is
_ranked number one in the East

and. -has already defeated the
grapplers.) “Their line-up is full
of outstanding boys,” he continu-
ed.

Included in the Maryland line-
up are two boys who have already
gained national recognition. John

4 Baker, a 123 pounder, was a na-

tional prep school champion at St.
Benedicts in New York. Boble
Cline, a Pennsylvania native, plac-

V ed third inthe NCAA mat tour-
_‘ my last year. The 152-pounder
A is undefeated thus far this season.

night. Payne tackles Curt Callahan.

whose only loss this season came
at the hands of last year’s nation-
al champ from Iowa State. Calla-
han is a native of Wilkinsburg,
Pa. Cindrich goes against unde-
feated Ralph Santag, a 6’4”, 250-
pound heavyweight.

“This will be one of Cindrich’s
toughest matches,” explains Ad-
ams. Santag is a real fine heavy-
weight. ,

Maryland also boasts a fine
130 pounder. Dave Reese, an-
other Pennsylvania native, has lost
only one match this season and
that was against an "Iowa State
opponent. Reese has already de-
feated Leheigh’s Pete Henning,
who is considered to be one of
the finest 130 pounders in the
East. “Dave has really come into
his own this year,” comments
Adams.

Reese will go against Larry Cu-
ba, varsity co-captain who is cur-
rently undefeated since moving
down to 130.

Seven Firsts,

Few surprises, some record-
breaking performances, and
close competition made Pitt’s\
First Annual Track Classic,
Saturday, the success Jim
Banner had hoped for. His
trackmen, too, found the meet

to be to their liking.
The thinclads didn’t com-
pletely control the Classic,

but they did do well enough to

be considered the unofficial win-

ner in the “individual’s” meet.

They grabbed seven first places,

five seconds, and four thirds com-

pared to West Virginia’s (unoffic-

ially in second place) three firsts

and three thirds. Kent State was
the only other squad to capture

more than one top spot.

tracksters. Jerry Richey broke the
varsity mile record, clocking in
at 4210.8. In, then, came back as
a member of the two-mile relay
team that erased two records. The
quartet of Dick Werner, Mike
Nolan, Richey, and John Aiken
finished that race in 7:45.7 easily
surpassing the old varsity and

, Field House standards. Aiken turn-

ed in one of the best performan-
ces of the day in that race, run
ning his half-mile in 1:53.

The final mark of the day was
set by Larry Long of Slippery
Rock who leaped 23’ 1‘/2” for the
new Field House long jum p
record.

No major upsets were able to
take shape, but one almost did.
The favored Reg Corbett of West
Virginia cleared 14’ in the pole
vault to win his medal. But, not
before Steve Winter of Delaware

. and the varsity’s Jeff Snyder gave

him a scare. Winter finished sec-
ond and Snyder third after mis-
sing at 14’.

Banner mentioned, “We knew
Corbett would win. But, Jeff
looked real good. He was up and
over “14” twice; he just couldn’t
get the push.”

Another close battle came in
the 440-yd. dash. Wally Swiger
won this one with a time of 50.2,
while his thinclad teammate, Rudy
Hufnagel, was close behind with
a 50.4 finish. Bill Kearns 50.5 of
WVU was third.

This, however, was not the
closet race of the day. Kent’s Or-
in Richberg came very close to
missing his usual 50-yd dash win.
Dave Garnett of Pitt was less than
a tenth of a second behind Rich-
berg’s 5.4 finish. WVU’s Tim Kel-
ley was third in the chase with a
5.5 time.

Another favorite, Smitty Brown
had an easy time in the “600”.

JEFF SNYDER

had the crowd behind him, hop-
ing he would once again smash
his own mark of 1:11.1 in this
chase. -

“It’s nice to hear them and to
know there’s some one support-
ing you,” he said.

Smitty heard the crowd a sec-
ond time, Saturday, when he an-
chored the mile relay team on to
victory. He had a pretty big
lead in this one when he took

over.

“I do like to be in front,” he
reasoned. “I didn’t have to worry.
The guys in front of me (Swiger,
Carlos Reisen, and Hufnagel) are
good.”

Other thinclad winners in the
Classic were Greg Ellis in the
shot put and Bryant Salter in the
High jump.

A Hoopsters Find South Unhospitable

 

  

The hoopsters visited the South with little
success as they lost shooting battles to LSU,
120, 79, and Tulane, 110-89 Friday and Satur-
day nights. 1

In Baton Rouge, the cagers were caught flat-
footed by LSU’s pressure defense. And by half-
time, the Tigers owned _a commanding, 67-34 lead.

“They scored mostly on fast breaks, steals, and‘
lay-ups,” said basketball coach Buzz Ridl. “They
were very quick and we couldn’t protect ourselves.
Their pressure defense was very effective.”

Pistol Pete Maravich was limited to" 40 points,
13 tallies below his scoring pace, but the nation’s
leading scorer was a big factor in the loss.

“He didn’t have an outstanding game,” said
Ridl, unimpressed with Maravich’s, 13-34 shooting
from the field. “but he’s a fine passer and a great
player.” _

Maravich, as usual, did it all. The 6-5 guard con-
trolled the Tiger attack with his dribbling, passing.
and shooting. But LSU’s over-all offense proved its
power Friday night.

“They were just too quick,” said Ridl, “and we

didn’t shoot well against them. You can’t afford a
poor shooting night against LSU.” '

Against Tulane, the cagers shot more likein the

time, the cagers were shooting close to 65 per cent
from the field.

“They were bigger than us,” said Ridl. “We knew
they would be. But their shooting was unbelievable.
They shot 65 per cent in the first half too.”

Both teams dropped off from their first half shoot-
ing pace, but the cager drop was much greater.
In the second half, the men of Ridl found the mark
only 35 per cent of the time and finished with a 47,
per cent shooting night. Tulane shot an incredible
55 per cent. .

“Tulane had beaten LSU at LSU,” said Ridl,
rationalizing Saturday’s loss with his usually opti-
mistic outlook. “Saturday night’s game should have
been very close. That’s an indication of how well
we played.”

Tulane outscored the hoopsters, 12-2, in the final
minutes of play. But the Green Wave had other
similar spurts in the second half, when their zone
defense succeeded in effecting the cager‘s timing.

“A few spots hurt us,” said Ridl, “but we did a
good job against Tulane.”

Now that the cagers are back north. Ridl must
bring his players down on the ground again. The
next game is Wednesday night at the Field House

sity. CMU is not quite the ‘power that the cagers

Only Four Firsts
Swimmers Lose Fifth

by MARTIN HELLMAN

The varsity swimming team drove down to Maryland Satur-
day for a meet, and they quickly reaffirmed something that
they had already known. The Terps of Maryland University prov-
ed to be an extremely strong swimming team just as Coach Bill
Brant had expected.

“They were a very, very tough team,” Grant remarked after his

squad had dropped its fifth meet of the season by the score of 72-41 Sa-
turday evening at Maryland.

Despite the sizeable margin of defeat, Grant was extremely pleas-
ed with his squad’s performance. “All of our swimmers swam their
best times of the season,” Brant said.

According to Grant, the margin could have been even greater except
for the fact that “the Maryland coach played it like a real gentleman.
He tried to place his boys in such a way as to make the meet ipterest-
ing.”

Dave Wessel accomplished the feat of sweeping both one and three
meter diving events for the sixth time this year. Although he was able
to rack up over 280 points in the three meter dive against Ohio U., his

V winning total in Maryland was 250.70.

Besides Wesse1’s two victories, the tankmen were able to finish
first in only two other events.

Howard Norris captured first -in the 200-yard butterfly race in the
time of 2:09. Gene Hoffman, the squad’s. best breastroker, won the
200-yard breastroke with a time of 2:28. ‘

Richard Norris and Hoffman placed second and third respectively
in the 200-yd. individual medley. Ken Goldenberg and Bob Manfredo did
likewise in the 200-yd. freestyle. '

The team’s weakest events, the 500 and 1000 yard freestyle,
again hurt their chance of victory. Dave Smith took third in the 1000,
while placing second in the 500 ahead of teammate Stuart Johnson in
third position.

In the seven meets this season, the mermen have been able to
take only two firsts in both events.

Other points were scored by Joe Hayes with his ‘second place in
the 200-yd. backstroke, and third place in the 50-yard freestyle. Rich
Hauger took third in the butterfly and backstroke races. Chuck Zietak
again displayed good form in finishing third in the three meter dive.

Again the same problems that
have plagued the team all season
were present this past weekend.
The gymnasts went with only
two scorers in the floor exer-
cise and the long horse vault
events. Again weak showings in
the last two events of the meet.
the parallel bars and the hori-
zontal bars prevented the team
from getting any higher than the
lower hundreds.

Again, though, the six man squad
showed its versatility and de-
termination as there were some
bright spots to the meet. In get:

scoring over one hundred points. _
the gymnasts managed three first

Lowell Meek remained unde-

an 8.5. Captain Dave Andrew also
showed well in that event scoring
7.75. These were the only two per-
formers in this event as Bernie
Jesiolowski’s injury to his left

ing.

“We haven’t found out for sure

what’s up with Bernie’s knee. If
it needs an operation he’ll be out
for the season and we’ll go with
the six we have,” explained coach
Warren Neiger.

Neiger also feels that with
Meek’s fine performance, he has
a real good chance at doing well
at the Eastern Championships in
March. “From there the Nationals
aren’t that far away and Lowell is

MR. DeYOUNG .'



sE@*ttIr:;2.u.rr:.1v1‘rr

   - .
"@@LMf!3R@MlIlS 1-‘?

Dear Mr. DeYoung :

"Is Business Bluffing Ethical?" is a recent‘
article which appears in the Harvard
Business Review (January- February 1968).
In that article the author, Albert 2. Carr,
raises some difficult questions about the
nature of competition among business
organizations and about the relationship
of a person's ethical and moral standards
to the conduct of daily business. Several
examples of conflicts between ethics and
"business sense" were cited. Let's
consider a concrete example.

Tom was a sales executive with a Southern
firm. He told of an instance when he had
lunch with one of hisymost important
customers, a Mr. Colby. At the time of
their meeting, the state was having a very
heated political campaign over which

Tom and Colby were of different
persuasions. Colby mentioned that he was
treasurer of the citizens’ committee
supporting the candidate Tom opposed.
Before the two men got down to business,
Colby asked if he could count on Tom for
a $100 contribution to the Lang campaign
fund. Tom's reaction was the following:
"Well, there I was. I was opposed to
Lang, but I knew Colby. If he withdrew
his business I could be in a bad spot.

So I just smiled and wrote the check

then and there."

Upon discussing the matter with his wife,
Tom found that she was bitterly
disillusioned with the business world
because it could put such pressures on a
person to go against his own values.
Tom's perception of the incident was that
"it was an either/or situation. I had to do
it or risk losing the business."

Mr. Carr suggests that such situations are
part of the "game" which governs the
business world. He goes on to compare
ethical standards of business organizations
today with the ground rules of a poker
game. "That most businessmen are not
indifferent to ethics in their private lives,
everyone will agree. My point is that in
their office lives they cease to be private
citizens; they become game players who
must be guided by a somewhat different
set of ethical standards."

Finally, Carr cites a Midwestern executive
as saying "So long as a businessman
complies with the laws of the land and
avoids telling malicious lies, he's ethical.
There is no obligation on himto stop and
consider who is going to be hurt. If the
law says he can do it, that's all the
justification he needs. There is nothing
unethical about that. It's just plain
business sense."

Mr. DeYoung, the student whom business
wants for its management ranks is not
interested in playing games where he

must maintain two identities and two sets
of ethical vaIues—one as a private citizen
and one as a businessman. I would be
interested to know how you personally
reconcile the conflicts between your
ethical beliefs and your "business sense."

Sincerely yours,

49.w/ 4?. car.

David G. Clark
Graduate -Studies, Stanford

Dear Mr. Clark:

Indeed there are some men of the calibre
you cite in business; probably in greater
number than most responsible
executives know.

I suspect also that there are many
instances where a man like your sales

, executive, Tom, compromises his personal

"ethics" to make a sale. But wasn't he
trapped by his own supposition? Didn't he
write-off his own company's integrity,
along with the history of the customer's
satisfaction with their product line and
service backup, when he wrote the check?

It strikes me that a little intestinal
fortitude, and a tactful remark about his
own political convictions, would have

» brought the issue to a proper test:

business based on quality products and
service versus "bought" business.

If the man won't make the test, then he
ought not to make business a whipping
boy because he chose to compromise his
own standards. If his employer won't
stand the test, then his choice is obvious:
quit, and join a company whose standards
measure up to his own. In the long run he
will have done himself a favor because an
ethical man, who is competent, always is
in high demand. A posture aligned with
high standards will gain more respect of
significance than any setbacks sustained
through loss of a few sales.

As for-the Midwestern executive who
equates business’ ethical standards simply
to compliance with the law—it being
implied that this falls short of what
society would expect-—l question both his
awareness of the law's comprehensiveness,
and his insight into most businessmen's
motivations.

Responsible executives don't make
decisions on the basisof legal
permissiveness; of seeing what they can
get away with at the risk of courting
punitive actions at law, or the public's
displeasure. Those are negative yardsticks,
and the thrust of business thinking that
involves moral judgments is affirmative.

Check product specifications, for example,
and see how many exceed standards
established by regulation. Results: a better

v1i**Tvvvv‘**ivvi*7‘*'  T -7&7‘.-‘vi-vyryv vyvﬁr-.rTi'v"‘?V‘rvéwv -yr?"-U-'—7'*-or-*"r'-'r’v.r"v'r1r-'v'i'r'-yr-7 Q-T Tﬂvr-7-U-‘Ur

 

quality product, greater performance,
longer life expectancy.

Take re-training and re—assignment, of
employees to better-paying jobs requiring
greater skills when automation phases out
various work slots. Results: more
high|y—skilled employees, better-earning
potential, greater job security.

Consider the direct personal involvement of .

more executives, and the application of
their company resources, in efforts to deal
effectively with such urban crises as
ghetto unemployment. Results: more local
employment, a step toward self-help, a
broadening base for stability.

None of these actions are compelled by
law . . . they areataken voluntarily by
businessmen acting under the compulsion
of their personal ethics. It is the beliefs
underlying such actions that I regard as
the criteria for responsible businessmen's
ethics. Critics may question this criteria as
self-interest. I'll buy that. It is. Butit is
enlightened self-interest which is simply
good "business sense," and reflects the
ethical standards that broadly prevail

in our free society.

The point is that in business, ethical
standards encompass not only questions
of personal conduct and integrity, but the
whole range of business’ activities with
the public as a whole. Yet in the final
analysis it is always the individual who
must make the decision: a decision that
will reflect the influences of one's family
life, religion, principles gleaned from
education, the views of others, and one's
own inherent traits of character. It is these
factors that show up in a man's business
decisions. not the other way around.

The man, therefore, who maintains his own
convictions and sense of moral values will

I be a better businessman, and will find that

there really is little problem in developing
a business career without fear
of compromise.

Sincerely,

Russell DeYoung, Chairman,

WHO CARES ABOUT STUDENT OPINION?

Three chief executive officers— The Goodyear Tire &
Rubber Company's Chairman, Russell DeYoung,
The Dow Chemical Company's President,

H. D. Doan, and Motorola's Chairman, Robert
W. Galvin—are responding to serious questions
and viewpoints posed by students about
business and its role in our changing society . . .
and from their perspective as heads of major
corporations are exchanging views through
means of a campus/corporate Dialogue Program
on specific issues raised by leading

student spokesmen.

BUSINESSMEN DO.

Here, David G. Clark, a Liberal Arts graduate
student at Stanford, is exploring a question with
Mr. DeYoung, Administrative activities in Greece
and Austria, along with broadening experience

in university administration, already have claimed
Mr. Clark's attention and auger well a career
in international affairs.

In the course of the entire Dialogue Program,
Mark Bookspan, a Chemistry major at Ohio
State, also will exchange viewpoints with Mr.
DeYoung,‘ as will David M. Butler, in Electrical
Engineering at Michigan State, and Stan Chess,
