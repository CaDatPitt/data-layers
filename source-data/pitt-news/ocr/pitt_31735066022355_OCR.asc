As his term wanes, Student
Government Board President
Brent Saunders said that he has
made every effort to live up to his
campaign promise of being
“Representative of and
Accountable to You.’’_ '

Saunders said he feels he has
accomplished his goal of being
representative of the student

by Saunders.

“He has definitely helped us
out a lot. He always talks to us.
He has represented us better than
a lot of presidents have in a long
time. He helped us by working
with the SGB Allocations
Committee to get the things we
needed, like a computer and a
combination lock for our office,”
Demming said.

Saunders also asked ROTC for
its input, according to Andy Scott,
ROTC battalion commander and
president of Scabbard and Blade,
the military honor society.

“He kept us informed of what’s
going on, but I don’t have any

“I don’t think anything negative

Efﬁnger said.

As far as accountability,
Saunders promised to put up a
bulletin board which will report
what he and each of the board
members are doing week by
week.

The bulletin board was ordered
some time ago and should be up
by the middle of November,
Saunders said. The bulletin board
will be located outside the Towers
and will serve as a message board
for SGB and other student groups.
It will also include the weekly
minutes of SGB meetings, so

students can keep up with what ‘

the president and board are doing,
according to Saunders.
“It was my promise, but it was
something [SGB member Chad
Wertz] started. He asked if he
could get the ball rolling. He
started, and I finished it.
Everything has been approved.
It’s now a matter of facilities

Harassment common
for campus ‘liberal,’
‘conservative’ groups

By Jenna Ferrara

They make threatening phonecalls.
They tear down or write derogatory comments onﬂyers for
campus organizations. ‘ '
And they are rarely caught.

Anonymous threats and harassment continue to plague campus *
» groups that are perceived as liberal or conservative, and there

doesn’t seem to be much anyone can do about it.

Students for Life member Joel Garrett is well—known on
campus for his vocal work in the pro-life movement. Garrett, the
former president of Students for Life, said he has received many
threats and threatening phone calls, among them, “if that Joel
Garrett doesn’t watch out, he’s going to get knocked down.

“You turn on your machine at night and get this message from

hell. And you’re wondering what you did to deserve this,” he

said. “All over campus I see my name written down with
derogatory comments attached to it. It doesn’t bother me.”

The SFL office-has been “constantly targeted by harassment A  V

and harassing notes," Garrett said. Threatening comments are
frequently written on the group’s cubicle, and once the desk was
“trashed” so badly “they had to screw back the plastic sign on
our office.” . I

“I don’t think anyone will win any political arguments by cruel
name-calling, these kind of insulting games," he said. “I think it’s

a sneaky, un-intellectual and underhanded way of getting your

own point across.”

Garrett said SFL fliers are torn down “almost within ﬁve
minutes. If it’s on a bulletin board in school, especially if it’s
stamped by a school stamp, it shouldn’t be torn down.”

He and current SFL president Melissa Collins said the harassment .

probably doesn’t come from other campus organizations. “I’m

sure every group has its crackpot member, but overall most of

the groups leave each other alone,” Garrett said.

Many graduate students are asked to
critique classes they have taken in an
attempt to improve the quality of those
classes.

Mary Anne Kramer, a .46—year—old
doctoral candidate from California,-was
asked to critique a core anthropology
course in 1988. She wrote what she
considered to be “as positive a paper as I

could write” but criticized the organization

and the problems with the system.

After writing this critique, Kramer said
she noticed a change in her professors’
attitude toward her, which came to a head
when she was failed on a test which she
said she should have passed. Because of
the failure, Kramer was dismissed from
the doctoral program.

Kramer has subsequently filed suit
against the University of Pittsburgh on the
grounds of conspiracy, discrimination and
fraud.

Kramer came to Pitt after earning three
degrees at San Francisco State University,
including a master’s in museum study.
After searching the country for a doctoral

‘ program that suited her interests, Kramer

decided on Pitt. \
But trouble began even ‘before she" got

~ . a-here: i‘I wanted a program with cognitive H

 

  

anthropology, and Pitt offered that course," _, i

she said. “I thought, ‘This would be just
perfect.’

“After I arrived, they told me that they
didn’t have that anymore; they changed
the whole thing," Kramer said. “Now, they
could have informed me. I mean I wrote,
saying that I was coming. That was bad
faith on their part.”

Once she got here, she discovered that
she had not been assigned an advisor,
something she said is imperative for a
doctoral candidate. "I was not assigned an
advisor, Instead they said that I had-to

choose my own courses, but that I had to

take these core courses,” she said.
Kramer said the first class she took was
good, except for the way the tests were
graded. ,
“They got people from outside the course
to grade the papers, and that’s unethical,”
she said. “I’ve been in teaching a long
time. I would never step into someone
else’s course, even if asked or ordered to.”
Two months after the first class ended,
Kramer was asked to write the critique.

“So I went home and wrote a letter on my _

word processorand tried to be as positive
as I could,” she said. Meanwhile, other
students in her class had written another

letter, ‘criticizing the course, which she _

signed. _ _ J 4

Art poster altered

By Mike Lowe
Staﬁ“ Writer

A pair of black bikini underwear has been drawn with
magic marker on the naked man in the reproduction of
John L. Cleaveland’s painting “When the Water Drops.”

The poster, which hangs on the bulletin board by the
Schenely Cafe in the student union, was censored without
the knowledge of student union management.

“I don’t see anything wrong with it [the poster] and I
think that it is childish for someone to do that,” Jennifer
Lambermont, information desk employee at the student
union said. ’

As long as posters are not obscene and are appropriate, »

they will be hung in the student union, according to
Lambermont. The poster had approval to be hung in the
union.

Management at the student union stressed that they
would not have tampered with the poster. If a poster is
approved by the managers, they will not change it in any
way. _

Barbara, McClure, Director of the Carson Street Gallery,
said, “It is unfortunate that the only thing that someone
sees is the naked body instead of the entire image.”

She encourages everyone to come and see the painting
in order to take in the entire image.

C1eaveland’s painting is on display at the Carson Street
Gallery through Nov. 9.

Sigma Chi holds Derby
Days to benefit charity

By Arthur Graziani
Stajf Writer

This week Sigma Chi fraternity
will hold its annual Derby Days in
the hopes of raising over $5,000 for
Pittsburgh charities.

The fund raiser, which runs from
Wednesday to Friday, will have
events ranging from banner contests

_ to dances to scavenger hunts.

All money raised by Sigma Chi
will go to the Rehabilitation of
Pittsburgh, while the participating
sororities will be able to choose
where to donate the funds they
raise, according to Derby Days
Chairperson Pete Lewis. .

“Derby Days is a national fund-
raising activity run by all of the
chapters of Sigma Chi,” Lewis said.
“Up until this year all’ the money
raised by the event went straight to
the Rehab Institute. But with so
much sorority participation, we have
decided to split the money among

several organizations. It is our way

of acknowledging the sororities and
their help.”

Rehabilitation Institute Director
of Development Ann Austin

explained what the funds are used .

for.

“Since 1984 Pitt’s Sigma Chi
fraternity has made significant
donations to the institute,” Austin
said. “We use the funds to help
children at the institute pay for the
costs of treatment  this money will
be a great help,” Austin said.

The headline of the event is on
Thursday night, when Sigma Chi
will hold “Sig-N—Da1es” a humorous
strip—show based on the
Chippendales idea. The event,
sponsored by Drawers located on
Meyran Avenue, is open to all
students.

The Sigma Chis, along with the
sororities involved, will also can the
streets of Oakland to raise money
for the event, according to Lewis.

Universzy gets $5 75, 000
to examine birtla defects

By Barbara Hoffmann
Staff Writer

Pitt researchers have received
a $575,000 grant from the National
Institute of Health to study the

' genetic cause of a birth defect

that can be fatal to infants if it is
not immediately detected and
treated.

Hirschsprung disease, which
affects one in every 5,000 births,
is caused by a‘ ganglion nerve cell
that does not grow into the bowel
system during prenatal
development.

Without this ganglion cell, the
body cannot eliminate waste,
according to Aravinda
Chakravarti, Ph.D., associate
professor of human genetics and

principal investigator for the

study.

These ganglion cells are
responsible for contracting and
relaxing bowel. This defect can
be corrected with surgery, but it
is risky to operate on infants,
Chakravarti said.

“Although treatment is effective,
it cannot be done very well in
young kids because they still need
to absorb nutrients [through the
intestinel,” Chakravarti said.

Without immediate diagnosis,
the blocked bowel in severe cases
can lead to infection and
eventually death.

A sign of HRSD, according to.
‘ Chakravarti, is the inability to

pass the meconium plug, which
keeps the intestines blocked
before birth. The plug should be
passed within the first 48 hours
after birth in order to eliminate
waste.

Chakravarti said the symptoms
of the disease can be severe in

some people and mild in others. 5

People may have bowel trouble
throughout. their life and not
realize that they have a mild form
of HRSD. ‘

Twin sisters are being used in
one study to uncover the genetic
cause of the disease. One sister
has HRSD, and the other doesn't,
but both sisters have children
with the disease.

Studies are being done to
determine if the twins are
genetically alike.

No Contraceptive
is good unless you
both like it.

VCF‘ Vaginal Contraceptive
Film is recommended by
thousands of gynecologists
across the country. A micro-
thin square of VCF begins to
dissolve instantly, delivering
an effective dose of non-
oxynol 9, the non—hormonal
spermicide most recom-
mended by doctors. You (or
he) won’t even know VCF is
there. VCF Vaginal Contra-
ceptive Film has been used
over 10 million times by
women who want protecti in
against pregnancy as well as
enjoyment. Look for VCF in
all THRIFT drug stores. Use
only as directed.

advertisement

This proves that a child may
inherit a severe form of the disease
even if the parent has not or has
only a mild case of HRSD,
according to Chakravarti.

“Once we find the gene, we
can understand why HRSD occurs
and how the gut fails to develop,”
Chakravarti said.

He said researchers would like
to find the locations of these
genes so they can better diagnose
some families. Early detection is
becoming more common because
pediatricians are more aware of
the disease and its symptoms, but
some people with a less severe
form of the disease still aren’t
diagnosed until adult life. V

By locating the gene that is
responsible for HRSD, researchers
hope to find a way to identify
people with_other “multifactoral”
birth defects, which are
caused by genetic and
environmental factors, such as
spina bifida.

Anheuser—Busch offers
college students a $5,000
scholarship for knowing when
to say when in its third annual
$20,000 “Know When To Say
When” poster competition.

According to Mike Lenzen, a
public—relations officer for
Anheuser—Busch, the poster
competition was set up to get
college students involved with
this specific alcohol-awareness
focal point.

The contest challenges
students nationwide to stretch
their imaginations and creativity
to develop posters which
display the need for personal
responsibility and respect for
the law when consuming

alcohol.
Joseph P. Castellano, vice
president of consumer

awareness and education at
Anheuser—Busch, said, “A

student’s ability to draw is not
important in this competition.
What is important is the idea
and thinking beyond the
concept.”

Lenzen agreed with
Castellano and said that it’s not
the art that is important but
the idea which is being
conveyed. '

The winning‘ entry will reign
over the 1992 National
Collegiate Alcohol Awareness
Week. The prize includes a
$5,000 scholarship. Five $1,000
scholarships and 20 third-place
scholarships will also be
awarded.

Lenzen said, “[Those] are a
couple of good reasons to
participate."

' Judging will be completed in
early January. The judging
team consists of individuals
from Anheuser—Busch, NCAAW
and different advertising
ﬁrms.

The grand—prize winner will

The remaining posters will

"Getting students involved in
these awareness activities are
good,” Lenzen said.

Last year over 2,500 poster '

entries lubmitted

According to Edward H.

“Making the personal-

create those messages than the

by Anheuser—Busch, Inc., and

' according to Collins. “We want

to educate them [about abortion],
not freak them out.”

“But Collinslsaid she often re-
ceives phone calls “in the middle
of the night, [where] people call
and they don’t say anything.”

Unpleasant phone messages
on the Bisexual Gay and Lesbian
Alliance answering machine
come in two types, according to
BiGALA co-president Melissa

Smith.

Some callers “give their
religious opinions. They’re things
you laugh at and aren’t a threat,”
she said. _

But some are frightening, like,
“If I see one of you fags, I'm
going to push you back in the
closet and deadbolt the door,”
according to Smith. She said the
calls sometimes leave BiGALA
members wondering, “Is there

, going to be someone waiting for
me in the stairwell?” Almost all

the harassing calls are from men,
she said.

BiGALA doesn’t receive many
harassing notes, but “we’ve gotten
religious tracts slipped under the
door,” she said.

Smith said anti-gay graffiti often
appears on BiGALA flyers, and
the signs “usually do come down
pretty fast” after they’ve been put
up around campus.

She doesn’t think there’s a way
to stop the harassment. “There’s
really nothing you can do.”

Assistant director of public
safety Walt Waters agrees.

“There really isn't much wevcan
do  but be on the lookout,”
Waters said. Campus police can
“have officers patrol the area
where things are posted and [try
to] apprehend” the perpetrator,
but it’s difficult to do anything if
there aren’t any witnesses.

Harassing phone calls are easier
to trace. “We have the ability to
have harassing calls traced if

It’s impossible to make accurate
statements about all people who
harass anonymously, but some
generalizations can be made, said
Dr. Penny Crary, training director
at Pitt’s counseling center.

“They may be jealous or angry
at the attention the other receives.
They may be afraid to express
their personal opinion openly
because it is not politically correct.
They may harbor deep resent-
ments toward the other or the
group the other represents, based
on past experiences,” Crary said.

The prevalence of liberalism
on college campuses may cause
conservatives to feel threatened,
according to Dr. Jillian Ballantyne,
a clinical psychologist at the
counseling center.

“In an atmosphere in which it
is politically correct to be liberal,
it may be difficult to express such
intolerance openly. It’s an unusual
variant on the catch—22 situation
in that the very pervasiveness of
liberal thinking might be a
significant contributing factor to
the anonymous expression of
hate,” she said."

Jacinta Dvorak said the group
has had “stuff taped to our cubicle
with Nazi symbols.”

“I’ve had things put under my

calls after the ﬂyers went up”
advertising the CRS. Dvorak no

caller once told Dvorak she was
“an upper—middle-class bitch who
had nothing better to do with my

she said.

CR ﬂyers are also torn down --

the political cartoon on CR

with a photo of the Ku Klux Klan
and tacked up in campus
buildings. The matter was turned
over to campus police.

Dvorak said the harassment

delivered until tlIe middle of
November. We’re on his case. It’s
being manufactured right now.

“Once it’s delivered it will go
up in no time at all. We will have
to put the wiring in [for the
lighting]. I’m not sure how long
that will take.” Additional
residence halls were another of
Saunders’ promises, but he said
he did not initiate construction of
the new dormitory by Pitt
Stadium. “I definitely wouldn't
say that they put it up because of
anything I did. The first thing I
did was make sure I could sit in
the committee and help design it.
Results are results. I took part in
it, but I wasn’t the force behind
the results,” Saunders said.

Saunders also promised
increased campus security in the
form of expanded shuttle service
and better lighting. “[Shuttle
service] is something that the
Public Safety Committee has sank
their teeth into; they’re working

on it. I think they did improve the -

lighting at the Frick Fine Arts
building,” Saunders said.

The task of putting lights at
Frick Fine Arts was turned over
to the Freshman Council,
according to Saunders.

Pittsburgh. I talked to Lou Tronzo
and facilities management, and
he said they were working on it,”
last year’s Freshman Council
President Jacob Brody said.

Assistant to the president Lou
T ronzo and facilities management
Director’ Thomas Hussey both
said they had no knowledge of
the proposal. “In all honesty I
have never talked about lights at
Frick Fine Arts,” Tronzo said.

“I don’t remember any
discussion about Frick Fine Arts
and lights," Hussey said.

Eliminating problems of off-
campus housing was another task
Saunders set out to accomplish.

“Last year we had several
complaints. Now we have a
lawyer that sits [in the SGB office]
three days a week,” Saunders

said.

Saunders also wanted to break
down the language barrier caused
by foreign teaching assistants,
but the university took care of
that problem before Saunders had
a chance to.

“Almost immediately [after my
inauguration] the administration
passed the mandatory language
test for foreign TAs.¢They have to
pass a language test,” Saunders
said. ,«

Other promises included a
financia1—aid board and added
computer labs. The "labs are,
according to Saunders, an
undertaking of board member
Craig Williams.

computing labs. It will be on this
year’s ballot," Saunders said.

Creating the financial-aid board
will be delegated to the academic-
affairs committee, which has yet
to be given a chairperson. “I met
with Betsy Porter [of the Office of
Admissions and Financial Aid],
and she agreed to do a committee.
It will relate student complaints
to her office. As soon as we
appoint an academic-affairs
committee chairman, he will
spearhead [the boardl,” Saunders
said.

Porter said there has been talk
about the board, but it has not
gotten off the ground.

“I talked with Brent when he
was a candidate. There is no
undergraduate committee at this

point. I did meet with Gil Golden

the other day, and we are in the _

position at the FinancialAid Oflice
to meet with students about their
concern,” Porter said. g

Saunders also wanted to have a
crosswalk installed on Forbes
Avenue between David Lawrence
Hall and Forbes'Quadrangle,' but
the city said it was not
possible.

“I met with [former President
Wesley] Posvar about it. It wasn’t
a university thing. It was a city
responsibility. He dropped a letter
to Mayor Masloff, and her office
told us that it would disrupt
traffic,” Saunders said. '

l.  change of pace

. . Breaking the mold set by previous Student Government
Board presidents is not an easy task. In the past, presidents
have made countless promises to the University of
Pittsburgh community and then, subsequently, rescinded
them. This procedure is most often followed by an
apology and weak excuses at the end of their terms.

-' I Student Government Board President Brent‘ Saunders,

however, will not be apologizing at the end of his term

1 ‘ , this December. Being “Representative of and Accountable

to you” is one theme that never left Saunders, as he
directed the Student Government Board through, quite
possibly, one of the most controversial years ever at Pitt.
~ Through former Pitt President Wesley Posvar’s retirement-

1  ‘ . package scandal, the search for a new Pitt president, fraud

in Pitt’s food-service department and sporadic controversies
that surrounded Pitt on an almost daily basis, Saunders

- did not allow his priorities to ﬂuctuate.

Saunders has been commended by several student

1 _ groups on campus such as the Inter-Fraternity Council,

the "Black Action Society, the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian

 V Alliance and the Reserve Officers Training Corps for his

participation with each organization. Appreciation is not
something that comes easily from campus groups, but
these thanks only enforce the belief that Saunders knew
what he was doing in office — and he did it well.

Last year's SGB Presidentjulie Shepard appointed Lisa
Campoli to the presidential—search committee without

- input from tuition-paying students. Saunders has “broken

the mold” in this respect, too. If a decision was to be made
that affected’ students, Saunders conducted polls to gain
an understanding of what it was the majority of Pitt
students wanted. .

Thanks to this procedure, most of the decisions made
by Saunders contained more student input and less of
what former presidents thought the students wanted.‘

I . When asked about his participation in the construction
"of Pitt’s new residence halls, Saunders replied, “I definitely

wouldn’t say that they put it up because of anything I did. ”

. -T his type of honesty is typical of Saunders’ commitment

to serving Pitt students.

_ ' While we have been played with and lied to by other

university officials, Saunders has refreshed us by allowing
us to know exactly what he has done and what he is doing
to improve student life at Pitt. ~

The implementation of a bulletin board outside the
Litchfield Towers is another example of Saunders’ attempts

I ' to diminish student apathy. The board, which is scheduled

to be hung in November, will contain the minutes of SGB
meetings and also an up-to-date agenda of the activities
of SGB members.’

Saunders’ ability to delegate authority to others should
also be commended. Past presidents have often attempted
to accept all the responsibilities of their position by
themselves. Because of this, most policies were not given

I the full attention they needed to adequately satisfy Pitt

students. _

Since Saunders’ conduct has differed from the way most
SGB presidents have conducted themselves in the past,
wecan hope that his footsteps will be followed by his
successor. '

-“Representative of and Accountable to You” Saunders
‘deserves much more thanks than just a few lines on his
resume.

There I stood in another line,
trying to get registered for my first
term at Pitt. I was just minding my
own business when the person
behind the counter‘ asked
innocently, “Your age?” I told her.
She hesitated slightly, then handed
me a piece of paper and said,
“You may want to read this.” It
was a note with some suggestions
for non-traditionally aged
students. In the ﬂash of an instant
I had gone from good-old-
nothing-special me to a member
of the Gray Panthers. “

I couldn’t believe it. How could" ’
‘I not be a traditional student? I

have plenty of jeans and T -shirts,
and I definitely have no money.
Come on. H '
What more does someone
need? All right. Maybe I am slightly
older, than a few. OK, maybe
eight or nine or 12 years older.
What the heck, ‘I'm young at
heart. Sure, I don’t drink as much
beer as I used to, and after
basketball games I ache in places
I didn’t even know existed, but I
am not ready for a cane either.
“Non-traditionally aged” makes

me feel like I oughtto be doing a '

denture—cream commercial.

I am non—traditionally aged, and
the fact is I just don’t quite mix‘
perfectly with people who don’t
remember a president before
Ronald Reagan. I don’t want to
sound like I am complaining; it’s
just that I was really looking
forward to going back to that fun,
free and exciting world I

_ remembered college to be.

Instead I found that I just don’t
fit in. My concerns, passions,
interests and hopes aren’t the
same as most undergrads.

Acceptance difficult for oder students

Mark
. Carlin

Despite my best efforts,
somewhere in the past 10 years
something odd happened: I
changed.,

So now I say things that when
I was 18 I swore I would never
say. I find myself thinking things
hopelessly unhip, and I don’t
really care.

Here are a few quick
observations about college life
that I have made as a
thirtysomething:

1. I am amazed at how lazy and
whiny most undergrads are and
how lazy and whiny I probably
was back then.

2. I am disappointed at the
contempt that so many students
openly display toward any notion
of actually learning something. I
understand‘ that most students
are here because it may be the
best way to get a job, but maybe
they could learn that there is a
value in just being educated.

3. It’ is very strange to realize
that I have more sympathy with
those who teach the classes than
with those who attend them.

4. I realize that I have lost some
passion for life. I envy all the
students who charge at life with
great vigor. Whether it is partying
like this is the last day on earth,
silly but impassioned discussions
or pursuing romance with an
open and sincere’ purity, most
students seem to try to make the
most out of every moment
(excepting, of course, those

moments in class). It is impossible
to look at all that energy and not
feel that something important has
been lost.

However for those of you who

I are recent non-traditionally aged

admissions who don’t want to
stick .out, let me~make a few

suggestions.

1. Don’t talk about
remembering a Democratic
president. A

2. Don’t ask about the current
music. Most students are ‘still

listening to the crap that was out I

when we were in college and

«hoping something better was '

coming (ZZ Top, Bad Company,
Foghat, Heart, Kansas, etc., etc.,
ad nauseam).

3.. Don’t mention that you
remember black-and-white TV.

4. You never heard of eight-
tracks. '

5. When you mention “Star—
Trek,” you of eeurse mean the
Next Generation. .

6. Never, ever start a sentence
with “I remember when” or “Back
then.” This is guaranteed to make
your listener remember

‘something very important they

have to do right now —
somewhere else. \

7. Lecture less, and listen more.
There is still plenty to learn.

Well, it’s getting late, and since
I’m older, I have to get my rest.
Before I leave, I want to say one
thing to all traditionally aged
students: When you see some of
us old codgers walking around,
take a little pity on us. Remember:
Some day you may be 30.

Call me paranoid, but when

, politicians begin to describe their

personal and political agendas as
“moral imperatives,” I get a little
nervous. ’

Pennsylvania state Rep. Steven
Freind, R-Delaware County, a U.S.
Senate hopeful, is using exactly
those words to describe his
campaign to defeat Sen. Arlen
Specter in the Republican primary.

Freind’s campaign speech at
Carnegie Mellon lastweekend, in
which he stated that the single
most important issue facing the
world today is the preservation
of human life, turned out to be
another classic collection of
conservative contradictions.

Allow me to expand on that.

Something that has always
puzzled me about conservatives
in general is the way they can so
valiantly defend zygotes, capital
punishment and Desert Storm all
in the same breath.

Why is it that human life takes
on a special sanctity in the womb
and nowhere else? Why is it that
anti-abortion advocates will
barricade abortion clinics and not
_nuclear—weapons plants?

Freind, who called himself the
“point man of the pro—life
movement,” strongly supports the
death penalty.

According to Freind, a woman
who has been raped should not
resort to an abortion because it
“does not make the rape go away;
it merely suggests that you subject
the woman to another act of
violence.”

If this logic is sound, why should 0

our society resort to the death
penalty, as Freind advocates?
Does the execution of a criminal
make the crime go away? Isn’t the
killing of a living person (as
opposed to a fetus) the ultimate
act of violence?

An unwanted child is more

Knapick

likely to experience the abuse or
neglect that can be a prelude to a
criminal adulthood. By forcing
women to carry unwanted
pregnancies, Freind will be
creating a constant supply of
victims for the electric chair.
Another bone of contention; In
last weekend’s speech, Freind
said that homosexuals should be
excluded from the protection of

.civil—rights legislation because

they have a choice as to whether
they are gay or not and because
the choices they make are
“abnormal.”

This rationalization for such
blatant discrimination is
thoroughly based on the‘
assumption that gay men are

Croatia shall not perish

homosexual by choice. Such an
assumption,‘ which has no
scientific backing, is comparable
in truth value to Freind’s statement
that the death penalty is a “proven”
deterrent to crime. It seems that _
even though psychologists are
still debating this “nature or
nurture” controversy, Freind is
already prepared to offer his
verdict. V

Even if. Freind’s basic.
is some sort of choice holds true,
a double-standard ‘still arises.
Don’t Mormons, for example,
have a choice on whether or not
they are Mormons?

Couldn’t,- some Mormon
practices be viewed as “abnormal”
under the subjective eyes of one
group or another? 4 '

These statements hold true, yet
we wouldn’t dream of excluding

Mormons from the protective ‘ '
umbrella of civil4rights legislation. ' fOfTl1e Pitt News.

The fighting between Croatians and

» seems to be projected‘ by the media in
their coverage of a supposed cease-fire

national groups in the -crumbling
Yugoslavian federation. ‘
Instead the battles have become
fiercer and bloodier, as independence-

This issue needs to be stressed and
- explained more in the media, because
the news seems only to be saying that
the fighting between the Croatians and
Serbians is due to ethnic.reasons. The
truth of the matter is that the Croatian
people have voted for a democratic,
westem—style system, while the Serbians
have chosen to keep the Communist
system intact. The Serbians do not want
‘ to accept the Croatians’ right to run

to these two groups merging together

‘as one force.

The rest of the world can no longer
sit and watch events deteriorate in the
Republic of Croatia and do nothing
about them. Croatia needs immediate

recognition as an independent state. I

This will allow Croatia to turn to theiUN
in order to seek international action
currently unavailable due to the
reluctance of some countries to meddle
in so—called ‘internal affairs” of a now
extinct Yugoslav state.

Secondly, Croatia will be able to

receive arms in order to defend itself
against conquest. This war is immensely
imbalanced. Serbia has had total rights
to the Yugoslav arms-making industry,
which is almost exclusively located on
Serbian soil. (Incidentally, this same

Serbian arms industry sells spare parts ,

to the United States and was one of the
primary suppliers to Saddam Hussein’s

-war machine.)

It _is time for the United States to
realize that the seriousness of this
situation has gone beyond the
capabilities for solution by the European
Community alone. A country that
champions freedom in the New-World

should not restrict its support to a -

. chosen few, such as Kuwait, the Baltics

and Haiti. Croatia is crying out for help,
and we have to recognize this fact by
recognizing its right to self-
determination before more innocent
civilian lives are lost.  -»}  - ~' '

» "constantly scorned them, but people are

still having sex andnothing seems to stop
them.” j '
In the opening lines of the quirky song

.“People.Are Still Having Sex,” LaTour
addresses a serious .issue in our society. ‘

Indeed, people are having sex, and the

’ rates are increasing. Yet the chur'c:h,_mos‘t

parents and othersocietal inﬂuences are
promoting abstinence. B S A
There is a definite conﬂict here.
While the church has not changed its
views on premarital sex since forever, 50

"percent of the nation’s high school girls

are sexually active, according to a recent
issue of Time. Newsweek also stated that 50
percent of all -15-year-olds have had sex,
compared with 10 percent in 1960. The
sexual activity of our society is changing,
but the church is not. .

_The church has been irrelevant and
ineffective concerning sex.

I am a product of my church. I attended
church whenever the doors were open,
and I accepted the teachings about sex. I
was told masturbation was abnormal. I
was told it was wrong to have sex with
your ﬁance even if it was the night before
your wedding. I was told the more you
have premarital sex, the less you can give
to your spouse. Heavy petting or oral sex
meant-you were only a virgin technically.
All of these things were very bad, and if
you broke the rules, you were outside the
will of God. . ~ " -

Unfortunately, the teenagers who attend
church are physiologically the same as

~ -teenagers who do not. The _teachings of

thenchurch _had to combat the urges of the
body. Pubertyrcomes over a year sooner
for adolescents now than it did 100 years

It was at this point that she
noticed the professors’ attitude

._ toward her had changed.

“.The professors were rude to
me in class. They ignored me

_when I‘asked a question,” she

said." Kramer noted that she hadn't H
made the correlation until several
weeks later, when shefailed the

I. test.

“I was shocked,” she said. “I
thought it was a positive letter. It
was not a destructive letter by
any means.” Later she learned
that her professor, L. Keith Brown,
had beenup for a raise at the time

 9 and needed a good letter of

recommendation.

Kramer said one problem with
the course was . the frequent
absence of Brown from class.
She ‘said he had gone with former

Pitt President Wesley Posvar to

50°/o

raise money in Japan and also
made two separate trips to New
,York. I I
The class was also highly
disorganized, according to
Kramer. “They made up a
syllabus,” she said, “but they paid
too much attention to detail. They
made the rules up as they went
along." This was the complaint
that she pointed out in her letter.
After the test, Kramer
discovered that she had received
a “D,” when others in the class,
who only had bachelor’s degrees,
got B's.
She failed a subject on which
she had just written a large paper.
“One part of the test asked us
to write about perspectives on a
subject,” she said. “I wrote about
religion, since I had just taken a
course on that." She added that

‘she had previously written a 40-

forces her to write slower than

‘We're not inthe business ;of

.g.r_ading; papers-‘,’ ” she said.
_“Professors can do whatever they

want to you, and you have no
recourse.”

Kramer feels that Pitt never
intended to give her theeducation
she paid for, which is why she is
suing for breach of contract. “They
were going to get rid of me from
the beginning," she said. But she
is also charging conspiracy (for
her grade on the test) and fraud.
“To sign a paper saying that a
man [Brown] is a good teacher so
he can get a raise is wrong,” she
said.

But her biggest complaint was

.what she called retaliation for

expressing her First Amendment
rights.

“They asked me to write my
comments; I wrote my comments.
They didn’t like my comments,
so they threw me out," she
said.

She wants Pitt to pay her for the
money she would have received
with her doctorate. “I would have
made $50,000 a year for 20 years,”
she said. “I want them to pay that.

“My academic career is ruined.
No doctoral school will take me
now. If you want your academic
career ruined, go to Pitt.”

Pitt seniors fail to defeat cross—state rival Pe

By Ryan Buncher
Sta_[)" Writer

Having won nine in a row, Pitt
volleyball. rolled into its biggest
match of this season against rival
Penn State and rolled right into a
wall. _

“We came out hard in the first
game and didn’t maintain it,"
said Pitt Coach Sue Woodstra. ,

The Panthers won that first
game 15-7 but lost the next three
15—1_O, 15-5, 15~13.

“We didn’t win the big points,”
Woodstra said. “We didn’t serve
as well as we usually do.

Eighteen service errors, six by
senior co-captain Dee MacAulay,

were a major part of the loss. So
was the play of 19th—ranked Penn
State’s big three of senior co-
captains Jenny Shuller and Kim
Kumfer and junior Leanne Kling.

Shuller had 17 kills, a .345 kill
percentage, and 21 digs. Kurnfer’s
25 kills were tops on the team,
and she had 15 digs. Kling had 18
kills and 14 digs. Penn State,
which raised its record to 15-3,
was also aided by the return from
injury of first—year setter Salima
Davidson, who had five kills and
seven digs to go along with 56
assists.

Pitt did hit better than Penn
State (.242 to .226). Serving and
defense were the differences.
Penn State had 29 more digs in

the match and six fewer service
€I'I'OI'S.

Senior co-captain Sue
Zonneville had a strong match
for the Panthers, with a match-
high 20 kills, a .318 percentage
and eight digs. MacAulay had a
strong match outside of serving,
with 1 1 kills, no hitting errors and
14 digs. Senior Heather Hollands
had 11 "kills and 12 digs. Outside
hitters Ann Marie Lucanie and
Linda Zols struggled. Lucanie had
16 kills and 25 digs but had nine
hitting errors, four service errors
and a kill percentage of. 149. Zols
had a .094 percentage and two
service errors to go along with
her nine kills.

The Panthers’ record stands at

15-6 after this very disturbing
loss. Pitt players had focused on
this match for a long time and
seemed very confident of ﬁnally
beating Penn State, which no
player on the current roster has
ever done.

“This was the last chance for
our six seniors against them,”
Woodstra said. It was also their
best chance. ,

They had not only won nine
straight matches, but the most
recent wins had been
dominating fashion. Penn State
had been less than exceptional
lately, including a recent loss to
an average Minnesota team,
although that was without
Davidson.

Last year Pitt had a very
emotional loss to Penn State in
rnid-season at Fitzgerald Field

House. They did not play, for a .
-week and then lost their next

match against Duke, a solidteam
but one they had already beaten
twice. if

After their season-opening loss.
to Penn State this year, they played.
two matches the next day and
won both in three games. Yet
again they will not have as much
time to stew after the loss. They

« The Pitt soccer team battled the
Robert Morris Colonials to a 2-2
tie yesterday in a game plagued
with rough play, questionable
officiating, missed opportunities
and fouls, fouls, fouls.

The Panthers withstood a
plethora of yellow cards and two

a ejections which could have cost
them the game if not for their
solid defense.

‘ As he has done all season, first-
year defender Bob Dyer drew the
task of shadowing the opponents’
top player. He rendered RMC’s
top offensive threat, Jomo Pitt,
helpless in the first half.

“lPanther' head coach Joe
Luxbacher] said that if we hit [Pitt]
hard enough, he would back
off,” Dyer said. 9

, RMC’s Pitt turned out to be all
bark and no bite, spending the
game's second half warming the
bench. “Dyer did a pretty good
job of shutting him down,”

Luxbacher said.

After Robert Morris scored with
10 minutes to play in the half,
Pitt’s substitutes made their move.
Less than one minute later,
forward Don Overmier rifled a
feed from J.R. . Perdue past
Colonial goalkeeper Doug Petras,
tying the score at one goal apiece.

Early in the second half, backup
Panther goalkeeper Kirk Brodow
(making his second start) showed
signs of inexperience when he

As for the strength of the
Panthers, Belowich found that
the overall team performance is

its greatest asset. Last season's’

conference meet can attest to

that: Pitt only had two individual

champions (Krissa Ratliff andjuliel

Rocks) but consistently placed

Two minutes later the Panthers
responded again with a quick"
goal. Forward Scott Alexander’

the goal, catching Colonial

backup goaltender Vasil Chapla  

off-guard and knotting the score
at 2-2. -

of the Panthers’ halftime change

offensive players missed the ball
and an easy goal. And with less‘

than three minutes left in A 

regulation play, a shot on a
breakaway by forward Eric Prex
rolled inches wide of the Colonial
goal.

The overtime periods were
marred ‘by fouls, yellow cards
and short tempers. The Panthers’
tempers could have cost them
the game. ’ '

“Some of the guys were
worrying more about themselves
than the team,” Luxbacher said,

Tight end Moore gives QB van patconsrstenritargs

By Rob Pugliese
Staff Writer

The last time a Pitt tight end led

' the team in receiving was 1980,

when Benjie Pryor hauled in 47
passes from quarterbacks Dan
Marina and Rick Trocano.

Senior Dave Moore appears
destined to change that.

After seven games Moore leads
the Panthers with 33 catches for
258 yards and has already set a
personal record for receptions in
a season. Last year Moore ranked
second on the squad, with 32
‘receptions for the entire season.
This year he is on pace to reset
the Pitt record for receptions by a
tight end, currently held by Pryor
with 47. At his current rate, Moore
would finish with 51 catches.

Moore has played the past three
games with torn ligaments in the
ring ﬁnger of his left hand, but
that hasn’t slowed him down.
Against Syracuse Moore extended
his streak for consecutive games
with a reception to 17. The streak
dates back to Sept. 8, 1990, against
Boston College.

Moore has accomplished all of
this while playing in a number of
positions for head coach Paul
Hackett. Hackett said that Moore
has responded to “more severe
demands.” Moore has been used
primarily as the H-back, or “tiger
back,” in Pitt’s offense, but he has

also split out at the ﬂanker spot.

and even lined up in the backfield
for a few plays against Syracuse,

with the injury—laden Panthers‘

being Short-handed On backs.

Moore and fellow senior Eric
Seaman have combined to
become one of the top tight-end
tanderns in the nation.

“Since I’ve been here, both of
us take pride in the way we play,
how we play together,” Moore
said. “We compete all the time.
We take pride, and we try to be

The two have accounted for 60
catches, 612 yards and four TDS.
Moore ranks third in the Big East
in receptions, while Seaman is
tied for fourth with Syracuse’s
Qadry Ismail. _

Moore and Seaman are the
perfect complements to each
other. Hackett said that Seaman
has always been an outstanding
blocker — a bigger, overpowering
type. Moore is the more versatile
pass receiver. This year Seaman
has performed better than ever
before in the passing game, while
Moore improved his own
‘blocking. ‘

“We’ve moved him to more
positions, and he’s played
superbly,” Hackett said. “David is
a fullback. He's a natural, nifty,
physical, make—the-catches,‘ run,
make-a—guy—miss type. He can
even come out of the backfield.
He's had to work hard on his
blocking, and he’s done a good
job. of it.”

KITCHEN OPEN

The University of Pittsburgh
Rowing Club traveled to Boston
last weekend to compete in the
“Head of the Charles" and came
home with some impressive
results. It is now eligible to
compete in the same event next
yean

The event, which hosts the
likes of Columbia University,
Penn, Ohio State, Yale, Harvard
and other colleges from around
the eastern United States as well
as professional clubs, including
an organization from West
Germany, is the largest single-
day regatta in the country. It
drew 3,500 rowers and well over
100,000 spectators, who lined the
river.

The club finished in 15th place
out of 45 clubs in the heavyweight
men’s division, with a time of
19:10 in the 3.1—mi1e event, and
the lightweight men’s team

THE pm News, Thursday, October 1204, 1991

Crew impressive at Head of Charles

finished 22nd out of 55 clubs,
with a time of 19:02.

The heavyweight team, which
is made up of coxswain Leanna
Hopkins, strokes Matt Prechtel,
Pete Alpern,John Dougherty and
bowjohn Evers, had a time good
enough to qualify for a return to
the prestigious event next year.

“I really didn’t know what to
expect,” said four—year member
Leanna Hopkins. “The course was
really difficult, and it was hard to
get motivated. We weren’t familiar
with the course like the other
schools, and they had the definite
advantage. But we performed
well, and I was pleased."

The lightweight team, which is
made up of coxswain Maria
DePasquale, strokes Bob Falk,
Graham Turnbull, Bert Losken
and bow Mike Kuchera, was not
as lucky. It will have to wait for
an invitation to attend next year.
But this did not make the
experience any less exciting for
the club.

 

“We are actually pretty happy

with the way things went for us,”

-said club president and
lightweight team man Graham
Turnbull. “We just went up for
the experience, andto be invited
was an accomplishment for us in
itself. We are just happy to walk
away with what we did.

“We really had no idea how we
would do against the elite clubs
that were there,” Tu rnbull added.
“But next year we will know.”

The event was also visited by I

some bigwigs in the rowing
business, including the owner of
Vespoli » boats, _ which
manufactures boats used by
rowing teams such as the ones at
this event.

“He was pretty impressed with
how well we performed despite
the amount of resources we have,”
Turnbull said.

“It makes a world of difference
when someone such as he comes
over and talks to you. It makes it
all worth it.”

The Pitt News

The season drags into the
second half with only a handful
of title contenders still frontin’.
We took the Orange last week
and won, unfortunately, but Cal
was able to keep it close with the
Huskies, and we couldn't cover,
so we stand at 15-10 on the long
season. This weekend's matchups
are the weakest of the year to
date, with a shoddy Southern Cal
team visiting Notre Dame. Despite
the lameness’ of the schedule,
Schoolboys Two remain
interesting.

(+4) Pitt (5-2) at East Carolina
(5-1), Saturday, 1:30.

Pitt dropped their second
straight game, 31-27, to Syracuse
in a thriller. This one won’t be
any easier. East Carolina comes
in ranked 20th and well-rested
from its off—week. If you aren’t
familiar with the Pirates, well,
they beat Syracuse 25-20 in the

Moore

Continued from page 11
Seaman’s involvement in the
offense depends on the way the
defenses are playing Pitt.

“Alex basically looks to his
primary receivers first,” Moore
said. “It all depends on what the
defense is giving him. When they
don’t give up the deeper pass,
he'll usually look underneath to
Eric or myself. I'm more of an
underneath guy, outlet guy, not
really the primary receiver. Some
weeks, depending on how the
defense plays, we’ll have more
chances than other weeks. It
depends on the team.”

Pitt’s primary targets are deeper
downfield, running 15- to 16-
yard routes, according to Moore,
and that has left him open quite
a bit underneath. However
defenses have adjusted to Moore
and Seaman and lately have
limited their yardage a great deal.

This would explain Moore’s.

average of 7.8 yards per reception.

“The last couple weeks
defenses have been breaking real
well on the ball,” Moore said. “In
the past we've always caught
passes for six or seven yards, but
we were usually able to get the
first down. But everybody’s
playing deep, looking for us to
catch the ball now.”

“We have lived at this point in
the season with the tight ends,”
Hackett said. “When we design
plays, the tight ends play a
dominant role in the design of
the play. They may be the first
receiver or, most of the time, the
second.”

Moore’s 75 career receptions
place him 15th on the all-time
Panther list. He needs just three
more receptions to move past
Billy Osborn into 14th place.
Moore has led Pitt in receiving in
three games (5. Mississippi,
Maryland, Notre Dame), while
he and Eric Seaman shared the
lead with five receptions each
against Syracuse. Moore may get
an opportunity to continue his
career in the NFL next season,
but he said he really hasn’t thought
about it much. For now, his

thinking lies with the Pitt offense. .

_~Tm=._i§_1'_ifr _N1=.Ws, Thursday,,Ovcto_l)er 24,1991

Irish, Tr

Dome two weeks ago.

The Pirates run an offense that
is very similar to Miami’s, and
ﬂanker Dionjohnson is their big-
play man. His speed could give
Pitt major problems. One of the
fastest players in the nation,
Johnson ranks fifth, with 181.5
all-purpose yards per game. He
handles return duties to
complement his receiving and
rushing. Their line is big and
strong, averaging 290 pounds per
man and featuring a left side that
boasts 338-pound tackle Tom
Scott and 295—pound guard Mike
McCalop. They're. excellent pass
protectors, allowing only one sack
in six games. Senior tight end
Luke Fisher is Blake’s main man.
Fisher has 29 catches for 399
yards and three TDs. The Pirates
don’t turn it over often: only six
times in six games.

Once again Pitt goes without ~

running backs Curtis Martin and
Glenn Deveauxe as well as
defensive end Keith Hamilton.

‘ This will be another tough test for

Pitt. Like the last two weeks, the

  

story could be whether or not the
Panthers establish a ground attack
of any consequence. \

Alex Van Pelt should have a
very big day against this club.
The Pirates allow a 65—percent
completion rate. But both Notre
Dame and Syracuse had suspect
secondaries, and Pitt’s inability to
run the ball allowed these
defenses to sit back and force
Van Pelt to throw short routes,
thus softening the damage greatly.
Pitt’s linebacking corps continued
its smashing style last week, with
Charles Williams earning Big East
Defensive Player of the Week
after a 15-tackle performance.
Williams, Rico McDonald, Tom
T umulty, Curtis Bray and Nelson
Walker form one of the meanest
crews in the land. End Sean Gilbert
showed he’s ready for prime-
time with a monster game last
week.

The Panthers are underdogs
for the third consecutive week,
but this time we’re with them.
Look for the Panther D to pressure
Blake more than he’s seen and

actually pick a couple balls off.
After facing ND and the ‘Cuse,
Pitt should be used to seeing
speed and play more consistently
this time. This should be an
exciting ballgame with Van Pelt
outgunning Blake and Pitt
prevailing late. Take Pitt +4.
Southern Cal (3-3) at (-13) Notre
Dame (6-1), NBC, Saturday, 1:30.
Collegiate tradition is on the
line in this matchup of some of
the scholastic world’s great
powerhouses. USC has been
inconsistent all year, while the
Irish continue to prove that their
program is outstanding. Notre
Dame struggled last weekend at
the Air Force Academy, escaping
with a 28-15 win against a feisty
Falcon team. Large fullback
Jerome Bettis continues to stir the
Irish mocha offense as he
pounded out two more
touchdowns. This sophomore is

prime-time. Rick Mirer keeps the

ground game in motion with
options and his own scrambling
ability. The Irish offense can score.
The defense is underrated,

  

ojans resume feud in South Bend    

allowing only 22' points their last I 

two outings.

USC is ranked ninth in Division ' _

I volleyball, and this team knows
how to spike, or at least get
spiked, as was evident in their
awful performance at home
against Stanford._They are in

serious danger of a losing season _

with a trip to Cal next week. One
game does not a season make,

but the Trojans’ second—week win ' I

against the Nittany Lions will ‘
probably be the season's lone
highlight unless they can shock
this weekend. Not likely, though.
Quarterback Reggie Perry hasn’t
looked sharp at all, and even all-
American tailback Mazio Royster
has been subpar. That's
being generous. Their only hope -

is to blitz the hell out of Mirer and — .
hope for turnovers to capitalize _

on orlfor a massive game from
Royster. ’ 1

Look for the Irish to run‘ the
draw play all day against -the

overaggressive Trojan defense and T 7 -

for Mirer to scramble for big plays.

Take (ugh) Notre Dame -13.

Drop all preconceptions of
Shakespeare’s classic; the
Pittsburgh Public Theater"s
Hamlet offers a fresh look at the
Dane, courtesy of director Ron
Daniels.

First staged in 1989 for the
Royal Shakespeare Company in
England, Daniels’ interpretation
highlights the youthful innocence
in Hamlet’s questioning of his
father’s death. The “To be or not
to be” soliloquy has Hamlet in
pajamas, like a child just
frightened from sleep, and upon
seeing Claudius admit to
murdering Old Hamlet, the child
pounces on the bed with glee,
thrilled at the success of his game.

I'1rIE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, October 24, ,1991

Public Theater’s Hainlet fresh look at Bard classic

who returns as a ghost to remind
Hamlet of his unc1e—turned—
stepfather’s guilt.

Claudius, Old Hamlet’s brother,
poisoned the old king to steal his
wife, Gertrude. Claudius and
Gertrude marry shortly after the
death, causing young Hamlet
much grief. He feigns madness to
carry out his vengeance, fooling
even his devoted lover (Ophelia)
and trusted friends (Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern).

Mark Rylance, as Hamlet,
follows the spectrum from naive
child to calculating and cautious
adult. Rylance savors each word
of the text, at times speaking the
verse as prose but never
sacriﬁcing meaning.

(Christine Estabrook) and
Ophelia (Stephanie Roth) stay
consistently strong through their
violent interactions with Hamlet.
Even Polonius (Alvin Epstein)
betrays his usual image as a
bumbling idiot of a chief
Counselor. 1
Antony McDonald creates a
strong space from the Public’s
thrust stage._A huge frame
alternately outlines a blue drop
and a large off-balance window
on the upstage wall, leaving the
main stage essentially empty.

The window, giving way to a ,

stormy sea outside, converts into
a mirror by way of lighting design.
By reflecting images of the
audience next to the actors on-

 

witnesses and confidantes to
Hamlet’s spiritual journey. “Who
calls me villain?” he demands of
the audience, who look into their
own eyes while passing judgment.

Design elements work together
to bring Hamlet near to the

Miller, mainly through Quentin,
preaches about his views on the
relationship of innocence to truth
and the nature of guilt by
association.

Don’t get me wrong; there is
some good theatre here, which
this production performs
remarkably well.

There are a few excellent
confrontations between Quentin
and his second wife, Maggie (the
Marilyn Monroe figure in the play),
and between two of Quentin’s
friends: Lou, a law professor whose
career depends on him not being
declared a communist by
McCarthy’s committee, and Mickey,
who wants to name names before
the committee and, as he says, “tell
the truth” about what he sees as
the “communist conspiracy.”

By Jason Hillman
Photography Editor

It’s the '40s versus the ’90s,
wholesome business versus
greed, George Bailey versus Larry
the Liquidator in Norman
Jewison’s new movie, Other
People’s Money. The ’-40s,
wholesomeness and George lose
big.

Danny DeVito plays Larry the
Liquidator. in this movie about
the new greed. And George
Bailey isn’t really in the movie,
Instead it’s Gregory Peck, who
plays Andrew “Jorgy” Jorgenson,
the chief executive of New
England Wire and Cable, Larry's
new target for liquidation. When
Larry starts, Jorgy calls in the
daughter of his “companion,” Bea
(played by Piper Laurie), to fight

off Larry.

The production notes say that
Larry realizes that he may have
met his match in Kate Sullivan
(the daughter), but that is a crock.
It is hardly _a contest except for

reactionaries are saying it.”

Ellen See1ing’s set design is
simply two large screens, behind
which some of the memory-
people ﬂash brieﬂy into existence.
In the center of the otherwise
empty stage is a large, monolithic
form which serves as the seat of
Quentin’s memory and as any
furniture necessary for the various
scenes.

Mounted into the monolith are
two video monitors. Images from
the holocaust are projected onto
them as an external visual
commentary on the play. Through

1

these images, director Keitel raises
one of the play’s major themes —
mankind’s guilt for the Nazi
murder of millions ofjews during
World War II — to a pinnacle,
where it becomes the key visual
theme of the production.

But at times, when the play
makes no reference to the
holocaust, the monitors become
superﬂuous and conspicuous by
their inactivity. '

' Aside from this one ﬂaw (and
the preachy nature of the play
itself), Pitt’s production is
uncommonly clean and free of
‘external emotional baggage. All

in all, it is an excellent evening’s
entertainment.

The University of Pittsburghs
production of Aﬁer the Fall
opened last Wednesday and runs
through Saturday, Oct 26, at the
Studio Theatre in the basement of
the Cathedral of Learning.

Traditional Japanese theater piece comes

By James Westerman
For T be Pitt News

The internationally renown
Ninagawa Company presents

Sotoba Komacbi, a traditional

Japanese Noh theater piece
written‘ by 14th-century
playwright Kwanami Kiyotsugu,
the father of Modern Noh theater.
The Ninagawa Company
performed this modern
adaptation of the play at the 1990
Edinburgh Festival and were
greeted with rave reviews.

Noh Master Motoi Hanayagi
performs an excerpt from the
original Sotoba Komacbi followed
by the Ninagawa Company’s
production of playwright Yukio
Mishima’s modern adaptation of
the same play.

I spoke through an interpreter
to one of the actors, Haruhiko
Joh, to get some insights into the
production. The Ninagawa
Company is following up its
success at Edinburgh with a tour
of four U.S. cities. Haruhiko
played Macduff, in Yukio
Ninagawa’s production of
Macbeth in New York last year
and said he likes performing for
American audiences, who are

more directly responsive and -

more outgoing with their reactions
to his performances, unlike
Japanese audiences who, he said,
are more shy and reserved.

He said he is also happy to be
performing this modern
adaptation of Sotoba Komacbz’ for
American audiencesbecause he
believes that theater should

transcend national and cultural
boundaries. The Noh theater or
Shakespeare or Racine or
whatever — Haruhiko said they
belong not only to the
playwright’s own country or
culture but are treasures for the
whole world.

Likewise Sotoba Komacbi
should transcend the boundaries
of time and appeal to modern

audiences not just as a period
piece but as a work of drama in
its own right. Japanese theater
has a long history grounded in
traditions handed down from
father to son over the generations.
Until the Japanese ended their
self—imposed cultural isolation
with the opening of their borders
to outside inﬂuence during the
Great Restoration 130 years ago.

to Pitt

The marriage of the traditional
elements of Japanese theater is
very much the point of this
production. In the same ways
that Ninagawa tries in his
adaptations of Shakespeare to
make the plays at once Japanese
and Shakespearean; Yukio
Mishima attempts to make Sotoba

Komacbi both traditional and

computer—composed music at one
point, but I decided that
computers don't make interesting
music. Humans do. It’s artiﬁcial
stupidity. There’s a chemically
randomness in us. Some things
are uniquely suited to humans,
and composition of music is one
of them. I guess the operative
word is ‘soul.”’

Forget all other notions of
cyberpunk: Sharp, a man with
profound knowledge of the
technical and mechanical, is the
real McCoy.

Since his arrival on The Island
in ’79 his musical resume is
voluminous, from one outfit called
jump Cut to the big, bad, large
sister of,Carbon, the 15-member
larynx, which was commissioned
for the 1987 Next Wave Festival
to the _, Bootstrappers, a New
Alliance label concoction that
featured George Hurley and Mike
Watt. ’

Although he's classically trained
by the Brooklyn Academy and,
like Julliard dropout Miles Davis,
Sharp's fodder for sound has
traversed the Mississippi, citing
Robertjohnson, Bessie Smith and
Leadbelly as influencesjump cut
to Tibetian Monk dual—chord
chanting (which is’ considered
anatomically impossible, say
western physicians) to the “throat
singing” of the Arctic Inuit Tribe
to Ayler squalid bop (which are
all found in Sha'rp’s music),
Sharp’s pupils are softball—sized,
and his retinas are informatically

hard up.
One can even trace him to the
‘Burgh, where he spent a Natural

Science Foundation grant‘ at

Carnegie Mellon.

“I spent most of my time
designing better fuzzboxes and
playing with a multi—head tape
deck they had. By the end of the
summer, I no longer wanted to
be a scientist,” he'said.

Fortunately I was able to
procure the latest Carbon product,
titled Datacide, which is to be
released on the Enemy record
label any time (just, about) soon.

Instead of the global and far
off, one _hears the Downtown
scene on full throttle, displaying
wobbly, elliptical, horn frenzies,
bass and cello hack sawings and,
I dare say, the fabled Scottish
banshee. All of it has a cohesion
rarely seen outside the Downtown
scene — even some Basie big-
band, chorus-line coat tails.
This time Sharp sticks with his
buddies Mori, Frisell, Russell and
Rothenberg in terms of a type of
sound.

After all this said about the guy,
a conclusion might be in the
negative, dismissing him as high
upon Mount Western, a slummer
in what is repugnantly called
“ethnic music.”

But that would be unfair.
“World Music” is very similar
commercially and ascetically to
goofy, bald, white dudes

chumming in chinos ‘bout getting

a hard on. Sharp is diametrically
the opposite — making little

injapan, is still somewhat difficult
for modern Japanese audiences,
so Mishima has developed it into
a modern theater piece which is
