Farrakhan will speak here

despite heated controversy

By Karen Frost
Staff Writer

Final arrangements have report-
edly been made, and Louis Farrak-
han has accepted an invitation to
come to Pitt next fall to lecture on
black economics, leadership and the
Moslem movement. The date has
been tentatively set for Nov. 14, dur-
ing the Black Action Society’s Black
Week.

Much controversy has sur-
rounded the decision to invite Far-
rakhan to Pitt. The Black Action
Society initially requested Farrak-
han in March, when they submitted
their 1985-86 budget to the Student
Government Board. The request for
Farrakhan, who has reportedly
called Judaism the “gutter religion"
and referred to Hitler as “a very
great man, wickedly great.” These
remarks have given Farrakhan a
reputation for being anti-Semetic,
racist and a speaker of incisive
propaganda.

The Student Government Board
approved the BAS budget March

20, which included inviting Farrak-
han as a lecturer. SGB President

» Luke Kluchko defended the Board’s

decision saying, “When representing
all students, we must stand for free-
dom of speech. If there is one place
to express all ideas, it should be on
the university campus." The univer-
sity does not have a speaker-banning
policy.

To add to Farrakhan’s notoriety,
college campuses which have hosted
the speaker tell stories of armed
security guards or Fruit of Islam
members who, in one instance,
allegedly refused to allow white stu-
dents in to hear Farrakhan.

According to one student who
attended a presentation last Wed-
nesday at Hillman library, Farrak-
han’s public relations representative
was accompanied by an armed Fruit
of Islam member. This display had
the student, who wished to remain
anonymous, wondering if Farrak-
han would bring more armed Fruit
of Islam members with him in the
fall.

The SGB issued a resolution stat-
ing “the Student Government Board
is in concurrence with the United

States Senate (Amendment 3363,
June 28, 1984) that there is no place
in our society for hateful, bigoted
expressions of anti-Jewish and racist
sentiments such as those reportedly
being made by Louis Farrakhan 
the Board is of the unanimous con-
viction that the above mentioned
sentiments are antithetical to this
university’s purposes and goals, as
well as being morally repugnant.”
The SGB requested that the Black
Action Society and any other stu-
dent organizations which seek to
provide a forum for Louis Farrak-
han to immediately repudiate in
writing the sentiments and expres-
sions of hatred reportedly made by
Farrakhan.

Darryl Davis, a BAS member,
responded to the Board’s request,
saying “BAS does not espouse,
advocate or legitimate any of the
ideas or attitudes our lecturers
express. I don’t like being forced to
defend someone or repudiate
someone.”

Jewish organizations on campus
are planning to offer alternative
speakers to offset Farrakhan’s
appearance.

Pitt group tracks volunteers
trying to kick cigarette habit

By Susan Benedek
Staff Writer

Cigarette smoking is a habit that
is hard to break. Priscilla, a 34-year-
old housewife and mother who
wishes not to disclose her last name,
will testify to that.

“I watched my mother die of lung
cancer every single day for a year. To

see such an awful thing — that’s
what broke the camel's back,” Pris-
cilla stated.

Priscilla is one of 150 volunteers
who are taking part in a three-month
study at Pitt of the effects on people
who are trying to stop smoking.

“Lots of people manage to quit,
but to stay off, that’s hard. It’s like
Mark Twain saying, ‘quitting is
easy. I’ve done it a hundredtimes,’ ”

said Dr. Saul Shiffman of the Uni-

“I watched my mother
die of lung cancer every
single day for a year. To
see such an awful things

versity of Pittsburgh’s clinical psy-
chology department-

Shiffman, who is ‘a consultant to
the Surgeon General and who has

I

been studying behavior associated
with smoking for 12 years, hopes to
recruit more volunteers for this
study. However, he stresses that the
research does not help the person to

quit. He only tracks the volunteers

through day-to-day activities as they
try to cope with routine stress while
trying to kick the cigarette habit.
“We can’t‘ and won’t help a person
quit. We are looking for people who
are actually- planning to quit or who
have begun to quit,” he stated.
The study is conducted via tele-
phone calls and letters to the volun-
teers. To be eligible, a person must
be an adult who has been smoking at
least 10 cigarettes a day for a year.
Statistically, three out of four
individuals who quit will relapse
within six months. According to

The Peace Movement, as with
many Pittsburgh organizations, is
feeling the effects of Pittsburgh’s
hurting economy. From the neigh-
borhoods as well as the campuses,
the support has been sparse and the
activity level low.

This activity surfaced on Satur-
day as less than 200 Pittsburgh stu-
dents and residents marched in the
rain for the second annual walka-

thon ofthe Pittsburgh Campaign for‘

a Nuclear Weapon Freeze. But walk
coordinator Fred Lancaster is
optimistic about Pittsburgh’s freeze
movement. “Actually, we’ve been
making a lot of progress, ”said Lan-

that are critical. Generally, the
longer you are off, the safer you are
from lighting up again.”

According to "Shiffman, there are
two key situations that tempt a per-
son who is trying to quit. The first is
a social environment where other
people are smoking and possibly
drinking. As a result, they are
“smoking before they know it.”

“Alcohol is strongly correlated to
smoking. Research has demon-
strated that those .who smoke are
more likely to be drinkers, though
not necessarily alcoholics and those
who drink are likely to smoke,” said
Shiffman. A

Priscilla said she has been in situa-
tions where she was vulnerable to
start smoking again. However, the
key, according to Priscilla, is to plan
for those “dangerous” times.

“There are certain moments that
will trigger you to light up,”she said.
“For some people, it’s when they are
on the phone or in a car. For me, it
was after a meal.

caster, who claims that the group
has continued to grow despite the
limiting effects of recession and
unemployment in Pittsburgh.

Lancaster sees the solution as a
matter pf economies: “In areas
where the economics are better ~
the northwest, Pacific west — the
activism levels are much higher.
Ours is an area of traditional hard
working people concerned with
bread-and-butter issues, and these
gut-level concerns are more appar-
ent on the levels of freeze activism.
lt’s up to the freeze campaign to
present the peace issue as a bread-
and—butter issue.”

And that is exactly whatthe peace
movement is planning to do. Pitts-
burgh and the state of Pennsylvania,
according to Lancaster, are leading

Economy and apathy hinder local peace movement

Nuclear Freeze

a national effort to restructure the
peace campaign in a fashion that
translates the nation’s nuclear
expenses into costs at the individual
community level, in hopes of chan-
neling the economic interest into
energy toward the nuclear’ freeze
movement. However, the group has
not yet devised a plan to inspire the
campuses into the same activity.
The concern with bread-and-

butter issues, according to Lancas-
ter, has carried over into
Pittsburgh’s student reaction to the
nuclear freeze movement.
“Pittsburgh campuses draw from
areas where the economy is not in a
good position,” Lancaster said.
“These students have experienced
the pains of unemployment and
have reacted with concerns that are
focused on jobs, incomes and their

focuses on withdrawal effects

“The night before I quit, I had to
prepare for this situation. What I did
was, after eating with my family, I
immediately left the table.lWhen I
felt secure enough I went back to the
kitchen and did the dishes.”

The second situation that could
tempt a person to go back to smok-
ing is when they are upset or
angered, according to Shiffman.

“There are a range of emotions,
such as depression or anger, which
try to draw someone back to smok-
ing,” he said. '

There are methods and programs
available to help the ex-smoker. For
example, people like Priscilla attend
clinics that provide support and
guidance while they are trying to
quit. Others try hypnosis or acu-
puncture, and many g “cold
turkey.” ‘

“in any of those methods, the
initial withdrawal symptoms will
make you feel bad, because the body
is not used to functioning without
the nicotine. The usual symptoms
are irritability, trouble with concen-
tration and change in eating and

sleeping patterns," Shiffman
explained. .

Nicotine acts as both a stimulant
and a tranquilizer. It increases blood
pressure and heart rate. However,
scientists are still unsure about what
nicotine does to the brain‘, said
Shiffman.

The concern over the effects of
nicotine has led some companies
such as ALCOA to enact programs
that help employees quit smoking.
According to Prevention Medicine
magazine, corporations which have
programs like this will save $601 a
year per person in health and insur-
ance benefits if the employee quits
smoking.

According to a recent report from
the Surgeon General, 36.7 percent of
the people who smoke have attempt-
ted to quit. But 52 percent have
made three or more such attempts.
The report also stated that an ex-
smoker has 30 percent less chance of
dying from cancer or heart disease.

According to both Shiffman and
Priscilla, a person must want to quit.
However, willpower is not enough.

.‘‘I object to people who say that
you only need willpower. This
implies that a ‘magical’ thing will do
it for you, and that takes the respon-
sibility away from the person trying
to quit,” Shiffman said. “l’ve heard
of people making bets with their
friends or pledging money to organi-
zations they hate. The idea there is
that if you don’t quit, an organiza-
tion you despise will get your
money.”

Although it is too early in his
research, Shiffman said he hopes
that by observing the everyday prob-
lems and pressures these volunteers
go through, he will develop more
successful methods of helping peo-
ple quit.

Quitting has made Priscilla “less
irritable.” She can “think clearer"

and even “remember my dreams bet-»
ter. I feel like I’ve wasted so many.

years by smoking.”

own immediate futures."

Erick Berquist, a member of Pitts-
burgh Campaign for a Nuclear
Freeze, also noted a lack of student
activism, but attributed it to a larger
national trend. "

“The freeze movement across the
country so far has not had much
support from students,” said Ber-
qist. “In Pittsburgh especially, the
peace campaign is not college-
oriented. There is a lot of potential
on campus, but no one has tried to
tap it, and the students are too con-
cerned with getting good grades and
a decent job and have not taken the
responsibility to organize on their
own.” .

This lack of student activism sur-
faced at the march on Saturday.

“The amount of student support is
really disheartening,” said Theresa
Kirchner, a senior at Indiana Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania and one of
the few college students marching.

IUP’s Students for Peace has
organized sit-ins, fill demonstra-
tions and most recently a “die-in,”
where students filled buildings and
lots, faking nuclear deaths.

But Kirchner was not pleased with
the participation.

“I think 50 (her own group‘s mem-
bership) out of 12,500 is a pretty
apathetic response,” she said. “The
pro-Reagan students don't make
much noise, but they certainly make
up the apathetic majority.”

Marci Maleski, the leader of a
peace group at Allegheny Commu-
nity College, has noticed a more
active conservative trend there.

‘‘There’s definitely a majority of
Reagan ‘supporters at my college,
and they feel that by not wanting
war, we were being unpatriotic.
They ‘would even call us commies
and pinkos,” she said. “lt’s a sad
thing when people are not aware or
concerned enough to save their own
lives, and it’s disheartening when
they try to thwart your efforts, but

you’ve got to keep pushing.”

Inspired by the actions ofthe Irish
band U2 which exhibits a white ﬂag
during concerts, Maleski carried a
white flag throughout the march,
claiming, “any allegiance should be
to a flag of white.”

During their concert in April, U2
vocally supported Pittburgh’s peace
movement.

“In that case we were sought out
by the band,” said Tim Barner,
chairman of the World Federalists
of Pittsburgh. “In most cases, it’s the
peace groups that must do the
seeking’:

“Music is an incredibly powerful

source, and plays a role in inspiring
youth — probably more than any
other factor," said Lancaster.
“Music crosses cultural and geo-
graphical barriers and touches an
aspect of every person.”

Cindy Shepard, a senior at IUP,
marched Saturday as a result of the
U2 concert.

“I’m a prime example of music
motivation,” she said. “I didn’t
know anything about the nuclear
freeze movement until the U2 con-
cert. That’s what encouraged me to
find out more about the movement.
I wish other people would listen and
become aware of what’s going on
around them and stop being so apa-

thetic." At the University of Pitts-
burgh, this same apathy seems to
characterize the actions and views of
the students. According to former
Pitt student Ted Wien, “apathy has
been prevalent for as long as I’ve
been a student at Pitt, and I was a
freshman in I976.” Although many
students admit the apathetic campus
attitude toward the nuclear freeze
movement, the reasons for apathy
differed. The explanations ranged
from lack of time to fatalism to lack
of knowledge.

‘‘I’m a full-time student with a
full-time job," said one Pitt junior.
“I don’t have time to spend working
for a cause that may not ever makea

difference.”

The same fatalism was present in
other student comments.

“I won’t get involved because I
just don’t see a solution," said one
student. “We have entered an era of.
inevitable nuclear destruction.”
When asked why she was not
involved in the nuclear freeze cam-
paign to try and avoid this destruc-
tion, she shrugged her shoulders,
turned away and said, “I’ve got to go
to work.” ’

Politicol
insensitivity

Mayor Goode of Philadelphia
and police officials Monday accused
newspaper and TV reporters of
being subversives for “second-
guessing” the tragic death and de-
struction in West Philly. On Tues-
day Mayor Goode ridiculed and
condemned what he called “arm-
chair quarterbacks.”

It takes no second-guessing to

know Monday was a dark day for all
American cities. To hear the stupid
macho tough talk and sports meta-
phors about this tragedy is about the
most disheartening part of all. It’s
sad that this could happen today,
but to hear them insist that is was the
right thing to do and that we should
shut up and accept it can make you
wonder if the spirit of Frank Rizzo
still doesn’t live on in the City of
Brotherly Love. lt’s not just our
right; it’s our responsibility to rally
against such a mentality.
, In a grandstanding move, Mayor
Goode proclaimed that he would
“take full responsibility.” Well,
that’s damn big of him, so let's see
him get out his checkbook and
somehow pay for the lives of the
children. ,

Goode got elected because he, like
Reagan, was a clever politician, and
he quickly learned from Reagan's
example to play on the sympathy of
the American people. Reagan made
the Bitburg critics seem like shrill
special interest people (i.e., un-
American) who were “tormenting”
an unknowing 70-year-old man.
Spokesmen said Reagan was
“anguished," and soon everybody
just left him alone. Spokesmen said
Goode was “saddened and
troubled,” and now priests hold
masses to support Goode. He’s not
the one who’s hurt.

One of the greatest dangers l’ve
seen growing these past years is of
social injustices just getting
explained away and accepted by the
forgiving American people. Many
friends and family members criti-
cized me for my efforts against
Judge Salmon. They said it was the
wrong thing to do, that all I did was
bother people, that the demonstra-
tion and letters really didn’t change
anything. But worse injustices than
the Salmon travesty have been swept
under the rug and, after a time, for-

thing is already being done about it.
Whether the actions were instru-
mental or not, they kept it alive and
on TV every day. You’ve got to keep
the questioning and the action alive.

It's notjust older people who have
such short memories. Apparently
students are much too forgiving as
well. I am so tired of hearing now
how Roger Benjamin is really our
great friend. He sounds just like
Goode and Reagan, only he’s yuppi-
er. He said, ‘‘I think we’ve all read
about the negative externalities"
(whatever that means) caused by the
Five-year Plan. Like Goode and
Reagan, Benjamin is another tough-
talker who is dangerous because of
position and not because ofstrength
of mind.

One scarcely knows where to start
with Benjamin’s indefensible behav-
ior at our university. I might point
out one small example in Benjamin’s
suspicious increasing of Fine Arts
while inexplicably cutting Studio
Arts. The respected Virgil Cantini
points out the unreasonableness of
this action, but apparently he is too
much of a gentleman to point out
Benjamin’s covert conflict of interest
in this extraordinary decision, so
neither will 1.

While the Chancellor and the
deans and chairmen have been busy
building up old departments and
developing new ones, Benjamin has
done nothing by his words or his
actions to gain my respect. If I were a
pharmacy student, I know I would
boycott the pharmacy dinner-dance
he is attending.

But worst of all is when I see stu-
dents and other young people go
along with everything Reagan says
and does, who even quote from Rea-
gan! He is not our friend. He is our
president, but he does not have a
strong mind. If American productiv-
ity is increasing, it is not because of
any government policy, but rather
because of the strength and charac-
ter of the,American people.

Reagan has stood for a return to

have hurt people as far away as

Public opinion
poll misread

Nadia Moritz cites a January
Newsweek magazine poll as indicat-
ing that “the public supports abor-
tion  25 percent support it in every

case and 58 percent in the cases of ’

rape, incest and health risk to the
mother.”l believe Ms. Moritz needs
to reread this poll, as not only are
her figures incorrect, but the thrust
of the poll seems to have escaped
her.

Referring to the Jan. I4, I985
issue of Newsweek magazine, the
percentage supporting legal abor-
tions in all cases is given as 21 per-
cent (not 25 percent). Moreover, the
percentage supporting legal abor-
tions “only in certain circumstances”
is 55 percent, while the percentage
opposing all legal abortions in 2I
percent (exactly equal to the percen-
tage supporting them). Thus, a
whopping 76 percent of the public
(55 plus 21) opposes the current law
of the land regarding abortion (in

' effect, abortion on demand), while

only 21 percent supports it.

Ms. Moritz has likewise misrepre-
sented the second question _of the
poll. She cites 58 percent as support-
ing abortion in the cases of rape,
incest and health risk to the mother
(seemingly a pro-abortion
response). Actually, this percentage
is given as favoring a ban on abor-
tions except in the three cases men-
tioned (in fact an anti-abortion
response). While the change in
wording is subtle, it is undeniably
important in assessing a public opin-
ion poll. The percentage actually
giving a pro-abortion response
(opposing the ban) is only 36
percent.

Thus, by question one of the poll
cited, 76 percent of the public
opposes the current legal status of
abortion on demand (vs. 21 percent
in favor), while by question two, 58
percent opposes it (vs. 38 percent in
favor). It is plain that, at least
according to the Very poll she cited,
Ms. Moritz, is quite wrong; the
majority of the public is pro—life.

Entrepreneurs: making it big

The rise of the college entrepreneur —
bold, self-challenging, willing to take
risks for a superlative reward —. is one of
the most exciting trends on college cam-
puses in I985.  

Entrepreneurs are individualists. They
are dreamers who passionately believe
in their ability to succeed, willing to_ take
the risks necessary to achieve eventual
personal freedom by running their own
companies. I .

After a decade or more of suspicion
and ridicule, there is a rebirth of the spirit
of enterprise among college students -
ya "megatrend," said Verne C.Harnish,
executive director of the Association of. I .  4
College Entrepreneurs. There are at
least 64 self-made millionaires in the U.S.
under the age of I8, according to the
National Federation of Independent

Business. In fact, 33 percent of all busi-
-nesses are founded by entrepreneurs 30
years old and younger.The careers of

the following entrepreneurs illustrate A I s  .
why achieving self-made success is so
‘ satisfying.

By Sandra Cappa

Five million dollars isn't a lot of money to Brian Putnam. He
also thinks that having an empire isn't quite as much fun as the
mere fact that it is possible to construct one. '

I "I've always looked for some other way to do it than the
way presented to me," he said, kicking a pair of Nikes atop a
typewriter, "the way that someone didn't think of."

It is this forward—thinking attitude that started his entrepre— ’
neurial trek from being a computer science major at Pitt to »

president of his very own company, Linear Development.
Since Linear's conception in I983, five employees have been
added, and two spin-off companies, Linear Software and
Linear Divestitures, have been created. .
Putnam's ambitions have been generating since he was a
child. "I've always been surrounded and influenced by peo-

ple who set a high priority on setting objectives and achiev- ,

ing," he explained.

Success runs in the family, as does the spirit of enterprise. "I
have an uncle who was an engineer for Chrysler. He and
three friends of his developed an ultraviolet ray detector for
the skin. It breaks down the sun's rays, and the battery-

operated monitor indicates how much tan your skin is pro— .
ducing. It really works, too. He is in Aruba right now testinga.

new and improved version of it.

"The thrill I get out of entrepreneurism is the independence y

"it allows," he continued. "I see it this way: If I work for XYZ
Corporation, they say, ‘I'll pay you X amount of money,'
because that is how much they think l'm worth. If XYZ doesn't

. want to pay me any more, then where am I?

One of the most crucial aspects of entrepreneurial survival
is self—reliance and determination. V

"It's true that the only thing you have when starting out is
yourself and your confidence; at least that's the only thing I
had when I started. It's the only thing you can rely on in the
beginning — that all the odds are not -stacked in your favor,
things like people telling you that your ideas don't make
sense, the economy, people who don't wantto listen to you."

Linear Development was financed by a successful busi-
nessman who loaned Putnam the money for the initial
investment.

"Asking this person to give me the money wasn't the diffi-
cult part. The hard part was convincing him that I was capa-
ble of absolutely anything," said Putnam. "This man taught
me valuable things about manipulating money. We talk

‘twice a week. He wants to knowghow thingsare going. I call

T-the numbers up on my personal computer, tell him how much
"profit we're making, how much’ were losing. He'll say,
‘Sounds good to me; I'll call Tuesday.’ " I

Entrepreneurs share certain characteristics. Perhaps that is
why people like DeLorean, Donald Trump and Hugh Hefner

_give Putnam something to which torrelate.

"I really respect John DeLorean. The man was probably
making $650,000‘ when he quit. He wanted to build his own
car, got busted for coke, was taped in front of six FBI agents
and got off. This man is special. You cannot deny that he has
the intangible  I don't know if I have it yet, but I hope I do."

A certain amount of knowledge about business is essential
before starting something on your own.

"I read, researched and talked to people who were doing
something similar to what I was trying to do," said Putnam,
"stuff like how to keep your cash flow optimized, having
enough working capital to get yourself through the first-and
second-year losses, maximizing return on those losses."

Contrary to popular belief, entrepreneurs are not high-risk
takers. In fact, mostare averse to risk. "You don't want to do
something unless it_has the potential to succeed, but that isn't
the same as not making a mistake. [The average entrepre-
neur experiences 3.8 failures before achieving success.] I
look at it like this: If I try 550 times and fail, I'm going to try the
SSI st because that may be the time that it all comes together.
I'm not going to make those 550 mistakes again. The thing
with me is that if I can be right5I percent of the time, I'll still be
ahead. I have a lot more mistakes to make, a lot more money
to lose and a lot more money to gain. If your primary goal is
making money, I don't see how you can consider yourself an
entrepreneur. If making a lot of money really fast is your
primary goal, be a stockbroker. Failure’ can't be your scariest
nightmare.

"I know that if this thing gets off the ground, I mean if it
really takes off — if everything I want, all the possibilities l'm

looking at all come true, I'll have to venture out and create »

something else myself."

Chris Warman, the founder/owner of Goodies on ‘Bou-
quet Street, is executing the conventional method of finance

and business venture, sometimes referred to as the "Ameri-.

can Dream." "I want to own an empire," said Warman."
"I got bored with school and wanted to start something on
my own. I remember sitting in computer science and fantasiz-
ing about all the ways I could make money."
Warman's steps are essentially in that direction, too.
Goodies, a cozy, old—fashioned candy store with hardwood

floors and ceiling, was established in February of I984 with I

the assistance of his fiance, Valerie Graziano. Originally
Goodies was going to be a store that made and sold home-
made cookies, but Warman decided that simply selling
penny candy, dried fruit and high-quality chocolate was a
more receptive market. "Besides, there's a fortune to be

* made in it,"said Warman.

Goodies’ rapid growth is evidenced by the fact that War-

its heavy acoustic drumming
(New Order’s love affair with the
LinnDrum has apparently sub-
sided), rough guitar (played with
surprising authority) and churn-
ing bass, builds to a frenetic
climax (rather similar to that of
“King Lear”), and all of this out
of three simple guitar riffs and
Albrecht, who’s normally
reserved, actually shouting.

“Face Up,” which closes side
two, also falls into the goose
pimple-inducing category. It’s a
joyous, bright piece, reminiscent
of “Temptation,” New Order’s
first real “hit.” And as Albrecht
struggles with the melody —
injecting all of the vocal strength
he can physically muster (quite a
slight guy, Albrecht) and occa-
sionally yelping like a smitten
hound — the catchiest two-note
keyboard riff ever penned
bounds ‘along behind him, and
listening stomachs do pleasant
ﬂip-ﬂops. “Face Up” is New
Order at its best.

But that isn’t to say that there
is no room for improvement.
While “Love Vigilantes,” “Sun-
rise” and “Face Up” all smack of
brilliance, several songs on Law-
Life —— namely “Sub-culture”
and “The Perfect Kiss” — seem
to fall somewhat short. Cer-
tainly, they are not bad songs.
On the contrary, “Sub-culture”
has all the makings of a dance
floor smash, and “The Perfect
Kiss” shimmers with slick Euro-
funk production and compelling
Poly-rhythms.

But both, like much of Power,
Corruption and Lies, resign
themselves to the limitations of
the genre —— disco, quite frankly
— and while they hold up well as
“funk” tunes, they lack the pas-
sion and earnestness of the less
synthetic songs.

Not quite a masterpiece, Low-
Life is still New Order’s most
varied and inspiring album to
date. But if New Order keeps

Creve Coeur
A lovely Sunday goes sour

By Leslie M. Bennett
“We must pull ourselves
together and go on. That's all
that life seems to offer - and
demand."
—- Tennessee Williams
What starts out to be a lovely
Sunday full of fun and romantic
possibilities turns out to be more
like a blue Monday full ofconfu-
sion and loneliness in Tennessee
Williams’ A Lovely Sundayfor
Creve Coeur. The Laurel High-
lands Regional Theatre produc-
tion is making its Pittsburgh
debut during the company’s pre-
miere season. .
Though it is one of Williams’
few comedies, A Lovely Sunday
for Creve Coeur evokes a stiﬂing
atmosphere and an oppressively
somber mood. The two-act play,
directed by Glen Z. Gress, takes
place entirely within the walls of
a tiny, outlandishly decorated
apartment in the glaring city
heat of St. Louis.
Sharing the apartment on
working girls’ budgets are Doro-
thea and Bodey, a southern belle

New Order

growing in such quantum leaps
—— Low-Life is musical leagues
beyond the band’s lp debut
Movement — a true masterpiece
may be in the not-too-distant
future.

As for now, I’m wondering
why the hell an album as promis-
ing and passionate as this was
called Low-Life. If New Order is
actually judging this as a low
point in their career, then there
still may be some hope for mod-
ern music.

Sunday morning with Dorothea
furiously counting off sit—ups
and burning off nervous energy,
while Bodey fries chicken and
peels potatoes for an afternoon
picnic. Each has her own plans
for her day off, just as each has
hopes for spending her life.
Bodey has arranged, with
matchmaking motivations, for
the two of them to meet her twin
brother Buddy at Creve Coeur, a
lakeside amusement park whose
name ironically translates as
“broken heart.”

Dorothea, aware of Bodey's
intentions, is uninterested in a
man who “needs someone to
drink beer with and to eat wie-
nerschnitzel and grow fat
together.” She would rather stay
home anxiously awaiting a
phone call from a certain T.

comes Helena, a lonely soon-to-

Then Miss Gluck from upstairs
appears in a bathrobe and

Helena. While Bodey suspects
Helena of being up to no good,
she sympathetically consoles the

At this point, the overcrowded
scene becomes frantic as Helena
rudely persists in seeing Doro-

Though the main actresses
seemed to take some time set-

Collier building pipeline
between Norwin and Pitt

By Michael Bertonaschi
Staff Writer

If you are a follower of Norwin
High School's girls volleyball team
and you want to see how well the
Norwin players do on the college
level, look no further than the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

The Pitt volleyball team could
have as many as three former Nor-
win players starting this fall. This is a
comforting fact to Panther head
coach Shelton Collier who is prepar-
ing for his sixth season. Collier
believed that to have a successful
team at Pitt he would need to fre-
quently make the short trips out the
Parkway East and down Route 30 to
check out the talent that Head
Coach Sheran Watson had on dis-
play at Norwin. “It was one of my
top priorities as a head coach here to
find out about the program [Nor-
win’s] and make some inroads
there,” said Collier.

Collier began the Norwin connec-
tion by signing Sally Gillespie and
Kris Wexell. Gillespie is a 5-4 senior
setter and outside hitter who cap-
tained the 1982 Norwin state cham-
pionship team. Wexell, a 5-5 junior,
also captained a Norwin champion-

- ship team at the outside hitting posi-
tion in 1983.

BLACK DRAGON
KARATE ACADEMY

 

In February, Collier was able to
sign former Norwin standout Nora
Mulvihill. Mulvihill, a 5-H middle
blocker, was considered by many to
be the best player in the state this
past season as she captained the
Knights to yet another state
championship. '

Although the trio had similar
careers at Norwin, only Mulvihill
was recruited with a vengeance by
the major colleges. Both Gillespie
and Wexell were considered too
short to outside hit for a Division I
program. “Sally and Kris were over-
achievers,” said Watson.-“Their atti-
tudes are what separated them from

most players. They were extremely»

coachable and were self—motivated.”

Because of their lack of height,
Collier was not really engaged in a
recruiting battle for their services.
Gillespie was a virtual steal while
Wexell took the opportunity to
remain at the outside hitting posi-
tion as her ticket to Oakland. “The

"other coaches that recruited me

wanted to move me to the back
row,” explained Wexell. “Pitt
offered me the opportunity to out-
side hit so I decided to go there.”
For Nora Mulvihill, the recruiting
was intense. At 5-ll there was no
problem with her height, plus she
had the same attitude and determin-
ation that Watson referred to in Gil-
lespie and Wexell. Mulvihill soon

narrowed her choices to Pitt and
Penn State, and for a while it looked
as though Penn State had won out.
“I originally chose Penn State, but
because I liked what I saw in Coach
Collier, I changed my mind,” Nora
said.

Recruiting proved to be a good
experience for Mulvihill, but she is
glad that it’s over. “It was fun but I
prefer being able to say that I’m
going to Pitt,” said Nora.

Because of the coaching that they
received from Sheran Watson, Nor-
win players have easily made the
transition from high school to Divi-
sion I volleyball. “There’s no ques-
tion that the Norwin girls are better
prepared for volleyball at our level,"
said Collier. “I have a lot of confi-
dence in them and know they will
come in and be very I mature
mentally."

Gillespie and Wexell were starters
the first day that they walked into
the gym at Pitt and the same fortune
is predicted for Mulvihill. “They are
so far ahead of other high school
girls that come in here,” said Collier.
“Actually sometimes they are even
ahead of some of the players we have
on our team since they come in and
start ahead of girls that have been
here.”

With a schedule next season that
includes matches against several
nationally ranked programs, Collier

MAY 22, was

 

(2) form two

is looking for Gillespie, Wexell and
Mulvihill to work hard over the
summer. The Panthers’goal for next
season is to crack the top 15
nationally.

All three players were advised by

Collier on what to work on over the
summer. “Sally is the emotional
heartbeat of our team and she is like
having an assistant coach on the
floor,” said Collier. “I think that the
challenge for Sally will be to become
more of a vocal leader on the floor
and help to integrate some of our
young talented freshmen with our
returning players.”
‘ “We are going to have a young
team next year," said Gillespie, “and
it will be _a challenge for me to be
able to sit down and talk to a player
who is having a bad game and try ‘to
help her get her confidence back.”

Collier has nothing but compli-
ments for Wexell, who at 5-5 is one
of the shortest outside hitters on a

"Division I team. “She is a great

player and she can play circles
around most of the teams that we

“play against,” said Collier. “What

Kris needs to work on is improving
her spiking percentage against six-
foot blockers, because much of our
success next year at reaching the top
15 nationally could depend on her
being able to do that." Wexell
added, “I want to improve my hit-

-_—-g -———

 

ting so that we can win the Big East
again and go further than the first
round in the NCAA tournament and
end up in the top I5.” -

Of the three players, Mulvihill
may have the biggest challenge of
all. Pitt is expecting her to take the
place of honorable mention All-
America middle blocker Ulana
Kohutiak; who‘ recently graduated.
“We recruited Nora to come in and
play that position and I’m sure that
she will be able to do it,” said Collier.
“We don’t expect her to_have the
kind of year that Ulana had but
eventually she is going to be a great
player.”

That sounds like a lot of pressure
for a freshman, but Mulvihill
doesn’t look at it that way. “I don’t
feel any pressure,” she said. “I think
the pressure will be on the players
who are already there, plus some of
the other girls who were highly re-
cruited will have some of the pres-
sure, too.”

The women’s volleyball team
posted a 3.09 grade point average,
which was the highest of any sports
team at the university. They also
made it to the NCAA tournament
this past season. With the help ofthe
three former Norwin stars, the Pitt
volleyball team will continue to
enjoy success both on the court and
in the classroom. I
