Pitt issues responses to
transgender complaints

Gwenn Barney & Em Maier
The Pitt News Staﬂ

Pitt responded this past week to a com-
plaint ﬁled by the Rainbow Alliance in rela-
tion to the school’s transgender policy.

On Friday, Pitt ﬁled a motion to dismiss
the Rainbow Alliance’s complaint, which
The Pitt News obtained. The complaint,
which the campus LGBTQ advocacy group
ﬁled with the Pittsburgh Commission on
Human Relations on April 25, claimed Pitt
enacted “discriminatory practices relating
to public accommodation” toward trans-
gender students.

In the motion, Pitt motioned for the
Rainbow Alliance’s complaint to be dis-
missed because it lacked “actual instances
of alleged discrimination.”

“Because Complainant does not allege
even a single allegedly discriminatory act
or any actual harm from the alleged policy/
practice, there is no case or controversy to

A be investigated,” the motion said.

Rainbow Alliance President Tricia
Dougherty said the motion’s claims don’t
take into account the larger impact Pitt’s
transgender policies have on the overall
campus environment.

Pitt’s transgender policy came under
scrutiny when a University ofﬁcial spoke
in front of the Anti—Discriminatory Policies
committee in March to contradict what had
previously been an unwritten policy, say-
ing that Pitt deﬁned gender based on the
sex listed on the birth certiﬁcate of a per-
son. This policy was met with outrage in
the LGBTQ community, as it takes gender
reassignment surgery —— an expensive and
invasive surgery — and judicial review for a
birth certiﬁcate to be changed.

The change in policy eventually led to
Dougherty ﬁling the complaint.

“The policy itself deﬁnitely caused
harm,” Dougherty said. “Students came to
me feeling not safe or supported. That’s ex-
tremely harmful.”

The Rainbow Alliance has no intention
to drop its suit and plans to ﬁle a response

to Pitt’s motion to dismiss.

“We’re not going to stop speaking up for
students just because someone ﬁled a mo-
tion,” she said.

Seamus ]ohnston’s complaint

In addition to the Rainbow Alliance’s
complaint, Pitt also faces a second com-
plaint from Seamus Johnston, a 22-year-old
transgender man and former Pitt John-
stown student who was expelled in Janu-
ary from the University after he reﬁised to
comply with University officials’ requests

P that he not use a men’s locker room on the

Johnstown campus. Johnston ﬁled his com-
plaint about the University’s policy with the

Pittsburgh Commission on Human Rela-

tions on April 16.

Prior to ﬁling his complaint, Johnston,
a former computer science major, testiﬁed
before a federal judge and a federal grand
jury. He said FBI agents told him he was a
person of interest in the investigation of
the string of bomb threats made against the
University last Feburary through April be-
cause of the nature of his expulsion.

Another group calling itself “The Threat-
eners” has since taken responsibility for the
threats, and the bomb threats have ceased.
The University said the FBI has the lead in
the investigation but declined to comment.

Pitt also responded to Johnston’s com-
plaint with a motion to dismiss on May 17,
this time citing that Johnston’s case took
place in Johnstown. He ﬁled his complaint
with the Pittsburgh Commission on Human
Relations, which holds jurisdiction within
the city limits of Pittsburgh, and therefore,
the University claims his Johnstown~based
complaint fell outside the commission’s ju-
risdiction. -

Johnston responded to the University’s
motion by naming multiple reasons that he
believes his case does fall within the com-
mission’s jurisdiction. Among his reasons
were that all governing policies for the
University branch campuses are subject to

Pitt} Big East lawsuit moving to
federal court T

Andrew Shull
News Editor

The University’s lawsuit against the

Big East Conference changed venues
thisweek, as the Big East had the case
moved to federal court.

On June 4, lawyers representing

the Big East petitioned to have the suit
moved from the Allegheny County Court
of Common Pleas to the U.S. District
Court for the Western District of Penn-
sylvania, because not all parties involved
are citizens of Pennsylvania.

‘ The lawsuit, originally ﬁled on May
11 , alleged that the Big East held Pitt to
different standards than West Virginia
University and Texas Christian Univer— P

    

sity, both of which sought to exit the Big
East before the end of the 27-month exit
window back in October. The Common-
wealth System of Higher Education has
also joined the University against the
Big East. ’

Pitt paid half of the $5 million exit
fee back in September when it an-
nounced its departure from the Big East
for the Atlantic Coast Conference and
also agreed to stay in the conference
until July 1, 2014, but now it wants out
earlier. A

The Big East holds the right to stop
its member schools from leaving the
conference for 27 months, but Pitt’s

Johnston said he has found support for

his efforts to change Pitt’s transgender poli-
cies.

“The FBI investigation was a serious set-
back [to the case preparations]. But I have
seen a tremendous level of community sup-
port. A lot of peopleadmire us for ﬁghting
back to protect our civil rights, and that
has made all the difference to me. As I was
from the beginning, I am open to negotia-
tion with Pitt,” Johnston said. “I know a lot
of other trans organizers also want to see
things settled out of court.”

Pitt declined to comment on its respons-
es to the complaints.

“Pitt does not comment on pending liti-
gation,” Pitt spokesman Robert Hill said on
Tuesday. “The University has not discrimi-
nated against an"yone.”

Professor Irene Frieze, previously
poised to head the ad hoc committee before
its postponement, said the committee can’t
begin its work while litigation is in play be-

LAWSUIT

complaint alleges that the Big East
forfeited the right to enforce that wait-
ing period against it because the league 
did not enforce the same waiting period ,
against WVU and TCU. A
Pitt is also seeking monetary dam-
ages from the conference. Pitt is asking
the Big East to pay $250,000 because it
had to buy out its contract with Southern
Florida to make room for a game against
TCU.
When TCU left the conference, Pitt

paid Gardner-Webb University $320,000
to take that roster spot. Pitt wants the

Big East to pay for both fees, as well as
compensate Pitt for losses in ticket sales,
because Gardner-Webb is a less attrac-
tive draw than T CU. -

However, the Big East’s ﬁling from
June 4 to move the case to federal court
said that the reason T CU decided not
to join the conference was due to Pitt’s
decision to leave the conference early.

TCU had a clean departure because it
wasn’t yet a member of the conference
and didn’t have to pay the $5 million
exit fee.

West Virginia faced a back-and-
forth lawsuit between the Big East, but
eventually settled out of court for $20
million. I

Zombie Apocalypse Now:

   

 

2--3.

Rosie McKinley
For The Pitt News

The widely talked-about freak
attack stories of last week — the
Florida face eating, the Maryland
heart eating — brought to the na-
tional stage one of America’s odd
fascinations: zombies. But those
who speak of our zombie tradi-
tion as a casual exercise commit
a mortal error: Our widespread
fascination with zombies has be-
come an alternative to religious
doctrine on life and death.

Last week in particular put our
fascination with the undead on
full display, as reports of “zom-
bie-like” activity lit up the Inter-
net. In places as diverse as Miami,
New Jersey and Maryland, freak
crimes have us contemplating the
presence .of a mystic living dead.
Reports ‘of a face-eating man or a
heart-craving college roommate
convinced the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention to release
an official statement claiming
that the agency “does not know
of a virus or condition that would
reanimate the dead (or one that
would present zombie—like symp-
toms).”

Pitshurgiombie Walk participan exprss her usiasm fo

rthe

If the federal words were an

‘ attempt to reassure the public,

they largely failed. Popular re-

ports on the Web indicate that

the general population feels
that just because the CDC doesn’t
know of a zombie-causing virus
doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist.
Indeed, the govemment’s need
to seriously address the issue of
zombies only further legitimizes
the fascination.

We are fascinated by zombies.
Case in point: Netﬂix. Alongside
the limited selection of critically
acclaimed blockbuster ﬁlms,
such as “The Curious Case of
Benjamin Button” and “Forrest
Gump,” the movie service lists a
huge selection of C—rated zombie
ﬁlms — 55 pages of them, to be
exact.

Zombies dominate not only
people’s movie choices, but also
their behavioral choices. Each
year, thousands of people partici-
pate in zombie parades and zom-
bie proms. Even weddings can
adopt a zombie air. A Bride and
groom can share their ﬁrst bite
of an arm cake that oozes out a
thick red icing. On our own cam-
pus — as well as campuses
throughout the nation ——

Freak Crimes and the Living Dead

A

undead. Matt Shuck | For The Pitt News

   

thousands of Nerf-gun-wielding
college students play the game
Humans vs. Zombies.

Our fascination with zom-
bies is nothing new. The ﬁrst-
ever zombie ﬁlm was released in
1932. The ﬁlm, “White Zombie,”
depicts black Haitians chasing a
white woman and mainly served
as government propaganda to
further convert racist fears into
political support for an American
military invasion of Haiti.

Zombie fascination has affect-
ed many places, but it’s especially
relevant to the history of Pitts-
burgh. This is where the biggest
series of zombie movies was.ini—
tially imagined. George Romero,
the so—called “Godfather of Zom-
bies,” was a student at Carnegie
Mellon and worked on the set
of “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood”
when he decided to enter the hor-
ror—ﬁlm industry. His 1968 ﬁlm,
“Night of the Living Dead,” ﬁlmed
in Pittsburgh, became a cult clas-
sic and serves as an important
benchmark in the zombie-ﬁlm
industry.

With video games like “Left
4 Dead” currently selling mil-

lions of copies, there’s no sign the long his-
tory of zombie fascination will close any-
time soon. But if college students continue
to ﬁre Nerf pellets at their zombie class-
mates for years to come, a long—standing
question must be addressed: Why are we
so hypnotized by mystic beings caught be-
tween life and death?

Perhaps we ﬁxate on zombies because
they provide an alternative to the ﬁnality
of death. Existing between the vivacity of
life and the unconsciousness of death,
zombies boldly contradict the clear divide
between the alive and the dead.

A Those bandanna—clad Humans vs.

      

Zombies players might appear to be wildly provide millions of modern Americans

imaginative children, but they more accu- with a way out of the confusion.

rately resemble a ‘
a postmodern
community of
believers fas-
cinated by the
undead. Who is
to say a belief
in zombies is
any more wildly
unrealistic than
the ancient
Greek belief in
the great gods

A bride and groom
can share a bite of an
arm cake that oozes

thick red icing.

While reli-
gious doctrine at-
tempts to assuage
our fears of death,
zombies stand
in opposition to
death. Our com-
mon fascination
with zombies sug-
gests a common
dissatisfaction
with our various
faiths and beliefs.
We do not share

of Olympus? For
centuries, humans have contemplated the
stark division between life and death. Ex-
isting somewherein the middle, zombies

a universal religion, but we do share a de-
sire for an alternative to the living-or—dead
structure that religious doctrine provides.

The outrageous nature of zombies
only makes it more of a viable alternative
to what our priests or imams may tell us.
Zombies are just impossible enough that
we don’t feel blasphemous imagining
them. We can feel comfortable considering
their existence because it never appears as
a legitimate challenge to our much more
accepted beliefs injesus or Muhammad.

The presence of zombies on Netﬂix,
television shows and video games allows
us to imagine a medium between living
and dying. These trancelike beings allow
us to blur the otherwise clear division of
existing and not. So bring on the zombie
walks, epic fake battles and rotting ﬂesh
makeup. Zombies may not be realistic, but
neither is resurrection.

FILM REVIEW

‘Snow Wliite’

“Snow White and the Huntsman”
Directed by: Rupert Sanders

Starring: Kristen Stewart, Chris Hemsworth
and Charlize Theron

Grade: B-

Natalie Bell
Senior Staﬁ Writer

When men go into battle, they take their
strength and wits. When women go into battle,
they take their beauty.

Or so the new twist on an old tale, “Snow
White and the Huntsman,” would have you
believe. While the story centers on the question
“Who’s the fairest of them all?” and appear-
ances play an inevitable role, the ﬁlmmakers
may have taken the dark queen’s lament too
much to heart.

This movie will leave viewers wondering:
Are either of these powerful female characters
really empowered at all?

The plot, unraveled in striking visuals,
follows the perverse relationship between
Ravenna (Charlize Theron) and her stepdaugh-
ter, Snow White (Kristen Stewart). Ravenna
is a gorgeous and magical power—seeker who

 worms herway into men’s hearts before steal-
 ing their kingdoms. Snow White is the beautiﬁil

and pure-hearted daughter of one of Ravenna’s
victims who has been locked in a tower since
her childhood.

When Ravenna discovers she needs Snow
White’s heart to stay beautiful and powerful, it
gives the princess a rare chance to escape and
run into the dark woods. When a huntsman
(Chris Hemsworth) hired to ﬁnd Snow White
decides to save her instead, the story of the
two great beauties’ feud unfolds -— both need
the other to die in order to succeed.

And therein lies the problem. This entire
ﬁght is not really based on who should rule the
kingdom but on some adolescent quarrel over
who’s the prettiest. Aside from comments on
the dark or light nature of their powers, most
of the ﬁlm’s characters can only talk about
Ravenna’s and Snow White’s physical appear-

" ances. (Though such an angle on female power

won’t come as asurprise to anyone who’s read
about Hillary Clinton’s headbands and power
suits or any female Fox News anchor’s legs.)
Ravenna’s power lies entirely in her appear-
ance, as demonstrated by her constant, literal
need to feed on the youth of other women. Her
magic correlates with her beauty -— the older
(read: uglier) she is, the more her powers wane.
She explains this by very bluntly recounting
how her beauty took her from rags to riches.
Kingdom by kingdom, she made kings fall
for and marry her before killing them and
taking over their thrones. This doesn’t do the
ﬁlm’s men any favors, either, suggesting they’re
made hopelessly stupid with lust and willing to

f _a spell cast by her mother.

ARTS and ENTERTAINMENT

a new, shallow interpretation of an old tale

 

Kristen Stewart (left) as Snow White and Charlize

let their kingdoms suffer their dethronement
for a physical relationship.

Of course, the movie implies that Ravenna’s

maneuver would take smarts and charm, but

_ we can’t respect her for working the system

because she’s supposed to be evil. She doesn’t

have the wide—eyed niceties of Snosmgilvhite, 

nor is she chosen by prophecy. Even Rla§enna’sl
‘tempting looks are no more than the result of

Essentially, without natural beauty, fate V

or naive kindness, Ravenna deserves to be
dethroned. She’s a terrible, mean—hearted
character, but that comes from the inherent
unfairness of living in a place where all she has
as a woman are her good looks. Perhaps it’s
Charlize Theron’s engaging performance that
even brings this issue to light —- the queen is
mesmerizing to watch. ‘

Snow White poses a threat because she is
“fair” — a winning combination of beauty
and purity. This manifests itself in her abili-
ties to heal illnesses, charm animals and con-

 

sistently appear doe-eyed. That “fairness”
makes her the only person who can defeat
the queen, independent of demonstrating any
real characteristics of strength or leadership.
Aside from going after the queen and a single
rousing -speech, there isn’t much beyond at-
tractiveness to make her special.

Add to that Kristen Stewar’t’s uncharis—_

matic _and inexpressive performance (to be

. fair, she is characterizing a young woman

locked in a tower during her formative years)
and you have a pretty lame heroine.

Snow White barely saves herself. Yes, she’s
brave, but she’s also pretty helpless. It’s the
Huntsman getting her out of trouble, men
beguiled by her rank and beauty and a pre—as-
sembled military that really get her anywhere.
Conversely, the queen has total power over the
only man currently in her life, her brother.

Snow White is good because she’s kind,
pretty and allows men to help her. The queen
is evil because she’s ambitious, has to work
for those good looks and controls men. What

eron (right) ath darl ueen Raena 1 MC Cpus

    

a tragic world where a woman’s only power
is her appearance, but she is damned for ex-
ploiting it.

Much like our own society’s, this fairy tale
world’s problems stem from and are solved
by a preoccupation with youth and beauty.
Ravenna’s grip on her throne weakens with
age (again, read: loss of good looks) and Snow
White comes into her power as she comes of
age and, conveniently, into her looks.

inevitably, both characters, no matter how
much power they gain, are disempowered.
They’re totally reliant on how attractive people
gauge them to be. And the men simply hand
power to the prettiest woman. E

Worse still, the ﬁlm doesn’t grapple with
these issues, but rather embraces this idea and
perpetuates it. There’s some talk of “spirit”
and “strength,” but everyone’s pretty much
content to live in this shallow society.

Maybe Ravenna’s bitterness wasn’t * as
unjust as the ﬁlmmakers made it out to be,
after all. I

ALBUM REVIEW

Monotonous mzckspldgue Sivitz} new album

Under a Blueberry Moon

Adam Sivitz

Cobblesound Recording Company

Grade: B-

Sounds like: sitcom theme songs without
lyrics, elevator music, the ocean

Anna Weldon
Aé-‘IE Editor

A combination of a variety of instruments
and strings of rhythms fuse to create Adam
Sivitz’s smooth album, Under a Blueberry
Moon.

The incorporation of multiple instru-
ments creates a rich sound, overﬂowing
with musical layers. Every track creates a
different tone for the album, and the vari-

ous themes allow for a surprise with every
song change.

Sivitz’s album does have its share of beau-
tiful moments. A piano solo in the middle
of “Poppy Orange” breaks up the song at an
opportune moment before transitioning into
an equally impressive violin section. These
musical inclusions make up for other points
in the album that are less impressive.

Certain tracks on’ the album seem re-
petitive in length and sound. Even with the

T small breaks between tracks, some songs are

indistinguishable from the ones surround-
ing it. The beats are too similar, and the
instrumentals used to accompany them are
not as we1l—developed as displayed on other
tracks, making some tracks dull.

Because of the album’s consistently
soothing sound, Sivitz accomplishes a con-
stant theme that helps the tracks to ﬂow.

But its lack of vigor leaves certain moments
boring and drags the album on for too long.

But that does not mean Under a Blueber-
ry Moon is inconsistent. There is a constant

, upbeat feel to the music, creating positive

energy from start to ﬁnish. The tracks com-
bine to create a blend of soft, unassuming
music, with complementary beats and melo-
dies that form the consistent album-

Still, there is something to be said for
an album that completely eliminates lyrics.
Under a" Blueberry Moon incorporates only
various instrumentals on top of Sivitz’s steel
pan, drums and percussion beats. He carries
the melodies with this set of rhythms.

Sivitz’s album meets expectations in cer-
tain categories but falls behind in its lulling
sounds and typical-tones. It does demon-
strate a possibility for growth, though, and
offers listeners a pleasant experience. I

CLUB SPGRTS

SPQ..._...R...__..........TS 

Club baseball advances to NCBA World Series 

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

After the Pitt club baseball team lost it it

 

opening game in the double-eliminatiot
North Atlantic Regional Tournament. oi.

May 11, senior inﬁelder Alex Weine

spoke to his teammates. . 7

“We were really disappointed in our-
selves,” Weinert said of the 2-0 loss to
Massachusetts that put Pitt on the brink
of elimination. “So coming into the next
game, I brought the team together and
said we had worked too hard practicing
late nights to let the season end like that. I
think that got us motivated.”

The Panthers responded to Weinert’s
words by crushing Drexel the next day, 16-
1, to stay alive in the tournament. And Pitt
wasn’t done winning.

Thanks to a dramatic -victory over ri-
val Penn State and a pair of revenge wins
against Massachusetts, the Panthers won
the North Atlantic Regional to earn the
program’s ﬁrst-ever trip to the National
Club Baseball Association Division I World
Series, where Pitt would reach the semi-
ﬁnals before its national championship
dreams were ﬁnally ended.

Pitt head coach Rob Perkey said he no-
ticed a difference in his team’s conﬁdence
and execution in the games following the
loss to Massachusetts. C

“Losing that ﬁrst game put us in a tough
situation, but our team battled back and
played the way we’re supposed to in the
next four games,” he said.

With the limited ﬁnances that come
with being a club sports program that was
just founded in 2005, the Panthers drove
south to Georgia for the World Series. But
senior inﬁelder Brandon Uram said the
lengthy car ride was simply a part of what
made the week memorable for him.

“The car ride down with some of my
best friends in college, playing baseball
almost every day and hanging out with
the team on off days after wins — it was a
great experience, overall,” he said. “Other
than winning it all, you really can’t ask for
much more out of a week.”

Enjoying the experience and riding
the momentum from the success at the
regional tournament, the Panthers,‘ who

were seeded seventh out ofthe eight teams "

at the double—e1imination World Series in
Columbus, Ga., upset Texas Tech, 10-7,
and perennial club baseball powerhouse

Colorado State, 8-6, to advance to the

semiﬁnals.

V Uram said that despite knowing many
expected the Panthers to lose those ﬁrst
two games and get knocked out early, the

team always believed it had the ability to
go deep in the World Series.

“After the way we had played at region-
als, we thought that we had a legitimate
shot at winning ’ the national champion-
ship,” he said.

Two wins from that championship, Pitt
once again faced the experienced Colorado
State team in the semiﬁnals on May 29, af-
ter the Rams advanced through the loser’s
bracket.

Weinert said the Panthers were excited
about the prospect of knocking out one of
the tournament favorites.

“They’ve won six of the last eight na-
tional championships,” he said of the
Rams. “Going into the tournament, we
wanted to face Colorado State to see what
it’s like and to see how that club is run, and
they had a great team.” ~

Because Pitt was still undefeated in the
tournament and Colorado State had suf-
fered a loss, the Rams needed to defeat
the Panthers twice to advance to the ﬁnals.
And the Rams did exactly that.’

Colorado State narrowly edged Pitt in ,

both games, by scores of 4-3 and 6-5, to ad-
vance to the nationalchampionship game
and end the Panthers’ hopes atbringing

home the trophy.

However, the Rams didn’t win the na-
tional championship, as Utah State defeat-
ed them in the ﬁnal 14-3.

“We did something
special this year
by making it to

the World Series...”
Pitt head coach

Rob Perkey

Coach Perkey said that even though his
players were devastated following the de-
feat, they can still be proud of what they
accomplished.

“With winning six games in a row and

being two wins from the national cham-
pionship, everybody was extremely conﬁ-
dent, but we weren’t able to ﬁnish it off,”
he said. “Right now we’re disappointed,
but when you take a step back and take a
different look at things, you realize that we
did something special this year by mak‘-""
ing it to the World Series and winning two
games.”

Uram described the ending of the sea-
son as “bittersweet.”

“After we made that last out and knew
Colorado State was going to the champion-» »
ship and not us, I sat on the ﬁeld for awhile
looking up at the scoreboard and thought
about what could’ve been,” he said. “But
if you would’ve told me a few weeks ago
that we’d be down at the World Series, I
would’ve taken it right then.” __

He also said he expects the Panthers 
to be back at the NCBA World Series next
season.

“I don’t see any reason why this team
next year can’t win it all,” Uram said.
“Coach Perkey is an organized guy and
puts in a lot of time. And with our come»
mitted roster and awesome alumni that
donate to the club, it’s just a really solid
organization from top to bottom.” I

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

Due to strong performances at the NCAA
East Regional Track and Field Cham-
pionships, several Pitt athletes earned
trips to the NCAA Championships in Des
Moines, Iowa, this weekend.

On the men’s side, freshman Joshua
Thompson will compete in 110—meter
hurdles event after advancing to nation-
als for the first time in his career, and
senior Jermaine Lowery will run in the
400—meter hurdles.

Pitt head coach Alonzo Webb said he
was proud of both Thompson’s and Low-
ery.’s accomplishments.

“For [Thompson] to make it as a fresh-

man is special because that doesn’t hap- ‘
pen a lot,” Webb said. “And Jermaine has J

ing for nationals in both the 10o—meter
and 200—meter dashes. After breaking
her own school record in the event at re—
gionals,Jones enters nationals as the No.
3 overall seed in the 200-meter dash.

“She’s gained conﬁdence from ev-
ery meet, and confidence means a lot in
track,” Webb said of Jones.

The women’s 400-meter relay team,
consisting of sophomores Jordan Hoyt
and Arielle Fonrose and juniors Ashley
Woodford and Jonnique Lawrence, will
also compete in Des Moines this week-
end. It’s the third consecutive year that
the Pitt’s women’s 400-meter relay team
has advanced to the NCAA Champion-
ships.

With a total of seven Panthers quali-

fying for nationals, Webb said thisehas

TASSEWS TAKE

Transforming Allie into a hitter could be risky move for Pirates

ond-round draft pickand formerly a ﬁre-
balling right-handedpiteher could
reportedly hit triple digits Jon the radar
gun and was pegged as-a future big-league
closer. The Pirates gave him a signing
bonus of $2.25 million — a recordfor a
player chosen outside of the A-first round
— even though he didn’t begirnpitching
untilvihis seynioryear.ofhighschool.  ' j '
At the tinie,“Allie=was heralded as hav-
ing the best arm in the draft but-never
developed as a pitcher at the ‘ profess-l
sional level, struggling with control and
posting a dismal 6.58 earned run average
and walking 37 batters in only 29 minor

league innings.

On Monday, the Pirates announced
that Allie was making the switch to a po-
sition player and that the experiment will
continue through extended spring train-
ing to determine which minor league_leY-
el A1lie.begin,s,playing at -as an.«eV¢iTYday

Player. - * .. ,   7'1‘-1' V   
_  This. switch has several possible’ posi-

tive and negative" outcomes; which will

likely determine if Huntington keeps this
J'obor,’I1ot.l “  n‘ 
Onthe’ plus side, Allie was a highly
rated ‘third-:b,aseprospect prior to be-

c‘o.min'g a‘ pitcher and could easily be-

come the best power—hitting prospect in
the Pirates’ system.
Yes, you heard right —~ a pitcher could

"becorne’g.,the‘ir best power-hitting pros-

pect.alfi1ost’overni’ght.

Allielis still young enough that it’s be-
lievable that he won’t be a bust and can
develop into .a solid major league hitter
and ﬁelder, something the organization
desperately needs.

‘~ The. quality of the Pirates’ pitching
prospects is high’,:l,but the position pros-

_pects sharply decline after outﬁelders
g:S,tarling Marte and Josh Bell.

"The move also comes with a lot of risk.
Allie had not even pitched for a full
minor league season before this switch

was made, and he very well could have
grown into a good pitcher, had he gotten
more experience.

The Pirates failed with a previous ex-
periment like this, when they changed
their 2001 ﬁrst-round draft pick John
Van Benschoten — who had led college
baseball in home runs at Kent State — to
a pitcher. After ﬁnding little success with
Pittsburgh, Van Benschoten became a
free agent and hasn’t played in the MLB
since.

Huntington is in a very precarious po-
sition. This is year ﬁve of his program,
and while the Pirates have shown im-
provements, they have had more nega-
tive personnel moves than positive.

Trading for Ryan Ludwick and Derrek
Lee last year was an utter failure, even if
it was nice to see the team labeled as buy-
ers at the trade deadline instead of sell-
ers.

And fans have been forced to watch
Ronny Cedeno and Clint Barmes fumble
the ball at shortstop, the LaRoche broth-
ers’ confused faces every time they swing
at and miss a curveball and an over-
weight, lazy Jose Tabata trying to beat
out a ground ball by powerwalking -
and getting a contract extension for it.

If Allie doesn’t tear up the minor
leagues for the rest of the season, Hun-

tington’s remaining time in charge could
be short. The Pirates have invested far too
much in the draft of late to not see any re-ﬁg
turns. At this point, the term “headed in
the right direction” is not enough.

The process of revamping a decimat-
ed farm system takes time, yes, but more
steady advancements must also be made
at the major league level.

The team -— like last year’s version L“

is exciting and extremely fun to watch.
But there is no doubt that the Pirates are
overachieving with their current 27-26
record.

And with such little offense at the
major league level and even less hitting
talent in the minor leagues, if the stel-
lar pitching staff hiccups even a little bit,
like last year, the Pirates’ season could
come to a very ugly conclusion.

Maybe Allie will be a better hitter than
he was a pitcher. Maybe he will become
the bat to hit behind Andrew Mccutcheﬁﬁ
down the line. Maybe the Pirates will
again be buyers at the deadline this year
and give Huntington a chance to redeem
ﬁve years of questionable player acquisi-
tions.

But for the sake of Huntington and
Pirates fans everywhere, the juice of this
Allie experiment better be worth the
squeeze. I ’
