MEN’S BASKETBALL

Pitt crushes
Clemson with
  teameffort

Tyler Pecyna
Assistant Sports,Edz'tor

The Pitt men’s basketball team was well:
ahead of Clemson by the time Talib Zanna
notched his second block, the less emphatic
of his two rejections.

Yet Zanna_strode conﬁdently toward
the bench and thrust his right ﬁst into the
electriﬁed air as the horn sounded for the
ensuing media timeout.

The Panthers —— led by 22 points, two
blocks and two steals from Zanna — em-
ployed a motoring, swarming defense and
eﬂicient ball movement offensively to shut
down Clemson and topple the Tigers, 76-
43, Tuesday night at the Petersen Events
Center.

Zanna and the Panthers (17—2, 5-1 ACC)
defended relentlessly, smothering Clem-
son’s offense to the tune of a paltry 32 per-
cent shooting from the ﬁeld. The Tigers
entered having witnessed stingy shooting,
but usually it’s a product of their defense’s
ability to thwart its opponents, who made
just 36.2 percent of field goals in 17 games.

Perhaps there’s a sting behind the Pan-
thers, one that pushed Zanna’s mitts of re-
jection into the air and left Pitt head coach
Jamie‘ Dixon and the Panthers feeling angry.

The Student Government Board has cre-

health issues just in time for cold season.
The Board replaced last year’s Fundrais-
ing and Advertising Committee with a Well-

wellness initiatives. In addition to cover

ing health issues, the Wellness Committee
will absorb any responsibilities related to
campus safety. The Facilities and Transpor-

called the Safety and Transportation Com-

and transportation, not safety.

number of committees for its term, and
the 2013 and 2014 boards formed nine
committees.

The committees work to implement
projects and improve the campus alongside
the Board.

The Fundraising and Advertising Com-
mittee previously managed SGB’s social
media accounts and was responsible for
helping to raise awareness and funds for
SGB’s and student groups’ campus events.

President Mike Nites said the Board
replaced the committee because the Board
members could handle this role without
additional help from a committee. Board
member Sara Klein will handle the respon-
sibilities of former Fundraising and Adver-
tising Committee Chairwoman Erin Worbs.

“We felt like Erin [Worbs] did a lot of
good work, but in terms of managing Twit-
ter and Facebook and making ﬂyers, it’s
something that we can just do ourselves,”
Nites said.

Worbs said she did think a Board mem-
ber could handle the advertising portion of
her role, but it would be hard.

Worbs created an Instagram and Pin-
terest account for SGB and increased the
amount of followers on SGB’s various social
media platforms.

Worbs said she increased SGB’s pres-
ence on Facebook by about 400 likes and
generated interest in SGB by advertising

Worbs, who said she posted on social media

about 300 followers on SGB’s twitter.
Although Worbs was responsible for
helping student groups fundraise, she said
only a few student groups utilized the com-
mittee’s services. '

“I deﬁnitely think if the committee were

some sort of change in how we advertise the
fundraising aspect of it to student groups,”
Worbs said. , '

(“We took the liaisons from Healthy

uana a legitimate commodity for
federal government to protect, 

Rohith Palli
Columnist

In the New York Times last week,
journalist David Brooks described
his experiences with recreational
marijuana as a young man and la-
mented the loss of what he calls
“higher pleasures” attendant to
the legalization of the drug in C01-
orado and Washington" this year.
These higher pleasures, according
to Brooks, derive largely from suc-
cess or satisfaction — they come
from the things that take time and
work to achieve and are, therefore,
the most worthwhile pursuits.

First, one must acknowledge‘
that Brooks does understand that T

measures suchas the legalization
of marijuana enhance"; rather than
detract from, freedom. However,
he has also noted that such free-
doms should sometimes be cur-
tailed for the bettermentpf society.

As acceptable and normal as

some of his arguments are, the
real thesis of Brooks’ piece feels
paternalistic, elitist and unfair.
The narrative is about how he and
his friends grew up and how, as
grown-ups, they stopped smoking.

More insidious, however, is
the classist language by which
he delivers this narrative. He de-
scribes those things that give us
purpose, such as love, achievement
and intellectual passion, as higher
pleasures.

As ‘stated, on some points,
Brooks is correct. We restrict sales
and levy sin taxes on tobacco and
alcohol precisely because curtail-
ing some freedoms can better so-
ciety. would suggest that even

imore}, extreme restrictions and

taxesjgshould be leveled against
guns.'iWe should make ﬁill use of
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, a division that was
originally part of the Internal Rev-
enue Service.

Brooks went further to insist

~ that Colorado and Washington are

“effectively encouraging drug use.”

There are a plethora of problems
with this..

First and foremost, legaliza-
tion is not tantamount to encour-
aging use, but rather, refusing to
discourage use. While it is true that
marijuana prices will plummet,
these prices will plummet as a re-
sult of relaxation of onerous gov-
ernment regulation (i.e., the sub-
stance being illegal contributed to
it being commodiﬁed on the black
market). The difference is between
something being against the law
and being subsidized: Marijuana
is not being subsidized, merely
legalized.

Second, by Brooks’ reasoning,
the government is essentially in
the business of encouraging the
use of alcohol and tobacco. In

Pennsylvania, the state government deals
liquor, which has the potential to have all
the negative effects Brooks chooses to high-

light regarding cannabis. These arguments,‘

though, have more potential than any of his
others and are not fully explicated.

While I would never contemplate not
pursuing the pleasures that Brooks de-
scribes as higher pleasures, I think every

person has the right to pursue what makes .

him or her happy. As such, it seems silly to
term an arbitrary group of said passions as

“higher.” A hipster might think that com-
peting in mainstream sports is not a higher
pleasure while Brooks would disagree.

In addition to the confused nature of I

language, I think it reveals Brooks’ limited
perspective. The experience of use that he
had with his educated friends while a high
schooler in an affluent suburb of Philadel-
phia will be very different from the experi-
ence of someone in less fortunate circum-

stances. This point is highlighted bythe

That,” as if his experiences are identical to

every other user.

Ultimately, my argument merely  A’

following: We don’t know what other people
are going through. Brooks has no idea why
someone might decide to partake of the
“lower” pleasure of marijuana. As such, it’s
not our place to contemplate such questions

' or to pontiﬁcate on how one might grow out

of such a pleasure. .

That is not to say that we shouldn’t be
concerned with preventing addiction to the
substance. Alcoholics exist in our society,
and there is a societal system in place, or at

that is supposed to help such people return

There is a lesson to be learned here.

Rather than lamenting the loss of higher
pleasures to substance abuse, we should
come up with ways to prevent substance
abuse without curtailing personal freedoms

or creatingunnecessary criminalization and ,

incarcerating numerous citizens.

This brings us full circle: The way to do
this is to levy high taxes on legalized sub-
stances and use the revenue created to fund
programs that not only rehabilitate addicts,
but also help prevent addiction in the ﬁrst
place. These steps can help create a humane,
respectﬁil policy and approach to addictive
substance regulation and management. I

MEN’S BASKETBALL

SPORTS

Unselﬁsh play assists in
blowout victory for Panthers

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

It’s rare for a shot to have any signiﬁcance
when your team has a dominant lead with
more than 15 minutes of play remaining.

But when James Robinson drove to
the basket, spun into the paint, stopped,
pivoted and tossed in a fadeaway jump
shot from about 10 feet away with 15:01
to play Tuesday night, he made a differ-
ence for the Panthers. The shot did not
make a differnce as Pitt’s 17th—made ﬁeld

goal of the day, or by giving the Panthers

a 24-point lead in what would end as a
33-point, 76-43 victory for No. 20 Pitt
against Clemson.

Instead, Robinson’s basket was the
first ﬁeld goal made by a Pitt player dur-
ing the game that didn’t follow an as-
sist from another player. This may seem
ironic, given Robinson’s reputation as,
arguably, Pitt’s most unselﬁsh player and

status as the nation’s leader in assist-to-
turnover ratio. For Robinson, his self-
lessness blends with his teammates’ on
the court. ‘

“We’re just unselﬁsh by nature,” he
said. “We’re not really keeping track of it
on the court. It’s kind of something that
just comes to us.”

After recording assists on all 16 of
its baskets, Pitt (17-2, 5-1 ACC) ﬁnished
with 24 assists on 27 made ﬁeld goals.
The assist total marks a single—game high

V for the Panthers, their best single—game

assist-to-basket ratio and, perhaps, their
most unselﬁsh game of the season.
Head coach Jamie Dixon recognized
the difﬁculty of playing unselﬁshly for
40 minutes while holding a sizable lead.
“But I thought that was an unbeliev-
able statement by our players,” Dixon
said. “They just continued to ﬁnd the

“We really motivated ourselves by their
success at the defensive end and wanted to
prove that we were that good of a defensive
team,” Dixon said. “We haven’t been be-
cause their numbers are better than ours.”

Dixon said his team didn’t change the
defensive approach, either. Put simply,
the Panthers were motivated to prove
themselves.

They looked motivated on the offensive
end too behind a sellout crowd that con-
sisted mostly of students donning white
headbands in honor of injured guard
Durand Johnson. Johnson is out for the
season following a torn A'CL.

Zanna made his ﬁrst eight ﬁeld goals,
most of which were dunks and layups
taken from underneath the hoop after
teammates worked the ball around the

court to create space.
Sophomore point guardjames Robin-
son said the team’s unselﬁsh chemistry

. made for a fun game. Pitt had 24 assists

on 27 field goals.

“When someone gives their shot up
to make a play for somebody else, it usu-
ally comes back around, and they usually
end up being on the other end of that,”
Robinson said.

Robinson found himself on both ends of
that equation, ﬁnishing with nine points,
eight assists, a steal and no turnovers.
Lamar Patterson posted 13 points, Cam-
eron Wright scored 12 and Josh Newkirk
had 10, a deep stat sheet that proves the
distribution of the wealth.

That success started early, with Pitt
jumping to a 24-10 lead after about 11 min-
utes elapsed in the ﬁrst half.

Robinson said that the Panthers “just
tried to play [their] style of game, play as
hard as [they could], [and] execute the best

.,-.s.r.v..-r.

Talib Zanna scored 22 oints in Pit’s vvin Tuésdai. Za

[they] could” from the start of the game.
“I think we did that tonight,” he said.
The dominant run was highlighted by
Zanna’s second steal, a stealth jump into
Jaron Blossomgame’s passing lane after
the Clemson forward snatched a rebound
under Pitt’s hoop. Zanna dished to fresh-
man forward Michael Young behind him,
then got the pass right back for an easy
two-handed ﬂush.
Robinson said offensive success fol-
lowing a defensive stand was a recurring
theme all night.

“Our offense comes when we make
stops on the defensive end,” he said. “We
played pretty solid defense tonight, and
that led to easier buckets on the offensive
end.”

But, as Zanna noted,Pitt’s all-around
effort wasn’t inspired completely by prov-
ing its worth against a stout Clemson (13-5,
4-2 ACC) defense.

“We were just kind of mad about the
loss we had [Saturday] against [No. 2]

Syracuse, and we were taking it out there,”
Zanna said with a calm demeanor unlike his
ﬁred-up, on—ﬂoor persona. “It was a really
big motivation, and we just try to move on.”

Zanna and the Panthers did take it
out on the court. They shot 56.3 percent
from the ﬁeld and prevented Clemson from
threatening the lead.

Before Zanna got a piece of his second
block, freshman forward Jamel Artis was
glued to Blossomgame, altering his shot
enough that Zanna had time to swoop in
and deny the attempt completely.

Dixon said that his young players had
to learn “to take pride in defense.”

“Most of these guys never thought about
what ﬁeld-goal percentage defense was
until they got here. It was like a new stat
to them, newly invented,” he said.

After Pitt’s defensive inferiority com-
plex sparked its intensity Tuesday night,
the Panthers left the court with a bit more
statistical knowledge. I

Robinson ﬁnished with a game—high
eight assists next to a clean slate of zero
turnovers, and Lamar Patterson handed
out six. By contrast, the Tigers ﬁnished
with only nine assists against 14 turn-
overs. ‘_

Four Panthers scored in double ﬁg-
. ures as a result of the collective wealth’s
distribution, led by 22 points from
Talib Zanna. Patterson scored 13, Cam-
eron Wright added 13, andjosh Newkirk
chipped in 10 off the bench.

Because of Pitt’s selﬂess play, the Pan-
thers shot 56.3 percent from the ﬁeld
against a Clemson team that entered the
Petersen Events Center ranked among
the nation’s best defenses.

“[Pitt is] a terriﬁc passing team,”
Clemson head coach Brad Brownell said.
“They make plays kind of out of nowhere
every once in a while.”

Clemson (13-5, 4-2 ACC) came to
Pittsburgh allowing its opponents to

score only 53.6 points per game on a
mere 36-percent rate from the ﬁeld and
ranked second and ﬁrst in each category
respectively.

But with more than 11 minutes left in
the second half, Pitt had already scored
54 points and ﬁnished with the highest
single-game point total of any of Clem-
son’s 18 opponents thus far.

For Dixon, the Panthers needed to
create balance; on the court. '

“We needed to be patient, but you also
needto get transition bfaskets,” Dixon
said. “We’re ateam that runs and scores

. a lot—ofpoints,t.but,obviously you have to
: be’‘~able:_t,o, wear them:diown3{;— ,. '

"2-,"Dixon:..said»;his team returned home
in with .lf‘soAm'ethingl]1i9to prove” following its

ﬁve-point loss at No. 2 Syracuse.

The Panthers’ delivered, and players
suchs-as redshirt senior Zanna beneﬁt-
ted fromthe-teamfs performance. Pitt’s
center made his’1~ﬁ7rst eight shots of the
game and ﬁnished with a game—high 22
points on 9—of~10 shooting.

The majority of Zanna’s baskets came
off feeds from Robinson and Patterson,
which set him up for plenty of clean looks

\

at dunks and layups.

“James [Robinson] and Lamar [Pat-
terson] did a good job ﬁnding me,” Zanna
said. “I was just rolling and getting bas-
kets.”

As a ﬁrst-year member of the ACC, Pitt
has held a reputation of being physical,
but following Tuesday night’s game, this
won’t be the only one preceding the Pan-
thers against their new opponents. Like
Brownell learned, the Panthers’ ability to
share the ball around the court appears
heavily on their game footage. Pitt will
be known as a generous team.

“They have elite passers,” Brownell
said. “Robinson and Patterson—1ar.g: elite

lpassers. You just.don’t  that

pass-the ball as“l‘well andiplayit
with such great poise.” » I V . .  , .

As a result of their generous and- bal-
anced approach, the Panthers surprised
one of their own as they dominated a
team they were previously tied with for
second place in the conference.

“In no way did I anticipate getting that
margin of victory against aiverygood
team that’s been playing good basket-

ieigame

Tasser’ s success leads to ACC

Wrestler of the Week honor

Redshirt Senior P..l.Tasser stands at 12-5 on the season. Bobby Mizia |Visual Editor

~ Dustin "Gabler
’ Senior Staﬁ" V Writer

The Panthers have their ﬁrst ACC Wrestler
of the Week in P.]. Tasser, but the redshirt
heavyweight senior attributed his success
to his team.

“It’s awesome to be able to win ACC-
Wrestler of the Week,” Tasser said. “But at
the same time, Iwish I could give it to all of
my teammates for the way they wrestled.”

The conference announced that Tasser

earned the honors Tuesday morning. He .

was recognized just two days after a match-
deciding 3-1 victory in overtime against
Oklahoma State’s Austin Marsden.

Tasser fought to a 1-1 tie with the ﬁfth-
ranked wrestler after regulation ran out. He
then connected on a double—1eg fakedown
in the first sudden victory period to earn
two points and the victory.

With the win, Tasser moved to 12-5 on
the season and, most importantly, secured

‘the upset victoryas the No. 13 Panthers
defeated No. 5 Oklahoma State, 19-18.

“It was a total team effort, and without
them wrestling as well as they did, I wouldn’t
have been in the situation I was in,” he said.
“It’s an awesome feeling, but at the same
time, this entire team deserved the award.
It was 100 percent a total team effort.” I
