Oakland

Planning ‘

  Welcomed

By JIM HUFNAGEL
Top representatives of. city,
county, and state government
have received the newly-

formed Oakland Corporation’s
offer to assume responsibility
for redevelopment of theOak-
land area with enthusiasm.

Pennsylvania’s Governor David
L. Lawrence, Allegheny Coun-
ty Commissioner William D.
McClel1and and.Pittsburgh Mayor
Joseph Barr, all present at Chan-
cellor Litchﬁ.eld’s unveiling of the
Corporation’s formation ‘and am-
bitions last Friday, have com-
mented favorably on the com-
pany’s purpose——t.o keep ﬁnanc-
ing of the project within the area
itself.

“However,” Mayor Barr cau-
tioned, “I would like to strongly
emphasize that it would be pre-
mature for the city or any of its
agencies to make commitments to
any developers until the plan-
ning for urban renewal in Oak-
land is completed.”

To Consider in June

Presently, the Oakland Master
Plan, announced by the Alle-
gheny Conference on Community
Development last November, must
ﬁrst be accepted by the City
Planning Commission, the Urban
Renewal Authority, the city
council and the federal govern-
ment. Consideration of the Mas-
ter Plan will begin in June.

Also, the Corporation’s de-
sire to create an industrial re-
search park in, the Upper Hill

District area is not a feature of

the Oakland Master Plan and

will have to be considered sep-
arately.

Once approved by govern-
mental agencies, the Corporation
would acquire land/from the Ur-
ban Authority and private sources,
construct improvements on it and
lease the property on a long—term
basis.

Provides Tax Income

An advantage from the city’s
point of View is that the company
would be a tax-paying enterprise
which, with the higher assessed
value of its redeveloped property,
could as much as triple the cur-
rent real estate tax income from
Oakl_and.

The Oakland Corporation in-
tends to spend $25 million of its
estimated $250 million’ budget

to buy the necessary lard, $24”

million to build office and com-
mercial space, $95 million for
housing and $7.5’ million for
parking facilities. The re-
mainder has not yet been budg-
eted, but may go toward crea-

tion of the research park.

The Corporation hopes to ac-
complish redevelopment in ten
yars shorter than the Oakland
Master Plan estimates.

sociation elected new officers re-

cently. The new President is

Registration Figures

Tahulated For Spring

Final registration figures

for the spring trimester show

that a total of 4242 graduate and undergraduate students

A plan ‘to attend.

Fall registration, which began March 19, now stands at
776 undergraduates and seven graduates.

According to the Ofﬁce of Student Records, anyone who
wants to register for the spring trimester now will be charg-
ed a late fee unless other arrangements have been made.

L. A. Leads '

The School of Liberal Arts had
the highest enrollment with 1061
students. Engineering and Mines
was next with 823 students.

In the other schools, Business
had 194; Education, 202; General
Studies, 563; Nursing, 163; and
Pharmacy, 25.

In the graduate schools, Busi-
ness had 182; Education, 343;
Engineering and Mines, 169;
Health Sciences, 3; Humanities,
101; Natural Sciences, 250;
Nursing, 29; Pharmacy, 5; So-
cial Sciences, 61; and Social
Work, 68.

Of the 776 undergraduates reg-
istered for the fall, 623 are from
the School of Liberal Arts. En-
gineering and ,Mines have 142
students, Education, 3: and Busi-
ness, 8. All seven of the graduate
students are in the School of En-
gineering and Mines. Last year
approximately 5400 students at-
tended the third trimester. Of

 these 1700 were full time.

WPGH Obtains UPI  

Teletype Machine  

Radio station WPGH has just installed a new United
Press International teletype machine which, according to
Dan Johnson, news director, should make it “as up—to-date
as any other radio station in Pittsburgh.”

The station obtained the

machine through an arrange-

ment with the College Radio Corporation. Ford Motor Com-

pany will sponsor two news pro—O

grams per night and get several
spots during‘ the day. In exchange
the company -pays for the installa-
tion and maintenance of the
machine.

There are two national services
which supply news to radio sta-
tions. Associated Press writes es-
pecially for newspapers while
UPI sends out two editions of the
news, one for papers and one
written especially for radio.

All the News

It supplies international, nation-

al, and local news and sports:

stock‘ returns; business and farm‘

reports; and features; which are
sent continuously by wire. Radio
stations in Pittsburgh receive re-
ports from Western Pennsylvania
sources, and from a central clear-
inghouse.

At present VVPGII has seven
people in its news department,
and until now they have had to
spend most of theirov time col-
lecting and typing news and re-
writing.

Now, because of the new ma-
chine, they will be free to pre-
‘sent special features along with
the news. For instance a new pro-
gram, “Meridian” is being pre-
sented at 8 p.m. Tuesday and
Thursday. It features the news and
also commentary,
special reports by the newsmen.

Johnson says of the new
system: “Now listeners from
WPGH will not be cut off from
the rest of the world. With this
news service we hope to better
serve the students at the Uni-
versity and give them not only
comprehensive, complete news,
but also the latest national and
international news.

day, they beat two of Pittsburgh’s
main stations with several items;
mostly, said Johnson, ‘because
WPGH bulletins gomore directly
to the broadcaster, not through so
many editors.

Miss Lichenstein reels that the.

that in order to encourage more

in some of the schools.

  Participate

In Exam

Approximately 600 sophomores
and seniors took the Grad—Record
Examinations which were given
by the University Testing Service

M; last Tuesday.

This is the third consecutive

‘year that the tests have been

given. They are given to Liberal
Arts sophomores having 46 to 60
credits and seniors having 105 or
more credits.

"The purpose of the examina-
tions, according to Dr.’ Albert B.
Martin, dean of the School of
Liberal Arts,‘ is to attempt to make
a definition of -what impact the
third trimester has had on the
educational# consequences of stu-
dents. They are also a check on the
good effects of" the trimester
calendar.

Compares Tests
The testing service compares the
tests of those students who have
gone two trimesters a year and
those who have gone three.

“Many people feel that the 15
week trimester has resulted in
hurrying and pressuring the
student,” Dr. Martin stated.
“One purpose of these tests in
to determine whether or not this
fact is true.” ‘

“We feel that the tests are a
better evaluation of the trimester
calendar than making a generali-
zation out of an emotional response
which might grow out of some-
thing we don’t like to do,” he con-
cluded.

_ GOVERNOR LAWRENCE, ‘Chancellor Litchﬁeld and County Com-

  

missioner William D. Mcclelland discuss the Oakland Company’s

....proposal’ for redeveloping the area.

   Tomorrow the 2 

Pittsburghers" reaction to the Oakland Corporation’s_"

intention to continue the Renaissance program '1 in unpre-
cedented style seems to be one of. delighted awe. In an

A editorial in Sunday’s Pittsburgh ‘Press, one writer reflect-
ed that, “Most of uswill have to recast ourideas to get-

used to the larger canvas ‘on which the Oakland planners
are painting.” A -
F or an area which considered the Gateway Center re-

newal an inordinately ambitious project, the announce-

ment that six institutions plan to /spend three times as
much to renovate forty times that much land must be
more than a little impressive. '

At Pitt, reaction is likely to be slightly more bl~ase.’.

An institution that can ﬁnd and spend $130 ‘million in eight
years, plan to spend $60 million more and in the process
introduce what seems to be a catchy concept in year-round
education is quite in characterlprovidingl the lion’s share
of the leadership and capital for a $250 million business.
“Today Oakland, tomorrow the world” is evolving from

. a, joking phrase to a credible slogan.

Creation of Chancellor Litchﬁeld’s “Cultural Island,”
according to the New York Times, will make Oakland’s
the largest urban renewal effort in the nation. Butthe pri-
mary. aim is not to build the biggest or even just the best,
but to provide an educational and cultural concentration
‘which canendure and grow. Institutions which have in-
vested $750 million in an area can ill afford to let encroach-
ing slums, congested traffic and sliding property values cor-
rode their investment. By banding together and eventually
cornering all real estate they hope to ﬁrst ‘stabilize and then
increase the value of their holdings. _

Private investment from outside sources might spare
the institutions initial ﬁnancial pain, but money from"un-
interested’ sources is ﬁckle——any sign of loss might result in

gwithdrawal and collapse of the project’s permanentnature. “

The result should be an on-going cultural, scientiﬁc, ed-
ucational and medical community which can attract the
top intellectual talent in the country as well as effectively
utilize’ the 2,000 Ph.D. or equivalent ‘degree holders it now

, has.

The “tomorrow” built by the next ten years’ work
might well include the world.‘

  Cure For Loneliness

By Ina Amclur

There is a new do-it-yourself craze. Loneliness,
say the magazines, can be cured. On a back page
‘of one of the less reputable scandal sheets, there
are about seven different cures for that unbear-

able human ill. Two dollars brings a list of names
and addresses of one hundred
lonely girls from the ages of
eighteen _through twenty-ﬁve.
Why be lonely? Open destiny’s
door. Results are guaranteed.
At ﬁrst one thinks it’s just
a joke. But then the question

ments would continuelto be pub-

Someone must be insensitive
enough to publish the ads, and
many people must be lonely
enough to answer them. In a society which forbids
'loneliness, by emphasizing togetherness, there are
many indications that the group spirit has not al-

togetherness, there are many indications that the .
grou-p ‘spirit has notgaltogether solved all problems.

Brown‘-paper Answers
,What is frightening and sad is that the lonely

ones of the world really think the answer to their

dreams canbe found in alist of names sent in an
anonymous brown—paper wrapper. One finds out
ghow the people are, where they live, and what
their favorite color is. The choice’ is made and
loneliness is conquered forever. Of; all the mad
delusions which men have created for themselves
through the ages, surely this is the most absurd.

 

Loneliness comesfrom a lack of communication —

among people. People go to Cocktail parties with‘

their smiles pasted on and say nothing the whole‘ ’

evening. They are all together, drinks in hand, and
all equally lonely. People sit around the television
set and live the same vicarious lives for a half
hour. But loneliness cannot be fought by cocktail
parties, television sets, or club meetings. ’
Communication in depth can only be achieved

among a small group of people. In such a situation 

all the cliches about the astronauts, about the size
of Jackie Kennedy's shoes, and about the twist

can be forgotten. Two human beings can face one a

 
  
 
    
    
        
   
   
   
 
   
 

another and speak with out the safeguards of the’« 

commonly accepted topics of conversation. It is

difficult‘ to remove the mask, but it is the only 7,

way to get out of prison. _
Communication Can Improve .

 

It is doubtful whether the isolation of one-,rnai1, 
from another can ever be completely conqueredgﬂ‘

One suspects that being lonely is as much a ‘part
of being human as having ten ﬁngers and ten toes.
But there are degrees of loneliness. Although some
aspects of humanlife and some thoughts of human

beings are : forever private, still communications‘
1 could be a lot more meaningful than it is. “When

it improves, the ads which guarantee the abolish.
ment of loneliness will -disappear from the backs
of magazines. , l _ 

Instead of sending away for additional lists of
people’ with whom one can talk about nothing, why
not try to talk earnestly “with those’ people whom
one knows without‘ the helpgof the magazines?
Loneliness will never disappear as long as human

A radio station*cannot succeed on accolades alone. I

it islto prosper, ‘advertising revenues must offset operating

expenses and WPGH is no exception. The importance. of
the campus station becoming a c‘ornrnerci'al.outlet is in-
dicated by the installation of a UPI news teletype at its
Student Union studio.

Advantagesiof the teletype itself are numerous. In-
stead of relying upon day-old stories from the Post—Gazette
and the New York, Times, news director Dan Johnson and
his staff now receive bulletins withinhours or even min-
utes of an event. The teletype thus eliminates the necessity
of clippingand rewriting dated stories and 'provides"broad-
casters with professional equipment which noticeably im-
proves. program quality. V

The advantages of. the teletype however are of second-
ary 'import_ance.. WPGH/‘utilizes the wire service -in ex-
change for" 12 weekly newscasts sponsored by the Ford
Motor Company, the ﬁrst commercial permitted by the
station “advisory” board. Since‘ the »station’s inception, no
advertising hasvbeen scheduled —- advertising which could

Because of insufficient funds, WPGH relies upon am-
ateur ..tape recorders, outdated turntables, borrowed rec-
ords, and faulty ampliﬁers to remain on the air. A station
spokesman "remarks that KQV had better equipment in

.1924 thanlWPGH uses today.‘ The station has received $400

from the speech department and a $300 grant from SG for
the new coaxial cable,,yet these funds cannot buy the
$15,000 basic equipment. needed to succeed in competition
with other college outlets for advertising contracts. Colum-
bia University, -Carnegie Tech, and Dartmouth College
have expressed interest in exchanging programs but
WPGH officials are reluctant because of substandard tech-
nical quality on locally-produced tapes.

General manager Dick Rauh foresees future member-
ship in a newly-formed college networkcomposed of 150
stations—a chain headed by outlets in New Orleans, Chi-
cago, New York, and Pittsburgh. WPGH would serve as
the central switching station for the network. Local rev-
enues from network participation and national advertising
could surpass $3500 yearly. A

Commercial advertising is the lifeblood of any radio
station. Without advertising income, future success is lim-
ited and even doubtful. WPGH possesses the talent and
ingenuity to produce quality programs of the recent “John
Glenn Homecoming” caliber, but unless the advisory board
approves commercial programming, enabling the station to
install new faCi1iti€‘S, WPGH will retain minor importance
in campus affairs, if itsurvives at all. As many organiza-
tion have, learned, frustration leads to failure

Seek Revenge
For Drubhing

Of Last Season

By LEN BERENFIELD

The Panther trackmen ini-
tiate the outdoor season this
Saturday when they travel to
meet Maryland’s Terrapins.
Not only will the Panthers be
seeking a victory in their initial
meet of the year, but they will
also be out to avenge last year’s
defeat at the hands of the Mary-
land squad.

Last season, Maryland tamed
the Cats in humiliating fashion,
104-27. The Terrapins captured
a first place in every running
event. completely outclassing the
Panthers, while also managing to
set a new Stadium record in the
pole vault.

The sting of the bitter defeat
still remains etched in the memor-
ies of Coach Rees’ squad, and will
provide added incentive to bring
home a victory.

Both Stronger

Accomplishing
no easy task, however, as Mary-
land is expected to have many of

.their standout performers return

for another crack at the Cats. On
the other hand, Coach Rees’
charges are expected to present
a stronger team than last year’s
version which posted a dismal
record.

Spearheading the Panther of-
fensive on Saturday will be Vance
Carter, Joe Friend, and Gary
Meckley. This trio provided the
Cats with a great percentage of
their points during the indoor
season, and are expected to carry
the load during the outdoor
schedule.

Last month, at the IC4A In-
door Championships, Carter took
a second place, losing out in the
600 yard run by only a tenth of
a second. Friend and Meckley
both_ took ﬁfth places in their
specialties, the 60 yard hurdles
and the pole vault, respectively.
Meckley set a new University
mark in the pole vault earlier this
year.

stacks up. If they have a lot of
right handed batters I’ll go with
one of my righties. If it’s the
other way I’ll pitch a lefty.”
Either way I think our pitching is
going to be a lot stronger than
it was lastseason.”

'I‘hin—hipped gymnast Earl McConnell disproves the all-
too-frequent belief that vocational high school students are

all brawn and no brain.

“Dancing school is responsible¢

for what I have now,” states the
Connelley Trade School -graduate.
Earl’s eleven years of acrobatic
dance instruction have _led him to
a college education, gymnastic
scholarships‘ and awards, and mar-
riage. .

The short senior had no dreams
of attending college. “If anyone
should get credit for my being in
college today,” says McConnell
earnestly, “it would be my high
school teacher W. J. Griffen who
made sure that .I'met all the aca-
demic requirements of the Univer-
sity.”

All-Around Artist

If Earl hadnft come to Pitt, he
confesses that he probably would
have persued a career in commer-

school yearbook, the young artist
had a chance to display his crea-
tive talents. Many of his works are

Being a liberal arts student
majoring in English, Earl has
the opportunity to use his crea-
tive talent in another way.
Through creative writing, this
free thinker can express his
thoughts and create verbal pic-
tures.
It is obvious after speaking with

Earl that he violently opposes, any
type of restraints on the right of
free expression. He often cites
passages from English literature
in general conversation and some-
times has to rephrase his sen-
tences due to his extensive?voc'ab-
ulary. It is not uncommon to hear
Earl say, “In other words —-— .”
BMOC At Connelley

In high school McConnell spoke
for his fellow students when he
served as Student Council‘ Presi-
dent. He also was a swimmer" and
diver for the Connelley tankers.

For two seasons,_ no diver in the

city schools defeated McConnell
in duallmeets.

Furthering his athletic abili-
ties at Pitt, the 5-6 tumbling
whiz led his team in scoring
‘and served as team captain in
the 1962 season. “I didn’t know
anything about .gymnastics,”
says Earl.

But‘ the potential was there and

 

Gym Stint 

after three years of varsity exper-
ience *McConnel.l proved himself.
He knocked off 53 competitors in
the NC-AA Gymnastic Champion-
ships at Albequerque, New Mexico
to take third place in the free ex-

ercise event.

First place honors in this event
went to Earl at the Eastern Inter-
collegiate Gymnastic League In-
dividual Championships at West
Point, New York early in March.
He also placed higher .in the na-
tionals than any other performer
from the EIGL.

Speaking of his Eastern vic-
tory, McConnell states, “You
know, I wanted that victory for
my wife more than myself. “Al-
though Earl’s devotion and,unse_1-
fishness cannot be questioned, this
champion hasshad occasion to lose
his usually calm disposition.

“Earllshows his emotion more
than any person I’ve ever coach-
ed,” says gymnastics coach War-
ren Neiger. This can be verified
by watching McConnell’s expres-
sion after he finishes a routine. It
is not necessary to watch for the

Pieces Chosen
From Studio
Courses Here

The annual show of student art
work is now on view in the Henry
Clay Frick Art Gallery. The ex-
hibits have been chosen by in-
structors from work submitted in
studio courses in the fine arts de-
partment.

Most of the students are under-
graduates and, since there is no
studio major at the University,
they come from such varied de-
partments as engineering, liberal
arts, and fine arts.

The exhibits included a variety

of mediums‘. There are pictures in -

oil, black and white ink, and
water colors; wood prints; mosaics;
and plaques. In the more solid
media there are carvings in solid
stone, plaster castings, and con-
struction in more varied mater-
ials with emphasis on pattern.

‘In style the works vary from
what is known as “hard—edge” ab-
straction to very -representational
