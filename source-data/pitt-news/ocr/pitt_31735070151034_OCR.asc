Student Government Board mem-
ber Dave Rosenthal hopes to start a
class that doesn’t include midterms,
homework or ﬁnals.

But for what it lacks in regular
college—course components, the
course makes up in practicality.

Rosenthal, who ran for election
on an initiative of creating a free,
one-credit culinary course, said the
class will target Pitt students who
live off campus or in apartment-

style dorms and want to learn.

simple, healthy and inexpensive
culinary techniques.

Pending further approval from
the University and Sodexo, the cor-
poration that oversees Pitt’s campus
dining, Rosenthal hopes to com-
mence a pilot class during the ﬁrst
week of April.

With the experience of living
off—campus in Central Oakland last
year, Rosenthal knows ﬁrsthand the
difﬁculty of transitioning from liv-
ing in dorms and surviving on meal
plans to fumbling around with oven
mitts and stovetop knobs.

“Oftentimes, students who live
off campus are somewhat forgot-
ten about, but a large majority of
the student body lives in an off'--
campus residence or in one of the
apartment-style housing options
offered by Pitt,” Rosenthal said in
an email. ‘

This semester, Rosenthal met

Pitt law school honors distinguished alum

Megan Trimble
Assistant News Editor

As Pitt law students study civil
rights on the ﬁfth—ﬂoor of the

S Barco Law Library and l.eave its

comfort to engage with the com-
munity, they ‘will have a steady
reminder of the history behind
their missions. . O ,
Legal scholar and Pitt Law
alumnus Derrick Bell’sr memory
was honored Wednesday after-
noon as the Black Law Students
Association ofﬁcially renamed
their annual legal clinic —— which
provides legal assistance and re-

sources to lower-income mem-
bers of the community — the Der-
rick Bell Community Legal Clinic.
During a surprise announcement,
Pitt Law Dean William Carter Jr.
declared a portion of the school’s
ﬁfth—ﬂoor library the Derrick A.
Bell Constitutional Law Com-
mons. Bell died from carcinoid
cancer on Oct. 5, 2011 at the age
of 80. e l

About 30 students, faculty, _

members of the Bell family and
Bell family friends gathered in
the Alcoa Room of the Barco Law
Building to witness BLSA’s pre-
sentation of the honor to the Bell

family and the unveiling of the
commons-area memorial.

Bell was the only African-
American in his graduating law-
school class of 140 students in
1957, was one of just three black
students in the school at the time
and acted as associate editor—in-
chief of the University of Pitts-
burgh Law Review. In 1971, Bell
became the ﬁrst tenured African-
American professor at Harvard
University Law School.

As a law professor, Bell re-
ceived acclaim as one of the
leading critics of traditional
civil rights discourse, as well as

through his engagement in civil
disobedience during his time at
Harvard and the University of Or-
egon law schools. He published
several books over the course of
his lifetime, including “Race,lRac—
ism and American Law,” which has
become a fundamental textbook
in law schools.

Janet Bell graciously accepted
the dedications and said her hus-
band’s legacy was one of “serious
scholarship and a dedication to
the law as a means to achieve so-
cial justice.” Above all, she said

Bell was focused on students dur-
ing his almost 50—year teaching
legacy. ,

“He never saw teaching as a
one—way street,” she said. “He al-
ways viewed it as a shared learn-
ing enterprise and participatory
learning.”

Janet said that while this places
a lot of the learning responsibil-
ity on students, he always said he
knew they were up for it.

Derrick Bell spent the ma-
jority of his teaching career at
Harvard Law, but Janet said her
husband always thought of Pitt
as his “home school” and had a
“long and loving relationship”
with the University, to which he
later returned as guest lecturer.

Derrick A. Bell III said he was
pleased that his father’s memory
was honored and said the family
was proud of his father’s accom-
plishments.

March 21 , 2013 1 The PM News l.vwvw.piiinevvs.com

“He did real well, and he was
sort of pioneering for the people
of the future,” the younger Bell
said.‘

Dean Carter said the commons
area will act as a “permanent and
lasting reminder” of Bell’s interest
in civil rights and social justice.

Chris Carter, a second—year law
student and BLSA Vice president,
presented a memorial token to
Janet Bell and spoke from experi-
ence on the impact that Bell has
on law students.

Chris Carter said his father
always taught him about race
conﬂict and African—American
history. When he decided to pur-
sue law, his father suggested he
learn about Bell. Because Bell was
from the Hill District and Carter
grew up nearby in Homewood, the
current law student felt a connec-
tion to the activist’s story and ul-
timately chose to attend Pitt Law.

“I said, ‘I’m going home. I just
have to,’” he said.

Chris Carter shared some of
Bell’s activism history with the

. ..—.,— .w M 93:» -'1 re» A

group.

Bell protested on behalf of
those who, he felt, were unfairly
treated. In 1986, he resigned from
his position as Dean of Oregon
Law in protest of the school’s re-
fusal to hire an Asian—American
female professor. Upon returning
to Harvard Law, he conducted a
ﬁve—day sit-in until the school ac-
knowledged two female minority
professors for tenure positions.

“He put his entire career on
the line and the students stood
by him,” Chris Carter said. “That
speaks volumes of his legacy’s im-
pact on students.”

The Bell family made a mon-
etary gift to the law school, and
Dean Carter said the University
will use the gift to continue Bell’s
work. Among several proposed
initiatives, Dean Carter said the
schoolwill work to build upon the
gift, encourage the matriculation
of diverse students to study social
justice and develop a research fel-

of Operations, and Meg Mayer—Costa, Pitt’s

for teaching students about food and food
safety,” Rosenthal said.

Not only will the course cover food prepa-
ration, Rosenthal said, but also a number of
other culinary basics.

“Ideally, the courses will be an hour long
and can cover everything from food expira-
tion, cooking supplies, where to get groceries,
as well as including various recipe options
that students can make, on a college budget,”
Rosenthal said. ‘

Mayer— Costa consults with students about
their personal nutrition needs through Stu-
dent Health Services, and said she under-
stands the need for nutrition education. She
said college-age students are at an age when
they experience signiﬁcant mental and physi-
cal growth, and this requires“-a steady and
sensible diet.

“When students move off campus and be-
gin to take even more responsibility for their
nutritional needs, they require education in a
variety of subjects, including shopping, bud-
geting, preparation, food safety and cooking
skills,” Mayer—Costa said. ‘ ,

Mayer—Costa, along with members of Pitt’s
Student Dietetic Association, will curate and
present nutritional information at the classes.
She said they’re currently developing acur—
riculum for the program that includes sea-
sonal themes and healthful recipes.

“We hope to have one to two classes of an
hour or so before the end of this term and
then, based on interest, move to a broadened
curriculum for the fall,” Mayer-Costa said.

Although she had some plans for the pro-
gram, Mayer—Costa said she wanted students
to contribute their own ideas, as well.

Bauman was unwilling to comment on
the status of Rosenthal’s initiative because
it is still in the preliminary planning stages.

Rosenthal’s.project is linked with other
incentives, including the initiative run by fel-
low SGB member Amelia Brause of expanding

‘ the Healthy U program, which is a sector of

Pitt’s Student Affairs Department that focuses
on helping students improve their physical
and mental health. A number of Healthy U
ﬁtness classes initially started as single, one-
hour sessions that the academic dean’s ofﬁce
eventually approved to become traditional
one-credit courses.

Rosenthal has not yet contacted the dean’s
office, but hopes that these classes will gar-
ner enough interest to be included in Pitt’s
curriculum. , j

“The next step will be ﬁnding funding for
the classes, nailing down a time and place,
and then [launching] advertisement for the
classes to the student body,” Rosenthal said.

Seniors Paige Grifﬁths, an environmental
studies and political science major, and Lisa
Chesko, a global management major, wish,

‘that’ cooking classes had been offered before
their last year at Pitt. V ‘ A ' V

“It’s a really good idea, since younger stu-

dents can’t cook in their dorms. And once they
move to apartments off-campus, they don’t
know how to cook,” Chesko said..

Griffiths and Chesko, who live off campus,
love to bake and cook at least oncea week.

“Most students probably don’t know how

to cook, because their moms always did it for

them,” Griffiths said. I

COLUMN

To mend gender disparity in primary

education, consider behavior as a factor

Eric Baldwin
Columnist

Public primary education is fail-
ing on a global scale, and evi-
dence indicates that boys are
more often the victims of this
system than girls. Traditionally,
researchers have attempted to
explain the gap between male
and female performance as a

question of intelligence, primi— ,

tive instinct and ability to un_—
derstand certain tasks better
than others. Recently, however,
a radically new explanation for
gender disparity in education
has emerged from a set of re-
searchers conducting a joint
project between Columbia Uni-
versity and the University of
Georgia.

Traditional studies have at-
tempted to explain the disparity
in male and female education in

the K-5 range in ways that all ne——

glect “noncognitive skills” and
fail to recognize factors outside;
the control of the pupil.pThis
new explanation understands
the disparity as an issue of be-
havioral difference between the
genders. While this may seem
similar to a traditional expla-

nation, it differs in one critical
facet: It points out that class-
room instructors might perceive
behavioral difference as an indi-
cator of intelligence and perfor-
mance. Classroom instructors,
whether consciously or subcon-
sciously, used their arbitrary
perceptions in their discretion-
ary grading. The research proj-
ect states the gap between stu-
dents’ standardized test scores
and classroom grades: While
boys outperformed girls in sci-
ence and math on standardized
tests, on average, girls’ class-
room grades were signiﬁcantly
better than boys’.

According to the study, these
perceptions mostly consist of
observations of students’ non-
cognitive skills, including atten-

—tiveness, persistence, attention
span and willingness‘ to learn.
Although they are difficult to as-
sess or calibrate with any stan-
dardized metric", all of these are
areas in which boys seem to be
perceived as lacking. Boys tend
to become distracted easily, dis-
tract others, give up more eas-
ily than girls when working on
tasks and are often uninterested
in new material.

The researchers concluded

that the origin of the disparity
lies within the grading by teach-
ers. Although boys exhibit less
or more tumultuous patterns
of the aforementioned noncog-
nitive skills, when they were
graded irrespective of their be-
havior, they did just as well as
their female classmates and in
line with how their test scores
indicated they should perform
in the classroom.

If the origin of gender dis-
parity in education occurs at
such a young age because of
discretionary grading methods
of elementary school teachers,
this discussion needs to focus
on how to address inadequate
classroom grading measures.

Instead of providing remedial
services for boys to “catch up”
to girls,lshouldn’t we implement
remedial services forteachers
who grade unfairly and start
training new teachers to be
aware of these differences? And

coupled with this, classroom in-

struction styles should be re-
conﬁgured to accommodate for
boys’ noncognitive behavioral
differences. ’

Critics of thisapproach claim

that teachers should not be blamed. They
argue that in early education, there is a
lack of work produced that can be mea-
sured and graded according to standards
found in middle and high schools, and
that a teacher’s discretionary grading
is inherent and necessary in the pro-
cess. Following this, critics claim that
if boys are unable to focus and are eas-
ily distracted, then it is their own fault,
and that in high school, college and the
workplace, those types of behaviors are
considered unacceptable. However, it is

 

March 21 , 207 8 1 The Pitt News J ,\/\N\/\/\/.plllﬂ@WS.COfTI

important to remember that the children
being discussed are between four and
10 years old, not adolescents or adults.
I do not propose blaming teachers for
this disparity; from a personal point of
view, I can imagine perceiving students
as not doing as well if they are easily
distracted and uninterested or unwilling
to learn. What is needed is the creation

-_of a grading system for young children

that recognizes these behavioral differ-

ences and values academic milestones
and achievements at any level, rather

than limiting potential by overvaluing

perceptions of a student’s behavior.
With grade disparities between

genders arising at such an early stage,

negative repercussions can affect how
male students feel about themselves and
therefore reinforce untrue sentiments
that they can’t perform well in school or
aren’t smart enough for academic work.
Grades carry far more weight in high
school and college placement and self-
esteem of students than do standardized
test scores, and ifgrades are inaccurate
and reﬂective of teachers’ arbitrary grad-
ing, then generations of male students
might be undervalued in terms of aca-
demic potential. 

Though I am not in a position to pro-
vide recommendations abouthow to rec-
tify arbitrary grading by primary school
teachers and reconfigure curricula to

help young boys reach their potential,
I can claim that change is needed. Ac-
cording to the research project, girls are
outpacing boys not only in early educa-
tion, but also in terms of high school
graduation rates and college gradua-
tion rates. Women also outpace men in
terms of Ph.D. cohorts and completion
rates. A

The evidence indicates that this stems
from subtle disparities at the very earliest
stages. If we can rectify early education
for boys, then perhaps boys can catch up
to girls at later stages, and the playing
field can become more equal.

The 20/20 Experience

Sounds like: A futuristic version
of classic soul and funk; Justin
Bieber finally has some male
competition in pop music
Grade: A

The man who “brought sexy back” is out to
introduce a touch of class and romance to the
pop scene this time around with The 20/20
Expmeme.

After a seven—year hiatus, Justin Timber-
lake has returned to the music scene with his
new album, a 1o-song follow-up to 2oo6’s
well-received headboard-knocker and out-
right panty— dropper, Futz1re5ex/ Lovefozmelr. Af-
ter his extended hiatus, Timberlake returned
to music in his slim Tom Ford suit and tie,
delivering heartfelt lyrics and beats that are si-
multaneously timeless and ﬁituristic with the
help of longtime producer Timbaland (“Cry
Me a River,” “My Love” and “LoveStoned”).

While The 20/20 Expmenee is wholly sat-
isfying, Timberlake avoided simply record-
ing danceable tracks obviously intended for
radio success. Instead, he opted for a more
mature sound that takes a bit of time to truly
appreciate. The album’s 10 songs get better

i with each listen.

Timberlake fans may lament the general
lack of songs with the same immediacy of _

past J.T. hits such as “Like I Love You” and
“SexyBack” -— two songs that forced you to
run to the nearest dance ﬂoor. The 20/ 20 Ex-
perzence aims to make passionate love to your
ears as opposed to dance—centric Fuz‘ureSex/

such as “Pusher Love Girl,” “Strawberry Bub-

at their midpoint, replacing the ﬁrst half’s
soulful melodies as Timbaland’s signature
futuristic beats take center stage. Though
familiar, Timbaland’s beats sound fresh with
the use of more organic instrumentation as
opposed to the abundant electronic tones that
appeared on Fu2‘ure5ex/Lozzefomzdrf

berlake’s occasional beatboxing, one of his
signature sonic elements. What sounded so
inventive on early career hits such as “Like
I Love You” comes off as a bit dated today.

Tbe 20/20 Eagberie/zee opens with a true
standout in the form of “Pusher Love Girl,”
a song that ﬁnds Timberlake crooning to his
signiﬁcant other about her drug—like qualities
(“So high I’m on the ceiling/ Baby, you’re my
drug”). Next comes Timberlake’s successﬁil
lead single, “Suit 8: Tie,” an ode to the ﬁner
things in life. “Suit & Tie” features the album’s
sole guest artist, Jay-Z, who adds a few lines
about “truffle season” and wearing “Tom Ford
tuxedos for no reason.” The Verse seems un-
necessary and the rap stands out too much
against Timberlake’s soft vocals. It adds little
to the track.

The middle part of the album ﬁnds “Straw-
berry Bubblegum,” a sugary-sweet love song
with some not-so-subtle sexual references
involving candy metaphors such as, “If you’d
be my strawberry bubblegum / then I’d be
your blueberry lollipop.”

“Tunnel Vision” ﬁnds Timberlake singing
about a special lady, one that stands out in a
room full of beautiful people. Similarly, the
song stands out on the album. The produc-
tion feels less throwback and more modern.
It will surely please Fu2‘ureS ex/ L01/e.S‘oumirfans
who enjoyed the album’s n1idtempo smash,
“Lovestoned.”

The end of the album serves as the home to

ALBUM REVIEW

Moving lyrics, infectious sound ﬁll Phosp

For The Pitt News

Muchacho

Phosphorescent

Sounds like: A less pop—y Ed-
ward Sharpe and the Magnetic
Zeros

Grade: A-

Phosphorescent’s new album, Mm/me/90, is a
sensory trip through lazy afternoons, heartache
and timid intimacy. I -
Matthew Houck, the one—man makeup of
Phosphorescent, has put out seven albums since
2001, but he has never gotten too big for his
britches. On Mu:/me/30, the singer’s tremulous
but reassuring tone whets the listener’s inter-
est rather than forcing it as he strides his way
through raw, emotional lyrics. On the whole,

Houck’s newest album exudes a humble yet
noticeable conﬁdence.

As early on as “Song for Zula,” a six-minute
spread of hauntingly serene self—deprecation
that constitutes the album’s second track, it’s
very easy to understand Phosphorescent’s style.

Many ofMue/Jae/yo s songs startwith a gradual
build that lays the groundwork for the warming,
atmospheric comfort of Houclés instrumental
and vocal performances.

Songs such as “Ride On / Right On” are per-
fect for this time of the year, when the seasons
are changing. His vocals ‘are introduced amid
a hazy mix of guitar riffs and clap-along drum
beats. It’s shy atﬁrst, like the sun as it begins to
peek-out from the grey, cold clouds of winter.
Each line of the song either ends with “right
on” or “ride on,” and the titular repetitiveness
reaches its apex around the two-minute mark,
at which point Houck starts to slam the listener
with compounded catchiness in the form of
infectious sing-along vibes.

 

horescent’s new release

Phosphorescent has released seven albums but still maintains its original sound.

“Down to Go,” Muchacho’s penultimate
track, takes a different approach, conjuring

patrons. Piano keys gingerly provide a frame-

Rules of thumb for festival—goers

help to improve experience

Festival attendees at coacheila sing along to live music. MCT Campus

Kira Scammell
PVPTS Contributor

South by Southwest ended on Saturday, and
Coachella is less than a month away — and

_g these are just two of many music festivals that

will occur in the upcoming months. Festival
season has begun. V: .
In comparison to the cost of a traditional

S vacation, festivals offer a ﬁnancially viable op-
’ tion to experience aweekend awa§ifrom»reality.

Not all festivals are created equal, and levels
of commitment and preparation by organiz-
ers and attendees vary. Music is at the core of
the experience, but anyone who has gone to a
festival knows that you’re in for more than just
one long concert.

There are two important festival rules that
all attendees should be conscious of: be open-
rninded and be prepared. There’s no rule that
says you have to be as openasthe festival attend-
ees at Burning Man, but preparation is a must.

Most festivals require attendees to camp
out on small lots for the duration of the festival,
meaning no electricity, running water or solid
shelter. If you’re not a camper, this probably
sounds less than appealing. Here are nine tips
to make your festival experience better:

1. Drink water. V - 

And lots of it. Most activities?-take place in
the hot summer sun. There are few stations for
water, so make sure to carry a bottle with you
and reﬁll it often. This is especially. important if
you’ll be partaking in intoxicating substances,
which increase the chance of dehydration.

2. Arrive early and leave early;

Notice in your festival experiences that the
latecomers always get stuck  to the porta
potties. Also be wary of setting up camp by a
comer -'— people hate’wall<ing*a‘Ifid love peeing
in corners. ' ' T. _,_ A

Arriving earlywill give you less about

leaving early, and after a couple straight days
of festival ﬁm, the last thing on your desired

V agenda will be waiting in line as everyone tries

to leave the festival at the same time. So do
yourselfa favor and pack it up before everyone
heads out if you don’t mind missing the last
couple of bands.

3. Bring a totem and/or someone tall.

Disorientation is inevitable, especially since
a tent looks like every other one in a crowd of
several hundred. Put something up at yours so
walking back to your camp doesn’t turn into a
scavenger hunt, and have something one tall
member of the group can carry over his head so

_ any Wanderers ﬁnd their way back. Nothing is

worse than looking into a sea of tents that look
exactly like yours.

4. Expect to have zero cell service.

Mobile networks overload easily when ev-
eryone tries to use them at once in the same
area, especially if the area isn’t typically very
populated, and some festivals are in isolated
locations that may not have service to begin

with. There likely won’t be a place to charge '

your phone, anyway.

5. Pack light, but pack right.

Pack ear plugs —— you’ll want to sleep at some
point, and between noisy neighbors and blaring
music, peace and quiet will be nonexistent at
any time of the day or night.

Bring a spare change of clothes for each day.
If it’s the thick of summer, bring two shirts for
each day so you’ll have a clean one for evening
activities. Wear closed-toe shoes. Bring a ban—
dana to shield your mouth or use as a sweatband
— large moving crowds kick up dry dirt into
dust that can be inhaled — and don’t forget
sunscreen and sunglasses. ‘  

Also, make sure to read the festival rules
about items permitted inside.-Most do not allow
weapons, glass, ﬁreworks, etc., and cars are al-

reminiscent of Michael Jackson’s timeless
“Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” is a true
standout. Proving that he’s still able to get an
audience to its feet, Timberlake commands
listeners to “Come on, shake like you know
you got something to prove.”

The excitement of the track gradually
fades out before Timberlake introduces
“Mirrors,” the bombastic penultimate track.
Sounding like a modern—day sequel to “Cry
Me a River,” Timberlake realizes that his true
love has always been close by (“You were right
here all along/ It’s like you’re my mirror”).

The album ends with “Blue Ocean Floor,” a
gorgeous ballad that ﬁnds Timberlake singing
to his love from deep under the sea. The song
features stylish aquatic sounds and a clas-
sic violin solo before arriving at the album’s
conclusion.

The 20/20 Eagberience will certainly serve
as one of 2013’s most interesting pop albums.
Timberlake tasked himself with creating a
sound that comes off as both throwback and
forward—thinking, an imposing feat at which
he has succeeded.

And it appears that he is just getting
started. Timberlake conﬁrmed at his album
release party that a part two to The 20/20
Experieizre will follow later this year, though
he declined to provide a speciﬁc release date.
Until then, get lost in Timberlake’s latest gift
to the pop industry, preferably in a Tom Ford
suit and tie. I

most always checked upon entry. Most festivals
give recommendations of items to bring, as well.

6. Make shade.

A polyester tent will be unbearable to_ sit in
during the day, as no heat will be able to escape,
so be sure to have a source of shade that lets
the breeze come through,_]ust be sure to set up
something simple so you and your neighbors
don’t have another obstacle to work around.

7. Stay fresh.

Between the hot sun, everyone else’s body
heat and sweat, the close quarters and the danc-
ing, there is no way you won’t smell. Festival
showers are limited, which means long lines,
and they may cost money to use.

Skip the shower and purchase a solar shower
— a black bag that holds cold water and uses
the sun to heat it—- or bringbabywipes to wipe
skin clean. And for the love of God, spend the
extra dollar on clinical-strength deodorant.

8.‘Be cooler conscious.

The cooler is a camper’s fridge. Freeze water
bottles and use them instead of ice for the drive.
They thaw more slowly than ice, and there will
be no shortage of cold water.

Pack alcohol at the bottom of the cooler —
non-alcoholic drinks should be readily available
on top — and food should come in airtight
containers to keep it from getting soggy. '

Upon arrival, put the cooler in the shade to
prevent the ice from melting, and remember
to buy ice frequently to keep food from spoil-
ing. Bring garbage bags and disposable plates,

sporks, knives and cups, too.

9. Know the signs of an emergency.

An inability to focus, white or blue lips, cold
or clammy skin and seizures are all signs of
dehydration, the most common sun—re1ated
emergency. You know your friends best, and
you know when they’re not alright.

Most festivals do not have repercussions
for assisting friends that need medical atten-
tion because of drug or alcohol abuse, as the
event organizers would rather have you there to
explain the situation and get your friend better
as soon as possible. The best way to be sure is to
check festival websites for clariﬁcation.

Little hiccups can ruin a festival experience.
You’ll thank yourself for being prepared. E

Unlike bands that bend to modernizing
trends such as Mumford and Sons or The Lum-

rable old-timey-westem feels, Phosphorescent
never jars the listener with sharp transitions
between instrumental shifts. Guitar, piano, bass, '
drums and even a ukulele blend together to
form a monochromatic patchwork quilt that
is consistently maintained on every track, and
that makes for one of the strongest aspects of
this album.

Wilps aims for national championship
as eight Panthers hea to NCAAs

   
 

-mt:

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

The Pitt wrestling team could
celeb rate the ﬁrst national cham-
pionship recorded by one of its
wrestlers since 2008 — and the
16th overall — on Saturday night.

While eight Panthers head
to the NCAA tournament in Des
Moines, Iowa, to compete for a
national championship this week-
end, 197-pound redshirt senior
Matt Wilps holds the best chance
of coming home with the top prize.

Wilps, who was ranked second
nationally for most of the season,
enters the national tournament
with the No. 3 seed. It takes ﬁve
matches to become the champion
of the 34—man ﬁeld.

Assuming no upsets occur,
Wilps will face off against several
197-pounders that he met previ-
ously throughout the season. He
can thank Pitt’s tough dual-match
schedule for that.

“We had one of the toughest
schedules in the country,” Wilps
said. “It has prepared the entire
team to step it up to the next level
this postseason.”

And conveniently for Wilps, he
feels that he wrestles better when
facing an opponent for the second

time.

“I am normally better the sec-
ond time I meet an opponent,”
Wilps said. “I intend to use some
of their secrets against them.” _

His 5-2 record against those
potential opponents bodes well,
but the two losses came against
the top two seeds — No. 1 Dustin
Kilgore of Kent State and No. 2
Quentin Wright of Penn State.
Wilps and Wright met twice this
season, with each recording one
pin.

“I have to focus on one match at
a time,” Wilps said. “I believe that
I have done the necessary prepara-
tion to defeat [Kilgore and Wright]
and everyone else in my weight
class.”

Wilps holds an added beneﬁt
of having the wrestlers in both
weight classes around his also
headed to the NCAAS —— redshirt
sophomore Max Thomusseit at
184 pounds and fellow redshirt
senior Zac Thomusseit at heavy-
weight. Practicing against the
Thomusseit brothers gives Wilps
an advantage that many of his op-
ponents won’t have.

The elder Thomusseit, ranked
at No. 9 and the only other seeded
Panther, sets his sights on reach-
ing the podium of the top eight
wrestlers and being named an All-

American.

“I want to leave college an All-
American,” Thomusseit said. “I
was close two years ago, and it still
irks me.”

The Panthers have been hold-
ing shorter practices in order to
remain fresh for the coming tour-
nament.

“Lately, practice has been short
but intense,” said 133-pound ju-
nior Shelton Mack. “We’ve just
been focusing on sharpening and
ﬁne tuning the things we’re good
at.” 7
Before this week’s shorter
practices, the Panthers trudged
through two-a-day practices dur-
ing spring break to prepare for the
tournament.

“We had two—a-days last week I

for a hard week of training,” Zac
Thomusseit said. “We are toning
it down now to just hard drilling
and gearing up for the ﬁrst round
Thursday.”

Unlike the heavyweights, Mack
faces a disadvantage -— neither
the 125-pound or 141—pound Pitt
wrestlers qualiﬁed for nationals,
meaning he won’t have any famil-
iar sparring partners close to his
weight in Iowa. But that doesn’t
mean his teammates not headed

The Pitt men’s basketball team
returns to the NCAA tournament
today in Salt Lake City, where the
No.8-seeded Panthers match up
with the West region’s No. 9 seed,
Wichita State. The‘ 1:40 p.m. con-
test on TBS is a true matchup, as
the two teams play similar styles
of basketball.

Pitt (24-8, 12-6 Big East) head
coachjamje Dixon sees the Shock-
ers (26—8, 12-6 Missouri Valley) as
a team that plays inside—out, much
in the same way that the Panthers
function on offense. Wichita State
also rebounds just as well ——' if not
better —- than the Panthers, a facet

of the game Dixon has stressed all
season long.
“The sets they’re running are

pretty similar. Coach [Gregg] Mar- ‘

shall’s run pretty much the same
things all through his career,” Dixon
said of Pitt’s round-of-64 oppo-
nents. “They’ll look to go inside.
[Carl] Ha1l’s their guy, but their big

guys can step out and shoot outside. . »

They start big, but then they tend to
play smaller as the game goes on.”

Get ready for two days of March Madness

Dustin Gabler
Sembr Suﬁ Wrz'ter

It’s the most wonderful time of the year —
the oﬂicial start of the NCAA tournament.

Though the whole tournament is one of
the top American sporting events, the ﬁrst
two days really stand out as the best. I’m not
counting and refuse to recognize the four
play—in games that occurred Tuesday and
Wednesday in Dayton, Ohio.

On Thursday and Friday, we, asfans,
have the opportunity to see 16 quality bas-
ketball games each day, starting at 12:15 p.m.
and going the whole day until after 11:30
p.m. And we actually get to see every game.

Unlike the NFL’s opening weekend, dur—
ing which you have the opportunity to see
only seven of the 16 games, for the begin‘:
ning of March Madness, CBS will broadcast
games across four of its channels simulta-
neously. In case a game runs late and keeps

- another from being aired, CBS also makes

for,

Lu.»

them available for free on its website.

As a fan, you can’t complain.

Much like the opening rounds of the Mas-
ters Tournament or Major League Baseball’s
Opening Day, the NCAA tournament occurs
mainly during the work and school day.

But the NCAA tournament is still bet-
ter than its other two weekday~afternoon

counterparts. ~

The Masters, although it is the pinnacle
of golf competition, doesn’t decide anything
in its ﬁrst two days. You can lose a golf tour-
nament on Thursday, but you sure can’t win
one. This means no weekday ending can be
found in Augusta, Ga. '

Opening Day in the MLB is just one game ‘

of a marathon 162—game season, but that
won’t stop fans from reciting the title of a
famous Alexander Pope poem from 1734:
“Hope Springs Eternal.”

As the ﬁrst tailgates begin, often. in‘

weather too cold for baseball, every fan
holds the hope that this will be their team’s
year. Outside of a few large-market teams,
it’s very unlikely that their wishes will be-
come reality.

The NCAA tournament creates that same
feeling in the hearts of many basketball

0 fans, especially those at tiny colleges. Sure,

some of the games turn into blowouts as
overmatched teams from mid—major con-
ferences match up with the titans of college
basketball.

But that doesn’t stop every underdog.
Last year, two No. 15 seeds ruined brackets
all over the country and advanced past the
ﬁrst day. '

After star player Rodney McCauley and
Norfolk State knocked oﬁ'No. 2~seeded Mis-

souri last year, McCauley told the media
that he knew his team could win that game.

“Coming into the game, I believed it,” he
said. “I believed it from the jump. Honest
to God’s truth.”

When you combine a huge underdog that
was good enough to win its conference with
higher seeds looking ahead to the battles
that lie in the Sweet 16 and beyond, you get
the perfect recipe for an upset.

Unlike an upset on Opening Day, this
upset actually means something to the small

schools. While, historically, the lowest seed '
-to win the whole tournament was a No. 8,

a win in the round of 64 might as well be a
national championship to the Norfolk States
of the world.

The NCAA tournament takes the best
of both the Masters and Opening Day. Like
the Masters, the 68—team bracket is the
pinnacle of its sport, and like Opening Day,
it gives everyone hope that this could be
their chance. »

With all the entertainment that the tour-
nament provides, I’m not sure why Thursday
and, Friday aren’t just national holidays.

Many of the employees who go to work
and the students who go to class will just
be watching the games on their laptops,
anyway. I V

to nationals aren’t challenging him be-
fore then.

He even has three—time NCAA qualiﬁed
and current redshirt Anthony Zanetta in
the 125—pound weight class helping him
prepare for NCAAs.

“Zanetta and [125-pounder] Derrick
Nelson have been doing a great job doing
everything they can to help get‘ me ready,”
Mack said.

As a team, Pitt wants a top-10 ﬁnish
at nationals —— something the program
hasn’t achieved since ﬁnishing eighth in
1970.

Also representing Pitt at the NCAA
wrestling championships will be freshman
Ronnie Garbjinsky at 149 pounds, senior
Donnie Tasser at 157 pounds, sophomore
Tyler Wilps at 165 pounds and freshman
Nick Bonaccorsi at 174 pounds.

The group of eight wrestlers attend-
ing the national tournament ties Pitt with
Central Michigan for ninth-most wres-
tlers, behind just eight schools sending
nine or 10 team members to compete at
the NCAAs.

With so many wrestlers making the
trip to Iowa, the Panthers feel they have a
legitimate shot at that top-10 ﬁnish. And
Pitt won’t be happy without it.

“We want to ﬁnish in the top 10 as a
team,” Zac Thomusseit said. “If we don’t
get that, I think we are underachieving.”

Taylor said.

Taylor ﬁgures to play a large role in estab-
lishing Pitt’s presence on the inside, the area
in which the Shockers prefer to operate and
ﬁnd success on offense. Alongside freshman
center Steven Adams and redshirt junior for-
ward Talib Zanna, Pittshould still maintain a
size advantage over the aggressive Shockers
frontcourt.

“We gotta take it one game at a time and
one possession at a time,” Taylor said. “Their
four-man and ﬁve—man like to be aggressive
and really get after the ball.”

One part of the Shockers’ attack features
the use of a “stretch-four,” a smaller power for-
ward role parallel to the one Dixon uses with
junior forward ].J. Moore off the bench. For
Wichita State, that role is most often played
by leading scorer Cleanthony Early, who posts
