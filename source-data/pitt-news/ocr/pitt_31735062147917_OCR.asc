Costumes, Sceneries and Pro-

“Bound in Morocco,” a comedy

1 with music in two volumes was pre-

sented to the University. students,
Alumni and many ,others at perform-
ances in the Schenley Theater last
Thursday, Friday and Satu!‘ y
nights. Bill Gregory and Louis
Itscoitz, co-authors of the comedy unit.
ravelled a plot whichlboth entertained
and pleased as well as it held the
amusement seekers from the begin-
ning to the close of the play.

Aubrey Schoﬁeld’s portrayal of
Captain Paul Maxwell, the hero, was
well received. Schoﬁelds mannerisms
and his singing again give him a

Cap and Gown productions. As M.
Gaston Moteur, a French cinema
agent, Eddie Georgels characteriza-
tion was indicative of a Frenchman's
zeal and efferveseence in his attempts:
to woo Janet Whitney, the American
girl, played by Howard Zei-gler.‘
West’s and Kle.-in’s Menthol and
Phenol parts, the dark deserters from
the A. E. F., brought many a laugh
from the audience with their clatter.
L. E. Hilleary’s terpischorian offer-
ing, an Oriental dance, was well exe-
cuted. Hantgartner ﬁlled the role as
the rich father. W. H. Ruppel gave
an excellent‘ presentation of a typical
social worker, Eunhamia Flint.

The music was not so tuneful as it
has been in former years. However,
several selections stood out. The
“I’m not in love with you” song, -by
Eddie Specter, seemed the most
catchy and taking. It was easily the
hit of the show. Other songs which
made favorable impressions were
“Under the Moon,”'by George Curry,
and “Queen of the Silver‘ Screen,”
also by Specter. “Alma Mater,” writ-
ten by G. M. Baird, i09, director of
“Mound in Morocco,” closed the musi-
cal comedy. Chorus work, which
helped many Cap and Gown shows in
the past to attain success was con-
spicuous -by its absence.

Director G. M. P. Baird, Hans Mul-
ler, who made all the costumes, and
Professor Karl Heinrich, in charge of
the coreography, are to be congratu-

Efforts Being Made to Organ-
ize Battery Composed En-
l tirely of Pitt Men

I

 

Battery C, of the 176th Regiment
of Field Artillery, Pennsylvania Na-
tional Guard, whose headquarters
and armory is directly across the

‘Mellon Institute, Bayard and Thack-
eray Streets,‘ Oakland, is now «being
organized. An effort is ‘being made
to make this battery, the last one
in the regiment ‘lacking recognition
by the Federal Government, a strict-
ly Pitt organization, officered by Pitt
alumni or students, with the entire
enlisted personnel Pitt undergrad-
uates.

The 176th Field Artillery is the
only Pennsylvania Guard Regiment
whose members are recruited from
the vicinity of one city. It consists
of six -ﬁring batteries, -three combat
traihs, one service and one headquar-
ters battery and a medical detach-
ment, and forms a part of the Third
Corps troops.

Tht advantages of having a Pitt
battery in this, ,_“Pittsburgh’-s Own”
regiment of heavy artillery are" many
--to the student, to the University
and to the City of Pittsburgh. A
battery of “Pitt” boys would make
a real battery, one that any com-
mander would be proud of. The di-
rect advantages to the individual
student are:

1. He will receive drill and camp
Pay-
2. R. O. T. C. students who join

the National Guard will naturally re-
ceive more consideration upon grad-
uation when “Reserve officers” com-
missions are given by the United
States Army.

3. The ﬁfteen day camp each sum-
mer in the Pocano Mountains will be
a great beneﬁt to every student.

.4. ‘The announced policy of the
regimental commander is that from
now on, all second ligutenants must
come from the ranks. All non-com-
missioned officers who qualify and
attend the officers’ training school,
receive upon graduation, a commas-
sion as second lieutenant and when
vacancies occur, are assigned to a
battery, ..

5. Athletics, such as baseball,
football, basketbalhboxing, etc., are
encouraged in this regiment. Three

clubs are maintained in the Armory

cents next week to the support of as 
Pitt man on the faculty of the Canton ‘ ‘
Christian College at Canton, China, 
for the, ensuing year, ascording to .. , 
plans announced by the committee ’
working on the matter with Dean A.
B. Wright.

This will be the annual drive to
continue Pitt’s participation as a .
member of the group of American in-
stitutions that have been largely sup-
porting this educational, work in;
China for a number of years. The
plan as finally adopted at a meeting
of the general committee last Friday‘
in the Heinz House, calls for talks by
students in the class rooms on Mon- A
day and Tuesday of neict week, an-
nouncement in Assembly on Wednes-A
day, and collection in the class rooms
on Thursday and Friday. Pitt aims
to raise at least $1,500 on these two I
days. A

The student solicitors who will visit
the class rooms on these two days will
be provided with “shares” of stock. “
Each student will be asked to sub- T
scribe to at least one -share, more if .
‘he cares to and can. Shares will cost“ -
50 cents each. In addition to the
shares, contributors will be given but-
tons which will indicate that they
have “come across” and should not
be solicited again on the campus.

The man selected to represent Pitt
on the teaching staﬂ’ of Canton Chris-
tian College next year, and for whose
support this drive will be made, is
Henry Frank, 9. Senior in the De-.
partment of Chemistry. Mr. Frank
will receive his degree in June, sail-A
ing in September for Canton. He will a
be ,’ in charge of the Department of
Physics. Mr. Frank succeed-s JLF

Medical School to complete his course
here. ‘

The work which the University'~isC,
doing in helping to maintain Canton
Christian College has been described-3!
by those who have been there as one
of,,the ﬁnest services the University 1
is rendering in any ﬁeld of work.

that the students should feel it a priv-- ,
ilege to help in this work, inasmuch-
as it is the one piece of service which
the University does entirely outside.

‘"llMES” ERITIC LAUIIS
.lllHNSTllN’S NEW Bllllli

“The New York Evening Times”
Magazine Section, of March 26, has

the following to say regarding Wil-

liam Johnston's new book “The Trage-
«dly at The Beach Club”. I

“This stiory will win an audience
with those who do not like the ordi-
nary run of murder novels, because
it is told in a simple manner, though
the mystery grips the reader through-
out. There is a detective in the
std'ry, of course, but the reader sees
the evidence gathered and the solu-
tion made from the point of view of
Bill Tilt, the murdered man's execu-
tor and the Terrible Kit———two young
people with ordinary minds.

“Terrible Kit," with her spirit writ-
ings and her Oiuija board‘ and their mys-
terious messages, and her insatiable
curiosity and interest in the murder.
provesva ﬁne companion for Bill. To-
gether, during the absences of the
private detective Dick Devan, they
discover many points which forward
the solution of the case; in fact, K‘
practically solves the murder‘ wit
her quick wit and woman's intuition.

“Who killed Dr. Rhodes? is the
question. ‘He was a great favorite at
the colony. Every one admired him.
He was“a. specialist who seemed to
have no enemies, who had: many
friends, and who was the last one
those who knew him would think of
being murdered. Yet he is found
murdered at the clubho-use.

“The will of the doctor brings an-
other complication into the book.

Why should the doctor leave all his ,

wealth to the daughter of a dear
friend———-and who is the wife who is
mentioned in the will? For the doc-
tor had always been thought a bache-
lor. ’

“Two not over-sentimental love sto-
ries are woven intothe mystery, and
have a greatdeal of bearing bu the
murder.

“ ‘The square husky voice’--the
voice of murder——is not recognized
until seven pages before the ‘mile,’
and the reader who is an adept at
solving murder stories will find it
diﬁcult to pick the guilty person be-
fore the author revebls that person's
name.”

Mr. Johnston, who is an 1891- man,
a well known New York newspaper
man and author. His publishers are
Little, Brown & Company.

“Shifters”

It costs money to shift, when we locate a dentist he stays put.

There is something more serious than findlngyou a vacant room
for the sake of writing up an equipment order.

We want you to make good.

That's why we go to considerable

extra trouble to see that you won't shift.

Fraternities play su ‘h an important part in the

life of Pitt infthe absence of dormitories that the history of their growth, no doubt, will be interesting not only

to fraternity men, but to the University body as a whole.
Civil War, several of the well known national fraternities, including’ Phi Gamma Delta, and, we think, Delta Tau‘
The war broke up these organizations, and nothing like them existed until the professional

Delta, having groups.

Fraternities existed at Pitt back at the time of the

groups were organized, and in the College and Engineering schools at least one local organization existed around
1898. We printed an article regarding this group some time ago, it being the Sigma Alpha Fraternity.

KNOWN AS DELTA KAPPA

This organization also went out of existence after a couple of years, and the ﬁrst organization in the under-

graduate schools to be formed after that time in the undergraduate ‘schools was what is now Sigma Chi.

The

group was then known as Delta Kappa and we print above the ﬁrst picture taken of them. It was founded Octo-

ber 20, 1902, the picture being taken in 1903 so far as We can learn.

The fraternity occupied several fooms in a

house on the North Side near the old W. U. P. campus on Perrysville Avenue, and the boys ate lunch together
at noon. No other meals were served and there were no sleeping accommodations.

The next fraternity to be organized was Delta Tau Delta, then known as Alpha Alpha.
It Came into existence Shortly after Delta "Kappa, the organization date being October

nickname was “Alfalfas.”

fraternities were the only ones in existence until the University moved to the new site, the Schenlcy Farms, when
other‘ organizations sprung up, the first being S. A. E. Then came Phi Delta Theta and so on. The last two
named started as locals and were granted chapters later in the national organization. ’

“MANLEY COMMITTEE”

 

“Get ﬁve votes for Manley” is the
slogan of the committee of Pitt alum-
ni and students, which is working
for the nomination of Louis K. Man-
ley, popular political science teach-.
er, who is a candidate for the Con-
gressional nominations _in. the Thir-
ty-ﬁfth District. ‘The enthusiasm
with which his announcement was
greeted by the 12.00 or more Pitt-
ites living in the East End and South
Side wards, compobing the district,
indicates that he will have practically
unanimous support from followers of
the Panther in his distric.t, while
scores of Pitt people living outside
its boundaries have volunteered to
help and are -boosting Manley to their
friends who are in a position to vote
for him.

J. Garﬁeld Houston, '03, is ‘chair-
man -of an alumni committee formed
to back Manley, which during the
week will get in touch with every
Pittite in the district by letter. Of
this committee, half a dozen mem-
bers are also active in Manley’s gen-
eral committee. Minnie Z. Buckley,
;,15, is secretary of the Pitt group,
which also includes L. J. Aifelder, Ar-
thur L. Arnold, Anne Bowes, Louis
Broido, Scott M. Conway, Robert G.
Eckhardt, Katherine Foulke, Robert
E. Grove, Paul L. II-Iay, John W. Hal-
Iock, James Irvine, C. A. F. James,
Mrs. George E. Jones, Carlton G‘.
Ketchum, Dr. J . A. Koch, ‘Paul Kress,
Dorothy Ludebuehl, Ben J. Lubic,
Harold Lucas, Norman MacLeod,
Theodore Mandeville, David K. Mc-
Donald, John T. Murray, Mrs_ Hazd
Keifer W. Peden, Earle‘ W. Reed,
Charles W. Ridinger, Mrs. J . R. Ros-
enfeld, Edward H. Schietinger, C. G.
L. Schramm, Alexander Silverman,
Dr. H. A.’ Shaw, Charles D. Wettach
and Charles L. Wooldridge.

The students, led of course by those
who know Manley as teacher’ and
friend, are equally ‘active and en-
thusiastic and many of them are par-
ticipating in various ways in the
campaign. Some of them are or-
ganizing a house—to-house campaign
in their wards, hoping to reach every
voter before pri-mary day, May 16,
with the Manley message. A call
will be issued this week for volunteer
workers, and it is expected that an
ample number of the Pittites in the
district will offer their services as
personal workers, each with the task
of converting his immediate neigh-
borhood to the Manley cause. .
 Reports from the Manley head-
quarters during the past week have
been optimistic. Already strong in
the East End section of the district,
Manley is making important gains in
the -South Side, and it is expected
that by the end of the -week he will
be in splendid position in that part
of the district. 8

With the beginning of next week, the Canton Christian College
campaign for funds will be under way. The support of each student
is needed to “put across” this drive, a yearly feature on the campus.
Comparison of Pitt ’s record in maintaininguthis institution with that

of other colleges will plainly show

that we have lagged behind. Penn’

State with a smaller student body" has contributed more than Pitt.
Likewise the University of Pennsylvania has contributed more pro-

portionately. I
This weak showing of Pitt is

probably due to the fact that stu-

dents have never realized the true signiﬁcance of such a campaign.

personally how this institution is lending its support.

The campaign quota, set at a

minimum of $1,500, can be raised

through contributions of not less than ﬁfty cents from each student.
Can nqt every student be counted upon to give his share——-and in
some cases more than his share-—in order to make this worthy cam-

In answer to the student in the

is much worse than the aforesaid

T_his habit together with leaving
cigarette ashes and dirty dishes lit-
tered over the tables makes the cafe-

eat in. The management of the cafe-
teria serves the best food obtainable
and gives portions enough to ﬁll the

PITT PLAYERS TO
sue:-: NEW PLAYS

Pitt Players presented Shaw's
“Arms and the Man” last Friday even-
ing in the Junior High School audi-
torium at McKeesport. The play was
staged under the management of the
Women’s College Club. Irene Garri-
son Cramblet, ’17, a former Pitt Play-

er, and Dorothy Hodgsen Dodds, ‘19.

were in charge of arrangements.

“Arms and the Man” is well known
as a clever satirical comedy. It por-
trays the typical conquering hero and
his relation to society as contrasted
with the unassuming man. The ever
present love theme ends in the inevit-
able question: “How much is the
prospective bridegroom worth?” The
role of Louka, the maid, was excep-
tionally well portrayed by Hebe H.
Dreyfoos and the part of Raina. was
cleverly enacted by Phyllis Newlands.
Oiher members of the cast were as
follows: Charlotte Ball, Alfred R.
Waters, John Walker, J. 1. Martin,
Walter T. Ackley and George B. Mc-
Candless. '

The casts for the plays for children
to be given May 12 and 13 have been
posted. Wilbert S. Ray has been cast
in the leading juvenile role.

A matinee performance of Synge’s
“Riders To the Sea,” “Marriages Are
Made In Heaven and Elsewhere” and
“These Wild Young Things” is plan-
ned for May 19 and 20 in the'Heinz
House. Students are invited to at-
tend this performance.

The brief playlet, “Love the Lock-
smith,” by Prof. Thomas Kennedy of

the Carnegie Institute of Technology-,,

which was presented in conjunction
with the W. S. G. A. circus, will be
repeated this afternoon as a feature
of the Theta Alpha Phi and Delta
Sigma Phi reception in honor of the
speakers of the Civic Oratorical
League.

On May 11 the Pitt Players will
present “Pygmalion and Galatea,” by
W. S. Gilbert. The cast is as follows:
Pygmalion, Lytton Scholp; Leucippe,
John Truxall; Chrysos, Robert Hep-
penstall; Agesimos, Alfred Waters;
Minos, John Johnston; Galatea, Doro-
thy Stewart; Cynisca, Marion Smith;

MINES

 

-Students in the Senior and Junior
Classes, specializing in Mining, took
a trip on April 16 to visit the mines
of the Pittsburgh Limestone Com-
pany and the Winﬁeld Sand Com-
pany at West Winﬁeld,‘But1er Coun-
ty, Pa. ‘The first company mines
limestone, the second, sandstone.
Among the interesting features at
the Pittsburgh Limestone Com-
pany’s Mines is a large section of
worked-out area which has been leas-
ed to a company of Frenchmen, who
use it for the purpose of raising
mushrooms. This company produces
a very largepercentage of the mush-
rooms "sold in this country.

On Thursday, A-pril 27, a lecture

of Chicago, representative of the
Goodman Manufacturing Company.
His subject was “Applications of
Electricity to Mining.”

Take It From The Air

  

OT only music, but news, speeches, .mes- .
sages of every sort, are today being picked
out of the air. '

f‘How has this come about?” we ask}.

The new impetus given to radio development
may be deﬁnitely associated with the, develop-
ment of the high power vacuum tube, for" that
made broadcasting possible. And the power
tube’ originated from a piece of purely theoreti-~
cal research, which had no connection with-radio.

When a scientist in the Regarch Laboratories
of the General Electric Company found that
electric current could be made to pass through
the highest possible vacuum and could be varied
according to ﬁxed laws, he established the pr1n- -.. _.
ciple of the power tube and laid the foundation   fl‘,
for the “tron” group of devices. -

1 These devices magnify the tiny telephone ,
currents produced by the V0iC€ and Supply
them to the antenna, which broadcasts" the
messages. At the receiving end, ‘smaller
“trons”, in turn, magnify the otherwise im-
perceptible messages coming to them from the-
receiving antenna.

 

Great accomplishments are not picked out T
of the air. Generally, as in this case, they grow  
from one man’s insatiable desire to ﬁnd out ’

TUNIST CLUB IS
ORGANIZED HERE

The formal organization meeting
of the Tunists Club of the University
was held in the William Penn Hotel
last Saturday evening, April 22. Dr.
E. K‘. Strong, Junior, of the Carnegie

own support while taking a course
at the University. It is formed for
the express purpose of helping the
mem*bers to select their life work or
at least to understand beforehand the
difficulties and peculiarities they are
to expect when they undertake a part
in the business world.

for non-commissioned officers and
one for commissioned officers.

The requirements for enlistment
in the Pitt battery or Battery C, as
it is officially designated are that
each man must be a Pitt s-tudent, at
least eighteen years old, and able to
pass the physical examination.

A ﬁring battery of heavy .ar.til-
lery has a peace strength of four
commissioned officers and a mini-
mum of sixty-ﬁve enlisted men. They
are seven sergeants,—-one ﬁrst, one
instrument, one signal, three chiefs
of sections who have direct charge
of the guns, and, one mess and sup-
ply sergeant; seven corp«ora1s,—--one
battery clerk, one instrument, one
scout, one signal an_d «three «gunners
make up the minimum lis-t of cor-
porals. Eight privates are assigned
as chauffeurs and tractor drivers. The
balance of the enlisted pensonnal are
made up of cannoneers, telephone
men “and telephone guards. Special
instruction is given in motor me-
chanics, instrument work, limbering
and unlimbering the big guns, tele-
phone and radio works, pistol drill
and foot drill. The men of this bat-
tery will be required to drill every
Tuesday evening at the Armory, from
8:00 to 9'30 A. M., one day’s work
being received for each ordered drill.

Once each year, »the entire regi-
ment goes to camp ﬂor target prac-

tice, all expenses being paid by the‘

Government in addition to camp pay.
July 8th to 23rd, inclusive. has been
set at the date of the coming camp,
which will be held at Tobyhanna, Pa.
Tobyhanna lies in the Pecan-o" Moun-
tains, thirty miles southeast of
Scranton, Pa., on the main line of
the Lackawann-a Railroad. Here the
Government owns about 150,000 acres
of land which_ is used for a target
range. The town of T-obyhanna, a
summer resort, having several hotels,
is only ten minutes’ walk from camp.
Pocano, a much larger resort is With-

in ﬁfteen minutes’ driving distance

of the camp. The entire course of
instruction at -the summer camp i-s
under the direct supervision of Re-
gular Army officers assigned for the
purpose. I

The history of this regiment dates
back to 1831 when it wag organized
as the Duquesne Greys, serving with
lfonor through the Mexican and Civil
wars. About 1-878, it was changed to
the 18th Regiment and served dur-
ing the Spanish-American War under
that designation. The record of this
organization during the World War
in France is an enviable one, serving
as the 111th Infantry and participat-
ing in practically all the major en-
gagements. April 1, 1921, this regi-
ment was officially changed from In-
fantry to Artillery and designated
as the 176th Field Artj_ille_ry, being
a part of the Third Corps troops.

The following officers "of this regi-
menlt are University of Pittsburgh
men: Major, T. H. -Snowhite; Cap-
tains, Roy E. ‘Sleppy, Wm. E, Kra-
mer, Herbert Sullivan, Roy H. Uh1-
Inger, Sr., Dan T. R. Dickson, and
Karl H. Shriver" and Lieutenants, H.
S. Douglass, Geo. ‘F. Hosack, Chas.
W. Scott, K. F. Humphries, Park R.
MoCandless and Dan I. Jamison, Jr.

The commander of the regiment,
Colonel Won. R. Dunlap has been
connected with the National ‘Guard
for many years, serving on the Mexi-
can Border and through the entire
period of the World War. He en-
listed as ‘a private in Company G,
18th Regiment. A't+ the outbreakof
the World War, he was a captain of
a company, receiving his majority
shortly afterwards a-t Camp Hancock.
While in France, he was promoted to
Lieurt. Colonel and then to Colonel,
and given command of the 109th In-
fantry. Colonel Dunlap lives in
Knoxville, is a member of the coun-
cil, has served in the Pennsylvania
State Legislature and is now a can-
didate for the United States Con-
grass.

The commander of the proposed
“Pitt” battery is‘. Captain K. H.
Shriver, a mgmber of the 1908 en-
gineering class. At rtheoutbreak of
the War, he applied for a commission
in the Engineers as ﬁrst lieutenant,
and was assigned to special duty.
Captain Shriver received a lieuten-
ant’s commission in the 176th Field
Artillery, May 1921 and was assigned
to staff duty. January 1922, he-was
assigned to Battery A, as executive
officer, remaining with that Battery
until recently when he was promoted
and given command of Battery C, the
“Pitt” Battery. He has followed en-
gineering continuously since grad-
ation, having specialized in heavy
construction work. At the present
time he is United States Assistant
Engineer, in charge of he construc-
tion of the new Allegheny River
locks and dams and the proposed new
repair plant at Davislsland Dam.

Any bona ﬁde student or graduate
of the University of Pittsburgh is
eligible to become a member of this
organization. All men who are in-
terested should personally see Cap-
tain Shriver at the Armory any eve-
ning during the week of May 1 to
6 or at his office, 1603 Keenan Build-
ing any day during the week. Any
officer, however, in the 176th F. A.
will furnish information to prospec-
tive recruits and if desired, will en-
list them.

‘NOT A STROKE DOES FAIR
GLORIA SWAN SON SWIM

 

Star of “Beyond the Rocks” Risks
Life Bravely During Filming
- of Picture **

Week of May 8th

Gloria Swanson, famous ﬁlm star
can’t swim a stroke!

That didn’t deter her, however,
when it became necessary for scenes
in “Beyond the Rocks” her latest
starring vehicle which will be shown
all next week at the Olympic Theater
Fifth avenue,‘ downtown, from plung-
ing into the ocean near Catalina Isl-
and, out of her own boat and then
keeping up by the best of her ability
until rescued by Rudolph Valentino,
who plays the leading man role.

I never knew it was so hard to.
deliberately fall out of a boat into
into the water until I tried ,to do
it in a natural way, observed the star,
after the perilous scenes had been
secured- “One of my oars accidently
slipped. out of the oar-lock, and that
gave me the idea, by pulling hard on
one car and then letting it slip out,
and throwing myself to one side,'I
would seem. naturally to fall right
ever the side of the tipping ‘boat into
the water.

The camera started and gathering
my courage, I splashed over the side
into the water. When I_ got my
breath I screamed for the rescue sig-

me.
struggles, but ﬁnally I got my senses
together and calmed down a little,
then they pulled us into a boat. We
were in the water about twenty min-
utes and after the scenes, I was sick
for a little while, "due to having swal-
lowed some of the salt water.

Although Gloria Swanson, was
formerly hailed as a Mack Sennet
bathing girl, she had never learned
to swim.

“Beyond the Rocks” is a picture
of lavish scintillating romance en-
compassing England, France and
Italy, it is highly realistic and faith-
ful adaption of Elinor Glyn’s famous
novel of the same name. ‘

Three major factors should
be considered in the selec-
tion of your life work J ‘

1. Servlce—-contributing to the fund of human happiness. Sooner or
later, in all lives, comes the inevitable conclusion that work, lack- —
ing the element of altruism, leaves a void, which no measure of
material success can ﬁll.

Unlimlted opportunity for exercise, of ability. No career may
hope for its fullest development when its growth is circumscribed
‘by obstacles over which personal ability has no control. We refer
to salaried positions, most of which range within well defined
limits, both as regards the display of ability, and remuneration.

Unlimited opportunity to earn. This is obvious and needs no am-
pliﬁcation. '

The Institution of Life Insurance meets these c
three requirements.

Its sale is attracting the best brains of the country.

The Edward A. Woods Company, the largest Life Insurance .
Agency in the world, at your request will submit information which
may be helpful in your decision about a career. ‘

Summer Work for Students
_ PLEASANT WORK--BIG PAY--EXTRA AWARDS

What are you going to do this Summer, Men? Will you take a

job that will tie you down, keep you indoors the whole ummer long.

‘ pay you $15 or $25 a week, and leave you feeling like the very old
dickens when College opens next Fall?

Or have you in mind landing something that will keep you out of

doors, enable you to travel, pay you $50 each week for expenses, give

you a good sum of money to defray next year’s expenses, and at the

end of the Summer leave you with the feeling that you have had a
real vacation? '

, Every student desiring employment for this Summer will do well
to look into the opportunities which we are in a- position to offer. A
letter of inquiry will bring you full details.

Union High, 10-2

The Freshman baseball team de-
feated the crack Union High team at
Turtle Creek by the score of 10-2 last.
Tuesday. The Freshies put up an

' unbeatazble game of ball and held
: their weaker opponents completely at
i their mercy at all times’. The -game
' was featured by one unfortunate in-

cident, however, which somewhat

" dampened the ardor of the Panther-

lings. This was the injury of one

A of their teammates, Louder, who in-

jured his ankle so badly that he will

A, be unable to participate in the games ’ i

for the next three weeks at least,
The Fresh played a “bang-up”

-game during every one of the seven
“frames of the contest. Harvey was
J?‘-the batting star for the Pantherlings,
‘pa-s he got a three-bagger and two
“ doubles.

Unfortunately the umpire
decided him out on his triple, For
the Union High team Botti, Ament.
and Cqtazzo deserve special men-
tion as they secured six o-ut of -the
seven hits with which their team was
credited. Bruder, Gwosden, and
Gates, who took Louder’s place in the
third when he was hurt all deserve

credit for their excellent perform-
ance. A curious coincidence was the
fact that each of the three pitchers
struck out ﬁve men. The whole game

.was played during an intense drizzle

which rendered the ﬁeld in anything
but pleasant light to‘ spectators and
players alike. -

The Fresh were scheduled to play
the South Hills team on last Thurs-
day but the game was cancelled.
Their schedule for this week includes:
Tuesday, Aspimwall High School, at
Aspinwal-1, and Thursday, Braddock
High at Trees ‘Stadium.
