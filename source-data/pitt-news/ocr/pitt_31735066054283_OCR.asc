Pitt Professor Mark
Ginsburg was one of the
speakers at the event. He
talked about how the
government has just
spent over $44 million
($1 million for each rr1is—

point.”

“We can’t let them
speak in our name, and
we have to stop them
from future actions,” Ginsburg said in
his speech. “If we are going to have a
government, it has to be for the peo-

Officially effective at 5 p.m.,
Tuesday, Sept. 3, the newest Pitt ID
was finally tested campus—wide. It’s
the PittCard.

How is it going?

Frustration seems to be the key
word used by students, staff, and fac-
ulty. The road to the PittCard hasbeen
a little rocky.

What had been anticipated by
desk attendants, those in food service,
and other employees of the University
since mid-summer, has finally become
.a full—ﬂedged reality that doesn’t quite
have the bugs worked out yet.

“Are there going to be hiccups? .

Absolutely,” said John Devitto, asso-
ciate vice chancellor of business.
Devitto acknowledged that change is
difficult but said that the PittCard is a
positive thing for the University. He
said that it keeps Pitt competitive with
other universities, and it emphasizes
customer service. '

The major “hiccup”_ seems to be
the problem with unsuccessful swip-
ing due either to improper magnetiza-
tion or mistreatment of the card.

The office, located on

with several speakers, includ-

who’s been there 30 years and
is still trying to get_ another
job,” said Joe Preston, state
representative from East
Liberty, referring to Bob Dole
in his speech at the opening of
the headquarters.

Many different politi-
cians spoke during the event,
and the central theme was par-

_ticipation, both in the cam-
paign and in voting.

Murphy said. “So, if you
believe in opportunities for

great deal of job growth, and if

Murphy was not the
only speaker to press for
increased student involvement.

Students in the residence halls
complain of the slower access to their
buildings. Now instead of merely
ﬂashing their IDs to the desk atten-
dant, residents must swipe their card
through the card reader and wait for
verification. Valid IDs which register
in error are slowing down the process.

Not all students have been issued
the new PittCard. Staff, students, and

faculty members are anticipating,
more chaos once all the upperclass-

men hold the PittCard. The ID Center
will hold a conversion process for

upperclassmen which will begin on ‘

Sept. 23.

“The PittCard is not real efficient
when it gets busy, but so far it’s OK,”
said Mary Watson, a desk attendant at
Holland Hall. A

According to many desk atten-
dants, the minor glitches that occur
with the PittCard will soon be reme-
died. “Once people learn how to use
it, it’ll get better,” said Watson. She
said that the PittCard is newer, faster,
and more effective than the IDs of the
past.

Turkey establishes security

Across the Nation

SURF CITY, N.C. — Residents of this
barrier island community, still reeling
from Hurricane Bertha, got their first,
stunned looks at Fran’s devastation yester-
day: 20 oceanfront houses in a row were
obliterated, and streets were covered with
so much water that ﬁsh were jumping in
them.

It was clear that Bertha had just been
a warm-up for people here. This time it
will be harder to bounce back.

Fran killed at least 22 people — 17 of
them in North Carolina — most by falling
trees, ﬂooding, and traffic accidents. And
unlike Bertha, which moved up the coast
in July, Fran plowed deep inland, knock-
ing down trees and power lines in the cap-
ital of Raleigh, N.C., and dumping 14.5
inches of rain on central and western
Virginia.

The Insurance Information Institute
estimated losses to insured private proper-
ty owners at $625 million, but the overall
total was sure to be much higher.

WASHINGTON — A small probe of
possible perjury charges against several
tobacco executives for 1994 congression-
al testimony has been expanded into a far-
reaching Justice Department investiga-
tion. It remains to be seen whether indus-
try officials have systematically made
false or misleading statements to
Congress and government agencies about
the addictive nature of tobacco and indus-
try practices.

Officials said that as part of the inves-
tigation, the FBI and the Justice
Department have used police tactics usu-
ally employed to break open drug rings.
These tactics are pressuring current and
former rr1id—level employees of at least
one tobacco company to turn over infor-
mation about their corporate bosses. The

Around the World

BAGHDAD, Iraq — Iraq said yesterday
that it had fired missiles at U.S. planes
policing a “no-ﬂy” zone, but rriissed. A
newspaper run by President Saddam
Hussein’s son called for a holy war against
the United States.

The United States said it could not
confirm that Iraq had shot at U.S. war-
planes. White House spokesman Barry

said, “We’ve checked pretty thoroughly
with all known parties and have nothing to
confirm this report.” The Washington Post

LONDON — Secretary of State Warren
Christopher said that the U.S. understands
Turkey’s reasons for establishing a securi-
ty zone in Iraq and has been assured it
would be temporary.

He told reporters that the Turks had
“genuine reasons to be concerned about
their border” due to cross—border attacks
by the Kurdish Workers Party. The Party
has long sought to carve an independent
state out of southeastern Turkey and oper-
ates from bases in Northern Iraq. Reuters

MOSCOW — President Boris Yeltsin’s
chief of staﬂ said yesterday that Yeltsin
may transfer his powers to Prime Minister
Viktor Chemomyrdin for a short time
while undergoing heart surgery, but this

 

ll ""7 1 V‘...

transfer will not exist for an extended peii- .5

od.

Anatoly Chubais said it would proba-
bly last “for hours, a day, two days.” He
said Yeltsin is now in a “normal working
condition,” analyzing and working on
documents.

Yeltsin armounced this week that he
will undergo heart surgery in Moscow at
the end of September. The Kremlin has
not armounced the precise nature or date
of the surgery, and one unanswered ques-
tion is whether Yeltsin faces other compli-
cations and risks. The Washington Post

SARAJEVO — Bosnia’s elections,
scheduled for Sept. 14, have become all
things to all people in this war—ravaged
land.

For some, these complicated elections
are a testimony to Western organizational
acumen. But for others, they are a lesson
in Western incompetence and naivete.
Pessirnists say they will seal the fate of the
country, splitting it into three volatile, eth-
nically homogeneous ministates.
Optimists counter that they will unite this
shattered patch of mountainous earth and
inspire hope.

Whoever is right, the elections will
mark the first time people have -voted
throughout an independent Bosnia. They
also constitute the first voting since elec-
tions in all six Yugoslav republics in 1990
helped spark the federation’s breakup and
Europe’s bloodiest conflict since World
War H. The Washington Post

spoke of this action as being one to help
the oil companies and big businesses, as
well as being an election year ploy.

“President Clinton has to protect his
lead in the polls, and this is the reason
for the series of events that have taken
place. I can’t remain silent-during this
outrage,” said Brutus during his speech.

Several other speakers took the
megaphone, including J arnila Levi from
the Western Pennsylvania Committee to
Free Mumia Abu-Jamal. Even though
her voice was giving out and she could
barely speak, she made her point'— she
disagrees with the military action and
condemns further actions.

“This is about keeping all the

'l'I-IE PITT NEWS

wealth in the United States and demo-
nizing other world leaders to build sup-
port,” Levi said. “This proves that there
is no difference between the Democrats
and the Republicans.”

Sandy Sherman, from the
Pittsburgh Cuban Coalition, talked
about how she felt thatthis has been a
long—standing effort by the CIA to
unseat Hussein. She felt that this was
just the culmination of their efforts.

“We believe in the sovereign right
of nations to determine their own des-
tiny —— free from the inﬂuence of the
United States,” Sherman said during her
speech.

Sherman said that the Kurds have

 

been protecting themselves and that
they should be allowed to do so on their
own.

After the speeches, Ginsburg spoke
of why he was involved. “I’m here
because I’m angered by what is being
done in my name ———in all of our
names.”

Ginsburg said that the United States
is going against what the United Nations
had requested and does not even have
the support of the countries that the U.S.
is trying to protect.

“We unilaterally and without the
permission of the United Nations rede-
fined their imposed no—ﬂy zone,”
Ginsburg said. “I am outraged that with

missiles in such a frivolous way. Now

somebody is going to have to pay to 7

He said that this money could have 3
been used in much better ways, citing ?
education or research as examples. * P

“If they really were committed to
peace, "this wouldn’t have happened. 1
They would have just imposed more ‘
sanctions. This is a much bigger issue. i
It’s about oil and territory and who con-
trols it,” said Ginsburg.

The demonstrators vowed to keep
protesting as long as they feel there are
injustices.

New IDs a waste of

time and money

Just last year, we were forced to get new IDs. These IDs
were heralded as the biggest thing since sliced bread We were
told that it would vastly improve our student life. One could not
use his or her meal plan with out this new ID. So, we spent our
time standing in line to get them. Now, what was heralded as so
great an improvement is obsolete. -.

Once again, we are supposed to stand in line and put up with
the inconvenience of getting another ID. These IDs are coming
from a partnership Pitt has formed with American Express. We
would like to know what expense to the students will come from
an institute of higher leaming forging an alliance with a credit
card company. Have we come to the crossroads where those

' institutions which are supposedly above capitalistic ventures and
greed are falling prey to corporate America?

One of the functions of the new ID is that you can buy
things with it. How much are we going to be charged for this
function, and how much is the university, as well as American
Express, making from the deal? '

At the start of this year, we were faced with a 4.5 percent
tuition increase. We were told that the increase was a result of the
freeze in the amount of state funding to the University. The
University must raise tuition due to a lack in ﬁmding, but it has
the money to set up a new ID system and promote it? The new
IDs are a waste of money. They do not eliminate the need for
security personnel at the dorms. Therefore, on top of paying for
security guards, we will be paying for equipment to handle the
new IDs, such as card readers. The University must also use its
resources to promote the IDs. The recent inundation with testi-
monials to the greatness of the new IDs is not only armoying, but
the University must use money and labor resources to bombard
us with these images.

What is more eﬂicient about the new ID? Even though you
simply swipe the card through a card reader, you must wait for a
security guard to receive veriﬁcation as to who you are. Looldng
at a picture and a sticker seems more eﬁicient Guests must still

be signed in the same way, taking up the same amount of time '

and energy that the visitation system always has.

The new ID system is full of ﬂaws. By instituting the new
IDs, the University has dropped another inconvenience into the
laps of its students. The new IDs are a complete waste of time
due to the inefficiencies in the system.

I know what you’re thinking.
You are having visions of tulips,
windmills, canals, and pot. Oh, you
don’t know how wrong you are. This
is not to say thatthese stereotypical
images of the Netherlands don’t have
some truth to them, but there is one
image that is far truer to the real
Netherlands. Yes, it’s...The Bike.
Now, I’m not speaking of American-
style bikes here — no mountain bikes
or ten—speeds. It’s the old-fashioned
one-to-three speed (if that) with hand
brakes if it’s fancy and back-pedal
brakes if it’s not. This type of trans-
portation, anachronistic to American
eyes, rules in Holland. Next to every
road there is a bike path with its own
trafﬁc lights showing
red/orange/green bikes that signal the
same way regular traﬂic lights do.
Next to every car parking lot is a bike
parking lot. Next to all blue road signs
are red ones for bikes and even special
green ones for national bike routes.

Within the wide realm of bikes
that make up the Dutch landscape,
there exists a creature called the stu-
dent bike. To illustrate this bizarre
species of bike, I will refer to person-
al experience. Not even a week into
my stay in the Netherlands, I bought a
bike in a store. Had I waited even a
few days, I would have realized the
error of my ways. No self-respecting
student ever buys a bike in a store.
The primary source of bikes is the
junks (a Dutch term for shadowy

land from the seat of a bike 

but roam the streets) in the square.
Bikes there (used ones) go for one-
tenth of the price of store-bought
bikes. One of the ﬁrst phrases a for-
eigner learns is ﬁets te koop, — bike
for sale.

Of course there are several corol-
laries that go along with the rule of
buying bikes from junks. First of all,
take a test ride on the bike before you
buy it. Second, make sure your locks
cost at least double what your bike
did Also, buy the locks and either col-
ored tape or paint before acquiring
your bike. Then, once you’ve bar-
gained a pathetically low price for
your “new’ ’ bike, ride to a place where
you can paint/tape the bike so that the
previous owner won’t recognize it. It
would be unpleasant to have someone
asking for their bike back the next
day. (Although this is unusual, for
they probably bought the bike from a
junk as well.)

The only legal worry one has
during this whole affair of acquiring a
bike occurs during the buying stage. If
the police see you buying ﬁorn a junk,
they will arrest you because they ﬁg-
ure it w‘ll be more eﬁective than
anesting the junk. Bike theft is rarely
reported for student bikes, consider-
ing almost all are stolen anyway. It’s a
kind of recycling (bad pun, sony) that
goes on constantly. The average stu-
dent has three or four bikes stolen per
year, and it’s not unusual to have had
more than ten bikes stolen from you,
some having been in your possession
for only a couple of hours. Knowing
how to keep your bike from being

since Dutch thieves seem to be expert
1ock—cutters. ‘

Besides having to put a mini-
mum of two locks on your bike, it’s
also important to keep several factors
in mind. First and foremost, never,
ever park your bike at the train station.
It’s a thief ’s favorite spot. If at all pos-
sible, park your bike next to a poorly
locked bike or a new bike. Try to lock
your precious bike to something that
carmot be moved, like a lamp post or
street sign. Another helpful hint is to
be as creative as possible when apply-
ing the aforementioned paint or tape;
this could make it too identiﬁableto
be appealing to a thief. Unfortunately,
the best method is to never buy a nice,
new, or completely functioning bike,
as theft is fairly inevitable.

Having tested all of the above
methods, I can say that they are effec-
tive to a large degree (when combined
with some luck). My bike was cer-
tainly a prime example of a Dutch
student bike as far as its condition was
concerned. The chain was primarily
composed of rust and tended to "fall
off over bumps, the saddle was
removable, the left brake did not
work, the right brake sort of worked,
neither brake worked in rainy weath-
er, one of the front prongs’ was
cracked, and one of the pedals was
only halfthere. Ah, yes, it was a beau-
tiful bike, and I loved it for its best
quality, the one characteristic that

made it worthy and unique: by some

miracle it was never stolen in my
entire year in the Netherlands.

The future's so
bright, I need
my Bollés

M /// , r / /' '7’ //V

Judging from the 24,374 fans that
showed up for the Pitt—Kent State game
Saturday night, interest among the fans was
not soaring.

True, Pitt’s 52-14 victory over Kent was
expected. But, the victory is noteworthy for
several reasons.

First, it was Pitt’s ﬁrst win since the sec-
ond week of last season, a 66-30 thrashing of
Eastern Michigan. Pitt had lost ten consecu-
tive games until Saturday.

Secondly, the game gave Pitt a chance to
test several young players in game situations.
This is more important than anything.

With a killer road schedule and a disap-
pointing season opener, the chances of Pitt
playing in a bowl game are very slim. T'l1at’s
why Kent is on the schedule.

A win gives any team some conﬁdence.
Demond Gibson, a true freshman who
eamed his ﬁrst start against the Golden Flash,
has reason to be conﬁdent.

Gibson registered 1.5 sacks, a fumble
recovery, and a tackle for loss. Visions of
Hugh Green and Tom Turnulty are dancing
in my head

Dwayne Schulters demonstrated Pitt’s
depth at backﬁeld.

As Billy West compiled big numbers
(115 yards, one TD), Schulters showed Pitt
fans what he can provide for the offense.

  
  

\\
x
\‘

    

Schulters exploded for 98 yards and two '

electrifying touchdowns, so, when Billy
West declares his NFL eligibility at the end
of the year, Schulters will capably cany Pitt
through the next season.

The shock of the West Virginia debacle
still hasn’t worn off, even though that was
only one game, the ﬁrst game of a long sea-
son. Pitt has been written off because of that
one game.

Fans shouldn’t get too excited about the
blowout against Kent, either. Pitt whooped
one of the worst teams in the country. The
season won’t be a success because of it.

But, the important thing is this: the game
gave the fans a glimpse to the future, and that
future looks brighter than it’s been in the last
ﬁve years.

Mike Kovak is the sports editor for The Pitt
News.

   

Piﬂclefuses Golden Flush, 52-1 4 0

ifled Schano

Pitt erased‘ a disturbing trend on
Saturday by stomping Kent State University
52-14, ending a l0-gaine losing streak The
Panthers were able to hold off the rain clouds
looming over Pitt Stadium, as well as the out-
matched Golden Flash, to eam their ﬁrst vic-
tory of the season.

The Panthers put on an offensive show,
pounding out 329 yards on the ground and
525 total yards against the Kent defense.
Kent, meanwhile, mustered only 138 yards
total offense against the Pitt defense.

Running back Billy West led the Panther
charge, gaining 115 yards on 17 carries, with
much of the damage coming in the ﬁrst half.
Then, junior college transfer Dwayne
Schulters took over the spotlight, gaining 98
yards and two touchdowns.

Quarterback Matt Lytle completed 12 of
25 passes for 125 yards and two touchdowns
before being replaced by Pete Gonzalez at
11:09 ofthe third quarter.

Head Coach Johrmy Major’s enthusi-
asm was tempered after the game because he
understood the caliber of his opponent.

“We beat a team that is not very good,”
Coach Majors said. “I’m not in position to be
critical of any football teams, but they
weren’t very good, and we should have won
the ball game.”

Things did start slowly for Pitt, however.

Following a nice return on the opening
kickoff by Schulters to the Kent 42-yard line,
Pitt sputtered on their ﬁrst drive, going three
plays and out.

Kent set the tone on their ﬁrst possession
by ninning tailback Astron Whatley four
times. Whatley was the Golden Flash show-
case player, gaining 87 yards on 23 runs.

After two Kent punts, the Pit offense
began to shine. At 9:14 in the ﬁrst quarter,
Lytle completed his ﬁrst pass of the game to

Fullback Chris Schneider dives over the goal line to give Pitt at l4-7 lead.

wide receiver Mark Butler for a six—yard
gain. Following eight and 10 yard runs by
West, he scored Pitt’s ﬁrst touchdown of the
season at 6:59. _

The game remained relatively unevent-
ful until 2:04 of the ﬁrst quarter. VVith Kent
driving, junior strong safety Curtis McGhee
jumped in front of Kent quarterback Todd
Goebbe1’s pass for his ﬁrst career intercep-

tion. McGhee’s interception successfully"

snulfed Kent’s best offensive drive of the
half.

Kent’s ﬁrst touchdown of the game
came at the beginning of the second quarter.
At 11:25, Lytle and West rriisplayed a hand-
off as West fumbled into the waiting arms of
Kent free safety Rob Moore. Moore raced 38
yards to the Panther end zone, tying the game
at 7-7.

That miscue seemed to jurnpstart the Pitt
offense. On their next possession, the
Pantlreis drove 79 yards on 8 plays for their
second score of the game. .

The drive was highlighted by a 20-yard
Lytle completion to junior split end Jake
Hoﬁart and a 26-yard scarnper by Billy West.
At 8:32, sophomore ﬁillback Chris Schneider
capped the drive with a nine—yard touchdown
run. A Chris Ferencik extra point gave Pitt a
14-7 lead. '

Following a three-play drive by Kent,
Pitt, once again used a long drive to produce
points. This time, Ferencik chipped in a 30-
yard ﬁeld goal culminating a 10—play, 51--
yard drive, making the score 17-7.

Pitt scored again on their next drive. The
drive was highlighted by a third down draw
play that actually worked, netting an eight-
yard ﬁrst down 11111 by Schulters. At 1:26,
Schulters had a riine-yard touchdown run on
a delay to the right side, padding the Pitt lead
to 24-7.

Following the kickoff, the Panther
defense went on the prowl. On Kent’s fourth

“We were hectic the whole second
half,” said Pitt Head Coach Joe
Luxbacher. “They deserved to score ﬂie
goal.”

The Panthers played largely defen- .

sive soccer in the closing moments, with
most of the activity taking place in the
Friar’s offensive zone. The Friar ﬂurry
stepped up when the unofﬁcial scoreboard
clock froze at 1:59, giving the players a
tvvo—minute-warriing of sorts and putting
pressure on the Providence offense.

Nearly two minutes later, they-were

It’s safe to say that anyone who remote-
ly knew that Pitt was facing Kent State this
weekend was pretty conﬁdent in the fact
that Pitt would win. Granted, the Panthers
were handed a 34-0 whooping last week at
the hands of West Virginia in front of a near-
capacity home crowd, but this was different.
The only questions lay in the 29.5-point
cushion that the oddsmakers gave the
Panthers.

So for the second time in the past two
years, the Panthers beat up on a hapless

Mid-American Conference team before.

they set into a diﬁicult rnid-season trek Last
year, Pitt watched as Steve Clay took the
opening kickoff the entire length of the ﬁeld
before recovering and handing Eastem
Michigan a 66-30 defeat. The game against
Kent didn’t start as bad for Pitt, but, for
many people, the sight of a 7-7 tie midway
through the second quarter caused a few
worries.

Kent, Easter Michigan, what's the ffrce

Soccer

happen,” said Luxbacher, who denied using
a defensive game plan in the second half. He
did admit, though, that “it might have looked
that way.”

In the ﬁrst half, it looked like the
Panthers (2-0-1, 0-0-1 Big East) were well
on their way to continuing their two-garne
win streak \V1th 10:00 left in the ﬁrst, Pitt
sophomore Steve Hopper blasted a shot from
the outside into the Friar net to break the 0-0
tie.

Providence would respond less than two
minutes later when a perfect Friar inbound
pass set up a tying goal.

The Friar goal sparked the Panther
oﬂ°ense, who kept the ball in the attack zone
for the rest of the half. Tries by Dean Astoiino

V and Josh Brooks went unrewarded, but in the

39th minute, a header by'Drew Kopp cleared
Friar goalie Daniel Pires and gave Pitt the
lead. “When Drew gets the ball, he can
make good things happen,” said Luxbacher.

- “But we can’t rely on one guy. We need four

or ﬁve guys that can stick the ball away.”

Astorino, one of the team’s reliable play-
ers, was shutout for the ﬁrst time all season.
Another scoring leader, senior Keith
Hoetzlein, was also shutout, thanks to two
yellow cards and an ejection against SUNY-
Buifalo that forced him out of Sunday’s
action. ’

The scorers weren’t missed much in the
early going, but they were sorely needed in
the second half. Pitt had no serious scoring
chances and was saved on a few occasions
by only Spitz/er’s heroics. His biggest save of
the day, came on a penalty kick when he
robbed Providence’s Jonathan Crawford
with a sliding grab.

“You don’t win at this level if you don’t
p1ay.good defense,” said Luxbacher. ‘The
only reason we were in this game was that
Adam Spitzer kept us in it with some great
saves.”

 

   
 

9- A-_ p THE Pl'I"I'NEW$. .' —

Pitt proceeded to turn the game around
in the second quarter with a Washington
Redskins-type offensive explosion a la
Super Bowl XXII. Following Rob Moore’s
recovery of a Billy West fumble for a touch-
down, the Panthers took over at their own
20 yard—line with the score knotted 7-7. The
Panthers then took over the game by scoring
24 unanswered points to take a 31-7 lead
into the half. I

At the end of the ﬁrst quarter a year ago,
Pitt trailed Eastern Michigan 10-7, but
outscored the Eagles 31-7 in the second
quarter to take the wind out of EMU. The
comparisons between these two games
don’t end there. The balanced rushing attack
gave Pitt the lead in each. Demetrius Harris
had 149 yards and three TDs last year, while

Chris Patton and Vmce Williams chipped in
with 53 and 47 yards, respectively. Saturday,
Billy West led Pitt with 115 yards and one
score and juco phenom Dwayne Schulters
added 98 yards and two scores. Pitt took a 2-
0 mark and momentum into Texas, but lost
38-27. This marked the ﬁrst of ten straight
losses.

Pitt heads into a tough game against
Houston next Saturday at 1-1, and this could
turn out to be the test as to which Panthers’
team will show up the rest of the year.
Another win at home could give the
Panthers a lift before they hit the road for a
murderous away schedule, but a loss could
further hurt a team that can’t afford any ;.

play of the drive, quarterback Matt Goebbel
fumbled the snap and Demond Gibson
snatched up the ball at midﬁeld. After two
ﬁrst down pass completions, Lytle lofted a
touchdown pass to Mark Butler with only 15
seconds left in the ﬁrst half. The pass bal-
looned the Panther lead to 31-7 going into the
half and basically rendered the second half
moot.

Pitt started the second half with their
third straight touchdown dn've under one
minute inlength as Lytle threaded the needle
to wide receiver Curtis Anderson for a 38-7
lead at 13:09 ofthe third quarter.

Following that drive, the Panthers relied
mainly on their reserve players for the rest of
the game. Coach Majors was happy to get a
look at some other players.

“We played a lot of people that we badly

 

Monday, September , I996

needed to play,” Majors said.

The staff had to be impressed with a
number of players’ performances, especially
freshman Demond Gibson, who ﬁnished
with 1.5 sacks and a fumble recovery.

“It was real exciting to get my ﬁrst start,”
Gibson said. “This game gave me a lot of
conﬁdence. It doesn’t matter who we play
because we came out, and we won a game.”

Schulters was also pleased with his per-
fonnance.

“This week we had the ball a lot, and I
got to show what I can do,” Schulters said.

This was a game that gave a lot of Pitt
players a chance to show what they could do.
It was a good conﬁdence builder for a team
that badly needed a laugher.

And as Coach Majors put it: “It sure is
good to win!”
