Sulfur dioxide isone of the gases re-

burning cycle. Sulfur dioxide turns into

sulfuricvacid when it hits the outer air -

with itslwater content. Sulfuric acid
erodes metal causing the pit marks on
your auto; it eats out fabrics: bits into
wood sidings .on- your house. -Medical re-
searchers are zeroing in on respiratory‘
diseases to survey what it can do to your
lungs. . ' '

Folksinger Don McLean will launch
Pittsburgh's Environmental Teac.-In
on Wednesday at 10 a.m. at Flagstaff
Hill in Schenley Park. Following McLean.
there will be a “Walk for Life" down
Forbes Avenue to Duquesne University. a

For the past eight years Don McLean
has traveled and sung across the width
and breadth of America. He has played
at concert and club-engagements -with
Josh White. Pete Seeger. Arlo Guthrie.
and others. . '
"The mostexciting surprise of the
evening— was Don McLean who. while
singing. his own songs was able to cap
-ture the only encore of the evening._
A And that's not easy with Pete Seeger and
Arlo Guthrie for competition." said the
Albany-Times about a recent concert.

A Don McLean lives in Cold Spring-On-
Hudson and is deeply involved _with the
quest for‘ a pure, environment. Aside‘
from being on the board of directors of
the Hudson’ River Sloop, he has raised
thousands of dollars for this and related
causes. ‘ 7

He has appeared on the Merv Griffen
Show and NET Sounds of Summer.
"The Sloop atNyack»." t ’ * ‘

The purpose of the hour walk to Du-
quesne following McLean's presentation
is to demonstrate support for the Teach-
In and those groups active in seeking
solutions ‘ to
problems. 

The ‘parade _' permit includes leaving

Domes Creole 

Light; sound. smell. Multimedia.

Stanley . Shostak's multimedia lec-
tures are among the most exciting innova-
tions on this campus.

And Carnegies multimedia environ-
mental domes may well be the most ex-
citing presentation of the entire Teach-ln.

The Carnegie Environment Center
(CEC), in cooperation with the Environ-
mental Teach-In, will present a series
of environments in a complex of inflat-
able and rigid domes on the Carnegie-
Mellon University (CMU) campus.

Multimedia presentations in the dome
will run continuously throughout the
three-day April Teach-In. Through these
presentations. the CEC seeks to increase

-public awareness of environmental haz-
ards in general and pollution in parti-
cular.

The CMU display includes a series of
three inflatable domes joined by air-
lock_s. These three are constructed to be
viewed in sequence. *

All three inflatables are geodesic .
domes. That is, they are constructed of
light materials largely in tension. The
principle of the geodesic dome is toireduce
most structural stresses to" tensions

within the building materialsgand to min-V
imize the weight of the structures.

-Governor's   Proclamation

"The planet Earth has reached the
point at which its burgeoning human
population and sophisticated techno-
logy are threatening to upset irrevoca-
bly theecological balance.

The problem of waste is overwhelm-
ing. Every year Americans alone dis-
card 7 million cars, 100 million tires,
20 million tons of paper, 28 billion bot-
tles, and 48 billion cans. Each year
Americans alone spend $2.8 billion just
to collect garbage and our industries
discard 165 million tons of solid waste.

The air we breathe continues to put-
refy, as it has for the past 20 years, in
direct proportion to OUR increasing
prosperity and progress. United States
industries alone gush 172 million tons
of smoke and fumes into the air each
year. If present trends continue, air
pollution will double or even qua-

Pollution of our air, water, and
earth means disease,- ugliness, and
eventually an end to life as we know
it if we continue to ignore the problem.

Schools and their students and
teachers across the Commonwealth, in
cooperation with the Pennsylvania

State Education Association. are pre-
paring to participate in a massive na-
tionwide exposure of the terrors of en-
vironmental pollution in order to gain
strength for their movement to end
pollution. This effort will culminate
April 22 with a nationwide Environ-

mental Teach-in but their movement 

will continue.

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvan-
ia, very much aware of the importance
of protecting our environment. is also
involved in many projects to this end.
including our 1_0-year Project Environ-
ment, a ‘$500 million program to con-
serve and restore our natural resources.

Therefore, I, Raymond P. Shafer.
Governor of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, do. hereby proclaim Ap-
ril 22. 1970, as PENNSYLVANIA EN-
VIRONMENTAL TEACH-IN DAY and
urge every Pennsylvanian — for we are
all _polluters to some degree — and ev-
ery business and industry contribut-
ing to the destruction of our air.
water and earth to join with students
and teachers ‘to end the needless ‘ra-
vishing of our Natural Resources.

Where Do Tracks
Of Teach-in Lead?

So the Environmental Teach-In is on

» the tracks. The trick now is to get it roll-
ing.

Getting it on the tracks was an in-
spiring hassle-——a subtle unplanned mix-
ture if a priori structuring, ad hoc re-
action and picking up pieces. In part.
of course, this mixture resulted from our
having started late. It was the first week
in February when our feet first made
prints in the snow. In part also it re-
sulted from the very varied interests and

I emotional thrusts of the very different

members of the steering committee -
an exciting bunch to be a part of. And

. in part, the mixture was implicit in the

relationship of our drive to the social
and cultural number; we were a dis-
turbance to settled patterns of behav-
ior, not to make too fine a point of it;
the city has battle lines. and here was a
Pittsburgh
— entering the lists. What I'm talking
about is the radical left on the one hand,

business on the other, a high school
community torn within itself and. fin- I

ally, a vast and monumental indiffer-

 ence in the body politic in the face of

environmental problems of great urgency
and profound importance.

The radical left and the business

' right were at first a datum. The radical

left? by comparison with the business
«right the answer is yes. But I grew up
with the New Left in Britain. The

 language is similar, the views expressed

the same, their tenor more historionic,
the potential violence. Of them and
the power. structure (for which both
are to blame) more pervasive, it is
early days yet. The leftism of the thir-
ties in the USA is different from that
of today in two important respects -
it is not centered around jobs and it is
expressed by the young, the incidence
..ofwhom in the USA today is obviously
{so high as to carry within itself not
only the seeds of change but also
enough soil to surture them. Again it
is early days yet; and for a force to
make itself felt it will need the settled
disposition of a traditional body of

'. thought. The roots of the left of the

USA lie not in the USA but elsewhere,
the crystallization of an identity will
.-take time, the comprised of politics
, are years a-bonning, an ideal can be a
dangerous thing. So I say to the left:
-get together, with all the compromises

his--entails; argue the toss with indus-’

and do so with dignity; with all the‘
"compromises_this’ entails; beseach ye in
ll? '9.0W.e1s .~..of- Christi;that‘n‘-ye‘Imay’..-(from

- and its

 

time to time) be mistaken. We claim ,

the merits of a democracy. This needs
bodies. To remove legislators that give
off the air of small-minded men needs
bodies. support, discipline and a sense i
of the subtle web of desires. fears. ap-
prehensions. joys and motivation of
one’s fellow men. The pursuit of goals
exclusively through a dependence on_
the highest motives of mankind is a bar-
ren enterprise; it is the linking of one‘s
ideals with the strongest motives that
is required. And in so difficult an un-
derstanding only the steady amongst
us will remain. If one is after emo-
tional kicks masturbate on a carrousel.
don’t use the left movement.

Then there is business. industry. or
(as the left has it) the corporate power
structure. To someof the left. a nec-
essary and sufficient condition for a
beautiful world is the dismantling of
capitalism, whatever that might mean.
replacement by something .
else. In general the alternative sought
is state ownership. an even more terri-
fying prospect. One may live a moder-
ately good life in the space left by the
press of the bodies of ten villains. ‘One
villian filling the horizon, the mid-
dleground and the foreground‘ is a so-
cial disaster. And if we are to cast in-
dustry asa villain let us not hope to do
away with him but rather make him
less villainous. disarm him — make him

smile. even. There can be no doubt that .

in America today the power and
thoughtlessness ‘of industry and its self-
sufficiency. coupled with its preoccupa-
tion with either profits or its continued
existence is adeep source of sickness in
the body politic. It is a threat to indi-
vidual freedom. An obvious symptom
is the saneness of the appearance and
language of its spokesman and employ-

ees. The same charge may be made of

the left ,— beards and beads and san-

' dals are de rigueur. Yet since they are

not in power. the extent of their influ-
ence over the individual‘s appearance
(which is a fair test of where a man‘s
mind is at in these evil days of polar-
ization) is not a threat to this freedom.

To return: to do away with capital-
ism to involve oneself in a‘ hopeless
cause. To castigate its luminories as
prime causes of social sickness is to

2 miss the point.. At worst they can be

seen only as agents. It is _our job to
change the nature of the germ they

Teach-In Participation

To the Students of the University
of Pittsburgh:

The Environmental Teach-In brings
to the campus some of the most percep-
tive thinkers and imaginative men of
action in our country. As one of the
honorary co-chairmen for the pro-
gram. I am pleased to invite. and to
encourage. you to take an active inter-
est and participate in as many events as
you can.

It is fitting that students are now
becoming increasingly involved in en-
vironmental issues. It is no exagger-
ation to state that your continued health

I and happiness. and possibly even your

survival.) depend upon finding effec-
tive ways to stop pollution. The issues
are largely moral ones. issuesgwhich
youth can illuminate. It is neither
right nor economically sound to permit
our heritage of clean air and water to
be sacrificed for short-term benefits,
and I believe you will be persuasive
in urging necessary reform. And no-

where can you be more effective than

in helping to define your university’s
own role, for we as an institution have
a responsibility to study-and commun-
icate the grave facts concerning en-

vironmental deterioration which ' our
scientists report to us daily.

Our civilization has behaved arro-
gantly toward the earth and the won-
derfully varied life complex that it
supports. We have ignored the conse-
quences of pollution in the blind and
naive belief that man can control his
environment and make nature conform
to his wishes. As in the case of some

' racial attitudes and international pol-

icies, humility might serve us better.

The challenge that will be present-
ed during the next few days is a pro-
found one. We need to take it seriously
and become committed to change. But
"along with commitment, we must de-
velop insight and understanding. So I
hope and trust that the Teach-In will
be just a start, that it will prompt stu-
dents to ask the important questions and
search for the answers which no. one
has and which society can find only
through dialogue and cooperation.

Marc Hiller-and other students at
Pitt and the other colleges. are to be
congratulated for their work in organ-
izing the Environmental Teach-In the
program they have arranged.

means legislation. Legislation means
bodies. Hence the left must gather sup-
port, with" the. ramifications that this

- entails being those I described earlier. ‘

And by a change in the ground rules

. I mean a change in the climate within

which instutry operates. I mean the
nurturing of a modesty toward the en-
viroment. a .preoccupation with po-
tential degradation as a starting point,
a sense of what it is to live in a nature
fair. in short a sense of the art of

creating a civilization with a refer— ' .
ence point instead of a barbarism char-, -

acterized by a sucking desire for heed-
less change. unstoppable elephantiasis
and ignorance of unchangeable psychic
needs. ’ -

There is no doubt in my mind that
industry is about to meet its match.
The disgust at filth is increasing; spread-'
ing and become more intense with each
passing day. In a city like Pittsburgh the
struggle will be harder than elsewhere
from one point of view. This is that Pitts-
burgh has the smell of one of the most
(perhaps the most) feudal city in Ameri-
ca today. Thus it is easier to close ranks.
At the same time. the villian (to contin-
ue the metaphor) is more conspicuous.
With some exceptions. then. it has been
difficult to sell the idea of an Environ-
mental Teach-In downtown. At the same
time. those opposed are conspicuous.

Whence the source of the discom
fort? One firm "refuses to have any-
thing to do with the Teach-In either
financially or by sending participants
in panels. ‘Its spokesman have never
met me. nor any members of the steer- .
ing committee. The Board has madethe

I _ God’s sake.-it’fs'up to_you._~ - s  '_i_

 
   

closed attitude cannot but create prob-
lems for the firm in future, because
in our disgust we have many bedfel-
lows. So whatare we up to here?

The common thread linking the
members of this heterogenic steering
committee has been that the ETI should
be seen as an attempt to reduce polari-
zation and to _awaken interest in the en-
vironment where slumber prevailed.
However, one result has been that get-

ting acceptance for the ETI has been

an uphill struggle. Violence. or even
a sit-in. involving three people has
taken precedence in the news. Individ-

, ual interviewers have shown a mixture

of incipient dislike at worst and some
misunderstanding at best. But bit by
bitxthings are looking up. The impor-
tance of what we are all about is"
spreading. Between now and April 1
we’ll get -good coverage‘. And in so
new and delicate an enterprise it is
not to be wondered at that we have been
castigated as being co-opted by the anar-
chists and to a large extent shunned by in-
dustrvﬁ '

But we are now where I began. The
ETI is on the tracks. Its importance
no longer depends on us. but on you.
Can we then avoid the appearance
of certainly where we are deeply am-
bivalent; build with daring and mod-
esty; recognize the need for subtlety;
put up with incoherencies; and laugh
a. little at the profound tragicomedy
of our lives. with dignity "and respect
for the views of others? On_all this
the quality of a, civilization depends.

Editor's Note:
ment was delivered before the subcom-
mittee on Conservation and Natural Re-
sources House Government Operations
Committee by Denis Hayes, Environ-
mental Action national coordinator.)

Mr. Chairman: I do not plan to spend
time this morning cataloguing frightening
statistics on what we are doing to our
environment. You know and I know en-
ough right now to draw one conclusion:
we have to reverse our course. and we
have to do it at once.

But so far we have had only piece-
meal programs and insipid rhetoric. I
don't think that most of the politicians
and businessmen who are jumping on the
environmental bandwagon have the slight-
est idea what they‘re getting into. I don't
think they realize that we are going to
need fundamental changes i.n the values
of this country. I don't think they realize
that students see this as a long and ser-
ious fight for a profound change in what
this country is all about. They simply
don't have a clue to what we mean by
saving the environment.

They are talking about emission con-
trol devices for automobiles; we are talk-
ing about bans on automobiles. They are
bursting with pride over plans for muni-
cipal waste treatment plants; we are
challenging the ethics of a society that,
with only” seven percent of the world’s

population, accounts for more than half

of the world’s annual consumption of raw

' ' materials.

This country is robbing the rest of

the worldand future generations of their
natural resources. We have to stop.

This country consumes resources at an
extravagant rate and gags on its own
garbage. There is something drastically
wrong. Pollution ‘is only one symptom
of the environmental crisis in this na-
tion. We are spending insanely large

The following state-

sums on military hardware instead of el-
iminating hunger and poverty. We squan-
der resources on moondust while people
live in wretched housing. And we still
waste money and lives in a war we
should never have entered and should get
out of immediately. They are all a part of
our basic disregard for how people live.
and for the destruction of our surround-
ings.

We have made Vietnam an ecological
catastrophe. Vietnam was once capable
of producing a marketable surplus of
grains and rice. Now America must feed
her. We have left more than -500,000
acres barren. American bombs have pock-
marked the country with more than 2.5

million craters as much as 30 feet deep."

We have destroyed a quarter of the coun-
try’s mangrove forests, which shelter
protein-rich fish and shellfish; in their
place grow rat-infested forests of bamboo.

The destruction of the environment of
Vietnam is not simply a by-product of the
war. We are guilty of a direct. devastat-
ing. and inexcusable assault on that na-
tion‘s ecosystem. The United States. spent
73 million on defoliation in Vietnam in
the last fiscal year alone. Much of the
money went for the purchase and distri-
bution of Agent Orange. a powerful her-
bicide containing 2. 4. 5-T. which has
been shown to produce birth defects in
laboratory animals. We have dumped de-
foliants on Vietnam at the’ rate of 10,000
pounds a month, blackening in a single
year 6.600 square miles — an area about
the size of the state of Connecticut.

We cannot pretend to be concerned
with the environment of this or any other
nation as long as we continue the war
in Vietnam — or enter a similar war in
Laos or elsewhere.

But even if the war were over tomor-
row, America would still be killing this
planet. This country’s peaceful pursuits

are horrifying. Too often political and V H

business institutions seem inherently obli-
vour to the fact that some of us want to
live in this country thirty years from now.
Those institutions had better recognize
that fact, and soon. We don’t have much
time. We cannot afford to give them
much time.

Any day now a decision will be made

on just one more outrageous activity. The
Atomic energy Commission wants to set

off the largest nuclear cratering blast in

history. If the Undersecretaries’ Commit-
tee of the National Security Council ap-
proves. the STURTEVANT blast — 170
kilotons. 812 times as powerful as the
Hiroshima bomb — will be detonated in
Nevada this month or next. The test will
not be fully ‘contained underground. It is
designed to produce a crater as an exper-
iment in using bombs to build canals
and harbors. It will send an estimated 17
million curies of radioactiLe gas and de-
bris into the atmosphere. It would be ir-
responsible for the National Security
Council to approve the test.

As a direct consequence of man-
kind’s population growth and the unres-
tricted technological expansion we are
beginning to experience an ecological
crisis. We no longer can pick up a
printed paper or magazine without
reading of man’s effect on our envir-
onment. The environment has suddenly
become a big issue. Politicians. bureau-
crats, and businessmen are all leaping
to record themselves in favor of. a
cleaner environment. But the record of
achievement is bleak. It doesn’t take a
politician, or member of the ‘social
elite to recognize the problem, we are
all sensitive to the fact that our air is
getting smoggier. water is becoming
more polluted, and DDT is every-
where. Too many people are. all of a
sudden talking big. making promises
that they themselves know they won’t
keep, and in a sense adding to our
mind pollution. It's almost too latefor
talk, what we need is a great deal more
understanding of the ecological prob-
lem. Something more is needed than a
dose of American know-how; something .
more profound than sanitation is. at
