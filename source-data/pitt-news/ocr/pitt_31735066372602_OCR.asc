According to Delmontagne,
Powers and he then resignedifrom
the post they were elected to only
hours before. _Delniontagne then
went to see DeLuca to find out if
there were any violations.

According to DeLuca, Powers
and Delmontagne were not in'vio—
lation of either constitution, but
the two stuck by their resignations.

Davis, who was not in attenti-
ance at the Republican club meet-_
ing, ‘learned about his appoint-
ment when he returned to his fra-
ternity house, Phi Gamma Delta.

“WheriI returned to the house, I
was told that I was appointed busi-
ness manager,” Davis said. “I just
laughed, then
declined the position.”

Powers said that although it is
not customary to hold a first rneet—
ing of a student group at a frater-
nity house. they did so anyway to
“get the organization started.”

“Since Jeff (Delmontagne) and

Dan (Saint) are both members of
the same fraternity, and they are
near our house, we thought it
would be simpler and quicker to
hold it at the Pi house,” Powers
said. .
However, Saint was not
informed of the meeting.

The question of whether the

election wasagainst the College
Young Republicans’ constitution
\ still remains in limbo.

According to the constitution,
the officers have to be elected the
third week in March and the
members who elect the officers
have to pay the dues of $2 per year
for membership. None of the peo-

ple in attendance at Friday’s meet-
ing were ‘paying members,
_according to Saint and Powers.

Because
Republicans have been inactive for
over a year. there is also a question
of whether it is still a recognized
student organization.

Neitlier Powers, Delmontagne
nor DeLuca know what the status

. of the group is. DeLuca said that if

the organization is still recognized,
Powers and Delmontagne were -in

violation. If the group is not recog-

nized, they were not in violation.

DeLu_ca said he is unaware of
what the constitution of the Col-
lege_ Young Republicans states,

. and thatis why he told Delmon—

tagne thatthey did not break any

rules. i

Powers said he read the constitu-
tion of the organization but it was
“written for a group that had an
adviser.”

“We have to elect
order- to get an adviser,” Powers
said. “We can’t wait. until March,
we need an adviser now.”

Delmontagne said he was not
aware of the organization’s consti-
tution. He was also unaware
whether there would be a conflict
of interest with his position on the
board and his position in the new
group. He said he was unsure of the
SGB’s constitution.

“You (the reporter) f<I1('_)W more
about it (the constitution) than I
do,” he said. i ~

Delmontagne defended the
actions of Friday’s meeting by say-
ing it was necessary for the survival
of the club.

“"his isn’t the Republican

officers in '

party," he said. “We had to elect
people to see Ruth Lutl. (a previous
adviser to the group), so that it
could be recogaﬁzetl.”

DeLuca said it was not custom-
ary to haye a meeting of a student
group at a fraternity house, but it
has been done before by groups
that are just starting.

He said since the group was not
recognized, they did not have the
funds to conduct a meeting at a
more public place. DeLuca said
later that he was not sure if the

group held recognition or not, but

they had to elect leaders to get the A

“You can hardly go around

Davis said the club has not been
active for a year, and he felt the
recognition to be invalid. But he
said he declined the appointment
as business manager because he did
not have the time to put into it. He
defended Powers’ and Delmon—

tagne’s action by saying they
“probably thought that nothing
was wrong with it.”

.-\lthough Powers, Dehnontagne 
and l).a\'is resigned from the posi-
tions to which they were elected
and appointed, Aloe has not
resigned as president of the organi-
zation. Powers said he did not
know if Aloe intends to do so.

Del.uca said he will trythis week

recognized, but did not say if he
would take any action. S

 Opinion

Repubﬁcan
Miseries

It’s hard to take too seriously the actions of some
Pitt Student Government Board members this past
weekend. But “even though the methods they used to
try to re-establish the Pitt Republican Club may
haveiseemed somewhat comical, there is a serious
aspect to all this Republicanrevitalization.

To begin with, how many members of the SGB

‘ know or understand their own constitution? How

many are willing to bother to find out? These ques-
tions are important in light of the rationalizations
given for the short-lived Republican revival.

The whole issue began when board president
Todd DeLuca approached two students and asked
for their help in restructuring the now-defunct
Republican Club. At the board-meeting Friday, it

was announced that the first meeting of the club.-

would be held that night at the Pi Kappa Alpha
fraternity house. , '

Why the board waited ‘until 3 pm. Friday to
announce a meeting that would be held the very

same nightremains a mystery. Why was there a need «
to rush things? Also, since unfortunately only a

handful of Pitt students attend SGB‘meetings, did
the board really believe it would reach a majority of
interested students by announcing the meeting then?

‘ Why not wait and allow enough time to adequately .
publicize the meeting? ’ e

Other mysteries involved here are why the stu-
dents who wereoriginally told to organize the club
were not informed of the meetings until afterward,
why the club’s. membership then consisted of any-

where from nine to 13 members of one fraternity_, and

how the group could elect officers at its very first
meeting. I

Did the members believe they already knew each
other well enough to judge leadership qualities? Did
anyone mind appointing Spencer Davis to a posi-
tion without asking him first?

The board members interviewed, includin‘g.?De-
Luca, could not be sure whether they were in viola-

. tion of any rules in voting at the firstmeeting. They

were unaware if the group is a recognized one or not,
since it has been inactive this. past year. Jeff Delmon-
tagne’doesn’t even know whether his position as an

"officer of the Republican organization (if indeed, it

is an organization) is in violation of the SGB consti-
tution. He told the reporter, “You know more about
it (the constitution) than I do.”

The sequence of eventsthat occurred this past
weekend is complicated and full of unsatisfactory
explanations. The irony is that such a ‘messy affair
could really have been solved rather simply. We
would suggest that in the future the board members
make an effort to comprehend. their own constitu-
tion. and those of the groups they recognize, or are
trying to recognize again, before they set out on
another “revitalization” campaign. '

an article on the anti-choice rally
in the hope that the majority posi-
tion on this issue could also be
covered. As there was no The Pitt

TigerPa ul Displays »~'~ spirit

Dear Editor:

For the past 10 years Paul Aus-
lander, known affectionately as
“Tiger Paul", has successfully
aroused Pitt fans.

Unlike the Pitt cheerleading
squad, Tiger Paul has produced
cheers with good, clean spirit. The
Pitt cheerleaders, however, tend to
rely on punk rock dance move-
ments which ‘seem to encourage
violence against women to arouse
the crowd. Another way the cheer-
leaders attract the male fans is by
producing girls who have very lit-

tle on and who display what they

do have.

Karen Agostinella, chief advo- ,

cate for Tiger Paul’s dismissal,
states, “cheerleading should be for
the students, not for outsiders and
people off the streets.” I ask-you,
Ms. Agostinella, whenwe are no
longer students, should we not
contribute funds to the university
since we are now “outsiders and
people off the streets”?

Ms. Agostinella seems to be dis-
playing her frustrations towards
Tiger Paul because Tiger Paul can
arouse the crowd while‘ her cheer-
leaders cannot. '

Does it matter who arouses the

fans? We are here to have a good

time and support our team.
Finally, I appeal to you, Ms.
Agostinella: Swallow your pride

anci-put away your jealousy, if not-

for Tiger Paul, then for the fans
(who provide jobs for the
cheerleaders).

“We have trictl to work with the
promoters in jointly staging a
superstar, but quite frankly, some
of the promoters have intimidated

» us out of the business. This is not

only true.‘ at Pitt, but nearly any
other school who faces this kind of
competition. For example, Penn
State has no promoter competition
in State College; this is why they
can get superstars like Bob Dylan,”
Jackson said.
“David Brenner, Carly Simon,
and the Commodores were all

‘ entertainers whom we nearly had,”

Jackson said, “but promotercoer-
cionlnullified all efforts.

“Even if we (PPC) have gotten a.

He said there are three places to’
stage a rock concert in Oakland:
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
Hall, Carnegie Hall and the Syria
Mosque. '

.But, he said, because" all three
places are too “respectable” and
expensive to rent’, “it would be
cheaper to buy the Civic Arena for
one night.”

Other facility alternatives within.
the university are Trees Hall and

the Field House, according to
Jackson. .
“Because of the , controlling

vested athletic interests. trying to

keep concerts out of the Field
House, the costs would be tremend-

ous. Tliey’re worriedabout the.

damage that might come to uni-
versity facilities,” Jackson said.
“But we are starting an intense

effort to get the Field House and we
need student support—we must
‘build a mutually beneficial coali-
tion with students; we are working
for them.

“It’s bad enough we must deal

area, but we do not want to deal
with the politics within the univer-
sity,” J'a'ckson. continued. “We
would like to overcome the obsta-
cles within the’ universityhcom,-.
munity as opposed to fighting the
promoters.” «

Even if we do get free facilities or
for an inexpensive cost, the third
obstacle involves student apathy,
Jackson said.

The Atlanta Rhythm Section
and Pablo Cruise’ performed at
Pitt’s 1981 homecoming concert
staged at the Syria Mosque.
According to Ed’Kelly, former con-
cert _cliairperson of the PPC, if a
“st~il3statitial” loss of money was
in,curred by the university because.
not enough students attended.

“We have presentations of this
caliber, and students are not show-
ing up,” Kelly said. “It is true that
because of agency and promoter
heat we could not advertise‘ this
concert anywhere else but The Pitt

-News (radio or other newspapers),

yet the message of the concert still
should have reached at least. 13,000
students. We had about 3,000 at the
concert.” > . '

order to gather their ideas in regard
to concerts. Most students, being
despondent about the concert
situation, offer little participation

in amending the predicament,
Miller said.
The concert committee will

explore numerous possibilities
with the hope of improving the
situation. Miller said this can not
be done without student input.
Some of the “reform” possibili-
ties the concert committee is exa-
mining, according to Jackson,

include:

.  working with thepromoters in
Jointly staging concerts;

local bands in

Secondly, one class in Pitt’s

marketing research project to
review what Pitt students want. If
successful, this program "will nar-

row the focus” of what groups to

The final reform proposal is a

soon the “difficulties” will be

together towards arriving at a mut-
ually beneficial solution.” _

Said Director of Student Activi-

The Pitt News, Monday, January 25, 1982

By AMlN ‘GHPOSSEIN

He labored for more than two
seasons on the Pitt Panther bench,
shackled by coaches who either
preferred other players or were

' scared to let him play. He was raw,
talented and unpredictable. The
few precious minutes of playing
time he saw were often disastrous.
He would press, so eager was he to
contribute, and he would lose con-
trol of his own enormous -skills.
And then he would be back on the
bench.

Go to a hypnotist, coaches told
him. Calm down, control yourself.
Darrell Gissendanner tried every-
thing, so great was his hunger to
play.

Then came the boiling point. It
was against Duquesne last year at
the Civic Arena. Inserted to harass
Duquesne guards, Gissendanner
did more than that, he made a
mockery of them. And then the
familiar substitution and he was
back on the bench.

Gissendanner could take no
more. He banged his fist on his
accustomed seat and screamed, “I
want to ,play.’-’ He had had enough.

He needed to play, but not the
ephemeral glimpses of action. He
couldn’t handle that—-his play
couldn’t adjust to it. Blessed with
an uncanny quickness and a desire
to be involved in every play, Gis-
sendanner needed to be allowed to
play. 1

Let him make mistakes, but
leave him in the game and the posi-
tive will outweigh thenegative.

just, ask the Rutgers Scarlet‘

Knights. Ask them about Darrell
Gissendanner. Ask them about the
senior from Clairon who scored 19
points after coming off the bench
and stole a ballgame in their own
backyard. A ballgame the Pitt
Panthers were never supposed to
win.

Trims
Pill

By MARIE HUFF

If you were a member of the Pitt
Lady Panther basketball team, you
would truly believe that these were
the dog days of summer. Tl1el.ady
Panthers, who did everything right
but win Saturday night, have now
dropped three in a row, dropping
their record to 10-7. Their latest»
opponent, the sixth-ranked Mary-

land Lady .Terrapit1s, escaped by
the skin of their teeth 71-72.

The Lady Panthers, down 62-53
with seven minutes remaining in
the game, rattled off eight unan-
swered points in the following
three minutes to pull within one
62-61. The (‘l12tl‘f't’ was led by Carol
Dugan, who satrk a pair of 14-foot
jump shots.

Maryland could not build more
than a three-point lead over the
Lady Panthers until the 2:13 mark,
when Myra \-‘raters converted a»

'I’errapins a 71-66 edge. However,
Pitt’s Jennifer Bruce hit the second
half of a two-shot foul, and Gail
Aughburns put in a layup with

Pitt coach Roy Chipman recog-
nized Gisse'ndanner’s—talent. He let
Giss play last year down the stretch
and in the playoffs, and he
sparkled. This year henamed him
co—captain and made him a starter.
He let the Gissendanner talent do
the rest.

Few stayed with him. He burned
Tennessee for 25 points. His explo-
sive speed wreaked havoc amongst

‘opposing guards. But there was

still something missing.

In his haste to contribute, Gis-
sendanner would sometimes try to
over-contribute. He would take it
upon himself to make the move to
the basket, he would take it upon

‘himself to win. Not that he was

selfish.

Giss has always been the ulti-

mate team player. Diving on the
floor for ball.s, hurling his slim,
muscular body into the bench sav-
ing a ball were, for him, just a part
of the game.

It was his personality hn the
floor. He always wanted‘ to do
something. always wanted to con-
tribute. Chipman realized this, but
he also realized that Giss’ overanx-
iousness could be mellowed, could

» be honed to suitthe needs of the

coach and the team. And, in the
end, maybe even his own.
Chipman made Gissendanner
the sixth man. not to demote him,
but to let him view the action from
the sideline..*\ sortof fiveto seven
minute skull session. Let him see
the action, let him see what’s going
on. And then let him explode.
And Gissendanner did so against
Rutgers. He accounted for more
than one—third of his team’s 48
points after coming off the bench.
With a sizzling eight-of-12 from the

field, Giss’ performance helped,

Pitt beat Rutgers for the first time
ever in the regular season.

Lose to LaSa//e

By SEAN BARNES

The Pitt Panther swim team suf-
fered its first loss of the season Sat-
urday to a well—prepared LaSalle-
team. The 72-41 loss did however
yield much improved times for the
Panthers. Pitt’s Sandy Pidgeon and
lid Bergan each set a pair of pool
records.

Pidgeon, who was a triple-
winner last week as Pitt defeated
Penn State, repeated his triple-
winning performance Saturday.
Pidgeon taptured the 200-yard
individual medley and the 200—yard
breaststroke. His 20()—yard individ-
ual medley time of 1:55 as well as
his 2:07 mark in the 2()0—y;trd
breaststroke were both new pool
records. l’idgeon’s third win came
in the meet’s opening event-the

1lO()-yard medley relay of Bergan,

Pidgeon, Geoff lfmore and ‘Ierry
7.aleski. Their time of 3:31.28 is
their season's best and well on track
as they peak for the Eastern
Regionals at Pitt beginning March
-1.

Bergan's opening 100-yard back-
stroke split of.'32 seconds in the -100-
yard medley relay was his first pool
record of the meet. Bergan later
individually swam the 200—yard
bacltstroke in a record-breaking
l:.3-l. Bergan is now heavily-
lavored to win both backstroke
events at liasterns, and if he con-
tinues his current pace, he may he
one of the top twelve hackstrokers
in the country when NCAA
Nati()nals roll around.

I AVESOMETHING to I

Chris Femiani LeadsGymnas

By JOHNETTE IHOWARDI

Pitt Panther gyriitiagtjcg
Coach Frank D'Amico hm]
enough worries heading into
his team’s season opener
Saturday———one of his top gym-
nasts, previous national quali-
fier Frank Kratz, was out of
competition with the flu and
the coach was relying on two
unproven freshmen gymnasts.

Iinter Chris Femiani. himself
a frequent cause of concern for
D'Amico, a man driven just
short of hand—wringing as his
team took the floor Saturday to
face William and Mary and host
James Madison University.

Femiani, along with senior
Bob Besong, turned in solid,
high—scoring to pace Pitt to a
250.65-243.5 season—op_ening
win over lV8cI\l. JIVIU finished ;1
distant third with 187.3 points.

Femiani, a free—spirited jtIn-
ior who drives D’Amico into fits
of anxietywhenever_he takes the
floor, captured one first-place
and three second—place spots.
Such success is logic—defying. In
the highly-regimented routines

of gymnastics, Femiani is a free: «

lancer.

“He sometimes changes his
routines. He goes ou_t on the
floor and just starts creating. I
"get worried," D’Amico said
laughingly.“Sometimes he
justs forgets what he’s doing. It
just turns out. When I think of
how much I train with him, and
he still forgets...” D’Amico
laughed again.
Complementing I“emiani’s
strong showing (he. took first
place in the rings and second in
the all—around ,vault and paral-

lel (hairs) was the Pantliers”

Besong, with five top finishes in
six events. Besong, also a
national qualifier last season.
took first in the parallel bars
and all-around, second in the
floor exercise and rings, and
third in the vault. ‘
Pitt’s third national quali-
, fier, Dave-(Smith, also contrib-
uted ' with a second—place
performance in the‘ floor exer-
cise and third-place efforts in
the'vault and rings. D'Amico

praised Smith for his rapid pro- I

gress in recent, weeks.

“He was one.of the surprises
of the Ineet. He qualified for
Nationals on the floor, and he's

it a very good vaulter, but he's

made great, great strides in the
all-around,” D’Amico said.

 

Chris Femiani placed in fourot six possible events Saturday as Pitt won its season opener.

D’Amico also commended
the performances of freshmen
john Gartside and Eddie Mil-
ler. D’Amico had intended to

R bring the two rookies along"

slowly in the early season and,
until Kratz became ill, neither
was scheduled to compe'te.Both
freshmen filled in with solid
scores, especially in the last
event—the high bar——to lock
Pitt’s win.

“I was really sweating it out
through the first two (freshmen
performances) on the high bar.
Both freshmen came through
super. Boy, was I happy,"
D’Amico said. “Both did solid
jobs. When they came off, I

knew we had the meet won.’

Under newly installed NCAA
rules this year, teams are now

limited to only 10 performers L

instead of the ‘former 12 per
meet. Coinciding with the
paring-down in team sizes was a
cut down of performers per
team per meet. — '

Under the old rules, each
team could ‘enter six gymnasts
in each of the six events, and
each team retained the topfive
scores in each event. Now, each
team enters only five performers
per event, and all live scores
count toward the team score.
Obviously, such a system mag-
nifies the importance pt poor-

scoring routines, as well as the
likelihood of a coach’s
headaches. ' r I

“If you miss _a routine,. it
could turn, the whole meet
around,” D_’Amico sighed.
“'I‘hat’s why _I was so worried
with Frank (Kratz) out, but
everyone did a great job.”

liven Femiani, whose two
previous, Pitt seasons have been

distinguishedasi much for his *

many injuries as his off-the-
wall antics and meet perfor-
mances, 'did well. His
performance ‘in Saturday’s meet
was a bit of a surprise consider-
ing he is still working himself
back into top shape following a

s to Vic

 

 

wrist injury. He had hiscast.

removed just before Christmas.

But as far as surprises go,
D’Amico seems ‘resigned to
expecting them from Femiani,
who D’Amico says, “defies phy-
siology.” Femiani is known for
throwing difficult moves in

(meets, such as a double-back

somersault, without ever prac-
ticing or planning them.

“He’s one of those people
who is outtfor two weeks and
comes back better than ever,”
D’Amico said. “You never
know what he's going to do. He
doesn't tell anyone.”

§aturda‘y, at least, Femiam's
results were worth discovering.

Lady Gymnasts Give Great Effort but Lose

By BRIAN BALK

Despite the Pitt Lady Panther
gymnastic Leam’s 138.65 to 133.50
loss to the very strong Michigan
State Spartans Saturday, the Lady
Panther gymnastics team gave one
of the finest performances of the
season. _

“We really didn’t pay attention
to what Michigan State was doing.
we concentrated on our own per-

1

if‘.

formance," said Pitt Coach Donna
Sanft. t

Sanft‘s main objective going
into this meet was to make sure a
“string of bad meets" did not per-
sist. Last week's loss to the Univer-
sity of Maryland was a full ten
points lower than this»week’s score
of 133.50. 1

Three excellent individual per-
formances were turned" ‘in by

seniors Holly Martino and Regina

Carson and sophomore Karen Mar-

Weinschenkerpho

tin. All three posted their highest
all-around scores of the year. Mar-
tino lead the 'ay with her fourth-
place finish of 34.4, followed by
Martin with  and Carson
with a 

In the vault, it was Martino and
Martin, who again registered the
leading scores for the_I-ady Panth-
ers. Martin stuck her full-twist
move on the vault for a 8.55, and
Martino’s handspring fullltwist
was good enough for a 8.65 score.

The uneven parellel bars were an
event full of improvement and
potential excellence for the female
gymnast, said Sauft. Senior Rox-
anne livans, who was hampered by
a shoulder injury which she suf-
fered in last week’s meet, executed a
fine routine with only one minor
fall on her difficult dismount.’

“lf Roxanne cleans up her rou~
tine in just a few places, thejudges
andl both agree that she has the
potential to be scoring in the
nines,” Sanft said.’

The uneven bars were also high-
lighted by Carson, who, with a
“fantastic start," perforrned one of
her best routines. Martin's mount
was impaired by some camera
cables (television was present to
cover the meet), but she still had the
ability to finish smoothly.

Sanft said that Pitt was “superior
on the floor exercises,” even
though the scores didn’t reflect it.
Still, the coach was philosophical.

“Out of the four scores that
counted we hitall four,” Santf said.

The Lady Panthers i also
decreased their errors in the bal-
ance beam event. .,Senior Karen
Zandi, although her routine was
marred by two falls, still scored a
7.85. Sanft predicted that without
the two falls Zandi’s score for the

routine should hover between a

solid 8.5-8.9. junior «Gretchen
Spiech, though still bothered by
leg injuries, also pulled through
with a 8.0'routine.

Looking ahead to mid-season
eased Sanft’s adverse reaction to
Saturday’s loss.

“With so many girls out with
injuries, the pressure is really on
those who are competing. So
whenever we are back with a full,
healthy lineup, the girls will have
the experience of pressure, and big

. meets like Penn State will seem like

nothing, said Sanft.

Next Saturday the Lady Panth‘
ersi travel to the University of Mis-
souri for the prestigious Cat
Classic, which features five of the
nation’s toughest teams. The field
includes Louisiana State Univer-
sity (which has already posted

scores of 1415), Missouri. and Pitt

rival Penn State. ESPN, the all-
sports cable-TV network, will tele—
vise the meet. P’

Lady Panthers Lose

in on one of two freebies. Angli-
burns laid one in off the glass for
Pitt, and it was again a two-point
game 74-72. This time, though,
only 25 seconds remained.

Pressure from the Pitt press,

which was effective all‘ night,
forced Maryland to turn the ball
over with 1-1 seconds left. The Lady
Panthers took three shots at the
basket, all futile, and Maryland
preserved their status as the No.6
team in the country. Pitt mean-
while moved one step closer to a
re(‘or(l they don't want to set——the
team’s longest losing streak. The
record is four, set during the 1977-
78 season.

In the l)eginn_ing, itappeared as

an 11-2 lead _in the opening five
minutes of play. Then the'Pitt
defense, playing the best it has

played all season, buckled down

burned the Lady Panthers in the
final five minutes of the half. Pear-
man hit a 12-footer with five
seconds left to give Maryland a 34-
33 halftime lead. M

Freshman Jennifer Bruce was
almost unstoppable for the Lady
Panthers. Bruce had a game-high
29 points and collected 10 rebounds
on the night. Debbie Lewis added
11 and Carol Dugan 10 in the loss.
Pitt's Gail Aughburns led everyone
with 17 rebounds.

The Lady Panthers must now

prepare to host West Virginia Wed-
nesdaynight. The Lady Mountain-
eers are one of only three teams on
P1tt’s schedule that had a losing’
season last year. The game should,
not be so much a test of Pitt’s tal-

liGiss and

By SCOTT DELLETT

A good swim -team never shies
away from a challenge. The l’itt
Lady Panthers look forward to
challenge with the biggest dual
meet of the season-—they hos1
defending Eastern (Ihampion
Princeton tomorrow afternoon at
Trees Pool at 3:3().

continued from page ten

Vaughan turning in his worst
offensive game of the year and Pitt
down by eight, Gissendanner
played Mr, Offense and a little “D”
too. He stole a ball and scored a
lay-up. He pulled up a succession
of jumpers off his dribble. He blew
by Scarlet ‘Knights on his way to
another lay-up. He gave his team a
l0-point cushion. And even
though they.wouldn’t hit a bucket
for the last eight minutes of the
game (the only point was a
Vaughan foul shot), it was enough-
Thanks to Gissendanner and a
new, rejuvenated Pitt defense, the
Panthers won a low-scori11g
, game-the kind they made a habit
of winning last year. With Roose- -
velt Kirby at center throwing his
sizeable body around and being the
intimidating force everybody fi_g-
ured he would be, and Andre Willi-
ams at forward helping out on the
~ boards, the Panthers 'kept'Rutgers
.._.aLbay. Roy.".Hinson and Clarence,
Tillman, the twin-tower killers of
Rutgers, could only-muster a six-
of-18 day from the floor.
Darrell Gissendanner did better
than that all by himself. just ask ‘
the Scarlet Knights.

According to coach Dave Belo-
wich, “the team must come up
with a superior effort to defeat the
Lady Tigers."

“Princeton has no weaknesses,"
Delowich said. “They're strong in
every event. The only way to win is
to continue to swim fast, and to
have improvement by the whole
team‘:”

shape they're in,"
admits. _

This is another test that will lead

for the Panthers.

“ It was a meet where LaSalle fol-
lowed their strategy to a tee," said

Lewis. “They had to not make any
tnistakes and they didn't—-not a
single one.”

Pitt’s winning edge was blunted

as the team lost its two top divers.
Shawn McI.ane, a national .'quali-
Iier in high school, went out early
in the season with a knee injury
and transferred to a school closer to
his home in Virginia, and Mike
Minik quit the team to concentrate
on his schoolwork.

The two team defections have

left the diving team and Coach
Julian Krttg in a bind. The bind is
that Pitt has only anemale diver
left-—sophomore Rex Nordheiiner.
Although Nordheimer has a good
list of dives on both boards, Pitt is a
marked team. I
A swim meet is composed of 13
events-—two of which are diving.
Therefore, 18 of the meet‘s I13 pos-

sible points are awarded in diving. .

Pitt now loses these
“ events.
