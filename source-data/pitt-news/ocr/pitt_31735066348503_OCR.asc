. P damage charges in dorm hallways
and lavatories among the individ-
V _ ual students on a ﬂoor at Wednes-
day's meeting of- the Student
Affairs Advisory Com " ee.
SG president Larry Pl tt asked for
a re-evaluation of the present
dormitory housing contract com-
plaining there was nothing con-
crete included in the contract
concerning maintenance policy.
“Somewhere it should be written
down that students are entitled to
regular maintenance and servic-
ing,” he said.
Stairwells, hallways, and lavator-
' ies were listed by Platt as the most
important areas for guaranteed
maintenance.
He also expressed interest in
‘ _ “probing the high absenteeism”
among Housing__ personnel, to
determine to what extend the
absenteeism affects maintenance.
During the dorm» maintenance
discussion, SG_ Legal Awareness
-Committee chairman Kevin Joyce
criticized the billing of 30 Tower C
residents for damages resulting
from vandalism last November to
the ﬂoor’s lavatory. _
Each of the students is being
charged $8.95 for the damages.

The hiring freeze announced by

"Chancellor Wesley Posvar’ may

result in fewer professors teaching
larger classes, according to Faculty

of Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome

L. Rosenberg. A

“Vacancies are obviously oc-
curing despite the freeze, and
naturally, we must fill them or
cease functioning as a university.
But faced with the economic
limitations, we have to establish
priorities,” Rosenberg said in a
Tuesday interview.

“Those priorities are generally
that new people will be hired only
when no. other professors in a

department can teach largernv
said Rosen--

99

sections of a class,
berg.
1 “We will ﬁrst- talk with current
personnel to establish if they are
able to ﬁll vacancies on the staff. If
they are not, then we will hire new
people,” he emphasized. ’ ‘_ ’

Posvar announced the: hiring
freeze in a Pitt Update released
February 3. “Filling of only those
positions considered essential to
the performance of the mission of a
given office, department, or school
will be approved,” read the
statement.

‘Posvar indicated the economic

constraints were the result of
Governor Milton Shapp’s refusal to
sign Senate /Bill 1953 which would
have given Pitt $1.3 million to meet
rising education costs. P ’
“Governor Shapp is expected to
release his budgetin early March,
and Chancellor Posvar will probab-
ly prepare the University budget in
late March. Until then, we’re just
working on a day to day and case to
case basis,” Rosenberg said.

Strategy for influencing State
legislators to allocate Pitt the
funds necessary to avoid a tuition

, hike was discussed last night at a

University Board sponsored meet-
ing of major campusgroups.

The University Board, comprised
of leaders of the three campus
student governments, has begun
organizing students and student
groups to attempt to avoid a
possible increase‘ in tuition. The
meeting attracted approximately 25
students. P

Undergraduate Student Govern-
ment President Larry Platt pro-
posed a campus-wide campaign
urging students to contact their
local State legislators asking that
Pitt be given’ the requested $62
million. ‘
A “The more contact the legistlators
‘get, the better/our chances are,”
-Platt said. .1

Platt also suggested students urge

their parents to write..or call local

State representatives. . V .
4 The University‘Bo'ard plans, with
the assistance" of the groups rep-
resented at last night's meeting, to

inform students how to inﬂuence

the State House and Senate mem-

bers. Plans are also underway to
provide information to the legisla-
tors concerning the effects of a
tuition hike. '

“We needto show ﬁgures proving

‘x’ percentage of ' students gradu- '

ating from Pitt stay "in, the State.

. This will justify the State expendi- ‘
V ture (to Pitt),” Platt explained. '

Graduate Professional Student
Association representative Nick’
Axten told the meeting “a concer-
ted ‘state-wide effort” is being
formulated. ' "

SGB Opposes Ziegler Speech

The Student Government (SG)
Board voted at last Wednesday’s
meeting to oppose the decision of
last year’s SG Board to bring in as a
speaker former president Nixon’s
press secretary Ron Ziegler.
According to Board member Mark
Satinoffs proposal, “The current
Student Government Board stands
in opposition to the decision of the
former Student Government Board
and Programming Committee to_

pay Ron Ziegler $2500 to speak on

campus.”

The proposal was approved 4-1-1

Posvar to ask that the three campus
student governments be included
in the final decision-making meet-
ings on raising tuition. “At that
time, he wasn’t ready to agree to
that,” Platt said.

Governor Milton Shapp is expec-
ted to release his 1975-76 budget
early next month opening it to the
scrutiny of the State House and
Senate. Until Pitt’s budget allot-
. ment is ﬁnalized, no decision on
tuition increase will be made.

talk) died when it was not second-
ed. .

Commenting on the motions, SG’s
Craig Bluestein said," “Although I
feel the Programming Committee
acted quite responsibly in contract-
ing Mr. Ziegler, the. majority
opinion of the Student Government
Board is that we should not help a

man in proﬁting by virtue of his_

participation in the Watergate
scandal. "

“We feel that his notoriety was
only achieved through his partici-

, pation in Watergate and not by his

position as press secretary to

President Richard Nixon.”
Bluestein added the Programming

Committee had’ admitted they

' wanted Ziegler for_ his notoriety

and not because he was a presi-

_ dential press secretary.

Bluestein asked, if a press secre-
tary was wanted, why didn't they
ask some other former press secre-
tary to speak.

An :earlier motion by Satinoff
requiring the Board to attempt to
prevent Ziegler from speaking at
Pitt failed by a 4-1-1 vote. , ‘
Satinoff’s reasoning behind the
move was Ziegler would see he was
unwelcome and break the contract.
Dan Stifﬂer questioned the prac-
ticality of the move, commenting if

The announcement in late Janu-
ary Ziegler was to speak here met
with mixed student reaction. The
controversy climaxed at the last
meeting of the former SG Board on

February‘5 which resulted in their .

approval of the Programming
Committee invitation. Ziegler

days later due to personal reasons.

Dear Editor, ~

.. his letter is being written in
Response to the article that ap-
“eared in the February 19th issue
_the_ Pitt News. The article of
controversy was done by Doug
Gebhard on his review of the Led
Zepellin concert. Mr. Gebhard’s
assertion of the present status of
Led Zepellin as being “washed
up” greatly infuriated me.

After reading your article I won-
dered if you saw the same concert
that»I did. You make reference to a
lot of flaws, such as Robert
?hnt’s voice being inaudible. This
statement made me seriously
think, did you stay longer than the
 three songs? I- feel that credit
should ,be given where credit is
due, evidently you do not. We must
realize that it does take time to get
Ylafmed up and for the technicians
tofget the proper mix for the crowd
(in; the arena. Surely there is a
difference ln_a rehearsal session in
 empty arena and an arena with a
sell-out crowd! There is also a
3,-definite difference between a stu-
_,di,o recording and a live concert.
"But —I feel that Led Zepellin, (the
;proper spelling), did an excellent
ijoh in delivering their songs. Did

  Yes, We Got N 0 Frontier

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

A MYSTERY REVEALED TO
THE READER

Welcome to the foxhole, America.
Up to our pink ears in mud, we will
squat out this decade (it seems)
leaving no lasting memory except
the frenzy « of our attempts to
maintain the Middle of the Road.

These’ days the Frontier seems to
be a lost commodity. Maybe it sank

- with Atlantis, or maybe they sold it

to the Russians. Maybe the Egyp-
tians buried it with their freeze-
dried kings. But whoever lost the
Frontier should be hung, ’cause all
God’s children. need Frontiers,
and we need ‘one now.

There is nowhere left to go,
friend. In the language of cost-
benefit analysis we can’t afford the
frightening social explosion of ano-
ther Frontier. .

What happened to the energy
which once kept the ball rolling?
What happened to the mystery and
challenge of the Edge-of-the-
World??

AN HISTORICAL CASE IN
‘ POINT

History has Christopher Colum-
bus down as blowing the last of the

. mega-Frontiers, the Ne'w World.

Chris must have been a dreamer,
and I’m convinced he wasn’t after
the American continent, or Cathay,
or money. It becomes more and

more obvious [if you think about it] V

he was looking for the Edge-of-
the-World. _

This slap—happy sailor realized no
one would ﬁnance a deal, like that,
so he dusted off the “round earth”
can (once used by the Greeks) and
set up the Spanish like -bowling
pins.

With crazed giggle in his throat.
Chris hitjhe High Seas, absolutely
convinced he was going to whip off
the Edge and right into infinity.

America got in the way.

His hopes shattered, Chris head-
ed back to consolation in doses of
foxglove and wine, and death in a
jail-cell. - -

Some say he committed suicide,
and it was hushed up by Spanis
authorities. ‘ l

And in a nutshell, this was the
death of the greatest Frontier of all
time. Since then théy’ve been
harder and harder to find, and
more expensive to reach.

. Not that there aren’t any Frontiers

to be had, it’s that they have been

replaced by the diligent excavation

(40 hours a week since 1972) of our _

own grave.
Take one look at the hands of your

Letter to the Editor

senator, congressional leader or
gizmo-man in ‘ Washington and

consider the great, painful cal- '

louses.

THE wonsmp or STAIBILITY

The reason the Frontiers dried up
recently is we exchanged them for
some glass beads and security.
Never in the history of the planet
has a decade gotten off to a more
sterile start than the 70’s.

We are wallowing deeper and ‘

deeper into a national coma that
will see thousands killed on high-
ways as they drift into a slumber,
housewives roasted as they nap
over burning stoves, millions
breaking their necks as they nod off
going down stairs.

Our society is so complicated that
there‘ is no more room for the
fundamental leader, the Tribal
Chieftan, the Divine King. Our
nation is run by harried executives,
the legions of ‘Managers.

No more great leaders, bright or
dark. We had to squeeze the life
out of Hitler, someone felt obliged
to murder Shining John and all the
rest. Leaving us with the Managers
who diddle about energetically,
maintaining a gradually declining
situation. -

Hard at work grappling with the

’ latest tremor of the economy, we

cannot afford to locate and define
anymore Frontiers, we will briskly
repair this place forever.

YES, WE GOT N0 FRONTIERS

No more West, no more North
Pole, no more Dark Continent, _all
of it mapped by satellites.‘

So we «stand and scream at this
planet, deep in the grip of relent-
less economics and gravity,‘ all
gussied up with nowhere to go.

They've been using" a lot of
substitutes, the nostalgia of the
past, the science-ﬁctibn of the
future, induced. superstition by
special-effect demons, pharmaceu-
tical blackjacks and vision-twis-

R ters.

But’ through all the haze of the
pseudo-Frontiers, the urge to move
on is still there.

Maybe that’s why Star Trek is so
popular: “Get us the "hell off this
crummy planet, and so what if
some of us. get "eaten, dissected,
mutated, zapped and scrambled,
it’s worth it.’  V

But the long‘-run challenge has
been forfeited for the short-run
interests of stability.

The Frontiers of space and ocean
are too expensive just now, al-
though they’ll televise them to us,
like bowling tournaments or com-
mercials. The televised moon-

landing was strange. It escaped
reality somehow.’

But that strange scene is not
enough. We need a Frontier so
immediate and magnetic the earth
rocks. And there is no room for the
social explosion of the Frontier
anymore. There is nowhere left to
go, friend. '

A PSALM IN SUPPLICATIONFOR
THE BIG BANG

We need the Frontier. Not the
Madison Avenue adventure of us-

ing different deodorants on our
right and left sides, but something
massive and terrible and frighten-
ing and dangerous. Something that
could get us all killed.

Right now we are stifled under a
big, iron lid, victims of a Spiritual
‘Green-House Effect. But, the en-
ergy has to go somewhere. .

We’ll find the new Edge of the

World or suffocate ‘ in our own‘

wastes.

Maybe it'll be one Frontier,

‘maybe a million. But it better come .

soon because in the hostile sus-
picion of the suburbs and the
rat-happy cities the urge to finda
new Cliff is building.

When it happens I hope to God it
will blow this country right off its
present, well-trimmed and termin-
al track.

Maybe you and I won’t get to go, .

but somebody better.‘ _Meanwhile
entropy is, busy reducing our

well-managed civilization to dust.

I The insidious variables of econom-
ics, politics and society are nearly
out of control, and multiplying
quietly, under our beds. T

Student Organizations Shofied     4

To the editor:‘

In your February 19 issue,‘ Sarah '

Harmon of the AUE said that the
Committee on Student Organiza-
tions had not contacted her

organization either before or after-

the deadline for turning in
membership information.

I can verify her charges. This is
also true in the case of our
organization, Pitt Young Ameri-
cans for Freedom. Even though

your article stated that all groups

had been “successfully contacted”

by the committee, this is not the
truth. We never received any
notification from the committee on
when our membership information
was due in, and we were not
notiﬁed of the extension given
when the original deadline had

AUE was also not contacted, it
would appear that the non-contact
was not purely accidental. The
committee should be held respon-
sible for the failure of the 32 groups
to turn in the required information,
and should not have _taken the
entirely irresponsible action of
voting to suspend recognition,
without finding out why so many
groups had not complied. Each
organization has a mailbox, a
phone, and in our case, a message
sheet on our door. It would have
been easy for the committee to
contact us if they had tried, but
they didn’t. H

I would, at this time, like to
commend former CSO member,
Tyrone Hubbard, for being the only
member of the committee with the

large number of groups involved
merited an investigation of why
there were so many non-complying
groups. It would have been found
that the fault lay with the
committee or their communications
system, but not with the organiza-
tions. ‘

I would also like to know why the
Pitt, News, ‘without checking with
any of the organizations to see if
the facts were as reported, printed
the falsehoods it did on that day. It
is a crying shame if untruths and
innuendo must be used for you to
get enough news to print. Clifford
Irving was not a bad writer; but
that is no excuse for the Pitt News
to follow his example.

Pitt Greeks: A Place TaGaBetween    ass...  

BY WAYNE CARUTHERS
Fraternity and sorority groups,
commonly known as Greeks, may
be one of the most dynamic
organizations at Pitt.

' Greek men and women hold more
positions of leadership and respon-
f"*./,—5jbility on the campus than
1 any other student group, according
to Dina Natali, assistant director of
Student Activities and the Greek

advisor.

“The old image of Greeks as
nothing but beer drinkers is slowly
dying. The Greek appeal is now. for
a place to go to between classes,
leadership‘ experience, and ‘per-
haps a place to live.”

Natali noted the large number of
commuter students at Pitt and said
that Greeks provide a relatively
inexpensive home at the chapter
houses instead of renting an
apartment or living at the
dormitories. _

Does a student’s QPA suffer if. he
(or she) elects to join a Greek
organization? Not as a rule.
According to Natali, the all-Greek
academic average is always above
the all-student average.

The reason‘ is twofold, accordiifg '

to Natali. . A student must have a
2.0 QPA to be considered for Greek
membership, and also, one of the

ideals of the‘ fraternities and
sororities is scholarship.- _
Pitt has- 22 fraternities, all

national -groups except for one
(Triangle), and’ 14 national soror-

ities.  .

Each fraternity and sorority,
participates throughout the year in
an individual community or charity
project such as, work for Children’s
Hospital,_ School for the Blind,
Cancer Research and donationsto
charitable organizations. —

At least once a year,
collectively campaign for contribu-
tions to a particular organization.

This year’s charity‘ drive ‘began ‘

Greeks ,

 

February 3, and will beneﬁt the
Allegheny County Heart Fund.
The first step in joining a Greek
organization is the procedure
known among Greeks as rushing.
Most fraternities rush at the
beginning of the fall and winter
terms, ‘although sororities rush in
the middle of the fall term.

The process of ‘rushing was
explained by Ed Riefenstahl,
president of the Inter-fraternity
Council, and Susan B; Turner,
president of the Pan-Hellenic
Council. - ‘.— «A

“Rush is the process of meeting p

the different fraternity brothers.

Rushefunctions, suchas parties and
dances, are held to attract new
members. V As the rush period
progresses the functions become

smaller and on a more personal"

basis,” Riefenstahl said‘.

Rush is technically a trial period
where the‘individual and the Greek
fraternity or sorority appraise each
other. .If the individual likes what
he sees during the rush period and
if the Greek chapter is interested,
he may be extended a bid to go

assume a middle-ag'e identity and
think, dress, and talk it at all SCA
events.

Though mostly college students,
the local _SCA’s members are young
and old, male and female. The
current king is a physics professor
at the University of Pennsylvania.
This Barony has many medieval
identities including nobility,
peasants, sorcerers, woodsprites,
and even a leper!

You choose a person from any
nationality in the (period 900-1650
and then become that person for all
activities. You’re even supposed to
create a history about your
middle-ages identity.

Men compete in serious combat
during the SCA’s wars and crown
tournaments with padded rattan
swords to earn their titles. Twice a
year Crown Tournaments are held
when one man earns the position of
King. I

Sometimes baronies compete
against each other in wars,
potentially weekend affairs.
Tension runs high, tempers ﬂare,
and political warfare runs rampant.
NBC ﬁlmed the most recent war
last September and aired it in
January on “Weekend.”

And for the ladies (the middle

  

ages were chauvinistic!)the SCA
has many craft guilds. You can
learn almost any middle-age
talent--cooking, music, needle-
work, and poetry-writing. There is
an herb guild, a medieval
instrument-making guild, and a
caligraphy guild which teaches the
beautiful art of medieval hand-
writing.

Partiers can find a niche in the
SCA too, for feasts and merry-
making are regular happenings.
Dancing to medieval music and
drinking ale and meade (made from
fermented honey) set the mood for
the feast. Middle-ages food like

, mutton, meat pies, and tarts are

heartily consumed.

Lady Annalisee du Poicitaine, a
sharp-looking blond, is High
Chancellor of the local Barony and
is in charge of membership. She is
holding a lecture/slide presenta-
tion about the SCA on March 8 at
one pm at the Squirrel Hill branch

through an initiation period.
Although there have been incidents
of violent hazing at other fraternity
chapters across the country, there
have been no such incidents at Pitt
and indeed is prohibited by the
IFC/Pan-Hellenic by-laws. ,.

The cost of belonging to a Greek
organization may vary. The IFC
and Pan-Hellenic Council receive a
budget from the Allocations Com-
mittee of Student Government.
The remaining costs are met by
dues and other fees from the
members.-

According to Riefenstahl what can
be gained from Greek membership
depends on the type of person
applying. A fraternity can be
called a social organization or
community organization depending
on what the individual wants to get
out of it.

“People become interested in
fraternities and sororities for
different reasons.‘ As the process
of pledging continues however, one
ﬁnds newer and more meaningful
reasons for belonging,” he said;

Fraternities set up goals which

may be impossible to reach but’

give a person something to "strive
for, noted Riefenstahl.
“We’re trying to change the

traditional Greek stereotype. A lot

of the leg work for many campus

functions is done by Greeks,” said
David Dieicksen, assistant director
of fraternities and sororities.

Both men noted that the frater-
nities are trying to maintain a good
relation with residents of the
Bellefield area. There are
members of fraternities on each
street that residents can call in the
event of a complaint about a noisy
party, a’ loud band or other
disturbances.

In the event a complaint is lodged,
a hearing before the IFC Judiciary
Board will hear the arguments of

both sides and administer appro- -

priate sanctions if "the fraternity
chapter is at fault.

Greeks are also involved in
organizing affairs for- the entire

' student body such as Freshman

Fall'Weekend, Mentors Weekend
and the Orientation Committee.
Larry Gleason, a sophomore and

new member of the Sigma Chi
fraternity, discussed what being a

Greek has meant to him. ‘,‘Pitt
seemed to be a cold university
when Ifirst came here. The social
life of the fraternities impressed
Gleason noted
that although his initial reason for
joining Greeks was social, he
learned responsibility and how to
budget his time” in order to
maintain his scholastic average.
“Greeks are there for anything
the people want them for. It’s a
tool which can be used in many
different ways,” Riefenstahl said.

Second of l‘Pontqgleize" Series

BY HARRIS LEVY
When you see Pantagleize, you’ll
probablythink the set isreally
simple. And costumes are just
clothes, right?

‘“Less is more”’ said Henry

Heymann in regard to the set’s
look. But don’t let appearances fool
you. The vitally important sets,
costumes, music and lighting in-
volve a lot of creative thinking. And
a lot of -hard work by dedicated Pitt

- ‘ulty and students.

“listart with an abstract shaping
of stage space,” according to set

., designer Henry Heymann. “En-

trances and exits, not doors and
windows. What kinds of arrange-
mental levels and spaces and what
they represent.”

Pantagleize uses a single set that

is primarily gray. According to“
Heymann, the problem is how to.

keep the set interesting. “One of
the best ways is using different
textures. We’ve got clear plastic
strips that glow under the lights...
they look strange. . .cold. . .ironic. ’ ’
The plastic strip backdrop con-
asts with the warm carpeting of

I sine platform. “The platformis built

‘Ac’ '

‘of metal unistruts,” Heymann
explained. “They’re modular -
you can assemble’ them like Tin-
ker-toys.” ‘ ,

“It’s rare to have a show with a
minimum of painting. They’re all
clean surfaces--the pure gray car-
pet, the pure enamel.”

"R. ‘ single set show presents several

other challenges. “The problem is
to keep, everything consistent. An
anachronism will stick out like a
sore thumb.” Heymann added that
this, a one-set show, requires
unusually-shaped props that must
be made, not bought. For Panta-

gleize, 9 rolls of 10-by-100 foot.

plastic were used. "“The plastic
turned out nice but the _stuff tears
easily,” he commented.

kwrought iron is also a part of the

set. “Everyone here had to learn
how to weld,” said a student in the
shop, located in the Cathedral
basement. .

A recent local exhibit of Alexan-
der Calder’s artwork partially in-
spired the choice of an abstract set.
“But Calder was a jumping-off
rapidly left behind,” Heymann
pointed out. Free-form shapes
were also considered before a
design emphasizing angles was
selected. ’

“David’s (Rinear) good to work
with. He can visualize the sets from

9f}.the thumbnail sketches. ’ ’ -

5......

The loud buzzing of a saw halted

the conversation. “You ought to.

speak to Lynne...”
Lynne Hemingway and two stu-
dents were still working in the
costume shop at 8 pm. A rack of
clothing covered one wall. And
renderings of costumes for Panta-
gleize. hung on another. Plays are
written but costumes represent one
important visual aspect.

“We translate the verbal into the '

visual,” said the costume designer
as she stitched a black robe.
Hemingway said that when char-

._ ,,,f*s,1;.t\<ers walk on stage, their cos-

tumes tell a truth about them
before they speak a line. -
“David was looking to the films of

the ’20’s, in movement and style.‘

and line became very important,”
she added. According to Heming-
way, “The characters as deGhel-
derode has written them combine
archetypes and stereotypes.”
What the costumer must do is
make them clear.

Individual characters required in-
dividual solutions.

“The revolutionaries are recogni-
zable types from various periods of
history,” she said.

“Blank the poet believes his cause
is an artistic one. He has problems
coping with reality and for him the
revolution represents a tangible,
effective change...but Blank would
never be effective in this change.”

Hemingway said Blank could be a
romantic from the 1840’s or a
beatnik. “We’re not bound by
period, we’re bound by character,”
she added. Blank will appear to be
from the late ’50’s or early ’60’s.

The revolution needs a messiah.
And how do you transfer Panta- .
gleize’s vulnerable eccentric per-
sonality into a costume?

Pantagleize’s costume doesn’t
ﬁt,” Hemingway said. “The pants

snug; he’s got a collar and a tie but

not attached to a shirt.” .

A student in the shop added,
“Seeing what .\types of people are
cast in the play is also part of

 

 

 

designing.” >

And whether it’s football shoulder
pads to depersonalize 6’3” soldiers
or a greatcoat to make a character
look bigger and remind viewers of
past revolutions, the costumes
suggest and reinforce the charac-
ters’ personalities.

The music and sound effects for
Pantagleize are all on tape. Ac-
cording to the musical director,
Frank McCarty, “All kinds of
sound effects like cannons going off
had to be taped.” He added,
“There was a lot of splicing already
so ‘I decided to tape the whole
thing.” Only 9 musicians were
used but overdubbing makes it
sound like 40 or 50. ‘ —

McCarty discussed the specific
needs of Pantagleize. “My basic
job is to supply sound effects and
snatches of dialogue that relate to

‘the previous scene and point

toward the next one. The little
snatches of speech and the sound
effects become music.” .
Three sets of sound sources are
used for Pantagleize. One is the
sound of cannons and riﬂes.
Another, the voices of the actors,
is probably the ‘most important.
McCarty said, “The play at times is
so unreal, the sound track tries to
help the production along by
recapitulating little speeches and

1 Triple Reading infRevaiew

making connections,” he added.
Music is especially important in a
scene ‘involving a- crowd proces-
sion. “I started out with the idea of
marching band ensembles on the
street—the first thing that came to
mind were the 7 or 8 bands’ at
Disneyland.” '
For this scene, McCarty wrote a
series of short pieces. All the
groups play the same music dis-
guised by different arrangements.
The ensembles range from‘ organ
grinder and his monkey to a
janizary band. “In the 17th and
18th centuries, mercenaries from

_ Turkey fought in the many little

wars in Europe. And they brought
their bands--a few standard in-
struments and a heavy emphasis on
percussion. ’ ’

“A polka band became sort of a
more general German band which

' playsa waltz and gets, out of the

way for a dixieland band. Then
there’s the pit band and the shit
band— the shit band limps left,
right, left.”

McCarty also mentioned the.

A   Poetry ForumPresents Filling Meal  

I BY CAROL E.4CICCI

Till February 26; the 1975 season
of the International Poetry Forum
has been dominated by an all-male
cast. This convention was dropped
by Paul Zimmer’s introduction of
Annie Dillard. “Ms. Dillard is best
known for her prose work, but I
must say that Ithink she is a much
better poet than a prose writer.”

 

True, Ms. "Dillard is a good prose
writer. She is’; contributing editor
to ,Harper’s Magazine, a regular
columnist for the Wilderness
Society, and in 1974 _Harper’s

Magazine Press published her
prose narrative, Pilgrim at Tinker

Creek.
But her poems have appeared in

‘The American Scholar, The Atlan-
tic, Souther Poetry Review, and
The New York Quarterly. Tickets

published in ’74 by the University
of Missouri Press and will soon be
published in paperback by Bantam.
Di1lard’s poetry speaks simply of
simplicity. She laments over the
foibles of society, complaining of
the replacement of nature with
“white paint, some asphalt...
tennis courts in the clearing.” She
sings of sensitivity to life, of a blind
girl’s ﬁrst experience she writes,
“Oh, God! How beautiful!” _
Yet, though Dilard was a unique
attraction tothe poetryforum, she
was not the only attraction. She
shared center stage with two
distinguished males, Jon Anderson
and, United States Award winner,

' Thomas Rabbitt.

Anderson is a resident poet at the
University of Pittsburgh. He has
written several books including
Looking for Jonathan, National
Book Award nominee, Death and
Friends, and, the most recent, In
Sepia. A His poetry has been
published in The New Yorker,

Poetry, The Hudson Review, The‘

Iowa Review, and Poetry North-
west. .

He writes from his heart and his

own mind, contemplating life,

coming to terms with death, “I
don’t want to scare you; after death
there are two alternatives, both
heartless: memory and forgetful-
ness.” I

Anderson isn’t afraid to confront
the worst of human conditions.
Because of that, his poetry is

, honest and sweet.

Till the 1974 US Award, Thomas
Rabbit had never been published in
book form. Exile, his award
winning manuscript, was chosen
from 900 submissions and has now

been published by the,Univer_sity of

-«Pittsburgh Press_., ' '

Rabbitt’s writing is delightfully

witty, even though he deals with .

such heavy topics as sexual
jealousy and neuroses. It is ﬁlled
with strong personal and literary

illusions, surrounded with pun and "
_parody.

“I feel like a bucketful of popcorn
after champagne and caviar,”
Rabbitt explained after being the
last to step before the microphone.
He was not the popcorn but the

prime rib. The meal was delicious. H

“Music should mold a production

David Rinear asked, “Is

Dick Knowles rushed out of his" (7

Knowles designed Pantagleize’s" _

building the set. “The lighting 
designer starts last of all the “ if

and the costume designer,” he"

said.

'\ Lighting is artistically designediiiii

must also be taken into account. “If ',

also be unaware that there are;  ,—
about 50 sound cues and 50 light _ 1'7
"cues. “That’s a good ch, ,”‘ A

Knowles said, “but not really a
lot.”

For Pantagleize, Knowles

designed a lighting plan with little . .—
back lighting. “It pushes charac-' ‘
ters back for a cartoon effect,” he . .
said. Backlighting is used only for ,

the character, Pantagleize. “When

‘ult of traditions passed down

tra. Appropriately enough, his last
concert will be the ﬁnal concert of
next season, and it will feature
Beethoven's Symphony No. 9
(“Chorale”). Now, however, the
search is on for a new director.
What sort of person is being
sought?

Most likely, when the person is
selected, he will be an older man,
not an American, and it will be no
surprise if people find it hard to get
along with him. He will probably
bring with him a particular set of
biases in favor of certain types of
music, and against others. Since
he will almost surely not be an
American, it is extremely unlikely
that he will know anything--or care
anything--about American music.

In some ways, this will be a
representation of good things,
though this may not be readily
apparent, but it will mostly be the
result of bad traditions which are
expendable.

First of all, the director is going-to
Prejudices are too
strong everywhere for this to be
reversed at this time, but even if it
were possible togain consideration
for a woman, there aren’t any
qualiﬁed to handle the post. It is

 

 The Young American in Need

‘up to the smaller, minor orchestras

to serve as places of preparation for
all aspiring conductors, not just
males.

The man will be older because age
is associated with experience with
hundreds of concerts, performing
hundreds of major and minor
works. It took a while to get that
experience in the older times, but
today, there are more orchestras
than ever before, providing more
experience than ever before. A
person can be intimately familiar
with a piece even before hearing an
orchestra play it for the first time,
due to ready availability of scores,
and recordings. Today, age simply
isn’t nearly as important as it used
to be. This is why it was possible
for someone like Bernstein to come
along and take the job at the New

York Philharmonic at a rather

young age.

The new director will not be an
American simply because tradition
dictates that the director not be an
American. It may be true that the
USA has had conservatories and
orchestras superior to most in
Europe for years (it is true). But
the powers that be are more
concerned with tradition than

quality sometimes. The assump-
tions here, I guess, would be that
people. won’t take an American
director seriously, and either won’t
go to concerts, ‘or, worse still, will
stop donating money to the
Orchestra fund. Perhaps there is a
feeling that the musicians won’t
stand for an American. At any
rate, there have been almost no

serious conductors in the USA,»

aside from Bernstein, who are
American citizens. Ironically
enough, one of the leading
conductors in Europe is an
American named Dean Dixon. He
was, at the last time I checked,
conductor of the South-West
German Radio Orchestra. He also
conducts\in Australia.

Alright, now why on earth did I
say he’d be hard'to get along with?
Simple. The old school. conductor
takes his dictatorial powers very
seriously. ‘Hehas no conception of
courtesy or consideration of the
thousands of people he must deal
with‘who haven’t a fraction of the
musical understanding he has.
Insecure in an American environ-
ment, he may tend to lean even
harder on his total authority. This
is true of the most popular directors
of “the old school.” — -Name a major
conductor, and ' that person will
have numerous stories of how they

‘ screwed some person or persons.
The best sources of these _stories ,
.are the musicians and, of course,

other conductors.

Okay, I realize that this is a waste
of time, but here goes: The best
sort of director to search for will be
the younger American. He will be
able to lead the orchestra in a less
tense manner, sacriﬁcing only a
minimal amount of rigor in terms of

the demands he will make on the-
orchestra, compared to the old

school director, and gaining a new

feeling of freedom and spontaneity.

As a ‘younger man, he will be

flexible, compared to an older man,

and as an American, he will have a

better understanding of the Ameri-

can musical idiom.

It is a shame that we will have to
put up with an older foreign-born
person, but that’s still where the
money is...

Let me make it clear that this is

not a criticism of Doctor Steinberg.-" ‘$3, :3‘

He was, and is, a superb director. -
It is unlikely that we can get a man
equal to his skill. At the time he
became our director, however,
times were different. Obviously I
have not meant" to imply that
persons from outside the USA
aren’t competent--they simply
don’t have the experience of being
a person raised in‘ the USA,
surrounded by US music, and
therefore understanding it better.

(Continued from Page,7)

Knowles handles the inevitable
problems with a sense of humor. “I
promised to write upside down' '
until the dimmer was ﬁxed,” he
said‘ pointing to an inverted mes-
sage scrawled on a blackboard.

When Pantagleize is performed,
the contributions of the actors will
be. the most obvious. But theatre- .
goers will miss a lot if they ignore
the work of the production staff’s
faculty and students.

Seven on ﬁve does _not make for a
very even basketball game as the
Panthers found out Wednesday
night in the Kent State “Pit.” The
Golden Flashes got some valuable
assistance from Middle-American
Conference officials Tom Ballaban
and Bob Wortman to hand the Cats
their ninth loss of season, 69-68. '

But the escaped convicts in the
striped shirts can’t take all the
blame for the Cats’ disappointing

because the Pitt squad didn’t play

' with much authority, especially in

the first half when they committed
ten turnovers and shot a dismal 39
per cent from the ﬁeld.

However, in the second half the '

‘Cats were able to improve their
shooting, although they weren’t
able to cut down on their turnovers,

deficit of 43-34. They were able to
cut the lead to two points on several
occasions only to watch the Flashes
run their lead back to ten. '

enough to overtake the “Golden

 pleased Pitt football coach Johnny Majors today revealed the

{results of his 1975 recruiting campaign, calling it the “best over all

quality group since I’ve-been here.” A .

In announcing that 29 high school athletes has signed national
letters-of-intent to attend Pitt this fall, Majors emphasized that 17 of
the 29 of the players are from Pennsylvania and 14 of these from
Western Pa. In addition, 22 of the athletes live within a four-hour drive
of the Pitt campus, and none are from junior colleges.

“Pm just very pleased with the over all quality of this group,” Majors
noted. . “I’m particularly delighted with the response in the State and

.E‘i“,‘4,ar,ticularly in Western Pennsylvania. The interest in Pitt football is

_ Mayne Adams

high and we appreciate the support we received in the area during the
recruiting season.” ‘ ‘

A preliminary breakdown by positions shows that the emphasis was
on linemen. In fact, 13 of the incoming ‘freshmen weigh 230 pounds or
more. The breakdown shows: linemen 15, quarterbacks and offensive
backs 6, linebackers 3, defensive backs 2, and receivers 3.

Majors is quick to caution Pitt fans, however, “Although I’m pleased

’ with the recruiting, we won’t really know the true results until the

players perform over the next four years.”
The ﬁrst group of recruits announced by Majors is:

Charly Hagins

  Dedicated I-Iockey Man

BY CONNIE GIEL

Hockey players, the serious kind,
shrug off suggestions that hockey
isn’t everything, that ice isn’t a
natural human environment, or
that shoes are more normal than
skates. Pitt Hockey captain Charly
Hagins is the serious kind. M

“Hockey is constantly on my
mind. At least half of every day is
spent thinking about hockey or
actually playing. I know it’s time-
consuming, but I don’t consider it
time wasted,” Hagins says.

Hagins has planned his life
around hockey--from high school to
college to career. “lid be lying if I
didn’t say I wanted something big
in hockey. Sure, I face reality, there
are a lot of better players, but I’m.
still looking into something.”

The search began in junior league
hockey, when Hagins joined the

‘ Johnstown entry in the Western

Penn league. “I played all posi-
tions except goal, trying to find
what was right for me. I started in

0 defense, then moved to a wing

position. In juvenile hockey at that
time, there was a tendency for the
best players, the strong men, to
play center. I didn’t consider it
until theitrainer of the (Johnstown)
Jets started watching me. He gave
me tips on face-offs and skating.
Finally I got good enough to move

_ up to center.”

While skating in the Johnstown

junior leagues, Hagins tried to‘

make hockey a total experience. “I

I ‘ did every job in the War Memorial

[the Jets’ home arena]— from stick
boy to assistant trainer. I just kept

. trying new things. My first taste of

professionalism came with all that.

. Going on the road, skating’ with the
" guys, everything just inspired me

to keep it up.”

Two years of playing hockey at
Pitt’s’Johnstown campus was, for
Hagins,- relative stagnation. “I
played juniors till I was 18, the age
limit. I didn’t want to stay off the
ice too long, so some of the guys in
the same situation formed a senior
league with me. We played most of
the colleges in the area, which gave
me a feel for college hockey.

“I transferred_ last year to the

,~«‘-.a.-

main campus, because the coach
let me know I’d have a place here. I
had originally applied to Lehigh,
but they told me you had to first be
a student before you could even try
out for ' the team. I figured I
wouldn’t be getting much hockey

out of that place, so I decided on

Pitt.” .

Last year Hagins was an all-Star
selection with ’32 goals and 45
assists. Named an alternate captain
to the Pitt team, Hagins formed the
first forward line with his current
wingers Rick Vernon and Denny
Browne. ' ~ .

“Our role "as a line‘ is a lot
different now from last year. If our
line didn’t score, the team didn’t
win. This year we’ve become more
solid in our first, second and third
lines. The whole team is more
dependable. '

‘ ‘We play a lot differently than the

other lines. ‘Ricky is the good shot‘

and powerful skater. Browne is the
strongest in corners and along the
boards. No one can touch him
there. And_'me, I win face-offs and
make the plays. We all have
different qualities.

“The second line is well-bal-
anced, with a good passing attack.
They’re 1-2-3 in a row in scoring.
Any one of those guys can shoot
and score, whereas our line com-
plements each other.” A g

Fourth in Pitt scoring in league
and total play, Hagins has the most
penalty minutes. His overall 12
goals and 19 assists are over-sha-

.dowed by the looming 64 PIM

2 ﬁgure. The record reflects his view

of a captain's position.

“Thelcaptin is the strong man on
the ice. He’s also the mediator
between the team and the coach. I
have to be patient and think of
everybody’s problems in their own
terms. But sometimes it's hard to
get everyone to settle" down and
play hockey.” He could have
added, “even for myself.”

Several of Pitt’s high scorers, plus
their starting goaltender, will
graduate this year. “But I don’t
think we’re going to have any
trouble. I had anticipated, due to
the loss of seniors last year, a weak

team this year. But things shaped
up pretty well.‘l’m impressed with
the freshman talent on the team
now. And Pitt is the drawing card
for Pittsburgh players--they’ll go to

Pitt before they go anywhere els-e#'_<~.‘.-‘_v

to play college hockey.” e
Hagins’ evaluation of next year’s
prospective team is about the same
as any fan’s. “We have two solid
lines and good goaltending. Paul
Huger will return, and we’ve got a
really good prospect from Chur-
_ chill. And Vernon will be back.”
,Pitt will go independent next year,
with a new schedule and a lot of
problems. “The -competition is
within Pitt’s range. I think we’re
bound to lose a few games,
probably on the road, but the guys
should be able to handle it.”
Hagins explained the. move from

‘the WPIHA. “The league was aﬁw

great prototype, it really was. It’s’ 

just too bad they didn’t have a staff

I to get things going and keep them

in action. After a while, the league
just wasn’t any good for us. We’
had to get out.”

As any devoted hockey player
should do, Hagins puts the team
first. But he’s worried about post-
graduation plans. .He’s an econ-
omics major, in keeping with his
dual hockey approach. Hard-nosed
yet romantic about the sport,
Hagins hopes to “someday own an
arena. Just to work with high
school hockey or ice skating.’ It’s
really something I’ve always want-
ed to do.” . ' 5‘

Hagins may yet come full-circle.
High school to college to career to
high school. Serious hockey. players
seem to make way for themselves
in the game which for them is life.

Army In Fnncll Meet

Standout performances were
turned in by Ron Pasterick and Don
Stevenson, numbers three and ﬁve
in the east, respectively ﬁnishing
first and second in the all-around
competition.

Gaining their second win in a row
may not be too difficult. Army,
with a 3-3 record is seventh in a
nine team conference, only two
places ahead of the Panthers. The

«ifact that_the Cadets defeated the
Cats in the losers’ home gym last
year adds to Pitt’s incentive.

Looking past tomorrow’s en-
counter, the, gymnasts are pointing
toward the eastern championships
two weeks hence.

“We aren’t taking a full team,”
said Perez, “for both ﬁnancial and
practical reasons. We are trying to
place individuals into the nationals,
not the whole team.”

BY JIM SPANOS

The regular season for the Pitt
wrestlers ended gloriously with an
upset win over Penn State, but
tonight their thoughts will be on
more important matters. The sight
is the US Naval Academy, and the
event is the annual , Eastern

Intercollegiate Wrestling Associa-

tion tournament.

Coach Dave Adams will be

’ watching ‘anxiously as his 8-48 squad

competes against other wrestlers
from the east in a prelude to the
Nationals in two weeks at Prince-
ton, N.J. Adams has tentatively set
his squad: Kevin Nellis (118),
George Bryant (126), Rande
Stottlemyer (134), Bill Korth (142),
Skip Bolin (150), John Chatman
(158), George 0’Kom or Dan
Levine (167), Craig Evans (177),
Bill Bailey (190), and Carl Roba
(Heavyweight).

Rande Stottlemyer, a sophomore

who ﬁnished third in the EIWA’s.

last year, has compiled a brilliant
9-0 record this season. Stottle-
myer, a graduate of Hickory- High
School, ﬁnished sixth in the
Nationals last year en route to

achieving all-American status.

“Rande is a super person to have
on our team,” notes Adams.
“But,” he continues, “last year he
was injured in the semi-ﬁnals at
Iowa State and had to default the
remaining two matches. I’m sure
that one of his goals this year is to
go farther and win ‘a national
championship.”

Freshman superstar Kevin Nellis,
a 118 pounder from Shaler High
School, is 9-2-1 this year, and the
Eastems will be his biggest
challenge of the year. *

“His fundamentals are sound,”
Adams says of Nellis, “and he’s
especially good at escaping from
the bottom position. He's a
tenacious rider and I_(evin just
keeps his opponents off-balance--
an outstanding freshman.”

Bryant, a 126 pound senior, won
the 118 pound class last year at the
Eastern, and then went on to ﬁnish
ﬁfth at the/nationals, also gaining a
spot on the all-American team.

,“Both George and Rande (Stottle-
myer) have similar styles,” says
Adams. “They both have had a lot
of freestyle experience‘ and prefer

to wrestle on their feet, and ‘look for
takedowns.”

The victory against the Nittany
Lions was as good a conclusion to
dual meet competition as any, and
Adams said, “Our physical condi-
tioning is good and our skills
appeared very sound against Penn
State. We were aggressive and I
feel we can wrestle that way this
weekend.”

So do the Pitt wrestlers.
