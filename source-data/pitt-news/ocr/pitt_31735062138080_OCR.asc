Leslie Wilkins

(31-IAIRMAN OF CPSF, president of

Delta Tau Delta, and now one of
two officers of the National Interfra-
ternity Council. ‘Nilkins’ election in
New York places the University in
the national Greek limelight.

Wilkins Chosen
National Ofﬁcer

University Fraternity. Delegate
Named At Convention

The University ﬁgured prominently
in the sessions of the National Inter-
fraternity Council convention in New
York over the Weekend when Leslie
Wilkins, University delegate, was
elected assistant chairman and secre-
tary-treasurer of the national organi-
zation.

At the convention were delegates
from every state in the Union, with
about 100 men present. In conjunc-
{ion with this convention was the na-
tional interfraternity conference, at-

tended by faculty advisers and frater-

nity alumni,

The keynote of the combined con-
ference and convention was the in-
creasingly evident dilemma of the
college fraternity since the first days
of depression and undergraduate
economic troubles. The prevalent
wave of anti-fraternity sentiment, the
declining standards of fraternity
scholarship, and the relationships be-
tween fraternities and administrations
were among the problems discussed.

With Wilkins as one of only two
officers of the national organization,
the University will become the head-
quarters for the dissemination of all
information concerning the group to
its member schools. ‘Wilkins will
serve as holder of the combined three
ofﬁces until the next convention in
the fall of 1935."

During sessions of the undergradu-
ate group, Wilkins was called upon to

, discuss angles of the fraternity situa-

tion here, The cooperative- buying as-
sociation, the rushing. program, the"
yeaiuy conference, and other features
of the Pitt set-1p were inquired into
by other delegates.

Vvilkins, president of the University
chapter of Delta Tau Delta national
fraternity, is also chairman of the
newly formed Council of Presidents
of Social Fraternities. He is a mem-
ber of the varsity football team and of
the University Assembly.

N. Robert Seidle, assistant to the
dean of men, also attended the ses-
sions in New York, and spoke to the
group of advisers and alumni on the
University’s- unusual cooperative buy-
ing association for fraternities.

It will be the duties of Vvilkins, with
the aid of Mr, Se=idle, to prepare min-
utes of the past meeting, and to dis-
tribute all releases of the organization.

University Contract Bridge Cluh

Scouting For Novices Or Experts

 

Are you an expert in the intricacies
of contract bridge?

VS/'el.l, then, do you play at contract
bridge‘?

‘Nitli its keynote “You don’t have to
be good, for you'll meet plenty
worse,” the University contract bridge

geners,l meeting will take place to
which all club candidates are invited.

The rooms of the Schenley Bridge
club in the Hotel Schenley have been
offered for use of the club by Mr. and

anything as subject matter for her
daily column, she also conducts a sec-

tion in the Press devoted to critical
comments on currentmovies.

No information was: released by
Mrs. Parry on the turn’ her discussion
will take, but it is probable that she
will follow up previous phases of her
column on the current trend toward

“decent” movies,

Marlatt May Be .
Unable To Direct
Cap, Gown Show

iCap and Gown may be withoilt Di-
rector Marlatt this April, VVi1li-am
Marlatt, who directed the past ﬁve
Cap and Gown productions, expressed
his doubts as to whether he will be
able to take the engagement, in a let-
ter Monday to Theodore W. Biddle,
assistant dean of men. An already
busy engagement schedule for the
spring may interfere with Mr. Mar-
1at.t’s accepting the directorship of
Cap and Gown.

Marlatt has directed the Cap and
Gown productions since 1930 when he
first came here from New York to
stage “Manhattan Preferred,” still re-
membered as a “hit” show.

"1 he Graduate club of Cap and Gown
will meet tonight in the Faculty club
room of the Hotel Schenley at 8
o'clock to decide deﬁnitely on a direc-
tor.

,ing played for the fall

The contract bridge club was
founded here last year. From its
membc-rsliip a team was drawn which
included Seder, Josephine Pollack,
C34, Jane Mitchell, C34, and Franklin
1-Iockensnlith, BA36.

After today’s meeting, the club will
meet every Wednesday. From 1:30 to
2:30 o'clock each meeting, rubber
bridge will be played and beginning
at 2:30 o'clock, there will be duplicate
games.

Tentative plans, according to Seder,
include intercollegiate matches and
mass tournaments between student
and faculty members. For the inter-
collegiate matches, elimination tourna-
ments will be conducted to determine
the best student bridge talent. ,

Perhaps the paramount aspect of
the organization, says Seder, is the
fact that there will be absolute-ly no
fees of any sort levied,

VVilliam S. Maulsby, head of the de-
partment of journalism, and Dr. J. S.
Taylor, head of the department of
mathematics, will sponsor the club.

Latest Pittsburgh Business Review
Cites Higher Average Cost Of Living

 

The cost of living has averaged
somewhat higher this year than last.
Consequently, the increase in pur-
chasing power of workers in the dis-
trict is somewhat less than the per-
centage increase in payrolls indicates,
In this way “Pittsburgh Business Re-
view,” a monthly summary of busi-
ness andeconomic conditions in the
Pittsburgh district by the Bureau of
Business Research of the University,
characterizes the economic situation
of the past month.

Retail prices of ﬂood in Pittsburgh
and in the whole country averaged
less in October than in the preceding

month, the index for the United States
decreasing slightly more than that for
the Pittsburgh district. Because of
lower prices, the cost of living in the
country declined in October against
September, but was 3.7 per cent higher
than in October, 1933, and 6.3 per
cent higher than in October, 1932.
Employment in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict declined a little more in October.
There. were 0.6 per cent fewer work-
ers employed in October than in Sep-
tember, However, combined payrolls
of all ﬁrms in the district were 8.1
per cent larger in October than in the
preceding month, and 12.7 per cent
more than October of last year.

“ Ve cannot bring nobility to busi-

W. Autos, dean of women, at the Trin-
ity cathedral Sunday night. Miss
Amos took the place of the regular
minister, Dean High Moor, in giving
the sermon for the evening. She is
the third woman ever to have spoken
from the pulpit of the cathedral.

The text of her speech was “What
is your genealogy?” An interest in
the lineage of races and families leads
to an interest in the lineage of indi-
viduuls, Miss Amos stated. “Every
man should strive to ennoble himself
to the standards of all the great who
have gone before him, for part of
every man’s inheritance is the work
and beneﬁts of those who have pre-
ceded him.”

A New Career

0 STUDENTS of tlie Univer-

sity the most interesting
speech of the recent Municipal
conference was made by Civil
Service Commissioner Leonard D.
\Vhite, who foresees a new career
for university-trained persons in
an enlarged United States Civil
Service.

Says Commissioner VVhite:

“The key to the public service
of the future in this country is to
establish in it the foundations of
a career that will be attractive to
the strongest and most intelligent
young men and women of each
generation. ”

The day has gone by, in the

judgment of the Coinmissioner,
when the United States can rely
for increased man power in ex-
panded governmental functions
on dollar-a.-year men—as we did
in l917—or on college professors
 we are doing.
THE COMMISSIONER suggests
' instead the recruitment of
graduates from colleges a.nd uni-
versities, much as the Standard
Oil companies were accustomed to
do in the ’twenties. Candidates
would not be required to present
speciﬁc training in detailed sub-
jects, such as the chemistry of
soils or the history of the party
system in the United States.

But broad general education
would be emphasized. Persons
who passed competitive general
selection tests would receive sup-
plementary training by the gov-
ermncnt, and would enter a. serv-
ice offering free opportunity for
advancement on merit.

The devaluation that has oc-
curred in business careers since
1929 will imake‘ students more
likely to welcome government
service as a career. The idea of
amassing property, as an ambi-
tion. is giving way to the idea of
working at proble1ns—in science,
social welfare. art, government.

Students expecting to occupy
themselves with the work of. the
world will be interested in watch-
ing the development of Co1nmis-
sioner White’s plan.

_ Whatever other championships

conjecture of

These persons pretty
well agree, however, that Pitt
would have beaten any other
Eastern team on any afternoon
during the season. This is usu-
ally called “the Eastern cham-
pionship. ’ ’

That there will be no more
games for the purpose of estab-
lishing this opinion is not very re-
grettable. Students are complete-
ly satisﬁed with the play of Suth-
erla.nd,’s _team, and there is no
particular enthusiasm for a post-
season game.

The Panthers carried through-
out a. difficult schedule the con-
sistent enthusiasm of the stu-
dents, an enthusiasm that felt a
stir in the blood when the inter-
ference rolled down a line of

that now says with all pride,

Post Graduates

HE BLACK caps and gowns

worn by graduates at com-
incncement have an irony of their
own, according to the current
moving picture, “Gentlemen Are
Born.”

The picture attempts to answer
the question of what happens to
young men who are just out of
college with nothing but ambition
and self-conﬁdence. It ﬁnds a
pretty macabre ratio of tragedy.

The story takes four young
men, chums during college, and
follows them in their respective
assaults on architecture, journal-
ism, coaching and business. Only
one, the youth with wealthy pa-

rents, ﬁnds a position. The other

Fraternity “Crisis”
NATIONAL COLLEGE frater-

nities and their individual
chapters are facing their greatest
crisis in a generation because in
a time of depression the serious-
minded students are wondering
whether the fraternity is worth
while and justifies its expense,
delegates to the National Inter-
fraternity Conference in New
York were told last week.

Alvan E. Duerr, past chairman
of the conference, reported that
fraternity scholarship had lost
ground seriously and that, where-
as the survey for 1932-33 showed
the average of all fraternities at
a majority of colleges above the
all-men’s average, it had fallen
below the all-mcn’s average in
1933-34.

A report that urged mergers
among campus chapters was re-
ceived with mixed sentiments, on
the whole 1n1l’.avorable to this
method of solving difficulties.

Other speakers reported that
from -1 to 20 per cent of under-
graduates are currently delin-
quent in paying their fraternity
accounts, and urged that univer-
sity authorities take action to
deny graduation to fraternity
members not in good standing.

The best thing to come out of
the convention was unquestion-
ably the ncwly-organized council
to survey fraternity problems
nationally and suggest solutions.
A delegate from the University
CPSI4‘, Leslie \Vilkins, president
of Delta Tau Delta, was elected
assistant chairman and secretary-
treasurer of the group conducting
the survey. The University will
take special interest in solutions
which are suggested.

A ‘Fruits Of Enlightenment’
Tolstoy’s Bitterest

Satire—Maurer

 

By Herrymon Maurer
THE LONDON MERCURY (May 1921) Bernard Shaw says of

N
I Tolstoy: “Tolstoy is a tragi-co
a better term.

touch when he wants to destroy . . .

is the ﬁrst of the Heartbreak House

median, pending the invention of

Of all the dramatic poets he has the most withering

His Fruits of Enlightenment . . .
s and the most blightino*.” Again

in the preface to his own Heartbreak House he writes: “Tolstoy did
not waste any sympatliy on it; he was not disposed to leave the

house standing if he could bring it¢
down about the ears of its pretty and
amiable voluptuaries.” In writing of
another of Tolsto_v’s plays he express-
es the same criticism in a. paraphrase
of an old Christmas carol, “It is a case
of ‘God damn you, merry gentlemen,
let all things you dismay.’ ”

Shaw‘s remarks ﬁt_ ’l‘olstoy’s play
lashes out with even more. force than
Shaw’s. Nobody is spared. One per-
son may be a dog-fancier, another may
be devoted to science, another to medi-
cine. They may all be engrossed in
{he fad of the day, s~p-iritualism.
Tolstoy relentlessly explores them all
and shouts their vacuity, their duper-
stitions, their smugness to the winds.

The plot is simple, A delegation
from a peasant community has come
to buy land on installments. The
owner is persuaded to sell by the
order of a spirit during a Seance. The
spirit is manipulated by Tanya, a
serving girl, who not only under-
stands the needs of the peasants, but
is also hoping to marry a son of one
of the delegation,

'l‘1olstoy’s treatment of the house is
different from that of
Shaw. Shaw achieves the effect of
heartbreak through insane sophisti-
cated dialogue, dialogue hardly real,
but nonetheless effective. Everything
in Fruits of Enlightenment is real.
The people talk as we expect people
to talk; they act as we expect them
to act_ The house is a normal house;
the entrance hall is an entrance hall.
There are no characters, no locations
used with Shavian symbolism. There
is no quotable repartee; there are no
epigrams. The thing is of life. The
silliness and softness of real persons
in a real place are ridiculed, and the
house and the persons in it are de-
molished.

To a large extent the work of de-
struction is effected by the introduc-
tion -of the peasant delegation, The
three peasants stand like pillars of
good sense and naturalness, while
ﬂimsy conceited persons rave about
the newest fad. The peasants are not
idealized. They try to be self—eft‘acing

Dr. Carlson’s Clinic To Attract
Large Number of District
Coaches Here Saturday

 

Sending his squad through light
workouts, consisting mostly of shoot-
ing pr:-tctice, Coach Carlson and his
varsity basketball team are marking
time before their opening game of
the season this coming Saturday eve-
ning against the Bucknell ﬁve at the
stadium,

In the time remaining before the
game, Dr. Carlson plans to rest his
boys today, with tapering off drills
Thursday and Friday, and another
short rest before Saturday night. The
squad is in excellent physical condi-
tion, but Dr. Carlson is still not com-
pletely satisﬁed with the playing of
his team thus far during the practice
sessions.

During the Thanksgiving holidays,
the varsity defeated the Akron Good-
year team, 34-33, in a game meant to
smooth out the Panthers’ ﬂoor work.
After the game, Dr. Carlson was
slightly more satisﬁed with the var-
sity’s play, especially in the work of
the second team.

The Panthers lined up as they have
in the past few weeks drills, with
Skippy Hughes and Claire Cribbs at
forwards, Pete Noon at center, and
Ted Roderick and Ross Emerick at
the guard positions. Unless Coach
Ltarlson decides upon a change at the
last minute, the same players will
start the game against Bucknell.

One of the features of the practice
game against the Akron amateur team
was the appearance of the Panther
players in their new uniforms. The
suits are of a golden color, with the
letters and numerals a dark blue_ The
sweat suits are also gold with blue
letters, with a tuck-in zipper jersey.

The Pitt-Bucknell basketball game
will come as a climax to Dr. Carlson’s
ﬁfth annual basketball clinic, that
will be held Saturday at the stadium.
’l‘l1e clinic is scheduled to begin at
9:00 o'clock and continue throughout
the day and evening until the varsity
game. Replies to the invitations sent
out by Dr, Carlson the ﬁrst of this
week have shown great interest in the
clinic_ Collegiate coaches, high school
coaches, officials, and players from the
district and neighboring states will be
among those attending. The Carne-
gie Tech and Duquesne varsity bas-
ketball squads will do the demonstrat-
ing of Dr. Carlson’s intricate system.

The program during the day will
include the explanation of ,“An Offen-
sive System” and “Correct Shooting”
by Dr. Carlson, “Changes in Rules” by
M_ R. Glover, commissioner of offici-
als, and “Correlation of Physical Ed-
ucation—Student Health Program” by
Dr. George Kowallis, assistant varsity
basketball coach. In the evening, a
dinner will be served at the Webster
Hall hotel for the guests, who will
then adjourn to the stadium for the
Varsity-Bucknell battle,

Pitt Beats Tech,
Takes City Title
In Listless Game

 

 

Weinstock Scores Twice, Kicks
Two Extra Points In Final
Collegiate Performance

 

While on their way out of the sta-
dium on Thanksgiving afternoon, peo-
ple paused for a few seconds to watch
Nicksick toss a latera.l pass to Wein-
stock and Weinstock send it along to
Ormiston, the three moving along
about 36 yards on the play. The ac-
tion brought forth the remark to the
effect that hp hum, basketball season
will be here in a week.

This made about the only interest-
ing feature of the annual clash be-
tween Pitt and Tech as the Panthers
won a listless ball game on a very
drowsy afternoon. The score counted
up to 20-0.

The game was as good as over after
the ﬁrst nine minutes, the time re-
quired for Weinstock to crowd
through an eager Tech ﬂorward wall
gathered on the very goal line to stop-
him. The ﬁrst counter might have
been longer in coming had not Nick-
sick scooped up Spisak’s fumble on
the Tech 23-yard line.

Weinstock Gets Another

Tech added more cheer to the Pitt
Thanksgiving when little Stevie
Terebus forgot to take the ball along
on an end sweep and Doc Hartwig re-
covered for Pitt on the three-yard
marker_ Vveinstock got it over in two
tries. Izzy also added the second
point after touchdown. He was kick-
ing them over the cross bar with
monotonous regularity.

Pitt's ﬁnal touchdown was actually
the only earned touchdown of the ball
game. Shedlosky returned one of
Mihm’s hefty kicks to Tech’s 41 and
then moved the ball up to the 12.
Here Hub Randour tore out around
right end and ran as if a waiter were
standing right there in the end zone
with a plate of white meat in his
hands, »

Thus ended the gridiron actions of
nine of Pitt's 1934 ﬁrst string team
and put the city title once more in
the Panther bag.

Panther Seconds Suffer 18-7 Loss
At Navy In Holiday Game

 

 

While the Pitt varsity team was
having things its way in Pittsburgh
last Thursday, the Panther “B" eleven
found the Naval Academy “B” squad
with too many big guns and went
down to an 18-7 defeat at Annapolis.

Playing in a driving rain, the Mid-
dies opened the scoring with a touch-
down in the ﬁrst period climaxing an
80-yard drive. The Panthers came
right back in the second quarteriwith
Art Ruff going over for a touchdown
to give the Panthers a 7-6 lead at the
half.

Navy put the game on ice in the
third period by pushing over two six-
pointers giving them an 18-7 advan-
tage, Ward, halfback for the Middies,
featured the drives for these scores
by turning in several long runs. The
Panthers had an opportunity to add
to their total in this period when

Uram recovered a Navy fumble 011 the
enemy’s 10-yard line but lost the
chance when one of the backs fum-
bled the slippery oval.

Vvard led the Navy scorers by carry-
ing the ball across for two touch-
downs, Fleming, a lineman, getting
the other tally for the Middies.

Indoor Sports Come To Front
As Panther Football Team
Hangs Up Moleskins

 

VVith the curtain deﬁnitely drawn
on the Panther football season, three
indoor sports, boxing, wrestling, and
basketball will bask in the spotlight
during the next few months.

The wrestlers and boxers assem-
bled for their ﬁrst practice of the sea-
son Monday afternoon in the stadium
dressing room_

For both squads large and promis-
ing groups turned out. Approximately
30 candidates reported to Jack
Schricker, coach of the boxing team.
Even with the large squad Schricker
believes that there will be a dearth of
material forall weight divisions above
the 145—pound class. Coach Schricker
has only two seasoned performers to
form the foundation of his team, the
captain, Jimmie Giannatti and Joe
KOIJD. The new men and the mem-
bers of last year’s- freshman team are
expected to round out the team.

Oster Meets Wrestlers

Earl Oster, coach of the wrestling
team, met with the candidates for the
wrestling team for the ﬁrst time Mon-
day afternoon_ Although «only 20 men
were present at the ﬁrst meeting at
least that many more are expected to
report before the week is up.

All students, interested in trying out
for either the varsity or freshman
teams are requested to report to the
stadium dressing room any afternoon

this week between 3 and 4 o'clock.

Regular team practice will start

every day at 3 o’clock.
Boxing team candidates will work

out every day in the st.adium between

Delts Battle SAE
For Title In Frat
Touch Football

Delta Tau Delta was to meet Sigma
Alpha Epsilon yesterday afternoon in
the ﬁnal game of the interfraternity
touch football tournament.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon advanced to
the ﬁnal round by defeating Phi Delta
Theta in a 6-0 game early last week.

In a game played last Wednesday,

Delta Tau Delta made its way into the
ﬁnals by winning a close victory in
their fray with Pi Kappa Alpha by the
very slim margin of two ﬁrst downs.
Long, high punts by Teats of Pi
KaDDa Alpha and Housel of the Delts
featured the play during the ﬁrst half,
Penalties checked the offensive drives
of both teams throughout this period.
After Davis had passed to Willison
and Duff late in the second quarter to
chalk up two first downs for Delta
Tau Delta, the Pi K A offensive came
to life, .
It took just two minutes of the third
quarter for Truesch to grab two suc-
cessive passes from Teats and score a
Pi K A touchdown. Te-at’s attempted
drop-kick for the extra point was
blocked by a strong Delt line.

In the ﬁnal period, the Delts, trail-
ing 6-0, staged a desperate rally to pull
the ball game out of the ﬁre. After
two incomplete passes in enemy ter-
ritory, Duff scored for the Delts on
VVillison’s pass in the end zone.

The game ended one minute and 30
seconds later.

lDragons, Laughing For Dogs To Greet
Visitors in Replica Of Peiping Temple

“The Chinese Memorial room, when
completed, will be a replica of a
room in a temple near Peiping,” com-
mented Jan Porel, artist and architect
of New York, who is completing the
technical arrangeinents for the room
in the Cathedral.

The toning of the special lighting
effect, the teakwood furniture and
floor, are all designed to emphasize
the character of a traditional Chinese
room,

On the large stone rubbing of the
portrait of Confucius are Chinese
symbols which, when translated,
3, mean: Read the works of the sages,
iexpress them through iioble deeds.”

The ceiling, which is composed of
40 squares of dark and bright blue
and gold leaf, touched with red and
green, is symbolic of man’s associa-
tion with divinity. Dragons, peonies,
and the phoenix, representing wisdom,
the most beautiful birds, and the
richest ﬂowers, decorate the squares.
Eight Chinese virtues, which repre-
sent right-living principles, are en-
scrolled on eight squares: ﬁlial piety,
brotherhood, faithfulness, sincerity,
courtesy, integrity, service, and mod-
esty.

In the center of the ceiling, as a
light, is a dragon, with a pearl of
knowledge in his mouth. This repre-
sents China surrounded by the ele-
ments, which symbolize the energy
and freedom of nature: earth, clouds,
air and ﬁre_

The dragon is mounted on a circle,
which is embedded in a large square;
at the corners of the square are tri-

angles on which spring, summer,
autumn, and winter are represented
with Chinese characters.

The triangles symbolize spring, rep-
resented by a peucli ﬂower, suinnier by
the lotus, autumn by the clirysantlie-
mum, and winter by the pine, plum
and bamboo, have also short lines of
appropriate verse accompanying them.

The ceiling is upheld by red lac-
quered columns, and the walls are to
be joined to the ceiling by corbels,
carved with a. leaf design and so sym-
bolical of China that the origin has
been lost.

The red-lacquered door, studded
with brass nails, and framed with
carved sandstone, represents good
luck and prosperity. long life and hap-
pinesss, mid “Humbleness of heart,
solidity of virtue.”

As a. visitor will enter the com-

pleted room, statues of two laughing
Fu dogs will greet him.

Samuel Fung, a graduate student in
the English department, is secretary
of the China Memorial room commit-
tee.

Cap, Gown Scenarists
Fail To Produce
Manuscripts

Disappointinent has been voiced by
M,:’arsliall Baker, BA35, president of
the Cap and Gown Un(1ei'gi‘aduate
club, in the evident disinterest shown
by students in the support of Cap and
Gown as a. student activity.

The Cap and Gown Undergraduate
club has set December 15 as the dead-
line for student subinittances As yet,
there have been no books ol'l’ei-ed for
consideration.

According to Baker, it has been the
aim of Cap and Gown to make the ac-
tivity entirely undergraduate, instead
of a combined graduate-studeiit inter-
est group.

The theme of the forthcoming show,
which will be staged in April, will re-
vert to the idea of a central plot and
the elaboration of that idea into a
musical. comedy rather than the re-
vue type «of show as was last year’s
“Hello Again.”

Etinued until the first Friday in April,
