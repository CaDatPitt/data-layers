For Best Unit Lining Award

Hawthorne Declared ‘Eligible’
At Men’s Dorm Council Meet

By AL JANEZIC

Whether Hawthorne House should be declared ineligible
for the Best Unit Living Award was one of the questions
discussed at Monday evening’s dinner-meeting of Men’s Dorm
Council.

The problem arose when President Pete Bijur asked for
a discussion of‘ complaints brought to his attention about
Hawthorne House being subsidized?

by the Dean of Men’s Oflice. Bijur
said that the house _was given
money to ﬁnance activities (the

, other dorms were not), and asked
if the members of MDC thought

Hawthorne should be considered
eligible for the living award,
which is based‘ on a point system

for number and ‘type of activities. .

Assistant Director of Men's
Housing John Bender pointed out
that the situation is a result of an
experiment with a select dorm
housingpunit. He said that he did
not believe that Hawthorne House
should be penalized and declared
ineligible and was ‘backed by the
general consensus ~ of Council
members- Hawthorne, therefore,
will be eligible for the award, but

the problem of subsidizing a select V.

group in the future _is as yet 1111-
resolved. _

Affiliate-Institution
In Ecuador Closed
By Official Decree

By PAT POLLINO

Central University, the University’s affiliate-institution‘ in Ecua-
dor, remains closed by government decree, but indications point to a
reactivation of institutional processes very shortly.

Having returned from a nine-day visit to Ecuador, Chancellor
Litchﬁeld and his assistant, Dr. Alan C. Rankin, reported that talks
with leaders of the ruling military junta there have helped in ironing
out’ existing differences on the part of the new government and
Central U. '

Dr. Rankin, assistant chancellor of student and general af’fa_irs,
said Dr.-Litchﬁeld and he learned that the decree was imposed by

the junta Jan. 219 when a student de‘mons_tration was held which did.
-not meet with the approval of the ruling powers. "

. . . _ “_Annual Affair”
“The demonstration,”
in commemoration of the day (Jan. 29, 1942) the country lost land

to Peru.” .

The 5,000 students at Central -University reportedly demonstrated

despite a government edict forbidding such a demonstration. Since '1 

that time, the institution has been under constant surveillance ot
armed guards. _ b ‘

Dr. Rankin noted[that_government leaders were “quite hos-

- pitable” and “tliey saidxthe situation. should be cleared up shoi-tly.’f _ 1

Eleven members of the University faculty are presently a part of
the Central University staff.'Dr. Rankin said the 11 are working ‘on
projects related to their particular ﬁelds of study until official word. is
received to resume classes. ' A

The. University dispatched its initial educational contingent to
Ecuador nine months ago. Since then the faculty representation from

here has increased to its present total as the ‘need for-instructors in

certain ﬁelds becomes evident.

“Similar Program”
‘-‘Catholic University (Ecuador), which has some St. Louis Uni-

versity faculty on its staﬁ, has a similar program to ours at Central,”

said Dr. Rankin. ‘ -

said Dr. Rankin, “is an annual affair staged 3 .

‘ .

of the Village’

However, he added that classes at Catholic University have —'
been uninterrupted as well as those at two other Ecuadorian in- _'
stitutions of higher learning. Students at those institutions did '

not demonstrate. ~

In addition to Central University, the University also has affiliates

in Chile and. Nigeria.

, BuildingC0mpletionﬂlapped

By TED DRIESCH
The Henry Clay Frick Fine Arts building on Schen-

ley Plaza will be the first among current construction.

projects to reach completion. According to William G.
Fisher, director of physical plant, the opening date will
be as close as possible to the start of the 1965 winter
trimester.

He suggested that the move of art collections would
‘be made at a time when the weather conditions would be
best. However, the contractor’s schedule remains the
determining factor for completion, which is set for mid-
November.

Fisher disclosed that General State Authority ﬁnanc-
ing and aid has been secured for the natural sciences
building, which is to be built next to Langley Hall. The
chemistry department is slated to move into the new
buildingduring the winter of 1967.

' - Other Buildings 
Also under General State Authority ﬁnancing and
scheduled for completion by the start of 1967 are the new
Engineering Hall on the site of Logan Armory, the Dental
Clinic next to Salk Hall, and the renovation of Salk Hall
" for the School of Pharmacy.

.,,,

A_lthough no funds have yet been appropriated,

the University still hopes to be able to tear down

 Forbes Field after the 1966 baseball season, to make

room for the new buildings to house the Law and
Social Work Schools.

The exactdate for tearing down Forbes Field de-
pends entirely on the planning and construction of the
new Northside Stadium. Work on the project is slated
for consideration this spring for the architects.

The Hillman Memorial Library, to be built along
Forbes Avenue, across from Schenley Hall, has been
allotted construction funds from the General State
Authority. Groundbreaking is expected this spring for
the library as well as for the adjoining Common Facilities
Building which will house several lecture halls and
classrooms.

' ‘Advice For Young Writers’

   
  

. By DEVRA LEE DAVIS

All the panelists of last Fri-
day’s Conference for Readers
and Writers -- C. P. Snow,
Marie Torre, Milton Lehman,
Frederick Maguire, and Jesse
Stuart -- agreed that they repe-
titiously discussed “Advice for
Young Writers.”

Maguire apologetically ex-
plained that “everything I could
have said has already been
said.” Stuart offered no apology,
merely a justifying accusation:
“They stole my -speech ’fore I
got up here.”

The surprise appearance of
Sir Charles Percy Snow made
up for the unfruitful question
and answer session redundant
advice. Snow advised his audi-
ences succinctly — “stay fresh
. . . be natural  . use a sim-
ple style.”

Following Snow, Miss Torre
preached what she practices.
Noted for her personally—re-
searched news stories, she sug-
gested that “there is no sub-
stitute for personal experience.”
She added that she had found
her job as copy girl more val-

“feller writers’? in his warm
Kentucky _language. ‘‘I don’t
like to give advice. And I don’t
«like to accept it. But write,
write, write‘ . . .” ‘

Dr. W. Geo_rge,Crouch, who
moderated the morning panel,
aptly frosted this lemon. “If
Miss .Torre writes compositions
for high school students . . . she
deserves to go to jail.”

Evidently Lehman also had
trouble with grades and themes.
He accepted his D on his first
freshman theme as a comeup-
pance message. “From this be-
ginning I could hardly help but
improve.” And, as Dr. Crouch
added, he ﬁnished with an A in
the course.

Like his fellow panelists,
Stuart drew largely from his
experience. He soundly drove
his point home. .“Don’t throw
anything away. I wrote a theme
when I was 16 --,’Nest Egg.’
It earned me 28 A’s in college

. . . It made the Atlantic Monthly
20 years later.”

Following lunch, Maguire dis-
cussed editing. Using an over-
head projector, he reduced ver-
bal atrocities to interesting sen--.
tences. He cautioned: “Never
cut to the bone . . . Never un-
derestimate the reader’s infor-
mation, nor overestimate his in-
telligence." .

' Newspaperman and professor
Maguire continued the discus-
sion by emphasizing the requi-
site of personal experience.
“Don’t write about Afghanistan
unless you’ve been there.”

Maguire cited a similarity of
his and Walt Witman’s news-
paper careers. Both were ﬁred
from The Brooklyn Eagle and
The Brooklyn Daily Times. In-
referring"to the present state
of journalism, he stressed the
“need for more personal in-
volvement.”

Next, Stuart addressed his

Though he gave little speciﬁc
advice, Stuart ‘did reveal the
origins of many‘ of his short
stories. “The Split Cherry Tree"
and “Love” were actual experi-
ences. “If you get emotional
enough and worked up enough,
you’re going to write some-
thing.”

Saturday.”

An amendment to lower the re-
quirements for secretary a n d
treasurer from 2.75 to 2.25 QPA
was defeated 14-2 after a lengthy
discussion. ‘

.In urging the amendments
defeat, Bijur said that lower-
ing the requirement to 2.25 is
removing the challenge of striv-
ing to do better to. gain the
offices. He proposed that the?
requirement be set at 2.5. The

proposal will be voted on at the
next meeting‘.

Bijur continued: “I feel that if
not enough people are willing to
run (for treasurer and secretary)_
the office will be left open until
the fall.” The suggestion was made
a motion by Bob Boylan and car-
ried. Bijur noted that starting next’
year MDC representatives falling
below a 2.0 will be removed."

I Substation Rejected

Sigmund Norr announced that
the idea of expanding the Uni-
versity post office into a substa-
tion resulted in rejection. How-
ever, installation of a scale and
price list are being considered.

Bijur complimented floors two
and three of Tower A for a “fine
job on short notice” in opening
their rooms to last weekend’s
Pitt Preview. He said: “People
were very impressed with the
Towers and setup of the rooms.”

As a vetrean of the trimester
“speed-up” program—only two
extra terms for graduation—I
have come to appreciate a most
unappreciated commodity at this
University: the great horde of

'0 people who ﬂoat through this
1 ‘school anonymously.

 a lot of time in the Tuck’ Shop

- activities that bring their names,

anonymous ones, though this

‘Luther is a veteran of the
U.S. Air Force where he is
called Captain Henry. Conse-

‘ ._ quently he is older than most

.-students here—he is in -his
thirties. And he is a Negro.

Calling a man a Negro, though,
is no longer a distinction. The
other’ day I was pointing him
out to a friend—Luther was in
the middle of a group of whites
and I said: “He’s the guy with
the red vest.” Do you know
what that little distinction
means? When you no lon.ger say:
‘fHe’s the colored guy.” It means
that you are growing up in terms
of the race problem today. And
this is my oblique ‘way of get-
ting back to Luther Henry di-
rectly. - .

unabashed idealist. He does not
mind being called a starry-eyed
crusader but he does get mad

The award is based on a point system for number and type of
activities and it is felt by some that these subsidies give Hawthorne House
an unfair advantage over the ordinary living units.

, The Council, however, decided that this was not necessarily true
-and thatthe House should remain eligible. '

It is rather hard to see, however, how the group could have
arrived at such a conclusion. If Hawthorne House is a select experi-
mental housing unit, receiving money not giving to the other groups,
then how can its activitiesbe compared with those of the other houses?
The answer is, of course, that the two cannot be compared. Haw-
‘thorne House should not receive the award nor should it ever be‘ eligible
for such a prize at any time in the future. To ﬁnance a single organization
and then to declare it no better than any other is just not /cricket.

Now a ‘guy who props up an
American ﬂag next to him is
ripe for some caustic com-
ments who

thinks he is a crackpot. Luther
carries the ﬂag because he
wants to call attention to the
fact that Negroes, as well as

whites, are citizens of this na-

Mr. Henry pulls the flag out
everywhere. Whenhe is in his
home territory having a drink
and surrounded by fellows who
say they do not have a country
-—they are Negroes, of course-

or that these United States have
no place for the Negro, why
Luther Henry pulls out the ﬂa-g
and launches into a spiel that

dazzles them with its simplicity

and truth. He says: “Were you
born here? Then this is your
country.”

’ vHe tells his ‘brothers that the

Negro has got to ﬁght for true
equality. The white man has
been putting" off the Tbatle too
long. Luther believes that any
white man who tells the Negro
to “go slow” with integration is
“conning” the negro.. Equality
NOW.

Luther is not the usual anony-
mous soul produced in any large
university like this. He writes
letters to the editor when a
white man has the ‘audacity to
write a letter ﬁrst saying that
the Negro is dominant over the
white. He lectures various
groups — whoever wants the
views of the educated negro.

He ‘even solicits, for who- u
ever wants his views. Last
summer, he wrote. a letter to
the head of KDKA-TV ex-

presing his feelings over the .,

brief racial strife that broke
out here concerning _jo.bs , at

That letter got Luther. on tele-
vision to preach his message.

LETTER . . 

Editor, The Pitt News:

Nancy Fuchs’ article, “A
Forced Equality,” is one of the
best written articles to have ap-
peared in The Pitt News this
trimester. In it, she revealed,
however, that she, like many
other intelligent men and wom-
en, doesn’t really know what
situation Mrs. Friedan is trying
to describe, nor what problem
Chancellor Litchﬁeld e x p e c t s

Mrs. Kline to -try to solve. This 2

letter is an attempt of a young
faculty wife to describe the sit-
uation and problem. _

’ Despite what girls and young
women hear all their lives from
parents, clergy, teachers, Girl
Scout leaders, et at, about. the

- importance of using talents to
contribute to society, the fact of-

our society is that a girl is not
expected or supposed to accept
this responsibility as a goal. She
learns from many more subtle
sources that her “ﬁrst duty is
to her husband and her family”
(quoting Miss Fuchs). This duty
is marked by taking pride in
correct things: in her husband’s

advancement, her healthy fam-

ily, her home-baked bread, and
so forth. Moreover, society lets
her know, she has no further
need than performing this duty.
. A girl soon learns that the cor-
rect answer to “what do you
want to be when you grow up”
is “a wife and mother.” '
t Suppose a boy, asked the
the same question, should re-~
ply, “a husband and father.”

gWe certainly hope so. There are 11 members from the University
faculty presenting working at Central U. and to have the entire. project

go to pot because of a petty diﬁerehce of opinion between the local- junta
-and some hot-blooded college students would be a terrible waste. »The
University has assumed a weighty_ responsibility in fostering higher edu-

cation in this relatively underdeveloped country but events of this sort
must raise questions concerning the quality of the government and not
just of the educational facilities.

sidered appropriate; he should
indicate what he hoped to be
as a person using his talents
rather than only as a member
of his sex. Indeed, everybody
knows that he will be a. bus-
band and father anyway.

Young women, often between
B.A. and Mrs., ﬁnd out that so-
ciety allows only the men to be
both man (i.e., member of his
sex) and person; women must
be content to be only members
of their sex. A woman who tries
to fulﬁll ‘her potential as ‘a per-
son, if her potential is to be
more than a wife and mother,

- is accused of trying to be a man

or deny her femininity, or do
other things smacking even more.
of a Freudian crime.

Some women never ﬁnd out
this restriction on their self—ful-
ﬁllment, or ﬁnd out too late.
Those ‘who do the former are
often the women whose poten-
tialities lie in the ﬁeld of do-.
mestic artistry. Those’ who do
the latter are often the women
from whom the B.A.-Mrs. inter-
val was perhaps short. The for-
mer are probably happy; the
latter feel the discrepancy be-
tween what society expects of
people and what society expects
of women as an insidious bur-
den. ‘

spiracy against them so huge

wife and mother, many of
which could be safely ignored,
to interfere with their abilities
and personal needs.

Mrs. Friedan calls the con-
spiracy to keep women from be-
ing people the Feminine Mys-
tique. In an era of a talent short-
age; the. Feminine Mystique is
not only unjust but stupid. Mrs.
Friedan, in describing‘ the prob-
lem, Chancellor Litchﬁeld and
others, in launching special aca-
demic programs f or women,
deans of women, in advising
coedsto fulﬁll some of the po-
tentialities of a BA. — all are
equipping women with tools to
"ignore the mystique.

The coeds seem to be the
hardest group ‘of women to
change. As a coed six years ago,
I held the same.opinion as Miss
Fuchs. Most coeds think that
they must be either women or
people, and, rather than hold
their own doors open, choose
the former. They succumb to the
mystique in thinking that ful-
ﬁllment as a person is synony-
mous with frozen apple pies.

In this attitude and in the
consequent choice, they dem-
onstate the power the mystique
has on even the most intelli-
gent young women of our so-
ciety.

Of course, men will be hus-
bands and fathers; »-of course
women will be wives and moth-
ers; and of course, all people

have also an obligation, need, . "

This is part one of a two-

next article in the series will

entist as a politician, focus-

of Dr.

By BILL NIEDERBERGER

The Political Science Depart-
ment, considered by many to be
among the strongest depart-
ments at the University, is mov-
ing along on three fronts in
1964; ﬁlling gaps in its curri-
culum with the addition of fresh

blood in'the faculty; complet-

ing an across—the-board Honors
Program for undergraduates;
and turning out a volume of
faculty publications.

The faculty additions have
been in three areas: urban af-
fairs, modern political theory,

_and Soviet government. The

urban affairs man, is Matthew
Holden, Ph.D., Northwestern, ,a
specialist in metropolitan com-
munities. He joined the Univer-
sity faculty in September.

Richard B. Friedman, of
Kenyon College in Ohio, also
joined the faculty in September.
Friedman, a specialist in 19 and
20th century political theory,
will receive his doctorate in the
near future. He is now com-
pleting work on his dissertation.
From the University of North
Carolina came Dr. James W.
Roberts. He began his work
here in January. Dr. Roberts is
an expert on the Soviet Union
specializing in Soviet foreign
policy.

Heaphey Moonlights

Also teaching an undergrad-
uate course this trimester is Dr.
James Heaphey, from the Uni-
versity of California, whose
main assignments fall in the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs. Dr. Heap-
hey, moonlighting in a sense,,is
teaching Public Administartion
for undergraduates, this tri-
mester only. ’

Of these faculty additions,
Dr. Holbert Carroll, chair-
man of the ‘department, said,

“We made an effort to cover '

every major ﬁeld «in Political
Science.”
I-Iindering Dr. Carroll’s im-
mediate effort to cover all ﬁelds

-in the curriculum is the absence

of two veteran faculty members
on special overseas assignments:
Dr. William Boyer is currently
teaching at Lahore University
in India; and Dr. John Chap-
man is an ‘advisor at the Uni-
versity of Bombay. Upon the
return‘ of these faculty mem-
bers, said Dr. Carroll, a possible
gap in the department’s world
coverage (Southern Asia and
India) will be ﬁlled. .
One Other Gap

.One other possible gap lies
in -A Latin America coverage, a
gap which Dr. Carroll hopes to
eliminate soon. “We hope to

add a faculty member this fall A

for Latin America,” he said.’

Progress has also been
made in the "Honors Program
of the department. “Our
Honors . Program is now

inter Sports
, Teams Successful

The winter sports season is now over except for the

national championships in swimming, wrestling’ and..

gymnastics, and an the whole the year should be con-
sidered a success. The wrestling and basketball teams
were the only squads with winning marks, but they are
the teams which are followed most closely so their efforts

‘negate the .500 seasons turned in by the swimming and

track teams and the losing record
of the gymnastics team.

The basketball team turned in
a 17-8 record and earned an invita-
tion to the NIT. Like last year they
lost their ﬁrst tournament game,
but it was still quite an achieve-
ment on behalf of the team to earn
a tourney invitation two years
running.

Tourney invitations won’t be
as abundant in the future. Al-
though next year’s team won’t be
as bad as it seemed they would
early in the season they willfall
way short of equaling the performance of the present

 

BOB SNIIZIK

' team.

All ﬁve of this season’s starters graduate, and with
them goes the end of an era in Pitt basketball. Brian
Generalovich, Cal Shefﬁeld, Dave Sauer and Paul Krieger

formed the greatest freshman team to ever play here
in 1960-61 and their performance through four years
will not soon be equaled. Dave Roman joined those four
in 1962 after transfering from Johnstown and those ﬁve,
along with Tim Grugurich, a redshirt who enrolled a half-
year before Generalovich’s class, have all played their last
game.

While basketball coach Bob Timmons loses his entire
starting team, wrestling coach Rex Peery loses only one
starter — Ken Barr. The rest of the regular lineup will
be back next season, in addition to —— Peery hopes --
Tim Gay and Bill Buchanan, who are currently ineligible.

The wrestlers’ season was as successful, if not more
successful than the basketball team’s. Peery took a team
expected to have a losing season and developed them
into the best dual meet and number two tournament team
in the East.

While the team deserves tremendous credit for their
showing, it would not have been possible if the entire
East was not sub—par this season. Lehigh and Penn State
suffered losses just as serious as the Panthers and also
came on to have ﬁne seasons, because the competition
just wasn’t that strong. ’

The competition was too strong for the gymnastics
team, which turned in a 2-6 record. Things look better
for the gymnasts next season, but they nolongerseem,
to be in a class with the likes of Syracuse, Penn State_
and‘Temple. - ‘

Even a bigger surprise than the wrestling team this
season was the swimming team. The swimmers had a 4-4
record after turning in an 8-1 mark last year. Th_ey were
expected to do much better since their only losses were
Rich Rush and Jerry Sollinger by graduation and Tom

Ribarchak by injury. The usual improvement and the

presence of sophomore standouts Don Hahnfeldt and
Andy James were expected to more than make up for
those losses. ‘

But that wasn’t the case as Ben-Grady’s team lost to
opponents they had beaten badly last year. Grady attri-
buted it to better opposition, which was probably true.
But the Panthers should have been better also. With the
team they had this year (they should have been much
better than 4-4 on the basis of last season’s record.

The track team had a successful record — by their
standards — this season. They had a 3-3 mark with wins
over such powerhouses as Rutgers, ‘Slippery "Rock and
Kent State. They couldn’t defeat the big schools, as they
were soundly beaten by Army, Navy and Notre Dame.

' Track coach Carl Rees complains every year about
the great depth Army and Navy have after they soundly
beat his team. If that is the case then Rees shouldn’t
schedule those teams and concentrate on the weaker
schools which seem to be in the class of the Panthers.

The ﬁve winter sports teams ended their seasons with
a combined record of 33-23. -This looks good in view of the
spring sports teams coming up- Three of the .four spring
teams — track, tennis and golf —- are perennial losers.

Even Bobby Lewis’s baseball team isn’t expected to be

F r Panther Basketball Team

Saturday’s 87-82 loss to Drake in the NIT ended the basketball career for seven
Panther players, ﬁve of whom were on the st arting team. Brian Generalovich, Cal Shefﬁeld,
Dave Sauer, Paul Krieger, Dave Roman, Tim Grgurich and Dink Larkin are the gradu.
ating seniors.

The latter two were redshirted
for a year and were the two play-
ers who didn’t start, although
Grgurich has been a spot starter
for two years.

Generalovich, Sheﬁield, Sauer
and Krieger have been here since
their freshman year, while Roman
came here from Johnstown last
season. As sophomores these play-
ers had a 12-11 mark. Last year it
was 19-6, and this season, 17-8.

Despite the fact that this
year’s record was not as good as
last season’s, Panther coach Bob
Timmons says that the season
was just as successful. “We
played a tougher schedule this
year,” he said, “including the
Los Angeles classic which had
the number one and two teams
in the country.

Timmons added, “Individually
this is the best team I’ve ever
coached. The team with Hennon
and Pegues on it was better as a
team, but this club has better in-
dividual stars. -

Timmons reserved most of his
individual praise for Sheffield"
and Generalovich. “Cal learned
to play defense," he said, “and
this Ytar he was our most con,-
sistent player.” .Sheﬂ’ield ﬁnish-
ed with 1115 points for his three
years of varsity play to become
the fourth-highest scorer in Pitt
history. .

Generalovich ﬁnished one point
behind. The General came through
for the Panthers in all "the big

 IF Track Meet Set Tomorrow;

Bowlers In Post-Season Games

/ ,1

The inteiufraternity‘track meet will be held tomorrow night
at 6 pm. at Fitzgerald Field House and IM director Leo Bemis
is hoping for as big a turnout as last season when 100 Greeks
showed up.

Delta Sigma Phi, champion in 1962 andrunnerup last year
looms as the favorite’ in this season’s meet. The Delta Sigs ﬁn-
ished 11% points behind champion Phi Epsilon Pi last year. Pi
Lambda Phi and Delta Tau Delta tied for third last year.

It an a:

Two Panther bowlers, Ron Smith and team captain, Bob
Ronnlund, have participated in post-season tournaments.’
Smith was recently notiﬁed that he had won the Tri-state '

Invitational Bowling Tourney _in Grove City with a 191
average. .

Ronnlund, however, won the regional A. C. U. bowling tour-
ney last week and will compete in the national championships
on April 5-6, at Oakland, California. Ronnlund, who averaged

187 in regular league competition, will have all expenses paid.

When Bruno’s Boys won the intramural basketball champion-
ship last Thursday, it marked the third consecutive year inde-
pendent teams comprised of football players dominated the
league.  ‘

Last year the Buckeyes, comprised of football players’
Jim Traﬁcant, Al Grigaliunas, Lou Slaby, John Yaccino, Paul
Cercel, and John Chisdak, placed third in the league. In
1962, the same team won the championship.

The Bitunos were also -an all-football player team, with
Ken Lucas, Mitch Zalnasky, Phil Dahar, Jim Dodaro, Bill Howley,
and Ray Conway as its members. The Drifters, ‘who were second
in the Independent League, were comprised of football players
Bill Bodle, Tom Black, Tom Abele, and Bill Beck. ‘C

Panthers’ Iiiexperience T ypical’ of East

Seeding, Depth Hurt VVrestlers

The Panthers’ loss at the Eastern
Championships can’t be-blamed on inex-
perience; for the whole tournament this
year seemed to emphasize the fact that
this is a rebuilding
year in the East. Only
12 of the 36 wrestlers
who ﬁnished in the top
four places were sen-
iors. '

Most of the teams
in the East have pre-
dominately juniors and
sophomores on their
rosters. Only three of
the champions were
seniors and the Pan-
thers only have one

 

TOM BAILY
senior in their starting line-up.

Another fact brought out in the Easterns
was the importance of the seedings.
Panthers were seeded fourth which meant they

Three ‘

had to face the top seeded wrestlers in the semi-
ﬁnals. ‘ '
All three of the Panthers lost, which hurt
the team’s chances in the overall score. Only
Tom Baily and Dino Boni could ﬁnish third
while Frank 0’Korn took fourth. ,,_This can’t
be used as an excuse because the seedings are
based on dual meet records during the season.
The main reason for the Panthers’ second
place ﬁnish and even for Syracuse’s third place
showing is the old problem of lack of depth.
Lehigh had a regular man at every position with

very few changes in their line-up. However, the"

Panthers didn’t have a set line-up at all.
Depending where the opponent was weak

coach Rex Peery would insert his men where ‘

they had the best chances. Lee Hall and Ken
Barr switched weight classes, Clair Riley, 137-

pounds, was inserted when needed and O’Korn ‘

was not his regular weight until halfway
through the season;

Both Barr and Hall wrestle better at 177
pounds, however Hall had to get down to 167
because no other wrestler was available.

Things have changed a lot since a Chevy
was only a Chevy. Especially your ideas
of what you want a Chevy to be.

_ So now you’ have the Jet-smooth Chev-
rolet-_e-17% feet _of pure luxury, bumper
to bumper. The size makes it a luxury car.
But not the price. ‘

- Or you can choose the thrifty Chevy II,
a 15%-foot family car with all kinds of
passenger and luggage space.

This year, your choice might be
the new 16:foot-plus Chevelle,
sized to .ﬁt nicely between Chev-

Then, too, there’s the sporty’ 15-fool;

touched an inch of ‘it. And ﬁnally, Cor.

for any true sports-car lover to say no to.
The long and short of it is, you don’t
have to go to_any length to ﬁnd exactly
the kind of car you want. Just

see the ﬁve different lines of cars
at your Chevrolet dea1er’s. '
