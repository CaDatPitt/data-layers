Study: Lesbian,
bisexual teen’

girls face more

risks than peers

Em Maier
Assistant News Editor

A recent study by Pitt researchers sug-
gests that teenage girls who identify as
LGBTQ are at higher risk for substance
abuse and behavioral problems.
Published in the Journal of the Ameri-
can Psychiatric Nurses Association, the
study examined data from the Pittsburgh
Girls Study, which has collected data

from numerous waves of participants . 

since 2000 and assesses girls annually to
examine the development of depression
and other conduct problems. .

The data was collected from young
women aged 16 to 19 years old: 1,891
self—identiﬁed heterosexual girls and 173
“sexua1—minority girls” (bisexual or les-
bian). The study also sought to determine
if there was a pattern moderated by race.

The authors noted that despite previ-
ous literature showing higher risks for
“sexua1—minorityl girls,” research “has
either combined boys and girls or only
focused on behavioral health problems,
such as HIV risk behavior, among sexual—
minority boys.” The 2013 study is one of

Students of different faiths ﬁght for prayer room

Natalie Daher
Assistant News Editor

Justin O’Connor and Louie Al—Hashimi
practice different religions, but over
the past nine months, they have worked
together on ajoint faith-based project
to beneﬁt all religious groups at the
University of Pittsburgh.

O’Connor, a Catholic, and Al—Hashi-
mi, a Muslim, noticed that the Univer-
sity lacked a permanent space for stu-
dents of faith and have been working
with administrators to fill this void.

O’Connor said that this project has
enabledlhim and Al—Hashimi to “talk

about beliefs with a capital ‘B’ and not

have something to be scared of.”

At public universities, students are
exposed to a broad range of races and
cultures, which cultivates an open-
minded and expressive environment.
But in some cases, incorporating re-
ligion into classroom discussion and
campus buildings is a challenging task

RELIGION

when the topics are treated as taboo
— as in the case of crossing the lines
of church and state.

After months of pressure from re-
ligious student groups, Pitt said it will
create a space called the “Mind, Body
and Soul Floor” on the third floor of
the William Pitt Union. The administra-
tion, in conjunction with leaders from
the student groups, is working on the
details to make the space as accom-
modating to all religions as possible.

While the Heinz Chapel provides a
sacred space that would feel familiar to
many Christians on campus, O’Connor
said that he wouldn’t expect Muslims to
worship there.

For him, the lack of a permanent
space for Muslims is the “biggest un-
ﬁlled student need to take into con-
sideration.”

“Muslim students are meeting their
religious needs in Chevron stairwells,”
he said.

Observant Muslims are required to
pray ﬁve times per day, and the Univer-
sity agreed to accommodate them with a
reserved room on the third floor of the
Union. The room is occupied by about
15 chairs, and a list of prayer times
is posted on the room’s white board.
As more students began to utilize the
room, especially during Friday Islamic
prayer, it gradually became too smallto
ﬁt the growing number of attendees.

While the Muslim Student Associa-
tion began reserving larger rooms in
the Union or O’Hara Student Center
for Friday prayer, Al-Hashimi still felt
that a room designated for religious
purposes was a “necessity.”

“For a lot of members of the MSA,
there’s an urgent need on campus for a
place where people can take care of all
their needs,” said Al-Hashimi.

The Layout

The current plan is to use the space

that used to house the Counseling Cen-
ter before it relocated to Nordenberg
Hall in August. The space is now under
renovation.

According to Kathy Humphrey, dean

of students, the ﬂoor will contain areas A

for physical ﬁtness, including cardio
equipment and space for classes, and a
study lounge similar to the one on the
ninth ﬂoor of the Union. Additionally,
it will include a reﬂection room.

“We are not creating a ‘prayer room’
that is connected to any speciﬁc re-
ligion, but rather a quiet space that
can be used by any student to reflect,
meditate or pray,” Humphrey said in a
statement.

An idea emerged during Martin Lu-
ther Kingjr. week last spring semester.
Al-Hashimi and leaders of other student
organizations attended a panel on reli-
gion and student life, where they ﬁrst
requested a functional prayer space in
front of Humphrey and other admin-
istrators.

Discussions progressed following

the January event, and the students
also took a field trip with Humphrey
to Carnegie Mellon University to View
its campus prayer room.

The multi—denominational prayer
room, located in CMU’s University
Center, features a padded carpet, the
washing stations Muslims are required
by faith to utilize, prayer rugs and no
chairs. Ken Lawson, a CMU spokesper-
son, said the location was chosen be-
cause it is central and most accessible
to students. The room holds about 50
to 60 people.

“It’s always been a need on campus to
have outlets for spiritual and religious
exploration,” Lawson said. “We know
that it’s important to people.”

CMU has had a non—denomination—
al chapel for 20 years, but added the
prayer room a decade ago. ’

“It’s proven that it’s something pro-
vided for students at other universi-
ties,” Al-Hashimi said.

He said that CMU’s non—denomina-

 

tional chapel “wasn’t serving Muslim
students as well as it could have,” as
it featured “judeo-Christian” features
such as stained glass windows and rows
of chairs for prayer. Because Muslim
and Buddhist students do not use chairs
to pray, CMU added the prayer room to
“meet the demand of students’ needs.”

He added that CMU, like Pitt, takes

,,a “holistic” approach to student de-

velopment that includes spirituality,
athletics, clubs, interest groups and a
“rounded education.” Lawson said that
the schools have an important obliga-
tion to “support people’s faith.”

“Most people do have a faith, or
participate in some type of spiritual
exploration, especially during the col-
lege years. It’s a fundamental part of
being human,” he said. “How all of that
gets expressed on a college campus is
up to the individual and how they work
in that campus environment.”

“[Religion] has a place, and it exists,
whetheror not the university is provid-
ing good and healthy outlets for those
things to flourish, so [students] don’t
feel ostracized or isolated from the rest
of the community,’ he said.

Mixing Academia and Religion

While almost any other topic is up
for discussion on a college campus, the
topic of religion remains taboo.

O’Connor, a history and English
literature major, feels uncomfortable
bringing up religion in the classroom
even though it defines his daily life.
He said that faith is‘ reduced to a “bad
joke” or a “friend’s embarrassing way
of dressing.”

“Religion is supposed to be private,”
he said, adding that talking about faith
is equivalent to being “over-obsessed
with your pet.”

Mohammad Mozumder, a graduate
student at Pitt who teaches sociology of
religion, said that secularism, or indif-
ference toward religion, results from
rapid modernity.

STUDY

a few publications focused exclusively on
lesbian and bisexual girls. ~

While boys abuse drugs more fre-

quently than girls, any use by girls can
cause problems speciﬁc to the female sex,
such as “unintended pregnancy due to
risky sexual behavior when intoxicated,”
the article states.
_ Michael Marshal, the primary author
of the 2013 study, commented on the
numerous risks for sexual-minority girls,
such as high rates of suicidal ideation,
depression, substance abuse and conduct
disorder.

“There is ample evidence that [sexual-
minority youth] suffer from highly in-
validating environments,” Marshal said.

The only interaction between race
and sexuality occurred in the predic-
tion of conduct disorder. The disparity
in conduct disorder incidence between
sexual-minority girls and heterosexual
girls was larger among black girls than
that seen in white girls.

According to Marshal, the study was
one of the ﬁrst to ﬁnd higher rates of bor-
derline personality disorder, a diagnosis
that has both internalizing and external-
izing dimensions. Individuals with this
disorder often are reckless, exhibiting
dysfunctional relationships, emotional
instability and an unstable self-image.

In the journal article, Marshal cau-
tions individuals not to overextend the
results of the study.

“Despite these alarmingly big dispari-
ties reported by [lesbianand bisexual
girls], it is important to recognize that
many [sexual-minority girls] did not
report substance use or mental health
problems,” she said. “It will be impor-
tant for future research to focus on
[sexual-minority girls] who are happy
and healthy, despite the potentially high
levels of adversity they face living in a
very homophobic and violent culture.”

RELIGION

Technological and scientific advance-
ments inhibit religion as an “informal
taboo.” ’

“The more you become modern and
scientiﬁc, the more religion should be
more privatized and not expressed in
public life,” he said.

While the students initially planned

‘to include the word “prayer” in the

room’s title, the administration omit-

ted the word in favor of “reflection.”

O’Connor hopes that the University
will keep the students’ religious goals in
mind, so the project does not “teeter on
the edge of a second Stress Free Zone.”

The Stress Free Zone is located on
the ground floor of the Union and pro-
vides services such as yoga and medita-
tion to students.

“I’m not too concerned about where
it’s located, but calling it a ‘Mind, Body
and Soul Floor’  At least make it clear
that we’re talking about spiritual stuff

here,” O’Connor said.

[O’Connor is worried that the Univer-
sity’s plans may only help Pitt’s market-
ing, rather than create a modest space
for group prayer.

“Is the University taking this legiti-
mate student effort to fill a need in the
student body for religious practices and
making it into some floor that will look
really great on letters sent to donors
and prospective students?” he asked.

Ken Service, vice chancellor for
communications, said the University

will call the room a meditation room
to “be respectful and inclusive of all
of our students.”

“The room is not being designated A

a ‘prayer’ room because it will also be
available for quiet reflection for stu-
dents who do not identify with any
particular faith,” he said.

“The contention that the room is
being redesigned to attract alumni do-
nations is completely without validity,”
Service added.

Lawson said that "CMU includes

the word “prayer” in the room’s title.

because it is specifically designed for
worship.

Religion has become a more promi-
nent part of the fabric of campus life
elsewhere, as well. .

According to a report in The New
York Times last month, Troy University
in Alabama and" Texas A&M University
are offering new faith-themed dorms
to students. .

The projects raise questions about
the institutional vote of religion at pub-
lic universities.

A tolerant culture

The hope among students involved
in the project at Pitt is that a collec-
tive on-campus space will integrate
religious and non-religious students
in a central location‘: \._

Al-Hashimi hopes th room, which
is now under construction, will cre-
ate more opportunities for dialogue,

fostering a “more tolerant campus‘

culture.”

O’Connor said that students who
practice their religion are often con-
fined to their own groups. He wants
to see a common space that will be an
outlet for a public display of faith, in-
terfaith socialization and events.

“Misunderstandings and stereo-
types happen when people don’t know
people as people,” O’Connor said. “This
room willlremind people that there are
students of faith at Pitt. They’re not
weirdos on the fringes, but actually
involved in other stuff,” he said. I

Limitations necessary for Room for Debate

Naomi Borrebach
T Columnzkt

A Nov. 1 article in The New York

Times’ Roomfor Debate series
on the newspaper’s online opin-

-ions section asks t-he question,

“Are spiky heels an appropriate
fashion statement for the of-
ﬁce?’.’ The New York Times print-
ed responses from a blogger, a
style 'expert,- two podiatrists, a
chiropractor, a performer and
even a shoe museum curator.

Room for Debate is a se~
ries that allows knowledgeable
laypersons to contribute their
thoughts on an issue.

Marney Reid, who runs the
blog “Stilettos on the Glass Ceil-

ing,” called high heels a “pro—
fessional disadvantage” because
they limit one’s mobility (despite

the fact that most office jobs.

are -fairly sedentary, and most
people doing an ofﬁce job don’t
really need ultra-comfy shoes to
power-walk to meetings.) Tele-
vision style expert Chassie Post
said that heels connote style and
power, and that it is “[her] stud-

ied opinion that everyone looks.

better in a heel, no contest.” V
The consulted podiatrists
and chiropractors gave advice

about the health risks involved

with wearing heels higher than 2
inches, largely because they shift
the body’s weight and gravity to
the front, not the back, of the

foot. One podiatrist advised that
one should rotate heel heights,
avoiding wearing very high heels
all day, every day.

Although it might seem like a
simple question to ask whether
or not it’s appropriate for women
to wear heels in the workplace,
this question raises a lot of ques-
tions regarding gender equality,
health, sexuality and, most im-
portantly, whether or not “ex-
perts” (or just everyday people)
should be allowed to make judg-
ment calls about other people’s
wardrobes (or other lifestyle
choices).

I have another question for

the New York Times opinions section
staff: Why do you think it’s helpful to your
readership or society at large to create a
discussion about the “appropriateness”
of women’s shoes?

Opening up women’s professional‘

wardrobe choices to public criticism
quickly turns into a critique of bodies,
sexuality and individual choices.

For example, it isn’t really a problem

that Post says wearing heels makes her
feel taller, sleeker and more powerful. She
is entitled to her feelings and her choices.
However, I ﬁnd it very problematic for her
to then say that if other powerful women
—— such as Michelle Obama or Marissa
Mayer — wear heels, you should, too.
The Room for Debate series has cov-
ered probably every topic that could pos-
sibly be interesting to the public, from the
serious — “Would government-owned
banks distort the free market or comple-
ment private len‘ding‘._”’ (Oct. 1) —— to the
random — “Should salt have a place at

the table?’’ (Sept. 10) — to the judgmental
and sensationalist — “Should men over
40 avoid, trendy looks?” (Oct. 3).

Newspapers —— and especially seri-
ous, authoritative publications — should,
when doing pieces like the Room for De-
bate series, keep questions to current
events and the news, and not public
judgments over other people’s bodies
and choices.

It’s time that we put playground bully—
ing over what is .and is not a professional
shoe choice to rest. I I ,

FILM REVIEW

‘12 Years a Slave’ an unwavering glimpse at Antebellum South

Brett Murphy
Senior Stqff Wrz'ter

“12 Years a Slave”
Directed by: Steve McQueen
Starring: Chiwetel Ejiofor,
Michael Fassbender

Grade: A

Dangling from a noose, Solomon Nor-
thup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) tiptoes in the
mud until sundown, ﬁghting strangula-
tion. While the cicadas buzz overhead
and children laugh in the tall grass,
Solomon —— or Platt, as the overseers
have dubbed the once—prominent free-
man from Saratoga -— steals breaths.
Breathing had been one of few liberties
afforded to him since he was abducted
and sold into slavery in the pre—Civil
War United States.

This is possibly the hardest scene to
watch in Steve McQueen’s “12 Years a

Slave” — quite a superlative consider-
ing the brute force of the movie. Mc-
Queen lets the camera linger in this
scene and others, panning across a
fairytale sunset over silhouetted trees
in Louisiana, while in the background,
men scream and whips crack, spraying
the air with a mist of blood and sweat.

McQueen hammers these kinds of
juxtapositions to convey the normalcy
of-insanity governing the Antebellum
South. For 130 minutes, viewers ﬁdget

own skin. McQueen has made a name

Maryland—based brewery concocts a strange, seafaring stout

My Washington, D.C., upbringing exposed
me to the Atlantic Ocean’s fresh bounty at
a young age, making an indelible impres-
sion. Now, whenever chance takes me
home, I make sure to hit one of the city’s
many unpretentious seafood joints with
old friends and tear into a mountain of
crabs or clams. ,

The only thing that makes seafood bet-
ter? Beer, of course. Beer and seafood are
wonderful bedfellows, complementing
one another’s ﬂavors and adding to an
experience that should really be shared.

I love seafood with beer, but I’Ve nev-

Fortunately, Frederick, Md.’s Flying Dog
Brewery went spectacularly out of its
mind and has done just that.

Where I was timid, Flying Dog was
brave, brewing a stout beer with actual
oysters incorporated into the process.
Once a limited edition offering, Pearl
Necklace Oyster Stout is now a year-round
brew arid, as insane as it may sound, we’re
all better off for it.

Pearl Necklace is a visually pleasing
beer, pouring a cloudy black, like a good
stout should, and developing a thick tan

bly the craziest beer on the market today,

“12 Years a Slave,” it doesn’t have the

The lead character of “Shame” is too
much of a case study, though Fass-

ed—to-ﬁerce juggling act that he also
brings to “12 Years a Slave”——but he’s

McQueen’s movie gives a ground-ﬂoor
ear to a 3o,00o—foot issue. In both
ﬁlms, the wrongly imprisoned — ﬁrst
outward and explicit in their torment
and frustration, wearing their deﬁance
like shackles — retreat within them-
selves. Their prison becomes a battle
of self—preservation. On his way to the
ﬁrst slave trade post along the Missis-
sippi, Solomon proclaims, “I don’t want
to survive. I want to live.”

a long day — the warmth of his wife
and the smell ofhis children. He knew

“The Counselor”

Directed by: Ridley Scott
Grade: C+

Armed with an excellent cast, an experi-
enced director, and a celebrated writer,
“The Counselor” appeared to have enough
resources to be a compelling adult drama,
but the underused and misdirected talent
led a disappointing and baﬁling clutter of
colorful confusion.

tion of actors are about all that “The Coun- donebyan inconsistent quality of dialogue,
selor” has in its favor. The ﬁlm is slowly un- a dangerous lack of exposition and a largely

unsatisfying conclusion.

Michael Fassbender once again offers an
extraordinary performance as a man sim-
ply referred to as “Counselor.” Caught up in
drug smuggling and ill—prepared to face the
repercussions of unfortunate circumstances,
Counselor struggles tp keep himself and his
ﬁancee Laura (a sorely underused Penelope
Cruz) alive. Although Fassbender can sell the
desperation of his situation, the absence of
a courageous and daring protagonist feels
misplaced in a ﬁlm so unfazed by itsown
ridiculousness. Writer Cormac McCarthy’s
ﬁlms generally lack a protagonist in the tra-
ditional sense of the word. ‘

, Counselor has a few acquaintances in
his illegal activities. Westray (Brad Pitt, in
another decent turn) is a conﬁdent middle-
man, and Reiner (Javier Bardem sporting
a disgracefully bad haircut) is an eccentric
friend deeply involved with drug trafficking,

BEER

and, though I may have imagined it, a bit
of salty ocean water.

Those who have visions of stinky, ﬁshy
beer with bits of shellfish swimming about
need not be afraid. The oysters impart no
discernible ﬁshy or unpleasant ﬂavor but
add an intriguing brininess. If you don’t
believe me, Flying Dog public relations
manager Erin Weston says, “It’s really
about 10 oysters per barrel  but we also
add sea salt to the beer to give it that nice,
briny quality.” The salty quality that the
oysters and, of course, the salt bring to
the table back up the stout’s burnt char-
acter, highlighting its subtle sweetness.

Were one to be given the beer not
knowing its not-so-secret ingredient, it
would be easy to mistake the oysters’ salt
for mild hops. There’s one more piece of
good” news to aid the revelation that there
isn’t much actual ﬁsh in the beer at all.
Concerning shellﬁsh allergies, Weston
says, “It’s really a trace amount of oysters
per barrel that are used  based on the

November 5, 2018 I The Pitt News l vvvvw.pittnevvs.com

proportions that we were given, its safe
to drink.” A beer drinker with shellﬁsh
allergies can happily drink Pearl Necklace
without holding an EpiPen inches above
his or her thigh. a

What sounds like a mad brewer’s dark-
est experiment is actually a very good and
easily drinkable beer. Though I would not
recommend it to someone with an aver-
sion to stouts and porters, Pearl Necklace
is a mild brew with one unusual ingredient
and should inspire no more fear than a
Guinness. 4

Still not convinced? Fine. What if I
told you that by drinking Pearl Necklace,
you are ‘saving the world? Okay. Not the
world, butoysters that deﬁnitely help

make said world go ‘round. In adding»

Pearl Necklace to their regular lineup,
Flying Dog has partnered with the Oyster
Recovery Partnership. it

A The partnership is a Maryland-based
nonproﬁt, dedicated, predictably, to re-
storing the Chesapeake Bay’s dwindling
oyster population. The idea came about
as so many great ones do: over a beer.
Weston laughs, “We were at an event with
the Rappahannock River Oyster Com-

pany [which grows oysters in Virginia],
talking about drinking beer and eating
oysters. All the stuff we enjoy.” A speaker
at the event brought up the idea of using
beer proﬁts to fund oyster recovery and,
for Flying Dog, the idea was too good to
pass up.

Soon after, Pearl Necklace was born.

Through sales of its oyster stout, Fly-
ing Dog intends to play a major role in
bringing the oyster population back from
the brink. Indeed, they already have. “In
2012 alone, the proceeds from Pearl Neck-I
lace helped to replant 1 billion baby oys~l

ters back into the Chesapeake Bay,” says V

Weston with discernible (and justiﬁable)

. pride. East coast seafood restaurants and

enthusiasts would rejoice at a resurgence
in the oyster population and,‘with any
luck, their exorbitant price will fall as
supply increases. * 1

Don’t let the beer’s apparent lunacy
put you off. It’s a solid ‘stout that is not
nearly as weird as the name implies and
exists to both delight your taste buds and
do a little bit of good in the world. I’ll
drink to that. I

COUNSELOR

? alongwithhis ravenous andwicked girlfriend

Malkina (Cameron Diaz). -

It would likely be a challenge for anyone to
explain the ﬁlm’s plot given how little the ﬁlm
explains itself. While ideally it is refreshing
that a ﬁlm resists force-feeding plot details
to the audience,i“The Counselor”. is far too
befuddling for its own good — the story,
particularly. the conclusion, is not fascinating
nor satisfying enough to compensate for the

‘ enormous lack of -clarity. “The Counselor”

is nonetheless absorbing solely due to the
expectation that the ﬁlm will eventually re-
veal itself to be compelling underneath the
pulpy style, mostly uncomfortable sexual
material and startling moments of violence
— although, regrettably, it isn’t.

Scott, despite decades of reasonably great

' ﬁlrnmaking, hardly seems conﬁdent in this
ﬁlm’s direction. The ﬁlm stumbles from dra- ,

ma to action tounnecessary sexual scenes in
an aimless stupor. McCarthy’s frustratingly
«uneven dialogue hardly helps the problem.
The ﬁlm in its entirety seems so concerned
with being edgy and sensationalist that any
enjoyment soon evaporates in the haze of the
manufactured sleaziness.Whether ti-he messi-
ness is intentional or not, “The Counselor”
is unforgivably sloppy.

It’s easy to be seduced by the quality of the
actors, writer and director involved with the

ﬁlm. However, upon the slightest reﬂection, »

the ﬁlm’s lazily constructed ideas crumble
into a heap. . 7 l g‘

Though saved in some respects by good
performances and an assertive visual style,

“The Counselor” remains atrashy, confound- '

ing, unsettling and narratively unﬁilﬁlled

between the moss—1ined mountains and white

. is the newest face on the Pitt men’s basketball

team.

Ko’s hometown — Kailua, to be exact -
has apopulation of 40,000. Although the town
is 4,651 miles from Pitt’s Cathedral of Learn-
ing, Ko’s situation proves that the world really
isn’t as big as it may seem.

A Ko attended Kalaheo High School, which
onlylserves a small amount of Kailua’s resi-

Smith, was a standout guard at the University
of Hawaii from 1994 to 1998 and is the third-
leading scorer in the program’s hisugwith
1,415 points. . .

Following Smith’s ﬁnal season at Hawaii,
current Pitt head coachjamie Dixon accepted
an assistant coaching job at Hawaii underfor—
mer head coach Riley Wallace. Dixon had also
served as an assistant to Wallace from 1992 to
1994, and he helped land the commitment of
Smith, who is a Hawaii native.

Donald named ACC Defensive Lineman of the Week

aron Donald (#97) recorded SIX tackles for loss in atus-day’s - is to Georgia Tech. Bobby Mizia |Visua| Editor

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt defensive tackle Aaron Donald con-
tinues to build a strong case as the first
Pitt All-American since H.B. Blades in
2006. The latest achievement for Don-
ald was being honored as the Atlantic
Coast Conference’s Defensive Lineman
of the Week.

In Pitt’s 21-10 loss to Georgia Tech
Saturday, Donald shone brighter than
any player on either team. Donald
racked up 11 solo tackles, six tackles for
loss, two forced fumbles and one sack.

Donald’s six tackles for loss were the
most by any Football Bowl Subdivision
player. in a single game this season,

and Donald leads the nation with 2.4
tackles for loss per game. As a result
of his six takedowns behind the line of
scrimmage, nearly 10 percent of Georgia
Tech’s 63 plays Saturday were ended
by Donald.

Overall, Donald has compiled 36
tackles, 19.5 tackles for loss, nine sacks
and three forced fumbles. Donald ranks
third nationally at 1.1 sacks per game
and 12th in forced fumbles at 0.38 per
game.

’Donald’s honor follows the recent
news that he was named a semifinalist
for the Bednarik Award and a quarter-
finalist for the Lott IMPACT Trophy.

The Lott IMPACT Trophy, named
after NFL Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott,

s

is awarded on merits of both personal
character and athletic performance
from a defensive college player. The
Bednarik Award is presented each year
to the nation’s best defensive player,
regardless of position.

Other awards for which Donald will
likely receive consideration are the
Bronko Nagurski Trophy (best defensive
player), Outland Trophy (best interior
lineman) and Rotary Lombardi Award
(best lineman).

Earlier this season, Donald made his
way onto many mid-season All-Ameri-
can lists. CBS Sports, ESPN, Sports Il-
lustrated and national football analyst
Phil Steele all named Donald to their re-
spective list of the nation’s best players.

Coach Dixon was still coaching at the Univer-
sity of Hawaii as an assistant, my head coach
at high school was recruited by Coach Dixon
during that time. When I played for Coach
[Smith], I asked him ifhe had any connections,
and Coach Dixon was one of the main guys he
brought up, and from there, the connection
just kind of happened.

TPN: Although highly populated, your
hometown seems to be a strictly residential
area. What drew you into the big city and bright
lights of Pittsburgh? ‘

]K: In Hawaii, we don’t have the “fast life”
kind of thing. I wanted to get off the island
and come to the mainland, mainly preferring
coming to the East Coast and seeing how the
different lifestyle is.

TPN: On to basketball: You accomplished
a lot during your junior and senior seasons.
What are some highlights from those days?

JK: My senior season went very well. It’s
what every senior wants, to go out in high
school winning a state championship. During
my time in high school, my junior year, we won
the Divison II state championship, and in my
senior year, we won Division I, so in my state
that’s never been done before. We made his-
tory. After my senior season, Iwas lucky to be
player of the year and then actually nominated
as Gatorade player of the year for my state.I’m
truly blessed to be noticed as a top player in
my state, so that’s pretty cool.

TPN: What are your goals as a freshman
walk-on here at Pitt? .

JK: My goals for the year are to learn the
system here at Pitt. This is totally different
from basketball in Hawaii. We were mainly
slower paced than how the mainland plays
— just getting used to it, learning the plays,
learning the different style and just getting
along with the program.

TPN: Coach Dixon always says his guards
will see more minutes as their perimeter de-
fense progresses. Do you think you’re where
you need to be defensively, considering the
slow-paced style you played in Hawaii?

JK: I’m getting used to the adjustment of
here in the mainland, especially here at Pitt,
because at Pitt we’re trying to emphasize more
defense. If we can stop the team from scoring
that much itwill make the offense come much
easier to us. Defensively I’m trying to get up
there, but I think I’m almost there. I

McCoy‘leads former Panthers in Week 9

Lesean Mccny ieacls the NFL with 777 rushing yards this season. MCT Campus

‘Sean Corrado
Staff Wrz'ter

Many former Panthers were on a bye in
week nine of the NFL season, yet Pitt
fans were still able to show some pride
watching former Pitt players perform
at the professional level.

Philadelphia running back LeSean
McCoy (Pitt 2007-2008) scored his ﬁrst
touchdown in over a month against the
Oakland Raiders Sunday afternoon. He
took a swing pass down the sideline
from quarterback Nick Foles‘— who
tied an NFL record with seven touch-
down passes in the game — and ran 25
yards into the end zone.

McCoy finished the day with 44
yards, rushing on 12 carries and four
catches for 36 yards. His Eagles offense
finally came out of a slump and was able
to topple the Raiders, 49-20.

Despite only carrying the ball 12
times, mostly because Foles had a
career day, McCoy still maintains his

league lead in rushing. McCoy has now
chalked up his total to 777 yards on the
ground this year, which is 51 more than
Seattle’s Marshawn Lynch.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers cornerback

-Darrelle Revis (Pitt 2004-2006) re-

corded four tackles against Seattle, but
opposing wide receiver Doug Baldwin
was able to rack up 75 yards on the day
and a crucial game-tying touchdown in
the fourth quarter. '

Although the Buccaneers jumped out
to a 21-point lead in the first quarter,
they dropped the game in overtime,
27-24. -
Cleveland Browns defensive end ja-
baal Sheard (Pitt 2007-2010) looked
healthy again after struggling with a
knee injury through most of October.
He recorded four total tackles and a
sack in a 24-18 victory over division
rival Baltimore.

Amid rumors at last week’s trade

‘deadline, Cardinals wide receiver Larry

Fitzgerald (Pitt 2002-2003) stayed put
in Arizona. Cardinalsgeneral manager
Steve Keim addressed the rumors near

1 the deadline during a radio interview

with Arizona Sports 620 KTAR-FM.

“Our intent is for Larry Fitzgerald
to retire a Cardinal — period,” Keim
said. “If there is any gray area there,
let me know, and we can get that out.”
The Cardinals had a bye week this
week. '

Last Monday, the Houston Texans
signed the Panthers’ leading rusher
from last season, Ray Graham. Graham
(Pitt 2009-2012), an undrafted rookie,
was on the Texans practice squad after
spending training camp with the team.

Two other running backs, Deji Karim
and Dennis Johnson, were also added
to H0uston’s roster in order to provide
depth to an injured backﬁeld. Johnson
received eight carries against India-
napolis Sunday night, while Graham
did not receive a single carry. ﬂ
