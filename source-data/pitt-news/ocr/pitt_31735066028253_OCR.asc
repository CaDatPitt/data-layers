SGB accused of misusing power

 

A picture from last January's SGB retreat raises questions about whether business trips and retreats are iunkets.

Anthony Breznican

Editor In Chief
«All 10 members of the stu-
dent allocations committee

resigned Thursday, saying they
could no longer stand the “gross
misuse and manipulation” of
funds by Student Government
officials.

The committee is accusing
Student Government President
Justin DalMolin and Allocations
Chair Gerald Klayrnan of rnisus—
ing nearly $11,000 in -"activity
funds while the committee was

away during the summer.

They said they resigned
because DalMolin and the Student
Government Board refused to lis-
ten to their concerns.

The allocations committee
supplies money to student organi-
zations. This money is derived
from the $40 student activities fee
charged to each student annually.

SGB will begin searching for
new committee members on
Tuesday. Until then, all funding
requests will be handled by
Klayrnan, Da1Mo1in said.-

Entire allocations committee resigns because of SGB’si

The former committee mem-
bers say the violations include a
second retreat, luxurious business
trips around the state and events,
such as concerts, that are restricted
by the allocations manual.

A list of summer expenses
and a photograph of SGB mem-
bers celebrating in a hotel during
last January’s retreat have called
into question the necessity of these
excursions.

“It’s a blatant, blatant, blatant
misuse of funds,” Boone said.

wants with that money. We’re try-

The documents show that
$460 was spent on a second week-

the start of this term. Technically,
governance groups are only per-

RSA has no plan for the year after $l,000 weekend retreat

Lisa DiRenzo
For The Pitt News

This past weekend, some members of
the Resident Student Association spent
$1,000 on a weekend retreat 20 minutes
away and returned with no plan of action
for the new school year.

Eight RSA executive board presi-
dents; the RSA advisor, Dr. Stephen
Sivulich; and the SGB liason, Jen
Mollusso, stayed at the Greentree Marriot
near the airport to become oriented with
the RSA.

The RSA serves as a governing group

and works to meet the needs of students
living on campus. The RSA also promotes
student involvement in academic, cultural
and social events. In order to accomplish
all of this, the RSA assigns one executive
board president to each residence hall

At the retreat these RSA executive
board presidents gained an understanding
of the organization’s purpose by examin-
ing the RSA Constituion.

The constitution outlines academic,
cultural and social awareness issues for
the RSA, according to Sivulich.

' After becoming familiar with the con-
stitution, the executive board presidents

pinpointed ﬁve goals that need to be
accomplished during the upcoming acade-
mic year. .

All of the goals are directed towards
building a sense of community within the
residence halls by promoting a positive
image of residence living. A

The executive board presidents, how-
ever, were not willing to discuss the
specifics of each goal or the RSA's inten-
tions for the year.

“The eight RSA presidents decided as
a group that any questions concerning
their plans or the retreat be directed to me,
because they are such a new organization

on campus,” said Sivulich.

After reviewing these facts, many
would question why the RSA spent
$1,000 to stay at the Maniot instead of uti-
lizing a conference room on campus.

“This retreat was a lot more than just
devising ﬁve goals,” said Mollusso. “The
retreat allowed the RSA presidents to learn
how to work together and understand the
purpose of the RSA. They’re all really
excit ."

These presidents will devise a plan of
action and elect their board members at
their next meeting, which is slated for the
week of September 22.

But expensive ﬂights and fancy rental
cars used during the summer on other trips
have also tainted DalMolin’s excursions.

Boone and Valsamidis says DalMolin
never should have requested the money and
that Klayman never should have approved
such requests. Klayman acts for the com-
mittee during the summer, but DalMolin
has ﬁnal authority over all appropriations.

The documents provided ‘by Boone
and Valsamidis also show:

-DalMolin spent $1807 on a two-day
trip in May to Temple University in
Philadelphia. DalMolin and three SGB
members took a ﬂight to Philadelphia and
then rented a Lincoln Town Car. Members
spent $1202 on transportation, $300 on
lodging and $240 on food.

“It was the only [car] I could get,” he
said.

Klayman said some of the excessive
costs for food and travel were “simply mis-
takes.”

“That money can’t just go into some-
one’s pocket,” he said. “They have to spend
it on what is requested If the retail didn’t
cost $250 then that money’ goes back into
the fun .”

DalMolin said he often turned over
personal checks with histravel and business
request forms in order to make up the dif-
ference on items that cost less than the
money allocated for them. He said he could
not provide any canceled checks because he
does not save them. A

Other requests turned over by
Valsamidis and Boone show tint Klayman
and DalMolin repeatedly used funding for
restricted events and items such as concerts
and t-shirts.

Mills said the allocations committee

Former committee member Joe Mills
took issue with the ﬂights. '

“Why did they have to ﬂy? Why could-

to Philadelphia. It would cost about $50 to
$60,” he said. “That’s our job — to make
sure this money is being spent wisely. But
we can’t if no one wants to listen to us.”

DalMolin and Klayman said the ﬂights
were chosen over travel by car in order to
save time.

"Il1at’s, like, six hours on the road each
way,” DalMolin said. “'I'hat’s a lot of

DalMolin also said his use of the

was “not a luxury.”

DalMolin admitted his parking space is
usually paid for by the Oﬁice of Student

a mistake.

Klayman justiﬁed his space by saying
he was the only one processing all oftlrese
requests during the summer.

“I was here many horns and saw noth-
ing wrong with getting a space,” he said

Klayman and DalMolin stood by the
funding requests, and accused the former
committee members of being “stingy” and
trying to determine the agenda of the entire

DalMolin also expressed outrage that

Over4OO Pitt staff and faculty,
volunteer for Day of Caring  

Corrine LaFata
For The Pitt News

Karen Meharra was ready
for her mission. Her weapons:
a couple of rags, a bottle of
Lysol, a bucket and some
water. i '

, Some toys were A gonna get
it. A good cleaning, that is.

And they needed it. The
toys‘ home —— a basement —
had ﬂooded a few times.

Meharra was cleaning the
toys as a part of the Pitt-
United Way Day of Caring, a
day devoted to volunteerism
and service projects.

"It feels good to do some-
thing to help the community,"
said Meharra, a supervisor at
Hillman Library.

. On Wednesday, Sept.10,
approximately 400 Pitt staff
and faculty members volun-
teered for the annual event. In
past years, the activities were
held all over the city. But this
year, the volunteers focused
their efforts on Oakland and
surrounding neighborhoods.

Meharra was one of six
volunteers who spent the day
cleaning and sorting toys for
Catholic Charities at the
Rosalia Center facility in

North Oakland. The salvaged.

toys will be used in the

Catholic Charities Family Day
Care Project. '

Volunteers chose from 10
different community projects,
although three of the outdoor
projects were rescheduled for
Tuesday due to inclement
weather. '

At Veterans Affairs
Hospital, volunteers labeled
envelopes, spent time with
patients and lent their help
wherever it was needed.

"I look forward to the Day

of Caring every year," said ‘
volunteer Kathy Rud. "It's fun

and it really gives you a good
feeling to volunteer."

Rud, who works in Pitt's
Psychology Department, spent
the day labeling envelopes at
VA Hospital. She and the other
volunteers chatted as they
affixed the mailing labels.

‘'1 get to meet someone
new every year," said Rud.

Another hospital volun-
teer, Elizabeth Iarrapino, said
the event gave her a chance to
meet someone she talks to
daily over the phone.

"Pat here," she said, ges-
turing to a woman standing
near her, "I talk to her all the
time, but I never knew her."

The Day of Caring helps
to connect the University with
the community.

"It's an extraordinary com-
mentary on the‘University of
Pittsburgh community that
faculty, students and staff can
start off the school year with
something like this," said
Dennis Donham, Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs
and , Pitt—United Way
Campaign ,,Co—chair. "The Day
of Caring sends a message that
this is a community."

The University helped out
by giving its workers the day
off to participate in the events.

Joyce Nolle, who spent
the day painting a room in
Pittsburgh Vision Services
(formerly the Pennsylvania
Association for the Blind)
said, "It‘s nice that they give

' us one day off so we can go do

something for the communi—
ty. II

This is not the only United
Way event that the University
sponsors. In fact, the Pitt-
United Way Campaign hasn't
officially begun.

The official kick-off is
Oct. 16-and the campaign will
last until Nov. 26.

Money from the six-week

Stealth fighter jet crashes at air show near Baltimore  

Across the Nation

MIDDLE RIVER, Md., - An F-117 Stealth
Fighter, performing in an air show in
Maryland, crashed shortly after takeoff on
Sunday. At least two houses were left in
ﬂames, and at least four people on the
ground were injured. .

The pilot ejected safely. There were no
immediate reports of deaths.

The plane went down just after 3 p.m.
during a performance at the Chesapeake Air
Show at the Glen Martin State Airport,
according to Baltimore County Fire Captain
Steve Gisriel. He told CNN the plane
crashed into a eondo—marina complex on the
Chesapeake Bay near Baltimore. All four
people injured were believed to be in the
complex.

Sharon Schuchardt was watching the air
show from a boat and witnessed the crash.
"It was horrible," she said to CNN. "It was
huge, a total explosion."

An Air Force spokesman conﬁrmed that
the F-117 went down and that the pilot eject-
ed but had no other information.

PITTSBURGH - If life stinks, Arnold
Zlotnick has a cure. His Pittsburgh—based
company is on a, mission to deodorize the
air.

And apparently, no stench is too strong
to tackle.

Zlotnick, president of Surco products
incorporated, has established about 350
chemical compounds to counteract different
smells. Last years sales were in the $9 mil-
lion dollar range. Surco is one of ﬁve such
companies operating nationally. But while
other companies spritz the malodor with per-
fume or trap the offending smell, Surco's
main philosophy is counteracting.

The company adds a second smell
designed to produce a neutral odor.

Zlotnick says business has been perking
up, mostly due to increased public aware-
ness that a bad smell may indicate pollution.
More often, an industry or business calls for
odor control after complaints from citizens
or orders from the government.

RUNNING SPRINGS, Calif., - A wildﬁre
is still raging out of control in Southern

California.

-The ﬁre, which began in a shooting
range, has charred more than 1200 acres in
the San Bernardino National Forest, and
destroyed 13 homes and cabins since it
began yesterday. There are no reports of
injuries.

The blaze is only ﬁve percent contained
and has forced the evacuation of hundreds of
homes in the Running Springs area between
Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear lake. The
main road into the resort area remains
closed.

. Heavy smoke has hampered ﬁre-
ﬁghters, and there's also a worry about high
winds from Hunicane Linda.

Around t_he World

AMNIAN, Jordan - The Secretary of State
continues hopscotching across the Mideast,
trying to leave momentum‘ for peace in her
wake.

Madeleine Albright’s latest stop is
Amman, Jordan, where she's praising King
Hussein's leadership and his willingness to

make peace with Israel. p

Albright is also urging the Israelis and
Palestinians to make hard decisions for
peace. She says that means the Palestinians
have to root out terror, and ﬂie Israelis have
to avoid unilateral acts that undermine trust.

Earlier today in Saudi Arabia, Albright
urged wealthy Arab states to cut olf ﬁnancial
aid to Islamic militants behind the bombings
in Israel.

BERLIN- The Pentagon eonﬁnns an Air
Force C-141 cargo plane is missing and pre-
sumed crashed in the South Atlantic.

AGe1man military plane with 24 peo
ple on board has also crashed in the South
Atlantic, off Angola German oﬂicials say
the two planes may have collided.

The Pentagon spokeswoman says U.S.
officials are checking that report.

The spokeswoman says the American
plane was ﬂying from Namibia toAscension
Island yesterday. There were nine crew
members on board

The plane was based at McGuire Air
Force Base, New Jersey.

Don't throwyour life away for beer

Jennifer

Activities fee is students’
money, not SGB’s

It is a conﬂict of interest, and it must be changed.

Student government takes money from the same activi-
ties fund as other student organizations. They also decide
how the funds are allocated. It is a bad idea to let the cat
guard the mice.

Activities funding, which comes from the activities fee
attached to every student’s tuition, is controlled by the stu-
dent government, which doesn’t hold itself to the same stan-
dards that other student groups adhere to.

For example, student groups are not allowed to use activ-
ities funding for t-shirts or concerts. Student government uses
the money for both of these purposes. SGB members claim
that it’s for the good of the students, that they should be
above the rules. ,

. That’s wrong. Every student here has been personally
insulted by this ﬁasco.

If it is going to do the University’s work, deciding how
to allocate funds to student groups, then student government
cannot have an interest in that money for itself.

SGB should be given an operating budget each year or.

semester, just like any University department. Once it has its
budget, SGB can do with it as it pleases (though of course,
members should be ready to defend how it was spent when
they go requesting another budget next semester). When
there is a system of checks and balances, there is no conﬂict
of interest. V

Only once student govemment’s hand is out of the cook-
ie jar can the organization responsibly and objectively feed
the student groups who deserve that funding.

, _We would like to think that college students are mature
enough to handle the responsibility of allocating activities
funding properly. But when tl1at’s not the case, they should
have to answer to somebody.

It is not in the students’ interest to have their activities fee
misused. Students are not helped because an SGB president
took a plane to stay in a four-star hotel in Philadelphia instead
of a bus to a Motel 6 like every other group would have to.

We are not. saying that SGB members should not be
allowed to do these things, but they should not have ﬁnal say
about how the money is used -— not when it’s the students’

’ money.
The king has to be answerable to the people.

Many Pitt students, are
much more enthusiastic
about hitting the beer than
about hitting the books.
Since the day they arrived on
campus, it’s been a continu-
ous party, one that seemingly
will last until graduation. In
the meantime, classes are a
mere technicality. Whether
graduation day is a semester
away or four whole years
ahead, problems are bound
to interfere with this hedo-
nist plan. Maybe not right
away, but eventually these
students are going to get a
rude awakening. One much
more severe than a killer
hangover. ’ ,

Orientation not only wel-

comes students to their place.

at the University, but it also
welcomes them to the party
scene. There is no shortage
of parties, and many take
advantage of the open invita-
tions. Now, I’m not going to
be a parent and lecture about
what we as college students
should and should P not
involve ourselves in during
orientation, or anytime for
that matter. We all have dif-
ferent philosophies of life,
but, hopefully, we also all
have dreams. We wouldn’t
be here if we didn’t. Those
dreams can be shattered

when the carefree attitude of —

the beginning of the semes-
ter lasts too far into the

semester.
As a freshman, I’ve been
hit right smack in the face

with the newfound freedom
that college offers. Increased
independence, no more
parentally—enforced cur-
fews—we all know the list.
After attending classes, it
has also become obvious to
me that it’s all in our hands.
Our success or failure rests
completely with ourselves. If
we choose to not read a

“Everything in moderation,”
though very_ cliched, fits this
situation perfectly. ‘

Many students just do
not realize how deep a hole
they have dug for themselves

Christian Coalition is all form and no substance

Michael Berquist

Columnlst

This past surmner, Ralph Reed
announced his resignation as Director from
the Christian Coalition, a political group
founded from the ashes of Rev. Pat
Robertson’s failed run at the presidency in
1988. In the years since, it has earned the
respect of the entire Washington D.C. politi-
cal community. In 1994 it was credited with
supplying the muscle that elected a majority
of Republicans to Congress. But it is ironic
that for all of the praise the Coalition has gar-
nered from the media and for all of the
Republican party’s adherence to its agenda,
the Coalition has proven itself to be a
remarkably weak organization. The
Coalition, for example, has claimed a mem-
bership of 1.9 million members, but U. S.
Postal Service records put its real strength at
just 300,000. In terms of raw political mus-
cle, the Coalition has shown itself to be a

paper tiger.

Consider, also, the Coalition’s meddling '

in the 1996 re-election campaign of Senator
John Warner. Senator Warner, a mainstream
conservative from Virginia who voted with
the Coalition 71 percent of the time in 1994,
was running in the Republican primary for
re-election to his Senate seat, which he has
held since 1978. His foe in the primary was
enthusiastically supported by the.Coalition
for his complete support for its agenda.

On typical Coalition “voter guides,”
Warner and his opponent would be evenly
matched. They agreed on all ten issues pri-
marily used on voter guides. However, in an
unsubtle move to stack the deck against
Warner, the Coalition‘ substituted two minor
issues on which he disagreed with them in
the guide. The inference was pathetically
obvious: vote for Warner’s opponent.
Ironically, Warner went on to win the prima-
ry anyway, a testament to the Coalition’s
lackofstrength.Intheprimaryofapartythat
it supposedly controlled (according to the
media), and in a region of the country where
its power is strongest, it utterly failed to
unseat a politician who had dared to have the
courage to disagree with it. T'hat’s not good.

This summer, despite China’s persecu-
tion of members of the Christian faith, the
Christian Coalition was oddly silent during

V the debate over whether to revoke China’s '
Most-Favored-Nation trading status. Why?

Because Pat Robert_son’sextensive business
holdings would be greatly affected if
Congress voted to repeal MFN. I guess the
Coalition only presses its agenda when it
does not clash with Robertson’s business
interests. A

InMayof1992Reedproposedaten-
point “Contract with the American Farnil ”,

legislation that became pet-projects for

has led people to assume
that all voters with a

Will the 1998 elections mark the end of

teenager luring equally rancid

teenagers with tacky promotions.
And then, there’s Dave Thomas,
owner of Wendy’s.

Dave Thomas, when all is said
and done, is as charismatic as an

old shoe. This is just as well,

because Wendy’s food tastes that
way. He also happens to be quite
vain and conﬁdent and noticeable
due to his constant appearances on
Wendy’s advertisements. He

‘ assumes consumers will ﬂock to

buy his substandard slop because
instead of having special-effect
laden commercials, playroorns and
cheesy competitions, he has corn-

mercials featuring himself as
everyone’s favorite “Uncle Dave.”

The fatal ﬂaw inihis reasoning is.

that Uncle Dave is an annoying old

the sake of trying to appeal to
America’s youth. As I mentioned
before, he hitched on to the cl1ick—

McDonald’s has basketball stars

take a moron to foul up a piece of

What’s more, it doesn’t go through

seems crispy, odd in a fast-food
world where soggy is the norm.

be Gregor Samsa, the main protag-

In conclusion, I’ll be fair and
say Wendy’s is one of the better
fast food restaurants, but that’s like
having a favorite turd (“You know,
I really liked last Thursday’s soft

to herd Uncle Dave and a small
group of his irlcsome Wendy’s
employees together and throw
them onto rush—hour Bigelow

Commitment is the key to lasting relationships

Ramesh

Reddy

The transition from high
school to college is a challenge
by itself without having to deal
with broken relationships along
the way. When broken relation-

ships occur, they usually affect

the student’s academic perfor-
mance and health, as well. Why
is it so difﬁcult to keep a rela-
tionship going?

This may be the case

. because too many relationships

are based on superﬁcial attrac-
tion. ’
Love that is based solely on

‘outward beauty will not last

because outward beauty will
eventually fade away. Love that
is based on inner beauty can

‘ last forever. I am talking about

love from the heart.

It is important to be com-
pletely committed to the one
you say you love or fell in love

with. Maybe you fell in love

because you were attracted to
the other person’s appearance;
maybe you fell in love because

the other person exhibited
behavior or characteristics that
you admired. Whatever the rea-
son, commitment is the key.
There will always be some-
one more attractive or who has
qualities that are lacking in the
person you are with. This
should not break the comrnit-
ment of love between you two.
There is no guarantee that
you will be happy with the next
person you choose. There could
come another person who sur-
passes the qualities of the first
orsecond. It is hard to be happy
when there is no contentment. :
Statistics show that 50 per-
cent of marriages end in
divorce. If you think these are
inﬂated statistics, think again.
Statistics also show that 60 per-
cent of second marriages, 70
percent of third marriages and
90 percent of fourth marriages
end in divorce. I believe the
reason is that if a person cannot
be committed to his or her ﬁrst
marriage or ﬁrst relationship, it
will be that much more difﬁcult

to be committed in future rela-

provides the opportunity for the
two of you to be together, do
you show gratitude to God by

the same-way you did the ﬁrst

If you break a
relationship
for selﬁsh rea-
sons, I believe
the next rela-
tionship won’t
be any better
because there
is no true love
and commit-
ment.

believe that Jesus’ love for us

kind, never jealous or envious,

- never boastful or proud, never

haughty or selﬁsh or rude. Love
does not demand its own way. It
is not irritable or touchy. It does
not hold grudges and will hard-

him no matter what the cost.
You will always believe in him,
always expect the best of him,

You see, Promise Keepers has but
one purpose: to encourage
Christian men to live up to their
responsibilities as husbands,
fathers and church leaders, which
women say they want anyway.
That the National Organization for
Women is sponsoring a counter-

ply makes no sense to me.

that the Pirates would surprise the

even I wasn’t prepared for their

his proposal for an eastern all-

enough yet? We’ve all heard the rou-
tine a million times, yet nothing
seems to ever penetrate some col-
lege students’ thick skulls.

Some graduates look back on
their college days and reminisce
about their friends, remarkable pro-
fessors, sporting events, classes and
even the occasional party. But, there

» are just as many who don’t make it.

The only retrospection they go
through is regret. They fooled
around too much, too long, and now
they’re paying the price. In college,
you are paying thousands of dollars
to get a‘ higher education, not to get
high. But the wasted money is small
and trivial in comparison to all that
is lost while some are busy getting
wasted. .

We all know what goes on
around campus and where we can go
to have a good time. We also know
how important our time is right now.
Now, locking oneself in one’s dorm
room and studying non-stop is not

would think. One—dimensional peo-
ple do not succeed in today’s world.
We have to keep that in mind. Just as
hermit students won’t come out on
top in the long run, chronic partiers
will not magically find themselves
on the dean’s list unless they have
hidden powers. Good for them if
they do. But the rest of us must fol-
low the path to our futures in a more
conventional way.

These are supposed to be some
of the best years of our lives. So,
let’s have a good time but be serious,
too. Our classes can enlighten us,
our friends can teach us invaluable
lessons, but too much of a good
thing can really hurt you in the end.
Take it easy and keep your priorities
in check. Our futures are riding on
them. But for now, have fun, and

above all, don’t let anything get in

the way of your dreams.

fun, just against blowing the rest of

Panther football  

is back to
respectability

All of you freshmen Pitt fans proba-
bly don’t appreciate what’s happening
here.

Take it from me, this is not Pitt foot-
ball as we upperclassmen have come to
know it. This is actually exciting, compet-
itive football. ~

_In recent years, it has been a forgone
conclusion among the. majority of stu-
dents on this campus that Pitt would get
spanked heading into virtually every
game.

On those rare occasions of a Pitt win,’
the prevailing campus attitude was not,
“Yeah, we won!,” ‘it was, “Boy, Temple
must really, really suck.”

Last year was about as bad as it gets.

‘ Pitt was out—scored 430-214 overall and .

342-55 in its seven losses, which were
matched by only four wins.

When the new football regime featur-
ing Head Coach Walt Harris and Athletics
Director Steve Pederson took over last-
year, it couldn’t promise an immediate
improvement in the team’s win-loss

record. Only so much could be expected .

from a program that had fallen so far from
grace and simply did not have the number
of truly talented players necessary to
compete. P

. What the new administration could
do is promise a new attitude and attempt
to generate interest in the program so that
it might, on some far-off day, reach a
respectable level once again.

The buzz surrounding Pitt football
this year is almost incomparable to last
year’s. The new logo and uniforms have
been tremendous successes. It’s so

,_ refreshing to actually see fellow students

wearing Pitt football garb and talking
about the team while walking the streets
of Oakland. -

Clearly the off-the-ﬁeld goal of
sparking public interest has been met. But
surprise, surprise! If this early part of the
season is any indication, respectability is
already at hand for the Panthers.

Now don’t get me wrong, the
Panthers are nowhere near the point that
the coaches, players or fans ultimately
hope they will reach. They are 2-1, with
their most impressive performance being
the loss to the top-ranked Penn State
Nittany Lions.

True, the Panthers’ 35-24 win over
Houston on Saturday wasn’t exactly what
you’d call pretty. But it’s the good football
teams who can have an off-day and still

Last-second pick saves Pitt  

Chiffon Allen's interception seals first road win in four years

Geoff Moak

Staff Writer

It wasn’t pretty, but you won’t
hear the Pittsburgh Panther football

team complaining about Saturday’s

35-24 win at the University of
Houston. «

Pitt’s special teams played as
though they tried to give the game
away. Hank Poteat fumbled a punt
return early in the game to set up a
Cougar touchdown. Grant Coffield
had four punts, each for 30 yards or
less.

The Pitt offense also appeared to
try to give the game away by stalling
out and punting nine times in the
game.

The defense must have tried to
give the game away, allowing two dif-
ferent Houston tailbacks, Ketric
Sanford and Vaughn Inniss, to rush for
over 100 yards each.

In the end, it would be the
Cougars who would give the game
away.

The game started out quietly
enough. On Houston’s second posses-
sion, Pitt’s Emest Coakley forced a
fumble that set up —a 24-yard touch.-

down pass from Pete Gonzalez to’

Terry Murphy to put% the Panthers up 7-
0. V

The Cougars punted on their next
possession, but Pitt return man Hank
Poteat fumbled. Poteat’s fumble led

directly to a Houston touchdown and
indirectly to a long dry spell for Pitt.
Two Sebastian Villarreal ﬁeld goals
built Houston’s lead up to 13-7. An 11-
yard swing pass to Billy West 1:20
before halftime gave Pitt a 14-13 lead
at the break. A

The Pitt offense came out on fire
in the second half. Led by a 44-yard
Dwayne Schulters run,‘ the Panthers

e hy (#81) hauled in Pitt’s first touchdown of rs ge. A

marched 80 yards in 1:30 for a touch-
down to go up 21-13. Pitt’s offense
then went dormant for the rest of the
game, managing just 74 more yards in
the contest. . 4

Pitt’s defense continued to wilt
under the Texas sun. The heat and
humidity, combined with the attack of

Sobo|eski,Murphy among Pitt’s unsung heroes

Rachel Lenzi
Staff Wrlter

Anyone who watched
Pitt’s wild and wooly
comeback. victory on
Saturday certainly
noticed ‘the outstanding

_ performances by quarter-

back Pete Gonzalez and
running back Dwayne
Schulters. ’

. Gonzalez, making his
seventh collegiate start,
went 12 for 24 with 151
yards en route to the 35-
24 victory.

Schulters rushed for
87 yards, returned two
kickoffs for 59 yards and

averaged almost six yards

per run.

Once again, simply
outstanding.

But Schulters and

Gonzalez can do that all
the time and it’s still their
job to do so. ‘-
Did anyone, however,
catch Billy West in
action? Does the name
Jason Soboleski have any
significance to Panther
fans? And what about
Terry Murphy, the junior
college transfer from Los
Angeles who showed up
from the middle of
nowhere? V‘
It wasn’t the heat that
drove the Panthersto do

better. .It. was. simply the

effort given by the sec-
ondary players that solid-
ified the second victory of
the season.

Billy West, the .1994
Big East Player of the
Year, has hidden behind
Schulters for most of last
season and the beginning
of this season. Since suf-
fering a season-ending

_ injury in 1995, West has-

n’t been able to recreate
the magic that went into
running 1,358 yards in
‘94. He got his licks in,
however, on Saturday,
creating several scoring
opportunities and even
scoring Pitt’s first go-

ahead touchdown near the

end of. the first half.

The key to playing
Billy West effectively?
Let Schulters run the ball
and camp West in the end
zone. (Remember the
final touchdown in the
53-52 win over Temple?)
It was West on a swing
pass, not a run, that gave
Pitt the early lead.

Although academic
pursuits conﬂict with
West’s senior season, (he
has to miss practice twice
a week to continue ‘his
studies in. civil and envi-
ronmental engineering),
he still rises to the occa-
sion. Don’t forget about

Panther freshman ‘Brittany Vivian (#6) fends ofa Notre Dame attacker in Friday's contest.

Red Storm, Irish rough up Lady Panthers

Shannon Heim

For The Pltt News
,It was a clear, sunny
day _ in downtown
Pittsburgh on Sunday. The
mood at the Sewickley

Academy however, was not

as _ light for the Lady

Panther soccer team.
Pittsburgh lost a tough

game yesterday to the Saint

-John’s Red Storm. The

Panthers only goal in the 4-
1 defeat was scored by
midfielder Charity
McClure during the first
half of the game. It was the
team’s first goal after three
straight shutouts ‘ - two
losses and a scoreless tie.
The Panther offense,
despite the one-goal show-
ing, had tremendously
improved over its 5-0 loss
to the Notre Dame Fighting
Irish on Sept. 12. In that
game, Pittsburgh attempted
only two shots on goal.
During Sunday’s battle,
however, Lady Panther
shots totaled 13. The lead-
ing shot makers, who each
made three attempts, were
freshmen Charity Kriley,
Mec§Clure,. .and so homore

1.

Megan Beasley.

While. the result was
worse than expected, the
Pitt-Notre Dame game
began with much hope and
anticipation for the
Panthers when Beasley
made an impressive direct
shot on goal during the
game’s first five minutes.

The shot was stopped,
however, by Notre Dame’s
sophomore goal keeper,
LaKeysia Beene. She
would face only one other
shot the entire evening.

Pittsburgh’s defense
also seems to be improving
with each game. During its
battle with the Red Storm,
Panther defenders permit-

‘ted only 11 shots to be

attempted on goal.
In its loss to Notre

,Dame, the Panther defense

was the key weakness. It
allowed the Fighting Irish
offense to make 37 shots on

goal.

those shots to penetrate in
the loss. Goalie saves tal-
lied 16.

During Ravich’s play- _

ing time, she stopped four
Fighting Irish shots and
allowed no goals to be
scored.

The rebuilding season
has just begun for this
young team. They are less
than one-quarter into the

1997 season, with 16
games remaining.
The next challenge

awaiting them comes on
Sept. 19, when they will

travel to the University of

California at Irvine 'Nike
Invitational.

There they will take on
UCI at 7:00 p.m. The Lady
Panthers will remain at the
Nike Invitational until
Sept. 21 when they will
battle Oregon State.

game on Oct. 8, battling

For The Pitt News

The men’s soccer team
gained a huge road victory
Saturday by defeating the
Providence Friars 4-1.
Sophomore midfielder Phil
Matilla led the Panthers,
scoring two goals in the Big
East win — the team’s sec-
ond of the year in the confer-
ence.

Matilla put Pittsburgh on
the scoreboard first at 17:44

ing his own rebound past the

“The win was also big
for us because we defeated a
Providence team that had

just beaten 23rd-ranked
Connecticut,” added
Luxbacher.

Pitt is undefeated this
season, with a 3-0-2 record
overall and a 2-0-1 mark in
the Big East. Providence
dropped its record to 1-3
overall and 1-3 in the Big
East. On Saturday, Sept. 20

“We

our chances. It was a good
win for us.”

The Friars made it 2-1 at
the end of the first half with
a goal from Andrew
McConville on a direct kick.
But it would be their last, as
the Panthers took control of
the second half.

Matilla scored again at
the 54:03 mark, giving Pitt a
commanding 3-1 lead. Then
freshman midfielder Brian
Baleno put the icing on the
cake with a goal midway
through the second frame.
Both second-half goals were
assisted by Jason Piombino.

from a scramble in front of

' Pitt quickly added two

the Sanford and Inniss duo,
helped keep Pitt’s defense on
the ﬁeld for 38:13 and sent
three Pitt defenders, Curtis
McGhee, Tray Crayton, and
Ernest Coakley, to the locker
room for intravenous ﬂuids
during the game.

“We got worn down.

They’re a big team. They have .

a lot more bodies,” said Pitt
Head Coach Walt Harris. “Plus,
[Sanford] is really a tremen-
dous football player. He
showed that today.” T '
Houston got one more field
goal on the board in the third

. quarter, then added a touch-

down and an important two-
point conversion early in the
fourth to take a 24-21 lead.
Midway through the fourth
quarter, the game eventually
gotmore interesting than Carl
Lewis’ ﬁnal race, which was
part of the halftime show.

A Grant Coffield punt
pinned Houston on its own 10-
yard line, still nursing the
three-point lead with 7:01 to

play. On the second play of the
series, Pitt’s Jason Soboleski
knocked the ball loose from
Ketric Sanford. The ball rolled
into the end zone, where it was
picked up by Phil Clarke for a
touchdown to put Pitt up 28-24.

That meant Pitt’s weary

defense had to stay on the ﬁeld
with lots of time for the
Cougars to drive and score.
- And drive they did.
Houston marched 64 yards
down the ﬁeld to _Pitt’s 16-yard
line. From there, quarterback
Jason McKinley threw for the
end zone and was intercepted
in the corner by Darnell
Dinkins. .

All the Panther offense had
to do was get one ﬁrst down
and run out the remaining three
minutes on the clock. But
Houston’s defense held ﬁrm,
forcing a punt and getting one
last shot at a win.

The Cougars drove at will

again, down to that fateful 16- V

. yard line, again.

A This time, Houston’s other
quarterback,‘ Tyson Helton,
threw an interception. Chiffon
Allen picked off the pass on his

THE PITT NEWS

_own three-yard line and ranit
97 yards the other way for a
touchdown to seal the game.

“I remember Coach saying
‘watch the slant’, so I was
thinking he’s going to run the
slant. I just stepped underneath
him and the ball was there,”
Allen said.

Defensive Coordinator
Larry Coyer was proud of his
squad after the game.

“I don’t think we were very
pretty. We just outfought them.
"You can’t buy that type of
courage,” Coyer said.

It’s too early for Panther -

fans to book ﬂights to bowl
games, but it’s no secret that
this was an important win. It
was Pitt’s ﬁrst road win since
November 20, 1993. More
importantly, the Panthers found
a way to win a close game that
they very easily could have
lost.

“The team I saw a year ago A

probably wouldn’t have won
this game,” said Harris. “You
can sense that this team has
more motivation. There’s
chemistry going on. They want
to be a different team.”

him.

Jason Soboleski, whose
greatest claim to fame is
that he won a national
championship at Berwick
High School with Notre
Dame’s Ron Powlus, man-
aged to place himself on the
map with a tackle on
Houston star tailback Ketric
Sanford. R

And Soboleski’s wasn’t
just any ‘tackle, mind you. It
was a tackle that ultimately
resulted in Pitt’s final go-
ahead tally, which was
scoopedgup in the end zone
by Phil Clarke.

How ironic that
Soboleski wasn’t even sup-
posed to touch the grass this
season. Walt Harris’ gamble
on the fifth-year senior paid
off.

Soboleski made the big
tackle and stepped out of
Powlus’ shadow and onto
Saturday night’s highlight
reels, even if it was only for
a few brief seconds. People,
tend to notice those reels,

lines or leaping over the

This season, the “new
attitude” is rubbing off on
everyone from the coaches
to the fans to the second-
and third-team players.
Including West, Soboleski
and Murphy. \

The moral of the story
on Saturday: There is no

a

FROM PAGE 11

win.

If you ask me, Pitt has
already reached the “respectable”
plateau and now can concentrate
on reaching “good” status.

One advantage Pittsburgh
has in its quest to become “good”
is the conference in which they
play. The Big East appearsto be
surprisingly weak this season —
good news for Panther fans.

Prior to -the start of the sea-
son, the “experts” in the media
ﬁgured the Big East would be a
two-team race between Miami
and Syracuse, with West
Virginia, Virginia Tech and
Boston College battling for the
bowl bids available to the third
and fourth place ﬁnishers.
Conventional wisdom said that
Pitt, Temple and Rutgers would
suck as usual.

.But-three weeks into the sea-
son, the picture of bragging rights
within the conference is very
cloudy.

Syracuse — Donovan
McNabb and his fellow
Orangemen are just 1-3 follow-
ing Saturday’s embarrassing 31-3
loss to Virginia Tech, and are no
longer even in the nation’s top
25.

Miami —— The Hurricanes,
1-1, have also sputtered.
Although they were ranked 13th

heading into Saturday’s action,
they fell to 24th ranked Arizona
State at home. This loss should
drop Miami’s place in the rank-
ings signiﬁcantly and makes
Thursday’s game against Pitt
pretty interesting.

Virginia Tech The
Hokies are probably the early
surprise of the conference. Their
2-0 record includes a win over
preseason conference favorite
Syracuse and has earned them a
No. 22 ranking, which should
rise when this week’s polls come
out.

Boston‘ College — When
BC lost to peremiial doormat
Temple last week, everyone ﬁg-
ured the Eagles would man" the
bottom spot in the Big East this
season. But then they turned
around and shocked West
Virginia on ‘Saturday, evening
their record at 1-1.

West Virginia — The
Mountaneers feature the nation’s
second-ranked rusher in Amos
Zereoue but lost to Boston
College on Saturday -— the same
Boston College squad that lost to
Temple a week earlier. WVU is
2-1, but exactly how good they
are remains a big question.

Temple — After the Owls

upset Boston College last week,
it appeared as though they ﬁnally
improved and might win another
game or two in the "Big East this
year. This. week’s 52‘-10 embar-

rassment at the hands of Penn
State reminded us that Temple is

‘ still Temple.

Rutgers — Sucks._ Some
things don’t change. A

Pitt stayed relatively close to
Penn State, Penn State killed
Temple, Temple beat Boston
College and Boston College beat
West Virginia. Does -this mean
Pitt is now the team to beat in the
Big East?

No, but it does mean that the
Panthers have a realistic chance,
at thevery least, of competing in
every one of their conference
games. That translates into a
chance at securing.one of the top
four spots in the Big East and the
bowl.

Bear this in mind: The
fourth-place team in the Big East
is guaranteed a bowl as long as
that team has at least six wins.

Pitt has a very realistic shot
at going to a bowl this season,
and while it’s probably too early
to even start talking about that
now, the fact that it is even a pos-
sibility is a remarkable achieve-
ment and a testament to the
accomplishments of the new
football administration.

Brian Knavish is a columnist for
The Pitt ‘ News and reminds
everyone that The St. Jude
Liberty Bowl will take place in
Memphis Tennessee on Dec., 31.
