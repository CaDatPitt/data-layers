Poliey Limits Major Studentsponsored Concerts f A

’ By MARY KANE
__Pitt News staff Writer

Black Week and Greek-Engineer
Weeks. are the only two occasions
when student groups can sponsor
major concerts, according to a new
major concert policy developed by
the Office of Student Activities.

The policy states that except for
these two occasions, the Pitt Pro-

gram Council (PPC)~ has the “sole ,

responsibility for programming 'ma-
jor concerts. ‘ ‘

Maj or concerts are defined by the
policy‘as “all concerts held off cam-
pus and those concerts held on cam-
pus ‘where total costs exceed
$5000.” . ‘

Martin also noted that the
. amount of aid available to eligible
students has increases dramatically
thanks to efforts of the offices of
student aid, student affairs, and ad-
missions.

- In regards to the suture and.

enrollment, Martin confessed that
Pitt’s varied programs, especially in-
health schools, will continue to
serve as “an attractive avenue for
students.”

As the “appropriations crisis”
lingers on, the administration con-
tinues to “work closely with the

state legislature” and search for-

solutions, to resolve the crisis, he
said. ' 3

According to Martin, one solu-
tion theadministration is examinig
involves changing the university’s

,, funding category from non-

preffered. Another possibility is
changing the allocation system. In-
stead of a yearly or annual ap-
propriation to the university, the
state would make a_ larger allocation
that would be used over a five-year
period. ' , " - T

What’s good for one is _good for all, or so the story
should read when speaking of passing out precious
student activities fee monies. _ A ,

But, with the announcement on Thursday of a
new programming policy by Director of Student Ac-
tivities, Andy Smith, there seems to be some
noticable exceptions to this rule.

‘Under the new policy, onlythe Black Action Socie—' E

ty and the sponsors of the Greek/Engineers’ Week,
festivities would be permitted to supplement the Pitt

—./

(with a major concert being defined as any concert
held off campus'7or exceeding $5,000 in costs).
They are being permitted to do after having set a
precedent in programming successful concerts, refer-
ing to the fact that in_ the past only these two groups
have sponsored crowd drawing, money-making’ con-
certs. "  ' ' - *
It seems unfair that-the Black Action Society, the
Greeks and the Engineers are permitted to program
their own concerts, while members ‘of the other
governarice e.g. the Nursing Student Organization
and Resident Student Association are not even given
theichance to ‘prove themselves as competent pro-
grammers. ' 0' 
Smith said that the SGB does not have the type of

" funding to experiment with would-be programmers

\

to see if they are competent at their work. —

We might take this opportunity to remind Smith
and -‘other members of the student activities office
that, althoughtstudent organizations must be finan-
cially sound,‘ these groups are also supposed to be
educational vehicles giving the stude\nts the oppor-

-groups. If the need for such learning opportunities

did not exist there would be no need for Smith or his

position. I
We believe it should not be the job of Smith or any

other Pitt administrator to chose which student-

groups will be given the chance to learn from.‘pro-
gramming their own concerts and which groups will
not be afforded this opportunity. 7 g ‘

In this case it is a case of all or nothing, either giv-

ing all the governancegroups at least one opportuni-
ty to program concertsor not giving any of them the
chance to perform this function.
\‘ According to the policy statement the Pitt Pro-
gram Council is supposedly the sole source of concert
programming on the Pitt campus.iIf this is true then
only the council concern themselves with concert pro-
gramming. . '. _ -

If this policy is not to be adhered to, then Smith
along with his staff should sit down and reasses the
present system, altering it to include funding for all

governance groups, the group that represent the '

largest interest of students on the Pitt campus.

Changer Proposed For Funding of Sta’re’Re|ateld Schools

 

 

(Editor's note: this column was
written in reponse to an invitation

A by The ---Pitt News for’ State
. Representative Ron Cowell to com-
V ment on House Bill 158)

I appreciate your invitation to

, comment about legislation which I

have -introduced in the Penn-
sylvania House of Representatives
to change the constitutional status
of appropriations to the four state-
related universities in Pennsylvania.

. On February 7, 1979, I introduced
House Bill 158. This legislation pro-
poses a constitutional amendment
that would permit the ap-

. propriatons for ‘the four state-
‘ related schools to be considered as a

part of the General Appropriations

Bill rather than each as a separate

rion-preferred appropriations bill.
If adopted, this legislation would

I '. have several positive impacts for the

schoolsaffected.
1. The schools’ appropriation -

‘would no longer require two-

thirds approval in the House

I ‘and Senate. Rather, the ap-

propriations would be part of

5 the---General Appropriations Bi_ll
" which ‘requires only a constitu-

tional majority in each chamber. 
2. The inclusion-of this fun- .

‘ A ‘ ‘ding in the General Appropria-

tions Bill would give due

‘recognition to -the state-related

 schools as an integral part of the q

-‘ ‘Commonwealth’s system of

h'igh._er education, rather than
_" treating ‘ them as step-children
~.wh‘o ‘can 8??‘ What ‘is leftover

 

after the General Appropria-
tions ‘Bill is adopted.

3. This would eliminate the
“hostage situation” in which
the General Assembly has spent
all or most of thetavailable state
revenues on the General_Ap-
propriations Bill and then
argued that there were insuffi-
cient funds available to finance
legislation for the nonpreferred
appropriations including the
state-related schools. The
system by which the university
communities are held hostage is
not only unfair, but inherently
contributes to instability in the

' university because of the uncer-

tainty about available funding,
necessary’ tuition rates, and
resources available for faculty
salaries, etc. _ » '

4. The current situation. pro-

vides a huge loophole in the‘

Legislature’s constitutional
obligation to adopt a balanced
budget. Too frequently, the
Legislature spends all available

revenues on general appropria- , .

tions but provides noth- ing for
the non-preferreds unless there
is a fee or tax increase. In such a
‘case, the ~ Legislature has
technically adopted a balanced
budget, but in fact hasleft ama-

jor portion of our real obliga-

tions unfunded. House Bill 158 ‘
would close this loophole and

end this practice.

5. Whenever the hostage game
is played, higher education .in- __ “I

   

evitably gets blamed to some ex-
tent for whatever tax or fee in-
creases are required to fund the
non-preferreds...This is true even
in years such as l977_when the
state-related schools received
only the same amount they had i
received -in the prior year.
Friends“ of 0 higher education
already have . enough trouble
generating public and legislative
support for additional funding
for higher education. Public

4 support-certainly is further erod-

ed when the impression is
created that adequate funding '
for higher education necessitates
a tax increase. The system by
which higher education is un-
fairly blamed for these increases
ought-to be eliminated.

I recognize that some university
officials among our state-related

‘schools are concerned that this con-

stitutional change might result in
additional’ state control over their
institutions; But there is no
relationship ‘between the constitu-
tional amendment whichl have

proposed and _any additional state .

control. - ~ ,
First, the language of House Bill
158 simply addresses the question of
what can be included in the General
Appropriations Bill. House Bill I58
only adds the appropriations for
state-related schools to this
category.‘ No mention is ‘made
about the .management__of these in-
stitutions. ~ '- A - A

   

Second~,-these university officials:

who have this concern ignore the
fact that if the Legislature truly
wanted to exert more control, we
could do so now simply by amen-
ding the enabling legislation which
created the state-related status for
. t_he several institutions. The Legisla-
tion could make these amendments
,now without changing the constitu-
tional status of the schools ap-

. propriations and we could make

current funding contingent upon
the schools’ acceptance of such
amendments to give the state more
control. But no such effort ‘has been
undertaken and none has been
seriously discussed.

Finally, House Bill «158 is a con-

stitutional amendment which would -

require passage by .two sessions of
the Legislature and be approved by
the public through a referendum
question. I believe that the
legislative and public_debate that
would occur during the process of
considering and adopting House
Bill 158 could clearly establish the
intent that no additional state con-
trol is intended as a trade-off for

changing the constitutional status
of the schools’-appropriations.

I have witnessed the hostage gim-
mick utilized from the perspective
of a Pitt student,’ a Pitt employee,
and now a state legislator. From all
perspectives, it appears to me that
the approach is unfair and irrespon-
sible. But the approach will pro-
bably be used periodically in the

future as it has been in the past .

when budget crises arise. It
therefore is very important for the
state-related schools and the Com-
monwealth as a whole that we pass
legislation similar to House Bill 158
at the earliest possible date. I hope

that the members of the university

communities that would be
positively affected by this change
will join during the next session of
the Legislature to argue in support
of this constitutional amendment.

  Panthers Face a Test in Lawrence, Kansas   

Much more should be known about Pitt’s football team after
tomorrow’s game with the Kansas Jayhawks in Lawrence. . -

Most of the questions looking for answers deal with the Panthers’

. offense, a_non-impressive entity in last week’s 14-6 defeat of Boston

College. Both flankers, Barry Compton and Larry Sims, are lost for

the season because of knee injuries, so freshman Dwight Collins will

be baptized tomorrow in- his first collegiate start, at a new position.

. Although it’s difficult to come up with any ‘positive impressions
over last Saturday’s win, closer inspection may enlighten the skep- ,
tics. Pitt did turn the ball over nine times, and still won. Many will
claim that Boston College was an ‘inept opponent. That point will
also be answered tomorrow when the Eagles play highly regarded
Stanford at Boston. ' S

Another cause for optimism was that Pitt’s defense was only about

T, " 75‘ percent in the opener. Tackle Greg 'Meisner missed the game,

' while middle guard Jerry Boyarsky andtackle Bill Neill hobbled

‘ around and played only in the first quarter and near game’s end,

when Pitt’s lead was anything. but stable. ,

_ \ _ But the close call could serve to bode well for Pitt the rest“ of the
season. The coaches, players, and even a few fans, found out that
pre-season ratings don’t mean a damn thing. Sports Illustrated’s poll
won't help the Panthers score touchdowns on Saturday. And the on-
ly time ratings mean anything is after the season.

With the shaky offense, Pitt is presently anything but a contender
for national honors. The tailback position is still uncertain, and no

- wide receiver has emerged as a legitimate deep threat, something Pitt
hasn’t had since the days of Matt Cavanaugh to Gordon J ones. i

Willie Collier and Julius Dawkins may have all the tools and
potential to become deep threats, but as some wise coach once
said,“Potential is just a nice way of saying he hasn_’t done anything
yet.” . g ' ‘ .

Th optimists will point to last season and note that Pitt struggled

_ against some of the weaker opponents, ’ but manhandled the ’
heavyweights, Washington and Penn State. That 'could happen
again, but as another Pittsburgh team found out this season, just
because so_mething_happened in the past doesn’t mean it will happen
again. . , ~ _

For the uninformed, the Pittsburgh Pirates (Chuck Tanner), filled_

' the papers with “Oh, we've always been a second half ball club, and
we're at our' best’ in September, and look at our record against the . ‘ / . \ . '

The mighty Panthers better stick to the old “Play them one at a " ' -

    Boofers.Gain Confidence for Slippery Rock

Roth Photo

‘By ANNA ARLOTTA A

Pitt News Sports Writer

’ With Wednesday’s 5-2 perfor-
, _'rnance over conference foe St. Vin-

cent, the Panther soccer team will
look with a great deal of optimism

to tomorrows important contest

with Slipperry Rock. _ .
’ The Pitt offense began looking
like a united group as the Panthers
put five goals past Kirk Drennan,
the Bearcat goalkeeper. ‘It was

' sophomore wing Eric Tiedtke that

played a tough, consistent game as
he recorded an assist on the first
goal by Bob Hughes and scored two
of his own in each half of play.
The Panthers opened scoring ear-
ly in the first half against the Bear-
cats when Tiedtke chippedxa ball to

.\

After putting in an exceptional high

‘school career in Ft. Worth, Texas,

_ is freshman year with the Panthers
was somewhat lacking in the kind ;‘
of goal scoring he was known for. ‘
In the past three games, he has
scored as many goals, and appears
to be‘ on his way to displaying" the
old Tiedtke style of play.’ ’

~ “The entire offense had a good‘
game,” said coach Leo Bernis, ‘.‘but
Ericwas the person that stood out,;
he put in a very good effort
throughout the game. -

Teammate Chris Richmond, who
goaled in the second —-half
agreed. “The offense as a whole
played exceptional,” said Rich-

mond, “'bu°t Eric was a step faster

P than everyone else.”

Following ‘the Hughes score in
the first half was a fine finish .by
senior midfielder Danny Hamm.
Hamm took a ball from teammate
Al Adelmann and shot from the 20
yard line, catching Drennan off
guard and putting the Panthers
ahead 2-0. Tiedtke’s first goal end-

ed the scoring at the half with Pitt .

on top 3-0.
Richmonds goal opened up the
second half with only four minutes

' into the period. That was followed

by a successful shot on goal from
St. Vincent’s Len »\Vincler. The
Bearcats looked as if they were

about to make a comeback when
Jose Oqueli put in another St. Vin-
cent goal to make the score 4-2 Pitt.
' The Panthers took over and ten
minutes. later Tiedtke moved the
ball all the way down field to score
his second time._ ~. -

“Our performance was not con-
sistent, it was rather'spotty,’2, said
Bemis. “On one hand I'was rather
disappointed that we didn't finish
some of our opportunities, but on
the other hand I realize that those
shots were taken by some young
players.

‘fWe played in bursts, and when
we burst we were very
successful,” added Bemis. “But I

did a good deal of substituting to
protect ‘ those that were
hurt.” Looking "towards the all-
important match with Slippery
Rock tomorrow, the Panthers will
try to keep on scoring those goals
while continuing to work on consi-
tant form. '

We’ve been jelling together of-
fensively and if we continue to do
so and be consistent at our play we
should have V a real successful
season,” said Tiedtke.

Slippery Rock, a Division I oppo-'

nent, will-be a prime opportunity to ,

show the Panthers as a complete
team. »

Tennis Team Strong for Eastern 8 Tourney

‘ forward Hughes’ Hughes Sue‘ ‘ By JOANNE BENTELER . He hopes that White will be seeded.

‘ cessfully headed the ball into the net college teams‘

number four singles, plays a strong

 

_ for the first Panther goal. Hughes,
‘as a freshman, proved to be_ a
serious scoring threat as he record-
ed 11 goals that year. Last year that
number, was drastically reduced to
one. With his play in the Panther
contests so far this season, Hughes
once again appears to have that
scoring touch back. .After an ex-
cellent indoor season with Pitt he
‘will be called upon for a nurnber of

" goals. ; »

Tiedtke‘, too, canfbe considered

At the Easter Eight Men's Tennis
Tournament this weekend, Pitt will
be strongly represented by four
returning lettermen and two return-

ing lettermen and two freshmen, all

of whom are right handed players.
Doug White, _a senior from

Reading Pa., will be playing

number one singles and number one

doubles with another senior, Rip 4

Wagner.‘ Wagner will be 'playing

number two singles. I .\

White playsan aggressive game, has
a strong serve, a good volley, good
overhead smashes, and likes to at-

tack the net.

“He has the qualities you need
for number one, especially in this
tournament,”said Dieffenbach. “lf
he._’s hot, it will be difficult to beat
hir'n.’\,’  '

Wagner is a very consistant
player with a strong ground stroke,
according to the ‘coach. ‘His success
in the tougrnament depends’“oi1 his‘

  

game using a lot of top spin. Harry
is a veteran and has experience play-
ing on a team. His strength is mov-
ing his opponent from corner to,
corner. Dieffenbach said. ‘

Senior Tony Calderone, playing
number six singles is “Mr. Hustle,”
according to Dieffenbach. He is a
fighter and _“has all the basic tools
to play a good game of tennis.”

The two‘ freshmen, Jeff Brand
and Mark Weinberg, are untested.

In last year's tournament," Pitt
finished fourth out of eight. The
team to beat this yeariwill be West
Virginia. They just pumped a con-
siderable amount of money into
their men’s tennis program, accor-

ding to the coach. They’ve acquired. _;

some top name players and built in-
door courts. Pitt’s team will have
intrasquad games until the end of
September..The main season does
not start until spring.’ The Eastern
