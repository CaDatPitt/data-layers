School year brings erseverance from Pitt students

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

This school year Pitt students
seized opportunities to get
involved and exercise some
control over the university and
community.

Students turned their efforts

Board elections; they supported
the environment by protesting
Mt. Graham and took time to
work with children at the Hand-
in-Hand festival.

The results?

Over $100,000 raised for
Pennsylvania Special Olympics,
an increased voter turnout for

had fun.

However, when looking back
at the year, some students were
involved with activities aimed at
having a negative impact on
others. Electronic mail was dis-
covered as a brand new way to
harass people, and students had
to be more careful with their

nizing messages across.

Even though more students
may have gotten involved on
campus this year, all students
were affected by circumstances
beyond their control. After
returning from winter break,
students often found themselves
watching the late news for those

ever threw their “hat in the ring”

Provost search
continues; one
to be named in

middle of May

By Frank Porco
Staff Writer

It was April 20, 1993, when Donald
Henderson announced to the university com-
munity his plans to resign from his position as
provost. .

Upon the announcement of Henderson’s
resignation, former Dean of the Law School
Mark Nordenberg was asked to step in and
fill his shoes as interim provost, and
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor announced a
committee to locate candidates who could fill
the position full time.

The hunt continues.

“One hundred and thirty-five people origi-
nally applied for the position,” said Mary
Louise Soffa, dean of the Graduate School
of Arts and Sciences, and chairperson of
the committee chosen to find the new
provost.

The committee is made up of a diverse col-
lection of university representatives, six mem-
bers of the University Senate, three students
from different groups on campus and eight
people whom Chancellor O’Connor nominat-
ed to the committee.

“We [the committee] have narrowed that list
down to about seven finalists,” she said.

The seven finalists include:

~David Caputo, Ph.D. — dean of the
School of Liberal Arts at Purdue University
and professor of political science.

-Robert Griffin, Ph.D. — dean of the
College of Arts and Humanities at the
University of Maryland at College Park and
professor of history.

-James D. Gunton, Ph.D. —— dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences at Lehigh

Afrocentric scholar discusses restoring culture

Byjohn B. Moore
Staff Writer

Students, faculty and others turned out last
night to hear Afrocentric scholar Na’im
Akbar speak about the importance of cultur-
al identity in the African-American commu-
nity.

Akbar, a clinical psychologist at Florida
State University in Tallahassee and author of
five books and over 25 articles, spoke in the
nearly full David Lawrence Hall Auditorium,
in a lecture sponsored by the African

Cultural Center.

“When I look at the self-destructiveness
that is risen among ourselves, when I look at
the self—sabotage, whereby we tear up things
faster than we build things up  said
Akbar. “I think that there is something basi-
cally wrong.”

Akbar said the African-American commu-
nity is not the only one plagued with drugs,
gangs, confusion in their leadership and
other similar problems, but the degree to
which it blankets and inhibits the growth in
that community suggests that there's an

unnatural process taking place.

That process, Akbar said, is an unnatural
set of circumstances that has arrested the
development of the African—American com-
munity.

“When I try to explain that arrested devel-
opment there are only a couple of things
that come to mind,” said Akbar. “What is it
that makes us different from every other
[culture] in America?  We are the only ones
here who have all come through a barbaric,
malformed, dysfunctional survival structure.”

increase
awareness
on campus

By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

In recent years, the issues of
crime and personal safety have
become more and more impor-
tant in many Americans’ minds.

Pitt’s Department of Public
Safety and Student Government
Board’s Public Safety
Committee have spent the past
year trying to raise awareness
of safety issues on the Pitt cam-
pus. V

According to Pitt Assistant
Director of Public Safety Gary
Moses, his departments major
goal throughout the past year
was to increase safety aware-
ness within the whole Pitt com-
munity.

“What we tried to do this year
was to reach out to the overall
university community,” Moses
said yesterday. “In the past
we’ve put a lot of emphasis on
the students, and we feel the
staff and faculty were not being
reached.”

Moses said Public Safety held
over 75 seminars for Pitt facul-
ty, staff and students within the
past year, along with several
new self-defense classes.

“Basically, we’re trying to
educate students, faculty and
staff what the Public Safety
department can provide to
them through various informa-
tion and these seminars.”

According to Moses, the safe-
ty seminars occasionally serve
to dispel rumors of a severe
lack of campus security.

“We find that rumors may
result in the perception that the
campus isn’t safe,” Moses said.
“We try to look at rumors and
answer whether they’re true or
not, and if they are, what they
can do about them.”

Moses said the number of
crimes reported in 1993 marked
a slight decrease from 1992.

University buildings open longer
durmgﬁnozls wee/efor students

By Raymond Belvin
For The Pitt News

Beginning April 23, the
Student Government Board’s
Public Safety Committee and
Pitt’s Department of Public
Safety will have several
overnight study areas around
Pitt’s campus available for stu—
dents’ use during finals.

According to Assistant
Director of Public Safety Gary
Moses, Scaife Hall, Hillman
Library, William Pitt Union and
Benedum Hall will all extend
their hours to have study space
available for students.

Benedum Hall will be open
from 9 a.m. to 4 a.m. The
William Pitt Union will be open
24 hours until April 26, when it
will return to normal hours of
operation. Hillman Library will

maintain normal hours but will
have increased security.
Benedum Hall will return to
normal hours on April 29. The
Cathedral of Learning will
remain open all night in accor-
dance with its regular hours.

In addition to the specially
extended hours of some facili-
ties, “Scaife isialways available
and usually has hours around
the clock,” Moses added.

According to Moses, Public
Safety plans to have guards
posted at all study areas. There
will also be campus police
patrolling the Bigelow Avenue
area.

“I believe we’ll have more
students at the Cathedral of
Learning and the William Pitt
Union [than at the other areasl,”
Moses said. “Forbes Quad will
be available but isn’t listed as

one of the safe spots, and I rec-
ommend the use of the safe
spots,” said Pat Catena, chair-
person of SGB’s safety commit-
tee.

According to Catena, after
Thursday, hours will be scaled
back at study areas, but not cut
off. At that time, “many study
areas become deserted,” he
added.

Pitt SGB has been running the
overnight study program for the
‘past year and a half. “We
haven’t had any problems, and
I feel this system is a benefit for
everyone,” Catena said.

According to Catena, trans-
portation will be available
to the various study areas
between the hours of 7 p.m.
and 3 a.m. These shuttles will
begin service April 24 and end
April 28.

SEAC to continue fight against Mt.
Graham as well as other causes

By Laura Gregory
For The Pitt News

Now that Pitt has officially
announced it won’t participate
in the Mt. Graham project,
the Student Environmental
Action Coalition must decide
where to_ focus its attentions in
the future.

But many coalition members
say the fight for Mt. Graham
isn’t over.

“We have won a battle, not
the war,” said SEAC member

Matt Peters.

He said the group intends to
keep working with other
activist organizations around
the country, as well as the SEAC
Southwest Division, to stop the
University of Arizona and
its partners in the project —
the Vatican and the Max
Planck Institute, a German sci-
entiﬁc contracting firm — from
following through with their
plans.

He said the movement for Mt.
Graham was successful in stop-

Pulitzer Prize author to
give graduation address

By Stephen Kozarovich
Asst. News Editor

Pulitzer Prize-winning
author and Pittsburgh native
David McCullough will
deliver the commencement
address at this year’s cere-
mony May 2. A

McCullough’s best—selling
biography of former
President Harry S. Truman
won the Pulitzer Prize last
year.

“His deep attachment to
this region and to the
Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania will add spe-
cial appeal and intimacy to
his address to the large
majority of graduating stu—
dents who were born and
raised in this area,” Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor said.

Born in Point Breeze and
educated at the local
Shadyside Academy,
McCullough is currently
working on the publication

of local philanthropist
Thomas Mellon’s memoirs
with the University of
Pittsburgh Press.

O’Connor will present

McCullough with an
Honorary Doctor of Letters
during the graduation

ceremonies, and for the first
time the activities will be
presented in real—time cap-
tioning.

Besides authoring several
books and winning numer-
ous awards, McCullough has
also hosted the award—win—
ning PBS series “The
American Experience” and
has narrated various docu-
mentaries including “The
Civil War” and “LBJ.”

“David McCullough is a
brilliant historian and biogra-
pher, as well as a highly
engaging speaker,”
O’Connor said. “His distin-
guished career serves as a
vivid example for the stu-
dents — and, indeed, for the
rest of us — to emulate.”

Students able to store
belongings tlo rough Pitt

By Daneen A. Goodlow
For The Pitt News

If you’re familiar with come-
dian George Carlin, you may
remember one of his funniest
routines about “stuff.” He
describes what things or pos-
sessions will qualify as “stuff”
and then says the next most
important issue is‘ a place to
keep your stuff.

Pitt students who find them-
selves with stuff can now take
part in a new service offered
this summer. Students no longer
have to go through the hassle of
packing up everything, taking it
with them, then bringing it right
back in the fall and unpacking.

Pitt is now offering the Pitt
University Storage for students
during summer months, as well
as throughout the year.

University Storage has sample
storage boxes in the Towers
along with brochures explain-
ing the summer storage service.
Pickup service is available.

They will also load and
unload and will provide
24-hour electronic security,
reasonable monthly rates and
one month free rent as part of
each full summer contract,
according to the brochure. Pitt
University Storage will also
store for longer periods of time.

UPMC offers traveler's clinic for community going abroad

By Chip Updegrove
For The Pitt News

A trip to a foreign land can be
an experience one never forgets.

The sights. The sounds. The
souvenirs. The sickness.

The sickness?

Traveling to a foreign country
can be hazardous to your health,
and for those venturing out of
the United States this summer,
the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center has something
for you.

It’s called the Traveler’s Clinic,
and it provides pre— and post—trip
medical consultation and tips on
how to avoid getting a disease
while traveling abroad.

Dr. Edward Wing, chief of
infectious diseases at UPMC, said
special medical precautions
should be taken by anyone trav-
eling to a developing country,
especially those in tropical
regions.

This includes many areas of
Africa and Asia, as well as
Central and South America.

Interested in working for The Pitt
News over the summer as a writer
or columnist, call Christine at 648-

7984 or stop by 434 WPU.

“It is important that people be
certain they have the appropriate
vaccinations before they travel,”
said Wing. “These may include
immunization for yellow fever,
polio and typhoid fever.”

Wing also said hepatitis is a
major problem in third-world
countries, and travelers headed
to that part of the world should
have themselves vaccinated for
the disease before they leave the
country.

People traveling to Japan,
Western Europe, Australia and

other developed countries need
not be as concerned, but should
be vaccinated anyway.

Wing said the most common
illnesses travelers would run into
are water-borne, like diarrhea.

Simple medical precautions
and having the right medication
around can prevent most prob-
lems.

Malaria, however, which is
common in the tropics, is a little
tougher to stop.

“Malaria is carried by mosqui-
toes,” Wing said, “and it is essen-

tial to wear the proper clothing
and use insect repellent, espe-
cially at dusk, when the mosqui-
toes that transmit malaria bite.”

The T raveler’s Clinic is held
every Monday from 1 to 4 p.m.
in the Falk Clinic, located on
Fifth Avenue in Oakland, and
will be conducted by medical
personnel from UPMC.

Services are not free, and the
charges will depend on what
treatment is required.

For more information on the
Traveler’s Clinic, call 648-6401.

Safety '-

Continued from page 1
According to Public Safety fig-
ures, 1,351 crimes were report-
ed last year, down from 1,562 in
1992 and 1,357 in 1991.

According to Moses, vandal-
ism incidents increased from
162 in 1992 to 227 last year.
However, assaults dropped
from 75 to 66 during the same
period.

Theft continued to be the
most commonly reported crime
on Pitt’s campus last year,
though incidences decreased
from 600 in 1992 to 547 in 1993.

“The majority of crimes occur
on the lower campus area 
it’s more populated and that’s
where the majority of thefts
occur,” Moses said. “Theft is the
highest crime on campus, and it
has been for a number of years.

“Everything else has basically
remained the same,” he said.

Pitt interim Director of Public
Safety Walter Waters said the
past year’s crime statistics
should serve as a sign of
encouragement.

“People are worried and con-
cerned about crime and that’s
Veiy good  but overall, crime
is not increasing in Pittsburgh,”
Waters said. “As the university
expands, our jurisdiction
expands, and if all things are
equal, our statistics should go
up, and that hasn’t happened.”

In addition to trying to raise
public awareness of security
issues, Moses said Public Safety
has been trying to increase offi-
cers’ presence in the Pitt com-
munity.

He said police cars are now
assigned to patrol north, central
and south sections of the cam-
pus, and beat patrols are also
being used.

“We also put beat officers out
in the streets, people who are
walking a beat so the students,
staff and faculty can see the
officers in various areas,” Moses
said.

In addition to officers walking

beats, some Pitt police began
patrolling the campus on moun-
tain bikes last month. Moses
said the new bike patrol system,
which involves two officers on
duty seven days a week, has
been working out quite well.

“We find out they’re getting
good reception from students,
staff and faculty,” Moses said.
-“From talking to the officers on
the bike patrol, they’re getting
stopped by a lot of people ask-
ing them how they’re doing and
handling things.

“We’ve also found [bike
patrols] are able to respond to
calls in high—traffic times, and
they’ve helped us alleviate
some problems because of
that,” he said.

Despite Public Safety’s
progress this past year, the
department is still looking for a
full-time director to replace

.-William Brennan. Waters has

been serving as interim director
since Brennan’s resignation in
March 1993.

Pitt Associate Vice Chancellor
for Business and Finance John
DeVitto said the search for
a permanent director is “extend-
ed and ongoing,” though the
position may be filled by mid-
July.

“We need a quality person
who wants to work and live in
the institution with the students,
faculty and staff,” DeVitto said.

“It’s a very time-consuming
process.”

Moses said Public Safety’s
lack of a permanent director
this past year has not hurt the
department’s operations.

“The department has been
operating very smoothly,”
Moses said. “We’ve continued
making changes, adapting new
policies and putting new pro-
grams in place.”

“Most departments would
become stagnant until a [direc-
tor] has been picked out, but
we’ve continued to move for-
ward,” Moses said.

According to SGB Public
Safety Committee Chair Patrick
Catena, his department has con-
tinued to make progress as well
within the last year.

Catena said the new lighting
near the Cathedral of Learning,
Hillman Library and other
places on campus has con-
tributed to a safer atmosphere
at Pitt.

“Probably the biggest step
we’ve taken [in the past year] is
the vastly improved lighting on
campus,” Catena said. “More
lights provide much better safe-
ty for the students.”

Catena said designated “safe
walking routes” have been
updated to include areas with
improved lighting.

“Students will have safe

because we put [the routes]
where the better lights are,” he
said. “They can feel a lot safer
when they’re out and about.”

Catena said the safety com-
mittee has begun reaching out
into the Oakland area to discuss
local safety, since he said it is an
issue which affects the entire
community.

“The university is not an
island  were part of Oakland,
but we branch all over,” Catena
said. “[Community] problems
often become our problems, so
if we work together, we can
solve a lot of the problems.”

Catena said cooperation is the
key to working toward a safer
campus. “The community and
the university have to work
together,” he said. “If they fight
each other, were not going to
get anywhere.”

According to Catena, Pitt’s
shuttle system operated well
this year after the separation of
Pitt’s Department of Parking
and Transportation from Public
Safety.

“Separating the ltwo depart-
ments] had a major impact on
the university because it cleared
matters up,” Catena said. “Now

that the system is up and run-
ning, it works very good.”

Catena said expansion of bus
routes could help the trans-
portation system run even bet-
ter.

“I’d like to see it expanded
just a little more, and I’d like to
see Van Call expanded a little
more too,” the said. “Van Call
gets people where they need to
go, and it provides a lot of safe-
ty, rather than people walking
the streets of Oakland late at
night.”

Among SGB’s Public Safety
Committee’s plans for next fall
is a campus-wide Public Safety
Week, a set of programs and
events which will help educate
students on many aspects of
safety.

“Public safety isn’t just about
dealing with crime,” Catena
said. “It concerns a lot of
aspects of students’ lives.”

Catena said SGB Board
Member Heath Golden has
been working with him in
helping integrate public safe-
ty officers to speak in Fresh-
man Studies classes in the
future.

earnings of $216,275 further

The University of Pittsburgh

Many in the Pittsburgh com-
munity were relieved when Dr.
Freddie Fu, a national figure in
sports medicine and orthopedic
surgeon at Pitt, chose to stay at
Pitt one month after announc-
ing he would take a chair posi-
tion at the University of
Pennsylvania. Fu said he recon-
sidered after hearing from sev-
eral of his friends and patients.

However, not all news from
UPMC this year has been good.

Suspicion has mounted
around a 1985 research study
which was headed by Pitt
researcher Dr. Bernard Fisher.
The study was a major confir-
mation of the effectiveness of
treating breast cancer without
breast removal. Fisher claimed
that flawed data has not affect-
ed his conclusions, but was
summoned to testify before
Congress.

The 1993 SGB left its mark on
the campus through a clock on
the William Pitt Union lawn, a
student discount program and
scholarship information book-
let. In addition, they put the fin-
ishing touches on an extensive
transportation system which
recently celebrated its one mil-
lionth rider.

and maintained his position
after being found guilty of a
campaign violation. All three
members of his ticket were also
elected to the board in the race
which had a field of 14 candi-
dates. This year’s board has
supported various activities on
campus and is in the process of
helping initiate a debit card pro-
gram.

The Black Action Society also
made their wish for a Black
Cultural Center known, in addi-
tion to Pitt increasing the
African—American retention rate.

The Mt. Graham Coalition
began with a few dedicated
members from the Student
Environmental Action Coalition
who were opposed to Pitt’s
possible involvement in con-
structing a telescope on Mt.
Graham. They began demon-
strating with protests and camp-
outs during the fall. In
December they attempted to
demonstrate in the chancellor’s
office, and they were dragged
out by campus police. Their
movement climaxed in April
with their day of action in
which they attracted hundreds
of observers to their music and
mock wedding on the Cathedral
lawn. City council also
announced their opposition to
the Mt. Graham project.

Pitt responded by saying,
“The project is not under active
consideration by the university
at the present time.”

Many students have also
raised their voices in protest to
police action on April 1 during
the police confrontation with
Upward Bound students in the
William Pitt Union. More than
80 students showed up at a rally
sponsored by the National
Society of Black Engineers,
many of whom accused police
of brutality and racism toward
their members who were wait-
ing for a bus at the time. Six Pitt
students were arrested during
the incident, but Interim Public

Josh Knauer, SEAC mem-
ber, said one of the major
local issues they will focus
on is stopping the clear-cut-
ting of Allegheny National
Forest.

The U.S. Forest Service
is currently selling off
the rights to the timber
to companies who
then come in and clear
away large sections of the
forest.

SEAC plans to work within
the legal system with other
activist organizations like
Heartwood, fighting for
appeals and court injunc-
tions to stop the destruction
of the forest.

Knauer said members also-

intend to continue their sup-
port of the Tri-state
Environmental Council,
which has been fighting to
stop the operation of the
WTI Toxic Waste Incinerator
in East Liverpool, Ohio. This
has been a local issue for
some time, with nearby
communities worried about
the effects the toxic waste
will have on the environ-
ment.

On campus, the coalition
plans to start an energy-sav-
ing campaign, asking

students and faculty to
conserve energy whenever
possible and encouraging
the administration to
purchase energy-efficient
light bulbs. An intensified
recycling program and a
composting program are
also in the works, Knauer
said.

Another main focus is the
recruitment of new members
for the organization.

According to Peters,
the large amount of atten-
tion they got through the
protests and Mt. Graham
Day of Action has helped to
get people interested in their
projects.

Peters said the success
they achieved with Mt.
Graham has shown people
they are serious about the
issues they address, and they
are hopeful this will encour-
age more people to get
involved.

Members said they believe
by keeping a high profile
on campus, using effective
advertising and staying
active on campus, many
people who have not known
about their efforts in the
past will come forward and
take a stand for the environ-
ment.

relived how Pittsburgh values

shaped his life, while former
New York Mayor Ed Koch

told students about his
boot camp proposal for all
teenagers.

In her speech at Pitt, U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno
emphasized the individual in
this country’s ﬁght against crime
and to make worthwhile use of
one’s time with children.

Pitt students made their
time worthwhile this year
in many respects. Through
their attendance at concerts,
contests and a dance marathon,
the Pitt Greeks topped last
year’s Greek Week total by

almost $8,000 by donating
$102,000 to Pennsylvania
Special Olympics.

At the Hand-in-Hand festival,
35 booths were operated by stu-
dent volunteers who played
host to disadvantaged children
for the afternoon.

One thankful parent said,
“Every year [my son] waits for it.
He loves seeing all the people,
meeting people, meeting his
friends  meeting the [Pitt]
football players and baseball
players. He loves it.”

‘Overall, the year has been
filled with its share of moments
of pride and shame for the uni-
versity community — all com-
bining to provide a learning
experience for all.

This is the final issue on which this editorial board is
ready to take a stand. Now that you know the best things
about this waning school year, it is time to face reality and
deal with the worst. So, the following are the jeers of 1994.

Mother Nature receives the first jeer. Remember the days
of the negative 60 degree temperatures and snow up to the
campus’ collective waist? Whilelthe weather can’t be expect-
ed to be perfect (especially in Pittsburgh), no one needs to
be reminded that the Arctic is a real place by having it
brought to them for a week.

While on the subject of winter wonderlands, J. Dennis
should have noses thumbed at him for not canceling school
on those terrible days and forcing faculty members to take
sick days if they could not make the trip into work.

James Flaherty deserves a jeer for his opposition to the
domestic partners plan proposed by Pitt. His remarks on
homosexuality were inappropriate and unacceptable.

The housing department proposed a new plan for provid-
ing guaranteed housing to all sophomores and incoming
freshmen, while leaving the upper classes out in the cold.
The system was inherently unfair and ultimately backfired

on them, as they are now running advertisements to try to .

fill the dorms. Perhaps students just don’t appreciate being
forced out and having their last days filled with the sounds
of cable installation.

The Black Action Society once again worked against its
stated goals by fomenting unrest when it violated university

‘policy. True diversity is not achieved through separatism,

but through communication with the campus community.

Jacob Brody deserves a special mention in this column of
shame. While everyone is relieved to have that beautiful
landmark bywhich they can set their personal timepieces,
the clock project just doesn’t feel like a proper waste with-
out the gazebo to complete the ensemble.

J The administration makes another appearance on the list ,
for their treatment of Paul Evans. Contracts should be hon-

ored, and intentions should be made clear. People should
not be strung along until the last minute and then told they
‘are’ not getting what they expected until they’ve completed
some task (an Italian Sub comes to mind here).

Unless people have been oblivious this term, they cannot
deny that the city police deserve a loud Bronx cheer for
their ability to maintain law and order. What would’ve hap-
pened if they hadn’t used maximum force to quell the
tumultuous uprising of these menacing high school students
who virtually seized the union? Why the SWAT Team wasn’t
called in no one will ever know.

Finally, the administration gets a general thumbs down for
treating students like transients. It prefers to wait until the
students are absent from the campus before making a deci-
sion which will affect the student body. This way, it doesn’t
have to concern itself with what the students think is in their
own best interest.

For all those who may take offense or issue with this col-
umn and their inclusion (or exclusion, there were probably
a few folks who should have been included but weren’t),
we would normally advise you to vent your anger and write
a letter to the editorial board, however we are out of here.

Highways can promote tolerance

If you stop and look around most college cam-
puses, you’ll discover that everybodys doing it.
Professors, employees and students -- the whole
lot. U2 is even doing it now. I’ve done it for about
two years.

Actually, when I started doing it, I wasn’t really
conscious of exactly what I was delving into. So,
anything I have to say is strictly in layperson’s ter-
minology and perspective. I hopped onto the
computerized information highway in 1992, com-
pletely unaware of the scope and magnitude of
this considerably far-reaching monstrosity. And if
you’re telling yourself that you simply can’t
endure another article about e-mail, the Internet
or any other type of computer dalliances, please
join the slower traffic in the right-hand lane.

The way things are going, it appears that soon-
er or later, everybody really will be doing it. I
think that if U2 has their way,

cations. Or maybe it’s not indicative of supreme
control at all; perhaps it just represents the conve-
nience of modern technology. Hmmm.

At any rate, there are those who think that
computer-based communication, whether it’s_ on
the Internet, via e-mail or wherever, can be posi-
tive. In a recent issue of Details magazine, the
Edge (if you don’t know who he is, stop reading)
discussed this aspect and commented that “...
there’s real interaction, real communication, a

revolution in the written word again. This is not

just a case of picking up the phone; you’ve actu-
ally got to sit down and write something.” So, this
sounds like it should be exciting and dynamic,
and I bet it’s great news for rhetoricians.

But from my own experience, I’d advise a cau-
tionary stance. Of course, maybe that’s just
because I’m a cautious gal, and I’m drawing on
my personal history. Although

we’ll all be merging onto the so-
called information highway
eventually, whether through a
computer, the media or some

Amy Hajduk

he may mock mainstream atti-
tudes, in Details, Bono summed
up the direction and subsequent
meaning of information-laden

other communications medium. _
Since I’m traveling on this thor- .
oughfare, I’m naturally more cognizant of my fel-
low wanderers, as well as those souls who aren’t
doing it yet.

You’ll have to excuse some of these corny
metaphors, but, ya know, the highway analogy is
just too classic, and as a writer, not manipulating
it would be a grievous error. So, realizing that
there might be about five of you who haven’t
accessed this technological age yet, I’ll direct my
thoughts accordingly.

For me, e—mail, or electronic mail, is the
lifeblood of this info highway, and it’s pretty
damn near close to being the neatest invention
since Levi’s.

Of course, like all of the best things in life, e-
mail comes with some possibly inherent disad-
vantages. If you’re careful, you won’t let the con-
cept of communicating via cyberspace inﬂuence
and eventually dominate your real-life inter-
course.

I think there is a considerable danger that e-
mail purveyors could begin to carry the ease and
quasi—anonymity associated with written comput-
er communication into their daily human interac-
tions. Instead of calling up a friend to discuss
something, you can rely on e-mail as a pretty
effective way to avoid embarrassing, painful or
awkward moments. E-mail allows you to write
and rewrite, edit and compose, as many times as
necessary before you send your message off to
your electronic interlocutor. In a sense, you have
complete control over your output, and can
manipulate it to suit your needs. Such control is
sometimes not present in face-to-face communi-

technology quite. nicely: “I feel
that music is of the spirit, and the
only thing that interests me is where it connects
with human relationships, because if technology
doesn’t serve that, it serves nothing.” Wow.

And just imagine; this statement came from the
man who brought you the Zoo TV Tour and
Zooropa. It’s heartening, then, to realize that the
guy who fronted the rather earnest Joshua Tree
Tour back _in 1987 has navigated the information
highway and managed to retain his old stance as
a dedicated humanitarian. It shows that it is pos-
sible, then, to explore cyberspace and come out
unscathed. .

And don’t misinterpret me here. I’m a definite
proponent of e-mail, bulletin board systems and
general computer interaction. Like the Santa
Monica Freeway, this information thruway could
very well ‘become the busiest in the world.

A friend came across a note posted on the
Internet, and its essential message was that
the potential to interact with thousands of differ-
ent individuals on a worldwide scale could possi-
bly increase general understanding and toler-
ance.

It makes sense. Isn’t there a maxim that says

communication promotes tolerance? If not, there
should be. So, hey, what better way to try it out
than to ask you to give me your thoughts?

Finger my account and give it a whirl. But only
if you’re able to sit through a Jim Jarmusch film.
Oh  what the hell, even if you can’t, I might
respond out of the desire to try out this notion of
increased tolerance through cyberspace commu-
nication.

THE PITT NEWS, THURSDAY, APRIL 21, 1994

Media determining our foreign policy is not so bad

Well, it’s about time. The
United States finally ﬂexed
some muscle in Bosnia, or
Yugoslavia, or whatever that
country is called. Good! I think
it’s about time for another war.
It’s been four years since the
Gulf War, and television shows
have been getting worse each
year since then. Nothing com-
pares to a war on television;
especially when we’re winning.
Yes, I. say, “we,” as though the
United States were a sports
team, but wars on television are
indeed like sporting events. The
Gulf War was kind of like
watching a really sick version of
American Gladiators or ESPN2’s
coverage of a wicked paintball
game. Yugoslavia probably
won’t be as good a war for tele-
vision, so I don’t see too much
point in getting involved. I

Since the Gulf War ended, the
media and the government have
been searching desperately for
a good, made-for—TV war. The
Kurdish uprising was just plain

awful. There was something
about the word “Kurd.” Perhaps
it sounded too much like the
word “turd.” Also, there just
wasn’t too much excitement
over military airdrops, as long
as they were humanitarian.
Now, if the air force had
attached small explosives to the
TV dinners they were dropping,

perhaps operation “Provide

Comfort,” would have been a

bigger success in the ratings.
After the Kurdish fiasco, there

was a long lull, sporadically

‘ broken by threats of air strikes

against Iraq. Boring. What else
was left to bomb? Soon fol-
lowed the Somalia follies,
where one minute the United
States is the Messiah in desert
fatigues and the next minute its
playing freeze tag with Farah
Aideed in the desert. Somalia
was painful to watch. It -made
me realize that despite how
much money is spent on
defense, we couldn’t beat a
bunch of barefoot guys carrying

stones and twigs. Luckily we
pulled out of Somalia before the
Somalis started using slingshots
and Swiss army knives. Haiti
was weak and quickly forgotten
and Yugoslavia looks like a
dud. North Korea, however,
offers some interesting possibili-
ties.

Gallahou

A war with North Korea
seems like a pretty good idea.
There is a clear enemy and a
clear border separating good
from bad. TV commercials can
hype the war like a boxing
match. “The United States. She
won the revolution and every
war after until she fought to a
draw in Korea. Now it’s time to
finish the job!” Another good
aspect of a war against North

Have you done it? Ylae C/oec/elist

Yes, I’m back. Well, more
bizarre things have happened.
In fact, that’s kind of the point
of this rambling.

In the past four years, a lot
of outrageous things have
happened at Pitt.

I haven’t decided, yet
whether or not I’m lucky to
have witnessed or taken part
in or heard about these
events, but maybe that obser-
vation isn’t one for me to
determine. 0

Anyway, some of the things
you’re about to read may or
may not have happened.

But the fun part is, I’m
the only one who knows the
truth (well, besides the sel-
ect few who may have partak-
en).

At any rate, here’s my list of
“Things to do Before You
Graduate from Pitt." l

Before I begin, though, I
should take the time to thank
those of you who‘ve partici-
pated; it‘s because of you I
can say these things.

-Defame someone in The
Pitt News

-Attend an RA party at my
place

with someone you just met at
C_]’s (this is more of a fresh-
man year obligation)

-Perform blatant sexual acts
during a Zelda’s Happy Hour

-Find clean silverware in
the Towers cafeteria

-Have your dad rate all the
movies you have on tape on a
scale of one to 10 so your
friends will know if it’s worth
it to borrow them from you or

anymore 0

and pretend you’re Greek

-Eat chocolate donuts and
drink chocolate milk to
“soothe” your stomach after a
night of quarter drafts

and hide it from them

-Tell an RD that you’re not
drunk, you just have a speech

350 degrees at 2 a.m. and for-
get about it until 11 a.m.

-Flood your Towers floor
(and then say you .didn’t)

,°Clean your apartment
(This is unheard of, and I
can’t prove it’s ever been
done, anywhere.) l

-Inadvertently have a con-
versation with the South
Oakland shuttle driver and
then wonder for an hour or
two if you’re crazy, since it
seemed what she said made
sense I

-Try to rent a U-Haul with-
out a driver’s license

-Wallpaper your kitchen
(or any large area) with rejec-
tion letters

-Bitch about having to pay
for a cap and gown

-Break into someone’s
room, steal something and

someone on the Sutherland
Bus who says Super Grover
could kick Yoda’s ass

Korea is the threat of escalation
to a nuclear war. Now, I fear the
apocalyptic horrors of a nuclear
war as much as the next person,
but —— it’s a fact — the threat of
nuclear war sells. Besides, a
nuclear war on the Korean
peninsula wouldn’t affect us in
the United States; we’re too far
away. The fact is a nuclear war
would be cool to watch. If
North Korea launched a nuclear
attack against South Korea, we
TV viewers would be treated to
Patriot missiles raising from
behind ducking newsmen hilar-
iously trying to get a promotion
and a Pulitzer.

One final aspect that would
make a war in North Korea
good copy is the fact that the
United States has not been at
war with an Asian country for
almost 20 years. In this century,
every generation, with the
exception of “Generation X,”
has been treated to a war with a
different Asian country. Perhaps
this is the time for “Generation

X” to get their war and at the
same time, give the parents of
Generation Xers good TV time
to sell to advertisers.

There are only a few more
hot spots in the world that
would make for good televi-
sion. Russia’s a possibility, espe-
cially if Boris “80 Proof’ Yeltsin
is “removed” from office for
health reasons and replaced by
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, another
drunk. Good 01’ Vlad threw
stones and spat at Jewish pro-
testers in France this weekend
and then threatened to shoot
them with an “atomic gun.”
Clearly this guy makes a good
TV show, but he might just be
too drunk to want to mess with.
So, it looks like Korea is the
next logical TV war for the
United States. I hope it’s soon,
because without Kerrigan and
Harding on the news, every day,
there just isn’t anything to
watch.

I have realized that there
are some trains of thought
in the fabric of our genera-
tion’s way of thinking that
need to be recognized and
dismantled.

These concern our ideas
of what life is about, what
we want to do‘ and who we
think we want to be.

The perfectionistic ideals
that our generation has
established '

Generation needs
to redeﬁne average

ing your goals.

Second, and most impor-
tantly, we must drop those
deeply embedded notions
of what “averageness” z‘sn"t.

how to keep from being, or
being seen as, just another
face in the drab crowd,
yaufre R13QlR€tl2l¥ dead
wrong.

How stimulating or inter-

esting you are

these days —

is not deter-

detrimental if taken too seri-
ously. And this often hap-
pens because these limited
views about life have been
deeply embedded into our
way of thinking.

As young people, we’ve
adopted these popular
ideals to escape something
we have all been trained to
be afraid of ——- we’re all
afraid to be “average” (even
though there is no such
thing).

There are two factors here
that make this kind of think-
ing bull. First, euerjyonehat
some point(s) in their life,
must live in a situation
where they have to do the
things that need to be done
to accomplish anything (i.e.
pay your bills, make your
grades, establish a career
path, etc.). I

There are times in life
when you must realize that
you can get itdone now or
do it later. It’s easier to do it
now when your dreams are
still in your head, and when
you still have the energy to

etc. —can be determined

by how much you socialize!
It is determined by your
personality, your attitude
and your everyday thoughts.
It’s the things you can do,
or the way you can act in
any situation at any time. It’s
how you’re seen everyday
that establishes how unique
you are.
Are you a positive thinker?
Do you laugh often?
Are you a good listener?
Are you generous?
Do you have curiosity in
even the stupidest things?
Do you have hobbies
from exercising to snail-rais-
ing?
Do you show your emo-
tions?
Can you be alone?
Do you make others

to these questions, nobody

tantly, you won’t either.

Let’s be frank: the 1993-94
sports year here at good ole
Pitt U. was one fraught with
disappointment. There were
no big-time championship
teams, no one going deep into
their respective NCAA tourna-
ments and almost no one send— .,
ing a jolt of exhilaration
through the Panther communi-
ty.
That is not to say, however,
that the year of the turnover
(personnel, that is) was not
peppered with its share of
exciting moments and exciting
figures. There were a few here 
and there, but, for the most A
part, all teams were either OK _
or disappointing, depending
on your pre—season outlook or
lack thereof.

First of all, the football pro-
gram, except for pre—season 1
workouts in Johnstown and a
couple of monumental

 

Thursdays in the history of
inter-collegiate athletics was

 pretty wretched.   9

“New” head coach John
Majors did what he could
inheriting a 5-7-1 team from
1992 with virtually no
recruiting class, and forged a
3-8 record during one of the
most brutal schedules in
recent Pitt history,

The Panthers were pre-
dictably pummeled by pow-
erhouses Ohio State, Notre
Dame, Miami and Boston-
College by a Combined score
of 175-35 -— that they would

not win those games was no surprise.
What was a surprise was the Panther

   

  
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
   
   
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 

uncanny Thursday night success. When
ESPN bumped Auburn from their open-
ing night game because of NCAA proba-
tion, Majors and his newly-uniformed
squad flew down to Hattiesburg, Miss.,
two days early to take on the double-
digit favorite Golden Eagles.

They flew out with a national televi-
sion and oh-so-satisfying 14-10 win.
While mic-men Mike Patrick and Mike
Gottfried marveled in the larger-than-life
exploits of linebackers Tom Tumulty
(two interceptions) and Gerald Simpson
and All-Pitt News running back Curtis
Martin (68 yards), Dr. Jerry Punch gave
air time to a joyous (yet very sweaty)
Majors after the game —- in which Majors
said roughly he was more proud of that
team than any team in history, than even
our troops who invaded Normandy
some 50 years ago (writer’s embellish-
ment).

 however, as Virginia Tech optioned
 the hell out of a sieve-like defense
that resembled nothing like the one
that had shown up only a week
before. Ohio State just plain pow-
ered its way over the Panthers, who
gave a nice fight to Louisville a
week later, finally succumbing in
the second half.

Pitt’s Thursday night glory
returned when it traveled to the
badlands of New Jersey and
knocked off a disappointing Rutgers
squad 21-10 on  you guessed it,
Thursday night. Billy West, filling in
for a beat up Curtis Martin, grabbed
player—of—the—game honors on ESPN
(da-da-da, da-da-da).

Two‘ losses followed, and, in
one of the least—followed games in
athletic history, the Panthers went
into Veterans Stadium and merciful-
ly dropped the Temple Owls 28-18
before  a couple of family mem-
bers and the local midget team who
lost their version of the Super Bowl
(the winners got a free dinner at the
local Stake And Ale). 9

The men’s basketball team
fared about as well as the football
team, losing its final nine games
after starting 13-5 en route to a 15-14
record and no post-season tourna-
ment.

  
  
 

Pitt, which

to an “NCAA

lost its head

Pitt Athletic
Director Oval
Jaynes decided
to not accept
Paul Evans’
counter-offer
for a new con-
tract and
rescinded his
original offer.
Jaynes then
promptly hired
former Western
Kentucky head
man Ralph
Willard as Pitt’s
new head
coach.
Willard inherits
one star (point
guard Jerry
McCullough), a few role players (Sotiris
Aggelou, Orlando Antigua and Chris
Gant) and not much else. In winning 15
games, the Panthers won a pair of tough
road games — St. John’s and NCAA-
entry Boston College —' and beat tour-
ney team Providence at home.

North Carolina,’ Seton Hall and
Connecticut all gave the Panthers nation-
ally-televised home losses, and, aside
from the occasional Eric Mobley monster
slam, not much happened on the hard-
wood. Mobley was the only Panther on
the Big East’s post-season team (he took
third-team honors at center behind
UConn’s Donyell Marshall and B.C.’s Bill
Curley).

joking aside, in a perfect ,

“Welcome to Arthur]. Rooney

Discuss your feelings about
Pitt.

Thank you, voice from above.
You know that rule parents are
supposed to teach their kids
about not saying anything if you
don’t have anything nice to say?
I don’t remember if my parents
ever tried to teach me that one,
but if they did, it didn’t
take.

Dear Pitt, how do you annoy
me — let me count the ways.

Shall we discuss that they
don’t actually wash the dishes
in the Towers cafeteria? In case
you were wondering, plates

with solid food still on them do ‘

not count as washed.

Unlike many people, I am not
unhappy with the fact that they
are putting cable in my building
just before I graduate, because I
wouldn’t be graduating if it had

been there all along.

But I am a bit perturbed about
the fact that the university cared
so little for me and the other

residents in the building that

they had workers drilling and
hammering at nine in the mom-
ing. They could have done it
over the summer when there
will be fewer residents in the
building. They didn’t even warn
us they were going to be doing
it.
Oh, but they did give us

Ryan
Buncher

notice that TCI workers will
have access to our rooms. Now
I feel good about the safety of
my stuff. How about a little pri-
vacy?

The university also decided to
guarantee housing to not only
all incoming first—year students,
but also the sophomores-to—be.
This, screw—the-upperclassmen
attitude makes me wonder
about the university, which I’m
sure is aware that most students
will not want to transfer after

two years.

The bottom line appears to
be, once we have your money
— screw you. I wonder what
my attitude will be once I have
my education?

Talle about The Pitt News.

Again, many thanks, but I’m
not sure I can get those opin-
ions in. There’s this little thing
about not allowing employees
to criticize the paper which
got me in trouble a while
ago.
’ ell, I’ll try.

There have been many times I
was not proud of this wonderful
institution.

I was not proud when our
Sports Editor was fired two
years ago.

But I am proud of the sports
section over the last four years.
This is not arrogance, just being
happy that I got to work with
great people in the section like
Mike Rampa, Scott Campbell,
Derek Willis, Rob Mazur, Tom
Schneider, Rob Pugliese, Brian
Gallagher and Jason Brame.
Having photos from Jake
Hillman, Paul Diamond, Matt
Serlin, Jim Madl and Tony
Fiorini didn’t hurt either.(Not to
mention sanity saviors Chip

Updegrove and April Rodgers.)

I have bitched for weeks
about wanting to get out of
here. People tell me I will miss
the paper when I’m gone -—— I
won’t. The good part of it -— the
people I’ve become close to
don’t need a newspaper to be
part of my life.

Okay, end of sappiness.

I sense a little bitterness above
there?

Haven’t you read my stuff
over the last few years? I don’t
know any other way. Besides,
you didn’t have to work around
ridiculous junk like the non-sex-
ist language policy.

Once and for all -— they are
freshmen. Any college woman
who is going to be scarred for
life by being labeled a freshman
has some serious problems any-
way.

You can have all the other
words you want, just give me
freshman back.

I know it is part of an overall
movement in this country
toward non-sexist language. Do
not say we are changing to a
more proper manner of speech
because others are being left

out.

Holyfield diggin' heels in Las Vegas sand for angry Moorer

While a certain defrocked
heavyweight champion sits in
an Indiana jail brushing up on
his algebra so he can get his
GED and collect a Get Out of
jail Free card, there’s a ﬁre—f1ght
about to go on this Friday in Las

es than punches.

Moorer has learned respect.
All along, both of these boxers
have shown an uncommon
regard for each other.

For Holyﬁeld — The Saint, of
whom one writer begins a story
about how the champ left a pre-
fight hypathon to pray, (T hat’s
P-R—A-Y not Mike T yson’s P-R-
E-Y) — this is pretty much
expected.

OK, all hail the righteous
Holyfield, but Moorer’s new
attitude gives us a real clue that
he not only understands there
was onlylone Ali, but that he
ha.s his mission disciplined in
his mind, that he knows some-
thing we have yet to see from
him, that he has the will of a
champion.

What most of us have missed
about boxing is how much a
fighter with a great heart, like
Holyfield, has to subvert his pri-
mal instinct to survive.

To do what most of us think
is mad and accept the atomic
blows of a heavyweight chal-

lenger.

To go toe—to—toe with insanity
itself and turn it inside out.

What does a fighter like
Holyfield have to do when the
pain comes?

He’s got to love it, and that’s
something Evander has done
well. He loves it so well it cost
him his title in the first fight with
Riddick Bowe. Holyfield took
blows to give his own and
ended up on his can, a place
the Bad Boy has altogether
avoided.

Moorer looked like a tentative
chump against jurassic joke
Bonecrusher Smith and took
nobody Mike Evans to a
dawdling decision. With a
slugfest involving one Bert
“Count Me Out” Cooper that
cemented Moorer’s glass chin
reputation sandwiched in
between, there are doubts
about the young man from
Monessen. Ignore them. He’s
gonna turn Holyfield out like a
motherf—kin’ light.

Womens athletic coaches tired of lack of support from Pitt

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

It was almost two years ago, but not
much has changed.

Kirk Bruce stood in the Towers Lobby
stuffing ﬂyers into issues of The Pitt News
and handing them to everyone who
would take one.

Bruce is not the leader of some cam—
pus student group trying to enlist new
members or even some kind of political
activist pushing some idealistic agenda.
He is the head coach of an athletic team
at a major Division-I school trying to
draw fans to watch his team play an
exhibition game against a team from
Russia.

“That particular time, we stuffed ﬂyers
in The Pitt News,” Bruce said. “People
were picking it up anyway. We were
soliciting everybody. Everyone who
Came through those doors, we were
going to talk to them. We shouldn’t have
to do that.

“I don’t mind doing that. It keeps you
humble, but that’s one thing we
shouldn’t have to finalize.”

Bruce’s Lady Panther basketball team
led all of Pitt’s‘ varsity women’s athletic
programs in attendance this season. That
might be impressive if that average per
game was more than 375 fans.

Pitt’s women’s programs —— volleyball,
basketball, tennis, track, cross country,
swimming and diving and gymnastics -
have struggled for years to bring in fans
and corporate sponsors.

Attendance is important for the suc-
cess of a program. Recruits are going to
be more impressed by a program that

 

can offer a large crowd of loud support-
ers than a program like Pitt’s is now,
which offers plenty of empty
bleachers at its women’s sporting
events.

“When you are an athlete and you are
busting your butt year—round and you
are good, it’s nice to have somebody
clap for you when you win,” Pitt volley-
ball head coach Cindy Braziel said. “It’s a
nice reward for all of the effort you put
in.”

With the athletic department focusing
its marketing efforts on football and

, team that is a part of the Pitt cheerlead-

ers to draw larger crowds to some
games.

“You get one kid and two parents for
each kid,” Bruce said.

“You get a hundred kids and maybe
150 parents.” A

Both coaches pointed to the need for
more help in marketing from the athletic
department.

“It’s difficult because we are doing

. other things,” Bruce said.

“We’re traveling. We’re recruiting.
We're practicing. Yet, we have to take

men’s basketball, the women’s coaches
have had to handle the marketing of
their teams themselves. '
Bruce and Braziel both said that they
put out flyers around campus and send
out mailers to local high schools adver-
tising events. The volleyball team also
uses a mailer _ service for the

area.
The women’s basketball team also
took advantage of a junior cheerleading

time away from our day to promote
IOO.

“We do not just coach here,” Bruce
said.

“It would be great if we did, but we
don’t. What we need is more help from
Sports Information.”

Braziel, a former assistant at Texas
A&M and Wyoming, said that she does
not think it is unreasonable to ask for
more help in promotions.

“I’ve been at two other major universi-
ties,” Braziel said.

“I have gotten more support from the
sports information department [at those
schools], so I know it can be done.
Obviously, they may be facing budget
limitations and staff limitations. If they
don’t get the directive from the top to
put X amount of time into this thing,
they aren’t going to do it.

“Sports information can have a huge
impact on marketing and promotions for
each program. I’ve seen it happen."

Pitt Associate Athletic Director/Public
Relations Larry Eldridge pointed out
some of the things the athletic depart-
ment and Sports Information. have done
to promote women’s sports.

This year, the women’s basketball
team joined the men at Midnight
Madness.

They were also included on the same
schedule card. They also got schedule
posters, which Eldridge said the depart-
ment will be putting out for the other
teams in the future.

The Sports Information Department

S also makes up schedule cards and media

guides for each sport. Until recently,
most of the non—revenue sports were
included in a joint media guide.

“It just made sense for each sport to
have its own brochure,” Eldridge
said.

Eldridge pointed to finding creative
ways to promote all of Pitt athletics and
working more closely with the coaches
as avenues to improving the marketing
of Pitt women’s athletics.

“We want to do a better job of working

his team. His tumultuous tenure
as head man came to an end on
March 2 when it was
announced that he would not
return to Pitt. Evans decided to
forgo comment and skipped the
media bash under Pitt
Stadium.

The Pitt Wrestling team hov-
ered around .500 for most of the
season and finished at 8-9 on
the year. But one man, a trans-
fer from Iowa no less, who
didn’t compete at Pitt last year,
stole the show.

Rich Catalano pulled in All-
American honors for his show-
stopping performances during
the season. Winning 25 matches
during the regular season, the
167—pounder lost only once —
in an early tournament in Las
Vegas.

Otherwise, he ran off Most

on the All-Pitt News team.

As a whole, the wrestling
team placed only four wrestlers
at EWLS: Catalano, Derek
Burgert, Pat Wiltanger and John
Richey.

The soccer team saw a strong
season end at the hands of the
Georgetown Hoyas on a snowy
Sunday morning.

The 5-1 loss to that emotional
morn eliminated the Panthers
from the Big East conference
post—season tourney — a peak
they were trying to reclimb after
1992’s magical Cinderella sea-
son.

Finishing with a 9-5-3 record,
the Panthers were led by scor-
ing machines Erik Duffy (29
points) and Jeff Porter (18). The
two battled during the season
for the team’s point title, with
Duffy finally pulling away near
the end.

A change in goal from last
year’s rookie surprise Adam
Spitzer to this year’s steady per-
former Kirk Brodows was the

  

     
    
    
    
   

  

 
    
   
   
  
 

 
  

    
 

most surprising move in the
lineup. Brodows ﬁnished with a
7-3-1 record

The men’s swimming and
diving team recaptured their
Big East title from Villanova in
fine fashion.

After doubling every oppo-
nent’s dual match score, the
Panthers ripped into the confer-
ence’s best, regaining the title
that they lost last season while
besting runner—up Syracuse by
73 points.

The divers did equally well as
the swimmers.

Soulakis, Sean Braud and
Steve Wolf were almost always
at the top of the boards as they
compiled regular season excel-
lence into tournament domi-
nance.

The women’s swimming
and diving team wasn’t as for-
tunate, taking fourth place in
the Big East.

Diver Sunday Lewandowski
was the only Lady Panther who
took home an individual cham-
pionship.

Pitt senior captain Jen Burns
finished seconds in a pair of
events. A

A pair of divers represented
Pitt in nationals, as
Lewandowski and Soulakis
each garnered honorable men-
tion All—American awards.

Lewandowski’s highest finish ,

was ninth and Soulakis’ was
22nd against the best in the
nation.

The women’s basketball
team was probably the only Pitt
team that exceeded expecta-
tions this season, compiling a
21-10 record.

Friday:

The Lady Panthers were
snubbed in the NCAA selec-
tions, but earned their first post-
season spot since 1980 with an
invite to the NWIT. .

Forward Jonna Huemrich fin-
ished her career fourth on Pitt
women’s basketball all—time
scoring list and racked up dou-
ble digits in points in her last 58
games.

She and the team’s three other
seniors —— forward Jill
Colabrese, center Carolyn Miller
and three-point gunner Erin
Maloy - anchored a club that
improved drastically with a
pressure defense and a charged-
up running style.

The volleyball team has not
done much losing over the
years, but it took a big loss
when head coach Sue Woodstra
left to take a pro coaching job in
Germany in mid-July.

Replacement and former-.

assistant Cindy Braziel led the
Panthers to their sixth—straight
Big East championship — this
one in dramatic fashion as Pitt
erased a two-games—to-none
deficit to knock off Seton Hall in
the title game.

Pitt was again unable to get
past the first round of the NCAA
tournament —— losing an open-
ing round, five-game match at
George Washington.

Ann Marie Lucanie ended her
career with her fourth Most
Outstanding Player of the Big
East Tournament award, confer-
ence Player of the Year honors
and became the first All-
American in Pitt volleyball his-
tory when she was named to

. the second team.

But only because
Holyfield is Holyfield.

If he possessed a lesser
fighter’s heart, he could
decision Moorer easily
with skill and superior
conditioning.

I He won’t. Remember
that Moorer’s former
trainer, the godfather of
the KO —— Emanuel
Steward — moved into
Holyfield’s corner until
very recently.

So the aggressive

- poWer—punching style of
Steward’s storied Kronk
Gym has made its mark
on both fighters, but only
Moorer has those
tools.

The only question left is
Moorer’s state of mind.
Something about his brain
seems inevitably tied to
his chin.

And there are no signs
of weakness here, thanks
‘to current Moorer trainer
Teddy Atlas, a Cus

in conjunction with the coach-
es,” Eldridge said.

“Promotion is our discipline,
so it is up to us to do that.”

Part of the problem is limited
interest in some of the sports.

“You can’t mandate people’s
interest,” Eldridge said.

Women’s collegiate athletics
have a relatively short tradition
nationwide. In 1974, Pitt added
women’s varsity sports to its
athletic department in Compli-
ance with the recently passed
(by Congress) Title IX, which
mandated a more equal place
for women in Collegiate athlet-
ics (The Pitt News, Nov. 30,
1993).

Those relatively new teams
are competing with long-stand-
ing sports institutions such as
the Pirates, Steelers and men’s
athletic programs at Pitt.

The city is also a complica-
tion. Pittsburgh is a hard sell in
terms of getting fans in seats -
just ask the Penguins. One year
removed from winning consec-
utive Stanley Cups and they
can’t even sell out playoff
games.

Eldridge pointed to that com-
petition as one reason the
women’s teams have very few
corporate sponsorships, saying
that there are only so many dol-
lars to go around.

The sponsorships Pitt does
have are mostly year-by—year
agreements, such as the pizza
giveaway deals the volleyball
team has had.

Eldridge said the athletic
department will be trying to
bring in more long-term
arrangements, possibly linking
them to revenue sports
to sweeten a prospective
deal.

Those things won’t Change.
One thing that can is the lack of
marketing of women’s athletics
at Pitt.

“Traditionally, marketing here,

dealt with revenue sports [foot-
ball and basketball], because
those teams are the lifeblood of

the athletic department finan-

cially,” Eldridge said.

“[Right now] we are taking a
hard look at our marketing
effort from A to Z. We’re look-
ing at places to better market
and promote.”

The reality is that Pitt proba-
bly will not be able to market its
teams equally.

“Ideally, you’d like all the ath-
letes to be marketed equally,”
Eldridge said. “That’s always
going to be difﬁcult to do for a
variety of reasons. You ultimate-
ly have to look at the program
in total — what you would like
to do and what is possible to
do.”

There are some problems
unique to each sport. For exam-
ple, how do you promote track

 

and cross Country programs that
have about one or two home
events per season? Tennis
would have a hard time finding
a place to put the fans it draws,
since there is no place to sit in
the Cost Center.

There are also sports that just
don’t sell well in this region.
With the exception of isolated
campuses like Penn State, vol-
leyball does not draw well in

I the East.

“The sport of volleyball in this
part of the country is not that
revered,” Braziel said.
“Women’s basketball is the
[women’s] sport to play in
Pennsylvania.”

The women’s basketball team
is in the best position from a
marketing standpoint because
women’s basketball is starting
to gain national attention. USA
Today runs women’s scores and
updates right along with the
men’s. Regular season and Final
Four games have made it onto

CBS. The women’s basketball’

teams were included in deals
the network made earlier this

year with the SEC and the Big
East.

The Post-Gazette started run-
ning stories on women’s basket-
ball this year, and WTAE News
mentioned some scores‘ and ran
three feature pieces on the
team.

“Part of this is the growing
status of women’s basketball,”
Eldridge said.

“It is also the success of this
year’s team.”

Bruce and women’s swim-
ming coach Marian Cassidy
both pointed to the media as a

' promising outlet for informing

Pittsburgh about Pitt’s women’s
athletic programs.

Bruce said that he calls local
radio stations trying to get
scores from Pitt games on the
air.

Not all of the coaches put a
high priority on the media right
now. Some are frustrated by a
lack of coverage in the past.
Others think the public needs to
be educated about the particu-
lar sports first.

“There are so many things

that would have to happen in
Pittsburgh for [the media] to
have an impact on our atten-
dance or donations,” Braziel
said.

"We feel that we’re going to
get more out of tapping the vol-
leyball community first. Once
we get those people going, then
we can appeal to John Q.
Public, who will come to a
match and see 500 people and
think this is cool, and then he’s
going to look for it in the
paper.”

Those fan totals seem far off
for a volleyball team that has
more than its share of matches
with fewer than 100 fans in
attendance.

“The crowd that Pitt volleyball
has drawn from has been a little
bit the students, a little bit the
volleyball fanatics, and that
adds up to all the 12 people that
Come,” Braziel joked.

Those small crowds are for a
team that has won six Big East

championships in a row and has
boasted one of Pitt’s top athletes
the last four years.

“Ann Marie Lucanie is one of
the best athletes I’ve seen at the
College level,” Eldridge
said.

Lucanie, along with other
recent All-Americans at Pitt,
such as gymnast Kristen Brown,
plus Najuma Fletcher and
Allison Williams of the track
team, have all competed in front
of empty stands.

Winning is supposed to bring
attention, but the volleyball and
swimming programs have
drawn few fans despite power-
house status in the Big
East.

Women’s basketball took a
step in that direction with a 21-
10 record this season, but stu-
dents walking through the
Towers lobby could very well
run into Pitt’s women’s basket-
ball coach handing out ﬂyers
again next season.

You may have noticed that
we can talk about Redmen,
Braves and Redskins in this
paper — all of which are con-
sidered offensive to the Native
American population. They are

I just too small a group to force

changes on their own.

The truth is we aren’t making
changes when it is right. We are
making them when enough
people bitch.

How about talking about
your ca reer?

I’ve said it more times than I
can remember, but never in
print. I walked into The Pitt
News before I walked into a
class back in August of 1990.
Next thing I knew, I was cover-
ing Pitt volleyball. Never mind
that I didn’t even know that it
was a women’s team or how
many players they had on the
court at a time.

The accident of that assign-
ment led to my niche over the
last four years — women’s ath-
letics. I covered volleyball and
women’s basketball for three

years each. I watched volleyball
stretch its streak of Big East
titles to six.

I wrote about Ann Marie
Lucanie when she became the
first All—American in the history
of Pitt volleyball

I wrote about Lorri Johnson
the year she became the all—time
leading scorer in Panther bas-
ketball — men’s or
women’s.

I watched Jonna Huemrich be
the kind of rock-solid consistent
performer on the women’s side
that the men’s team has desper-
ately lacked the last few
years.

Basically, those of you who
have been going to women’s
athletics events at Pitt for the
last four years in your empty-
seat disguises (cliché time)
missed out.

Glad I didn’t.

Why in hell isn't every band in the world a lit-
tle bit more like Citizen Fish? No pretension
there, baby. Just honest, legit, punk as hell rock
n' roll music- straight from the heart. -No addi-
tives, no preservatives. If you missed ‘em on
tuesday night, you do indeed have something to
cry over. However, just to ease the pain, I've got
a whole bunch 0' stuff for you to mull over while
you're ignoring your finals. ,

A bit of not-so-good news first. Tonight, at
CCBC out in Beaver county somewhere, those
crazy kids from Smashing Pumpkins will make
their presence known in their only Pittsburgh

, area performance. Rumour has it that they will
headline this Lollapalooza thing I've been hear-

ing about this summer, but that's just rumour- I ’

also heard Nick Cave is playing, but I have
enough trust in him to know it ain't so. Opening

  for the pumpkins are ris'ng Indie stars Red Red
Meat, who were at the B T a few short months
ago... how things change... A r

' Tonight also heralds the triumphant return of
local superstars and Mercury recording artists
Rusted Root, with an all ages ‘show at Graffiti at
7pm with > reggae openers Rasta Rafiki.
Apparently, this band has an agenda which
includes changing the face of pop music as we
know it, so catch ‘em now while you can.
Tomorrow they'll be at Graffiti for the over 21
crowd, with local dirty drunken geniuses

. Hellbelly. I just (saw these. cats last weekend and
can tell you first hand that they aren't to be
missed.

The Electric Banana is the least likely place
in Pittsburgh for Madder Rose to pawn its
English-styled music-for-girls-who-read-a-lot. Of
course, Seattle pop-grungies Best Kissers in
the World are an unlikely touring partner, and
local punk drunk-rockers the Addicts have
probably never even met people like the Rose's.

THE PI’lT NEWS, Thursday, April 21,1994

All in all, this over 21 show at the Banana on
Friday night is bound to be interesting for more
reasons than music. 9pm. _

Here's where it gets great again. Saturday
night, April 23, Graffiti welcomes surf guitar leg-
end Dick Dale with his band Thunder. Dale's
music has created and perpetuated a style of
guitar playing which has influenced hundreds
of Fender Jag totin' fansl musicians. Local

openers the Rowdy Bovines are a rockabilly ,

treat for Teds of all ages, and Clean Teen are
apparently a wonder all their own. Over 21 at
Graffiti, Sat., 9pm.

A week later, Saturday April 30, leaves us
faced with a big decision. At Graffiti, texan min-
isterl rockabilly diva Reverend Horton Heat will
set the world on fire with some of the best god
damned guitar I've ever heard. The Reverend

can stir up an audience like noone since Jerry

Lee Lewis went country, and next week will be

no let .down. Check out tunes like "PsychobiIly“

Freakout" and "Marijuana" to see what he can
do. A

On the other hand, the CMU Graduate
Coffeehouse presents an evening of the dark
and gothic. Local superstars the Garden are
known throughoutthe country for their ethereal,
4AD-esque music, and I'm sure they need no
introduction for fans of the style..However, the
excitement of this concert is the premiere, of
sorts, of two new local ambient groups. The
Underflowers are a haunting and beautiful
chamber group with a Renaissance feel, beauti-
ful, intangible female vocals, airy guitars and a
violin to add substance to the soundwaves.
Their performancesare flawless, lending a unity

to the music which is imperative with this kind of .

style: it sounds like a thought. Revelations in
Black are a brand new group playing medieval
music like Dead Can Dance and And Also the
Trees. The one song I've heard by them was a
version of the Irish air She Moved Through the
Fair, and I think it typifies their music: slow,
emotional, and very dark. 6
Until the summer issues, that'll do....

some for the news and report-
ing and others because I make
it seem like I’m talking directly
to them. In other words, it has
character. Not much negative
feedback; but I take it in con-
sideration when delivered.
Much love to all. Since I gradu-
ate in December, from that
point on, DITC may be no
more; but that doesn’t stop any
of you from coming up here
and doing the same thing that I
did (but with your own title, of
course). If you’re here in the
summer, you may catch me
here doin’ DITC and maybe a
little something with Urban
Entertainment, a free newspa-
per like In Pittsburgh. Keep
your eyes peeled for that. This
is not gonna be the usual DITC,
since it’s the year—end edition.
Before I do, I gotta say one
“love and eternal peace” to
Erica Bowman; we miss you.
The 40 D’s for putting on fat
shows Tuesday nights. Angie
Corley for the future ﬂavor.
“Sandman” Smith for the
Underground Hip‘ Hop Video
Magazine. WPTS for standing
behind me when sh*t gets
thick. Congrats to BKB, Jen,
“Slow FloW,” and anybody I
may have missed who is gradu-
ating and are down with me;
I’ll be joining ya soon.

I started to review the UMC’s
(Undisputed Masters of
Charisma) second effort
Unleashed, but it wasn’t that
hot and it would’ve only
received @@@. Truthfully, with
this group, from the looks of
things, they’ve already released
the right songs off of the album
(“Time To Set It Straight,”
“Hit The Track” b/w “Some
Speak Ill Thoughts”). They
traded smiles for scowls and
their music" has taken a notice-
ably different swing from the
days of-“Blue Cheese” and
“One To Grow On.” They’ve
traded fades for dreds. Even
their flow has changed; fortu-

 {E  ,   l E Eff‘; ix 'Ir“¢“r

nately it was for the better. The
flow is tight, lyrics are OK, and
the music is “sucker’s fare”
(nothing special at all). Find
someone with the album and
give it a listen to pass your
own judgment.
Instead, I had to do this 

Artist: Nas

Album: Illmatic

Producer(s): Premier, Pete
Rock, Large Professor, Q-Tip,
L.E.S.

label: Columbia/ Sony

rating: @@@@

I would’ve been dead wrong
if I didn’t review this album.
Here’s some conclusions I
came up with. The second
coming of Rakirn? Naw. A clas-
sic five-point album? Hell No!
Dope? Yeah. Overhyped and
overpublicized? Definitely. Nas
is dope. Nas has skill. Without
a doubt, Nas can crush an army
of wannabees with one
freestyle. Nas’ album is 80 per-
cent better than Snoop’s.

When I read the interview
with Nas in the Source, they
said he went through 70 tracks
at the least. Out of the 70 plus
tracks he went through, he
handpicked the 10 that would
make up his album (nine actual
songs; “Genesis” is nothing
more than an intro). Being that
finicky made me curious; plain
and simple, I had to have it. I
just knew those 10 had to be
the rawest tracks on earth. Inch
by inch, the album was
released to me. First, it was
“Halftime.” Large Professor
(or Extra P, as he’s been called
as of late) hooked him up well
with a plain, but extremely
rugged track. “Joe The
Butcher” was no slouch on the
remix either. Then came “It
Ain’t Hard To Tell.” Even after
the wide acceptance that SWV
received with Human Nature
break, Nas and Extra P made it
happen again. Undeniable fla-
vor, but still not classic. Then

TI-IEPITT NEWS, Thurs y,A ri121,

1994
on the serious dl, I received
“NY State Of Mind” and “The
World Is Yours.”  is sin-
gle-handedly the phattest song
that Nas has delivered.
Premier (Primo) gave him the
track of life with a crazy piano
that represents what Illmatic
should be about. I saw prob-
lems with “The World.” It
didn’t truly have that standout
“listen to me” flavor that the
other had. The track was phat,
but it was missing something.
Pete didn’t help any by that
annoying-ass singing of his. It’s
just an average song.

Upon purchasing the album
on Tuesday, I was not
impressed. The best chemistry
on the album came about with
Nas and Extra P. All of the
songs that they’ve done togeth-
er are the sh*t!! Airtight and
rock-solid. Him and Premier
are another beautiful marriage.
Primo showed his ass on
“Represent.” It’s some old
happy psychotic next shizz
with a smooth, laid-ba'ck feel.

.:--;r-..-vt’ ‘-*‘rv'~.:-.4“ 1'.-‘1>

My problems arise with “One _

Love.” The track is dope sepa-
rately, the lyrics are dope sepa-
rately, but the two together are
like the Valdez Oil spill; they
don’t mix. Q-Tip took notes
from Pete and sung the chorus,
which truly throws the song off
entirely. “Life’s A Bitch” is not
happening at all. No one in
their right mind should be rap-
pin’ over The Gap Band’s
“Yearning For Your Love.”
L.E.S. could’ve kept that track
to himself.

Please don’t get me wrong;
the album is dope. For nine
tracks, the album could’ve been
a lot tighter. I guess I’m so criti-
cal because of the hype and
the $22 I spent to find out that
it didn’t live up to it ($11 per
wax). For tape, it’s a solid pur-
chase. Personal opinion: I’d
buy Gangstarr first.

Instead of the Starting 5,
since everyone’s going home,
I’ll give you things to look for.

The Notorious B-I-G
(Biggie Smalls): No release
date for his album, but, if
you’re from the New York area,
try to find the song he has out
now on the underground called
“Dreams of F**kin’ An R&B
B**ch.” The lyrics are silly as
hell, over a classic James
Brown break. It’s “ghetto corne-
dy,” as he calls it. It’s raw; I
wore it out. He also has a song
with The Method Man. BIG
got some sh*t for that ass.

3rd Eye: If you have the
Wbo’s The Man Soundtrack,
you’re familiar with this kid.

' Jesse West, aka 3rd Eye, has

 

some ill-extra-next-to—your-
chest sh"t. Look for it on PMD
Records. I’m not gonna spill
the beans on this one; just get
it when you see it.

Jeru The Damaja: The Sun
Rises In The East is due out
next month. Look for more of
that East New York (read:
Brooklyn) -flavor. 4D. Original
is speaking loud right now.

Redman: If any of you have
heard the Tonight’s Da Night
remix, as well as production
jobs for groupslike Quo, Mel-
Low, and soon for the upcom-
mg Doo Wop project on

Velocity Girl
Simpatico!
SubPop

It’s been almost a year since
the four boys and one girl
from Silver Springs, Md.,
recorded their debut album,
Copacetic, and they have been
pretty busy. In 10 months,
they conquered 125 stages,
including D.C.’s RFK Stadium.
Their debut didn’t have me in
tears of joy, and I’m a Velocity
Girl junkie, but there are major
differences with Simpaiico!

Jim Spellman of Velocity Girl
said, “One hundred twenty-
five shows in 10 months; it
makes you realize what’s
important.” Bob Weston, from
the school of Steve Albini, pro-
duced Copacetic with the idea
of recording Velocity Girl as
they sound like practicing.
John Porter, producer of The
Smiths and two-time Grammy
Award nominee, took Velocity
Girl away from the sound and
Jim explained the situation.

“I think our songs are
improving, not because we
have a producer, just because
we’re getting better as a group

. so that’s one whole thing.
This is a whole different thing.
We want a produced sound, a

lush kind of big sound,” he
said.

The first “lush kind of big
sound” single is “Sorry Again,”
and the comparisons between
Velocity Girl’s sound to The
Breeders’ are going to be
many. It’s a simple silly pop
song. It’s the same familiar
pop song with catchy lyrics
and_ girlish vocals, but Sarah’s
vocals will woo any male vic-
tim.

“Tripping Wire,” “The All
Consumer,” “Drug Girls” and
“Medio Core” continue the
jamboree. This album includes
something the band did while
they were releasing 7” singles
on Slumberland, more boy
vocals. I like Archie (he talked
to me at their show). On
“Medio Core,” he duals with
Sarah, and the song results as
a personification of Velocity
Girl. Wooooohooo  it’s so
damn poppy.

I have been shooting up on
the indie drug for about two
years, and it’s so damn hard to
kick the habit (like I wanna
kick it), and then I listen
“Labrador,” it gets me so high.

Velocity Girl has definitely
grown into a pop rock mon-
ster, and it seems pop rock is
the thing to be (i.e. Belly, The

Breeders and Shoen Knife). So
where will they go from here?
Anywhere they want.

Milla
The Divine Comedy
SBK

Hole .
Live Through This
DGC

More female artists than ever
are out playing music that
rivals the work of their male
peers. Unfortunately, people
like Lida Husik, Lois and all-
female bands like Zuzu’s
Petals get lost in the shuffle,
and notoriety goes to groups
that can scream the loudest or
because of aspects totally
unrelated to the music itself.
It’s sadly ironic, since the
aforementioned groups make
better music than the testos-
terone crowd.

Milla and Courtney Love,
who fronts Hole, are two
women who would probably
receive more attention for who
they are instead of what they
play. One of those women has
risen above the hype and
made a significant record. The
other proves that “the look”
unfortunately is more impor-
tant than a good song.

Eighteen-year—old Milla
Jovovich has been a model
since her mid-teens. She
appeared in a few films as
well, most recently Dazed and
Confused. Apparently, she
writes songs too, because 10
of the 11 songs on The Divine
Comedy list her as writer or
co-writer. While it’s an impres-
sive feat, the music — and the
whole package — show the

trappings of a nascent song-
writer not quite ready for pub-
lic consumption. '

Most of the songs feature
simple, forgettable, synth-
laden riffs played with little
variation and the words sung
over them. Half the time, Milla
sounds so much like Kate
Bush that the latter ought to
get her lawyers on the phone.
Other times she resembles
Sinéad O’Connor.
Unfortunately, Milla lacks both
Bush’s eccentricity and
O’Connor’s passion, which
doesn’t leave her with much.

The whole album reeks of
an oh—so—serious attitude in
packaging as well as music. Its

The Feminine Mistake
by Cal Samra

Nash Publishing

1971

Gay Is Not Good

by Frank du Mas

Thomas Nelson, Inc.

1979

Answers to 200 of Life’s
Most Probing Questions
by Pat Robertson

Bantam Books

1988

America is cursed, or should
I say blessed, by its right wing.
Life may beharder if you don’t
toe their line, yet without
America’s right, where would
all of life’s struggles be?

I like to think of the right as
a cultural monosodium gluta-
mate — MSG. You certainly
don’t want to use a lot when
you cook. Too much will give
you a headache, but just the
right amount accents the ﬂavor
of the dish.

For example, rock ‘n’ roll
would just be music without
the right. For some of
America’s right-wing, rock ‘n’
roll is the spawn of Satan -— a
demonic curse from the lower
depths of hell. Others accuse
rockers of tempting children to
do all sorts of nasty things. The
right blames calamities on
heavy metal. Rock ‘n’ roll
wouldn’t be the same without
the right.

Over the last few years, I
have been reading the right for
pleasure, to kill time and just
for fun. I offer as perfect bath-
room reading these three titles.

779e Feminine Mistalee, not to
be confused with Betty
Friedan’s classic The Feminine

Mystique, can be found through

the University of Pittsburgh
library system. I first saw this
book while looking for a title
by anti-ERA crusader, Phyllis
Schlafly.

Published in cooperation
with the Society for the
Emancipation of the American
Male, The Feminine Mista/ee
attributes all sorts of problems
to women. This is a common
tactic employed by the right. If

I i you don’t like someone or
 some ideas, blame them for

any number of social ills.

For Samra, once universities
began to accept women, all
hell broke loose on campus. I
thought ‘60s campus rebellions
had more do to with Vietnam,
but Samra gives his own inter-
pretation.

He writes, “Indeed the level
of violence in the once peace-
ful town of Ann Arbor
appeared to increase almost in
direct proportion to the num-
ber of coeds enrolled at the
University of Michigan  By
the end of the ‘60s, idyllic Ann
Arbor was racked by student
riots, confrontations, bomb-
throwings, muggings, assaults,
and the community was terror-
ized by a series of coed slay-
ings.” All sorts of problems are
attributed to liberated women
in the Mistalee, even including
insanity in men.

The Mistake concludes with a
Declaration of Independence
chastising women who do any-
thing but bake cookies.
Women should devote “them-
selves to the feminine arts and

creating happy homes.”
Somehow, men get off the
hook for making homes better
for families.

Gay Is Not Good is out of
print, but it can be found at the
Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic library. I am still try-
ing to snatch up my own copy;
it’s worth it.

Du Mas writes in the preface,
“this book is the culmination of
years of research on homosex-
uality.” Yet for a title published
in 1979, his research was
behind the times. His most
recent reference was a Rolling
Stone article from 1974; the
mean date for the research
cited was 1963.

A clinical psychologist, du
Mas does not appeal to any sci-
entific methodology of which I
am aware. Under the heading
of “biological considerations,”
he informs without any citation,

“If one desires the fullest possi-
ble sex life, with the most plea-
sure and maximum sensuality,
then heterosexuality is the
obvious choice. Variety and dif-
ference counteract boredom;
homosexuals are more alike
and less different from each
other than heterosexuals.
Variety has been called the
only true aphrodisiac; hetero-
sexuality involves greater vari-
ety between two most different
individuals.”

If individuals are not attract-
ed to members of an opposite
sex, why would “heterosexuali-
ty” lead to the fullest possible
sex life? Faking feelings must
not be Very rewarding.

Bordering on the bizarre,
under the heading, “Universal

-Heterosexual Love,” du Mas

appeals to fairy tale characters
to support his case for manda-
tory heterosexuality. He

   STUDENT

GVERNMENT

 

observes that, “Mother Nature
and Father Time put it together
for the heterosexual.”

Pat Robertson’s Answers will
amuse all who visit the throne.
Here are 200 short questions. I
won’t comment on his theolog-
ical opinions, just keep in mind
this is the same man who
claimed he altered a hurricane’s
path by praying at Virginia
Beach. Too bad for the suckers
who got blasted instead.

“Do seances, Ouija boards
and fortune-telling lead to
demonic possession?”
Robertson answers yes, “All
these things are sins against
God  They are also potential
sources for demon possession.”
Next time your are in Toys R
Us, watch out. Parker Brothers’
Ouija boards open the gates of
Hades. Dungeons and Dragons
also take a beating.

But what about cunnilingus

S-7

or fellatio. “Is oral sex okay?”
For the man with all the
answers, he leaves this one up
in the air. He perceptively
points out that oral sex is non-
procreative. Yet for married
folks, it’s OK, maybe.

“Is acupuncture wrong?” He
responds, “I feel that the reli-
gious or metaphysical justifica-
tion given for acupuncture by
the Chinese and Koreans is not
in accord with the Bible and is
wrong.” Non—Christian religions
and spiritualities are likened to
a demonic world.

Robertson warns that hypno-
sis is wrong because “submis-
sion is inviting trouble and
danger.” I couldn’t agree more.
Too bad Robertson followers
don’t hear this message.

From creating paintings of
soup cans to directing day—long
films of the Empire State
Building; from producing a
rock and rollband called the
Velvet Underground to starting
a magazine and even managing
to get shot, Andy Warhol was
one of Americas busiest artists.

Born and raised in
Pittsburgh, he gained notoriety
by painting electric chairs, sui—
cides and Marilyn Monroe back
in the 15665.

Notoriety still follows \X/arhol,
even after his death in 1987. It
is fitting that on Friday the 13th
of this May, The Andy \X/arhol
Museum will celebrate its grand
opening.

The Andy Warhol Museum
will offer students creative
inspiration as well as educa-
tional opportunities through a

series of programs and facilities
slated to begin this fall.

”The Andy Warhol Museum
will be like having Frank Lloyd
\X/right’s Fallingwater in
Pittsburgh,” said Anne Weis,
chairperson of Pitt’s Fine Arts
Department. Weis said that the
Warhol will be a major
resource for Pitt students. She
added that students can go to
see an archive of objects,
which includes \X/arl1ol’s first
soup—can painting from 1960,
all from an artist who has been
in textbooks.

The Warhol has over 900
paintings and sculptures that
will be intermittently displayed
over eight floors of gallery
space. There will be 500 works
on view at any time. Warl1ol’s

It all began .last
October. when I was
watching “Late Show with
l)avid Letterman“ with
some of my friends. when
they said, "Wouldn't it be
cool to go see a taping of
Dave?" \‘(/ell, the next day
I called Telefact for the
phone. number of CBS in
New York City. After a
minute. I had the number
and found myself talking
to a CBS operator. She
said all you have to do is

good luck. I had my post-
card in the mail that
night.

Six months later, I had
the tickets in my hand.
My next problem was get-
ting to the Big Apple.
Without a car, and with
no money for a plane
ticket, I resorted to a bus.
It was nine hours of hell
(each way), but'I kept
reminding myself, "I am
going to see l)ave.” I was
lucky enough to have
someone along with me

who had never been to

N.Y.C. We got there early

and played the tourist,

going to Rockefeller

and the Hard Rock Cafe.
We went to the camera

ing the Ed Sullivan
Theater and all frequent-
ed by Dave. They look
just like they do on TV,
and every time they show
l)ave going in there, I say
to whoever is watching
with me, “I was there, it
was so cool!"

The line to get in start-
ed at 3 p.m., and we.
were there at 3:15, putting
us 25th and 26th in line..
At 4:50, they let us...i_n the

we got to our seats, it was

Bad Girls

Written by Ken Freidman and
Yolande Finch

Directed by Jonathan Kaplan
Starring Madeleine Stowe, Mary

Stuart Masterson, Andie
MacDowell and Drew
Barrymore

 

How long has it been since
Hollywood released a movie

with a strong, dominant
woman in the lead role? Maybe
Silence of [be Lambs. How long
has it been since a movie has
had two leading women? I’m
thinking T/ae/ma and Louise.
Well what about a movie with
four leading women, who are
not only defiant, but are cast in
what is usually a male genre?
Did you say never? Then you
would be right.

Not until the movie Bad Girls
has there been a major Western
made starring women. Women

who are self-sufficient, and‘

who don’t rely on their male
co-stars to get them through

life’s little problems.

This is a story of four women
who run a prostitution ring and
are devoted friends. For one
reason or another they have
been forced to fend for them-
selves in the Wild West, and in
the process found they could
count on each other. Their
main goal is to travel to
Oregon together, but along the
way they run into trouble and
some outlaws. But no matter
what the circumstances, they
are individuals, yet true to each
other as companions and part-
ners.

Cody Zamora (Madeleine
Stowe) plays the role of a crafty
ex-outlaw who has taken the
part of being pimp and protec-
tor of the group. At the begin-
ning of the movie she is saved
by her three friends from being
hanged after she kills one of
Anita Crown’s (Mary Stuart
Masterson) abusive clients.
Anita is much the mother of the
group and has been forced into
prostitution after the death of
her husband. She takes the role
of the emotionally supportive
figure to Eileen Spenser (Andie

MacDowell) and Lilly Laronette
(Drew Barrymore), and even
Cody when she lets her.

All the women, except for
Cody, are free—spirited but not
accustomed to shooting and
robbing people. Throughout
the movie, they never kill or
rob simply for money. Their
entire goal is to quit prostitu-
tion and go to Oregon to be
with each other and start a saw
mill. This allows them to get
away with a lot and still seem
justified, since they only do
what is necessary to their goal
and they seem helpless to the
circumstances around them. It
takes the other three time to
adjust to being outlaws and
getting into shoot—outs. But by
the end of the movie, everyone
of them looks like a gun slinger
who has no qualms about
killing those who wrong them
and taking what they need to
survive. Anita is one of the last
to come around. But when she
finds out that her and her hus-
band’s claim can’t be cashed in
because she’s a woman, she
realizes that she doesn’t have

She says, “Your laws don’t
include me, so they don’t apply
to me.” This, in general,
becomes the theme of the
movie.

I had my doubts going into
the theater, wondering if this
would be just another cheesy
plot by Hollywood in which
the women would be shown
off in tight western clothes, rid-
ing fast horses just to make
money. I wondered if there
would be strong characters
who would then become obe-
dient when a man was around,
but this never happens. They
fall in love and deal almost
entirely with men, but they
never back down, and the men
never dominate the scenes or
expect the women to become
subservient. And no matter
what the situation, they are
loyal to each other.

So if you want to see what
good acting and writing can be
done by and about women, or
if you just want to check out
the horses and shoot-outs, this
movie is a must-see. Just leave
your stereotypes at the door.

Within the next five days, saxophone fans will have
a chance to hear two vastly different saxophonists
who have changed the way the instrument is played
and viewed. Tonight, tenor saxophonist Eddie Harris
will perform as part of a concert by The University of
Pittsburgh Jazz Ensemble. Tuesday night, multi-saxo-
phonist Peter Brotzmann will bring his trio to town.

Although Eddie Harris primarily plays tenor, he has
also recorded playing piano and trumpet, and he can
scat up a storm.

Since his recording debut in 1961, he has handled
commercial success without sacrificing showing off his
chops. Originally his style recalled the smooth sound
of Stan Getz, but he eventually moved onto electric
funk.

Harris also made innovations with the instruments
he played. He receiveda patent for the reed trumpet,

 

where the brass instrument is played with a saxo-
phone mouthpiece. He also pioneered the electric sax-
ophone, which is played with a special mouthpiece.

Saxophonist Peter Brotzmann might object to
appearing in an article with Harris (and vice versa),
but such is the history of this music.

Since the mid ‘60s Brotzmann has been a strong
voice in the free jazz and improvisation movement.
Since starting the Free Music Production label in
Europe, Brotzmann recorded with Last Exit, an all-star
band which featured guitarist Sonny Sharrock, bassist
Bill Laswell and drummer Ronald _Shannon Jackson.
The quartet’s music sounds loose and disjointed, but

THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, April 21, 1994

all four members play with such a fire and passion
that you can’t help but latch onto them.

On Tuesday, Brotzmann will perform with bassist
William Parker and drummer Gregg Bendian. Both
men sport a wealth of musical experiences which
includes their tenure with free music pioneer pianist
Cecil Taylor.

40 Stories, who play a tight blend of free jazz and
funk grooves, will open for Brotzmann.

Yhursday, April 21, Eddie Harris will perform with the
University of Pittsburgh jazz Ensemble in the William
Pitt Union. 8p.m.

“Failure Is OK!”

No, this has nothing to do
with all of those tests you’ve
been taking lately, but it is
one of the rules at Friday Nite
Improvs. What is FNI? Well, ‘
as Chris Potocki, the wacky yet loveable host
of ‘Provs likes to say, “It’s the only audience-
participation improvisational theater east of
the Mississippi.”

If that doesn’t answer your question, let me
try again.

When someone does an improvisation, say
in the game of “Freeze,” they come up with a
situation (what they’re doing), and a character
(who they are), and go with it. There are sev-
eral different games that are played during the
evening and, perhaps most importantly, no
cast. That’s right, everyone who gets onstage
does it voluntarily, and anyone who comes
can participate if they so desire.

Let me give you an example of a typical
evening at FNI. The show (so to speak) Opens
with a song by the house band, then Chris
welcomes the audience and gives out the
rules. Yes, rules. One of them is the aforemen-
tioned “Failure is okay.” That means that,
because everyone is there to have fun, if
someone tries out an idea for a situation or a
character and it doesn’t quite work the way
that they expected, it’s OK, it’s all in fun and
there’s no pressure.

To go along with that idea, all participants

IMPROV

are welcomed onstage with a
round of applause, and no
booing is allowed. Another
rule is that “This is not the-
atre,” which means that there
are no actors, no costumes,
no script, just you and your ideas. As Chris
likes to remind everyone, we all played
“make—be1ieve” as kids; this is your opportuni-
ty to give it another try.

After the rules are given the gaming begins.
Some of the games include “Toys,” where a
box of random objects are spilled out onto the
stage and the people who decide to play use
them for whatever they want, or “Poets,”
where the game host will choose volunteers
from the audience to come on stage, create a
character or theme, solicit subjects for the
poems from the audience, and let the poets
wax away. Another game, and probably the
most well-known, is the game of “Freeze.”
Two people begin the game with a situation
and relationship given to them from the other
audience members. When the scene has pro-
gressed through a beginning, middle and is
approaching an end, anyone can “freeze in,”

' tag one of the two players out, and begin a

completely new scene of their own, and so on
until the end of the game. .

Also, every week there is also “Showcase,”

which is a forum for any interested audience
member to showcase a talent, whether it be

Warhol

Continued from page S-8

Warhol’s early magazine illus-
trations of women’s shoes and
attire, from the ‘40s and ‘50s, to
his self portraits, painted in
vivid orange and red, done as
late as the mid—80s.

Warhol collected a plethora
of off-the-wall items, such as a
stuffed Great Dane which once
belonged to film director Cecil
B. DeMille. Broderick was quite
excited to say that these items,
as well as photos of Warhol
with his celebrity friends, will
be placed alongside the art-
work. According to Broderick,
this will give the viewer a con-
text in which Warhol was
working. Broderick said that
one will be able to see all the
things that were influencing
Warhol. If it was not Mick
Jagger, it was a box of Brillo
pads.

Besides displaying Warhol’s
art, the museum will offer a
program called The Weekend
Factory. Not open until the fall,
this program will mimic
Warhol’s famous New York stu-
dio called The Factory.
Broderick said it will function
like a class studio with a lot of
hands-on activities. The
,Weekend Factory will show a
visitor how Warhol mixed his

‘ paints and inks, made his prints

and prepared his canvases. In
an afternoon, one can see how
Warhol created the works of art
which made him so famous.

The Weekend Factory will
have an interactive computer
where anyone can bring a
photo and make a print. “One
will go through the same men-
tal processes Warhol went
through,” Broderick said.
Visitors will have to edit their
photos and choose their colors
just the way Warhol would
have to have done.

The educational programs
will not start until the fall
because of the rush to get
everything on display in the
museum. “We want everything
to be just right [in the muse-

uml,” Broderick said.

Students will be able to see
any one of Warhol’s 60 ﬁlms at
no extra cost. In the Warhol’s
theater, one could View such
films as “Sleep,” an eight-hour
film showing a man in bed
sleeping, or “The Chelsea
Girls,” a film that shows two
separate images on the screen.

The Warhol will offer quali-
fied college students semester-
long internships and one-to-
two year apprenticeships.

Brodericksaid the internships
are non—paid, temporary posi-
tions for college students
majoring in fine arts, art histo-
ry, education and related fields.
interning students will do a
number of jobs from research
to public relations.

The apprenticeships are paid,
one-to-two year positions for
students with a degree in the
arts or education. The appren-
ticeships offered are designed
for people who want to go into
museum education, said
Broderick. The apprentices will
help with the day-to—day run-
ning of the museum.

The Warhol will offer an
extensive bookstore and a cafe.
The first floor, strewn with
couches and portraits of
Warhol, will be open for peo-
ple to hang out, said Broderick.

The Warhol is located on the
North Side on 117 Sandusky
Street. It occupies the old

Volkwein building which used

to be a music store and ware-
house.

The museum will be officially
open to the public at 11 a.m.
on Monday, May 16th.
Introductory week hours will
be 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday and
Sunday; and 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.,
Thursday through Saturday.

Regular hours will be 11 a.m.
to 6 p.m., Wednesday and
Sunday; and 11 a.m. to 8 pm.
Thursday through Saturday.
The museum will be closed
Monday and Tuesday.

“Don’t yell out during the tap-
ing. You may think you are
being cool, but when it comes
on the TV, you sound like a
schmutz.” Then he said, “The
one thing we do need you to

do is clap. When the applause .

lights flash, I want to hear
some noise!”

Then the band started play-
ing, they showed the credits
and before I knew it Dave was
doing his monologue. During
the commercials, Dave sat back
and smokes a cigar and the
band played. They had moni-
tors spread out all over the
audience, so you could see it
exactly like it would be on TV.
When the show is over, the
ushers show you out as quickly
as they showed you in.

So now that you know what
to do, get a postcard and write
for tickets. If you write now,
you may have them by

go, remember to get there early
and take a snowsuit! Good

heard it. Methinks she inhaled
too much on the set of Dazed
and Confused. C

Courtney Love doesn’t seem
like a person with her head
screwed on that straight. On
Hole’s debut album, she
wailed like a banshee while
her bandmates churned out a
sloppy brew of sludge and
noise. It sounded pretty
unimaginative to these ears,
like a third Babes in Toyland
(whom I don’t like either).

For the band’s second
album, they’ve moved to DGC,
the home of Love’s late hus-
band Kurt Cobain. And 
something happened. Hole has
improved by leaps and
bounds.

Instead of grinding out
another endurance test, Live
Through This is a powerful
album in which Love comes
across like a combination of
Patti Smith and Polly Harvey.
That comparison might sound
ambitious, but Love’s intense
lyrics and no—holds-barred
delivery entitle her to it.

Love sings instead of just
barking this time out. And

dices. Billy offers advice on
how to keep a good Christian
marriage together in the eyes of
God.

One good Christian asks,
“Many nights each week my
husband doesn’t come home
until nearly twelve o’clock. I
still love him and don’t want a
divorce. What should I do?”

Billy advises, “Tell your hus-
band you love him, and try to
show it in little ways. Don’t
greet him with nagging and
complaints. When you expect
him home see that the house is
in order, and be careful of your
personal appearance as you did
in the days when he was court-
ing you. If it is his pleasure,
arrange more often to go out
with him. Set aside a time each
day to read the Bible and pray
together.”

Graham asks that the wife be
good to a husband unfaithful to
her. Telling her to clean the

house and act pretty, hoping

her husband will see his sins,
instead of telling her to con-

front him or leave him. Many
times throughout this book,
Graham gives advice saying
that the wife should be patient
with the husband and God will
bring him back. That maybe
she could be doing more to
ensure he will stick around,
and blaming the wife that she
is the cause of her husband’s
cheating. But if she prays hard
enough, he will return to her
and the Church and repent.
Meanwhile, in real life, the wife
becomes depressed and feels
unwanted, the husband contin-
ues to cheat and probably soon
leaves her and the children are
left to watch their parents split,
all the while wondering why
God lets things like this hap-
pen. And your basic nuclear
family is left to pick up their
shattered lives.

Another question is, “Should
a Christian participate in
defense measures of war
involving the use of weapons,
considering that his purpose is
to kill other children of God?”

Billy responds, “First of all,
the purpose of war is not to kill
other children of God. If they
are killed through the ravages
of war, it is because they are
members of a warring society
and incidentally Christians. A
Christian would find it hard to
be a loyal citizen in a nation
that promoted warfare. We can
thank God that we are part of a
nation that seeks to solve all
problems by peaceful means.”

Well, thank goodness that we
don’t live in a country that pro-
motes warfare. We are lucky
enough to live in a nation that
would not war over something
that could be resolved by
peaceful means, like oil. And it
is certainly the Serbs and
Croats’ fault that they are in a
warring society, even though
they probably pray to God
every day to save them.

Graham offers a lot of
answers for his followers, but it
makes me wonder what he
really offers them as advice. He
shows them through a blind

faith, each time telling them to
sacrifice and pray. He doesn’t
allow them a free will, only
what he has determined as
God’s will. If these people fol-
low his words, they may
become much worse off than
when they started out and take
friends and family with them
into the situation. Billy’s end —
heaven — justifies the means,
sacrificing self. Is it really
Christian to teach people to set-
tle for what they are given by
God and pray for the strength
to accept it, as if they have no
choice in the matter?

I’m just glad they didn’t ask
him many sex questions.

“Is it wrong to pet?”

“This question, because of its
delicacy, has been evaded by
some columnists. You have
asked a sincere question, and
I’m going to give you my sin-
cere answer. Happy is the per-
son who marries a mate who
has not been pawed over.”

Thanks for your advice, Billy.

Virgin Records, then you have
a feel of what his next album
(production-wise, at least).
Who knows what the flow will
be? If it’s anything like the flow
presented on E. Sermon’s
album, Tonight’s remix and
Jodeci’s album, brace your-

selves.

PMD: With his ex-partner
droppin’ a lil’ sumthin’-phat,
“retirement” or not, you know
he had to represent. Still carry-
ing the Hit Squad name, Parrish
sounds like he has something
in the works. With cameos by
3rd Eye, Das Efx, Top
Quality and others, look for
this album to blow up like July
4th.

Smif-N-Wessun: If
Bucktown is representation
that Tek and Steele are gonna
catch wrek this summer, then
it’s not a false one. With the
help of their boys and produc-
ers, Black Moon, Crooklyn will
be well represented this sum-
mer.

Crooklyn Soundtrack: All
together phat, but the surprise
will by the Crooklyn
Dodgers. This group is com-
prised of Buckshot Shorty,
Masta Ase, and... Special Ed!
Definitely somethin’ to keep
your ears open for!!

There is definitely plenty
more, but I’m running out of
space. I’m out, but I’ll leave
you with this one thought. If
you’d like to see the ‘Crates run
consistently in the fall (read:
every week), talk to the editor
of the entire The Pitt News and
tell her to expand the size of
the Showcase, otherwise you’ll
be stuck with articles on cheat-
ing, picking a roommate, or my
personal favorite, pictures of
Remus cutting trees in the sum-
mer or people sunbathing on
the Cathedral lawn with dirty
feet (both came courtesy of my
man DeeTee). So speak out
and make ‘em clock the time
like Big Ben. One love to all
and I’m outta here.

the spotlight to Love’s dark
but moving lyrics.

Speaking of which, the
album ends with what could
be a new rock anthem. Or
should I say anti-anthem. In
“Rock Star,” Love trashes the
scene in Olympia, Wash., and
really, the other such scenes
like it in that state and
around the country. “What do
you do with a revolution?! 
We look the same/we talk the
same/ we even f——-k the

- same.” It’s equally funny and

rocking.

Due to recent events,
Courtney Love will probably
be labeled Mrs. Kurt Cobain
from now on. A lot has been
written about her lately; very
little of it good. A recent
interview in Option made her
out to be a rich self—centered
bitch obsessed with her
image.

And maybe she is.

So what.

Don’t read the articles, just
listen to the music. Love
writes great songs, and her
band rules. And next to
Gumball, they might just be
one of the best rock bands in
the country.
