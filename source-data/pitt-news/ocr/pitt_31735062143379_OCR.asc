Men's Fraternities to Pick
New Pledges from 600
Eligible Freshmen

No Limit T. Affairs  

W'ith approximately 600 freshmen
eligible to pledge to fraternities,
men's campus social organizations
are planning extensive rushing cam-
paigns to begin at 8:30 o'clock next
Friday morning.

A total of 544 advanced first year
men, who have attained 12-credit, 8-
quality point ratings, will be eligible
for pledgeship, along with approxi-
mately 60 incoming freshmen. Of the

544 men, 80 students refused bids the .
first semester who indicated that they .

might accept this semester. Upper-
classmen who also have earned 12
credits and 8 quality points this last
semester may be approached by fra-
ternities for pledgeship.

The period of rushing, beginning
Friday, will extend to 2 o'clock, Sun-
day morning, February 26. During
this time fra.ternities may sponsor an
unlimited number of social
though all dances must take place on-
Friday or on Saturday nights. Most
events will be in the form of informal
theater parties, smokers, and bridge
sessions.

During silence period, from 2:00
o'clock Sunday morning, February 26,
until Wednesday, March 1_, no frater-

nity member o'r'pledge" may speak to '

any newly regist’er'ed freshman or. to
any other student who has been rush-
ed by his fraternity. Through this
time, the rushees will be expected to
determine their choices of fraterni-
ties, and advise the Office of the Dean
of Men as to their decisions. Ac-
ceptances and refusals of bids will be
transmitted to the affected fraterni-
ties as promptly as possible by the

- (mice of the Dean of Men.

All invitations to pledge to fraterni-
ties will come directly from the Of-
ﬁce of the Dean of Men, and from
there only. Both rushees and frater-
nities are warned by Interfraternity
Council neither to accept or refuse
bids nor to extend them through any
other mediums.

At no time during rushing season is
any rushee to remain over night in a
fraternity house or in the home of any
fraternity member or pledge.

In view of past rushing season re-
sults, approximately 150 freshmen
will be the recipients of bids, believe

“Get Going!”

Cant,-or Jokes. Gives
“Success” Recipe
F or Students

 

“Mr. Cantor, what do you think
of a 37-story Cathedral of Learn-
ing as a place of higher educa-
tion?"

"Oh, you're trying to make
jokes! Well, when we make
jokes, we talk to one-sixth of the
United States.”

Cantor was staying at Rubin-
off’s home last Thursday evening,
hemmed in by autograph seekers,
high school reporters, and other
parasites, just before he left for
the Mosque to begin his evening
show.

Asked for his own “success”
recipe, the comedian expounded:

“When you were a. kid and
wanted to ride a bike, what did
you do? You took abike and
rode. Perhaps you fell, but you
eventually learned. That's what
to do if you want to go on the
stage, or even if you wish to suc-
ceed as a reporter.”

“What are your daughters do-
ing, Mr. Cantor-l11n——Eddie?”
The answer came back rather too
suddenly: “One is going to U. S.
C., and she had a very, very ﬁne
time on New Year's Day. I think
it was a football game she saw.”
The Pitt News buried its mast-
head.

Kyser’s Band-
Booked For
Junior Prom

Unanimous Vote Spikes
Dissension Rumors as
Committee Meets

 

§Prepa-re Novel Favors

1

  

Kay Kyser and his nationally fa-
mous orchestra will be heard at the
Junior Prom. next Friday, according
'to the decision reached recently by the
Junior Prom committee. Showing
signs of unusual unanimity and co-
operation the committee, at a special
meeting during examination week,
spiked rumors of disagreement in its
ranks and continued developing the
extensive planswhich had been pre-
_vi_ously laid out by the group.

Following -the almost unanimous
vote and the pledge of cooperation,
William Kellar, Col., chairman of the
dance, said, “Rumors that the com-
mittee members ‘are disagreeing
among themselves are baseless. We
intend to Sponsor the best dance of
the year and this unanimous vote
proves it.”

Shortly following

‘tion of Kay Kyser and his orchestra
to play at the annual Junior affair.
Kyser heads one of the nation's more
popular dance bands and has been ob-
tained through the convenience of his
Iitinerary-..which~takes. him to Cleve-
land's popular (lance spot, The Gold-
en Pheasant, next week. The selec-
5‘tion of Kyser’s band came after an
hour of deliberation in the special
committee meeting.

A novel favor has been designed for
the affair and promises to be the
most interesting innovation oﬁered at
any University dance this year. The
committees on decorations and adver-
tising have been working overtime in

the plans of the committee.

Standing united behind their previ-
-ous position, the committee members
upheld the $3.75 per couple admission‘
tax and insisted that it represented a
substantial reduction from the price
charged for the Junior Prom last
year. Tickets are being sold_by _all
members of the committee. Reserva-
tion tickets are offered at $1.00 -and
may be exchanged at special places
which will be named later by the
committee.

‘Incomplete Figures Show
Many Yet to Register;
Continue‘ Week

175 Enroll Wednesday

Registration in all campus schools
up to 5 o'clock Wednesday, amounted
to 4,096, of whom ninety-two were in-
coming freshmen, according to Reg-
istrar John G. Quick. The total reg-
istration this year is 90.4 per cent of
1932's total which, up to the same
time, was 4,526. “This freshman
class can be looked upon as fairly
large in consideration of the times,"
was the observation of Mr. Quick.

The total number of new students
for the second semester, including in-
coming freshmen and transfers, up to
Wednesday at 5 o'clock, was 287,
which is 84 per cent of the 342 who
had enrolled up to the same time in
February, 1932. It is likely that even

transfers will register today and next
week, To show that registration is

to a close, the comparative figures“ on
total registration for Wednesday are‘

1933, 175 students registered, as‘
against the 158 who enrolled on Wed-
nesday, February 10, 1932.
Pre-regis.t,ration ﬁgures show the
good use which was made of this facil-
ity. Of the 3,355 who made use of it
during January, all ‘except about 300
will take the ﬁnal step toward com-
plete registration. These 300‘ will prob-
ably be the number who failed to re-
turn to school the second semester.

Panther Ping Pong
Team Ties For
League Lead

 

Fresh from a sweeping 5-0 triumph
over the Center Y team the previous
week, the Panther ping-pong ﬁve
drove its way to a tie for the _top po-
sition of the Y league last Friday by
narrowly defeating the strong East
Liberty squad. 3-2. Downtown Y is
the other league leader.

Tonight, the group opens the sec-"

bud and ﬁnal round of the" league
schedule when it plays the Hilltop Y
team at the Y Hut.

Against East Liberty, conquerors of
Downtown Y, the only league team
that has beaten Pitt, Gene Solow,
number one man, Leonard Sherer, and
Fred Margolis scored Panther vic-
tories, the first named in straight
games. Regis Wolff, manager, and
Bob Berman were defeated.

Although the locals took all ﬁve
from the Center Y, thematches were
all cl’ose"and' ‘hard’ fought. "The fea-
ture aifair of the meet was the first
match in which Gene Solow eked out
a straight game victory over Everett
Utterback, former Pitt track captain
and intercollegiate jumping champion,
21-19, 22-20.

Frida)-"s win gives the Pitt squad a
record of four victories and one de-
feat in the ﬁrst half of the Y league
composed of teams.from,Tech, Down-
town, Center, East Liberty, and Pitt
Y’s.

Feuchtwanger Says Small
Colleges Here Are Liberal

The author of “Power," “Success,”
and “Josephus," Lion Feuchtwanger,
German novelist, says that our de-
pression is a blessing in disguise. Dr.
Feuchtwangeiywho was in Pittsburgh
on Sunday to address a. YMHA group,
declares, "Americans in the past three
years have become amazingly recep-
tive-to,new ideas.”

The man who is called by many the
greatest living German author is short
and stocky, wears the wide-brimmed
hat of a European university pro-
fessor, and speaks English with a.
deliberate enunciation,

Asked what he thought of American
university students, the German vis-
itor replied, "Of course there can be
no comparison between the_ European
and the‘ Americaiifuniversities,
type of students and their aims are
totally diﬁerent."

“But," Dr. Feuchtwanger added, "I
have found the small college in the
United States full of liberal thought.
It has shown a deﬁnite dislike for the
status quo. The larger schools have
been rather disappointing on this
score.”

. The noted author.spoke_ ironically
of universities -which built neW,,foot-
ball stadia and did not even have the

‘rue’

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
   
 
 

fourteenth edition of the. Encyclopedia
Brittanica in their libraries. \Vhen
told that Pitt's library contained the
latest edition, he smiled and shook
hands. “Congratulations,” he said
almost’ fervently.

German university students, accord-
ing to Feuchtwzlnger, are largely Nazi,
He characterized the recent antl-
Seinitic riots of the college students
as mere exuberance, the effect, of the
mob spirit.

"The youth in Germany is balanced
between Hitlerism and Communism."
Dr. Feuchtwanger asserted. "When
Hitler fails, as I believe he will, our
young men and women will join the
Communist movement."

Strongest Track Squad ii
In Five Years Competes
In West Virginia Relays

 

50 Cinder Path Artists to Take
Games Tomorrow; Varsity, Frosh Spilcers
Entered in Eighteen Events

 

Ready for a ﬁne showing in
Olson, 50 track and ﬁeld athletes

gantown to compete in the ﬁfth annual VVcst Virginia Indoor Relays.

Varsity and freshman stars wil

afternoon and evening in the spacious Mountaineer track and ﬁeld

house.

Coach -Olson will enter three
able.”
Jacobson, a trio of sophomores from
Brooklyn, N, Y., will race in the 70-
yafd event, and will compose a major
portion of Olson's teams in the three
relay affairs. Gordon Fraser, veteran
dash star of West Virginia U., will
furnish the chief opposition,

In the mile, Pitt has entered W'agen-
houser, Lawrence, and Albright, while
the half will ﬁnd Charles Kirkpatrick,
‘Watkins. and McDonald. competing.

They'wil1' have to best "Tom Ottey, ‘

Michigan State cross-country star,
and Dever and Zimmerman of West
Virginia. The two hurdle events,
both at the 70-yard distance, will ﬁnd
Fleming and Captain Glenn Thiesseu
facing the starter.

Two teams will likely be entered
in the three relays, the sprint, that at
4/5 mile, and the mile medley. Be-
sides the tracksters mentioned, Mil-
ligan, Keller, Kiger.» and DeMarche,
will compose the various teams. Last
year Pitt took second in the 4/5 mile
relay and pulled down third in the
sprint event. The medley relay is an
innovation this year.

As varsity representatives in the
field events, Ericson and O’Dell in the
pole vault, Fleming, Sebastian, and
Thiessen in the broad jump, Thiessen
and Harlow Kirkpatrick in the high
jump, and Bonavita, ‘Valenti, and
Wilkins in the shot put and 35-pound
weight throw, will make the trip.
Valenti won the shotput last year and
Kirkpatrick won fourth in the high
jump.

Freshmen have been entered in four
events. 1\icMunn, Rollins, Bixler, and
Riblett are the 70-yard entrants. Mc-
Munn, and Connelly are likely start-
ors in the 440-yard dash, and these
men, together with Good, Ba.1'num,
Scott, and Quigley, will compose two
sprint relay teams. In the freshman

low hurdles Olson will use Good,
Barnum and Blakemore.

Aquatic Squad Leaves Today on
Invasion ot F. 6- M., Del.

The varsity swimmers started out
this morning in autos to make their
second eastern invasion of the sea-
son. Two Eastern Collegiate Swim-
ming Association meets, with Frank-
lin and Marshall at Lancaster tonight
land with Delaware University at
Newark, tomorrow night, have beeni
scheduled for the trip. The team will
sleep tonight in Lancaster, but may
return .to Philadelphia following the
Delaware University meet.

Coach Pat Corr and Manager Frank’
Sessa will be in charge of a squad of
twelve swimmers including Captain
Adlersberg, Carik, Cogswell, Denny,
lJones, Lewis, Norton, Reilly, Robbins,
Schmeiler, Stinner, and Szawzuk. 

Both Franklin and Marshaland Del-’

aware provided strong opposition tori
the Pitt tankers last year. F. & ll .;
boasts of an outstanding star in
Chalmers, a. backstroker, and distance
swimmer, who was a member of the
1932 American Olympic team. Last
year Chalmers pressed Jack Hanna to
a new Trees pool mark in the 440.
His specialty, however, is the back-
stroke where Jones and Szawzuk,
just up from the freshman team will
test him. Hanna, newly returned to
school, is experiencing some difficul-
ties in having his credits certiﬁed and
probably will not compete in the
meets on the trip. ‘

Delaware is very strong in the
short sprints and its relay is expected
to repeat last year’s victory. Pitt,
however, is a better rounded squad
and should have no difficulty winning
the longer freestyle events and the
specialties.

Pitt swimmers are already familiar
with the Lancaster pool, considered
one of the best for exhibitions in the
east, as both the varsity and fresh-
man teams competed there in the in-
tercollegiutes last year.

The Stadium Ollice has gone
haywire. Everyone’s trying to
answer everyone else’s mail, no-
body will answerthe telephone,
and <an‘swers"-to» lettersthave» gone
to hang. Every day since a week
ago last Monday the Stadium
calendars have been marked with
heavy black crayon, the reason
for it all being the absence of its
generale des corps,

Now convalescing in the Pas-
savant Hospital, Patty Johnson
smiles at it all, even though she
is the cause of the upheaval.
Suffering from an attack oi’. ap-
pendicitis while at work, she was
removed to the hospital, where
she underwent an operation, Mon-
day afternoon of last week.

Since her graduation in 1929,
Patty has guided the destinies of
various.lJra.nehes:ot'.-.the office’ out-  .

‘ ﬁt, answering complaints, getting
rid of the undesirables, and giv-
ing suggestions on answering fan
mail for the boys around the of-
ﬂce. ‘

But since the ruler has tempor-
arily abdieated, the boys up at
the oﬁice are willing to call
everything quits, and keep the
hospital telephone busy inquiring
when their secretary will again
take up ‘her duties,

 

Irish Oppose
Pitt Passers

Panthers Visit - South Bend
Tomorrow Evening

   

The lights in the Stadium pavilion

will remain dark Saturday evening,
for Doctor Carlson and his Golden
Panthers take the road for a one-night
stand at South Bend. They will be
returning the compliment of the Irish
Ramblers visit at the Stadium three
weeks ago.
" If the Irish arento have their way, it
won’t be a pleasant one for the
Panthers passers, for their 39-35 de-
feat while in Pittsburgh January 21 is
one, they believe, to be avenged.

Since their meeting that Saturday
night the Carlsonites have been set-
ting a basketball pace to be wondered
at. With the exception of a. slowing
up Wednesday evening, the Panthers
ha.-ve been scoring at more than a
pc-int-a-minute rate.

Vvest Virginia was first to go the
way of most opponents. Pitt gave the
Mountaineers a longed to be remem-
bered 42-20 drubbing to win their
fourth Eastern Intercollegiate league
game the following Saturday.

Last ‘weekend proved another fruit-
ful one for the Panthers defeating
Fordham 47-16 on Friday night, and
invaded the barracks of the V‘.7est
Point cadets the following afternoon
to win their tenth game of the sea-
son, 45-25.

Tomorrow evening's game will be a
change for the Panthers. They’ve
been having a. rather easy time of it
since the last meeting of the two
teams at the Stadium. The Irish
have an nasty way of making things
tough for their Pittsburgh opponents
and tomorrow night will be no excep-
tion.

The same lineup as the Rainblers
used in Pittsburgh will confront the
Panthers at South Bend.

Voegle, Jordan, Krause,
and Crowe will oppose Smith,

Balclein
(5.

Hughes, Cribbs, Ochsenhirt, and Mc- 4

Camant. Dr. Carlson will probably
take along W. Hughes, Wanio, Bond,
Kuno, and Brooks as available substi-
tute material.

During First Halt

Panthers on In Form

Western Reserve bid fair to cop
its sixth cage victory of the season
Wednesday evening in the Stadium;
but Doctor Carlson persuaded his
boys during the half that it was no
go, so the Panthers hung another
scalp on their basketball belt, 27-22.

-' Finding itdiflicult to send the ball
through the. loop in the earlier mo-
ments of -the game,,- the score-a-minute
team of not so many evenings ago
saw the Reserve Redbirds cashing in
on their scoring opportunities. The
Panther failed to raise their scoring
ﬂag until half of the ﬁrst period had
passed.

But they had found the game of in-
and-out-of-the-basket seemingly a. good
one to play, for the ball rolled out of
the loop while the visitors were gain-
ing a_s11bstaiitia.l lead. As the half
ended the score showed the Panth'ei"'s
three ponts behind their opponents,
11-8.

The second half was a. much better
one for the Panthers. Smith, Hughes
and Wanio each scored ll. ﬁeld goal in
rapid succession as the second period
opened to put the Panthers two
points ahead at 13-11.

From then on until the end of the
game it was justa matter of. keeping
the visitors from getting too close,
which they did with :1. great deal of
ease for the Reserve ﬁve seemed
ready to admit defeat.

Skippy Hughes and Don .\ijcCa.m.ant
shared the Panther scoring honor,
each scoring six points. Berwald was
the best for the vistors, collecting the
same number of points.

O_ver1a.t“:the' ..Omég_'a .Delt. house
an argument' has some of the boys
all steamed up. It all comes out
of a bowling match Wednesday
evening.

The alumni members of the chap-
ter contested the actives’ right
to any so-called bowling cham-

""pionsl1"ip. so nothing would do but
a grudge bowling match at the
Center-Neville alleys,

The result was another argu-
ment. "VVe won,” say the actives,
“Yeah?” retort the alumni, "look
at the score." And it goes on
and on.

Taking two of the three games
rolled, the actives lay claim to
victory, but the alumni bowlers
in rolling a score of 1879 to 1850
for the actives won’t admit de-
feat. Ted Biddle with a total of

alumni, with l\«Iey'er high scorer

At Stadium Tonight

Pitt Favored to Outtight Blutt
Team and Gain Win-

I Hillmen Are ‘Strengthened

Aided by the presence of Captain
“Duke” Seigel, the Pitt boxing team
will attempt to break into the winning
side oi‘ the ledger when they meet the
Duquesno. University boxers at the
stadium‘ -pavilion tonight. .

Both Pitt and Duquesne have lost
their last match, the Dukes dropping
a close 4-3 decision to Temple, and

the Panthers taking it on the chin
from Army, 51/,3-11,-4;." The Pitt boxers
hold the edge for tonight’s match on

the basis of comparative scores, but-

as usual, this method of predicting the
winner can be discarded, Coach
Miller, of -Duquesne, has . gradually

rounded “his squad ~ into shape, «-and-

the return to school of Carl Avington,
light heavyweight boxer, has strength-
ened the Dukes considerably.

Several changes will be made in the
Pitt lineup, with Junge, and possibly
Kopp making their initial appearance
in Pitt colors. Junge will replace
Pearle in the 115-pound class, Pearle
having dropped out of school. This
will mark Junge's ﬁrst collegiate
light, and he will be matched against
“Speedy” Vitulla of Duquesne. Al-
though Junge’s height may give him
some advantage, Vitulla’s experience
will likely swing a victory to the
Dukes in this class.

the 125-pound class, and ii’ Coach

Dr. Howard C. Kidd  

- HE work which brought international recognition and an un-

timely death to Dr. Howard C. Kidd, p1'0fc.~’5sor of commerce at
the University and a noted authority on railroad economics, deprived
the University of one of its most valued faculty members.

The brilliant young professor, whose work in the ﬁeld of trans-
portation had commanded the attention of students, railroad execu-
tives and ﬁnanciers the world over, met a tragic end the a.-fternoon ,
of Saturda.y,.,Janua11'y 2-8, when he was struck by a. Pennsylvania. rail- -
road train While on an iiispection trip of the road ’s‘ Pitcairn yards.
He is believed to have been blinded by rain and snow which began
to fall shortly before he left the oﬁice of one of his. many friends,
the I’itcairn‘assistan-t tra_i‘n-master, with whomvhe h-ad been visiting. ,

Dr. Kidd’s death came as a- shock to both fa-culty members and
students of tl1e_Uni’ve«rs,i-ty. Young in years——with.in. but a few days
of his l.’orty—ﬁ’rst. blrtl.'1d~ay at the time of his death——hc already had
achieved‘ reco‘gniti'on as one of the few outstanding au'th_orities in his
ﬁeld of study-. Scarcely a week before, he had returned from a six
weeks’ trip to the Argentine, where he ha‘d‘_co‘m:pleted a study of
South American railroad problems assigned‘ him by a group of in-
ﬂuential‘ English-‘bankers. ; - .

The tragedy of Dr. Kidd "st death was heightened for many of his
University friends by the circumstances under which they first
learned of his accident and subseq-uent passi.-ng. He was to have
delivered a lecture that night to the local alumni of the School of
}5usiness A(l'Irlll1lStl.‘atl0n, assembled to hear him speak in the Hotel
Schenley-. One. by one, as the members with whom he had been
associated arrivedhthey were-, inforn1.e,d' of,his,deatl1.   _ .

The loss whiclr is felt by Dr. Kidd=’"s associates in the adminis-
tration, faculty and student body extends likewise outside the Uni-
versity. In the words of A. H. Armbruster, assistant dean of the
School of Business Admin-istration_, of which Dr. Kidd was a mem-
ber, “We have lost one of our best men and one of the most prom-
ising in the country in the ﬁeld of economics and transportation.
The University has lost a. man it will be impossible to replace.”

Call ll: What You Will

0 THOSE unfortunate b-y—s~tanders whose‘ college careers have —
never been ﬁred by the experience of‘ promoting a student dance, ,
it appears tl1at‘tl1e «show of determination and enthusiasm oifered
by the Junior Prom committee can be rivaled only by its display of
well-intentioned but, nevertl-ieless, poor judgment. '
Some students of average ﬁnancial means have had the idea for

their reach. Many of them, called upon to share with their parents
«the burden of meeting necessary expenses, have been forced to deny
themselves’ either partially or en‘t'irely the participation in social

my education?”

Many of these students, frankly, are worried a little about that
note for the semester’s tuition, are wondering just where the money
is coming from for textbooks. Conseqguen-tly, if they are planning
any expenditures for social pleasure, these average students must
pass up this ycar"s “-bigger and better” dance, be it the Junior Prom
or the Associated llrlugwump Clubs’ Social.

Add to these conditions aﬁecting the individual the additional
handicap of an over-crowded social program~,wit'h a half-dozen so-

somewhat remote. And the remoteness of this hoped-for success is
evidenced in the records of the past scmester’s failures.

The News urged a‘ drastic slashing of expenditures for the Ju-‘
nior Prom because it honestly believes that the student body, under
the existing conditions, cannot support the present program. As a
means of carrying out that reduction, the News reeonnnendcd the
scheduling of a local orchestra by the committee. Our wish was not

are concerned in safeguarding the interests of the student body, in
having the Prom and all other social aﬁairs well-rounded successes.
Regardless of what measure of ﬁnancial success is achieved by
the Junior Prom, some level-headed, unbiased" thought and study
should be given the structure of the University social program.

iBusz°ness 13 Flat On

Its Back, Says
Review Editor

Pittsburgh business is ﬂat on its
back, is as much alive as the
statuary posed in front of Memo-
rial Hall, if you want another
simile, is almost as ﬂat as the
proverbial deflated pancake.

Although the annual number of
the Pittsburgh Business Review,
edited by Bervard Nichols-of the
Business Research Bureau, does
not paint the contemporary eco-
nomic picture as, bad as this, it
does not predict any ﬂitting dam-
sel‘ labeled “prosperity” tripping
on the business horizon.

In fact it says-. business_ at the
beginning of the year of grace
1933 is as rheumatic as that of
the same time twelve months ago.
Besides, the Pittsburgh steel in-_
dustry, which has always been,
the trainer and pace-setter for
industry the (iount-ry over, the
Review says, had its poorest year
since the late nineties. when the
gay blades and lithesome ladies
left, economic worries in the dust,
of a rakish tandem. Too, unem-
ployment incrcased slightly and
building "took another slide.-, Fi-
nancial conditions remained about
the same. However, industries
producing consumption goods,
shoes, flour, textiles, etc., held up
fairly well.

But don’t let this discourage
you; if you haven’t become “de-
pression-accli-mated by this time,
you never will!

The Minneapolis Symphony Orches-

to Pittsburghers. The orchestra will
not only give its regular evening con-
cert tonight, but will supplement this
with an interesting matinee program
tomorrow afternoon,

‘This  arrangement " relieves the
crowded feeling from two concerts in
a day, such as the Detroit Orchestra
was forced to give, and allows us a
little more leisure in our enjoyment.»
An Afternoon in Vienna is the name
Mr; Ormandy has given the program,
for it is devoted entirely to Viennese
music.

Brahms, Russians Included

The most ambitious number and
certainly the finest of the evening
concert is the Brahms Second Sym-
phony. Brahms wrol;e this work
when he was already far along in
his career and mature in his musical
development. His First Symphony
had been many years in the making,
the composer treading slowly, yet
steadily "and securely, in the path of
the great Beethoven. He wished to

tition with his predecessor. But once
the first work .was. off his pen,
Brahms turned at once with swift,
lyric stride into this Second Sym-
phony. Here he‘ comniands the me-
dium perfectly and gives himself en-
tirely to a rejoicing in his powers," to
the glorious music of life, and to na-
ture in her peaceful, constant loveli-
ness. The effect is like a pastoral

-the
"Alumni Hall.

The recurring theme is suggestive of
a bird-song. The whole work, indeed,
has a. song—like appeal, and draws
close to Beethoven's Sixth and to
Schubert.

The second half of the program in-
cludes several of the modern Russian
composers. Portions of Stravinsky’s
Firebird are being given as well as a
ﬁne Rimsky-Korsakoff number in the
composer’s most characteristic vein.

The Saturday matinee is a program
for everyone. Calling it An Afternoon
in Vienna just about hit it right, for
what is more purely Viennese than
the music-of Johann Strauss? Several
of his waltzes as well as a number of
dances and other. compositions are
scheduled. It ought to make a ﬁne
hour or two of enjoyment. The con-
cert is to be held in Carnegie Hall,
where student rates will be available.

Fine Screen. Offering

Perhaps one could ﬁnd time and
money also over- the‘ week-end for
Noel" Cowardis motion picture produc-
tion, Cavalcade. If not. it is comfort-
ing to know that the show is being
held“ over‘ anotl1er.six,g days. ..Beyo~nd
doubt, Cavalcade is oneof the finest
things yet turned on the screen. Most
of us know Coward’ only through his
brilliant comedies, Private Lives and
Design For Living, but this is another

,s.ide—-—deep_cr', intensely serious, and

with a scope which», despite its vast-
is completely satisfying. The
story is the life of at woman——a sym-
bolic woman, afsoul roundingitself in
rhythm to full

proportion. In this respect, its Eng-

lish setting does not keep it home

but reaches out a hand to everyone.
One can scarcely hope. to see any-
thing better this year.

The stage is all set for target practice. The magician

lifts his bow and aims an arrow at the bull’s-eye. His
lovely assistant then steps in front of the target and
he shoots the arrow—-apparently I/lraug/z her--and it
- ﬁxes -itself in-the very center-of the-bull’-s-eye! And
she smiles through it all while the audience gasps.

EXPLANATION:

The arrow which the xnarlraman “shoots through” his
assistanth silrinply folds upbitétdo the crossbow! The
arrow w ic is actually em e ed in the target is shot
by the girl herself from a belt concealed under her
dress. She releases a little spring, the arrow unfolds,
and shoots straight into the bull’s-eye! It is all done in
a flash! So quickly the eye cannot detect the girl’s
movements! To heighten the impression that the ar-
row has gone right through, the girl releases :1 ribbon
from the front of her dress—the continuation, appar-
ently, of the ribbon attaclm-d.to.the arrow in the target.
