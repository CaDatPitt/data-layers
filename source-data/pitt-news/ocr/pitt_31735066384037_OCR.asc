Pitt, Gators Wrestle l 7-l 7 Tie

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer
GAINESVILLE, Fla.—Ber_j
Yepremain’s 28-yard ﬁeld goal,,
with only 1:26 remaining, turned
two seemingly harmless defense--
oriented Florida touchdowns into a
17-17 tie with the Panthers.

In fact, the Gator kicking game
kept Pitt in poor shape the entire
ﬁrst half, preventing the Panthers
from initiating an offensive attack
past their own 21-yard line.

“It was one of the ﬁnest college
football games people around here
have ever seen,” Pitt head coach

University Borrowing
To Meet Expenses

By MARK MURPHY
Pitt News Staff Writer

The event considered inconceiv-
able in July and unlikely in early
September became reality only six
weeks into the school year, as Pitt
began borrowing money last week
to meet its October operational
expenses.

Pitt was forced to borrow the
money——up to $5 million by the end
of the month——— due to the State
Legislature’s inability to determine

how to finance $300 million dollars‘

in non-preferred appropriations.
Pitt is scheduled to receive $61.7
million

Because of the Legislature’s
delay. Pitt is losing an estimated
$4.000 per day. The daily losses
comprise $3,000 in lost "interest on
the $5 million per month Pitt
normally receives from Harrisburg,

Pitt Staff Salaries Upgraded

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

A staff pay and classiﬁcation
program adopted Oct. 1 sets new
starting salaries ‘for non-faculty
iiversity staff- members. The
‘nthly range from $475 to $1,475,
making Pitt staff salaries equal to

the national university average.
The program since has been
subject to widespread misinterpre-
tation in the University because

‘information concerning seniority

rights has not been released by

-Pitt’s personnel department.

According to Ann‘ Hill, admini-
strative aid to Pitt's economics
department, the only people fully
aware of the new program’s
provisions are those who attended

a meeting last Firday, when an
announcement regarding provis-
ions was made.

“The department chairmen have

‘ not yet received the information on

pay scales from personnel,” Hill
said Thursday. “The way
personnel has so far explained the
program is that throughout the
University, people coming in will
be making the same as or 'more
than people with seniority.”
According to a secretary emp-
loyed by the University for more
than four years, employees cur-
rently making less than the
minimum salary will have their
wages raised to the new level after
the traditional three-month probat-
ion period. New employees will

receive a raise that will give them a
larger salary than those with
seniority.

“Our main objection is that it's a
slap in the face to seniority,” the
secretary said.

According to Nancy Gilkes,
co-director of personnel, the rights
of those with seniority will be
protected.

._"‘From now on. probationary
increases will be strictly monitored
and very few, if any, will be
approved." Gilkes said. “We
would be holding the line, so a new
person would not be making more
than someone with seniority. We
anticipated that problem (misinter-
pretation) and we will not let those
kind of things happen.”

in addition to $1,000 in interest on
the new loans.

Although the University faces a
crisis if the needed money does not
arrive soon, Pitt’s ﬁnancial situa-
tion apparently is much better than
that of Penn State and Temple
Univetsities. Both of these schools
have been borrowing for weeks.
Reportedly. Penn State already has
borrowed $27 million, with dialy
interest payments of $3,000.
Temple reportedly has borrowed
$17.4 million, and is paying $4,400
daily for the money. Temple has

estimated it will incur debts of $48

million if the Legislature withholds
the appropriated funds until the
end of the year.

The State Legislature will recon-
vene tommorrow when another
attempt may be made to resolve
the ﬁscal dilemma.

Jackie Sherrill said. “Florida has
an exciting football team with lots of
talent.”

And lots of fans. The 62,724
capacity crowd screamed relent-
lessly and were overwhelming.

“We’ve faced a lot of that,”
Panther starting quarterback Matt

Cavanaugh, cast and all, said after ‘

the contest. “Other schools have
fans who are just as tough. It’s not
really a‘ big factor.”

The big factor was fumbles:
Florida lost four of them, Pitt
six—including a Cavanaugh bobble
which set up the Gators’ ﬁrst score
of the evening.

After a standoff ﬁrst quarter in
which the Panther defense stopped
three Gator scoring drives, Cava-
naugh fumbled the ball on the
Panther 14-yard line after an
apparent ﬁrst down. Defensive end
Richard Ruth pounced on the ball in
the end zone to give Florida a 7-0
lead.

But the Gators gave the tally
back, as Bill Neill, injured Dave
Logan‘s replacement, recovered
second-string quarterback John
Brantl.ey’s miscue on the Florida
34-yard line. Six plays later,
Cavanaugh bolted over me goal line
from eight yards out to knot the
match, 7-7, at halftime. The

Pitt News Staff Writer.

Judy Elliott lost $150 Sept. 16 because she was nice to a
stranger.

While walking to a Point Park dance class, Elliott, 18', was
approached by two middle-aged men in front of the Wood
Street Pittsburgh National Bank (PNB) downtown.

One man told Elliott his partner had recently arrived from
Africa, could not speak much English and needed a place to
stay. Both men seemed confused and lost. They asked
Elliott to go with them to Arthur Treacher’s, a local fast food
restaurant.

Elliott, who had free time before her 4 p.m. class, decided
to help the men. At Arthur Treacher’s, they sat down and or-
dered coffee. In the course of conversation, the African man
repeatedly pulled a large wad of money, allegedly $2,000
from his pocket.

Elliot asked him why he didn’t deposit the money. He told
her American banks could not be trusted. When she ex-
plained the dependability of the American banking system,
the African asked her to prove it to him.

Elliot then went to PNB, withdrew $150, and returned to
Arthur Treacher’s to show the money to the men.

After talking a short while longer, the men decided to
deposit their money. By that time, however, the banks had
closed for the day, so the men agreed to meet Elliott early the
next morning and deposit the money. The African removed a
handkerchief from his pocket and placed money and Elliott’s
together. He allowed her to tie the knot, and gave her the
bundle.

The men walked Elliott to her class, and she put the bundle
in her locker.

That evening, Elliott-told her motherlabout her unusual en-
counter. Her mother immediately took Elliot to Point Park.
When they to the locker and opened the bundle, the money
was gone.

A week later, a Pitt freshman and triend ot l;Iliott's, 15-
year-old Beverly Jeter, was approached by a man in the
Oakland Mellon Bank. He told her he_recently had arrived
from Africa, couldn't speak much English and needed help
finding the Caldwell Real Estate Building. When Jeter and the
man walked outside, another man approached them, asking if
they needed help. Jeter, remembering her friend's encoun-
ter, immediately became suspicious and left the men.

“ 72 Years of«.CoIIegiat’e Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Forget It, We Fear

Director of Student Activities Willard Heaps has a good idea: he
wants to renovate the Student Union, one of the University’s most-
used buildings but one that is in poor repair.

That a problem exists is not questioned. Several student
organizations have lost offices recently because of the Union’s
space shortage. The building looks as bad as Pitt’s current finan-
cial books. And students continue to use the building often and in
large numbers.

The solution, of course, is to repair the Union, which was the
Schenley Hotel before Oakland c0uldn’t support a fine hotel. The
need for this project has been understood—and pursued——by many
persons in the past 15 years. Each time, after well-displayed news
stories and hopeful editorials, we have seen the idea postponed.

Although Heaps and his staff will do their best, we can see no

reason to become hopeful again. Money is tight at Pitt, and
students—despite protests from the Cathedral——are not that high
on Pitt’s list of priorities.
, This is not to say we would not like to see these necessary
renovations completed; we would. And we believe those
renovations should be begun as soon as possible—they are much
more important than several construction projects recently under-
taken at Pitt.

But while we’d like to see Heaps’s recycled dream come true,
we’re not confident we will. In the end, we fear, Pitt again will
make a mistake by not paying for it.

Left for Dead

Well-directed hopes were brought to life with the recent word
that a new student affairs office would be concerned, at’ least par-
tially, with the plight of Pitt’s commuters. That group, often left
for dead, has been without an effective advocate for too long.

But then came the announcement by Jack Hayes, director of the
Office of Special Student Services, that his staff would not perform
“direct-line” services to commuters. And then went most of the
hopes.

Administrators in the student-services area have been hit with
budget cuts that have forced them to seek ways of providing
“more” service with less money. As is the case with most such
methods, it hasn’t worked.

Forming a new office responsible for designing grand new ways
of serving students is a great idea, unless there is no way to im-
plement those programs. Such an ability currently does not exist at
Pitt when commuters are concerned, so the new office should be
more concerned with providing tangible services than with drawing
up theoretical blueprints that never will be used.

Clean Registration

affects the student body while
leaving university buildings in-
tact.”

According to data released by
the Center for Arms Control, not
only will every student within 10
miles be registered instantly but
every student within 25 miles will be
registered by the end of the week.

Registration symptoms will crop up

The Office of the Provost joined
with the University’s Center for
_Arms Control today to announce
the creation of a device that will
revolutionize the concept of class
registration.

According to assistant to the
provost Walt Meyrz, the device,
actually a low-yield explosive will
effectively and totally register every
student within a 10-mile radius a
few hours after it is dropped on
campus.

“The bonus of this neutron-reg-
istrar, as we prefer .to call
it,” Meyrz said, “is that it.

from area to area within a 75-mile
radius, depending on terrain and
weather conditions.

Dissent and opposition to the
neutron registrar already has been
voiced on campus.

“The holocast that used to be
posed by all-out registration is
eliminated by this so-called ‘clean’
registration,” said Tom Vorestee.

Letters to the Editor

Students Finest Hour Smashed

This letter is in response to the
articles by Dan McKay concerning
the protest at Kent State (Pitt News
-Sept. 26 and 28). It is truly sad
that the students gathered there for
this demonstration are represent-
ing all the students.

So this is what the student
movement has come to? A truly
open-minded organization of stu-
dents. calling themselves the
Revolutionary Student Brigade.
whose unbiased view of the
situation we were treated to in
these articles.
the TSB explains: “Why are they
trying to smash the spotlight on the
decade when the student move-
ment saw its finest hour?" YQS.
riots. violence. hatred,._... and

.death. Quite a finest hour.

And just why is this finest hour
being smashed? “The reason
is...because the nature of the
enemy is the same." What

romised

chairman of the Pacifists for the
Limitation of Strategic Registration
(PLOSR). “The havoc caused by
limited registration on the ground
ﬂoor and ninth ﬂoor of the
Cathedral was enough to prevent
the administration from attempting
full-scale registration . ’ ’

“The humanitarian aspect of this
should be considered,”Vorestee
continued, pounding his fist upon
thesolid oak lecturn. “Is it correct
for Pitt to register every student,
child, 50-year-old steel worker and
nursing mother within a l0-mile
radius? College and registration is
not for everybody.Can you imagine
a 44-year-old rooﬁng and insulation
repairman standing in Panther
Stadium chanting,“Pitt is it?”

A dissenter in the faculty senate
was Marshall Rockwell. who
supported a more sophisticated
version of the present registration
system rather that a complete
switch to the neutron registrar.
Roclwell proposed upgrading the
current P52.registration ﬂeet to the
modern Pl propaganda droppers.
Shells containing Course Election
Record forms would be dropped all
over campus in an attempt to
convince students to register.

Rockwell’s plan was scrapped as
too costly. It also was a campaign
promise of a senate president not to
authorize any contracts for the

production of P1’s.
The last pocket of dissent was

from neighboring universities
fearing a loss of enrollment. They

enemies? Segregation. court
rulings against racial equality.
apartheid supporters. and any
warmonger. “Call them what you
want. but most of all call them the
enemy.”

All right! What’s next? More
riots? More senseless violence and
hatred? More needless bloodshed?
You bet! There's an enemy under
every rock, behind e_very. bush,
lurking just around every corner.
We students must challenge them.
We students must stand up to
them. “The people will never be
defeated!"

But. is this really what the
people want? Or do we get
misrepresented by a group “of
single minded “Representatives”
whose views are as narrow as they
claim the enemies views are?

“Call them what you want. but
most of all call them the enemy!"

assailed Pitt’s stand on student
rights and condemned the neutron
registrar as an example of Pitt
hypocricy.

However their complaints have
not been heard since it was
revealed. These universities had
successfully tested a satellite-kill-
ing death-ray registrar.

According to the Center for Arms
Control.Pitt plans to continue
registration this winter with its
old P52 fleet. No more work will be
done on the neutron registrar until
the United Nations Committee

Bellefield F ratemities Boast Many Benefits  

By DAVEMC DONALD

Pitt News Staff Writer

For this week’s tour of frater-
nities, I didn’t have a long trek; I

explored the Bellefield Street,

fraternities.

The frats on Belleﬁeld Street are
only a six- or seven-minute walk
from the Cathedral, yet are
removed from the University
because they are in a residential
setting, with either the School for
the Blind or Schenley High School
across the street. b

On the right side of Belleﬁeld sits
a large house with a Delta Phi sign,
looking like a Swiss Chalet. All
similarity ends there. When you get
inside, you know you're not in
Europe but in a typically abused Pitt
fraternity house.

Delta Phi is being renovated; a
new combination stereo-TV and

A ‘trophy room is being built on the

second ﬂoor. Beside the new

tentertainment room is a large,
well-equipped kitchen, used by only
a few Delta Phi members.

In the basement of the house are a
medium-sized dancer ﬂoor and a
separate barroom. Also in the
basement are a washer and dryer, a
nice convenience that I’m sure gets
a good workout from the 25
fraternity members.

On the first floor is another small
living room, along with agood-sized
poolroom.

Mark Schwartz, president of
Delta Phi, sees his fraternity as a
growing Pitt chapter.

‘ ‘We’re kind of small now, but we
have 15 pledges now and it looks
like a good group coming in,”
Schwartz said.

The main selling points of his
fraternity, according to Schwartz,
are its tight bond of brotherhood
and the leadership quality of its
members.

“Since our beginning in 1969, we
have had six Interfraternity Council
(IFC) board members, including the
current IFC president and last
year's IFC man of the year,”
Schwartz added.

The room fee for Delta Phi is $70 a

' month, the pledge fee is $135 and

dues and parlor fees are $105 a
term.
Next door to Delta Phi is Pi Kappa
Alpha. Pika seems like a ﬂashback
to the fraternity days of the early
1960's. They come off this way, not
because they jam telephone booths
or swallow goldﬁsh,‘but because the
brothers are together a lot and they
appear to be one crazy family.

Dave Donovan, Pi Kappa Alpha’s
president and vice president of the
IFC, gave other examples of why his
fraternity appears to be a good
old-fashioned fraternity.

“We really do feel like brothers
here,” Donovan said. “We’re all
working toward the same goals, we

eat together in the cafeteria, we
watch TV together, we party
together. We’re very close.’.’

Although Pi Kappa Alpha retains
the tradition of a Dreamgirl Formal
and a Parents’ weekend, Donovan
said he. sees changes in his
fraternity and the entire Greek
system.

“Greeks have matured toward
each other,” Donovan said. “You
don’t see us ﬁghting with Delta Phi
or any other fraternity any more.
Economically, it just doesn’t make
sense to be wrecking each other’s
houses. We evenhave parties with
Delta Phi now.”

Pi Kappa Alpha, mostly juniors,
currently has 49 active members; 22
of them are crowded into the house.
They even have bedrooms in the
basement, right off of the party
room.

“The only bad thing is that it
makes it hard to sleep at night when
we have parties,” Donovan
explained.

Also in the basement are a new
bar and a soon-to-be-renovated
dance and party room.

The highlights of the ﬁrst floor ii

are a living room (kept mainly for
formal occasions) and a TV room.
On the second ﬂoor of the house is a
large kitchen, where four or ﬁve
members do all their cooking, and a
medium-sized room that can be
used as a dining room.

In the back of the Pi Kappa Alpha

Actress and activist Jane Fonda will speak of her acting and political careers

here next week.

house is a basketball court, often
the scene of some mean games,
according to Donovan. The
backyard is part of a training ground
for intramurals, in which Pika
members are very involved. They
battled it out for the softball
chamoionshion this past weekend.

Pika’s fees are average for ‘Pitt
fraternities. Room fees are $70 a
month, dues are $15‘ a month and
the pledge fee is $20.

Walking further up Belleﬁeld,
you can’t miss the two white marble
lions in front of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon. ‘ SAE has ﬁve characteris-
tics: its members are the most
important thing, it has the largest
amount of chapters in the country; it

is mainly a social fraternity; ‘its a '

members play intramurals, for the

p fun of it; it has a nice house.

SAE has a large downstairs, with
Old “'°°d Paneling throughout. It
has a large dance ﬂoor and meeting
room, with an amusement arcade-
type soccer game and a big barroom
with many taps.

The ‘kitchen, which most mem-

bers make use of, is nothing great,

but the rest of the ﬁrst floor has a lot
of charm.

To the right. as you enter the
house, is a TV room equipped with
suitable furniture. Across from the
TV room is the “Green Room,"
which contains SAE trophys, a
piano and a small library. Topping
off the first floor is a great-looking
poolroom, with wooden paneling
similar to that in the Cathedral‘s
Nationality Rooms. Most ofthe first
ﬂoor walls are ﬁnished in the same

way.

As for intramurals, SAE isn’t one
of the biggies, but they don’t try to

Polished Rush  
Losing Old Image

‘By GARY GRAFF
Rush -
A Farewell To Kings

After ﬁve albums of pounding
heavy metal, Rush has released
what is probably its ﬁnest work, ‘ ‘A
Farewell to Kings.”

The title is symbolic. Rush
expands from the bass-guitar-
drums sound that was the Canadian
trio’s trademark. After ﬁve years of
comparison to Led Zeppelin, Black
Sabbath and other heavy metal
kings, Rush bid this image farewell.

Rush’ s music, for years termed as
“English space rock without
keyboards,” has become tighter
and polished on “A Farewell to
Kings.’ ’ The keyboardless image is
shed, as bassist-vocalist Geddy Lee
adds a mini-mood synthesizer to the
bass-guitar-drums triumvirate.

The title track begins the album.

It opens with Alex Lifeson’s
acoustic guitar and the first strains
of synthesizer; then, the electric
instruments take over. Lifeson
plays at his best since “Fly by
Night.”

“A Farewet1,.to Kings” is the
smoothest number on the album.
Lee's voice has changed from a
high-pitched scream to a mature,
88Htl‘8ll'étl ttiliﬁ: I:lf‘Es8ﬁ’s sale is
tighter and more polished than most
of his previous work.

Drummer Neil Peart’s lyrics have
turned toward romanticism from
the science fiction-Ayn A Rand
philosophy that dominated the first
four Rush albums.

“Xanadu,” the second song,
could hardly have been an overture
for “Citizen Kane” however, it is

the best offering on the album and
perhaps the best song Rush has
done. _ ,
Synthesizer and bells play the
dominant role in “Xanadu,” the
only drawback is that the song could
never be performed adequately
live. Rush takes full advantage of
the studio and has recorded a
masterpiece.

Side two opens with “Closer to
the Heart,” a possible single.
Lifeson alternates acoustic and

electric guitars, doing in three.

minutes what other guitarists have
trouble doing in 10.

i In “Cinderella 'Man,’,’
becomes a storyteller. The vocalist
has learned to convey the moods of a
song, and in “Xanadu” and
“Cinderella Man,” Lee works
effortlessly through the songs’
changing moods.

“Madrigal,” the slow acoustic
number, is the low point of the
album. The song is almost as boring
as “Rivendell” from “Fly by
Night,” but fortunately is not as
long.

“Cygnus X-1,” which closes the
album, is a return to science fiction
themes. The story, which according
to the cover will be continued,
follows the travel of a spacecraft to a
black hole in outer space. It ends
as the craft is sucked in. The next
album presumably will follow the
spacecraftfs adventures inside the
hole. .

The loose concept of kings and
conquerings make “A Farewell to
Kings” Rush’s best accomplish-
ment to date. The music is varied,
and the overall tone of the album is
softer and smoother, which makes
for easier listening.

If Rush can continue to produce
recordings of this nature, it will cam
its rightful spot in the music world.
For those familiar with earlier Rush
albums, a more mature, smoother
and tighter band awaits.

Previn’s Music Varied

By LYNNE L. MEYERS

Friday night’s Pittsburgh Sym-
phony concert contrasted new and
old, both in works and in
performers. A new ﬂute concerto
by British composer Sir Lennox
Berkeley was played by Bernard
Goldbverg, for 30 years the
symphony’s principal flutist.

The perennially popular
Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto was
performed by Mark Kaplan, a
brilliant young soloist giving his
Pittsburgh debut performance.
Andre Previn ended the concert on a
traditional note with the Mendels-
sohn Symphony No. 4, subtitled
“Ita1ian.”

This concert marked the first time
a Lennox Berkeley work was heard
in Pittsburgh, and reflected
Previn’s fondness for British music.

The Berkeley Flute Concerto is a
sparkling showpiece for the flutist.
but has little interest for the
orchestra.

Occasional counter themes to the
flute’s runs and trills were provided
by the clarinet and oboe; otherwise,
the chamber orchestral accompani-
ment consisted of plucked string
chords and dull, soft timpani
strokes. Bernard Goldberg’s
performance was smooth and
virtuosic. -

The reading of Tchaikovsky_’s
Violin Concerto, on the other hand,
was percussive and intense. Mark
Kaplan, winner of the coveted
Leventritt Award and a public
concert performer since the age of
17, was both powerful and subtle.
His playing was poised and mature
for one in his mid-20’s, and was
marked continually by sudden
hesitations in the middle of running
passages.

Breaking up technical passages‘
with nuances and slow-downs was
typical of violin playing of the 1920’ s
and 1930's, but is unusual today.
This older style makes the artist
sound intense without the

‘ acrobatics and cheap showmanship

Morrison ’s Letdown N ocel

By ARTHUR EVEN CHIK

“Song of Solomon”
By Toni Morrison
Alfred A. Knopf

Toni Morrison long has been
acclaimed as one of the country’s
finest novelists. In her two previous
books, she displayed an uncanny
ear for dialogue and precise
description. The best of her
characters have a way of growing
beyond the conﬁnes of her pages.

These are not meager gifts, and it
would be unfair to suggest they are
not evident in Morrison’s latest
work, “Song of Solomin. ”
Unfortunately, they are not evident
enough. Morrison’s greatest
writing strengths sink from view at
points in this novel, and the result is
a disappointing failure of potential.

That potential lies mainly in the
book's theme. The study of a man
caught in the tension between
freedom and responsibility. “Song
of Solomon” is a dense weave of
legend, life and symbol. Morrison
knows how to spin an allegory and

make it work, and she can catch the
essence of a situation and
effortlessly bend it to her purposes.

Although Morrison occasionally
gets carried away with her own
symbolism (the second time a white
peacock ﬂies into the narrative we
have a right to get suspicious), her
symbols are so powerful, and the
controllings metaphoris is so apt
the symbols could form the basis of
a splendid work of ﬁction.

But the true success of a novel
ultimately must lie in the details of
craft. In dealing with the scope of
her theme, Morrison allows these
details to slide out of her control.

The effective expression of ideas
is hampered by dislocations in plot
(particularly the failure to make the
passage of time believable), an
excess of explanation and pages of
dialogue as mechanically preachy
as a street corner propaganda
sheet.

The latter flaw is particularly
disconcerting, for in her best
moments Morrison is capable of a
great deal more. She has a special

affection for human speech and a
respect for the ingenuity of its
speakers. When a writer skilled in
poetry stoops to artiﬁcial polemics,
one can only be dismayed.

These weaknesses in technique
are nearly fatal to even the
strongest. characters in “Song of
Solomon”——-vital, imaginatively
drawn, offbeat personalities whose
lives are never quite brought into
motion. The details of their
existence are tacked haphazardly
onto the narrative, awkwardly
pulled in and out of focus and

. sometimes discarded completely.

These are failures of execution
rather than ability—too many
moments of insight and power are
scattered throughout the novel to
deny that. There would be no point
in even considering the flaws of
“Song of Solomon” if it did not
contain the raw material for a far
better book.

‘If Toni Morrison can overcome
these flaws in future work. she is
bound to become one of the most
powerful voices in modern
American fiction.

mances of the Tchaikovsky Con-
certo.

As brilliant as Kaplan was, the
orchestra was more striking. Every
timpani entrance was startlingly
loud, the strings were beguilingly
full and the staccato brass passages
were clear and incisive. The most
surprising moment of Previn’s
interpretation was the gradual
acceleration in tempo immediately
before the ﬁrst-movement violin

cadenza. _ _ _
This accelerando (as it is called in

Italian) started gradually. Within
the context of the piece, however, it
happened suddenly. Only the
timpanist reacted immediately;
other orchestra members caught up
with Previn two bars later. Previn
has been working with this type of
tempo change since he took over the
symphony last year.

.When perfected, this accelerando
will sound like the one used by the
Soviet conductor Kiril Kondrashin,
who will guest-conduct the sym-

phony sometime next year. It
seems Previn is priming symphony
members for Kondrashin’s visit.
Before the second half of the
program, there was some pomp and
circumstance. John Heinz II
presented symphony financial
director John Angle with a silver

baton, in gratitude for Angle’i‘s-Kali

service to the symphony.

When presented with this gift,
Angle quipped: “My lifelong
ambition is to use this baton to
conduct the Pittsburgh Symphony
in “Stars and Stripes Forever.”

The Mendelssohn Symphony No.
4, like the Tchaikovsky, was played
with intensity and gusto. The
's't'accatos were cleanly played, the
strings were lush, and the last
phrase of the piece skidded to an
end with an accelerando. This time,
the orchestra instantly received
Previn’s message, and raced to the
ﬁnish line together. Previn’s

orchestra is becoming more Russian ‘
by the week.

‘Almighty’

Becomes

New Movie Comedy

' By THERESA RAIMOND

A ﬁshing cap. overalls and blue
tennis shoes make a strikingly odd
God. George Burns portrays this
ludicrous Almighty in the new
movie “Oh, God.” '

Burns seeks a- messenger to
carry the ‘faith. He chooses an

ordinary man with no religious-

background and an innocent
“Dutch-boy” face———.Iohn Denver.

In a series of unusual meeting
places. such as Denver's bathroom,
his car. a grocery store and the 27th
ﬂoor of a 17-ﬂoor building, God and
messenger plot to publicize the
teachings of the Lord.

Together, they try to spread the
inspiring words. “it can work."
through the local newspaper. the
television news and the “Dinal
Shore Show."

As a result. the equilibrium of
Denver's life is shaken. His
children and wife are ridiculed. his
home becomes the target of
Snooping reporters and pestering
l‘€tl)igious freaks. and he loses his
J0 , .

The public looks upon the

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ' . . a ‘ . . . ' . . . .

messenger as a lunatic, and Denver
ends up in court for slandering a
Billy Graham ﬁgure.

_ .

The plot of “Oh, God,” is
childlike but entertaining and the
lines are clever. Both Burns and
Denver give more than adequate
performances. Burns is cool and
conﬁdent. and Denver’s confused
and naive.

Due to the movie's PG rating,
even children can enjoy this
religious satire. The humor is
honest but not blasphemous.

“Oh. God.” is similar to the pig,‘ A" ‘L-

‘Steambath.” Both works give an
absurd interpretation of God. and
both request viewers to question
the God they know.

Through the use of humor. “Oh.
God." evokes many unanswered
theological questions. Not every-
one will leave the movie pondering
some theological argument. but the
movie entertains. if it does not
arouse the intellect.

Offering a fresh perspective oi.

God and His essence. “Oh. God."u

is for both the seeker of
entertainment and the seeker of
enlightenment.

two-quarter tie necessitated some
changes.

> "We had to come back inside."
Sherrill stated. “We really didn't
do well outside—they really bottled
‘up our option plays."

The change seemed to work as,
Fred Jacobs, held to 20 yards at
halftime, exploded for 95 yards in
the second half. Elliot Walker, in
his usual good performance, gained
92 yards on the day including 50 in
the last two stanzas.

The third quarter was a collage of
fumbles, with each team losing two.
Florida's mistake thwarted Gator
momentum on the Pitt six-yard line
but the Florida fumble led to a
Panther touchdown.

Defensive back Bob _Jury’s
recovery was cashed in for seven
points by Jo Jo Heath, whose
34-yard halfback-option pass found
Willie Taylor in the‘ end zone,
capping a 94-yard, 13-play march
and giving Pitt a 14-7 advantage.

It was short-lived, however.
Only 2:14 into the fourth quarter,
Tom Aydt rushed Panther punter
Joe Gasparovic and blocked the
attempted kick at the Pitt 48-yard
line. The ball rolled backwards into

the end zone, where Chuck Hatch
dropped on it for another defense
oriented touchdown to tie the
contest at l4-l4.

But Pitt, rolling up offensive
yardage, took the lead again--for
good, it seemed--when, with only
5:56 left in the game, Mark
Schubert hit a 27-yard field goal to
seemingly hand the Panthers a
l7-l4 victory.

Florida, however, came back;
Yepremian kicked his ﬁeld goal late
in the match to cap the Gators’ only
legitimate drive of the game.

“We make too many mistakes.”
Sherrill said afterward.‘ “It was the
ﬁrst time Matt has been back since
the Notre Dame game. He did a
good job, though. There isn't a
football team in the country who
could have done as well with
conditions like that."

Cavanaugh passed well, although
the statistics wouldn't prove it.
He completed only eight of 19
passes for l60 yards- not exactly
the same Cavanaugh who ‘miffed
the Fighting Irish in the first half of
Pitt’s first game.

“The case wasn't a hinderance.
Cavanaugh said. “It was just bad

gift Finds Fumble Fever
An Offensive Drawback

Maybe the pollsters have been right all along.

After the Panthers devastated their last two opponents, Pitt
fans were beginning to wonder what their team had to do to
become one of the nation’s Top Ten teams. High point totals
traditionally have been a prerequisite for a team hoping to climb
college football’s ladder of success, and in its past two games Pitt
has responded to the challenge. But despite the Panthers’ 76-0

thrashing of Temple and an equally impressive 45-7 victory over
Boston College, both without the services of their first-string quar-
terback, the Associated Press and United Press International failed
to admit Pitt deserved a Top Ten spot.

Maybe now, after viewing Saturday’s circus in Florida, Panther
fans can understand the pollster’s point of view. There is one
major deficiency in Pitt’s offensive attack—the ability to hold on

‘@he football.

It is impossible for a team to win continually if it insistsﬂon han-
ding the ball (and, inevitably, points) over to the opposition.

It all began, as everyone knows, in the opener against Notre
Dame. Pitt was in the process of blowing the Irish off the field
when Matt Cavanaugh was befelled by injury and things began to
falter. Five lost fumbles (eight fumbles inall) consequently preven-
ted the Panthers from upsetting the preseason’s top-ranked team,
which in turn would probably have resulted in a number-one
ranking for Pitt. Everyone, including a national television audien-

ce, would agree that the better team lost the Sept. 10 contest, but
(Continued on Page 22)

Pitt News Staff Writer

J. C. Wilson lay crumpled on the
artiﬁcial turf, his body motionless.
Teammates rushed to him.
Trainers ran to him. Whispers were
heard among the crowd gathered
for the Pitt-Temple game some-
thing had to be seriously wrong with
Pitt’s ﬁne defensive right corner-
back lying lifeless on the soggy turf.

But no. Other than a little
grogginess there wasn’t anything
wrong with the Panthers’ lithe
defensive back after his mind-blow-
in g tackle of the Temple ball carrier.

In fact, Wilson resumed his
duties in the Panthers’ defensive
backﬁeld several plays later(he was
injured on the opening kick-off) and
continued to play for the remainder
of the game, as the Panthers pasted
Temple, 76-0, at Veterans Stadium
in Philadelphia several weeks ago.

“I got hit in the neck,” Wilson
explained when asked about the
incident.“I couldn‘t breathe for a
while. I just couldn’t get any air for
a few minutes.”

Wilson said he wasn’t knocked
out. Teammates report otherwise.
Some reports said the free-spirited
defensive senior didn’t know the
score of the game until halftime.

Whether he was knocked out or
not isn’t really important. What is
important about the situation was
the way Wilson came back to play.

Wilson, you probably have
guessed by now, does some
surprising things. And some not so
surprising ones, like knocking down

opponents’ passes, as he did in
Saturday’s 17-l7 game between Pitt
and Florida in Gainesville.

Wilson and the rest of the
Panthers’ crack defensive second-
ary held the speedy Florida
receivers to only 64 yards while
batting down several last-second
Gator passes when Florida, with the
ball in Pitt territory and a few
seconds remaining in the game, had
started what appeared to be a
' uchdown.

 

 

“Sometimes I have the tendency
to play the ball instead of the
receiver,” Wilson said. “Coach
(defensive backfield Larry) Holten
wants me to cut down taking
unncessary chances like that. I get
beat a lot when I do stuff like that.”
yhsy-”

Wilson gets dizzy, too, even when
he takes necessary chances, as he
did in that Pitt-Temple game
several weeks ago. It’s just part of
J .C. Wilson’s death-defying style.

Gator, Sun, Liberty, Peach: Take Your Pick

Random notes prompted, for the most part,
by watching the Pitt-Florida game on television
while listening to Bill Hillgrove’s radio play-
by-play:

It will be noted by the major‘ bowl selection
committees that when the time comes to issue
invitations, Pitt will not have beaten a good
college football team, no matter what the Pan-
thers’ record. . If Pitt goes to a major
bowl—and it says here it won’t——it will be
because of other schools’ losses, not Pitt’s at-
tractiveness....

But I still plan to have a good time visiting

V ‘ the South between terms, even if it is hard to

ex.

/ecome excited about the Gator Bowl...

Matt Cavanaugh has perhaps the best college
arm around, but he wasn’t ready for Florida.
The kid has guts, but you can't wrap them
around a bum wrist...

Hugh Green will be all-America before he is
through here, but the fact he won’t be named
this year is largely the result of seniority. Senior
Willie Fry will be honored as the second end,
though Green is better...

Matt Cavanaugh, in his present condition,
makes the offense much more exciting, but no
more effective, than it is with Rick Trocano. A

‘ healthy Cavanaugh may well be the best quar-

terback in the country, but his cast got in the
way several times Saturday night. Not only did
he fumble more times than is normal or accep-
table, but he also failed to recover one—when
he should have—because he couldn’t cradle the
ball with his left forearm. That’s not his
fault—his desire and fortitude were ad-
mirable——but it was someone’s...

And I’m not sure whose...

As good as Cavanaugh’s effort and the game
were, the staged “interview” with Chancellor
Posvar and Vice Chancellor Kobosky—com-
plete with slides—was so distasteful as to cause
one to look longingly at the radio (even though
that was WTAE, too). Pitt has a good cause in
its fight for state funding, but hanging out a

  
 

blue-and-gold crying towel at halftime isn’t the
way to further it. It was hard to determine the
point at which the “game coverage” ended and
the commercial began...

The Sun Bo avl might not be too bad...

JoJo Heath should touch the football as of-
ten as can be arranged. Fred Jacobs is a good

  

runner and Gordon Jones is my favorite retur-
ner, but I like JoJo. After throwing an effec-
tive, if awkward, touchdown pass, Heath made
the tackle on the kickoff. All he needs now is 5
flashy nickname... 1

Jackie Sherrill must have either cringed or
smirked each time Florida coach Doug Dickey
sent his two quarterbacks, Terry LeCount and
John Brantley, deep on kickoffs. The cringe
would come from envying Dickey’s wealth; the
smirk from his experience with quarterbacks
who run into shoulder pads...

The Pitt defense should gang-tackle every
writer who doesn’t give it credit for being the
nation’s best. It is very hard to win if your of-
fense fumbles ll times and hands the other
team a pair of touchdowns. Unless you have
the Panther defense...

It must have been easy for Pitt fans to tire of
watching three Florida defenders dance off the
field with arms raised, one player holding a
recently recovered football. And if you think
you were tired of it, imagine how Pitt’s defense
felt...

The Liberty Bowl wouldn’t be too bad...

Heath, Randy Reutershan and Willie Taylor
give Pitt an offense exciting as any in the coun-
try. Now, if they could only score when they
had to...

With all the excitement, it was easy not to

notice that Pitt and Florida were extremely
sloppy on of fense.

Only three or four teams in the country are
better than a Pitt team playing with a healthy
Cavanaugh...

The Fiesta Bowl was nice...

If Cavanaugh plays and is not hampered by
that cast, Pitt should kill Penn State...

But that will be too late to help Pitt in the
bowl race. Bids will be week old by then...

Jim Buoy, Bill Niell, Al Chesley and Hugh
Green deserve special mention for outstanding
play against Florida...

Damaged as Matt Cavanaugh was, Florida
still was sufficiently scared of his arm to allow
Fred Jacobs to move freely on draw plays.
When Cavanaugh went back two steps,
Florida's pass coverage turned tail and ran...

“We’ve got a hell of a football team,”
Sherrill said after the game. “This was our first
big test...and our kids passed that.” Perhaps,
since a C would be a fair grade for each team in
a tie between relative equals, but here’s how I
rate Pitt: Give the defense an A for everything,
and give the offense, despite some good attem-
pts, an F, largely as in fumble...

Matt Cavanaugh’s post-game statement that
the cast didn’t bother him shows him to be a
good guy who wouldn’t dream of leaving his
coach open to criticism...

I should be so nice...

Why is it that Matt Cavanaugh always seems
to get hit harder than anyone else?...

Were I Art Rooney, the first thing I would do
(after trading Mel Blount and Jack Lambert)
would be to draft Matt Cavanaugh...

The second thing would be to try to acquire
future rights to Hugh Green...

I could even go for the Peach Bowl...

Pantherettes Overwhelmed

Pitt's schedule, which has
become increasingly difficult since
the team’s inception in 1974,
included four tough opponents:
Calvin, Ashland, Dayton and the
host team, Cleveland State.

In addition, injuries to two of the

Panthers’ Fumblitis Enough
To Sway Pollsters" ‘Thinking

By JOHN FINN
Pitt News Staff Writer

A difficult schedule and several
untimely injuries cought up with the
Pantherette volleyball team in
Cleveland Saturday, as Pitt
managed to win only one of four
matches in the Cleveland State
quadrangular tournament this
weekend.

(Continued from Page 2])

the Panthers hardly could be awarded a higher ranking after their
sloppy play.

Three games and 11 fumbles-later, pitt still was unable to crack
the Top Ten barrier. Even though the Panthers were able to win
those three games, impressively for the most part, pollsters
‘generally remained unimpressed.

Facing their toughest challenge of the year, the Panthers took
their three-game winning streak into Gainsville with a chance to
cause some real eye-opening—not only for the pollsters, but for the
several Orange Bowl committee members in attendance.

Alas, as it did in the Notre Dame affair, Pitt played butter-
fingers, fumbling at; outrageous total of 11 times (losing six) that,
along with a blocked Joe Gasporovic punt, all but disqualified the
Panthers from any consideration for a major bowl berth. While
the six lost fumbles were bad enough, many of the five that Pitt
recaptured resulted in drive-thwarting losses.

/

Fourteen Florida points were gifts, direct results of a fumble and
the muffed punt, but it’s ironic that the Gators’ only legitimate
score tied the game with 1:26 to play. Florida actually had to work
in order to drive the ball downfield, capping the effort with a 28-
yard field goal by Berj Yepremian.

The turning point in the game involved (you guessed it) a Panther
fumble. Leading, 14-7, the Panthers had a chance to blow the
game open late in the third period with a second down and goal
from the Gator two-yard line Cavanaugh fumbled, and from there
the Panthers had to scratch and claw just to escape with a 17-17
tie—-as much a moral victory for Florida as a demoralizing effort
for the Panthers.

The Pitt-Florida game did nothing for the Panthers except show
the pollsters that one team can almost double its opposition in total
yardage (399 to 217) yet fail to emerge victorious. And if that isn’t
enough, it is doubly amazing that Pitt, with a 3-1-1 record, could
have managed to out-fumble its opposition, 30-22.

While many knowledgeable football experts say a Pitt team with
a healthy Matt Cavanaugh at least deserves a number-five ranking,
the Panthers never will achieve anything higher than a post-season
Wiener Bowl bid unless the fumbles disappearimmediately.

Shafer to juggle the lineup in each
game.

Perez suffered a twisted knee at
the Pitt Invitational and will be out
of the lineup indeﬁnitely. Mueller
suffered a pulled muscle in her neck
and saw only limited action.

Pitt didn’t ﬁnd the winning
combination until the ﬁnal match of
the day against Ashland College.

In the first match, the Pantheret-
tes stormed past Calvin, 15-2, in the
ﬁrst game, but dropped the next
two games and lost the match, 2-1.

With a different lineup in each of 3

the next two matches, Pitt bowed to
Cleveland State and Dayton by
identical 2-1 scores.

Hebert offered several other
reasons for the Pantherettes’
disappointing performance.

“We made an incredible amount
of mistakes,” he said, “but our
main problem is that we are still
searching for that winning
combination.

“The girls really are working
hard and their skills are im-
proving,” Hebert added.

under a lot of pressure from the
pre-season publicity that acclaimed
Pitt as one of the top teams in the
East.”

Pitt’ s record now is 9-4, and much
of its future success depends on its

ability to overcome pressure and 53

play up to its potential.

HOUSTON [AP]—Houston in-
tercepted four Terry Bradshaw
passes in the ﬁrst half and took the
lead in the third quarter on Dan
Pastorini‘s 51-yard touchdown
bomb to Billy Johnson to upset
Pittsburgh 27-10 Sunday and take
over ﬁrst place in the AFC Central
Division.

The brutally-played American
Football Conference game was
costly to both teams. The Steeleers
lost Bradshaw shortly before
halftime with a fractured left wrist
and Pastorini went down with a
sprained right ankle with 51 seconds
to go in the third quarter.

The victory boosted Houston to a
3-1 record while Pittsburgh dropped
into second place with a 2-2 record.

Houston, which had lost nine of its
last 10 games against the Steelers,
trailed 10-7 at the half but tied it on
Toni Fritsch’s 27-yard ﬁeld goal
early in the third quarter.

The Oilers went ahead moments
later, when Pastorini hit Johnson at
the Steeler 15 after Johnson had
beaten Steeler cornerback Mel
Blount. t

Houston iced the game early in
the fourth quarter, when Houston
defender Greg Stemrick picked up a
fumble by Pittsburgh quarterback
Tony Dungy and ran ﬁve yards into
the end zone. '

Rocky Bleier fumbled and safety
Mile Reinfeldt returned it 15 yards
to set up an 18-yard ﬁeld goal by
Fritsch.

Pittsburgh struggled to a 10-7
halftime lead on a one yard plunge
by Bleier and Roy Gerela‘s 27-yard
ﬁeld goal. Houston scored on a
44-yard halfback pass from Ronnie

Coleman to Ken Burrough.

, Houston‘s first half intercep-
tions, two of them in the Oiler end
zone, kept the Oilers alive in the
game. Stemrick intercepted
Bradshaw‘s second pass of the end
zone.

Linebacker Ted Washington
picked off a pass in the end zone
with 28 seconds left in the half.

Quarterback Mike Kruczek, who
replaced Bradshaw in the third
quarter, went out with a bruised
shoulder on the ﬁrst play of he
fourth period and was replaﬁ y
Dungy, who is listed as a safety in
the Steeler program.

Dungy, a rookie free agent from
Minnesota, was intercepted twice in
the ﬁnal minutes by Reinfeldt.
Reinfeldt returned his second
interception 19 yards on the ﬁnal
play of the game.

The Oiler defense, which ranks
far behind the league-leading
Pittsburgh Steel Curtain defense,
asserted itself from the ﬁrst
quarter, when Stemrich stopped the
Steelers‘ ﬁrst drive with his end
zone interception.

Moments later, Cliff Parsley
punted to the Steeler sevenand

Houston‘s defense forcedi  ‘s-
burgh to punt from the six after four
plays.

Houston took over at its own 44
and, on the ﬁrst play, Pastorini
pitched to Coleman, who threw to
Burrough in the end zone on ﬁrst
down.

Pittsburgh drove to Houston’s 14
on its next series, but forced to
settle for Gerela‘s 27-yard field goal
after the Oiler defense once again
stopped the Steelers at the 10.

Pittsburgh turned an exchange of
interceptions in a 10-7 halftime lead.

Everyone was‘ injured in the Pittsburgh Steelers-Houston Oilers contest
yesterday. Jack Lambert, starting Steeler linebacker, accidentally clubbed the
head Iinesman, who wobbled off the field. Lambert received no penalty.

By BOB LABRIOLA

The Pitt soccer team's highly
powered offense came to a grinding
halt Friday Bucknell blanked‘ the
Panthers. l-O. at Pitt Stadium.

The deciding goal was scored
with only 2:15 remaining as
B_ucknell’s Tim St.George decked
Panther goalie Frank Bucci and
drove the ball into the open net.
Pitt outshot the Bisons 18-12. and
had more corner kicks. 4-3. but
failed to break into the scoring
column for the ﬁrst time this
season.

Bucknell concentrated on defen-

only two men down on offense until
the ball was advanced deep into
Panther territory.

“We didn't play bad enough to
lose. but we also didn't deserve to
win either." Pitt head coach Leo
Bemis explained. ‘‘In the last four
years. all our games with Bucknell
have been decided by one goal.
This was just one of those games
where we were in control, but
couldn't put the ball into the net."

With only the top four Pennsyl-
vania teams invited to the Division
I playoffs. this loss could come back
tmhaunt Pitt. The Panther's record
dropped to 1-4-1. while Bucknell is
now 2-2-2. Pitt's~ne.\'t match is

Weekends like the past one only
seem to come along once a
year..which is probably just as well
for the peace of mind of the
nation’s college football coaches.

This is all that happened, folks:

—The nation’s longest winning
streak came to an end at 15 games
when seventh-ranked Alabama
held off number one rated Southern
California. 21-20.

——Texas Christian snapped the
nation’s longest losing streak at 15

:{‘]Bnes by downing Rice, 35-15, in a

‘contest that set records for
penalties against one team (TCU),
22 and two teams, 34.

—The second-ranked Oklahome
Sooners joined Southern Cal in the
losers’ circle when the for-real
Texas Longhorns, ranked ﬁfth,
beat them for the ﬁrst time in seven
years, 13-6, under the direction of
third string quarterback Greg
McEachern.

-Brigham Young, ranked 13th,
lost a ballgame to Oregon State,
24-19, after squandering a 19-0 lead
and quarterback Gifford Nielsen for
the season with a knee injury.

—— While Nielsen went down,
‘°itt’s-Matt Cavanaugh returned to
 ction for the first time since an
opening-game injury. He fumbled
the ball away three times but also
drove the 15th-ranked Panthers to a
pair of touchdown in a 17-17
standoff with No. 20 Florida.

Naturally, it was up to Michi-

State’s Woody Hayes to keep the
world in some kind of orderly state,
so third-ranked Michigan defeated
Michigan State 24-14 while No. 4
Ohio State ﬂattened Purdue 46-0.
Woody and B0, of course‘ are
building up to another classic Big
Ten showdown—save that line,
sports editors; it should be
fashionable for the forseeable
furture——Nov. 19.

Elsewhere, sixth-ranked Color-
ado turned back Oklahoma State,
29-13, as James Mayberry outrush-
ed the Cowboys’ heralded Terry
Miller 250 yards to 139; No. 9
Nebraska beat Kansas State, 26-9.
with I.M. Hipp bolting for touch-
downs of 88 and 62 yards in his
total of 297—he had 254 last

two key turnovers in the ﬁnal
period to ﬁght off Utah State, 16-7.

Three Top Twenty teams had the
weekend off - Arkansas, which is
tied for seventh with Alabama, and
meets Texas next Saturday, No. 11
Notre Dame and No. 12 Texas
A&M.

Alabama's triumph over USC in
Los Angeles drew a turnout of
about 4.000—— the largest contin-
gent ever to congregate at
Tuscaloosa Municipal "Airport-—to
greet the team when it returned
home early Sunday. Extra police
were needed to direct trafﬁc as
happy Alabamans honked their
autamabile horns and hollered
“Roll Tide.”

Tony Nathan’s touchdown runs
of one and 13 yards early in the ﬁnal
period helped the Crimson Tide to

a 21-6 lead.’ But USC’s Rob Hertel
threw a touchdown pass to Calvin
Sweeney and a two-point conver-
sion toss to Mosi Tatupu with 6:46
remaining and Lynn Capn scored
from a yard out with 39 seconds
left. This time, however, Hertel’s
conversion pass was intercepted by
Barry Krauss.

“I think we got a little help from

' upstairs,” said Alabama’s Bear

Bryant. “We were lucky to get out
of it. I’ve never seen a team come
back so strong as they did.

“There were actually three
different games. We had an even
ﬁrst half, we won the ﬁrst half of
the second half and they won the
second half of the second half.”

Huh? ' =

While Alabama was providing
Southern Cal with an unhappy
Hollywood ending, Texas ‘ was
writing a pretty unbelieveable
script of its own against Oklahoma.

“You might see something like
that in a story book, maybe make a
movie about it, but I’ve never seen
anything like that,” said Coach
Fred Akers. ’

He was referring to McEachern’s
leadership in only his second
varsity game after two quarter-
backs were injured; the running of
Earl Campbell, who rushed for 124
yards and scored 24 yards out in
the second period after McEachern
hit Alfred Jackson with passes of 23
and 18 yards and ﬁeld goals of 64
and 58 yards by Russell Erxleben,
who set a major college record with
a 67-yarder just one week ago.

Finally, Brad Shearer and
Johnnie Johnson capped a tremen-
dous defensive effort by stopping
Oklahoma quarterback Thomas
Lott for no gain on fourth-and-one
at the Texas ﬁve-yard line in the
closing minutes.

“I told Fred Akers after the-
game I hope they win the rest of

them and the national champion-
ship,” said Oklahoma’s Barry
Switzer. “They have a great, great
football team. Campbell is just
unbelievable and I told him I hope
he wins the Heisman Trophoy.’~’

Rick Leach passed for one‘TD
and ran for another to lead
Michigan past Michigan State,
freshman fullback Joel Payton
scored four times as Ohio State
routed Purdue and Colorado
withstood Terry Miller’s 13th
consecutive 100-yard effort in
beating Oklahoma State.

Besides Colorado’s Mayberry,
Nebraska’s Isaiah Moses Walter
“_I.M.” Hipp also overshadowed
Miller in the Big Eight rushing
race. “Getting a lot of yards is‘ a
good thing for me, but I did it for
the team,” he said “I don’t believe
I’m the best in the Big Eight. I’m
not a braggart. Ijust do my job.”

Tackle Bruce Clark forced a
fumble and an interception in the
ﬁnal period, enabling Penn State to
erase a 7-6 deﬁcit against Utah
State and avert what would have
been a stunning upset.

BYU’s Nielsen, who had never
suffered a serious football injury,
was hurt on the last play‘ of the
third quarter, a quarterback sneak
that failed to pick up a ﬁrst down.
Earlier he threw three touchdown
passes but also suffered his ﬁrst
three interceptions of the season.

“I thought I had that ﬁrst
down,” said the nation’s leading
passer. “I didn’t shove underneath
the pile. I probably should have.”

In other notable developments:

—-Princeton snapped a 12-game
home losing streak with a 28-7
victory over Columbia.

-—North Carolina State junior
Ted Brown gained 67 yards in a
17-15 trimph over Auburn and set a
school career rushing mark of
2,576.
