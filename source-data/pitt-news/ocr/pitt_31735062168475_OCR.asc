eampus functions which are held

are very grateful to Mr. Falk for
this most generous gift. His con-
tinuing generosity to the_ Univer-

Miss Frick’s Lawyer  
Discusses Litigation; 
Attacks Stevens’ Book

By BILL CABIN
(The following article is based on
an interview between Mr. Cabin
and Mr. David Buerger in Mr.
Bue'rger’s‘Pittsbu'rgh office. See
Editorial on Page 4.)

Does a historian have the.

right to make conclusions
based on incomplete histori-
cal evidence? Mr. David B.
‘Buerger, attorney for Miss
Helen Clay Frick, contends
that historians cannot make
conclusions if there exists
historical facts contrary to
their supportive evidence.

Mr. Buerger is attorney for the
plaintiff in Miss Frick’s suit
against historian Sylvester K.
Stevens. She accuses Stevens of
making “false, scandalous, mali-
cious, and defamatory” state-
ments about her father, deceased
‘industrialist Henry Clay Frick, in
his book, Pennsylvania — Birth-
place of a Nation. The suit began
in January, 1965, and decision is
currently in Common Pleas Court
in Carlisle, Pa. Stevens’ attorney
also has an appeal pending for
the United States District Court
in New York to intervene on the
grounds the suit violates the de-
fendant’s constitutional right .of
free press.

Peace Corps Sponsors A
Pitt Recruiting Drive

BY BERNI McLEOD

Five Peace Corps members,
once stationed ‘in countries all
over the world, are at the Uni-
versity this week, making one
stop of many during their 1966

-campus recruitment drive.

In preparationxfon their stay,
an , “advance team” visited the
University several days ago, mak-

\ing arrangements for movies, pos-

ters and lectures. The “team”
also asked department heads and
professors for class time in which
to present information and ideas
about the Peace Corp.

Doris Witriol, a green-eyed New
Yorker, once stationed in Iran, is
one of the ﬁve recruiters. While
a student at the City College of
New York, Miss Witriol became
interested in the Peace Corp.

"‘I'm' one of those perpetual
joinérs,” said Miss Witriol. “Nat-
urally, when I" saw a Peace Corp
booth in my college I signed up
for information. At the time I
was taking ﬁnals, and the Peace

Corps meant ‘getting away from,

it all.’ As I trained, _and as I
served in Iran, the Peace Corp
came tomean much, much more.”

Miss Witriol, .who wasitrained

ended up teaching English litera-
ture at the University of Isfah-
han. “I was told that we would
live in a. small town with a fam-
ily, and instead I‘ lived in one
of ,Iran’s most beautiful cities.
sharing an eight room house with
ﬁve other ‘Corps’ volunteers.”

Bob Lederman-, also on the re-
cruiting team, was a community
development agent in Venezuela.
The slim, dark-haired New York-

 er, also a graduate of the City

College of New York, had a back-
ground in sociology as prepara-
tion for his-job.

“We lived in a small town call-
ed An_aco, which is in the interi-
or of the country,” said Leder-
man. “Our job was to go in there
and ﬁnd out the people's needs.”

“The only Americans they had
known before,” he-added, “were
the oil company employees. The
indifference that the company
people showed the Venezuelans,
made them distrustful of all
Americans. By being sincere and
sympathetic, we did win their
friendship.”

The ﬁve volunteers will be sta-
tioned at ' tables in the Student
Union and‘ ground iﬂoor of the

“Miss Frick is not suing aca-' ‘U

ger, “because it is not academic.’ _
freedom to print lies. Weseek to “
enjoin Mr. Stevens from 
clearly and uneqivocally false
statements. He just isn't being a
historian.” ~ 
Mr. Buerger’s case rests on evi-
dence showing that Mr. Stevens-.
made statements about Henry
Clay Frick, despite the existence
of historical evidence contrary to
Stevens’ assertions. “His basicas-“
sumption that Mr. Frick had a
111011011015’ of 80 per cent of the
coal and coke in Western Penn,-*1
sylvania. in 1889 is incorrect,”
said Mr. Buerger. “Mr. Frickhad,
an 80 per cent monopoly on cok‘.
ing coal, but this constituted
about ﬁve percent of the total
coal and coke holdings in West;
ern Pennsylvania.” _ __

Mr. Buerger feels that Stevensf:
proceeded on this false assump-
tion and classiﬁed Mr. Frick with 
other “black capitalists” such. as
John Rockefeller, Jay Gould‘, and . I
Andrew Carnegie. He further
contends that Mr. Frick was “the
exception to the rule” as regards ,
the alleged inhumane practices 
of the late 19th century indus-
trialists. I

For instance, Stevens said~_.in
his book that “Frick also made
extensive use of immigrant la-
bor and cut wages to an average
of about $1.60 a day while.ex-
tracting the longest hours of work
physically possible.” Mr. Stevens
said during questioning that 
“the longest ‘hours of work phyg
sically possible” he meant 12
hours a day.

Seeger in Concert

By MARTY LIEBOWITZ

Pete Seeger is a weaver
of spells. At his concert Sat-
urday evening, he captivat-
ed his audience in Carnegie
Music . Hall with material
ranging‘ from a humorous
song, called “T_hey’re Gonna’
Bless the Pill,” to more serious
songs condemning the United
States involvement in Viet Nam.

While many folk performers

carry a list of songs attached to
their guitars, Pete’s ‘concerts have
no deﬁnite order. According to
Seeger, “. . . Every concert is
different; there ar eno two which
are alike.” Given this leeway,
what emerges is something spon-
taneous; it is a concert as reward-
ing to the performer as it is to
the audience. When Pete invites
the audience to join him in a
song, you are made to feel that
he is enjoying hearing you as
much as you him. When some-
one from the second balcony
yelled a request that Pete sing
“Abi Yo. Yo,” he replied: “You
know that if you ask for it in

-harmony, I couldn’t refuse you.”

Thereupon he told the story of
Abi Yo Yo the giant, through
the use of instruments, singing,
and" pantomime. A fantasy was
created which delighted the au-
dience, from the young pensive
six-year-olds, to the smiling eld-
ers.

The high-point of the ﬁrst half
of the concert occurred when
Pete sang “Bring Them Home,” a
song advocating removal of U.S.
boys from Viet Nam. By the time
he had ﬁnished, about a ‘dozen
people had given up their seats,
and some booding was heard.
But there was also prolonged ap-
plause. This varied response, in-
cited by lines such as: “They
want to test their weaponry; that
is their fallacy,” was something
new to be found at one of Pete
Seeger’s concerts.

Where his previous concerts
had revolved around the Civil
Rights theme, and where the con-
cluding song “We Shall Over-
come,” was sung in friendship

now, a different atmosphere was
present—one of uncertainty. Con-
cerning the people who had left
the concert hall during “Bring
Them Home,” Pete said: “People
don’t have to approve of every-
thing I sing, but they should at
least approach the material with
an open mind.”

Pete Seeger is an artist, but he
is more; he is a legend. He is
one of the few folk performers
left of the group which included
Woody Gutherie and Leadbelly.
Folk music, like any art form,

runs the risk of being viewed

superﬁcially and of being forgot-
ten. In his concert Saturday, Pete
Seeger made his general material
subservient to a theme which he
felt important —our involvement
in Viet Nam. '

Pete ended this concert with
“Where Have All the Flowers
Gone,’{ his own composition. Al-
though the popularly known ver.-
sion of this song, sung by Peter;
Paul and Mary, ends with:

“Where have all the graveyards ‘

gone? Gone to ﬂowers everyone,“
Pete ended his with: “Where
have all the young men gone?
Gone to soldiers everyone.” This,
according to Seeger, was the way
he had originally wrote the song,
leaving it open to hope and inter-
pretation, rather than to a state-
ment that death is inevitable.

   

Mozart, Strauss Works

By ADRIENNE MILLER

Dr. William Steinberg opens
this week’s well balanced pro-
gram with the Short Symphony
by Aaron Copland. Best known.
for the orchestral scores Billy the
Kid and Rodeo, Copland spent
six years perfecting the 15 min-
ute Short Symphony. “If I ex-
pended so much time and effort
on the Short Symphony, said
Copland, “It was because I wish-
ed to write as perfected a piece
as I possibly could.’’ While com-
posing this work, Copland became
fascinated with Hebrew liturgic-
al music. This inﬁuence is clearly
heard in the slow movement of
Copland’s
based on agcantorial lament.

It has been said that only
great artists and little children
can play Mozart. There is a
great deal of truth in this cliche.
A child, not realizing the inward
complexity of the music, plays
Mozart with great freedom. How-
ever, most artists, in trying to
achieve technical perfection, lose
the simple child-like beauty of
the music. Only the great artist
can do both. Grant Johannesen,

this week’s piano soloist, has _‘
been hailed in Europe, America,‘

and the Soviet Union as a great
artist. Johannessen will perform
Mozart’s Concerto No. 21.

The program closes with Rich-
ard Strauss’ Don Quixote. In this
musical version of» Cervantes’
novel, Don Quixote and his faith-
ful companion, Sancho Panza
(the Batman and Robin of Old

-Spain), are portrayed by solo
cello and viola, respectively.
Strauss retells the story though
ten musical variations based on
selected chapters from the novel.

 tant reasons, First, SG serves
  as the best link between stu-
”  dents and administration.
Secondly, SG’s role is to ex-
if-tert student control over Stu-
ldent Affairs. While I did il-
lustrate that SG has failed
at the University_and should
“be changed, I did not give
“the Chancelolr and the Dean
,_any' concrete reasons for its
‘failure, norjdid I propose
‘any solutions to the prob-
lems. Now I will list the
; causes of our weak SG. Then
» I will show how the proposed
_SG constitution can elimin-
Zate them. Thus, I will make
:the new Constitution a mean-
_ingful _and urgent document
~*-to all University students.
The structure of SG is in-
A, herently weak. The present
-SGO Constitution reads, “All
1 SG. authority over student af-
: fairs derives from the Board
;’:of Trustees of the Universi-
7"ty,' and the exercise of said
, authority proceeds through
«the Chancellor and the Dean
pf Student Affairs.” No won-
‘der the Administration has
feen involved in the rightful
omain of SG. No wonder
he'Dean of Students was
ble to decide how to appoint
embers to the Student Al-
;1_o”cations Committee. The
5-new SG Constitution states
ifthat SG is “to provide for
?‘the structure of student au-
, hority in student affairs.”
 Thus, it becomes incum-
“ ent upon the SG to become
he prime decisi-on making
_ ody in the -area of student
ij-affairs. Students will at last
3be able to decide for them-
jselves.-This is" not a transfer
j’of power from other student
'%’.organizations such as IFC,
*WS,. MDC, etc., to SG but
ather a transfer from the
‘dministration to the SG; it
ill center power on students
ather than administrators.
?-:Indeed,. in order to insure the
integrity of other student or-
, anizations and toprevent a
“tyranny of_ SG” the new

Editorial. The Frick Scylla & Charyhdls  

The Henry Clay Frick biography case can quickly become an aca-

demic Scylla and Charybdis. On the one side of the problem is the crucial

issue of freedom of intellectual expression. On the other side you are
faced with the touchy subject of protection under law of a deceased man’s

 Vested Interest

The Constitution

IN MY ﬁrst article, I ex- ‘

,- this campus for two impor- _

a1.‘deciS;i9I1 E-'9n...:Wheth'e. Q17 

 

When Mr. Frick’s daughter, multi-millionairess Helen Clay Frick,
first began her suit against historian Sylvester K. Stevens, many rallied
to the cause of academic freedom’. Historians and writers across the na-
tion felt that Miss Frick was trying to use her money and prestige to
suppress a factual study of her father's business career. ‘
' A nationalgroup, called the “Joint Committee for the Defense of
the Rights of Historians Under the First Amendment,” was formed. Mem-
bers of the Committee include national ﬁgures such as Penn Professor
_ Thomas C. Cochran and American Heritage editor Oliver 0. Jensen. Stev-
iiens’ lawyer argued that “A historian ought to be able to write history or,
?}.,for that matter a journalist ought to be able to write about events of
 the day without being enjoined from publishing.” The committee (if his-
itorians said that the Frick suit “if successful, would inhibit our right to
‘tospeak freely about the past based upon scholarly research.”

 However, the issues are not that simple. Miss Frick is certainly
 not asking for enjoinment simply -because the book criticizes her father,
-‘_-"but rather because of claimed “false statements” within the book. More-

of justice.

bounds. Thus the new con-
stitution answer the ﬁrst
prerequisite for an effective
student government, just
student authority in student
affairs.‘

JUST AS the structure of
SG has prevented it from as-
suming its proper role in
student affairs” does not pro-
of SG has prevented it from
assuming its proper role as
the communicator of student
opinion to the Administra-
tion. The present SG Consti-
tution, while extolling SG to
“express student opinion on
student affairs, does not pro-
vide any method for students
or organizations to communi-
cate directly their vital posi-
tions to SG. Thus, SG lead-

ers are forced. in dialogues A

with administrators to as-
sume rather than know what
student opinion is. Thus,
their remarks are more easi-
ly discounted. Furthermore.

SC is forced to compete with

an illeortimate body. the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee for
the ear of the Administra-
tion.

Why should the entire Uni-
versity undergo the rigors of
electing representatives to
express student opinion,
when another body already
has this function? I feel it
would be far better for those
organizations represented on
the SAC to communicate di-
rectly with SG, who would
then be able to bring a
strong uniﬁed student opin-
ion to those who shape the
University’s future. Would-
n’t ONE strong current of
student opinion have far
greater effect that eight sep-
arate streams. The Adminis-
stration would not disregard

V the uniﬁed opini-on of all stu-

dents. The new constitution
will bring about this uniﬁca-
tion; the new constitution
will make student opinion
a stronger force. ‘

THE PROPOSED Consti-
tution states ﬂatly that SG
f‘shall be the only represen-
tative body of all the stu-

dents of the Oakland Campus '

A  not

comes obsolete and com-
munication between admin-
istrator » and student" lies
wholly on SG. Yet, in order
that SG may speak at all
times for all students, the
new Constitution establishes
a President’s Council and a
General Assembly. The Gen-
eral Assembly will consist of
every recognized organiation
at the University and will
convene regularly to discuss
the problems of students.

The President’s Council
will consist of the very same
student leaders who sit on
the SAC, but instead of ad-
vising the Dean of Students,
they will advise the presi-
dent of SG. Thus. the gener-
al shape of student opinion
will be immediately available
to the SG -president who will
then be able to speak strong-
ly and conﬁdently to the Ad-
ministration. His opinion
would have a united student
‘body behind it and could not
be completely ignored. Stu-
dents will be heard.

Perhaps, I paint too rosy
a ‘picture of campus life “af-
ter the Constitution.”.The
new Constitution itself will
not make SG more effective,
only student support can do
this. Ask yourself, do stu-
dents have the right to guide
their own affairs? Do stu-
dents have the right to in-
fluence polices -that shape
the student’s future? If the
answer are yes, then you
must vote for the proposed
SG Constitution. It is time
for Pitt students to rise
above the morass of medio-

_ crity that pervades this cam-

pus.

It is time for Pitt students
to join the thousands of stu-
dents across the nation who
have given out the call for
“student’s rights.” An active
student body linked with the
new structure provided by
the proposed constitution
may very well go a long way
in correcting what ails Pitt.
A vote for the proposed SG
Constitution is a vote for
student rights. A Vote for
the proposed SG Constitu-
tion is a..vote for yourself. _

over, several points brought out by Miss ‘Frick’s attorney cast grave
doubts upon the supposed pristine accuracy of Stevens’ research.

-But the right of protection of the memory of the deceased is of
equal importance to the right of free expression. It is the duty of our
society to provide legal‘ means by which authors can be stopped from
making unfounded and malicious statements about the dead as well as
the living. Stevens has stated in his book, Pennsylvania-—Birthplace of a
Nation, that Frick paid. his workers low wages and charged them exorbi-
dant rents for poor housing.-He also asserted that Frick permitted his
employees to work in unsafe and unhealthy mines.

It "would be absurdgto attempt to try the case in this newspaper.
However, it is our contention that the issues of the case are not as clear
cut as some would claim. Important Constitutional rights are at stake
on both sides.

It is for that reason that members of the University Community
are not obligated to announce their position on this issue, simply to dem-
onstrate their preference for academic freedom. The case encompasses
crucial legal issues and, therefore, should be tried in our courts of law.
If-the case would be argued by pamphlet through the U.S. mails or in
articles, in the commercial press, then indeed» there would be a mockery

MDC Methodology

MEN’S DORMITORY Coun-
cil’s (MDC) trial period for
new dissemination of litera-
ture rules is methodological-
ly unsound. The four week
suspension of the old rules is
designed to “give the men
an opportunity to decide if
they want to keep the old
policy,” according to MDC
President Tom Meisner.
Meisner asserts that such

a trial period “will provide a.

fair examination of the.Tow-
ers policy” which currently
prohibits distribution of lit-
erature, on individual ﬂoors.
MDC senators will report the
feelings of the men and the
Senate will then act to re-
tain or dismiss the old rules
permanently.

While such an agreement
seems ‘fair and equitable to
both sides, it is neither fair
nor equitable for either side.
The four-week period cre-

-ates an unnatural situation

in which men are conscious-
ly aware that any act of
passing literature must be
judged on its degree of in-
vasion, of privacy. For those
who already oppose the new
rules ' it will be relatively
easy to create disturbing sit-

uations when trial-period lit- '

erature is distributed.

THE EXPERIMENTAL
period is also highly dissimi-
lar to normal conditions to-
which its. results will be ap-
plied. It forces those. people
who are advocating revision
of the rules to distribute
something merely for the
sake of distribution. If there
is no distribution during the
trial period, there will in es-
sence be no test.

Both the dorm residents
and those propounding new
dissemination rules are thus
placed in a poorly controlled
experiment. The question of
invasion of privacy vs. free
speech revolves around is-
sues which arises in unan-
ticipated situations. Such a

' question cannot be accurate-

ly judged by a four-week
period in which both sides
are placed in battle.

If a trial period of any na-

By Bill Cabin

ture is to. be imposed the
only fair trial would be a
trimester or entire academ-
ic year. This would allow
judgment on the basis of a
typical year’s activities, in-
cluding many crucial and un-
anticipated sitations where
the invasion of privacy and
free speech principles would

interact. Itxwould include po-

litical campaigns, activity in-
volving various types of cam-
pus issues, and reaction to
any local or national situa-
tion The Student Activities
Fee provides ample prece-
dent for such a trial period.
It is currently in its second
year on a trial basis.

NOT _ONLY IS the current
trial arrangement methodo-
logically unsound, but it de-
nies other. aspects involved
in any rules change. It does
not deal with the question of
internal consistency in Uni-
versity policy for literature
distribution in dormitory
areas. Women’s dormitories
currently have rules similar
to the proposed new rules for
men. Did they vote before

we the rules were imposed ? How

have the rules proved opera-~
tive?

The question of invasion
of privacy vs. free speech
should not be decided along
sexual lines. There should

be one set of rules to apply‘
to all living area,s_.4A consis-

tent philosophy in this area
would be determined by (1)
judgment of different‘ rules
at other Universities and
their effects, (2) the aggre-
gate opinion of current dorm
residents, and (3) the re-
sults of a methodologically
sound experiment period.

The questions involved in
the dissemination of litera-
ture rules ‘change are too
crucial to be judged by an
unscientiﬁc trial period, ne-
glect of evidencefrom other
schools, ’and without ques-
tioning policy consistency.
Both sides ha.ve cogent argu-
ments and they should be
judged by cogent methods if
both rsides are seeking an
‘equitable and lasting solu-
ion.

Prof Discusses
Penna. Tuition

Editor, The Pitt News:

As one who has successfully"
fought the good ﬁght against non-
resident tuition in another state
a few years ago, I have follow-
ed with interest the nescient
burblings in The Pitt News about
non-resident tuition at Pitt.

There are two balanced func-

 , tions performed by higher tui-

tion for non-resident students. In
times when money is hard to
come by, and this is all the time
for state legislatures, the non-
resident tuition differential oper-
ates inla free market to bring in
the maximum revenues While at
the same time limiting by re-
peated trial and error the propor-
tion of non-resident students to
-a value which the governing
body determines, in its wisdom
to be desirable.

While this is surely not the
best way to adjust this ratio
from an academic point of View
(able students of slender means

. .‘ may not apply from other states),
' it nevertheless has a long legis-

lative history.

In the current case, the legis-
lature will have to decide, on the
basis of its own emotions plus
such facts as may be presented
to it in the coming months,

.»whether having only 26 per cent

out-of-state freshmen will be det-
rimental to the state’s economy.

Pennsylvania is only now slow-
ly waking up to the relation be-
tween a good system of higher
education and state wealth, in
terms for instance of attracting

high quality industry and getting
larger pieces of the Federal pie.
One may predict that it will be

. many years behind other states

in removing tuition barriers to
able out-of-state students; a step
many more progressive states
have not yet undertaken.

In passing, one might guess
that legislative reapportionment,
which will give greater voice in
state legislatures to the cities,
may help to remedy this by plac-
ing in oﬂfice more men who can
see the economic value of sup-

, porting high academic standards.

In this matter, the Board of Trus-
tees may act as catalyst, but the
ﬁnal decision as to how far to
reduce non-resident tuition will
lie in Harrisburg. ‘

Finally, it mightsbe suggested
that here is an area where pri-
vateiphilanthropy might be able
to raise student quality: by pro-
viding a large number of stip-
ends based only on academic
promise (high school perform-
ance in the case of prospective
freshmen), it could encourage the
entrance of high quality students

   

from out-of-state‘ on a competitiv
basis.

Several blocks down from the Berkeley Coliseum a
booth was operating. Signs plastered on the sides of t..e

L" Allweek long cars had been cruising up and down the stree-.s
“of the campus announcing rallies to deal with the recent

By MIKE BROURMAN

When Art Richardson limped off the
Michigan State field with six minutes left,
it marked the ﬁrst time that he had missed
a minute of action since he broke into the soccer
lineup as a sophomore two years ago. If this seems
incredible, in‘ a bruising sport like soccer, what
is even more incredible is that he played at all.

For Art ‘Richardson played against MSU with
a very badly bruised leg, an injury suffered when
he was bumped by a freshman in the scrimmage
three days before the game. The leg was so bad
that neither the trainer nor coach Leo Bemis nor
Richardson himself thought that he would play.
“I was even doubtful Saturday morning before the

game,” he said.

But when -the game began, there was Richard-
son in his familiar spot at right fullback. And,
although the Spartans dented the defense for six
goals, none of these were scored on him.,In fact,
in his three years of varsity ball, only one goal
has been scored against him, and that was by
All-America Bobby Lieb of West Chester last year.

“In our defense, I usually cover the left wing
man to man. When I go into a game, I consider. it
a personal challenge between me and the wing.
When ever he gets the ball, VI don’t feel that he

can get around me.”

Art credits this attitude to his freshman coach
Bob ‘McNulty. “He taught me that and also to
never give up. You can’t be a winner without_

them.”

For Richardson, soccer came late in life. At
Monongahela High School he wanted to be a
baseball player. “But, I was a ‘stuck-up’ sopho-
more and the coach kept me on the bench, so I

team. Then, when he was a. senior, “some of the

guys on the team talked me into playing‘. That was _
the ﬁrst time I ever played the game.”

So, when he came to Pitt, he was far from a
polished performer. But, he was willing to do
something about it. “When I came here,” he said,
“I knew -Ineeded something to compensate for my
lack of game sense, so I worked on my speed. At
ﬁrst, practically everybody on the team could beat
me.” But they can’t anymore. He now runs the
hundred in 9.9 seconds.

It is not his speed, however, that has made him
theiperformer he is today. He credits two former
Pitt soccer s-tars, Dave Reichenbach and Tom Staab
with developing his play. “When I was a fresh-
man, Dave was the left wing, so I had to play

him man to man. He spent hours with me, show-

ing me the moves a wing makes on you. To this
day he is the best wing I’ve ever seen.”

Tom Staab was the goalie that year, and he
helped develop A1't’s game sense. “I didn’t know
the "fullback position and he told we where to
play and what to do. These guys and Mr. Bemis
turned me from nothing into a soccer player-”

Despite the booters’ early losses, Art is still _
optimistici about their chances of going to the

' NCAfA championship. But, he knows they can’t af-
ford anymore mistakes. “From here on, we've got

Petro Opens
Frosh Drills;
FWVU Awaits

By ROY JACOBS

A week and a half isn’t
very much time to get
thirty-three bodies ready to
play organized football, but that
is the task freshman coach Steve

.Petro is faced with this week.
The frosh open their four game
schedule next Friday, October 14,
against West Virginia: *

“We haven’t even started,” said
Petro, explaining that up to now
the freshmen have been practic-
ing as the varsity’s opponents.
“On offense we have four plays
left and right, but on defense we
have no setup at all.

The boys started working as a
unit Monday with a 30 minute
practice of their own. Tomorrow
Petro plans to work with them
for 45 minutes and for at least
an hour on Friday. The coach
added, “We hope to have some
semblance of a scrimmage by the
end of the week.

Game plans are still indeﬁnite,
but Petro plans to play every-
body equally to try “ﬁnding out

if they are progressing‘ at all.”?

All will workout this week of-
fensively and defensively. As of
now there are no specialists, and
the coach doesn’t expect there
will be. .

Petro is faced with the unusual
problem of having ﬁve quarter-—
backs on hand: George Medich,
J eﬁ‘ Barr, Chuck Winters, Frank
Gustine, and Ray Reppert. A

sixth, Joe Laws, was hurt in an ..

automobile accident. Petro has no
idea now who will start, but he
emphasized that all ﬁve will play
defense at either halfback or

Five Players Out  

Q",

Panther In juries Mount, 
F orce Lineup Changes

- By ANDY SWARTZ
There still might be time enough left before the walls
of Jericho come tumbling down on head coach Dave Hart and

his assistants.

After California, however, Hart better putlin a request
for more cement. Again last Saturday, the Panthers lost

their own game. Again last Sat-
urday, they lost essentials to a
solid establishment.

Two more key players were
lost. Defensive middle linebacker
Jim Flanigan, the main support,

stretched ligaments in his right _

knee. Wingback Skip Orszulak
fractured the middle ﬁnger of his
left hand. Both will miss the
West Virginia game at the Stadi-
um Saturday.

These two were added to the
list of doubtful starters [which
includes tailback Dewey Chester
and defensive tackles Greg Kel-

*—~ler and John Schmidt. Dave‘

Drake, another defensive tackle,
twisted his knee but should be
ready for the Mountaineers. ”

With an injury list deeper than
his '(two-deep) depth chart, Hart
appeared disappointed for the
third straight week. Again his
team had let an opposing player
run back a punt for a touchdown,

‘ but California won in the ﬁrst

11% minutes of the game.
Wayne Stewart a 6-7 basketball

player, intercepted an Ed James

pass and ran 47 yards for a 6-0
lead early in the game. Then
Hart for the second week-in-a-
row called a running play on
fourth down and short yardage.
Again, it ‘failed. In nine plays,
Cal scored on Dan Berry’s four
yard bolt,’ making it 13-0.

“I sure erred ,_ when we tried
for short yardage,” Hart said,

_“but that ’punt return broke our A

the other to Bob Longo for 20

yards. James added to his statis- «
tics. He now has thrown 77 times,

completing 41 for 484 yards.

Longo, whowas double-teamed
throughout the game, managed
only three receptions for 66 yards.‘
His season total reads 22 recep-
tions for 320 yards. Jones added
30' yards to his two game rush-
ing total of 46 while fullback
Mike Raklewicz passed the in-
jured Chester in total yardage
with 95 on 25 carries.

Thus the Panthers have been
outnumbered, outsized, and out-
lucked in the ﬁrst three games

5 and Hart must again rearrange

his lineup due to injuries. How.
ever, scouting coach Darrell Lew-
is feels the Panthers meet a team
Very similar to themselves in

Frank Handleman Bids
Farewell to Part of Life
When Running Stops

By GEORGE LIES
A part of Frank Handelman’s life will die in several

months.

Handelman has been running track and cross-

country for the past six years, earning four letters in track

while attending Cleveland Heights
high school and will have earned
ﬁve letters at Pitt by the con-
clusion of this season.

Handelman runs the mile and
half mile for the track team and
is the number one harrier on the
cross-country team. In last week’s
meet with Ohio University and
Kent State, Handelman ﬁnished
fourth with a time of 26:10 be-
hind three potential All-Ameri-
cans. “

His only regret is that he has
to graduate this year as he feels
that Pitt will become one of the
ﬁnest track schools in the coun-
try behind the coaching of Jim
Banner. “I have the highest re-
gard for Jim Banner. He has a
deep personal interest in all mem-
bers of the track and cross-coun-
try teams and he knows how to
develop his squads into top
shape.”

Ever since Handelman’s sopho-
more year he has been able to
Post times under 23 minut-es on
the 4.2 mile Schenley course. His
best time is 22:43. All he says
about meet plans is to get out in
front as fast as you can, and stay
there.

He believes in running a mini-
mum of ten miles daily all year
in order to stay in the best
possible physical shape. “The key
to success as a distance run-
ner is practice. I worked out all
last summer in order to stay in
shape.”

Being a senior, this is his last

year of running for Pitt and he
hopes to make this his ﬁnest sea-
son. Even though the harriers
have a one-and-two record. Han-
delman feels that the team can
go on to win their remaining four
meets and hopefully place in the
IC4A meet held in New York on
Nov. 14.

Frick Lawyer Discusses Case

(Continued from Page 1)

Mr. Buerger and his associates
have found historical evidence
contrary to this and other state-
ments -and claim that Stevens’
comments are therefore malicious.
“We obtained papers from that
period in Connellsville, the loca-
tion of the Frick mines,” said Mr.
Buerger, “and they said that the
union agreement with Frick spe-
ciﬁed nine hours.”-

“Stevens said that wages were
cut to $1.60 in 1886.” said Mr.
Buerger. “We produced papers
showing that wages went up 15
per cent in that year. Then Mr.
Stevens said he meant 1889. We
produced papers showing wages
‘for Frick employees increasing

12 per cent in 1889. He then said
he meant 1890 and we produced
papers showing wage increases
of 26 per cent in that year.”

Another example of incomplete

accounting of historical evidence
by Stevens involves statements
about the living quarters of Frick
employees. Stevens asserts that
Frick employees lived in “shawdy
wooden houses at high rents,”
according to Mr. Buerger. “I ask-
ed why he came to this conclu-
sion,” said Mr. Buerger, “and he
said that all coal workers lived
under such conditions. Yet we
found an 1894 report by the Bu-
reau of Mines of the Pennsyl-
vania Department of Internal Af-
fairs. It said that Frick employees
paid a rent of $2-$4 a month and
received free coa1.” Mr. Buerger
concludes that “Frick was not
like everybody else.” _

Mr. Buerger also revealed fur-
ther “shawdy research” which
he is exposing in the suit. He
questioned Mr. Stevens source
for the statement on long hours
and Stevens said it was based on
conditions in 1869, reported by a
historian named McCally (sic.).
“But Mr. Frick did not enter the
industry until 1871,” said Buer-
ger.

Stevens also said in his book

that “The power of the union Was
broken in the bloody and disas-
trous Homestead strike in 1892
by stern, brusque, autocratic Hen-
ry Clay Frick.” Mr. Buerger again
questioned the source of Mr. Stev-
ens’ facts and Mr. Stevens said
it was based on historical work
by a man named Fitch.

“After checking the reference
on the exact page Mr. Stevens
gave us we found that Fitch was
referring to a strike in 1889, not
the 1892 strike.

In another reference to Mr
Frick’s use of Pinkertons to break
the 1892 Homestead strike, Mr.
Stevens quotes from a Congres-
sional Investigation and says that
“from the start Frick was out to
stop the union.” Mr. Buerger
says that the “from the start”
was inserted by Mr. Stevens
without grammatical nottaion.
The report actually said that
once the strikers began creating
trouble that Mr. Frick stat-ed he
was determined to stop the union.
The ‘from the start’ part was
not in the report,” said Mr. Buer-
ger.

Mr. Buerger’s ﬁnal example
was another misquote by Stev-

ens. Stevens used a ‘governmen-
tal report which commented on
the poor conditions of the mines.
Buerger contends that upon check-
ing the source he found Stevens
had deleted the phrase “on the
rivers.” “This is important,” said
Buerger, “because the Frick mines
were inland.”
Mr. Buerger said that Mr. Stev-
ens has already agreed to retract
one statement made in the book.
The statement said that Mr Frick
belonged to a congregation which
included a number of people
whose wealth had not all “been
amassed in exact accord with
what many regarded as Chris-
tian principles and practices.”
Buerger summed up the de-
fense argument as contending
that Mr. Stevens is “substantial-
ly accurate” and that historians
need leeway. The case is now
pending in both courts and both
sides must ﬁle their summaries
and Mr. Buerger anticipates pres-
entation of the final oral argu-
ments about mid December in -.
