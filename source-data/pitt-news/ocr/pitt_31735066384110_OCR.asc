Oaklan_d’s ‘Ice Cream ‘Parlors

Bylt/IARKIIALE

Maybe it’s the recent on-
slaught of Indian summer that is
urging taste buds away from the old
October staples like candy apples
and Halloween bags ﬁlled with
Snickers bars and popcorn balls and
back to dripping double dip cones.

True ice cream addicts know
French vanilla is not limited to one
season; it is with this attitude that
this guide to Oakland’s ice cream
parlors is presented.

Abortion never has been a very
nice word. It has received a strong
stigma from many years of being
conﬁned to the realm of clandes-
tine, back-alley practitioners,
whose, medical supplies usually
consisted of coat hangers and
turpentine. Then, in 1973, the
United States Supreme Court
cleared the way for legal abortions
to be performed by competent
medical doctors.

Few unmarried women know
exactly what they want to do once
they find out they are pregnant.
This predicament is compounded if
they lack vital support and
compassion from their men and
their parents. Some repressive
parents add a burden of guilt on
their daughter for have become
pregnant, while at the same time
“forbidding” her to abort the
fetus. Some families would deem
that marriage with the man who
impregnated her is necessary. The
man, in this case, usually tries to
get the woman to the nearest
abortion clinic,
proposes marriage.

The crucial decision, despite the
many outside pressures she may be
subject to, must still be made by
the woman. Three choices are
available to her:

1) Carry through with her

' pregnancy, have the baby and keep

It.

2) Carry through with her
pregnancy, have the baby and put
it up for adoption.

3) Terminate
through abortion.

There they are, three choices
confronting the woman. The wrong
choice may cause misgivings.

Counseling for this problem is

the pregnancy

available at Planned Parenthood of 9
Pittsburgh. Birthright, Women’s

Health Center, Allegheny Wo
men's Center and Allegheny
Reproduction Health Center.

’ ‘P Free pregnancy testing is avail-

able at any of these agencies. If a

deserts her or-

women is two weeks late for her
menstrual period, she should
obtain a urine sample. The above
agencies stress that the sample
should be collected from the first
urination of the morning, and in a
very clean jar. to assure accurate
results.

Family doctors or personal
gynecologists also will perform
pregnancy testing. According to
Jeanne Clark, clinic coordinator for
Allegheny Women's Center, some
women are “so petriﬁed some
other people will find out, they
won't even tell their doctors.” The
fear factor, she explained, is part of
the reason some women come to
her agency for strictly confidential
pregnancy tests. Conﬁdentiality is
an important aspect of any of the
available agencies.

Should the urine analysis test
prove positive. pregnancy—related
counseling is advised at all ﬁve of
these agencies. This includes how
to tell one’s parents, smashing
fantasies the woman may have
about pregnancy and motherhood
and offering support for her and
her decision. As Clark said, “We
are as concerned about a woman’s
head as her body.”



Abortion,Alternatives in Pgh

Rita Cunningham, a board
member of Birthright, said, “We

offer nonjudgement counseling,
but we have a preference for her to
have a baby. Birthright also

sponsors a single mother's club on
Monday afternoons. We’re not an
abortion clinic.”

Planned Parenthood offers com-
plete counseling and services or
referrals for anything dealing with
human sexuality, including Pap
tests, urinalysis. breast examina-
tion, venereal disease detection,
voluntary sterilization and where
applicable, sickle cell detection.
These conﬁdential services fall
under its medical division. There is
also a ct unseling division and an
educational division.

The counseling division sponsors
a Teen Center Saturday in its
downtown center for those under
21.

“Young people bring their
friends, girlfriends, boyfriends and
sometimes parents” to the discus-
sions where “we talk about
emotional aspects, medical as-
spects, drugs, and sex,” said Dr.
Sam Cho Executive Director.

Planned Parenthood performs
early outpatient abortions using the
endometrial aspiration method.
Cho believes this is the “safest
procedure,” but it can only be
performed until the eighth week of
pregnancy.

Allegheny Reproduction Health
Center, Women’s Health Center
and Allegheny Women’s Center
will perform outpatient abortions
throughout the first trimester of
pregnancy (12 weeks), using the
vacuum aspiration method. Ac-
cording to Margie Gilﬁllan, Com-
munity Outreach Spokesman for
Allegheny Reproduction Health
Center, vacuum aspiration is “the
most commonly performed abor-
tion procedure.”

A vacuum aspiration abortion
can be had at any of these abortions
clinics for $150. The operation is

svered by the optional Pitt

surance policy.

Mary Ellen Tunney, Director of
Education for Women’s Health
Services, pointed out that her
agency, the largest of the three, is
“the only agency that has
consistently accepted medical as-
sistance patients.”

More Complications,

Women in the second trimester
of pregnancy are referred to Magee
Women’s Hospital for an inpatient
abortion. Hospitals have the right
to decide whether or not to perform
abortions, but Pennsylvania law
stipulates all second trimester
abortion patients must be hospital-
ized. Third trimester abortions are
illegal in the United States.

Spokesmen for Pittsburgh’s
three abortion clinics stress they
are pro-choice, offering prenatal,
gynecological and contraceptive
care.

AsGilfi1lan said, “We are

pro-choice, not pro-abortion.” ‘¢

‘Laserium’ Offers
Creative Arts

By PAMELA EUSI

Pitt News Staff Writer

Over three million people have
seen it, it’s red, green, blue and
yellow. It appears like clouds one
moment and snowﬂakes or concen-
tric circles the next.

If you're thinking that there's a
new UFO over Pittsburgh skies
lately either you could be right or

you could be hitting the happy

sauce, but in this case it’s neither.
The above description fits a new
form of entertainment called
Laserium.

Laserium consists of light forms
projected from a one-watt krypton
gas laser that is refracted into four
colors choreographed by the
laserist to the sounds of music
ranging form rock to classical.

The creator of Laserium is Ivan
Dryer who founded the company.
Laser Images Inc. in 1971 to
explore laser applications for the
entertainment industry. In Novem-
ber, 1973 he opened one of the
world’s first laser projection
systems at Griffith Observatory in
Los Angeles. Laserium began as an
experimental concert and in four
years it has spread across the
United States, first hitting the
major cities.

Laserium is an abstract form of
entertainment; what one obtains
from it depends to a large degree
on what one brings to it. Dryer was

Pitt Students Play

By LYNNE L. MEYERS

Today marked the beginning of
the Schenley Performing Arts
Series, a group of informal
Thursday noon recitals in the
Lower Lounge of Pitt’s Student
Union. These recitals are open to
all Pitt students. The concerts are
short, and informal enough to allow
the students to dress as they like
and bring lunch.

For the first program, pianist
and teacher Stephen Friedman
gave a preview of his recital, to be
given Nov. 1 at the Frick Fine Arts
Building. Assisting Mr. Friedman
were violinist Sylvia Arnett and
cellest Gail Czajkowski in Beetho-
van’s Trio in D Minor, subtitled the
“Ghost”trio because of its mysteri-
ous slow movement.

Because there was no printed
program, Friedman announced the
piece, explaining the reason for its
nickname and giving tempo mark-
ings for the movements.

Friedman seems to be a strong,
aggressive technician, whose po-
werful forearm action emits a great
amount of sound from the piano.
His style is well suited to the Lower
Lounge’s percussive piano, an
instrument with an overpoweringly
heavy bass register.

The first and third movements
were fast and hard-driven, charac-
teristic for Beethoven. But the
second movement, with its
“ghost" effects in the bass, failed
to make its mark because the piano
is difficult to play softly.

As for Friedman’s accompanist.

concerned with involving people
with ideas and feelings that are
bigger than and far beyond their
day to day concerns. He aimed to
entertain and stimulate and per-
haps inspire the viewer to states of
mind beyond his normal routine
making him richer for the
experience.

Ross Webb, who is the laserist
for the show at the Buhl
Planetarium was the understudy
for the laserist in Denver for two
and a half years before coming to
run the Pittsburgh operation.
Laserium is still playing to crowds
in Denver and Webb expects the
same to happen in this area. He
says the show will run as long as
people keep coming.

Webb sees his job as unusual——
there are only two laserists in
Pennsylvania. The laserist is a
“laser artist,” one who is in the
interface between the technology of
lasers and art, presenting them
together.

“It’s like playing. a musical
instrument only light instead of
sound comes out; it’s synthesizing
without a keyboard.” Webb said.
Hoedown (Emerson. Lake and
Palmer) was a fairly easy piece to
choreograph, you just go with the
rhythm and work the different
patterns.

“Classical music seems like it
would be easier to do but it is not. It
is trickier because it involves

Sylvia Arnett had slight intonation
problems, but played aggressively
and musically. while Gail Czajkow-
ski‘s tone was mellow but timid.
With a less percussivse piano and
pianist, Czajkowski would have had
a better chance to be heard.

Series concerts will occur every

tainment offered at B_ul1l Planetarium. The use of lasers

dealing not so much with the beat
as with transitions and making
them smooth and flowing. Rockhas
a steady beat where you can select
a pattern size and play on it.”

Webb can visualize Laserium
adjusting to any kind of music,
although he personally considers
rock music more fun to do. He
would enjoy performing “The 1812
Overture” where various battle
effects, from bombs bursting to
cannons exploding could be “laser-
ized."

Classics

Lounge. This series could offer a
good introduction to classical music
in a relaxed atmosphere. and would
be a perfect place for Pitt students
to meet.

An added attraction is that the
students can eat lunch while
enjoying fine, well-performed
music. It certainly beats hearing
rock blared through a loudspeaker
in a noisy cafeteria.

In fact, the laser effects would

probably add new vistas to music
concerts. Rock audiences have
accepted it as another alternative to
experience at a show as groups
such as the Electric Light Orches-
tra, Tangerine Dream, Pink Floyd
and Gary Wright employ the laser
while they perform. Webb agrees
with this new concept saying,
"Sight is as viable in art as sound

Other users for the laser have
been found in laser images for the
new “Star Trek" T.V. series, some
effects in the film “Damnation
Alley," concerts given combining
lasers and fireworkd and back-
ground for Shirley MacLaine to
dance to as was seen in her T.V.
special last spring.

Most people who become in-
volved with the techniques of laser
have background in many fields.
Dryer is a ﬁlmmaker, photograph-
er, astronomer and philosopher.
His keen interest in music and
technology influenced his creation
of laserium. To learn the craft
Webb mentioned the need for a
strong sense of rhythm and a

grow as a major additior_i_.o live entertainment.

technical background in electronics
and video synthesis.

“Anything can happen, it’s an
off-the-wall job. But, in my case, I
am enjoying what I’m doing and
making money at it. These things
don’t have to be mutally exclus-
ive.

The performance itself included
selections from Pink Floyd, Enter:
son, Lake and Palmer, “Neptune"
from “The Planets" by Gustav
Holst and “The Blue Danube" by
Johann Strauss. One's eyes beheld
a multitude of spirals, clouds,
darts, clusters and patterns that
reminded one of a children’s
design set called “Spirograph"
where equipped with different
colored pens, one proceeded to
draw squiggles and square pat-
terns.

Laserium is a profound exper-
ience. It is entertainment for
people of all ages, it is unusual in it
universal appeal. The only way to
describe it is that one feels like one
is living in deep space and at t9t.%"
peace with one's surroundings.
The show is contracted at Buhl
Planetarium until February.

Ronstadt’s ‘Simple Dreams’

Simple Dreams
Linda Ronstadt

Linda Ronstadt is probably the
top female vocalist in the country
and neither the Time magazine's
glossy treatment of her, her
rumored romances with everyone
from Mick Jagger to California
Governor Jerry Brown nor the hazy
Cocteau-like cover photography on
her latest album, “Simple
Dreams,” has altered the earthi-
ness of her appeal.

“Simple Dreams” is_a simple
album, but Ronstadt always focuses
on simplicity. No overproduced
orchestral arrangements, no

elaborate -background vocals or
overdubbing-she has always stuck
with the basics.

“Simple Dreams” is more like a
soad stop in Ronstadt’s career.
“Heart Like A Wheel,” Ronstadt’s
best work to date, marked a
changing point in her career;
“Simple Dreams” is a grabbag in
which no particular direction is
pursued. It seems Ronstadt will
take off on a new path in her next
album.

The highpoint of “Dreams” is
Ronstadt’s rendition of the Rolling
Stones’ classic “Tumbling Dice."

Her voice is roughly, raggedly‘

clear, the music understated and
sensuous.

The hype that always

patron to believe that this is “the

to a letdown.

“.lulia" is not like most movies

I today. There was a hype, but it did

‘rnot lead to the usual letdown.

“Julia" is supposed to be the
movie that signals a new treatment
of women, or at least a new

treatment of friendship and love
between two women. The love that

Lillian (Jane Fonda) has for Julia
(Vanessa Redgrave) is a deep
friendship; the sort that has been
ignored for so long by the ﬁlm
industry. V

Hollywood is always coming up
with new variations on the male
friendship—most recently with
Paul Newman and Robert Redford.
“Julia” is the ﬁlm to change that
pattern.

The" film is based on Lillian
Hellman’sauthobiographical
“Pentimento," a series of portraits
of people scattered throughout
Hellman’s life. Julia is one of those
people.

Hellman \was a budding play-
wright; Julia was her childhood
friend, who rebelled against her

A romantic attachment is depicted between Jane Fonda as Lillian Hellman and

Director Jack Smight has an
excellent ‘grasp on artistry and
adventure, as his newest ﬁlm,
“Damnation Alley, ” clearly shows.
But his failure to develop characters
and relation ships turns a movie with
concrete possibilites into an aver-
age action epic. '

The ﬁlm, currently running at the
Fulton Theater downtown, stars
Jan-Michael Vincent as Tanner, a
macho Air Force cast-off, and
George Peppard as Depton, his
authoritative ex-commander who,
with serviceman-turned artist Kee-

ﬁn (Paul Winﬁeld) and yes-man

’ rfy (Kip Niven), survive a World

War III atomic holeaust that has
knocked earth off its axis, causing
nature to go berserk.

The foursome board a Land
Master (a futuristic vehicle that is a
cross between a camper and a tank)
at their desert military base and
head toward Albany, New York, the
only place other civilization could
possibly exist.

Tremendous sandstorms, mutat-
ed creatures and unexpected
survivors stop the group along the

 arrow, radioactive-free path to

where Keegan confronts killer
cockraoches is vividly gerry and
squeamish, and all the explosion
scenes are breathtaking.

Art director William Cruse’s
artwork is superior—the electric
colors of the radioactive sky, the
murky shadows of the threatening
sandy, rocky landscape, and the
fantastic tumult of the earthquake
in Detroit really make the ﬁlm.

But the lack of .in-depth
characterization turns “Damnation
Alley” into an average movie.
What characterization there is
occurs in the opening scene, where
Denton tell naturally-free-spirited
Tanner that his careless abandon
bothers him and he should get a
transfer.

The lack of characterization
continues throughout the story;
what relationship the viewer
imagines between Tanner and
beautiful new-found survivor, Jan-
ice (Dominique Sanda) after he

aristocrastic family to ﬁght fascism
in Hitler’s Germany.

No other actresses could be so
close to perfection in these roles as
Fonda and Redgrave. Their

personal friendship off the screen .

transfers on to the screen, and it is
electricity between them that is the
strength of “Julia.”

Fonda’s portrayal of Hellman is
not realistic; Hellman was a crude
woman and even Fonda admits to
playing’ her as “more aesthetic"
than Hellman really is.

But that is not a fault. Fonda is
emotionally devastating in her
scenes with Redgrave. The two

create a pathos on ﬁlm no others
could come close to achieving.

The movie does have its faults.
The shallowness of Dashiell Ham-
mett’s (Jason Robards), love for 30
years, is a weak spot. Hammett was
in reality, Hellman’s model for
personal courage. In the movie, he
is not.

The scenes between Lillian
Hellman’s and Dash are not as
impressive as those between Julia
and Lillian, but that was Director
Fred Zinnemann’s choice. He may
have wanted Julia to serve the
function that Dash had in real life.

Lillian seems too politcally
innocent, which is another of the
ﬁlm’s faults. Her decision to run
money between London and Berlin
to help Julia and the anti-Fascists
group seems unlike the character

rescues her (via the motorcycle he
happened to bring along on the trip
to Albany, of course) is dissolved
because neither have another scene
together the rest of the ﬁlm.

And what mother-son relation-
ship one feels between Janice and
child—castoff Billy (Jackie Earle
Haley) in the mildly touching scene
of his discovery by the travelers is
ignored, dumped in favor of pure
adventure.

The acting suffices, although it
can be said in defense of the actors
that there isn’t much to Alan
Sharp's and Lukas Heller’s script.
The movie itself is enhanced by
Surround Sound, yet another
technique invented to involve the
viewer into the action more than a
normal ﬁlm could by surrounding
the audience with rumbles, explos-
ions and other vibrations.

“Damnation Alley” is a good
action ﬁlm—if your enjoyent is
purely adventure.

Vanessa Redgrave portrays the title role of Julia in the new film of the same
name. Her acting nicely complements Jane Fonda’s to help make the film a

welcome success.

Fonda creates. It is her love for
Julia, that makes her decide to carry
the money, a very dangerous move.

But that decision should have
been made because of her own
political activism and her political
beliefs. Zinnemann seems unaware
of Hellman’s own political life.

These faults, though, do little to
hurt the movie. The power of Fonda
and the graceful ability of Redgrave
are the main factors for the ﬁlm’s
success.

The most powerful scene in the
ﬁlm is a meeting of the two in a
small Berlin restaurant after Lillian
delivers the money. They discuss
the latest events in their lives-
Lillian has had a Broadway success,
Julia has had a baby.

Lillian and Julia will never see
each other again, but they cannot

fully express their feelings for each
other in the paranoid air of Nazi’
Germany. This causes a forced
casualness, as Lillian ﬁghts her
angry tears and Julia displays a
valedictory smile.

Their friendship is being sacri-
ﬁced before our eyes.

This scene—the power, the
tenderness, the strength——is what
the movie is about; the personal
courage of two women.

Courage of two different kinds.
Julia and Lillian personify courage
in different ways—but they both
personify courage.

Maybe “Julia” isn't “the
movie,” but it certainly is one of the
best movies of this year. ‘Fonda and
Redgrave turn in two of their best
performances to create a new image
of women in ﬁlm.

She also hits hard with an early
rocker, Buddy Holly’s “It’s So
Easy” and with John David
Souther’s “Simple Man, Simple
Dreams.” Both are traditional
Ronstadt material and her vocals
range from bouncing ebullience to
charging raw power. She does not
fare as well with the whining ballad
“Sorrow Lives Here,” an old Roy
Orbison song, and countrified
“Blue Bayou.” It seems as if
Ronstadt is retracing her musical
roots with “Simple Dreams,” and

untouched. However, she also
recorded two traditional American
folk songs, “I Never Will Marry’I
and the cowboy lament “Old
Paint.” Surprisingly, both work out
well, especially the latter, where
Ronstadt’s plaintive wail blends
perfectly with her strumming of a
lone acoustic guitar.

“Simple Dreams” conveys no

GratefulDRead's Best Hits 

By PHILIP SCALAMOGNA

The Grateful Dead
The Best Of The Grateful Dead
Warner Brothers

The Grateful Dead, who turned
progressive on their last album,
have released a collection of 18
Warner Bros. tracks (they are
presently on another label) on a
double album simply called “The
Best of The Grateful Dead.”

The subtitle, “What a Long,
Strange Trip lt’s Been” (taken from
the song “Truckin”), aptly describ-
es their musical career, which has
exhibited several styles of often-
mixed music: country-folk, rock
and blues. The album has only two
hard rockers—the remaining se-
lections are basically country-folk,
rock and blues.

The best cuts on the ﬁrst side are
the hits “Truckin” and “Black
Peter.” The latter is a slow, easy
blues piece. The lazy, heavy
sounding guitar adds to the mood of
the song. In the ballad “Cosmic
Charlie,” the vocals sound like
they’re slightly off key. The two
rock pieces on the album, “New,
New Minglewood Blues” and
“Born Cross-Eyed” are fair.

offstage, who also works for the
Eagles and Jackson Browne.

Ronstadt’s VOEE is awkward and
too ranging on some tracks. Loss of
control is a ﬁne device on more
emotional songs, but she does it too
much for credibility’s sake.

On the whole:~‘E‘VSiTmEple“ Dreams”
is a good album, but nothing more.
Hopefully, Ronstadt will make a
move towards different material in
her next album instead of remaining
stationary.

On the second side, “Ripple”
and “High Time” are nice
country-folk ballads, with decent
vocals. The country-rock piece
“Doin That Rag” is a good
all-around song, rhythmic and well
composed. “Dark Star” has some
rich vocal harmonies, all blended
nicely.

On the third side, “St. Stephen”
has a heavy blues sound, contribut-
ed to by the drawn-out guitar. “Me
And My Uncle,” an old ‘country
rocker, has lively guitar plucking.
It’s an example of the Dead’s ability
to put great spirit into their work,

both vocally and instrumentally.

The last cut on side three,
“Tennessee Jed,” is an easy
country ballad, ﬂowing nicely with
the beat like all good country music.
The vocals exhibit a nice draw], and
the piano really spices the song.

The fourth side of the album
continues the same sound,

“Cumberland Blues” is a lively .
piece, with enthusiastic vocals and a «T ’

vivd beat. Piano and guitar mix to
form an intriguing sound. In
“Playin In The Band,” the vocals
aren’t quite as good as in some of
the other cuts, but the rhythmic
guitar, organ and easy beat produce
an original sound.

The two remaining selections,
“Brown Eyed Woman” and
“Ramble On Rose” continue the
basic country-folk sound. The
former song progresses with case
both instrumentally and vocally,
and is one of the better cuts on the
album.

On the whole, the album is

rewarding to listen, to. Because alif,‘-F

the cuts have the same sound, it
becomes monotonous. But if Dead
fans want some of the Dead’s best
music in one package, this album
will satisfy them.

Ronstadt, Zappa
Two Varied Concerts

Frank Zappa and Linda Ronstadt,
two totally different personalities,
will be in Pittsburgh for concerts
early next month, Nov. 5 and 8.

Zappa, currently on a 100-city
tour, will perform twice at the
Stanley Theater, at 7:30 and 10 p‘.m.
His loud, pulsating progressive
style of rock will include the stage
antics he is known for, along with
his six-man band.

Now on the record label as
“Zappa Records,” he has just
released the album “Lather,”
which includes the single “Big Leg
Emma.”

Zappa last appeared in Pitts-
burgh in November 1976 at the
Syria Mosque.

Rodstadt, who will perform at the
Civic Arena Tuesday Nov. 8, 8 p.m.,

blends country, rock, pop and blues
in her music.

She began her recording career
with the Stone Poneys and started
her solo career in 1968. She has

released nine records, two of which&_-_

became platinum records.

“Simple Dreams,” her latest
release, contains the singles “Blue
Bayou” and “It’s so Easy.”
Ronstadt won, in 1976, the Grammy
Award for top vocalist and the Don
Kirshner Rock Music Award for
outstanding female vocalist.

What the Big Bowls Say About Pitt

How will the move of the Pitt-Penn State football
game to Nov. 26 affect the major bowl picture,
which will begin to develop Nov. 19 and which will,
Pitt prays, contain significant blue and gold -tones?

“They’ll wait,” said Pitt coach Jackie Sherrill,
hopeful the bowl selection committees will give his
team a chance to defeat a decent football team before
its credentials are finally reviewed. “If we continue
to win, they’ll wait until after that game to decide,”
he told reporters Tuesday.

“Not likely,” said Wilbur Evans, a member of the
Cotton Bowl’s team selection committee. “I frankly
doubt that we would wait, and I can’t see any of the
major bowls waiting past Nov. l9,” he said yesterday
by phone from his Dallas office.

Pitt and Penn State are high on the “wanted” lists
of each of the three major bowls-Orange, Sugar
and Cotton—to which independents may be invited.
Representatives of each bowl were, therefore, happy
to have everyone in Pittsburgh know how much the
Panthers are loved from Dallas to Miami.

“Certainly we regard Pittsburgh quite highly,”
said Caffery of the Sugar Bowl team selection com-
mittee yesterday. “They’re right among our first
group,” he continued, which includes, “according to
my personal judgement, Pitt, Penn State, Notre
Dame and the Big 10 runnerup.

“_We’ll have to look at how they achieve those
wins,” said Caffery, who strongly hinted that one-
loss-and-you’re-out is the game those schools will be
playing during the next three weeks. “If Pittsburgh

wins convincingly each week, and the other teams
have close calls...”

In Miami, which, according to the Orange Bowl’s
Bob Lafferty, “was fine until it got awful muggy the
past couple of days,” the Panthers are a passion for
the second straight year. “We wanted Pittsburgh

badly last year,” Lafferty, chairman of the team
selection committee, “we tried hard and were disap-
pointed when they chose not to come here.”

 

But there are no hard feelings, Lafferty was quick
to say. “Pittsburgh would bring a lot of people to
Miami and the school has had _some national atten-
tion,” he said. “It appears to me that if Pittsburgh
were to win the rest, it would go to a major bowl.
And I think Jackie Sherrill would love to come to the
Orange Bowl.” .

Evans of the.Cotton Bowl agreed Pitt is a conten-
der, but implied the new Pitt-Penn State date will not
help either team. “Remember, the Big 10 finishes its
season Nov. l9,” he said. “And that (the runnerup)
would be a team in which we would be interested.

But Pitt, Penn State, Notre Dame or Nebraska also
would be considered.”

That consideration will come Nov. 19, Evans said,
“Even if Pitt or Penn State looked to be the best
team at the time, we would probably not wait.

“We might just go for either team Nov. 19, gam-
bling on that last game. But with all the other
possibilities this year, I can’t see us waiting.”

Lafferty of the Orange Bowl had an interesting
idea. “We may just have to say, ‘Look, will you
guys (Pitt and Penn State) agree to having the winner
of your game come to Miami,’ or we may take Notre
Dame instead; I don’t know, but I don’t think we’d
wait.” 2

“I wouldn't rule that out for us, either,” said the
Sugar Bowl’s Callery. “We might go for a ‘winner-
take-all’ deal.

Another winner-take-all game could determine the
Orange’s host team. “The Oklahoma-Nebraska
game isn’t until the day after Thanksgiving,” Laffer-
ty said. “The team we pick may not know who it’s
going to play.”

Lafferty expressed what the others meant when he
said, half complaining, “They sure didn’t do us any
favors changing that game. It’ll make it
tougher...there may have to be some gambling done
Nov. l9.”

. W

Whether a big bowl is willing to gamble on a Pitt .

or Penn State that will have a large part of its hand
face-down, it appears, is something we’ll learn Nov.
19.

Hockey Sub-Committee Formed

By JIM PANE
. Pitt N.ews Staffwriter _
The University Athletic Commit-.

tee has appointed a sub-committee:
to study possible future funding for

'g{'£he Pitt Hockey Club.

The group, formed at Wednes-
day’s University Athletic Commit-
tee meeting, includes a student,
Athletic Director Cas Myslinski and
Executive Assistant to the Chancel-
lor Edward Bozik, will be responsi-
ble for "reviewing a proposal
‘submitted by hockey club president
Alex Sanchioli.

The .proposal calls for a
three-year trial period involving
joint funding by the Student
Government, which has been the
club’s sole means of support, and
the Athletic department. Accord-
ing to Sancioli, an athletic

department liason would be ap-

would

Sanchioli said the committee’s
decision, which could come within
the next few weeks, will play a
major role in the hockey club’s first
future existence since Student
Government will be unable to
continue its present funding policy.

“If their decision is no, the
hockey club will fold,” Sancioli
said. “Next year there may not be
a season.”

The club is presently surviving
on Student Government’s $8,000
and on player fees, which run up to
$700 per member annually accord-
ing to Sanchioli.

If the club proposal passes,

Student Government would allot
approximately $7,200 per year,
with slight annual increases, while
the athletic department would
contribute $87,000 over the three-
year period.

Carroll’s Hip Hurting

By KAREN KADILAK

- Pitt News Staff Writer

While teammate “Fast Freddie”
Jacobs jubilantly high-stepped into
the end zone with the tieing
touchdown with less than 10
minutes remaining in the game in
Pitt’s come-from-behind 28-21 win
over Syracuse Saturday at Pitt
Stadium, Panther offensive tackle
Matt Carroll lay face down near
midfield.

The 6-3, 255-pound tackle has
suffered, while blocking for Jacobs
on his 58-yard pass-run touchdown;

a hip injury that threatens to keep
him out of tomorrow’s game
between Pitt and Tulane at Pitt
Stadium.

“I was pass blocking,” Carroll
explained, ‘ ‘and I must have landed
on the outside of my hip. I got up
once and I fell right.back down. I
couldn’t move my leg. The pain was
terrific.” I

Lying face down, Carroll didn’t

know Jacobs scored on the play until
ﬁve minutes later when, stretched

out on the Panther bench, he took a -

glance at the scoreboard and saw
the score tied at 21-21.

“There were so many doctors and
trainers hovering around me that I
didn’t know what was happening,”
Carroll said. “I didn’t get a chance
to see the scoreboard right away.

“I didn’t even hear the fans
scream or anything, ” the Norwood,
Pa. native continued. “I was really
scared. At the time, I didn’t know
what was wrong with the leg.”

As quickly as the injury occurred,
the pain subsided, -— as Carroll
re-entered the Pitt lineup two
offensive series later and ﬁnished
the game.

“It was funny, Carroll said,
“but the pain sort of left after
awhile. I wanted to go back in.”

The injury has cast doubts on how 0

much, if any, Carroll can play
tomorrow. Mark May, a 6-5, 260
pound freshman, has been prac-
ticing with the first team offense for
most of the week and probably will
start tomorrow, although Carroll
may get the starting call if his
condition improves. '

“It all depends on how he's
feeling,” Pitt head coach Jackie
Sherrill said before a mid-week
practice. A

“He may start or _he may not see
the green turf at all,” offensive line
coach Don Boyce added. “If he does
start, he'll play the whole game.”

If he does play, Carroll hopes this
week’s game won't be as painful as
last week’s. He wants to stand up
and see some of the action for a
change.

UNIVERSITY PARK—Before
Penn State played West Virginia
last Saturday, Lion mach Joe
Patemo said three things about his
10th-ranked squad: it had practiced
well all week; it would play well
against the Mountaineers, and it
would score a lot of points.

Only the coaches and players
knew the validity of Paterno’s first
assertion.. But everyone who saw
the Nittany Lions whip West
Virginia knew Patemo was right on
the other two counts.

Penn State’s offense, defense
and even its special teams looked
impressive in the 49-28 victory that
extended the Lions’ winning streak
against West Virginia to 19 games.

The major case for concern before
the game was a shakey, inconsistent
pass defense. Just one week
before, State was rattled by a
329-yard passing effort by Syracuse
quarterback Bill Hurley. Things

' looked even bleaker when it was

revealed that Lion safety Gary
Petercuskie had suffered a shoulder
injury.

The Lions must have made some
adjustments in their pass defense
because they thoroughly frustrated
Mountaineer quarterback Dan

. Kendra nearly the entire afternoon.

Kendra threw for 222
But a closer look at the
statistics reveals taht Kendra
completed only 19-of46 passes and
was intercepted ﬁve times.

The precedent was set early in the
game when linemen Bruce Clark
and Joe Lally sacked Kendra for

large losses the ﬁrst two times he
faded back to pass. '

And when Kendra was able to get
the ball off, the Lions’ ball-hawking
secondary, led by Pete Harris and
Scott Hettinger, was there to
intercept or knock the ball away.

Harris replaced Petercuskie at
safety and looked particularly
impressive in his ﬁrst varsity start.
The 6-1, 197-pound brother of
Pittsburgh Steeler star Franco
Harris intercepted one pass and
made three unassisted tackles
before leaving the game in the
fourth quarter. ‘

“He’s a ﬁne athlete,” Paterno
said of the sophomore from Mt.
Holly, N.J. “We have conﬁdence in
him. And I think he played an
outstanding game.”

. Paterno said the 28 points given
up by the defense were rather
misleading.. .

“Defensively, we played a much
stronger game, even though 28
points looks as ifit’s alot of points,”
he said. “I think we played much
sounder and tougher than the score
would indicate.”

Offensively, the Lions were
effective for the second straight
week. Quarterback Chuck Fusina,
who appears certain to shatter all
passing and total offense records
before he graduates, was on target
again. Fusina hit on nine of 14
passes, including touchdown
strikes to Mickey Shuler and Scott
Fitzkee.

hard-driving style resulted in a
career-high rushing total of 105’
yards.

The play of the special teams
resulted in two big touchdowns, one
on Randy Sidler’s blocked punt and
the other on Jimmy Cefalo’s 57-yard
punt return.

“Our return game, both kickoffs
and punt returns, was ﬁne,”
Patemo said. “Our coverage game
has been good. The fact that we
were able to block a plum and score
a touchdown on a runback punt
indicates that there’s another
dimension to our football team.

“Overall, Ithought it was a very
ﬁne performance,” Paterno said.
“I hope that we can continue to get
better as we head down the home
stretch.” .

Down the home stretch—that’s a
key phrase. After the Lions tangle
with an on-again off-again Miami
team this weekend, they will face
North Carolina State, Temple and
Pittsburgh—and each team has
been a thorn in the Lions’ side the
past two seasons.

In order to beat those teams,
Penn State must
balanced offense, and -assert a
strong pass rush and run defense.
In addition, the pass defense must
continue the improvement it
showed against West Virginia.

If Penn State can play solid
football and avoid mistakes, it will
undoubtedly go bowling for- the
seventh consecutive season.

Pantherette Netters Defeat A

Robert Morris in Finale

By CINDY NATALI

The Pitt women’s tennis team
swept every match with Robert
Morris College last Tuesday to end
its season with a 9-0 victory.

The team wrapped up a winning
6-2 season, losing only to the
University of Maryland and lock
Haven.

“We were happy to ﬁnish the last
match undefeated,” assistant coach
Erma Pytka commented. “We were
optimistic about the match, but it’s
nice to win 9-0.”

Although Robert Morris did not
pose especially tough competition
for the Pantherettes, Pytka said its
ﬁrst three singles players “were
nice players.”

Pitt captured all of the singles
matches in straight sets. Jan
DeCostro defeated Ruth Ann
Gantos in ﬁrst singles, 6-3, 6-2.
Following up with wins were Janis
Irwin over Patty Dean, 6-2, 6-4, and
Pam Bachman, who downed Linda
Harold, 6-1, 6-2. _

Jan Brownstein beat Ellen
Langas, 6-0, 6-2, in the number
four position. Jennifer Mullan beat
Valerie Stunja, while freshman Lois
Moses captured her first victoryof
the season as she triumphed over
Lou Ann Sudarich. Both Mullan and
Moses held their opponents score-
less.

The doubles teams completed the
shutout. DeCostro and Bachman
split sets, but came back to win, 6-3,
3-6, 6-1.

In the second doubles, Irwin and
Browstein clinched a 6-2, 6-5, win

Winless Stickwomen Shellacked

By SUE MCFARLAND

Looking for their ﬁrst win of the
season, coach Janet McDowell and
her ﬂedgling women’s ﬁeld hockey
team took on Bucknell Oct. 21, only
to sustain their fourth defeat of the
year, ’ 7-1.

The game, for the most part, was
dominated / by the Bisons, as
demonstrated by their 28 shots at
goal and Pitt's eight. The Pan-
therettes’ only goal was scored in

_ the second half by right wing Gail

Karassik. Karassik, a freshman

-from Kingston, Pa., also holds the

title of leading team scorer with
three goals.

According to assistant coach
Louise Rick, several key factors
probed damaging to the Panther-
ette game effort.

“The team was tired and rushed
after the trip to Bucknell and didn’t
have sufﬁcient time to warm up,”
Rick noted. “As a result, our
varsity was slow and didn’t move
the ball.”

Rick also said the ﬁeld hockey
program at Pitt is young; it was
instituted into the women’s athletic
program in spring 1976. Due to the
late decision to add ﬁeld hockey to
the fall women’s sports schedule,
recruiting for the 1976 season was
poor, causing a shortage of

Pitt Harriers to Experience

Cross Country Championship

ByMARIASCIULLO

Pitt News Staff Writer

An [experienced team of Pitt
runners will compete tomorrow at

' . Bowilng Green University in the
a Central Collegiate Cross-Country

Championships.

Five of the seven-man squad
were part of last year’s seventh-
place team.

Seniors Mel Boyd and Dave
McDonald are naturals to lead the
Panthers against top runners from
Michigan and Penn State (co-favor-
ites overall), Western Michigan,
Bowling Green and Eastern Michi-
gan.

Boyd, who holds several Pitt
distance records, is one of five
competitiors with a good chance of

a winning ’- the individual champion-

ship. The ‘Panthers also will rely
upon Mark Studnicki, Tom Herr-
mann, Gary Siriano, Randy Bailey
and Bob Lee to better the l976
team’s standing.

Assistant coach Dan Sullivan

foresees his team possibly placing"

as high as third overall.

“Ideally, we’ll aim for a spot in
the top three teams.
Pitt’s number three through
number seven men will have to pack
tighter than they have all season.
We also will have to cut down the
time split signiﬁcantly for number
one through number ﬁve.”

“Boyd and McDonald should be
two of the top runners in the race, ’ ’
he said. “Everyone on the team is
ready for Saturday, becuase they
realize this is the biggest meet of
the season for us.”

To do 

experienced players on the 1977
roster. Of the 22 team members, 14
are freshmen and one is a senior,
supporting the theory that inexper-
ience is the key to the Pantherette
downfall.

Rickr also said the junior varsity
squad has compiled an impressive
record of three wins and one loss.
One of its outstanding perfor-
mances was agianst Bucknell, in
which freshmen Lori Kreider
scored the only goal of the game to

.of the top

a 1-0 shut out. Rick said the key to
success in the Bucknell game was
“The team worked well together
and moved the ball well.”

The Pantherettes will take to the
field again in an away game against
Lock Haven Oct. 31.

“Lock Haven is, regionally one
teams and has
experience in national competi-
tion,” Rick said. “But I think if
everything is clicking, we’ll give
them a good game.” -

Panthers Skyrocket to
16-13 Water Polo Win

By BOB LABRIOLA

, Pin News Staff‘ Writer

The Pitt water polo team, sparked
by the return of Butch Silva,
survived a furious Slippery Rock
rally and defeated the host Rockets,
16-13, in overtime Wednesday

— night.

The Panthers got off to a quick

start, scoring the ﬁrst ﬁve goals of
the match to take a 6-2 lead at the
end of the ﬁrst quarter. Two goals
by the Rockets constituted all the
second quarter scoring and Pitt led,
6-4, at the half.
‘ Midway through the fourth
period, with Pitt holding a 12-7 lead
following Luis Toro’s fourth goal,
Slippery Rock erupted. The Rockets
tallied ﬁve unanswered goals, the
ﬁnal one with just two seconds
remaining to send the match into
overtime. In water polo, overtime
consists of two three-minute
periods. A

The Panthers dominated the
overtime from the outset, as Silva,
Mike Mere and Barry Ford

‘ registered.,._the deciding goals to

insure the victory. Silva and Toto
paced the Panthers with four goals
apiece, Mere added three and
Machicote chipped in two.

The return of Silva was just in
time to counteract the loss of Dave
Diaz, who is out for the year with a
broken wrist. Phillip Ruiz, who
injured his hand at Indiana, will be

able to resume practice this
weekend.

Moses tied up Stunja and Sudarich,
6-1, 6-2.

The team carries its winning
record to Maryland today and
tomorrow for the Salisbury State
College Women’s Intercollegiate
Tennis Championship. About 53
singles players and 25 doubles
teams will represent 15 participa-
ting Eastern colleges.

Injuries will cause loss of points
for the team. DeCostro,
Bachman and Browstein fill the
singles positions for Pitt while
Moses and Mullan will be playing
doubles. Number-one singles
player Maria Paris will be one of
those missed.

“Maria deﬁnitely would have
been the number one seed,” said
coach Nancy Gordon. “Maria
recently defeated the player who is
seeded ﬁrst at the Eastern College
Tournament. She could have won
this tournament.”

Still hoping for a tournament win,
the Pantherettes are looking -to
DeCostro, who is seeded sixth.

There’s nobody there
couldn’t beat, if she plays well,”
Gordon declared. “Ithink she really
could make a name for herself.”
DeCostro has played well all
season, and holds a 7-1 record.

The freshman doubles team of
Moses and Mullan will clash with
the number two seed in their ﬁrst.
match. “It will be tough competi-
tion,” Pytka said, “but I feel they
will do well against them.”

‘Gordon admitted an incomplete
squad deﬁnitely will affect the
team’s point total, but she remains
optimistic.

“There’s nothing you can do 

about injuries,” she said. “our girls
are pretty tough and they’ll pull
through.”

Lose Three to

Robert Morris

By GARY ZOLYAK

Last Saturday the Pitt bowlirig
team traveled to Robert Morris
College, losing all three games and
falling below .500 for the ﬁrst time
this year.

In the ﬁrst game, the Panthers
consistently missed easy spares.
But they overcame these lapses
late in the game, and put on a
powerful surge. However, Pitt
came up short, 885-841. .

The second game, unfortunately,

started out like the ﬁrst, and aft? H
missed spares at the end resulte C 

in a close 826-812 loss.

Heading into the third game, the
Panthers were determined to win at
least one, but an early barrage of
strikes by the Robert Morris and
the loss of Panther consistency
resulted in a crushing 860-763.‘

B In summing up his team’s loss,
junior captain Geoff Joseph pointed
to his team’s lack of practice,
compared to other teams in the
division.
