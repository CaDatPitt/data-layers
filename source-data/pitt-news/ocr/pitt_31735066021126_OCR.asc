Staff Writer

When is a person not a person?

Russian emigre Yuri Druznikov
found out the hard way, and he
shared the answer with students
from Pitt and Carnegie Mellon
Thursday in Forbes Quad.

‘Druznikov was a respected
writer in the Soviet Union in
1977, when he made a speech at
a writer's, conference suggesting
that some of the legends sur-

rounding Soviet folk hero Pablic"

Marosov be re—examined.
In response to what he intend-
ed _to be an innocent suggestion,

When John Whitted, a full-time
Pitt junior, is billed for his tuition,
he is automatically charged with
an activities fee. The fee is man-

in the Soviet Union, Druznikov -

applied to emigrate to the Unit-
ed States. His status as a non-
pe_rson slowed this process, but
10 years later he was allowed to
leave the“ country.

Druznikov took advantage of
his long wait to launch what he

called a “police-like investiga--

tion” into the topic that had got-
ten him into so much trouble in
the first place: Soviet hero Pablic
Marosov. .

g " ‘Druznikov said that Soviets are
- ‘bombarded .with " propaganda

doesn't‘ like that, because he does
not know exactly who gets the
money or how it is spent.

’’I’m not sure how _much [the
fee] is,” John said. ’’I think it's set
aside for clubs and stuff. I just
don’t think it's fair.”

According to Student Activities
guidelines, 50 percent of the fee
goes to the Student Government
Board, 35 percent goes to the Pitt
Program Council, 8 percent to
the Pub|icatio’nsBoard and 7 per-
cent to the WPTS-FM Board of
Directors.

For one full-time CAS student,
the fee of $32 is divided like this:
$16 to SGB, $11.20 to PPC,
$2.56 to the Pub Board and
$2.24 to WPTS per semester. Stu-
dents in the College of General
Studies have their own govern-

concerning Marosov ”from kin-
dergarten to Crematorium." Ac-
cording to Soviet propaganda,
Marosov was 12 years old in
1932 when he turned his father

‘ in to the NKVD (the Soviet secret

police and forerunner to the
KGB) for crimes against the state.
Marosov was rewarded for this
action by the Soviet government,
but was later brutally murdered.
According to Soviet propaganda,
he was murdered by "kulaks/’g
rich peasants who opposed the
Soviet government's policy of
collectivization of agriculture.
Druznikov’s investigation last-
ed over 3‘/2 years and took him
to 11 different cities. His ex-

VOLUME EIGHTY-THREE,

‘Hand’ event aids handicapped  

ed stage shows. Pittsburgh Steel-
er Greg Lloyd, the Pirate Parrot
and the B-94 Bee, were also on
hand.

According to coordinators
Mike Lawless and Kathy Bost,
only minor changes have been
ihstituted in the festival from
1979 to the present day. To look
at 1979 from the present, the big-
gest change is that it’rs~much larg-

er and more widely publicized, ~

they explained.

Approximately 550 people
were involved in this year's fes-
tival, performing in a range of po-
sitions from one—on-one vol-
unteers, facilitators and booth or-
ganizers, to clowns and clean up

ment board and their own fee.

According to Terrence Milani,
associate director of Student Ac-
_tivities, students often complain
about the fee, claiming that they
do not use the services.‘ Milani
said, ”lt’s not a user's fee; it's
more like taxes. It's a cost of do-
ing business, and whether or not
you take advantage of it is your
choice.”

John lives off—campus and hard- I

ly ever attends campus activities.
’’I don't agree that it's like taxes.
I pay enough taxes," he said an-
grily. ’’I think they should estab-
lish club fees that everyone has
to pay if they want to be in-
volved, and the clubs should
raise their own money.”

Yvonne Barnes, a Pitt junior,
doesn't mind paying the activities
fee. Barnes said, ”You just pay
one fee and that's that. It-takes
care of everything. If people don't
take advantage of it, they're wast-
ing their money. It's not a bad tax
to pay." £

The fee not only provides ac-
tivities for the students but also

supports services and organiza-

and brother; witnessing the crush
of Soviet journalists who flooded
Marosov’s Siberian gravesite for
the 50th anniversary of his death;
and receiving lessons from a
former Russian agent on ”the
most efficient ways to kill a
person.” ‘

Druznikov found that most of
those who knew Marosov per-
sonally were reluctant totalk
about the details of his life, but
Druznikov eventually uncovered
several discrepancies between
the official Soviet version _of
Marosov’s life and what actually
happened. . 4

PLO denies reported Israeli compromise

-NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — A

. Palestine Liberation Organization

spokesman denied a report Sun-
day that the latest meeting of PLO
and U.S. officials included an
agreement to allow non-PLO
figures to negotiate with Israel.

The British weekly The Sunday
Times reported that during ‘the
meetings in Tunis last week the
PLO sanctioned talks between Is-
raeli government representatives
and Palestinians in the Israeli-
occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

The Palestinians, while not be-
ing PLO members, must be ap-
proved by the organization, The
Sunday Times reported.

The PLO agreed to
proposal with American assur-
ances that such contacts would
be a step toward formal peace
talks on the Palestinian question,
the report said.

”This report is baseless  and
this issue was not discussed in the
talks,” PLO spokesman Abdul
Rahman said in a statemegt fac-
similed by telephone from Cairo,
Egypt to The Associated Press.

The Sunday Times said Israeli

the

Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
will be presented with the
proposal when he visits Washing-

Bishop denounces
prejudice as sinful

CLEVELAND (AP) — In one of
his strongest messages on the is-
sue of racism in his nine years as
head of the Cleveland Catholic
Diocese, Bishop Anthony M. Pil-
la has denounced prejudice as a
sin.

”Racial prejudice, to put it
bluntly, is a sin against Christ's
message of love,” Pilla said in an
Easter Sunday message to
900,000 Catholics in the diocese.

Pilla asked pastors of the 251
churches in the diocese to make
his message available to anyone
who receives a church bulletin or
Easter mailing and asked priests
to refer to his message in their
Easter sermons.

The bishop's comments came
in the wake of several incidents
of racial violence in Cleveland,

Coping on campus

Finding a balance between aggression and assertion

How can I learn to stand up for
myself better without becoming
an overly aggressive person?

The issue you raise has ‘to do
with the difference between as-
sertiveness and aggressiveness.
Assertive behavior is self-
expressive, honest, firm, direct
and respectful of the rights of
others, while aggressiveness fol-

lows the same track, except that

it concerns personal? goals
achieved at the expense of others.

The nature of your question
suggests that there is probably not
much danger of your ever be-
coming excessively aggressive.
You can, however, learn to be-
come more assertive in your in-

teraction with others.
To accomplish this it will be

necessary for you to become.

perimental and more willing to
practice repeatedly new ways of
behaving. These are a few sug-
gestions for how to begin:

record incidents in which you
have acted assertively and those
in which you are displeased with
your interactions.

your problems in being assertive
occur all the time. —~

Soviet culture on the verge of commercialization ,

. By Jenifer Crook

I Staff Writer -

Culture in the Soviet Union is
becoming a commercialized in-
dustry, complete with traces of
sex, drugs and rock music, say
the leading American experts on
Soviet culture.

”New Soviet culture is
threatening the older, traditional
culture,” said Soviet culture ex-
perts Nancy Condee and
Vladimir Padunov in a speech

given Tuesday night at the
University of Pittsburgh's Gradu-
ate School of Public Health.

”Rock music, heavy metal,
punk, science fiction and even
comic strips about the Russian
Revolution account for a large
section of new Soviet culture,”
said Padunov.

The cultural emphasis in the
Soviet Union has shifted to the
Soviet youth. ”Now, to be young
in the Soviet Union is to be
sexy,” said Padunov, ”It used to

. be that under 40 was young in

the Soviet Union; now it's under
25."

Padunov said that since glas-
nost has come into effect, a great
emphasis in Soviet culture is
placed on sex and pornography.
”The new reality in the Soviet
Union is Playboy; the new reali-
ty is the Miss Moscow jiggle and
Twitch contest,” he said.

Soviet entertainment has also
become sexually oriented. ”Strip-
tease is ’in’ in Mosccm,” said

Padunov. ”For 200 rubles, or a
little over a month's salary, four
Soviets can watch a stripper bare
down to only a Russian Orthodox
cross around her neck.”
Condee said that because of
the release of previously cen-
sored literature in the last few

years, the Soviet Union has,

suffered from a ”cultural dump-
truck." She said that so much
literature of different types is be-
ing published that.a muddled,
confusing mixture is emerging.
”Imagine seeing a pornographic

centerfold in the middle of Time.

magazine,” said Condee. ”That
is what's happening to Soviet
literature."

Rock records are being
released in the Soviet Union at
the rate of two albums a month,
according to Padunov, and sever-
al older albums that were previ-
ously censored are also being
released.

Paul McCartney's latest album,
which was recorded in the Soviet
Union, is now being ”desperate-

41%

ly smuggled into the United
States for $250 a copy,” ‘said
Padunov.

Condee and Padunov also said
that open criticisms of the Soviet
government are heard all over the
country, and the subscription
rates_to Soviet newspapers have
greatly increased.

”Peoplé are turning toward the
mass media for truth,” -said
Condee. '

Condee and Padunov brought la

examples _to show the level of
commercialism that Soviet
products have reached. Among
the products shown was a distort-
ed face mask of former Premier

Engineers’ Week events planned

By Suzanne Sabol
Staff Writer

It's time to put away the calcu-
lators and close up the laborato-
ries. It's Engineers’ Week at the
University of Pittsburgh, when
engineers can take a well-
deserved break from their studies
and have some fun.

Engineers’ Week is a time of
”friendl competition between
0 1 u y a n c -
disciplines in engineering,” said
Engineers’ Week planning chair-
man Eric Jogun. The week con-
sists of games and activities,
inclijjding a celebrity-judged
para e. ‘

”It’s also a chance to show the
rest of the university what en-
gineers are like,” he said. ”We’re
active, and we do a lot for the
school.”

According to Jogun, this year
there will be more attractions
than ever for Engineers’ Week. In
addition to the traditional compe-
titions, there will be the display
of a solar—powered car from
General Motors. The demonstra-
tion of the SunRaycer will be held
on Thursday in.Benedum lobby.

The theme of Engineers’ Week .

oFeel

this year is black—and—white tele-
vision shows. Each department
chose a show, from The Munsters
to The Mickey Mouse Club, to
structure its activities around.

Jogun is very optimistic about
the week ahead. ’’I feel very con-
fident — it's going to be a good
week. We expect a lot of partici-
pation. It will be a good time for
everyone involved.”

One of the activities planned is
game night. ”|t’s'like a fair, or a
carnival in the engineering
school,” ‘said Vi Morgano, an in-
dustrial engineering student. ”Ev-
ery department has a room full of
games to play.” The games play
on the theme of the television
show chosen.

Also this week will be Gim-
mick, a series of games on the
Cathedral of'Learning lawn. Gim-
mick consists of tug—of—war con-
tests, three-legged races, an
obstacle course and a grapefruit-
passing contest. Each engineering
department sends representatives
to the games.

On Friday, the Engineers’
Week parade will take place. Ev-
ery department displays the float
that it has built _to reflect its

theme. The judges for the event
will include news anchorwoman
Sally _Wiggin, sportscaster Bill
Hillgrove and Pittsburgh Steeler
Rodney Carter. They will judge
not only the floats, but also a skit
which each group will put on in
front of the judges’ stand.

”The skits are great,” said
Sarah Cunningham, a junior civil
engineer. ”|t’s fun trying to teach
these guys dance steps the night
before the parade.”

Saturday is the day of the soap-
box derby. The race cars, built by
the departments, will run a
course down University Drive
that includes a ”death-defying
120-degree turn,” said senior in-
dustrial engineer Dave Rolnik.

As a grand finale, a formal en-
gineering ball will be held Satur-
day night. At the dance, the
points will be totaled for the
week and an overall winner will
be announced. The winning
department wins a trophy and
bragging rights for the rest of the
year. '

lieve they spend that much
money each year.”
According_to Milani, the total
amount isn't always spent. If

- there is money left over at the end

of the year, it goes to one of two
places. .
if the money left over was un-

allocated, it is transferred to the

next year to be used for emergen-
cy requests by organizations. Ac-
cording to the SGB Allocations
and Operations Manual for Cer-
tifi_ed Student Organizations,
emergency requests consist of all
deferred requests and requests
received after the budget dead-
line for the present term.

If the money was allocated to

Gan organization but was not

spent, it is placed in the Student
Activities Capital and Program

Reserve. According to Milani, the"

reserve account is used for
projects that the SGB may want
to fund, but that cannot necessar-
ily be confined to one semester.

”For instance,” Milani said.
”The SGB wanted to have a
sculpture erected, [and] the
money for that came out of the
reserve fund.” ,

The money funded a neon
sculpture that was put in the stu-

édent union for the Pitt bicenten-

 
 
    
  

nial in 1987. The sculpture was
voted on by the SGB as a gift for
the celebration. '

’’I don't think that's where the
money should be going,” John
said. ”Who decided on this fund,
and if it's supposed to be for the
students, why don't we get a say

My professional nursing career began at Shadyside
Hospital and has continued to grow here over the past
13 years. I came to Shadyside as an R.N. with one year
of nursing experience. As a diploma nursing school
graduate who was enrolled in Pitt’s R.N.-to-B.S.N. pro-
gram, I needed an institution which would support me
in my educational endeavors. The tuition reimbursement
was,’ of course, most helpful, but the support I received
from my co-worders on 3 Main made it possible.

After four years I moved into a nursing education po-
sition which opened an entirely new realm of possibli-
ties for me. The support of nursing management and
my co-workers in nursing education enabled me to de-
velop my potential as a teacher and a nursing leader.
I was able to enhance that formally through the Master
of Science in Nursing degree in nursing education at Pitt.

A nurturing Aenvironm,ent and the encouragement to
excell are criticalcomponents to professional growth. I
found both at Shadyside.— Catherine Mazzie Wisberger

American communisttries to dispute misconceptions

.By Patti Ellsworth
For The Pitt News

When the word communism is
heard, what often comes to mind
is oppression, bloody revolution-
aries and McCarthyism. Gus Hall,
general secretary of the American
Communist Party, said that one
misconception of the Communist
Party is that ”we represent a for-
eign power — such as the Soviet
Union.

”People mistakenly think we
are anti-democratic. We are the
most democratic organization in
the Uni-ted States, more
democratic than churches, more
democratic than trade unions.
Another misconception is that we
are anti—religious," he said.

Hall has been running for presi-
dent of the United States in each
election since 1972. But he did
not run in the last election be-
cause,/’states have made it more

difficult each state has rules on
who can run, which is ridiculous
because anybody should be able
to run.”

He said that the Communist
Party did not run in the last elec-
tion in protest of these rules.

Communist Party headquarters
are in an eight—s,tory building in
Manhattan. The party is involved
in such things as the peace move-
ment and the fight against racism.
The Communist Party does a ra-
dio talk show two or three days
a week and has been getting
some television coverage. ”We
are getting more press coverage
than in the past,” Hall said.

The party publishes a maga-
zine, Political Affairs, which dis-
cusses recent policy decisions. A
newspaper is also published, en-
titled the Daily Worker, nick-
named the official newspaper of
the Eastern Airline strikers.

Hall is involved in public

   
   

speaking, sometimes speaking at
college campuses. He spends
most of the day in meetings, in-
cluding delegates from around
the world when they come to the
United Nations. ”| most likely
know more prime ministers on a
first name basis than any other
American,” he said.
' The party's structure is broken
down into clubs, state organiza-
tions and neighborhood clubs. At
the National Convention,
delegates elect a National Coun-
cil and National Committee. The
National Committee is comprised
of 120 members who meet every
month and decide on policy.

Even though many members
have resigned because manage-
ment is ”rigid and strict,” Hall
says the atmosphere is ”not
repressive at all” but that the
American Communist Party
works to ”create an atmosphere
of freedom of expression.”

The American Communist
party does not believe in censor-
ship, but believes in ”guiding

principles; you must have some

a crowded theater.  I certainly
would not permit agitation 0

The typical member of the
American Communist Party. is
described by Hall as being a wor-
ker, although there are some
professionals such as doctors,
lawyers and clergymembers. The
American Communist Party has
the youngest membership of any
other political party.

-Although the official member-
ship can be listed at 20,000, Hall
explained that approximately
500,000 support the party. Some
support but do not join because
they feel that their personal ”at-
mosphere does not make them
feel free to join the Communist
Party.” ' A

He says that membership has
increased in the past few years
due to growth of the service in-
dustry. -

Party is funded by membership

As well as being involved in
national elections, the Com-
munist Party is involved in state
and local elections. It does best
in local elections. ’’[People] are
usually not elected to office as
communists, but on a much
broader slate," Hall said.‘

If the ideal situation for the
party occurredand Hall were
elected president of the United
States, he said he would immedi-
ately declare the problem of the
homeless, ”a national emergen-
cy” and would ”appropriate
money for massive housing con-
struction.”

He claims he would also make
protecting the environment and
”alleviating the threat of nuclear
war” top priorities.

"Hall described the Reagan ad-
ministration as being ”the worst
in history.” He said the homeless
are a Reagan legacy and that ra-
cism has increased under Rea-
gan. ”Reagan has cut off food
stamps and destroyed unions.
Wages have declined 16 percent.
The national debt has risen to 3
trillion dollars; we'll be forever
just paying off the interest.”

He is not much’ impressed with
the Bush administration either.
He said that Bush is raising in-
terest rates while an economic
crisis exists that Bush doesn't care
about. ”Better an economic cri-
sis now than at
[time]/’ he quipped.

Hall believes that the Soviets
have taken unilateral action and

responded on*anything.”
V Hall credited the Gorbachev
reforms as a ’’building of a more
democratic socialism.” He sees it
as a stepping stone in the direc-
tion of an ideal communist state.‘
He also sees the perestroika, or
decentralization of the economy,
as a step in the right direction. He
believes the future of com-
munism looks good in the Soviet
Union. ,
Hall has known his share of

‘ persecution. During the 19505 —
J the infamous McCarthy era-— he

was convicted of conspiracy to
teach and spent eight years in

A According to Gary Houston,
executive assistant for the Office
of the Vice President of Student
Affairs, the reserve fund is not an

A U S b U r‘ G e  O n ongoing fund. The fund was es-
’ I y tablished two years before the bi-

John thinks that leftover money
should be spent on something
more beneficial to students.
”What is that sculpture doing? I
think it's ugly. They should put
the money aside for scholarship"
or something. And if there's the
much money left over, then whj
don't they reduce the fee?”

While Yvonne Barnes didn”,
mind being charged with an ac-
tivities fee, she feels differently
about how the reserve is spent. ”|
always wondered where that

The Pitt baseball team is com-
ing off a not—so—successful
weekend at Georgetown, losing
three games.

”l’d have to say that the
weekend didn't go too well,” Pitt
Coach Bobby Lewis said. ”We
got some good pitching, but the
hitting wasn't up to snuff.”

In a doubleheader Thursday,
Pitt lost the first game 3-2 in ex-
tra innings and lost the second
8-1. Sophomore ‘Tim Gralewski
went the whole way for Pitt in the
first game.

”Tim did everything that we
asked of him in that game,”
Lewis said. ”We just didn't get
the hits when we needed them."

The nightcap was a different
story. Georgetown used power in
the early innings to jump to an
early lead and cruise to the
victory. -

Fre_shman Fred lriti started for
the Panthers, going 5‘/3 innings

before giving way to sophomore -

Desmond Schnur. lriti (who had
a 3.14 ERA on 14.3 innings com-
ing into the weekend) gave up 12
hits, seven runs and had one
strike out. Schnur (0.00'in two in-
nings) gave up one run on two
hits and compiled three strike
outs. . '

The Panthers lost the’ final

‘game of the series, 3-2, on a two-

run ninth inning *=Hoya rally.
Junior Doug Jackson pitched a
complete game. '

”That was a tough game to

lose,” Lewis said. _ ”We had
everything going for us, and then
they came back and won it. Doug
pitched a great game, but "gave up
too many hits in the ninth.”
There wasa bright spot on Pitt's
offensive side, though. T.J.

Colom,bo’s primary role was as

Colombo wasn't content just to

practice, sometimes to the dislike
of his teammates.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. —
All season long, starting in De-

‘cember against Shenandoah and
‘St. Leo, through the Big East

showdowns with Syracuse and
Seton Hall, on into the NCAA
tournament, ambitious oppo-
nents would drive the lane
against Georgetown and Alonzo
Mourning would swat their shots
away.

He was like some kind of giant

. goaltender, a freshman Gulliver

playing against overmatched Lil-\“
liputians, accumulating a school
record I60 blocked shots. '

   

And then on Sunday, with a Fi-
nal Four berth on the line, the Lil-
liputians got even.

Ninety-one seconds into the
game against Duke, Mourning re-
jected a shot by Christian Laett-
ner, No surprise there. What
happened next, however, was a
little different from what had
gone before.

Laettner, undaunted by Mourn-
ing, merely grabbed the ball and
went right back to the basket for
two points. Now Laettner, at
6-foot-I0, is no Lilliputian. He's
also no Mourning. But this was a
statement that the Blue Devils
would not be intimidated, not on
this day, not even by the fresh-

maintained

Hoyas to a 29-4 season.

Over and over, Duke went
right after Georgetown’s man in
the middle and discovered that
he was really merely mortal,
something -Big East opponents
had occasionally doubted.

Often they ventured into his
area only to find that Gulliver was
not there, sometimes left behind
in the transition game, sometimes
even lifted from_the lineup by
Coach John Thompson.

’’I wasn't into the game,”
Mourning would say later. ”I

Mourning.

And he dunked the basketball,
dunked it right over Gulliver in
the finest ”In your face!” tradition
of the schoolyard.

Duke's bench exploded with
the emotion of the shot and the
moment. ”I never saw a play like
that," said Quin Snyder, a little
bewildered by it all. 1, -

The workmanlike Henderson,
perhaps the least flamboyant

..player on the floor, said he
thought to himself, ”Hey, you
blocked five, six, seven of our
shots. This one, you're not gon-
na block.”

By then, Duke was sitting on a
lead and the dunk triggered a
15-5 run that put the Blue Devils
in charge. It also neutralized
Mourning, who spent long
stretches on the Georgetown
bench and wound up playing just
11 minutes and scoring just three
points in the second half.

”Alonzo appeared winded,
and I tried to" give him a lot of
breather-s,” Thompson said.
”They had a lot of their big peo-
ple popping out on the perimeter."

«wt-mm

Blue Devils victory nota time for -Mourning .

Alonzo is more of a goaltender.
And when we got behind, we
needed a smaller, more mobile
lineup.” 5

Georgetown was not done,
though. With Mourning on the
bench, the Hoyas cut the lead to
77-75. Then, with 2:29 to play,
Thompson returned his big man
to the game, an opportunity for
restitution.

The next time down the floor,
Mourning tried a hook shot. It ‘
missed, and Henderson rebound-
ed for the Lilliputians. A few mo-
ments later, Mourning was back
on the bench where he would
stay for the remainder of the
game. Even when Sam Jefferson
—~ not exactly smaller or more
mobile at 6-9 and 210 pounds —
fouled out of the game, Thomp-
son kept Mourning seated and
sent in John Turner.

. Mourning took the brunt of the
blame for his distinctly ordinary ’ 1
game. A

”I was a big reason why we
were behind in the final minutes,
and I was a big reason why we
lost,” he said. ”It wasn't my day."

But before you blame the big
guy, remember that he is just a
freshman and that without him,’ .
Georgetown would have been
gone from this tournament much
earlier, probably in the one-point
opener against Princeton.

NEW YORK —._Judge David
Doty has told the NFL Players As— V
sociation that he won't stop the 
new system of free agency under
which I30 players have changed
teams in the past six’ weeks.

But the federal judge presiding
over the antitrust sui_t filed by the
union at the.end of the 24-day"
strike in 1987 did not specifical-
ly validate the new system as a,

‘way for the league to satisfy anti-
trust "requirements. He didn't
mention that subject at all.-

I In a decision made public
Monday, the Minneapolis-based .
federal judge denied an injunc-
tion filedby the union of the
owners’ so-called ”Plan B.” ' ~

He based it on his ruling in July
1988, in which he held that out-
right free agency, which the un-
ion is seeking, could hurt
competitive balance and ’’would
work a wholesale subversion of
the Collective , bargaining
process.” _  '

”The court would have to
depart from its previous rulings in '
order to grant plaintiff's motion,”
Doty wrote. ”The court declines
to do so.” _

Under the new system, each
team was allowed to protect 37
players, with the others on the
roster to become unconditional _

_free agents, regardless of whether
they were under contract. '

Rangers get needed offensive help

By Michael A. Lutz

AP Sports Writer

PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. —
The Texas Rangers had no
problem in finding rationale for
obtaininglulio Franco and Rafael
Palmeiro to improve their
offense. .

Last season, the Rangers hit
fewer home runs (1 l2) and had
the most strikeouts (l ,O23) of any
American League team.

Texas became the first team
since California in 1966, '67, ’68
to record three consecutive
1,000-strikeout seasons.

The Rangers left more runners
on base than any-team in the
American League except Boston
and were third—from-last in runs
scored.

Rangers General Manager Tom
Grieve rested his case, obtaining
Franco from Cleveland for three
high profile players —— Pete
O'Brien, Oddibe McDowell and
Jerry Browne. A

Palmiero came from the Chica-
go Cubs, with pitchers Drew Hill
and Jamie Moyer, for Paul Kilgus,
Mitch Williams, Steve Wilson

and Curtis Wilkerson.

”We felt we had to make major
changes,” Grieve said.

Now Grieve hopes to reap the
benefits of having new pieces for
making the puzzling Rangers a
contender.

”l think it would have been a
lot worse and more nerve-
wracking coming into camp with
the same players we had last
year,” Grieve said. ”We enjoy
the opportunity to come to camp
this year and look at the new
faces and try to mold them into
a team.”

Palmeiro was instant offense
forthe Cubs in his first full major
league season last year. He was
second in the National League
with a .307 batting average and
41 doubles, and ranked third in
the league with 178 hits.

”At first I was disappointed,

about the trade because a young
player doesn't want to be going
anywhere,” Palmeiro said. ”You
want to stay and establish
yourself.

“But the Rangers wanted me
more than the Cubs did.”

The Rangers also showed him

offensive categories, including a

ELECTROLYSIS

a winning team.

“They also went out and got
Nolan Ryan, Buddy Bell and Ju-
lio,” he said. ”That showed me
they wanted to be a winner. As
a young player, you want to be
a part of that.”

The Rangers were shut out nine
times last season and lost 23 one-
run games, a statistic Palmeiro
hopes to improve on this season.

Palmeiro struck out only 34
times last season and had the sec-
ond—lowest strikeout ratio in the
National League.

straight season above .300. .
He wants to keep the string

going.

’’I don't think you ever learn
the whole thing about baseball,
hitting, running, catcher, throw-
ing,” Franco said. ’’It took pa-
tience for me to reach this point,
and I'm still_learning.”

Franco also liked seeing the
Rangers going for free agents.

“They are ‘signing ‘the free

Gymnasts beat Mountaineers, make NCAAS

 

By Jenna Hunter
Staff Writer

After a disappointing fifth-place
finish at the Eastern College Ath-
letic Conference tournament two
weeks ago, the Lady Panthers
turned in their best perfomance
of the season last Thursday night

I against West Virginia University.

Although WVU edged out the
women gymnasts, 184.75-
l84.45, head coach Debbie Yoh-
man was pleased with the fact
that her team's score was high
enough to earn a bid to the Na-
tional Collegiate Athletic Associ-

ation Eastern Regional meet April
1 at Penn State University.

Besides the team's efforts, Yoh-
man can also be proud of some
individual highlights at the
ECACs and the more recent
WVU meet.

At the ECACs, freshman Gina
Venezia surprised Yohman and
placed fourth all-around with a
36.65.

’’I was shocked,” Yohman said.
”She hasn't hit an all-around all
year because she always blew
bars.”

Venezia said she felt confident
about the meet and remained

WANTED

calm. -

”Actually, I took one event at
a time and got myself prepared
for each routine,” Venezia said.
’’I had a good, determined atti-
tude that I was going to do
good/’

Venezia added that toward the
end of the season, herconfidence
level got higher, enabling her to
hit all-around.

’’I improve as the season goes
on. I get more consistent,” she
said. ”By the end of the season,
I hit four for four events.”

Sophomore Jeannie Vecchio

tied for fourth place on bars with

A ‘THE, PITT NEWS, Tuesday, March 23, 1989

a‘ 9.4, and freshman Jen But-
kovich t_ied for second place on
vault with a score of 9.4.

The Pitt—West Virginia meet
also featured some strong in-
dividual routines. Butkovich
scored a. season—high all-around
of 36.9, placing third.

Vecchio and sophomore Carrie
Carnesale both won individual
events for Pitt. Vecchio scored
9.6’on the uneven parallel bars
with ”the best routine she's done
all year,” according to senior
teammate Trish Aser.

”She hit all her handstands; it
was definitely her best routine,”

Aser said. ’’If she iioes the same
routine and sticks her dismount,
she could go to Nationals again.”

Carnesale won the vaulting
event with a 9.45 . rid had a good
all-around perfoi “dance with a
36.85.

The Lady Panthers will travel to
Penn State this weekend for
NCAA Eastern Regionals. Going
-into the competition seeded
seventh, Yohman can only hope
for a meet like last Thursday's
against WVU and the score to go

_ along with it.

The women's basketball season
has been over for more than two
weeks now, and in that amount
of time Lady Panther head coach
Kirk Bruce and senior player Amy
Holman have had time to sit back
and think about whatvhappened
to a supposedly solid Pitt team in
the 1987-1988 season.

Pitt was‘ looked upon to be top-
notch contenders for the Big East
regular season title before play

. started, and they looked every bit

as good as those expectations
when they reeled off eight
straight victories after losing the
opening game of the season to
Eastern Kentucky in the Lady Pan-
ther Invitational.

At that point, however, ithings
began to take a dramatic turn in
Oakland. Indeed, after the next
game against West Virginia,
Bruce would never again see the

Pitt squad that looked like it was

ready to make a serious run at
East Coast supremacy.

”I’ve thought about it a lot,”
Bruce said with a laugh that in-
dicated frustration as much as hu-
mor. ”We thought we were going
pretty [well] up until New Year's,
and then we struggled from
there.” -

Once he took his squad into

Mountaineer country, they en— if

tered a tailspin that they seeming-
l_y could never right, partly due to
a disappointing loss and partial-
ly as a result of an injury to star
forward Lorri Johnson that
nagged her for the remainder of
the season.

”We kind of feel that had we
played a better game at West Vir-
ginia, it might have been the start
of something real big for us,” he
said. ”We should have beaten
them down at their place — we
gave them everything that they
could handle.

”Looking back, I really feel that
had we won that game, we
would have been able to go into
places in the Big East and have
the confidence to win.

, ’’Pl_us, Lorri injured her knee in ‘
the practice right before that

game, and that_sort of nagged at

Final Four teams represent best conferences

(AP) — Duke, Seton Hall, Il-

“ linois, Michigan.

An unlikely NCAA Final Four
from the three best basketball
conferences in America.

The games begin at the King-
dome in Seattle on Saturday, with
Seton Hall, 30-6, meeting Duke,
28-7, in a Big East-Atlantic Coast
Conference matchup that is a
precursor to a proposed regular-

season tournament matching the
East Coast's two top conferences.

Then, it will be the Big Ten vs.
the Big Ten, with Michigan, 28-7,
vs. Illinois, 31-4.

Duke, the nation's top-ranked

team for the first third of the sea-
son, is a 4‘/2-point favorite in the
first game, after reaching the Fi-
nal Four with an 85-77 victory
over Georgetown, the East's top

seed. The Blue Devils enter the
game with Danny Ferry, in his
third Final Four, wearing the
mantle that Danny Manning had
last year when he carried Kansas
to its upset national title.

”When you're ranked No.1 for
two months, that's a lot of pres-
sure,” Coach Mike Krzyzewski
said. - ’

But it's also pressure when a
team has not won a national title

and is playing a team like Seton

Hall, which is limiting opponents
to under 40 percent shooting in
the tournament.

The Pirates go 10 deep and
start two Olympians — Andrew
Gaze, Australia's best player, and
Ramon Ramos, starting center on
Puerto Rico's Olympic team.
Despite getting only six points
from leading scorerjohn Morton
and none from Ramos, the sec-
ond leading scorer, Seton Hall
beat Nevada—Las Vegas 84-61 in
the West Regional final.

The three other starters —
guards Gerald Greene and John

Morton and forward Daryll Walk-
er — are the result of Seton Hall's
past failures. They were grabbed
out of New York by coach P.J.
Carlesimo and away from St.
John's and Villanova after a 1-16
Big East. season three years ago
with the promise they would play
immediately rather than sit on the
bench.

”Us? In the Final Four? Can
you believe that?” Greene said.
”To think about where the pro-
gram was when Daryll, John and
I came here and to where it is
now.”

Michigan has the names, as in
All-American Glen Rice, who
shot 13-for-16 and finished with
32 points in the 102-65 rout of
Virginia in the Southeast Region-
al final — plus Rumeal Robinson,
Sean Higgins, Terry Mills, Loy
Vaught and a host of other high
school standouts.

But Steve Fisher?

”Never in my wildest dreams
did I think I'd be sitting before
you today as the head coach of

Michigan, with a group that's get-
ting ready to go to the Final
Four,” said the 47-year-old assis-
tant who got his job only two
days before the tournament
started.

Illinois must play under the
burden of its two wins over
Michigan, 96-84 at home and
89-73 on the road.

Coach Lou Henson recognizes
that, despite the euphoria of II-
linois’ first Final Four trip since
1952.

’’I suppose I could have pulled
off my sport coat and thrown it
and run around kissing people,”
he said. ”I really felt good. I think

A it's great that we're going to the

Final Four, but we still have bus-
iness to take care of.
”Michigan right now is playing
the best ball of anybody in the
NCAA,” he said/’I saw the game
yesterday, and they were un-
believable. They could have beat-
en a pro team. If they play like
they've been playing, nobody’s

going to beat them.”

process,” Colombo said.

And there are no hard feelings
about riding the bench. Even Pat
Cavanaugh, who walked onto the
team with Colombo and became
team captain this season as a
junior, remains a close'friend.

”Pat, and I roomed together. I
could see where he could see

said.

chanted ”Colombo, Colombo,"
in hopes of a basket by the bench

68-64 loss to Ball State in the first
round of the NCAA‘s.

Celtics rebound under
newly signed reserves

By Howard Ulman
AP Sports Writer

BOSTON — One day, Boston

Celtics’ fans figured, Larry Bird -

would be back. He would be the
man to turn around Boston's los-
ing season. Who would be a
more likely savior°

Would you believe Kelvin Up-
shaw, Ed Pinckney and Joe
Kleine?

You better.

Upshaw had been a guard with
Albany in the Continetal Basket-
ball Association, after being cut
by the Miami Heat in Janaury.
Pinckney and Kleine were substi-
tutes with the Sacramento Kings.

Instantly, they got the Celtics’
rolling as the stretch drive to the
NBA’s playoffs gained speed.

With the likelihood fading that

V Bird, who underwent surgery on

both heels Nov. 19, will return
this season, the newcomers on
the bench have become a source
ofhope for Celtics’ fans.

’’All three new people have fit
in very well,” Coach Jimmy
Rodgers said Monday. ”Often
times, when you bring a new guy
into a system, you wonder how
far you're going to have to back-

» track and wait for a guy just to be-

come familiar and feel

comfortable.

”All three, Kelvin, Eddie and
Joe, have caught on to every-
thing. That’s a big plus.”

Pinckney credited the veterans
with smoothing the transition.

”When we first came, Kevin
(McHale) and Robert (Parish) and
Dennis Johnson made it very
easy,” he said. ’’If something
goes wrong on the court, they
don't get all bent out of shape.
They just point you in the right
direction.”

The Celtics were 24-28 on Feb. :

23, the day they traded guard
Danny Ainge and forward Brad

forward, and Kleine, a backup
center they had needed for years.

could go 100 percent in practice
but not in games.”

The Lady Panthers went on to
close out the season with an
11-17 record (3-14 in Big East
play, including a 61-57 loss to
Georgetown in the preliminary
game of the conference tour-
nament).

”I don't think we were as bad

Obviously, Johnson was not
too hampered by the lame joint,
since she came on to finish the
year with a 24.2 points per game
average and 8.7 rebound per
game average.

The second-leading scorer was
guard Jennifer Shingler, who
poured in 11.9 points per contest.
No other Pitt player averaged
double figures per game, with

Connie Hurt being the closest

Lady Panther to hit that mark,
knotching a 9.3 ppg average.

liberal plan — one that would al-
low teams to protect 40, 42, or
44 players, depending on their
records.

But Doty noted that more than
1,000 players still were subject to
the compensation and right of
first refusal that has bound them
to their teams. The union is seek-
ing free agency for all players at
some point in their careers, a fact
of which Doty made mention
when he wrote:

”The new system is similar in
that the majority of NFL players
are subject to the same restraints
contained in the previous
system.”

For example, A|l—Pro defensive

end Bruce Smith of Buffalo, a pro-

tected player, was tendered a
$7.5 million, five-year contract
offer by Denver last Friday. As

with the old system, he will revert ,

back to the Bills ifthey decide by
Friday to match the offer; if not,
the Broncos will owe the Bills
two first-round draft choices.
Union officials were quick to
point out that Doty did nothing
to change the wording of last
year's decision, in which he
wrote at one point: ”The court

finds it probable that the players,

will prevail at trial and that at
least some of the players are like-
ly to sustain irreparable harm if
they are not immediately permit-
ted to sign with other NFL c|ubs.”

Doty’s new decision reprinted
that section, prompting Dick Ber-
thelsen, the union's general
counsel, to observe: ”This is bas-

ically a Xeroxof last year's -

ruling.”
The suit itself remains in limbo.

The Eighth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals will hear arguments the
week of May 8 on an NFL motion
on Doty’s ruling that his declara-
tion of a bargaining ”impasse"

I does away with the league's labor

antitrust exemption.

Management Council spokes-

A man John Jones said Monday that

if the court rules in the league's

favor, ”it invalidates the union's

case up to this point.” .

Both sides have said privately
that it will take a court decision

to get the two sidesback to the
bargaining. table. '

St. Louis wins in NIT Celtics

By Bill Barnard
AP Basketball Writer

NEW YORK — Monroe Doug-
lass scored 25 points, nearly dou-
ble his average, as St. Louis
moved within one victory of its
first National Invitation Tourna-
ment championship in 41 years,
by beating Michigan State 74-64
Monday night.

The Billikens, 27-9, will meet

, the winner of Monday night's
between St.
John's and Alabama-Birmingham,
in the NIT final on Wednesday.
St. Louis, which came back
from halftime deficits of 20 and
12 points, respectively, to defeat
New Mexico and Wisconsin in
the tournament, reversed that pat-
tern against Michigan State.
The Billikens, who won the
NIT in 1948 in one of their 13
previous appearances, opened a

5 34-15 lead with 3:52 left in the

first half, as Douglass scored 11
points and backcourt partner
Charles Newberry added eight.

Angels 2, Padres 1.

Glenn Hoffman's eighth-inning
single drove in Jack Howell and
snapped a 1-1 tie. Howell singled
Greg Booker, 0-2, and took sec-
ond on Mike Knapp's sacrifice
before Hoffman lined his single
to center.

Royals 5, Twins 4.
Bill Buckner singled in the win-
'9 ning run in the 11th after his
ninth-inning fielding error al-
lowed Minnesota to score twice,
tying the score at 4-4.

Willie Wilson led off the 11th
with a double offjuan Berenguer,
0-1, took third on Bill Pecota’s
sacrifice and scored on Buckner’s
single to right. ' I

Douglass, averaging 13.1 a
game, added 14 more in the sec-
ond half. Newberry, averaging
6.5, finished with 16, and Roland
Gray had 15.

Ken Redfield led Michigan
State, 18-14, with 21 points and
reserve guard Kirk Manns added
20, 16 in the second half. Steve
Smith, the Spartans’ leading
scorer who had a career-high 34
points in a quarterfinal victory
over Villanova, missed his first
eight shots and scored but two
points. ’

Michigan State came back to
score the final eight points of the
first half, closing the gap to 34-23
at halftime.

The Spartans cut further into
the St. Louis lead early in the se-
cond half. Manns hit a three-point
play and a jumper as Michigan
State cut the deficit to 41-35 with
13:53 left. I

Continued from page 15

Since then, they are 11-4. -

The Celtics were 29-30 on
March 9, the day they signed Up-
shaw after finding him playing
with the Patroons of the CBA.

Since then, they are 6-2. s»

The Celtics now are 35-32,
three games over .500 for the first
time this season. They are 1'/2
games behind Philadelphia,
where they play Tuesday night, in
the race for the seventh and next
to last playoff spot in the Eastern
Conference. The seventh-place
finisher probably will face New
York, rather than Detroit or
Cleveland, in the first round.

It seems unlikely that Bird, who
hasn't practiced with the Celtics
since March 9 because of swell-
ing and discomfort in his right
foot, will be ready for the
playoffs.

’’I guess hope is the word that
you have to use in that situation,”
Rodgers said. ”At this point in
time, nothing’s changed.”

Pirates upend lays
before sellout crowd

DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) ~ Bar-
ry Bonds hit a two—run homer
and John Smiley won for the
first time in four starts Monday
as the Pittsburgh‘Pirates beat
the Toronto Blue Jays 5-2.

Smiley, 1-0, gave up two
runs and five hits in six in-
nings. The only runs he al-
lowed came in the second on
Fred McGriff’s two-run homer,
his third homer this spring.

Bob Kipper and-Don Robin-
son finished with combined
three—hit relief, with Robinson
pitching the ninth for his third
save.

 

Ananoiiliifrounma
COMPANY

Mike Flanagan, 2-1, gave up _
three runs and four hits in six
innings.

Bonds’ homer, his third,
gave Pittsburgh a 3-2 lead in
the fifth. John Cangelosi hit an
RBI double off Jose Nunez in
the seventh and R.J. Reynolds,
the subject of trade rumors in-
volving Toronto, tripled in the

‘ninth off Duane Ward and

scored on Gary Redus’ single.

The crowd of 3,417, the
12th sellout in 13 home
games, raised Toronto's spring
attendance to a "club-record
44,019.

A foot injury that will sideline
McHale for the second straight
game Tuesday night and a wrist
problem that required surgery
and will keep guard Jim Paxson
out for the rest of the season,
make the roles of Pinckney,
Kleine and Upshaw more im-
portant.

With the Celtics, Pinckney,
who started Sunday in place of
McHale, is averaging 10.8 points,
Upshaw 8.0 and Kleine 6.4.

THE PITT NEWS, FASHION GUIDE Tuesday, March 28,198‘?

A voiding fashion faux pas are only an article away 

By Sandra Kramer
Staff Writer

As winter turns to spring, a
common question asked is
"\/Vhat should I wear?" or
"What's in for spring?" No
doubt, style is a reflection of you
as an individual. However, for
those of you who would like to
eliminate some "fashion mis-
takes" for s)ring of 1989, here

‘lhllll/A\\lllll llll

I

 

 

are (I few suggestions.

Women — according to maga-
zines such as Vogue and
Mar./emoise//e, the accent this
spring is on the midriff area. This
does not mean shirts cropped to
your bras, but if you've got a lit-
tle extra weight in the midriff
area, it might be a good idea not
to expose it. It's not flattering to
have your bare stomach hang
over our waistline.

  

Men —— Save the spandex for
work—out purposes only. Shiny,
skintight "biker shorts” should
not be worn as a bathing suit or
piece to an outfit. They're fine if
you're running and stop in
McDonald's for a bite to eat, just
don't wear them for a night
downtown.

_ Women — Remember that no
small is actually a size small.
Even if ou onl measure 4—feet

 

 

tall, your sweatshirts should not
fit. Fitted sweatshirts have been
out for years now. At least buy a
medium.

Men — Wait until it gets hot,
then break out the tanks. Tank
tops in 55 degree weather just
don't do it.

And for all of you who haven't
taken notice, don't shock us with
tube socks pulled up over your

York.

"The key to [being] a good
model is to look comfortable,
happy and to be relaxed in front
of the camera,” she said. ”You
have to give that image even if
you're starving or didn't get
enough sleep.”

Steve Dunn, model and recent
graduate from Pitt's dental
school, said that modeling "isn’t
hard at all.

"You go in and basically just
stand there and have them take
the picture. It's not that tough,”
he said. ”Sometimes you wonder

why they are taking your picture _

Q

6

when they could pull some guy 9

who's working in the building. I
don't consider myself better look-
ing than anybody else I've ever
seen.”

The models agree that the at-
mosphere during a photography *
session is relaxed but profession-
al. "The one thing they do de-
mand is that you're on time,” said
Dunn.

"’You don't go in_ there, ande

goof around. It's a very personal
relationship between a model
and a photographer,” Perrin said.
"You’re kind of exposing yourself
to this person.” i ‘
According to Docherty, the
average payment for modeling is
$75 an hour." Those models
represented by an agency give up

15 percent of that figure to fulfill a

a standard agency commission.
Docherty said that all models

she represents are intially inter— —

viewed by her agency and, if ac-
cepted, are told where to get
"head shots” taken.

_ ”We send them to cheaper
photographers to get them start-
ed, but-eventually they're going
to have to shoot with the more
expensive photographers," she
said. '

An average model invests ap-
proximately $25O in portfolio
photographs. The average price a
model must pay for a head shot
is about $100 dollars and $35 for
duplication.

Docherty and the models said
that this investment quickly pays
off.

Perrin said, "I’m being paid
full-time for a part-time job.”

”It has paid for my tuition,"
said Bouchneak. She added that
$75 an hour is "a small city rate.

"In Washington, D.C., Chica-

go and New York City, a model 5

is paid $1 50__an hour easily," she
said. 0

Steliotes said that the money he
has received from modeling ena-
bled him to fund a research

_ project which is now entered in

a national competition.

None of the models has
planned future full—time work.

”I would love it to be [full-Q,

time],” said Bouchneak. "But
there are so many beautiful peo-
ple out there.” ‘

.In with the old

Vintage fashion takes a page out of yesteryear

By Mindy Boffemmyer

Contributing Editor

As strange as it may seem, not
all students have a Kaufmann’s
charge or shop exclusively at The
Cap. Believe it or not...

Some students prefer a more
unusual look than that offered by
the large department stores. High
prices drive others to- shop
elsewhere.

An alternative is ”vintage”
clothing, which ”implies clothes
from the 19205 to the 19605,” ac-

cording to Stewart McLean of
Avalon Vintage Clothing in.

Oakland. _
McLean described vintage

clothing as “inexpensive, basic,

clothing —

I

natural
clothes.’

Vintage clothing provides an
alternative to moving ever for-
ward" through fashion’s annual
trends and phases. (Anyone who
owned something florescent a
few years ago might appreciate
the advantages of avoiding the
”trendy.”) Instead, vintage
clothes are pulled from the racks
of previous decades.

”When you come in here,”
says Richard Parsakian of Eons
Fashion Antique, ”you develop
your own trend.”

Eons Fashion Antique is locat-
ed at 5850 Elsworth St; in Shady-

SII'€€I

side, and like Avalon, it features
clothing that was in vogue prior

So, what vintage wear is in this
spring? At~Avalon, plaid shorts
from the '60s and short sleeve
camp shirts and button—downs
from the '50s and '60s seem to

are making an appearance again
in the '80s.

Your Pitt diploma is tucked
neatly under an empty case of
Budweiser. Your groggy head is
full of ideas and facts that you
have gained at the university.
And you're decked out in a T-
shirt and a ripped pair of jeans.

The diploma and the know—
ledge are good tools for entering
the work force, but the T-shirt and

ripped jeans will probably get V

you no more than a ”thank you,

we'll call if we need you.”
The solution —— assemble a var-

iety of clothes that can be worn

in combinations.

According to local clothing
merchants, the key to building a
fashionable wardrobe is‘to start
with a blazer or coat and expand
from there.

Michael
manager of Richmond Bros., said

that men should begin with a bas-

ic color: gray, navy or charcoal

when choosing a suit coat, citing
that they are the more conserva-
tive and accepted colors in the

work world.

the people are going to be wear-

ing into. As [you] are shopping,
a good ‘idea is to see how the
[mannequins in store windows]
are dressed,” he said.

The versatility of a wardrobe is
also important for a worker, Daly
explained.

”[People] should take into con-
sideration the quality of gar-
ments, and they should look for
natural fibers in wool,” he said,
adding that it is a good practice
to shop at stores which will do
tailoring‘, as opposed to ”cash
andcarry” outfits.

The recommended approach is
to purchase two or three suits
with oxford shirts and several ties.

On ties, Daly said that the most
popular styles are the small pais-
ley printed ties, as well as striped
silk ones.

It is also smart to collect two or
three pairs of shoes, preferably
with a shoe tree that will absorb
moisture and protect the shape of
the shoe. ’

For the young female execu-
tive, Betty Stern, the sportswear

— buyer at Price's, emphasizesthe

blazer as the cornerstone of a suc-
cessful wardrobe. '
She explained that navy i an
appropriate color for blazersjas
it will work well in all seasons.
”With that blazer,” she said,
”you could work around with
;kirts. You can get a striped skirt,
you can get a long skirt, you can
get a. plaid skirt'— with just that
you can get three or four outfits.”
Stern said that the color of
blousesxdepends on the season,

but that mild solids are a sound _'»

investment.
With a skirt, she advised that
women stay away from spiked

heels, and opt for the medium-

sized heel. _
With competition in the work-

ing sector stiffer than ever, it is ap— V

parent that to make it today,"
college graduates must not only
be able to play the part of a wor-

ker, they must also look the part. _

individualism, natural and

year's hair trends, according to
local hairstylists.

The ”unaltered and sprayed
look” is out, says Philip Pelu-
si. ”Something old, something
new,” is the way he describes
the trend in updated classic

hairstyles.
’’it is the ’non—chemical’
look,” states Carl Cimini of
Cimini Hair Design, while
Paula Mercurio of Pizazz Hair
Fashions says it is the time for
”straight, sleek hair, or soft,
carefree waves.”
Wild hair styles such as
punk styles are ‘all right, as
they are making a statement of
individuality, but for the vast
majority of people in the
mainstream, these’ styles are
difficult to manage. it can be
very annoying when you can-
not sleep because the stubbles
on your head are poking you.
This year's look is soft,
sophisticated and natural, in-
cluding light makeup for
women and a more ”daytime
look,” even at night.
' According to Cimini, ”Elec—
tric appliances, chemicals and
' precision haircutting is "out,
but more personal looks are
in. Precision haircuts are the
’70s.” The slightest nuance

can make or break the haircut.
l_Cimini stresses creativity and

soft are the key words for this

bid, new describe
spring hair styles

adds that creativity is Impor-
tant and is not up to the stylist
to determine. O

Length is not that important,
states Dan Kaminski of Hair
Accent. ”People are opting for
various lengths now more
than ever, but one should be
able to dress it up for evening
wear.”

Mercurio says that if the hair
is long, one length is preferred
over layers. if it is layered, long
layers are used to create
volume. For short hair, she ex-
plains, a bob is coming in
strong, cut close to the chin or
nape of the neck.

Pelusi says new versions of
classic cuts such as the flip and
the cap cut are back. Cap cuts
allow the hair to conform to

"the shape of the head _like a

cap and in turn, bring out em-
phasis on the eyes, especially
when a soft accent or wisp of
hair is left around the front.
The ”Mia Farrow” hair style,
popular in‘i965, is definitely
in, but shorter, sleeker and
more blunt —— cut off at the
nape with a side part behind
the ear. This style is best
described as feminine, yet
polished and controlled.
Pelusi says stylists are hav-
ing more fun with parts, using
straight lines as wellas jagged
cuts, too. There is also more
emphasis on the back of the
hair as a design element. The
back drops lower with a lot of

Modeling 4!

agencies
can be
deceiving

By Cindy O’Leary

Staff Writer

Unfortunately, there are model-
ing agencies that take advantage
of young, naive hopefuls looking
for a way to successfully break"
into the competitive world of
modeling. Not knowing what to
expect or what you are entitled’
to can give a prospective agent
the chance to take a client's
money without delivering what
was originally promised.

Evette Monell,‘ owner and
manager of Expertise Productions
and Model Management |nc., has 4
felt the negative effects of the bad
business practices scam opera-
tions depend upon to lure their
prospective clients. V ,

As an unsuspecting victim at .
age 12, Monell experienced_ the
letdown from a string of unful-
filled promises_and remembers
the damage done to her develop- .3
ing ego. . -~

As a result, she vowed that
when she opened her own agen-
cy, she would let clients, espe-

cially those who were young and

V inexperienced, know exactly
what they are entitled to receive.

Legitimate agencies are usual-’
ly not in competition with scam
agencies because each soon
builds up its own reputation and 3?
accumiullates "it's" '6Wri’”s"el€c'tféd T‘
clientele. ' ’ '

It is the scam_' operations which.
prey on the lessknovvledgeablie
clients.‘Once these agencies fail
to deliver what was promised, the
self-confidence of a‘ client * is
shattered. - _

Scam operations cause many
models with real potential to be-“
come discouraged enough «to
give up the pursuit of a modeling
career. A ‘ "

Mostimodeling agencies initi-,-
ate contact with an interested,_
client through an interview in
which the client's marketability
in certain areas is determined.
The appearance, personality and
confidence of the client are all
taken ‘into account. .

Contrary to what most people
may believe, most agencies stress
that the second two factors can
be considered almost more im-
portant than a striking appear-' ii
ance. A person must be flexible
and able to work well with
others. Attitude is also extremely
important because the model's
personality shows through in the
final product. .

When an interestedrclient has
gone through an initial consulta-
tion, a portfolio is assembled as
a standard procedure at most.
agencies. The cost for a portfolio
can range anywhere from-$110 '2
to $295 and up, depending on '
what type of photography is
selected by the client. Most agen-
cies will ask to see an 8-by-10
black and white head shot before '
they can begin referring a client '
to potential assignments.

properly acquainted with.stan- 4

volume and width.

Conditioning is more impor-
tant and is manufactured
E healthier than ever, as people
want healthier and shinier
hair. ”People are more aware
of maintaining hair and are
willing to pay more to do it,”
says Mercurio.

Hair should be thought of as
fabric, says Pelusi. ”The better
the quality of fabric, the better
something is going to look.”

In the area of coloring, all
I agree that rich colors with a
I shine are in. The color should

not be ”faded, ragged—out or
overbleached,” says Pelusi.

Mercurio emphasizes streaks
and soft highlights. Kaminski
stresses high and low lighting.

Perms are generally not as
popular as they were in earli-
er years, particularly tight, cur-
ly perms. However, support,
spiral, triangular, body and
spot perms are still hot. Pelusi
says that a spot perm on
straight to slightly wavy hair
”kicks itout” and gives hair
body. This aides the look, ena-
bling it to be styled more
quickly, and it looks better
longer.

Even though it is the same
look, the hair hasn't really
been altered, according to

Pelusi. The perming is under-
neath the hair, where it can
take four times as much chem-
ical treatment as the top.
Pelusi advises that it is im-
portant to determine what
condition your hair is in before
deciding on a certain hairstyle.
If people work with their hair
to enhance what they have,
they will get better results.
Much also depends on the
individual and the style of
clothes youiwill be wearing
and what styling aids you use
to achieve your desired effect.
The idea is to look glamorous
and at the same time spend a

little less on clothes.

Faux pas --

Continued from page 4
bras under white shirts are not
sexy. And as far as pants go, wear
solid, light-color_ed underwear
under your white pants or shorts.

Pitt doesn't need to know that '

you're wearing a pair of blue and

yellow polkadots. Save that pair ~

to wear under your stylish denim
shorts. .

By the way, anyone planning
on cutting his or her jeans to
achieve the denim shorts look,
please tame those fringes. Frayed
edges are better seen in Texas.
This also applies to the fringe

. shirts with the beads that you

I».
:70

bought as a souvenir of the beach
from the summer of 1984.
Probably the most common
combination is that of T-shirts and
shorts, but be sure that your T-
shirt fits. Don't let it pull across
your chest because it is too tight

' — not everyone knows CPR. And

remember, shiny decals are out.
Plus, they peel off after a few
washings.

So you bought a new polo
shirt? Don’t button it up to the
collar. Let yourself breathe. And
yes, even if your collar is up, your
neck can safely turn from side to
side. Avoid turning your whole
body in an effort to keep your
neck from knocking the collar
down. '

Men — When frequenting a

public swimming area, please

refrain from wearing Speedolbi—
kini swimwear. Do us a favor and
save the Speedos for the Big East
swimming and diving tourna-
ments. Speaking of swimming,
women, don't wear terrycloth
cover-ups. You lie on terrycloth,
you wear cotton.

Jams were once in and still
could be, but tone them down.
This spring is not calling for loud,
florescent Hawaiian scenes to
cover your body. So you still
have a pair? Throw a beach
theme party, and you'll be in
costume;

The other day I saw a girl wear-

. ing stirrup pants. Please! If you

0

must wearthem, cover the stir-
rups. This isn't horse country or
an English riding academy. No
stirrups for spring.

I know that matching is a con-
cern for us all. Perhaps the light-
ing in the dorms can be
deceiving, so ask a friend before

you walk outside in your navy‘

blue shorts and purple shirt.

It goes without saying that
fashion is indeed a reflection of
individuality, and I am confident
that Pitt will undoubtedly be ex-.

, posed to a variety of unique styles

this spring.

Make sure all possible options
are explained clearly and that
anything which is not fully under-

stood is discussed and resolved. -

Above all, realize that reputa-
ble agencies are in business to
promote their clients and to de-
velop and manage their careers.
Agencies that require hundreds of
dollars in upfront modeling fees
before securing a client work on
a legitimate assignment are bet-
ter avoided.

Blright colors and bold patterns
are the fashion call for swimwear

this summer, according to some ,

of Pittsburgh's department store
swimwear buyers.
’ ”There’s a lot of excitement out
there in swimwear this year,”
said Barb Welsh, swimwear buy-
er for the downtown Horne’s
department store. She said that
the most popular fashions this
year are ”bold and bright swim-
suits that make a statement.

”The basic tank suit is still very
popular,” said Welsh, who ad-
ded that it is a good investmen_t
because the suit can be worn as
an exercise suit as well as a
swimsuit. 1

Cynthia Homer, _s.wimwear
buyer for the downtown Kauf-
mann’s store, said that ”athletic-

‘style, cropped—top swimwear is

very popular.” She added that
metallic colors andlfloral prints
are also selling well.

In men's swimwear, the hottest ‘

look is nylon trunks in medium
lengths, said Mike Kallas, assis-
tant buyer for men's sportswear

at the downtown Kaufmann’s. He-Q?

said that nylon is popular be-
cause it is’ more functional and
dries fasterthan other materials.

”Volleyball has definitely had
an influence on men's swim-
Wear,” said Kallas. Volleyball-
style ”neon colors against black_
are in,” he said. Kallas added that
most nylon swim trunks have

matching jackets and shirts, a|—-

lowing the trunks to be worn as
part of a complete outfit.

The average price for a wom-
an's swimsuit this year is from
$40 to $50, while men's trunks

Welsh said that when selecting
a swimsuit, a customer should
’’really try them on. Take as-many
as you can into the dressing
room.” Many people only try on-
one or two suits, she said, but
”something that doesn't appeal to
someone on the rack often looks
terrific on. It just depends on the
person's shape and personal
preferences.”

Don't get upset if your normal

V dress size is a little too tight in

swimwear, said Welsh. ”The rule
of thumb in swimwear is go a full
size larger than your normal
size,” she said.

In cover-ups this year, said
Welsh, look for ”large, oversized
T-shirt styles that can be worn
both as a cover—up and a regular
top.”

The wardrobes of college stu-

casual, yet trendy. In order to
compete with this notion, Units

'at Fifth Avenue Place in Pitts-

burgh offers women a personal-
ized shopping experience that
'may be just what trendsetters are
looking for.

But why the name Units for a

isthe selection of brightly colored .

garments, ranging from the
brightest . pinks’ to the deepest,
darkest blues. Each piece of
clothing, whether it is a skirt, pair
of pants, top, jacket, or belt, is
neatly folded on the shelves built
into the store's walls.

f’lt’s a system ofdressing,” said
store manager Suelynn Merritts.
”Many of the pieces are multipur-

pose, allowing you to do a lot of ‘

different things. For instance, a
jacket can be worn as a jacket
one day; the next day it can be
worn as atop, and the next night
you may want to wear it turned

around backwards for an evening
look. . r —

”There are many different
things that you can do with many
different pieces,” she added.
”We have a lot of styles, enabling
you to" find.those that fit your
lifestyle and personality.”

, The initial visit to a Units store
is very personalized. Store con-
sultants show customers where to
find pieces to outfits in the store
and demonstrate how to mix and
match, creating many different
styles.

The pieces range in price be-
tween $20 and $40 on the aver-
age, and the interchanging of the

clothes and accessories allows
one to stay within a college stu-

dent's budget;

Although the clothes are de-
scribed as trendy, they are also

Unlike other vintage clothing
stores, Eons purchases its stock
from the Pittsburgh area, rather
than buying from dealers in New
York.

This is because theidealers’
”conception of what is really
good is different from what we

' sell here,” Parsakian said. ”It’s
just better quality.”

Parsakian and McLean agree
that the quality of vintage cloth-
ing is often better than that of the

. clothes currently being
manufactured.

prices low."

"There's the cost factor — here,
you pay less for better quality.

' And these clothes stay together,”
' Parsakian said. ”They’ve been

together for 20 years or more.”
Though their prices are slight-
ly higher, vintage stores also offer
an advantage over thrift stores.
”All of ourlclothes are cleaned,
ironed and repaired — not like a

thrift store where you don't know

what you're buying,” Parsakian
added. _

the used items having actually
