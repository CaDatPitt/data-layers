  Lope de   Vega

 

Verse Judged

By Midday Series Lecturer

By ROSITA WHITMAN
Lope de Vega was seen as “representing proﬁt
without honor” according to Professor. Allen S.
Trueblood of Brown University at the SU Midday
Series lecture on Wednesday, November 14.

“Lope de Vega as a Lyricist” underlined" True-
blood’s lecture as the second event in the quadri-
centennial celebration of de Vega’s birth. He out-
lined de Vega as the creator of ‘ »
the Spanish theatre, as a prac-
ticing dramatist and what is still
alive of his drama today.

“This is a proﬁcious opportun-
ity to examine Lope’s works with
his contempories and his aston-
ishing popularity during his own
day,” said Trueblood. Lope was
the undisputed leader of'_, the
Spanish stage for fifty’ years
while he wrote 1500 plays. Cer-
vantes, author of Don Quixote,
said that “good as Lope” because
parallel to the phrase as “good
as gold.” “Lope’s voice gave
meaning to the thoughts of the
past and gave it infinite articula-
tion,” declared Trueblood.

Trueblood Distinguished

Trueblood distinguished be-
tween the plot, range and techni-
que of Lope’s. plays. “Lope’s
plays presented in Madrid are
historical and legendary. His
characters are entirely legendary A
followed by folk heroes,” stated Trueblood. Lope
knew such ﬁgures would strike a responsive chord
in his audience.

His otheriplays reﬂect the days in which he

 

E was living. “His plays are like news reports —-

they were communicated so quickly. For ex-
ample, New Victory over Cordoba was published
and performed less than three weeks after the

- battle,” explained Trueblood.

“Lope’s religious plays runs a wide gamut and.
rests on a bedrock of religious unanimity,” contin-
ued Trueblood. Lope did not need to proselytyze

or debate, he needed only to dramatize values
taken for granted.
Lope Traditionalized

Lope had an affection for the countryside as he
caught the wheat song, May Day and Harvest time.
Any number of Lope’s ﬁnest plays grew out of a
wisp of popular tradition. Fuente Ovejuna shows

.particular clarity of the Spanish concert of valor

and the privileges of the different classes..“Lope
extends the concept of honor from
1 noble to common in this play,”
 commented Trueblood. g
Trueblood posed the question
what a. group of peasants can
do when their overlord under-
mines their legal ﬁghts. This
case against corruption side-
stepped the question of the guilt
of the peasants. “Marxist crit-
ics read this play with enthus-
iasm as the considerable solu-
tion for the proletariat,” grip-
ped Trueblood.

“Lope’s sword and manifold
plays reﬂect the character of Ma-
drid,” remarked Trueblood. Here
Lope draws an inexhaustible
combination. of‘ intrigue and ‘ hu-
man nature in Dog in a Manger.

The section of this play pro-
jects the indecisiveness and will-
fulness of a woman.

Quoted Pound

. in clarifying his ﬁnesse treat-
ment of women, “Lope is irrestible to women ‘he
knew the sex well as he married it ‘frequently
With Varying degrees of formality.”

T0 Clarify Lope’s place in the history of
drama, Lope disconcerts us ashe felt impelled
to have his say on every literary issue of the day
even if he did not_believe it to be true. Lope

Trueblood quoted Ezra‘ Pound,

seems to echo 6
Montaigne as
he refers to
his plays a

let} Face It

The University is constantly building, both here and
-at its subsidiary campuses, and is rightfully proud of its
physical growth projects. One important area of construc-
tion, however, is continually recognized but frustratingly
_' skipped when it comes down to the actual planning of the

educational plants of the future. This is the even—growing
problem of parking.

The parking problem is acknowledged by all who are
associated with the University, yet little is done about it.
Tightening parking regulations and increasing the number
of tags for illegal parking succeeds in p_unishing offenders
‘but still does not afford them a place in which to leave their
cars." ,

A The administration is now considering ways of attack-
ing the situation from the other end. Regulating who may
own a car, which is being done at other campuses, may al-
leviate the problem to some extent, but will still present a
variety of new ones, including a great deal of personal dis-
content among the students. / ‘

i It seems evident that only one solution is feasible. It
will be expensive and will possibly entail the use of some
valuable Oakland real estate, but the construction of a full-
scale parking garage is as necessary here as sunshine and
Carnegie Library. ‘

I Stolen In A ction

A student’s giant photograph of President Kennedy
which was on display in the Student Union, valued at fifty
dollars: Stolen. .

A television set which rested in a lounge in Salk Hall:
Stolen. .

Religious ikons, one a valuable antique, which had
decorated the Romanian and Russian “Nationality Rooms:
Stolen.

These pilfered items are the latest in a lengthy, sor-
rowful series of items which have disappeared from the
University grounds. Others have included valuable mer-
chandise from the Book Center, a painting by a renowned
artist which was on exhibit in the Student Union,‘ and ex-
pensive equipment from the Pitt Foto Club.

‘ These and other items are sorely missed by many on
campus. The thieves would certainly not be missed by any-
‘one from this campus.

Two’ on the Aisle . . .

Box Office lniustice

By Susanne Eckman

   

Last Friday night I saw the Canadian National
Ballet Company’s production of “Swan Lake.” It
was a beautiful interpretation, but my enjoyment
was marred by a sneaking suspicion that all the
beauty and grace on the stage
was accompanied by greed and
misrepresentation, and that many
lovers of'ballet had been kept
away. «

I sat on the main floor of the
Syria Mosque and as I looked
up at the audience before ‘the
show« I saw that all the side
seats, the cheaper ones, were
empty. I had been standing out-
side only a few minutes before,
and had heard the response to

 

requests for $2.95 seats: “I’m sorry, but only $4.95 '

tickets are available right now.” Happy-looking
couples had approached the ticket office, only to
turn away disappointed. Worse was a little girl in
a green coat who walked away with her father,
tears on her cheeks.

An older man standing nearby recounted that
a while before, a woman had come with six
children and ‘rather take them away disappointed,
had borrowed money to ﬁnance the rest of the 35-
dollar undertaking. The bystander accused the

manager ofgholding back the cheaper tickets sot

that the expensive ones’ would be sold ﬁrst. Only
after they were gone, he said, would four-dollar,
then three-dollar, and finally two-dollar seats “be
available.”

A Simple Trust .

I was reluctant to believe that his accusations
were true; it had always been much simpler to
trust in humanity, especially in enonomous insti-
tutions ’like box ofﬁces. But inside, looking at
the seating, I was forced" to change my opinion. .

- The ballet-lover who had commented to me had’
even gone so far as to call the police. They came,
but, upon hearing about the situation, only com-

mented that it is an old trick, but one that cannot
be easily defended against. As long as even a
very few of the more inexpensive tickets are sold,
advertising a wide variety of prices is within the
law, even if not ethically admirable.

I had known that price—jacking'is common in

some areas, but was astounded that something so
‘akin to it can be found in the Oakland area, the
"so-called cultural center of the city. The majority

of people, of course, give in and buy expensive
seats after having planned the evening and gone
to the trouble‘ of_ going out’.
Less than Spectacular
Incidents of this sort are not in themselves
earth-shaking. "Perhaps someone not particularly
interested in the performances, or not particularly
broke, would call them trivial. But to a couple
bound for an evening’s enjoyment it is a disap-
pointment, and to a. child who dreams of being a
ballerina’ it can be a tragedy.
' Even more,/it shows the unconcern with which
people greet minor injustices. To those who can

_ afford to pay the extra cost it isa minor inconven-

ience, and to those who can’t,, it is, “just too bad.”

The: futility of protest to a “minor injustice”
such as this is readily apparent. The police can do
little, and even if they could accomplish some-
thing. it would take too much time and manpower
— and there are much larger wrongs to be right-
ed.

The Better Business Bureau seems to be in-
effective in combating this type of fraud, and
public opinion cannot be drawn to such, a small
item. And in the meantime, whoever is proﬁting
by unfair tactics continues to proﬁt, with impunity.

I don’t know exactly what can be done, but/it
seems to me that by letting the “little things” go
unquestioned, we are opening ourselves to accept-
ing larger and larger “things” without protest,
until. perhaps, someday, we will only be able to

. accept.

Pot of Boredom . . 

\

Face In The Crowd

By Ed Roberson.

Unless a party levitated clinking in its mix at
least a ﬂoor above the tars and elevator machinery
of the roof, the "hotel had more than twenty-ﬁve
ﬂoors, because he had been at parties on. twenty-
four of them, and had, met the —'
morning on the stairs going up a
ﬂight from where—ever he,had~
ended the night.

He introduced the. bright
thing to the night’s recollections
as he slippered downAthe deep-
carpeted hall. They“ were a
three—hour-old invitation to join
some march, that tepid broth of
ice that is. the cadaver of a
drink, and all the extrafeet that
were gained withuthe hours and ,
that kept sliding through and over his next elec-
tric step. i , l '

At breakfast he heard about how efficiently he
had lugged his out-sized roommate upstairs into
bed, and then, “Hey, you don’t.dririk do you —
you were sober as hell last night. That’s not going
tonight, buddy. There’s a party in . . .”

“In tomato juice, that’s what I’ll bathe in, thick
clotty corpulent slugs of cool tomato jui——-. Sure,
sure, I’ll be there.” _

By the end of the week he had also~heard that
she — whoever she was —- was sure Pittsburgh was
a swingin’ town because of the uninhibited way he
danced, and that he was the most solemn Yankee
at the convention. Perhaps it was out of his sol-
enmity that he never told her that he was merely
obscene.

Not Obdurate

Yet he was not obdurate enough to squelch the
egregious irony of the over-serious subjects an-
nealed to the tongues of those harder faces cooling
on the parties‘ edges. It was times like this that
the numbness was not a bad thing. It masqueraded
as both a taciturn yet aroused concern and again
as a shield or a wall behind which the fragile birds
of solitude had their wild reservation.

But even here, the numbness itself, was work-

 

‘ ._ing to null even that loeyondvits, own distinctions?

I ‘It _ itigon, it__s_ _bii b‘ ow

down to almost nothing for the shield to defend,
until-even the relevant court of indifference could
not communicate the. dictation of his next act.

So not being able any longer to get either mask
or protection or even escape within his numbness,
he sidled the remains of his inattention between the
talkers’ words and out", of the conversations.

All week when people came asking politely
where he was from, he would_ catch himself not
being careful about answering either, -“I don’t like
to think about that,” or “East Ji—B1ip, I’m an ex-
change student,” the, sarcastic numbness again
playing the punchy strings of wit.

Unlie Wif ~

But there was a difference. Unlike wit these
sharp performances always left unresolved the
question of why and from where the acidic incon-
stancy springs; they never had the closeness, the
reality that humor backhandedlyldraws afterlitself.
And as deep as the pots of boredom may be, there
is never that excess of itself that can be smeared
into any less painfulmasque of itself.

He remembered that there was a ritual to in-
difference, there was a responsibility against a par-
ticular thing which one did not attend] But his
loss, his veto of connection was neither action nor
retaliation. He couldn’t be aware that he did not
want or care to applaud the band, he just didn’t.

And when that speaker who comes with the extra

coffee was sugaring into everyone’s senses . . .

He stole the ﬂowers from the center piece on
the table, the straw basket that sank in to the linen
it was so thick. He took an orange and a’ yellow
because people were looking; otherwise he woujd
have taken only an orange. On the way to the
elevator he reasoned that flowers must mean some-
thing if he had been moved to save them from deft-
ﬁngered cleaning ladies. The elevator operator was
amazed. Chrysanthemums in a lapel _ . ,

When he threw them into the (.‘l‘1i11-1y. night he
watched them ﬂoat down at least ten floors towards
the white tops of the harried buses. But before
the.Y’d land in any elevator operator’s hair=-the-v-xviiid
would wing them between the gully buildings like
P1880118 -— or, like pigeons ‘look from a,~,tL,w.en'iy..

IIF Council I Discusses“ Activity

Questionnaire,

At last Wednesday’s IF meeting,

Life Insurance

Vice—President Mark

Bebko announced the publication of an activities question-
iare to be ﬁlled in by every fraternity member.
“The purpose of the form,” stated Bebko, ‘-‘islto deter-

mine what the fraternity men on this campus are” doing _in
activities and scholastics.”_ Frat men will be asked what

positions they have held now or‘

at any time while at the Uni-
versity, in campus organizations.
QPAs from freshman to senior
years will also be asked for. I

The questionnaire will ‘also ask
for information concerning any
jobs held by the men and their
eﬁect upon QPAs.

Forms Distributed
The form will be taken to each

.. fraternity for the members to ﬁll

in. Bebko will then compile and
evaluate the results.

IF Treasurer Lou Fox in-
formed members of the receipt
of a tentative insurance policy
sent to ‘the Council for their
reaction. ‘

The. policy, issued by Highamy
Neilson, Whitridge and Reid, Inc.,
the company which issues _the
University’s present Medical Plan,
have been sent to various other
colleges including Penn State,
Muhlenburg and University of
Virginia for appraisal.

IF Asked

IF has been asked, as a rep-
resentative of the student body
and a major organization on cam-
pus, to write the company a let-
ter stating their reaction to the

' policy.

Although‘ the members of IF
were generally favorable to the
policy, they desire further.infor-
mation and insurance major Joe
Lehmann has been delegated to
study the proposal thoroughly.

Valuable Ikons
Disappear From

Nationality Rooms

Ruth Crawford Mitchell, Direc-
tor Emeritus of the Nationality
Rooms Program, in a letter to
The Pitt News asked for student
co.-operation in obtaining the re-
turn of three ikons missing from
the Romanian and Russian Class-
rooms since October 25.

A security officer discovered the
theft of the two‘ Romanian ikons
at 10:45 p,r'n. on October 25. The
Russian ikon was reported miss-
ing by a Student Hostess at 3:00
p.m. on October 26. Ikons are
bas relief, or moasic representa-
tions of the saints.

The Russian ikon “Our Lady of
Vladimir” is the only original sev-
enteenth century piece in the
Russian Classroom. All three
ikons are irreplaceable.

Security Overdue

“Tightening o f S e c u r i t y
throughout the University is
known to be long overdue,” said
Ruth Mitchell, “but in the con-
tinuing disappearance of decora-
tive articles from the Nationality
Rooms, the University Admini-
stration and the Nationality Room
Committees are confronted with
the necessity for some practical
decisions.”

One choice might possibly be
the locking of the Nationality
Rooms when not in use for class

or stripping, them of their deco-
rative features.

Holiday Service

munity will be held tomorrow

The Salvation Army, a Prot-

broke off from the English
Methodist church about 150
years ago. The Methodist
church was compised of middle

the Salvation Army church was
supported by the poorer classes
who sought to help others in
time of depression. Today this
“army of God”-still has this
two-fold purpose—help for the
needy and its function as a

COMMITTEES:
AN AGONIZING RE-APPRAISAL

To those of you who stay out of your student government .
because you believe the committee system is just an excuse
for. inaction, let me cite an example to prove that a committee,
properly led and directed, can be a great force for good.
Lastweek the Student Council met at the Duluth College
" of Veterinary Medicine and Belles Lettres to discuss purchasing _
a new doormat for the students union. It was, I assure you, a
desperate problem because Sherwin K. Sigafoos, janitor of the
students union, threatened ﬂatly to quit unless a new doormat
was installed immediately. “I’in sick and tired of mopping that *
dirty old ﬂoor,” said Mr. Sigafoos, sobbing convulsively. (Mr. ‘
Sigafoos, once a jolly outgoing sort, has been crying almost ~
steadily since the recent death of his pet wart hog who had
been his constant companion for 22 years. Actually, Mr. Sigafoos
is much better off, without the wart hog, who tusked him
viciously at least once a day, but a companionship of 22 years
is, I suppose, not lightly relinquished. The college tried to give
Mr. Sigafoos a new Wart hog-

a frisky little fellow with ﬂoppy

ears and a waggly tai1—but Mr. Sigafoos only turned his back
and cried the harder.)

-4f~74@r’0,@¢’ -

dtaér

But I digress. The Student Council met, discussed the door-
mat for eight or ten hours, and then referred it to a committee.
There were some who scoffed then and said nothing would
ever be heard of the doormat again, but they reckoned without

Invictus Millstone, chairman of the doormat committee,
was a man of action——lithe and lean and keen and, nzitnrally, a
smoker of Marlboro Cigarettes. Why do I say “n:itm'ally”?
Because, dear friends, active men and women don’t have time
to brood and bumble about their cigarett-es. They need to be
certain. They must have perfect confidence that each time they
light ‘up they will get the) same gratifying ﬂavor, the smne
Selectrate ﬁlter, the same soft soft-pack, the same flip top
ﬂip-top box. In brief, dear friends, they need to be sure it’s
Marlboro—for if ever a smoke was true and trusty, it’s Marlboro.
Get some soon. Get matches too, because true and trusty
though Marlboros are, your pleasure will be somewhat limited

, Well sir, Invictus Millstone chaired his doormat committee
with such vigor and dispatch that when the Student Council
met only one week later, he was able to rise and deliver the

1. That the college ‘build new schools of botany, hydraulic 0
engineering, tropical medicine, Indo—Germ‘anic languages, and

2. That the college drop football, put a roof on the stadium.
and turn it into a low-cost housing project for niarried students.
3. That the college raise faculty salaries by $5000 per year

4. That the college secede from the United States.
5. That the question of a doormat for the students union

So let us hear no» more defeatist talk about the committee

JUSTICE, ETC.‘

NEW YORK .— The closely-knit Panther football team
carried their favorite coach, John Michelosen, off the Yankee
Stadium ﬁeld atop their broad shoulders.

Back home some enterprising souls were lynching a
stuffed effigy of O’B, holding a prized copy of The Pitt News.
The flag wassent up late Saturday night. I’m not the first
man in American history who was. hung for telling the

~ truth.

=1= =l= * *

If Coach PaukDietzel of Army is such achild-genius how
come his team only-attempted nine passes against Pitt’s
pseudo-pass defense? The week before, Notre Dame did what
seemed logical all year_t_o do —— just keep throwing_— and

they completed 20 passes.’ Bill Barnes of UCLA pulled the

same boner at the Stadium earlier.

What Price Scouting? 

Army has beenscouting Pittfor six games with a minia-
ture corps of assistant coaches. We’d like to know what
price scouting? They certainly didn’t learn anything.

So far Dietzel has done no better than his predeces-
sor, Dale Hall. looking at their respective records. The
big test comes against Navy, a team Hall couldn’t beat.
We don’t think Dietzel will either.

* * ‘-1! * -

Dietzel singled out fullback Rick Leeson as the iriost
valuable performer for the Panthers in the Army game. “He
burst out of there "a few times real good,” Dietzel said. He
got some real valuable-ﬁrst down. When you’re playing‘ 8
chess—like game like we were. a first down is as important as
a touchdown in other games.” ,

Credit Given

Giving credit where it’s due: It was guard Tom Brown
who. kept Army’ from scoring the game—winning two-point
conversion try when he cut down Carnmy Lewis at the two-
yard line. Bob Roeder, who scored the_ big touchdown, said
Jeff Ware and John Telesky threw the blocks that got him
into the endzone. -

* * * 7*
\

Sportswriter Red Smith of the Herald-Tribune wrote a
column, entitled “Stone Age in the Bronx,” about the Pitt-

, Army game. He said it was a “Neanderthal collision of thresh-

_ ' 9:
ing monsters that was a mishmash of muscle and error.

He said the punting was great, but added, “for kicks
he (the fan) catches the Rockettes in the Music Hall or
goes to France for la savate.” ‘

* * *-*

Gene Ward, of the Daily. News, wrote:”“Pitt is the num-
ber_ one hot-and-cold team in the nation. . . ._ Bernie La-
Qunita didn’t get to play. Gad to see it, but how did Jim Irwin
become so good all of a sudden? . . . Coach John Michelosen
told his press agent on the Post-Gazette that we cancelled
our plane reservations to New York because of the story
we wrote. Bob Smizik had been promised the trip and We
made plans to motor to New York weeks ago.

Prince is Royal

We would like to thank Bob Prince for defending us on  _
his TV program. Bill Burns was the only other newsman who

reported the story without bias. A note of thanks also goes
to the Delta Zetas for their rewarding note of acknowledg-
ment of the writing awards we received last week.

NEW YORK — “You can’t
give up the ball as much as
we did and expect to beat
anyone,” said Army Coach
Paul Dietzel as he pondered

his teams 7-6 defeat to Pitt
at Yankee Stadium ‘Saturday in a r;
rugged defensive game which saw _
neither team do much in the way .

of offense.

Dietzel was correct. Just. about 
everytime the Cadets got a drive ‘

going they would give up the

ball ‘via fumbles or interceptions. _

The tought defensive battle was

in direct contrast to the Panth‘- '

ers last game against Notre Dame.
“We didn’t do anything different,”
said Coach Carl DePasqua. The
boys just did the job this week.”
Recovers Two Fumbles

There were some new names
doing the job for the Panthers.
Jimmy Irwin, who was ‘just
taken out of the ranks of the
“unplayables” last week, re-
covered two fumbles, one of
which set up the Panther’s score.

Jeff Ware got another chance
and played so well that he made

the defensive standout of the

last two games, Bernie La-

Quinta, strictly a spectator.

The Panthers lone score came
as the indirect result of the sud-
denly booming foot of punter
Pete Billey. “I was taking less
steps this week and thus getti g
better distance but less height,”
he said. _

Out On Two

Early in the second period
Billey punted out on the Army
two and put the Soldiers in a hole
they didn’t get out of until the
Panthers scored.

The score came after Irwin’s

Expect Rough Opposition From

Maryland in Important Meeting

By FRED MARCUS

Maryland hosts the soccer team at College Park today
at 2 p.m. in the NCAA quarter—ﬁnal championship round.
This is the fourth straight year for the Terrapins who have
an 8-0 mark, while the Panthers make their debut.

In other quarter—ﬁnal contests this week, St. Louis takes
on the Far West representative, the winners of the New

BOB ROEDER
Scores Touchdown

fumble recovery on the Army
14. Bob Roeder smashed over
from four yards out on fourth
down. Rick Leeson kicked the
extra point.

Army scored late in the third
period when Joe Blackgrove went
over from the three. Capnmy
Lewis tried to run over the extra
point but was stopped dead by the
powerful Irwin on a tackle which
caused Lewis to fumble.

Dietzel said, “I couldn’t justify
going for a tie in those circum-
stances. I wasn’t sure we'd get
another scoring chance.”

Once again the Army coach

was correct.

¢England and New York ‘State dis-

tricts meet, and Howard and
Michigan State, the two represen-
tatives—at—large, face each other.

A neutral ﬁeld was the original
possibility for the Panther-Mary-
land game site. Coach Leo Bemis
cited the following reasons why
this was ruled out:

1. A neutral site wos not read-
ily available.

2. Other neutral teams would
not, want the added work that
would go along with hosting an
NCAA tournament game.

3.» Maryland draws large crowds.

Enemy Impressive

After scouting the Maryland-
Navysoccer game last Wednes-
day, Bemis, extremely impressed
by the Terrapins, said, “I just
hope we can surprise them. We
must play an aggressive, ball-
hawking game and a consistent
wing game, Our defense has to be
really tough, too.”

“Maryland,”
“plays just like a European
team.” He cited their ball-
handling, which he felt was bet-
ter than Howard had shown
here. Howard was the toughest

Panther opposition to date.

“They play a short pass game,”

Bemis. said,

he added, “but they can* fast-
break if they need to.’-’ V
Mel Lorbach, West Chester

coach, says the Panthers’ chances
are good. He had suggested to
Bemis earlier this season, “If you
have a choice of where to play,

pick Maryland. Your players are ,

fast, and they’ll have more run-
ning room on the regulation-size
field at Maryland.”

After a scoreless second half,
the game went into overtime. A

for the winning score for the Phi

The Dithridge Raiders were

DelVecchio led Holland’s first

Seiger for another.
Vanzan used rollouts extensive-

sive halfbacks up from their po-
sitions. This strategy opened Joe
Seiger in the end zone for the
ﬁnal score of the day.

Here, with first and goal to go

four men in the backﬁeld. On
the next play, a high snap from

Seek Second Win
Against Cowards

By PAUL BRUTE

The Pitt News Hawks football
team will seek their second
straight victory against the Daily
Collegian Cowards of Penn State
in a touch-football game between
the two rival college newspapers
on the ‘morning of the Panther-
Lion clash at the Stadium.

This will be the ﬁfth meeting
of the two teams. «The Cowards
won three of the first four games
and tied the other time. Last year
the Hawks won, 13-12.

"The Hawks" have already been
beset with a big los's'to their
chances. Mike “Fifth Floor” Mar-
cusi, a 6-2, 270 pound staff re-
porter is going home to Lancaster
for the holidays.

Big Men

Taking his place will be Dave
“Forum” Menzer, a slight 220-
pounder who will plug up a big
ho1e—_——over near the stables at
Schenley Oval. And Matt “Nos-
tradamus” Nesvisky will help out
with his 220 pounds and a lot of
editorial power.
two will make up for the loss of
Marcuse.

Back for another suicidal at-.
tempt is Barry “Chicken” Gross,_
the fellow 'who was [stepped
on by his own teammate re-'
turning the opening vkick-off

.last year. . A V V

If «Jim “Juggernaut” O'Brien
can escape any ambushes this
week he will be there, too, along
with bodyguards Bob Smizik, Art

Specialist Marv Zelkowitz, a
newcomer to the team, will hold
the ball on kick-oﬁs, while wav-
ing the tattered ﬂag of Dithridge

The Panthers’ two ace freshman
cross-country runners, Dave Eich-

run in the freshman IC4A cham-
pionship meet in New York today.

Both runners, particularly Eich-
enlaub,
vrey good chances to ﬁnish high.
“We wouldn’t be.taking them if
we didn’t think they could do
do well,” said Coach Carl Rees.-

The meet will be run -over the
three mile Van Cortlandt Park

course. This is only the second,

year that the meet will be run
over the ‘Bronx course. Last year
the race was run in a blizzard, so
there is no standard for the run-
ners to meet. ' , ‘-
Has High Hopes

Coach Rees has high hopes for
Eichenlaub in this meet. Eichen-
laub is considered to be one of
the ﬁnest freshman runners this
university has had. His accom-
plishments include three victories
and two second places ﬁnishes in

are considered to have"

ﬁve meets.
-. Among his victories are wins
over Penn State and in the
Western Pennsylvania cross-
country championship of the

tion.
Hinchberger has been the sec-
ond man for the Panthers in ev-
ery freshman meet and is also

Position Well

By GIL l\IcDONALD

lit happens, sometimes, that
a team can be so deep at a
position that somewhere

down the list is someone

whose chances of getting into
a game are pretty bleak. Such

player is Bernie LaQuinta.
At the beginning of this sea-
son, sophomore fullback La-

Quinta found himself deep in the
pack among the fullbacks. With
such powerhouses as Rick Leeson
and John Telesky ahead of him,
and John Chisdak and Lou Slaby
also in line, fans stood little
chance of seeing LaQuinta take
the ﬁeld at fullback.

In the Baylor contest, however,
the dearth of centers which
the Panthers opened a

“pivot, but in the defensive aline-

ment at the center-linebacker
spot.
Likes Shift

He has been there ever since,
and since players “go both ways”,
he had added guard to his list
of positions. Pleased with the
shift, he said, “I like it a lot; I
really enjoy it,” and the en-
thusiasm which has m‘a1‘ked his

, play showed in his voice.

LaQuinta is happy over his
return to action too, even if
it has been on the second and
third units. At Mt. Lebanon
High, he saw constant service,
linebacking for his ﬁrst two
years and playing first—string
fullback also during his last
two. He was a four-year let-
terman for the Mounties, who
were 23--2-2_ during his‘ last
three. years. —

After backing up the line for
four years in high school, La-
Quinta is well qualiﬁed for his
new role. “It’s my best position,

_I guess,” he said, “but I have ’a
hard time bacause I’m so short.”; '

To compensate, he is learning to
“read” the blocking as it_ ma-

” terializes in front of him. “I slide

,,

along the line, ﬁnd the hole the
blocking is making and plug it,”

he said, putting the 1inebacker’s

mission in a nutshell.

Miss Cobes intercepted a Kathy

down, looked one way and ﬁred
in the other direction to Mac

After the game, Coach Rick
McGraﬁ', of McCormick Hall, said,
“Holland played a great game, but
we made too many mistakes.” He
cited Marilyn Reynolds as a de-
ﬁnite menace to his team’s cause,

“The whole team played terri-
ﬁcally,” said Ken Hill, Holland’s

of the game was “when we took
