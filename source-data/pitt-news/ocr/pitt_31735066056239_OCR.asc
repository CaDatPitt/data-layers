City police detectives arrested
two Pitt football players, along
with a former player, in a
Saturday afternoon drug raid of
the suspects’ East Liberty apart-
ment.

Reuben Brown, 20, an offen-
sive lineman, Jermaine Williams,
21, a running back and Derrick
Hicks, 22, defensive lineman
who was dismissed from the
team in 1991, were arrested and
charged with criminal conspira-
cy to distribute crack cocaine.

The detectives discovered
$7,500 worth of suspected crack
and $1,600 in cash hidden in the
apartment. The raid was con-
ducted after a three-week inves-
tigation, according to Detective
Joe Meyers, who participated in
the arrest.

“The investigation was based
on complaints we had gotten
from several sources about a
high volume of drug activity at

Pro-Choice students
pleased with Clinton

By Kelly B. Casey
Photography Editor

 

At 6 a.m. last Friday morning, seven Pitt students boarded a bus
headed for the annual Pro—Life march in Washington, DC. With the
opposition out of town, about 50 Pro-Choice students and others
congregated under the William Pitt Union pavilion on this rainy day
at noon to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Supreme Court
decision Roe vs. Wade, which legalized abortions.

The rally began with a chant led by Mary Litman co-president of
the Squirrel Hill National Organization of Women, who spelled out
the demands of the small but vocal group. “What do we want?
Abortion rights! When do we want it?” The crowd answered with a
hearty “Now!”

later that day President Clinton answered those demands when
he signed three presidential memorandunis which overturned a
series of abortion restrictions:

0 the ban on abortions at military hospitals.

0 the ban on the use of fetal tissue for research.

0 the ban on abortion counseling at clinics being federally sup-
ported.

“We now have a supporting president. Thank God,” sighed a
member of the Campus Women’s Organization.

Although President Clinton was the focus of the optimistic speak-
ers, former President Bush and 12 years of Republican reign was
not forgotten.

“We are now freed  from 12 years of hostility and oppression,”
said National Abortion Rights Action League political organizer
Carol Silvestre. She then mentioned the three bans of the Pro-
Choice movement left behind by the Republican legacy — the gag
rule, the ban on fetal tissue research and the ban on the importation
of RU486, the French abortion pill.

"ProChoice America must remain vigilant or the right of freedom
with fade,” said Silvestre, a former Pitt student with a masters
degree in social work and public adrriinistration.

Loud cheers echoed as NOW President Chris Niebryzdowski
reminded the crowd that later that day Clinton was expected to

WASHINGTON, D.C. —- Eight
members of Pitts Students for Life
(SfL) were among the 75,000 who
marched the streets of the capital
on Friday to protest abortion.

“We are here to show both the
politicians and country that there
are many of us [who support the
right to lifel,” SfL President Caleb
Cohen said.

Before arriving in the city, the
group prayed and passed out lit-
erature to get into the right frame
of mind for the day.

People from across the United
States, young, old, male and
female, joined together on an
overcast day to voice their beliefs
on the rights of life.

‘We’re here to speak for them
[the unborn], because they can’t
speak for themselves,” Pitt junior
Tera Smith said.

The crowd marched holding
signs high and singing “God
Bless America” and “Battle Hymn
of the Republic.”

Some of the signs read, “How
would you like it if your child
poisoned you, crushed your
skull, cut your limbs apart and
threw you down the garbage dis-
posal," “Womb —— A Place Called
Hope” and “Stop FOCA
(Freedom of Choice Act) now.”
Other signs were graphic pictures
of highly—developed aborted
fetuses.

Detective Joe Meyers said he
had no idea that the alleged
crack dealers he was busting
were Pitt football players until
he saw inside the East Liberty
apartment.

“Once we got inside ‘we saw
Pitt football letter jackets and
other stuff, and it started to
dawn on us,” Meyers said.

According to one officer
who refused to be identified,
the 6—foot--4-inch, 310—pound
Reuben Brown answered the
door when the police
knocked. The size of the shirt-
less 20-year-old took the detec-
tives aback.

“Brown was in tears,” the l

kept saying he couldn’t believe
it had gone this far."

The players’ South Negley
Avenue apartment was raided
Saturday after‘ a three-week
investigation sparked by 
repeated complaints of drug
activity in the three—story beige 3
building. Finding $1,600 in
cash and three ounces of crack
cocaine, the detectives arrested
Brown, Williams and Hicks for
conspiracy to deliver crack.

According to the unidenti-
fied officer, a 4-year-old girl
was sitting on a couch when

Students forgot names
during hypnosis demo

By David Weimer
Staff Writer

Three students forgot their
names and dozens were
affected during a hypnosis
demonstration in the
Kurtzman Room of the
William Pitt Union.

Thursday's event drew an
audience of around 100 stu-
dents and was sponsored by
the Self Knowledge
Symposium (SKS). Before it
began Al Fitzpatrick, speaker
and hypnotist, said, “I’m
going to challenge them with
hypnosis and take it step by
step, answering questions.”

And he did. In a soothing
voice, Fitzpatrick described
his background in psychology
and then explained how he‘
became interested in hypno-
sis, setting the scene for the
night’s events.

Once he had everyone’s
attention, he led the audience
through a series of relaxation
exercises. Eventually, several
members of the audience
looked -more than relaxed.
Fitzpatrick said, “I am talking
to your arms, your arms can
hear me now.”

He told the relaxed people
that their left arms will feel as
if they were floating like heli-
um balloons. After most of
the audience had stopped

shaking their heads, a handful
of students remained seated
with their arms raised as
though they were asking
questions.

Fitzpatrick turned to the
audience, “What is happening
here? What’s going on?”

One person in the audience
offered, “They were in a
relaxed state and susceptible
to your suggestions.”

“Why?” Fitzpatrick asked.
The person was not sure.

Fitzpatrick asked for volun-
teers from the audience and
chose three of the students
whose hands remained mys-
teriously in the air. He put
each of them into a “trance,”
or “highly receptive state of
mind,” and convinced them
that their feet were attached
to the ground. No one had
any glue, and no bone
touched their feet.

“What has happened?” he
asked the audience.

People from the audience
asked the volunteers ques-
tions and got answers.
Nobody seemed to have an
explanation.

Then Fitzpatrick talked to
each of the volunteers while
they were in a “trance” and
changed their names.
Speaking in a continuous,
soothing voice he gave each

Pitt graduate named
to Pa.'s Supreme Court

By Matt Groff
Staﬂ Writer

At the open court admis-
sions ceremony on Dec.21,
1992, Pitt graduate Rose E.
Constantino,Ph.D., became the
first Philippine-born nurse,
attorney at law to be admitted
to the Supreme Court of the
Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.

By accomplishing this
unique status, Constantino
hopes to add her overall clini-
cal experience as a new
dimension to the cases in
which she is involved.

“I am speciﬁcally interested
in psychiatric mental health
issues,” Constantino said.“I
think my nursing experience
gives me a deeper knowledge
of ethical issues and research.”

Speciﬁcally, Constantino said
one interest she has in legal
matters involves patients of
schizophrenia.

“I would like for them to
have equal rights and better
treatment,” Constantino said.

Constantino plans to handle
cases through the Women’s
Bar Association and
Neighborhood Legal Services
Association.

She brings extensive clinical
experience with research to
her law practice. In recent

years she was involved in
studies concentrating on wid-
ows’ grief and mourning and
later studies on the survivors of
suicide.

In her research for Pitt,
Constantino is currently in the
second year of a three—year
study on how families cope
when a member commits sui-
cide. She is principle investiga-
tor of this study sponsored by
the National Institutes of
Health’s National Center for
Nursing Research.

“At this point we are finding
that it is not just the spouses
who suffer,” Constantino said.
“Others, especially children
and siblings, need more help
than spouses do.”

Constantino, a 1971
University of Pittsburgh School
of Nursing graduate, also grad-
uated from Duquesne Law
School and received her
undergraduate education in
the Philippines. She currently
works as an associate profes-
sor of psychiatric mental health
nursing at Pitt’s School of
Nursing.

Constantino said she
believes that her license to

' practice law will make her a

better faculty member and
enhance her work on research
and other projects within Pitt’s
School of Nursing.

BAS commemorated
computer lab takeover

By Jason Blaney
For Tbe Pitt News

The Black Action Society
commemorated the Computer
Room takeover last Thursday
with the help of Dr. jack
Daniel, Pitt’s vice provost of
Academic Affairs and the
African Drama Class, which
did a re-enactment of the
event.

On Jan. 16, 1969, 48 African-
American students took over
the Cathedral of Learning com-
puter room. They locked
themselves in the room while
others presented their list of
demands to former Pitt
President Wesley Posvar.

The group named itself the
“Black Action Society,” and its
demands were expressed as
the “Voice of the Black
Community.”

The groups’ goals were to
obtain more African—American
faculty, more programs geared
to African-American students
and to design a more relevant
educational system for Africans
and African Americans alike.

With the help of Dr. Vernell

Lillie and her African Drama
Class, this part of Pitt’s history
was brought back to life.

For most, this was a time for
celebration. However, for
Daniel it was something more
than just a celebration of the
events of that one day.

Daniel said he does not
want the computer room
takeover to become merely a
glorification of one event, but
wants to stress the ongoing
sacrifices and “total commit-
ment” of the students
involved.

“I think Dr. Daniel has a
point. People, I think, have to
stop looking at the glory of an
event or a person but, instead,
look at the meaning behind it,”
BAS member Oronde Sharif
said.

Daniel spoke of holding
onto the ideals and commit-
ment of those times. The sacri-
fices made by those individu-
als was just a start. According
to Daniel, there has to be a
continual commitment of all
African Americans to fight
racism and improve the condi-
tions of all African Americans.

Sexual assault occarrea’
in Brace Hall last wee/e

By John Temple
Staff Writer

A male student sexually
assaulted a female student in
his Bruce Hall room last
Tuesday morning, according to
a police report filed by the vic-
tim.

The victim was staying
overnight in the suspect’s room
after a Monday night party
when the alleged incident
occurred, according to campus
police. At 3:50 a.m. the suspect
allegedly fondled the victim
forcibly and against her will.

The victim filed a report
against the male student, but
decided to not file charges a
couple of days later. Campus

police have interviewed the
suspect.

The incident resembles sever-
al rape and sexual assault cases
that occurred last fall. In the
four incidents reported, all
occurred in the students’ rooms
and three were by men they
knew. Two occurred after par-
ties or bar—hopping.

As in last Tuesday’s case, the
victims who were raped or
assaulted by men they knew
reported the incidents but did
not file charges.

Even if the victim cannot
decide whether to file charges,
police advise them to report
rapes and sexual assaults as
soon as possible so fresh evi-
dence can be gathered.

dents are talking about any-

way,” he said.

The University of

mance group called
Beautiful Hands will per-
form at the Cultural Fair on

pated in the raid but asked
not to be identiﬁed, said that
all three men were present
during the buy. The officer
said police believe Hicks is
attempting to take the blame
for the sale.

Hicks told police that he
bought the crack in his home-
town of Detroit and brought it
back to sell in Pittsburgh.

Meyers said he believes that
it was a fairly small drug oper-
ation.

“If they did have many local
connections, I don’t think he’d
be going to Detroit by himself
to buy it,” Meyers said.

Pitt Athletic Department offi-
cials refused to comment.

“I have no knowledge of
any such incident,” new Pitt

head coach Johnny Majors
said Saturday through a
spokesperson. “Therefore,
until I receive further notice, I
will not comment.”

Brown, a junior from
Lynchburg, Va., was one of
the most highly recruited
defensive linemen in the
country during his senior year
in high school. He switched to
offensive lineman in 1991 and
earned third-team Freshman
All-American honors from The
Sporting News.

The same year, Brown was
disciplined by the university’s
Judicial Board for allegedly
assaulting Stan Clark, a team
manager, according to the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Brown
allegedly knocked Clark’s
head against a wall after

accusing him of taking one of
his jackets.

This season Brown earned
All—Big East Conference hon-
ors at offensive tackle.

Williams, a senior tailback
from Detroit, Mich., is
described by the Athletic
Department as “a swift, pow-
erful back [who] adds a valu-
able dimension to Pitt’s back-
field."

According to the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, Hicks was dis-
missed from the team during
his junior year in 1991 after he
and two other players were
accused of taking and using
another player’s credit card.

cer did not know the girl’s identi-
ty. The girl was later taken to a
youth services center.

The three suspects were play-
ing Nintendo when detectives
crowded in to search the
disheveled apartment, according
to Detective Maurice Jones.

“We’ve seen better apartments,
but then again We’ve seen worse,”
said Jones. “They seemed like
they were more into fashion than
keeping the place up. A lot of
clothes, a lot of tennis shoes.”

A woman behind the closed
door of the suspects’ third—floor
apartment said yesterday that
Hicks had been alone in the crack
dealing.

“Reuben and Jermaine have not
done anything wrong but be at
home,” said the woman, who did
not reveal her identity. “They
were just giving [Hicksl a place to
live because he didn’t have any-
where else to stay.”

Hicks has admitted to selling
crack earlier in the day and to
buying the crack in Detriot and
bringing it to Pittsburgh. But,

according to the unidentified offi-
cer, police believe that Hicks is
attempting to take the fall for
Williams and Brown.

A neighbor said he had been
woken by the footsteps of a
horde of cops in the middle of the
afternoon. He said he never sus-
pected them of drug dealing
despite a stream of visitors.

“I thought they were just col-
lege kids, that’s all,” said the
neighbor, who asked not to be
identified. “We never had any
trouble with them. They speak to
me, speak to my wife every day.”

Two women who lived next
door said that they had been
friends with the suspects.

“They were really cool guys,”
said one woman who asked not
to be identified. When asked if
she knew whether they sold
drugs 01‘ not, the woman seemed
uncomfortable when she replied.

“I don’t know,” she said. “What
can I say?”

PittBasketballis hot 

Wednesday evening at the Civic Arena, the nationally-
ranked Pitt men’s basketball team hosts Big East rival
Syracuse. Pitt is one of the hottest teams in college bas-
ketball, carrying a four—game winning streak and 15-2
record that has lifted the team to a first—place tie in the
Big East Conference. In any other city in America fans
would be frothing at the mouth, counting the collective
hours until game time. But this is Pittsburgh, national
capital of basketball illiteracy, 4,000 seats still remain for

this game. If the rest of Pittsburgh isn’t turned on to the .

breathtaking, heart—stopping, last—second antics of the
sizzling Panthers by now, at least the student body of
this university should be.

The student fan support at the Seton Hall game was
critical to Pitt’s upset victory, and many Panther players
would frankly tell you it may have been the difference
in the outcome. But the student body of this university
has yet to demonstrate consistent support for its teams,
especially this team.

Students do attend the large majority of home games
and fill their section to near capacity, but they often fall
silent for large portions of the action. To truly support
this team requires unabashed enthusiasm for each and
every game, the entire game, whether it is played at
beloved Fitzgerald Field House or the hated Civic Arena.
Even if the game was being played outside in the snow
the student body must make itself seen, and more
importantly heard, in order for the Panthers to get the
most of their homecourt advantage.

March for life

Eighty-seven thousand people marched in Washington,
D.C. this weekend to protest the famous Roe vs. Wade
ruling of 20 years ago. Vowing to never give up their
fight against abortion, they were strong in number led
by the two Pats -— Robertson and Buchanan.

While we do admire these protestors for their forti-
tude, we have to disagree with them on most of their
stances. We only hope that both sides of the abortion
fence will be able to unite and fight for the real issue
involved.

This will not occur through malicious and pointless
name—ca.lling like “anti—lifers" and “pro-abortionists.” Nor
will their be any favorable results from the other side
screaming about “anti—choicers.” To frame the issue in
that fashion only serves to bury the issue further, and
make it tougher to accomplish the real goals.

The Supreme Court has made their ruling we have
elected a pro-choice president who issued an executive
order eliminating the gag—rule and who is now pushing
for the legalization of the birth control device RU—486.

Rather than making silly assumptions about the other
side’s moral stand, both groups should come together to
work on decreasing the number of abortions performed
each year. The only way to accomplish this goal is to
increase the"amount of information on how the hum-
an body works and the implications of sexual inter-
course.

SGB President learned from Posvar

Over the past few years, the
administration has sent a clear
message to the students, one that
says in effect, “We are free to
spend your tuition and tax dol-
lars however we want.” The most

 

often employed case of this rule
is administrators, especially top
people, spending money on
themselves for offices, “corona-
tions,” etc. Now it appears that
the Student Government Board
has picked up the idea. Their
exorbitantly expensive retreat is
symptomatic of the continual

mishandling of educational"

money at Pitt and many other
schools.

The actions of (Wesley) Posvar
and (1. Dennis) O’Connor, as rep-
resentatives of the administration
in general, have sadly con-
tributed greatly to our education.
The administration has employed
a very potent form of education
— teaching by example. I hope
that the rest of us are too smart
to fall into the “monkey see,
monkey do” trap.

No business in Iraq

After having read the editorial
“-Bombing Iraq,” The Pitt News,
Jan. 14, I was surprised that the

dd’
2*

Pitt editorial staff did not stray
from reinforcing that national,
high school level, tough-guy
mentality, something like Bush is

going to save face with Hussein;
after he secured a dubious exon-
eration in the Iran-Contra affair! If
we Can free our minds from
what’s dictated in the network of
American propaganda, like
bombing Iraq is the necessary
decision of the U.N., which
amounts to roughly a handful of
countries involved in the actual
participation, those ironically that
had a history of oppressing and
colonizing the region, it is real-
ized the world is not in approval
of the U.S.-led destruction.

Pertaining to the Gulf War,
what was the purpose of the fab-
rication about Iraqi soldiers
killing babies in incubators if not
to prop up support for the wide-
scale attack? ,

What current tactics of decep-

LETTERS

 

tion are being fumished through
the media to conceal the broader
scope of the bombing, which
entails the Iraqi people terrorized
and starved, into a political
change conducive to Israeli and
American design?

The editorial states that
“regardless of the motive the
actions of the allies are justified.”
What kind of made-to—order prin-
ciple is this? Isn’t it just fine to
plaster and mold morality that
those “economic and financial
interests” mentioned in the edito-
rial are so coincidental to
Hussein being this bad man to
be dealt with by engaging in war
halfway around the world?

What are these “covert military
operations” that Hussein is
accused of in the editorial? Like
how dare he wish to employ air
defenses in his own territory.
He’s only had cities bombed to

smithereens!
And as far as this obsession
with Iraq's infantile nuclear

“development it would be better

to focus concern on war like
Israel’s nuclear arsenal.

What aggression has Iraq com-
mitted on American soil or to our
citizens? Think of our cities being
bombed by a greater power after
we invaded Panama.

It’s for life’s sake that we nur-
ture paths to peace or we hasten
the world on a collision course
with disaster.

Campus lighting needed

I am writing to express the
need for more lighting in the
area of Hillman Library and
Forbes Quadrangle. More lighting
is needed for the welfare of the
whole student body, in particular
women. Some people are afraid
to walk home or to their vehicles
at night. Fear should not be a
factor in deciding if you should
study at night. For the safety of
the whole campus population,
more lighting is needed.

Men’

The basketball gods high up
on Mount Naismith all but
handed the Pitt Panthers their
fourth straight victory Saturday
night as they squeaked by the
Miami Hurricanes 86-84 in one
of the most bizarre finishes in
Big East history.

The underdog Hurricanes

smelled the

s w e e’ t

aroma of
an upset
victory fill
their arena.
A five-point
lead with
under a minute to play had
their bench buzzing with

excitement. Little did they
know that the winds that had
blown in their school-record-
tying 12 three pointers would
soon shift against them as they
fell victim to the greatest blun-
der in Big East history.

Miami first-year guard Steven
Edwards capped off a game
high 26 points when he sunk
the back end of a pair of free
throws giving the Canes an 83-
78 lead with 1:06 -left in the
game. Pitt’s Jerry McCullough
pushed the ball upcourt and
hit Antoine Jones for a layup
to cut the Miami lead to three.

With 51 seconds left, Pitt
fouled the Hurricanes hottest
shooter, Jake Morton. The
senior, who hit four three
pointers, including some from

NBA range, could only knock
down one free throw, and
McCullough pushed the ball
back the other way. After
drawing a foul, McCullough
lived up to his nickname as
“Ice” nailed both shots from
the charity stripe, putting the
Panthers within two at 84-82.

Four more missed Hurricane
free throws and 20 seconds
later, the stage was set for the
most preposterous blunder in
Florida history since Ponce de
Leon mistook some rancid
pond water for the Fountain of
Youth.

With 18.2 seconds remaining
in the game, Pitt called a time
out to mull over the two-point
Hurricane lead. After delibera-
tions by both teams, the offi-

basketball blessedby bizarre 86-84 winat Miami

cial horn sounded and Pitt
lined up under the Miami bas-
ket for a prepared inbounds
play. Even after a second horn
sounded Miami still had not
broken from its huddle. The
referee signaled to start the
clock and handed the ball to
senior forward Chris McNeal,
who quickly inbounded to
Jerry McCullough for the
uncontested layup tying the
score at 84.

Miami hustled back onto the
court and inbounded the ball
with just under 12 seconds to
play. As Edwards, who had six
three pointers in the contest,
dribbled toward the Pitt bas-
ket, McCullough streaked by
and swiped the ball, in-
medias-dribble, from Edwards.

Rande Stottlemyer was
not pleased. His team was
down 12-6 to home-
favored and 16th-ranked
Navy, and he had just
made a lineup change that
did not pay off.

Moving 177-pound John
Gilbeaut to 167,
Stottlemyer thought the
Panthers could get a win

and be back in the match
at 12-9. But the Pitt
wrestling coach thought
wrong.

Instead, Gilbeaut, who
was up 4-1 at one point in
his match, lost. That loss,
followed by three straight
Panther wins at 177, 190
and the heavyweight class,
made Stottlemyer all the
more somber at the 15-15
comeback tie.

“Going into 167 we were

Failed gamble leaves wrestling ﬁt to be tied by Navy

down 12-6 and I thought it
was time to roll the dice a
little bit,” Stottlemyer said
of his gamble. “We had a
chance to win the match if
Gilbeaut won.”

Forced to rely on the
heavier weights because of
Panther losses at 118, 126,
142 and 158, Stottlemyer
knew he had the “horses”
on deck that could sink
the Midshipmen’s hopes
for victory.

Panthers Sean Gibbs

(moved from his normal
weight of 167), Jeff Kloiber
and Pat Wiltanger faced a
nine-point deficit and
came through strong.
Winning three straight
decisions, however, was
not enough for the win.
“Gibber [Gibbs] did a
really good job,”
Stottlemyer said. “K1oiber

With one Hurricane to beat
and 6.5 ticks tumbling off the
clock, McCullough passed
upcourt to Antoine Jones, who
laid the ball in over the lone
Miami defender to give Pitt an
86-84 lead. Miami’s ensuing
timeout with one second left
proved fruitless and Jones’
basket was his second game
winner of the season as Pitt
recorded its third consecutive
Big East road victory.

“We stole one here tonight.
We had the basketball gods
with us in those last couple
minutes,” Coach Paul Evans
said. “A year ago we would

we probably would not have

Pitt men's

MORGANTOWN, W. Va.
— The men’s swimming and
diving team headed to West
Virginia last Saturday look-
ing to give assistant coach
David Amato a victory
against his former coach
and team.

Actually, Pitt was also
hoping to get back on track
after a loss to Penn State
last weekend had left every-
one with a bad taste still in
their mouths.

The Panthers did both in
convincing fashion as they
disposed of the
Mountaineers 142-101
behind a flurry of excellent
swims.

Pitt swam well despite
many of its swimmers racing
in unfamiliar events, and
head coach Chuck Knoles
said that he was impressed
with that.

“It was really nice to swim
well in our off events,”
Knoles said. “We had a lot
of diversity as far as our
lineup was concerned, but
were still able to win the
meet.”

Huskies of
the Big East
have been
in and out
of the Top 20 nationally all
season and they served the
Panthers their most crushing
blow of the season, a 73-52
blowout in front of 4,847 at
the Harry A. Gimpel Pavilion
in Connecticut.

For the first time in recent
memory, the Panthers jumped
out to an early lead. That lead
would be short-lived, howev-
er, as the Huskies came back
to capture the lead for them-
selves at 11-10.

The lead changed hands
several times after that until
midway through the half
when the Huskies started to
pull away. Having shot only
25 percent from the field and
having been dominated on the
boards, the Panthers could not
stay with the superior Huskies
in the first half. Only the play
of Panther forward Jonna
Huemrich kept her team rea-
sonably close. But even she
could not stop Rebecca Lobo,
the Connecticut superstar who
sparked the 23-9 run that
brought the first half to a close
with UConn ahead 36-22.

From that point on, the
Huskies never looked back.
They increased their lead to
20 points shortly after the
beginning of the second half.

Pitt waged a slight surge as
the half wore on, with
Huemrich and guard Erin
Maloy leading the charge. The

Men's track and field
places three in IC4As

Byjason Feuchtwanger
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s track team
traveled to Virginia Tech
this weekend and came
back with three Eastern
Championship (IC4As) qual-
ifiers.

“This was a good meet for
us,” Pitt head coach John
Vasvary said.

The Panthers were the
lone Big East school at
Virginia Tech, where they
took on a 28—team field
which featured squads from
the ACC and SEC confer-
ences.

Junior Jim Monk, the two-
mile relay team and the dis-
tance medley team all quali-
fied for the IC4As.

Monk qualified ' in the
shot—put with a throw of 51-
8. He finished in fifth place.

“That was his best indoor
throw ever,” Vasvary said.

The distance medley team
qualified with a time of 10
minutes, 12.2 seconds,
which was good enough for
a fourth—place finish.

The team consists of Mike

Umbleby, who led off with
the 1200-meter, Wayne
Smith ran the 400—meter,
Devvon Bradley ran the 800-
meter leg and Frank Nesko
anchored with the 1600-
meter.

Umbleby, Bradley and
Nesko teamed up with Mark
Bufaliney in the two-mile
relay to finish with a quali-
fying time of 7:501. They
finished in second place.

“Frank [Nesko] ran very
well for us, he ran two good
anchors for us,” Vasvary
said.

There was a ba-lance of
underclassmen and upper-
classmen that turned in
strong performances.

Junior Mike Lynn ran to a
third—place finish in the
3000-meter with a time of
8:37.4, while Senior Dave
Senay threw the shot to a
mark of 48-8.

First-year students Jay
Jones and Jay -Murphy
sprinted to sixth place fin-
ishes in the 55-meter dash
and 55 high hurdles respec-
tively. Jones finished with a

W/omens tmcle proves talent at Va. T ecb

By Matt Groff
Staff Writer

By rising to the occasion
on Saturday at the Virginia
Tech Invitational, the Pitt
women’s indoor track team
proved that it can compete
with the strongest teams in
the east.

Even though it was a
non—scoring ‘meet, the
Panthers placed several top
finishers against teams like
North Carolina State,
University of North Carolina
and Virginia Tech.

“We had a fantastic meet,”
Pitt track Coach Steve Lewis
said. “Even though we were
facing some of the best of
the ACC and SEC, if it
would have been a scoring
meet we would have been
a strong contender for first
place.” -

According to Lewis, the
key to the to the Panthers’
successful showing was the
strength and consistency of
the seniors.

Leading the way was Pitt
senior Allison Williams who
finished second in the 55-
meter hurdles and set a

new Pitt record. Her time
qualified her to run in the
national championships ' in
that event. Two other Pitt
hurdlers, Najuma Fletcher
and Staci Suggs, qualified
for the Easter Collegiate
Athletic Conference
(ECACS) competition

“Williams had a superb
performance,” Lewis said.
“Not only did she break the
Pitt record she already held,
but certainly she ran one of
the best times in the coun-
try at this point in the sea-
son.”

The 400-meter run proved
to be one of Pitt’s strongest
events as Pitt runners cap-
tured the top three spots.
First-year student Tanya
Mullins finished first for Pitt
on her way to qualifying for
ECACs. Senior Monica
Hockaday and junior Kim
Blair rounded out the top
three.

Seniors Joanne Warner
and Carmela Mariani, who
have both struggled with
injuries this season, contin-
ued to make successful
comebacks. Warner not
only turned in a first—place

finish in the 20—pound
weight throw, but smashed
a Pitt record in doing so.
She also placed second in
shot—put. Mariani, who was
sidelined until last week,
placed third in the 5000-
meter run.

The distance medley
team, an area which Lewis
feels is one of Pitt’s

strengths, continued its win-
ning ways. The 4 x 100
(Judy Facey, Lakeya Smith,
Natasha Van Riel, Tonia
Malloy) and the 4 x 400
(Malloy, Hockaday, Blair,
Mullins) relays both ran to
first—place finishes. The 4 x
800 relay squad took third
place.

“The biggest reason our
team is running so well
would be the leadership of
our seniors,” Lewis said.
“Their success takes the
pressure off the more inex-
perienced runners and
allows them room to grow.”

Their next meet is
Saturday against Eastern
Michigan, Michigan and
Michigan State among oth-
ers at the Eastern Michigan
Invitational.

Pitt women's swim and dive comeback comes up short

By Jeff Kamis
Staff Writer

MORGANTOWN, W. Va. — As the

results of the three-meter ‘diving’ com- 4

petition came in, it was clear that the
outcome of the Pitt women’s swim-
ming and diving meet with West
Virginia would be decided in the very
last event, the 400-yard freestyle relay.
But West Virginia’s top relay team
came up big, stopping Pitt’s improba-

~ ble comeback just shy of completion,

in a 126-117 Mountaineer victory.

Pitt head coach David Belowich said
that he was happy with his team’s
effort despite the loss.

“We just came up a little short, West
Virginia did a nice job,” Belowich said.
“We got behind by a lot early, but
nobody quit or backed off.”

Early on, Pitt’s hopes of a victory
looked bleak as the team trailed by 31
points just after the halfway point of
the meet. West Virginia’s Renee Riccio
had taken victories in both the 200
individual medley and the 200 butter-
fly, helping to put the Lady
Mountaineers in control.

But then the Panthers kicked in into
high gear, with first-year swimmer Jill
Fletcher winning the 100 freestyle, fol-
lowed by victories in the 200 back-
stroke and the 500 freestyle by Christy
Knobloch and Susan Poorbaugh
respectively.

After Amanda Simmons held off
Pitt’s Fletcher for a win in the 200
breaststroke, the swimmers and the
crowd had to wait for the results of
the three—meter diving competition.
Earlier, first-year diver

Sunday’

Lewandowski had won the one-meter
competition. Pitt needed a similar out-
come in the three—meter for any hope
of victory.

Lewandowski came through once
again for the Panthers, leading a one-
two-three finish for Pitt and tying the
team score at 113.

Belowich said that he was very
impressed with his team’s perfor-
mances, especially those of Knobloch.

“Christy has problems with her back
that are very painful, but she wasn’t to
be denied,” Belowich said. “She gave
everything she had, and, as a coach,
you love to see that.”

Senior co-captain Clare McShane
also had a good meet, winning-the 200
freestyle and placing second in the 500
freestyle. '

“Clare had a really fine performance

all the way through,” Belowich said.
Belowich said that he was also

pleased with two of his first-year

swimmers, Fletcher and Poorbaugh.

“lFletcherl swam real well and_

[Poorbaugh] is really coming on, gain-
ing a lot of confidence in herself and
not being afraid to race.”

Assistant coach Laure Walczak said
that Pitt knew it would be a tight meet
with the Lady Mountaineers.

“We knew it was going to be close

and could go either way,” Walczak
said. “Unfortunately it didn’t go our
way.”
SPLISHES AND SPLASHES: The
Panthers’ next meet is this Friday
when they travel to the University of
Maryland for a 2 p.m. meet before
heading to Villanova for a 12 pm.

the hump.”

Indeed, the basketball gods
have been more favorable to
the Panthers as three of their
last four victories have come
in the last few seconds. But
Coach Evans was quick to add
that a gift like Miami’s blunder
was not the only reason for
Saturday’s win and gave credit
to his players.

“They just never gave up.
They came up to every huddle
like they were going to win
the game,” Evans said.

PITT BITS: Pitt’s Big East
record is now 6-2 (13-2 over-
all) — this was the third con-
secutive Big East road win for
the Panthers. They only had
two all of last year and have

not won three in a row on the V

road since the ‘87-’88 season.
Miami Coach Leonard
Hamilton said he did not hear
the buzzer during the last time
out, yet both the cheerleaders
and the band stopped per-
forming and the 15,000 seat
Miami Arena had only 4,254
spectators. Ahmad Shareef
scored all of his 13 points in
the second half. Going into the
game Pitt was tied with St.

did a nice job, too. But if
we would have won one
down below [in the lower
weights] we would have
been able to leave Gibbs at
167.”

Not having that luxury,
Stottlemyer made his forced
move, and with it tied
instead of winning outright.

“We came down here to
win and not to tie,”
Stottlemyer said. “But we
have to be glad we tied a
ranked team. It’s sort of a
paradox.

“You aim high and that’s
the way you get better,”
Stottlemyer said of his goals
on winning. “But we have
had a pretty good schedule
and we are 1-1-1 against
three Top 20 teams.”

Pitt also wrestled Coppin
State this weekend at Navy.
The Panthers took advan-
tage of a less-talented and
injury—plagued team and
won easily, 51-3.

Forfeiting three matches,
Coppin State gave away 18
points without even making
a Panther sweat.

But when the Panthers did
sweat, it wasn’t very much.
Pitt rolled with pin after pin
over an outclassed Coppin
State.

“It’s nice to have a
sense that there is no high
intensity in the match,”
Stottlemyer said. “It’s no life
or death situation, we could
have some fun [against
Coppin].”

The Navy tie and Coppin
State win raised Pitt’s over-
all record to 3-1-1 as the
team gears up for Cleveland
State this Wednesday at
Fitzgerald Field House at
7:30 p.m.

ES: The Panthers will next
be in action this weekend
as they travel to the
University of Maryland for
a 2 p.m. meet on Friday
before heading to
Villanova for a 12 p.m.
Saturday meet.

Senior co-captain Kevin
McLaughlin, who was
denied victory in the 200
breaststroke due to some
questionable officiating,
said that the team was
very excited about the
meet.

“Everyone was fired up
for the meet,” McLaughlin
said. “We were a little
more emotional about it
and we swam really well.”

Knoles said that this was
a nice victory for his
young squad.

“This is a big comeback
for us after the loss to be
able to walk in and swim

To Discuss Possible Uses of the
Two-Block Academic Complex

\Tuesday, January 26, 1993
12:00 - 2:00 P.M.

Room 332 Cathedral of Learning

The .Provost’s Advisory Committee for the Two-Block
Academic Complex will hold an open forum to provide an
opportunity for members of the University community to present

constructed under the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s Operation
Jump Start Program. It is intended to house academic and
administrative support programs including classrooms, offices, and
teaching laboratories. The building, which will be located on a site
bounded by Forbes Avenue, Oakland Avenue, Bouquet Street, and
Sennott Street, will have 90,000 to 100,000ft’ of usable space and is
estimated to be available in the Fall of 1996.

If you are interested in presenting a request for space in this new
building, or if you wish to comment about other proposed occupants
for the building, you should contact W. Richard Howe at Ext. 46090.
Presentations should be limited to 5 - 10 minutes and should be
accompanied by a formal written proposal.

Proposals should include a statement that justifies the
assignment of space in this building, a careful estimate of the
number and mix of persons to be housed, the amount of space
needed, and a description of the type of space requested (i.e. offices,
classrooms, laboratories, and any special requirements).

Huskies improved to an

impressive 56.7 percent.

UConn continued to domi-
nate on the boards as well.
The Huskies pulled down 47
rebounds to Pitt’s 23 for the
game.

Lobo was the star for
UConn at both ends of the
floor, finishing the game
with an amazing 22 points,
10 rebounds and all five of
the game’s blocked shots.

With the Huskies dominat-
ing both the perimeter and
the glass, the Panthers could

not help but watch as
UConn coasted to the easy
21-point victory.

The Panthers must now
recover from this loss and
prepare to face an even
greater challenge as the
nationally-ranked Miami
Hurricanes visit Fitzgerald
Field House this Friday
night.

Despite losing last year’s
Big East Player of the Year,
Frances Savage, Miami has
been playing great basket-
ball this season. The
Hurricanes should easily
prove to be Pitt’s most diffi-
cult test of the season.
