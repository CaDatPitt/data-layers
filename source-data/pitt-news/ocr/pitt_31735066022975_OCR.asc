The Student Government
-Board’s Task Force for the
student activities fee ‘agreed
Wednesday to accept a pro-
posal calling for a $12 per term
increase in the fee, bringing
the new fee to $24 per term.
The current activities fee of A
$12 a term has not been raised
since its inception in 1966.
The task force is studying the
feasibility of raising the ac-
ivities fee and determining
where the extra monies should
be used.

The $24 ﬁgure is based on a
plan by SGB president Stan
Galanski, and president-elect
Bill Abraham that would
authorize three groups to
allocate funds to organizations
under their jurisdiction.

Under the Galanski-Abra-
ham plan:

—The Media and Pub-
lications Board would receive
15 ‘ percent (aproximately
$82,5000) of the fee to
distribute among The Pitt
News, WPGH Radio -(or a
new FM station if approved by

the university), Backspace, and
the Owl. Lastyear, the media
groups received a combined
total of approximately $35,000;
—The Board of Governors
for the Pitt Union Program
Council would receive 35
percent of the fee or approx-/
imately $192,000. Appro-
ximately.$75,000 of this total
must be used for programming
major concerts. PUPC received
approximately $110,_000 last
year; and _
-The Allocations Committe
would receive 40 percent of the
fee, or $275,000, to fund the

Proposal Accepted To IncreaseStudeht Activities Fee 1

remainder of the student
organizations. The committee
distributed only $130,000 to
these same groups last year.
The proposal stipulates that
the three-year PUPC contract
must be boided by the SGB, the
director of student activities
and the vice chancellor for
student affairs, and that a
board of governors must be
formed to replace the contract.
“The Pitt Union Program
Council will devise a consti-
tution to include a policy-
making, budgetary board to be
representative of the broad and

varied interests of the Oakand ,
.campus of the University of
Pittsburgh,‘ and shall have a
minimum of three represent-
atives appointed by the Student
Government Board,” accord-
_ing to the proposal.

The Media and Publications
Board will also be required to
change, according to’ the
proposal, by adding two
students, appointed by 2 the '
SGB, to represent the student .

V body. The board will serve as a
budgetary body and will
approve all advertising rates.

For Leaving Band Home

$3»

4.

By TERESA SOKOL
. Pitt News Staff Writer

. High cost and the fact that the
Pitt "Band would not be performing
the halftime show at the Fiesta
Bowl on Christmas day were the
determining factors in not sending
the band to’ the bowl game, said
Jack E. Freeman, vice chancellor of

administration for the university.
Freeman pointed out that the
issue of whether totake the band to
a bowl game always comes up.

He ‘saidthat since the Fiesta Bowl ’

is a -“limited income”. bowl, the
ﬁnancial aspects of new revenue
for the university were uncertain..

Freeman broke down the ex-
penses for the bowl.

“The Fiesta Bowl committee has
led us to believe that we should"
receive about $342,000, but. we
have to take expenses out of this
amount,” he said.

The bulk of the expenses go to
the football team and all necessary
personnel, including doctors,
trainers and press corps, Freeman
noted. This adds up to about
$244,000, and he estimates that

._this price is for 200-250 people. The
team will probably leave December
19 . and return the --day after
Christmas, he said. V

But Freeman noted that if the
game isn’t a sell-out, Pitt’s share of
the net revenue couldbe consider-
ably, less. This happened with last
year’s Tangerine Bowl,V,_ which left
the university about $50,000 in the
hole, Freeman said. ' V

His office explored every avenue
to "determine if itpwas feasible to

would be needed to “fly the band

ﬁnancial decision.” This amount,
he said, included a chartered

plane, food, and bus transportation‘

while in Arizona.

 Freeman Slates Reasons

“The band is loyal and works‘

hard, but it was necessary to make

‘ a judgment call and give them a

reasonablepbut smaller share of the

revenuesfrom the Fiesta Bowl,”

said‘ Freeman.
According to a spokesman for

Stan Richards, who is director of

the half time activities for the
Fiesta Bowl this year, thelprogram
for "the halftime activities had been
worked on about two‘ months in
advance of the bowl bids.

' Steve Cleniker, an associate of
Richards, stated that with the bids
coming so late, the TV networks
needed a commitment of a halftime
program and the bowl could not
afford - to have bands from the
opposing teams cancel out.

This year’s halftime program
includes an all-Arizona high school
band and a professional stage
band, Cleniker added. '

The University of Aizona, Pitt’s
opponent in the Fiesta Bowl, will
have about six minutes of playing

time for. its hand, said Jack Lee,

band director for the University of
Arizona. Lee said Arizona’s band
had been invied as ‘it sometimes
had been in the past because it is a
local band. ’ A

I

" Also, there have been occasions ‘

when other bands have not" shown
up because of the Christmas date.
Many of the Pitt Band members
_stat_ed, that going_to a bowl would
have been a reward for the hard
work they put in during the‘ football
season, and wonder what effectnot

" going to the Fiesta Bowl will ‘have

on the band's recruitment pro-
gram.‘ .

Being at the game to support the
Panthers is also important to the
band, according to drum major

/Ken Smith. » V _

' “We can make a visiting stadium
awfully friendlyto help out team.
We feel that they are leaving a
loyal following behind,” he said.

, Both Smith and_ Pam Zadjel, who
has been a member of the band for
three years, wonder what this
decisionwill do to Pitt’s image.

Zadjel said, “I can’t believe that
they wouldn’t want any support.
‘I thought taking the band was all
part ofthe pageantry of the bowl-
,to be" there. to representv and

encourage our tear‘r1,'.v”‘ . -4

 New Pres I

By WALTER R. WATSON

Pitt News Staff Writer
“We’re aiming toward fund-
amentally working as a team,” said

. SGB President-elect Bill Abraham

when speaking about the. newly-
elected Student Government
Board. A

In a recent interview, Abraham
talked about his feelings in regard
to the’ unique position he finds
himself in as new SGB president.

“I think I have the ability and
leadership qualities necessary to
handle the job. I admit that I lack
the actual experience or insight
that already being in office would
give me,” he said. “I feel that by

‘ working with the board members,

I’ll learn a lot from them and I'll

acquire the information and tech-

niques needed to help run an

cefﬁcient .student government.” 4
High on the list of priorities for

of

“insuring a fair and equitable
allocations» process by having
strong communications with all
student "groups, and through
working closely in cooperation with
the allocations committee.”

Abraham went on to say, “Two
things died on past government
board agendas. They are:
the cafeteria food problem, andthe
campus bus route.”

Another project slated for board
action is the Galanski-Abraham
proposal which included:

1) An increase in the student

activities fee;

2) The allocations of funding for

major concerts some of which

would be held off-campus;

3) An increase in allocations to
campus publications and media,

Union renovations.

With the proposed voiding of the
present Pitt Union Program
Council with student government,
the addition of a board of governors
to aid in the decision-making
process of programming, Abraham
feels it will “allow a broad and
varied student representation, as
well as a greater flexibility in
programming.’ ' -

When asked where he thought

the student activities fee should go, _

he said that he felt it important to
bring in programming that would
attract more student participation.
“I think it’s imperative that the
student activities fee be raised to
$12—to bring us ﬁnancially back on
track. With that measure, we’ll not
only be able to ’ put out more
concerts, but we’ll be capable of
funding the operations of the
proposed open-air FM radio
station, the expansion of campus-

wide media and publications,‘ and
the expansion of programs in
general.

We can help provide not only for
the survival of student organiza-
tions on the whole, but enhancing
of the organizations a; well,
thereby offering more things to all
students. In other words, making
the programs more accessible to
students,” Abraham said.

“A student activitiesptask force
will have toapprove a ﬁnal form of
the plan. If they approve it, the
plan will be presented on the
agenda of one of next term’s SGB
meetings,” said Abraham. “From
there, it would be presented to the
Student Affairs Advisory Com-

' mittee, and sometime in February,

the university’s Board of Trustees
would consider the plan. If a
referendum is recommended by the
Board of Trustees, it would

probably reach us between Feb-
ruary and May. We'd resubmit a
new proposal, and the process
would start all over again."

“I’m enthused about this year’s
projects and have faith in nine
members of the _board. It’s
important that we work as a team.
I’m not just talking about the
board, but students in general.
There is a lot of potential on this
campus. The sky’s the limit‘ as to
what the students can do. What we
have is a reciprocal relationship
with students that we’re trying to
strengthen,” said Abraham. “We-N

need the students’ support to get“?

programs approved that they’ll
hopefully take advantage of, and
the students need a formal body to
get programs, or at least funding,
approved through the admin-
istration. That’s where we come
1n.”

  Senior Citizens Rock end Roll

People who grew up listening to
the music of Earl Hines, Tommy
Dorsey, and Eubie Blake, probably
would take a dim view of rock and
disco music. Right? Wrong!
At least it’s wrong to assume this
about the member of Vintage, Inc.,
a Senior Adult Center located in
East Liberty. They listened avidly
(some even danced) to a Sunday
afternoon concert arranged by
Bobby Davis, manager of the
popular Pittsburgh Clubs Encore I
and II, and the Vintage Drama
Group. Brenda Jones, a local
singer and three young musicians
entertained the audience with hits
such as “I will Survive” and “Main
Squeeze”. ,

Local tap dancer, Sazie Williams
and Mark Tierno, master of card
tricks, also entertained. The
audience loved it, and had some

UNIQUE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY‘

thought-provoking comments. A
70-year-old woman mused, “The
more things change, the more‘ they
stay the same. Everyone sings
about love and they always will.”
Others seemed to think that today’s
music is based on foundations built
by the musicians of today. “The
ragtime of my day encouraged
people to experiement with new
and different kinds of music,”
affirmed an elderly gentlemen in
between sets. A retired radio
singer didn’t say anything; she just
hummed along, no doubt re-living
her own musical past, Later, she
did her own version of the latest
disco dance.

has started work on what he says
will be an $800,000 “docu-drama”

Kennedy would be

The movie, if completed, will

"December 17 concert.

' g Robin Lubic. Asst. News Editor
Mark Holan, Entertainment Editor

» .. ]iom.Palmer. Asst. Entertainment Editor

Who’s ‘N ext?

For“many of the rock fans who attend Monday
night’s Who concert performed in Cincinnati’s
Riverfront Coliseum, a grim reminder of the
senseless tragedy that occured could be found on the
shoes of some who survived the deranged rush for
general admission seats. Blood, the dried blood of
those killed and injured, could be worn for the
fortunate to see.

That the promoters of the concert could sell nearly

8,000 (half capacity) “festival seating” tickets, where
bearers are not assigned places .but rather get

whatever seat they can, was not only a foolish

mistake but an action so irresponsible it boggles the ,

mind. Surely the promoters knew the W-ho, an
extremely popular band and one that recently has
toured infrequently, would draw a large, indeed
frenzied crowd of fans. Eleven of those fans are
dead, the victims of senseless planning, mindless
behavior and old-fashioned human selfishness.
“Now comes a predictable backlash to the

A Cincinnati incident. The mayor of Providence, R.I.,

Vincent A. Cianci Jr., was successful in getting his
city’s Civic Center authorities .to cancel the Who’s
Mayor Cianci and other
Providence officials miss the significance of what
happened in Cincinnati. ‘

The cancellation of the concert implies that
somehow the Who was responsible for the ll deaths,
that somehow the actions of the crazed masses can be
directly related to the band. Rather, the causes of the

deaths can be linked to other people and

. organizations, involved in the concert’s logistics.

We have already excoriated the promoters for their
mindless use of the tickets. Perhaps they should have
looked to Pittsburgh one night earlier for guidance.
Last Sunday, the Who performed for more than
17,000 fans in our Civic Arena and the concert came
off without incident. The promoter here, Danny
Kresky Enterprises, has a policy of not selling more
than ‘ten percent of the tickets to his concerts on a
festival-seating basis. Further, Kresky Enterprises
worked with the Civic Arena management and the
City Police to assure a sufficient amount of security
for both the band and the fans was available.

Kresky Enterprises did its job, and the result was.
an outstanding concert and a pleasant experience for- .

nearly all the fans who turned out. In Cincinnati, a
bizarre tragedy occured. Could it have happened if
about half the house was not general admission?"

Almost certainly not. With nearly all tickets sold-

on a reserved basis, there would not have been such a
large crowd of peoplearriving early to try and race to
the best seats once the doors opened. A" considerably
smaller amount of fans would have been standing out
in the cold for hours, overly anxious to get indoors,
and fewer would have been spurred on by the
courage and uninhibited behavior that results from
alcohol and drug use.

Not to be excused, of course, are the many people
who stormed the Coliseum once -the doors (and,
unbelievably, it has been reported that perhaps only
two doors were opened) were unlocked. Such
behavior has always beenhard to ‘control, but anyone

Page 6—Friday, December 7, 1979

without the common sense to realize what that kind
of action could do, no matter how long he has been
out in the cold, should not be out on the streets.

There has also been speculation that some people
died because the force of bodies pushing forward
even before the doors opened was sufficient to crush
or asphixiate them. Considering what we do know

about what happened Monday, we are not as
shocked by this piece of speculation as we probably
should be. '

People have always been and. must continue to be
responsible for much, if not all, of their own actions-.
It would be nice, but also realize that no special event
be it a rock concert, football game or bingo game, is
an ‘occasion for a type of behavior that is grossly
unacceptable on any other occasion.

The actions of the people Monday night were, of
course, reprehensible. The subsequent actions of
Mayor Cianci was just plain silly and akin to banning
cars after a particularly bad wreck. Both the fans
and the mayor should have known better. For once,
Monday morning quarterbacking and harsh-second-
guessing may be of some use. Almost certainly now,
no promoter will again soon go the large-scale
festival seating route in planning future concerts.» It
is incredible that 11 people had to die to expose what
should ‘have been an obvious danger. The promoter
and the people that caused and survived the stampede
now know the results of their irresponsible actions.
We only hope what they know will become common
knowledge and people will, finally, begin to act

accordingly. Perhaps the blood on some survivor’sf

shoes will become society’s handwriting on the wall.

Scrooge of New Yeaii’sSees No Reason to Celebrate

About this time you're probably
expecting a nice little letter
decrying either the increasing
commercialization of Christmas or
the fact that this year's anniversary

I of Christ's birth should again see

the world royally fouled up, Iran
and all. However, I wish to
disgress for a moment to write
about what I ﬁnd a disagreeable
by-product by the year's most
pleasant holiday. ~

I am the Ebenezer Scrooge of

day.

Now. mind you. it’s not because I .
Quite the
contrary. And it's not because I
don't enjoy a good time.

However, New Year's is one day,
that, for no particular reason at all,
everyone is demanded to have a
good time. There is nothing to
commemorate; no historical. or
religious event; except that the
year has arbitarily ended. And
probably ended on a downswing,
with you burdened by Christmas

debts and in fresh receipt of your

Form 1040's. .
Which leads me to my next
objection about New Year's; it is a
dramatic ariticlimax to the ever-
Christmas season.

buildup, a sharp comedown is
natural afterwards.

Perhaps it is the solemnity, the
spirituality of Christmas" that
demands New Year’s. For New
Year's is a status holiday. At the
beginning of the year we are well
reminded how we stand. The rich

hotel ballrooms, spending for all
it's . worth. In contrast. the
not-so-rich will celebrate in their
homes, if ‘at all. What a comfort to
the wealthy this must be, after a lot
of fuss over a poor mother and her
Child! And let's not discuss the
other side of it all-the unspoken
rule that if you don't kiss someone
at the stroke of twelve you love life
is in vicious neediof ‘repair!

To some starting out a new year

The pnly New Year's I ever liked
was the time-cl-was bold enough to
defy tradition, and, spent the
evening watching Jon" Voight in
“The Odessa File” in a nearly
empty cinema. The flick wasn’t the
best, but it generated a little
suspense, a mental state preferable
to irritation caused by watching the
game of social
played at many New Year's parties
I've seen. Let's see. there are
several good. movies coming out
around Christmas this year.

Or better yet, I hereby make a
suggestion that we celebrate New
Year's in February-with the
Chinese. The Chinese New Year
has more character, can be
celebrated in the street at the price
of a box of ﬁreworks. and does not

have the disadvantage of being an

anticlimax to Christmas. The

an official of that office. He stated
a number of points as toll why we
were not going, including the fact
that the band would NOT be given
ANY time to play. at halftime.
Although still disappointed, I
understood their position. After
considering this answer for a while.
I thought back to all of the bowl

decided to do some checking on my

Committee in Phoenix and the
reply was that although the

Universities were not required to .

bring a band, each university
would be allotted six minutes of
halftime for their ban . This is in
direct conflict to the report the
Office of Planning and Budget was

giving us. If the University wants .

to look like a minor league college

T Letters A R .

Pitt’s ‘Difficulties’ Leaves BandHome For The Holidays I

.”‘~.

This is a letter in response to
recent happenings concerning the
University of Pittsburgh’s “sup-
posed ﬁnancial difficulties” in
sending the Pitt Band to. the Fiesta
Bowl.

A return phone call from Stan
Richards, the producer of the
half-time and pre-game shows for
the Fiesta Bowl, revealed a -few
notable details. Mr. Richards told
us that no official letter was sent to
the University regarding the band
going to Arizona. The letter
inviting the band to the game was
included in the invitation package
given to Pitt by the bowl
committee. ,

The letter explicitly stated.‘ that
Pitt had ﬁve calender days to
repond to this invitation. After ﬁve
days, Mr. Richards was told that
“no response” was given. He told
us that it, is too late for the Pitt
Band to go to Arizona. Absolutely
no time remains available at
pre-game or half-time for the band
to perform; He also said‘ that he\
regrets that no cancellations of the
bands scheduled to perform could
be made.

We feel that it is very regrettable
that Pitt accepted the invitation last
monthpand that the band learned

this past week that they were not
going. We were told that it was a
question of money and Pitt could
not afford to fly and keep us there.
The ﬁgures we were told was that it
would cost $85,000 to send us,
and Pitt could not afford to send us.
Pitt received hundred of thousands
of dollars this season alone from
T.V. rights at the Penn State game,
Syracuse game and Navy game and
that the estimated cost to send the
band had jumped up to $112,000.
Isn’t it amazing that the cost of
inflation’ skyrocketed over 31
percent overnite?????

The band has been practicing
since the last week of,.August and
practice continues throughout the
fall term; We practice from 6:15 till
8:15 on‘ Monday, Tuesday ‘and
Thursday. On Saturday morn-
ings, we are often up in time
enough to see the sun rise-.
When we leave for the away
games, we leave in the middle of
the night for a long, tedious and
uncomfortable bus ride. The band
members are all volunteers and
receive no scholarships and just a
half a credit a year (if you chose to
register for and if you carry less
than 18 credits) for such dedica-

tion; A bowl game is a reward not

only for the football players but
also for all those people who help
to make the season a success.

We feel that the appreciation and
thanks we deserve for such loyalty
and dedication are long overdue.

We feel that it is disgusting that
the-buck has been passed for so
long and that we were the last to
ﬁnd out from the Budgeting Affairs
ofﬁce that we were no allowed to
go. We feel it is a sad situation that
we had to take it upon ourselves
last night to call to Arizona and talk
to Mr. Richards personally to ﬁnd
out the truth.

general theme. I have read other
letters sent in from members of the
Anti-Imperialist Student Union and
as a student I felt that it would not
be useful to respond. However,
come January I will be installed as
a member of the Student Govern-
ment Board and, in that light, I
wish to examine Mr. Hess’
position. Unfortunately, Mr. Hess’
diatribe is punctured with many
vague and loose “insights,” that
his position is not clear in my mind:
Is he writing his letter to sincerely
point out the inequities -he sees, or
is he writing his letter to see his
name in the paper?

If it is the former, then Mr. Hess
needs to acquire writing skills ifihe
is to put an argument, with any
basis, together. Examples of this
(examples should be made when
making statements) include his
saying that the grading system
discriminates against working peo—
ple. How, Mr. Hess? He states that
“Many of us” crammed for the
mid-terms and now for the ﬁnals.
But who is this “many of us?” Is
“us” the Anti-Imperialist Student
Union members, or tne students at

Bard Qf The “GEE . A
The Cardboards: Avant-g

By BRYAN A.C. KELLY R

“In the future. The Cardboards.”
If you have-seen this poster then you
may wonder who they are and what
they are about. The Cardboards are a
new Pittsburgh group whose genre lies
somewhere among punk‘ avant-garde
jazz, and Berlin, Cabaret of the’
Twenties.

The Cardboards began in
Pittsburgh’s underground music scene
in the winter of 1979. The band’s_
members came together as a result of
their common discontent with what
they saw as a lack of original music
being created in this city. They began
playing at private parties and have
since played such venues as Phase III,
Oakland’s Decade,_ C-MU campus,
and the, Lion Walk in Oakland and
Northside’s Mattress Factory.

Max Haste is "the band's lead singer.
His stage presence is nearly
schizophrenic, first\ calm and
charming, next raving and hysterical.
His lyrics are clever and clear. Ron
Solo plays the three synthesizers. His
spacey melodies may be the music
trend of the future. Keith Teeth
creates the hooks with his catchy saxo-
phone riffs and hesays, “I like a few
select jazz players. Post Ornette Cole-
man, Steven Lace, and Rosco
Mitchell.” He also cites influences as
XTC, Wire, and the Contortions.

Bill Bored, percussionist of Puke
fame, prov.ides...the .backbeat and the
recently added Miss Shapen
occasionally sings backup vocals.

“I like a band that has a sense of

humor, the Germs and Black Randy,
for example,” Bored explained.

' “I met Keith at C-MU and Bill and I
are writers for the New Magazine,” a
Pittsburgh punk rock farizine. “We
had been following new music so we
decided to try something new
ourselves,’ ’ Haste said.

When asked what his influences were
he said,” I like to play Dizzy Gillespie
records at high speeds. That’s what
makes me happy.” 1

Bill Bored joined the Cardboards
when, “Keith and Max realized they
wanted someone todevelop with them,
not an ex-drummer from- a symphony
orchestra,” Haste said.

The Cardboards best feature is their
ability to create stylistically original
pieces. The bands tunes run the gamut
from the delightfully bouncy ditties
about Three Mile Island to the
seriously surrealistic “Ether Jazz.”
Radically original, the Cardboards are
never boring. ’

Because they are different and‘
original, the Cardboards have to work
harder for acceptance. They are

attracting new followers with their.
showmanship and ability. Keith Teeth »

- serious. We started for fun but since

people like us for one reason or
anotherwe have kept at it seriously.”

They are not just a band to ‘drink to, .

they are a band to react with. The
songsare so humorous and imaginative
they compel the audience to think, not
just tap their feet. Not many people sit

at a Cardboard show. Once a night,

Haste leads a pogo line, a latter day
congo line, around wherever they are
performing. A .

Perhaps because they are so visually
captivating, the group has also been
captured on film. Pittsburgh

Filmmaker S. Beroes is featuring them, .

along with other new Pittsburgh
bands, the Shakes, the Puke, and Hans
Brinker and the Dykes, in an upcoming
film called “Debt Begins at 20.”
Funded in part by the National Council
on the Humanities, the film is rumored
to be about a one night stand involving
a punk rocking couple with Bill Bored
as the male lead.

Y YYYVYVYYYYVYVYYYYYVVYVYYVVVVYYVYYYVYVYY

The wide repertoire of the Card-
boards include such titles as, “Pretend
You’re Mind is a Dress—”...and
change it,” “I Hate Disease,”'—it
ma-kes me sick,” “The Guitar
Annoys,” and “Breakfast -ID.” They
also do period pieces like “General
Custard”-“.'.".‘y'o'1’1’re dead,”
“Skylab,” -and “The Phase III
Boogie” along with somber social

commentary, “Vietnam Amputee”

and “No War This Week.”

; ‘If you are thinking about starting a
’ new band yourself you might well con-

sider these suggestions. “I urge‘
anyone to -go ahead. Don’t beafraid
of success or failure and rely on your
intuitions,” and “Start Now,” said
Max and Bill respectively.

So if you are bored with Boston, fed .

up with Foreigner, convulse at country
rock, or despise disco and want to hear
a sample of what your local artistsare
producing, get out and see the
Cardboards.

Featherworkin g Art Exhibition at Carnegie Institute 

By JANICE SCHULER

This featherworking exhibition at
Carnegie Institute’s Museum of
Natural History will attract Sunday
anthropologists and art lovers alike.
Each feather object has an awesome
beauty and is rich in historical and
cultural significance. There are some
objects that date back to 2,500 B.C.;
but most of them were made b‘y a
variety of cultures around the turn of

the century. The 250 some objects in -

the show were originally made to
enhance beauty, secure wealth or
manipulate the spirits. Some continue
to be made for those purposes but most
are produced for sale to tourists.

There is a myth from the Amazon
that explains how birds got their
beautiful color: Long ago, all birds

, were dull and dingy. Then they joined

forces with men to kill the giant, evil
rainbow serpent. After a terrible
battle, they succeeded in "defeating the
snake, and a miracle happened: each
bird became the colors of that part of
the serpent it held in its mouth.

The creativity of the craftsmen has a
highly sophisticated sensitivity to
texture, color and weighting.
colors are lusturous, irridescent, gem
dark and mysterious and
sometimes sinister. The textures can‘be
sensuous, arrogant or whimsical.
Shaving the shaft, or vein of the
feather was one technique used to

A Look at the Disco Era —

By GEORGE SHANER
From about 1975 on, the most active
branch of popular music has been

. disco. Not that you could have missed

it, unless of course, you had exiled

- yourself to a deserted island.

Hundreds of. discos opened up
across the country 'to an ever widening
audience. Millions of dollars were
poured into the production and
promotion of disco records. In some
markets, all-disco radio stations scored
for themselves large advances_ in the
ratings. Finally, disco was covered, in
one form or another, by all branches of

 the mass media; from television to
almost yearly covers on magazines‘

such as Newsweek, Time, and even
Rolling Stone. ~ ’ -

Of late"though, there has been talk
that disco is fading; that itls a fad that
has finally burned’ out. Some say it’s
because people are-tiredrof the 4/4 beat

and are going ‘back to their old music.‘

Others point to the anti-disco
movement, a development "that was
most vividly symbolizediby the summer
riot at Shea Stadium this year. Some
critics claim that the New Wave’s first
bloom of success in this country ‘is
offering an alternative to disco and is
taking away disco’s adherents.
Considering these surface trends,
where does one seek out the roots of
disco’s much talked about decline?
When one looks at how discos and
disco radio stations are doing, one sees
little sign of total collapse. Those
discos that have gone out of business

were the ones that were poorly
‘managed or outdone by newer discos. »
‘The disco radio stations that have

fallen were defeated by the lack of an

- established audience in their region.

Those stations that have an established
audience are still doing well, though
the initial burst of excitement, seems to
have worn off. All of this is a matter

make a_curl or change the intrinsic
shape. Peacock feathers were
sometimes spun ‘with silk to make
irridescent embroidery thread.
Feathers were often used as inlays or
merely glued to the bodies of
tribesmen. V .

There are finger masks, nose
ornaments, shaman’s paraphernalia,
ritual clothing and a wide range of
headdresses. Being at eye‘ level, the
headdress‘ offers ‘the greatest
possibilities for creating unususal
sculptural forms. They were primarily
designed to intensify dance
movements, usingweighted tail
feathers to create springy bouyant

ornaments. That would bounce with

the slightest movement of the wearer’s
head. In New Guinea, a headdress was
designed specifically to demonstrate
the strength and agility of the dancers.
To perform this step, the man vibrated
their heads very rapidly in a
performance intended to win the
admiration of their female audience.
Circular headdresses suggested
spiritual energy radiating from the
head like a halo.

Some of the body ornaments were
made to enhance sexual attraction.
The physical beauty displayed was
linked with economic success and

spiritual savvy. When the dance rituals ’

were carried out properly, the spirits
were said to congregate in a man’s hair

collapse. If this is true, where do we
find the much publicized decline of
disco? In the sales of records and the
recent fortunes of the record business.
Most'of the chart action for disco
music occurs on the single charts; for
every successful disco album, there
seems to be five successful singles.
Further,’ relatively few stars in the rock

sense of commanding a solid audience .

have appeared. Sure, there is Donna
Summer, the Bee Gees, Chic, and, The
Village People; how many more can
you think of though that have become
big and held a large audience? _
Compare these trends to how the
record companies do business. These
companies depend on the’ sale of
albums to keep their op,erations,alive;
singles were used to sell albums;
Record companies also depend a great
deal on the sale of what is _called
catalog. Catalog is simply the sales _a
b.and’s catalog of albums builds up,
and it can bevery considerable. For
example, The Doors’ catalog of

albums sells the equivalent of a gold ‘'

record every year. .

This catalog naturally depends on an
artist maintaining a steady output of
albums over the years and keeping a
loyal audience. Disco hasn’t really
developed this yet. i

There is a parallel to this but the
record business seems to have.
forgotten it. -

In the early to mid 60’s, there were
relatively few important stars and a
mass of short-lived acts who had their
brief taste of fame and then
disappeared. Singles were the

predominant means of selling music ‘

and albums were seen essentially as

V compilations. In another neat parallel,

. producers were also considered stars

the way disco producers can be now;

to help him achieve his desired goals.
Feathers were so important to these

‘men that they would trade their rifles

and machetes for a feather headband.
This is the first traveling exhibition
to come to the Carnegie Institute in
The show originated at
the Field Museum of Natural History
in Chicago and will be going to four
other museums across the country after

A Phaﬁe on the Downslide

Moroder’s and Cerrone’s names can
sell albums. This is not to say the disco
boom has not produced successful
concept albums, it’s. just that the single
has ‘predominated in sales.

All this represented a come-to-life
replay of a past the record companies
could no longer handle.

Add to this situation, then, the
accepted fact commented on by ”one
Radcliffe Joe, in the November 17,-

1979, edition of ‘Billboard that the’ I

success of a song in a disco _club does
not necessarily translate, "into record

sales. He says that people go to discos i
I mainly to entertain -themselves in the

overall environment, not to listen to
the music. I’ ‘I _ -
Combine this unfortunate fact of
sales life with the high productionand
promotion costs of Disco material and

.it’s no surprise that the record

companies ran into trouble.

However, if the companies had
marketed their. product intelligently,
they might have not had as much
trouble as they did. "Dr. John Perikal,
a media-music sociologist, says_ the

_ record companies aimed disco product

at a predominantly male audience, and
the companies gave these people the
idea of “sexy” packaging.
market though, was predominantly
female, and they found the “sexy”
packaging “sexist.’-’ The women
wanted romance, not bondage.
Comparable mistakes in marketing
cost the record business in _a big way.
With the return of old line super
stars like Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood
Mac, The Eagles, and Stevie Wonder
to the charts the record companies can
now begin to rebuild. Add relative
newcomers. like Blondie, The Knack
and Tom Petty, among many others;
plus recycled stars like Bob Dylan and
Charlie Daniels

its completion in Pittsburgh on

February 29, 1980. Phyllis Rabineau,   '

curator in charge of this show says that

this exhibition is like a dream come -

“For a number of years,” she says, 

“I had a dream of walking into a room

- filled with feathers. You might say this

exhibit

is a fulfillment of that
fantasy.” ' " '

got -its beach head via stagnation" in
rock, does it have a. long term future
~ now that the rockers are on the
upturn? Another parallel can give you
the answer: Disco, like the rock of the
late 60's is on the verge of fragmenting

and making the jump from fad.to4- A

genre. . .
“Disco” artists like Donna Summer
and The Bee Gees are diversifying their
stance to reach a wider audience.- In
particular, Summer seems to be trying
to cover all the bases in pop. Funk, as
purveyed by George Clinton, Earth,
Wind and Fire, and Rick James is

making continued inroads into all the

charts. Most ironicallythough, the

disco might be the way a large audience: -

gets into contact with the New Wave!

The process began with Blondie’»s it  

novelty hit “Heart Of Glass” and The

Talking Heads’ “Take Me To The, 
River.’.’ Further New Wave acts like 1-

Ian Dury and Lene Lovich have. also

made inroads into the discos, while the

B52’s and James White and his varied
bands are making dance music with-
out losing their credibility.
there is a pool of disco DJ’s on the
West Coast that have been adding
bands like the Buzzcocks and XTC to
their playlists, bands that were not
intended to be danced to in the disco
sense in the first place. It’s' amusing to

see one genre of pop 'music (disco)  .
supposedly :-

introduce another
antithetical form (New Wave) to a
previously ignorant audience.

As the 80’s roll around, disco is in
the process of solidifyingits stance and
evolving ‘beyond a popular obscenity.

By 1985, you might not hear about .
.disco in the sense of a narrow

description, you might mean dance
music, period. And why not? Rock

ignored dance music and pop too long   it

for its own good; it’s just that this time

i Decade.

In several short weeks, the 1970's will
be over. Another ten year block of time

In the ensuing
months of the new decade, a plethora of

3- books and documentaries will attempt to

analyze the past decade. Much has

‘I  already begun to appear on -newsstands

and television screens.

Like everyone else, Showcase feels a
need to somehow document the ’7Q’s in
our field of interest-entertainment.
Besides, it is kind of fun. .

What made it difficult for us was the
fact that, like our readership, we were
still young in 1970. For example, if you

 ,_ are twenty now you were only ten years
‘ ‘ old at the beginning of this decade.

Thus, you probably would not have been

- buying many albums going to concerts, or

seeing movies. The majority of students
probably did not become actively involved
in‘ seeking their own entertainment until
about the middle of the decade.
Nevertheless, we have attempted to
pick some of the best entertainmeent
offerings, in various categories, of the
’70’s. The listings are not rated from best
to worst. Surely you will agree with some

others. We hope, however, you find them
all thought-provoking.

If anything at all was noteworthy
enought to single out the Seventies as an

cinema emerge and capture millions of
audiences, more so than it had ever done

concerned themselves maily with est-

the last ten years gave television its

boring. But really, in retrospective there
were many positive trends that developed
in music during the 1970’s. The decade
seemed to get off to a good start but then
a bottoming out period developed, but

‘Clarence Darrow’-

One Man Historical Drama

By THOMAS PALMER
Clarence Darrow

Once Hugh Rose approached the

‘ judge’s bench in the courtroom stage

lawyer, Clarence Darrow. And not

man who is the focal point of the one-

“Clarence Darrow.” -' A

when he began practicing law. He
moves quickly through his early years,
talking about his association with

attempted to uphold through his
practice. Darrow wasclearly a man
with firm ideas and beliefs who stood

We know, from the monologue, that
Darrow was very much in love with his
first wife, but her character and his
involvement with her is minimal in the
drama. The real desire for Darrow is

or make it work in the way that it was
intended. ’

The second act moves more into the

Theatre Express Opens Its Season With ‘Dynamite’  

By MARK HOLAN ‘
Dynamite Tonight '
Directed by William Turiier
Theatre Express

“Dynamite Tonight” begins with a
bang (literally) and ends with a blind,
maimed soldier saying good night to a
bunker full of dead _ comrades and
enemies.‘ In between, the production
carries through its 70-minute running
time with a variety of songs and dance
done in a bizarre, burlesque "fashion.

« The play, which occurs ‘during an
unspecified war at an unspecified time,
revolves around a Captain (Peter
Matthey)’, his‘; seargeant
Ellerbrock), «a carefree soldier, named
Smiley (Ken Stirbl) and aeprisoner. (Jed

’ Harris). The Captain is a comic -per-‘

sonification of that all-too-.fa’m'iliar

(John-

military logic that wars are necessary to
preserve and maintain peace. ' The
Seargeant, however, has other opinions
and makes an incongruous, and funny,
SidC'kiCk.

“Dynamite Tonight” features ,the
premiere of a new two-piano adaptation
of William Bol'com’s score by Michael
S. Roth. Coupled with Arnold Wein-
stein’s witty words and vaudeville
choreography, the classic statement
that “war is hell” is taken to the
zaniest and most outrageous. extreme.

 This point is perhaps best illustrated

when, about half-wa-y through the

' P1‘0dl1C‘li0f1. a power failure leaves the

bunker-and the audience-in total
darkness. The Captain, the Seargeant,
Smiley and even the prisoner forget‘
about the tensions of war and‘ sing
about the death of a day. , But when the

,‘,Common Knowledge:’ iMu|ti-Media from Studio

_ . Common Knowledge
‘' Directed by Charlotte MacArthur
V ‘Studio Theater

By TOM McGINTY

The University of Pittsburgh Studio
Theatre presented what was billed as
“an original multi-media event”
called, appropriately, “Common
Knowledge. ’ ’

Truly a’unique effort, “Common
Knowledge” was well done and quite
entertaining. A fast paced format kept
-the performance running smoothly,
while the quick but simple set changes
and lighting caught the audience’s

attention and, to a point, involved
them in the show. The main action was
the reciting of various news stories by
the performers, many which were
unusual, to say the least, and many
that were very funny.‘ A few
Confederates were surreptitiously
located among the audience and
occasionally blurted out one of the
seemingly endless flow of news stories.

The cast was comprised" of ten
capable performers, five males and five
females, none of which had a “lead”
role. They complimented each other
very well and gave a clearly excellent

display of the oddities that otherwise

‘ go unnoticed. “Common Knowledge”

was arranged and directed by Charlotte
Winburn MacArthur.

The most interesting feature of the
show was the usage of several media
methods both individually and
simultaneously. A film by Tom Glebe
periodically glowed from a screen that
was conveniently situated above and
behind the left side of the Studio
Theatre stage. Electronic music
pervaded the show often enough to
become an integral part of the
performance. Dancing, video effects
and slides were also utilized with the

brief stories which the program specifi-
cally perports are factual.

The performers, the_crew and the

director should be commended for the .

fine quality of “Common
Knowledge.” This ‘performance
showed an interesting and thoroughly

entertaining attempt at divergence ..

from the often staid format of studio
theater, “Common Knowledge” is
funny enough to causea stifled yuk to
slip out more than once. It is also
serious at times and occasionally

stories were spread out at different,

times and re-emerged later. The multi-
media show is an enjoyable escape
from the ordinary. '

By EDWARD YORK

What the sixties, beer and Bluto did to
Faber College in “Animal House,” the
seventies, pot, and a girl named Riff
Randel try to do to her alma mater, Vince
Lombardi High, in “Rock’n’Roll High
School.” Randel is a rock’n’roll junkie

M who believesthe world rotates at 33 1/3

rpm and is rarely seen without a tape or

’, record machine supplying her fix.

She is Lombardi High’s leading promoter
of rock’n’roll, and when the school board
elects to replace the old principal (now a
blithering incompetent reduced to spoon-
feeding) with a’ disciplinarian set [upon

= stopping rock’n'roll, the stage is set for

confrontation.

A cellophane plot and stick-on _

characters ensue, intertwined among a
half-dozen songs, by the _ Ramones.

Take any mid-sixties beach movie, mix
the sand to make concrete, turn summer
break into_fall term, and toughen up

’ Frankie Avalon to make Joey Ramone,

and youhave “Rock’n’Roll High School.”
It is rock’n’rol1 versus the world again,
and the music remains champion.

. But there is something that pulls the
ﬁlm through. It could be the inanity of
the screenplay. Writers Rich Whitely,
Russ Dronch and Joseph McBride took
great pains to make Director Allan

, Arkush’s and Joe Dante's story appeal to

cretins. Or it may be the striking
resemblance of tough principal Evelyn

Togar to Frank_ N. Furter of “Rocky .

Horror Picture Show” fame. (Try to catch

’ the actress’s name on ‘the trailing credits‘, '

if you think you are quick enough).

Maybe the surprise quality of the jokes
and sight- gags allows the movie to
survive. At one point, Principal Togar

produces a Rockometer to prove her
theory that rock’n’roIl is dangerous.
The,machine measures the output"of huge
speakers surrounding a mouse cage in the
school’s lab. As Togar increases the
volume, the Rockometer rises past Donny
and Marie, beyond‘Peter Frampton and
Led Zepplin, to peak at the threshold of
the Ramones. Suddenly the mouse cage
is engulfed in smoke——thel rodent has
exploded. Ms. Togar remarks con-
clusively, “Notice the loss of hearing.”
Not a fine example of empirical reasoning
but; visually, very funny. The movie
aboundsswith humor. that belongs in the
“you had to be there” category, and this
keeps the 90-minute show moving. g

The actors are unknowns, but you may--
recognize faces. P.J. Soles plays Riff
Randel, Dey Young is Kate Rambeau,
Riff’s straight school friend who writes
for Scientiﬁc American, splits protons in
her basement (only to later learn the ways
of rock’n’roll) and concludes by blowing
up the school. Vincent«\Van Patten is the

-jock, Tom Roberts, with lotsof fuel but no
knowledge of how to start a ﬁre, and Clint
Howard is the schoolboy entreprenuer
who can make anything happen—for a
price (or a credit‘ card).

Last on the billing, but ever present on
the screen, are the Ramones. It is nearly
worth the price of admission alone to
watch their faces as they play “I Was A
Teenage Lobotomy” (followed the bounc-
ing Qualude), and to see Joey, Marky,
Dee Dee and Johnny Ramone chauf-
feured down the main street in a pink
1959 Cadillac lip synching “I Just Want
To Have Something To Do.” The chielf of
police descirbes the psuedo-brothers as
“ugly, ugly people” and in faded torn ‘
and black leather jackets hey stand a far
cry from collarless suits and Beatleboots.

“Rock’n’Roll High School” has the
potential to become a midnight classic,
but the movie does not promise anything.
You may like it or you may hate it, but
either way it is OK. The movie is just for

fun. ‘

Jefferson Starship/ Rory Gallagher
Stanley Theater
November 27, 197.9

The name remains the same, but the
band has changed. San Francisco’s
Jefferson Starship,’ in concerfiecently

" with Irish guitarist Rory Gallagher at
‘ the Stanley Theater, is no longer the

same band as when Grace Slick and

T Marty Balin were singing and writing

the majority of the group’s songs.

And anyone at the Stanley expecting
to hear the soulful croonings of Balin
or Slick on “Miracles,” “With Your

Love,” or “Runnin’ Away,” no doubt ’

was disappointed when the Jefferson
Starship 79’ laid down a two-a_nd-a-
half hour set of ear splitting music
which if anything was heavy, heavy
metal, seldom letting up in its volume
or intensity.

The Jefferson Starship has gone

Paul Kantne_r’s band. ,

The Grateful Dead
November 30—December 1, 1979
Stanley Theatre

By TOM MCGINTY

’ The Grateful Dead. It is no less than
amazing that The Grateful_ Dead,
which has never had a top’ twenty_
album or single, has one of the most
loyal and dedicated followings of any
musical performers, past or present.
Tlk Stanley Theater was packed a full
hour before the show began with a
truly unique gathering of excited,
rowdy and partially buzzed Dead
Heads. Many of these seemed to have
experienced the sheer thrill of a Dead
concert. Everyone present celebrated
the occasion in their own way from
dancing in‘ the aisles to recounting
memories of other Dead concerts to
selling’ Dead t-shirts. The conver-
sations that permeated the Stanley
were strangely similar.
centered around Jerry Garcia, the
concert in Cleveland the night before
and questions as to what songs would

‘H’ be played.

Clearly, Friday night was not the
average concert night in Pittsburgh.
For the Grateful Dead, this would be
their 4th stop in seven days and their
fifth performance in a schedule of 22
days and 15 shows. Considering the
fact that the Deadghad been giving
three-and-a—half hour shows, this
schedule becomes even more
impressive. This factlalone was
enough to raise the intensity of the

,,-?...evening far above the level of most

other concerts.

The Grateful Dead, America’s
premiere touring band, is led by the
legendary Jerry Garcia on lead guitar.
Garcia, guitarist Bob Weir and Ron
McKernan (Pigpen) formed the Dead
in .1964 in San Francisco when the
original name was “Mother McCree’s
Uptown Jug Champions.” The group,
then unknown, played the bars and

coffee houses throughout the bay area.
The next -year Bill Kreutzmann and
Phil Lesh joined just as they made the
change from a jug band to an electric
rock band. Drummer Mickey Hart
then came to them in 1967. Six years

, later "Donna Godchaux joined as

female vocalist. Her husband Keith
Godchaux had been the pianist with
the band for the previous two years.

A veritable ﬂood of albums began to
arise after 1973, the most well known

- being “Blues For Allah..” By this time

the Grateful Dead had easily become
the group of the hippie culture with the
most loyal fans on the West coast.
Subsequent albums by the individual

“ members of the Dead were released but

did not meet with the success that
other, more commercial groupswho
had ‘done the same thing (i.e. the
Beatles). However, the Dead came
back with “Terrapin Station” and
“Shakedown Street” on a new label,

Arista Records. -Until this ‘time they _

had been recording on Grateful Dead
Records and before that, Warner
Brothers Records. This last change
occurred in "1974. In 1978, the Dead

Thomas, the man ‘who has the
‘unenviable position of fillingin for

days of old. '"But unfortunately, his

In addition,‘ guitarist’ Craig
Chachico, a fine lead guitarist, hogged
the show all night with his show-off
antics of eating out of his guitar,
playing it behind his back, stabbing the
crowd with it to the point of annoy-
ance. _

And while we’re on the problem with
the Starship act, bassist Sears and new
drummer Dunbar, although two of
rock’s finest, had solos (Sears on
“Have You Seen the Saucers”‘and

is redundant’ and a ' pounding bore,
even though on this particular evening
Sears and Dunbar did receive standing
ovations. ‘  ' _

It’s obvious the Starship has taken
ona whole new image and sound with
this new line-up and stage act, and

' although the date in Pittsburgh was

only the fifteenth for the band a few

. stage kinks need to be ironed outto

keep this extremely talented group of
’musicians ﬂying successfully for years
to come. '

One man who had all of the kinks
worked out was the evening’s opening
act, the Irish Flash himself, Rory
Gallagher. From the time he stepped
onstage until the finish of his nine song

set, Gallagher had the crowd more '
stirred than the Starship ever did on .

The Grateful Dead‘ has completed a
new album earlier this fall titled “Go
To Heaven” which is scheduled to be
released shortly after the beginning of
next year. Also earlier this year, in
June, Keith and Donna Godchaux left
the Dead for personal reasons and were
replaced ‘by Keyboard‘ player and
vocalist Brent Mydland,' who played,
Friday night. 

The concert began promptly at 7:15
p.m. to the delight of the capacity
crowd. The Dead opted not to delay
the start of the show nor. soak the
crowd" for pre-concert applause, which
is becoming increasingly popular
lately. Rather they walked onto the

. . stage, tunedtheir instruments for a few

minutes and then began jamming. All
the while, screaming fans were on their
feet and many began what seemed to
be uncontrollable ‘dancing in the aisles.
The incredible ease with which the
performers played and the excellence
of the sound had to be experienced to
be appreciated fully. Although not
many of the old favorite songs were
played, there were a sufficient number
of them to satisfy, even the most casual
listeners of the Grateful Dead. The
most dominant aspect of‘ the group

hear. . ;
With just a three piece band to work
with, Gallagher and bassist Gerry
McAvoy and drummer Ted McKenna
wasted no time opening with the
frantic “Shin Kicker,” and pouring it
on until the wild, breakneck encore of
“Bull Frog Blues.” 1
Although Gallagher, dressed in jeans
and plaid shirt may notlook like a
typical, rocker, he more than makes up
for it with his hot shot guitar
approach, duckwalking like Chuck
Berry and .machine gunning the

- audience.

"That guitar," old, tattered andlin need

_ of a few coats of paint, nevertheless,

in the hands of Gallagher, was indeed a
killing machine.

“l’ve had this thing for an awful
long time,” said Gallagher’ after his set
during backstage rest, “almost as
long. as I’ve' been A a professional,”
which has been all of fifteen years.

. .-“Right now in England, the punk
scene seems to be getting all of the
attention as far as the media is
concerned but much of what gets the
attention lacks any sort ‘of musical
quality to it,” said the gentlemanly
‘Gallagher. - '

Friday was the great improvisation '

they. demonstrated. Lengthy,
sometimes ‘quite extensive. songs were
evidence enough of the virtuosity of
the members. Mydland’s keyboards
and vocals added an interesting
difference to the Dead’s sound
especially with the synthesizers. The
drumming of Hart and Kreutzmann
was as fun to watch as it was

i pleasurable to listen to. Probably the

most unexpected part of the show was
the performance by Bob Weir. His
work on the guitar was tremendous, to
say the least, and his vocals sounded
strong and true.
excellent and, as usual, acoustics at the
Stanley were perfect.

. After
intermission, the Dead jammed for
two more hours. By the end of the

_ evening, approximately 11:30 p.m.,
they finally ﬁnished their show nearly

four hours after it ‘had begun. The

‘ crowd had been drained of any energy

toapplaude by the end of the show but

_ somehow rejuvinated enough to bring

the Dead back for a well deserved
encore. As it has been said before,

“There is nothing like. a Dead
concert.”

“Don’t get me wrong, I love
aggressive music; in fact, that’s why I
went back to a three-piece after having
a larger band, but pounding a wall with
a hammer is an act of aggression but I
wouldn’t sit for three hours and accept
it as music because it simply isn’t.
Many of the punk bands need
seasoning,” said Gallagher.

“Airplay seems "to have always been a
problem for me,‘ but I would never go
out and cut a disco record because it
wouldn’t be .- me,” Gallagher

“However I would never go out and
present myself in any sort of grand‘
hyping by say management because
they think it will sell. If I ever do make

people will be getting the true represen-

Starship Takes /on New Loo

Jefferson Starship
Freedom At Point Zero
Grunt

By DAYID KOVACH -

A new Jefferson Starship
introduces a new sound with the
release of this new album.
“Freedom at Point Zero" reflects a.
radical change in the musical
direction of oneof America's
foremost rock bands. Breaking /
away from the traditionally melodic
sound familiar to Starship fans. this
L.P. epitomizes rock and roll at its
finest. '

These changes were brough

\ about by a series of events which

occurred in 1978. ..
‘Singers/songwriters Grace Slick’s
and Mary Balin's and drummer
John Barbata‘s departure were
“perhaps the biggest blows to the
. future of the Starship. A
Fortunately for the rock world.
the Jefferson Starship has
displayed incredible recuperative
powers. and continues to do so in
1979. Not since the “Dragonfly"
release has the Starship displayed
/ such raw energy and excitement.

The remaining band members
Paul Kantner. Pete Sears. David
Freiberg and Craig Chaquico are
joined by two new additions to the
group who are certainly not new
faces to the rock industry.
Aynsley Dunbar. best known for his,
most recent_ work with the San
Francisco based group Journey.

work thetsame lyric lines that both
Slick and Balin used to sing. In A
fact, the harngny vocals on the new
album are almost identical to the
Starship of old. On “Lightning

Balin and Slick never left. I

and Lightning Rose” compare
favorably with the old Marty Balin‘

the disc is “Awakening." an
eight-minute excursion_ that
doesn't really lead anywhere.

Another note or interest‘

concerning the new Jefferson

St arship is the emergence of Paul
Kantner as the group leader. A
founding father of the original
Jefferson Airplane. Kantner’s
rocking influence has come to the
forefront now more than ever
before. He also wrote or co-wrote
five of the nine new songs on
“Freedom” and is thus thechief
contributor.

Direction

The psychedelic o0’s and the

. mellow rock 70’s are left in the past.

The Jefferson Starship cruises into
ihfl 80's with a new crew and fresh
new rock and roll sound.

The overall changein direction
for the Starship is toward a heavier
rock and roll sound. New drummer
Dunbar is largely responsible for

his. He has given a powerfully
energetic and driving quality to the
new songs. The rocking title song
even begins with a 20-second
Dunbar drum solo. Thus. the new
songs are similar to the Starship
rockers fo the past; “Ride The

Tiger,” “Caroline” and. Dance.
‘With the Dragon." “Miracle” fans‘
take heed!

Tear Me Apart
Tanya Tucker
MCA_ T

By STEVE GUIDAS

Tanya Tucker, one of many
artists that have contributed
towards the new sound of country
and_Western, continues to do so
with her latest album release‘.

A “Tear Me Apart..’,’ ' .

Distinct vocals with a driving
instrumental back~up characterizes
Tucker’s cuts on the"album._

“Blind Love.’)’ the lead song on
the release. is a fast moving hard
rocking song. However. the
country sound still remains as
Tucker's Lorreta Lynn style twang
comes through.

The pace of the album slows
down as Tucker cries her heart out
with “Lay Back in the Arms of
Someone."

Cheating songs. evident in the
ﬁeld, are found in almost every
country and Western Album.

Tucker follows such a tradition with
“Somebody Must Have Loved You
Right Last Night.”

Maybe it’s because the album
was recorded in California that
Tucker pulls a couple of oldies out
of the closet. “San Francisco (Be Sure t‘
to Wear a Flower in Your'Hair)”/“I
Left My Heart in San Francisco,”

' sequeled together into one
arrangement. '

The album’s first side ends with
its title cut. “Tear Me Apart.”
Again. like the openingtsong, it’s a
fast pace rock sound with a country
t_wist.

“Crossfire of Desire” opens the
second side of the album continuing
where the first side leaves off.
strong and fast moving.

The Track, “Better Late Than J ' i

    

.424:
C
Never,” opens with a narration and"
sounds as though it’s from the
musical “Grease.” V
“I’ve Never Said No Before.” an
easy listening melody and “Shady
Streets” slow the album down once
again as Tucker’s vocals carry the
songs well.
“By Day By Day.” the album

closer is enriched with gospel

folk music. blended with the
various musical interests of
America in the sixties, gives way to -

become popular in Pittsburgh, who
call themselves Devilish Merry.
The merger is authentic. and

easy to listen to, from jigs to
ballads. In a series of well-nieshed
niedleys, Devilish Merry recreates
the uncomplicated and natural ‘
colors of music that is derived from
more obscure regions of_ folk
culture than bluegrass of Childe
ballads. There isla consistant.
rhythm in the album which Devilish
Merry describes as l . '
trance-inducing. lending to g «

sensations of fantasy. And that ’s
nice.

When a listener does’ not feel
obligated to critically hang Onto
every note. it is much easier to
absorb the music and. in away.
easier to feel a part of the moods
depicted.

The album notes give historical
clues as to the origin of the tunes.
some of which, aside from being
hypnotic. are combined with mild
humor and unique idioms. Oneof
the prettier pieces on the album is

"‘Tis A Gift -To Be Simple.” sung by

the group’s banioist. Sue Powers.
Her vocal quality hints at a variety of
influences.yand yet the song _
achieves the balance that is
necessary, in order for anything to
traditional to ring true. It is
in'te1‘eSting to note that Aaron
Copeland used the melody of the
song, in “Appalachian Spring.”
Other tunes on the album are easily .-
recognized, too, such as
“Cameron's Quickstep" or “The
Exile’s:Jig." Perhaps they are
recognized from exploitations of
traditional idioms. but here. they
are performed with the truth and
purity they deserve.

Well-studied in this blended
format, Devilish Merry are ablerto
carry off some original material,
with thesame novelty as the rest. '
Larry McCullough contributes two
Irish reels which he composed. and
there are also Larry Edelman's_
“Birthday Jig”.and “The Forced
March.” by dulcimer player Burr
Beard.

In the notes, the group
acknowledges a desire for their
listeners to feel a friendly
relationship to what they have
produced. The presentation of their
material is proof of the sincerity
behind this desire. for it is
"presented without intimidation.
pretense, oiranything that might.

  Toni Brown
Goes Solo  

Toni Brown
Fantasy

By MARGERY MEYERS _

Toni Brown offers a nice variety of
- songs on her debut LP.

You may remember Toni Brown
from days w_hen she and Terry
Garwaithethad-a band called Joy of
Cooking. ‘Since the sixties. Brown
has remained relatively obscure.
polishing her songs for her first solo
album.

The first song on her self-titled
solo album “Knockin’.” isia rather
bland introduction to an album
which at least’ holds promise for
historical reasons. But after the
obligatory mainstream is out of the
way. it ’s clear that Brown has more
sophisticated offerings in mind.

“Waikiki. Why Not” is a
bebopish tune. Brown lets go of her
voice and sounds peculiarly like
Maria Muldaur. and yet the song is
not a fake. by any deﬁnition. The .
lyrics and melody are quite original.
and Red Rhodes adds interest to the
arrangement.

With “Stop The Night." the album
becomes a serious work of art. The
‘  cohesiveness oflyrics and music is
' unusually strong. and the sha1‘.Pt1€SS
in T_oni Brown's description is the
sort. of purity that is missed in most
of pop lyrics of the late seventies.
With a line—up of some very famous V
musicians behind her. she opens up
a wealth of humor. poetry. and
music that is subtly flavored with
jazz.

“Dance Me" is a fascinating
song which combines boogie
woogie with a tango in the chorus.
The lyrics bespeak a classic desire
to put tiff the bad things until
tomorrow. and substitute them with
fantasies.‘ Shc prefers to have her
partner wear her like arose. than to
hear his complaints pit ted against
her own. _ '

The most successful tunes on the
album are “Listen to the Rain", and
.“I Get Crazy." The latter is a
‘ j funky. upbeat complaint about a -
lover who is probablytfrom .Marin
County. The former. along with
“Two ofa Kind." is beautifully-
arranged. and both have_unusual
melodies that are enhanced by
Brown's fine musicians.

\—

In “An Evening Lullabye." he
thin voice iakes on a strange
reseniblan_ce to Billie Holliday.
 ~ This is perhaps her most poetic
I song‘. and.it is peculiar in its
. insistanceito be bluesy. though the

lyrics are warm and h‘appyt.tt-tt t;t ft

World of
Stix Hooper

STIX H OOPER
The World Within Stix H OOPER
MCA

By DAVID STUBBS

5

During the past four years the
Crusaders have ventured into new
worlds with their music. Besides
their own group efforts, each .
member of the Crusaders has
experimented with several solo
encounters. The latest ofthese solo
performances is by drummer
writer, producer and arranger Stix

Hooper. “The World Within Stix
Hooper” displays the drummer’s
versatility over the seven songs.
‘Each one is very different from the
others as Hooper demonstrates all of
his diverse musical skills.

' The disc contains: two funk
numbers. an African drum song, an
oriental rhythm rhyme. a Joe Sample
(Cijusaders‘ keyboardi'st) melody. a
R&B abllad. and an interesting
modern Caribbeafn tune.

The funky “Brazos River
Breakdown" is a ‘typical Hooper
c_ompositio_n with a different kind of
arrangement which features the
frequently used Seawind horn
section. “African~Spirit ” is a very
rhythmic percussion venture chant
collaborations done byHooper and
popular studio percussionist,
Paulinho da Costa. “Rum or
Tequila” is a sort of Caribbean funk
crossover tune featuring renowned
vibist Bobby Hutcherson.
“Passion" is a sorry at tempt at a
mainstream R&B ballad and is the

only tune on the entire disc that
isn‘t worthwhile. “Hooper’s singing
is pretty good but the song simply
doesn’t have it. -

Side two opens with Joe Sample’s
“Cordon Bleu." As with most
Sample melodies. the melody flows
quite easily and the song has a kind
of hu’me'a'-'l'on'g"'feeling to it. The
standout’feature on this tune is the
use of muset te. a rarely heard
French bagpipe played effectively
by Frank Marocco. “Jasmine
Breeze" is perhaps the most
interesting tune on the disc. The
song has a distinct oriental flavor

which is carried by an oriental
wooden flute called a shakuhachi.
An angular banjo called a koto adds
to thevflavor. The final number is a
very funky rendition of the popular -

.< .

.—..J.-..--‘-o-.u-u- t n » - - »-.-.<u.u-

4

Christmas carol, “The Little
Drummer Boy.” The song gets
abot as funky as possible and still
remains recognizable. Hutcherson
solos again and so does guitarist
Barry Finnerty. _
Hooper has put a real success
together here. The album ‘is
nowhere near as predictable as
some Crusaders’ albums can be. It
is clearly the best Crusader solo
effort since the critically acclaimed
“Rainbow Seeker” by Joe Sample.
The album covers a wide spectrum
of interpretive music and isjust the‘
thing needed to get the proverbial
Cobwevs out of your ears. T

ELP live Ill
  Not SoHot  

Emerson, Lake and Palmer '
In Concert
Atlantic

By MARK HOLAN ,

“In 1977, Emerson. Lake and
Palmer were joined onstageby a
65-piece orchestra in a magnificent

. world tour of symphonic rock. One
of the most exciting musical events
of the decade."

So reads the ad copy for
“Emerson, Lake and Palmer in
Concert.” the latest release by
England’s once legendary trio.
Unfortunately. this is not one of‘
the most exciting events of the
decade and is the poorest of ELP’s
three live recordings._

“Pictures At An Exhibition,” the
trio’s first live album. contained a
previously unreleased
interpretation of Mussorgsky’s
symphony ala Emerson’s..
synthesizers and Lake_’s lyrical
additions. In 1975. ELP released
the triple-disc “Welcome Back My
Friends To The Show That Never‘
Ends, Ladies and Gentlemen.
Emerson, Lake and Palmer.”

. Masterfully arranged and produced.

“Welcome Back" captured the
group at the height ofits career (the
“Brain Saled Surgery” tour) and,
along with ‘.fYessongs" is one of

the most definitive concert albums of
the classical/ electronic/ rock genre.

The same can not be said,
however, for this_lat_est live effort.
The album contains seven cuts; five
from “Works Volume 1" and ,
“Works Volume  Also featured
is a new rendition of “Pictures At A
An Exhibition" and a previously
Mancini’s “Peter Gunn."

Side One opens with “Peter
Gunn.” a throbbing keyboard piece
featuring Keith Emerson. It
captures Emerson's style as well as

. ‘‘Hoedown.'' which was used as the
opening number on previous tours.
and provides tltc only
“Excitement"- of the album. It's

_ followed by “Tiger In The
Spotlight." “C'est La Vie.” “The ,
Enemy God" and “Knife Edge.”

Greg Lake’s voice is weak and
distant on all the cuts (with the
exception of “The Enemy God,"
an Emerson. Carl Palmer
instrumental.) The blame.
however. can not all be put on Lake.

‘ The mix on this album is horrible.
Not only does Lake's voice get lost.
but so does the symphony.» '

Side Two is a little better. Emer-
son‘s7‘Piano Concert No. 1" is the
best example of how effective and
enjoyable the symphony must have
been to concert-goers. (Because of
the high expenses involved. ELP
dropped the symphony about five
days before its June 1977'

. appearance at the Civic Arena.)

“Pictures At An Exhibition"
closes‘ the album. Like “Knife
Edge." from ELP's first album, this
number illustrates how much
inspiration and power the trio has
lost over the years. Iflast year's
“Love Beach" proved that
Emerson. Lake_and Palmer can't do
it on st'a‘g"e'an’3/hibré éi't’lie'r-’-i-‘anici '1  ii 5" ‘ i

 

. .. .. .. .. ....-..-.--

t. by Erskine, with effective support

i_tinie.~' 

this album was recorded over two
years ago.

All talented musicians, it seems ‘
that the best course of action for the
trio would be for Emerson to start
composing more symphonie_s, Lake
t_o launch an acoustic solo career and
Palmer to become one of the ‘>
highest paid percussion me_n in the
business.

The Latest
Report 

“8:30”
WEATHER REPORT

CBS/ARC ,
By WALTER R. WATSON

The mos_t revolutionary group in

progressive jazz and jazz/ rock

fusion music has released its first
live album in its eight year history,
“8:30’.’ is return to traditional
thought, yet a departure from
traditional instrumentation or
musical statement. What Josef
Zawinul. Jaco Pastorius. Wayne
Shorter. and newcomer Peter
Erskine (Erskine has been with the
group for one prior date. ‘78’s “Mr.
Gone") have accomplished is a
two-record set of music that will
forge them back into the auspicious
light of praise from die hard fans
and skeptical critics alike.

Three sides of this double-record set
are live. with side four presenting
new studio material. The album
features some of the best music .
Weather Report has released on
recording and in concert. Side one
erupts with the highly volatile,
pleasantly tropical “Black

Market.” “Scarlet Woman" blasts
off pfowerfully. beyond the realm of '
contemporaryjazz. Side two
features the loose rhythms and free /
flowing melodies Weather Report is ,
capable of sharing with listeners in
person or on disc. of which “Teen
Town" and “A Remark You Made”
bear ideal representation. The“ 
most important consideration to the
first three sides of “8:30” is the

fact that the quartet does a bang-up
job ofjamming on stage which
equals and often overwhelms the
original versions done in the V
studios. Most evident to this ' i 
impression is the group’s most
popular composition, “Birdland."
which bouncesiii with a rock"n"roll
feel served most appropriately by
Pastorius’ bass riffs"a'nd cruises ‘ -
into a cool jazz rhythm layed down

by the tune’s composer. Zawinul on
synthesizers and Shorter on
soporano sax. Ultimately. the~~~‘--- t
composition becomes a bigger
winner than the studio version.

Individual expertise is shown
throughout the album. Zawinul’s
orchestralkeyboard work on “A ,
Remark You Made” and “In A
Silent Way"; Shorter’s ingenious
soprano and tenor solos on “Teen
Town." “A Remark You Made.”
‘‘In A Silent Way." and especially
“Thanks For The Memory;" .laco’s
memorable moments on the _
semi-funky. quasi-rock bass solo.
“Slan_g;" Erskine's duet with
Shorter on “Black Market” and the
light touches on skins and cymbals
on “Teen Town."

Side four rips open with “8:30”.
a musical assault loaded with the
soar of raw and sandy textures of
Zawinul, carried by the lean.
driving druniwork of Pastorius.
“Brown Street" is _a mellow cut
which is good complacent jazz. It
couldhave done more. “The I
Orphan" features a children's
choir. and a Wayne Shorterjam.
“Sightseeing‘,‘, rides the rapid pace
of Sixties jazz.

In the end. Weather Report wins
the race for innovative .sup'remacv.
for a while. at least. Going intothe
805 with this offering. for whatever
reason itsA_fti‘t|‘e. ‘J‘8_:}’0¢",ti_s rigllit_l<i)n g

The Ken Karsh Quartet has become a
popular ﬁxture on the Pitt campus.
having done many concerts for various
student organizations. On Monday night.
Backspace. Pitt’s literary magazine. had

. their third turn to present to students
some of the finest jazz in the city.

The show started rather Iate.~but when
Karsh took the stage. he jumped righ-
into an upbeat tune that woke up a small
audience of serious fans.

The quality of sound was unfortunate.
The musicians were unable l0 hear
themselves. onstage. and Harry Cardil-
Io's keyboard was almost inaudible. but
they rose to the circumstance with humor
and great effort. with a tune called

“Chet-okee." John Shmidt played a solo "

on drums that displayed a tremendous
proficiency and caring.

A local favorite written b_y Karsh. “The
Ducks of Boston.", was well-accepted.

    Ex-nuke Nixon‘ Slams ‘All-Stars’  

By The Associated Press

LOS ANGELES——He’s only in his

third National Basketball Associa-

tion season, he’s never been in an

All-Star Game and he’s not among -

the league’s top scorers. But there

a are hardly any better backcourt

players in the NBA than Norm
Nixon. .
The Los Angeles Lakers abound
in ta1ent—-with rookie sensation
Earvin “Magic” Johnson, All-Pro
center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and
steady Jamaal Wilkes—but more
and more it’s‘Nixon who is taking
the important shots late in close
games. .
' A lack of notoriety is nothing new
for the 24-year-old Nixon, who has
some impressive statistics one-
third of the way through the
1979-80 NBA season in helping the
Lakers win 19 of their first 28
games. .
- Fact is, Nixon's never been
highly acclaimed.
V “Hopefully, one year I'll make
an All-Star team,” said Nixon, who

» is averaging nearly 18 points and
. over seven ‘assists per game while
’ , hitting about 54 percent’ of his field

    

goal attempts and 75 percent of his
free throw tries. “But I realize it’s
a popularity contest. It’s not
necessarily a true measure of
ability.

“It’s frustrating at times,” he

. continued, referring to his lack of

recognition. “I’ve been in that
position since high school. The
name’s never been there. I
thought it would change in the
NBA and it did a little bit. It gives
you something to work for, som
extra incentive. I like that.

“I think I’m established in the
league, among the players and
coaches. They know what’s
happening.”

Nixon, who atended Duquesne
University, was picked by the
Lakers in the first round of the 1977
draft. He was the 22nd player
drafted and the reaction in Los
Angeles was one of._surprise. Very
few people/heard of Norm Nixon.

“I was an honorable mention
All-American for three years,” said
the Lakers’ guard. “I was
ﬁrst-team All-East for two years
and was in the top 20 in scoring in

. the nation for two years, but I
didn’t -get'a tryout for the Olympic

  

V

   

team or the Pan-American team.”
So it’s little wonder that Lakers’

fans wondered about -Norm Nixon. _

But he became a starter at the
outset of his rookie season and has
been a regular ever since.

The conﬁdent Nixon said he
doesn’t think he’s a great deal
better now physically than when h
was a rookie. . ~

“I think I’ve gotten experience,
and that makes a 200 or 300 percent
difference in your game,” he said.

“I don't think you improve on your , .

skills that much. You learn how to
pace yourself.

“I made a lot more mistakes at
that time then I make now. Your
effectiveness is made 200 percent
better by experience, especially in
terms of helping or hurting the
team.

“I’ve always been conﬁdent, the’
confidence around me has grown. I
get a lot of ~«shots down the
stretch.” ‘

Nixon gets many more important
shots than he does recognition.
Buy maybe that will
especially if the Lakers win the

NBA championship.- _And that is a =

good possibility this season.

A The Pitt basketball Panthers will
get a better opportunity to prove
their mettle tonriorrow evening
when they open their Eastern Eight
season in Amherst, _Mass, against
the University of Massachusetts
Minutemen. The Panthers (2-_0)
are sure to get a stronger test in the
land of the Kennedys than they did
Wednesday night in a 77-50 win
over Robert Morris at the Field
House.

If the Panthers had ‘made better
use of free-throw chances, the score
could have been worse for Robert
Morris, -but’ Pitt only hit 13 of 26
foul shots. .

Sam Clancy. playing with some
back problems. managed to score
10 points, while pulling—down a
game-high 19 rebounds. At times,
Clancy seemed intent on helping
the Colonials’ cause, as he was
called for several goaltending
violations. RM (now 0-3) made but
two ﬁeld goals in the first half
(excluding the goaltending) and the
game was decided in the early

moments, as Pitt raced out to a 17-4 '

lead,_ which became 30-12 at the

“The main problem was that we

‘ weren’t playing together as a team,

and that we weren’t concentrat-

scored 13 points, and sounded like
a guy whose team just lost, instead

Angels Busy Trading ” 

TORONTO———The ‘active Californ-
ia Angles, American League ‘West
-champions, acquired veteran out-
fielder Al Cowens and sent
budding star Willie Mays Aikens to
Kansas City in a ﬁve,-player’. deal
Thursday at baseba-ll’s
meetings. '- '

The deal was only the third in the
ﬁrst four days of the "week-long
meetings, which could end with an

- all-time low in player transactions.

The wheelers and dealers, how-

_ ever, have until midnight Friday to

replace rumors with accomplish-
ments. I ' _ . ,

In addition to Cowens, 28, one of
the key players in Kansas City’s

three ‘consecutive AL West titles '

from 1976-1978, the Angels receiv-
ed Todd Cruz, 23, a ﬁne defensive
shortstop but weak on offense, and

' a player to be named later.

Kansas City, trying to regain the
title, also received shortstop Rance
Mulliniks in the deal that was a
slight gamble for the Royals, ‘since
Aikens is
operation.

Jim Frey, the‘ new Kansas City
manager, said Cruz was expend-
able because U.L. Washington will

v be his regular shortstop.
» .. ‘.‘We think Willie Aikens is one

of the best young power hitters in
baseball,” Frey ‘said of the
25-year-old ﬁrst baseman who hit
.280 with 21 home runs and 81 runs
batted in during 1979 before
injuring his knee late in the season.

“His knee surgery has been
successful and he is convalesing
successfully. We_..had our doctor
check with the surgeon and the
operation in late September was a
success,” Frey said. _ A .

Frey admitted, however, “if
Aikens ‘can't play_ we_ have a.

coming ‘off a knee"

t

'tt Cagers Mop Up Colonials, 7-50

and overall team defense.

“But at least we learned- a lesson
with a ‘W’ instead of an ‘L,” said
Neverson.

The Panthers will have to learn
their lessons well, because the rest
of the month of December (and
1980, for that matter) will certairirify
give them enough competition to
last a few seasons. After UMass,
Pitt will take a week off for. ﬁnal
exams, then host another Eastern
Eight school, St. Bonaventure,
Dec. 15.

From there, it’s on to Riverfront
Coliseum, where order should by
then be restored after the Who
concert, for a Dec. 19 game»with
the Cincinnati Bearcats. UC has

Wednesday night it was a matter

of whether the basketball went

through the hoop or not. For-

.tunately, it was Pitt who was

hearing the swish of the nets as the

Pantherettes dumped Duquesne
University, 72-37.

The win was obviously a result of
Duquesne’s poor shooting. The
D hesses only sunk 15 shots in 60
attempts, while Pitt connected on
33 of 65. Otherwise, the Panther-
ettes had a 17-16 edge in turnovers
while grabbing only 50 rebounds
from the much smaller’Duquesne
clu-b.

' The Pantherettes waited until

4:20 remained in the first half
before showing any of their
offensive talents. At that point,
Pitt held a slight 25-20 lead. Debbie
Lewis converted a three-point play
and dropped two layups in the next
20 seconds to give Pitt a 32-20
margin.

Ready or not, here they come:
those athletes in shorts and tank
tops dribbling that orange round
ball all over the court, trying to put
it through a'l;toop. In case you
hadn’t noticed, football season is
almost over; and basketball season
has been quietly ushered in with
convincing victories over Bucknell
and Robert Morris.

The “other” sport at Pitt has
grown the past two seasons and
seemingly is on the verge of some-
thing big. Appearances, however,
can be deceiving.

At Pitt, basketball does not enjoy
the same success or prestige. as

football. Experts seem to believe '

Pittsburgh is not a basketball town,
and that fans aren’t interested in
the sport. ‘

This argument can pretty (much I
be discarded, since. fans turned out "L

in record numbers for the Eastern
Eight tournament held here in this
football town. ‘‘

Fan support is really an
insignificant factor, if indeed it is a
factor at all. Thecrux of the whole

«situation is the inability to lure

quality players to put on the Blue

and Gold. Do not, however, blam '

Tim Grgurich for this. «

ations of being stingy with its
-athleticbudget unless, of ‘course,
the sport is football. This
stinginess also applies to other
varsity sports.

There is no reason why Pitt can’t

have successful teams in both foot-_

ball and basketball. Since Pitt is a
large college, it surely can afford to
dish out more money. and balance
out the two.

Basketball does enjoy more
success than most of the other
sports. The grossly underfunded
swim teams and baseball teams
could use some extra cash. ‘

One can argue that football
brings in the most money and,
therefore, should get the highest
budget. This is true, but one
cannot forget that although sports

9-.

  All Bowls Aside- It Really Is 11tat rims ofYear for Basketball  

such as swimming, baseball and
gymnastics do‘ not produce any
money to speak of, there are
athletes who participate in these
sports and deserve a better fate.

The women’s swim team has a
meet in Michigan today, and due to
the lack of funding, _it is forced to
take a bus this morning and
perform well tonight. We are not
talking about a one-hour bus ride;
but more like a nine-hour ride. Do
you think the football team would
ever take a nine-hour bus ride for
a game? V 

I am not advocating the
lessening of the football team’s
budget, but more of an increase for
other sports. After all, although
most fans couldn’t care less, the
athletes do. '

Darryl Dawkins Displays) Demolishing Dunk Once Again

By The Associated Press _

PHILADELPHIA—Darryl Daw-
kins’ backboard-breaking “choco-
late thunder” slam dunks may be
numbered.

A National Basketball Associa-
tion official said Thursday that the
league was considering a collap-
sible basket that would separate
from the backboard and the
support bracket when placed under
more than 260 pounds of pressure.

“The player would end ‘up
holding the rim,” explained Joe
Axelson, the NBA’s director of
operations. “The rim could then
be re-attached quite simply so the
game wouldn't be held up. We’re

getting ready to test it in the next '

week or 10 days.”

Dawkins, a 255-pound, 6-foot-11
center for the Philadelphia 76ers,
destroyed his second NBA back-
board in less than a month
Wednesday night‘ in a home game
against the San Antonio Spurs.

Cooking the ball between his
shoulder blades, he soared into the
air and rammed it through the
hoop. The backboard rained glass,
the net tangled in his hands, and he
left a hole 20 inches square.

In Kansas City on Nov. 13,
Dawkins brought down the entire
backboard. Both games were
delayed more than an hour while
repairs wre made.

“It was the power, the chocolate
thunder,” Dawkins said of the

‘.'_:|_lll||Il|||||||l|I||'l

latest dunk. “I could feel it surging
through my body, ﬁghting to get
out. ‘I had no control over it.”
' Axelson, in a phone interview
from New York, said that since the
Kansas City dunk, the NBA has
been looking into the possibility of
installing stronger backboards.
“We’ve heard from a couple of
companies that have boards they
claim are practically unbreakable,”
he said. “The ‘problem is they have
to be transparent.’-’
