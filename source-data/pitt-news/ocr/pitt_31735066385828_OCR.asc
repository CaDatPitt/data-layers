Plans for a Pittsburgh City Council
resolution, a symposium on segregation
and racism and a campus~wide graffiti-
erasing project were announced at a
meeting of Students Against Racism last
Thursday.

City Councilman Dan Cohen is excited
about the Pitt student organization and
will propose a resolution to give STAR
Council recognition, according to Lara
Cook, public—relations committee
chairwoman for STAR.

Cook added that the publicity generated
by Cohen’s resolution will give STAR a
greater opportunity to interact with larger

community groups having similar
concerns.
The resolution will be a formal

acknowledgement by City Council,
according toJ.E. Paisley, an aid to Cohen,
whose district includes North Oakland.

The resolution will be presented next
Tuesday in Council chambers, she said.

“We wanted to say, ‘We think what
you’re doing is very commendable, and
we’d like to offer our support,’ “ Paisley
added.

STAR’s symposium on racism and
segregation on college campuses,
speciﬁcally Pitt, is tentatively scheduled to
take place in early April.

“A lot of space will be given for debate
and intervention by students,” according
to Luigi Giovine, STAR planning committee
chairman. The group hopes to use the
symposium to gather the suggestions and
impressions of a large cross section of
students, he said.

“We would like for departments, faculty
members and people involved with human-
rights issues to call us to be involved as
speakers in the symposium,” Giovine said.

The graff1ti—erasing project will begin on
Monday at 2 p.m. in Hillman Library.
Members of ST AR will erase racist comments

STAR catches attention of City Councilman Cohen

and ethnic slurs written or painted on
walls in the building.

“Hopefully we will cover most of the
buildings on campus,” said STAR President
Matt Sipple.

Other projects currently being planned
by STAR include fund raising, creating an
anti-racism quilt and becoming a chartered
student organization.

In order to raise money for the
symposium, STAR will begin selling rafﬂe
tickets this week. The prize has not yet
been determined, although ideas discussed
at the meeting included half of the total
amount of money raised and a dinner for
two at an Oakland restaurant. A T-shirt
sale is also being considered as a future
fund-raising project.

STAR is planning to create a quilt, “to get
student organizations together as a
symbolic act of union,” said Giovine.

The quilt will bear signatures and
statements against racism by members of
Pitt student groups.

“We hope to get a public official to come
to the quilt and sign it,” Sipple said.

Members of STAR are working on a
budget proposal to present to the Student
Government Board. The group plans to
apply to become a chartered university
organization.

STAR is seeking to expand its
membership and is distributing ﬂyers
around campus to publicize meetings and
events. STAR members are also meeting
with members of other organizations,
including the Black Action Society and the
SGB, to ask for their cooperation.

“We would like to make itvery clear that
we ‘need and want support from as many
established organizations, such as the BAS,
as possible, to help us desegregate the
university and fight racism,” Sipple said.

Elections of STAR officers for the fall
term will be held in early April.

The next meeting of STAR will take
place at8 p.m. on Wednesday. The location
has not yet been announced.

Pride and gratitude for the Stroh’s Brewery sponsored

support given to local charities
were topics presented at the
Greek Week opening ceremonies
held on Friday in the William Pitt
Union Ballroom.

Polly Speros, external public—
relations chairwoman, read a letter
from Mayor Sophie Masloff which
commended Pitt Greeks on all of
their efforts and proclaimed the
week of March 23 through 31
Greek Week in the city of
Pittsburgh.

A letter from Gov. Robert P.
Casey also commended the
Greeks for their “charitable
attitude and concern for society."

Joe Cavella, keynote speaker,
said, “While I was thinking of a
topic to speak about, the word
‘proud’ came to me. I’m truly
proud to know that our Greek
community is working with St.
Francis [Medical Center] and our
fine sponsors. I’m proud when I
drive through Pittsburgh and see
billboards associating the Greek
system with the ‘Courage to Come
Back’ campaign.

“I’m proud to read the names
of those people who are chairing
committees. Classroom
knowledge is important, but the
preparation for Greek Week helps
[students also]. My arms are still

A balloon race was one of the games to kick oﬂ’ Greek Week yesterday.

Greek Week “fun and games” on

Fraternities and sororities were
organized into six different match
groups to compete in the eight
events.
Match Group Three, which

Phi Epsilon, Chi Omega, Pi

Pitt officials remember draft of Vietnamera

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer

Though it is nearing two

- decades since he was eligible for

Selective Service, Reginald
McKnight can still remember his
draft number: 11.

Since December 1969, Selective
Service had been picking
birthdays and assigning them
numbers through the lottery
system. With a number so low,
McKnight faced what many of his
generation call one of the most
difficult decisions of their lives.
To avoid being drafted during

this era, people would seek

exemptions by claiming poor
health or homosexuality, by
becoming conscientious objectors

_ who were opposed to violence

on principle, or even by hiding
from the authorities.

Now a professor in Pitt’s English
Department, McKnight opted to
enlist before Uncle Sam called
him. He served in Vietnam and

_ said that he “is not at liberty to say

what I did there,” though he
acknowledges that he did not
engage in combat.

“It was sort of a family thing to

' do,” he said. “A lot of my friends

were burning their draft cards,
but I came from a military family
with a lot of veterans from the last
three wars of this country.

“I wasn’t as teary-eyed patriotic
as the Ron Kovic character in
Born on the Fourth of July, but I
felt it was the thing to do.”

McKnight’s father was an Air
Force sergeant who served both
in Korea and Vietnam, and one of
hisuncles died in Vietnam. But
other events‘ also pushed him

toward his decision: in one week
his car broke down, he lost his
job and he broke up with his
girlfriend.

“It was an awful week,”
McKnight said, laughing. “So you
join the military and get away for
a while. Really, I wanted to run
away from my problems; it was a
mixture of things.

“While I was in the military, I
was as miserable as everyone
else was. It was the tail end of the
war, and morale was really low.”

McKnight remembers being
marched by a sergeant in boot
camp up to a wall that had dried
blood and brains splattered on it.

The sergeant then told the troops

that another private a few weeks
earlier had taken his gun and
used it on himself there. The
sergeant added, “Privates, it ain’t
that bad.”

“It was difficult for everybody,
including people who dodged
the draft,” McKnight said. “The

hardest part for me was losing a

lot of 9 my friends [who were
opposed to the war].

“My intention wasn’t to kill
people but to serve my country,
as corny as that may sound today.”

Since draft registration was
reinstated a decade ago, most
men of draft age have paid little
attention to their Selective Service

Cards, which get buried in the

backs of their wallets. But the
card was critical to men ages 18 to
26 until 1973, when the draft
ended. , .

Until 1969, those of draft age
whowere judged fitto serve —
classified I-A — were drafted
along with conscientious objectors
available for noncombatant

service and civilian duties. The
oldestwere chosen first. Then, at
the height of the war, the draft
system changed to a lottery
system, in which birthdays were
drawn and assigned numbers. If
you were 19, and your birthday
had a low-enough number, you
were drafted.

With a fiance and a brother
eligible for the draft, Joyce
Giangarlo, now associate director
of student activities, could not
avoid watching the first lottery.

“It was sick,” she said. “They
picked the birthdays on national
TV. It was just like the
Pennsylvania daily lottery.” Both
her fiance and her brother drew
“borderline numbers,” but neither
were called.

There was also concern in the
family of Sally Murphy, now a
professor in the Communications
Department, for her younger

brother. Murphy’s mother had
even documented her brother’s
medical history, especially his
back problems, so that the
information could be given to the
draft board in the event that his
number was called.

It turned out not to be a
problem. When the lottery came,
his birthday was given a number
“in the 3405.”

“I remember very clearly when
my younger brother was in the
lottery,” said Murphy. “There was
a family celebration. We were all
over the country, but we all called
each other.”

Once drafted, the would-be
soldiers could still avoid service,
provided they did not pass the
physical examination. Many
avoided the draft, some
legitimately and others by making
sure they wouldn’t pass the
medics’ tests.

“I had one friend who got out
of Vietnam because he stuttered, ”

— said Pitt Program Council Adviser
Tom Misuraca. “He passed his
physical, but he had all of his
therapist’s reports. They made
him a IV-F [not qualified for
service]. You don't want a guy
next to you who stutters when
there’s a Viet Cong sneaking up

on you.”

Another friend of Misuraca’s
ate an entire shaker of salt before
his physical, to Pktmp up his
blood pressure. It worked, but
after finding no record of high
blood pressure in his medical
history, the doctors told him to
return in a week.

“Three days before he went

back, he put track marks in his .

arm with a hat pin,” said Misuraca.
“They took a blood test” and
found no narcotics in his system,
so he was drafted.

“I had a lot of friends who were
thinking about shooting off their
toes," he said. “You had a lot of
middle-class kids like men: who
had to make their first big
decision.”

When Misuraca’s lottery
number was selected, he and
eight of his friends were listening
to the radio in his room on the
third ﬂoor of a dormitory at Ohio
University.

“When the first birthday was
picked, he recalled, “I heard a
scream when they announced
who,waS No. 1. Then I Saw a guy
ﬂy past my window.” The student
had jumped off the eighth ﬂoor,
but he landed in the bushes and
was OK. Misuraca did not know
him and doesn’t know if he was
drafted.

Misuraca had thought that his
medical history would help him
avoid the draft, because he had
both borderline high blood
pressure and ﬂat feet. However,
by the time he reached draft age
in the early 1970s, “they were
taking everyone. ”....

“Luckily, I ‘got a high number,
245,” he said. “They were drafting
up to 200, and up to 220 were
getting physicals.” .

Misuraca decided not to take a
student deferment, which was
for a maximum of four years by
the 1970s. His reason: because
his number was high; if he was
not called that year, his number
would be placed behind all of the
following year’s 19-year-olds. If
he had taken the deferment, his
number would have been thrown

Draft

Continued from page 2
in with the 19-year—olds upon his
graduation from college.
However, many others did take
advantage of student deferments

‘ during the war. Having been of

draft age during the 1960s, before
student deferments were limited
to four years, Acting Vice President
for A Student Affairs Dennis
Donham was able to avoid service
despite being drafted more than
once.

In 1970, Donham was called in
front of the draft board. At that
time, he was working for the
student—activities department at
Grinnell College in Iowa and was
planning to start work on his
doctorate._

“I told [the draft board] that I,

wanted to Finish my work
experience,” Donham said. “I
wasn’t trying to evade the draft.”

Donham was allowed to continue.
He turned 26 before he was done
at Grinnell, and therefore, became
ineligible for the draft.

“Draft—board physicals were the
weirdest things,” Donham said.
“It was this massive call-up, [which
was] heavily bureaucratized. You
had long lines of people, all
naked, standing with a little bag
containing their wallets and
watches.”

Some of the paperwork which
draftees were required to fill out
asked explicit questions about
bizarre sexual deviance. Donham
filled out the forms, saying that
he had not engaged in the
practices, but his forms were
misplaced, and he was sent to the
wrong line. He noticed that the
conversation was a little strange.

“Suddenly it dawns on me,”
Donham said. “I’m with a bunch

of perverts.” Donham told an
Army official that he had filled
out forms saying he hadn’t
engaged in these practices. The
official gave him new forms and
put him in a different line.

Though many of those drafted
did serve in Vietnam, there were
some who were fortunate enough
to get stationed elsewhere.
According to Misuraca, one of his
friends was a star football player
who was stationed in Germany,
because there was a good army
league there.

After years of musical training,
both vocal and instrumental,
Misuraca was told by his college
counselors to make the best of
his experience should he be
drafted and “start practicing.”

“I was told, ‘If you carry a horn,
you won’t carry a gun,”’ he said.
“The best thing that could happen

is you would follow BobHope
[on tour]. The worst would be to
be the entertainment on a base in
a friendly country.”

However, it was something
much less pleasant that kept Gary
Houston from serving in Vietnam:
Afterihe was drafted, his father
was diagnosed as being
terminally ill with pancreatic
cancer.

“I was supposed to go,” said
Houston, now executive assistant
to the vice president of student
affairs. “I had orders for Vietnam.”

Because of his father_’s condition,_

Houston was given a
“compassionate reassignment” in
the Pittsburgh area.

Houston noted that a need for

- what he was doing in Pittsburgh

was another reason he was
allowed to stay. His duties were
“basically doing background

investigations for security checks,”
and he added that it was rare for
a draftee to work for military
intelligence.

“That was really strange for a
draftee,” he said. “Only two out
of well over 200 men in my
training company were draftees.

“I found that the Army makes

the best use of your talents,” he _
said. “Enlisted men got to pick

Itheir duties]. I had a college
education. Most in my company
had hi gh-school diplomas at best.”
While he served in Pittsburgh,
Houston had an apartment in
Squirrel Hill and did not have to
wear a uniform to work. ,
“It was just another job,” he

said. “In retrospect, it was a good ‘

two years for me. By Army

standards, I did quite well. Now

Week

Continued from page 1
I’ve donated; my wallet is a little
lighter from ﬂower sales and fund
raisers, and I’ve gotten a few
more wrinkles from staying up
late at night, but it is well worth
it.”

Betsy Southorn, overall co-
chairwoman, said, “It is
misleading to say that this is the
beginning of Greek Week,
because 90 percent of the work
has already been completed.”

Dave Dombrowak, a
representative from St. Francis
Medical Center “Courage to Come
Back" campaign, spoke of raising
awareness of what the Pitt Greeks
have done for many local
charities. He also spoke
specifically about the support that
the Greeks have given to the
hospital in particular.

Aslide show was also presented
by St. Francis and Kim Cochran,
a recipient of last year’s “Courage

to Come Back” award and former
president of Delta Zeta, spoke to
the audience.

Dave Edmunds from Central
Blood Bank said, “We’re really
proud to be the newest sponsor
of Greek Week. In the past ﬁve
days, 851 units of blood were
drawn, and since 1984, 10,976
units of blood have been donated

I by Greeks.”

Jimmy Roach of Magic 97 FM
commended the Greeks for their
efforts. “You guys have guts,”
Roach said, “It kind of makes me
feel guilty to sit behind a mike
every day.”

Bob O’Conner of Roy Rogers
also commended the Greeks. “I’m
very honored to be associated
with the ‘Courage to Come Back’
campaign and the Pitt Greeks for
the past several years. It’s been
like watching your kids start to
walk. They crawl, then they walk,
then they start to run.”

Draft

Continued from page 3
I probably would have different
thoughts.”

However, some men were not
affected by the first TV war and
wanted to see combat. Often these
were the ones who enlisted before
they could be drafted.

“We all knew guys like that,
gung—ho types,” said Misuraca.
“They still exist. You see them in
the movies; there’s always one
‘kill—a-gook—for—Christ’ guy. The
’60s didn’t affect all of us."

However, as the casualties
continued to rise, people became
less willing to enlist and more
opposed to the draft. However,
despite ’60s folklore, not many
people were willing to leave the
country to avoid the draft.

“Actually, Iknew several people
only vaguely who went to Canada
or Sweden,” said Murphy. “[It

     

was] not very common. I have no
idea what the numbers were, but
there was more talk [than actually
going abroad]. It’s a very
frightening thing to do.”

According to Murphy, draft
dodgers left the United States
assuming they could never return.

“It wasn’t until President Carter
had announced the amnesty [in
1977] that there was any talk of
them coming back at all,” she
said. “More people just tried not
to be ﬁndable. You'd leave
whatever address was your last
one and live in a commune or in
the wilderness somewhere.”

For most people, however,
student deferments were a more
practical choice. According to
Giangarlo, the enrollment at Ohio
University, where she did her
undergraduate work, swelled
from 12,000 to 17,000 during the

war.

“People were saying, ‘Hey, I'd
better go to college; it’s better
than the war,’ and they were
right,” she said. “lDormitoryl
rooms that should have been
doubles became quads, and no
one cared, because it was safe.”

“It was probably the biggest
decision that any thinking male
was forced to make,” said

Misuraca. “No matter what you O

thought of the war, your view
changed when you were the one
who would be drafted.”

More to Greeks than parties

When people hear the word “fraternity,’,’ they usually
conjure up an image of wild, all—night parties with toga-
clad college students drinking from beer bongs. Surely,

5 , this Animal House image probably does more to attract
_ students to the fraternity scene than drive them away.

However, Greek Week. does justice to claims by frater-
nities and sororities that there is much more to Greeks

5‘ than just guzzling beer.

Much time and preparation goes into Greek Week. Since
1952, fraternities and sororities have participated in the
annual Greek Week events. The sponsors for this year’s
events are Roy Rogers Family Restaurants, Central Blood
Bank, Str-oh’s Brewery and Cameron Coca-Cola. ,

The Greeks hope to raise $l00,000'this year for St.
Francis Medical Center's “Courage to Come Back” cam-
paign through a dance marathon and canning for money.
The Greeks have decided to open the dance marathon to
all Pitt students this year (formerly it had been an

A exclusively Greek event). This is a very novel idea,

considering that the minimum donation for participation
in the marathon is $35. Allowing a larger pool of partici-
pants should enable the Greeks to collect a decent amount
of money this year, perhaps more than usual, which in

effect should make the $100,000 target easier to meet.

Among the other Greek Week events are the “god and
goddess” competition, a “parade of letters,” a toga com-
petition, a formal, a chariot race and a Greek Sing, among

_ others.

Many of the fondest memories of Pitt alumni are
connected to the memories and experiences they had as
members of a fraternity or sorority. By lending a helping
hand to the local hospitals and the community during
Greek Week, Pitt Greeks will make a lasting impression
upon members of the community and, most importantly,
on the hospitals that will benefit from money raised during
the week. - A

Greek Week has always been, and apparently will
continueto be, a time for the University of Pittsburgh

‘ fraternities and sororiticstto show the community that

there is more to Greek life than wild parties and saving
seats at Pitt Stadium.

March 18, 1990 marked a his-
toric day in German history.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s politi-
cal party, the Christian Demo-1
crats and their allied political
parties received over 40 percent
of the popular vote in East Ger-
man elections. This has clearly
given Kohl a mandate to proceed
with German unification. His
party has favored a fast unifica-
tion of the two Germanies, while
the Social Democratic Party, his
opposition, has favored unifica-
tion at a much slower rate.

There is, however, much anxi-
ety in Europe over German uni-
fication. And in some cases,
justifiably so. However, this does
not give anyone the right to stand
in the way of German unifica-
tion. The division of Germany
has been an artificial arrange-
ment and legacy of the Cold War.
The language, culture and«his—
tory (prior to World War II) of
both countries is the same.
Germany was a unified country
from 1871 to 1945 and in various
lesser forms and alliances be fore- _
hand. The fear of unification is
rooted in Germany’s history as a
continental power.

The Poles have a genuine rea-

son to be concerned with this;

they fear annexation of parts of
their country by Germany. After
World War II, the Polish border
was moved eastward to the Oder
and Neisse Rivers to compensate

.for land in eastern Poland that

was annexed by the Soviet Un-
ion. This left many Germans in
Poland on traditional German
lands as a minority in a foreign
country. Subsequently, they were
forcibly expelled by the Commu-
nists.

Although World War II, the
annexation of Polish lands by the
Soviet Union, the incorporation
ofGerman lands into Poland and
the expulsion of Germans from
Poland were all unfortunate
events, there is no reason why

anything should be changed.
The former Polish lands are
now nationalistically Lithuanian,
Byelorussian, Ukrainian and
Russian. And the former German
lands are now nationalistically
Polish. All boundary disagree-
ments were solved by the signing

    

    
Grecich

of the Helsinki Accords which
recognized all existing borders in
Europe as legal.

Germany has no justifiable legal
or national claims to Poland
whatsoever. Kohl has ﬁnally
come to this realization. He
originally stated that the German
state lies within its pre-World
War II boundaries. This would
extend Germany to the Soviet
frontier. It now seems most
probable that Kohl was using this
merely as election rhetoric to
secure the votes of the extreme
right wing in East German elec-
tions.

The claims of Great Britain,
France and the Soviet Union
against German unification are
weak. While all countries have
twice been to war with Germany
in this century, they incorrectly
parallel the Germany of today
with that of yesterday. Germany
now has a history of democracy,
and most of the people who lived
through Hitler's Third Reich are
long since gone. Those who lived

Formulations on reuniﬁcation

through and remember this pe-
riod firsthand constitute only a
small number.

It is, however, a period which
cannot be forgotten. It has been
hard for Germany to come to
terms with its bloody pasttin
which millions of innocent people

were killed in the name of a
psychotic leader. But it has suc-
cessfully done so and has flour-
ished under democracy and
become an economic power and
respected nation.

This is what the Soviet Union,
Great Britain and France fear.
Germany’s economy will obvi-
ously be stronger than those of
Great Britain or France. And the
last thing the Soviet Union needs
is another stronger economic
power in Europe which will
further hinder its inﬂuence.

Germany, both East and West,
must decide its own fate. It
should, however, guarantee

Poland that the existing bounda-
ries are legal, and that no aspira-
tions exist to change them. Eu-
rope should come to the “realiza-
tion that some of its own eco-
nomic deficiencies should not

halt German uniﬁcation. If any-’

thing, it should cause them to

,work harder to improve their

own.

And finally, the United States
and the Soviet Union should,
upon reunification, formally plan
to remove troops and weapons
from Germany. Germany should
remain a member of NATO if it so
chooses, but perhaps in the sov-
ereign form in which France —-
who has no foreign troops or
weapons within its boundaries
-— does. Germany as a member
of NATO will deter any imperial-
istic tendencies that Germany
could possibly develop. In light
of that thought, a NATO—mem-
bered Germany would actually
be beneficial to the Soviet Union.

The government should privatize the US postal service

The U. S. Postal Service has
recently announced a proposal
to increase the price of first-class
mail from 25 to 30 cents. Natu-
rally, consumers have been voic-
ing their complaints. Businesses
that mail rnillions of pieces of
mail a year have been particu-
larly outspoken about this. J

On a recent news program,
“consumer advocate” Ralph
Nader stated that the U.S. Postal
Service simply needs to be more
efficient and responsible. Oth-
ers, those who truly care about
consumers, have been calling
for privatization as something
that would give us better mail
service. I

I am one person who wants
the delivery of first-class mail to
be privatized. Like other advo-
cates of privatization, I believe
that private companies could do
a better job of mail delivery than

our government post office. If
different companies competed in
an open marketplace, each
company would do things to
attract customers. The customer
would choose whatever company
he or she thought had the best
service at the best price.

Critics of privatization argue
that the consumer would be hurt
by such a thing. They argue that
small towns would not be served
by private post offices. These
people fail to understand" how a
free market works. A free market
exempt from government inter-
ference will provide a supply

I wherever there is a demand.

There are plenty of commercials
on television where United Par-
cel Service, a private company
that delivers packages, promises
that if you have an address, they
will deliver to it. Private post
offices could do the same thing

with first-class mail.

What is basically going on is an
argument between two factions:
those who want private post
offices for the delivery of first-

Daniel
Alman

class mail and those who don’t
want private post offices. Each
side has been voicing different
reasons to support their argu-
ments. However, there is one
rarely mentioned argument to
support privatization that, in my
opinion, beats all opposing argu-
ments. «

My argument is the argument
for freedom. Right now in the
United States, there are federal
laws that make it illegal for any
private company. to deliver first-

class mail. Anybody who tries to
start a company to do this can be
put in jail. This is a tremendous
violation of our freedom.

Our founding fathers wanted a
government-run post office; Ar-
ticle 1, Section 8 of the
Constitution contains a clause
stating this. However, they never
said anything about outlawing
private ones. It was not until the

19th century that such laws came

. into existence. Since then, if a-

person peacefully attempts to start
a business delivering first-class
mail, he or she is a criminal.

There are certain actions that a
person should be punished for.
For example, if a person steals a
car, then that person should be
placed in jail. However, there is
absolutely no reason why a per-
son should be punished for
operating a privatecompany to
deliver first—class mail.

Those who are against privati-
zation are basically saying that
running a private post office
should be a crime. They have no
understanding whatsoever of how T
a free society operates.

A free society can only exist
when each individual is free to
make his or her own choices

about how‘ to live his or her own 
interactions between “X ,

life. All
individuals should be conducted,
on a voluntary basis. O ‘ ‘
V Ifl want to deliver the mail of
a customer who is willing to pay
me for it, then I should be al-
lowed to do so. At the present, I
would be put behind bars for
such an activity.

Let’s end this nonsense and le-
galize the delivery of first—class
mail by private companies. Let's
make this country a freer place to
live!

Pondering government issues with the vice president

Vice President Dan Quayle was
unavailable for comment‘ last
week. But he happens to be a
personal friend of mine.

Still, I wasnt on the guest list
for the Republican dinner at the
Westin William Penn Hotel (an
oversight, I’m sure), and I had a
little trouble at the door.

I recognized The Pitt News
reporter assigned to cover the
story, and I asked him» why he
wasn’t inside where the action
was.

“They won’t let, me in,” he
explained, pointing at the Secret
Servicemen guarding the door. ,

“Who them?” I asked. “What
are they going to do to you?
They're Republicans. Look at
them -—- they aren’t even young
Republicans.”

“They have guns,” he ex-
plained.

“Oh, well, that could present a
problem.” . _ _

As I approached the door, one
of the men put his arm out,
blocking my entry.

“Where do you think you're
going. lady?" he asked me.

“That ain't no lady,” The Pitt _

News reporter called out; “"I"hat«*s

I explained that I’d simply

didn’t believe my story. I was sort
of desperate, so I had to resort to
a pretty slimy trick. ’ '

“Hey!” I shouted, pointing to a
man across the street. “Isn’t that
Lee Harvey Oswald?”

And as they raced after him, I
slipped inside. M

I spotted Danny right away. He
had the dance ﬂoorth. himself. I
approached him. J

“Dan, Dan, what. the hell are
you doing? This is disgraceful!”

He had an American flag neck-
tie around his forehead. He was
shaking his rumpa to a‘ Larnbada
version of the Rolling ‘Stones’

, “Angie.” » . I

“Well, geez, I'm just dancing,

flopping: around.

“Reipublicans don’t dance,” I
told him.

“Sure they do.”

“No, I‘ don’t think so. Besides,
this isn’t exactly a dance’ track.”

We sat down’ at the bar.

“Ice cream and soda, straight
up, please,” Dan said, giggling
like a madman. 1

“I’ve been meaning to talk to
you, Dan. I think we have a bit of
a problem.”

“What’s up?”

“Well, I’m wondering what you
Republicans are planning to do
about the System." . ..

“Well, that's easy. George and
I plan‘ to keep up the good work.”.

Letter writers digging into pros and cons of 

In reference to the March 22
article concerning the harassment
of Vice President Dan Quayle, I
would like to make a few com-
ments. I can now appreciate what
Barry Goldwater meant when he
wrote in Conscience of aMajon'ty
that conservatives held a true
majority in America, and that
they simply were quiet and

I composed people who were

willing to let the left-wingers
grab all the headlines. After see-
ing the events of March 22, I
would like to invite all conserva-
tives to stand up, be counted and
show people like Jay Katz and
Jeanne Clark who really mirrors
American public opinion. ‘
To Miss Clark, 1 have this to
say: you’ve once again proven
your lack of class. In the past,
you’ve threatened political op-

ponents with trumped-up, un- ’

proven allegations of supposed
abortions performed for preg-
nant relatives of pro-life activists.
Four weeks ago, you made crude
references that condemned en-
tire religions by referring to clergy

members as child molesters, even
though clergy members involved
in this wouldn’t even make up
[.01] percent of all clergy mem-
bers. Personally, I think it’s
“outrageous” to want to hear,
even for free, the bigoted and
disgusting rantings of a loser like
yourself who has never had the
respect of anyone beyond the
lunatic fringe.

ToJay Katz, I would like to ask A

that you refrain from bitching
about Quayle until you and your
yearly facade of a homeless
“shanty” that usually is teeming
with portable CD players, Walk-
mans, portable heaters and
mounds of “O” fries and Perrier.
Go back to your ivory towers of
the Free University Drivel and
leave those of us with cerebral
matter alone.

To the pinhead who hinted
about burning Kevin Dougherty’s
American flag, I wouldlike to
remind you that this wouldn’t be
tolerated by most in this commu-
nity, and you know it. I think an
insignificant nerd like yourself

would be smart enough not to
carry out this threatened action.
However, if you ever do get the
urge to burn an American flag, I
suggest that you hope and pray
that I don’t see it.

Finally, I’d like to say that myself

and millions ofothers are tired of
hearing the mush-minded elitists
of this country trying to brain-
wash America into hating a man
because of his conservative poli-
tics. If Quayle were a liberal
Democrat, he would never have
his talents questioned. A case in
point: Geraldine, Ferraro, a no-
body with a coke—dealing son
and stupidity as her greatest
political virtue. How about Jesse
Jackson, that all-too—well-known
chicken-hawk demagogue who
calls people racists while frolick-
ing with Louis Farrakhan and
referring to Jews as “Hymies”?

Tom Lester
CA5 ‘91

In the March 12 edition of The
Pitt News, Lou Grieco wrote a

biased article about the Dan
Quayle story. He gave Mr. Dough-
erty and the Young Republicans
more coverage than they de-
served. The people who pro-
tested at Westin William Penn
Hotel had every right, even
though Mr. Dougherty thought
they were wrong in protesting. If
you were on strike, would you
go back to work with a 50- per-
cent pay cut with a poorly man-
aged company that was bought
in a leveraged buyout and had
the blessing of the president and

Grieco ask any of the union
people why theywere there? Mr.
Dougherty tells Mr. Grieco they
(the protestors) do not need any

Flag-waving people, like Mr.
Dougherty and the like, get caught
up in the flag wavingwith hypoc-
risy against the First Amendment.

The Bush Administration is “in

the union. If I were ﬂying Eastern

Eastern and Continental Airlines,
are second-rate compared to the

LOS ANGIiI.I~ZS — What makes
Loyola run? I

A full dose of full-court
pressure, an unshakable three-
point stance, an unconditional
surrender to the great god of
conditioning and, above all, the
helping hand of the late Hank
Gathers turned Loyola
Marymount into the darling of
the NCAA Tournament.

They’re the ‘hottest thing since
the Lambada, these Lions.

CBS had its cameras trained on
them‘; an entire nation was rooting
for them, and the Final Four was
calling to them.

They needed to win one more
game to reach Denver — Sunday
against Nevada-Las Vegas.

After what the 25-5 Lions did in '

the first two rounds at Long Beach
last weekend, who would dare
call it an upset if they made it—
even though there are many who
feel UNLV is the favorite for the
entire tournament?

But the Runnin’ Rebels ended
the Lions’ quest for the Final Four
yesterday by handing them a
131-101 thrashing. 8

Still, it was the Lions’ game
plan which got them as far as
they went.

“I don’t know that I’ve ever
seen a college team play any
better,” Arizona Coach Lute Olson
said after watching the Lions set
tournament records for scoring
and three—pointers’ made and
attempted (2l—Of-/IO) in a1/19-115
wipe out of defending national
champion Michigan‘.

“’lhe_ way they’re playing, I
don’t know if anyone can match
up with them, including the lLos
Angelesl Lakers. It’s unbelievable

to watch them shoot the ball 
almost eerie."

The secret of Loyola’s success
is in the system. It is basketball

the way practically every

youngster in the street wants to

play it — fast, free and easy.
But it also is basketball with a

purpose. Coach Paul Westhead

Colorado St. atnav

sees to that.

Westhead —— who, irony of
ironies, was fired by the Lakers
nine years ago for running an
offense his players considered
too structured — has become
the new guru of the running
game, which many consider the
most unstructured form of

basketball offense.

However, there’s a method to
Loyola’s mania.

True, the Lions move the ball
upcourt at light speed every time
they touch it, even after made
baskets.

True, their players are free to
put it up just about anywhere and

David Schuff/The Pitt News

anytime they feel the urge.

But this is not street ball. The
run—and—fun Loyola offense may
be predicated on a no-guilt
commitment to the three—point
shot, but there is an order and
organization to the way the Lions
run their frenetic fast break.

‘Doc’ Medich fulfilled multiple roles in modern style

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

In the world of sports today,
athletes who compete in two
sports are becoming more
common. Bo Jackson and Deion
Sanders split their year between
the baseball diamond and the
NFL, and Michael Jordan plans
on joining the PGA after retiring
from the NBA.

Pitt has its share of athletes
filling dual roles also. For instance,
tailback Curvin Richards is batting
.333 for the Panther baseball team
after rushing for over 1,000 yards
last fall, and former punter John
Rasp just finished his third season
with the basketball team.

In the recent past, Billy Osborn

’ played baseball, basketball and

football at various points in his
career from 1985-88. Even
Olympic gold medalist Roger
Kingdom played football for Pitt
in 1982; But perhaps the best
two-sport athlete Pitt ever had
was George Francis Medich.

Better known as “Doc” Medich.
Twenty years ago this summer,
the tall, lanky, crewcut—topped,
right-handed pitcher finished up
a standout baseball career with
the Panthers. His career figures
of 13-6 with 153 strikeouts in
three varsity seasons are modest
figures by today’s big-time
collegiate standards. But they rank
third all-time for the Panthers,
who were (and still are) a modest
team, averaging 12 wins and
seven losses from 1968-70.

Medich came to Pitt on a
football scholarship and was a
standout for Panther football
teams that were not outstanding.
Pitt went 6-24 while Medich, an
offensive end, pulled in 91
receptions, placing him second
on the all-time list in the category
at the time. (He currently ranks
10th.)

“He is one of the best baseball
players to come out of the
Pittsburgh area. In fact, he might
have been one of the best football
players in the area, but his heart

was in baseball," said Ray
Radakovich, a former Pitt football
teammate of Medich’s.

Baseball was Medich’s love,
and it was his mound talent that
raised the interest of a few major-
league scouts. Most had heard
that he planned on entering Pitt’s
medical school in the fall,
however, so they shied away.

The phone rang one June day,
however, and the New York
Yankees were on the line. Medich
had been selected in the 29th
round of the amateur draft.

But not being used to having
just one “hobby,” Medich enrolled
in med school and signed a pro-
baseball contract, reporting to
Oneonta, N.Y., of the New York
Penn League in the summer of
1970 and to Pitt Medical School
that fall.

Thus began a 13-year journey,
in which Medich walked a
tightrope, a precarious balance
between baseball and medicine,
two fields so widely different that
they complemented each other.

“They are so different, but they
kind of evened themselves out. I
would get sick of playing baseball,
and I’d be ready to study, but
then after a few months, I'd be
ready to play ball again. I did that
for 10 years," Medich said.

“Doc” Medich, as he came to
be known, made it to “The
Show” at the end of 1972 and
stayed there for a decade,
compiling a 124-105 record with
the Yankees, Pittsburgh Pirates,
Oakland A’s, Seattle Mariners,
New York Mets, Texas Rangers
and Milwaukee Brewers.

Dr. Medich, as he also came to
be known, was certified by the
American Medical Association in
1980, is now an orthopedic
surgeon and practices at the
Medical Center of Beaver and
Aliquippa Hospital.

“I didn’t go to college to play
football or baseball,” Medich said.
“I went to college to go to medical
school.”

For Medich, baseball was not
an end, but a means to an end. A

simple game that allowed him to
make a-living while still in med
school.

And football?

“Football served its purpose. It
paid my way through [undergrad]
school,” Medich said simply.

Medich went to Pitt Medical
School during the winter, and
pitched baseball games during
the summer, fulfilling a statement
he once made while toiling in the
minor leagues.

“I’d love to make it to the major
leagues someday. I think it would
be a neat summer job,” he said.

Take that Bo, Jackson.

“Yeah, I said that,” chuckled
Medich, “and I did it for 10 years
too."

“To accomplish what he did in
football, baseball and medical
school, you know he had to
make sacrifices,” said Pitt’s
baseball coach of 35 years, Bobby
Lewis.

“That's a hard trick, but if "'
_ anyone could have done it, it was

See Medich, page 10.

And everything depends on a
structurally sound full—court press
that might be the most effective
to hit college hoops since the
early days of the John Wooden
dynasty at UCLA.

The Lions do surrender a few
layups when the press gets
broken, but they more than make
up for it with press-induced
turnovers that create flurries of
easy points on dunks, layins and
threes — the kind of scoring
binges that break an opponent's
spirit.

In their 111-92 first—round
victory over New Mexico State,
the Lions outscored the Aggies
28-6 in the first six minutes of the
second half. In the second half

against Michigan they went 11-0
in 1:10 and 9-0 in 54 seconds.

“We may not be a great
defensive team,” Westhead said,
“but the defense serves the
offense. The way we play defense,
you almost can’t avoid playing
fast againstus. Our defense makes
the game go fast."

It also makes the game, in
Westhead’s words, “a joy” for the
players. Run, shoot, score. Is there
any youngster on any playground
in America who wouldn’t like to
do that for four years?

Jeff Fryer, Loyo1a’s most
shameless three-point
bombardier, could be speaking
for the entire team when he
explains his philosophy:

“I keep missing shots until I

make one, then I keep making
shots until I miss one. It’s the best
system I could ever imagine. Like
playing in heaven.”

Even so, it takes a special brand
of player to ﬂourish in Westhead’s
world —— one with the quickness
of a hummingbird and the
endurance of a camel.

In the rush to credit “the
scheme,” as Westhead calls it, it’s
easy to underestimate the Lions’
talent. But there’s more to this
team than Bo Kimble (the national
scoring leader), Jeff Fryer and a
bunch of Joes.

Sixth man Terrell Lowery is
one of the quickest guards in the
nation (did you see him blowing
by Rumeal Robinson last
Sunday?).

Swedish import Per Stumer is
deadly beyond the three-point
arc.

Stringbean center Chris Knight,
point guard Tony Walker and
floorburn king Tom Peabody are
working definitions of the
unselfish role-player.

They’re all in tip-top shape,
and Westhead juggles them in a
freestyle substitution rotation that
seems to keep everyone fresh.

“To run up and down the court _

for 40 minutes and not get tired,
that’s a tribute to their stamina
and conditioning,” Alabama
forward Keith Askins said.

The Lions’ emotional condition
has been as significant a factor as
any, of course.

The March 4 death of star center
Hank Gathers, who collapsed
from heart failure during a game,
has turned into a rallying point
for the team. From tragedy they
have found triumph.

“The way we play, our all-out
style, that emotion has really
helped us,” said Kimble, Gathers’
longtime friend. “And it will
continue to be with us throughout
the tournament.”

“Our guys are so relaxed now
that numbers-wise, there’s no
limit,” Westhead said.

Maybe next year.

Bernardino Sun).

George,” said Radakovich, “What
made it even more impressive is
that back then Pitt wasn’t a public
school; it was private, and the

‘ entrance requirements were a lot
tougher.

“If that were to happen today
[an athlete going to medical
school], there would be an
announcement in the paper;
they'd» bring out the brass band
and everything,” Radakovich
added. _

After making the majors,
Medich ‘twice got a chance to
cross his talents and show that all
athletes aren’t “dumb jocks.”

In 1976, while playing for the
Pirates in Philadelphia, Medich
noticed a fan slumped in his seat.
“There was no one else around,
so I ran over to him,” said Medich,
who attempted in vain to
resuscitate the man. “I heard that
he died [after being taken to a
hospital], but nothing else,”
Medich said.

Two years later in Baltimore,
Medich.._was a Texas Ranger and
heardra request for a physician
over the. loudspeaker, so he.
answered the call. I

“A, man had had a heart attack,
sol ran over and [helped himl,”
said Medich, “and he recovered,
I do believe.” Medich never heard
from theman again.

Medich ﬁnished his career in
1982 after being traded from Texas

. to the Milwaukee Brewers during

the pennant chase. The Brewers
won the pennant that year before
losing to St. Louis in the World
Series. Medich pitched in one
game in the Series, giving up four

, runs in two innings in a 13-1

Cardinal blowout in Game Six.

‘‘I hadn’t pitched in 17 days
before that, so my arm wasn’t in
the best of shape,” Medich said.
“But I hada chance to play in the
World Series; I had done
everything that I wanted to in
baseball. They were going to
offer me a contract for the next
year, but I told themnot to bother.
I had had enough.”

Medich was through with
baseball, but baseball wasn’t
through with him. Stress that had
accrued over the years now reared
its ugly head in the form of
Percodan tablets, an addictive
prescription drug that Medich
wrote and filled false prescriptions
for himself at an Oakland
pharmacy in .1983. He was

arrested and pleaded guilty.

Medich . was given- two years.

‘ probation and put up for review

by the Medical Education and
Licensure Board, which he
passed.

“lThatlmay not have happened

do [combine careers], if there
hadn’t been all the stress
involved, " Medich told the Dallas

Times Herald in 1983.

“He was just trying to stay
awake,” said Lewis. “He tried to
fit a 24-hour day into an eight-
hour work day.”

That was a million years ago
now to Medich, who refuses to
talk about the subject, but did say
that he would still try both careers
again if he had to start over.

Today, Medich prefers a quieter
existence out of the limelight. He
never goes to the ball park
anymore and rarely hears from
ex—teammates. He’s never played
in an oldtimer’s game, but has
played in several charity golf
tournaments.

“With my job, I don’t have a lot
of time to get away to do those
things. They’ve asked, but I
haven’t been able to,” Medich
said.

“I just want to take care of

people, pay my bills, retire and
live happily ever after,” he added.

been. a bumpy , one,., b.ut.._ he
wouldn’t discourage anyone from

ambitions and your goals, where
you stand academically. Ask
yourself the tough questions.”

Tactics over talent almost makes Minnesota a winner

If there was ever a game that
was a study in contrasts, it was
yesterday's contest featuring the
Yellow Jackets of Georgia Tech
against the Minnesota Golden
Gophers.

Raw talent met excellent

5 coaching. And for a while, it

looked like the coaching might
prevail.

For the entire first half,
Minnesota was able to control
the tempo: looking for the open
shot (and getting it), controlling
the offensive boards and
consistently pushing to the hoop.

Gopher standout Willie “Lavar”
Burton was able to score from

the perimeter, and big man Kevin
Lynch was able to throw a monkey
wrench into the inside game of
the Yellow Jackets.

Minnesota’s slow, methodical
pace bafﬂed the jackets in the
first half, and one began to get
the feeling that if Minnesota could
continue to control the tempo,
we might be in for another major
upset in this year’s tournament.
Upsets seem to be the norm rather
than the exception. (Who out
there had Arkansas in the Final
Four?)

As the game went on, I started
to look around my house for
anything that was maroon and

yellow, much like last year when
I looked for Halloween orange

and black clothes when Princeton .

was in the midst of upsetting

Mike
Rampa

highly ranked Georgetown.
Anyway, my excitement was
quickly quelled midway through
the second half when the Jackets
started the run—and-gun.
Where would Georgia Tech be
without Dennis Scott? Scott

pumped in a cool 40 points during
the contest. In fact, the team
picture should have had the rest
of the Jackets perched on top of
Scott’s shoulders.

Not to .leave anyone else
without credit, Kenny Anderson
posted his share of points and
battled it out inside to grab some
crucial rebounds, and he hustled
to produce important turnovers.

But the main key in the second
half was the wide—open game
this turned out to be.

Minnesota’s game plan went
to the dogs, as the Jackets picked
it up a notch or two and just
started doing what they do best;

shooting.

The game was close the entire
way, and Burton gave the
Gophers new hope with less than
a minute left.

With Minnesota down by ﬁve,
Burton sunk a three—pointer with
a man down his throat to pull the
Gophers back to within two. If he
hadn’t made that shot, it would
have been all over.

But what sunk Minnesota was
the fact that it had used all of its
timeouts.

Tech sunk its last basket with
about seven seconds to go, and
the Gophers could do nothing to
stop the clock. What a nail—biter.

Volleyball club annihilates Slippery Rock in easy match ,

By John Iabriola
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s volleyball club
grounded the Rockets of Slippery
Rock University on Sunday and
took the match by posting a 3-0
shutout at Trees Hall.

The Slippery Rock squad was
at an obvious disadvantage, being
that it had only brought six of its
20 players along, while Pitt was
able to supply a constant stream
of fresh players throughout the
match.

“A couple of the guys we
substituted in don’t normally get
to play,” said Coach Steve

 
   
 

BOUGHT
TO YOU
BY:

Hoffman. “They’re extra excited
and will play that much harder.

“I enjoy watching different
players get into the lineup; it
perks the team up a little bit,”
added Hoffman.

The Panthers were expecting a
workout from the Rock, but it
turned out to be the other way
around.

“They are usually better than
that,” said Thom McClain, a
sophomore and middle blocker
for the Panthers.“We we re
expecting a more competitive
match, but they didn’t have any
backups, so we didn’t have to hit
as hard, and we had fresh guys

coming in off of the bench.”

Although the Panthers were
missing a few of their starters,
they were able to dominate.

“We came out and got them
down right away and didn’t let
them get into the game at all,”
said Hoffman.

The Panthers opened the first
game on the offensive and won
by a score of 15—9.

“We were able to run a lot of
our plays really well,” said junior
middle blocker Val Pennington.
“They really weren’t putting the
ball down a lot, and usually they
were just rolling the ball over the
net, so they allowed us to run a

lot of our offense.”

During the second game, the
Panthers scratched out a 15-13
victory.

The majority of this game the
Panthers played in the net, which
caused them to continuously lose
their serves.

“We had our share of nets, but
no more than normal,” said

9 sophomore setter Pete Vitti.

“Our offense was on. We were
very loose today, looser than
normal, but our passing was on,
and once you get the passing, it's
easy to set and easy to hit.
Everything seemed to be on today;
we just had a nice smooth flow,”

Vitti added.

“The reason we were on the
net was in part that we don’t
work walking drills as much as
we ought to,” said Hoffman. “We
try to concentrate more on the
other aspects because we don’t
have the whole team together tc
work on it.”

The Panthers opened the third
and final game of the match
serving and quickly jumped to a
5-0 lead. The Rock then began to
make a comeback to tie the score
at five.

The Panther’s next home match
will be against Allegheny College
on Sunday, April 1 at 10 a.m.
