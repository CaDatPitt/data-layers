Quintuplets!

 

Trosen Acts As Godfather
To New PiKA Arrivals

Callander, Ontario, has noth-
ing on the Pi Kappa Alpha frat
house.

Since last Monday, the PiKA
boys have been proudly raving
about the arrival of quintuplets
at their house, climaxing weeks
of anxious waiting. Bill Trosen,
ex-C37, godfathers the quints, by
virtue of his having presented
the mother to the house.

Jughaid, PiKA mascot for the
last two years, presented the
{raters with five assorted kittens
at the unearthly hour of 1:13
o'clock, Monday morning. Two of
the new arrivals are gray and
white, two are black and white,
and the fifth resembles one of its
jungle relatives in color.

Mamma and the young ’uns
are doing well, according to
latest reports.

Mrs. S tarre tt
Finishes Book

Official University History
To Be Issued In June

 

 

Publication date is June ‘9, coinci-
ding with the sesquicentennial cele-
bration, for the new history of the
University, ‘-‘Through One Hundred
and Fifty Years-—The University of
Pittsburgh,” it was announced today.

Mrs. Agnes Lynch Starrett, assist-
ant professor of English and the au-
thor of this 500-page volume, is now
busily reading proof on the text of
the book, which went to the printer
on March 15.

‘Ever since the fall of 1935, when
research was begun among old rec-
ords, books, and other sources, Mrs.
Starrett has been devoting her full
time to the history. The actual writing
of the book engaged her time from
February, 1936, to February, 1937.

An Absorbing Task

“Writing the history of the Univer-
sity has been an absorbing and an
interesting task,” Mrs. Starrett de-
clared. “No one could write this his-
tory without gratitude for the oppor-
tunity to live for several months in
a world of courage in the face of fre-
quent disappointment, of steady hope
for better living and of achievement,
dramaticand enduring. The people
and the things they have done are
the history of Pittsburgh as well as
the history of the University.”

The book will be printed in a tall
octavo and will include 40 pages of
illustrations as well as its 500 pages
of text. Old fashioned caslon type,
characteristic of early Western Penn-
sylvania printers, will be used through-
out the book, which will be printed
on antique ﬁnish rag paper.

Among the illustrations of the vol-
ume will be many old and new por-
traits, documents and scenes, depict-
ing the development of the University
and of Pittsburgh. They will be repro-

duced in full aquatone.

Editors Vote ‘Yes’

 

The following resolutions, passed
unanimously by delegates of the In-
tercollegiate Newspaper Association
at Philadelphia last Saturday, urged
that the granting of aid to students
for other than purely scholastic ac-
complishments be openly recognized
and supported. The resolutions were
introduced by Stanley Finkel, edi'tor,
The Johns Hopkins News-Letter, Johns
Hopkins University.

RESOLUTION No. 1

Whereas, the INA has shown it-
self to stand for a progressive pol-
icy, and

Whereas it is agreed that ﬁnan-
eial aid has been and is being given
to students for“ other than purely
scholastic attainments, and

Whereas the giving of this finan-
cial aid in’ question has been dis-
guised, concealed. and denied, and

Whereas we deem this condition
to be unbealthful, undesirable, hyp-
ocritical and conducive to unintelli-
gent consideration of the funda»
mental problems involved;

Be it hereby resolved that the
INA go on record as advocating the
complete and open staternent of
subsidization and recommend to
each of the member colleges and
universities that this conditioil be
corrected. _ ‘ ’

RESOLUTION No. 2

Whereas, the INA has gone on rec-
ord as favoring the disclosure of in-
formation concerning the granting of
aid to students for purposes not
purely scholastic, and

Whereas, we believe that a well-
rounded education is one which
stresses not only scholastic achieve-
ment, but also offers and encourages
extra-curricular and other cultural
activities, and. -_

Whereas, we consider the disclosure
of this information vital if our uni-
versities and colleges are to lay claim
to progressive, intelligent, and en-
lightened policies, and.

Whereas an intelligent and open
consideration of the problem is valu-
able and necessary ifthg p},fope1*j;y'pes

Hold Ideal
Legislature
S t a 1‘ k Selected Permanent

Chairman Of Sessions
At Capital Conclave

 

HARRISBURG, April 10.--
Seven University students joined 319
other delegates at the Intercollegiate
Conference on Government to span-
sor liberal legislation for the model
legislature which concluded its ses-
sions in Harrisburg yesterday after-
noon.

Early Saturday morning, William
Stark, C38, was elected speaker of
the unicameral body. The conference
composed of delegates from 32
Pennsylvania colleges advocated ap-

’p1*oximatel_v 100 bills, chief of which
‘was a. motion to construe sit-down

strikes as legal.

Introduced by Temple University,
it was defeated, brought back for re-
consideration, and defeated again by
a 90-91 roll call vote. The assembly
agreed to outlaw company unions,
create a new Public Utilities Com-
mission with greater power, and to
advocate widespread changes in the
present public school system.

The proposed changes include a
central school system, increase in
salaries for teachers, a greater cur-
ricular program, the adoption of an
18-year minimum attendance law,
and the sponsorship of junior col-
leges. , .

Yesterday afternoon the group
unanimously elected "Miss Genevieve
Blatt, graduate assistant in political
science, executive director of next
year’s conference. The University
delegation attending the three-day
sessions at the capital included:
Stark; Melvin Rogow, C38; Ray
Scheib, C37; Dorotl1y'Glass, C38;
Evelyn Lovry, C38; Isabelle Broff,
C37 ; and Irving Bennett, C40.

Meeting in the majority caucus
room of the House of Representa-
tives, members opened the fourth an-
nual conclave Saturday morning at
10 o’clock. Model la‘-vs submitted in-
cluded legalized birth control, cre-
ation of a state re-employment
bureau, limitation of the issuance of
labor injunctions, and civil service
for all public school teachers.

The election of a permanent chair-
man chosen from the delegates is an
innovation to the four-year-old con-
vention. Previously, Miss Blatt and
John Bracken, C34, co-founders of
the conference, have conducted the
meetings.

This year, however, St-ark was
named ﬁrst permanent leader 'to
head the group. ‘

Prominent Labor Questions
To Be Reviewed Today

 

“The Current Labor Scene” will
be reviewed by Dr. Carroll R. Daugh-
erty, professor of economics, when he
addresses Inquiry Forum today at
12:30 o'clock in Room 10?, Alumni
Hall.

Dr. Dauglierty will analyze the
present labor situation in the United
States, touching upon its many com-
plicated angles, including sit--down
strikes, industrial unionization, the
Supreme Court-Wagner Act situation,
and other aspects of the problem.

VVO.l'lvi‘.l1Ig' as 1’eS€.'111'('ll director of la-
bor relutions for the Bureau of Busi-
ness Research, Dr. Daugherty recent-
ly prepared a report of an exhaustive
survey of the steel industry which at-
tracted nation-wide attention. The re-
port, ﬁnanced jointly by the Maurice
and Laura Falk Foundation of Pitts-
burgh and the Brookings Institute of
Washington, recommended that the
nation's steel workers be organized on
3 country-wide industrial basis for
collective bargaining.

The results of this survey have
")ecn embodied in a volume, “Eco-
Jomics of the Iron and Steel Indus-
rry,” prepared by the ‘economics pro-
fessor and others, which has just been
published.

In 1933, the speaker completed a
book, “Labor Problems in American
Industry.” He is also the author of
we chapters in the textbook, “Eco-
riomic Principles and Problems,” used
Here at the University.

Purpose of invasion was entrance
in the Grand Eastern Tournament for

Side issues to the contests included

the 600-mile trip from Pittsburgh to ,

Winthrop through the Shenandoah
Valley, ﬂowers breaking into bloom
before the eyes of the forensic com-
petitors, mules carted in lumbering
wagons, and Burma Shave signs. The
contingent was impressed by:

The cannibels took just one view

The squad was also impressed by
Southern drawls, warm sunlight, and
June weather.

Early results of competition at this
writing are uncertain. McKenna--—as
an extra-curricular competition-——won
a waltz contest with a young lady
from Virginia at the local Hollywood
Beauty Box. Thursday night Mc-
Kenna will return to Pittsburgh plus
a new pair of white sport shoes; the
young lady will go back to Virginia

As regards debating, Springer and

Queen Nominees
To Be Announced
At Afternoon Tea

 

Eight seniors will be named Senior
Queen nominees this afternoon at the
annual Coronation Tea, the Queen's
Levee, which will begin at 3 o’clock
at Heinz House with the entire senior
class in attendance.

Those women who are nominated
this afternoon will be voted upon by
members of the Senior Class at the
Women’s regular spring elections on
Wednesday. The name of the Queen
is then withheld until Spring Festi-
val Tap Day.

The women who will take part ll
the ceremony presenting the nominees
to the reigning Queen are Geraldine
Ashton, Ruth Recht, Mary Losey
Rudd, Ruth Belle Strothers, Natalie
Rosen, Alice Lewis, Charlotte Bowers.
Agnes McClain, Margaret Smith, Ed-
na Rahl, ll/Iargery McMasters, and
Phyllis Tabor.

Ruth Anderson, C36, is the presc-.nl.
Queen. According to tradition the
reigning Queen visits the campus
three times during the year; on Lan-
tern night, at the Queen’s Levee, and
at the coronation ceremony of the
new queen in June.

Following the ceremony at today's
levee, there will be a social hour.

\> Direct censorship of the editorial

and news columns of the Temple Uni-
versity News was charged by the As-
sociation. The Susquehannan, student
newspaper at Susquehanna University.
was listed for “deletion of student
copy.”

Last Wednesday's move at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh that named the
out-going editor and business man-
ager of The News to membership on
the board came after the censorship
report was drawn up. Under the re-
vised set-up, the board contains four
administrative and two student mem-
bers.

The protests were a result of the
work of the censorship investigation
committee set up at the fall conven-
tion.

Questionnaires sen't to editors and
assistants of the member papers were
the basis of the investigating com-
mittee’s report. Twenty-three of the
37 member papers responded to the
survey.

Johns Hopkins At Bat

Conditions at these three Univer-
sities formed the major complaints of
the college press group. However, in
certain other schools, situations bor-
dering on censorship were revealed
in the report. It was also approved
that the Association send letters to
Governor George H. Earle, informing
him of the charges. Two of the three
schools, Pitt and Temple, receive state
appropriations.

The association went on record as
favoring the g'1'ant.in‘g of ﬁnancial aid
to deserving students who are out-
standing in other than purely aca-
demic ﬁelds, and for the disclosure of
information concerning the granting
of such aid, by unanimously approv-
ing resolutions, introduced by Stanley
Finkel, editor of the Johns Hopkins
News-Letter, Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, to that effect.

Members of the investigating com-
mittee were; Al Postle, managing edi-
tor of the Temple News, chairman;
Joseph Winston, Jr., editor, Swarth-
more Phoenix; Priscilla Alden, editor,
West Chester Quad Angles; Alvin J.
Butz, III, editor Muhlenbergian.

Donoghue Nominated

James R. Donoghue, C38, member
of the editorial board of The Pitt
News, named by the nominating com-
mittee for the presidency of INA
along with three other delegates, lost
on a “split” vote to Howard W.
Ennes, associate editor of The Uni-
versity Hatchet, George Washington
University.

After a third ballot, necessitated
when no one candidate received a
required majority on the first two
ballots, Donoghue and Ennes tallied
an equal number of votes.

insonian, Dickinson College, retiring
president of the Association, cast the

‘ NUMBER of events occurred over the past
week-end which were ‘precedent-making from

several points of view.-A g-roupof college editors,
meeting" under the banner of the Intercollegiate

Newspaper Association _of‘the Middle Atlantic-'=

States, conferred in Philadelphia on problems
threatening journalism on the collegiate front to-
day. The main issue resolved itself, ﬁrst, around

the point of just what a collegiate newspaper -

should be, .and_next,_ on what it should do. "
If the publication is tobe a student publication,
then, it was agreed almo-st unanimously that stu-
dent opinion should be expressedin the editorial-
columns, and that there should be no direct cen-r
sorship inthe editorial ‘or news.V_fcolu_r'nns.incthe

by passing resolutions" to the effectof protesting 

three of the member papers for reasons ranging
from direct censorship in The’Tc,mple University
News to indirect control through “dict‘ato‘rial”‘

choice of: editors-in-chief of The Pitt News.

In «fairness to views expressed. or unexpressed:
at that INA convention, it should be stated that
one person, a circulation manager who was not in
agreement" with ‘ the majority staff opinion of
The Quad Angles, West Chest,er'State Teachers
College, and possibly one or two other persons

who decV1in_e_d to expresstheir ideas, upheld a dif-
ferent opinion. . ~ » ' ‘ '1 " -

He believed that a‘ college undergraduate pub-
licationshould be a “University publication” and
print only that which publicizes University events.
and makes no attempt" to include either outside-,
the-college news events or the expression of stu- -
dent opinion in editorial columns. Perhaps he
has a p_o'int.'It is not, however, apoinit with which
most student editors agree. It does not even pre-
tend-to approach an enlightened-~point of view.

If true ideals of education are to triumph, then_z__ '

our newspapers, like any other important “e‘du_-‘_
cator, must reflect honest opinion. No‘ student 1'

The editor’s only warnings and instructions to this
column have been/‘to keep ll’. clean‘ and lve always
tried to comply. Now, howcx-er, it looks as tho I'm going
to have to cut‘ loose, on a small scale, because the bran-
ley has a picture whose substance was lifted bodily
from our newspapers of a couple months ago. !

“Marked Woman” is the story of Lucky Luciano,
New '-York’s vice king, brushed up and washed out a
little but not too much. In the movies Lucky iscalled
Johnny Vanning and he is played by that most sinister
and realistic Hollywood -menace, Eduardo _C1anelli. If
you’ve read the papers you know what Luciano did; If;
you haven’t, I’m not going to tell you. -But if you go. to

.the Stanley you’ll learn that Vanning took overall the.

city’s night spots and turned ‘them into what es-'e1'yone
concerned rather snobbishly called “cl1p_jo1nts."4

V Bette Davis, as is her custom, is playing the part of
what we shall euphoniously call a loose. woman. For-«
tunately for the plot, however, Bette is a little bit smart-
er" than the usual run of the mine loose woman. She

knows what side her butter is breaded on. Consequently.

Vanning’s _lawyer is able to tear apart in less

is not as smart as we originally thought, because shefs
been keeping her ikid sister in college. You see, Bette is
ashamed" of ‘ her balling and she doesn’t want her kid

French F ilms Portray redk      
  Old Theatre Tragditiorl

V Secrecy Shrouds‘
V Cap,-Gown Rehearsals

 

“Why are Cap and Gown rVel1e.arsals "

By Robert M. Brown

Last Thu1'sday’s‘ audience at the
showing of French ﬁlms of the early
20's found them dramatic, laughable.
and deﬁnitely foreshadowing the co-
lossal proportions to which the indus-
try has growVn with the aid of modern
makeup, scenery, and the expert
guidance of brainy pijoducers.

Following the candid camera sliots
of’ Lumiere brothers which made a
big hit with European royalty, the
audience-_ witnessed anearly French
classic, “The Runaway Horse,” that
directly inspired later p.ie~heaving'
shorts’ here in America. It was good
to see the ludicrous Parisians jerk
through the-“ streets, knocking over
apple stands, fat ladies, and religious
gatherings in the chase 01' a frighten-
ed horse. _ r V"

The act-iiig was quite bad, of course,
the characters always conscious of
the fact that a camelraman was in
l'_r«mi -‘-1' them ;_»fi'imli|1g:x\\':._\', but her->
:a;_-'-.:in, the Fr-ouch had euro’:-cil in ,,vu.~:h-
ing 1'01-warcl ﬁlm development.

But, in watcliing audience reaction
to the detective thriller, “Juve vs.
Fantomas,” one was conscious of the
fact that styles in movie subjects
change as fast as styles in women’s
clothes. Produced in 1913 by Louis
Feuillade, the Fantomas series were
tremendously popular in their day..as
depicting the triumph of justice and
rightover _the evil forces of crime.

But the sympathies’ of the people
over in the Frick auditorium were
with the criminal with the shiny hair
while they laughed heartily at the fat
detective and his assistant puﬁing at
innumerable cigarettes; climbing- up
chimney .drafts, putting on spiked
shirts, and patting each other on the
back while waiting for the “silent
executioner.” Feuillade was notable in
freeing the‘ cinema from the artiﬁci-
ality of I the French theatre and mak-
ing the action move along.

The last ﬁlm, “The Crazy Ray,”
.-might easily have been directed by H.
G. Wells, so startling and novel is its
plot and method of handling. Rene

Clair, the direc.to_r,- drawing heavily
from previous French novels, built up
a striking subjecton the’ theme of a

half-mad scientist,_who invented a ray E

that made human life stop and remain
dormant.

By his use of familiar scenes and
,c.\'tcri01's, his obvious delight in hu-
man interest situations, and his use
of psychological m_om’ents,-.Rene Clair
opened possibilities that have been
heavily capitalized by later producers.

good as dropped. That sounds like a

course. _ _ _ _
Then there’s Bill Daddioi to consid-
er. He hasn’t been able to _;report yet
because of a football injury, but ’he’s
another one of these state champio-'ns,
winning the same title as Souchak
did. With the new set of -clubs that
his Meadville admirers gave him,- he
should be ready to brassie out-some
plenty good scores. "

Eddie Gluck, another sophomore, ’ ’ '

and a ﬁne competitive player, who
hovers around par all the time should
round out Pitt’s greatest golfing team.
The season starts at Alcon1a7'="’on
April 21 when Pitt pars off with Du-3
quense. Carnegie Tech follows soon
after. When these two matches are
completed the Panthers will be ready
for Conference competition. And if
hunches mean championships.

The ‘attention of the Evening.

Session student body is called to
the new constitution of the Eve-
ning Stud_ents’ Association that
was presented and approved at
the'fESA open meeting, Monday,
April 5, in the Lounge of the
Cathedral.

We feel that certain changes
are of special interest, namely,
that students, to be qualiﬁed as
candidates for Evening Stu-
dents’ Association oﬁicers, now
do not have to ﬁle their entrance
requirements to be considered
“regularly enrolled” students.

In addition, the size of the
executive committee has been in-
creased from ten to 12-members
andthe requirements for holding
office raised from ten to 20
credits. -

All of these changes, we feel,
will increase the efficiency of
the Evening Students’ Associa-
tion, and will make it possible
formore students to take an ac-
tive part in Evening School af-
fairs.

We congratulate the present
ESA administration‘ for their
initiative in this direction.
