Carter Ai Town Meeting

Pitt News Staff Writer
ALIQUIPPA, Pa.—Wendy V

Babiak, the 15-year-old girl‘ who
asked President Jimmy Carter if she
could hug him if Rosalynn didn’t
mind, stole the show at the
Aliquippa town meeting Saturday.

“Do you think you will run for a_
second term of office?” ' asked
Babiak. “And also, I would like to
ask if possible, and if Rosalynn
wouldn’t mind, could» Ihave a big
hug?” '

After pausing a few seconds,
Carter -answered, V “Well, the
answer to one of those questions is
absolutely yes. And the answer to
the other is that I will have to ask
Rosa1ynn.”

‘Babiak walked,to the stage where
she hugged Carter and kissed him
on the cheek as the 900 people in the

Aliquippa High School Auditorium -

applauded wildly- After the unex-
pected embrace Carter implored the
audience, ‘ ‘I would like to ‘ask all of
you not to tell my wife about this
until I can ‘get home and explainé’
‘ ‘I love him. I’ve been waiting for
this for three years...He’s so sweet
and nice,” Babiak told reporters
after the meeting.
Although the crowd was mostly
friendly, other inquisitors were not
- as amiable as Babiak. -James
Hawkins"; an Orthodox Christian
from New Galilee Township, asked
the president a pointed question
about Israeli occupation of Pales-
tinian land. ’ . A

“Many of us have been very
concerned with the _treatment that
our brothers and sisters, the
Orthodox Christians in occupied
Palestine, have received for the last
30 years at the hands of the Zionist
invaders who have stolen the land
and evicted them from their
homeland,” said Hawkins. _

“We want to know why your

administration has not had the

courage to stand up to Menachim
Begin...by simply cutting off all
foreign aid to the Israelis until they
give back all territories stolen from

the Orthodox Christians and

others,” he said.
Carter responsded first with a bit
of sarcasm, then more directly

answered Hawk_in’s question. “I. 
-thank you foryour very objective‘

and ‘unbiased question,” said the
president, “I don’t think that in
addressing this particular problem
'.o‘,f-the Palestinians nor in4addres-
sing all the broader interests in the
Mideast, my administration or I
have been timid or cowardly.‘ '
“The Palestinian Jews, -Arabs
and Christians in my opinion should
have a maximum opportunity for a

chance to escape the military

occupation rule and to have their
own government, within which
they can manage their won
affairs...One of the "remarkable
‘results of Camp David is that
everything that I have just
described to you has been
accomplished there. ”

P lonning Proposal To Senate’ 1

By LEONARD ROMBERG _

Pitt News Stat! Writer

, .

Chancellor Posvar and other Pitt
officials, at the year's’ first
University Senate meeting Friday,
outlined a program of austerity and
caution’ in face of declining
population trends and the stagnat-
ion of government aid. ‘

Responding to information show-
ing Western Pennsylvania to be
losing economic strength, Posvar

"said the University... must be

‘ ‘conservative’ ’ but ‘ ‘optimistic’ ’
when planning Pitt’s growth in th
1980’s. , '

The administration announced its
hopes to have ready by the
beginning of fiscal year 1980 a
detailed plan for the next decade.

A series of plans for Pitt "and
many researched demographic
trends 1 compose the document,
“University Planning Policies for
the 1980’s,” which was presented
to school and department repres-
entatives in a display of graphs and
charts. ’ I

Posvar explained that current
trends would decrease Pitt’s
undergraduate population by 5,000
between.1979‘and 1989. He added

4 that Pitt’s goal was to restrict the

decline to 800 studentsor less.”

--‘— ’ 1.‘

Vice Chancellor Jack Freeman

,_ outlined the economic problems of

inﬂation and the lack of increased

government aid from- either Wash-

ington or Harrisburg. .
“Pennsylvania has the capacity

to do much more for higher 2

education, but it has not_ shown the

will to do so,” Freeman said.-
Freeman’s data showed a pop-

ulation decline of 18-year-old to

22-year-old people of 15.3 percent-

inthe United States, 24.3 percent in
Pennsylvania and 30.8~percent in
Western Pennsylvania. Mean-
while the population of people
between 22 and 50 would increase.
. Freeman said those facts would
require Pitt to increase sevices to
that age group, withmore external
studies programs.
Posvar said however ‘ ‘enrollment
can be controlled” and that Pitt
would seek a -“broader range of
students,” including more minority
and foreign students. Scholarship
’ and grant money is not supposed to
change much in thenext decade.
Unlike the period from 1965 to
1976, there will be little new
construction on campus in the next
12 years_ because of limited funds
and little need for more buildings.-

Ids Questions On Mideast, Steel Industry

Carter iiaided questions ranging trom the Mid-east to the local steel industry at
Saturday’: meeting. He later attended a political fundraiser for Democrat

‘Eugene Atkinson.

By The Associated Press

BEIRUT, Lebanon—The Palestine
Liberation’ Organization yesterday
described President Carter as
» “arrogant” for grouping the PLO
in with such other movements as
the Nazis_and the Ku Klux Klan.

The PLO-run WAFA news
agency said Carter, by making the
comparison was trying to “disas-
sociate himself from the Nazi
label.” '

In a town-meeting appearance
near Pittsburgh Saturday, Carter
was asked why the Yasser
Arafat-led PLO. was allowed to
maintain a small informational
office in Washington. The
president responded by saying
many organizations are distasteful

Rcpstatement As Arrogant

to many Americans but still have
the right to free speech as long as
they don’t“ pose a threat to the
nation’s security.

“There are a lot of organizations
in our country which are obnoxious
to some of us, what they stand for,
what they believe in,...” Carter
said. “There are many groups like

this that cause us concem-the Ku'

Klux Klan, the Communist Party,
the Nazis. It would be nice for us if
they would just go away.”
Referring speciﬁcally to that
rémark, WAFA said: “That's real
arrogance. Go away from where
and from whom? We are neither in
the United States not with the
United States, so what does Carter
mean? _ ‘
“He means we should go away
from our homeland, the homeland
of_our grandfathers and the Arab

nation...so that the United States,

can be pleased and Carter can
rest,,”:WAFA said. '

(Continued from page 1)

Dan Clanamiz, Hopewell Town-
ship, also asked a question related
to the Mideast, wondering how the
government could allow the Pales-
tinian Liberation Organization
(PLO) to open an office in

' Washington, D.C. , when it admits it

has “ killed hundreds of people.”

The crowd became completely
silent as they waited for the
president's response.

Carter answered, saying that the
PLO had a constitutional right to
maintain an ofﬁce in the United
States and present their views to the
American people. He said he hoped
the PLO would learn more from
Americans than we could learn from
them, and that we can handle the
PLO not by stamping’ them out but
by solving the ‘problems of the
Mideast.

‘ ‘There are many groups like this
that cause us concern. The Ku Klux
Klan, for instance, the Communist
Party, the Nazis. It would be nice for
us if they would just go away,” he
said. ‘ ‘But it is part of our system of
government to let them have a right
to speak.” _

Philip Mancini, Aliquippa, wan-
ted to know why the president had
announced he would veto Sen.
Daniel Moynihan’s tax tuition bill if
it werepassed by Congress. The bill
would allow parents of college
students to deduct $250 from their
income taxes for every dependent
they have who attends college.

Carter defended his statement on
two grounds. He said he believed it
was best that the federal govem-
ment interfere as little as possible
with the private school system in the
United States and that the tax
credits would beneﬁt high income
families the most. /

The big question on the minds of
many at, the question-and-answer
session in the heart of Penn-
sylvania’s steelmaking region were
about Carter’s stand on_ steel
imports and the J&L Lykes
Merger. ' f

, Outside the high school, steel
workers distributed pamphlets
demanding total wage and beneﬁt
security for all ste_elworkers,
‘regardless of their length of service,
until they ﬁnd new jobs.

Two steelworkers who were not
chosen to ask Carter a question
criticized the merger because they
believed it would result in more
steel mill closing in the area. ,

“We want job security guar-
antees, not »training and re-
habilitation aid and subsidies,”
said one steelworker dressed in a
ﬂannel shirt, blue jeans and work
shoes.

Although the two steelworkers
never questioned the president,
another in the crowd did ask Carter
about the approval of the merger
between J & L and Lykes.

“Why did Attorney General Bell
go against the recommendation of
the Justice Department and ap-

prove the merger of LTV and Lykes C

Company?” ' said William‘ R.
Petrelli, Hopewell. “This will cost
jobs in Aliquippa.’

“I don’t know,” replied the
president. He explained that the
decision had been made independ-
ently of the White House and
assured Petrelli that he was
attempting to rejuvenate the
American steel industry.

Carter managed to get a plug for I

gubernatorial candidate Pete Flah-
‘ erty while ﬁelding questions. When

' one inquisitor asked how citizens

could ﬁght corruption the president
responded, “You ' could elect
officials who have shown that they
are capable of avoiding instances of
corruption-'-Pete Flaherty would be
an example.”

Later, at a $100-a-plate dinner for
Eugene Atkinson, a congressional
candidate in the 25th district, the
president pronounced his support
for both Atkinson and Flaherty.

Carter, clad in a gray suit and
maroon tie, joined hands with
Flaherty and Atkinson in a show of
political unity and told theAtkinson
supporters at the dinner it was good
to be among friends again. “I need
a friend like Gene Atkinson in
Congress and a friend like Pete
Flaherty in the ‘state house,’ ’ Carter
said.

Politician, Teacher, Ice Cream Maker

Casey Juggles 2Jobs,

By the Associated Press

PHILADELPHIA-Wearing three
hats has proved a heavy load for
Robert ‘Casey, the Democratic
lieutenant gubernatorial candidate
who teaches high school biology
during the day and runs his ice
cream store on weekends.

Casey jumped into the political
spotlight unexpectedly after last

,May’s primary. The name .Robert

Casey, shared by the state’s former
auditor general, gave the ﬁrst-time
candidate a §t_ur_1ning upset victory.

 

  

Casey hadn’t campaigned much,
admitting the name was the game.
It was a new game in Philadelphia

:Friday, where Casey joined guber-
natorial candidate Peter Flaherty at

a fund-raiser to meet local
Democratic leaders and receive the
endorsement of Massachusetts
Sen. Edward Kennedy, one of the
party’s biggest names.

“There’s no way I can continue
this,” said Casey. “I’m damn near
exhausted.”

He explained that the previous
weekend he had attended a

ia, then worked on orders and pay
slips inhis suburban Pittsburgh ice
cream store. '

Monday, Casey taught at Alder-
dice High School in Pittsburgh,
(then ﬂew to Harrisburg to join
‘Flaherty in meeting Democratic
_state senators.

Tuesday and Wednesday it was
back to school during the day and
campaigning during the evenings.
On Thursday, he met with U.S.
Labor Secretary Ray Marshall in
rnsburg and o Erida he took

off for Philadelphia after

On Saturday, Casey was in
Aliquippa with Flaherty and
President Carter.

Casey was criticized when he
announced that he would returnto
teaching this fall instead of
campaigning full time. He said he
was returning to the classroom
because he needed the money, but
critics said it was because Flaherty
feared his unknown partner would
be a drag on the campaign.

unsuccessfully for admission in
1973 and 1974 to the campus 15

miles west of Sacramento.

The court also ruled on a

separate 5-4 vote that race could be
taken into account to maintain
diversity in admissions.

That portion of the ruling was
hailed by many civil-rights groups
as the preservation of affirmative
action programs. But legal experts
say it will take. more rulings" to
determine just what preferential
measures are permissible. ' -_

Bakke, described by his lawyer as
“a private man,” has shunned
publicity and refused interviews.

_,.

A group calling itself the National
Anti-Bakke Decision Coalition said

it would picket and hold a rally on ,

campus. Organizers of the
demonstration said they were
calling on the university to
“maintain and expand special
admissions. ’ ’

Little was known of the group and
no estimate was available "of the
number of persons expected to take
part in the demonstration.

Vicki Saito, a spokeswoman for
the medical school, -said that extra
security police would be present, as
usual during a demonstration, but
that Bakke had not asked ‘for special

knew, Bakke had received no
threats. '

‘The 101 students who this
morning entered their first class,

part, results of the Bakke decision.

Ms. Saito said minority students’

already admitted under the special
program were allowed to stay, but
students added to the class since the
Supreme Court ruling, replacing
those accepted who decided not to
come, have been screened by a new
method.

In line with the court ruling, the
committee considers a variety of
grounds for admission, including
race, income, grades test scores and
whether a student comes from a
medically needy area.

Ms. Saito said’ the committee
offered places -in ‘the class to

how many accepted. She said

LA. Busing Continues, WhiteAttendan,ce Rises

By The Associated Press

LOS ANGELES - White students
are attending Los Angeles public
schools in slightly higher numbers
since the start of an intergration
program this fall, but opponents of
court-ordered busing say white
attendance will fall far short of
school officials’ expectations.

The busing of 62,000 fourth-
through-eighth graders in the
nation's second-largest school dis-
trict began peacefully Sept. 12 as
part of an integration. plan that
emerged after court cases spanning
15 years.

At first-the buses carried only a
few white youngsters across the
711-square-mile school district,
from the predominately white San
Fernando Valley to inner-city
minority schools. Since then
attendance by white students has
increased daily, but the district's
own ﬁgures’ released last week
indicate‘ thousands are staying at
home or are illegally enrolled in
neighborhood schools.

About 4,100 white students were
being bused by court order to
predoninately minority “ex-

change” schools.‘ That ﬁgure is’

about half the number now
expected, but only a third of the
number the district had planned for
when it set up the integration
program. "In _contrast about 10,000
black and‘ Mexican-American stu-

- dents traveled to valley schools each
day last week.

Truant ofﬁcers have started
calling white parents to find out why
their children are no‘t’in school and
to urge them to abide by the law.

If parentsinsist on keeping their
children away and do not provide
them with a legal alternative»

such as private school or tutoring --
their cases could ‘be turned over to
the city attomey’s“ ofﬁce for
prosecution.

.“In general, the position of this
office will be to obtain ,voluntary
compliance,’_’ said city attorney_
Burt Pines. “But we are certainly
prepared to bring criminal prose-

cutions to enforce the compulsory _
‘education law.” 2-

‘‘I wish there were more Anglo
youngsters,” said schools superin-
tendent William J. Johnston. “But
if that’s the way it is.

-Committee BIocksDriIl   Biisales i'o'Sovieis'   

By the Associated Press

DALLAS—The deal isas complex
as the chunk of equipment at its_
heart—a tough, muiti-faced oil-drill
bit that Russia wants.

Dressers Industries, based in
Dallas, is eager to sell the Soviet

Union a plant to make the bits, and_- _
‘ being particularly tough and

President Carter has approved.

But other high ofﬁcials are
ﬁghting the deal. In Washington, a
Senate subcommittee on investiga-
tions has told Dresser to produce a
wide range of documents by today
so the matter can geta new review.

The stage is sent for two big
questions to be asked:

-'—Will this deal help the Russians at
the cost of American security?
—Even if it doesn’t, should the
United States use such trade deals

' as a lever to pressure the Russians
into such policies as better
treatment of dissidents?

In the larger scale of Dresser
Industries’ $3 billion annual sales
ﬁgures, the proposal to sell $145
million worth of the drill bits to 'the
Soviet Union over three years
doesn’t seem very big.

« But 'E.R. Lutex, senior \, vice
president of Dresser Industries,
who has assumed the role of

" company spokesman in the matter,
can recite from memory the events
that have brought it to the Senate
committee. ’

' Six years ago, he says, the
Russians approached Dresser about
building a plant to produce the rock
drill bits. A plant at Kuibyshev is

already manufacturing bits, but this
one would increase production
there by some 100,000 bits
annually.

Because of differences in drilling
technique, the Soviet bits rotate
much faster, and wear out faster.
Dresser’s bit has the advantage of

long-lasting. Last fall, the Com-
merce Department issued a favor-
ablereport, and -Dresser got two
‘ export licenses. Then the problems
' began.‘ .
Some of them focus on a
computerized electron-beam weld-
ing machine used in the manufac-
turing process. “It’s the. same
technique used in making television
picture tubes,” Luter says. “It’s
about as sophisticated as the control
mechanism on an automatic dish-
washer.”

‘ But others disagree, among them
Sen. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash.,
who says the technology can be
used to make armor-piercing shells.

Luter scoffs at that and says the ,

seal problem involves diplomacy.
Zbigniew_ Brzezinski, Carter’s
national ~ security adviser, and
Energy Secretary James Schlesin-
ger, who oppose the sale, want to
use trade with the Russians as a
diplomatic lever. Luter says the first
hint of trouble came from a
Brzesinski aide, Sam Huntington,
who wanted the deal withheld to
press for better treatment of Soviet

dissidents.

Eventually, even though Pres-
ident Carter had approved the
licenses, the Defense Department
obtained another review, an

   TheNeed
     for Substance
    in the Race

for Governor

Pete Flaherty was at his best during the fund-
raising. dinner for congressional candidate Eugene
Atkinson at Ciro’s restaurant in the Beaver Valley
Mall Saturday. Lambasting the Heinz family's
$95,000 contribution to Richard Thornburgh,
Flaherty cracked, “That’s a lot of pickles.”

Flahertyfs all-consuming concern with campaign
reform and the restriction of contributions any one
person can make is commendable. After hearing it
for what seems the 100th time, however, the former
Pittsburgh mayor’s clamor gets to be a bit tedious.
While he denounces extravagant campaign con-

tribution by bigwig Republicans, Flaherty seems to
forget there are other issues in the gubernatorial

campaign that he might address.

_ With the election only six weeks away, issues seem-
to be a forgotten element of the Flaherty-Thornburg
race, if one can dare call the gubernatorial campaign
since the primary elections a race. The only real topic
both Flaherty and Thornburgh have mentioned is tax
reform. Both have proposed rather nebulous
schemes for controlling rising taxes, but even the
discussion on those plans degenerated into an insult-

I trading match between the two candidates.

One topic both Thornburgh and ~Flaherty could
discuss is" their plan for funding repairs to the
thousands of miles of Pennsylvania roads that slowly
are disintegrating into gravelpaths. Any man who

can propose a feasible method to correct the

deterioration of our state’s roads probably deserves
to be elected governor on the merits of such a feat

if they knew how the two candidates plan to treat Pitt

and other state universities if they are elected.

Proposals illustrating the Republican . and
Democratic ideason economic revitalization in Pen-
nsylvania and especially in the steel industry might be
especially enlightening and help voters decide which
lever they should pull in November. Both workers
and businessmen would appreciate any sound
suggestions on methods to stem ,the outﬂow of in-
dustry from the state.

The easiest way Thornburgh and Flaherty can
present their stands on issues to Pennsylvania voters
is through open debate between the candidates.

It is encouraging to know the candidates have
scheduled a series of debates to be televised in the

nextfew weeks. We can only hope they discuss the

issues we have mentioned and the numerous other we

have not. Any debates in which the candidates fail to _
touch on all the problems facing Pennsylvania would

cheat the electorate of any chance to make a fully in-
formed decision Nov. 7. : '

Med School Value-Decisions

Your analysis.‘ of Dr. Werner’s
resignation as dean of the medical
school (‘ ‘Werner’s Resignation and
"Legislative Priorities,” Sept. 13,
1978) was more befuddling than
enlightening. A -

\

Pitt followed a demoralization; it

didn’t'cause one. ‘And given‘ the 
administra- V

policies of Werner’s
tion, it was so predictable that it
almost "seems sought after.

Dr. Werner, a brilliant scientist

and researcher, led the med school -

through an age of government
intervention and trendy consumer-
ism with a brand of politicking that
relied on a wide gap between

promise and product. The promise ‘

was primary care, community
involvement and social commit-
ment. The product was research
and tertiary care. I

In our time, even the hard
sciences have been shown vulner-
able to overriding moral concerns.
Truth and knowledge, the main-
stays of value-free science, have
never been a less satisfactory
benchmarlr of excellence. Excel-
lence is a matter of setting goals and

striving to attain them honestly. ~

The goals of a medical school must

Using government as a scapegoat '
‘for our fall from excellence ignores 
the‘, controversy over what consti- :-
tutes excellence in a medical ‘school..,;\.
The governmental coldshoulder to s

be research, patient,-care, and

education, in varying proportions.
In the last few years, this medical

school made value decisions which

. clearly stress research over the
; other two priorities. These include '

the construction of a DNA

~ recombination laboratory (while an .‘
' audio-visual center for students is

delayed indefinitely) and the
expansion" of --the Radiology »
department (while there is still no
Family Practice Department at all.)
I can only" interpret Werner’s

resignation as recognition of the

fact that such values are no longer
supportable at Pitt.

The government is not the only
organization that is questioning the
nature of the responsibility a health
center has to the community it
serves. ‘The/present system is
unacceptable to many. A power
shift is in the ofﬁng, from the
patriarchal autocracy of scientists
and health professionals, to a more
honest and democratic social
responsibility.

This is just the opposite of a shift
from excellence to mediocrity. We
have some rebuilding to do, but

value-decisions must precede blue-

prints.

“The executive’s tax burden is so

great today that achieving a degree of »

wealth commensurate with one’s ea‘r-
ning power...is a matter of urgent and
major importance. ”

—Research Institute of America Inc.

This introduced a special offer
that arrived via junk mail the other
day. The Research‘ Institute of
America Inc. offered weekly
reports, at $36 a year, that promised
to open up loopholes in executive
tax laws. .

RIA, a corporation with an
academic-sounding name, sent this
offer to American Express card-
holders. Evidently, chances of
ﬁnding the tax-burdened wealthy
were greatest in this cross section of
the population.

Upon closer examination, RIA
promised tips on the following:
—How to handle a tax audit
rewardingly.

-—-The tax-wise divorce.

——Paying wages to your youngsters
for a triple tax break.

—How to shift wages to low-bracket
relatives, simply, with- no formal-
ities. ‘ 7 _

—How to nail down deductions for
gambling losses. ' I
—-How to deduct for investment
research, even if you don’t invest.
—Earning 100 percent deductions
for business-pleasure trips.

What makes these offers dis-
turbing instead of annoying is the
promise of wealth instead of tax
savings. And this right-to-wealth
dogma represents the sentiment
found in the American business
community today.

‘ themselves members of the middle

class. And this offer plays on their

dreams of becoming one of those-

millionaires who becomenotorious
by not paying a penny in taxes.

These middle-level executives
only come close to their dreams by
imitating upper-level executives.
Many use the corporate leaders of
10 to 15 years ago as their role
models. And this leads to the
corporate bungling synonymous
with the American capitalistic
system.

They lead corporate divisions that
frown upon professionals who don’t
wear white shirts or who have
mustaches or hair over their ears.
These divisions usually lack women
and minority professionals. The
amb'tio‘us middle-level executive is
the vanguard of corporate conser-
vatism.

Corporate conservatism is more
than rules governing employee
appearance and conduct. It main-
tains the status quo in business
practice and long-range planning.

Our corporations today are
weighted down by middle-level
executives, whose ambition pre-
vents them from straying from a
conservative image in order to
succeed. _

These executives prefer to show a
5 percent growth rate from year to
year. They reject capital expansion
that would show 300 percent growth
over 10 years, because it would
require showing a loss over the first

‘two or three.

Neglect of spending for capital
expansion withholds funds from
national and local economies. This
promotes both recession and
unemployment. =

Of course, not'all middle-lev
executives behave this way. A few

capitalism as they sit back and

the latest questionable tax loop-
holes.

Since the latest subscription offer
for the tax-advice publication was
sent to American Express card-
holders, this calls for a new series of

company. Forget Pele, Bob and

The new commercials will open

.' By MARTHA GARVEY
Pm News Staff Writer

“Girlfriends” needs a new title.
Susan Weinblatt (Melanie. Mayron) and Anne Munroe (Anita
Anne is an aspiring
‘writer, Susan is a photographer who supports herself by taking
‘pictures of Bar Mitzvahs andweddings. “Girlfriends” has an ironic
ring to it: Susan and Anne are young, but they’re.full-fledged
grown-ups. Still, what do you call two women who care about each

other? '
When Anne leaves to get married, Susan feels jealous and
betrayed. ‘Anne’s and Susan’s friendship is mostly described
through its absence. Susan is an uneasy intruder in Anne’s new

1 house. Susan considers an affair with a charming married rabbi (Eli

Wallach), but like Anne, he has a separate life. Susan-remains
infuriatingly tentative with Eric (Christopher Guest), the only

  one-night stand who ever called back, because, she explains, “I’m

afraid of getting left.”
Anne has a baby. Susan brazens her way into her ﬁrst exhibit.

Anne discovers she’s pregnant again". Anne and Susan break-

up-—their friendship has become a series of unreturned phone calls.
.On -the opening night of Susan’s exhibit, Anne has an abortion.
Susan and Anne get drunk, becoming “girlfriends” once more.

* . Anne’s husband returns. The ﬁlm ends with the two women's faces,

caught between what they'had and what they‘ are:
But the title is wrong. ‘It is Melanie Mayron’s movie, from her
little pink glasses and ex-fat kid clothes to her slouch-shouldered

-  walk and her fair ready for take-off. It is Susan’sresponse to the loss
of her ~ friend and Susan’s growth that shape the movie.

Anne’s life is seen in semaphore: a moment with her husband,

' Martin (Bob Balaban), a moment with her baby, a moment with
Susan. When Anne accuses Susan of having more fun, of being,

singleand free, there's nothing in the film that's told us much
different. ‘ - . _ I .
Still, “Girlfriends” is as comfortable, practical and real as an old

' quilt. Susan is the girl in high school who would have had such a

pretty face, if only she would take off her glasses. And fix her hair.

A And buy a completely new wardrobe. And jog four times a week.

Anne’s marriage isn't horrific—Just uninteresting and not much

I fun. -

And there are no Snidely Whiplash men in “Girlfriends,” no

one-dimensional husbands or one-night stand duds. All the men are ‘

nifty. Eli Wallach is outstandng as the married rabbi who dreamed
of becoming an actor. When Mayron and Wallach are on screen
together, their energy is radioactive. The attraction between them
is not so much sexual as creative; they are two imaginations
magnetized together. '

Guest's Eric is an endearing twist on a one-night stand standard.
When Susan leaves him in the middle of the night (“ ‘Is it something I
did?” he asks plaintively), he calls her back two months later. He
also makes peace with Susan by bringing her a fuzzy baby duck.
“I thought we might have an early dinner...or a young dinner,” he
apologizes. But he is also grumpy and messy. The ﬁlm is populated
with an unusually high percentage of real people.

,Mayron's Performance Highlights "Girlfriends"

By BILL MOORHEAD V
While Pitt fans joybusly cele-
brated Temple’s defeat at the
hands of the Panthers, a smaller,
though equally joyous tribute to the
, life and works of Anais Nin took
place in Benedum Auditorium this
Saturday. ‘

“Presented by Pittsburgh Film-
Makers and the" English and Fine
Arts Departments of Pitt, the
program . opened with two _ short
ﬁlms Nin participated in, “Apertu-

_ra” and “Through the Magi-
scope,” both directed by her
husbandIan.Hugo. Frank Alberti,
a poet and acquaintence of Nin,
then spoke of the time he met Nin
and how she tried to help him get a
start, finding him jobs and
introducing him to her wide circle
of friends, including the likes of
Henry Miller, Dr.- Otto Rank,
Lawrence Durell and Caresse
Crosby. Although he met Nin only
a year before she died in January,
1977, Alberti was so profoundly
inﬂuenced by her that he was

- moved to write a book, “A Summer

with Anais,” about her last
summer,‘ 1976. - ‘

Richard Centing, creator and
editor .of “Under the Sign of
Pisces,” a journal dedicated to
works of Nin, spoke next. Talking
softly yet emotionally of his 10 year
friendship with Nin, Centing
honored the audience with a slide
display of Nin, the first time he had
ever shown it publicly. While.
admitting the pictures were of an
amateur quality, even the occa-
sional poor lighting couldn’t
conceal the intense natural beauty
of Nin’s smile.

Besides her fiction Nin is
probably best known for her
diaries, a monumental body . of
work that Centing estimated would
cover a good ﬁfty volumes should
the entirety be transcribed into
print. On the subject of her diaries,
of which ﬁve volumes have been
published,'Nin once wrote: “This

Good Release From
Brothers Johnson

By PHILIP SCALAMOGNA/' .

Pitt News Staff Writer “

Blaml !
Brothers Johnson

With their latest work,
“Blamll”, the Brothers Johnson
add a-new dimension to soul music.
Led by George and Louis Johnson,
the band includes six additional
members, and several other
musicians help out on “Blaml!”
The album is produced by the
renowned Quincy Jones, who also
co-wrote ‘most of the songs.

A moving, hard-to-resist beat
begins “Ain’t We Funkin, Now.”
Louis Johnson’s lively bass adds
power and gives a funky ﬂavor.
The horn work is discreet,'accent-
uating but not overpowering,
contributing a certain crispness to
the songs throughout the album.

On the mellower side, “So Won't

You Stay” exhibits ﬁne vocals in a "

beautiful ballad. Michael Breck-
er’s sax .solo really grabs the

much the same style of “Ain’t We

On the second side, the
harmonies-on “Ride 0 Rocket”
blend well, while Richard Tee's
pﬂuid keyboard work gives added
spice to the total sound. “It’s You
Girl”follows as the most melodic

piece on the album, with a relevant
message. ’

selection, “Street-
is undoubtedly the ﬁnest
and most ambitious work on
“Blaml!” Actually it’s a ﬁve-min-
ute instrumental with an enticing
beat and rich, lively horn work.
Lawrence Williams’ synthesizer
adds sharpness while Kim Hutch-
croft’s soprano sax lingers lazily
through.

The only drawback on “Blaml ! ”
is that sometimes, in songs like
“Ain’t We Funkin" Now” or
“Mista Cool,” the band falls into
rhythmic and vocal monotony.
Still, songs like “Streetwave” and
“Ride 0 Rocket” remind the
listener of the band's potential. ~
“Blam!!”not only reveals how far
the‘ Brothers "Johnson have come
but also ,how far they could go. . '

Nothing Woncleerful About

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Waverly Wonders
Fridays, 8 p.m.
NBC

As an AFC quarterback, Joe Namath’s football
career was done in by fragile knees in 12 seasons; as a
television actor on NBC’s “The Waverly Wonders,”
what’s threatening Namath’s future is the scripts.
The one-liners from _“Waverly” are so antiquated
they make Gabe Kaplan’s Henny Youngman routines
from “Welcome Back Kotter” seem fresh, not to
mention funny. .

 .‘ ‘Waverly’ ’ bears more than a passing resemblance

to “Kotter.” Namath playsgJoe Casey, a washed-up
reject from the NBA who takes an offer to coach at

,. Waverly High School for a squad that rtesembles the

sweathogs in gym shorts. The team includes Joshua

Grenrock (who does 'a Robert Hegyes imitation), ,

Charles Bloom(who thinks he’s Ron Howard(, and
shrill-voiced Kim Lankford (wliocopies Namath).
- The problem with Na-math’s performance is that for

the most part he stands ‘around either looking’

semi-stunned, as if he’s just been ‘sacked by a
linebacker, or rolling his eyes, as if he can’_t: believe
the script. 1 - I ' Q  » 1-’,

In the show’s debut episode, “Waverly” featured a
conﬂict between a nervous son (Bloom) and his
aggressive father (the inestimable Conrad Bain, late
of “Maude”) who criticizes the boy in front of his
teammates when he blowsia basketball game. To get

 back at his dad, Bloom runs away to the coach’s place,

‘where Namath is preparing to spend a big evening
‘with an attractive date.

Of course, one by one, the entire starting line-up
files in. Bloom confronts Bain with a paper bag over
his head (to control his hyperventilation--another vain
attempt at a cheap sight gag).

”Wc1ver|Y" Nc1mo’rh'sTV Showi

Possibly, the scripts will get better; most probably
they won’t. And all that leaves on the plus side for

I‘ “Waverly” is Namath, who, despite the vapid lines,

has a genuinely pleasant and easy-going presence on
screen. If, and it’s a big if, Namath can cut out those
slapstick gestures, he might even be able to transcend
the cloying cuteness that passes for wit on
“Waverly,’ ’ at least until new writers can be brought
in. Sex appeal has propped up the ratings of other
shows, most notably “Charlie’s Angels,” and
Namath’s may yet save “Waverly.” I

If “Waverly” gets better writers, Namath could
prove to be better on the tube on the gridiron or on
Broadway. As it is, though, it will belittle wonder if
“Waverly” is cancelled before the midseason break.

 

Joe Namath may find the television ratings war tougher
than any defensive line he faced ln.hls dozen years as an
NFLquarterback. Namath plays a basketball coach in
f‘The Waverly Wonders."

.      Believeoble Film I

 

It is immensely difficult to capture _the fabric of friendship on film.
The film—perh aps properly—-focuses ‘on - the anger and the
confusion that follow when the relationship is lost. But we lose even;
more of Anne because Susan’s art is so tangible and visual and Anne
is not‘. ‘ ‘Girlfriends’ ’ is full of Susan’s work, and the ‘subjects of her -
work. ‘ '

Anne reads one rather wimpy-sounding poem to Susan while "
she is in the bathroom. She sighs heavily over her typewriter. Anne
always remains blurry, like her writing. Susan is her photography-—

‘clear and original, but far from perfect. ‘

‘ ‘Gir1friends” is, good at catching the small, affecting moments.
Anne leans over her baby’s crib to tell her child a secret, a secret
they’re not going to tell Daddy—she’s pregnant‘ again.
Susan’s exhibit is a success—but the gallery owner has forgotten to »~.
put up her best picture. Susan’s rabbi quietly disappears from the »
exhibit when he sees he’s been replaced by Eric, accompanied by
the fuzzy duck. ‘

“Girlfriends” is still at least a couple of light years ahead of any
other film that tries to describe women’s friendships.
It is, in one way, atraditional ﬁlm about the coming of age of a young
artist. But unlike some glossy products I've seen lately about
women and about Art, “Girlfriends” is a cinematic quilt, made to
last. I

Pitt Booters Drop Chaotic Contest with Slippery Rock 7 *~

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Stat! writer _

Pitt’s soccer team dropped its
record to 1-2 Saturday, losing a very
physical, chaotic game in the ﬁnal
moments to Slippery Rock.

With two minutes remaining and
the game tied 1-1, Slippery Rock's
Jeff Buirge caught the Panthers off

guard and scored the deciding goal.-_

One of the teams playing football
Saturday at Pitt Stadium was the
ninth-ranked club in the nation,
and the fan (or coach) who names it‘
ﬁrst could win a prize package
worth close to a million dollars and
a free trip south on New Years’
Day. Which team was it?

Was it Pitt (it wore blue and
gold),now 2-0 after its 20-12 win? It
was losing at the half, 6-3, could
muster just 125 ﬁrst-half yards,
had drived choked off by penalties
and mistakes and realized that it
could not get the ball to the best
receiver in the country.

Or was it the loser, Temple (in
the white with red helmets)? It
gained only four less total yards
than Pitt, though its punter was at
times the team's most potent
offensive weapon, and it was ahead
into the third quarter despite
having one ﬁrst down in the

,opening‘ period and not crossing

the 50-yard line until late in the
half. '
Jackie Sherrill was not happy.
“I told them (to be wary of
Temple) before the game,” a terse
Sherrillsaid. “At halftime I told
them I’d see what they‘ were made
of. It was a great character test.”
Rick Trocano passed that test
easily. The much-maligned soph-
omore had a poor ﬁrst half and was
booed by some of the 43,445
spectators. He even was replaced
by an already-injured Lindsay
Delaney. But in the thrid quarter,
Trocano ran the option so well it
would have made Barry Switzer

‘ weep. ‘Trocano carried the ball 14

‘times for 84 yards and one
touchdown.

“We just weren’t moving the
ball,” Sherrill said concerning
Trocano’s removal. “We asked
Lindsay if he could play, and he
said he could. ’

“Maybe in the ﬁrst half Rick was '

thinking of pitching too much,”
“We knew the

 

Buirge took a corner kick that had
cleared the goal and redirected it
into thenet for the finish.

The ﬁrst goal of the game was
scored 30 minutes into-the first half
just after Slippery Rock freshman
Eduardo Molina gained control ‘of
the ball. The ball had been
mishandled and bounced around
from player to player until Molina

ers   Overcome Owls, 20-1 2 

quarterback would be the key. Rick
made a great play with the
touchdown. He read the defense
well and took it in. Rooster Jones
made a great block.”

The Rooster didn’t. start the

game so well. After Temple took 2

the opening kickoff, gained exactly
minus one yard and punted, Pitt
looked as if it would move right in
for the score. The romp was on.

Trocano hit Gordon Jones for 16
yards and a ﬁrst down, then Larry
Sims’ 25-yard scamper moved the
ball to the Temple 13. Two plays
later, though, Rooster fumbled and
Brett Hardenstine recovered at the‘
10 for Temple. Cock-a-doodle-do.

, A Temple turnover gave Pitt its
ﬁrst score. Mark McCants fumbled
Joe Gasparovic’s punt, and Wal-
lace Thomas fell on it for the
Panthers at the 19. Followingtwo
incomplete passes and a 15-yard
holding call, Trocano scrambled for
19 yards back into ﬁeld-goal range.
Mark Schubert booted the 36-yard-
er, and, with 2:33 left in the ﬁrst
quarter. Pitt led, 3-0.

After most of the second quarter.
was spent exchanging punts,=_
Temple took the lead just before
halftime. Robert Keels intercepted
a Delaney pass that popped out of
the hands of Rooster Jones at the

. visitor’ s 48. Anthony Anderson, the

,Owls’ leading rusher with 1 11 yards
‘on 20 carries, did most of the work

"from there, scooting nine, 16 and,

ﬁnally, 13 yards for the go-ahead
score with just 37 seconds left. The
PAT failed, and it was 6-3 at the
half.

Pitt cameito play in the second

half. The ‘line blew the Owls‘ out

himself into undisputed possession

ing the football.

little more than four minutes.

Assistant coach Richard Blackett
said Pitt’s problem was caused by a
general breakdown.

“I thought we should of won the
game,” said Blackett. “The team
has just been too tight out there on
the ﬁeld. “Our players are being
built up, but then they breakdown;
we’re just not finishing. Once we

get that together, we should start
winning games.” —

Steelers Stun Browns with Bradshaw's 100th Touchdown

Terry Bradshaw's 100th career
touchdown pass -- a 37-yarder to
ti t end Benny Cunningham on a
razzel-dazzel play -- gave the
Pittsburgh Steelers a 15-9 sudden-
death victory over the Cleveland
Browns yesterday in a National
Football League game.

The victory boosted the Steelers
ahead of Cleveland into sole
possession of ﬁlrst place in the
American Conference Central Divi-
sion. Both teams had been 3-0.

The Steelers faced second down
and nine at the Cleveland 37 on the
ﬁlrst sudden-death series when
Bradshaw handed off to running
back Rocky Bleir, who handed off to
wide“ receiver Lynn Swann, who
pitched the ball back to Bradshaw.

Bradshaw then lofted a pass to
Cunningham, who made the grab
three yards from the goal line and

»T5'<.‘.'i"’ "

stepped into the end zone ahead of
pursuing Brown‘ defensive back
Thom Darden.

The winning score came with 3:43
gone in overtime. A

Cleveland's Don Cockroft and
Pittsburgh's Roy Gerela each
kicked three field goals. _in
regulation play, which ended at 9-9.

On the last regulation play,

- Cleveland quarterback Brian Sipe

threw a pass of more than 50 yards
into the Pittsburgh end zone. It was
intercepted by safety Tony Dungy_
and returned to the Cleveland
35-yard line as time expired.

The Steelers had gained their 9-9
tie wilth 2:35 left in the fourth
quarter on a 36-yard ﬁeld goal by
Gerela, setup by a 23-yard pass
from Bradshaw to John Stalworth.

After winning the sudden-death
coin ﬂip, the Steelers drove from
their ’21' to the Cleveland 27,

converting a fourth-down-and-one
play at midﬁeld on a—rush by Franco
Harris. '
Bradshaw's bomb came two plays
later. -
Sipehad his first pass of the game

intercepted by Steeler safety Don 4

Shell at the Brown’s 36-yard line,
setting up a 19-yard field goal by
Gerela.

The Browns countered with ﬁeld
goals of 43 and 30 yards by Cockroft
in the final seven minutes of the
second quarter.

Cockroft' s second boot came after .

Steeler rookie Larry ‘Anderson
fumbled a‘ kickoff return and
Cleveland’s Ron Bolton returned it
13 yards to the Pittsburgh
14-yardline. '

After leading, 6-3, at halftime,
the Browns ran it to 9-3 in the third
quarter on a 41-yard ﬁeld goal by

ll        Commander Always Uses   

When Pitt’s Jeff Delaney intercepted 'a Temple
pass in the end zone, the scoreboard proclaimed what ’
43,445 fans and head coach Jackie Sherrill had to be

— feeling at the _time: whew!

The Panthers defeated the Owls, 20-12, Saturday
afternoon in a game that, pardon the cliche, was
closer than the score indicated. Temple came to Pit-

tsburgh with the intention of proving that last year’s

rout in Philadelphia was a fluke, and it is doubtful

, that the Panthers would have been able to rack up 76

points if the teams had played another four quarter.
It may be negativism that impels one to find fault

with a victory, but if the Panthers are to live up to

preseason expectations, they will_have_to beat teams
far superior to the Temples and the Tulanes.

The defense was adequate: 12 points allowed is a
decent day's work for any unit. If Pitt hopes to stay
in the game next week against North Carolina,
however, the offense will have to show up for the fir-

. st half as well as the second.

In the first half, Pittfs offense resembled a stick of

dynamite without‘ the nitroglycerin; the ingredients “"
"were there but the catalyst was missing.

Oc-
casionally, the Panthers would string together a suc-
cessful series or two, but just when it appeared the
bomb was ready to detonate, a penalty or a turnover
put out the burning fuse. .

Temple entered the game looking to keep the ball
away. from Gordon Jones and cut off the Panthers?

First and Goal

By BOB LABRIOLA

inside running game.; The strategy worked well;
Jones ended up with only 28 yards on two catches,
and Rick Trocano ended up with the same number of
rushing attempts (23) as the starting running backs.
Pitt’s passing game (it will be referred to as such
even though it closely resembled" Exedrin headache
No. 248) consisted of Trocano or Lindsay Delaney
trying to force the ball to Jones. Sherrill he said that
he would like to get thetball to Jones ‘‘II or 12 times
a game,” and his quarterbacks are doing their dar-
ndest to accomodate him. , ’
While the passes often were thrown to Jones
(always in the company of at "least two defenders),
flanker Ralph Still and Rooster Jones spent much of

T the afternoon in the secondary with nary a defender

or the football within shoutingdistance.

When. Temple stacked . the V middle against Pitt’s
running game, the Panthers adjusted and took ad-
vantage of what the Owls gave them (the quarterback
keeper on the option series).

Pitt’s only touchdowns came in the third period,
when Trocano carried the ball 13 times for 84 yards
and a score. The Panthers attempted only one
pass—that to Jones on the only passing situation
(third and eight) Pitt faced. -L ‘

.. What the Panthers did in the third quarter with
their running game is exactly what has to be done to

 shorexup the passing attack—take what the defense

gives you. .

Completing passes to Still, Clifford Moore andthe
running backs either will free Jones or give the Pan-
thers easy touchdowns. A touchdown catch by a
receiver other than Jones may be less acrobatic, but
at this stage Pitt needs points, not esthetics.

Sherrill talks about “getting the ball to our skilled
people,” and it seems since Jones is the most skilled,

the passes always come his way. Jones is indeed a .

quality receiver, possibly the finest in the country,
but the odds of completing a pass to a wide-open‘
receiver are better than to one who is double covered.
During the Panthers’ drive to the national cham-
pionship in 1976, the game with Duke in Durham,
N.C. was pivotal. The Blue Devils stacked their

defense to stop Tony Dorsett, which they did as well .

as anyone that year, only to have Matt Cavanaugh
pass ,for 339 yards.

Using all its weapons is how Pitt won 23 games the
last two plus seasons; to abandon that strategy now
would be disasterous.

Trocano ran the option left and
right, usually keeping the ball
himself. The sophomore had gains
ofthree, 11, 11, 12 and 16’yards on

the drive," the latter being the A
touchdowntplay that put Pitt into

the lead to stay.
An aroused defense gave Temple

‘nothing onlfts next possession, and

Temple punter Casey Murphy

‘could manage only a 13-yard punt.‘

With excellent ﬁeld position at the
Temple 48, Trocano ran for eight

' yards and a play later hit Gordon
_ Jones for 12 more.

But the drive seemed to_ stall,
and, on fourth and one from the 25,
Schubert came onto the ﬁeld to
attempt a ﬁeld goal". Maybe
Temple should have noticed that no
holder came out with him. Shortly
after putting the tee on the ﬁeld,
Schubert picked it up and put it in
his pants. He then lined up at tight
end, and Trocano carried for two

' yards and a ﬁrst down.

On the next play, Fast Freddie
Jacobs ran 23 yards for the
game-winning score, and suddenly
the fans began to recognize the Pitt
team they _ had come to see.
Schubert, this time with a holder
and the tee on the ground, kicked

‘the extra point, and Pitt led, 17-6.

The Panthers scored on their

third consecutive possession early "

in the ﬁnal period. JoJo Heath

Jacobs runs moved Pitt to the 9. '
-An illegal receiver downfield
penalty on the next play cost Pitt a
shot at another touchdown and sent
the offense back to the 25. Larry
Sims’ halfback option pass was
dropped in the endzone by Ralph
Still,‘ and the Panthers settled for
Dave Trout’s 41-yard ﬁeld goal.
Temple’s ﬁnal touchdowns came
with a little more than ﬁve munutes

Broomell to Steve Watson, but
Broomell’s two-point conversion
