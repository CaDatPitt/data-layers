Athletic Director Tom Hamilton emphatically squashed
rumors today that Dr. H. C. Carlson has been asked to resign

as basketball»coach,_a job the jovial MD has held for the last

30 years. is
S In reference to a story which came out of New York City

' that the athletic department was planning to replace Dr.

Carlson with a younger man, Capt. Hamilton asserted that
“there isinothing to the rumor.”

The athletic director deplored the tendency on the part
of some people to give creden-ce to such an irresponsible story
by printing it.

“We have the utmost appreciation of Dr. Carlson as a
man and a coach,” Capt. Hamilton said, “and we are very
appreciative of this service to the University.”

Reporter Called Source ‘Reliable’

The story reached Pittsburgh in a column by Pittsburgh
Sun-Telegraph reporter Jack Henry. Henry, who was once
‘a member of Pitt’s journalism department, described his
source as “reliable.” ‘

ilton “had in mind” bringing in a new basketball coach not
long ‘after he became athletic director.

The source of the story added that Capt. Hamilton put
off making the change, because he became “involved” in fre-
quent football coaching personnel changes.

Is ‘Hobby’ a Factor?

_ Henry’s column indicated that since coaching basketball
is a “hobby with Carlson, that may be a factor in future de-
velopments.” ’ ' »

Dr. Carlson has coached Pitt basketball practically gratis,
according to the athletic department.

The curly—haired mentor,- long a colorful ﬁgure in Amer-
ican basketball; became more controversial than usual a few
weeks ago, when his team lost to Penn State after an ex-
tended “freeze” of the ball.

According to Dr. Carlson himself, the New York story
has no basis in fact. “Nobody has suggested that I quit,” he
said. ‘

Asked if, after a 30-year coaching career, he was planning
to voluntarily retire, Dr. Carlson replied “eventually,” and

Henry quoted hisinformant as saying that Capt. Ham-

Dr. Maurice Thomas, Pitt pro-
fessor of education who...sc_heduled
the talk, lashed back at critics of
the Columbia speaker.

Dr. Thomas said, “The attempt
of the various pressure groups to
muzzle Counts is contrary to the
whole thesis of American demo-
cracy, the right to express all
viewpoints.”

Counts Not Subversive

“Dr. Counts,” the Pitt educator
asserted, “has no subversive incli-
nations.”

Dr. Counts has traveled in the
Soviet Union and is considered an
authority on Russian affairs. He-

has written numerous books on‘,

Russia, and has a national reputa-
tion in educational circles.

Vice-chancellor Charles B. Nut-
ting said that “it is well known
that Dr. Counts reﬂects an anti-
Soviet viewpoint.” Mr. Nutting
indicated that there had been no
plans for cancellation on the part
of the administration.

Mr. Garman, who along with a
Pittsburgh group called the Minute
Women made the original charges,
said he planned another letter to
Pitt ofﬁcials proposing a meeting
with a member of the House un-
American committee and an in-
vestigator from that group to de-
cide “who is telling the truth.”

In a telephone conversation with
The News, Garman objected in
particular to a book by a Russian

.,author called I Want To Be Like

Stalin, which Dr. Counts had
translated into English.
Book Lies? .

The book, said Mr. Garman, was
“ﬁlled with lies, it .is 1. . . one of
the best pieces of free propaganda
Russia ever received.” ’

Mr. Garman complained that
Counts, in his introduction, “failed
to warn” the reader of the “untrue
nature” of the book's content.

Meanwhile the chairman of the
American Legion’s “committee on
Americanism,” Col. Shenkel, re-
ported that his group had not “reg-
istered any objections” to the talk.

In the talk itself, Dr. Counts
violently attacked what he called
the “utter ruthlessness” of the

Mid-Semester
Grade Reports

Freshmen will soon be able to
ﬁnd out how they are coming
along academically under a new
program launched by the Uni-
versity this semester.

The program calls for mid-
semester grade reports, according
to E. A. Batchelder, assistant reg-
istrar.

Reports will also be given to
transfer students and students on
probation. .

On Mar. 24 blue class cards will
be sent to departments for distri-
bution to individual instructors.
The instructors are to give a one
hour quiz before Mar. 29 to de-
termine the progress of the stu-
dents.

The cards will then be sent to

grades will be sent to the offices

of the respective deans.‘

committee to the by-laws commit-
tee and then postponed action.

_ Must Act Fast
If the sub-committee intends

to have any revisions ready for

vote at SC elections in April,
prompt action will have to be tak-
en because by—law changes must
be published one month before
election, according to the consti-
tution.

Members of the sub-committee
say the result of the planned
changes will probably be a broad-
er representation of the student
body.

Students Vote Also

This means that student groups,
having no representation on SC,
may have a voice after the by-
laws have been amended and ap-
proved by congress and the stu-
dent body.

If a majority of congress favors
the amendments, they will be pre-
sented to the student body for
consideration at SC election time
late in April. In_ order for the
amendments to become law, two-
thirds of all the votes cast must
favor the proposed additions.

naturally!

“‘Jo,”‘ an ex-Pitt Player and ’48
graduate, and now secretary in the
speech department, has played
more mother and grandmother
roles than she cares to remember.
She mothered the heroes and he-
roines of Joan of Lorraine, All My

rence role in Glass Menagerie, on
the.Foster stage.‘

However, she did manage to

Player’s Gold in the Hills. She is
remembered for her sensational
take-off on Mae West’s “Diamond
Lil.” '

And now in addition to her sec-
retarial duties and playing advi-

been delegated another responsi-

who was called to a government
job in Yugoslavia in February.

It is her job to make-up and
dress the casts for the forthcom-
ing shows, You Touched Me, and
Our Town. And in her estimation
the difficulties in costuming the
You Touched Me cast are stupend-
ous.

She has been trying to obtain an
authentic Canadian Air Force uni-
form for the young lover in the
show. She has even contacted
friends who have Canadian rela-
tives or acquaintances.

Jo is quite hopeful that when
the curtain rises opening night,
Herb Carson will be sporting the

At present the costume crew is
also in the midst of a_ search for a
British policeman’s uniform. They
will attempt to remake one from
an American police oﬂ"1cer’s uni-
form. But if they don’t make a
costume which they all agree upon,
Jo says, “Well, I guess we'll just
have to cable England.”

The biggest problem’ which J 0
has had to face in dressing the
You Touched Me cast is their size.
J 0 says, “They're a wonderful cast,
a very, very nice looking cast, but
they are the smallest people.”

She continued. by telling about
Mary Hren who plays the maid in
the show. “Mary is only 4’ 11"
and wears a size 7 dress. And Sue
Delphey is a size 9 in width and
about a size 16 in length.”

Spring Period
Dink Program
Labeled Failure

If the lack of freshman dinks
during the ﬁrst few weeks of
spring semester is any indication,
it would seem that the Men’s
Council dink program has fallen
apart.

Whether the fault lies with
Men’s Council in not enforcing the
policy or with a non-conformist
freshman class, however, has not
been determined.

It is believed by some that the
dink program has not been stress-
ed enough to allow for its growth.

Men’s Council President Jack
Burwinkle takes a positive ap-
proach to the dink problem. Bur-
winkle claims that the success of
such a project depends on:

1) a greater cooperation of cam-

pus organizations.
a sincere and active interest
of upper classmen in mak-
ing the Upperclass Patrol ef-
fective in enforcing the dink-
wearing rule.

Though the dink period for this
semester is officially over, the ori-
entation program is still under-
way with freshmen and transfer
students attending classes led by
student leaders.

mittee is headed by Jack Morgan.

Vestal Virgins Live
Again as APhi0’s

Taking a page from ancient Roman history and the mod-
ern Olympic games, Spring Festival planners will have a
“Vestal Fire” burning during the three-day carnival.

A huge urn will be erected on the Cathedral lawn near

Heinz Chapel. A ceremony will:

take place, marking the ofﬁcial
beginning of the Carnival with
the lighting of the symbolic ﬁre.
The ﬁre will burn night and day
on the campus until the end of
PITT-y the ROMANS week.

In place of the Vestal Virgins
who guarded and tended the orig-
inal Vestal Fire, members of Al-
pha Phi Omega honorary service
fraternity, will guard the ﬁre in
relays. Tents will be erected and
members will stand watch during
the night to prevent the ﬁre from
being extinguished.

In Roman history, the Vestal
Fire was a symbol of the spirit of
the Roman people. Its symbolism
was derived from the fact that the

ﬁre was never permitted to go‘

out, just as the spirit of the R0-
mans was never supposed to be
extinguished.

commencement was rained out,
and Syria Mosque was used as an
alternate. Two ceremonies had to
be held, however, to accommodate
graduates and audience.

Another objection to the Field
House site was lack of parking
facilities, a factor which objec-
tors say would work a hardship
on elderly guests who would have
to climb the hill.

Sometimes, according to com-
mencement planner Viers Adams,
University oﬂicials have not

not the weather would permit

Talk Not Dangerous

A complete resume of the Co-
lumbia educator’s talk revealed
nothing that a Taft Republican
could object to. The feeling was
that Mr. Garman had not made a
convincing case of his. pro-com-
rnunist charges.

Garman, who says he has “been
investigating subversives for 30
years,” said he was preparing
a complete statement for release
outlining his position more thor-
oughly.

Graduation

Rock’s suggestion for the Field
House be set up as an alternate to
the lawn in case of rain, that the
University would have a great ex-
pense securing folding chairs for
the outdoor site and for the indoor
one.

Even now, Pitt has to send as
far as Buffalo, New York for the
several thousand chairs needed on
the lawn.

NSA Entry
Postponed

The entrance of Pitt in the Na-
tional Student Association is a
question that will hang ﬁre for
another year, it was learned to-
day.

According to Student Congress
President Cyril Wecht, the ad-
ministration has given unoﬁicial
okay to Congress’ entry into NSA,
which calls itself a “national stu-
dent voice,” but the solons have
been given to know that they can
expect no increase in their appro-
priation to pay for membership in
the organization.

Estimates orr the cost of belong-
ing to NSA have been as high as
$1000 per year, if the full number
of delegates, to which a school
Pitt’s size is entitled, are sent to
national conventions.

University administration has
also informed Congress that it
will not appropriate a special
amount for membership in the or-
ganization.

Wecht explained that, since it
is too late for this year’s Congress
to enter NSA, the incumbent so-
lons will recommend to the in-
coming Congress certain fund-
raising techniques by which the
special money could be obtained.

National Student Association of-
fers a three-fold program to its
members, Wecht said. It serves as

Student Congress has long operated under
the theory that they represented the entire

’ student body. They have labored for an ‘

equally long time with the knowledge that
the student body is largely unconcerned with
their activities. , .

The only time the relationship even ap-
proximates intimacy is when elections take
place each spring. Then a small percentage
of theconstituents turn out to cast their bal-

it _1ots. After that, the legislators are on their

own; the yoters and everyone else sits back
and reads about them. A A '

GENE WEINSTEIN

The college man is under ﬁre again. For years
the House Committee on un-American affairs thun-
dered about the radicalism supposedly prevalent
on the campuses. Then critics damned the colle-
giates for their “apathy.”

Now from Chicago comes the latest assault
upon the nation’s ﬁnest. The source is the Na-
tional Association of Retail :
Clothiers and Furnishers. '

Convention chairman Morris A
Myers minced no words. “The
dress on the campus,” he said, -
“cannot even be characterized as .
casual today—it is undress.” A

At first, one might dismiss
claims as propaganda

aimed at increasing sales. An im-
partial survey, however, con-_  
ducted by this department, su stantiated the
clothier’s assertion.

Myers’ observations raise certain serious ques-
tions. What good is it, for instance, for us to
have a college education if we fail to look the
part?

) To overcome our dress deﬁciences, a course on
the subject could be offered by the College. It

There seems to be a certain-

type of American who feels that

he can get through his day with-
out hearing criticism of our rug-
ged, indivilualistic way of earn-
ing a living. He cherishes the

ditions.

If you are
to judge from
the e x p r es-
sions of this sort of patriot, the
press, the pulpit and the rostrum
are in the hands of a horde of
silky-tongued subversives who
are out to corrupt the young, the
old and even the inﬁrm. We are,
apparently, completely surround-
ed by people who seek to change
our form of government by rev-
olutionary means.

It is just this kind of Ameri-

 

   

C can who was responsible for the

furore over Dr. Counts who
spoke here and at Tech yester-
day. They felt that Dr. Counts
was going to woo’ all of his lis-
teners over to the heresies of the
communist philosophy.

It has never been established
conclusively or legally that Dr.
Counts is, or ever was, a com-
munist. There is, however, am-
ple evidence that his politic-al
and social philosophy is consid-
erably to the left of, say, Robert
Taft or even General Eisenhow-
er, if he has such a philosophy.
He is, in short, a liberal or, in
the latest terminology, a person
with “leftist tendencies.”

Must Find New Enemies

Since the communists have
been generally swept out of posi-
tion where they might inﬂuence
people, the ﬁght has shifted from
them to the “leftist.” Herein-lies
the greatest threat to the system
which the patriots seek to pro-
tect. ‘

Now that they have vanquish-
ed the commies, they must have
something else to stalk. They
have so convinced themselves
that subversion is rampant, that
they must prove it and the only
way they can do so if by ﬁnding
the best reasonable facsimile of
a commie available.

This man will most often be
found in the academic world,
long ‘notorious as a hotbed of free
thinking.

Fulton Lewis Jr., a so-called
columnist who rose to fame and
a. good job with Hearst for his
exposures of the commies in gov-”

- ernment, industry, labor and re-

ligion, was jubilant the other
day over the Supreme Court’s
upholding of a New York loyalty

 law, This law, he said, will en-

able that state to rid its school
system of communist and others
with left—wing tendencies.

He was, inadvertantly, admit-
ting that the commies were about
used up as column material. Now
he and his cohorts can turn to
the vastly large and probably
more appetizing business of
hounding the lefties out of their
jobs. ~

Pinks Not ‘So Easy

They will run into a lot of
trouble with these birds because
while our ignorant voters may

to be almost anyone.

What on earth would Fulton
Lewis have said about Thomas
Jefferson if he were still lectur-
ing? Or Thomas Paine? Even
more interesting, what would
they have said about Fulton
Lewis J12?

These patriots are possibly
congenital cowards. They think
that suppressing dissent and
squelching deviation will make
this country strong. They think
that their actions are American.
They assume that we are all
fools, too stupid to detect an
hereticx when we see one. »

They make the mistake of as-
suming that criticism is un-
healthy and that we don’t want
to hear criticism. They are pa-
thetically _, ignorant, but they
have a cause.

Soon the Democrats will be
under ﬁre, not as being scoun-
drels, but as being un-American.
If they continue, you can look
forward to the time when Mr.

Pegging the Ego    

Portents of a revolution in the effete art ol
fund-raising are abroad on campus.

The newest way to extractthe buck from the
moneyed interests harks back to the medieval
monks——abnegation of the self. '

AWhen campus gave1—bangers and mellowed

ing eggs for common passersby
-—and all to secure some stray
scratch for the Pitt .Chest—then,
indeed, have fund raisers re-
nounced the joys of this world
for the sake of the cause.

Historically, the earliest fund
raiser was Robin Hood, who took
from the rich to give to the poor.
This is the aggressive approach.

But many aggressive campaigners, with the
comingof law and order, turned to the “.superior"
method, which is to speak nobly before a group of
potential contributors, and by beauty of rhetoric
and ideal to shame them into granting up the gold.

Andnow the prospect looms of the fund-raiser

assuming the duties of a menial so that the Chest '

will live. '

\University deans, faculty members, student leg-
islators——everybody is offering himself up as a
sacriﬁce on the altar of charity.

There. must be some hidden truth here. Perhaps,
an under-the-surface ill-feeling on the part of the
average citizenry to its leaders is what is”counted
on to bring the coins in. ‘Do average Joes like to
see their leaders fall from the heights to shine
shoes? This is pregnant with meaning. ‘

Also, a homegrown’ psychoanalyst would have
a ﬁeld day investigating the various ways campus
leaders decide to humble \themselves. ‘When A I

It willbe interesting to seehow the Chest comes p

out in this new-type campaign. Students ambitious
for campus supremacy are no doubt holding their
breaths. Who knows but that future requirements
for high campus political p-osts may not include
new and untried methods of self-renunciation.

Doc’s Nurse Lauds System

By BORIS WEINSTEIN

Students who complain of
everything from nose drips to
stomach dips pause ﬁrst at
the desk of Ethel Woomer, regis-
tered nurse, before gaining en-
trance to the- 34th ﬂoor Men’s
Health Service.

One suffering visitor, wanting

immediate attention, insisted that

“she ‘would make an excellent top
sergeant rather than a receptionist
for Dr. H. C. Carlson.”

Dr. Carlson, though, will disa-
gree with that statement. He has
had Miss Woomer’s services for
nine and a half years and besides
admiring her professional ability,
jokingly claims that “she knows
as much about basketball as my
boys do. In fact, that’s what I tell

_ them at practice, too.”

A Carlson Fan

Miss Woomer comes by basket-
ball through the work that the
Doctor posts in front of her day
after day. “After typing letters
week after week to the boys dur-
ing the summer,” she remembers,
“I had the desire to see what those
letters were all about.”'

And that was six years ago.
Since then Miss, Woomer has .at-
tended most of the home hoop
contests and even takes in the Sat-
urday afternoon football games at
the Stadium.

This little bit of basketball savvy
entitles her to judge Carlson’s
famed offense, too, just like the
restof us.‘ .

Abolish Financial Am‘
‘‘I can’t understand why the fans

say the Doctor’s system is out-‘

dated. Why every summer,” she
explains, “he figures out new plays
to increase the effectiveness of the
ﬁgure eight. They even call it the

continuity now, proving that he’5
modernized it.

But when it comes to overem-
phasis in collegiate athletics, Miss
Woomer doesn’t approve. “It’s
gone too far, giving so much money
to boys to participate in athletics.
Why don’t they hire a pro team

‘ and let them represent the school?

“If the boys are here primarily
for an education,” she reasons,
“why don’t they give them_ five-
year scholarships, and make it
easier for them to study. I won-
der how the Duquesne players

keep up with their studies?”

Miss Woomer even had’ the an-
swer to queries about an assist-
ant coach to Dr. Carlson next
year. “They gave him a football
man (Edgar Jones) last time, so
maybe they’ll see ﬁt to pass along
a track man next.”

She graduated from St. Mar-
garet’s- Hospital in Lawrenceville
in 1938 and worked there as a
nurse for three and a half years.
It wasn’t till 1942 that Miss
Woomer retired to'a desk job for
Dr. Charles Schmitt, dermatologist.

Gunners Fight By-Laws
In Debate Over T itle;

, A peculiar off-the-range de-
bating match may cost the
Pitt ~riﬂe team the champion-
ship of the Greater Pittsburgh Ri-
ﬁe League. -

Coach Paul Bryant’s riﬂers have
apparently clinched at least a tie
with West Virginia for the cham-
pionship, but a previously incon-

. spicuous league by-law may give

the title to the Mountaineers.

Major Nichols of West Virginia,
who is President of the League
Executive Committee, claims that
under the by-laws, the highest ag-
gregate team score for the entire
season determines- the champion-
if a tie prevails.

Something Rotten?

Coach Bryant, on the other hand,
is unaware that any such by-law
is in the books.

Speaking of Pitt’s last two wins,
that practically assured a dead-
lock, Bryant says, “Our wins take
the luster from a West Virginia
title even if we don’t win it our-
selves.” ‘

The odd situation developed
when'Pitt trimmed Carnegie Tech
and California State Teachers last
Tuesday to end their regular sea-
son.

Meet Mounties Tomorrow

The Panther sharpshooters now
have a 9-1 record as compared to
a 7-1 chart for the Mountaineers.
But West Virginia is an over-
whelming favorite to win their
remaining two matches, which
would again cause a deadlock.

If the League Executive Com-
mittee upholds Major Nichols’
contention on the by-laws, West
Virginia will then receive the title.
Otherwise, the championship will

To add to the tension, West Vir-

the comparative Pitt-WVU show-
ing can have no direct bearing on
the title dispute, it may be a sup-

Pitt Chest To Benefit
From All-Sports Night

By JACK DAVEY

Everyone will get into the act at the Field House Mar.
21, when the University of Pittsburgh will present its first
Intramural Sports Carnival, largely through the eﬁorts of
IM Director Leo Bemis, who has worked on the project for

two months.

The wide variety of action will begin next Friday eve-

ning at 6:30 p.m. and will include everything from_ girl cheer

leaders to wrestling. Admissioné

will be 25 cents with all proceeds
to go to the Pitt Chest.

has ranked with the top ten play-
ers in the Pittsburgh district for
the past several years.

The Fraternity “A” League bas-
ketball championship will also be
decided when Phi Gams meet
PiKA in the ﬁnals or what has
been the best—played season in
recent years. Three other games
are on tap including a contest be-
tween the Fraternity All-Stars
and the Independent All-Stars.

The girls will be contributing
their share in one of the games
when two teams from the Wom-
en’s Athletic Association play in
an exhibition match.

Doc Carlson retiring. After 30 years at the Pitt basket-
ball helm is the popular Doctor ready to call it quits?

Carlson, on hearing the

rumor of his proposed re-

’ tirement, commented, “It’s one of those things that comes

up. No one has suggested to

me that I quit. And as far

as the top brass informing me, it hasn’t been brought to

me directly or indirectly.” 9

lt’s no secret that Pitt’s hoop
mentor was disappointed in the
reaction to the Penn State ﬂasco.,
His post—game
statement—“A s
long as the boys
were satisfied”
—was a weak
attempt of ex-
cusing the in-
evitable.

And it’s no
secret that Cap-
tain Hamilton
wasn’t particu-
larly pleased
with the Penn
State extravagance, either.

It seems that the Penn State
game was the signal for rumors
to begin on Carlson’s retire-

until he is forced to retire-—by

nature or otherwise.

-After a season of ups-and-
downs, Pitt’s basketball future
appears brighter than it has been
in the last four years. This year
the hoopsters ﬁnished the season
with ﬁve men—-including only one

;senior. One starting member was
; njured midway in the season and

 

several others were ‘eliminated’ by
grades. '

Next year’s starting ﬁve is prac-
tically a ﬁxture, already. Regu-
lars returning are Dick Deitrick,

with Phi Gamma Delta for the IF
championship next Friday.

The low score can be attributed
to the haram scaram type of play
in which the ball traveled every-
‘where but through the hoop.

In the second quarter a new low
was reached as both teams to-
gether could collect only four
points. Three went to the PiKA’s,
while Delta Tau Delta garnered
one and the intermission lead, 9-6.

The ﬁnal minutes of the third
period showed signs of a faster
pace, but the battle settled down
and at the end of the quarter the
score stood at 14-12 with the
PiKA’s on top.

In the ﬁnal stanza both teams

Phi Gams followed the same
script they wrote last year as they
won the right to compete with
PiKA for the Fraternity League
championship Mar. 21, by down-
ing Sigma Chi at the Stadium,
37-34.

The Fiji’s lost to the Sigs dur-
ing the regular season last year
and this year, but came back both
times to win in the playoffs.

Sigma Chi started the fray by
sinking seven out of eight ﬁeld
goals and jumped to a 14-6 ﬁrst
quarter lead. In the second quar-

'ter the Phi Gams took over and

held the Sigs to only two points,
tying the game at 16-16.

The second half was touch and

Solomon Mat
Most Valuable

Capping a season of bril-
liant performances,‘ freshman
sensation Joe Solomon was
chosen ‘the most valuable Pitt
wrestler by his teammates yester-
day.

In the same balloting, 130-pound ‘

veteran Harold Miller, who is now
out of action with a knee injury,
was elected honorary captain for
the past season. During the regu-
lar season, a different captain was
chosen for each meet.

Solomon’s most valuable selec-
tion was earned through a 9-1-1
season chart and 39 points scored

in dual competition, highest total‘

on the team. '

‘His closet rival, 123-pound Hugh
Peery, has almost an equally im-
pressive record—36 points and a
10-1 chart. -

Both he and Solomon, along
with John George, George Mat-
thews, and Charley Uram are now
aiming for more honors in the
Four I tournament at Cleveland
today and tomorrow.

ment. 1, for one, believe that
when the hoop campaign begins
next year, Carlson will be in the
same position he has held the
past 30 years—unless he is ﬁred.

He has shown through the years
his love to pull the unexpected and
it’s not his nature to change espe-
cially in such an important mat-
ter as his coaching position. Carl-
son will be back, if only to tor-
ment Penn State’s Elmer Gross.

A Hobby for Doc

Gross "calls Pitt’splay disgust-
ing; Carlson would only be a de-
featist if he quit now, and that is
not his nature. _

It’s not the money that has
kept Carlson here for so long,
basketball is a hobby to him and
he’ll keep devising new and
stranger clownish antics at Pitt

time. After all, it was just three
years ago that the University made
an effort to obtain high school
basketball stars. And Carlson isn’t
going to run out when the future
looks so bright.

And for those who have their
doubts about Carlson’s future, per-
haps you can make yourself a
prophet from the following—a
quotation from one of Carlson’s
letters to a Penn State student
‘asking for information on the
freeze. .

It reads, “Further, your report
may be informative and even
newsworthy. If the game (Pitt-
State) is rescheduled for next
year and basketball rules re-
main the same, you may make
yourself a- prophet or a great‘
prognosticator because the same
ﬁasco may be repeated as a

symbol of inequities.”

M itterling Looks Over Squad

In First Outdoor Hitting Drill

By RUSS FRANKE ’
Spring is oﬁicially here for the overﬂow turnout of base-
ball hopefuls who swarmed over the Stadium turf Wednes-
day for the ﬁrst outdoor workout of the year.

Up ti1l_Wednesday, Coach Ralph’

Mitterling and his boys had been
restricted to bunting, sliding, and
throwing practice in the “hole”
under the ﬁeld, but outside they
can get down to the real business
of hitting and intra-squad games.

This gives Coach Mitterling a
chance to test his inﬁeld and base-
running as well as the batteries
under actual playing conditions,
although the plowed-up Stadium
is far from an adequate diamond.

Candidates Plentiful

“It’s too early to tell who is go-
ing to be in thestarting lineup,”
he says. “I have a lot of candi-
dates to choose from, and right
now the main thing is condition-
ing.”

The unusually large turnout is
due to the eligibility of freshmen
this year, plus the fact that com-
paratively few players were lost
from last season’s squad.

No one has nailed‘ down a job
yet, but Coach Mitterling and As-
sistant Coach Bobby Lewis expect
good results from veteran pitchers
Paul Lomond, Bob Russell, Ray
Hollis, Elmer Guckert, and Bill

Warnick, along with a few rookies
on the 17-man mound staff.
Opener April 3

Since 18 candidates showed up
for the inﬁeld, some of them may
have to be switched to the outﬁeld,
where only ﬁve men have signed
up. The list of 18 includes a pair
of ﬁne shortstops in Dave Devey
and Chuck Reese.

First base is a bit crowded, also,
with Bill Marhefka and Pat Mur-
phy making the choice a little
tough at present.

,But Coach Mitterling has three
more weeks to round out the ros-

ter and get in shape for the opener
at Ohio State Apr. 3.

NOTRE DAME and Pitt

will tangle in three different
sports this spring. The sched-
ule shows a baseball double-

meet May 3, at home, while the
