Montefiore Hospital home o
experimental laser surgery

By Joelle Latlne
The Pitt News

The word “laser” is an acronym
for Light Amplication by the Stimu-
lated Emission of Radiation. The
radiation used-is non-ionizing, and
therefore presents no health ‘risks.

There are many types of lasers,
butthe one used in neurosurgery

and general surgery is called the car- I

bon dioxide laser. It is actually a
laser within a laser. The neon laser
inside emits an argon red color. It
shows doctors where the beam is
coming through,_ because the beam
itself is actually in the part of the

, light spectrum that is invisible to the

naked eye. 2
The laser is used only in the oper-

ating room and sometimes the use of .

a microscope is needed by the
surgeon. ,

The physics behind the laser deals
with the emission of protons that
bounce off mirrors in a very excited
state. The protons go through a car-
bon dioxide medium and come out
as a great quantity of heat.

At Montefiore Hospital, Dr.
Steven I. Kaltman is performing
surgery that is unique to Monteﬁ-
ore. Kaltman is an oral and maxilla-
facial surgeon, which means he deals
with the treatment of disorders and
injuries of the oral cavity, face and

contiguous facial structures. With
the carbon dioxide laser, he removes
lesions, benign or malignant tumors

in the oral cavity and also blood ves-

sel tumors in this area.

In this type of surgery, the laser
has many functions. It seals blood
vessels so the surgeon can work in a
bloodless field, it cuts tissue like a
hot knife, it sterilizes the area, coag-
ulates blood so there is minimal if
any scarring, and it gives the surgeon

far more precision when removing

tissue. With a laser a tumor can’t be
spread around, as it can with a
scalpel.

The disadvantage it has is that it
takes up to 14-21 days to heal

SMART group seeks lawto ban
all alcohol commercials    

By Kurt Weinschenker
The Pitt News

The scene for the battle‘ to ban
beer and wine advertisements from
the airwaves shifted to Las Vegas,
Nev., where the National Associa-
tion of Broadcasters is holding its
annual convention. At stake are
some $900 million in billings for
broadcasters, locally and nationally.

Efforts to restrict what the alco-
holic beverage industry may say in
an ad on radio or television have
been going on since I982. In March
of that year, the Center for Science
in the Public Interest, which is a
Washington, D.C.—based public pol-

Our golden years may be tarnished if cur-

icy group, sent 80 manufacturers of
alcoholic beverages its suggestions
for standards concerning beer and
wine ads for broadcast media.
Among other things, the Center
didn’t want the companies to use
current or former athletes in ads. In
addition, it wanted beer and wine
ads not to suggest alcohol will con-
tribute to success in life, and not to
depict people using alcohol in risky
situations, such as sports car racing.
The Center also wanted beer and
wine makers to refrain from target-
ing ads at the college market, and
not to show their ads until after 9:00
p.m. According to George Hacker,
the director for alcohol policy at the
Center for Science in the Public

 See page 4

Interest, none of the 80 companies

responded to those suggestions. The
Center has founded project
SMART (Stop Marketing Alcohol
on Radio and Television) in an
effort to drive alcoholic beverage
ads from broadcast media.

For its part, the broadcasting
industry doesn't think beer and wine
ads should be legislated off the air-
waves. “The SMART people have a
neo-prohibitionist mentality,” said
Rory Benson, the vice-president of
public affairs for the National Asso-
ciation of Broadcasters. “We started

Library thefts up
as term nears end

By Susan Benedek
The Pitt News
As the end of the term

approaches, more thefts occur at
Hillman Library, according to cam-
pus police. ‘

“At the beginning and end of each
term we have more book thefts,"
stated campus police officer Patricia
Herchenroether. “Mainly the books
are stolen and then resold at the
bookstores where the person
receives cash for them,” Herchen-
roether said. .

Hillman Library has become bus-
ier in the past few weeks as students
are finishing last—minute research or
studying for finals.

“It stands to reason, the more peo-
ple at the library, the greater the
opportunity for theft," said Ingrid
Glasco, reference librarian.

The library has signs posted warn-
ing not to leave valuables unat-
tended. “However, many people
don’t read signs,” said Glasco. “I've

seen people come in and use the card
catalogs or the encyclopedias and
they leave their purses and valuables
sitting unguarded at one of the
tables. They are inviting trouble,”
Glasco said.

Library employees advise that it is
a good idea to take your valuables
with you. If that is impossible, ask
someone nearby to watch your
belongings. I

“Sometimes people don’t like it if
you remind them. We are not trying
to be didactic. We are only trying to
help,” Glasco said.

“At the beginning of the term, one
boy went to the men’s roomor some-
thing and his things were just picked
up," said Bill Forsythe, supervisor
for the third and fourth floors of the
library. I

According to Forsythe, the third
and fourth floors are problem areas
for theft because of the secluded car-
rels and tables.

CAS sophomore Peter Ward was
in that area last week when his text-
book was stolen. “I was on the
fourth floor at about seven o’clock

Sexagenarian oldest
heart implant patient

(UPI) — Jack Burcham is the world’s fifth and oldest person
to live on a permanent artificial heart after a six-hour operation
complicated by difficulties fitting his new heart in his chest

Humana Hospital Audubon’s chief medical spokesman said
the 62-year-old Burcham has a smaller chest cavity than pre-
vious artificial heart recipients, and doctors had to remove a

Burcham got the implant in the same Louisville operating
room where surgeon William DeVries carried out earlier
implants for Bill Schroeder and Murray Haydon.

Just before surgery began at Humana Hospital Audubon,
Burcham exhibited a positive attitude by declaring, “Let’s go
for it.” A hospital spokesman reported the mechanical heart is
“working perfectly.” The patient is now in the same coronary
care unit where Haydon is recovering from an unexplained

The spokesman for the hospital said DeVries carefully
checked-Burcham’s chest cavity for bleeding before closing it
up. Both Schroeder and Haydon had to have their chests
reopened for surgery to correct excessive bleeding.

The greatest risk to the world’s fifth artificial heart recipient,
who was given only a month or two to live with his own heart, is
infection and a pre-existing kidney problem.

MADD [Mothers Against Drunk
Driving] is emotionalizing this issue,
and the SMART people arejust pig-
gybacking on it," Benson said.

Benson ‘ pointed proudly to a
broadcasters’ survey which found
that 97 percent of local stations
polled had put on some sort of pub-
lic affairs programming on the sub-
ject within the past year.

Hacker wasn’t impressed by that
claim in the slightest. “Sure, we’ve
seen a frenzy of drunk driving PSAs

[Public Service Announcements].
The message we’re getting now is
‘Don't drive drunk.’ But rarely do we
see the message ‘Don’t get drunk.‘
lt’s a very limited approach to the
problem,” Hacker said.

In addition, Hacker claims the
National Association of Broadcast-

ers tried to subvert the PTA, which ,

supported its efforts, by trying to
break off local PTAS from the
national organization. “John
Summers [a high—ranking Broad-
casters’ official] sent a memo to

work, Hacker said.

Benson doesn't think that is the
issue. “Drunk driving is a national
problem, but it requires a local solu-
tion. What we’re tryingto do is work
at the local level with stations to
raise the consciousness of the public
about drinking and driving,” Ben-
son said.

The U.S. Senate has already held
hearings on the subject. In May the
House of Representatives will hold
hearings, and some legislation will
probably be introduced at that time.

The campus police have plain-
clothes officers monitoring trouble
areas of the library. “Where thefts

because of the great power that the
cells have absorbed. I

“The safety aspects are very criti-
cal,” said Kaltman. The patients are
awake during the surgery and
receive local anesthesia. The patient
is covered with wet towels all over
the body and the eyes are protected.
Surgeons, nurses and operating
room assistants must also wear pro-
tective glasses. The instruments used
are black, so there is no reflection if
the laser would happen to hit the
patient or the instruments.

Patients are usually able to leave
the same day ofthe operation, there-
by reducing hospital expenses.

The question was asked: What are
lasers going to do for us in the
future? “We envision in about five
years that we will be able to dial in a
laser,” said Kaltman. Presumably, a
surgeon could then walk into an
operating room with one machine
composed of several different types
of lasers and be able to set it to the
desired laser for each patient.

The Aging America

The latest report from the Census Bureau should not
come as a surprise: The United States is becoming an

older country.

The median age of Americans in 1971 was 27.9 years.
The Census Bureau has determined the median age of the
nation to be 31.2 years as of July 1 of last year. For nearly
15 years, the median age of the U.S. has been inching up.
“This aging trend is expected to continue as the early
baby boom generations head toward middle age,” the '

study said.

The middle-aged are the fastest growing segment of
our population, according to the report. The second
fastest growing segment, thanks to rapid advances in
medical treatment and technology, is that of people over
the age of 85. The number of people aged 14 to 17
declined 9.5 percent and those between the ages of 5 and

13 fell by 3.2 percent.

As these trends in the aging of America continue, the
population will be like an inverted pyramid, the old being
by far the majority with fewer and fewer young people.

The aging of America has tremendous impact on a
whole host of issues, most significantly on Social Secur-
ity. As the system is set up now, the young people at the
base of that inverted, pyramid will not be able to support
what will be the majority of the population —— those
receiving Social Security payments. _

Much hype and hoopla was made by Congress and the
Reagan Administration when it “solved” the ﬁscal crisis
facing Social Security last year. Compared with the crisis
to come, it was no solution at all, merely a band-aid, a
postponement of the inevitable collapse of Social

Security.

. The solution was very popular with the powerful vot-
ing bloc that is the elderly, and very timely, coming just
before an important presidential election.

But in the meantime, the working people of America
are paying higher Social Security taxes into a system that
a majority will never be able to collect from.

Narrow minded

An article published in the April
10 edition of The Pitt News “From
The Foul Line,” appalled us. The
author of this article made some
narrow-minded statements about
homosexual behavior but also chose
to juxtapose this view with his per-
sonal values of friendship. What
were the author’s motives? Were
they to denounce homosexuality, to
question values of friendship orjust
a way of revealing a friend’s most
trusted secret? It is our hope, for the
sake of the person discussed in the
article and journalistic ethics, that
the references made to the individu-
al’s identity were fallacious.

Regardless of this author’s
motives, we are most disgusted with
this individual’s closed view of
homosexuality and his need to pub-
lish this view. Our society is filled
with prejudice, and the fact that such
unjustified hostility exists has been a
reason that so much catastrophe has
occurred. The fact that anyone
should feel differently about another
person because oftheir race, religion
and — yes, even their sexual prefer-
ence — is a commentary of the
changes that need to occur in our
society. The real sickness and “unna-
turalness” that exists in our society is
the fact that this prejudice exists, not
the fact that our sexual preference
can vary.

The author’s predicament is the
rawest example of true prejudice. If
the author’s friend had changed his
race, would the friendship still exist?

Since this article is an opinion, I
will state my opinion with regards to
friendship. Friendships are one of
the greatest strongholds of our
society. lfwe let our prejudices stand
in the way of our friendships, then
true friendship never existed. Two of
the most crucial words in the defini-
tion of friendship are understanding
and acceptance. Come on, people, if
you cannot be understanding and
accepting of society in general, at
least be so of your friends!

Magnanimous

We would just like to express our
admiration of Mark A. Sindler's

magnanimous gesture in not ostra-

.:~..

cizing his friend of eight years when
he decided to be honest and to
entrust him with his “secret.” We
just hope that he will not waver from
such a noble and open-minded act
and unjustly destroy the friendship
he has.

To assist him in this,_we would
like to offer him some information
which we hope he will find most
helpful.~ First, notice that you and
your friend are still the same people
you both were before he told you.

Did he suddenly put on a dress? Did.

his wrists begin to go limp? Did he
start to talk with a lisp? Well,
wonder of all wonders, we bet he
didn’t, just like your seat did not sink
through the ﬂoor.

Secondly, how do you know that
the joy of planned procreation is
unparalleled? Have you tried?
Furthermore, you only runithe risk
of AIDS with the transmission of
body ﬂuids. Have you tried this? As
far as your use of the term “natural”
goes, to those of us who participate
in your so-called “cruel, degrading
pattern,” there could be nothing
more natural.

The debate concerning whether or
not homosexuality is natural is
absurd, due to the fact that for it to
be unnatural, there would have had
to have been a choice to be gay made
at some point. We personally know
of no one who woke up one day and
chose to suddenly be gay. Homosex-
uals grow up homosexual, as hetero-
sexuals grow up heterosexual. Did
you wake up one day and decide to
be heterosexual? We thought not.

Lastly, since we have hopefully
helped you from wavering in your
acceptance, we now hope that you
can go on, expand your limited
knowledge and accept and befriend
other homosexuals.

Silent majority

Are you a commuter? Do you feel
you are being cheated because of it?
Well, it is your own fault! In this
university, it seems to us that the
residents rule. Commuters have the
majority in numbers; they also have
concerns but nobody wants to fix
them.

Most commuters come in during
the morning and sit in the student
union or the Cathedral when they

' t

are not in class. By now you are
probably bored. However, look
around and listen to what commut-
ers are saying. The few who do voice
their opinion are ignored or don't
know how to make others listen, all
because of the apathetic attitude of
most commuters. Sitting around our
table in the William Pitt Union, we
hear complaints about parking, bus
service and the fact that most activi-
ties are resident-oriented. We want
to send out a call to all commuters to
become involved. We are the major-
ity; therefore the majority of the uni-
versity should be centered around
commuters. After all, this is not
South Africa.

If we do become involved, we can
make changes. Voice your com-
plaints and get organized.

Names withheld by request

Conspiracy

It seems too convenient to me that
the university seems to profit from
every parking restriction the city
imposes on Oakland streets. Many
examples are available. I will name
two.

When Joncaire St. in south Oak-
land was made a no-parking zone
for no apparent reason, the Panther
Hollow parking at the bottom of
that hill suddenly increased its rates.
This little-used lot was suddenly
desirable and Pitt wasted little time
in sticking it to the driving
commuter.

In The Pitt News’ recent story on
resident parking areas, the Pitt
administration extolled the virtues
of this scheme for the residents while
directing commuters to the Pitt-
owned $2-a-day parking lots.

In the not too distant past, these
lots charged 60 cents a day, and
neither is a bargain at $2 a day, con-
sidering the fact that they are both a
good, steep distance from the center
of campus. Yet these are both
offered to the commuter as a viable,
nay, desirable alternative to the free
parking previously enjoyed.

Let’s face it, Pitt and the city are
conspiring to eliminate every pocket
of free parking as it becomes well-
known, in an effort to extract quar-
ters for the meters, or dollars for the
distant lots, from the poor students.
What can we do? “Take the bus!” say
they.

“Good luck in May!” say I!

Before the Dawn/Adam Eisenstat

Last Tuesday I found myself at
Zelda’s for their all-you-can—eat taco
special. This weekly ritual is basi-
cally ajoyless hour of waiting in line
to get to a table where a bored girl
mechanically scoops dripping meat,
lettuce, sauce and rubber cheese
from white buckets into two waiting
shells. I think I was up for my third
or fourth helping when “We are the
World,” or whatever that utterly
Saccharine song all the rock stars
made for African hunger relief is
called, started blaring over the
sound system.

I'm positive that the sublime irony
of this juxtaposition of American
victual opulence with a plea (this
particular one pretty ironic in itself)
for the starving was lost On the
essentially Pitt crowd present at the
time. I guess we can’t all be round-
the-clock irony miners, especially
not when free tacos and twenty-five
cent drafts beckon.

Whenever I partake of buffets and
sometimes even bottomless salad
bars (bland as they are), I think of
the Third World and their attendant
miseries. Now mind you, I’m no
bleeding heart or guilt-ridden, self-
hating, Western white boy. But the
differences in the American lifestyle
compared with those in various
sphincters of the world seem too
staggering to not think about. Aren’t

I lucky, I think, as I pile my plate
high and wide, that I don't live in the
Upper Volta.

I suppose being able to put things
in a broader perspective than my
own narrow appetites is no grounds
for smugness. But to understand the
dangerously hollow patriotism Of
Ronald Reagan and other home
bred, jingoistic, ugly American types
in this land of excess, one has to
understand the overwhelming
power of individual greed and
parochialism. When these two char-
acter traits dovetail, look out, world.

Parochialism, or narrow think-
ing, is truly a cancer of the mind.
This country, for all its pluralism
and diversity, unfortunately breeds
parochial thinkers like few places in
the world. The American strain Of
parochialism is an especially malig-
nant breed. As opposed to the back-
woods provincialism of small,
close-knit traditional societies,
American provincialism is spawned
in a highly modern and media-
drenched society. Ethnocentrism
here must be particularly resilient to
survive the evitable contact with
information. The most distressing
fact about American provincialism
is that it all too readily seeps into
positions of high power.

That Ronald Reagan, leader of
the free world, is probably less well

informed than the average person
who reads The New York Times
every day doesn't seem to bother too
many people. In Reagan we have a
man whose vision of America and
the world slices through and is obliv-
ious to all the periodicals, printouts
and reports one cO’uTd"ever imagine.
No dynamic thinker is he, our
patriot-in-chief.

I have no doubt that Reagan
really loves this country and believes
everything, or almost everything, he
says. I love this country too: quite a
bit, in fact. The feelings I have for
this country, though, cannot be syn-
opsized or validated in any pledge of
allegiance, loyalty oath Or symbol. A
willingness to brandish an M-l6and
maybe die for one’s country means
even less to me. I think to criticize is
often a symbol of love. I wouldn’t

A bother if I didn’t care. This sort of

love is more substantial and mean-
ingful than the so-called patriotism
that manifests itself in knee-jerk
sloganeering and blindness to the
country's ills.

Tacos, the starving, Reagan -
what’s it all mean? I don’t know. I
just live here. And I know there’ll be
more buffets, free beer and maybe
even  A BRAND NEW CAR
(c’mon downl). But hey — we are the
world, we are the children.

Glorified Closets

This is a photograph of the inside of Music Room B, one of three
so-called music rooms on the fifth ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union. It
was shot through the window. _

These rooms were set aside for musically inclined students to prac-
tice and were intended to contain pianos.

They are currently in use as closets — nothing more than storage
rooms. This photograph depicts but one of the rooms. At one point
last term, one of the music rooms was stocked to the ceiling with toilet
paper and janitorial supplies. That same room is now empty.

But it is not to be filled by a student organization. It will be used to
store furniture, according to officials.

These rooms should be put to the purpose for which they were
originally intended. Student singing groups have expressed interest in
gaining access to these rooms.

POLK, Pa. (UPI) —- Polk Center,
'a facility for the mentally handi-
capped in northwestern Pennsylva-
nia, has had its probation extended
for six more months by the state
health department. The Venango
County facility was ordered seven
months ago to correct violations of
78 government standards or lose $31
million in federal funds. Polk’s total
operating budget is $54 million.
Health department official Joyce
McNamara said the center was given
its first six-month provisional
license in September after a surprise
inspection. She said the department
found 78 violations in discipline,
programming and treatment defi-
ciencies. McNamara said a follow-
up inspection in February showed
Polk had made some corrections,
and a new provisional license was
issued through September.

Polk Center was named in a
recent State Senate study of the
treatment and care of mental
patients in 12 states. The study cited
“a climate of fear and intimidation,”
physical abuse and overuse of medi-
cation at the facilities. Other Penn-
sylvania centers included in. the
State Senate report were Pennhurst
State School in Chester County,
Woodhaven Center in Philadelphia
and Embreeville Center in
Coatesville.

 

(UPI) — The outbreak of milk-
related salmonella poisoning has

affected even more than the thou-
sands of Midwesterners suffering
from the intestinal disease. Consu-
mers are questioning the safety of
the food they buy in supermarkets
and victims have filed multimillion-
dollar lawsuits. The situation has
also forced Illinois governor James
Thompson to fire the state depart-
ment of health director for vacation-
ing in Mexico during the health
crisis.
 

(UPI) — President Reagan leaves
for Europe on April 30 to attend a
seven-nation economic summit.
Before he leaves, he faces three eco-
nomic hurdles. As he returns to
Washington from a 10-day Califor-
nia vacation, the president is prepar-
ing to lobby Congress for $14
million in aid to the Contras ﬁghting
the Nicaraguan government. He
also plans to promote the budget
compromise he struck with Senate
Republicans which would cut the
federal deficit by $52 billion. The
budget proposal hits the Senate
floor April 22. The Contra aid
comes to a Senate vote the next day,
and the House will vote on the issue
some time before Reagan ﬂies to
Europe two weeks from now. One
presidential aide described the
White House strategy for winning
those three votes as “a strong pitch
to the public and lots of gentle arm-
twisting.” Reagan begins today by
meeting with supporters of aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels.

In Brief

WASHINGTON (UPI) —— A
Maryland congressman said that the
Internal Revenue Service spends
more time .trying to catch tax evad-
ers than processing the refunds of
honest citizens. Democratic Repre-
sentative Michael Barnes has
released a report that shows that the
processing staff at the IRS has
dropped 30 percent since 1973 but
that the workload has increased by
24 percent. He said the IRS regional
center in Philadelphia has cut its
processing staff by 25 percent since
1983. Since 1983, the IRS has
increased its investigations and col-
lections division by 52 percent.
Barnes said that while that means
more revenues, it is also slowing the
processing of income tax returns.

BEIRUT (UPI) —- The Christian
Voice of Lebanon Radio said that
Lebanese Army units and Druze
Moslem gunners traded artillery fire
yesterday in mountains overlooking
Beirut. Military sources said that the
shelling was particularly intense
near east Beirut. The Moslem
gunners, after firing several Soviet-
made rockets, pounded three Chris-
tian villages with artillery.

(UPI) -— The Iraqi News Agency
said Iranian positions were the
targets of Iraqi land and air force
attacks today. At the same time,
Iranian artillery pounded two Iraqi

border towns. A military statement
carried by the agency said Iraqi
helicopter gunships launched 23
bombing missions on Iranian posi-
tions in the southern section of the
battle front. The communique said
“heavy and accurate” blows were
inflicted on Iranian troops and mil-
itary equipment. The statement said
Iraqi front-line forces raided several
Iranian military outposts in the
northern, central and southern sec-
tors, killing at least l8 soldiers and
“totally destroying” their positions.
There was no immediate comment
from Tehran on the border fighting.

(UPI) — The prosecution con-
tended well-to-do New York lawyer
Claus V_on Bulow tried to kill his
wife Martha with insulin so he could
marry his lover, Alexandra Isles.
They proved their case in 1982, but
the attempted murder conviction
was overturned last year on Consti-
tutional grounds. Now, the state is
trying to prove the charge a second
time in a Providence, R.l., court.
But just getting started is taking
time. Tomorrow will be the sixth
day of jury selection. In the mean-
time, Isles has disappeared and there
is speculation the former soap opera
actress will not return to testify a
second time. Von Bulow’s wife
remains in the insulin-induced coma
she slipped into in December 1980.
She is not expected to recover.

PHILADELPHIA (UPI) — A
spokesman for The Philadelphia
Inquirer said that talks between
management and janitors and por-
ters will resume in an effort to end
the strike that halted delivery of yes-
terday‘s Inquirer.

A newspaper representative said
that the workers refused to accept an
offer that would give them a 40-
percent salary increase by 1987. The
offer comes from Philadelphia
Newspapers Inc., which publishes
the Inquirer and Daily News.

The walk-out began just after
midnight on Saturday, and union-
ized truck drivers refused to cross
the picket lines.

The representative also said that
he expects that reporters, who are
members of the Newspaper Guild,
will honor the strike.

 

MADRID (UPI) —- The Spanish
government said that the Islamic
Jihad terrorist group is suspected of
planting a bomb that killed 18 Span-
iards in a steak house near Madrid
on Friday night. According to offi-
cials, 82 people were killed, includ-
ing l5 Americans. Officials said that
the bombing was believed to be
aimed at American servicemen who
normally converge on the popular
restaurant on weekends. The bomb-
ing came less than a month before
President Ronald Reagan’s sched-
uled visit to Madrid. .

New city nightspot

1 mi: 31' at mews, Ntoxsuuy, Apr!!!‘ 133:“?! 983

promises adult fun

By Kurt Weinschenker
The Pitt News

When most people think of Pitts-
burgh night life, the Shadyside and
Station Square areas come to mind
first. But lately, the Greentree area
has been challenging them.

The Greenery in the Holiday Inn
had been known as a hot spot for
some time, and for a while had the
airport area business all to itself. But
in February, the Marriott in Green-
tree replaced the Trolley Bar with
Cahoots, and just last Friday, Con-
fetti became the latest addition to
the high-energy nightclubs in town.

Pittsburgh isn’t the only city in

. which Confetti is located. It is, how-

ever, the chain’s first expansion into
the northeastern United States —
and the wild-and-crazy party atmos-
phere it promotes has
successful enough to spawn 18 clubs
around the country in the past three-
and-a-half years.

“We’re ready to set Pittsburgh on
fire,” said Robin Fernandez, the
general manager of Confetti. “What

.we’re trying to do is provide adult

fun and excitement.”

Installing state-of-the-art light,
sound and video systems cost

lic corporation which owns all 18

Confettis, over $1 million. The 700-
square-foot dance ﬂoor looks worth
every penny, with multiple levels
and neon lights, not to mention the

smoke generators - and cannons S

which blow confetti over everyone
once every 20 minutes.

The whole emphasis at the club is
on fun, fun and more fun. The
employees get into the act by dress-
ing in outrageous costumes and min-
gling with the customers. Fernandez
likes that note. “To us, the liquor is
secondary," he said. “We provide an
adult fantasy land.”

While that adult fantasy land idea
might wear thin after a while with
the public, the management is deter-
mined to stay on top of the latest
trends of fashion, music and archi-
tecture. McFadden Ventures plans
to restyle the clubs approximately
once a year depending upon the
amount of business they’re doing.

Despite the fun-and-games
atmosphere, the nightclub, like the
Greenery and Cahoots, has an alco-
hol monitoring program the

employees adhere to. Fernandez’

explained that all bartenders and
waitresses are shown a 15-minute
videotape which teaches them how
to handle any possible situation.
Should a patron manage to become
too intoxicated to drive, the club will
send him home in a cab (at the club’s
expense).

Thirteen-mph winds and 35-
degree weather — sounds like per-
fect football weather, right? Right.
There was only one problem with
this perfect football weather: Base-
ball, not football was being played.
Ah yes, baseball. The all-American
sport Morn, apple pie, and
Chevrolet.

It is Tuesday, and the Pirates are
opening their 1985 season in Chi-
cago against the Cubs. Oh, Chicago.
That explains the weather, you say.

yourself is: What year is this? You

Pirate fans ‘wave’ hello to Pirates at opener

thought it was 1985, but after wit-
nessing the Pirates’ performance on
Tuesday, you start to think it’s 1984
all over again. OK, now, don’t get
upset — yet. It’sjust the first game of
the season and at least it wasn’t a
blow-out. They only lost 2-1. That's
certainly better than losing to
Detroit 18-3 in exhibition. Forget
the fact that Rick Rhoden gave up a
run in the first when the Cubs got
four hits, and again in the fourth
when Keith Moreland hit a home
run. Or the fact that the offense, if
that’s what you want to call it, pro-
duced only six hits and one run, and
Bill Madlock and George Hendrick
both struck out with runners in scor-
ing position. That’s OK, things like
this happen. The Pirates needed to
get it out of their system to remind

themselves that another I984 season
just won't do in Pittsburgh.

Well, it appears that getting it out
of their system was just what was
done, as was apparent at Friday’s
home opener. How about those
Bucs! A 6-4 win over the St. Louis
Cardinals, and the way they did it 
Fantastic! The weather was fantastic
as well. Everything was perfect.
Spring was in the air, and so were the
Pirates’ baseballs.

I was one ofthose 47,335 fans who
turned out at Three Rivers to “Help
bring back the Bucs,” and I must say
that of all the baseball games I’ve
ever attended this was the best. You
could feel the electricity in the air.
Everyone was up for the game, and
when Jason Thompson stepped to
the plate, after Bill Madlock drew a
two-out walk, and hit a two-run
home run into the center ﬁeld seats
— well, that was all it took. This
two-run shot was the shot heard
around the ‘Burgh. It was the cata-
lyst that would see the first inning
end with the Pirates leading 4-0.

There was more in store. George
Hendrick got his first hit as a Pirate
— at the expense of his former team-
mates. You see, I knew he was saving
his good performance for the home

opener instead of the season opener
— next year he’ll try and do it in
both games —— I hope. Hey, and how
about Tony Pena’s single that
brought Hendrick to third base and
Frobel's broken-bat single to right
that brought his two teammates
home. What an offense — a definite
difference over Tuesday‘s game. The
hitting was there on Friday and it
was superb!

Not only was the offense at Fri-
day’s game great but so was the

defense. The double plays were inﬁ,

bloom throughout the night as well
‘as individual defensive plays, like
Johnny Ray’s snare of a potential
run-scoring hit in the sixth by pinch-
hitter Mike Jorgenson. Needless to
say, Chuck Tanner was happy. .
Oh, and we can’t forget the pitch-
ing. It too was superb. Larry McWil-
liams started and kept the Cards
scoreless heading into the second
inning. Don Robinson relieved
Mcwilliams with two out in the fifth
and preserved the victory. Candy-

man John Candelaria came out off?)

the bullpen in the bottom of the
ninth to shut out the Cards on one
hit for the save.

Just writing this makes me feel
like I'm back in the ball park, beer in
one hand and trying to clap with the
other. I decided to join the other
Pirate fans in doing the wave, which
generated more excitement. I’m not
sure if I’ve ever seen the wave at a
baseball game before. Football yes,
but not baseball. It felt good to see
the fans cheering the team — our
team — on to victory and really get-
ting into the game. The electricity
generated by the fans was the extra
“umph” the Pirates needed but
didn’t have in Chicago on Tuesday.
If we could fill the stadium with
40,000 plus excited fans for most of
the games this season and really get
behind our Bucs, I think we could
see a World Series winner living in
our No. I City by October. I think we
need the No. l city’s fans to come out
and cheer, so  Let’s go Bucs!

Tennis team battles back to win 3 of 4

The Pitt track team traveled to
the Colonial Relays at William and
Mary College in Williamsburg, Va.,
recently in what proved to be a
record-breaking performance.

The Panther thinclads shattered
three school records in what was
their best showing at the Colonial
Relays, according to head coach
John Vasvary.

Leading the record-breaking con-
tingent was the 4xI00-meter relay
team of Calvin Holmes, Dorrell Hil-
liman, Rogers Thomas and Lee
McRae. Their time of 40.7 brought
them a second-place finish and qual-
iﬁed them for the lC4A Eastern
Championships. The 4xl600-meter
relay team of Mickey Rhitarchick,
Scott Able, Joe Daniels and Bob
Weiner also broke the school record
with a time of 17:1 1.5, surpassing the
old mark by three seconds. The shut-
tle hurdle relay team of Shane
Saunders, Jason Harris, Darryl
Shepherd and Holmes passed the
old school record of 58.2 with atime
of 57.3, good enough to secure the
victory. '

Holmes, who anchored the shuttle
hurdle team to victory with a colle-
giate personal best time of 13.8, ear-
lier won the open ll0-meter high
hurdles, edging out Villanova’s
highly-rated Martian Booker for top
honors. Holmes’ time of I4.0 quali-
fied him for the IC4As.

In other competition, Abel fin-
ished second in the 1500 meters with
a time of 3:56.3. Freshman George
Iffel’s leap of 23’ 1/4” left him in fifth
place in the long jump. The sprint
medley relay finished third with a
time of 3122.2, behind Villanova and
Howard University. The relay team
consisted of McRae, Hilliman, Alan
Laws and Tim Manes.

The women, now under the direc-
tion of Vasvary since the firing of
Elbert Kennedy, made their first
appearance at the relays. “They
responded well to the top competi-
tion of this meet, which is what they
need,” said Vasvary.

Junior Amy DiFranceseo ran a
4:5l.5 and freshman Lisa Williams
ran a 5:07.4 in the women’s open
I500 meters. Sue Torre, also a jun-

‘ ior, posted a time of 12.5 seconds in

the open I00 meters, while freshman
Dana Robert-s long-jump l6’l0.”

Vasvary was pleased with the
team’s performance. “We have a
long way to go but it’s a good start-
ing place for us,” he said.

. The team has this weekend off for
final exams but travels to the Penn
Relays next weekend. The meet will
put the Panthers up against some of
the best runners in the world.

The" men’s tennis team emerged
from a very active weekend of play
with a season mark of 12-6, winning
three of the four matches they
played. Highlighting the weekend
were twin wins on Sunday, as the
Panthers ,crushed St. Francis early
in the day 8-1 before having their
way with Duquesne en route to a 9-0
victory.

“It was a very good weekend for‘

us,” said a satisfied George Dief-
fenbach Sunday evening. “We
clinched a winning record for this
season and we tied the all-time
record for most wins in a season.”
Dieffenbach said he expects the
team to break the record in an
upcoming match with Slippery

Rock.

The four-match stretch did not
start out well for Pitt as the team was
soundly drubbed by West Virginia
on Friday 9-0. Not only could the
Panthers not manage to win a
match, they failed even to win a set
all day.

The crucial match for Pitt this
weekend was Saturday’s meeting
with the Big Indians ofIUP. Four of
the day’s nine matches went three
sets, with the Panthers able to win
three of those four. The match was
won in the second, third and fourth
singles slots.

“We pulled out the close matches
and that was the key to the win. In
those three singles matches we had
to come from behind. That shows
the dedication of our players,” Dief-
fenbach said.

Pitt’s Jeff Dadowski (second sin-
gles) came back to win after drop-
ping the first set 6-7. He then went

on to take the second and third sets
by identical 6-3 scores.

The story was much the same in
third and fourth singles — Pitt lost
the first set only to come back and
take the final two sets. Greg Camp-
bell (No. 3) came from behind to
down IUP’s Tony Medeets 4-6, 6-3,
6-3. And in the fourth singles slot,
Pitt’s Jack Kalla dropped Dan Mis-
enhelter after losing a tight opening
set 6-7. Kalla won the match 6-7, 6-3,
6-3.

On Sunday, the Panthers had a
rare doubleheader against St. Fran-
cis and Duquesne. Dieffenbach said
the double match was necessitated
by an earlier postponement of the
Duquesne match.

The Panthers had no trouble with
either club, losing only one set in the
two matches. Pitt not only had to
gear themselves up For two matches
in one day, but they also had to do it
without their top two players ——

—- who were out for personal rea-

to move Greg Campbell, his regular
No. 3 player, into the first slot.

Campbell was up to the challenge,
however; he played like he’d been
No. I all year, taking two straight set
victories. He defeated the No. I from
St. Francis 6-1, 6-2, and then went
on to down Jeff Mott of Duquesne
6-2, 6-1. '

, Dieffenbach was not surprised by
Campbell’s play. “Greg is the type of
player who plays as well as the com-
petition,” the coach said. “The better
his opponent, the better Greg plays.
Earlier in the year we played a few
Division III schools who weren't
that good and Greg had his prob-
lems with them. But I think that
what his play shows is the amount of
depth we have on our team this
year.”

Marino’s touchdown toss to John
Brown in the waning moments ofthe
Sugar Bowl, lifting the Panthers
over Georgia. Oh, what a feeling!

Then there was Clyde Vaughn, a
little more recent, slamming home
the ball during Pitt’s initiation into
the Big East Conference, which has
now reached the heights of collegiate
basketball by getting three of four
teams in the Final Four a few weeks
ago.

The memories haven’t all been
happy ones, however.

Bill Fralic, despite garnering All-
America honors for the fourth time,
was a lineman whose performance
mounted to “good," but not good
enough for some this season. He was
touted as a Heisman candidate in the
early going, but with the Panthers
headed for a 3-7-l season, the pan-
cakes didn’t stack up high enough.

fights and flying crutches.

Outgoing sports editor
Laurie Kubli

Students were unhappy with the
athletic department’s decision to ax
the men’s volleyball team and the
women’s field hockey team a few
years ago. An alleged skull-kicking
event put on by the Pitt rugby team
separated that team from the
university.

Quite a few coaching changes
were initiated this past academic
year. Several football coaches were
replaced following what many deter-
mined was a disappointing season.
The women’s basketball coach
resigned, and the women’s track
coach was fired.

Danny Marino. Born and raised
locally, he’s now a hero way down
south, splashing with the Dolphins.
He’ll always be remembered fondly
here.

Yes, many and varied have been
the notes of the Pitt athletic depart-
ment the past few years. This list is
by no means all-inclusive, but it
brings home the message: Life on‘
this Oakland campus is never dull. I
haven’t turned to stone yet, but I’m
almost a memory, a name in the
yearbook. Pitt’s voyage, like mine,
has had its share of calm waters and
rough, but for me, the ship has come
to port.

Put money where sports are it

By Laurie Kubll
The Pitt News

The relationship between the
almighty buck and the promiscuity
of sports in America can easily be
seen in the 26 millionaires listed in
the “I984 World Almanac" under
the title “Estimated Earnings of Ath-
letes.” This book notes that over
45.5 million people attended
National League baseball games in
1983, not unrelated to financial con-
siderations in athletics.

It is no wonder, then, that author
Neil D. Isaacs in his book “Jock Cul-
ture, USA” says, “The athlete is the
high-priced whore of our society.”
Isaacs goes on to say, “The society as
a whole conspires to maintain the
system of exploitation while it
rationalizes away any sense of being
exploiters in the false perception
that successful athletes are far from
exploited.” ,

Isaacs is discussing the role of
sports in the entertainment world in
the chapter of his book entitled “Ten
Cents A Dance.” He analyzed the
various roles of sports in society,
noting that the sporting world is
largly geared toward making money
and that those in control tend not to
concern themselves with issues of
equity but instead continue the tra-
ditions of racism and sexism seem-
ingly inherent in sports.

In football, for example, how
often do you see a black center or
quarterback? Isaac notes that these
positions, as well as the guard posi-
tion, are “too close to the ball.’’. Isaac
quoted David DuPree, "then
sportswriter for the Washington

The Pitt News, Monday, April 15, 1985

Post, on a story from his time at the
University of Washington in Seattle:
“When this outstanding high school
quarterback  walked on the ﬁeld,
he was the No. I quarterback, but
when they saw him without his
helmet, he became the third-string
defensive back.”

Or how about the National Colle-
giate Athletic Association’s intense
battles against the U.S. Constitution
over Title IX of the Education
Amendments of I972 and subse-
quent takeover of women’s intercol-
legiate athletics from the
woman—run Association for Inter-
collegiate Athletics for Women?
Questions dealing with the sexuality
of “female jocks” still persist due to
the masculine characteristics of

sports idolized throughout our
society: faster, further, higher,
stronger — not to mention more

knockouts, more penalty minutes,
more “pancaked” quarterbacks.

Anything as omnipresent as
sports in our culture is bound to
have its problems, its critics. It is not
a solely American phenomenon; our
neighbors to the north, the Canadi-
ans, also play the money game. Can-
ada gaveover $30 million a year to
sports associations around the
world of the Montreal Olympics,
according to Kenneth Dyer in
“Challenging the Men.” The United
Kingdom gave $25 million and Aus-
tria spent $60 million per year, des-
pite its population of only eight
million.

It is not only the professionals and
the political amateurs who become
involved in the economics of athlet-
ics. One need only glance at the
offerings of major football bowls
such as the Cotton Bowl and the
Orange Bowl, each of which offers at

_ which

least $1 million to the winning team.

Participants in an activity that
had its humble beginnings as leisure-
ly pastime have succumbed quite
willingly to the dangling carrot
offered by freewl1epljI;g....owners,
governments and so-called institu-
tions of higher education. Where has
the fun of it gone?

Jean-Marie Brohm adheres to a
Marxist doctrine in analyzing the
role of sports in Western society.
“The scope of the sports pheno-
menon is due above all to the satura-
tion of the mass media with the
sports spectacle  The gigantic scale
of sports events aids the process of
reducing the population to a servile
mass. Throughout the year, the
hearts and minds of the masses are
assaulted with sports contests of
every shape and form which are then
reported in inimitable ideological
style in the major newspapers and on
TV. In this way, sports provide a
smokescreen, diverting people from
their real problems.”

That the sports arena represents
top dollar in‘ the entertainment
world cannot seriously be ques-
tioned. This aspect of the labor force
includes oft-scrutinized, limelit
heros, and they can rest assured that
their lofty status is not likely to
change in the near future. For those
who choose not to become involved
in the all-consuming world of
athletic commercialism, there are
sandlots and backyards where fun is
still the name of the game. Those
parents with thoughts of churning
out a Pete Rose or a Mary Lou Ret-
ton should be wary of the world into
they are sending your
children.

It’s a
act.
