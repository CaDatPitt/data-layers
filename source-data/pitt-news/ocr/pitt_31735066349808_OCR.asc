Vol. 70, No. 8?“?

BY BILL MOORE

The present power of campus
police ofﬁcers, and whether that
power should be increased or
diminished, was discussed by
about 30 participants at yesterday's
open meetings of the Chancellor's
ad hoc task force on campus
security.

Campus Police Officer Roland
Hopewell complained to the task
force of a lack of clear guidelines on
jagice powers and duties. ‘‘I think
i:--.‘) of us feel our job is to serve the
University community, and we
have served well,” Hopewell said.

“But I think we are being used
as pawns. We are put out there as
policemen, and whatever we run
into, _the problem is ours. We don't
have the backing from the top.”

Only one of the numerous blacks
present at the afternoon meeting
related examples of alleged haras-
ment by ofﬁcers, although a large
group of black leaders charged
some of the Pitt police with racist
acts at a press conference two

weeks ago.

A A black, former student said he
had been arrested in his dorm "room
for alleged drug possession, and
possession of stolen property. He
said the police ofﬁcer making the
arrest treated him roughly, until

A dissatisﬁed student interrup-
ted a Student Government Board
(SGB) meeting Tuesday and voiced
his objections to the remunerations
plan approved earlier this week by
Dan Meloro, director of student
activities.

Chuck O'Neill of urban studies
told the SGB he plans to form a
student group to try to halt
payments for student leaders.

‘‘I have not run into one student
not receiving remunerations who
believes Pitt student leaders should
be salaried,” O'Neill said.

The approved remunerations
plan allocating $15,000 of student

'1,-activity fee revenue to 25 student
‘ leaders was drafted this spring by

student representatives from the
School of General Studies, the SGB
and Dave Tive, assistant director of
student activities.

“Student money should not be
used to ﬁnance other student
salaries," O'Neill said “The
students in mass didn't even have a
vote on this proposal.”

O'Neill added that remunera-
tions undermines the spirit of
volunteerism at Pitt. Receiving
salaries may make student leaders
feel professional-and aloof from the

gqudent body, he said_.

he believed his arrest was ' a

were dropped eventually by cam-

Black Action, Society co-chairper-
son Doug Guy mentioned problems
between black fraternities and
campus police. Guy, also a member
of the task force, called for better
communication between black stu-

Police lieutenant Joseph Walker
said he had never heard a clear-cut
deﬁnition of his powers. “I don't
think anybody knows. The question
is always shied away from,"
Walker said.

Officers complained of uncer-

Ofﬁcer Paul Marraway used the
example of a purse snatching to
illustrate his complaint. “If a

Hockey Funds, Spring

Concert Plan. Approved

BY DEANNA LOUISE

During the first of a long series
of allocations ‘hearings Tuesday
evening, the Student Government
Board (SGB) approved an Alloca-
tions Committee recommendation
for SGB funding of half the Hockey
Club's total operating budget.

After talking to Vice Chancellor
for Public Affairs Bernard J.
Kobosky, SGB President Barry
Weisband said he is optimistic that
the club might receive some funds
from the Senate Athletic Commit-
tee. and other sources to ﬁnance the
remaining 55% of the budget.

The motion to fund half the
budget with approximately $8,000
allocations money from student
activities-fee revenue was passed
4-3. -

Before the SGB accepted this
proposal, it’ considered cutting the
club's budget to 25%.

According to SGB member Larry
Krain, “The club should be able to
operate with less funding.”

“Requiring the club to raise
funds," said _SGB member Larry
Gleason, “will help them grow and
put pressure on the athletic
department to take over the club.”

During the allocations appeal
process of past weeks, a club
spokesman told the Board the
Hockey Club had been told not to
expect to be made a varsity sport
before the construction of a new

Motor Code Goes ToHouse  

BY‘ DEANNA LOUISE

Pennsylvania -is the 49th state to
revise its motor code in compliance
with~national statutes set by the
federal Uniform Vehicle Code.

According to John Patterson,
editor of the AAA Motorist,
Pennsylvania's old code is
“straight out of the horse and
buggy era." . -

Patterson estimated 15% of the
Pennsylvania code is being chang-
ed in the bill presently under
congressional scrutiny.

The code passed the Senate last
week but was not voted on in the
House because of several contro-
versial sections. .

A joint conference committee
ironed out some of those problems
and the House ratified the measure
Tuesday by a vote of 157 to 38.

The Senate is expected to vote on
thebill again early next week.

The AAA, said Patterson, feels
the House-approved amnesty plan
is unfair to those drivers who
haven't accumulated many viola-
tion points. i

Under amnesty, all license
suspensions and violation points
presently on the record will be
eradicated. Points accumulated

he would not be penalized for
them.

Patterson said the new point
system substantiates the amnesty

clause because the number of .

points assigned to violations in the
conferees' version of the bill is
smaller than in the past.

Legislators received many write-
ins requesting the_ points be wiped
off the record. This helped the
approval of the clause by the house
Patterson said.

The AAA was generally pleased
with the conferees exclusion of the
“bread and butter” clause, Patter-
son said. The teamsters supported
it.

These limited licenses would
have permitted those drivers whose
licenses had been suspended, but
who drive for a living, to drive.

Defending the truckers, Sen.
Joseph Smith, D-Philadelphia,
said, “Truck drivers are not the
villains on the highway. The safe
drivers are being penalized." He
said only two percent of all
accidents in Pennsylvania are
caused by truckers.

Overall, the AAA approved the
conferees’ ‘rewrite of the motor
code. They supported removal of

“The damage done to the roads
overwhelms the safety beneﬁt of
studded tires," Patterson said. He
said the state might be hard put for
road funding if it didn’t comply to
this statute of the federal uniform

code."
The AAA, however, objected to

two provisions of the code. It felt
the suspensions for drunk drivers
‘should nothave been reduced from
one year t six months.

In other action at the meeting,_
Board approval of the allocations
committee recommendation for the
SGB Programming Committee
budget spurred criticism from both
the Black Action Society (BAS) and
the Programming Committee.
Earlier this month, both BAS and
the Programming Committee ap-

pealed the committee’s recom-.

mendation to put money for both
Black Week and spring concerts
into the Programming budget. A I

BAS would choose the group for
the Black Week Concert and
Programming would be responsible
for the technical procedures.
According to the recommendation,
BAS and Programming would
co-produce the spring concert.

In an appeal to this proposal,
BAS and Programming stated their
unwillingness to work together on
the projects. ' _

“lf BAS wants to choose the
group for the Black Week concert
put the money into their budget,”
said Programming spokesman Bill
Lurye. “Putting the money in‘

Programming's budget, but having "I .
the BAS choose the group can only ..

be substantiated for segregation
reasons.”

An Allocations Committee
statement explained “-joint pro-
gramming will eliminate duplica-
tion of .effort, i.e. -having two major
concerts at the same time.”

Allocations Committee members , .A
insisted their recommendation to 
include the Black_ Week concert in  i

the Programming budget would

save funds. . ,
BAS spokesman Carl Redwood

point_ed out that both groups"

objected to the proposal and were. .

not willing to work together, their
willingness being a prerequisite set.

Oddly enough, the instructor,

BSA/cutching? Needlework Talk

Needleworkers come from varied
social classes and ethnic back-
grounds. “One day I gave a lecture
on needlework history to some
female steel mill workers. The
next, I lectured to wives of the mill
owners.”

Needleworkers, she insists, can-
not be stereotyped, but admits
Americans often label needle-
workers “Susie homemakers.”
This undermines the value of their
work.

“Needlework is undervalued
enough,”.she said.

Maines said there's a market for
needlework—quilts, needlepoint,
embroidery—if the artist is willing
to sell the work for less than its
worth. Often labor is valued at only
20 cents an hour or less. “People
aren't willing to pay for needlework
like they’re willing to pay for
paintings or sculpture.”

It follows that needleworkers
seldom receive the recognition
other artists receive. This is one
reason Maines founded the Center
Needlework (CHAN), a combina-
tion showplace, library and re-
source center celebrating its grand
opening next Sunday and Monday,
Flag Day (the.official needlework
day). "

The only one of its kind in the
United States, the center is located
at 2216 Murray Avenue in Squirrel
Hill.

Soon after the center was moved
from Maines’ home, where all its
resources were stored in a
nine-by-eleven foot room, to the
store front in Squirrel Hill, a pipe
burst, leaving Maines ankle deep
in water. Fortunately, only one

piece, a crazy quilt, was ruined by ‘

the small ﬂood.

The center will be ready to open
its .doors to the public this
weekend, despite this setback.
Visitors are welcome to browse,
borrow reference books or ask
questions. CHAN, in fact, serves
as the main resource center for

students taking the fine arts
course.
Perhaps the most rewarding

aspect of the center for Maines is
the recognition it gives to those
needleworkers who have reached
the top of their profession. Name
one famous needleworker other
than Betsy Ross. Huh? There are
others. Sas Colby, Helen Bitar,
Erika Wilson and Mariska Caracxz
are some of the needlework greats,
but CHAN is their only claim to‘
fame. «

In fact, Mariska Caracz revolu-
tioned the art. _ She started the
trend in creative stitchery that until
the '60s was all but unknown.
Before Caracsz stepped into the
scene. people assigned only useful-
ness values to stitchery——pothold-
ers, aprons, coverlets. purses.
Wall hangings wer unknown.

In the ’50s, said Maines, people
felt ashamed of wearing what were’
referred to as “homemade,” not
“handmade” clothes. Finally, in
the ’70s, people began to analyze
stitchery like any other art. A

Maines’ students learn to inter-
pret the nature of the artist from
his stitchery, which delivers a
"message just like an abstract
painting; amessage about culture,
geography, war, love, or sex.

“Often a particular type of
needlework /gets handed down
through the generations in a
family,” said Maines. “In mine, it
was afghans.”

Police Power

The schizophrenic role of the Pitt campus police officer portrayed at
yesterday's meeting of the task force on campus security is a serious
problem. Example after example of situations where police ofﬁcers
don't know whether to act, or call in city police, were presented at the
public hearings. ‘

Fortunately, when in doubt, campus police ofﬁcers usually act.
Unfortunately, they often are criticized later.

Pitt is far too urban, far too crime-ridden and far too big to get by
with just a security force. Pitt needs a police force, and one as well
trained and efﬁcient as possible. I

 * Pitt, and Pitt students, need round-the-clock protection, both in
buildings and on the sidewalks used to get to those buildings. _
Police ofﬁcers at yesterday’ s meeting were worried that their powers
' would be curtailed. Although no one in an ofﬁcial capacity has
seriously suggested it, that action has been discussed.

the oiticers yesterday, and make serious recommendations to the

Chancellor.

Chancellor Posvar, in turn, should realize the complexity of the
problem and seriousness of the situation, and take steps to end the

Letters to the Editor

 

- The Judge
Of Us All

I greatly respect the right of each
individual to hold and practice his
or her religious beliefs. When this
practice goes public, however, and
I am called a “sinner,’.’ an “angry,
contentious woman” and a “tom-
boy” by George Smock because I
don't happen to accept his
particular religious views, then that
respect goes.

In the June 8 issue of the Pitt

_ News writer Bill Moore states that

Smock’s hecklers are “cruel.” I
disagree. We were being publicly
insulted and returned the favor.

"Why should we leave the Cathedral
lawn just because a self-proclaimed
preacher. wants to give loud vent to
his sexist views? Why should we
keep quiet when we disagree with
him? He's speaking voluntarily,
and if he doesn't like the reception,
let him leave—after all, he has no
connection with the Pitt communi-
ty, while the students who like to
i use the lawn certainly do.

I will readily admit that my
‘comments were loud, abusive,

I'm concerned, the sexist view that
Smock was presenting of “wo-

What a disgusting example of
hypocrisy! I always thought that
Jesus preached love, while this
clown, supposedly a follower of
Jesus, was full of nothing but anger
and violence. My actions may have
been wrong, but at least I wasn't
trying to present myself as a
Crhistian through words while my
actions said just the opposite.

In some eyes I may be at fault
since I heckled Smock, but my
disagreement was strictly verbal,

subjected to. I don't blame Smock,
though his presence was certainly
an indirect cause. I'm sure he was

Unable
To Listen

In reference to the “Behind the
Lines” of June 8, 1976, I agree that
the crowd was heckling Mr. Smock,
and that every man has the right to
speak his mind. but, Mr. Smock,
for all the Christianity he professes
to have within himself, is unable to
listen to another person. I always
thought one of the main doctrines
of Christianity was love for a fellow
human being. It seems reasonable

that if this self-ordained evangelist ‘

wanted to get people interested in
his_religion he would be able to
listen and intelligently discuss the
Bible. I cannot seriously take a
man, who, when challenged, jumps
around more, talks ten decibles
louder and quotes a large amount
of Scripture.

He failed to show he cared about
his fellow man by his keeping his
distance from the crowd and
refusing to take on their chal-
lenges.

According to many of those who
witnessed Smock’s performance on

the north lawn of the Cathedral this '

week, their right to a peaceful
afternoon comes before Smock’s
right to speak. Especially, they
add, when he spouts such
inﬂammatory rhetoric.

“It’s a sensitive issue,” one of
those who witnessed, and was
upset by, Smock’s preaching said.
“You"’ve got to strike a balance
between his right to speak, and our
right not to hear it. This is
sensitive stuff he is talking about.”

In short, they were there first,
Smock came, was rude, and they
were rude in return. He started it,
he asked for it and he deserved it.

What’s it all mean? Among
other things, I was wrong. Or at

were shut off from the computer

of the story, with Count Basie as

nutritional diet, the concert was
deﬁnitely an event. Maybe Heinz
Hall, with its baroque decor and
gold-painted columns, wasn’t the
right place. I would’ve felt more at
home in a dance hall than a
cramped concert seat.

But it wasn’t Heinz Hall that was
the problem. While pianist Oscar
Peterson and guitarist Joe Pass are
marvelous technicians and can
probably play a faster run of notes
than any other living human, their
overall performances lacked a
warm feeling. And I’m a human
being first and a music lover
second.

Yeah, Peterson did “Caravan”
and got some of the crowd to its
feet when‘ he left the stage,,but his
boogie woogie and stride piano riffs
were his most satisfying. He almost
seemed to be challenging the
audience to stay with him. Pass’
opening numbers were swaying,
Spanish-ﬂavored tunes‘, but when
he followed with unmelodic rifﬁng,
[knew it was time to catch a smoke
out in the lobby (where you can't
miss a lick because of the speaker
system). I guess it was a response
to the audience's wants and needs,
but it makes me wonder where
peoples’ heads are these days.

Before intermission, pianist Ba-
sieijoined Peterson on the stage
with his ‘acoustic bass man and
drummer, but Peterson, while
being polite to his dueling piano
partner, couldn’t get Basie to
cooperate. Basie’s body language
and lack of playing testiﬁed to that.-

But when Basie took the stage
with full compliment of trumpets,
saxes, trombones and three-man
rhythm section, the melody came
back to the music. It was more

We are sitting in on an ordinary

“Big Mother,” a play based on the

Besides, everyone is having fun.
The four character are having a ball

human endurance. And once past

is as riotous as they could want.

Jan cso's ,“Recl Psalm"
Art On The Screen

BY SAM CHOI

In the past, ﬁlm was considered
a simple recorder of events, as
opposed to an artistic process.

Today, though, cinema is becoming

more an artistic expression—an
'art on screen’—posing the same
technical challenges for its creators
that of canvas works.

This development takes the ﬁlm
viewer out of the easy chair of
passive watching; it demands
active involvement from the audi-
ence, an intellectual awareness of
frame composition, and
stylethat up to now was reserved
for still-life works in art galleries.

This shift is partly realized in the
physical activity of the camera. The
story or narrative of the film
becomes, secondary: the emphasis
is placed on active camera work
presenting time-evading experi-
ences of lush colors and graceful
movements.

Miklos Janeso in his Red Psalm
explores the possibilities of expres-
sion in formal and stylistic

metaphors, and the exhilaration of
In this way we the"

movement.

Comprised largely of poor peas-
ants, the movement was dedicated
to removing the last remnants of
feudalism.

As always, Jancso explores his
subject obliquely; instead of a
realistic historical account.,
creates a folk tale, an allegory, a
ritualistic portrayal of revolution
that takes on a universal feeling
and signiﬁcance.

The ﬁlm takes place entirely on a

../-,3

large plain that is filled, alternate-?5__e"-II/,_~

ly, with the heroic peasants and
their enemies: soldiers, police,
priests, landowners. The peasants
make demands and are threatened,
leading to their own rebellion and
the ensuing seesaw battles.

Jancso employs his distinctive
long takes (there are only 26
distinct shots in the ﬁlm), with the
camera moving endlessly. Back
and forth, around and among
groups of people, zooming into
faces, shifting attention suddenly
to others—-this camera technique
conveys the feeling almost of

audience are allowed to explore
and become the co-stars of the
perceived work, rather than only its
receptacle.

The setting is Hungary in the
1890s, which saw the emergency of
agrarian socialist movements.

A Brawling Affair A

receive the deserving humiliating
attention), then Sweetums must be
constipated—a situation quickly to
be remedied with the hated enema
bag. Etc. Etc. Space does not allow
for further enumerations. Besides,
you should see the play. But the
question remains: who are the
adults. in this unit anyway? Big
Mother wants a nurse...a maid,...a
nursemaid, to help her cope with
the situation. A

It is in a compelling moment that
Cub Scout Buster takes his sister
by"the hand and leads her out of the
room of hysteria. He returns only to
dash his hat across the room as an
expression of contempt and rejec-
tion of the environment. Unfortu-
nately, the action does not follow
logically. It is unconvincing for a
faithful cohort of these escapades
to open his eyes and realize the pits
he must escape from.

Unfortunate, because we know
that doesn’t happen so easily in
real life. And this play being a
caricature of real life, that does
leave us in a dilly.

Schinkel to
Return as
Pen Coach  

MONTREAL (AP)-~The Pitts-
-burgh Penguins announced yester-
day that Ken Schinkel will return
next year as coach of the National
Hockey League club.

“We are very happy with the job
done by Schinkel,” said Penguip
General Manager Wren Blair, who
is in ‘ Montreal attending NHL
meetings.

“And although he tookﬁthe job
reluctantly at the time, he has

developed a‘ strong feeling about‘

continuing on as coach.” _

‘Schinkel, a former Penguin
player. took over the team in the
middle of the 1975-76 season and
compiled a 20-10-17 record the rest
of the way.‘ Pittsburgh ﬁnished in
third place in the NHL’s Norris
division. but was eliminated in the
first round of the Stanley Cup
playoffs.

It was Schinkel's second stint as
coach. In February 1974, he was
named to replace Red Kelly, who
was tired. Schinkel himself was
replaced in the middle of the
following season by Marc Boileau.

Schinkel. who had been serving
as director of player personnel.
returned as coach when Boileau

expected to sign the deal within
two weeks, his attorney Alan
Eagleson, announced.

Though terms of the pact were
not revealed, Eagleson said the
multiyear agreement would include
“no deferred compensation. It’s
cash on the barrelhead.” There
have been published reports the
Chicago offer was worth $3 million
for ﬁve years.

Eagleson’s use of the phrase
“deferred compensation” referred

exclusively to Chicago’s payment

to Orr. Compensation still must be
agreed upon by the Black Hawks
and Boston Bruins, the club with
which Orr broke into the league in
the 1966-67 season and from which
he became free June 1. '

Pitt guard-forward Keith Starr
was taken by the NBA Chicago
Bulls in the fourth round of
Tuesday’s professional‘ basketball
draft. Starr, who was sidelined" all
but two minutes of the past season
with an injured knee, was the 57th
player selected. g

In his junior year two seasons
ago, Starr averaged more than 13
points per game and set a Panther
single-season assist record. Starr
has one more year of college
eligibility left, but will pass up
another year in the Blue and Gold
should the Bulls offer him a no~cut

, contract. He cannot hire an agent,

however, if he wants to remain
eligible for a redshirt and another
year of college ball.

“I won't go unless I get a

no-cut, ” Starr said. “I want
security. Security is the main
thing‘. ”

Jerry Krause, Chicago’s director

of player personnel, said last night
that any. discussion of contract
terms was premature. Negotia-
tions, according to Krause, will
depend upon many things, particu-
larlv the condition of Starr’s knee.

PITT CYCLIST
MISSES OLYMPICS

William Martin, a senior
economics major, competed in ‘the
Olympic Trials in bicycling this
week at Saranac Lake, New York,
but failed to qualify for a spot on
the Olympic team.

Martin, who has lettered twice
on the Pitt swim team and has been
competing in bicycle races for
about a year, faced competition
from the top 60 cyclists in the
country for a position on the team.

“If his knee becomes 100%, at
that time we’ll talk to him. Right
now, it’s not 100%,” Krause said.
“When his knee is ﬁne, then we'll
discuss things with him.”

If Starr decides to remain at Pitt
and play another year of college
ball, he may enhance his prospects
for next year’s draft. “If I go to
school next year and have a good
season, I may come out as a higher
draft choice and get more money,"
he said.

According to Starr, however,
money will not be the major factor
in his decision to sign with the
Bulls or stay at Pitt. “Money is

Next came saxophonist Turrentine. He won the crowd over to his
side with two things; a smooth set of ﬁery jazz, and the announcement

of his Pittsburgh roots.

Turrentine is a master musician. He proved that on “Pieces of
Dreams” and “Hope We Can Be Together Soon.”. But just because
the dude’s from Pittsburgh doesn’t mean he should get a standing
ovation for everything he does. Unwarranted applause is boring.

Food
For Thought

BY MICHELE BASKIND

The Studio ‘Theatre provided
‘food for thought’ in yesterday’s
lunchtime matinee of “The Real
Inspector Hound.” ‘

Entering the theatre, I chose a
cream cheese and olive sandwich
(there was a choice of peanut butter
and honey for the fun-loving,
cream-cheese and olives for the
classic and braunschweiger and
cheese for the bold.) So there we
sat, munching on sandwiches and
crispy salads, when the lights
dimmed and the action began.

‘Real Inspector’ was another
whodunit, action-packed, mystery
suspense drama and its theme was
based on the perennial question,
“Who was the cagey, ‘unknown
murderer?” The play, however,
unlike others of this sort, had a
curious twist to it. Two of the
characters, who were playing
drama critics and discussing the
play, eventually became innocently
involved in the unsolved murder.
The result is funny as the
bewildered critics stumble about,
trying to find a clue to their strange
predicament.

The characters fit into their roles
with ease. Inspector Hound, by the
way, the real Inspector Hound, is a
typical bumbling fool; a Peter
Sellers type.

day, Wednesday and Friday at

Light And Lively
Vignettes On Love

BY KATHY KIELY

“Hello Stranger,” which opened
at the Studio Theatre in the
Cathedral basement Tuesday, is
ambitious and exuberant. The
production utilizes the diverse
talents of all the company
members, talents that range
beyond acting—from writing to
singing, to dancing and costuming.

The theme is love, the play, a
medley of skits and songs.

The theme that unites the
disparate elements of the play is
fairly obvious throughout, but it is
never explicitly articulated until the
closing song. “Kiss today goodbye
and point me to tomorrow,”
members of the cast chorus,
explaining that they “won’t forget,
can’t regret what I did for love.”

Such bravado is intriguing, and it
provides" the critic’s cue.
“Hello Stranger” is inconsistent.
While most of the skits give love
the comic treatment that seems to
be recommended in the play’s
ﬁnale, a few are embarassingly
maudlin. The old vaudeville
blackout technique provides
neither the time nor the mood for
the development and resolution of
serious romantic conﬂicts. Conse-
quently, the dramatic scenes seem
awkward.

The company is at its best in
comic, or tragicomic vignettes
about love’s disappointments. One

One gets the idea that the

justify all the fun they were having
