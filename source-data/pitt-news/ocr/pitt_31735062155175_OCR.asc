Main Theme at .

Hunt, Pineliooms Ready

Official opening of the Pitt Union has been tentatively
set for 2 p.m. on the ﬁrst day of classes, Sept. 24. Limited
food facilities will be available for students at that time.

Furnishings of the former Hunt and Pine Rooms of the
Schenley will be almost unchanged. Soft drinks, sandwiches,
coffee, and other light foods will be served.

Dr. Charles H. Peake, assistant chancellor in charge of
student activities, said that the rooms will be in no way a
substitute for a cafeteria but will be a setting for “sociable
conversation.” , l

A cafeteria and other more extensive food facilities
will eventually be provided in 6
the Union.
The entire plans for all fa-
cilities of the Union will be
announced in greater detail
about the ﬁrst week of classes.
Clapp Hall will also be opened
for Freshman Chemistry lab classes
on Sept. 24, according to William
G. Fisher, director of the physical
plant. '
Fisher said that not all of the
laboratories are completed and the
entire building will not be in use
until October.

reported as increased slightly
over last year at this time.

According to the latest re-
port of the Registrar’s Office
dated Aug. 31, freshman ap-
plications have increased "/3 per

dergraduate schools require that
the applicants have certiﬁcates
from their high schools showing
that they are in the upper two-
ﬁfths of their graduating class.

Any applicants in the lower

three-ﬁfths are required to take

college entrance exams.”

“As the tide of applications

Microfilm Aids

Research Work
For University

New avenues for research and
reference work are open to stu-
dents at the University of Pitts-
burgh through the medium of
microfilm, which has made avail-

‘ able a large collection of rare

and valuable books and papers
which otherwise would be unob-
tainable.

The microtext method of pre-
serving and copying books and
manuscripts, now widely used,

’ has enabled the University to add

‘to its library items which are
rare and expensive in the ori-
ginal form. In some cases there
is only one copy in existence.

Microtext, relatively an in-
novation in libraries in the
United States, has been used ex.-
tensively at Pitt since 1945. One
of the ﬁrst schools in the coun-
try to experiment with ﬁlmed
publications, Pitt boasts a large
and growing collection of books,
valuable papers and periodicals
available through the microﬁlm
process.

In addition to old and rare
documents, microfilm can be
used to film abstracts and dis-
sertations by graduate students
for distribution among universi-
ties..'

“Era of Change” Theme

At Government Retreat

Continued from Page 1
mission members suggested that
freshman men and women take
their customs’ test together, at-
tend customs’ sings together, and
work on a vocational guidance
program together.

Levels Raised
“A student body with better

quality of minds to promote dis-
cussion," Dean Rush predicted will
result from the high academic
standards of the University. Com-
mission discussed the idea that
since classrooms will be ﬁlled with
students from only the upper ﬁfths
of their high school classes, stand-

ards of grading, tests, and lectures

will be raised.

As a _result of these new
standards, Assistant Dean of
Women Savina Skewis said,
women applicants for this Fall
semester were so numerous that
a serious housing problem de-
veloped and made it necessary
to turn. down applicants.

Most of Commission agreed with
Chris Taylor, Col. ’58, that “Some
women need a push into Pitt life,
and we must spread more interest
and enthusiasm for such important
events as faculty talks out of class

and football rallies . . . ” _

“Panther pins will be given to
the freshman women," Customs
Committee ch airm an Ruthann
Sturges reported.

On Wednesday night of the re-
treat, former University Chancellor
John Bowman spoke to Commis-
sion about his early life and his

experiences in the construction of

the Cathedral.

Retreat meetings, held in a
cabin near the White Sulphur
Springs Hotel, were broken up by
swimming "in a spring lake, moun-
tain hikes, a picnic, and song-
feted meals.

On The Bandwagon

A large number of new students will be enrolled in
the University this week and to these people we extendla
hearty welcome. Those of us who have been here a while
can guarantee these new students times of discouragement
and anguish, but along with these, they will, no doubt,
experience countless moments of enjoyment and satisfac-
tion. ‘

I, ~

This last emotion———satisfaction——is one that we are pri-
marily interested in at the start. Perhaps it will reach the

. new student in the form of a paper well done or a chair-

manship carried out effectively. All well and good. But we
hope at the. same time that the newcomers will capture
still another kind of satisfaction—that of witnessing a new
phase of development in a great University.

A feeling of pride and enthusiasm has been strongly
developed here and the reasons are obvious. To use a

familiar expression, “we are in a tremendous period of ex-- 0
. pansion.” In the engineering school a new E&M building

has been opened. Additions to the Medical School and
School of Pharmacy will follow. National prominence has
been given to a University of Pittsburgh scientist, Dr. Jonas
E. Salk, and more scholarships have been awarded to
students wishing to study abroad during the _summer.

Socially speaking, plans have been made for a modern
student union that will include among other things, game
rooms, lounges, and new oﬁices for student activities, while
facing the Union will be seven remodeled apartments to
ﬁll the critical dormitory need. _

Sports has not been left out of the rosy picture as
proven by our Sugar Bowl” football team and eastern cham-
pionships in swimming and wrestling.

There are, of course, numerous other developments not
mentioned here. The point of the matter is, however, that
the new underclassmen, as well as the old, are indeed fortu-

~ nate to be able to participate in the program themselves.

If, while participating, the incoming students are aware of
the signiﬁcance of this expansion and can carry this aware-
ness into those meetings where student work and opinion
is needed, then both the students and University will beneﬁt.
It is a goal worth striving for. -

Nasser Against Diplomacy, imperialism . . .

Costly Cairo Capers

By Irv Rofhmon

The Constantinople Convention of 1888 assured
peaceful nations economic security in the use of
the Suez Canal. Operation of the canal has thus
existed under the terms of the Convention and has
been supported by the Britain-French Suez Canal
Company—until recent months.

While Great Britain controlled the Middle East,
it was vital that it operate the ,
canal. Neither France nor the 1
United States had ever to fear 5
that such operation would hinder 
their economic machinations.

But the removal of British
power from the Middle East and
the dependence of allies on Mid-
dle East were both a result of
and the cause of widespread na-
tionalism. When Egypt’s dictator -
Nasser “nationalized” the Canal he realized the im-
pact of both these points; supported by Russian
propaganda, not funds, the dictator utilized his
resources to realize the Suez Canal wholly for the
Cairo government.

No Violation

It is necessary to realize, however, that in na-
tionalizing the canal Nasser did not violate the Con-
stantinople Convention other than it has been vio-
lated under the Suez Canal Company. He did not
stop shipping or prevent commercial operation
through the Canal except to bar Israeli ships. This
has been Canal policy since 1948; Egypt considers
itself at war with Israel despite the armistice.

Egypt's seizure, therefore, is tantamount to the
dependence of India and nationalization of the oil
-industry throughout Middle Eastern countries; the
Canal is in Egyptian territory. For European coun-
tries to claim it for their own might well be termed
colonialism. For any European company to re-
claim it by force might well be mnsidered im-
perialism. 0

Either term is a.watchword of Arab nationalism.

Conol for Egypt
By freezing the Canal Company’s assets in Egypt

and by assuming its obligation, the Nasser govern-

ment, hdwever, causes no small concern among
world powers——not because Egypt is unentitled to
control of the Canal; it is. The Suez Canal Com-
pany was to turn over operation of the Canal to

Friendships and Cabbage . . .

 

Egypt within the next twenty years under mgatual
agreement.

The _facts that such action was taken on an
emotional basis, that diplomatic channels were ne-
glected, that individual rights were ignored, that
part commitments proved irreleva,nt-——these items
are of concern.

Nasser has not violated the Constantinople Con-
vention; until he does no coercive action may be
taken to enforce nation’s rights. To assume that
he will violate the doctrine is unfair. We can only
wait.

Economic Responsibility
However, Nasser has violated principles of eco-

nomic morality. His plea to‘ Arab Nationalismtakes ’

little note of economic responsibility.

The world’s diplomacy, its whole economic ﬁber
would collapse were international agreements sub-
ject to the whims of such individuals as Nasser or
irresponsible governments.

International diplomacy, not immediately ob-
vious canal seizure, is the major question at hand
in the current crisis.

If the Nasser government is to eventually re-
lent, it will not be as a result of coercion from
Western Powers battleships or tri-nation associa-
tions. War is obviously not the answer. But in
the future Nasser’s ability to raise credit for Egyp-
tian progress through international circles will be.

seriously impaired because of’ his refusal to com-5*

ply with diplomatic agreements. Nasser may win‘

an emotional victory from nationalization of the
canal but will earn a bitter defeat in the ﬁnal
estimate. ' I

Cautions Nosser . 5’,
Premier Nasser must surely be’ cognijant of
these implications. He is proceeding imére cau-

New terms must be written for the operation

of the Canal to the satisfaction of all countries us-

ing the important trade route. .In 1888 a special
convention was called to deliberate upon the mat-
ter.
vehicle for settling international disputes.

crisis; for the ultimate solution must be reached
through diplomatic channels, not by means of hasty

from women’s classes and activi-
ties. And little had we known
each other outside of classes and
formal meetings.

 

Then we?"began in.troduc.ing '

ourselves as personalities with
interests outside of college life.

“As for my summer vacation,”
someone said, “it had its ups and
downs . . . I ran an elevator at
the Schenley Hotel.”

“Nurses do only one thing in
the summer,” said a student of
that group, “and that’s what they
do in the winter.”

One of the 35 of us confessed
that she “demonstrated a sliding
board in a department store this
summer.”

Somebody said she worked for
her father’s cleaning company.
“And, with~a sordid frown she
added, ‘‘If you ever worked 'for
your father, you know how it is.”

“Ce n’est pas possible de parler
de touten dans une fois” at ﬁrst
from that world traveler. But
later she and Fran Hedges prac-
tically talked our heads off.

By. the time 2:30 p.m. and ser-
ious discussion came around, we
were talking and laughing easily
and sincerely. We spoke of the
changes at Pitt. I like to remem-
ber especially Carol Fine’s‘ re-
mark that the trick is to ‘ride
the waves of change, not ﬁght

.them, but not fear them.”

Soon came the subject of the
continuation of women's activity
on the twelfth ﬂoor.

No matter how lacking in
opinions we might have been on
other matters, I believe each of
the 35 or so of us had an opinion
here. And these opinions seemed,

to me, to lie in two distinctly A

different ﬁelds. _

One train of thought followed
the lines of a strong personal
attachment to the activities, fa-
cilities and ideals connected with
the twelfth floor. It is difficult to
describe the depth of feeling in
the people of this opinion. Per-

whaps it’s the manifestation of the

women’s need for a home econ-
omics department at Pitt. ..Maybe
it’s just the need for a home-
away from home.

The twelfth floor is Pitt’s home

men or women, are ever welcome
to come up and help cook, or

thought. It is also, I believe, the
manifestation by the women of
a need for a home at school. This
thought is that Pitt women can
meet, discuss problems intimate-
ly, and strengthen friendships
anywhere—be it a palace or a
hut.

For myself, I think both trains
of thought are secondary in im-
port to something else.

not the cabbage that matters. It’s
the teamwork and fun in prepa-

Both trains of thought want to
add to and maintain the happi-

of these thoughts and the primary
unity behind both that I believe
is most important.

Pitt’s 1200 undergraduate wom-

12 credits are members of WSGA.
Elected members from the 1200

At the beginning of the 1956
retreat, conversations were for-

Education System
Of Foreign Country
Compared to Ours

(Editor’s Note: This is the
_‘ first of a series on student trips
to Europe.)

By GORDON CLOVVNEY

Carolyn Loefﬂer came back
to the states after her summer
trip to.Europe with many new
and different experiences to
tell about, but perhaps the
one thing that stood out in her
mind was the difference be-
tween the European and Amer-
ican systems of education.

The recipient of the 1956 Stu-
dent Hostess Award for travel
and study abroad, Carolyn chose
to spend her time studying at the
University of Vienna Summer
School in Austria.

The buildings of the newly re-
modeled summer school are
modern and very comfortable, oc-
cupying a large estate on Lake St.
Wolfgang. However, there were
several amusing incidents which
occured when the American stu-
dents arrived there. As an ex-
ample, said Carolyn, two boys ar-
riving there, went to their room
and discovered that among other
things they were lacking a door
and curtains. They went up to the
office and told the woman there
that their room wasn’t ﬁnished.
She looked calmly at them and
‘asked what time it was “Five
_p.m.”, they told her. “Well,” she

._said, “I” told you seven p.m." And
sure enough, by seven that par-

‘thrular room was completed and

-reaady for students.

Impressed With Students
Carolyn was very favorably

level and conscientious attitude of
her fellow students, approximate-

O

ly eight of whom were Americans.
Ten Austrians and a scattered
few from other countries made
up the rest of the student body.

“The school system in Aus-
tria,” Carolyn said, “seems quite
complicated and is a little con-
fusing in comparison with our
system at home.”

"In Austria, students are re-
quired to attend school until they
are 14 years old, and they have
a variety of choice according to
their individual interest. Every-
one attends four years of Volk-
schule. Then, if a student wishes
only to go to school as long as re-
quired by law, he may go on to
Haupschule for
years. Or, he may go on to Mill-
teschule for another eight years
to prepare him for entering the
university.

Schooling Cheap

Basically, the ﬁrst four years of
Milleschule are the «same as the
four years of Haupschule. Once
a child has ﬁnished Haupschule,
he is prepared to go out and work
as a clerk in shops or to get a
position in industry, though in
most cases he must take further
courses at night, three days a
week, at some commercial school
to ﬁll in his specialized knowl-
edge. Also, from Haupschule, a
student is qualiﬁed to go to what
corresponds to our state teachers’
college, where he becomes quali-
ﬁed to instruct in the lower
grades. There is a requirement of
two years’ practice teaching and
the passing-of certain state tests
before a student is free to begin
teaching. _

University schooling is very
cheap in Austria, as the govern-

ment subsidizes education. If a‘

child shows promise and/ or is
ﬁnancially incapable of payment,
his tuition is free. Teaching in
the University is done in the lee-
ture-seminar style, formal atten-

Pitt’s History of Religion De-
partment, established last fall, is
to be expanded for the coming
school year.

A new course will be added in
Jewish Religion a nd Culture,
taught by Dr. Aharon Kessler,
now head of the Committee on
Jewish Education in Pittsburgh.

Last year the department offered
four courses, in history and liter-
ature of the Old and New Testa-
ments, religions of mankind, his-
tory of religion in American soci-
ety, and biographical studies of
European and American religious
leaders. In the near future these
courses and the new one to be
offered this fall will be augmented
by classes in church history and in
Jewish-Christian ethics.

Until the addition of Dr. Kess- _

ler, the whole history of religions
curriculum was taught by Dr. Ray-
mond F. Brittain, who joined the
Pitt faculty in 1937.

Religion as an academic study
began at Pitt about three years
ago when an interdepartment cur-
riculum was planned for pre-
theology students and others in-
terested in religious education and
church administration.

tours and other excursions.
Before arriving in Austria,
Carolyn, who sailed from Mont-
real in early June, had a chance
to visit the sights in London,
Paris, and Switzerland before ar-
riving in Vienna.
‘Of Austria, she said, “it has

‘all the charm and beauty of

Switzerland without the resort-
like atmosphere of that country.
In addition, the people there are
extremely friendly and always
willing to help.”

QB Lewis Leads Locals

By ED KOLTISKA
Coach John Michelosen is stressing “polish” to his charges
at his two a day practice sessions in getting ready for the
revenge-minded West Virginia Mountaineers at Morgantown

"Saturday. The kickoff is slated for 1:30 EST.

The Panthers just ﬁnished two weeks of rugged scrim-

inaging and running drills, and the Blue and Gold mentor

didn’t waste much time in bumping heads. A scrimmage
was scheduled the second day of practice to give the locals

the East last year, there is a pos-
sibility that they might even be
armed with shot guns as well as

Walton Acclaimed

Twenty - lettermen are vieing
for a starting berth along with 32
others. With only ﬁve more days
of practice, Coach Michelosen has
Joe Walton and Bob Rosborough
running on the ﬁrst team at the
end positions.

In pre-season All American
selections, Walton was chosen on
the ﬁrstteam. Rosborough, after
starting practice a week late, took
over right end after Dale Brown
was sidelined with sore ribs re-
ceived in a scrimmage. All three
were lettermen last season.

Bob Kiesel, Dick Scherer, Jim
Zanos, and Gordon Oliver add
depth to the terminal slots. Kiesel
and Scherer are both nursing
minor injuries received in prac-
tice, but are expected to be avail-
able Saturday.

Panther Win Over Mounties

Could ‘End ’Season

By "Al: PELAEZ

A
V

From time immemorial the average West Virginia hill-
billy has cherished three things. First, his freedom. in the
rugged mountain surroundings; second, his legendary moon-
shine; and. third, victories over. Pitt.

There have been times during the last two years, how-
ever, when every Mountaineer to a man would have for-
saken his freedom and even his corn-squeezings for a touch-
down or two. The 1954 and 1955 West Virginia squads——
the two best teams" in WVU history-—both had their dreams
of an undefeated season shattered by underdog Panther
elevens.’ Last year’s defeat also deprived the Mountaineers

, of a Sugar Bowl bid, and the $150,000 that goes with it.

Even ‘before the ﬁnal
brought last season’s 26-7 Pan-
ther victory to a hectic end, West
Virginia’s board of strategy was

looking forward to this year-—and
the Michelosenmen.

Lewis Experiments

Coach Art Lewis, realizing that
his pre-season hopes had been

would have to

coni and Freddy Wyant.

‘All of these ‘players received
All - American mention -- the
largest representation from a.
single school in several years.
His experimenting‘ paid off,
however, and many think the
Mounties will be even stronger
this season than last.

One of the results of Lewis’ ex—.
perimenting was the ‘discovery”
of Mickey Trimarki. The junior
quarterback from Burgettstown
replaced the, injured Wyant dur-
ing the later part of last season

and proved himself a smart, cap-
able signal caller and an excep-
tional passer.

There Goes Rabbits

Another late season ﬁnd was Bill
Underdonk, a towering senior
tackle. Underdonk has long been
rated one of college football's bet-
ter defensive tackles but could
never win a starting berth with
the Mounties. This year, with both
Bosley and Huff playing pro ball,
Underdonk should prove that only
two All-Americans -could have
prevented him from playing.

The most colorful player on
the ﬁeld for West Virginia each
Saturday is sure to be Jack Rab-
bits, the halfback who’s as elu-
sive as his name implies. Rabbits
is the Mounties most dangerous
break-away threat and is par-
ticularly effective on punt and
kick-off returns. He averaged
8.8 yards per carry last year

/to lead the Lewismen in that de-
partment.

a One position where the Mounties
will deﬁnitely be stronger this sea-
son is fullback, where Larry Krut-
ko is ﬁrmly entrenched. The rug-
ged junior averaged 5.8 yards per
carry last season and is described
by his coaches as “the Nagurski
type runner.” Many close follow-
ers of the Mountaineers consider
Krutko to have as much potential
as ‘Ira Rodgers, WVU’s all time
All-American fullback.

Center, the one weak position

Twice Daily Workoiits Prepare

Bemismen For Tough Season

About 40 soccer hopefuls begin two a day workouts at
Kenard Field today in preparation for one of the toughest
schedules in the country. Morning and afternoon sessions
have been slated until school begins in preparation for a
slate that has Coach Bemis saying, “I think it’s the best

schedule yet.”

We might hasten to add that this is only the third season
of intercollegiate soccer for the Panthers. In the previous
two seasons, they came up withspectacular 8-1 and 8-4

records despite the shortage

of experienced booters while

playing some of the best in the East and South.

Although the Jungle Cat men- 9

tor ‘has lost only two -ﬁrst string-
ers in Bob ‘ Cherry and Norm
Zanardelli, he has openly de-
clared that ‘fall the positions
are wide open. and each candi-
date will have to earn his start-
ing berth.” hi " , S.
Then Bemis: added that “we
would like -to see as many boys
trying out fo_r,~the team as -pos-
sible.”_ .._. . .
Another thing Bemis emphasiz-
ed which shouldn’t be overlooked
is although there are only two
holes to fill because of graduation,
there has been a heavy loss of
reserves which has taken away
much of the necessary depth so
vital to a winner.

In Zanardelli the Blue and
Gold lost one of its top defensive
stars while in Cherry it lost a
player who was the outstanding
scorer of last year’s team.
Cherry seemed to have the knack
of coming up with a timely goal
when it was needed, and will be

the hardest man to replace.

The ﬁrst test for the Bemismen
will come Oct. 6 when they clash
with Slippery Rock on the latter’s
ﬁeld.

Other features attractions will
be with Army and Navy who are
both strong. And right next door
in neighboring Ohio the locals
will have to boot with the Ohio
State Buckeyes.

Adding insult to injury, the
Jungle Cats will also have to do
battle with Penn State and
Brockport, New York. These
two teams are the co-national
champions.

In Dixie they run into the top
outﬁt of the deep South in the
Wolfpack of North Carolina State
which defeated them last year by
a 2-1 margin.

Thus, with this murderous
schedule it’s hard to see how J. P.
Graham, Paul Griffiths, Sammy
Hazou & Company can improve
on the 8-4 chart of a year ago,
but maybe they can,

The 1956 Mounties, although
lacking the great number of in-
dividual stars that abounded on
the Moi-gantown campus for the
last four years, should be al-
most as good a. team. They have
both power and speed and in
Trimarki, a better. than average

ches will be their lack of ex-
perienced ends to snare Tri-

West Virginians have always
had the habit of waiting until after
the Pitt game before deciding
whether the season has been a
success or not. In the past, vic-
tories over the Panthers have sal-
vaged poor seasons and losses have
ruined good ones. All that is cer-
tain this year is that it’s going to

Panthers. Ever since they lost to the Blue and Gold, 26-7,

last Nov. 12, Coach Art Lewis’ gridders haven’t forgiven or '

forgotten. The most consequential is they haven’t forgotten.

Around this _the battle will revolve. The Southern Con-
ference champs (they edged out Virginia Tech) will not only be
out to beat Pitt, but they are openly concerned with giving the
Steel City eleven a lacing in one of the most -obvious ways.

The Ridgerunners came to do gallant battle with the Panthers
last season. However, they apparently left their gallantry back
in the hills . . . or, maybe, probably, it was their perfect record
(7-0) which permitted them to dream bowl. The reverie boomer-
anged into a nightmare which has carried to the lidlifter at Moun-
taineer Field in Morgantown.

Embittering revenge is uppermost in the minds of the Lewismen.
This was, sorrily for them, brought to light when they suddenly dis-
covered that you can’t dream on a football ﬁeld. Instead of being
exulted in victory the Mounties were sulking in defeat. They’re still
brooding. That’s going to make them a ﬁghting team cast in an
underdog role. What could be more dangerous?

The great season has blessed the Panthers with confidence. A
weapon that is necessary in winning but can be unduly harmful,
too. Realizing the potency of overconﬁdence, Coach John Michelosen’s

 eleven will be geared for the occasion. They want to win. It’s not

 '-oi

-,«/‘shows 350 wins, 150 losses, and

merely going through the motions anymore. It’s going through the
motions with spirit and determination which assures winning.
A,quick glance at the personnel indicates that the Panthers
lost seven regulars from last year’s team while the Mounties did
likewise. The Panthers have so much depth, though, they are
actually stronger whereas the Lewismen are slightly weaker.
Graduation toll at WVU took such strength as All-American
tackles Bruce Bosley and Sam Huff. Plus backﬁeld 3085 Freddy
Wyant, Bob Moss, and Joe Marconi. Finding replacements for these ‘
ﬁve is the principle problem confronting Lewis and his aides.
They must be as good because the locals are stronger despite the
losses of John Cenci, Harold Hunter, John Paluck, Pete Neft,
Bobby Grier, and Lou Cimarolli.
Center, right guard, and right end are the shallowest spots in the
Blue and Gold forward wall. Filling these positions presentsqthe
major problemsand the overall team strength will be reﬂected by the

.3, ‘starters to these uncertain spots.

Chuck Brueckman, a 205-pound junior from Stowe Hwp., is po-
tentially a more than adequate replacement for the departed Cenci.
Although Brueckman made only brief appearances last season—-67 min-
utes of action in all-—he seems to have the ability to become an out-
standing linebacker on defense. I

The right guard post goes to Dan Wisniewski of Erie. Wis-
niewski is being pushed hard by John Guzik and Dick Carr, how-
ever, and either one could get the starting nod. If one of these
three can plug the hole _it will relieve what is considered the
weakest position in the line.

Right end ﬁnds three candidates as possible successors to Mean
John Paluck. They are Bob Rosborough, Dale ‘Brown, and Art Gob.
Rosborough, the heir apparent, has missed the first 10 days of practice
because of unﬁnished classroom work and might have to relinquish
the job to Brown until he rounds into top condition.

Smiles predominate when you take a peek at the other four start-
ers in the line: left end Joe Walton, left tackle Bob Pollock, left guard
Vince Scorscone, and right tackle Herm Canil. Hardly more needs to
be said.

West Virginia has supposedly been counting the days until
they get the Panthers on the gridiron again. Saturday’s struggle is
fast approaching._ Coach Michelosen commented earlier, “It’s
easier to write than to do.” Pitt will do.

  

 

Major casualty of the training grind has been sophomore
end Bob Hook of Brookﬁeld, Ohio. The diminuitive 5-ll,
175-pound terminal broke his right ankle in a scrimmage and
is expected to be out for the largest part of the season.

Dietrick To Assist
Frosh Coach Petro

When Coach Steve Petro sounds
the whistle for the opening of
freshman football drills he will
have as his assistant coach a for-
mer Panther end in Dick Diet-
rick.

The towering 6-4, 240—pound
terminal was the captain of the
1953 Blue and Gold team which
could show only a 3-5-1.record.
Although the record was below
the .500 mark, Dietrick was con-
sidered one of the top terminals
in the East.

TOUCH FOOTBALL

Anyone interested in organ-
izing touch football teams for
the coming season are asked to
attend a meeting Tuesday,
Sept. 25, in the Cathedral of
Learning. IM Director Leo
Bemis will announce the ex-
act time and place later in the
week or inter.ested parties can
contact him at the Field House
if they desire.

Dandy Dick is currently help-
ing Ernie Hefferle round the
Panther wingman into shape for
the West Virginiaclash; at Mor-_
gantown Sept. 22.

Besides assisting with frosh
practice Dietrick will be going to
medical school which should
leave him very little spare time.

As an undergraduate Dietrick
was ' an all around athlete. Be-
sides starring in football he .was
also a standout center on the
hoop team and played A’ first base
for the baseball team where he
made his name mostly as a long
ball hitter. .

not only has to contend with his
teammates but he also has to buck
the managers. In a recent practice
session Haley w en t scurying
around end only to be sent
sprawling to the ground -by Ed
Koltiska who dumped a tackling
dummy on him.

‘Fearless Experts

Offer Predictions
Hoping For Hope

Well, it’s football season again.
And along with the players, ra-
coon coats, canned-heat, etc.,
come the vaunted Pitt News
Yogis. To those of you who don’t
know, the Yogis are that uncanny
group of football experts on
campus who have the remarkable
ability to pick the results of
college football games wrong.

Leading the Yogis into battle
this year will be Steve “Scoop”
Butchock, who lost out in his at-
tempt to set a new low in pro-
gnosticating last year to a fellow
Swami, Irv “What’s Football”
Rothman. This’ year, however,
with Rothman again joining the
racoon coat, canned-heat, etc.,
section of the stadium it’s safe
to assume that Butchock will be
in a class by himself. .

On a slightly higher plane will
be Ed Igoltiska and . Rosemary
Ray. ”Koltiska, better known as
the only Pitt News Swami ever
to flatten a football player by
dropping a tackling dummy on his
head (see Panther Scratchings) is
using a scientiﬁc approach in an
effort to solve the problem of
coming up with some winners. “I
always pick the team with the
dark jersies to win,” he says
without bothering to explain why.
“It never misses,” he added. Ray,
on the other hand, picks the team
with the best looking players.

Adding some dignity (and
sense) to the whole affair
throughout the season will be a
Panther coach and player who
will also pick their choices each
week. Head coach Johnny Mich-
elosen and end Joe,Walton are
leading off for the boys who are
in the know.

As usual, the -Yogi’s are divided
in their selections. They did, how-

ever, get together on four con-
tests. All of them picked Pitt,
Notre Dame, Georgia Tech, TCU
and Hope to vanquish their es-
teemed opponents on opening day.
The last minute swing to the Hope
Dutchmen in their battle with the
Heidelberg Students Princes was
due mainly to a scouting report
turned in by Yogi Butchock who

spent the greatest part of last ‘

summer in Hope.

“Hope is just as strong as last‘

year when they won the Charity
Bowl game from Faith,” reports
Butchock. “And, as usual the
coach of the Hope Dutchmen has
high hopes of again ﬁelding a full
team of eleven players. If he
makes it, they’ll be rough.” "

Heidelberg, on the other hand,
has been well out of the race (Oh,
what a terrible pun: editor.) for
several seasons. and shows no im-
mediate signs of returning to the
heights it held during the Galic
Wars.

Sowell Practices

For Olympic Run

After one of the most gruesome
indoor and outdoor seasons in
many a year for a Panther ‘(rack-
ster, Arnie So‘.-icll has been prac-
ticing for the Olympic games at
Melbourne, Australia, late in 1".)-
vember. .

Coach Olson gave the Blue ‘ind
Gold sprinter two months of rest
this summer because as the v:ter-
an coach put it, ‘_‘Sowe1l n___:cded
it.”

The 800—meter aspirant has been
working out since Labor Day
and Coach Olson is pleased with
the progress so far.

Should Sowell win an Olympic
gold medal it will mark only the
second athlete in the history of
the University to accomplish this
feat. The only -other gold medal
winner was the great Johnny
Woodruff in the 1936 games when
he won the same 800-meter title.
