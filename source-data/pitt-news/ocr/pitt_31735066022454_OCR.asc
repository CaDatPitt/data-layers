Former political prisoner urges letter writing

By Jeff Griffin
Stat)" Writer

Over a span of 10 years, Kumar
Muthukumaraswamy witnessed the brutal
torture and murder of his friends in Sri Lanka
during that government’s crackdown on the
country’s minority Hindus.

Imprisoned for his political views,
Muthukumaraswamy believed he would die
in captivity by the hands of Sri Lanka’s
oppressive Ceylonese government ofﬁcers.

Close to death and in a demoralized mental
state in the early ’80s, Muthukumaraswamy’s
life was spared, in part, by a letter sent by a
member of Amnesty International to a member
of the Sri Lanka Parliament.

“The parliament is a public forum, and the
government could not ignore the letter,”

Muthukumaraswamy said. “The minister of _

defense tried to stop my release, but within
four weeks I was released for eight hours.

“I became a human being again,” he recalled.
“I could feel humanity again.”

Muthukumaraswamy’s eight-hour reprieve
led eventually to his release from prison. The
United States granted him political asylum,
and he subsequently graduated from the
University of Pennsylvania. He now practices
international law in Philadelphia. '

Muthukumaraswamy recounted his
experiences in the William Pitt Union Ballroom
last night as part of the Fourth Annual Human
Rights Week sponsored by Pitt's Amnesty
International student group.

Remembering" his own struggle,
Muthukumaraswamy now counsels other
political dissidents; ,

“I cringe when they tell me their stories
because I remember my own torture,” he
explained. “I want people to know that
torture and political oppression occurs in
many countries today.”

Muthukumaraswamy’s own experiences
included a trip with 12 other prisoners to Sri
Lanka’s “Forth Floor,” which is considered to
be the worst prison in the world.

“It looked like a workout station room,” .

Muthukumaraswamy said. “I smelled a human
smell like people had died there. There was
blood on the ﬂoors.” ‘ I

AI named Muthukumaraswamy a prisoner
of conscience for his non—violent protesting.

“When beaten by the police, many people
turn violent,” Muthukumaraswamy explained.
“Amnesty International will not endorse or
help. political prisoners if they advocate
violence.” ‘

Muthukumaraswamy said letters from the
United States carry “extra weight.”

“I hate to say this, but the U.S. helps the bad
guys through foreign aid, and when they
receive letters, they feel threatened,”
Muthukumaraswamy said.

“America has a major weapon. It’s not
smart bombs that are used to destroy,” he
added. “The weapons are pens, which are
weapons of construction. My government
will listen to one letter and ignore thousands
of its protesting citizens.”

This year’s Write—A-Thon, slated for Nov.
22 at 8 p.m. in the Schenley Cafe.

‘Gas leak’
empties
Wﬂliam
Pitt Union

By David T. Welch
Asst. News Editor

A suspected gas leak in the
William Pitt Union Friday caused
students to evacuate the building
while city fire fighters searched
for the source of the fumes.

Fire fighters and Pitt officials
determined that there was no
leak but disagreed about the cause
of the odor, saying it came from
sewer gas or fumes from a truck
in the union loading dock.

Someone pulled an alarm in
response to the odor around 4:40
p.m., according to Pitt
Environmental and Safety
Director Lawrence Keller.

Keller said the odor could have
been caused by diesel fumes from
a truck in the loading dock
between 7-Eleven and the union.
“It is possible that someone had
the door opened between the
[Schenley Cafe] kitchen and the

loading dock and changed the

ventilation,” Keller said.

Bob Hrosky, Battalion
Commander of Fire House 14,
disagreed, saying that the
odor was probably from sewer
gas.

“It wasn’t gasoline  We used
gas meters and there were no
combustible or explosive gases
in the atmosphere of thatbuilding.
There is no gas service in that
building. It’s all electric  It was
probably sewer gas that leaked
up, nothing explosive. Obviously
it seeped up through an area
totally undetected,” Hrosky
said.

Fire ﬁghters always evacuate a
building in response to a gas leak
in case there is danger of harm to
the occupants, Hrosky said.

According to Keller, the fumes
were not dangerous.

“There was an odor initially
reported as natural gas. The first
thing you do is get everybody out
of there. Then you systematically
start eliminating the obvious,
using gas meters and that sort of
thing," Hrosky said.

Alarms did not sound on all
floors of the union. Keller said
alarms sound only on the ﬂoor
where an alarms is it is activated
on and the floor above and below.

Other ﬂoors are then informed
of the need to evacuate, according
to Keller.

This is the acceptable way to
evacuate a high-rise building, he
said.

C omic books notjastfor /ez'a’s

By Carolyn Oliver
For T be Pitt News

Twenty-ﬁve dollars for a comic
book? It may seem a little
expensive, but that’s how much
Comic Book Club President Joe
Babinsack paid for a special
edition about the rock group Kiss.

The idea of college students
coming together to discuss and
trade comic books may appear

8 unusual, but according to member

Deke Parsons, the prime age
target of most comic books today

-is 21 or 22.

“It’s like some people are with

'movies. I enjoy lcomic books],
‘reading them and not just

collecting,” Parsons said. “The
stories relate through the issues,
and characters age, die, and
change?

“Yeah, they’re just like a big
soap opera,” saidjoe Foner, also
a member of the club.

Comic books are not just
superheroes ﬁghting the bad guys.
They tackle issues such as racism
and drug abuse. Some of the

heroes, especially those who are
mutants, have tohide from the
government, according to
Parsons.

One member of the club, Pitt
alumnus Henry Tjerlund,
admitted that he probably hasn't
read many of the comic books he
owns. “I like independent
productions and buy for artwork
rather than story.”

Comic books got a big boost in
the 19805 with the popularity of
the film Batman, which was
aimed at adults. After that, many
comic—book companies adapted
their story lines for adults,
Babinsack/said.

In addition to being published
in singleissues, comic books are

also published in book-length

collections of past issues. “The
reprintings really help, especially
if there weren’t many issues
published initially,” said member
Bill Scholey.

“The stories get exposure, and
the curious don’t have to spend
an arm and a leg,” Scholey
added.

Patients at cerebral-palsy center become honorary Greeks

By Jonathan Bloch
Staff Writer

Greek Week took its first steps
in a new direction when Pitt
Greeks welcomed honorary
members into their brotherhoods
and sisterhoods Thursday night.

About 200 Greeks visited the
United Cerebral Palsy Center in
North Oakland as part of the new
Volunteer category of Greek
Week. ,

GreeklWeek had been mainly
concerned with raising money,
but this year the new Volunteer
category, worth 10 percent of
Greek Week, demands that
Greeks donate some of their
enthusiasm and energy to charity,
according to Kim Fricchione,
overall Greek Week co-chair.

“I think we lost sight that Greek
Week is really about helping
people who are less fortunate
than we are, and the best way to
get that message back into Greek
Week is to interact with these
people and just be their friends,”
said Fricchione.

Upon entering the center,
representatives from each
fraternity and sorority received
name tags and a puzzle piece
which partially spelled out their

STUI)F.N,T/FACULTY
DISCOUNT

AIRFARES

TO

EUROPE
FORBES TRAVEL
S21-7300

 

 

Greek letters. After the event
started, they had to ﬁnd the patient
with the matching puzzle piece.
The patient who held the missing
piece was that fraternity’s or
sorority’s new brother or sister.

Kappa Kappa Gamma’s
encounter turned out to be a fam-
ily reunion of sorts because its
honorary sister, Daphne Shirk,
was already a member of the
sorority.

Shirk, 25, was a sister at Kappa
Kappa Gamma when . she
attended Allegheny College in
Meadville, Pa. In 1989, during
her junior year, Shirk was studying
abroad in London when she was
struck by a bus.

All the clients at the cerebral
palsy center either have cerebral
palsy or have suffered damage
from head injuries,,according to
an attendant.

After her accident, Shirk could
not walk or talk. It took her three
years of rehabilitation, but now
any damage she sustained is
hardly noticeable. -She even plans
on attending Pitt in the spring.

“I feel excited to get back into
social life, but also I’m scared that
I won’t do well in school,’{ Shirk
said.

Many Greeks seemed a bit shy

when approaching clients for the
first time, but others were very
forward and friendly.

Cheri Todaro of Alpha Delta Pi
walked right up to her honorary
sister, Helen Davis, smiled, and
introduced herself.

“This is for you, Helen, ” Todaro
said handing her a smiley-face
balloon.

Davis is unable to speak, so
she spells out what she wants to
say by pointing to letters of the
alphabet in front of her on her
wheelchair.

“Thanks,” Helen spelled out.

Todaro knelt down next to
Helen, and the two began to talk.

I

“What kind of music do you
like, Helen?" Todaro asked.

“Led Zeppelin,” Helen said.

“Really? That’s my favorite
group! I have all their tapes and
[compact discs]. You can borrow
any one you’d like,” Todaro said.

Mary Lou Busby, the director
of the Center for Personal
Development at UCP, said she
was happy to see the Greeks
who came to the center to greet
the patients. It was important for
people in the community to see
disabled people’s capabilities,
rather than just their limitations,
according to Busby.

Most of the patients seemed to

enjoy the attention they received I

from their new brothers and
sisters.

“It’s so rare that they enjoy
freely volunteered relationships.
Most of the people in their lives
are paid to be there,” Busby said.

Last Thursday’s get—together'
was the first of five scheduled
volunteer events, but Greeks are
being encouraged to get to know
their new brothers and sisters.

The next volunteer event is a
phone-a-thon which begins

today. Pitt Greeks will be at the " 

UCP center until Thursday,
phoning people who have
previously donated to the center.

 ‘The ‘ ‘ only " person "who" ‘1's“

—-a sister of Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority

University of Pittsburgh students work
hard all year trying to earn enough money
to pay for tuition. Considering how high
that tuition is and how quickly the rate
increases every year, students often wonder
how their money is being distributed. As
a concerned student I feel that since J.
Dennis O’Connor became president of
Pitt, our money has been spent rather
unwisely.

First, President O’Connor’s office was
remodeled for about $82,000. Yes, maybe
his office needed some changes, but that
price was somewhat unnecessary. Then
his house was renovated for another
outrageous amount of money. And
recently, during the Student Government
Board elections, students voted on ‘a
possible North Oakland shuttle expansion,
a computer facility in North Oakland and
improvements in the weight room at Trees
Hall. Many would argue that these are
necessary, positive additions, but they
should not be tops on the campus-priority
list. ,

What should be the No. 1 priority is
campus safety and security. If you don't
agree, please consider the possibilities.

How would you like to be walking in
North Oakland with nine of your friends

and have seven people (one carrying a
knife) attempt to mug you?

' How would youlike to be walking down
Forbes Avenue and be wounded in a
drive-by shooting?

How would you like to walk out of I
Forbes Quadrangle and be sexually

assaulted?

How would youlike to be walking home
from a party in South Oakland with your
girlfriend and have someone jump out of
the bushes and attack you with the intention
of severely harming you?

How would you like to be walking out
of the Towers on your way to Lothrop Hall
and finding yourself being attacked by
two men with guns who want to kill you?

Well, these aren’t scenarios. These are
actual occurrences which have happened
to our fellow students. The worst thing
about this is that hardly any of these
crimes have been reported to the student
body; only therﬁrst three were addressed
in The Pitt News. Instead, the
administration blocks this information from

students to keep enrollment up and tuition

payments rolling in. As a result, student
safety continues to be jeopardized.

These violent and ‘sexually related acts
are understandable, considering Pitt cut
the campus police budget by about
$200,000. This cut would most likely entail
a decrease in campus police personnel,
patrol cars, equipment, etc.

Pitt has tried to help students by creating
evening shuttles and a campus taxi service.
But the former goes to only specific
destinations, and the latter has not been
well publicized to the students. Plus, the
taxi does not go into service until 12:45
a.m. Emergency phones are a convenient,
fast way to communicate with campus
police, but access to one of the phones is
difficult when you’re being mugged or
sexually assaulted. '

I’m not saying that these kinds of
incidents did not happen last year because
they did. But they seem to be more
prevalent this term. In fact, it is rumored
that about 80 students have -transferred
from Pitt and Carnegie Mellon due to the
increase in the violent crimes in the local
area.

Having one police officer patrolling
Litchﬁed Towers‘and all of the Schenley
Quadrangle dormitories, one police officer

lame for lack of safety, security...  

patrolling Forbes Quad‘ and the rest
“hanging out” at the “O” and “7-Eleven” is
just not enough to ensure the safety of
students.

The university must improve the quality
of existing personnel in the campus police
force, and the number of police officers on
this campus needs to be increased.

Improvements in the. faculty, program
expansions, face lifts for existing buildings
and the construction of new buildings
have been top priorities in the recent Pitt
administration. If a large percentage of
students were to leave Pitt out of fear for
their lives, these changes would no longer
be possible.

We, the students, and our safety and

. 5’
J ..

well—being should be given the greatest ‘

attention. It is ridiculous and unfair to the
students that it has become unsafe to walk
around campus — even in groups.
Something must be done now to change
this problem before more students are
harmed. This dilemma requires immediate
attention, and that responsibility lies in the
hands of J. Dennis O’Connor and his
board.

Todd Rimer is a Pitt junior majoring in
business. '0

..’.But students must also take responsibility for actions

The opinions expressed in the
Nov. 13, front—page article,
“Assault victim’s sorority sisters
demand action,” were nothing
more than scapegoating. The
“angry sorority women” seemed
to think their presence would
bring’ about a solution to the
problem. However blaming their
sister's assault on the campus

Director William Brennan is not
in any way helping to find a
solution.

It seems that the Greeks have
come out in full force once again
but are lacking in ideas. The
sisters of Kappa Kappa Gamma
want a quick solution, but it is not
that easy. Just standing up and
saying that we need more campus

safety and a better shuttle system
‘is not solving anything. '

responsible for this act is the
criminal. And since there was no
one arrested, scapegoating is
much more convenient.
Inadequate campus safety seems
like a big concern. The
distribution of police whistles is a
definite deterrent of crime;' it’s
just that some people_would rather
play with them than use them for
their intended purpose. This
makes a criminal’s job much
easier.

In fact, poor judgement on the
students’ part is a large factor in
campus crime. If people are given
the opportunity to commit a
crime, they will do it. This type of
person must be avoided or at
least outsmarted.

By not going through
dangerous areas and not walking
alone, the opportunity for the

-'criminal will be‘ lessenedand the'

crime may be avoided. I am not
saying this or any other assault is
a victim's fault, but better
judgement is needed.

As for Student Government
Board member Gil Golden calling
Oakland a “scum—ﬁlled pit hole,”
I think he is going a bit too far.

Golden’s idea of starting an escort '

service seems logical, but the
existing shuttle service is
supposed to be adequate.

However the shuttle service is
a bit confusing. Perhaps a list of
shuttle times and a description of
the service should be distributed
to students. This would make the
system more useful.

~ ': ‘:~.1>.,2s.:"’

There is some degree of
paranoia surrounding this
situation. This was represented
by the student who was worried
about being “dragged into a field
and raped” while waiting 15
minutes for a shuttle. This type of
thinking says that crime is
anticipated. If you are this
paranoid, I would suggest that
you not leave your home.

Obviously protection is
available. There are both local
and campus police as well as a
shuttle service. This is not a
foolproof plan for crime stopping.
I think better judgement is needed
on the students’ behalf. There is
no way to be protected in all
places atall times. Butby avoiding
areas which you think may be
dangerous and not traveling
alone, your own safety will be,

increased.’ ‘ A,

As far as the administration is
concerned, I do not think the’
blame lies with any member or

to work with students to find
solutions. I do not see the point
of trying to get in touch with
President J. Dennis O’Connor
about _the subject. I’m sure he is
aware of the situation and is as
concerned as the rest of us.

The people on the

there to deal with these problems.
Your safety is partly up to you.
Do not let it lie within the hands

'I'H:E PI'l'I' NEWS, Monday, November 18, 1991

 

  

Safety on our campus has
always been a major issue.
Everyone who is a part of this
university is concerned about the
safety and security they hold as
they walk across campus. In the
office of the Student Government
Board that is no exception. From
past boards to this year’s board
and even to next, you continually
see campaign promises that center
around campus safety.

Until recently, only an on-
campus CrimeStop and various
committees have been established
to assist in the ﬁght against an
unsafe university. All methods
have been working to their fullest
“known potentials,” but why all
the recent onslaughts of crime on
our campus? Something must be
done —— and done soon before all
you see on Oakland streets are
criminals.

- At last week’s SGB meeting, a
monumental occasion was seen.
Nearly 50 sisters of Kappa Kappa
Gamma sorority attended, stood
up and showed an interest in
wanting something changed. I
say monumental, for never before,
since the beginning of my term in
office, have we ever gotten any
feedback on how, when and what
to do about the safety on our
campus. Student apathy is at an
all—time high, but that is not to say
that something shouldn’t be done.
I commend those 50 sisters who
stood up for their friend; but now
action must be taken.

0 After the meeting, a committee
was setup through the SGB office

It’s time for students to ta/ee a stand

Andy
Gould 5

to look into measures that can
and should be taken care of now.
The committee consists of:
William Brennan, director of the
Department of Public Safety; Dr.
William Harmon, director of [the
Office of] Student Affairs and
various students. The ‘students
are key because we are the ones
to voice our opinions to the
hierarchy so that something can
be done.

It is obvious that we need more
police patrols, more security in
the buildings and more lighting
on campus, so here’s the place to
stand up and let your vote count.

The University of Pittsburgh is
in a budget slump, but if safety is
holding a lot of weight, then
funds can be transferred from

' something that isn’t high on the

priority list. Only the students
determine how much weight this
will carry. If we show interest,
the administration has no other
choice but to do something in
response.

Another project the SGB is
working on is to rearrange the
entire shuttle system. We are
proposing a plan to obtain more
shuttles, extend the current routes
(making Duquesne and Carnegie
shuttles available for our use)
and utilizing the campus police
as a type of “taxi” service. All of
these current SGB projects are

being handled through the office
and the committee I mentioned
earlier.

CrimeStop is still a major
advantage and [members] plans
to continue-to aid in the residence-
hall security. However I have
been passing my ideas on to the
next board, and an off-campus
CrimeStop should prove to be a
reality in the next term. With this,
we hope to see a system of
captains working with campus
police to acquire twice as much
police patrol as well as police-
student communication. The
safety committee, established last
term, is also a main adversary in
making this project as much a
success as the on-campu
CrimeStop. '

All of these programs and ideas
I have mentioned have one thing
in common: All cannot be
accomplished by 8 people — or
even 58. It mustbe a campuswide
effort. Join with everyone on
campus. Attehd SGB meetings
on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. Be like
the -sisters of Kappa Kappa
Gamma, and show an interest.

It is a shame that it takes all of
the recent crimes to open
everyone’s eyes, but now is the
time to take a stand against the
lack of security on the Pitt campus.
Let your voice be heard and your
actions seen.

Inefficiencies must be remedied

Being a female student concerned about my
safety and the safety of others, I attended the
Student Government Board meeting last Tuesday
night. Along with me attended 40 of my sorority
sisters. We [had] hoped to reach conclusive answers
on what Pitt is doing to make this a safer campus.

support the Department of Public Safety, but one of
the main problems is inadequate funding for the
department. _
Is the employment of 100 campus police adequate
for a university with an estimated enrollment of
27,000 students? The ratio of 1 to 2,700 is absurd.

Unfortunately, after hearing Mr.
William Brennan, director of the
Department of Public Safety, I
feel no safer than I did before.
We know that it is not Mr.

Christine
Wyckoff

I’ve learned to accept the fact that
this lack-of protection is due to
budget cuts. Our tuition bills are
loaded with fees, including one
for student activities and one for

Brennan's fault that only 100
campus police are employed to protect us.
Unfortunately, if we all worked at the “O,” we'd be
safe. However if we are anybody else and like to
study in private areas, our safety is in jeopardy.

Almost two weeks ago, a young woman was
studying in what was considered to be a “safe” all-
night study area. She was assaulted at gunpoint.
Ironically enough, she was studying in the same
building [that houses] the campus police
headquarters, and not one of [the officers] was
anywhere in the vicinity [when] her abduction took
place.

Mr. Brennan, we would have worked together
with you before, but unfortunately, we were
uninformed about how unsafe this campus actually
is. It's difficult for students to address problems that
they are unaware of.

We, as students, know and understand that the
Student Government Board is doing the best that it
can to ensure our safety. It's the officials of the
administration that are giving us the runaround. I

.«,},'.~:.i:m'.-. -.:l.z,:=.gs~!:.i_s*:t $1.‘?-I\'J'-{Z15 .

' ‘think it is ‘ob‘vious‘now that students are willing to

computer networking. It seems a
viable option to add another fee — this time for
public safety. I don’t think we would find a large
percentage of Pitt students (or their parents, for that
matter) who would object to paying a Department
of Public Safetyfee of five dollars or even 20 dollars
to ensure our well-being.

The Department of Public Safety needs to realize
that the inefficiencies in its program need to be
dealt with now. Being a student at Pitt should not
include living in fear of what lurks behind the next
corner. What it should include is a safety program
that meets the needs of students — not the needs
of the budget.

We can only hope the university will get more
involved in a more efficient safety-prevention
program. We can no longer tolerate reactionary
precautions after the damage has already been
done.

Escort service must be
developed on campus

I would like to address the role of students in the recent
campus—security events. Last year I was a first-year student at
Syracuse University and transferred to Pitt this fall. As I live off-
campus, I had not been aware until recently of the lack of an
escort service. I do not know how many of you know the
campus situation at Syracuse two years ago, but it was
absolutely plagued with sexual assaults, including rape and
other violent crimes. Upon the developments of the preceding
year, a simple yet very effective escort plan was implemented
to insure the safety of students ﬁnding late—night travel necessary.
Students volunteered for duty and actually-(gasp!) gained
satisfaction from helping other students!

Now without going into too much detail, I spent my lunch
hour between classes a few days ago informally proposing a

James Berman

similar escort plan to Mark Rosen, chairperson of the [SGB]
Public Safety Committee. My initiative to do so came about after
seeing Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority sisters on television
approach William Brennan, director of the Department of
Public Safety, the previous evening. After my discussion with
the very receptive Rosen, he said, with much enthusiasm, the

realistic possibility of applying the recommendation I had .

offered as well as several others that were being considered
[existed].

He also went on to tell me that the committee, as well as the
Student Government Board, has been showing concern for
students. Coincidentally, it is the students whoare just now
starting to show concern for themselves.

I would like to know, how many of you carry whistles? How
many of you travel in groups? And are you in groups all the time
or just when it is convenient? How many of you attended the
public-safety meeting a few Saturdays ago? How many of you
respond to the incessant pleas for input from the SGB? Well,
only four of you were at the meeting  Four.

“I’m busy.” ‘‘I’m going out with my friends.” ‘‘I have work to
do.” Here is a grim thought: Enjoy that night out because for
anybody on this campus, it may be a night scarred with tragedy
as a result of violent crime.

What will happen whenyou go on to be viable assets of
society after graduation? Let me ponder your responses for
taking the role of being irresponsible: “I have to pick the kids
up at the nursery,” ‘‘I’m too tired,” ‘‘I’m playing cards with by
buddies tonight.” I do not want to change the world with one

- article, but there is a veryclear apathy that exists on this campus

that must be dealt with.

Here you have an overwhelmingly receptive board of students
whom some of you took the time to vote for, but the great
resource of their showing concern and ability to attempt change
goes unexploited. And by whom? You! The sisters of KKG took
initiative (finally) and made a very clear point at the SGB
meeting.

However, as Rosen pointed out, where was all this concern
last year or last month? Go and flood SGB with your input. At
least if they can not do everything, you will have someone to
blame other than yourselves.

Unfortunately, you really have no right to blame anyone,
including campus security (or lack thereof) for the malicious
attack on the female student two weeks ago. As I was greeted
by a very welcoming group of people interested in my concern,
I implore you to meet these people on a regular, professional
level.

Since arriving at Pitt, I have read articles (almost weekly)
either about the students’ discontent with SGB or students
being blasted for the clear presence of apathy by the SGB. If you
would give up an evening of socializing and open your mouths
at a meeting once in a while, maybe some unfortunate events
can be avoided, and some more pleasant events may even

.come about. - .

If you have the time to open your mouth to swill beer, you
have time to open your mouth at a meeting.

Women
swimmers
fall short
of Cavs

By Brian Gallagher
Sta_ﬂ' Writer

The swimming tandem
of Karen Burgess and
Annette Bultema combined
for ﬁve ﬁrst—place ﬁnishes
to lead the University of
Virginia women to a 164.5-
127.5 dual-meet victory
over the Pitt women last
Saturday in Charlottesville,
Va. The meet featured
several events decided by
less than a second,
including one tie.
Unfortunately for Pitt, the
Cavaliers took most of those
events.

A tone was set in the ﬁrst
event of the meet, the 200-
yard medley relay, when
the Cav relay team slipped
past Pitt with a time of
l:/19.58 [O l’ilL'S l:/19.75.
Virginia continued to pull
out tight victories, with
Burgess edging Panther
sophomore Jen Burns in
the 100-yard backstroke by
/3 seconds. In the one-
meter event, junior diver
Tracie Prestegiacomo
topped Pitt’s Donna Flatch
for first place, 147.65-
1/i6.10. All told, the
Cavaliers went on totake
first place in nine of the
next 11 events to blow the
meet open.

Pitt head coach David
Belowich was particularly
impressed with Virginia's
experience and team depth.
“Their depth was the
difference,” Belowich said.
“l’iguringoutawaytowork
around their depth was
tough, in terms of winning
the meet.”

Belowich mentioned
Burgess as one Virginia
swimmer with the ability to
determine the outcome of
most events in which she
participates (including
relays). ‘‘I knew that if she
swam in only one of the
two relay events (200—yard
medley, /iO0—yard freestyle),
that we’d take the one she
wasn’t in," Belowich said.
“She only swam in the
medley event (won by
UVa), and we won the
freestyle relay."

With the win, the
Cavaliers improved their
dual-meet record to 3-0.
Pitt has dropped two meets
in a row, and its dual-meet
record now stands at 2-2.

Despite the loss, the Pitt
head coach was satisfied

with the efforts of his senior

Defense. It’s an essential
element necessary for any team
to be successful. It has been
repeatedly said that defense wins
championships. If that’s so, then
after yesterday’s performance
against the Steelers, the
Washington Redskins should
order the Super Bowl rings now.

In their 41-14 win, the ‘Skins
(ll-O), who clinched a playoff
berth, did not allow the Pittsburgh
offense to cross midﬁeld until the
end of the second quarter. The
Steelers (4-7) could only muster
41 yards on the ground, as the
Washington defenders confused
young quarterback Neil
O'Donnell into making bad
decisions.

As if that was not bad enough,
the Redskins came out pumped
up and drove the ball inside the
Steeler 25 on every drive except
one. They converted crucial, third-
down plays when they had to
and punted the ball away only
once.

Pittsburgh looked much the
same way it has all year —— dazed
and confused. It did not get a
drive going until the beginning of
the second quarter. Even then,
an interception by Washington’s
Martin Mayhew stopped them at
their own 44. The next Steeler
drive led them to their 42. Then a

Carrie Thornton and the Pitt volleyball team got three weekend wins.

While Florida State’s football
team was blowing yet another
opportunity at a national title, the
volleyball team was having
problems of its own. It was one
of three teams to be run over by
the 20th-ranked Pitt volleyball
team, as the Panthers stretched
their winning streak to 10 at this
weekend’s Florida State
Tournament.

Pitt opened Friday afternoon
against the 20-12 Temple Owls.
The Panthers took control early
and kept it, winning the ﬁrst two
games by 15-5 scores.

That performance included a
second game in which Pitt had a
.588 hitting percentage, compared
to a horrendous .150 for the Owls.
The third game was closer, but it
was still a Pitt win by a score of
15~1l.

For the match, -the Panthers
had a .292 hitting percentage,
and Temple hit a very low .060.

Senior outside hitter Linda Zols
led the way for Pitt with 15 kills,
a .357 percentage and six digs.
Senior co-captain Dee MacAulay
had eight kills and no hitting
errors for a .800 percentage.

The other co-captain, Sue
Zonneville, and the team leader
in kills and digs, sophomore Ann
Marie Lucanie, each had four
kills in limited time. Zonneville

played in only one game; Lucanie
in two.

Two players who filled in off
the bench, senior Shelly Seanor
and first—year player Chelsea
Hemingway, had strong defensive
matches with 15 and nine digs,
respectively.

Next came the Saturday
afternoon matchup with the host
Lady Seminoles, a team that Pitt
assistant coach Cindy Braziel said
would be the toughest opponent
of the weekend.

Florida State’s volleyball team
didn’t come into the weekend
looking as formidable as its
football counterparts, entering the
match with a 14-12 record, but it
gave Pitt as hard a time as it had
all weekend.

The Panthers took the first two
games by scores of 15-13 and 15-
3 before losing their only game of
the weekend, 9-15.

Pitt retook control of the match
and won the fourth game 15-2. A
.125 hitting percentage for Pitt
was less than impressive but much
better than the .022 FSU amassed.
Another advantage was serving.
Both teams had 10 errors, but Pitt
had 12 aces, while the Lady
Seminoles had five.

Lucanie played the whole way
this time, racking up match highs
with 19 kills and 21 digs, but she
also had 11 hitting errors. Zols
also had 11 hitting errors to go

Gallagher andjanine Atiyeh. “You

expect seniors to step it up a

notch, go to that next level,”
Belowich said. “Crit Gallagher far
and away stepped up a level.”
A senior freestyle sprinter,
Gallagher took first place in a
tight 50-yard freestyle race with a
time of 24.85 seconds. Her time
was .09 seconds ahead of Cavalier
senior Julie Domecq, who

finished second in 24.94 seconds.
Gallagher also anchored Pitt’s
victorious 400—yard freestyle relay,
doing it in dramatic fashion. “In
the free relay, [Gallagher] came
from a full second behind to take
the event,” Belowich said. “She
really had the type of meet that I
expect a senior to have.”

As for Atiyeh, a senior
backstroke specialist who placed
second in the 200—yard
backstroke, Belowich said he

thinks her inﬂuence as a swimmer
and tri-captain is not appreciated
and noticed nearly enough.
“Along with Crit, Janine really
gave an excellent effort,”
Belowich said. “Her 200 [—yardl
backstroke was her best ever in

Other Panthers with winning

Men’s swzmmmg loses to Vzrgzmoz

By Jim Lakely
suqrwmer

A tired Pitt men’s swim team
was seemingly overmatched and
overwhelmed in a 138-105 loss to
a nationally ranked University of
Virginia squad on Saturday.

The Panthers squeaked by
Syracuse in a dual meet two weeks
ago but paid the price by
exhausting themselves. In Virginia
the Cavaliers won many events
by only a touch, and in those
close races Pitt didn’t have the
steam to push past the Cavaliers.

In fact, if some of the Panthers
could have touched the wall

ahead of Virginia in a few of
those events, there could have
been a 20-point swing in the ﬁnal
score.

“I think we did a pretty decent
job,” 'said senior Joe Kozlina,
“considering that in the past we
have lost to them by 50 to 60
points.”

The meet began on a high note
for the Panthers, when the 400-
yard medley-relay team of Matt
Brady, Don Boyd, David Dodson
and Kozlina opened the meet
with a victory.

But Pitt would never lead the
meet again, and there was little
tangible evidence of what head

coach Chuck Knoles described
as a successful meet.

Virginia is a national swimming
power and contender for the
Atlantic Coast Conference
championship, a conference with

‘deep tradition.

“I was really pleased to stay
that close to Virginia,” Knoles
said. “We didn’t go into the meet
thinking we were going to walk
away with it. We just wanted to
compete at top, Division I
swimming level, and I think we
did that.”

Despite the lopsided score,
Knoles said he was very pleased

The Panthers did most of the blazing, winning 15-8, 15-9, 15-
5. UAB had more hitting errors than kills, 23 to 21, as did their
team leader in kills, Kim Arnold, who had six kills and eight
errors. _

Lucanie and MacAulay continued their strong weekends.
Lucanie had 11 kills, 12 digs and a .450 percentage, while
MacAulay racked up seven kills, nine digs and a .400 percentage.

The Panthers’ record now stands at 24-6. They enter the Big
East tournament this weekend at Fitzgerald Field House. Pitt
lost only one game, as it won all seven conference matches and
capped its perfect season against conference opponents with
last Sunday’s three—game sweep of Villanova.

Pitt has not lost a conference game and will be the top seed
as the Panthers go for their fourth straight Big East championship.
Last year they became the first team to win it three straight times.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November 18, 1991

 

Steelers

Continued from page 6
straight out of the Keystone Kops
ended that threat.

After a sack by the ‘Skins’Jumpy
Geathers put the ball at the
Pittsburgh 46 and a holding
penalty, O’Donnell completed the
second-and—51 pass to tight end
Eric Green for a 29-yard gain.
Then with third and two from the
Washington 46, O’Donnell spiked
the ball into the turf, making it
fourth and two. Then he headed
to the sideline without calling for
the timeout. On fourth and two
O’Donnell dropped back to pass
but was sacked again by Geathers,
this time losing the football. After
a scuffle for the ball in which

umpire Ed Fifﬁck was shaken up,
the Redskins came up with the
ball at the Pittsburgh 49. They
marched 30 yards in five plays
only to have Chip Lohmiller miss
from 36 yards, his second misﬁre
of the afternoon, keeping the
score 17-0.

The Redskins added 10 points
to their lead early in the third
quarter on a 41-yard Lohmiller
boot and a one—yard touchdown
run by Gerald Riggs, his second
of the afternoon. Then with 5:59
remaining in the third, the
hibernating Steeler offense awoke
for the first time. It drove the ball
71 yards on 12 plays. Adrian
Cooper collected his second

career catch for his first career
touchdown, pulling the Steelers
to 27-7.

Pittsburgh held Washington on
the next possession and got the
ball back on its own 14. After
Merrill Hoge lost four yards on
first down, O’Donnell completed
a pass to Lipps for seven yards
and then to Calloway for 21 and

the first down at the Steeler 38. ,

O’Donnell followed with a 22-
yard strike to Lipps to the
Washington 40. On the next play,
Dwight Stone got loose behind
the corner, and O’Donnell hit
him for a touchdown. Gary
Anderson’s ensuing extra point
pulled the Steelers to within 15

‘points. That was as close as
Pittsburgh could get, as the
Redskins scored two more
touchdowns, one under backup
quarterback Jeff Rutledge.

Steelers’ Coach Chuck Noll was
unusually upbeat after the
Steelers’ loss. However he was
not overly enthusiastic about his
team.

“You’d like to think that you
are better than you look, but our
defense started slow and the
offense didn’t get started until
later,” Noll said. “You can’t place
that blame on any one part ofthe
defense because the entire unit
just didn’t perform.”

The players took the loss harder

with many of his swimmers’
performances. Eric Mattson
posted a near-lifetime best in the
200—yard individual medley and
finished second in the 200
breaststroke behind consistent
champion Don Boyd.

Pitt also continued its traditional _

strong showing in the diving

events led by three—meter
champion Sean Braud and junior
Micheal Naylor.

Knoles recruited very well last
year, and his first—year class hasn’t
let him down. Blue chipper Matt
Brady earned that label with his
very strong performance. He won
the 200—yard backstroke and
placed third in the 200 individual

medley, just behind teammate
Mattson.

Knoles admitted to looking past
the meet against Virginia, gearing
the team to peak for the Pitt
Invitational held Dec. 5 through
7. In fact, the team took a three-
mile run to get its legs warmed up
two hours before the meet. This
tactic is not exactly a short-term

“We have talent, but we’re just
not playing well,” said safety
Carnell Lake. “I know that I was
playing hard; whether or not I
was playing smart is a different

However the best quote about
the Steelers’ defeat came from

'‘ By Christine Hanna
stag‘ Writer

Representatives from the FBI to the
‘Peace Corps came to Pitt Thursday to
recruit minority students at the annual

.« job fair sponsored by the Black Action
Society and the National Society for
Black Engineers.

‘-‘I think I’ve made some positive
contacts. I’ve opened up some eyes,”
said Pitt senior Gary Simpson.

 The fair helps area minority students
meet informally with recniiters to discuss
job opportunities and goals with
companies from around the country.

According to job-fair coordinator

' -7'»-' ‘.4;--41.2"

Nikeea Travis, approximately 30 to 40
percent of the hundreds of students who
attend will get jobs or internships.

CIA recruiter Dottie Thornes said the
CIA “desperately needs all cultures, it’s
vital. [The CIA] is looking for minority
students.”

“We think it’s certainly beneﬁcial by
having a place to view what companies
have to offer. We found it has gone very
well. It’s our sixth time here. We keep
coming back,” said John Helfenstein of
Coming lncorporated..

BAS Adviser James C. Raymond said,
“I think it has improved every year. We
had to refuse 10 to 12 companies.”

Raymond also said that there was a

THE PI'I'I' NEWS, Monday, November 18, 1991

Minority job fair benefits students, employers

consistent ﬂow of students throughout
the clay and the companies were very
pleased with the caliber of the students.

Kathy Christie of Pitt's Human
Resources Office said, “We all believe in
this. We think it’s a good impact. It’s a
help to us to bring in qualified
candidates.”

“I’d like to extend thanks to the BAS
for being able to harbor different
companies to students, like myself, who
are unable to leave the campus and meet

the companies. This is a greatexperience.

Other than meeting just the company,

'you’re meeting individuals from the

company,” said minority job fair
committee member Craig Ford.

Contraceptive
draws criticism

By Barbara Hoffmann
stag Writer

Vaginal Contraceptive Film has been
heavily advertised, but VCF’s effectiveness
against pregnancy and sexually transmitted
diseases draws strong criticism from
medical professionals.

VCF, which contains the spermicide
non-oxynol 9, is an unreliable form of
protection against the AIDS virus and is
only 80 percent effective in preventing
pregnancy, according to the Allegheny
County Health Department.

VCF

Continued from page 10
better than the use of a spermicide
alone [to prevent diseasesl,” said
Irene Hodge, a public educator at
the health department.

“The ingredients in [this
spermicide] can kill the [AIDS]
virus, but for it to be effective,
[VCF] has to be used in conjunction
with a condom. You cannot rely
on a spermicide alone,” she said.

VCF is a two—inch semi-
transparent square that is folded
and inserted into the vagina like
a tampon. It contains 72 milligrams
of non-ox_ynol 9, the same
spermicide used in foams,
suppositories and jellies.

Hodge said spermicide, such

as VCF, should coat the walls of '

the vagina and the cervix to gain
the most protection against the
AIDS virus and other sexually
transmitted diseases. A 15-minute
wait after insertion allows the
film to melt, but VCF is only
effective for up to one hour.
Ginger Tipping, a registered
nurse at In—Patient Education in
Family Planning at Magee-
Womens Hospital, said she has
never had anyone.ask her about
VCF and had difficulty finding
information about it.
[reference] book is 600 pages
long, and there is only one
paragraph on it.” Tipping said.
