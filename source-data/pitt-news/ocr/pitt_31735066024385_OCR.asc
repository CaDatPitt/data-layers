Charting Pitt’s
i Administration

What lt’s Like
On The
Very Top

Perhaps it‘s the size that makes it
seem intimidating. The figures, the
acres, the total amounts of every-
thing at Pitt are staggering. And

imagine if you werein charge of it ‘

all...

The responsibility for running the
University of Pittsburgh—~a major
university with a $254 million

' budget rests on the. shoulders ‘of

Chancellor Wesley Posvar.

The chancellor operates the uni-
versity like a mayor runs a large city
or a executive runs a corporation.
He supervises university manage-
ment on every level, from finances to
public relations. He appoints deans
and faculty members, and grants
tenure. The chancellor reports regu-
larly to the Board ofTrustees, which
consists of36 voting members and is
headed by Westinghouse executive
Robert Kirby.

The chancellor is also in charge of
securing resources to fund various
university programs or special pro-
jects. This includes an annual trip to
Harrisburg to make a pitch to the
legislature for increased
appropriations.

Finally, delegation is the chancel

lhe provost is assigned to keep

gress of the entire university. He is
the principal academic officer at
Pitt, which means he oversees aca-
demic programs and progress for
over 34,000 students.

The chancellor’s third adminstra-

position as senior vice-chancellor
for t_he health sciences, Stark is the
link between Pitt’s health sciences

includes Falk Library and the West-

find a job, and the Student Health
Service. 1 .

This maze of senior vice-
chancellors may .be confusing, but
it’s only the tip of the administrative

structure. Underneath each admin-

All The Scoop You Missed Last Year

Especially in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which hadV
to cut $850,000 from its budget for fiscal year I982 because V
of Pitt's tight_ financial situation. » 

 

That translated into reductions in the size ofthe College of Arts and Sciences Advising Center, fe_wer
numbers of teaching assistants or teaching fellows for some courses, plus a reduction in the rrumb’erof

part-time faculty. "”

FAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg broke the bad financial news toa packed FAS meeting last March. V
“There’s a generalgpublic reaction over expansionism in many areas, and the-universities are
suffering part of that broader movement,“ Rosenberg said. “We may not like it’, but we’re part of

what’s happening around us." " ~ .- *’

Rosenberg‘s statement. that/the cuts might'not be well_-liked was something of an understatement.
University «vreaction-generally ran against thecuts. The FAS, through circulation of a‘"petition, V

garnered. enough support to request a special meeting to learn more information about the cuts.

College of Arts and Sciences Dean lrwin Schulmantold ‘Chancellor Wesley Posvar that the cuts “are”

destroying us." V . i _ —. _
But the financial reali_ty of it was that the moneyjust wasn't there, at least according to Pitt’s Board
of Trustees. who passed a trim budget July I. - V

Pitt‘s Semester-at-Sea program made its l'ii*st’\'<iyage last
year, V . V -

The  Universe left last Feb. 6 with students and faculty:
members in tow fora cruise around the'wor|d. But it wasn’t a _
vacation. It was actuallya floating classroom where students '
received academic credit _and visited I0 ports around the A
world. i _ i \ .

The Semester-at-Sea program originated nationallv and was adopted by P-itt’ last vear.

'./«_ On May l3, Pitt‘s Board of Trustees gave the university _
if "V authorization to borrow up.to $13 million for the renovation ‘V
 of Schenley Hall, Pitt’s student union. A . ‘
The idea for the renovation has been on one drawing
board or another at Pitt for years, but now that funding has '
been approved, the first stages of the renovation are underway.
Actually, the renovations will include restoration of some ofschenley Hall s past. What now serves
as a student union used to be one of the most glamorous hotels in Pittsburgh. 1 .
i “We are designing a place for modern students, but.we are trying to maintain the flavor ofthe old
f—\ hotel as it once was," said architect John‘DenVcler.- _  _ ’ . _  ~
" Right now, Director of Student Activities Andy Smith is grappling with the problem of finding 
temporary homes for all the groups and student organizations based in Schenley Hall. Renovation will
be completed from the top floors on down; so student offices will have to be relocated before they can
move into new quarters in about a year and a half. The entire building should be completely renovated '
by the fall of I983. ' ' ~ ‘

Student Ativities At Pitt Are A

Mix

Of Engineers, Blacks, C reeks, Nurses

By LINDA MILLER /
Pm News Staff Writer

Whether or not you participate in -

student activities and organizations

while in college may be the deter- 7

mining factor in getting into gradu-
ate school or getting a job four years

‘ from.now.

According to Joyce Lee, a Pitt

V placement counselor, most employ-
_ ers look at both grades and activities

when considering aicollege graduate
for a job. ‘ /

“Ideally, an employer looks for a
student who has maintained a pretty
good Quality Point Average during.
school and has been active in activi-
ties on campus,” she said. “They also
look for leadership abilities he or she
might have displayed and at work
histories. '

Basically, employers want to see a
well-rounded person who knows
how to manage his or her time.”

, Bill Abraham, ‘president of the,
Student Government Board (SGB),
- offered another reason for partici-

pating in student organizations.
“Not only is it a learning experi-

ence, but it gives youa real sense of '

comradery,” he said. “It serves as a
social outlet.” ~
‘ The most popular of all social
outlets, when it comes to student
organizations, are Pitt’s Greek fra-
ternities and "sororities. Steeped in
tradition, they provide students with
analternative lifestyle that is filled
with numerous social and charity
events. ' ,. . .
Both Lee-rand Abraham point out
the valuable contributions activities
can make in deciding one’s future.
Practical experience through an

organization or club can often prove _

more valuable than some courses.

‘‘In student government, students’

interested in‘ law can get involved
with the Legal Awareness Commit-

tee,/"» Abraham said. “Or another}.

student interested in budget and

finance might join the Allocations,

Committee.” . ,
Other student governing organi-

      
 
   
     
   
   
   

izations that can provide similar

experiences include:
_Black Action Society (BAS)-—p

? The BAS is the representative voice‘

of black students at Pitt. It sponsors

cultural programs, lectures, semin-

ars, and the annual Black Week.

Engineering, Student Cabinet-
This cabinet is the governing body
that plans and implements services
for the engineering students and
promotes closer ties with faculty,
while providing for student input on
academic policies.

lnerfraternity Council and Pan-
hellenic Association (IFC and
PANHEL)——The IFC and PAN-
HEL are the governing bodies of
Pitt's fraternities and soroiities,
respectively. Both provide such
things as community clean-ups,

‘ charity drives and the highly suc-

cessful Greek Week.
Inter-Honorary Council (IHC)¥
The IHC is the student governing
body of all Pitt honoraries. During
the past year it sponsored a day-long
student leadership_ conference and"

4 Academic Week. ' ‘

Nursing Student Organization

(NSO)—’The NSO is the governing .
body of all students enrolled in the -

School of ‘Nursing. In addition to

‘providing various academic and

social events within the university, it
also sponsors various community
health projects. ‘ ' 1

‘Resident Student Association
(RSA’)—-The RSA‘is the governing
organization for dorm students that
provides a_direct and formal input to
the administration on dorm policies.

According to Terrence. Milani,
Assistant Director‘. of the Office of

Student Activities, the purpose of A’

student activities is “to provide addi-
tional opportunities for learning and
personal development for 's'tudents.,-”.-’
The Office of Student Activities,
located on the first ﬂoor of the stu-
dent union, is responsible for the ;
managementof the union, the advis-
ing of student organizations, and the .
development of programs and activ-
ities for students. . . V

i

         

   “   ationail,

A Also located on the main floor is
the ticket office, which distributes
tickets for campus events, and the
Pitt Program Council (PPC), which
is responsible for most of the
campus-wide program planning.

There are over I00 “recognized
student organizations” at Pitt. These
are ones which.-have submitted a

constitution, membership list, and '

bylaws to the SGB, and in most

cases receive funding through its --

Allocations Committee. -

The student media groups and ‘

organizations are unique in that they
serve as a valuable communication
channel between Pitt students and

“ oirganizations. These groups

include:

Backspace——A , literary , magazine .

published twice a year, featuringthe

work of several writers and artists at

Pitt.

Night Times-—The newspaper of I
the College of General Studies Stu- P

dent Government Association,
which is published twice a month,
and contains, articles of interests to
students enrolled in the College of
General Studies. .

Panther Prints-—The official

O yearbook of Pitt is published each

September.
iPitt News—The official student
newspaper of the university is pub-

lished three times a week during the .

fallrand winter_ terms and once a
week during the spring term.
Members serve as salespeople, writ-

ers, photographers, t'ypists,,produc- .'

tion people, pioofreaders and copy
editors.

WPGH ‘ Radio——A student-
operated radio station, it provides
students with an opportunity to gain
experience in radio broadcasting. ~

Further

will also be available at the Activities
Fair (sponsored by the ' Office of

’' Student Activities) this Sunday
evening from 6 to 9 p.m. The loca-

tion is outdoors between the Forbes
Quad and the pl-Iillman"Library.‘

The stress of schoolwork,combined
with having a total moron for a
roommate can bring out all those
problems involving parents or peers,
emotion-al or social difficulties, mar-
ital conflicts, or concerns about aca-
demic progress or direction.

The Counseling Service can help.
Only one . of the many services
offered by the C & SDC, the Coun-
seling Service employs a large
number of psychologists who are
available to meet ‘with students

' either at the C & SDC’s offices, or at

the_ Student Health Center.
Although students are requested to
either call or stop by for an appoint-
ment, in an emergency, a psycholo-
gist can be made available
immediately. O

Students who aren’t sure why

they’re here, or who are concerned
about. life after graduation, are
encouraged to stop by at the Career
Library, or to make an appointment
with a Career Counselor.

The Placement Center

If its money you need, or just
work experience in your major, the
Part-time and Summer Employ-
ment Office is the place to go. Part of

the University Placement Center, _

jobs range from the technical, such
as ones intended for computer

' science or mechanical engineering

majors, to the non-technical, like
proof-reader or massuese. .It is

located through the double doors at

224 Schenley Hall.

While you’re up there, you might
want to start checking out the Place-
ment Office. Even though students
usually ignore it until their senior
year, the Placement Office is worth
knowing about.

If you have your heart set on
working for IBM when you gradu-
ate, you might want to check out the
Employer Library. Maintained by
the Placement Office, the library is a
permanent file of company publica-
tions, annual reports, and other
information put out by more than
l',200 organizations. Also included
in the library are federal publica-
tions which outline job availability
and job strategies. A few like The
Chronicle of Higher Education and
Federal Jobs, are excellent for keep-
ing an eye on changing job trendsi

The Employer Library also keeps
on file videotapes discussing such
topics as Interviewing Techniques,
Marriage and Careers, and Job

Hunting Tips for N on-technical S tu- “

dents. There are ten tapes in all.
When you’re ready to graduate,
all students should‘ file an applica-

r tion with CATCH, a computerized

retrieval system which allows the

matching up of students with jobs‘ .

outside of the campus interview sys-
tem. Another system, SIGNUP, has
allowed the Placement Office to

    
  
 

/

, , , , , , , . I .

move into the twentieth century. A
computerized system for scheduling
interviews on campus, this innova-
tion has eliminated the lines which
previously occurred as students
spent long nights in the hallway
waiting to nab that good spot on the
interviewing schedule.

The Student
Service

The Student Health Service is
funded and maintained by a manda-
tory health fee all full-time students
are required to pay. So, since you’ve
paid for it, you might as well use it.

Services included in the fee are the
following.

General Medicine is often referred
to as “primary care.” Walk-in
patients will be seen by.a nurse, and
depending upon the severity of the

Health

illness, a physician or nurse practi-
tioner may be called in. Students are
warned, however, that walk-ins will
be attended to as time permits, and
that may take all night. Appoint-
ments are better and quicker.
Gynecology is done in association
with a consulting gynecologist from
Magee-Womens Hospital.

Family Planning provides birth ‘

control, education, counseling and
medical service. All records are kept
confidential, as in all of the student
health services.

Other services included in the
health fee are Internal Medicine,
minor Office Surgery, Dermatol-
ogy, shots for Allergies, Immuniza-

tions, Lab Work, and X-rays when

ordered by an SHS physician.

Services not included in the health
feegare any pharmacy costs and elec-
tive physicals.

' I : i at the l98l commencement. he opened a can ofworms that is,

During commencement. 200 people marched in protest ,
outside the Civic Arena. inside. approximately 40 black  
studentsstood with their backs to the podium as Kirkpatrick gave her address. Later, at a May I l A
meeting of the Senate Council, a controversy arose over whether Posvar had properly followed the
correct procedure in inviting Kirkpatrick.

As a consequence. a special committee was established to screen and develop procedures for the
selection of honorary degree recipients and commencement speakers. While plans for the committee
had been in the works before Kirkpatrick‘s invitation. the controversy over her appearance hastened
its formation. - i

itt Got Shared Services Facility

On July 28. the full board of the Health Systems Agency
gave Children’s Hospital the go-ahead for plans to construct '
a l4-story $l27 million shared-services facility in Oakland.

The new building will provide additional bed space for the a
Children‘s Hospital, as well as laboratory and radiology
facilities for surrounding hospitals.     » .   .   i   ..

Welcome To The

T Almost  

Welcome to Pitt.

Perhaps this phrase is overused. Since you first stated an interest in
attending the University of Pittsburgh, you have probably been inun-
dated with literature welcoming you to it. '

And, you probably have already been informed of what Pitt can
offer you. You’ve seen the statistics, read about the programs, know
thereputation. You know what to expect.

That’s part of preparing for your time at Pitt. But there is more.

Like what not to expect.

—Don’t expect your professors to coddle and coax y'ou'to go to
class and do your homework. They won’t. Most professors don’t even
have an attendance requirement. They expect you to be responsible
enough to handle the course material in whatever way you choose.

—Don’t take that to mean you can make yourself scarce. High
school may have been restrictive, but if midterms roll around and you
haven’t been to class for months, you’ll begin to wish someonehad
slapped a few demerits on you and forced you to go. lt’s a hard lesson
to learn. Just hope you don’t have to repeat it every term.

—Don’t expect to decide on a major right away)». Despite parental
and peer pressure to the. contrary, you don't have to have aidetailed
map of the next 40 years of your life upon entering college. Take your ‘
time. Sample courses you might be interested in so you have a basis on
which to make your final decision.

And don’t be afraid to change your major if you are sure it isn’t right
for you. Otherwise, you may end up as a famous actress chained inside
a nurse’s uniform. \ I -

—Don’t think you canjoin every clu h, group, activity, etc., and still
have time to eat or sleep. Pitt is a massive place. There are over I00
student organizations here. Although you have every opportunity to
become involved in them, keep in mind it’s not like high school, where
you spend an hour after school and the work’s done.

Some are highly specialized groups that require considerable
amounts of time and energy from their members. So look carefully at
what a group does or stands for before you decideto take the plunge.
Once you see the kind of commitment it takes, you might realize a
picture in the yearbook is small compensation. ’ " ’

—Don’t assume you haven't got a voice at Pitt. OK,so there are

- 34,000 other students and you thinktyou’re just another pretty face.

Not exactly. If you don’t like what the administration or the student

government board or the campus media are doing, let them know. Let

everybody know. Run for SGB, write a letter to the editor,,organize
people who hold your point of view. '

This is not to say anything will necessarily change-—sometimes you
can't fight Pitt‘s version of city hall either—but you do have the
opportunity to try. And who know? If you yell loud enough, some-
body’s bound to hear you...

—Don’t expect your education to guarantee you a job upon gradua-
tion. Hey, we can't all be engineers. It's a tough world out there, and
no one will be" sending you invitations. lt’s not like IBM interviews
fiction writers for jobs, you understand? But then again, not every-
thing you learn can be written in a resume. Hopefully, in your four
years here you’ll give yourself the chance to explore your own possibil-
ities and limitations. You should expect that_m_uch1_ 0

The Pitt News, ‘Friday, August 29,198I_

Column

By ROBERT FIRTH
and
FRED KOLOC

Students often enter college with
the notion that they’re about to be
supplied with four,’ years of
answers——molecular structures and
grammatical rules, integration for-
mulas and economic theories. And
being thus supplied, they can go out

_ and be employed.

What these students don’t realize

is that the “answers" are tangential y

’ To be a freshman again. What an

experience! It is a time for meeting
new friends, getting lost «and con-C

fused, getting used to being away
from home probably for the first
time, partying, and of course.learn-
ing to study the college way vs. the
high school way. ‘  '

' The freshrnan year..can be both a .

positive and negative "experience!
There are events which will cause the
new student to thoroughly enjoy his

"or her first year at college, and of

course things will occurthat could
bring’ disappointments. The ‘latter
may occur’ through
beyond the, student’s control, and
some of them will be _created.by the
student.

In an effort to keep new students
from starving or otherwise dying
of boredom, The Pitt News wel-
comes each of you with the 1981
edition of “A Freshman’s Guide to
-Oakland.” We would suggest that
‘you cut this out and post it on your
brand new bulleting board, just in
case you happen to find time from

your studies to eator otherwise

enjoy yourself. Every effort was
made to make this as complete as

possible, so here it is:_Oaklandiafs

For those of ‘you with a few dol-
lars in your pocket and an itch to get
an immediate taste of college life.
this isjust for you. The grand tour of
Oakland’s famed Restaurant" Row,
that inexpensive gallery of ham-
burgers and french fries. There is a
Burger Chef located "in the basement
of the cathedral. a Burger King on
the corner of Fifth and Oakland. a
Wendy's on the corner of Fifth and

On Forbes Avenue there are two
fast food places per block. There is
an Arby’s across from the Giant

For the student lucky enough to
have a few bucks, Oakland offers a
variety of_ finer restaurants with cui-
sine ranging from Fench to Greek to
American.

ney’s, both on Forbes Avenue. are
just a few steps away from the Tow-
ers. The restaurants offer sand-

wiches and salads at a moderate
price and are usually filled at lunch
time. Further down. on Atwood
Street, there is the Black Angus
which serves Greek and American

 
  

dishes. its prices ranges from mod-
erate to expensive. The Cornucopia
specializes in natural and vegetarian
foods and is moderately priced.

For those who can’t seem‘to get
away from the cafeteria, there is also
a place for you. Someplace Special,
on Atwood Street, has a cafeteria-

There is also a deli and a special

So now you know what you
can get on burger row, and where
to find a cheap movie, 'but'let’s
talk about some serious informa-
tion: where. to drink. Face it,
after you have paid your bill and
found your room, you are proba-
bly ready to hoist a few cold
ones. As you look over the
tangled neon expanse that is
Forbes Ave., you might scratch
your head and wonder where a
decent hardworking, somewhat
debaucherous person like your-
self can grab a d_raft without get-
ting killed, or spending all that
crisp green dad gave you before
you left home. '

Well, what college zone would
be complete without at least a
few accomodating enterprises
dedicated to" the worship of’Bac-
chus? Pitt is no exception. There
are literally dozens of taverns,
bars, discos, and dives available
for an earnest young student to
acquire an education in life and
quench his thirst at the same
time. Below -is a series ofthumb-
nail sketches of the most note-
worthy haunts in the Oakland
area.

nishings,-.« piped music, stained

located near the “O" on Forbes

On
Atwood Street there are two, the

these restaurants ‘do not

Two types of “fmer"cuisine,espe—
cially for the college student, are in
erratic supply here in Oakland. They.
are the Chinese restaurant and the
classic deli. Perhaps the best place
for your money in the Chinese div-

cum:-:  

its happy hour, which actually
runs from 4:00 p.m. until 7:00
p.m., at which time drinks and
drafts are half price. i
P,eter’s Pub: Located on Oak-
land Avenue, it is a hang-out for
the college elite: football players‘
and the alligator‘ shirt" crowd. '
Decor is on the woody side,
drinks reasonable. T ‘ V
Sanctuary: Oakland ’s hot spot

- for disco; in fact, it is about the

only spot for disco this sideiofe
downtown. On weekends there is
a $1.00 cover, and drinks are in
the moderate price range. An ele-
vated dance floor providesa uni-
que view—bumps and grinds
included at no extra charge.

Zelda’s Greenhouse: Fern -bar,
on the expensive side, a great
pick-up spot for people who
don’t do that sort of thing.
Located behind the _“O” on
Bouquet. _

‘Pitt Tavern: English Depart-
ment hang-out on the corner of .
Fifth and Bouquet. ' .-

Danny’s: This is a great place
to go if you want to get away
from college kids. Classic corner
bar: TV, juke box, video games, ..
cheap beer. Located on Oakland

like something out of San Francisco

Every student needs a break from
studying once in a while. Oakland

_ has a wide variety of play time activi-

ties. For the culture-minded there is
the Carnegie Museum of Natural
History and Art. The museum is
open seven days a week and there is a
small admission fee. On Saturdays,
however, admission is free to the
public. Soldiers and Sailors Memor-
ial Hall also has an exhibit of war
memorabilia. it is located on Fifth

For the. less culture-oriented,
there are other activities to while

After all. if the Bronx has a street
filled \&‘i.th.llower shops. and Phila-
delphia’s got a row ofjevvclry stores.
then Oakland can claim its section of
Forbes Avenue as a junk food
haven.

No one from the Original Hot

“Hey my man." a security guard
says to guy in gym shorts who has

just put a nine-pack of beer down

and is tr_ving to buy another. "You
got to take this outside."

The guard. at six-footer with corn-

When the gu_v protests. claiming
somebody will steal it if he leaves it

And that. Thomas sa_vs. is one of

“In the day. it‘s pretty quiet." he
says. “But at night. sometimes peo-

Thomas has been working at the
‘‘0'‘ for two-and—a—half months. He

ing in Public Administration.

Burnett also travels to the “O“ for

says. The “O”dog is one ofthe Origi-

one. it only takes a minute. They put
anything on top of it. from cheese to
chili. Plus. it costs a little over a

Also very popular at the “O“ are
the weekly beer specials. where a cer-

Life In The Crowded Lane

By REGINA KVlTKOVlCH

You’re finally at Pitt. Your par-
ents drove off a couple of hours ago.
leaving you “alone" with the 40-odd
strangers who will be your floor-
mates. You're standing (there‘s no
place to sit) in the middle of boxes,
faced with arranging your room and
your life for the next year. You can
only pray that the Olivia Newton-
John's Greatest Hits album on top
of your roommate’s record pile is a
joke.

Welcome to the Pitt residence
halls. ‘

Apprehensive about dorm life?To
take some of the shocks out of the
coming months. here is a preview of
the best and worst things about liv-
ing in the dorms.

Starting atthe bottom. here is the
worst thing about dorm life: com-

" munal bathrooms. Don‘t try to kid
yourself. saying you‘ll get used to it.
Unless you grew up in a'Greyhound
bus station, you won't. Ever.

Of course, there's little privacy
anywhere in the dorms. When two
people are livinginaspacethe size of
your dad’s Oldsmobile, something
has to go. Look at it this way: your
roommate may be a stranger now,
but he or she won’t be for long. After
two weeks together in a Towers
room, you’ll know more than you'll
want to. about each other.

So much for the worst of dorm
life. What about the best. you ask‘?
Surprisingly. the best things all stem
from the-worst. Sure there’s little
privacy, but you’ll never get to know

more. and different kinds of, people-

anywhere else in college.

For the most part. you‘re now out
from under your parents‘ roof and
away from your old high school
social set. Dorm life provides you
with a chance to grow independent.
You‘ll developvyour own preferences
and rules.

It will be hard at first. Every fresh-
man occasionally makes mistakes
such as trying to survive on four
hours of sleep per_night. Or ordering
the quiche in the Towers cafeteria
food line. Later you’ll realize that
every mistake helps you to learn
more. P A

You'll also gain new outlooks on

the world. Wait until you make your

first trip to Thrift Drug or Giant

Eagle. You‘ll suddenly unders_tand
what your parents meant all these
years when they talked about
inﬂation.

You may have thought you came
to Pitt just to learn engineering or
nursing. But inthe process, you'll
learn more about yourself. and life
in general. than you ever will in a
classroom".

He doesn't mind the hours. and
doesn't the belligerent customers.
“lt’s understandable if they‘re
drunk." he says. He likes the chal-
lenge of keeping them happy. He
likes his job. despite the noise and
the drunks. Despite the odds. _
But why’? What's the big attrac-
tion‘? When you first walk in the

place it looks like a poor imitation of

a ’50s snack shop. How could any-
body possibly Iike it‘? P

Maybe for the reasons that Rich
Kelly and some friends are sitting at
a table. drinking a few beers. 'l‘hey‘re

The question is whether youth
and enthusiasm can beiany substi-
tute for NFL-grade talent and
proven game experience. The chal-
lenge for the Pitt Panther football
team, and not least of all, Head
Coach Jackie Sherrill, is proving the
heights of the national rankings can
be had with a large‘ group of new-
found starters.

“We’ve lost some great, great
players,” conceded Sherrill, paying
homage to the l5"starters gone from
last year’s second-ranked ll-l
squad. “But, our young people can
bevery good. its their turn to come

up.”

Dwight Collins, and offensive line-
men Emil Boures and Jimbo

himself, is junior defensive tackle .

John Hendrick. _ However, Hen-
drick’s “ fragile left knee, "which
underwent a rebuilding ofsorts a_fter

he tore ligaments in Pitt’s second

game last season, could change the
-situation. ’ =
“The doctors told me l had some
of the worst surgeryyou can have,”
Hendrick said. “The knee is still
sore, but l was told to expect that."l
just want to get through the season.
We waited two years. its my turn."
Still, as recentlyas last week, the
knee was limiting the 6-6, 265 pound

tackle’s practice time, a problem”-

that furrows Sherrill’s brow and has

him contemplating moving heavily

everything at Penn Hills High
School, from offense‘ into Hen-
drick’s defensive tackle slot. i

As for the rest of the defense, the
most oft-heard word is “rebuilt,

..
..

land the battle for starting slots is

generating an atmosphere of enthu-
siam missing from recent camps,
when most positions were set. Still,
the success of the rebuilding effort
will depend on how quickly Sherrill
and defensive coordinator Foge
Fazio can make the unit cohesive. '

“lt’s aﬂchallenge. We have to stay
healthyand put things together in a
hurry,” said Sherrill,‘ who plans to
spend a lot of time at fall camp
teaching technique. “Our biggest
concern is how quickly our defensive
team gets competitive. . . I shouldn’t
say that. I know we’ll be competi-
tive. its just a big question mark

. how quickly.they’re going to come.”

To hasten their arrival, Sherrill
_and Fazio will be making some con-

cessions to youth. Fazio plans to cut

down the number and complexity of

defensive alignments and schemes \

the_ team will use this year. He
warned, “We’ll have to work‘ like
crazy on pass defense.”

Sherrill said theoffense will _feel
the ripple effects of the young

defense, too. “Ogffensively, we’ll cut."

back,” Sherrill said. “We won’t be as

reckless because our defense won't ‘

allow us to.” ' - .

j After being the main architect of.
the nation’s No. l defense last year,
Fazio approaches this year’s task
more philosophically.

“I compare myself to that great
sculptor,
Michaelangelo, as he climbed the

ladder, looking at the ceiling of the C

Sistinechapel, and said, ‘What the
hell did l get myself into?’,” Fazio

, joked. If Fazio’s work even approxi-

Hit and MISS
Pitt Just Misses Playoffs P
But Graduation Hits Hard

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Sports Editor

"It came in the form ofa late night
phone call. An obscene phone call, if
you’re Pitt baseball coach Bobby
Lewis.

ln a season of few setbacks, a sea-
son in which the Panther baseball
team rolled to its best record ever, at
25-8, a phone call informing Lewis
that the Panthers did not receive the
NCAA tournament at-large bid they
had hoped for-brought the 1981 sea-
son, TH E season of Bobby Lewis‘27
at Pitt, to an abrupt close. _
A How good a year was it? How
about Pitt baseball’s best ever.
At the season’s end, six Pitt start-
ers finished with .300-plus batting
averages, and one, senior first base-
iman Rich Kline, finished with a .429
mark, 21st in the NCAA.

Teaming up with the potent hit-
ting line—up_was a starting pitching
staff studded with four workhorses
with a penchant for complete games.
The Panthers’ four starters, Allen
Lachowicz, Larry LaMonde, Mike
Luciow and Aaron Krause,
accounted for all 25 Pitt wins and
stepped aside so rarely that‘ at the
season’s end, Pitt’s three relief
pitchers had amassed a total ofjust
l0-plus innings pitched.

And on the sidelines, enjoying it
all was Lewis, who picked up his
300th victory, a career milestone,
against Carnegie-Mellon at midsea-
son, courtesy of Luciow and the first
of his two no-hitters last year. After
all his years as Pitt head coach,
Lewis said, after the 300th victory,

' that he’ll keep on coaching as long as

\

he’s welcome.

“With my love for Pitt, they’ll
probably have to cut the uniform off
of me,” Lewis said laughing.

But mention graduation", and you
can bet Lewis will wince, not smile.
Seven Panthers completed their
four—year stint at Pitt, including
three-fourths" of Lewis’ starting
infield.—Kline, shortstop and
former team MVP Marc Massa and
third baseman Chris Mihalik. Also
gone is Luciow, reliever Tim Moran,
catcher Jim Pastin and outfielder
Rich Fenoglietto.

Add would-be seniors Lachowicz
and LaMonde to the list ofgoners as‘
the team en-ters 1982. V

' Lachowicz, a~ strapping 6-3 fire-
balling righthander, was the Texas
Rangers’ No. l pick in the June
draft. Last season, Lachowicz went
7-3 for the Panthers, with a l.40
ERA and 75 strikeouts in just 63
innings, both sixth in the NCAA. ,
. “Allen has the talent, desire and
dedication to go all the way to the

_ majors,” said Lewis. Lachowicz also

doesn’t hurt his chances either.

year for Pitt’s Pantherette volleyball
team, and once the results are in
from the squad’s current swing
through the West, it may bemore
than numbers that point towards a

: regional championship and a crack
-at national prominence.

With the return of five veteran
starters, and the addition of two
promising first-year players, the

trail toward the majors, LaMonde
ﬂoated in the back door, thanks to
his knuckleball. The Pittsburgh
Pirates made LaMonde their 2lst
round selection in the draft, prompt-
ing LaMonde to call the chance “a
dream come true.”

“Larry was kind ofoverlooked...a
well-kept secret,” said Jon Neiderer,
the Pirate’s assistant scouting direc-
tor. “He’s got a real good knuckle-
ball. With that pitch, you’ve got to
give him a chance to make it to the
big leagues.”

But, it’s been said one man’sjoy is
another man's sorrow.‘ The loss of
nine key players leaves Lewis count-
ing heavily on some returning regu-
lars as well as some contributions
from some incoming players.

“We were devastated," said Lewis
in reference to the nine losses.
“Graduation really took its toll. You
don’t replace the type of players we
lost every day. We have a lot of
rebuilding to do.”

With three-fourths of his pitching
sophomore Aaron
Krause returns as Lewis’ ace among
the starting pitchers. The 6-4 right-
hander was 7-0 last year and often
caught the eye of the major league
scouts when they weren’t studying
Lachowicz.

“We’ll have to rebuild our pitch-
ing staff, and I hope some of our
young people can step in and work
in somewhere,” Lewis said. “Jim
Cosgrove has been pitching very
well this summer in the Federation
League, so we’ll see how he does this
fan." ‘ ‘

Lewis also cited-the rebuilding of
the Panther infield as‘ his other
major challenge this year. “We have
a lot_of work to do’, and we‘ll try a lot
of people there. Fitzpatrick will be
back, and Jon Adams, who backed
up at third last season, is back,”

Lewis said. “We’ll also be looking at-

some new people to step into the
infield.”

The Panthers appearto bein good
shape for i982 in the outfield with
returning starters Doug Steiner
(.333) and Darrell Gissendanner
(.346), Pitt’s third and fourth top

hitters last year. i '

“This fall is going to be a key time

for us," Lewis said. “We hope to.

come out of fall camp with a ball

. club. lt’s gonna be a'young club and

this fall will be a lot of work, but
that’s thechallenge.”

More often than not, Lewis has
met challenges.«ln his nearly three
decades at Pitt, he’s had only three
seasons below.500.

Looking ahead to fall camp and
next season, Lewis’ says, “I can’t

Shirk Leads Life Outside Gymnastic

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
Sports Editor

As a gymnast, Pitt sophomore
Lisa Shirk is a rigid conformist,
exercising her routines precisely

enough to finish second in the all- '

around at last spring‘s Association
for Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women (AIAW) National
Championships.

Out of the gym, Lisa Shirk is...uh,
“different”.

“I wouldn’t call her crazy,” said
sophomore teammate Karen Mar-
tin, one of Shirk’s closer friends. “I
guess you could say she’s a free
spirit.”

For instance? How about the out-
fit Shirk wears over her Pantherette

uniform between events during"

meets—a blue nylon parka with a
fur-trimmed hood, a blue-and-gold
scarf, an oversized natty green
sweater and bright red wool tights.

‘‘I also have a pair of argyle
tights,” said Shirk.

Shirk said she bundles up in the
outfit to keep warm while she’s not
competing, to avoid tearing any
muscles in a meet.

“ “I’m sure that’s part of it,” Martin
said, “but I think she just enjoys
being different.”

Different enough to earn the nick-
name “Bag Lady”, which came from
Shirk’s roommate, Karen Bell, last
fall, soon after Shirk started her fre-
quent late—night jaunts to to other
dormitory floors.

“Lisa would go around and rum-
mage through the trash, and bring
back signs, pictures and other neat
junk,” Bell said. “Once we made a
collage on our wall with all the stuff
she brought back. She even found
some recipes.”

Which shatters another stereo-
type: the dainty little gymnast whose
diet consists mainly of three plump
strawberries for breakfast, lunch

and dinner.

Shirk loves to bake—she some-
times stays up all night baking while
her friends stay awake all night
studying—although Shirk insists
(coach, are you listening?) she only
bakes for her friends.

“I don’t eat any of it,” Shirk said.
“Well, not much anyway.”

Shirk’s specialty is her low-cost
chocolate chip cookie recipe. It’s low
cost because she buys very few of the
ingredients. First, there's the sugar.
Shirk calculated it would take 3,000
packets, the kind found in fast food
restaurants, to fill the cookie recipe.

‘‘It comes to about 480 packets a
cup,” said Shirk, who gathered and
counted the packets until she had the

Then there were the eggs. After
“acquiring” a few eggs after a dorm
breakfast and slipping them into her
coat pocket, Shirk went to biology
class and forgot all about them.
Until she sat down.

“I sat through the whole hour-
and-20 minute class with egg seeping
through my pockets,” Shirk said,
laughing. “I didn’t want anyone to
notice if I got up and walked out
with egg running down my leg. So I
just waited until class was over.”

Shirk has done some other note-
worthy things, but some of her
tamer antics include taking bites out
of food in the cafeteria line and put-
ting it back on the shelf—her friends

call her the John Belushi of the
cafeteria. She’s alsogood at starting
food fights.

“We got a standing ovation for
one of our ﬁghts,” Bell said.

‘‘I’ve had to cut down on some of
the stuff,” Shirk confessed. “We’ve
been yelled at a few times.”

At least Shirk hasn’t cut down on
her antics in the gym, picking up at
Pitt where she left off as a prep
school star. ,

Before arriving at Pitt, Shirkwas
already a four—year veteran of the
U.S. national team and a veteran of
high-level international competi-

_tions in France, Bulgaria, London

and Moscow. A chronic stress frac-
ture in her leg prevented Shirk from

trials, where she had a good chance
of earning a spot on the team.
After considering national power-
houses like Utah and UCLA, Shirk
chose Pitt to be closer to her family
in Connecticut. She also sought to

attend a school that didn’t have a _

large-scale program, like a UCLA.
“I didn’t want to go to the bigger
gymnastics schools because there is
so much pressure on you to pro-
duce,” Shirk said. “It’s like you pro-
duce and worry about your carcass

later. I wanted to go to school and A

have a life outside gymnastics.”
Inside or outside gymnastics,
Shirk ranks well beyond the norm.

Expeﬁence
Helps in ’82

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
Sporls Editor‘

For the first time in Pitt men’s
gymnastics history, three members
of the Panther team qualified for the
NCAA National Championships
-last season, capping perhaps the
most successful year ever for the Pitt
squad. ’

The Panther team finished 8-3
and returns all three national quali-
fiers, plus a seasoned supporting
cast that creates optimism about this
year’s team’s chance of improving
on their l980-8l No. 5 Eastern
ranking. -

Back are senior Bob Besong and
sophomore Dave Smith, who both
qualified for Nationals in the floor
exercise last season, and sophomore
Frank Kratz, who competed in the
vault, averaging an impressive 9.53
in the event last year. After an out-'
standing season, Besong narrowly
missed qualifying in two other
events-the high bar and the all-
around.

Also returning are the Femiani
brothers—Joe, a senior, and Chris, a
junior who joins Besong in giving
the Panthers a high-scoring one-two
punch in the all-around. Both Chris
and Joe are coming off injury-
plagued seasons. and Pitt Coach
Frank D’Am_ico expects even better
things from both gymnasts this year.

Other key returnees includejunior ~
ring and high-bar specialist, Dave
Shandelman, senior “Nooch”
Capani on the pommel horse, and
junior Brian Balk in the floor exer-
cise and vault.

With the loss of only two regular
performers, Jeff Litzinger and
Byron Johns, to graduation, D'Ami-
co‘s team seems to be‘ in good shape
to resume another assault on the Pitt
team scoring record of 255.2, which
the Panthers established last season
before a crowd of 6,800 at Penn
State, the nation’s then sixth-ranked

team and No. I ‘squad in the East.
“We lack the depth that Penn
State had, but this season looks
good for us when Penn State visits
here at Pitt-,” D’Amico said. “We
lose two gymnasts, but hopefully
we’ll be bringing in some good pros-
pects. The meet here could be close.”
Last season, the Pitt team set a
number of precedents in its rise
toward the top of the East. Besides

establishing a new team scoring-

record, the three-man contingent
that competed at Nationals last year
were the first gymnast-s to qualify for
Nationals in D‘Amico’s four-year
Pitt tenure.

“I think we were a bit nervous
during the meet, which probably

" .:-~'«-'-,‘~<'-: ‘."‘f.'..K"3Ti7'_§'3_1{l?’.J 

affected us more than anything,”
D’Amico said. “But, hopefully, next
year when we get there, we’ll know
what to expect.”

Notice D’Amico isn’t saying “if”
we get there. It's “when". As_
D’Amico says, “We’d liketo go back
next year and bring back some
hardware.”

Toward East Top

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
"Sports Editor

Sometimes it's not so bad for girls
to have a reputation—-when-it comes
to gymnastics. .

. The l4th-ranked Pitt Pantherette
gymnastics team entered last year’s

Association for Intercollegiate -

Athletics for Women. (AIAW)
National Championships hoping to
continue building its national pres-
tige in the head-to-head competition
against the top teams and individual
performers in the country.

Not that the Pantherette’s reputa-
tion was that bad. The team entered
Nationals ranked llth and second in
the East, with a sparkling ll-l dual
meet record and team scoring aver-
age, as well as the nations’s.eventual
No. 2 all-around gymnast, L_isa
Shirk. Pitt’s only loss last year came

in the team's final meet against Penn.
State, then the nation's No. 2 team. .

At Nationals, last April at the
University of Utah, only an off-night
on the balance beam, Pitt’s nemesis
at the Eastern Regionals as well, pre-

vented the Pantherettes from’finish- _

ing in thetop 10 instead ofthe team’s
l2th-place finish.

At the AIAW Eastern Regionals,
hosted by Pitt, the Pantherettes were
actually leading Penn State at the
mid-way point of the meet, but lost
the edge as five of the six Pitt gym-

nasts competing on the beam suf-.

fered major breaks in their routines.
Still, Pitt Coach Donna Sanft
feels the Pantherettes‘ show at East-

    

ern and Nationals, earned some
added respect for the Pitt team,
establishing them right behind Penn
State at the top of Eastern
gymnastics. .

“After beating them at halftime at
Regionals, I don’t think Penn State
can ever take us lightly again,"Sanft
said. “We’ve been building our pro-
gram in their shadow all these years.
But nowthat we’ve been to Nation-
als twice, we’re starting to move out
of that shadow.” V

And while she downplayed the
importance of winning the head-to-
head showdown each year in favor
of a high team ‘scoring average that
goes toward qualifying a team for
Nationals, Sanft joked, “this is my
eighth year coming up, and _I am
getting tired of getting beat.”-

Sanft can take solace in the fact it

doesn’t happen too often. The Pan- '

therettes‘don"t figure to slip much
this season, despite the loss of four
gymnasts to ‘graduation, thanks to a

1981 team Sanft calls “the strongest
returning team we’ve ever had.”

A Gone are last year’s co-captains
Myra Bachuchin and Bonnie
Tressler, and Diane Debich and

Back are last year’s freshman sen-
sations Lisa‘Shirk and Karen Mar-
tin and fellow All-East performer

“There's strength in numbers,”
claims Pitt Soccer Head Coach Leo
Bemis, who has lured 28 recruits to
this year’s Pitt Panther team.

The recruits will join 22 returning
players, including ll lettermen and
one junior-college transfer, to pre-
pare for this year’s season opener
September 9 against Gannon.

The Panthers are coming off a
strange and disappointing l98l sea-
son. Going into the first week in
October, Pitt was 7-2 and looking
forward to postseason play. But.
after a nine-day layoff, Pitt returned
to face a strong Bethany team and
lost, 3-l. In many ways, it was the
beginning of the end. _

Beginning with the Bethany game,
the Panther booters went on to lose
their last six games, as their scoring
attack almost deserted them and
their record dropped to a disheart-
ening 7-8.

Even though the l980 season
didn‘t turn out as well as they hoped,
the Panthers proved last spring they
could rebound and work as a team,
playing extremely well and winning
several tournaments during the
indoor season. And, with some key

players returning, there‘s renewed
hope for the upcoming season.

Junior Eric Tiedtke returns at his
winger position to help out with that
all-important scoring attack.
Tiedtke finished last season with 7
goals and 3 assists, good enough to
put him near the top in the league
scoring standings. Joining Tiedtke
in the league top 10 in scoring were
Panthers Bob Hughes and Troy
Norton.

Senior Scott Thunberg returns
this year in the net for the Panthers
after a standout l980 season. Play-
ing goalie last season, Thunberg had
four shutouts, just two short of
breaking the Pitt season record.

Senior Al Adelmann once again

mans the midfield, adding his good »

ball handling, scoring touch and
experience to this year's team. Also
returning is Jim Hackworth andjun-
ior Tom Trempus, two oflast year’s
starters known for their quickness
and strength. -

Bemis admitted he has been look-
ing for goal scorers in the off-season
to strengthen the Panther offensive
attack, which grew weak down the
stretch last season.

“I tried to stress goal scoring and
finishing the attack when this

‘ recruiting year came around," said

Bemis. “We need the people who are

It was a season in which injuries
took their toll on the Pitt track team,
but it was the strength ofa few fine
individual performances that sal-
vaged some success for the Panther
trackmen this past spring.

If there was any hope for national
prominence for Pitt, it was to be in
junior jumper Larry Kinney, who
gained All-America status during
the i980 indoor season and qualified
for a spot in the NCAA champion-
ships in June. .

A hamstring injury plagued Kin-
ney all season, however, and he was
forced to sit out the NCAA outdoor
championships—making only two
meet appearances since the April 23
Penn Relays.

Injuries also played, havoc with
Pitt runners, and may have pre-

phia, from qualifying for Nationals.
Gallagher was spiked duringthe
Penn State lnvitational in May, and

missed qualifying for the
nationals——a feat he nearly accom-
lished last year, missing byjust two-
tenths of a second.

The best news for the running
effort comes in the potential ofju-
nior Darryl Baynes, who’s expected
to develop into a strong middle-
distance runner. The sprinter from
Philadelphia turned in a |:53.7 for
the 800-meter run in the Central
Collegiates in only his first attempt
at that distance in competition.

indicatingihis goal of a 1:43 800 this
season. Baynes expects to concen-
trate on 800-meter competition,
with an occasional drop down to the
sprints. He will also continue his

first-leg position on the mile relay 8

team.

The Panthers lost only three
seniors through graduation-
distance runners Randall Bailey of
New Castle and Robert Landstrom
of McKeesport and Pitt record-
holding pole vaulter Eugene Roach
of Washington, Pa.

With the return of a healthy Kin-
ney, stronger performances by Mit-
ton, the new discovery of Baynes, an
intact mile relay team, and the addi-
tion of transfer Bill Moorhead (3:47
in the 1500-meters), things look
promising for Agostinella and the
Pitt trackmen in I982.

Losing TitleDampens Season

By JOHNETTE HOWARD:
Sports Editor

If one of the fruits of success is
collecting the spoils, one of the
drawbacks may be getting spoiled in
the process. _ V

Sounds confusing? It is, consider-
ing the attitude ofthe highly'success-
ful Pitt Pantherette women’s'swim
team (9-1), which,’ down tothe last
freestyler, characterize their l98l
season as a “disappointment”, des-

pitegqualifying the team’s largest,

contingent ever for the'AIAW
Nationals and returning from the
meet with six All-Ame/ica
swimmers.”

The major cause for the dissatis-
faction is the team’s narrow loss to
defending Eastern champ Princeton
at last year’s Eastern regional meet,
where the outcome was not decided
until the last relay. Even though the
Pantherettes set four meetirecords‘
and a slew of Pitt records, swam
below the national qualifying cutoff

A times in 14 of 24 events—qualifying

all five relays in the process, and sent
the team‘s first diver ever to Nation-
als (the East’s sole representative)-

. it wasn’t good enough for them.

“I wasn’t surprised at Pitt’s finish,
but we still didn’t swim as well as I
had anticipated," said Coach_Dick
Bradshaw, who then stepped down
after I2 years of guiding consistent

.. Top 20 teams to finish up his Ph.D.

 

and to accept a Pitt administrative
post. ,

A Bradshaw's successor _ is Dave
Belowich, head coach at South Flor-
ida last season after an assistant

coaching stint at Florida State Uni-’

versity. According to Belowich, Pitt

“Before, we were just trying to

Pitt Siphons Talent, 6t

Not only has the Pitt Panther
swim team managed to drown out its
best competition in the pool in the
wake of its six consecutive Eastern
titles, but it looks like Coach Fred
Lewis has succeeded in drowning
out his rivals’ recruiting efforts in
Pennsylvania as well.

Lewis has signed a nine-man bat-
tery of recruits for next year that
includes six high school All-
Americas, plus three other top local
swimmers. They willjoin a returning
team that should likely extend Pitt‘s
strong hold on the East’s No. l posi-
tion, despite the loss of four key per-
formers from last years 8-3 team.
Back for their senior seasons are
Rick Carter and Sandy Pidgeon,
two—thirds of the entire East's three-
man group of swimmers that quali-
fied for the NCAA Nationals last
season. Carter and Pidgeon won five
conference titles between them.

Pidgeon primarily a breast-
stroker, placed in five events at
Regionals, winning two and qualify-
ing for Nationals in the 200-yard
breaststroke despite being weakened
by a late—season virus. Pidgeon won
the regional meet’s Outstanding
Swimmer Award and went on tojust
miss placing at Nationals.

Carter won two individual events
at Easterns and placed in athird, the
two wins giving him nine conference
titles in his three-year Pitt career.
Both wins, in the 50- and l00—yard
freestyle events, besides qualifying
him for Nationals, were also confer-
ence records. At Nationals, Carter
failed to place in a glamour field
studded with former Olympians and
national champions.

“The quality and speed of this
year's meet surpassed any other on

record.” said Lewis, who attributed ‘

the toughness ofthe meet to the boy-
cott of the 1980 summer games in
Moscow. “You know it was fast
when to make All—America in the
50-yard freestyle, you had to break
the current national record.”

Of Pitt’s four performers that
went to Nationals, only senior diver
Pat Greenwell returned with All-
America honors. Greenwell, com-

peting on both the one- and
three-meter boards, took l2th on the
one-meter to become All-America,

h Crown

and finished l6th on the three-
meter.

Pitt’s other diver, Mike Minik,
did not place on the one-meter
board after winning the event at
Easterns and capturing the meet’s
Outstanding Diver Award. Minik, a
junior, returns as Pitt’stop diverthis
season and intends on earning
another trip to Nationals.

Other key returnees for the Pan-
thersjinclude Eastern 200-yard indi-
vidual medley champ Scott Shearer,
baekstroker Greg Pelton, John
Waldman, Mike Lehto, John
McCrillis, Jerry Zaleski and diver
Bob Lambert. All boast at least a
share of a victory or a top-three fin-
ish from last year's Easterns, as Pitt
swept to l3 wins in the I8 regional
events.

Gone are Greenwell, distance spe-
cialist Jeff Trew, and standout back-
stroker Stu Swanson, a group Lewis
called “the backbone of last year’s
team.” But with the arrival of the
freshmen recruits, Lewis feels the
Panther team can improve on last
year’s finish.

The six All-Americas whojoin the
Panthers this fall are: Dave Lezek
and Greg Murphy of swimming
power Kiski Prep, Shawn McClain,
George LaNoue, a two-time state
champ last year, Ed Bergan and
Doug Condon.

Out of the mountain of individ-
ual, state and national honors the
group has won, perhaps the most
impressive is the fact that Bergan, a
current member of the Pitt Aquatic
Club, has already turned in times
faster than some collegiate All-
America performers. It‘s stats like
that which have Lewis looking for-
ward to his incoming class.

“Individually, there is some great
talent in this group. I expect a lot of
these guys to step in and help us right
away,” Lewis said. “We’ve always
had a lot of great individual pe'r—
formers in recent years, but we've
needed depth. These kids should
help us gain some points at
NCAA’s.” _

Not to mention a few more East-
ern titles.

NWIT Highlightof Stellar Season

Continued from page twenty-eight’

slim 45—42iedge. But, by the 3:38
mark. Penny Welsh hit both ends of
a one-and-one, and Pitt had a 75-73
lead. With only 50 seconds remain-
ing, a Pam Miklasevich jumper put
the Pantherettes up, 80-76, to ice the
victory. '

Lewis, the Pantherettes’ 5-3 play-
making point guard, entered her
junior season with l,054 career
points and finished with I477, just

two points shy of the Pantherette ‘

all—time career scoring record set by
Wanda Randolph in I976 through
I979. lt was yet another highlight in
a spectacular season.

Even though this year’s schedule
includes five of- last year’s top 20
teams, Coach Saurer should be in
excellent shape, withstrong recruit-
ing in the off-season and the return
of several top players. .

Gail Aughburns, the Pantherettes
6-3 center, will be back, as well as 6-0
forward Pam Miklasevich and
guards Lewis and Dugan. Augh-
burns, Lewis and Dugan will be
seniors, and Miklasevich a junior.

Also returning are Lynn Love,
Lori Arent and Beth Tarasi, strong
performers off the bench for Coach
Saurer in l98l. I

The Pantherettes lost just one
player, sharpshootingi guard" Lori
Dolby to graduation. but two Pan-
therette guards. Sue Ko7.iol and
Penny Welsh transferred from Pitt
to Cleveland St. and Connecticut
respectivley. apparently over dis-
agreements with Saurer‘s coaching
philosophy.

Welsh, an NWIT All-America.
was the Pantherettes‘ third-leading

scorer with a l2.3 average. Koziol
appeared in 22 games last season,
with a l.0 average.

Saurer will have five recruits that
figure to give depth to the Pan-
therette squad as it shoots for its
third consecutive 20-win season.

Heading the list is transfer Jen-
nifer Bruce. Bruce comes to Pitt via
Tennessee Tech, where a knee injury
stopped here from playing her fresh-
man year. A

Rounding out the group are cen-
ter LaRochelle Daniels, forward
Lori Lewman, from Mariottsville.

coming season is to improve our

diately,” Saurer said. “I believe we
have acquired solid, fundamental
players." ‘

With the core ofthe talent return-
ing, and the depth and rebounding
strength provided by the recruits, it
could be another successful season
for Saurer and the Pantherettes.

Men ‘s, Women's

  Tennis Teams
Join Forces

By MARIE HUFF

Pin News Sporlswriler

After the completion of the I980
women's tennis season last fall, the
Pitt men‘s and women’s tennis pro-
grams were combined under the
leadership of Coach George Dief-
fenbach, who was named program
coordinator, as well as head coach
for both teams. Assisting Dieffen-
bach will be Fran Webster, who
served as the women’s head coach in
1980.

“Our immediate goal,” explained
Dieffenbach, “is to qualify several
men and women for national com-
petition. We hope that by coordinat-
ing the programs; we will have a
better chance of attaining our goals,
and making each team more
competitive."

The Pantherettes will be trying to
improve on a 5-7 record that could
easily have been a 7-5 record. Pitt
lost matches to Kent State and
Slippery Rock by 5-4 scores. They
also played rivals West Virginia,
Penn State. and Rutgers in close
matches, losing 6-3 in each.

The young Pantherette team will
be back almost intact. Randi Belkin,
last year’s No. l player, will be back,
as well as Cathy Jacobson, the No.2
player. Together, Belkin and Jacob-

,son were an almost unbeatable team

in the No. I doubles slot. The duo
lost just one match during the 1980
season, and represent one of Dief-
fenbach’s hopeful national
competitors.

The men, on the other hand, suf-
fered from graduation. Pitt lost
Doug White and Rip Wagner, the
No. I and No. 2 singles players, and
the team’s No. I doubles pair. How-
ever, Dieffenbach seems to have
filled the void. James McDonald, a
freshman from Monacca, should
occupy White's top slot, according
to Dieffenbach.

Also returning from last year’s 7-5
squad will be sophomores Jeff
Brand and Mark Weinberg.

And so, Fralic entered fall

Whatever happens. should
Fralic succeed, fail or never rise
above mediocrity, he will remain
a story, as much for what he does

accomplish as for what he

Said Dorothy Fralic, Bill’s

mother, “It’s hard to believe that
a sport can generate so much
interest.”

Fralic isn’t allowing himself to
believe all the praise or look too
far ahead.

‘‘I don’t have a role yet, I have
to perform,” Fralic said. “Just
like anyone else, I have to go out
and try and hope it’s what the
coaches want. If so, great. If not,
tough.”

“That’s football," said a
nearby reporter, who quickly
amended, “No, that’s life.” '

Fralic just nodded. ‘‘I’m no

different than anyone else.”
Sometimes, Fralic wishes.

Chipman Steps In, Pitt Steps Up to NCAA’s

continued from page twenty-seven

The season began with impressive
wins over St. Francis and St. Bona-
venture, spearheaded by the Pan-
thers’ tenacious l-3-l- zone.

But starting with the prestigious
Show Me Classic in Missouri over
Christmas, the Panthers entered a_
rollercoaster period in their season,
where they matched some impres-
sive wins with defense with some
puzzling, often close, losses where
they were plagued by a stone-cold
shooting touch. By mid-season, the
critics were railing at Chipman.

Chipman confidently said, “Wait
‘til the end of the season.”

In the next I2 games, the Panthers
lost as often as they won, going 6-6
and establishing a pattern for their
losses that was firmly entrenched.

A devastatingly quick team, the
Panthers tended to overpower their
opponents in the first 10 minutes of
each half. with the offense usually

born from the Panthers’ pilfering l-
3-1 zone defense._

Only Pitt’s horrendous shooting
from the field kept the games close at
the end, and the team suffered
through some late-minute scoring
droughts that cost them a few
victories.

Critics moaned. And Roy Chip-
man said wait ‘til the end of the sea-
son, practicing the one word he
preached all season: conﬁdence.

After an overtime loss to sixth-
ranked Maryland, Pitt went on a
tear, winning nine of its last 12,
including splits with cross—town

rival Duquesne and West Virginia. -

The skein marked the emergence of
Clancy, who, on Chipman’s orders,
took control of the team. .
Like any great player, Clancy
(who was later the Phoenix Suns
third-round draft pick) responded
and the Panthers finally had their
bread and butter on offense. And

just in time. '

The Panthers went into the East-
ern 8 tournament confident and a
live sleeper.

The first-round opponent was an
old nemesis, Rutgers, who traveled
to the Field House forthe game and
left it out of the tourney.

Next up was Eastern 8 regular sea-
son co-champ Rhode Island, at the
Civic Arena. It was never a contest.

The Panther defense was too
much for the Rams, even~without
Clancy, who fouled out early in the
second half. Pitt won going away,
74-45, thanks to a ton of steals, fast-
breaks and some brilliant play by
McMillian. Next came the Pitts-

burgh dream game in the final: Pitt

vs. Duquesne.
The game (some called it a war)
lived up to the billing but it was not

the expected matchup between mus- ’

cleman Bruce Atkins and Sam

Clancy that determined the game.

Rather, it was McMillian, a
skinny kid from Georgia, who
spread his arms and swiped every
loose ball that came his way. And
even some that didn’t.

It ended with a 64-60 Pitt victory
for the Eastern 8 championship and
automatic berth in the NCAA
regional in El Paso, Texas. McMil-
lian stole away the Eastern 8 Most
Valuable Player award along with
everything else

The NCAA tourney was almost
anti-climatic, even with Dwayne
Wallace’s triple-pump bank shot in
overtime, at the buzzer no less, that
pushed Pitt past the Idaho Vandals,
who entered the game 25-3. The
Panther dream ended against the
North Carolina Tarheels and their
trio of stars, James Worthy, Sam
Perkins and All-America AI Wood.

Chipman, who had advised ever-
yone to hold their tongues until the
season’s end, didn’t have to remind
anyone what he had said all along.

The wait was well worth it.

Mike Bond, despite missing all
but the final two dual meets last sea-

second at I50-pounds, losing a
tough match in the final to cham-
pion Tom'Fiorvanti, 6-4.

The unexpected No. 2 showing
sent Bond onto Nationals for the
second time in his Pitt career. Bond,
a senior, returns healthy this season,
according to Coryea, after recover-
ing from a broken rib, ankle prob-
lems and recurring leg problems
from knee surgery he underwent two
years ago. ._

Also returning’ are two fourth-

tournament, l90—pound Kurt Kara- 

novich and I67-pound Eric Harris.
Karanovich turned in the best dual
meet record on the team last season,
ll-6, as a sophomore, and Coryea
says Karanovich has the ability to
improve on his fourth-place finish
this season.

Although Coryea and head coach
Rande Stottlemyer still consider the
program in a rebuilding stage as they
enter their third season on the job,
Coryea said that, although the team
will still be young, it should benefit
from last season's experience.

“You can’t help but get better.
We’ll benefit from the experience,
and we’re looking to get a lot of
leadership from guys like Karano-
-vich and Jeff Wilps, who have been
here for awhile,” Coryea said.

Spikers No.3, Counting

corzlinued_/rum page !l\'(’I1I_l’-.S‘(’\’L’II

Joining Baird with All-East men-
tion was middleblocker Bill Knuth.
The 0-3 Knut.h won second team
honors, just missing a place on the
first team. Knuth, ajunior this year,
is known around the ECVL for his
strong net play, particularly his spik-
ing ability and hard hitting.

Pitt’s performance at Easterns
had Coach Ray Reilly beaming
throughout the tournament. And
rightly so. Reilly has led Pitt to a
solid position in the East in the short
three-year varsity existence of the
team.

With the lack of a scholarship
fund for recruiting players, Reilly
depends on a stiff conditioning pro-
gram, intensive technique instruc-
tion, the attraction ofarea athletes
to the Pitt campus, and a little bit of
luck as he embarks on molding a
team each season.

So far, it has worked. The Panth-
ers’ only obstacles at Easterns were
the familiar faces of foes Penn State
and Rutgers-Newark, who placed

first and second respectively at the
tournament. Penn State went on to
Nationals at Santa Barbara. Ca. to
finish No. 3 in the country. Before
their defeat at Easterns, Rutgers had
a stranglehold on the Eastern title
perennially fielding top 10 teams in
recent years.

Considering the caliber of the
competition and Pitt’s near-defeat
of Rutgers, both in the regular sea-
son and at the tournament, Reilly
was pleased with last season’s
showing.

“its the strongest third-place fin-
ish that anyone in the region could
have wanted,” Reilly said. “The
match against Rutgers showed that
we’re ready to play with the ‘big
boys’.” -

The enthusiasm seems to be carry-
ing over to the players as they look
ahead to the upcoming season.

“I was impressed with our play,”
said Knuth. “If we get a couple more
good players for next season, I think
we can be a strong contender for the
No‘. I spot in '82.” H

BILL KNUTH

Lady Gymnasts Up to East’s No.2

Continued from page thirty
Regina Carson, Gretchen Speich
and Babble Flock.

Seniors Carson, Martino and,
Evans return with two years of valu-
able experience and intent on
improving on last season, when all
three did well despite nagging
injuries.

Carson, a former All-America,
will continue competing in the all-
around, joined by Martino, who
Sanft expects big things from this
year.

Sanft also commended Speich,
Flock and Martin for their hard
work and improvement over the
summer, which showed when the
team came to Pitt for a four-day
training camp early this month.
Sanft said Speich and Flock have
picked up new many moves that
should improve their scoring, while
Martin “looked outstanding” at the
camp.

But while those three were active
in the gym this summer, Shirk has
been using the vacation time to rest
and heal from the various injuries
thatghit her last season, including a
bone spur in her ankle, some chronic
leg stress fractures, a shoulder injury
and a late-season virus that ham-

pered her performance at Easterns,
where she took fifth in‘ the all-
around. Shirk, a veteran of high-
level meets, turned down a bid to
compete at the World University
Games in Romania earlier this
summer so that she could rest.
How good is a healthy Lisa Shirk?
“On a good day, she's a contender
for the national title,” Sanft said.
Looking ahead to this year, Sanft
thinks the Pantherettes can improve
on last years No. I2 rank. With the
team’s switch from the AIAW to the
NCAA, they’ll have to, to make it to
Nationals again. Under the NCAA
format, only the teams with the top
10 scoring averages in the country
advance to Nationals, instead of the

AlAW’s field of 16. But Sanft isn’t

despairing.

“We‘ve never had so many girls so
improved over the summer,” Sanft
said. “We have the potential ofbeing
better than l0th place, and I'd say we
could maybe even move into the top
six (nationally).” * ‘

The way the team has been leap-
frogging up the rankings the last few
years, can the top be far away?

all-around performer last season for

Kennedy’s top recruit this season
is Renee Henderson, a sprinter from
Peabody High School. Henderson

was a four-time city champ in the"

I00-meter dash, and this year fin-
ished third in the event at the PIAA
State Championships, as well as gar-
nering a second in the 200-meter
dash. -

“Renee should help us out this
year," said Kennedy. ‘‘In three years,
I’d like to see Pitt be a national con-
tender. lt’s not ‘impossible.

“The biggest adjustments I've had
to make were to the people at Pitt

and to the money situation. I had

more money to work with on my
club. So, this_year is going to be a

challenge, but already, Pitt is help- _

ing us out."

Kennedy was referring to a
summer project at the stadium
which resurfaced the outdoor track.

This issue was almost impossible to get-out,
but we did it with the help of the following
people: Gina and Sam K. forthetyping; Susie
5. for things too numerous to mention; Mary
K. for support and open-mindedness; Pam
Reyner for the great drawing; GIG (that's in
French, lcidsl); Billy for the wonderful photos;
Sam "I'll even do heavy metal" Matthews;
I. P. for those groovy (1) records; Rick ‘and ]eff
for having absolutely nothing to do with this
magazine; Marcy Petrusch for her unwaver-
ing loyalty; all the other people we forgot to
thank; and to ourselves t'oo (why/not?}.

By JANE HOLAHAN

"You know, everything is here in
London, all the bands and everything.
It's just dead in America, that's why
we came here.” I-'ve come to the Mar-
quee, a well established London club
to.see the Snax, formerly of Eddie and
the Hot Rods. I looked around. the
Marquee’s bathroom to find a pair of
girls crouched on the floor. The girls
sort of looked 'alike—spikey red hair,
thick eye liner, fishnet stockings and —
miniskirts. But I had been in London
for a couple days, so I was used to it;
in fact they looked pretty tame.

See, the first thing you have to

_l_<now about London is that the bars

close at 11:00. Being Americans, of
course, we don't go outguntil late-
real Iate‘——which explains why,’ once
we found our wayto Picadilly Circus
our first night in London, we wound
up atsthe ultimate tourist trap, the
_world—famous Whiskey A~.Go—C-o. It
stays open until 2:00 AM. ‘

That's the only thing this place has
going for it. We ran intoa bunch of
guyslwho were having a stag party,
which was a lot» of fun, let me tell you.
One of the "guests" was a genuine
skinhead. When we asked him what
his philosophy was, he put a big grin
on his face and said, "Violence! The
skin'eads rule London." Charming‘.

Defiance is a big thing in England,
alth'ou'gh people ..show it in various '
‘w’a-ys.'Some people dye their hair
platinum blond and wear blood red

must wear, and everyone takes it
extremely seriously. It's a wayof life.

just that they're so used to it. Music

Eye of the Needle has some good
things going for it, the best of which
is an exploration of the complexities
of distorted, desperate love. Unfortu-
nately this, like most of the other
good things in this film, tend to be
snipped off before they have a chance
to blossom.

These weaknesses seem mostly
attributable to Stanley Mann's
screenplay. It is difficult to pinpoint»
his focus. Although it seems rather
clear at the onset of the film, the
story we expect to see never takes
shape until the end of the picture.

The Needle (Donald Sutherland), is

a Nazi spy planted in England during -

WW II. We are introduced to him and
his ruthless nature sharply, sud-
denly. Sutherland's splendid charac-
ter composition has beautiful tones
of understatement; cold-blooded and
flat-toned, the Needle is propelled by
his lack of emtion. And so, the Needle
is established quickly. .

At the same time, we meet Lucy
(Kate Nelligan), on her wedding day.
Married to a young, handsome Spit-
fire pilot of the RAF, their honey-
moon never begins, as the young
husband runs their car off a bridge
after leaving the reception. The
development of Lucy is manipulated
by Director Marquand,-who gives us
a first example of his stark, thought-
ful story-telling ability. Nelligan's
part is however not really much of a"
part at all until the later moments of
the picture. That is the first problem
in the film.

The picture jumps ahead four
years, to the advent of the Allied
assault on the beaches of Normandy.
The Needle is still in England, only
now the British know of him, and are
hot on his trail. Why must they get
him so quickly? The Needle knows
when and where the Allies will strike,
and once he gets the information to
Hitler, the war could very easily be
lost. Lucy ‘now lives in an isolated
place, called Storm Island, with her

Blow Out, director Brian De Palma’s
latest film, has plenty of good things
going for it. Stylistically, the film is at
the height of its intendedjgenre: a
political thriller, bringing_into ques—
tion a whole political and economic
institution, America, as depicted
through exaggeration of nihilist
behavior via swift implication and
equally clever passing sight gag sym-
bolism. Borrowing from several
Hitchcockia_n methods and tech-
niques, De Palma creates a set of

eclectic - twists in imagery crystalliz- ‘

ing into some wonderful and some
mixed results. The most basic draw-
back audiences will sense by the film's
closing dark humor is that the story
and nearly every character is sacri-
ficed at the cost (and some will say for
the‘ good) of the effects.

The story, or the semblance there-
of, goes something like this: Jack
Terri (John Travolta), a sound effects
man for a soft-core porn outfit in Phi-
ladelphia, happens upon the sound of
a car skidding off a bridge, the result
of, a tire blow-out’, which, subse-

But it seems to take too long. With

a storm and wrecks on the rocks of
Storm Island, where he is taken in by
Lucy and her reluctant husband.

intensifies her loneliness. Therefore,
when she falls in love with the Nee-
dle, it is not so much a grotesque mis-
match as it is a desperate, purging
affair. Four years of pent-up passion
and a need for attention comes to.a
thunderous apex. But the Needle? It
is hard to say, for up to this point, we
have watched him tromp through
seven emotionless murders for the
Nazi cause. Love is no match for his
appointed mission, but... .

almost ninety minutes to get to the
eventual coupling of these two char-

tain U.S. ‘Senator from Massachu-
setts who lost a certain young
woman's life at Chappaquiddick.

Undeniably, John Travolta’s role as
the mature, truth-bent Jack is special.

I He is refreshing, unbound from the

constraints that tight macho cliches

have never permitted him in some of '

his previous feature films,’ Urban Cow-
boy and Saturday Night Fever, to name a
few. Travolta has never been better.
His drive throughout is high-strung,
incredibly vivid in his obsessive ‘and
inexhaustible passionforlfinding and
exposing the truth.

Director of‘ photography,‘ Vilrnos
Zsigmond, is superior ‘in several
sequences, as he shows with a classic

non-stop sequence of swish pan pho- '

tography, a desperate lack in his stu-
dio searching at a maddening pace for
the recorded proof of the ”accident,”

unaware, at first, that every single

tape-has been erased. New tension-
filled sounds fill the studio with each
completed cycle of the camera. In

day before Lucy finds out who this
man really is. (The Needle has killed
her husband and the lighthouse
keeper, the only other two people on
the island besides Lucy and her son.)
She manages to get an S.O.S. out, but
before the Brits can get there, Lucy
has to stop the Needle from radioing
his information to the Fatherland. Is
there difficulty here? Sure, murder is
not an easy thing, and murdering
someone you love, no. less. But this is
the problem: is Lucy murdering

one day, to be sure. Her affection for

him, at least, hasn't had the time to.

which side’ will win the war (and we
know which side won the war), but
that is not the point of this picture. At

least, that is not the pointwe were led-
to believe. There is too much padding ‘ ,

here, too much cloak-and-dagger
foreplay to evoke the type of emotion
Marquand and Mann try’ to hand us
in the last half hour. The‘same pas.-

sion with which Lucy loves this man '

is supposed to be converted, takin'g
that same energy and using it for
opposite ends. The path, however,
that leads us from point A to point4B

. is hardly straight, so by the time we ' I

do get to where this picture is taking
us, it's not believable.

This is all too bad, for the acting is
fine; Sutherland ‘is an underrated
actor, probably due to underwritten
scripts like this one. Director Mar-

Tales Of Sex
Symbols And i
Tan Playboys

 By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

Let's face it, sex symbols aren’t
known for making great movies. Rita
Hayworth, Brigitte Bardot, and
Marilyn Monroe are remembered not
for their astute acting, but, rather, for
their cheekbones, legs, and, ample‘
bosoms. So it comes as no surprise
that Tarzan, The ApeMan, starring Bo

Derek, is not a good movie. . ‘ ’

- Tarzan is Jane's story. Indeed, Tar-

zan doesn't even appear’ until halfway _

through the picture. The story begins
with Jane's journey to find her father,
a world-famous explorer who lefther
wife’ and infant daughter several
years "before. Jane's mother has just
. died, leaving her an enormous inher-

V itance which enables her to travel to 

the remotest interior of Africa where
i‘ he finally catchesup with long‘-lost

dad; She's come for two reasons: curi- _
‘osity and revenge. While she's cur-

ious to find out what kind of person

her father really is, she's also filled

with hate for him and intends to

make him miserable for deserting his
‘ family. But the hate doesn't last very
_long, and soon Jane's off with her
father and his crew to find a fabled
elephant’s graveyard. Along the way,
Jane gets into various predicamenfs
and is saved by——guess who—Tarzan
(Miles O’Keefe), a tall, white jungle
man who scares the pants off of all
the natives for some unknown
reason.

The most interesting thing about
Tarzan, The Ape Man, is the physical
appearances of the two leading char-
acters. Bo Derek's face and figure are
already well-known, but while she
may have suffered overexposure in
tabloids, she certainly hasn't done the
same in movies, 10 being her only
major credit. As she prances about in
see-through blouses or nothing at all,

V it's easy to see why she's the reigning

queen of sex symbols. Miles O’Keefe,
though, may give her a run for the
money in that department, as the
male sex symbol for the eighties.
While he doesn't have a single line of
dialogue, he certainly makes his pres-
ence known by swinging from trees,
swimming, and, in general, flexing
his muscles.

Derek and O’Keefe aren't required

, to act, so this task was left up to
_Richard Harris as Jane's slightly

crazed father. His hyper-charged
performance is similar to that of
Peter O’Toole's in last year's Stunt
Man: an ego-maniac whoeveryone
wants to hate, but can't-because of his-
charisma. , I I '
Tarzan‘, The Ape Man is certainly not
the worst movie of the--year;_in fact,
its hollowness might even be. consi-
dered somewhat fasciriating. But
then again, it.mi‘ght beconsidered

Hamilton used to be an acting pheno-
menon; he was one of those people
whose occupation was A listed as
”actor,” but who was more well--
known for being a Hollywood type

who went to a lot of parties and.
always had a tan. He still has the tan, _

like Love At First /Bite and the newly— '

released Zorro, ”'The/ Gay Blade. No,
these movies ’aren’t great works of
art, but they do have a large audience
and serve their purpose of entertain-

THE MOTOR SHOW

Written by Eugene Ionesco
THE FUNAMBULISTS
Written by lean Genet.

Both Directed by Suzanne Rini
Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre

By THOM PALMER

It is difficult to talk of The Motor
Show, the first of the two one-act
plays at Pittsburgh Lab Theatre.
Eugene Ionesco’s play, originally
written for French radio, rattles out
of the darkness and, just as quickly,
returns to that from which it came; a
stage time of something close to ten
minutes. But one gets the sense that
ten minutes is precisely the amount
of time Ionesco needed to cast plenty
of light onto a landscape throroughly
rich with animals of society. Any
more would seem ponderous or pre-
tentious. Whereas a Beckett, in the
fashion of Waiting for Godot says, "This
is all there is,” again and again and
again, Ionesco says, ”This is all there
is, so why bother going into it_any

further." This comparison is not

meant to categorize these two great
_writers, nor is it meant to show a
preference of one over another. The
difference is a matter of style, and
brevity better lends itself to Inones-
co’s style.

What this light does, beside illumi-
nate a compact world of personal,
political and commercial habits, is
throw a forest of shadows that we are
left to muse.over. It is not the action
of the play, for there is not much time
for action, but the words, as well as
the sounds of the words which.pro-
vide the effects.‘

"We turn away nobody,” said Fiege.

”You can walk into the office, scene

shop, or costume shop and say_ that

’ you want to do something, and they

will find something for you to do,” a

little chuckle of understatement

there, then seriously, "it's practical

wrote some racy things during antiq- «

ing to make a sale. But what sale?
What is she selling and, for that mat-
ter, what really i is he buying.
Nothing; that is probably the best
answer for both questions. She is just
selling and he is just buying, and it
doesn't matter what. To ask oneself

‘what they are talking about, and

what both are trying to acheive from
a physical standpoint is meaningless.
It is just their words, sounds, actions
and gestures that are the core of this
play, that turns _word-play into
thought-play: reaction calmly follow-
ing action, affirmation calmly follow-
ing interrogation. What it
demonstrates is a ridiculously accu-

rate form of social.sparring; we don't .

have to know what they are doing in
order to know how they are going to
do it. Ionesco has a view of the world
that is painfully more precise than
perhaps we would care to admit
sometimes. The Motor Show is excellent
fun.

But the night gets even better. The
Funambulists, in addition to providing

—a great venue for the talents of
McCaque, Rini and Karen Sund- p
strom Backman, is a haunting, swirl- . '

ing, engrossing, rhythmical piece, the

only shameful part being that it has '
to end. The Funambulists is the exhorta-_

tions of the artist sifting through his

soul and trying to find the seed of his’

artistry. The artist in this case is Uno

(McCaque), a‘ tightrope walker.’ It”
deals with the source of art; art that r
gives life not only to Uno, the artist,-

but to.those who watch him. His art
runs through his veins; his wire, the
ever-important apparatus, pumps it,
teaches him how to live and breathe,
to crave the night, the only thing for
which he lives: the performance.
His sister (Backman) and his
mother (Rini) instruct him, and read

him dissertations on the nature on '

the maintenance of the artist's soul.

{Though Uno has his -_ own ideas,

study of_ theater's rich tradition; the
pillars andsfoundation of the stage,

one might say.

If one's preference is more toward‘
experimental, alternative drama, _
then the student-run Studio Theatre ‘
provides an outlet. A bit more diver- ‘

sified, geared toward the undergrad-
uate non-m_ajor, Studio gives one the

» chance to exploreany orsall facets. of

"You can walk into the office, scene shop, or
costume shop and say thntsyou want todo some-
thing, and they will find something for you to
do...we turn nobody away.” ‘ E 

Of course, one has a choice of

which type of theater they would find '

most suitable.

Pirates:
This Year's
Fashionplate  

PIRATES
Rickie Lee Jones
Warner Brothers

When Rickie Lee Jones burst
on the scene in 1979, her rise
was so meteoric that she
showed every characteristic of
your typical one-shot wonder.
The big question was, did she
have genuine talent or was she
just lucky? Pirates, her second
album, supplies the answer-
this woman has talent, an
immense amount of ‘talent.

Pirates is a stunning achieve-
ment because Jones pushes the
emotions and the challenges she
proposes to the limit and she
never lets down. Hers is a des-
' perately romantic story and she
tells it through the same lost
souls and tr,ansients who inhab-
ited" her first album, though
the stakes seem much higher
this time. This is due to Jones’
ability to create people and life-
times in a fewgshort phrases,
and then to be able to back the
lyrics up with strong and often
powerful music.

Take, for example, Eddie, a
character in Jones’ song ”Living

know about him is contained in
three short lines: ”EdaIie's got one

- Arsums   it

toon/when a pretty girl comes by)"
Jones’ brief and economical des-
criptions constantly pay off.

-The songs are less hyper and

‘19lii=iWirts'bvt?a*‘* ReY*‘°'

   

more hypnotic this‘ time. ”We
Belong Together” is an anthem,
while at the same time it has a
fragile feel to it. When Jones
sings, "I think it's better to face it/We
belong together," there is no way
you can disagree, but you also
wonder if she'll ever get her
wish. ‘

‘The mood of Pirates is basically
melancholy—love affairs that
should be working out, but.
aren't, dreams that never get off
the ground. and lives that are
being wasted. T718 most
dramatic shift in mood comes
between the haunting ”Skele-
ons" and the lively, almost flip
”Woody and Dutch on the Slow
Train to Peking.”'This sudden’
change in mood is a risk that
works. In less‘ assured hands it
could well. belcallous. ‘ .

Jones’ unique slurry singing
style sometimes manages to
lessen the impact of her lyrics
(occasionally they're incompre_-
hensible) but _more often than

not it only makes the songs‘

more seductive, and her phras-
ing is usually right on the mark.

Occasionally, albums like
Pirates come along (like Joni Mit-
chell’s Court and Spark) that
sound so self-assuredand are
presentedin such original and
fresh ways that you wonder

how they could not have existed, ‘

before. These are the albums
that endure. It is -safe to say that
Pirates will endure. J
