Penalize Pi
Lambda Phi

Rushing Rules Broken;
$25 Fine Levied

Pi Lambda Phi, men’s national
social fraternity, was fined $25 by
the Fraternity Committee for vio-
lating the rule restricting fraterni-
ties to holding only two rushing
events during the last rushing sea-
son. This action was taken after a
thorough investigation and report
of a subcommittee.

A gathering held Thursday, Nov-
ember 12, of about 32 persons asso-
ciated with Pi Lambda ldhi and
four or five rushees constituted a
rushing event is the decision of the
Fraternity Committee. As the Pi
Lambda Phis held their two regu-
lation events during the rushing
period, this third event made it a
violation of the rule restricting the
number to two.

The explanation advanced by the
Pi Lambs was that some of their
members had engagements with
rushees and that on the spur of the
moment they decided to go along
with other members who were
leaving for Villa Royale. Even
though the holding of the event
may have been accidental. the com-
mittee decided that it was a rush-
ing function and a violation of the
rule.

On this basis the committee felt
it was a violation against the spirit
of the rule and penalized the tra-
ternity. A member of the fraternity
is to report to the Dean of Men's
office each week-end, Additional
punishment is notifying all the
other fraternities and publicizing
the event.

Rutgers Head Aims To
Increase Research

 

New Brunswick, N. J ., March 9.-—
(New York Times Service.)—Dr.
Robert C. Clothier, forme dean of
men at the University 0 Pitts-
burgh, began his duties this week
as fourteenth president of Rutgers
University, succeeding Dr. John M.
Thomas, who resigned in October,
1930.

Believing that “the emphasis in
athletics should be placed where
the greatest number can benefit."
Dr. Clothier said he would favor
less attention to intercollegiate
sports and rather more intramural
athletics.

tnont us, in education work." he

day, “can be grasped best by un-
hurried study and by a spirit of
friendly cooperation on the part of
those who have to do with them.
My hope is to enter upon my new
duties quietly, to come to know
the members of the faculty and the
student body, to learn their view-.
points and discover their inter-
ests.”

“Similarly, I hope to meet and

,-talk with the alumni and with the

State officials who, like ourselves,
are desirous of providing the best
possible educational opportunity
for the young people of New Jer-
sey. It is generally recognized
that our universities exist primar-
ily to increase the common store
of knowledge and to provide the in-
dlvidual student with the best pos-
sible opportunity for self-develop

of strengthening the research pro-
gram of a university cannot be too
greatly stressed.

“Nor, on the other hand, can the
importance of good teaching be too
deeply emphasized. Good teaching
is more than a mastery of the
|teacher’s ﬁeld; it combines with
lthat mastery a capacity to inter-
pret the course content interesting-
ly, a sincere liking for young peer-
,ple and the power to inspire them.
‘Men and women who devote their
lives to research and to teaching
have, in the minds of many of.us,
-the two greatest jobs in the world."

Arrangements for, Dr. Clothier’s

Health Acts
Are Delayed

Illness of Chairman Iss
Cause of Hold-up

 

Immediate action in connection
with the improvement of student
health conditions at the University
was temporarily delayed this week
by the illness of _Reed Rose, Dent.
'32, chairman of the committee
which was to have submitted defi-
nite relief measures to John Weber,
University business manager, f-or
administrative approval.

Rose, whose recommendations
for a more adequate health service
stirred Student Council into action
at last Week’s meeting, hoped to
be back on the campus before next
Tuesday, so that the reaction of ad-
ministration officials could be laid
before the student legislators for
discussion:

It was expected late this week’

that a meeting between Weber and
the committee which was authoriz-
ed by Council to draw up two plans
for health relief, might be affect-
ed before Tuesday’s meeting.

The proposed measures would
provide one plan for immediate ac-
tion with regard to establishing ad-

equate health service, and a second
plan for the development of a per-
manent health service policy. Chair
man Rose and his committee have
been investigating health service
facilities and their maintenance
through student payment at other
large urban universities, with a
view to determining the minimum
fee which might be assessed stu-
dents for the successful operation
of an adequate health service.

{sion of 1932, the School of Educa-

tion will revise its program, accord-
ing to Theodore W. Si dle, assistant

“‘ The Machines We Are”
ls Revised by Dr. Hance

Dr. Robert T. lHance, head of the
department of Zoology recently an-
nounced the publication of a revis-
ed and enlarged edition of his book
“The Machines We Are,” a work
destined primarily as a non-techni-
cal source of information in biology.
The first edition, only half as large
as the recent one, which appeared
two years ago, has been augmented
so that it is almost an entirely new
book.

"The goal of biology,” we learn,
“is a. knowledge of living mechan-
ics, the result of which is greater
physical comfort. This in turn leads
to that rare human attribute known
as common sense, which in itself is
spiritual happiness." Although not
a textbook the Work is excellent
reference reading as well as an
every-man-his-own-doctor sort of
book.

Could Announces 12]

Dr. George Gould, assistant pro-
fessor of secondary education, an-

school or South High school.

In making the statement, Dr.
Gould gave the following numbers
for the different subjects: 24,
English, 25, History, 12, Social
Sciences, 9 French, 2, German, 5,
Latin.3 Spanish, 3, Commercial
subjects, 8, Mathematics, 17, Sci-
ence, and 11 Physical Education.

Dr. ‘Manuel Conrad Elmer will ad-
dress the College Club at an open
meeting Wednesday evening, March
16, on the subject, "Family Adjust-
ment and Social Change." This 1ec-

5 Style Show

(Continued From Page One.)

A special stage has been de-
signed for the fashion parade,
which includes a runway extending
toward the audience, spotlights,‘
and a background of psalms and
ferns.

Mfss Grace Ely, who will direct
the women's fashion this after-
noon, is a recognized authority on
fashion. Her knowledge of lines,
colors, and fabrics has been sup-
plemented byfrequent trips abroad.
In a recent talk on “Spring Fash-
ions” she made the following com-
ments, illustrative of her thorough
knowledge. ’

“The most evident changes in
the styles are above the waist.‘
Emphasis is ‘being laid on high-
waistlines, high necks, and broad
shoulders. The styles are appar-
ently simple, but technically com-
plicated. The military inﬂuence is
quite dominant. As far as colors
are concerned, the red, white, and
blue combination is very new, and
beige, not only alone, but in strik-
ing combinations, is being shown
considerable. Water color tints
are now for evening wear.

The various materials in crinkled
and knit- effects will play a promi-
nent part in the spring wardrobe.
Much attention is being given to
woven texture and design. Short
bell-hop jackets are the latest in
suits and two-piece dresses. Coats
are ﬁtted and are worn either with
or without belts. The new gar-
ments are mostly tailored with a
soft touch added by collars and
scarfs which are detachable.”

The chairman in charge of the
Style Show which is being spon-
sored by the Pitt Weekly and the
Pitt Panther is Wayne Weaver,
Bus. Ad. '33.

 

 

Bicentennial Claimed
Cause For Style Change

 

The Bi-Centennial influence has
extended even into the designs and
colors of women's clothes, accord-
ing to Miss Grace Ely, art consult-
ant of the Bureau of Retail Train-
ing, in an address before the W0-
men's Association of the Universi-
ty. There is a hint of the patriotic
in the new dark blue silk dresses
printed‘ with tiny white -stars.

Miss Ely feels that although the
new dresses will follow definite
trends, the smartly gowned woman
will express her own personality in
her clothes. Beige and black offer
a favorite color combination, and
for the demure young lady there
are the clear pastel shades, and
the ever accepted black and White
combination. Variety in necklines,
and the new showing of bows, tucks
and small puffed sleeves. will as-
sist the women in choosing their
spring wardrobe.

“Advertising Agency” Is
Speaker’s Theme

“The Advertising Agency,” was
the topic selected by George W.
Rowland. director of market re-
search for the Pittsburgh Sun-Tele-
graph, at the Wednesday morning
meeting-of the University Retail
Research Bureau.

Speaking of trends of modern-ad
vertising agencies the speaker
said, “Agencies have become more
than fine copy producing plants for
advertisers. They have become
methodical searchers of truths
about how much people buy, what
they buy, and what price is paid.”

Mr. Rowland cited two cases of
this kind of research, naming
'Macy's of New York, which two
years ago conducted a wide can-
vass of its customers, and the R.
L. Polk C0,, which makes such sur-
veys in the leading cities of the
country. ‘

“In this manner the most effect-
ive advertising can be produced.
The advertiser knows what he
wants; the agency produces the
wanted effect with the minimum of
expense and time."

Harris Talks
On Happiness

Names Steps Needed For
Joy In Unhappy World

 

 

In one of the most concise ad-
dresses ever given before a univer-
sity assembly here, Dr. Erdman
Harris, professor at Union Theo-

logical Seminary. outlined his
formula fbr the attainment of a
personal happiness in an unhappy
world. This attainment, stated Dr.
Harris, is necessary in the inter-
ests of sanity and effectiveness.

The steps which Dr. Harris out-
lined are: stop worrying about the
things we cannot help; work sys-
tematically and creatively with the
things which we can solve; and be-
lieve that there’s a purpose in the
work that we are doing. Dr. Harris
stated that a false conception of
happiness is one of a complete ad-
justment to the world.
Dr. S. P. Franklin, head of the de-
partment of religious education, in-
troduced the speaker. Llda Jones,
Col. ’32, acted as chairman at the
assembly. The university orches-
tra, with M. -S. Rocereto directing,
played at the assembly.

spective department heads, which
in turn, must be exchanged for
dance tickets through the same per-
son.

Robert Schindel, Eng. ’32, is
chairman of the dance and is be-
ing assisted by John Stirling, Eng.
’32. The following are department
representatives from whom tickets

Believing that the present cap-
italistic system is undergoing a
gradual change, and that its ulti-
mate end will be socialism, Paul H.

Blanchard, executive secretary of
the league of Industrial Democra-
cy. presented the case for a social
istic system at the Inquiry Club
meeting Wednesday, March 9.

Blanchard ridiculed the capital-
istic idea that we do not need a
new economic plan and that the
law of supply and demand will auto-
matically make all adjustments.
e chief evils of the capitalistic
system he outlined as follows: a
chaotic lack of economic planning,
the very poor distribution of wealth
the queer ways in which machines

and work are handled and the de-
feating of man’s nature by the sys-
tem of class control.

Characterizing present plans for
economic rehabilitation as being of
two -sorts, the Swope plan, and Sov-
iet Russia, Blanchard declared that
the Swope plan which proposes to
place large scale industry in trust
would ‘build up a system strong
enough to dominate the govern-
ment. Blanchard praised the Soviet
Union as the first great attempt to
plan an economic order in detail.

The speaker then advocated the
building up of a. great industrial-
political organization which would
represent all social and economic
groups with complete nationaliza-
tion of industry.

Requirement
Change .-Passes

The Fraternity Committee of the
University indorsed both of the
recommendations made last week
by the Interfraternity Council-

Initiation of first semester fresh-
men he reduced from 12 credits
and 12 quality points to 12 credits
and only 8 quality points; and that
there will be no restriction placed
on the number of events that a
—fraternity may have during the
coming rushing season.

, In reducing the number of qual-
ity points necessary for initiation
and allowing the fraternities to
hold as many rushing events as
they desire, the Fraternity Com
mittee makes it possibl for more
boys to join more social fraterni-
ties at the present time. Both of
these rules are subject to change
and will only remain in affect as
long as they work out favorably.

The number of qllality points
was reduced largely on the evi-
dence submitted by a subcommit-
tee of the Interfraternity Council,
which investigated the condition
and found that freshmen who made
8 quality points during their first
semester at the University gradllat—
ed in the regulation four years.
This change will allow men pledg-
ed last November and making 8
quality points to be initiated some
time during the present term.

The inability to define a “rush-
ing event,” and the n_umerous mis-
interpretations lately has influ-
enced the Fraternity Committee to
place no restriction on the number
of events that may be held during
the coming period. Rushing will
open at 9 o'clock next Wednesday
morning, March 16, and end at 2
o’clock the morning of March 20.
This change will not affect the old
University rule that mixed parties
at fraternities can only be held over
the week ends.

. Convention, Here

 

Senator Albell W. Barkley. of Ken-
tucky, will address the delegates
to the University of Pittsburgh po-
litical convention on April 8 as the
representative of the Democratic
party. Senator Barkley is one of
four national political leaders who
will discuss the issues of the next
campaign before the student dele-
gates.

The senior senator from Ken-
tucky was first elected to Congress
as representative from his district
to the 63rd session of Congress;
there he was a member of the For-

’eign and Interstate Commerce com-

mittees of-the House. Since his-
election of the Senate in 1926,

Senator Barkley has been particu-
larly interested in
fecting transportation policies.

At present, he is a member of
the -Senate committees on Finance,
Banking and Currency, Interstate
Commerce and Library. Too, Sen-
at Barkley has been active in
behalf of flood control legislation,
farm relief, tariff legislation, and
veterans’ relief measures.

Senator Barkley is thoroughly ac.
quainted with the machinery of po-
litical conventions, having been a
delegate to the last three Demo-
cratic conventions and having been
chairman of the Kentucky state
Democratic convention.

legislation af- _

During the past week, twenty ad- ‘A

ditional petitions were turned over
to the executive committee, swell-
ing the number of delegates who
will attend the convention to sev-
enty, representing more than sev-
en hundred students who have
signed petitions. Those who wish to’
submit petitions will have the op-
portunity to do so during the next
three weeks, although students are
urged to hand in their petitions as
soon as possible so as to be more,
certain of getting their committee
preference.

The schedule of events for the
political convention calls for a ban-
quet Friday evening, April 8, at
which the nationally prominent po-
litical leaders will outline the
stands of the political parties they

represent as regards to present
day national issues.
The following day, Saturday,

April 9, will be given over to com-
mittee sessions, during which the
delegates will discuss the particu-
lar problem of their committee.
Prominent authorities from the
business, and political world will
appear before the committees to
testify and act as technical advis-
ers. Each committee will have a
technical adviser from the faculty
who will, however, take no part in
framing the platform. _

Sunday .t'he entire convention
will meet as a committee of the
whole and discuss the reports of
the several special committees.

The platform in its final form will »

then be forwarded to the four
leading political parties as repre-
sentative of student opinion at Pitt.
A straw vote will be taken to select
favorable candidates for Presl- ,
dent. -
There will be a meeting of the
executive and advisory committees
of the convention in room 308 Alum-
ni -Hall at 12:30 t‘oday.

By IRV ROBBINS
. At present Pitt’s spring sports program consists of track, tennis,
golf and spring football practice. The program does not seem ade-
gquate for a school as large as Pitt with its many diversiﬁed athletic
At first thought lacrosse, baseball and rowing suggest them-

Iﬁacrosse is the fastest spreading collegiate game in this country.

yioriginally an Indian game, it has been extensively played bythe Cana-
dians and has lately been transplanted into this country with great

success. Lacrosse is admirably suited to the athletic temperament of
the American youth. It possesses much of the bodily contact and
spectacular play of football, and it has that element of danger which
the fans seem to crave,

of the players. -

The game is an easy one to learn despite its seeming com-
9 plicatlon. Clever stick handling in lacrosse is as effective and
important as it is in hockey. Each team consists of twelve
men, and equipment is comparatively cheap. The num ‘ of
accidents in the game has been exaggerated beyond all sem-
blance of truth.
Wherever the game has been adopted, the students have
shown a great deal of enthusiasm for it. if it were adopted
at Pitt, it is likely that the students would react in the same
manner as at other places where it is played. Perhaps it would
be difficult to put out ‘a team good enouh at first to compete
.with eastern and southern schools, but the fact that little ex-
perienced material is on hand would add zest to the ﬂht for
positions and tend to heighten interest in the game. Schools
in Maryland and New York state havegthe best teams, provid-
ing competition for Pitt near home. The game has in several
. schools been worked out intramurally before being made an
' intercollegiate sport. The Pitt stadium would be an ideal
playing field.

Baseball has had a trial and failed. On all sides it is admitted
that the present day youth is quitting the once “national game.” The

, principal trouble with college baseball was that it didn't pay. Pitt’s

college baseball couldn’t compete with the Pirates’ major league base-
ball, so the college sport did a fadeout. The trouble with the old
system was its attempt to compete against the majors, to play base-

ball intercollegiately with trips and other he-avy expenses.

‘Under similar conditions, and they would be similar, it is doubtful

' if baseball could be reinstated at Pitt. A variation of the game, mush-

_b‘all,’is a success intramurally; and, at present, it appears that the
school will have to be content with it.

y , The third of the three sports, rowing, has received the most im-
petus from local sports writers, and it is to our mind the least prac-
tical. Of all the sports which are at all widely followed by American
colleges, rowing is the most expensive. A shell is in itself quite a
considerable investment. In addition there are boat houses and other
types of water equipment, all of which would have to be purchased
L The schools which foster rowing are all
situated on suitable bodies of water, and though it is pointed out that
the Monongahela River would be an excellent place for racing, it would
be necessary to transport, the crews to and from the river every day

_ for practice. -

It would be necessary for Pitt to hire a highly specialized
rowin coach. All of the money for rowing would have to be
shelled out with little or no revenue coming in. Observation
cars and great crowds of people on banks and bridges are very

* nice looking in the movietone but bring surprisingly little into
the coffers. A great many of the schools supporting crews are
big time” with heavy endowments or benevolent alumni, two
things which Pitt has little of. When the financial statements
-of Harvard and Yale athletics are printed at the end of each
ﬁscal year, the only sport showing a proﬁt is football, and the

sport showing by far the largest deficit is rowing. .

The other day while discussing charges of professionalism leveled
at college football, it was brought out that the situation of paying

"ofcollege athletes was in some measure comparable to the situation

in amateur tennis. It was declared that the ‘great. tennis plants, such
as Forest Hills, were particularly anxious to maintain a strict ama-

' tour standing, inasmuch as while the players are amateurs, it is only

necessary to pay their expenses. On the other hand, it was pointed out
that if the players were to turnprofessional, they would demand guar-
antees and percentages of the gate in return for their play. This is
also the case in amateur as opposed to professional‘ boxing. If the
amateurs were as capable as the professionals’ and could draw crowds
in -some way measurable, the promoters would retain a greater share
of the “velvet.” As it is, the amateurs get a trophy that costs ten
bucks and the professional draws down a five hundred dollar guar-
antee before almost the same size house. .

To bring college football into the discussion, the fans are right
now in the highest pitch of their enthusiasm over the game. College

football with its attendant rah! rah! consistently draws the largest

~-crowds of any sports spectacle in the country. And it is an amateur
sport. The revenue from football is in many cases the funds used to
-start a building program. A winning football team serves as splefldid
free advertising. So it can be seen that college authorities are especi-
ally anxious to maintain strict or semi-strict amateurism. It means

In Collegiate
Swim Meet

 

Hanna, 9 Carik, Schmieler
Seek Titles In
Specialties

 

This Saturday at Lancaster, Pa.,
the Eastern Intercollegiate Asso-
ciation Swimming meet, for indi-
vidual honors, will be held at the
Franklin and Marshall pool. Hav-
ing swept through its scheduled
season undefeated, the University
of Pittsburgh men are ceded a
more than even chance to run off
with the majority of the places.

Jack Hanna, who broke the 440
yard dash record for the Trees’
pool last Saturday against Frank-
lin and Marshall, should win this
event handily. Pitt has competed
against the four best teams in the
league and Hanna has yet to be
defeated in this event, Also, due
to his brilliant victory over Klunk
of New York University, Hanna is

" considered a serious threat in the
- 100 yard dash.

Carik Dives
Carik, who has not lost th
fancy diving event a. single time
this year, is expected to receive
plenty of competition from Crall
of case, although he defeated him
in the Case meet last Friday.
Although he got off to a bad
start, Herman Adlersberg, will
prove a real threat for anyone who
intends to take the 40 yard dash.
Last Saturday the local star hung
up a new Trees’ record, while
competing against Franklin and
Marshall. He covered the distance
in the fast time of 18.3 seconds.
In the 200 yard breaststroke,
there is no reason why Joseph
Schmieler should not take a place
He has been a. consistent winner
for the Golden Panther through-
out the entire season, beating the
best men that Case, Rider
Franklin and Marshall, and Woos-
ter could offer. The relay team,
although it proved a weak cog in
the swimming aggregation early
in the season, has done brilliantly
in the past few dual meets, and
should at least place on Saturday.
Power in Specialties
A resume of the strength of the
local swimming team shows more
than average strength in the dash-
es; power in the specialties, and
a little more than average‘ abili-
ty in the relays. Taking these fac-
tors into consideration, the Blue
and Gold ought to come home from
the Eastern Intercollegiate Asso-
ciation covered with honors.
Last Friday and Saturday, the
natators won their twelfth and
thirteenth straight dual meets
against Case and Franklin and

Weather Hits
Springs Drills

 

Grid Practice Delayed;

May Start Monday

 

The subject which ‘is so much
taboo in intelligent and bright con-
versation suddenly turned around
and knocked the plans of Coach
Jock Sutherland and his assistants
for an early session of football
spring training for the proverbial
loop. It is the weather. The calm
and springlike days which Pitts-
burgh enjoyed for the past few
weeks led the football board to
move up the annual early drills.
But the unforseen shift caused the
indefinite postponement of sp-ring
drill. However, practice will prob-
ably ‘start this coming Monday,
March 14. »

Judging from ‘ the number of
men who have reported thus far,
this year’s squad will be one of
the biggest which ever came out
for the grid sport. The great num-
ber of new men swelled the total
far beyond all expectations. If the
statement encouraging all who like
football and really want to play
was intended to bring out a big
group, it achieved its purpose.

The initial practice will be the
coaches’ first opportunity to get
a line on the actual worth of the
numerous candidates. Many of the
men already have experience but
some are comparatively green.
From this timber, it is the task of
the coaches to mould a strong
line for Pitt’s entire line of last
year is lost. No coach can lose an
all-America forward ‘wall and not
feel blue. The Panther backfield
for next year will compare favor-
ably with the best in the country.

Evidently Sutherland realizes the

size of the task confronting him,
for he said:

“I’m expecting a great deal of
my line material. »I ‘think most of
the rough edges will have been
smoothed off by fall practice. The
men must work hard, however, to
do this. And they've got to come
through.”

Condition for Local
Championship Battle

 

A battered Tech mitt team and an equally battered Pitt

Panther meet tomorrow night at Tartan gym.
Tech started the season out with a team that seemed head-

ed for collegiate boxing heights, but sickness and ineligibility

out the personnel down to mediocre caliber.

For the ﬁrst part

of the season, Tech had two sure winners in J elf Burke and
Jack Croissant. Burke, who won his three ﬁghts by knockouts,

was declared ineligible on account.%

‘of grades. Burke was looked upon

as one of the district's best 155

pounder. *
Croissant, who fought at 175

pounds packed a terrific punch,
but due to an. injury suffered at
Syracuse, was declared out for
the season.

Lose Two Men

Orsini, ‘after developing a team
that proved good enough to tie
Army, the conquerors not Penn
State, saw his squad cut down
overnight. Shotwell, who fought at
165 pounds, and Namlick, varsity
125 pounder, took sick over the
week-end and will be unable to
fight for quite a time.

Both coaches can be well par-
doned for removing large portions
of cranial foliage when they look
over their squads that have been
hit hard by bad luck and sickness.

Pitt seems to have the better
conditioned squad at present, but
the fact that the Tech bout will
be Pitt's third in seven days may
prove too much for the endurance

. of the Pitt men. -

However, both coaches are point-
ing for these bouts and hope to
give their fans something to
write home about.

Use Same Boxers

Both Orsini and Sesto will likely
use the men that have engaged in
most of the bouts to date, and the
opener in the 115 pound class,
will likely find McCarrell and
Wertz swapping punches. McCar-
rel has the weight advantage
over Wertz, and should score the
first Pitt victory.

If Namlick is sufficiently re-
covered from his recent illness
he will be Orsini’s choice for the
125 pound class. Tech will likely
rely on Ralph Atlas. Atlas pos-
sesses much more experience than
Namlick, but the bout seems to be
a tossup.

Frazer Hellegers, of Tech, will
have the choice of Martin, Schempf
orsanticola in the 135 pound bout

.with Schempf having the inside
track to fight for the Panthers.

Rubbo will meet one of the best
145 pounders in collegiate circles
in Henry Carr. Carr has defeated
Hamilton, of West Virginia, twice
and Rubbo has been defeated twice
by Hamilton. Carr ranks a top-
heavy favorite to take this fight.

Schricker Meets Pouncey

Schricker seems headed for an-
other victory when he touches
gloves and chin with Pouncey, of
Tech. Pouncey was a member of
last year’s team and is not an
easy mark for any fighter. From
past performances, h o w e v e r,
Schricker should «take the ﬁght.

Jerry O’Toole will carry Plaid
colors in the 165 pound bout
against “Cowboy” Siegel. Both
boys are on their respective squads
for the first year, and the bout
may go either way.

Tom Waldron may win the 175
pound bout from Pitt on a forfeit
unless-Orsini produces a fightéi‘
in this class. It is quite unlikely
that this will take place, and
Tech is just about sure of a vic-
tory in that division.

Tech Eager for Victory

Past performances will mean
nothing when the two teams
clash tomorrow night, and as the
Tech boys have been beaten in
every sport so far by the Panthers
they are in the right frame of
mind to upset Pitt.

On paper, the teams seem even-
ly matched, but Tech's squad is
better balanced than Pitt’s, and
the bout that Pitt may have to
forfeit may cost it victory. Car-
negie Tech seems headed for its
first triumph over a Pitt team
this season.

Six Varsity Riflemen
Make Perfect Scores

 

Something novel in the way of
rifle scores came to light last week
when six members of the rifle
squad came through with a perfect
score of 100, firing from a prone
position.

Captain Bachen. Spurgeon Wuer-
tenberger, Bob Wilson, Cliff Franz,
Charley Zoller and Walter Taussig
turned out to be the perfect marks-
men.

The feat is more difficult than it
seems at first thought. To make
the perfect score, the gunners had
to place ten bullets in a circle fif-
teen hundredths of an inch in di-
ameter, from a distance of fifty
feet.

Inmates of the Helping Hand, the

phony orchestra.
The orchestra, under the direc-
tion of M. S. Rocereto, will play a

Phi Kappas
Get Surprise

Phi Gamma Delta Victor;
Kappa Sigs Ahead

With Hart Morris and Don Davis
“on,” the Phi Gams sprang a big
surprise in the interfnaternity bas-
ketball league and defeated the Phi
Kaps to tie with their victims for
second place behind the leading
Sig Alphs in Section B. Both boys
scored eight points in their team’s
20-17 triumph with the floor work
of Davis being as big a factor in his
team’s victory as his scoring eye.

The Sig Alphs and the Phi Kaps
tangle Tuesday night in the feature
battle of this section. It the former
team wins, the race will be over.
If it loses then all three teams
mentioned above will be in a triple
tie for the leadership.

The Kappa Sigs all but put the
section A toga in the mothballs‘
when they conqueredthe Delts last
Thursday, 13-10., Ben Delello, the
dribbling fool, traveled a. couple of
miles in his journeys up and down
the ﬂoor, but stopped enough to
send the ‘ball through -the cords
four times to insure his team the
victory.

The Kappa Sigs have but one
more game of importance on their
schedule, that with Lambda Chi
Alpha, which is in second place
with but one defeat charged against
it. A victory for the latter would,
tie the race up but the Lambda
Chis must still meet Sigma Alpha
Mu which held the Kappa Sigs to
a 19-18 score in an early season
tilt.

After next week's games come
the finals between the winners of
the two sectional crowns, the
games with the Carnegie Tech in-
terfraternity champions, and the
picking of the all-interfraternity
teams by the Pitt Weekly.

defeated the Skibo natators, 39-20.
This meet crowned Pitt as the
champions of the Eastern Intercol-
legiate Swimming Association as
well as the champions of the city.

Running time to form, John
Hanna, the brilliant Panther star
again stood in the limelight. After
trailing by more than three yards
at the 50 yard mark, he duplicated
the race he swam against Klunk,
the N. Y. U. s-tar, by beating Miller
of Tech, by inches in the 100 yard
free style. Besides winning the 100
he won the-140, his hpec-ialty, and
also came back to swim on the win-
ning relay team.

Carik,‘ as usual, won the fancy
diving, with George Schmieler cap-
turing the runner-up position. In ad-
dition to winning the diving, Carik
took a third in the 150 yard back-
stroke. The 200 yard breaststroke
saw Joe and George »S‘chmieler tak-
ing first and third respectively.

In the 50 yard dash, Adlersberg
won handily with Joe Schmieler;
third. The Panther also won the re-I
lay; Adlersberg, Reiley, J. Schmiel-I
er, and Hanna made up the team. ‘

One of the best relay teams in
the country is running this season
for the University of Pittsburgh.
The members of this team are two
third year men and two sopho-
mores, the third year men being
Woodford “Woody” Harris and
“Len" Monheim while the sopho-
mores are Bill Keller and Thomas
“Mike” Milligan.

Track experts of this district
who have seen the performances
of the group, predict a brilliant
record this season for the team.
Two weeks ago in a dual indoor
meet, it conquered the best West
Virginia could offer in a sprint re-
lay, and were prepared to repeat
the feat in a 4-5 mile relay when
the Mountaineers forfeited the
event.

Earlier in the season the relay
team went down to Morgantown to
the annual West Virginia Univer-
sity Invitation meet where they
took second in the 4-5 mile relay
and a third in the sprint relay. The
team was hardly able to do itself
justice then, however, because it
drew the outside lane on a six-
lane track. As an indication of this
the time of the Pitt team in the
heat of sprint relay was better than
that made by the final winner of
the event.

The relay team is not only ex-
ceptionally fast, but also versatile.
It runs everything from a sprint
relay in which each man runs 110
yards apiece to a mile relay in
which each man runs 440 yards.

Monheim Captain

Len Monheim, captain of the
track team, runs the first lap. Mon-
lheim hails from Elizabeth, Pa.,
{High school where he was 11 three
letter man for three years. ‘He was

a star in just about every sport ‘

that they had at the school and
he pulled down letters in football,
basketball and track. Monheim
ranks as one of the classiest grid
players ever turned out in the Mon-
,ongahela district. In fact, onegis
lstill regaled by tales of his prow-
,ess when he visits that district.
—Monheim was also an amateur box-
er of some skill before he entered
‘Pitt.

Len was ‘hainstay of the Eliza-
beth track team. He was a member

[of the mile relay team that took

second in Class B in the W. P. I.
A. L., championship meet. He join-
ed the freshman cross-country and
track teams and received his num-
erals. He has been letterman on
the track team for the past two
years and has been lead-off man
on the relay team also. Versatile
in track. as he is in all athletics,
Monheim has run everything from
the hundred yard dash to the half
mile. Len is a junior in the dental
school.

Woody Harris and Monheim
form the “Gabbo Twins” who have
received their names for an aston-
ishing liberality in the use of the
tongue. Harris has run on the same
relay team for two years. He
comes from Ambridge, where he
played baseball, never donning a
spiked shoe until he came to Pitt
and was urged to go out for the
freshman track team which he did
with great success. He received his
numerals on the frosh squad and
graduated to the varsity team. In
1930 he copped the A. M. A. 100
yard championship. That same
year he was fourth high point scor-
er for the Pitt varsity.

Harris Ready of; Go

Last year Harris was handi-
capped by illness and :was not
nearly at his best, This year he
is completely recovered and is set
to score plenty of points. In the
Pitt-Techdual meet of 1930, Harris
finished with Monheim and Vitulla
in a triple tie, in the 440 yard run,
one of the most unusual finishes
on record. Harris runs anchor in
the sprint relay and third in the
mile relay. He also, is a junior in
the dental school.

A third member of the relay
team is Tom Milligan, good-looking
and healthy sophomore. Tom is a
former Peabody 'High school runner
and he made a brilliant record
while in Peabody. He won the 100
yard dash in the Pittsburgh scho-
lastic championships two years in
a row and snagged the 100 and 220
yard clashes in the W. P. I. A. L.,
championships and Penn State In-
vitation meet also two years in ‘a
row. He is joint holder of the 100
yard dash record of the Geneva In-
terscholastics and the Pitt Inter-
scholastics, the -time being 10 sec-
Onds ﬂat. He has taken second in
the Pennsylvania State champion-
ships and a sixth in the National
Interscholastics at Chicago,

As a Peabody runner, Mike was
a member of the great mile relay
teams that Coach Hugh Lambie
turned out yearly. He ran for the
team that won the Pittsburgh High
school and the W. P. I. A. L. mile
relay championship twice. This

same team broke the W. P. I. A. L.
record, set a state record of 3:29 2-5
and took third in the national inter-
scholastics. Milligan also ran on
the Peabody half-mile relay team
that established a Pitt Interscho-
lastic meet mark of 1:33 seconds.
After graduating Peabody, Mike en-
tered Pitt and became one of the
stars on last year's frosh team. He
tied with Bill Keller as high point
scorer, making 40 points.

Leg Bothers Milligan

Mllligan has been handicapped at
times by two injuries to his leg. ‘He
hurt his knee in 1928 while prac-
ticing on the parallel bars and was
forced to stay out of high school
for a year, Two years later he hurt
his thigh at the Ohio State Relays.
These injuries occasionally bother
him" and he is frequently forced to
favor his leg while running. A big
fellow. he has won points in the
weight events, also and sometimes
he goes -so far as the broad jump.
He made twenty two points once in
a single meet against Shadyside.

Bill Keller is the last member of
the relay team. Bill won his first
fame at William Penn High school
in Harrisburg, Pa. While at high
school, Keller cut a wide swath in
the meets of his district and then,
entering wider fields, won the state
scholastic half-mile championship.
He also set a half mile record of
1:59 5-10 seconds. After graduation
from William Penn, Bill entered
Newark Prep school, and hung up a
new record for the 440 yard run in
the Harvard University Interscho-
lastic meet. ‘His time was, '50 2-5.
seconds. He was a member of the
mile and two mile relay team which
won at the Ohio Sate Relays.
Keller Does 49 3-5

Last year Keller made a sensa-
tional record as the Pitt frosh half
miler and quarter miler. He was
undefeated all year in his events,
making times of around 2 minutes
in the half and 49 3-5 seconds in
the shorter distance without being
pushed. ‘Bill is a Kappa Sig and
plays a fast game of basketball for
his frat. He is an honor student,
having a “B" average in his studies
and he is ranked as areal Olympic
possibility.

 

F rosh Quintet Opposes
State in Final Battle

With their string of thirteen
-straight victories snapped by the
blood-thirsty Mountaineers of West
Virginia Tuesday night, the Pan-
ther frosh team will attempt to end
its season with a victory when it
meets the strong Penn State first-
year team at the stadium pavilion
tomorrow night in a preliminary to
the varsity game between the two
schools.

The visiting cagers boast of an
undefeated record this year and are
anxious to repeat the victory which
they gained over the Panther
fro-sh last year. Bill Taylor, a
Pittsburgh boy, who was the big
gun for the Perry High team of
three years ago with Russ Ochsen-
hirt as his understudy, is a sub on
the ‘Lion frosh team.

Meet W. Va.

Pi Lambs, Greek Champs,
Face Mountaineers

 

 

The telegraphic bowling match
between the intxerfraternity cham-
pions of Pitt and 4 West Virginia
University should take place either
next Tuesday or Wednesday, if no
last minute hitch in the D1838 turns

up.

The Pitt
pion is Pi Lambda Phi. which took
the Pitt cup after marching through
stiff competition in the Greek tour-
nament. The final Mountaineer in-
terfrat winner will be either Kappa

Sigma or Sigma Nu, and it will be
one of these teams that will oppose
the Pi Lambs.

The Pi Lamb team will probably
‘be composed of Sam Sherman,
Lou Berman, Leonard Linton, Ben
Wei-ssman and Jerome Rosenberg.
These boys form a pretty classy
aggregation. Linton probably is the
best scorer of the lot, occasionally
breaking two hundred.

The teams will be made up of
five men, and the bowlers will use
duckpins and small balls. Each
man will bowl five strings and the
total number of games for each
team will be twenty-five. The to-
tal pin fall will decide the final
team winner.

The foul line will ‘be carefully
respected. A judge of fouls will be
present and the bowler who fouls
will be penalized,

The games will be bowled on
the same day and the same hour
but at different places. As soon as
posible after the games have end-
ed, the -scores will be wired by each
team to its opponent, the scores
will be compared and the final
winner determined.

Team Heads Appointed
For Intramurals

 

In order to gain additional infor-
mation on boxing prospects for
next year. an intramural boxing
tournament will be held during the
third week in May, with only
freshmen allowed to enter the
competition.

Any freshman is allowed to en-

ter and does not have to be a
member of the boxing classes to
compete.

There will be six or more groups
competing, and besides a silver
cup being awarded the winning
team, there will be medals for the
winner and runner-up in the fin-
als.

All entries must be handed to
the group managers and instruc-
tions will be given to each group
as a whole. Practice sessions will
be held also. The manager of each
group will be personally responsi-

appointed group captains, and any-
one desiring to fight should get in
touch with one of them: Louis
Rakita, Bill Parker, Tar Meredith,
William Be-atty, John Steele, and
Hal Fisher.

If the student finds it difficult
to get into touch with any of the
above, he should get in touch with
boxing coach Joe Orsini.

Two Debate Tzahms Here
To Oppose Pitt March 18

ro of the Pitt team. The debate will
take place at the Brushton Metho-
dist Episcopal church.

The same Washington University
team that Pitt met on the western
tour will oppose Samuel Strauss
and Cyril Jacobs in what will prob-

Councils’ Next Meeting

FTER WITHERING
through most of the year
in the complacency that should
come only when a job has been
well done, the calm of Student
Council was rudely interrupted
last week by the outburst of a
demand for election reform.
Since the meeting last week
at which a change in the elec-
toral procedure was voted
down because of the qualiﬁca-
tion which sought to prevent
any group}-of students from vot-
ing during a regular class pe-
riod, the air has been .ram-
pant with rumors of schemes ad-

vanced by members whose ire
has been stirred. These mem-
bers will submit their plans to
Council at its next meeting. In-
deed, the spirit which will pre-
vail at the session next Tues -
day evening will probably be
the hottest that the‘ campus
solons have experienced during
their tenure of office.

But despite the open Split
that has developed within the
group, the proposals for im-
provements in the present
method of conducting elections
seem to be earnest attempts.
It is hoped that Council will
conscientiously and zealously
consider the plans and that
the group will not treat them
with haste and prejudice.

Perhaps one way to assure
a. careful deliberation on the
part of Council would be for
a large student audience to at-
tend the session. In the pres-
ence of this group of interest-
ed students, Council would
hesitate to rush through any
half-way measure.

The meeting on Tuesday
promises to have other inter-
esting develéoments in addition
to action on the election pro-
cedure. Appointments of Sen-
ior Ball, Spring Festival and
coed chairman of the Festival
events will be made; the re-
port of the committee on stu-
dent health will be discussed
and deﬁnite action on a revi-
sion of the University tapping
ceremonies will be taken.

The meeting place is Heinz
House and the hour is 7 o'clock,
Tuesday evening.

burgh branch of the American

NDETERRED BY the per-

sistency of Old Man Win-

ter in hanging around, the Pitt

Weekly and the Pitt Panther

bring to the campus this after-

noon, their second annual
Spring Fashion Revue.

This year, the revue will be
something more than just a
display of frocks for coeds and
suits for men. It will prove of
direct beneﬁt to every student
attending because of the inter-
esting and helpful hints about
correct dress that will be given
by Miss Grace Ely, art consult-
ant in the department of Re-.
tail Training.

The revue was made possible
through the cooperation of the
Fintex Clothing Company, Mc-
C.reery’s, Regal Shoe ‘Company,
and Bishinger’s Hair Dressing
Shop.

A large audience is expected,
and those who go will undoubt-
edly ﬁnd the display entertain-
ing and helpful.

“Father of Education”
15‘ --———:-—-—--
N THIS BICENTENNIAL

year of the birth of Wash-
ington, it is rather interesting
to note that he held rather
ﬁrm convictions as to the value
of education. We associate
Washington so much with his
military and diplomatic
achievements that we some-
times forget that he was a sup-
porter of the fundamentals
which became an early part of
the American nation.

In his farewell address in 1796
he said: “Promote, then, as an
object of primary importance,
institutions for the general dif-
fusion of knowledge. In pro-
portion as the structure of a
government gives force to pub-
lic opinion, it is essential that
public opinion «should be en-
lightened.”

In a statement made in 1788,
Washington observed, “in a
country like this, where every
man may reap his own harvest
which by proper attention will
afford him much more than is
necessary for his own con-
sumption, if there cannot be
money found for education,
there is something amiss in the

COLLEGES

Lingerie Line

Are students so naive? The U. of
Southern California is suing the
='lady who lives next door and in-
sists upon hanging her clothes out
in plain sight of the students-
much to their embarrassment.

“Alfalfa Bill"

H. L. Mencken who says that
college students don't take enough
interest in politics should look to-
ward New England. An “Alfalfa
Bill” Murray for President club
has been formed by Harvard fresh-
men.

Berlln Sport

“Friendly” duels are still legally
enjoyed by U. of Berlin students.
Despite the decided decline of this
sport since the war, it is still quite
popular. The duellists stick each
other until both have received
scars enough not to ,be ashamed
of, and then join their comrade in
a drinking bout.

“Whassamatta”

Walter Winchell will get the
shock of his blessed-eventful life
when he pauses in the midst of his
perambulations to read that Dr.
Allen Sinclair Will of the Colum-
bia School of Journalism has labeled
the Broadway slanguage as “re-
ceding into the jargon of the
jungle.”-—On the other hand we
can see Winchell, a. primitive look
in his eye, murmuring a savage.
“oh, yeah!"

Letter Home

If the old man has kicked about
your grades recently, or your fail.-
ure to obtain a job as college presi-
dent, clip this out and send it home
—-—Dr. Frank E. Williams, psychia-
trist has stated, "The hope that
Willie is bound to be next president
of the U. S., is plain silliness. It is
far more likely that children will
turn out to be just decent, ordinari-
1y fine, average adults like the rest
of us.”

 

“Bo'lted" Classes

At the U. of Michigan, students
“bolt” a. class rather than “cut” it-
but the good old college spirit for
skipping dreamy lectures and book-
ish froth is still there. A missed
class by any name is still just as
sweet.

 

Pig Race

They're having a great time out
in Honolulu. According to the “Ka
Leo 0 Hawaii” the college sheet at
the U. of Hawaii, a pig hunt was re-
ported as follows: “We saw a pig.
The pig ran fast, and the dogs were
fast, and we chased them so fast.
We didn’t get the pig, however; we
got a goat.”

15 Cents Worth

“Jailbirds Earn 15 Cents a. Day
to Go to College’’— so read a head-
ing in the Minnesota Daily. Forty
men in the state penitentiary are
now engaged in the corresponding
department of the U. of Minnesota.

 

Chapell Game
In order to add a little life to the
chapel period students at Texas
Christian U. play bridge during the
proceedings.

 

Fairy Tales

The Governor of Homan Province
in China, has forbidden the use of
“Alice in Wonderland” in the school
declaring that it is a method of
teaching students untruths.

A professor of Ohio State on the
other hand told students to read
fairy tales rather than the “bunk”
that is now published as literature.

 

Dumb Klucks

Here are a few of the boners that
the students at Boston U. pulled in
exams: Theodore Dreiser is one of
the probable Democratic candidates
for President; water is defined as
being composed of two gins, bxygen
and hydrogin (oxygin is pure gin,
while hydrogin is gin and water);
“summum bonum” means “some
bum, some good" The death of
Socrates was caused by an overdose
of wedlock. In 1658 the Pilgrims
crossed the ocean, this being known
as ‘‘Pilgrim’s Progress.” An eye doc-
for is an optimist, whereas a pessi-
mist looks after your feet. Irving
Fisher, noted economist at Yale,
was the creator of “Mutt and Jeff.”

Engineer Discoveries
Bring Pitt to Front

Research engineering has devel-
oped at Pitt to such an extent that
the school holds a commanding po-
sition in the world of science.

This is -in part due to the close
affiliation to Mellon Institute of In-
dustrial Research and Westing-
house Electrical and Manufactur-
ing Company, both of which offer
lecture courses to undergraduates
and part time service for graduates.
Electrical and mechanical work in
radio and television, are being
studied by engineers at the latter
plant, Experiments on new devices
are being conducted, and, under
this system, basic patents are be-
ing discovered.

Graduates who show promise of
originality are being commended to
the graduate schools and facilities
are offered for individual research.

In chemistry and metallurgy, the
field is broadening continuously,
and industry is beginning to realize
that research will help to keep

Letters

To the Editor:

As a passing commentary
upon the way many things are
done at Pitt, it does “seem
strange that pictures for the
Owl could not be taken in a
more suitable place than the
antiquated, chilly_and condemn-
ed Faculty garage.

Many groups were assigned a
time when their pictures were
to be taken for the yearbook,
and they gathered their mem-
bers »in the garage. Forced to
wait as long as half an hour for
the camera, they were certainly
inconvenient and uncomfort-
able in the cold, damp atmos-
phere of the poorly heated
rooms.

The delay may not have been
the fault of the Pitt Owl staff,
but certainly there are other
places about the University
that could have been secured.
There must be rooms that could
have been had at small or no
cost, and which would have
served as well for the purpose.
Would not a classroom, even
be better than the Faculty ga-
rage? It surely would offer the
advantages of heat and comfort
in case a delay was necessary.

It seems to this writer that
the members of the Owl staff
would build up considerable
good-will for their publication
it‘ they were to consider_ small
matters like this, for it is just
such incidents which will lose
patronage and favor.

Seeking to prevent organizations
that have no direct connection
with Pitt from holding social
events in the name of the Univer-
sity, Student Relations committee
has started an intensive effort to
obtain copies of «the constitutions
of all recognized student activities
and associations.

According to Cyril Jacobs, Bus.
Ad, ’32, the committee is deter-
mined to stop groups from .register-
ing events in Pittsburgh hotels up-
on representing themselves to be
affiliated with the University. When
a complete list of all recognized
campus organizations and activi-
ties has been obtained, c)pies of
this list will probably be provided
for hotels and other renting and
booking agencies in the city, Ja-
cobs said.

In order to obtain the complete’
list at the earliest possible time,
Student Relations Committee has
requested all campus organizations
to submit their constitution and a
list of present officers to the com-
mittee within the next ten days.
