The Institutional Review
Board of the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center is
asking Pitt transplant doctors to
modify their treatment proce-
dures before performing anoth-
er baboon-to-human liver trans-
plant.

“Based on the experience of
the first transplant, doctors are
going to modify the treatment
procedures. The patient con-
sent form will be changed to
reflect these modifications,”
UPMC spokesperson Lisa Rossi
said. A

Sutherland
residents
still waiting
for services

By Matt Groff
Staff Writer

Students living in Sutherland

is a price to pay for living in
Pitt’s first new dorm complex
in decades. As the novelty of
Sutherland wears off, students

about lingering inconveniences
and delays.

“We pay more than anyone
else to stay on campus and
nothing is finished. They told
us it would be completely
done by the beginning of
October, and here ‘it is the mid-
dle of October and the com-
mons still isn’t open,” East
Sutherland resident Lisa Fitz
said.

According to Pitt’s
Department of Housing and
Food Services‘, the cafeteria at

"Sutherland is scheduled to
open during the first week of
November. Many of the ser-
vices in Sutherland Commons,
such as the mail room, are
scheduled to open sometime
this week. T '

“How is it that they can build
an entire garden in front of
these dorms, but yet they can’t
open the mail room or give us
access to pay phones,” said
Celeste Ponetto, a residentof
East Sutherland.

Bob Marx, president of the
Resident Student Association of
Sutherland Hall, is one person
involved in trying to respond to
some of the residents’ com-
plaints.

“On the surface it looks to

Marriott plans opening of Union patio cafe for spring

By Frank Porco
Staff Writer

Pitt students will have the opportu-
nity to dine outside when springtime
arrives.

Assistant Director of Housing Harry
Burner said the plans for the outside
café, which would be located on
Bigelow Patio. of the William Pitt

Union, have been approved.

“The carts have been ordered, and
we will then wait until the nice
weather breaks again before we
offer this service outside,” Burner
said. ‘

General Manager for Marriott Jim
Jenkins said the outside café was
supposed to be ready for the
fall term, but a delay in the deliverv

of the food carts is what held them
back from_ going through with the
plans. '

“Since our plans have been put on
hold until the spring, we plan on get-
ting some input from the students on
what kind of food they would want to
have for an outdoor café,” Jenkins
said.

Jenkins said the plans will go

.#‘@3"§G3~‘G' #973959’ :i‘O'.$"‘®'«3"@' .2t*G)".$*‘®

through with the outside cafe in the

spring term when the weather is
agreeable.

Housing and Marriott are very excit-

. ed about the plan. “The more quality

locations we can provide for

food services the better, our goal is

to provide food service to every I

location around campus,” Burner
said.

Students will have to complete
obstacle courses as they battle

Friday evening will be the
Homecoming Bash with a fire-
works show by Zambelli as
well as a laser show. Both
shows will be choreographed
to music and can be seen at 9
p.m. between the Cathedral
and the union, Misuraca saidv.

Immediately following the
shows on Friday, students can
continue the Bash celebration
in the WPU with free music
from The Clarks, Pure Gold
and opening act Stinging Rain.

“The bash afterwards will be
a great chance for students and
alumni to mingle. The music is
free so they will be able to
roam around, visit, eat, really
relax and have a good time,”
Misuraca said.

The coronation of the 1992
Homecoming king and queen
will occur at halftime Saturday

afternoon when the Panthers
play East Carolina in the
Homecoming game, Misuraca
said.

Lim said the Homecoming
cruise takes place Saturday
night on board The Majestic for
Monte Carlo night. Dinner,
dancing and a D]. will also be
available.

Misuraca said that students
will be able to win chips at
Monte Carlo and use them for
an auction later on in the night
in which they will have the
chance to win the grand prize
— two tickets to anywhere in
the continental United States on
USAir or other prizes provided
by local merchants.

Misuraca said he is quite con-
fident that this year’s home-

can kill.”

The special early registration for
seniors was also discussed at the
meeting. Golden said that undergradu-
ate seniors with 84 credits or more
will be able to register for classes
early for the second consecutive term.

Golden also said that it is the job of
the advisors to make sure that seniors
with less than 84 credits do not regis-
ter at this time.

Early registration was established so

seniors could get the classes that they
need for graduation before the classes
close. The early registration will take
place Oct. 29 through 30.

Other issues addressed at the SGB
meeting include:
OSGB member Bryan Bender said that
he did not like to see people tearing
down homecoming posters. ’
-The Freshmen Council is becoming
active with 53 members. It is working
on Choice Dollars, renovation of resi-
dence halls and campus safety.

OSGB member Barbara Rodriguez said
that a few first-year students have
come to her with complaints that a
General Writing professor cannot
speak English. She will be filing a for-
mal complaint with the English
Department.

OSGB member Derrick St. Clair said
that the SGB will look at improving
recycling on the campus.

-There will be an ad hoc committee
created to investigate landlords.

°Rose Donovan was announced as

the new SGB Governmental
Committee chair. _
-Adam Novak was appointed to the
SGB Multicultural Committee.
°Golden suggested a loudspeaker or
bullhorn to be put on the William Pitt
Union porch for public debate. He
said that they are popular at Berkeley
and the.University of California at San
Diego. Students could praise or make
their concerns known.

-A committee was approved to

every 10 minutes. A larger
shuttle is also being consid-
ered.”

Marx said another major
problem is that Sutherland
lacks a sense of community
thus far, many people stay in
their rooms and are not familiar
with most of their neighbors.

“We are still waiting for TVs
to be placed in the lounges.
When they come,iI think that
will help people meet others
from their floor,” Marx said.
“Also, when the commons
opens up and the cafeteria
starts operating, students will
realize who the other
Sutherland residents are.”

Marx said that he expects
Sutherland to develop a fairly
close community, especially
since it is so far from the other
dorms. Sutherland’s branch of
RSA plans to be very active and
bring the residents together for
various activities. He said that

since everything is still in its
early stages, it is a good time
for students to raise their voic-
es to change the system in
order for it to serve them best.
Despite the inconveniences,
most Sutherland residents con-
tend that they live in the best
dorm on campus. Larger
rooms, quiet halls and cleaner,
more private bathroom facilities
were cited by several students
as important benefits of living

_in Sutherland. It also gives

advantages to segments of the
student population such as the
Greeks (its close proximity to
several of the houses) and ath-
letes. .

“I consider Sutherland a big
improvement from Forbes Hall.
Besides the nicer rooms and
facilities, it’s more convenient
to go to practice,” football play-
er Ray Belvin said. “It’ll be a lot
easier to make those early
morning practices in the
spring.”

SGB President  hire

In Tl1ursday’s edition of The Pitt News an advertise-
ment was placed by the Student Government Board
urging students to run for SGB president so that they
could get tuition reimbursements. The ad started like
this:

“Interested in getting TUITION REIMBURSEMENT?

Run for Student Government President 

Something is wrong with this picture. Simply stated,
monetary perks have never been the motivating factor
for past SGB presidents. They should not be the moti-
vating factor for future candidates either.

We realize the controversy surrounding this issue and

I concede several points to both sides of the fence.

Tuition reimbursement has both its good and its bad
points. However, to induce candidates solely by appeal-
ing to their greed is both wrong and unethical. .

For one thing, we do not want a president whose
main purpose for running is to get reimbursed. The stu-
dent government president for a major university like
Pitt has a lot of responsibility. We like to think that the
current SGB president accepted the job because he
cared about the needs of the students. We would like to
think the same thing of the next president ‘

Secondly, there was a huge amount of controversy
surrounding this issue. There were several students’
groups on campus -—— the University Democrats, College
Republicans, and BiGALA among them — who were
able to separate their political differences and come out
against this reimbursement. But this advertisement
could be seen as trivializing the actions of these groups.
They were strongly against this reimbursement and
organized a non-partisan group against it. 9

As the so-called representative of the student body,
this shows a large degree of insensitivity on the part of
SGB’s Elections Committee Board. Although represent-
ing a polarized facet, student groups are closer to the
‘student body than SGB is. A unified coalition represent-
ed the opinionsof many students. The elections board

‘should have realized this. The advertisement was insult-

ing.
Not too long ago when the issue of reimbursement

‘was being criticized by several student organizations,

we asked SGB and the administration involved a ques-
tion. We asked them if they would take this issue to ref-
erendum so that the students involved could decide.
Nobody listened, which makes us wonder how commit-
ted thesetwo groups are to the needs and desires of
students — especially since the voice of a large ;non—
partisan coalition was virtually ignored. \

We didn’t have an opinion about this reimburse-
ment, we simply asked for a referendum. We remain
committed to that idea —‘ the idea of proper represen-

tation for students.

NAFTA will cause nothing but grief

The American debate over
the impending North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
between the United States,
Canada and Mexico continues.
The pro-NAFTA side says it will
create more jobs in the United
States and Mexico and give the
U.S. economy a boost. The anti-
NAFTA side says U.S. corpora-
tions will take their factories to
Mexico where they can pay
poverty level wages. Only time
will tell which side is right. '

NAFTA is seen by many as an
economic agreement — noth-
ing else. Its primary goal is cor-
porate profits. However, what
many fail to take into account is
the question of social justice.
The only attention NAFTA pays
to environmental concerns, for
instance, is toreduce standards
as much as possible.

According to the agreement,
any laws that inhibit free trade
will be revoked. Ralph Nader
said this includes “any factors
other than commercial ones.
Arguments about consumers’
health, worker safety or envi-
ronmental irnpacts wouldn’t be
allowed.” ’

U.S. environmental laws
would be repealed by the
smallest amount of corporate
whining. They’ll say they can’t
compete with Mexican corpora-
tions who follow almost non-
existent environmental laws.

If you don’t think U.S. corpo-
rations will take advantage of
these opportunities, they
already have. The United States
signed an identical free trade
agreement with Canada in 1989
(which Canadians regret due to
losing an estimated 460,000
jobs). After corporate America
criticized Canada’s weak acid
rain laws as an unfair practice,
U.S. acid rain laws were
reduced. .

Since 1965 U.S. factories have
been moving to Mexico. They
have polluted the area by
dumping their waste. Mag-
ztilctdoras (foreign—owned facto-
ries) are a good example of
what NAFTA will bring. With

/ The

over 2,000 U.S. maquiladoras in
Mexico, it is obvious that it’s
more profitable to pollute there.

And it’s also obvious that com-

panies aren’t hesitating to relo-
Cate.

largest number of
maquiladoras is at the Texas-
Mexico border —— along the Rio
Grande. Hazardous waste
dumping into this river has
ruined the area’s vital water
supply. The level of contamina-

Josh
Obusek

tion in the Rio Grande is 1,000
times the Texas limit. An
American Medical Association
scientific panel has concluded
that a continuation of the
“uncontrolled” polluting by
unregulated factories is severely
threatening “the health and
future economic vitality on both
sides of the border.”

Mexico is the legal loophole
for corporations seeking to
evade the hard—fought,gains of
environmentalists. With over
2,000 maquilacloras in place
without a free trade agreement,
the inevitable degradation that
will occur once NAFTA is a
reality is frightening. The agree-
ment shouldn’t be called free
trade, it should be called toxic
trade.

There is more to NAFTA than
environmental destruction. In

Mexico we are dealing with a

dictatorial political machine.
Despite. what it calls itself,
Mexico is as much a democracy
as East Germany was. The
Institutional Revolutionary Party
(PR1) has been “elected” to the
government every year since
1929. In its most recent
Presidential election Mexico’s
vote-counting machines broke
down the day before the elec-
tion. But the PRI candidate
Carlos Salinas won anyway. It is

‘ no wonder that they are fre-

quently accused of election
fraud.

The police powers of PRI are
frequently used to suppress dis-
sent. Andrew Reding of the
World Policy Institute and
Chistopher Whalen, editor of
the Mex-iccm Report, a Mexican
newspaper, detailed the situa-
tion: “a strong pattern of rights
abuses and state—sponsored vio-
lence persists. Torture is univer-
sal  dozens of journalists,
more than 1,000 members of
political opposition parties and
a prominent human rights advo-
cate have been murdered since
Salinas took office.”

By owning more than half of
Mexico’s commercial assets, PRI
also controls most of Mexico’s
business. Mexican presidents
make fortunes for themselves
through state enterprises. Their
money is used to build a huge
network of political and busi-
ness allies, further enabling
them to suppress dissent. The
Mexican Workers Confeder-
ation, a.PRI controlled union,
actively suppresses any de-
mands for free unions and bet-
ter wages.

Another troubling fact con-
cerning thisdictatorship is that

over $10 billion in U.S. tax dol-

lars goes to Mexico each year.
The US. government should
demand real democracy in
Mexico. Instead Mexico uses
our money to help support a

‘repressive, environmentally

destructive dictatorial party.
NAFTA is expected to be
passed by Congress and signed
by the president. It seems that
either (1) they don’t know the
facts or (2) they don’t care.

Political columnist William. 9.

Greider put it best: “Kidnap-
ping, torture, murder; amid
such brutal rule, free trade. can
be nothing more than a hollow
phrase. Bush’s proposed treaty
with Mexico is like signing a

free trade agreement with South '

Africa and pretending not to
notice that blacks have no
rights.”

Van Pelt leads late

By Rob Pugliese -

Sports Assistant

PHILADELPHIA, Pa. — When
two teams with three wins
between them meet in mid-
October, it usually does not make
for exciting football.

And Saturday afternoon was no
different until the final two min-
utes.

The atmosphere was anything
but inspiring as Temple and Pitt
battled listlessly before a sparse
Veterans Stadium crowd gener-
ously listed at 17,470. Nothing
spectacular loomed on the
Panthers’ horizon, especially after
Temple’s Rich Maston drilled a
32-yard field goal to knot the
score at 20 with 1:38 left to play.
Pitt faced the harsh reality of a tie
with the Owls — not exactly an
achievement worth gloating
about.

But Alex Van Pelt and the
Panther offense shifted crisply
into high gear, churning out a
majestic 80-yard drive that culmi-
nated on Lyron Brooks’ one-yard
plunge with just 13 seconds
remainingtto lift Pitt past. Temple
27-20. “ ‘

It was the second touchdown
of the day for Brooks, a first-year
fullback who was?’ originally
tabbed as a redshirt this season.
Brooks said the Panthers were

_ determined not to walk away
with a tie. '

“_I don’t think we would appre-
ciate that much,” Brooks said. “It

would have been just like a loss -

to us.” .
It took the Panthers just nine

plays to march those final 80

yards with Van Pelt so crisp and

poised that Pitt did not even-use '

any of its remaining timeouts.
Van Pelt completed six of
seven passes on the drive and 10
of 11 for 101 yards in the fOU1'l‘_l1
quarter. This finished off an after-

noon in which he broke the ’

10,O0O-yard barrier on a 15-yard
completion to tight end Raymond
Belvin on the game’s opening
drive. A . l

- However, ‘the biggest play of
the winning drive came courtesy’
of Van Pelfs legs rather than his
arm. Pitt faced a third down and

5, four at the Temple eight-yard line

when Van Pelt kept the ball on a

naked bootleg oil‘ the right side.
He rolled down to the Temple
one, setting up Brooks’ score.
“Oh  we needed that drive,”
Pitt head coach Paul Hackett said.

“It was a great drive at the end of 5

the game. If it hadn’t been Van

really felt if anybody could do it,

Van Pelt could do it. What can
you say about his poise? He just

pleted every pass, plus put the
thing in the end zone.”

“I think it was a total team
win,” Van Pelt said. “When it
came down to it, the defense.had
to hold them to at least a field
goal and they did that. And the
offense came on. We think were
one of the better two-minute
offenses in the country.”

“We were sloppy [on
. defense] at times, but we held
when we had to,” Hackett said. '
Pitt jumped on top early, tak-
ing the opening kick—off and
driving 69 yards on 11 plays.
The drive culminated on
Colicchio’s eight-yard scoring
run off the left side. The key
play of the drive came on third-
and-four from the Temple 27-
yard line when Van Pelt found
Belvin loose over the middle
for 15 yards and a first down.
Temple scored when
Paliscak fired a 25-yard scoring

Washington. That finished off a
10-play, 65-yard drive.

Pitt anwered with a nice mix-
ture of runs and short passes
on an 11-play, 56-yard drive
that culminated on Sean
Conley’s 44-yard ﬁeld goal.

Paliscak was knocked out of
the game just before halftime
on a jarring hit by defensive
end Matt Hosilyk.

strike over the middle to Wilbur‘

First—year player Luke Linhart
came on for Paliscak and his
desperation heave was i_nter-
cepted by I.ex Perkins to end
the first half.

The Pitt defense came out
strong in the third quarter.
Charles Williams intercepted
Linhart on the opening series,
putting the Panther offense in
business at the Temple 30. An
apparent touchdown toss from
Van Pelt to Billy Davis was nul-
lified by an illegal touching
penalty so Pitt settled for a 47-
yard ﬁeld goal by Conley.

Temple return man Marc
Baxter set the Owls up at the
Pitt 31 with a nice 25-yard
return. Ralphiel Mack and
Efrain Cabrera pounded the
ball down to the 12. The Pitt
defense came up with a crucial
stop, thwarting a reverse to
Baxter for a three—yard loss on
fourth-and—two to end the

‘ drive.

Temple opened the final
stanza with an abbreviated field

goal drive to cut Pitt’s lead to
13-10.

Pitt responded with a clock-
consuming 11—play, 91-yard
drive that finished off with
Brooks smashing in from ﬁve
yards out.

The touchdown was set up
by Colicchio’s 30-yard burst to
the five.

Just 44 seconds later, Linhart
hooked up with a streaking
Lew Lawhorn on a 51-yard
touchdown pass that sliced the
Owls’ deficit to 20-17.

Temple got the ball back at
its own 45 on a Colicchio fum-
ble. Solid Panther defense
forced Temple to settle for a
32-yard field goal by Maston.
This set the stage for Van Pelt’s
heroics.

“Our defense —-—- right when
we had to have them hold 
they had to hold for a ﬁeld goal
for the tie. And that’s something
we have not done this year,”
Hackett said. .“We have not
been able to hold on.”

A little help from above did
not hurt either.

“Our whole offense stems
from how good we play
defense,” Dyer said. “Today,
we played defense rather well
—- with [Adam] Spitzer in goal,
J.L. lGorsin], everybody. In the
second half we started taking
it to them — beating them to
the ball.

“But still, we had God on
our side today.”

Whether it was divine inter-
vention or divine defense, the
victory was not only a proba-
ble clincher for the team’s
playoff hopes but a positive
step in getting back on track
for a possible berth in the
NCAA tournament.

The fact that the team came
through when it had to is a
welcome sight for senior for-
ward Scott Alexander.

“I think that everybody real-

ized that if we came through
with a win here, then it bet-
ters our chance to go to the
final four,” Alexander said.
“You don’t know what’s going
to happen [the rest of the sea-
son], but we needed to get
back on course.

“Tonight, we got back on
course.”

In addition to righting the
course, Alexander, Dyer and

the restof the Pitt team gained ,

a measure of revenge on its
conference opponent -— who,
like every other league foe,
talked that talk but couldn’t
walk Pitt’s walk.

“Every team [talks trash] to
us,” Alexander said. “They
were out there saying ‘you
guys are nothing’.and ‘we’ve
got this game easy.’

“Our team [concept] stems
from defense: we get our
opportunities, put them in the
goal and we win.?’

Pitt’s next game is at home
this Wednesday against
Canisius. Game time is 7:15

Eric Enigman/The Pitt News

Penn State at times on Saturday, but the Lions came away with the 8-0 win.

Volleyball    

Continued from page 10

Behind the outstanding sewing
(10 aces), as well as the play of
five-foot-ten-inch junior outside
hitter Ann Marie Lucanie (14
kills, .542 hitting percentage)
and 5-11- first—year middle hitter
Alyssia Yanik (seven kills, .400
hitting percentage), the
Panthers juiced Syracuse handi-
ly in about an hour.

“We had good movement on
defense and got great setting
from Annie [Mernagh],” head
coach Sue Woodstra said. “It
was a very smooth match.”

On Thursday, Woodstra gar- A

nered her 100th career victory
but downplayed its significance
in light of the rest of the season
ahead.

“It’s nice, but it’s just one
game,” she said. “We have a lot
of matches left to play, and
there are more important things
to work for.” »

Among them is the Big East
‘regular season title, which the
Panthers have won the past
two years in a row since a reg-
ular season champion was first
crowned in 1990.

Despite losing two confer-
ence matches early on to
Villanova and Providence (their
first Big East losses in over four
years), Woodstra feels that the
Panthers still have a great shot
at winning the title again this
yean

“As long as we keep getting
better, and as long as the other
teams keep beating each other,
we have a good chance,” she

was lucky to lead at the half.

“We were so ﬂat in the first
half, offensively and defensive-
ly. Pitt just dominated us,” Hale
said.

The second half was
the same story. PRFC continued
to push the attack.

Eight minutes into" the half
it moved the ball to within
three feet of the scoring zone.

The Panthers controlled the
ball for four—and-a-half minutes
during the surge, but came
away empty—handed.

PRFC would get no closer.
Team captain Brian Stevenson
said he was upset with the
loss, but he was not intimidat-
ed by Penn State. _

“They’re not as good as they

claim to be,” Stevenson said.
“We definitely could have beat-
en them today.”

With just seven minutes to
go in the game, PSU forward
Jesse Schlegel picked up a
loose ball and dove into the
scoring zone. The play was
worth five points and washed
out any hopes of a Panther
upset. .

“We didn’t play well at all
and we still won,” Schlegel
said.

“It doesn’t matter if it’s foot-
ball or rugby, it’s still nice to
beat the Panthers.”

PRFC will play California
(Pa) this Saturday at Lower
Frick Park in Braddock. The
game is scheduled to start at 1

said.

However, Woodstra’s goals
for her team lie beyond the
regular season championship.

Woodstra feels the true
quest for Pitt will begin on
the weekend of Nov 21
and 22, when the Panthers
host the Big East Tournament.

“The [regular season] title
isn’t the most important thing
to worry about. I don’t want to
put that kind of pressure on
them,” she said. “I just want
them to play hard and be
ready by the time the Big East
Tournament rolls around.
That’s what we’re working
for.” '

Early on against Hofstra
however, the Panthers looked
as if they were on vacation —-—
moving lethargically and with
little intensity. Hofstra’s pace
seemed to give the Panthers
problems in game one, as their
off—balance attack and
unorthodox play slowed the
game down.

“We should’ve been playing
at 10 times their pace,”
Woodstra said. “We play really
hard against fast teams like
Long Beach State [the third
ranked team in the nation] and
then play undisciplined against
Hofstra and down to their
level. We can’t continue to do
that.”

The play of 5’9” first—year
outside hitter Sara Mitchell (14
kills) brought the team from
behind in game one to a 12-10
lead. Hofstra pulled to within
one at 13-12, but three straight
stellar blocks by Mikla
gave the Panthers game one,
15-12.

Game two was all Hofstra,
as the Dutchwomen capital-
ized on poor Panther hitting
and serving.

Led by the play of 6—foot
sophomore outside hitter
Sarah Telford (11 kills) and 6-
foot senior middle blocker
Samantha Sylva (five blocks),
the Dutchwomen jumped
out to a commanding 9-2
lead and were never
threatened. Pitt narrowed the
gap to within five at 11-6, but
Hofstra took the second game
15-7.

In game three, the Panthers
came out with more intensity
and focus on offense, jumping
out to a quick 4-0 lead
and forcing Hofstra to call time
out.

The Panthers received a
spark from 6-foot sophomore
middle hitter Melanie

Gustafson, who energized the
sagging Panther attack with

good hustle and timely hitting.
A service ace by Gustafson
extended the Panther lead to
7-1, and good hitting and dig-
ging by Mitchell (14 kills, 24
digs) and Mikla (17 kills, .324
hitting percentage) sealed the
Dutchwomen’s fate as Pitt took
game three with ease, 15-8.

“Mel played very well for us
tonight,” Woodstra said.

Game four proved to be a
struggle, as I-Iofstra spotted Pitt
the first two points before run-
ning off four in a row to take a
4-2 lead. Pitt seemed flat to
start the game, hitting the ball
long numerous times and serv-
ing poorly. A kill by Hofstra’s
6’1” sophomore outside hitter
Nikki Holt increased the
Dutchwomen’s lead to 9-5,
forcing Pitt to call time out.

During the time out
Woodstra was furious and laid
into‘ her team for its uninspired
play and lack of effort.

“It gets frustrating some-
times,” she said. “Hofstra was
not very fast, and there was no
excuse for our play. This team
has to play with enthusiasm,
that is the only way good
things are gonna happen for
us.”

Pitt looked like a totally dif-
ferent team after the time
out. Serving aces by Gustafson
and 5’9” sophomore outside
hitter Chelsea Hemingway,
along with exceptional back
row play by Mitchell, gave Pitt
five straight points as it over-
took Hofstra for a 10-9 advan-

tage-
After at Hofstra time out, the
Panthers continued their

assault as Mikla, Gustafson and
Mitchell all powered home
spikes to take the game and
match, 15-12.

With the loss, Hofstra’s four-
game winning streak was
snapped, lowering its record to
8-4.

It has been a roller coaster
season for Woodstra and Co.
thus far, as one would expect
with a roster that includes four
first—year players and four
sophomore players, but
Woodstra said she feels the
the time has come to stop rely-
ing on youth as an excuse for
inconsistent play.

“I promise at the end of this
year I am never using the term
‘young players’ again,” she
said.

After Pitt’s strong showing
late in the I-Iofstra match, as
well as its impressive play
against Syracuse, she may not
have to.

“We are starting to come
into our own,” Woodstra said.
