"Seabees " Open
Enlistments For '

Men of 17 to 50

Lieut. Commander E. B. Keck-
ler, officer in charge of the Pitts-
burgh Navy Recruiting District,
has released the latest information
concerning the Navy’s construc-

‘tion battalions, the “Seabees.”

Eligible applicants for “Seabee”
enlistment or induction ‘(all crafts-
ment 17 to 50% years of age)
should apply at their nearest Navy
Recruiting Station any day ex-
cept Sunday from 8 o’clock in the
morning to 5 o’clock in the eve-
ning. Those 17 and those 38 to
50% will be processed immediately
if found physically qualiﬁed.

Those 18‘/to 37 inclusive who
qualify after a physical examina-
tion and an interview will receive
letters to their draft ‘board stat-
ing that they are volunteers for
immediate induction into the Navy.
They will be inducted and assigned
to the “Seabee” group when re-
leased by their draft boards.

Eligibles between 18 and 38 can
thus use their trade to ﬁght with

the Navy’s “Seabees,” and may be,

assigned advanced ratings depend-
ing upon applicant’s qualiﬁcations
and experience.

Similar to the Navy’s plan for
voluntary induction is the Army’s
opportunity for .. service with its
Army Engineers.

All applicants should have at

least three letters of recommend-I

ation from current and. previous
employers and also their birth
certiﬁcates when making applica-
tion. . ”

Navy Recruiting Stations are
located in the Old Post Office
building.

Men students who want to take .

the Army and Navy mental ex-
aminations at 9 o’clock today will
be excused from their classes, an-
nounces Rufus- Fitzgerald, vice-
Chancellor; Exams will last until
11 o’clock and students can get
oﬂicial excuses from examination
oﬂicers.

These Army and Navy mental
examinations will be given in Me-
morial Hall.

To remedy the situation which

exists due to the fact that the
engineering school is not repre-
sented on ESGC, _the members
agreed to admit one engineering
student who will be able to pre-
sent engineering problems, and
thus aid in bringing about friend-
lier feelings between the dilfer-
ent groups. David P. Sommerville,
instructor in mechanical ‘engi-
neering and advisor to the Engi-
neering and Mines cabinet, and
eight engineers attended this
meeting. John Kleissas, Ed43.
was recommended by E & M
cabinet Wednesday afternoon to
represent them on ESGC. Action
on this recommendation will be
taken next week.

Due to the lack of student inter-
est and the departure of men for
the armed services, it‘ is probable
that Spring festival program will be ‘
greatly reduced or entirely elimi-
nated, according to Lee McFadden,
BA44, chairman pro tempore, at
ESGC’s last meeting.

Freshman Ciirl  
Gets Gov't Job

No longer is it true that only
Seniors get the ‘breaks, so says
Grace Davis, C46, a South Hills
High graduate, and, a Pre-nursing
student at Pitt.

This summer during July and
August, Grace will be one of the
two ﬁeld inspectors to be sent by the
Bureau of Entomology of the De-
partment of Agriculture to try to
exterminate the Japanese beetle.
She and her companion will visit
the greenhouses in West Virginia
inspecting the plants for this
beetle. ’ ‘ —

The beetle was brought "to th
United States on a Japanese bar-
berry plant in the state of New
Jersey. It is now very prevalent
around the New Kensington area
of Pennsylvania and in neighbor-
ing States. The beetle destroys the
entire plant leaf and often the en-
tire fruit of the plant and is pre-
senting a serious problem to the
Bureau of Entomology at the
present time.

.i7Slide'-1'uling has received some
severe cri_ticism from” the engi-

neers. This was to be expected."

Each Junior and Senior represent-
ative in the Engineering » and
Mines Cabinet was speciﬁcally in‘-
structed on two separate occasions
to gather all news from their re-‘

spective departments and submit,‘

‘said news for insertion in Slide-

Unfortunately, the response was
extremely weak——so weak -that
only two members of the eighteen
in the Cabinet have offered in-
terest stories for Slide-ruling. And
they in turn reported only once
since Slide-ruling has appeared in
the Pitt News. So please ease your
criticism on the editor of Slide-
ruling and divert most of it on
your two E & MA representatives.

The engineers have been crying
for Pitt News recognition for a
long time. Now they have it and
don’t know what to do with it.
Let’s all get on the “ball” and
make a go of this thing. We’d
appreciate hearing more 0 news
from the Dean of Engineering Of-
ﬁce, faculty, officers of -honorary

Doctors’ Duties Increase

Because Of Air Cadets
Dr.iH. C. Carlson, head of the
Men’s Student Health service, 34th
ﬂoor Cathedral, ‘requests students
to call between 10:30 and)?» o’clock
for examinations, excuses, and oth-
er reasons except in cases of emer-
gency. I
‘ The reason for this request is
that the staff‘ of doctors has, in
addition to their "usual duties, the
‘job of caring for the Air Cadets
stationed at the University.
LD1‘. Carlson said, “The students

will be rendering the staff and my—_ »

self a great service by complying
with the request.”

Looking for ‘potential starters",
Coach Mlltterling held  ﬁcrst
intra-squad baseball game in last
Tuesday's practice session. Mit-

terling picked the sides, placing,

the lettermen and last year’s

squad members on one team‘ and
the prospects on the other.

The Regulars (lettermen and
squad members) lost the three and
one-half inning contest 2-0. Bright
spot of the game was the pitching
of both sides. The Regulars gar-
nered only one hit from McClosky
and .“.Red” Reber.

Freshman Women Meet ,
‘At lnter-Unit Get-Together . 

“When I was a freshman, I was green as could be, and my
arm band's color was the same as me.”

With these words the publications unit expressed how
all freshman women felt seven months ago.

Last Wednesday, freshman women had their inter-unit
get-together. Each unit demonstrated how it felt about Pitt
as it was when the Freshman entered, and as it is with its air

cadet student body.

Social Workers’
Shortage Cited

, A shortage of six thousand so-
cial workers has been estimated
and the number far exceeds the
supply which can be made avail-
able by the forty schools of social
work. This fact appeared in the
March issue of “Compass" in an
article entitled “Recruitment for
our Profession of Social Work” by
Ruth Gartland, professor of so-
cial case work in the School of
Applied Social Science.

In this article‘ Miss Gartland re-
ports the activities of the local
chapters of the American Associa-
tion of Social Workers in inter-
preting the demand for trained
personnel to ﬁll positions in social
agencies serving the men , in the
armed forces and civlians in com-
munities affected by the war.

Miss Gartland is now serving as

chairman of the National advisory‘

committee on recruitment, Ameri-
can Association of Social Workers.
Miss Gartland is also first vice-
president of the organization.

IN THE

 

FORCES
they say:

“man HORSES "

for tanks

"GEAR HAPPY "

for shifting gears too often

"THIN SKINS"

for unarmored trucks

"CAMEL"

for the service man’s favorite
cigarette

FIRST IN TWE SERVME

With men in the Army, the Navy,
the Marine Corps, and the Coast
Guard, the favorite cigarette is
Camel. (Based on actual sales records
in Post Exchanges and Canteens.)

 

_For clever lines and an inter-
unit theme, the Acting Unit won
first prize——a handful of lollipops.
Second prize (a chicken bone) went
to the speech unit, third prize (a
lemon), to the Sports Unit, and a
well dried prune for fourth prize
was taken by the Publications Unit.

“As freshman girls it gave us
our start, and to leave it now would
surely break our hearts.”

That is how the Publication unit
described the unit system.

From many units, acting, sports,
camera arts, stagecraft, home arts,
and all the rest, came the same idea.
“We have accomplished a little in
our particular line of work, and a
lot from our varied social programs.
We have met many people through
our junior advisors, and have come
to regard them as oursfriends.”

Units were a part of growing up
at Pitt for the Freshmen, and now
it is time for them to take their
place in Pitt activities.

---where cigarettes are iudged

The "T-ZONE"-Taste and Throat—is the proving ground for
cigarettes. Only your taste and throat can decide which ciga-
rette tastes best to you...and how it affects your throat. For your
taste and throat are ‘absolutely individual to you. Based on the
experienceof millions of smokers, we believe Camels will suit
your "I-ZONE" to a "T." Prove it for yourself!
