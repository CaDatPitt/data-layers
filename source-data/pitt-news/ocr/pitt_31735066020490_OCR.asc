Former Jamaican Prime Minister

Michael Manley condemned the

invasion of Grenada and criticized

other American policies in the

Caribbean Basin and Latin America
last Thursday at the Frick'Fine Arts
Auditorium. Manley, who‘ was
prime minister from 1969 until 1980,

presented a lecture entitled, “U.S. "

and the Caribbean in the ’80s”"to a
near-capacity crowd. G
Manley had much to say about
the American invasion of Grenada,
none of it approving. Of. the U.S.

The Pitt News formally endorses democratic

propaganda in regard to Grenada,
he remarked, “lt blows the mind.”
Maurice Bishop, AGrenada’s , last
leader before the invasion, was sin-
cere about helping Grenada, Manley
said. When he ‘took power after
overthrowing Sir Eric Garry in I975,
France, Great ‘Britain, Canada and
Sweden all responded immediately
witheaid. The U.S. deliberated. The
Cubans also responded, although

. Manleysaid that the invitation to

help Grenada was extended to the
U.S. and Cuba simultaneously.
Manley said of the Bishop admin-
istration, “It is very clear that they
had an impressive record of improv-
ing literacy, their education system
and housing.” Furthermore, ‘‘In

1983, the World Bank wrote a report
that said the Grenadian economy
was the best in'the Caribbean,” he
said.

“The airport in Grenada now
becomes a dramatic symbol of
what's going on in Grenada,“ Man-
ley said of the period before the inva-

_ sion, but President Reagan had "said

that the “ ‘airport was pointed like a
dagger at the U.S.’ ” Manley cited
reports from engineers who built the
airport that it could not, in any
sense, he used for military purposes.
He said that Grenada has a great
potential for tourism and that an
expanded airport was necessary for

wide-bodied jets, and added that

“Embarrasing" and “disgraceful"
were two words the Reverend Jesse
Jackson used to describe" the
Reagan-Bush administration in a
speech he gave to hundreds of Pitts-
burghers who packed Market
Square last Friday.

Jackson has been speaking
throughout the United States in sup-
port of the Mondale-Ferraro ticket.
He said in -Market Square, “We need
a change!” Although his speech was
meant to promote Mondale"s candi-
dacy, it sounded muchlike one of his
own campaign speeches. He stressed
the needs of the poor and of minori-
ties, and the importance of improv-
ing human rights both at home and’
abroad. Jackson also named some
of the Reagan administration’s for-

eign policy failures, primarily con-

cerning the Soviets and the arms
race, and the importance of voting.

Jackson lashed out at Reagan’s
apparent lack of concern for the
poor. “The poor," he said, “must be
supported and protected; they made

this country strong.” Jackson con-‘
demned Reagan for his strong sup- -

port of big business. “Corpora-

tions," he said, “have become-more

powerful under the Reagan adminis-' " 

btra_t_i_o_n_, while workers have been

taking concessions or getting laid"

off."

C Jackson also charged Reagan-I

with being completely ineffective in

his dealings with the Soviet U_nion,.i.
. thus creating a very tense and dan-

atmosphere. “Lwant a
that talks with the

gerous
government

Soviet Union, not at them,”-he said;-F‘ 9 ii

In regard to election itself, he‘
urged everyone to participate.

actively, not only in the presidential * ' J’
election but in all elections from the .-

senate race to local school board

elections: “There are thousands of '5 ‘

reasons to vote," he said,‘ “and no

reason DOI 10. [.698 Vote With 8 

passion!"

Jackson went on to attack the
many polls that’ have predicted ‘a
strong Reagan victory on Tuesday.
.“What’s this I keep hearing about
polls?” he asked. “There's only one
poll, —that‘s your poll on Tuesday
morning. No one‘s behind, the score:
is zero to zero._” _ s

In conclusion, Jackson led aseries

, of chants promoting unity and peace :
in America, and said as he was pre- V ‘

paring to leave, “When I look across

this crowd I’ see ‘the Rainbow

Coalition."

By Bryan Lee
The Pitt News

The sound of gospel music
filled the air as people congre-
gated'in the chill autumn wind to
see and hear the Reverend Jesse
Jackson this Friday in Market
Square. Jackson joyfully hailed
an enthusiastic crowd as
members of his Rainbow,Coali-
ti_on. They in return hailed him
for showing true the American
dream — that any man may truly -‘
aspire to be the president of the 8
United States. .

.“He and Ferrarro have forever
changed the , olitical geo-
graphy,” said State Representa-
tive K. Leroy lrvis on hisway to
Market Square, “neither party
can only consider, White Anglo-
Saxon Protestant male candi-
dates any more." ‘‘I’m delighted
he’s here,” said lrvis.

“This country's still a little bit
too prejudiced to have a black
president," said Thomas
Worthy, who had gathered with
his wife and young daughter to

red Mooreﬁeld was standing
on a trash can in order to gain an
unobstructed view of Jackson.
“Jesse Jackson is the walking »
voice of Moral America," said
Moorefield. “He gives accentto
the spiritual to overwhelm the
materialists with atom bombs in
each hand.” ,
_ Constance Jones of East‘ Lib-
erty cited Jackson’s presidential
attempt as “  something to be
very proud of." When asked if
she would now support Mondale
she said, “Whatever direction
is the right
direction." ‘

Robert Emmett Kennedy, 82,
said that when he first voted in
1918, he had to pay a poll tax of
one dollar. This year he voted for
Jackson in the democratic
primary. '

Reporter says that    
todays students are selfish

I By Jennifer Benzing

The Pitt News

Peter Lance, one of TV’s top
investigative reporters, spoke to a
group of Duquesne students Tues-
day night. Lance has worked on
ABC's 20/20, News Magazine and
Nightly News shows where he
exposed such operations as mal-
practice in mental hospitals, unnec-
essary surgery and abortion bills.

Lance gave the group of predomi-
nantly communication and journal-
ism majors advice on their careers.
“Don't major in journalism  take
courses you'll never be able to study
in your life again. Study history,
economics. Learn a foreign lan-
guage.” Many of the students
appeared upset by his advice, and
one woman — a senior in journal-
ism, asked howit looked forjournal-
ism majors in the job market. To this
Lance replied, “Most people in col-
lege today couldn't give two shits
about their fellow man.” He said he

had traveled to many colleges where
he talked to students- “They only
care about themselves and how to
get a job. That’s contemptible."

Lance spoke ofthe luxury of time
when doing investigative reporting.
“Most of reality is below the surface,
 what's going on that really affects

you  ” He said other types of '
reporting only provided the
obvious, which is necessary, but is
never the whole story. “There is no
other country in the world where
investigative reporting can operate
[but] how often does the govern-
ment lie to us?"

One student asked if Lance
thought the political elites were ulti-
mately in control. “People in power
usually win,” said Lance. “The
government almost always wins
because they are in control of dis-
seminated information.”

After showing some clippings
from _stories that had appeared on
network television, Lance described
some of the experiences he had while
investigating. ‘‘I had to learn how to
think like a criminal. The white-
collar criminals are especially ingen-

ious.” For one case, Lance moved
into a Bronx apartment for four
months to watch the operations ofa
company involved with toxic waste
disposal. He discovered that one of
the company’s tactics was-to mix the
toxins with fuel oil, which was then
sold for pure fuel oil and used in
heating apartment buildings in New,
York City. The waste was filling the
environment, leading to monstrous
and irreversible health damage.

Lance spoke of another investiga-
tion in which he formed a fake com-
pany and became involved with
people in an arson ring. “I was actu-
ally there,” said Lance, “when these
people set fire to buildings in which
seven people died."

Lance invited the students to join

him at I-Ioulihan's restaurant after .

the lecture to talk further, and ended
with more advice. “There's-no spe-
cific formula or road to success. It
doesn’t matter where you go to
school. You're only as good as your
last story,“ said Lance. “The most
important quality is stubbornness.
You have to be able to follow your
gut feeling.”

Republican H.Q. harassed .

By Bryan Lee
The Pitt News

Pittsburgh’s Republican Party
Headquarters has been the target of
harrassment by overzealous
Mondale-Ferraro supporters,
according to Joyce Lewis, office
coordinator of the Smithfield St.
headquarters. “We had to have the
police in yesterday,” said Lewis,
“because someone was violent."

Even as Lewis spoke, a staff
worker was busy scraping off
Mondale-Ferraro bumper stickers‘
that had been plastered across the
front door. The stickers obscured a

poster depicting a smiling President
Reagan. But that was just the latest
in a series of assaults on the presi-
dent’s likeness.

“There's always spit dripping
from the president's face,” lamented
Lewis. ~ '

Lewis said the harrassment began
the first day the_ office opened.
Someone tore down their‘, banner
draped across the outside. Since
then, they have had to contend with
spit on the windows, objects hurled
from’ passing vehicles and threaten-
ing telephone calls.

Lewis said on one... day she had
answered the phone 15 times only to
hear another phone ringing and it

being answered _by a Democratic.
volunteer saying, “Mondale-

Ferraro; we’re going to win." Lewis

’ felt that this was done purposefully _

by someone on a phone with
conference-call capacity, whereas
the volunteer answering the phone
that day at Mondale-Ferraro head-
quarters attributed it to faulty phone
lines. She said the Democratic head-
quarters had trouble with their

, phones the same day with “clicking

noises.”

Lewis said the problems are par-

ticularly bad when there is a demo-'

cratic rally downtown. She said they
feel a little like an outpost in hostile
territory.

Tomorrow is Election Day. By Wednesday. morning, we
shall know whether we will have a Republican president
(maybe Mr. Reagan, maybe not) and continue to follow the
lines of policy that we as a nation presently follow, or a Demo-
cratic president who promises to make deep and wide policy
changes. Granting this, there is only one way to make a sensible
choice: to know what all those policies are and to know the
logical outcomes of maintaining or altering them.

Ronald Reagan, because of his oft-stated belief that the
Soviet Union is an evil empire, has increased military spending.
This increase in spending has produced only a small number of
defensive weapons, several first-strike nuclear_weapons, the
still homeless MX missile, a B-l bomber that does not work, a
jet fighter that does not work, two fleets of tanks that do not
work and more filling Pentagon lunches. Walter Mondale
wishes to end the above-stated waste and build more defensive
weapons. ' i

The president has effectively reduced the budgets of social
programs. His secretary of agriculture stated that a family of
four can subsist on $54 of food per week. The president himself
-stated ‘that there is no hunger in America and that only those
who are too lazy to work go to soup kitchens for daily suste-
nance. Several well-respected critics of the Reagan administra-
tion have expressed fear that the president’s- line of logic will

lead to the complete elimination of Social Security and much, if _
not all, of federal aid to students. Mondale wishes to insure the.

security of existing social programs under lean administration.
1 _In short, it seems apparent that Reagan wishes to increase
overall federal spending (invariably an inﬂationary co_urse to
follow), driving up the national debt and therefore damaging
. the United States’ prestige and position ofstrength in the world
while simultaneously increasing domestic hardship. Mondale’s
record and statements explicitly suggest that he can strengthen

A_rnerica’s position among the nations of the world by strength- i 2.

ening America from the inside, and‘ noit quivering with fear
outside. 7

The Pitt News, therefore, endorses the Mondale-Ferraro
ticket. -

.Great

White Hoax

Ronald Reagan is on
the road to giving a frightening
amount of power to the highest lev-
els of government. A “landslide vic-
tory” by a Republican president
would: .

1) give us a Republican executive
branch (the president) ‘

2) allow for a Republican-
'appointed judicial branch (the

Supreme Court  three to five more
appointees) - -
. 3) carry a ﬂow" of Republicans

into the legislative branch (__Senate .

and, Congress) A

Big government, indeed: And this
from a president who came into
power when “America was down,"

claiming that the bad economy was_
' to ‘blame on the Carter administra-

tion, wherr in fact the state of our

 economy can clearly be blamed on

the oil crisis prior to and during Car-
ter‘s administration-. The price of oil
in "1979 jumped incredibly, and the

- economy in the U.S. and around the

world could not absorb the OPEC-
imposed price increases. Industry
suffered terribly. People lost jobs.

Now, in the midst of a world-wide
oil glut, inflation is down, jobs are
on the rise (good jobs for a select

7 few, not-so-good jobs for most, and

no jobs at all for many), and Reagan
is taking the credit. g
Ronald" Reagan .. _ the Great

“the Great White Hoax”: Reagan is
_“the Great Communicator." Abso-
lutely, He as communicated his
myth to 'a great number of people.
Many innocent people may vote for
him because they believe that he can
provide jobs and that he won't tax
them unfairly. r
Many not-so-innocent people will
vote for him because they know that
he will provide their sector with the
fruits of a good economy. The
middle-upper (mostly upper) class
white American will have a good job
and will not be taxed to as great an

-extent under the Republican

administration.

Daily Ivhear those who have a
slight interest in this election say:

i) “I'm not voting.". .

2) “I'm not voting because Reagan
will win anyway.”

3) “I'm not voting for Reagan
because I want a job.“ .

And I hear those who have a
strong interest in this election say: “I

4) Mondale is a much better

' alternative.”

' What surprises me is the selfish-
ness of those who see clearly that
they will live nicely while many mil-
lions of people are driven to their
knees (literally) in poverty.

Voters, American people, please
think seriously about what is about
to happen to our government! You
can either act now by simply pulling
a lever to cast your vote (after care-
ful consideration), or you can spend

the rest of this century trying to

regain your self-respect. You and I
are responsible for our fellow man,
for our environment and for our
own relationship with our own God.

3 Your condescending editorial of
Oct. 8, in which you pompously
declared, ‘f... voters do notknow
what they -should about the issues
involved here,” was Ta distasteful
irony, coming from a paper that-has
scarcely demonstrated, a grasp of the
issues in this ‘election. /Instead of giv-
i_ng reasons for your support of ‘
Mondale and unabashed opposition
to Reagan, you have consistently
relied on Mondale’s_ own cheap slo-
gans to support your positions,
asserting, for instance, that ‘Reagan
wants to mobilize this country for
war. '

In an editorial of Oct. 3, you sup-
port your claim that the Reagan
administration is full of crooks by
citing an accusation against his '
labor secretary, scarcely reminding
your readers that anyone can make
an accustaion against a popular
president. An (accusation is not,-
however, proof of guilt.

Your paper rightly points out that-
“... Mondale is not unaware of rhe-
torical techniques used to attract
voters." Perhaps his problem is that
voters are smarter than he thinks (at
least judging by thepolls). Mond_ale
promises everything to everyone,
but the. taxes he would need to
deliver , the half of his promises
would choke the ' American
economy. '

- He promises to put the steel mills
back to work, for instance. To
accomplish this,‘ he would levy
heavy tariffs on imports or set
import quotas. This approach, while
perhaps providing a temporary calm
in the storm against “smokestack"
industries, would have far-reaching
and crippling repercussions
throughout the entire import-export ,

’ industry, against which the ‘present,-,
.problem, T ,<_>f_.’Aan ‘-over-valued_ ;dollar"

On foreign policy, "Mondale
doesn’t act; he reacts. When our
Marines first went to Lebanon to
disengage the.‘PLO and Israelis,
Mondale voiced no opposition
(among the Democrats, only Gary

_Hard did). As soon as the first"

Marineiwas shot by a sniper, he did
the politically predictable thing to
do. He_ vociferously called for their
withdrawal. Either he was playing
irresponsible political games with a
sensitive area in foreign policy, or he
is not a strong enough leader to

make a hard decision without turn- ,

ing his, tail at the first sign of
difficulty.

On Sept. 17, William Pierce aptly
described Mondale and his party in
a letter to your paper: “The Demo-
cratic Party under Walter Mondale

has turned away from its past of pro-.. _

gressive thinking and positiveflead-
ershipp to one of a party - of
apologists. The domesticpolicies he
proposes are outdatedand ineffec-
tive. ln foreign policy, he apologizes
and blames the U.S. for problems
everywhere.” Mondale said in the
debatesithat he would not delegate
— the _same mistake made by Carter
in the ill-fated rescue of the Ameri-
can hostages in Iran.

Mondale claims Reagan is soft on
human rights abroad. In fact, Rea-
gan has put much quiet pressure to
bear on our right"-wing allies to
improve human rights (El Salvador
and Marcos of the Philippines, for

example). Mondale, would apply

pressure in the public arena, embar-

. rassing our allies, losing our friends.
On Central America, the plan Mon- _

dale proposes describes in a nutshell
Reagan's policies there. Despite
images, there.is little. difference. , _

Mondale said in a recent interview
that Carter did not pressure Israel
enough to, make concessions to the

' PLO -terrorists. Reagan doesn’t pre-

tend to befriend the enemies of
democracy and is working to help
-Israel’s troubled economy.
Mondale scares the elderly with
unfounded claims about -Social
Security payment cuts by Reagan.’
Reagan’ has saved Social Security

‘ from bankruptcy and has guaran-

teed support for it. ~  ' ,
Mondale criticizes Reagan for no
arms agreement with the Soviets,
failing to recognize that it takes two
to tango. Reagan is the best chance
we’ve ever had for actual reduction
in the number of nuclear warheads,
and the Soviets take him seriously-
On other issues as well, Reagan
shows common sense leadership and
Mondale - displays incompetence.
Faced with Mondale’s ‘dismal lead-

. ership, Reagan is the wisest choice in

the upcoming election.

It’s Getting Deep In Here/ by Nadia Moritz

Students Across Country ,Exhibit New Brand 0 of Activism

Today, a new kind of student ac-
tivism has emerged at colleges
around the country, an .activism
with little resemblance to the pro-
tests and marches of the l9,60s when
the Vietnam War and civil rights
issues united students in a set of
common causes. The college stu-
dents of the 1980s are more prag-
matic and career minded with
concerns that tend to be more per-
sonal than those of the 60s. _

At a conference last summer, the
U.S. Student Association deter-
mined tuition costs and ﬁnancial aid
as top priorities on the college
agenda above national issues such as
nuclear disarmament or American
involvement in Grenada. Even at
active campuses like the University
of Chicago and Columbia Univer-

sity, students are more at ease with’

the establishment and are just as

likely to promote, conservative‘

causes as liberal ones. At Columbia
University, for instance, a recent
demonstration against U.»S. involve-
ment in Grenada attracted fewer
than 100 students. .

In a recent poll conducted by the
American Council on‘ Education,-
only.2l percent of today’s -college

-students, as opposed to 52 percent a

decade ago, considered themselves
liberal. Some analysts attribute this
trend to apathy. Irene Conely, Uni-
versity of Chicago director of stu-
dent activities, disagrees. “They
have the same questioning brains

‘and the same commitment,” said

Conely. “They just have a different’
way of expressing it. Today’s stu-
dent is more pragmatic.”

Instead of the sit-ins and demon-
strations of the ’60s, student political
tactics have shifted to lobbying

‘ efforts and campus letter-writing
campaigns. Last year, 1,000 students '
from New York University traveled’

to Albany, N.Y., to lobby against
state aid cuts and similar situations.

. “I have trouble relating to the peo-
ple of the ’60s,” said University of
Chicago student Jonathan Kandell,
who is the president of the Students
for Peace and Disarmament .organi-
zationthere. “Our rallies are differ-

. 4 ent. I think wejre working within the

system more."

The dogmatism of the ’60s has
been transformed into the pragma-
tism of the ’80s and has carried over
into student voting patterns as well.

‘While in the 1960s the attitude of _

many young Americans was “Don't
trust anyone over 30,” today's youth
seem to be putting their faith in a
president over 70. According to
recent CBS/ New ‘York Times polls,
voters between the ages of I8 and 24
support Reagan by 61 percent to the
39 percent that support Mondale.
In l968,_.only ll percent of 18 to
25-year-olds considered themselves
Republicans. Today, this percentage
has grown to 25. And in a poll con-

‘ ducted by Pitt's political science

department last spring, 66 percent of
the students surveyed‘ favored
Reagan. ' .

“The Republicans represent an
old-fashioned, patriotic image,”said

Pitt freshman Zach Timko,'who is a.

member of the Allegheny County

Republican Club and a Republican

‘campaign worker. “I think college

kids are looking for something like
that something stable and
strong." ‘

Although many youthful Reagan
supporters deny making a long-term.
commitment to the Republican
party, their support for Reagan as a
candidate remains strong. Many
analysts argue that this popularity is,
based on Reagan's personal traits.
He is coming across as a firm father
figure who inspires conﬁdence and
patriotism.

“He’s personable,” said Timko.
“Mondale is so dry and lifeless, but
Reagan has that charisma. He’s fun-
loving and confident, and he makes
a good first K impression. First
impressions are important.”

Vange D'Aquila, a junior at Pitt, «
considers Reagan’s image-an impor- ,

tant campaign tactic. “He always

takes a stand, and he’s firm and con- .

ﬁdent,”.said D‘Aquila. “Even if he’s
not right, you think he’s right and
that’s.what is important.”

Pitt senior Greg Dyakon agreed.
“I think that Reagan is everything
that America stands for  confi-
dence, strength and, red-blooded
patriotism.” ‘ ' . .

The resurgence of patriotism is
another element that analysts iender
asprominent among the young, and
it'is visible in the rising military
enlistments. The enrollment of the
Reserve Officer Training Corps has
doubled.fro_m a decade ago _and has
risen 29 percent in the last year. Even
student demonstrations, have taken
on ‘a conservative tone. Florida
State University held a pro-Reagan

«rally after the Grenada invasion last

year. The University of Georgia
recently held a rally to increase the
awareness of the Communist threat

in Central America, and at the Uni-.

versity of'- Houston, students pro-
tested a local public television series
about Vietnam, claiming it to be
pro-communist; _
Reagan’s charismatic and patriot-
ic appeal is especially important in‘

iinﬂuencing voters with limited polit-
, ical experience.

“If you’re 25 and under, you fully
visualize only two American presi-

dents: Ronald Reagan and Jimmy .
Carter,” said Ann F. Lewis, political '_ I

director of the Democratic National
Committee. “The fact is, they are
told every day by the media that
Ronald Reagan is a success and
Jimmy Carter was not.”

Kristen Sossman. a senior at the
University of Pittsburgh, is voting
Republican. for this reason: “When
Carter was president, there was no

’ patriotism  no_ pride in the coun-

try," said Sossman. “Reagan's
instilled that. I think that if Mondale
gets into office, itfs going to be the
Carter ' adminis-tration all over
again.” I

For many young voters, all that _

they know about Walter Mondale is
his ties as vice president to Carter’s
“unsuccessful" term as president.
They are not aware of Mondale’s
record in the Senate or of his sup.-
port for many of the civil rights and

‘ social programs that the youth of

today seem to take for granted.
Republican strategists ‘agree that

     
  

  

 
   
  

another force behind the youthful
support of Reagan is economic self-
interest. “Economics is central to
their whole agenda,” said Reagan
campaign official Lee Atwater,
“which is based on success."

A recent survey by UCLA psy-

"cholo_gist Alexander Astin of

250,000 incoming freshmen across
the nation, reaffirmed this economic
self-interest. While in 1970, 39 per-“
cent of the freshmen determined '
“financial well-being” as an impor-
tant goal, in 1983 the percentage
rose to 69. Ti-mko attributes this rise
to “a more realistic outlook.“
“We’ve seen it happen in the ‘
l960s, and we’ve learned,” said
Timko. “I look at those hippie peo-
ple and I think that they were stupid.
I’m in college now, and,I want to do
well so that I can get a good job."
Although many of Reagan's eco-
nomic policies haveresulted in fewer
student funds-, many students con-

‘tinue to support his economic

policies.

“I’ve lost student aid because of
Reagan’s economic policies," said
Timko. “But you have to sacrifice
somewhere. You have to compr'o-"._
mise. We will be better off in the
future." ’

V Pitt graduate Peg Moulton
agrees. “Reagan cut a lot of welfare
programs, but I think that is neces-

sary,” said Moulton. ‘‘I don‘t like

”paying.for people who can‘t support

themselves."

The conservative trend in young
voters has left Democrats stunned
and confused, but - most political
analysts agree that both the imme-
diate impact and the long-term
effect of this age gap are uncertain.

' Currently only about. 25 percent of

college students are registered to
vote, and according to the I980 Gal-
lup Election poll, 47 percent of the
voters between the ages of I8 and 25
favored the Carter-Mondale ticket.

Young women are the strongest
dissenters from Reagan, favoring
him by 53 to 38 percent in the latest

-CBS/ New York Times polls, where
—.men favored him 69 to 2l percent

Studies show that women are less
likely to accept the use of force and
are more sympathetic toward the
poor and disadvantaged. Both are
interests that clash with many of
Reagan’s policies and explain these
poll differences. Anne Rocco, a stu-
dent coordinator for the Democratic
party at Pitt, is one of the dissenting
women. ' g _ .

“I think Reagan is a stuffed shirt.
He is an actor," said Rocco. “Mon-
dale may not be as polished, but he is
real and honest, and he is for all of
the people instead of only the rich.
Heis going to help the little man 

and thats who is hurting the most.”

Pitt junior Angharad Grimes is

also voting Democratic-. “I'm afraid

that Reagan is going to get us into a

"nuclear war, and I can’t believethat I

ﬂ’l0l'€ students are I10! C0nCCl'l'|Cd

about it," said Grimes. “Everyone is I

so wrapped up in their economic
self-interest what about their
lives?" . - ' _

Dotty Lynch, a Democratic-poll

taker, has noticed -a difference‘

between the parties on issues like the
proposed Equal Rights Amendment
and the use of government to ﬁght
discrimination  issues that concern
many young women. - ‘

“I can‘t understand how so many
women can vote for a presidential
candidate who thinks that equal
rights is fine as long as its not an
amendment," said Rocco. “I’m cer-
tainly not voting for a candidate
who promotes an inferior position
of women.” ’ A

Reagan does have his critics

among the young, butfor this elec-' ‘
tion, most young voters seem to be -

following their conservative tenden-
cies and voting for the president who

has, in Lewis‘ words, given them"

“something to root for."-

As Timko said, “The young peo-
ple have had a taste of one side and
now they are trying something new.
We're more realistic. Now we want
stability and trust—and a good eco-
nomic future."

The Pitt News

Tomorrow, millions of Americans will travel to their local polls to make -

‘decisions that will shape the outlook of national politics for another presi-

dential term. Aside from the third party candidates, the choice is between’

Republicans Ronald Reagan and George Bush and Democrats Walter Mon-
, dale and Geraldine Ferraro.

In September, I asked Pitt students who they think will win and who they
support. Today, the campaigns have given their all to sway voters to their
side. But how did the campaigns affect the initial views of students on
campus’? In this, the last political poll before the election, I will focus on:

1) The effect of the 3 national debates.
2) Opinions of the candidates.

3) Who will win tomorrow.

4) Who Pitt students support.

First off, the national polls reflect conflicting views on “who won” the 3
great debates. In‘ early October, Reaganand Mondale met in a debate on
domestic affairs. Four days later Bush and Ferraro met in the “Running
mate debate.” And finally, the foreign policy debate ended up the season.
Many of the students on campus gathered together in front of TVs to hear.
what the candidates had to say. So by asking. simply who they think won the

debates, I collectedthlegfollowing data: ,

-Overall 51 _ 45, ‘ 4

Overall, the debates were close. In fact, almost everyone agreed that the
debates fai_le‘d to sway that many. But the debates» did bring out some
questions that made both sides think about their choices. So I asked students
about who they thought won in respect to the qualities of leadership,
physical health” (age), experience, knowledge of issues and overall qualities to
be ‘president. Here is what they said:

Reagan VS- Mondale-’ Bush vs. Ferraro

As in the debates, the incumbentsredged out their opponents on the overall
scale. Note the low ratings of F e_1_'raro vs. Bush. ‘In accordance with the earlier
poll, many" students feel that Ferraro is notpresidential material. '

So far I have.focused?on therecent inﬂuen'_ceof the campaigns. Now, we
return to the orig1nal'questions_ -that have been asked many times in the last
several months. I) .Who will win? 2) 'Who do you support? As in September, I
gave students on campus the opportunity to voice their opinions and I have

compared the late. October results with the -initial results. Here is what I "‘

The’ grand outcome of the political campaigns shows thatthere were no
major changes in the opinions of the supporters on either side, but the
majority of the undecided have ﬁnally made up their mind. The Reagan lead

“Lights: camera: action!” Ever
have the urge to shout about words?
Does Ingmar Bergman's style inter-
est you? Are you a foreign film

-fanatic? The Film Studies program,
which is currently being offered
through the College of Arts and
Sciences, now gives students an '
opportunity to explore these and
other aspects of the film world.

The Film" Studies major, under"
the direction of Dr. Lucy Fischer, is

the field since the early l970’s, and a
certificate or a minor in film was
approved in 1979. Yet students who
were interested in furtherino them-

The

selves had to go through the process
of a self-designed major until the
..film major was approved in May of
this year. '
i “The purpose of the film studies
courses is not primarily vocational,
' but to see the history and theory of
films as an art form,” explained Dr.
_Fischer. The program centers not
only on the technical aspects of the
actual process of film-making, but
also seeks to educate students in
studies of American and foreign
films focusing on the history, aes-

thetics, theory and production of ‘

cinema, so as to give a good back-
ground in the area. Students get
“hands-on" experience in the film-
making process through the course
offered at the Pittsburgh Film
Makers.

Beginning with the winter term,
students will no longer have to take
production courses under the catch-
all course CAS 110 (Film-making).
Instead, individual film-making

iPitt‘iNews, Monday, November 5, I984 '

now being offered

courses will be listed under a film
studies designation. The $125 tui-
tion fee is still in effect.

Those who graduate from the pro-
gram, depending upon their inter-
ests, can go on to pursue careers in
such areas as film journalism, film
museum curatorial work, film teach-
ing, as well as film and television
production. Marylynn Uricchio, a
graduate of Pitt in the self-designed
B.A. in filmstudies, is currently
working as a staff writer and film
critic for the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette. Other graduates from the
previously self-designed major work
in such fields as screenwriting, film
editing and producing for such com-
panies as Warner Cable.

Fischer has been with the univer-
sity since 1979? She accepted her
position here after receiving her
Ph.D. in cinemastudies from New
York University. Before coming to
Pitt, she was employed in the film
department of -two museums,.one

being th auseum of Modern Art in
New York. She was the first director
of the program given release time;
that is, the opportunity to teach,
organize and administer the pro-

gram. Through her work in this

position, she hopes to give the stu-
dents a well-rounded education in
film so that they will “understand
and appreciate the medium, and be
aware of its cultural impact.”

The film studies program has now
begun to take its place in the human-
ities curriculum. Courses in the film
program have been integrated into
the new core curriculum, including a
number of visual arts and writing
(W) courses. Local film organiza-
tion such as the Section of Film and
Video, in the Museum of Art of Car-
negie Institute, are involved with the
film program in co-sponsoring a
great deal, of events such as speakers

(UPI) — Sparse crowds of Indi-
ans lined the streets of New Delhi
Saturday to bid farewell to Indira
Gandhi, the woman who ‘dominated
their politics since I966. _

The crowds were far below the

two million that government offi-
, cials had expected. Mourners appar-

ently stayed away for fear India’s
mob violence might break out along
the parade route. ' ’
The body of the slain prime minis-
ter was put on a gun carriage Satur-
day outside the house where she_
grew up. It began a .slow journey to
the cremation site — the bank of the

holy Yamuna River, seven miles ‘

away.
Helicopters ﬂew overhead’ to
watch for possible trouble. New vio-
lence was reported, but it was in
South Delhi, several miles away
from the funeral cortege.
Since Gandhi’s assassination

a Wednesday, an estimated 800 peo— i
ple have died across India in ﬁghting

between Hindus and Sikhs. Two
_Sikhs.are blamed for her assassina-
tion. Five hundred of the deaths
were in New Delhi, the capital. '
Officials said scores of passengers

. were found dead with knife wounds

on trains arriving in New ‘Delhi.
Most of them were Sikhs. "The
government has stopped train ser-
vice to the city from the Sikh areas.

Gandhi was the daughter of
Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first

. prime minister. But her style, when _

she became prime minister in 1966,
was different from her father‘s slow
and compromising politics. She
purged her Congress Party of those
who disagreed with her. i
‘In March -' 1971, she won re-
election from an electorate wanting
strong leadership as war with Pakis-
tan approached. But in a I977 elec-

“xeion, the voters turned her out; she

became a political outcast and was

_ threatened with jail for her alleged

excesses during emergency rule dur-_
ing her administration. In‘ I980, she
was voted into office "again. -

“Knowing him, I see a lot of the
same qualities.” Jones said that
Jackson's presidential attempt.
was a good idea, even though “he
knew he wasn’t going to win.” He
said it was a symbolic’ effort to
get a larger percentage of the
people to look at the presidency
more seriously. “Maybe thereis a

this role as the number one per-
son in America,” said Jones.

‘ (UPI) —’Authorities said an inter-
national narcotic network was
broken Friday with the arrest of 37
suspects, including the reputed king-
pin and his family.

An assistant U.S. attorney said 23
people were arrested in New-Jersey,
nine in New York, one in Miami and
four in the Montreal area. Four fugi-
tives are still being sought.

The defendants are charged with

conspiring to sell pure ‘heroinand

Nepal and Columbia.

Drug agents confiscated nearly
$500,000 in cash, 10 pounds of high
quality heroin with a street value of
$20 million and an arsenal of

The FBI investigation began in

(Philadelphia UPI) —— The city of
Philadelphia asked the ’ state
Supreme Court to determine the
constitutionality of a lower court's.
1972 ruling requiring that inmates in
Philadelphia prisons‘ have individ-
ual cells.

In a petition, the city's attorneys
also asked the high court to assume‘
complete jurisdiction of the 13-year-
old case that led to the lower court’s
ruling and subsequent court orders
to reduce overcrowding in the city’s
three prisons. _

Mayor. Wilson Goode said only
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
can resolve the standard for housing

prisoners, and that this is necessary

if the city is to end the problem of
prison overcrowding.

At Stake is the city’s plan to reduce
overcrowding by building a 650-cell
facility in northeast Philadelphia,
which. is scheduled for completion
nex-t year, and a downtown holding

_ facility and criminal courthouse.

The Pitt Women's basketball
team held a Blue-Gold intrasquad
scrimmage at Fitzgerald Field

are in preparation for their season
opener on Nov. 24 against St.
Vincent.“ _ _
Going into the scrimmage, coach
Judy Saurer was looking for the
eight or 10 players that work
together-the best. Shecommented,
“Up until this point, everyone on the
team has seen first team action, with
the exception. of Sally Sheerer, who
has been out with an injury.” At the
workout’s end, it was still tough to

., say who would play and would not.

*’ The scrimmage was characterized
by tenacious-defense and up-beat
offense. Both squads played aggres-
sively and it was a rarity to get a shot
off uncontested. The exceptions to
the rule were fast breaks and back
door layups that were a result of
good defense and sharp passes.

As expected, early in the season,
both squads made their share of mis-
takes. These mistakes were types
that can be eliminated as the season
progresses. As a team gains expe-

A‘ rience, the turnovers, missed foul

disappear.

A’ long year of waiting will
come to an end for Pitt women’s
swimming head coach Dave
Belowich this Thursday when the
Lady Panthers travel to Kent
State for the first dual meet of the
season. Belowich is expecting big
things out of his defending Big
East Champions. Belowich com-
mented, “We have * excellent

depth and an excellent front line.
It may sound cocky, but I don’t. '
see how anybody can beat us in
the conference."

With all but two swimmers
returning from last year’s squad,
Belowich plans to savor this sea-
son. “This year is going to be fun.
This team is extremely close, and
they understand the team con-
cept. Now, instead of having to
build a team, we can just con-
tinue our progress.”

One‘ way of progressing is by
bringing in talented freshmen.

Ranck raises swimmer s’ hopes

One such person is butterﬂy spe-
cialist Michelle Ranck, who is a
graduate of Reading _High
School in central Pennsylvania
and has been swimming since she
was nine years old. Despite more
than nine years of swimming
experience under her belt, this
year has taught her a great deal.
She credits Belowich-with help-
ing her to improve.

“Coach Belowich has pointed
out the flaws in my stroke. As a
result, I have been able to adjust
and correct my stroke. My times

‘ third . consecutive Big East

1*’
are a lot better than last year in
high school."

Ranck and her fellow team-
mates have been working hard in
preparation for this weekend,
which also features a dual meet
at the University of Michigan on
Friday. The Pitt swimmers have
endured two-a-day practices of
late along with their academic
load. This kind of ‘dedication has
paid off in the past; the Lady
Panthers will be pursuing their

championship.

ers will work the kinks out of them-
selves in the next few weeks before
they head... to Chicago for the
Northwestern Tournament. Coach
Saurer admits, “We don’t really
know that much about St. Vincent,
but we will «take a look at them
before we ,play them.” The lady
Panthers face Robert Morris after
the St. Vincent game, then they will

challenge the likes of Utah and Old '

Dominion, the latter a national
championship contender,‘ at the
Northwestern Tournament.

* Although the prospect of getting a

chance to defeat ateam like Old
Dominion is tantalizing, Coach
Saurer promised, “By no means will
we lookpast St. Vincentand Robert
Morris to ‘Old Dominion. Every
game is like the World Series for
Me.” .

Coach Saurer is entering her fifth
year as coach of the Lady Panthers.
Her fourth-year record is 69-45,
including a women's NIT bid in
1981.

Hockey   team” gets

By M Wolf

. The Pitt ews

The Pitt hockey team added
another win to its record yesterday
with a 7-2 victory. over g_IUP at
Lakevue Ice Arena.

The Panthers went into this game
seeking revenge after settling for a
disappointing tie with IUP last Wed-
nesday. “We played this game with
more discipline than Wednesday's
game,” said center Jim Lang.
“Things got away from us on Wed-
nesday but we kept our composure
this time.” Pitt tookapowerful lead
in the first period with three goals
and remained in command for the

rest of the game. “IUP came out

ooyeu thinkit-is possible to JUGGLE

skating hard but they couldn't get
within reach of us," said coach Jim

‘ Owens Sr. Owens attributes the win

to the fact that they were able to
keep putting in new people and keep
the players fresh the whole game.

The Most Valuable Player award
was presented to center Jim Lang,
who scored three goals for the
Panthers, his third hat trick of the

‘season. Lang’s achievements were

described by Coach Owens as being
“very unusual for any hockey player, .
especially so early in the season."

Lang believes that part of the rea-
son behind his success lies in the
efforts of the rest of the team. “There
are a couple of guys who are getting
me the puck. Oldaker on my right
and Murphy on my left are doing a
great job,” said Lang.

revenge  

Goalie John Godwin played a
good game for Pitt with 30 saves for
32 shots. Defenseman Damon
Brown also played aisolid game for
the Panthers. “He never gets caught
out of position,” said teammate Jim

. Lang. “He's always in the right place

at the right time.”

Brown also credited the other
-members of the team. “There were

good overall efforts from every-
body," said Brown. “I’m trying to .

work on my skills. I feel I'm weak in
a couple of areas.”

The Pitt hockey team is off to a
strong start with a record of 3-0-1.
They will be traveling to the Civic
Center in Erie this Friday to take on
their next opponent, Gannon. The
game starts at 8 p.m. and will be

continued from page fourteen
split end Bill Wallace. Disappoint-
ment, because after a year in which
he replaced deep threat J uliusDaw-
kins and racked up 727 yards on 45
receptions, he’s far below the pace

- right now. ' V ‘

The senior from Flemington,
N.J., has 36 this year, but only 490
yards with two games to go.»“ln my’
opinion I don’t think I’m having a‘
bad year,” the ’82 redshirt said.
“Because Johnny [Congemi] has
been hurt all year I don't think that’s
helped me out at all. [Chris] Jelic’s
come in, but he doesn’t have the
experience. It’s a disappointment,
but from an unusual standpoint, I
think I‘m having a good year.”

Indicative of the disappointment A

iﬁwwas the difference in halves in Satur-

If

day’s game. As the Panthers
searched to get 200-yard passing"
games out of Congemi, Jelic, John
Cummings, anybody, only one pass
was caught in the first half against
Syracuse. Tailback Craig “Iron-
head” Heyward got two yards on
that.one. , ' _
Wallace entered the Dome with‘ a’
recep.tion-per-game average_ strug-
gling above four and got only two v«
for .27 yards all day.’ Wallace
shrugged, “I don’t know what to say
about it. We know we. could have
won this game.” 2 .
The Panthers know they can win‘
with Wallace — if they only get the
6-2, 195-lb.'er. the ball. Injuries and .
sour performances by the quarter-
backs have nullified those chances
so far with no end in sight_ this
season. - - . . I '
His only honestly productive day
came against Oklahoma when he
pulled in nine receptions for .135
yards“but hasonly reached as high as
the five plateau since then, when he
got 72 yargds against Eas'tCaroli_na.
“I can‘t see how you_Vsay'that," is
what Wallace will say when the pros-
pects of opposing secondaries turn-
ing the trick on him are brought up;

I “Things just aren’t turning out right.

  

   

The big factor has been themany
times John_’s not been playing. We
worked all year las( year. He knows
me, I know him." ' I

' lt seems that the Panthers play.
not only to get their next ‘win, .but to
keep intact the head coaching title
Faiio was handed two years ago.
“ltfs all part of it,” Bill Fralic said_
when asked if he’s playing'to ensure
Fazio keeps, his job. “I want to win

for that guyas much as anyone else. '
 l, seeswhat-, he -go

V is. through and I‘ .,
wan!t0'wixi‘£or?-him.» -' » . = T

 

 Players saddened

“lt’s natural for him to take the

I blame since he’s in the public. He’s

been excellent through the whole
thing. He believes we’re goingto win
next week and the week after. You
never know how someone is going to
react under something like this. He’s
taken a hell of a lot of this. I'm not
blowing smoke up his ass, because
I’m out of here in two weeks. It's
something I believe in.” '

According to Pitt trainer Eran
Feld, there were no major injuries
against. Syracuse. That’s the second
straight week the Panthers have
come out of games injury—free this
season. ' '

itt loses

to IUP, 1-0;.

By Kirsten Gostony
The Pitt News

Editor’s note: the Pitt soccer team
failed to receive a bid to the Big East
championships that will be held this
weekend. The Panthers lost their
chance to Villanova who received
the last spot for the tournament.

As their last" regularly scheduled
game of the season, Saturday’s
match against Indiana University of

» Pennsylvania ‘was a rather disap-

P pointing .1-O loss for the Panther
soccer team. However, the Panthers
had a respectable showing despite
the fact that they were forced to play
with only 10 players against lUP’s
ll-member lineup for the “final 12
minutes of the game. Not only were
they hoping to finish the regularly
scheduled games with a win, but
they were also hoping to secure a bid
to compete in the Big East Cham-

. pionship this weekend. The loss does
not definitely eliminate Pitt’s chan-
ces, but it does leave it uncertain as
to whether or not they will receive
the bid. " I "'

Peanther defenseman Craig
Freund was expelled from the game
after receiving two yellow flags. His
first came‘ as a result of an exchange
of words ‘with a referee when he dis-
agreed with a call. The second ﬂag,
however, seemed quite disputable.
“I was trying to throw the ball in
from out of bounds, and I thought

‘ that I was in the right place when the
referee called for me to step back
further down the line,” explained
Freund. “But no matter how far
back I stepped, it didn’t seem to
satisfy him. That’s when he decided

' to throw the flag.”

“It hurts when a man is ejected on

a questionable call, especially in
such a crucial game.” said head
"coach Joe Luxbacher. “Craig was
merely trying to put the ball back in
play: He wasn’t trying to seek an
advantage by moving down the field
as the referee insinuated. I do_n’t
think there really was a call to/be
made. ,
.A“Yet they were a strong team, and
it was a good game,” continued
Luxbacher. “The outcomgmay have
been difficult had we played with a
full lineup. Although we‘didn’t play
especially well; we-did play hard,
andsometimes that’s what counts.”
Freund agrees -that had. he
remained in the,’ game, the final
could have been different. “Before I

' was thrown out, we had begun to

play re-ally well. We were on top of
the game. But it seemed that our
opportunity was abruptly ruined.”
,Freshman Dave Moss views his
teammate’s ejection somewhat dif-
ferently. “We can’t blame the loss
merely on the fact that we were a
player short on the field. We had a
lot of close chances to score, but we
just couldn’tVconnect,” said Moss.
“Nonetheless, it is a tough. way to
end the season, if that’s the end.”
Overall, it has been a good season.
The team has come a long way since
the first game and has established a
firm ‘foundation on which to build.
Pitt has a relatively youngteam, los-
ing only one player this season to
, graduation. ‘.

Spikers win
Pitt classic

Rupp gave a view Irom the court:
“That second game could’ve been
the most important game of the sea-
son. We just decided (a Penn State

win) wasn’t goingto happen. You .

could see it in everybody’s eyes; you

knew they were with you and that ‘

the job would get dgne.”

In the PSU match alone, Pitt
committed I9 serving errors against
eight service aces — not an enviable
statistic on the surface. However, it
is part of Collier’s serving
philosophy.

Kohutiak explained the reasoning _

behind Pitt’s serves. “We had tp
think, ‘go back and ace it.’ Thats
why so many went into the net and
out of bounds. People were saying
boo-hiss, but we didn't care. We
were thinking ace Lori [Barberich],
ace Marcy [Leap], ace Ellen
[Hensler].” .- V

The win is a conﬁdence booster
going into the Big East champion-
ships next weekend, according to
junior Sally Gillespie. “We’ll be able
to go into our remaining matches

with something to reach back on if —

we ever get into the situation where
it’s a tight match and we have our
doubts," she said. “We may not have
the technique and precision, but it’s
good to know we can fight hard and
come out winners.”

TOURNAMENT NOTES:
The order of finish, first to last,
was Pitt, PSU, Notre Dame,
North Carolina.

The following players were
selected to the all-tournament
team: Lori Barbarich, PSU;
Ellen Hensler, PS U; Linda
Kamtz, UNC; Josie Mater-
nawski, ND; Cathy Rupp, P;
Kris Wexell, P; and MVP Ulana
Kohutiak, Pitt. ‘

Before the match, Women’s
Athletic Director Carol Spargue
presented Belcher, Kohutiak
and Rupp with senior awards. It
was officially announced that
fourth-year player Judy Young
is red-shirted forthe season due
to mononucleosis and will com-
pete next year. Collier extended
his appreciation of trainer Karen
Zanko. “We have a lot‘of injuries
on our team and she's been get-
ting the players ready for games.
A lot of credit should go to her.”

Pheonix, Ariz,(UPI) — Free
agent Maurice Lucas ended his
holdout on Saturday and came to
terms with the Phoenix Suns of the
National Basketball Association.
The Suns’ general manager Jerry
Colangelo says it works out-to be a
one year contract with an option for
a second year. The agreement is
reportedly worth somewhere
between $700,000 and $750,000 per
year, but the exact amount was not
released. There is only one problem;

. the Suns have posted a perfect 5-0

record with Lucas out of the line-up,
as they defeated the Dallas Maver-
icks Saturday night by a score of
105-93. Suns coach -John Macleod
says he doesn’t yet know where he
will work Lucas into the lineup.
Lucas is a ten-year veteran.

NEW ORLEANS (UPI) — The

defeated the Saints in New Orleans
by the score of 23-13. The victory,
which is their second in a row, lifted
the Packers record to 3-7. Lynn
Dickey had a good day for the pack

as he completed 15 of 28 passes with

two touchdowns to tight end Paul
Coffman. Al Del Greco added three
field goals to complete the scering
for the packers. ‘

The lone Saint touchdown was
scored by Wayne Wilson on a l-yard
run. The loss dropped the Saints
further out of playoff contention,

Volleyball team K-Os No. 7 Penn State

By Laurie Kubll
The PM News

The time came for the Pitt
women's voleyball team (22-6) to
defeat Penn State (23-3), and the
spikers couldn’t have done it at a
bettertime. The host team defeated
PSU, ranked seventh in the NCAA_,
15-11, 17-15, 15-13 en route to win-
ning the Pitt Classic this weekend in
Fitzgerald Fieldhouse. Pitt had not
defeated PSU since 1982.

“They deserved to win,” said PSU
head coach Russ Rose after the
game. “Pitt was into it more than we
were, and we were not in the flow of
our game. -No one, on my team

_ played well.

“To them, (winning) gives them
bragging rights," he continued,
“ours are being ranked seventh in
the country. This loss does not end
my day. Well still be ranked
tomorrow.” '

The perspective of Pitt head coach
Shelton Collier is obviously differ-
ent. “I would rank this win right at

the top with our Pepperdine win sev-
eral years ago,” he said. “It’s great to
beat a Top 10 team, and great that it
happened to be Penn State.

“I think a lot of people get sick
and tired of hearing about Penn
State all the time," Collier asserted.
“Our players and staff are definitely
in that group and channeled that

,energy into the match.”

Ulana Kohutiak was voted tour-
nament MVP, and setter Cathy
Rupp and outside hitter Kris Wexell
were selected to the all-tournament
team. '

Pitt defeated Notre Dame (12-12)
and North Carolina (9-17) previous
to the Penn Sta_te match. North
Carolina lost to Pitt Friday night
l5-ll, 15-7, 15-7. Kohutiak led all
spikers with 19 kills and only three
errors. "

“I think we’re just a better volley-
ball team than North Carolina,”
Collier said. “It was a good win for
us representing the Big East Confer-
ence against the defending Atlantic
Coast Conference champions.”

Collier said that NC’s Jill Berke-
bile overshadowed middle blocker

Sue Hoover dinks against PSU just hours laftefsustaining an ankle injury. Kris Wexell (I0) and Cathy Rupp watch.

SYRACUSE, N.Y. — Foge Fazio
spoke publicly of a dream. Usually
dream-chasing comes after the first
or _second football game of the sea-
son, when‘ the squad gropes for a
se_ason—long identity. But when that
same squad possesses a winning per-
centage of .111 nine games later, a
little exercise in reverie can't hurt
any.

“If we can play as well all game as
we did in the-fourth quarter,” Fazio
said following the Panthers’ 13-7
loss to Syracuse Saturday after-

 

Revenge

yesterday.

Press Box  
The End 4

In its final game of the season, the Pitt soccer team
lost by one after Craig F reund was ejected with 12
minutes remaining.

The Pitt hockey team avenged itself for a disap-
pointing game last week by defeating IUP

noon, “then we'll be in pretty good
shape."

. Pitt looked-out of shape for the
first three quarters in the Carrier
Dome but kept 46,489 fans on their
feet until the game's final play as the
Panthers totally . dominated the
fourth quarter. By the time quarter-
back John Comgemi ignited Pitt’s
second drive of the quarter, a woeful

offense suddenly anddeftly moved
the ball.

.A maniacal defense inexplicably:

couldn’t contain Congemi’s rollouts
or scrambling before his scoring
keeper with 8:27 to go. But the gne
play that made it all happen was a
halfback option to Craig “Ironhead”
Heyward, who ﬂoated a dizzy pass
40 yards to ﬂanker Chuck Scales.

“It was just a halfback pass,”

Scales said. “He put it up and I got it. "

I had to come back to the defender
[Ron Hobby] and reach for the
ball.” . , -.
All the while Pitt kept the Orange-
menscoreless while Congemi was
intercepted once and another drive
stalled. Suspense waited for the final
°e.ri_es when Congemi passed for
three first downs,'.split end Bill Wal-
lace got 20 on one catch requiring
some sideline ‘ballet "work and SU
helped out with a 10-yard holding
call. It was not enough. One of the
nation’s top defenses.hurig tight as
with six _seconds left Hobby batted
away a 20-yard scoring strike to
Scales in the endzone. »
“[Congemi] could go either way,

s

strong side or weak side," Scales
said. “On the last drive, they were in
a prevent defense with two guys up
on bothreceivers.” _

“I took a look at everything," said
Congemi, who started for the first
time in three weeks and completed
l0 ‘of. 22 passes for 120 yards. “I
thought we had a chance at the weak
side. I took a chance. It could have

- been interference [on Hobby]. It

might not have been interference.”

“It showed our guys fought to the
end,” Fazio said of his l-7-l team.
“People say we’re l-7, we’re easy to
throw against in the fourth quarter.
Well, "they showed backbone and
how to come back; Unfortunately,
time ran out.”

Conversely, the Panthers had

Sue Hoover for the four years they
were teammates at Richland High
School. “I know she was anxious to
demonstrate her improvement in
this match and playedreal well.”
Pitt defeated Notre Dame Satur-

day afternoon 15-4, 15-ll, 15-l0.-3:,

“Before the match, we discussed the

5 fact that this was Pitt-Notre Dame

and that our athletic. director, Dr.
Bozik, the university community
would really be able to relate to a
Fighting Irish win. As a result, we
played one of the best defensive
matches of the season,” said Collier.

Hoover was carried off the court
in the second game when she came
down from a block and landed on a
teammate’s foot, spraining her
ankle. Consequently, Pat Belcher,

whom Collier was saving for them“

PSU match, was forced to play, and’
freshman Krista Zeiner also stepped
in to replace Hoover. “On our team,
it’s not a matter of who sits out, it's
more like the six players that can
walk have to play. We’re getting
good at making the best.of tough
situations,” said Collier. Wexell had
a season-high 11 kills.

The match with Penn State was by
no stretch of the imagination a cer-
tain win. Pitt won the first game but ‘
fell behind ll—3 before staging a_

nearly impossible comeback. “Wei:

could have deflated but really fought
back,” said Collier. “Freshman
Louise O’Shaughnessy brought us
back with some great serving, and
we scored ll straight points to go up
l4-ll.”

The game apparently ended when

_ Kohutiak slammed a quick set from

Rupp, and Pitt began to celebrate.

However, a delayed net_ violatiorif,
was called against Kohutiak, and

PSU _had a second chance.’-The
Lions tied up the game when Pitt
failed to score with its serves and
PSU scored on a service ace and a
stuff block of Kohutiak’s spike.

“It’s really hard not to be affected
by a situation where you think
you’ve won and you’re forced to play
again to win,” Collier noted. “PSU is
ranked. seventh because of their con-
sistency, and we are not known fo

' our consistency but for our ﬁghting’

spirit.” - _
