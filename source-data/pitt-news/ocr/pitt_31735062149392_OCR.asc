Athletics

Western Group
Leader Advises

University

Steps in increasing the workability
of the “Code Bowman” were effected
during the mid-term interim when
the announcements of a “cooperative
agreement with the Big Ten” was
made by James Hagan, athletic di-
rector, and recommendations for im-
provement in its administration were
made by the Alumni investigating
committee.

By the agreement the University
became a non-participating member
of the Western Conference. Univer-
sity athletics are placed under the
jurisdiction of the Commissioner of
the Conference, Major John L. Grif-
fith, who will render the same serv-
ice for the University as he does for
the Conference members. ‘

This places the University under no
obligation to the Conference, but al-
lows Commissioner Griﬁ“1th to judge
and advise on any problems concern-
ing eligibility, subsidization, and
proselyting that may be charged
{against the school.

According to the terms of the
agreement, the Commissioner will be
given full information respecting the
present status of athletics at the Uni-
versity, and the facts will then be
made known to all interested.

This means that the University will
have the services of a neutral official,
who will be free to pass on to the
public or rival institutions all infor-
mation regarding the conduct of ath-
letics at Pitt.

The result of‘ intensive investiga-
tion, the alumni report was submitted
to Chancellor John G. Bowman. Only
a general summary was made public.

‘Put ’em on Ice!’
Suggests Hagan

“Put them on ice,” said James Ha-
gan, director of athletics, referring to
the exam—weary Pitt student body.

Maybe those Weren’t his exact
words, but they convey the general
idea responsible for the ﬂooding of
the Stadium running track for ice
skating.

Just two weeks ago, skating en-
thusiasts awoke from their examin-
ation lethargy to ﬁnd large signs
spotted at different points on camp-
us, bearing the Words, “Ice Skating
at the Stadium Today.” '

Investigation proved that the flood-
ing of the running track had provid-
ed a near-perfect skating surface, 15
feet wide and a quarter of a mile
long. With it went the promise
that, dependent upon the weather,
the surface would be available for
the rest of the winter.

Armament Plan

AUSTIN, Texas. Fob. \'i.—Seven-
tenths of American college students
today approve of the plan to train
20,000 civilian pilots a year in col-
lcges and universities of the nation,
a country-wide poll of the Student
Opinion Surveys of America shows.

When the President asked Con-
gress to appropriate $10,000,000 for
training aviators in cooperation with
educational institutions, he was al-
loting college men their part in the
task of rearming the United States.
The Surveys have conducted this sci-
entiﬁc sampling exclusively for The
News and the seventy—six other
sponsoring student newspapers
throughout the nation.

Collegians everywhere have been
asked, “Do you approve of President
Roosevelt’s plan to train an air re-
serve corps of 20,000 men now in
college?”

YES . . . . . . . . . .71.8 per cent

  Roosevelt Gains

In Popularity

AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 6. — The
world is witnessing a perplexing situ-
ation in American politics: a presi-
dent going into the last half of his
second term, with strong opposition
to his startling policies—but still with
the conﬁdence of the majority of the
people.

In fact. due to his stand on import-
ant national and international issues
his popularity has risen, somewhat.
«The president’s stand on the Nazi
treatment of the Jews, the Lima con-
ference, trade treaties with Great
Britain, and rearmament are gener-
ally considered to have public favor.

In a sampling referendum conduct-

ed for The News and scores of other
cooperating college newspapers, the
;Student Opinion Surveys of America
ishow that 65.5 per cent of the stu-
dents “generally approve of Roose-
3 velt today as president.” The survey
. included students of all shades of po-
litical affiliation.

This ﬁgure, however, does not mean
that they would like to see him run
for a third term, for only 28.2 per
cent answer yes to that question.
The most signiﬁcant deduction of the
results of this poll is that although
the students like the president they
don't want him to be a candidate
again.

The Surveys, recently organized for
sounding out campus opinion, have

velt, so it is possible to determine his
trend of popularity on the colleges.

An Editorial
T ODAY, The News, with the cooperation of many campus activi-
ties and leaders. announces the formation of a committee to ex-
plore the possibilities of providing the means to continue the educa-
tion at the University of some refugee students.

The idea, we are convinced, is one worthy of deep considera-
tion. Educators and students have continually deplored suppres-
sion of academic freedom by the Nazi machine, by the other oppres-
sive governments whose agencies of “education” are no longer
accessible to all classes and creeds.

But deploring is not enough. Something more than a “My!
My! Isn't that terrible‘.?” negativism is necessary. Thus we believe
that by raising funds to bring to the local campus certain of these
refugee students, so that they may continue their education here, a
deﬁnite postive contribution will be made.

The News has temporarily taken the lead in the formation of
this committee, which is being organipecl on the broadest possible
basis to include representatives of as many student elements. as
well as the faculty, as possible. But this is deﬁnitely 11ot a Pitt
News committee. It is student-faculty group, which, once deﬁnitely
organized. should proceed with its important task independently
and as a distinct and separate activity.

The success of this plan, of course, depends in great measure
on the cooperation of students, faculty, and University officials, all
of whom, thus far, have exhibited a spirit of interest and willingness.

VVe realize the need for proceeding' cautiously, for making this
more than a “ﬂy-by-nigl1t” scheme. There will be difficulties, per-
haps, in selecting‘ students, in bringing tliem to the University.
Once here, they must be provided for, not only for one year, but for
their entire stay. Care must be taken to avoid disappointment;
long—range, careful provisions must be made.

The idea is far from new. Many colleges and universities have
already conducted similar drives, with, in the main, a great degree
of success. The students and faculty of the University, we feel,
should play a part i11 this movement. . . . not only because of the
broad principles of education and tolerance involved, but also in
view of the composition of the student body, with its many nation-
ality, cultural, and racial groups.

It is a project which can be made far moreeffective than pages
of vituperative. print or scathing speeches; -it’s the least we ca.11 do
in a world in which intellectual and moral standards are fast being
trampled byforces of individual greed a.nd rampant nationalism.

Plans also call for the formation ofa
faculty advisory committee, under
the leadership of Dr. Francis D. Ty__-,
son, professor of economics, which
will be announced later this we-ck.<

Object of the proposed drive is to
provide sufficient funds, by some
method of student and faculty solici-
tation or contribution, to enable stu-
dents from Germany and other Euro-
pean states, victims of racial, re-
ligious, and educational intolerance,
to continue theiir interrupted educa-

The committee will determine the
number of students which can be
provided for and will attemptto de-I
ﬁne some method or methods of pro-
cedure in raising funds and making
arrangements to bring the refugee
students to the University.

Administration Cooperates 

Assurances of administration co-
operation in the student-faculty drive
were transmitted to. The ‘News last
week by Rufus Fitzgerald, University
provost. Considerable interest has
also been aroused in faculty circles.

The campaign here is similar: (to
those conducted successfully this win-
ter in numerous colleges and univer-
sities. Successful drives have beént
held at Harvard, Northweste1‘n,"Dar_t'-«
mouth, Swarthmore, Yale, North-
eastern, and many other institutions.

In these campaigns, funds were
raised- to provide for anywhere from.‘
one to 20 refugee students. The lat-
ter number was attained at Harvard
under the direction of a student com-
mittee with the aid of a faculty ad-'-.
Visory group. I "

Scholarships Provided

In most cases, scholarships were
provided by the respective universi-
ties with the provision that the stu-
dent committees raise funds for ro_6nTi,
board, and other expenses. . In some
cases, certain interested student
groups took complete charge of ar-
rangements. '  -' "

Only recently, a committee whs
formed in New York city to coordi-
nate the drives on various campuses,
and to provide a medium for inter-

On Public Relations

URING the past week, the Pitt body athletic has been exhumed,
another autopsy has been performed, and deﬁnite provision made
for a periodical re-examination by an impartial, outside examiner.

’l‘hus, in one fell swoop, while assiduously avoiding “washing
its dirty linens in public,” the University and its atliletic department,
has submitted to an appraisal of its athletic policy, the Code Bow-
man has taken its place in distinguished company, and a deﬁnite bet-
tering of public relations has been effected.

The recent’ report of the alumni committee, though rather ab-
stract and unsensational as abridged for public consumption, con-
tained some interesting reconiniendations for improving personnel
relations, and for providing more efﬁcient administration of athletic
affairs. The keynote of the whole report, however, was struck in the
last paragraph, which ran something like this . . . “The best way to
correct such a condition is to prevent, as far as possible, the incidents
which are certain to result i11 bad publicity . . .”

\Ve agree with the committee that representatives of the press
have no axe to grind, have really been forced into their late criticisms
of the Univcrsity’s athletic policy. Much of the recent unpleasant-
ness with the newspapers has been the result of a. poor public rela-
tions policy.

Recent moves, however, have been encouraging. The new tie-up
with the Big Ten was mainly an important public relations gesture.

The possibility that the Big Ten may soon have a new full-time
member seems too remote at present to be concerned about. But
the fact remains that one constructive step has been taken in an at-
tempt to remedy the conditions responsible for bad publicity.

VVe hopethis is only the beginning in the direction of a more
frank, intelligent athletic policy which will clear up some of the haze
that has been lingering about the athletic office in recent times.

-.-..- The following is an account by a former University student, John

"- -PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia.—After travelling leisurely through France
and Switzerland, I arrived in Prague on September 5, 1938. The train, as
gontinental third class trains go, was packed; and the Wilson railway sta-
tidnwas thronged with a struggling mass of excited humanity. . "

Newsboys seemed to be doing a booming trade with the evening edi-
'tions—everyone of them was shouting a phrase which I interpreted as “Na-

tional Defense.” It made me feel‘¢
uneasy for a moment because this
city would likely be a future battle-
ﬁeld.

this had only one
meaning for me,
and that was war.

In addition, the populace was in-

times. As a result, one would see
house wives shopping with gas masks
strapped over their shoulders; school
children could be seen going to
school with gas masks slung over
their arms; and all business estab-

case the signal were given that there
was gas in the air. ‘

About September 19, the American
consul sent a warning to all American
citizens registered with the consulate
to leave the country. However, the
situation was too interesting for me
to leave so I decided to “stick it out”
a little longer.

On the evening of September 23, at
10:20 p. m., a general Czechoslovak
mobilization was announced over the
radio. Immediately all the eligible
young men in the republic were on
their way to register for military
service.

On September 24, I received an-
other warning from the consul to get

I wanted to get to Budapest as soon
as possible so I walked approximate-
ly six miles until I got to the rail-
road station. I had no money to buy
my fare.

In spite of this inconvenience, I
boarded the next train to Budapest
and hoped for the best of luck. The
Hungarian conductor tried to put me
ioﬁ the train, but after arguing back
' and forth he consented to let me ride
to Budapest if I would leave my only
traveling bag with him as security for
the fare.

I reached Budapest very late that
evening. I did not have any Hun-
gzxrian money (pengas) with which to
buy some food or to rent a room for a
:~ight’s lodging. So I slept in the
railroad in Budapest that evening.

From here on, the breaks came my
way. The next morning I inquired
about the location of the American
legation quarters and, following di-
rections, I was successful in locating
the American consul. He lent me
some money and after two days rest
he helped me to buy my fare to
'?aris. I stayed in Paris for 14 days

before I returned to Prague.

, ‘service had been disrupted, because:

 

“Joseph and His Brethren.”

That title, Fein, will never sell in
the Midwest.

It seems this Joseph’s brothers
don’t like him because their old man
gave him a swell outﬁt, all colors.
So they take him out and throw him
in a pit.

It seems such a little thing to
throw him in a pit for. Is it a jun-
gle picture‘?

No.

Didn’t we produce that story
once? It sounds familiar.

I don’t think so. Anyway, they

'say whadda we wanna kill him for,

we can sell him as a slave to this
merchant, who is coming up over the
hill. Swell shot in technicolor.

Does he sing with the other slaves,
like in the Scarlett picture‘? We
could make it a musical.

Naw, it’s not in the Old South. It’s
in Egypt. B. C. On the desert.

Maybe Valentino did it.

He couldn’t have. This book only
came out a couple years ago. Well,
the brothers spill blood on Joseph’s
coat and send it back to the old man,
so he’ll think the kid is dead. And
the merchant takes Joseph into
Egypt-

Has the merchant got a daugh-
ter?

My wife didn’t say. We could have
one, though. Finally, the merchant
delivers Joseph to the captain of the
guard, fellow named Pottypoor, or
something. And the guy has a beau-
tiful wife. She falls right there for
Joseph, and makes eyes at him. He.
don’t want to be bothered, though. So
she writes him letters.

Right in the same house?

It’s a big place. Well, she gets him
alone in her apartment—this is a big
sc-ene—and when he discovers what
she’s up to, hetries to escape. So
she tears off his clothes-

That’ll never get past the Hays of-
ﬁce.

And he runs out.
fuss and shows the clothes to her
husband and tells him Joseph at-
tacked her. _

He gets in a lot of trouble over
clothes, don’t he? Maybe we could
work it into the title.

So Pottypoor throws Joseph in
prison.

Then what happens?

That’s all.

Whadda ya mean that’s all? You
can’t end a story like that. It has

no point. _

‘Well, that’s where this guy stop-
ped. My wife says he writes a lit-
tle more every year or so. I was
thinking we could get him to finish
it up quick.

Does he work for us?

No. He’s a professor.

We could send him a check for a
couple thousand andhave somebody
here ﬁnish the story. We could
say, “From an idea suggested by,”
and he couldn’t sue us.

Fein goes out. Golden makes
notes on pad. Fein comes back
in, excited.

Know what, boss? We won’t have
to send the guy a check after all. The
whole stoi'y’s in the Bible.

Penn

“Trade Winds” isn’t the best pic-
ture the Penn marquee has advertis-
ed, but you’ll ﬁnd it pleasing enter-
tainment. Plot, ancient vintage, is
handled nicely. Heroine Joan Ben-
net (Kay Kerrigan.) supposedly kills
a man. Heroine runs away.

San Francisco’s police commission-
er, who accuses his department of
not being able to trace a puppy with
muddy feet across a white bed sheet,
hires private investigator Fredric
March (Sam Wye) to track her down.
He leaves with Ralph Bellamy
(Blodgett) of the ’Frisco force who
eats his mints “double strength?’ and
who can’t recognize a clue when it
comes and sits down on his badge.

The story has a nice tricky end-
ing which I’m not going to reveal.
Why should I tell you when it had
me fooled?

Another erroneous statement was
the declaration that almost 70 per
cent of the representatives were
from the New York district.” The
oﬁicial credentials report at the con-
vention was as follows:

331 delegates from 120 out-of-

then what does he consider to be
adequate national defense? The
American Student Union did not un-
dertake a hasty answer to this latter
question, but is submitting the mat-
ter to a national referendum. I sub-
mit that this is neither a hysterical
nor a jingoistic position.

The concern of the American Stu-
dent Union continues to be with
keeping our own country out of War.
As we declared in our Human Rights
roll call, “The fate of American
democracy cannot be divorced from
the fate of human rights throughout
the world. Our democracy must be
protected from attacks within by
meeting the needs of its people and
from attacks without by avoiding
any action which will encourage,
build up and assist an aggressor.” We
believe that this position is a sensi-
ble one. We believe that this posi-
tion is one that is shared by the vast
majority of American students.

Very truly yours,

Joseph P. Lash,
Executive Secretary.

By

From the

Shoulder

Leonard Levison
Sports Editor

Nothing, not even a temporary abandonment in classes, is able
to change the "never-a-dull-nioment-here" life in Pitts department

of athletics. But. while the pace

that has kept the Panthers very

much in the headlines and over the wire service continued uninter-

rupted, the melody was in a distinctly different key. This time the

Panther, whose hair has been so mussed up in recent months, came out
0

with a clean face. ;

Yes, the boys who sit behind the;

typewriters and who, because of cer- 
tain happenings, have been steeping;
-‘the University in sensationalism, were 9
given the opportunity they insist they
have been long awaiting. They were
given the chance to use some very
nice words in talking about the Uni-
versity’s athletic policy.

And they remained true to their
word. The clippings that followed
the announcement of Pitt’s “co-oper-
ative agreement with the Big Ten
Conference” should rate the first
page in Jimmy Hagan’s scrapbook.

Public Relations Gesture

For a public relations policy that
had become notorious was dramatic-
ally reversed. The companionship
that has been consummated with the
Big Ten does nothing if it does not
tremendously boster Pitt’s public
name. It does that.

Sheathed in highest athletic re-
spectability, the Western Conference
now doffs its halo to Pitt. Privilege
that was besmirched in the past few
months is not only restored, but con-
siderably enhanced.

After the past occurrences, this ap-
peared to be almost an impossibility.
At least it seemed impossible in so
short a time. The impossible, how-
ever, has apparently been achieved.

Codes Not Same

It is with open arms that we wel-
come Major Griffith. And we con-
gratulate Director Jimmy Hagan for
the move, that whatever else it rep-
resents, it stands as the outstanding
public relations gesture of many Pitt
years.

As for the other ramiﬁcations of
Panther shoulder-rubbing with the
Big Ten, comment can be derived
from nothing but inferences. The
big inference is that Pitt is getting
ready to pull into the Big Ten. This

is strictly in the realm of conjecture,

\

In Again, Out

Runners, Center of Olson,

however, and remains nothing but a
very questionable inference.

One thing that stands in the way of
this coming true in a satisfactory
manner is that Pitt, while fraterniz—
ing with the Conference, is not on
what may be called equal terms.

Furthermore, the fact that Pitt has
a working arrangement with the
Conference authorities does not put
Pitt on an equal basis. Nor should
anyone think that the things that
happen in the Big Ten are going to
happen at Pitt.

Code Bowman Stricter

For, Pitt has the “Code Bowman”
and the Western Conference has its
own set of rules. The documents are
not the same. Pitt’s code is far
stricter.

And the arrangement that Pitt has
with the Western Conference is noth-
ing more than that the machinery
that the Conference uses, notably
Major Griffith to see that its mem-

-bers obey the rules, shall be used to

see that Pitt obeys its rules.

The Conference becomes a desir-
able front for Pitt. But, the confer-
ence has its rules and lives up to
them, and the Panthers have their
rules, by which they will abide.

Thus, the latest move should not
be inferred as anything more than a
ﬁne public relations move. It cer-
tainly does nothing to relieve the in-
ternal problems of the “Code Bow-
man.” Basic adjustments have yet to
be made. The alumni report has
pointed out many of them.

What Follows?

Bad publicity was one big prob-
lem. A constructive step has been
taken to remedy it. Will the other,
and more elementary, readjustments
follow? Will the causes of bad pub-
licity be removed?

The headache has been cured with
a pill. Now, will steps be taken to
wipe out the cancerous growth that
caused that headache?

Squahhle

By Bill Mazefsky _ .   A .
When the Allegheny Mountain Associat_ion"'of t’he___:A'.  U; de-

cided not to issue permits for Pitt

trackmen to compete in last ‘Sat-

urday’s Millrose Games, the national lieadquarters of the A. A. U.
overruled the local organization, and the Panther contingent, accord-
ing to Olson pre-meet plans, were able to break tape. at_ New York’s

annual track classic.

The current squabble involves per-¢

sonalities and issues that were not
ended by the decision of the national
A. A. U. By competing without the
customary travel-
ing permit which
is issued all local
athletes by the A.
M. A., the Panther
athletes automat-
i c a l ly suspended
themselves, say the
oﬂicials of the 10-
cal group.

The A. M. A. re-
fused to grant the
p e r in its because
Jimmy Hagan, Pitt
athletic director,
recently informed
the amateur gov- Olson
erning body that Pitt students will
not be permitted to compete in local
open meets, except as “unattached.”
The A. M. A. has contended that if
the Panther trackmen compete under
university colors in the major meets
in the East they must retain the same
status for local meets.

When Pitt was refused permits,
it applied to National Secretary
Dan Ferris, who ﬁrst backed the A.
M. A. After a reversal of this posi-
tion, Judge Samuel Hoyt of New
Haven, national president of the A.
A. U. favored Pitt in over-ruling the
local body.

William S. Haddock, president of
the A. M. A. immediately protested
to Judge Hoyt that the latter’s office
overstepped the bounds of its author-
ity in countermanding the local de-
cision, Haddock intends to bring the
matter to a head at the next national

 

Meanwhile the rather involved red
tape of the bureaucratic policy of the
A. M. A. has involved the amateur
status of the Pitt athletes who com-
peted in the Millrose games. Johnny
Woodruﬁf, Frank Ohl, Al Ferrara, Al
McKee, and Ken Ryden will be af-
fected if the local body succeeds in
reversing the reversal of the nation-
al outﬁt.

In this event not only will the Pitt »

men be affected but all the athletes
who competed in the Millrose games
will have their amateur standing
tainted. And that seems to be a stiff

‘ price to pay for an. argument,.which

may chieﬂy sprout from "dislike be-
tween A. M. A. ofﬁcials and Carl
Olson, Pitt track coach. ‘

Pitt is scheduled to compete in the
Penn A. C. games next Friday, the
Boston A. A. games on Saturday, and
the New York A C. games "‘on- Feb-
ruary 18. All of these meets are A.
A. U. affairs, and Haddock claims that
there will be no shift in the A. M. A.
stand. Pitt, then, will have to keep
the wires to Ferris and Judge Hoyt
open in order to keep overriding the
decision of local officials.

And if at the national meeting the
Hoyt decision is tossed overboard by
the national group then nearly all the
Eastern cindermen will be black-
listed because of their contact with
the tainted Pitt trackmen.

Pitt Pucksters
Favored Over

Punchless Plaid

Still very much in the thick of the
Ohio-Pennsylvania Eastern division
despite a defeat by Duquesne, the
Panther icers rate odds on favorites
against a badly crippled Tech team
tomorrow night.

The Tartans have had nothing but
bad luck this season. Opening the
year with a team that had improved
almost to championship calibre, the
Techs took it on the chin time after
time from injuries and scholastic re-
quirements.

Exactly seven of the 15 men on the
original Tech squad should be non-
combatants against the Panthers.
High scoring center Jack Culver has
left school, defensemen Goldsmith
and Havlische are scholastically in-
eligible. and the same applies to wing

two successive days.

West Virginia and Penn State will
engage the Jungle Cats on a home

ing the locals in a total of eight

Indiana Teachers complete the sched-
ule.

Candidates Report

Only one engagement has been
carded for the freshman team, the
Panther Cubs going to State College
on May 20 to tangle with the Penn
State frosh, but Director Hagan has
stated that other schools have been
contacted and the freshman schedule
will be enlarged.

Not to be caught short by the re-
port that Bucky Harris has his Wash-
ington Nationals rookies out for
spring training already, Panther
coach Ralph Mitterling has announc-
ed that he will call out varsity and
freshman candidates early this month
for preliminary workouts.

Mitterling, a former Philadelphia‘
Athletic outﬁelder and a baseball
coach for 20 years, is anxious to get a
line on his batterymen and will pro-
bably use the Stadium basketball
ﬂoor for practices. While batting
would be an impossibility indoors, all
the players 'will have a chance to
work the frost out of their throwing
arms.

Last spring’s intramural tourna-
ment, which put nearly 500 men into
action, will probably supply Mitter-
ling with most of his material. Var-
sity gridmen should get several spots
with the Mitterling Maulers, Ben
Kish, Frank Goodell, Rudy Gradisek,
Joe Rettinger, and John Chickerneo
probably leading the race for regular
berths.

The hurling department should be
entirely adequate with ﬂingers Brown,
Timko, Lawry, and Troy battling for
starting jobs with Kish and Eddie

Goodell, Gradisek and Rettinger are
top candidates for the mask and mitt
position, but Bill Schildecker, sopho-
more hockeyite, may give the boys a
stiff. workout.

Outstanding inﬁelders of the intra-
mural league who look like varsity
bets are Bob Funkhouser, Al Hol-
brook, Larry Peace, and Eddie
Hughes. The latter is also a cracker-
jack outﬁelder.
