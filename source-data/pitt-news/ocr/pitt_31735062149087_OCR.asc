Publication Delayed

Pitt Panther Changes issue Date
Because of ‘Stop Press’ Order

Originally scheduled to appear onfr‘

campus this morning, the February
silver anniversary edition of The Pitt
Panther will not appear because of a
“stop press” order, Tom Smith, C39,
announced.

Smith refused to comment on the
delay and changes in publication, but
intimated that the delay had occur-
red through no fault of his.

The plentiful pixilated Pitt Panth-
er, Pittsburgh’s panoramic picture of
people and puns, launches forth at
8:30 Wednesday morning upon a
golden era of maturity with a “Silver
Anniversary Edition,” the climax of
25 years of gleaming success.

Well on the road to Social Security,
The Panther will need no Con-
gressional investigation after open-
ing the record Wednesday and
spreading a well-worn diary to pub-
lic consternation, Smith maintains.

He..promises_-a ﬂock of “good jokes
worth retelling,” a cross-section of

the nation’s foremost college cartoons,
and a. complete confession of the
pranks and policies of past Panther
editors and alumni.

Dedicated to “ iat famous Amer-
ican institution, the Quarter,” The
Panther will brush off its birth certi-
ﬁcate and plug anew as Pittsburgh’s
monthly. Conceived in the Schenley
Grill, The Panther was born late one
night in ’14, crying aloud beneath the
Chancellor’s desk and progressively
crying aloud today behind the desk
in 804—so writes associate editor
Frank Miller, C41.

Proof that Adam took “two Panth-
ers into the Ark,” Wednesday’s issue
will trace the longevity of the
sprightly creature, page by page and
year by year, through 25 epochs of
University — and Panther — history.
Smith advises the student body to
have 15 cents handy in order to date
Pauline, The Panther’s woman, at
the basement elevator shaft.

Men’s Glee Club will give the ﬁrst
performance of its annual concert at
‘the Stephen Foster Memorial, an-
nounces Clarence Shepard, C40, man-
zager.

A second performance will follow
‘Friday night.

Boasting alumni from 49 years

,back, since 1890, the musical organ-.

ization hopes to carry on a tradition-‘
al activity with the alumni present‘
Thursday night. The graduate mem— ~
bers of the Glee Club will ﬁle from
the audience to the stage to sing to-
gether with the active choristers,
“Prayer of Thanksgiving” and “Hail
to Pitt.”

Some of the men’s fraternities have
announced intentions of attending
the Friday night performance en
masse before going downtown for the
Inter—Fraternity Ball, while several
women’s fraternities have decided to
include one of the concert nights in
their rushing program.

Tickets for either night may be
secured in exchange for the ticket
numbered 36 in the student activities
book today and tomorrow from 1 to
4 o’clock in 801 Cathedral and on the

ground ﬂoor. An exchange ticket
will entitle the holder to one admis-
sion for the ﬁrst ﬂoor and ﬁrst bal-
cony.

University to Celebrate Charter Day
With Dance, Tea in Commons Room

Faculty, Friends
See Girl Portraits
Gt Breckenridges

(Pictures on Page 4)
Members of the faculty and

1- their wives will celebrate the one

hundred and ﬁfty-second Univer-
sity Charter Day by viewing‘ the
recently acquired portraits of
Hugh Henry Brackenridge and

I Sabina‘ Wolfe Brackenridge, tomor-

row afternoon in the office of Dr.
John G. Bowman, chancellor of the
University.

Inconunction with the review, tea
will be served in a cornerof the
Commons Room after the faculty
have seen the portraits.

George Hubbard Clapp, president

I of the University board of trustees,

acquired both portraits for the Uni-
versity ‘collection from Joseph Mc-
Kibben, of'St. Paul, Minnesota, early
in January.

Because Hugh Henry Breckinridge
was instrumental in securing the

, charter for the University, Chancellor

Bowman feels that an official review
of the portraits is appropriate, as the
center of a Charter Day celebration.
The portrait of Hugh Breckinridge
was painted by Gilbert Stuart, the
artist who created the unﬁnished
of George Washington.
Rembrandt Peale, another eighteenth
century artist, painted Sabina VVolfe
Breckinridge about the same time.
Judge Breckinridge went as a leg-
islator to the Pennsylvania state leg-
islator meeting at Philadelphia in
1786, to secure a charter for the old

Pittsburgh Academy granted in 1787.

Miss Genevieve Blatt, executive
direc’t‘or‘of*'ICG';“has advised all dele-
gates to begin the drafting of bills in

preparation and study which pre-
cedes it. There can be no intelligent
discussion of legislation without care-
ful preliminary worrk.”

meeting is not only for the discus-
sion of bills to be considered, but also
to give the delegates a better under-
standing of parliamentary law and
parliamentary procedure. This week-
ly practice will enable them to un-
derstand fully the workings of a mod-
el state legislature.

commend the work that the intercol-
legiate Conference on Government
has been and is doing in Pennsyl-
Vania.”

organized by the University delega-
tion: labor, agriculture, ﬁnance,
health, welfare, public works, natural

An Expcrirncnt

A In Heinz Chapel

i

dedication of I-Ieiuz Chapel last November is

now only an outstanding entry in the Univer-
sitv's l1l;~;‘t()1‘l(:21l diary. The tiny cliapcl has since
lost most of its “newness,” has g'l'il(lllEl.l.l_V slipped
into its natural place as an l11t€g'l‘dl unit of the
Uiiivcirsity qiiadraiiglc.

That this should happen is only a natural de-
velopment, quitc in the scheme of ‘tliiiigs. For the
new is alw:-iys greeted with a burst of enthusiasm,
followed soon by a state of casual iiitcrcst and
curiosity which eveiitii-ally resolves itself into mere
passive acceptance.

Thus we were interested to licar that the Univer-
sity has appointed a religious direc‘i'oi', who will
conduct, for at least a trial period of two months,
non-scctariaii services at twice—weckly intervals
and Sunday afternoon services.

The Chapel so far has rightly been an object
of worship for its beauty and arcliitecture. Un-
doubtedly one of the most costly pieces of architec-
ture in the world, it has ir.«1p1*e.~_;scd student and
faculty with its appropi-'ia‘ic Gothic design, has
awed and inspired them witli its beautiful sculpture
and stained glass windows poi'ti'aying the noble
virtues of nian.

All tliis l_ic:iii‘~.‘_'~,' worsliip, we think, is ﬁne and
coiniiicndalile. But it rczilly shoiilcl be supplcine.ut-
cd by soino'tl'iiiig more concrete, some more o1'g'an-
izcd expression of religion. M

Consequently, we await with considerable in-

TIIE

lterest, the outcome of the receiitlgv-announced ex:

pci-iiiiciit. It seems to us to be a developinent in

' the right direction.

It will, of course, provide for a wider use of

'- Chapel facilities, will make the chapel more "L'lian
--just a place of ineditz-ition where organ recitals are

given at regular intervals.

By the conducting of iiitcr-sectariaii and inter-
clciibinliiiitioiial services, a great coiitribiition ‘to-
\’v'.‘rll'(l religious tolerance can he inadc. In a Uni-
voi'slt_v, vhcrc Protestants, Catholics, and Jews all

' are licavv elements in the student populatioii, such

services should lead to a better understanding ‘and
cooperation aip_ong members of the Lin1’ei‘c.1it faiths.

J ust how successful the plan will be is a Ina't.tcr
of conjecture. The very fact‘ that it was instituted
for only a trial period indicates that Univcrsity.ofﬁ-
cials are not sure, are feeling their way in the €111'eC'
tion of an adequate program. But it is a welcome
dcvclopineiit, which, we think, should be supported
by Univ .i.:ity students, in its period of trial.

Just on Oversight,
Of Course

HE hue and cry raised by Adolf Hitl'er’s daunt-
lcss and courzigeous editors about the Madison
Elqiiarc Garden Bum “riot” seems typically illog-
ical. In a land where uncouth Ickeses and Roose-
velts and the like dare to go about saying loose

. things about Nazi dicta‘to1'ships, it was, of course,

just an accident, that a meeting of 18,000 Buud
nieiiibeis, pledged to Nazi ideals, was tolerated.
Similarly, the entirely impartial, objective Ger-

- man editors in their hurried analysis of the cable

news, somehow overlooked the fact that a police
cordon of more than 1,500 of New York’s ﬁnest
was provided by Mayor La Giiardia, target of bit-
ter Nazi invcctives, at the price of possible personal

’ unpopularity.

VVc realize, of course, that this was just an over-

‘ sight on the part of the Nazi press. After all, edi-

tors, and even slot-man Hitler do make mistakes.
\V'e know how those things happen.

THE PITT NEWS

Brown Study

by Robert Brown

It seems quite certain that the great powers of the
world will soon be putting their oﬁicial seal of approval
on the bloody butchery that has been going on in Spain
for the past four years. In doing this, they will be turn-
ing their backs on a cause that was doomed from the
start, and will be recognizing a
country which has been in a state
of stagnation for 300 years.

For it has been a long, long time
since proud, imperious Spain held
the destinies of two continents in
her grip. Charles the Fifth, the
pale monarch who was hated by
everyone except the solid little
people of the Netherlands, built up
an empire that was the greatest
ever to appear in modern times.
His son, combining a Catholic
mysticism with a shrewd knowl-
edge of handling people, kept the great, sprawling af-
fair known as the Holy Roman Empire together until a
little upstart of an island up in the North Sea started
Spain on the downward path of dissolution and decay
in 1588.

Spain is a dead country. In the winter, snow skirls
across the barren plateau of Castile, and the summer sun
shines with a cruel, hard light upon the little villages
sprawling at the base of the Pyrenees passes. The In-
quisition, an instrument of racial intolerance which
would make one of Hitler’s concentration camps look
like a playground, drove out the Moors and the Jews,
people who might have reorganized Spain into a sem-
blance of its former self.

When Alphonso made his hasty retreat into exile (and
the Bourbon line is noted for its skill in making tracks
when things look bad) Spain appeared headed for better
times. The Republican government, which was not
really Communistif: but was only attempting to carry out
reforms modeled after the good old American Way, set
out on a program of social reform which was best
adapted to its own peculiar country.

But it has failed. The few hundred sandbags they
are distributing about Madrid are not much of a match
for the Italian bombers which are now free to work out
on the defenseless city.

 

Brown

Spain may yet serve a valuable purpose in being a
grim object lesson for the statesmen who are now en-
gaged in mouthing their hymns of hate. Spain is ruined,
and Franco and shaky German and Italian bonds are not
going to get it in working order again. As it stands,
Spain appears to be the buffer state for France and
Italy, with the possibility that a much greater and more
terrible war will be fought there.

And so this catastrophe is not very unusual. Spain
is simply following out its tradition—-the grim tradition

casually followed the hostilities there must realize that
they have been fully up to snuﬁ, and that compliments
are in order for Germany and Italy in helping things
along so splendidly.

Caucus
by Aiviin lwninisoff

Grapevine isn’t the gloating kind, but be always likes
to do a little I told-you-soing in the course of a conver-
sation. He had a little story about his prowess" the
other day, as a seer, which got us right into the middle
of an argument.

Grapevine began by saying that someone had come
to him not so long ago with a bright idea. The idea
was good, they both agreed, so this somebody and he
wanted to put it to use. .

Well, Grapevine suggested using SFA, and the other
fellow held out for doing it himself. Now Grapevine is
pointing with pride because the other guy tried to do it
himself and had gotten into trouble. All the ‘trouble
could have been avoided if SFA had been given the idea
in the first place.

Grapevine Aids Downie

Imagine, we said, expecting SFA to do anything.
What have they ever done. This was Grapevine’s turn
to be shocked. “Wait,” he said, “You see what Downie
writes in his article in The News on the activities of
SFA.”

We started to list the things that Downie could write
about the student government’s actions during the last
semester.

First, they haven“: had a quorum many times dur-
ing the year. The last four times they met, as a matter
of fact, they had quorum trouble. Our opponent insist-
ed that the necessary number were there when any mo-
iions were passed.

Second, it had visited the Chancellor about the pub-
lications, building and athletic situation and made a re-
port that settled very little. But we admitted it was nice
to know what the Chancellor thought about these things.

Third, they had turned down a “no—corsage” policy.
Boy, what a scrap they had over that!

Fourth, they failed to reach a vote on the refugee
situation. As everybody knows this was due to quorum
trouble.

Fifth, ah, the crowning glory, they had succeeded in
having a theatre. This was the outcome of many years’
agitation for a newsreel theatre. Even Grapevine ad-
mitted it was due more to Mr. Biddle, and the commit-
tee, than to the SFA assembly.

Committees Make Reports

Sixth, there were several committee reports at vari-
ous times, indicating that some committees were doing
something. Grapevine was very hurt when someone
carelessly remarked that most of this was stooge work
anyhow.

Seventh, they had a traffic drive in conjunction with

accident lists ever published in the News appeared.

Eighth, they ﬁlled two vacant ofﬁces and changed the
rules to do it.

Ninth, they appointed the usual number of dance
chairmen.

Then there was a long silence. Grapevine looked
sheepish and tried to turn the conversation to whether
or not Fran Durkin was to be tapped Delt But we held
him to the point and he admitted that maybe SFA
wouldn’t have been such a good agency to get some-
thing done.

Which is something coming from. Grapevine, who
rarely ever backs down.

Title ‘Meet

By Joe Kristufek
At the conclusion of Coach Carl Olson ’s seventh Annual Indoor
Track Championships on Saturday, the general opinion was that John

had them sign contracts which ca

and Del Anderson ﬁnished in a dead
heat, while in the two mile run Al
Boulanger and Walt Sterner came in
together.

It was in the 440-yard dash that the
boys showed the best organizing spir-
it as Al Ferrara, Allan McKee, Larry
Tregonning, and Bud Graf crossed the
ﬁnishing line at the same time.

It remained for a junior and a
freshman to steal the show as Frank
Ohl, versatile all-around star, won
first place in the 50-yard dash, the
two lap dash, and the broad jump,

while Harold Stickel, handsome
freshman runner from McKees
Rocks, won the
blue ribbons in

the 50-yard dash,
the two lap dash,
and the 440-yard
dash.

I n cidentally,
Ohl’s time of 33
seconds for the
two lap dash set
a new University
indoor record for
that distance
while Stickel set
a new freshman
record in the two
lap dash at 33.9
seconds and tied
the old record of 5.5 seconds for the
50-yard dash.

McDowell Wins

As was expected, Johnny Bazyk,
junior star from New York, broke
the indoor shot-put record when
he heaved the 16 pound iron ball 47
feet, 101/2 inches. The old record was
46 feet, 4 inches. The freshmen kept
even with the varsity when Red Jes-
sup set up a new record for the
freshman pole vault at 12 feet.

Dave McDowell’s winning high
jump of 6 feet, 3/11 inches was sev-
eral inches short of Bennett’s rec-
ord holding jump of 6 feet, 4 inches
while Frank Kristl fell one tenth of
a second short of tieing Ryden’s 50-
yard low hurdling record of 6.0 sec-
onds.

Al Boulanger timed himself well
as he nosed out Sterner in. the one
mile run and tied him for ﬁrst place
in the two mile run.

Running according to predictions
was Joe Newman’s victory in the
50-yard high hurdles at 6.9 seconds
and George Clifton’s ﬁrst place in
the pole vault at 12 feet. The News
predicted all winners correctly with
the exception of the 440-yard dash,
the 880-yard run, and the two-mile

Other freshmen winners besides
Stickel were Red Jessup in the high
jump and the pole vault, Louis Man-
nual in the 880—yard and one mile
run, Powell in the 50-yard high hur-
dles, Cooper in the 50-yard low hur-
dles, and “Hoppy” Norton in the
broad jump. Blind Bill Kelly did ex-
ceptionally well in the high jump,
winning second place.

Title Race

Loss of 20 Points Would Put Phi Gains
In Third Place Behind Delts, Phi Delts

By Bert Jaifee

An explosion has landed right in
the midst of the Phi Gam quest for
the “All-Point” trophy.

According to the records of Inter-
fraternity Council, a match forfeited
cost the team forfeiting 20 points on
its point total; the Fijis have a for-
feit chalked against them in a ping-
pong match with Phi Kappa on Jan-
uary 4.

The latest point scoring, minus the
additional points added for winning a
championship, and not deducting 20
points for the above forfeited game
of the Fijis, show the Phi Gams in
the lead with 456 followed by Delta

‘Tau Delta and Phi Delta Theta with,

444 and 440.

Now, look at the scoring with the
forfeited game deducted from the
Fiji scoring. Delta Tau Delta rests
in ﬁrst place with 444, Phi Delta
Theta places second, and the Phi
Gams are third with 436. All the
other fraternities have at least one or
more forfeits counted against them
and are out of the running.

In the individual sports, the Phi
Kaps trounced Sigma Alpha Mu,
42-18, to replace Kappa Sigma as
basketball champions. The ﬁrst half
ended in a 10-10 deadlock due to the
long range shooting of Artie Hur-
wick of the SAM?s. Glenn flipped
nine buckets in the hoop to lead his
team in scoring.

Phi Gamma Delta broke the Phi
Delta Theta undefeated record in
volleyball by taking three straight
and clinching the championship. The
Phi Delts are in as second place
winners.

Phi Delta Theta and Phi Gamma
Delta tied for second in basketball
with 10 victories and two losses each.

Delta Tau Delta will receive addi-
tional points as winners of the ping-
pong championship. Phi Epsilon Pi
placed second followed by Pi Lambda
Phi.

A
A few matches in ping—pong, vol-

leyball, and bowling have not been
played but this will not alter the
scoring of the three leaders.

Theta Chi repeated its win in
bowling. Daddio and company won
all but one match and the majority of
their victories were via the shutout
routine.

All championships have been de-
cided in the trophy race except schol-
arship and the annual indoor track
meet, which is to be held tomorrow
night.

The Big Three, with Kappa Sigma,
will be in the running for the track
championship. Kappa Sigma is the
defending champion, but the all-
round strength of the Phi Gams and
Phi Delts should push the defending
champ and the Delts into the back-
ground.

Thurbon, Pressell, Edmunds, R.
Dimit, and Wells will bear watching
under the Fiji colors, and Stebbins,
Fleming, Cashdollar, Larry Smith,
and Dickinson carry the Phi Delt
hopes in track.

Included in the meet will be the
high jump, broad jump, hop—step-
and-jump, shot put, medley relay,
200 yard shuttle relay, and the eight
lap relay.

One of the featured attractions will
be the shot put duel between foot-
ballers Larry Peace and Ted Konet-
sky. Larry paced “T. K.” in the in-
doors a year ago, but Ted reversed
the decision in the outdoor meet.

Lambda Chi Alpha was the winner
of the fraternity handball league. The
Lambda Chi’s went undefeated in
ifour matches, winning all 12 games
‘they played. Phi Gamma Delta
‘placed second, winning all its matches

except the three against the winners.
l However, handball has no effect on
the “All Point” trophy as the Inter-
,fraternity Council voted not to count
n this earlier in the year.

odified

By Leonard Levison
Sports Editor
Pitt and the VVest'ern Conference, ostensibly wedging closer a11d
closer, were given another point of mutuality when it was annou11c-
ed this morning that a three-gaine football contract had been no-
gotiated between the Panthers and the University of Minnesota to

become effective in 19-11 and to ext
nouncement came from the Gopher

 

end through ’42 and ’-13. The an-
athletic offices in Minneapolis.

First game in this reviviﬁed series"*ev

will be played in Minneapolis on Oc-
tober 18, 1941. The second will also
be in the Big Ten school’s home sta-
dium. Its date has been set for Sep-
tember 26, 1942. Pitt Stadium will
be the site of the ’43 game for which
no Saturday date has yet been made.

Meetings between Pitt and Bernie
Bierman’s Gophers are not an in-
novation of the present era of Pan-
ther- Big Ten “good feeling.” When
both were in the top ranks, the two
teams engaged in a home and home
series in 1933 and 1934. Minnesota,
the present outstanding power in
Western Conference football, won
both games.

Gophers Win

Playing in Minneapolis in ’33, the
Gophers, led by All-American Fran-
cis “Pug” Lund wiggled out a 7-3
victory. Statistics of the game fav-
ored the Panthers, but the frigid
western weather helped contribute
to the Pitt defeat. Mike Sebastian,
great running Pitt right half-back,
had a notorious afternoon of punt
fumbling, which occasionally rise up
to plague Pitt righ-haltfbacks.

In 1934 the two teams tangled be-
fore a full Pitt stadium on a sun-
shiney October afternoon in a game
that decided the national gridiron
championship of that year. Scoring
all of their points in the ﬁnal quar-
ter, Minnesota came out on top with
a 13-7 victory.

It was a heart-breaking loss for
that team of Panthers and it was the
only game they did lose. Considered
by many as one of the greatest teams
in Pitt history, it was composed of
such greats as Hartwig. Ormiston,
Shotwell, Munjas, and Vtfeinstock.
Minnesota had Pug Lund back and
that bruising full-back, Stan Kostka.

year. The game is remembered as
one of the best ever to be played in
the Stadium.

A Pitt-‘Vﬁnnesota series, coming on
the heels of the recent Pitt unofficial
alliance with the Major Griffith of-
ﬁce, is nonetheless not the ﬁrst Pan-
ther-Western Conference relations.
During the past decade Pitt has been
on the schedule of a Big Ten team al-
most every year. Four games were
played with Ohio State, two with
Wisconsin, and the two a1ready-men-
tioned contests with the Gophers.

Opening Game

Opening with Minnesota in ’4.2
will be a far cry from the ﬁrst games
with such teams as Waynesburg, Ohio
Wesleyan, and W&J that have pre-
viously been an inaugural dish for
the Panthers. Minnesota is accus-
tomed to having such severe tests the
first game out, having played Nebra-
ska and Washington in the past few
years.

It falls in line with the new Pitt
policy of no warm-up games. But
it is an apparent contradiction to
the policy point which had the open-
ing game listed the ﬁrst week in Oc-
tober instead of the last week in
September. This provision had been
made because the “Code Bowman”
has set the opening date as Septem-
ber 10. This means that the Pan-
thers in ’4-2 will have only two weeks
to prepare for Minnesota.

Equality Questioned

By 1941, when the ﬁrst game will
be played, Pitt will have a team of
completely “Code Bowmanized”
players. There is no indication of any
change in the Minnesota production
of super-teams. Campus opinion,
strongly welcoming a meeting with
the Gophers, was wondering whether
or not the game would be as signiﬁc-
ant and as evenly-matched as the
previous series, since the oncoming,
generation of Pitt “codiﬁed” teams
appear to be no man-power match
for the best football teams in the
country.

Chi Alpha and Delta Tau Delta, fra-
ternity handball and table tennis
winners, undisputed title holders.

Volleyball and basketball playoffs
begin today while the bowlers begin
competition tomorrow. No volleyball
team has been entered by the Engi-
neers nor are the Independents rep-
resented in bowling. Only basket-
ball will be run under the double
elimination scheme, the other sports
being on the two-best-out-of-three
basis.

Newman Club and Phi Gamma
Delta open volley ball hostilities at 4
o’clock this afternoon at Trees Gym.
A second game is scheduled for 4
o’clock Wednesday, and the third
match, if necessary, will take place
at 4 o’clock on Thursday.

The fraternity’ bowling champs,
undetermined at this writing, meet
the leading engineers at 4 o’clock to-
morrow afternoon, then continue the
scrap at 8 o’clock Wednesday. A
possible third clash would be slated
for 8 o’clock on Thursday.

Easily the most popular sport will
be basketball with all leagues com-
peting. Phi Kappa, king pin club of
the fraternity loop, goes into its
match at 7 o’clock this evening a
slight favorite over the Oil and Gas
outﬁt, unbeaten Engineer champs.

The Phi Kaps, with Glenn, _Hollor-
an, and Cassiano usually in starring
roles, swept through their league sea-
son with just one defeat, an upset
trimming at the hands of Phi Delta
Theta. Combining a well balanced
attack with a steady defense, the
Craig Street ﬁve has had the stuff to
take the close ones as well as the set-
ups.

Oil and Gas rolled up win after
win to become the only undefeated
quintet in the three leagues. Croker
topped the Oilers’ scoring parade
throughout the year and should give
the Phi Kaps a busy night.

Either Newman Club or the Pitt
Club will oppose the Phi Kap con-
tingent at 7 o’clock on Wednesday.
Tied with one defeat each at the end

‘ﬁts have met twice in a best out of

of the regular season, the two out-

three playoff with each ﬁve taking
one game.

The loser of Wednesday’s conﬂict
will be paired with the loser of to-
day’s game at 7 o’clock on Thursday
while the ﬁnale, involving the win-
ners of Wednesday’s and Thursday’s
matches, is slated for 4 o’clock Fri-
day.

The Newmans turned in a hair
breadth 46-44 win over Pitt'Club in
the ﬁrst playoff, then collapsed last
Friday as the P_itt club boys took a
big lead and held on to emerge 41-36
victors. The Newmans had 15-13 lead
at the half but faded in the stretch.

Joe Kristufek, Newman ace, paced
the scorers with seven ﬁeld goals
while the Pitt Club’s Tratar dropper
in ﬁve double deckers and three
fouls. Bill Ruskin, also Club, ﬂipped
in six loopers, and Frank Kristufek
clicked with four buckets and a brace
of fouls.

Pitt Pucksters
To lweet Tech

Determined to go through the rest
of the season unbeaten and regain at
least a part of their prestige, the Pitt
icers test their new policy on two foes
this week.

Both opponents should be just what
the Panthers need to keep them in a
winning spirit. The boys from across
the hollow, Tech, are the victims to-
morrow night, while ﬂoundering
Baldwin-Wallace will try to keep the
Pitt score down on Saturday evening.

The Tartans have done none too
well in recent weeks. Even their
usually dependable goalie, Fred
Fieler, has begun to crack under the
strain of a pitiful defense and has
been letting so-so shots get into the
cage.

Pete Schilwaski, he of the high-

powered vocal chords, is the lone,
bright spot in the Skibo line and de- 
fense combinations. When and if

Tech scores, Pete will probably do
the goal-getting. I

The rest of the Tech starting com- i
bine will consist of center Barker,5
Renner on the other wing, and Wilson ;
and Ely on defense. Wrecked by in-
eligibility, the sub list has been re-.
duced to Buchanan, Herrie, Block,§
and the inexperienced Church.

Cuts Ranks

Eligibility notices, posted on the
27th ﬂoor bulletin board of the
athletic office last week, were made
most conspicuous by the absence of
certain prominent athletic names.

With approximately thirty names
missing, the greater proportion of ab-
sentees were among the freshman
ranks. This \vas directly attributed
to the freshman athletic problem
which raged during an important
scholastic part of last semester.

Not allowed registration privileges
were Bill Dutton, sensational right
halfback, Evan Laughlin and Lou
LaMark. They are, accordingly, not
in school this semester. Varsity foot-
ball players out of spring practice
were Larry Peace and Jack Good-
ridge, both of whom ﬁgure strongly
in next season’s plans. Two junior
varsity trackmen, Coggswell and
Nurmi, were also eliminated from
competition.

Hardest blow is struck to football,
where the all-important spring ses-
sion is greatly hampered. Fullback,
right halfback and end loom as ser-
ious problems. Daddio and Hoffman
graduated and of their four poten-
tial successors, three are ineligible.
They are Goodridge and freshmen
Gregg an-d Gervalis. Peace and Dut-
ton were the outstanding right-half-
back candidates. Fullback candi-
dates who need the drilling are Ross
and Connell, both freshmen and both
ineligible.

Lion iioopsters

heat Pitt, 3633

State College, Pa.—In as thrilling

a game as has been plaped in Recrea- '

tion Hall all year, the Penn State
Lions “deliberately” sent the Pan-
thers into “reverse” for their second
victory of the year over the Pitts-
burgh team Saturday evening, 36-35.

After leading all of the way, John-
ny Lawther’s deliberators were al-
most overcome by an intense Pitt
rally in the game’s closing points.
Dr. Carlson’s reverse offense went
into gear, but the Lions held onto
the ball and in that way came out
with the victory. This game com-
pletely eliminated the Panthers from
any ranking place in the Conference
standings.

Pitt trailed, 21-27, at the half, and,
31-27, in the middle of the last pe-
riod. Ed-die Straloski, expert Pitt
shotmaker, rolled up 12 more points
to pace the scoring while Max Cor-
bin, State guard came through with
ten tallies. -
