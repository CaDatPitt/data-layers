tude/that year. :f ’ » '

The Lions were 6-2 when they came here and were

' tied, 7-7. When Pitt drew the bowl bid, State Coach Rip
Engle accused Tom Hamilton, who was "athletic director
here then, of political wrangling.

1 ‘ . Caused a Furor 4 -
V There was furor in University Park again in 1958
when the Lions were 6-3-1, and went nowhere. f

This year’s game is also the last opportunity the
seniors on this year’s Pitt club have to beat State. EK-
cept for their frosh year, they’ve never done it.

For nine members of the startingteam it will be
their ﬁnal appearance at the Stadium. The only regu-

lars returning next year are quarterback Fred Mazurek
and halfback Bill Bodle. ‘

The other two members of the backﬁeld unit, Rick I

Leeson and Paul Martha, would like nothing more than
to beat State. J

“I love to beat Notre Dame and teams like that,” says

Martha, “but you have to live with those guys from State.

It. gets tiresome having them hold it over your head all
the time.” ' . _

Leeson’s thinking runs parallel to Martha’s. “It’s‘
about ‘time people in this town looked to Pitt for foot-

Joe Kuzneski Pm ves Ability
 After Long T erhi On Bench

By BOB SMIZIK

, A year ago Joe Kuzneski’s chief claim
to fame was his brother Andy, starting
center and ‘captain of the 1962 Panther
football team. Tomorrow when Kuzneski
takes the ﬁeld against Penn State the
Lions won’t be thinking of him as Andy’s
brother, but as a potent offensive threat
and a tough‘ defensive end.

 

Penn State Determines
Panthers’ Future Plans 

By ART FLEISCHNER

Tomorrow’s Pitt-Penn State game means as much to the
Panthers as Harvard does to Yale or Navy does to Army.
Not only is Penn State Pitt’s biggest rival, but they also are 
in a position to determine whether the Panthers play a ten  ‘{-
or e,’ even game scheduleothis year. t

A loss to the Nittany Lions could knock the Panthers
out of a bowl and put the charges of Rip Engle into one for
the ﬁfth year in a row. The pic- I -
ture is clouded further by the fact

‘Predicts Panther Win

won’t be as easy to move in the
line as Army was. State is much
bigger. They’re harder to move.
If we can move them, we’ll beat
them..If not, we’ll have to throw.”
Whether the Panthers have to
passor run, Ware is as conﬁdent
of a'Panther victory as a hen
is of hatching an egg. “We’ll
have to tighten up our pass de-
fense _for State, and it will be
one of our toughest games of
the season. But,” Ware added,
“we will definitely win.” .
The Nittany Lions have ‘been
overlooked by the bowl commit-

  ll'OI‘|ail: Responsibilities

During the past week, rumors have been circulating around
campus concerning an alleged violation of conduct on the part of a
A student organization. The Pitt News learned, from various sources,
that many students were afraid that the paper would splash the story
i all over page one of last Wednesday’s issue in as scandalous a manner
. as possible, because The Pitt News is “out to get” certain student groups.
P I They objected to this on the grounds that The Pitt News should help
‘keep the nose of the University and its organizations as clean as possible.

 A Newspaper

If a story ‘does not appear in the paper, it is only because there
is no story to appear or because we could not get the story. We are
not in business to keep unpleasant news from the University community;
rather, our job is to report such occurances in as objective a manner

— as possible.

The Pitt News  not a charitable organization striving to promote
organizations or events. The paper has an obligation to report upcoming

events, but it has no obligation to continually advertise certain functions f

at the expense of others of equal importance.

The Pitt News is, moreover, not “out to get” certain organizations’
on campus; however,-should any organization step out of line in such a
manner as to become news, then it is our obligation to report this in the

paper. To report the facts is not a deﬁnition of scandal sheet, but it is A

the deﬁnition of newspaper. It is only when the facts are blown up all

’,out‘ of proportion to their worth that we become liable to criticism.

The Pitt News is in a ticklish"positionbecausetit is run by people

‘who: are also students at this institution.’ This would seem to confront

us/with. conﬂicting obligations; however, if a‘ newspaper ‘is going to
be published atthe University then it must be a newspaper and not an
institutional house organ. Upon this responsibility, we take our stand.

The establishment of
communications is import-
ant, especially among stu-
dents of different cultural

V backgrounds. The brother-

sister committee sponsored

I by the International Stu- "

dents Committee attempts
to achieve this objective.

V ' Thus the objectivesiof the
‘A ‘program are good; the pro-
C gram itself is workable. It
~ is not yet, however, doing _
hall that it is meant to do. i

There are some bugs that

i need to be worked out; yet
_ - they are bugs, and not ele-
" phants as some critics of
 the program would have
T the students believe. There

‘is the need for an insecti-

» cide and not for setting up

elephant traps —— insecti-

cide strong enough to kill ’

that which is preventing
the brother-sister program
-from achieving the goal it

A has set for itself.

,Many problems arise
because the participants

of the program are not .

quite prepared for such a

I V program. They are either

confused about its goals

or do not have the proper ‘

‘outlook towards it. Such
people are, I think, in the
minority but, like the
Peace Corps volunteer

Miss Michaelmore and
her post card incident,

they turn attention of the
people away from the
successful volunteers. The
lapse occurs both ‘on the

part of American and the ‘

foreign V students.

One co-ed, for example,-

said to me the other day
that her brother seems to
think of her as a ready date.

She arrived’ at this conclu-,

sion because he asked her
to go places with him. Hav-
ing formed an opinion, per-

haps justiﬁed, she inter-

preted every action of her
brother from a, new per-
spective. For her and her
brother any valuable ex-
‘ ideas seems
highly .improbable. _
There is also lack of mo-
tivation in the participants.

*Mo‘st foreign students in

the program are, in "gradu-
ate school, while their
American counterparts are
undergraduate. ,As such,
there is an unbalanced re-
lationship due to the fact
that several American stu-
dents embark upon the
project not fora cultural
exchange, but with a View

of helping a confused per-

son who does not know
what to do in a strange
country, Despite the re-
moval of the tag “big” from
brother-sister program, the
emphasis remains the same.

The ratio of men to
women is often a cause of
unnecessary f r i c t io n.

Ninety percent’ of the
foreign students in the
program are male, while
ninety per cent of the

American students in the . P

program are female. As’
such, a, frank and close

, relationship is often diffi-
‘ cult and if

achieved
causes problems.

, This is especially so in‘
light of the general outlook.

on the part of the Univer-
sity ‘community w hich
tends to misconstrue such a
relationship. ‘Contrary to

common belief such mis- .
understanding stems from

the students ' themselves
rather than from the more
mature members of the fac-
ulty and administration. A
co-ed conﬁded in me that
she is afraid to be seen too
much with her brother for
fear that such practice may
result

boys who conclude that she

Several '_ students who
signed up for the_ program
with good intentions ﬁnd
that they do not have all
the time that the job de-
mands. Their activities and
school work occupy most

of their time. Thus they’

feel guilty about not dis-

charging their responsibil-'

ity and in order to avoid
this feeling they try to
totally avoid their brother
or sister. '

This could be best done
by holding special sessions
with both? the American
and foreign students, sepa-

rately and together, ac-,
quainting them with and 5

impressing upon them the
true objectives of the pro-
gram. Perhapsva committee

and advice. 7
An intense search must
be made for more Ameri-
can male students who
would be interested in the
program. This may perhaps
require the need of “sell-
ing’’ the program to the

who, once they realized the
value of the program,
would be most enthusias-

Including the brother or

absorb most of their time
would solve the problem of
not ﬁnding enough time for
him or her. If both were in

mutual interests might also
cement the gap that may

in a planned series featuring

versity. It has been compiled
and written by Pat Pollino.
These special sections are de-
signed to give students an add-

derstaffed, acknowledges the in-
/corporation of journalism into the
‘liberalized category of creative
writing, and believes the Univer-
sity’s literature program “can hold
up well with any other offered
in the country.” .

Dr. Crouch explained’ that with
the retirement of Prof. Emily Ir-
vine (who formerly taught Ad-
vanced Expository Writing), and
Prof. Edwin , Peterson’s working
on a widely-publicized . overhead
slide project for freshmen courses,
'the bulk of the writing load has
fallen upon Dr. Montgomery Cul-
ver._

“We have been looking around
the past year for really good peo-
ple in writing to teach,” said Dr.
Crouch. “It is extremely difficult
to get the kind of competent peo-
ple we want for advanced courses

in writin .”
..,_,_/ 8

Nationwide Signiﬁcance

He added that the problem is
one of nationwide signiﬁcance.
According to Dr. Crouch, there is
an apparent abundance of litera-
ture instructors, but not enough
writing instructors. The Univer-
sity, he said, is looking for an
individual who himself has pro-
ven his ability not only to teach,
but also to write —- i.e., one who

‘has been published.

1/‘.
X

“We hope to have one —-
possibly two — new men as
writing instructors. next fall,”
said Dr. Crouch. “We would
like to_ get a .Ph. D. who has‘
published.” .

An attempt is being made to
schedule a short story course
every term and a’ “good, sound
course in Advanced Expository

.{-'’Writing,’’ acording-to Dr. Crouch.

Writing the Short Story is‘ not

 being offered in the daytime cur-
'- riculum this fall, but it will be of-

fered the winter term. Advanced

Expository Writing is now being
taught by a part-time instructor,
Dr. Crouch noted.

Stresses Technical Writing
A specialized area that deserves
more emphasis, in the opinion
of Dr. Crouch, is technical writ-
ing.

“We need help in this area,
and we have our eyes on a man
right now,” he said. However,
he added that a question mark
exists in technical writing be-
ing offered the winter term. .

Dr. Crouch declared that tech-
nical writing is a ﬁeld of which
the English major is unfortunately
unaware.

‘Snap’ Courses

‘fLibera1 Arts students —-— and
it is especially true of English
majors,” he said, “don’t do any-
thing signiﬁcant in the sciences.
"They look around f o r ‘snap’
courses in natural sciences, by-
passing the «difficult one for easier‘
courses.

“I feel a good ‘ many people
need technical writing, and the
possibility of conducting a sci-
ence writing program as a nec-
essary * part of the curriculum
is now under discussion.”

On the matter of journalism,
Dr. Crouch explained that ‘ the
University decided two years ago
to eliminate specialized journal-

tive writing.

Duplication of Effort‘

“We felt there was a good deal
of duplication of effort in many
journalism courses,” he said.

Most newspapers prefer to
train people in reporting and
editing — the “bread and but-
ter” courses offered under a
journalism curriculum, acord-
ing to Dr. Crouch. Under the
University’s plan, a student can
go to graduate seho_ol.;f.0r spec-

. ialized journalism courses.

“It is trend everywherethat
courses . dealing speciﬁcally with
business subjects —-— journalism
being. "in. that category —-— ought
to _be reserved for graduate
school,” Dr.“ Crouch said.

Irving Rothman, director of
student publications, taught the
seminar in Mrs. Bernhard’s ab-
sence last year. When, asked
what he thought of the Uni-
versity’s elimination of special-
ized journalism courses, he,
commented:

“It wasn’t a strong program to
begin with._ The department was
faced with a choice of either ex-
panding and improving it, or of
dispensing with it completely. I
don’t think the latter has hurt the
students any.”

More Courses

Dr. Crouch singled out Writ-
ing- the Article, also taught by
Mrs. Bernhard, as an example of
a journalism course that has been
incorporated into creative Writ-
ing. He added that with the addi-
tion of one or two new- writing

instructors next ‘fall, the possi-j

bility of one or two more quasi-
journalism classes is likely to be
enhanced.

A feeling of pride could be
detected when Dr. Crouch be-
gan speaking of the literature
segment'of the English Depart-
ment faculty and courses of-
fered in the literature program.

“We’ve decided that a student
in a serious study of literature
should take a group of core
courses,” said Dr. Crouch, “to
give him an overall view of the
development of En glish and.
American literature.” -

 

Six Core Courses

The core courses’ mentioned by
Dr. Crouch being six in
number — are .Medieval Litera-
ture, Early English Masterpieces,
Renaissance (1500 - 1660), N e w
Classicism (I660 - 1800), Nin e -
teenth Century Literature "and
Major American Writers.

“The core courses make an‘
excellent group on which a stu-
dent can buil ,” said Dr.
Crouch. “He can then go on to
more specilaized courses."

He explained there are two
more requisite courses for stu-
dents in Education Shake-

{l’_age/£> —‘-“THE   -'- Friday; November 22.‘ 1963

There are many students who
are unaware that all of the so-
called nationality rooms are not
on the ﬁrst floor. of the Cathedral;
that there is one on the third ﬂoor.

The -misplaced room, call it
what you will,’ is the Early Amer-

-ican Room (328), and, is the office
. of writing Prof. Edwin Peterson of

the English Department.

Finished in April, 1938, a gift of
George Hubbard Clapp, the Early

T — American Room has become a

stomping ground for University
mentor groups. The room recalls

— the character built into New Eng-

land homes about 1650.

Recalls’ Incident
Prof. Peterson recalls how he

‘came upon securing the room as

an office.

‘fYears ago, when I used to
teach short story classes in
here,” he related, “Dean (Stan-
ton) Crawford called me and
asked me if I would be willing
to use it temporarily as my
office, for the room I was using
at the time for’ an office was

' needed.

. (‘The new administration appa-
rently forgot about it,” and, he
added with a chuckle, “I wasn’t
then —- and am not now — sorry

’ that they did.”

'Air Force Occupancy

"Peterson explained that he had
to give up the room for a brief

time during World War II, when

the Air Force took over the whole
third floor. It is reported that

three boys lived AWOL in the‘

room for a week during that time.

‘Depicting an early New Eng-
«land kitchen-living room, the
low-ceilinged chamber contains
a long pine table (which looks

,like a picnic table)‘ with benches
on either side in the middle of
the ﬂoor, a small round table
with high-backed wooden chairs I
(and overhanging bookcase) on

I the left, and a ﬁreplace on the

right.

_ Hung from‘ iron cranes within:
the ﬁreplace, or on the hearth,

are various, utensils, such as a
long-handled shovel and paddles
for baking, iron cooking pots, a
spider, a gridiron, a trivet, a long-
handled waffle iron, cooking forks
and ladles. ‘

Swinging Arm

A long, slender wooden arm
swings out from the wall on a
pivot above the ﬁreplace. Mentor
groups are usually told this de-
vice was used for drying blankets
or some such thing. Prof. Peter-
son noted another use for the
wooden arm.

“They were probably used to
some extent for ‘bundling’,” he
‘said.’ A deﬁnition of ‘bundling’
would be one’s going to bed
with a member of the opposite
sex (especially a sweetheart)-—
without undressing. _

“A sheet would be placed on
the wooden arm,”, said Peterson,
“and the lovers would be shield-
ed from the rest of the room.”

Bricks Handmade

- A bake-oven is located at the
back of the ﬁreplace. The bricks
have all been handmade.

Just to the left of the ﬁre-
place is a long, narrow door in
the wood paneling. The door
opens ’ into what seems at ﬁrst
to be a I cupboard with _a solid

. brick wall to the right. Peter-

son stepped inside the cup-

subsidiaries. He will be able to
obtain practical business experi-
ence to supplement his classroom
work. 1 .

This cigarette and tobacco ﬁrm
was the first in the industry to
support -college-level education‘ by

a knothole in the wall and a light
came on, showing a path up the
stairway. At the top_ of the stair-
way was a secret loft.

Highly Impracticle «

“We used this for awhile as a
conference room,” said Peterson.
“However, it’s highly impracticle,

Simplicity and Sincerity

Peterson, “are after all the marks,

course, does not include modern

British-Born Mellon Professor

 

 Noted Shakespeari an Authority

The English Department’s Andrew Mellon Professor, Dr. John Ramsay Allardyce
Nicoll, has a list of intellectual credits which reads like his name — long.

The balding, 69-year-old professor with an unmistakeable accent has certainly
proven by his record that he is, as Dr. W. George Crouch claims, an ‘international authority
on the theater and “one of the best scholars on Shakespeare in the English-speaking world.”

To the encouraging professional pat on the back, Dr. Nicoll replied quite modestly,
“It was very kind of someone to say that aboutme.”

Native of Scotland
A native of Scotland, Dr. Nicoll
was educated at Glasgow Univer-
Sity Where he was graduated with

"1" an M.A. He was awarded honor-

L./'

   

. 400th anniversary of the immortal

ary doctorates at two French in-
stitutions of learning, Montpellier
and Toulouse.

“In England,” explained Dr.
Nicoll, “the necessity of having
a Ph.D. is not as great as in:
the United States.”

Dr. Nico1l’s teaching career be-
gan in England and eventually
took him across the Atlantic to
the States. , ‘

Lecturer in English

He began as a lecturer in En-
glish at Loughborough College;
moved on to lecture in English
at Kings College of the Univer-
sity of London,_ and became pro-
fessor of English Language and
Literature at Queen Mary’s Col-
lege of the University of London
before crossing the ocean,

In 1933, Dr. Nicoll was named
chairman of the department of
drama and director of theater at
Yale University, succeeding the
famed Sir George Pierce" Baker.
Yale granted Dr. Nicoll a leave
of absence at the -outset of
World War II, and he became
attache at tle British Embassy
in Washington,. D.C., during the
war. -

When the war had ceased, Dr.
Nicoll found himself on native
soil once again. He was ‘appointed
‘professor of English at the Uni-
versity of Birmingham (England)
in 1945, and also assumed director-
ship of the Shakespeare Institute,
Stratford-on—Avon. As an Andrew
Mellon Professor, he is presently.
on leave from both positions.

Continuous Study

His study of Shakespeare is a’

continuous one.

“I intend to be editing up to
1965 an annual volume, Shake-
speare’s Survey, Dr. Nicoll
noted.

The 1964 volume, according to
Dr. Nicoll, will be a special one,
since it will commemorate the

Shakespeare’s birth. It will be the
17th volume in the series.

Editorial Column

By _ Pat Pollino

  

The English Department is blessed (if you care to speak re-
ligiously) with a number of excellent instructors. Able to devote
their undivided attention to teaching, the instructors can most effec-
tively display their wares. '

But when they are manipulated by higher-‘ups, so that they
can no longer industriously attend to the task of _instruction — in
fact, instructing per se has taken on a subsidiary aura —— then it’s
time to clean the bifocals and re-examine clauses of contracts.

For instance, one instructor (who shall remain anonymous)
had occasion to tell this reporter recently that he has been
asked by-higher-ups to take so many trips — make so many
guest appearances outside the University — which take_up so’
much time that the wonders, “How am I expected to teach?”- ~

He went on to explain that continual meetings, memo exchang-
es and production pressure have applied the skids to mental atten-
tiveness. Or more simply, he’s plumb played out. ‘

“Maybe I’m just getting old,” he postulates.

Maybe he is just trying to rationalize for something that
isn't of his own volition, but takes its toll nonetheless and be- "
comes, evident tostudents in his classes. Is this the kind of in- A
struction the University prides itself in?

cessant manipulations of its faculty to the point of stunting teach-
ing capacities of the individual?

Then, too, there are those instructors who accept offers requiring
their attention from outside interests, with little or no prodding

but (please!) let’s not have it consistently at the expense of Uni-
versity students. _ - .
The English Department does not stand alone in this matter,
under any stretch of the imagination.
Students must shell out $33 per credit (nixing University fees)

. in order to attend classes at the University. They at least have the

‘right to expect /a $33-per-credit-worth education. .
This can be achieved, we believe, ‘if, instead of dispatching
faculty personnel to_a myriad of literature and writing symposiums,
the instructors are put back in the classrooms -- where they belong.
After all, an instructor's primary obligation is teaching; all
else, including public relations for the University, should be sec-
ondary. ' I

Penn State Tops Booters, 4-2

The soccer team dropped its last
game of the season to Penn State,
4-2. Tuesday at University Park.
The team wound up the season
with a 5-5 record. After the third
goal was scored by the Nittanies,
goalie Tom Staab lost any chance
he had had to set the all-time
Panther goals—a1lowed-per-game
average.

Center forward George Shim-
peno scored twice for the losers.
Shimpeno and outside left Dave
Reichenbach ﬁnished the season
as top scorers with eight goals
each. ‘Shimpeno now has a college
total of 16 goals and Reichenbach
14.

Coach Leo Bemis was not satis-
ﬁed with the way his team play-
ed in the ﬁrst half, but he highly

praised the Penn State team.
“They were one of the best
teams we’ve played,” he said.
“They played a very ﬁne short
pass game and had very good
ball-handling. They were prob.
ably the best passing team we
faced all year. The two students
from Iraq on their team had

surprising speed.”

The Panthers were only able to
win one game away from home
this season, against West Virginia.
Bemis expects the schedule next
year to be the same, with the ex-
ception of Bucknell replacing
Lock Haven.

Penn State now holds a com-
manding 6-3 edge in the all-time
series.
