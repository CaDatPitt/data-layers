. Suspect Charged in Sat.



MONDAY,‘ OCTOBER 29, 1973

BY RICHARD SWARTZ

Campus police pursued and
apprehended a rape suspect on
Thackeray Street Saturday moi’ning
moments after the suspect alleg-
edly attacked a 22-year old nurse
on O'Hara Street in the loading

dock of old Engineering Hall.
University - police reported the
suspect was captured within five
minutes after they received the
call. He was booked Saturday
evening on charges of rape,
aggravated assault, and resisting
arrest. The victim was taken to a

nearby hospital for treatment.
Patrolman Donald Dorsey said he
arrived at the scene at,7:l4 a.m..

one minute after theicall came-

through. The woman's screams
had alerted a worker on the sixth
floor of the hall. who notified
police. According to Dorsey, the
suspect-fled on foot down Univer-
sity Place when Dorsey's car pulled

” into the driveway.

“It was my duty to remain with
the victim,” Dorsey said. “I fired a
warning round, but the suspect
didn’t stop. He turned the corner
on University Place and.ran down
the Social Science Building walk-
way to Thackeray Street. He tried
to hide under a vehicle,’ but
Officers Foster and Zaborowski
spotted him.”

Dorsey said the attacker appar-
ently dragged the victim off the
street while she was walking to
work. T

“Articles from her purse [were
strewn over the sidewalk. and the
suspect had stripped her from the
waist down by the time I arrived."
he added. Police later learned the
suspect is a Detroit native. "who
said he was visiting friends in Pitts-
burgh.

This latest incident is an

unwelcome addition to the five
reports of attempted rape that
occured on campus grounds last

summer. One media source
reported there have been two
dozen attempted rapes in the

Oakland district over the past two
years. Oakland ranks fifth among
the city's nine districts in reported
rapes. _ “

Police statistics reveal Pittsburgh
had 298 rapes in 1972, an increase
of 21%/‘over 1970. Joseph Gil,
director of the University’s Health
and Safety Division, expressed
uncertainty over whether increased
motor patrols could ’ offset the
alarming rise. .

"You have to realize thcsetkind of

crimes do not take-place in front of

policeinen." Gil said. "In crimes
against other people. the offender
has a distinct advantage ove_r the
police. Both he and his victim are
mobile. so that if a guy on the

Pitt Psychologist Wins Research Award

A $7500 award from the National

logist for research on early learning

/Viazzei, Bromley Named

 To Board of Trustees 

6'

State Senator Frank Mazzci, D -
South Side. and Bradford‘ L_usi--
nessman Robert Bromley have
been named to Pitt's Board of
Trustees.

Mazzei was appointed by Penn'-
sylvania Senate Pro Tempore
Martin L. Murray. The Senator
will be one of four Commonwealth
Trustees serving a four year term.

Bromley. appointed by
Speaker Kenneth Leeyis a member
of the advisory committee for the
Bradford Campus. He is also
secretary of the Bradford Era
newspaper and is involved in the
insurance business. I

The Board of Trustees is
composed of 36 members. Along
gwith the -I2 ,Commonwealth

House '

trustees are '18 charter members
who serve until age 65. Another-six
are term trustees who can serve
two consecutive four year terms
and are elected by the Board at
large.

The remaining six members are
alumnae recommended by the
Alumnae Association and then
elected by the Board.

The 12 Commonwealth trustees
resulted from Pitt's change to a

state-related institution. Every

agreement of the Senate. the

street is looking for a victim. he can
wait until she is out of view before
attacking."

Gil credited Saturday's victim
with screaming once she had been
attacked. "She followed her
natural instincts. which is what
victims sooften fail to do. Either

that. orshe followed some kind of

previous counseling.”

He said the two most effective
lines of defense against rape are a
more extensive lighting system and
a more thorough orientation of
campus women regarding anti-rape
measures. As for closed circuit
television within buildings them-
selves, Gil said there are numerous
disadvantages as well as advan-
tages. '

“Television. when properly used,
can have a security application. but
I'm not _sure it's a standout‘for
defensive purposes." Gil said.

“We . are trying to develop
procedures to help children plan

their learning environment and

blems,” she said. “In our
technological society, we have
achieved moreleisure time. We
must learn to use this time
meaningfully, and we must’ teach

our children how‘ to skillfully plan,

The psychologist said that skill in.

decision-making is essential to
making efficient use of leisure
time. 
"The decision-making skill
needs to-be developed systema-
tically.” she noted.‘
Wang asserted that there are
many things psychologists do not
know about young children.
“The first thing I do is watch the
kids and see how they operate. I
like to speak with children, and
thus see the difference between

Then. according to Wang,
“intervention strategies’? are
developed which include _educa-
tional programs and equipment to
stimulate the child's learning
growth.

“Our general aim,” she said, “is
for children to come to ‘school and
have some idea of what they want
to do for the day, and to plan
specifically. Then at the end of the

. day, we want the children to have

the ability to assess how realistic
were the goals they set for
themselves. We want to develop

Rape ‘Tapes Only First Step,   

Ex-prosecutor Cox Says

WASHINGTON.AP--Former
Watergate special prosecutor
Archibald Cox said Sunday the
presidential tape recordings over
which he was fired “were clearly
only a first step in seeking a grea
deal of imporant evidence from the
White House."

Cox said that as part of an
investigation of campaign contri-
butions he would have sought
accounts of a meeting between
President Nixon and former Agri-
culture secretary Clifford A».
Hardin which dealt ’ with milk
pricing.

The White House has refused to
makesuch material available in
connection with a civil court suit
questioning a milk price hike
granted by Hardin soon after dairy

Wang said this does not mean
that teachers will eventually be
done away with. But teachers "will
function more as instructional
guides.‘ and students will have
some control over their learning.

Recently, Wang did an
experiment in a classroom of
four-year-olds which brought star-
tling results. Trying to solvea
classroom management problem.
she stumbled upon what may be a
key to learning motivation.

“The original class schedule
called for a one hour prescriptive
curriculum requiring the student to
learn specific tasks. and a one hour
exiploratoryvlearning time where
the children could select anything
they wanted to learn such as
reading a book, doing artwork, or
playing with blocks," she ex-
plained. _“A problem arose during
the prescriptive period when all the
students seemed to need the
teacher at once. Consequently,
students got bored waiting for the
teacher and there arose disruptive
behavior.

“We asked why do all
children have to be doing the same
thing at the same time. So we
developed a different program
where the only contingency was
that the students had to finish the
prescribed tasks, but in any order.
So, the teacher was not needed by
everyone at once.” i

' .

The results were amazing, said
Wang. Disruptive behavior was
eliminated, studentsiaccomplished
more work (about 90 per cent of the
tasks were completed by the new.
method as compared to about 40

per cent completion by the old), “”“&“  A

whether accounts of the Hardin-

was hypothetical because Cox’ had

A. Communist Party City Council
candidate has proposed a platform
to meet the -need of Pittsburgh
workers. -

Beth Edelman, Communist Party
member of eighteen years, said,
“We're talking about an area of the
country that produces ‘a good
proportion of the country's wealth
and a city that is onel'of the
poorest.'T ,

. Edelman’s platform includes:

--community civilian control of
police -

--outlawingof racism, a central
tool of U.S. monopoly capitalism

--25,000 jobs for Pittsburgh youth

--50,000 black housing units and_

decreased rents
Edelman said.“unemployment in
black—communities is over 35 per

cent-- ﬁvelto six times as much as‘

for whites. She stressed the right
of every person to have alsecure
wel,l paying job.. She also claimed
corporate profits rose 87 per cent in
the first half of 1973 and will

. continue to rise._

_Edelman.feels it is “the right of .

-every child to get an education."

She said the education must be

academically adequate and free of

racist, anti-democratic. and pro-war
“The business of
shunting working class and minorty
children into working ﬁelds without
concern for giving all children a
sound education must stop.’ We're-

 PEACE CORPS

BY MICHAEL CLINTON
This is the third article in a series

on Landlord Tenant issues to be

published each Monday in the Pitt‘
News.

John Q. Public’s landlord dis-
covered that ‘John had been
keeping his German shepherd in
his apartment, contrary to the
clause in his lease, which states ‘no
pets allowed.’

John's landlord decided to evict
him. What can John do?

Nothing.

Eviction is the process where a
landlord exercises his right to ask a
tenant to leave his apartment,
even though the tenant's lease has
not expired.

When a tenant signs a lease, his.
rights and responsibilities are
outlined in the lease that he signs.

Joseph M. Katz will head a fund
campaign to raise $2.5 million for
the improvement of Pitt libraries.

The library campaign is part of
an overall effort to raise $35 million
during the 1970's. -

The library funds are for two
major purposes:

Two million dollars will be used
to close the gaps in the libraries’
collections of periodicals, books,
and reference works.

support new and existing academic
programs. V I
The balance will help to develop

, the application _of new information

handling tools.’ Included in this is
the use of the computer, a
proposed Campus Based Informa-
tion System‘. Such a system could

' centralize access‘ to stored informa-

tion not only at Pitt but nationwide.

Katz has served on the Board of
Visitors for the‘ University's Faculty
of Arts and Sciences. He has also
supported innovative programs in
the College. including providing a
$2,500 prize for the best experi-
mental course designed by either a

_faculty member or student.

He can be evicted for the slightest
violation of ‘that lease, as John
learned after keeping a pet in his
apartment.

Without a lease however, a tenant.
has no responsibilities and no
rights. If a landlord tells him to
move. he must move.

Before a landlord can evict a
tenant. he must notify him either
by registered letter. or by notices
prominently placed - within the
building‘ that the landlord has
obtained an order of court to evict.

The landlord must notify him by
an order from a magistrate. which
gives him 10 days to either move or
reach an agreement with the
landlord, or an order from Common
Pleas Court which gives him 72

The hassle of an eviction might be I

avoided by applying one simple

it. If there are any points that

The first time I saw Albert
Brooks he was feeding Johnny
Carson a line about his newly
created Albert Brooks Famous
‘School for Comediansr

-35” I've seen him many times since

that on various television shows,

- "and I saw him again Friday night.

 

»/

Sitting on a table in a small room '

Will ‘the Major’ ‘be beaten by

' Paladini?

_off stage at David Lawrence Hall,

after the concert, Brooks talked
quietly and _thoughtfully about his
first album, “Comedy Minus
One,” and about theishow.

“The album, 'is alot of ‘new
material, plus a few of the things I
do on stage..like the Richie Havens
story and the anthem.”

The anthem was included in his
performance Friday night. The
premise of the routine is that the
National anthem has become

"outdated and the government is

holding auditions for a new one.
The set was an identification of how
people from different parts of the
country and different social back-
grounds might ' have written the
anthem. It found Brooks talking
and singing and gave him a chance
to display his talents as a pianist as
well. ' -'

Brooks onstage is a compelling

performer, Maybe it’s drawn from
his days at CMU as a drama
student. He not only presents his
strange brand of comedy through
the dialogue of his routines, he
throws. himself into the act

Brooks’ movie of the animal
kingdom fails to arrive but he
decides to do it as best he can by
furiously ﬂipping page after page
of pictures of animals in a book.
[All in time to the MasonWilIiams
hit.] When Brooks is out of pages
and out of luck, we think, he tears
backstage only to appear again and
again first with a stuffed rabbit and
later with assorted other animal
props.

His unique blend "of insight and
humor lets Brooks come up with
such unusual comedy routines that

is Albert Brooks. And Carson
always introduces him in one
word---weird.

Brooks’ performance followed
“Fanny” an all woman rock group.

iHe voiced the needless reserva-

tions he felt about following them
as he sat in the projection room of
David Lawrence waiting to come on

“I wasn’t surehow the audience
would react to me. They responded
very nicely to Fanny. They were
adjusted to what Fanny was doing
really well..you know.. they were
dancing and clapping and all that...
and then when I came on they
made the total adjustment again
and it was just great. That's when
a concert is good.. when people can
make that total adjustment to each
performer.” '

His show was interrupted a few
times by a heckler in the back who
was shouting a few inane com-
When
asked if it bothered him Brooks
said, “ No, it was really fine. l’ve
had, more drunk fans yelling to do
the such and such routine because
they like it. They’re not hostile and

, ' they even know my stuff. It’s really

crazy. If they were hostile it would
be really bad. But they’re usually
they’re not they’re

The hecklers allow Brooks to come
up with things on the spur of the
moment, which is what he‘ strives
for. _

Brooks did a great spur of the
moment routine with the tinfoil that

“served as the backdrop for the light '

reflection while Fanny was per-
forming. Climbing up the tinfoil,

explaining the derivation of the

the crazy, zany art of improvisation
that is so refreshing.

He writes all of his own material.
[“If‘ you can do it, it’s, the best
way.’7] When asked how he comes
up with most of it, Brooks said, “I

‘Dr. Robert Nossen, Associate
Provost For Regional Campuses,
said that he is aware of these
problems and that his staff and
Vice-Chancellor Moye’s staff on
Orientation have begun working on
them. “But I guess we obviously
haven’t done enough yet," he said.

Nossen agreed that something has

should make their gripes known to

“Plans are currently underway to

already undergone some changes,

The Pitt ‘Children's Crusade’ had accumulated ‘a 16-0 lead .in.the first

But in the second half, the Majorites seemed to want to ride their lead

But as Navy Quarterback Al Glenny ﬂipped a 33 yard touchdown

g_‘Cooper dove in for the two point conversion with 3:51 "left in the game,
the 17-16 Middie lead seemed mighty secure.

‘ An_observer in the press box leaned over and said, “Now we’ll see

Football players are human beings and accordingly are made of ﬂesh
and bones.‘ But the football ﬁeld, where pride battles pride and

it J sfrength and intesity often brings superhuman effort, is no place for

complacent human behavior. Billy Daniels, Dorsett and James Farley

proved that.

“We came back with the same play because it was so open before,”

» They showed me a lot. They had enough. character to get it done.”

Offensive line «coach Joe Avazzano adamantly agreed. “That effort
showed us that the degree of intensity always equals the quality of
performance. We lacked the spark to be intense in the second half.
We. just can’t show up and expect to beat people,” Avazzano said.
“We're not that good yet.”

"I've never played a Navy team. but I had heard that they fight you to
the end and never give up. They showed me a lot out there today."

_ V The win was the first at home this year and all the enthusiasm in the

stands made it a worthy Homecoming affair. Truely, Pitt Stadium was

A “Someplace Special” on this day.

Dorsett was the big gun in thisl

attack. He carried eight times for
55 yards in the drive. including the
scoring play. a one yard leap over
the center of the Pitt line.

Navy’s first play after thekickoff
was an attempted pitchout by
quarterback Al Glenny, but tail-
back Ed Gilmore was hit as he
received the ball, and Pitt Monster
back Mike Bulino pounced on the
loose football at the Navy 11.

It may. be a little late in the
season tostart winning, but the Pitt
soccer team has finally broken out
of a year long. slump.
opening the season with a 9-0
trouncingof Geneva. they went
through a string of six winless
games. salvagingjust one tie. But,
the booters finally got things
rolling and have now won three

games in a row, including a 3-1'
victory over Grove City College last —

Saturday afternoon at Pitt Stadium.

The-victory raised the Panther"s
record to 4-5-1 with only four
games remaining. The win didn't
come easy as the Red Machine
from Grove City battled the Pitt
team throughout the game. With
only eleven minutes gone" in the

- first half. Grove City opened the

scoring. Tom Flemming was able
to beat the Pitt defense to score a
beautiful unassisted goal which
gave the visitors a big lift.

Fortunately, the Panthers were
able to come right back. Al Jutca
fed a fine pass to John Curley,
Pitt's speedy left wing, who fired a
shot passed the surprised Grove
City goalie to tie the score at one
goal apiece. '

After 

The score remained even for most
of the first half. Both teams were
able to move the ball but ‘tough
defensive_ play on the part of both
teams kept the ball out of the nets.
Pitt coach Leo Bemis subsituted
freely throughout the first half
giving his youfngenplayers a chance
to see some action.-

With only five minutes remaining
in the first half, Pitt was able to
score again. John Curley got his
second goal of the game when he
took a pass from centerman Joe
Luxbacher and fired it into the right
corner of the Grove City goal. Th_at
gave the Panthers a 2-1 lead at
halftime and also proved to be the
winning goal.

The second half turned out to be
mainly a defensive struggle with
the Pitt booters gaining a slight
edge. They were able to control
much of the play with their
excellent ball handling and pass-
ing. Nevertheless. the Grove City

defense fought off the attackers.

turning the play against the Pitt
nets. This end-to-end play
continued»-for nearly the entire
second half with Denny Kohlmeyer
and Bill Haines leading the tough
Panther defense.

, Finally, with less than a minute to
play Bill Rex got the third ‘Pitt goal,
putting the game out of reach.

V Coach Bemis had put Rex in the

game just moments before-Fin an
attempt to get some more speed in
the Panther attack. Rex took a pass
-from Luxbacher and found himself
one-on-one with Grove City goalie
Frank Proccopio. He placed a
beautiful shot into the far corner of
the net to insure a Pitt victory.

Pitt’s next game will be played
‘tomorrow afternoon at 1:30 when
they meet Slippery Rock in the
Stadium. This game will be the
fourth West Penn Conference
game for the Panthers so far this
season but they have already been
eliminated from this year’s top
honors. They currently hold a 2-1
mark in league play with three
games to go.

The booters need to win at least
three of their remaining four games
to top the .500 mark. Hopefully,
they can win their next three games
before traveling to Penn State for
the big season finale. If they can
continue the style of play they have
shown in the last three games. they
should be able to do" it.

ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR

If head football coach Johnny
Majors were writing this article, all
he would have to say is “I told you
so."

Majors would, of course. be
re_fering to his freshman place-
kicker, Carson Long, who finally
gave Pitt fans something to cheer
about by kicking three ﬁeld goals to
pace Pitt's victory ' over Navy
Saturday. -

Long had come under considera-
ble criticism from some observers
his failure to put the ball
through the uprights for three
points in Pitt's-» first six games.
He'd been the victim of a few bad
snaps in the beginnning of the
season but just missed on a couple
opportunities following Pitt's first
two encounters.

“Coach Majors never lost confi-
dence in me,” Long said from his

’locker in a remote corner of the

dressing room after the win. “I got
off to,a horrible start; I missed four
in a row. But we have a philosophy
here-opportunity lost can never be

» regained.”

’At every press luncheon, inter-
view and post game conference,
Majors always had the same

question asked; When is Carson.

It wasn't Long carrying the ball

to stand as the most important

the fact that -those field goals came
from 47, 30 and 49 yards.

the affair came with advance

Tony Dorset_t. One recordwas tied
by a Pitt Freshman, Carson Long,
and that was three field goals in a
single game, set back in 1925.
Long didn’t know that he’d had his
name entered in the record books.

“I was thinking about anything,"
Long reflected. “All I knew before
that first kick was that I had a
chance to go'one for five."

Just what was the problem with"
Long early in the year? :He

condoms for men

who hate condoms

For ears condoms have been a necessary evil—essential
but no very nice to use. So we at Adam & Eve sorted out
all the little things that make condoms less than pleasant,
and we developed new Jade.

ONE: Most condoms are too thick for real pleasure. Jade is
so sheer you can hardly feel it. Yet because it is made of
the very finest latex under strict government standards,
Jade is as reliable as any condom you can buy.

TWO: ‘Cheap lubricants have an unpleasant medicinal smell.
Jade is_ specially lubricated with AE66 silicone "love oil"
which IS odorless and.won’t evaporate. This makes Jade
easier to put on and gives much greater sensitivity.
THREE: Ordinary condoms come in a cold clinical pack.
Jade comes in a tastefully-designed soft wallet. lt's sensual
not clinical.

FOUR: Jade sheathsyare pale green, which apart from being
the color of masculine energy, makes them readily visible.
So you don't have to worry if they're on properly.

FIVE: Jade even eliminates the _awliward problem of what
to do after. Each sheath _comes with its own self-seal plastic
envelope for neat, esthetic disposal. v

So if you hate to use condoms, mail the coupon and have
the pleasure of letting Ja'de, _the very un-ordinary contra-
ceptive, change our mind. It will_be sent with our illustrated
catalogue in a p ain package. Satisfaction guaranteed or your

 money back. .3,
