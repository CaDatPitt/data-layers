 Study Commission Report   

BY ED HOLLIN
Campus policemen are concerned
about potential danger to their
,. seniority system and gun_ regula-
 .. tions in the wake of a summary
S report of recommendations by a.
commission investigation the oper-~
V ation of the security force.
L‘ The commission's original report
jiﬁ-xtotals over. 100 pages, but the only
 available clue to its contents is a
three page summary. A single
copy of the original is filed in Vice
Chancellor Joseph Dutton’s office,

‘ arousing concern the policemen are
being denied full access.

Although the summary outlines
eleven ‘areas of recommendation,
the most controversial ones deal

__ with force operationsiand weapons.

if Proposed elimination of the fixed
post system, under which officers
bid for posts according to seniority
drew most of the fire.

",Th_ey‘re trying to do away with
the union seniority system by
placing you where they want to,"
said officer Aft Droman. “I've had
years in this car. I know it better

., than somebody who's_ been in a

 “They’re trying to break down the
system,” another officer said.

Several patrolman opposed the

report's recommendations for the

University to issue all weapons and

collect them‘ at the end of each

shift.

"They want to issue: all depart-

ment guns." Dorman said, “Some

"VI of them are unsafe, overused.‘ If
it's my life depending on it, I want
to know‘ that weapon will work if
needed. If it's your owngun, you
know it and take care of it.

The controversial' Oakland
Crosstown Expressway may have
been-put to rest by citizen protest
and ﬁnancial restraints. The
northern stem of the proposed
multi-million dollar project which
would have cut through Panther
Hollow, has been blasted by critics
as‘ “insane" and “a potential

Construction of the road has been

Low School   Expansion Begins

BY BOB EVANS

A ﬁve-year plan designed to
expand enrollment and all other
facets of Pitt's Law School is now in
progress, according to Professor
Richard Seeburger, chairman of

the Law School Admission Com-

mittee. .

“The program, as approved, by.

the Provost and the Chancellor,
gives us firm commitments for the
hiring of new faculty, and
expansion of the library and other
resources so that we can make

commitments and begin our

been rescheduled for construction
between the years 1990 and 2000
for similar reasons?“ ‘

A need for the entire Oakland
Crosstown, part of a larger CYCLE
11 plan for this part of the state. still
exists according to planning chief

for the South West -Pennsylvania

Regional Planning Commission
(SWPRPC).iChuck DiPietro.

“From the transportation view we
saw need for the entire length of
the Crosstown. Without it the
system is not as circumferential as
it should have been.

“PennDOT saw it as being
extremely costly, and saw xthe
possibility of it never-being built. I

At the end of the ﬁve years, we
will have a full-time teaching ‘
faculty of at least 26, exclusive of
librarians and deans. who also have
faculty rank, austudent body of
approximately 650, and a library of.
twice the resources it presently
has. Our expectation is that we will
be in the new building in
September of 1975.

“This-represents a 42% increase

in student enrollment with a 46°76
increase in full-time instructors,"
he said.

Seeburger ‘emphasized the en-

panied by a flowering in the
accepted admission standards.

“No, this program will have no
effect on our standards,” he said. A
“As things presently exist, we see

no deterioration in the credentials _,

of entering students. We should
have no trouble at all ﬁlling up the
school with highly qualiﬁed stu-
dents." '

The dropout rate in the school
rose last year in comparison to the

previous year, but Seeburger did *

not view this as a deﬁnite trend.

There will be no deterimental
effect on the entire plan. according
to DiPietro._ although, removal of
the Crosstown will eliminate one of
the circumferential routes for
trafﬁc moving cross-city. ’
‘Although citizen protest may have
contributed to the postponement,
the-primary factor in the delay was
the lack of necessary funding for
the project according, to John
Robin, a member of the Transpor-
tation Advisory Committee and
Pitt's School of Public Affairs.

"The choice was dictated by

The controversial Hockey Club
issues came up at the meeting, but
for only a short time. F urick said
he called the County Commission-

Club could have had free ice time
had they contacted the Commis-
sioners’ office.

He saidhe also called the Pitt
Athletic Department and learned
the Hockey Club could have had
free uniforms for the asking.

“It seems like they haven't been
doing anything," Furick said of the
club.

Board member Bruce Keeler
complained, “They’re just waiting
for us to come to them and ask how

After the meeting, three SGB
members responded to an editorial
in Wednesday's edition of the Pitt
News decrying their poor attend-
ance at SGB summer sessions.
Paul Hertneky. Mary Heider, and

reasons as the cause of their

Board formally consider the matter
by September 13. The‘ Judicial
Board held,a hearing last Tuesday
and announced the new sanction,
effective until the end of the term.

When notiﬁed of the decision,
Meloro said. ‘‘It was pretty close to
what I recommended." He
commented on the appeal process,
noting the IFC Appeal Board has
the option of upholding, rejecting,
lessening or recommending ‘pen-
alty.

Natali, who said she has not been
formally notiﬁed of the request for
an appeal, emphasized the need for
some substantial grounds for such

, an appeal.

“We can't call the Appeal Board

together merely to hear someone

complain that he doesn't like the
penalty. ‘If there is a basis for an
appeal, such as new evidence, the

, Board will certainly entertain it."

According to the IFC constitution,
the appeal process consists of a
requst for an appeal from the
fraternity" to the advisor. who
forwards it to the Board of Appeal.
The board includes the Fraternity
Advisor, a fraternity faculty advisor
and a member of the Executive
Board of IFC. '

made three years ago by an
acoustic engineer, Dr. Kenneth
Stewart, to improve the audibility
of the auditorium,” said David

,Crossman, Assistant Director of
the University Libraries.

According to Crossman, the
panels are a -white’, porous and
spongy fiber glass one to two
inches th/ick which is intended to
improve audibility. ln addition, he
made a request for acoustic im-
provement three years ago.

He pointed out the reason
construction _is underway now
instead of three years ago is
because the price tag was too
great for the University to bear
until recently.

‘‘It was a matter of priority. It
was generally agreed that because
so much money would be spent in
one place, that is was better.to
spread the money out for more
urgent things such inproving the
lighting in classrooms and fix
leaking roofs,” said Hunt Martin,
Physical Plant Director, explaining

cture Hall Gets New Ears

the three year delay.

Martin ‘emphasized acoustics is
more of an art that a science,
therefore results can't be guaran-
teed that the total acoustic problem
would be solved. He was optimistic
most of the problem would be
remedied.

However, the work on the acoustic
treatment of the hall has been
temporarily stopped because of the

"heavy booking of classes in

Lawrence Hall. John Sopcisak,
Manager of Project Services,
predicted work on the hall would
continue again_during the Thanks-
giving break and be concluded
shortly afterwards.

In addition, he explained the work
could have been coinpleted over be
summer but he schedule of classes
prevented ‘all the work from being
completed.

."‘The panels absorb sound and

won’t reflect or transfer the sound
in the auditorium,”
added.

 

David Lawrence Hall should be ﬁt for lectures and movies sometime‘

after Thanksgiving, when the installation of acoustical tiles will

be completed.

An Issue Resolved?  

After weeks of bitter controversy the Director of Student Activities
_’ , Meloro rescinded at last the order of the Student Affairs Ofﬁce
 last July placing Delta Sigma Chic fraternity on probation.
The original decision by Meloro aroused the opposition of Student
fijremnrerit, Delta Sigma Chi, and the Pitt News during the summer
 . At that time the penalty for the fraternity was determined
 the beneﬁt of any public judicial hearings. A series of behind
""',e:’,,'.,scene‘s meeting involving Meloro, Vice Chancellor of Student
 Alfred Moye, the Coordinator of the Campus Judicial System
.. -.. Bowen, the Fraternities/Sororities Advisor Dina Natali, and the
of0rientationJacquelineMullenswhoﬁledtheoriginal
constitutedtheextentofthejudicial proceedingsusedinthe

But now nearly two months after the ill conceived probation order,
,i'tralfraternity' Council President Mark Vernallis successfully
egotiated with Meloro and Moye the rescinding of the order in
change for theﬁling of charges by the IFC executive board against
lta_.Sigma Chi with the, IFC Judicial Board.

Whilesatisﬁed that the case appears near to being resolved, in that
 fraternity will at last seemingly have an opportunity to receive
‘equal justice and due process, since it is now in the jurisdiction
students and not administrators we cannot help but speculate that the
1  of these most recent developments is not coincidental.

the summer. Yet, he waited until September to seek a solution to what
yve, have labeled a tale of horrors.

 all the rancid side issues of the Delta Sigma Chi incident have
 resolved with the reversal of the probation order. The inadequacy
{of the Student Code of Conduct and Judicial Procedures, the campus
judicial system, the actual penalty itself, and the Orientation program
have not disappeared from the scene. And we promise to address
oftrselves to these issues in future editorials.

  PHEAA’s Folly

I  is with overwhelming astonishment that we react to the
fannouncement of the Pennsylvanialligher Assistance Agency that it is
‘considering the possibility of abandoning its program granting aid to
Pennsylvania students attending school outside the state.

_ According to the agency such a policy would encourage Pennsylvania
istitdents to attend colleges in the state. ‘
’AsaresuItoftbePennsyl‘vania State Income Tax, a levy with no
 approved by both houses of the State Legislature and
 four years ago by Governor Shapp, Pemtsylvania
 direct taxpayers of the state. Even though student
 consists either of part time work or full time smnmer
femployment and that the money earned is intended to help pay the
elevating costs of higher education, ﬁnancially wanting students are
 forced to directly subsidize the ‘ operations of state
government. .

.It seems only just, then, that all students regardless of the school they
attend are entitled to ﬁnancial from the state to continue their
education. And certainly a state government that proclaims as one of
L its priorities the education of its youth would reject such an abhorrently
discriminatory plan.  * -

Attica:

BY MARK SATIN OFF

On September 9.11971 close to
1,500 inmates seized one of the
four cellblocks and its adjoining
yard of Attica state prison, and took
40-odd guards and civilian workers
as hostages.

About 85% of the rebels were
Black or Puerto Rican. They
presented a list of demands, for the
second time since July, to New
York State Corrections Commis-
sioner Russell G. Oswald.

Demand number one insisted
upon “adequate food, water and
shelter for all inmates." Other
demands included the right of all
New York State prisoners “to be
politically active without intimida-
tion or reprisal,” more than one
shower a week, and that thebugs

, be washed off the lettuce. In other

words the prisoners were demand-
ing to be treated like human beings
instead of animals.

The rebellion lasted until the
morning of September 13, when a
1,000 man assault force,,ordered by
now Vice-President designate Nel-
son Rockefeller, burst into the
prison area held by the inmates.
Firing indiscriminately, the assult
force murdered 29 inmates and

‘nine guard hostages-_.—-according to

official figures--and_' wounded
over 300 other inmatesx
After it was all over, prison

officials and police told horrifying

I stories of how the inmates had slit

the throats of the hostages and
castrated some of them. But within
24 hours autopsies had proven
these stories complete lies. All had

were no slit throats or castrations
and only the assult force had had
guns.

On September 16 and 30, 1974,

charged with 1,400 felony counts
will go on trial in Buffalo, NY. On

Three Years Later  

proceedings.
Among the reasons cited by the

defense attorneys for the needed"

delay is the gross ﬁnancial in-
equity—'the fact that the state has

i spent more than $6 million dollars

of the taxpayers money on the
prosecution, while the Attica Bro-
thers Legal’ Defense has not re-
ceived a cent of publicly allocated
funds. Also, the ‘defense attorneys
noted the prosecution’s refusal to
turn over fundamental discovery
material to be used as evidence. /
In light of Judge Ball’s ruling,
trial dates for all 61 defendants will
probably be set during the next
week. This is in spite of the fact

‘that a defense motion to dismiss

the charges is pending before the
courts.

Since the brutal crushing of the
Attica rebellion, thousands of arti-
cles have been written about -the
prisons in this so-called free so-
ciety, vainly trying to explain the
roots of the “problems" with the
“correctional system."

The most rectionary and racist
commentators attempt to justify
the Attica massacre with the asser-
tion that the men caged up in
prisons are criminals. -They are not.
They are
“uncivilized" and,‘ therefore,
should be treated like animals.

But millions‘ of other Americans
were struck by the elementary
justice of the demands being raised
and the brutality of the state
And they are trying to
understand what happened at At-
tica

One of.the recurring topics in the
“new mood" inside the prisons.
As Steven V. Roberts of the New
York Times commented on Sept-
ember 19, 1971, “A ‘movement’
paralleling those that have arisen
in recent years amongst the most
widely read authors are Eldridge
Cleaver, .Malcolm X and George
Jackson.

The prisons contain many of the
most articulate and conscious
spokespersons for Black liberation.
It was precisely their rebellion
against this racist, capitalist society
which led to their imprisonment in
the first place. ‘

There will almost certainly be
more Atticas. - Prison "reform is

2’

important. Every improvement
that gains a few more human and
civil rights will help make life just
that much more bearable for so-
ciety’s victims. But even the most
humane a prison is still aprison,
and such revolts will recur as long
as men and women are put behind
bars for struggling against the
inequities of this system— that is,
as long as capitalism remains
intact. \

Almost every act this society
defines as a “cirem" can ultimate- rag
ly be traced to a system of minority M
rights and privilege-——and the cli- ,-
mate of violence, brutality and

desperation it causes—ca1led

capitalism.’ .

Most people who are in prison 4
today are there for the “crime” of
trying to survive in a society which
makes survival exceedingly diffi-
cult. Even murder and rape can
ultimately be_ traced, almost with-
out exception, to the social inequit-
ies and distortion of human poten-
tial and character that are rooted in
capitalist society.

The Attica Brothers Legal De-
fense has called for a demonstra-
tion to coincide with the third
aniversary of the ‘Attica uprising
and massacre. The rally will "be
held on Saturday, September 14, in.
Buffalo, NY.

The demands being put forward
by the Attica Brothers and the
Legal Defense are: 1) drop all
indictment. 2) jail the real cri-
minals—Rockefeller, Oswald and
the state troopers and 3) implement
the original Attica demands.

More information of the rally can



'be obtained at the Medical Com-

mittee for Human Rights.
President Ford’s order granting
total amnesty to Richard Nixon for
all Watergates crimes is just one
more example of the double system
of justice that exists in this country.
To avoid revealing himself as a
total Hypocrite, Ford should -do
nothing less than immediately
grant complete and unconditional
amnesty to the Attica Brothers. ,

BY SYBILLA SUDA

The University Counseling Cen-
ter offers opportunities for person-
al, educational, and career devel-
opment to all members of the
University community, undergrad-
uate and graduate students, faculty
and staff, having problems in those
areas. Approximately 90%‘ of
those seeking assistance are

i undergraduates, and the balance of
men and women is about equal.

“Students come with all kinds of

‘,;_:_ problems,” said Dr. Robert Gal-

_L~"l/lagher, Director of the Counseling

Service and a member of a panel of

six counseling psychologists at the

center. “These are mostly

instances of career and personal
problems overlapping.”

The Counseling Service is divided
into three sections consisting of (1)
General Psychological Services, (2)
the Career Planning Division and
(3) a project still in its infancy, the
Reading and_ Studies Skills Depart-
ment. , '

Personal counseling is available
on either an individual or a group
basis,~but most of those persons
_seeking help opt for the former. A

Tqiijnleyss a specific counselor is
i requested they are assigned
randomly. , If personality clashes
should arise, however, another
counselor will promptly be as-
signed. A person seeking. help may

do so on an appointment or walk-in
basis, and within a week a
counselor will usually be available.

Standing orders exist to interrupt

"3 a counselor in emergency cases.

3 Students, suffering from severe
emotional disturbances are re-
ferred to the Health Center, which
in turn can refer patients to
Western Psychiatric Hospital.

By Gallagher’s estimate, most

students .come in for three or four

, visits, although no limit exists. In a

questionnaire distributed by the

Counseling Center last year, 70%

‘E; who had been here at one time or

. ' another responded that they ' had

been helped. The remaining: 30%

were largely indifferent, while only
very few responded ’ negatively.

The Counseling Center is located
at 205 Schenley Hall, and is open
from 9:00 am until 5:00 pm Monday
through Friday, while Monday

night, 6-9 pm, will also be reserved

for counseling purposes.
According to Gallagher, many
don’t seek help because either,
“they feel their problem isn’t
serious enough or that the problem
is two serious.” He especially
expressed concern over incoming

T}. freshmen and transfer studentsf

many of whom experience the not
uncommon phenomenon of acute
homesickness, and feel too a-
shamed to talk about it. _

In an effort to alleviate this

solitary suffering, Gallagher last A
year sent out a letter explaining the '

services offered, encouraging stu-
dents to take advantage of them.-
As a result, an increased number of
students participated in this free,
completely conﬁdential program
(no records of 'counseling inter-
views are kept), and Gallagher is

sending "out another letter this _

. year.
i:>;3‘The grapevine is the‘ biggest
 factor in our intake of students,”
he said, “yet many other students
who. might profit from the

counseling we offer just don*t‘know_

aboutvit.” _ I
eTl,1;,e‘_=,LCareer Planning Division of

_f_w1de5 range {of

 

 ,th’e*Counseling Service also offers a  -

graduate students. Some of these
include: assistance in career
planning such as pre-professional
services and a Career Library (206
SU) featuring a comprehensive,
up-to-date ‘collection of career
information.

Also provided are Academic and
Career Planning tapes of struc-
tured interviews with the chairman
from some 42'departments.

“Students have found them very _

helpful,” Gallagher said, “and
they are constantly being updated.’
A The Counseling Center’s letter of
Recommendation Service, allows a
student to open a file with letters of

freshman year, a boon when the
student applies to graduate

"schools, as these letters will be

available to those schools upon the
student’s request.

The counseling Service still has
many other prospective programs it
would like to see put into effect.

“We hope to see lots of students
as a means to expand our career
planning services,” Gallagher
said. i '

increased student involvement
will greatly beneﬁt students, which
in turn will benef1t.the program

Career Seminar Series‘
Beginning This Month

BY SYBILLA SUDA
The Career Seminar Division.of
the University Counseling Service
will be sponsoring a series of six
seminars this month, open to all
Pittsburgh area college students,
alumni, andthe general public.’
According to Seminar Director
Christine Johnson, this year's
seminars will focus particularly on
the “nuts and bolts of getting a
job.” In fact, two of the sessions
scheduled for September 25 and
Ocober 2, will deal. with career
planning, recent trends in educa-
tion, a‘nd the job market. The other
four sessions include: Health
Related Professions, September
24; Business, Industry and Com-
munications, September 25; Social
Work,‘ Education and Other Help-
ing Professions, September 30; and
Government,
Service, October 1.
These sessions each run from noon
until 3:30 pm in the Student Union
Ballroom. A
Professionals from many different
fields will be present, qualified and
willing to discuss the preparation
needed for certain jobs, opportun-
ities, salaries, competitionyand job
satisfaction. Those participating in
the program can address their

The Black Women’s Task Force is
a clearinghouse for advice and aid,
mediating cases of discrimination
at the University with its services
open to all races, male and female.

’The Task Force has survived a

turbulent, if short, period of evo-
lution to become an established
element in the University Women’s
Center.

Cynthia Vanda, newly_ appointed
director of the Women’s Center,
called the Task Force an informal
organization attempting ‘to deal
with the problems of black‘ women

    
  

on campus, although the group will ,
aid in any case of discrimination,
whether due to race or ‘sex. i ,
“Two years ago,” Vanda said,

Crosstown Plans Halted

money,” Robin said. “It was a
matter of priorities, and it was
decided the outer circumferential
roads were more important.

“In most public projects the
opponents are the most vocal.
Things that serve the majority are
generally unpopular with a few.

“If the demand increases in the
next twenty years for more
highway construction, the plan will
be used. ,I think studies should
continue so a plan would be ready if
there is a demand,” Robin said.

Others in the Oakland community
are relieved to hear of the
postponement, including Jonathan
Robinson of the ‘Neighborhood
Alliance’s Transportation Task
Force.

“It looks dead right now, but we'd
like to see it off the long-range
plan. It should be buried for the
last time-,with a stake in it’s heart.

“There is talk of further studies,
but they should just forget the
costly studies and just kill it.”

The entire Crosstown controversy
surfaced in print last March, when
Robinson described the results

as the projects fatal to Oakland’s
community stability.

“It would be a disaster,”
Robinson said then. “They (the
SWPRPC) don't take into account
who pays the cost of this sort of
thing. , .

“It’s insane to bring more cars
into the Oakland area with
taxpayers money. There is just no
room for them. What we need is
mass transit, not more highways.”

Historically, the geographic corr-
idor which the SWPRPC chose for
the Oakland Crosstown has been
scrutinized as the possible location
of a highway avoiding the

. congested center of the city. This

most recent plan seems fated to
remain a planning dream as well.

DiPietro said although indicators
have delayed construction, the plan
still awaits reactivation.

“We adopted a plan on June 17th
which is now the official long range
transportation program for this
area. The northern part of the
Crosstown is not on those plans,
but the plan is alive.

“Our staff feels there is a demand
for the road in this corridor,” said
DiPietro.

Abe Laufe, Professor Emeritus of
English and noted expert and

author of several books on the

theater, will teach a non-credit’
course this fall as part of Pitt’s
School of General Studies’ Com-
munity Series classes.

“Standing Room Only” will cover
American dramatists who have
copped coveted awards such as the
Nobel, Critics Circle, and Pulitzer
prizes. Laufe will lecture on the
avant garde playwrights who were
notyappreciated in their time but
who becausemajor inﬂuences in
later drama.

The course will cover women’s
inﬂuence in the theatre’s changing
moral code. Laufe will discuss
American theatre censorship and
its development
British censorship.

He will also take to the piano for
part of the course investigation of
musicals. Participants will explore
the history of the American musical
theater and the awardwinning
shows.

Classes will meet on Monday,

Opinion

Pgb. & Music Don't Mix

BY DOUGLAS E. GEBHARD

In September of 1969 Richard Nixon was a threat to millions of young
men...he was sending them to their death in Vietnam. In May of 1970
he was the villian in a bloody play at Kent State. Today Richard Nixon
is in no position to be the imposing power he was then.

The Vietnam war, for most Americans and students, is over. The
pressures of the draft are virtually non-existant. Lifestyles differing
from those of mid-America are generally accepted...longish hair,
fashionwear, musical tastes and even drugs have permeated our
parents’ lives and in turn been ingrained into our Red,‘ White and Blue
culture. . -

In September of 1969 the Grateful Dead had just released “Anthem to
the Sun" and Jefferson Airplane put “Crown of Creation” in the
record bins.- Very little is heard of these groups today, and very little‘
was known of them then. The difference in times? Then there were
few rock bands and today there are so many it’s difficult to get studio
time.

The widespread acceptance of pot and the “rock revolution” has
taken the thrill out of its associated activities... getting high during a
concert with a light-show without the threat of getting beat-up for not
selling any dope to someone or getting together with your friends and
sitting in one row at the show. Today the tickets are handled by
computers or unsympathetic promoters.

That’s possibly why the concert in Cleveland was such an ecstatic
The
audience was there because they had come to see their favorite artists
and not just for something to do. In fact, many had travelled hundreds

of miles--some cross country--to see this particular gig.
Eight-ﬁve thousand fans...the screaming was there...the drugs were

there...the frisbies were there...yep, even the law.

But nothing

seemed to halt the show (i.e.) ﬁghts, ﬁrecrackers, or general idiocy.

The rain didn’t stop it.

It put a damper onrthe spirits of the

crowd...they eventually laughed about it.

A long awaited phenomena had occured for these people--a CSN&Y
concert was taking place and nothing was going to screw it up. Hell.
Why can’t that happen every show? Well, maybe rock has just gone to

our tone-deaf ears.

Maybe too many ‘luxuries have been taken for

granted. Maybe, just maybe, we haven't been seeing things happen.
Or maybe we haven’t heard them’ happen.

L I feel conned by Alice Cooper, David Bowie, Lou Reed and Pat Di
Cesare. I’ve never bought any of these musicians’ albums, but they.
‘have premeated my culture and I don’t like it. I have attended many a

concert‘ though and I’ll tell you what...I feel conned.

I really feel

conned when I can’t pick my own seats or when too many people are
sold to or when a thin market is put in front of me. ..a market that all I’d
have to do is turn on the AM radio to listen to... r

I don’t think Bill Graham screwed me...I got quality music
professionally presented. I heard my bands. The police were kind.
And little guys in red shirts didn’t check my tickets. Thank you Bill

well.

_ Graham. Thank you Cleveland. And for Pittsburgh’s rock scene...oh

Don’t judge ‘an album by its cover

your money on this one. John
Lennon’s clever cover contrasts
with the lack,of originality of the
music. - ' ‘

Pussy Cats was ‘produced by
Lennon whose last album was Mind,
Games.‘ This one should have been
called Mindless Games. A few
songs are outstanding but most fall
into two categories, pleasant Nils-
son compositions similar to his

7 previous work and uninspired ver-

sions of oldies performed with an
all-star back up band.

The highlight of the album is
Nilsson’s version of Jimmy Cliff’s
“Many Rivers to Cross.” The
arrangement is reminiscent of
“Mind Games” and Nilsson even
includes a [Lennon-style scream.
Nilsson’s “Don’t Forget Me” and
“Old Forgotten Soldier” both of
which de-‘emphasize the back-up
band are also very fine. “Mucho

Pork Concert Sponsored

' BY DOUGLAS’ E. GEBHARD

...the wind rolled down the moun-
tainside and we decided to pack it
in. The September air and its cool
bite helped us in our decision.
Down, out of the hills and into the
town...a concert for free. McKen-
dree Spring was playing on Flag-
staff Hill, the hillside arena above
the city, and we thought we'd hear
'em—we'd heard them before a
John Sebastian concert and what
the hell? They’re good. -

On their third album theyhave
“Down ‘By R the River” and in
concert they really cook. They have
a drummer now. And the Profes-
sor—whew! There's this number
called “God,Bless the Revolution"
which their company wouldn’t let
them put on an album. He plays an
amazing violine solo using echo
and modulator. Amazing.
Anyway, the way they do “Down_By
the River” is the best version I’ve
ever heard...yep...the lead guitar-

‘ ist, Martin, wails it out and Frarf’s
vocals are superb. More cutting,
on the chorus, than the guitar
work- .

I don't know what they're doing
now for a label. ,,Last I heard MCA
and them serent seeing eye to eye
and they werelooking for a new
company. Good‘ luck.“ All,their
albums are well produced.
“Spring Suite" is great engineer-
ing. You can’t tell there isn’t a
drum. Really. Vocally...a lot like
the four part harmonies of you

groups who mix acoustic and
electric sounds for a nice refined
effect...folky and yet rock

BY JOHN C. BLACKBURN

The Pitt soccer squad opens its -
\A, 1974 season at Bucknell Saturday,
.. '-where Coach Leo ‘Bemis hopes to

begin a reversal of last year's 4-8-1
record by reversing last year's
opening game disaster.
“We beat ourselves,” Bemis
recalled. “We lost 1-0, and scored
. the only goal against ourselves.

One of our backs tried_to pass back
to the goalie, and it went in.” Even

' so, a one-goal loss to Bucknell is far
s‘ from a disgrace.

“Bucknell nearly made the NCAA
playoffs last y/aer, and they're
returning a veteran team,” Bemis
said. ‘.‘They'll be one of the
toughest teams on our schedule.”

Bemis will try to beat Bucknell
with a team that has “no sure fire

Halfbacks are John Wallace in the
middle, Tom Murphy on the left,
and either Andy Behrend or Peru-A
vian Gualberto Carhuasilla on the
right. All these players are
talented and improving, but exper-
ience may be a problem: ‘of the
nine Rex is the only ‘senior.

“l have a lot of confidence in our
halfback line and forward line,”
Bemis said. “Our attack'll do
OK...if we don't always have to
start in the shadow of our own goal.

“The defense was a complete
wipeout. ‘It’s the first time I’ve
faced a situation with no exper-
ienced fullbacks or goalkeepers to
build around.”

In an effort to add some exper-

'ie/nce to .the vital middle back

positions, Bemis will go with
seniors Jerry Luxbacher and Mark
Venanzi. Neither has any exper-
ience playinginside, however, and
the coach knows he is still dealing

in reserve. Three freshmen are
battling for the goaltposition, with
Frank Bucci likely to start against
Bucknell. Fred Dohrmann and
Doug Soltysiak will also get action
and experience.

,“Last year, we had a veteran team
that was good,” Bemis said, “but
we were unlucky, and wound up

with our first loser in five years. .

This is a young team, but it may
turn things over and fool some
people.” .
Taking his squad’s defensiv
troubles into account, Bemis will
work from a 3-3-4 alignment.
“We’re going to try to play control
ball and eliminate the goal kick.
We'll clear out to the sides, and
avoid the middle where the other
team masses its strength.
“That means there’ll be a lot of
overlap between the outside full-
backs and the wings. We have to

~ ' get at least five people in the act on

attack, so the outside fullbacks
have to think offense." '
Besides Bucknell, Pitt will face a
number of other top-notch teams.
“There's no question Penn State’s
the top team on our schedule,”
Bemis said, “but West Virginia

has been in the NCAA playoffs just

about every year, also.

“But we can compete with anyone
on our schedule. . Last year, a
half-step might've been the differ-

‘ence "in those «one-goal games.
That’s the kind of edge we're
looking for this year.

“But we seem to be in the eyeof
the hurricane. Around Pittsburgh,
high school soccer is still in its
infancy, so we get nothing out of
our natural draw area.

“But we play good soccer, and we
think we'll have a spirited and
interesting ballclub. An area I

Panthers-Seminoles Clash In Opener

Coach Mudra, isn’t saying. His
statements concerning the ‘Semi-
noles have been filled with skept-
icism, possibly in an attempt to
instill overconfidence in his op-
ponents. But thenfact still remains
that everywhere Darrell Mudra has
been, namely Adams State, North
"Dakota State, Arizona, and West-
tern Illinois, he has turned a ,_big
loser into a big winner.’ .

The Seminoles are a very youn
team. Theyfwill be playing with
quite a few sophomofes. Many of
these players saw action last year
and will be anxious to show their
new head coach they can do the
job.

“The team has
tively so «far in

responded posi-
practice,” says

Mudra. A“They are pretty well
committed to do as well as they
can."

The Florida State offense is the
veer-T, which is run with split
backs. The offense enables them to‘
run plays with three options and
they.-will be expected to throw from
thisalignment. They will flood the
Panther defense with‘ as many as
five receivers which will keep Pitt’s
defensive secondary honest.

Florida Stateis quarterback is
to be Ron Coppess,

a transfer from Palomar Junior Col-
‘lege. Hehas good ‘size, 6-3, 215,
and is a definite threat to run. He
has a very strong arm enabling him
-to throw the bomb, but the lack of
speed among the A Seminole re-
ceivers may force FSU to use a
short passing game.

Sophomore Mike Shumann and
Senior Mike Allen should be the
starting ‘wide receivers Saturday.
Both lettered last year, with Shu-
mann leading the team in, recep-
tions with 21 catches for 380 years.
Allen was close behind with 19
catches for 280 yards. However,
Mudra_ rates his receiving team
‘only as adequate although he feels
they should do the job.

“Our receivers don’,t have excep-
tional speed,” Mudra says. “They

Model“  

BY YAIERA LEHRER

If one were asked to describe the
value of Pitt fullback Dave J anasek,
he would find himself trying to
tackle a nearly impossible task.
For Janasek is the model for any
position on the team.

“I think that Dave exempliﬁes the
kind of player you like to have
working for you,” said Backfield
"Coach Harry Jones. “He’s tough.
He’s notafraid to get caught in the
middle of all the action and he
always gives us the best perfor-
mance possible out of his ability.”

“I try and give 110% on each and
every play," said Janasek. “As a
senior, I'm expected to be a leader,
and if other players see me pushing
hard, it become contagious, with
everyone giving their best for the
team which after all is what it's all
about.” " H I V

“I guess I would like to run the
ball a little more," says Janasek,
but is again very quick to point out
that “I’ll play wherever they need
me and do whatever is necessary to
make Pitt a winner."

“There's a lot of pride on this
team, and all of us are pretty
close," Janasek said. “I know the
guys will all be doing their job, and
I want to be able to do my job and
not let the rest of the guys and
myself down. ' '

If there is any fault to be found in
his play. J anasekls coach can't ﬁnd
it.

“I can’t think of anything wrong
with the way Dave plays," said
Jones. “His attitude is the best
possible both on and off the field,
and by putting everything he has
into the game he serves as a great
example for the younger players."

“There's a lot on the line, this
season,” said Janasek. “Last
year. no matter what we did. it was
an improvement. People are
expecting a lot more of us now and
we can’t disappoint them. We
have pride in oprselves, our
coaches, school, and most impor-
tant, the team. That's the way it is,

M Panther Defensive

BY JIM SPANOS

If the status of the Pitt offense at
this time is uncertain. the
defensive situation might be
described as being optimistic. The
defense against Florida State will
have to be strong. I In plain words,
is the defensive machine ready to
go?

One man with a clear perception
of the strengths and weaknesses of
the defensive {unit is Jackie
Sherrill, assistant head coach and
defensive coordinator of the Pitt
squad: Sherrill is well aware that

-r-. returning from last year’s team_are

-,,_\

' sports talent.

K‘;

‘T three starters from the defensive
line, linebacker Kelcy Daviston,
and the entire defensive backfield.
Yet, Sherrill has his reservations
regarding certain aspects of the
defense.

“We don't have the depth at some
positions that we would like,"
Sherrill said.

No matter how much depth a team
possesses, coaches are constantly
striving for more, and for good
reason. It is depth which can carry
a team through a tough eleven
game schedule, and also provides a
team with personnel from one year
to the next.

In the Pitt defensive secondary,
for example, returning starters
Mike Bulino, Glenn Hodge, David
Stapes and Dennis Moorhead are
all experienced‘ players. Beyond
that, however, the second string
defensive backfield is comprised of
four sophomores with little playing
experience. Yet the problem, if
any, which this will cause Pitt
against Florida State should not be

By the time August rolled around,
Pitt was caught in the middle of a
tug—of-war between the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) and the brand new
Association of Intercollegiate Ath-
letics for Women (AIAW).

Bullman had followed NCAA
recruiting procedures back in April
and May, but found that the AIAW
frowned upon such tactics. The
AIAW opposes schools going out to
the student, preferring the student
to show an interest in the university
before she can be recruited.

While Bullman would rather stick
with the NCAA, she is “forced”
into the AIAW, as the NCAA does
not have a women’s division.

Bullman is pleased with her
basketball team. She should be,
she has three six-footers playing.
She also predicts the cagers will be
among the top teams in the country
within a year’s time. The girls will
be ‘playing “a few” preliminary
games at the Field House, with the
men being the main attraction.

very extensive.

Pitt is not overly optimistic as it
prepares for game number one in
the 1974 campaign.

In Sherrill's word, ‘.‘No, I don’t

‘think the team will be taking them

too lightly."

Pitt will employ_a 5-2 defense
against Florida State, which means
they will have a five man front, two
linebackers, and four men in the
secondary. Florida State will attack
the Cats defensive alignment with
a veer type of offense, from which
they will run and do a substantial
amount of passing.

Gary Burley. an All-American
candidate. will lead the Panther
pass rush from his middle guard
Also joining Burley on
the defensive line is Tom Perko, a
senior who occupies one of the
defensive end positions. Burley
and Perko are confident the
defense can contain Florida State.

“We're ready to go," Burley said,
and Perko, disclosing a slight grin,
added, “We're going for a
shutout."

the experience, and consequently

the confidence which good teams.

must possess.

One players who reflects all three *1
of these ingredients is Mike Bulino; :;

a senior who plays monsterman, a_

slightly_modiﬁed linebacking ipo-..
Bulino lines up on‘ the? 1
strong side of the opponen_t’s —
offense, and is responsible for the A

sition.

team decides to run. Bulino noted
the team though perhaps not as
enthusiastic as they were last year

going into the first game,‘has 

begun to show more spirit.

“The team morale picked up a lot»... 

this week in practice," Bulino said,
“and as opening games
closer. it should continue to do so."

Bulino mirrors Sherrill's feelings‘ .
that the team won't go into the
Flordia Stat'e game with too ‘much , _
conﬁdence. Although Florida State P  5;».
was 0-11 last year. remember that 
Pitt was 1-10 in 1972. Flordia State  

has a new coach, Darrell Murda. as

did Pitt after the disastrous season I 

in 1972. The comparison between

the two schools ends right ther_e.‘~ "Ti
and the Pitt defense sure will try to“

keep it that way.
