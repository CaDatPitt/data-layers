Chanccllorl Bowman Notes
Wide Interest In Project

Rest and relaxation from the du-
ties of . chancellorship were found
this summer by Chancellor John‘ G.
Bowman in his tour of the world
which extended over a period of
three and one-half months. The
chancellor. was accompanied in the
.-tour by Professor’ Percival’ Hunt,
head.of' the English department,
andiby his son. ‘ '

In the course, of his journeys,
Chancellor Bowman found a wide-
spread interest in the Cathedral of
Learning and the ideals for which
it is being constructed. On the day
following the arrival of the party
in Sydney, Australia, the news-
papers appeared with stories and
pictures of the new building. Dur-
ing his visits at the various Eng-
lish universities, Chancellor Bow-
man found the school heads follow-
ing the progress of the Cathedral
of Learning with interest curious
about the latest developments in
the plans. They are looking to the
project because it is original, and

 

different and expressive of the

American spirit, Dr. Bowman

stated. I .
Chancellor Bowman visited a

number of the English Cathedrals,
anong which were the Cathedrals of
York, Durham, Winchester and
Gloucester, and was impressed by
the grandeur and magniﬁcence of
these creations. These observa-
tions served m strengthen. his con-
viction of the beneﬁts to be. derived
from a building of similar propor-
tions in our own university. life.

. Comparing the resources and
growth of the United States with
that of the countries through which
he passed, the’ chancellor believes
that this nation is on the verge of
a creative era of as wide a scope
as that of many of the great eras

First "xv.-;.-gklyln’ Editor visits 

An August visitor at the. alumni
office was Frank C. Stewart, Bus.‘
Ad. ’12, editor of “The Pitt Week-.
1y.”‘ Stewart-V_V1s located in Cleveland,
being. a member of the editorial
staff of “The Cleveland Press.” He
spent his vacation inthe "Pittsburgh
district. His? home was formerly in
Tarentum, Pa.‘ ‘ .

Incidentally, the first issue of “The
Weekly,” was gotten out in the fall
of" 1910 and was a. one-page affair.
The. second issue went to four pages
and the rest of “The Weeklies” that
year had that number of pages. “The
Weekly” supplanted;“The Courant-,”f
a monthly publication at the timethe
university was moved fromthe old
Perrysville avenue site, N‘. S., to the
Schenley Farms.

 

 

A Dr. Stevenson In Vienna

Dr. J. W. Stevenson, Med. ’12, of
McKeesport, is in Vienna, Austria,’
doing researchwork in medicine. Dr.

 

ball team in the ’08, '09, 10 and '11
days and was a tackle feared by all

-Stevenson, who assists “Jock” Suth-
erland as a football -coach. We un-
derstand that Dr. Stevenson plane to
give up general practice on return-
ing from abroad and will specialize
on a certain branch of his profession.
It is. unlikely that he will return to
McKeesport.‘ ‘ V V

QUO VADIS. PITI‘?

Elsewhere in these columns may be found
a fervent outburst of an effervescent freshman
who a. few days ago left his ﬁery contribution
with us, signed with the all-sufﬁcing yet some-
what forlorn “One of the Abused.”

From what we can gather, the writer seems
to scorn the feebleness, the gentility, the well-
nigh apologetic spirit in which the enforcement
"of "freshman regulations was enshrouded this

. year. He scoffs at the sophomores for their

lack of class patriotism andpersonal pride in

' permitting the character of “Agony Day” to

if". _ change from the sheer brutal to the ridiculously

-‘tame.’ Docility has supplanted savagery, and

phlegm now occupies the pedestal formerly

 claimed by. harshness; the days of the oak

._\"?_

paddle are few, and soon the Borgian sopho-

A more will ‘be a rarity.—-according to the writer--

However, despite the good intentions of the
writer, whose interest at this primitive stage

 i of his college career presages a great love for
‘ -. ,‘ his Alma Mater, we feel that he has been sadly
.‘ m.isled on several issues. In the first place, his
, statement about the frosh being forced to wear_

 '. the regulation head-dress and black ties is not

quite true; for in’ no other year has the stimu-
lus been quite so voluntary among the'year-
lings.
“Agony Day" is no reﬂection on the stability of
frosh regulations; for this particular day of
'tornient is not a bona ﬁde regulation, but
rather an extraneous and arbitrary event. But
the most incriminating aberration of our
writer is the validity he attached to the im-
pression of college which he maintains the

. ‘ Panther gave him. The credibility he lavished

upon the content of our humorous publication
is an acid test of his naivete. But perhaps by

‘ some arrangement, another “Agony Day” can

be planned, the program of -which will include
suspension by the thumb-nails, carbolic acid
baths or deep gash-inflicting contests staged

fby. wild sophomores wielding poniards and

bread-knives.

Where goest thou, Pitt? Who knows, unless.

it be toward realmsof greater understanding
and bonhomie.
 
WHAT TO DO WITH TIME?
Probably one of the most puzzling problems

for the student entering upon his college

career is! that of the best and most desirable
-use of his time. The shortened time‘ of actual

 » classroom work as compared with the long,

conﬁning hours of classes in high school is
.quickly recognized as a means of greater free-
dom, opening up unlimited possibilities for in-

'  div,-i'dua1 development. Some few students are

 
  
 
 
 
   
     
 

T’ .1.‘ .

’- ,..,:,,.:..;=¢,hanges being worked out in the athletic

content to use their free hours solely for the
‘continuance cf their studies. The majority of
students, however, tend to devote but a
-minimum of time for their studies, turning to
activities and the social groups on the campus
for ‘diversion and broader experience. The
entrance into activities can have su_ch a power-
ful inﬂuence upon the success or failure of
college careers that it is well for each fresh-
man to consider well before leaping.

The actual classroom work and the highly

organized world of campus activities and social
groups have more in common than is seen on
the surface. Fundamentally, each aims at the
provision of ample opportunities for the de-
velopment and self-expression. of each student.
In’ the classroom comes the awakening of the
student to his- mental powers and abilities
coupled with learning and the direction of his
abilities into ﬁelds where he may -use them
best. In activities, the student has the‘ chances
_to puthis abilities to the test and to discover
his place as a social being. - V

The system of activities is continual
changing and broadening to meet the deman 7

., V, of the students engaged therein. Activities are
‘.4€a'§clay for the students to mold, not a ﬁxture

shaping the individuality of the students.
Activities, consequently, ‘allow for a full play

._f,he_initiative and originiality of each par-
i‘_pant-;.  Evidence of this is seen in the rad-

Quite different is A.Cood Woman,
by Louis Bromﬁeld, the last of a

series of four novels dealing from

various angles with life in industrial
America. - The Good Woman is
Emma Downes, and good she is to
the point of irritability. When her
husband, probably frightened by the
prospect of years and years of
being domincered and reformed and
sanctiﬁed, left her without warning,
she invented a. respectable explana-
tion, opened a. bake-shop, and saw
to it that Philip, her son, grew as
she wanted him to grow. He was
to devote his lifeto‘. God, she said,
and pushed him off‘ to Africa as a
missionary, accompanied by a. sex-
less religious freak to whom she ‘had
married him.’ As babies in Africa
would be troublesome, Mrs. Downes
arranged that the marriage be in
name only. Satisﬁed that she had
done her duty, she sat back to enjoy,
the respect of the community. But
Africa awoke in Philip the individu-
ality and aesthetic desires his
mother had repressed. The novel
describes his gradual realization

that his mother has made happiness .

and self-realization impossible for
him. There is but one escape. A
The story, it can be seen, has ele-
ments of tragedy. ‘That they are
not worked into a tragedy .of Drei-
serian proportions‘ is due to Mr.
Bromﬁeld’s carelessness or inability.
Energy is spent in making over-
obvious the selﬁshness and blindness
of the mother, that might have been
used to give the son more reality,

to put convincing flesh on the bones.

of his admirable qualities. As he
appears, one doubts if he could have
amounted to much or been very
happy even though Emma had died
when he was born. The ending is
inevitable, but lacks subtlety. The
best thing-——by fa.r—-in the book is
the tragedy of Philip's wife and her
elopement with the Reverend Castor.
Jason Downes, the husband who
left Emma, is also worth knowing.
A Good Woman is serious work,
one has to admit, and it in no way
diminislies the belief expressed when
The Green Bay Tree appeared, that
Mr. Bromﬁelclhas the potentialities
of a- Dreisér. [It is certainly better
than his Early Autumn, which won
the Pulitzer Prize last spring. .
Belatedly, we announce; what was
kept from you last -week by edi-
torial parentheses. This column is

devoted to the leisurely pleasure of
reading. In it will appear news of
the world of books and periodicals.
No attempt will-be made to mention
-every book published, but we hope
to say enough about the more in-
teresting of the new books and the
reprints of good things to let you
know whether you want to try them.

 

On the last page of The 1928 Owl
stands a quotation which seems, at
first, to have _no meaning. But if
read several times, out of its care-
ful_phrasing_comes 1 philosophy of

you may reﬁrd it, many oun peo-
ple of sen vity have oun; use-

mances of Poictesme, of Dom Man-
uel, and of Dom Manuel's descend-
ents. Nothing more need be said
to his devotees than that a new
Cabell book, Something About Eve
(McBride, $2.50), is on sale. They
will be headed for the nearest book-
store before reading this far.

To most of us, though, his name
is no more familiar than that, say,
-of Arthur Maclien. As for hasten-
ing to the nearest book-store, we’ll
see. Mr‘. Cabell has been writinﬁ
since I904. His publishers thin
his work important enough to begin
publication this fall of, a deﬁnite
editionfof nineteen volumes, limited-_
to ﬁfl?B'€lX'*-.l1llI1d1'ed. and ninety sets
at a price too costly to print in the
advertisements. Not tovevery author
are awayrdedlimited sets _of dermi-
tive editionns. There must be a
reason- Part of the reason is that
‘James Branch Cabpll writes “per-
fectly of beautiful happenings.”
His philosophy, merel suggested
above, is one that ﬁn s a sympa-
thetic hearing in this day of weary-
ing economic competition, political
scandals, and sign-boards. This is
more of the reason. For first-hand
knowledge no better guide could be
had than this latest volume, Same-
thing About Eve, “a comedy of fig-
leaves.”

Gerald Musgrave was ‘ scratching
away at a chapter in his romance of
his ancestor, Dom Manuel, when
Glaum of the Haunting Eyes ro-
posed to take over his physical. ife.
Glad to escape an embarrassing en-
tanglement with his cousin Evelyn,
Gerald accepted. Out in the dusk
be mounted the silver stallion,
Kalki, and began his journeyin
along a woman-haunted way towar
his agointed goal. He was now
Fair-li‘ ired Hoo, the Helper and
Preserver, the Lord of the Third
Truth, and the‘ Well-belov.ed of the
Heavenly Ones, so the. Princess Eva-
sherah told him, and his appointed
goal was Antan, where go all the
gods in their search‘ for the un-
known. Beautiful women along the
way tried to hold him back-, but
“when a citizen of the United
States of America takes up a pur-
suit . ., sir, he does not shill)?’
shally about it.’.’ Finally, thong ,
Maya’ of the Fair Breasts domesti-
cated him, and he never got to
*Antan. _ _

This story, beautiful and attrac-
tive in itself, is a restatement of
Mr. Cabell’s old philosophy, viewed
from‘ new angl;s a_nd with new
clearness. Unlike some of its pre-
decessors—-The Silver Stallion or
The Cream of the Jest, for instance
-—it is obvious enough tobe read
easily, and still subtle enough to
provide enjoyment for alert readers.

Mr. Editor: -

So the outrage continues! Again
the frosh parade with their '
rolled over their knees and their
coats on backwards, and Student
Council waves its feeble arms in pro-
test. It has become ridiculous, this
idea of supblanting “-Agony Day”
with the“ more genteel methods of
letting the fresh live‘up to regula-
tions made by a certain “rah, rah!”
group. Why force‘ the frosh to wear
diiiks and black ties-——the odious sign
of sophomore domination—-while the
sophs are restrained ( ?) by a certain
well known pact from carrying out
their side of the age-old’ custom?

Whither is Pitt heading? The cus-
toms of “Agony Day” if carried to
a reasonable limit inflict no-lastinlgn
mental torture. In reality that fros
parade provided amusement for both
club-yielder and victim. If, college
life is like what we read in The
Panther, why not give the frosh
many opportunities to learn to capti-
vate and propose to sundry co-eds?
"Why not include “uke” lessons in
the program of _“Agony Day”? At
least a frosh learns more about his
fellow students in that parade than
he ever will in class. As for as one
frosh is concerned, that parade was
highly amusing and not such ii. seri-

4 Skippy is gone. Some managing editor,

. in his all-seeing‘ wisdom, took away our

little child, and substituted the Gumps.
We have nothing against the Gumps, but
the fact remains -that Skippy is no longer
withus. And in our hour of almost in-
consolable grief, when gray dawn follows
gray, we ponder on the glory that was

more than Greece, and the grandeur
greater than Rome. To know him was to
love him, but you had to know him. We
once spent an hour trying to convince a
friend from the Middle West that Skippy
was of the immortals, and failed, dismally.
We know now that there was more here
than meets the eye.

Skippy, if you can, go the biological
metamorphosis, was Lilith, who in turn
was and is the mother of all living. "Skippy
was (we speak of him in the past tense,
knowing full well that he lives on happier
comic pages far, far away) as old as Nine-
veh and Babylon which were destroyed, as
old as Tyre which was punctured. Skippy
was as young as silk stockings rolled two
inches below the knee, as young as the first
mustache on a freshman. His quaint little
head was packed with all the wisdom and
philosophy of the ages. Of shoes, and
ships and sealing wax, of cabbages and
kings; of why the sea isboiling hot, and
whether pigs have wings. . .Of all these
Skippy spoke. and for one person at least
he spoke with shrewdness and with love.

It is bitter, now, to think of those late
summer evenings when we would stand in
line at the corner drug-store waiting’ for
the bull-dog edition. Just as the ﬂowers
in the morning turn their curly little heads
every morning to the sun, just as the
thrush and the lark greet each new morn,

with a wild paen of song, so each day,.,'.
brought Skippy, and each day a new facet‘

of his many-sided character was revealed-.
Skippy on a pogo-stick, bouncing hither
-and you like a wood-bird wild, and
bouncing right through a plate-glass drug-
store window, to greet the petriﬁed owner
with a request for “a-a-t-two cent
stamp, please.” Skippy philosophizing on
love, of which you have “only as
much as your hands can hold, and then
you don’t— know that you have it, except
that it’s there." Skippy whistling the

This department is completely fed ‘up on
so-called “collegiate” movies. There has

_b_een a plethora of them lately, and each

one is worse than its predecessor. Good

grief! Do college students spend all their

time changing from ﬂannels. to dinner
jackets, and hopping out of super-motor
boats into super sixes? A friend (unusual
for the fact that he sells bonds_ yet never
went to college) was with us at one of
these cheeses the other night, and at the
end of it turned and asked, “Say, don't
you birds ever go,’ to‘class at school?"

Now, the new year reviving old desires,
and all that sort of thing. A. bunch of
sophs rounded up a bunchof frosh, and
took them out for the traditional parade.
Which is quite according to Hoyle. And
here The Pitt Weekly comes out with a.
“Whither Are We Drifting?“ editorial,
condemning the whole business". The
trouble with. that sort‘ of thing -is that
Weekly can't see beyond its nose. For no
one enjoyed thatparade more than the
frosh themselves. If they hadn't gotten‘ it
they would have felt cheated. Most.‘ of
them turned coats inside out of their own
accord, and pulled up trouser legs above
the knee whenever they began to slip. _

Our attitude toward frosh is to let them
enjoy themselves. If their idea of a good
time is to march around like a bunch of
jackasses, let ’em go to it.’ If they want
to wear boudoir caps instead of-dinks, they
should. But why get all hot and bothered
about it? ‘Surely the student bodypis get-
ting fed up on this everlasting ding-dong
about frosh’ regulations. If Weekly» feels
like reforming, we can think of lots more
beneﬁcial reforms. How about a cinder‘
path up_ to the etude entrance of the sta-

~ dium? Why not a move. to have the caf.‘

open at night, so we can all have a place
to hang out at night? Or any’ othercof
lots of things. ‘But please, Mr. Editor,

An Incident .

It was nearly midnight when my train stopped for a moment at
Woods Run. Beyond the shining- tracks the blue light of a street"
lamp gleained on the wall of a shop and on the hulks of cranes and
scrap iron looming black against the red sky above the blast fur-
naces. Sudden gusts of rain dimmed the lamp and shot swirling
poolé of water across the gray pavements. From the shadow of a
building, suddenly, a man lurched. He stumbled, fell- headlong, and
sprawled on the gleaming sidewalk, his upturned face livid in the
blue haze.

Remembered Things -
I remember things‘; events and thoughts and dreams of my child-
hood, half-forgotten and fragmentary. Often‘ they‘. come back tome
_ like a time once heard, but never recalled in its entirety, just a mea-
-sure or it melody there. I remember the‘ time when I was in the
- second grade and played hockey. Not alone did, I tread the wicked
Pith. but Iinanaged to persuade a playmate of mine, whose name or
face I no longer remember, to spend her penny with mine. I Together’
we sneaked into our house and upstsirsinto my ‘bedroom, in hiding,
_until my sister, with whom I shared, the room, discovered us. We
must have been punished very seyerely, butthat I have forgotten--—_—--
:I only remember that when I was in the second grade, I played hookey.
«This next incident I recall with peculiar cleerness. .In itself it is a
. matter of the most trivial ‘importance, but I mention it because it is
the one clear thing that _I,re_men_iber of my ﬂrst grade. I must have

Senior Mentor System

 

To aid freshman girls in their
difficulties during the year, MISS

‘ Thyrsa W. Amos, dean_ of women,

has‘ installed the senior mentor sys-
tem‘. ' ‘

_ The ‘system is not entirely new,
sa'ys,'Dean Amos, as there has al-
ways been student advisors for
This year, how-
ever, the arrangement’ has been
more formal. Twenty-seven senior
girls have taken char e of _the fresh-
man girls, and. wil assist these
newcomers "to meet the» problems
that may arise during their. first
year of college life. Each _mentor
has from eight -to ten freshmen un-
der her care. One‘ of the purposes
of the system is to give the fresh-
men ’-the viewpoint of the more ma-
ture' student, the new student thus

-- coming into closer, contact with the
- experienced people other than the
‘ » faculty, thereby orienting herself‘ to

her new surroundings.

The senior co-eds acting as men-
tors are: Anaruth Baer, Connells‘-

Calendar For Year Made
Up In Y. M. C. A. Handbook

A‘ calendar for the year has been
made up in the blue book of Frosh

 

published each fall by Y. M. C. A.
Everything from cartoons, a map
of the hillside to 3. picture of the
-Cathedral of Learning, is crammed
between the covers ‘of this pocket
dictionary of student life.

After the’ ﬁrs‘. section of this
year’s volume, comprising general
information: a campus directory, a
calendar, a list of churches, and
facts about honors courses, prizes,
employment, and housing," there fol-
lows a discussion on the value of ac-
tivities as a.» whole and _of each ac-
tivity in particular. '
I Then comes information about the
,place ‘of fraternities in the life of
la University, and an index of fra-
g ternities on the Pitt campus. -A di-
irectory and a record of Pitt sports
prefaced by the text of the songs
and yells concludes the handbook.

Nearly eighteen thousand copies
of the handbook have been distrib-
uted 'in its twenty-two years of ex-
istence, estimates A. K. Van Tine
executive secretary of the “Y.” Last
year, although 2,000,-copies of the
book were issued’, this was not Suﬁ‘:-

e..quette, the Freshman Handbook,

cient to meet the. demands. This
year. 2,500 were printed. Each
freshman at registration receives
a free copy of the handbook; they
are sold to upperclassmen.

Any freshman who has not re-
ceivedhis copy of this vest pocket
encyclopedia of University life can
get one at the “Y” hut by showing
his registration card.

Members of the staff of the
handbook are Harold A. Johnston.
Pittsburgh, Med. ’31, editor and
manager; Niles Anderson, La Porte,
Ind., Col. '29; Paul McClain, Pitts-
burgh, Med. ’31;. Robert Roy, Juni-
ata, Col. 29; Frank Troup, Pitts-
burgh, Col. ’28, and“ Leonard Solo-
mon, Beaver Falls, Bus. Ad. ’30, as-
sistants.

in history. Greatlwealth is’ being
accumulated here, he stated, that in
turn opens up the opportunities for
leisure and the development of the
creative faculties of the country,
that will be turned not only to the
field of arts and sciences, but to the

world of business as well.

Chancellor‘ Bownman Notes A

The ﬁrst lap of the tour took the
party of three across the country"
to the Paciﬁc“ coast. From San
Francisco, they sailed for “Hono-
lulu 1n_the Hawaiian Islands‘. the
Samoa islands, and the Fiji islands
where they spent a short time for
a motor trip. They next headed for
Au_stral_ia, and in Sydney -visited the
university. ' ..

_A small Dutch ship then _ car-
ried them North by way of the
Coral‘Sea ‘and the Arafura ‘Sea, a
route over which there is but little
trafﬁc. Short stops were‘ made at

Macassar on the island of Celebes ,

and Sarabaya on the island of "
Java, through which they traveled
by automobile, to Batavia, a dis-
tance of one thousand miles.

Singapore, Sumatra. and Sahong
were visited after which th'e..tour-
ists started the journey ‘home by.
crossing the Red Sea and southern
E rope, ﬁnally reaching Genoa,
Italy.

The trip north across Europe
required several more days. Pro-
fessor Hunt then parted from
Chancellor Bowman and his son to
s and some time in France. The
c ancellor crossed the channel‘ into
England where he spent considera-
ble time in his visits to the English

7  d ‘Hood Star. Passer

The onlyl sure thing on the frosh .
team is the phenomenal forward .

passing of Franklin Hood, former
Monaca High and Bellefonte Acad-
emy star fullback. Hood is without
doubt the greatest passer in the
country- He consisently hurls the
L ball 60 yards and frequently sends
3??-yard spiral spinmng down the
e . ’
William Loehr, a Wyoming Sem-
inary product, is a promising end
candidate. He is a good defensive
man and goes down fast under
passes and punts. . '
 Ernest Lewis, stocky little guard,
.who starred on Steelton High school
teams, is developing into_ a_ fair line
prospect, and Walter Milhgan, last
yea._r’s Kiski captain and center, IS a
good pivot man.
. Other Candidates —
Other promising candidates include
Walinchus, back; Tully, . tackle;
Greenberger, tackle; Williams, back
and Crissinger, tackle. Coach Carl-
son, has not had suﬁicient time to
know the possibilitiesof his squad
but it is sure to be a well-drilled ag-
gregation under his tutelage. ‘

SIXTEEN ORUNNERSL V
 REPORT TO SHEA
Cross Country Coach Has
Sixteen Veterans From
' ' Last Year

 

 

. . Sixteen‘ candidates reported for

— Frank ‘Shea’s varsity cross-country
V team lastweek.’ Of this number, six

i_.aLre veterans of last" year.’s_ team,
while the other ten are new men.‘ s
L The experienced men who are out
for the Pitt cross-country team are:
‘Captain Wood Adams,--Robby Roy,
James..Davis, Alex Campbell, Seig
Larson and William Grossett. Others
who arecandidates for the varsity-
harrier outﬁt are: William Widdow-5
son, Edward Blistein, .H. E. Troup,:
M. Spellman, William McGill, 
D. \*KeLnnedy, .Mau1ricc Kaufman,
James Jerpe, Robert Burton, Wil-
liam Wherry, James ‘Davis, George
Allebrand and Russell- Comfort.
Comfort, Wherry, Jerpe and Stewart
'wereVmembers of last year’s cham-
pionshipe freshmen hill-aLnd—dale club.
L.Bobby Marquis, Pitt’s ‘first man
last season, who had one more eli-
V gible year. of cross—country, has not
returned to school, and according to
Shea, this will greatly hurt the
Panther’s chances of putting a good
team on the, courses. Marquis was
‘slated as the Blue and Gold’s ﬂeetest
daler. .

Shea, has the problem of forming
this bunch, of mediocre runners into
‘a. team that can lick Carnegie Tech,
Syracuseandi Penn State on succes-
sive Saturdays, and then two weeks
later, to have a squad of harriers
that will be able to uphold the rec-
-ord that other Pitt teams have estab-
-lished in‘ the intercollegiate cross-
-country championships. V

Carnegie Tech, the Golden Panth-
er’s opponent on Saturday, October
22, has a team of veterans, the .same
‘ men who beat the‘ Pitt harriers last
season. -Captain C.rawford,.the Car-
negie star, will be hard for the Pitt
runners to beat. Last year, the only
