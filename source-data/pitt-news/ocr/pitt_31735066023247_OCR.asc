Bill Madlock ripped four hits and
Tim Foli drove in three runs as the
Pittsburgh Pirates, battling to stay
alive, defeated the Baltimore
Orioles 7-1 Sunday in Game Five of
the 1979 World Series.

' The victory left the Pirates still
trailing_ the best-of-seven Series
3-2 but forced the teams back to
Baltimore for a sixth game Tuesday
night. Game Seven, if needed,
would be played Wednesday night.

The Pirates had hoped to start
Bert Blyleven in Game Six, but that
plan was changed when Manager
Chuck Tanner brought him out of
the bullpen Sunday for his ﬁrst
re-lief appearance since_ 1972.
Blyleven allowed three hits over
the ﬁnal four innings to complete a
six-hitter- Jim Rooker had pitched
the ﬁrst ﬁve innings and left the
game trailing 1-0. '

The \Pirates came up with
two-run innings in the sixth and
seventh to turn the game around.
The catalysts in both rallies were

the slap-hitting Foli‘ and slugger]
Dave Parker.

Then Pittsburgh sealed the
victory with a three-run eighth built
around Madlock’s fourth single of
the\ game and a bases-loaded,
two-out two-run single by Foli.

Mike Flanagan, winner of Game
One in this Series, had the Pirates
shut out over the first ﬁve innings
and was leading 1-0 on a run the
Orioles scratched off Rooker in the
ﬁfth.

Foli opened the Pittsburgh sixth
with a walk on a 3-1 pitch.
Parker, who had struck out in each
of his ﬁrst two at’-bats Sunday,
followed with a single to center.

With the Three Rivers Stadium
crowd of 50,920 chanting “Let’s Go

Bucs!” Tanner had cleanup batter
Bill Robinson bunt the runners
along. It was an interesting
strategy move because earlier in
the Series Baltimore Manager Earl
Weaver hadsuggested that bunt-
ing might not be such a good idea

because it means your team is:

playing for a single run. But the
Pirates got two this time.

Willie Stargell lifted one of his

patented rainbow ﬂy balls to center

ﬁeld. Al Bumbry settled under it
easily. ‘but Foli ‘scored after‘ the
catch,‘ tying the game 1-1. Parker

moved to third on the play and-

came home a moment later when
Madlock muscled his third of four
singles in the game—this one into

‘ center ﬁeld.

With the Pirates ‘in front,
Baltimore tried to play catch-up
baseball—an Orioles specialty all
season. But the Bucs weren’t

yielding.

After Blyleven retired the ﬁrs
two hitters in the seventh, catcher
Rick Dempsey hustled a routine hit
into a double.

Now Weaver went to his bench,
which has been so successful
throughout the Series. Pat Kelly
was sent up to bat for Flanagan and
Blyleven responded by striking him
out on a 2-2 pitch’.

Quickly, the Bucs went about the
work of adding to their lead in the
seventh. Garner opened with a
bouncer to shortstop that took. a
huge hop off the artiﬁcial surface
inﬁeld and went for a single.

Blyleven tried to sacriﬁce, but ''

forced Garner at second. Then
shortstop ~Koko Garcia made a
brilliant stop on Omar Moreno’s
shot up the middle and turned in
into another forced play.

Now Moreno began a cat-and-

mouse game with relief pitcher Tim
Stoddard, who was obvously
concerned about the ﬂeet Pirate’s
speed. Stoddard threw over to first
base three time while working to
Foli. The’ fourth throw, however,

got away and Moreno reached ‘'

second on the pitcher’s error.

That was the break the Pirates ,

needed. Foli riﬂed. the next pitch
up the gap in right-center ﬁeld,
scoring Moreno to make it 3-1.
Left-hander Tippy Martinez rel-
ieved for Baltimore and Parker
upset that strategy with a (iouble
for another Pirates run.

Pittsburgh added to it cushion in ,

the eighth inning after Stargell and
Madlock opened with singles:
It was Madlock’s fourth hit of the
game, making him the third player
in this Series to tie
single-game record and the 39th in

’ MIAMI——With two large blocks
of votes still to be counted,
President Carter held a statewide
lead yesterday over Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy in Florida’s Demo-
cratic Party caucuses and Carter

L tbackers claimed victory in the first

balloting of the 1980 presidential
campaign.

a ‘But while Carter, whose cam-

paign was supported by the

Still to be tallied were ballotsefor
188 delegates in populous Dade
County, which includes Miami, and
for 60 delegates in Palm Beach
County. Party ‘officials said a ﬁnal
delegate count might not be

"available for severaldays. A

The turnout in Dade, where it,

rained throughout the day, was
disappointing and an unofﬁcial poll
of voters found a slim plurality
saying they supported the Carter
slate. The voter survey found 1,727
saying they backed Carter, 1,672
supporting Kennedy, 688 for the
labor slate, and 187 uncommitted

Saturday where he was campaign-

On Oct. 6, Blume, 36, died in bed
in his shabby west Philadelphia‘
apartment. He was 6 feet tall and
weighed 87 pounds. p -
Haasz said his student was frail
but healthy and died through
overexertion, « rupturing a lung
during a yoga-breating exercise.
But Dr. Robert Catherman, the
city’s deputy medical examiner,
said Blume,‘ once muscular and
athletic, starved himself to death.
“It's very simple,” Catherman
explained. “He was tremendously

malnourished, and he developed
pneumonia. But without the

developed pneumonia. He looked"

showed no evidence of a burst

Said his friend Michelle Murphy:
“He was a scholar, and he followed
everything he studied down to the
last footnote. He was so thorough.

So when he got into this, he p

thoroughly killed himself.”

s

administration. ,Although Thornburgh presented

himself as a moderate whose only promise was to end
the corruption characteristic of Milton Shapp’s
Democratic reign, the governor now is consolidating
his cabinet into a consensual body to carry out his
recently announced conservative goals.

Health Secretary Gordon MacLeod was obviously
unable to fit into this type of cabinet because of his
attempts to include different health services handled
by other departments into the functions of the state
Health Department and the resultant clashes with
Welfare Secretary Helen O’Bannon

Jones. Thornburgh himself admitted these were the

. reasons for requesting MacLeod’s resignation. '

“Dr. MacLeod has been an agressive advocate for

his points of view,’/‘ said Thornburgh. Unfortunate- _

ly, the unwillingnessor inability on the part ‘of
Dr. MacLeod to appreciate conflicting points
of view has led to considerable friction with fellow
cabinet members and others in the administration.”

' ‘With the departure of MacLeod and Joseph,

Thornburgh can concentrate on passage of his new
legislative package, which includes the abolition of

parole in Pennsylvania and the usdal conservative .
proposal that welfare recipients be forced to work-‘

More important than its content is the package’s
tone, which is a turn from Thornburgh’s moderate
campaign rhetoric toward more conservative

demagoguery. The reasons for Thornburgh’s
conservative outburst, which is amazingly similar to
proposals on welfare reform by Republican faithful
Raymond Shafer, is the governor’s realization of the

._ problems he faces within Pennsylvania’s Republican

Party. First making his reputation as the U.S.
Attorney in aPitts-burgh under the Ford
administration, Thornburgh used this edge and the
support of Elsie Hillman to win the Republican

' primary. Thornburgh must now make firmer ties

with all segments of the GOP in Pennsylvania if he is
to be a successful governor, and stands like work
requirements for welfare recipients and the abolition

.of parole are positions that should warm the hearts

of the faithful Republican Party.‘

'Thornburgh’s turn to the right also aligns him with
the current conservative sentiment that is now’at a
peak in the country. If he is successful in convincing
the state legislature to accepthis reforms, he could
make himself as well known in conservative circles as
Ronald Reagan or Philip Crane—a position that
could make him a prime bidder for a Senate seat or a
vice-presidential nomination. The crucial point is
still _the OK.‘ from the legislature, which ,-is
questionable since the Republicans hold a slight edge
in the state Senate and the Democrats have a
minority “of one in the Assembly. With those odds
the governor is going to have to fight a tough battle
before he sees his reforms enacted.

The departed always had a reflective

knew the departed always understood
that questions of societal concern seemed
to weigh heavy on him. Tolstoy’s Prince

know the departed when in the story he
remarked, "‘the heaviest burden to

thought this nature was responsible for

By SAMUEL SCIULLO~‘

Pitt News Staff Writer
‘Pitt, fresh off Saturday morn-

, ing’s 35-0 whitewashing of a

completely inept University of

Cincinnati team, will have a full .

head of steam entering this
Saturday’s game against fellow
Top 20 team Washington.

For the second time this season,
the Pitt offense was very impres-
sive running up 502 total yards-
234.on the ground and 268 through
the air. ’

Both quarterbacks were impres-
sive. Rick Trocano, who played
three quarters, led the Panthers to
three touchdowns, hitting on 11 of
17 passes for 147 yards and one
touchdown. Dan Mari.no led the
way in the fourth quarter,

' completing 11 of 16.for 121 yards
and a touchdown strike to wide ’

' receiver Ralph Still.

After the game, Pitt Coach
Jackie Sherrill intimated he expect-
ed big things from his offensive
unit.

“Before the game, I said to our
coache‘s,‘Let’s get ﬁve or six
hundred total yards, Let’s make
something happen,” said Sherrill.

“We’re getting more consis-
tent,” he added.

The Panther running attack also
made things happen. On the first
series of the game, Randy
McMillan seemed to be running at
will against the undersized, over-
matched Bearcat defensive line.
The initial. drive was thwarted
when Big Mac fumbled on the
one-,yard line, but it really didn’t
matter, so evident was Pitt’s

. superiority.

Rooster Jones, making his first
start since last season, had another
good day, carrying the ball for 54
‘yards on 10 attempts.

Another halfback, Artrell Haw.-_

kins, shone brightly in limited
action, gaining 32 yards on only
four carries. Hawkins, a junior
from Johnsto_wn,‘seems to be Pitt’s
intelligent halfback, with
good open field running ability, but

doesn’t seem to receive the
opportunities Jones and Fred
Jacobs get.

Sherrill also got a charge from
his defense, which came up with its

second ' shutout of the season.

“Again, I thought ,the defense
played extremely well,” he said.
He pointed out the great’ effort
made in the fourth quarter when
the Bearcats had a first-and-goal
from Pitt’s four yard line. The
stand was set up after JoJo Heath
make a great one-on-one effort to
stop ﬂanker Aaron H'agans after
the Bearcat had taken a pass from

' Tony Kapetanis, andlappeared to

be on his way to a shutout stopping
touchdown.

Just where do the Panthers stand . 

entering the middle game of the
season? I

With a 4-1 record, Pitt could
advance to the 14th or 15th spots in
the polls, although the polls are
relatively meaningless at this point.
of the season.

Washington was a 12-7 upset
loser at Arizona State two nights

0 ago, and that stands to take some

of the glitter off the game. But it is
one of the few chances Pitt will
have to beat a good team this year,
so incentive should be no problem.
The game is also on television,
which should give the players an
opportunity to show off in front of
the cameras. '
The Panthers are now in almost
as ‘identical a position as they were
entering the road game at North
Carolina. Coming off ail impres-
sive offensive performance against
a poor opponent, confidence and
enthusiasm are at a peak.‘ Now is
the time for the Pitt football team to
go out and prove itself against a
better than mediocre team. A win
would certainly silence the critics
(who, me?) who say that Jackie

, Sherrill, Rick Trocano and company

can't beat the good teams, and that
their personal records have been
cushioned againsy a bevy‘ of lousy
teams. V.

  Panther Offense on the Mov/e...It's About Time!

the attitude in the stands asfthe Pitt offense finally
put it all together and walloped Cincinnati 35-0. Led
by Rick Trocano, who had his best game to date, and
Dan Marino, the Panther offense finally took some
pressure off. the defense and played up to its
potential. With the Huskies of Washington next on
the slate, the offense showed good timing _in breaking
out of its scoring slump.

Apart from a fumble by Randy MacMillan on the ‘

opening drive the Panthers played mistake-free
Afootball, something they have not done in a while.
Without the turnovers, the Panthers were able to
move the ball on smaller Bearcats and gave their best
showing of ‘the year. ‘

It had to be a satisfying performance for Trocano
'who quieted critics by coming up with a clutch

performance when he needed it most. It must be a ,

confidence builder for the junior from Ohio who has
 subject to undue criticism by the fans and, the
press. ‘

Commenting on the negativism of the crowd,
Trocano said, “I play for the University of
Pittsburgh, but sometimes it just doesn't feel that
way. It hurts me because I’m representing the
students and they show it by booing me.”

On the offense, Trocano seemed pleased. “The
key today was that we didn’t beat ourselves, that’s

.. really been our problemg but I feel that today's
_‘ V. performance is an indication of things to come.” V

Pep Talk  
A BiyAMIN GHOSSEIN ’

When asked about his roommate (Marino) and his
competition, Trocano said, “I’d love to play the
whole game, but it’s the coach that decides. I don’t
really pay too much attention to what other people
say. The important thing is that we won.”

The mood in the locker room was subdued elation.
Not to take anything away from Cincinnati, but the
players realized that a win was in order and the real
test would be next week. The players will come into
Seattle with a sort of quiet confidence.

One of the major reasons for the win was the play
of the offensive line, which opened upgaping holes
to the delight of “Big Mac and Co.” The unit has
been plagued in recent games by penalties and has
not been a cohesive group but this game proved
different. ’

Dan Fidler, the starting left guard and possibly the
most consistent lineman summed it up after the
game, “The offense feels bad because we haven’t
performed up to par. Mistakes have really been the
problem whether they. be fumbles or. penalties. We
blocked better today but we. could still .improve.”,

 

. When asked. why. the quarterbacks put the ball 

so much when the run was clicking, the senior from
Arizona answered, “We knew we could run on them
all day so we wanted to open it up, a little.
Washington is going to be tougher so the pass will be
important because it will be harder to establish a
running game.” » c

Fidler, who was the captain for the game, realizes.’
that this game should not get the team overconfident.’

“We are still not where we want to be at this point
in the season but we’re coming “along,” Fidler said.
“We know how good Washington is and will play
accordingly. I still feel that we should have scored
more against Boston College and Kansas, but we’ll
be ready for Washington.” ’

Yes, this wasan impressive performance by the
offense, which is welcome to the defensive players.
One must not, however, -lose sight of the fact that
once again the Panther opponent was unimpressive
and didn’t offer much resistance. For Rick Trocano
it was needed to silence his critics for at least one

. week. -

The Washington game will be tough. Don’t expect

any blowouts due to ‘the outstanding defenses -on‘

both sides. For the Panthers, this game is -an
important step in their quest of a bowl bid. A win

Panfhereﬂe Spikers Back from Deep   in the Heortof   rexas   

By JEFF DUROSKO
Asst. Pitt News Sports Editor

After two straight tournament
wins, the Pitt women’s volleyball
team went 3-3 last weekend and
placed seventh at the Houston
Invitational. The Pantherettes also
lost a dual match to the University
of Houston Thursday night.

Against Houston, Pitt was facing
the ninth-ranked team in the
country and head coach Mike
Hebert said that after playing the

'* Cougars, they deserve their rank-

ing. Pitt lost the match 2-0 by
scores of 15-10, 15-8. '

In thetournament, Pitt started
out pool play against Baylor and
were defeated 2-1. The Panther-
ettes won the ﬁrst game easily

15-3, but Baylor just caught ﬁre in
games two and three to beat Pitt
15-5, 15-6.

“I’d have to call this match an
upset,” said Hebert. “I guess we
just looked past them a little bit and
they took advantage of it.”

After this loss, Pitt had to win all
three of its remaining games in its
pool to advance into championship
play.

Pitt’s next opponent was Texas
A&M who ﬁnished eighth in the
country last season. The Panther-
ettes handled A&M easily by
crushing the Aggies 15-8, 15-7.

Illinois State provided the next
competition and Pitt won a tough
first game 17-15 and then were
overwhelmed in the second game

15-3. In the rubber game of the
match, Pitt defeated State 15-10.

“We still weren't playing real
well all day,” said Hebert, “but we
were still 2-0 and I can’t complain
about that.”

In the match which decided if
Pitt would advance into champion-
ship play, the Pantherettes played
Oral Roberts and easily won the
match 15-7, 15-8. Pitt ﬁnished
second in the pool to Oral Roberts
because of the pool records and
because of this Pitt had to face the
University of Houston in the first
round of the playoffs. '

Pitt played Houston tough
throughout the match, according to
‘Hebert and actually won the ﬁrst
game 15-11. After that, it was all

the 76-year history of the Series to

' do it.

After Steve Nicosia fouled out,
Garner drilled an RBI single to left.
It was Garner’s second hit of the
game and ninth of the Series, and
kept his batting average ‘at .500 for
‘five games. I

A Blyleven bunted the runners up
and Moreno got ‘ an intentional
walk, loading the bases. That
brought up Foli and, with the
crowd chanting his name, he
bounced a single up the middle to
drive in two more runs and turn the
game into a rout. —

Rooker, the 37-year-old left-
hander who had spent eight weeks

on the disabled list this season, _

pitched brilliantly at the start,
matching ’ Flanagan inning for
inning. He retired the first‘10
Orioles and did not allow a hit until
the ﬁfth. '
But Baltimore got on the
scoreboard in that inning when
Gary Roenicke opened with a

double and Doug DeCinces fol-’

lowed with a single, sending
Roenicke to third. The, Pirates
played their infield‘ back, conceding
the run to get the double play.

Rich Dauer obliged’ with the
grounder Pittsburgh needed for the
double play as Roenicke scored’ the
game’s ﬁrst run. It also turned out
to be Baltimore’s last one.

The game began on a somber
note with a moment of silence in
memory of two members of the
Pittsburgh family who died over
the weekend. Ann Tanner, mother
of Pirates Manager Chuck Tanner,
died Sunday morning at age 70.
Edgar Speer, a director of the club
and former board chairman of
United States Steel, died Saturday.

It ended in a burst of ﬁreworks as
hundreds of fans flocked over the

-field, celebrating the victory.

The fans milled around, jumping
and cheering as the loudspeaker
system pumped out the team’s
theme song, “We Are Family.”

game two 15-7 and game three
15-10. Although the score in the
third game was 15-10, Hebert said
it was a much closer game than the
score showed.

With the Pantherettes out of the
hunt for the title, four southwes-
tern teams (three from Texas) took
the top spots in the tournament.
Lamar University was ﬁrst with
Houston second, Texas third and
Oral Roberts fourth. ,

‘-‘There is a team that we crushed
(Oral Roberts),” said Hebert, ‘.‘and
they ﬁnish fourth just because of
the bracket in which they played.”

Pitt entered consolation play
with a chance to place as high as
ﬁfth. The Pantherette’s ﬁrst match
was with defending champion
Texas-Arlington who had been
upset in the quarterﬁnals.

In a close, tough‘ match, the
Pantherettes lostto Arlington two
games to one. After getting
pounded in the ﬁrst game 15-7, Pitt
came back to win game two by
15-12, but couldn't overcome
Arlington in game three, losing

Captain Cindy Chambers was 
named to the. seven member

all-tournament team which Hebert

called a surprise and a great honor.»

“The ﬁeld of this tournament
was even stronger than last year,”
he said. “And I would say that the

competition was actually compar-

able to that of the San Diego tourn-
ment.” '
Hebert laudedthe play of Andra
Pletz and freshman Robin Kuklais
whom he said came on strong at the
end of the invitational
Arlington and Houston.
“We’re so much stronger than

last year that there really isn’t any ’

comparison,” said Hebert. “All
the players have told me how much

they’ve learned through the com? '

petition we’ve faced.’ ’

‘The Pitt stickwomen overcame
the rain and mud in New
Wilmington to score an impressive
4-0 victory over Westminster
College. The win boosted the
Pantherettes’ overall record to 3-3.

V The game was played mostly in
the Westminster backfield, as the
Pitt goalie only touched the ball
once in the entire 70 minutes.
Team captain Dee Dee Kantner
was the first to score. Eight
into the match, she

Pantherettes could not score in the
remainder of the first half, and the
score stood at 1-0 at halftime.

It took only five minutes for Jean
Shelly to slap in a shot for the first ,
score of the second half. Margie
Hall came back with the first of her
two goals with six-and-a-half
minutes remaining. To add insult

Mid, Westmnster, 4-0

to injury, Hall again scored on an
overpowering shot four minutes
later, making the final score 4-0.

“It felt good to score that many
goals, and we probably would have
scored more if the weather had
cooperated. As it was, the girls
had a rough time keeping their
footing,” said coach Audrey
Gerginski.

Gerginski was pleased with the
play of those who did not score.
This time it was Sue Shaheen who
provided constant feeds from the
right side of the line.

Slippery Rock, whom Pitt defeat-
ed ?.-1 in the Slippery Rock
Invitational, will be here on
October 19 for a match on the Trees
Field.

“We can't take them for granted

because we beat them once already

this year,” said Gerginski. “They
have always given us a good
match.”
