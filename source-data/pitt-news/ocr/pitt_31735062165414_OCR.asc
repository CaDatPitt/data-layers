i C,o_-Ed. Hits . Swetonic's
Freshman ABC's

_Editor, The Pitt News:
. Re: Column by Matt Swetonic -
Sept. 5, 1962."

What happened to’ intelligent,
thoughtful journalism? Why
does "a supposed representative
i0'f,the student body feel a need
to defame and condemn life in
_~the University to its new mem-
-bers before they are able to
form their own opinions?
Upper-classmen,_perhaps, are
aware of the faults and weak-
nesses _of our Administration
‘and the foibles to which a fresh-
‘man’ may fall prey, However, the
columnist who so blatantly
blasted University life in the

medium of communication, al-

so served to demonstrate his
own immaturity as an editorial-
izer.

Free expression is the basis of
the press. I hardly am condon-
ing a paper Tvhich can only
white-wash the deeds of its Uni-
versity and whose writers must
be afraid to voice their opin-
ions. I only wish to say that
some restraint ‘is always ap-
'propriate. The cliche- which
‘states, “think before you speak,”
does make good sense. '

Our freshmanewill have time
to learn for themselves both the
bad and the good points about
the University. Perhaps we
should allow the good to be pre-

Grade; Descriptions

(Editor’s note: the following"
is a copy of are letter recently
sent to Assistant Chancellor

Edison Montgomery. It is re- C

printed herein the belief that
it is of interest to the student
body. -

Mr. Edison Montgomery
Assistant Chancellor .- Planning
University of Pittsburgh,
Pittsburgh 13, Pa.
Dear Sir: I

The registration kit which I
received today (August 21) for
the forthcoming trimester in-
cludes »a letter over your sig-
nature block pertaining to the
grading system at the Univer-
sity. _

Under the heading Quality
Grades, the grade of “C” is de-
scribed as “‘minimum_ satisfac-

tory, work.” Describing a “C” _

grade in this manner impressed
me as giving it an undesirable
connotation, and I am _sure other
students and anyone not con-
nected -with the‘ "University
would gain the same impression.

The former designation of a
“C” grade as indicating ”aver-
age attainment” was, to me, a
far better description 01 what
a “C” grade actually is.

The academic superstructure
of the University no doubt gave
serious consideration
matter before changing the
grade description, but I hope

they will reconsider the matter-

and_ that other students will pro-

test this description which I be- '

lieve to be improper.
Sincerely,
Louis J. Cain

“Yeah. Stan? What’s up?”

“I just called to ﬁnd out if the room had been
cleaned up yet. What’s the story?”

“Well, they’re still working
on it. We’ve been having a bit
of trouble.”

“Trouble? What kind
trouble? And who’s they?”

“There are two c l e a n i n g
women up hereinow, but one of
them is just_sitting in the middle
of the room — crying. In fact
she’s hysterical. She just sits
there sobbing ‘Why me?’ over
and over again. I tell ya’ it’s
unnerving, man.”

‘-‘Well, where’s the other one? Can’t she do
anything?”

“She went into the closet to dust it out half an
hour‘ ago and I haven’t seen her since. I looked in
a while ago but I couldn’t see anything.’ Frankly,
I’m’afraid to go in" thereby myself. You remember
what happened to Mike last_month. Cripes, he was

under that pile of clothes in the corner yet?”
“N-no, not yet. But, goodgrief, pal, that’s a

some of the pants off the top by myselfand stand
them up in the corner to soften them up, but when‘
I get down beneath the ﬁrst layer‘~I’d need some

“Wonderful, Wonderful Copenhagen” — the
words of ‘the ‘song kept spinning crazily through
my head as I took my ﬁrst steps on'Danish ‘soil. A

Ahead of me lay the “beautiful maid of the sea”
and my ﬁrst encounter‘ with a
foreign language. ‘

Number one problem to be
tackled, ﬁnding a- place -A to stay.

I was traveling with one suit-
case, a very limited number of
travelers checques, and the stu-
dents Bible in the form ‘of a
small yellow handbook of hostels
published by the Irfternational
Student Travel Service.

There are youth -hostels and
student hostels. The former are
primarily for hikers or ‘cyclists.’ They allow a max‘-
imum stay of three nights, and include, curfews
and, a schedule of light chores for residents. This
last requirement enables these establishments. to
offer the average fee of 35 cents per night.

Student Hostels are more relaxed in atmos-
phere, drawing almost entirely college students
and have no hoursor duties and usually include
breakfast in the 90 cent nightly charge.
Available Hostels 2

Consulting my guide for those hostels available
in Copenhagen, I found only one listed in the
city. .

A short ride on a trolley and I reached my-
destination.

-3

Tired, and hungry after my 26-hour trip from
England, visions of pillows danced in my head. No
such luck.

After checking in and paying 96 cents for the
ﬁrst night, I stuckup a conversation with some
bearded midwestern Americans,~ fellow hostelers.“
Before I had a chance to mention food, I had ac-
cepted invitations to go “clubbing.” Six Americans,
one German and one Norwegian strong, we set out-
to explore Danish night life.

The Danes love jazz, both the American and
native variety, _and I was treated to some expert
specimens during thecourse of the night.

 

In small, _ smokey clubs,’ bettering the best
Grenwich-Village has to offer, we drank our cold
Tuborg beer and hot, hot jazz. 3

I soon learned I would have to acclimate my-,
self to Copenhagen’s lopsided daytime —- night‘-_

time schedule. In the summer, the sun sets at
11:30_,p.m. and rises at 2:30 a.m. with only one ,_;_
hour of true darkness. And as long as the: light

lasts, .so does the people’s. enthusiasm for jazz,

parties and fun. We were on the move constantly ’
and in five days I couldn’t have gotten more

than eighthours of sleep altogether. -
However, I was informed by Danish friends,
the winter life is"the very antithesis of this sum-
mer gaity. For the many cold months, tlie sun
goes down at 4:30 p.m. and doesn’t ‘show. again"
until 11:30 a.m. This results in,a daily schedule of

just work and sleep. Afterthe winter months or?/37

stagnation, the people joyfully welcome the sun.
Impossible Park a _ , ‘ _
During my second day in Copenhagen, I visited
Tivoli Gardens. A huge “park” encompassing
much of the center of the city, which has no pos-
sible American counterpart. A 15 cents admission

fee allowed my entrance to spreading parks and-

flower gardens interspersed with ponds and walks;
over 20 restaurants with every kind of food and a
complete price range; a towering roller coaster
and every other variety of ride; shooting galleries
and fun houses and even a hot dog stand.  M
While eating lunch, we listened to popular
music from a nearby concert band and afterwards
enjoyed a puppet show. During the evening, -we
heard a jazz concert and.then danced in’ a beauti-

ful ballroom. We even heard the National Sym- .-

phony play a free concert in an accoustically per-

fect concert hall. A colorful and noisy display of .

ﬁreworks made a perfect ﬁnale for the evening.
Language never proved a problem. Almost
everyone spoke English ﬂuently. The warm, friend-
ly welcome of the Danes was what made my stay
there so enjoyable. I hated to l.eave this fairyland, .
for fairyland it was. . A

Review of ‘Scott ‘Fitzgerald’

Biography Neglects

Writer as

a Writer

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

Andrew Turnbull’s ‘recent

biography of Scott Fitzgerald

(Charles Schn'bner"s Sons; 364 pp.;V$5.95) may.best be de-

scribed as a labor of love.

The evident infatuation with the Spokesman of the

‘- Speakeasies began when Fitzgerald rented a section of the

Turnbull estate as a temporary home. Andrew Turnbull was

then a young boy, but from his¢

first meeting with "the popular
_writer, he acquired a devotion to
him which eventually would be
strong enough to motivate him to
methodically construct a biogra-
phy.

Turn-bull has faithfully per-

_¢;..~formed" all of the duties of the

competent biographer. The life
of Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald
—-or, to put it more dramatically
accurate-—the rise and fall of the
writer, was a fascinating life in-
deed. Having researched care-
fully. Turnbull unearthed the suf-
ficient number of details concern-
ing the author’s early life, his
well—known Princeton days, his

/*~. early success as a novelist and

;f3’_ proud,

short-story writer, and the insane
love-affair which ultimately “drove
him to physical and creative ruin.
" Doles Out
Turnbull -doles out anecdotes
-— and observations in_ abundance.
‘With a‘ well—rounded picture of
th.e dashing, I-aim-at—the-stars
.youth'in St. Paul, Minnesota, and
"a equally realistic. View of the
promising Princetonian,
the reader is duly prepared for

the “inside story” of how and why‘

Fitzgerald developed intothe cre-

-ative genius of the twenties and
early thirties. _ ‘

But a probing of the writer

is disturbingly absent. Instead,

Turnbull offers to entertain us

,p__ with three major aspects of
 _Scott’s brief life.
A The best of these is Fitzgerald’s

.courtship and marriage to Ala-
baman Zelda Sayre. Although
eventually committed to psychi-

7,'.atric care, Zelda was an even

match for Fitzgerald’s zest for the
abandon of the Jazz Age. The
couple soon became known as the
wildest of the wild and their an-
tics in New York and‘on the. Con-

-1- tient are close to incredible.

As he lay groaning on the ﬁeld, Marv said he recalled a

On Traficant;

Backs Out

If you go by the usual
statistics, the Panthers should
have the advantage when
they engage Miami on home
grounds in the,nation’s ﬁrst
nationally televised game
this Saturday.

The home team usually deserves
a slight nod, but in this instance
it will practically be a homecom-
ing game for Miami. The Hur-
ricanes, who won seven of 10
games last year, number no less
than 26 players on their roster
who call Pennsylvania home.

The Panthers will be hoping to

record in 1961. A place where they
must show immediate improve-
ment in order to hold their own
with Miami is in the defensive
backﬁeld. ’
Sick Secondary

-The Panther backs let 13 passes
go for touchdowns last year, help-
ing to account for the 209 points
scored against Pitt ‘last year.

Panther fans had better pray-
for another hard rainstorm at
halftime. It saved them last year
in the Orange Bowl when Paul
Martha took a lateral from Fred
Cox in- an 80-yard razzle-
dazzle play‘ in the midst of a
squall to record the winning
points in a 10-7 fluke.
On offense Pitt must depend on
a running attack. Jim Traﬁcant
threw well in spots last year, and
Fred Mazurek_ is a high1y—rated
ﬁll-in, but the end corps is inex-
perienced and of questionable
quality. .
‘ Look Better
Traﬁcant, who missed last fall’s
Miami tussle,‘ has looked "impres-
sive in drills. Coach John Mich-
elosen feels that for this reason
the Panthers are in much better
position to face Miami this time.
“Jim should have a great
year,” he said. “He has,matured

Hail from Area;

Like Homecoming
By STU BERNSTEIN
Almost half‘ of the Univer-
sity -of Miami’s football squad
will it return to _ their home
state this Saturday. Twenty-

seven Hurricanes, including four
Pittsburghers on the starting line,
hail from Pennsylvania.

Miami "center Bob Dental and
tackles Joe Smerdel and Stan
Mulury, alumni of Central Cath-
olic, lead the pack of Pittsburgh
talent that will invade the Stadium
this weekend. James O’Mahony of
neighborhood Schenley High will
also ﬁll a front wall position for
Miami._ '

But it’s not the native boys that
pose ‘the biggest threat to the
_ spirited Panthers. George Mira,
pre-season All-America pick, and
fleet-footed left halfback Nick
Spinelli are a combination that
can give Pitt gridders premature

A Johns Retires

' The Miami backﬁeld is not as
talented as it might have been.
Eddie Johns, Coach Andy Gustaf-
son’s number one right halfback,
recently decided to give up foot-
ball as a result of an injury suf-
fered ' last season. But his suc-
cessor, Van Parsons, has shown
great promise, and cannot be writ-
ten off as a threat to the Panther
defense.

A back who could also see
considerable action against Pitt
this Saturday ‘is John_ Baheii.
Used as a running back as well-
‘as a ﬂanker, Bahen has shown
considerable outside running

ability, probably some of the "

best that the ‘Hurricanes have
had in some time.

If the Panther defensive back-

ﬁeld tightens up, and team spirit ff,
stays at its present ebb, there may '
just be a_ hurricane in Pittsburgh’

this weekend.
