Lefton Disturbedby SG Bill;
Feels It Infringes on MDC,

By HOBART HARRIS
Harvey Lefton, president

of the Men's . Dorm Council _

(MDC) has taken exception
to the recent Student Gov-

Lashes Out atSG Senator

that Engels believed that this
bill .“would show. that Student
Government was active in other
(than school wide) areas.” He
further believed that Engels’ view-
ed the participation of SG com-

fraternities will hold open houses

beginning at 11:30 p.m. _/

Only one ticket will be sold
for the entire weekend’s events.
Tickets at $5.50 per couple will
be sold at the studenthdesk in
the Cathedral and the Student
Union desk. Tickets for the Holi-
day House will not be sold at the
door, but tickets for the dance
may be purchased Saturday eve-
ning. Tickets will be checked Fri-
day and Saturday nights, accord-
ing to Jimmy Meyerson, Home-
coming chairman.

 

The Committee, which consists of Dorrie Brand and

Ralph Manning, representing the
Student Affairs Committee, and.
Beverly Reifman and Mahmood
Mamdami, representing Student
Government (SG), has met three
times. It has drafted the alloca-
tions procedures and the forms
to be completed by organizations
applying for aid. The committee
is now waiting fbr approval of
these procedures by SG at the
SG meeting tomorrow.

As soon as the procedure is
approved applications for organi-
zations wanting a grant will be
made available. Vrana did not
expect that any money will be
allocated before “the very first

A part of the term.”

Vrana estimated that the ac-
tivities .fee brought in between
$25,000 and $28,000. The only
money taken from the funds so
far has been that for athletic I.D.

cards and a $1,000 allocation to

the Homecoming Committee.
Vrana explained that probably
not all the money will be allo-
cated since the committee ex-
pects to keep an emergency re-
serve fund.

Formerly students had to pay
$1 for their 1.1’). cards. All full-
time students paid the $5 activ-
ities fee on their academic in-

voices this year and received the
I. D. cards free. The $1,000 allo-
cations to Homeéoming, passed at
last Thursday's SG meeting, was
earmarked for an 11th hour at-
tempt to get more entertainment
for the dance this Saturday/ in
the Commons Room. 

According to Vrana, the'ques-
tion of using this money to make‘
up deﬁcits in the accounts of
various student organizations was
never raised. He said the only
way that money would be used
to make up deﬁcits is if ‘a stu-
dent organization makes a re-
quest for money for that purpose.

Any organization which meets
the criteria set -by the commit-.
tee will be able to apply‘ for a
grant. All discussions concerning
ﬁnancial problems with the Com-
mittee will be held in strict _co_n'.
ﬁdence. S ‘  >'

Work was ﬁnally begun on the
allocation of the student activ-
ities fee when SG ‘selected Man-'4
dami and Miss Reifman Oct.'18.
Until then seats to be selected by
SG had been vacant, because SG
had, not agreed to the four maxi
committee plans for the Alloca-:
tions Committee.

John Ruskay, chairman of the

ernment (SG) housing bill
2:5,; which will establish-a com-
}: 37’ mittee to investigate the social

   
 

‘regulations in the men's and
women's dormitories.

’ His basic objection is that at its
ﬁrst meeting of the year MDC
estab\lished a similar committee
which is scheduled to report at
the ,MDC meeting today. The
committee consisted of six sen-
ators who sampled the opinions
of Towers residents and counse-
lors. Included in its report will
be a set of recommendations
which MDC will send to the ad-

 ministration for consideration.

Lefton was especially critical
of SG Senator Mike Ruxin, who,
according to Lefton, said that

MDC has done nothing on this ,

subject. “I take issue with him,”
Lefton stated. “He was misin-
formed.” Lefton pointed out that
he had been in touch with sev-
eral members of SG, including
John Ruskay and Marty Engels,
co-sponsors of the_ senate bill,
before it was passed.

_Roy Meckler, one of the SG ,
senators who 013110866 the bill. 

said he also had spoken  E1!‘
in <t-xvresse -91!’? D99“

with Engels, but outlined a posi-
tion similar to.Ruxin’s. After stat-
ing that “there is a serious prob-
lem and no one has monopoly on
ideas,” he went’ on to observe
that “there has been inaction by
MDC for several years concerning
this problem. This lack of deci-
sive moral action on a serious
problem upsets‘, a great deal of
men residing in the dorms.”

Lefton, however, pointed out
that any action on the part of
SG in this area would be a dup-
lication of what already is being
done. He considered the MDC ef-
fort to be more than adequate,
and that any additional studies
by SG would place MDC in “an
awkward position” as a sort of
competitor of SG for approval by
the administration in an area Lef-
ton cons_iders to be MDC’s re-
sponsibility.

Finally, he felt that legislation
of this sort should be developed
by the dormitory students alone,

SG, "a body of students who are
not necessarily directly effected

search for mischief leads to its
own undoing. Volpone, the fox,
and his servant Mosca, the ﬂy,
—,l_iave played a game for three
"years with Voltore, Corbaccio,
and Corvina, who claims to be
::V'olpone’s friends, but are ac-

that they are to be the heirs _of

 They are so ruled by greed

hope of reward. Bonario sees the

J Risque Outlook

By JAY D. GLASSER

Vuolpone, the current University Theater production,

 presents a risque view of liga, in 16th century Venice, in the .
~ form.-of a satirical comedy-drama by Ben Jonson. The mood

. is colorful and gay, with the lighting and costumes comple-

 menting the ornate sets. But the grotesque is also present

in the makeup of the eunuch and hermaphrodite, and in the

character of some of the scenes. S’ / -

the virtuous Celia and Bonario
triumph. _ ~

Richard Galuppi, who is consi-
dered Pittsburgh’s leading actor,
and John Kritch of Florida's
Asolo Theater as Volpone and
Mosca, give excellent perform-
ances as the “conoisseur of pleas-
ure”land his parasite who plays
one trick to many. Casey O’Mara,
as the hermaphrodite, and Con-
stance Hipwell as Celia also play-
ed their roleswell as the much
abused women, and the rest of
the supporting cast also gave ﬁne
performances.

The sets and costumes were
beautifully done, and the light-
ing, especially in the montebank _
scene where the torch light cast
erie shadows, complemented them
well. The risque and sexy air of
the play is present throughout,
and the grotesque is evident in
the scene where Mosca and the
three old men stand poised like
birds of prey over the stage. The
play moved along well, keeping
the audience's attention despite

I the three hour length of the play.‘

exia-ms and indeﬁnite deadines for
assignments, he attempted to of-
fer a solution to the problem.

Marianne Walko, graduate stu-
dent in education, limited her in-
troductory statement to the mor-
al transition in the coeds on the
University campus. She felt that
the girls wereibasically attempt-
ing to identify themselves in the‘
midst of a massive amount of
freedom. She stressed that par-
ents should not be shocked with
the change in their daughters’
ideals and behavior, and should
never’ ignore their daughters

Dr. Warren T. Hill, director of
the University Counseling Center,
concluded the introductory state-

moral problem today is that “we
must transcend the image of the
machine." He said that sex had
become a commodity, to be

The Pittsburgh Opera opened its 27th annual season

with a masterful production of “Don Carlos’
evening at the Syria Mosque.

Thursday

“Don Carlos” is one of the prolific Verdi’s lesser operas.

For a long time it has been panned by the critics and re- '

jected by the public for its 31/2 hour rambling void of any
famous aria. Only recently has it been gaining popularity.
With its stirring Pittsburgh premiere “Don Carlos” de-
servedly won many more fans.

The plot of “Don Carlos," adopt
ed from Schiller’s drama of the
same name, is relatively simple.
The background is mid-16th cen-
tury Spain in the heat of the In-
quisition. King Phillip II of Spain
has married Elisabeth of France.
But she loves Philip's son, Don
Carlos, and the son loves his new
step-mother. To- complicate the
triangle, Princess Eboli, the King's
secret mistress, is also in’ love

with Don Carlos. With Rodrigo,’

his ally in love and in war, the
deﬁant prince champions the
cause of the persecuted Flemish
against his father and the Grand
Inquisitioner. K

Cast in the role of Phillip II,
Metropolitan Opera star Ezio Fla-
gello gave a memorable perform-

._ance. His rich deep Voice thor-
oughly captivated the audience,
especially in his monologue “Ella.
giammai n"amo.”

Another Met star, Nell Rankin,
was similarly outstanding as the
seductive Princess Eboli. With a
well trained beautiful voice and
a coniplete understanding of her
part, Miss Rankin deserved the
loud ovations that she won.

Also in ﬁne voice were Man-
uel An’seni as Rodrigo, Carlo
Cossutta as Don Carlos, and Rosa

On Exchange Tour

By ALAN DISLEB

The consensus of five ex-
change students visiting the
University from Tuskegee
Institue in Alabama is that
students here are difficult to
meet and socialize with; not

only with strangers but with each
other. The students were on cam-

pus ‘last week under‘ the~aus-:
pices of the University YMCA

chapter.

\ “We haven’t really met the
students,” they said. “There is a
reserved student body’ here.
Everyone is moving so fast. At
Tuskegee, we would never pass
anyone without saying hello.”

According to University Y di-

rector Frank Watanabe, the idea_

for the exchange" “came out of
the concern of a few of us who
had gone to Kentucky for the
VISTA On-Site Conference. We
felt there was a need for students
from this area to be exposed_to
other campuses.” .

The students met with faculty
and ‘administration for informal
discussions. They toured the Y’s
at Carnegie Tech and downtown.
They also visited junior colleges
in the area and toured downtown
Pittsburgh and Oakland. They
also, visited a steel mill. They
were entertained by various com-
munity groups, including the Tus-
kegee Alumni in Pittsburgh.

Purpose of the program is to

‘foster the exchange of ideas, po-

litical and social, between aca-
demic communities. According to
Watanabe, a group of students
from the University will visit
the Tuskegee Campus. Those in-
terested should contact him in
210 SU. /

The students were not impress-
ed with the city of Pittsburgh.

Women Point To
Tower C Thefts

Editor, The Pitt News:

L Many fellow graduate students,
both men and women, here in
Tower C implore you to publish
this letter. We ask the student
body, faculty and other concern-
ed persons to exert pressure in
 whatever way they consider feas-
ible, upon our Board of Trustees
and administration whose compe-
tence and list of ﬁnancial prior-
ities is a proven travesty.

A deplorable situation exists
on the graduate women’s ﬂoors,
and its contagion potential I fear
is high. In the past three weeks
three thefts have occurred by
three different young men. No
one knows whether they are col-
lege students or outsiders. How-
ever, at least two of them have
certain amazingly similar char-
acteristics: they were well dress-
_, ed, “struck” on a weekend night,
" raided the same floors (so far as
we know), and used the same
method of ramsacking those
V rooms of girls who were momen-
tarily out of their room and had
‘left their doors ajar.

" On all these occasions sizable
amounts of money were stolen,
the wallets and purses later
1, /found on the stairwells. And in
 wallrthe incidents the men were
‘ "seen by as many as three girls
who unfortunately were unable
to prevent their escape. In the
" latest tileft, the burglar shoved a
girl who was courageously at-
1 tempting to halt his passage.
‘Thefts I are frightening and dis-
ﬁturbing enough, but let us not
assume that all thieves are this

_ The causes of a problem of this
nature are many, one of which

Lefton Clarifies
Tower C Issue

Editor, The Pitt News:

Editor William Cabin has gross-
ly misrepresented both my posi-
tion and that of the Men’s Dormi-
tory Council (MDC) in his Fri-
day editorial, entitled ‘.‘MDC -
Tower C Exists.” There are sev-
veral issues concerning Tower C
representation and the policy for
use of the Towers Lobby which
must be clariﬁed. _ ,

Tower C holds 451 students,
not 1,400 students. There are ap-
proximately 174 graduate men in
Tower C. These men have never
elected to send representatives
to the Dorm Council. I might
point out for Editor Cabin’s' edi-
fication, that the Constitution of
the Men's Dormitory Council
states in its preamble that the
Council is composed of the resi-
dents of the Men’s Residence
Halls. No prohibition is made on
graduate men or women students.
The Constitution merely requires
that the residents of Tower C
form Houses and send three rep-

resentatives to MDC. Tower C‘

residents have refused to do this.
To say that these people are un-
represented is to say that the
40 million people who did not
vote in the 1960 election were
unrepresented.

The women in Tower C could
also have representatives on MDC
if they wish. The executive board
of MDC is trying to provide the
undergraduate women of Tower
C representation by working with
their chosen representative,
Women's Housing Board.

Two individuals were not al-
lowed to speak at the MDC meet-
ing -because MDC runs by the
rules which govern the U.S. Sen-
ate; these spectators were not
there as official representatives
of Tower C but as interested par-
ties. They made no effort before
the meeting to state their views;
in fact, they‘ entered the meeting
late. Mr. Frand also failed to
present after the meeting the pe-
tition he allegedly circulated. ,

I am supposed to have said

that “the wishes of Tower C res-

idents had been ignored”; what
"I didsay was that Tower C. had

ignored their privilege of repre-
sentation, but’ if they ever do
send representatives, they could
move to amend the policy in the
future. In a talk with one of the
counselors of Tower C, it was
pointed out to me that the grad-
uate men had little interest in
MDC. Perhaps Mr. Cabin’s edi-
torial should have read “Tower
C-—MDC Exists.”

In the future, rather than heap-

oil or myself, Mr. Cabin will be-

well-advised to, present all the
facts. Many members of the
Council met with other student
leaders last Monday in a hearing
on the policy for the Towers Lob-
by. _Mr. Cabin conveniently for-
got to mention this, although he
was present for part of the meet-
ing. -
Outspoken editorials are al-
ways met with interest when
they are bapsedlon fact. If Editor

_ Cabin’ felt strongly about Tower ’
C representation, it was his duty

to personally attend the MDC
meeting, not send a reporter.
Sarcasm, poor reporting, and mis-
represented facts should never
ﬁnd their way into editorials.

I would -like to inform Mr.
Cabin that MDC is aware of the
existence of Tower C; I hope
that ‘in the future he will be
aware of the existence of the
MDC Constitution and of the val-
ue of responsible editorials.

Student Urges
War Against K.

‘Editor, The Pitt News:

On October 27, about 1,500 Uni-
versity students demonstrated
their support for our govern-
ment’s policy in Vietnam. Fifteen
hundred students were gung ho
for the war against the Com-
munist. -'

The Pitt students spoke out
ﬁrmly against the “unshaven min-
ority” (what being urishaven has
to do with the war in Vietnam
is beyond me). Signs like “Down
with Draft Dodgers” do not ex-
press support for the war in
Vietnam. They are more like at-
tacks against those—you know—-
beatniks. That childhood belief
of the goods guys and bad guys,
black and white, right and wrong,
etc.-

It's a good feeling to give all
your strength and support to a
demonstration that protests the
guys who are all bad. So it was
in England during World War II.
So it was in Nazi Germany dur.
ing World War II. So it is in the
Soviet Union today. So it is in
America today. So it was through-
out all the centuries of war.

But is it not these “draft
dodgers,” or “beatniks,"\or “uni
shaven minorities,” who are al-
most solely waging war on a

battleﬁeld. of ignorance, , bigotry, ’

The

and hate: a battleﬁeld that is,

larger and bloodier than any of
us can conceive or would like to
admit. Who is waging the war
against that army of shame that
is lead by “that great American
institution”-—the Klu Klux Klan.
Who is trying (and vainly--due
to lack of support) to prevent
this country from rotting like the
Roman Empire? Who is dying
down South? - ‘

Urbaitis Blasts
Denial of Speech

Editor, The Pitt News:
There have been certain mis-

understandings b e tw e en Mr.
Vrana and myself. in the past few

‘ weeks, but this is not the point

of question at this present mo-
ment.

At the Student Government
(SG) meeting,‘ Thursday, on two
separate occasions a motion was
brought before the senate to sus-
pend the rules and interrupt the
adgenda to allow Mr. Vrana and
myself to speak to clarify my res-
ignation. The senate twice de-
feated the motions.

It is not the fact that neither
Mr. Vrana (an adviser of SG)
nor myself were permitted to
speak, but that senate would
deny any student or any mem-
ber of the administration an op-
portunity to clarify an issue
which directly involved SG it-
self.-

Neither'Mr. Vrana nor myself .

were given the opportunity to
‘present information which was
extremely timely and important
to SG. If this is the interpreta.
tion that some of the members
of SG have of democracy, then
,SG at this University is truly a

Professor Views
History of Song

Editor, The Pitt News:

In reply to a recent letter by‘
five University students, entitled
“Alma Mater Compared to Nazi
Anthem,” I should like to give
you a few historical facts which
may be of interest to the Univer-
sity community.

The melody used for our Uni-
versity’s Alma Mater was com-
posed by Joseph Haydn (1732- Q
1809), an Austrian composer of
182 symphonies, 77 string-quar-.
tettes and 24 operas and ora-
torios This tune had been used
for the Austrian Kaiser-hymne
or Imperial Anthem (Gott Er-
halte Franz den Kaiser—rough-’
ly equivalent to God Save the
King), and /was played for the
ﬁrst time on February 12, 1797.

Forty-four years later, in Aug-
ust, 1841, a German -poet, linguist. 
and historian of literature, I-Ioff- 
man von Fallersleben (1798-
l874), wrote the text of the Deut-
schlandlied, while staying on the
tiny island of Helgoland in the

.North Sea. It began with the

words: Deutschland, Deutschland
uber alles.

After the founding of the Ger-
man Empire in 1871, this text as
well as Haydn’s melody was 
chosen as the German National‘
Anthem. Both the Weimar Re-
public and Hitler's dictatorship’
adopted this song as the national
anthem, although the Nazis in-
sisted on using an additional
song, Die Fahne Hoch, which had
to be sung at each official func-
tion after the Deutschlandlied.

On May 2, 1952, President
Theodore Heuss’proclaimed the
third stanzo of Hoffman von Fall-
ersleben’s song, then 111 years " '
old, as the official anthem of the
Federal Republic of (West) Ger-
many. The English translation
follows: ‘ ..

Law Service

A Law School Placement Serv-
ice (LSPS) has been created to
aid law school applicants in se-
lecting law schools suited to their
qualiﬁcations and preferences.
The University has been chosen
as a test campus for this service.

Formerly, pre-law students have
not had sufficient information to
‘equip them to make intelligent
choices as to which law school
to apply. Many decisions are
based on purely subjective fac-
tors, which usually result in
wasted application fees.

The LSPS feeds pertinent data
on the participating law schools
into computers. The student
then submits his Law School Ap-

Q, titude Test scores and such in-

formation as geographical prefer-
ences and ﬁnancial situation. The
LSPS will select the proper law
schools to which the student
should apply. _ ,

If the student expresses a de-
sire to attend a particular school,
but is evidently not qualiﬁed ‘for

entrance, LSPS will advise him ,

of that fact and direct him to a
more suitable school.

In other action, WPDU won six
out of seven debates at the Public

two weeks ago. The Union de-
bated the Notre Dame Universi-
ty team on the topic “Resolved:
That the United States Should

Union debaters Steve Leight-

resented the University before
approximately 5,000 students.

.an opportunity to play. He stands
C 6'4” and runs the hundred yard
; dash in about 10 seconds ﬂat. His
3 height gives him a tremendous
advantage over defensive backs
,which his speed is an obvious
fasset.
“I love to go deep,” Longo said.
“I’d have to say that my fav-
orite pattern is just a simple
' fake, turn on the speed, and beat
the defender on the ﬂy.”

’ There is one basic problem in

that type of pass play. The end
"must be able to set up the de-
fensive man by running a lot of
short patterns first. In Longo’s
case, this has been virtually im-
possible to achieve,

“I haven’t"' been in the games
long enough to set up anybody,”
?he noted. “When I go in, it’s us-
ually for only one or two plays.
That’s the key to everything. If
r ‘I could stay in the game for a
series of plays or two, I know
that I could get open and get
open often.”

While Longo is conscious of go-
ving deep on every play to utilize
his speed, he realizes that a great
‘deal of value could come from
the short hook or curl patterns.
W“Nobody could stop a pass about
nine feet off the ground," he
pointed out. “I’d run a short pat-
tern, curl in towards the quarter-
back and outleap most any de-
fender for the ball. I only won-
der why the play hasn't been
tried yet.”

V‘ Longo has a minor fault that
is probably true of most inexperi-
enced receivers. He comes out of
the huddle and lines up diﬂerent-
..ly when he is the primary tar-
get of the quarterback than when
he is only a decoy. “I try to look
the same," Longo explained. “But

In the one game that Longo
started, against Miami, he made
a remarkable diving catch of a

Kenny Lucas pass on the ﬁrst’

play from scrimmage. “I was very
surprised to ﬁnd out that I was
starting,” Longo said. “I really
wanted to make up for the touch-
down pass that I dropped against
Navy, and Lucas gave me the
chance.” '

Longo has nothing but praise
for his quarterback. “He has one
tremendous arm,” he said. “Luke
can throw long or‘ short; it makes

no difference.” Longo’s only com-'

plaint is that he isn’t onithe re-

 Sigma Chi, Theta Chi Gain Finals;

Phi Ep, Phi Kap, ZBT Advance

By ROY JACOBS

Sigma Chi and Theta Chi
copped berths in the ﬁnals
of their respective intramur-
al football leagues with vic-
tories’ Monday at Schenley
Oval. Sigma Chi stands alone
in the IFC “A” league after’ de-
feating Pi Lambda Phi on total
yardage, while Theta Chi over-
whelmed Phi Gamma Ddta, 27-0,
to lead the IFC “B” standings.

In other competition, Phi Epsi-
lon Pi bounced back to edge Del-
ta Sigma Phi, 13-6, in “A” league;
Phi Kappa Theta and Zeta Beta
Tau eliminated Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon and Pi Kappa Alpha, re-
spectively, in the “B” league...

Sigma Chi and Pi Lam battled
to a 0-0 tie through four quar-
ters and a ﬁve minute overtime.
Then in the second overtime,
which is decided by total yard-
age gained on four downs, Sigma
Chi outgainedrthe losers, 18-3, as
Jim Dainiell gained the yardage
on a sweep around right end.
Mike Sawicki threw the key
block. A

Twice Sigma Chi thwarted Pi
Lam scoring attempts from inside
the eight-yard line, once in the
second quarter and again in the
fourth period. Sawicki, Simon
Oderberg, and Dave Weirsma pro-
vided an excellent pass rush for
the winners.

Quarterback Tony Liberati
ﬁred four scoring passes as de-
fending champion Theta Chi
trounced Phi Gamma Delta. Sal
Conte caught passes of 30 and 17
yards for two second quarter
touchdowns, and Mike Bock grab-
bed scoring strikes of six and 15
yards in the third period. Bock
also scored two PAT’s and Don
Risko added one. Phi Gain notch-
ed. one ﬁrst down the entire
game.

Defending campus champs Phi
Ep, having lost to Sigma Chi,
came back to defeat the Delta
Sig’s. On the ﬁrst play from
scrimmage following an intercep-
tion, Carl Kaplan raced 25 yards
on a pass from Andy Wiener for
Phi Ep’s ﬁrst score. Kaplan scored
again in the second quarter on

_ a 20-yard pass from Wiener.

Two other times Phi E1) was on
the Delta Sig’s three but couldn’t
score because time ran out. Dave
Bi-inn intercepted three passes for
the winners.

Phi Kappa Theta held on to an
early lead to defeat SAE, 13-7.
Rich Erderlyi passed for one TD,
caught another scoring pass, and
intercepted two passes for the
winners. His pass, on the, half-
back option, was a 63-yarder to
Mike Fitch. Erderlyi scored him-
self on a 12-yard pass from Ed
Stack in the second period. George
Lies added the one PAT for Phi

Kap.

y The behavior of unions and
employers and the effects of fed-
eral labor legislation will be
studied by faculty members of

iversity in a research project

tion.

Ross, professor in the Universi-

 Dr. Ross, whose book Govern-

Brown University Press, expects
to yield information on the effect
-of increased government control
upon union management and the
_ effects of the Labor Management
Disclosure and Reporting Act of
1959 upon membership participa-
ctionin union activities. The study
« "should also provide a way to im-
. prove the law by liberalizing,

Some questions which the study

come are and how it is spent,
